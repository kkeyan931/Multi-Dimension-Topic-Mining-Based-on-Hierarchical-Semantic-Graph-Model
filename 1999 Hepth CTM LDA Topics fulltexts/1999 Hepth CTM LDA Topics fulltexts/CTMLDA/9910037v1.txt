1 introduction

the ddimensional antide sitter space adsd is a homogeneous space with constant neg-
ative curvature and cosmological constant. its symmetry group so(2, d  1) plays the role
of the ddimensional poincare group, which is recovered in the at limit by a contraction.
it is of considerable interest in theoretical physics for several reasons. for example, it can be
used as a simple model for eld theory on curved spaces [11], and it arises naturally in the
context of supergravity [40]. recently, an interesting conjecture relating string or m theory
on adsd  w with (super)conformal eld theories on the boundary has been proposed [26],
where w is a certain sphere or a product space containing a sphere. moreover, there is
some evidence that a full quantum treatment would lead to some nonclassical version of
the manifolds. this includes the appearance of a stringy exclusion principle [27] in the
spectrum of elds on ads space.

in this paper, we study a noncommutative version of the ads space, which is covariant
under the standard drinfeldjimbo quantum group soq(2, d  1). it can be understood as
a quantization of a certain poisson structure on the classical ads space, where q  1 is a
deformation parameter which plays the role of the planck constant. in principle, this is can
be done for real q and q a phase. for real q, the qualitative features of quantum groups and
spaces are typically similar to the classical case; in particular, no cuto is expected.

here we consider the case where q is a root of unity. it is wellknown that then quantum
groups show completely new, nonperturbative features; roughly speaking, phenomena
which are typical for innitedimensional representations of classical noncompact groups
occur already with nitedimensional representations. in particular, it has been shown that
there exist nitedimensional unitary representations of the quantum ads groups at roots
of unity [37, 6], where all the features of the classical case are consistently combined with a
cuto.

the correct denition of quantumads space for q a phase is not obvious; dierent ver-
sions have been proposed in the literature [4, 13], which are not very satisfactory or incom-
plete. the rst goal of this paper is to clarify this situation, and to give a precise denition in
terms of operators on hilbert spaces. to nd the proper denition, we make 2 basic assump-
tions: 1) covariance under the qdeformed universal enveloping algebra uq(so(2, d  1)),
and 2) allowing only nitedimensional representations, hence insisting on a full regular-
ization and avoiding qanalysis. it is very remarkable that this is indeed possible, while
maintaining the correct lowenergy limit.

as we will show, these assumptions lead to an algebra of functions on the complexied
quantum sphere, which decomposes into dierent sectors corresponding to dierent real
forms. they describe the compact sphere sd
q and certain noncompact forms, in particular
the quantum antide sitter space adsd
q . this will provide us with scalar elds which are

1

unitary representations of uq(so(2, d1)), and correspond to the classical squareintegrable
scalar elds on ads space, describing spin 0 elementary particles. the remarkable dierence
to the classical case is that all this happens within the framework of polynomial functions,
whose properties are completely dierent from the classical case. nevertheless, the classical
elds are recovered in the limit of q approaching 1.
in particular, this allows to study
questions of functional analysis in the classical case with purely algebraic methods.

moreover, it will turn out that the denition of adsd
q

implies a number of additional,
unexpected features. they include the appearance of an additional undeformed symmetry
group so(d + 1) if d is odd and sp(d) if d is even, which are in some sense spontaneously
broken [37]. moreover, it turns out that the quantum spaces are obtained most naturally as
product of the quantum ads space (or sphere) with a classical sphere. more precisely, one
obtains the products ads2r+1
/, where  = (z2)r, and s4r1
is a certain chiral sector of s4r1. the quotients of the classical spaces are actually twisted
sectors of orbifolds. it should be emphasized that no specic assumptions have been made
here, it is simply a consequence of the remarkable structures that appear at roots of unity.
of course, this is quite intriguing in the context of the adscft correspondence mentioned
above, since we obtain ads3
, which are precisely cases of
interest there (apart from the chiral sector of s7, whose meaning is not entirely clear).
these and other physical aspects will be discussed further in section 7.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, some basic facts about quantum groups
and spaces are reviewed, including aspects of the representation theory at roots of unity
which will be needed. in section 3, we discuss in detail the meaning of reality structures,
and determine the real form of the quantum ads group uq(so(2, d2)). section 4 is devoted
to a closer analysis of the structure of polynomial functions on the complex quantum spaces
at roots of unity. in section 5, we identify dierent noncompact sectors, which leads to the
denition of hilbert spaces of scalar elds. their product structure with classical spheres is
analyzed in section 5.2. sections 5.3 and 5.4 are mathematical interludes, and will allow us
to write down explicitly the star structure of the real quantum spaces in theorems 5.3 and
5.4, which are some of the main results of this work. in section 6, we comment on further
developments towards formulating physical models, and propose an onshell condition which
is somewhat reminiscent of string theory. some physical aspects are discussed in section 7.
the appendices include several proofs that were omitted in the text, as well an exposition
of the vector representations of so(d) for convenience.

some advice to the reader: in sections 5.3 and 5.4, the star structure is dened in several
steps, and considerable eort is made to give the precise mathematical denitions and to
explain why it is the correct one. however the nal result, theorems 5.3 and 5.4 can be
stated very briey. thus the reader who is not interested in the mathematical details may
skip much of these sections and simply accept the results.

2 the basic algebras

we rst recall the classical antide sitter space adsd1, which is a (d  1) dimensional
manifold with constant negative curvature and signature (+,, ...,). it can be embedded
in a ddimensional at space with signature (+, +,, ...,) by

1 + z2
z2

d  z2

2  ...  z2

d1 = r2,

(2.1)

where r will be called the radius of the ads space. the group of isometries of this space
is so(2, d  2), which plays the role of the (d  1) dimensional poincare group.
this space has some rather peculiar features. its timelike geodesics are nite and closed,
and the time translations is the u(1) subgroup of rotations in the (z1, zd) plane. the
spacelike geodesics are unbounded. there exist nice unitary positiveenergy representations
of so(2, d2) which correspond to elementary particles with arbitrary spin. it is also worth
recalling that so(2, d  2) is the conformal group in d  2 dimensions acting on (d  2)
dimensional minkowski space, which can be interpreted as the boundary of adsd1.
to dene the noncommutative version, we rst review some basic facts about the q
deformed orthogonal group and euclidean space [8]; for a more detailed discussion see e.g.
[9, 35]. the algebra of functions funq(so(d, c)) on the orthogonal quantum group is
generated by matrix elements ai

(2.2)

where the matrix rik
mn is explained below. funq(so(d, c)) is the hopf algebra dual to the
quantized universal enveloping algebra uq(so(d, c)), which is easier to work with in practice.
given a root system of a simple lie group g with killing metric ( , ) and cartan matrix aij,
uq := uq(g) is the hopf algebra with generators {x 
i , hi; i = 1, ..., r} and relations [16, 7, 8]

checked explicitly.

the cartanweyl involution is dened as

(x 

i ) = x

(hi) = hi,

(2.8)

extended as a linear antialgebra map; in particular, (q) = q for any q  c. it is obviously
consistent with the algebra, and one can check that

(  )(x) = ((x)),
s((x)) = (s1(x)).

(2.10)

borel subalgebras u ,0
can be dened in the obvious way. this denes a quasitriangular
hopf algebra, which means that there exists a special element r  uq uq which satises

for any x  uq, and other properties which will not be used explicitly. here (x) =   (x)
is the ipped coproduct. there are explicit formulas for r, of the form [20, 19]

as was shown in [7], the following remarkable element

v = (sr2)r1q2

(2.13)

is in the center of uq, and will be called drinfeldcasimir. here  is dual to the weyl vector

q and sd1
q,c

(2.20)
for u  uq(so(d, c)). we will usually work with the latter, which is more familiar from the
classical lie algebras; then i

using (2.6), as it must be. the other relations can be checked similarly.

(2.21)

2note that q1 = q for so(2r), and q1 = q2 for so(2r + 1). this is necessary to be compatible with uq, as

will be checked below. in [8], the conventions are such that q1 is replaced by q.

the algebra of functions adsd1

dening the quantum antide sitter space will be
dened as a real form of this complex quantum sphere, with a (co)action of the quantum
anti-de sitter group. therefore as an algebra, it is again dened by (p )ij
kltitj = 0, t2 = 1.
one could introduce a physical scale by setting

q

yi := tir

(2.22)

for a constant r > 0, so that y2 = r2. we will simply use the units dened by r = 1;
physically speaking, the scale will be set by the radius of ads space.

so far, all these spaces are complex. the crucial issue is to nd the correct denition of
the corresponding real quantum spaces. this is not obvious especially if q is a phase, and in
fact dierent possibilities have been proposed in the literature [4, 13]. this will be discussed
in detail in later sections.

2.1 roots of unity and representations

since we are primarily interested in the case where q is a root of unity, we will consider a more
powerful version of the above, the socalled restricted specialization u res
(so(d, c))
[22] with generators x (k)
for k  n as well as hi. for generic q, i.e. q not a root
of unity, this is the same as before. however if q is a root of unity,

= (x 
i )k
[k]qi !

:= u res

q

q

i

q = e2in/m

(2.23)

with m and n relatively prime, then [k]q becomes 0 for certain k. denote with m the smallest
positive integer such that q2m = 1, i.e. [m]q = 0. thus m = m if m is odd, and m = m/2
if m is even. more generally for qi = e2idin/m, let mi be the the smallest integer such that

[mi]qi = 0.

(2.24)

then mi divides m; similarly, m and d are dened for any root .

q

contains the additional generators x (mi)

the important point is that u res
, which have
a welldened coproduct, and thus act on tensor products of representations. in particular,
(x 
i )mi = 0 in u res
. therefore u res
contains a remarkable subhopf algebra u f in
(the small
quantum group) generated by x 
i and hi. here we have slightly changed the standard
convention and included the hi as well, slightly abusing the name nite. this is more
appropriate for our purpose.

we will only consider nitedimensional representations in this paper. the cartan gen-

(,) is the coroot of . the fundamental weights i

and span the lattice of integral weights. the irreducible highestweight representations with
highest weight  will be denoted by lres().

< hi, j >= ij,

(2.26)

it is wellknown [31] that for generic q, the representation theory is essentially the same
as in the classical case. in particular, all nitedimensional representations (=modules) of
u res

are direct sums of some lres(). their character

q

(lres()) = ex>0

dim lres()e =: ()

(2.27)

is given by weyls formula. here lres() is the weight space of lres() with weight   .
the irreducible highest weight representations of u f in
the value of the drinfeldcasimir v (2.13) on lres() (and on any highestweight module
with highest weight ) was rst determined in [30]:

q will be denoted by lf in().

v  w = qcw for w  lres(),

(2.28)

where c = (,  + 2) is the value of the classical quadratic casimir on l(). in particular
for highest weights of the form  = k1, the classical casimir for so(2r + 1) is

and for so(2r) it is

ck1 = 2k2 + 2k(d  2),

ck1 = k2 + k(d  2).

(2.29)

(2.30)

finally, we quote a few important facts about irreducible representations at roots of unity.
the rst one [2, 5] states that the structure of lres with small highest weight  is the same
as classically:

theorem 2.1 assume that  is a dominant integral weight with ( + , )  md for all
positive roots . then the highest weight representation lres() has the same character  as
in the classical case, given by weyls character formula.

this follows from the strong linkage principle, which was rst shown in [2]; for a more
elementary approach, see [38]. moreover, lf in() = lres() for these weights , since the
x (mi)

act trivially.

i

7

for general , the structure of lres() is dicult to analyze. however for the special

weights

z =x mizii

for zi  z

(2.31)

it can be understood easily, and this will be the key for much of the following. first, we note
the following simple relation:

[x +

i , (x 

i )k] = (x 

i )k1[k]qi[hi  k + 1]qi.

it implies that for any highest weight module u res

q

 wz with highest weight z,

i := x 
i

 wz

(2.32)

(2.33)

is a highest weight vector (possibly zero) for any i, i.e. x +
i
lres(z) is irreducible by denition, this implies that

 j = 0 for all i, j. because

do act nontrivially on lres(z),

in lres(z). in particular, the irreducible representations lf in(z) of u f in
dimensional. however the large generators x (mi)
as we will see next.

 u res
using the commutation relations, any element of u res
the form z = z pi nimii with ni  n. in other words, lres(z) is a direct sum of
onedimensional representations lf in(z) of u f in
, since all z are special points. in fact,
the weights z have the structure of a weight lattice with fundamental weights mii. this
turns out to be the rescaled lattice of a dual lie algebra g, with cartan matrix aij = aji
provided (4.2) holds [37]. in the present case, g = so(d) if d is even, and g = sp(d 1) if d
is odd. in fact, u res
contains a corresponding classical lie algebra as a quotient. this is
the essence of a remarkable result of lusztig [23], and can be made explicit as follows ([37],
theorem 4.2):

(so(d)) can be written as a sum
. it follows that all weights of lres(z) have

u f in

ivz.

theorem 2.2 for all special weights z, lres(z) is an irreducible highestweight represen-
tation of the classical universal enveloping algebra u(g), with generators x 
if

i and hi.

in particular if z is a dominant weight, then the character of lres(z) is invariant under the
weyl group, and can be obtained from weyls formula by rescaling the weights accordingly.
using this, the structure of lres() with large dominant integral  can be described as

follows [5]:
theorem 2.3 let z as in (2.31) and 0 be an integral weights with 0  (0, 
all i. then

i ) < mi for

lres(0 + z) = lres(0)  lres(z).

(2.36)

this is not hard to prove, see [5] or [37]. moreover, the generators (2.35) essentially act on
the second factor in (2.36) and u f in

on the rst, but with a certain twisting [37].

3 reality structures and symmetry algebra

since the proper choice of the reality structure is crucial in the following, we rst discuss the
relation of the real structures on the spaces with their symmetry algebras.

the algebra of functions on both classical and quantum ddimensional complex eu-
clidean space is generated by coordinate functions xi, which transform in the vector repre-
sentation vd of uq(so(d, c)). the tensor product of 2 such representations contains a unique
trivial representation; in other words, there is an invariant bilinear form < , >: vdvd  c.
in hopfalgebra language, invariance means < f, g >=< u(1)  f, u(2)  g > for f, g  vd,
where (u) = u  1 + 1  u = u(1)  u(2) denotes the coproduct of u  u(so(d, c)) or uq.
this extends immediately to polynomial functions.
in the classical case, the algebra of complex functions on real euclidean space (or any
real manifold) is equipped with a structure, i.e. an antilinear map whose square is the
identity, dened by the complex conjugation. the above invariant bilinear form then induces
a hermitian inner product by

(f, g) =< f , g >,

(3.1)
which satises (f, g) = (g, f ). the signature (p, d p) of this inner product is the signature
of the (pseudo)euclidean real space, and it is positive denite only in the euclidean case.
but in any case, it denes a structure on the algebra u(so(d, c)), i.e. an antilinear
antialgebra map, by
(3.2)

(f, u  g) = (u  f, g)

9

for all u  u(so(d, c)). this denes the real form u(so(p, d  p)), and one can then study
its unitary representations, which are innitedimensional except in the euclidean case.
in the qdeformed case, we use this connection between the real form of a function space
and its symmetry algebra in the other direction: there will be a clear choice of the real
form of uq, which then determines the real form of the function algebras. a real form or 
structure of uq is an antilinear antialgebra map  on uq whose square is the identity.
an invariant inner product on a representation of uq is a hermitian inner product which
satises (3.2) for all u  uq; in other words, the star on uq is implemented by the adjoint,
which is welldened for nondegenerate inner products. this is particularly intuitive for
elements of uq of the form g = exp(itu) with u = u, since then g = g1.
denite invariant inner product. then

a representation of uq is unitary with respect to a real form of uq if it has a positive

((u)j

i ) = i

j(u)

(3.3)

for any u  uq, in an orthonormal basis.
our guiding principle to nd the appropriate qdeformed real spaces is that the star
structure on uq should admit a suciently large class of unitary representations of the quan-
tum ads group in order to describe elementary particles, in the spirit of wigner. the ads
group is particularly well suited for such an approach, because it has unitary representa-
tions for any halfinteger spin corresponding to massive as well as massless particles with
positive energy, in any dimension. in fact, one can choose the cartan subalgebra such that
the energy is one of its generators, and the unitary representations are then lowestweight
representations with positive energy and discrete spectrum. the unitary representations of
the poincare group are recovered in the at limit. we want to maintain these features in
the qdeformed case. this will uniquely select the real structure.

3.1 star structures on uq
there are essentially 2 types of star structures3 on uq [37], the rst of the form

x 
i

 = six 

i , h 

i = hi,

(3.4)

(3.5)

and the second of the form

x 
i

 = six 

i , h 

i = hi,

3there are additional ones if the dynkin diagram has automophisms, such as for so(2r); they however

do not correspond to antide sitter groups, and do not admit nitedimensional unitary representations.

10

with si = 1. they dene consistent star algebras for both real q and q a root of unity. the
compatibility conditions with the coproduct are dierent for real q and q a phase, which will
show up in dierent reality structures of the associated quantum spaces.

it is known that unitary representations with all desired features exist for the rst type if q
is a root of unity [38, 37], which moreover have an intrinsic cuto and are nitedimensional.
for q  r, unitary representations also exist, but they have no cuto. there also exist
certain unitary representations of the second type for q a phase, e.g.
for uq(so(2, 1)) [32],
but they are not highestweight representations; in particular, the cartan subalgebra cannot
be diagonalized, and the energy is not positive denite. this is expected to hold in higher
dimensions as well. finitedimensional unitary representations cannot exist, since then hi
could be diagonalized with purely imaginary spectrum, which is in contradiction with the
commutation relation (2.4); notice that the cartan subalgebra is distinguished for q 6= 1,
unlike in the classical case. therefore we only consider star structures on uq of the rst type
(3.4) from now on, and concentrate on the case where q is a root of unity.
consider the vector representation vd of uq in more detail, which is a highest weight
representation with highest weight 1 = 1. it is convenient to work with a weight basis xi
for i = 1, ..., d, with weights i for i = 1, ..., d which are given in appendix a. vd is unitary
with respect to the compact form

x 
i

 = x 

i , h 

i = hi,

(3.6)

which denes uq(so(d)) for both real q and q a phase. on highest weight modules, there is a
unique invariant inner product (3.2) for star structures of the type (3.4). the weight vectors
xi are of course orthogonal for dierent weights, and one can dene them to be orthonormal,
i.e.

this is the standard convention in the literature. then the invariant tensor is [8]

(xi, xj) = ij.

now it is easy to nd the denition of uq(so(2, d2)). let e be the element of the cartan
subalgebra which is dual to 1/d1, so that < e,  >= (1, )/d1. then the eigenvalues of
e on vd are ei := (1, i)/d1 = (1, 0, ..., 0,1); e will turn out to be the energy. we claim

4 scalar elds at roots of unity

in order to construct scalar elds on classical ads space which are unitary representations,
one has to consider squareintegrable functions; they are of course not polynomials. the

12

situation for q  r is completely analogous. at roots of unity however, the structure of
polynomials changes completely, and we will see that the analogues of the classical scalar
elds can in fact be written as polynomials in the ti.

to see this, we have to study cd

polynomials m k

in more detail. consider the set of homogeneous

(4.1)

if q is generic, then f (k) is a irreducible representation with highest weight k1 corre-
sponding to a totally (q)symmetric traceless tensor, and m k
q = f (k)  x2f (k  2)  ... as
classically. if q is a root of unity, then m k
q is not completely reducible any more, which is
a typical phenomenon at roots of unity. the full structure of m k
q is quite complicated, and
will be discussed elsewhere. here we only consider those modes which will be needed for the
hilbert space of scalar elds on adsq.

first, we identify the polynomials f (k) in cd
q which have essentially the same structure as
classically, which means the character of lres(k1) is the same as classically. with hindsight,
we restrict ourselves to roots of unity of the form

q = e

i

m1 d1 ,

(4.2)

from now on; the reason for this will become clear later. this corresponds to n = 1 and
m = 2d1m1 according to section 2.1, and md = m for all roots . with this assumption,
theorem 2.1 implies that (lres(k1)) = (k1) for k  m1  (d 3). indeed, any positive
root  can be written as  = p nii with ni  ai, where ai are the coxeter labels. hence
(k1 + , )  kd1 + (d  3)d1, which is  m = d1m1 provided k  m1  (d  3).
[38].
we can assume that k < m1; then it implies that the character of lres(k1) = lf in(k1) is
the same as classically, unless it contains a dominant integral weight  which is in the orbit
of k1 under the weyl group acting with center m11  . since ( 1
k1k, ) = (d  2)/2 by
appendix a, this is only possible for k > ks where

however, this bound can be improved using the strong linkage principle, see e.g.

hence

ks = m1  (d  2)/2.

(lres(k1)) = (k1)

for k  ks.

13

(4.3)

(4.4)

in fact, it turns out that the smallest k where (lres(k1)) is nonclassical for even d is
k = ks + 1, where

(lres((ks + 1)1)) = ((ks + 1)1)  ((ks  1)1).

(4.5)

(for odd d, there is a similar phenomenon). this is related to the scalar singleton eld on
the ads space, as we will see in the next section. one can check that e.g. the casimir v
(2.13) indeed becomes degenerate for these weights.

to summarize, the structure of m k

q is the same as classically for small k:

theorem 4.1 for n0  ks and roots of unity of the form (4.2),
f (n0) = lres(n01) = lf in(n01)
has the same character (n01) as classically. moreover, m n0
q
q = m0kn0/2
(x2)kf (n0  2k).

m n0

is the direct sum

(4.6)

(4.7)

the proof is completed in appendix c. 

next consider f (km1), which is of central importance to us. the highest weight of
f (km1) is a special weight (2.31). using (2.6) and the commutation relations (2.19), one
has

x1x2(x1)n2 + ... + q(n1)/2
)x2(x1)n1

1 + ... + q2(n1)
(1 + q2
[n]q1x2(x1)n1.

(4.8)
since [km1]q1 = 0, it follows that x 
i (x1)km1 = 0 for all i, hence (x1)km1 is a onedimensional
representation of u f in
. as discussed in section 2.1 below (2.34), this implies that all weights
of f (km1) have the form z = p zimi1, and f (km1) is a representation of the classical
universal enveloping algebra u(g) with generators x 
i and hi. moreover, it is a highest
weight module with highest weight vector (x1)km1. by the classical representation theory, it
follows that it is irreducible, hence

q

f (km1) = lres(km11),

(4.9)

which is essentially l(k1) of g.

now consider more generally n = n0 +km1 with 0  n0 < ks and k  n. then both f (n)
and f (n0) f (km1) are highest weight modules with highest weight n1. clearly f (n) 
f (n0)f (km1), by (4.1) and (2.6). on the other hand, f (n0)f (km1)  f (n0) f (km1),
which is isomorphic to lres(n1) by theorem 2.3. hence we have shown that

14

theorem 4.2 for n = n0 + km1 with 0  n0 < ks and k  n,

f (n) = f (n0)f (km1) = f (n0) f (km1) = lres(n1).

(4.10)

in particular, it is essentially the tensor product of f (n0) with the irreducible representation
l(k1) of the classical algebra g.

5 real forms and hilbert space representations of the

quantum spaces

q

and adsd1

q

now we are ready to discuss the reality structure at roots of unity. as was pointed out
before, (3.11) and (3.12) are not consistent with the algebra for q a phase. to nd the
correct denition, we rst construct the hilbert spaces, and then simply calculate the adjoint
of the operators of interest. we want to emphasize that the inner products on irreducible
representations are determined uniquely by (3.2).
indeed on any highest weight module,
there exists a unique (up to normalization) invariant inner product for a given star structure
of the form (3.4). this is because once the inner product is dened on the highest weight
vector, it can be calculated for all descendant vectors using (3.2); in general, it is not unitary.
the resulting invariant inner product is nondegenerate if the representation is irreducible.

we rst discuss the quantum sphere. as representation of u res

q

, we can consider

f (n) = u res

q

 (t1)n  sd1

q,c

(5.1)

instead of (4.1). however, not all these f (n) should be considered as elds on the real
quantum sphere, only those which are unitary representations of the compact form

x 
i

 = x 

i , h 

i = hi,

(5.2)

q

of u f in
(so(d)), with the natural inner product discussed above. it was proved in [37] that
this certainly holds for those lres(k1) = lf in(k1) with k  ks (4.3). here the assumption
(4.2) is important.
hence we could dene a hilbert space of functions on the real quantum sphere to be
the direct sum of all f (k) with k  ks. in order to obtain a simple denition of position

15

operators in section 5.5, we impose the slightly stronger bound k < ks, and dene the
hilbert space of functions on the real quantum sphere to be

sd1

the position operators will be discussed in section 5.5. its generators are essentially the
ti as in section 2; they will have to be slightly modied in order to account for the cuto.
their star structure is determined uniquely by the adjoint on the hilbert space, and will be
given explicitly in section 5.5. sd1
is a truncated version of the classical sphere sd1 =
n0l(n1), which is recovered in the limit m1  , or q  1.
now consider more generally n = n0 + km1 with 0  n0 < ks, so that f (n) =
f (n0) f (km1) according to (4.10). since f (km1) = lres(km11) is a nitedimensional
irreducible representation of the classical g, it has a standard positivedenite invariant inner
product. we just discussed the inner product on f (n0). this suggests a natural positive
denite inner product on f (n) as the tensor product, so that
(k))

(k)) := (f, f )((k), 

(f (k), f 

(5.4)

where f, f   f (n0) and (k), 
(k)  f (km1). this leads to an interesting physical interpre-
tation, as we will see. we will always use an orthonormal basis corresponding to this inner
product from now on.

q

we have seen in the previous section that all weights of lres(km11) have the form z =

pi zimii. therefore f (n) is the direct sum of irreducible representations lf in(n01 + z)
; if the multiplicity of lf in(n01 + z) in f (n) is larger than one, the corresponding
of u f in
subspace can be decomposed as an orthogonal sum of irreducible components. hence f (n)
is a direct orthogonal sum of hilbert spaces of type lf in(n01 + z), with the induced
inner product (5.4), and the dierent components are related by the action of the classical
generators x 
([37],
i
theorem 5.1) with respect to this inner product. the result is

(2.35). one can now calculate the adjoint of the generators on u f in

q

q

. these unitary representations should be viewed as scalar elds on adsd1

representation of the compact form (3.6) and hence a scalar eld on sd1
. if z1 is odd and all
other zi are even, it is a unitary representation of the antide sitter group u f in
(so(2, d 2))
(3.9). moreover, the sectors with dierent z but the same si are equivalent representations
of u f in
, and
correspond to squareintegrable scalar elds on the classical ads space. to understand
this, consider the lf in((2m1  k)1) as lowestweight representations lf in(k1) of u f in
with lowest weight k1. for low energies, they have the same structure as the scalar elds
on the classical ads space, which are irreducible unitary lowestweight representations of
so(2, d  2) realized in terms of squareintegrable functions. it is very remarkable that
they are realized here in terms of polynomials in the coordinate functions. therefore we
dene the hilbert space of functions on the real quantum antide sitter space to be

5.2 product spaces

from the above discussion, it would seem much more natural to consider all polynomials
in the ti instead of just the u f in
 (t1)n. for simplicity, we will restrict ourselves to the
polynomials of the form f (n) = u res
 (t1)n for all km1 < n < km1 + ks and all k  n,
and study their eld content. using (4.10) we can write f (n) = f (n0)f (km1), where the
second factor is essentially the representation l(k1) of the classical symmetry algebra g,
which connects the various components with dierent z. hence

where certain modes were omitted as in section 5.1 for simplicity. for the moment we ignore
the reality structure.

observe that the l(k1) are not arbitrary representations of the classical g, but have

a nice interpretation. consider rst d = 2r. then the dual algebra is eso(2r) = so(2r) as
shown in [37], and l(k1) can be viewed as a function on the classical sphere sd1. hence
knl(k1) = f un(sd1), which is the space of polynomial functions on the classical sphere
sd1.
next, consider d = 2r + 1, which is less obvious. now f (km1) is the highestweight
representation l(k1) of eso(2r + 1) = sp(2r) with highest weight k1. observe that the
2rdimensional representation l(1) is not real, in the sense that the 2r variables zi are
necessarily complex, and can be considered as 4r real variables xi. the compact form
usp(2r) acts by multiplying the zi with a unitary matrix. therefore the radius x2 =pi zizi
is invariant under usp(2r), and the orbit of usp(2r) in l(1) = c2r turns out to be sphere
s4r1 (to see this, one can show that the stabilizer of (1, 0, ..., 0) is usp(2r  2), hence
usp(2r)/usp(2r  2) = s4r1 on dimensional grounds). the set of polynomials of degree
k in the zi is precisely the representation l(k1), hence knl(k1) is the space of those
functions on s4r1 which are induced by holomorphic functions on c2r; for lack of a better
name, we call it the chiral sector s4r1
of s4r1. the full sphere could be obtained by
tensoring s with another (conjugate) chiral sphere.



in summary, we found (ignoring the reality structure) nnf (n) = sd1

now we take into account the star structure (5.5) induced on the various lf in(n01 +
z)  f (km1). as we have seen before, certain sectors z of the modules f (km1) corre-
spond to sd1
, and others yet have not been identied here.
this means that we obtain the product of adsd1
with certain quotients (=orb-
ifolds) of the classical spaces. the functions on the orbifolds are described by functions on
the covering space which are invariant under the action of a certain classical group, possibly
modulo signs (for twisted orbifolds).

to make this more specic, recall that vz  lf in(n01 + z)  f (n) is an element of

sectors of the orbifold m/. in fact, some of these other sectors (which were not considered
so far) are again equivalent to adsd1
. for example for d = 5, all sectors turn out to be
either s4

q . hence they might recombine, and (z2)r might eectively be smaller.

the residual symmetry of g on these orbifolds is [37] su(2)r for d = 2r + 1, and to u(1)r

for d = 2r; in a sense, g is spontaneously broken.

5.3 the universal weyl element 

the appropriate mathematical tool to describe the involution is an element of an extension
of uq by generators i of the braid group, introduced in [19] and [21]. the i act on
representations of u res
for u  uq.
all we need is the generator corresponding to the longest element of the weyl group, .
acting on an irreducible representation,  maps the highest weight vector into the lowest
weight vector of the contragredient (dual) representation, as classically. it has the following
important properties [19, 21]:

sketch short proofs for the general case in appendix b.

for our purpose, we dene a slightly modied element

with the same properties as  except

be called real here if there exists an intertwiner

k(u1)j

for all u  u res

q

, which by standard hopf algebra identities is equivalent to

giji

k(u) = gkl(s(u))l
j,

(5.22)

or (u)t g = g(s(u)) in matrix language. now by (5.19), one can write s(u) = ((u))1,
and one obtains

(u)t = a1(((u)))a,

(5.23)

where a1 = g().

in the classical case, it is known that the real representations of a lie group can be
chosen to be orthogonal or symplectic matrices, in a suitable basis. moreover, a highest
weight representation is real if the highest weight is invariant under the automorphism .
we can show the following related statement in the qdeformed case:

lemma 5.1 if  acts trivially on the dominant integral weight , i.e. < hi,  >=
< (hi),  > for all i, then the automorphism  can be realized as a conjugation on lres(),

((u)) = c(u)c

(5.24)

20

with c 2 = 1, and lres() is real. if lres() is in addition a unitary representation of the
, then there exists an orthonormal basis of lres() such that the
compact form (3.6) of u res
matrices (u)i

j satisfy

(u)t = j 1((u))j

(5.25)

and (5.6) for all u  u res
diagonal with blocks of the form (cid:18) 0 1

1

q

, where j = 1 if l() is orthogonal at q = 1, and j is block

0 (cid:19) if l() is symplectic at q = 1. in this basis,

c  = c and c t = jcj 1.

this is proved in appendix c. an alternative approach has been given in [35]. we will
always use such a basis from now on. even though these properties will be used only for the
vector representation vd in this paper where they can be checked directly, they hold much
more generally. in particular, (5.25) together with (5.23) implies by schurs lemma that the
invariant tensor is given by

g = j t c(1),

(5.26)

where the hat on g will indicate the particular normalization implied by this equation.
further consistency relations of the rmatrix with the invariant tensor follow from (5.14),
see [30] or [35].

now we concentrate on the case of interest here, which is the vector representation
vd = lres(1). since  acts trivially on the highest weight, vd is real, and the invariant
tensor g is nothing but the metric (3.8). moreover vd is orthogonal classically, hence j = 1,
and

(5.27)

(u)t = ((u))
j (1), and c i

q

. therefore gij = c i

for all u  u res
finally, the star structure (3.6) on uq can be extended by  = 1. this is consistent
with (5.14), (5.15) and (5.16) for all real forms (5.5) of uq, and also with the explicit formulas
for . acting with (5.15) on a unitary irreducible representation, it follows by schurs lemma
that ()() = 1, hence () = (), as it should be. by (5.26), this implies that

5.4 preinvolution on the extended coordinate algebras

this generalizes easily for more general algebras generated by generators xi in bigger, real
representations. the rmatrix involved in xi essentially corrects the ip in the conjugation
of the coproduct of uq which occurs if q is a phase. in the form with l, a somewhat similar
formula was proposed in [24] in a dierent context. however, we use it as an intermediate
step towards the correct physical involution. the two formulas for xi are identical, because

proof one has to verify that the map is consistent with (5.29); this is done in appendix
c. the verication that xi = vxiv1 is immediate if one uses  = 1 and c  = c t = c.
recall that we do not consider spinorial representations here, so  = 1 in (5.16). in the more
downtoearth version with l, the calculation is more complicated, and sketched in the
appendix c.

the bar is compatible with (p )ij

klxixj = 0, using the fact that r = r1; note that for

to see the last relation, observe that c i

even d, r commutes with c  c, because r is invariant under the automorphism .
l gij is also an invariant tensor, hence it is
proportonal to gkl, and in fact it is equal to gkl (consider e.g. the highest weight state, where
c = 1). by (5.26), this implies that c() = ()c and therefore g2 = q(d1)/2
(v) = 1,
so that g1 is equal to g. this is known explicitly for vd. hence (5.33) follows from
x2 1 = x2, since x2 is a singlet. therefore the bar is welldened on sd1

5.5 position operators and star structure

we concentrate on sd1
from now on. the generators ti dene linear operators on sd1

q,c
and we now restrict them to the real sphere sd1
= 0n0<ks f (n0). since tif (k) 
f (k + 1)  f (k  1) and using the fact that all f (k) for 0  k < ks + 1 are linearly
independent by theorem 4.7, the projector

acts on sd1
, and generates the algebra of functions on the real quantum sphere. of course
for k < ks  1, it coincides with ti. hence from now on, we can consider sd1
as an algebra,
generated by the ti. as before, it can be extended to u res

operator algebra acting on sd1

it only remains to prove that it is positive denite. for this, it is enough to check that
((t1)n, (t1)n) > 0 for all n < ks, using the invariance of ( , ) and unitarity of lres(n1) for

25

n < ks. this follows either by a continuity argument for q on the unit circle between 1 and
q using (4.2), or by a direct calculation, which is done in appendix c. there, the bound

real, selfadjoint position operators can be dened for example as ti + t

the fuzzy sphere [25] in the sense that there is a cuto in the set of representations of the
symmetry group, but we do not insist here that the algebra of functions should be a simple
matrix algebra; instead, we consider a larger algebra including  or uq.

proof using (2.12), one can see that for   lf in(p zimii),
(r1  f ) (r2  ) = q(f ,z)f  
where f is the weight of f and z = p zimii; this is because the term pu +res

the more explicit formulas in [20, 19]. on adsd1

this completes the denition of the staralgebra of coordinate functions on the real

i , and

q

q

27

together with uq we have a complete framework for quantum mechanics on the qdeformed
ads space.
it should be noticed that the operators ti satisfy the algebra (2.19) on all f (n) except
the one with maximal n. this is related to the classical issue of the domain of denition
of the position operators on ads space, which are then unbounded operators, and can be
obtained as the limit of ti for q  1. then the maximal f (n) becomes the lowest
weight module with minimal mass, and could be called the massless eld (even though
the denition of massless is somewhat ambiguous on the ads space). in the classical case,
the product of this eld with the coordinate function ti is not in the hilbert space any more,
and one might simply say that this eld is not in the domain of denition of the position
operator. however this domain can be extended, and the denition (5.36) of the operator
ti amounts to an extension such that (5.59) still holds, at the expense of the commutation
relations. hence we enter the nontrivial subject of extensions of the domain of denition
of symmetric operators. this shows that even issues of operator analysis can be addressed
in our regularized, nitedimensional version, which might be of interest even from the
purely classical point of view.

6 further developments

6.1 calculus

it is wellknown that there exists a qanalogue of the usual dierential calculus, dierential
forms etc. on the quantum euclidean space; for an extensive review see e.g.
[9]. even
though this is usually done for generic q, there is no problem extending it to roots of unity.
moreover, the reality structures dened in section 5 immediately generalize to these algebras.
the basic relations are as follows [39]:

with

the oneforms dxi satisfy

ixj = gij + q( r1)kl

(p )ij

the dierential forms that should be used on the sphere or antide sitter space are 1

all this is covariant under the symmetry algebra u res
r dxi,
where r2 = x2. however, the number of independent oneforms remains d instead of d  1,

.

q

28

since d(x2) cannot be omitted (i.e.
factored out) consistently. this may in fact be quite
interesting from a physical point of view, see section 6.3. from a formal point of view, this
is related to the fact that there exists a certain analog of the diracoperator in the sense of
connes,

(q1 + 1)r2 d(r2)
which generates the calculus on these quantum spaces by

w =

q2
1

[w, f ] = (1  q1)df

(6.4)

(6.5)

for any form f with the appropriate grading. this was discovered by bruno zumino [41]. it
satises

(6.6)
it is also worth observing that d(x1)m1 = 0. one could go on and dene an analog of the
laplace operator by  = gijij, and write down wave equations. however at roots of unity,
this is perhaps a bit too simpleminded. a dierent proposal will be made in section 6.3.

dw = w2 = 0.

6.2

integral

the invariant integral of polynomial functions on the quantum sphere is uniquely given by
the projection on the invariant component (5.39), as in [34, 12, 9] for real q. to make the
notation more intuitive, we can write

f (t) =< f (t) >

(6.7)

q

is considered as the algebra generated by ti. one can give an explicit formula,
where sd1
using the calculus discussed in the previous section: consider the invariant linear functional
[34, 9] dened on m 2k
in the appendix, and the vertical bar means evaluation, i.e. it anihilates the derivatives.
we dene ck such that < x2g(x) >=< g(x) >, hence < > is a functional on sd1
. since
it is also invariant, it agrees with the unique integral,

k kf (x)| for k < ks, where ck is given by (11.21)

q by < f (x) >:= c1

(t1)m1td = td(t1)m1

i 6= 1, d

(the minus could be eliminated by dening i = qe
1 ti). similarly, one obtains commutation
relations between the other elements of f (m1) and the generators ti, and hence between the
elements of f (m1) themselves. this algebra is consistent with the action of u res
, which is
that of g as we have seen earlier. moreover, it is naturally a hilbert space as we have used
many times, hence the algebra generated by f (m1) is naturally a star algebra, using the
adjoint. the inner product can again be obtained from a unique invariant state. combining
this with sd1
becomes a staralgebra. the unique invariant
state denes an integral on a, so that the inner product (5.4) of this hilbert space can be
written in the form

6.3 towards formulating physical models

we have already discussed the oneparticle states for scalar particles in detail: they are just
the irreducible representations f (n) = lf in(n1)  adsd1
for m1  n < m1 + ks, or
equivalently the lowest weight modules lf in(k1) for (d  2)/2 < k  m1. the integer
k characterizes the mass of the particle, in the antide sitter sense. how it should be
determined is a dynamical question; one might e.g. write down lagrangians and try to
formulate a variational principle.
in particular, this would allow to consider interaction
terms, since functions on quantum antide sitter space can be multiplied. we will come
back to this in a moment.

q

spin one particles or vector elds are irreducible representations lf in(k1  1), where
k satises certain unitarity bounds. they can be described as oneforms on adsd1
, as
discussed in section 6.1. as we pointed out, there are now d components instead of d  1,

q

30

the additional one corresponding to radial forms f (t)dr. in the classical limit, they simply
become scalar elds on ads space, which are intimately connected to their vector partners.
in fact in the massless case, they turn out to be ghosts of the gauge elds. moreover, there is
a natural brst operator which arises from u res
[36, 35]. all these surprising features show
that the remarkable structures that arise at roots of unity may have very interesting physical
interpretations. we should also mention the classical symmetry g here, which appears to be
spontaneously broken in a natural way to su(2)r for d = 2r + 1, and to u(1)r for d = 2r
[37]. of course, elds with dierent spin can also be described.

q

q

however, the correct formulation of a dynamical principle on adsq is not clear, and
deserves some discussion. the traditional approach would be to write down a lagrangian,
which determines a hamiltonian, which in turn dictates the dynamics of a model. on
adsd1
however, the energy is given a priori; it is simply the element e of the cartan
subalgebra of uq(so(2, d  2)) dened in section 3.1. hence it seems that the dynamics
should be formulated here by a principle which determines the physical, onshell degrees
of freedom, as in string theory. this is quite trivial in a noninteracting model, since it
just amounts to picking an irreducible representation. in an interacting model, determining
a consistent physical hilbert space in terms of the representations we have at our disposal
seems very nontrivial. in particular, it involves tensor products of the oneparticle states,
which is a rather complicated and rich topic for quantum groups at roots of unity [5]. this
is also related to knot theory via the r matrix and the drinfeld casimir v (2.13), which
has proved to be very important in earlier sections. in view of this and other considerations,
we propose the following onshell condition:

v = 1

(6.13)

or perhaps v = c for a constant c, as an operator identity on the physical manyparticle
hilbert space, supplemented by other conditions. this is somewhat reminiscent of the on
shell condition in string theory, l0 = a (among others), see also [1]. it will be discussed
further in the next section.

in
nevertheless, there are obstacles if one tries to perform a second quantization.
particular, it is neither clear how to impose a symmetrization postulate on adsd1
, nor
how to dene an invariant pathintegral. consider manyparticle states, which should be
described by tensor products of the oneparticle irreducible representations lf in(k1). a
rst complication is that at roots of unity, such tensor products are generally not completely
reducible. however, there exists a reduced tensor product, which yields precisely the correct
physical manyparticle states, as a direct sum of unitary irreducible representations. this
was dened in the case of u f in
(so(2, 3)) in [38], and will be discussed more generally else-

q

q

31

where6. the more dicult problem is that there seems to be no natural denition of a totally
symmetric or antisymmetric tensor product for more than 2 factors, because the r matrix
represents (a quotient of) the braid group rather than the symmetric group. a related di-

culty arises in the context of path integrals: if one expands the elds as (t) =p a(k)f (k)(t)
in the usual way, then the coecients a(k) should be covariant under u f in
as well, hence
they cannot be ordinary numbers, and there is no obvious denition of an integral. some
new ideas are needed here, presumably related to the natural concepts of braiding, links
and vertices associated to the elds lf in(k1). a proposal in this direction has been given
recently in a somewhat dierent context [28], which is however not consistent with a hilbert
space formulation.

q

q

finally, we want to mention that it is easily possible to describe elds on covering spaces
of adsd1
. this is done by giving up the quantization of the eigenvalues of the energy e to
(half)integers, which arises from the compact timelike curves on antide sitter space. the
corresponding unitary representations of u f in
(so(2, d2)) with nonintegral weights indeed
exist [37]. however, u res
is then not admissible any more, which means that the classical
symmetry g disappears. the elds cannot be described simply by polynomials in the ti any
more, but they are still nitedimensional with similar properties.

7 discussion of physical aspects

some remarks on the physical aspects of the suggested framework are in order.

q

hilbert space first and foremost, the hilbert spaces of particles respectively elds on
adsd1
are nitedimensional, even though they are covariant under the noncompact sym-
metry algebra uq(so(2, d 2)). since all local aspects of such a theory should have a smooth
limit to the at, undeformed case, this can nevertheless be viewed as a regularization of the
classical, at case if one takes the limit r  . all states have manifestly positive energy,
with a highenergy cuto of the order of m1, in units where r = 1. moreover, there exists
only a nite number of inequivalent oneparticle representations.

the total number of states in adsd1

q

as dened in (5.7) can be calculated easily. for

simplicity we calculate

same should hold on adsd1

.

however, the physical interpretation of the cuto m1 is not entirely clear. at rst sight,
on may be tempted to relate lmin to the planck scale, even though we have not attempted
to formulate gravity here. on the other hand, the commutation relations (2.19) suggest the
existence of another, larger length scale, since they involve the scale l2
n c  r2i(q  q1) or
m 1, where one would expect the noncommutativity to become important. this
ln c/r 
implies a certain quantization of the radius r of ads space in terms of ln c and m. of course
this argument may be questioned because the coordinate functions ti are not real. however
this scale is relevant whenever functions on adsd1
are multiplied, for example if one would
write down interaction terms in lagrangians, as discussed in the previous section. we will
see further evidence for the importance of this scale in the next paragraph. hence ln c is
expected to be the relevant noncommutative scale where the fuzzyness of the space
becomes important, while m1/r is the maximal energy of the entire manyparticle hilbert
space. of course, these issues can only be settled once a physical model has been formulated
and studied. it is nevertheless quite interesting that in the context of loop quantum gravity
and spin networks [3], a similar quantization of the cosmological constant in terms of the
planck length and the root of unity of a quantum group was found.

q

at this point, we can get some insight into the proposed onshell condition v = 1 (6.13),
for the oneparticle sector. consider the unitary representations lf in() = lf in() for
 = 2m1   with lowest weight . it satises v = 1 if the classical casimir c is divisible by
2m, by (2.28). this holds in particular if c = 0, which is a good denition of massless elds
on ads space; for example, it means  = (d  2)1 for scalar elds. it also characterizes
certain gauge elds with higher spin [10], for example the massless vector elds on ads4
q ,
which contain the correct degrees of freedom of gauge elds [38]. this will be discussed in
more detail elsewhere; in any case, the constraint v = 1 yields certain massless elds, and
a series of massive elds with masses of the order of m , since c is quadratic in . the
latter is essentially l1
n c, the scale found above where noncommutative eects are expected
to become important. therefore one gets qualitatively a similar picture as in string theory.
however, the tower of massive elds terminates here.

antiparticles another interesting issue is the physical meaning of certain observables,
such as the operator e dened in section 3.1. for e much smaller than m1, this is clearly
the generalization of the classical energy. however, note that the spectrum (=the weights)
of the irreducible representations lf in((m1 + k)1) for k < m1 is symmetric around m11,
and there are as many states with e = 2m1  n as there are with e = n. hence one
could interpret [e]q1  m1
) as the physical energy which has a maximum at e = m1,
and interpret the states with e > m1 as antiparticle states. this is actually more natural
from the mathematical point of view. then particle and antiparticle states could be unied
in one irreducible representation, which is a fascinating picture. alternatively, one may
interpret lf in((m1 + k)1)  lres((m1 + k)1) as the anti-particle states corresponding to
lf in((m1 +k)1). then the operator  dened in (5.45) plays the role of a cp t operator. it
could also be redened using u(g) so that it leaves lf in((m1 + k)1) invariant, if one wants
to interpret the latter as containing both particle and antiparticle states as just discussed.

comments on the adscft correspondence recently, an interesting conjecture be-
tween string or m theory on adsnw and (super)conformal eld theories in n1 dimensions
has been proposed [26]. this includes the cases ads5  s5, ads3  s3  m, and ads4  s7.
moreover, this has been extended to certain quotients (orbifolds) sn/ [17], which can break
supersymmetry. even though no precise denition of the string theory or m theory side is
known, it has been argued that it implies a stringy exclusion principle [27], which may
indicate that the eective spacetime is noncommutative. one may try to identify m
with the number of dbranes, as was already suggested in the literature [13, 15]. hence it
is quite striking that the mere denition of quantized ads spaces at roots of unity presented
here leads naturally to such product spaces with spheres, as explained in section 5.2. in
particular, the appearance of ads4  s7
 was completely unexpected, and occurs without
making any choices. another feature of the adscft correspondence is the quantization of
the radius of ads space in terms of the planck scale and the number of dbranes [26]. we
found a similar quantization above, where the relevant integer is m.

one may object that there is no reason why precisely the drinfeldjimbo quantum groups
at roots of unity should play a role in the adscft correspondence. on the other hand, it
has been known for a long time [1] that they do play a role in certain conformal eld theories,
such as the wzw models. since the ads space can be viewed as a coset of the ads group,
it is plausible that the quantum ads group at roots of unity should be important in the
above context. hence it seems worthwhile to study the consequences of that assumption; as
we pointed out, they are quite striking and rich. however at present, it is dicult to study
these issues in more detail, since little is known about both the string theory side and the
quantum group side.

10 appendix b: on the weyl element 

we want to give some explanations to the remarkable formulas (5.14), (5.16) and (5.15).

to get some condence in these formulas, notice that if

() = r1  

(10.1)

holds on the tensor product of 2 fundamental representations, then it holds for any repre-
sentations. this can be seen inductively: if (10.1) holds on v  v , then it also holds on the
representations in v  v   v . indeed by coassociativity,

(id )() != r1

1,(23)(  )

36

(10.2)

acting on v (v   v ) should be the same as

( id)() != r1

(12),3(  )

(10.3)

acting on (v  v )  v . the rhs agree indeed since uq is quasitriangular, see e.g. lemma
1.1.1 in [35]; thus the lhs agree as they should. furthermore, since the action of  on
any given nitedimensional representation can be expressed in terms of generators of uq,
it satises () = r()r1, and together with (10.1) this implies () =   r21.
(10.1) also shows that  is well-dened at roots of unity; this can alternatively be seen from
the explicit formulas given e.g. in [21].

the action of  on the fundamental representations can be found explicitly, see [19]. if

they are real, it is essentially the invariant metric gij, by (5.26).

(5.16) together with the statement that  = 1 on any irreducible representation now
follows easily, since  := v12 is grouplike, i.e. () =  , and it only remains to check
that  is 1 on the fundamental representations, where it agrees with the classical limit.
finally, we show x1 = s(x). again, this can be veried for the fundamental
representations, and it follows for tensor product representations by (10.1) and the fact that
both sides of (5.15) are algebra maps.

11 appendix c: some proofs
proof of theorem 4.1 the fact that f (k) = lres(k1) = lf in(k1) have the same
character as classically for k as stated was already explained in the text; this can also be
seen to a large extent by considering various casimirs. it remains to show that they are
linearly independent at roots of unity, and that (4.7) holds. linear independence is clear: if
there were a nontrivial linear combination of vectors in the f (k) which is zero, then there
would exists a nontrivial submodule of the form f (k0)  (f (ki)) 6= 0. this would mean
that at least one f (k) contains a highest weight vector, which is in contradiction to f (k)
being irreducible (this also follows from wellknown facts about representations at roots of
unity [5]). now (4.7) follows immediately, because the characters and hence the dimensions
of the f (k) are the same as classically.
proof of lemma 5.1: assume that  acts trivially on . since lres() is a highest weight
module, every v  lres() can be written in the form v = u  w for u  u res
. dene
t  v := (u)  w. this is welldened, because t  (hi  w) = (hi)  w = hi  w by the
assumption. clearly t 2
 = 1, and if c is the matrix representing t, then c 2 = 1 and (5.24)
follow.

q

37

to see that lres() is real, observe that lres() contains a vector   w with weight
, since hi1 = (hi) and  acts trivially on . this implies (e.g. by the method of
characters) that for generic q, the representation lres()  lres() has precisely one trivial
component, which denes the invariant tensor. it can be viewed as a solution of the equations
x +
i = hi = 0 which are analytic in q. therefore this invariant tensor is smooth, and induces
an invariant tensor also at roots of unity, where the irreducible representation lres() can
be obtained as quotient of the generic ones. hence lres() is real. this can also be seen
from theorem 2.3.

next we prove (5.25). (5.23) implies

(u)t = b1((u))b

with b = ca, and applying this twice yields

(u) = (bt b1)(u)(bt b1)1,

(11.1)

(11.2)

using 2 = id. since the representation is irreducible, schurs lemma implies that bt b1 =
1, or equivalently bt = b for some   c. this is possible only for  = 1, thus

bt = b.

(11.3)

similarly, taking the complex conjugate of (11.1), we obtain

(u) = b1((u))b

= b1((u))t b = b1b1(u)bb,

(11.4)

using (5.6) and (u) = (u). on the other hand, (u) = (u), and it follows as above
that bb = 1. together with (11.3), this implies that bb = 1. the constant 
must be real and positive because bb is a positive denite matrix. we can assume that
the determinant of b (or g) has modulus one, hence

bb = 1.

(11.5)

decomposing b = x + iy with real matrices x, y , it follows that [x, y ] = 0. thus
x and y can be simultaneously (block)diagonalized with a real, orthogonal matrix o,
and b can be written in the form b = ot jo with j diagonal if bt = b, or j block

diagonal with blocks proportional to(cid:18) 0 1

0 (cid:19) if bt = b. changing the basis using the

matrix o yields (u)t = j 1((u))j while preserving (5.6), and j has the desired form

38

1

after a transformation with a unitary diagonal matrix. in particular, (5.25) together with
j t c = g() (see below (5.23)) implies that

g = j t c(1).

(11.6)
next, we show that j = 1 if the representation is orthogonal at q = 1, and j t = j if it
is symplectic. equation (5.21) holds also for u = , where () = 1 (this can be understood
e.g. from the explicit form [14] of  as a power series in u res
, or simply by the fact that 
acts trivially on trivial representations). using (5.14), this implies

q

(11.7)
since lres() is real, lres()  lres() contains precisely one trivial module for generic q, as
classically. in that case, it is known [30] that

l () = gkl

gij(r1)ij

mnm

k ()n

(11.8)

k ()n

nm = ij

gij(r1)ij

mn = gij( r1)ij

l () = gkl, and qcgnmm

nm = qcgnm
where c is the classical quadratic casimir. now for q = 1, ( r)ij
mn is the permutation
operator, hence  = 1 if l() is orthogonal at q = 1, and  = 1 if it is symplectic. in
any case, qcgnmm
n(1). now 1 = v1 by
n(), or g() = (g())t .
(5.16), and together with (2.28) we obtain gnmm
by (11.6), this implies jc = (jc)t . by denition, c leaves the subspace with weight 
invariant, where c = 1. hence j t = j, and the claim follows.
in particular, we have shown c t = jcj 1, which can also be seen by calculating ((u))t
in 2 dierent ways and using schurs lemma. finally, taking the adjoint of (5.24) yields
((u)) = ((u)) = c(u)c. on the other hand, ((u)) = c (u)c , and schurs
lemma implies that cc  = 1 for some   c. since c = 1 on the highest weight vector,
we obtain c  = c. 
(one can show similarly that there exists another basis such that the representation

k () = gkll
k () = gkll

satises both (5.6) and (u)t = j 1(u)j for u  {x
