abstract

in this paper, a new approach to string dynamics is proposed.
string coordinates are identied with a non-commuting set of opera-
tors familiar from free string quantization, and the dyanamics follows
from the virasoro algebra. there is a very large gauge group oper-
ating on the non-commuting coordinates. the gauge has to be xed
suitably to make contact with the standard string picture.

1. introduction

in the last couple of years, it has become clear that string theory has a very
rich structure, which was not apparent in its early formulation [1]. there has
been progress in several parallel and overlapping directions: various string
theories which were once considered distinct are now known to be related
by duality transformations [2], and new extended objects called branes were
shown to play an important role in string dynamics [3,4]. there is also the
interesting new idea of duality relating string theory in an ads background
to the conformal eld theory on the boundary of the ads space [5,6]. in view
of all of these developments, there is clearly a need for a new approach at a
fundamental level which can unify and explain all of these diverse aspects of
string theory. recently, such a unifying approach called m(atrix) theory has
been proposed [7,8], and it has already led to anumber of interesting results.
a natural idea that has been around for some time is to attribute the rich
structure of string theory to an as yet undiscovered gigantic gauge symme-
try. from this point of view, the gauge symmetries observed in the zero mass
sector, the dieomorphism invariance associated with the graviton, as well as
various dualities are the manifestations of this hidden symmetry. however,
the full structure of this conjectured gauge symmetry is yet to be discovered.
one reason why this symmetry is so dicult to unmask in the usual pertur-
bative formulation as well as in the string eld theory approach [9-12] is that
in these formulations, there is always a good deal of gauge xing to start with.
in most versions of string eld theory, the gauge xing is done either through
the brst method or by adopting the light cone gauge [13]. both the original
matrix theory and its compactied version, the matrix string theory [14,15]
operate again within the gauge xed lightcone framework. still missing is a
formulation in terms of a large number of mostly redundant coordinates and
a big gauge group. in such a formulation, various dierent descriptions of
string theory will correspond to dierent choices of gauge.

this paper is an attempt to answer two questions: what is this big gauge
gauge group and also what is the space it acts upon ? the sigma model[16-
20] description of the zero mass modes of the string should shed some light on
this problem. imposing conformal invariance on this model results in equa-
tions of motion which are explicitly invariant under the gauge symmetries
associated with the massless vector mesons and coordinate transformations
associated with gravity. however, the neglect of the heavy modes of the
string makes it impossible to go beyond these well known symmetries of the

1

low energy eld theory limit. there is a version [21,22] of the sigma model
which incorporates the heavy modes of the string, and conformal invariance
in this case is realized through the wilson renormalization group approach.
unfortunately, the gauge symmetries of the resulting equations are quite ob-
scure, probably because of the particular cuto used. in a modied version
[23] of this approach, invariance under a certain class of coordinate transfor-
mations can be made explicit, but this only scratches the surface: a large
number of symmetries are still hidden.

the basic idea of this paper is to formulate string dynamics in such a
way that coordinates and momenta appear on equal footing. by coordinates
and momenta we mean, not just the zero modes, but the full set of quantized
modes of, for example, the free string. we will essentially make use of a
phase space description, with a doubling of the coordinates. corresponding
to this enlarged coordinate space, there will an enlarged gauge group, which
will now include transformations that mix non-commuting variables. this
generalization is motivated by two observations: various generalized dual-
ity transformations [24] interchange coordinates and momenta, and if they
are to be part of the proposed gauge group, transformations that mix co-
ordinates and momenta should be included. in addition, the emergence of
non-commutative geometry [25-31] as a viable description of some aspects
of string theory has been very suggestive. in a sense, what we have here is
a generalization of non-commutative geometry to include not just the zero
modes, but all of the other modes of the string.

we need to specify a dynamical principle as the basis of our approach.
usually, the starting point is an action, which is required to be conformally
invariant. the stress tensor of this action then generates a conformal algebra.
we reverse this sequence of steps and start with the conformal algebra as the
basic principle. the generators of the conformal algebra are assumed to be
expressible in terms of the operators that generate the free string spectrum,
and the dynamical equations we are seeking follow the requirement that the
algebra close. an important bonus of this approach is that invariance under
a big gauge group that mixes non-commuting variables is naturally built into
the dynamical framework.

the paper is organized as follows:

in section 2, we will rst set up
the problem in general terms, and then discuss the perturbative expansion
around the at (free string) background. as usual, such a perturbative ex-
pansion seems the only way of making progress in solving the dynamics. this
enables one to linearize the equations as a rst approximation, and the rest

2

of the section will mostly deal with these linear equations. we will present
some special solutions to them based on the vertex construction, and we will
then introduce a representation of the operators in terms of states, which will
turn out to be useful for a general analysis of the equations. in section 3, we
will study the open string dynamics in some detail, with the idea of making
contact with the usual free string equations. we will be able to identify a
state, which, after some gauge xing, can be made to depend only on a set
of commuting coordinates, which can be identied with position coordinates
of the string. moreover, this state satises the standard free string equations
of motion. in the next section, these results are generalized to the closed
string. in section 5, we will go beyond the linear approximation and turn
our attention to the interaction term. a convenient expression for this term
will be given in terms of coherent state representation. finally, in section 6,
the basic equations will be reformulated using the brst formalism.
2. the general setup

as explained in the introduction, our goal is to derive the dyanamics of

the bosonic string by constructing representations of the virasoro algebra

[lm, ln] = (m  n)lm+n + c(m3  m)m+n,

(1)

where c is the central charge. in the case of the closed string, we have to work
with two commuting copies of this algebra. any conformally invariant two
dimensional theory will supply a realization of this algebra; the best known
special case is the free eld realization in terms of the operators 
m,

l(0)

m =

1
2



x



mn
n.

(2)

the s satisfy the commutation relations

[

m, 

n] = m m+n.

we wish to generalize the free eld realization to an interacting one, still
using the same set of operators. the most general expression for the lms
can somewhat symbolically be written in the form

lm = xi

(x)(i)

m (: y  :)i.

(3)

in this equation, x is the position coordinate and the s are the wavefunc-
tions corresponding to various levels of the string. the sum goes over all

3

of the possible products of s, normal ordered to avoid possible singular
expressions.
imposing the commutation relations of eq.(1) on this ansatz
will result in a set of equations for the s, which we can identify as string
eld equations. these equations are easy to write down; but solving them
is another matter. the only practical method seems to be a perturbation
expansion around a background, which is an explicitly known solution of the
same algebra. therefore, although the equations are background indepen-
dent, the perturbative solution will depend on the background. in this paper,
we will expand the ls around the free eld solution of eq.(2), corresponding
to a at background. setting

gives

lm = l(0)

m + km,

[l(0)

m , kn]  [l(0)

n , km] + [km, kn]  (m  n)km+n = 0.

(4)

here we have assumed that the central charges of l(0)s and ls are the same.
in the next section, we will investigate systematically the linear part of

this equation, dropping the last term quadratic in the ks:

[l(0)

m , kn]  [l(0)

n , km]  (m  n)km+n = 0.

(5)

eq.(5) is similar to the equation of motion of a non-abelian chern-simons
gauge theory, with the dierence that ordinary commuting coordinate deriva-
tives are replaced by the non-commuting operators l(0)
m . an important prop-
erty it shares with that theory is invariance under the transformations

lm  u 1lmu,

(6)

where u is an arbitrary unitary operator constructed out of x and the s.
these transformations can be identied with gauge transformations under
which the dynamics is invariant. they will play an important role in what
follows.

the linearized equations are invariant under the abelian part of the gauge

transformations:

km  km + [lm, h].

(7)

as usual, solutions related by gauge transformations will be considered equiv-
alent.

in the case of closed strings, in addition to l(0)s, we have l(0)s, which
have an expansion analogous to eq.(2) in terms of the s, and there is also

4

the corresponding ks. so in addition to eq.(4), there is an identical equation
for the variables with tildes, and also an equation that expresses the condition
that ls commute with ls:

[l(0)

m , kn]  [ l(0)

n , km] + [km, kn] = 0.

(8)

it is easy to nd special solutions to eq.(5) through the standard vertex
construction. the vertex operator, given by

v (k,  ) =: exp (ik.x( )) :

(9)

where

x ( ) = x +  

0 + i



x1

satises the relation[ref]

1

m (cid:16)eim 

m  eim 

m(cid:17) ,

[l(0)

m , v (k,  )] = i eim d
d

(v (k,  )) +

1
2

m k2eim v (k,  ).

(10)

as a result, we can set the ks equal to the vertex for tachyon emission:

km = eim v (k,  ),

(11)

with the condition

k2 = 2,

and eq.(5) is satised for any  and any k that satises the tachyon mass
shell condition. furthermore, this solution is abelian; dierent ks commute,
and as a result, it satises the initial exact equation (4). we also note that
dierent values of the parameter  correspond to gauge equivalent results,
since

(cid:20)lm,z 2

1

d v (k,  )(cid:21) = i(cid:16)eim2 v (k, 2)  eim1 v (k, 1)(cid:17) .

(12)

one can easily construct an innite number of additional solutions for the
ks by replacing the tachyon emision vertex by the emission vertices for the
higher excited states.

the solution given above also generalizes to the closed string. in this case,
we have two commuting set of operators, s and s, and two commuting
set of virasoro algebras generated by the ls and ls. let v denote the

5

vertex operator of eq.(8), constructed from s instead of s. then, the
corresponding ks and ks are given by

km = z 2
km = z 2

0

0

d eim( ) v (k,   )v (k,  + ),

d eim( +) v (k,   )v (k,  + ),

(13)

with

k2 = 2.

in this case, the solution only satises the linearized equations. again, ver-
tices for the emission of excited states provide additional solutions.

we now wish to analyze the linear equations for the ks in general, using
the operator expansion of eq.(3). we found it more convenient to carry
out this analysis in what amounts to a phase space representation of the
operators.
in this representattion, a one to one correspondonce is set up
between the normal ordered operator products and a set of states. the states
are constructed by the following procedure: first, a new set of operators,

m, which commute with the s, are introduced, as well as a new c-number
momentum p, which commutes with x. next, the old non-commuting set of
operators are replaced by a new set of commuting operators according to the
recipe

km  |mi, m  m, m  m, 0 = i  p,

where m > 0. finally, the application of the resulting operator on the vacuum
gives the state which is associated with the original operator. for example,
the normal ordered operator product

(x) 

0 

m 

n

corresponds to the state

(x) p  

m 

n|0i.

according to our denition of the normal product, the operators 
are always placed to the right of (x).

0 = i

we shall need the expressions for l(0)

m s acting on these states. we start
with a general normal ordered operator product, and we compute its com-
mutator with l(0)
m given by eq.(2). the original operator product, as well

6

as the nal commutator, can be represented by states, as explained above.
we therefore have a mapping from one set of states to another induced by
l(0)
m s, and this mapping provides us with a representation dierent from
eq.(2) for the l(0)s. we will call it the state representation for the l(0)s
and designate them by the same symbol as before when no confusion can
arise. it is straightforward to compute the explicit expressions for l(0)s in
this new representation; however, as they stand, these expressions are a bit
complicated. they can be simplied considerably by making an additional
canonical transformation

m  m  m, m  m  m,

where m > 0. to avoid complicating the notation, we will use the same
letters for the new set of operators, it being understood that, from now on,
s and s will stand for the new set of operators. finally, we have the
following simple result:

l(0)

m  l

m  l

m,

(14)

where l is given by eq.(2) and l has an identical expansions in terms of
the s. the only change is in the denition of the zero modes; they are now
given by


0 = p   i, 

0 = p .

(15)

the lack of symmetry between the zero modes is due to our particular nor-
mal ordering prescription for the operators x and i discussed earlier. we
also note that the l(0)s dened by eq.(14) have no central charge. this is
to be expected, since the action of l(0)s on the states is dened by their
commutators with the corresponding operators, and the central charge drops
out of the picture since it commutes with everything.

the linearized equations(eq.(5)), in this new language, are

(cid:16)l
m  l

m(cid:17) |ni (cid:16)l

n  l

n(cid:17) |mi  (m  n)|m + ni = 0,

(16)

where the state |mi has replaced the operator km. in the language of these
new states, hermiticity properties of the original operator products are a bit
complicated. hermitian conjugation of the operator product corresponds to
the following interchange of the corresponding states:

m  m,   ,

|mi  |  mi, p  p  i.

(17)

7

3. solutions to the linear equations for the open string

in this section, we will investigate the linearized equations for the open
string (eqn.(5) ), and connect the solutions with the well-known states of the
free bosonic string. at rst sight, it seems that we have both too many states
and too many independent variables. instead of a single string state, there
are innitely many of them labeled by an integer m. also, the number of
coordinates are doubled compared to the standard string picture. the states
are now constructed using two new sets of operators: s in addition to the
s, p in addition to x. on the other hand, there are also a large set of gauge
transformations given by eq.(7), which translate into

|mi  |mi +(cid:16)l

m  l

m(cid:17) |gi,

(18)

where |gi represents an arbitrary gauge state. as we shall show, equiva-
lence under these gauge transformations will drastically reduce the number
of independent states; only the state with m = 1 will turn out to be inde-
pendent. also, this state will be a function of only the s and x, and not
of the s and p . this reduction from the original set of non-commuting
coordinates to a nal set of commuting coordinates will be accomplished by
a (partial) gauge xing. to see this, let us organize the states as follows:
consider an expansion of the states in powers of p, and label each term in
the expansion by np, the number of factors of p it contains.
in addition,
we label them by the level numbers n and n; they are respectively the
eigenvalues of the operators

and

n =

n =



x1



x1

mm,

mm.

a given state |mi can therefore be written as a sum:

|mi = xnp,n,n

|m, n, n, npi.

(19)

we note that all of the ns are non-negative integers. also, it is easy to show
that the dierence n  n is the same for each term of this expansion.

8

we now focus on the state with m = 1. in principle, we could have
started with any other value of m, but it turns out that this particular value
of m has special properties that makes it easy to work with. we wish to
establish the following two results:
a) in the expansion of this state, all of the terms with either np or n greater
than zero can be gauged away.
b) after xing gauge, the complete solution to eq.(16) can be expressed in
terms of the single remaining component of |  1i, namely |  1, n, 0, 0i.
this state, which depends only x and the s, can be identied with usual
string state. furthermore, we will show that it satises the correct mass shell
equation and the subsidiary conditions.
since we are contemplating an expansion in powers of p, it is convenient to
seperate the ls into two parts; one of them linear in p and the other p
independent:

l

m = l

m(0) + p.m, l

m = l

m(0) + p.m.

the condition for a state |  1, n, n, npi to be spurious (pure gauge) follows
from eq.(18). if gauge states |g, n, n, npi, satisfying the equation

1 (0)|g, n, n + 1, npi = |  1, n, n, npi + l

l
+p.1|g, n  1, n, np  1i + p.1|g, n, n + 1, np  1i,

1(0)|g, n  1, n, npi

(20)

can be found, then this state is spurious. we wish to show that this equation
has solutions for states with either or both n and np greater than or equal to
1. the basic idea is to solve it by iteration, starting with the smallest values
of n and np and working up to larger values. the gauge states corresponding
to the smallest value of n, n = 0, are not determined by the above equation,
and we set them equal to zero for simplicity. starting with n = 0, we note
that this is a special case, since the left hand side of eq.(20) vanishes:

l

1 (0)|n = 1i = 0.

(21)

in this case, we can solve for the gauge state |g, n, 1, npi by inverting the
operator p.1:

|g, n, 1, npi = 

1

(np + 1)!

1.


p

(|  1, n, 0, np + 1i) .

(22)

9

this shows that all of the m = 1 states with n = 0 and np  1 can be
gauged away. now let us consider the next set of states at n = 2. in this
case, we can write

|g, n, n + 1, npi = (cid:16)l
+p.1|g, n  1, n, np  1i + p.1|g, n, n + 1, np  1i(cid:17).

1 (0)(cid:17)1(cid:16)|  1, n, n, npi + l

1(0)|g, n  1, n, npi

(23)

we note that the states on the right hand side of this equation all have
n  1, and acting on these states, the operator l
1 (0) is invertible. this is
in contrast to the previous case when, acting on states with n = 0, l
1 (0)
was not invertible, and that is why eq.(20) for n = 1 had to be treated as a
special case. now taking n = 1 and np = 0 in eq.(23), the right hand side
of the equation is completely known. this is because the gauge states with
n = 1 are already known (eq.(22)), and the last term on the right hand
side vanishes since there is no state with np = 1. the left hand side of
this equation then gives us all of the gauge states with n = 2 and np = 0.
now take np = 1 with again n = 1; again the right hand side is completely
known, and recycling the equation once more gives us the gauge states with
n = 2 and np = 1. continuing this iteration, all of the gauge states with
n = 2 and arbitrary np are determined. next we set n = 2 in eq.(23) and
continue the double iteration process till the gauge states for all of the values
of n and np are determined. this argument establishes the result that all of
the states |  1, n, n, npi with either of or both n,np greater than or equal
to 1 can be gauged away.

having shown that the only surviving piece of the state with m = 1 has
n = 0 and np = 0, we now derive the equation satised by this state. first
setting n = 1, and m  0 in eq.(16), and then projecting out the n = 0,
np = 0 component, we have

l
m(0)|  1, n + m, 0, 0i  l
(m + 1)|m  1, n, 0, 0i = 0.

1(0)|m, n  1, 0, 0i

(24)

notice that l
into n = 0 sector, and neither does l
the special case m = 0 in the above equation:

m(0) does not contribute for m  0 because of the projection
1 (0) because of the eq.(21). consider

(l

0 (0)  1) |  1, n, 0, 0i  l

1(0)|0, n  1, 0, 0i = 0.

(25)

10

we now argue that the state |0, n  1, 0, 0i can be gauged away. under
gauge transformations,

|0, n, 0, 0i  |0, n, 0, 0i + l

0 (0)|g, n, 0, 0i.

the operator l
0 (0) is always invertible, since it contains a term of the form
2
0 = 2, which can always be inverted. therefore, a suitable gauge state
can always be chosen to make the last term in eq.(25) vanish. with this
gauge choice, we have the standard mass shell condition:

(l

0 (0)  1) |  1, n, 0, 0i = 0.

(26)

it is important to notice that the choice m = 1 for the state in question
was crucial in arriving at the mass shell condition given above. with any
other choice of m, there would be extra terms in the corresponding equation;
for example, the analogue of eq. (22) for m = 2,

l

2 (0)|n = 2i = 0

is simply not true. it is possible to go beyond the mass shell condition and
establish the standard subsidiary conditions

l

m(0)|  1, n, 0, 0i = 0, m  1,

(27)

by showing that the states |m, n, 0, 0i for m  1 can all be gauged away.
this can be done, for example, by an adaptation of the standard string theory
argument[1].

having established that the state |1, n, 0, 0i can be made to satisfy the
standard string equations (eqs.(26) and (27)), the next step is to show that,
with further gauge xing, all of the other states, up to gauge equivalence,
can be determined in terms of this single state. in section (6), this will be
shown using the brst method; here, to illustrate how this process works in
a simple example, we will construct an explicit solution for the states with
n = 1 and np = 0 for m  0. we take n = 1, m  0 in eq.(16), and
project out the component corresponding to n = 0 and np = 1:

m(0)|  1, n + m, 0, 1i  l

l
+p.m |  1, n + m, 0, 0i + p.1 |m, n, 1, 0i = 0.

1(0)|m, n  1, 0, 1i  (m + 1)|m  1, n, 0, 1i
(28)

11

in this equation, the state |  1, n + m, 0, 1i vanishes by the previous gauge
choice. the following ansatz provides a solution;

|m, n, 0, 1i = 0, m  0,
|0, n, 1, 0i = i1. |  1, n, 0, 0i,
|m, n, 1, 0i = 1.m|  1, n + m, 0, 0i m  1.

(29)

there is a consistency check: the solution given above should also satisfy
the n = 1,np = 0 component of eq.(16) for m, n  0,

m(0)|n, n + m, 1, 0i  l

l
m,0|n, n, 1, 0i + n,0|m, n, 1, 0i = 0,

n(0)|m, n + n, 10i  (m  n)|m + n, n, 1, 0i
(30)

and indeed it does. in principle, solutions for higher values of n and np,
as well as for the negative values of m can be constructed in this fashion,
although this brute force method soon becomes too laborious.

we close this section with some further comments on gauge invariance.
starting with a very rich gauge group (eq.(18)), a good deal of gauge xing
had to be done to arrive at the string equations (26) and (27) for |1, n, 0, 0i,
our candidate for the physical string state. there is, however, still invariance
under the residual gauge transformations

|  1, n, 0, 0i  |  1, n, 0, 0i + l

1(0)|g, n  1, 0, 0i,

(31)

where the gauge state satises

l

0 (0)|g, n  1, 0, 0i = 0.

this is the well-known invariance under the shift by zero norm states gen-
erated by l1, and it is valid in any dimension. what is misssing is the
invariance under shifts by zero norm states generated by lms for m > 1,
which is only valid in the critical dimension. this is a really troublesome
puzzle, and we have only the following tentative suggestion for a solution. it
is possible that the choice of the state with m = 1, and n = np = 0 for
the physical string state, although it has the advantage of simplifying vari-
ous computations, is not suitable for fully understanding the residual gauge
invariance. for example, the the choice of the state

|s, n, 0, 0i =

n

xm=1

12

|m, n, 0, 0i,

(32)

for the physical state has the advantage that, under gauge transformations,

|s, n, 0, 0i  |s, n, 0, 0i +

n

xm=1

l

m(0)|g, n  m, 0, 0i,

(33)

the gauge states are generated by all of the lms, not just by l1. however,
we have found states of this type dicult to work with and we will not pursue
this point any further.

4.solutions to the linear equations for the closed string

in this section, we will briey discuss the solutions to the linear closed
string equations. our treatment will be less complete compared to the case
of the open string. the operators km and km are then replaced by the
states |mi and | mi. there are now two copies of the equation (16), plus an
equation expressing the commutativity of the two virasoro algebras (eq.(8)):

l(0)
m |ni  l(0)
l(0)

our discussion of the closed string states will more brief and less complete
compared to the open string. as in the last section, we expand the states in
powers of p and level numbers n, n, and now, in addition, in level numbers
n  and n . the states are thus labeled as

|m, n, n, n , n , npi,

| m, n, n, n , n , npi.

the usual constraint between the right-left level numbers requires that

n  n = n   n .

(38)

13

we have now to make a choice for the physical string state. in parallel with
the open string, we will focus on the states with m = 1 and set

|  1, n, 0, n , 1, 0i = i 1. |s, n, 0, n , 0, 0i,

(39)

where n = n  and the state

|s, n, 0, n , 0, 0i

is identied with the string state. there is, of course, some arbitrariness in
this choice, for example, the reason for having the operator i 1. on the
right is not yet clear. also, this choice is not symmetric between left and
right moving (tilde and non-tilde) states. we hope to clarify these issues as
we proceed.

we have to show that the state dened above satises two sets of equa-
tions; one set invoving the ls and the other set ls. the rst set of equations
are easy to derive. starting with eqn.(34), and following the same steps as
in the last section, one arrives at the analogues of eqns.(26) and (27):

(l

0 (0)  1) |s, n, 0, n , 0, 0i = 0,

l

m(0)|s, n, 0, n , 0, 0i = 0, m  1.

(40)

we now turn our attention to eqs.(35) and (36). in particular, eq.(36) im-
poses stringent conditions on the choice of the string state. take m = n = 1
and set np = 0 in this equation:

l(0)
1(0)|m = 1, np = 0i = l(0)

1(0)| m = 1, np = 0i.

(41)

for a non-trivial solution, both sides of this equation must vanish; other-
wise, the operators l1(0) and l1(0) would be invertible and the resulting
solution would be a pure gauge. we therefore set

l1(0)|  1, np = 0i = (cid:18)l 


1(0)  l

1 (0)(cid:19) |  1, np = 0i = 0.

(42)

to satisfy this condition, we write this state as a sum over n ,

|  1, n , np = 0i,

|  1, np = 0i =



xn =1

14

and identify the term with n  = 1 with the state dened by eq.(39). we
then have the following solution:

|  1, np = 0i =



xk=0(cid:18)l



1 (0)(cid:19)k

1(0)(cid:17)k
(cid:16)l 

(i 1.)|s, n, 0, n , 0, 0i.

(43)


we note that the operator l
1 (0) is invertible on states with n   1, and
therefore each term on the right hand side of the above equation is well
dened. this is one of the reasons for the presence of the operator 1 in the
denition of the state given by eq.(39); as a result, the sum in the equation
above starts at n  = 1.

next, we take n = 1 and m  0 in eq.(36):

lm(0)|n = 1, np = 0i = l1(0)| m = m, np = 0i m  0.

again, unless both sides vanish, the candidate for the string state would be
a pure gauge. we must therefore have


m(0)  l

(cid:18)l 

m(0)(cid:19) |  1, np = 0i = 0, m  0.

now project into the n  = 0 sector in this equation. because of this projec-

m(0) does not contribute for m > 0, and at m = 0, and
tion, the operator l
acting on the state dened by eq.(39), it gives one. the resulting equations
complement eqns.(40):

(cid:16)l 
0 (0)  1(cid:17) |s, n, 0, n , 0, 0i = 0,

l 

m(0)|s, n, 0, n , 0, 0i = 0, m  1.

(44)

another reason for having 1 in eq.(39) is that it gives the correct mass
shell condition in the above equation. 3

as an application of the formalism developed here, we note note that
t duality, under which the left moving(tilde) components are multiplied by
-1, is easily implemented by a transformation of the form given by eq.(6).
similarly, we hope that various other dualities can be implemented by gauge
transformations of the same type. an important point is that although these

3 our normalization of the slope parameter for the closed string diers by a factor of

two from the conventional one.

15

symmetries are usually quite transparent in the original non-gauge xed form
of the string equations, they are dicult to see in the gauge xed form of the
equations.

5. the interaction term

so far, we have considered only the linearized equations. our task in this
section is to express the non-linear interaction term in eq.(4) in the language
of states. for this purpose, it is very convenient to use a coherent state
representation for the states:

|f i = z du dv fm(u, v) exp  
x1
 exp iu0.x + iv0.p +



x1

1
k

mm!

(umm + vmm)! |0i.

(45)

the states are constructed from the operators m, m and p described in
section (1), but they are now labeled by f (u, v), a functional of variables u
m
and v
m. let the states representing km and kn be labeled by fm and fn,
and the state representing [km, kn] by f(m,n). the commutator [km, kn] is
easily calculated using the coherent state representation. the result is

f(m,n)(u, v) = z dudv z dudv fm(u, v )fn(u, v )yi
k!  exp v 
yj

j  vj) exp iv

0 .u

(v 



kv 

(u

i + u

i  ui)

k .u

it is convenient to dene a star product [11] of the states labeled by fm and
fn to be the state labeled by f(m,n),

|fmi  |fni = |f(m,n)i,

where f(m,n) is given by eq.(46). the star product dened in this way is
non-commutative but associative. eq.(4) can now be cast into the form

l(0)

m |fni  l(0)

n |fmi  (m  n)|fmi  |fni = 0.

(47)

so far, we have considered the open string. however, it is straightforward to
generalize everything we have done to the closed string by simply doubling
the number of operators.

16

we have seen that the virasoro algebra naturally gives rise to an in-
teraction term. the next question is whether it agrees with the standard
string interaction. it seems quite plausible that the standard string interac-
tion should provide at least one particular solution to our equations, since
it is highly unlikely that standard string theory is eliminated by imposing
virasoro invariance. of course, the existence of additional solutions cannot
a priori be ruled out. one way to attack this problem is to gauge x to the
light cone gauge and to compute the interaction term in that gauge. we
hope to return to this problem in the future.

6. the brst formulation

an elegant and convenient way of handling a theory invariant under a
gauge symmetry is the brst method, which has been extensively used in
the various formulations of the string theory [11]. here, we will rst show
how to reformulate the linear equations for the open string (eq.(16)) as the
nilpotency condition for the brst operator, and then we will generalize
to include the interaction term. the standard brst operator for the free
virasoro algebra is given by,

q =



x

l(0)

m cm 

1
2



x

(m  n)cmcnbm+n,

(48)

where l(0)
tion relations:

m is given by eq.(2), and bs and cs satisfy the usual anticommuta-

we know that q is nilpotent at the critical dimension:

{cm, bn} = m,n.

q2 = 0.

next, we wish to determine the form of q in the state representation. this
can be done directly by essentially going through the steps that led to eq.(14).
in the present case, we start with normal ordered operator products con-
structed out of bs and cs in addition to the s, and represent these opera-
tors by states as in section (2). to do this, we have to introduce the operators
 as before, and also we need two sets of addditional anticommuting opera-
tors, bm and cm, which are partners of the bs and the cs. next we compute
the anticommutator of q with the operator product. this anticommutator
induces a mapping from the initial set of states to the set of states represent-
ing the anticommutator, which then provides the state representation for q.

17

this procedure, although straightforward, gives a complicated and unwieldy
result . instead, we will try and guess a simple and economical form for q,
and afterwards check that the equation

q|si = 0

(49)

correctly reproduces eq.(16).

our guess for the state representation for q is the following: we will
keep eq.(48) as it stands, but the l(0)
m s of eq.(2) will be replaced by those of
eq.(14). also, our choice of the vacuum will be dierent from the usual one.
the standard vacuum is dened so that it is annihilated by all cm and bm for
m  1. instead, our vacuum will satisfy

bm|0i = 0,

for all m, and no other conditions. in particular, none of the cs annihilate
the vacuum. it is important to check whether the nilpotency condition

q2 = 0

is satised. generically, this condition is violated by the central charge of the
virasoro algebra. only in the critical dimension, the central charge of the
virasoro generators for the matter elds cancel against the central charge
of the virasoro generators for the ghost elds.
in the present case, the
generators for the matter elds, given by eq.(14), have zero central charge.
on the other hand, it is easy to verify that, with our new denition of the
vacuum, the virasoro generators of the ghost sector also have no central
charge, and the nilpotency condition is still satised.

we will now briey discuss equation (49). at ghost number zero, there
are no solutions to this equation; in particular, the vacuum is no solution.
at ghost number 1, the state

|si =

ck|ki,



x

(50)

is a solution if and only if the states |ki satisfy eq.(16). as usual, the gauge
transformations (18) are generated by the brst transformations

|si  |si + q|gi,

18

where |gi has ghost number zero. it is now easy to incorporate the interaction
term; identifying the states |ki in eq.(50) with the coherent states of eq.(45),

we dene a star product of two states |si and |si by

|si  x ck|fki,

the equations with interaction(eq.(47)) can then be written as

|si  |si = x ck cl |fki  |f 

l i.

q|si + |si  |si = 0.

(51)

it is easy to see that this equation is consistent with the nilpotency of q.
after all, all we have done is to rewrite eq.(4) in a fancier language, and
q2 = 0 is equivalent to the jacobi identity for the ls.

the brst formalism makes it possible to simplify and streamline the
derivation results of the earlier sections, although we will not try to do it
here. we should also point out that there are some problems with the un-
conventional denition of the vacuum state we have adopted; for example,
the space of states dened in this fashion is not self dual and as a result,
the brst operator is not self adjoint. the alternative construction that we
have sketched following eq.(48) avoids this problem, but as we have already
mentioned, leads to a complicated expression.

as a nal comment, we would like to point out that so far, we have only
considered the equations of motion for the string states. however, given the
brst operator and the star product, it is not too dicult to construct an
action from which these equations follow. for example, proceeding as in
reference [11], one could try the action

i = hs|q|si + hs| (|si  |si) ,

(52)

where |si is now a general state of odd ghost number. we hope to return to
this problem in the future.

7. conclusions and future directions

the basic idea of this paper was to derive string dynamics from the real-
ization of the conformal algebra on a suitable operator space. the operator
space we have chosen is the familiar one that results from quantizing the at
space free eld background. by requiring the closure of the conformal alge-
bra, we have derived a set of dynamical equations for the string. the novelty

19

of this approach lies in the identication of the non-commuting operators
with string coordinates. this results in the enlargement of the coordinate
space; but in compensation, there is invariance under a large gauge group
given by eq.(6). to reach the standard picture of the string, one has to do
some suitable gauge xing.

there are many interesting questions left to answer. for example, can
one gain some insight into the non-pertubative symmetries of string theory
by exploiting the new gauge invariance? some other new avenues of explo-
ration are the introduction of fermions and supersymmetry, and non-trivial
backgrounds corresponding to various branes.
