abstract

we present a superspace formulation for super eightbrane theory
based on massive type iia supergravity in ten-dimensions. remarkably,
in addition to the 10-form supereld strength originally needed for su-
per eightbrane, we also need an over-ranked 11-form supereld strength
ha1a11 with identically vanishing purely bosonic component, in order to
satisfy all the bianchi identities. as a natural super p -brane formulation
for the 11-form supereld strength, we present a super ninebrane action
on 10-dimensional super-worldvolume invariant under a local fermionic
 -symmetry. we also show that we can formulate such a superspace with
an over-ranked supereld strength also in eleven-dimensions, and possi-
bly in other lower dimensions as well.

1. introduction

in 1995, a rst possible eective theory formulation [1] for super eightbrane [2] or dirichlet
eightbrane [3] based on massive type iia supergravity [4] was presented. the basic idea is to
start with the massive type iia supergravity in ten-dimensions (10d) [4], regarding the mass
parameter m as a scalar eld, and then perform a duality transformation into its 9-form
potential eld with 10-form eld strength as its hodge dual. this 9-form potential eld
is to be identied as the background supereld for the super eightbrane action. however,
the drawback of ref. [1] was that only bosonic terms were given with no fermionic partners,
which are indispensable as an eective supergravity theory.

although there appears to be a tremendous amount of support for the idea of the dirichlet
p -brane [3], it has been noticed by gates [5] that there has been no satisfactory superspace [6]
(nor component) level formulation accompanying such a 10-form component eld strength in
a manifestly supersymmetric manner. as a simple consideration reveals, there seems to be a
fundamental obstruction for accommodating the 10-form eld strength in superspace. to see
this, let us introduce the 10-form supereld strength na1a10 corresponding to the 10-form
component eld strength na1a10 for its 9-form potential ma1a9. the fundamental problem
seems to be the contradiction between the non-zero constancy of the bosonic component
na1a10, and the satisfaction of the bianchi identity (bi) for na1a10, that usually occur at
the n -bi with dimensionality d = 1 of the form (n)c1c9 +     0. this is because
is constant, then the supersymmetry transformation of the potential should
if na1a10
vanish up to gauge transformation:
qma1a9 = 0. now due to the general relationship
 n|c2c9 for a supersymmetry transformation q [6]
qmc1c9 = nc1c9 +(1/8!)c1|
we expect no such components as nc1c8. however, once this component is zero, there
seems no way to satisfy the above n -bi in superspace, keeping na1a10 as a non-zero
constant.

in this paper, we will nally overcome this diculty by introducing an over-ranked 11-
form supereld strength ha1a11, mixed up with the n -bi. such over-ranked supereld
strengths have been already considered in 1980 [7], but our 11-form supereld strength
is more unconventional, because it enters into another supereld strength na1a10
via
a generalized chern-simons term, as will be seen. we will also give a possible super
ninebrane action coupled to the 10-form potential supereld via a wess-zumino-novikov-
witten (wznw) term. as a by-product, we provide a superspace formulation with a 12-
form supereld strength for 11d supergravity [8][9]. finally, we also give conditions for
any possible supergravity theory with an over-ranked (d + 1) -form supereld strength in
d -dimensional space-time.

we start with listing up our bis that are crucial for our formulation. first of all, our
, am, bmn, amnp, , mm1m9, cm1m10),2 where the rst
component eld content is (em
six elds are the standard ones for type iia supergravity [10] or its massive generalization
[4][11], e.g., am, bmn and amnp
respectively have the eld strengths fmn, gmnp and
fmnpq, while mm1m9 and cm1m10 are new in our superspace formulation. in particular,
mm1m9 has the eld strength nm1m10, while cm1m10 has an identically vanishing
eld strength hm1m11  0 obviously in 10d. accordingly, our supereld strengths are
d, fab, gabc, fabcd, na1a10, ha1a11, where the rst three are the standard
tab
ones in type iia supergravity [10][12], or its massive generalization [4][11], while the last
two are peculiar to the superspace formulation for super eightbrane. especially, despite of
is the only
ha1a11  0, there are non-vanishing components hc1c9, while na1a10
non-zero components among na1a10, as will be seen in (2.10).

(2.9)

to comply with (2.4). here the last cn -term can be interpreted as a generalized chern-
simons term, because it is a product of a potential supereld ca1a10 and the supereld
strength n. also to be stressed is the importance of the constancy (2.8), which makes the
whole system work consistently.

even though our bis above look so simple, we emphasize that we have tried many other
options, such as introducing other supereld strengths, such as fa1a8 and/or fa1a6 dual
to fabcd, like the m-5-brane formulations [13][14]. even though we have also allowed
possible chern-simons terms for each of these bis, these supereld strengths never helped us
to solve the problem with the unwanted terms in the n -bi at d = 1, as has been mentioned
is the only
in the introduction. it seems that the introduction of the over-ranked ha1a11
solution to this problem, once na1a10 dual to a scalar supereld n = const. is introduced.
as is well-known, there can be innitely many sets of constraints in superspace satisfying
our bis. however, we choose in this paper the simplest set, which is sometimes called beta-
function favored constraints (bffc), drastically simplifying the  -function computation,
originally for n = 1 supergravity in 10d [15], and applied later to type iia supergravity
in [12]3. our result for superspace constraints is summarized as

we now briey describe some crucial points for the conrmation of bis at d  1. the
most crucial step is the introduction of the hn -term in (2.4). aa was already mentioned in
the introduction, if there were no such a term in (2.4), there would be no satisfaction of the
n -bi for the component (c1    c9) at d = 1. there are other simpler and less crucial
conrmations, such as the (c1    c10) -component of the h -bi (2.5), which has only one
d)g|c9c10d which does not seem to vanish by itself. however, multiplication

we mention some errors detected in various numerical coecients in ref. [12], which are
now corrected by our constraints above. the most crucial ones in [12] are for the f4 -term
. similar errors are found in the coecients for 2 -terms, in
in tb



 , t

, and  



in [12]. even though the 2 -terms are not
particular, the () -term is missing in tb
essential at the lowest order, they will aect many computations at the bilinear order terms
with a lot of inconsistency, such as n -terms described in the next section.




3. bis at d = 3/2 and fermionic supereld equations

we can perform a simple consistency check about our superspace formulation with the
modications with the n -supereld strength accompanied by the additional supereld
strength ha1a11 at d = 3/2. the most crucial test is the (c1    c10) -type n -bi,
which is shown to hold only under an = 0. another important conrmation is the
fermionic supereld equations, obtained from the (c, ) -type t -bi (2.6) at d = 3/2.
our fermionic supereld equations with the n -modications thus obtained are

and similar forms for the other chiral components. note that there is no n -term in (3.1a).
since n = const. = m 6= 0, the n -dependent terms in (3.1) are regarded as mass terms,
corresponding to the original component formulation [4].

there are several ways of getting these fermionic supereld equations, and they yield
 be the l.h.s. of (c, ) -component of the t -bi of (2.6). we
 
have performed the contractions (i) 
  0. the contraction (i) gives directly (3.1a), while (ii), (iii) and (iv) give
0, (iv) 
the consistent equations (3.1b) and (3.1c). this is one of the non-trivial consistency check in
our formulation, in particular with the new 11-form supereld strength. as a matter of fact,
there occur lots of highly non-trivial cancellations among all the unwanted terms, providing
good cross-checks for the whole system. relevantly, the n -terms in (3.1) are sensitive to
-terms in the constraints (2.10d), (2.10e) and
the numerical coecients of f4 and 
(2.10n). in fact, this led us to detect the errors in numerical coecients given in [12].

4. super ninebrane in 10d

the existence of the 11-form supereld strength ha1a11 strongly indicates the possible
super ninebrane formulation on 10d world-supervolume. we give here a brief description of
such a formulation, as a special case of more general super p -brane formulations [2].6

our ansatz for the total action of super ninebrane is

(4.3)

note that the dimension of our world-supervolume and that of the target 10d space-time
coincide. this further implies that  dened by (4.2b) is equal to the 11 -matrix for our
10d superspace:

(4.4)
6due to the lack of strong motivation, the (p + 1)-dimensional target space-time for super p-brane was

in order to simplify other computations, it is convenient to use the notation

an(a1an) .

(4.7)

the i matrices conveniently satisfy the cliord algebra {i, j} = +2gij. armed with
these relations, we can now easily verify the  -invariance of our action (4.1), by the aid of
other relations such as

i1i10i9i1 = +(9!)gi1 ,

(4.8)

which seems by now almost trivial. in fact, an intermediate stage of the variation of i10 looks

5. 12-form supereld strength in 11d

once we have understood this super ninebrane formulation in 10d with the peculiar 11-
form supereld strength, our natural question is whether such a feature is common to other
superspace formulations in other dimensions. the answer to this question seems armative,
and we rst give an explicit example for 11d supergravity [9][8].

8

mimicking our 10d result, we introduce two extra supereld strengths na1a11 and
d and fabcd in 11d [8]. now

whose details we skip here. as before, other independent components, such as hb1b11 are
all zero.

in the conrmation of bis at d  1, some crucial relations are needed. for example, the

(e1    e9) -type h -bi at d = 0 needs:

(f )(|

(f e1e9)

(if e1e9

(5.6)

another example is the (c1    c11) -type h -bi at d = 1 requiring

which is conrmed by its multiplication by c1c11:

(c1c8|

d)fd| c9c10c11  0 ,

c1c11(c1c8

because one of the indices c9, c10, c11 on fdc9c10c11 should be d, like eq. (2.13).

d)fdc9c10c11 =  i

c1c11c1c8

(5.7)

(5.8)

we have now seen that we can introduce extra supereld strengths even for 11d super-
gravity, contrary to common wisdom about its tight eld content. however, we also add
that our modication alters only the o-shell structure, with no essential couplings between
ns and the original physical elds, up to topological considerations. this is also expected
from the past trials of modifying the 11d supergravity [19].

9

we can further try to repeat the construction of super tenbrane action, following the
super ninebrane result in 10d. however, we soon notice an obstruction that the 11d analog of
 -matrix (4.2b) is reduced to an identity, due to the 11d  -matrix relation a1a11a1a11 =
+i(11!)i.

6. super (2k  1)-brane action in d = 2k

since we have seen how the super ninebrane formulation works in 10d, it is straight-
forward to generalize it to an arbitrary supergravity theory in even space-time dimensions
d = 2k. the starting point is to establish the superspace formulation with the d -form and
(d + 1) -form supereld strengths na1ad and ha1ad+1, with the bis:

supergravity itself, whose details depend on the dimensions. also depending on d is
the dottedness of the  -matrices, which is implicitly included in the underlined spinorial
indices here. these underlined indices also include any possible n  2 indices in some
(c)
dimensions such as d = 6 [20], where
are antisymmetric, so that additional
c = i(c)ij with an antisymmetric metric

ij. additionally, because of the contraction rules for spinorial indices, with or without
antisymmetric charge-conjugation matrices depending on d, equations in (6.3) (and also in
(6.8) below) are correct up to signatures. as before, all other independent components of
n or h -supereld strengths, such as hb1bd are zero.

it is straightforward to show how all the bis (6.1) and (6.2) at d = 0 can be satised
by (6.3). the most crucial identity is for h -bi at d = 0: when d = odd, the identity is

i  (a) (ab1bd2) = cab1bd2c (a) (c)  0 ,

(6.4)

10

with a constant c. this is because d1 is  -tensor times one  -matrix in odd dimensions.
while if d = even, then the identity is

i  (a) (ab1bd2d+1) = cab1bd2c (a) (c)  0 ,

(6.5)

for d+1 proportional to 01    d1. thus whether d is odd or even, the h -bi at
d = 0 is identically satised, due to the total antisymmetry of the  -tensor.

in order to satisfy d = 1/2 and d = 1 h -bis, we need two conditions, respectively

t(|
tc1|(|

h|)d1dd1 = 0 ,
h|)|c2cd = 0 .

(6.7)

in fact, our previous 11d case satises both of these: (6.6) trivially, and (6.7) by the algebraic
 depends on
identity (5.8). since the explicit structure of the components t
the supergravity theory in d -dimensions, we do not go into the details any more. as for
the n -bis, one at d = 1/2 is rather trivial, while the old problem at d = 1 does not
arise, thanks to the hn -term in (6.2).

if this superspace formulation up to now is the whole story without a super p -brane
action, the space-time dimensions can be both even and odd. however, as we have seen for
11d case, due to the triviality of the matrix  in d = odd, only d = even is allowed
for a super (d  1) -brane action with the fermionic  -symmetry. considering this, let us
give the ansatz for the super (2k  1)-brane action for d = 2k  10, as a generalization of
(4.1) - (4.5), or even as a special case of super p -brane [2]: our relevant equations are7

the last equality in (6.8c) is the crucial one, in our case with the same dimensionality both
for the super-worldvolume and the target space-time, under the embedding equation (6.8d).

once we have seen the existence of over-ranked supereld strengths in 11d, 10d and

(6.9)

in 11d can be the origin of the over-ranked 11-form ha1a11

connected by appropriate dimensional reductions. the essential point is that the 11-form
in 10d, and the same
na1a11
pattern seems to continue to lower dimensions d  9. since the m-theory is the underlying
non-perturbative theory in 11d [21][22], this result may well provide a new important link
or duality between m-theory and 10d superstring, or even with theories in d  12 [23][24]
which in turn provides the origin of ha1a12

in 11d itself.

7. concluding remarks

in this paper, we have presented a superspace formulation with the 10-form supereld
strength na1a10, as the most important foundation for super eightbrane theory [1] that has
not been performed in the past. we have found a remarkable fact that the over-ranked 11-
form supereld strength ha1a11 is the crucial key for the n -bi to be satised. the peculiar
feature of our superspace formulation is triple-fold: first, the rank 11 of ha1a11 exceeds the
space-time dimension 10. second, ha1a11 appears in the supereld strength na1a10 as
a generalized chern-simons term, associated with the hn -term in the n -bi (2.4). third,
the whole mechanism works, only when the scalar supereld n is constant: n = 0.
to our knowledge, there has been so far no such a superspace formulation with an over-
ranked supereld strength involved in a peculiar generalized chern-simons term. taking
also the advantage of the simplest structure of the bffc constraints [12], we have drastically
simplied our superspace computation.

we have also presented a super ninebrane action with 10d world-supervolume with
the wznw term, naturally expected from the presence of the 10-form potential super-
eld ca1a10. it seems now that the super ninebrane action is a natural result of super
eightbrane formulation itself. in the conventional p -brane context [2], there was no strong
motivation for over-ranked supereld strengths. especially, the possibility of super ninebrane
formulation in 10d, in which the dimensionality of the target space-time coincides that of
the super-worldvolume, was not seriously considered, ever since the rst super p -brane
formulation [2]. the recent development of super eightbrane [1][2] or dirichlet eightbrane
[3] gave a strong motivation of introducing such over-ranked supereld strengths. we also
mention that our ninebrane action with the  -symmetry may be regarded as a non-linear
realization of supersymmetry in 10d, similarly to the dirichlet brane action in [25].

12

as a by-product of our 10d result with an over-ranked supereld strength, we have also
conrmed that a 12-form supereld strength can be introduced also into 11d superspace.
as for the possibility of super tenbrane formulation in 11d, there seems to be an obstruction
about the matrix  [2], because its usual denition results in an identity matrix. despite
of this situation in 11d, our result for over-ranked supereld strength seems to have lots
of applications even to d  9. namely, whenever there is a massive supergravity in
d -dimensions, we rst introduce the d -form eld strength na1ad as a dual to a scalar
eld n replacing the mass parameter m. we then introduce an over-ranked supereld
in order to satisfy the n -bis by a generalized chern-simons term.
strength ha1ad+1
however, a super (d  1)-brane formulation does not seem to exist in d -dimensions for
d = odd, due to the property of cliord algebras forbidding as in 11d the non-trivial matrix
 needed for a  -symmetry.

another consequence of our result is that the apparently old-fashioned superspace ap-
proach [6] is still powerful to discover yet unknown features of super p -brane physics. this
is because we can not even construct super p -brane action [2] without establishing the
underlying superspace for backgrounds. accordingly, there seems to be no alternative way
other than introducing the over-ranked supereld strength ha1a11. moreover, such an
over-ranked eld strength does not enter the algebraic analysis of supersymmetries for m-
theory in terms of cliord algebra [22]. from these viewpoints, superspace formulation [6]
still maintains its usefulness for nding unexpected features in supergeometry, even nowa-
days. there seems no alternative quick way to avoid the struggles with tremendous amount
of the  -matrix algebra, as we have performed for the satisfaction of our bis.

our result is also suggestive of possible underlying supergravity theory in d  12 like
those in [24], as the origin of the over-ranked supereld strength in 10d. it is plausible that
higher-dimensional non-perturbative theories [23] which are supposed to underlie the 10d
or 11d theories, may well enter the conguration, when we start considering super p -brane
physics as the basis of non-perturbative description of superstrings or supermembranes.

considering that there has been no superspace formulation for super eightbrane or dirich-
let eightbrane in the past, we re-stress the importance of our result as the establishment of
supergeometry for super eightbrane [1] for the rst time. it is natural that our formulation,
due to its unconventional over-ranked supereld strength involved in a peculiar chern-simons
term, has been overlooked for such a long time since the rst component formulation eec-
tive theory of super eightbrane [1]. we expect more future developments related to our new
superspace formulation with over-ranked supereld strengths in higher (d  12) [24] as well
as lower (d  9) dimensional theories.
