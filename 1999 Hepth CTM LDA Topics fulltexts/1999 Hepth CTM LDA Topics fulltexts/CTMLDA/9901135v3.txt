abstract

the phase diagram for dp-branes in m-theory compactied on t 4, t 4/z2, t 5, and
t 6 is constructed. as for the lower-dimensional tori considered in our previous work
(hep-th/9810224), the black brane phase at high entropy connects onto matrix theory
at low entropy; we thus recover all known instances of matrix theory as consequences
of the maldacena conjecture. the diculties that arise for t 6 are reviewed. we also
analyze the d1-d5 system on t 5; we exhibit its relation to matrix models of m 5-
branes, and use spectral ow as a tool to investigate the dependence of the phase
structure on angular momentum.

introductory remarks

black hole thermodynamics has played an important role in elucidating the structure of
m-theory (see [1, 2, 3] for reviews). in the context of the maldacena conjecture [4, 5, 6],
black hole thermodynamics generates predictions for the thermodynamics of gauge theory
in various strong-coupling regimes. this conjecture posits (in its extended form) that all
of m-theory in spacetimes with particular asymptotic boundary conditions is equivalent
(dual) to a theory without gravity. recently [7], the present authors constructed a phase
diagram for maximally supersymmetric yang-mills theory (sym) on tori t p, p = 1, 2, 3,
by systematically exploiting these ideas. it was seen that a number of dierent geometrical
phases (i.e. those with a valid low-energy supergravity description as black objects) arise as
the entropy and coupling are varied 3. the boundaries of the region of geometrical phases
are correspondence curves [8] , where the curvature of the geometry becomes string scale at
the horizon of the object.

generically, the thermodynamics at high entropy contains a phase of black dp-branes,
while at low entropy one nds eleven-dimensional black holes in the light-cone (lc) frame.
the reason is quite simple [7]: the scaling limit specied by maldacena, and the limit pre-
scribed by sen and seiberg for compactications of matrix theory [9, 10], are one and the
same 4. one and the same gauge theory describe both; for example, on t p, black dp-branes
characterize the density of states in the regime of sym entropies s >
 n 2, whereas matrix
theory [13, 14] describes the regime s < n.

the point is that the scales of various features of the geometry, for instance proper size
of the torus and the string coupling, depend on radial position in the associated low-energy
black supergravity solution. since the horizon radius decreases with decreasing entropy, and
only the horizon geometry is relevant to the thermodynamics, the entropy parameterizes a
path through the moduli space of the low-energy supergravity. along this path, it may be
necessary to perform u-duality transformations to achieve a valid low-energy description of
the horizon geometry. this is why, at high entropy, the charge carried by the system is dp-
brane number; while at low entropy, it is interpreted as momentum. the two lie on an orbit
of the u-duality group ep(z). furthermore, phase transitions may occur in the geometrical
region due to (de)localization of the horizon on cycles across which it is initially (un)smeared

3the entropy is most useful in parameterizing the behavior of the theory since it is directly tied to the
horizon area of the low-energy supergravity solution. the energy can then be read from the equation of state
of the relevant black hole.

4it was shown that these two limits are related in [11, 12]. demonstrating their complete equivalence
requires further specifying the dimensionless quantities to be held xed, in particular the scale of the energy.

[15]. such transitions are involved in the passage from black dp-branes to matrix theory
black holes [16, 17, 18, 19].

thermodynamics is one of many probes of matrix/maldacena duality. it is a particu-
larly useful one in that it canonically associates an energy scale (that of a typical hawking
quantum) with a particular place in the geometry (the horizon). the fact that the geometry
appropriate to the description of this scale undergoes a sequence of duality transformations
as we go from ir (matrix theory regime) to uv (maldacena regime) means that the inter-
pretation of probes as scattering states in dlcq m-theory is only valid up to some scale,
beyond which one should pass to a description in terms of scattering o of black p-branes
in a dual geometry. using the relation between the energy and the radial scale probed [20],
this implies that matrix theory is only valid (in the sense of accurately describing at-space
supergravity) up to some distance from the source 5.

str  0, with the gauge coupling g2

the precise relation between the maldacena or near-horizon limit of n dp-branes on t p,
and matrix theory on t p with n units of longitudinal momentum, goes as follows [7]: the
maldacena limit is  = l 2
and the coordinate
size i/lstr of the torus cycles in string units held xed. this limit isolates the gauge theory
dynamics on the dp-brane while decoupling gravity (for p < 6). natural energy scales in
the gauge theory are measured with respect to the torus size 6. on the other hand, the
seiberg-sen prescription for matrix theory on t p [9, 10] involves iia string theory with n
d0-branes, or equivalently m-theory with n units of momentum on a circle of radius r11;
then one takes the limit lpl  0, with r11/l 2
pl and the (transverse) torus cycle sizes ri/lpl
held xed. the relation between the two sets of parameters is simply (c.f. [11, 12, 7]) the
t-duality on all cycles of t p that maps dp-branes to d0 branes and vice-versa:

y = gstr l (p3)/2

5this conclusion was independently reached from a somewhat dierent perspective in [21]. the analysis
of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (sqm) in this latter work is equivalent to the large v limit of the
phase diagrams here and in [7]. in section 2.4 of [7] it was observed that the d0 geometry breaks down at the
correspondence point, where the temperature of the system is t  n 1/3r11/l 2
pl. using the energy-distance
relations of [20], the result rmax  n 1/3lpl follows.
6for p 6= 3, the yang-mills coupling is dimensionful, and should be referred to the torus scale as well.
when we say that a dimensionful quantity is held xed in the decoupling limit, we mean the energy in the
system relative to that scale.

thus, the two limits are clearly identical.

in this work, we extend our analysis of such compactications to p = 4, 5, where the
relevant theories involve the dynamics of ve-branes [22, 23, 9, 10]; and p = 6, where the
denition of matrix theory is problematic [9, 10, 24, 25, 26]. in the process of generating
the phase diagram, we will rediscover all the remaining prescriptions for generating matrix
theory compactications; we will also comment on the diculties encountered for p = 6 (and
a proposal by kachru et.al. [27] for overcoming them). for p = 5, we map out the phase
diagram of the six-dimensional little string theories compactied on a ve-torus t 5.

in addition, we will analyze the phase diagram of the d1-d5 system, which arises in

diverse contexts:

 it has played a central role in our understanding of black hole thermodynamics [28];
 it is a prime example of the maldacena conjecture, due to the rich algebraic structure
of 1+1d superconformal theories which are proposed duals to string theory on ads3 
s3  m4 [4, 29, 30, 31];

 it describes the little string theory of vebranes [23, 32], where the little strings carry

both winding and momentum charges.

 it is related to the dlcq description of vebrane dynamics [33, 34, 35, 36].

the analysis will clarify the relation of the d-brane description of the system to one in
terms of ns vebranes and fundamental strings [31], as low-energy descriptions of dierent
regions of the phase diagram (for earlier work, see [37]). finally, we will explore the use of
spectral ow in the superconformal theory to determine the spectral density of the theory
as a function of angular momentum on s3.

1.2 phase diagrams for t 4, t 5, and t 6

as in [7], the phase diagrams for dp branes on tori, p = 4, 5, 6, have a number of common
features. the vertical axis of the diagrams will be entropy; for the horizontal axis we take
the size v of cycles on the torus t p in eleven dimensional planck units, as measured in the
lc m-theory appearing in the lower right corner (the phase of boosted 11d black holes).
n is the charge carried by the system: brane number in the high entropy regimes and
longitudinal momentum in the low-energy, lc m-theory phase. throughout the various
phases, the corresponding gravitational couplings vanish in the maldacena limit (except

3

for p = 6, where the limit keeps the planck scale of the high-entropy phase held xed),
implying the decoupling of gravity for the dual dynamics. solid lines on the diagrams
denote thermodynamic transitions separating distinct phases, while dotted lines represent
symmetry transformations which change the appropriate low-energy description. we do not
expect sharp phase transitions along these dotted curves since the scaling of the equations
of state is unchanged across them 7.

the structure of the phase diagram for v > 1 is identical to the cases encountered in [7]
(see, for example, figure 1). at high entropies and large m theory t p, we have a perturbative
p+1d sym gas phase. its yang-mills coupling gy increases toward the left, c.f. equation (1).
the eective dimensionless coupling is of order one on the double lines bounding this phase,
which are horowitz-polchinski correspondence curves. as the entropy decreases at large v ,
there is a d0 brane phase arising on the right and middle of the diagrams. its description as
a thermodynamic state within sym theory would be highly interesting. it has a horowitz-
polchinski correspondence point at s  n 2, where a zero specic heat transition is to
occur [38], and localizes into a lc 11d black hole phase for entropies s < n. the line
s  n separates the 11d phases that are localized on the m-theory circle (whose coordinate
size is r11) from those that are delocalized, uniformly across the diagram [16, 17, 18, 19].
the 11d black hole phase at small entropy becomes smeared across the t p when the horizon
size becomes smaller than the torus scale v ; we denote generally such smeared phases by an
overline (in this case 11d). this (de)localization transition of the horizon on the compact
space extends above the s  n transition, separating the black dp brane phase from the
black d0 brane phase 8. susskind [39] has argued that, on the sym side, one should regard
this localization transition as an analogue of the gross-witten large n transition [40]. the
localization transition line runs into the correspondence curve separating the sym gas phase
from the geometrical phases at s  n 2. thus as we move to the left (decreasing v , i.e.
increasing bare sym coupling) at high entropy s > n 2, the sym gas phase reaches a
correspondence point; on the other side of the transition is the phase of black dp-branes. a
further common feature of the diagrams is a self-duality point at v  1 and s  n
7p ,
where a number of u-duality curves meet.

8p

in contrast, the structure of the phase diagrams for v < 1 depends very much on the
specic case at hand. compactications on t p, p = 1, 2, 3, were analyzed in [7]; we now
describe the specics of this region for p = 4, 5, 6.

figure 1 is the phase diagram of t 4 compactication. there are six dierent phases,

7this, does not in principle exclude the possibility of smoother (i.e. higher order) transitions.
8initially, the d0 brane phase becomes smeared to d0; as the entropy increases, the eective geometry
of the latter patch becomes substringy at the horizon, and one should t-dualize into the black dp brane
patch. both the d0 and dp patches have the same equation of state, since they are related by a symmetry
transformation of the theory; they are dierent patches of the same phase.

figure 1: phase diagram of the six-dimensional (2, 0) theory on t 4 s1. s is entropy, v = r/lpl is
the size of a cycle on the t 4 of light-cone m theory, and n is longitudinal momentum quantum. the
dotted lines denote symmetry transformations: m: m lift or reduction; t: t duality; s: s duality.
the solid lines are phase transition curves. double solid lines denote correspondence curves. the
dashed line is the extension of the axis v = 1, and is merely included to help guide the eye. the
label dictionary is as follows: d0: black d0 geometry; w 11: black 11d wave geometry; 11dbh:
11d lc black hole; d0: black smeared d0 geometry; w 11: black smeared 11d wave geometry;
11dbh: 11d smeared lc black hole; d4: black d4 geometry; m 5: black m5 geometry; f 1:
black smeared fundamental string geometry; w b: black smeared iib wave geometry; 10dbh:
iib boosted black hole. the phase diagram can also be considered that of the (2, 0) theory on
t 4/z2  s1 by reinterpreting the f 1, w b, 10d phases, and the matrix string phase as those of a
heterotic theory. .

several of which  the 11d and 11d black hole, black d0 and dp brane, and sym gas
phases  were discussed above. in a slight shift of emphasis, we have relabeled the black d4
brane phase as the black m5 brane phase, since its description in terms of the latter object
extends to the region v < 1 (in fact, even for a patch of v > 1 the d4 brane becomes strongly
coupled and must be lifted to m-theory). the appropriate dual non-gravitational description
involves the six-dimensional (2, 0) eld theory on t 4  s1, where the last factor is the m-
theory circle; the scale of kaluza-klein excitations given by the size of this circle (times the
number of branes) sets the transition point between the (2, 0) and sym descriptions. this
m5 phase consists of six patches that we cycle through via duality transformations required
to maintain a valid low-energy description. the energy per entropy increases toward the left
and toward higher entropies; this is to be contrasted with the cases analyzed in [7] where
the ir limit appears toward the left of the diagrams. this behavior is a consequence of
the reversal of the direction of rg ow between p < 3 and p > 3. as we continue to the
left and/or down on the gure at small volume v < 1, the t 4 is small while the m-theory
circle remains large; eventually one reduces to string theory along the cycles of the t 4,
and the m5-brane dualizes into a string. somewhat further in this direction, we encounter
a horowitz-polchinski correspondence curve, and a transition to a phase consisting of a
matrix string [41, 42, 43] with eective string tension set by the adjacent geometries. using
maldacenas conjecture, we thus validate earlier suggestions to describe matrix strings using
the (2, 0) theory [22, 23, 9]. this matrix string phase has a correspondence curve also for low
entropies, now with respect to a phase of smeared lc m theory black holes (or equivalently
boosted iib holes).

figure 1 is trivially modied to give the phase diagram of the (2, 0) theory on t 4/z2 
s1. the additional structure does not aect the critical behavior of the diagram. the
change appears in the chain of dualities we perform on the dotted lines of the diagram. the
orbifold quotient metamorphoses into world-sheet parity, and the fundamental string patch
(labeled f 1) becomes that of the heterotic string. the emerging matrix string phase at the
correspondence point is then that of a heterotic theory. we thus conrm the suggestion [44,
45] to describe heterotic matrix strings via the (2, 0) theory on t 4/z2  s1. one can
also propose to extend the dual theory of an intermediate state obtained in the chain of
dualities between the m5 and the f 1 patches into the matrix string regime; we then have
heterotic matrix strings encoded in the o(n) theory of type i d strings, as suggested
in [46, 47, 48]. similar statements can be made about matrix theory orbifolds/orientifolds
in other dimensions.

the thermodynamic phase diagram of vebranes (sometimes called the theory of little
[49, 23, 32]) on t 5 is shown in figure 2. we have a total of seven distinct phases.

strings

we again shift the notation somewhat, relabeling the black d5 phase as a black gm5 phase,

characteristic of a string in its hagedorn phase. the temperature determines the tension of
the eective string. we have a patch of black ns5 branes in the middle of the diagram. they
appear near the v  1 line, at which point a t duality transformation exchanges ve branes
in iia and iib theories. the iib ns5 patch connects to a d5 brane patch via s-duality.
the iia ns5 patch lifts to a patch of m5 branes on t 5  s1 at strong coupling on the left.
the extra circle is the m-circle transverse to the wrapped m5-branes; the horizon undergoes
a localization transition on this circle at lower entropy and/or smaller v to a phase whose
equation of state is that of a 5+1d gas. it is interesting that the hagedorn transition is seen
here as a localization/delocalization transition in the black geometry. yet further in this

the d6 phase diagram has two important features (see figure 3). first of all, the
maldacena limit keeps xed the planck scale lpl 
v 2 of the high-entropy black taub-
nut geometry10 [50]. thus, gravity does not decouple, and the limit does not lead to
a non-gravitational dual system that would serve as the denition of m-theory in such a
spacetime. a symptom of this lack of decoupling of gravity is the negative specic heat
s  e3/2 of the high-entropy equation of state. this property is related to the breakdown of
the usual uv-ir correspondence of maldacena duality [51, 20]. the energy-radius relation
of [20] determined by an analysis of the scalar wave equation in the relevant supergravity
background, is in fact the relation between the horizon radius and the hawking temperature
of the associated black geometry; thus, for p = 6 decreasing energy of the hawking quanta
is correlated to increasing radius of the horizon, as a consequence of the negative specic
heat. this is to be contrasted with the situation for p < 5, where the positive specic heat
means increasing horizon radius correlates to increasing temperature; and p = 5, where the
hawking temperature is independent of the horizon radius in the high-entropy regime. now,
temperature in any dual description must be the same as in the supergravity description.
for p < 5, the dual is a eld theory; high temperature means uv physics dominates the
typical interactions, leading to the uv-ir correspondence. for p = 5, the dual is a little

9the tilde is meant to distinguish this eleven-dimensional phase (where the m-circle is transverse to the
ve-branes) from the eleven dimensional lc phase on the lower right, whose m-circle has a dierent origin.

string theory; the temperature is unrelated to the horizon radius (and thus the total energy)
on the gravity side, and unrelated to short-distance physics in the dual little string theory
(since high-energy collisions of strings do not probe short distances). hence the uv-ir
correspondence already breaks down at this point. for p = 6, there is nothing to say  large
radius (large total energy) corresponds to low temperature of probes (hawking quanta);
and any dual description could not have high energy/temperature related to short distance
physics, since it is a theory that contains gravity (so high energy makes big black holes).

a second key feature is the duality symmetry (c.f. [52]) v  v 1 of the diagram relating
the v < 1 structure to that discussed above for v > 1. note that this duality symmetry
inverts the t 6 volume as measured in planck units rather than string units. the duality
interchanges momentum modes with vebrane wrapping modes, while leaving membrane
wrapping modes xed; in other words, the dual space is that seen by the m5 brane. it is
possible that this symmetry extends to any calabi-yau compactication of m-theory, since
the volume of the calabi-yau sits in a universal hypermultiplet whose moduli space appears
to be su(2, 1)/u(2) [53]; if the discrete identications involve the appropriate element of
su(2, 1; z), there will be a dual calabi-yau of roughly the inverse size seen by m-theory
vebranes wrapping the original calabi-yau.

the thermodynamic perspective also sheds light on a proposal of kachru, lawrence, and
silverstein [27] for a denition of matrix theory compactications on calabi-yau spaces.
generically, string theory on a calabi-yau space does not have a t-duality that inverts
its volume in string units. rather, these authors suggest that the appropriate duality to
consider, analogous to the t-duality transformation used by sen-seiberg for torus compact-
ications, is the mirror symmetry transformation. this transformation relates d0-branes in
iia theory on a given calabi-yau to d3-branes wrapping a special lagrangian submanifold
of the iib mirror [54]; locally, the calabi-yau looks like a t 3 bered over an s3 base, and
mirror symmetry is t-duality on the ber. thus, it is proposed that some sort of 3+1 gauge
dynamics might yield an appropriate underlying description. consider the phase diagram
that should arise. at low entropy, one has the 11d black hole phase. as the entropy in-
creases at xed but not large calabi-yau coordinate size v , one nds the horizon smears
over the calabi-yau and eventually one reaches the d0 patch of smeared black d0 branes.
the proper size of the calabi-yau at the horizon in string units is decreasing along this path;
eventually one reaches the curve along which one should perform the duality transformation,
in this case mirror symmetry. naively, in the mirror, as the entropy increases further, the
t 3 wrapped by the d3-branes is increasing in size, while the base s3 continues to shrink;
the high-entropy phase would seem to be described by d3-branes on the special lagrangian
cycle of the mirror calabi-yau near a conifold singularity. however, the duality transfor-
mation will not change the equation of state, since the d0 patch and everything above it
are related by symmetries of the theory. the only thing that could change this conclusion

10

is a further phase transition, but there is no candidate. we conclude that the high-entropy
phase is again one with negative specic heat, and thus cannot be that of a eld theory 11.

1.3 the d1-d5 system
as a further example of our methods, we have examined the d1-d5 system on t 4  s1,
which as we mentioned above can be considered as the little string theory of q5 vebranes,
with q1 units of string winding along the s1. figure 4 shows the thermodynamic phase
diagram. in the maldacena limit, this theory is a representation of the algebra of n = (4, 4)
superconformal transformations in 1+1d [4, 55, 56, 29, 30, 31]. we have dened k  q1q5
and q  q1/q5. we keep k xed, but q may be viewed as a variable ranging between
1 < q < k, thus moving some of the dotted curves of duality transformation, but not
altering phase transition curves. for q  1, we can exchange the roles of q1 and q5 via
duality transformations across the diagram; the structure is unchanged. the other limit,
q = k, is the q5 = 1 bound. the vertical axis on the diagram is again the entropy, while
the horizontal axis is the six-dimensional string coupling g6  gs/v of the d1d5 patch,
where v = v4/2 is the volume of the t 4 in string units (equivalently g2
is the volume of
6
the t 4 in appropriate string units of the ns5fb phase). the phase diagram has a symmetry
g6  1/g6 (inversion of the torus in the ns5fb phase); this is the t-duality symmetry of
the little string theory. from the perspective of the d1d5 patch, we can consider the entire
phase diagram as that of the 1+1d conformal theory that arises in the ir of this gauge
theory, which is conjectured to be dual to the near-horizon geometry ads3  s3  t 4 of the
d1d5 system. in this patch, the d strings are wrapped on a cycle of size r5. this parameter
is absent from the scaling relations of all curves because of conformal symmetry. analogous
to the singly-charged brane systems we have been discussing, at high entropies there is a
1+1d gas phase at small g6 (large v4), which passes across a correspondence curve to the
black brane phase as the coupling increases. being determined by conformal symmetry and
quantization of the central charge, the equation of state does not change across this phase
transition. starting in the 1+1d gas phase and decreasing the entropy, s  k corresponds
to the point where the thermal wavelength in the 1+1d conformal theory becomes of order
the size of the box r5. this is again a horowitz-polchinski correspondence curve from the
side of lower entropies, analogous to the sym theories at s  n 2 12. there is a localization

11note that one could also imagine performing the same duality sequence to describe matrix theory on k3
in terms of two-branes on the torus ber of a near-degenerate mirror k3. in this case one knows that this
description is related to the ve-brane description given above by duality, hence indeed has a 5+1d equation
of state at high entropy, rather than a 2+1d equation of state.

12there is similarly a hidden phases of zero specic heat between the gas phase and the lower, localized

phase, as can be seen by the discontinuity in temperatures that occurs between s > k and s < k.

transition on the r5 cycle cutting obliquely across the diagram. the localized phase can be
interpreted as that of m5 branes with a large boost, thus connecting with the proposal of [33]
for a matrix theory of this system. the lower boundary of this phase occurs at entropies

of order s  k, where a bps matrix string phase emerges and the diagram is truncated

at nite entropy. we nd agreement with vafas argument [57] that the bps spectrum in
the r sector of the d1-d5 system is that of fundamental iib strings carrying winding and
momentum (sometimes called dabholkar-harvey states [58]). similarly, chasing through the
sequence of dualities for the d1-d5 system on k3 s1, one nds the bps spectrum consists
of dabholkar-harvey states of the heterotic string.
the character of the phase diagram is dierent at the extreme limits q  1 (i.e. q1  q5)
and q  k (i.e. q5  q1). the location of the transition curves bounding the ns5w a
patch (type iia ns ve-branes with a wave as the low-energy description) depend on the
ratio x = ln q/ln k. for roughly equal charges q  1, x  0, this patch disappears, as
do the related m5w and m5w patches and the ns5f b patch of fundamental strings
and iib ns5-branes. the d-brane description predominates the phase diagram, except at
low energies where there is a large patch describing fundamental strings with winding and
momentum. the opposite regime, say xed q5 and large q1 so that x  1, is the regime
discussed by [31]; it is also relevant to the dlcq description of the vebrane [33]. indeed,
the high-entropy region s > k is taken over by the ns5f b patch up to the correspondence
curve; while in the low-entropy domain s < k, the ns5w a patch expands to squeeze out
the d0d4, m5w , and f 1w b patches, and the localized phase is covered by the m5w
patch  longitudinal m-theory ve-branes with a large boost, just what one needs for an
innite momentum frame or dlcq description. we discuss the dlcq limit in detail in
section 2.5 below 13.

for simplicity, we have restricted the set of parameters we have considered in the phase
diagram to the entropy and the coupling g6. it is straightforward to see what will happen
as other moduli of the near-horizon geometry are varied. consider for instance decreasing
one of the t 4 radii keeping the total volume xed. at some point, the appropriate low
energy description will require t-duality on this circle, shifting from d1-branes dissolved
into d5-branes, to d2-branes ending on d4-branes. one can then chase this duality around
the diagram: the ns5f b phase becomes m2-branes ending on m5-branes; the ns5w a,
d0d4, and d0d4 phases become d1-branes ending on d3-branes; and the m5w and m5w
phases become those of fundamental strings ending on d3 branes. the near-extremal f 1w b
phase is unaected. one can also imagine replacing the t 4 by k3. moving around the k3
moduli space, when a two-cycle becomes small, a d3-brane wrapping the vanishing cycle

13the relation between the maldacena conjecture and matrix models of m5-branes has also been considered

recently in [59].

becomes light; one should consider making a duality transformation that turns q1 or q5 into
the wrapping number on this cycle.

thus the d1-d5 system appears to have a remarkably varied life. on the one hand, it can
describe low-energy supergravity on a 6d space, namely ads3s3; the common coordinate of
the branes is the angle coordinate on ads3. this space parametrizes physics of the coulomb
branch of the gauge theory. on the other hand, the same system describes the decoupled
dynamics of the ve-brane, another 6d system 14  except that the spatial coordinates are
now t 4  s1, with the t 4 apparently related to the physics of the higgs branch of the
gauge theory, and the s1 the dimension common to the branes. in the maldacena limit, the
theory is a representation of the 1+1d superconformal group; in the dlcq limit, it describes
light-cone m5-branes.

the careful reader will have noted that we have refrained from characterizing the non-
gravitational dual of the d1-d5 geometry as a 1+1d eld theory 15. the standard candidate
for this dual is the 1+1d conformal eld theory (cft) on symk(t 4) (or k3). this cft is
supposed to provide a description of nonperturbative string theory on ads3  s3  t 4 (or
k3). indeed, it captures the high-entropy thermodynamics [28] as well as the bps spectrum
[57, 29, 60]. however, the near horizon geometry appears to put the cft at a singular point
in its moduli space [61, 62]; also, there appears to be a mismatch in the level of the u(1)4
ane algebra of noether charges acting on the t 4 [63]. a basic problem also arises in the
phase diagram of figure 4. in the high-entropy phase, s-duality connects the d1-d5 patch
to the ns5-f 1b patch as one moves to stronger coupling. it is straightforward to check
that, crossing the boundary g6  q1/2, the energy scale of a d1-brane wrapping the torus
t 4 becomes less than that of a fundamental string; the appropriate eective description is
the s-dual one.
in fact there has to be an entire decuplet of strings transforming under
the o(5, 5; z) u-duality group; the proper low-energy description favors one pair of these,
electrically and magnetically charged under one of the ve six-dimensional b-elds (the sub-
group of u-duality xing the description is o(5, 4; z))16. the problem is that the objects
carrying these charges, which are the lightest objects in the theory at intermediate cou-
pling, are not apparent in the symk(t 4) symmetric orbifold anywhere on its moduli space.
similarly, in the d1-d5 system on k3 there should be a full o(5, 21) 26-plet of strings; in
this case, tensionless strings corresponding to wrapped d3-branes arise when a 2-cycle on

14seven-dimensional, if we include the circle transverse to the m 5-brane.
15the following remarks reect ongoing discussions of the rst author with d. kutasov and f. larsen. in

particular, it was d. kutasov that raised the question of whether the dual object is a eld theory.

16there are bps charges corresponding to these objects wrapping t 5, which are central charges in the 10d
supersymmetry algebra. just as in the case of the transverse ve-brane in matrix theory [64], these charges
decouple from the supersymmetry algebra in the maldacena limit; nevertheless the objects remain as nite
energy excitations carrying conserved charges.

14

the k3 degenerates, and are essential in order to regularize the singularities in the eective
description. the 1+1d cft on (symmetric products of) k3 is simply singular, and does
not contain the objects which are needed. these objects are carried, however, as uxes on
the ve-brane one starts with; the energy cost of these excitations simply becomes small at
the relevant points in moduli space, suggesting that the 5+1d string-theoretic character of
the dynamics does not fully decouple in the maldacena limit. similarly, one might expect
that lower dimensional examples of the maldacena conjecture (e.g. those involving ads2 or
ads3) are not fully captured by quantum mechanics or more elaborate 1+1d eld theories.
as mentioned above, it is known that the background elds of the near-horizon limit of the
d1-d5 system correspond in the symmetric orbifold cft to turning o the cft resolution
of the z2 singularities of symk(t 4). it may be that branes wrapping these vanishing cycles
are again the needed ingredient for a well-dened description at these points of moduli space.

1.4 spectral ow and angular momentum
the 1+1d n = (4, 4) superconformal algebra has two canonical realizations, depending on
whether one chooses antiperiodic (ns) or periodic (r) boundary conditions on the fermionic
generators. the spacetime geometry in the maldacena limit of the d1-d5 system is ads3 
s3m4. 2+1d supergravity on asymptotically locally ads3 spacetimes carries a realization
of this superconformal algebra [56, 55]; being a subgroup of the (super)dieomorphism group,
the symmetry extends to the full string theory [31]. ads3 itself is the vacuum state, and lives
in the ns sector since the killing spinors are antiperiodic; hence low-energy supergravity
about this vacuum is described by ns sector representation theory. the r sector is what
one naively discovers as the near-horizon limit of d1-d5 bound states on m4  s1, since the
supercharges are periodic on s1.
a similar situation occurs, for example, in d3-brane gauge theory. the gauge theory on
s3 describes supergravity on ads5  s5 in global coordinates [65], where time translation
is generated by the dilation operator in the conformal group. the gauge theory on ir3 (or
t 3) describes supergravity on a slice of ads5  s5 in poincare coordinates (with periodic
identications for t 3), where time translation is generated by a conformal boost operator.
the poincare slice is obtained as the limiting near-horizon geometry of black d3-branes in
the full string theory. there is no map between gauge theory on s3 and gauge theory on t 3.
a major dierence in the d1-d5 system is that, since the one-dimensional sphere and
torus are the same, the ns and r sectors can be related by a continuous twist of boundary
conditions known as spectral ow. this operation shifts conformal dimensions (hl, hr) and
j3 charges (jl, jr) by [66]

here, ja are the su(2) chiral r-symmetry currents of the n = (4, 4) algebra; e = 1
2 (hl +hr)
is the energy; p = 1
2(hl  hr) is the momentum along x5. we will restrict our attention
to the p = 0 sector. the mode expansions of the supercurrents (which have j =  1
2) are
shifted by . thus spectral ow by  = n + 1
2 , n  z relates ns sector states to r sector
states. moreover, spectral ow by integral amounts   z maps a given sector onto itself;
the spectrum maps to itself, but individual states are not preserved. this, combined with
the charge conjugation symmetry j  j, means that the full spectrum of states in the
theory (for both ns and r sectors) with jl = jr = j is determined by, e.g., ns sector states
with 0  j  k/2. this relation implies a relation between standard conventions in the
literature: h(ram) = h(ns)  k/4, and j(ram) = 0 corresponds to j(ns) = k/2.
in fact, there is a simple operation on the full string theory that reduces to spectral
ow in the near-horizon limit of the d1-d5 bound state: it is the orbifold described by
rohm [67]. the su(2)l  su(2)r r-symmetry of the near-horizon supersymmetry of the
d1-d5 system is inherited from the lorentz group of the asymptotically at spacetime in
which it is embedded in the original string theory. thus the r-symmetry twist is nothing

in the near-horizon region, the geometry is asymptotically ads3 s3m4, and the spectral
ow operation can be understood [68] in the eective chern-simons supergravity theory
that arises [69]. there, spectral ow is implemented by coupling the u(1) u(1) cartan r-
symmetry currents to a source; a shift in the energy arises due to the usual relation between
regularization (framing) of wilson line sources and conformal spin in chern-simons theory
[70].17 it is interesting that, although this twist breaks supersymmetry in the full theory,
anti-de sitter supersymmetry is restored in the near-horizon region;  = 1
2 maps the r sector
of the wrapped brane system to the ns sector, with the r ground state of maximal charge
mapping to the ns vacuum.

unitarity implies that any allowed highest weight representation of the superconformal
group must have h  |j| [71]. spectral ow then implies that allowed states must lie inside
the shaded region of the (h, j) plane in figure 5.18
in particular, spectral ow forces a
cuto on the spectrum of bps supergravity states (regardless of whether they are single- or
multi-particle congurations) at j = k; as is easily seen from the gure, states on the line
h = j beyond this point lie outside the allowed region (since they would have to ow from
states that violate the bps bound). this feature was termed the stringy exclusion principle
in [29]; we see that it depends only on some rather mild assumptions about the quantization
of chern-simons supergravity (i.e., the global structure of the class of geometries under
consideration). all such restrictions disappear in the classical k   limit.

spectral ow determines the density of states  at high entropy and far from the boundary

which is precisely the density of states for d1-d5 black holes with angular momentum (re-
membering the shift in conventions). the expression must be invariant under spectral ow,
when the thermal wavelength is much smaller than the size of the system, because the
fermion boundary conditions are irrelevant. near the boundary of the allowed region, the
density of states will dier from this expression.

a qualitative sketch of the phase diagram as a function of energy and angular momentum

17thus, very little of the quantum structure of gravity is being used here.
18these curves are slightly dierent from the unitarity boundaries of [71, 72] since we are only asking
that a state is the spectral ow of some state in an allowed representation, rather than that it is an allowed
superconformal highest weight.

is given in figure 6. the locations of the phase boundaries are not precisely determined,19
since we only accurately know the phase structure in the vicinity of the ns (j = 0) and r
(j = k/2) sectors. the r sector structure is that of section 2.3, and outlined in the previous
section; the ns phase structure was discussed in [75]: there is a supergravity gas phase (i.e.
the predominant states are dressed fock space states of low-energy supergravity) about the
ads vacuum; at somewhat higher energy the entropy is dominated by a long string phase;
then the string undergoes a correspondence transition to a 5+1d schwarzschild black hole
(i.e. localized on ads3  s3 and smeared on m4); and nally, at high energy the btz black
hole phase with equation of state (5) takes over, as the 5+1d black hole delocalizes on s3.
as a function of angular momentum, there are then phase boundaries where the ns and r
structures abut one another. more details may be found in section 2.6.

2 the details for the phase diagrams

the details of our results can be found in the coming sections. the d4, the d4 on an
orbifold, d5, d6 and d1d5 systems are analyzed in detail in sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and
2.5 respectively. the discussion about spectral ow and angular momentum can be found
in section 2.6.

2.1 the (2, 0) theory on t 4  s1

the m5 phase: our starting point will be d4 branes wrapped on the t 4 t-dual to the
matrix theory description. this phase consists of six geometrical patches and is described
by the equation of state

19since we are now considering nite k, the boundaries between phases are not sharp anyway; they are

crossover transitions rather than singularities in derivatives of the free energy.

19

we next describe the six patches of this phase.
the black d4 brane geometry (d4) is given by the metric and dilaton

10 = h 1/2(cid:16)hdt2 + dy2

4(cid:17)
(4)(cid:17) + h 1/2(cid:16)h1dr2 + r2d2

ds2

e = h 1/4 ,

(9)

we are using the convention that the asymptotic values of the dilaton are absorbed into the
gravitational coupling. the parameters of this geometry are related to the moduli of the
light cone m theory introduced above as follows:

gstr =  lpl

r11!1/2

l 3
pl
r11

,

l 2
plv 1
r11

,

y 

(10)

where in the last equation, we use the notation  to denote the compactication scale for
the four y coordinates, all assumed equal in size. this geometry is subject to the following
restrictions:

 the horowitz-polchinski correspondence principle requires

s > v 12n 2 .

otherwise, we connect to a phase described by perturbative 4+1d sym.

 requiring that the ys are bigger than the string scale yields

s > v 2n 4/3 .

otherwise, we t-dualize into the geometry of n smeared black d0 branes.

 requiring small coupling at the horizon yields

s < v 12n 4/3 .

(11)

(12)

(13)

beyond this point, we describe the vacuum via the geometry of black m5 branes.

the t duality transformation yielding the geometry of smeared d0 branes beyond (12) leads
us for v > 1 onto a phase structure identical to the ones encountered in the three cases
studied in [7]. we will therefore be brief in the description of the right half of the the phase
diagram; a complete discussion can be found in the cited paper. we sketch quickly the
scaling of the various transition curves encountered along this chain in the m5 phase.

20

the smeared black d0 geometry (d0) localizes on the t 4 for

s < v 9/2n 1/2 ,

(14)

into a phase of localized black d0 branes, and gets m lifted to smeared m theory black waves
(w 11) at

at

s  n 4/3v 4/3 .

v  1 ,

(15)

(16)

(18)

(19)

it is seen to be necessary to reduce this latter geometry along one of the cycles of the t 4
to the geometry of iia waves, then to t dualize on the remaining t 3 to a iib theory, and
nally to s dualize to the geometry of black iib waves, to be discussed below. the w 11
geometry furthermore collapses at

into the phase described by the geometry of light cone m theory black holes smeared on
the t 4.
the black m5 geometry (m5) is obtained from the d4 geometry we started with by lifting

s  n

(17)

it, at strong couplings, to an fm theory. it is described by the metric

11 + dy2

4(cid:17) ,
4  hdt2(cid:17) + h 2/3(cid:16)h1dr2 + r2d2

this geometry is subject to the following restrictions:

 requiring that the curvature at the horizon is greater than the planck scale lpl yields
(20)

n > 1 ,

i.e. there is no dual geometrical description for n  1. whatever the string theoretical
description of a few m5 branes is to be, it will take over the phase description beyond
this point.

21

 requiring that the t 4, as measured at the horizon, is bigger than the planck scale
(21)

yields the condition

s > v 3n 4/3 .

(where we have isolated an arbitrary one of the four circles to be that of m-reduction
to iia).

we must otherwise reduce to the geometry of gd4 in some giia theory living on t 3 s1
reducing to gd4 branes wrapped on t 3  s1, we nd that the size of the t 3 as measured
of (21). we then t dualize the gd4 branes to gd1 branes wrapped on s1. we nd than the

iib string coupling measured at the horizon is bigger than one for the reverse of (21). we
then s dualize to the geometry of iib black fundamental strings smeared on the t 3 (f 1)

at the horizon is smaller than the string scale set by  for entropies satisfying the reverse

this geometry is the correct dual in this phase provided that:

 the curvature at the horizon is smaller than the string scale 

s > v 3n 1/2 .

(22)

(23)

(24)

beyond this point, the stringy description is that of a highly excited matrix string, as
we will see shortly.

 the t 3 as measured at the horizon is smaller than the transverse size of the object
(set by the angular part of the metric); this yields again (24). as the box size becomes
bigger than the size of the object, the system localizes on the t 3. taking into account
the changes to the geometry and thermodynamics as in [7],

we nd that the localized fundamental string has its horowitz-polchinski point again
at (24). furthermore, as needed for consistency with this statement, we nd that the
change in the equation of state for this localized phase does not aect the analysis
regarding the matrix string phase we will perform later. other restrictions on the
localized f 1 geometry are all seen to be satised in the region of the parameter space
of interest.

 the t 3 as measured at the horizon must not be substringy. we nd than the size of

the torus as measured at the horizon is at the self-dual point.

 the size of x11 as measured at the horizon is greater than the string scale 

s > v 2n 4/3 .

(26)

we otherwise t dualize on x11, along the string, and obtain the geometry of smeared
iib black waves.

 localization on x11 is of no concern, since the symmetry structure of the metric does
not allow the gregory-laflamme localization (25) (i.e., the brane is stretched along
this cycle).

the iib smeared black wave geometry (w b) is the t dual on x11 of f 1 (equation (22))

10 = (h  1) (dx11  dt)2 + dx2

plv 4

,

r11  r11

,

y3  lplv 2

(28)

(29)

the relevant restrictions are:

 localization on x11 occurs at

s  n .

the system collapses into a new phase described by the geometry of a boosted iib
black hole smeared on t 3.

 the string coupling at the horizon becomes bigger than one at

we then are instructed to perform the chain of dualities s, t(3), m, bringing us back
to the geometry of light cone m theory black waves w 11.

(30)

we thus conclude the analysis of the m5 phase. the dual theory can be inferred from the
m5 patch; it is the six-dimensional (2, 0) theory wrapped on t 4 s1. extending the validity
of this theory throughout the phase diagram, we conclude that we can interpret it as the
phase diagram of the (2, 0) theory. we now move onto the other phases of the (2, 0) theory;
we will be brief in the discussion of the right half of the diagram, since it overlaps in content
with the lower dimensional sym cases [7].

can be found by minimizing the gibbs energies between the equation of state (31) and that
of the matrix string, which we perform below. the smeared hole geometry localizes on the
t 4 at

s  v phase diagram, the 4+1d perturbative sym phase emerges beyond this point.

the matrix string phase: the f 1 geometry encountered above breaks down via the
horowitz-polchinski principle of correspondence at (24). the emerging phase is that of a
matrix string. this can be veried as follows: using the string scale given in this geome-
try (23), we can write down the equation of state of the matrix string phase

matching this energy with that of the m5 phase (6), (or that of the localized f 1 geometry),
yields (24). similarly, we can match the equation of states (36) and that of the iib hole (31),
yielding the matrix string-boosted iib hole transition curve at

s  v 6 .

this phase borders that of the d4 branes and d0 branes.

the nal phase diagram is that of the (2, 0) on t 4  s1, or, as we see from the lc black

hole phase, that of lc m theory on t 4.

2.2 the (2, 0) theory on t4/z2  s1
inspired by the previous discussion of the phase structure of the (2, 0) on t 4 s1, we further
consider the phase structure of this theory on t 4/z2  s1. this corresponds to a corner
in the moduli space of k3  s1; particularly, in addition to considering a square t 4, we
will be ignoring phase dynamics associated with the 16  4 moduli that blow up the xed
points [77]. our parameter space is again two dimensional, entropy s and the volume of the
t 4. there are only two novelties that arise, both leaving the global structure of the phase
diagram unchanged, modifying only the interpretation of the various patches of geometry.

the rst change arises from the eect of the orbifold on the duality transformations; we
will obviously be driven into the other branch of the web of dualities that converge onto m
theory (c.f. [78]). we proceed from the 11d phase of the previous discussion, upward and
counter- clockwise on the phase diagram. we have m theory on a light-cone circle times

25

t 4/z2. we reduce on r11 to d0 branes in iia living on the t 4/z2 at (15). under this
orbifold, the massless spectrum has positive parity eigenvalue. we t dualize on t 4 at (12),
getting to the patch of d4 branes in iia wrapped on t 4/z2. we remind the reader of the
transformation

where we have used the properties of the reection operator on the spinors

t(4)(4)t 1

(4) = (4) ,

i = i

,

2
i = (1)fl

,

{i, j} = 0 ,

(39)

(40)

with the t duality operation reecting the left moving spinors only. here, (1)fl is the left
moving fermion operator. we then m lift to m5 branes in fm theory on t 4/z2  s1 at (13).
next, we have to apply the chain of dualities m, t(3), s near (21). from the m reduction
we obtain gd4 branes on t 3/(1)fl. this is because the m reduction along an orbifold

direction yields the twist eigenvalues for the massless spectrum

g +;  +; b ; c (1) ; c (3) + ,
while the world-sheet parity operator  acts on this spectrum as

g +; +; b ; c (1),(2),(5),(6) +; c (0),(3),(4),(7),(8)  ,

and the action of (1)fl yields

nsns + ;

rr  .

(41)

(42)

(43)

the t duality on t 3 brings us to d1 branes in iib theory on s1  t 3/, which is type i
theory on s1  t 3. this is because

t(3)(3)(1)flt 1

(3) = (1)fl .

(44)

finally, the s duality culminates in the geometry of n black heterotic strings smeared on
the t 3. the horowitz-polchinski correspondence curve (24) patches this phase onto that of
the heterotic matrix string phase, whose equation of state obeys the scaling (36). we thus
verify the following previous suggestions [44, 45, 46, 79] from the perspective of maldacenas
conjecture:

 heterotic matrix string theory emerges in the uv of the (2, 0) theory.
 heterotic matrix strings can be described via the o(n) sym of type i d strings

26

the structure of the phase diagram has not changed, but the labelling of some of the phases
has. the additional symmetry structure of the orbifold background entered our discussion
trivially; the critical behaviors are unaected.

to complete the discussion, we need to address a second change to the t 4 compact-
ication. the localization transitions, say the one occurring at (14), are of a somewhat
dierent nature than the ones encountered earlier. localized black geometries on orbifold
backgrounds are unstable toward collapse toward the nearest xed point; by virtue of being
above extremality, there are static forces, and by virtue of the symmetry structure of the
orbifold, there is no balance of forces as in the toroidal case. it is then most probable that
the localized d0 branes sit at the orbifold points, with their black horizons surrounding the
singularity. the most natural geometry is the one corresponding to 16 black d0 geometries
distributed among the singularities, yielding a non-singular geometry outside the horizons.

2.3 little strings and vebranes on t 5

in this section, we study the thermodynamics of ve branes wrapped on a square t 5. the
notation is as before; we express all equations in terms of the parameters of a lc m the-
ory on t 5. the structure of the phase diagram for v > 1 is similar to the one already
encountered. we will therefore not discuss the d0, d0, w 11, w 11, 11dbh, 11dbh, and
perturbative 5+1d phases except for noting that the only changes to our previous discussion
are to equations (15), (31) and (38), which become respectively

beyond this point, we reduce on one of the cycles of t 5 to a iia theory. we nd that

and we have the geometry of black cm waves smeared on the t 4.

we thus conclude the discussion of this phase comprised of seven patches. we have two
non-local theories sitting on top of the phase, the (2, 0) theory and the (1, 1) theory, related
by a t duality, and bounded by three curves due to nite size eects, and one curve due to
the correspondence principle.

 reduction on the ys along the discussion for the smeared gm5 branes encountered
we then emerge into the phase of cm w 11 black waves.

the geometry of 11d black waves (cmw 11) is obtained via localization on x11 of the smeared
geometry cm w 11. the resulting phase is still smeared on the t 4. it can however further
along x11 into a smeared 11d lc black hole d11dbh. the condition of localization on the

this completes the phase diagram obtained from the d5 system. the structure can
be veried by using the various equations of state. we conclude by noting that there are
several dierent interpretation of this diagram. it is that of the (2, 0) theory; it is that of
the (1, 1) related to the latter by t duality; but it also encompasses the phase structure of
lc m theory on t 5. various previous observations regarding matrix theory on t 5 are thus
conrmed [23, 22] via the maldacena conjecture.

is strongly coupled at the horizon. we therefore, and nally, lift to a black wave geometry

it patches onto the m t n geometry at v  1 via a chain of ve dualities m, t5, s, t5, m
discussed above.
we note the symmetry of the diagram about v  1. the remaining phases were en-
countered in the previous sym examples; there is a phase of localized black d0 branes,
a lc black hole, a smeared lc black hole, and a 6+1d perturbative sym phase. in the
d6 system, each of these phases has a mirror phase about the v  1. the structure can
be further veried by matching the energies, at xed entropy, of the various phases. this
completes the phase diagram for the d6 system, shown in figure 3. we note that:

 the gravitational coupling does not vanish in the m t n and cm t n patches, whereas
 for p = 5, 6 diagrams involving p+1d sym, the energy decreases for higher entropies,

unlike the p < 5 cases; i.e. the specic heat is negative.

 localization on x5 occurs unless condition (130) is satised.
 localization on x(3) occurs unless condition (143) is satised. this is irrelevant in view

of (130).

 requiring that x11 as measured at the horizon is bigger than the string scale yields

equation (123).

 small coupling at the horizon requires the reverse of (135).
 and nally, we note that the geometry is at the self-dual point for the three cycles x(3).
the geometry of boosted ns5 branes of the iia theory (ns5w a) is obtained from the
ns5f b patch via t duality or the m5w via m reduction. the only relevant restriction is
that of large t 4 at the horizon. this occurs for

g6 < 1 .

(145)

otherwise, we have the t dual, and identical, geometry with dierent asymptotic moduli.

we have completed the boosted m5 phase up to the condition (145). we note that
all duality transformations along g6  1 leave the geometries unchanged, and change the
asymptotic moduli. it is easy then to check that venturing into domains with g6 > 1 yields
a mirrored picture of the phase diagram about g6  1. our six patches have six other mirror
geometries across the g6  1 line. we therefore see a signature of a strong-weak symmetry
g6  1/g6 in the dual theory, which is t-duality of the little string. as we scan through
1 < q < k, at the lower bound the phase structure is such that, via dualities exchanging q1
and q5, a mirrored phase diagram for q < 1 emerges; for the upper bound, the geometrical
vacua across the diagram break down via the correspondence principle. these comments
carry over to the other phases, which we describe next.

(148)

there are three patches. the localized boosted fundamental string (f 1w b) is obtained

from the f 1w b patch by localization on x5. the relevant restrictions are:

 small curvature at the horizon requires

s > k1/2 .

(149)

at this point, we emerge in a matrix string phase carrying two charges. more on this
later.

 localization on x(3) occurs unless (149) is satised. this is similar to what we saw in

the 4+1d sym case.

 large x11 at the horizon requires (123).
 small coupling at the horizon necessitates

s < k2/3q1/6 .

(150)

beyond this point, we apply the chain s, t(3), m to patch onto the localized boosted
m5 geometry. the reverse of this chain was described in the smeared case above.

 finally, the geometry is at the self-dual point for the x(3) cycles.

43

the localized boosted black m5 brane geometry (m5w ) has the same parameters as (132).
it is subject to one additional non-trivial condition, that of m reduction along x11 unless

s < k2/3q1/3 .

(151)

we then emerge into the geometry of localized d0d4 branes.
the localized d0d4 brane geometry (d0d4) is subject to the following additional condition;
its curvature at the horizon is small when

s < k .

(152)

otherwise, the dual geometrical description breaks down. comparing the equations of
state (148) and (120), we nd that we do not have a match at s  k. this is identical
to the situation encountered in all the sym cases at s  n 2. there is a non-trivial transi-
tion at this point through a phase with zero specic heat. on the 1+1d gas side, s  k is
where the thermal wavelength becomes the size of the box r5; the dynamics is then frozen
into a quantum mechanics.

the bps matrix string: at s  k1/2, the emerging phase is that of the ramond ground
states of the conformal theory, which are those of a bps matrix string. the situation can be
compared to the matrix string transition of the m5-brane on t 4  s1 discussed in section
2.1. there, we found a correspondence curve at s  v 3q1/2
, beyond which a perturbative
string description should be valid. at the transition, the ratio of the cycle sizes at the horizon
of the t 4 and the s1 was (y4/ r11)2  v 6  q5/s2; in particular, since v  1, the dynamics
is eectively one-dimensional. in the localized (m5w ) phase of the d1-d5 system, we have
(y4/r11)2  h 1
1 at the transition s  k1/2, which is again of order q5/s2.
we conclude that the two transitions are the same. in the present case, the emerging phase
is bps; a perturbative string carrying both winding q5 and momentum q1 quanta obeys
the virasoro constraints

comments on dlcq of the m5-brane: as mentioned in the introductory summary, the
limit q5 xed, q1  q5, is relevant to the dlcq description of the m5-brane [33, 34, 35, 36].

44

units of the string scale, appropriate for the decoupled dynamics of the little string inside
the vebrane. in terms of the d1-d5 parameters, the dlcq parameters are

the coordinate size of the t 4 is held xed in the string units of the ns5fb phase that

converting (120) to dlcq parameters (155), we nd

s = 2(q5/l)

1

2 lplm ,

(156)

which is indeed the equation of state of a hagedorn string with tension proportional to
l/q5, as has been seen previously from several related points of view [80, 81].
it is a
nontrivial check that this equation of state agrees precisely with equation (50) when we use

the parameters (65) of the gm5 phase 22.

21we thank o. aharony for correcting an error we were making in the rst version of this paper. we had
originally taken a somewhat dierent dlcq limit; however, this limit sends the little string scale to zero. it
may nevertheless be an interesting limit; when more than one type of brane is present, there is an ambiguity
in how one decouples gravity. there are more than two length scales: that set by the string tension, and
that set by the two gauge couplings on the branes. the decoupling limit can then set the dimensionless
ratios of these scales to any particular value of interest. in terms of the geometry, one can for instance take
the standard maldacena limit r0  1, 5, where one passes to the far infrared of both gauge theories; or
one might consider e.g. 5  r0  1, in which case gravity still decouples but one retains the scale set by
the vebrane gauge theory.
22the light-cone scaling was determined in [81]; our contribution is a check that the precise numerical

coecient agrees.

45

the same exercise can be repeated for the localized (m5w ) phase. the equation of state
(148) in dlcq parameters, again assuming light-cone kinematics elc  m 2/2p , takes the
form

in terms of scaling, this equation of state is the energy-entropy relation of a 2+1d gas
(extensive in the box size 1/4
), although it is dicult to explain the dependence on q1
and q5. a natural candidate for the object being observed here is an excited m2-brane
embedded in the m5-brane (which is indeed one of the bound states of m-theory). the
q1 dependence appears to violate lorentz invariance; it would be interesting to understand
why light-cone kinematics does not work in the low-energy, low-entropy regime; and why
the low-entropy phase is not a boosted version of the 5+1d gas found for the m5-brane in
equation (77).

2.6 spectral ow and rotating black holes

we now turn to a discussion of angular momentum in the d1-d5 system. as pointed out
in section (1.4), spectral ow is an adiabatic twisting of boundary conditions in the full
string theory before the maldacena limit; the near-horizon limit maps the twist onto the
spectral ow operation in the superconformal algebra. on the geometry side, a point on the
unitarity diagram (figure 5) in the ns sector, far from the boundary and at high conformal
weight, is described by the btz black hole geometry (independent of the fermion boundary
conditions) [82, 29, 30, 83], in a space which is asymptotically locally ads3s3m4; in the
r sector, such a point represents the near horizon geometry of a rotating d1d5 system [84]
(due to the shift in conventions between canonical denitions of ns and r sector quantum
numbers). the isometry so(4) = su(2)l  su(2)r of the transverse s3, combines with the
(4, 4) supersymmetry generators and the sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) symmetry of ads3, to yield
two copies of the n = 4 superconformal algebra; a gauge transformation in su(2) can be
used to shift the boundary conditions on the supercharges, yielding an isomorphism between
the ns and r sectors [66]. the charges under the cartan subgroups of each of the two
su(2)s parametrize the angular momenta of the rotating d1d5 or btz hole geometries.
the subalgebra of concern is then two copies of the n = 2 superconformal algebra with
two u(1) r-symmetry generators j 3
l,r  j that implement the spectral ow. we
restrict our attention to equal left and right u(1) charges.
consider rst the ns sector. the qualitative features of the density of states about j = 0
were discussed in [75]. there are several phases. consider the regime of suciently large

the btz black hole phase [75] with s  (kh)1/2.23 for kg3/2
 k, there is a phase of
5+1d schwarzschild black holes because the horizon localizes on s3; the entropy is of order
s  k1/3h4/3. the lower bound is the correspondence point; thus, for g3/2
 kg3/2
,
there is a hagedorn phase, with s  hg1/2
e , the system is in a
supergravity gas phase, with s  h5/6. at weak coupling ge < 1, the 5+1d schwarzschild
phase and the supergravity gas phase disappear.

 h, we have the black
d1d5 system. for 0 < h <
e k, we have the m5w or d0d4 phase localized on x5. finally,
at h  0, the bps matrix string cuts the diagram at nite and large entropy s  k1/2. for
ge < 1, we have an additional phase with entropy s  k for gek <
 k squeezed between
the d1d5 and d0d4 phases. on the phase diagram of figure 4, this corresponded to the
horizontal line segment at s  k. as argued in [85], we see that the d1d5 system without
angular momentum does not localize on the s3 at low energies, whereas the stationary
btz hole in the ns sector does undergo such a localization [75]. the spectral ow map
adiabatically relates the states of these two sectors; the diering phase structures obtained
at zero charge in the ns and r sectors (the latter owing to e.g. j = k/2 in the ns sector)
then implies that the spinning d1d5 system must undergo a localization transition on the
s3 at a critical value of the angular momentum. we next analyze the possibility for such a
transition.

 h <

 g2

the equation of state of the rotating d1d5 phase can be extracted from the corresponding

geometry [84], and is given by (5)

btz  kh  j  2 .
s2

(158)

this phase should callapse at a critical value of j  to a 5+1d black hole localized and spinning
on the s3. angular momentum is introduced in this phase by spinning up the black hole
along an orbit on the equator of s3 with momentum p  j /rads; kinematic relations and
the schwarzschild equation of state then imply

s6d  k1/3(cid:16)h2  j  2(cid:17)2/3

 k1/3h4/3 ,

(159)

where, in the last step, we have taken the non-relativistic limit h  j ; we will see that this is
justied. in the relativistic limit the hole approaches extremality; one obtains a gravitational

23the standard conventions for the btz metric, where length and time scales are referred to the ads
curvature radius, dier from those of the d1d5 geometry encountered in the r sector, where scales are often
referred to the scale r5. matching the asymptotics of the metrics yields the relation en srads  err5  h,
where r4
ads  g6k. we write subsequent equations in terms of the invariant conformal weight h to avoid
confusion.

wave on s3 with h  j , thus matching onto the bps spectrum of supergravity states. this
regime occurs near the boundary of the unitarity plot, where the hagedorn or gas phase
takes over the 5+1d black hole. the localization on the s3 will then occur if sbtz < s6d at
a given energy, i.e.

k!2
< j 

h
k

+  h

k!8/3

.

(160)

for h < k, i.e. for the horizon size smaller than the size of the s3, we can ignore the last
term, and we have the condition

h <

.

(161)

j  2
k

note that for j  near zero, the corresponding localization condition cannot be met [85].
for j   k, however, this equation can be satised: the direct analysis in the ns sector
j  = 1
2k shows that a localized phase exists at large enough ge. we conclude that the
d1d5 system indeed localizes on the s3 at a critical value of the angular momentum. note
that our uncertainty in the location of the transition is due to the fact that it is sensitive
to the numerical accuracy of the equations, not just the scalings of the thermodynamic
parameters (and therefore lies beyond the scope of our geometrical analysis). continuing to
lower conformal weights in the r sector, the equation of state of the rotating d0d4 phase is
given by [86]

s2  k  h

g6!2/3

 j 2 .

(162)

in the ns sector, the rotating btz hole localizes on s3 as the energy is lowered; the equation
of state is roughly (159) (without the primes). as extremality is approached, the spinning
black hole reaches the correspondence point and becomes a large fundamental string carrying
angular momentum

shag  [g1/2

e h  j2] .

(163)

below this, there should be a transition where a supergravity gas extremizes the free energy.
the phase structure about the ns sector j  0 should sew onto the phase structure about the
r sector j  k/2 in some intermediate regime. most of the above formulae are not invariant
under spectral ow; they are determined in an analysis about zero angular momentum
relative to the ns or r sectors, and may be corrected by large gravitational back-reaction
when j  k. we leave an analysis of these eects to future work.
for ge < 1, the picture is slightly dierent (see figure 6). there is no 5+1d black hole
or supergravity gas phase in the ns sector. the phase labeled sqm has an entropy which
is energy independent s  k. as mentioned above, it correponds to the horizontal line at
s  k in figure 4. we again defer a detailed analysis to future work.

it is a curious fact that, for nite k, the spectral ow relation between the ns and r
sectors implies an ir cuto in the spectrum of particle states in the latter.
in the ns
sector, the eigenmodes of the free scalar wave equation have a natural gap in the spectrum
of order 1/rads  (g2
6k)1/2; however, in the r sector, the free spectrum is continuous.
nevertheless, in the full quantum theory, spectral ow from one sector to the other implies
that the nite density of states in the ns sector gives a nite r sector density of states; in
other words, nite k generates an eective ir cuto. this cuto disappears in the classical
k   limit, as one sees for example in the fact that the number of bps states in the r
sector is o(k). this feature is a property of all maldacena-inspired denitions of quantum
gravity (i.e. using nite n dual nongravitational systems) where the dual theory is in nite
volume (e.g. a torus); the nite density of states due to the ir cuto in the gauge theory
imposes an eective cuto at large radius in the supergravity  even though the classical
wave equations in such geometries can have continuous spectra. it would be interesting to
understand this phenomenon better (it is not obviously related to the uv-ir correspondence
of [51]).
