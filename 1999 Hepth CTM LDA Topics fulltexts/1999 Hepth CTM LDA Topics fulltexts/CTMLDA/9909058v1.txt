abstract

we provide explicit examples of supersymmetric domain walls of a ve-
dimensional simple (n=2, u(1)) gauged supergravity theory constructed by gu-
naydin, townsend and sierra. these conformally at solutions interpolate be-
tween supersymmetric isolated anti-desitter vacua, satisfy the killing spinor (rst
order) dierential equations, have the energy density related to the cosmological
constants of the isolated supersymmetric vacua, and the four-dimensional world
on the domain wall is a at (minkowski) world with n=1 supersymmetry. a
detailed analysis of such solutions is given for the example of one (real, neutral)
vector supermultiplet with the most general form of the prepotential. as the
gauge coupling becomes very large (compared to ve-dimensional planck con-
stant), these domain walls become innitely thin, and a special case of a z2
symmetric domain wall is a supersymmetric realization of the static domain wall
solution considered by randall and sundrum.

1 introduction

the past few months have witnessed exciting progress in the study of domain walls in
d=5 gravity theories. such congurations are interesting from two, on a surface or-
thogonal perspectives: (i) in the context of ads/cft correspondence such conformally
at congurations provide new insights in the study of rge ows [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
and (ii) in the context of phenomenological implications, such congurations provide a
framework [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] to address the physics implications of large (fth)
dimensions for the four-dimensional world on the domain-wall.

within the rst approach a number of conformally at solutions were constructed and
in particular the ones interpolating between supersymmetric anti-desitter (ads) vacua
of n=8 d=5 gauged theory provide explicit examples of static domain walls in d=5;
one such example[2, 5] involves two scalar elds and thus was solved numerically.

within the second approach innitely thin, static, z2-symmetric ve-dimensional do-
main wall solutions were constructed [11, 12] (and generalizations that incorporate
eects of additional compactied dimensions [13, 15, 16]). these solutions had to sat-
isfy a specic relation between the domain wall tension  and the cosmological constant
 of the ads ve-dimensional vacua, thus implying a ne-tuning.

the purpose of this letter is few-fold. we shall provide explicit examples of supersym-
metric domain walls in ve-dimensions, in the simplest supergravity theory, i.e. the
supergravity theory with least supersymmetry that allows for the explicit constructions
of supersymmetric domain wall congurations. in order to demonstrate the existence
of domain wall solutions in this framework, such a supergravity theory necessarily has
to have a potential for (gauge neutral) scalar elds, and the only known such examples
are gauged supergravity theories. we thus choose to work within a framework of a ve-
dimensional n=2, u(1) gauged supergravity formulated by gunaydin, townsend and
sierra [17].3 for the sake of concreteness we shall analyse the case with one physical
(gauge neutral) vector supereld which allows for an explicit analysis of the possible
domain wall congurations.

the important upshot of the analysis is that this framework provides examples of static
domain walls, i.e. conformally at solutions interpolating between isolated supersym-
metric vacua with (non-positive) cosmological constants. those are bps-saturated
congurations, satisfying the killing spinor (rst order) dierential equations, and have
the energy density of the wall (wall tension) related in a specic manner to cosmologi-
cal constants of the isolated supersymmetric vacua on each side of the wall (an analog
of a saturated coleman-deluccia[18] bound applied to ve-dimensions). namely, the
relationship between the domain-wall tension and the cosmological constant is a con-
sequence of the bps nature of the solution, and not an artifact of ne-tuning. these
congurations have four unbroken supercharges or in other words break 1
2 of n=2, d=5
3such a theory may have its origin as a compactication of type iib superstring theory on a specic
einstein-sasaki-5-manifolds or as compactication of m-theory on calabi-yau with non-trivial uxes
turned on. but the details are unkown so far and remain to be worked out.

supersymmetry, and thus the four-dimensional world on the domain wall has n=1 su-
persymmetry.4 a special example of innitely thin bps domain walls (corresponding
to the case of very large gauge coupling), with z2 symmetry corresponds to a concrete
supersymmetric realization of the static domain wall solution found by randall and
sundrum [11].

2 d=5 n=2 u(1) gauged supergravity

supergravity in d=5 is very restrictive with respect to allowed potentials. the only
allowed potentials come from gauging of isometries and especially interesting are poten-
tials that have no run-away behavior (scalars become aymptotically constant) with
non-trivial isolated extrema. this type of potential allows for the existence of domain
walls with extrema corresponding to the ads vacua on each side of the wall. the min-
imal gauged supergravity (n=2 gauged supergravity with u(1) gauged r-symmetry),
constructed in [17, 21], provides such a set-up. in this case one can consistently decou-
ple the hyper-multiplets and the lagrangian contains only the supergravity multiplet
and the vector supermultiplets. (there are also domain wall solutions, that couple to
non-trivial hypermultiplets [22], but they do not have asymptotic anti-de sitter spaces.)
in this case the bosonic lagrangian reads:

s5 = z h1

r + g2v

48 z cijkf i  f j  ak (1)

we chose the convention where the ve-dimensional newtons constant is  = 1 and g
is the gauge coupling. we work in the (, +, +, +, +) convention. the physical scalars
a, which are real and neutral, correspond to the scalar components of the vector
super-multiplets and dene coordinates of the manifold dened by [17]

f =

with cijk real, and the x i are the auxiliary real scalar elds. the metric(s) of the
scalar manifold gab (for physical scalars a) and gij (for auxiliary scalars x i) are
dened by

gij =

where hi are real constants, speciying the fayet-iliopoulos(fi) terms, and the super-
potential w is dened as

w = hix i .

(5)

notice, w is subject to the constraint (2) which makes it non-linear in the physical
scalars a.

supersymmetry transformations and bps domain walls

we are searching for supersymmetric (bps) domain wall solutions: those are solutions
that preserve part of the supersymmetry, and thus satisfy the killing spinor equa-
tions, which are rst order dierential equations what ensure that the supersymmetry
transformations in this domain wall background are preserved.

we chose these domain wall solutions to be neutral, and thus they are supported only
by (gauge neutral) scalars with the gauge elds turned o. thus, the supersymmetry
transformations for these backgounds read: [17]

2gabb + i 3

2 gaw(cid:17) ,

a = (cid:16)  i
 = (cid:16) + 1

4ab

 ab + 1

2g w(cid:17) .

(6)

the vacuum is given by the asymptotic space, where the scalars are constant and
thus supersymmetry requires aw = 0. the form of the potential v (4) implies that
supersymmetric vacua are always extrema of the potential.

the domain wall ansatz for the metric is of the form:

ds2 = a(z)h  dt2 + dx2

1 + dx2

2 + dx2

3i + dz2 ,

(7)

and the scalars have the form a = a(z), where z = {, +} is a direction
transverse to the wall.

then the killing spinor equations  = 0 and a = 0 are solved by:

5note the parallels with the potential in d=4 n=1 supergravity where: v = ek(cid:16)ga bdaw dbw 

z log a = 2gw

4

and

za = 3ggabbw

(9)

where the four component spinor satises the constraint: z = .
note that as long as the domain of physical elds contain two isolated supersymmetric
vacua, this set of solutions specify the bps domain wall. the physical domain means
especially, that the scalar metric gab remains positive denite, excluding any tachyonic
modes.

the domain wall tension can be determined by applying the nesters procedure (for
d=4 domain wall solutions, see appendix a of [19].) which relates the wall tension 
to the central charge of the supersymmetry algebra; the central charge is determined by
the values of the superpotential at each aymptotically supersymmetric vacuum. the
result is (the details will be given elsewhere [23].):

bp s =

126(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

q+  q(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(10)

where w  w (a|z=).
in the second part of (10) we have used the relation-
ship between the cosmological constant  and the value of the superpotential w for
supersymmetric vacua. note that  is determined by sign[wz=+wz=]. thus, the
domain wall tension is specied by the values of the cosmological constants of the
aymptotic ads vacua. according to ( 10) there are three types bps domain domain
walls (very much parallel to the analysis of the types of bps domain walls in d=4 [24],
their global space-time structure [25] and their relationship to non-supersymmetric
congurations [26]):

 type i domain walls interpolate supersymmetric minkowski space-time ( =
. these
0) and the ads space time (+   6= 0). in this case bp s = 1
126
walls saturate an analog of the coleman-deluccia bound in ve dimensions. on
the asymptotic ads side the metric coecient takes the form a(z) = e 2
3  z;
on the ads side of the wall z   corresponds to the ads horizon. the geodesic
extension of these space-time could either pure ads or new regions that involve
an inntie tiling with the mirror domain walls.

 type ii domain walls interpolate between supersymmetric ads vacua where
126(cid:16)+ + (cid:17), and the
sign[w] = sign[w+] and thus bp s = 1
asymptotic metric bahaves as a(z) = e 2
3  |z|; on each side of the walls the
ads space-time is described in terms of horosperical coordinates with z  
corresponding to the ads horizons and thus the geodesic extensions that could
involve either pure ads or new regions that involve an inntie tiling with the
mirror domain walls. (those domain walls can be viewed as stable; non-
supersymmetric generalizations are expanding bubbles on each side of the ads
vacua.) a special case of z2 symmetric solution (w+ = w) satises the
constraint: bp s = 1
66

 which is precisely a relationship found in [11].

5

 type iii domain walls are those between two supersymmetric ads vacua where
126(cid:16)+(cid:17). the met-
sign[w] = +sign[w+] and thus bp s = 1
ric coecient grows exponentially on one side of the wall as a(z) = e+max[ 2
and thus on this side, |z|   limit corresponds to the boundary of the ads
space! (those are the unstable domain wall solutions whose non-supersymmetric
generalizations corresponds to falls vacuum decay bubbles, only.)

for the sake of being explicit we will address the case of a single vector multiplet.
dening the physical scalar as  = x 1/x 0 the constraint (2) takes the form:

f = (x 0)3 (a + b + c2 + d3) = 1

and the superpotential (5)becomes:

w = x 0(h0 + h1) .

(11)

(12)

where x 0 is the auxiliary eld eliminated by eq. (11). the metric g, and the derivative
of the potential w take the form:

g =

(13)

(14)

(15)

there are some general observations: (i) the superpotential (12) allows for at most
two extrema, where w = 0. (ii) expanding w arround a given extremum yields for
the second derivative: 2
w|extr (see e.g. [6]) and using this relation one
can verify that w cannot have two extrema with g > 0 and which are connected, i.e.
with no pole in between. (note, these lines of arguments hold only for the one-scalar
case. if w depends on more than one scalar, it may allow for two minima, which can
be smoothly connected.)

w|extr = 2

to discuss the solution in more detail, we will consider the case:
a = 0 , b = d = h0 = 1 , c = 3 ,

g = 0,

h1 = 3

(16)

one can verify, that this choice contains all general properties described above and
does not yield any physical restrictions. in this case the metric, superpotential and its
derivate can be written in the following form

g = 32 + 1 + 322 + 3

the corresponding killing spinor equations for the metric coecient a(z) is given in
(8)and that for the scalar eld (9) takes the form:

(20)

in this coordinate system it is dicult to solve the equations explicitly. following the
arguments discussed in [6] one can obtain an explicit solution if we introduce a new
radial coordinate dened by

dz =

gre2u (r) .

(21)

the dening equation for the scalar eld  (11) describes a curve in the 2-dimensional
space 6 spanned by (x 0, x 1) and supersymmetry requires that along the ow the
normal vector remains parallel to a harmonic vector hi = hi

if r   the scalar  = x 1/x 0 becomes constant and we reach an ads vacuum
with w = 0. we are however interested only in such vacua where g is positive. as
we will discuss now, this imposes a constraint on the parameter .

6in general this is not a single connnected curve, but consist of branches separated by singular

lines where f = 0, see [21].

7

analysis of the potential and an example

the rst useful observation is that in the region where the metric g has real poles,
g has no real zeroes. namely, the poles and zeros are at the following values of 

poles of g : { 1

2(3  32  4), 0}

zeroes for g :   32 + 4
23(2  1)

(24)

(25)

(27)

thus for 2 > 4/3 there are no zeroes of the metric, but there are poles for the values
of  specied by (24).

supersymmetric vacua are determined by zeroes of w (19). there are at most two,
where  takes the value:

zeroes for w :

(  )  2   + 2  1

3(  1)

(26)

note also that the poles of w , w and g are identical. if 2 > 4
two real zeros of w , but for 2 < 4

3 we nd always

3 only if
2(  32 + 4)} and
2(  32 + 4)} .

  max{ 1
  min{ 1

therefore we have to address two separate cases:

 2 < 4

3: in this case w has no poles and thus one extrema has to be a maximum
and the other a minimum. therefore, the scalar metric g is negative for one
value of (26). this domain of the parameter space describes no domain wall
solution.
 2 > 4

3: for this case there are no restriction on ; both values of (26) are real. in
addition g has only poles, but no zeroes (cf. (24-25)). therefore both extrema
are minima and are separated by poles of w . thus the domain wall interpolating
between such supersymmetric extrema corresponds to a kink solution that goes
over the region where the potential blows up mildly. near this pole, we can solve
the killing equations (8) and (9) also in the z-coordinate basis.
instead of a
typical behavior where   pole  (z  zpole), now: the kink slows-down and
behaves near the pole as: pole  (zzpole)3 and the metric coecient behaves
as7 a  (z  zpole)2gc where c depends on the pole-value of  . (it is negative for
 < 1

3(1) and positive for  > 1

3(1) .

7note that the energy density contributing to the domain wall tension is nite and thus the nesters

procedure for the derivation of bp s (which employs stokes theorem) remains applicable.

8

figure 1: the domain wall solution for the scalar eld (z) and the metric coecient
a(z) is depicted for the choice of parameters  = 1.2 and  = 0.6. note the slow-
down of the kink and a suppresion of the metric coecient a(z) in the region in the
middle of the wall.

for the sake of concreteness we will an exhibit explicit solution with  > 23 and
0 <  < 1 which has the property that the two supersymmetric minima (26) are
sandwiched between the smallest value of the pole (24). the choice of  = 1.2 and
 = 0.6 corresponds to two zeroes of w at  = and the poles at  =. the asymptotic
values of w have opposite sign and thus the wall it type ii. the numerical result is
given in figure.

4 conclusions

the specic realization of supersymmetric domain walls in the simplest ve-dimensional
supergravity demonstrates a number of interesting features. the superpotential w as
function of a single scalar can have at most two extrema, but there is no smooth ow
possible while demanding that the scalar metric remains positive (g > 0). two ads
vacua with positive scalar metric have to be separated by a pole in the superpoten-
tial and the corresponding domain wall represents a supergravity kink solution that
interpolates between the two branches. despite this singularity, a stable kink solution
exists (with the scalar eld slowing-down mildly in the region crossing the pole) and
the energy density, as calculated by nesters procedure, is nite and given by the sum
or dierence (depending on the signs of w ) of the asymptotic cosmological constants.

as for particle phenomenology, we have claried an important connection between
domain wall tension and the cosmological constants of isolated d=5 string vacua. as a
by product we see that the domain-wall world is at and is supersymmetric, i.e. along
with the massless graviton there is an acommpanying gravitino. the hypermultiplets

9

of d=5 gauged supergravity coupld potentially play a role of matter on the domain
wall, a subject of further investigations.

we conclude with another note, that the break-down of supersymmetry (by either of
the vacua) would ensure that the non-extreme walls would become expanding bubbles
(see the analysis given in for non-supersymmetric domain walls in d=4 in [26] and for
a somewhat related analysis in d=5 in [27].)

could it be that the four-dimensional world is indeed a domain-wall world of gauged
supergravity theory?
