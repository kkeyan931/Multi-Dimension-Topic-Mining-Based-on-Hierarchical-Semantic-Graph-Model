abstract

we construct iib supergravity (viewed as dilatonic gravity) background
with non-trivial dilaton and with curved four-dimensional space. such a
background may describe another vacuum of maximally supersymmetric
yang-mills theory or strong coupling regime of (non)-supersymmetric gauge
theory with (power-like) running gauge coupling which depends on curva-
ture. curvature dependent quark-antiquark potential is calculated where
the geometry type of hyperbolic (or de sitter universe) shows (or not) the
tendency of the connement. generalization of iib supergravity background
with non-constant axion is presented. quark-antiquark potential being again
curvature-dependent has a possibility to produce the standard area law for
large separations.

1 introduction

ads/cft correspondence [1] may provide new insights to the understanding
of non-perturbative qcd. for example, in frames of type 0 string theory the
attempts[2] have been done to reproduce such well-known qcd eects as run-
ning gauge coupling and possibly connement. it is among the rst problems
to get the description of well-known qcd phenomena from bulk/boundary
correspondence.

in another approach one can consider iib supergravity (sg) vacuum
which describes the strong coupling regime of a non-supersymmetric gauge
theory. this can be achieved by the consideration of deformed iib sg vac-
uums, for an example, with non-constant dilaton which breaks conformal
invariance and supersymmetry (susy) of boundary supersymmetric yang-
mills (ym) theory. such a background will be the perturbation of ads5  s5
vacuum. the background of such a sort (with non-trivial dilaton) which in-
terpolates between ads (uv) and at space with singular dilaton (ir) has
been found in ref.[3] where also conformal dimensions for (dilaton coupled)
scalar have been found.

this solution of iib sg [3] has been used in ref.[4] with the interpreta-
tion of it as the one describing the running gauge coupling (via exponent
of dilaton).
it has been shown that running gauge coupling has a power
law behavior with ultraviolet (uv) stable xed point and quark-antiquark
potential[5] has been calculated. qcd properties of such a background have
been discussed in detail in refs.[6]. modications of iib sg solution with non-
constant dilaton [3] due to presence of axion[7], constant self-dual vector[8]
or world volume scalar [9] give further proof of the possible connement
and asymptotic freedom of the boundary non-susy gauge theory. unfor-
tunately, situation is very complicated here due to double role of iib sg
backgrounds. from one side they may indeed correspond to ir gauge the-
ory (deformation of initial susy ym theory). on the same time such a
background may simply describe another vacuum of the same maximally su-
persymmetric ym theory with non-zero vacuum expectation value (vev) of
some operator. due to the fact that operators corresponding to deformation
to another gauge theory are not known, it is unclear what is the case under
discussion (interpretation of sg background). only some indirect arguments
as below may be given. as we see these arguments indicate that iib sg back-
ground discussed in this work most probably corresponds to another vacuum
of super ym theory under consideration. then renormalization group (rg)

ow is induced in the theory via giving a non-zero vev to some operator.

in the present paper, we continue the study of running dilaton and con-
nement from iib supergravity backgrounds with non-trivial dilaton. we
generalize the solution of ref.[3] for non-zero curvature of d-dimensional space.
as a result, iib supergravity background is changed drastically. the running
dilaton (gauge coupling) depends explicitly on the four-dimensional curva-
ture. the structure of quark-antiquark potential is modied.
in a sense,
connement would become the characteristic of the universe.

let us make few remarks on ads/cft interpretation of iib sg back-
ground. choosing the coordinates in the asymptotically ads5 spacetime as

ds2 = d2 + s()

ijdxidxj ,

xi,j=0

(1)

let assume a scalar eld , e.g. dilaton, axion or other elds, obey the
following equation:

d2
d2 + 4

d
d

(2)
near the boundary. here m 2 is the mass of  and   0 corresponds to the
boundary of ads. then  is associated with the operator o with conformal
dimension  = 2 + 4 + m 2. the solution of (2) is given by

= m 2

 = ae(4) + be .

(3)

the solution corresponding to a is not normalizable but the solution to
b is normalizable. according to the argument in [19], the non-normalizable
solution would be associated with the deformation of the n = 4 theory by o
but the normalizable solution would be associated with a dierent vacuum
where o has a non-zero vacuum expectation value. the behavior of the
dilaton found in this paper is normalizable and seems to be associated with
the dimension 4 operator, say trf 2. then the argument in [19] would indicate
that the solution found in this paper should correspond to another vacuum
of n = 4 theory. nevertheless, there might be still possibility that the
solution corresponds to non-supersymmetric gauge theory. since there occurs
the condensation of trf 2 in the usual non-supersymmetric qcd, however,
the solution given here would describe some features typical for the non-
supersymmetric theory.

the situation is even more complicated due to limits of validity of dual
sg description. in order that the classical supergravity description is valid,

(6)

the curvature should be small and the string coupling should be also small.
if the curvature is large, the  corrections from string theory would appear.
in the ads/cft correspondence, the radius rs of the curvature is given by

rs = (4gsn)

.

(4)

here gs is the string coupling and n is the number of the coincident d-branes.
therefore we should require

on the other hand, the classical picture works when the string coupling is
small:

in the solution given in this paper, there appears the curvature singularity
and gs depends on the coordinates since the dilaton is non-trivial. if we con-
centrate on the behavior near the boundary, which is asymptotically ads and
is far from the singularity, the solution would be reliable and sg description
would be trusted.

the work is organized as follows. in the next section we give iib super-
gravity background with non-constant dilaton and non-at four-dimensional
space. via ads/cft it gives the curvature dependent (power-like) running
gauge coupling and quark-antiquark potential where hyperbolic geometry
seems to support connement. in section 3 we generalize the background of
section 2 for the case when axion presents. (curvature dependent) quark-
antiquark potential is found. it is shown that inationary universe (de sit-
ter) with axion might predict connement. some outlook is given in the
last section. additional solutions of iib supergravity are presented in two
appendixes.

2 solution, running gauge coupling and

quark-antiquark potential

we start from the following action of dilatonic gravity in d + 1 dimensions:

s = 

1

16g z dd+1xg (r    g) .

(7)

in the following, we assume 2   and  to be positive. the action (7) is
very general. it contains the eective action of type iib string theory. the

4

type iib supergravity, which is the low energy eective action of the type iib
string theory, has a vacuum with only non-zero metric and the anti-self-dual
ve-form. the latter is given by the freund-rubin-type ansatz:

f = 
fijkpq = 


2  , , ,   = 0, 1,   , 4

i, j,   = 5,   , 9 .
2 ijkpq ,

(8)

the vacuum has the topology of ads5s5. since ads5 has a four dimensional
minkowski space as a subspace, especially on its boundary, ads5 has the
four dimensional poincare symmetry iso(1, 3). s5 has, of course, so(6)
symmetry.

as an extension, we can consider the solution where the dilaton is non-
trivial but the anti-self-dual ve-form is the same as in (8). furthermore if
we require the solution has the symmetry of iso(1, 3)  so(6), the metric
should have the following form:

ds2 = g dxdx + gmndxmdxn

(9)

where gmn is the metric of s5 and ref.[3]

g dxdx = f (y)dy2 + y

d1

xi,j=0

ijdxidxj .

(10)

in order to keep the symmetry of iso(1, 3)  so(6), the dilaton eld  can
only depend on y. then by integrating ve coordinates on s5, we obtain the
eective ve dimensional theory, which corresponds to d = 4 and  = 1
2 case
in (7). we keep working with above dilatonic gravity as it will be easy to
come to iib supergravity (d = 4,  = 1

2) at any step.

from the variation of the action (7) with respect to the metric g, we

(12)

we assume that  depends only on one of the coordinate, say y  xd as in
type iib supergravity solution with the symmetry of iso(1, 3) so(6) and
we also assume, as a generalization of (10), that g has the following form

here gij is the metric in the einstein manifold, which is dened by

rij = kgij .

(14)

here rij is the ricci tensor given by gij and k is a constant, especially k > 0
for sphere and k = 0 for the at minkowski space and k < 0 for hyperboloid.
such a solution generalizes the previous solution of ref.[3] (where k = 0) as
boundary gauge qft lives now in four-dimensional curved spacetime. the
case of k = 1 is especially interesting as it corresponds to gauge theory in de
sitter (inationary) universe.

of (, ) = (0, i) or (i, 0) is identically satised. integrating (17), we nd

(18)

substituting (18) into (15), we can solve it algebraically with respect to f :

f =

d(d  1)
4y22(cid:16)1 + c2

2y(cid:17)
2yd + kd

then we nd from (18) and (19),

 = cz dyvuut

d(d  1)
4yd+22(cid:16)1 + c2

2y(cid:17)
2yd + kd

when y is small, f (y) in (19) behaves as

f (y) 

d(d  1)yd2

4c2

,

(19)

(20)

(21)

which makes a curvature singularity at y = 0. the scalar curvature behaves
when y  0 as

(22)

r  c2yd .

the curvature singularity would be generated by the singular behavior of the
dilaton  when y  0:

(y)  sgn(c)s d(d  1)

ln y .

here sgn(c) expresses the sign of c:

sgn(c) = ( +1

if

c > 0
c < 0

.

(23)

(24)

the curvature singularity tells there should appear the  correction from the
string theory and the supergravity description would break down when y  0.
conversely and hopefully, the curvature singularity might be apparent and
vanish when we can include full string corrections. in any case, the solution
would be valid if we investigate the behavior near the boundary (y  +).
we also note that the dilaton eld behaves near the boundary (y  +)
as

  0  cs d  1

d2yd +    .

the term of o(cid:18) 1

2(cid:19) might tell that the solution given here would correspond

to the condensation of the dimension d operator, say, trf 2. in the usual non-
(or lower-)supersymmetric qcd, it is widely believed that there would occur
the condensation of trf 2. therefore not depending on that the solution
given here corresponds the real deformation from the n = 4 theory or the
deformation of the vacuum, the solution would possibly reect the structure
of non-supersymmetric qcd.

if we change the coordinate y by , which is dened by

(27)

(30)

(31)

here 2() is given by solving y in (26) with respect to : 2() = y().
when  is small, y is large and the structure of the spacetime becomes ads
asymptotically. from (26), we nd

(28)

(29)

we can compare the above behavior with that of the previous ads5  s5
solution in type iib supergravity [4]. the ads5 part in the solution has the
form of

where gs is the string coupling and n is the ux of the ve-form f in (8)
through s5, which is produced by the n coincident d3-branes. using the
denition of rs in (29), the solution (19) and (20) has the following form:

f =

.

(32)

here we put  = 1
background. on the other hand, if we change the coordinate by

2 and d = 4 in order to get explicitly iib supergravity

the metric in (13) has the following form

 = z dyqf (y) ,

g dxdx = d2 + s()

gijdxidxj ,

d1

xi,j=0

(33)

(34)

where s() is given by solving y in (33) with respect to : s() = y().

we now consider the case k < 0. first let the dilaton eld to be constant
or small. then from eq.(19), when y decreases from the positive innity, the
function f increases and diverges at a nite value of y : y = y0 and after
that the signature of the metric seems to change. this is not, however, real
but apparent. near y = y0, the function f (y) behaves as

f (y) 

f0
y  y0

,

where f0 is a constant. when we introduce a new coordinate u by

y  y0 = u2 ,

the metric has the following form when y  y0,
xi,j=0

d+1  4f0du2 + y0

ds2

d1

ijdxidxj .

(35)

(36)

(37)

the metric in (37) is regular even when u  0 (y  y0) and there is no
curvature singularity. the change of coordinates in (36) tells that y increases

9

again as u increases when u > 0. then when we write the solution by the
coordinate u, the solution connects two boundaries at u =  and u = +.
the structure of the spacetime, however, changes when the dilaton becomes
large. let us write f (y) in the following form:

f (y) =

d(d  1)
4y22h(y)

,

h(y)  1 +

c2
2yd +

kd
2y

.

(38)

we now investigate the condition h(y) vanishes or f (y) diverges and changes
its sign. the minimum hmin of h(y) can be found by the equation dh(y)
dy = 0,
which can be solved as follows:

y = y0

and we nd

hmin = 1 +

we now consider the running of the gauge coupling. usually the ads
string coupling, which is the square of the coupling in n = 4 su(n) super-
yang-mills when d = 4, is proportional to an exponential of the dilaton eld
, which we assume in the following. from (20), when y is large and d > 2,
we nd that the dilaton eld behaves as

y = u 2 ,

(46)

u expresses the scale on the (boundary) d dimensional space (due to hologra-
phy [10]). following the correspondence between long-distances/high-energy
in the ads/cft scheme, u can be regarded as the energy scale of the bound-
ary eld theory. then from (43), we obtain the following renormalization

the leading behavior is identical with the previous works [4, 6, 7, 8] but the
next to leading term contains the fractional power of (g  gs) although the
square of (g gs) appears for k = 0 case. we should note that the qualitative
behavior does not depend on  which appears in the coupling (43).
hence, we found that beta-function explicitly depends on the curvature
of four-dimensional manifold. of course, curvature dependence is not yet
logarithmic as it happens with usual quantum eld theories (qfts) (per-
turbative consideration) in curved spacetime [11]. the power-like running of
gauge coupling is much stronger than in k = 0 case. note that previous dis-
cussion of power-like running includes guts with large internal dimensions
[12]. in the case under investigation we get the gauge coupling beta-function
as an expansion on fractional powers of gauge coupling.

we now consider the static potential between quark and anti-

quark[5]. we evaluate the following nambu-goto action

boundary manifold so that the line given by x0 =constant, x1  x and
x2 = x3 =    = xd1 = 0 is geodesic and g11 = 1 on the line. substituting
the conguration into (48), we nd

self energies can be estimated by considering the conguration x0 =  , x1 =
x2 = x3 =    = xd1 = 0 and y = y() (note that x1 vanishes here) and
the minimum of y is yd where brane would lies. we divide the region for y
to two ones,  > y > y0 and y0 > y > yd. using the parameterization of

here we neglected the l independent terms. note that leading and next-

k = 0 it was cubic ), which does not depend on the dimension d. since

of course, the connement depends on the large l behavior of the po-
tential. when l is large, however, the orbit of the string would approach to
the curvature singularity at y = 0, where the supergravity description would
break down. despite of this, it might be interesting to investigate the large
l behavior. since the behavior of f (y) and the dilaton  when y is small is
given by (21) and (23), the integrand in (51) behaves as

when d = 4, 0 < 0 < 2 when c > 0 and  < 0 when c < 0. according to
the analysis in [19], the orbit of the string goes straight to the region y  0
when c > 0 (0 < 0 < 2) and the potential becomes independent of l. in
this case, however, the potential would receive the  correction from the
string theory. on the other hand, when c < 0 ( < 0), there is an eective
barrier which prevents the orbit of string from approaching into the curvature
singularity and the potential would not receive the  correction so much and
the supergravity description would be reliable. furthermore c < 0 ( < 0)
case predicts the connement.

we can also evaluate the potential between monopole and anti-monopole

by using the nambu-goto action for d-string instead of (48) (cf.ref.[13]):

for the static conguration x0 =  , x1  x = , x2 = x3 =    = xd1 = 0
and y = y(x), we nd, instead of (51)

(64)

we should note that k() is replaced by 1
k() compared with quark anti-quark
case (51), which corresponds the replacement of   . as the potential
in (60) does not depend on  in the given order, we nd the monopole anti-
monopole potential em m is identical with eq q when l is small:

em m(l) = eq q(l) .

we should note that sgn(c) in (61) and (62) is replaced by sgn(c) in (66) and
(67). therefore the behavior of the potential between monopole and anti-
monopole for large l is changed from that of the potential between quark
and anti-quark, that is, monopole and anti-monopole would be conned for
c > 0 but would not be conned for c < 0.

it is not dicult to study the curvature dependence in more detail, for
example, numerically for dierent choices of parameters and regions. never-
theless, we do not do this as most qualitative features are clear.

3 axionic background with non-zero curva-

ture and non-constant dilaton

let us present now the generalization of the above iib sg background with
non-trivial dilaton when non-constant axion is included into the action. such
a study for the case of at four-dimensional space has been presented earlier
in ref.[7] (for the eects of additional scalars, see also ref.[9]).

we include the axion eld  into the action of type iib supergravity

the obtained metric is identical to that in (19), where the axion vanishes,

2 . therefore there appears the curvature
singularity at y = 0 again and the supergravity description would breaks
down when y  0. note that as we work with iib sg we assume that d = 4.

we now introduce a new coordinate  by

(84)

we should note that k-dependence does not appear in  and  if we use the
coordinate  because it is hidden in this coordinate. if we choose 0 = 0, e 
0. since 4e can be regarded as the yang-mills coupling constant and   0
(y  +) corresponds to the ultraviolet xed point from the viewpoint of
ads/cft correspondence, the theory can be regarded as asymptotically free.

18

we now compare the above results with those in [7] for k = 0 and d = 4.

we introduce a new coordinate r by

eq 2c

(85)

(88)

then the solution in [7] seems to be a special case corresponding to 0 =
0 = 0.

let us consider the potential between quark and anti-quark. as we are
interested in the case of asymptotically free theory, we put 0 = 0 in (81)
and d = 4. then we nd

therefore the linear potential in the next-to-leading term becomes attractive
if k < 0 and repulsive if k > 0. the result is consistent to the potential
without axion in (60). we should note that eqs.(78) and (81) tell that the
dilaton eld behaves as

  s d(d  1)

2

ln y ,

(95)

which corresponds c < 0 case in the pure dilaton case in (23). since the
behavior of f (y) in (77) is essential identical with the pure dilaton case in
(19), the supergravity description would be valid even for large l and the
connement for quarks would be predicted (and monopoles would not be
conned).

we now investigate the supersymmetric background. for k = 0 it has
been found in ref.[7]. we look for its k-dependent generalization. since we
consider the background where the fermion elds, that is, dilatino  and
gravitino  vanish, if the variation under some of the supersymmetry trans-
formations of these fermionic elds vanishes, the corresponding supersymme-
tries are preserved. the supersymmetry transformations of these elds are
given by [14]

(97)

21

therefore all the supersymmetries break down in general since  and 
do not vanish. in the limit of c  0, however, we nd

  0 ,

 .

(98)

therefore there is a possibility that half of the supersymmetries correspond-
ing to  survives in this limit. it should be noted that, in the limit, f (y) in
(77) becomes

f =

d(d  1)
2y(cid:17)
4y22(cid:16)1 + kd

,

(99)

which tells that the metric of the spacetime becomes nothing but the metric
of ads5s5 although the dilaton and the axion elds are non-trivial. then if
we choose the spinor parameter  by using the killing spinor  in ads5  s5
as follows[14, 7]

 vanishes in the limit of c  0, which tells that half of the supersymmetry
corresponding to , in fact, survives in this limit. this situation does not
depend on k. such a solution corresponds to some vacuum of maximally
supersymmetric ym theory where supersymmetry is broken to n = 2 .
(note that deformations of n = 4 super ym theory which ow to xed
points like in refs.[15, 16] may also dene running gauge coupling). in the
limit of c  0, the solution in (81) and (82) has the following form:

e  c(  0)
1
  0 

c(  0)

.

(101)

even in the limit, the theory becomes asymptotically free when 0 = 0 since
the coupling is assumed to be given by e vanishes in the ultraviolet limit
corresponding to  = 0. we should also note that the potential (0 = 0 case)
between quark and anti-quark in (93) is not changed in the leading and next-
to-leading orders since c is not included to the corresponding expression.

4 discussion

in summary, we found the background of iib supergravity with non-constant
dilaton, non-zero curvature of four-dimensional space-time and with (or with-
out) non-trivial axion. by assuming the coupling is given by the exponential
of the dilaton eld , ads/cft interpretation of such a solution gives the
(power-like) running gauge coupling and predicts its curvature dependence.
in the presence of axion, background may have half of supersymmetries un-
broken. in all cases, we calculated quark-antiquark potential and showed that
the term linear on distance l explicitly depends on the curvature. hence,
there is the possibility that curvature of universe might predict the conne-
ment.

the complete interpretation of iib sg background via ads/cft cor-
respondence is not yet clear. we gave the arguments that most probably
our background corresponds to another vacuum of maximally supersymmet-
ric ym theory with some non-zero vev operator. however, the possibility
that it may be deformation of theory to another less symmetric (super) ym
theory is not yet completely ruled out. the only possibility to understand
it now is to investigate all properties of sg background and compare it with
properties of corresponding qft.

for example, it would be really interesting to nd further development
of such a scenario so that to present more realistic (logarithmic) behavior
for running gauge coupling. clearly, major modications of background are
necessary. note in that respect the recent paper [17] where it was shown that
ads orbifolds may describe the running gauge coupling.

acknowelegements. we would like to thank h.b. nielsen for discussion of
two-times cosmology. we are also indebted to a. tseytlin and a. sugamoto
for discussions and the referee o f this work for asking the questions which
led to signicant revision of original ms.

appendix a

in this appendix, we point out that there are many kinds of einstein mani-
folds which satisfy eq.(14). the einstein equations are given by,

g = t matter



.

(102)

here t matter
sider the vacuum solution where t matter





is the energy-momentum tensor of the matter elds. if we con-

= 0, eq.(102) can be rewritten as

r =


2

g .

(103)

if we put  = 2k, eq.(103) is nothing but the equation for the einstein
manifold (14). the einstein manifolds are not always homogeneous manifolds
like at minkowski, (anti-)de sitter space or nariai space but they can be
some black hole solutions like schwarzschild black hole,

(105)

for k 6= 0.
in these solutions, the curvature singularity at r = 0 has a
form of line penetrating ads5 and the horizon makes a tube surrounding the
singularity. this conguration seems to express d-string whose boundary lies
on the boundary of ads5 or possibly d3-brane. especially in case of kerr
or kerr-(anti-)de sitter solution, the object corresponding to the singularity
has an angular momentum.

we should note that the dilaton depends on the geometry of the boundary
manifold only through k as in (20). therefore the behavior of the running
coupling or renormalization group equation is irrelevant with the existence
of the black hole singularity.

appendix b

in this appendix we present one more solution of iib supergravity with two
time like signatures of metric. the physical interpretation of this solution is
not quite clear as well as its dual interpretation.

it was already few times mentioned that ads radial coordinate plays the
role of energy coordinate via holographic correspondence. it is also known

4this type of solutions for k = 0 case has been considered in ref. [18]

24

that in general relativity there were attempts to identify the energy with
time ow. then the following interesting question appears: can the same
sort ads solution be re-interpreted as the one depending from extra time
coordinates? in a sense one has then new iib sg solution with a few time-
like signatures. there was some discussion of solutions with a few times-like
signatures in various gravitational theories.

in order to get the time dependent solution and consider a kind of ads
cosmology, we perform the analytic continuation in the solution in (19) and
(20) with k = 0 as follows:

ln(1) .
then we obtain the following metric and the dilaton eld:

c2  c2 , 0  0

d+1 = = f (y)dy2 + y

2c2

we can directly check that the solution (107-109) satises (11) and (12).
when 2  c2
yd < 0, dilaton eld  is real and f (y) becomes negative, which
tells that y can be regarded as another time coordinate (ads time) besides
the physical time coordinate in d-dimensional minkowski space corresponding
to ij in (107). we have unusual signature of the metric with two time-like
coordinates. changing the coordinate y by

1
d

y =   c2
2 !

sin

d t ,

(110)

we obtain the following metric and the dilaton eld

(111)

.

(112)

25

note that t = 0,  corresponds to y = 0. therefore there is a curvature
singularity there. this tells that  expansion in string theories becomes
unreliable and we need to exclude the region t  0, . eq.(112) tells that the
coupling becomes t-dependent, especially in case of type iib supergravity
case we nd

g = gse0 = gs(cid:18)1  cos t
sin t (cid:19)

2 2

d

.

(113)

if we change the coordinate t by  as

 =   d  1

dc!z

we have the metric in the following form

where

(114)

(115)

(116)

note that t is solved with respect to  by using (114). it follows from the
above speculation that one can understand running of gauge coupling also
as dependence on second time (ads time).
it would be interesting to
understand if such a picture may have any physical meaning.

the conclusion drawn from such an interpretation is that ads solution
may contain a few times. then the possibility of a kind of phase transition
between these times should be considered (this is, of course, highly specu-
lative). the physical time should be naturally dened by observer living in
such a world. one possibility may be to introduce potential depending on
angles dening the sort of signature of any particular dimension. then the
minimum of this potential may probably dene the real physical time. in
any case, the interpretation of iib sg solution considered in this appendix
could be understood simply as one more iib sg solution.
