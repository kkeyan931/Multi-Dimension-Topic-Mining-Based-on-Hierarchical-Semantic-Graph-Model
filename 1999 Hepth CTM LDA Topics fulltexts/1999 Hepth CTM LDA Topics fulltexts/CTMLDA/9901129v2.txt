abstract

we study the ward-takahashi identities in the standard model with the gauge

xing terms given by (1.1) and (1.2). we nd that the isolated singularities of the

propagators for the unphysical particles are poles of even order, not the simple poles

people have assumed them to be. furthermore, the position of these poles are ultravio-

let divergent. thus the standard model in the alpha gauge in general, and the feynman

gauge in particular, is not renormalizable. we study also the case with the gauge xing

terms (1.3), and nd that the propagators remain non-renormalizable. the only gauge

without these diculties is the landau gauge. as emphasized by bonneau[1], one must

make a distinction between the renormalizability of the green functions and that of

the physical scattering amplitudes.

1. introduction

in this paper, we shall explore some of the exact and non-perturbative consequences of

the ward-takahashi identities in the standard model.

the organization of this paper will be as follows: in sec. 2, we study the 2  2 mixing
matrix of propagators for the longitudinal w and the charged higgs meson with the gauge

xing term of w chosen to be

1
w



(w +

 + iw m0+)(w 

  iw m0) ,

(1.1)

where  are the charged higgs elds, m0 is the bare mass1 of w , and w is the gauge

parameter. this study has been carried out by a number of authors[2,3]. indeed, we could

have started where they left o, but we opt for making the presentation more self-contained.
in sec. 3, we study the 3  3 mixing matrix of propagators for the longitudinal a, the
longitudinal z and 0, where 0 is the unphysical neutral higgs meson, (the imaginary part

of the neutral higgs meson) with the gauge xing term chosen to be

1

(z  + zm00)2

(a)2 ,

(1.2)

where m 

0 is the bare mass of z, and z and a are gauge parameters.

in sec. 4, we study these propagators when the gauge xing terms are, instead of (1.1)

and (1.2),

(1.3)

in sec. 5, we discuss the meaning of our results.

in appendix a, we list the brst variations of the elds in the standard model, in

the gauge of (1.1) and (1.2). in appendix b, we present an alternative way to derive the

ward-takahashi identities[4], and list the three ward-takahashi identities for propagators

involving the longitudinal w , in the gauge of (1.1). in appendix c, we list the nine ward-

takahashi identities for propagators involving the longitudinal a and the longitudinal z, in

the gauge of (1.2). in appendix d, we present the derivations of the three relations satised

1the bare mass m0 is equal to 1

2 g0v0, where v0 may be dened either as the classical vacuum value or

the quantum vacuum value of the higgs eld. the green functions dier with dierent denitions of v0, but

by gauge invariance, physical quantities remain the same with either denition.

by the 1pi amplitudes of the propagators in the 3  3 mixing matrix, in the gauge of (1.2).
in appendix e, we list the twelve ward-takahashi identities in the gauge of (1.3), and derive

the relations satised by the 1pi self-energy amplitudes.

2. the mixing of w and the charged higgs meson

in the standard model, a longitudinal w meson may propagate into either a longitudi-

nal w or a higgs meson with the same charge. thus all of the following propagators

< 0|t w +
 (x)w 
< 0|t +(x)w 

 (0)|0 > , < 0|t w +
 (x)(0)|0 > ,
 (0)|0 > , < 0|t +(x)(0)|0 > ,

are none-zero and together they form a 2  2 mixing matrix. we shall denote the fourier
transform of such a propagator with the symbol g and put

gw +w (k)  idt
gw +
(k) =
g+(k) 



w w (k2)t  iw dw w (k2)l ,
g+w 

w dw (k2) ,



ik

(k) 
id+(k2) ,

where

t  g

.

the d functions are so dened that their unperturbed forms in the gauge of (1.1) are simply

d(0)

w w (k2) = d(0)

+(k2) =

1

k2  wm 2

0

(2.1)

they are nite and non-zero at w = 0. the unperturbed form for dw  is zero.

the charged higgs meson mixes not with the transverse w but with the longitudinal w ,
as is indicated by the factor k in the expression for gw +. thus, in the 2  2 mixing
matrix under discussion, this factor k can be replaced by k, where

k2

k 

for the same reason, kk/k2 can be replaced by unity. the 2 2 mixing matrix is therefore
equal to

iw dw w
ikw dw /m0

ikw dw /m0

id+




.

(2.2)

we shall express the propagators by their 1pi amplitudes.

in a eld theory without mixing, let the unperturbed propagator for a particle be i(k2 
m2)1, and let the 1pi self-energy amplitude be , then this propagator is the inverse of
i(k2  m2  ). now that the unperturbed propagators in the mixing matrix are given by
(2.1), the mixing matrix (2.2) is equal to the inverse of




i (k2  m 2

0  w w w ) /w
ikw /m0

ikw /m0

i(k2  w m 2

0  +)




,

(2.3)

where w , for example, is the 1pi amplitudes for dw . the 1pi amplitudes are functions

of k2 and , the dependence of which will be exhibited only when needed. inverting the

matrix in (2.3), we nd that the mixing matrix in (2.2) is equal to

i(k2  w m 2

0  +)w

ikw w /m0



(k2  w m 2

ikw w /m0

i(k2  w m 2

0  w w w )




.

0  +)(k2  w m 2

0  w w w ) + k2w 2

w m 2

substituting the matrix elements in (2.4) into the ward identity (b.4a), we get[2,3]

(m 2

0 + w w )(m 2

0 +/k2) = (m 2

0 + w )2 ,

0  m 2

(2.5)

as a side remark, (2.5) provides a subtraction condition. by setting k2 to zero in (2.5), we

nd that

+(0) = 0 .

(2.6)

this ensures the divergence of + to be a logarithmic one. if we express the real part

of the neutral higgs eld as (v0 + h), and choose v0 to be the quantum value of the higgs

eld, then the higgs potential has a term linear in h. this term acts as a counter term

which cancels all contributions of tadpole diagrams. with the absence of the contributions

of the tadpole diagrams, the self-energy amplitude w  is only logarithmically divergent,

not quadratically divergent. by (2.5), so is w w . we also note that, with v0 the quantum

vacuum value, the higgs potential has a mass term for . when we calculate +, we

include the contributions of this mass term. but to incorporate the condition (2.6), we

4

make a subtraction for + at k2 = 0. the contributions of the mass term vanish after

subtraction.

the denominator in (2.4) is simplied if we take advantage of (2.5). we may, for example,

use (2.5) to eliminate + from the denominator, which then becomes

where

thus we have

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9a)

(2.9b)

(2.9c)

,

note that the denominator in the expressions in (2.9) is the square of jw . since the poles

of these propagators come from the zeroes of jw , and since jw is a linear superposition of

1pi self-energy amplitudes, which are analytic functions of k2, the order of the poles of the

propagators are always even.

propagators in quantum eld theories generally have simple poles. it is therefore easy to

be lulled into believing that poles of propagators are simple poles. we have found that this

is often not true when two elds mix under the auspices of the ward-takahashi identities.

in particular, the charged  and the longitudinal w have the same unperturbed mass. thus

the poles of the unperturbed propagators for these elds are both at k2 = w m 2

0 . as the

interactions are turned on and the propagators form a mixing matrix, the positions of the

poles change but the ward-takahashi identities force them to remain to be at the same

point. thus the two simple poles merge to form a double pole.

the function jw contains divergent integrals. since no subtraction conditions are avail-

able, we expect that the location of the zero of jw be ultraviolet divergent. this is conrmed

5

by a perturbative calculation. we nd that jw has a zero at

in (2.10), we keep only the terms which are ultraviolet divergent and we have not included

the contributions of quark or lepton loops. since the ratio of (2.10) and the transverse mass

pole in the above expression is innite, the double pole in (2.10) cannot be made nite.

let the fourier transform of < 0|t i+(x)(0)|0 > be denoted as

where + and  are hermitian ghost elds associated with w . the ward-takahashi identity

(b.4b) gives

d+ =

1 + w m 2
jw (1 + g0e)

,

(2.11)

where e is dened in (b.5). the ghost propagator has only one factor of jw in the denom-

inator.

6

since the pole of a function cannot be removed by multiplying the function by a con-

stant, the propagators cannot be made nite by wavefunction renormalizations. the stan-

dard model in the alpha gauge in general, and the feynman gauge in particular, is not

renormalizable.

let us set w = 0. in this limit, (2.8) becomes

jw = k2(1 + w m 2

0 ) .

thus we have, in the landau gauge,

,

,

(2.12)

(2.13a)

(2.13b)

with the propagators gw + and gw +w 

l

vanishing at w = 0. because of (2.6), both

propagators in (2.13) have a simple pole at k = 0. these propagators are renormalizable by

wavefunction renormalizations.

3. the mixing of a, z and 0

in this section we discuss the a, z, and 0 mixing with the gauge xing terms given by

(1.2).

the longitudinal z meson mixes with 0 as well as with the longitudinal a, where 0 is

the imaginary part of the neutral higgs meson and is unphysical. thus the propagators for
these elds form a 3  3 matrix. let the propagators be denoted as
aa(k2)t  iadaa(k2)l ,
zz(k2)t  izdzz(k2)l ,

where aa, for example, is the 1pi amplitude for daa. there are nine ward-takahashi

identities for these propagators, the derivation of which is given in appendix c. three of

these identities give the following three relations among the 1pi amplitudes,[2,3]:

(m  2

0 + zz)(m  2

0 00/k2) = (m  2

0 + z)2 ,

0  m  2

and

(m  2

0 + z)az = (m  2

0 + zz)a .

(3.3a)

(3.3b)

(3.3c)

the derivation of these relations is presented in appendix d. note the resemblance of (2.5)

with (3.3a), indeed with (3.3b) and (3.3c) as well, if one takes into account that the photon

is massless.

8

next we calculate the inverse of (3.2) and equate it to the matrix in (3.1). we defer the

details to appendix d and give only the results here:

(3.5)

note that all the propagators above except daa have a double pole at the simple zero

of jz. the existence of this double pole is again easy to understand. the unperturbed

longitudinal z and the unperturbed 0 have the same mass, while the unperturbed a has

zero mass. thus dzz and d00 have simple poles at the same position, while daa has a

simple pole at k2 = 0. as the interactions are turned on, the ward-takahashi identities

require that the position of the former two poles remain to be the same, while that of the

last pole remains to be zero. thus the propagators in (3.4) have a double pole as well as a

simple pole at k2 = 0.

a perturbative calculation shows that the zero of jz is located at

(3.6)

these propagators cannot be made nite by wavefunction renormalizations. one can easily

check that this double pole is dierent from the pole of the transverse part of the photon-z

mixing sector.

from the ward-takahashi identities (c.4)(c.7), we get

daa(k2) =

(1 + g0cfz)jz + ze0fzaz

k2jz(1 + e0fa + g0cfz)

(3.7b)

(3.7c)

(3.7d)

which express the ghost propagators in terms of the 1pi self-energy amplitudes as well as

the three-point functions fa and fz dened by the equations following (c.4).

note that the ghost propagators in (3.7) have poles at k2 = 0 as well as at a zero of jz.

this is because the unperturbed propagators of the ghosts have a simple pole at k2 = 0 and

a simple pole at k2 = zm  2

00. as interactions
are turned on, the ward-takahashi identities require that the former remains to be at k2 = 0,

0 , same as the position of the unperturbed d(0)

while the latter remains to be at the same position as the pole of d00.

finally, we go to the landau gauge by setting all alphas to zero. then the only non-zero

g for the unphysical mesons is

g00

=

i

k2  00

,

(3.8)

which is logarithmically divergent and is renormalizable by a wave function renormalization

of 0.

also, as we set z to zero, we nd that

daz = dz a ,

and the mixing matrix of the propagators of the neutral ghosts is symmetric. such a matrix

can be diagonalized by an orthogonal transformation. we may therefore renormalize these

ghost propagators by renormalizing the rotated ghost elds obtained by diagonalization.

4. the pure alpha gauge

we have shown that, if the alphas are not zero, the propagators in the preceding two

sections have double poles with positions which are ultraviolet divergent. consequently, the

standard model with the gauge xing terms of (1.1) and (1.2) are not renormalizable. we

emphasize that the divergence of the double pole is sucient but not necessary for the theory

10

of the unrenormalizable. an example is provided by the quantum theory of the standard

model with the gauge xing terms those in (1.3).

the unperturbed propagators of the elds in this gauge are given in (e.4). we see from

the matrix which follows (e.4) that if we set m 

0 to zero, the o-diagonal propagators vanish
while both diagonal propagators have a simple pole at k2 = 0. in this limit, the charged

higgs meson is a goldstone boson decoupled from the longitudinal w , the latter meson being

also massless as a result of the gauge condition. next we turn m to a non-zero value. the

charged higgs meson remains to be a goldstone boson but now it couples with w , which

also remains massless because of the gauge condition. the two simple poles at k2 = 0 merge

and form a double pole at k2 = 0, (the propagator dw w has only a simple pole at k2 = 0

because of the gauge condition.) similar considerations hold for the propagators of a, z,

and 0.

to see what happens when the coupling constants are turned on, we rst derive the

twelve ward-takahashi identities satised by the two-point functions. these identities are

listed in (e.3). they are somewhat dierent in forms from their counterparts in the gauge

of (1.1) and (1.2), but they lead to the same relations among the 1pi self-energy amplitudes

given by (2.5) and (3.3).

using (2.5) and (3.3), we get the following expressions for the propagators:

dw w = daa = dzz =

1
k2 ,

d+ =

daz = 0 ,
k2  w m 2
0  w w w
(k2)2(1  +/k2)

,

(4.1a)

(4.1b)

(4.1c)

(4.1d)

(4.1e)

(4.1f )

(4.1g)

we see that the double pole for the 2 2 mixing matrix remains located at k2 = 0. thus the
mixing of the unphysical higgs mesons with the longitudinal gauge mesons does not change

the massless nature of these particles as a result of the ward identities.

although the double pole is located at k2 = 0, not innity, the propagators still cannot

be made nite by renormalizations. to see this, we rst note that (4.1a) says that there

are no radiative corrections to the propagators in (4.1a), which are already nite without

being divided by wavefunction renormalization constants. indeed, if we were to divide the

longitudinal a or the longitudinal z (or their rotated elds) by wavefunction renormalization

constants which have ultraviolet divergences, the resulting renormalized propagators for these

elds would be ultraviolet divergent. thus the longitudinal a and the longitudinal z need

no renormalizations, and the only elds which we may renormalize are the higgs elds. but

it is not possible to make the propagators nite by doing so. to see this, let the wavefunction

renormalization constant for  be z. then gw  multiplied by qz and g+ multiplied

by z are the renormalized propagators. if both renormalized propagators are nite, so is

the ratio m 2

0 d+/d2

w . but this ratio is

(k2)2"

k2

0 + w w (k2)  w# .

m  2

(4.2)

let us examine this expression in the limit of k2  0. as we have mentioned, the 1pi
self-energy amplitude in this limit for the longitudinal vector meson is the same as that for

the transverse vector. thus the rst term inside the bracket in (4.2) is equal to k2 times

the propagator of the tranverse w at zero momentum, and is ultraviolet divergent. thus

the standard model in the gauge of (1.3) is not renormalizable. as before, the diculty of

renormalization disappears as we set all alphas to zero. indeed, (4.1c) and (4.1d) are in the

same forms as (2.13a) and (3.10) as we set all alphas to zero.

finally, the ward-takahashi identities (e.2b), and (e.3c)(e.3f) enable us to express the

ghost propagators as

d+(k2) =

(4.3a)

note that the ghost propagators in (4.3) are identical in form with the corresponding ones

in (3.7) if we set z to zero, and can be renormalized for the same reason as before.

5. conclusion

recognizing that the ward-takahashi identities provide constraints on the divergences

among amplitudes in the theory, people have accepted, ever since the appearance of the

pioneering works of thooft and veltman [5,6], that the brst invariance of the standard

model guarantees the renormalizability of the quantum theory of the model in the alpha

gauge.

in the standard model, there are twelve ward-takahashi identities for the two-point

functions. four of these identities lead to four relations satised by the nine 1pi self-energy

amplitudes of the unphysical mesons, leaving ve of the 1pi self-energy amplitudes indepen-

dent. five other ward-takahashi identities relate the ve independent ghost propagators

and three 3-point functions to these same 1pi self-energy amplitudes. the last three ward-

takahashi identities set the mass scale of the physical vector mesons. for example, the

ward-takahashi identity (b.6) leads to a relation between the w -mass and the quantum

vacuum expectation of the higgs meson, as will be discussed in more details in another pa-

per. we shall only point out here that, in the gauge of (1.1) and (1.2), with no conditions

of subtraction available for the position of the double pole in the unphysical propagators,

there is nothing to prevent it from being innite.

over a year ago, we rst realized that, in the abelian gauge eld theory with higgs

mesons, with a gauge xing term of the form of (1.2), one of the ward-takahashi identities
enforces the isolated singularity of the propagators in the 2  2 mixing matrix in this theory
to be a double pole. explicit perturbative calculations on the position of this double pole

veried that the position of this pole is ultraviolet divergent. thus the abelian gauge eld

theory with higgs mesons is not renormalizable in the alpha gauge.

13

since then we have shown that all these are also true in the standard model, both for the
2 2 mixing matrix and for the 3 3 mixing matrix for v0 the classical vacuum value or the
quantum vacuum value. we have also extended the treatment to the alpha gauge with the

gauge xing terms of (1.3). while the double pole in this case is at k2 = 0, not innity, the

propagators cannot be rendered nite with wavefunction renormalizations.

there have been many proofs [7,8,9,10] demonstrating that gauge eld theories with

symmetry breaking in general, and the standard model in particular, are renormalizable

in the alpha gauge.

instead of addressing everyone of them in details, we would like to

make the following comment. the considerations of renormalizability of quantum gauge

eld theories with symmetry breaking dier from those without symmetry breaking.

in

the former theories, the unphysical higgs mesons mix with the longitudinal component of

the associated gauge meson.

it is untenable to argue that since the latter theories are

renormalizable, so are the former theories.

to illustrate this point, let us consider the simple example of scalar qed in which the

photon couples with a complex scalar eld  which has a real and positive bare mass 0,

and the vacuum symmetry is not broken. to quantize this theory, let us choose the gauge

xing term

1
2



(a  m2)2

(5.1)

where 2 is the imaginary part of  and m is an introduced parameter. the gauge xing term

for scalar qed is traditionally chosen to be the one in (5.1) with m equal to zero, but there

is nothing to forbid us from choosing a non-zero m provided that we add the corresponding

ghost terms to make the eective lagrangian invariant under brst variations. while the

green functions for a non-zero m are dierent from those with m equal to zero, the physical

scattering amplitudes remain the same.

the gauge xing term in (5.1) contains a term which mixes the longitudinal a with .

this changes the tree amplitudes but not any of the 1pi amplitudes of the propagators.

thus we have

aa = a2 = 0

14

and the 2  2 mixing matrix for the propagators of a and 2 is equal to the inverse of




ik2/
km i(k2  2

km
0  m 2  )

.




thus this mixing matrix is equal to

i(k2  2

0  m 2  ) km
km

ik2





 .

(2)

k2(k2  2

0  )

we see from (5.2) that the propagators are not renormalizable for a nite and non-zero m.

in order that the theory is renormalizable, a non-zero m must be equal to a nite number

times 1/qz, where z is the wavefunction renormalization constant for the 2-eld.

in the standard model there is no such freedom of choosing m, and the unphysical prop-

agators are not renormalizable in the alpha gauge. since graphs of unphysical propagators

may appear as subgraphs in the graphs of other green functions, green functions in the

standard model are generally not renormalizable.

the only gauge in which the diculty of renormalization does not appear is the landau

gauge, which is obtained from the alpha gauge by setting alpha to zero. one of the reasons for

this is that, as all alpha are set to zero, many propagators vanish and need no renormalization.

this does not necessarily mean that the standard model is renormalizable in landau

gauge. but if it is, and if physical (and on-shell) scattering amplitudes are gauge invari-

ant, these amplitudes will be nite in the alpha gauge once they are nite in the landau

gauge. in a practical calculation of physical scattering amplitudes, the innities from the

green functions cancel one another, provided that they are properly regularized and the

procedures of subtractions and normalization as emphasized by bonneau [11] are properly

performed. on the other hand, o-shell green functions are dependent on alpha, and are

not renormalizable in the alpha gauge. in a gauge eld theory with symmetry breaking, one

must make a distinction between the renormalizability of the green functions and that of

the physical scattering amplitudes.

appendix d

equating the matrix in (3.1) to the inverse of the matrix in (3.2), we express the propa-

gators in (3.1) by their 1pi amplitudes. with the propagators expressed in such forms, we

require them to satisfy the ward-takahashi identity (c.3). we get

note the resemblance of (d.3) and (d.5) with (2.5).

identities in this gauge to determine relations among the 1pi self-energy amplitudes. we

then simplify the expressions for these propagators by the use of these relations.

the inverse of the matrix above is

let us impose (e.2a) on the rst diagonal matrix element of the inverse of (e.6). we get, as

in the alpha gauge of (1.1), the condition (2.5).

with (2.5), we reduce the denominator of the matrix in (e.5) into

next we turn to the 3  3 mixing matrix for the longitudinal a, the longitudinal z, and

(e.11c)

the equations in (e.11) are the same as those in (3.3). thus the relations among the 1pi

amplitudes in the pure alpha gauge dened by the gauge xing terms of (1.3) are the same

as those in the alpha gauge dened by the gauge xing terms of (1.2) and (1.3).

with (e.11), we nd that the determinant of the matrix in (e.10) is equal to
