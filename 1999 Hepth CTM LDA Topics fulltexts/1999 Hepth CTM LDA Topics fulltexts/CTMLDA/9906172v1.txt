it has recently been claimed that the inclusion of a pauli term in (2+1) dimensions gives rise
to a new type of anomalous spin term. the form of that term is shown to contradict the structure
relations for the inhomogeneous lorentz group.

in 1984 [1] it was shown that it is possible to formulate a pure chern-simons gauge theory. that theory was
found to have the peculiar feature that the commutator of the angular momentum operator l with the fundamental
charge eld has an anomalous term (i.e., a fractional spin) proportional to to the product of that eld with the charge
operator q. more recently it has been claimed [2] that if a pauli-type coupling is included, an additional anomalous
spin term is induced. specically, it is asserted that the commutator of l with the scalar charge eld  has the form

[l, (y)] = i(y  )(y) 

e2
2

q(y) + i

g
2

y  e(y)

where e, g, and  are constants. it is shown here that such a term is inconsistent with the underlying poincare algebra
in (2+1) dimensions.

the proof of this result follows immediately upon inserting the above equation between the operators eipa and

eipa where a is an arbitrary two-vector. using the result

a(x + a) = eipaa(x)eipa

for an arbitrary operator a together with the structure relation

[l, p i] = iijpj,

this is seen to yield

[l, (y)] = i(y  )(y) 

e2
2

q(y) + i

g

(y  a)  e(y)

upon letting y  y  a. this leads to the immediate result that the relation claimed in ref. 2 cannot be valid for
nonzero g.
