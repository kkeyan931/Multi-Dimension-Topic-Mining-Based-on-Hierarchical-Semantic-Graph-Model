(7) (8) (9) important point noted later discussion that, upon diagonalizing matrix, eq.(8), n-th harmonic oscillator eigenstate y9 always accompanied linear combi- nation (n + 1)-th (n 1)-th eigenstates y1,2s. thus, y1, y2 even functions y9 odd one, vice versa. fermionic coordinates, interpretation goes (except wave functions grassmannian) uctuation spectrum grouped pair, consequence following fact projected = 12 membrane conguration. half 2 f(n;

(14) terms rst line contribution even modes 1, 2, automatically projects odd modes 9 time, even modes 3, , 8. likewise, second line contributions even odd modes (1 )a, respectively. short distance, r 0, potential, eq.(14), complex-valued, seen = 0 contribution rst term summand. signals tachyonic instability m2 located near o8-orientifold. explore r long distance behavior, convenient reexpress potential, eq.(14), integral representation, using identity: = 1 2 z 0 ds s3/2 eas. one nds vso(r) = 4r 4 z ds s3/2 er2se2cs sinh4(cs) sinh(4cs) (15) (16) . expanding integrand small s, convergent expansion limit consid- eration, one obtains long-distance behavior static potential m2 -o8 orientifold 7 conguration: vso(r) = +4r 3c3 4r5 + o(cid:18) 1 r7(cid:19) , (r ). (17) potential attractive. thus conclude that, near o8 orientifold, m2 attracted orientifold plane eventually becomes tachyonic conguration. 4.3 m2 o8+ orientifold next turn o8+ orientifold corresponding usp chan-paton gauge bundle. according projection rules, one need keep odd modes eq.(7) eq.(9), even odd modes eqs.(10,11), respectively. again, infer stability m2 conguration conveniently locating dis- tance r/2 orientifold measure static potential: vusp(r) = xm=1(cid:18)qr2 + 2c(4m 3) +qr2 + 2c(4m + 1) + 6qr2 + 2c(4m 1) 2qr2 + 2c(4m) 4qr2 + 2c(4m 2) 2qr2 + 2c(4m 4)(cid:19) . (18) signicantly, one notes tachyon mode eq.(9) (the n = 0 mode 2 ||) completely projected background o8+-orientifold. static potential m2 well-dened r 0. long distance, r , using integral representation, one nds: s3/2 er2se2cs sinh4(cs) vusp(r) = 4r sinh(4cs) ds . 4 z 0 (19) (20) expanding integran small s, one obtains: vusp(r) = 4r 3c3 4r5 + o( 1 r7 ) , indicating repulsive long-range force. thus, conclude m2 near o8+-orientifold exhibits stable non-bps conguration. 4.4 compact m1/z2 orientifolds twisted sector states discussion far, implicitly assumed covering space orientifold noncompact. compact, say, = s1/z2, order cancel anomalous uxes carried orientifolds, one needs introduce twisted sector m(atrix) theory. s1/z2, t5/z2 t9/z2 cases, complete spectrum twisted sector determined 8 previously . one may inquire conclusion previous subsections non- bps m2 m(atrix) orientifolds would modied case covering space compact, viz. eects twisted sector spectrum included. s1/z2, consistency condition anomalous ux gauge anomaly cancellations xes uniquely two orientifolds (located two diagonal points s1 covering space) o8 ones twisted sector consists eight supersymmetry singlet fermions orientifold. twisted sector fermions, transform fundamental representation so(2n) chan-paton gauge bundle couples x 9 minimally. inferring x 9 eq.(2), twisted sector fermions, uctuation energy spectrum r/2, independent analog harmonic oscillator excitation level n 4. o-diagonal i, submatrices untwisted sector (n n) degrees freedom overall. however, uctuation mode, n-fold degeneracy, corresponding center mass motion analog two-particle harmonic oscillator system. projecting degeneracy out, uctuation energy spectrum i, eectively n-fold degeneracy only. twisted sector fermions belong fundamental representation chan-paton gauge bundle, uctuation energy spectrum n-fold degenerate, untwisted sector. implies leading-order, linear potential m2 o8, eq.(16), cancelled exactly contribution twisted sector fermions, resulting attractive long-range potential. another possibility two orientifolds s1/z2 xed points o8 o8+ type ones, respectively. case, anomalous ux orientifold cancels other, need introduce twisted sector. case, m2 appears stable state locally near o8+ orientifold, transported near o8 orientifold, m2 ought exhibit tachyonic instability. thus, case, stability m2 would depend, complicated way, volume s1/z2 (viz. distance o8+ o8) location r/2 m2 . 4.5 summary m2 stable, non-bps conguration located o8+ orientifold, exhibit tachyonic instability located o8 orientifold. 4 twisted sector fermion displaced locations mi, uctuation spectrum changed {r/2+mi} accordingly. 9 5 m2 m(atrix) o4-orientifold section, extend analysis section 3 m2 located o4-orientifold m(atrix) theory. 5.1 m2 versus o4-orientifold consider m2 extended parallel o4-orientifold. o4-orientifold spans r4,1 = (t, x 1, , x 4) m2 stretched along (x 1, x 2) directions distance r/2 along x 9 direction. thus, covering space viewpoint, conguration given eq.(2), viz. m2 - m2 dipole separated distance r. again, m2 -o4 conguration bps state breaks thirty-two supersymmetries m(atrix) theory. analyze stability m2 o4 orientifold explicitly following analysis o8 orientifold case. 5.2 m2 o4 orientifold o4 orientifold corresponding chan-paton gauge bundle zero-brane partons, orientifold projection rules, one keeps even modes 1, , 4, odd modes 5, , 9, even / odd modes chiral sector as. potential m2 -o4 readily obtained summing modes left orientifold projection: vso(r) = xm=1(cid:18)(cid:26)qr2 + 2c(4m 5) +qr2 + 2c(4m 1)(cid:27) +(cid:26)2qr2 + 2c(4m 3) + 4qr2 + 2c(4m 1)(cid:27) 2qr2 + 2c(4m) 4qr2 + 2c(4m 2) 2qr2 + 2c(4m 4)(cid:19) .
