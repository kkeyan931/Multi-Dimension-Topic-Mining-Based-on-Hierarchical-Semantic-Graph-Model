abstract

the bps method is used to nd bps solutions of the worldvolume theory of a d5-
brane in the near horizon geometry of a d3-brane. the bps bound is interpreted
in terms of the maximally extended d5 worldvolume supersymmetry algebra in
the corresponding curved background, which is osp(1|16). this algebra is an
extension of the worldvolume superalgebra osp(4|4). the analysis is generalized
to the non-near horizon case.

1 introduction

worldvolume techniques have been a powerful tool in analyzing congurations of intersecting
d-branes [1, 2] (and m-branes [3]). in [1, 2] a fundamental string ending on a d-brane was
analyzed from the point of view of the d-brane worldvolume theory. that theory was shown
to admit solutions allowing an interpretation as fundamental strings ending on the brane.
this result can be understood in terms of central charges1 appearing in the maximally
extended worldvolume supersymmetry algebra [7].
in [8] these charges were interpreted
along the lines of [9]. the hamiltonian density was written as a sum of squares, such that
putting one of the squares equal to zero yields a rst order dierential equation implying
the equations of motion.

this worldvolume analysis was performed for branes in a at background. the aim of
the present paper is to extend the method to the case of a brane in the background produced
by another brane. we have chosen the example of a d5-brane in the background of n d3-
branes, since this conguration is physically particularly interesting.
in the near horizon
limit of the d3-brane geometry it is related to the baryon vertex in n = 4, d = 4 sym
[10, 11]. in the non-near horizon case it is relevant for the hanany-witten eect [12, 13].
two main tools are used in the analysis. first, the hamiltonian formalism is adopted
to rederive the bps equations of [11] and [13] from a bosonic point of view. second, this
analysis is shown to t in the description based on worldvolume superalgebras.

section 2 contains a review of the worldvolume analysis of a d5-brane in a at back-
ground. in section 3 we write the hamiltonian density as a sum of squares along the lines
of [8], derive a bps bound and interpret its physical meaning. section 4 deals with the
worldvolume superalgebra approach, showing how the charges t in extended worldvolume
algebras. the conclusions are presented in section 5. a rst appendix contains some nota-
tions. a second one gives the group theoretical structure of the worldvolume superalgebras
and illustrates relations between such superalgebras.

2 bps method for d-branes in a flat background

in this section we will review the main points of the bps method for d-branes in a at
background [7, 8]. the relation between the bps bounds and the charges occurring in the
worldvolume supersymmetry algebra will be stressed. we will work with the particular case
of a d5-brane, since in the next section we will be interested in extending this analysis to a
d5-brane in a non-trivial background.

let us thus consider a d5-brane in a at background. the action is given by

s = t5z d5+1q det(g + f ) ,

(2.1)

where t5 = 1/gs (2 )5 3 is the d5-brane tension (from now onwards, we set t5  1), g is
the induced metric and f = da is the eld strength of the born-infeld (bi) gauge vector a.
let us x the static gauge

x 0 = 0 ,

x 4 = 1, . . . , x 8 = 5

(2.2)

1 we denote by central charges the bosonic charges that appear in the right hand side of the anticommu-
tator of the fermionic generators apart from the worldvolume coordinate transformations and r-symmetry
generators. the terminology originates from charges allowed in 4 dimensional extended supersymmetry
by [4], where these charges are really central. the anticommutator of the supersymmetries can contain
analogous charges that do not commute with the lorentz algebra and/or the r-symmetry [5, 6].

corresponding to a brane extending (asymptotically) along directions 45678.

now let us look for spike-like static worldvolume solutions describing a fundamental
string attached to the d5. we consider congurations with only one scalar excited and with
purely electric bi eld:

x 1 = x 2 = x 3 = 0 ,

~a  (a4, . . . , a8) = ~a(0) .
(2.3)
from the 10d space-time point of view one might represent the conguration we are looking
for, by the following array:

x 9 = x() ,

at = at() ,

d5 :
f 1 :

4 5 6 7 8

at background

(2.4)

since we are interested in bounds on the energy for these congurations, it is useful to pass to
the hamiltonian formalism. let us denote the canonically conjugate momenta associated to
x and ~a by p and ~ respectively. the canonical phase-space lagrangian density is dened
by

l =

~a  ~ + x p  l = ~e  ~ + x p  l  at ~  ~ ,

~a  ~at, and in the last step we have

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

 at ~   .

where l is the original lagrangian density, ~e =
integrated ~at  ~ by parts. in hamiltonian form l is given by
+(cid:16)~  ~x(cid:17)2

l = r(cid:16)1 + (~x)2(cid:17) (1 + p 2) + ~

2

the rst term is the desired expression for the energy density

h = r(cid:16)1 + (~x)2(cid:17) (1 + p 2) + ~

2

+(cid:16)~  ~x(cid:17)2

,

whereas the second term yields the gauss law (constraint)

for static congurations, p = 0, the hamiltonian reduces to [8]

~  ~ = 0 .

h = r(cid:16)1  ~x  ~(cid:17)2

+(cid:16)~x  ~(cid:17)2

.

in order to get a bound for the energy from the previous expression we should consider the
vacuum or ground state solution of our at d5-brane and its energy density. the ground
state solution corresponds to x() not being excited and to vanishing bi vector. this
conguration is a solution of the equations of motion and its energy density is egs = 1. hence,
the energy density in (2.7) can be split as h = egs + eren, where eren is the renormalized
energy density of the brane, i.e. the energy density of the brane relative to its ground state.
after this splitting, we obtain a bound for the energy density eren given by

with equality when

eren | ~x  ~ | ,

~x = ~ .

(2.10)

(2.11)

the bound on the density implies the following bound on the renormalized energy:

e = z eren | zel | ,
zel  z

~  ~x ,

(2.12)

where  is the worldspace of the d5-brane.

let us now interpret the physical meaning of zel. because of the gauss law constraint,
solutions of (2.11) correspond to solutions of 2x = 0. isolated singularities of x are the
bions found in [1, 2]:

x =

q

v(4)r3 ;

r2 = (cid:16)1(cid:17)2

+ . . . +(cid:16)5(cid:17)2

;

v(4) =

82
3

,

(2.13)

corresponding to a charge q at the origin. this charge at the origin is the source of the bi
vector.2 the gauss law is only valid away from the singularity r = 0, and thus

zel = q lim
r0

x(r) ,

(2.14)

where x(r) represents the height of the spike at a distance r from the origin. the charge
q should be quantized in the quantum theory (see e.g. [1]). setting it equal to its minimum
value and restoring the factor t5 we nally nd

zel = tf lim
r0

x(r) ,

(2.15)

where tf = 1/2   is the tension of a fundamental string. this makes clear the interpreta-
tion of zel as the energy of a fundamental string attached to the d5-brane.

now let us show how zel appears as a central charge in the worldvolume supersym-
metry algebra of the d5-brane.
in order to construct this algebra it is useful to study
rst which bosonic background isometries preserve the vacuum solution of the d5. the
worldvolume part of these symmetries is iso(5, 1) and the r-symmetry part is given by
so(4) = su(2)  su(2). the supersymmetry generators transform in the spinor represen-
 and q
tation of this symmetry algebra, so that they can be denoted as qi
, where  = 1 . . . 4
and i, = 1, 2. the maximally extended superalgebra3 is given by [14]:

(2.16)

this algebra is the semi-direct sum of a contraction of osp(1|16) with the lorentz and
r-symmetry algebras; see appendix b for a related discussion.
the charge y i is a vector of the r-symmetry group so(4). interpreting this group as
the rotation group of the four-dimensional space transverse to the d5 [7], we see that y i
selects a direction in this transverse space, as a string ending on the d5 does. hence the

2the initial generic conguration had no source for the bi vector. the case of a d5 in the background
of a d3 studied in the next section will be dierent since for a generic conguration there is a source for the
bi vector due to the wess-zumino term.

3in this algebra one allows the most general anticommutator of the supersymmetries. this corresponds
to extending the original symmetry algebra of the d5-brane, which we call the worldvolume algebra, to a
larger one encoding all bps intersections.

charge y i is associated to fundamental strings ending on the d5-brane. its expression in
terms of the elds of the d5-brane is4

y m = z

~  ~x

m

,

(2.17)

where x m is a vector in the transverse space to the d5 brane, i.e. along the directions 1239.
thus we recognize zel as the central charge y i appearing in the worldvolume supersymmetry
algebra (in our expression (2.12) the direction m = 9 has been chosen out of four equivalent
ones). the other charges occurring in the algebra are also interpreted as intersections of
branes along the lines of [7, 14].

3 the d5 in the d3 background: hamiltonian analysis

in this section we will derive a bps bound on the energy of a d5-brane in the background
geometry of a stack of n d3-branes, by showing that it is bounded from below by a topo-
logical quantity. let us thus begin by describing the d3 background. the ten-dimensional
metric is

ds2

(10) = h 1/2dx 2

k + h 1/2(cid:16)dr2 + r2d2

(5)(cid:17) .

here xk = (x 0, x 1, x 2, x 3) are cartesian coordinates on e(1,3) and d2
(5) is the line element
on a unit ve-sphere, which we take to be parametrized by standard angular coordinates
, i, i = 1, . . . , 4, where i are coordinates on a four-sphere. thus we have

(3.1)

(3.3)

d2

(5) = d2 + sin2  d2

(4) .

(3.2)

the coordinate r parametrizes the radial distance to the branes, so r, , and i are spherical
coordinates on the six-dimensional space transverse to the branes. the harmonic function
appearing above is

h = a +

r4
r4 .

here a = 0 describes the near-horizon geometry ads5  s5, whereas a = 1 describes an
asymptotically at space-time. the parameter r measures the gravitational size of the
stack of branes, and in the case a = 0 precisely coincides with the radius of both ads5 and
s5. on top of the metric, the supergravity solution describing the d3-branes is characterized
by a non-vanishing ramond-ramond (rr) 5-form eld strength

g(5) = h 2 h  dx 0  dx 1  dx 2  dx 3  dr + 4 r4 (5) ;
(5) = sin4  d  (4) ,

(3.4)
(3.5)

where (n) is the volume form on a unit n-sphere and h   rh. now let us consider a
d5-brane coupled to the above background. it will be described by the action

s = t5z

d6q det(g + f ) + t5z

a  g(5) .

(3.6)

note that the rr eld acts as source for the worldvolume gauge eld a through its coupling
in the wess-zumino term above. for all the congurations we will consider, only the second
term in (3.4) will contribute to this coupling. the inclusion of this term is therefore essential
for the correct treatment of such congurations.

4this expression should be obtainable from the explicit form of the supercharges, which one could get

via noethers theorem as in [15].

we are interested in passing to the hamiltonian formalism in order to derive a bound
on the energy. let us rst of all x the static gauge by choosing  = {, i; i = 1, . . . , 4} as
coordinates on the d5-brane worldvolume and by identifying

x 0 = t ,

 =  ,

i = i .

(3.7)

since we will only be interested in congurations which preserve the so(5) symmetry which
rotates the i = i coordinates, we also restrict ourselves to the following type of congu-
rations:

x 1 = x 2 = x 3 = 0 ,

r = r(t, ) ,

at = at(t, ) ,

a = a(t, ) ,

ai = 0 .

under these conditions, the d5 action reduces to

s = t5 v(4) z dt d sin4  (cid:20)h r4qr2 + r2  h r2 r2  e2 + 4 r4 at(cid:21) ,

(3.8)

(3.9)

where r  tr , r  r , e  f0 and v(4) = 8 2/3 is the volume of a unit four-sphere.
from now on we will set t5 v(4)  1. the canonical momenta p and  conjugate to the
elds r and a in the above action are

p

=

h 2 r6 r

r2 + r2  h r2 r2  e2

h r4 e

= sin4 

r2 + r2  h r2 r2  e2

.

(3.10)

the canonical phase-space lagrangian density is dened by

l = a  + r p  l = e  + r p  l  at  ,

(3.11)

where in the last step we have integrated a
can rewrite l in the hamiltonian form

t  by parts. inverting the relations (3.10) one

l = vuut(cid:16)r2 + r2(cid:17)  p 2

h r2 + 2 + 2! + at (cid:16)  4 r4 sin4 (cid:17) ,

where

the rst term is just the desired energy density

  h r4 sin4  .

h = vuut(cid:16)r2 + r2(cid:17)  p 2

h r2 + 2 + 2! ,

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)

whereas the second term yields the modied gauss law  = 4 r4 sin4 . remark that
in the at background case we had as gauss law ~ ~ = 0, while here we have a source term,
a direct consequence of the wess-zumino coupling to g(5) in the d5-brane action. this is
the dierence referred to in footnote 2.

the gauss law constraint is solved by [13]

(, ) =

1
2

r4 h3 (   ) + 3 sin  cos  + 2 sin3  cos i

,

(3.15)

where  is an integration parameter. its meaning will become clear below (see also [13]).
we thus use the solution of the gauss law constraint, but do not use the eld equation for
r(), which will rather be implied by bps conditions.

we further consider static congurations. the energy density reduces to

h = r(cid:16)r2 + r2(cid:17) (2 + 2) .

(3.16)

the rst key observation to prove the existence of a bps bound on the energy of the d5

is that the above expression can be rewritten as

where

h = szel

2 + r2 ( cos    sin )2 (cid:18)r

r  f(cid:19)2

zel  r ( cos    sin )  1 +

r
r

f! ,

f (a, ; r, ) 

(a, r, ) sin  + (, ) cos 
(a, r, ) cos   (, ) sin 

.

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)

the function r() has in general a limited range in  from i to f . the second key observation
is that the integral

zel  z f

i

d zel

(3.20)

is topological, as we will show below. this implies the desired bps bound on the d5 energy,
namely

eren + egs  z f

i

d h  |zel|

,

through the following two inequalities

eren + egs = z f

i

d h  z f

i

d |zel|  |zel| .

(3.21)

(3.22)

above, egs is the ground state or vacuum energy of the d5-brane in the d3 background,
and eren is the renormalized energy of a conguration, i.e. the energy relative to this ground
state. of course, egs might be a divergent quantity; only energies relative to it are physical.
we will come back to this issue below.

the bps bound (3.21) is saturated if and only if both inequalities above are. saturation
of the rst one5 yields a rst order dierential equation on the d5 embedding r(), namely

r
r

= f .

(3.23)

this equation is valid for both the near-horizon case and the asymptotically at one (note
that the function f is dierent for the two cases). in the former case, it was derived in [11]
by imposing the preservation of some fraction of global worldvolume supersymmetry. for
the latter case, it was proposed in [13] as a plausible generalization of the result in [11] and
shown to imply the equations of motion of the d5. in our approach, both cases can be dealt
with at once, and in both of them the bps equation emerges from a bound on the d5 energy.
5if r ( cos    sin ) = 0, the introduction of f in (3.17) is not allowed. in this case, saturation of the
bps bound implies that the numerator of f is zero too, leading to (, ) = (a, r, ) = 0, which implies
 = 0 or  = , and can thus be neglected.

on top of (3.23), we still have to impose saturation of the second inequality in (3.22) to
saturate the energy bound (3.21). such inequality is saturated when zel does not change
sign in the integration region [i, f ]. this condition determines the possible values of i and
f (for bps solutions), where boundary conditions for r should be supplemented. when
(3.23) holds, the sign of zel is determined by the sign of
3
 cos    sin  = a r4 sin4  cos  +
2

r4 sin  () ,

(3.24)

where the function

()       sin  cos 

(3.25)
is monotonically increasing for   [0, ].6 in [13] the restriction was made to   [0, 1]. we
make the same restriction in the main text.7 in this case,  changes sign precisely once in
this interval at 0 such that (0) = 0. therefore, in the case a = 0, the second inequality
in (3.22) is saturated if

or

i = 0 ,

f = 0

i = 0 ,

f =  .

(3.26)

(3.27)

these two possibilities coincide with those found in [13], where they were determined by
explicitly solving the bps equation (3.23).

although the procedure is conceptually the same, in the case a = 1 we cannot determine
from this analysis the possible range of . to determine the sign of (3.24) we would need
the explicit form of the solution r(). these solutions were studied in [13] only numerically
(in the case a = 1): no analytic solution was found.

let us come back to the topological nature of zel. since the density zel can be rewritten

as a total derivative,8

r ( cos    sin ) 1 +

it follows that

(3.28)

(3.29)

depends only on the boundary conditions r(i) and r(f ). this means that, for xed values
of r(i) and r(f ), zel is invariant under local variations of the elds.
it is in this sense
that it is a topological quantity. congurations saturating the bound (3.21) minimize the
energy for xed boundary conditions, and therefore they automatically solve the equations
of motion.

for a = 1, the second term is precisely the ground state energy of the d5.
consider an innite planar d5-brane intersecting the stack of d3-branes at a point

(3.30)

6recall that 0  i  f   since we identied  with , one of the angular coordinates on the s 5.
7if one were to consider solutions with  outside this range,  would have a denite sign, so that, for
a = 0, the solution r() can extend over the whole interval [0, ], developing spikes both at  = 0 and  = .
8only the gauss law solution (3.15) has to be used to deduce (3.28). neither the eld equation for r()

nor the bps condition (3.23) are needed.

the d5 worldspace  spans a ve-dimensional hyperplane in the transverse space to the d3-
branes, which we can take as the  = /2 hyperplane. the energy of such a conguration
is

which can be seen to agree with the second term in (3.29) by making use of the form of the
solutions found in [13].

in the case a = 0, the second term in (3.29) vanishes for all the solutions of (3.23) (again,
see [13]). we will see below that the rst term in (3.29) has a clear physical interpretation
not associated with any ground state energy, so we conclude that the d5 ground state for
a = 0 is such that its energy vanishes. we interpret this fact in the following way. let us
understand the ground state of the d5 in the near horizon geometry of the d3-branes as a
limit of the d5 ground state in the full d3 geometry. the latter is represented by the array
(3.30). one can think of it as an intersection of orthogonal d5 and d3 branes in a point, but
this is not necessarily the case: since it is a bps conguration, both kinds of branes can be
separated along the 9th direction while preserving the bps character. hence, generically, in
the full d3 geometry, the d5 in its ground state does not intersect the d3-branes. taking
the near horizon limit means zooming up the region close to the latter. if the d5 was placed
at a certain nite distance along x 9, then it will disappear to innity when one focuses on
regions arbitrarily close to the d3-branes. in this sense, its ground state energy in the full
geometry will not show up after taking the near horizon limit.

the d5 ground state we end up with taking this limit can be identied with the  = 1
conguration found in [13]. the reason is that congurations with  6= 1 in [13] represent
a d5-brane innitely far away from the d3-branes, connected to them by (1  ) n strings.
the limit   1 can thus be interpreted as the limit in which only the d5 in its ground
state at innity remains. this remark is important because although in the strict limit the
d5 disappears, in taking such a limit there is always a selected direction, namely x 9. this
will be essential in the next section.

having identied egs for both the a = 0 and the a = 1 cases, we can rewrite the bound

(3.21) as

eren  |z9| ,

z9  [ r cos ]f

i

(3.32)

the physical meaning of z9 can (again) be understood by evaluating it for the solutions of
(3.23). restoring the factor t5 v(4) the result is9

z9 = (1  ) n tf l ,

(3.33)

where l  r(f ) for a = 0 and l  r(f ) cos(f ) for a = 1. the above expression claries
the physical interpretation of z9. it is the energy of (1 ) n fundamental strings of length
l and tension tf joining together the d5 and the d3-branes. from the ten-dimensional
space-time point of view this corresponds to the triple intersection

d3 : 1 2 3
d5 :
f 1 :

4 5 6 7 8

background
worldvolume
bps solution.

9

(3.34)

in our analysis, the d3 is the background and the f1 plays the role of a soliton of the d5
worldvolume theory.10

9in the case a = 0,  = 1 (see [13]) there is an additional contribution to z9 given by (i) r(i). we
neglect it because it is nite, whereas z9 is divergent. it is precisely the form of this divergence that we
would like to interpret.

10triple intersection from the point of view of worldvolume theories have been studied in [7], see also [16].

we have chosen the name z9 because of the direction in which the string stretches. in
the case a = 0, the d5 is innitely far away from the d3-branes, so l is divergent. in the
case a = 1, the d5 is asymptotically a at hyperplane and l coincides with its distance to
the point r = 0, where the d3-branes are.

the solutions of the bps equation (3.23) are thus the d5 worldvolume description (spike-
like solutions) of the conguration (3.34). in the next section we will provide further evidence
in favor of the interpretation of z9 as a charge associated to the ending of fundamental strings
on the d5 worldvolume from its appearance as a central charge in the d5 worldvolume
supersymmetry algebra.

4 algebras

in the previous section we have understood the bps equation (3.23) from a bosonic point of
view. now we will show that the charge z9, which sets the bound (3.32), is a central charge
in the worldvolume supersymmetry algebra of the d5 in the d3 background. to do so, we
will determine this algebra. the cases a = 0 and a = 1 will be treated separately, since the
results are dierent. however, the procedure to determine the algebra is conceptually the
same, and in principle applies to any brane in any curved background.

the starting point is to identify the ground state conguration of the brane in the given
background. two remarks are in order here. first, one should choose it according to
which excited congurations one would like to study. from a space-time point of view, this
corresponds to which type of triple intersections one would like to consider. for instance,
suppose instead of (3.34) we had been interested in studying the intersection

then the vacuum conguration would have consisted of an static innite planar d5-brane in-
tersecting the stack of d3-branes in a 2-brane. the bps-solution would have been described
by the scalar x 1 and an excited bi gauge eld.

second, the starting point is purely bosonic, since one need only consider a bosonic

background.

next, one determines which isometries of the background preserve the ground state con-
guration; these isometries give rise to linearly realized symmetries of the brane worldvolume
theory [17]: they constitute the worldvolume bosonic symmetry algebra. part of them are
associated to worldvolume coordinate transformations and part of them to r-symmetry.

to determine the whole worldvolume supersymmetry algebra, one rst imposes that the
supersymmetry generators are in the (fundamental) spinorial representation of the algebra
of worldvolume coordinate transformations. moreover, they should be in a representation
of the r-symmetry algebra. that is usually sucient to x the number of supercharges
of the worldvolume supersymmetry algebra.
in the case a = 0 one can make use of the
classication of nahm [18] of super-ads or superconformal algebras11.

to denitely x this algebra, only the anticommutator of these supercharges needs still
to be determined. this is done by allowing all the original bosonic generators not forbidden
by jacobi identities to occur.

11in principle, the supersymmetry generators are determined from the killing spinors of the above-
mentioned bosonic ground state conguration. one could have started from the whole isometry superalgebra
of the (super)background and have determined which of these superisometries preserve the ground state of
the brane.

the algebra constructed this way, is what we call the worldvolume supersymmetry algebra.
the only bosonic generators it contains, are those originating from bosonic isometries of the
background.

the nal step in the procedure is to enlarge this algebra along the lines of [7] to what
we will call the maximally extended worldvolume supersymmetry algebra. this is done by
constructing the most general anticommutator of the supersymmetry generators allowed by
symmetry by adding all possible central extensions (see footnote 1). the algebra obtained
in this way is the one which encodes all the bps intersections. such intersections involve
the brane whose worldvolume theory we are considering, the branes creating the background
and a third one. the latter is the one associated to the central charges we have enlarged the
worldvolume algebra with.

note that this procedure does not completely x the superalgebra yet, because so far one
has not determined the commutators of the central charges with the supersymmetry gener-
ators, with the original bosonic generators and with themselves! an explicit computation of
the charges via noether theorem would allow one to x this ambiguity. however, consistency
with jacobi identities xes in many cases this algebra, as we will see below.

in the rest of this section we will illustrate the above general procedure by applying it to
a d5 brane in a d3 background. we will show the appearance of z9, and also interpret the
central charges in the supersymmetry algebra.

4.1 the near-horizon algebra

the rst task is to determine which bosonic isometries of the background preserve the ground
state of the d5-brane. recall that the near-horizon d3 background has as worldvolume su-
peralgebra su(2, 2|4), with bosonic isometry group so(4, 2)  so(6). as already discussed
in section 3, when the d5 is in its ground state its worldspace consists of a hyperplane
extending along directions 45678, located at arbitrary constant values of x i, i = 1, 2, 3, for
instance x i = 0, and at x 9  .
this conguration is preserved by the subgroup so(2, 1)  so(5)  so(3) of the back-
indeed, the condition x 1 = x 2 = x 3 = 0 is preserved by an
ground bosonic isometries.
so(2, 1)  so(3) subgroup of the so(4, 2) factor, and selecting the directions 45678 (or
alternatively, the 9th) breaks the so(6) factor to so(5).
the factors of the symmetry group have the following interpretation: the so(2, 1) con-
i=4(x i)2. the
so(5) contains the d5 worldspace rotations and the so(3) is the group of d3 worldspace
rotations, which is, from the point of view of the d5 brane supersymmetry group, the r-
symmetry.

tains time translations, dilations and boosts for the radial coordinate r = qp9

we have thus identied the bosonic worldvolume symmetry group. the 32 fermionic gen-
erators of the d3 worldvolume algebra are in the representation (4, 4) + (4, 4) of so(4, 2) 
so(6). the intersection with d5 preserves half of them, which are still spinors of so(2, 1),
so(5) as well as so(3). they are thus in the (2, 4, 2) representation of the bosonic world-
volume algebra. using the classication of nahm [18] (for the terminology we use, see the
review in [19]) we can identify therefore the worldvolume superalgebra as osp(4|4), using
the identication so(4) = so(2, 1)  so(3), and usp(4) = so(5). the superalgebra is
in this way completely xed. on the worldvolume half of the supersymmetries are ordi-
nary q-supersymmetries, and the other half are s-supersymmetries, as distinguished by the
eigenvalue of the dilatations. this conformal worldvolume superalgebra originates from the
super-ads symmetry in spacetime [17, 19]. in the latter form the fermionic generators q
and s are unied in a supersymmetry q. in this formulation the anticommutators of these

supersymmetries are

nqi

, qj

o = cr[ij]  1

8

m[]ij ,

(4.2)

where ,  = 1, . . . 4 and ,  = 4, . . . 8 are spinor and vector indices of so(5), respectively.
the i, j = 1, . . . 4 are vector indices of so(4). at the right hand side appear r[ij], the
generators of so(4), and m[], the generators of so(5).
in the conformal notation of
this algebra, the latter appear only in the {q, s} anticommutator. the commutators of the
bosonic algebra and the supersymmetries just reect that the supersymmetries are in the
(2, 4, 2) representation.

having identied the worldvolume algebra as osp(4|4), we now look for the extended
worldvolume algebra. in the spirit of [7] we thus enlarge this algebra by all possible generators
that can appear on the right hand side

nqi

o = cr[ij]  1

(4.3)

where (ij)s indicates that z is symmetric traceless. the jacobi identities do not allow that
the generators u and z commute with the supersymmetries. indeed this is clear e.g. from
the jacobi identity [q, q, z], due to the fact that so(4) and so(5), which rotate the
supersymmetries, appear in the right hand side of (4.3). all the bosonic generators should
thus be part of this simple lie superalgebra which contains the conformal algebra. looking
through the list of all superalgebras [20] (see [19] for a convenient table), one nds that the
extended worldvolume superalgebra is osp(1|16). the right hand side of (4.3) is a symmetric
16  16 matrix mab where a = (i). introducing the symplectic metric ab = cij, one
obtains the algebra

{qa, qb} = mab ,
[mab, mcd] = a(cmd)b + b(cmd)a ,

[mab, qc] = q(ab)c

(4.4)

which thus denes the full algebra. the sp(16) generators are decomposed in (4.3) under
so(2, 1)  so(5)  so(3) as

[(3, 1, 1) + (1, 1, 3)] + (1, 10, 1) + [(3, 5, 1) + (1, 5, 3)] + (3, 10, 3) .

(4.5)

for the splitting of fermionic generators in q and s supersymmetries, we have to write
the so(4) vector index i as (), where  = 1, 2 is a spinor index of so(3) and  indicates
the so(2, 1) = su(1, 1) index. the ordinary (q) supersymmetries are those where this
latter index is +. the anticommutator of these ordinary supersymmetries is then obtained
from (4.3) as

where r, u and z are the (++) parts of r, u and z.

(4.6)

the charge z9 is a component of a 3-vector of so(2, 1). indeed, it is proportional to
the value of r at the singularity, see (3.33), and (r, rt, rt2 + r2/t) is a 3-vector, the one
used to embed ads2 in a 3-dimensional at space (see e.g. (17) in [19] with z = r1 and
x = t). under the remaining factors of the bosonic symmetry group it is invariant, and
thus we conclude that z9 is part of a (3, 1, 1). it can thus be combined with (e, d, k), the
generators of energy, dilatations and lorentz boosts in (t, r), to appear in r. the (3, 1, 1)
part of the generators r[ij] in (4.3) is the triplet of so(2, 1) whose (++) component is12

12in the iib susy algebra in 10 dimensions, the central charge z9 and the energy e occur separated. the
breakdown of this algebra to the q supersymmetry part of the extended worldvolume algebra (4.6) should
lead to this combination.

r = (e  z9) .

(4.7)

(as before, for the denition of e we have put the energy of the vacuum conguration of
the d5 equal to zero.) the fact that this combination e  z9 appears on the right-hand side
of the anticommutator of the supersymmetry generators implies that a conguration with
non-vanishing string charge along the 9-direction (and the other central charges equal to
zero) preserves all 16 supersymmetries if the energy is chosen to saturate the corresponding
bps-bound.

indeed, from a space-time point of view it is easy to see that, having performed the
projections onto supercharges preserving the d3-d5 intersecting (or overlapping) on a point,
one can put an additional string in the remaining direction for free (see, for instance, [13]).
to summarize the main point of this subsection, we have shown that z9 has indeed the
right quantum numbers to be interpreted as a central charge in the worldvolume supersym-
metry algebra of the d5-brane in the near-horizon limit of the d3 background; and that
doing so makes clear that the corresponding bps-solutions (the strings in the 9th-direction)
preserve all 16 supersymmetries of this algebra.

4.2 the non-near-horizon case

we now move on to discuss the a = 1 case. the background bosonic isometry group is
iso(3, 1)  so(6). the vacuum conguration consists of a hyperplane extending along
directions 45678, located at arbitrary values of x i, i = 1, 2, 3 and x 9. therefore, the world-
volume bosonic symmetry group is r so(5) so(3). both the worldvolume superalgebra
and its maximal extension are obtained by applying the general procedure, as was done in
the near-horizon case. however, it can also be obtained from the a = 0 results. we nd this
alternative illustrative, so we describe it here.

comparing to the a = 0 case, we see that the so(2, 1) conformal symmetry appearing
there, has been broken to just time translations r, its poincare part. in general, the poincare
algebra is not a simple algebra, it is the semi-direct sum of translations and the lorentz
algebra. in this case, the latter is trivial, because there is just the time direction13.

similarly, the worldvolume superalgebra osp(4|4) from the a = 0 case is broken, for a =
1, to an algebra which is the super-poincare subalgebra of the 1-dimensional superconformal
algebra14. the latter contains as rst part the q-supersymmetries and what appears in their
anticommutator, i.e. the (time) translations. this part satises jacobi identities by itself.
but it is not a simple superalgebra. the full super-poincare algebra is the semi-direct sum of
this rst part with the lorentz algebra, and the automorphism group of the supersymmetries.
the conformal algebra is here so(2, 1), and has no lorentz subalgebra. the automorphism
group is so(3)so(5). the so(5) rotations belong to the worldvolume algebra for the d5,
being its worldspace rotations. for d5, so(3) is the r-symmetry. this is the worldvolume
algebra for a = 1.

the extended worldvolume superalgebra can again be obtained from the one in the
near-horizon case using the breakdown of the conformal algebra. with the breaking of the
conformal algebra, also its representations are cut. the q and s supersymmetries together
form a representation of the conformal algebra, here so(2, 1). the supersymmetries are
distinguished according to their eigenvalue under the dilatations, which is, with suitable
normalization,  1
2. the ones with positive weight, i.e. the q supersymmetries, are present,
13note that not the full worldvolume coordinate transformation algebra is conformal for a = 0, but only
the part corresponding to the intersection point, which is the 1-dimensional conformal algebra so(2, 1). the
worldvolume coordinate transformations contain also the so(5) rotations, which are from the point of view
of the superconformal theory of the point, an r-symmetry.

14this super-poincare algebra can alternatively be seen as a contraction of the super-ads algebra. we

come back to these issues in appendix b

while the ones with negative eigenvalue, the s supersymmetries, are not any more present.
similarly the central charges u and z in (4.3) can be split according to their eigenvalue under
the dilatation operator, which is 1,0 or 1. only the former appear in the anticommutator
of two q supersymmetries, and they thus remain in the super-poincare algebra, while the
others do not. those which remain are the u and z as in (4.6). the bosonic generators
in there mutually commute and commute with the supersymmetries. the full extended
worldvolume algebra thus consists of these generators and in general the lorentz generators
(not present in this case) and the r-symmetry generators of the superconformal algebra,
which are here the so(3) part of the so(4) generators r[ij] as r-symmetries for the d5
brane, and m, the generators of so(5) worldspace rotations.

still a third possibility to obtain the full extended worldvolume superalgebra consists in
starting from the one of a d5-brane in a at background [14] and restricting to the generators
preserved when a d3-brane is added to the conguration.

the result can be described as a contraction of osp(1|8). the latter contains the anti-
commutator (4.6), but with bosonic operators that do not commute mutually or with the
supersymmetries, similar to (4.4). the contraction consists in scaling the fermionic genera-
tors with x, the bosonic ones with x2, and then taking the limit x  .
as in the a = 0 case we have the identication (4.7). note that now z9 is a singlet
under the whole symmetry group, as corresponds to the fact that now, in contrast to the
a = 0 case, this group does not act on the coordinate r to which z9 is proportional. apart
from this dierence, the conclusions about z9 are the same as in the a = 0 case:
it has
the interpretation of a fundamental string in the 9th direction15 and this string breaks no
additional supersymmetries if the energy is properly chosen.

4.3

interpretation of the central charges

let us start with the a = 1 case. in addition to the combination (4.7) of energy minus string
charge, the algebra (4.6) contains the charges u and z ()
[] . using standard arguments (see
for instance [21] for examples in the m-theory context), one can show that these correspond
to 1/2 bps solutions of the worldvolume theory. bearing in mind the interpretation of
the r-symmetry as rotations in the d3-brane worldspace, these charges suggest a space-
time interpretation of the corresponding worldvolume solutions [7]. in our case they can be
interpreted as a third brane intersecting the d5-brane in the d3 background, preserving 1/8
supersymmetry (4 supercharges). we now proceed to show that this interpretation is indeed
correct. (for an analogous discussion for a d5-brane in a at background, see [14].)

the charge u transforms in the (5, 1) representation of so(5)  so(3). the bps
solution corresponding to it can be interpreted in space-time as a triple intersection of a
d5-brane, a d3-brane and either

 an ns5-brane in e.g. the 45679 directions,
 a d1-brane in e.g. the 4 direction, or
 a d7-brane in e.g. the 1234567 directions.

these congurations indeed preserve 1/8 supersymmetry. let us e.g.
illustrate the rst
one. a charge in the (5,1) representation of so(5)  so(3) selects either 1 or (by hodge
duality) 4 of the 5 worldspace directions 45678, and either none or 3 of the 123 directions.

15note that from the symmetry group point of view, z9, being a singlet, could also be interpreted as a
0-brane inside the d5; however, since there is no 0-brane in the iib theory, we conclude that z9 must be
associated to a fundamental string in the 9th direction. (a d-string would not yield a bps conguration.)

suppose we take it to select 4 worldspace directions, for instance 4567, and none among the
123. then we would have to associate it to a 4-brane inside the d5-brane, but there is no
4-brane in the iib theory. however, since the 9th direction is inert under the worldvolume
symmetry group, we can assume that we have a 5-brane instead, extending along directions
4567 and 9. hence, we end up with the interpretation of an ns5-brane along directions
45679 (a d5-brane along these directions would not be bps).

analogously, z ()

[] corresponds to one of the following branes:

 a d5-brane in e.g. the 23456 directions,
 a d3-brane in e.g. the 145 directions, or
 an ns5-brane in e.g. the 23459 directions.
so far, we have interpreted the charges for the a = 1 case.

in the a = 0 case, the
same charges appear in the {q, q} anticommutator, and there are many more in {q, s}
and {s, s}. these do not represent other solutions. indeed, as explained in the previous
subsections, and as will be illustrated in appendix b, these charges are partners of those in
{q, q} in representations of the bosonic conformal algebra. this is similar to the special
conformal transformations k, which are just partners of the translations p . in fact, the
charges in the {q, q} anticommutator constitute a maximal commuting subset.

5 conclusions

in this paper we have extended the bps method for branes propagating in a at back-
ground to the case of branes in a non-trivial, curved background. this method has two
complementary aspects.

on the one hand, the energy density is written as a sum of squares in a handy way. this

allows the derivation of a bps bound and the corresponding rst order bps equation.

on the other hand, the bps bound is interpreted in terms of a central charge appearing
in the maximally extended worldvolume supersymmetry algebra. this algebra is constructed
by rst analyzing the bosonic symmetries preserved by the vacuum solution and second con-
structing the most general anticommutator of the corresponding supersymmetry generators,
including all possible central charges.

we have explicitly analyzed the case of a d5-brane in the background of a d3-brane,
both in the near and non-near horizon cases. we have obtained in a unied way the bps
equations previously found in [11] and [13].

in the case of the near horizon geometry, the bosonic symmetries of the vacuum solution
are so(2, 1)  so(5)  so(3), the worldvolume algebra is osp(4|4), and the correspond-
ing maximally extended worldvolume superalgebra is osp(1|16), whose algebra contains 16
supercharges. the bps bound is associated to a central charge, representing strings end-
ing on the d5-worldvolume. thus the existence of a bps conguration preserving all 16
supercharges has been understood at the level of the worldvolume supersymmetry algebra.
for the non-near horizon case, the bosonic symmetries of the vacuum solution are ir 
so(5)  so(3) and the maximally extended worldvolume supersymmetry algebra is a con-
traction of osp(1|8), which contains 8 supercharges. the charges appearing in the world-
volume algebra are interpreted in terms of multiple intersections of branes.

b superalgebras and subalgebras

in the main text we referred to various poincare, ads and conformal superalgebras, and
their relations as subalgebras or contractions. here we will repeat the standard relations
and generalize them to the extended worldvolume algebras. to have a less trivial example
than so(2, 1) as in the main text, we treat the algebra of the d3 background, which is
n = 4 supersymmetric in d = 4.
 where  denotes
the spinor index of so(3, 1), and i = 1, . . . 4 is a vector index for su(4). we use chiral
notations, i.e.

the super-poincare algebra is the semi-direct sum of the solvable algebra with only qi

algebra u(4).

now we look to extensions with central charges. as explained in footnote 1, we use this
terminology to denote generators which appear in the anticommutator of supersymmetries.
these thus also contain generators which are neither the space-time symmetry generators,
nor singlets under space-time symmetries, i.e. generators violating the colemanmandula
theorem [23]. we can add generators to the anticommutator of the supersymmetries:

where [ij] denotes an antisymmetric tensor, (ij) a symmetric tensor and y is a traceless
tensor. r is complex while for z the complex conjugates are the selfdual and antiselfdual

components. we have taken at the right hand side all possible terms consistent with the
symmetry, in total 136 bosonic generators. we have given their content in representations
of so(3, 1)  su(4). the algebra osp(1|16) has all the generators in (b.4). in that super-
algebra the 136 bosonic generators have non-trivial commutation relations, namely those of
sp(16), and the fermionic generators have the commutation relations with the bosonic ones
appropriate for a 16-representation. however, as extension of the super-poincare algebra, all
these bosonic generators mutually commute, and commute with the supersymmetries. thus
one may regard that algebra as a contraction of osp(1|16), where rst all the fermionic
generators are scaled with x, the bosonic ones with x2, and then the limit x   is taken.
the full extended super-poincare algebra is as before the semi-direct sum of this algebra
with the so(3, 1) lorentz-generators m, and the u(4) automorphism generators u i
j. all
generators have commutators with m and u i

j as indicated by their indices.

in a superconformal extension, we should also include the special supersymmetries si
,
. these have opposite chirality as qi,
2(1 + 5)si. the usual superconformal algebra has anticommutators between the

appearing in the commutator [k, qi

here (p, d, m, k) are the generators of the conformal algebra so(4, 2) and u i

ate16 su(4). this superconformal algebra is su(2, 2|4). it can be truncated to the super-
poincare algebra given above by deleting the generators s, d and k.
again we can consider a larger algebra with all generators allowed in the supersymmetry
commutators. it contains the anticommutator (b.4) and a copy of it with q replaced with
s and all the bosonic generators getting a partner in the same way as k is the partner of
p in (b.5). the remaining anticommutators are

the ones in the last anticommutator are complex. the names have been chosen such that
the generators with primes combine with those of {q, q} without primes and their partners
in {s, s} in representations of so(4, 2). in this way we have in the bosonic algebra
(15, 1)(p, d, m, k) + [(1, 15) + (1, 1)](u) + 2 (6, 6)(r) + (15, 15)(y ) + (20, 10)(z)

as decomposition under so(4, 2) su(4). the generators have all non-trivial commutation
relations, as they form the algebra sp(32). the superalgebra is osp(1|32).
16in fact, this case is special in that the trace of u i

j is not part of the simple algebra. it can either be
included as a central charge or as an automorphism. in the rst case, this means that the trace of u is
included in (b.5), but then it is central, i.e. it commutes with the supersymmetries, and we should thus
write

alternatively, the u (1) factor does not commute with the supersymmetries, i.e. (b.5) remains unchanged,
but then it should not appear in (b.5), where we should thus replace u i

j by u i

ume algebra of the d3 background in the near-horizon case, containing the anticommutators
in (b.4) and in (b.6). it has two important subalgebras. one is the non-extended worldvol-
ume superconformal algebra su(2, 2|4) containing the anticommutators in (b.5), the other
is the extended super-poincare algebra, where the s-supersymmetries have been removed,
together with parts of other so(4, 2) multiplets. the non-extended super-poincare alge-
bra is a subalgebra of as well the superconformal non-extended algebra, as of the extended
super-poincare algebra. both these poincare algebras are contractions of simple algebras,
respectively osp(1|16) and osp(4|4), which are near-horizon algebras for the theory which
we consider in the paper, with a d5 worldvolume in a d3 background. the constructions ex-
plained above can be repeated in this smaller algebra, with a similar structure of subalgebras
and contractions.

remark that by taking other decompositions of the 32-component spinors we could,
instead of going to su(2, 2|4), also have gone to e.g. osp(8|4) for the conformal algebra
in 3 dimensions, related to m2 or to osp(8|4) for 6 dimensions, related to m5 [24]. the
general setup of this article is also applicable to these cases.
