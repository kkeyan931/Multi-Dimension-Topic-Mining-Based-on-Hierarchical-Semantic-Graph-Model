abstract

the chiral wznw symplectic form 
chir is inverted in the general case. thereby a precise
relationship between the arbitrary monodromy dependent 2-form appearing in 
chir and the
exchange r-matrix that governs the poisson brackets of the group valued chiral elds is estab-
lished. the exchange r-matrices are shown to satisfy a new dynamical generalization of the
classical modied yang-baxter (yb) equation and poisson-lie (pl) groupoids are constructed
that encode this equation analogously as pl groups encode the classical yb equation. for an
arbitrary simple lie group g, exchange r-matrices are found that are in one-to-one correspon-
dence with the possible pl structures on g and admit them as pl symmetries.

1 introduction

this paper contains a systematic analysis of the classical phase space that arises from the chiral
separation of the degrees of freedom in the wess-zumino-novikov-witten (wznw) model [1].
the wznw model occupies a central position in conformal eld theory [2]. various structures
that emerged from its study play an increasingly important role in other areas of theoretical
physics and in mathematics as well [3]. among these structures are the quadratic exchange
algebras that encode the poisson brackets (pbs) of the chiral group valued elds, gc(xc)
for c = l, r, which yield the general solution of the wznw eld equation as g(xl, xr) =
gl(xl)g1
r (xr). these exchange algebras were investigated intensively at the beginning of the
decade ([4]  [15]) motivated by the idea to understand the quantum group properties of the
wznw model [16] directly by means of canonical quantization [17, 18, 19]. in accordance with
the general philosophy of quantum groups [20], the poisson-lie (pl) symmetries of the chiral
elds should be the most relevant in this respect.

the chiral wznw poisson structures found in the literature have the form

ngc(x) , gc(y)o =

1

c(cid:16)gc(x)  gc(y)(cid:17)(cid:16)r +

1
2

i sign (y  x)(cid:17),

0 < x, y < 2,

(1.1)

where i is given by the quadratic casimir of the simple lie algebra, g, of the wznw group,
g, and the interesting object is the exchange r-matrix r. the choice of the pb is highly
non-unique due to the fact that the gc are determined by the physical eld g only up to the
gauge freedom gc 7 gcp for any constant p  g. in general r may depend on the monodromy
matrix m of the chiral elds, which satisfy gc(x + 2) = gc(x)m. there are two qualitatively
dierent cases that correspond to building the wznw eld out of chiral elds with diagonal
monodromy (bloch waves) or out of elds with generic monodromy.

for bloch waves [8, 9, 10], the poisson structure is essentially unique and the associated
r-matrix is a solution of the so called classical dynamical yang-baxter (cdyb) equation, which
has recently received a lot of attention (see e.g. the review in [21]).

for chiral elds with generic monodromy, it has been argued in [11, 14] that the possible
exchange r-matrices should correspond to certain local dierential 2-forms  on open domains
g  g, whose exterior derivative is the 3-form that occurs in the wznw action. the precise
connection between  and r has not been elaborated, and in most papers dealing with generic
monodromy actually only those very special cases were considered for which r is a monodromy
independent constant. in these cases r is necessarily a solution of the classical modied yb
equation on the lie algebra g with a certain denite normalization (eq. (3.71) with (3.64)).
this is a nice situation since if the same r-matrix is used to equip g with a pl structure,
then the gauge action of g on the chiral wznw eld denes a pl symmetry. however, this
mechanism of pl symmetry is not available in the physically most interesting case of a compact
lie group, because the relevant normalization admits no constant r-matrix for a compact g.
thus, in addition to the problem to understand the case of a general , an interesting question
is whether the exchange r-matrix can be chosen for a compact group in such a way to admit a
pl symmetry on the chiral wznw phase space.

in this paper we study the family of chiral exchange algebras (1.1) concentrating on the case
of generic monodromy (for a related investigation of bloch waves, see [22]). our main results
are the following.

1

 first, we establish the relationship between the 2-form  introduced in [11, 14] and the
corresponding exchange r-matrix in the general case. the result is given by eq. (3.36)
with the notations in (3.35), (3.21), (3.2).

 second, we point out a dynamical generalization of the modied yb equation, eq. (3.63),

whose solutions are the exchange r-matrices for generic monodromy.

 third, we present explicitly a subfamily of the exchange r-matrices whose members are in
one-to-one correspondence with the possible pl structures on g and admit them as pl
symmetries. these exchange r-matrices, given by (5.18) with (5.22), contain the constant
r-matrices studied earlier, and in another remarkable special case of them the gauge action
of the group g becomes a classical symmetry, i.e., pl symmetry with the zero poisson
structure on g. they work for any (compact or not) simple lie group.

 fourth, we construct a family of pl groupoids that encode the dynamical yb equation
(3.63) analogously as pl groups encode the classical yb equation. this result generalizes
a construction of [23] from diagonal to generic monodromy.

the above mentioned results have been announced in [24] without proofs. in addition to
their detailed account, several other technical results can be found in this paper. the systematic
exposition of the subject and the numerous examples that we present may be useful as a starting
point for future studies.

the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows. in the next section a necessary review
of the chiral separation of the wznw phase space is presented. section 3 contains a detailed
account of the inversion of the possible symplectic structures on the chiral wznw phase space,
leading to the exchange algebra (1.1). here many interesting additional issues are considered
as well. in section 4 an alternative, shorter but less rigorous, derivation of the general exchange
algebra is given, and a quick derivation of the exchange algebra of bloch waves is also included.
section 5 is devoted to a general outline of the pl symmetries of the exchange algebra, and in
particular to the exchange r-matrices for which the standard gauge action of g on the chiral
wznw eld yields such a symmetry. section 6 deals with the interpretation of the chiral
wznw poisson structures in terms of pl groupoids. the paper ends with a discussion, and
there are also two appendices containing some examples and the details of a proof.

2 the wznw solution space and its chiral extension

in this section we review the structure of the wznw hamiltonian system concentrating on
the possible symplectic forms on the chiral extension of its solution space, which are examined
throughout the paper. the presentation closely follows the line of thought found in [14].

we consider a simple, real or complex, lie algebra, g, with a corresponding connected lie
group, g, and identify the phase space of the wznw model associated with the group g as

m = t eg = { (g, jl) | g  eg, jl  eg },

(2.1)

where eg = c (s1, g) is the loop group and eg = c (s1,g) is its lie algebra. the isomorphism
of the cotangent bundle t eg with egeg is established by means of right-translations on eg. the

2

elements g  eg (resp. jl  eg) are modeled as 2-periodic g-valued (resp. g-valued) functions

on the real line r. the phase space is equipped with the symplectic form

 = dz 2

0

d tr(cid:16)jldgg1(cid:17) +



2z 2

0

d tr(cid:16)dgg1(cid:17) (cid:16)dgg1(cid:17)

(2.2)

with some constant . here prime denotes derivative with respect to the space variable,   r,
and for any a, b  g tr (ab) denotes a xed multiple of the cartan-killing scalar product. if
g and the left-current jl serve as coordinates on m, then the right-current is given by

jr = g1jlg + g1g,

(2.3)

and in the alternative variables (g, jr) the symplectic form reads

 = dz 2

0

d tr(cid:16)jrg1dg(cid:17) 



2z 2

0

d tr(cid:16)g1dg(cid:17) (cid:16)g1dg(cid:17)

.

(2.4)

although the expression of  appears rather formal at rst sight, it can be used to un-
ambiguously associate hamiltonian vector elds and pbs with a set of admissible functions,
which include, for example, the fourier components of g, jl and jr. we do not elaborate the
precise meaning of the symplectic form here, since this is a standard matter in the context of
the full wznw model, but will face the analogous issue in the chiral context later, where it is
much less understood. the only point that we wish to note is that in the case of a complex
lie algebra the admissible functions depend holomorphically on the matrix elements of g, jl,

holomorphic cotangent bundle.

jr in the nite dimensional irreducible representations of g, and eg  eg is then a model of the

hamiltons equation can be written in the alternative forms [1]

lg = jlg,

rjl = 0  rg = gjr,

ljr = 0.

(2.7)

let msol be the space of solutions of the wznw system. msol consists of the smooth
g-valued functions g(,  ) which are 2-periodic in  and satisfy r(lg g1) = 0. the general
solution of this evolution equation can be written as

g(,  ) = gl(xl)g1

r (xr),

(2.8)

where (gl, gr) is any pair of g-valued, smooth, quasiperiodic function on r with equal mon-
odromies, i.e., for c = l, r one has gc(xc + 2) = gc(xc)m with some c-independent m  g.
to elaborate this representation of the solutions in more detail, we dene the space cm:

(2.9)

cm := {(gl, gr)|gl,r  c (r, g),

gl,r(x + 2) = gl,r(x)m m  g}.
3

g  p : (gl, gr) 7 (glp, grp).

there is a free right-action of g on cm given by
notice that cm is a principal bre bundle over msol with respect to the above action of g. the
projection of this bundle,  : cm  msol, is given by
we can identify m with msol by associating the elements of the solution space with their

 : (gl, gr) 7 g = glg1

g(,  ) = gl(xl)g1

initial data at  = 0. formally, this is described by the map

r (xr).

(2.10)

(2.11)

i.e.

r

 : msol  m,

 : msol  g(,  ) 7(cid:16)g(, 0), jl() = (lg g1)(, 0)(cid:17)  m.

(2.12)

obviously, () is then the natural symplectic form on the solution space. explicitly,

()(g) = (cid:18)d z 2

2z 2

0

d tr(cid:16)g1dg(cid:17)  (cid:16)g1dg(cid:17)(cid:19)| =0

(2.13)

regarding now msol as the base of the bundle  : cm  msol, we obtain a closed 2-form, b,
on cm,

(2.14)

b := () = (  ).

by substituting the explicit formula (2.11) of , one nds that

where

b(gl, gr) = lchir(gl) + rchir(gr),

l := ,

r := ,

(2.15)

(2.16)

and chir is the so called chiral wznw 2-form:

chir(gc) = 
mc = g1

c (x)gc(x + 2).

tr (cid:16)(g1

c (cid:17) ,
c dgc)(0)  dmc m 1

(2.17)

this crucial formula of b was rst obtained by gawedzki [11].
it is clear from its denition that db = 0, but b is not a symplectic form on cm, since it
is degenerate. of course, its restriction to any (local) section of the bundle  : cm  msol is a
symplectic form, since such sections yield (local) models of msol. on the other hand, one can
check that chir has a nonvanishing exterior derivative [11]:

dchir(gc) = 

1
6

tr (cid:16)m 1

c dmc  m 1

c dmc  m 1

c dmc(cid:17) .

(2.18)

although this cancels from db, since ml = mr for the elements of cm, it makes the chiral

separation of the wznw degrees of freedom a very nontrivial and interesting problem.

4

the problem of the chiral separation can be described as follows [14]. first, recall that the
chiral currents jc (c = l, r) generate two commuting copies of the nontwisted ane kac-
moody (km) algebra of g and the wznw eld (2.8) is a km primary eld under the poisson
bracket dened by the symplectic form on msol. in fact, by dening fourier components as

j ,n

c :=z 2

0

dxc einxc tr (t jc)(xc)

using a basis1 t  of g, it can be derived from (2.13) that the currents satisfy

c , j ,n

{j ,m

c } = f 

 j ,m+n

c

+ 2icmm,ni ,

l , j ,n

{j ,m

r } = 0,

and

{g(xl, xr), j ,n

l } = einxlt g(xl, xr),

{g(xl, xr), j ,n

r } = einxrg(xl, xr)t .

(2.21)

second, the currents almost completely determine the chiral wznw elds gc, and thus also
g = glg1

r , by means of the dierential equations

ccgc = jcgc

for c = l, r.

(2.22)

thus it appears an interesting possibility to construct the wznw model as a reduction of a
simpler model, in which the left and right-moving degrees of freedom would be separated in
terms of completely independent chiral elds gl and gr regarded as fundamental variables. it
is clear that the solution space of such a chirally extended model must be a direct product of
two identical but independent spaces, i.e., it must have the form

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

with

cmext := ml  mr

mc := {gc | gc  c (r, g),

gc(x + 2) = gc(x)mc mc  g}.

the space cmext must be endowed with such a symplectic structure, b
on the submanifold cm  cmext dened by the periodicity constraint
it is easy to see that these requirements force b

ml = mr.

ext(gl, gr) = l

chir(gl) + r

chir(gr)

ext to have the following form:

ext, that reduces to b

where

b



chir(gc) = chir(gc) + (mc)

with some 2-form  depending only on the monodromy of gc. since in the extended model the
factors (mc, c
chir) must be symplectic manifolds separately, we have to satisfy the condition
d

(2.28)

c dmc  m 1

c dmc  m 1

c dmc(cid:17) + d(mc) = 0.

chir = 

1
6

tr (cid:16)m 1

1we have i  := tr (t t ) and [t , t ] = f 

 t  with summation over coinciding indices.

5

the problem now arises from the well-known fact that no globally dened smooth 2-form exists
on g that would satisfy this condition for all mc  g.
there are two rather dierent wayouts from the above diculty [14]. the rst is to restrict
the possible domain of the monodromy matrix mc to some open submanifold in g on which
an appropriate 2-form  may be found. we refer to a choice of such a domain and a  as a
chiral extension of the wznw system, and will explore the structure of the associated pb in
the subsequent sections.

the second possibility is to restrict the domain of the allowed monodromy matrices much
more drastically from the beginning, in such a way that after the restriction dchir vanishes,
whereby the diculty disappears. for example, one may achieve this by restricting the mon-
odromy matrices to vary in a xed maximal torus of g, which amounts to constructing (a
subset of) the solutions of the wznw eld equation in terms of chiral bloch waves. this
second possibility is especially natural in the case of compact or complex lie groups, for which
there is only one maximal torus up to conjugation. the restriction to bloch waves is equivalent

to a partial (and local) gauge xing of the bundle  : cm  msol. the resulting symplectic

form is studied in detail in [22].

3 the chiral wzwn phase space

we here investigate the structure of the chiral wznw phase space mc introduced in sec. 2.
the analysis is the same for both chiralities, c = l, r, and we simplify our notation by putting
mchir for mc and g, m, j,  for gc, mc, jc, c, respectively. we assume that the monodromy
matrix m is restricted to some open submanifold g  g on which a smooth 2-form  is chosen
in such a way that (2.28) holds. the domain in mchir that corresponds to m  g is denoted
by mchir.
chir, dened by (2.27) with (2.17), is nondegenerate if g is
appropriately chosen (so that eq. (3.34) has a smooth, unique solution), and we shall describe
the general features of the pbs on mchir associated with this symplectic form. we will then
consider examples, in particular the choices of  introduced in [14] that lead to poisson-lie
symmetry on the full mchir.

it turns out that 

3.1 lie algebraic and dierential geometric conventions

before we can turn to the task of inverting 

chir, we need to set up some conventions.

an element a  g has the components a = tr (at) and a = tr (at ) with respect to

dual bases t and t  of g:

tr (tt ) = 
,

i  = tr (t t ),

i = tr (tt).

(3.1)

we will use i  and i to raise and lower lie algebra indices. given a matrix q, we can
dene an operator q  end(g) and an element q  g  g by

q(a) = tqa,

q = qt  t.

(3.2)

the matrix i  denes the identity operator i, and i = tt  is the tensor casimir. for any
m  g, the matrix of the linear operator ad m on g, which we write as (ad m)(a) = mam 1,

6

will be denoted as

w(m) = tr (tmtm 1).

the property (ad m)(ad m ) = (ad m m ) yields the matrix multiplication rule

w(m)i w( m) = w(m m ),

(3.3)

(3.4)

and we also have

w(m) = w(m 1) = w 1

 (m),

w(m)i w 1

 (m) = i.

(3.5)

acting on a smooth function  on g, we introduce the dierential operators

(l)(m) :=
and their linear combinations

d
dt

(ettm)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

,

(r)(m) :=

d
dt

(mett)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

,

(3.6)

(3.7)
for some purposes we will use a representation  : g  gl(v ) of g on a nite dimensional
vector space v . the corresponding representation of g is denoted by the same letter, and we
put
(3.8)

d
 := r  l.

m  := (m)

t  := (t )

for m  g,

for t  g.

such representations will be used (e.g. the irreducible ones) that

tr (tt) = ctr (t 

 t 
 )

holds with a constant c, and we will then write

tr (ab) := ctr (ab),

a, b  end(v ).

(3.9)

(3.10)

on the left hand side of eq. (3.9) tr is a xed (representation independent) multiple of the
cartan-killing form of g, while tr is matrix trace over the representation space v .
assumed to be smooth in x and is subject to the monodromy condition

remember that the phase space mchir is parametrized by the g-valued eld g(x), which is

g(x + 2) = g(x)m

m  g.

(3.11)

the corresponding chiral current, j(x) = g(x)g1(x)  g, is thus a smooth, 2-periodic
function of x. to dene tangent vectors at g  mchir, we rst have to consider smooth curves
on the phase space. such a curve is given by a function (x, t)  g, which is smooth in x, t
and satises the deformed monodromy condition

(x + 2, t) = (x, t)m(t)

m(t)  g.

(3.12)

to make sure that the curve passes through g  mchir at t = 0, we require (x, 0) = g(x).
a vector x[g] at g  mchir is obtained as the velocity to the curve at t = 0, encoded by the
g-valued, smooth function

(3.13)

(x) :=

d
dt

g1(x)(x, t)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

.

7

it is useful to note that, due to the analogous property of g, the function  on r may be
reconstructed from its restriction to [0, 2]. the monodromy properties of (x) can be derived
by taking the derivative of (3.12),

(x + 2) = m 1(x)m.

(3.14)

this can be solved in terms of a smooth, 2-periodic g-valued function, xj (x), and a constant
lie algebra element, 0, as follows:

(x) = 0 +z x

0

dy g1(y)xj(y)g(y).

(3.15)

a vector eld x on mchir is an assignment, g 7 x[g], of a vector to every point g  mchir.

it acts on a dierentiable function, g 7 f [g], on mchir by the denition

gt(x) = (x, t).

(3.16)

x(f )[g] =

d
dt

f [gt](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

since a vector x[g] can be parametrized by (x), which, in turn, can be parametrized by the pair

(0, xj(x)), we can specify a vector eld by the assignments g 7 0[g]  g and g 7 xj [g]  eg.
of course, the evaluation functions f x[g] := g(x) and f x[g] := j(x) are dierentiable with
respect to any vector eld, and their derivatives are given by

x(g(x)) = g(x)(x)

and

x(j(x)) = xj (x),

(3.17)

which claries the meaning of xj as well. it is also obvious from (3.11) that the monodromy
matrix yields a g-valued dierentiable function on mchir, g 7 m = g1(x)g(x + 2), whose
derivative is characterized by the g-valued function

x(m)m 1 = m(x + 2)m 1  (x).

(3.18)

having dened vector elds, one can now introduce dierential forms as usual. we only
remark that by (3.17) evaluation 1-forms like dg(x), dj(x) or (g1dg)(x) are perfectly well-
dened:

dg(x)(x) = x(g(x)) = g(x)(x),
(g1(x)dg(x))(x) = (x).

dj(x)(x) = x(j(x)) = xj (x),

(3.19)

3.2 admissible hamiltonians and hamiltonian vector elds

now we turn to the following problem. for a xed (scalar) function f on the phase space
mchir, we are looking for a corresponding vector eld, y f , satisfying

x(f ) = 

chir(x, y f )

(3.20)

for all vector elds x. notice that y f does not necessarily exist for a given f . we say
that f is an element of the set of admissible hamiltonians, denoted as h, if the corresponding
hamiltonian vector eld, y f , exists. our purpose is to characterize h and to describe the
mapping h  f 7 y f .

8

we rst compute 

chir(x, y ) for two vector elds x and y . let x be parametrized by
(x) and further by the pair (0, xj (x)). the analogous parametrization for y is given by (x)
and the pair (0, yj(x)). recall that 
chir is dened by eqs. (2.17), (2.27), and parametrize 
now as

(m) =

q(m)tr(tm 1dm)  tr(tm 1dm).

(3.21)

1
2

the q, q = q, are smooth functions on the domain g  g, such that d
mchir. a simple calculation, using partial integrations and (3.18), gives that

chir = 0 on



chir(x, y ) = chir(x, y ) + (x, y ),

(3.22)

where

and

with

chir(x, y ) = z 2

dxtr(cid:16)xj (x)g(x)(cid:16)(x)

by (m) := q(m)ttr(cid:16)tm 1y (m)(cid:17).

(3.25)

of course, all the expressions that appear in the above formula are functions of g  mchir.
let us now suppose that f  h and apply the above formula to y := y f . then the form
of the right hand side of (3.20) implies that there must exist a smooth g-valued function on r,
af (x), and a constant lie algebra element, af , such that for any vector eld x

x(f ) = z 2

0

dxtr(cid:16)xj (x)af (x)(cid:17) + tr (0af ).

(3.26)

this means that f  h must have an exterior derivative parametrized by the assignments
g 7 af (x)[g] and g 7 af [g]. on the other hand, if f is such that (3.26) holds, then we may
try to solve (3.20) for the hamiltonian vector eld. using the parametrization of y by (x),
this leads to the following two equations:

m 1y (m) + by (m) = g1(x)af (x)g(x),

and

m 1y (m) + y (m)m 1  2by (m) + 2mby (m)m 1 = 2af .

now it is clear that (x) can be directly read o from (3.27). from the identity (x) =
g1(x)yj (x)g(x), we then obtain that

(3.27)

(3.28)

yj (x) = af

(3.29)

this not only gives us the explicit formula of yj , but also means that any f  h must be such
that the right hand side of (3.29) denes a 2-periodic smooth function of x. incidentally, this
is equivalent to the monodromy condition (3.14) applied to the hamiltonian vector eld y . to
proceed further, we use

this implies that eqs. (3.27) and (3.28) are not linearly independent, and they can be simulta-
neously solved for (x) only if one has

y (m)m 1 = m(2)m 1  (0).

(3.30)

af = g1(0)haf (0)  af (2)ig(0).

(3.31)

we now also see that the pair (af , af ) is uniquely determined for any f  h. indeed, the
restriction of af to [0, 2] is completely xed by (3.26), and is uniquely extended to a function
on r on account of the periodicity of the expression in (3.29).

to summarize, we have shown that every element f  h must satisfy the three conditions2
expressed by (3.26), the periodicity of yj (x) in (3.29), and (3.31). conversely, it turns out that
these conditions characterize h. in fact, if these conditions are satised then the solution of
(3.27), (3.28) for  is given by

(x) = g1(x)af (x)g(x)

af + r(m)(af ) ,

(3.32)

(3.33)

(3.34)

this formula of (x) = g1(x)y f (g(x)) is one of the main results in this paper.

some remarks are here in order. first, in (3.34) we suppressed the m-dependence of the
 = tr (tmt m 1). second, in terms of
various matrices like q 
the notations given at the beginning of the section, r(m) is the linear operator on g associated
with the matrix r(m). by introducing now the operators r(m) and q(m) that correspond
to the matrices

 (m) = q(m)i and w 

r
 (m) = r(m)

i 

and q

 (m) = q(m)

eq. (3.34) can be rewritten, in fact, in the following equivalent form:

q+(m)  r(m) = q(m)  ad (m 1)  r+(m).

the solution can be formally written as

1

2(cid:16)q+(m)  q(m)  ad (m 1)(cid:17)1

(cid:16)q+(m) + q(m)  ad (m 1)(cid:17) .

(3.36)

(3.37)

r(m) =

2these conditions do not depend on the 2-form , a reason for this is described at the end of sec. 3.5.

10

this shows that one must dene the domain g in such a way that the inverse operator above
exists, which is always possible since it becomes the identity operator at m = e  g. then
it is easy to see that (3.37) yields a smooth, antisymmetric matrix function r(m) on g. by
choosing g  g appropriately, hence we may indeed associate with the smooth 2-form  on g
a unique, smooth map g  m 7 r(m)  end(g). third, we will see in the next section that
the object
(3.38)

r(m) = r(m)t  t  g  g

appears in the classical exchange algebra that encodes the poisson brackets corresponding to
the symplectic form 
chir and it satises a dynamical generalization of the modied classical
yang-baxter equation. incidentally, 
chir is symplectic (i.e. nondegenerate) in the sense that
it permits to unambiguously determine the map h  f 7 y f , as we just saw, and h will turn
out to contain a complete set of functions on mchir.
finally, as for the derivation of eq. (3.34), note that one may arrive at the special form of
the integration constant in formula (3.32) of (x) by the expectation of a classical exchange
algebra type pb for the eld g(x), or simply by inspecting the equations that result if one writes
(x) = g1(x)af (x)g(x) + constant. after introducing (3.32) as an ansatz, it is not dicult to
verify that (3.27) and (3.28) reduce to (3.34).

3.3 elements of h and their poisson brackets

below we describe a large set of functions that are admissible hamiltonians and apply the
result in (3.32) to nd their hamiltonian vector elds. we shall also discuss the interpretation
of these hamiltonian vector elds in terms of pbs, in particular we shall see that the eld g(x)
is subject to a quadratic exchange algebra.

let us rst study functions that depend on g only through the current j = gg1. of
(x) in (3.26) would

course, the evaluation functions f y
not be a smooth function of x. therefore we consider the smeared out version

[g] = j(y) do not belong to h, since af y

f :=z 2

0

dxtr(cid:16)(x)j(x)(cid:17),

where (x) is a g-valued, smooth, 2-periodic test function. in this case we nd that

af(x) = (x)

and

af = 0.

(3.39)

(3.40)

the conditions expressed by (3.26), (3.29) and (3.31) are trivially satised and thus f  h.
the parameter (x) of the hamiltonian vector eld y f is (x) = g1(x)(x)g(x), whence

y f(g(x)) = (x)g(x),

y f(j(x)) = [(x), j(x)] + (x),

y f(m) = 0.

(3.41)

this shows in particular that f generates an innitesimal action of the loop group on the
phase space with respect to which g(x) is an ane km primary eld, and the km current
j(x) transforms according to the coadjoint action of the (centrally extended) loop group, as
expected. naturally, the local functionals of j dened as the integral over [0, 2] of any dier-
ential polynomial in the components of j, with periodic, smooth test function coecients, also
belong to h; the corresponding hamiltonian vector elds are easy to determine.

11

now we study some nonlocal functionals of the current. let e  g denote the path ordered
exponential integral of j(x) over [0, 2]. more precisely, we put e := e(2), where e(x)  g
is dened as the solution of

e(x) = j(x)e(x) with e(0) := e  g.

(3.42)

let  be an arbitrary smooth function on g. introduce a corresponding function, , on the
phase space by

[g] := (e).

(3.43)

from the well-known formula of the variation of e(x), we obtain that

a(x) =

1

(cid:16)e(x)t e1(x)(cid:17) (r)(e)

and

a = 0,

(3.44)

where r is dened in (3.6). it follows that the conditions imposed by (3.26) and (3.29) are
satised, actually from (3.29) we get y (j(x)) = 0. however,  does not belong to h in general.
by means of (3.44) we get that

a
(0)  a

 (2) =

1

(cid:16)d

 (cid:17) (e)

(d

 = r  l).

(3.45)

because of the condition (3.31), this means that   h precisely if  is an invariant function on
g with respect to the adjoint action of g on g. examples of invariant functions are furnished
by the trace of e k (k = 1, 2, . . .) in some representation. that only the invariant functions of e
are admissible is a well-known result in the context of current algebras, where they provide the
casimir functions of j. in our context, we obtain from the above that for an invariant function


y (g(x)) =

g(x)t (r)(m),

y (j(x)) = 0,

y (m) = 0.

(3.46)

1


to derive these, we used that, since g and e satisfy the same dierential equation, g(x) =
e(x)g(0). hence m = g1(0)eg(0), and for an invariant function

g1(0)t g(0) (r) (e) = t  (r) (m).

(3.47)

the monodromy matrix m is not a function of j alone, but its invariant functions coincide
with those of e, and we have just seen that these functions belong to h. let us now take an
arbitrary smooth function, , on g and associate with it a function, , on the chiral wznw
phase space by [g] := (m). using (3.18) and the denition of the parameter of a vector
eld, eq. (3.15), one gets that

a(x) =

1

(cid:16)g(x)t g1(x)(cid:17) (r)(m)

and a =

1


t (d

 )(m).

it follows that   h. for the hamiltonian vector eld we obtain y (j(x)) = 0 and

g1(x)y (g(x)) =

1

t (cid:16)d+

 (cid:17) (m) +

1


tr(m)(cid:16)d

 (cid:17) (m).

(3.48)

(3.49)

12

let us elaborate this for the functions dened by the matrix elements of m in some represen-
tation  of g. we denote these matrix elements as m 
ij(x) the corresponding
matrix element of g(x). now we shall use r(m) in (3.38) and

ij and denote by g

r(m) = r(m) 

1
2

i, m1 = m  1, m2 = 1  m.

then (3.49) can be rewritten in the tensorial form

ij(x)) =

ik,jl

(3.50)

(3.51)

(3.52)
is taken in the corresponding representation of g, and our notation is (k  l)ik,jl = kijlkl.
furthermore, we obtain

(m) := r+(m)  m 1

2 r(m)m2

y m 

kl(m 

ij ) =

1

(cid:16)m  m (m)(cid:17)

ik,jl

(m) := (m)  m 1

(m)m1.

(3.53)

(3.54)

where

with

we shall comment on the interpretation of these equations later on.

the pb of two smooth functions f1 and f2 on a nite dimensional smooth symplectic

manifold is dened by the standard formula

{f1, f2} = y f2(f1) = y f1(f2) = (y f2, y f1),

(3.55)

where y fi is the hamiltonian vector eld associated with fi by the symplectic form . the
so obtained poisson algebra is closed under pointwise multiplication of the functions as well as
under the pb. one may formally apply the same formula in the innite dimensional case to
the admissible smooth functions that possess a hamiltonian vector eld. however, it then may
be a very nontrivial problem to fully specify the set of functions that form a closed poisson
algebra, and are a complete set in the sense that they separate the points of the phase space.
in our case, it is clear from the foregoing formulae that the products of local functionals of the
current j and the smooth functions of the monodromy matrix m form two subsets of h that are
separately closed under the pb. moreover, these two subsets commute with each other under
the pb (they should clearly be each others centralizer in an appropriate poisson algebra). but
they do not form a complete set of functions on our phase space, since the fundamental eld
g(x) cannot be completely reconstructed out of j(x) and m.

let us again consider a representation  : g  gl(v ) of g. since the evaluation functions
ij[g] = g

ij(x) are not elements of h, we smear out the local eld and dene

f x

where  : r 7 end(v ) is a smooth test function. it is then easy to see from (3.26) that

0

f[g] :=z 2
g(x)t g1(x)z 2

for x  [0, 2],

(3.56)

(3.57)

by inspecting the condition that y f(j(x)) in (3.29) must be periodic, we nd that f  h for
those  that satisfy
(3.58)

(k)(0) = (k)(2) = 0 ,

k = 0, 1, ...

assuming that this holds, the hamiltonian vector eld y f is obtained from (3.32) as

g1(x)y f(g(x)) =

this permits the following interpretation. let us dene the poisson bracket of the evaluation
functions by the equality

y f(f) := {f, f} :=z 2

0

z 2

0

dxdytr 12(cid:16)(x)  (y)ng(x) , g(y)o(cid:17) ,

where tr 12 means the normalized trace over v  v and
=ng

ng(x) , g(y)oik,jl

ij(x), g

kl(y)o .

(3.60)

(3.61)

with these denitions, formula (3.59) of the hamiltonian vector eld is equivalent to

ng(x) , g(y)o =

1

(cid:16)g(x)  g(y)(cid:17)(cid:16)r(m) +

1
2

i sign (y  x)(cid:17)

,

0 < x, y < 2.

(3.62)

indeed, upon integration the right hand side of (3.60) equals y f(f) for any functions  and
 subject to (3.58). this equation has the form of a quadratic exchange algebra type pb for
the eld g(x). such a classical exchange algebra is usually regarded as a classical analogue of a
quantum group symmetry in the chiral wznw model, but observe that in general our r-matrix
is monodromy dependent.

the admissible hamiltonians of type f,  and f that we studied in the above should
together generate a closed poisson algebra. although at present we cannot fully characterize
the set of elements that belong to this algebra, we wish to point out that the jacobi identity
for three functions of type f, in any poisson algebra that contains them, is equivalent to the
following equation for r(m):

[r12(m), r23(m)] + (m)t 

1 r r23(m) + cycl. perm. = 

f .

1
4

(3.63)

here

(3.64)
and the cyclic permutation is over the three tensorial factors with r23 = r(1  t  t),
1 = t   1  1 and so on. furthermore, we use the components of  = t   t  given by
t 
(3.52), for which

f = ft   t   t 

r =

1
2d+

 + r 

 d
 .

(3.65)

eq. (3.63) can be viewed as a dynamical generalization of the classical modied yb equation,
to which it reduces if the r-matrix is a monodromy independent constant. of course, (3.63) is
satised for any r(m) that arises as a solution of (3.34), since the jacobi identity is guaranteed
by d

chir = 0.

14

for later reference, let us comment here on the analogue of eq. (3.63) that appears in
connection with chiral wznw bloch waves. the space of bloch waves3 in question is dened
as

mbloch := {b  c (r, g) | b(x + 2) = b(x)e,   a  h },

(3.66)
where a is a certain domain in a cartan subalgebra h of g. there is a natural symplectic form
on this space, which is induced by the embedding mbloch  mchir and is given by bloch with

bloch(b) =

tr (cid:16)(b1db)(0)  d(cid:17) .

(3.67)

it is known [8, 9, 10] (for a proof in the spirit of the present paper, see [22]) that the pbs
associated with (3.67) are encoded by the following classical exchange algebra:

nb(x) , b(y)o =

(3.68)

(3.69)

the domain a is chosen so that () / i2z for any root  and the root vectors e satisfy
the normalization tr (ee) = 2
||2 . as was rst pointed out in [8], the jacobi identity of the
pb in this case gives rise to the equation

[ r12(), r23()] +xk

h k

k

r23() + cycl. perm. = 

f ,

4

(3.70)

where k = tr (hk) with respect to a basis hk of h whose dual basis is denoted as h k.
the same classical dynamical yb equation appears in other contexts [25, 26, 27], too, and has
recently received lot of attention [21, 23, 28, 29].

3.4 constant exchange r-matrices

chir on mchir gives rise to a pb of the form
we have seen that any symplectic structure 
(3.62) governed by an exchange r-matrix r(m), which is a solution of eq. (3.63). those cases
for which the exchange r-matrix is m-independent have already been discussed by falceto-
gawedzki [14] and others. the main point [14] here is that one can construct an appropriate
2-form  out of any constant, antisymmetric solution r of the modied classical yb equation,

[r12, r23] + [r13, r23] + [r12, r13] = 

f ,

1
4

(3.71)

and then the same r appears in the exchange algebra determined by 
chir. we below present
the construction of [14], showing that in our formalism it is easy to give a complete proof as
well.

all antisymmetric solutions of (3.71) are known. in fact, belavin and drinfeld [30] classied
the solutions in the case of a complex simple lie algebra and their solutions belong also to the
normal real form. for other real forms very few solutions survive (see theorem 3.3 in [31]).

3in this context g is either a complex simple lie algebra or its normal or compact real form.

15

there is no solution for the compact real form, because of the negative sign of the coecient
on the right hand side. to explain the mechanism [14] whereby constant exchange r-matrices
appear in the chiral wznw model, we rst need to recall a few standard results on eq. (3.71),
which can be found in the reviews (e.g. [14, 32]).

in association with a solution of (3.71), r = rt  t  g g, one has the constant linear

2i. it follows from (3.71) that the formula

operators r and r = r  1

[a, b]r = [r(a), b] + [a, r(b)],

a, b  g,
denes a new lie bracket on the linear space g; the lie algebra (g, [ ,
then r : gr  g are lie algebra homomorphisms,

(3.72)

]r) is denoted as gr.

[r(a), r(b)] = r ([a, b]r) .

any a  g can be decomposed as

a = a+  a

with

a := r(a).

as a consequence of (3.73), one has the following equality of linear operators on g,

exp (ada)  r = r  exp (adra)

a  g.

(3.73)

(3.74)

(3.75)

here ada and adra are dened by (ada)(b) = [a, b] and (adra)(b) = [a, b]r for any a, b 
g. note also that there exists a neighbourhood of the unit element in g, now denoted as
g  g, whose elements, m  g, admit a unique decomposition in the form

m = m+ m 1


with

m = e,

(3.76)

(3.77)

where  varies in a neighbourhood of zero in g. on g one has

m 1dm = m(cid:16)m 1

+ dm+  m 1

 dm(cid:17) m 1

 .

let x be an arbitrary vector eld on g. by means of (3.73), (3.77) leads to

m 1

 dm(x) =(cid:16)m 1

 m 1dm(x)m(cid:17)

.

(3.78)

on the right hand side the subscript refers to the decomposition (3.74).

according to [14], the denition

(m) :=

1
2

yields a 2-form on g for which

tr(cid:16)m 1

+ dm+  m 1

 dm(cid:17)

(3.79)

d =

1
6

tr (cid:16)m 1dm  m 1dm  m 1dm(cid:17)

on

g.

(3.80)

it is straightforward to verify (3.80) by using (3.78), (3.73) and the antisymmetry of the r-
matrix, which imply e.g. that tr (a+[b+, c+]) = tr (a[b, c]) for any a, b, c  g.

16

coming now to the main point, let us dene mchir  mchir to be the submanifold where
the monodromy matrix is restricted to g. thanks to (3.80),  in (3.79) yields a symplectic
chir by (2.27). it is stated in [14] (without a proof) that the pb (3.62) on mchir that
form 
results is in this case governed by the same constant r-matrix r out of which  (3.79) has been
constructed. our formalism permits us to prove this important result as follows.

first, we need to rewrite the 2-form  in (3.79) in the notation used in (3.20). with the aid

of (3.78), we obtain that

q(m) = w (m)rw (m 1

 ).

(3.81)

where we employ the notation of (3.3). here r refers to the solution of (3.71) that we used
to dene , and we have to show that this monodromy independent r-matrix also solves the
dening equation of the exchange r-matrix, eq. (3.36).

as a consequence of (3.81), for the operators r and q that appear in (3.36) we have

by using this together with m = m+m 1
(3.36) becomes equivalent to

 (3.76) and ad m = exp (ad ), the desired identity

q(m) = ad (m)  r  ad (m 1
 ).

(3.82)

because of (3.75), the last equation is in turn equivalent to

r+  exp (ad )  r = r  exp (ad +)  r+.

r+  r  exp (adr) = r  r+  exp (adr) ,

(3.83)

(3.84)

which is obviously valid since the operators r+ and r commute. this proves that the constant
r-matrix underlying  in (3.79) does indeed coincide with the exchange r-matrix associated by
(3.36) with the corresponding symplectic form 

chir.

a well-known feature of a constant exchange r-matrix is that it naturally admits a poisson-
lie action of the group g on mchir. observe that if r in (3.62) is independent of m, then the
poisson structure on mchir smoothly extends to a poisson structure on the full mchir. at the
same time, one can give g the structure of a pl group by the denition [33, 34]

{h , h} =

1


[r, h  h]

h  g.

(3.85)

then one obtains a natural (left) pl action of g on mchir by the map

mchir  g  (g, h) 7 gh1  mchir.

(3.86)
indeed, this is a poisson map if mchirg carries the direct product of the exchange algebra pb
on mchir and the sklyanin bracket (3.85) on g. in the present case, the meaning of eqs. (3.51)-
(3.54) is that mchir  g 7 m = g1(x)g(x + 2) provides the non-abelian momentum map
[14, 32] for this pl action. (of course, an equivalent right pl action is obtained by replacing
h1 with h and using the opposite of the pb on g.)

the above mechanism cannot be used to dene a pl symmetry on mchir in the case of a
compact lie group g, since (3.71) has no solution for a compact g. this is somewhat puzzling
since as a quantum eld theory the wznw model is usually considered in the compact domain,
where various manifestations of quantum group symmetries were found in the literature [16].
later we shall see that pl symmetries can be dened on the chiral wznw phase space by
certain mechanisms dierent from the one described above, and they work in the compact case
too.

17

3.5 a parametrization of mchir and classical g-symmetry

we below introduce local coordinates on the chiral wznw phase space consisting of a periodic
g-valued eld and the logarithm, , of the monodromy matrix. this will lead us to realize the
existence of a special choice of  such that with respect to 
chir  generates an innitesimal
symplectic action of g on mchir, i.e., a classical g-symmetry. the parametrization will also
shed a new light on the notion of admissible hamiltonians.
if the monodromy matrix m is near to e  g, then the chiral wznw eld can be uniquely
(3.87)

g(x) = h(x)ex,

parametrized as

where h(x) is a g-valued, smooth, 2-periodic function and  varies in a neighbourhood of zero
in g, g  g, for which the map g   7 m = e2  g  g is a dieomorphism. we may
identify a domain in mchir with the corresponding space of parameters,

an easy computation gives the following formula for chir (2.17) in this parametrization:

mchir = eg  g = {(h, )}.
chir(h, )  0(),

chir(h, ) = 0

upon comparison with (2.18), this implies that d0
chir = 0, which one can check directly as well.
recalling eq. (2.28), we then notice that the 2-form  in (2.27) in this case can be parametrized
by an arbitrary closed 2-form  on g as

() = 0() + (),

d() = 0.

(3.93)

by (2.27) we thus have 
chir. in order to determine
the exchange r-matrix, r0, corresponding to 0, we note that the integral dening 0 can be
computed in closed form. in fact, the linear operator, q0, associated with its matrix in (3.21)
according to (3.2) turns out to be4

chir + , in particular 0

chir = 0

chir = 0

q0 =

2y + ey  ey
2(ey  1)(1  ey )

with

y := 2(ad ).

(3.94)

4the expressions in eqs. (3.94), (3.95) are dened by the power series expansions of the corresponding

complex analytic functions around zero. for instance [35], 2r0 =p

r0 =

(3.95)

by means of (3.62) this r-matrix denes one of the possible monodromy dependent exchange
algebras for the chiral wzwn eld, and it also represents a nontrivial solution of (3.63). in the
knowledge of the r-matrix, the pbs containing m can be determined straightforwardly from
(3.51), (3.53). in particular, it is easy to see that the hamiltonian vector eld generated by the
function  = tr (t) gives rise to the pbs

{g(x), } = g(x)t

and {, } = f 





for

 := 2 .

(3.96)

this means that in the case of the symplectic form 0
chir the logarithm of m generates a
classical g-symmetry on mchir. indeed, the momentum map corresponding to this symmetry
is just . a classical g-symmetry is sometimes called abelian to contrast it with a proper
(non-abelian) pl symmetry, for which the symmetry group itself is endowed with a nonzero
pb [32].

the above construction is valid for any simple lie group. perhaps even more surprisingly
than the possibility to dene a classical g-symmetry on mchir for any g, in sec. 5 it will turn
out that the symplectic structure on mchir can be chosen so as to be compatible with any
prescribed pl structure on g.
now we explain how the characterization of the admissible hamiltonians found in sec. 3.2
appears in the coordinates (h, ). for this, we rst remark that on account of (3.88) it is
natural to represent a vector eld x on mchir as

x = (xh, x)

x  g

(3.97)

xh  theg

with h1xh  eg. by regarding h and  as evaluation functions, we may write xh = x(h)
and x = x(). of course, the derivative x(f ) of function f on mchir with respect to x is
still dened by means of a curve to which x is tangent. let us call a function f periodically
dierentiable if its derivative with respect to any x exists and has the form

x(f ) = hdf, xi = tr (df x) +z 2

0

tr (cid:16)(h1dhf )(h1xh)(cid:17)

with the exterior derivative

df = (dhf, df )

h eg
dhf  t 

df  g,

where h1dhf  eg by the natural identications. our point then is that the periodically
dierentiable functions coincide precisely with the admissible hamiltonians. to prove this,
recall that the denition of an admissible hamiltonian was that its derivative exists with respect
to any vector eld and has the form (3.26), where af assigns to any g  mchir a smooth g-
valued function on r such that (3.29) gives a 2-periodic function, and af is given by (3.31).
if we now suppose that the derivative of a function f has the form in (3.26), where af (x) is

(3.98)

(3.99)

19

a smooth function on r, then by inserting the parametrization (3.87) and performing a few
partial integrations we obtain

0

dx tr (cid:16)x(gg1)af(cid:17) + tr (cid:16)g1(0)x(g(0))af(cid:17)
dx tr (cid:16)(cid:16)x(h)h1(cid:17)(cid:16)(af )  [af , gg1](cid:17)(cid:17)

for any vector eld x on mchir. clearly, this formula can be rewritten in the form of (3.98) if
and only if
(3.101)

af + g1(0)[af (2)  af (0)]g(0) = 0,
 (dhf )h1 = (af ) + [af , gg1]

(g1af g)(x)(cid:19)

dx (h1af h)(x)(cid:19) .

the last equality follows by an easy calculation, and it implies that

df = z 2

0

(h1af h)(x).

(3.102)

(3.103)

(3.104)

we conclude that a function f for which x(f ) has the form of the rst line in (3.100) is peri-
odically dierentiable if and only if (3.101) is satised and the right hand side of (3.102) denes
a smooth, 2-periodic function. in particular, all admissible hamiltonians are periodically dif-
ferentiable. conversely, every periodically dierentiable function is admissible in the sense of
sec. 3.2 since it is possible to uniquely determine (af , af ) in terms of (dhf, df ) in such a way
(3.98) is converted into the rst line of (3.100). to achieve this, if (dhf, df ) are given, one
has to solve the dierential equation (3.102) together with the condition in (3.104) for af (x),
and then one may dene af by (3.101). it is not dicult to show that, since  is restricted
to g, (3.104) has a unique solution for the initial value af (0) of af (x), which completes the
proof.

4 kinematical derivation of the poisson brackets

in this section we rederive the pbs of the chirally extended wznw model using purely kine-
matical considerations. instead of explicitly inverting the symplectic form, we postulate the
natural properties of the chiral extension (which we have established in the symplectic formal-
ism) and this way we can reproduce the quadratic exchange algebras (3.62) and (3.68) almost

20

eortlessly. this is especially so in the case of bloch waves, where the dynamical r-matrix
(3.69) is determined algebraically. the subsequent considerations are complementary to the
symplectic approach presented in sec. 3 and, for bloch waves, in [22]. the kinematical deriva-
tion sheds a new light on the origin of the chiral exchange algebras, and some issues are also
easier to discuss in this approach.

we have seen in sec. 2 that it is very natural to extend the wznw phase space as

m  msol  mext = ml  mr ,

(4.1)
where ml and mr are two identical copies of the chiral phase space characterized by the
smooth, quasiperiodic chiral elds gc(x + 2) = gc(x) mc , c = l, r. since the separation
of the chiral degrees of freedom is an essential feature of the wznw model, we shall assume
that ml and mr are independent and they are equipped with the same symplectic structure
(up to an overall sign dierence, see eq. (2.16)). the corresponding poisson algebra will be
supposed to contain the important hamiltonians f,  and f studied in sec. 3.3. the further
main assumptions of the kinematical approach are that the constraints ml = mr are rst class
and the corresponding gauge transformations5 operate according to (2.10) so that the wznw
solution g(,  ) = gl(xl) g1
r (xr) is gauge invariant. these assumptions, together with simple
properties of the original wznw phase space msol, allow us to reproduce the pbs (3.62) and
(3.68).

4.1 the chiral poisson brackets for generic monodromy

from now on we mainly concentrate on the chiral half of the problem and, for notational
simplicity, omit the subscript c, wherever it is possible.

we start by noting that because the fourier components of the left km current belong to
the space of admissible hamiltonians, acting on the left chiral eld they must generate the
transformation

nj n
t , g(x)o = t einxg(x) ,

where

j n

t :=z 2

0

dx einxtr (t j(x)) ,

(4.2)

which means that the chiral eld is a km primary eld. this crucial relation can be obtained
by rst noting that on the submanifold of mext dened by imposing the constraint ml = mr
(2.21) holds for the product (2.8) that gives the wznw solution. the gauge invariance of the
solution eld and the fact that the dierent chiral pieces completely poisson commute then
allow us to derive (4.2). of course, an analogous relation is valid for the right-moving elds.

an other quantity which, by assumption, belongs to the space of admissible hamiltonians

is the monodromy matrix m. from (4.2) it follows that

nj n
t , mo = 0 ,

(4.3)

which is obvious because m is invariant under the km transformations. for later use we
note that a quantity which poisson commutes with the fourier components of the km current

5 in the rest of the paper, when considering gauge transformations or g-symmetries, we shall always assume
that the domain of allowed monodromy matrices, g  g, consists of full conjugacy classes in g. if this did not
hold, everything would still be true for innitesimal gauge transformations or g-symmetries.

(4.4)

where the matrix valued test function (x) satises (3.58). note that while in the symplectic
approach of sec. 3 the fact that f is an admissible hamiltonian follows from the properties of
the symplectic form, here it is an additional assumption. in order to compute the pbs with f
it is enough to nd

(4.5)
for 0  x  2 (b(x) corresponds to y f(g(x)) in sec. 3.3). to constrain b(x) we apply
(4.2) to f and then using the fact that f is an admissible hamiltonian we obtain the local
form

b(x) :=nf, g(x)o

nf, j(x)o = tr(cid:16)(x)t g(x)(cid:17)t .

comparing (4.5) and (4.6) leads to the dierential equation

where r = r. by means of (4.12), (4.8) becomes equivalent to the classical exchange

22

where the r-matrix r = rt  t is an x-independent constant. of course, as before, (4.13)
has to be interpreted in the distributional sense.
although x-independent, the r-matrix can still depend on the phase space. this latter
t with (4.13) and applying the jacobi

dependence can be restricted by poisson commuting j n
identity. in this way we get

(4.14)

t , ro = 0 ,
nj n

which implies, as explained earlier, that r must be a function of m alone.

next we consider the pbs of the monodromy matrix. using (4.5), (4.8) and (4.12) we get

nf, mo = g1(x)(cid:16)b(2)b(0)m(cid:17) =

1


(cid:18) 1

2

(mt  + t m) + r(mt  tm)(cid:19) (4.15)

and because m is an admissible hamiltonian this implies the local form

ng(x) , mo =

1


g(x)  m (m) ,

where  is given by (3.52). we obtain in a similar way that

nm , mo =

1


m  m (m)

with  dened in (3.54).

to ascertain that our construction is self-consistent, we now show that

c = ml  mr  0

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

is a rst class constraint on mext and the wznw solution is gauge invariant. in fact, c is rst
class since

nc , co = nml

=

1


, mlo +nmr
(ml  mr(cid:17) (ml) 

, mro
(cid:16)mr  mr(cid:17) (mr)  0 .

1

similarly, the gauge invariance of g(,  ) in (2.8) can be shown as follows:

ng(,  ) , co = (cid:16)gl(xl)  ml(cid:17) (ml)(cid:16)g1
r (xr)  1(cid:17)
 (cid:16)gl(xl)  mr(cid:17) (mr)(cid:16)g1
r (xr)  1(cid:17)
 (cid:16)gl(xl)  m(cid:17)(cid:16) (ml)  (mr)(cid:17)(cid:16)g1

r (xr)  1(cid:17)  0 .
here the notation  indicates weak equality, i.e., equality on the constrained manifold, and
we used the assumption that ml and mr are independent and carry opposite pbs.
for later use we mention an additional consistency check. consider the path ordered integral
e = e(2) dened in (3.42). since e and m are related by conjugation, their invariants
coincide:
(4.19)

n = tr (cid:16)e n(cid:17) = tr (cid:16)m n(cid:17) = mn ,

23

and since the pbs of the hamiltonians n can be calculated unambiguously using the km
algebra only, the following relation must hold:

ng(x), mno =ng(x), no =

n


g(x)t tr(cid:16)m n t(cid:17) .

(4.20)

it is easy to verify by using (3.52) in (4.16) that (4.20) is indeed satised.

to summarize, by postulating the ml = mr constraint to be rst class, as well as the
admissible hamiltonian nature of the fourier components of the current, the smeared out
chiral eld and the monodromy matrix, we have established that the possible extensions of the
wznw phase space correspond to the quadratic exchange algebra (4.13) with some monodromy
dependent exchange r-matrix. of course the classical exchange algebra can only provide a valid
pb if it satises the jacobi identity. this is guaranteed, by construction, if the r-matrix
is obtained as a solution of (3.36).
in the present approach, we have to impose the jacobi
condition and, as mentioned in sec. 3.3, this leads to the dynamical yb equation (3.63). the
chiral extensions of the wznw model are thus characterized by the solutions of this equation.
most known solutions of (3.63) are local in that they are dened only on a proper, open
submanifold g  g. this is obviously the case for the solutions obtained by solving (3.36)
for the r-matrix, starting from a q-matrix representing by (3.21) a local solution of (2.28). on
the other hand, as the example of constant r-matrices shows, there are global solutions as well.
since constant solutions exist for non-compact groups only, an interesting open question is
whether there exist globally dened exchange r-matrices also for compact groups. we hope to
return to this question in a future study.

we end this subsection by discussing a generalization of the gauge freedom (2.10) of the

chiral extension. it is clear that the gauge transformed chiral elds given by

g(x)  (pg)(x) = g(x) p(m)

(4.21)

with an arbitrary monodromy dependent group element p(m) correspond to the same point
in the physical phase space after the projection (2.11), provided we apply the same gauge
transformation to both chiral elds.
in other words, both the original elds, g(x), and the
gauge transformed elds, g(x) := g(x) p(m), are smooth quasiperiodic g-valued coordinates
of the same point in the physical phase space.

the multiplication law for two elements, p1,p2, of this huge gauge group is given by

p12(m) = p2(m) p1(p2m) ,

(4.22)

where p1, p2 and p12 correspond to p1,p2 and p12 := p1p2 := p1  p2, respectively. here

pm := p1(m)mp(m)

(4.23)

is how the monodromy matrix itself is transformed under a gauge transformation. to qualify as
an element of the gauge group we must also require that the inverse transformation exists. this
is equivalent to requiring that the group valued function, p(m), corresponding to the inverse
element, p 1, exists and solves

(4.24)

p(m)p(pm) = e .

24

in terms of the new coordinates g(x) dened by (4.21) the exchange algebra has the same
form as (4.13) with a gauge transformed exchange r-matrix, r. on account of the leibniz rule
of the pb, one nds that

r = p1(m) p1(m)(cid:16)r(m) + [t a a  t] + a a(cid:17)p(m) p(m) , (4.25)
where a := (rp)p1 and r should be expressed as a function of the gauge transformed
monodromy m := pm. since the jacobi identity of the exchange algebra (4.13) is independent
of the coordinates used, it is clear that the solutions of the dynamical yb equation (3.63) are
transformed into each other by the elements of the gauge group and therefore can be classied
up to gauge transformations.

4.2 diagonal monodromy

below we briey outline a kinematical derivation of the pbs on the space of chiral wznw
bloch waves, mbloch dened in (3.66). in order to emphasize their diagonality, we denote the
monodromy matrices of the bloch waves, b(x), here by d,

d = ekhk ,

(4.26)

where hk are the basis elements of a splitting cartan subalgebra of g. we will also use the
derivatives k = 
the assumptions and the main steps of the construction (with obvious modications for the
diagonal case) are the same as discussed above for the general case. now we obtain a classical
exchange algebra of the form

k .

nb(x) , b(y)o =

1


b(x)  b(y)(cid:16)r() +

1
2

i sign(y  x)(cid:17),

0 < x, y < 2.

(4.27)

the main dierence comes from requiring (4.20), because, unlike in the general case where
it was a consequence of the exchange algebra, here it completely determines the pbs of the
monodromy matrix:

on the other hand, the analogue of (4.16) implied by (4.27) now reads explicitly as

nb(x) , do =

1


(b(x)  d) (hk  h k) .

(4.28)

(4.29)

nb(x) , do =

1


(b(x)  d)(cid:16)r() +

1
2

i  (1  d1)(r() 

1
2

i)(1  d)(cid:17).

the comparison of the last two equations xes the exchange r-matrix almost completely:

r() = r() + x() ,

where r() is given by (3.69) and x() is an antisymmetric purely cartan piece,

x() = x kl()hk  hl ,

x kl() = x lk() .

thus we have determined the exchange r-matrix algebraically up to the cartan piece.

(4.30)

(4.31)

25

the jacobi identity takes the following form for the diagonal case:

[r12(), r23()] + h k

1 k r23() + cycl. perm. = 

f .

1
4

(4.32)

this is the celebrated cdyb equation, whose neutral solutions have been classied in [23]. the
r-matrix (4.30) satises (4.32) if

therefore there exists a gauge vector vk() such that

kxlm + lxmk + mxkl = 0.

with the help of vk() we can introduce the gauge transformed chiral eld

xkl() = kvl()  lvk().

b(x) = b(x)evk()h k

,

(4.33)

(4.34)

(4.35)

which has diagonal monodromy and satises the standard exchange algebra

nb(x) , b(y)o =

1


b(x)  b(y)(cid:16) r() +

1
2

i sign(y  x)(cid:17) ,

0 < x, y < 2 .

(4.36)

it has been mentioned that the pb (4.36) follows [22] from the symplectic form bloch(b)
on mbloch given by (3.67). upon the substitution (4.35), the symplectic form gets shifted by
the exact 2-form xkl() dk  dl and the shifted symplectic form corresponds of course to
the exchange algebra (4.27) with r() in (4.30). it is also easy to see that the family of the
symplectic forms (cid:16)bloch(b) + xkl()k  l(cid:17) on mbloch results as the reduction of the family

of symplectic forms 

chir to diagonal monodromy.

5 exchange r-matrices with poisson-lie symmetry

we studied in sec. 3.4 the poisson-lie action of the group g on the chiral phase space for the
special case of a constant r-matrix playing the role of the exchange r-matrix. as mentioned
there, this pl action is restricted to the case of complex or real, non-compact groups, since
there is no constant solution of (3.63) for compact groups. in this section we consider a set of
more general pl actions which also work for the physically most interesting case of compact
groups.

it is clear from the examples studied so far that the pl action we are looking for is a
kind of hidden symmetry, extending and centralizing the kac-moody symmetries in the total
symmetry group of the chiral wznw model. more precisely, we require that

 the km currents are invariant under the pl action;
 the pl action commutes with the km transformations.

26

it is not dicult to see that because of the above two requirements the pl action as a nonlin-
ear group action on the chiral phase space has to be a special case of the gauge transformations
discussed in sec. 4.1:

g(x)  phg(x) = g(x)p(m, h)

h  g.

(5.1)

the g-valued function p(m, h) is chosen so that the group multiplication law phpk = phk is
satised:
(5.2)
where the induced action on the monodromy matrix is pkm = p1(m, k)mp(m, k). one must
also require that p(m, e) = e.

p(m, k)p(pkm, h) = p(m, hk) ,

the simplest case is the standard (left) action

corresponding to p(m, h) = h1. a family of trivial actions is obtained by conjugating the
standard action in the gauge group by an arbitrary element p (see (4.21)):

shg(x) = g(x)h1

(5.3)

in terms of the corresponding g-valued functions we have

sh = p 1shp.

s(m, h) = p(m)h1 p(h  pm  h1) .

(5.4)

(5.5)

in practice it is useful to consider the innitesimal version of (5.1). for the parametrization

h = eut we have

phg(x) = g(x)  uxg(x) + o(u2) ,

where the innitesimal generators are of the form
xg(x) =  
with some monodromy dependent coecients  
[x, x] = f
 



 as

(m)g(x)t

(m), and satisfy the commutation relations
 x. this latter equation can be expressed as a requirement on the coecients

the innitesimal generators are also useful in studying the question of trivialization. the

it is easy to see that the consistency conditions of this set of partial dierential equations are
precisely the equations (5.8), but it is not clear if all possible nonlinear actions ph can be
trivialized in the form (5.4) or not.
the next question is which of the above nonlinear group actions are poisson-lie? following
[32], we recall that a lie group (or algebra) action characterized by innitesimal generators x
is poisson-lie, if for any pair of phase space functions f1, f2 the pbs satisfy the relations

nx(f1), f2o +nf1, x(f2)o  x(cid:16){f1, f2}(cid:17) =  f 

 x(f1) x(f2) ,

(5.10)

27

where the pair of structure constants (f
this to f1 = g(x), f2 = g(y) and parametrizing the exchange r-matrix as

) together dene a lie bi-algebra. now applying

with some constant parameter 2. this parametrization of the right hand side will prove
useful below. the value  = 0 is also allowed and for real lie groups 2 is of course real. from
the classication [30, 31] of the solutions we recall that for a compact simple lie algebra  must
be purely imaginary or zero, while for the maximally non-compact (split) real forms  is real.

also verify directly that the standard left action of g equipped with the pb (5.13) is pl for
the exchange r-matrix (5.18) if k(m) is equivariant.

so far we have established that the action (5.3) of g on mchir is pl if r(m) is the sum of a
constant r-matrix r and an equivariant piece k(m). of course, the exchange r-matrix (5.18)
has to be a solution of the dynamical yb equation (3.63). using (5.19), (3.63) can be rewritten

pl group g equipped with the pb (5.13), is one of our main results.

2   coth (y) .

we conclude this section with a couple of remarks related to the above r-matrices. we
rst note that for  = 0 (5.22) is understood as the appropriate limit and therefore for r = 0
we recover from (5.18) the exchange r-matrix r0 (3.95) together with the classical g-symmetry
discussed in sec. 3.5. we can also have  = 0 in correspondence with any antisymmetric solution
r 6= 0 of the classical yb equation. for  = 1/2 we get k = 0 and the dynamical r-matrix
(5.18) then reduces to one of the constant r-matrices treated in sec. 3.4. for compact groups
all solutions (5.22) are strictly dynamical (non-constant), since in this case 2  0. finally,
we remark that the existence of a suitable local 2-form  corresponding to the r-matrix (5.18),
(5.22) is guaranteed by the solvability of (3.36).

we have seen that the classical g-symmetries discussed in sec. 3.5 and the special pl
symmetries treated in sec. 3.4 are generated by momentum maps. without going into details,
we wish to mention that it is possible to show the existence of a non-abelian momentum map
also in the general case of the above pl symmetries. the momentum map is given by a function
m(m) on mchir (depending on the monodromy matrix only), which takes its values in the dual
pl group g in such a way that for all phase space functions f

xf =(cid:16)m1{m, f}(cid:17)

,

(5.23)

where the () component on the right hand side is evaluated in the dual lie-algebra, g.
moreover, the g-valued momentum map satises the pbs
{m , m} = (m)m  m ,

(5.24)
where the poisson tensor (m)  g g is chosen so that (5.24) denes the poisson structure
of the dual pl group. (for an explanation of these notions, see e.g. [32].)
it is in principle possible to use the the momentum map construction also backwards. if
there is a g-valued function m on the phase space satisfying (5.24), then using (5.23) to dene
an innitesimal generator x one obtains that

29



 x,

 the innitesimal generators represent the lie algebra, [x, x] = f
 the lie algebra action is pl, i.e., (5.10) holds.
let now suppose that a compact simple lie algebra g acts on a phase space as a classical
symmetry generated by a g-valued, equivariant (abelian) momentum map. in this situation
one can always dene also an innitesimal pl action of the group g equipped with the so called
standard pl structure. this is a consequence of the fact [36] that there exists a dieomorphism
between g and g that converts the natural linear poisson structure on g into the standard
pl structure on g. applying this to the classical g-symmetry studied in sec. 3.5, we can thus
nd a map,
(5.25)
where  : mchir  g is given by (3.96), such that m() satises (5.24) with respect to the
standard pl structure. the resulting g-valued momentum map then generates a pl action
on the phase space mchir as outlined above.
this somewhat surprising construction is not specic to the chiral wznw phase space,
since it can be used whenever one has a classical g-symmetry based on a compact simple lie
algebra. when applying it to the chiral wznw phase space, the lie algebra action (5.23)
constructed using the momentum map (5.25) will be dierent from the standard one (5.3).
it is an interesting question whether this lie algebra action can be gauge transformed to the
standard form and, if the answer is positive, to nd the corresponding gauge transform of the
r-matrix r0 (3.95). we wish to discuss this in a future publication.

6 interpretation in terms of poisson-lie groupoids

the cdyb equation (4.32) can be regarded as the guarantee of the jacobi identity in a pl
groupoid [23]. below we show that eq. (3.63) admits an analogous interpretation. for this, we
introduce a family of pl groupoids in such a way that a subfamily of these is naturally associated
with the possible pbs on the chiral wznw phase space. remarkably, these groupoids are
nite dimensional poisson manifolds that encode practically all information about the innite
dimensional chiral wznw pbs.

roughly speaking, a groupoid is a set, say p , endowed with a partial multiplication that
behaves similarly to a group multiplication in the cases when it can be performed. to under-
stand the following construction one does not need to know details of the notion of a groupoid
(see e.g. [37]), since we shall only use the most trivial example of such a structure, for which

p = s  g  s = {(m f , g, m i)},

(6.1)

where g is a group and s is some set. the partial multiplication is dened for those triples
(m f , g, m i) and ( m f , g, m i) for which m i = m f , and the product is

(m f , g, m i)( m f , g, m i) := (m f , gg, m i )

for m i = m f .

in other words, the graph of the partial multiplication is the subset of

p  p  p = {(m f , g, m i)}  {( m f , g, m i )}  {( m f , g, m i )}

(6.2)

(6.3)

30

dened by the constraints

m i = m f ,

m f = m f ,

m i = m i,

g = gg,

(6.4)

where the hatted triple encodes the components of the product. a pl groupoid [38] p is a
groupoid and a poisson manifold in such a way that the graph of the partial multiplication is
a coisotropic submanifold of p  p  p , where p  denotes the manifold p endowed with the
opposite of the pb on p . in other words, this means that the constraints that dene the graph
are rst class. this denition reduces to that of a pl group in the particular case for which
the set s in (6.1) consists of a single point.

in the interpretation of (3.70) given in [23] the groupoid p is of the form above with s
taken to be a domain in the dual of a cartan subalgebra of a simple lie group g. by thinking
about a generic monodromy matrix, we now take p to be

(6.5)
where g is some open domain in g. on this p , we postulate a pb { , }p dened, by using the
usual tensorial notation, as follows:

p = g  g  g,

{g1, g2}p = g1g2r(m i)  r(m f )g1g2
{g1, m i
{g1, m f
1 , m i

(m f )g1
2 }p = m f
1 m i
2}p = m i
2
2 }p = m f
1 m f
2
2 }p = 0.

(m f )

(m i)

(6.6)

here  is an arbitrary constant included for comparison purposes. the structure functions r,
,  are g  g valued functions on g; in components

r(m) = r(m)t  t,

(m) = (m)t  t,

(m) = (m)t  t.

(6.7)

it is quite easy to verify that a pb given by the ansatz (6.6) always yields a pl groupoid,
since the constraints in (6.4) will be rst class for any choice of the structure functions. of
course, the structure functions must satisfy a system of equations in order for the above ansatz
to dene a pb. the antisymmetry of the pb is ensured by

r = r21

(r21 := rt  t)

and

 =  21,

while the jacobi identity is, in fact, equivalent to the following system of equations:

1 r r23 + cycl. perm. =  f,  = constant,
1 r 23 + cycl. perm. = 0,

[r12, r13] + t 
[ 12, 13] + t 
[r12, 13 + 23] + [ 13, 23] + t 
[ 12 + 13, 23] + [ 12, 13] + t 

3 r r12 + (t

3 r 12  t 

2 r 13) = 0,
2 r 13) = 0.

(6.8)

(6.9)

(6.10)

(6.11)

(6.12)

observe that the left hand side of (6.9) is of the same form as that of (3.63), but in the groupoid
context on the right hand side we have an arbitrary constant . the derivation of the above

31

equations from the various instances of the jacobi identity is not dicult. what is somewhat
miraculous is that one does not obtain more equations than these. this is actually ensured by
our choice of the relationship between the pbs that involve m i and those that involve m f . as
an illustration, let us explain how (6.9) is derived. by evaluating

one obtains that this is equivalent to

{{g1, g2}p , g3}p + cycl. perm. = 0,

g1g2g3(cid:16)[r12, r13] + t 
=(cid:16)[r12, r13] + t 

1 r r23 + cycl. perm.(cid:17) (m i ) =
1 r r23 + cycl. perm.(cid:17) (m f )g1g2g3.

this holds if and only if the expression in the parenthesis is a constant, ad-invariant element
of 3(g), and  f is the only such element for a simple lie algebra g.
we have seen that the chiral wznw pbs are encoded by equations (3.62), (4.16) and
(4.17), where  and  are dened by (3.52) and (3.54) respectively in terms of a solution r
of (3.63). now our point is the following: a pl groupoid can be naturally associated with any
poisson structure on the chiral wznw phase space by taking the triple r, ,  that arises in
the wznw model to be the structure functions of a pl groupoid according to (6.6).

it can be checked that the jacobi identities of the pl groupoid (6.9)(6.12) are satised
for any triple r, ,  that arises in the wznw model. this actually follows without any
computation since, indeed, the jacobi identities of the chiral wznw pbs in (3.62), (4.16),
(4.17) lead to the same equations, with  =  1
4, and they are satised since they follow from
the symplectic form 

chir.

among the chiral wznw pl groupoids described above there are those special cases for
which k = r  r satises the equivariance condition (5.20) in relation with some constant
r-matrix r subject to (5.15). in these cases, we equip the group g = {h} with the sklyanin
bracket opposite to that in (5.13),

{h , h} =

1

hh  h, ri,

and consider its commuting right and left actions on p given respectively by the maps

p  g  ((m f , g, m i), h) 7 (m f , gh, h1m ih)  p

and

g  p  (h, (m f , g, m i)) 7 (hm f h1, hg, m i)  p.

then it is not dicult to verify that these are both poisson maps, i.e., they dene two pl
actions of the pl group g (with (6.15)) on the pl groupoid p . in the nal analysis, this is a
consequence of the fact that, as explained in sec. 5, in the present situation we have a pl action
of g on the chiral wznw phase space whose poisson structure is encoded by (p,{ , }p ). here
g  g must be ad -invariant, see footnote 5.
in [23] pl groupoids are associated with arbitrary subalgebras k  g, although the cor-
responding dynamical r-matrices are described only if k is a cartan subalgebra. the k = g
special case of their groupoids is in fact equivalent to our pl groupoid whose structure function
is the r-matrix in (3.95). their pl groupoids are dierent from ours in general.

7 conclusion

in this paper we explored the poisson structures on the chiral wznw phase space of group
valued quasiperiodic elds with generic monodromy. we have shown that the possible pbs are
dened by the exchange r-matrices that are solutions of (3.63). this equation can be viewed
as an analogue of the celebrated cdyb equation (3.70), since the latter plays a similar role for
chiral wznw elds with diagonal monodromy. an analysis of chiral wznw bloch waves and
their classical wakimoto realizations in the spirit of the present paper is contained in [22].

we have given an interpretation of our dynamical yb equation (3.63) in terms of a family of
pl groupoids, whose further study may be fruitful. in this respect, the most interesting open
questions appear to be to quantize these pl groupoids and to nd applications for them outside
the chiral wznw context. it is known that equation (3.70) admits interesting applications in
the eld of integrable systems [27].

we also investigated the pl symmetries of the exchange algebra (3.62). we have found that
for any pl structure on the wznw group g there is a corresponding choice of the exchange
r-matrix such that the standard gauge action of g on the chiral elds becomes a pl action. it
would be desirable to understand if this result has any analogue at the level of the quantized
(chiral) wznw model.

a exchange r-matrices for su (2)

in this appendix we present an explicit, local formula for the most general exchange r-matrix
on the simplest compact lie group g = su(2). the formula (a.15) below is valid in a neigh-
bourhood of the unit element. it illustrates some general results obtained in sec. 3, and it may
prove useful in a future study of the question whether globally dened exchange r-matrices
exist for su(2) or not.

as a basis for the lie algebra su(2), we choose the generators t a := 1

2ia, where the a
(a = 1, 2, 3) are the usual pauli matrices. we parametrize the matrices rab(m) and qab(m)
that appear in (3.36) in terms of 3-component vectors as

rab = abcrc

and

qab = abcqc,

(a.1)

where abc is the totally antisymmetric tensor for which 123 = 1. furthermore, we identify the
su(2) group manifold with s3  r4 by writing m  su(2) according to

m = x00 + ixaa ,

x2
0 + xaxa = 1,

(a.2)

whereby x0, xa dene smooth functions on su(2) (0 is the 2  2 unit matrix). it is then a
matter of straightforward calculation to translate eq. (3.37) into the formula

ra =

1
4

d1(cid:16)xa + 4x0qa + 4abcxbqc(cid:17) ,

33

d := x0  4xaqa,

(a.3)

which is valid on a neighbourhood of the unit element where d 6= 0. by assumption, on this
neighbourhood the qa are smooth functions subject to

d(m) =

1
6

tr(m 1dm)3

for (m) =

1
2

qab(m)tr(tam 1dm)  tr(tbm 1dm).

(a.4)

as discussed in sec. 3.3, (a.4) implies that ra dened by (a.1), (a.3) yields a solution of the
dynamical yb equation (3.63), which for su(2) can actually be written in the form

2rara +

1
2da+ra + abcrcd

b ra = 

1
8

.

(a.5)

observe that we cannot have a constant solution since the ra must be real. it is also worth
noting that locally we have the inverse of (a.3) given by

qa =

1
4

d1(cid:16)xa + 4x0ra + 4abcxbrc(cid:17) ,

d := x0 + 4xara.

(a.6)

this formula denes via (a.1) a solution of (a.4) out of any solution of (a.5).

we shall now derive the general local solution of (a.5) by making explicit the general local
solution (3.93) of (a.4) that we have obtained in sec. 3.5 for any group. for this we need the
exponential parametrization of su(2),

m = e2 = e2at a

with

||2 = aa < 1,

which covers the domain su(2) \ {0}. upon comparison with (a.2), we get

x0 = cos(||),

xa = 

a
||

sin(||).

(a.7)

(a.8)

we shall also use the following expressions for the powers of the operator ad. for the odd
powers, we have

(ad)2n+1 = (1)n||2n(ad), n  0,

(ad)(t a) = [, t a] = abctbc.

(a.9)

for the even powers, dening the matrix of (ad)n by (ad)n(t b) = [(ad)n] b

a t a, we have

[(ad)2n] b

a = (1)n||2n(cid:16)ab 

ab

||2 (cid:17), n  1.

(a.10)

using these relations, we can rewrite the formulae (3.94) and (3.95) as follows:

0 = abcq(0)
qab

c

with q(0)

c = c

and

0 = abcr(0)
rab

with r(0)

c =

8|| sin2(||)
||(cid:16) cot(||) 

c

||(cid:17) .

,

(a.11)

(a.12)

one may check that eqs. (a.3)(a.6) hold for these expressions, which represent smooth func-
tions on su(2) \ {0}.

34

to obtain the most general 2-form  on su(2) \ {0} that satises (a.4), we have to add
0 . in fact, the

an arbitrary closed 2-form to the 2-form, 0, that corresponds to the matrix qab
result can be written as

() = da  dbcba(c

sin(2||)  2||

2||3

+ uc()) ,

(a.13)

where ua() is a smooth vector-function in the interior of the unit ball, || < 1, which is
divergence free, i.e.,

3xa=1

ua()

a

= 0.

(a.14)

we then have to rewrite this 2-form in the manner indicated by the second parts of (a.1)
and (a.4). by means of (a.3), this will provide us with the general local solution of (a.5).
by performing the necessary (rather tedious) calculations, in this way we obtain the following
formula:

ra =

a

||" 1

4

cot(||) 

1

||(4  2  u)# +" a

||

(  u)  ||ua#

1

(4  2  u)2||

, (a.15)

where   u = aua. this expression is valid on the open subset of su(2) that excludes 0
and the points where   u = 2. in particular, ra is smooth in a neighbourhood of the unit
element, for which  = 0, since ua() is smooth there by assumption. one can also verify
explicitly that on its domain of validity ra solves the dynamical yb equation (a.5) for any
divergence free ua(). for this verication, one needs to spell out (a.5) more explicitly. for
instance, if one uses the xa in (a.2) as coordinates around 0  su(2), then (a.5) becomes

1  xbxb

(a.16)

in summary, we have derived the form of the most general exchange r-matrix in a neighbour-
hood of the unit element of su(2). the solution (a.15) may in general develop singularities
away from the unit element, and it is an open question if globally smooth solutions of (a.5)
exist on su(2) or not.

b analytic solution of the dynamical yb equation

in this appendix we show that the equivariant analytic function (5.22) is a solution of the
dynamical yb equation (5.21).

we will use the power series expansion of the coth function:

coth z =

1
z

+

xr=0

rz2r+1 .

(b.1)

here the coecients r can be expressed in terms of the bernoulli numbers [35]. they can also
be computed using the recursion relation

0 =

1
3

,

m = 

1

2m + 3

m1xr=0

35

rm1r ,

m = 1, 2, . . .

(b.2)

using the properties of the operator d+ (3.7) and the denition of k (5.22) the rst two

terms of (5.21) can be expanded as

xr,s=0

(kt k) =

rs(cid:16) 1
22r+2  2r+2(cid:17)(cid:16) 1
xr=0
22r+2  2r+2(cid:17) 2rxs=0 (cid:16)y
r(cid:16) 1
here, in writing the second equality we exploited that in the parametrization of m introduced
in sec. 3.5 one readily obtains by writing y = x ata that

22s+2  2s+2(cid:17)(cid:16)y 2s+1t y 2r+1(cid:17)

(b.5)

it is clear that all terms in (5.21) are built from powers of y and structure constants. it will
prove useful to contract all the indices with lie algebra generators and thus reformulate (5.21)
as an equation in the triple tensor product of the lie algebra. we introduce the notation

hk, l, mi := (y k)(y l)(y m)f t  t  t .

(b.6)

cyclic permutation of the indices now corresponds to cyclic permutation of the tensor factors
and we also introduce the symbol

[k, l, m] := hk, l, mi + hl, m, ki + hm, k, li .

(b.7)

we expand both sides of (5.21) in powers of  and every coecient of  also in powers of
y. in our notation this latter expansion corresponds to putting together all terms with a xed
total n = k + l + m, and eq. (5.21) requires separately the equality of all such terms on the
two sides.

we start with the 0 terms. we nd that the n = 0 piece is satised identically, while for

n = 2m + 2 (m = 0, 1, . . .) we get

m+1

2m+2xs=0
+ xr+k=m

(1)s+1[0, s, 2m + 2  s]  xr+s=m
2rxs=0
(1)s+1[2k + 2, s, 2r  s] = 0 .

rk

rs[0, 2s + 1, 2r + 1]

(b.8)

similarly the n = 0 piece of the 2 term vanishes identically, while for n = 2r + 2 (r = 0, 1, . . .)
we obtain

[2r + 2, 0, 0] + [0, 1, 2r + 1] + [0, 2r + 1, 1] = 0 .

(b.9)

finally, from the 2m+4 terms (for m = 0, 1, . . .) we get contributions with n = (2m + 2)-th

powers of y,

m+1

2m+2xs=0

(1)s[0, s, 2m + 2  s]  xr+s=m

36

rs[0, 2s + 1, 2r + 1] = 0,

(b.10)

and also terms with n = (2m + 4 + 2r)-th powers of y (for r = 0, 1, . . .),

[0, 2m + 3, 2r + 1] + [0, 2r + 1, 2m + 3] +

2m+2xs=0

(1)s[2r + 2, s, 2m + 2  s] = 0 .

(b.11)

before proceeding we note that using the jacobi identity for the structure constants we can

write down the following identity:

hk + 1, l, mi + hk, l + 1, mi + hk, l, m + 1i = 0 .

(b.12)

now it is easy to see that (b.9) is a special case and (b.11) is a simple consequence of the
above identity. in fact, to prove (b.11) we group [0, 2m+3, 2r+1] with the rst ([0, 2r+1, 2m+3]
with the last) m + 1 terms of the sum:

z1 = [0, 2m + 3, 2r + 1] +

z2 = [0, 2r + 1, 2m + 3] +

mxs=0
(1)s[2r + 2, s, 2m + 2  s],
mxj=0
(1)j[2r + 2, 2m + 2  j, j] ,

then in both groups, for odd s (j) we use (b.12) to write

(1)s[2r + 2, s, 2m + 2  s] = [2r + 1, s + 1, 2m + 2  s] + [2r + 1, s, 2m + 3  s],
(1)j[2r + 2, 2m + 2  j, j] = [2r + 1, 2m + 3  j, j] + [2r + 1, 2m + 2  j, j + 1].

in this form, as a consequence of (b.12), both z1 and z2 cancel telescopically almost com-
pletely; for odd m they give

z1 7 [2r + 1, m + 1, m + 2],

z2 7 [2r + 1, m + 2, m + 1],

(b.13)

while for even m we get

z1 7 [2r + 2, m, m + 2] + [2r + 1, m, m + 3],
z2 7 [2r + 2, m + 2, m] + [2r + 1, m + 3, m] .

(b.14)

one readily veries, using again (b.12), that these remaining terms give zero in both cases with
the central element of the sum (1)m+1[2r + 2, m + 1, m + 1].
as for (b.8), it should be perfectly possible to prove it using the properties of the coecients
r, but in the present context there is no need to prove it independently since we know that
the  = 0 case coincides with the solution (3.95) and therefore it must satisfy (3.63).

thus we are left with (b.10). using (b.8), we can rewrite it as

2 xr+k=m

rk[0, 2r + 1, 2k + 1] + xr+k=m

rk

2rxs=0
(1)s[2k + 2, s, 2r  s] = 0

(b.15)

and in this form we see that it trivially follows from (b.11) and the index symmetry of kr.
