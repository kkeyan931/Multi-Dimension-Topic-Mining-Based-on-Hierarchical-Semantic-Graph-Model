the aim of this note is to answer the question of s. ruijsenaars [1] concerning the rela-

tionship between the action-angle variables [2] for the rational calogero-moser model

[3] and the equivalence of the latter to free particle systems described explicitly with

the help of sl(2, r) dynamical symmetry in [4].

we begin by recalling the construction of the canonical transformation in [4]. this

construction is based on the observation that many features of the rational calogero-

moser model with the hamiltonian

hcm =

where pi, qi are the canonical variables, and g is a coupling constant, can be explained

in terms of the dynamical sl(2, r) symmetry. consider the following four functions on

the phase space:

et+ =

where  6= 0 is a parameter. one easily checks that each of the sets {t+, t, t0} and

{et+, t, t0} spans the sl(2, r) lie algebra with respect to the poisson brackets, i.e.,

{t0, t} = t,

{t, t+} = 2t0,

and

{t0, et+} = et+,

{t0, t} = t,

{t, et+} = 2t0.

these sl(2, r) algebras act on the phase space in the standard way by means of the

poisson brackets. the action can be integrated to the symplectic action of the sl(2, r)

group. in the construction of the transformation from the calogero-moser system to

free particles an important role is played by the following one-parameter family of

canonical transformations

is the hamiltonian of the calogero model, the transformation (1) can be viewed as the

time evolution generated by the calogero hamiltonian hc, with the time t = /2.

on the other hand the transformation (1) is simply a rotation in the space spanned

by t0, t about the axis t1 by an angle . thus for  =  (i.e., t = /2) we have

hcm = t+  eit1  t+ = t. next we can make a rotation in the space spanned

by t0, t, et+ about the axis et1 = i
2(et+ + t) through the angle . in particular, this
will rotate t to et+. since the latter is proportional to the hamiltonian of the free
theory h0 = pn

p2
2 , the canonical transformation obtained by the combination of
i

two rotations transforms the rational calogero-moser model to the free particle theory,

i=1

i.e.,

hcm  eiet1  (eit1  hcm ) = h0.

furthermore, this transformation sends the standard integrals of motion of the calogero-

moser model 1

to their free counterparts (obtained by setting g = 0). the same applies to the functions

tr(qlm), m = 1, . . . , n, with q = diag(q1, q2, . . . , qn ).

the ruijsenaars construction of the action-angle variables for the calogero-moser

model can be most clearly explained in terms of the hamiltonian reduction [5]. we

now briey recall how the reduction procedure can be applied to the calogero-moser

model [6]. one starts with the space of pairs (a, b) of n  n hermitian matrices. this

space is equipped with the symplectic form

 = tr(db  da).

the action of the unitary group u(n),

u  u(n) :

(a, b)  (uau , ubu ),

(4)

preserves the form  in (3) and thus is a symplectic action. the reduced phase space

is obtained with the help of the momentum map equation

i[a, b] = g(i  v  v),

v = (1, 1, . . . , 1).

using the symplectic action of the group u(n) in equation (4), one can x a gauge in

which a = diag(q1, q2, . . . , qn ). in this gauge b is the lax matrix in equation (2), and

 takes the standard form  = pn

i=1 dpi  dqi. thus we conclude that the calogero-
moser model can be obtained by the hamiltonian reduction of a simple dynamical

system in  dened by the hamiltonian h = 1

2trb2.

preserves the momentum map. following ruijsenaars we can x a gauge in which

on the other hand the symplectic transformation [7] a  ea = b, b  eb = a
ea = b is diagonal, i.e., ea = diag(i1, i2, . . . , in ).
and together with the diagonal elements 1, . . . , n of eb = a in this gauge,

form the complete set of canonical variables. thus we conclude that (i, ii) are the

i . clearly, the variables i1, . . . , in are constants of motion

in this gauge the hamiltonian

h = 1

2trb2 is h = 1

action-angle variables for the matrix model.

it is now not dicult to relate this construction of action-angle variables to that of

the canonical map [4] recalled at the beginning of this note. the action of the sl(2, r)

symmetry on the reduced phase space can be lifted to . using the explicit form of

the poisson brackets induced by the canonical form  (3), {aij, bkl} = iljk one easily

veries that the functions

t+ =

trb2,

t =

generate the sl(2, r) lie algebra, i.e., {t0, t} = t, {t, t+} = 2t0. the relationship

between the actions of sl(2, r) on the unreduced and reduced phase spaces can be

4

summarised in the following commutative diagram:

(a, b)

reduction



(q, p)

sl(2, r)



(a, b)

(q, p)

again using the explicit form of the poisson brackets one nds that t0, t act linearly

on a, b. this means that for any xed k, l, (akl, bkl) is an sl(2, r) doublet. therefore

a general sl(2, r) transformation of  can be represented as

 b (cid:19) (cid:18)  
(cid:18) a

  (cid:19)(cid:18) a

 b (cid:19) ,

   = 1.

(5)

the transformation (5) is a lift of the sl(2, r) action on the reduced phase space. thus,

in particular, the lift of the canonical transformation induced by eit1 (cf. equation (1)),

must be of the form (5). we have

 b (cid:19)  eit1 (cid:18) a
(cid:18) a

 b (cid:19) =(cid:18) 0

1 0 (cid:19)(cid:18) a

 b (cid:19) =(cid:18) 1

this shows that the ruijsenaars procedure corresponds to the lifting of the construc-

tion of the canonical mapping of the calogero-moser system to free particles in [4].

one has to keep in mind, however, that the diagonal elements of b are viewed as

momentum variables in the ruijsenaars approach while in [4] they are proportional to

the position variables. this explains the need for the additional transformation eiet1

which exchanges the momentum and position variables (and kills the factor ).

the reasoning presented above explains also in a straightforward way why the func-

tions trln = trbn and tr(qln) = tr(abn) are transformed to their free counterparts,

while it is no longer the case for tr(qmln), m  2. the point is that the trbn and

tr(abn) depend only on the eigenvalues of b and diagonal elements of a in the gauge

in which b is diagonal, while the tr(qmln), m  2 depend on non-diagonal elements

of a too.

one can quantise the matrix theory on unreduced phase space . since the action of

sl(2, r) is linear, it can easily be implemented on the quantum level too. then one can

use the quantum hamiltonian reduction [8] and carry the ruijsenaars procedure over to

the quantum case (for a dierent approach see [9]). at this point the main advantage

of the procedure producing the symplectic map in [4] is that it can be immediately

quantised.
