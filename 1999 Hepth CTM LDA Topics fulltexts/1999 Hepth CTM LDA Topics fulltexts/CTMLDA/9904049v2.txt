abstract. we show that the reeh-schlieder property w.r.t. kms states is a direct consequence of locality,
additivity and the relativistic kms condition. the latter characterizes the thermal equilibrium states of a

relativistic quantum eld theory. the statement remains valid even if the given equilibrium state breaks spatial

translation invariance.

i. introduction

in a relativistic quantum theory (even of massive particles), the vacuum state, which is
simply characterized by poincare invariance and the spectrum condition, has a very rich
intrinsic structure. the full content of the theory can be described in terms of vacuum
expectation values. and there are more surprises out there. while studying a relativistic
quantum theory and its vacuum state, one encounters a number of most peculiar prop-
erties, which require a drastic departure from classical quantum mechanics and its in-
terpretation. the famous reeh-schlieder property may be seen as one of the origins of
these peculiarities; with astonishing consequences for the theory and its interpretation.
it somehow exploits the correlations between the vacuum expectation values of measure-
ments in spacelike separated regions. according to the celebrated cluster theorem these
correlations decay exponentially (as long as the theory describes only massive particles).
therefore the energy necessary to exploit them puts severe limits on the size of aortable
eects. nevertheless, the reeh-schlieder theorem states that if there where no restrictions
on the available energy, then one could prepare any vector state with arbitrary accuracy
using only strictly local operations; i.e., operations performed in an arbitray bounded
spacetime region. (in the mathematical description, the vacuum state is specied by a
vector  in the so-called vacuum hilbert space h and a local operation is modelled by a
linear operator acing on h.)

the reeh-schlieder property for thermal equilibrium states was rst proven by jung-
las.1 he assumed that the thermal equilibrium state is locally normal w.r.t. the vacuum and
his proof relied on a result of borchers concerning timelike cylinders in the vacuum repre-
sentation. only time translations were used and therefore the (standard) kms condition,
which characterizes equilibrium states, was sucient. here we present a self-contained
derivation of the reeh-schlieder property, which does not rely on results concerning the
vacuum sector, but instead takes advantage of the relativistic kms condition, recently
proposed by bros and buchholz.2 we will introduce it in the next section. we would like
to emphasize that we do not require that there exists a group of unitary operators which
implements spacelike translations in the thermal representation associated with a given

2

equilibrium state. in fact, our proof remains applicable even if the thermal state breaks
translation or rotation symmetry. it uses glasers theorem and exploits the characteristic
analyticity properties of an equilibrium state. the latter simply reect the basic stability
and passivity properties of an equilibrium state.

remark. recently the cluster theorem has been generalized to thermal states.3 by simply
combining the kms condition with the locality assumption the author was able to show
that there is a tight relation between the infrared properties of the generator of time
translations and the decay of spatial correlations in any extremal kms state, in complete
analogy to the well understood case of the vacuum state. to be more precise, since the
spectrum of the generator of the time-evolution in the thermal sector does not have a mass
gap, a new condition proposed by buchholz, which may be interpreted as a type of holder
continuity of the spectrum at the discrete eigenvalue zero, has been used to show that
the correlations between two spacelike separated measurements decay like some inverse
power of their spatial distance. the correlations of free massless bosons in two dimensions
saturate these bounds.

to conclude this introduction we line out the content of this paper.

in section 2
basic properties of thermal quantum eld theories and their representations are collected,
including the relativistic kms condition of bros and buchholz. section 3 contains the
derivation of the reeh-schlieder property for thermal equilibrium states. a brief outlook
is given in the nal section.

ii. thermal quantum field theory

in the algebraic formulation4 a qft is casted into an inclusion preserving map

o  a(o)

(1)

which assigns to any open bounded region o in minkowski space ir4 a unital c -al-
gebra a(o). the hermitian elements of the abstract c -algebra a(o) are interpreted as
the observables which can be measured at times and locations in o. the net o  a(o)
is isotonous, i.e., there exists a unital embedding

a(o1)  a(o2)

if o1  o2.

(2)

for mathematical convenience the local algebras are embedded in the c -inductive limit
algebra

a = oir4a(o)

the spacetime symmetry of minkowski space manifests itself in the existence of a repre-
sentation

here o denotes the spacelike complement of o and ac(o) denotes the set of operators
in a which commute with all operators in a(o).

remark. let h  l1(ir4, d4x) such that the fourier-transform h of h has compact support.
strong continuity of the group of automorphisms x 7 x implies that the bochner integral

ah = z d4x h(x)x(a),

a  a,

(7)

exists in a and denes an entire analytic element for the translations. (if the map x 7
x fails to be strongly continuous, then we may proceed by simply restricting the given
net o  a(o) to the subnet consisting of those elements of a which comply with the
continuity condition (see, e.g., ref. 5, proposition 1.18).) recall that b  a is called an
entire analytic element for the group of automorphisms x 7 x, if there exists a function
g: ic4  a such that

i)

ii)

g(x) = x(b) for all x  ir4 ;
z 7 (cid:0)g(z)(cid:1) is entire analytic for all positive linear funtionals  over a.

the algebra a of entire analytic elements is norm dense in a.

states are, by denition, positive, linear and normalized functionals over a. it is an
advantage of the abstract setting that the thermal equilibrium states can be distinguished
among the set of all (physical) states by rst principles such as time invariance, stability
against small perturbations or passivity properties (see ref. 6 and 7). adding a few
technical assumptions one usually ends up (see ref. 8 and 9) with a precise mathematical
selection criterion: the kms condition. today the kms condition is generally accepted as
the appropriate mathematical criterion for equilibrium. but only recently, buchholz and
junglas have shown that the characterization of equilibrium states by the kms condition
applies even to a large class of relativistic models.10

lorentz invariance is always broken by a kms state.11,12 a kms state might also
break spatial translation or rotation invariance, but the maximal propagation velocity of
signals, which is characteristic for a relativistic theory, will not be aected by such a lack of
symmetry. it was rst recognized by bros and buchholz that a nite maximal propagation
velocity of signals basically implies that the kms states of a relativistic qft have stronger
analyticity properties in conguration space than those imposed by the traditional kms
condition.2 these properties are summarized in the following

the relativistic kms condition can be understood as a remnant of the relativistic
spectrum condition in the vacuum sector. it has been rigorously established2 for the kms
states constructed by buchholz and junglas.10 in this letter we will show that together
with the condition of additivity (see (13) below) it implies that the kms state has the
reeh-schlieder property.

once a relativistic kms state  for some inverse temperatur  is xed, the well
known gns-construction provides a hilbert space h, a cyclic vector   h and a
thermal representation  of a such that

(a) = (cid:0) , (a)(cid:1)

(10)
due to the kms condition the vector  is not only cyclic for r := (a) but also
separating. (note that a priori the relativistic kms condition only applies to elements of
a and in general it will not extend to r.) thus any state, which is normal w.r.t. , is
a vector state (see ref. 9, 2.5.31).

a  a.

remark. our main concern may be formulated as follows: given a state : a  ic, can
we nd an element a in a(o) (representing a strictly local operation in o) such that
k  k < , where  is identied with the normal state induced by  := (a)?
obviously, it is sucent to prove that  can be chosen arbitrarily close to  in the
hilbert space topology, where  is the state vector associated with the state . this will
be a direct consequence of theorem iii.9.

the representation  assigns to any o  ir4 a von neumann algebra

the weak closure respects the local structure, i.e.,

r(o) = (cid:0)a(o)(cid:1)

.

(11)

r(o1)  r(o2)

(12)
note that r(o) denotes the commutant of r(o) in the algebra b(h) of all bounded
operators on h. we emphasize that r(o) includes both the algebra r
, which itself
is isomorphic to r, and r(o) as subalgebras.

denition ii.2. the net o  r(o) is called additive, if

ii oi = o  ii r(oi) = r(o).

(13)

here i is some index set and ir(oi) denotes the von neumann algebra generated by
the algebras r(oi), i  i.

if  is locally normal w.r.t. the vacuum representation, then additivity in the vacuum
sector and additivity in the thermal sector are equivalent. as is well known, additivity
in the vacuum sector can be proven, if the net of local algebras is constructed from a
wightman eld theory.

the reeh-schlieder property

we start with the following adapted and simplied version of glasers theorem 1 (see ref.
13, see also ref. 14, 15):

theorem iii.1. (glaser): let a  a and let fa,a denote the function introduced in (9).
the following properties are equivalent:

i.) there exists an open neighborhood v of 0 in ir4 and a point z1  te/2 such
that z1 + v  te/2 and such that for each complex-valued testfunction f with
support in v

zir4ir4

d4y1d4y2 fa,a(y1 + z1, y2 + z1)f (y1)f (y2)  0.

(14)

ii.) there exists a sequence (cid:8)f (n)

such that for (z1, z2)  t  t

a : te/2  ic(cid:9)nin of functions holomorphic in te/2

fa,a(z1, z2) = xnin

f (n)
a (z1)f (n)

a (z2)

(15)

holds in the sense of uniform convergence on every compact subset of te/2 
te/2.

the next step is to show that condition i.) is indeed satised, if  is a relativistic

kms state:

6

christian d. j akel

proposition iii.2. let  be a state which satises the relativistic kms condition at
inverse temperature  > 0 and let v be an open neighborhood of 0 in ir4.

it follows that for each complex-valued test function f with support in v

(16)

for all 0 <  < /2. here e denotes the unit vector in the time direction distinguished by
the relativistic kms condition.

f := zv

now dene, for y1, y2  ir4 and 0 <  < /2,

assumes its maximum value on the boundary of its domain and for  = 0, /2, the boundary
values, the relativistic kms condition yields

nk  kak and kk = 1. strong continuity

u := {(y1  ie, y2 + ie) : y1, y2  ir4, 0 <  < /2}.

(23)

the limit function f is therefore continuous and bounded on u and analytic in u. more-
over,

f(y1, y2) = fa,a(y1, y2)

for

y1, y2  ir4.

(24)

thus, due to their analyticity properties, the functions f and fa,a must coincide on u.
it follows that

(25)



the crucial step in the proof of the reeh-schlieder property is now summarized in the

following

proposition iii.3. for each a  a the vector valued function a: ir4  h,

can be analytically continued from the real axis into the domain te/2 such that it is weakly
continuous for z  0.

x 7 (cid:0)x(a)(cid:1)

(26)

proof. let a, b  a with kak = 1. because of

(a) = h

(27)

the set of vectors s := {(b) : b  a} is dense in h. moreover, according to theorem

iii.1.ii) there exists a sequence (cid:8)f (n)
which satises (15). this allows us to consider  for z  te/2 and a  a xed  the
map a,z: s  ic

(b) 7 xnin

f (n)

(28)

(recall that  is separating for (a). hence the map b 7 (b) is injective and
consequently the map (b) 7 f (n)

(0) is well-dened.) using kak  1,

b

(30)

by the hahn-banach theorem the map a,z: s  ic extends to a (bounded) continuous
linear functional a,z on h. the riesz lemma ensures that there exists a vector a(z) 
h such that

the map

a,z() = (cid:0)a(z) , (cid:1)

  h.

z 7 a(z)

(31)

(32)

is analytic for z  te/2. (this can be shown by an approximation argument similar to
the one given in the proof of proposition iii.2.) as can be seen more easily, the map (32)
is also weakly continuous at the boundary set z = 0, where it satises

a(x) = (cid:0)x(a)(cid:1)

x  ir4.

(33)



although we will not directly use it, we believe that it is worthwhile to spell out the

following

corollary iii.4. let a, b  a and let a, b denote the associated vector valued functions
introduced in (32). it follows that

for all z1, z2  te/2. here fa,b denotes the analytic function introduced in (9).

fa,b(z1, z2) = (cid:0)a(z1) , b(z2)(cid:1)

proof. the l.h.s. as well as the r.h.s. denes a holomorphic function on

te/2  te/2  ic4  ic4.

moreover, for z1  0 and z2  0 we nd

(cid:0)a(x1) , b(x2)(cid:1) = (cid:0)(x1(a)) , (x2(b))(cid:1)

= (cid:0)x1 (a)x2(b)(cid:1) = fa,b(x1, x2)

(34)

(35)

(36)

for all x1, x2  ir4. applying the edge-of-the-wedge theorem we conclude that the l.h.s.

and the r.h.s. in (34) describe the same analytic function.

the reeh-schlieder property for thermal field theories

what remains to be proven in order to establish the reeh-schlieder property is fairly
standard. borchers and buchholz16 recently gave a nice and transparent formulation of
this nal part of the argument and therefore we will simply reproduce their formulation
here, up to minor notational dierences.

denition iii.5. let o be any open region. the -algebra b(o) is dened as the set of
operators b  a(o) for which there exists some neighborhood n  ir4 of the origin such
that

x(b)  a(o)

x  n ,

where the neighborhood n may depend on b.

b(o) is a -algebra and

a(o)  b(o)

for any region o whose closure lies in the interior of o.

lemma iii.6. let   h be a vector with the property that

it follows that for each b  b(o) the function

(cid:0) , (b)(cid:1) = 0

b  b(o).

vanishes.

ir4  x 7 (cid:0) , (cid:0)x(b)(cid:1)(cid:1)

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

proof. let b  b(o) and let n as in (37). it follows from the denition of b(o) and the
geometrical action (5) of the translations that there exists some  > 0, which may depend
on b, such that

on the other hand the function

x(b)  b(o)

for

|x| < .

ir4  x 7 (cid:0)x(b)(cid:1)

(41)

(42)

extends analytically to some vector-valued function in the domain te/2 by proposi-
tion iii.3. combining (42) with (41) and (39) we nd that

for all x  ir4.

(cid:0) , (cid:0)x(b)(cid:1)(cid:1) = 0

(43)



10

christian d. j akel

lemma iii.7. assume that the additivity assumption (13) holds. it follows that

xir4 (cid:16)x(cid:0)b(o)(cid:1)(cid:17)

= r.

(44)

once again, xir4 (cid:0)x(b(o))(cid:1)
algebras (cid:0)x(b(o)(cid:1)

, x  ir4.

denotes the von neumann algebra generated by the

proof. let o be an open subset of o such that its closure o is contained in the interior
of o. it follows that

xir4 (cid:16)x(cid:0)b(o)(cid:1)(cid:17)

 xir4 (cid:16)x(cid:0)a(o)(cid:1)(cid:17)

.

combining (5) with (13) we conclude that the r.h.s. equals r.

corollary iii.8. let   h be a vector with the property that

it follows that  = 0.

(cid:0) , (b)(cid:1) = 0

b  b(o).

proof. first, we apply lemma iii.6 and conclude from (40) that

 xir4 (cid:0)x(cid:0)b(o)(cid:1)(cid:1).

(45)



(46)

(47)

then we recall that the orthogonal complement of (cid:0)x(cid:0)b(o)(cid:1)(cid:1) is closed, therefore
it coincides with the orthogonal complement of (cid:0)x(cid:0)b(o)(cid:1)(cid:1)

. hence lemma iii.7

implies

by construction r = h, thus  = 0.

r.

(48)



we will now show that for every vector   h there exists an operator in (cid:0)a(o)(cid:1),

which, when applied to , generates a vector which is arbitrarily close to :

theorem iii.9. consider a qft as specied in section 2 and let  be a state, which
satises the relativistic kms condition. if the additivity assumption (13) holds, then

for any open spacetime region o  ir4. moreover, if the spacelike complement of o is
not empty, then  is separating for r(o).

h = (cid:0)a(o)(cid:1),

(49)

the reeh-schlieder property for thermal field theories

11

proof. we have to show that the orthogonal complement of (cid:0)a(o)(cid:1) vanishes. assume

that

obviously, this implies

(cid:0)a(o)(cid:1).
(cid:0)b(o)(cid:1)

(50)

(51)

and then corollary iii.8 yields  = 0. on the other hand, if the spacelike complement o

of o is not empty, then  is cyclic for r(o)  (cid:0)a(o)(cid:1). since r(o)  r(o),
this implies that  is cyclic for r(o) and therefore separating for r(o).



similar to the situation where  = , in the so-called vacuum sector,  shares the

reeh-schlieder property with a large class of vectors in h.

theorem iii.10. there exists a dense set d  h, such that for all   d

where o  ir4 is again an arbitrary open spacetime region.

h = (cid:0)a(o)(cid:1),

(52)

proof. a set d  r of suitable entire analytic vectors in h may be specied by
putting

d = n(cid:16) l1 

(a)

2 kak(cid:17) : a  ao.

note that d is dense in h:

d = (a) = (a) = h.

the essential step is to show that for arbitrary b  a the function

ir4  x 7 (cid:0)x(b)(cid:1)

(53)

(54)

(55)

extends to some analytic vector-valued function in the domain te/2. the reader is invited
to check that theorem iii.1 and proposition iii.2 can easily be adapted and that the
proofs given remain valid if we replace  by some vector   d. finally, we note that

(cid:0) l1  a/2 kak(cid:1) is invertible in a, thus
(a)(cid:16) l1 

(a)

2 kak(cid:17) = (a).

(56)

we conclude that (a) = h, which ensures that the arguments given in the proof of

corollary iii.8 apply also in this slightly more general case.

outlook

christian d. j akel

although both quantum statistical mechanics as well as quantum eld theory can nicely
be formulated in terms of operator algebras, little of course, one should not forget to
mention the beautiful progress that has recently is known about the thermal states of
a relativistic system. been achieved in the wightman approach to thermal eld theory
(see, e.g., ref. 17). in fact, only recently the relativistic kms condition, which provides
the necessary substitute for the spectrum condition, was formulated. as we have demon-
strated, it allows us to treat the thermal theory independently from the vacuum theory.
in a series of forthcoming papers by the author basic results like the cluster theorem, the
schlieder property and the borchers property have been derived. the nuclearity condi-
tion, which distinguishes theories with decent phase-space properties, was used to derive
the split property, which expresses a strong form of statistical independence of spacelike
separated measurements. a rather involved argument, based on a rigorous version of what
is commonly called doubling the degrees of freedom in thermal eld theory, establishes the
convergence of local charges in the thermal sector. these results use the reeh-schlieder
property as a crucial input; and without the present result one would have to recourse
to the physically sound but unproven assumption that relativistic kms states are locally
normal w.r.t. the vacuum representation.

many other bricks are still missing in the wall, for instance a thermal jost-lehmann-
dyson representation. scattering theory in the thermal context is one of the major chal-
lenges; in fact, the author would like to emphasize that the severe problems encountered in
perturbation theory open up a fair chance for the operator algebraic approach to attract
some interest from outside, provided it can oer some progress on this topic in time.
