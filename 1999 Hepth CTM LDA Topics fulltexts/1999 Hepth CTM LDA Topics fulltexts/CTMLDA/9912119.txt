j +(i1) also m, j +(i1) 6= . note j (i0) j +(i1) may coincide case maximally extended schwarzchild schwarzchild-anti-de sitter spacetimes. simple terms, results show black hole spacetimes formed collapse topological structures must always black hole white hole horizons. behavior quantitatively dierent spacetimes containing black holes formed collapse matter may, need exhibit white hole horizon. therefore, white holes essential feature black hole spacetimes formed collapse topology. implications corollary ads/cft correspondence immediate. asymptotically de-sitter spacetime satisfying reasonable physical conditions, component boundary-at-innity cannot causally communicate disjoint component boundary-at-innity. thus eld operator one component boundary-at- innity cannot causally interact another eld operator disjoint component. thus eld operator one component commute eld operator disjoint component i. thus conformal eld theories dened disjoint components boundary-at-innity interact dynamically. clearly however, one set correlations initial vacuum states conformal eld theories. fact, necessary appearance white hole horizons may yield natural way so. however, correlations dynamic. 11 iv. topology regions exterior black hole horizons n + 1 dimensions one obtain information regions exterior black hole horizons one considers topology intersections certain spacelike hypersurfaces hori- zons;

(4.2) since h0(v, 0) torsion free injective, h1(v, v ) torsion free. next, poincare- lefschetz duality gives h n1(v ) = h1(v, v ). hence h n1(v ) torsion free. universal coecient theorem implies h n1(v ) = hom (hn1(v ), z) ext (hn2(v ), z) . (4.3) functor ext(, ) bilinear rst argument respect direct sums ext(zk, z) = zk. hence h n1(v ) cannot torsion free unless hn2(v ) is. completes proof lemma. boundary surfaces 1, 2, . . ., k clearly determine k linearly independent (n 1)- cycles v , hence bn1 k. remains show bn1 k. since hn1(v ) h n1(v ) nitely generated torsion free, hn1(v ) = h n1(v ) = h1(v, v ), 15 made use poincare-lefschetz duality. hence, bn1 = rank h1(v, v ). show rank h1(v, v ) k, refer long exact sequence (4.2). excision, h0(v, 0) = h0(v \ 0, ) = h0(v \ 0). hence, injectivity , rank h1(v, v ) rank h0(v, 0) = number components v \ 0 = k. completes proof theorem 5. easy consequence theorem 5 b1(0) b1(v ). observed earlier, addition wormhole changes 1(v ) also hn1(v ). also note rank hn1(v ;

one construct surfaces characterize cuts black hole horizons occur via collapse quite general asymptotically spacetimes. one construct globally hyperbolic spacetime consists subset original spacetime. one carry similar construction 16 asymptotically anti-de sitter spacetimes. precisely, let k cut i, let ik portion future k, ik = +(k). let dk domain outer communications respect ik, dk = +(ik) (ik) = +(k) (i). one chooses k = dk globally hyperbolic closure cauchy surface good intersection black hole horizons, i.e. intersections (n 1)-manifolds. new spacetime satises conditions theorem 1 contain surface v required theorem 4. therefore conclusions theorem 5 hold surfaces well. thus, though topological censorship determine topology arbitrary embedded hypersurfaces, hypersurfaces homeomorphic cauchy surfaces domain outer communications make good cuts horizons. details regarding procedure discussed . v. results 2 + 1 4 + 1 dimensions clearly, using special properties manifolds given dimension n, results obtained may strengthened. particularly true low dimension. special relevance ads/cft correspondence conjecture results asymptotically anti-de sitter spacetimes 2 + 1 4 + 1 dimensions. three dimensions one show theorem 6. assume globally hyperbolic spacetime-with-boundary satises conditions theorem 4. 2-dimensional hypersurface v either b2 s1. proof: 1-manifolds orientable, v orientable. theorem 5 implies rank free part h1(v ;
