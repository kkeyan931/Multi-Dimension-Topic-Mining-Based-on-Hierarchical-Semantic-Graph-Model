abstract

we study the non-perturbative, instanton-corrected eective action of the
n = 2 su(2)  su(2) supersymmetric yangmills theory with a mass-
less hypermultiplet in the bifundamental representation. starting from the
appropriate hyperelliptic curve, we determine the periods and the exact
holomorphic prepotential in a certain weak coupling expansion. we discuss
the dependence of the solution on the parameter q = 2
2 and several other

interesting properties.

1 introduction

many eld theoretical results have been obtained by considering brane con-
gurations in string theory and m-theory. in particular m-theory ve-branes
provide a very fruitful approach to n = 2 [1, 2] and n = 1 [3, 4, 5]
supersymmetric eld theories.
in this note we study the case of product
gauge group su(2)  su(2) with a hypermultiplet in the bifundamental
representation. seibergwitten curves of theories with product gauge groups
have been obtained from the m-theory [2] and the geometric engineering
approach [6]. the precise relation between the moduli of the curve and the
moduli of the eld theory has been described in [7].

yet another account of supersymmetric eld theories with product gauge

groups of the form g = qi su(ni) has been obtained in the framework

of calogeromoser systems, using certain limits of su(n) supersymmetric
yangmills theory with matter in the adjoint representation [8].
in this
approach the dynamical scales of the dierent gauge group factors are all
equal to the scale of the underlying su(n) group. one-instanton predictions
for the prepotential of n = 2 supersymmetric eld theories with gauge group
su(n1)  su(n2) and massless matter in the bifundamental representation
have been made by using a perturbation expansion of the non-hyperelliptic
curve around its hyperelliptic approximation [9].

in the present paper we study the instanton expansion for the case of a mass-
less hypermultiplet in the bifundamental representation of su(2)  su(2).
specically we will compute the periods as solutions of the picardfuchs
equations and obtain in this way the holomorphic prepotential f that governs
the low-energy eective action of the theory. the solution reproduces the
existing results in the appropriate limits and has interesting properties in
the general region of moduli space.

2 the setup

by considering the appropriate brane conguration in m-theory [2] one nds
that the dening polynomial for the seibergwitten curve of n = 2 super-
i su(ki) is

symmetric yangmills theory with a gauge group of the form qn

1

given by

p (x, t) = tn+1 + pk1(x) tn + pk2(x) tn1 +    + pkn(x) t + c = 0 .

(2.1)

the pki(x) are polynomials of order ki in x, and c is a constant that depends
on the dynamical scales i of the dierent gauge group factors.
in this
expression the variables x and t correspond to the combinations x4 + ix5 and
e(x6+ix10)/r in the notation of [2].
for the case of su(2)  su(2) with a massless hypermultiplet in the bifun-
damental representation, the explicit expressions for the polynomials pki(x)
in (2.1) have been derived by using symmetries and classical limits [7]. the
curve for the massive case is given by

p (x, t) = 1

2t3 + t2(cid:20)x2  u +

2

1

2 (cid:21) + t(cid:20)(x + m)2  v +

2

2

2 (cid:21) + 2

2 = 0.

(2.2)
here u and v are the moduli of the two gauge group factors, i are the
corresponding dynamical scales, and m is the bare mass of the hypermultiplet.
note that the dimensionless parameter q = 2
2 cannot be eliminated from
1
the curve by rescaling of the moduli, unless q = 1.

figure 1: the brane conguration that gives rise to a four-dimensional
eld theory with gauge group su(2)  su(2) and a hypermultiplet in the
bifundamental representation. vertical lines represent ve-branes, horizontal
lines are four-branes.

exchanging the two gauge group factors, i.e. u  v, 1  2, t  1
t , and
x  (x + m), leaves the curve (2.2) invariant. pulling the rightmost ve-
brane to x6 =  gives the brane conguration of a theory with gauge group
su(2) and two fundamental avours with masses m1 and m2. to make this
transformation manifest in the curve one has to perform the limit 2  0,
v  1
2(m1 + m2). the theory with pure gauge group

su(2) can be obtained by moving the two four-branes of one gauge group
factor to x = , so that the resulting conguration consists only of two four-
branes stretched between two ve-branes. to obtain the curve of this theory
2(m2  v) = 4
we have to take the limit v  , m   while keeping 1
0
xed.

in the case of gauge group su(2)  su(2) the polynomials p1(x) and p2(x)
are quadratic in x; we can therefore rewrite (2.2) in hyperelliptic form by

as expected, 1 and 2 are symmetric under the exchange of the two gauge
group factors.
in general the vanishing of discriminant factors describes
points in moduli space where extra massless states appear. following the
analysis of [7], the vanishing of 1 determines the subspace of the moduli
space where the coulomb branch meets the higgs branch and the gauge group
su(2)  su(2) is broken to the diagonal su(2). therefore the extra massless
states that occur at this point are two components of the bifundamental
hypermultiplet. the vanishing of the second discriminant factor describes the
singular locus where other massless states appear, in particular monopoles.

the classical intersection point of the coulomb branch and the higgs branch
at u = v gets shifted by non-perturbative eects if the two scales do not
have equal values, i.e. if q 6= 1. this dependence is inferred by the terms i
2
in the curve (2.2) and could formally be avoided by choosing the dening
polynomial to be

2

p (x, t) = 1

2 t3 + t2(cid:0)x2  u + 1

2(cid:1) + t(cid:0)x2  v + 2

2(cid:1) + 2

1in the following we set the bare mass m of the hypermultiplet to zero.

2 = 0.

(2.6)

then the two scales no longer explicitly appear in 1. in order to reduce (2.6)
to the curve for su(2) with two avours we then have to perform a shift in the
modulus u in addition to the above-stated transformation: u  u = u+ 7 1
.
8
this means that the origins of the two moduli spaces would simply be shifted
by 7 1
8

, though classically the moduli still coincide.

the polynomial (2.3) describes a riemann surface  of genus 2. if we choose
a symplectic homology basis of , i.e. i and i (i = 1, 2) with intersection
pairing i  j = ij, i  j = i  j = 0, we can dene the period integrals
in terms of a properly chosen meromorphic one-form :

ai = zi

,

adi = zi

.

(2.7)

the periods are functions of the moduli u and v, ai(u, v) is identied with
the scalar component of the n = 1 chiral multiplet in the i-th gauge group
factor, adi(u, v) is its dual. once the periods ai and adi are known, the
exact quantum-corrected prepotential f (ak) of the theory can be computed
by integrating the relations

adi(ak) =

f (ak)

ai

.

(2.8)

the second-order derivatives of f with respect to ai imply the integrability
condition

adi(ak)

adj(ak)

=

aj

ai

.

(2.9)

the meromorphic one-form  of the curve (2.2) is given by [1]

 

x dt

,

(2.10)

or, after the redenition x  i y

2 t (1+t)

,

(2.11)

where the proportionality factor is determined by the requirements


v

=

y

and

4


u

=

y

.

(2.12)

it is rather tedious to perform the integrals (2.7) explicitly. however, the
periods as functions of the moduli u and v satisfy a system of partial dif-
ferential equations, the so-called picardfuchs equations. this method to
obtain the periods is relatively straightforward and will be the subject of the
next sections.

3 the picardfuchs equations

starting with the hyperelliptic form (2.3) of the curve2 for su(2)  su(2),


we will derive the system of partial dierential equations for the periods ri
and ri

.

y , x dx

y , x2 dx

on a riemann surface  of genus 2 there are two holomorphic dierentials
and two meromorphic dierentials with no residues (abelian dierentials of
, x3 dx
rst and second kind) [10]. therefore we can choose { dx
y }
as basis of meromorphic forms on . when considering derivatives of the
meromorphic one-form  with respect to the moduli, only four of them will
be linearly independent up to exact forms. the linear relations between these
derivatives dene the picardfuchs equations.
derivatives of  with respect to u and v involve terms of the form (x) dx
with some polynomials (x). in order to express (x) dx
in terms of abelian
dierentials of rst and second kind, we need a method to reduce high powers
of x in the numerator and high powers of y in the denominator. for the latter
we use the fact that the discriminant of a polynomial p(x) of order n can
always be written in the form [11]

y

yn

yn

 = a(x) p(x) + b(x) p(x),

(3.1)

where a(x), resp. b(x), is a polynomial of order (n  2), resp. (n  1), in x.
with this formula it can easily be shown that the following relation holds up
to exact forms:

(x)
yn =

1


a(x) (x) + 2
n2
yn2

d
dx (b(x) (x))

.

(3.2)

2for convenience we replace t by x in the following.

following [11] we derive a formula to reduce high powers of x that is valid
up to addition of total derivatives:

when we consider derivatives of  with respect to u and v up to second order,
we nd that these derivatives satisfy two linear relations as only four out of
six are linearly independent. these two relations give rise to the following
picardfuchs operators:

note that the rst (second) operator is antisymmetric (symmetric) under the
exchange of the two gauge group factors.

4 the periods and the prepotential

we are interested in the prepotential of su(2)  su(2) supersymmetric
yangmills theory in the weak coupling regime, which is parametrized by
large values of the moduli u and v. as usual, if we have two variables that

6

simultaneously become large, we have to specify an appropriate coordinate
patch in which the limit is well-dened. by inspection of the rst discriminant
factor (2.4), we choose the variables to be

z1 =

2

1
u

and z2 =

u  v + 1

2(1
2
1

2  2

2)

.

(4.1)

this choice is not symmetric under the exchange of the two gauge group
factors, but of course there exists the analogous patch in the moduli space
where the role of the two moduli is interchanged. using frobenius method,

we nd two series solutions and two logarithmic solutions with indices(cid:0) 1
and (cid:0) 1

2 , 0(cid:1)
2 , 1(cid:1) in the coordinate patch of the moduli space parametrized by (4.1):

the rst few coecients of these series expansions are listed in the appendix.

in order to get the periods we have to consider linear combinations of the
solutions that match the infrared asymptotic behaviour. to analyse these
leading terms one can either evaluate the lowest order of the integrals (2.7)
explicitly or one uses semi-classical relations of the gauge couplings and the
integrability condition (2.9).

the gauge couplings ij of the theory are related to the prepotential f by

ij =

2f (ak)
aiaj

=

adi
aj

.

(4.6)

the one-loop terms of the pure couplings ii consist of the logarithmic con-
tributions of the massless spectrum. in each gauge group factor there is a
gauge eld in the adjoint representation; moreover there is a hypermultiplet

7

in the bifundamental representation. therefore the one-loop contributions of
the pure gauge couplings are given by

11  4 ln (a1) + ln (a1
22  4 ln (a2) + ln (a1

2  a2
2  a2

2),
2).

(4.7)

in order to examine the asymptotic behaviour of the periods, we integrate

the gauge couplings ii in (4.7) to obtain adi(ak) = r ii(ak) dai, introduce

a new variable  = a1  a2, and expand around the point (a1, ) = (, 0).
this procedure gives the leading terms of the periods adi:

ad1  2 a1 ln(a1)   ln(a1) +  ln() + . . . ,
ad2  2 a1 ln(a1) + 3  ln(a1)   ln() + . . . .

(4.8)

to compare the solutions (4.4) and (4.5) with these expansions, we have to
2
replace the moduli u and v by the corresponding classical expressions u = a1
2. we apply the same procedure as above to a linear combination
and v = a2
of the logarithmic solutions a w3 + b w4 and nd, in leading order:

 2 a a1 ln(a1) + (a  8 b)  ln(a1) + 4 b  ln() + . . . .

(4.9)

hence the periods adi are reproduced by the following linear combinations
of the solutions

where the coecients a1, a2, b1, b2 are still undetermined. we also nd that

(4.11)

it can easily be checked that in the limits of su(2) nf = 0, resp. nf = 2,
stated in section 2, a1 reduces to the corresponding periods known in the
literature. by imposing the integrability condition (2.9), one nds that
a2 = a1 and b2 = b1.

8

the prepotential can be computed by integrating the equations (2.8). to this
end we have to know the magnetic periods adi as functions of the electric
periods ak. by inverting the series expansions of ak in (4.11) we get the
variables zi and in consequence the magnetic periods as functions of ak:

as expected, all contributions to the prepotential are totally symmetric under
the exchange of the two gauge group factors. the constants a1 and b1 are
determined by the classical coupling constants. the one-loop contribution
f1loop is in agreement with the corresponding term of the prepotential
reported in [8] and [9].
up to an overall scaling factor of the two scales, f1inst coincides with the
one-instanton term in the prepotential of [9].
if the bare mass m of the
hypermultiplet in the prepotential obtained in [8] is set to zero, the one-
instanton term coincides with f1inst for q = 1, but the terms proportional
to q in f2inst are not present. this is a priori no contradiction, since sending
the bare mass to zero is a singular limit.

the instanton terms cannot be written as simple sums of contributions
stemming from the two subgroups, but show a non-trivial mixing of a1 and
a2, as it is expected in the presence of a hypermultiplet in the bifundamental

10

representation. in particular the n-th instanton term is not just a sum of
2 j
contributions proportional to i
with i + j = n appear in fninst. terms proportional to odd powers of the
scales are forbidden as they would violate the anomaly-free discrete symmetry
of the theory [12].

it is quite striking that nearly all terms in the instanton expansion of the

prepotential are proportional to (a1
in either of the two cases two components of the hypermultiplet become
massless and one expects to recover the point in moduli space where the
coulomb branch meets the higgs branch and the gauge group is broken to
the diagonal su(2). continuity of the prepotential at the intersection point
ensures that f collapses to the prepotential of pure su(2). indeed, if one sets
a1 =  a2 = a in the prepotential (4.14), the non-vanishing terms reproduce
the prepotential of su(2) theory with the dynamical scale 2 = 4 12 to
all calculated orders.

in [7] a dierent argumentation, namely considerations of the brane congu-
ration and the curve, led to the insight that the same point in moduli space

astounding that this condition is equivalent to a1
these two relations describe the same physical scenario.
