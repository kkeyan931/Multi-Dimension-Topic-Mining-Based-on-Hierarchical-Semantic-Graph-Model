abstract. we give explicit and inductive formulas for the construction of a lorentz
covariant renormalization in the eg approach. this automatically provides for a co-
variant bphz subtraction at totally spacelike momentum useful for massless theories.

introduction

our introduction is rather brief since this paper mainly is a continuation of [bpp99].
there we a gave a formula for a lorentz invariant renormalization in one coordinate.
we use the same methods to construct a covariant solution for more variables.

we review the eg subtraction and give some useful formulas in section 1. the
cohomological analysis that leads to a group covariant solution is reviewed in section 2.
in sections 3, 4 we give an inductive construction for these solutions in the case of
tensorial and spinorial lorentz covariance. since the symmmetry of the one variable
problem is absent in general some permutation group calculus will enter. necessary
material is in the appendix. in the last section 5 we give a covariant bphz subtraction
for arbitrary (totally spacelike) momentum by fourier transformation.

1. the eg subtraction

we review the extension procedure in the eg approach [eg73]. a more general
introduction can be found in [pra99], a generalization to manifolds in [bf96, bf99].
let d

the equation for a follows from the leibnitz rule in (8), while the equation for c is
derived from (9).

in quantum eld theory the coefcients a are called counter terms. they are not
arbitrary. they have to be chosen in such a way that lorentz covariance of 0t is pre-
served in the extension. this follows in the next sections. the remaining freedom
is further restricted by discrete symmetries like permutation symmetry or c, p and t
symmetries. at the end gauge invariance or renormalization constraints will x the
extension uniquely. but up to now there is no local prescription of the latter.

2. the g-covariant extension

we will rst dene the notion of a g-covariant distribution. so let g be a linear

transformation group on rd i.e. x 7 gx, g  g. then
= (gx)

b x

x

7 g

(11)

denotes the corresponding tensor representation. g acts on functions in the following
way:

(gj )(x)

.
= j (g1x),

so that d is made a g-module. we further have

g(j

) = (gj )(gy ),
g1(

a (g1j ) = (gx)
x
a (g1j )(0) = (gx)

x

j ),

j (0).

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

now assume we have a distribution 0t  d (rd\{0}) that transforms covariantly under
the group g as a density, i.e.

0t(gx)| detg| = d(g)0t(x),
where d is the corresponding representation. that means:

(cid:10)0t, gy (cid:11) =(cid:10)d(g)0t,y (cid:11) .

= d(g)(cid:10)0t,y (cid:11) .

then (23) denes a map from g to a nite dimensional complex vectorspace. now we
follow [sp82], [sch95][chapter 4.5]: applying two transformations

|w)(cid:11)

(i g2)(vw |a

|w)(cid:11) ,

and omitting the indices we see b(g1g2) = b(g1) + d(g1)g1b(g2), which is a 1-cocycle
for b(g). its trivial solutions are the 1-coboundaries
b(g) = (i d(g)g)a,

and these are the only ones if the rst cohomology group of g is zero. in that case we
can restore g-covariance by adding the following counter terms:

(29)

the rst cohomology group of l + vanishes [sch95][chapter 4.5 and references
there]. we determine a from the last equation. the most simple solution appears
in the case of lorentz invarinance in one coordinate. this situation was completely
analyzed in [bpp99] for 
. the following two subsections generalize the
results to arbitrary w, w(0) 6= 0.

[bpp99] which is modied through the generalization for the choice of w:

3.3. general lorentz covariance. if the distribution 0t depends on more than one
variable, 0txa will not be symmetric in all lorentz indices in general. since xa
trans-
forms like a tensor, it is natural to generalize the discussion to the case, where 0t
transforms like a tensor, too. assume rank(0t) = r, then d(g)g is the tensor represen-
tation of rank p = r + n, n = |a
|, in (29). from now on we will omit the indices. so if
t  d (r4m\{0}), we denote byex  formerly xa  a tensor of rank n built of x1, . . . , xm.
to solve (29) we proceed like in [bpp99]. since the equation holds for all g we will
solve for a by using lorentz transformations in the innitesimal neighbourhood of i.
if we take q

] as six coordinates these transformations read:

b = q

,b being lorentz four-indices. in [bpp99] our ability to solve that equation heavily
relied on the given symmetry, which is in general absent here. nevertheless we can
nd an inductive construction for a, corresponding to equation (29) in [bpp99].

we build one casimir operator on the r.h.s. (the other one is always zero, since we

are in a (1/2, 1/2)p representation).

the case p = 1. just to remind that p is the rank ofext, this occurs if either t is a vector
andex = 1, (n = 0), or t is a scalar andex = x1, . . . , xm. (35) gives:

a = 3ia,

la
b b

(36)

=

l

since the casimir operator is diagonal in the irreducible (1/2, 1/2) representation.

the case p = 2. we get

(la

)b

= (6i + la

(37)

since a is a tensor of rank 2, let us introduce the projector onto the symmetric resp.
antisymmetric part and the trace:
pn

ps  pa = t ,
where t denotes the permutation of the two indices. using (34), we nd

now we insert (40) into (37). the trace part will be set to zero again. acting with
pa and ps on the resulting equation gives us two equations for the antisymmetric and
symmetric part respectively. this yields:

(41)

inductive assumption. now we turn back to equation (29). we note that any contrac-
tion commutes with the (group) action on the rhs. hence, if we contract (35), we nd
on the rhs:

i j(l

 i + + i l

)a =

)(h

i ja),

(l

 i + +bi + +bj + + i l

where i, j denote the positions of the corresponding indices, and the chat means omis-

sion. therefore the rank of (35) is reduced by two and we can proceed inductively.
with the cases p = 1, p = 2 solved, we assume that all possible contractions of a are
known.

induction step. multiplying (35) with the generator and contracting the indices yields:

the transposition t acts on a by permutation of the corresponding indices. for a gen-
eral p  sp the action on a is given by: p a1...p = ap 1(1)...p 1(p). in order to solve
this equation we consider the representation of the symmetric groups. we give a brief

summary of all necessary ingredients in appendix a. so let kt

is in the center of the group algebra a sp. it can be

5. general covariant bphz subtraction

in this section we shrink the distribution space to s  since we are dealing with
fourier transformation. let x, q, p  r4m. bphz subtraction at momentum q cor-
responds to using w = eiq in the eg subtraction [pra99].

massive theories one can put q = 0 and has the usual subtraction at zero momentum
which preserves covariance. but this leads to infrared divergencies in the massless
case. there we can use the results from above to construct a covariant bphz subtrac-
tion for momentum q by adding (cid:229)

6. summary and outlook

the subtraction procedure in eg renormalization makes use of an auxiliary (test)
function and hence breaks lorentz covariance, since no lorentz invariant test function
exists. but this symmetry can be restored by an appropriate choice of counterterms.
we give an explicit formula for their calculation in lowest order and an inductive one
for higher orders. using the close relationship to bphz subtraction this directly trans-
lates into a covariant subtraction at totally spacelike momentum.

we expect our solution to be useful for all calculations for which the central solution
(w = 1, see [sch95]) does not exist, namely all theories that contain loops of only
massless particles.

appendix a. representation of the symmetric groups

everything in this brief appendix should be found in any book about representation
theory of nite groups. we refer to [sim96, boe70, fh91]. the group algebra a sp
consists of elements

a = (cid:229)

gsp

a (g) g,

b = (cid:229)

gsp

b (g) g,

(68)

where a
,b are arbitrary complex numbers. the sum of two elements is naturally given
by the summation in c and the product is dened through the following convolution:

= (cid:229)
ab .
= (cid:229)
.

g (g)

g1,g2

a (g1)b (g2) g1g2 = (cid:229)
a (g1)b (g2) = (cid:229)

g (g) g with
a (g1)b (g11g) = (cid:229)

g

g1g2=g

g1

a (gg21)b (g2).

g2

the group algebra is the direct sum of simple twosided ideals:

a sp = i1  ik,

and k is the number of partitions of p. every ideal i j contains f j equivalent irreducible
representations of sp. i j is generated by an idempotent e j  a sp:
2 = e j.

i j = a spe j

(72)

e j

these idempotents satisfy the following orthogonality and completeness relations:

e jei = d

ji

k(cid:229)

j=1

e j = i.

(73)

the center of a sp consists of all elements (cid:229)

k
j

je j,a

j  c.

every permutation of sp can be uniquely (modulo order) written as a product of
disjoint cycles. since two cycles are conjugated if and only if their length is the same,
the number of conjugacy classes is equal to the number of partitions of p. denoting
the jth conjugacy class by c j we build the sum of all elements of one class

(69)

(70)

(71)

(74)

(75)

= (cid:229)
.

k j

p  a sp

p c j

which is obviously in the center of a sp, too. so we can expand ki in the basis e j:

ki = hi

k(cid:229)

j=1

f j

j(ci)e j,

where c
j(ci) is the character of the class ci in the representation generated by e j and
hi is the number of elements of ci. the dimension of that representation is equal to the
multiplicity f j.

the constuction of the idempotents can be carried out via the

(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
an assignment of numbers 1, . . . , p into the boxes of a frame is called a young tableau.
given a tableau t , we denote (m) by (m)(t ). if the numbers in every row and in
every column increase the tableau is called standard. the number of standard tableaux
for the frame (m) is denoted by f(m). it is equal to the dimension of the irreducible
representation generated by the idempotent e(m). we will now answer the question

up to order p = 4 the central idempotents are given by the sum of minimal projectors
