abstract

the problem of gauge independent denition of eective gravitational eld
is considered from the point of view of the process of measurement. eective
slavnov identities for the generating functionals of green functions corresponding
to a system of arbitrary gravitational eld measured by a single classical scalar
eld are obtained. these identities are used for explicit evaluation of the total
contribution to the gauge dependent part of the one-loop eective apparatus
action. it is shown that the non-local part of this contribution, describing gauge
dependence of the long-range quantum corrections to the eective equations of
motion of the apparatus, is absent. this result leads to the natural denition of
gauge independent eective gravitational eld in terms characterizing motion of
the measuring device. we show, however, that the whole quantum contribution
is gauge dependent due to generally non-vanishing local part originating from
space-time regions where sources for the gravitational eld are superposed with
the scalar eld. a tentative explanation of appearance of this part is given,
and the question concerning origins of the gauge dependence cancellation in the
non-local part of the eective apparatus action is briey discussed.

1 introduction

quantization of elds, like any other quantization procedure, contains as one of its
inalienable traits an ambiguity in the choice of a set of fundamental variables in terms
of which transition from deterministic classical theory to statistical quantum theory is
to be performed. in quantum mechanics this constitutes the most of what is called the
operator-ordering problem. in the quantum theory of elds this appears as the prob-
lem of dependence of observables on the choice of eld parametrization or, in gauge
theories, on the choice of gauge-xing conditions. nowhere it is better illustrated than
in calculation of the eective elds, i.e. elds incorporating vacuum polarization eects

induced by a given classical solutions. due to special structure of lagrangians of quan-
tum electrodynamics and yang-mills theories gauge dependence of the corresponding
eective elds occurs only beginning with the two-loop approximation of the perturba-
tion theory. instead, in quantum gravity, dependence of the eective gravitational eld
on the gauge (and parametrization) is fully displayed already at the one-loop level1.

most generally, the problem under consideration can be stated as the problem of
gauge and parametrization dependence of the eective action. the latter can be de-
ned either as the sum over all one-particle-irreducible diagrams [1], or as the legendre
transform of the logarithm of green functions generating functional [2]. the latter
denition brings to light the remarkable analogy between classical equations of mo-
tion and the quantum equations describing dynamics of the mean elds. it suggests
natural interpretation of the eective action as the quantum substitute for its classical
counterpart. however, the above-mentioned problem lacks direct physical application
of this analogy.

on the other hand, as we pointed out at the beginning, this drawback is an oblig-
atory consequence of the change in the interpretative framework  non-invariance with
respect to transitions between dierent sets of fundamental variables, with the help of
which averaging procedures are established, is in the very statistical nature of quantum
theory. it disappears only in the classical limit. although this fact is quite obvious,
it should be emphasized that one does not even have to try to prove it, since it is a
direct consequence of bohrs correspondence principle which underlies quantum theory
itself. at this point, we would like to recall that classical conceptions play crucial role
in another important notion of quantum theory  the process of measurement. as
emphasized in [4], the very idea of acquisition of some denite reading by a measuring
device is essentially classical.
in the light of the gauge dependence problem even-
tual classical nature of any process of measurement becomes particularly important.
namely, it raises the question of whether this problem is just a matter of the formal-
ism of eective action itself, or indicates the necessity to include measuring apparatus
into the mathematical description of quantum phenomena explicitly, so as to make it
possible to reformulate the theory of eective quantities in terms characterizing motion
of the apparatus. if the former is true, then we are left with the s-matrix approach
as the only reliable, though very restrictive, means of deriving physical predictions,
while the opposite would mean that we get the most general quantum description at
our disposal2.

the purpose of the present paper is to elaborate the above alternative in the case of
quantum gravity. the crucial role of the process of measurement in approaching to the
problem of gauge dependence of the eective elds was rst put forward by dalvit and
mazzitelli [5], who showed, in the case of quantum gravity, that the equations of motion
(geodesic equation) of a test particle in the weak static eective gravitational eld of
a point mass, calculated in the one-loop approximation up to leading logarithms, are
independent of the choice of linear gauge xing the general coordinate invariance. the
essential thing here is that while the quantum interaction of the test particle with
the gravitational eld is negligible in evaluation of the total eective eld, it is not

1an explicit calculation of the one-loop divergences of the eective action for einstein gravity and

r2-gravity in arbitrary gauge and parametrization can be found in [3]

2this alternative, of course, is exhaustive only as far as the problem of gauge dependence is
concerned. an eventual solution to this problem may well turn out to be unsatisfactory from other
points of view.

when the equations of the test particle motion are being determined. it turns out that
in the latter case the gauge-dependent contribution originating from the graviton-test
particle interaction just cancels that corresponding to the ordinary gauge dependence
of the mean gravitational eld. gauge independence of the equations of motion of the
classical apparatus allows one to dene the gauge independent eective gauge eld as
the eld that enters these equations and couples to the measuring device in the classical
fashion.

this important result raises naturally the following questions: rst of all, is the
aforesaid cancellation just a lucky accident conditioned by the model chosen and the
approximations made in [5], or represents a general property of gauge interactions?
second, if the latter is true, what is the formal mathematical reason underlying the
above-mentioned gauge dependence cancellation? that this cancellation is not a mere
chance in power-counting-renormalizable theories at least in the low-energy limit is
shown quite generally in [6]. there, the use has been made of the ordinary becchi-
rouet-stora-tyutin (brst) symmetry [7] of the faddeev-popov action [8], which is
not, however, a quantum symmetry in the present case, since it includes transformations
of the classical matter describing the measuring device. this symmetry is expressed by
slavnov-type identities for green functions, obtained in [6] and called there eective
slavnov identities. with the help of the renormalization equation following from these
identities, gauge independence of the eective equations of device motion is proved in
the low-energy limit up to leading logarithms.

signicance of the eective slavnov identities is that they allow one to put the
problem of gauge dependence, understood in the sense outlined above, in the most
adequate and technically convenient way. namely, they permit to escape the necessity
of explicit evaluation of the mean elds, which requires solving the corresponding wave
equations, and subsequent substitution of the results into the eective equations of
the apparatus motion, in order to verify the gauge dependence cancellation,  the way
followed in [5]. indeed, as shown in [6], the problem of calculation of the total gauge
dependence of the eective device action reduces to evaluation of the gauge dependence
of connected green functions containing vertices of the gauge eld-device interaction.
it is this simplication that allows us to investigate the problem under consideration
beyond the approximation of leading logarithms. this is the subject of the present
article. we take as an example the quantized gravitational eld measured by a classical
scalar eld. the results presented below, conrming and generalizing those obtained
in [5], reveal one important condition which is necessary for the gauge dependence
cancellation to hold at all energies. namely, it is required that there must be no
superposition of the eld describing the apparatus with the sources of the gravitational
eld. in turn, this raises an interesting question of whether or not fullment of this
condition is implied by the classical nature of the measuring apparatus.

our paper is organized as follows. we begin in sec. 2 with a more detailed formula-
tion of the gauge dependence problem as well as of the approach to it, adopted in this
paper. the eective slavnov identities for the generating functionals of green func-
tions, introduced in sec. 3, are derived in sec. 4. in essential, this derivation reproduces
that given in [6]. in sec. 5, as an illustration of our method, these identities are used
in evaluation of the logarithmic contribution to the -dependent part of the generat-
ing functional of connected green functions,  being the gauge parameter weighting
lorentz-type gauge condition ah + bh = 0. we nd that, as in the case
of the point-like measuring apparatus considered in [5], this contribution is absent for

arbitrary values a, b. the total contribution to the -dependent part of the generating
functional of connected green functions is evaluated in sec. 6 for a special choice of
the gauge parameters, demonstrating non-vanishing of this part in general. the results
obtained are summarized and discussed in sec. 7.

we use the highly condensed notations of dewitt [9] throughout this paper. also
left derivatives with respect to anticommuting variables are used. the dimensional
regularization of all divergent quantities is supposed.

2 preliminaries

before we proceed to alculations, we would like to give a somewhat more detailed
account of the main aspects of the gauge dependence problem, briey mentioned in
the introduction.

2.1 the origin of the problem

first of all, we would like to point out the close connection of the gauge dependence
problem with the analogous problem of dependence of the eective action on the choice
of eld parametrization. roughly speaking, imposition of the gauge conditions in a
gauge theory, being equivalent to picking a subset out of the total set of variables de-
scribing the theory, includes, in particular, freedom to perform arbitrary substitutoins
among the variables of the subset. the parametrization dependence problem is just
the reection of this freedom possessed by any gauge as well as non-gauge eld theory.
as a matter of fact, any like the above reasoning has restricted validity in eld theory
because of the fundamental locality requirements. nevertheless, it is a general result
of the batalin-vilkovisky method [11] that the behavior of the eective action under
variations of the gauge conditions is essentially the same as under arbitrary changes of
parametrization  both are represented by anticanonical transformations (in the sense
of the batalin-vilkovisky antibracket). this result is established in full generality in
[12] and, furthermore, is valid in renormalized as well as unrenormalized theory. in
view of this fact, one can speak about either gauge or parametrization dependence of
the eective action.

let us now turn to the problem itself. as we have already mentioned above, its
origin is in the inevitable ambiguity in the choice of a set of fundamental variables in
terms of which the quantization procedure is carried out. consider a simple example.
let the system be described by an action s() which is a function of a single scalar
eld (x) and suppose that the functional integral measure can be chosen simply as
the product of d(x). then the mean eld (y) is

h(y)i = z yx

d(x)(y) exp{is()},

(1)

the subscript  indicates that the role of fundamental dynamical variable is played
here by the eld  itself. nothing prevents us, however, from taking as fundamental
any other eld  = f (), f () being an arbitrary non-degenerate function, in which
case eq. (1) is replaced by

h(y)i = z yx

d(x)(y) exp{is()}, s()  s(f 1()).

(2)

employing dimensional regularization and assuming for simplicity that the function
f () does not contain derivatives of , so that (0)-type expressions are set equal to
zero, we rewrite eq. (2) as

h(y)i = z yx

d(x)f ((y)) exp{is()} = hf ((y))i.

(3)

since there is no reason to prefer one way of quantization to the other, in particular,
one denition of the mean eld to the other, one can try at least to compare the two.
obviously, the only way to do this is to use the relation  = f (). consider, e.g.,
the  picture. on the one hand, as it follows from eq. (1), the mean eld is equal to
h(y)i. in view of eq. (2), on the other hand, it is equal to f 1(h(y)i). thus,
taking into account eq. (3) we conclude that the change  = f () of fundamental
variables leads to the following change in value of the mean eld

conversely, in the  picture, one arrives at the rule

h(y)i  f 1(hf ((y))i).

h(y)i  f (hf 1((y))i).

(4)

(5)

assumptions concerning the regularization scheme and the function f (), made
above, play no role: the same transformation rule (4) applies in the general case, as
it follows from the results of [13]. obviously, ambiguity expressed by this rule is an
indispensable consequence of statistical nature of quantum eld theory together with
complete equivalence of various pictures (i.e., formulations in various sets of variables)
at the classical level. we would like to emphasize in this connection that the very use
of the relation  = f () in comparison of the two quantum pictures above is by itself
essentially classical. yet this deprives the transformations (4) of any signicance in
the quantum domain, whereas at the classical level these turn, of course, into a trivial
identity. nevertheless, requirement of invariance with respect to the transformations
(4) is taken in [14] as the starting point in construction of a modication of the ordinary
eective action, aimed at derivation of physically sensible predictions. as it follows
from what we just said, apart from the question of whether the action proposed in [14]
is actually gauge independent, such object would have nothing to do with the genuine
problem of gauge dependence. instead, one is prompted by the above discussion to seek
the way out of this diculty in reformulation of the theory in classical terms. this
is exactly what is done in [5]. eective gravitational eld is dened there through the
eective equations of motion of a classical test particle, namely, as the eld that takes
place of the classical gravitational eld in the ordinary geodesic equation. obviously,
this is the only denition relevant to the state of aairs in the light of the process of
measurement. indeed, in any case it is motion of specic classical apparatus measuring
the eld at any given space-time interval that is only observed. thus, it is value of the
eld entering classical equations of motion of the apparatus that is only important.

following [5], we consider the apparatus as testing, i.e., as an innitely small dis-
turbance of the gravitational eld it measures. let us now show how this technical
assumption allows one to simplify the calculations to be performed below.

2.2 the role of simple connectedness

since we are interested mainly in answering the question of whether the eective eld
dened in the sense of dalvit and mazzitelli is actually gauge independent, rather
than in its specic value, especially in the case of quantum gravity, we can simplify
evaluation of the total gauge dependent part of the eective device action as follows. as
is explained in the introduction, this part is the sum of two dierent contributions. the
rst is the ordinary explicit gauge dependence of the eective device action. the second
stems from its implicit gauge dependence through the mean gauge eld. it is exactly
this dependence of the mean gravitational eld that lacks its physical interpretation.
let the measuring apparatus be described by a set of classical elds, denoted as .
then, if  stands for the -dependent part of the generating functional of one-particle-
irreducible green functions, , we have, for the full variation of the eective device
action under a small change  of a gauge parameter :

d(h, , ) =

 +


h



 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h,

h

 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t,

 

d
d

,

(6)

where t  {t } is the source for the gravitational eld, and h  {h} is the mean
deviation of the metric from minkowskian.
now note, that if the quantity w is dened by analogy with , i.e., as the -

dependent part of the generating functional of connected green functions, w , then

(h, , ) = w(t, , )|t t (h,) ,

since the device contribution is innitesimal.

comparing eqs. (6) and (7) we arrive at the following important relation

d(h, , )

d

=

w(t, , )



.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)hh(t,)

due to this result, transition to the strongly connected diagrams in the eective
slavnov identities derived below becomes unnecessary. this fact is of considerable
importance since these identities, unlike the ordinary ones, contain second derivatives
of the generating functionals with respect to the sources, making the above-mentioned
transition awkward.

3 the quantum action and the generating function-

als

the method we approach the gauge dependence problem allows consideration of arbi-
trary space-time congurations. the simplest way to set up any desired is to choose
properly the standard source term normally introduced into the generating functional
of green functons. thus, the role of the eld t  introduced already in eqs. (68) will
be not only to serve as the variable of the legendre transformation, but also to provide
a convenient substitute for realistic matter sources. the only trace of the latter is the
conservation law

t  = 0,

where the covariant derivatives are dened with respect to the metric h0 satisfying

f is the most general covariant gauge condition linear in h. finally, we assume that
the measuring device can be described by a single scalar eld , its action being

(13)

the action s+s is invariant under the following (innitesimal) gauge transformations5

brst = d()c,

(19)

 being a constant anticommuting parameter.

brst transformation rule for the -eld is here separated from the rest to em-
phasize the special role played by the measuring device in the present formalism. on
the one hand, eqs. (18), (19) span the usual brst transformation of the quantum
action (17). on the other hand, in derivation of the eective slavnov identities below,
the -eld being classical does not take a part in the quantum brst transformation,
i.e., transformation of the path integral measure in the generating functional of green
functions6

z[t, , , k, k, l] = z dhdcd c exp{i( + c + c  + t h)},

before we continue, we would like to make some notes on the form of the generating
functional (20). it is because of its classical nature the eld  is absent in the func-
tional integral measure in eq. (20). the quantum propagation of this eld is thereby
neglected. furthermore, the same classical nature allows -eld to be considered as a
c-function. in terms of the creation a and annihilation a operators this is expressed
as the approximate commutativity

justied if the occupation numbers of the quantum states involved are large compared
with the unity. it is worth to recall in this connection that in quantum eld theory
the classical requirements can be applied only to a nite, although otherwise arbitrary,
region of eld spectrum. in particular, the above condition on the value of the occu-
pation numbers inevitably becomes meaningless when applied to all energies. we see,
therefore, that the above form of the generating functional is an immediate consequence
of bohrs correspondence principle underlying the whole quantum theory.

it is to be mentioned, however, that it is in the case of the gravitational interaction
where the usual procedure of transition to the classical limit does not work. namely,
it is senseless to increase the apparatus mass in order to suppress its quantum contri-
bution, since the same mass multiplies vertices of the graviton-apparatus interaction.
in short, there is no such thing as the classical source for gravity [16]. in this paper,
we follow [5], and put the device action into the classical form (13) by hands. we
will turn to this back in sec. 6.

as we mentioned in sec. 2.1, the parametrization dependence problem is in fact a
part of the more general problem of gauge dependence. below we consider the latter
case as the more familiar. to illustrate the essence of our approach as well as of the
main result it is sucient to consider the most important kind of the gauge dependence,
6for brevity, the product symbol, as well as tensor indices of the elds h, c, c , is omitted in

the path integral measure.

namely, dependence on the weighting parameter . to accomplish this, we modify the
quantum action adding the term

y f c ,

y being a constant anticommuting parameter [17]. thus we write the generating
functional of green functions as

z[t, , , k, k, l, y ] = z dhdcd c exp{i( + y f c  + c + c  + t h)}.

to complete our denitions, we introduce the generating functional of connected

green functions

w [t, , , k, k, l, y ] = i ln z[t, , , k, k, l, y ],

(21)

and then dene the eective action  in the usual way as the legendre transform of
w with respect to the mean elds

h =

c =

c  =

(denoted by the same symbols as the corresponding eld operators):

in the standard interpretation, the reciprocal to equations (22),


h

= t ,

(22)

(23)

are the eective equations of motion for the full quantum corrected eld h.

4 the eective slavnov identities

in terms of green functions, the gauge symmetry (14) is expressed by slavnov-type
identities, to derive which we perform a brst shift (18) of integration variables in the
path integral (20). unlike the usual case, however, the modied quantum action  is
not invariant under this operation, since, as we have mentioned above, the classical
eld  does not take a part in it. therefore, we obtain the following identity

s

0 = z dhdcd c"i

 d

since s itself must be invariant under brst-transformations (18), (19)

s
h

d
c = 

s


dc.

(25)

then the rst term in square brackets on the left hand side of eq. (24) can be rewritten
as follows

cc exp{  },

 d


c exp{  }

(26)

where the second of eqs. (15), as well as the locality of generator d() together with
property (0) = 0, were taken into account.

next, the second term in the square brackets in eq. (24) can be transformed with
the help of the quantum ghost equation of motion which is obtained by performing a
shift c  c +  c of integration variables in the functional integral (20):
z dhdcd chf ,

c  y f + i exp{i( + y f c  + c + c  + t h)} = 0,

 d

from which it follows that

yz dhdcd c"i c f ,

 d

# exp{  } = 0,

where the use of the property y 2 = 0 has been made, and the expression /  (0)
is again omitted. putting all together, we rewrite eq. (24)

(27)

this is the sought eective slavnov identity for the generating functional of green
functions. for the case l =  =  = 0 it was obtained in [6].
in terms of the
generating functional of connected green functions, it looks like

appearance of the second derivatives in eqs. (27), (28) is to be emphasized. recall
that it is presence of higher derivatives (with respect to the sources or mean elds) that
makes application of the original formulation of slavnov identities much less straightfor-
ward than of their later reformulation in terms of the sources of brst transformations,
given by zinn-justin [15] and used in our derivation above. however, even the latter
approach does not prevent appearance of the second derivatives in eective slavnov
identities. but for relation (8) this would have complicated subsequent application of
these identities considerably.

5 gauge independence of the leading low-energy

quantum corrections

in this section, identity (28) will be used to prove absence of the logarithmical contri-
bution to the -dependent part of the eective device action. the results of [5] acquire
thereby signicant extension. in particular, the gauge dependence cancellation turns
out to be neither the product of special choice of the source for gravitational eld,
nor the result of the approximations made in [5] (non-relativistic motion in the weak
gravitational eld).

to show the cancellation of the -dependent logarithms, it is sucient to prove
niteness of the corresponding part of the eective device action. indeed, as a simple
dimensional analysis shows, dimensionally regularized one-loop feynman integrals

i = z d4kf (p1, ..., pn, k),

(29)

where   dimensional regulator,   mass scale, have, in massless theory, the following
structure

i = c1p  2

(30)

ci, i = 1, 2, 3 and  being some numbers depending on specic form of f (p, k).
it
follows from eq. (30) that one can obtain the logarithmic contribution from divergent
one substituting

(31)

so, let us proceed to calculation of the gauge dependent divergences of the apparatus
action.

setting l =  =  = 0 in eq. (28) and extracting its y -dependent part, we have

k  +

w


w
 k  i

2w

where w, w are dened by

w = w + y w ,

and the sources k , k are also set zero after dierentiation.

finally, extraction of the -dependent part of eq. (32) gives

w

(32)

(33)

the subscript  denoting the -independent part of the corresponding quantity. since
the source k is set here equal to zero after dierentiation, notion of -dependence
retains its meaning given in sec. 2.2.

thus, according to eq. (8), to determine the full -dependence of divergent contri-
bution to the eective apparatus action one has to evaluate divergences of the right
hand side of eq. (33). however, because of zero dimensionality of the gravitational eld

calculation of innity of diagrams with arbitrary number of external graviton lines is
required. the standard way round this diculty is the use of the background eld
method together with an appropriate choice of the gauge conditions [9]. this leads
to the explicitly gauge invariant eective action [10], which allows one to conne the
calculation by the lowest order of the weak eld approximation, and then restore the
whole gauge invariant contribution on dimensional grounds. it should be emphasized,
however, that in our case the very use of this method is under question. indeed, func-
tional dependence of the gauge conditions on the background eld is to be considered
here on equal footing with the dependence on the gauge parameters , . therefore,
the background eld method itself can be used only after the eective apparatus action
is shown to be independent of such modication of the gauge conditions, just like as in
the s-matrix approach the use of this method is justied by the gauge independence
of the scattering matrix.

it is worthwhile to note that exactly the background eld method was used in [5]
in evaluating the quantum corrections to the geodesic equation, as an intermediate
step of which one had to solve the eective equations of motion for the (background)
gravitational eld.
it is, however, the main achievement of the method that these
equations are gauge invariant [10]. as was emphasized in [5], to solve them one is
free to choose any gauge conditions. the solution depends, of course, on this choice,
but this is the ordinary harmless gauge dependence encountered in any classical gauge
theory, which does not lead to gauge dependence of gauge invariant functionals of this
solution. this, however, raises the question which of the two sets of gauge conditions
 the one used to x the gauge freedom of integration variables in the path integral, or
the one used to solve the equations of motion  is to be considered as the gauge xing
for the eective gravitational eld dened in the sense of dalvit and mazzitelli7. it
seems that, in the background eld method, it is the gauge conditions imposed on the
background eld, which are to be considered also as the gauge-xing for the eective
eld, though without detailed proof this is only a probable conjecture.

it should be emphasized, however, that all these are only particularities of the back-
ground eld method itself. we do not use this method in our approach, in which the
gauge freedom of the mean gravitational eld is automatically xed by the conditions
imposed on the path integral variables, so the above alternative is never raised,

on the other hand, the questions of method are actually irrelevant to the problem
under consideration, since the very classical nature of the measuring device implies that
its eective action is gauge invariant. this allows us to go on the above-mentioned way
of restoring the whole gauge invariant contribution from its lowest order approximation.
due to arbitrariness of the source t  this procedure causes no loss of generality, unlike
that used in [5] where all the calculations (evaluation of the one-loop eective action,
solving the wave equation for the eective gravitational eld) were performed in the
given eld of a point mass, making thereby the weakness condition essential.

let us now proceed to evaluation of the right hand side of eq. (33) in the lowest
order of the weak eld approximation. as the subsequent calculation shows, the result
is linear in the curvature, so the lowest non-vanishing contribution is given by diagrams
with one external graviton, pictured in figs. 1, 2, and 3 representing the rst, second,
and third term in the right hand side of eq. (33), respectively. note that the diagrams
of fig. 3(a,b,c) are obtained from the tree diagrams shown in fig. 4(a,b,c), respectively,

7in [5], the two are simply taken to coincide, putting thereby the question o.

where

r =

eq. (9) becomes the ordinary energy-momentum conservation law

t  = 0.

(35)

since all tensor quantities under consideration (t , h etc.) are small, their indices
are raised and lowered with the help of the at-space metric , . remembering
the form of generators of gauge transformations, eq. (14), we see that because of the
conservation law, eq. (35), all diagrams of the type shown in fig. 1(f) are equal to
zero.

the ordinary slavnov identities also help us to show that the diagram pictured in
fig. 1(d) cancels the sum of diagrams in figs. 2(c) and 2(d). for this purpose, we
neglect device contribution, dierentiate eq. (33) twice with respect to  and t ,
and set all the sources, including t , equal to zero

tion, identity (36), contracted with t , is shown in fig. 5.

this gure, together with the identity (37) and the relation

makes it clear that the sum of diagrams in figs. 1(d), and 2(c,d) is equal to zero
identically. we would like to empasize that the diagrams 2(c,d) are not equal to zero,
as would be the case if the background eld method were used.

finally, diagrams 1(e) and 3(c) are zeros identically too. as for the latter, this
follows simply from the fact that there is no external momentum ow in the linearly
divergent loop integral, while in the former we have 0
0-type indeniteness. it is easy
to see, however, that this tadpole is to be set zero. indeed, let the constant anticom-
muting source y be considered as the limit of a sequence of functions with innitely
expanding carriers on which the functions have the same constant value except for

thus, the diagrams of figs. 1(a,b,c), 2(a,b), and 3(a,b) remain to be calculated.
since each diagram contains only one -vertex, two sets of diagrams corresponding
to the two terms in eq. (13) must cancel independently. below we present detailed
calculation of these diagrams with -vertices generated by the mass term. evidently,
one has to expand this term up to the second order in the gravitational eld

the three graviton vertex encountered in diagrams 1(c), 2(a), and 3(b), need not
be calculated explicitly. indeed, with the help of identity (37), graviton propagator en-

generator d(0)
attached to the three graviton vertex. the latter, therefore, can be
expressed through the second variation of einstein action

now, calculation of diagrams is straightforward. the tensor multiplication as well
as integration over angles in the momentum space is performed with the help of the
new tensor package for reduce system [18]. the result of the calculation is the

it is easy to verify that the sum of these polynomials is zero. in view of arbitrariness
of the eld h this result obtained in the rst order of the weak eld approximation

is extended to all orders noting that the expression z d4x22h is the rst term of
the weak eld expansion of explicitly invariant functional z d4xg22r (which is

unique due to power counting together with the structure of the leading contribution).
very complicated mutual cancellation of diagrams is to be especially emphasized.
this is illustrated in table 1 where diagrams contributing to terms of various powers
of the gauge parameters are collected. it is hardly believed that this cancellation is a
matter of chance. it seems, on the other hand, that no immediate reason underlying this
phenomenon can be indicated. one might think that the eective slavnov identities
obtained above do not exhaust all consequences of the gauge symmetry possessed by the
system under consideration, or yet not all consequences of these identities themselves
have been inferred. however, it should be noted that the relations supposed to lie in the
origin of the gauge dependence cancellation would have their nature quite dierent from
that of slavnov identities, which, in the regularized theory, is purely combinatorial.
this is because the cancellation of diagrams, found above, is not a cancellation of
integrands: as we will see in the next section, the sum of nite contributions of diagrams
figs. 1-3 is not zero.

evaluation of divergences of the right hand side of eq. (33) in the case when the
vertices of the gravitational eld-device interaction are generated by the kinetic term
of the scalar eld action (13) is more complicated because of appearance of terms
with dierent tensor structures. we do not write out the corresponding cumbersome

expressions for individual contributions of diagrams figs. 1-3, mentioning only that,
as in the case of diagrams originating from the mass term, they cancel each other
completely.

to conclude this section, we state the main result: the non-local (logarithmical)
part of the one-loop eective action for the classical scalar eld measuring an arbitrary
gravitational eld is independent of the gauge parameter  for all values of , ,

absence of the logarithmical contribution to the gauge dependent part of the eective
device action, found in the previous section (and in [5] for a dierent choice of appa-
ratus), raises an important question of whether this part is totally zero. the results of
this section resolve this question negatively.

below we calculate the whole contribution of diagrams of figs. 1-3 for a particular
choice of the gauge parameters , . namely, we set  = 0,  = 1, strongly simplifying
the propagators (40), (41), and reducing all calculation considerably. following the

two important aspects of this result are to be emphasized. the rst concerns structure
of the classical device action (13). as we have already mentioned, the ordinary pro-
cedure of transition from quantum to classical theory does not make sense in the case
of gravity theory, since the relative value of the quantum corrections is independent
of the apparatus mass. therefore, even if the eld  can be considered classically, its
dynamics is to be described by an action which diers from (13) by terms of order h
corresponding to the nite corrections due to interaction of quantized scalar and grav-
itational elds. these, of course, are also gauge-dependent. thus, to determine the
gauge-dependent contribution to the eective action of the scalar eld completely, the
above-mentioned terms have to be taken into account as well. their contribution may
well cancel (53).

second, it should be noted that the result (53) is local, in the sense that it is super-
position of the eld  with the sources for the gravitational eld, that only contributes
to the gauge-dependent part of the eective apparatus action.
indeed, contracting
einstein equations (34),

we can rewrite eq. (53)

(55)

on the other hand, contribution having the structure r d4x()h, allowed by power

counting, would not be local in the above sense.

we would like to mention, however, that the locality property may well be lost if
one is to take into account quantum corrections to the classical form of the action for
the scalar eld, discussed above.

7 discussion and conclusion

the results of the present work, considered in the light of the role played by the process
of measurement in mathematical formulation of quantum theory, are twofold. on the
one hand, the striking cancellation of gauge dependence in the eective equations of
apparatus motion at low energies, demonstrated in sec. 5, indicates undoubtedly that

inclusion of the classical measuring apparatus into interpretative framework of quantum
theory at the formal level is as necessary as for practical needs. it is hardly believed
that the gauge dependence problem can be solved otherwise. on the other hand, this
cancellation is not complete: as we showed in sec. 6, there is a non-zero contribution
to the gauge dependent part of the eective device action, coming from regions of
space-time where the sources for gravitational eld are superposed with the classical
eld describing apparatus. we have already mentioned that this may well turn out to
be the consequence of peculiarity of the gravitational interaction, conditioned simply
by the fact that the strength of this interaction is proportional to the apparatus mass,
depriving thereby the usual transition to the classical limit of sense. it is important to
note, however, that in the framework of the perturbation theory this is just a technical
diculty which requires only careful successive account of the corresponding corrections
to the classical form of apparatus action.

the results of the present work, considered on their own, raise an important question
of reasons the gauge dependence cancellation originates from. since this cancellation
takes place among the logarithmical contributions of feynman integrals only, it cannot
be a consequence of combinatorics of the eective slavnov identities. needless to say
that it cannot be explained with the help of arguments like those used in proves of
gauge independence of the s-matrix neither, since these arguments include as their
essential point imposition of the physical renormalization conditions, which is revealed
formally in the necessity to perform nite wave-function renormalizations along with
changes of gauge conditions, while the issue of renormalization is absolutely irrelevant
to the problem under consideration.

leaving this question open we would like to note only that its eventual resolution
would serve as a valuable guide in investigation of the fundamental role played by the
measurement process in quantum theory, of which description presented above is just
a phenomenology.
