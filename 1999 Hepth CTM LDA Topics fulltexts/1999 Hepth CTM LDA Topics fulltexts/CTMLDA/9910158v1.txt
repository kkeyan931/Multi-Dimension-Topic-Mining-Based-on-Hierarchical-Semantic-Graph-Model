in a recent letter, carlip proposed a generalization of the brown-henneaux-strominger con-
struction to any dimension. we present two criticisms about his formulation.

recently carlip [1] proposed a generalization of the brown-henneaux-strominger construc-
tion to any dimension based on the algebra of deformations at a black hole horizon. by restrict-
ing to the horizon of a black hole, he has shown that the algebra contains a virasoro subalgebra
independent of the spatial dimensions with the appropriate boundary conditions. with the aid
of cardy formula he derived the bekenstein-hawking entropy within the conformal eld theory.
in this comment, we point out that (a) his analysis has a serious error which invalidates one
of its principal claims and (b) independent of that error there is one more serious defect.

the error (a) occurs in 2j[ 1] (10) of ref. [1] which essentially claims that it should be anti-
symmetric under 1  2 interchange according to his identication of 2j[1] = {j[2], j[1]} (
{,} denotes the dirac bracket). but this is not correct identication because the antisymmetry
can not be attained with his choice of j[] (9) and hence the virasoro algebra, whose existence
is one of its principal claims, can not be obtained in his form. let us explain our conclusion in
detail. we rst note that the last two terms of 2j[ 1] have no manifest antisymmetricity for
indices. in his paper [1], he assumed 2
1 to get the antisymmetricity by hand.

but, this assumption is not acceptable because one can show that 2
1 = 0 which is essentially
1 = 0. hence, the 2j[ 1] is not antisymmetric under 1  2 because
because 2
of the last two terms although it is antisymmetric for the rst two terms in (13). one can not
obtain the virasoro algebra with this preliminary algebra.

about the origin of this failure, we found that it is a direct consequence of the non-
dierentiability of l = h + j contrast to his claim. j does not cancel the boundary terms
in h exactly, rather it introduces several additional boundary terms in l: most of these
terms have no contribution on the horizon because of his boundary condition n 2|r+ = 0 but
two of them can not be neglected and these two contributions make l non-dierentiable. let
us explain rst why the dierentiability of l is connected to the antisymmetrization of 2j[1].
when l is the correct dieomorphism (di) generator ,i.e., {l[], } =  for any dynamical
variables , the di transformation of l can be expressed as l[] = {l[], l[]}. when the
constraint h  0 is imposed this will reduce to : j[] = {j[], j[]} by picking out the
boundary parts of l[] according to the denition of the dirac bracket. according to this
identication, j[] is antisymmetric under    explicitly as l[] is. now, let us consider
the (general) variation of l to investigate its dierentiability:

l =

where the contributions of . . .  terms to the di transformation  are order of o(n 2) or
o(n) which vanish on the horizon. from these two non-vanishing boundary contributions, we

get the corresponding anomalous boundary contributions in the following di transformations:

grr + bulk,

grr(x) = {l[], grr(x)}

(x) = {l[], (x)}

(nr t) + bulk,

whose boundary contributions behave as (r  r+)  o(1) which can not be neglected. here,
the bulk part will represent the usual di transformations in the bulk. these wrong di
transformations implies that carlips original choice of j[] is not correct one to make l[] be
the di generator for the system with the horizon boundary and to give the claimed virasoro
algebra.

criticism (b) consists of the observation that even upon ignoring point (a), his scenario
does not work for the non-rotating black hole even though it works well for the rotating case.
recently a resolution has been suggested in a dierent context of 2d gravity by cadoni and
mignemi [2] who have introduced the time-integrated generator instead of (usual) xed-time
generator. but we do not think that this can be resolved even in the way of cadoni and mignemi
although the time integration of (21) for the non-rotating case gives the similar result as the
rotating case with dierent central charge c = 3a/(gt ) and dierent l0 = at /(8g) [3].
a strange fact is that the resulting entropy log(l0) = 2  a
4g has a wrong factor of 2 which
remind us a similar wrong factor in their computation of 2d-gravity entropy [2]. more serious
problem of this method is that the time integration of the left-hand sides of (21) can not be
written as { j[m], j[n]} for time-integrated generator j = 1
 r 
0 dtj(t), which is essential for
the interpretation of (21) as a virasoro algebra.
