abstract

the chiral phase structure of the nambu-jona-lasinio/gross-neveu model at nite

temperature t and nite chemical potential  is investigated using (wilsonian) non-
perturbative renormalization group (nprg). in the large nc limit, the solutions of

nprg with various cuto schemes are shown. for a suciently large ultra-violet
cuto, nprg results coincide with those of schwinger-dyson equation and have little

cuto scheme dependence. next, to improve the approximation, we incorporate the
mesonic uctuations. we introduce the auxiliary elds for mesons, and then derive
nprg equation for nite nc. the chiral phase structure on (t, ) plane beyond the

leading of 1/nc expansion is investigated in the sharp cuto limit. nc dependence of
chiral phase diagram is obtained.

introduction

1.

explorations of the phase structure of hot/dense qcd or its toy models are of theoretical

interest, and it is relevant to the heavy ion experiments planned at rhic and lhc. at nite
temperature and density, the vacuum is expected to move to the quark gluon plasma (qgp)

phase via the phase transition, where chiral symmetry is recovered and quarks and gluons
are deconned. since the phase transition to qgp phase is a non-perturbative phenomenon,

we need a non-perturbative analysis to understand it. unfortunately, there are not so many
methods to deal with such problems: lattice monte carlo simulation, schwinger-dyson equa-

tion (sde), 1/n expansion,  expansion. non-perturbative renormalization group (nprg)
is also one of the methods for such a purpose. the eectiveness of the nprg method in the
non-perturbative phenomena has been investigated by many authors. 1), 2)

non-perturbative renormalization group equations describe the response from the change
of infra-red momentum cuto  and can be written down exactly. they are the functional

dierential equations for the wilsonian eective action in which the quantum correction
from the high energy modes (p > ) are already incorporated. in the practical analysis, we

approximate the theory space, the functional space of the eective action, and project the
renormalization group equation (rge) onto this sub-space. by enlarging this sub-space,
we can improve the approximations systematically. in some cases, the evaluated physical
quantities converge fast under such a process. 3) this is an advantageous feature of the
nprg method compared to the asymptotic series, e.g. the perturbation theory,  expansion

and 1/n expansion.

in this article we investigate the chiral phase structure of nambu-jona-lasinio (njl)/gross-

neveu (gn) model 4), 5) at nite temperature and nite chemical potential. the exploration
of the phase diagram is of fundamental interest. if the analysis is extended to qcd, it is
of use for the early universe, the astrophysics of neutron stars and the physics of heavy

ion collisions. we employ nprg method for the analyses.
it is worth while to examine
the applicability of nprg method, because there does not exist so many other tools for

non-perturbative analyses and they do not necessarily work well in any situation.

in lattice monte carlo calculation, much exploration has been made in the system at
nite temperature, 6) while the behavior at nite density is much less understood. the
non-vanishing chemical potential  makes fermion determinant to be a complex number,
and therefore straightforward monte carlo methods can not be applied. at present, two
known candidates avoiding this diculty, i.e. glasgow algorithm 7) and imaginary chemical
potential  = i method, 8) require much larger computer resource but unfortunately do not
bring any denite results. most of the eorts have been done using sde, but it is dicult

2

to improve the approximation systematically.

this paper is organized as follows.

in  2 we derive the evolution equation which is
one of the non-perturbative renormalization group equations and explain local potential
approximation (lpa). 9)
in  3 we discuss the chiral phase structure in the large nc limit,
and compare with the results from sde for the fermion mass function (q). due to the

formal equivalence of two methods in the large nc limit, our large nc result should coincide
with that of sde. we show consistent results can be obtained in the framework of nprg
method. in  4, we investigate the phase structure beyond the large nc approximation. non-
perturbative renormalization group method can approximately incorporate the higher order

diagrams in 1/nc expansion within local potential approximation. the nc dependence of the
chiral phase diagram will be presented there.  5 is devoted to the summary and discussions.

2. evolution equation and local potential approximation

there are three formulations of the non-perturbative renormalization group, the wegner-
houghton equation, the polichinski equation and the evolution equation. 10) - 12) they are
the continuous version of the block spin transformation written in the momentum space and

describe the response of lowering the infra-red momentum cuto . we can nd the exact
form of renormalization group equation (rge) for the wilsonian eective action and/or the
eective average action. the latter one is the one particle irreducible part of the wilsonian

eective action. by lowering the cuto we have the eective action at large distance and
incorporate the radiative corrections from the high energy modes. in this article, we employ

the evolution equation in ref.12) and apply to the nambu-jona-lasinio (njl)/gross-neveu
(gn) model 4), 5) at nite temperature t and chemical potential .

solve it without approximation. as a rst step of our approximation, we neglect higher
derivative terms and keep z factor to be unity. it is called the local potential approximation

contribute to our  functions.

3. phase structure in the large nc limit

in this section, we explore the phase structure of the gross-neveu model 5) at nite
temperature and chemical potential in the large nc limit. we attempt to apply the nprg
method to gn model at t 6= 0 and  6= 0, and show nprg reproduces consistent results
with sde. 14)
in the large nc limit, only the rst diagram (a) in fig. 1 contributes to the
 function of the four-fermi couplings. the  function of the scalar four-fermi coupling
gs  g1 is a function of gs alone,

(3.1)

where t is the cuto scale parameter i.e.  = 0 exp(t). a prole of the threshold function
i(a, b; bt ,b) is given in appendix a. the characters with hat are the dimensionless coupling
constant, e.g. bgs = gs/d2. the rst term of the right hand side (rhs) of eq.(3.1)

corresponds to the canonical scaling and the second one to the radiative correction. at zero

temperature and zero chemical potential, we nd the two-phase structure by solving the
rge numerically. the rg ow diagram is shown in fig. 2. there are two phases divided

by critical coupling, the strong coupling phase and the weak coupling phase. in the strong
coupling phase, the four-fermi coupling constant blows up to the innity at nite scale t. by
evaluating the eective potential of meson elds, we can recognize that the chiral symmetry
is spontaneously broken in this phase. 2) in the weak coupling phase, the four-fermi coupling
goes to zero and chiral symmetry is not broken.

let us discuss hot and dense matter. the broken chiral symmetry at zero temperature and
zero chemical potential is restored at some critical temperature tc and/or critical chemical

in fig. 3. there is the critical temperature, below which the four-fermi coupling constant
blows up to the innity. on the other hand, above the critical temperature the four-fermi
coupling turns to decrease exponentially.

the temperature/chemical potential dependence of various quantities can be found by
solving rge with the same initial condition as that of t =  = 0. there are the critical

chiral symmetry is restored. we can estimate the critical temperature and the critical

with some xed initial condition, or equivalently bare coupling constant. the initial condition
should be given at 0  . however, then we must calculate contributions of innite
number of matsubara modes since t / = bt goes to zero.
in the practical analysis,

we solve the rg ow equations with the common initial condition at the suciently large
but nite ultra-violet cuto 0.
if 0 is suciently large compared with t and , the
solutions will reach the scaling region where the renormalized information i.e. 0  
limit is obtained. this corresponds to tuning the bare four-fermi coupling constant to the
critical one : bgs|=0 = bg
s is the critical coupling constant at

become to make no contribution within the accuracy of numerical computation. in bt  0 limit, however,

) thus the ratio of these quantities
is independent of the initial value of the four-fermi coupling for the scaling region. the
practical problem in the calculations is how large 0 is needed to reach the scaling region.

region if we set the initial condition at 0 > 33 t . however, in practice, we must check
whether the physical quantities scale correctly or not, since it may depend on the quantities
to calculate. we perform the scaling check by calculating a ratio of critical temperature (or
chemical potential) and m0. here m0 is dynamical fermion mass at t =  = 0.

we show the results in fig. 6. if we employ the ultra-violet cuto 0 = 333 tc 0, the
critical points (tc/m0, c/m0) almost coincide with those of sde. here tc 0 is a critical
temperature at  = 0. there is little cuto scheme dependence using this ultra-violet cuto
0. with the ultra-violet cuto 0 = 333 tc 0 these quantities reach the scaling region.
on the other hand, if we choose the ultra-violet cuto 0 = 33 tc 0, the critical points
(tc/m0, c/m0) deviates from those of sde a little. 0 = 33 tc 0 is not sucient to obtain a
scaled quantities. we can calculate scaled critical temperature/chemical potential by setting
the initial condition at 0  333 tc 0. we also plot the results in the sharp cuto case i.e.

in ref. 14), the chiral phase structure of
gn model in 2  d < 4 dimensions were
calculated using sde. the eective poten-
tials are calculated in the leading order of
the 1/nc expansion. it is known that in 2  d < 3 chiral phase transition is of rst order at
low temperature and large chemical potential, and of second order in other region of critical
line. in 3  d < 4, the phase transition is of second order all along the critical line.

large enough, the threshold function i can

if chemical potential b is
take negative value. so even if 1/bgs become
negative, 1/bgs may turn back to the pos-

itive value due to the negative i. thus it

should be regarded as weak coupling phase.
with rge eq.(3.1), this behavior can not

be detected because once bgs blow up to the

innity, then by mistake we may identify it
as the strong coupling phase. indeed, for a

large , it gives an inaccurate (about 10%)

result. the analysis using 1/bgs criticality is

a more favorable method and we may say, it
is a sort of environmentally friendly renor-
malization group. 15)

4. phase structure beyond the 1/nc leading

in the previous section, we explored chiral phase structure in (t, ) plane in the large
nc limit. in this section, we improve the approximation beyond the 1/nc leading in four

dimensional njl model. since we are interested not only in the phase boundary but also in
the order of phase transition, the cjt eective potential 17) should be investigated. let us

there are a yukawa interaction and an eective potential v which is a function of 2 + 2.
here, by a lack of lorentz symmetry, the wave-function renormalization factors of temporal
derivative and those of spatial one are dierent each other.

the rg ow equation for the eective average action e can be derived as done in
 2. in our approximation, the rge becomes a partial dierential equation for the eective
potential v () where  = 1/2  (2 + 2). if we employ the smooth cuto function c(q/)
as done in the previous section, we have to perform the momentum integration with respect

to the spatial momenta numerically for each matsubara modes. it is very time-consuming

11

and not practical. as investigated in the previous section, the results do not depend on
the cuto scheme for a suciently large ultra-violet cuto 0 at least in the large nc limit.
therefore it is more promising way to take the sharp cuto limit of the rg ow equation. 19)
after doing so, we need no momentum integration and therefore the computational time is
reduced drastically. we can not do taylor expansion in momentum components p because
the sharp cuto induces non-analyticity at the origin of the momentum space. 19), 10) instead

we expand one particle irreducible generating functional e in momentum scale |p| = pp.
in general we may express the cuto function c(q/) as c 1(q/) = 1/(|q|, )  1 in
terms of (|q|, ) which is a smooth regularization of heaviside  function of width . in
the sharp cuto limit (  0), (|q|, ) reduces to (|q| ) and the evolution equation for
the eective average action becomes

in this paper, we also approximate zb0 as zb0 = zb.
in the large nc limit, the boson
uctuations disappeared, i.e., b = 0 due to a factor 1/nc. however for nite nc, we must
incorporate the boson loop contributions, b. this is a signicant dierence from the large
nc limit. in general the fermion contribution makes the eective potential evolve downward
as cuto is lowered, while the boson contribution lifts the eective potential upward. ) the
latter is main additional eect for nite nc on the rg evolution of the eective potential

and hence also on the chiral phase structure on (t, ) plane. we shall ignore the corrections
to fermions z factors zf , zf 0 and to yukawa coupling y ) as the rst step toward the
) in momentum scale expansion of sharp cuto eective average action, there emerges a kinetic term
proportional to |p|. the non-analytic dependence on momenta at p = 0 lead to a non-locality in position
space. since the resulting physics in the limit   0 should not suer from this non-locality, it should be
absorbed by a certain counter term. here we simply neglect it in our approximation.

) this is understood from the signs of f and b.
) here, we do not renormalize the boson elds ,  to make their z factor unity, i.e. zb = 1, since at
ultra-violet cuto, it should vanish. therefore in an ordinary sense, our physical yukawa coupling runs due
to bosonic wave-function renormalization.

here, nc = 10. the eective potential
and the eld expectation value are normal-
ized by the dynamical fermion mass m0 at

rge for the eective potential is non-
linear partial dierential equation. here we
do not attempt to expand it in powers of the

elds as done in ref.3), since if the cubic
term of the eld i.e. 3/2 appears in the eec-
tive potential v (), 21) then the naive poly-
nomial approximation of it can not work.

we discretize the rg ow equation in t and
 directions and solve it numerically. we

apply the extended crank-nicholson method
22), 23) which is eective for a non-linear par-
tial dierential equation.

by evaluating the minimum of the eec-
tive potential, we can conclude whether it is

a broken phase or a symmetric one. if there
is a non-trivial minimum at nonzero value of

, it is a broken phase. if the temperature (or the chemical potential) is greater than the
critical one, the eective potential has a minimum at the origin, i.e. the chiral symmetry
is recovered. if the temperature (or the chemical potential) is below the critical one, the

eective potential has a nontrivial minimum. more precisely, in the broken phase, the eec-
tive potential evolves toward the so-called convex one. 25), 26) some results of the eective
potentials are shown in fig. 9.

t/m0

the chiral phase diagram on (t, ) plane is shown in fig. 10. here, the temperature and
the chemical potential are normalized by the dynamical fermion mass m0 = y <  > at zero
temperature and zero chemical potential. in each nc case, the phase transition is found to

be of second order or very weak rst order all along the critical line from th shape of the
eective potentials at the critical points. for example, an eective potential at a critical

point for nc = 10 is shown in fig. 9. nc dependence of the critical line on (t, ) plane is not
small. the critical temperature and the critical chemical potential become small in unit of
m0 if nc is lowered. this is due to the boson uctuations existing for nite nc. intuitively,
we can understand it as follows. the fermionic negative corrections (f ) to the eective
potential are suppressed by a high temperature and/or a large chemical potential, but the
bosonic positive ones (b) are less suppressed due to the existence of matsubara zero mode.
hence if the bosonic part becomes large, that is, the case of small nc, the chiral symmetry

is restored at lower temperature (smaller chemical potential) in comparison with the large
nc case. nc dependence of the critical temperature at  = 0 (tc 0) as well as that of the
critical chemical potential at t = 0 (c 0) are shown in table i. )

) the numerical calculations for nc < 10 need much ner mesh in t direction because b becomes

large. this will be a subject in the forthcoming paper.

5. summary and discussion

we performed a non-perturbative analysis by the (wilsonian) non-perturbative renormal-

ization group in njl/gn model at nite temperature and chemical potential and explored
chiral phase structure on (t, ) plane.

first we explored the phase structure of the gn model at nite temperature and chemical

potential in the large nc limit. we showed that consistent results with those of sde could be
obtained in the framework of nprg method. we investigated how large ultra-violet cuto 0
is needed to obtain scaled quantities. we could calculate scaled critical temperature/chemical
potential by setting the initial condition at 0 = 333 tc 0 and they had little cuto scheme
dependence.

second we improved the approximation beyond the 1/nc leading in four dimensional njl
model. for nite nc, the bosonic uctuations have to be incorporated. in  4, we introduced
the mesonic auxiliary elds , , and derived the ow equation for the eective potential of
these elds v (2 + 2). rg ow equation is then a non-linear partial dierential equation
for this potential. taking account of the possibility of the rst order phase transition like
fig.8 and the cubic term 3/2, 21) we solved the partial dierential equation for v (2 + 2)
without a polynomial expansion employed in ref.3). for several nc, we obtained the chiral
phase structure on (t, ) plane. for nc = 10  , the phase transition is second order or
very weak rst order all along the critical line. the critical temperatures/chemical potentials
depend on nc largely, and become small as nc is decreased. for nc = 10, tc 0 is 78% of
that for nc = .

generalization of this analysis to more realistic models, qcd seems to be straightforward,
except for the treatment of the gauge invariance. by introducing the instanton induced
multi-fermi operator, 24) nprg method can be also applied to the color-superconductor. 27)

s = (d  2)/i0. we
derive the relations between the bare coupling and the physical quantities using an ordinary
procedure. let us focus on the innitesimal neighborhood of gn point, i.e. we consider
the continuum limit of the theory 0  . the critical temperature tc is completely
determined by mutually independent three variables: the bare four-fermi coupling bgs, bare
chemical potential b0 and the ultra-violet cuto 0. the extra b0 dependence of the critical
temperature i.e. tc(bgs, 0;b0) does not aect to the following considerations. now it is
convenient to think that the critical temperature depends on the bare chemical potential b0
through the xed as well as rg invariant dimensionless ratio b0/bt0. as everyone knows, the

rg preserves the physical quantities. therefore, we can realize by solving the rg equations
from 0 to  = 0 that the critical temperature satises,

where we used the solution,

tc(bgs, 0;b0/bt0) = tc((d2)bgs, 0;b0/bt0),

(b.8)

bgs = ce(d2)t = c(0/)d2.
here c is the bare bgs(0). the relation (b.8) can be rewritten by the dimensionless
critical temperature btc(bgs;b0/bt0) = tc(bgs, 0;b0/bt0)/0

) as

(b.9)

(b.10)

btc(bgs;b0/bt0) = btc((d2)bgs;b0/bt0).

hence,

if one starts from the temperature dependent critical chemical potential, then one nds,

) i(bt , 0) is like an approximation of the integral i0 by a histogram, band width of which is 2bt . as
a trapezoidal rule estimate diers from an integral by an order of the square of the width, 22) i(bt , 0) also
diers from i0 by o(bt 2).

. we can renormalize these quantities by taking bgs(0) = (m/0)(d2),
where m is some nite reference mass scale. letting 0  , we nd the continuum limit
of gn model at nite temperature and/or nite chemical potential.

the above observations can be straightforwardly generalized to other models.
