abstract

we discuss bps solitons in gauged n = 2, d = 4 supergravity. the solitons represent extremal
black holes interpolating between dierent vacua of anti-de sitter spaces. the isometry superal-
gebras are determined and the motion of a superparticle in the extremal black hole background
is studied and confronted with superconformal mechanics. we show that the virasoro symmetry
of conformal mechanics, which describes the dynamics of the superparticle near the horizon of
the extremal black hole under consideration, extends to a symmetry under the w algebra of
area-preserving dieomorphisms. we nd that a virasoro subalgebra of w can be associated
to the virasoro algebra of the asymptotic symmetries of ads2. in this way spacetime dieomor-
phisms of ads2 translate into dieomorphisms in phase space. we have computed the central
charge and found complete agreement with the result in ads2: our system oers an explicit re-
alization of the ads2/cf t1 correspondence. we also present generalizations of superconformal
mechanics which are invariant under n = 1 and n = 2 superextensions of w.

1 introduction

solitonic objects play an important role in string theory.
in particular, the study of
certain p-branes in supergravity theories, which interpolate between minkowski space at
innity, and products of anti-de sitter spaces and compact einstein manifolds near the
horizon, led to the ads/cf t correspondence [1, 2, 3]. in the present paper, we extend
the discussion of interpolating solitons to the case of gauged supergravities. in particular
we concentrate on the gauged n = 2, d = 4 theory [4, 5]. a salient feature of the
solitons in the gauged theory, which distinguishes them from corresponding objects in the
ungauged case, is that their near-horizon limit involves not only products of ads spaces
and positive curvature manifolds (like the ads2  s 2 bertotti-robinson solution, which
arises as the near-horizon limit of the extremal reissner-nordstrom black hole), but also
spacetimes like ads2  h 2 (h 2 denoting the two-dimensional hyperbolic space).
we study the motion of a superparticle in the near-horizon black hole background and
analyze the associated conformal mechanics model. the isometries of the theory give rise
to two copies of the virasoro algebra, in the angular sector and in the radial-time sector
of the superparticle action respectively. focusing on the latter we show that the corre-
sponding hamiltonian can be written in the most general scale-invariant form, namely

h =

p2

2f (u)

,

(1.1)

where q, p are the canonical conjugate variables and f is an arbitrary function of u = pq.
the virasoro symmetry, which exists for any system with scale-invariant hamiltonian of
one dynamical variable [6], is only a subalgebra of a larger symmetry algebra, namely
the algebra of certain volume-preserving dieomorphisms.
it is interesting to observe
that the same symmetry algebra was found in string theories with two-dimensional target
space [7]. in particular we discuss a w subalgebra of area-preserving dieomorphisms.
this symmetry occurs due to the fact that one can nd a canonical transformation which
reduces the scale-invariant hamiltonian of one dynamical variable to that of a free particle.
then the generators of w act as symplectic dieomorphisms preserving the two-form
 = dpdqdhdt. we nd that the algebra admits one central extension (since the rst
betti number of the phase space is b1 = 1). for this general class of models we show that
in a natural way a virasoro subalgebra of w can be associated to the virasoro algebra
of the asymptotic symmetries of ads2 [8]. in this way the quantum-mechanical system
explicitly realizes the asymptotic ads2 symmetries. the connection between gravity on
ads2 and conformal eld theory in 0+1 dimensions can be regarded as an example of
the ads2/cf t1 correspondence [1, 8, 9, 10]. on the gravity (bulk) side, the virasoro
algebra is generated by spacetime dieomorphisms preserving the asymptotic form of the
metric. in the theory living on the boundary of ads2, these virasoro generators translate
into generators of dieomorphisms in the particle phase space. for all black holes whose
near-horizon metric contains an ads2 factor, a central charge appears in this virasoro
algebra. finally the above mentioned canonical transformation allows us to construct
models of superconformal mechanics exhibiting the symmetries of n = 1 and n = 2

superextensions of w.

the remainder of this paper is organized as follows:

in section 2 we present the model and the bps interpolating soliton solutions. we analyze
their near-horizon limit and their supersymmetry properties. furthermore, the isometry
superalgebras of the soliton and its near-horizon limit are derived. in section 3 the motion
of a particle near the horizon of the solitonic black hole is studied and compared with
conformal mechanics. the symmetries of conformal mechanics are studied in detail in
section 4. in section 5 we show that the asymptotic symmetries of the bulk theory living
on ads2 are in direct correspondence with the symmetries of the conformal theory living
on the boundary. the supersymmetric extensions are presented in section 6. finally our
results are summarized and discussed.

2 interpolating solitons in n = 2, d = 4 gauged su-

pergravity

let us rst briey review the gauged version of n = 2, d = 4 supergravity [4, 5]. in
this theory, the rigid so(2) symmetry rotating the two independent majorana supersym-
metries present in the ungauged theory, is made local by the introduction of a minimal
gauge coupling between the graviphoton and the gravitinos. local supersymmetry then
requires a negative cosmological constant and a gravitino mass term. the theory has four
bosonic and four fermionic degrees of freedom; it describes a graviton v 
 , two majorana
gravitinos i
 + i2
,
and a maxwell gauge eld a, minimally coupled to the gravitinos, with coupling constant
g. the bosonic part of the lagrangian is [4, 5]

 (i = 1, 2), which we combine into a single complex spinor  = 1

(2.1)

where r is the scalar curvature, f = a  a is the gauge eld strength and the
cosmological constant is  = 3g2. we look for solutions of the eld equations from (2.1),
with a product metric

ds2 = f (r)dt2  f (r)1dr2  k 2d2,

(2.2)

where k is constant, and d2 is a metric of curvature k = 0,1 on a two-dimensional
manifold . for the gauge eld a we make the ansatz

k 2 r dt + qm cos d

k 2 r dt + qmd

k = 1
k = 0

thus  must be dieomorphic to the hyperbolic space h 2 or to a quotient thereof. with-
out loss of generality setting k = 1 we obtain

a short comment on the supersymmetry conditions on the charges is in order. usually
one has electromagnetic duality invariance, i.e. electric and magnetic charges enter into
the bps conditions in a symmetric way. in our case however, due to the minimal coupling
of the graviphoton to the gravitino, this duality invariance is broken. the bosonic sector
remains duality invariant upon gauging, but the killing spinor equation does not, since
the gauge potential a appears in (2.10). a similar nonsymmetric appearance of electric
and magnetic charges in the bps conditions was found for black holes in diverse gauged
supergravity theories [11, 12, 13, 14].

let us now turn back to the question of how many supersymmetries are preserved by
our solution. in general, the integrability conditions are necessary, but not sucient to
guarantee the existence of killing spinors. solving explicitly the killing spinor equations,
we nd the solution

(, ) = "(1  1i) + (40i +

1


)(1 + 1i)# p0,

where 0 denotes a constant spinor and

p 

1
2

(1  i23)

(2.15)

(2.16)

is a projection operator . the  sign corresponds to the sign of the magnetic charge
qm = 1/(2g). we choose the + sign for deniteness. the appearance of the projector
p+ explicitly shows that half of the n = 2 supersymmetries are broken; the dimension of
the solution space is reduced from four to two (complex) dimensions.
in order to determine the residual symmetry superalgebra of the above supergravity
congurations we make use of a technique described in [15, 16] (cf. also [18]). it is based
on the fact that, up to purely bosonic factors, the isometry superalgebra is determined
by the killing spinors, just as the bosonic symmetry algebra is determined by the killing
vectors. to see this, one rst observes that, given two killing spinors  and , the bilinear
 is a killing vector. now for every killing vector  or -spinor , one can nd bosonic
and fermionic charges qb(), qf (), which are dened in terms of currents associated to
uctuations around a given supergravity background conguration. in [15] it was shown
that

{qf (), qf ()} = qb(),

(2.17)

which means that the determination of the linear combination  of killing vectors
is equivalent to the determination of the linear combination of bosonic charges appearing
in the anticommutator of any pair of fermionic charges. it is surely possible that there
exist additional bosonic symmetries that are not found in the way described above. in
that case, the isometry superalgebra is a direct sum of the superalgebra determined by
the above method, and a purely bosonic part. below, we will encounter such a case.
we dene

2(1  i1) is an additional projector that commutes with p+. using the , we can

(, ) = 2 + 2(40i +

)+ =  + +.

(2.19)

now the killing vectors ++, +,  can be expressed in terms of these killing spinors
as ++ = ++, etc. in this way we obtain

++ = 32g(+0+),

+ = 8ig(+)0,

 = 2g(0)+,

(2.20)

where

162 )  2 ,

+ =  ,
0 =   + 

are the killing vectors of ads2, satisfying the so(2, 1) algebra

[+, ] = 20,
[0, ] = .

(2.21)

(2.22)

we see that the anticommutator of two supercharges contains only the so(2, 1) gener-
ators of ads2; the additional bosonic so(2, 1) symmetries of hyperbolic space h 2 are
not obtained by the above method. this means that the isometry superalgebra of this
ads2  h 2 background is given by a direct sum of an appropriate superextension of
so(2, 1) = su(1, 1), and a bosonic part so(2, 1) = su(1, 1). in our case, we thus obtain
osp(2|2)  so(2, 1) = su(1, 1|1)  su(1, 1) for the residual superalgebra.
finally we want to exhibit a bps solitonic object which interpolates between the
above n = 1 supersymmetric ads2  h 2 solution and the maximally supersymmetric
ads4 spacetime. in fact such a soliton has been found in [11]: it represents an extremal
black hole with metric

(2.23)

and gauge eld

a = qm cosh d,

(2.24)
the spacetime with metric (2.23) has an event horizon at r = r+ = 1/(g2). introducing
the new coordinates  = g(r  r+),  = gt, one veries that the near-horizon limit of
(2.23) is indeed the metric in (2.14). on the other hand, for large r, (2.23) gives

qm =

ds2 = (1 + r2g2)dt2  (1 + r2g2)1dr2  r2(d2 + sinh2 d2),

(2.25)

which is simply ads4 seen by an accelerated observer [19]. the killing spinors for the
conguration (2.23), (2.24) have been determined in [11]

(r) =  rg

(1  i1)p+0.

(2.26)

here 0 is subject to a double projection, which reduces the complex dimension of the
solution space from four to one. near the horizon, where the black hole metric approaches
the one in (2.14), we have a supersymmetry enhancement resulting in a doubling of the
killing spinors. using the same technique as above, one nds for the black hole a residual
superalgebra s(2)  su(1, 1), where s(2) denotes the superalgebra introduced by witten
to formulate supersymmetric quantum mechanics [20].

3 particle motion near the horizon

in this section we study the motion of a particle with mass m and magnetic charge q in
the near-horizon regime of the extremal bps black holes discussed above and nd that it
is governed by a model of conformal mechanics [21, 22]1.

we consider the ads2  h 2 solution of gauged n = 2, d = 4 supergravity: the
metric is given in (2.14), and the gauge eld is a = qm cosh d, with magnetic charge
qm = 1/(2g). dening new coordinates

(3.7)

moreover we have the on-shell relation h = m2 where m is the mass of the particle. thus
we can identify h =  with the hamiltonian of the magnetic particle (m, q),

(3.8)

in particular, if we impose (3.7), h becomes the hamiltonian for a particle in one dimen-
sion, being x and x the conjugate variables. dening

u = xx,

p = x,

and

f (u) =

the reduced hamiltonian becomes

,

h =

2f (u)

.

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

thus we have obtained a conformal theory in 0 + 1 dimensions. the generators of the
conformal algebra so(2, 1) are

d =

h =

2f (u)

,

k =

(3.12)

where d is the generator of dilatations and k the generator of proper conformal trans-
formations. they satisfy the poisson bracket algebra

[d, h]p b = h,

[d, k]p b = k,

[h, k]p b = 2d.

(3.13)

a copy of this algebra is obtained by considering the isometries on the hyperbolic plane
h 2. in fact from (3.7) we have

 =

where

v = zz,

correspondingly we introduce

(v) = 2g2v2 q + c2  g2v2

h =  =

which again satisfy the so(2, 1) algebra

h h, kip b

= 2 d.

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

the generators in (3.12) and the ones in (3.16) commute and give rise to the so(2, 1) 
so(2, 1) algebra. in the same way as in [6], this symmetry can be extended to two copies
of the virasoro algebra, where the generators are given by

ln = 
ln =

x1+np1nf n,

z1+n1n

z n.

(3.18)

now we go back to the hamiltonian (3.11) and discuss its symmetries in detail; in par-
ticular we will see where the above virasoro symmetry comes from.

4 symmetries of conformal mechanics

the hamiltonian in (3.11) describes the most general scale-invariant system of one dy-
namical variable q and canonical conjugate momentum p [6], f denoting an arbitrary
function of u = qp.

for example, hamiltonians of this type where shown to govern the dynamics of a par-
ticle in the near-horizon region of an extremal reissner-nordstrom black hole [21]. also,
the conformal mechanics model of de alfaro, fubini and furlan [29], with hamiltonian

h =

p2

+

g
2q2 ,

8

(4.1)

where g is a dimensionless coupling constant, can be recovered from (3.11) by setting

f (u) =

1

1 + gu2 .

(4.2)

in general one can show [6] that such theories exhibit a virasoro symmetry with

generators

obeying

ln = 

i
2

q1+np1nf n,

[ln, lm]p b = i(m  n)lm+n.

(4.3)

(4.4)

in particular the so(2, 1) subalgebra (the conformal algebra in 0+1 dimensions) is gener-
ated by

il1 = h,

il0 = d,

il1 = k,

(4.5)

with h, d and k as in (3.12). let us now examine in more detail why this virasoro
symmetry arises, and how it generalizes to w. we consider the action of a particle in
0+1 dimensions,

(4.6)

(4.7)

 being the one-form

s = z dt(p q  h(p, q)) = z ,

 = p dq  h dt.

a symmetry transformation for the action in (4.6) must leave invariant the two-form
 = d = dp  dq  dh  dt [7]. in order to determine these symmetries explicitly, rst
we perform the canonical transformation

q = qqf ,

p =

p
f

.

in terms of the new variables the hamiltonian becomes

h = h =

p2
2

,

showing that classically the system is equivalent to a free particle. setting

the two-form  reduces to

y = p,

x = q  pt,

 = dy  dx.

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)

(4.11)

therefore the symmetries of the system are the dieomorphisms which preserve the sym-
plectic two-form (4.11). they are generated by vector elds (cf. [30])

 = aa = ab(b(y, x) + b)a + h(y, x, t)t

=


y

x 


x

y + yx  xy + ht,

(4.12)

9

where (y, x) and h(y, x, t) are arbitrary functions, and   h 1(m, r), m denoting the
(x, y) phase space. this symmetry algebra is isomorphic to that of the matrix model
with the standard inverted harmonic oscillator hamiltonian [7]. in order to establish a
correspondence with the symmetries arising in string theories with two-dimensional target
space, one should instead consider only time-independent functions h [7], i. e. h = h(y, x).
in this case, the transformations generated by (4.12) preserve  as well as the volume
form

 = dy  dx  dt.

(4.13)

for h = 0, the vector elds (4.12) generate the algebra w of area-preserving (symplectic)
dieomorphisms [30] on which we will concentrate in the following3. explicitly one can
choose as a basis of generators

m = yl+1xl+m+1 =   p

(4.17)

the spectrum of the hamiltonian in (3.11) is continuous and bounded from below (e > 0),
the ground state at e = 0 being non-normalizable.4. a way to cure this infrared problem
is to study the time evolution of the system by means of a compact operator [29] (which
has a discrete set of normalizable eigenfunctions)

r =

1

2 (cid:18)ah +

1
a

k(cid:19) ,

where a denotes an infrared cuto. to be more specic we choose

k = q2f /2.

(4.18)

(4.19)

3note that, in order for w to admit central extensions, the rst cohomology group h 1(m ) (m
denoting (x, y) phase space) must be non-trivial. there exist b1 independent central extensions, where
b1 is the rst betti number of m [30].

4we observe that the functions f (u) in (3.10) and in (4.2) as well as the one of the model in [21] all

satisfy the asymptotic behaviour in (4.17).

10

though scale and translational invariance are broken by this procedure, the new model
admits a symmetry algebra isomorphic to so(2, 1) [29]. in fact the new system is again
invariant under the algebra w. let us consider r, with h given by (3.11) and k as in
(4.19). now we have

which, by means of the (canonical) transformation

(4.21)

(4.22)

which satisfy (4.15). as above, the vl

(4.24)

in contrast to the generators in (4.3) we have now lm = l and l0 = r, which means
that l0 plays the role of the hamiltonian.

let us nally discuss the question of central charges. since the virasoro symmetry of
this model stems from the larger symmetry algebra of area-preserving dieomorphisms,
central extensions might be possible. as already observed, in order to have central exten-
sions, the rst betti number b1 of the manifold on which these dieomorphisms act, must
be nonzero. now we show that this is indeed the case. to this end we go back to the
hamiltonian r in (4.18) with h and k given in (3.11) and (4.19) respectively. first of
all we note that the w generators (4.23) are singular at q = 0 for m suciently negative.
in order to dene smooth dieomorphisms we perform a canonical transformation

 = 2 arctan

p =

this yields the transformed hamiltonian

r = r = p,

(4.25)

so classically the system is equivalent to a relativistic particle on the circle. (note that
0    2, in order to have q  0). the two-form  becomes

(4.27)
where  =   t. thus, for constant t, the dieomorphisms preserving  are the area-
preserving dieomorphisms sdi(s 1  r) on the cylinder. this manifold has b1 = 1,
therefore sdi(s 1  r) admits exactly one central extension [30].

5 conformal mechanics and bulk asymptotic symme-

tries

in this section we show that the virasoro generators (4.24) of the infrared-regularized
model with hamiltonian r given by (4.18) can be associated in a natural way to the
generators of the asymptotic symmetries of ads2 [8].

let us rst consider the ads2 metric with coordinates as in (3.2)

ds2 =

1
g4q4 dt2 

1
g2q2 dq2.

then the asymptotic symmetries of ads2 determined in [8] become

lm = eimt("1 

m2g2q4

8

+ o(q8)# t +(cid:20) im

2

q + o(q2)(cid:21) q) .

(5.1)

(5.2)

they generate the dieomorphisms which preserve the asymptotic form5 of the ads2
metric. in [8], the generators (5.2) have been determined by imposing certain boundary
conditions on the metric. these boundary conditions must be weak enough in order
to allow for a larger symmetry algebra than so(2, 1), but strong enough to ensure the
possibility to dene the associated conserved charges [8]. it is easy to show that the bulk
generators (5.2) satisfy the virasoro algebra

they can be rewritten as

[lm, lk] = i(m  k)lm+k.

lm = eimt(cid:26)(m2  1)l0 +

m
2

(m + 1)eitl1 +

m
2

(m  1)eitl1(cid:27)

(5.3)

(5.4)

in order to establish the correspondence with the symmetries of our conformal mechanics
model we associate the generators l0, l1 with the phase-space functions given in (4.24)

l0  l0 = r,
l1  l1 = eit(r 

q2f
2a 

i
2

qp) .

in this way, using (5.5) in (5.4), we nd

lm  lm = eimt(ap2

4f

+

q2f
4a 

m2

q2f 

im

qp) .

(5.5)

(5.6)

at this point it is trivial to check that, when expanded in a laurent series in q near the
boundary q = 0, the lm in (5.6) obtained through the above correspondence and the lm

5note that the boundary is at q = 0.

of the conformal mechanics given in (4.24) do agree up to the order q6 inclusive. the
ir-regularized model realizes explicitly the asymptotic symmetries of ads2.

the central extension of the algebra is easily obtained through a comparison with the
work in ref. [8]. there the asymptotic symmetries of ads2 were realized canonically in the
hamiltonian formulation of the jackiw-teitelboim (jt) model. in this way, the authors
of [8] found a central charge, which is is expressed in terms of the dilaton eld evaluated
at the black hole horizon.
in our case, in order to identify the dilaton we proceed as
follows: we consider static solutions of the form

ds2 = hij(r, t)dxidxj  2(r, t)ij dxidxj ,
a = at(r)dt + a()d,

(5.7)

where i, j = t, r; i, j = , , and ij denotes the metric on a two-dimensional space of
constant curvature k. from gauss theorem we have

ftr = qe

h

,

f = qm,

 = qdet ij = 


sin 
k = 1,

k = 0,
sinh  k = 1.

(5.8)

(5.9)

where

the ansatz for the metric and the electromagnetic eld strength can be used in the
lagrangian (2.1) of n = 2 gauged supergravity. the corresponding equations of motion
give rise to an eective two-dimensional dilatonic theory of gravity, being hij the metric
and  the dilaton eld. the action becomes

s = z dx dth(cid:20)

near the horizon r = r+, where w (r) = 0, the metric contains an ads2 factor if the black
hole is extremal. this leads to the requirement

w (r+) = 2v (r+),

(5.14)

where v (r) is the dilaton potential (5.11). this means that at the horizon, the dilaton
potential (5.11) vanishes. near the horizon, we expand

2(r) = (r+ + )2  r2

+ + 2r+,

  0,

(5.15)

 = 0 denoting the horizon position. we further have

2

r+! ()2,
v ()  v ()  v (r+).

(5.16)

putting the dilaton on-shell ( = r  r+), neglecting a gauss-bonnet term, and dening

we arrive at the jt model with action

where

s = z dx dth (r + 22),

2 =

w (r+) =

v (r+)

.

(5.17)

(5.18)

(5.19)

at this point the correspondence with the theory in ref. [8] is established in a straightfor-
ward manner. in complete agreement with the result in [8] we nd that for all the various
superconformal particle models the central charge is given by

c = 24vuut

r3
+

v (r+)

.

in particular, for the interpolating soliton (2.23), (2.24), one gets

c =

12
g22

.

(5.20)

(5.21)

we emphasize that the results presented so far are quite general: they are valid for
any conformal quantum mechanics describing the motion of a particle in a black hole
conguration that in the near-horizon region is given by ads2  2 where 2 is a two-
dimensional manifold with constant curvature.

6 superextensions

we now ask whether one can nd generalizations of conformal mechanics which are invari-
ant under superextensions of the w algebra. superconformal mechanics has rst been
studied in [31, 32], where the su(1, 1|1) = osp(2|2) generalization of the dff model was
constructed. the authors of [21] studied the motion of a superparticle in the ads2  s 2
background of an extreme rn black hole in the near-horizon limit. there, an osp(1|2)
superextension of the dff model was considered, which, however, was only possible for
g = 0 in (4.1), if one wants the standard supersymmetry to be linearly realized (cf. also
[17]). this is not surprising, as for g 6= 0 there is no classical solution of zero energy,
so there can be no ground state annihilated by the supercharge q [21]. below we shall
construct models of n = 1 or n = 2 superconformal mechanics in which both the stan-
dard supersymmetry and the conformal supersymmetry are nonlinearly realized. these
models will turn out to admit not only the osp(1|2) or osp(2|2) symmetry algebras, but
the entire n = 1 or n = 2 superextensions of w.
let us rst consider the n = 1 case. we start from the bosonic hamiltonian (3.11),
which, after the canonical transformation (4.8) reduces to (4.9), i. e. to the hamiltonian
of a free particle. for a free particle, however, an n = 1 superextension can easily be
found, the action is given by

s = z dt (

1
2

q2 +

 ),

i
2

(6.1)

where  is an anticommuting world line eld. performing now the inverse of the canonical
transformation (4.8), the action (6.1) goes over in

s = z dt (p q 

p2
2f

+

i
2

 )

(6.2)

plus a surface term, which we can drop. we are thus led to propose (6.2) as n = 1
superparticle action, which generalizes the dff model for g 6= 0. in the following we will
show that the symmetry algebra admitted by (6.2) is indeed the n = 1 superextension
of w. similar to the bosonic case, (6.2) can be written as

where

s = z ,

 = p dq +

i

 d  h dt,

so the two-form  = d considered in section 4 reads

 = dp  dq  dh  dt +

ation of a superfunction f (y, x, , t) under a symplectic superdieomorphism generated
by  in (6.7), is given by

(6.15)
l denoting the lie derivative along . taking  = q and h = 0 in (6.7), where  is
constant and anticommuting, and q was dened in (6.14), one gets

similar relations hold for  = s, i. e. for the variations under conformal supersymmetry

realized.

7 conclusions

the initial aim of our work was the study of the (super)particle dynamics in a black hole
background solution of n = 2 gauged supergravity in d = 4 dimensions. we have found
that such a system is described by a quantum mechanical model whose symmetry group

18

is generated by a couple of conformal algebras, one in the angular sector and one in the
time-radial sector. in fact we have shown that the relevant part of the action reduces to a
universal scale invariant form. the isometries of the theory are associated to the virasoro
generators which are obtained from the generators of the conformal group so(2, 1) in 0 + 1
dimensions.

naively this algebra has vanishing central charge [6]. on the other hand a one-to-one
correspondence can be established between the so(2, 1) group of conformal mechanics and
the isometries of ads2. in addition in ref.
[8] it had been proven that the asymptotic
symmetries of ads2 exhibit a non vanishing central charge. to resolve this puzzle we
have shown that the conformal mechanical model does admit a central extension. the
crucial observation has been the fact that the conformal virasoro algebra appears as a
subalgebra of a w algebra with b1 = 1, i.e. with exactly one possible central extension.
we have computed the central charge and found complete agreement with the result in
ads2. thus our system oers an explicit realization of the ads2/cf t1 correspondence.
