we compute the o(3) corrections to the ads5 black hole metric in type iib string
theory. contrary to previous work in this direction we keep the black hole radius nite.
thus the topology of the boundary is s3  s1. we nd the corrections to the free energy
and the critical temperature of the phase transition.

the study of large n gauge theories received in the last year new input from malda-

cenas conjecture that type iib superstring theory on asymptotically ads - backgrounds

is dual to the strong coupling limit of large n gauge theories [1]. originally the conjecture
states that type iib string theory on ads5  s5 is dual to n = 4 supersymmetric gauge
theory with gauge group su (n ) in the limit of large n and strong t hooft coupling
 = g2
y m n . the string loop expansion corresponds to the 1/n expansion of the gauge
theory and the sigma-model  expansion to the expansion in the t hooft coupling. de-
noting the scale of the ads5  s5 geometry by , the ads/cft dictionary says 4
2 = 
and gstring = 4g2
y m . the gauge theory is thought to live on the conformal boundary of
the ads space. further specication of the conjecture has been achieved in [2], in partic-

ular it was shown how to calculate correlation functions in the boundary conformal eld

theory. the conjecture was very soon generalized by witten to gauge theories at nite

temperature [3]. he observed that replacing the ads space by the ads schwarzschild
metric should correspond to have the gauge theory at nite temperature on s3. taking
the scaling limit of a large black hole one can make the radius of the three sphere in-

nite. the metric obtained in this way coincides with the near horizon limit of the near

extremal threebrane solution [4]. the relation between the near extremal threebrane solu-

tion and gauge theories at nite temperature has been studied already earlier by klebanov

et al.[5]. in particular they found that the bekenstein-hawking entropy of the threebrane
solution reproduces the entropy of the n = 4 gauge theory up to a relative factor of 3
4 .
it is now understood that this dierence stems from the fact, that the calculation in the

gauge theory is done at vanishing coupling, whereas the string calculation is relevant to

the regime of innite coupling (see the recent review by klebanov [6]).
in [7] the au-
thors calculated the o(3) correction to the entropy stemming from the r4 term in the
eective action of type iib strings1. this calculation has actually a somewhat involved
history. it was rst done using only the ve dimensional limit of the ads schwarzschild
metric which is asymptotic to s1  r3 in two dierent ways. first the authors plugged
in the uncorrected expression for the metric in the r4 term. in a second step they also
calculated the corrections to the metric. quite surprisingly the results for the free energy

turned out to agree.
it was then pointed out in [9] that one actually has to consider
the whole ten dimensional metric including the s5 factor. however, the thermodynamic
quantities turned out to be unchanged in comparison to the purely ve dimensional cal-

culation. for the latter fact an explanation has been oered in an appendix to [7]. using

1 corrections stemming from these terms have rst been conisered in context of the ads/cft

correspondence in [8].

1

the ads/cft dictionary this correction translates into the next to leading order term in
a strong coupling expansion in 1
 at innite n . on general grounds one expects for the
entropy s = 22
3 n 2v3t 3f (). the strong coupling expansion corresponding to the string
theory regime gives then f () = 3
32 (3)(2)3/2 +   . a recent eld theory two loop
calculation gives the expansion around  = 0 as f () = 1  3

22  +    [10].

let us turn now to the ads schwarzschild black hole which asymptotically approaches

4 + 45

s3  s1. the ten dimensional metric used as iib background is given by

we have chosen here the analog of the parameterization as in the appendix of [7], which
turns out to be very convenient for calculating the string corrections. the o( 0) expres-
sion for the functions a(r), b(r) and c(r) are

a(r) = 2 log(

c(r) = 0.

here r0 is a parameter determining the mass of the black hole. the thermodynamical
properties of the four dimensional ads schwarzschild black hole have been investigated

some years ago by hawking and page [11]. for the ve dimensional case at hand things

are completely parallel. we summarize the relevant facts. the metric does not have a
conical singularity if  is compactied on a circle of radius  = 2r+2
++2 . this denes the
hawking temperature t = 1
 and r+ is the largest root of r22 + r4 + r4
0 = 0. for a given
temperature there are two solutions

the smaller black hole is however unstable against decay into the larger one. the black hole
2
solution exists only down to a minimal temperature tmin =
 . the action is calculated
by subtracting the value with r0 = 0 which corresponds to empty anti-de-sitter space.
it changes sign at r+ =  (tc = 3
2 ) thereby signalling a phase transition. for r+  
the black hole is unstable against tunneling into pure ads space. witten argued that

this behavior corresponds to a large n high/low temperature phase transition in the gauge

theory on the boundary [3]. at low temperature the theory is described by ads-space. the

2

free energy is of order one indicating a conning phase. at high temperature the ads black
hole geometry is thermodynamically favored. the free energy is of order n 2 indicating a
deconning phase of the gauge theory. this high/low temperature phase transition occurs
only when the gauge theory lives on s3. actually, because of the conformal symmetry
of the n = 4 gauge theory the behavior depends only on the dimensionless quantity 
 ,
measuring the ratio of the radius of the circle to the radius of the three sphere. we are
interested in calculating the o(3) corrections to the relevant thermodynamical quantities.
this question has been addressed before in [12]. there the authors did not consider
corrections to the geometry but just plugged in the uncorrected metric into the r4 term.
this is a somewhat oversimplied procedure since it ignores the corrections to the geometry.
it seems therefore worth to reconsider the problem taking into account also the o(3)
corrections to the metric. for notational convenience we will set the ads scale  = 1, it
can be reintroduced easily by dimensional analysis.

for the metric at o(0) we have w = 180r8
r16 . the action for iib ve form eld should
be understood in the sense that one rst varies the action and then implements the self-
duality condition at the level of the equation of motion. such a procedure is convenient
for purposes of dimensional reduction. in particular using the ansatz (1) we obtain the
one dimensional action

as already in the r3 case the w-contribution is to long to be displayed here (approx. 1.5

by the total derivative term solely.

this expression vanishes at the horizon r+. at innity it vanishes also provided c(r) goes
to zero at least as fast as 1

despite much eort we did not nd a closed solution for c1. however, as we just saw, this
eld does not contribute to the action if it vanishes fast enough at innity. for very large
r the dierential equation for c1 becomes

(r5c1)  32r3c1 = 0 .

(10)

from this we nd c1(r)  c1
r8 + c2r4. as boundary condition we demand that the metric
should still be asymptotically ads and thus c2 = 0. this shows that c1(r) vanishes indeed
fast enough and does not contribute to the action. the solutions for the other equations
are

we nally want to express the free energy as function of the temperature. to do this we
need to invert (12). we write r+ = f0(t ) + f1(t ) where f0(t ) is given by the larger
value in (3) and f1(t ) turns out as

f1(t ) =

the entropy is now given by s =  f
t and coincides exactly with the expression given in
[12]. it is very interesting that a careful calculation taking into account also the corrections

to the metric gives the same results as just plugging in the uncorrected metric into the
r4 term. noting that the corrections are rather more complicated that in the at case
considered in [7] and [9] this seems even more a miracle. so the features of the geometry
at o(3) are not relevant to its thermodynamics at this order. it would be interesting to
have a better physical understanding of this property. another interesting point would be

to compare these expressions with a two loop calculation in eld theory.
