abstract

we suggest that proper variables for the description of non-abelian theories
are those gauge invariant ones which keep the invariance of the winding
number functional with respect to topologically nontrivial (large) gauge
transformations. we present a model for these variables using the zero mode
of the gauss law constraint and investigate their physical consequences for
hadron spectrum and connement on the level of the generating functional
for two-color qcd.

i. introduction

the identication of physical degrees of freedom in non-abelian gauge theories is a
crucial point for understanding the physical phenomena hidden in their structure. ac-
cording to dirac [1], the principle of local gauge invariance has to be established not only
on the level of the lagrangian, but also on the level of the variables used in the formula-
tion of the gauge theory, since we can observe only gauge-invariant quantities. dirac has
obtained the unconstrained form of qed in terms of gauge invariant variables for qed [1]
as functionals of the initial gauge elds by explicitly resolving the gauss law constraint.
the resulting unconstrained formulation of qed coincides with the one obtained in the
coulomb gauge [2] with the physical phenomena of electrostatics, dressed electrons, and
two transverse photon degrees of freedom. the relativistic covariance of this formulation
of qed has been proven by zumino [3] on the level of the algebra of generators of the
poincare group.

the dirac denition of the gauge-invariant variables can be treated also as a change
of variables to construct the generating functional of the green functions in any gauges
including the lorentz invariant ones. the invariance of the corresponding green functions
under a change of variables (which generates the ward-taylor-slavnov identities [4]) is
guaranteed by the dirac factors in source terms, which restore the coulomb gauge feyn-
man rules in any lorentz invariant gauge. so, the coulomb interaction and electrostatics
are consequences of the identication of the physical degrees of freedom which correspond
to an explicit solution of the gauss law, but not primarily to the choice of the gauge.
for example, if one would omit the dirac factors in for the source terms in relativistically
invariant lorentz gauge formulations of qed, one would get the wick-cutkosky bound
states formed by gauge propagators with light-cone singularities with a spectrum dier-
ent 1 from the observed one which corresponds to the instantaneous coulomb interaction.
thus, the dirac variables in qed are gauge-invariant, lorentz covariant, and bear direct
relation to measurable quantities.

the attempts to obtain the non-abelian generalization of the dirac gauge invari-
ant variables [610] meet the diculties of the nontrivial topological structure of gauge
transformations which are classied as small and large ones in accordance with their
homotopy group, e.g. (3)(su(2)) = z [11,12] for the example of two-color qcd con-
sidered below. the quantization of the fermion sector of the theory leads to anomalies
[13] and to the topological winding number functional of the gauge elds which plays
an important role in the description of physical phenomena connected with the ua(1)
anomaly [1418]. it is, however, not invariant with respect to large gauge transformations
and the problem arises: is it possible to construct topological gauge invariant variables
which leave the winding number invariant under large gauge transformations?

1one of the authors (v.p.) thanks w. kummer who pointed out that in ref. [5] the dif-
ference between the coulomb atom and the wick-cutkosky bound states in qed has been
demonstrated.

in the present paper, we study the physical consequences of the nontrivial topology of
non-abelian gauge elds using topological dirac variables. the resulting representation
of the qcd generating functional is dened by the zero modes of the gauss law constraint
[68] in the class of functions of large gauge transformations, which disappear at spatial
innity but have nonzero surface integrals.

the paper is organized as follows. section 2 reviews the introduction of ordinary dirac
variables for non-abelian theories using the example of the suc(2) yang-mills theory. in
section 3, we give the denition of topological dirac variables which are constructed
by including a zero mode of the gauss law constraint. we derive an equation for the
topological invariance of non-perturbative elds in the class of functions corresponding
to large gauge transformations.
in section 4, we show that the wu-yang monopole
is a solution of this equation and use it to obtain the electric eld of the -vacuum,
the instantaneous interaction for qcd, and equations for quasiparticle excitations.
in
section 5, the generating functional for green functions is constructed and a discussion
of the problems of hadronization and connement is given. the conclusions are presented
in section 6.

ii. dirac variables in non-abelian theories

we consider two-color qcd, i.e. suc(2) yang-mills theory coupled to fermionic elds

(quarks), with the action functional

the action (2.1) is invariant with respect to arbitrary gauge transformations u(t, x)

u := u(t, x) ,

au

i := u(t, x)(cid:16) ai + i(cid:17) u1(t, x) .

3

(2.5)

(2.6)

in order to eliminate unphysical degrees of freedom, we introduce the non-abelian gener-
alization of the dirac variables [1] according to [6]

d[, a] := u[a] ,

where u[a] is a solution of the linear dierential equation

ad

 [a] := u[a](cid:16) a + (cid:17) u 1[a] ,

u[a] (a0[a] + 0) u 1[a] = 0 ,

and a0[a] is a solution of the gauss equation without the fermion source term

[d2(a)]bcac

0 = [dk(a)]bc0ac

k .

by construction, the matrix u[a] has the transformation property [6]

u[au] = u[a]u1 ,

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

so that the dirac variables ad
tials

i are gauge-invariant functionals of the initial gauge poten-

ad[au] = ad[a] ,

d[u, au] = d[, a] ,

which satisfy the identity

dab

i (ad)0(ad

i )b  0 .

(2.12)

(2.13)

the solution of the system of linear dierential equations (2.9), (2.10) can be written in
the form of the time ordered exponential

u(t, ~x; t0) = v(~x)t exp(cid:18)z t

t0

dta0(t, ~x)(cid:19) .

(2.14)

the gauge-invariant dirac variables ad as solutions of the dierential equation (2.9) are
dened for the initial values

u(t, ~x) |t=t0= v(~x) .

(2.15)

these values dene the remaining group of stationary gauge transformations of the
dirac variables. the group of the stationary gauge transformations v(~x) in the three-
dimensional coordinate space is topologically nontrivial and represents the group of three-
dimensional paths lying on the three-dimensional space of the suc(2)-manifold with the
homotopy group (3)(suc(2)) = z. the whole group of the stationary gauge transforma-
tions is split into topological classes marked by the degree of the map (i.e. the integer
number n) which counts how many times a three-dimensional path turns around the
su(2)-manifold when the coordinate xi runs over the space where it is dened. the

4

stationary transformations vn(~x) with n = 0 are called the small ones; and those with
n 6= 0

the large ones.

is the topological winding number functional of the gauge elds. this functional plays an
important role for the description of observable phenomena in hadronic physics connected
with the violation of the axial ua(1) symmetry and, in particular, with the occurrence of
the    mass dierence [1418]. the functional x[a] is not invariant with respect to
large gauge transformations (2.16) [11] (see defs. (3.33), (3.36) in [12]):

x[a(n)] = x[a] + n [b, n] ,

where

n [b, n] =

(2.21)

both the large transformations and asymptotic eld b(x) are given in the electrostatic-
type class of the functions which disappear at spatial innity but have nonvanishing
surface integrals in eq. (2.20).

in the context of the dirac invariant description of the quantum theory the question
appears: is it possible to construct topological non-abelian variables as functionals of
the dirac ones at [ad], so that the winding number (2.18) becomes invariant also with
respect to the large gauge transformations, i.e.

x[at [ad(n)

]] = x[at [ad]]

(2.22)

for n 6= 0 ? the answer to this question is the subject of the present paper and will be
given in the next section.

iii. topologically invariant dirac variables

a. zero mode of the gauss constraint

our idea is to construct such topological variables at for which the winding number
(2.22) converts into a zero mode of the gauss constraint [68,20]. the latter, in terms of
the dirac variables (2.7), (2.8), has the form

(d2(ad))ac(ad

0 )c = (jd

0 )a ,

(3.1)

where ja
equation is a sum of the solution c of the homogeneous equation

 a is the fermionic current. a general solution of this inhomogeneous

 = g
2

(cid:16)d2(a)(cid:17)ac

c = 0 ,

(3.2)

i.e. a zero mode of the gauss law constraint, and a partial solution ad
neous one (3.1)

0 of the inhomoge-

the electric eld strength

0 =  + ad
ad
0 .

ea

k = 0(ad

0 )a + dac

k (ad)(ad

0 )c

can also be decomposed into a zero mode part and a perturbative part ec

k ,

ec

k = dcb

k (ad)b + ec
k .

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

then, the initial yang-mills action in (2.1) is a sum of global (g) and local (l) parts

wy m = wg + wl .

(3.6)

the local part coincides with the gauge eld sector of the initial action (2.1) with the
elds a0 replaced by a0, and the global one is

where

wg = z dt (ie + i) ,

ie = z d3x [ eidi(a) + j0] ,

i =

1

2 z d3x (di(a))a(di(a))a .

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

to construct the generating functional in quantum theory [21], we need only the
constraint-shell action, where the (global) zero-mode part converts into a sum of two
surface integrals [8]

6

ie  z d3x i( ei) = i dsi( ei)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)|~x|  

1

i 

4 z d3x (a)2 .

(3.10)

(3.11)

thus, we can restrict ourselves to the electrostatics class of functions of topologically
nontrivial gauge transformations, in the region of the spatial innity. for symplicity, we
suppose that the quasiparticle part disappears, ie = 0, and the dirac eld ad at spatial
innity converts into a stationary one (bi(~x), eq. (2.21)). in this case, the zero mode eld
factorizes into

where a

0(~x) satises the equation

a(t, ~x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)|~x|  

= n0(t)a

0(~x) ,

(d2(b))ca0

a = 0 .

(3.12)

(3.13)

n0 is a zero mode with the dynamics of a free rotator [6] dened by the lagrangian (3.11)

i =

mn
2

n 2

0 ; mn =

1

2 zv

d3x (a

0)2 .

b. the topological dirac variables

we dene the topological variables

at [a] = u [d]( ad + ) u 1[d] ,
dt d(t, ~x)(cid:19) ,

u [d] = t exp(cid:18)z t

t0

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

so that the topological functional (2.18) in terms of these variables depends only on the
zero mode n0:

x[at ] = x[ad] + n (b, n0  x[ad]) = n0 ,

where

n (b, n) =

1

82 z d3xijkt r[i(bjln

k ) 

1
3

(ln

i ln

j ln

k )] ,

and ln
i

is the pure gauge eld

ln

k = u(n)k(u(n))1 ,

u(n) = lim

|~x|  

u [d] = exp[n(t) 0(~x)] .

7

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)
(3.20)

in order to fulll the constraint (3.17), it is sucient to nd the magnetostatic eld bi(~x)
for which

n (b, n) = n .

(3.21)

this self-consistency condition for the invariance of the topological functional (3.18)
is a necessary and sucient condition for the topological invariance of the dirac vari-
ables (3.15), (3.16) constructed above.

let us solve the constraint (3.21) for the class of functions of topologically nontriv-
f () = 1

ial gauge transformations [11,12] with the boundary conditions f (0) = 0,
supposing that the corresponding zero mode solution 0(~x) has the form

0(~x) = ina af (r);

r = | ~x . |

in this case, the second part of n (b, n) in eq. (3.18) is equal to [12]

(n 
then, the rst part should be equal to

2

sin(2n)

) .

(3.22)

(3.23)

(

sin(2n)

2

) ,

in order to fulll the condition (3.21) n (b, n) = n. one can be show that this compensa-
tion is fullled for an asymptotic eld b(~x) which has the form of the wu-yang monopole
[22,23], i.e.

ba
i =

1
g

iak

nk()

r

,

nk() =

xllk

r

,

(3.24)

where lk is an orthogonal matrix in color space: nk()nk() = 1 .

the wu-yang monopole and similar solutions of the classical equations are also present
in su(3) theory, if we choose the minimal subgroup su(2) of suc(3) (this means that
the fundamental representation of suc(3) is an irreducible one of this subgroup).

for example, the role of matrices 1, 2, 3 of the minimal subgroup su(2), in suc(3)

theory, is played by (2, 5, 7). in this case,

=bi = g

i 5 + b3
b1
i 2 + b2
2i

i 7

;

ba
i =

aiknk

gr

.

(3.25)

thus, we can reproduce the construction of the topological dirac variables also in the
suc(3) non-abelian theory.

8

iv. physical consequences

a. non-perturbative asymptotic eld

in order to illustrate physical consequences of the topological dirac variables, we

consider the wu-yang monopole more in detail.

the wu-yang monopole satises the classical equation everywhere except for the sin-

gularity at r = 0 with the corresponding magnetic eld

ba

i (b) =

nani
gr2

.

(4.1)

following wu and yang [22], we consider the whole nite space volume, excluding an
-region around the singular point. the size of this small region is chosen so that the
vacuum energy of the monopole solution (3.24)

i (b))2 =

] ,

s =

4

(4.2)

is removed by a nite counter-term in the lagrangian,

l = l 

4
2s

.

the choice 4 = (v )1 leads to volume-independent results. the parameter  of the
ultraviolet cuto is proportional to v 1 and disappears in the innite volume limit

()1 = v 4 ,

(4.3)

where the parameter  has the dimension of energy and determines the average density
of the asymptotic eld b

1

2v z d3xg2(b) =

< sg2(b) >

2

= 4 .

(4.4)

b. -vacuum

for the given regularization there is a solution of the zero mode equation (3.2) in the

form of eq. (3.22)

a =

1
g

na2f (r);

f (r) = 1 


r

,

(4.5)

with the function f (r) which fullls the boundary conditions f () = 0 and f () = 1, in
the considered region of space.

9

in this case, the functional (3.18) does not depend on the parameter of regularization
and can be calculated exactly. as we have seen above, it coincides with the zero mode
variable, n (b, n) = n.

the kinetic term i is equal to

i =

(4v )1 ,

where we took into account eq. (4.3). the zero mode n0 is given in the physical region
0  n0  1, where the endpoints n0 = 0, n0 = 1 are physically equivalent, so that the
phase space of the physical variables has the topology of a cylinder [11,7]. the lagrangian
of the global motion (4.6) describes a free rotator with the momentum spectrum [6]

p0 = n0mn = (2k + ) ,

k = 0, 1, 2, ...,

which follows from the constraint on the wave function

(n0 + 1) = exp(i)(n0).

the corresponding vacuum part of the electric eld in (3.4) does not contain the regular-
ization parameter and reads

ea

i = n0 (di(b))a = (k +


2

)sba
i

,

(4.7)

where ba
i
number k = 0 corresponds to a nonzero electric eld

is the vacuum magnetic eld (4.1). the vacuum state with the minimal wave

(ea

i )min =

i

2

,

(4.8)

i.e. a persistent eld motion around the cylinder. we have obtained a eld theoretical
analogy of the josephson eect: a circular current without sources. coleman [24] was the
rst who guessed an eect similar to (4.8) in qed1+1, but from a classical point of view.
the quantum treatment of this eect was discussed in refs. [7,25].

this duality of the vacuum in the minkowski space (4.7) shows that there can be a
value of the superuid momentum p0 = 2/s for which the vacuum lagrangian vanishes

s = (k +


2

)1  g2 = 2(b2  e2) = 0

without any counterterm discussed before.

10

c. non-abelian generalization of the coulomb potential

we can also calculate the instantaneous interaction which corresponds to the green
function of the gauge eld when perturbations of the vacuum are neglected, see (3.5). in
the presence of the wu-yang monopole the green function satises the equation

where

(d2)ab(~x)gbc(~x, ~y) = ac3(~x  ~y) ,

(d2)ab(~x) = ab 

nanb + ab

r2

+ 2(

na
r

b 

nb
r

a) ,

and na(x) = xa/r; r = |~x| . let us decompose gab into a complete set of orthogonal
vectors in color space

gab(~x, ~y) = [na(x)nb(y)v0(z) + x=1,2

(x)eb
ea

(y)v1(z)];

(z = |~x  ~y|) .

substituting the latter into the rst equation, we get

d2
dz2 vn +

2
z

d
dz

vn 

n
z2 vn = 0 .

the general solution for the last equation is

vn(z) = dnzln

1 + cnzln
2 ;

(n = 0, 1) ,

where dn, cn are constants, and ln
0; i.e.

1 , ln

2 can be found as roots of the equation (ln)2 +lnn =

1 + 1 + 4n

2 = 1 + 1 + 4n

ln

.

;

ln
1 =

it is easy to see that for n = 0 we get the coulomb potential d0 = 1/4, and for n = 1
the golden section potential with
1 + 5

l1
1 = 

2

 1.618 ;

2 = 1 + 5

l1

2

 0.618 ,

which can be used as the potential for the hadronization of two-color qcd.

d. quasiparticle excitations

the presence of the wu-yang monopole bi(~x) does not change the qualitative character
of the excitation spectrum of the perturbation theory, it only mixes the color and spin-
orbital quantum numbers. to demonstrate this fact, let us consider the fundamental
representation with the equation for a fermion in the wu-yang monopole

i00 + j[ij +

1
2r

11

aajlnl] = 0 .

(4.9)

in the two-component form of the fermion eld, (+, ), each component is a 2  2 -
matrix which can be decomposed into a scalar s and a vector vj

 ,

 = s, + vj
,

 ,

j

.

(4.10)

finally, we obtain the following set of equations for the scalar s and vector vj

 amplitudes

(qo + m)si(a +
i(a 

na
r

)s  ijabjvb

(qo + m)va

na
r

)va

 = 0 ,

 = 0 ,

(4.11)

(4.12)

where q0 is an eigenvalue of the i0 - operator. these equations are solved by decomposing
the functions (s, v) w.r.t. orbital momenta. as a result, we obtain a continuous spectrum
of the conventional perturbation theory with a mixing of color and spin and the wave
function asymptotics o(rn) , n > 1.

v. generating functional

a. problems of the covariant coulomb gauge

let us consider dierences between the topological dirac variables at , t and the

conventional variables [26,21] for covariant coulomb gauge

dk(b)ak = 0

(5.1)

on the level of the generating functional of the unitary perturbation theory treating the
asymptotic eld b(~x) as a nonperturbative background. for comparison, it is worth to
repeat the construction of the generating functional given in ref. [21] for the case of an
external eld (here, the wu-yang monopole)

zd[j, , ] = z [dai][dei][d ][d]x(dkek)(dkak)

this construction is based on an explicit solution of the gauss law constraint obtained by
decomposing the electric eld components of the eld strength tensor g0i into transverse
ei and longitudinal gl

0i = dif parts,

g0i = ei  di(b)f ; dk(b)ek = 0 .

here the function f can be determined from the equation [26,21]

(cid:16)(d2)ab + gadcaddcb(cid:17) fb = jb

tot,0;

where d  d(b).

(5.3)

(5.4)

as we have seen above, the wu-yang monopole leads to the instantaneous potential
of hadronization which can form mesonic bound states. in order to describe this bound
state, we can use the bilocal representation of the generating functional in the meson
channel with the external elds (b + a) [27,28]

zh[b, a, c, c] = z [dmh] exp {iwe(mh)  i(gmh(b, a), cc)} ,

where we(mh) is the eective action for the bilocal elds mh

we(m) = 

1

2 (cid:16)m, k1(b, a)m(cid:17)  i tr lngm(b, a) .

(5.5)

(5.6)

with the non-abelian coulomb kernel k(b, a) which depends on the transverse gluon
elds a and the tr-symbol includes the trace over color indices.

this eective action contains the 0 -meson part ( 5.9)

f = 92.4 mev is the pion weak decay constant, nf is the number of avors, and x[a] is
the topological winding number functional (2.18). on the level of conventional transverse
variables [26,21], the problem appears, how to extract the dynamics of the collective
variable x[a] from the qcd action. this calculation also meets the set of problems
connected with

1. the gribov ambiguity [29] due to the zero mode d2(b) = 0 in the perturbation

theory,

2. the violation of gauge invariance due to the anomaly (5.7),

3. the violation of translational invariance due to the external eld b(~x),

4. missing lorentz covariance.

let us consider in the following how the introduction of topological dirac variables helps
to cure all these problems.

b. solution by topological dirac variables

first of all, to remove the gribov ambiguity, we should extract zero modes of the
gauss law constraint to dene the longitudinal function f and the non-abelian instanta-
neous interactions on the class of functions without zero mode where the faddev-popov
determinant is not equal to zero.

then, we construct the topological dirac variables

at + (bt ) = u[][a + (b + )] u []1; t = u []

(5.8)

and announce that these variables correspond to observables. as a consequence, the
topological functional x converts into the independent global variable n0 and mixes with
the 0-meson channel thus changing its mass.

the eective hadronic lagrangian in the pseudoscalar, isoscalar (-meson) channel in

its rest frame has the form [16]

lef f (n0, 0) =

n 2
0 mn
2

+

1
2

02
( 2
0  m2

0)v + c0(t) n0 .

after diagonalization it reveals the mass shift of the 0-meson

lef f (n 0, 0) =

n 0

2

mn
2

+

1
2

where

0  (m2
[ 2

0 + m2)2

0]v ,

n 0 = n0 + c0(t)/mn

is a new topological variable, and

m2 =

(c)2
mn v

=

s4nf
6f

(5.9)

(5.10)

(5.11)

(5.12)

is the mass shift of the 0-meson which is in agreement with the experimental data when
the shifman-vainshtein-zakharov condensate value (4.4) < sg2(b) >= 24 [18] is used.
thus, we dene both the gauge-invariant variables in terms of which the procedure of
hadronization should be fullled and the eective infrared parameter of hadronization .

c. topological connement

another consequence of the topological gauge-xing of sources of the observable elds
is the nonperturbative zero-mode phase factor in front of any colored state, which depends
on the topological variable n0. in perturbation theory, instead of the colored states in
the conventional gauge < 1|a+|d(~x) >, we get the topologically dressed ones

< 1|a+|t (~x)) >= exp[n0 0(~x)] < 1|a+|d(~x) > .

fixing the topological momentum as a conserved quantum number requires the averaging
of colored state amplitudes over the parameter of degeneration n0 and over the euler
angles of the matrix  in the color space.

this averaging can lead to connement as a complete destructive interference phe-
nomenon [7,30]. thus, all colored local variables become ghosts. they occur in feynman
diagrams but not in the observable asymptotic states. the observable states are colorless
bound states which depend on the translation-invariant relative coordinate (x  y).

d. relativistic covariance

in qed, in terms of the dirac variables, the poincare symmetry is realized which is
mixing with the gauge one [3]. this mixing was interpreted in 1930 by heisenberg and
pauli [2] (with reference to the unpublished note by von neumann) as the transition from
the coulomb gauge with respect to the time axis in the rest frame (l0
 = (1, 0, 0, 0)) to the
coulomb gauge with respect to the time axis in the moving frame.

l = l0

 + ll

0 = (ll0).

the coulomb interaction has the covariant form

wc = z dxdy

1
2

l (x)vc(z)jt
jt

l (y)(l  z) ,

where

l = e t /lt , z
jt

 = z  l(z  l) , z = (x  y) .

(5.13)

(5.14)

this transformation law of the lorentz covariance was reproduced in quantum theory by
zumino [3].

in the non-abelian theory, in the moving lorentz frame an observer sees the moving
wu-yang monopole [23] with the corresponding dynamics. we should only manage to
realize this transformation law on the level of operators.

vi. conclusion

in this paper, we have presented a scheme for the introduction of topological gauge-
invariant variables in qcd by generalizing the concept of dirac variables from qed to
non-abelian gauge theories for the example of two-color qcd. we construct a model for
these variables using a zero mode of the gauss law constraint from the class of functions
which disappear at spatial innity but have nonzero surface integrals. the model is based
on the condition that the winding number functional converts into the zero-mode. it is
shown that the corresponding equation of invariance has a solution for asymptotically
stationary elds in the form of the wu-yang monopole.

following wu and yang [22], we consider this monopole except for the singularity at
the origin. in the considered region of the space, the zero-mode solution of the gauss
law constraint forms the -vacuum [24,25] and leads to a nite constraint-shell action for
denite values of the strong coupling constant.

to construct the generating functional of the quantum eld theory, it requires only
the constraint-shell action, where the (global) zero-mode part represents surface integrals
dened in the region at spatial innity. we suggest that in this region the gauge elds
are stationary and the zero-mode solution is factorizing.

in the eld of the wu-yang monopole the instantaneous quark-quark potential is a
sum of the coulomb potential and the golden-section one. the latter one can lead to

15

spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and to mesonic bound states. the -meson mixes
with the zero-mode so that after diagonalization of this low-energy action a mass shift of
the -meson is obtained which resolves the ua(1) problem.

color amplitudes contain additional phase factors which depend on the zero-mode.
averaging the color amplitudes over the zero-mode parameters leads to the phenomenon
of complete destructive interference [7], so that the color amplitudes disappear.

according to heisenberg, pauli [2] and zumino [3], the relativistic covariance is es-
tablished by a rotation of the timelike axis so that the coulomb eld moves together
with relativistic bound states. recently, faddeev and niemi [23] constructed a similar
relativistically covariant form of eective lagrangian using the wu-yang monopole.

in summary the present scheme for the introduction of topological gauge-invariant
variables is a promising tool for the investigation of the challenging properties of qcd
such as the meson spectrum, chiral symmetry breaking, quark and gluon connement,
and the ua(1) anomaly. detailed numerical analyses and the generalization to suc(3) are
to be presented in a subsequent work.
