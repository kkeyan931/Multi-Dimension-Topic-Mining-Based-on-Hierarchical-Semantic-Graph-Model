(28), naively one might conclude favorable conguration decay original funnel. course, incorrect q d3- branes decay single d3-brane. rather one think new solution dierent superselection sector, distinguished construction imposing distinct set boundary conditions (or alternatively r ). q n actually d-string point view, scalar elds start vary extremely rapidly description terms low energy world-volume action (7) break point reached. hand, world-volume scalars slowly varying small, formulation give reliable description physics. behavior complementary d3-brane analysis. point 17 view, world-volume elds slowly varying small large r, rapidly varying small r. thus two approaches give complementary descriptions dbi spike. note complementarity arises duality8 n2 r (74) world-volume coordinates two dierent formulations. let us try precise ranges validity think trust born-infeld analysis approaches. essentially, must determine condently ignore higher derivative corrections action arising usual expansion string theory. schematically would require s2 . spike soliton d3-brane, translates r s, using eq. (74), ns. d-string funnel point view, must require s, equivalent r ns. see large n limit, signicant overlap region, explains, least partially, good agreement nd two approaches regime. beyond higher derivative corrections, nonabelian action (1,3) requires additional higher order commutator corrections  see also discussion ref. {$9510017$}. given limitation, might conclude nonabelian d-string calculations reliable small commutators. bps funnel, require s| r| 1 since commutators scalar elds characterized dimensionless quantity r. terms physical radius, restriction becomes r ns, coincides restriction derived previous discussion. better restriction avoiding higher commutator corrections taylor expansion square root action (23) converge rapidly. requirement leads restrictive condition r ns. however, large n, still overlap d3-brane approach large region. add, however, discussion applies generic eld corrections. indications supersymmetric congurations, higher commutator corrections may vanish , less conservative restriction may correct one bps funnel. also remember neglected gravitational eects, justied gn 1. since none analysis involves string coupling g, requirement easily satised going weak coupling. section 4, also found remarkable agreement dynamics small uctuations d-string funnel d3-brane spike, large n also n. analysis begins show signicant discrepancies higher modes. particular, spectrum modes noncommutative funnel truncated max = n 1. brings us puzzle arising ref. {$9510017$}. detailed analysis uctuations d3-brane spike showed suppression higher modes near core. hence modes arbitrarily large appeared propagate innity, spike would seem retain three-dimensional character arbitrarily far rather making transition string- like behavior. since d-string analysis provides reliable description physics core spike, conclude result cannot correct. found nite number modes propagate far d3-brane. note, however, n d-strings, number n 2, n, due nonabelian character coincident d-strings. 8for simplicity, set = 0 here. assume irreducible n n representation large n, c n 2. assumptions apply throughout remainder discussion. 18 considered detail regimes d3-brane d-string descriptions would trustworthy. however, analysis spike funnel solution itself, plays role background calculations linearized uctuations. hence repeat preceding analysis uctuations themselves. particular, uctuation d3-brane angular momentum number oscillates spheres constant radius eective wavelength = r/. hence higher derivative corrections d3-brane action negligible, must require /s 1. hence r eq. (74), (n/)s. therefore even assume n large, trust linearized equations motion accurately describe propagation uctuations far spike n. similarly regime validity analysis uctuations d-string funnel restrictive higher modes. case, require higher commutator corrections nonabelian born-infeld action remain negligible. given commutators eq. (68), appears relevant quantity characterize commutators r. thus calculations would trustworthy r (n/)s s. hence conclude expect two approaches agree dynamics linearized uctuations n higher. therefore seems resolution conict results ref. {$9510017$} present paper dynamics high modes signicantly altered transition region regimes either two formulations trusted. particular, higher derivative corrections d3-brane action must play important role near core spike, cause high modes reected back region large radius. unfortunately, beyond observations made above, provide detailed account suppression mechanism. summarize, seen born-infeld action remarkably powerful tool describing low energy dynamics dp-branes. one hand, d3- brane action one construct spike congurations corresponding d-strings attached d3-brane, validity solutions seems go far beyond naive expectations. paper, shown congurations also emerge d-string action terms noncommutative geometry. formulation provides reliable description central core dbi spike, also reliable large radius number d-strings large. hence nd surprising agreement original d3-brane theory point view. combining two approaches presents intriguing picture d-strings attached orthogonal d3-brane. large radius continuous d3-brane smoothly deformed spike geometry. however, near core far along spike, metamorphosis discrete structure, namely noncommutative funnel geometry. one begin gain insight transition recent observations ref. {$9510017$}. d3-brane analysis, spike magnetic monopole. thus also constant ux magnetic eld spheres constant radius surrounding spike. radius shrinks local ux density becomes large, hence expect enter regime noncommutative geometry provides ecient description system. despite striking agreement shape d3-brane spike d-string funnel, one may question whether agreement actually complete. ref. {$9510017$}, thorlacius showed bps spike solution found d3-brane actually solution full string action. analysis made electric spike describing fundamental string, appears proof would involved magnetic monopole describing d-string . certainly d3-brane d-string theories yield shape 19 latter conguration, however agree overall coecient large n. small n, coecients dier signicantly. may still monopole provides exact boundary conformal eld theory, renormalization metric relevant describing geometry. would somewhat similar dierence closed open string metrics situations noncommutative geometry relevant {$9510017$}. however, leave question future work. would interesting generalize present discussion d-brane systems. extension dp-branes ending orthogonal d(p + 2)-branes would follow trivially application t-duality. interesting extension would consider d-string ending orthogonal dp-brane p 6= 3. lowest order equation motion (10), static conguration would still satisfy 2 =hj, i . (75) ansatz = r() gi constant matrices gi, equation still yield dierential equation form r = r3 , (76) constant a, one nd solutions form r 1. hence type prole universal funnels d-string situation, dierence d3-brane funnel overall constant coecient. result slightly surprising since dual dp-brane formulation, one would generically expect large r, solutions essentially harmonic functions behaving like r(p2) r 1/(p2). resolution puzzle seems two proles apply distinct regimes, rst small r second large r. however, possibility solutions full born-infeld action display transition one kind behavior another. fact, begun analyzing case d-string ending orthogonal d5-brane detail, nd funnel solutions indeed make kind transition {$9611050$}. acknowledgments research supported nserc canada fonds fcar du quebec. would like thank curt callan, aki hashimoto, simeon hellerman, cliord johnson, amanda peet, wati taylor, mark van raamsdonk larus thorlacius useful conversations. grateful koji hashimoto simeon hellerman bringing attention interpretation nonabelian d-string theory terms nahm equations. nrc would also like thank physics department ucsb hospitality course work. research itp, ucsb supported nsf grant phy94-07194.
