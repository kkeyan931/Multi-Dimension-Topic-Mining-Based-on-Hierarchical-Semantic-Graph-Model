(6) a, b denote ve-dimensional indices. corresponding equation motion takes form using (2) decomposing equation four-dimensional fth dimen- sional parts one nds: a(cid:16)ggabb(cid:17) = 0 . let us decompose eld follows: 1 1 a2 y(cid:16)a2y(cid:17) = 0 . (x, y) = (x) (y). (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) plane wave propagates four-dimensional worldvolume satises cor- responding four-dimensional equation motion: using this, introducing new variable (x) = m2(x) . u(y) = a(y) (y) , one gets following schrodinger equation y-dependent part: h2 m2 eh|y| + h 2 2h(y)i u(y) = 0 . equation coincides one localized graviton . zero-mass solution (m2 = 0) equation takes form: u(y) = c eh|y| , (13) 5 c constant. interesting that, written terms original variable , scalar zero-mode constant (y) = c . (14) rst glance, solution could localized since suppressed away brane. nevertheless, solution still considered localized mode. presence exponential warp factor metric (2) allows one perform following decomposition zero-mode 1 2 z d4xdyg gab a0 b0 = 1 2 z + dyg2(y)gz d4x(x)(x) 2 z d4x (x)(x) , = 1 (15) set c = qh/2. thus, zero-mode 0(x, y) = qh/2 (x). moreover, eld (x) eectively localized brane worldvolume due exponentially decreasing warp factor. notice zero-mode resembles zero-mode standard kaluza-klein compactication. surprising since eective size fth dimension, l, nite, l 1/h, spite fact dimension compact {$9907209$}. let us stress also constant localized solution possible warp factor (3), (4). case gravitons , equation (12) gives rise tower continuum states m2 > 0. states produce nonzero contribution order 1/r3 usual four-dimensional 1/r potential mediated massless scalar exchange brane. picture similar localized graviton . 2.2 spin-1 elds localized solutions case. although constant solution similar (14), nevertheless, lagrangian vector eld yield suppressing warp factor crucial case scalars. let us see details. using denition 5d eld-strength fab = avb bva , (16) choosing gauge v5 = 0, decomposing remaining part massless vector eld v(x, y) = v(x)(y) , (17) 1 get (f v v) 4 z d4xdyg gab gcd fac fbd = = 6 1 1 dyg2(y)ggz d4xff 4 z + 4 z d4x ffz + dy 2(y) .(18) diverges (y) constant. nontrivial solutions equation motion vector eld, could give localized solutions? one check normalizable solutions exist. since issue already studied orbifold version rs scenario  skip derivations. net result neither (3) (4) localizes massless vector elds. 2.3 spin-1/2 fermions start lagrangian massless spin-1/2 fermions ig bdb . (19) corresponding equation motion decomposed follows: (cid:16) + 5 d5(cid:17) (x, y) = 0 . relations curved-space gamma matrices ({a, b} = 2gab) minkowskian ones ({a, b} = 2ab) read follows: (20) = 1 , 5 = 5 . (21) spin-connection covariant derivative also calculated metric (2): = + 5 , d5 = 5 . (22) 4a conventions set decompose ve-dimensional spinor four-dimensional fth-dimensional parts: (x, y) = (x)(y). require four-dimensional part satises massless equation motion (x) = 0. result, obtain following equation dependent part + solution equation reads: a!

(23) (24) (y) = c a(y) . normalizable rs case (3), normalizable warp factor (4) used. see this, one decompose action (19) follows: z d4xz + z + dyg (x, y)ibdb(x, y) = dya3/2(y)2(y)z d4x (x)i(x) , 7 innite a(y) dened (3), nite a(y) (4) (we choose c = h/2 get correct normalization)6. order localize spin-1/2 fermions rs framework one could use method localization due jackiw rebbi {$9612128$}. this, one introduces interaction fermions scalar eld, . scalar interpolate two dierent vacua dierent sides brane (one could take kink solution, instance). gives eective ve-dimensional mass fermions (constant fermion mass approximation good enough scalar heavy). however, ve-dimensional fermion mass term would ip sign reection respect brane. circumstances, chiral left(right)-handed component fermion localized brane {$9612128$}. equation motion fermion takes form: + + i5m  !

(26) likewise, background (4), mode l localized < h/4. 2.4 spin-3/2 fermions consideration gravitinos similar spin-1/2 fermions. therefore, discussions brief. equation motion massless gravitino reads as:  db c = 0 . (27) here, square brackets denote antisymmetrization w.r.t. indices. choose gauge 5 = 0 split remaining elds (x, y) = (x) u(y). using four-dimensional gauge choice = = 0, four-dimensional equation motion massless spin-3/2 eld  = 0, one nds following equation dependent part: + 2a! u(y) = 0 . solution equation u(y) = (28) (29) c . qa(y) 6after obtained results work {$9612128$} appeared, shown orbifold rs construction massless spin- 1/2 elds localized brane. 8 rs case normalizable function. action z d4xz + z + dyg a(x, y)idbc(x, y) = dya1/2(y)u2(y)z d4x (x)i(x) , (30) diverges integration. hand, exponentially rising warp factor (4), integral nite 4d action canonically normalized c = h/2. therefore, solution (4) admits localized free spin-3/2 zero-mode 3-brane. notice mode chiral. finally, let us comment possibility localization gravitinos back- ground (3). one introduce additional interactions happen (as case spin-1/2 elds). simplest way would realize rs solution (3) n = 2 ve-dimensional supergravity. case, one could hope nd bps 3-brane preserves half original supersymmetries. since background (3) localizes gravitons, supersymmetry, sugra coun- terpart would also localize gravitinos. dynamical reason localization gravitinos could interactions elds corresponding sugra. detailed studies issues could subject separate project. 3 cosmological constant brane section study happens bulk cosmological constant ne- tuned critical value dened eq.
