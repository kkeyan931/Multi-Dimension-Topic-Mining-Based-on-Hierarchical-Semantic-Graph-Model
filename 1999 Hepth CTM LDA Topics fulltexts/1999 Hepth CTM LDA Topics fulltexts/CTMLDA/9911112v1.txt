abstract

certain exact results in supersymmetric gauge theories are generated by non-perturbative

eects dierent from instantons.

in supersymmetric qcd with n colours and nf funda-
mental avours we examine the aeck-dine-seiberg (ads) superpotential using controlled
semi-classical analysis. we show how for nf < n  1 the ads superpotential arises from
monopole contributions to the path integral of the supersymmetric gauge theory compactied
on r3 s1. these are the monopole eects leading to gaugino condensation and connement
of the low-energy su(n  nf) supersymmetric gauge theory.

introduction and motivation

one of the famous exact results in supersymmetry is the aeck-dine-seiberg (ads) super-

potential [1] generated in supersymmetric qcd with nf fundamental avours and gauge
group su(n)

it is well known that for nf < n  1 the ads superpotential receives no contributions from
instantons, and arises from non-perturbative eects associated with gaugino condensation in
the unbroken su(n  nf) gauge group [1]. in our earlier work [2] we showed that gaugino
condensation is generated by monopole contributions to the path integral of supersymmetric
gauge theories compactied on r3 s1. in this paper we make an obvious link between these
two ideas [1, 2] and explicitly derive the ads superpotential in the background of n  nf
varieties of su(n  nf) monopoles embedded in the su(n) supersymmetric qcd with
nf avours. we will also explain why this semi-classical derivation is valid in the a priori
strongly coupled theory. for related work on r3  s1 in a dierent context see [35].

the last few years have seen an impressive agreement between known exact results in

supersymmetric gauge theories and direct eld-theoretical calculations. in most of the cases

considered, the non-perturbative information contained in the exact results [68] was re-

stricted to multi-instanton contributions [911]. at the same time, some of the known exact

results in supersymmetric gauge theories are generated by non-perturbative eects dierent

from instantons. we expect that these non-perturbative eects can still be evaluated and

understood semi-classically, but in slightly unusual settings. the motivation of this letter

and of its predecessor ref. [2] is to show how this works for two important examples: gaugino

condensation and the ads superpotential. in both cases there is a non-abelian, asymptot-

ically free (sub)group which makes the theory strongly coupled. this is an obstacle for a

direct application of semi-classical analysis, which makes these cases qualitatively dierent

from the weakly coupled scenarios:

1. in the seiberg-witten case [6] the su(n) gauge group is broken by the higgs mecha-
nism to the abelian subgroup u(1)n1 with eective couplings determined by the vevs.
the holomorphic nature of this dependence, guaranteed by non-renormalization theorems in
n = 2, then allows one to travel smoothly to an arbitrarily weak coupling regime saturated
by the relevant semi-classical physics: perturbation theory, and multi-instanton eects cal-

culated in [9, 10].
2. in general, when there is no unbroken non-abelian subgroup, the f-terms in any n = 1

2

supersymmetric theory can be usually determined with a constrained instanton calcula-

tion [1, 1518] as reviewed in [19]. a simple example of this set-up is the supersymmetric
qcd with nf = n  1.
3. in the ads/cft programme [7] the non-abelian gauge group is unbroken, but the -

function is zero, and for successful multi-instanton calculations [8, 1114], the constant cou-

pling can be taken as small as needed.

it has been suspected for a long time [20] that in the strongly coupled theories, instantons

should be thought of as composite states of more basic congurations, the instanton partons.

these partons would give important contributions to the non-perturbative dynamics at strong

coupling. in ref. [2] we identied the instanton partons with the n varieties of monopoles

which appear when minkowski space-time of su(n) supersymmetric gauge theory is partially
compatied on r3  s1. this compactication is required for two reasons. first, because
of the nite radius  of s1, the monopole solutions have nite action, which makes them
important semi-classically. second, the gauge elds with lorentz index referring to the s1
direction develop vacuum expectation values [2]

(1.2)

which break the non-abelian su(n) to the abelian subgroup u(1)n1. as the vevs are
inversely proportional to the radius , the theory becomes weakly coupled at small  and can

be analysed semi-classically. to return to the strongly coupled theory in minkowski space,

we need to consider the opposite limit of large . since all the f-terms are holomorphic

functions of the elds and since the vevs of the elds (1.2) are holomorphic functions of ,

the power of holomorphy [21] allows to analytically continue the semi-classical values of the

f-terms to the strong-coupling regime.

in supersymmetric qcd with n colours and nf fundamental avours in the higgs phase,
the gauge group is broken by the matter vevs to su(n  nf). in section ii we will review
the monopole calculus in the theory with nf = 0 on r3  s1. the monopole eects in this
theory generate the gaugino condensate and give a mass to the dual (magnetic) photon which

implies connement of electric charges. in section iii we will include the matter elds and

start in uncompactied minkowski space. we will rst integrate out the classically massive
(higgsed) elds. the resulting eective lagrangian will contain the massless mesons m = qq
and the strongly-interacting massless su(n  nf) gauge supermultiplet, wsu (n nf). these
two sectors will be coupled to each other in the eective lagrangian via non-renormalizable

interactions generated perturbatively by integrating out massive elds propagating in the
loops. the next step will be to integrate out the gauge supermultiplet, wsu (n nf). this is

3

achieved in the monopole background in the su(n  nf) theory compactied on r3  s1.
the superpotential for mesons  the ads superpotential (1.1)  arises from the gauge-meson

interactions when the gauge supermultiplet is integrated out. hence, the ads superpotential

(1.1) is a combination of perturbative and monopole eects. the analysis of section iii can

be schematically represented as

z dwsu (n) dqd q eir d4x l(wsu (n),q, q)
= z dwsu (n nf) dm eir d4x l

(1)

e (wsu (n nf),m ) = z dm eir d4x l

(1.3)

(2)

e (m ) .

we stress that eq. (1.3) represents a direct evaluation of the ads superpotential contained
in l(2)
e (m). in particular we are not apealing to renormalization group arguments relating
expressions for dierent values of nf. none of the meson degrees of freedom were integrated
out on the right hand side of eq. (1.3), and the f-term of l(2)
e (m) is the denition of the
general ads superpotential w nf,n

ii monopoles in sym on r3  s1

in this section we consider the pure n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills theory coupled to a
background chiral supereld t ()

z(t ()) = z dw eir d4x l(w,t ()) = ei(r d4x d2 we (t ())+h.c.) .

(2.1)

here w denotes the su(n) eld-strength chiral supereld, and t () is a non-dynamical
background chiral supereld

the superscript  indicates the (high) energy scale where t () becomes dynamical. the
microscopic lagrangian dening the theory reads

l =

(2.3)

the dynamical quantities we are after are the eective superpotential we(t ()) dened
in eq. (2.1) and the gaugino condensate htrn 2i in the presence of the  eld. the two
quantities are related due to a functional identity

gauge theory on r3  s1

let x4 be periodic with period /2.1 we must then impose periodic boundary conditions
for bosons, am(x, x4 = 0) = am(x, x4 = ) and fermions, (x, x4 = 0) = (x, x4 = ) to
preserve supersymmetry. in addition, the local gauge group itself must also be composed of
gauge transformations periodic on s1: u(x, x4 = 0) = u(x, x4 = ). we now summarize
the results of the analysis carried out in ref. [2].

1. there are n classically at directions of the vacuum moduli space of the compactied
theory parametrized by ha4i = diag(a1, a2, . . . , an ). this classical moduli space is lifted
non-trivially at the quantum level to

(2.5)

by the monopole-generated superpotential derived in the section iii of

[2]. the distinctive

feature of (2.5) is the constant equal spacing between the vevs aj.

2. the semi-classical physics of the r3s1 su(n) theory is described by congurations of
monopoles of n dierent types. in general, the eld congurations of the r3s1 theory which
are relevant in the semi-classical regime are both instantons and monopoles. remarkably, the
instantons on r3  s1 can be understood as composite congurations of n single monopoles,
one of each of the n dierent types [2224]. one expects in an su(n) theory on r4 that
the lowest charged monopoles come in n  1 dierent varieties, carrying a unit of magnetic
charge from each of the u(1) factors of the u(1)n1 gauge group left unbroken by the vevs.
the additional monopole, needed to make up the n types, is specic to the compactication
on r3  s1 [23,24]. the magnetic charge of the new monopole is such that when all n types
of monopoles are present, the magnetic charges cancel and the resulting conguration only

carries a unit instanton charge.

monopole calculus in su(2)

these expressions are obviously independent of the s1 variable x4, since the latter can be
thought of as the time coordinate of the static monopole. the boundary values of (2.6) as
|x|  , when gauge rotated to unitary (singular) gauge, agree with (2.5) for v = /

(2.10)

here m and n are the four pauli matrices and  is the two-component grassmann collective
coordinate. the semi-classical integration measure of the standard single-monopole on r3s1

(2.11)

this measure is obtained in the standard way by changing variables in the path integral

from eld-uctuations around the monopole to the monopoles collective coordinates. the

uv-regularized determinants over non-zero eigenvalues of the quadratic uctuation operators

cancel between fermions and bosons due to supersymmetry. the ultra-violet divergences are

regularized in the pauli-villars scheme, which explains the appearance of the pauli-villars

mass scale . we can now compute the single monopole contribution to(cid:10)tr2(cid:11) as in ref. [2]:

(cid:10)tr2(cid:11)bps

= z dbps tr (bps (x)bps

 (x)) = 823 exp[it ()] .

(2.12)

as explained in ref. [2] the monopole of the second type will give a contribution identical

to (2.12). putting the two together we get

(cid:10)tr2(cid:11) = 162 3 exp[it ()] .

6

(2.13)

substituting (2.13) into (2.4) gives the equation for the superpotential we( ) with the
solution

we (t ()) = 23 exp[it ()] .

(2.14)

the expressions (2.13) and (2.14) are, in spite of appearences, renormalization group invariant
and -independet. we also note that the dependence on the s1 radius  disappeared, and
the decompactication limit    does not change the nal results (2.13) and (2.14).

generalization to su(n)

the calculation of the gaugino condensate and the superpotential can be straightforwardly

generalized to the case of gauge group su(n). the quantum vacuum has

aj  aj+1 =

,

j = 1, 2, . . . , n ,

(2.15)

and each of the n types of monopoles has equal actions and equal topological charges:

(2.16)

the contribution of n monopoles to the gaugino condensate and the superpotential is

straightforward:

this concludes our analysis of supersymmetric qcd with nf = 0.

iii ads superpotential in supersymmetric qcd

the microscopic theory is dened in terms of the su(n) vector supereld coupled to nf
chiral superelds in the [n] reperesentation, qur (u = 1, . . . , n; r = 1, . . . , nf), and to
nf chiral superelds in the [ n] reperesentation, qru. the global classical symmetry of the
lagrangian is

su(nf)left  su(nf)right  u(1)v  u(1)a  u(1)r ,

(3.1)

where u(1)r is the anomaly-free combination of the r-symmetry and the axial u(1)a:

w ()  eiw (ei) , q()  ei(nnf)/nfq(ei) ,

q()  ei(nnf)/nf q(ei) .

(3.2)

7

at the quantum level the classical u(1)a symmetry is anomalous, and the global quantum
symmetry of the lagrangian is su(nf)left  su(nf)right  u(1)v  u(1)r.

the classical vacuum state is determined in the standard way via the d-atness condition

and can be brought to a simple rectangular diagonal form:

hauri = n urvr , u=1,... ,nf

0 , u=nf+1,... ,n

= h auri .

(3.3)

the nf complex vacuum expectation values v1, . . . , vnf are not xed by the classical la-
grangian, and parameterize the nf-complex-dimensional classical vacuum moduli space of
the theory. it is now straightforward to determine which symmetries of the lagrangian are

left unbroken by the classical vacuum (3.3). the su(n) gauge symmetry is spontaneously
broken by (3.3) to su(n  nf). in order to determine the surviving global symmetry it
is convenient to restrict ourselves to the case of all vevs equal, v1 = v2 = . . .  v. this
choice will not aect the counting of classically massless degrees of freedom, but will simplify

the symmetry reasoning. this vacuum state breaks the u(1)a and u(1)r. it also breaks
su(nf)left  su(nf)right to the diagonal su(nf) subgroup that rotates ar and ar in the
same way and is further compensated by the gauge transformation, such that the vacuum is
unchanged. thus, the global symmetry respected by the vacuum is su(nf) u(1)v. hence,
2 + 1 real
we expect nf
massless scalars coming from the broken generators of the global su(nf)  u(1)a  u(1)r.
when the non-perturbative eects are taken into account one of these massless degrees of
2 real scalar degrees of freedom

2 + 1 massless goldstone bosons at the perturbative level, i.e. nf

freedom will acquire a mass due to the u(1)a anomaly, and nf
will remain massless.

at the same time, the number of classically massless real scalar degrees of freedom is
2. this is twice the number of exact goldstone bosons. the remaining nf
2 classically
2nf
massless real scalars must be lifted by a non-perturbatively generated superpotential. the

functional form of this superpotential eq. (1.1) was uniquely determined in [1].

the ads superpotential appears in the low-energy eective description of the microscopic
theory with nf  n  1. it is important to distinguish between the two cases: nf = n  1
where the gauge group is completely broken by the vacuum; and nf < n  1 where the
non-abelian gauge subgroup su(n  nf) is unbroken. the rst case is relatively simple
and is well understood [1, 17, 18]. for nf = n  1 the superpotential is generated at the
1-instanton level, and since the gauge group is completely broken, the instanton calculation
in the second, more general case, nf < n  1, instantons
are known to give trivially vanishing conributions to (1.1), nevertheless the renormalization

is reliable and infra-red safe.

8

group decoupling argument from nf = n  1 to nf < n  1 requires the superpotential to
be non-vanishing, and determines the normalzation consant in (1.1) [17,18,21] to be n  nf.

nf < n  1: step one

for nf < n  1 there is an unbroken gauge subgroup su(n  nf) and as discussed in
the introduction, it is important to realise that the generation of the ads superpotential

is the two-step process represented by eq. (1.3). we rst look at the perturbative decou-

pling of the massive vector bosons and higgs bosons. this step is the generalization of
the aeck-dine-seiberg nf = 1 argument from section 4 of ref. [1] to all nf < n  1.
2 classically massless real scalars and
the relevant matter degrees of freedom are the 2nf
2 chiral supereld (complex) degrees of
their superpartners. they can be packaged into nf
2 gauge-invariant composite chiral meson superelds
freedom. in fact, there are precisely nf
s (x, ) = qru(x, )qus(x, ). as the scalar components of the superelds m have the mass-
m r
dimension two we prefer to use an equivalent parametrisation of matter degrees of freedom

in terms of mass-dimension one chiral superelds

(3.4)

the logarithm is used for the later convenience and the mass-dimension one in (3.4) is

achieved via explicit dependence on the classical vev v which will be necessary in the

perturbative decoupling treatment, but will disappear from the nal results. in fact, all the

non-renormalizable interactions induced by integrating out the heavy elds will be in terms

of higher dimensional operators of the light elds divided by the powers of v. a perturbative
(or semi-classical) treatment is applicable as long as v is large compared to nf,n , which will
be assumed. there is a unique operator of dimension ve which couples the two sectors,

there are of course even higher-dimensional operators coupling the two sectors, but they

are suppressed by higher powers of v and will not contribute at the relevant order. further-

more, perturbative non-renormalization theorems will prevent the generation of the superpo-

tential made solely of the  elds as no such superpotential existed classically. finally, note
that eq. (3.6) should be thought of as the wilson eective lagrangian with  in g2() on the
right hand side of (3.6) being the wilson scale. in deriving l(1)

we now see from equations (1.3) and (3.9) that the problem of deriving the ads super-

su(n  nf) supersymmetric yang-mills theory partially compactied on r3  s1. the
