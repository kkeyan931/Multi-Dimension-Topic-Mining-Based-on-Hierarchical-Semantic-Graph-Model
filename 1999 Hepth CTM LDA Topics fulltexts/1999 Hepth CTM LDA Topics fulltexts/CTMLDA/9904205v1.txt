1 introduction

topological eld theories [1] are mathematically as well as physically interesting [2]. in
four dimensions we have two interesting topological eld theories, the topological yang
mills model [2] and the antisymmetric tensor eld model [3]. the algebraic renormaliza-
tion2 of the topological yangmills eld theory was carried out in [4] and then extended
to curved spacetime in [5]. on the other hand, the algebraic renormalization of the
antisymmetric tensor eld model (in the at spacetime limit) was rst done in [6] and
then generalized to a curved spacetime admitting a covariantly constant vector eld in
[7]. in this work we will go a step further and try to generalize the analysis of [7] to an
arbitrary, curved, riemannian manifold.
the paper is organized as follows, in section 2 we give the gauge xed action and display
the brs transformations of all the elds appearing in the model. next, in section 3 we
derive the onshell local supersymmetrylike transformations, i.e. the anticommutator of
the brs operator and of the local susylike operator leads to lie derivative . in section 4
we extend the onshell analysis (of section 3) to the oshell level. here we will see that
the local susylike ward operator, when it acts on the total action describing the model,
gives rise to a hard breaking which is quadratic in the quantum elds. in order to elimi-
nate this quadratic breaking we introduce auxiliary elds. the result of this construction
is that the anticommutator of the linearized slavnov operator and the ward operator of
the new symmetry does not close on dieomorphisms for certain elds. furthermore, the
most important fact is that the total action is invariant under this new, local, nonlinear
(and not susylike) symmetry.
on the other hand, one could use this symmetry (rst one has to show its validity at all
order of perturbation theory) to prove the niteness of the 4d antisymmetric tensor eld
model in a general class of curved manifolds: generalizing the results of [7].

2 the model

first let us consider the following classical action in curved spacetime

inv =

(1)

where m is a curved manifold described by the euclidean metric g. the eld strength
is described by
(2)

f a
 = aa

 + f abcab

ac
 ,

   aa

where aa
 is the gauge eld which belongs to the adjoint representation of a compact lie
group whose structure constants are denoted by f abc. the antisymmetric tensor eld ba

is also lie algebra valued and  is the levicivita tensor density3 of weight +1. on

2more details about the subject of algebraic renormalization can be found in the last reference of [8]
3in this paper we denote the inverse of the metric by g and its determinant by g. under dieo-
morphisms, g behaves like a scalar density of weight +1, whereas the volume element density d4x has
weight -1. the levicivita antisymmetric tensor density  has weight +1 and  has weight 1.

we could extend the brs transformations (see last line of (6)) by letting s acting on the
metric g because, at the level of the gauge xed action inv + gf , the metric appears
only in a brs exact expression [7], a fact which guarantee its non physical character.
it turned out [7] that the brs operator, constructed above, is nilpotent onshell. more
precisely,

and s2 = 0 for the other elds .

3 the onshell analysis

in the at spacetime limit the authors of [6] constructed, besides the brs transforma-
tions, a further symmetry of the gauge xed action, the so called vector supersymmetry
like transformations. their analysis was generalized [7] to the case of a curved spacetime
admitting a covariantly constant vector eld. in both cases the supersymmetrylike trans-
formations were rigid transformations. in this paper we make a further step and try to
construct a local supersymmetrylike transformations (at least onshell), so let us begin
by proposing the following transformations

 = ggg a
 = ggca ,

()ca = aa

()ca = 0 ,

,
()a = a
 ,
() a = 0 ,
()a = l a ,
()ea = 0 ,
()a = lea ,
()g = 0 ,
()g = lg ,

(8)

where l is the lie derivative and  is the vector parameter of the transformations with
ghost number +2. it turns out that the onshell algebra takes the following form

for all elds, except for the antisymmetric tensor eld ba

 where we get

{s, ()} = l + equ. of motion

now to repair this shortcoming we add to the gauge xed action the following expression

is that (10) will get the same form as (9). indeed,

(15)

so, in this way we have constructed an onshell local supersymmetrylike transformations
which anticommute with the brs operator and lead to lie derivative (9). next, we want
to know if the transformations, generated by the operator (), give rise to a symmetry
of the gauge xed action. this question is investigated in the next section where we also
display the oshell algebra.

4 the oshell analysis

in order to generalize the above results to the oshell level we rst introduce external
sources which couple to the nonlinear brs transformations (6)

the nonlinear breaking (21) is quadratic in the quantum elds, then it is not harmless in
the context of the renormalization procedure.
to eliminate the nonlinear expression in (19) we rst add to the action the brs exact
integral

for all auxiliary elds, the anticommutator of the brs operator s and () closes on the
lie derivative plus equations of motion.
on the other hand, the ward identity (18) gets promoted to

at the functional level, the invariance of the classical action (28) under dieomorphisms
can be expressed by an unbroken ward identity

for all elds f . the vector parameter of the dieomorphism transformations is denoted
by , and it carries ghost number +1.
next, we display the complete nonlinear algebra of the slavnov operator and the ward
operator w d
(). to this end, let  be an arbitrary functional depending on the elds of
the model, then

sw d

ss() = 0 ,
()s() = 0 ,
()o  = w d

now if the functional  is a solution of the slavnov identity and of the ward identity of
dieomorphisms, then the oshell algebra (34) reduces to the linear algebra

contrary to other topological eld theories [5] [9], the anticommutator of the linearized
slavnov operator (31) with the linearized4 w s
() ward operator does not give rise to the
dieomorphisms ward operator. indeed, for certain elds we get {s,w s
()} = w d
() and
for other elds the anticommutator does not close on w d
(). as a simple example, one can

the main result of this paper is that we could, after introducing auxiliary elds, construct
a local and nonlinear symmetry of the 4d antisymmetric tensor eld model in a curved
manifold. the next natural step to do is to show the renormalizability of the new sym-
metry. it turns out that if this symmetry is valid at the quantum level then it would be
very useful in showing the niteness of the model in a big class of curved manifolds. this
would be the generalisation of the results of [7].
