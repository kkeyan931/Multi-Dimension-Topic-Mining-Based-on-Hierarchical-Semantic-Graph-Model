equivalently, ri nondegenerate matrix. according standard bv quantization prescription, introduce ghost variables c gauge generator r antields variables x . variables constitute so-called minimal sector gauge theory. corresponding solution classical master equation , c (5.2) smin = x ri c + 1 2 c c cc . x gauge, one enlarge minimal set variables nonminimal one. nonminimal variables antighosts c, auxiliary led b, conjugate antields. one add also nonminimal terms master action. master action becomes (5.3) = smin + c b . proper solution master equation. gauge xing performed choosing gauge fermion . let concentrate zero locus zq master action (5.3). submanifold zq = b = 0 lagrangian submanifold determined equations x conguration space. poisson bracket (2.2) zq reads = c = c (5.4) {xi, c } = ri , {c , c } = c c , brackets vanishing. thus zq equipped nondegenerate poisson bracket. time, submanifold l0 equipped odd nilpotent vector eld qgf (a gauge xed brst transformation (3.6)); local coordinates x, , c, c, reads (5.5) qgf = cri xi 1 2 cc c c c . let turn construction anticanonical transformation relating la- grangian submanifolds zq l0. abelian theory (i.e., structure constants c k ij vanishing), required transformation simply obvious modication transformation (4.3). zero locus reduction 8 nonabelian case, however, one add additional terms. consider following general- ization (4.3) (xi) = xi (x c (b) = c ) = x c b (c) = c , (c ) = c , (c) = b , (c , (b ) = b c c . + c b ) = c , cc , (5.6) proposition 5.1. transformation (5.6) anticanonical (preserves antibracket), globally dened, satises condition (5.7) = (, s) . indeed, transformation (5.6) globally dened construction (since preserves base x ). transformed master action (5.8) = x ri b 1 2 bc b b + c c c c c b c c cb . easy see direct computations (5.9) solves condition (5.7). = cb 1 2 cc cc . follows general treatment section 3 l0 equipped poisson bracket (3.8). local coordinates l0, {xi, b} = ri {c, b} = c {c, c} = , (5.10) , c , {b, b} = c {c, b} = c b , c . jacobi identity bracket (5.10) holds provided satises classical master equation. also follows results sec. 3 qgf given (5.5) compatible poisson bracket (5.10). moreover, (5.11) qgf = {, } thus, least formal level, obtain objects bfv quantization: poisson bracket generating function (the brst charge) . make coincidence clear let choose new coordinates (5.12) qi = xi , pi = r (b + c c c) , p = c , others unchanged. canonical (darboux) coordinates poisson bracket (5.10) (5.13) {xi, pj} = j , {c, p } = . new coordinate system, one gets (5.14) = ct 1 2 p c cc , = ri pi . zero locus reduction 9 standard form brst charge pure gauge theory rst-class constraints given t. moreover, formal level,3 brst charge theory. indeed, rst class constraints satisfy lie algebra gauge transformation r bv formulation;
