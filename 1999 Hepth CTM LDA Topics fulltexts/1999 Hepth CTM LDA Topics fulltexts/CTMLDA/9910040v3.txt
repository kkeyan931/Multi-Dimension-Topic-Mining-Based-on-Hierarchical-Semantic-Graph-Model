we use the counterterm subtraction method to calculate the action and stressenergymomentum
tensor for the (kerr) rotating black holes in adsn+1, for n=2,3 and 4. we demonstrate that the
expressions for the total energy for the kerrads3 and kerrads5 spacetimes, in the limit of van-
ishing black hole mass, are equal to the casimir energies of the holographically dual ndimensional
conformal eld theories. in particular, for kerrads5, dual to the case of four dimensional n =4 su-
persymmetric yangmills theory on the rotating einstein universe, we explicitly verify the equality
of the zero mass stress tensor from the two sides of the correspondence, and present the result for
general mass as a prediction from gravity. amusingly, it is observed in four dimensions that while
the trace of the stress tensor dened using the standard counterterms does not vanish, its integral
does, thereby keeping the action free of ultraviolet divergences. using a dierent regularisation
scheme an improved stress tensor can be dened, which is traceless.

i. introduction

the ads/cft correspondence relates an (n+1)
dimensional theory of gravity on antide sitter (ads)
spacetime (times a compact manifold) to a conformal
eld theory (cft) in n dimensions. this duality rst
arose as a result of investigating [1] n parallel d3
branes in the context of the low energy, (i.e., the limit
of zero , the inverse string tension) classical (weak
string coupling, gs) limit of type iib superstring theory
on ads5s5. a precise statement of the ads/cft cor-
respondence [2,3] is the equality of the partition functions
of the two theories,

zads(i) = zcf t (0,i) .

(1)

from the gravityonads point of view, i is a bulk eld
constrained to the values 0,i on the boundary, while
from the cft point of view, 0,i are sources for point-
like operators, oi, in the theory. in the low energy limit
of the theory one can use the classical gravitational ac-
tion to calculate the partition function of the cft on the
boundary. this action has the form [4],

ibulk + isurf =

n(n  1)

(cid:19)

the rst term is the einsteinhilbert action with nega-
tive cosmological constant (=n(n1)/2l2). the sec-
ond term is the gibbonshawking boundary term. here,
hab is the boundary metric and k is the trace of the
extrinsic curvature k ab of the boundary.

to deal with the divergences which appear in the grav-
itational action (arising from integrating over the in-
nite volume of spacetime), two dierent techniques may
be employed. the traditional background subtraction
technique [4,5] (which subtracts the contribution from a
reference spacetime to get a nite result) and the coun-
terterm subtraction method [6] (which regulates the ac-
tion by the addition of certain boundary counterterms).
as the counterterms depend upon the geometrical prop-
erties of the boundary of the spacetime, the countert-
erm subtraction method provides an intrinsic denition
of the action for a particular spacetime. this sidesteps
problems which arise in using the other method when
the spacetime in question has an ambiguous (or simply
unknown) choice of background.

the divergences of the einsteinhilbert action (in di-
mensions less than six) can be cancelled by adding the
following counterterms:

ict =

1

8gzm

dnxh(cid:20) (n  1)

l



lr

2(n  1)(cid:21) .

(3)

here r is the ricci scalar for the boundary metric h. us-
ing these counterterms one can construct a divergence
free stress tensor which is given by (i=ibulk+isurf +ict):

where gab is the einstein tensor in n dimensions. (cor-
respondingly, the last term should be omitted for n=2.)

(in ref. [7], the counterterm subtraction method was
studied extensively, with many examples, and a new
counterterm was presented there which allows the sub-
traction regularisation to be performed in dimensions
n+1=6, 7. see also refs. [814] for related studies, some
more applications and further extensions.)

the prescription (4) gives a denition of the action and
stresstensor on any region (say, of radius r in the coor-
dinates that we will choose later) bounding the interior
of ads. the ads/cft holographic relation (in the form
which we will need it here) equates these quantities to a
dual conformal eld theory residing on the boundary at
innity (r). the theory on the boundary at radius r
can be taken to be a dual eld theory with an ultravio-
let cuto proportional to r. then r denes the uv
xed point conformal eld theory. this dovetails nicely
with the fact that the counterterms, while regulating an
infrared (ir) divergence coming from the bulk, have the
dual interpretation as regulating uv divergences in the
eld theory [15,6].

recalling that the metric restricted to the boundary,
hab, diverges due to an innite conformal factor r2/l2, we
dene the background metric upon which the dual eld
theory resides as

ab = lim
r

l2
r2 hab .

(5)

consequently, the eld theorys stresstensor, bt ab, is re-

lated to the one above (4) by the rescaling [16]:

(6)

 abbt bc = lim

r

h habt bc ,

which amounts to multiplying all expressions for t ab dis-
played later by (r/l)n2 before taking the limit r.
in this paper we apply these techniques to the study of
the kerradsn+1 spacetimes1, for n=2, 3 and 4. in par-
ticular, we compute the action, stress tensor, and other
quantities, and consider their implications for the dual
eld theories. the dual eld theories are dened on the
rotating spacetimes located at the boundary of kerr
ads, and the results which we present are new for the
three and four dimensional cases.

in fact, for the massless case we exactly reproduce the
four dimensional result for the stress tensor using eld
theory. the results for general mass are oered as pre-
dictions from the gravity side about the strongly coupled
eld theory at nite temperature. along the way, we
learn a number of interesting things about the dual eld
theories in three and four dimensions. in particular, the
trace of the four dimensional stress tensor obtained using
the counterterms (3) for n =4 supersymmetric yang
mills on the rotating einstein universe does not vanish,

1see refs. [1719] for complementary studies of higher di-
mensional kerrads spacetimes and their eld theory duals.

but nevertheless integrates to zero. however, we can de-
ne a new stress tensor possessing the same conserved
physical quantities as the old which is traceless. this
illustrates the ambiguity of the denition of the trace
anomaly in four dimensions, allowing a term proportional
to r to be added.
in the nonrotating case, such a
term is not needed [6], and so we nd here that with
rotation present, a dierent regularisation scheme must
be used [20], corresponding to supplementing the coun-

terterms (3) with a term proportional torm r2. (this

possibility was noted in ref. [6], and we believe that this
is the rst such example in this ads/cft context.)

ii. kerrads3

as a warmup and review, we will study the case of
kerrads3. the explicit computation of the energy
momentum tensor and the mass, angular momentum and
casimir energy using the counterterm subtraction tech-
nique has been done in ref. [6]. here, we will perform all
of those computations in a dierent choice of coordinates,
supplementing the discussion and calculations where nec-
essary. this will serve the twin purposes of setting up the
notation of the rest of the paper, and illustrating the sim-
ilarities to (and dierences from) the higher dimensional
cases which we later present.

we use the form of kerrads3 metric in ref. [17] which
resembles the higher dimensional kerrads metrics and
can be obtained from the btz black hole by coordinate
transformation [21,22]:

it is straightforward to check that this tensor is covari-
antly conserved. notice that when a=0, b vanishes and
a=(2m g1)/(16gl), giving a standard form for the
stressenergymomentum tensor of a uid of massless

particles with some energy density given by bt00. notice

that a, in front of the part of the stress tensor in standard
form contains the black hole parameter m the thermal
part of the eld theory while b, the coecient of the
null vector part, refers only to rotational parameters. we
will nd that this form will persist to higher dimensions.
to calculate the conserved quantities for these space-
times, we use the following denition for a conserved
charge [23], associated to a symmetry generated by the
killing vector :

q =z

dn1xut .

(19)

where u= n t,, while n and  are the lapse function
and the spacelike metric which appear in the admlike
decomposition of the boundary metric

ds2 = n 2dt2 + ab(dxa + n adt)(dxb + n bdt) .
our convention for the killing vectors  is as follows:
t is the killing vector conjugate to the time t and  is
the killing vector conjugate to . using the above deni-
tion for the conserved charge, the mass and the angular
momentum of the kerrads3 spacetime are given by

the action with the other quantities satisfy the rst law

(23)

for n=2, which is a nontrivial check of some of our com-
putations. we will perform this check in the more com-
plicated examples to come.

if we were to take ti , dening the euclidean sec-
tion (putting the theory at nite temperature), regular-
ity (thermal equilibrium) requires that the period of eu-
clidean time ( =it) the inverse temperature  has
the form:

rotate a to i, as the horizon is a bolt of the killing
vector  + i, the identication  + results [17]
in the identication +i, in addition to the usual
+2.

it is interesting to note that the resulting eld the-
ory stress tensor (obtained using eqn.(6) and discussion
below) can be written in the following form2:

bt ab = a(cid:0)2uaub + ab(cid:1) + bvavb

where ua=(1, 0) is a unit timelike two vector and
va=(1, 1/la/l2) is a null vector, i.e., vbvb=0. the ten-
sor is therefore manifestly traceless. the coecients are:

mation [17]:

where c is the central charge and r is the intrinsic cur-
vature of spacetime, which is zero for the cylinder.
according to the correspondence, the casimir energy
of the dual eld theory3 is the contribution to the mass
of spacetime m which is independent of the black hole
parameter, m , and is given by

given the standard result [25] for the relationship be-
tween the central charge of the conformal eld theory
and gravity in ads3, c=3l/2g, we see that this trans-
lates into a vacuum energy c/(12l) for the theory on the
cylinder. this is consistent with the interpretation [26]
of the spacetime (7), with m =0, as the neveu-schwarz
neveu-schwarz vacuum of the holographically dual super
conformal eld theory: the fermions have antiperiodic
boundary conditions as they go once around the cylin-
der, preventing their zeropoint energy from cancelling
that of the bosons, as happens in the ramondramond
sector.

iii. kerrads4

the kerrads4 metric has the following form [27]

3in higher dimensions, connections between energy of a
spacetime solution and casimir energy of a dual eld theory
were rst pointed out in ref. [24].

(31)

with the angular velocity of the horizon given by
eqn. (12). here, r+ is the location of the horizon, the
largest root of r. again, after continuing ai, eu-
clidean regularity gives  a period +i, in addition
to the usual +2.

the area of the horizon is

a = 4(cid:18) r2

+ + a2

 (cid:19) .

(32)

the nonvanishing components of the kerrads4
stress tensor for large r exactly match the components re-
cently computed for the kerrnewmanads4 case in ref.
[13] in the limit where the charges vanish (i.e., their z0)
and are

(39)

converting with the conformal factor and taking the
limit r   (see (6)), we nd that the stress tensor of
the eld theory has this simple form:

(40)

m

8l2(cid:2)3uaub + ab(cid:3)

bt ab =

where ua=(1, 0, 0). this is the standard form for the
stress tensor of the nonrotating theory 2+1 dimensional
conformal eld theory! the tensor is covariantly con-
served and manifestly traceless, the latter result being
consistent with the absence of a conformal anomaly in
odd dimensional spacetime. it is interesting to note that
the tensor can be written in such a simple form for this
theory, even in the presence of rotation, in contrast to
the case in two dimensions (see eqn.(17)), and as we will
see, the four dimensional case.

the action calculation in this case gives the result:

i4 = 

g(3r4

+ + a2)(r2

(r2
+/l2 + r2

+ + a2r2

+/l2  1)

+/l2  a2)

,

(41)

which agrees with action calculation using the back-
ground subtraction technique in ref.
[17], since the
casimir energy is zero for an odd dimensional eld
theory.
also it agrees with the action for kerr
newmann [13] in the limit where the charges vanish.
these quantities also satisfy the rst law (i.e., eqn.(23)
with n=3.)

iv. kerrads5

in general has

time the inverse temperature is

with the angular velocity of the horizon given again by
eqn. (12). again, r+ is the location of the horizon, the
largest root of r, and  has period +i, in addi-
tion to the usual +2.
in ref. [17] the calculation for the relevant physical
quantities was carried out using the subtraction tech-
nique. the reference spacetime in those calculations
was the spacetime with m =0, i.e., ads5 in very non
standard coordinates. here, we go some steps further,
by computing and studying physics intrinsic to the kerr
ads5 spacetime with no reference to a background, al-
lowing us to extract physical quantities like the casimir
energy and other interesting features of the stress tensor,
as we shall see.

after computation, we get the following nonvanishing

removing the factor r2/l2 (dening the metric ab)
gives the line element of the spacetime (with coordinates
(t, , , )) upon which our conformal eld theory resides,
and for which we must compute the energymomentum
tensor in order to compare to the gravity computation.
this seems at rst a daunting prospect, until one notices
by direct computation that the weyl tensor vanishes for
this spacetime, showing that it is conformally at. this
indeed follows from the fact [17] that the spacetime (42),
with m = 0, is actually just ads5 in nonstandard coor-
dinates, and so its boundary shares some of the conformal
properties of the boundary of ads5.

one can therefore use the following general expression
from ref. [20] to calculate the stress tensor of a eld theory
dened on conformally at spacetime in four dimensions:

where h b

(there, they use spacetime indices (, ) for the eld the-
ory while here we use (a, b)). the label s{0, 1/2, 1} dis-
tinguishes the spin of the eld for which the labelled co-
ecients s and s are computed. we can now compare
this to the the nonthermal (i.e., the m independent)
part of the tensor which we have computed on the grav-
ity side.

according to the ads/cft holographic relation, one
should dene the casimir energy for the eld theory dual
to the kerrads spacetime as the contribution to the to-
tal energy of the spacetime (46) which is independent of
the black holes mass. this is given by

l2(a4/l4 + 9)

96 g

.

e =

(51)

in the limit a0 this reduces to the casimir energy of
the nonrotating black hole discussed in ref. [6].
now we would like to show that the expression in
eqn. (51) exactly matches the energy of the n =4 super-
symmetric u (n ) yangmills theory dened on a rotat-
ing einstein universe, which is the cft on the boundary.

spin half particle is the weyl fermion. substituting in
the values for (ns, s, s), we nd that the resulting en-
ergy of the cft exactly matches the prediction (53) for
the casimir energy from gravity.

b. conformal anomaly

if we expand the the trace of quasilocal stress tensor on
the gravity side in powers of 1/r, the leading contribution
is

t a
a = 

a2l
8gr4 [a2/l2(3 cos4   2 cos2 )  cos 2]
r6(cid:19) .

+o(cid:18) 1

(56)

using the relation eqn. (52) between the gravitational
parameters and the gauge theory parameters and taking
the large r limit, one gets a prediction for the eld theory
quantity:

bt a

a = 

n 2a2
42l6 [a2/l2(3 cos4   2 cos2 )  cos 2] .

(57)

this precisely matches what one obtains by performing
directly the trace of the stresstensor dened for the eld
theory in eqn.(50).

as a nal check, we note that the general form of the
conformal anomaly in four dimensions (adapted to the
present case [29,6]) is given by

a =

where rab and r are the ricci tensor and scalar for the
spacetime upon which the eld theory resides. using the
boundary metric ab, we nd that this is precisely the
result obtained in eqn.(57).

we nd that the stresstensor for the cft on the ro-
tating static einstein universe may be written in the fol-
lowing form:

is the only one which depends upon the thermal part of
the theory represented by the black hole mass while
the other coecients, referring to the null vectors, are in-
dependent of m . it is also interesting to note that when
a0, while c and d vanish, the terms involving b and
e cancel each other.
the last term in the energymomentum tensor (59)
appears to imply the presence of a conformal anomaly,
which is certainly interesting. general considerations
(see e.g., ref. [29] for a discussion in the present con-
text) show that in the presence of a conformal anomaly,
the action has a divergent piece

idiv  log(r/l)z d4x bt a

a .

(62)

(see ref. [7] for specic examples in this context.) from
reading ref. [30], however, one expects that the corre-
sponding logarithmic (uv) divergence (log(r/l)) of the
action should not be present for a spacetime which can
be written locally as a product. in support of this, the
action (47) which we computed does not have a loga-
rithm (in contrast to the examples in ref. [7]), as we have
seen, presenting us with a paradox. this is resolved upon
realization that the integrated trace actually does van-
ish, as a computation reveals4. if this alone were true,
it would provide a counterexample [31,32] to the often
quoted folklore that, in a nontrivial theory, scale in-
variance (preserved here) implies conformal invariance,
which is apparently broken here5.

unfortunately, this is not the case. a rst clue that a
manifestly conformally invariant form for the stress ten-
sor can be restored is suggested by the fact [17] that the
rotating einstein universe is conformal (up to an identi-
cation on the angular coordinates) to the static einstein
universe after a change of coordinates. furthermore, a
a re-
veals that it is not only a total derivative, but it is in
fact proportional to r. since a term proportional to
r results from a variation of

closer examination of the expression for the trace bt a

ict =

(63)

notice again, just as we saw in lower dimensions, that the
coecient, a, of the part of the tensor in standard form

we can therefore supplement the counterterms (3) with
such a term, and dene a new6 stress tensor ab which

4we are grateful to r. c. myers for a crucial discussion, and
for pointing out the vanishing.

5we thank p. townsend for pointing this out, and n. seiberg

and j. polchinski for discussions of this issue.
6in order to dene ab with a suitably modied version of
expression (4), we need to subtract an improvement term,
in the sense of refs. [33,32] which we will report on elsewhere
[34].

is actually traceless for =1/864. our stress tensor ab

also has the same energy and angular momentum as bt ab.

this addition of a new counterterm which amounts
to a new regularisation scheme in order to ensure a
manifestly conformally invariant form for the stress ten-
sor (which is not necessary when there is no rotation in
ads5), is an example of a fact familiar from eld the-
ory: there is an ambiguity of the denition of the trace
anomaly (58) in four dimensions, allowing a term propor-
tional to r to be added, with an undetermined coe-
cient corresponding to the choice of dierent schemes for
regularising the eld theory [20]. here, this corresponds
to dierent choices for boundary counterterms [6]. it is
interesting that a new counterterm is needed to restore
manifest conformal invariance after a change of variables
and conformal frame. this merits further investigation.
overall, we see that the gravity computation (which is
dual to a computation in strongly coupled eld theory)
again matches the results from the weakly coupled eld
theory computation. in the case of pure ads5, the reason
for the precise match, as explained in ref. [6], is that pure
ads5 receives no stringy corrections because all tensors
(in terms of which the stringy corrections can be written)
that can modify einsteins eld equations vanish for that
space. this translates into no dierence between the re-
sults for strong and weak coupling eld theory, because
the stringy corrections are correlated with corrections in
eld theory coupling, as required by the duality [1].

that this is also true for the kerrads5 case, in the
limit of zero black hole mass where we have shown
full agreement with eld theory follows simply because
m =0 kerrads5 is just ads5 in nonstandard coordi-
nates [17], parameterised by a. it therefore shares many
of the conformal properties with ads5. as the stringy
corrections can all be written in terms of the weyl ten-
sor of the spacetime, if they vanish for ads5, they vanish
here also.

v. concluding remarks

the counterterm subtraction technique has allowed for
the intrinsic denition of the action (and the quanti-
ties which follow) for the kerradsn+1 spacetimes, for
n=2, 3, 4. this is in contrast to the background subtrac-
tion technique, which required a reference spacetime in
order to compute a nite action. in subtracting the con-
tribution from a reference spacetime to get a nite action,
any physics common to both spacetimes is lost. in this
paper we have computed examples of such quantities, the
casimir energies and conformal anomaly for eld theories
residing on even dimensional spacetimes.

we have shown that the quantities thus computed (and
indeed, the full stressenergymomentum tensor in four
dimensions) are consistent with a holographic interpre-
tation of the physics of gravity in ads in terms of dual
conformal eld theory. the casimir energies which we

computed for the holographically dual two and four di-
mensional conformal eld theories (residing on a rotat-
ing cylinder, or the rotating einstein universe) exactly
matched the contribution to the energy computed for
the kerrads spacetime which is not attributable to the
black hole. also, we saw an interesting example of the
change in regularisation scheme needed to retain a mani-
festly conformally invariant form in the four dimensional
case. in all cases (n=2, 3, 4) we found that the stress ten-
sor for the eld theory on the rotating spacetime can be
neatly written in terms of a sum of a standard traceless
thermal form (involving the mass of the dual black hole)
and additional terms involving null vectors. intriguingly,
for n=3, there are no such additional terms; its stress
tensor keeps the simple thermal form. this may be an
important feature of the m2brane worldvolume confor-
mal eld theory [35,36]. while the computation for the
two dimensional conformal eld theory and the related
ads3 spacetime is essentially contained in ref. [6], the
results for higher dimensions are new.

we expect that these results also follow for kerr
adsn+1, for n+1>5. it would be especially interesting to
see the form of the tensor for kerrads7. however, we
found that the computational complexities encountered
due to the odiagonal terms in the metric and the
additional counterterms needed [7] were too severe to
allow for an exploration using the techniques which we
have employed so far.
