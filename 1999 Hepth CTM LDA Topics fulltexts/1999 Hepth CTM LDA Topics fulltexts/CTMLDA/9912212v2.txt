abstract

we introduce a notion of q-algebra that can be con-
sidered as a generalization of the notion of q-manifold (a
supermanifold equipped with an odd vector eld obeying
{q, q} = 0). we develop the theory of connections on
modules over q-algebras and prove a general duality the-
orem for gauge theories on such modules. this theorem
contains as a simplest case so(d, d, z)-duality of gauge
theories on noncommutative tori.

it was shown recently that noncommutative geometry is quite useful
in the study of string theory/m-theory (see [4]-[10] and references
therein).
it was proved ,in particular, that the gauge theory on
noncommutative tori has so(d, d, z) duality group, closely related
to t-duality in string theory [5]. the goal of present paper is to
derive a very general duality theorem, containing so(d, d, z)-duality
as a special case. this theorem is formulated and proved in the
framework of noncommutative supergeometry. the main idea of
noncommutative geometry is to consider every associative algebra
as an algebra of functions on noncommutative space. of course,
supergeometry ts very nicely in this approach: one of the most
convenient denitions of a supermanifold is formulated in terms of
the algebra of functions on it. one can say that supergeometry is
supercommutative z2-graded noncommutative geometry.

one of important notions of supergeometry is the notion of q-
manifold (of a manifold equipped with an odd vector eld q satis-
fying {q, q} = 0);see [12]. the rst order dierential operator q

corresponding to q obeys q2 = 0; therefore the algebra of functions
on a q-manifold can be considered as a dierential z2-graded asso-
ciative algebra and it is naturally to think that dierential z2-graded
associative algebras are analogs of q-manifolds. however, in this pa-
per we introduce another notion, the notion of q-algebra, that also
can be considered as a natural generalization of q-manifold and that
can be used to develop the theory of connections and to prove a gen-
eral duality theorem. namely, we dene a q-algebra as a z2-graded
associative algebra  equipped with an odd derivation q obeying
q2a = [, a]; here    should satisfy q = 0.(one says that a
linear operator acting on graded algebra is a derivation, if it satises
the graded leibniz rule.) of course, in the case when  is supercom-
mutative this denition coincides with the denition of dierential
algebra, but if we do not assume supercommutativity this denition
is more general. we dene a connection on -module e as a map
 : e  e obeying the leibniz rule (ea) = e  a + (1)deg ee  qa;
the general duality theorem is formulated in terms of such connec-
tions. we analyze the relation of the standard denition of connec-
tion in noncommutative geometry to our one. it seems that many
well known constructions and theorems become more transparent in
our formalism. from the other side many considerations of present
paper are similar to arguments employed previously, especially in
[1], [2], [3].

preliminaries.

when we talk about associative algebra  we always have in mind
graded (z-graded or z2-graded) unital associative algebra over c.
graded commutator is dened by the formula

[a, b] = ab  (1)deg adeg bba.

in what follows all commutators are understood as graded commu-
tators.

a (right) module e over  is a graded vector space with operator
of multiplication on elements of  from the right; this operation
should have standard properties: (ea)  b = e  (ab) e(a + b) = ea + eb
etc. grading on e should be compatible with grading on  (i.e.
deg(ea) = deg e + deg a). the denition of a left module is similar;
by default our modules are right modules.

a vector space e is called an (1, 2)-bimodule if it is a left 1-
module and a right 2-module; we require that (a1e)a2 = a1(ea2)

2

where ai  i, e  e.

if e1, e2 are -modules we dene an -homomorphism as a map
 : e1  e2 obeying (xa) = (x)a. the graded algebra of -
homomorphisms of the -module e into itself (algebra of -endomorphisms)
is denoted by ende. if e is an (1, 2)-bimodule there exist nat-
ural homomorphisms 1  end2e and 2  end1e.

if e1 is a right -module and e2 is a left -module we dene
e1 e2 as a vector space obtained from the standard tensor product
e1 c e2 by means of identication e1a  e2  e1  ae2, where
ei  ei, a  .

we say that (1, 2)-bimodule p1 and (2, 1)-bimodule p2 are
morita equivalence bimodules if p1 2 p2 is isomorphic to 1 as
(1, 1)-bimodule and p2 1 p1 is isomorphic to 2 as (2, 2)-
bimodule. if such bimodules p1, p2 exist we say that 1 and 2 are
morita equivalent. for every 1-module we can dene an 2-module
e = e 1 p1. applying an analogous construction to 2-module
e and bimodule p2 we obtain an inverse map: e = e 2 p2. one
can say that morita equivalent algebras have equivalent categories
of modules.

a (nitely generated) free module n over  can be dened as the
space of column vector with entries from  and with componentwise
multiplication on elements of . we regard n as a right module,
but it can be considered also as (, )-bimodule. (we already used
the structure of (, )-bimodule on 1 = .) the algebra endn
of endomorphisms of n can be identied the algebra matn of nn
matrices with entries from ; these matrices act on n by means of
multiplication from the left. a projective -module can be dened
as a direct summand e in a free module n. the decomposition
n = e + e  into a direct sum determines an endomorphism e :
n  n projecting n onto e; in other words e2 = e,
ex = x
ex = 0 for x  e . notice that in our terminology
for x  e,
projective modules are always nitely generated.

projective -modules form a semigroup with respect to direct
summation. applying the grothendieck construction to this semi-
group we obtain the k-theory group k0(). more precisely, we
say that a projective module e species an element [e]  k0()
and impose the relation [e1 + e2] = [e1] + [e2]. a c-linear map
 :   c is called a (graded ) trace if it vanishes on all (graded)
commutators:  ([a, b]) = 0 for all a, b  . we always consider

3

graded traces; therefore we almost always omit the word graded
in our formulations.

a trace  on  generates a trace on endn =matn; this trace
will be denoted by the same symbol  . (to calculate the trace of a
matrix (aij) matn one should take the supertrace of the matrix
( (aij)).

if e  n is a projective module then the algebra ende of endo-

morphisms of e can be identied with the subalgebra of endn =matn
consisting of elements of the form eae. (here e : n  n is a pro-
jection of n onto e, a endn). we dene a graded trace  on
ende as a restriction of  to this subalgebra.

if e is an -module, then starting with an element g   and -
homomorphism f : e   we can construct an endomorphism gf :
e  e transforming x  e into gf (x)  e. (the endomorphism gf
can be considered as a generalization of linear operator of rank 1.)
for any algebra  we construct a vector space  = /[, ]
factorizing the vector space  with respect to the subspace [, ]
spanned by all (graded) commutators [a, b]. this construction is
closely related with the notion of trace: traces on  correspond to
linear functionals on .

if e is a projective -module, one can construct a c-linear map
tr: ende   transforming an endomorphism of the form g  f
into the class f (g)   of f (g)  . (such a c-linear map is unique
because in the case of projective module every endomorphism can
be represented as a nite sum of endomorphisms of the form g  f .)
the map tr has the main property of trace

tr[, ] = 0

(trace of graded commutator of two -endomorphisms ,   ende
vanishes). in some sense the map tr:ende   can be consid-
ered as universal trace on ende. (as we mentioned every trace
 on  determines a trace  on ende.
it is easy to verify that
 () =  (tr).)

q-algebras

denition. let  be a graded associative algebra. we say the
 is a q-algebra if it is equipped with derivation q of degree 1 and
there exists an element   2 satisfying

q2x = [, x]

(1)

4

for all x  .

calculating q3x in two ways we obtain

q3x = q([, x]) = q  x +   qx  qx    x  q  (1)deg x (2)

q3x = q2  qx = [, qx] =   qx  qx  .

(3)

we see that q  x = x  q  (1) degx, i.e.

[q, x] = 0

we proved that q  3 commutes with all elements of  (in the
sense of superalgebra). in almost all interesting cases it follows from
this condition that q vanishes.

we will include the additional condition

q = 0

in the denition of q-algebra.

we always consider unital algebras. it is easy to to check that
applying q to the unit we get 0. (this follows from the leibniz
rule.)

let us consider a (graded) -module e. we dene a connection
on e as a c-linear operator  : e  e having degree 1 and obeying
the leibniz rule:

(xa) = (x)  a + (1)deg x  x  qa.

(4)

for all x  e, a  .

let us introduce the notation

ax = (1)deg xdeg axa

the formula (4) can be rewritten in the form

[, a] = cqa

it is easy to check that some standard statements about connections
remain true in our case. however, the denition of curvature should
be modied.

1) if  is a xed connection on e, then every other connection

has the form

 =  + a

5

where a  end1

e is an arbitrary endomorphism of degree 1.

2) if   ende is an endomorphism then [, ] is also endo-

morphism.

3) the operator 2 +  is an endomorphism: 2 +   end2

e.
this endomorphism is called the curvature of connection ; it is
denoted by f () (or simply by f ). it obeys [, f ] = 0.

to check this statement we represent 2 as 1
[[, ], a] by means of (4) and jacobi identify.

2[, ] and calculate

4) let us dene the operator q : ende  ende by the formula

q = [, ].

it is easy to verify that

q2 = [f, ],

(5)

where f is the curvature of .

it follows from this statement and from qf = [, f ] = 0 that
the algebra ende equipped with the operator q is a q-algebra
with  = f . (one should notice, however, that we can also take
 = f + c, where c is a central element obeying c = 0.)

let us consider an (1, 2)-bimodule p where 1 is a q-algebra
with respect to the operator q1 and 2 is a q-algebra with respect
to the operator q2. we say that an operator p : p  p is a
connection on bimodule p if

p (ax) = (1)deg a  ap (x) + q1a  x

p (xb) = p x  b + (1)deg x  xq2b

for all x  p, a  1, b  2.

in other words, p should be a connection with respect to 1

and with respect to 2 at the same time.

it follows from the above statements that every -module e
equipped with a connection  can be considered as (ende, )-
bimodule and  is a connection on this bimodule.

using an (1, 2)-bimodule p we can assign to every (right )
1-module e a (right) 2-module e taking the tensor product with
p :

e = e 1 p

(6)

(to take the tensor product over 1 we identify ea  p with e  ap in
the standard tensor product e c p . here e  e, p  p, a  1.)

6

if we have a connection p in the bimodule p we can transfer a
connection on e to a connection on e. namely, for every connection
 on e we dene an operator   1 + 1  p on e c p . it is
easy to check that this operator is compatible with identication
ea  p  e  ap and therefore descends to an operator  : e  e.
the operator  can be considered as a connection on 2-module e.
it is easy to relate the curvatures of the connections  and .
we should take into account that correspondence between e and e
is natural, i.e. to every endomorphism   end1e we can assign
e (the map   1 : e c p  e c
an endomorphism   end2
p descends to an endomorphism  : e  e).
in particular, the
curvature f ()  end1e determines an endomorphism ^f () 
e. one can verify that the curvature f ( ) of the connection
end2
 on e can be represented in the form:

f ( ) = ^f () + ,

(7)

where  is a xed element of end2

e .

to verify (7) we notice that

2  1 + 1  1 : e c p  e c p

descends to the endomorphism ^f () : e  e and 2 1 + 1 2
p +
12 descends to f ( ) : e  e. using the relation 11 = 11
we obtain that the map  = f ( )  ^f ()is induced by the map
 = 1   : e c p  e c p where the map  : p  p is given
by the formula

 = 2

p + 1 + 2.

it is easy to check that

  end1p  end2p

(8)

(i.e. (ax) = a(x), (xb) = (x)b for x  p, a  1,
b  2).
to check that  commutes with a  1 we represent it in the form
 = \f1(p ) + 2, where f1(p ) stands for the curvature of p
considered as 1-connection; the representation  = \f2(p ) + 1
should be used to prove that   end2p .

it follows from (8) that  = 1   descends to e and gives an
2-endomorphism . one should notice that these facts are clear
also from the representation  = f ( )  ^f ().

7

to illustrate the above statements we can start with an arbitrary
q-algebra  and arbitrary -module p with connection p . we
consider p as (1, 2)-bimodule, where 1 = endp, 2 = .
(we have seen that 1 = endp is a q-algebra with respect to
the operator q = [p , ] and that p is a connection also with
respect to this q-algebra.)
it follows from our calculations that
f = f2(p ) = 2
p + 2, 1 = f and therefore  = f + 1 = 0.
(we can obtain the same result noticing that f1(2) = 2
p + 1 =
(f  1 = 2.) we see that in our situation  = 0; hence, f ( ) =
^f (). (however, as we noticed above one can modify the denition
of q-algebra endp adding central element c with c = 0 to 1;
then  6= 0.)

we would like to give conditions when gauge theories on 1-
module e and in 2 -module e are equivalent. to establish such an
equivalence we need (1, 2)-bimodule p  equipped with connection
p . such a bimodule permits us to transfer modules and connec-
tions in opposite direction. if the constructions obtained by means of
p  are inverse to constructions specied by p we say that bimodules
p, p  give morita equivalence of q-algebras 1 and 2 (or that they
are morita equivalence bimodules). of course, this notion general-
izes the standard notion of morita equivalence of associative alge-
bras, when we do not use the operator q and connections. the def-
inition of morita equivalence bimodules can be reformulated in the
following more constructive way. let us suppose that there exist two
bilinear scalar products between p and p  taking values in 1 and
in 2 respectively. we assume that scalar products are 2-invariant
and 1-invariant correspondingly. in other words, we assume that
for p  p, p  p  we have < p, p >1 1, < p, p >2 2 and
< p, p >1=< p, p >1 for   2, < p1, p >2=< p, 1p >2 for
1  1. we require also that

1 < p, p >1 2 =< 1p, p2 >1, 1 < p, p >2 2 =< 1p, p2 >2
(9)
(10)
1  p , i  1, i  2. the scalar products

p1 < p, p >1=< p1, p >2 p, < p, p >2 p

here p, p1  p, p, p
determine maps

1 = p < p, p

1 >1

 : p 2 p   1,  : p  1 p  2.

we can consider p 2 p  and 1 as (1, 1)-bimodules; then it

8

follows from (9), that  is a homomorphism of bimodules; similarly
 is a homomorphism of (2, 2)-bimodules. we require that  and
 be isomorphisms. then

(e 1 p ) 2 p  = e 1 (p 2 p ) = e 1 1 = e

for every 1-module e. this statement together with similar state-
ment for 2-modules gives us one-to-one correspondence between
1-modules and 2-modules (more precisely it gives us equivalence
of categories of 1-modules and 2-modules). to obtain one-to-one
correspondence between connections we should impose additional
requirements

< p p, p >1 + < p, p p >1= q < p, p >1,

(11)

< p p, p >2 + < p, p p >2= q < p, p >2

it follows from our assumptions that the operator

p  1 + 1  p 

on p c p  descends to operator q on p 2 p . using that q1 = 0
we obtain that the operator   1 + 1  q on e c 1 descends to
 on e 1 1 = e. this means that going from 1-connections to
2-connections and back we obtain the original 1-connection. this
fact together with similar statement about 2-connections gives one-
to-one correspondence between 1-connections and 2-connections.
we see that under our conditions we have equivalence between
gauge theories on 1-module e and on 2-module e (duality). we
will describe later how the duality of gauge theories on noncommu-
tative tori can be obtained this way.

let us study connections on projective -modules where  is a

q-algebra.

first of all it is easy to construct a connection on an arbitrary
projective -module e. namely, if e is specied by means of projec-
tion e : n  n (i.e. en = e) we can construct a connection on e
(so called levi-civita connection) by means of the formula d = eqe
where q acts on n componentwise. (the leibniz rule for d follows
from e2 = e and from the leibniz rule for q.) the curvature of the
levi-civita connection is given by the formula:

f = e((qe)2 +   1).

9

for any algebra  we dened a vector space  = /[, ]. if  is a
q-algebra we have q([, ])  [, ]. this means that the operator
q :    descends to an operator q :   . it is easy to check
that q is a dierential: q2 = 0.

now we will dene the chern character of a connection d on a

projective -module e as an element of :

chd = x

q=0

1
q!

trf q

(recall that we dened a map tr : ende   using the formula
tr(g  f ) = f (g). here f : e   is an -homomorphism, g  
and g  f transforms x  e into gf (x)  e. the map a  a
transforms a   into its class a  .)

one can prove the following statements:
1) chd is closed with respect to the dierential q in :

qchd = 0

(12)

2) if d, d are two connections on -module e then chd  chd

is exact with respect to the dierential q:

chd  chd = q(something).

the proof is based on the following lemma:

for every endomorphism   ende we have

tr[d, ] = qtr

(13)

(14)

it is sucient to verify (14) for levi-civita connection d = eqe
(because tr[d  d, ] = 0) and for endomorphisms of the form
 = g  f (because these endomorphisms span ende).

using (14) we deduce (12) from the relation [d, f q] = 0 that

follows immediately from [d, f ] = 0.

to derive (13) we will consider a smooth family d(t) = d +

t(d  d) of connections on e and prove that

d
dt

chd(t) = q(something).

first of all we notice that the curvature f (t) of connection d(t)
obeys

df (t)

dt

= [, d(t)]

10

where  = d  d  ende. we see that

df
dt

= [, d] mod[ , ].

and therefore
df q
dt

= q[, d]f q1 = q[d, f q1] mod[ , ],

dtrf q

dt

= qtr[d, f q1]  q( ).

integrating over t we obtain (13).

in the proof of (13) we assumed that  is equipped with topology
having some properties that permit us to justify the calculations
above. these assumptions are not necessary; it is easy to modify
our consideration to obtain completely algebraic proof (as in [2] for
example).

sometimes it is convenient to reformulate (13) using the notion
of closed trace. we say that a linear functional on  is a closed
trace if it vanishes on (graded) commutators and on elements of the
form qa. it follows from (13) that for a closed trace  the number
 (ch(d)) does not depend on the choice of the connection d on the
module e; it depends only on the k-theory class of the module e.
using the dierential q we can dene the homology h( ) in
the standard way: h( ) = ker q/im q. it follows from (12), (13)
that the chern character species a homomorphism ch: k0() 
h even( ). one can construct also a map k1()  h odd( ); we will
not discuss this construction here.

connections on modules over associative algebras.

the theory of connections on modules over q-algebras can be
considered as a generalization of the theory of connections on asso-
ciative algebras. if a is an associative algebra one can construct a

dierential z-graded algebra (a) = pn0 n(a) (universal dier-
ential graded algebra) in the following way. the vector space n(a)
is is spanned by formal expressions a0da1...dan and da1...dam where
a0, ...an  a, n  0, m  1,   c. the multiplication and the
dierential on (a) are dened by means of leibniz rule and re-
lation d2 = 0. if e is an a-module we dene on (a)-module e 
as a tensor product:e  = e a (a) where (a) is considered as
(a, (a))-bimodule. we can dene a connection on a-module e as

11

a connection of (a)-module e ; this denition is equivalent to the
denition given by connes (see[1]).

in this denition of connection on a-module e the algebra (a)
can be replaced with any dierential extension of the algebra a (with
any dierential graded algebra  that contains a as a subalgebra
of 0). moreover, one can consider any q-extension of a (any q-
algebra  obeying a  0) and dene a connection on a-module
e as a connection on -module e a . it is interesting to notice
that under certain conditions on algebra  any projective -module
e can be represented in the form e a  where e is projective a-
module, a = 0 (see[11]). in particular, this statement is correct if
 = p0kn k (i.e. the degree of an element of  is non-negative

and bounded from above).

if a lie algebra l acts on a by means of innitesimal automor-
phisms (derivations) we can construct a dierential graded algebra
 = (l, a) of cochains of lie algebra l with values in a. the
elements of  can be considered as a-valued functions of anticom-
muting variables c1, ...., cn corresponding to the elements of the basis
1, ..., n  l; the dierential d has the form

d = ()c +

1
2

cc 
f 
c

where f 

 are the structure constants of l in the basis 1, ..., n.

in other words we can describe the vector space (l, a) as a
tensor product (l)  a where l stands the vector space dual to
l and (m) denotes the grassmann algebra generated by vector
space m (as vector space (m) is a direct sum of antisymmetric
tensor powers of m). the grading on (l, a) is dened by means
of the natural grading on (l); if a is a graded algebra one should
take into account also the grading on a.

let us consider in more detail connections on a-module e with
respect to dierential extension  = (l, a). in this case e 0 = ea
0 = e, e 1 = ea1 = ecl. the elements e, e  e,  
 span e, therefore, the connection  : e r  e r+1 is completely
determined by the map  : e 0  e 1 that can be considered as a map
 : e  e  l or as a family of maps x : e  e that depend
linearly on x  l. instead of the family x we can consider n maps
1, ..., n corresponding to the elements of the basis f1, ..., fn of the

12

lie algebra l. these maps obey the leibniz rule

(ea) = e  a + ea

where  stands for the derivation of the algebra a that corresponds
to f  l.

let a be an algebra a of smooth functions on d-dimensional
noncommutative torus (i.e. an algebra of expressions of the form

p cnun, where cn is a c-valued function on a d-dimensional lattice

that vanishes at innity faster than any power and the multiplica-
tion is dened by the formula unum = exp(inm)un+m, where nm
is a bilinear function on the lattice). then it is natural to construct
a dierential extension of a taking as l the lie algebra of deriva-
tions x where xul =< x, l > ul. (we assume that the lattice is
embedded into vector space v . the vector x belongs to the dual
space v  that can be identied with the lie algebra l.) connections
corresponding to this dierential extension of a appear naturally
in the study of toroidal compactications of m(atrix) theory.

let us suppose now that in addition to the action of lie algebra
on a we have a nite group g acting on a and l by means of
automorphisms and that actions of g on a and l are compatible.
(if we denote automorphisms of a and of l corresponding to the
element   g by the same letter  this means that (t (a)) =
(t )  (a) for every   g, t  l,
a  a.) one can dene
in natural way the action of g on the algebra  = (l, a); this
action commutes with the dierential. this means that we can
regard the crossed product   g as a dierential algebra; we have
(  g)0 = 0  g = a  g and therefore the crossed product can
be considered as dierential extension of a  g.

an a  g-module e can be considered as an a-module equipped
with action of the group g that is compatible with the action of g
on a (more precisely we should have (xa) = (x)(a)). as always
a connection on e is dened as a connection  on   g-module

e = e ag (  g).

again this connection is completely determined by the map  :
e 0  e 1 that can be considered as a map

 : e  e ag (1(l, a)  g)

or as a map

 : e  e  l

13

that determines a connection on a-module e and is compatible with
the action of the group g on e and on e  l.

in the case when a is an algebra of functions on noncommutative
torus the connections we obtained are precisely the connections that
arise by compactication of m(atrix) theory on toroidal orbifolds
(see [9],[10]).

conclusion.

in present paper we generalized the theory of connections on
modules over associative algebra. we embedded this theory into
the theory of connections on modules over q-algebras and proved a
general duality theorem in this framework. namely, we proved that
under certain conditions there exists one-to-one correspondence be-
tween connections on modules over one q-algebra and connections
on modules over another q-algebra and found relation between cor-
responding curvatures. more precisely, it follows from our results
that under certain conditions gauge theory constructed by means
of q-algebra  is equivalent to gauge theory corresponding to the
q-algebra ende where e is an -module equipped with a connec-
tion.( we use the fact that every connection determines a structure
of q-algebra on the algebra of endomorphisms.) this theorem can
be applied to many concrete situations; we are planning to give
applications in forthcoming papers.

appendix

dierential algebras,a-algebras and q-algebras.

if  is a q-algebra one can extend it to a dierential algebra
 adjoining new element x obeying x 2 = , a1xa2 = 0 for all
a1, a2  . the dierential on  is dened by the formula d =
q + [x, ] (this construction was used by a.connes [1] ). the
dierential algebra we constructed is equivalent in some sense to
the q-algebra we started with.

one can dene an a-algebra as a vector space v equipped with
multilinear operations mi ; these operations should satisfy some
relations .
( the operations mi determine a derivation of tensor
algebra over v ; the square of this derivation should be equal to

14

zero.) in standard denition of a-algebra one considers operations
mi where the number of arguments i is  1. however, one can
modify the denition including an operation m0 (if the number of
arguments is equal to zero, then the operation is simply a xed
element of v ). using the modied denition one can say that q-
algebra is an a-algebra where all operations with the number of
arguments  3 vanish.
( in standard denition this requirement
leads to dierential algebras.)
