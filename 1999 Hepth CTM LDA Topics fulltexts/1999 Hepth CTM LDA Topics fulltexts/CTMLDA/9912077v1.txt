no-go theorems on gauge-symmetry-deforming interactions of chiral p-forms are reviewed. we consider the
explicit case of p = 4, d = 10 and show that the only symmetry-deforming consistent vertex for a system of one
chiral 4-form and two 2-forms is the one that occurs in the type iib supergravity lagrangian. article based on
a talk given by m. h. at the conference constrained dynamics and quantum gravity 99 held in villasimius
(sardinia), september 13-17 1999, to appear in the proceedings of the meeting (nucl. phys. b proc. suppl.).

1. introduction

chiral p-forms, which can be dened in (2p+2)-
dimensional minkowski spacetime for any even
p, have the puzzling feature of not admitting
a simple, manifestly covariant action princi-
ple even though their equations of motion are
lorentz-invariant, and even though one can de-
ne poincare generators that appropriately close
according to the poincare algebra. the case p = 0
(chiral bosons) arises in one formulation of the
heterotic string, while the cases p = 2 and p = 4
are relevant to the m -theory 5-brane and type
iib-supergravity, respectively.

although there is no simple, manifestly covari-
ant action principle, there exists a non-manifestly
covariant lagrangian, which is quadratic in the
elds in the free case and which yields the correct
dynamics [1]. there exists also a non-polynomial,
manifestly covariant action [2]. the two formula-
tions are equivalent since one goes from the sec-
ond one to the rst one by appropriately gauge-
xing the auxiliary pure gauge eld introduced in
[2].

in a recent paper [3], we have shown that the

local interactions of chiral p-forms are severely
constrained by the consistency requirement that
they should not modify the number of physical
degrees of freedom. more precisely, if one imposes
that the deformed action (free action + interac-
tion terms) be invariant under a deformed set of
local gauge symmetries that continously reduce
to the gauge symmetries of the free theory as the
coupling goes to zero, one nds in fact that no
consistent interaction can deform the gauge sym-
metry at all. the gauge transformations must
retain their original form under consistent defor-
mations of the action. there is in particular no
analog of the non-abelian yang-mills construction
for chiral p-forms. the only available interactions
must be invariant under the gauge symmetries
of the abelian theory and leave the gauge struc-
ture untouched. this result generalizes to chiral
p-forms the no-go theorems established for non-
chiral p-forms in [48]

motivated by the m-theory 5-brane, we consid-
ered in [3] the explicit case of p = 2. however,
the argument is clearly quite general and applies
to any p. although we used as starting point
the non-manifestly covariant lagrangian of [1],
the same obstructions would be present had we
worked in the pst formalism of [2] because, as

2

we have recalled, one recovers [1] from [2] by ap-
propriately xing the gauge. furthermore, since
the obstructions arise already at the level of the
gauge symmetries (and not lorentz invariance),
they are easily detected in the non-manifestly co-
variant approach.

every no-go theorem has of course the weak-

nesses of its hypotheses. in our case, these are:

1. the deformed action is local

2. the deformation is continuous

3. the system of local elds being dealt with
is a system of n chiral p-forms described in
the free limit by the non-covariant action of
[1] (or the covariant action of [2], see above).
scalar elds or spinor elds are also allowed.

we stress, in particular, that no restriction on the
number n of chiral p-forms was ever imposed.
so, the p-forms can be labelled by any number of
indices. furthermore, no assumption on the order
of the coupling vertices was made; these are not
necessarily cubic, but can be quartic, quintic etc.
accordingly, an interacting theory involving
chiral p-forms with a deformed gauge sym-
metry must be either non-local (which is the
most likely possibility in the m-theory 5-brane
case, perhaps in the context of gerbes [9,10]),
or non-perturbative and non-continuously con-
nected with the free case, or have a richer eld
content.

even this last possibility appears to be rather
restrictive, however, and subject to strong no-go
theorems that forbid a non-abelian deformation
of the chiral p-form gauge symmetries analogous
to the yang-mills deformation. one nds that the
interactions may deform the gauge transforma-
tions but, when they do so, they cannot deform
their algebra (to rst-order in the deformation pa-
rameter). furthermore, those that do deform the
gauge transformations are few in number (if there
is any at all). all other consistent interactions are
again o-shell gauge-invariant under the abelian
gauge symmetry and so do not deform it. we
have not checked the rigidity of the gauge alge-
bra in full generality in the chiral case, but the
study of various explicit examples and the simi-
larity with the non-chiral case where it has been

established [8] make us condent that this rigid-
ity holds in the same manner in the chiral case.
this leaves only the rst two possibilities for non-
abelian deformations.

we illustrate in these proceedings the no-go
theorems on the symmetry-deforming interac-
tions of exterior form gauge elds (involving chi-
ral ones) by considering the system consisting of
a chiral 4-form in ten spacetime dimensions to-
gether with n 2-forms. this is relevant to type
iib-supergravity. we show that the only allowed
symmetry-deforming interactions are in fact pre-
cisely those that appear in the supergravity la-
grangian. there are no others. these interac-
tions deform the gauge transformations of the ex-
terior forms but not their algebra, which remain
abelian.

this case is a good example of the general coho-
mological techniques involved in the calculation
of the deformations.

2. first-order deformations

2.1. free action

we start with the free action

s[aijkl, ba

] = sa + sb

with

sa =

z d10x(

f i1...i5 fi1...i5 )

and

sb = xa

we have set

2  3! z d10xh a

 h a .

fijklm = 5 [iajklm], h a

 = 3 [ba

].

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

the pst manifestly covariant version of the the-
ory may be found in [11,12]. we leave the number
of 2-forms unspecied at this stage. we shall see
that consistency to second-order forces the chiral
4-form to interact with only two 2-forms.

the action is invariant under the following

gauge transformations

,aj1...j4 = 4[j1 j2j3j4]

(5)

and

,ba

 = [a
]

(6)

the invariance of (3) and of the energy-term of
(2) is obvious; the invariance of the kinetic term of
(2) follows from an integration by parts and the
bianchi identity for the curvature fi1...i5 . the
kinetic term behaves thus like a chern-simons
term.

the equations of motion that follow from (1)

are the standard ones for the 2-forms and

4! mf mj1...j4  i1...i5j1...j4 [i1

ai2...i5] = 0

(7)

for the chiral 4-form. from this equation, one
derives

ai1...i4 

1
5!

i1...i4j1...j5 f j1...j5 = 4 [i1ui2i3i4]

(8)

(assuming the 4th betti number of the spatial sec-
tions to vanish). this is the self-duality condition
f = f if one identies the arbitrary functions
ui2i3i4 with the gauge components a0i2i3i4 .

a chiral 4-form and two 2-forms are present
in the spectrum of type iib supergravity in 10
dimensions [1315]. the 4-form signals the pres-
ence of the d3 brane and the two 2-forms cor-
respond to the fundamental string and the d1-
brane, respectively.

2.2. brst dierential

we shall here just outline the general method
and ideas without going into the details. these
will be given in [16].

to determine the possible consistent interac-
tions, we follow the method of [17]. the question
boils down to computing the brst cohomologi-
cal group h 0(s|d) at ghost number zero, i.e., one
must nd the general solution of the cocycle con-
dition

sa + db = 0, gh(a) = 0

(9)

modulo trivial ones (of the form sm + dn). here
s is the brst dierential and d the spacetime
exterior derivative.

the solutions of (9) are expanded according to

the antighost (or antield) number,

a = a0 + a1 +    + ak.

(10)

3

the fact that the expansion stops at a nite order
k follows from the fact a0 contains only a nite
number of derivatives, which already excludes a
weak form of non-locality.

each term in the expansion (10) has total ghost
number zero. the rst term does not involve
the ghosts or the antields. the next terms de-
pend both on the antields and the ghosts, but
in such a way that the antighost number ex-
actly balances the pure ghost number (the higher
i, the more ai
involves antields and hence
also ghosts). the antield-independent term a0
denes the rst-order consistent vertex. the
antield-dependent terms dene the deformation
of the gauge-symmetry and its algebra. in partic-
ular, the term a1, which is linear in the antields
conjugate to the classical elds, denes the defor-
mation of the gauge transformations. similarly,
the term in a2 which is linear in the antields con-
jugate to the rst ghosts and quadratic in those
ghosts, corresponds to the deformation of the
gauge algebra. if this term is absent, the gauge
algebra remains abelian (to rst order) even after
the interaction is switched on. this occurs if the
most general solution of (9) is at most linear in
the ghosts, up to trivial terms that can absorbed
through redenitions. this what happens for the
model at hand.

the brst dierential is explicitly given by s =
 +  where one has, in the 4-form sector with
ghosts cijk, ghosts of ghosts dij, ei and , and
antields aijkl, c ijk, dij , e i, ,

aijkl = 4[icjkl], aijkl = 0
cijk = 3[idjk], cijk = 0
dij = 2[iej], dij = 0
ei = i, ei = 0

 = 0,  = 0

and

aijkl = 4! mf mijkl

 ijklm1 ...m5 [m1

am2...m5],

aijkl = 0
c ijk = mamijk, c ijk = 0,
dij = mc mij, dij = 0,
e i = mdmi, e i = 0,

the ghosts cijk and ghosts of ghosts dij, ei and
 have respectively pure ghost number 1, 2, 3 and
4. the antields aijkl, c ijk, dij , e i and 
have respectively antighost number 1, 2, 3, 4 and
5.

the (total) ghost number gh is the dierence
between the pure ghost number and the antighost
number. the component  and  of s have
(pureghost,antighost) number equal to (0,-1) and
(1,0) respectively. the equation s2 = 0 is equiv-
alent to 2 =  +  = 2 = 0.

2.3. deformations

we assume k > 0 in (10) since when a reduces
to a0, it does not modify the gauge transforma-
tions and there is nothing to be demonstrated.
the idea of the proof is to show that the building
blocks out of which ak can be made for k > 0,
have ghost numbers that cannot generically add
up to zero. thus, there is no or very few ways to
write down an acceptable ak for k > 0.

the building blocks of ak are, on the one hand,
the polynomials in the last ghosts of ghosts a
and  and their temporal derivatives 0, 00,
etc, and, on the other hand, the elements of the
invariant characteristic cohomology hk(|d) or
h(| d), where d is the spatial exterior derivative
dxii. the former have even ghost number, while
the latter generically have odd antighost number.
so, their products generically fail to have total
ghost number zero, with only one exception for
the system under study.

to see this, one follows the argument given in
[3] and one nds that the last term ak in the gen-
eral solution of the cocycle condition (9) can be
assumed to be annihilated by , ak = 0. thus,
it reads

ak = xi

p ii

(28)

(up to trivial terms), where p i is a polynomial in
the curvatures fijklm and h a
 , in the antields,
and in their spacetime derivatives, while the i
form a basis in the algebra of polynomials in the
variables a, , 0, 00, etc, which are the gen-
erators of the cohomology h() in positive ghost
number [the fact that the time derivative of eta
is a generator while the time derivative of sigma
isnt is a consequence from the fact that the 4-
form is treated non-covariantly while the 2 form
is treated covariantly].

the coecient p i of i in the sum (28), which
is a 10-form, is subject to dierent conditions de-
pending on to whether the element i that it mul-
tiplies depends on  and its time derivatives or
not.

1. if i involves at least one time derivatives
of  (including 0
0   ), then the corre-
sponding coecient p i must be of the form
p i = qi dx0 where qi is a spatial 9-form
solution of qi + dn i = 0. here, d is the
spatial exterior derivative, da = dxkka.
however, there is no non-trivial solution to
that equation that would match the ghost
number of i , which is an even number  4
since i contains at least one  or one of
its time derivatives. the only non-trivial
solutions are indeed in antighost number 5,
2 and 1. thus, in this case, one cannot
construct an ak (k > 0) with total ghost
number zero. this is exactly the situation
described in [3] - and is the only case to
be considered for a pure system of chiral p-
forms. note the similarity with the hamil-
tonian analysis of consistent couplings done
in [18].

2. if i depends only on a, the corresponding
coecient p i must be a 10-form that solves

the equation p i + dn i = 0. it must be of
even antighost number to match the even
ghost number of i . there is one possibil-
ity, namely, c h a, where c  is the 7-form
0i1...i6j1j2j3 c j1j2j3 dx0 dxi1 . . .dxi6 . it
has antighost number 2 and can be com-
bined with a to yield a non-trivial a2.
specically - and in density notations -,

a2 = c i1i2i3 h a

i1i2i3 bab

(29)

where ab is a matrix of coupling con-
stants having dimension (length)4. the
matrix ab must be antisymmetric since
i1i2i3 bab = (something)
otherwise h a
+d(something) and a2 can be removed.
this possibility specically requires the
presence of the 2-forms and is not available
for a pure system of chiral forms. besides
c   h a, there is no other non trivial class
in hk(|d) with even antighost number.

since the above a2 is the only possibility, we
carry on the discussion with it. the equation
a2 + a1 + db1 = 0 determines a1 up to a trivial
term,
a1 = ami1i2i3 h a

i1i2i3 b

mab.

(30)

the corresponding interaction vertex a0 is then
found to be
a0 =  12f kmi1i2i3 h a

i1i2i3 bb

i1i2i3 bb

0i0 ab (31)

the term a0 is determined up to vertices that
are gauge-invariant under the abelian gauge-
symmetry (possibly modulo a total derivative).
since these do not modify the gauge transforma-
tions, we do not include them in the sequel and
stick to the choice (31) for a0. this choice has
the smallest number of derivatives.

3. complete action

also a cohomological interpretation [17]. we shall
complete the action in the explicit case where
the rst-order vertex is solely given by the above
deformation a0, without extra gauge-invariant
terms.

the

to discuss

consistency conditions at
second-order, we rst note that the gauge trans-
formation of the eld aijkl
is modied by the
interaction since a contains a piece linear in
ami1i2i3 , from which one reads the new gauge
transformations

,aijkl = 4 [ijkl] + a

[ih b

jkl]ab

(32)

the term a2, linear in the antield c ijk, signals
the corresponding modication of the reducibility
identity. the gauge transformations of ba
 are
unchanged since there is no term proportional to
b 

in a1.

3.2. action

to derive the complete action, it is convenient

to introduce the redened eld strength

fi1...i5 = fi1...i5

bc

[i1i2 h d

i3i4i5]cd

(33)

which has the property of being invariant under
the transformation (32). similarly, one denes

j2j3j4]ab

0j3j4]ab

(34)

which transforms into spatial total derivative,
,d0aj1...j4  [j1fj2j3j4].

by following the recursive construction of [17],
one nds that o(2)-terms must be added to the
action. there is no modication to the gauge
transformations at that order, which remain given
by (32) and ,ba = da. rather than follow-
ing in detail the recursive construction of [17], we
shall give the nal answer. the complete action
takes the form

s[aijkl, ba

] = sa + sb,

(35)

3.1. new gauge symmetries

once the rst-order vertex is determined, one
can analyse the conditions imposed by consis-
tency to second-order. these conditions have

with sa given by
sa = z d10x(

(36)

and sb unchanged.

one easily veries that the complete action is
invariant under the new gauge symmetries pro-
vided the 10-form
a  h bab  h c  h dcd

(37)

vanishes. this condition will be fullled only if
the antisymmetric matrix ab is of rank two. this
is most easily seen by bringing ab to canonical
form,

ab =

where we have assumed an even number of 2-
forms. [in the case of an odd number of 2 forms,
there would be an extra row and an extra column
of zeros, making it clear that the last 2-form
decouples.] only one eigenvalue can be non-zero
in (38): if two are non-zero, say  and , then the
sum (37) contains the term 1  h 2  h 3  h 4,
which is non-zero. thus we see that consistency
to second order imposes that only two 2-forms
couple in fact to the chiral 4-form.
[the term
(37), with a replaced by the ghost a, is a non-
trivial solution of sa + db and so represents a true
obstruction, unless it is zero.]

the action (35) with two 2-forms is the action
for the bosonic sector of type iib-supergravity
(with scalar elds set equal to zero and the metric
equal to  ).

3.3. equations of motion

the equations of motion that follow from vary-
ing the complete action with respect to aijkl are
4! mf mijklm1...m5ijkl[m1d0am2...m5] = 0(39)
assuming as before that the 4th betti number of
the spatial sections is zero, one gets

d0aijkl 

1
5!

ijklm1 ...m5 f m1...m5 = 4 [iujkl].(40)

dening a0ijk to be uijk, one can rewrite (40) as

f =f

where

f = da 

5
2

abba  h b.

(41)

(42)

these are the modied chirality conditions in co-
variant form.

the equations of motion for the 2-forms are, on

the other hand

dh a + 3! 5! abh bf = 0.

(43)

note that one could have derived the ac-
tion (35) by starting from the action describ-
ing a non-chiral 4-form interacting with two
2-forms through chapline-manton and chern-
simons couplings with coecients such that df =
df and making the projection to the chiral sec-
tor through constraints.

3.4. algebra of new gauge transformations
it is easy to verify that the algebra of the new
gauge transformations is abelian. this is because
the new terms involve only the curvatures and no
bare a or ba. thus, the gauge algebra is not
deformed.

4. conclusions

in this paper, we have studied the interactions
for a mixed system containing a chiral 4-form and
n 2-forms in 10 dimensions. we have shown the
uniqueness of the supergravity vertices. any in-
teraction that deforms the gauge transformations
necessarily invoke them. the gauge algebra is,
however, untouched. we stress that this result
has been obtained without invoking supersymme-
try. our analysis illustrates the rigidity of p-form
systems in the local eld-theoretical context, al-
ready well appreciated in the non-chiral case.
