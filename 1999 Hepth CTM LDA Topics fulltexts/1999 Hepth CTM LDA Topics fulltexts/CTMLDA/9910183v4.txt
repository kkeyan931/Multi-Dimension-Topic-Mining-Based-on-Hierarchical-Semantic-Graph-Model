we give a path integral prescription for the pair correlation function of wilson loops lying in the
worldvolume of dbranes in the bosonic open and closed string theory. the results can be applied
both in ordinary at spacetime in the critical dimension d or in the presence of a generic background
for the liouville eld. we compute the potential between heavy nonrelativistic sources in an abelian
gauge theory in relative collinear motion with velocity v=tanh(u), probing length scales down to
r2
min.=2u. we predict a universal (d  2)/r static interaction at short distances. we show that
the velocity dependent corrections to the short distance potential in the bosonic string take the form
of an innite power series in the dimensionless variables z=r2

min./r2, uz/, and u2.

i. introduction

it is an old result due to wilson [1] that the expectation value of the loop observable w (c) in qcd has an eective

description at low energies as a sum over random surfaces with xed boundary:

< w (c) >  (cid:28)tr p exp(iic

dx  a)(cid:29)  zstring[c]

.

(1)

c is the closed world-line of a heavy quarkantiquark pair, the brackets <  > denote the averaging over gauge eld
congurations, and the quarks are treated as semi-classical sources in the gauge theory [1]. zstring[c] denotes the
sum over world-sheets terminating on a xed curve c in spacetime of some string theory: an open string amplitude
with a macroscopic hole in the world-sheet. in the gauge theory, < w (c) >eseff .[c] is characterized by an area
dependence in the eective action for large loops with widely separated quark and antiquark world-lines, with crossover
to a perimeter growth of the eective action for large loops with closely separated world-lines at xed spatial separation
[1]. this behavior is characteristic of the long distance eective dynamics of a large class of phenomenological string
theories including the nambu-goto and eguchi-schild strings [13]. dbrane backgrounds of critical string theory in
at spacetime and at weak coupling [5] enable a universal and quantitative prediction of the short distance dynamics of
wilson loopsa regime of qcd that remains largely unexplored by either analytic or lattice techniques. our result
is extracted directly from a covariant path integral computation for the critical polyakov string with boundaries
[31,6], extending techniques developed in the earlier works [7] [8]. the key ingredient which enables this prediction
is its relationship to the vacuum energy computation in string theory: unlike in quantum eld theories, the one-loop
cosmological constant in critical string theory can be unambiguously normalized, an observation due to polchinski [7].
let us review some aspects of the equivalence in eq. (1) as known from previous work. the leading quantum
correction to the area law from the long distance eective dynamics of the string theory yields an attractive and
model independent 1/r term in the static potential between two heavy sources in the gauge theory. the static
coecient is coupling constant and cuto independent, and was rst discovered using functional methods by luscher,
symanzik, and weisz [9] in a semi-classical quantization of the eguchi-schild string. a model independent argument
based on an eective eld theory governing the quantum dynamics at large distance scales of a thin ux tube linking
the two sources gave the result [10]:

v (r) = r +  


24

(d  2) 

1
r

+ o(1/r2)

,

(2)

where ,  are model-dependent nonuniversal coecients, and d is the number of spacetime degrees of freedom of the
collective coordinate for the thin ux tube. the linear term, signaling connement, dominates at large separations.

the qualitative form of the static potential in eq. (2) has been extensively conrmed in lattice gauge theory analyses
where a high precision measurement of the linear term is easily performed. recent work in string theory [11] has
examined the long distance eective dynamics of wilson loops in certain large n gauge theories using a conjectured
dual description as an eective limit of the type iib string theory in ads spacetimes [12].
in this limit, gravity
decouples from the gauge theory on the dbranes:
for large n, there is a clear separation of scales between the
gauge theory with eective couplings of o(gsn ) and supergravity with couplings of o(gs). the leading gravitational
corrections to the one-loop amplitude we consider are of o(g2
s ), naturally suppressed at short distances and at weak
coupling, even at nite n . on the other hand, the long distance gauge dynamics of wilson loops cannot be directly
explored by open and closed string theory without taking an appropriate large n limit. at long distances, the bosonic
pair correlation function we derive is instead to be interpreted in terms of a dierent low energy theorygravity.
duality alters this interpretation considerably in nonperturbative string/m theory. we defer that discussion to a
consideration of the superstring [13].

the idea of using the polyakov string path integral to extend the analytic estimates for the leading quantum
corrections to the static potential at long distance into the short distance regime is due to alvarez [6]. the implications
of a 1/r term in the short distance potential between sources in a nonabelian gauge theory are discussed in [15].
at short distances, the notion of a thin ux tube no longer holds but a direct computation of the short distance
potential between sources can be performed in a renormalizable string theory with boundaries. unlike the nambu-
goto and eguchi-schild strings, the quantization of the bosonic brink-di vecchia-howe-deser-zumino action [14]
due to polyakov [31] treats the world-sheet metric as an independent dynamical eld. the action is renormalizable,
enabling in principle a closed form analysis of the string functional integral without the need to take an eective
long distance limit. we will carry out that analysis in this paper for critical string theory. we show that dbrane
backgrounds of open and closed string theory in at spacetime and at weak coupling [5] provide a calculable framework
within which the short distance behavior of the static potential can be obtained directly from the weyl invariant string
path integral in the critical spacetime dimension. the results can also be adapted to generic conformally invariant
backgrounds of string theory with cm matter elds coupled to a liouville eld with total central charge equal to the
critical dimension, following [16]. the loops are taken to lie in the p+1 dimensional worldvolume of a dpbranea
hypersurface in a higher dimensional spacetime on which the gauge elds live.
in the nonabelian case each loop
lives in an n index chan-paton state of an open and closed string theory within the worldvolume of n coincident
dpbranes. note that the short distance potential between semi-classical sources lying in the worldvolume of a single
dbrane, or coincident dbranes, is independent of the nonabelian nature of the gauge theory if we neglect interactions:
for free strings, the colorless amplitude will simply scale as n 2 for n coincident dbranes. in what follows, we derive
an expression for the spatial correlation function of a pair of wilson loops lying within the worldvolume of a single
dbrane in a generic at spacetime background of the bosonic open and closed string theory. we extract from this
expression a prediction for the short distance potential between slow moving sources in the worldvolume gauge theory
with small relative velocity, v=tanhuu, and relative position, r. this gives:

.

(3)

v (r, u) = (d  2) 

1

r (cid:2)1 + o(z2) + o(uz/) + o(u2)(cid:3)

the subleading terms in the potential will be obtained in a systematic expansion for small velocities and short distances
valid down to distances of order r2
min.=2u. they are succinctly expressed as a convergent power series in powers
of the dimensionless variables, z=r2
min./r2, uz/, and u2. note that the potential is a quantum eect accounting for
the uctuations about the minimum action surface which determines the saddle point of the string path integral. it
is time reversal invariant [17]: the power series only contains even powers of u. the numerical coecient of the static
term is a measure of the number of degrees of freedom in the theory describing the short distance dynamics. as with
the luscher term in the long distance potential between sources in a gauge theory, the static coecient is free of both
string coupling constant and string cuto dependence. in a theory with supersymmetry, the leading static term will
be absent but there is a corresponding velocity dependent potential [13].

in this paper, we will give a prescription for the pair correlation function of macroscopic loop observables, m (ci),
m (cf ), in bosonic open and closed string theory using a covariant path integral technique for one-loop string ampli-
tudes developed by polchinski [7], which determines unambiguously their normalization. this technique was applied to
the covariant path integral for o-shell closed stringsamplitudes with macroscopic holes in the world-sheet mapped
to xed curves in spacetime, in [8]. explicit results were obtained for pointlike boundary states but an implementa-
tion of boundary reparameterization for nite sized loops directly in the path integral has been lacking so far. we
note that there exists a brst analysis of boundary reparameterization invariance (see, for example, [18]) but brst
methods are unsuitable for addressing issues related to the normalization of the vacuum amplitude. the path integral
implementation of boundary reparameterization invariance we will give is adapted from the work of cohen et al [8],
and also from the earlier works [31,6,7]. we dene the pair correlation function of macroscopic loop observables as
the covariant string path integral:

a reparameterization invariant sum over world-sheets of cylindrical topology terminating on xed boundary curves,
ci, cf , which are taken to lie in the worldvolume of a dpbrane in at spacetime. we will gauge both world-sheet
dieomorphisms and weyl transformations of the world-sheet metric. our results are derived for string theory in
d=26 critical spacetime dimensions although they could be adapted to generic conformally invariant backgrounds
of string theory with cm matter elds coupled to a liouville eld, with total central charge equal to the critical
dimension [16], as outlined in section iiib. s[x, gab] is the bosonic brink-di vecchia-howe-deser-zumino action [14]
plus appropriate bulk and boundary terms as necessary to preserve dieomorphism and weyl invariance. we compute
quantum uctuations about a saddle point describing a surface of minimum action stretched between coplanar loops
of xed length, li, lf , with spatial separation, r. the short distance potential between sources is extracted from
the long loop length limit of this amplitude: li, lf with r held xed.
it should be noted that the one-loop amplitude with macroscopic boundaries is free of any coupling constant
dependence. corrections to the leading term in string perturbation theory are o(gopen) from splitting, and o(gs) and
higher order from open and closed string loops. here gs=g2
open, where gopen is identied with the yang-mills coupling,
and gravitational corrections enter at o(g2
s ) as closed string loopssuppressed at weak coupling. nevertheless, even
in dpbrane backgrounds where the gauge elds live in p<d1 spatial dimensions, evidence for the higher dimensional
string theory in which the gauge elds live is present in the numerical coecient of the leading term in the short
distance potential. the reason is that the world-sheet uctuates in all of the spacetime dimensionsboth parallel
and transverse to the worldvolume of the dbrane. from the viewpoint of a nonabelian gauge theory, the transverse
uctuations arise from scalar elds in the adjoint representation of the gauge group.

we begin in section ii with a discussion of classical boundary reparameterization invariance, explaining its imple-
mentation in the string path integral. a boundary state in the bosonic string is specied by an embedding and an
einbein. for xed embedding of the loops, we give a boundary dieomorphism invariant prescription for the measure
in the path integral, summing over reparameterizations of the boundary. the gauge xed path integral is derived in
detail in section iiia. we determine the normalization of the path integral as in polchinskis analysis of the torus
amplitude in the bosonic string theory [7], extended to string amplitudes with boundaries [6,8,21]. for completeness,
we retain the liouville dynamics although our main interest is in string theory in the critical spacetime dimension.
section iiib is an aside explaining how this analysis can be applied to polyakov strings with generic conformally
invariant backgrounds for the liouville eld following [16]. readers whose main interest is in the potential calculation
for string theory in the critical spacetime dimension can skip this subsection. the modications to the pair correlation
function for generic boundary conditions pertaining to slow-moving sources in relative motion within the worldvolume
of the dbrane is derived in section iiic, an analysis similar to the scattering of slow moving dbranes in the bulk
transverse space [19,20,17].

the computation of the potential between slow moving sources at short distances is given in section iv. we
consider heavy sources in the gauge theory in relative collinear motion with r2=r2+v2 2, v<<1, thus giving a simple
realization of coplanar loops while mimicking nonrelativistic straight line trajectories in the euclideanized x 0, x p
plane. here r is their relative position, and  is the zero mode of the euclideanized time coordinate, x 0. we will
compute the minkowskian potential for two sources in relative collinear motion with nonrelativistic velocity v<<1
for small separations r. in section iva, we extract the short distance potential between two point sources traversing
closed curves in spacetime for small separations r from the large loop length limit of the pair correlation function of
wilson loops. the scattering plane x 0,x p, can be wrapped into a spacetime cylinder by periodically identifying the
coordinate x 0. then the closed world-lines of sources are loops singly wound about this cylinder, where the relative
position of the sources at proper time  is r( ). we identify these closed world lines with wilson loops. dene the
eective potential as follows:

< m (ci)m (cf ) >= i lim

tz +t

t

d ve.[r( ), u]

,

(5)

where we have taken the large loop length limit: lilft, with r held xed. the dominant contribution to
the potential between sources at short distances is from the massless modes in the open string spectrum. restricting
to these modes, we can express the potential as a double expansion in small velocities and short distances [20] with
the result:

v (r, u) = 

tanh(u)/u

r(1 + uz/)1/2 (cid:26)(d  2)

( 1

2 , ( + uz)/z)

( 1

+ o(z2/(1 + uz/)2)(cid:27) ,

where z is a dimensionless scale factor, z=r2
small velocity expansion at short distances [19]: r2

min./r2, and rmin. is the minimum distance that can be probed in the
2 , ( + uz)/z) is the incomplete gamma function.

min.=2u. ( 1

the resummation and systematics of the small velocity expansion are discussed in section iva. the scale factor z
determines the magnitude of the velocity dependent corrections and, therefore, the accuracy of the expansion. for a
given accuracy, with xed z value, we can probe arbitrarily short distances r by simultaneously adjusting the velocity
u. self-consistency of the double expansion implies, however, an upper bound on the relative velocity, uu+, thereby
determining the regime of validity for the small velocity approximation. it should be noted that the leading terms in
the potential can be obtained without use of the small velocity expansion. the potential is universal: independent of
the dimensionality of the higher dimensional dbrane, the geometrical parameters of the loop conguration, and the
string scale cuto. we note that there is no evidence for a departure from analyticity in the form of the potential
between point sources in the bosonic string at short distances. the phase transition found in the large d analysis of
a class of phenomenological string models including the nambu-goto string [22] appears to be a large d artifact.

d0branes are point-like spacetime topological defects present in the generic background of the open and closed
bosonic string theory.
in section ivb, we note that the short distance potential between two static d0branes in
bosonic string theory gives a linear interaction, vd0brane=(d  2)r/2. the static potential is the shift in the
vacuum energy due to a constant background electromagnetic potential, but with vanishing electric eld strength
[5,19,17]. the d0branes are assumed to have xed spatial separation in the direction x d1, and to be in relative
motion with nonrelativistic velocity v in an orthogonal direction x d [19,20,17]. the systematics of the small velocity
short distance double expansion, and the value for the minimum distance probed in the scattering of d0branes, is
identical to the results obtained in section iva in general agreement with previous work.

the bosonic string has a tachyon, formally suppressed in obtaining this result, which must be stabilized in order to
obtain a theory with a sensible ground state (see, for example, the recent discussion in [23]). alternatively, it can be
eliminated from the spectrum of physical states, as is possible in the fermionic type i and type ii string theories [17].
evidence for distance scales in string/m theory shorter than the string scale down to the eleven dimensional planck
length was originally observed in the form of the velocity dependent potential between d0branes in relative motion
in tachyon-free backgrounds of the type ii string theory [19,20,17]. dbranes correspond to bps states in the type
ii supergravity-yang-mills theory, solitons with masses of o( 1
g ). the observation that solitons with masses of order
1/g can probe shorter distance scales than ordinary eld theory solitons is originally due to shenker [24]. our result
illustrates this principle directly in the gauge theory on the worldvolume of a dbrane in the bosonic string. stated
in complete generality for open and closed string theories at weak coupling: a dirichlet boundary, or wilson loop,
can probe distance scales arbitrarily shorter than the string scale, whether in the worldvolume of the dbrane or in
the bulk space orthogonal to the brane. we conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our result in the
broader context of gauge theory in generic backgrounds of string/m theory.

ii. boundary reparameterization invariance

following cohen et al [8], the tree correlation function for a pair of macroscopic string loops can be represented as
a path integral over embeddings and metrics on world-sheets of cylindrical topology terminating on xed curves, ci,
cf , which lie within the worldvolume of a dbrane:

< m (ci)m (cf ) > = z[ci,cf ]

[dg][dx]

v ol[gauge]

esp [x,gab]0r d2g

,

(7)

where sp is the bosonic brink-di vecchia-howe-deser-zumino action [14] on a surface with boundaries terminating
on xed curves. note that the amplitude is free of the string coupling, since the euler characteristic, , equals
zero, and the boundary cosmological constant terms have been eliminated in favor of the bulk term since these are
not independent lagrange multipliers on a surface of cylindrical topology. in this section, we discuss the boundary
conditions on the world-sheet elds which determine the saddle point of the path integral about which we are to
compute quantum uctuations.

begin by considering the boundary conditions on the embedding coordinates. setting the variation of the classical

action with respect to the x m to zero on the boundary yields:

(x m )naaxm|m = 0, m = 0, , d  1 .

(8)

we will require boundary reparameterization invariance of the amplitude: each point on the physical boundary, c, is
identied with a point on the piecewise continuous world-sheet boundary m , but only upto a boundary reparameter-
ization. classically, this is most succinctly expressed as the modied dirichlet boundary condition on the embedding
functions [6]: x |mtaax |m , =0, , p, and zero dirichlet boundary conditions, x m|m =0, m=p + 1, ,
d1 in directions orthogonal to the brane volume. we can replace eq. (8) with the equivalent condition:

4

natbax bx|m = 0,  = 0, , p .

(9)

note that upon imposition of the modied dirichlet boundary condition on all d coordinates of a space-lling
dbrane, the intrinsic world-sheet metric, gab, satises the same classical equation of motion as the embedding metric:
ab=ax m bx m , summing on m =0, , d1. as a consequence, under the mapping of the world-sheet boundary
to xed curves in the worldvolume of the dbrane, classically, the physical length of any closed curve is identied with
the parameter length of a corresponding hole on the string world-sheet.
let 1 be the circle variable parameterizing any hole on the worldsheet, and e=g|m be the einbein on the bound-
ary, with ducial metric g. the metric on an arbitrary surface with cylindrical topology can be brought to the ducial
form, ds2=l2(d1)2+(d2)2, where 011, 021, and the area of the surface equals l. a reparameterization
of the boundary, di m , is a one-to-one invertible mapping of holes on the world-sheet into corresponding xed
curves in spacetime:

 [x(1)|(i,f )] = x(i,f )



[f (i,f )(1)]

0  1  1 ,

(10)

thus, the x(i,f )(1) are ducial maps of the boundaries of the world sheet into the spacetime curves ci, cf , and the
f (i,f ) are arbitrary dieomorphisms of 1 parameterizing the corresponding holes on the worldsheet.

the path integral sums over quantum uctuations about a classical background determined by an extremum of the
action. we look for minimum action congurations in the classical phase space of the polyakov string. we separate
each x into a piece, x, which solves the classical equation of motion with ducial metric, g, and assumes the functional
form x(i,f ) on the boundary, and a quantum uctuation which satises the zero dirichlet condition. in directions
orthogonal to the worldvolume of the dbrane, the x(i,f ) are identically zero. expanding the classical action in a
complete set of modes,

spanning the classical phase space of boundary congurations, gives [8]:

x(i,f )

n =z 1

n  xfn )(cid:3)

since our interest is in the large loop length limitwhere the dynamics is hopefully universal and independent of
the detailed geometric parameters of the loops, we make a judicious guess for minimum action congurations, x(i,f ),
obtaining the saddle point action from eq. (12). a simple case is a pair of circular wilson loops of uniform radius
l/2 separated by a distance r. align the circles parallel to the x p, x 0 plane, with their axis in a perpendicular
direction. here x 0 is a euclidean coordinate. the minimum area world-sheet is a catenoid [25]:

x = (acos(21), asin(21), h(a)),

(13)
with l/2al/2. the radial parameter, a, is related to the height of the catenoid, h(a), by the equation,
a=(l/2)cosh(2h(u)/l). l/2 is the minimum radius of cross-section for the catenoid. it is straightforward to
evaluate the polyakov action for this surface. consider the maps that must be included in the sum over reparame-
terizations of the world-sheet boundary for this conguration of loops. in general, this is a sophisticated problem in
the representation theory of the group di(s1). however, in the large loop length limit, the analysis is rather simple
since winding number one maps with no self-intersections are energetically favored.

fig. 1.

x() is a map from the boundaries of the annulus to a pair of coplanar nested rectangular loops which lie within

the worldvolume of a dbrane.

i=1pk

this feature of the large loop length dynamics is straightforwardly captured by considering the simple problem
of summing over the reparameterizations of loops with one or more marked points. for such maps, the sum over
reparameterizations of the boundary is easily implemented in closed form prior to taking a large loop length limit.
for notational ease, let  denote the circle variable, 1. we consider non-intersecting curves with the following
characteristics: each c(i,f ) is piecewise smooth with k straight line intervals of equal length, s(i,f )
, and k turning
points, or corners, (i,f )
, =1, , k. any curvature on the boundary of the world-sheet, if present, is permitted only
at the corners. as can be seen from the gauss-bonnet theorem, this would induce a non-vanishing euler characteristic,
/2, and consequently a dependence on the string coupling constant in the amplitude.
the angle terms arise from the delta function in the geodesic curvature at the corners. the bulk curvature is however
required to be smooth: this implies that if we consider loop congurations with corners, it is convenient to choose
the loops to be coplanar. for rectangular, or right-angled, loops, the turning angle, (i)
 =/2, for every i, . the
simplest closed loop with net turning angle 2 is a rectangular loop with four edges, k=4. the example shown in
figure 1 is a pair of coplanar nested rectangular loops, with i=2, k=4. the net turning angle for both loops vanishes.
thus, corner=0 for ci, cf , and there is no dependence on the string coupling constant in the pair correlation function.
it should be noted that, in general, the presence of corners would be a violation of boundary weyl invariance giving a
correction to the liouville action [26]. any pair of coplanar nested loops with arbitrary numbers of edges having net
turning angle zero gives a weyl invariant loop conguration with a well-dened saddle conguration: the stretched
world-sheet in the plane containing the loops. smooth loops in this same class are the boundaries of an annulusa
pair of coplanar nested circular loops:



x = ((r0 + r2)cos(21), (r0 + r2)sin(21))

,

(14)

where li=2r0, lf = 2(r0 + r), and r is their separation in the radial direction. periodically identifying euclidean
time, x 0 is the angular, and x p the radial, direction. now take the large loop length limit. comparing with our
discussion of the cylindrical spacetime in the introduction, the circular loops correspond to the closed world-lines of
static sources with xed spatial separation, r. from eq. (12), and in the limit l, we obtain the saddle point
action, sp (x, g)=r2l/4. it is easy to verify an identical result for a pair of coplanar nested right-angled loops
with arbitrary numbers of edges.

iii. macroscopic loop correlation function

we now present the derivation of the closed string amplitude linking xed curves, ci, cf , of length li, lf , in an
embedding spacetime with metric ab=ax bx, and spatial separation r. we perform the sum over world sheet
metrics using an idea taken from cohen et al [8]. we begin with the integration over all embeddings, (x m, x ), with
xed ducial bulk metric, and xed ducial einbeins on the parameter boundary. we choose a ducial metric on
the worldsheet, ds2=gabdadb, with e=g. next we sum over world sheet metric deformations that leave xed the
parameterization of the boundary. finally, we perform an integral over the boundary data, {e(; l(i,f )
)}, summing
=1, , k, for all 2k intervals, restoring boundary reparameterization invariance. this last sum is dened as follows
(see also the related ideas in [27,26]).
a boundary state is specied by an einbein and an embedding function, (e, x). the embedding function is
specied by our choice of saddle conguration, but we wish to leave its parameterization unxed. the sum over
einbeins implements reparameterization invariance on the boundary, and we must divide by the volume of the group
of boundary dieomorphisms, di m . thus, we need a reparameterization invariant measure for the path integration
over einbeins. the unique choice is polyakovs quadratic form for metric deformations [31], restricted to any given
boundary interval. on any interval, a boundary reparameterization di m , acts as:
()] 1    ,  = 1, , k,

 [x|s(i,f )

] = x(i,f )

[f (i,f )

(15)









() is the ducial map of the th interval on the circle into the th interval of the curve c(i,f ), and f (i,f )

where the  are points in the range 0    1, and  varies continuously with 0=0 identied with k=1. thus,
x(i,f )
()

is the corresponding dieomorphism of  on the th interval of the circle. schematically, the path integration over
quantum uctuations due to an arbitrary dieomorphism of the world sheet has been decomposed:



1

order(d)z [dx][dg]

v ol[di]  z [dei (, e)]

v ol[di m ]z[e]

[dg]

v ol[di m ]z[g;e]

[dx]

,

(16)

6

where v ol[di m ] denotes the volume of the group of dieomorphisms vanishing on the boundary, and v ol[di m ] that
of the group of boundary dieomorphisms. we divide by the order of the subgroup of the disconnected component of
the dieomorphism group, d: discrete dieomorphisms of the world-sheet left invariant under the choice of conformal
gauge [7]. thus, a factor of two in the denominator corrects for the two-fold invariance of the measure of the path
integral under the dieomorphism:

this symmetry will be left invariant under the gauge xing of reparameterizations of the world-sheet to be described
below. the measure for embeddings and metrics do not individually respect weyl invariance but, in critical string
theory, their combination is weyl invariant, and we therefore divide through by the volume of the weyl group. in
what follows, we will make this gauge xing procedure explicit.

a. gauge fixing reparameterizations

the gauge xing of world-sheet metrics and the path integration of metrics and embeddings proceeds as in [7],
except that all harmonic functions on the world-sheet, scalars and vectors, (x, a), are orthogonally decomposed
= +. the  vanish on the boundary, and the  are harmonic functions taking values |m =  on the boundary.
the x determine the saddle point conguration as described in the previous section. in general, we will allow for
uctuations of the world-sheet elds on m , subject only to the constraint that they preserve the normal direction to
the brane, the xed embedding of the spacetime curves, and the smoothness condition at any corners of the boundary,
if present. we will assume the reader is familiar with reference [7] and simply assemble the dierent contributions to
the path integral.

begin with the integration over embedding functions with xed ducial world sheet metric. we choose nested
coplanar loops with physical lengths, li, lf , and xed spatial separation, r. for each of the d scalar degrees of
freedom, normalizing the path integration over harmonic functions vanishing on the boundary as in [7,21] gives the
result:

er2l/4

(det0)d/2 = er2l/4

[(

il
2

)]d

,

(18)

where the determinant of the laplacian on scalars is computed with the zero dirichlet boundary condition, and l is
the cylinder modulus dened by the ducial metric, ds2=l2(d1)2+(d2)2, 011, 0 21. with this choice, the
area of the world-sheet is normalized to l.
next consider the integration over metric deformations vanishing on the boundary. as in [31,6,7,21], we isolate the
dependence on symmetric traceless variations of the metric and divide out by the volume of the gauge group [dim ]0,
dieomorphisms of the world-sheet continuously connected to the identity and vanishing on the boundary. normalize
the path integrations on the cylinder as in [7,21]:

z [dg]e|g|2/2 y z [dg]e|g|2

/2 = 1 = jm (, g)z [d]e gz [d]gz 

0

dle|g|2/2

,

(19)

where |g|2 is the quadratic form for metric deformations, and jm (, g) is the jacobian from the change of variables
to deformations of, respectively, the liouville mode, , dieomorphisms, a, vanishing on the boundary, and the
cylinder modulus, l, computed in [7]. the basic assumption underlying eq. (19) is the locality of the measure: the
integral over elements [dg] is a product of integrals over elements [dg] at xed values of the world-sheet coordinate
. the only reparameterization invariant local counterterm (free of derivatives of the world-sheet metric) is of the

form, mr d2g, which can be absorbed in a renormalization of the bulk cosmological constant, 0, present in the

bare action given in eq. (7). thus, the gaussian integral on the left hand side of eq. (19) can be set to unity at the
cost of renormalizing 0 [7]. the same argument applies to any of the world-sheet elds, (a, , x). the nal value
of the renormalized bulk cosmological constant, r, is set to zero at the end of the calculation, giving a manifestly
weyl invariant result for the bosonic string theory in the critical spacetime dimension d=26.

taking into account the contributions of the conformal killing vector and zero modes of the laplacian on vectors,
1, the innity from the integration over dieomorphisms [d]g vanishing on the boundary is cancelled against the
volume of the gauge group [di m ]0. the result is an integral over the cylinder modulus times the quantum functional
integral for liouville eld theory:

jm (, g)z [d]e g esl[,g]sboundary [,e]

,

7

(20)

where sboundary includes any boundary terms necessitated by the world-sheet gauge symmetries. sl[, g] is the
unrenormalized liouville action [31]:

sl[, g] =

with integration norm given by:

.

we will treat the measure for the einbeins following [7,8]. note that the quantum functional integral in eq. (20)
denotes all possible bulk and boundary deformations of the liouville eld. in particular, it receives corrections from
the measure for dieomorphisms on the boundary as is shown below.
we continue with the sum over metric deformations nonvanishing on the boundary, orthogonal to the modes summed
in eq. (19). the metric on the world-sheet is gabe, and the ducial einbein induced on the boundary is e=g. the
length of either boundary in the cylinder metric, r 1
0 de, equals l. a variation of the einbein on the th interval is
the result of a dieomorphism, f (i,f )
{((e + e)[ + f (i,f )

where l(i,f )
is the length of the th interval of the corresponding hole on the worldsheet, and  is a rescaling of the
einbein which can always be absorbed in a shift of the liouville eld on the boundary. the restriction of the quadratic
form for metric deformations to the boundary, m , gives a measure on the tangent space to the space of einbeins on
any given interval:

|e|2 =z d(e(; l))1(e(; l))2 =z d[e()(f )

1 z [de]e|e|2/2 = jm (e)z [df ]g[d]gee|e|2/2

,

(25)

where the jacobian jm is obtained as before, from a change of variables to deformations of boundary dieomorphisms,
f , and einbein rescalings, . since a rescaling of the einbein is absorbed by a shift of the liouville eld we can, with
no loss of generality, set =0. consequently, the integration over [d] can be consistently dropped from the path
integral. the innity from the integration over dieomorphisms will be cancelled by the volume of the gauge group
of dieomorphisms on the boundary, di m , which has no disconnected part. combining this analysis of boundary
deformations with the bulk deformations in eq. ( 19), we can write:

(a/2)1/2(detabab)1/2(det1)1/2

(detqab/2)1/2

the factor in square brackets is the jacobian, jm , derived in [7]. a is the world-sheet area, a=r d2g, and the

term in the denominator arises from conformal killing vectors, if present. on the cylinder, the area, a=l, in the

rescalings of the ducial einbein must be absorbed in a shift of the liouville eld on the boundary in order that the conformal
class of the metric is left unchanged.

the second term in eq. (26) is the boundary jacobian, jm , the product of independent determinants for each of
, =1, , k. note that the dieomorphism acts on each circle as a whole, but independently on each

k intervals, si
of the two boundaries. since the boundaries have a common parameter length, l, we obtain:

jm = det[

a similar path integration appears in the problem of obtaining the o-shell propagator for a relativistic point particle,
a discussion of which appears in reference [8]. see, also, the ansatz for a scalar quark loop given in [27].

assembling eqs. (16), (18), (20), (21), and (26), our result for the pair correlation function of piecewise smooth

macroscopic loops, ci, cf , at xed separation, r, is:

where s[; g]=sl[; g]+sboundary is the action for the liouville eld including boundary terms. in the critical space-
time dimension, d=26, the liouville dynamics entirely decouples, and we can consistently set  to zero in eq. (29)
while dividing out by the volume of the weyl group.

b. generic liouville backgrounds

it is possible to consider the cases cmatter<25 following the method in [16]. we require that the path integral
expression for the loop correlation function preserve quantum conformal invariance. we begin by suppressing quantum
uctuations and restrict to the zero mode, 0, noting that the classical equation of motion is that of a free scalar
eld in the regime 0: the exponential potential is suppressed. we will preserve this asymptotic property in
dening the quantum theory: the wavefunctions (operators) of liouville conformal eld theory are required to match
smoothly to free eld states in the 0 regime, characterized by momentum and occupation number alone.
r, with conformally invariant free eld norm:

quantum liouville conformal eld theory can be dened by a functional integral over a renormalized liouville eld,

the ansatz of [16] is that the eects of renormalization can be lumped in the potential, leaving a kinetic term for r
with the canonical normalization of a free scalar eld theory. thus, we write:

|r|2 =z d2pg(r)2

.

(30)

z [d]e g esl[,g]+sboundary [,e] =z [d]gz 



d0 es[r,g]

,

(31)

where, s[r], includes all possible renormalizable terms in the bulk, and on the boundary, that preserve both dif-
feomorphism and weyl invariance. note that a corner anomaly is a spontaneous breaking of weyl invariance on the
boundary, contributing an additional term not included in s[r, g].

in a weyl invariant theory, the renormalized action s[r, g] takes the general form:

s[r, g] =

,

d2pger

(32)

where q, , and (i), are constants determined by the requirement [16] that every term in eq. (32) be a dimension
one primary eld, in a conformal eld theory of vanishing total central charge: cm+c+cghosts=0. the renormalized

9

bulk and boundary cosmological constants, r, (i)
r are arbitrary marginal couplings in the conformal eld theory.
with no loss of generality, we could set the boundary cosmological constant term on the cylinder to zero, retaining
r.

the only mode of r that survives on the boundary is 0, and the modes r satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions

as in [68,21]. then, conformal invariance requires:

q =r cm  25

3

,  = (cm  1  cm  25)/23

,

(33)

the upper sign matching the dimension of the cosmological constant operator as computed in a semi-classical cm
saddle point evaluation of the path integral for the liouville eld  [27,16]. we will not pursue these cases further
since our main interest in this paper is string theory in the critical spacetime dimension which corresponds to the
theory with cm=25, cr=1.

c. generic boundary conditions

following [19,20], it is an easy extension to compute the pair correlation function with boundary conditions per-
taining to closed world lines for a pair of slow moving sources in relative motion. consider a pair of coplanar nested
rectangular loops with the plane of the loops aligned parallel to the (x 0, x p) plane. x 0, x p are both euclidean
coordinates. let us rotate one of the loops relative to the other through an angle  in the (x 0,x p) plane, and take
the large loop length limit: li  lf  t, with r held xed. upon analytic continuation, x 0ix 0
m , the loops
may be interpreted as the closed world-lines of slow moving scalar quarks in collinear motion at short distances r and
with relative velocity v=tanh(i)<<1.
consider the boundary conditions on x 0, x p. we leave the boundary conditions at one end-point xed, and change
the condition at the other end-point to: x p|cf =vx 0. parameterize the world sheet with open string endpoints 2=0,1
at boundaries, ci, cf , respectively, and an open string loop parameterized, 011. recall that 1 is identied with
the ducial circle variable  dened in the previous section. a complete set of eigenfunctions of the scalar laplacian
is composed from the basis:

(n1,n2) = e2n1i1
()

sin([n2 + ]2)

,

(34)

where  takes values: iu/, or 1+iu/. the velocity has been parameterized as v=tanhu and we work in the small
velocity approximation with vu. the remaining d2 embedding coordinates satisfy the zero dirichlet boundary
condition as in section iiia. the functional determinant of 0 takes the form:

iv. short distance potential between sources

we will now compute the potential between heavy nonrelativistic sources in the gauge theory in relative collinear
motion with velocity v=tanhuu. parameterize the closed world-lines of the sources by the proper time variable,  ,
the zero mode of the euclidean embedding coordinate x 0. let r( )2=r2+v2 2 denote the relative coordinate of the
two sources in the x 0, x p plane, where r is their static separation. we express the amplitude as an integral over
minkowskian time, i . the loops are identied with the closed world-lines of a heavy quark-antiquark pair in the
gauge theory. this computation is described in section iva. we emphasize that the open string theory results derived
in section iva are only to be applied to the short distance limit of the potential between heavy sources in the gauge
theory.

d0branes are point-like spacetime topological defects in the bosonic string theory [17]. following [19,20,17], in
section ivb we compute the short distance interaction between two d0branes in the bosonic string theory obtaining
a linear repulsive static interaction. the systematics of the small velocity and short distance double expansion yields
similar conclusions for the minimum distance as in section iva.

a. wilson loops and a short distance 1/r potential

we dene the potential between sources traversing xed worldlines, ve.[r( ), u], as follows:

<  >= iz t /2

and take the limit t, with r held xed. then,

in the limit of short distances, the amplitude is dominated by the exchange of the lowest lying modes in the open
string mass spectrum. we therefore expand in powers of e2l, organizing the integrand as an innite summation
over open string modes, and restrict to the lowest lying states. we suppress the leading contribution from the open
string tachyonabsent in any stable background, and focus on the subleading contribution from massless open string

11

modes. we will show that the short distance potential between sources in the bosonic string analogous in some
respects to a nonsupersymmetric background of the superstring, has a static remnant originating in the massless
modes, a measure of the degrees of freedom determining the short distance dynamics of wilson loops. consider,

we will now assume small velocities and short distances, performing a double expansion in the variables r, u. the
regime of validity for the small u expansion is determined by the behavior of the cosecant function. we can perform
a taylor expansion in the rst half-period of its argument, 0ul<. consider the corrections to this result from the
integration domain ul. the sine function changes sign at every n, nz+, so that the regions, n, where the
integrand is singular can be excised from the domain of integration. this leaves the intervals: n+ul(n + 1).
for suciently small u values the oscillations in the integrand will be increasingly rapid, smearing out the integral
[17]. the result can always be bounded, or evaluated by numerical integration, as a self-consistency check on the
validity of the small velocity short distance approximation. this check provides an upper limit, u+, on the permissible
velocities. with this restriction, the contribution from the domain l>/u+ can be dropped and we will suppress it in
what follows. upon taylor expansion of the periodic functions in the integrand, the potential can therefore be written
as:

v (r, u) = 2(82)1/2z /u+

and the b2k are the bernoulli numbers. integrating over l gives a systematic expansion for the potential in powers
of u2/r4. let us dene a dimensionless scaling variable, z=r2
min.=2u. the velocity dependent
corrections to the potential are succinctly expressed as convergent power series in the dimensionless variables, z,

the (, ( + uz)/z) are incomplete gamma functions. in writing eq. (48) we have assumed u/u+<<1. note that if
the variable z is taken to zero, for distances r2>>r2
min., we recover the ordinary gamma functions, (). the potential
has a static remnant in the bosonic string. setting u to zero in eq. (48) gives the simple result:

(49)

where d=26 is the critical spacetime dimension of the bosonic string. the velocity dependent corrections have an
analog in the type i superstring [13]. an analogous static term is present in the contribution from the neveu-schwarz
sector [13], prior to cancellation by other contributions to the vacuum amplitude [17]. it is evident from eq. (48)
that our result for the potential between slow moving sources holds for arbitrarily short distance scales lower than
min.2u, limited only by the domain of validity for the double expansion in small velocities and
the string scale: r2
short distances.
let us compare the short distance static potential with the known form of the heavy quark-antiquark potential in
qcd at long distances, a regime described by the eective dynamics of a thin ux tube linking the sources. the
usual route from the wilson loop expectation value to the static heavy quark-antiquark potential in gauge theory is as
follows. consider a rectangular wilson loop rt in the limit t
r with r held xed. the long legs of the rectangle
are interpreted as the proper time world-lines of a heavy quark and antiquark, and the loop expectation value takes
the form a(t )ev (r)t , with v (r) interpreted as the static quark-antiquark potential at xed spatial separation r.
a(t ) is some function with slower fall-o than an exponential. the reader may wonder why we considered a pair
correlation function rather than extract the potential from the expectation value of a single rectangular loop, as is
usual in gauge theory. the reason is weyl invariance: the world-sheet spanning a single rectangular boundary loop
has curvature singularities at the corners leading to weyl anomalies which would render a covariant path integral
quantization untenable. the large loop length limit hides this problem since the corners are pushed to . the
pair correlation function does not suer from this problem. in particular, for any pair of coplanar nested right-angled
loops we had a well-dened expression for the string path integral even prior to taking the large loop length limit.

the heavy quark-antiquark potential at long distances displays a conning linear plus attractive inverse power law

behavior:

v (r) = r +  +


r

+ o(1/r2)

.

(50)

 and  are known to be nonuniversal constants. of greater interest is the universal constant, , rst obtained by
luscher et al using heat kernel methods in [9]: =(d  2)/24 in the eective theory of the eguchi-schild string
[3]. recall the model independent argument for the coecient of the 1/r term [10] (see, also, the discussion in [28]).
consider the quantum dynamics of a thin ux tube linking quark and antiquark as described by an eective eld
theory. let d be the number of degrees of freedom. now the uctuations of a long thin ux tube in d1 spatial
dimensions are described by a two dimensional nonrenormalizable eective eld theory of d2 collective modes, with
universal behavior that of d2 free scalar elds, each with vacuum energy equal to /24. the o(1/r2) terms that are
quartic and higher order in the collective elds are irrelevant. the vacuum energy arises from the innite sum of free
eld harmonic oscillators in their ground state, with an independent sum for each of d2 degrees of freedom. irrelevant
couplings to higher dimensional operators can induce interactions; they determine the nonuniversal constants, , .
not surprisingly, this long distance result for the potential is in agreement with our expression for e0, the vacuum
energy from each of d2 free world-sheet scalars given in eq. (39).
our computation demonstrates that there is also a universal 1/r static potential at short distances: independent of
the dimensionality of the dbrane worldvolume, the geometrical parameters of the loops, and the string scale cuto.
as we can see from eq. (49), the numerical coecient at short distances predicted by string theory diers from
luschers long distance result. this may be interpreted in the eective eld theory as a wavefunction renormalization
for the wilson loop observable at short distances, an eect which cannot be determined in a eld theoretic analysis
insensitive to boundary eects. moreover, there is an innite number of velocity dependent corrections to the 1/r
term which are also universal. we obtained these corrections by a systematic double expansion in small velocities
and short distances, conveniently expressed as a convergent power series in dimensionless variables, z=r2
min./r2, uz/,
and u2.

our results can also be considered within the more traditional context of phenomenological models for short distance
nonperturbative dynamics in qcd (see, for example, [31] and citations thereof). the generic backgrounds for the
liouville eld with cm<d described in section iiic could be of interest in this context. we note that recent work2
on the short distance potential between heavy sources in qcd has examined modications of the potential at short
distances originating in nonperturbative instanton eects [32].

b. minimum distance and the short distance scattering of d0branes

d0branes are point-like topological defects in spacetime present in the generic background of the bosonic string
theory. consider the potential between two d0branes probed in their nonrelativistic scattering [19,29,20]. the
d0branes are assumed to have xed spatial separation b in the direction x d1, and are in relative slow motion in
an orthogonal direction x d with velocity v [19]. at long distances their static interaction potential will take the
newtonian form. the eective potential at long distances is dominated by the exchange of the lowest lying states in
the closed string spectrum. with no loss of generality, we can obtain the potential between two d0branes as a special
case of the general expression for the scattering of two dpbranes, p<d. we will show that the systematics of the small
velocity short distance double expansion and the value for the minimum distance probed in the scattering, rmin., is
identical to the result obtained above, in general agreement with previous analyses [19,20,17].

adapting the computation of the bosonic string annulus amplitude between static dpbranes [30,17] to the boundary

conditions pertinent to dpbrane scattering, and restricting to massless modes gives:

vdpbrane(r, u) = vp(82)

l21p/2(cid:20) tanh(u)
isin(iu)

(22 + 2cosh(2u))(cid:21)

.

(51)

notice that, unlike the expression for the short distance potential, a taylor expansion of the periodic functions in the
integrand for small velocities and long distances gives only o(u2) corrections to the static potential. the integration
domain is unrestricted for small velocities. performing the integration over l gives the simple result:

2 rp23(cid:2)24 + o(u2)(cid:3)

.

(52)

vdpbrane(r, u) = vp(82)

23p

setting p=0 gives the newtonian long distance interaction for d0branes in a d=26 dimensional spacetime.

at short distances, we will nd a crossover phenomenon analogous to what was found in the interaction potential of
a dpbrane with a dpbrane for dimensionalities, pp6=0 mod 4 [20]: the asymptotic long and short distance forms of
the pair potential between dpbranes in the bosonic string are not identical. consider the expression for the eective
potential due to the exchange of massless modes in the open string spectrum:

vdpbrane(r, u) = vp(82)

(53)

the small velocity short distance double expansion can be performed as explained in the previous section. the result
is the expression:

vdpbrane(r, u) = vp(82)

p+1

2 tanh(u)/u[24( p+1

(54)

where the velocity dependent corrections are obtained in a systematic expansion in the same dimensionless variables,
z2, uz/, and u2, dened above. for r2>>r2
min., z0, we recover the gamma functions, (). recall that gamma
functions with negative argument can be dened by iterating the well-known identity, ()=( + 1). we note
that the short distance static potential between d0branes is linear, and repulsive:

vd0brane(r) = (d  2)

r

2

+ o(z2, uz/, u2)

.

(55)

this result holds in a self-consistent small velocity short distance approximation with corrections of o(z2, uz/, u2).
it is valid for distances in the range, 2u<<r2<<2, and velocities in the range, u<<u+, where the upper bound
is estimated as described in section iva.

the static potential between d0branes corresponds to the vacuum energy in a background of open string theory
with constant electromagnetic potential, ad1, but with vanishing electric eld strength: ed1=0ad1=0 [5,19,17].
the potential is a measure of the shift in the vacuum energy relative to that in the background with no dbrane
sources.

v. conclusions

our computation in open and closed string theory is performed at weak coupling in at spacetime backgrounds
and in the critical spacetime dimension. there is a supersymmetric analog to this result which will be explored
in forthcoming work [13]. we have demonstrated the validity of the double expansion in small velocities and short
distances down to a minimum distance, r2
min.=2u, in general agreement with previous estimates [24,19,20,17]. thus,
string/m theory predicts an innite number of velocity dependent corrections to the potential between two heavy
sources in relative slow motion in a gauge theory, the numerical coecients of which are predicted by a systematic
expansion. we are not aware of a comparable theoretical analysis which reliably probes this regime of qcd. we note
that there is no evidence of non-analytic behavior in the potential between sources at short distances, suggesting that
the phase transition at short distances previously found in [22,27] is a large d artifact.

the numerical dierence between the coecient of the 1/r term we have found in the static potential at short
distance and that given by luschers eective eld theory analysis for the qcd ux tube valid at long distance
scales deserves explanation. we should note that the ux tube picture is inherently a long distance concept whose
predictions cannot be naively extrapolated to short distances. consider the d = 26 dimensional bosonic string. at
both long and short distances there is a proportionality factor in the 1/r potential which equals d  2, the number
of transverse massless gluon modes. the short distance static potential between heavy point sources in the gauge
theory is a measure of uctuations in the vacuum energy density. it would be gratifying if one could exploit the direct
calculation of the short distance potential from string theory given in this paper to explore nonperturbative physics
associated with the qcd vacuum at short distances, a subject rich in conjecture and in open questions [31]. this
deserves further study.

we conclude by noting that the characteristic d0brane velocity in the supersymmetric theory is of order ug2/3
[29], which implies a minimum distance r2
. it is interesting to note that, at large n , the shortest distances
that can be probed in the small velocity short distance approximation are pushed down to r2
e. /n [20], where
ge.=gsn . in the introduction, we emphasized the importance of taking a large n limit in order to keep gravitational
corrections to amplitudes in the open string sector suppressed at long distances; this was also an essential observation
underlying maldacenas conjecture [12]. we see now that taking the large n limit extends the regime of weakly
coupled open and closed string theory both in the directions of longer and of shorter distance scales. we believe it
would be of great interest to develop a systematic formulation of the large n limit of open and closed string theory.
