magnetic elds, branes and
noncommutative geometry

d. bigatti  and l. susskind

abstract

we construct a simple physical model of a particle moving on the innite noncommutative
2-plane. the model consists of a pair of opposite charges moving in a strong magnetic eld.
in addition, the charges are connected by a spring. in the limit of large magnetic eld, the
charges are frozen into the lowest landau levels. interactions of such particles include moyal-
bracket phases characteristic of eld theories on noncommutative space. the simple system
arises in the light cone quantization of open strings attached to d-branes in antisymmetric
tensor backgrounds. we use the model to work out the general form of light cone vertices
from string splitting. we then consider the form of feynman diagrams in (uncompactied)
noncommutative yang mills theories. we nd that for all planar diagrams the commutative
and noncommutative theories are exactly the same apart from trivial external line factors.
this means that the large n theories are equivalent in the t hooft limit. non-planar
diagrams are generally more convergent than their commutative counterparts.

1 the model

gauge theories on noncommutative spaces [1][2] are believed to be relevant to the quantiza-
tion of d-branes in background b elds [3] . the structure of such theories is similar to
that of ordinary gauge theory except that the usual product of elds is replaced by a star
product dened by

   = (x) exp{i 

x 


y  }(y )

(1)

where  is an antisymmetric constant tensor. the eect of such a modication is reected
in the momentum space vertices of the theory by factors of the form

exp[ipq]  eipq

(2)

the purpose of this paper is to show how these factors arise in an elementary way. we
will begin by describing a simple quantum mechanical system which is fundamental to our
construction. we then consider string theory in the presence of a d3-brane and a constant
large b eld. in the light cone frame the rst quantized string is described by our ele-
mentary model. we use the model to compute the string splitting vertex and show how
the factors in eq.(2) emerge. we then turn to the structure of the perturbation series for
the non-commutative theory in innite at space. we nd that planar diagrams with any
number of loops are identical to their commutative counterparts apart from trivial external
line phase factors.

compactication, which can lead to entirely new features, is not studied in this paper.

1.1 the model at classical level

consider a pair of unit charges of opposite sign in a magnetic eld b in the regime where
the coulomb and the radiation terms are negligible. the coordinates of the charges are ~x1
and ~x2 or in component form xi

1 and xi

l =

(3)

where the rst term is the kinetic energy of the charges, the second term is their interaction
with the magnetic eld and the last term is an harmonic potential between the charges.

in what follows we will be interested in the limit in which the rst term can be ignored.
this is typically the case if b is so large that the available energy is insucient to excite
higher landau levels. thus we will focus on the simplied lagrangian

l =

b

ij(cid:16) xi

let us rst discuss the classical system. the canonical momenta are given by

let us dene center of mass and relative coordinates x, :

~x = ( ~x1 + ~x2)/2
~ = ( ~x1  ~x2)/2

the lagrangian is

l = m(( x)2 + ( )2) + 2bij

x ij  2k()2

dropping the kinetic terms gives

the momentum conjugate to x is

l = 2bij x ij  2k()2

l
 x i

= 2bijj = pi

this is the center of mass momentum.

finally, the hamiltonian is

k
2b2 p 2
this is the hamiltonian of a nonrelativistic particle with mass

(11)

evidently the composite system of opposite charges moves like a galileian particle of
mass m. what is unusual is that the spatial extension  of the system is related to its
momentum so that the size grows linearly with p according to eq. (9). how does this
growth with momentum eect the interactions of the composite? lets suppose charge 1
interacts locally with an impurity centered at the origin. the interaction has the form

in terms of x and  this becomes

v (~x1) =  (~x1)

v =  (x + ) =  (x i 

1
2b

ijpj)

(12)

(13)

note that the interaction in terms of the center of mass coordinate is nonlocal in a particular
way. the interaction point is shifted by a momentum dependent amount. this is the origin
of the peculiar momentum dependent phases that appear in interaction vertices on the
noncommutative plane. more generally, if particle 1 sees a potential v (x1) the interaction
becomes

v (cid:18)x 

p

2b(cid:19)

(14)

1.2 quantum level

the main problem in quantizing the system is to correctly dene expressions like (14) which
in general have factor ordering and other quantum ambiguities. in order to dene them, let
us assume that v can be expressed as a fourier transform

v (x) = z dq v (q)eiqx

we can then formally write

v (x 

p
2b

) = z dq v (q)eiq(x p

2b )

the factor ordering is not ambiguous because

[qix i, qlljpj] = qiqllj[x ipj] = 0

consider the matrix element

hk| exp[iq(x 

p
2b

)]|li

where hk| and |li are momentum eigenvectors. using eq.(17) we can write this as

hk| exp[iqx] exp[i

qp
2b

]|li

since |li is an eigenvector of p this becomes

hk| exp[iqx]|li exp[i

ql
2b

] = (k  q  l) exp[iql/2b]

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(20)

the phase factor is the usual moyal bracket phase that is ubiquitous in noncommutative
geometry.

2 string theory in magnetic elds

let us consider bosonic string theory in the presence of a d3-brane. the coordinates of the
brane are x0, x1, x2, x3. the remaining coordinates will play no role. we will also assume
a background antisymmetric tensor eld b in the 1,2 direction. we will study the open
string sector with string ends attached to the d3-brane in the light cone frame.

we have numerically xed  and the parameter l can be identied with p, the momentum

in what follows we will be interested in the limit b  . let us make the following

then

now for b   we can drop the rst term. furthermore by an integration by parts

and up to a total time derivative the last term can be written

thus

l =

them out. the solution of the classical equation of motion is

evidently, the action is of the same form as the model in section 1 with b and k rescaled.

3 the interaction vertex

interactions in light cone string theory are represented by string splitting and joining. con-
sider two incoming strings with momenta p1, p2 and center of mass positions y1, y2. if their
endpoints coincide they can join to form a third string with momentum p3. the constraints
on the endpoints are summarized by the overlap  function

 = ((y1  1)  (y2 + 2)) ((y2  2)  (y3 + 3)) ((y3  3)  (y1 + 1))
from eq.(29) we see that the center of mass momentum is related to  by

inserting this in eq.(30) gives the vertex

p = 

 = (y1  y2 + (p1 + p2)) (y2  y3 + (p2 + p3)) (y3  y1 + (p3 + p1))

(30)

(31)

(32)

to get the vertex in momentum space multiply by ei(p1y1+p2y2+p3y3) and integrate over y.

this yields

 = ei(p1p2)(p1 + p2 + p3)

(33)

this is the usual form of the vertex in noncommutative eld theory. we have scaled the
transverse coordinates x1, x2 (but not x0, x3) and momenta so that the b eld does
not appear in the vertex.
if we go back to the original units the phases in (33) will be
proportional to 1/b.

evidently a quantum of noncommutative yang mills theory may be thought of as a
straight string connecting two opposite charges. the separation vector  is perpendicular
to the direction of motion p .

now consider the geometry of the 3-body vertex. the string endpoints u, v, w dene a

triangle with sides

1 = (u  v)
2 = (v  w)
3 = (w  u)

(34)

and the three momenta are perpendicular to the corresponding . it is straightforward to
see that the phase

ijpiqj/b  p  q

(35)

is just the area of the triangle times b. in other words, it is the magnetic ux through the
triangle. note that it can be of either sign.

more generally, we may consider a feynman tree diagram constructed from such vertices.
for example consider gure (1a). the overall phase is the total ux through the triangles
a, b and c. in fact we can simplify this by shrinking the internal propagators to get gure
(1b). thus the phase is the ux through a polygon formed from the s of the external lines.
the phase depends only on the momenta of the external lines and their cyclic order.

4 structure of perturbation theory

in this section we will consider the eects of the moyal phases on the structure of feynman
amplitudes in noncommutative yang mills theory. let us rst review the diagram rules for
ordinary yang mills theory in t hooft double-line representation.

the gauge propagator can be represented as a double line as if the gauge boson were a
quark-antiquark pair as in gure(2). each gluon is equipped with a pair of gauge indices
i, j, a momentum p and a polarization  satisfying   p = p = 0.

the vertex describing 3-gauge boson interaction is shown in gure(3).

in addition to
kronecker  for the gauge indices and momentum  functions the vertex contains the factor

(1  p3 + 3  p2 + 2  p1)

(36)

the factor is antisymmetric under interchange of any pair and so it must be accompanied
by an antisymmetric function of the gauge indices. for a purely abelian theory the vertex
vanishes when symmetrized.

now we add the new factor coming from the moyal bracket. this factor is

eip1p2 = eip2p3 = eip3p1

where pa  pb indicates an antisymmetric product
p  q = pq
 = 

(37)

(38)

because these factors are not symmetric under interchange of particles, the vertex no longer
vanishes when bose symmetrized even for the abelian theory.

the phase factors satisfy an important identity. let us consider the phase factors that
accompany a given diagram. in fact from now on a diagram will indicate only the phase
factor from the product of vertices. now consider the diagram in gure(4a). it is given by

ei(p1p2)ei(p1+p2)p3 = ei(p1p2+p2p3+p1p3)

(39)

on the other hand the dual diagram gure(4b) is given by ei(p1(p2+p3)+p2p3). it is identical
to the previous diagram. thus the moyal phases satisfy old fashioned channel duality.
this conclusion is also obvious from the ux through polygon construction of the previous
section.

in what follows, a duality move will refer to a replacement of a diagram such as in

gure(4a) by the dual diagram in gure(4b).

now consider any planar diagram with l loops. by a series of duality moves it can
be brought to the form indicated in gure(5) consisting of a tree with l simple one-loop
tadpoles.

let us consider the tadpole gure(6). the phase factor is just eiqq = 1. thus the loop
contributes nothing to the phase and the net eect of the moyal factors is exactly that of

6

the tree diagram. in fact all trees contributing to a given topology have the same phase,
which is a function only of the external momentum. the result is that for planar diagrams
the moyal phases do not aect the feynman integrations at all. in particular the planar
diagrams have exactly the same divergences as in the commutative theory. evidently in the
large n limit noncommutative yang mills = ordinary yang mills.

on the other hand, divergences that occur in nonplanar diagrams can be regulated by
the phase factors. for example consider the nonplanar diagram in gure(7). the moyal
phase for the diagram is

eipqeipq = e2ipq

(40)

and does not cancel.
it is not dicult to see that such oscillating phases will regulate
divergent diagrams and make them nite, unless the diagram contains divergent planar
subdiagrams. thus it seems that the leading high momentum behavior of the theory is
controlled by the planar diagrams. among other things it means that in this region the 1/n
corrections to the t hooft limit must vanish.

an interesting question arises if we study the theory on a torus of nite size [4] . for an
ordinary local eld theory high momentum behavior means small distance behavior. for this
reason we expect the high momentum behavior on a torus to be identical to that in innite
space once the momentum becomes much larger than the inverse size of the torus. however
in the noncommutative case the story is more interesting. we have seen that high momentum
in the 1,2 plane is associated with large distances in the perpendicular direction. most likely
this means that the nite torus generically behaves very dierently at high momentum than
the innite plane.

indeed there is an exception to the rule that nonplanar diagrams are nite. if a line with
a nonplanar self energy insertion such as in gure(7) happens to have vanishing momentum
in the 1,2 plane then according to eq(40) its phase will vanish. thus for a set of measure zero,
the nonplanar self energy diagram can diverge. this presumably leads to no divergences in
innite space when the line in question is integrated over. the situation could be dierent
for compact noncommutative geometries since integrals over momenta are replaced by sums
[5].

the fact that the large n limit is essentially the same for noncommutative and ordinary
yang mills theories implies that in the ads/cft correspondence the introduction of non-
commutative geometry does not change the thermodynamics of the theory [6]. it may also
be connected to the fact that in the matrix theory construction of connes-douglas-schwartz
and douglas-hull, the large n limit eectively decompacties x 11 and should therefore elim-
inate dependence on the 3-form potential. however the argument is not straightforward since
in matrix theory we are not usually in the t hooft limit.
