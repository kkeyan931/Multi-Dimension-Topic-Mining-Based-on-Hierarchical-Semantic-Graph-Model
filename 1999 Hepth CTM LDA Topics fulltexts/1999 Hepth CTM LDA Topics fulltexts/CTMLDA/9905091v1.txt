abstract

we study the scattering of three gravitons in m-atrix theory at nite n. with
a specic choice of the background we obtain the complete result up to two
loops. the contributions from three-body forces agree with the ones presented
in recent papers. we extend the calculation and evaluate the recoil eects
as well. such terms, somewhat dicult to isolate and compute, had been
neglected so far in the existing literature. we show that the result we have
obtained from m-atrix theory precisely matches the result from one-particle
reducible tree diagrams in eleven-dimensional supergravity .

1 introduction

since the introduction of the matrix model of m-theory [1] much work and much progress
have been made on the subject. according to the original conjecture, the degrees of
freedom of m-theory in the innite momentum frame are contained in the dynamics of
n d0-branes in the n   limit. subsequently it was argued that m-theory with one
of the lightlike coordinate compactied, the so called discrete light cone sector, is in fact
equivalent to the super yang-mills matrix model for nite n [2], [3]. compelling tests
of this proposal have been the comparison of two-body [4, 5] and three-body [6, 7, 8, 9]
scattering.

we focus on the m-atrix theory at nite n and explore further its correspondence with
eleven dimensional supergravity. in particular we consider n = 3 and compute graphs
up to two-loops in (0 + 1)-dimensional yang-mills. we nd that they perfectly reproduce
the three graviton scattering in supergravity, both in the direct three-body channel and
in the two-body recoil exchange. while the former, which corresponds to one-particle
irreducible diagrams, has been computed in ref.
[6] and we conrm that result, recoil
eects have been omitted previous to our calculation. we have found a systematic way
to separate the light and heavy matrix model degrees of freedom which allows to obtain
the complete answer. we show that the recoil contributions exactly match what expected
from the two-loop scattering of two d0-branes in m-atrix theory [5].

in the next section we derive the explicit form of the gauged xed action. the various
elds are decomposed in terms of components on a u(3) basis of hermitean matrices. the
classical background is xed with the three d-particles having relative velocities parallel
to each others, orthogonal to the corresponding relative displacements. the feynman
rules are easily derived. in section 3 we give the two-loop eective action, leaving most of
the technical details in the appendices. the result is analyzed keeping separate the two
types of contributions mentioned above, i.e. terms which depend on two distinct relative
velocities (three-body interaction) and terms in which only one relative velocity appears
(recoil). the last section contains a summary of our results. we have performed part of
the calculations with the help of mathematica.

2 the action

as anticipated in the introduction, the matrix model is simply obtained by reducing (9+1)-
dimensional u(n) super yang-mills [10] to (0 + 1) dimensions. this theory describes a
system of n d0-branes [11] in terms of nine bosonic elds xi and of sixteen fermionic

1

superpartners , which are spinors under so(9). the euclidean action is given by

s = trz d (cid:26)(d xi)2 

g

[xk, xj][xk, xj]

+t d   gt k[xk, ]o

(2.1)

d =   ig[a,

where we have denoted by g the yang-mills coupling constant and by i nine real, sym-
metric gamma matrices satisfying {i, j} = 2ij. the covariant derivative is dened
by
(2.2)
the elds xi,  and a are n  n hermitean matrices of u(n), with i, j, k = 1, 2, . . . , 9.
being interested in quantum, perturbative calculations it is convenient to use the
background eld method, which allows to maintain explicit the gauge invariance of the
result. to this end one expands the action (2.1) around a classical background eld
conguration bi, setting xi  xi + bi. after gauge-xing and trivial rescaling of the
elds, the complete action is
s = trz d (cid:26)( xi)2  [bk, xj]2  2g[bk, xj][xk, xj]

(2.3)

here xi, a and  are the quantum uctuations, g and g are the ghosts, while bk is the
external background.

since we want to extract results to be compared to the scattering of three gravitons in
supergravity, the minimal choice for the yang-mills gauge group that allows to describe
the interaction of three d0-branes, is u(3). in appendix a we explicitly give the cartan
basis h 1, h 2, e (where  = 1,2,3 are the roots), and the commutator algebra.

using such a basis every matrix eld is decomposed into components as

k ha + x 

k e + x 

xk  x a
k e
a  aaha + ae + ae
  aha + e + e
g  gaha + ge + ge
g  gaha + ge + ge

(2.4)

in order to keep the notation simple we use a greek index  = 1, 2, 3 as a sux to
enumerate some of the component elds and the same index to indicate the corresponding
root on the matrices, i.e. e1  e1, e2  e2, e3  e3. similarly, in the following of
the paper the roots will be denoted with the same understanding: to be more explicit, if
we write x x    we mean for example when  = 1 and  = 2  x 1x 21  2. notice
in addition that the hermiticity condition gives e.g. x 
straight line

from the quadratic part of the action one can easily read the mass matrix ( diagonalizing

 8 complex bosons with mass (r)2 where  = 1, 2, 3;
 1 complex boson with mass (r)2  2v where  = 1, 2, 3;
 20 real, massless bosons;

in the next section we present the two-loop calculation.

(2.23)

3 the two-loop eective action

the two-loop contributions are evaluated considering two types of diagrams involving
one four-point vertex, the gure-eight graphs, and two three-point vertices, the sunset-
type graphs, respectively. given our setup, we can distinguish between the ones that
lead to genuine three-body exchanges (oneparticle irreducible diagrams for the three
graviton scattering in supergravity) and two-body recoil eects (one-particle reducible
graphs in supergravity) in a very simple manner. we need collect terms that depend
on two independent relative velocities on one side, and terms that depend only on one
relative velocity on the other side.

thus from the gure-eight diagrams we have a three-body exchange whenever the
two propagators come in with dierent masses, while a recoil term is produced when the
two masses are equal. the presence of a massless propagator would lead to a vanishing
contribution for this tadpole kind of diagrams.

from the sunset-type graphs we have direct three-body contributions when the three
propagators have three distinct masses (three dierent relative velocities out of which two
are independent). two-body forces are present when two masses are equal, being the
third one equal to zero as required by momentum conservation. having decomposed the
elds as in (2.4) makes it easy to identify the massless particles which are given simply
by the diagonal degrees of freedom.

7

now we present our results. first we collect all the contributions to the three-body
forces: we follow as much as possible the approach in ref. [6] so that a direct comparison
can be made in a straightforward manner. complete agreement with their ndings is
shown in the next subsection. then we concentrate on the two-loop contributions that
depend only on one relative velocity v. their complete evaluation is conceptually simple
and algebraically manageable within our approach. we isolate the leading order term and
prove its consistency with the result from two-graviton scattering obtained in [5]. this
shows without any further ambiguity that we are dealing with recoil eects.

3.1 three-body contributions

as emphasized above we need compute all the two-loop terms which depend on two dis-
tinct relative velocities, and this implies that only propagators associated to o-diagonal
degrees of freedom (see (2.4)) will enter this part of the calculation. we have to focus
on four-point vertices for the gure-eight diagrams and three point interactions for the
sunset diagrams: they are explicitly given in (2.14), (2.15), (2.16) and (2.17). the corre-
sponding propagators can be read from (2.18), (2.19) and (2.20), (2.21). in order to keep
the notation compact we write (s)  (,  , s). the full result is given by

 =  x6=6=(cid:20)z dt ds2ds3 p0 (cid:16)(s2)(s3)(cid:17)|t=0

+ z dt dtds1ds2ds3 p6 bb (s1)(s2)(s3)(cid:21)

(3.1)

where the complete expressions of the various p s are given in appendix b.

at this point we perform manipulations similar to the ones introduced in ref. [6]: this

will lead to an easy comparison of our results and theirs. since

b + b + b = 0

v + v + v = 0

 6=  6=

(3.3)

the identity in (3.3) allows to combine p6 and p5: we rename the resulting expression
p new
. in the same way, using again (3.3) we combine p4 and p3 and rename their sum
p new
. moreover as in [6] we can write

5

z dt ds2ds3p (cid:16)(s2)(s3)(cid:17)|t=0

= z dt dtds2ds3p (t)(s2)(s3)

= z dt dtds1ds2ds3p (s1(s1)) (s2)(s3)

(3.4)

it is rather straightforward to show that, with the help of (3.3), (3.4) and (3.5), the answer
in (3.1) can be rearranged as a sum of two contributions

indeed, recalling the expression of  in (2.21), the above identity allows to perform the
following substitutions in the integrals in t and t:

t 2(s1)(s2)(s3) 

t2(s1)(s2)(s3) 

(s1)(s2)(s3)

2 (vtanh(vs1) + vtanh(vs2) + vtanh(vs3))

(s1)(s2)(s3)

2 (vcoth(vs1) + vcoth(vs2) + vcoth(vs3))

(3.10)

10

finally in (3.8) we can expand the various coecients in front of the common factor
(s1)(s2)(s3) in powers of v and nd the rst non vanishing contribution at order
v8

(s1v  s2v)2(s1v  s3v)2(s2v  s3v)2
)(s1)(s2)(s3)

(3.11)

we note that in ref. [6] the corresponding leading contribution is at order v6. with our
choice of the background it is easy to check that the order v6 term vanishes identically since
all the relative velocities are parallel to each other. the order v8 contribution is contained
in the complete answer given in [6], but algebraically too dicult to be reconstructed. in
our case it can be evaluated rather easily since it is the rst non vanishing contribution.

now we turn to the calculation of the recoil eects.

3.2 two-body recoil contributions

we consider here all the diagrams not computed in the previous section, i.e. gure-eight
graphs with the two propagators carrying the same mass, and sunset-type graphs with
two propagators of equal masses and the third one massless. looking at the spectrum
of the various particles it is clear that these contributions depend on a single relative
velocity v and are thus candidates to represent supegravity two-body recoil eects. in
this section we determine them exactly and show that the above interpretation is indeed
conrmed.

the complete amplitude can be written (cfr. (3.1)):

recoil = x (cid:20)z dt ds1ds2 q0 ((s2)(s3))|t=0

+z dt dtds1ds2 q1 0(  (s2))(s1)
+z dt dtds1ds2 q2 0( (s1)) ( (s2))
+z dt dtds1ds2 q3 0(v  (s2))(s2)
+z dt dtds1ds2 q4 v2
   0(s1)(s2)
+z dt dtds1ds2 q5 (b)2 0(s1)(s2)

11

t 2 0(s1)(s2)

+z dt dtds1ds2 q6 v2
+z dt dtds1ds2 q7 v2
+ z dt dtds1ds2 q8 0(s1)(s2)(cid:21)

t2 0(s1)(s2)

(3.12)

where the expressions of the q coecients are given in appendix c. if we compare (3.12)
with the corresponding three-body exchange contributions in (3.1) we notice that in the
present case each term contains only one v. as before the gure-eight terms are the ones
in which q0 appears; all the rest comes from sunset graphs with one massless propagator,
0.

as we have done for the three-body calculation we can simplify the form of the result.

we use the following relation

z dt ds1ds2 q0 ((s1)(s2))|t=0 = z dt dtds1ds2 q0 (t)(s1)(s2)
= z dt dtds1ds1 q0 (  0) (s1)(s2)
= z dt dtds1ds1 q0 0(cid:16)  (s1)(s2) + 2 (s1) (s2)

+ (s1)  (s2)(cid:17)

(3.13)

given the expressions of the propagators in (2.21), we are able to perform the derivatives
in (3.12) explicitly. in addition, in complete analogy with what we have done in (3.9)
and in (3.10), we can show that, since we are integrating over t and t the following
substitutions are allowed

t 20(s1)(s2) 
t20(s1)(s2) 

1

2v (tanh(vs1) + tanh(vs2))

0(s1)(s2)

1

v (coth(vs1) + coth(vs2))

0(s1)(s2)

the above substitutions lead to

recoil = x (cid:20)z dt dtds1ds2(cid:16)(b)2s1 + s2(cid:17)0(s1)(s2)(cid:21)

where s1 and s2 are given by

s1 = 40 + 2 cosh(2s1v) + 32 cosh((s1  s2)v) + 2 cosh(2s2v)

the expression in (3.23) can be directly compared with the result in ref. [5] where the two
graviton scattering was analyzed: we nd that numbers perfectly match. the expression
in (3.15) with v in (3.7) and y in (3.8) determines the full twoloop contribution to
the three dparticle eective action.

4 conclusions

in this paper we have presented a complete two-loop calculation in m-atrix theory. we
have considered the gauge group u(3), thus focusing on the description of three d 0-
branes. in order to maintain the algebraic complexity of the computation under control,
we have made a specic choice of the classical background, i.e. we have restricted our

14

attention to the case of three d-particles whose relative velocities are parallel and or-
thogonal to the corresponding relative displacements. first we have conrmed the results
obtained in [6], showing that the predictions from one-particle irreducible tree diagrams
in supergravity are in agreement with two-loop contributions from m-atrix theory. then
we have considered those two-loop contributions which depend only on one relative ve-
locity. the novelty of our result resides primarily in this part of our work. we have
shown that this new type of terms gives a total sum which is exactly consistent with what
is obtained from a two-loop calculation of two d-particle scattering [5]. therefore we
can safely conclude that we have determined the recoil eects which simply ammount to
one-particle reducible tree level diagrams in supergravity. once more one nds impressive
evidence that eleven-dimensional supergravity compactied in a null direction is in direct
correspondence with m-atrix theory results for nite n.
