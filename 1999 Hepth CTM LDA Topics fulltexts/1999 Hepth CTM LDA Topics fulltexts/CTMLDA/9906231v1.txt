1 abstract

the article gives the explicit interpretation of the nonlinear locally anisotropic
model of boze string1. the equations of motions and tensor of energy-
momentum, the background eld method applied to get order extensions
of the eective action consequently accommodated to the geometry of lo-
cally anisotropic spaces, additional contributions-corrections resulted from
the richer geometric character of the model are calculated and interpreted
from the possible physical point of view. it is shown that the strings the-
ory considered on spaces with local anisotropy and nonlinear connections are
renormalizable taken the similar nature of the explicitly calculated anisotropic
corrections with the riemannian one.

author explains shortly necessary geometrical background and conven-
tions of locally anisotropic geometry as well as the eects of this geometry
on strings. mention is given particularly to the interpretation of the results
and new aspects that features the locally anisotropic strings form their
riemannian counterparts.

1the author is indebted to dr. sergiu vacaru for some conceptual discussions.

2 introduction

the concept of locally anisotropic strings and of the nonlinear model had
already been advanced in some works [32, 33, 27]. there has been given
the substantial body of conceptual motivation and necessary geometrical
language adopted to develop the locally anisotropic (super)strings [15, 7, 6],
and their extensions to superstrings [10, 14, 30].

the diversity of results formulated and obtained in locally anisotropic
physics [31, 37, 35, 36, 34] provoked and justied a special interest for mod-
elling of nonlinear model on spaces with local anisotropy.
as the nonlinear geometry considered sometimes inadequate or rather
inappropriate for the easily accepted standard mathematical tools to explain
physical phenomena, physicists always remain unhappy that the diverse
nature of the phenomenon considered is somewhat straiten out by isotropic
and/or linear approximations. a physicist always wants that linear isotropic
mathematical tool applied to describe a phenomena keep the model exible
enough to consider possible intrusions deviations, interferences, interactions
and corrections. it has been a predominant practice that intrinsically desired
exibility is introduced or accounted for with the help of some external to
the initial mathematical tool of model assumptions or approximations.
it
does though make happy the physicist, however demonstrating after all, how
innovative the human intelligence is, yet leaves one with the sense of self-
inconsistency of the theory itself.

the proposed example demonstrates how the nonlinear geometry-spaces
with nonlinear connection or spaces with local anisotropy, spaces that evi-
dently will make happy any physicist to modulate a phenomena, once he/she
has an appropriate mathematical tool to work with, allows the generaliza-
tion of the non-linear model. the explicitly constructed model on locally
anisotropic spaces gives not just necessarily locally anisotropic corrections,
but is manifestly renormalizable and consistent with the standard previously
obtained results of nonlinear model and what is important essentially
widens the horizon of modelling string theories.
the rich nature of the ber-base structures allows, apart from construc-
tion of strict physically friendly results, hypothetical interpretation of the
ber-base objects, as for instance the interaction gauge like elds. this ob-
jects serve also simultaneously as some additional terms-calculated explicitly
in this work-for the standard nonlinear model. the ber-base objects,

2

reasonably judged, may lead to some further developments of string theory
as for, instance the consistent explication of the string interactions. the
above suggested ideas may justiably present certain interest for physicists.
the article is structured sa follows: rst goes a brief introduction into
locally anisotropic geometry and objects; than the equations of motion and
tensor of energy-momentum of locally anisotropic strings is considered; fol-
lows the accommodation of the standard background eld method;
later
the eective action order extension and locally anisotropic counterterms dis-
cussed widely; the article nalizes conclusions and discussions of the obtained
results.

try.

we consider  = (e, , f, g, m) to be a locally trivial vector bundle, v-
bundle, where f is a vector space with dimf =m, g is a group of automor-
phism of f ,  = e  m is a surjective map and a dierentiable manifold
f, dim e=m + n is called as the total space of v-bundle . we can locally
parameterize  by coordinates u = (xi, ya), where i, j, k, l, m, n, u, ... take
value 0, 1, ...n  1 and greek indices a, b, c, d, e, f, ... take value 0, 1, ...m  1.

4 equation of motion and energy-momentum

tensor of locally anisotropic strings.

we are intending to get strings equation of motion considering the move-
ment of the two-dimensional surface imbed in (n + m) dimensional locally
anisotropic space-time geometry and expansion of the tensor energy-momentum
to locally anisotropic geometry (lag). we discuss some particular conse-
quences of the locally anisotropic strings (las).

the - model which corresponds to the bose string action with witten-

zumino term in locally anisotropic case is

i0 =

1

4 z dz(cid:16)auaug(u) + iabaubuh(u)(cid:17)

(18)


varying with respect to
u in order to get strings equation of motion we
note that due to the locally antisymmetric nature of the second term in (18)
it does not contribute to strings equation of motion and taking into account
the compatibility condition

dg(u) =

g = 0

.

one can split 
 parts on the dierent bases.
let us consider one of them minding one more that will be taken as

(u) into symmetric part s

(u) and nonsymmetric

essential in next section.

symmetric part of 

(u) can be obtained by simple substraction of

nonsymmetric part n

jk(x, y)axibxj = 0

bc(x, y)ayabyb = 0 )

(23)

the equation (23) gives rise to the idea that in locally anisotropic case we have
two way directions to move each being in corresponding subspaces (ber and
base). however, they are not independent due to independence of li
jk(x, y)
and c a
bc(x, y) on u(x, y) so that motion in ber bears an impact from the

8

point of view of physical applications consequences. we intend to discuss it
in the next paper.

our next step is to have energy-momentum tensor extended to the case
of the locally anisotropic geometry. we proceed by varying with respect to
g(u) :

g(u)

2z d2zgt(u) = 0

where

t = auau

ggauau = 0.

the later result pefectly ts with the standard one in riemannian case[28],
as is to expect.

5 locally anisotropic geometry background

field method.

this section deals with formulating of the riemannian coordinates to the
case of the locally anisotropic geometry. we consider also the possibility to
obtain symmetric part of 
(u) on the basis of having certain restrictions
xed on linear connection in the adapted basis.

one embraces here a dierent approach adapted in [33, 32] rather devel-
oping the standard normal (riemannian) coordinates [29], generalizing them
to the case of locally anisotropic geometry [27]. author follows the general
logic of the order extension contained in [8, 25]. as far as u = (xi, ya),  =
(i, a) and making shift u  u +  and expanding it as a power series in
 we get

u = u

the general form is the same as in riemannian space-time but the essence
consists in the fact that  splits in ber a and i components and as we see

later contractions are possible only for d(ab)or d(ij) as far as dimm 6=dimf
case. yet, d() contractions present special interest in vector bundle space).

 can be also achieved by reducing local anisotropic
space-time i.e. restricting the mixed components of the d- connection. pro-
ceeding this way we get that torsion vanishes and we can dene locally and
 and summing up over the ber-ber and base-base
along with a curve

in what follows one explicitly calculates exclusively the contributions
given by the richer aspects of the locally anisotropic apace time only. also,
we omit the contributions of the contributions of wzw term solely given the

13

intention to avoid overwhelming of the calculations. the obtained results
will be added to the standard one cited here from [24].

so, the additional action ila[u] to be added to the standard action i[u]
comes explicitly from the properties of the locally anisotropic strings. the
general structure of the locally anisotropic eective action of non-linear model
is:

la[u] = ila[u] + i g
i g

la(x) + i h

la(y) + i gh

la

(x, y);

(39)

la

where i g
la(x) string eective action on base coinciding to standard rieman-
nian one. the term i gh
(x, y) has inuence of both ber and base. the
contributions of i gh
(x, y) projected on base, so that to the standard model,
add nonlinear anisotropic corrections we pursue to calculate. the contri-
bution of i gh
(x, y) can be virtually interpreted2 as the eective action of
interaction between eective action of, say base residing string i g
la(x) and
similarly ber string i h

interfere with those of base component as well as, it has been intended to see
the eects upon the base evolvements.

here one can envisage at least two possible ways to count the eects of

(x, y). first is to project the additional terms on base, so that they lost
la
vehemently the ber aspect whatsoever. second, is to interpret the ber-base
nature of the corrections as they have signicance from the point of view of
ber-base interactions. there are both conveniently approached, whereas the
rst one is of primarily interest in the framework of exclusive calculation of
locally anisotropic corrections, while the second one appealed to justifying
the physically charged nature of the additional terms.

j = abvjbaxj, w ab

where elds v ab
i = wiabxi are transformed as gauge
like elds, so that the only possible invariant of which has four dimension and
cannot contribute to uv divergencies of two dimensional space. therefore,
the only additional uv divergent contribution remains

pi (gh)

count,1 = (4)1z daz(kijaxibxj)

(48)

the last produces a set of new diagrams, presented below. the structure of
pi (gh)
count,1 has not been essentially dierent from the rest of the standard coun-
terterms that thus allows to presuppose, within the rst mentioned above

18

approach, simple locally anisotropic correction.3.

if not projected on base the diagrams resulted from (48), will bear tensor
sings of ber. also the one loop base-ber diagrams will not be transformed
in two loop diagrams, one of which will be base and another one ber loop.

linear connections in higher order anisotropic superspaces, e-print: hep-th/9607194

this is explicable by the fact that the ber tensor order is low enough to
prevent order expansion in those one loop counterterms that contribute to
base standard counterterms. the ber terms allowing ber order expansion
and forming up ber one loop do not result in base loops.

at the same time the tensor structure of the terms vjbaxj, wiabxi
suggests their gauge like character. their role is not interpreted and clear
yet.

adding up easily the contributions of one and two loop locally anisotropic

where (gh)
(2)ij accounts for the contributions of the diagrams (49) si (55) and
other possible diagrams to be resulted from locally anisotropic dependence

already well known, see for instance [24], (g)

7 conclusions and interpretation of results

it is clear that the locally anisotropic spaces, spaces provided with the struc-
ture of nonlinear connection allows conceptual and consistent generalization
of the (super)strings models, as they are modelled on a explicitly anisotropic
geometric background.

the above presented results show that the basic techniques developed in
(super)strings theory after some accommodations to the features of locally
anisotropic spaces are successfully applicable. the locally anisotropic nonlin-
ear model is apparently renormalizable, the locally anisotropic corrections
having manifestly similar structure to those of standard nonlinear model.
the extension of the explicit locally anisotropic strings to locally anisotropic
superstrings is far only a matter of technical aspects.

an interesting feature of the locally anisotropic strings comes from the
role of the vjbaxj, wiabxi gauge like elds and their ber symmetric coun-
terparts. the explicit form of these elds are given by (46). these terms on
one hand can contribute to two loop base diagrams and are gauge like elds
in base one loop approximation. at the same time they are manifestly gauge
like elds in ber space. this twofold nature of the terms: a contributing
term on base and simultaneously gauge like eld in ber may virtually in-
spire to physically interesting interpretations, as for instance can be string
interaction 4.

in the number of above cited works the geometry of locally anisotropic
spaces had been groundly considered physically natural and quite appropriate
bases to modeling and investigating fundamental interactions. the explic-
itly presented example is considered by author to be one of the convincing
argument for raising the validity and trustworthy of the locally anisotropic
spaces in physicists perception.
