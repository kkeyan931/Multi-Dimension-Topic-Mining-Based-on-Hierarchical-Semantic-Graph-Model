the one-loop renormalization of a general chiral gauge theory without scalar and
majorana elds is fully worked out within breitenlohner and maison dimensional
renormalization scheme. the coecients of the anomalous terms introduced in the
slavnov-taylor equations by the minimal subtraction algorithm are calculated and
the asymmetric counterterms needed to restore the brs symmetry, if the anomaly
cancellation conditions are met, are computed. the renormalization group equation
and its coecients are worked out in the anomaly free case. the computations draw
heavily from the existence of action principles and brs cohomology theory.

1. introduction

dimensional regularization [1,2] is the standard regularization method in four dimen-
sional perturbative quantum eld theory as applied to particle physics. both its axiomatics
and properties were rigorously established long ago [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] and quite a number of
computational techniques based on the method have been developed over the years [11,12].
involved multiloop computations of the parameters of the standard model, a must due
to the availability of high precision tests of the model in particle accelerators, have been
carried out in the simplest possible setting thanks to dimensional regularization [13]. the
success of dimensional regularization as a practical regularization method stems from the
fact that it preserves the brs symmetry of vector-like non-supersymmetric gauge theories
without distorting neither the shape of the integrand of a regularized feynman diagram
nor the properties of the algebraic objects involved (no chiral objects being present). the
minimal subtraction scheme, the famous ms scheme [11], then leads [2] to a renormalized
brs-invariant theory [3,6]. counterterms are generated by multiplicative renormaliza-
tion of the tree-level lagrangian, so that  functions and anomalous dimensions can be
computed easily [10].

it is an empirical fact that electroweak interactions are chiral and hence vector-like
gauge theories does fail to account for them. it turn thus out that chiral gauge theories
are of key importance to understanding nature. unfortunately, dimensional regulariza-
tion loses its smartness when applied to chiral gauge theories. the algebraic properties

that the matrix 5 has in four dimensions cannot be maintained without introducing al-
gebraic inconsistencies as we move away from four dimensions [14]. hence, within the
framework of dimensional regularization, the denition of the object 5 in d complex
dimensions demands a new set of algebraic identities. there exists such a set of identi-
ties, they were introduced in ref. [3], following refs. [2,15], and they entail that the object
5 anticommutes no longer with the object . the axiomatics of dimensional regular-
ization so established is the only one which has been shown to be thoroughly consistent
at any order in perturbation theory if cyclicity of the trace is not given up (see ref. [16]
for the non-cyclic trace alternative). minimal subtraction [11] of the singular part of the
dimensionally regularized feynman diagrams, a subtraction procedure known as minimal
dimensional renormalization [3,4,5,6], leads to a renormalized quantum eld theory that
satises hepp axioms [20] of renormalization theory. field equations, the action principles
and zimmerman-bonneau identities hold in dimensional renormalization. this has been
rigorously shown in refs. [3,4,5,6,7,17] and it constitutes one of the key ingredients of the
modern approach to the quantization of gauge theories by using brs methods [18,19].

that dimensional regularization can be used along with algebraic brs techniques
is of the utmost importance, for this regularization method and the minimal subtraction
algorithm that comes with it break, generally speaking, chiral gauge symmetries. this
breaking gives rise to both physical and non-physical anomalies [7,21]. physical anomalies
in the currents of the lagrangian impose anomaly cancellation conditions [23], lest the the-
ory ceases to make sense as a quantum theory. these anomalies belong to the cohomology
of the slavnov-taylor operator that governs the chiral gauge symmetry at the quantum
level and they are not artifacts of the regularization method nor due to the renormalization
scheme employed. non-physical anomalies correspond to trivial objects in the cohomology
of the brs operator and, therefore, they can be set to zero by an appropriate choice of
nite counterterms [21]. non-physical anomalies are artifacts either of the regularization
method, the renormalization method or both.

notwithstanding the unique status that as a thoroughly consistent framework the
breitenlohner and maison scheme enjoys among the dimensional renormalization prescrip-
tions, there is, up to the best of our knowledge, no complete one-loop study of a general
non-abelian chiral gauge theory, let alone the standard model. most of the implemen-
tations of dimensional regularization in quantum eld theories which involve the matrix
5 and are anomally-free, e.g. the standard model, take a fully anticommuting 5 in d
complex dimensions. this is the so-called naive prescription for the object 5 [22]. the
purpose of this paper is to remedy this situation by carrying out such one-loop study for
a general chiral gauge theory with neither scalar nor majorana elds. the inclusion of
scalar elds will be discussed elsewhere.

the layout of this paper is as follow.

in section 2 we give a quick account of the
dimensional renormalization algorithm a la breitenlohner and maison, the regularized
and quantum action principles and bonneau identities. section 3 is devoted to a thorough
study of the one-loop dimensional renormalization of a general chiral gauge theory for a
simple gauge group. in this section the brs anomaly is computed for the rst time in
the breitenlohner and maison framework. of course, the standard anomaly cancellation
conditions are thus obtained. the beta function and the anomalous dimensions of the

2

theory are computed in this section as well. again, the one-loop renormalization group
equation for the model at hand had never been work out as yet in breitenlohner and
maison scheme. in section 4 we adapt the results obtained in the previous section to the
case of a non-simple gauge group. we also include three appendices. in appendices a
and b we show how to use the action principles to obtain the breaking of the slavnov-
taylor identities.
in appendix c we compare, for a simple gauge group, the one-loop
renormalized chiral gauge theory obtained by means of the breitenlohner and maison
scheme with the corresponding one-loop renormalized theory obtained with the help of an
fully anticommuting 5 in d complex dimensions.

2. dimensional renormalization: notation and general results

as explained in the introduction, we will use the formulation of dimensional renormal-
ization given by breitenlohner and maison [3,4,5], because it is a systematic and consistent
procedure (valid in the sense of hepp [20] to all orders in perturbation theory) in which
tools like eld equations, action principles and ward identities can be rigorously imple-
mented. this applies specially to the treatment of 5.

we will also compare breitenlohner and maison formulation with the naive pre-

scription which sets the object 5 to anticommute with the object [22].

2.1. the breitenlohner and maison d-dimensional covariants

breitenlohner and maison dene the usual d-dimensional lorentz covariants (g,
p, , etc..) to be formal objects obeying the standard algebraic identities that they
would satisfy in spaces of integral dimension [3] (d is a complex number, indices do not
take any value and questions like of lorentz invariance are meaningless !).

besides the d-dimensional metrics g, they introduce a new one, g , which can
be considered as a (d  4)-dimensional covariant. moreover the  tensor is considered to
be a 4 dimensional covariant object (because of axiom in eq. (2) below).

the symbols are required to obey (apart from obvious rules concerning contractions

of indices, addition, multiplication by numbers, commutation of some symbols, etc.):

gp = p,

and the assumption of cyclicity of the symbol tr, the following properties can be proved
algebraically [3]

5 = ii,

{5, } = {5, } = 25 = 25,
[5, ] = [5, ] = 25 = 25,
{5, } = [5, ] = 0.

(4)

(5)

g can be thought of as a projector over the 4-dimensional space and g as a

projector over the (d  4)-dimensional one.

all usual formulae (not involving 5) used for computing traces of strings of gammas
in terms of combinations of the metric remain valid, even when the gammas are hatted
or barred: in these cases one has only to put hats or bars over the corresponding metrics.
also the trace of an odd number of (normal, hatted or barred) s vanish.

strings of gammas with contracted indices are simplied with the aid of formulae like:

 = (2  d),
  = 2 ,
  = (6  d),

  = 4 ,
  = (4  d).

of course, when 5 of the  tensor appear the situation is very dierent. in the naive
prescription, one assumes the anticommutativity of 5: {, 5} = 0, and the cyclicity of
the trace. from these assumptions one obtains [3,10,14,21]

2d tr[5] = 0,
2(d  2) tr[1 25] = 0
2(d  4) tr[1 . . . 45] = 0

if d 6= 0,
if d 6= 0, 2;

(6)

which has the consequence that tr[1 . . . 4 5] is identically 0 in the dimensionally regu-
larized theory (d 6= 4). so, it also vanishes in the dimensionally renormalized theory, which

4

is incompatible with the true property (see eq. (4)) in four dimensions. we could introduce
the symbol  with the requirement that it satises eq. (4), but then the symbol  would
be identically 0. despite this well known fact, people use the naive prescription in e.g.
the standard model, but they do not set  equal to 0 and at the end of calculations the
symbol  is supposed to have its usual meaning as the levi-civita tensor. this is clearly
a mathematical inconsistency (the axioms are not compatible) and when mathematical
inconsistencies are present, results obtained from the axioms are ambiguous and cannot
be trusted.

eq. (6) is obtained by computing tr [1 . . . m5] in two dierent ways: rst,
one contracts the index  without moving around the 5 and, second, one anticommutes
the  which is next to the 5 with this very 5 and puts it on the left thanks to the
cyclicity of the trace; then, one anticommutes it to the right through the rest of s until
the other  is met, contraction of the index  is now carried out. so, at least the trace
of six s, having two indices contracted, and a 5 are needed to obtain this inconsistency.
here, the ambiguity in the results is a consequence of the choice of the position of the

5. for example, if the 5 is not moved in any case,

tr [1 . . . 45] = d tr [1 . . . 45],

6= tr [1 . . . 4 5] = (8  d) tr [1 . . . 45],

(7)

unless the trace of four s and one 5 (or the  tensor) is 0.

notice that the ambiguity will be always proportional to (d  4) or a (d  4) object
like , but there are poles in (d  4) in the divergent diagrams that will make nite this
ambiguity in the dimensionally renormalized theory, even in one loop calculations.

then, why do people go on using the naive prescription in calculations of, e.g.
standard model? the key is that the ambiguities are claimed to be always proportional
to the coecient of the (chiral gauge) anomaly. so, it would appear that one could freely
use the naive prescription in theories with cancellation of anomalies (like the standard
model). calculations to low orders in perturbation theory in some models support this
idea but there is not a rigorous proof of it valid to all orders in perturbation theory. (also,
it seems dicult to build a consistent theory with inconsistent elements).

we shall close this subsection with a few words regarding the construction of lorentz
covariants due to wilson and collins [24,10]. it is worth mentioning it since it furnishes
explicit expressions for the lorentz covariants satisfying eqs. (1)-(2), thus showing that no
inconsistencies arise. in this construction gamma matrices are represented as innite
dimensional objects. the matrix 5 being dened by eq. (3), with 1...4 as dened by
eq. (2). however, we will not use this construction but the algebraic approach of abstract
symbols by breitenlohner and maison.

2.2. minimal dimensional renormalization and the renormalized theory

dimensional renormalization a la breitenlohner and maison is carried out by applying
the pole subtraction algorithm [3,4,5,6] as given by the forest formula to each dimensionally
regularized 1pi feynman diagram. this algorithm can also be implemented by adding to
the d-dimensional lagrangian (see below) counterterms whose coecients have poles at

5

d = 4. both the set of dimensionally regularized feynman diagrams, which conforms what
is referred to as the regularized theory, and the renormalized 1pi functional obtained from
them are best established in the following way:

i) write a classical, i.e. order zero in h, action, s0, in d space-time dimensions (d
being a generic positive integer) which yield the four dimensional action of the theory
when the formal limit d  4 is taken. the d-dimensional covariants in s0 are
dened as in the previous subsection. we shall assume as in ref. [3] that each free
2 d, in s0 is such that d1 is the same algebraic expression as in four
dimensions, although it is expressed in terms of d-dimensional covariants.  denotes
a collection of bosonic or fermionic elds. ihd1 gives the free propagator. s0 will
be referred to as the dimensional regularization classical action. we shall call the
d-dimensional space-time used above to set the dimensional regularization classical
action, s0, the d-dimensional space-time of dimensional regularization.

term, r ddx 1

ii) use the dimensional regularization classical action, s0, along with standard path
integrals textbook techniques, formally applied, to obtain the set of d-dimensional
feynman rules stemming from it. these feynman rules will lead to the collection
of feynman diagrams in the d-dimensional space-time of dimensional regularization,
d being a generic positive integer, which is to be turned into the dimensionally reg-
ularized feynman diagrams by using the algorithms in refs. [3,4,5,10]. this set of
dimensionally regularized feynman diagrams denes the regularized theory.

iii) introduce the dimensional regularization generating functional zdreg[j; k; ]:

zdreg[j; k; ] = z d exp{

i
h

( s0[; k; ] +z ddx ji(x)i(x) )},

(8)

where the right hand side of eq. (8) is dened as the formal power expansion in h, k
and j given by the feynman diagrams obtained by using the d-dimensional feynman
rules previously established. the symbols k and  denote, respectively, any external
eld, usually coupled linearly to composite operators, and any parameter occurring in
the action. let us stress that eq. (8) is merely a symbol which denotes the whole set of
feynman diagrams in the d-dimensional space-time of dimensional regularization,
d being a generic positive integer, which are converted into dimensionally regularized
feynman diagrams by analytic continuation in d. however, this symbol is very useful
due to the regularized action principle [3,4,5] discussed below. indeed, the standard
formal manipulations of the path integral, e.g variations of elds and dierentiation
with respect to parameters, that in four dimensions lead to equations of motion, ward
identities and so on, can be formally performed in the path integral in eq. (8); thus
leading to formal functional equations involving zdreg. these formal manipulations
are mathematically well dened if expressed in terms of the dimensionally regularized
feynman diagrams arising from the right hand side of eq. (8), and the formal func-
tional equations they lead to are also mathematically sound if they are considered as
symbols denoting in a condensed manner the equations veried by the corresponding
dimensionally regularized feynman diagrams. these equations are the dimensionally
regularized counterparts of the four dimensional equations of motion, ward identi-
ties, etc. it is also useful to introduce the dimensional regularization 1pi functional,

6

dreg[; k; ], which can be obtained from eq. (8) through formal legendre trans-
form; a procedure well dened in terms of regularized feynman diagrams. again, the
regularized action principle guarantees that the formal functional equations veried
by dreg[; k; ] make sense mathematically when expressed in terms of dimension-
ally regularized feynman diagrams. we shall refer to the formal equations satised
by zdreg and dreg as dimensionally regularized equations, keeping always in mind
the previous discussion.

iv) if there are classical symmetries in the four dimensional classical theory that should
hold in the quantum theory, one generalizes next the corresponding eld transfor-
mations to the d-dimensional space-time of dimensional regularization. objects
in this d dimensional space-time should be dened according to the algebra of d-
dimensional covariants given in the previous subsection. the eld transformations
in the d-dimensional space-time thus obtained should yield, in the limit d  4, the
classical four dimensional transformations. generally speaking, the transformations in
the d dimensional space-time of dimensional regularization do not leave invariant the
dimensional regularization classical action s0. this lack of invariance will make the
dimensional regularization generating functionals, zdreg and dreg, satisfy anoma-
lous ward identities, which can be derived (see appendix a) by performing formal
manipulations of the path integral in eq. (8). again, the regularized action principle
guarantees that both these formal manipulations and the identities they lead to have
a well dened mathematical meaning when expressed in terms of dimensionally reg-
ularized feynman diagrams. the dimensionally regularized identities so obtained are
of enormous help in the computation of the anomalous breaking terms of the dimen-
sionally renormalized four dimensional theory (see next subsection), which otherwise
would have to be computed by evaluating the complete dimensionally renormalized
1pi functional.

v) the minimal subtraction algorithm of references [3,6] is applied next to every dimen-
sionally regularized feynman diagram coming from the 1pi functional dreg[; k; ].
the minimally renormalized 1pi functional minren[; k; ; ] ( stands for the di-
mensional regularization scale) is obtained by taking the limit d  4, rst, and then
setting every hatted object to zero in every subtracted 1pi diagram. the minimal
subtraction algorithm amounts to subtracting the pole at d = 4 from every diagram
once subdivergences have been taken care of, and it can be formulated in terms of
singular, at d = 4, counterterms [3] added to the dimensional regularization classical
action s0. these singular counterterms, which can be read from the forest formula
[3,10], are local polynomials of the elds and their derivatives in the d-dimensional,
with d 6= 4, space-time of dimensional regularization. the coecients of these poly-
nomials are the principal part at d = 4 of a certain meromorphic function of complex
d. the singular counterterms in question give rise to new d-dimensional vertices,
which in turn yield new feynman diagrams that cancel, after dimensionally regular-
ized, the singular behaviour of the dimensionally regularized diagrams provided by
s0.
according to ref. [6] the dimensional regularization scale, , is introduced by replacing
every loop momentum measure ddp
(2)d before applying the subtraction

(2)d with 4d ddp

7

algorithm.
if one follows the procedure of singular counterterms, the previous re-
placement should be made regardless the diagram involves singular counterterms.
the introduction of the scale  will render dimensionally homogeneous the laurent
expansion around d = 4 of a given dimensionally regularized diagram.
unfortunately, if there is a symmetry we wanted preserved at the quantum level, the
renormalized functional minren[; k; ; ] would not do, since it would not dene, in
general, a quantum theory having such a symmetry: the regularization and also the
subtraction process may break the symmetry. however, the situation is not hopeless.
algebraic brs renormalization along with the quantum action principle [18] comes in
our aid: if the anomaly cancellation conditions [23] are met, the anomalous breaking
terms, called spurious, can be canceled at each order in h by adding appropriate
counterterms to the four dimensional classical action of the theory.

sct , where s(n)

suppose that n is the order in the h expansion at which a non-anomalous symmetry is
broken for the rst time in the dimensionally renormalized theory. then,
vi) compute the breaking, which will be a local four dimensional functional, with the help
of the action principles and the bonneau identities [6,7,8]. this can be easily done (see
next subsection) by taking as action, not the classical one, s0, but a new action s(n) =
s0 + s(n)
sct denotes the set of singular counterterms needed to minimally
renormalize the theory at order hn, and then redo steps i) to v). indeed, if d 6= 4, the
regularized action principle still holds for the dimensional regularization generating
functionals, zdreg[j; k; ] and dreg[; k; ], dened for s(n), and, hence, we can
take advantage of the dimensionally regularized equations, in the sense explained in
ii), to obtain the renormalized equations veried by minren[; k; ; ].
next, extract from the breaking the four dimensional nite counterterms needed to
restore the symmetry, generalize them to d space-time dimensions with the help of the
algebra of d-dimensional covariants (we shall denote this generalization by s(n)
fct ), and
add them to the action s(n) to obtain yet another new action s(n)
sct +
fct . s(n)
s(n)
dreg will be called the dimensional regularization action. furnished with
this new action s(n)
dreg, establish then new perturbation theory: redo steps i) to v)
upon replacing s0 with s(n)
dreg. the new renormalized 1pi functional, ren[; k; ; ],
will satisfy up to order hn the ward identities that govern the given symmetry at the
quantum level. move on to vi) and compute the breaking at order hn+1, and so on
and so forth.

dreg = s0 + s(n)

vii) use the bonneau [6,7] identities to obtain the renormalization group equation at every
order in the perturbative expansion for the theory being analyzed. thus the beta
functions and anomalous dimensions of the theory will be evaluated.

let us close this subsection by making some remarks on the generalization to d space-
time dimensions, i.e. to the d-dimensional space-time of dimensional regularization, of
the four dimensional classical action, the four dimensional counterterms needed to restore
non-anomalous symmetries and the four dimensional symmetry transformations.
if the
classical action of the theory involves objects whose properties depend on the dimension of
space-time (e.g. 5, the levi-civita symbol,...) there is no canonical dimensional regular-
ization classical action, s0, in d space-time dimensions. any local functional which formally

8

go to the four dimensional classical action as d  4 would do, provided the free terms of
the former lead to the propagators described in i). for instance, let 1 and 2 be a couple
of positive real numbers, then, the four dimensional metric and gamma matrices in the in-
teraction part of the four dimensional classical action can be replaced with g +1g and
 + 2, respectively, to obtain an admissible biparametric family of dimensional reg-
ularization classical actions. each member of this family yields a particular regularization
of the theory, this situation is somewhat reminiscent of the lattice regularization method.
generally speaking the dierence between two admissible d-dimensional lagrangians will
always be a local evanescent operator vanishing as the coupling constants go to zero.
analogously, in the type of theories under scrutiny, namely, chiral gauge theories , there is
no canonical generalization to d-dimensional space-time of dimensional regularization of
the four dimensional nite counterterms needed to restore a non-anomalous broken symme-
try. again, two such generalizations of a given four dimensional nite counterterm which
agree up to order hn1 will dier in a d-dimensional integrated evanescent operator of
order hn. however, the dependence on the choice of generalization will show in the renor-
malized theory at order hn+1, never at order hn. last, but not least, from the point of view
of renormalization, there is no canonical generalization to d space-time dimensions of the
symmetry transformations of the elds for theories which are not vector-like. again, two
such generalizations dier in an evanescent operator. however, this arbitrariness in the
choice of dimensional regularization classical action, d-dimensional nite counterterms
and symmetry transformations is useful since one can play around with it so as to simplify
the form of the symmetry breaking contributions. finally, for vector-like theories such as
qcd, there is, of course, a canonical choice of dimensional regularization classical action
and vector-like transformations: the usual one [10].

2.3. regularized and quantum action principles

as we said in the previous subsection, one of the main characteristics of the dimen-
sional renormalization procedure is that action principles are precisely stated and proved
[3-5]. these principles are most eciently expressed in terms of the dimensional reg-
ularization generating functional, zdreg[j; k; ], for the greens function given by the
gell-mann-low series and the dimensional renormalization 1pi functional, ren[; k; ; ],
obtained from it (see previous subsection).

let us take as dimensional regularization action (see vi) in the previous subsection)

s(n)
dreg = sfree[; ] + sint[; k; ],

(9)

where  denotes a collection of commuting or anticommuting quantum elds, k set of
commuting or anti-commuting external elds,  is a generic parameter, and

sfree[; ] = s0free[; ],
sint[; k; ] = s0int[; k; ] + s(n)

sct [; k; ] + s(n)

fct [; k; ].

 an evanescent operator is an operator whose tree level contribution vanishes as

d  4.

9

we next introduce

sint[, j, k, ] = sint[, k, ] +z ddx ji(x)i(x)

and dene, following eq. (8), the functional zdreg

zdreg[j; k; ] =z d exp{

i
h

(s(n)

dreg +z jii)} (cid:10)expn i

h

sint[; j; k; ]o(cid:11)0.

(10)

the symbol exp in the previous equation stands for its formal power series and the symbol
h  i0 denotes the usual vacuum expectation value

h  i0 =z d    exp{

i
h

s0free[; ]},

dened by gaussian integration, which gives a formal power series in h and the external
elds j and k. each coecient of this series is a sum of d-dimensional feynman
diagrams. every d-dimensional feynman diagram can be converted into a meromorphic
function of d by promoting d to a complex variable and understanding the d-dimensional
covariants as in subsection 2.1.

now, the regularized action principle states that the following three functional equa-

tions hold in the dimensionally regularized theory:

1) arbitrary polynomial variations of the quantized elds , (x) = (x) p ((x))
leave zdreg invariant and

zdreg[j, k] (cid:10)(sfree + sint) expn i

h

sint[, j, k, ]o(cid:11)0 = 0,

where the variations are the linear parts in .
2) variations of external elds e(x)  (k(x), j(x)) give

(13)

let us explain in what sense are the functional equations (11), (12) and (13) math-
ematically meaningful. first, these equations are to be understood diagramatically only.
the formal expansion in powers of h, k and j of both sides of each equation leads to
an innite set of equations involving only d-dimensional feynman diagrams. it is this
innite set of diagramatic equations in the d-dimensional space-time of dimensional reg-
ularization what is taken as the denition of the corresponding functional equation. the
regularized action principle [3,6] states that this very set of diagramatic equations still

10

holds if every formal d-dimensional feynman diagram in them is replaced with its di-
mensionally regularized counterpart, with the scale  introduced as explained in 2.2.v).
a mathematically sound set of equations is thus obtained. of course, it is easier to handle
the functional equations above than their dimensionally regularized diagramatic denition.
furthermore, this functional equations can be deduced by formal path integral manipu-
lations, which in turn can be given a diagramatic denition valid within the dimensional
regularization method a la breitenlohner and maison. let us nally note that the limit
d  4 of dimensionally regularized the green functions coming from the right hand side
of eqs. (12) and (13) does exist at each order in the h expansion up to order n. notice
that we have included in the action s(n)
dreg, dened in eq. (9), the appropriate singular
counterterms up to order hn. hence, eqs. (12) and (13) have a well-dened d  4 limit up
to order hn and can be used to compute the variations with e(x) and  of the renormalized
functional zren[j; k; ] up to order hn.

the regularized action principle given by eqs. (11), (12) and (13) leads [3,6,7,10] to
the quantum action principle (see ref. [25] and references therein) which states that the
following functional equations hold for the dimensionally renormalized theory:

where the symbols n[  ] and n[  ]ren denote normal product as dened in refs. [6,7,10]
and its insertion in the renormalized 1pi functional, respectively. n[o(x)] is a local
normal product of ultraviolet dimension 4  dim() + dim(). s0 and s(n)
fct have been
dened in i) and v) of subsection 2.2.
eqs. (14)-(17)have been shown to hold by using the forest formula [3,4,6,7] and the
singular counterterms algorithm [10], respectively. of course, both proofs are equivalent.

 the scale  is introduced so as to render dimensionally homogeneous the laurent

expansions around d = 4.

11

the quantum action principle is of the utmost importance to the renormalization
of brs symmetries [18], for it guarantees (see qap1 and qap2) that the breaking of
such symmetry is given by the insertion into the dimensionally renormalized 1pi ren of a

certain integrated normal operator, n[o] =r d4x n[o(x)], where n[o(x)] is a local normal

operator of ultraviolet dimension 4  dim() + dim(s) and ghost number 1. indeed, the
following equation holds for ren[, ; k]

in the previous equation  and  stand for elds which
undergo linear and non-linear brs transformations, respectively. as it is customary s
denotes a brs transformation. k stands for the external eld coupled to the non-linear
brs transformation s in the four-dimensional classical action [18].

now, if nite counterterms have been added to the four-dimensional classical action
so that the brs symmetry is preserved up to order hn1 (i.e. the rst non-vanishing
contribution to the right hand side of eq. (18) is order hn), eq. (18) reads

s(ren) = n[o](n) + o(hn+1).

where n[o](n) is the contribution to n[o] of order hn. we have taken into account that
n[o]  ren = n[o](n) + o(h n[o](n)), since by assumption n[o]  ren = o(hn).

next, if n[o](n) = hn b sfct,n (i.e. n[o](n) is b-exact) for some four-dimensional
integrated local functional of the elds, the brs symmetry can be restored, up to order
hn, by adding to the four-dimensional classical action the nite counterterm sfct,n [18].
here b denotes the linearized brs operator:

ren is the order h0 contribution to ren, i.e. the brs invariant classical four dimen-
m=1 hmsfct,m. of course, if n[o](n) is not b-exact

and (0)
sional action. then, we set s(n)
the theory is anomalous at order hn.

the computation of the right hand side of eq. (18), breaking, is the issue we will
discuss now. one can always compute the complete 1pi functional ren at each order in h,
insert it in the left hand side of equation (18), work out the functional derivatives and thus
obtain the right hand side. this method is, of course, very impractical. the regularized
action principle, as given in eqs. (11) and (12), provides us with a more ecient way to
compute the symmetry breaking term of the brs symmetry. indeed, in appendix a we
show that the following functional equation hold, in the same sense as eqs. (11) and (12),
for the 1pi formal functional dreg

were dreg is the 1pi functional computed with the dimensional regularization action,
s(n)
dreg, dened at the beginning of the current subsection. the symbol sd denotes the
generalization to d dimensions of the four-dimensional brs transformations (see 2.2.iv)).
the operators  and ct are given by  = sds0 and ct = sds(n)
ct , respectively. here,
s0 = s0f ree + s0int and s(n)
sct (see eq. (9) and the paragraph below it for
denitions).

ct = s(n)

fct + s(n)

let us recall that dreg is dened as a formal series expansion in powers of h and the
elds ,  and k. the coecients of this power series are 1pi green functions of the
theory at a given order in h. taking into account that dreg contains the contributions
coming from the singular counterterms up to order hn, denoted by s(n)
sct , one concludes that
the dimensionally regularized 1pi green functions obtained from dreg are nite in the
limit d  4 up to order hn. these 1pi green functions are the dimensionally renormalized
1pi green functions upon introduction of the dimensional regularization scale  (see
subsection 2.2.). hence, up to order hn, one may formally write

limd4 dreg[, ; k; ] = ren[, ; k; ]

(20)

in the previous equation, limd4 is dened by the following process: one takes rst the
limit d  4 of the dimensionally regularized 1pi green functions and then sets to zero
(d  4)-dimensional covariant). recall that the dimensional
every hatted object (i.e.
regularization scale, , is introduced by hand to render dimensionally homogeneous the
regularized green functions upon laurent expansion around d = 4 [6].

now, by taking limd4 of the left hand side of eq. (19) after discarding any contri-
bution of order greater than hn, and bearing in mind eq. (20), one obtains the left hand
side of eq. (18) up to order hn. hence, breaking in the latter equation is given by

breaking = limd4n  dreg + ct  dreg +z ddx(cid:2) s(n)

k(x)

ct

 dreg(cid:3) dreg

of course, the previous equation only makes sense up to order hn. the order h contribution
to eq. (21) reads particularly simple since sds0 is an evanescent operator (there is no o(h0)
contribution to n[] thereby) and the lowest order contribution to sct is order h:

by vanishing terms we mean contributions that vanish as d is send to 4 rst and then

there are some comments regarding eq. (22) which we would like to make. first, if the
theory is not anomalous, the nite counterterms in s(1)
breaking = 0
[18]. second, there are two possible sources of symmetry breaking in eq. (22). one is the
regularization method; in particular, the dimensional regularization classical action, s0,
one began with. the other is the minimal subtraction algorithm (i.e. the renormalization
algorithm) we are employing. that the regularization method breaks the symmetry shows
. the subtraction algorithm

fct can be chosen so that (1)

need not be zero either, as we shall discuss in section 3. of course, this limit yields
a nite local four-dimensional functional of the elds and their derivatives. fourth, the
operator  = sds0 being evanescent ushers in the techniques introduced by bonneau
[6,7] to express normal products of evanescent operators, also called anomalous normal
products, in terms of a basis of standard (non-evenescent operators) normal products. we
shall address this subject in the next subsection. suce it to say that expansion of the
normal product of an evanescent operator in terms of standard normal products has
coecients that are series expansions in h with no o(h) term. hence, there is no breaking
is, in agreement with the quantum

of the brs symmetry at order h0 and(cid:2)n[]  ren(cid:3)(1)

we shall nally recall that the equation of motion holds in dimensional renormalization

[3,6,10]:

(24)

where s(n)
dreg are dened in subsection 2.2. and eq. (9). the superscript  tell
us that the singular counterterms needed to minimally renormalize the theory at any order
in h have been included; however, one has added nite counterterms only up to order hn.
eq. (24) can obtained from qap3 (eq. (16)) by setting (x) to 1. alternatively, eq. (11),
for p ((x)) = 1, leads to eq. (24).

the use of both the equation of motion of the ghost eld and the equation of motion
of the auxiliary eld coupled to the gauge xing condition simplies the renormalization
of theories with brs symmetries.

2.4. expression of anomalous terms with the aid of bonneau identities

the computation of the insertions of normal products of evanescent operators, also
called anomalous normal products, are, in dimensional renormalization, of key importance
to the calculation of the symmetry breaking terms in ward identities [6,10]. we shall see
(see eq. (22)) yields both the essential and the

spurious brs anomalies for the regularized theory we will consider. the purpose of the
current subsection is to summarily recall that the normal product of an evanescent operator
can be expressed as linear combinations of normal products of standard (non-evanescent)
operators. further details can be found in refs. [6,7,8].

in renormalized perturbation theory, any set of insertions of quantum operators such
that their classical approximations form a basis in the linear space of classical operators of
dimensions bounded by d is also a basis in the linear space of insertions, with dimension
bounded by the same d, of quantum operators [18]. so, in dimensional renormalization,
if {oi} form such a basis in the space of classical operators, then {n[oi]  ren}, where oi
is any of the possible generalizations to d dimensions of the corresponding classical four-
dimensional operator, is a basis in the space of quantum insertions. we will call standard
operators the operators in the d-dimensional space-time of dimensional regularization
which are generalizations of the classical operators in four dimensions. these standard
operators are obtained with the help of the algebra d-dimensional covariants and they
are non-evanescent. hence, n[oi]  ren is an insertion of an standard normal product.

it is thus expected that anomalous normal products, i.e. normal products of non-
evanescent operators minimally subtracted should be decomposable in terms of some basis
of standard normal products, minimally subtracted again. this was shown by bonneau
[8] who, remarkably, proved a linear system of zimmerman-like identities which expresses
a decomposition of any anomalous normal product on all possible normal products of
monomials of operators, including standard and anomalous ones.

if there is only a scalar eld, the bonneau identities have the form

n[go](x)  ren = 

4

xn

4n

1ij n

xr x{i1 ... ir }
ir (cid:10) (p1) . . . (pn) n[go](cid:11)1pi(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)pig0(cid:27)

where the tilde indicates fourier transformed elds, the bar means that only the minimal
subtraction of the subdivergences has been done, r.s.p. stands for residue of the simple
pole in  = 4  d (this is the reason why the global sign 1 occurs: g
 =  ) and the 
symbol means that the tensorial structure {. . .} really appears inside the normal product.
of course, any colour or pure number factor can be taken out of the normal product,
but note that g n[o] = n[go ] 6= n[go ], the dierence being the anomalous
normal product n[go ], which need not vanish.

notice that the sum in n is a sum in the number of elds in the monomial and the

sum in r, a sum in the number of derivatives in the mononial.

the tensor g is a new one, which has been introduced in order to simplify the calcu-

lations. its properties are:

g = g ,

g

 = 1,

15

 = gg

gg
gg = 0,

 = g
n[go ] = gn[o ].

eq. (25) is easily generalized when there are several elds, not necessarily scalar,
involved. one just sums over all kind of elds, taking special care of the symmetry factors
and the fermionic signs. we shall give below the generalization of eq. (25) that is relevant
to our computations in subsection 3.5.

due to the fact that all subdivergences have been previously subtracted, the barred
1pi function of eq. (25) has a polynomial singular part. we are interested in the coecients
of the simple pole. these coecients will be in general combinations of metrics, constants
and colour factors. in vector-like gauge theories with the usual regularizations, its tensorial
structure will involve only usual metrics, which combined with the tensor indices of the
normal product will get the expansions of the anomalous normal product in terms of a
basis of standard monomial normal products. however, if in the regularized theory or in
the calculations some hatted objects appear, then the bonneau identities (eq. (25)) would
express any anomalous normal product in terms of a collection of standard (mi) and also
evanescent ( mj) monomial normal products. that is

n[go](x)  ren =xi

i n[mi](x)  ren +xj

j n[ mj](x)  ren.

therefore, the rest of independent anomalous monomials should be also expanded by a
similar formula, then getting a system of identities.

but notice that the left hand side of the bonneau identities and also the coecients
given by the r.s.p. of the right hand side are both of order h1, in the least. therefore, the
bonneau identities are not a trivial system but a linear system whose unique solution give
the desired expansion of any anomalous operator in terms of a quantum basis of standard
insertions:

n[go](x)  ren =xi

qi n[mi](x)  ren.

of course, the coecients qi are formal series in h.

clearly, at lowest order the linear system is decoupled and has an easy interpretation:
the loops with the anomalous insertion are replaced with sums of tree diagrams corre-
sponding to insertion of standard operators, but with coecients of order h1. this will be
most relevant to our computations below. in general, for the calculation of qi at order hm,
it is needed the coecients i up to order hm and the coecients i up to order h(m1).

general chiral non-abelian gauge theory with neither majorana nor scalar elds. we shall

3.2.the dimensional regularization action

we shall now follow i) of subsection 2.2. and set the dimensional regularization
classical action s0. the kinetic terms are uniquely dened, not so the interaction terms.
notice, for instance, that the dirac matrix part of the left-handed-fermion-gauge-boson
vertex has the following equivalent forms in 4 dimensions: pl = pr = prpl. all
these forms are dierent in the d-dimensional space-time of dimensional regularization
because of the non-anticommutativity of 5. of course, the generalization of the interaction
to the dimensional regularization space is not unique, and any choice is equally correct,
although some choices will be more convenient than others.

we choose the following generalization of sinv:

we next generalize, in the obvious way, to the d-dimensional space-time of dimen-
sional regularization the brs variations (which we will denote by sd and call dimensional
regularization brs variations) and the gauge-xing terms. the dimensional regulariza-
tion brs transformations read

sd = iat a
sd = iat a
sda = ,
sd = 0,

l pra,
rpla,

(31)

sd = i2,

sd  = b,

sdb = 0,

sd = 0,

sdl = sd l = sdr = sd r = 0.

notice that we have chosen the dimensional regularization brs transformations so
that no explicit evanescent operator occurs in them. this will certainly simplify the com-
putation of the anomalous breaking term in brs identities for the minimally renormalized
theory. we refer the reader to appendix b for the discussion of the computation of the
brs anomalous breaking term when the dimensional regularization brs transformations
involve coecients that vanish as d  4.

in summary, our dimensional regularization classical action, s0, has the following

figure 1. feynman rule of the insertion of the non-integrated breaking eq. (34)

notice that if the fermion representation(s) were compatible with a cp invariance of
the classical action, then the dimensional regularization action with this choice of chiral
vertex would also be formally cp invariant, and the breaking eq. (34) would have a denite
cp value (+1 if we assign (l(r)) = (l(r))t, 1 if we assign (l(r)) = (l(r))t, where
l(r)  atl(r) and t stands for transposition of the colour matrices).

the breaking is an (implicit) (d4)-object, i.e. an evanescent operator, and, clearly,
this would be also true for any other choice dimensional regularization classical action.
for example, if we had chosen as the regularized interaction

the breaking would have been

which is certainly more involved. (and with this vertex, the formal cp invariance of the
dimensional regularization classical action for cp invariant classical actions would be
lost).

remember that in the breitenlohner and maison prescription  anticommutes whereas
 commutes with 5; so, in general the algebraic manipulations of the strings of s would
be a bit more tedious with the second kind of vertex because  =  + .

obviously, due to the fact that these two vertices are dierent, the results obtained by
using minimal subtraction would be dierent they would be two dierent renormalization
schemesand they should be related by nite terms. moreover, in general, it should be
expected that both results are dierent from the one obtained with the usual naive
prescription of an anticommuting 5 every time a fermionic loop occurs. but the hermitian
vertex of ref. [26] is not the only correct one as claimed there, but also any other one
diering from it by a evanescent operator of dimension 4 as correctly remarked in [27].

the fact that in general the results obtained by minimal subtraction a la breitenlohner
and maison in theories with cancellation of anomalies do not satisfy the ward identities is a
drawback from the practical point of view but not a reason to cast doubt on breitenlohner
and maison schemes [28]. indeed, we should always remember that we have the freedom
to add any nite counterterm to restore the identities. and in theories with anomalies the
mathematical rigour of the regularization scheme we are considering has not been surpassed
by any other dimensional regularization prescription .

furnished with the action s0 given in eq. (32) one next develops a dimensionally
regularized perturbation theory by following steps i) to iv) in subsection 2.2. this regular-
ized theory is not invariant under the dimensional regularization brs transformations in
eq. (31). indeed, the dimensional regularization 1pi functional 0 obtained from s0 sat-
ises anomalous brs identities, the symmetry breaking terms being given by the insertion
in 0 of the operator  in eq. (34).

since our ultimate goal is to obtain a brs invariant theory (if the anomaly cancellation
conditions [23] are met) we shall further proceed and develop a dimensionally regularized
perturbation theory by using the following action

s(n)
dreg = s0 + s(n)

sct + s(n)
fct ,

ct , s(n)

ct = s(n)

(35)

instead of the dimensional regularization classical action s0. we have named, in sub-
section 2.2., s(n)
dreg the dimensional regularization action (at order hn). it is computed
order by order in the perturbative expansion in h by proceeding as in steps v) to vii) of
subsection 2.2. let us recall that s(n)
sct denotes the singular (at d = 4) counterterms needed
to minimally renormalize the theory dimensionally up to order hn, whereas s(n)
fct stands for
the nite (at d = 4) counterterms needed to turn the minimally renormalized theory into
a brs invariant theory up to order hn. in this paper we shall be concerned only with the
renormalized theory at order h. hence, we will just compute s(1)

sct and s(1)
fct .

note that we have denoted by 0, instead of dreg, the dimensional regularization
1pi functional for s0 to avoid confusion with the dimensional regularization 1pi functional
for s(n)

dreg, which shall denote by dreg.

dimensional regularization 1pi functional obtained from s0. s0 is given in eq. (32). then,

given in eq. (34). the symbol ct is equal to sds(n)
ct and sd are dened in
eqs. (35) and (31), respectively. eq. (40) is a particular instance of eq. (19), and it is
obtained by considering the concrete realization of the dimensional regularization brs
transformations given in eq. (31). this equation is a rigorous equation, valid to all orders
in the expansion in powers of h and elds.

is not zero. this term is the symmetry breaking term of the dimensionally regularized

we have to ask now about the renormalized counterpart of eq. (40). since s(n)

dreg
contains the singular counterterms needed to render non-singular at d = 4 the 1pi functions

27

of the theory up to order hn, eq. (20) denes the renormalized 1pi functional ren up to
order hn:

limd4 dreg[, ; k; ] = ren[, ; k; ].

(41)

let us recall that the limiting process denoted by limd4 is acomplished by taking the
ordinary limit d  4 rst and then replacing with zero every hatted object. the dimen-
sional regularization scale has been introduced by hand as explained in v) of subsection
2.2.

now, by particularizing eqs. (18)(20) to the eld theory under study, one concludes
that the following equation, which is the renormalized counterpart of eq. (40), holds up to
order hn:

  o = breaking, (42)

where ren is the dimensionally renormalized 1pi functional as dened by eq. (41). the
brs symmetry breaking term breaking is given up to order hn by the following limit

breaking = limd4n dreg+ctdreg+z ddx x n(cid:2) s(n)

k(x)

ct

(x) oo. (43)

the fact [18] that if the anomaly cancellation conditions are met [23] the cohomology
of the linearized brs operator b in eq. (29) is trivial on the space of local polynomials of
ghost number one, guarantees that s(n)
fct can be chosen so that breaking above vanishes
whatever the value of n. hence, if the brs symmetry is non-anomalous, non-symmetric
counterterms can be added to the dimensional regularization classical action so that
the resulting renormalized action is brs invariant: s(ren) = 0. in this paper we shall
compute s(1)

fct explicitly (see subsection 3.6.).

let us close this subsection and express in terms of local operators in four dimensions
breaking, to the symmetry breaking term given in eq. (43).

the order h contribution, (1)
adapting eqs. (21) and (23) to the regularized theory at hand we conclude that

(45)

now, bd lg = bd la = bd l = bd lg = bd l() = 0, and therefore the only non-
0sing comes from the third line of eq. (39), which in turns is

vanisning bd-variation of (1)
equal to eq. (45). the fact that s(1)

sct = (1)

0 sing concludes the proof.

the next task to face is the computation of the order h contribution to the anomalous
insertion n[ ]  ren. we shall carry out this calculation in the next section. the computa-
tion is somewhat simplyed if we bare in mind that the eld b, enforcing the gauge-xing
condition, has no dynamics (no interaction vertices) unless forcibly introduced by appro-
priate choice of s(n)
fct (nite countertems). hence, it will be very advisable to imposse that
the nite counterms be independent of b, so that the only contribution to dreg involving
b is order h0 and given by s0 in eq. (32). it is thus plain that the so-called gauge-xing
equation

b(ren) 

 a   b = 0 ,

(46)

ren
b

holds for the renormalized theory. notice that eq. (46) does not clash with restoring the
brs symmetry since breaking dened in eq. (43) does not depend on b. of course, eq. (46)
is the equation of motion of b.

finally, the ghost equation is another interesting equation. it is just the equation of

motion of :

g ren (cid:26) 

 

+ 



(cid:27) ren = 0,

(47)

and is a consequence of eq. (42) and the gauge-xing equation. some functional dier-
entiation and the fact that breaking does not depend on b lead to eq. (47). a furher
simplication, the ghost equation implies that the functional which satisfy it depends on
 and  through the combination  =  +  . finally, it is not dicult to come to
the conclusion that this very simplication applies to each term on the right hand side of
eq. (43) and s(n)
ct

3.5. expansion of the anomalous insertion

the anomalous insertion n[ ]  ren has ghost number +1 and it is the insertion
into the 1pi functional ren of an evanescent integrated polynomial operator of ultraviolet
dimension 4 with neither free lorentz indices nor free indices for the gauge group. this
anomalous insertion is a functional of , , a,  (only through ), , but not of b, and

29

also of the external elds l, l, r, r,  (only through ) and . it is thus compulsory to
generalize rst eq. (25) so that it includes also feynman diagrams with the external elds
as vertices.

due to the explicit power-counting in our model, only diagrams with either no or one
external elds can be divergent. consider a diagram with the vertex ks ( denotes
any eld which undergoes non-linear brs transformations). the feynman rule in momen-
tum space of this vertex is an integration over a momentum q, which is absorbed in the
denition of the fourier transform of the function with an insertion of an operator, and
k(q) times the feynman rule of the operator insertion s at momentum
the factors i
h
q. the singular part is also a polynomial in q, therefore it can be expanded, together
with the rest of momenta, in a nite taylor series in q. a factor q1    qs together with
k(q) will lead to a (i)s 1    s k(x) which multiply the insertion of the monomial
operator obtained with the rest of momenta. therefore the bonneau identities (eq. (25))
are generalized to:

where j  {j1,    , jn} and the indexes jk, k = 1,    , n label the dierent types of
quantum elds, with the proviso that elds having dierent values of gauge group indices
are taken as dierent. the symbols (j), (j; ) denote, respectively, the overall degrees
k=0 and
k=0. notice that since our propagators
are massless the only non-vanishing contributions to the left hand side of eq. (48) come

the previous formula gives rise to an expansion of n[ ](x)  ren in terms of both
standard and evanescent monomials [6,7] (see section 2.4.). if we denote the monomials
generically by the letter m, the expansion will have the form

with each coecient being a formal series in h (starting at order h1). the latin letters
abc stand for the gauge group indices. we shall assume that repeated gauge group indices
are summed over. the monomials in eq. (49) have no free lorentz index. the objects
{ mabc...

carried out with g . notice that there is a one-to-one correspondence between {mabc...

notice that it is possible to construct other monomials with ghost number +1 and
(b)c,  abcd. the formulae for their coecients in
dimension 4: a
the bonneau expansion are also easily obtained, but we do not write them because in the
one loop computation all this coecients turn out to be zero. this is clear because all the
1pi functions we would have to compute involve at least two loops.
 anomalous monomials, i.e. with some g

take all the monomials written above and write all monomials obtained by adding
hats to the lorentz indices in all possible ways. no hatted index should appear contracted
with the , because this contraction vanish. notice that with the fermionic vertices

it is convenient to use the expansion in terms of barred and hatted monomials (so the

notice that the gauge group structure of the rst ve diagrams in g. 10 involves three
or more gauge group generator matrices. the gauge group structure of each diagram is
rather involved but it turns out that the r.s.p. of each of the rst three diagrams vanishes,
that the r.s.p. of the fourth cancels exactly against the th, and, thanks to the jacobi
identity, that the result of the last four diagrams combine in pairs to give eq. (58), where
the gauge group structure is simply a commutator.this is remarkable, because we shall see
in appendix c that the dierence between the one-loop 1pi fermionic vertex computed

that the nite counterterm that is needed to restore at the one-loop level the brs symmetry

b, of this counterterm yields a contribution linear in ab
 which will match the gauge group

result.

these coecients are very important, because if they are non-zero, give monomials in

of course, we write o(h2) because we have computed at rst order in h; but due to
the adler-bardeem theorem for non-abelian gauge theories [18], all these coecient should
be zero at higher orders if there would not be an anomaly at rst order.

remember that in the formulae for the coecients, a sum over the dierent left or right

that the coecients of the essential anomaly above vanish.

finally, as explained at the end of section 2.4., the coecients ki of the true expansion

notice that if the classical theory were cp invariant, the combination of monomials
obtained have the same cp denite value as the breaking, as we would have expected from
the fact that dimensional regularization respects discrete symmetries. but we have not
assumed any discrete symmetry property when writing the basis of bonneau monomials
because we work with general representations.

the result in eq. (64) can be obtained by computing the left hand side of eq. (64)
to the one-loop order, i.e. calculating the renormalized part of all possible one-loop 1pi
diagrams with the insertion ; their nite part has to be a local term, because when
going to the 4-dimensional space all (d  4)-objects are set to be 0, so the only remaining
nite part of such a diagram must come from a polynomial singular part formed by a
4-dimensional object and a contracted (d  4)-object which cancel the singularity in d  4.
therefore, being local this one-loop renormalized 1pi functions, there are operators (in
the 4-dimensional space) whose feynman rules attached with a h1 give the same result.
the sum of this operators is precisely the right hand side of eq. (64).

in fact, the one-loop calculation of the coecients of the bonneau identities via r.s.p. of
diagrams with the insertion of  are exactly the same as the nite part of diagrams with
the insertion of , excepting some factors in the bonneau coecients which directly give
the operators whose feynman rules lead to the same result.

41

but the bonneau identities unravel the problem in higher order computations, and the
formulae of the coecients given above would be the same (although with new feynman
rules coming from the nite counterterms we would have added in the previous recursive
step).

3.6. restoring the brs symmetry: the computation of s(1)
fct

we know from algebraic renormalization theory and brs cohomology [18] that there
exists an integrated local functional of the elds and their derivatives, let us call it x (1),

the form

such that the anomalous contribution hn[ ]  reni(1)
hn[ ]  reni(1)

3z d4x  trlr(cid:2) (aa 

(4)2

=

2

i
2

aaa)(cid:3) h1 + bx (1).

, given in eq. (64), can be cast into

the integrated local functional, x (1), has ghost number zero and ultraviolet dimension 4.
hence, by choosing s(1)

fct in eq. (35) so that it veries

s(1)
fct = x (1),

and recalling that eqs. (44) and (42) hold, we conclude that the brs identity is broken at
order h by the essential non-abelian gauge anomaly only:

s(ren) =

1

(4)2

2

3z d4x  trlr(cid:2) (aa 

i
2

aaa)(cid:3) h1 + o(h2).

the previous equation leads in turn to the result we sought for; namely, that if the
fermion representations meet the anomaly cancellation criterion [23], the brs symmetry
can be restored (up to order h) by an appropriate choice of nite counterterms s(1)
fct .
fct = x (1). we shall demand that s(1)

our next task will be to compute s(1)

fct do not

depend neither on b nor . recall that these elds do not occur in eq. (64).

the more general approach to this computation, similar to our study of the expan-

sion of hn[ ]  reni(1)

, would be: 1. write the complete list of possible monomials of
ultraviolet dimension 4, ghost number 0 and with no free lorentz indices ; 2. write the
general expression of the nite counterterms as a linear combination of those monomials
with coecients depending on gauge group indices. 3. take their b-variation and nally

4. impose that this variation cancels the expansion of the breaking term hn[ ]  reni(1)

,

 this list is a list in the four dimensional space-time. of course, some generalization
of them to the d-dimensional space-time of dimensional regularization has to be chosen
while writing them in the dimensional regularization action; but the dierences, being
(d  4)-objects, will begin to produce any eect at the following order in h (because they
require loops to yield a non-zero contribution and there is already an explicit h in s(1)
fct )

42

excepting the essential non-abelian anomaly. this should lead to a compatible indetermi-
nate system with the coecients as variables and with a degree of indeterminacy exactly
equal to the number of b-invariant operators in the classical theory.

but, writing such list and taking its b variation is a tedious task: lots of indices would

come in and the resolution of the nal system would appear a bit messy.

it is plain that the gauge group structure of the nite counterterms which would be
needed in the one-loop computation to restore the brs symmetry is not arbitrary. a
natural ansatz for the gauge group structure of these counterterms is to take the one-
loop gauge group structure which can appear while computing the feynman diagrams.
therefore, we write

s(1)

fct =a1 z (a)2 + a2 z a a + c z icabc(aa

notice that because of the reason given above we have not written terms with  or .

moreover, we have the combinations of terms given in eq. (30) which are b-invariant.
obviously, these combinations are not relevant to our computation. therefore, we can
reduce the basis of possible nite counterterms to a minimum number taking into account
these invariant counterterms.

la and l contain , which we supposed already not to appear in the nite coun-
terterms, so these invariant terms can not be used to reduce more the number of nite
counterterms. but, using lg we can impose e = 0 and by taking advantange of l() we
can set pl(r) = 0, without loss of generality.

then, there should be a unique solution for the problem of cancellation of spurious
anomalies in terms of the rest of variables a1, a2, c, dl(r), fl(r), nl(r), u1l(r) and u2l(r).

we recast eq. (66) in the following form:

s(1)
fct =a1 1 + a2 2 + c 3 + dl 4l + dr 4r + fl 5l + fr 5r

+ nl 6l + nr 6r + u1l 7l + u1r 7r + u2l 8l + u2r 8r.

(67)

we need the b variations of the s expanded in terms of the integrated monomials
we called ms. moreover, the coecients of these expansions should be symmetrized if
the gauge group indices of the corresponding monomials have some symmetry properties.

izations to the d-dimensional space-time of dimensional regularization of the correspond-
ing b-invariant four-dimensional operators. we have written s(1)
in the d-dimensional
fct
space of dimensional regularization so that diagrammatic computation can be readily
done.

notice that no terms in  or  are added, excepting the combination  in the invariant

counterterms; therefore the ghost equation holds up to order h.

notice also that, because of nite counterterms depending of the external elds l, l,

r and r have been added, we have now, e.g. (set l(1)

 = 0),

6= n[s](x)  ren

= n[s](x)  ren + h1 u(1)

1l s(x) + o(h2) = n[s + h1 u(1)

1l s](x)  ren + o(h2),

which can be interpreted as a non-minimal renormalization of the operator insertion (we
always apply minimal subtraction to the regularized diagrams, but the action have explicit
higher order nite counterterms). moreover, with l(1)
 6= 0, the insertion of the
non-linear brs-variations of the elds can be renormalized in dierent ways, all of them
compatible with the brs identities (i.e. there are several renormalization conditions for
that insertions compatible with the identities).

a 6= 0 or l(1)

of course, the nite counterterms given in eq. (69), are strongly dependent on the
choice for the o(h0) action, s0 (the dimensional regularization classical action in eq. (35)).
if we would have chosen the other mentioned fermionic vertex, the counterterms would have
certainly been completely dierent (and more complicated). but anyway the procedure
would have been equally correct.

notice that if the classical original theory is cp invariant the nite counterterms of
eq. (69) are also cp invariant. this was expected, due to the comments in the second
paragraph below eq. (34).

3.7. the renormalization group equation

it is plain that the standard textbook techniques usually employed to derive the
renormalization group equation for dimensionally renormalized vector theories like q.e.d
and q.c.d are of no use here. the formalism of bare elds, bare coupling constants
and multiplicative renormalization of the classical action breaks down as shows eq. (37).
the generalization of this formalism to include evanescent operators, and the correspond-
ing renormalized coupling constants, becomes a bit awkward when the regularized theory
does not posses the symmetries that should hold in the quantum eld theory. indeed a
host of bare evanescent non-symmetric operators, each bringing in a new renormalized
coupling constant, may enter the game. this is in addition to the nite non-evanescent
non-symmetric counterterms needed to restore the symmetry broken in the dimensional
renormalization process. these nite counterterms should also come from bare operators.
hence, the construction of an appropriate bare action and the derivation of the true (i.e.
only involving as many coupling constants and anomalous dimensions as there are classical
couplings and elds) renormalization group equation is a rather involved task (for related
information see ref. [32]). we shall abandon this quest altogether. indeed, thanks to the
quantum action principle, bonneau identities and the formalism of algebraic renormal-
ization there is no need to introduce bare elds and bare couplings to derive the true
renormalization group equation. we only need the renormalized 1pi functional, ren,
which is symmetric up to the order in h demanded, obtained by the method explained in
this paper.

let ren[, , k; g, , ] be the dimensionally renormalized up to order hn 1pi func-
tional of our theory, which we will take to be anomaly free all along the current subsection.
ren depends explicitly on the elds, collectively denoted by  and , the external elds,
collectively denoted by k, the coupling constant g, the gauge xing parameter  and the
dimensional regularization scale , which is introduced along the lines laid in v) of sub-
section 2.2. we shall assume that nite countertems, s(n)
fct (see eq. (35)), has been chosen
so that the brs equation s(ren) = 0, the gauge-xing condition b(ren) = 0 (eq. (46)),
and the ghost equation g ren = 0 (eq. (47)) hold up to order hn.

the renormalization group equation of the theory gives the expasion of the functional
 ren
in terms of a certain basis of quantum insertions of ultraviolet dimension 4 and

ghost number 0 [7,18]. the coecients of this expansion, which are formal power series
in h, are the beta functions and anomalous dimensions of the theory. since ren satises,
up to order hn, the equations mentioned in the previous paragraph, the elements of basis
of insertions we are seeking is not only constrained by power-counting and ghost number.
indeed, the following three equations hold up to order hn:

the functionals with ultraviolet dimension 4 and ghost number 0 which satisfy up to
order hn the set of equations in eq. (70) form a linear space. let us construct a basis of
this space. in the classical approximation (i.e. at order h0), a basis of this space is given
[18] by the b  sscl-invariant terms lg, lr
, la and l, dened as follows:

(71)

where the scl  terms are the corresponding b-independent terms of the classical action
scl given in eq. (27). the symmetric dierential operators [18] n r

we shall work out now a basis (up to order hn, of course) of the space of joint solutions
of eqs. (70) with the help of the statement made in the second paragraph of subsection 2.4.
(see ref. [18] for further details). up to order hn, a quantum extension of the classical basis

in eq. (71) is furnished [18] by the action on ren of the symmetric dierential operators
dened above along with symmetric dierential operator gg. indeed, the functionals

with the brs equation, the gauge-xing condition and the ghost equation, in the sense we
spell out next.

, n l

let f be the linear space of functionals with ultraviolet dimension 4 and ghost number
0 which satisfy (up to order hn) the brs equation, the gauge-xing condition and the ghost
equation: s() = 0, b() = 0, g() = 0,   f . an operator d acting on f is said to
be compatible with the brs equation, the gauge-xing condition and the ghost equation
if, by denition, the following set of equations hold:

s(d) = 0,


b

(d) = 0,

g(d) = 0.

in summary, up to order hn, any joint solution of eqs. (70) is a linear combination

with h-dependent coecients of the following functionals:

in particular, if  is the arbitrary scale introduced by hand for each loop integration

this equation holds up to order hn and it is the renormalization group equation of our
theory. notice that the expansion  ren
 in terms of the basis in eq. (73) is only possible
if the renormalized functional satises order by order the brs identity (hence, there is
anomaly cancellation, in particular) and the gauge-xing condition.
it is important to
notice that the regularized 1pi functional does not generally satisfy an equation such as
eq. (74).

let us notice that the coecients of the expansions of  ren


in the quantum basis
of insertions in eq. (73) are the beta functions and anomalous dimensions of the theory.
these coecients are to be understood as formal expansions in h. the rst non-trivial
contribution to these expansions is always of order h, since the lowest order contribution
to ren is the classical action, scl, and  scl

we next proceed to the computation of the beta function and anomalous dimensions
and nren, where

of our theory. this is done [6] by expressing rst  ren

n denotes any of the dierential operators in eq. (72), as insertions in ren of linearly
independent local normal products of the elds and their derivatives; then, these insertions
are substituted into the left hand side of the renormalization group equation (eq. (74)) and,
nally, one solves for , l
, a and , the set of equations involving only
numbers which results from the linear independence of the aforementioned local normal
products.

that g ren

g and nren, where n denotes any of the dierential operators in eq. (72),
can be expressed as insertions in ren of normal products is a mere consequence of the
quantum action principle: qap1 and qap3, given by eqs. (14) and (16), lead to

and

(s0 + s(n)
fct )

]  ren,

n ren = n[(n (s0 + s(n)

fct ))]  ren,

(75)

(76)

respectively. hence, every element of the symmetric quantum basis in eq. (73) is a local
combination of quantum insertions of integrated standard (i.e. non-evanescent) monomials
with ultraviolet dimension 4 and ghost number 0 (see subsection 2.4.). it should not be
overlooked the fact s0 + s(n)
in eqs. (75) and (76) is the non-singular contribution to the
fct
dimensional regularization action, s(n)
dreg (see subsection 3.2.), employed to obtain the
minimal dimensionally renormalized 1pi functional up to order hn, ren, by following the
algorithm spell out in subsection 2.2. the formal functional s0 +s(n)
fct is therefore an object
in the d-dimensional space-time of dimensional regularization. if n > 2, it would not do
to use some other functional, s, such that (s0 +s(n)
fct )s = s is an integrated evanescent
operator whose h-expansion has contributions of order hm, with m  n2. recall that the
contribution o(h(n1)) in s is not be relevant here since, being an evanescent object, the
lowest order contribution coming from its insertion in ren is o(hn) and local, so that it
does not contribute to the renormalization group equation at order hn; a similar argument
holds for the term of order hn in s.

now, by substituting eqs. (75) and (76) in eq. (74) one obtains the following equation



ren


=  g n[

(s0 + s(n)
fct )

g

]  ren +x

 n[(n (s0 + s(n)

fct ))]  ren,

(77)

where  labels the symmetric dierential operators in eq. (72). hence, to compute the
beta functions and anomalous dimensions of the theory we only need an independent way
of computing  ren
 in terms of the insertions on the right hand side of eq. (77). we shall
set up this independent way of computation next.

unlike for the subtraction algorithm employed in ref. [3], in minimal dimensional
renormalization, one can not use (see ref. [6]) the quantum action principle to obtain an
equation for  ren
 analogous to eqs. (75), (76). indeed, in minimal dimensional renormal-
ization,  is not a parameter of the action (s0 +s(n)
fct ), but a parameter which is introduced

50

by hand in each loop-momentum integration (as a factor 4d) before computing the renor-
malized value of the corresponding feynman diagram.

the problem of expressing  ren


as an insertion in ren of a linear combination
normal product operators was also solved by bonneau [6] in the framework of rigorous
minimal dimensional renormalization. he obtain a formula similar to eq. (25), i.e. a
zimmerman-like identity, for a scalar case with no added nite counterterms in the action.
here we need the generalization to the presence of several type of elds, including external
elds, the presence of hatted objects and also the presence of nite counterterms up to
order hn, in the action (s0 + s(n)

fct ). the needed generalization reads

where j = {j1,    , jn}, and, (j) and (j; ) stand, respectively, for the overall ultravio-
k=0.
the bar upon the 1pi green functions means that all subdivergences has been subtracted
from the feynman diagrams which contribute to them. this is as in eq. (48). the novel
feature here is the presence of the superscript nl on the upper right of the green function,
which indicates that only feynman diagrams with precisely nl loops are to be consid-
ered. notice that one then sums over all number loops upon multiplication by nl of the
nl-contribution.

k=0 and(cid:10) j1 (p1)  jn(pn)n[s](pn+1)(cid:11)1pi

the r.s.p. of the subtracted (subdivergences only) 1pi feynman diagrams contributing
to the right hand side of eq. (78) is a local polynomial in the d-dimensional space of dimen-
sional regularization of external momenta associated with the elds of the corresponding
1pi function; so, in general, it will contain hatted and barred objects (metrics, momenta,
gamma matrices). therefore, the formula will generate automatically also evanescent (also
called anomalous) insertions. the meaning of  in last formula is the same as in eq. (25).

51

hence, the expansion in eq. (78) can be recast into the form



ren


=xi

ri n[ wi]  ren +xj

rj n[ wj]  ren

(79)

where wi and wj denote, respectively, the barred (non-evanescent) and hatted (evanes-
cent) elements of a basis of integrated monomials with ghost number 0 and ultraviolet
dimension 4. the symbols ri and rj in eq. (79) are coecients dened as formal expan-
sions in h (starting at h, since their computation involves that of the r.s.p. of the divergent
part of the appropriate 1pi function). the order hm, 0 < m  n, contribution to these
coecients is obtained as follows:

 take a divergent, by power-counting, 1pi function with some number of elds of

denite type ( maybe including some external eld coupled to a brs variation).

 compute the residue of the simple pole (r.s.p. ) of every o(hm)-graph constructed
fct ) and contributing to that 1pi

with the feynman rules derived from the action (s0 + s(n)
function, with all their subdivergences subtracted.

 multiply the last quantity by the number of the loops of the graph
 sum over all graphs contributing to the 1pi function
 being the sum a local expression, their dierent terms can be interpreted as feynman
rules of tree-level integrated insertions of lorentz invariant (normal or anomalous) com-
posite operators, formed by just the elds of the original 1pi function and some dierent
combination of metrics, derivatives and gamma matrices.

 do the same steps for every divergent 1pi function. then you will obtain the

expansion eq. (79) with the o(hm) coecients.

explicit expressions for each ri and rj similar to that ones for the expansion of the

anomalous breaking can be given. for example, if

next, by using the bonneau identities technique we shall express (see subsection 2.4.)
every evanescent insertion n[ wj]  ren on the right hand side of eq. (79) as a linear
combination of standard (i.e. non-evanescent) insertions n[ wi]  ren:

n[ wj]  ren =xi

cji n[ wi]  ren.

(80)

the coecients cji are formal expasions in powers of h, having no order h0 contribution.
the use of the previous equation turns eq. (79) into the following equation:



ren


=xi

ri n[ wi]  ren,

(81)

where ri = ri +pj rj cji, so that ri = ri at order h. notice that, because the evanescent

insertions are to be expanded according to the bonneau identities in eq. (25), the compu-
tation of ri up to order hn only involves the contributions to rj up to order h(n1), whereas
the contributions to ri are needed up to order hn.
fct ], g

g [ s0 + s(n)

now, since g

fct )] and n [(s0 
s0) + (s(n)
fct )] are linear combinations of monomials of ultraviolet dimension 4 and
ghost number 0, it is advisable to choose the basis of monomials { wi, wj}, which occurs
in eq. (79), in such a way that it contains the former set of monomials. in other words,
the basis { wi, wj} so chosen makes it possible to obtain the coecients on the right hand
side of the following equations

g [(s0  s0)+(s(n)

fct  s(n)

g

g





fct(cid:3) =xi
g(cid:2) s0 + s(n)

fct )(cid:3) =xj
fct )(cid:3) =xj

fct(cid:3) =xi

wi wi

fct  s(n)

wgj wj ,

fct  s(n)

wj wj ,

by reading them from the left hand side of the corresponding equation. the coecients
wgi, wgi, wi and wi have expansions in powers of h; these expansions, though, have now
contributions of order h0.

it is a trivial exercise to check that eq. (77) can be recast into the form



ren


=xi (cid:0)   wgi +x

 wi(cid:1) n[ wi]  ren +xj

( wgi +x

 wi(cid:1) n[ wj]  ren

the substitution of eq. (80) into the last equation gives the following result



ren


=xi (cid:0)   wgi +x

 wi(cid:1) n[ wi]  ren,

(82)

53

where

wgi = wgi +xj

wgj cji

and wi = wi +xj

wj cji,

where the index j labels the elements of the evanescent basis { wj}.

finally, by comparing eqs. (81) and (82), one obtains an overdeterminate system of

linear equations whose unknowns are the coecients  and :

ri =  wgi +x

 wi,

(83)

where the index i runs over the elements of the standard (i.e. with no evanescent operator)
basis { wi}.

several remarks about eq. (78) are now in order.
 this equation is only correct if the nite counterterms in s(n)

fct are independent
of . this poses no problem, because the nite counterterms we need to add to the
action to restore the brs identities do not depend on , thanks to the fact that in the
bonneau identities we have to compute only r.s.p.s of 1pi functions with all subdivergences
minimally subtracted and these r.s.p. are always mass and  independent.

 the counterpart of eq. (78) in ref. [6] replaces the factor nl, which counts the
h . this is because, if no terms of order hm, m > 0
number of loops, with the operator h 
are present in the action, then the powers in h of a graph counts its number of loops. but
now we have added higher order terms in h to the action and so we cannot use h as a loop
meter. this can be superseded by introducing a new parameter l, which divides the whole
action, including the nite counterterms. then lnl1 would be the factor attached to a nl-
loop feynman diagram. note that only in the limit l  1 the nite counterterms restore

l(cid:9).
the brs identities. therefore, the factor nl in eq. (78) is replaced by liml1 (cid:8)1 + l 
thanks to the action principles, the action of the operator liml1 (cid:8)1 + l 
l(cid:9) on a 1pi

green function computed for arbitrary l can be replaced with the insertion of the integrated
operator 1  n[i(s0 + s(n)
fct )] into that 1pi function at l = 1. it should be stressed that this
is true only if there is no explicit -dependence in the nite counterterms.

let us move on and compute the beta function and anomalous dimensions of our

theory at order h. at h-order, eq. (83) reads

i = (1) w (0)
r(1)

gi +x

 w (0)
(1)
i ,

(84)

i + o(h). to obtain {r(1)

i h + o(h2),  = (1)h + o(h2), wgi = w (0)

for ri = r(1)
 h + o(h2)
and wi = w (0)
i }, we just need a suitable basis of integrated
barred monomials { wi} with ultraviolet dimension 4 and ghost number 0: the evanescent
monomials { wj} are not needed at this order in h. the basis { wi} is furnished by the
following list of monomials with ghost number 0, dimension 4, free gauge indices and fully
contracted lorentz indices:

which is a simplied version of eq. (84). this simplication takes place since the non-
symmetrical nite counterterms, s(n)
fct , needed to restore the brs symmetry and the evanes-
cent monomials, wj, only begin to contribute to the renormalization group equation at
order h2. at order hn, n > 1, it is the linear system in eq. (83) which is to be dealt with.
the system in eq. (89) is compatible and overdeterminate and its solution reads:

the reader should notice that to actually compute the beta function and anomalous
dimensions of the theory one does not need to evalute the thirtyone coecients in eq. (85)
(computed in eq. (86)) but just a few of them, if appropriately chosen. indeed, the com-
putation of, say, r(1) ab
would do the job. however, a
thorough check of the formalism demands the computation of the thirtyone coecients in
question. and this we have done.

we have nished the computation of the renormalization group equation at order h
for the theory with classical action in eq. (27). our expasions were expasions in h, as suits
the cohomology problems which arise in connection with the brs symmetry, rather that in
the coupling constant g. our parametrizations of the wave functions were such that g only
occurs, in the classical action, in the yang-mills term, so that ggscl is the only element
(modulo multiplication by a constant) of the local cohomology of the brs operator b (see
eq. (29)) over the space of local integrated functionals of ghost number 0 and ultraviolet
dimension 4 (lorentz invariance and rigid gauge symmetry are also assumed). the other
contributions to the renormalization group equation are b-exact and have to do with the
anomalous dimensions of the theory.

it is often the case that one choses a parametrization of the wave function such that,
at the tree-level, the fermionic and the three-boson vertices carry the coupling factor g,
and the four-boson vertex is proportional to g2. the renormalization group equation
for this parametrization of the wave function is easily retrieved from our results. let
ren[a, , , b, ,  , , , , , , g] the 1pi functional for this new
us denote by 
parametrization. then,

ren[a, , , b, ,  , , , , , , g] 

ren[ga, g, g1 g1, g1b, g1, g1 , , , , , g2, g] 
ren[a, , , b, , , , , , , , g],

where ren[a, , , b, , , , , , , , g] is the 1pi functional for the parametrization of
eq. (27). now, since

4. chiral yang-mills theories: non-simple gauge groups

4.1. the tree level action

in this section, the gauge group will be a compact lie group which is the direct product
of ns simple groups and na abelian factors. its (real) lie algebra is a direct sum: g =
g1      gna gna+1      gna+ns of dimension dg = na+ dgna+1 +    + dgna+ns
.
the index g, which labels the group factors, will run from 1 to na + ns , the index a,
which labels the abelian factors, from 1 to na and the index s, which labels the simple
factors, from 1 to ns .

therefore, there exists a basis for the lie algebra which can be split and enumerated

as follows:

(cid:8)xa(cid:9)dg

a=1 =(cid:8)x1, . . . , xna, xna+1, . . . , xna+dg1

s=1 {x (s)
as }

 { x1, . . . , xna}[(cid:0) ns

dgna s

, . . .(cid:9)
as =1 (cid:1);

and such that the killing form of the semisimple part is diagonal and positive denite; so,
we choose b
a to lower and rise indices. for any such basis, the structure constants, given
c xc, are completely antisymmetric, and cagde cbg de = 0 if g 6= g,
by [xa, xb] = i cab
cagde cbgde = cagdgeg cbgdgeg = c(g)

a  0 (clearly, caabc = 0).

a ab, with c(a)

let us display the eld content of the theory and introduce the dimensional regular-
ization classical action, s0. we have rst the lie-algebra-valued elds. the pure yang-
mills part of the tree-level action in the d-dimensional space of dimensional regularization
reads:

f a
 cabf b 

(91)

sym =z ddx

k2 (cid:1) + c 

kk

k2 i(cid:19)ab

;

i.e. diagonal but no longer multiple of the identity.

notice that we have also introduced ghosts to control the abelian variations. since
ghosts in abelian theories do not interact with the rest of elds (a = a), they can
occur in a non-tree-level 1pi diagram only as a part of a vertex insertion (brs-variations
and breakings); so that, by dierenciating with respect to a the slavnov-taylor identities,
the usual abelian ward identities are easily recovered. but we insist on keeping the abelian
ghost in order to have an unied notation.

the matter content of the theory will be only non-majorana fermions. the corre-
sponding fermion elds, (), carrying a left-handed (right-handed) fully reducible rep-
resentation of the gauge group, so that it can be descomposed in a sum of irreducible
representations. from now on, until otherwise stated, we will take both the left-handed
and right-handed fermionic to be irreducible, the general case just involve a sum over all
the irreducible representations.

we shall index the fermion elds carrying the irreducible representation of the gauge
s); so that the

lie algebra as follows i1,...,ins ( i1,...,ins ), with is running from 1 to ds (d

also, our 1pi renormalized functional constructed from eq. (92) with breitenlohner
and maison mininal dimensional renormalization realizes this symmetry at one-loop level.
if the 1pi functional satises this new requirement, the set of admissible b-invariants
terms is obviously smaller. thanks to proposition 5.9 of ref. [18], the trivial subset formed
by terms which are b-exact and rigidly symmetric is fully determined by studying the
restricted cohomology, i.e. by studing the set of terms which are b-variations of rigidly
symmetric terms.

but, they will not be needed in renormalization group computations, because in min-

these terms come from the renormalization of the abelian components of the matrix

to a non- diagonal matrix in the abelian part while the right hand side of eq. (91) continue

6. conclusions

we have shown by performing explicit thorough one-loop computations that dimen-
sional regularization a la breitehloner and maison can be used blindly to carry out cal-
culations in chiral gauge theories. up to best of our knowledge it is the rst time that
such a complete one-loop study has been carried out. it shows that the renormalization
method at hand has all the properties that on general grounds were expected. notice that
here the cancellation of anomalies is not used to try to hide any inconsistency. even when
there is not cancellation of anomalies, the renormalized theory is nite and unambigous:
in particular, the brs anomaly is obtained without doing any tinkering. this is in stark
contrast to the naive approach, were cancellation of anomalies is invoked to dangerously
try to hide some incosistencies.

we would like to stress the fact that it would not have been feasible to carry out the
computations made in this paper without the help of the action principles and the brs
cohomolgy theory. this makes manifest the importance of these two theoretical tools in
practical computations in chiral gauge theories.

appendix a: slavnov-taylor identities

this appendix is devoted to establishing eq. (19) by using the regularized action

principle as stated in eqs. (11) and (12).

let s(n)

dreg be given by

sfree[, ] + sint[, ; k],

where

sfree[; ] = s0free[; ],

sint[, ; k; ] = s0int[, ] +z ddx k(x)sd(x) + s(n)

ct [, ; k].

the symbols  and  stand, respectively, for sets of elds which transforms linearly and
non-linearly under arbitrary brs transformations. the generalization to d-dimensions
of the brs transformations are denoted by sd(x) and sd(x). we dene sdk(x) = 0

we next dene

sint[, ; j, j, k] = sint[, ; k] +z ddx(cid:0)j(x)(x) + j(x)(x)(cid:1)

following eq. (10), the generating functional zdreg is introduced next

zdreg[j, j, k] =(cid:10)expn i

h

70

sint[, ; j, j, k]o(cid:11)0,

where the symbol h  i0 is dened as in the paragraph below eq. (10).

let  and ct de dened as follows:

 = sds0,

ct = sds(n)
ct ,

where s0 = s0free[; ] + s0int[, ] +r ddx k(x)sd(x).

we now introduce s()

int for reasons that will become clear later:

s()
int = sint[, ; j, j, k] + saux,

where

saux =z ddx(cid:0)1(x)(x) + 2(x)ct(x) + 

3 (x)

s(n)
ct

k(x)(cid:1),

and  = r ddx (x) and ct = r ddx ct(x). i, i = 1, 2 and 3 are external elds. we

dene sdi(x) to be zero for any exteranl eld i. then, we introduce the generating
functional z

dreg as follows

z

dreg[j, j, k, 1, 2, 

3 ] =(cid:10)expn i

h

s

int[, ; j, j, k, i]o(cid:11)0,

where h  i0 is dened as for zdreg.

it is obvious that the following equation holds in dimensional regularization:

zdreg[j, j, k] = z

dreg[j, j, k, 1 = 0, 2 = 0, 

3 = 0]

the regularized action principle (see eq. (11)) implies that the following equation holds
in dimensional regularization:

sdz

dreg z ddxd(cid:16)(x) + ct(x) + (1)j(x)s(x) + (1)j(x)s(x)
+ terms proportional to i(cid:17) expn i

int[, , j, j, k, ioe0

= 0.

where the functionals in the previous equations are to be understood as formal power series
in h and the elds (both external and quantum). by taking advantage of eq. (a.5) one
turns eq. (a.4) into an equation for the 1pi functional

appendix b. slavnov-taylor identities for -dependent brs

this appendix is devoted to the study of the contributions to the right hand side of
eq. (21) coming from brs variations which depend explicitly on  = 4  d. we shall see
that, unlike for the brs transformations in eq. (31), the variation under these new brs
transformations of the singular counterterms yield a nite contribution to the right hand
side of eq. (21).

to introduce an explicit  dependence on the dimensional regularization brs trans-
da =
d acts on the rest of the elds as

formations, we shall replace the brs transformation of a given in eq. (31) with s
 + c(d  4). we shall assume, however, that s
sd does. hence, s

d denes brs transformations with explicit  dependence.

although we have changed the dimensional reguarization brs transformations, we
shall not take a new dimensional regularization classical action, which still will be s0 in
eq. (32). thus, we will not modify the minimally renormalized 1pi functional minren, so
that we will have the eect of the new dimensional regularization brs transformations
isolated.

the s

d-variation of s0 is given by:

ds0 =  + 
s

f + 

gf + 
.

here,  = sds0 is the breaking given in eq. (34) and



r) ()a,

l  + t a

f =  c z ddx ( plt a

are the new breakings (which are also evanescent operators). notice that s

whereas sd

2 aa

 = 0.

2 aa

 6= 0,

now, let 0 denote dimensionally regularized 1pi functional obtained from s0, then,

regularized slavnov-taylor equation for the s

d-transformations reads:

where s

d is the slavnov-taylor operator for s

d. notice that

the next issue to address is the derivation of the (anomalous) slavnov-taylor identity sat-
ised by the minimal dimensional renormalization 1pi functional, minren. if we, naively,

73

just replace in eq. (b.1) every regularized object with their minimally renormalized coun-
terpart, we will obtain the following equation

s(minren) = nh  + 

f + 

gf + 

i  minren.

(b.2)

this equation does not hold, though, since the coecients of the regularized slavnov-
taylor equation, eq. (b.1), do have an explicit  dependence. indeed, at the one-loop level
the following identity holds

+ o(h2).

(b.3)

this has been shown in subsection 3.4. now, let us substitute the previous equation in

at the one-loop level. which is nonsense, for a diagramatic computation shows that

f + 

gf +

s(minren) =hnh i  minreni(1)

hence, a contribution to the right hand side of eq. (b.2) is missing. this missing contri-
bution should apparently be furnished by the second and third terms on the right hand
side of eq. (21), which is a consequence of eq. (a.7). but, it is essential to remember the
assumption made in appendix a in order to properly deduce eq. (a.7): the dependence in
d is the variation

k in the starting dimensional regularized action should ber k s

appendix c. comparison between naive and breitenlohner and maison

minimal dimensional renormalization schemes

in this appendix we shall make a thorough comparison of the minimally renormalized
one-loop 1pi functionals obtained within the naive dimensional renormalization pre-
scription, on the one hand, and the breitenlohner and maison dimensional regularization
scheme, on the other. the quantum eld theory under scrutiny will be the theory already
studied in section 3. obviously, at the one-loop level, dierences only arise in diagrams
involving fermions. we will denote these contributions with the subscript f . all along
this appendix, the subscripts bm and naive will indicate that the corresponding quan-
tity has been evaluated by using the breitenlohner and maison scheme and the naive
prescription, respectively.

let us begin with the self-energy of the gauge eld. here, only the fermionic loops
may give rise to dierences between the two calculational techniques. there are terms with
one 5 and four s in the trace, but their contribution explicitly vanish, the reason being
the contraction of two s of the antisymmetic trace with the same momentum q. the
naive prescription does not yield ambiguous the results in this instance. these results
read

notice that there is a singular contribution at  = 0 whose residue is a an evanescent
polynomial of the momentum. minimal subtraction has to be applied also to this contri-
bution; in the language of ultraviolet divergent counterterms: counterterms with hatted
objects are also needed! this is important for the consistency of calculations in the next
orders [32].

which diers from the naive result in a non-transversal quantity, so that it is clear that
this result do not satisfy the slavnov-taylor identity.

but, we learned from eq. (40) that the slavnov-taylor identities for the regularized

(because the insertion of the breaking is integrated, it is an insertion at zero momentum).

as it should be. indeed, eqs. (c.1) and (c.3) satisfy (o()) eq. (c.2). the contribution
from the sum of diagrams with bosonic and ghost loops is obviously transversal and thus
it is of no bearing here.

the rst term of the sum corresponds to the qed-like diagram and the second term to
the diagram with the three boson vertex.

let us move on to the computation of the most interesting one-loop 1pi functions to
compare, namely, the three and four point 1pi functions for the gauge eld. in both these
cases the naive prescription leads to ambiguities.

the fermionic diagrams which contribute to the one-loop three boson vertex are
shown in g. 13. the contribution from the diagram drawn there will be denoted with
il

abc (k1, k2, k3). the full contribution will thus read:

i(1)

tr [ (k/  k/1)k/(k/ + k/2) 5 ].

(c.4)

notice that when the integration over the ks is done a trace over six gammas, two of
them contracted, and a 5 occurs. this is precisely the source of the ambiguity displayed
by eq. (7) ! indeed, if we had decided to leave the matrix 5 in another place, the minimally
renormalized results should dier in a local quantity: there is a divergent loop present,
and the ambiguity of eq. (7) is proportional to  = 4  d. this is the reason why we have
labeled the numerator with the subscript 1.

therefore, we can write

il

abc (k1, k2, k3) + ir

abc (k1, k2, k3) =

t abc
r + t abc

t

vvv(k1, k2, k3) +

(c.5)

where tvvv stands for the abelian green function (i.e. without gauge group matrices)
and with three vector-like vertices and t
vva(k1, k2, k3) denotes the abelian diagram with
an axial vertex 5 in the leg carrying momentum k3.

the breitenlohner and maison counterpart to eq. (c.4) is (we have used eq. (26)) the

following

n 

abc bm =

t abc
r + t abc

l

r  t abc
t abc

l

2

tr [ (k/  k/1)k/(k/ + k/2) ] +

tr [ (k/  k/1)k/(k/ + k/2) 5 ].

it is easy to calculate the dierence between the renormalized result obtained with
the help of eq. (c.4) (do not move around the 5 matrix) and the renormalized result
obtained from eq. (c.5): the only contribution to this dierence comes from the renormal-
ization of the dimensionally regularized integral whose numerator is given by

r + t abc
t abc

l

r  t abc

(cid:8) tr [ k/k/(k/ + k/2) ] + tr [ k/k/ k/ ] + tr [ (k/  k/1)k/ k/ ](cid:9) +
(cid:8) tr [ k/k/(k/ + k/2) 5 ] + tr [ k/k/ k/ 5 ] +

tr [ (k/  k/1)k/ k/ 5 ](cid:9) .

the value of that dierence is thus the following

notice that the second term of the previous equation is not cyclic, i.e. if we make the
change (k1, , a)  (k2, , b), (k2, , b)  (k3, , c), (k3, , c)  (k1, , a) the term changes.
this seems to be incompatible with having a trace which is cyclic (or with the fact that
we can start to read a closed fermion loop wherever we want). of course, if a prescription
for feynman rules is consistent, the renormalized result should be also cyclic. this is the
case for the breitenlohner amd maison result, as can be checked explicitly. but in the
naive prescription case, if we insist on an anticommuting 5, the cyclicity of the trace is
to be abandoned, lest the trace of four gammas and one 5 vanishes. the lack of cyclicity
of eq. (c.6) is due, of course, to the inconsistency of the naive prescription with the
ciclicity of the trace.

one could insist on keeping an anticommuting 5 and cyclicity of the trace. but, then,
as we know from eq. (6), the trace of four gammas and a 5 should unavoidably vanish. this
would not do since it would set to zero any dimensionally regularized feynman integral
that is nite by power-counting at d = 4 and whose dirac algebra yields a contribution
proportional to the trace of four gammas and one 5.

the cyclicity of the diagram is also needed for obtaining a bose symmetric 1pi function
after summing the crossed diagram. taking into account this crossed diagram the dierence
between the complete 1pi functions in both schemes is:

if there is cancellation of anomalies. moreover, we
have compared the unambiguous breitenlohner and maison computation with the naive
result obtained by putting the 5 after the  (see eq. (c.4)). if we had put it after, say, the
, the new dierence with the result a la beitenlohner and maison has exactly the same
rst term as the dierence in eq. (c.7) but its second term is the second contribution in
the right hand side of eq. (c.7), upon having changed cyclically the indices and momenta
of the latter. that is, the one-loop dierence between two possible naive calculations
is a term involving a product of an epsilon tensor and the coecient dbca
rl =
d{abc}
rl . this justies the statement that if there is cancellation of anomalies there is no
ambiguity in the one-loop naive computation of the three boson vertex . in ref. [29], it
was correctly claimed that the one-loop essential anomaly could be also obtained with
the naive prescription for the abelian case from a vva triangle diagram by simply
not moving around the unique 5 which appear in the traces, computing explicitly the

rl = dabc

 {  } enclosing indices means symmetrization and [  ] antisymmetrization

dimensional integrals and contracting, at the end of the day, the nal expression with the
momentum in the axial vertex. in fact, with our notation

k
3 t

vva(k1, k2, k3) = 

i

(4)2 tr[k/1k/25],

(c.8)

which, with the crossed diagram, gives correctly the abelian chiral anomaly. of course,
also is checked explicitly that

k
1 t

vva(k1, k2, k3) = k

2 t

vva(k1, k2, k3) = 0.

it is widely known that a zero (so, incorrect) result can be obtained by performing
shifts in the integration variables and using the cyclicity of the trace and the anticommu-
tativity of 5. therefore, the correctness of the results above seems to be due to the fact
that in the explicit calculations no use of the anticommutativity of 5 have been made.
unfortunately, for this restricted -the 5 is not moved around- naive prescription action
principles cannot be usefully applied (the action is not invariant if the 5 is not anticom-
muted) and, more importantly, in local gauge chiral theories, such as the model studied
here, triangle diagrams vaa and aaa also appear. if one decides not to anticommute
the 5s before the subtraction is made, one cannot tell before hand whether the result
will satisfy the slavnov-taylor identities with the correct essential breaking, unless explicit
check is made order by order. and if one naively anticommutes the 5s, then one will
obtain ambiguous results (which turns out to be safe in one-loop calculations if there is
cancellation of anomalies, but it is not clear at all what happens at higher orders)

of course, the breitenlohner and maison scheme is a consistent method and has none

of these problems. from eq. (42) we get the explicit identity which involves r (1)
aaa:

 i(k + p) r (1)

could think of applying eq. (c.8) to obtain an anomaly

is dierent from the correct breitenlohner and maison result. moreover, eq. (c.10) was
obtained by putting the one 5 that is left after the anticommutation process is done in
the position . if we had put it in the position , we would not have obtained any anomaly
at all. (the anomaly obtained with the rst choice for a place for the 5 is three times
the correct breitenlohner and maison result and three is the number of choices). this
shows clearly that the naive prescription cannot give consistently the one-loop anomaly
in chiral local gauge theories. therefore, the claim that we do not need discuss the graphs
containing the aaa triangle since these behave in the same manner as the avv triangle
of [30] seems to be not well justied.

procedure, on the other, are equivalent at the one-loop level, in the sense that they are
related by nite brs symmetric renormalizations of the elds and couplings of the theory.
as we have previously compared the breitenlohner and maison renormalized theory
with the naive renormalized theory when no nite brs-asymmetric counterterms have
been added to the former to restore the brs symmetry, the comparison between the two
renormalized theories, when the brs-asymmetric counterterms have been added to the
minimal breitelhoner and masion renormalized theory, is very easy.

due to the fact that, in the situation of cancellation of anomalies, the naive min-
imal dimensionally renormalized theory satisfy the slavnov-taylor identities at order h1,
the nite counterterms relating the two renormalized theories should appear in b-invariant
combinations. and this is what nicely happen, upon inclusion of nite brs asymmet-
ric counterterms, the breitenlohner and maison renormalized theory equals the naive
renormalized theory if the coecients -l(1)
 , l(1)
 - of the brs-symmetric
counterterms in eq. (69) are chosen to be given by

this corresponds, of course, to a mass-independent multiplicative nite renormalization of
the elds and parameters of the eective action. hence, the beta function and anomalous
dimensions of both renormalized theories are the same at the one-loop level. the nite
renormalizations we have just mentioned read

where the elds and constants with a star are the renormalized elds and constants
in the naive minimal dimensional regularization prescrition and the elds and constant
without stars stand for the corresponding renormalized quantities in renormalized theory
obtained by means of the breitenlohner and maison scheme (minimal subtraction plus
addition of the nite counterterms in eq. (69), with l(1)
 set to zero).
