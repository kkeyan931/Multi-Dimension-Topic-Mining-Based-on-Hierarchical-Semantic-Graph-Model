we give an explicit demonstration that the derivative expansion of the qed eective action is a
divergent but borel summable asymptotic series, for a particular inhomogeneous background mag-
netic eld. a duality transformation b  ie gives a non-borel-summable perturbative series for a
time dependent background electric eld, and borel dispersion relations yield the non-perturbative
imaginary part of the eective action, which determines the pair production probability. resumma-
tions of leading borel approximations exponentiate to give perturbative corrections to the exponents
in the non-perturbative pair production rates. comparison with a wkb analysis suggests that these
divergence properties are general features of derivative expansions and eective actions.

i. introduction

the eective action plays a central role in quantum eld theory. here we consider the one-loop eective action in

quantum electrodynamics (qed) for electrons in the presence of a background electromagnetic eld:

s = i ln det(id/  m) = 

ln det(d/2 + m2)

i
2

(1)

where d/ =  ( + iea), and a is a xed classical gauge potential with eld strength tensor f = a  a.
when the background is a static magnetic eld, the eective action s is equal to minus the eective energy of
the electrons in that background; and when the background is an electric eld, s has an imaginary part which
determines the pair-production rate for electron-positron pair creation [14]. for a uniform background eld strength
f = constant, the eective action s can be computed exactly [1,2,57]. for more general backgrounds, with f
not constant, the situation is more complicated. one standard approach is to make a derivative expansion [812]
(or gradient expansion [13]) which is a formal perturbative expansion in increasing numbers of derivatives of f :

s = s(0)[f ] + s(2)[f, (f )2] + . . .

(2)

in this paper we address two questions concerning the qed eective action s in a nonuniform background. first, we
consider the convergence/divergence properties of the perturbative derivative expansion in (2). second, we ask how
such a perturbative expansion can lead to corrections to schwingers nonperturbative pair-production rate (computed
for a constant background) when there are inhomogeneities in the background electric eld. we can answer these
questions precisely by considering some exactly solvable cases with special inhomogeneous backgrounds [1416]. the
derivative expansion is found to be a divergent asymptotic series, and the rate of divergence at high orders can be
used to compute the corresponding non-perturbative imaginary part of the eective action when the background is a
time-dependent electric eld. this divergence of the derivative expansion is not a bad thing; it is completely analogous
to generic behavior that is well known in perturbation theory in both quantum eld theory and quantum mechanics.
for example, dyson [17] argued that qed perturbation theory cannot be convergent as an expansion in the ne
structure constant , because the theory is unstable when  is negative. (the divergent and asymptotic nature of
eld theoretic perturbation theory was also found in scalar 3 theories [18]). in fact, the euler-heisenberg-schwinger
qed eective action in a constant background, and the qed eective action in the inhomogeneous backgrounds
discussed in this paper, provide explicit demonstrations of dysons argument.

our analysis of the convergence/divergence properties of the qed eective action uses borel summation [19,20],
a mathematical tool that can be used to relate the rate of divergence of high orders of perturbation theory to non-
perturbative decay and tunneling rates, thereby providing a bridge between perturbative and non-perturbative physics.
other well known explicit cases of this connection appear in quantum mechanical examples such as the anharmonic
oscillator [21] and the stark eect [22], and in quantum eld theory in semi-classical analyses of scalar eld theories

1

[23] and asymptotic estimates of large orders of qed perturbation theory [24]. for an excellent review of a broad
range of examples, see ref. [25]. typically one nds that in a stable situation (i.e., no tunneling or decay processes)
perturbation theory is divergent, with expansion coecients that alternate in sign and grow factorially in magnitude.
on the other hand, in an unstable situation, perturbation theory is generally divergent with coecients that grow
factorially in magnitude but do not alternate in sign. borel summation is an approach to the summation of divergent
series that makes physical sense out of these two dierent types of behavior. we shall see that the divergence of the
derivative expansion can be understood naturally in this borel framework.

in addition to these theoretical considerations of understanding the connections between the perturbative derivative
expansion and non-perturbative pair-production rates, another motivation for this work is provided by the attempt to
observe electron-positron pair creation due to qed vacuum eects in the presence of strong electric elds. schwingers
constant eld pair-production rate is far too small to be accessible with present electric eld strengths. however, the
constant eld approximation is somewhat unrealistic, and so one can ask how this rate is modied by a time variation
of the electric background. for sinusoidal time variation brezin and itzykson found a wkb result with fairly weak
frequency dependence [26], while balantekin et al have applied group theory and uniform wkb to electric backgrounds
with more general time dependence [27]. the qed eective action has recently been computed [15] as a closed form
(single integral) expression for the particular time-dependent electric background with e(t) = e sech2(t/ ), and in
this paper we consider the numerical implications of this result for pair-production rates in such a background. it is
important to note that another related approach to observing pair-production is to use highly relativistic electrons as
intermediate states, as has been done in recent experiments [28,29].

finally, we note that the derivative expansion (2) is an example of an eective eld theory expansion [30], such as
is used in operator product expansions [31] and chiral perturbation theory [32]. in the eective eld theory approach,
the mass m of the electrons (which are integrated out in the one-loop approximation) sets an energy scale, and the
physics at energies e  m should be described by a low energy eective action with the formal expansion

s = m4 xn

an

o(n)
mn

(3)

where o(n) is an operator of dimension n. for the case of the qed eective action, the simplest way to produce
higher-derivative operators in such an expansion is to take higher powers of the eld strength f . thus, even the leading
(i.e. constant background) term s(0)[f ] in the derivative expansion (2) is itself an eective eld theory expansion
of the form (3). this is simply the euler-heisenberg eective action which is a perturbative series expansion in
powers of e2f 2/m4. this series is known to be divergent [3335], and there are important physical consequences
of this divergence, as we review below. another way to produce higher dimension operators in the expansion (3)
is to include derivatives of f , with each derivative balanced by an inverse power of m. this is what is done in the
derivative expansion (2). thus, we can view the derivative expansion (2) as a double series expansion, both in
powers of f and in derivatives of f . in this paper we study the divergence properties of such an expansion. it has
been suggested, based on the behavior of the constant eld case [36], that the eective eld theory expansion (3) is
generically divergent. here we provide an explicit demonstration of this divergence for inhomogeneous background
elds.

for energies well below the scale set by the fermion mass m, the divergent nature of the eective action is not
important, as the rst few terms provide an accurate approximation. however, the divergence properties do become
important when the external energy scale approaches the fermion mass scale m, and/or when the inhomogeneity scale
becomes short compared to a characteristic scale of the system. the divergence is also important for understanding
how the non-perturbative imaginary contributions to the eective action arise from real perturbation theory.

in section ii we review briey the mathematical technique of borel summation, and in section iii we apply this to
the euler-heisenberg-schwinger constant-background eective action. section iv gives the borel summation analysis
of the particular exactly solvable cases with inhomogeneous magnetic and electric backgrounds. in section v we show
how this is related to a wkb analysis, and section vi contains some concluding remarks.

ii. brief review of borel summation

in this section we review briey the basics of borel summation [19,20]. consider an asymptotic series expansion of

some function f (g)

f (g) 

an gn



xn=0

(g  0+)

(4)

where g > 0 is a (small) dimensionless perturbation expansion parameter and the an are real coecients.
in an
extremely broad range of physics applications [25,35] it has been found that perturbation theory leads not to a
convergent series but to a divergent series like (4) in which the expansion coecients an have large-order behavior of
the form

n(cid:19)(cid:21)
an  (1)nn(n + )(cid:20)1 + o(cid:18) 1

(n  )

(5)

for some real constants ,  > 0, and . when  > 0, the perturbative expansion coecients an alternate in sign
and their magnitude grows factorially. borel summation is a particularly useful approach for this case of a divergent,
but alternating series. we shall see below that non-alternating series must be treated somewhat dierently.

consider, for example, the asymptotic series (4) with an = (1)nnn!, and  > 0. this series is clearly divergent
for any value of the expansion parameter g. borel summation of this divergent series can be motivated by the following
formal procedure. write

and then formally interchange the order of summation and integration, to yield

0

ds (cid:18) 1

1 + s(cid:19) exp(cid:20)

s

g(cid:21)

(g  0+)

(6)

(7)

this integral is convergent for all g > 0, and so can be used to dene the sum of the divergent seriesp
n=0(1)nnn!gn.
to be more precise, the formula (7) should be read from right to left: for g  0+, we can use laplaces method [20] to
make an asymptotic expansion of the integral, and we obtain the asymptotic series in (4) with expansion coecients
an = (1)nnn!.
the borel integral (7) can be analytically continued o the g > 0 axis and in this case is in fact [19,20] an analytic
function of g in the cut g plane: |arg(g)| < . thus, we can use a simple dispersion relation (using the discontinuity
across the cut along the negative g axis) to dene the imaginary part of f (g) for negative values of the expansion
parameter:

imf (g) 


g

exp[

1
g

]

(g  0+)

(8)

note, of course, that an alternating series with negative g is the same as a non-alternating series with positive g. if
the expansion coecients in (4) are non-alternating (with g > 0) then the situation is very dierent, both physically
and mathematically. formal application of borel summation yields

(g  0+)

(9)

this borel integral has a pole on the integration contour. however, a principal parts prescription for such a pole
gives an imaginary part in agreement with (8). this imaginary contribution is non-perturbative (it clearly does not
have an expansion in positive powers of g) and has important physical consequences. generically, the borel technique

3

signals the possible presence of such non-perturbative physics if the perturbative expansion coecients grow rapidly
(factorially) in magnitude and are non-alternating. the associated dispersion relations provide a bridge between the
perturbative physics [i.e. the ans] and the non-perturbative imaginary parts [i.e. the exp( 1
g ) factors]. we will see
explicit examples of this below.

we should note at this point that for a general divergent series these borel dispersion relations may be complicated
by the appearance of additional poles and/or cuts in the complex g plane. physically interesting poles, known as
renormalons, are indeed found in certain resummations of perturbation theory for both qed and qcd [3739]. here,
for the one-loop qed eective action in a xed external background we nd that we do not encounter such poles.

the borel summation construction discussed above for the case an = (1)nnn!, generalizes in the obvious way
to the case where the perturbative coecients are an = (1)nn(n + ), which corresponds to the leading-order
growth indicated in (5):

notice that the parameter  aects the exponent, while the combination 

 is important for the prefactor.

these last two formulas, the borel integral (10) and the borel dispersion relation (11), will be used repeatedly

below.

iii. euler-heisenberg-schwinger effective action

now consider applying this borel summation machinery to qed eective actions. eective actions can be expanded
perturbatively in terms of the coupling constant e, and also in terms of derivatives of the background eld strength
f . to begin, we review the well-known euler-heisenberg-schwinger eective action which corresponds to a uniform
background eld strength; thus the only expansion is in terms of the perturbative coupling constant e. we consider
rst a magnetic background, and then we consider an electric background. for a uniform background magnetic eld
of strength b, the exact renormalized eective action can be expressed as a proper-time integral [2]

s term is a subtraction of the zero eld (b = 0) eective action, while the s

the 1
3 subtraction corresponds to a loga-
rithmically divergent charge renormalization [2]. the l3t factor is the space-time volume factor. it is straightforward
to develop, for small eb

m2 , an asymptotic expansion of this integral:

here the b2n are bernoulli numbers [40]. the perturbative series (13) is the euler-heisenberg [1,5] perturbative
expression for the qed eective action in a uniform magnetic background b. it is an expansion in powers of the

4

coupling e, with the nth power of e being associated with a one-fermion-loop diagram with n external photon lines [we
have not included the divergent o(e2) self-energy term as it contributes to the bare action by charge renormalization].
note that only even powers of eb appear in the perturbative expansion (13). this is due to charge conjugation
invariance (furrys theorem). the expansion (13) is also an expansion in inverse powers of m2, as is familiar for an
eective eld theory action (3), with the higher dimensional operators in the expansion simply being higher powers
of b2.

the euler-heisenberg perturbative eective action (13) is not a convergent series. rather, it is an asymptotic series

of the form (4) with expansion parameter

g =

4e2b2

m4

(14)

the expansion coecients in (13) alternate in sign [because: sign(b2n) = (1)n+1], and grow factorially in magnitude:

an =

(2n + 4)(2n + 3)(2n + 2)

 (1)n+1

2

(2)2n+4 (2n + 2)

, n  

(15)

the growth of these coecients is of the form indicated in the example in (5), with  = 1
42 , and  =  = 2.
therefore, the euler-heisenberg series (13) is an example of a divergent but borel summable series. if we keep just
the leading large-n behavior for the coecients an indicated in (15), then we can immediately read o from the borel
summation formula (10) the leading-order borel approximation for the sum of the divergent series (13):

(16)

it is straightforward to evaluate this integral numerically, and one nds approximately 10  15% agreement with the
exact answer (12) even when the perturbative expansion parameter g is as large as 50, as is shown in figure 1. (note
that (15) suggests it is perhaps more natural to take the expansion parameter to be g/(2)2  g/40, so we have
plotted the leading borel approximation (16) for g up to 50.)

taking the rst three terms in (18).

but in this case we can do much better, because we are in the unusual situation of knowing the exact perturbative

expansion coecients an for all n (not simply their leading-order growth):

(17)

for each k in this sum, the coecient is once again of the leading form in (5), with  = 1
we can apply the borel summation formula (10) directly to yield

the sum over k gives successive corrections to the leading borel approximation in (16). the contributions with one,
two and three terms are plotted in figure 1, each compared to the exact result (12). note that only three terms are
needed to obtain 1% accuracy, even when the expansion parameter g is as large as 50. in fact, the expansion [41]

(19)

together with the fact that (2)  p

k=1 1/k2 = 2/6, shows that the borel integral (18) agrees precisely with the
schwinger proper-time result (12). that is, schwingers formula (12) can be viewed as the borel sum of the (divergent)
euler-heisenberg perturbative series (13). or, in other words, the euler-heisnberg perturbative series (13) can be
obtained by an asymptotic expansion of schwingers integral representation formula (12), when eb

m2 is small.

to get a sense of the size of the expansion parameter (14) appearing in the euler-heisenberg series, it is instructive

to re-instate factors of h and c:

mc2!2
g = 4  h eb

mc

phc/(eb)!4
= 4  h/(mc)

(20)

the rst equality in (20) expresses g in terms of the square of the ratio of the cyclotron energy hc to the electron
rest mass energy mc2, while the second equality expresses it in terms of the fourth power of the ratio of the electron
compton wavelength h
eb set by the magnetic eld. the critical magnetic eld
strength at which the dimensionless parameter g in (20) is order 1 is bc = 1
eh  1013 gauss. this is well above
2
currently available laboratory static magnetic eld strengths, which are approximately 105  106 gauss, in which case
g  1016  1014 is extremely small. however, the critical eld bc is comparable to the scale of magnetic eld
strengths observed in astrophysical objects such as supernovae and neutron stars which can have magnetic elds of
the order of 1015 gauss [42].

now consider the euler-heisenberg-schwinger eective action in a uniform background electric eld of strength e,
instead of the uniform magnetic background b. perturbatively, the only dierence is that b2 is replaced by e2,
which amounts to changing the sign of the expansion parameter g in (14). therefore, in a uniform electric background,
the euler-heisenberg perturbative eective action (13) becomes a non-alternating series

(21)

(recall that sign(b2n+4) = (1)n+1, so (1)nb2n+4 is non-alternating.) this series is clearly divergent and since the
coecients are non-alternating, it is not borel summable. nevertheless, using the borel dispersion relations we can
extract the imaginary part of the eective action. if we keep just the leading large-n growth (15) of the expansion

coecients, then we can immediately read o from the borel dispersion relation result (11) the leading behavior of
the imaginary part of the eective action in the electric background:

this imaginary part has direct physical signicance - it gives half the electron-positron pair production rate in the
uniform electric eld e [2]. actually, as in the magnetic case, we can do better than just the leading behavior (22).
combining the expansion coecients (17) with the borel dispersion formula (11) we immediately nd

which is schwingers classic result [2].

note that in the electric case the relevant small dimensionless parameter is [compare with (20)]

eeh/(mc)

mc2

(23)

(24)

which is (up to a factor of ) the ratio of the work done by the electric eld e accelerating a particle of charge e
through an electron compton wavelength, to the energy required for pair production. for typical electric elds this
is a very small number, so the exponential factors in (22) and (23) are extremely small. the critical electric eld
at which the non-perturbative factors become signicant is ec = m2c3
eh  1016 v cm1. this is still several orders of
magnitude beyond the eld obtainable in current lasers [29].
to conclude this section, we stress that this constant-eld case provides an explicit example of dysons argument
[17] that qed perturbation theory cannot be convergent as a series in the ne structure constant  = e2
4 , because
this would mean that the stable vacuum, with  positive, is smoothly connected to the unstable vacuum, with 
negative, at least in a small neighborhood of the origin. the perturbative euler-heisenberg series in (13) and (21) are
expansions in powers of e2b2/m4 and e2e2/m4, respectively. changing from a magnetic background to an electric
background involves replacing e2b2 with e2e2, which amounts to changing the sign of e2 (i.e., the ne structure
constant), since e always appears as eb or ee. if the euler-heisenberg perturbative series were convergent, then the
change from e2b2 to e2e2 would not produce any non-perturbative imaginary part in the eective action. thus
there would be no pair production and we would miss the genuine physical instability of the qed vacuum in an
external electric eld. hence the euler-heisenberg perturbative series cannot be convergent.

iv. solvable inhomogeneous backgrounds

so far, we have re-phrased well-known qed results in the language of borel summation. now we turn to the main
point of this paper, which is to go beyond the euler-heisenberg-schwinger constant eld results for the qed eective
action. perturbatively, this leads to a derivative expansion (2) which is a formal expansion in increasing numbers of
derivatives of the background eld strength

s = s(0)[f ] + s(2)[f , f] + . . .

(25)

where s(0) involves no derivatives of the background eld strength f , while the rst correction s(2) involves two
derivatives of the eld strength, and so on. the increasing powers of derivatives are balanced by increasing powers of
1/m.

unfortunately, it is very dicult to say anything precise about the convergence or divergence of such a derivative
expansion because it is not an actual series, as in (4), in terms of a dimensionless expansion parameter. for a general
background there is a rapid proliferation of the number of independent terms with a given number of derivatives of
the eld strength (see [9,11] for the rst order and [12] for higher orders). even a rst order derivative expansion

7

calculation is quite non-trivial. moreover, for a general background eld, it is extremely dicult to estimate and
compare the magnitude of the various terms in the derivative expansion (25). so a perturbative analysis to high
orders in a derivative expansion appears prohibitively dicult for a general background eld strength. this makes
it dicult to reconcile a perturbative derivative expansion calculation with the calculation of the non-perturbative
imaginary part of the eective action for an electric background. we explore this question below.

as a rst step towards overcoming these obstacles, we can consider restricted classes of special backgrounds for
which the derivative expansion reduces to a manageable form. the qed eective action has recently been computed
exactly for either (not both) of the following special inhomogeneous background magnetic [14] and electric elds [15]:

~b(x) = ~b sech2(

~e(t) = ~e sech2(

x

t


)

)

(26)

it has of course long been known that the dirac equation is exactly solvable for such backgrounds, a fact that has
permitted many authors to study the qed eective action in these backgrounds [43,45,46]. the new feature of [14,15]
is that all the momentum traces have been performed so that the eective action is expressed as a simple integral
representation [involving a single integral], as in schwingers classic result (12) for the uniform background eld. this
then permits the expansion of the eective action as a true series, whose convergence/divergence properties can be
studied in detail.

on the right side of (26), ~b and ~e are constant vectors. thus, ~b(x) points in a xed direction in space and is
static, but its magnitude varies in the x direction, with a characteristic length scale  that is arbitrary. similarly, ~e(t)
points in a xed direction in space and is spatially uniform, but its magnitude varies in time, with a characteristic
time scale  that is arbitrary. these electric and magnetic elds satisfy the homogeneous maxwell equations, but
not the inhomogeneous ones, so classically we should think of them as being supported by external currents. within
a quantum path integral they simply correspond to some particular vector potential a. note that in the limits
   and    we regain the uniform eld cases relevant for the euler-heisenberg-schwinger eective action.
we therefore expect that, for the inhomogeneous backgrounds (26), the derivative expansion of the eective action
should correspond to an expansion for large  and large  . we concentrate rst on the magnetic eld case, and then
use a duality transformation b  ie to convert to the electric eld case.
parameter for the derivative expansion in the magnetic case is (restoring factors of h and c)

since each derivative of the magnetic eld in (26) produces a factor of 1

 , a natural dimensionless expansion

hc

eb2 = phc/(eb)



!2

(27)

this dimensionless parameter is the square of the ratio of the magnetic length scale q hc
eb (which is set by the
peak magnetic eld magnitude b  | ~b|) to , the length scale of the spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic eld.
alternatively, we can combine this with the dimensionless perturbation parameter (20) of the constant eld case, to
obtain another dimensionless expansion parameter

(cid:18) hc

m2c3(cid:19) =

 (cid:19)2
m2c22 =(cid:18) h/(mc)

which is essentially (up to factors of 2) the square of the ratio of the compton wavelength of the electron to the
inhomogeneity scale . thus, for a magenetic background with a macroscopic inhomogeneity scale , the ratio
m22
is extremely small. in this form, we clearly recognize the derivative expansion as an expansion in inverse powers of
m2, as in a general eective eld theory expansion (3).

indeed, these expectations are borne out by the exact renormalized eective action [14], which has the double

in (29) it is understood that the double sum excludes the (j = 0, k = 1) term, as this term contributes to the
logarithmically divergent charge renormalization of the bare action [2,14].

we emphasize that the summation indexed by j in (29) corresponds precisely to the orders of the derivative
expansion. this has been veried [14] by comparison with independent derivative expansion calculations of the
leading and rst-correction term, computations that were done using the proper-time method [10,11]. for example, to
make the comparison with the leading term of the derivative expansion we simply take the euler-heisenberg constant
 sech4n(x)dx =
eld answer (13), replace b by b(x) = b sech2( x
(2n)/(2n + 1/2). this reproduces the j = 0 term in (29). a similar argument [14] holds for the rst correction
term in the derivative expansion, which reproduces the j = 1 term in (29).

a. leading order in derivative expansion

consider a xed order j of the derivative expansion. this still involves a perturbative expansion in powers of the

coupling e. for j = 0, from (29) we see that the perturbative expansion in the magnetic case is

thus, we are in the situation described by (5). therefore, this leading order (j = 0) in the derivative expansion is
a divergent but borel summable series [this is hardly surprising, as we already showed in the previous section that
the euler-heisenberg eective action is itself a divergent but borel summable series]. applying the borel summation
formula (10), the leading borel approximation for the series (30) is

now consider the j = 0 term of the derivative expansion for the inhomogeneous electric background e(t) =
e sech2(t/ ). perturbatively, we replace b2 by e2 in the expansion (30), so that the expansion coecients are now
non-alternating. thus, in the electric case the series is divergent but not borel summable. nevertheless, we can use
the borel dispersion relations (11) to compute the imaginary part of the eective action. a direct application of (11)

c. resumming the derivative expansion

having veried explicitly that the borel techniques work for the rst two orders of the derivative expansion, for
both the magnetic and electric background, we now turn to the higher orders j  2 of the derivative expansion.
these are very dicult to compute with eld theory techniques [12]. nevertheless, for the particular inhomogeneous
backgrounds in (26), the exact result (29) contains all orders in the derivative expansion, and so it is a simple matter
to study the divergence properties of each order j of the derivative expansion.

from (29), the jth order derivative expansion contribution to the eective action is (j  1)

(44)

these coecients alternate in sign and grow factorially with k, for any xed j  1. therefore, for the inhomogeneous
magnetic background in (26), each order of the derivative expansion is a divergent but borel summable asymptotic
series. using the leading large k behavior in (44) together with the borel integral (7), the leading borel approximation
to the jth order of the derivative expansion is (for j  1)

note the remarkable fact that these leading borel approximations, for each order j of the derivative expansion, can be
resummed into an exponential. the j = 0 term must be treated separately [because the sum in (29) begins at k = 2
when j = 0, because of charge renormalization]. combining the j = 0 result (30) with the j  1 result (45) we nd

the rst term is a nite charge renormalization, on top of the usual innite charge renormalization for the uniform
eld case [2]. in the second term, we see the interesting result that the leading borel approximations to each order of
the derivative expansion exponentiate when they are resummed.

a similar phenomenon occurs with the electric background. for any j  1, a straightforward application of the

borel dispersion result (11), using the growth estimate of the coecients in (44) gives

in fact, comparing with (35) we see that this result for the imaginary part also holds for j = 0. thus, resumming the

(48)

it is very interesting to see that the leading borel approximations to each order of the derivative expansion can be
resummed into an exponentiated form. thus, resumming the leading borel contributions amounts to a resummed
perturbative modication of the non-perturbative exponent m2
ee in the schwinger uniform eld result (22). clearly,
the modication of the exponent derived in (48) is much more signicant than a modication of the prefactor, which
is all that is obtained by looking at a single (low) order of the derivative expansion [11,15]. we stress that we are able
to exponentiate the corrections because in this case we know the large order perturbative behavior for every order of
the derivative expansion. finally, notice the appearance of the dimensionless parameter m
ee in the correction to the
exponent in (48). we will address the signicance of this parameter below.

d. divergence of the derivative expansion

in the previous section we took the leading borel approximation to the perturbative expansion [the sum over k in
(29)] and then performed the derivative expansion [the sum over j in (29)] exactly. actually, it is possible to re-sum
the perturbative k expansion in (29), and express it as an integral. that is, we can write the eective action as a
single (derivative expansion) series:

m22(cid:19)j

(

m22  0+)

(49)

where the expansion coecients aj are now functions of the parameter eb
m2 . to study the divergence properties of this
derivative expansion we need to know the rate of growth, for large j, of the expansion coecients aj appearing in (49).
for j  3 there is a simple integral representation for these coecients [this amounts to summing the perturbative
expansion in the double series (29), thereby reducing (29) to the single series in (49)]:

for any j it is straightforward to evaluate these coecients aj numerically for various values of the dimensionless
parameter eb
m2 . we nd that the coecients aj alternate in sign and grow in magnitude (for large j) like j(2j + ),
with some real , . this is illustrated in figure 2, where the ratio of successive magnitudes |aj+1|/|aj| shows a clear
quadratic growth, for various values of eb
m2 . this shows that the derivative expansion itself (49) is a divergent but
borel summable asymptotic series.

1of course, the nite renormalization found in the magnetic case (46) does not aect the imaginary part of the eective action

in the electric case.

e. resumming the perturbative expansion

in this section we apply the leading borel approximation to the derivative expansion, for a given order of the

perturbative expansion, and then re-sum the perturbative expansion.
first, take a xed order k  2 of the perturbative expansion in (29)

(53)

thus, the coecients a(k)
order of perturbation theory in eb

j

alternate in sign and grow factorially with j, for any xed k  2. therefore, for any xed

m2 , the derivative expansion is a divergent but borel summable asymptotic series.

now consider resumming the leading borel summation of each order k of the perturbative expansion for the
inhomogeneous electric background in (26). from (53) and the borel dispersion relation (11) the imaginary part of
the eective action at order k of the perturbative expansion is

(55)

13

once again, we see that the resummation of the leading borel contributions exponentiates, producing an exponent
that is modied from that found in the schwinger uniform eld result (22).

however, the exponential behavior in (55) is very dierent from the exponential behavior in (48), and indeed from
the exponential behavior in the uniform case (22). to understand this dierence, we rst recall that the exponential
behavior in (48) was obtained by resumming the leading borel approximations to each order of the derivative expan-
sion, while the exponential behavior in (55) was obtained by resumming the leading borel approximations to each
order of the perturbative expansion. that is, to obtain (48) we take the leading borel approximation for the k sum-
mation in (29), for each xed j, and then resum over j; while to obtain (55) we take the leading borel approximation
for the j summation in (29), for each xed k, and then resum over k.

the dierence between these two approaches is governed by the relative size of the two dimensionless expansion
m2 is small, and in the derivative expansion we assume
1
m is small. the distinction between the two answers (48) and (55) depends on the dimensionless combination:

(56)

(58)

therefore, in this regime we expect the leading exponential contribution to ims to be the schwinger uniform eld
factor exp( m2

corrections to this leading exponent

which has the form of a small correction in terms of the parameter m

where in the perturbative regime the parameter ee

now ask the question: how does the time dependence of the inhomogeneous electric background in (26) modify
schwingers constant eld result (22)? the answer depends critically on how the characteristic time scale  of the
inhomogeneity relates to the time scale m
ee set by the peak electric eld e. this then determines [see (56)] the relative
magintude of the two expansion parameters

to the perturbative expansion).

note that, in each case, our ability to treat the remaining sum exactly relied on the fact that the leading borel
approximations came out in a form that could be exponentiated.
it is not a priori obvious that this dramatic
simplication had to occur. however, in the next section we will see that this exponentiation is very natural in terms
of a wkb formulation.

m2  1

v. relation to wkb analysis

in a general background, f = f (~x, t), the eective action is too complicated to permit such a detailed borel
analysis as has been done in the previous sections for the uniform background and for the special inhomogeneous
backgrounds in (26). clearly, we do not know the spectrum of the dirac operator for a general background, so
some sort of approximate expansion method, such as the derivative expansion, is required. but the formal derivative
expansion (25) is not a series expansion, because more and more (independent) tensor structures appear with each
new order of the derivative expansion. this is because with more derivatives there are more indices to be contracted in
various ways. another way of saying this is that the inhomogeneity of a general background cannot be characterized
by a single (or even a nite number of) scale parameter(s), such as the length scale  or the time scale  in (26).
another problem is that in general it is dicult to estimate the size of various terms in such a derivative expansion
when the background eld strength f is an arbitrary function of space-time. so, even if we could organize the
derivative expansion into a sensible series, it would be dicult to estimate the magnitude of the coecients at very
high orders in the series, as is needed for a borel analysis.

nevertheless, it is still instructive to consider a further generalization of the particular inhomogeneous backrounds
in (26). in this section we relax the condition that we know the exact spectrum of the dirac operator, but keep
the restriction that the backgrounds only depend on one space-time coordinate. this has the eect of reducing the
spectral problem to that of an ordinary dierential operator. as is clear from (1), the eective action is determined
by the spectrum of the operator

m2 + d2/ =(cid:2)m2 + dd(cid:3) 1 +

e
2

f 

(62)

where   i
2 [, ]. if we restrict our attention to inhomogeneous backgrounds that point in a xed direction in
space (say, the z direction) and depend on just one space-time coordinate, then the operator in (62) can be diagonalized
with a suitable gauge choice and a suitable dirac basis. for example, the spatially inhomogeneous magnetic eld

can be realized with the vector potential ~a = (0, b f ( x
gamma matrices, the operator m2 + d2/ is diagonal, with diagonal entries (appearing twice each on the diagonal):

 ), 0). then, in the standard dirac representation [47] for the

therefore, in each case (63) and (65), the spectrum is determined by a one-dimensional ordinary dierential operator.
however, note the appearance of the factors of i in the electric case (66). this shows immediately the fundamental
dierence between a magnetic background and an electric background. in the magnetic case, the eigenvalues of the
associated ordinary dierential operator are real, while for the electric case, the eigenvalues of the associated ordinary
dierential operator have an imaginary part. (note that in the magnetic case the boundary condition for the ordinary
dierential operator is for solutions that decay at x = , while in the electric case we seek solutions going like
eit at t = , corresponding to the particle/antiparticle pair [26,45]. the reader is encouraged to check all this
explicitly for the simple case of a uniform background.)
schwingers uniform eld case corresponds to choosing the function f appearing in (63) and (65) to be f (u) = u,
while the inhomogeneous backgrounds in (26) correspond to choosing f (u) = tanh(u). it is well known that in each
case the spectrum of the associated ordinary dierential operator in (64) and (66) is exactly solvable [48]. this explains
why it is possible to compute the eective action exactly for these backgrounds. for the more general elds in (63)
and (65) it is not possible to nd the exact spectrum. however, we can still use a wkb approach to approximate
the spectrum. for a time-dependent, but spatially uniform, electric background this leads to the following wkb
expression for the imaginary part of the eective action [27,15,16]

for the electric eld in (65). the integration in (68) is between the turning points of the integrand [this expression
is somewhat symbolic - in practice, the evaluation of  requires careful phase choices, depending on the form of the
function f (u) [26,27,16]]. for the constant eld case, with f (u) = u, one nds

then the momentum integrals in (67) can be done [recall the density of states integral: r dkz = e] to yield the

(71)

it is a straightforward, but somewhat messy, computation to check that by doing the momentum integrals in (67)
with this expression for , one arrives at the exact integral representation, derived in [15], for the eective action in
this inhomogeneous background. the wkb expression gives the exact result in this case because the uniform wkb
approximation gives the exact spectrum of the dierential operators (64) and (66) when f (u) = tanh(u) [49].

now consider this wkb exponent  in (71) in the non-perturbative and perturbative limits (57).

doing the momentum trace over kz, the momentum in the direction of the eld, in the wkb expression (67) modies
the prefactor, but not the exponent. the traces over the transverse momenta can be done by approximating  =
2m + . . .. this eectively replaces  with m in (72) and (73), and the k integrals in (67) contribute
to the prefactor. then comparing (72) and (73) with (59) and (61), we see that we regain exactly the borel resummed
results (48) and (55) obtained for the two extreme limits (57). thus, this wkb analysis explains why we found two
dierent expressions, (48) and (55), by borel resummation of the double series (29), depending on the relative size of
the two dimensionless expansion parameters.

to conclude this discussion of the wkb approach, it is instructive to compare the e(t) = e sech2(t/ ) case with
the case of an oscillating electric eld e(t) = e sin(t) which was studied in detail using wkb methods by brezin
and itzykson [26]. this is not an exactly solvable case, but wkb provides a semiclassical result. here f (u) =  cos(u)
and so the wkb exponent is

this is a perturbative expression, with the perturbative parameter (ee/(m))2 raised to a power 2m/ which is the
number of photons of frequency  required to match the pair creation energy 2m.

so, while the non-perturbative results (72) and (75) are very similar for the cases e(t) = esech2(t/ ) and e(t) =
e sin(t) respectively, the corresponding perturbative results are very dierent from one another for these two time-
dependent electric backgrounds. this dierence can be traced to the dierent perturbative limits (73) and (77) of
the wkb exponent . physically, this is not so surprising if we recall that the perturbative limits, ee
m  1 and
m  1, can also be thought of as short-pulse and high-frequency limits (respectively), in which case the sech2(t/ )
ee
and sin(t) proles of the electric background are signicantly dierent.

vi. conclusion

in conclusion, we have shown that the qed eective action is a divergent double series for the inhomogeneous
magnetic background b(x) = bsech2(x/) and for the inhomogeneous electric background e(t) = esech2(t/ ). in
particular, we have also demonstrated that for these inhomogeneous background elds the derivative expansion is
itself divergent. borel summation techniques have been used to relate the rate of divergence to the non-perturbative
imaginary part of the eective action, which determines the pair-production rate in the time-dependent electric
background. remarkably, the leading borel approximations exponentiate to yield corrections to the familiar exponent
appearing in the constant eld case. these resummations can also be explained using a wkb analysis of the imaginary
part of the eective action.

finally, we conclude by considering the question of borel summability of the perturbative eective action when the
inhomogeneous background has the more general form in (63) or (65). the exponential form of the wkb expression
(67) for the imaginary part of the eective action is very suggestive of the exponential imaginary parts found from
the borel dispersion relation (11). indeed, writing

where in the magnetic case   i. this expression is consistent with the result from the resolvent method
(although to be strictly correct we need to specify carefully phase conventions for  [15,16]). for example, in the
constant magnetic case  = 2/(eb), and it is easy to verify [recalling that r dkz = b] that the expansion (80)

interestingly, the expansion (80) is a reorganization of the usual perturbative expansion of the eective action,
and this reorganized form already makes manifest the generic divergence properties of the eective action, since the
bernoulli numbers have leading behavior b2n  (1)n+12(2n)!/(2)n. thus, we see that in the magnetic case the
expansion (80) has coecients that alternate in sign and grow factorially in magnitude. in this formal sense, the
divergence properties of the eective action discussed in this paper, for the special cases with b = constant and
b(x) = b sech2(x/), appear to extend to more general backgrounds. however, we caution that this argument is
formal, as it neglects the possible appearance of other poles and/or cuts in the borel plane which might invalidate the
naive use of the borel dispersion relation (11). nevertheless, it is suggestive to associate the non-perturbative wkb
expression (67) for the imaginary part of the eective action with the divergent expansion (80) for the real part.
