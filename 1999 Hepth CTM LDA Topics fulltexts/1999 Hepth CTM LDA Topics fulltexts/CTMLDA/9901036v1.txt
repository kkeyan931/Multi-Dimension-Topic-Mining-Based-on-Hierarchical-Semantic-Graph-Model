abstract

it is shown, how one can dene vector topological charges for topological
exitations of non-linear  -models on compact homogeneous spaces tg or
g/tg (where g is a simple compact lie group and tg is its maximal
commutative subgroup). explicit solutions for some cases, their energies and
interaction of dierent topological charges are found. a possibility of the
topological interpretation of the quantum numbers of groups and particles is
discussed.

introduction

the discovery of new topologically stable solutions [1-4] has revived the
old, ascending to antiquity, hypothesis about a topological nature of sim-
plest particles. for example, descartes oered vortex model of magnetism
[5], while lord kelvin has putted forward a conjecture that atoms can be
represented as knotted congurations of ether [6]. though it has appeared
that both conjectures are non correct they were very fruitful and have stim-
ulated the investigation of these phenomena as well as development of the
vorticity and of the knot theories [7] and their applications in dierent re-
gions of physics from hydrodynamics till polymers [8-11]. an advantage of
this idea in comparison with usual, considering simplest particles as a point-
like, structureless objects, is that it oeres an obvious image of elementary
particles. later, analogous ideas have renewed periodically in connection
with dierent events in history of physics, (the most succes they achieved in
condensed matter physics, see for example [11]), but, in the eld theory, they
usually have been based on one or another topological invariant and for this
reason a set of topological charges, oered by them, were not reach enough
for complete description of real particles with internal symmetries (there is a
huge number of literature on this subject, we note here only [12] for further
information).

a modern physics has many common properties with physics of second
part of xix century with condensate of various elds playing role of ether
or others hypotetical liquids. for this reason a rebirth of hypothesis about
topological origin of particles and their properties is very natural and it looks
attractive from physical point of view, since it brings more deep understand-
ing of the nature of particles and gives more obvious interpretation of their
structure and quantum numbers in contrast with existing formal, purely lie-
algebraic and structureless, description. to this one can add, that for this
period a topology was strongly developed and adequate mathematical meth-
ods for description and investigation of various topological problems has been
constructed (see for example [13]).

in order to this interpretation was possible, the following points are nec-

essary:

1) the corresponding eld theory must have degenerate vacuum, which

forms some manifold m with nontrivial topology,

2) a theory must have solutions with nontrivial topology and nite (or

logariphmic) energy,

2

3) the set of possible topological charges must be the same as the set of

possible quantum numbers.

the two rst points are now fullled for such topological solutions as
solitons, vortices, instantons and monopoles, but a third point remains in-
completed, at least for rst three exitations.

usually quantum numbers of particles are determined by the weights of
irreducible representations to which they belong. as is known the quantum
numbers or weights of simple compact groups g are connected with the
maximal commutative subgroup tg of g - the maximal abelian cartan
torus [14].

all possible weights of compact simple group form n -dimensional lattice
lw , where n is a rank of group g. thus, the topological charges must also
belong to the same lattice. earlier it had been shown that solitons with
topological isovectorial charges, belonging to the corresponding root, weight
and dual root lattices lr, lw, lv of groups g exist in two-dimensional theo-
ries, generalizing sine-gordon theory and connected with characters of groups
with rank n > 1 [15]. these charges can be related with homotopy group 0
of vacuum congurations of these models, which form innite discrete sets,
coinciding with those lattices.

in general a possibility of existence of topological exitations in systems
with degenerate vacuum, depends on a non-triviality of the homotopy groups
i(m) of vacuum space m. for example, to usual vortices with integer
topological charges e  z and one-dimensional instantons [16] corresponds
1(s1) = z , while the two-dimensional instantons correspond to 2(s2) = z
[4, 13]. as is shown in [17], for obtaining topological charges belonging to
weight lattice of compact simple lie group g it is necessary to consider
in case of vortices a torus tg and in a case of instantons a more special
homogeneous space of g , a ag space fg = g/tg.

in this paper we continue consideration of these manifolds m. it will be
shown how one can dene corresponding vector topological charges and some
explicit solutions with such topological charges will be found. we will deal
mainly with non-linear  -models on manifolds m, since they are eective
theories for large class of models having m as their vacuum manifolds.
we also discuss conditions under which quantum numbers of groups admit
topological interpretation.

1. manifolds with vectorial homotopy group 1

the study of the manifolds with vectorial (i.e. with rank n > 1 ) homo-
topy group it is convenient to begin with manifolds with vectorial 1(m)
groups. for our purposes it will be enough to consider only spaces with
abelian 1, since the corresponding topological charges must commute with
each other. we also conne ourselves by free homotopic groups for simplic-
ity. though their properties are simple and well known we need discus them
with a special attention paid to their vector structure, since it help us un-
der consideration of spaces with vectorial 2. the simplest generalization of
circle

s1 = e2i,

0    1

is a torus t n, which equals to the direct product of n circles

t n =

n

oi=1

s1
i .

(1)

the torus t n can be also represented as a coset space of n -dimensional
euclidean space rn

where zn is n -dimensional simple cubic integer-valued lattice

t n = rn/zn,

zn =

n

mi=1

zi

(2)

(3)

a more general n -dimensional torus tl of rank n can be dened as a factor

where l is some full n -dimensional lattice in rn

tl = rn/l

l =

n

xi=1

niei, ni  zi, ei  {ei}l,

(4)

(5)

here a set of linearly independent vectors {ei}l, i = 1, ..., n forms a basis of
lattice l . for t n {ei}l coincides with the canonical orthonormal basis

ei = (0, .., 0, 1i, 0, ..., 0), i = 1, ..., n.

4

a basis of any lattice can be choosed by many ways, all of them are related
by modular transformations

{e

i}l = m{ei}l, det(m) = 1,

(6)

where matrices m have integer-valued entries and for basises having the
same orientation det(m) = 1. usually the most convenient basis is the one
having vectors with minimal possible norms.

the rst homotopy group of torus 1(t n) , being the homotopical map-

ping classes of s1 into t n, is usually written as

1(t n) =

n

mi=1

zi = zn,

(7)

where i -th component describes mappings of s1 into i -th circle of t n. it is
clear that mapping from dierent components cannot annihilate each other.
the same expression is often used for other tori tl. then this form indicates
only that coordinates of dierent homotopical classes are integer-valued in
some basis, but does not contain any information about this basis. it means
that one must introduce in 1(tl) a vectorial structure.

to nd out an explicit form of this basis one can take into account a
quotient nature of tl. then it is desirable to choose it compatible with the
vectorial structure of the covering space rn. the most natural way to do this
is to conserve the euclidean vectorial structure of rn and of l, embedded
into it. then one comes to the next expression for 1(tl)

1(tl) = l

(8)

where now l contains in explicit form its basic vectors ei. this form can
have more information than (7), since, except of integer-valuedness of ho-
motopical classes ( ni  zi ), it contains geometrical characteristics of tl.
one need also to know metric and corresponding scalar product in space of
topological charges, which may dier from that of covering space (see be-
low). they will be very important for discussion of interaction of topological
exitations with dierent topological charges.

since to each basic vector ei corresponds an elementary nontrivial ho-
mological cycle i of tl, the corresponding homological group of cycles
h1(tl, z) of torus tl coincides with 1(tl). this is a realization of the

5

gurevich theorem about isomorphism of rst non-trivial homotopic and ho-
mological groups [13]. consequently, h1(tl, z) also has vectorial structure,
which can be written as

 = x ni  i,  i = iei, ni  z.

(9)

there is also a cohomological group of 1-forms   h 1(tl, r), dual to
h1(tl, z), with basis {  i} = {sidi} and a convolution

(  i   k) = (siek)ii

dk = ik

where {si} is a basis of dual lattice l and

(siek) = ik,

(10)

(11)

here () means an euclidean scalar product.

usually the topological charges q of t n are dened as a set of integer
numbers, corresponding to the winding numbers around elementary cycles
i ,

q = (q1, ..., qn), qi  zi

(12)

the winding numbers can be written as integrals of 1-forms k , dual to the
cycles i , in the parameter space of t n

qi = ii

d = ii

n

xk=1

nkdk = ni, d =

xk=1

nkdk

or

qi = i

di =

n

xk=1

nk ik

di = ni, ii

dk = ik,  =

n

xk=1

nkk

(13)

here  and d are some closed contour and 1-form on t n . analogous
expressions for q are usually used for any tl . in this formal form all q
have the similar, integer-valued, structure and all geometrical properties are
hidden again in abstract basises of elementary cycles or 1-forms.

for obtaining vector topological charges, characterizing vectorial homo-
topic group, one can use any vector structure, mentioned above. for example,
one can lift on the covering space rn and dene topological charges q as

6

line integrals of vector 1-forms dxk (x  rn) along preimage (or pull-back)
curve  of the closed contour 

q = z 

dx =

n

xi=1

niei

(14)

the latter equality follows from the fact that both ends of curve  must
belong to the lattice l. note that the same expression can be derived if one
use the vectorial structure from (9) in the space of cycles 

q = i 

d = x nieiii

dk =

n

xi=1

niei

(15)

further we adopt a second approach, using vectorial structure of homology
group, to all considered m, since they will satisfy to conditions of the gure-
vich theorem. this choice is very obvious and usually the possible dierential
forms are xed by theory action or by symmetry properties.

thus we have introduced vectorial topological charges of torus tl , con-
taining in the explicit form the lattices basis {ei}l. for obtaining metric
and corresponding scalar product in space of topological charges one must
consider concrete realization of torus tl and a chiral model on it. torus tl
of rank n can be realized as diagonal n -dimensional matrices t

t = diag(e2i(s1), ..., e2i(sn))

(16)

where () denotes usual scalar product in n -dimensional euclidean space rn,
and a set {si} is a basis of dual lattice l from (10-11). it is easy to see
that to each elementary cycles ei corresponds one exponent in t with dual
vector si.

the lattice l is a weight lattice of torus tl, considered as a group.
for topological interpretation of all weights it is necessary that l  l. for
example, a lattice zn coincides with its dual one, consequently, all weights
of group t n have topological interpretation.

for this reason in a case of general tori tl an important role play tori,
corresponding to the self-dual lattices l = l , since for them all weights have
one to one correspondence with topological charges. but it is not enough for
exact isomorphism between them, because one must have the same metric in
space of topological charges. as we will see below, it doesnt take place for
tori tl.

7

now we pass to discussion of the compact chiral models, connected with
tl and will describe the explicit realizations of vector topological charges
introduced above. the rst model generalizes two-dimensional nonlinear  -
model on a circle s1 [19]. we will use for tl a realization in the form (16).
one can dene two-dimensional nonlinear  -model on tl by next action s
(or energy e )

s =

1

2 z d2xt r(t1

 t) =

1

2 z d2x(  ),

(17)

where t = t,  = ,  = 1, 2 and here appears new scalar product
() , dened by eective n -bein metric gik on torus space,

(  ) = x gikik,

gik =

n

xa=1

k

(18)

it easy to see that metric gik for general lattice l does not coincide (ex-
cept case of t n ) with euclidean one on rn. exactly this metric will dene
interaction of dierent vector topological charges on torus tl.

this chiral model can be considered as eective theory, corresponding in
long-wave limit to the ginzburg-landau type theories or to discrete lattice
type models with vacuum manifold m = tl. due to nontriviality of 1(tl),
it must have vortex-type solutions. these vortex solutions are ill-dened for
small scales, where the full action must be used for nding a structure of
the vortex core. but for description of the topological properties only long-
wave behavior will be important and for this reason we shall use at small
distances instead of core a short-wave cut-o parameter a, which is analog
of the lattice constant or of the core radius.

it follows
from (22) that independently on lattice l topological charges, corresponding
to dierent cycles, do not interact as in the case of torus t n! this is a
consequence of appearence of eective metric gik on tori space. energy of

(23)

and c(a) is some nonuniversal constant, determining self-energy (or core
energy) of vortices and depending on type of core regularization. thus, we
see that properties of vortex exitations of non-linear  -model on all tori tl
(with tori dimension equal to their rank, they also include complex abelian
tori) are similar to those of non-linear  -model, dened on tori t n. in
particular, the topological charges, corresponding to dierent cycles, do not
interact with each other though they belong to lattice l 6= z n .
it can
be understood, since on these tori one can always deform initial cycles into
canonical ones. at the same time this result conrms that we have introduced
vector structure correctly.

but this is not a whole story. there are tori dierent from t n and tl
types. they can be called degenerated ones because their rank n is smaller
than their dimension p. we consider them in the next section.

the second model we want to consider here is one-dimensional conformal
 -model on tl, which generalizes analogous  -model on s1. its action is
dened as

s =

where a1i, a2i are abitrary constants, characterizing place and width of cor-
responding instanton, and all topological charges qi
in (26) must satisfy
simultaneously a condition

(qisk)  0 or

(qisk)  0

(27)

for all sk, k = 1, ..., n. this condition is a generalization of analogous con-
dition in  -model on s1, which, in its turn, is an analog of analiticity (or
anti-analiticity) property of two-dimensional instantons. the corresponding
action is

(28)

such form of action, linear in q , takes place only for sets of charges, satis-
fying condition (27). for superpositions with arbitrary charges appear inter-
action between dierent charges.

2. the cartan tori

in this section we will be interested in degenerated tori, related with
maximal abelian cartan tori tg of the simple compact lie groups g . we
consider their dierent representations, corresponding homotopical groups
1(tg) and topological charges.

the cartan torus tg consists of elements

g = e2i(h  ), h = {h1, ..., hn}  c, [hi, hj] = 0,

(29)

where n is a rank of g, c is a maximal commutative cartan subalgebra
of the lie algebra g of the group g and we assume that (h) is usual
euclidean scalar product. due to their commutativity all hi can be diagonal-
ized simultaneously. their eigenvalues are called the weights w and depend
on concrete representation of g and c . the weights {wa} , a = 1, ..., p ,
belonging to a p -dimensional irreducible representation  (g) form a set of
quantum numbers of this representation.

all possible weights w of the simply connected group g or of the univer-
sal covering groups g of non-simply connected groups g form a lattice of
weights lg
w . its basis can be choosed by dierent ways. the basis, most con-
venient from the view point of the representation theory, is the so called basis

10

of fundamental weights wi, i = 1, ..., n. any weight w can be represented
in the form

n

w =

x1

ni wi,

(30)

where all ni are integers. but, in general, not all wi have a minimal norm.
in some cases more convenient is a basis of vectors with minimal norm.
as in a case of all lattices dierent basises are related by linear modular
transformations m with detm = 1 and integer coecients [13]. for
transformations, preserving an orientation of the basis, detm = 1.

the weight lattice lw and related with it root lr and dual root lv
lattices are needed for nding 1(tg), which can depend on concrete rep-
resentation  (g). the group 1(tg) can be dened in general form by the
methods of the lie groups and algebras [14], but we will use here more simple
and obvious one, analogous to one used above for tori tl . since in any irre-
ducible representation  (g) of dimension p one can choose the eigenvectors
|a > of h as a basis

h|a >= wa|a >, a = 1, ..., p,

then in this basis all hi and any element g  tg have diagonal form

g = diag(e2i(w1), ..., e2i(wp))

(31)

(32)

here again (wa) denotes an usual euclidean scalar product of the vectors
wa and  . the main dierence of this form from usual representation of
tori tl type (16) is that:

1) a dimension of diagonal matrices in (32) coincides with dimension of

 -representation p, which is usually larger, than rank of g ,

2) the set of weights {w} has discrete weyl symmetry, which ensures

weyl invariance of tg and results in the next two properties

p

xa=1

wa = 0,

gik =

p

xa=1

wa

i wa

k = b ik,

(33)

where constant b depends on representation. it follows from (33) that in
case of tg eective metric gik on the parameter space is proportional to
the euclidean one. this fact will appear very important for interaction of the
corresponding topological charges and dierence of properties of non-linear
 -models on tori tl and tg [18].

11

from (33) it is obvious, that in this representation all g  tg are periodic
with a lattice of periods l1
, dual (or inverse) to the lattice l , which is
generated by weights wa of  -representation. the point is that the lattice
l can be some sublattice of lattice lw : lw  l .



a lattice lv , inverse to lw , is called a lattice of dual roots rv. it has

its own basis of the dual roots rv

i (i = 1, ..., n)

(rv

i wk) = ik.

(34)

thus we see that for simply connected g and representations, containing
weights, belonging to the lw, but not to some its sublattice, 1(tg) is
isomorphic to the n -dimensional lattice lv of the dual roots rv (see for
example [17]). all simple compact groups g , except g = so(n) , are
simply-connected. for multiply connected g the group 1(g) is a subgroup
of a nite discrete group  a center zg , which belongs to tg  the maximum
torus of a universal covering group g. therefore, for multiply connected g
such, that g = g/1(g)

1(tg) = 1( tg)  1(g) = lg

v  1(g)

it means, that 1(tg) contains lv as a sublattice. for groups so(n)
1(so(n)) = z2 , and for the adjoint groups gad = g/zg

1(gad) = zg

for simply-laced groups g (i.e. for groups of a series an = su(n + 1), dn =
so(2n), e = e6,7,8 ) lv coincides with a lattice of all roots lr , which is
a sublattice of a lattice of weights lr  lw. the structure of all lattices
lw, lr, lv of simple compact groups g is known [14]. it is necessary to note,
that in general case they are not any more hypercubic and can belong to four
dierent series of a, d, e, z types. further we will consider only minimal
and adjoint representations. the weights of minimal representations generate
a weight lattice lw, thus a lattice of topological charges will be lattice of
dual roots lv. the weights of adjoint representation are roots and generate
root lattice lr, in this case topological charges will belong to l1
r .

it was shown in [17] that for groups g = g2, e8, cn, adan, adbn, addn
and ade6,7 the lattice of all possible topological charges l  lw, and
consequently for them there is a possibility of the topological interpretation
of all quantum numbers of these groups. there is also possibility of a

12

w . for other groups g, for which ladg

partition lg
into sets of charges, corresponding to the irreducible represen-

tations of groups g , for which lg

w (for exam-
ple, g = an, bn, dn, e6,7 ) not all sets of topological charges, answering
to some representation (for example, quark representations of groups an
or spinor representations of groups bn, dn ) will correspond to the exact
(single-valued) representations.

now let us consider two-dimensional chiral model on tori tg. the corre-

sponding action s is

s =

2 z d2xtr (g1

2 z d2xtr (h)2 =

b z d2x()2, (35)
where g = e2i(h)  tg,  = (1, ..., n), n is a rank of g,  =
,  = 1, 2, and eective metric gik , generated by weight system {w}
of  -representation, from (33) is used. it is convenient to introduce in this
model a normalized trace to avoid constant b from eective metric

1
2

t r =

tr
b

(36)

then s takes a canonical form without coecient b . the corresponding
equations of motion

()2(h) = 0,

(37)

have classical vortex-type solutions in a region r > r > a analogous to (20)

 (x) =

1


q arctan(

y  y0
x  x0

), q  l1



(38)

just these solutions for groups g, such, that l1
  lw , can give the topo-
logical interpretation of all their quantum numbers [17]. energy of these
vortices is also logariphmically divergent

e = 1/(2)z ()2d2x =

1
2

(2)(q)2 ln(r/a),

(40)

this gives nonzero logariphmic interaction between vortices with dierent
non-collinear topological charges in contrast with a case of tori tl

e =

1
2

(q1q2)2 ln |x1  x2|/a.

(41)

13

this interaction depends on relative orientation of topological charges and
for this reason a geometry of lattices becomes very important. energy of
n -vortex type solutions will have a form similar to (22) with usual scalar
product of topological charges.

now one can conclude that properties of  -models on the cartan tori will
be dierent and depending on lattice l1
 . as was mentioned above, all lat-
tices, connected with compact simple groups, belong to four series a, d, e, z
and in appropriate scales are integer-valued [20]. how they determined criti-
cal properties of topological phase transitions is considered in paper [18](see
also [15]).

it is interesting to know which spaces, besides tori, can have homotopical
group 1 of lattice type, which must be integer-valued. one must also note,
that there are spaces with 1 having some nite cyclic subgroups, but we
do not discuss them here.

one-dimensional conformal  -models on tori tg can be analysed as
those on tori tl. the single dierence will be that a sum in trace now goes
over all weights of some representation. since instantons (or anti-instantons)
do not interact between them, there will be no essential changes in proper-
ties of  -models on tori tl and tg as long as we will be interested only
unmixed congurations. but they will be dierent if one consider properties,
connected with all possible congurations.

3. manifolds with 2 = l

now we pass to consideration of manifolds m with homotopical group
2 of lattice type. the more known such manifolds can be divided into two
large classes: 1) homogeneous spaces of simple compact lie groups, 2) the
hodge submanifolds of complex projective spaces cpn, do not coinciding
with m from 1). the rst ones are the more interesting from the point of
view, accepted in this paper because they can have 2 group with topological
charges belonging to the weight lattices (or their sublattices) of the corre-
sponding groups. for nding out instanton type solutions with topological
charges q  lr the more important are the complex homogeneous spaces.
the main classication theorem about such manifolds says that all of them
can be considered as bundle spaces over some ag spaces f

m t f

where a ber t is a parallelizable space. moreover t must be some complex
torus if m is simply connected or if m is kahlerian. if both these conditions

14

take place, then m must be some ag space f [21, 22]. since 2(t ) = 0,
the most important from instantons point of view are the ag spaces f.
among them there are maximal ag spaces fg = g/tg with 2(fg) = lv
[17, 23].

the chiral models on fg were considered in papers [23, 24], where it
was shown, that since 2(g/tg) = 1( tg) 6= 0 and on g/tg there is
complex structure, the appropriate equations have holomorphic instanton
solutions. but their consideration of topological charges was carried out not
taking into account vectorial structure of corresponding group 2(fg) . the
authors have proceeded from the assumption, that appropriate topological
charges are simply integer numbers, corresponding to convolution of some
2-form with dierent 2-subspaces. since 2(g/tg) = lv , it is possible to
consider corresponding topological charges as isovectors. to see how they
can be realized, let us return to  -model on g/tg . its action has the form
[23]

s[u] =

1

2g2 z d2xgab(u, u)ua

ub, a, b = 1, ..., p, 2p + n = dimg.

(42)

here ua are complex local coordinates on g/tg , and the metric gab(u, u) is
a representative of the 2-forms from class  , where  is an isovector, equal
to a half-sum of all positive roots of lie algebra g

einstein one on g/tg [24, 25], i.e.

gab(u, u) = krab(u, u), k =

1
2

,

(43)

where rab(u, u) is the ricci tensor. such choice of invariant metric ensures
a renormalizability of (42) [24, 26].

on holomorphic elds ua(z), z  c = r2, which are the coordinates on
fg, action s formally coincides (up to coecient) with topological invariant

q =

1

2 z d2xgab(u, u)ua

ub =

2 z gabdua  d ub.

(44)

15

as is known [21, 24], all integer-valued 2-forms on fg = g/tg

 = abdua  d ub

can be decomposed (modulo exact forms) on basis of the 2-forms i, i =
1, ..., n , parametrized by fundamental weights i

 =

n

x1

cii, ci  z.

(45)

similar expansion with coecients ci = 1 has the 2-form corresponding
to the metric gab(u, u). on the other hand on g/tg there is a space of
2-cycles  , which is dual to space of the 2-forms. the 2-cycles are given
by linear combinations of the shubert cells of minimum dimension: real
dimensionality 2 or complex dimensionality 1, number of which is equal to a
rank of g [21]. since 1(fg) = 0 and according to the gurevich theorem
2(fg) = h2(fg, z) = lv, it is natural to introduce on the space of 2-cycles
a vectorial structure similar to (9) and to choose a parametrization of 2-cycles
by a lattice lv , then its basic cycles {i} are parametrized by the simple
dual roots rv

(46)

a convolution of the 2-forms i and of dual to them 2-cycles k , i.e. integral
of the 2-form i over a 2-cycle k is equal

(i  k) = zk

i = ik

since 2-form  , determining topological charges, is xed, the vectorness of
space of 2-cycles induces a vectorness of space of topological charges q

q =

i = (

from this it follows that topological charges, answering to dierent inde-
pendent cycles, cannot be simply added and, in particular, compensate each
other. for evaluations it is useful to note similarity of topological cell-like
structure of torus tg and ag g/tg in their lowest nontrivial cell com-
plexes: for a torus t n it is a bouquet of circles t n = s1
1  ...  s1
1 [13] and
for a ag space it will be an analog of bouquet of 2-spheres m = s2
1 ...s2
1 .

16

for example, for g = su(n + 1) as local coordinates on these 2-spheres
it is possible to choose the elements of upper, nearest to a main diagonal,
diagonal line. then, corresponding to these 2-spheres instantons are simply
instantons of belavin - polyakov [4]. for an action s of n instantons with
topological charges q1, ..., qn, corresponding to n dierent 2-cycles, we shall
receive

this expression is similar to that for one-dimensional instantons from (28).
thus it is shown, that instanton solutions of two-dimensional chiral the-
ories on maximal ag spaces fg = g/tg can realize isovectorial topological
charges, belonging to 2(g/tg) = lv , and therefore can realize nearly all
quantum numbers of the appropriate group g. but, as in one-dimensional
case, instantons do not interact with each other. for this reason, only instan-
tons cannot realize real particles. for their realization one need exitations,
interacting like vortices, but with coulomb or yukava type potential v (r)

e = (q1q2)v (r), vc(r) =

1
r

, vy (r) =

emr

r

such type of interaction can be obtained due to gauge elds, which appear
naturally when one consider tg and fg as submanifolds in g and takes
into account the fact that in g there is a whole set of such conjugated
submanifolds. then, if there is no xing potential, all these submanifolds
will be on equal foot. it means that corresponding  -models elds, taking
their values in these submanifolds, at dierent points of physical space can
take values in dierent submanifolds and conjugation transformations will
play a role of gauge elds. a work in this direction is now going on.

4. 3-dimensional topological exitations

topological exitations of vortex and instanton types, i.e., connected with
1(tg) and 2(fg), can exist also in three-dimensional space. vortex type
exitations will form now closed or open lines, in a latter case its energy
will be e  l ln r/a , where l is a lines length. topological exitations
connected with topological charges q  2(g/tg) can exist in the general-
ized higgs-salam-weinberg models as 3-dimensional particle-like monopoles.
they will have nite energy if corresponding gauge eld would be engaged

17

and will have divergent energy without gauge eld. it is interesting note that
since 2(fg) = lv , which in g = su(n) case does not contain weights of
the fundamental quark representations, the latter cannot exist as topologi-
cal exitations on fg. this fact demands additional factorization of fg or
spontaneous symmetry breaking if one want to get topological interpretation
of quarks also (see for example [27]).

here we discuss as an example instantons exitations connected with ho-
motopic group 2 in 3-dimensional chiral model on sphere s2 with action

s =

1

2 z d3x(n)2, n  s2

(49)

the corresponding equations have instanton type solution, which we repre-
sent in a form analogous (39)

ni(x) =

xi
r

r(r  a), ,

where r(r) is a regularized step-function. its topological charge

q =

1

4 z ds

where integral r ds is over sphere in internal space, and energy

e =

1

2 z d3x(n)2 =

1


dr 

4


r.

4z r

(52)

grows linearly with r .
it means that in this model instantons must be
conned in neutral pairs like quarks in qcd and will appear themselves only
at small distancies! all infra-red properties will not depend on their existence.
analogous properties will have  -models on other manifolds having the same
homotopical group 2 = z or of vectorlike type 2 = l as in a case of fg.
one can show (for example [14]), using exact homotopic sequence for

bundle g

tg fg and the fact, that i(tg) = 0, i > 1 ,

k(g) = k(g/tg) = k(g, tg), k = 3, 4...

this means, that for k > 2 , the ag space fg has the same homotopical
groups as group g itself. in particular, in a case of 3-dimensional non-linear

18

 -models on ag spaces fg they, probably, can have knotted congura-
tions, connected with group 3(fg) = 3(g) = z, similar to those proposed
recently for 4-dimensional yang-mills theory in [28].

all this facts about reach set of topological exitations on cartan tori tg
and ag spaces fg say that manifolds tg and fg and theories on them
or their gauge generalizations could be considered as necessary ingredient
of any high energy gut-type or string-type theories, which try to obtain
the obvious physical (in particular, topological) interpretation of elementary
particles.
