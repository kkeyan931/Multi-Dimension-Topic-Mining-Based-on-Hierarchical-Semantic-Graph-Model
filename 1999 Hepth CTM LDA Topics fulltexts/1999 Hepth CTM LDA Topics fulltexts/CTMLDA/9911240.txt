options choice gauge group, consider gauged theories maximal supersymmetry maximal so(m) gauge symmetry. theories related sphere compactication iib eleven dimensional supergravity. important stress gauged supergravity theories consistent, classical eld theories right. structure generically non-linear, particularly scalar sector. however, also important remember complete structure theories completely determined by: (i) supersymmetry, gauge global symmetries, (ii) perturbative eld content. given this, assumption second-derivative actions, noether procedure essentially unambiguous. 3 separate issue gauged supergravities may related compactications higher dimensional supergravities, indeed, one key issues whether actually embedded higher dimensional theory. since lower dimensional theory truncation higher dimensional theory subset lowest modes obvious question whether truncation consistent equations motion higher dimensional eld theory, whether lower dimensional eld theory merely eective low energy truncation. context, embedding strongest option: means equations motion higher dimensional eld theory exactly satised one satises equations motion lower dimensional theory. particular, solution lower dimensional theory automatically yields solution higher dimensional theory. embedding, consistent truncation trivial toroidal compactications one takes elds independent toroidal coordinates, highly non-trivial sphere compactications lead maximal gauged supergravities. embedding gauged supergravity almost completely proven s7 compactication s4 compactication eleven
