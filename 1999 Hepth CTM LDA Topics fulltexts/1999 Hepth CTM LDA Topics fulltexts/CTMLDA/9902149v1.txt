theory, goteborg, august 20-22, 1998.

1 introduction

the original study of supermembranes [1] was motivated by the desire to nd
a consistent quantum-mechanical extension of 11-dimensional supergravity [2]
along the same lines that string theory denes a quantum-mechanical exten-
sion of 10-dimensional supergravity theories. in 11 spacetime dimensions the
supermembrane can consistently couple to a superspace background that satis-
es a number of constraints which are equivalent to the supergravity equations
of motion. the supermembrane action can also exist in 4, 5 and 7 spacetime
dimensions, just as the green-schwarz superstring [3] is classically consistent
in 3, 4, 6 and 10 dimensions. guided by string theory it was natural to expect
that the massless states of the supermembrane would correspond to those of 11-
dimensional supergravity. however, the supermembrane mass spectrum turned
out to be continuous [4] and in that situation it was cumbersome to directly
prove or disprove the possible existence of massless states [5, 6]. the dicul-
ties in making sense of the supermembrane mass spectrum and the fact that
11-dimensional supergravity seemed to have no place in string theory, formed
an obstacle for subsequent development of the theory. more recently, however,
interest in supermembranes was rekindled by the realization that 11-dimension-
al supergravity does have its role to play as the long-distance approximation
to m-theory [7, 8, 9, 10]. m-theory is the conjectured framework for unifying
all ve superstring theories and 11-dimensional supergravity. it turns out that
supermembranes, m-theory and super matrix theory are all intricately related.
an important observation was that it is possible to regularize the superme-
mbrane in terms of a super matrix model based on some nite group, such as

1

u(n ). in the limit of innite n one then recovers the supermembrane [5]. these
supersymmetric matrix models were constructed long ago [11] and can be ob-
tained from supersymmetric yang-mills theories in the zero-volume limit. more
recently it was realized that these models describe the short-distance behaviour
of n dirichlet particles [12]. the continuity of the spectrum is then understood
directly in terms of the spectrum of n -particle states. a bold conjecture was
that the super matrix models capture the degrees of freedom of m-theory [13].
in the large-n limit, where one considers the states with an innite number
of particles, the supermembranes should then re-emerge. furthermore there is
new evidence meanwhile that the supermembrane has massless states, which will
presumably correspond to the states of 11-dimensional supergravity, although
proper asymptotic states do not exist. the evidence is based on the matrix
model regularization of the supermembrane [14]. for xed value of n the ex-
istence of such states was foreseen on the basis of identifying the kaluza-klein
states of m-theory compactied on s1 with the dirichlet particles and their
bound states in type-iia string theory.

from this viewpoint it is natural to consider the supermembrane in curved
backgrounds associated with 11-dimensional supergravity and it is the purpose
of this talk to report on progress in this direction. such backgrounds consist of a
nontrivial metric, a three-index gauge eld and a gravitino eld. this provides
us with an action that transforms as a scalar under the combined (local) su-
persymmetry transformations of the background elds and the supermembrane
embedding coordinates. here it is important to realize that the supersymme-
try transformations of the embedding coordinates will themselves depend on
the background. when the background is supersymmetric, then the action will
be supersymmetric as well. in the light-cone formulation this action leads to
models invariant under area-preserving dieomorphisms, which in certain sit-
uations can be approximated by matrix models in curved backgrounds. the
area-preserving dieomorphisms are then replaced by a nite group, such as
u(n ), but target-space dieomorphisms are no longer manifestly realized. ma-
trix models in curved space have already been the subject of independent studies
[15]. also in view of the relation between near-horizon geometries and confor-
mal eld theories [16] interesting classes of backgrounds are the ones where the
target space factorizes locally into the product of an anti-de sitter space and
some compact space. examples of these are the ads4  s7 and ads7  s4
backgrounds that we discuss at the end of the talk.

2 supermembranes

fundamental supermembranes can be described in terms of actions of the green-
schwarz type, possibly in a nontrivial but restricted (super)spacetime back-
ground [1]. such actions exist for supersymmetric p-branes, where p = 0, 1, . . . , d
1 denes the spatial dimension of the brane. thus for p = 0 we have a super-
particle, for p = 1 a superstring, for p = 2 a supermembrane, and so on. the
dimension of spacetime in which the superbrane can live is very restricted. these

2

restrictions arise from the fact that the action contains a wess-zumino-witten
term, whose supersymmetry depends sensitively on the spacetime dimension.
if the coecient of this term takes a particular value then the action possesses
an additional fermionic gauge symmetry, the so-called -symmetry. this sym-
metry is necessary to ensure the matching of (physical) bosonic and fermionic
degrees of freedom. in the following we restrict ourselves to supermembranes
(i.e., p = 2) in 11 dimensions.

the 11-dimensional supermembrane is written in terms of superspace em-
bedding coordinates zm () = (x (), ()), which are functions of the three
world-volume coordinates i (i = 0, 1, 2). it couples to the superspace geome-
a and the
try of 11-dimensional supergravity, encoded by the supervielbein em
antisymmetric tensor gauge supereld bmn p , through the action1

s[z()] = z d3 h pg(z())  1

i = zm /i em

a is the pull-back of the supervielbein to the mem-
where a
brane worldvolume. here the induced metric equals gij = r
j rs, with rs
being the constant lorentz-invariant metric. this action is invariant under local
fermionic -transformations alluded to above, given that certain constraints on
the background elds hold, which are equivalent to the equations of motion of
11-dimensional supergravity [1].

the gamma matrices are denoted by r; gamma matrices with more than one
index denote antisymmetrized products of gamma matrices with unit weight. in
at superspace the supermembrane lagrangian, written in components, reads
(in the notation and conventions of [5]),

l = pg(x, )

(3)

the target space can have compact dimensions which permit winding membrane
states. in at superspace the induced metric,

gij = (ix  + i)(j x  + j)  ,

(4)

is supersymmetric. therefore the rst term in (3) is trivially invariant under
spacetime supersymmetry,

x  =  ,

 =  .

(5)

1our notation and conventions are as follows. tangent-space indices are a = (r, a), whereas
curved indices are denoted by m = (, ). here r,  refer to commuting and a,  to anticom-
muting coordinates. moreover we take 012 = 012 = 1.

3

in 4, 5, 7, or 11 spacetime dimensions the second term in the action proportional
to ijk is also supersymmetric (up to a total divergence) and the full action is
invariant under -symmetry.

let us now consider the supermembrane action for nontrivial backgounds,
such as those induced by a nontrivial target-space metric, a target-space tensor
eld and a target-space gravitino eld, corresponding to the elds of (on-shell)
11-dimensional supergravity. this background can in principle be cast into su-
perspace form by a procedure known as gauge completion. for 11-dimensional
supergravity, the rst steps of this procedure were carried out long ago [17]
and recently [18] the results were determined to second order in the fermionic
coordinates .

to elucidate the generic eects of nontrivial backgrounds for membrane the-
ories, let us conne ourselves for the moment to the purely bosonic theory and
present the light-cone formulation of the membrane in a background consisting
of the metric g and the tensor gauge eld c. in the subsequent sections we
will include the fermionic coordinates. the lagrangian density for the bosonic
membrane follows directly from (1),

l = g  1

6 ijkix  jx  kx  c ,

(6)

where gij = ix  jx   . in the light-cone formulation, the coordinates are
decomposed in the usual fashion as (x +, x , x a) with a = 1 . . . 9. further-
more we use the dieomorphisms in the target space to bring the metric in a
convenient form [19],

g = ga = 0 .

(7)

just as for a at target space, we identify the time coordinate of the target space
with the world-volume time, by imposing the condition x + =  . moreover we
denote the spacesheet coordinates of the membrane by r, r = 1, 2. following
the same steps as for the membrane in at space, one arrives at a hamiltonian
formulation of the theory in terms of coordinates and momenta. these phase-
space variables are subject to a constraint, which takes the same form as for the
membrane theory in at space, namely,

r = pa rx a + p rx   0 .

(8)

of course, the denition of the momenta in terms of the coordinates and their
derivatives does involve the background elds, but at the end all explicit depen-
dence on the background cancels out in the phase-space constraints.

the gauge choice x + =  still allows for  -dependent reparametrizations
of the world-space coordinates r in addition there remains the freedom of
performing tensor gauge transformations of the target-space three-form c. in
order to write the theory as a gauge theory of area-preserving dieomorphisms
it is desirable to obtain a hamiltonian which is polynomial in momenta and
coordinates. obviously one wants the background elds to be independent of
x . with suitable choices for the gauge condition one thus derives [18],

where p c equals a constant times w and cab has been set to a constant

by a choice of gauge. furthermore we made use of the denitions,

ca = rsrx sx b cab + 1
c = 1

2 rsrx asx b cab ,

2 rsrx bsx c cabc ,

c+ = rsrx sx a c+a .

(10)

at this point one can impose further gauge choices and set g+ = 1 and
c+a = 0. taking also cab = 0 the corresponding hamiltonian can be cast in
lagrangian form in terms of a gauge theory of area-preserving dieomorphisms
[20],

2 (d0x a)2 + d0x a(cid:0) 1

2 g++ + 1

(11)

where the derivative is covariant with respect to area-preserving dieomor-
phisms. for convenience we have set (p)0 = 1. in the case of compact dimen-
sions, it may not always be possible to set c+a and cab to zero, although
they can be restricted to constants. one can still follow the same procedure as
above, but the lagrangian then depends explicitly on x , a feature that was
already exhibited earlier for the winding membrane. however, in the case at
hand, the constraint makes the resulting expression for x  extremely nontriv-
ial. the antisymmetric constant matrix cab was conjectured to play a role for
the matrix model compactication on a noncommutative torus [21]. it should
be interesting to see what the role is of (9) in this context.

with a reformulation of the membrane in background elds as a gauge the-
ory of area-preserving dieomorphisms at ones disposal, one may consider its
regularization through a matrix model by truncating the mode expansion for
coordinates and momenta. this leads to a replacement of poisson brackets by
commutators, integrals by traces and products of commuting elds by sym-
metrized products of the corresponding matrices. at that point the original
target-space covariance is aected, as the matrix reparametrizations in terms
of symmetrized products of matrices do not possess a consistent multiplication
structure; this is just one of the underlying diculties in the construction of
matrix models in curved space [15]. with the above results at hand one may
study interactions between membranes by considering the behaviour of a test
membrane in a background eld induced by another membrane [22].

3 superspace backgronds

it is possible to express superspace backgrounds in terms of the component elds
of 11-dimensional supergravity, by means of a technique called gauge completion.

5

we refer to ref. 18 for the details. the superspace geometry with coordinates
zm = (x, ) is encoded in the supervielbein em
a and a spin-connection eld
ab. in what follows we will not pay much attention to the spin-connection,
m
which is not an independent eld. furthermore we have an antisymmetric tensor
gauge eld bmn p , subject to tensor gauge transformations,

bmn p = 3 [m n p ] .

(12)

unless stated otherwise the derivatives with respect to  are always left deriva-
tives.

under superspace dieomorphisms corresponding to zm  zm + m (z),

the super-vielbein and tensor gauge eld transform as

bmn p = qqbmn p + 3 [m qb|q|n p ] .

(14)

(15)

the superspace that we are dealing with is not unrestricted but is subject
to certain constraints and gauge conditions. furthermore, we will not describe
an o-shell situation as all superelds will be expressed entirely in terms of the
r,
three component elds of on-shell 11-dimensional supergravity, the elfbein e
the antisymmetric tensor gauge eld c and the gravitino eld . as a re-
sult of these restrictions the residual symmetry transformations are conned to
11-dimensional dieomorphisms with parameters (x), local lorentz transfor-
mations with parameters rs(x), tensor-gauge transformations with parameters
 (x) and local supersymmetry transformations with parameters (x). to de-
rive how the superelds are parametrized in terms of the component elds it is
necessary to also determine the form of the superspace transformation param-
eters, m , rs and mn , that generate the supersymmetry transformations.
here it is important to realize that we are dealing with a gauge-xed situation.
for that reason the superspace parameters depend on both the x-dependent
component parameters dened above as well as on the component elds. this
has the consequence that local supersymmetry transformations reside in the
superspace dieomorphisms, the lorentz transformations and the tensor gauge
transformations. thus, when considering supersymmetry variations of the var-
ious elds, one must in principle include each of the three possible superspace
transformations.

for further details we refer to ref.18 and we proceed directly to the results.

for completeness we included the 3-term in b which were already known
from the at-superspace results (2).

then we turn to some of the transformation parameters. the supersym-
metry transformations consistent with the elds specied above, are generated
by superspace dieomorphisms, local lorentz transformations and tensor gauge
transformations. we only present the parameters for the superspace dieomor-
phisms here and refer to the literature for more complete results [18],

 encodes unknown terms proportional to f 2.

substituting the above results into the initial supermembrane action (1) we
obtain the action for a supermembrane in a supergravity background to or-
der 2. while the original action was manifestly covariant under independent
superspace dieomorphisms, tangent-space lorentz transformations and tensor
gauge transformations, this is no longer the case and one has to restrict oneself to
the superspace transformations corresponding to the component supersymme-
try, general-coordinate, local lorentz and tensor gauge transformations. when
writing (1) in components, utilizing the expressions found above, one thus ob-
tains an action that is covariant under the restricted superspace dieomorphisms
(18) acting on the superspace coordinates zm = (x , ) (including the space-
time arguments of the background elds) combined with usual transformations
on the component elds. note that the result does not constitute an invariance.
rather it implies that actions corresponding to two dierent sets of background
elds that are equivalent by a component gauge transformation, are the same
modulo a reparametrization of the supermembrane embedding coordinates. in

7

order to be precise let us briey turn to an example and consider the action of
a particle moving in a curved spacetime background with metric g,

s[x , g(x)] = mz dt qg(x(t)) x (t) x (t) .

(19)

this action, which is obviously invariant under world-line dieomorphisms, sat-
ises s[x  , g
(x )] = s[x , g(x)], where x   and x  are related by a
target-space general coordinate transformation which also governs the relation
between g
 and g. of course, when considering a background that is invariant
under (a subset of the) general coordinate transformations (so that g = g), then
the action will be invariant under the corresponding change of the coordinates.
this is the situation that we will address in the next section, where we take a
specic background metric with certain isometries. in that context the relevant
target space for (19) is an anti-de sitter (adsd) space, which has isometries that
constitute the group so(d  1, 2), where d is the spacetime dimension. then
(19) describes a one-dimensional eld theory with an so(d  1, 2) invariance
group. in the particular case of d = 2 this invariance can be re-interpreted as a
conformal invariance for a supersymmetric quantum mechanical system.2

using the previous results one may now write down the complete action
of the supermembrane coupled to background elds up to order 2. direct
substitution leads to the following result for the supervielbein pull-back,

-terms that were determined in previous sections and listed in (17). the rst
formula of (20) and (21) now determine the supermembrane action (1) up to
order 3. it has been shown that the resulting expressions are consistent with
supersymmetry and -invariance [18].

4 near-horizon geometries

in the previous section we discussed the determination of superspace quantities,
i.e. the superspace vielbein and the tensor gauge eld, in terms of the elds of 11-
dimensional on-shell supergravity. the corresponding expressions are obtained
by iteration order-by-order in  coordinates, but except for the leading terms it
is hard to proceed with this program. nevertheless these results enable one to
write down the 11-dimensional supermembrane action coupled to a nontrivial
supergravity component-eld background to second order in , so that one can
start a study of the supermembrane degrees of freedom in the corresponding
background geometries.

however, in specic backgrounds with a certain amount of symmetry, it is
possible to obtain results to all orders in . interesting candidates for such back-
grounds are the membrane [24] and the ve-brane solution [25] of 11-dimensional
supergravity, as well as solutions corresponding to the product of anti-de sitter
spacetimes with compact manifolds. coupling to the latter solutions, which ap-
pear near the horizon of black d-branes [26], seem especially appealing in view
of the recent results on a connection between large-n superconformal eld the-
ories and supergravity on a product of an ads space with a compact manifold
[16]. the target-space geometry induced by the p-branes interpolates between
adsp+2 b near the horizon, where b denotes some compact manifold (usually
a sphere), and at (p + 1)-dimensional minkowski space times a cone with base
b.

this program has been carried out recently for the type-iib superstring
and the d3-brane in a iib-supergravity background of this type [27, 28, 29].
in the context of 11-dimensional supergravity the ads4  s7 and ads7  s4
backgrounds stand out as they leave all 32 supersymmetries invariant [30, 31].
these backgrounds are associated with the near-horizon geometries correspond-
ing to two- and ve-brane congurations and thus to possible conformal eld
theories in 3 and 6 spacetime dimensions with 16 supersymmetries, whose exact
nature is not yet completely known. in this section we consider the superme-
mbrane in these two backgrounds [32]. as the corresponding spaces are local
products of homogeneous spaces, their geometric information can be extracted
from appropriate coset representatives leading to standard invariant one-forms
corresponding to the vielbeine and spin-connections. the approach of ref. 32
diers from that of ref. 33; in the latter one constructs the geometric informa-
tion exploiting simultaneously the -symmetry of the supermembrane action,
while in ref. 32 the geometric information is determined independently from
the supermembrane action. the results for the geometry coincide with those of
ref. 34.

9

as is well known, the compactications of the theory to ads4  s7 and
ads7  s4 are induced by the antisymmetric 4-rank eld strength of m-theory.
these two compactications are thus governed by the freund-rubin eld f ,
dened by (in pauli-kallen convention, so that we can leave the precise signature
of the spacetime open),

f = 6f e  ,

(22)

with e the vierbein determinant. when f is purely imaginary we are dealing with
an ads4s7 background while for real f we have an ads7s4 background. the
nonvanishing curvature components corresponding to the 4- and 7-dimensional
subspaces are equal to

r = 4f 2(g g  g g) ,
r  = f 2(g g   g g  ) .

(23)

here , , ,  and , , ,  are 4- and 7-dimensional world indices, respec-
tively. we also use m4,7 for the inverse radii of the two subspaces, dened
by |f|2 = m7
2. the killing-spinor equations associated with the 32
supersymmetries in this background take the form

2 = 1

(cid:16)d  f 5  1(cid:17) = (cid:16)d + 1

2 f 1  

(cid:17) = 0 ,

(24)

where we make use of the familiar decomposition of the (hermitean) gamma
matrices  and 
 , appropriate to the product space of a 4- and a 7-dimensional
subspace. here d and d denote the covariant derivatives containing the
spin-connection elds corresponding to so(3,1) or so(4) and so(7) or so(6,1),
respectively.

the algebra of isometries of the ads4  s7 and ads7  s4 backgrounds is
given by osp(8|4; r) and osp(6, 2|4). their bosonic subalgebra consists of so(8)
sp(4)  so(8)  so(3, 2) and so(6, 2)  usp(4)  so(6, 2)  so(5), respectively.
the spinors transform in the (8, 4) of this algebra.
one may decompose the generators of osp(8|4) or osp(6, 2|4) in terms of
irreducible representations of the bosonic so(7)  so(3, 1) and so(6, 1)  so(4)
subalgebras. in that way one obtains the bosonic (even) generators pr, mrs,
which generate so(3, 2) or so(5), and pr , mrs , which generate so(8) or so(6, 2).
all the bosonic generators are taken antihermitean (in the pauli-kallen sense).
the fermionic (odd) generators qaa are majorana spinors, where we denote the
spinorial tangent-space indices by a, b, . . . and a, b, . . . for 4- or 7-dimensional
indices. the commutation relations between even generators are

[pr, ps] = 4f 2mrs ,
[pr, mst] = rs pt  rt ps ,
[mrs, mtu] = ru mst + st mru

[pr , ps ] = f 2mrs ,

[pr, mst ] = rs pt  rt ps ,

[mrs , mtu ] = ru mst + st mru

(25)

10

the odd-even commutators are given by

[pr, qaa ] = f (r5)a
[mrs, qaa ] =  1
2 (rs)a
finally, we have the odd-odd anti-commutators,

b qba ,
b qba ,

[pr , qaa] =  1
[mrs , qaa] =  1

all other (anti)commutators vanish. the normalizations of the above algebra
were determined by comparison with the supersymmetry algebra in the conven-
tions of [18] in the appropriate backgrounds.

however, one can return to 11-dimensional notation and drop the distinc-
tion between 4- and 7-dimensional indices so that the equations obtain a more
compact form. in that case the above (anti)commutation relations that involve
the supercharges can be concisely written as,

only make use of (28).

5 coset-space representatives of ads4  s7 and

ads7  s4

both backgrounds that we consider correspond to homogenous spaces and can
thus be formulated as coset spaces. in the case at hand these (reductive) coset
spaces g/h are osp(8|4; r)/so(7)  so(3, 1) and osp(6, 2|4)/so(6, 1) 
so(4). to each element of the coset g/h one associates an element of g,
which we denote by l(z). here z a stands for the coset-space coordinates xr,
a (or, alternatively, xr, yr
). the coset representative l transforms
from the left under constant g-transformations corresponding to the isometry
group of the coset space and from the right under local h-transformations:
l  l = g l h1.

where we suppressed the spinor indices on the anticommuting component ea.
the rst equation in a fermion-free background reproduces (23) upon using the
commutation relations (25).

now the question is how to determine the vielbeine and connections to all
orders in  for the spaces of interest. first, observe that the choice of the coset
representative amounts to a gauge choice that xes the parametrization of the
coset space. we will not insist on an explicit parametrization of the bosonic part
of the space. it turns out to be advantageous to factorize l(z) into a group
element of the bosonic part of g corresponding to the bosonic coset space,
whose parametrization we leave unspecied, and a fermion factor. hence one
may write

l(z) = (x) l() ,

with l() = exp[ q ] .

(33)

there exists a convenient trick [27, 28, 35] according to which one rst rescales
the odd coordinates according to   t , where t is an auxiliary parameter that
we will put to unity at the end. taking the derivative with respect to t of (30)
then leads to a rst-order dierential equation for e and  (in 11-dimensional
notation),

e   = d q + (e  ) q  q (e  )

(34)

after expanding e and  on the right-hand side in terms of the generators and
using the (anti)commutation relations (28) we nd a set of coupled rst-order
linear dierential equations,

3a one-form v stands for v  dz ava and an exterior derivative acts according to dv 

dz b  dz a avb . fermionic derivatives are thus always left-derivatives.

(39)

which agree completely with those given in section 8 (and, for the spin-connection
eld, in ref. 17).

this information can now be substituted into the rst part of the super-
membrane action (1). by similar techniques one can also determine the wess-
zumino-witten part of the action by rst considering the most general ansatz
for a four-form invariant under tangent-space transformations. using the lowest-
order expansions of the vielbeine (39) and comparing with ref. 18 shows that
only two terms can be present. their relative coecient is xed by requiring
that the four-form is closed, something that can be veried by making use of
the maurer-cartan equations (32). the result takes the form

f(4) =

1

4!her  es  et  eufrstu  12 e  rse  er  esi .

(40)

to establish this result we also needed the well-known quartic-spinor identity in
11 dimensions. the overall factor in (40) is xed by comparing to the normal-
ization of the results given in ref. 18.

because f(4) is closed, it can be written locally as f(4) = db. the general
solution for b can be found by again exploiting the one-forms with rescaled 

13

coordinates according to   t  and deriving a dierential equation. using the
lowest order result for b this equation can be solved and yields

b = 1

6 er  es  et crst z 1

0

dt  rse  er  es ,

(41)

where the vielbein components contain the rescaled s. this answer immedi-
ately reproduces the at-space result upon substitution of frstu = rs = 0.

in order to obtain the supermembrane action one substitutes the above ex-
pressions in the action (1). the resulting action is then invariant under local
fermionic -transformations as well as under the superspace isometries corre-
sponding to osp(8|4) or osp(6, 2|4).
we have already emphasized that the choice of the coset representative
amounts to adopting a certain gauge choice in superspace. the choice that
was made in ref. 32 connects directly to the generic 11-dimensional superspace
results, written in a wess-zumino-type gauge, in which there is no distinction
between spinorial world and tangent-space indices.
in specic backgrounds,
such as the ones discussed here, gauge choices are possible which allow further
simplications. for this we refer to refs. 28 and 36.

the results of this section provide a convincing check of the low-order  re-
sults obtained by gauge completion for general backgrounds [18, 17]. a great
amount of clarity was gained by expressing our results in 11-dimensional lan-
guage, so that both the ads4  s7 and the ads7  s4 solution could be covered
in one go. note that in both these backgrounds the gravitino vanishes.
we have no reasons to expect that the 11-dimensional form of our results
will coincide with the expressions for a generic 11-dimensional superspace (with
the gravitino set to zero) at arbitrary orders in .

from a more technical viewpoint it is gratifying that explicit constructions
of supermembranes in certain nontrivial backgrounds are now possible. the
complete m-theory two-brane action in ads4  s7 and ads7  s4 to all orders
in  represents a further step in the program of nding the complete anti-de-
sitter background actions for the superstring [27, 28] and the m2-, d3- [29] and
m5-branes initiated for the bosonic part in ref. 23. furthermore, by studying
the interaction between a test membrane in the background of an m2- or an
m5-brane, one may hope to learn more about the interactions between branes.
some of these issues have already been considered recently [22].
