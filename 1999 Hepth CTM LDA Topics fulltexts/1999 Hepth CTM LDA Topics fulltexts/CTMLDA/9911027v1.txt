abstract

the future tube t +

n of n-dimensional minkowski spacetime may be
identied with the reduced phase space p , or space of motions  of a
particle moving in (n + 1)-dimensional anti-de-sitter spacetime. both
are isomorphic to a homogeneous bounded domain in cn whose shilov
boundary may be identied with n-dimensional conformally compactied
minkowski spacetime.

introduction

the purpose of this talk is to describe some remarkable geometric facts relating
the future tube t +
n of n-dimensional minkowski spacetime to the reduced phase
space p , or space of motions  of a particle moving in (n+1)-dimensional anti-
de-sitter spacetime with a view to illuminating the maldacena conjectures [1]
relating string theory on adsn+1 to conformal field theory on its conformal
boundary.

2 the future tube

slightly confusingly perhaps, the future tube t +
n is usually dened as those
points of complexied minkowski spacetime en1,1
, with complex coordinates
z = x + iy, such that y lie inside the past light cone c
n . that is y0 <
pyiyi. with this convention together with standard conventions of quantum

eld theory, a positive frequency function is the boundary value of a function
which is holomorphic in the future tube. the relation between a holomorphic
function, for example one dened in some bounded domain d  cn, and the
values of that function on its shilov boundary s, which is an n real dimensional
submanifold of the (2n  1) real dimensional boundary d may be said to be
holographic in that the information about two real valued functions of 2n
real variables is captured by two real valued functions of n real variables. this
is the key idea behind the application of dispersion relations to quantum eld
theory and their use to derive rigourous general results such as the spin-statistics
theorem and invariance under cpt.

3 bounded complex domains

homogeneous bounded domains were classied by cartan [5] and their proper-
ties are described in detail by hua [6]. the case we are interested in corresponds
to the hermitian symmetric space d = so(n, 2)/(so(2)so(n)). it is referred
to by hua [6] as lie sphere space . in order to see this, consider the complex
light cone c n+2

c  cn+2 given by

c

c

c

(1)

= c n+2

(w n+1)2 + (w n+2)2  (w i)2 = 0.
compactied complexied minkowski spacetime en1,1
consists of complex
light rays passing through the origin. this means that one must identify rays
w a and w a, where a = 1, . . . , n + 2, i = 1, . . . , n and   c  c \ 0, that
is en1,1
c /c. evidently so(n  1, 2; r) acting in the obvious way on
cn+1 leaves the complex lightcone c n+2
invariant and commutes with the c
action. thus the action of so(n  1, 2; r) descends to d. if we restrict the co-
ordinates w a to be real, we obtain the standard construction of n-dimensional
compactied real minkowski spacetime en1,1, as light rays through the ori-
gin of en1,2. it follows that en1,1  (s1  sn1)/z2, the nite points in
minkowski spacetime, i.e. those not contained in what penrose refers to as i
may be obtained by intersecting the light cone with a null hyperplane which
does not pass through the origin.

to get to the description given by hua [6], introduce coordinates parame-

terising (most of) the light cone by u, wi by

and

w n+1  iw n+2 =

1
u

,

w n+1 + iw n+2 =

wiwi

u

,

w i =

wi
u

,

(4)

if w  cn is a complex (n  1) column vector and w2 = wtw and |w|2 = ww
then the domain d dened by [6]

the topological boundary is given by the real equation:

1  |w|2  p|w|4  |w2|2.

1  2|w|2 + |w2|2 = 0.

(5)

(6)

on the other hand, the shilov boundary s  d is determined by the property
that the maximum modulus of any holomorphic function on p is attained on
s. consider, for example, the holomorphic function w. it attains its maximum
modulus when w = exp(i )n, where n is a real unit (n  1) vector. thus s
is given by s1  sn1/z2. if we take w i to be the real unit n-vector n and
u = exp(i ) we see that s and en1,1 are one and the same thing.

4 the geodesic flow of adsn+1

now let us turn to (n + 1)-dimensional anti-de-sitter spacetime . one possible
approach to quantising a relativistic particle moving in adsn+1n, might be to
look at the relativistic phase space and then pass to the constrained space and to
quantise it. recall that, in general, the relativistic phase space of a spacetime
m is the cotangent bundle t m with coordinates {x, p}, canonical one-form
a = pdx and symplectic form

the geodesic ow is generated by the covariant hamiltonian

 = dp  dx.

h =

1
2

g pp.

(7)

(8)

the ow for a timelike geodesic, corresponding to a particle of mass m lies on
the level sets, call them , given by

h = 

1
2

m2.

(9)

the restriction of the canonical one-form a to the level sets  endows them
with a contact structure, in other words, the restriction of da has rank 2n
and its one-dimensional kernel is directed along the geodesic ow. thus, lo-
cally at least, one may pass to the reduced phase space p = /g1 where g1
is the one-parameter group generated by the covariant hamiltonian h, by a
marsden-weinstein reduction. geometrically, the group g1 takes points and
their cotangent vectors along the world lines of the timelike geodesics.

the reduced 2n-dimensional phase space p is naturally a symplectic man-
ifold. moreover the isometries of m act by canonical transformations, i.e. by

3

a (x) on m determines a moment map a(x, p) = k 

symplectomorphisms, on p taking timelike geodesics to timelike geodesics. each
killing vector eld k 
a p
on t m which poisson commutes with the covariant hamiltonian h. they thus
descend to reduced phase space p where their poisson algebra is is the same
as the lie algebra of of the isometry group. thus, for example, if n = 2 the
poisson algebra is sl(2; r). this fact is behind the connection between black
holes, conformal mechanics, and calogero models discussed in [15].

we are interested in the quantum theory rather than the classical geodesic
motion and so it is appealing to attempt to implement the geometric quantiza-
tion programme by quantising  p . a point of particular interest would then
be to compare it with a more conventional approach based on quantum eld
theory in a xed background. in the general case this appears to be dicult be-
cause one does not have a good understanding of the space of timelike geodesics
p . however in the present case of adsn+1, the space p may be described rather
explicitly. it is a homogeneous kahler manifold which is isomorphic to the fu-
ture tube t +
n of n-dimensional minkowski spacetime. because it is a kahler
manifold one may adopt a holomorphic polarisation. the resulting quantiza-
tion is the same as that considered by berezin and others many years ago (see
e.g. [11, 12, 13]). a more physical description is in terms of coherent states.

to see the relation between p and t +

n explicitly it is convenient to regard

adsn+1 as the real quadric in en,2 given by

(w n+1)2 + (w n+2)2  (w i)2 = 1.

(10)

it is clear by comparing (1) and (10) that the light cone cn+2 and the quadric
adsn+1 can only touch at innity, which explains why the conformal boundary
of adsn+1/z2 is the same as compactied minkowski spacetime en1,1  (s1
sn1)/z2, where z2 is the antipodal map z2 : wa  wa.
using this representation of adsn+1 , one easily sees that every timelike
geodesic is equivalent to every other one under an so(n  1, 2) transformation.
they may all be obtained as the intersection of some totally timelike 2-plane
passing through the origin of of the embedding space en,2 with the adsn+1
quadric. the space p of such two planes may thus be identifed with the space
of geodesics. it is a homogeneous space of the isometry group, in fact the grass-
mannian so(n, 2)/(so(2)  so(n)). note that, as one expects, the dimension
of p is 2n. the denominator of the coset is the maximal compact subgroup of
so(n, 2). two factors correspond to timelike rotations in the timelike 2-plane
and rotations of the normal space respectively. the former may be identied
with the one parameter group g1 generated by the covariant hamiltonian h.
thus the level set  is the coset space so(n, 2)/so(n).

5 quantisation

given a manifold x with coordinates x and a measure , an over complete set
of coherent states is a set of vectors {|xi} in some quantum mechanical hilbert
space hqm providing a resolution of the identity

zx

|xihx| = 1.

(11)

usually one takes x to be a homogeneous space of some lie group. however
that is not essential for the general concept. a hermitian operator a on hqm
is associated with a real function a(x) via the relation

a = zx

a(x)|xihx| = 1.

(12)

the commutator algebra of a set of operators on hqm then gives rise to an
algebra a on the associated functions. if x is a symplectic manifold one expects,
at least in the limit that plancks constant is small, or more strictly speaking
in the limit of large action, that the algebra a reects the poisson algebra on
the functions on x. for the special case of non-compact kahler manifold of
dimension 2n, kahler form  and with coordinates wi and metric

gij =

2f
wiwj .

(13)

where f is the kahler potential it was proposed by berezin [11, 12, 13] that one
choose for hqm the space of holomorphic functions with inner product

hg(w)|f (w)i = zx

g(w)f (z)

n
n!

exp(

1
h

f )

(14)

one must now choose h so that one gets a non-trivial hilbert space hqm. given
that one may proceed to represent the isometries of x on hqm and to introduce
other operators and investigate their algebras. note that the metric on hqm
will in general depend upon h. the quantity h is referred to in this context
as plancks constant, although physically, for dimensional reasons, that is not
really accurate. if it happens that x is einstein kahler with negative scalar
curvature then the monge amp`ere equation tells us that

detgij = exp(f )

(15)

thus, to get convergence one wants h  1
|| . an upper bound for plancks
constant seems very puzzling from a physical point of view but it has a simple
explanation.

consider the circle bundle s1  e  x over the kahler manifold x with
a connection whose curvature f = da is a multiple, e, of the symplectic form

5

. thus f = e and one may think of e as the product of the electric charge
and the strength of magnetic eld. the covariant derivative is d =  + ewf .
thus if  = eef f (w), where f (w) is holomorphic, then

d = 0.

(16)



now the space of spinors on a kahler manifold may be identied with the
space of dierential forms of type (0,p). the dirac operator corresponds to
the operator 2( + 
). minimally coupling the dirac operator to the kahler
connection corresponds geometrically to taking the tensor product of the space
of spinors with a power of the canonical bundle. the rst power gives the
canonical spinc structure on x.
if x is assumed to have trivial second co-
homology we may take any (not even rational power). the dirac operator
minimally coupled to f corresponds to 2(d + d
). it follows that by setting
2e =  1
h we may identify hqm with the space of zero modes of the minimally
coupled dirac operator on x. now typically x has negative curvature, and so
only if the charge on the spinors is suciently large, and of the correct sign, will
there be a big space of, or indeed any, zero modes.



the above theory was rather general. we now restrict to the case of a
bounded complex domain d in cn. we begin by describing its kahler structure.
associated with d is the hilbert space hol(d) of square integrable holomorphic
functions. if {s}, s = 1, . . . , is an orthonormal basis for hol(d) the bergman
kernel k(w, v) is dened by

k(w, v) = x s(w)s(v).

(17)

the bergman kernel gives rise to a kahler potential f (w, w) = log k(w, w) in
terms of which the bergman metric on d is given by

gij =

2f
wiwj .

(18)

geometrically the basis {s} gives a map of d into cp and gij is the pull-
back of the fubini-study metric. now although d has nite euclidean volume,
because k and f typically diverge at the boundary d the volume of d with
respect to the kahler metric gij diverges. for example, in our case hua [6] has
calculated k(w, w) and nds

k(w, w) =

1
vn

1

(1 + |w2|2  2|w|2)n ,

(19)

where vn = n

2n1n! is the euclidean volume of d.

6 cheng-mok-yau-anti-de-sitter spacetimes

the theory described above does not take into account gravity. of course su-
pergravity methods provide a way of doing that. they would lead to replacing
adsn by some other solution of the supergravity equations of motion. for exam-
ple with some other einstein space. a great deal of work has already appeared
going in this direction. one new possibility will be described in this section.

however it is also worth asking how the space p might be generalised. the
relationship between these two generalisations is then of interest. this will be
dercibed in the next section.

if n is odd, n = 2m+1 say, then ads2m+1 may be regarded as a circle bundle
c [4]. clearly, using complex coordinates z a,

over complex hyperbolic space h m
a = 1, . . . , m + 1 in r2m+2  cm+1, ads2m+1 is given by

|z 1|2  . . .  |z m+1|2 = 1.

(20)
we may now bre by the u (1) action z a  eitz a. the orbits are closed
timelike curves in ads2m+1. the base space b has a riemannian, i.e. positive
c is the unit ball in cm.
denite, metric. in fact b = su (m, 1)/u (m)  h m
this is another bounded complex domain in cm. the metric on the base space
is precisely its bergman metric. in fact h m
c with its bergman metric is ithe
symmetric space dual of cpm with its fubini-study metric. the construction
we have just described is the symmetric space dual of the usual hopf bration.

the metric is

ds2 = (dt + aadxb)2 + gabdxadxb

(21)

where a, b = 1, 2, . . . , 2m, gab is the einstein-kahler metric and da is the
kahler form.
in traditional relativists language, ads2m+1 has been exhib-
ited as an ultra-stationary metric (i.e. one with constant newtonian potential
u = 1
2 log(g00). the sagnac or gravito-magnetic connection, governing frame-
dragging eects corresponds precisely to the connection of the standard circle
bundle over the kahler base space. its curvature is the kahler form.

now it is easy to check that one may replace the bergman manifold {b, gab}
with any other 2m dimensional einstein-kahler manifold with negative scalar
curvature and obtain a (2m + 1)-dimensional lorentzian einstein manifolds
admitting killing spinors in this way. according to cheng and yau [17] and
mok and yau [16], there is a rich supply of complete einstein kahler metrics
on complex domains. their investigation might well prove to be fruitful. the
conformal boundary of these spacetimes is clearly related to the boundary of
the complex domain, but the precise relationship is not at all clear. apart from
their possible applications to the maldecena conjecture, these spacetimes may
provide a useful arena, albeit in higher dimensions, for investigating the eects
of closed timelike curves in general relativity.

7 adapted complex structures

we have seen that the space p of timelike geodesics in adsn carries an einstein
kahler structure. in fact the entire cotangent bundle t adsn admits a ricci-
at pseudo kahler metric, i.e. one with signature (2n  2, 2). the existence of
this ricci-at pseudo-kahler metric may be obtained by analytically continuing
stenzelss [18] positive denite ricci-at kahler metric on the cotangent bundle
of the standard n-sphere, t sn [18]. the simplest case is when n = 2. stenzels
metric is then the eguchi-hanson metric which may be analytically continued
to give a kleinian metric of signature (2, 1) on t ads2. in fact the cotangent
bundle of any riemannian manifold may be endowed with a canonical complex
structure and a variety of kahler metrics. we will describe this construction
shortly and formulate a version for lorentzian manifolds. before doing so we
descibe stenzels construction.

the cotangent bundle of the n-sphere t sn may be identied with an ane
quadric in cn+1. this may be seen as follows: t sn consist of a pair of real
(n + 1) vectors x a and p a such that

x 1x 1 + x 2x 2 + . . . + x n+1x n+1 = 1,

(22)

x 1p 1 + x 2p 2 + . . . + x n+1p n+1 = 0.

(23)
if p = p 1p 1 + p 2p 2 + . . . + p n+1p n+1 one may map t sn into the ane
quadric

setting

(z 1)2 + (z 2)2 + . . . + (z n+1)2 = 1

z a = aa + iba = cosh(p )x a + i

sinh(p )

p

p a.

(24)

(25)

stenzel then seeks a kahler potential depending only on the restriction to

the quadric (24) of the function

 = |z 1|2 + |z 2|2 + . . . + |z n+1|2.

(26)

the monge-amp`ere equation now reduces to any ordinary dierential equation.
in the case of adsp+2 we may proceed as follows. the bundle of future
directed timelike vectors in adsp+2, t +adsp+2 consists of pairs of timelike
vectors x a, p a in ep+1,2 such that

x ax bab = 1

(27)

and

(28)
with p a future directed and ab = diag(1,1, +1, . . . , +1) the metric. we
dene p = pp ap bab and

x ap bab = 0,

p a

(29)

z a = cosh(p )x a + i

8

sinh(p )

p

which maps t +adsp+2 to the ane quadric

z az bab = 1.

(30)

one then seeks a kahler potential depending only on the restriction to the

quadric (24) of the function

 = |z 0|2 + |z p+2|2  |z 1|2  . . .  |z p+1|2.

(31)

dx

the monge-amp`ere equation again reduces to an ordinary dierential equation.
the canonical complex structure on t m is dened as follows. let  
(cid:0)x(), p = g
d ()(cid:1) be a solution of hamiltons equations for a geodesic
in t m . then in any complex chart wi, i = 1, . . . , n one demands that for
all geodesics the map c  t m given by  + i  (cid:0)x(),  p(cid:1) is holomor-
phic. the energy  h = 1
2 gpp is a real valued positive function on t m
which vanishes only on m . it is plurisubharmonic with respect to the complex
structure i.e. the hermitian metric

2h
wiwj

(32)

is positive denite, and h satises the homogeneous monge-amp`ere equation

2h
wiwj(cid:1) = 0.

det(cid:0)

(33)

in the case of stenzels construction one has h = 1

2 p 2 = 1

8 (cosh1( ))2.

8 the physical dimension

the analysis above works for general dimension. however the case n = 4 is
special since so(4, 2)  su (2, 2)/z2. one may identify points in real four-
dimensional minkowski spacetime e3,1 with two by two hermitian matrices
z = x0 + x  . the future tube t +
then corresponds to complex matrices
x = z0 + z   whose imaginary part is positive denite. the cayley map

4

z  w = (z  i)(z + i)1

(34)

maps this into the bounded holomorphic domain in c4 consisting of the space
of two by two complex matrices w satisfying

1  ww > 0.

(35)

for more details the reader is directed to [7]. for this approach to the

compactication of minkowski spacetime see also [8, 9]

9 de-sitter

the aim of the talk has been to describe some intriguing relations between the
future tube and the covariant phase space of anti-de-sitter spacetime which
seem to lie at the heart of holography. one may ask: what about de-sitter
spacetime? as one might expect, everything goes wrong. one problem is that
one does not get a positive denite metric on covariant phase space. this makes
for diculties in the usual approach to geometric quantisation. thie lack of a
positive metric is more or less clear because the timelike geodesics are orbits of
the non-compact group so(1, 1). this last fact is also closely related to thermal
radiation seen by geodesics observers in de-sitter spacetime. a closely related
problem concerns the lack of a positive energy generator of so(n, 1) and the
consequent impossibility of de-sitter supersymmetry.

10 final remarks

after the talk i became aware of [24] where a geometric quantisation approach to
anti-de-sitter spacetime is described. i was also told of some work in axiomatic
quantum eld theory [25] [26] which appears to have some relation to what i
have desribed above.

11 acknowledgement

i should like to thank the organizers for the opportunity to speak at such a
stimuating conference.
