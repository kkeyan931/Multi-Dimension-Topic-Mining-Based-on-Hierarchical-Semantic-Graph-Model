abstract

ads/cft-correspondence establishes a relationship between supersymmetric
gravity (sugra) on anti-de-sitter (ads) space and supersymmetric yang-mills
(sym) theory which is conformaly invariant (cft). the ads space is the solution
of the einstein-hilbert equations with a constant negative curvature. why is this re-
lationship important? what kind of relationship is this? how does one nd it? the
purpose of this text is to answer these questions. we try to present the main ideas
and arguments underlying this relationship, starting with a brief sketch of old string
theory statements and proceeding with the denition of d-branes and a description
of their main features. we nish with the observation of the correspondence in
question and the arguments that favor it.

1 introduction

a long standing problem is to nd a string description of yang-mills (ym) theory [1]. the
argument goes as follows: in the mathematical description of any phenomenon one needs
to nd some exactly solvable approximation to it and some small parameter which one
can expand over in order to approach the real situation. in the case of ym theory such
a good approximation at large energies is in terms of free vector particles. they carry
quantum numbers taking values in the adjoint representation of a non-abelian gauge
group and the small parameter in question is the coupling constant g2 [1]. however, there
is a problem in this description because quantum eects cause the coupling constant to
grow as one approaches large distances or small energies. furthermore, at some distance
scale the description in terms of the fundamental ym variables becomes invalid due to
singularities in the perturbative theory [1]. as a result, nobody knows how to pass to low
energies in ym theory. thus the question appears: what is the approximation to ym
theory which can be applicable in both regimes (high and low energies)?

the most promising approach to this problem is to consider su(n) ym theory as
n   [1]. in this limit the ym perturbation series drastically simplies [2] and the
only graphs which survive look like triangulations of sphere. this is one of the hints
[1] that there could be a string description of ym theory in this limit, which would be
a two-dimensional theory representing these triangulations. furthermore graphs which
contribute to the triangulations represent a series expansion in powers of g2n (which
is taken nite as n  ) rather than simply in powers of the ym coupling constant
g2 [2], while at the same time the torus and all graphs having topologies of spheres with
more than one handle are suppressed by powers of 1/n 2. thus 1/n 2 would be the small
parameter in expansion over which one could approach the real situation.

why should we prefer the description in terms of string theory? the point is that
string theory has a very well developed and powerful apparatus for calculating amplitudes
of various processes [1, 3, 4] and, moreover, one could hope to solve it.

in the case of ordinary ym no one has yet succeeded in nding such a string descrip-
tion, but in conformaly invariant supersymmetric ym (sym) theories there has recently
been a considerable progress [5, 6, 7, 8]. it is worth mentioning that the string description
of conformal ym theories is of pure academic interest since due to conformal invariance
we know dynamics of these theories at all distances, however one might hope that such a
string description would reveal some features of string theory for the ordinary ym.

there are several non-anomalous and self-consistent string theories which satisfy su-
persymmetry (susy) in target space  the space where the string evolves. the target
space should be ten-dimensional, since otherwise there is no well developed apparatus of
calculation of superstring amplitudes [1, 3, 4]. at the same time, string world-sheets are
two-dimensional universes swept out by strings during their time evolution. there are
innitely many ways to excite the world-sheet theory to give dierent quantum states of
the string. each of them looks like a particle living in the target space. among these
particles there are a nite number of massless ones, while all other particles have masses of
the order of the string tension, which is usually taken to be very big. hence, at distances
bigger than the string characteristic one (exactly when the strings look as point-like ob-
jects) only the massless particles survive, and the latter are described by a eld theory in
the target space rather than string theory.

among the massless closed string excitations there is a symmetric tensor particle,

3

which, due to the symmetry properties of string theory, has exactly the same number of
degrees of freedom as the graviton. the only large scale theory (that which contains the
lowest powers of derivatives of the elds) which could describe the graviton is einstein-
hilbert gravity in the target space. as can be rigorously shown [1, 3, 4] it is this theory
(interacting with the other massless string excitations) that follows from string theory at
large distances. at the same time in the case of superstring theory one obtains sugra
at large distances.

it is also possible to obtain sym interacting with sugra if one includes open strings
in the theory along with closed ones. this is because the massless excitation of open
string theory is a vector particle with the proper number of physical polarizations to be
a gauge boson.

bearing this in mind, one could say that there is a string theory for four-dimensional
sym. in the situation under consideration, superstring theory gives a regularization of
sym theory.
in fact, superstring theory is nite and valid at any distances, while at
large distances it leads to a theory containing sym. but this is unsatisfactory because
at the string characteristic scale when we get such a superstring description of sym we
also have to deal with quantum gravity and the dimensionality of space-time is ten rather
than four.

fortunately new ways have recently been discovered to add open string sectors to the
closed ones. they lead to new ways of coupling sym to sugra. to nd them one has to
add a stack of n d-branes to closed string theory in such a way that it respects susy. the
d-branes are multi-dimensional sub-manifolds of the target space on which open strings
terminate [9], while closed strings can still live in the bulk of target space. hence, in the
world-volume of a stack of n d-branes at low energies one sees u(n) sym theory [10],
while in the bulk there is standard sugra.

thus, strings which could describe sym theory are attached to our four-dimensional
world (d3-brane world-volume) while uctuating in the bulk of target space [9, 5]. to
specify the string description one has to nd the geometry in which the strings uctuate,
and to do this one must probe the d3-brane from the outside:
from the bulk. at the
same time, the theory as seen by an observer when traveling further and further from
the d-brane could change uncontrollably, for we do not know the full dynamics of string
theory. to overcome this diculty one has to force the d-branes to respect some part of
the susy transformations of superstring theory. let us explain why.

in quantum eld theory and statistical mechanics when one goes from small to large
distances, it is necessary to average over all uctuations in the theory with wave-lengths
smaller than the distance scale in question. this could lead to a change of parameters
in the theory. for example, if one places a charged source into a plasma it is screened,
because opposite charges to the source are attracted, while the same are repelled. it is
the simplicity of the system which allows us to predict how the charge of a source will
vary as one approaches it. however, in ym theory the situation is more complicated. in
fact, how the charge of the theory varies with respect to the distance is known only up to
some low energy scale. as a result, a proper low energy description of strong interactions
is still unknown. similar things could happen in any non-linear theory, such as gravity or
string theory.

the dierence in the presence of susy is that bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom
can be exchanged in the theory [12]. it is this symmetry which causes the cancellation
between screening and anti-screening due to fermions and bosons. the latter happens

4

only if a source respects some part of susy transformations, i.e. that it is a bogomolni-
prassad-sommerfeld (bps) state [4, 11, 12]. while not rigorous, we hope that the reader
has at least gotten the avor of how it works.

thus, the presence of susy helps one to nd how geometry is curved in the d-brane
background. for example, the characteristic curvature of the d3-brane is proportional to
(g2n)1/4 in the units of string tension.

let us now explain the new ideas d-branes can give in seeking for string description
of ym theory in contrast to old string theory. first, in this case one could deal directly
with four-dimensional sym theory. second, one can vary the regularization energy scale
for ym theory living on a d-brane world-volume and make it much smaller than the string
one [5]. this works as follows: after a regularization we have suppressed the information
about high frequency modes and the high energy theory underlying the one in question
should contain this information. what happens in the d-brane case is that high enough
frequency modes of the elds living on the d-brane world-volume could escape to the bulk
of the target space: they could create closed strings living in the bulk [13]. however,
closed strings with energies smaller than the brane curvature can not escape to innity
[14] but instead they stay in the throat region  the strongly curved part of the bulk in
the vicinity of the d-brane, because they do not have enough energy to climb over the
gravitational potential and escape to the at asymptotic region.

in conclusion, we only need the theory in the throat in order to respect unitarity
[5, 6, 15]. thus, if the limit n   and g  0 is taken in such a way that g2n  1
we have the full string theory in the throat regularizing the sym on the d-brane world-
volume [6] because this is the limit when the size of the d-brane throat is very small and
only string theory could be applicable. however, if limits n   and g  0 are taken so
that g2n  1 we could apply classical gravity. in fact, the size of the throat is very big in
this situation. we mean that in this limit the string theory for sym is described by the
classical superstring in the throat background, i.e. there is the string description of sym
before gravity becomes quantized. now in the simplest situation sym on the brane has
n = 4 supersymmetries, hence its -function is zero and it is conformaly invariant. in
the corresponding gravity description the geometry of the throat of the brane in question
is ads.

the paper is organized as follows: for self-consistency we include two chapters devoted
to string theory. in the rst chapter we try to present the main ideas of string theory
using the example of bosonic string theory, then in the second chapter we proceed with
the denition of type ii superstring theories and review their massless spectrum. after
presenting superstring theory, we introduce the notion of d-branes in the third chapter
and show their relation to gravity solitons and to sym theory. we conclude with the
ads/cft-correspondence. for completeness we have included the discussion of the bps
states in an appendix.

unfortunately, it is impossible to present in detail the whole of these subjects even
in a big book, hence, our presentation is sketchy. we hope that it highlights the main
ideas and gives some food for thought about the matters in question. we are not trying
to review this broad subject, and our reference list is therefore far from complete; a more
or less complete one can be found in [16].

2 bosonic string theory

at present only rst quantized string theory [1, 3, 4] is fully constructed. this is quantum
mechanics of string world-sheets, which are two-dimensional spaces swept by quantum
strings during their time evolution inside target space. as for the relativistic particle the
action for the relativistic string is proportional to the area of its world-sheet:

s z d2q det|gab|,

gab = a x b x,

(1)

where a (a = 1, 2) are coordinates on the world-sheet and x() ( = 0, d  1) are two-
dimensional functions describing the embeddings of strings into d-dimensional at target
space.

however, the action (1) is nonlinear and, hence, dicult to quantize. to make it
quadratic in x one includes a new dynamical variable into the theory  the string
intrinsic metric hab [1]. in this case string theory is described by a two-dimensional -
model interacting with two-dimensional gravity:

sst =

1

2 z d2 h hab a x b x +

1

2 z d2 h,
hab  h1
ab .

h = det |hab|,

(2)

here  is the inverse string tension. usually it is taken to be much smaller than any
distance scale which has been probed by experiments so far.

on the level of classical equations of motion hab  gab. hence, the action (2) is
classically equivalent to that in eq. (1). on the quantum level, however, these two theories
at least naively are dierent (see, however, [1]). in fact, in the functional integral of theory
(1) there is a summation over all possible string world sheets, i.e. over embeddings x.
while in theory (2) the sum is taken over all possible metrics on each world-sheet and
over the world-sheets themselves.

from now on we will be dealing with theory (2). this theory is invariant under
the reparametrization transformations: a  fa(), which represent general covariance
on the string world-sheets. via this two-parametric symmetry one could get rid of two
components of the metric:

ds2 = hab da db = exp [(z, z)] dz dz, where

z = exp [1 + i 2].

for a world-sheet with spherical topology this can be done unambiguously, while for the
torus and higher topologies, this can be done only up to a complex structure [3, 4]. we
are not explaining the details of the complex structure, because we are not going to use
this notion (except the fact that it exists) anywhere below.

after the above reparametrization gauge xing our action is still invariant under the

conformal transformations:

exp [(z, z)]  |zf (z)|2 exp [(z, z)],
using them it is possible to get rid of the internal metric giving

z  f (z),

z f (z) = 0

6

s

st =

1

2 z d2z z x z x + faddeev  popov ghost terms.

(3)

we do not discuss here what are faddeev-popov ghosts because we do not use this notion
(except the fact that it exists) anywhere below. a more or less compleete discussion of
the faddeev-popov ghosts within the string theory one can nd in [3].

the possibility of getting rid of the metric as in (2) is completely true only classically.
in fact, after quantization of the -model (2) there is the so called conformal anomaly
[1, 3, 4], because conformal symmetry is broken by quantum eects. hence, (z, z)
becomes a dynamical eld.
it is necessary to cancel the anomaly since otherwise it is
not known how to calculate string theory correlation functions [1]. contributions to the
anomaly coming from x ( = 0, ..., d  1) and from the faddeev-popov ghosts cancel
each other if d = 26.
furthermore there is a remnant of reparametrization invariance on string world-sheets
with higher topologies, which is referred to as modular invariance. the modular trans-
formations act on the complex structures [3, 4]. one must also respect this invariance,
because otherwise there could be problems with gravitational and gauge anomalies in the
target space, and hence unitarity would be violated.

2.1 generating functional

only if all these symmetries are respected can one properly dene the fundamental quan-
tity of bosonic string theory:

zg =

dance with reparametrization, conformal and modular invariances [1].

xg=0z [dhab]gdx exp"i sst x , hab, g, b, , t!#.

z(cid:18) g, b, , t (cid:19) =
xg=0
(4)
here the measure qd1
=0 dx is as for d scalars, while [dhab]g should be dened in accor-
the sum in this formula is over the genus g of the string world-sheets. this is an
expansion over string loop corrections which are present in addition to the aforementioned
-model quantum corrections. if one considers only closed strings these correction are
represented by spheres with g handles, otherwise they are discs with holes and handles
of the total number2 g.
we start with a discussion of closed bosonic string theory. in this case the action in
(4) is:

sst(cid:18)x , hab, g, b, , t(cid:19) =

h hab g(x) a x b x +

1

2z d2 

+ ab b(x) a x b x +  h r(2) (x) + h t (x)

,

(5)

2it is worth mentioning at this point that open string theory contains closed one on its loop level. in
fact, the annulus amplitude (the rst loop correction in open string theory) is equivalent to the cylinder
amplitude (the tree level in closed string theory). beside that, unitarity demands that closed string
excitations should be added to the ones of open string.

7

where ab is the completely anti-symmetric tensor in two dimensions and r(2) is two-
dimensional scalar curvature for the metric tensor hab.

now we see that dilatons vev  gives a coupling constant for the string loop

expansion:

zg  exp(cid:26)i



2 z d2hr(2)(cid:27) = exp [2 (g  1) ] = g2 (g1)

s

,

(6)

furthermore substituting g = , b = 0,  = 0 and t = 1 into (5), one gets for sst
the former expression (2).

the physical meaning of z (g, b, , t ) is that it is the generating functional for am-
plitudes of interactions between the smallest mass string states. in fact, we can get such
amplitudes via variations of the functional z over the sources g, b,  and t . we are
interested only in the smallest mass states because we need to nd a classical limit (large
distance behavior) of string theory. it is exactly this limit where we would use what is
known from our world. this is the reason why we do not include any other sources, which
would correspond to massive states, into the functional integral (4), (5).

2.2 low energy spectrum

why do the operators in (4), (5) with the sources g, b,  and t correspond to the smallest
mass states? first it is necessary to explain how a two-dimensional operator is related to a
string state. the action of an operator on the vacuum of the conformal theory (2) excites
it. if we take a particular harmonic of a source (for example, t = : exp [i p x] :), it looks,
from the target space point of view, as some moving string in a particular quantum state.
in fact, it is a plane wave inside target space.

furthermore it is not necessary to modify the functional integral (4) to describe in-
teractions of string states. this is one of the main dierence between string theory and a
eld theory describing particles. it relies on two fundamental facts: first, in contrast to
particle paths, for any disconnected set of one-dimensional manifolds it is always possible
to nd a two-dimensional string world-sheet which has these manifolds as components
of its boundary. such a world-sheet represents a feynman graph for a string amplitude
and components of its boundary represents initial and nal states of a process in string
theory. second, because of conformal symmetry, one can always amputate external legs
in a string amplitude. this is to say that by a conformal transformation it is possible
to shrink them, and each component of the one-dimensional boundary to points on the
world-sheet where corresponding vertex operators are acting.

to show why the operators in question correspond to the smallest mass excitations,

let us consider an n-point correlation function [1]:

an =z nyj=1

d2j do1(cid:16)x(1)(cid:17) ...on(cid:16)x(n )(cid:17)e ,

(7)

where the average h...i is taken with the functional integral (4), where the action is as
in (2). also, oj are some operators with conformal weights3 j equal to 2, so that the
3the denition of the conformal weight j of an operator oj is as follows: oj(cid:16)j(cid:17) = joj(cid:16)j(cid:17).

8

integrals over d2j are conformaly invariant. appropriate operators include those present
in (5), such as:

(8)
og has a well dened conformal weight if g = f : exp [i p x] :, where f is some
polarization from the target space point of view.
in the integral (7) there is a region where 1  2 and close to it one could use the

og = g : z x z x : .

operator product expansion (ope):

lim

12 oi(1)oj(2) xk

cijk |1  2|kji ok(1),

(9)

where the sum in the rhs runs over a basis of local operators in the world-sheet conformal
theory. using this ope, one nds [1]:

an =z d2z nyj=2

3  c12k  ho1 o2 oki and we have taken the integral over || up to a scale a
now take into account that the operator t (x) = : exp [i p x()] : has the conformal
weight equal to p2
/2. one can nd this weight using wicks theorem for the two-point
correlation function of this operator [1] and the propagator for x from the action (2).
furthermore, for g proportional to : exp [i p x()] : we have the conformal weight for
the operator (8) equal to p2
/2 + 2. operators from (5) have the same conformal weight
provided b and  are proportional to : exp [i p x()] :. likewise for other sources (not
present in (5)) also taken to be proportional to : exp [i p x()] : one obtains p2
/2 + k,
where k > 2 due to local operators which stand near sources like the operator : z x z x :
which stands behind g in eq. (8).

(10)

thus, in any channel where i  j we have in the rhs of (10) a sum over all

propagators of string excitations each corresponding to some operator ok:

an =xk

a(k)
3 a(k)

(11)

in conclusion, there is a relation between conformal weights of operators ok and masses
k = 2 (k  2)/. our observation shows that t
of the corresponding string states m2
describes a tachyonic state with m2
 = 4/, because t = 0. at the same time
g, b and  describe massless states (g,b, = 2), while all other operators correspond to
massive ones (k > 2).

t = p2

2.3 a relation between gravity and string theory

bearing the above considerations in mind, we could consider string theory at distances
(set by g, b,  and t ) much bigger than . first, in this case one can replace separate
quanta (8) by smooth elds: as in the case of passing from photons to radio waves. second,
in this situation massive string excitations are decoupled. this means that we have to
obtain a eld rather than string theory at the distance scales in question.
in fact, a
free string is equivalent to innitely many free particles: the string propagator is just
an innite sum of particle propagators (11). hence, forgetting about massive particles
reduces the sum in (11) to nitely many smallest mass excitations.
in this way at scales in question and when d = 26 one nds [17]:

z(cid:18) g, b, , t (cid:19) =

1

16n z d26xg exp [2 ] r + 4 g   
t t 2 + o(, n ).

g t t +

(12)

this is 26-dimensional dilaton gravity interacting with the anti-symmetric tensor h 
[b]. here n  g2
s 12 is the 26-dimensional newtons constant; from now on o(, n )
schematically represents two-dimensional -model and string loop corrections. if you will,
the latter contribution is due to string massive modes.

equation (12) means that in the limit   0 (in comparison with a characteristic
scale given by functions g, b,  and t ) the z functional gives exactly the same feynman
vertices and propagators as the leading contribution in the rhs of (12). unfortunately,
this fact can be explicitely established only for the simplest background elds g, b,  and
t . for example, for the at metric with constant background b and . problems appear
because there are no well developed methods of quantization of the non-linear -model
(5) with arbitrary sources g, b,  and t . the best we can do now is to nd that the
vacua on the lhs and rhs of (12) are equivalent. in fact, conformal invariance of the
-model (5) imposes conditions on the sources [1, 3]:
it is necessary to have vanishing
-functions for the sources g, b,  and t . these conditions are nothing but equations of
motions for the action (12).

there is a way to intuitively understand why one should obtain this particular action
(12) from string theory. the action (5) is invariant under innitesimal transformations of
g and b elds given by:

g  g + (), b  b + [],

(13)

of which the rst is nothing but the general covariance of the graviton eld. it is necessary
(but not sucient) to respect these invariances to maintain the unitarity of the theory.
now the goal would be to nd a large distance eective action for the sources in z which
is invariant under the transformations in question. it is easy to see that action (12) is
the only low energy one which obeys these conditions and includes interactions with the
dilaton . the reason why z = s(sources) rather than z = exp [ is(sources)] is
that we are dealing with rst quantized string theory.

10

2.4 open bosonic string theory

now let us consider open bosonic string theory. to maintain poincare invariance in the
target space one naively (see the fourth chapter) could think of using only the neumann
boundary conditions on the coordinates x of the open strings.

as we have already mentioned, open string theory contains closed string theory at loop
level. hence, open bosonic string theory contains all the same sources in its generating
functional as in (4), besides that, it contains sources for its own excitations. furthermore
at open string ends one can add quantum (chan-paton) numbers (indices), taking values
in the fundamental representation of a gauge group.

thus, following the same reasoning as above one could nd the massless open string

vertex operator to be a path-ordered wilson exponent4:

tr p exp(cid:26)izboundary

a(x) tx d(cid:27) ,

(14)

where t is a tangential derivative to the strings boundary and  is some parameterization
of the latter. the presence of the operator (14) in (4) means that the ends of the strings are
charged with respect to a. it is a gauge eld, taking values in the adjoint representation
of the gauge group. in fact, the eq. (14) is invariant under the gauge transformations:

a  a +  + iha, i.

as for closed bosonic string theory, the open string generating functional is equivalent
at large distances to 26-dimensional dilaton gravity (12) interacting with ym theory for
the gauge eld a.

2.5 on unication of gravity and yang-mills theories

let us discuss for a moment the possible relation of string theory to quantized einstein
gravity and its unication with gauge interactions. the action (12) is written through
the use of the so called string metric. from the latter, one can pass to the standard
einstein metric through the rescaling ge = g exp [ 4 ]. hence, the 26-dimensional
einstein-hilbert action appears as a part of the large distance or classical approximation
to quantum string theory. moreover, both gauge and gravity theories could be treated on
the same footing: as approximations to string theory. furthermore one could obtain a
four-dimensional theory via so called compactications [3, 4]. to do that one considers
26-dimensional world as a product of a non-compact four-dimensional space with some
very small compact 22-dimensional one. both of the spaces in question should be solutions
to the equations of motion following from (12).

all that seems to be promising. however, closed bosonic string theory contains a
tachyonic excitation t with m2
t = 4/. this is a pathological excitation. for its
presence means that during the quantization we have chosen an unstable vacuum.
in
fact, the tachyon is a negative mode excitation over the vacuum, moreover, in closed
bosonic string theory higher self-interaction terms for the tachyon seemingly do not seal
this instability. hence, one does not know the true vacuum or even whether it exists at
all in closed bosonic string theory.

4note that there is also open string tachyon which we do not consider here.

3 type ii superstring theory

to obtain a sensible string theory one should consider supersymmetric generalizations
of bosonic string theories [3, 12]. there are several non-anomalous types of superstring
theories. here we are going to discuss only closed type ii strings in the neveu-schwarz-
ramond (nsr) formalism. in this case susy is added to bosonic string theory via anti-
commuting  elds which are world-sheet super-partners of x. in principle one must
take into account the world-sheet metric eld and its super-partner as well, however, as
in the case of bosonic string, via xing symmetries of superstring theory we could get rid
of the elds in question.

thus, as a starting point we have n = 1 two-dimensional sugra interacting with
conformaly invariant matter, represented by x and  [1, 3, 4]. this is a susy extension
of the theory described by (2). due to the presence of conformal symmetry the susy
reparametrization invariance of the action is enhanced to superconformal symmetry. as
we discuss below, it is necessary to do some extra work to obtain susy inside target
space.

we consider here hamiltonian quantization5 of type ii superstring theories. free

superstrings are described by the action (z = exp [1 + i 2]):

ssst =

1

4 z d2z (cid:16)zx zx +  z + c.c.(cid:17) +
+ faddeev  popov ghost terms,

(15)

where we have eliminated the world-sheet metric eld and its super-partner via susy
reparametrization and superconformal invariances.

in theory (15) one must impose the standard periodic boundary conditions on x:
x(1, 2 + 2) = x(1, 2). at the same time, to respect the aforementioned modular
invariance, the quantum theory of superstrings should contain sectors with two types of
possible boundary conditions for the world-sheet fermions [1, 3, 4]. the rst type of
boundary condition is due to ramond (r):

while the second one is due to neveu and schwarz (ns):

(2 + 2) = (2),

(16)

(17)
with the same conditions for  in both cases. therefore, there are two kinds of mode
expansions for solutions of free two-dimensional dirac equation z = 0:

(2 + 2) = (2).

(r),

(ns).

(18)

(z) =xn

c
n+1/2
zn+1/2

5now that we have presented the main statement of string theory, we would like to present some other
ways of quantizing the theory. for our purposes hamiltonian quantization [3] of superstrings is more
transparent than the functional integral approach [1].

(z) = 

0 +xn

b
n
zn

12

there is a similar but independent expansion for (z) as well. it is conformal invariance
which allows us to treat the left (z) and right (z) sectors independently:
in conformal
eld theory they do not interact with each other.

we omit the mode expansion for x because the corresponding creation operators do

not lead to massless excitations in superstring theory.

3.1 quantization and massless spectrum

to quantize superstring theory (15) one imposes the standard commutation (anti-commutation)
relations on its bosonic (fermionic) elds. then the modes dn and cn+1/2 with positive
and negative ns become, correspondingly, annihilation and creation operators. at the
same time, the zero modes 

0 generate the algebra of dirac -matrices:

0 , 

{

0} = .

(19)

superstring states are constructed by multiplications of states from the left sector by
states from the right sector that satisfy a level matching condition. thus, since boundary
conditions can be assigned independently in the left and right sectors, there are four kinds
of states:

ns  gns ns  r
r  gns r  r .

(20)

to nd masses of excitations in this theory it is necessary to use the two-dimensional

energy-momentum tensor:

1
2

1
2

(z x)2 +

t (z) = t11 + t22  2 it12 = 

(21)
in the left sector. the energy-momentum tensor in the right sector t (z) is the complex
conjugate of (21). the corresponding conserved hamiltonians are l0 = r dzt (z) in
the left sector and similarly l0 in the right sector. hence, the total hamiltonian is
h = l0 + l0 + const, where the constant comes from the normal ordering and has
dierent values in the r- and ns-sectors [3, 4]. with such a hamiltonian one nd the
smallest mass sates [3, 4]:

 z

m2 = 2/
m2 = 0

ns

|0i
c
1/2 |0i

r

|0i, 

0 |0i, 

0 

0 |0i, ...

(22)

and similarly in the gns- and r-sectors. the vacuum |0i in the r-sector is dened below,
while |0i in the ns-sector is the standard vacuum for fermions.
furthermore to maintain the modular invariance one must project both the left and
right sectors to an eigen-state of the operator (1)f [1, 3, 4]. here f counts world-sheet
fermion number in superstring theory, i.e. this operator anti-commutes with all fermionic
creation and annihilation operators. that is to say that one must take the partition
function in superstring theory to be

13

z = tr(cid:26)(cid:20)(1)f  1(cid:21) exp [ h](cid:27)

with either plus or minus sign rather than just

this is the so called gso projection. if one includes only those states which obey

z = trnexph h io .
h(1)f + 1i|statei = 0
then the tachyon state |0i in the ns-sector decouples from the spectrum, while c
state survives6. thus, in the nsgns-sector we have c

and  excitations in superstring theory.

let us now discuss what happens in the left r-sector (consideration of the right r

sector is similar) [4]. we change the basis of the zero modes 

0 to

(23)

these d

one can verify that after a susy reparametrization gauge xing there are super-
virasoro conditions on the physical states of superstring theory [3, 4]. they appear as the
standard conditions of diracs approach to hamiltonian quantization. these conditions
are:

z x  |statei = 0,

t |statei = 0,

t |statei = 0
z x  |statei = 0,

(26)

which are nothing but the conditions of superconformal invariance of superstring theory.
to cancel the anomaly in this case one has to take d = 10 rather than d = 26.
now from the rst condition in the second row of (26) it follows that: p 

at the same time, in the reference frame where p = (p0, p0, 0, ..., 0) one has that p

6it is this kind of gso projection which leads, after taking account of the both left and right sectors,
to the appearance of susy in target space. after the projection, the o-diagonal elements in (20) lead
to the target-space superpartners for the diagonal ones [3, 4].

2p0d+
0 . hence, s0 = +1/2, which leaves only si = 1/2, i = 1, ..., 4, i.e. 16 physical
vacua: 8s with an even number of (1/2) and 8c with an odd number of (1/2). these
8s and 8c states compose dierent chirality spinor representations of the ten-dimensional
lorenz group [3, 4]. in fact, 0
 generate the algebra of ten-dimensional dirac matrices
(19) and 8c and 8s are its two irreducible representations.

the gso projection keeps one of these states (8c or 8s) and removes the other. taking

into account that there are two possibilities for the vacuum:

2(cid:29) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

1
2

, ...,

1

2(cid:29) ,

(27)

one concludes that there can be two types of theories. if we choose opposite signs for the
vacua in the r- and r-sectors, we obtain non-chiral type iia theory. if we choose the
same sign, then we have chiral type iib theory.

in conclusion,

in the r and r-sectors the massless states (25) have target space
fermionic quantum numbers [3, 4]: depending on a choice (27) they are ten-dimensional
fermions ether of one chirality |i or of the other | i. schematically it means that in the
r r sector there are states as follows:

(iia)

(iib)

(cid:16)[1...n+1](cid:17)  | i,
(cid:16)[1...n+1](cid:17) |i,

(28)

where  are ten-dimensional dirac matrices in the weyl-majorana representation. these
states correspond to the bosonic tensor elds a1...n with the eld strengths f1...n+1 =
[n+1a1...n]. now we see that due to the chirality properties of the massless states, in
type iia theory there are only odd rank a elds. at the same time in type iib theory
only even rank a elds are present.

type ii string theories are invariant under two susy transformations in the target
space (q and q), which correspond to the left and right sectors on the world-sheet,
respectively [3, 4]. this is the reason why one refers to these string theories as type ii.

3.2 type iib superstrings at large distances

below we mostly consider type iib string theory (type iia theory is very similar) with

its bosonic massless excitations. besides the standard nsgns elds g, b and , this

theory contains r r elds which are the scalar a, two-form tensor potential a, four-
form tensor potential a and their duals. in fact, by construction, among the elds
described in (22)-(28) there are various duality relations:

f1...9 = 1...10 10a
f1...7 = 1...10 f 8910
f1...5 = 1...10 f 6...10.

(29)

here 1...10 is the completely anti-symmetric tensor in ten dimensions.

as in bosonic string theory, superstrings contain target space sugra at large dis-
in the case of superstring theory it is known how to calculate its generating

tances.

functional only if d = 10, which is when the superconformal anomaly is canceled. thus,
the bosonic part of the large distance type iib ten-dimensional sugra action is [3, 4]:

s 4 is the ten-dimensional newtons constant. furthermore in this action
here n = 86g2
one must impose the self-duality condition on the r r four-form eld as shown in the
last row of (29). there are also various dual versions of type iib sugra, which are
expressed through the dual tensor elds from (29).

thus, we see that superstring theories are self-consistent and lead at large distances
(classical limit) to sugra theories. now we are ready to discuss various solitons in
sugra and string theories.

4 d-branes and sugra solitons

in sugra theory there are many dierent solitons [4, 19]. in ten dimensions they could
be particle-like black holes or dierent types of branes (membranes etc.) which are multi-
dimensional analogues of four-dimensional black holes. their singularities live on multi-
dimensional sub-manifolds of ten-dimensional target space and are surrounded by multi-
dimensional event horizons. they can be neutral or charged with respect to some tensor
gauge elds (like b or the r r elds discussed in the previous section) just as point-like
black-holes can be charged with respect to gauge vector elds: one could surround the
locus of a soliton by a multi-dimensional sphere and then nd a ux of a corresponding
tensor eld.

now, keeping in mind the fact that string theory suggests us quantization of gravity,
one could ask what are the quantum counterparts of these solitons? besides being of
academic interest, the answer to this question could reveal some features of black hole
thermodynamics [4, 18]. furthermore, as we discuss below, it gives a relation between
sym theory and sugra.

the problem is that to pass from large distance gravity to microscopic string theory
one needs to vary the parametrs  (measured with respect to a characteristic scale) and
gs in string theory.
it happens that during this variation when background elds are
turned on, corrections o(, n ) in (30) could become more relevant than the leading
large distance contribution. as we briey discussed in the introduction, these corrections
even could change the form of the background completely. first, this destroys the event
horizon, which appears to be a low energy global characteristic [4, 6]. geometrically it is

16

seen when the size of the horizon of a soliton becomes smaller than the string characteris-
tic scale. second, a variation of the parameters in question could lead to an uncontrollable
renormalization of the charge and tension of a soliton or even to a change of the funda-
mental degrees of freedom in the theory. in fact, we do not have the complete knowledge
of string theory dynamics.

however, in the presence of susy one could control the renormalization of the low
energy (large distance) action. furthermore there are solitons in susy theories for which
the renormalizations of their mass and charge are under control [11]. they are referred
to as bps solitons and respect at least some part of the susy transformations in such
theories. note that arbitrary excitations do not respect any symmetries, while the fact
that susy is respected imposes strong restrictions on possible dynamics [12].

furthermore of all bps solitons in string theory, quantum counterparts are known only
for those which are charged with respect to the r r tensor elds. for only in the latter
case does a good two-dimensional conformal eld theory description exist. although
historically r r bps sugra solitons were found rst [19] and only after that their
quantum d-brane description [9], we start our discussion with the denition of d-branes.
then we explain their relation to sugra solitons and to sym theory.

4.1 denition of d-branes

one could wonder if it is possible to consider open string sectors in closed type ii su-
perstring theories. it appears that to avoid anomalies [4] open strings in these sectors
should have both neumann (n) and dirichlet (d) type boundary conditions on string
coordinates [9]:

nxm = 0, m =  m, m = 0, ..., p (n)
xi = c i, i =  i
i = p + 1, ..., 9 (d),

(31)

where c i are some xed numbers and n is a normal derivative to the string boundary.
therefore, in such a situation the ends of open strings can freely move only along directions
labeled by m. in fact, they are conned to (p + 1)-dimensional sub-manifolds placed
at xi = ci in ten-dimensional target space. these sub-manifolds, lling completely p
directions and situated at xi = ci, are referred to as dp-branes. at the same time in the
bulk of the target space there are ordinary type ii closed strings.

the dp-branes have several features which are relevant for our further discussion.
first, they break poincare invariance inside target space p(10)  p(1 + p)  so(9  p).
hence, to maintain p(10), one should consider these dp-branes as dynamical excitations
in superstring theory. second, to respect susy one must consider p = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 for
type iia and p = 1, 1, 3, 5, 7 for type iib theories7 [4] (see below). third, because of
the boundary conditions (31), the dp-branes can not respect more than half of susy
transformations in type ii string theories. in fact, the two susy transformations (due to
q and q) are related to each other: the left and right sectors on the string world-sheets
are no longer independent because of the boundary conditions.

7the case p = 1 describes the so called d-instanton, which is a d-brane whose world-volume is
just a point in the ten-dimensional euclidean target space. this d-instanton is described by open strings
with dirichlet type boundary conditions in all ten directions.

17

interactions of a dp-brane with the massless closed string excitations are described

by [9]:

z(cid:18) g, b, ,{a}, a, , fermions (cid:19) =

xg=0 z [dhab]g dx d (fermions) 
 exp(cid:20) isdst(cid:18)x , hab, g, b, ,{a}, a, , fermions(cid:19)(cid:21)
where sdst(cid:18)x , hab, g, b, ,{a}, a, , fermions(cid:19) =
h hab g(x) a x b x +
+ ab b(x) ax b x +  h r(2) (x)

2 z d2 
+ r  r elds +
+z d am(xm) txm +z d i(xm) n xi + fermions.

=

(32)

here  is some parametrization of the boundary. as usual, closed strings appear at the
loop level inside open string theory. in this functional we have xed a light-cone gauge:
m(x) = xm, where  = (m, i) describes the embedding of the dp-brane into target
space.

let us clarify the meaning of the quantity (32).

if one puts g = , b = 0,
 = 0 and all r r elds with fermions to zero then equation (32) describes the time
evolution of a quantum state in a two-dimensional conformal eld theory. in fact, taking
a time slice we x initial conditions and the boundary conditions (31) and integrate over
all elds in the theory with these boundary and initial conditions. this is by denition a
quantum state. adding time gives us the time evolution of this state. in the case when all
background elds are non-trivial, the quantity (32) describes interactions of the quantum
state with these elds. moreover, we show below that (32) at large distances describes
the interactions of a sugra soliton  classical limit of the quantum state in question
 with the aforementioned sugra elds.

let us explain, following [10], the origin of the sources am and i in (32). as we have
already noted, string theory should be invariant under the transformations described
by (13). for a closed string they are respected, but when a string world-sheet has a
boundary there are boundary terms appearing after such transformations. to cancel the
rst of the transformations in (13), one must add a eld i at the string boundary. it
should transform as i  i  i/ to compensate (13). while the boundary term
appearing as a result of the transformation (13) along the dp-brane vanishes, because
poincare invariance is respected there. hence, i appear as pure gauge degrees of freedom
would if there were no breaking of poincare invariance in the presence of a dp-brane.
furthermore from this consideration it is clear what the physical meaning of these elds
is: they represent transverse uctuations of the dp-branes around their positions ci.
that is to say ci are just vevs of the elds i: i + ci  i.
likewise, to maintain the second invariance in (13), the string boundaries should be
charged with respect to an abelian gauge eld am.
in this case the boundary term
appearing after the second transformation (13) is compensated by a shift am  am 
m/. (this shift is dierent from the ordinary gauge transformation am+m of the eld

18

am.) the physical meaning of the elds am is that they describe longitudinal uctuations
of the dp-branes.

4.2 d-branes at low energies
at energies much smaller than 1/ the functional (32) acquires the following form [20]:

z(cid:18) g, b, ,{a}, a, , fermions(cid:19) = sii(cid:18) g, b, ,{a}, fermions (cid:19) +
+mp z dp+1x exp [ ]q det (gmn + bmn + 2   fmn) +
+qp z dp+1x 0...p a0...p + fermions + o(, n ),

(33)

where 0...p is the 0...p component of the (p+1)-dimensional totally anti-symmetric tensor,
and

fmn = [man],

gmn = gij mi nj + gi(mn)j + gmn,
bmn = bij mi nj + bi[mn]j + bmn.

(34)

are eld strength for am, the induced metric, and the b eld on the dp-brane world-
volume. note that in the action (33) we maintain all powers of fmn while neglecting its
derivatives.

case of type iib string theory sii is given by the leading contribution in (30). the second
contribution in (33) is so called dirac-born-ineld (dbi) action for non-linear (p + 1)-

in eq. (33) sii is the type ii ten-dimensional (sii r d10x...) sugra action. in the
dimensional (r dp+1x...) electrodynamics. its coecient is the mass per unit volume of

the dp-brane and can be found to be equal [4] to

mp =



gs(cid:16)42(cid:17)(p+1)/2

.

the third term shows that dp-branes are sources for the r r tensor elds a. in another
words dp-branes are charged with respect to the (p + 1)-tensor r r elds with charges
equal to qp [9]. taking into account the special properties of r r elds (discussed
following equation (28)), it is clear why there could be only dp-branes with p = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
in type iia and p = 1, 1, 3, 5, 7 in type iib theories [4].
what is important for our further discussion is that the action (33) is susy invariant.
in fact, dp-branes (32) respect half of the susy invariance in type ii string theories, and
obey

mp = qpl(p+1)

st

where

.

lst 

(35)

the force between any two equivalent and parallel dp-branes vanishes [4]. this is because
the repulsion due to the r r tensor eld compensates the gravitational attraction. this
is called the no force condition and is important for our further considerations.

19

4.3 d-branes as sources for r r sugra solitons
now let us probe a dp-brane at large distances, when r = xixi   (note that gs  0

to suppress the corrections o(, n )). we reiterate that it is the susy invariance of the
action (33) which allows us to go easily from large to small r (and vice versa) and the
leading contribution in (33) does not change. hence, in the process of going to large r
we could just forget about the dp-brane excitations am and i. we mean that a large
distance observer does not feel them and one could substitute in (33) their classical values:
am = i = 0 if there are no sources for these elds. thus, if there are no non-trivial
background elds g, b and , we have:

z = sii + mpz dp+1x + qpz dp+1x 0...p a0...p + o(, n ),

(36)

the second and the third terms in this equation are just sources for the curvature and the

corresponding r r eld. they could be rewritten as r dp+1x... r d10x9p(xi  ci)... ,

so solutions of the classical equations of motion for (36) with these sources appear to be
bps r r sugra solitons:

ds2 = f 1/2

p

dxmdxm + f 1/2

p

8p(cid:17) ,
exp [ 2 ] = f (p3)/2
p  1(cid:17) ,
a0...p = 

(cid:16)dr2 + r2d2
2 (cid:16)f 1

1

,

p

(37)

where p = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 in type iia and p = 1, 1, 3, 5, 7 in type iib theories [19]. these
solutions are states in sugra which are classical limits of the states (32) in string theory.
this how one nds a relation between the dp-branes and r r dp-brane sugra solitons.
at the same time, (36) describes low energy uctuations around these sugra solutions.
all the solutions (37) are bps and for any function fp they preserve half of the susy
transformations in sugra theory. the equations of motion of sugra theory (36)
(related to the closure of the susy algebra) imply [19] that fp should obey

9pfp(r) = mp  9p (xi  ci) .

(38)

here 9p is the laplacian for the at metric in the directions p + 1, ..., 9. hence, one
gets:

fp = 1 +(cid:18)rp

r (cid:19)7p

,

(39)

. note that one can neglect string corrections to (36) in the case

nxs=1  rp

|~r  ~rs|!7p

20

where rp  1/m1/(p+1)
rp  .

p

we now consider n dp-branes parallel to each other and placed at ~rs, s = 1, ..., n. we
can do that safely because of the no force condition. at low energies (large distances)
such a system of n dp-branes corresponds to a r r dp-brane soliton (37) with the charge
qp  n and

fp = 1 +

.

(40)

the tension of the soliton is mp = nmp. note that when one puts all the dp-branes on
top of each other (rs = 0 for all s) then

fp = 1 +(cid:18)rp

r (cid:19)7p

,

(41)

. in this case one could neglect string theory corrections to (36),(37),(41)

p = nr7p

p

where r7p

the solitons (37) are multi-dimensional analogs of the four-dimensional critical reissner-

nordstrom black hole. note that the event horizon of these solutions is at r = 0.

4.4 d-branes and sym
now let us probe a dp-brane at small distances r  rp with gs  0.
in this case
one could forget about long wave-length uctuations of the bulk elds g, b,  and {a}.
hence, these elds are equal to their classical values, i.e. to zero in the absence of external
sources. thus, expanding (33) in powers of a small fmn, one obtains:

z = sii + ssqed + o(, n ), where

dots in the second row stand for the fermionic super-partner terms. the latter could
be recovered from the fact that this supersymmetric qed (sqed) is maximally super-
symmetric in (p + 1) dimensions. in fact, we know from (31),(32) the number of susy
transformations under which the theory (42) is invariant. this number is 16  half of
32, which is the total number of components of supercharges in type ii string theories.

there is also another way to nd the number of susy transformations under which
(42) is invariant. one could consider ten-dimensional n = 1 (maximally supersymmetric:
there are 16 components of supercharges) sqed:

l =

1
2

f 2
 +

 

i
2

(43)

where  are majorana-weyl spinors and the super-partners of a. then one can make a
reduction of the theory to (p + 1) dimensions. that is when one considers all the elds
in the theory to be independent of (9  p) coordinates [12]. this way, changing notation
from ai to i (i = p + 1, ..., 9), one gets the theory (42) with the proper fermionic content.
furthermore during this procedure the number of susys is increased with respect to
n = 1 in ten dimensions [12]. in fact, the ten-dimensional fermions  are rearranged
into representations of the smaller poincare group p(p+1). hence, from a single ten-
dimensional fermion we obtain several lower-dimensional ones.

the low energy action (42) could also be found from another point of view [10]. at low
energies strings which terminate on dp-branes look like massless vector (am) and scalar
(i) excitations  the massless excitations in open string theory [3]. furthermore in the
limit gs  0 the coupling of open strings attached to dp-branes with closed strings in the
bulk is suppressed. at this point one nds that the low energy theory for such excitations
is susy qed  the only supersymmetric and gauge-invariant action containing smallest
number of powers of derivatives of the elds.

21

the last point of view is helpful in understanding the low energy theory describing a
bound state of dp-branes [10]. let us consider n parallel dp-branes with the same p. in
this situation in addition to the strings which terminate on the same dp-brane, there are
strings stretched between dierent branes. furthermore because the strings are oriented,
there could be two types of strings stretched between any two dp-branes. the strings
attached with both ends to the same dp-brane give familiar massless vector excitations
living on the brane. on the other hand, the stretched strings give vectors with masses
proportional to distances between corresponding dp-branes. they are charged with re-
spect to the gauge elds living on the dp-branes at their ends. therefore, the latter
vector excitations are similar to the w -bosons in gauge theories with spontaneous sym-
metry breaking. they acquire masses through a kind of higgs mechanism  splitting of
dp-branes  and become massless when the dp-branes approach each other. hence, the
world-volume theory on the bound state of n dp-branes is nothing but u(n) maximally
supersymmetric sym theory [10]:

s  mp 2 z dp+1x tr

and dm = m + i [am,] .

(44)

dots in this action stand for fermionic terms. furthermore all possible positions of the
dp-branes, composing this bound state, are given by vevs of the u(n) matrix i. note
that the potential in the action (44) has at directions. these at directions are not lifted
by quantum corrections due to the susy invariance of the action (44). thus, the u(1)
factor in the decomposition u(n) = su(n)  u(1) describes the center of mass position
of the dp-brane bound state. unfortunately we do not know any rigorous derivation of
(44) from rst principles such as the denition of the dp-branes, though, there is a non-
canonical way to formulate the non-abelian version of (32), (33), and hence of (42) [24],
which could be useful for the derivation of (44).

anyway, to sharpen the readers understanding we give one more argument in favor
of the appearance of sym on the dp-branes. when one has a stack of dp-branes, the
strings which terminate on them carry chan-paton indexes, enumerating these dp-branes.
hence, one would obtain sources like (14) for their massless excitations, where ai 
i, i = p + 1, ..., 9. this, as we know, leads at large distances to sym theory and shows
that the theory (44) is the reduction of ten-dimensional n = 1 sym to (p+1) dimensions.
it is worth mentioning at this point that one could also consider bps bound states of
dierent types of dp-branes (with dierent ps) [4]. however that is outside the scope of
this discussion.

5 ads/cft-correspondence

we see that the dp-branes have two dierent descriptions depending on what distance
one looks at them. from far away the d-branes look like sources for gravity solitons,
while at small distances one sees their quantum uctuations described by sym theory. it
seems that both limits are unrelated to each other, however, this is not so. to understand
why, from now on we are going to discuss one of the simplest situations.

22

we consider a stack of n d3-branes in ten-dimensional type iib sugra. the d3-
branes are on top of each other at x4 = ... = x9 = 0 and occupy 0, ..., 3 directions. the
corresponding sugra soliton is the self-dual r r d3-brane (29), (37), (41) with

r4

3 = 4gsn2

and q3  n.

note that the classical sugra description is applicable when r3  , that is when
gsn  1 (note that gs  0). otherwise string theory corrections are relevant and deform
the soliton (37).
the geometry of the d3-brane soliton is as follows: it has asymptotically at boundary
conditions at spacial innity, as r  r3 the ratio (r3/r)4 gets much smaller than unity.
at the same time, near the position of the source (r = 0) there is an innite throat region
of a constant curvature:

(45)

ds2 =

r2
r2
3

dxm dxm +

r2
3
r2 dr2 + r2

3 d2

5 with

exp [] = const.

(46)

by denition the throat is the region where r  r3, so that in (41) the unity can be
neglected with respect to (r3/r)4. in this way one obtains (46) from (37)(41).
as one can check directly, the metric (46) has a constant scalar curvature equal to r3.
the curvature does not diverge and the d3-brane is a non-singular soliton. in fact, the
metric (46) has the geometry of ads5  s5, where ads5 is ve dimensional anti-de-sitter
space and s5 is the ve-sphere  de-sitter space. both of these manifolds are known
to have constant scalar curvatures: s5 has positive while ads5 has negative curvature.
they are both solutions to ve-dimensional einstein equations with positive and negative
cosmological constants, correspondingly.

we now describe the geometry of ads5 space. there are many ways to present ads5
space (see, for example, [8]), but we nd the following description convenient. alge-
braically ads5 space could be represented as the universal cover of a sub-manifold in a
six-dimensional at space (w, v, xq where q = 1, ..., 4) with signature (,, +, +, +, +).
the equation dening this sub-manifold is [8]:

w 2 + v 2 

4xq=1

xq xq = r2
3,

(47)

where r3 is the radius of the sub-manifold in question and of ads5 space. thus, ads5
admits a natural action of the global so(4,2), which is its isometry group. the metric on
the ambient at six-dimensional space is:

ds2 = dw 2  dv 2 +

dxq dxq.

4xq=1

(48)

a metric on the universal cover of the manifold (47) can be found by solving equation
(47):

v = r3 r t

w =

2r1 + r2r2

3xq=1

x4 =

1

2r1  r2r2

3 

3xq=1

x2

q + t2

xq = r3 r xq, where q = 1, ..., 3

substituting this solution into equation (48) we obtain the metric for ads5 space:

(49)

(50)

ds2 =

r2
r2

3 dt2 +

3xq=1

dxq dxq +

r2
3
r2 dr2,

now let us dene the boundary of ads5 space.

which coincides with the metric for the ads5 part in (46) if xm = (t, xq) where q = 1, ..., 3.
if w, v, xq (where q = 1, ..., 4) go
to innity, after dividing the coordinates by a positive constant one obtains an equation
dening the boundary:

w 2 + v 2 

4xq=1

xq xq = 0.

(51)

the boundary is a four-dimensional manifold, because (51) is invariant under scalings
w  w, v  v, xq  xq for real non-zero . scaling by positive  one can map
(51) to the locus:

w 2 + v 2 =

xq xq = 1,

4xq=1

(52)

which is a copy of (s1  s3) /z2. one must factor over z2 here because there is a remaining
symmetry under w  w, v  v, xq  xq. universal cover of (47) has as a
boundary the universal cover of (52), which is r1 s3. the latter manifold is a conformal
compactication of the four dimensional minkowski space r3,1. in fact, for the conformal
compactication of r3,1 one adds a point at spacelike innity. in terms of the metric (50)
this could be claried as follows. there are two parts of the ads5 boundary: rst one is
at r  , which is four-dimensional minkowski space (t, xq) where q = 1, ..., 3; second
part of the boundary is a point r = 0.
from these considerations it follows that there is a natural action of so(4,2) on the con-
formal compactication of the minkowski space. this group now denes four-dimensional
conformal transformations. note that under a generic conformal transformation the point
r = 0 is mapped to a point inside r3,1. that is the reason that the compactication of
r3,1 is referred to as conformal.

note that sugra on ads5 space is invariant under a global so(4,2) symmetry. fur-

thermore sugra on the throat (46) of the d3-brane is invariant under n = 8 susy.
now let us consider the sym description of the d3-brane. this description is ap-
plicable when gs  0, and as follows from (44), the description is given by n = 4
four-dimensional sym:

are six-dimensional dirac matrices. one can see from this
i
formula that 4  gs = g2, and so when gs  0 the perturbative expansion of sym is well
dened. the theory (53) has vanishing -function because of the perfect cancellation of
quantum corrections due to bosons and fermions. hence, g is just a non-renormalizable
constant, which is in accordance with the fact that gs = exp [2 ] = const. furthermore,
at any value of g the theory is invariant under four-dimensional conformal transformations
given by so(4,2) group. the conformal symmetry extends n = 4 susy invariance of
sym theory in question to n = 8 susy.
this shows that so(4,2) is naturally realized both on the sym and sugra sides,
which is a good sign that n = 4 sym theory should be related to type iib sugra on
the ads5  s5 space with self-dual r r four-form ux8 [6]. note that classical type iib
sugra description is valid when r3/  , which corresponds, according to (45), to
taking n   as well as gsn   (note that gs  0). hence, strongly coupled n = 4
sym theory in the large n limit is applicable in absolutely the same situation as type
iib sugra on an ads5  s5 background. these naive considerations favor a relation
between the two theories in question will receive a further support below.

5.1 abc of the ads/cft-correspondence

we now wish to present in a formal way the relation which we are going to study below.
the relation is between n = 4 four-dimensional su(n) sym and type iib sugra in an
ads5  s5 background with r r four-form ux [7, 8]. it establishes that as gsn  ,
while gs  0 and n  :

*expixj z d4x j j

0(x)oj+  exp( i smin(cid:20)(ads5)n  (s5)n(cid:21)j j|u=j j
0) .

(54)

the average on the lhs is taken in strongly coupled large n su(n), n = 4 sym theory;
{oj} is a complete set of local operators, which respects the symmetries of the problem.
on the rhs of (54) smin is type iib sugra action in an ads5  s5 background with
self-dual r r four-form ux. the action is minimized on classical solutions for all its
elds: note that as r3/  gsn   string theory corrections to this sugra theory
are suppressed. the classical solutions in sugra are represented schematically as jj:
for example, j could contain tensor indexes. these solutions have values j j|u = j j
0 at
the four-dimensional hyper-surface r = u < r3 in the ads5 space and some asymptotic
behavior as u  r3 [8]. these values j0 serve as sources in the lhs. thus, we see that
type iib sugra in the bulk of the ads5 space is related to sym theory living on four-
dimensional hyper-surfaces (r = u for an arbitrary u) inside the space in question. this
is so called holography phenomenon [21, 22, 23] in quantum eld theory.
relations between the dierent parameters on both sides of (54) are:

3 = 4gsn2
r4
g2 = 4gs = const

8the self-dual r r four-form ux is present becuase the ads5  s5 geometry appears from the d3-

brane which is charged with respect to this eld.

25

mu v =

r3


rank of the gauge group = number of units of r  r ux = n  q3

u
 = energy scale on the sym side,

(55)

where mu v is an uv cuto for sym. in fact, the generating functional of sym correlation
functions (lhs of (54)) has uv divergences and needs to be regularized. hence, the sym
generating functional evolves under renormalization group (rg) ow. this is despite the
fact that there are no quantum corrections to the classical action (53) of four-dimensional
n = 4 sym theory. ads5 sugra needs to be regularized as well, as we discuss below,
and natural regularization parameter is again r3 [7, 8].
before discussing the meaning of the relation (54) let us emphasize that it is similar to
the relation (12) between string theory and gravity. in this case sugra theory appears
as an eective theory of sym. one of the dierences from the string theory statement
(12) is that now we get z = exp [i s(sources)] because sym is a second quantized
theory.
the relation between the two theories in question should be understood as follows:
there is a quantum type iib superstring theory on ads5  s5 with a r r background,
which is valid at any energies and yet to be found. this string theory is weakly coupled
when gs  0, so to keep gsn xed one should take n  . at energies smaller than
r3/ superstring theory in question has two degenerate limits, one of which happens
when g2n  gsn  1. it is described by weakly coupled n = 4 sym at large n, which
is well dened theory. the other occurs when r4
3/2  gsn  1. in this limit one must
deal with strongly coupled sym theory whose denition is not known. then the proper
description when gsn  1 is given by weakly coupled (classical) type iib sugra on the
background in question.

interpretation

5.2
consider now type iib string theory in an ads5  s5 background with r r ux corre-
sponding to the d3-brane. this theory is quantum gravity, therefore, in it one averages
over all metrics with the asymptotically ads boundary conditions. as a result, correlation
functions in this theory are independent of the choice of metric. hence, the correlators
are independent of the coordinates of the operators acting in the bulk of ads5. thus, all
correlators in the theory for operators placed in the bulk of ads5 are trivial. moreover,
because ads5 space does not contain an asymptotically at part, sugra in an ads5
background is always strongly coupled in the sense that there are no asymptotic states.
thus, it is natural to consider a quantity in ads5 sugra which generates correlation
functions of operators acting at the boundary of ads5 space. this quantity is nothing
but a wave-functional in the sugra theory. the operators in question should be those
which create or annihilate various sugra particles at the boundary. the classical limit
of such a generating functional is the rhs of (54).
it is important that correlations
between operators acting at the boundary of ads5 are non-trivial. in fact, after xing the
boundary in ads5 space there is a natural [8] choice of metric on the boundary within
the conformal class given by the bulk metric9 (50).

9the boundary metric is obtained by multiplication of eq. (50) by 1/r2 and taking r  .

26

in other words, gravity in ads5 is entirely described by an so(4,2) (conformaly)
invariant eld theory living only on its boundary, or on any four-dimensional hyper-
surface with r = u  r3. the generating functional we have considered above for ads5
gravity theory is equivalent to the generating functional of a four-dimensional conformal
eld theory10. a question to be answered is what kind of conformal theory is living on
the four-dimensional hyper-surfaces in the ads5 space?

now that we have established how the correspondence (54) can be understood from
bulk theory point of view, let us clarify how the things are seen from the boundary theory
point of view. dening the classical limit of the gravity generating functional at the
boundary one can nd (via sugra equations of motion) its value at any hyper-surface
r = u. on the boundary theory side this is seen as a rg ow from the cuto r3/ to
the energy scale u/. in fact, the lhs of (54) is nothing but the wilsonian eective
action for the boundary theory, which is dened at the energy scale r = u. at the same
time, the asymptotic behavior of sources (coecient functions) j0 as r = u  r3 is given
by perturbative -functions in the boundary theory. note that coecient functions of
the wilsonian eective action depend not only on u but also on the coordinates of the
four-dimensional space time (xm). this fact is necessary for holography to be valid from
the point of view of the theory conned to the boundary.

to explain this consider that it is holography which allows one to nd the generating
functional in the boundary theory at the energy scale u/ if one knows the value of this
functional at any other energy scale, independently of whether it is bigger or smaller than
u/. for example, if one knows the generating functional of the boundary theory at the
energy scale u/ < r3/, then it is possible to nd its value at the cuto scale r3/.
now we temporarily forget about the ads/cft-correspondence and just look at what
happens to the boundary theory. in the rg evolution of this theory we integrate out high
energy modes. if in this integration one was only keeping information about divergent
counter-terms in the limit r3/  , there would be no way to recover the uv theory
from the ir one. in fact, there could be many dierent uv theories which would ow to
the same ir one. this is in drastic contradiction with holography. to restore holography
one must keep all information about high energy modes in the rg evolution of the theory.
this is done by keeping all counter-terms, even those which are nite as r3/  .
in this way all information about high energy modes is encoded in terms of all sources
j0 provided the latter are only functions of xm. specically we mean that in the latter
case any variation of the elds in the theory could be compensated by a variation of the
sources j0(x). thus, if one knows the values of all j0 (i.e. one knows the sym generating
functional) at some r = u it is possible to nd them at any other r = u1.

unfortunately, there is no rigorous derivation of the equality (54) and one can not
straightforwardly trace the boundary theory. hence, the best that can be done now is
to present dierent points of view and to give some self-consistency arguments in favor of
the correspondence.

below we explain why sugra on the asymptotic at space of the whole d3-brane
soliton should decouple from the relation (54); why ads5 sugra is related to su(n)
sym rather than to u(n); why the limits n   and gsn   should be taken; why
r3/ (u/) plays the role of the uv cut o (energy scale) in sym theory; what species
which eld in sugra is related to which operator in sym and vise versa.

10compare this statement with (54).

27

5.3 qualitative observations

let us consider what is going on with the n d3-brane bound state at very low energies as
measured by an observer at innity [6, 16]. according to (42) in this limit the observer sees
free (non-interacting) ten-dimensional sugra in the bulk: all interactions are suppressed,
because n is small with respect to a characteristic scale in the theory. in fact:

1

s 

n z d10xgr + ... z d10x (cid:20)(h)2 +qn (h)2 h + ...(cid:21) .

(56)
here we have parametrized the metric as g =  + n h, where  is the at metric and
h represents small uctuations around it.

because all interactions are suppressed, free sugra decouples from the d3-brane ex-
citations which are described by su(n) sym (53). of all d3-brane excitations described
by u(n) = su(n)  u(1) sym those which correspond to the u(1) part are not decou-
pled from free sugra. in fact, they describe the center of mass degrees of freedom and
correspond to the source for the corresponding d3-brane soliton. hence, these excitations
are coupled to bulk sugra even in the low energy limit.

that is only one way of looking at the things. another point of view is that according
to (36) and (37), free sugra seen by the observer at innity is decoupled from the
sugra living in the throat region (46) of the r r d3-brane. in fact, the bulk massless
particles decouple from the throat region, because their low energy absorption cross section
by the d3-branes goes like [13]:

  3r8
3,

(57)

where  is the energy of an in-going scalar particle as measured by an observer at innity.
the cross section vanishes as we lower . this behavior can be understood as follows: in
the low energy limit the wave-lengths of particles in the bulk become much bigger than
the typical gravitational size of the brane r3. hence, long wave-length uctuations do
not see regions of size  r3.
at the same time, (57) is equivalent to the grey-body factor for the d3-brane soliton.
in this language the behavior of the grey-body factor (57) could be understood as follows:
as we lower the energy (as measured by a distant observer) of the excitations whose wave-
function is centered close to the position of the brane (r  r3), these excitations nd
it harder and harder to climb the gravitational potential of the d3-brane and escape to
the asymptotic region. as a result, the throat region and asymptotic one do not interact
with each other in the low energy (as measured by a distant observer) limit.

in conclusion, there are two pictures describing the same phenomenon. in both cases
we have two decoupled theories in the low energy limit from the point of view of a
distant observer. in both cases one of the decoupled theories is free sugra in the ten-
dimensional at space. so, it is natural to identify the other two systems which appear
in both descriptions [6]. the latter systems are n = 4 four-dimensional su(n) sym and
type iib sugra in an ads5  s5 background with self-dual r r four-form ux.
what is most important for the whole picture is that the two theories in question
possess nite (non-zero) energies [6]. in fact, their energy scales are those which are seen
by an observer in the throat (at a xed r less than r3) rather than those which are seen
by an observer at innity. note that the gtt component of the d3-brane metric is not a

28

constant. hence, the energy er of an object as measured at a constant position r and the
energy e measured by an observer at innity are related by the red-shift factor:

e = f 1/4

3 er.

(58)

from this it follows that the same object, having xed nite energy, as brought closer
and closer to r = 0 would appear to have smaller and smaller energy to an observer at
innity.

5.4 additional arguments

in this subsection we present a few more calculations which favor the correspondence (54).
1. first, we explain how one nds relations between operators on the lhs and elds
on the rhs of (54). for the massless excitations in sugra one could use (33) or its
non-abelian generalization [24]. take for example the dilaton eld. it couples to sym as
follows:

s z d4x exp [(xm, i)] "f 2

mn +

6xi=1 |mi|2 + fermions# .

(59)

note that the dilaton eld depends on the i elds in addition to xm. that is to say the
dilaton eld is a function of all ten coordinates rather than only of four xm. we are going
to consider small uctuations of the dilaton eld around the background (46). hence, we
expand exp [] in powers of the dilaton eld and the eld itself in powers of i. then
from (59) we obtain:

sn z d4x i1...in(i, x)|i=0  i1...in "f 2

mn +

6xi=1 |mi|2 + fermions#! .

(60)

we can see from this that the n-th spherical harmonic of the dilaton eld in s5 (i.e. a
kk mode in s5) couples to the operator

n [i, am]  i1...in "f 2
o

mn +

6xi=1 |mi|2 + fermions#

the non-abelian generalization of this operator is:

o

n h i, ami  tr (i1... in)  f 2

mn +

6xi=1 |dm i|2 +

1

2xi>jh i, ji2

+ fermions .

(61)

one can conclude from this that the zero mode of the dilaton eld (n = 0) couples to the
sym action (53). similarly from (33) one can nd that the zero mode of the graviton
eld gmn(x, i = 0) couples to the sym energy-momentum tensor.

in general the method of nding relations between sugra elds and sym opera-
tors is based on matching of their symmetry properties under the group so(4,2) [16].
remarkably, it appears that for each sugra eld in the chiral representation of (the
susy extension of) so(4,2) group there is a sym operator transforming in the same
representation [16] and vice versa.

29

it is worth mentioning at this point that there are other symmetry arguments in favor
of the validity of the ads/cft-correspondence [25, 16], though, we are not going to
discuss them here.

2. second, bearing the above considerations in mind, let us examine the relation (54)
in more details. following [7, 8], we consider the zero mode of the dilaton. the action for
a dilaton eld in the ads5 background in the linear approximation is [7, 8]:

s() =

2r8
3

32n z d4x dz

1

z3 h(z)2 + (m)2i + ...

here the metric on the ads5 space is taken as:

(62)

(63)

ds2 =

r2
3

z2 (cid:16)dz2 + mn dxm dxn(cid:17) , where

z =

r2
3
r

.

in this metric the boundary of ads5 space is minkowski space at z = 0 plus a point at
z  .
the action (62) is divergent for those classical solutions which are regular on the
boundary and fall o for large z [7, 8]. to regularize this divergence there is a natural
cuto of ads5 space at z =   /r3. this is an infrared (ir) regularization of ads
sugra.
now any classical solution with (z = , x) = 0(x) could be expanded in those
which obey (z = , x) = exp [i km xm], where km is a four-momentum [8]. the unique
normalizable [7, 8] solution with the latter boundary condition and which is regular as
z   is [7, 8]:

(xm, z) =

(kz)2 k2(kz)
(k)2 k2(k)

exp [i km xm] where k = |km|.

(64)

here k2 is the modied bessel function. the action for this solution is equal to [7, 8]:

where 0(x) = exp [i km xm]. we have got a prefactor of n 2 in the integrals (65) because
r2

0, from higher order
corrections in (62).
at the same time, the generating functional in the sym picture is:

z(0) =z dam ... exp(

i

mn + ...i +

i

g2z d4x 0(x) trh f 2

mn + ...i) . (66)

dots in this equation stand for the superpartners of am. now 0(x) is a source for the
operator which is the sym classical action. according to (54) and (33) it should be equal
to the dilatons boundary value (z = , x).

integrating over the sym elds in (66), we get:

z(0) = const  expnconst  i z d4xz d4y 0(x)  0(y)

up to quadratic order in the dilaton. because of restrictions imposed by n = 4 susy
invariance we know the exact value of the correlator:

dtrh f 2

lm(x) + ...i trh f 2

np(y) + ...ie 

n 2

|xm  ym|8 .

(68)

here n 2 appears as the number of degrees of freedom in sym theory. in fact, n = 4
sym theory is superconformal and, hence is not conning: the degrees of freedom are the
same at all scales.

now in eq. (67), (68) there is an uv divergence when x = y. it can be regularized
via point splitting. concisely this means that all distances in four-dimensional space-time
must be bigger than some regularization parameter . in this regularization scheme we
have:

dtrh f 2

lm(x) + ...i trh f 2

np(y) + ...ie

(69)

in conclusion, if we equate  = , we nd an agreement between the lhs and rhs
of (54). furthermore, we nd that the ir regularization on the sugra side is related
to the uv one in sym [7, 8]. thus, r3/ plays the role of a uv regularization on the
sym side. note that one could vary the sym uv regularization parameter as well as the
position of the boundary of the ads5 space by so(4,2) transformations. in other words,
one could place the hyper-surface on which sym lives to any position r = u inside ads5
space by an so(4,2) transformation.

the check we just performed could also be extended to other sym operators and

sugra elds to obtain other agreement [16].

3. third, at this point one could ask: what is the meaning of the string theory for
n = 4 sym? normally such a string representation means connement in the theory [1].
in fact, consider the wilson loop:

w (c) = tr p exp(cid:20)i ic

dxm am(cid:21).

(70)

in this formula c is some contour inside four-dimensional space-time and the trace is
taken in the fundamental representation of the gauge group.

the string representation of ym theory means that the wilson loop expectation value
could be represented as a sum over string world-sheets c having c as their boundary:

hw (c)i =xc

exp [i s(c)]

(71)

for some string theory action s(c). regularly this tells us that in euclidean space if
one takes a large loop c then this becomes:

hw (c)i  expha(min
c )i,

(72)

c ) is an area of the minimal surface min

where a(min
spanned by c. this signals linear
potential between the sources in the fundamental representation of the gauge group and
hence connement [1].

c

31

one can use the ads/cft-correspondence in euclidean space [27, 26, 28] to nd a
representation like (72) for the wilson loop expectation value in n = 4 sym. the answer
for strongly coupled sym theory is the same as in (72), but now a(min
c ) is a regularized
[27, 26] area of the minimal surface spanned by the contour c. the latter now lives on
the boundary of ads space. at the same time, the string world-sheet lives inside ads5
space.

note that we do not expect connement for a conformal theory, because one has the
same degrees of freedom in such a theory at all scales. thus, the question appears: why
does an answer like (72) for the wilson loop average in n = 4 sym theory not lead to
connement? in other words, as the area enclosed by c on the boundary is scaled up, why
is the area a(min
c ) not scaled up proportionately? it is the ads geometry that is helpful
[28]. in fact, the answer to this question is clear from so(4,2) invariance: if we rescale c
by xm  txm, with a large positive t, then by conformal invariance we can rescale min
c ,
by xm  txm and z  tz (see (63)), without changing its area a. thus the area a need
not be proportional to the area enclosed by c on the boundary. since, however, in this
process we had to scale z  tz with very large t, the surface min
c which is bounded by a
very large circle c should extend very far away from the boundary of ads5 space. this
is perfectly consistent with ads geometry. direct calculation in [27, 26] shows that these
considerations are correct.

there exist other arguments in favor of the validity of the ads/cft-correspondence
[16], but we stop here, since we hope that this is enough to convince the reader that the
ads/cft-correspondence should be correct.

6 conclusions and acknowledgments

thus we see that the ads/cft-correspondence gives a rst example of a string theory de-
scription of sym. it is worth mentioning that analogues of the ads/cft-correspondence
could be established also for sym theories in other dimensions [29]. moreover, it could be
generalized to conformal ym theories with less susy [30, 31]. there are generalizations
of the ads/cft-correspondence for non-conformal theories [28, 32, 33].

furthermore as is usual for such kinds of statements, which relate two seemingly
unrelated theories, this correspondence is useful for both of its constituents [16]. besides
the fact that the correspondence suggests a string description of sym, it gives a quantum
description of gravity in terms of sym. we mean that at distances much smaller than the
string characteristic one (when g2n  1) we have a sym description of quantum gravity:
as we mentioned the ads sugra appears as an eective theory for sym. also, as we
noticed above, the ads/cft-correspondence gives an explicit example of the holography
phenomenon, which can be important for understanding of quantum gravity.

for integrity we would like to criticize the status of the whole subject. first, we see
that it is possible to nd a string description of ym theory only in the most simplied
situation. in fact, the string description is found when ym theory is maximally super-
symmetric, when the large n limit is taken and it is more or less testable only for the
strong coupling g2n  . second, even in the latter situation the correspondence is not
derived rigorously from rst principles.
my understanding of the d-brane physics and of the ads/cft-correspondence was
formed during discussions with anton gerasimov. i would like to thank him for sharp-

32

ening of my understanding of the subject. also i am indebted to n.hambli, m.laidlow,

7 appendix. bps states

in this appendix we dene for completeness bps solitons. we present here a standard
simple exercise [11] which could, as we hope, help in the understanding why bps solitons
so special.

let us consider two-dimensional scalar susy theory:

s =z d2(cid:20)1

2

(a)2 +

i
2

  

1
2

v 2() 

1
2

v ()  (cid:21) ,

(73)

where  is a majorana fermion, and v () is an arbitrary function (it could be v =
 (2  2
0) or v () =  sin , for example). the theory is invariant under susy
transformations with conserved neuther current:

(74)
working with the chiral components  of the fermi eld, the chiral components q of
the susy charge can be written as follows:

sa = (b) b a  + i v () a .

in this notation the susy algebra is:

q =z d2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

(1  2)   v ()

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
 = p, q+q + qq+ =z d2 2 v ()

q2

+ = p+, q2

(75)

(76)


2
p = p1  p2.

where

the rhs of the third equality here is so called central charge z of the susy algebra. it
is proportional to the topological charge in the theory. in fact, for example, if v () =
 sin , then

z =z +



d2


2

(2 cos ) .

the latter is non-zero only for (anti-) kink solutions. from the algebra (76) one could
nd that:

p+ + p = z + (q+  q)2 = z + (q+ + q)2 ,

hence, p+ + p  |z|. for a single particle state with mass m at rest this implies

p = p+ = m 

1
2|z|.

33

(77)

(78)

this bound is saturated for the bps states, when as seen from (77)

(q+ + q)|bpsi = 0,

or

(q+  q)|bpsi = 0.

for example, this condition is satised for all kink and anti-kink solutions of this theory.
thus, the bps states compose small representations of the susy algebra: some combina-
tion of supercharges act trivially on the state, and hence does not generate superpartners
[12].

the last feature of the bps states is crucial. in fact, if susy is not broken (which
could be checked from the beginning by calculation of the witten index for the theory),
adiabatic variations of the parameters of the theory do not change representations of the
susy algebra. hence, if the equality (78) holds at some values of the parameters, then
it holds always and bps states survive quantum corrections. moreover one could control
the renormalization of the mass and charge using the equality (78), and if there is enough
susy neither mass nor charge are renormalized at all.
