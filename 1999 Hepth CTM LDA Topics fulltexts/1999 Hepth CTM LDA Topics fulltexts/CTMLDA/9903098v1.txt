abstract

complete constraint analysis and choice of gauge conditions consistent with equations
of motion is done for abelian chern simons eld interacting minimally with a complex
scalar eld.the dirac-schwinger consistency condition is satised by the reduced phase
space hamiltonian density with respect to the the dirac bracket.it is shown that rel-
ativistic invariance under boosts can be obtained only if gauge conditions were chosen
consistent with the equations of motion.moreover all gauge invariant quantities are shown
to be free of transformation anomaly.

1 introduction

canonical formalism for abelian chern-simons eld system interacting a scalar eld in
2 + 1 dimensions has been discussed by many authors15in connection with particles
obeying fractional statistics or anyons.

this system is the fundamental model for relativistic anyons,and its quantization re-
veals many intricate points concerning constrained eld systems.anyons are of physical
relevance to phenomena like fractional quantum hall eect and possibly to high tc su-
perconductivity 5.

despite its importance, the eld theory of this system remains incomplete . one reason
is the lack of explicit locality in the reduced phase space. another obstacle has been the
lack of a set of gauge conditions consistent with equations of motion. although dierent
gauge conditions have been discussed, the authors have not considered consistency with
equations of motion. as we see in section 4, the requirement is essential for the system to
be relativistically invariant. in particular, transformations under boosts ( which implicitly
involve equations of motion) must lead to proper transformations of the gauge eld a
to make the system lorentz frame independent.

in this paper we do the complete constraint analysis of the system. there are two
second class and two rst class constraints. we write down equations of motion,and then

use the freedom of gauge transformations to guess the gauge conditions consistent with
the equations of motion. we then proceed to remove extra variables by constructing
dirac brackets with the two second class constraints and the two rst class ones and their
corresponding gauge conditions treated as two pairs of second class constraints. we do
the construction of dirac brackets in steps,using a pair at each step. the reduced phase
space hamiltonian surprisingly has the same form as one obtained earlier by using wrong
gauge conditions.2

we then discuss the dirac-schwinger consistency conditions to obtain stess energy

tensor density 0i.the poincare generators are constructed , and
 anomalous transformation properties of the basic elds are discussed.it is shown that
the conserved current obeys normal transformation laws as a 2+1 vector.importance of
boost transformations to gaurantee relativistic invariance is emphasized.

the present work completes the rst stage of writing a canonical formalism for the
abelian chern-simons system.the quantization and attending operator ordering and lo-
cality properties will be discussed in a separate communication.

2 constraint analysis and equations of motion

our 2 + 1 dimensional system is described by the lagrangian density

l = (d)(d)  m2 +

where

the canonical momenta are dened by

d =   iea

0a

p = (d0) =  + iea0
p = (d0) =   iea0

all the three momenta canonical to a give rise to three primary constraints.

the hamiltonian can be written as

ie ~a  (

+ z d2x(v00 + v11 + v22)

where

~a = (a1, a2)

~ = (1, 2)

~  ~a = 1a2  2a1

(2.9)

and

0 = ie(p  p) = ie(d0  (d0))

(2.10)

and v0, v1, v2 are  undetermined velocities or lagrangian multipliers. using the canon-
ical poisson brackets

{(~x, t), p(~y, t)} = (~x  ~y)

{(~x, t), p(~y, t)} = (~x  ~y)

{a(~x, t),  (~y, t)} = 

 (~x  ~y)

we can enquire into the permanence of the primary constraints

which determine the velocities

{1, h} = 0

{2, h} = 0

v1 = 1a0 

v2 = 2a0 +

are the space components of the current  = ie




d= (d) . the pair 1, 2 is obviously second class.
the condition for permanence of the constraint 0  0 gives a secondary constraint



d  where we use the notation

{0, h} = 0 = 3  ~  ~a  0  0

(2.19)

which can be made a rst class constraint by taking the linear combination

  3 + 11 + 22 = ~  ~ +


2

~  ~a  0  0

(2.20)

where ~ = (1, 2).

as {3, h} vanishes due to earlier constraints there are no further constraints in the
system. after substituting v1 and v2 the hamiltonian can be written as

h = z d2x[pp + |~|2 + m2||2]



+ z d2x[

equations of motion can now be written

(2.21)

(2.22)

 = {, h} = p  iea0

p = {p, h} = ( ~d  ~d)  m2  iea0p

(2.28)

as expected, the undetermined  velocity v0 is still undetermined because of the rst class
constraint 0.this makes the evolution of a0
completely arbitrary the  determined
velocities v1, v2 are only partially determined as there is freedom in a0.

before turning to gauge conditions and reduced phase space via dirac brackets, we



note that, as a consequence of equations of motion the current  = ie
conserved.

d 

is

 = 0

(2.29)

3 gauge conditions and reduced phase space

we have to choose gauge conditions which have non-zero poisson brackets with the two
rst class constraints 0 and ,and which also remain satised in time.
the obvious
choice,based on the familiar case of electrodynamics is to use freedom in evolution of a0
such that we can x ~  ~a = 0 as a gauge condition for constraint  which involves ~  ~.

we see from (2.27, 2.28) that

d
dt

~  ~a = 2a0 

1


(12  21)

therfore ~  ~a will remain zero at all times if a0 is chosen to be such that

0  a0(x) +

1

 z d2yg(~x  ~y)(12  21) = 0

where g(~x  ~y) is the solution of

equal to

2g(~x  ~y) = (~x  ~y)

g(~x  ~y) =

1
2

ln(|~x  ~y|)

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

we therefore choose 0 as our rst gauge condition corresponding to the rst class

constraint 0  0, and

  ~  ~a = 0

as the second gauge condition corresponding to the rst class constraint   0.

thus our system has the following pairs of conditions

1, 2

; 0, 0

; , 

(3.5)

(3.6)

which can be treated like a set of three pairs of second class constraints.

the dirac brackets can be constructed most conveniently by eliminating extra deegrees
of freedom step by step forming new brackets from old ones by incorporating one pair

4

at a time.after forming the dirac bracket, the conditions can be strongly put equal to
zero,eliminating extra degrees of freedom.

the poisson bracket matrix c1ij = {i, j} where(i, j = 1, 2) is

c1ij(~x, ~y) =  

0

(~x  ~y)

(~x  ~y)

0

!

therefore the dirac bracket

{a, b}1 = {a, b} z d2xz d2y{a, i(~x, t)} c 1

1ij (~x, ~y) {j(~y, t), b}

(3.7)

(3.8)

gives the basic brackets { , }1 which are the same as canonical poisson brackets except
that 1, 2 are eliminated as they can be put equal to 1
2 a1 respectively
now,with the consequence that

2 a2 and  1

{a1, a2}1 =

1


(~x  ~y)

the remaining constraint or gauge conditions are at this stage

0 = 0

0 = a0 +

1

z d2yg(~x  ~y)(12  21)(y) = 0

 = (~  ~a)  0 = 0

and the reduced hamiltonian

 = ~  ~a = 0

h = z d2x[pp + |~|2 + m2||2]

 ) + e2||2| ~a|2]



+ z d2x[ie ~a  (
+ z d2x[v00 + a0]

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)

now we form the matrix c2ij from 0, 0 which again has trivial  functions as the
o-diagnol elements, and the dirac bracket{ , }2 constructed from { , }1 using c 1
gives
no changes in the brackets except that 0 and 0 can be put strongly equal to zero
eliminating 0 and a0 from the dynamics with a0 given by (3.11).

as the nal step we form dirac bracket with  and  . the bracket matrix is

whose inverse

c3 =

c 1

3 =  

0

g(~x  ~y)

g(~x  ~y)

0

!

5

(3.15)

makes the brackets{ , }3 satisfy the usual bracket relations between , , p, p.

a1 and a2 are now eliminated using strong equations

(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)

(3.20)

(3.21)

their solution is

therefore

(~  ~a)  0 = 0

~  ~a = 0

a1 = 2b , a2 = 1b , 2b =

0


1

a1 = 

a2 = +

z d2y2xg(~x  ~y)0(y)
z d2y1xg(~x  ~y)0(y)

1

if we integrate by parts assuming fast decrease of 1, 2 at spatial innity ,the expression

for a0 becomes

a0 =

1

 z d2y[1xg(~x  ~y)2  2xg(~x  ~y)1]

(3.22)

which makes it possible to write all three together ( as there is no time dependence in g);

a =

1

 z d2y[g(~x  ~y)](y)

(3.23)

thus all the degrees of freedom associated with a and their canonical momenta  are
eliminated.what remains is a scalar eld ,  with p, pinteracting with itself through a
non-local interaction determined by ~a.

the reduced phase space hamiltonian with dirac bracket{ , }3 is

h = z d2x[pp + ( ~d)  ( ~d) + m2||2]

(3.24)

with ~d = ~ + ie ~a. the equations of motion in reduced phase space are determined using
formulas like

{(~x, t), 0(~y, t)} = ie(x)(~x  ~y)

{(~x, t), ~a(~y, t)} =

ie


(~x, t) ~g(~x  ~y)

(3.25)

(3.26)

etc. where we use ~g = (g1, g2) = ij jxg(~x  ~y) and ~ = (1, 2).they are the same
equations as (2.22-25) except that now a is expressed through (3.23).

4 dirac-schwinger condition and poincare gen-
erators

the relativistic invariance of the original lagrangian is totally obscured by guage xed
non-local hamiltonian(3.24) .for a local eld system, the hamiltonian density 00(~x, t)
must satisfy the dirac schwinger consistency condition with respect to the dirac bracket
( our { , }3 we omit the index 3 now)

{00(~x, t), 00(~y, t)} = i(~x  ~y){0i(~x, t) + 0i(~y, t)}

(4.1)

6

p 0 = z d2x00 = h
p i =z 0id2x

j  = z (x0  x0)d2x

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

our 00 satises this condition as can be veried through a straightforward but tedious

calculation.the result is

0i(x) = pdi + p(di) = pi + pi + ai0

the poincare generators can now be constructed

the algebra of poincare generators is gauranteed by the dirac-schwinger conditions. of
special interest is the change in transformation properties of our basic variables  and
a.the space translation generators give the expected normal transformation

with similar formulas for p, , p and follow rather easily. for a ,we see , for example

{(x), p } = (x)

(4.6)

{a1(x), p 2} =

=

=

+1

 z d2y2xg(~x  ~y){0(y), p 2}
 z d2y2xg(~x  ~y)2y0(y)
 z d2y2y2xg(~x  ~y)0(y)

1

= +2

xa1(x)

as we are in the gauge xed reduced phase space modication of transformation properties
is expected.the  anomalous transformations are those under rotations and boosts. the
rotation generator is

(4.7)

j 12 = z d2y[y1(p2 + p2)  y2(p1 + p1)]

+ z d2y[y1a2  y2a1]0

the second integral in j 12 can be simplied to

z d2y[y1a2  y2a1]0 =

1

4

q2

where q = r d2y0 using the identity

(~x  ~y)  ~g(~x  ~y) =

1
2

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)

transformations under rotation for , p etc. contain extra innitesimal x-independent

phase transformations

{(~x, t), m 12} = (x12  x21) 

ie
2

q(~x, t)

(4.11)

7

or for x = (0, x2, x1)

{(x), j 12} = (x)  (x) = x  ie

(4.12)

gives (x) = eie(x).
the extra term has been called in the the literature the
 rotational anomaly.the transformations for  are anomaly free, as expected ,because
they are gauge invariant.

{0, j 12} = 0

{1, j 12} = (x12  x21)1  2
{2, j 12} = (x12  x21)2  1

these formulas determine the transformations for a

{a0, j 12} = (x12  x21)a0

{a1, j 12} = (x12  x21)a1  a2

{a2, j 12} = (x12  x21)a2 + a1

the boost generators

j 0i = z (y00i  yi00)d2y

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

(4.19)

lead to somewhat more involved transformation laws. the boost anomaly is no longer
a constant phase transformation;

{(x), j 0i} = (x01  x10) + ie(i)(x)(x)

(i)(x) =



z d2y(yi  xi)[(1g)(~x  ~y)2  (2g)(~x  ~y)1]

(4.20)

(4.21)

or (x) = eie(i)(x)(x)

x = x + x

,

x = (x0, x1, 0)

with similar formulas for p etc. the charge density 0 is anomaly free

{0, j 01} = x0  1

(4.22)

and a1 for example gives after frequent integration by parts to juggle derivatives and
using 00 = ii

{a1, j 01} = xa1 + a0 + 1(i)(x)

(4.23)

which shows that atransforms as a (2 + 1) vector but upto a gauge transformation with
the compensating (i)(x) determined by the boost anomaly in (x).this proves that all
gauge invariant quantities will have normal transformation because of correct transforma-
tion properties of  and a. the verication of poincare algebra is straightforward , if a
little tedious , but has been done.

5 discussion

as far as we are aware, the gauge conditions for this system have not been properly cho-
sen earlier notwithstanding the fact the reduced phase space hamiltonian and canonical
brackets are the same as obtained earlier by other authors.the question that naturally
arises is that in what way has the proper choice of gauge conditions altered the dynamics
of the system?

the answer lies in the lorentz boost transformation properties of physical quanti-
ties.for example,the boost transformation shifts the time component like in the equation
for a1 above. with wrong gauge conditions (for example a0 = 0) such a transformation
law cannot be obtained.
therefore , our system is truely frame independent and any lorentz transformation trans-
forms the basic elds  with a phase factor  which is exactly compensated by the cor-
responding  in a. therefore all physically relevant quantities such as  which are
gauge invariant have proper transformation laws without anomalies.

the intimate connection between consistency of gauge conditions with equations of
motion and lorentz transformation laws has probably been missed before because previous
authors have analysed transformations under rotations but not,to our knowledge,under
boosts.7 it is only the boosts which involve time development ,and therefore implicitly
use equations of motion. we hope that with this analysis we have not only suggested
the correct gauge conditions ,but also pointed out the relevance of transformations under
boosts for constrained systems.
