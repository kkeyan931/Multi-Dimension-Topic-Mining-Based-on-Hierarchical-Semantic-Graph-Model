we critically examine a recent suggestion that ambiguous statistics is equiv-
alent to innite quon statistics and that it describes a dilute, nonrelativistics ideal
gas of extremal black holes. we show that these two types of statistics are dierent
and that the description of extremal black holes in terms of ambiguous statistics
cannot be applied.

1.introduction.

a few years ago, it was argued 1 that extremal black holes obeyed innite quon

statistics , i .e., that quantum states of extremal black holes belonged to the (quan-

tum) boltzmannian space 2,3. this connection of extremal black holes to innite

quon statistics was later adopted by several authors 4,5 and, recently, the thermo-

dynamics of the ensemble of extremal black holes was discussed from the point of

view of statistical mechanics of ambiguous statistics 6, which interpolates between

bose and fermi statistics and was claimed to be equvalent to quon statistics.

the aim of this paper is to closely examine the supposed connection between am-

biguous statistics and innite quon statistics and their relation to the statistics of

extremal black holes. first, we briey review quon statistics and the corresponding

thermodynamics. we mention a few shortcomings of the thermodynamics of quonic

systems. then, we show that ambiguous statistics is dierent from quon statistics

and that there is no operator realization of it.

2.quon algebra.

recall that a free system of particles obeying innite quon statistics is described by

the following commutation relations 2 (existence of the unique vacuum state |0 > is

assumed ):

aia

j  qa

jai = ij,

(1)

ai|0 >= 0

< 0|0 >= 1.

here i, j are discrete indices,i, j = 1, 2, ...m, and the parameter q is a real number,

q  r.

the main properties of quons are as follows:

2

(i) norms of the states are positive denite for 1 < q < 1.

(ii) for q2 6= 1, the commutation relations do not exist between annihilation (cre-

ation) operators ai,aj (a

i ,a

j), i .e., there are n! linearly independent states a

i1 . . . a

in|0 >

for dierent permutations of xed indices 1, 2, . . . , n.

(iii) the number operator exists in the form of an innite series expanded in powers

of creation and annihilation operators.

(iv) the particles obeying innite quon statistics do not have a local-eld theory,

there is no spin-statistics restriction for such particles and they can have any spin.

nevertheless, the tcp theorem and the clustering property is valid for free innite-

statistics elds.

3.statistical mechanics of the quon gas.

to discuss the statistical mechanics of the quon gas, we assume that quon parti-

cles are massive (with mass m), spinless, nonrelativistic and noninteracting. the

hamiltonian of an ensemble of particles is that of the free system :

h =

m

x

k=1

ek nk ,

(2)

where ek is the energy of the kth level and nk are the number operators counting par-

ticles on the kth level. recall that the statistical average of an observable,described

by an operator o in a given ensemble, is dened as

< o >=

t ro eh
t reh =

1
z

t roeh.

(3)

here z is the thermodynamical (grand-canonical) partition function for a multi-level

system described by m independent creation (annihilation) operators a

i ( ai ),

i = 1, 2, ..m. the partition function z for a free system described by the algebra,

eq.(1), is a power series in xk = eek ( where  denotes a chemical potential )

3

and is given by (compare ref.(7))

z(x1, ...xm ) = 1 +

m

x

k=1

=

1  z1

,

m

xk + (

x

k=1

xk)2 +    = 1 + z1 + (z1)2 +   

(4)

k=1 xk < 1 . notice that the partition function does not depend on the

for z1 = pm
interpolation parameter q, which is a generic property of all generalized statistics in

the second quantized approach. from z(x1, ...xm ) one can derive, e.g., distribution

function nk(ek) ( occupation number of the k-th level) and an average particle

number < n > as

nk(ek) = xk


xk

ln z(x1, ...xm ) =

xk

.

it is well known 8,9 that quon gas, described by eq.(6), is plagued with several

diculties. the most serious ones are:

(1) the partition functions (6) exhibit gibbs paradox which cannot be resolved

by xing the overall statistical weight of the n-particle phase space as in classi-

cal statistical mechanics, since the weight is unambiguously determined by quon

4

quantum-statistical mechanics.

(2) the entropy s or an average particle number fails to be an extensive variable of

the system; moreover, they both diverge for the critical volume v = e3.

the pathological behavior of the free quon gas can also be detected for nite m.

to show this, we apply the usual method of lagranges undetermined multipliers 10

in order to extremize the entropy s under subsidiary conditions ( constancy of the

total number of particles, n , and the total energy of the gas, e ):



nk

(s

k=1

nk  

m

x

k=1

eknk) = 0,

m

x

k=1

nk = n,

m

x

k=1

eknk = e.

(7)

here, the entropy s is related to the number of all allowed n-body states distributed

over m energy levels, w (m, n), as s = ln w (m, n). a simple counting procedure,

in agreement with (1), gives for w (m, n)

w (m, n) = x

pm

k=1 nk=n

n!

n1!n2!    nm !

= m n .

solving eq.(7) gives a constraint

ek = lnm   = const,

k = 1, 2, ..m.

(8)

in such a thermal equilibrium state , after identifying  = , one would have

xk = 1

m and z1 = 1. hence, the partition function diverges, z(x1, ...xm )  , and,

as a consequence, quantities such as < n > also diverge. the conclusion is obvious.

regardless of nite or innite m and for any 1 < q < 1, the thermodynamical

limit does not make sense for the free quon gas.

3.ambiguous statistics.

the basic idea of ambiguous statistics 6 is that only primary bose and fermi

5

statistics are allowed, but the statistics of the particle may uctuate between bose

and fermi statistics and is determined in a probabilistic way. during the interaction,

the rst particle identies the second one as either a boson or a fermion, with

respective probabilities pb and pf . the system of n particles eectively consists of

k bosons and n  k fermions and the probability of this n-particle realization is

b pn k
pk

f

. the total number of states of the system is

w (gj, nj) = j

nj
k

nj

x

k=0











gj + k  1


k




gj

nj  k
 pk

b pnj k

f

,

(9)

where gj is the number of allowed one-particle states of type j. it is claimed in

ref.(6) that the operator realization of this statistics is described by eq.(1), with

the deformation parameter q = pbpf
pb+pf

. particularly, for pb = pf , one should recover

greenbergs innite statistics with q = 0 (quantum boltzmann statistics). we have

several objections to this identication.

indeed, from eq.(9), one can derive the distribution function nj and the thermody-

namic properties by varying the entropy, as in eq.(7). however, from the denition

(9) alone, one cannot determine the operator algebra ( commutation relation ) for

the annihilation and creation operators. first of all, it is impossible to obtain the

fractional number of states, eq.(9), in fock space. whether or not there exists an

operator algebra, leading to the same thermodynamic properties as for ambigu-

ous statistics, is an open question. furthermore, we point out that the proposed

ambiguous statistics is completely dierent from innite statistics. for the case

pb = pf  p, the distribution function nj, derived from eqs.(7,9), can be rewritten

as

nj =

2p

e(ej ) + p

+

2p

e(ej )  p

 nj(p) + nj(p)

and has nothing to do with innite statistics. however, nj(p) is exactly the

6

distribution derived from the counting rule

wj(nj) =

1
nj!

(

(gj)!

(gj  p nj)!

p .

)

the thermodynamics of such a system is described in ref.(11).

in dening ambiguous statistics, two unjustied assumptions are made:

(i) first, that the annihilation and creation operators satisfy bose (q = 1), fermi

(q = +1), and quon (q = 0) statistics:

aia

j  a

jai = ij,

aia

j + a

jai = ij,

aia

j = ij,

with the probabilities p2

b, p2

f , and 2pbpf , respectively. this is in contradiction with

the initial assumption that only bose and fermi statistics are allowed.

(ii) second, in the second quantized approach, it is not mathematically correct

12 to add the above commutation relation with relative weights p2

b, p2
in order to obtain eq.(1) with the deformation parameter q = pbpf
pb+pf

f , and 2pbpf

.

instead,

one can postulate eq.(1) ab initio and investigate the thermodynamics of particles

obeying quon statistics but this thermodynamics is completely dierent from that

studied in ref.(6). hence, we may conclude that ambiguous statistics, as dened

in ref.(6), possesses no fock-like realization and is completely dierent from innite

quon statistics.

we mention that a similar idea, i .e., that, basically, only symmetric (i .e., bose-

like) and antisymmetric (i .e., fermi-like) irreps of the permutation group sn are

allowed in generalized statistics, was suggested and investigated in ref.(13). in this

approach, generalized statistics is described by an algebra for which there exists a

7

fock - like realization. the construction is based on two vacuua | > and on the

commutation rules containing a unitary operator q:

aia

j  qa

jai = ij,

q| >= 1| > .

(10)

the corresponding fock - like representations are built on a linear combination

of | > vacuua. in ref.(14) the minimal generalized statistics with permutation-

group invariance, interpolating between bose and fermi statistics, is constructed.

moreover, it is shown that aia

j can be brought to a normally ordered form without

using the operator q and that a complete theory can be formulated using a single

vacuum state |0 > (instead of | > vacuua). we notice that this type of statistics

is also dierent from innite quon statistics.

4.conclusion.

ambiguous statistics, dened through the counting rule (9), although interesting

as a possible generalization of bose and fermi statistics, is completely dierent

from innite statistics, and eq.(1) does not represent its operator realization. if one

seriously takes the suggestion that extremal black holes exhibit the q = 0 quonic

behavior, then ambiguous statistics, not being equivalent to quon statistics, does

not describe extremal black holes. moreover, the assumption that q = 0 quons may

be viewed as distinguishable particles with innite internal degrees of freedom would

also lead to diculties and would not resolve gibbs paradox 8. we believe that a

correct statistics of extremal black holes is still an interesting open question.
