abstract

the propagator is calculated on a noncommutative version of the at plane and
the lobachevsky plane with and without an extra (euclidean) time parameter.
in
agreement with the general idea of noncommutative geometry it is found that the limit
when the two points coincide is nite and diverges only when the geometry becomes
commutative. the at 4-dimensional case is also considered. this is at the moment
less interesting since there has been no curved case developed with which it can be
compared.

introduction and motivation

it was postulated some time ago [35, 36] that a noncommutative structure at small length
scales could introduce an eective cut-o in eld theory similar to a lattice but at the same
time maintain lorentz invariance. recently there has been a revival of this idea and several
new examples [24, 10, 17, 19, 18, 1, 20, 21] have been studied. the basic idea is simple
and can be illustrated by a classical particle moving in a plane, described by two position
coordinates (q1, q2) and two momentum coordinates (p1, p2). in the language of quantum
mechanics these four classical coordinates are commuting operators. in the presence of a
magnetic eld b normal to the plane the momentum operators are modied and they cease
to commute:

[p1, p2] = ieb.

(1.1)

this introduces a cellular structure in the momentum plane. it becomes divided into landau
cells of area proportional to eb. consider in this case the divergent integral

i =z dp1dp2

p2

.

the commutation relation (1.1) does not permit p1 and p2 simultaneously to take the eigen-
value zero and the operator p2 = p2
2 is bounded below by eb. the magnetic eld acts
as an infrared cut-o. if the position space were curved, with constant gaussian curvature
k one would obtain again an infrared regularization for i. in an exactly analogous fashion,
to obtain an ultraviolet regularization one must replace the coordinates of position space by
two operators which do not commute:

1 + p2

[q1, q2] = ikq12.

(1.2)

by the new uncertainty relation there is no longer a notion of a point in position space since
one cannot measure both coordinates simultaneously but as before, position space can be
thought of as divided into planck cells. it has become fuzzy. this cellular structure serves as
an ultraviolet cut-o similar to a lattice structure. if we consider for example the divergent
integral i and introduce also a gaussian curvature we nd

i  log(kk).

(1.3)

the integral has become completely regularized. there is however now a new complication;
the right-hand side of (1.3) seems not to depend on the operator q12. we have argued
elsewhere [25] that, endowed with an appropriate dierential structure, each fuzzy space-
time supports a uniquely determined gravitational eld and that the latter is a classical
manifestation of the commutation relations plus a dierential structure. from this point of
view what we put on the right-hand side of (1.2) will depend on which gravitational eld we
wish to regularize the integral with. that is, in fact k does depend on q12.

in section 2 we shall give a description of how the integral i of (1.3) is to be calculated in
the case of a general algebra a. the propagator is an element of the tensor product h  h
of two copies of a hilbert space h  a. we represent a  a as an algebra of operators on
the tensor product l2(v, d)  l2(v, d) of two copies of another hilbert space l2(v, d)
of functions on a manifold v , square integrable with respect to some measure d. we then
express l2(v, d) l2(v, d) as the tensor product of a hilbert space d  l2(v, d), which
represents the diagonal elements of a  a, and an extra hilbert space f , which describes

2

the o-diagonal expansion. this must be done in a way consistent with the commutation
relations. those of f eectively force the distance from the diagonal in the tensor product
to be quantized and exclude the value zero.
in the examples we shall see that if one
were to interpret a given set of matrix elements of the propagator of the tensor product
as a propagator on an ordinary space then it would appear to be associated to a non-
in section 3 we apply the formalism to the case of
local dierential operator [42, 33].
a noncommutative version [26] of r2 with a at metric obtained by setting q12 = 1.
in
section 4 we shall be interested in a noncommutative version [23, 5] of the lobachevsky
half-plane, the surface of constant negative gaussian curvature. finally in section 5 we
examine briey the extension to dimension 4 and the problem of lorentz invariance. in this
paper we consider innite-dimensional algebras. there are also models which are described
by nite-dimensional algebras [25, 37] where the fact that the n-point elements are well-
dened is automatic.

2 the general theory

in general consider any -algebra a with a trivial center, in some representation with a
partial trace and let  be a linear operator on a with a set of eigenvectors r  a and
corresponding real eigenvalues r:

r = rr.

the parameter r here designates a point in some parameter space and we write the integral
on this space as a sum over r. the corresponding classical action is

s = tr(),

  a.

(2.1)

the trace here must be dened in some representation of a. we shall assume that with
respect to this trace
(2.2)

tr(

rs) = rs

and we dene the hilbert space h  a of 1-particle states to be
|ar|2 < }.

h = { =xr

arr : xr

as usual the ar become operators when the eld is quantized. for f  h the completeness
condition can be written as

rtr(

r).

 =xr
w =xr

if we introduce the element

r  
then the completeness condition can also be written

r

tr2(w  1  ) =   1.

the tensor product is here over the complex numbers and the subscript on the trace indicates
that it is taken over the second factor. the element w is therefore the noncommutative

3

generalization of the dirac distribution in the commutative case; it is not an element of
h  h. we introduce also the element g dened by the formal sum

g =x 1

r r  
r.

(2.3)

since obviously g = w this element generalizes the propagator corresponding to . we
wish to discuss the conditions under which the sum converges and g can be considered as a
well-dened element of a weak closure of h  h.

it is possible to give a second formal denition of g using the noncommutative version
of the euclidean path integral. let s[, j] = s[] + tr(j) be the classical action of an
interacting scalar eld in the presence of an external source j  a. the term s[] would
be a sum of the kinematical term (2.1) and an interaction term sj [] = tr(v ()) with
v ()  a. dene the partition function z[j] and generating functional w [j] by

z[j] =z des[,j] = ew [j].

if the algebra is for example a nite matrix algebra then this integral can be considered as
well dened. otherwise we consider it as a mnemonic trick. the theory is to be dened by
the gell-mann-low expansion of the n-point elements in terms of the propagator, with or
without normal ordering. the n-point element g(n) is dened to be the functional derivative
of w [j] with respect to j:

g(n) = 

nw [j]
j1    jn

.

here the ji are dierent occurrences of j. they are all canonically equal to j but carry an
extra index to distinguish them: ji = 1     j     1 is an element of the n-fold tensor
product of h. by construction g(n) also is an element of the n-fold tensor product of h. in
particular we have

and

hij = z[j]1z d  es[,j] = z[j]1 z[j]
h  ij = z[j]1z d    es[,j] = 

j

=

w [j]

j

w [j]
j1j2

.

if s[, j] is the free action then h i0 is equal to the (bare) propagator g. the bracket is
here the quantum bracket, which we distinguish with the index j. the context will indicate
whether  designates a quantum operator or a classical element of a.
with our denitions a composite eld like n  a can appear in the interaction term si[]
of the action but hnij is not dened. to dene such objects we would, as in the commutative
case [43], introduce an extra source j(n) in the path integral and a corresponding extra term
tr(nj(n)) in the action. one might be tempted to dene for example h2ij as the image of
h  ij under the multiplication map  : a  a  a but this will not be consistent in
the classical limit. if one tries to dene the expectation values of composite elds in terms
of j one will come upon the same divergences [14, 10, 2] as in ordinary eld theory. in the
situations of interest the sum

diverges and it is not to be expected [39] that the noncommutativity of the algebra will alter
this fact. we shall nd nite results because the noncommutativity smears the vertices, as

g =xr

1
r |r|2.

4

it does points in general. by denition we have subtracted disconnected vacuum bubbles.
these could be singular; in the commutative limit they would be proportional to the volume
of space-time. if the center of the algebra is not trivial one could still obtain a divergent
result [17].

we shall restrict our attention to algebras which are generated by a set q, 1    n,

of n hermitian elements. dene q  a by

[q, q] = ikq

where k is a parameter which one can suppose to be of the order of the square of the planck
length. this however is not necessary; the experimental bounds are much weaker. we shall
suppose that a is represented as an algebra of operators on a hilbert space l2(v, d) and
we x an orthonormal basis |ii. we can write then
q |ii =xj
q
ji |ji

ij. if the algebra is commutative then q

for some set of n matrices q
i ij. as above, the
symbol  here can represent a sum or an integral depending on the basis |ii it is convenient
to choose. the index i belongs again to some parameter space which of course is not to be
confused with the space to which r and s belong. the symbol ij can represent therefore the
kronecker or dirac delta.

ij = q

consider the dierential du of the universal calculus. it is a map of a into a  a given

by duf = 1  f  f  1. we dene the variation q of the generator q as

q =

1
2

duq =

1
2

(1  q  q  1).

(2.4)

we identify q = q  1 in the tensor product and we set q = 1  q. thus we can write

q =

1
2

(q  q).

it follows from the commutation rules of the algebra that

[q, q] =

1
4

ik(q  1 + 1  q).

suppose that a set of elements q of a  a can be found such that a  a is generated by
the set {q, q} and such that
(2.5)

[q, q] = 0.

then we can write the tensor product l2(v, d)  l2(v, d) in the form

l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)  d  f

(2.6)

where q acts on d and q on f . we shall choose accordingly a basis

of l2(v, d)  l2(v, d). if q lies in the center of the algebra then the elements

|i, ki = |iid  |kif

q =

1
2

(q + q)

5

are such that equation (2.5) is satised. further one has

and with the obvious identications

q = q  q,

q = q + q

[q, q] =

1
2

ikq,

[q, q] =

1
2

ikq.

(2.7)

the tensor product in the denition of g is now to be considered as a tensor product of a
diagonal algebra a, acting on d and a variation a, acting on f . that is, we rewrite

a  a = a  a

(2.8)

in accordance with (2.6). if (2.5) is not satised the factorization (2.6) can still be of interest if
q acts only on f . in general then q will act non-trivially on the complete tensor product
d  f . we shall suppose that the denition (2.4) of q in terms of the tensor product
coincides with the intuitive notion of the variation of a coordinate. one can introduce a
new dierential calculus ( (a), d) dened by

dq = q.

(2.9)

we shall see an example of this in section 4. one would like this new calculus to be
isomorphic to the original one if q and dq are to be thought of as innitesimal variations.
let c(m) be an algebra of functions on a space m. let f be a map of m into itself and
let f  be the induced map of c(m) into itself. we set  = f () and dene  =   .
the ordinary propagator is a function of two points, an element of c(m)  c(m) and we
are interested in the limit when the two points coincide. this limit must be taken with care
since the partial derivative of a function after the limit and the limit of the derived function
with respect to one of the variables are not in general equal. we are interested in the latter
since the laplace operator which denes the propagator acts only on one of the variables. if
we set x = xx where x = f (x) then we can express the limit x  0 as   0. we wish
to study the element g(q; q) of the tensor product h  h most particularly in the limit
q  q. the q are however xed generators of the algebra and this limit must be dened
otherwise. as a possible added complication, which will however not appear explicitly in the
examples we shall consider, the generators q are in general unbounded operators. we shall
give a formal denition of the limit as a weak limit within the tensor product in terms of
variations of the basis vectors |ii. we shall use a tensor product which is not braided. we
shall return to his assumption later.

using the representation of a the propagator g = g(q; q) can be expressed as a map

g : l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)  l2(v, d).

it can be dened in terms of its (classical) matrix elements hj, j| g(q; q) |i, ii.
commutative limit k  0 one would nd

in the

with

hj, j| g(q; q) |i, ii  g(q; q) ijij 

q |ii = q

i |ii,

q |ii = q

i |ii

6

and so, at least in a quasicommutative approximation, we can identify q with a point
i  v = rn and q with i  v = rn. we shall therefore represent graphically g(q; q) as
a line between i and i:

j

i

j

i

(2.10)

the extra pair of indices (j, j) is present because in general g acts as an operator on each
end of the line. an ordinary propagator on a manifold diverges in the limit q  q. this
limit can be redened as the limit

this limit makes sense in the noncommutative case but it cannot be attained as we shall see
below. we shall use therefore the identication (2.6) to express the limit as

|ii  |ii.

|i, ki  |i, 0i  |ii.

(2.11)

in the graph (2.10) this means that the two ends of the line almost close to form a circle.
it does not really follow that |ji and |ji are related, except in the commutative limit. we
shall however suppose that
(2.12)

|j, ki  |j, 0i  |ji

with (2.11).

it is here that the representation, especially the representation of the tensor product,
becomes of importance. we shall describe the second copy f of the hilbert space using
creation and annihilation operators. we choose then the basis |kif with k  z. the states
|i, 0i are those in which collectively the operators q take their minimum value.
if we
introduce a distance s by

s2 = gqq

then we can dene the coincidence limit as a state in f on which s takes its minimum value.
in the language of quantum mechanics such a state is an example of a coherent state.

we introduce a set of n annihilation operators al with their adjoints a

m such that, as in

quantum mechanics

[al , a

m] = klm.

(2.13)

we shall see that each al annihilates and each a
l creates a unit of separation. the quantum
mechanical analogue of this separation would be the energy of the harmonic oscillator. by
analogy then we dene a diagonal state to be a state annihilated by all the al. we dene
as usual the action of al on the diagonal basis element |i, 0i  d  f by the condition
al |i, 0i = 0 and we set recursively

a

l |i, k1, . . . , kl, . . . knif = kpkl + 1 |i, k1, . . . , kl + 1, . . . knif .

the coincidence limit is attained on elements of l2(v, d)  l2(v, d) of the form |i, 0i.

the analogue of the integral i dened in the introduction is dened then by the equation

hj| g(q; q) |ii = hj| i(k2) |ii.

here  is a parameter in the operator  with the dimension of mass.
is an operator acting on d.
homogeneous and it reduces to a constant. we can write then
hj| g(q; q) |ii = i(k2) hj |ii.

in general i(k2)
in all the examples we shall consider however the space is

(2.14)

(2.15)

we represent this by the graph obtained by joining the ends of (2.10) and placing a j above
and a i below the circle which marks the join, as in the center of (2.20) below.

to calculate hj| g(q; q) |ii we must express g in terms of the al and their adjoints. for

this we write

the j 
l appear here as the components of a symplectomorphism. they are xed only to
within a redenition of the al and contain therefore 2n2 + n free parameters. this is the
number of elements of gl(2n, r) which leave invariant the right-hand side of (2.15). if we
interpret q as a string joining two points q and q then each aj creates a longitudinal
displacement. they would correspond to the rigid longitudinal vibrational modes of the
string. since it requires no energy to separate two points the string tension would be zero.
 (q) dq then it

if the dierential calculus ( (a), d) dened in (2.9) has a frame  = 

would seem more appropriate to expand the variation in the form


 (q) q =

n

xl=1

(j

l al + j

l a

l ).

(2.16)

we shall return to this ansatz in section 4. we are motivated here by the desire to make
q as similar as possible to the element dq of the dierential calculus. this would suggest,
in particular, that the condition (2.5) is fullled only if the geometry is at.

the non-local modication we shall nd in the propagator is to be associated not with
the propagator but rather with the vertices at its end points. to see this we consider now
the matrix elements

hj, j| g(q; q) |i, iihl, l| g(q; q) |k, ki =

hj|  hj|  hl|  hl| g  g |ii  |ii  |ki  |ki

of the tensor product of two copies of the propagator, which we represent by the graph

(2.18)

to form a vertex we must join the point k to the point i. following the prescription
(2.11) this means that we replace the basis element

|ii  |ki  l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)

by the basis element

we are prompted then to introduce the projection

|ii = |i, 0i  d  f .

we have used the identications

g  g = g  (1  1)  (1  1)  g

and the fact that g  g acts on

(cid:16)l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)(cid:17) (cid:16)(l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)(cid:17) =
l2(v, d) (cid:16)l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)(cid:17)  l2(v, d) =

l2(v, d)  (d  f )  l2(v, d).

since p projects d  f onto d we see that

g2 : l2(v, d)  d  l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)  d  l2(v, d).

in the commutative limit k  0 one would nd

hj, j, l| g2 |i,i, ki  g2 ijij kl

on the left-hand side of (2.19) and

hj, j| g  1 |i, ri  g ijrj 

on the right-hand side. one would normally choose as basis the eigenvectors of the position
operator so that q |ii = q
i |ii and one would normally drop the extra index on q. the
preceeding two limits would be written then respectively

hj, j, l| g2 |i,i, ki  g2(q, q, q)

and

hj, j| g  1 |i, ri  g(q, q).
the graph (2.20) in turn can be cut into the two graphs

(2.22)

this is the propagator with fuzzy vertices. it is obtained by joining (i, j) to (k, l) in the
graph (2.20) and cutting it as in (2.21). we designate it by g:

if we replace the ends of (2.20) by fuzzy vertices we obtain the graph

g : d  d  d  d

this is a 2-line vertex. we designate it by g2:

g2 : d  d  d  d  d  d.

if we join the two ends we obtain a 2-line loop which we write also g2 but now

g2 : d  d  d  d.

normally one vertex will be considered as xed. if we trace over the remaining one we shall
use still the notation g2. we give a simple example in the following section.

the theory can be readily extended to incorporate a tree-level n-line vertex. consider
as example a triple vertex. to pass from the equivalent of (2.18) to (2.20) we must replace
(2.6) by the identication

l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)  d  f  f

which is obtained by introducing

q =

(q  1  1 + 1  q  1 + 1  1  q)

10

as well as two fock spaces to describe the variations. three lines are joined to a vertex by
considering the tensor product of three propagators:

hj, j| g |i, iihl, l| g |k, kihn, n| g |m, mi

and projecting the element

|ii  |ii  |ki  |ki  |mi  |mi 

l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)

onto an element

|ii  |ki  |mi  |ii  l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)  l2(v, d)  d

the way this projection is dened will depend on which lines are to be considereed as
incoming and which are outgoing. the above construction of joining and cutting would lead
to the vextex dened by the matrix elements

the noncommutative at plane is the algebra ak generated by two hermitian elements
q1 = x and q2 = y which satisfy the commutation relation [x, y] = ik and which has over it
the dierential calculus (ak) given by [q, dq] = 0. if we introduce the two derivations

e1 =

ad y,

e2 =

ik

ad x

dual to dq then an appropriate generalization [26] of the laplace operator  with mass 
is given by

 = k + 2,

for each couple (k1, k2)  r2 we introduce the unitary elements u(k1), v(k2)  ak dened
by

k = (e2

1 + e2

2).

they satisfy the commutation relations

u(k1) = eik1x,

v(k2) = eik2y.

u(k1)v(k2) = qk1k2kv(k2)u(k1),

q = ei.

a basis for the hilbert space h is given by the eigenvectors

k = u(k1)v(k2),

k = (k1, k2)

of . the corresponding eigenvalues are

k = k2 + 2,

k2 = k2

the propagator can be written then

g(x, y; x, y) =

(2)2 z (k2 + 2)1

k  

k dk,

dk = dk1dk2.

11

we must introduce a partial trace on ak. this can be done only through a representation.
the only properties which we shall need however are the identities

tr(u(k

1)u(k1)) = 2(k

1  k1),

tr(v(k

2)v(k2)) = 2(k

2  k2).

that is:

the commutation relations (2.7) become in this case

tr(

kk) = (2)2(2)(k  k).

[x, y] =

[x, y] =

as in (2.14) we write

x = j 1a + j 1a,

y = j 2a + j 2a.

with (2.13) satised we have j [1j 2] = 1

j 1 =

j 2 =

a = x + iy

(3.1)

(3.2)

the freedom here is sl(2, r), the symplectomorphism group in dimension 2. by a renor-
malization of k we can also choose q12 = 1.

we index the basis of l2(v, d) = l2(r2, dp) by p = (p1, p2) and introduce the basis
|p, ki = |pid  |kif according to the prescription (2.6) of the previous section. we shall
also re-express the tensor product according to (2.8) and drop the tensor-product symbol.
we have then

u(k1) |pi = eik1x
since x and x commute we can write this as

|pi = eik1(x+x) |pi.

using the baker-campbell-hausdor (bach) formula

u(k1) |pi = eik1 xeik1(a+a)/2 |pi.

we nd that

and therefore

ea+a

= ea

eaek/2 = eaea

u(k1) |pi = eik1 xek2

= eik2 yeik1 xekk2/8eik1k2k/4e(k2ik1)a/2 |pi.

similarly we nd

k |pi = eik2 yeik1 xekk2/8eik1k2k/4e(k2ik1)a/2 |pi.


from these last two equations we deduce that

hp| k  

k |pi = ekk2/2hp | pi.

the product here is the tensor product (2.8). since the ak factor reduces in fact to the
identity, the product depends only on the second factor ak. we have dropped the prime
on k since the information is contained in the position in the tensor product.

the fourier transform is the map

the multiplication by x and y are transformed respectively into the operators i d1 and
i d2, which are self-adjoint on l2(r2, dk). the fourier transform respects the commutation
relations. the multiplication by x  iy are transformed respectively into b and b where

b = i 1  2 + ikk1.

the asymmetry in the fourier transform of the multiplication operators is due to our con-
vention in the choice of basis k. in the analogous calculations in the quantum hall eect
one would speak of a choice of gauge. if one introduces the gauge symmetric operators

b = ekk2/2 b ekk2/2 = i 1  2 +

that the fourier transform of the diagonal factor of k  k is a constant function and that
the projection onto the ground-state in f produces an exponential damping in momentum
space.

we are now in a position to calculate the coincidence limit of the propagator. we have

the feynman rules here are the same as the commutative ones except for an extra factor
ekk2/4 at each end of a propagator of momentum k to account for the projection onto the
ground state in f . we nd then

where i(k2) is given by the integral [33, 10, 2]

hp| g(x, y; x, y) |pi = i(k2) hp| pi

i(k2) =

1

(2)2 z ekk2/2
k2 + 2 dk.

(3.6)

with a change of variable it can be written as

i(k2) =

ek2/2ei(k2/2),
where ei(x) is the exponential-integral function. when k2  0 one nds

as a further illustration of the modied feynman rules, we calculate the 2point function

obtained by integrating over the internal vertex in

g2(q; q; q)  ak  ak  ak,

represented by (2.20). in terms of the eigenfunctions of the laplacian, the denition (2.19)
of g2(q; q; q) can be written as

g2(q; q; q) =

the fh0| 
integration over q
corresponds to taking the trace over ak. similarly to (3.3), it is straightforward to calculate

l  k |0if is the projection onto the ground state in f .

tr ak (fh0| 

l  k |0if ) = tr(eil2 yei(k1l1)xeik2 y) fh0| eik2ye2ik1xeik2y |0if

(3.8)

again, we see that the feynman rules are the same as in the commutative case, except for
an extra factor ekk2/4 at the end of a propagator of momentum k. similarly for higher
order vertices, the projection onto the ground state of the relative coordinates will lead to
an exponential damping factor with length scale set by k, since the plane-wave factors as in
(3.7) act as unitary operators which shift |0if , reducing the overlap with fh0| .

as a second example consider a 2-line loop with no momentum owing through it:

hpp| g2(q; q) |ppi =

z hpp| g(q; q) |p pihp, p| g(q; q) |p, pidp.

2hp, p| g2(q; q) |p, pi = i2(k2)hp, p| p, pi

it is remarkable that this vanishes to the same order in (k2)1 as i(k2) when k2  .
we have represented only the dierence q in terms of annihilation and creation oper-
ators. it is possible to represent also q. we shall argue below that this is necessary on a
curved noncommutative geometry. for this we introduce as well as a dened in (3.2) the
operator b = x + iy. then it is easy to see that the commutation relations (2.13) hold also
for b and that a and b commute with each other and their adjoints. we dene as usual the
commuting number operators

na =

1
k

aa,

nb =

1
k

and let |na, nbi be their common eigenvectors. the equations which dened a and b can be
inverted to yield

v(k2) = ek2(+aa+bb)/2.
v(k2) = ek2(a+a+bb)/2,

15

now it is straightforward to show that equation (3.3) can be written more generally as

the b-terms cancel. using the bach formula we nd that

k  

k = e(k2+ik1) a+(k2ik1) a

.

e(k2+ik1)a+(k2ik1)a

= ekk2/2e(k2ik1)a

e(k2+ik1)a.

thus we obtain

from the expansion

hma, mb| k  

k |na, nbi

= ekk2/2hma| e(k2ik1)a

e(k2+ik1)a |naimbnb.

ea |nai = |nai + kna |na  1i +    +

it follows then that

(k)na
na! pna!|0i.

can be calculated for any two given states. we are especially interested in the case when
ma = na. in this case

hma| e(k2ik1)a

e(k2+ik1)a |nai

hna, mb| k  

k |na, nbi

= ekk2/2(cid:16)1  kk2na +    +

(k)na(k2)na

(na!)2

na!(cid:17)mbnb.

the propagator is given therefore by

hna, mb| g(x, y; x, y) |na, nbi

=

1

(2)2 z ekk2/2

k2 + 2(cid:16)1  kk2na +    +

(k)na(k2)na

(na!)2

na!(cid:17)dk mbnb.

this equation generalizes equation (3.6) for i(k2) and reduces to it when na = 0.

a more elegant formulation can be given with a more explicit use [13, 19, 18, 2] of the

coherent state formalism. dene

a =

1
2

(x + iy)  1,

b =

1
2

1  (x + iy).

then again it is easy to see that the commutation relations (2.13) hold for a and b and that
a and b commute with each other and their adjoints. introduce, for x, y  r

z =

1
2k

(x + iy),

t (z) = ezaza

and similarly for b. then the coherent states are given by |zi = t (z) |0i. it is straightforward
to see that a|zi = kz |zi and that (x, y) are related to (x, y) by hz| x|zi = x, hz| y |zi = y.

16

we argued above that we can express the variations x and y using the tensor product of
two copies of the algebra. since

hz| k |zi = eikk1k2/2ekk2/4ei(k1 x+k2 y),
k |zi = eikk1k2/2ekk2/4ei(k1 x+k2 y),
hz| 

hz, z| k  

k |z, zi = ekk2/2eik1(xx)+ik2(yy),

we obtain

and therefore

hz, z| g(x, y; x, y) |z, zi =

when (x, y)  (x, y) it follows that

1

42z ekk2/2

k2 + 

eik1(xx)+ik2(yy)dk.

hz, z| g(x, y; x, y) |z, zi  i(k2).

the results we have obtained using only the abstract algebraic structure of the non-
commutative at plane can be of course found also using a specic representation. one
such is the standard irreducible representation of ak as an i factor on l2(r, d) given on
f ()  l2(r, d) by

u(k1)f () = eik1f (),

v(k2)f () = f ( + k2k).

a convenient basis for l2(r, d) is |p1i = eip1 with p1  r. we have then

u(k1) |p1i = |p1 + k1i,

v(k2) |p1i = eip1k2k |p1i.

the parameter p1 can be thought of as the momentum conjugate to x but this fact plays no
role here. the eigenvectors k = u(k1)v(k2) have matrix elements dened by

k |p1i = eip1k2k |p1 + k1i.

this representation has a bad classical limit. the generator x can be identied then with the
parameter  but the generator y tends to zero as k  0. to obtain a sensible classical limit
one needs two copies of l2(r, d). to see this we dene u(k1) and v(k2) on l2(r2, d d)
as the operators

(u(k1)f )(, ) = ei(ak1+bk1)f ( + ck1k,  + dk1k),
(v(k2)f )(, ) = ei(ak2+bk2)f ( + ck2k,  + dk2k).

(3.9)

if we choose a + b = 1, a + b = 1, we obtain a representation with a non-degenerate limit
with

u(k1)v(k2) = q(dc)k1k2kv(k2)u(k1).

we can conclude then that if d  c = 1 one obtains a representation of the algebra. we
conclude also that if c = d then u and v commute. the representation is therefore not
irreducible since the commutant is non-trivial. we shall choose

a = 1,

a = 0,

b = 0,

b = 1.

17

the propagator can be calculated directly in any one of the representations (3.9). one

obtains

(kf )(, ) = eidk1k2kei(k1+k2)f ( + ck1k + ck2k,  + dk1k + dk2k)

and therefore

(k  

k f f )(, ; , ) = eik1k2kei(k1()+k2( )) 
f ( + ck1k + ck2k,  + dk1k + dk1k) f (  ck1k  ck2k,   dk1k  dk1k).

consider in particular the plane-wave basis |pi = eip1+ip2 of l2(r2, d d). then we nd

k |pi = eidk1k2keip1(ck1+ck2)k eip2(dk1+dk1)k |p + ki

and therefore

k  

k |p; pi =

eik1k2kei(p1p

1)(ck1+ck2)kei(p2p

2)(dk1+dk1)k |p + k; p  ki.

we are interested in the limit p  p:

k  

k |p; pi = eik1k2k |p + k; p  ki.

the decomposition (2.8) of the tensor product ak ak is equivalent to a reparametriza-
tion of the tensor product l2(r2, d d) l2(r2, d d) induced by the linear transforma-
tion

(, , , )  (

( + ),

( + ),   ,   )

of the parameter space. the rst two of the new coordinates yield the representation space
d of x and y and the second two the representation space f of x and y.

the basis given above for the representation space is singular and it is appropriate to
change it, at least for the factor f . this is equivalent to the introduction of a form factor
f (  ,   ). for each choice of f we introduce if (k2) dened by the equation

hp; p| g(x, y; x, y) f |p; pi = if (k2)hp; p| f |p; pi.

the coherent-state basis has a fundamental cell of minimal area and the distance between
two closest points is minimal. so normally one might expect that every choice of f would
yield a value of if (k2) strictly less than i(k2). however this is not the case. for example
a sequence of f which tends to the product of two -functions,

f  (  ) (  ),

will yield a value of i(k2) which is smaller than i(k2) for suciently small values of k2.
we obtain in fact

a change of variables yields the expression

i(k2) =

comparing the two asymptotic expansions we nd

the two functions agree to the dominant term in k2 for large and small values but at least
to the sub-dominant terms it is rather i(k2) which is the smaller.

the eect we have found is due to the noncommutativity of the algebra. however we
saw that we could dene the variation of an element of a noncommutative algebra using the
tensor product of two copies of it. the eect then was formally encoded in the dierence
between a product and a tensor product; the generator x does not commute with y but it
does commute with y. in a subsequent article we shall discuss also a braided tensor product,
which has all of the properties of an ordinary product. although it is somewhat formal, one
could consider an analog in the present situation by setting also [x, y] = ik. in this case
the properties of the variation of an element would not be correctly encoded in the tensor
product. one would nd that the commutation relations (3.1) were in fact replaced by

[x, y] = ik,

[x, y] = 0.

the noncommutative propagator is seen to be exactly the classical propagator. the propa-
gator depends, we have seen, only on the variations x and y.

the self-energy of a scalar particle of total charge e and minimal radius [42] is given by

if we set this equal to the mass we nd the equation

the extra contribution due to vacuum uctuations is

ht00i0 =

1
2

3i(k2).

we have included an extra factor  to account for the physical dimensions of the eld.
considered just as a constant the vacuum energy is not a very useful quantity unless somehow

19

it can be connected to the gravitational eld equations. it is characteristic of all vacuum-
uctuation calculations that the result is too large to be a realistic source of a cosmological
solution. in some way most of this very large constant must be subtracted. one way of doing
this is to consider the variation with respect to the space-time metric just as the casimir
energy is calculated as that part of the vacuum energy which depends on the distance.

interpreted as a propagator on an ordinary manifold, g would be seen as associated to

the non-local dierential operator [33]

n l = ek /2(  + 2).

this eective non-locality is due to the quantization of the distance between the two points.
we have defended elsewhere [26] the point of view [9, 15, 8, 10, 32] that the regularization
can be considered in fact as being due to the gravitational eld. to make this point of view
consistent with the results of the present section one must consider the vacuum uctuations
as giving rise to a microscopic eld which disappears in the mean. in fact we shall argue in
section 5 that at space is to be considered as an idealized limit.

there is a simple solid-state model for the space we have just considered which has been
used in the study of the fractional quantum hall eect. the x and y correspond to the
cartesian components of the guiding centers of the landau orbits and the factor ekk2/2
which arises here because of the eective non-locality acts like the debye-waller factor. we
refer, for example, to meissner [28] for further details.

it is straightforward to add a time coordinate and consider the euclidean laplace operator

 = 2

t + k + 2

on the algebra a = c(r)  ak generated by the three hermitian elements (t, x, y) and their
inverses. the dierential calculus (a) is constructed by adding to the 1-forms dx and dy
the extra 1-form dt. the density of euclidean vacuum action is given by

ie(k2) =

4 the noncommutative lobachevsky plane

we shall dene the noncommutative lobachevsky plane to be the formal -algebra ah gen-
erated by two hermitian elements x and y which satisfy the commutation relation

[x, y] = 2ihy

20

(4.1)

where h  r and the factor 2 is present for historical reasons. we shall suppose that
h > 0. both x and y are without physical dimensions here. we dene a dierential calculus
((ah), d) over ah by introducing [5] a frame or stehbein a dened by

1 = ry1dx,

2 = ry1dy,

(4.2)

where r is a real parameter with the units of length. the structure of the calculus is given
by the commutation relations

as well as the quadratic relations

f a = af,

f  ah

(1)2 = 0,

(2)2 = 0,

12 + 21 = 0.

more details of this have been given elsewhere [5].

we shall dene [11] a metric g as a bilinear map
g(a  b) = gab

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

where from (4.3) the gab must be real constants. we shall choose gab = ab. from the
structure relations

d1 = r112,

d2 = 0

one concludes that the torsion-free metric connection has gaussian curvature k given by
k = r2.

the derivations ea dual to the 1-forms a are dened by

e1x = r1y, e1y = 0,
e2x = 0,

e2y = r1y.

in terms of them the laplace operator h can be written [4] as

 h = e2

1 + e2

2 + r1e2,

  ah.

(4.6)

first we recall the calculation of the propagator in the commutative case. in the com-

mutative limit h tends to the ordinary laplace operator on the lobachevsky plane:

lim
h0

h =  = r2 y2(2

x + 2

y ).

(4.7)

we have here introduced (x, y) as the commutative limits of the operators (x, y). the
spectrum of h in the commutative limit is given by [38] the eigenvalue equation

by the separation of variables (x, y) = f (x)g(y) we nd the dierential equations

(x, y) = k,(x, y).

2
xf (x) = k2f (x),
y g(y) = (k2 y2  r2k,)g(y)
y22

where k  r. if we dene 2 = r2k,  1/4 then
1
r2k, = 2 +
4

+ r22.

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)

the eigenvalues k, do not in fact depend on k and are innitely degenerate. if we set then
z = ik y and g(y) = zj(z), equation (4.10) becomes the bessel equation

j (z) +

1
z

j (z) + (1 +

2
z2 )j(z) = 0.

a normalized set of eigenfunctions for the laplace operator is given by

k,(x, y) = eikx3/2 sinh pyki(|k|y)

with  > 0 and k 6= 0. the case  < 0 can be excluded since

k(|k|y) = k(|k|y).

the case k = 0 is also excluded since when y  0

(4.15)

the value of a tadpole diagram created by a source j  0 is given by the quantity

il(xi) = lim

g(xi, xi).

because of the homogeneity of the space in fact il cannot vary from point to point; in
ordinary eld theory it is innite.

several interesting problems have been considered and solved [6, 22, 30, 12, 34, 16] on the
lobachevsky plane. in particular the spectrum of the laplace operator has been found [38].
recently [4] moreover the spectrum of the noncommutative operator (4.6) has been calcu-
lated.

consider now the noncommutative case. it is to be noticed that although the classical
lobachevsky plane is invariant under the reection x  x this is no longer the case when
h 6= 0. in the algebra ah any monomial (x, y) in x and y can be factorized. therefore one
can formally separate the variables in the eigenvalue problem as before and the eigenvalue
equation can be decomposed into two dierential equations. the equations for the factor
f (x) are given by

(4.16)

e2
1f (x) = r2l2
1f (x) = r2l2
e2

+y2f (x),
f (x)y2

where l  r. since the commutation relations [y, e2] and [y, yy] are of the same form, the
dierential equation for g(y) has the same form as that of (4.10) even though the algebra
has changed:

(e2

2 + r1e2)g(y) = r2(l2

y2  k,)g(y).

22

consider the function

l(z) =

it is related to the generating functional of the bernoulli numbers, which appears in one
derivation of the general bach formula. for any k  r let eikx be dened as a formal power
series in the element x; formally eikx is a unitary element of ah. then from the action of e1
on x it follows that

e1eikx = ir1l(2hk)yeikx = ir1l(2hk)eikxy.

the solution of equation (4.16) is given therefore by

f (x) = eikx,

l = l(x).

(4.17)

(4.18)

a family of formal solutions of the eigenvalue equation on the quantum lobachevsky
plane which tend to normalized functions in the commutative limit is given for k 6= 0,  > 0
by
(4.19)

k,(x, y) = 3/2 sinh yki(|l|y)eikx.

we have here introduced the quantity

l = l+(2hk).

it plays the role of the linear momentum associated to x. the quantity l(2hk) is the
linear momentum associated to x. although |k| remains invariant under the map k  k
this is not the case for |l|, a fact which is a manifestation of the breaking of parity by the
commutation relations. because of the transposition rule

eikxk(y) = k(e2hky)eikx

(4.20)

the expression for the eigenvectors can also be written with y after x. the 1-particle hilbert
space h is the space generated by the elements k,(x, y). the elements w and g can be
written then

w (x; x) =z +
 z 
g(x; x) = r2z +
 z

to proceed we must introduce a partial trace on the algebra ah which respects the
slh(2, r) invariance. this trace is a complex-valued linear form on ah which is in some
sense translation invariant, and in the limit h  0 agrees with the undeformed integral. in
the classical case, translation invariance is equivalent to stokes theorem. since we have an
slh(2, r)-invariant calculus, it is natural to dene a trace of an element of the algebra as
the integral of the dual 1-form. for any f  ah we set
tr(f ) =z f 12

where the volume 2-form,

12 = r2y1dxy1dy = r2y2dxdy,

23

is invariant under the coaction of slh(2). we determine the integral over x in turn by
requiring that stokes theorem

z d = 0.

(4.21)

hold for any 1-form . we write  = xdx + ydy. in particular if x = 0 and y = f (x)g(y)
then from (4.21) we nd that

z df (x)g(y)y2dy =z df (x)z 

0

g(y)y2dy = 0.

(4.22)

for any integrable function g(y). to analyze this we notice that (x + 2ih)dx = dxx from
which we deduce that

d(xn) =(cid:16)(x + 2ih)n1 + x(x + 2ih)n2 + . . . + xn1(cid:17)dx

n1

we conclude that in general

which is a nite-dierence operator. therefore

e2hkz eikxdx =z eikxdx

(4.23)

(4.24)

(4.25)

(4.26)

it follows then that

and therefore it is consistent to set

furthermore, in the representation given below we can identify

tr1(eikx) = 2(k).

tr2(f (y)) =z 

0

f (y)y2dy.

since dy satises the commutation relation ydy = dyy of an ordinary de rham form on the
undeformed lobachevsky space we can suppose that (4.26) holds in any case. the trace can
be factorized then in the form

tr(eikxf (y)) = tr1(eikx)tr2(f (y)).

and so, just as in the commutative case, we can set

tr(eikxf (y)) = 2(k)tr2(f (y)).

24

if x has a representation with a periodic spectrum then k takes discrete values and the
right-hand side of this equation must be replaced by 2k0. we note that for an arbitrary
element f (x, y)  ah we have

tr(eikxf (x, y)) = tr(f (x, e2hky)eikx).

in general then

tr(f g) 6= tr(gf ).
the trace denes a state which is not a trace state.

equations (4.26) and (4.25) are all the properties of the trace which we shall need. using

them and the explicit expression (4.19) for the basis we nd the orthogonality conditions

tr(

k,(x, y)k,(x, y)) = (k  k)(  ).

in order to use the general formalism we must rst decide how to introduce the annihila-
tion and creation operators. one possibility for this is to introduce generators  and  which
satisfy the canonical commutation relations [, ] = 2ih. one can then express x and y as

this yields

x =   ih,

y = .

[, ] = ih,

[, ] = ih

(4.27)

(4.28)

and the condition (2.5) is satised. if we dene

 = eix,

q = e2h

we nd the relation y = qy, which denes the quantum space r1
q. because of the
isotropy of the lobachevsky plane the laplace operator is essentially reducible to that of a
1-dimensional manifold. the extra dimension manifests itself as a dierence in the multi-
plicity of the eigenvalues. there is a certain formal analogy between the solutions given here
and the solutions [3] to the laplace operator in the quantum space r1
q.
if we express the eigenvectors in terms of the new generators we nd

k,(, ) |pi = 3/2 sinh pk 

i(|l|)eik(ih) |pi

(4.29)

and therefore

hp| k,(x, y) 

k,(x, y) |pi =

3 sinh()hp| ki(|l|)p eikeik pk 

i(|l|) |pi.

however as an added complication now the eigenvector is no longer factorized as previously
into a function of  times a function of . since we have supposed that x and x commute
we can write

eikeik 

= eik( ) = e2ik(+) = eik((i )a+(+i )a).

we have here introduced the annihilation operator a and its adjoint such that

 =

1
2

(a + a),

 =

1
2i

25

(a  a),

[a, a] = 2h.

we cannot use the simple bach formula since

[(  i)a, ( + i)a] = 2h(cid:16)aa + ( + i)(  i)(cid:17)

does not commute with (  i)a and ( + i)a. in fact these three operators form a basis
of the lie algebra of sl(2, c). the ( + i) is essentially the extra annihilation operator
b introduced in the previous section and we have thus a tensor product of two harmonic-
oscillator representations. it would seem that the propagator is impossible to calculate using
the decomposition (4.28).

if we use x and y as generators and follow the prescription of section 2 we nd that using

an ordinary tensor product

as in the previous section but the condition (2.5) is not satised:

[x, y] = ihy,

[x, y] = ihy

[x, x] = 0,

[y, x] = ihy,

[x, y] = ihy,
[y, y] = 0.

(4.30)

(4.31)

this means that x acts on f as well as d in the product (2.6). this point can be improved
upon by a change of generators. first we note that the algebra generated by (x, y) can be
identied with the algebra ah and that the dierential calculus ( (ah), d) dened by the
relations (4.31),

[x, dx] = 0,
[y, dx] = ih dy,

[x, dy] = ih dy,
[y, dy] = 0

is the same as the original ((ah), d). in fact one nds that the frame (1, 2) dened by

1 = r dx  rxy1 dy,

2 = ry1 dy

satises the same relations as the frame (4.2). in the commutative limit the new frame is
the old one expressed in the new coordinates given by the involution

x = (x) = xy1,

y = (y) = y1.

general covariance would seem to suggest then that one introduce an annihilation operator
such that

x =

1
2

(a + a) +

1
2i

x(a  a),

y =

1
2i

y(a  a),

[a, a] = h.

(4.32)

if one did this one would nd equations (4.31) to be equivalent to the conditions

[x, a] = 0,

[y, a] = 0

but that the second of the commutation relations (4.30) cannot be satised. this is to be ex-
pected since dierential forms naturally satisfy anticommutation relations. the expressions
(4.32) come from the identication

1 =

1
2

(a + a),

2 =

1
2i

(a  a)

26

and the relations satised by the frame would imply the relations a2 = 0, [a, a]+ = 0.

one can express  as the commutative limit of the change to new generators given by

x = xy1  ih,

y = y1.

this transformation is closely related to that given by (4.27). under the change of parameter
h  2h we can identify x =  and y = 1. the (x, y) satisfy the same commutation
relation as the (x, y) except for a change in sign of h. we have here dened the dierential
calculus directly in terms of the algebra; in particular, we have deduced the module structure
of the 1-forms from the commutation relation. this was possible since both the algebra and
the dierential calculus are dened in terms of an r-matrix.

a more promising decomposition uses the generator w formally dened by the equation

y = ew. using it the commutation relation (4.1) becomes

and in the commutative limit r w is the geodesic distance along the y-axis. following the
prescription of section 2 we nd that, using an ordinary tensor product,

[x, w] = 2ih

[x, w] = ih,

[x, w] = ih

and that the condition (2.5) is now satised.

the equation (4.29) becomes


k,(x, y) |pi =

3/2eikxeikx sinh pyk 

i(|l|y) |pi

and therefore

hp| k,(x, y) 

i(|l|y) |pi.
as above we introduce the annihilation operator a and its adjoint such that

k,(x, y) |pi =
3 sinh()hp| ki(|l|y)ye2ikxpyk 

x =

1
2

(a + a),

w =

1
2i

(a  a),

[a, a] = 2h.

using again the bach formula we nd that

hp| k,(x, y) 

k,(x, y) |pi =
3 sinh()ehk2

using the transposition rules

weika

(w  hk),

we conclude therefore that

hp| ki(|l|y)yeika

eikaw = (w  hk)eika

the integral can be simplied by introducing the integration variable

it becomes then

this function is not manifestly independent of the state p, that is, of the value of w. we
can write

f (, l) = g(l) h(, l)

where

is manifestly independent of w but

h(, l) = fh0| ki(le+w)k 

i(lew) |0if .

g(l) =

dhp| pid

dhp| eh1arcsinh2(hle w) |pid

(4.34)

is not.

in an attempt to clarify this we consider an explicit representation of the algebra. on

the hilbert space l2(r, d) one has the representation given on smooth functions by

(xf )() = ihf (),

( wf )() = f ().

a convenient basis is given by |pi = eip/h. we nd then the expression

e w |pi = e |pi

and the function (4.34) can be written as

g(l) =

1

dhp| pid

dhp| eh1arcsinh2(hle w) |pid = lim



1

20 z +0

0

eh1arcsinh2(hle)d =

.

this is certainly independent of  but depends in the choice of basis; the states |pi are plane-
wave states and the w coordinate is smeared out over the entire line. another choice of
representation is obtained by interchanging x and w. that is, with

(xf )() = f (),

( wf )() = ihf ().

28

in this representation w is diagonal and p is an eigenvalue, a measure of the geodesic

distance along the y-axis. it leads to

g(l) = eh1arcsinh2(hlep),

which denitely depends on p. because of the discussion that led to equation (4.32) we shall
argue below that the results are only valid at the point p = 0 on the y-axis. this would
imply that

g(l) = eh1arcsinh2(hl).

we found in the previous case that the result depended on our choice of representation of
the q-algebra; we nd here that it depends also on the representation of the q.

we set k = 2hr2 and we dene as previously il(k2) by the equation

we have then

hp| g(x, y; x, y) |pi = il(k2)hp| pi.

(4.35)

we shall leave the evaluation of h to a future publication. the integral il(k2) can be
estimated however to leading order from the fact that the uncertainty relations, as encoded
in the commutation relation between a and its adjoint, imply that fh0| w |0if & h. from
this we can deduce that

il(k2)  

log(k2) +    .

all the interesting information is in the sub-dominant terms, which appear in the dierence

ht00i0 =

1
2

3(il(k2)  i(k2)),

in the energy density with and without the curvature.

on the fuzzy sphere [25] of radius r the laplacian has n distinct eigenvectors fs with
s = s(s + 1)r2 of multiplicity 2s + 1. let { |ii} be a basis of

associated eigenvalues 2
coherent states and dene is(k2) by the equation

hi, i| g(xa; xa) |i, ii = 4r2is(k2) hi| ii2.

because of the properties of coherent states is(k2) will be independent of the state. as
in the case of the plane we write fs(xa) = fs(xa  xa) and fs(xa) = fs(xa + xa). if |ii
is the state concentrated on the north pole of the sphere then for large n we can write the
commutation relations as ([x, y]  k) |ii = 0 and identify the sphere with the tangent plane.
comparing the two cases one nds that for large n

is(k2)

(4.36)

from which we deduce that

is(k2)  i(cid:16)k(2 

1

4r2 )(cid:17).

29

we have here used the relation 4r2  2k n between the area of the sphere and the area of
the fundamental cell. we nd therefore, when k2  0 and r  , that

is(k2)  i(k2) 

1

32r22 .

it is tempting to use the dierence

ht00i0 

1

64


r2

of ht00i0 as a source in the gravitational eld equations. we shall return to a similar calcu-
lation in dimension 4 below.

if we compare (4.35) with (4.36) we see that the eigenvalues are identical except for a

change in sign in the curvature term. we can therefore reasonably suppose that

il(k2)  i(cid:16)k(2 +

1

4r2 )(cid:17).

if we dene z = x + iy then the commutation relation (4.1) which dene the algebra ah

can be written in the form

there is a caley transform

[zz] = 2ih(z  z).

z =

z  i
z + i

from the lobachevsky plane to the poincare disc. to compare the calculations of this section
with those of the at plane one might think that it would be simpler to use the disc but the
commutation relation in terms of w is rather complicated:

[z, z] = 16ih(1  z)(1  zz)(1  z).

one denite advantage of the disc is that in the commutative limit there is one point z = 0,
at which the metric assumes the gaussian normal form, with the rst derivatives of the
components equal to zero.

it would seem that when studying a noncommutative version of a general manifold one
rst has to choose a system of coordinates which are gaussian normal at a point q = q
0 .
the corresponding generators of the noncommutative tensor-product algebra must be then
studied in a coherent state |0i with h0| q |0i = q
0 . the propagator in this state is the
noncommutative version of the propagator at the point q = q
0 . from the above experience
with the lobachevsky plane we conclude that even in the case of a noncommutative version
of a homogeneous manifold h, with therefore ih(k2) a constant function, the propagator
can only be calculated in a state which is localized about a classical point at which the metric
is at least euclidean, if not gaussian normal. the problem is due to the fact that even in
the simplest of noncommutative geometries the relation of the noncommutative structure to
the metric is not well understood. this is already apparent at the commutative limit. the
poisson structure dened in this limit is in the canonical form in a system of coordinates
which in general has no obvious preferred relation to the metric.

with the addition of an extra time coordinate the algebra becomes a = c(r)  ah gen-
erated by the three hermitian elements (t, x, y) and their inverses. the dierential calculus

30

(a) is constructed by adding to the two space 1-forms a the time 1-form 0 = dt and im-
posing the standard relations. in the limit h  0, a becomes an algebra of time-dependent
functions on the lobachevsky plane and (a) the corresponding de rham dierential cal-
culus. the euclidean laplace operator of a free scalar eld is

we nd then the curved variant

it is also possible to let h vary with time but because the curvature does
not depend on the value of h there can be no dynamical evolution. since the space is
completely isotropic and homogeneous one might speculate that there is variation in h (in
space and time) only in the presence of inhomogeneities and that these latter relax to yield
a homogeneous space and a constant h. one would have to consider the time evolution of
perturbations of the lobachevsky metric to determine whether or not this is the case.

the cut-o eect which we have found was obtained using an ordinary tensor product.
as in the at case, and for the same reasons, one nds that the use of a braided tensor
product will yield a propagator which is independent of h and which can be identied with
the divergent propagator of the commutative limit [27].

5 the noncommutative at 4-space

we dene the noncommutative at 4-space as the algebra ak generated by four elements
q = x which satisfy the commutation relations [10]

[x, x] = ikj 

where j  is a non-degenerate matrix of real numbers. the associated dierential calculus
(ak) is dened by the relations [x, dx] = 0. if we introduce the derivations

e = ad ,

 =

1
ik

j 1
 x

dual to dx then an appropriate generalization [26] of the laplace operator  with mass 
is given by

for each k  r we introduce the elements u(k)  ak dened by

 = k + 2 = x

e2
 + 2.

u(k) = eikx

.

they satisfy the commutation relations

u(k1)u(k2) = qj  k1k2ku(k2)u(k1),

q = ei.

a basis for the hilbert space h is given by the eigenvectors
eik4x4

k = u1(k1)u2(k2)u3(k3)u4(k4) = eik1x1

eik2x2

eik3x3

,

k = (k1, k2, k3, k4)

31

of . the corresponding eigenvalues are k = k2 + 2 where we have set k2 = gkk. the
element g can be written then

g(x; x) =

1

(2)4z (k2 + 2)1k  

k dk,

dk = dk1dk2dk3k4.

we must introduce a partial trace on ak. this can be done only through a representation.

the only properties which we shall need are the identities

that is:

tr(u

(k)u(k)) = 2(k  k)g.

tr(

kk) = (2)4(4)(k  k).

it is most convenient to choose a generalization of the second representation given in sec-
tion 3, the one which is reducible and non-singular in the limit k  0. we represent ak as
an algebra of operators on l2(r4, dx) dened on f ()  l2(r4, dx) by

u(k)f () = eik

f ( +

1
2

kj k).

a convenient basis for l2(r4, dx) is |pi = eip with p  r. we have then
2 kj  kp |p1 + k1, p2 + k2, p3 + k3, p4 + k4i.

u(k) |pi = q

1

the eigenvectors k have matrix elements dened by

k |pi = q

1

2 kj  kp |p + ki.

the commutation relations (2.7) become in this case

[x, x] =

1
2

ikj ,

[x, x] =

1

ikj .

we introduce the operators a1 and a2 as previously in section 2 and we write

x = j

we must now address the delicate question of (euclidean) lorentz invariance. there are
two attitudes one can take. one can suppose that lorentz invariance is exact at all scales.
one must then add [10] the j  as six extra coordinates, minus possibly two because of two
invariants which can be formed. either one considers that there is no momentum associated
to these coordinates, in which case one can take an average value over them and the problem
is solved as above, or one can consider them to be ordinary coordinates like the four visible
ones, in which case they would have to be quantized also. if this be so the j  cannot lie in
the center [35]. alternatively one can admit that the tensor j  breaks lorentz invariance
on the scale of k. this manifests itself by the existence of the vectors j 
2 . however
there is also an ambiguity in the choice of creation and annihilation operators, described by
the symplectic group here of dimension 10. it is always possible then to choose a1 and a2 so
that

1 and j 

k  = g.

we shall suppose that this has been done. the issue of lorentz invariance will not ap-
pear explicitly then, except to the extent that our calculations are not invariant under the
symplectomorphism group. this is fortunate since we have motivated the introduction of
noncommuting coordinates by the desire to maintain lorentz invariance.

the integral i(k2) = i(k2, g) is given by

(5.2)

we would like eventually to compare the expression (5.2) with a curved-space analogue in
the limit of vanishing curvature; this would supply a preferred lorentz frame in the limit.

the density of (euclidean) action of a uniform, static, free scalar eld is given by

the quantity

can be interpreted [41] as a contribution of the scalar-eld vacuum uctuations to the cos-
mological constant. we would like to be able to compare this with a noncommutative
curved-space conguration but in dimension 4 we have thus far only been able to consider
the at case. in the absence of any other information we suppose the dominant contribution
to be obtained by a substitution of the form

where k is some local mean curvature. we nd then that

if the space-time has constant curvature k then   3k. consistency requires then that

therefore, if one is interested in a solution of type frw then one can identify k  8gn
and k  a(t)2 and obtain in the at case the equation
2a2(cid:17)

1922(cid:16)1 





a2 =

which has a bounce solution given by

a(t) =s 

2 (cid:18)1 +

2t2

1922(cid:19).

the eective pressure is negative [40]:

khpi0

a2(cid:16)1 



22a2(cid:17)

and the strong energy condition is violated:

k(ht00i0 + 3hpi0)  

2

3222a4 < 0.

the energy which is the eective source of the solution is the dierence between two vacuum
energies and its sign depends simply on which of the two is the larger. the minimal radius
is given by 22a2(0) =  and at this value of t the approximation to ik(k2) which we have
used is no longer valid. however ht00i0 must be a maximum at the bounce. since we know
that it is nite we see that one can certainly not trust (5.3) at t = 0.

another problem which one can consider is the self-consistent mass calculation [31]
based on a 1-loop approximation to the schwinger-dyson equation. with an interaction of
the form 4 a scalar eld acquires a mass  which must satisfy the equation 2 = 2i(k2).
that is, to leading order

this would imply an interaction constant  slightly larger than 1020.

the noncommutative torus is the formal algebra generated by the u for arbitrary xed
values of the k. it was the rst noncommutative geometry on which a yang-mills action
was proposed [7]. recently higher-loop contributions to the classical action have been
investigated [29, 21].
