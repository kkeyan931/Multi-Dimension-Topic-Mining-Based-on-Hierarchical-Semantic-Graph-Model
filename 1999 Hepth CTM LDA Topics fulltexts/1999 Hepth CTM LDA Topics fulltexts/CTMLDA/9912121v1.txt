abstract:
i review the construction of an action for open superstring
eld theory which does not suer from the contact term problems of other
approaches. i also discuss a possible generalization of this action for closed
superstring eld theory. (talk presented at 32nd ahrenshoop international
symposium on elementary particle theory in buckow, germany)

1 problems with conventional approach

the construction of a eld theory action for the superstring is an im-
portant problem since it may lead to information about non-perturbative
superstring theory which is unobtainable from the on-shell perturbative
s-matrix. this information might be useful for understanding the non-
perturbative dualities of the superstring. although there was much activ-
ity ten years ago concerning a eld theory action for the bosonic string,
there was not much progress on constructing a eld theory action for the
superstring. for reasons described below, there was no obvious generaliza-
tion of the bosonic string eld theory action to the superstring. since the
non-perturbative dualities of the superstring are not expected to have any
analog for the bosonic string, it is not too surprising that not much was
learned about these dualities by studying bosonic string eld theory.

the covariant string eld theory action for the bosonic string is based
on a brst operator q and a string eld a. in wittens approach to open
string eld theory, the gauge-invariant action is [1]

sopen = z [aqa + a3]

(1)

1

where string elds are glued together at their midpoint. this gluing pre-
scription preserves the length of the open string, so one can x the open
string length in this approach. wittens gluing procedure can be gener-
alized to closed strings by requiring that two closed strings only interact
when half of one closed string overlaps with half of the other closed string,
so that the length of the resulting closed string is the same as the length
of each initial closed string. using this gluing procedure, gauge invariance
implies that the eld theory action is non-polynomial in a, i.e. [4]

sclosed = z [a(c0  c0)(q + q)a + a3 + ...]

(2)

where ... includes contributions from all orders in a. the factor (c0 
c0) is necessary in the kinetic term from ghost-number counting since a
carries ghost-number 2 and the closed string ghost-number anomaly is
+6. because of the (c0  c0) factor, this closed string action is gauge
invariant under a = (q+ q) only if both a and  satisfy the constraints
(b0  b0)a = (b0  b0) = 0.

there is another covariant approach to bosonic string eld theory in
which open strings are glued at their endpoints and closed strings are
glued at one point only [2][3]. this approach is similar to light-cone string
eld theory where the length of the string is the momentum in the light-
cone direction. in this covariantized light-cone approach, the length of the
string becomes a free parameter which is conserved in interactions, i.e. the
length of the nal string is equal to the sum of the lengths of the two initial
strings. although this free parameter can be gauged away on-shell, it is
unclear how to treat the innities caused by integration over this parameter
in the functional integral. nevertheless, it is interesting to note that using
this gluing prescription, it is possible to construct a gauge-invariant cubic
closed string eld theory action of the form

sclosed = z [a(c0  c0)(q + q)a + a3].

(3)

as before, (b0  b0)a = 0 is required for gauge invariance. one can also
construct a gauge-invariant open string eld theory action using the end-
point gluing prescription, however, unlike the action of (1) (but like the
light-cone open string action), it is not cubic.

in generalizing these approaches to superstring eld theory, the main
diculty comes from the requirement that the string eld carries a denite
picture. recall that each physical state of the superstring is represented

2

by an innite number of brst-invariant vertex operators in the covariant
rns formalism [5]. to remove this innite degeneracy, one needs to re-
quire that that the vertex operator carries a denite picture, identifying
which modes of the (, ) ghosts annihilate the vertex operator. for open
superstring elds, the most common choice is that all neveu-schwarz string
elds carry picture 1 and all ramond string elds carry picture  1
2. for
closed superstring elds, one has an analogous choice of (left,right) picture
corresponding to the choice of neveu-schwarz or ramond in the (left,right)
sectors.

since the total picture must equal 2 for open superstrings, the obvious

generalization of the action (1) is [6]

s = z [an sqan s + arqy ar + z a3

n s + an sarar]

(4)

where z = {q, } is the picture-raising operator of picture +1 and y =
ce2 is the picture-lowering operator of picture 1. however, as shown
by wendt [7], the action of (4) is not gauge-invariant because of the contact-
term divergences occuring when two zs collide. although one can choose
other pictures for the string eld a which change the relative factors of
z and y [8], there is no choice for which the action is cubic and gauge-
invariant [9] [10]. one way to make the action gauge-invariant would be
to introduce an innite number of contact terms to cancel the divergences
coming from colliding zs. however, the coecients of these contact terms
would have to be innite in the classical action since the divergences are
present already in tree-level amplitudes. note that an innite number of
divergent contact terms are also expected in light-cone superstring eld
theory (either in the rns or green-schwarz formalisms) to cancel the
divergences when interaction points collide [11].

for the closed superstring, the total left and right-moving pictures must

both equal 2, so the generalization of the actions of (2) and (3) is [12]

sclosed = z [an s,n s(c0  c0)(q + q)an s,n s +

(5)

an s,r(c0  c0)(q + q) y an s,r + ar,n s(c0  c0)(q + q)y an s,r+

ar,r(c0  c0)(q + q)y y ar,r + z za3

n s,n s + ...].

since (5) contains zs in the interactions, this action naively suers from
the same contact-term divergences as the action of (4). however, using
the closed-string gluing prescription of (2), interaction points never collide

3

so there is no problem. but these contact-term divergences are a problem
using the covariantized light-cone gluing prescription of (3) which allows
colliding interaction points (as in light-cone string eld theory).

a problem with (5) which exists using either gluing prescription is that
the picture-lowering operators y and y do not commute with (b0b0). this
implies that the ramond contribution to the action is not gauge-invariant
under a = (q + q) even at the quadratic level. such a problem with
the ramond sector is not surprising since the type iib ramond-ramond
sector contains a massless chiral four-form state for which it is extremely
dicult to construct a kinetic action.

2 new approach for the open superstring

in these proceedings, a new approach to superstring eld theory will be
proposed which uses two brst-like operators instead of just one. this
approach is based on the fact that any critical n=1 superconformal eld
theory (such as the ten-dimensional superstring) can be described by a
critical n=2 superconformal eld theory. this n=1  n=2 embedding was
described in reference [13] where it was shown that any physical n=1 vertex
operator can be represented by a physical n=2 vertex operator, and the
scattering amplitudes coincide using either the n=1 or n=2 prescriptions
for computation. furthermore, it was shown in reference [14] that, after
twisting, n=2 physical vertex operators and scattering amplitudes can be
computed without introducing n=2 ghosts.

this ghost-free prescription was called an n=4 topological prescrip-
tion since it uses the (small) n=4 superconformal generators which can be
constructed from any set of critical n=2 superconformal generators. the
four fermionic n=4 generators will be labeled as (g+, g, g+, g) where
g+ and g are the original fermionic n=2 generators, g+ = [er j , g],
g = [er j , g+], and (er j , j, er j ) are the su(2) generators constructed
from the original u(1) generator j. after twisting, (g+, g+) carry confor-
mal weight +1 and (g, g) carry conformal weight +2.

there are three critical n=2 superconformal eld theories which will
be relevant here. the rst is the self-dual string which describes self-dual
yang-mills (open) or self-dual gravity (closed) in d = (2, 2) [15]. the
left-moving worldsheet elds of the self-dual string consist of (xa, a)
where a = 1 to 2. for the self-dual string, the left-moving n=4 fermionic

4

generators are

g+ = xa+a, g+ = x+a+a, g = x+aa, g = xaa.

(6)

a second critical n=2 superconformal eld theory is given by the n=2
embedding of the rns superstring. the worldsheet elds are the usual
rns worldsheet variables and the n=4 fermionic generators are [16][14]

g+ = jbrst , g+ = , g = b, g = {q, b} = bz + l

(7)

where q = r jbrst is the standard brst charge of the n=1 superstring,
 and  come from bosonizing the (, ) ghosts as ( = e,  = e)
[5], z is the picture-raising operator, and l is the rns stress-tensor.

a third critical n=2 superconformal eld theory is given by a modied
version of the green-schwarz superstring which describes in d = 4 super-
space the superstring compactied on a six-dimensional manifold [17]. the
left-moving worldsheet elds of this superstring consist of [xm, ,  , p,
p , ] plus an n=2 c=9 superconformal eld theory which describes the
compactication manifold. p and p  are the conjugate momenta to the
superspace variables  and  ,  is a chiral boson, m = 0 to 3, and ,  = 1
to 2. as discussed in [17], this superstring is related to the rns superstring
by a eld-redenition of the worldsheet variables. for this version of the
superstring, the four fermionic generators are

g+ = dde + g+
c,

g = d  d e + g
c,

g+ = [er j , g],
g = [er j , g+],

(8)

where d = p + i x , d  = p  + ix , j =  + jc, and [tc,
g+
c, jc] are the c=9 n=2 superconformal generators representing the
compactication.

c, g

in n=4 topological language, the on-shell condition for an n=2 open

string vertex operator v is [14]

g+

0

g+

0 v = 0

(9)

0 and g+

where g+
0 are the zero modes of two of the four n=4 superconfor-
mal generators. this linearized equation of motion is invariant under the
. note that after twisting,
linearized gauge invariances v = g+
the hermitian conjugate of g+ is g+ and v is a hermitian string eld. for
the n=2 superconformal eld theory representing the rns superstring,

0  + g+

0

5

the n=2 vertex operator v is related to the usual rns vertex operator a
by v = 0a (or equivalently, 0v = a). since (7) implies that g+
0 = q
and g+
0 = 0, the on-shell condition of (9) is equivalent to the usual rns
on-shell condition qa = 0.

so the kinetic action r aqa is naturally replaced with the action [18]
(10)

skinetic = z v g+

g+

0 v.

0

under the u(1) of the n=2 algebra, g+ and g+ carry charge +1 and v is
neutral, so the open string action violates u(1) charge by +2 as expected
for a twisted critical n=2 superconformal eld theory. this kinetic action
for n=2 superconformal eld theories is naturally extended to the non-
linear action [18]

sopen = z [(g1g+

0 g)(g1 g+

0 g) + z dt(g1g+

0 g)(g1 g+

0 g)(g1tg)]

(11)

where g = ev and the open string elds v are glued together using wittens
midpoint prescription. as in the wess-zumino-witten action, this action
has the non-linear gauge invariance

(ev ) = g+

0 ()ev + ev g+

0 ()

(12)

which replaces the linearized gauge invariances of (9).

when the n=2 superconformal eld theory is chosen to be the open
self-dual string, it is easy to show that (11) correctly reproduces the eld
theory action for self-dual yang-mills. when the n=2 superconformal eld
theory is chosen to be the modied green-schwarz open superstring of (8),
the action of (11) provides an open superstring eld theory action with
manifest four-dimensional spacetime supersymmetry which does not suer
from the contact-term divergences of all other open superstring actions. for
the uncompactied superstring, one can easily show [18] that the massless
contribution to (11) correctly reproduces the action for d = 10 super-
yang-mills written in terms of n=1 d = 4 superelds [19]. note that the
gauge invariance of (12) is reminiscent of the gauge transformation of the
super-yang-mills prepotential in n=1 d=4 superspace.

3 new approach for the closed superstring

in this section, some preliminary results are presented for the action for
closed superstring eld theory. the kinetic action of the open superstring

6

can be generalized to the following closed string kinetic action:

+

0 + g

0

)(g+

0 + g+

0 )( g+

s = z v (j ++

0 + j ++

0 )v

(13)
where j ++ = er j is one of the su(2) generators of the n=4 algebra. this
action correctly reproduces the kinetic action for self-dual gravity when
the n=2 superconformal eld theory is chosen to be the closed self-dual
string. furthermore, when the n=2 superconformal eld theory is chosen
to be the closed rns superstring of (7) and when v is a (ns,ns) string
eld satisfying (g
0 )v = 0 (which is the n=4 topological analog of
(b0  b0)a = 0), the action of (13) reproduces the (ns,ns) contribution to
the kinetic action of (2). this is easy to see since (g
0 )v = 0 implies
that v = (g

0  g
0 )w for some w , so the action of (13) is
0 + j ++

0  g

0  g

0  g

= 2 z v 00(q + q)(c0  c0)v,

which is the usual rns kinetic action if one denes v = 0 0a (or equiva-
lently, a = 0 0v ).

0  g
0 ) is ( g

it has not yet been possible to use (13) to derive the ramond-ramond
contribution to the kinetic action, or to derive the modied green-schwarz
version of the kinetic action (which would be manifestly spacetime super-
symmetric). note that the ramond-ramond contribution to the kinetic
action was computed in reference [20], but using a dierent method [10].
one problem with (13) is that the constraint (g
0 )v = 0 is not her-

0  g
0  g
mitian since the hermitian conjugate of (g
0 ). although
0  g
gauge invariance of (13) does not require that v satises (g
0 )v = 0,
it appears that such a constraint is necessary for introducing interactions.
for generalizing (13) to include interactions, one can adopt either of the
two gluing prescriptions. the covariantized light-cone gluing prescription
has the advantage that there is a jacobi-like identity satised by switching
the order of gluing three strings, i.e. (a(bc)) = ((ba)c)+((ac)b) where
a, b and c are the three strings and () denotes the gluing procedure. using
this gluing prescription and ignoring the hermiticity problem mentioned
above, one can dene the gauge-invariant non-linear action as
s = z ( v (j ++

0 )v +[v, (g+

0 + j ++

0 )v ](g+

0 + g+

0 + g+

0 + g+

0 )( g+

0 + g

)(g+

+

0

0 )v )
(14)

7

where [a, b] is dened by gluing ( g+
0 )b (which
is anti-symmetric in a and b).
if one ignores hermiticity problems, it
appears to be also possible to construct a non-linear version of (13) using
the witten-like gluing prescription.
if v satises the constraint (g

0 )v = 0, then (14) is invariant

0 )a with ( g+

0  g

+

0  g

+

0  g

under

v = (g+

( g+

0 + g

+

0 ) + (g

0 + g+
0  g

0 ) + ( g+
0 + g
0 )(( g+

+

0  g

+

0 )+

0 ) (g+ + g+)v ).

when the n=2 superconformal eld theory is chosen to be the closed self-
dual string, (14) reproduces the correct cubic action for self-dual gravity.
and when the n=2 superconformal eld theory is chosen to be the rns
superstring, (14) reproduces the correct (ns,ns) contribution.

it is easy to show that the covariantized light-cone gluing prescription
implies that [a, [b, c]]+[b, [c, a]]+[c, [a, b]] = 0, so the interaction term
can be interpreted as the large n limit of an open string interaction term
where [, ] for open strings is the usual commutator coming from the u(n)
chan-paton factors. this is not so surprising since self-dual gravity can
be interpreted as the large n limit of self-dual yang-mills, suggesting that
the closed self-dual string can be interpreted as the large n limit of the
open self-dual string [21]. if such an interpretation also holds for the n=2
superconformal eld theory representing the ten-dimensional superstring,
it might shed light on the duality relating n=4 super-yang-mills with the
type iib superstring [22].
