abstract

in these lectures we review the properties of a boosted and rotated bound-
ary state and of a boundary state with an abelian gauge eld deriving from
it the dirac-born-infeld action and a newly constructed class of classical
solutions. we also review the construction of the boundary state for the sta-
ble non-bps state of type i theory corresponding to the perturbative state
present at the rst excited level of the so(32) heterotic string and trans-
forming according to the spinor representation of so(32).

1 introduction

dp-branes are classical solutions of the eqs. of motion of the low-energy string ef-
fective action 2, charged under a (p + 1)-form r-r eld, that correspond to new
non-perturbative bps states of string theory, break 1/2 supersymmetry, and are
required by t-duality in theories with open strings 3. they are characterized by
the fact that open strings have their end-points attached to them [3] and are con-
veniently described by a state of closed string theory called the boundary state. a
review of their properties and of the origin and of the construction of the boundary
state can be found in ref. [4]. for the sake of completeness we rewrite here its

tp = (cid:16)2(cid:17)3p

where the boundary states for the matter part and for the ghost degrees of freedom
are given by

|bmati = |bxi|b, i

|bgi = |bghi|bsgh, i

(1.2)

the ghost part of the boundary state can be found in eqs.(6.216) and (7.251)-
(7.253) of ref. [4]. here we will only write the explicit form of the matter part of
the boundary state. the part corresponding to the bosonic coordinate x is equal
to

where

s = (,ij)

verse directions of the brane.

the fermionic part of the matter boundary state is equal to

yt=1/2(cid:18)eitset(cid:19)|0i

in the ns-ns sector and to

|b, i =

a combination of them corresponding to the gso projection. the gso-projected

in ref. [4] we have reviewed the properties of the dp-branes, described by the
boundary state discussed above, and considered as static and rigid objects to which
open strings are attached. we have not discussed the fact that they can be boosted,
rotated and that the excitations of the attached open strings provide dynamical
degrees of freedom to them. in particular the massless excitations that have the
property of not changing the energy of the brane, can be interpreted as collective
coordinates of the dp-branes.
in these lectures we ll this gap by showing how
to construct a boosted [5] 4 and rotated boundary state and a boundary state
containing a constant abelian gauge eld living in the world volume of the brane [7].
we then show that some of those boundary states are related by t-duality. we then
use the boundary state with an external gauge eld in order, on the one hand, to
derive the born-infeld action and, on the other hand, to reconstruct, with a specic
choice of the external eld, newly found solutions [8, 9, 10] of the eqs. of motion
of the low-energy string eective action. finally we discuss the boundary state for
a toroidally compactied space-time and we use it for describing the properties of
stable non bps states recently discussed in the literature 5.

these lectures, that are partially based on the ph.d. thesis of antonella lic-
cardo, are organized as follows. in sect. 2 we discuss the properties of the boosted
and rotated boundary state. sect. 3 is devoted to the boundary state with an abelian
gauge eld. in sect. 4 we show how some of the previously discussed boundary states
are related by t-duality and we discuss the boundary state with transverse exci-
tations. in sect. 5 we show that, by choosing a particular form of the gauge eld,
we reproduce the (f, dp) bound states. sect. 6 is devoted to the construction of
the boundary state in the case of a compactied space-time and sect. 7 to the
construction of the boundary state for the stable non-bps particle of type i string
theory. finally in the appendix we summarize the properties of the ten-dimensional
 matrices.

2 boosted and rotated boundary state

in the introduction we have considered the boundary state corresponding to a static
dp-brane. in this section we want to extend this construction to a boosted and a
rotated one. it is easy to see that a boost along a longitudinal direction of a dp-
brane does not modify the boundary state explicitly written in the introduction as
expected from the poincare invariance of the classical solution along the longitudinal
directions of the brane. we can therefore concentrate us on a boost along one of
the transverse directions and let us call this direction k. the way to construct a
boosted boundary state is, as we have done in ref. [4], to start from the boundary

conditions for an open string attached to such a dp-brane and then translate them
into the language of the closed string channel through a conformal transformation
and a conformal rescaling (see ref. [4] for details).

the boundary conditions for an open string attached to a dp-brane boosted

with velocity v in the direction k are [12]

x i|=0 = yi

and i 6= k

x |=0 = 0

 = 1, ...., p

= 0

 (cid:16)x 0 + vx k(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0
1  v2 !(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0
  x k + vx 0

i = p + 1, ....d  1,
yk
1  v2

=

where ~y is a vector belonging to the space transverse to the dp-brane and therefore
has zero component along the time and the other world volume directions of the dp-
brane. in the closed channel the previous conditions translate into the following
equations that characterize the boosted boundary state |b, v, yi in the bosonic
string:
(2.14)

 = 1, ...., p

 x | =0|b, v, yi = 0

(cid:16)x i  yi(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) =0 |b, v, yi = 0

i = p + 1, ....d  1,

 (cid:16)x 0 + vx k(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) =0 |b, v, yi = 0
!(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) =0 |b, v, yi = 0
  (x k  yk) + vx 0
1  v2
 (cid:16)x k + vx 0(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) =0 |b, vi = 0

instead of the last equation we can also have a less restrictive one

and i 6= k

(2.13)

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

which corresponds to the case of a brane which is delocalized in the k direction.

the only overlap conditions that dier from those of the static case given in
ref. [4] are those in the directions of the boost, namely the time and the k directions
and they are equal to

(cid:16)p0 + v pk(cid:17)|b, v, yi = 0

qk + v q0

h(cid:16)0
n + e0
h(cid:16)k

(2.21)

(2.22)

n 6= 0

n 6= 0

let us now determine the explicit expression of the state |b, v, yi which fullls all
the previous conditions. for the zero mode part eq.(2.21) tells us that the boundary
state must contain a  function of the type

  qk + vq0  yk

1  v2 ! = 1  v2(qk + vq0  yk),

(2.23)

since the operator that acts on the boundary state in eq.(2.19) commutes with the
-function in eq.(2.23), in order to satisfy eq.(2.19), it is sucient to write the zero
mode part as follows:

1  v2(cid:16)qk + vq0  yk(cid:17)|p = 0i

(2.24)

it is easy to check that it satises both zero mode eqs.(2.19) and (2.21). let us
consider now the non zero modes part of the overlap conditions.
it is easy to
see that, in order to satisfy eqs.(2.20) and (2.22), the non-zero mode part of the
boundary state must have the following structure

yn=1(cid:16)e 1

n nm (v)en(cid:17)|0i|0ie

where the matrix m is obtained from the matrix s in eq.(1.4) by substituting its
elements (s00, s0k, sk0, skk) with the correspondent ones

m00 = mkk = 

1 + v2
1  v2

; m0k = mk0 = 

2v
1  v2

(2.26)

putting eqs.(2.24) and (2.25) together we get the nal expression for the boosted
boundary state:

(2.25)

(2.27)

|b, v, yi =

tp
2

d1yi=p+1,i6=jh(qi  yi)i1  v2 (qk + v q0  yk)
ep

n nm (v)en|0i|0ie|p = 0i .

n=1

we have xed the normalization factor to be tp/2 as in the static case, but the
overlap conditions alone do not allow to x it uniquely. in general the boundary
state in eq.(2.27) could include an arbitrary function n(v) of the physical velocity
v that can only be determined by requiring agreement between the calculation of
the interaction between two d-branes in the closed and open string channel. in this
case, however, we have an independent way of uniquely xing its normalization by
applying to the static boundary state |bxi in eq.(1.3) an operator that performs a
boost along the direction k transverse to the world volume of the d-brane

|b, y, wi = eiwkj 0

k |b, (w)yi ,

(2.28)

5

where w is related to the physical velocity v through the relation

v = tghw

(2.29)

(w)yk = ykcoshw is the boosted position of the d-brane and the generator of the
lorentz transformation is equal to

j  = qp  qp  i

xn=1(cid:16)a

n a

n  a

n a

n(cid:17) .
n +ea
n ea

with ann = n and ann = n with n > 0. after some algebra it can be seen

that the boosted boundary state in eq.(2.28) can be written in the following form

(2.30)

(2.31)

|b, y, w(v)i =

(qk + tghw q0  yk)

that exactly coincides with the one given in eq.(2.27), as it can be easily seen by
making use of eq.(2.29). in this way we have shown that the overall normalization
of the boosted boundary state in eq.(2.27) is correct.

the previous construction can be easily generalized to describe a rotated dp-
brane. obviously the conguration of a dp-brane embedded in a d-dimensional
space-time is invariant under rotations in the longitudinal space as well as in the
transverse space. this implies that the boundary state is invariant under rotations
in the planes (, ) or (i, j) ,   {0, ..., p} and i, j  {p + 1, ..., d  1}. this
means that, in order to get a new boundary state, we must consider a dp-brane
which is rotated with an angle  in one of the planes specied by the directions
(, k).

the open string attached to this brane at  = 0 satises the boundary conditions

x |=0 = 0

  {0, ...., p} and  6= 

x i|=0 = yi

= 0

 (cid:16)x  cos  + x k sin (cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0
(cid:16)x k cos   x  sin   yk cos (cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

i = p + 1, ....d  1,

and i 6= k
= 0

(2.32)

(2.33)

(2.34)

(2.35)

then the overlap conditions that the rotated boundary state must satisfy in the
directions dierent from (, k) are the same as in the unrotated case. on the other
hand along the directions (, k) we must impose the following conditions:

and

 (cid:16)x  cos  + x k sin (cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) =0 |b, , yi = 0
(cid:16)x k cos   x  sin   yk cos (cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) =0 |b, , yi = 0

6

(2.36)

(2.37)

that in terms of the oscillators become:

(cid:16)p cos  + pk sin (cid:17)|b, , yi = 0
n(cid:17)i|b, , yi = 0
n(cid:17) + tan  (cid:16)k
n(cid:17)i|b, , yi = 0
n(cid:17)  tan (cid:16)

n + e

h(cid:16)k
n  ek

n + ek
n  e

n 6= 0

n 6= 0

proceeding as in the previous case it is easy to see that the rotated boundary state
has the following form:

|b, , yi =

tp

d1yi=p+1,i6=kh(qi  yi)i (cos  qk  sin  q  yk cos )
ep

n nm ()en|0i|0ie|p = 0i

where in this case the matrix m is obtained from the matrix s appearing in eq.(1.4)
by substituting its elements (s, sk, sk, skk) with the correspondent elements

m() = m(kk) = cos 2 ; m(0k) = m(k0) = sin 2

(2.43)

the previous boundary state for a rotated dp-brane can again also be obtained by
acting on the boundary state given in eq.(1.3) with the rotation operator

|b, y, i = eikj 

k |b, ()yi ,

(2.44)

where ()yk = yk cos  is the rotated position of the d-brane and j  is dened
in eq.(2.30). the previous considerations can be easily extended to the fermionic
coordinate obtaining the boosted boundary state in the case of superstring. we will
not present here its detailed derivation as in the bosonic case, but we write only its
nal form. we get

|b, i =

in the r-r sector. the matrix m is obtained from s as in eq.(2.26). the zero mode
contribution |b, i(0) is given by

|b, i(0) =

at the end of this section we write the interaction between two branes moving with
velocity v relative to each other originally performed in ref. [12] in the open string
channel and then reproduced in ref. [5] in the closed string channel. the total
contribution of the ns-ns sector is given by:

 is equal to the number of mixed n-d boundary conditions for the open strings with
their endpoints on the two branes and the functions fi can be found in eqs.(9.282)
and (9.283) of ref. [4]. for the sake of simplicity we give the r-r contribution in
the case of equal branes. in this case we get

summing the two contribution we get the following expression for equal d branes:

3 boundary state with an external eld

until now we have considered the branes as static or rigidly moving objects, a
sort of geometrical hyperplanes having open strings attached with their endpoints.
we have completely neglected the dynamics of the open strings attached to the
d branes. in this section we will consider those excitations. we are in particular
interested to the zero mode (massless) excitations that do not change the energy of
the brane and that correspond to its collective coordinates. in absence of chan pa-
ton factors the massless excitations of an open string are described by a u(1) gauge
eld. in presence of a dp-brane the ten-dimensional gauge vector eld splits into
a longitudinal vector eld living in the world volume of the brane and a transverse
part correponding to d  p  1 scalar elds that have the physical interpretation
of coordinates of the brane. in this section we will neglect the scalar elds corre-
sponding to the transverse components of the gauge eld and concentrate on the
construction of the boundary state describing a dp-brane with an abelian gauge
eld living on its world volume. then we will use it for deriving the dirac-born-
infeld (dbi) action with the inclusion of the wess-zumino term, that is the action
describing the low-energy dynamics of a dp-brane.

in order to construct the boundary state with an abelian eld on it we follow the
same procedure that we have followed in the previous section. we start looking at
the boundary conditions of an open string stretching between two dp-branes with a
gauge eld on it and then we translate these conditions into those for the boundary
state with a gauge eld on it.

let us start considering the bosonic string. an open string interacts with a
gauge eld through the pointlike charges located at its endpoints. therefore the
action for an open string interacting with an abelian gauge eld contains besides
the free string action also a term describing this interaction that occurs only at the
endpoints  = 0 and  = :

s =z dz 

0

d(cid:26) 1

4

[( x)2  (x)2]  [()  (  )] x a(x)(cid:27) . (3.54)

for the sake of simplicity we have taken the two charges located at the endpoints
of the string to have the same absolute value and opposite sign. the eqs. of motion
and the boundary conditions are obtained by varying the previous action. one gets:

s = 

1

2z dz 

0

d{(2

 x  2

x)x  + (xx )+

+ 2[()  (  )](x  a(x) +  x a(x))}

(3.55)

requiring this variation to be zero we obtain, together with the equations of mo-
tion that are of course unchanged with respect to the free case, also the following
boundary constraint

1

2z dnx   x  fo x |=

=0 = 0

(3.56)

9

where we have dened a = 2a and f =  a   a. we will now assume
that the gauge eld is non zero only in the directions of the world volume of the
brane, while it is constant along the transverse ones: ai = const. this means that
eq.(3.56) is satised if we impose

(x + f(x) x )|=0, = 0

(3.57)

along the world volume of the brane, while the transverse coordinates still satisfy

x i|=0 = yi

i = p + 1, ..., d  1

(3.58)

translating these conditions in the closed channel we get the constraints that the
boundary state must satisfy to describe a dp-brane with an external eld

( x + f(x)x )| =0|bxi = 0

(x i| =0  yi)|bxi = 0

i = p + 1, ..., d  1

(3.59)

(3.60)

substituting in the previous equation the mode expansion we get the overlap con-
ditions in terms of the oscillators. since they can be easily solved only in the case
of a constant f in the following we limit ourselves to a constant eld 6. in this
case eqs.(3.59) and (3.60) become:



qi|bxi = yi|bxi
no|bxi = 0
n + ( 1l  f )
e

n)|bxi = 0

p|bxi = 0 ;
n( 1l + f )

n  ei
(i

(3.61)

with n 6= 0. they are satised by the following boundary state

(3.63)

and np(f ) is a normalization factor depending on the external eld that we will
determine later. proceeding in an analogous way we can get the overlap conditions
for the fermionic oscillators

where

(3.71)

(3.72)

(3.73)

where the symbol ;
; means that we have to expand the exponential and then
antisymmetrize the indices of the -matrices. the boundary state for the matter
elds is then obtained by inserting in the rst equation in (1.2) the bosonic boundary
state in eq.(3.62) and the fermionic one given in eq.(3.65) for the ns sector and
in eq.(3.66) for the r sector. the complete boundary state is nally obtained by
performing the appropriate gso-projections 7 on the state given in eq.(1.1) where
the ghost contribution is unchanged with respect to the case with f = 0.

analogously we get also the conjugate boundary state

the coupling of a dp-brane with the massless elds of the closed superstring
can be obtained by saturating the boundary state with the states corresponding to
those elds. in the following we will show that the structure of those couplings is
the same as that obtained from the dbi action and actually the comparison with
what comes from the dbi action allows us to x the normalization constants np(f )
and k(f ) appearing in the boundary state. we want to stress, however, that the
normalization constants np(f ) and k(f ) could also be independently determined
by requiring that the interaction between two branes be the same if we compute it
in the open or in the closed string channel.

the coupling of a dp-brane with a specic massless eld  can be computed
by saturating the boundary state with the corresponding eld h| (h| can be
hh|,hb|,h| corresponding respectively to the graviton, antisymmetric tensor
and dilaton or hc(n)| corresponding to a r-r state). by proceeding in this way we
get the following couplings:

for the r-r states. the details of these calculations are given in ref. [16]. the
trace in eq.(3.77) can be easily computed by expanding the exponential term. the
rst term of the expansion of the exponential gives the coupling of the boundary
state with a (p + 1)-form potential of the r-r sector and is given by

jc(p+1) =

2 tp np(f )k(f )

(3.78)

where we have used that for d = 10 the  matrices are 3232 dimensional matrices,
and thus t r( 1l) = 32 and that only the term with n = p + 1 gives a non-vanishing
contribution. here 0...p indicates the completely antisymmetric tensor on the d
brane world-volume 8. from eq. (3.78) we can immediately deduce that the charge
of a dp-brane with respect to the r-r potential c(p+1) is

2tp np(f )k(f )

(3.79)

the next term in the expansion of the exponential of eq. (3.77) yields the coupling
of the dp brane with a (p  1)-form potential which is given by

where we have explicitly used the fact that only the term with n = p1 gives a non-

the higher order terms generated by the exponential which describe the interactions
of the d-brane with potential forms of lower degree. all these couplings can be
encoded in the following term

c1...n is the pullback of the n-form potential on the d-brane world-volume. the
square bracket in eq. (3.81) means that in expanding the exponential form one has
to pick up only the terms of total degree (p + 1), which are then integrated over the
(p + 1)-dimensional world-volume.

the couplings of a dp-brane with the massless states of closed superstring that
have been extracted from the boundary state can be compared with those computed
from its low energy eective action. the low energy eective action describing a dp-
brane consists of a sum of two terms. the rst one is the so called dirac-born-infeld
action, which in the string frame is given by

sdbi =

 zvp+1

dp+1 er dethg + b + fi .

(3.83)

where we are considering only its bosonic part, 22 = (2)7()4g2
s , (gs being the
string coupling) and g and b are respectively the pullbacks of the space-time
metric and of the ns-ns antisymmetric tensor on the d-brane world volume:

g = x x g(x)

8our convention is that 0...p = 0...p = 1.

b = x x b(x)

(3.84)

notice that the action in eq.(3.83) is written using the string metric g, and should
be considered together with the gravitational bulk action in the string frame

(h3)2(cid:21)

(3.85)

where h3 [fn+1] is the eld strenght corresponding to the ns-ns [r-r] 2-form [n-
form] potential. in order to compare the couplings described by this action with
the ones obtained from the boundary state, it is rst necessary to rewrite sdbi in
the einstein frame. in fact, like any string amplitude computed with the operator
formalism, also the couplings jh, j and jb are written in the einstein frame.
furthermore, it is also convenient to introduce canonically normalized elds

g = e/2g

,  = 2  , b = 2be/2 .

(3.86)

inserting these elds in eq. (3.83) we get

sdbi = 

tp

 z dp+1 e(3p)/(22)r dethg + 2b + fe/2i .

(3.87)

by expanding the metric around the at background as

g =  + h =  + 2h

(3.88)

and keeping only the terms which are linear in the elds h,  and b one gets from
eq.(3.87) the following expression:

comparing these couplings with those obtained in eqs.(3.74), (3.75) and (3.76) we
can x the normalization constant np(f ) to be

np(f ) =qdet( + f )

(3.90)

therefore the normalization factor of the boundary state turns out to be propor-
tional to the dirac-born-infeld lagrangian.

the second term is the wess-zumino action which is given by

sw z = pzvp+1

(3.92)

(3.93)

this has exactly the same structure as in eq.(3.81) obtained by saturating the
boundary state with the r-r state.

comparing eq.(3.91) with eq.(3.81) we can x the other normalization constant

to be

and we can see that the coupling of a dp-brane with the r-r (p+1)-form potential
is given by

this is exactly the r-r charge carried by the p-brane classical solution of the low-
energy string eective action in ten dimensions. in conclusion we have explicitly
shown that by projecting the boundary state |bi with an external eld onto the
massless states of the closed string spectrum, one can reconstruct the linear part of
the low-energy eective action of a dp brane. this is the sum of the dirac-born-
infeld part (3.89) and the wess-zumino term (3.81) which are produced respectively
by the ns-ns and the r-r components of the boundary state.

for the sake of completeness we conclude this section by giving the asymptotic
behaviour of the elds generated by a dp-brane with an arbitrary external eld on
it, determined by computing the quantity

hpx|d|bi

(3.94)

where d is the closed superstring propagator and px are the projectors of the closed
superstring massless sector that can be found in ref. [16]. for the massless ns-ns

from the previous expressions we can reconstruct the long distance behaviour

4 t-duality and transverse excitations

it is by now well known9 that, compactifying d  p  1 directions and perform-
ing on them a t-duality transformation, the abelian gauge potential a that lives
on a d9-brane and that describes the massless excitations of an open string with
nn boundary conditions in all directions is transformed as follows:
its longitudi-
nal components (those along the directions in which no t-duality transformation
is performed) give rise to a gauge eld a living on the world volume of a dp-
brane, while its transverse components (those along the directions transformed by
t-duality) become the coordinates of the dp-brane. as the original gauge eld,
that is related to the massless excitations of an open string, corresponds to the
collective coordinates of the d9-brane, so after the t-duality transformation both
its longitudinal components and its transverse ones, that become the coordinates
of the dp-brane, correspond to the collective coordinates of the dp-brane.

in the following we want to see how this conclusion can be reached from the
point of view of the boundary state. to this purpose let us compare the overlap
conditions for a boundary state describing a dp-brane with an external electric eld,

9see for instance sect. 4 of ref. [4]

16

that for simplicity we take with only one non vanishing component f 0k (here k is
one of the longitudinal directions), with those for the boundary state describing a
d(p  1)-brane boosted in the transverse direction k discussed in the section 2. in
other words the direction k is one of the longitudinal directions of the dp-brane,
while is one of the transverse directions of the boosted d(p  1)-brane. remember
that a t-duality transformation in a longitudinal direction transforms a dp-brane
into a d(p 1)-brane. therefore if we perform it on the dp-brane that is described
by the boundary state dened through the overlap conditions given in the eq.(3.59)
by remembering that, as discussed in ref. [4], t-duality acts on the coordinate x k
by changing its  derivative (dirichlet-like boundary conditions in the open channel)
with minus its  derivative (neumann-like boundary conditions), we obtain that
eq.(3.59) becomes:

( x 0  fk
(x k  f (x)0

0 x k)| =0|bi = 0
kx 0)|t=0|bi = 0

f0

k = fk

0 = v

(4.101)

(4.102)

(4.103)

by making the identication

the previous equations exactly reproduce eqs.(2.15) and (2.18). we can therefore
conclude that the boundary state for a dp-brane with an external electric eld
having only a non zero component in the direction k is equivalent, through a t-
duality transformation along the direction x k, to the boundary state of a d(p 1)-
brane boosted and delocalized along the transverse direction k.
analogously it can be shown that the boundary state for a dp-brane with an
external magnetic eld having fk as the only non vanishing component ( 6=
0 and k 6= 0 are both longitudinal components) is transformed by a t-duality
transformation on the coordinate x k to that of a d(p  1)-brane rotated in the
(, k) plane and delocalized in the direction x k. in this case in fact from eq.(3.59)
we get

( x   fk
(x k  f

 x k)| =0|bi = 0
kx )|t=0|bi = 0

(4.104)

(4.105)

then by making the identication
f

(4.106)
the previous equations reproduce the overlap conditions for a d(p 1)-brane which
is rotated in the (, k) plane and delocalized in the direction x k, that are given in
eq.(2.36) and in the equation obtained by taking the  derivative of eq.(2.37).

 = tan 

k =  fk

this result shows that after a t-duality transformation the t-dualized compo-
nents of the gauge eld u(1) are correctly reinterpreted as the transverse coordinates
of a d(p 1)-brane. in fact if we consider a boost in the direction k and start with
x k = 0 we get



x 0 = x0
1v2
1v2  0x k = v
x k = vx0

17

(4.107)

comparing eqs.(4.107) with eq.(4.103) we get

f0

k = 0x k  ak  (x)k

(4.108)

analogously considering a rotation in the (, k) plane and starting with x k = 0 we
get

( x  = x  cos 
x k = x  sin   x k =  tan 

f

k = x k  ak  x k

(4.109)

(4.110)

that compared with eq. (4.106) gives

showing that the transverse components of the gauge elds become the transverse
collective coordinates of the dp-brane. notice that in deriving both eqs.(4.108) and
(4.110) we have assumed that ka0 and ka are equal zero. this is a consequence
of the fact that the d(p  1)-brane is delocalized in the k direction.
since in the static gauge the p+1 coordinates of the world volume of a dp-brane
can be xed to be x  = , a dp-brane is described by the transverse coordinate x i
and by the gauge eld a corresponding to a total of 10 degrees of freedom of which
only 8 are physical. turning on a longitudinal gauge eld in the boundary state as
we have done in eqs.(3.62), (3.65) and (3.66) we have included in the description
of the dp-brane only some of its excitations. following the previous discussion we
can also include a dependence on its transverse coordinates and therefore have a
boundary state depending not only on a longitudinal gauge eld, but also on the
transverse coordinates of the dp-brane. from the previous discussion it is then
immediately clear how this can be done: we must start from the boundary state of
a d9-brane in which 9 p directions are compactied and then perform a t-duality
transformation along all of them. this can be easily done and we arrive at the
following bosonic boundary state:

1

t9

|bxi =

2 qdet( + ef) epn=1
where m( f , x) is the following 10  10 matrix
m( f , x) =  [(1  ef )(1 + ef )1]
2x i(1 + ef )1 

n nm ( f ,x)en|0i|0ie|k = 0i
 i + x ix j(1 + ef )1  !
2x i(1 + ef )1 

and where we have dened

(4.111)

ef  = f  + x ixi

the expression of the matrix m( f , x) has been determined by observing that
under a t-duality transformation over (9  p) coordinates the exponential factor
appearing in the boundary state changes as follows
n + j

where ,   (0, ...p) and i, j  (p + 1, ....9  p). then in terms of the matrix ap-
pearing in the exponential factor of the boundary state a t-duality transformation
simply acts by changing the sign of all the columns corresponding to the directions
aected by the t-duality transformation.

saturating the previous boundary state with the various massless elds of the
bosonic sector of the closed superstring we reproduce the couplings that one can
read from the dbi action, for the case x j 6= 0 , j which are in fact given by
the following expression

5 (f,dp) bound states from the boundary state

in this section we are going to show that the boundary state with an external
electric eld on it can be used to obtain the long distance behaviour of the various
elds describing the bound state (f, dp) formed by a fundamental string and a dp-
brane [16]. this type of bound state is a generalization of the dyonic string solution
of schwarz [17] and has been recently discussed from the supergravity point of view
[8, 9, 10]. the (f, dp) bound state can be obtained from a dp-brane by turning on
an electric eld f on its world volume. with no loss in generality we can choose f
to have non vanishing components only in the directions x 0 and x 1 so that it can
be represented by the following (p + 1)  (p + 1) matrix




0 f

using this expression in eq. (3.63) one can easily see that the longitudinal part of
the matrix m appearing in the boundary state is given by

.

(5.1)

(5.2)

while the transverse part of m is simply minus the identity in the remaining (9 p)
directions. furthermore, using eq.(5.1) one nds

 det(cid:16) + f(cid:17) = 1  f 2 .

since we want to describe congurations of branes with arbitrary r-r charge, we
multiply the entire boundary state by an overall factor of x. later we will see that
the consistency of the entire construction will require that x be an integer, and also
that the electric eld strength f cannot be arbitrary.

let us now begin our analysis by studying the projection in eq.(3.94) in the
ns-ns sector. using eqs. (3.95)-(3.97), we nd the long-distance behavior of the
ns-ns massless elds generated by the (f,dp) bound state. for the dilaton we get

for the antisymmetric kalb-ramond eld we nd that, since the matrix m is
symmetric except in the block corresponding to the 0 and 1 directions (see eq. (5.2)),
its only non-vanishing component is b01 whose long-distance behavior is given by

finally, the components of the metric tensor are

let us now turn to the r-r sector. in this case, after the insertion of the closed
string propagator, we have to saturate the r-r boundary state with the projectors
on the various r-r massless elds that can be found in ref. [16]. due to the
structure of the r-r component of the boundary state describing the bound state
(f,dp), it is not dicult to realize that the only projectors that can give a non
vanishing result are those corresponding to a (p + 1)-form and to a (p  1)-form
with all indices along the world-volume directions. in particular, we nd that the
long distance behavior of the (p + 1)-form is given by

c01p  hp (c)

01p| d |bir = p

x .

(5.7)

similarly, given our choice of the external eld, we nd that the only non vanishing
component of the (p  1)-form emitted by the boundary state is c23p whose long-
distance behavior turns out to be
c23p  hp (c)

23p| d |bir = p

x f .

(5.9)

notice that if p = 1 this expression has to be interpreted as the long-distance
behavior of the r-r scalar which is usually denoted by .

in all our previous analysis, the two parameters x and f that appear in the
boundary state seem to be arbitrary. however, this is not so at a closer inspection.
in fact, they are strictly related to the electric charges of the (f,dp) conguration
under the kalb-ramond eld and the r-r (p + 1)-form potential. it is well-known
that these charges must obey the dirac quantization condition, i.e.
they must
be integer multiples of the fundamental unit of (electric) charge of a p-dimensional
extended object p. in our notations this quantization condition amounts to impose
that the coecients of p
in eqs. (5.5) and (5.7) be integer numbers. this
implies that

with n and m two integers. while the restriction on x had to be expected from the
very beginning because x simply represents the number of dp branes (and hence of
boundary states) that form the bound state, the restriction on the external eld f
is less trivial. in fact, from eq. (5.9) we see that f must be of the following form

f = 

m

n2 + m2

.

(5.10)

this is precisely the same expression that appears in the analysis of ref. [18] on the
dyonic string congurations, and is also consistent with the results of ref. [8, 9, 10].
using eq. (5.9), we can now rewrite the long distance behavior of the massless
elds produced by a (f,dp) bound state in a more suggestive way. in doing so, we
also perform the fourier transformation for d = 10 to work in conguration space.
for later convenience, we also introduce the following notations

m,n = m2 + n2

(5.11)

then, using eq. (5.4) and assuming for the time being that the dilaton has vanishing
vacuum expectation value, after some elementary steps, we obtain that the long-
distance behavior of the dilaton is

 = 2    

n2 (p  3) + 2 m2

(5.12)

where qp can be found in ref. [16].

since we are going to compare our results with the standard supergravity de-
scription of d-branes, we have reintroduced the eld  which diers from the canon-
ically normalized dilaton  by a factor of 2  (see eq.(3.86)). similarly, recalling
that g =  + 2 h, from eq. (5.6) we nd

emitted by the (f,dp) bound state. proceeding as in ref. [16] where we have
assumed that the exact solution can be written in terms of powers of the usual
harmonic function

solution corresponding to the (f, dp) bound state the dilaton is

(5.19)

the metric is

ds2 = h3/4 h(p1)/8(cid:20)(cid:16)dx0(cid:17)2

in writing this solution we have assumed that all elds except the metric have
vanishing asymptotic values. this explains why we have subtracted the 1 in the
last four equations. our solution exactly agrees with the one recently derived in
ref. [9] from the supergravity point of view 10. moreover, eq.(5.24) can be shown
to exactly agree with the axion eld of the dyonic string solution of schwarz [17] in
the case of vanishing asymptotic background values for the scalars (0 = 0 = 0).
one can compute the vacuum amplitude between two boundary states at a distance
r from each other. this calculation has been performed in ref. [16] where it has
been found that the two branes do not interact.

we can therefore conclude that the boundary state with an external electric eld
(eq.(5.1)), really provides the complete conformal description of the bps bound
states formed by fundamental strings and dp-branes.

6 compactied boundary state

in this section we construct the boundary state describing a dp-brane which has
all directions compactied on circles. from it, by decompactifying some directions,
we can obtain the one in which only certain directions are compactied. for the
sake of simplicity we take radii all equal to r, but from the formulas that we will
get, it will be trivial to extend our results to arbitrary radii. before we write the
boundary state we rst want to introduce a convenient notation. in the compactied
case it is convenient to introduce position and momentum operators separately
for momentum and winding degrees of freedom requiring for them the following
commutation relations:

[q

w, p

w] = i

;

[q

n, p

n] = i

(6.25)

10actually, in comparing our results with those of ref. [9], we nd total agreement except for the
overall sign in the kalb-ramond 2-form. our sign however agrees with the dyonic string solution
of schwarz [17] when we put p = 1.

23

where the subscripts n and w correpond respectively to the momentum and to
the winding degrees of freedom and the other commutators are all vanishing. by
denoting with |n, wi an eigenstate of the two momentum operators

p
n|n, wi =

n
r |n, wi

;

p
w|n, wi =

wr


|n, wi

(6.26)

it is easy to convince oneself that the previous state can also be written as follows

|n, wi = eiqnn/reiqwwr/|0, 0i

;

(6.27)

where |0, 0i is the state with zero momentum and winding number. the state in
eq.(6.27) is normalized as:

hn, w|n, wi =  nnww

where  is the self-dual volume that has the following properties:

 = 2r if r   ;

 =

2

r

if r  0

(6.28)

(6.29)

let us use this formalism to write the boundary state for the compactied case. in
this case the part corresponding to the non-zero modes is unchanged, while the one
corresponding to the zero modes of the bosonic coordinate becomes [19]:

|i = np

py=0"xw

ei(q

wy)wr/# d1yi=p+1

xni

ei(qi

nyi)ni/r|n = 0, w = 0i

(6.30)

where the parameters y and yi correspond respectively to wilson lines turned
on along the world volume of the brane and to the position of the brane in the
transverse directions.

the previous boundary state satises the overlap conditions:

(cid:16)e i(r/)q
n/r  e iyi/r(cid:17) |i = pi
(cid:16)e iqi

w  e i(r/)y(cid:17) |i = p
w|i = 0

n|i = 0

,  = 0 . . . p

(6.31)

,

i = p + 1 . . . 9  p .

(6.32)

and

the overall normalization can be determined by comparing the calculation of
the brane interaction done in the closed and open string channels. in this way one
gets the following relation [19]:


4

n 2

p

d =

v c1
2

(6.33)

where

v = (2r)p+1  2

r !dp1

;

24

c1 = (2)d(2)d/2

(6.34)

from eq.(6.33) we get

np =s 2v c1

(2r)d (2r)dp1"(cid:18) 2r

 (cid:19)d/2

(2r)p+1d#

(6.35)

after some calculation it is easy to see that the part of np that is not contained in
the square bracket just reproduces the normalization of the boundary state in the
uncompactied case and therefore we get:

tp

2 "(cid:18)2r

 (cid:19)d/2

(2r)p+1d#

(6.36)

np =

where tp is dened in eq.(1.1). let us show now that the previous normalization
factor np reduces to tp/2 in the decompactied limit. in the decompactication
limit (r  ) one can easily check the following relations:

and

ei(q

(6.37)

(6.38)

where in the rst relation we have taken into account that in the limit r   only
the term with w = 0 survives and in the second relation we have substituted in the
decompactication limit a sum with an integral by introducing k = n/r. using
the two previous relations and the rst equation in (6.29) it is easy to see that the
normalization factor reduces to tp/2 that is the correct one in the decompactied
limit. if we decompactify only the time and the transverse directions the zero mode
contribution in eq.(6.30) becomes

7 stable non bps states in type i theory

in this section, following the analysis of sen [20, 21, 22, 23, 24] and the approach of
frau et al. [25], we construct the boundary state corresponding to the stable non-
bps particle of type i theory that is related through the heterotic-type i duality to
the state that belongs to the rst excited level of the so(32) heterotic theory and
that transforms according to the spinor representation of so(32). let us start by

25

reminding some properties of the so(32) heterotic string and of its duality with
type i theory. the heterotic string is a theory of closed oriented strings with a local
gauge invariance in ten dimensions. it can be considered as a combination of the
bosonic string and the superstring. in fact it has a left sector, that is the same as
the left sector of a bosonic string in which 16 of the 26 coordinates are compactied
and that is described by a lefthanded coordinate x (  ) where  = 0 . . . 25 and a
righthanded one, that is the same as the one of the superstring and that is described
by the righthanded coordinates fx ( + ) and e( + ) with  = 0 . . . 9. we can
combine fx ( + ) from the righthanded sector with the rst ten coordinates of
the lefthanded sector x (  ) to obtain the usual closed string coordinate:

x (, ) =

1

2(cid:16)fx ( + ) + x (  )(cid:17)  = 0 . . . 9 .

(7.40)

in addition we are left with 16 compact righthanded coordinates x a(  ) with
a = 1 . . . 16 and of course with the lefthanded fermionic coordinate e( + ) with
 = 0 . . . 9.

the mass spectrum of the heterotic string in the ns sector is determined by the

mass-shell conditions

(cid:16)l0  1(cid:17)|i =(cid:16)el0 

1

2(cid:17)|i = 0 ,

(7.41)

where we have used the values of the intercept of the bosonic theory (a = 1) in the
left sector and of the ns superstring (a = 1/2) in the right sector. by expanding
el0 in modes, one easily nds from the second equality in eq. (7.41) that the mass
m of a state is given by

(7.42)

m 2 =

4

(cid:16)fn 

1

2(cid:17)

where fn is the total number of right moving oscillators. from the rst equality of
eq. (7.41) one can derive a generalized level matching condition which relates fn

to the total number of left moving oscillators n that are present in a given state.
this condition reads as follows

1
2

= n +

1

2xa

fn +

(pa)2 ,

(7.43)

where we have conveniently measured the internal momenta pa in units of 2.
additional restrictions come from the gso projection that one has to perform
in the right sector of the theory in order to have a consistent model. the gso

left occupation number n is always integer as in the bosonic theory, in order to
be able to satisfy eq. (7.43), the internal momenta pa have to be quantized. in

projection on ns states selects only half-integer occupation numbers fn . since the
particular, the quantity pa(pa)2 must be an even number. this condition implies

that the internal coordinates x a must be compactied on an even 16-dimensional

26

lattice. the modular invariance of the one-loop partition function requires that this
lattice be also self-dual. it can be shown that there exist only two 16-dimensional
lattices satisfying both these properties: the root lattice of e8  e8, and a z2
sublattice of the weight lattice of so(32). since we are interested in the heterotic
theory with gauge group so(32) here we will focus only on the second lattice which
is denoted by 16 and is dened by
1
2

ni  2z (7.44)
(n1, . . . , n16)  16
the lowest states of the ns sector are massless and, because of eq.(7.42), all such

2(cid:17)  16  xi
states must have fn = 1/2, so that their right-moving part is simply ei

i = 2, ..., 9 labels the directions transverse to the light-cone. on the other hand,
the level matching condition in eq.(7.43) requires that

and (cid:16)n1 +

, . . . , n16 +

1

n +

1

2xa (cid:16)pa(cid:17)2

= 1

(7.45)

this condition can be satised either by taking n = 1 and pa = 0, or by taking
n = 0 and the momenta pa to be of the form p = (1,1, 0, . . . , 0) (or any
permutation thereof with only both plus or both minus signs). the rst choice gives
16 states a
1|k; 0i, while the second one contributes with 16  15  2 = 480 states
|k; pi. altogether we have 496 massless states that carry a spacetime vector index
from the right-moving part and span the adjoint representation 496 of so(32).
those states correspond to the gauge elds of so(32). at the massless level we

are given by

have 64 more bosonic states which correspond to fn = 1/2, n = 1 and pa = 0, and
(7.46)
where the indices i, j run along the transverse directions 2,   , 9. these states are
singlets with respect to the gauge group but are space-time tensors. decomposing
them into irreducible components, we get a graviton, a dilaton and an antisymmetric
two-index tensor. in conclusion, the bosonic massless states of the heterotic theory
are in the following representations

1|k; 0i  ej

1/2|eki

i

(1; 1)  (35; 1)  (28; 1)  (8; 496)

(7.47)

where in each term the two labels refer to the lorentz and gauge group respectively.
by analyzing the r sector, one nds an equal number of fermionic massless states
that complete the n = 1 supersymmetric multiplets.

let us now consider the rst excited level of the ns sector that consists of states

with fn = 3/2 and mass squared m 2 = 4/. the states satisfying the condition
fn = 3/2 are the following

(7.48)

ei
3/2|eki  8 states
1ej
ei
1/2ej
ei

1/2|eki  64 states
1/2e

1/2|eki  56 states

27

(7.49)

(7.50)

by putting together the antisymmetric part of eq.(7.49) together with the states in
eq.(7.50) we obtain a massive three-form transforming according to the represen-
tation 84 of the lorentz group, while the remaining states transform together as a
symmetric two-index tensor in the representation 44. the level matching condition
(7.43) imposes the constraint

n +

1

2xa (cid:16)pa(cid:17)2

= 2

(7.51)

there are 73,764 ways to satisfy this requirement! the complete list of the cor-
responding states can be found for example on pag. 342 of ref. [26] where it is
shown that they transform as scalars, spinors, second-rank antisymmetric tensors,
fourth-rank antisymmetric tensors and second-rank symmetric traceless tensors of
so(32). here we focus on the 215 states that are obtained by taking in eq.(7.51)
n = 0 and momenta pa of the form ( 1
2 ) with an even number of plus
signs. notice that these momenta dene a point in the lattice 16, since they satisfy
the second condition of eq.(7.44), and correspond to the spinor representation of
so(32). by combining these left modes with the right-moving ones of eqs. (7.48)
- (7.50), we then obtain bosonic states transforming as

2, . . . , 1

2 , 1

(44; 215)  (84; 215) .

(7.52)

analyzing the rst excited level of the r sector, one can nd 128 massive fermionic
states which transform in the spinor representation of so(32) and complete the
n = 1 supersymmetry multiplets. thus, altogether the spinors of so(32) appear
with 256 dierent polarizations, 128 bosonic and 128 fermionic, corresponding to a
long multiplet of the n = 1 supersymmetry algebra in ten dimensions. these states
are not bps, but, nevertheless, stable. in fact, since there are no spinors of so(32)
at the massless level, they are the lighest states with these quantum numbers and
therefore cannot decay.

there is by now a strong evidence that the so(32) heterotic string is dual to the
type i theory [27] 11. they have the same spectrum of massless states, their low-
energy eective actions can be transformed into each other through the following
transformations on the metric and the dilaton:

gh

 = ei gi


,

h = i

.

(7.53)

since the second equation in (7.53) implies that the strong coupling limit of one
theory is related to the weak coupling limit of the other theory, the fact that the
perturbative massive spectra of the two theories are totally dierent from each other
is not in contradiction with the fact that the two theories are non-perturbatively
equivalent. for instance in the type i theory all states transform according to the
adjoint representation of the gauge group so(32), while in the heterotic string the

11see also the second paper in ref. [11].

28

perturbative states transform according to all the representations of so(32). but,
if we have in one of the two theory some state that cannot decay, then we expect
it to be present in both theories at all values of the coupling constant. identifying
such states in both theories is a check of duality. for instance an heterotic string
wrapped around a compact dimension breaks 1/2 of supersymmetry and is charged
under the antisymmetric 2-form of the gravitational multiplet, the charge being
simply its winding number. this is a bps conguration and should also appear in
type i theory. a natural candidate is the d string of type i theory that is charged
with respect to the r-r 2-form of type i that corresponds under the strong/weak
duality to the antisymmetric 2-form potential of the gravitational multiplet of the
heterotic string. but, since an heterotic string is a bps conguration with tension
equal to

1

2

h =

it should match the tension of the d string of type i theory given by

d1 =

1

2gi

(7.54)

(7.55)

in fact, if we use the metric relation in eq.(7.53), we see that the two tensions in
eqs.(7.54) and (7.55) transform into each other. the identication between d string
of type i and the fundamental heterotic so(32) string can be tested at a deeper
level by showing that the world sheet structure of a (wrapped) heterotic string
is exactly reproduced by the world-sheet dynamics on a (wrapped) d string [27].
moreover, if the heterotic so(32) string theory is dual to the type i theory, then
we must be able to nd in the latter one a description of the massive stable state
transforming according to the 215 spinor representation of the heterotic so(32)
theory. in heterotic string units its mass is given by:

mh =

2


f (gh)

,

f (0) = 1

(7.56)

by going to type i units we expect its mass to be given by:

mi =

2


f (gi)

,

f(g) = f (1/g)

(7.57)

that in the weak coupling regime of type i theory becomes:

mi =

2


f(gi  0)

(7.58)

where f (0) cannot be determined in type i perturbation theory.

from the heterotic so(32) point of view the stable state is just an excitation of
the fundamental string. therefore in the type i theory we expect that a d string
should be involved in the description of this state. but a d string alone is not be

29

sucient because, on the one hand, it is a bps conguration and on the other hand
it is dual to the fundamental heterotic string with winding number equal to 1, while
the stable state is not charged under the gravitational 2-form of the heterotic string
and therefore should be dual to a conguration of type i theory that is neutral
under the 2-form rr potential of type i theory. because of this the next simple
possibility is that the stable state is a combination of a d string and an anti d
string:

|a >= |d1 > +|d1 >

.

(7.59)

but such a system is unstable because has tachyonic open string excitations. this
can be easily seen by noticing that a change in sign in front of the r-r spin struc-
ture, necessary in order to describe an anti d string in the closed string channel,
corresponds to a sign change of the ns(1)f spin structure in the open string
channel. as a consequence the ns sector of the open strings of the systems 1  1
and 1 1 contains only states that are odd under (1)f and their lowest states are
tachyons described in the 1 picture by the states:

|k >1 11

,

|k >1 11

,

(7.60)

where we have introduced the following notation for the open string connecting d
strings and anti d strings:

0 0 !
for a 1-1 string  11 =  1 0
for a 1-1 string  11 =  0 0
0 1 !
for a 1-1 string  11 =  0 1
0 0 !
for a 1-1 string  11 =  0 0
1 0 !

(7.61)

(7.62)

(7.63)

(7.64)

the linear combination of the two tachyons in eq.(7.60) that is even under the 
projection corresponding to the sum of the two states in eq.(7.60) will survive in
the type i theory. in conclusion in type i theory the state in eq.(7.59) is unstable.
but, even if we would nd a way of eliminating the tachyon state, we will be left
with the problem that the state in eq.(7.59) cannot represent the stable state of the
heterotic string because both the d string and the anti d string carry the quantum
number of the spinor representation of so(32) and therefore their bound state
cannot transform itself under the spinor representation. by introducing, however,
a wilson line along the compactied direction around which the anti d string is
wrapped we can make it to transform as a scalar of so(32). therefore, if instead
of the one in eq.(7.59) we introduce the state

|a >= |d1 > +|d1 >

,

30

(7.65)

where the prime denotes the wilson line, it will have the correct quantum numbers
for representing in type i theory the stable state of the heterotic so(32). this is
the state proposed by sen [22] to represent in type i theory the stable non bps
perturbative massive state in eq.(7.52) in the so(32) heterotic string.

up to now we have not really used the fact that one direction has been com-
pactied. in the following instead we want to consider the d1/d1 system at the
particular radius :

r =s 

2

.

(7.66)

this value is special for two reasons. from the mass-shell condition l0  1/2 = 0
of the ns sector of the open type i theory we get the following mass spectrum:

m 2 = n  1/2 +

(n + 1/2)2

r2

,

(7.67)

where n is the oscillator number, n is a integer and the quantity (n + 1/2)/r is the
kaluza-klein momentum obtained from the general expression p = n/r + /(2r)
for  =  corresponding to z2 wilson lines. for the critical radius in eq.(7.66) the
lighest string excitations, corresponding to the values n = 0,1, are massless and
not tachyonic. but since in the limit of innite radius they give rise to tachyons,
we will call them tachyons also in the case we are considering.

the second reason is that the conformal eld theory generated by x 1 and 1,
where the direction 1 corresponds to the compactied one, admits several represen-
tations. one of them is the one obtained by just using x 1 and 1. the other two
can be obtained by fermionizing x 1 in terms of two additional fermions  and :

eix1/2 

1
2

(  i)

,

  ix 1/(2)

.

(7.68)

the three fermions 1,  and  are completely on equal footing and can be regrouped
in three dierent ways. the rst is the one in which we combine  and  as in
eq.(7.68) and we represent them in terms of the scalar eld x 1 together with the
fermionic eld 1. the other two correspond in combining either  and 1 or  and
1 in terms of respectively the scalar elds  and  as follows

,

1  i/(2)

,

(7.69)

(7.70)

 and  are bosonic elds compactied on a circle with radius given in eq.(7.66).
the advantage of using  and  instead of x 1 and 1 is that in this case it is
possible to explicitly encode the tachyonic background in the conformal eld theory

31

and to move the system from the unstable to a stable situation. in order to show
this let us start from the tachyonic states in the 1 picture:

|ti = e i2

x1

|0i1  1

(7.71)

and look at the explicit form of their vertex operators vt
in the various represen-
tations. using the bosonization formulas (7.68), (7.69) and (7.70) it is easy to see
that

(7.75)

is formally identical to a massless vector state at zero momentum in the 1 picture
with  replaced by . this implies that the deformation induced by |t i corre-
sponding to change the vacuum expectation value of the tachyonic state can be
described by the introduction of wilson lines, that, however, should not be confused

the integral in eq.(7.79), we get

where w is the total winding number of the closed string state as seen by the
operator w ().

let us now construct the boundary state of type iib theory corresponding to
the stable state following very closely the procedure described in ref. [25]. in the
language of the boundary state the proposal of ref. [22] corresponding to eq.(7.65),
is given by the superposition of the boundary states describing respectively the d
string and the anti d string. to describe this system we introduce the following
boundary states

|b, +ins  |d1, +ins + |d1, +ins
|b, +ir  |d1, +ir  |d1, +ir

(7.82)
(7.83)

where the  indicates the presence of the z2 wilson line. note that the minus sign
in eq. (7.83) accounts for the fact that one of the two members of the pair is an
anti d-string. using the explicit expressions for the boundary state, we have [25]

where we have denoted by s(1) the d-string s-matrix for all non-compact directions
and have separately indicated in the second line the contribution of the bosonic and

fermionic non-zero modes of the compact direction (i.e. the modes of x,  and e).
due to the presence of the z2 wilson line, the vacuum |ins is given by

|ins = (8)(qi)|k0 = 0i xw |0, wi +xw

let us now suppose that the radius r is equal to the critical radius given in eq.(7.66)
and rewrite the boundary state using a parametrization along the compact direction
in terms of the coordinate  instead of x 1 as we have done in eqs.(7.84) and (7.86).
this will also allow the introduction of u(1) wilson lines corresponding to a non
vanishing vacuum expectation value for the tachyon. we are now in the position of
writing the boundary state which describes the d-string  anti d-string pair in the
presence of a non vanishing tachyon v.e.v. this is given by eqs. (7.84) and (7.86)
with the oscillators n, n, r, r of the compact direction replaced by n, n, r
and r, and with a vacuum that carries an explicit dependence on the parameter 
according to eq.(7.81). in particular, in the ns-ns sector we have

notice that at  = 0 the boundary states (7.89) and (7.91) reduce to the original
ones written in eqs.(7.84) and (7.86). however the idea is that, for arbitrary values
of , only the boundary states (7.89) and (7.91) must be used.

in the computation of the interaction between two boundary states of the type
as in eqs.(7.89) and (7.91) we must perform the gso projection that acts on the
boundary state in terms of the variables  and  dierently than on the original
variables x 1 and 1. from eq.(7.69) one can immediately read the action of (1) f
getting in the ns-ns sector

(1)ef

(7.93)
and similarly for (1)f on the left moving oscillators. notice that the action of
(1) f on  looks very much like t-duality because it amounts to change the relative
sign between its left and right moving oscillators. it acts also on the zero modes as
follows:

let us now compute the vacuum amplitude of the theory dened on the world-
volume of our d-string  anti d-string pair. in the boundary state formalism this
amplitude is simply given by

a() = hb(), +| pgso d |b(), +i

(7.98)

where the gso projection operator is given in eqs.(1.9) and d is the closed string
propagator

with intercept ans = 1/2 in the ns-ns sector, and ar = 0 in the r-r sector.

where v is the (innite) length of the time direction

it is interesting to observe that the contribution of the ns-ns(1)f spin struc-
ture (i.e. the second term in eq. (7.100)) does not depend on the tachyon v.e.v.
. this is a direct consequence of the fact that this spin structure arises from
the overlap between |b(), +ins, whose vacuum contains states with only winding
numbers, and (1)ef|b(), +ins, whose vacuum instead contains states with only
kaluza-klein numbers (see eqs.(7.90) and (7.97)). therefore, in the ns-ns(1)f
spin structure there is no contribution from the bosonic zero modes of the compact
direction , and hence no dependence on the tachyon v.e.v. .

if one performs the modular transformation t  1/t, the entire amplitude a()
can be interpreted as the one-loop vacuum energy of the open strings living in the
world-volume of the d-string  anti d-string pair.

in particular, one sees that the -independent ns-ns(1)f spin structure of the
closed string channel goes into the r spin structure of the open string channel, that
indeed has been shown in ref. [22] to be independent of the tachyon v.e.v.

at  = 1 a remarkable simplication occurs: the r-r contribution to a vanishes

and the entire vacuum amplitude becomes

notice that with these manipulations we have managed to reconstruct the typical
combination of f -functions that is produced by the usual gso projection of the
ns-ns sector. thus, one is lead to think that a simpler underlying structure may
actually exist at  = 1. in fact the amplitude a( = 1) can be factorized in terms
of a new boundary state according to [25]

of course, the simple factorization of a vacuum amplitude does not allow to con-
clude that the two boundary states that have been used are completely equivalent.
however, a detailed analysis of correlation functions shows that the new boundary

state |eb, +i, which is written in terms of the original degrees of freedom for the

compact direction (i.e. x and ), is equivalent to the boundary state of eq. (7.89)
for  = 1. for details see ref. [25].

based on these results, we can conclude that in order to describe the d-string
 anti d-string pair at r = rc in terms of x and , we have to use the original
boundary states of eqs.(7.84) and (7.86) if  = 0, whereas we have to use the new
boundary state of eq. (7.105) if  = 1. of course, at this particular value of 
there is no r-r sector, as we have explicitly shown.
it is interesting to observe

that |b, +ins and |eb, +i can be related to each other by means of a generalized
t-duality. indeed, as is clear from eqs.(7.84) and (7.105), we may go from |b, +ins
to |eb, +i by changing the sign to the right moving oscillators of the compact di-
rection, and consequently by changing the vacuum from |0, 2wi to |w, 0i since the
radius of x satises eq.(7.66) (see also eq.(7.96)). like the true t-duality, also this
generalized t-duality transforms a longitudinal direction into a transverse one,

so that the new boundary state |eb, +i describes a d0-brane with a compact trans-

verse direction. however, unlike the true t-duality, the generalized t-duality
switches o the r-r sector. this fact suggests that, more than a symmetry of the
theory, this generalized t-duality has to be regarded simply as an eective way
of implementing the change of the tachyon v.e.v.
from  = 0 to  = 1 on the
original boundary states, which can be justied by introducing the new elds  and
 through the bosonization procedure as it has been done above [25].

up to now we have worked at the critical radius given in eq.(7.66). as pointed
out in ref. [25] the decompactication limit is ill dened on the original boundary

37

states (|b, +in s and |b, +ir) because their vacuum contains only odd or even
winding numbers, but it is perfectly well dened on the new one (| b, +in s) at
 = 1. in fact when r   we get

|ei = 2 (8)(qi)|k0 = 0i 2rz dk1
9y=0|k = 0i

= 4r (9)(qi)

2 |k1i

9yi=2|ki = 0i

(7.107)

which corresponds to the vacuum structure of a 0 brane. furthermore, combining

the factor of 4r from eq. (7.107) with the prefactors of |eb, +i in eq.(7.105), we

see that the complete normalization of the boundary state becomes
2 t0

(7.108)

r

where we have used the asymptotic behavior of  for r   (see eq.(6.29) and the
explicit expression of the tensions tp (see eq. (1.1)). thus, in the decompactication
limit our system is described by

|eb, +i =

9y=0 |k = 0i .

r  s(0)  r(cid:21)

(7.109)

by performing the usual gso projection, we then obtain the complete boundary
state

which describes a d0-brane in the type iib theory. since there is no r-r sector,
this d-particle is non-supersymmetric and non-bps. moreover, from eq.(7.109) we
explicitly see that its tension (or mass) is a factor of 2 bigger than the tension of
the ordinary supersymmetric d-particle of the type iia theory.

it turns out that the non-supersymmetric d particle is still an unstable con-
guration of type iib theory. this is due to the fact that the absence of a r-r
sector implies the absence of gso projection in the open string channel. therefore
one gets an open string tachyon that denotes instability. however, this tachyon is
eliminated by the  projection by going from type iib to type i theory. in conclu-
sion the 0 brane that we have constructed above is a stable conguration of type i
theory.
