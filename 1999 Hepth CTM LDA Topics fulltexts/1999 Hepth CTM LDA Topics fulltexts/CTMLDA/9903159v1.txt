abstract

we nd topological defect solutions to the equations of motion of a generalised
higgs model with antisymmetric tensor elds.

1. introduction

it is well known that the higgs-mechanism [1] involving a complex scalar and a vec-
tor particle can be extended to antisymmetric tensor elds [2]. the formal extension
consists in a model containing a (h-1)-form, an h-form and a scalar eld with a higgs
type lagrangian in a spacetime of arbitrary dimension d = d + 1. when the scalar
eld gets a vacuum expectation value, the h-form eats the degrees of freedom of the
(h-1)-form and acquires a mass.
in this paper we will look for solutions to the equations of motion of the generalised
higgs model. we will work in close analogy to the paper of nielsen and olesen [3]
on the vortex-solution in four dimensions (also of use in superconductivity). in the
same approximation as in [3], we will nd topological defect solutions that extend
over d  h  1 dimensions.
these solutions have their importance in the study of the dierent phases in antisym-
metric tensor eld theories and they play a role in determining the physical content
[4] of a brane-antibrane system after tachion condensation [5].

2. the antisymmetric tensor higgs model

we study a model in d = d + 1 dimensions with the following eld content: an
antisymmetric tensor of degree h, h, an antisymmetric tensor of degree h  1, ch1
and a scalar eld f . we consider the following action 2:

s = z dd+1x (dh  dh + df  df

m(f )2(dch1 + q h)  (dch1 + q h)  u(f )),

(2.1)

where m(f ) and u(f ) are general functions of the scalar eld. the gauge symmetries
of this action are:

h = dh1

ch1 = q h1 + dh2.

(2.2)

if the scalar eld f acquires a vacuum expectation value, it is appropriate to use the
gauge freedom to gauge away the (h-1)-form ch1 completely. a massive h-form h

2when using form-notation we will be sloppy with numerical factors, but in component form we

believe to have every factor straight.

and a real scalar will be left as physical elds, as in the ordinary higgs-mechanism.
later on we will make use of a specic form of the potential:

u(f ) = c2f 2 + c4f 4,

(2.3)

where we took over some of the conventions of [3] for easy comparison. note that for
d = 4 and h = 1 and the quartic potential, the model matches up with the higgs-
model, where 1 is the gauge eld, c0 represents the phase of the complex scalar, and
f its modulus. the function m(f ) is then given by m(f )2 = f 2.
the lagrangian is expressed in component form as follows:

l
q|g|

= 

1

2(h + 1)!

((h + 1)[mh+1m1...mh])2

1
2

(m f )2  m(f )2 1

2h!



(h [mhcm1...mh1] + q m1...mh)2  u(f ) (2.4)

the equations of motion corresponding to this lagrangian are:

0 =

0 =

1

mh+1q|g|(d)mh+1m1...mh

q|g|
m(f )2q(h [mhc m1...mh1] + q m1...mh)
1
q|g|


m (q|g|m f )
m(f )m(f )(h [mhcm1...mh1] + q m1...mh)2  u(f )

1
h!

0 = m1(q|g|m(f )2(h [mhc m1...mh1] + q m1...mh)),

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

where a prime denotes dierentiation with respect to f . the last equation is the
equation of motion corresponding to the ch1 form. it merely states that the h-form
h couples to a conserved current

jm1...mh = qq|g|m(f )2(h [mhc m1...mh1] + q m1...mh).

(2.8)

3. ansatz and solution

in close analogy to [3], we will look for a topological defect solution of dimension
d  h  1. the (h+1)-form eld strength will measure the number of topological
defects passing through a h + 1 dimensional plane perpendicular to the defects. we
can dene a magnetic ux  owing through a (h+1)-dimensional ball and calculate
it in terms of the (h-1)-form eld strength

  zbh+1
= zs h
= 

1

h

q zs h

dch1,

(3.1)

dh

2

where we have used the fact that there is no current over the h-sphere that is the
boundary of the (h+1)-ball. 3

we consider an ansatz with so(h+1)poincare (dh1, 1) symmetry. we use the
following coordinates adapted to the symmetry: (r, , 1, . . . , h1, t, z1, . . . , zdh1)
the ansatz reads in these coordinates:

h = |(r)|rhdh

ch1 = kh1(lh1 + fh1(h1)) dh1

(3.2)
(3.3)

where dh denotes the volumeform of the h-sphere with volume sh. moreover we take
the constants kh1 and lh1 to be

kh1 =

2
sh

= 

(h1)

2 (

h + 1

2

)

lh1 =


2

( h
2 )
( h+1
2 )

,

and the function fh1 satises
d

dh1

f (h1) = sinh1 h1,

following [6]. from these formulae we easily derive:
dh = r(||rh) dr  dh

dch1 = kh1 sinh1 h1dh1  dh1

= kh1 dh

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

the (h-1)-form ansatz is chosen such that from the formula for the ux (3.1), we can
conclude that there will be a topological defect in the (t, z1, . . . zdh1) direction. fill-
ing in the ansatz in the equations of motion results in the following set of dierential
equations:

0 =

r(rhrf )

1
rh
m(f )m(f )(

kh1
rh + q||)2  u(f )

0 = r(

1
rh

r(||rh))  m(f )2q (q|| +

kh1
rh )

(3.9)

(3.10)

following [3], we consider the situation in which f tends to a constant value at innity
(transverse to the topological defect). in that approximation, we can solve (3.10) for
|| in terms of modied bessel functions 4:
1
c
rh +
q

(qmr)+1k(qmr)

(3.11)

|| = 

kh1
q

3 for the case h = 1 it is clear that the magnetic ux is quantized [3]. for h = 2 see [4]. to us it
seems that in the case h  2 you could suppose the existence of an electric charge for the (h-1)-form
to have quantization of the magnetic ux for the h-form, reasoning along the lines of [6].

4details of the standard manipulations are in the rst appendix.

where the index of the modied bessel function is given by  = h+1

integration constant. the magnetic eld strength becomes:

and c is an

|h| 

1
rh

r(rh||)

= cm(qmr)+1k1(qmr)

(3.12)

where we have used a property of the modied bessel function given in the second
appendix (b.3). the asymptotic behavior of the magnetic eld is then (b.2):

|h|r = cs m

2qr

(qmr)+1eqmr + . . .

(3.13)

we can dene a characteristic length measuring the distance over which the magnetic
eld diers appreciably from zero:

 

1
qm

(3.14)

this is the analog of the penetration depth in superconductivity.

we turn now to the other equation of motion (3.9), the one corresponding to the
scalar eld f . we will restrict from this point on to the special case of a quartic higgs
potential (2.3). if we assume that the deviation of the h-form from  kh1
qrh is negligable
compared to the eect of a steep potential, in other words, if the coecients c2 and
c4 are large, than (3.9) is approximately satised if f takes the constant value that
minimizes the potential:

< f >  v

= s c2

2c4

(3.15)

to get an idea of the position dependence of f we consider uctuations around its
vacuum expectation value [3]:

at innity we nd an approximate solution

f = v + (r)

(r)  e4c2r

giving rise to a new characteristic length,

 =

,

(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18)

the generalisation of the correlation length in superconductivity. it is nothing but the
inverse of the mass of the higgs-particle, and it measures the distance over which f
diers appreciably form its vacuum expectation value. all of this to spell out that the
behavior of the elds is analogous to the well known special case of the nielsen-olesen
vortex-solution, due to the general properties of the modied bessel functions. we
further remark that to have a clear corelike topological defect of dimension dh1, we

4

need  and  both small. for r <<  we require that the magnetic ux  = v (sh)||
vanish, xing the integration constant to:

c = (2)+1(qm)h,

(3.19)

where we made use of formula (b.1) in the appendix, (3.4) and (3.11). this nishes
the discussion of the approximate solution.

4. a remark

for some applications it is useful to have an estimate of the energy density of the
d  h  1-dimensional topological defect. in [3] the idea was to match up the energy
density of the vortex with the string tension of the dual string model. the reasoning
was that the string model would be a good eective description of the eld theory in
a regime where the vortex solution becomes the most important classical solution to
the action [3]. than you can link the eld theory parameters to the string tension,
1
2 . following [4] we can study the special case of the membrane-like solution in
d = 5 + 1 and with h = 2 and try to match its energy density to the m2-brane
tension. we only make a rough analysis, indicating that this is less straightforward.
treating the mass m as a constant, the magnetic contribution to the energy density

is in the general case [3] :

em 


sh

2 z 

0
sh

2(2)22

|h|2rhdr
qh1mh+1z 

0

k1(z)2z dz

(4.1)

from the asymptotic behavior of the modied bessel functions (b.2), it is clear that
the integrand converges fast enough at innity, but near z = 0 (b.1), the integrand
behaves as zh+2. for a nite result we thus need h < 3. than the integral is of order
unity and the magnetic energy density of order

em  qh1mh+1

(4.2)

the contribution to the energy density of the topological defect due to the scalar

eld f can roughly be approximated by [3]:

ef  h+1c2v2

3h

c

2

2
c4



(4.3)

we note that for h = 1 and m = v = q c2

the two estimates match [3]. for other
values of h like h = 2 the naive analysis gives an ambiguous result. we will not pursue
this here. notice though, that our sketchy analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the
magnetic eld and the energy density is ner than the one in [4].

2c4

5. conclusions

we studied higgsed antisymmetric tensor eld theories. specically we searched
for and found topological defect solutions, generalizing the work by nielsen and olesen

5

on vortex solutions in four dimensions [3]. we wrote down the approximate behavior
of the elds at innity in terms of modied bessel functions, making use of the
assumption that the scalar eld there reaches a constant vacuum expectation value.
we briey indicated the possibility of identifying the energy density of the topological
defect solutions in terms of eld theory parameters, with possible other descriptions
of the same objects. we hope that these explicit solutions may be of benet to a study
of the phases of antisymmetric tensor theories and to the study of brane anti-brane
systems in string theory.

a. solution of the dierential equation

we solve the dierential equation (3.10):

0 = r(

for constant f by standard techniques. first, we dene a new unknown function, ,
and a new variable z :

in terms of the new variables the dierential equation takes the form:

to bring this to a well known form, we dene still another function x = z
