abstract

we analyse the highest weight representations of the n = 1 ramond algebra and show
that their structure is richer than previously suggested in the literature.
in particular,
we show that certain verma modules over the n = 1 ramond algebra contain degenerate
(2-dimensional) singular vector spaces and that in the supersymmetric case they can even
contain subsingular vectors. after choosing a suitable ordering for the n = 1 ramond
algebra generators we compute the ordering kernel, which turns out to be two-dimensional
for complete verma modules and one-dimensional for g-closed verma modules. these
two-dimensional ordering kernels allow us to derive multiplication rules for singular vector
operators and lead to expressions for degenerate singular vectors. using these multiplication
rules we study descendant singular vectors and derive the ramond embedding diagrams for
the rational models. we give all explicit examples for singular vectors, degenerate singular
vectors, and subsingular vectors until level 3. we conjecture the ordering kernel coecients
of all (primitive) singular vectors and therefore identify these vectors uniquely.

highest weight representations of the n = 1 ramond algebra

introduction

the extension of string theory to supersymmetric string theories identied the n = 1 ramond
algebra and the n = 1 neveu-schwarz algebra as the symmetry algebras of closed superstrings
as rst introduced by ademollo et al.1. therefore, the ramonda algebra and the neveu-
schwarz algebra are the most important symmetry algebras with respect to superstring theory.
even though this signicance of the ramond algebra is known since more than a decade, the
representations of the ramond algebra are still very poorly understood and results given in the
literature on its representation theory are largely incomplete as we shall show in this paper.

due to the conformal invariance on the string world-sheet only superconformal extensions
of the virasoro algebra are suitable symmetry algebras of superstrings.
in the case of one
fermionic current one obtains only two possible super extensions of the virasoro algebra16: the
n = 1 ramond algebra and the n = 1 neveu-schwarz algebra. whilst the latter corresponds
to antiperiodic boundary conditions of the elds living on the world-sheet of the closed super-
strings, the ramond algebra corresponds to periodic boundary conditions. the space of states
of a superstring theory will therefore decompose in irreducible highest weight representations
of the ramond algebra and neveu-schwarz algebra. certain aspects of the highest weight
representations of both algebras have been studied by many authors in the past. but so far
only in the neveu-schwarz case one has achieved all the desirable results about the structure
of its representations2. the kac-determinant formulae play a crucial role for the analysis of
these representations. in the ramond case it has rst been conjectured by friedan, qiu, and
shenker13 whilst in the neveu-schwarz case the formula has rst been given by kac17. both
formulae have been proven by meurman and rocha-caridi20.

one can construct all irreducible representations from verma modules by considering quo-
tients of the verma modules divided by their largest proper submodules. submodules of verma
modules are spanned by null-vectors which themselves are generated by singular and subsin-
gular vectors. in this context, singular vectors are the vectors with lowest conformal weight of
such submodules. once the kac-determinant formulae are known, one can obtain information
on null-vectors and singular vectors by analysing the determinants roots. the largest proper
submodule and thus all null-vectors are given by the kernel of the inner product matrix. hence,
null-vectors are orthogonal on the whole space of states and therefore decouple from the string
theory. in this sense they lead us to dierential equations for the n-point functions and therefore
describe the dynamics of the string theory. in the virasoro case12 and in the neveu-schwarz
case2 subsingular vectors do not exist and therefore their highest weight representations can
solely be analysed using singular vectors. embedding diagrams of singular vectors have been
conjectured for the ramond algebra only for the unitary cases by assuming the non-existence of
subsingular vectors19. however, for the ramond algebra this property has never been proven.
furthermore, it was assumed that singular vectors with the same weight would always be lin-
early dependent, a fact that is true for the virasoro case and has been proven to be true for
the neveu-schwarz case2. we will show that both assumptions fail for the ramond algebra.
the n = 1 ramond algebra contains both degenerate singular vectors (linearly independent
singular vectors with the same weights) as well as subsingular vectors. the latter occur only in
the supersymmetric caseb  = c
24 whilst the former appear even for some of the minimal mod-
els, however not for the unitary cases. we therefore show that the general ramond embedding
diagrams do not follow the simple rules as for the virasoro case and consequently the connexion

afor simplicity we shall call the n = 1 ramond algebra simply the ramond algebra and similarly for

the n = 1 neveu-schwarz algebra.

bthe cases with ground states of conformal weight  = c

24 are called supersymmetric since the global

supersymmetry is unbroken13.

between the verma modules and the irreducible characters contains more complications.

motivated by similar ndings for the n = 2 superconformal algebras in ref. 9 a method
has been developed to derive upper limits for the degree of degeneracy of singular vectors.
using this method one easily nds for the case of the virasoro algebra and also for the n = 1
neveu-schwarz algebra that both algebras do not allow any degeneracy at all18, 9. however for
the n = 2 algebras degenerate singular vector spaces have been found for all 4 types of n = 2
superconformal algebras9, 10. the main result of this so-called adapted ordering procedure is
the ordering kernel. the number of elements of the ordering kernel sets an upper limit on the
linearly independent singular vectors with the same weight. surprisingly enough, we will nd
that the n = 1 ramond algebra also has an ordering kernel of size 2 and therefore also allows
degenerate levels for which we will give explicit examples. degenerate levels complicate very
much the analysis of the embedding structure of submodules - so-called embedding diagrams -
since the simple comparison of levels is not enough to decide whether or not two singular vectors
are proportional. this information, however, is crucial for the corresponding character formulae.
the ordering kernel helps even in this matter as has been shown in ref. 9 that the elements
of the ordering kernel are sucient to uniquely identify a singular vector. by comparing their
coecients with respect to the ordering kernel it is hence easy to identify linearly independent
singular vectors. furthermore, we can obtain product expressions for singular vector operators
that easily reveal the vanishing of a descendant singular vector. in ref. 11 it will be shown that
the vanishing product of two singular vector operators may lead to subsingular vectors which
therefore can also be found using the ordering kernel.

the n = 1 ramond algebra is a subalgebra of the n = 2 twisted superconformal algebra.
its highest weight representations inherit features that are very similar to those of the latter one.
the n = 2 twisted superconformal highest weight representations have been studied in ref.
10. considering these strong similarities of their representation theories it is rather puzzling
that the n = 1 ramond algebra is so extremely important for string theory whilst the n = 2
twisted superconformal algebra has so far obtained very little attention in string theory. despite
these similarities, the representation theories also have a few important dierences which will
become clear in section 5.

the multiplication rules derived in the present paper give the necessary basis for the anal-
ysis of descendant singular vectors and consequently the derivation of the ramond embedding
diagrams. we discuss the most interesting embedding diagrams including the minimal models
and indicate the limitations of the embedding diagrams of the unitary cases by kiritsis19. we
point out the main dierences of ramond embeddings to virasoro embeddings. a full set of
ramond embedding diagrams will be given in ref. 4.

some necessary introductory remarks about the ramond algebra will be given in section
2. in section 3, we rst review the main ideas and implications of the adapted ordering method
introduced in ref. 9. we then dene an adapted ordering for the ramond algebra and compute
its ordering kernel. in section 4, we thus deduce the singular dimensions and derive multiplica-
tion rules for vectors identied by their ordering kernel coecients. in section 5, we compute
necessary conditions on the ordering kernel coecients of (primitive) singular vectors, which
allows us to conjecture these coecients for all (primitive) singular vectors. we hence compute
all cases of degenerate singular vectors. using the multiplication rules of section 4 we give in
section 6 a rst analysis of the most interesting embedding diagrams, the rational models. a
complete discussion of the ramond embedding diagrams is beyond the scope of this work and
shall be given in a future publication4. g-closed verma modules and g-closed singular vectors
are considered in section 7 and 8 respectively. g-closed verma modules also lead to the simplest
type of subsingular vectors. in section 7 we will also show that there are no further subsingular
vectors that are related to the vanishing of singular vector operator products. examples of all

highest weight representations of the n = 1 ramond algebra

singular vectors, degenerate singular vector spaces, and subsingular vectors for levels  3 will
be given in the appendix. we conclude the paper with some nal remarks in section 9.

2 the n = 1 ramond algebra

periodic boundary conditions for the elds on the world-sheet of a closed string require the
fermionic current to have modes with integer scaling dimensions. therefore, the symmetry
algebra is the super-extension of the virasoro algebra by integer moded odd generators gm.

denition 2.a the n = 1 ramond algebra consists of the virasoro algebra generatorsc lm,
m  z, and the fermionic current generators gn, n  z with the commutation relationsd

[lm, ln] = (m  n)lm+n +

)m+n,0 ,

[lm, c] = [gn, c] = 0 ,

(1)

for m, n  z.

let us note that the ramond algebra is a subalgebra of the twisted n = 2 superconformal
algebra. comparing with the results obtained in ref. 10 we shall see that this fact leads to
strong similarities between the ramond highest weight representations and the highest weight
representations of the twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra. the squares of the fermionic
operators can be expressed in terms of virasoro operators, as one can easily obtain from the
commutation relations eqs. (1):

g2

m = l2m  m,0

c
24

, m  z .

(2)

for applications in physics one usually extends the ramond algebra by the (fermion) parity

operatore (1)f . it commutes with the operators lm and c but anticommutes with gn

[(1)f , lm] = [(1)f , c] = 0 , m  z ,

{(1)f , gn} = 0 , n  z .

(3)

the operator (1)f therefore distinguishes fermionic states from bosonic states in the space of
states and is present in most applications in physics. we will therefore in the following always
consider the extended ramond algebra. later in this section we will show that this does not
at all restrict our results to the extended algebra but they can easily be transferred to the
unextended algebra. we hence give the following denition.

denition 2.b the ramond algebra eqs. (1) extended by the fermion parity operator (1)f
of eq. (3) shall simply be called the ramond algebra r1. we will explicitly say the unextended
ramond algebra, denoted by r

1 whenever we want to refer to the algebra of eqs. (1) only.

cwe use the notation n = {1, 2, 3, . . .}, n0 = {0, 1, 2, . . .}, and z = {. . . , 1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}.
dthe n = 1 ramond algebra satises the same commutation relations as the n = 1 neveu-schwarz.
the only dierence is that for the latter algebra the fermionic current has modes with half-integer indices.

enote that due to eq. (2) the fermion number f is not well dened, however, the parity (1)f is.

the central term c commutes with all other operators and can therefore be xed as c  c.
hr1 = span{l0, (1)f , c} denes a cartan subalgebra of r1 which elements can hence be
diagonalised simultaneously. generators with positive index span the set of positive operators
r+
1 of r1 and likewise generators with negative index span the set of negative operators r

r1:

the zero modes are spanned by r0
the operator g0.

1 = span{l0, g0, (1)f , c} which contain besides hr1 also

for eigenvectors of hr1 we denote the l0-eigenvalue by  (the conformal weight), the c-
eigenvalue by c, and the (1)f eigenvalue simply by  (the parity) for 1. the c-eigenvalue
c (the conformal anomaly) shall for simplicity be suppressed in the notation. highest weight
vectors, verma modules and singular vectors are dened in the usual wayf .

denition 2.c an eigenvector |i of hr1 with vanishing r+
1 action is called a highest weight
vector. by convention we dene a highest weight vector |i to have positive parity. additional
zero-mode vanishing conditionsg are possible with respect to the operator g0. we write |ig if
g0 |ig = 0 and call it a g-closed highest weight vector. for |ig we necessarily have  = c
24 .

for an eigenvector p

l of hr1 in v the conformal weight is  + l and the parity is p with
l  n0 and p  {} which we denote as level |p
l |f = p. we can hence
dene the notion of singular vectors which - as we shall explain later - correspond to vectors of
lowest conformal weight in a given subrepresentation of a verma module and conversely every
proper subrepresentation of a verma module needs to contain at least one singular vector.

denoted as g

similarly for g
|i can be written as 12 |i with two singular
vector operators 1 and 2, 1 not proportional to g0, then 
is called a secondary singular

vector or a descendant singular vector of 2 |i. otherwise it is called a primitive singular
vector.

highest weight representations of the n = 1 ramond algebra

in the denition of secondary singular vectors we had to exclude operators 1 that are
multiples of g0 simply because, for most singular vectors, g0 interpolates between two singular
vectors at the same level but of dierent parity. the only exceptions appear for levels l with
 + l = c
0 vanishes and therefore g0 cannot interpolate between
two states. surely, if g0 interpolates between a pair of singular vectors then both vectors are
either secondary or primitive.

before we continue, we shall now compare verma modules over the (extended) ramond
algebra r1 with verma modules over the unextended ramond algebra. for the unextended
algebra r

with l0 and c. we hence dene highest weight vectors of the unextended algebra with respect
to their g0 eigenvalue.

 of the unextended ramond algebra3, 22, with  = q  c

except for the supersymmetric case3  = c
24 , a verma module v is always reducible to two
verma modules v 
24 . we should
note that for lie superalgebras schurs lemma does not hold any more in the sense that the
cartan subalgebra can always be diagonalised on irreducible representations16. instead we can
obtain grade spaces for which only the square of the negative parity operator g0 is diagonal but
not necessarily g0 itself. but except for the supersymmetric case  = c
24 we can always build
a r1 verma module on an eigenvector |i of g0. suppose that |i was not an eigenvector
24 , then the combinations g0 |i   |i are
of g0 but of l0 with eigenvalue  = 2 + c
two eigenvectors of g0 with eigenvalues  that generate together the module built on |i
1 verma modules built on highest weight vectors |i as we shall
and form themselves two r
see. therefore, the above denition 2.f of (unextended) highest weight vectors is justied.
the fact that odd generators of the cartan subalgebra may not be diagonal in an irreducible
representation is another reason why for applications in physics we may want to choose a lie
algebra as cartan subalgebra rather than a lie superalgebra. therefore the extended algebra
r1 is a more natural choice. nevertheless, let us show here that we can easily relate extended
and unextended verma modules and in most cases the unextended verma modules embedded
in an extended verma module diagonalise g0.

if  6= c

24 it is easy to see that the two vectors |i = g0 |i  q  c

24 |i are
eigenvectors of g0 with eigenvalues  = q  c
24 . these are the highest weight vectors of
the two unextended verma modules v 
 is direct as
we shall show in the following theorem. this is essentially because the operator (1)f - which
is not contained in the unextended algebra - interpolates between the two vectors.

theorem 2.g the verma module v contains for  6= c
vectors |i with  = 2 + c

24 the two (unextended) highest weight

24 (i.e.  6= 0). the sum
  v 


v = v 

(12)

is direct and we have (1)f interpolating between the two highest weight vectors: (1)f |i =
|i.

proof: the vectors |i are given by g0 |i q  c
  v 

, we hence nd operators +, , +,   u (r

 and   v 

1 ) such that

24 |i as previously discussed. assume

 = (+ + +g0) |i = ( + g0) |i .

(13)

we can write this in the standard basis for v and easily obtain (+   + + + )g0 |i+
(+ +  + +  ) |i = 0. taking into account that in the non-supersymmetric case |i
and g0 |i do not satisfy any vanishing conditions in v we therefore nd that the operators
acting on these two basis vectors must vanish identically. however, this results in ++ = 0
and hence  = (++) |i = 0. therefore the sum is direct. furthermore, the highest weight
vector |i = |i|i
. by
construction the vectors |i are contained in v and thus also v 
  v. finally, one
easily checks that (1)f |i has g0 eigenvalue .

 and therefore v  v 

is contained in the sum v 

  v

let us now try to diagonalise g0 on the l0-grade spaces of v 

 . we dene

l = r + l 

c
24

.

(14)

we assume that l 6= 0 and take any operator l  u (r
vectors

1  {g0}). it is easy to see that the

l

l, = (g0l  ll) |i ,

(15)

are - if non-trivial - eigenvectors of g0 with eigenvalues l. again, we have (1)f interpolating
between the vectors +l

l, and l

l, for  6= 0.

an l0-grade space in v 

24 or  + l = c

 with l such that l 6= 0 has therefore also a diagonal g0 action.
with respect to the verma module v this change of basis involves the 4 vectors l |i, g0l |i,
lg0 |i, and g0lg0 |i transforming them into the 4 g0-eigenvectors l
l,. surely, in the
cases  = c
24 two of these vectors would obviously be trivial and the basis
transformation breaks down. the case where some of these 4 vectors are proportional plays a
very important role for our later considerations. if we assume that lg0 |i = g0l |i then
we easily obtain g0lg0 |i = 2
l l |i. if the rst relation is true on |i, then it is also true
on g0 |i and thus 2l |i = g0lg0 |i. comparing the two last conditions nally results
in 2
l 2 = 2. hence, only two proportionality factors are allowed by grouping the vectors in
two proportional pairs. in this case, however, the set of 4 vectors l |i, g0l |i, lg0 |i,
and g0lg0 |i denes only a 2-dimensional vector space whose basis transforms to

l

l, = (l  )(g0l  ll) |i ,

l

l, = (l  )(g0l  ll) |i .

(16)

(17)

hence, in either case of the two possible proportionality factors  one of the vectors l
be trivial and also one of the vectors l

l, would
l, would vanish. therefore, the two-dimensional

8

highest weight representations of the n = 1 ramond algebra

 and a one dimensional g0-eigenspace in v 

space dened by l |i, g0l |i, lg0 |i, and g0lg0 |i would be transformed in a one-
dimensional g0-eigenspace in v 
, one of them
having g0-eigenvalue l and l for the other one.
in the case that l = 0 we nd that
half of the operators l cannot be diagonalised with respect to g0. the corresponding vectors
g0l |i are hence eigenvectors of g0 with eigenvalue 0. the vectors generated by the other
half of operators cannot be transformed into a basis of g0-eigenvectors and only the square of
g0 is diagonal on them.

the eigenvalues are l which both appear except for the case of proportionality among pairs
of the vectors g0l |i and lg0 |i for some l  u (r
1  {g0}). in this case the eigenvalues
l will be shared among the verma modules v. if l = 0 then g0 cannot be diagonalised on

conversely, if we are now given a verma module of the unextended ramond algebra with
(only one) highest weight vector |i with g0 eigenvalue  6= 0 and hence l0-eigenvalue
24 we can easily obtain v by considering |i together with its partner |i =
 = 2 + c
(1)f |i with g0-eigenvalue  and imposing |i = |i|i
. this automatically implies
g0 |i = |i+|i
in the case of  = 0 we simply have to add  with g0 = |0i in
from v 
order to obtainh v c
0 . the notion of singular vectors is the same in extended and
unextended verma modules and furthermore g0 applied to a singular vector produces another
singular vector if non-trivial. therefore, if a highest weight representation of the extended r1
algebra is irreducible (i.e.
it has no singular vectors), then the two subrepresentations of the
unextended algebra are obviously also both irreducible. conversely, if we have an irreducible
representation of the unextended algebra built on |i,  6= 0, then the verma module of r1
built on |i constructed from |i and |i is also irreducible. since it is rather simple to
transform highest weight representations of the extended ramond algebra to highest weight
representations of the unextended algebra and conversely, it is justied to restrict ourselves to
the extended ramond algebra r1 which turns out to be more suitable for our considerations
as the cartan subalgebra is just a lie algebra. furthermore, applications in physics usually
require to distinguish bosonic from fermionic states and therefore the extended algebra is more
important for physics.

where we dene h| g0 |i = 0 since (1)f is diagonal on the two states. we obtain a (pseudo-
)norm of the vector x |i, x  u (r1) as h| x +x |i. a singular vector and the whole
embedded verma module built on it have obviously vanishing (pseudo-)norms. furthermore,
every vector contained in the largest proper submodule of v has vanishing (pseudo-)norm11.
these vectors form the kernel of the inner product matrix formed via eq. (19) as it is shown in
ref. 11. they therefore decouple from the eld theory. they are usually called null-vectorsi.
the quotient module where all null-vectors are set to 0 is hence an irreducible highest weight
representation. conversely, all irreducible highest weight representations can be constructed in
this way. singular vectors and their descendants do not necessarily span the whole submodule
of null-vectors. the quotient module of the verma module divided by the submodule spanned
by all singular vectors may again contain new singular vectors, called subsingular vectors.

denition 2.j let h be the submodule generated by all singular vectors of a verma module
v. the quotient module

q =

v
h

(20)

may or may not be irreducible. in the case that q is reducible it contains new singular vectors
 that were not singular in v.  is called subsingular vector in v. continuing with this
process one may nd subsingular vectors in q and further quotient modules until one obtains
an irreducible representation.

for the virasoro algebra and for the n = 1 neveu-schwarz algebra there are no subsingular
vectors12, 2, however, they have been discovered for the n = 2 superconformal algebras by gato-
rivera et al. in refs. 15, 14, 10. at rst, it seems that n = 1 superconformal symmetry is not
large enough to allow subsingular vectors. however, that this assumption does not hold for one
particular case of the extended ramond algebra will be shown in section 7 of this paper. the
fact that the largest proper submodule is equivalent to the kernel of the inner product matrix
assigns an important role to the determinant of the inner product matrix, usually called the
kac-determinant. if we choose an hr1 graded basis, then the inner product matrix is block
diagonal and the kac-determinant factorises in determinants of these blocks. the lowest grade
for which the determinant vanishes indicates the existence of a singular vector. for the n = 1
ramond algebra the determinant formula has been rst conjectured by friedan, qiu, shenker13
and has later been proven by meurman and rocha-caridi20. for level zero the determinant
formulae are detm +
24 . for the central term c at level l  n and parity
 we use the parametrisation22, 13 in t  c, (t 6= 0),

0 = 1 and detm

iif the pseudo-norm is positive semi-denite, then all vectors with vanishing norm are null-vectors.
however, if the pseudo-norm is not positive semi-denite there are vectors with vanishing pseudo-norm
that are not null-vectors11 and therefore do not decouple from the eld theory.

and satises pr(0) = 1. let us note that pr(l) is always even3 for l  1. for most c the
parametrisation eq. (21) has two solutions t1 and t2.
in which case we obtain t1 = 1/t2.
we note that p,q(t) = q,p(1/t) and c(t) = c(1/t) and therefore the set of curves p,q(t) is
invariant under the choice of solution t1 and t2. hence the parametrisation is well-dened. in
fact, the verma modules vp,q (t) and vq,p(1/t) are identical. from the determinant we know
that following the curves p,q(t) we obtain singular vectors which turn out to be generically
primitive.

theorem 2.k along the curve p,q(t) we nd (at least) two singular vectors 
level pq
primitive.

p,q(t) both at
2 and with parity , where p, q  n and p  q is odd. both vectors are generically

proof: for a given p,q(t) which does not intersect with any other curve p,q(t) where pq
2  pq
2
the claim is trivial. intersections of such curves are only given by discrete points t =  qq
pp .
continuity arguments easily show that 
p,q exists also for these discrete points (if it happens to
vanish identically, then at least one derivative would be singular) and these are the only points
for which 
2

p,q could be secondary. hence 

p,q is generically primitive.

g0 interpolates between the two parity sectors, provided g0 does not act on any g-closed
vector. therefore, the two sectors have exactly the same determinant expressions. starting
with a given singular vector +
l we can construct two
negative parity singular vectors:

|i  v with singular operator +

l = +

l

l g0 |i ,



g,l = +
l = g0+

l

g

(25)

(26)

likewise, g0 constructs two positive parity singular vectors from the singular vector

|i  v:

l =

l g0 |i ,

+

g,l = 
l = g0

(27)

(28)

this seems as if the (primitive) vectors 
p,q always come at least in pairs of 4 unless the
corresponding vectors of eqs. (25)-(28) are proportional. it is the ramond partition function
that requires the latter.

the factor (  (t)) in the determinant sets an upper limit for the dimension of the kernel
of the inner product matrix. generically, the multiplicity of p,q(t) at level pq
2 is pr(0) = 1
for each parity sectors. as 
p,q has to be in the kernel, there will generically be exactly one
singular vector for each parity at level pq
2 along the curve p,q(t) and hence the claimed pro-
portionalities have to be true generically. due to continuity this extends all along the curves
p,q(t). note that the fact that there is just one singular vector along p,q(t) at level pq
2 for
each parity must be true generically but may not be true for the discrete intersection points of
the curves p,q(t).

3 ordering kernels for ramond verma modules

verma modules of the virasoro algebra contain at most one singular vector at a given level.
this is a consequence of the embedding diagrams proven by feigin and fuchs12. on the other
hand, if one knows in advance that there can be at most one singular vector for a given level,
then the analysis of descendant singular vectors comes down to a detailed analysis of the roots
of the determinant formula. whenever one nds that the level of two secondary singular vectors
agree then these singular vectors need to be the same and the generated submodules would be
identical. this also allows us to derive the character formulae of the irreducible highest weight
representations. however, for verma modules where such a uniqueness of singular vectors
at a given level is not true the procedure of deriving the embedding patterns is much more
complicated. consequently the derivation of the characters via embedding diagrams also needs
more information in this case. this has been demonstrated in ref. 7 for the minimal models
of the n = 2 neveu-schwarz algebra. to solve such problems there are hence two questions of
major interest. first, which are the maximal dimensions a space of singular vectors can have
for a given weight - the so-called singular dimensions - and secondly, if the singular dimension is
greater than 1, how can we decide if two singular vectors at the same weight are proportional?
both questions can be answered with a rather simple but powerful method, the adapted ordering
method, introduced in ref. 9. there, this method has rst been used for the 3 isomorphic n = 2
superconformal algebras (the topological n = 2 algebra, the n = 2 neveu-schwarz algebra,
and the n = 2 ramond algebra) and just recently also for the twisted n = 2 algebra in ref.
10. in the latter case the adapted ordering method shows strong similarities to what we will
nd for r1. a priori the connexion between the following denition and the answers to the
questions above does not seem very obvious. the power of this method, however, lies in two
theorems which were proven in ref. 9 and which we will review after introducing the notion of
adapted orderings in the case of the ramond algebra. for convenience, let us rst dene the
following notation.

denition 3.a for x  cp

l and   r1 we set
x() = nnon  trivial terms of  x |io.

as the set of all non-trivial terms of  x |i in its normal form, 
subset of cp||f
l+||l

.

(39)

x() is - if non-trivial - a

highest weight representations of the n = 1 ramond algebra

13

in this notation we can give the denition of an adapted ordering in a particularly suitable

form:

denition 3.b let o be a total ordering on cp
o is said to be adapted to the subset cpa
one   k exists for which

l  cp

l . k = r+

l , in v with k = r+

1 , if for any x  cpa

o in the verma module v.

, cpk

l

l = cp

l \ cpa

l

is the (ordering) kernel with respect to the ordering

l

in other words, for each x  cpa

l  v and we assume that x is the o-smallest non-trivial term in p

there exists an annihilation operator  such that  x |i
contains at least one non-trivial term that is not contained in  y |i for all y that are strictly
o-larger than x. the signicance of this denition lies in the fact that if we know that p
l  0
for p
l , then there will
be at least one non-trivial term in p
l  0. hence only elements of the
ordering kernel cpk
l . these rather
simple thoughts result in the following two theorems that were proven in a more general setting
in ref. 9.

can be o-smallest non-trivial terms of a singular vector p

l which contradicts p

l

theorem 3.c if the ordering kernel cpk
and with annihilation operators k = r+
independent singular vectors p

l

l in v at level l with parity p.

of an adapted ordering at level l, parity p, in v
1 has n elements, then there are at most n linearly

theorem 3.d let o denote an adapted ordering at level l, parity p, with ordering kernel cpk
for a given verma module v and annihilation operators k = r+
1 . if the normal form of two
vectors p,1
in v at the same level l and parity p, both satisfying the highest weight
x for all terms x  cpk
conditions, have c1

l
x = c2

and p,2

, then

l

l

l

(41)

surely, every total ordering on cp

l would be adapted at least to the empty set   cp

l . this,
however, is not at all useful as the adapted kernel would be the whole set cp
l . the aim is to
nd orderings that lead to very small ordering kernels. coming back to the two questions set
in the introduction of this section, theorem 3.c answers the rst one: the size of the adapted
kernel sets an upper limit for the dimension of a space of singular vectors for a given weight.
theorem 3.d answers the second question: in order to decide if two singular vectors with the
same weight are proportional we do not need to compare all their coecients, in fact we do
not even need to know all their coecients, it is already enough to compare the few coecients
with respect to the ordering kernel. these coecients completely identify a singular vector.
this fact has been used for the n = 2 algebra in refs. 9, 10 and in a simpler version already
in ref. 6 for the n = 2 neveu-schwarz case. as the trivial vector has vanishing coecients
for all terms it follows that a singular vector needs to have at least one non-trivial term of the
ordering kernel. in the following we will compute ordering kernels for the ramond algebra r1
which will prove to be the smallest possible by explicit examples given in the appendix.

we obtain the corresponding denition of adapted orderings for g-closed verma modules

highest weight representations of the n = 1 ramond algebra

3.c and theorem 3.d hold accordingly. the same is true for g-closed singular vectors for which
we simply have to extend the set of annihilation operators to k = r+

1  {g0}.

the adapted ordering we are now going to introduce coincides formally with the adapted
ordering given in ref. 9 for the topological n = 2 superconformal algebra, restricted to the
fewer fermionic and bosonic generators in the n = 1 ramond case. even though our later
results will be similar to the twisted n = 2 case, the ordering for the twisted n = 2 case10 is
very dierent in the sense that the special role of the translation operator l1 has been taken
over by another n = 2 bosonic operator. we rst introduce an ordering on the setsk ln and
gn.

denition 3.e we take yi  lni for i = 1, 2 which we call case  = l or yi  gni for i = 1, 2
which we denote by case  = g. hence yi is of the form

yi = z i

in case g. we compute the indexl j0 = min{j : m1
j 6= 0, j = 1, . . . , min(ky1k, ky2k)}.
if non-trivial, j0 is the index for which the levels of the generators in y1 and y2 rst disagree
when read from the right to the left. for j0 > 0 we then dene

mi

with the help of denition 3.e we now introduce a suitable adapted ordering for ramond verma

as explained before, the main result we intend to extract from an adapted ordering is the
ordering kernel as the number of elements of the ordering kernel denes an upper limit for
the singular dimensions. secondly, the terms in the ordering kernel identify singular vectors
uniquely according to theorem 3.c and theorem 3.d. we nd the following result.

for the proof of theorem 3.g we follow the lines of the proof for the topological n = 2

algebra given in ref. 9.

m, n, k  n0, r1, r2  {0, 1}, such that l = m + n + k + r1 and p = (1)kg0k+r1+r2. we then
construct the vector 0 = x0 |i.

in the case g0 6= 1 we look at gk1 which necessarily has k1 > 1 and consider the
positive operator gk11. the commutation relations of gk1 and gk11 create a generator
l1. therefore,

the action of gk11 also creates at least one generator l1 in order to obtain x g or y has
more generators l1 than x0. in the latter case y <o x0. in the rst case, however, the action
of one positive operator can according to the commutation relations create at most one new
generator. we can therefore restrict ourselves to terms y of the form

or l = 1 in the case kl0k = 1. for any other term y  cp
we again nd that the action of lm11 creates exactly one additional l1 in order to obtain
x l or we have automatically y <o x0. if the additional l1 is created by commutation with

where also ry

the action of lm11 is via commutation with generators in ly . therefore ly needs to contain
an operator lm with m  m1 and therefore again y <o x0. thus

this completes the proof of the ordering kernels of table tab. a.

obviously, the only way of creating l1 by commuting g0 with products of generators in cp

is by commuting g0 directly with g1. therefore any other term y that creates x  under the
action of g0 and is not o-smaller than x0 would also need to create one l1 and thus also
1 = r1 = 1, besides ny = n. trivially, we nd in this case that y = x0. this proves the

as mentioned earlier, g-closed verma modules do not contain any g-closed singular vec-

3.d to nd upper limits for singular dimensions and to identify singular vectors. both will be
demonstrated in the following section.

4 singular dimensions and singular vectors in verma modules

over the n = 1 ramond algebra

theorem 3.c tells us that the dimension of spaces of singular vectors for a given level l and
parity p is bounded by the number of elements of the corresponding ordering kernel found in
the previous section. in appendix a we give all the singular vectors until level 3. in particular,
at level 3 we give explicit examples of two-dimensional singular vector spaces in (complete)
verma modules. the upper limits for the singular dimensions given by the ordering kernels
turn out to be maxima. we can therefore state that the ordering we have chosen is the best
possible since the results we have found cannot be improved by choosing any other ordering.
we easily deduce the following theorem from 3.g and 3.h which is surprisingly similar to the
corresponding results for the twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra10.

highest weight representations of the n = 1 ramond algebra

using theorem 3.d every singular vector in its normal form can be uniquely identied by
its components with respect to elements in the ordering kernel. all the other coecients of
a singular vector with respect to the standard basis are hence xed once the coecients on
the ordering kernel are known. however, it may be extremely hard to actually compute them
especially at very high levels. for the ramond algebra the so-called fusion method has been
used by watts22 to compute certain classes of ramond singular vectors explicitly.

in the introduction we mentioned that in the virasoro case it was sucient to compare the
level of two singular vectors in the same verma module in order to deduce whether they are
proportional. this important feature simplied the derivation of the embedding structure of
submodules12 and nally the connexion to the virasoro irreducible characters. our examples
in the appendix show that in the ramond case the simple comparison of weights is not su-
cient in order to decide if singular vectors are proportional and therefore the derivation of the
embedding structure and character formulae seems almost unmanageable if we do not know the
singular vectors explicitly. however, theorem 3.d reduces this problem to the knowledge of the
coecients with respect to the ordering kernel only. in the case of g-closed singular vectors
or singular vectors in g-closed verma modules this single coecient can always be normalised
to 1 - if the vector is non-trivial - and therefore for these cases we can almost proceed as in
the virsoro case. for singular vectors that are not g-closed in complete verma modules we
need to nd the two leading coecients. this will be done in the following section. however,
in order to analyse secondary singular vectors we need to nd product formulae for singular
vector operators. this can easily be achieved by taking into account all possible contributions
to leading terms. for example

(a1ll1

1 + b1ll11

due to this identity, all (primitive) singular vectors have been found once the vectors 
for p, q  n, q even and p odd have been given.

the examples in the appendix and computer exploration21 until level 6 show which of the
p,q(t) depending on p or q

two possibilities can be assigned to the primitive singular vectors 
being even or odd. we can therefore give the following conjecture.

according to theorem 5.b the singular vectors 

p,q only have two possible choices for their
coecients, therefore explicit computer calculations are a suciently convincing indication for
conjecture 5.b. a nal proof could follow in the line of watts22, using the fusion of conformal
elds in order to derive expressions for singular vectors. but for our purpose only two coecients
are needed and therefore the construction of watts should be applicable in a simplied form
and may only be needed for a particular limit of the parameter t.

the expressions of 5.b reveal once more striking similarities to the twisted n = 2 super-
conformal algebra. for the twisted n = 2 algebra the singular vectors also follow a choice of
two possible ordering kernel coecients10. they are also labelled by two integers r, s where r
plays the role of p and s the one of q, however s has to be odd. in the twisted n = 2 case, the
observed expressions for singular vectors always take an expression similar to eq. (89) whilst
the second possibility similar to eq. (88) never appears. considering the fact that s has to be
odd for the twisted n = 2 case and taking into account that q is odd for eq. (89), we observe
a rather close connexion between the n = 1 ramond case and the twisted n = 2 case.

let us note that the singular vectors of conjecture 5.b never vanish identically. this reveals
a signicant dierence with respect to the singular vectors of the three isomorphic n = 2
algebras, where discrete vanishings of the primitive singular vector expressions lead to the fact
that the two-dimensional tangent space is spanned by two secondaryo linearly independent
singular vectors6. in contrast, the primitive singular vector expressions for the twisted n = 2
algebra never vanish10, like for the n = 1 ramond algebra.

based on conjecture 5.b it is easy to compute the verma modules with degenerate singular
vectors, i.e. with singular spaces of dimension 2. for a given level l  n there are normally
multiple solutions to the number theoretical problem pq = 2l, p, q  n, p  q odd. solutions
with p even are said to be of type  = + whilst for q even we assign type  = . in the general
case one factorises the integer 2l in its prime factors

are then given by

p =

,

ofor example, in the case of the n = 2 neveu-schwarz algebra the spaces of linearly independent
singular vectors are always uncharged and are secondary singular vectors of charged singular vectors at
lower levels.

solution is indicated with a superscript . note that for each level l  n there exist at least
two solutions: p = 2l, q = 1 and p = 1, q = 2l. the number of solutions to pq = 2l, p, q  n,
p  q odd is thus determined by the number of p -tuples  = (k1, . . . , kp ) with   np
0 and
  (n1, . . . , np ) for the prime factorisation of 2l. hence, there arep l = 2qp

solutions to pq = 2l, p, q  n, p  q odd.

the proof of theorem 2.l sheds light on the fact that there are generically only one-
dimensional singular spaces dened by the singular vectors +
2 for all
l solutions p and q. the most interesting verma modules are those, where some of these l
solutions intersect and may hence lead to two-dimensional singular spaces provided the corre-
sponding singular vectors are not proportional. using conjecture 5.b we shall now investigate
such cases of degeneration. let us remark again that the singular dimension cannot be bigger
than 2 (the size of the ordering kernel) even though a priori we would expect that even more
than 2 solutions i could intersect.

intersections of equal type singular vectors occur for the rst time at level 3 when 1,6

highest weight representations of the n = 1 ramond algebra

of singular vectors and therefore do not lead to any degenerate levels. in appendix a we give all
primitive singular vectors until level 3 and indicate explicitly the degenerate singular vectors.
so far, degenerate singular vector spaces had only been discovered for the n = 2 superconformal
algebras6, 15, 10, and the fact that also the n = 1 ramond algebra leads to degenerate singular
vector spaces in its highest weight representations has been overlooked in the past. let us
stress that for the n = 2 isomorphic algebras (neveu-schwarz, topological and ramond) the
degenerate singular vectors found so far are always secondary whereas for the n = 2 twisted
algebra and for the n = 1 ramond algebra the degenerate singular vectors are generically
primitiveq.

the multiplication rules of theorem 4.c together with the identication of the singular
vectors with their ordering kernel coecients supply the fundamental tools needed to investigate
the structure of embedded singular vectors and descendant singular vectors and hence the
embedding diagrams. in the following section, we show that theorem 4.c allows us to follow
the lines of feigin and fuchs12, who discussed the virasoro case, to extend their approach to
the ramond algebra using the results of this section. in a rst analysis we will comment on
the main similarities for the rational models (t  q) with the virasoro case but we will also
reveal certain major dierences. a complete discussion and derivation of all ramond embedding
diagrams will be given in a forthcoming paper4.

6 descendant singular vectors.

in the previous sections we have discussed that a singular vector l1 |1i of the verma module
v1 generates a submodule homomorphic to v1+l1. on the other hand v1+l1 may again
contain a singular vector l2 |1 + l1i. in this section we want to focus on the resulting vector
l2l1 |1i, which - if non-trivial - is again a singular vector, called a descendant or secondary
singular vector, as was explained before. descendant singular vectors that are proportional
are considered to be equal. the relative structure of the singular vectors and their descending
patterns are usually given in so-called embedding diagrams. embedding diagrams are important
to nd out the dimension of the null submodule of a verma module and are hence crucial for
the character formulae of the irreducible highest weight representations. embedding diagrams
include all singular vectors and usually - if applicable - also subsingular vectors. the diagrams
indicate which singular vectors appear as descendant singular vectors of others and proportional
singular vectors are indicated as one singular vector only.

for the virasoro algebra the derivation of the embedding diagrams12 is merely a matter
of solving the number theoretical problem for which levels the roots of the kac determinant
formula predict a singular vector and of comparing the relative levels of these singular vectors
to reveal the embedding pattern. this procedure is rather simple due to the properties of
virasoro algebra that does not allow two or more virasoro singular vectors at the same level
in the same verma module. hence virasoro singular vectors at the same level in the same
verma module are always proportional. as a remark, let us add that also for the virasoro
case for a given level l  n0 we have dierent one-parameter families of singular vectors p,q(t)
that intersect for certain values of t, pairs (p1, q1), and (p2, q2) at the same level p1q1 = p2q2.
however, for virasoro verma modules these singular vectors at such intersection points are
always linearly dependent12, 18, 9. furthermore, for the virasoro algebra the products of singular
vector operators never vanish and also virasoro verma modules do not contain any subsingular
vectors. all these non-trivial properties make the derivation of virasoro embedding diagrams
straightforward.

qwe are very grateful to b. gato-rivera for pointing this out to us.

highest weight representations of the n = 1 ramond algebra

25

for superconformal algebras most of these remarkable properties of the virasoro algebra
may not hold. products of singular vector operators may vanish identically, a very common
consequence of lie superalgebras, singular spaces may be bigger than just one-dimensional
and subsingular vectors may also arise. such features have recently been discussed for the
n = 2 superconformal algebras14, 15, 9, 10, 6, 5.
in this section we will show that the ramond
algebra also shares some of these diculties and we will discuss the derivation of the most
interesting embedding diagrams, the rational models. a full consideration of the ramond
embedding diagrams shall be given elsewhere4. the multiplication rules of theorem 4.c and the
expressions of 5.b will prove to be the main tools for the analysis of the ramond embedding
diagrams. with their help it will be possible to nd out which descendant singular vectors are
identical and which are trivial.

like in the virasoro case12 and the n = 2 neveu-schwarz case5 we rst compute for a

given verma module v and a central parameter t the intercept a as

a2 = 8t 

5t
2

+ 1 + t2 .

(102)

the sign of a is not relevant but for real a we choose a positive. in the case that  = p,q
for p, q  n, p  q odd, we obviously nd (q  pt)2 = a2. a vanishing a-value corresponds to
the supersymmetric case  = c
24 which will be analysed in much detail in the following section.
therefore, a = 0 shall be excluded for the rest of this section. conversely, if for given values of
t and a we are looking for the integers p, q that solve  = p,q, then we nd as solutions all p,
q with

q = pt  a , p, q  z , p  q odd , pq > 0.

(103)

for these values of (p, q) we have the required |p|,|q| =  with p = |p|, q = |q| and hence p  q
odd. note that we distinguish p, q from p, q as the latter are also allowed to be negative as
long as their product stays positive. just like in the virasoro case12 the problem reduces to
nding the integer pair solutions (p, q) on the straight line l: q = pt  a with positive product
pq. in contrast to the virasoro case we require here the dierence p  q to be odd. the cases of
irrational t are simple and will be included in a full discussion on the embedding diagrams in a
forthcoming publication4, the cases of rational t are however very interesting. these so-called
rational models shall be analysed here. we therefore assume t  q and nd the unique pair of
integers (u, v) with u, v coprime and v positive such that t = u
v .

if l has no integer pair solutions at all or only integer pair solutions with p  q even, then
the verma module v(a,t) is obviously irreducible as the determinant formula is non-trivial for
in the case that l has at least one integer pair solution with p  q odd, then it
all levels.
obviously has innitely many. in the notation of feigin and fuchs12 these cases are denoted by
iii for positive t and iii+ for negativer values of t. our task is now to describe among these
innitely many solutions those solutions (p, q) with pq > 0 and p  q odd. for this purpose it
is essential to distinguish two dierent cases for which we shall add the label e for even or o for
odd to iii. thus iiie denotes the case where one of u or v is even (but obviously not both)
whilst iiio stands for the cases with both u and v odd.

let us rst concentrate on t positive. the integer pair solution of l with p  q odd, both p
and q positive, and the smallest for p is denoted by (p0, q0). likewise, the integer pair solution of
l with p  q odd, both p and q negative, and the smallest value of |p| is denoted by (p0, q0).
we can now easily give all other allowed solutions:

pn = p0 + nv

,

qn = q0 + nu ,

pn = p0  nv

, qn = q0  nu ,

(104)

(105)

rnote the opposite denition of the index of iii and the sign of t for historical reasons.

with n  n0 for the case of iiio. however, for iiie we only nd every other point as a solution
and hence n  2n0. therefore, we can already state that the verma module vp0,q0 contains
singular vectors at the levels pnqn
for all n  n0 in the case iiio but only for n  2n0
2
for iiie. for all the solutions of type (pn, qn) we have q  tp = a whilst for (pn, qn) we
obtain q  tp = a which xes already one of the coecients of 5.b for each case. we shall
now investigate descendant singular vectors of these primitive singular vectors and shall use the
multiplication rules of theorem 4.c to compare their ordering kernel coecients.

and pn qn

along this line, we rst look at the singular vector +

p0,q0. its highest weight p0,q0 + p0q0
2
leads to a parameter a, which is related to the original a for p0,q0 through: a = a + 2q0. for
the descendant singular vectors we hence have to solve exactly the same number theoretical
problem, namely nding integer solutions on the straight line q = pt  a. this again resembles
the virasoro case12, however, a main dierence in our case is that we have to take into account
the implications of the two subcases iiie and iiio.

figure i shows that in the case of iiio the two lowest level solutions of this shifted straight
line are (p0 + v, q0 + u) (if q0 6= u) and (p0, q0  2q0) which again both satisfy that the
dierence of the p-value and the q-value is odd. in the case that q0 = u the former solution
changes to (p0 +2v, u). this case shall be denoted by iii0(u)
o . in the same way we can analyse the
shifted straight line for the singular vector +
which results in the two lowest level solutionss
(p0 + 2p0, q0) and (p0  v, q0  u) (for p0 6= v). in the case of p0 = v the latter changes to
(v, q0  2u) which shall be denoted by iii0(v)

again, the multiplication rules 4.c easily prove that +

p1,q1 and +

h are proportional and also
the pair +
g . furthermore, the results of the multiplication show that the latter pair of
singular vectors is proportional to +
p1,q1. therefore,
after having reached singular vectors of the original straight line l (+
p1,q1) the whole
procedure starts again and ultimately exhausts all (innitely many) singular vectorsu. so far,
this reminds us very much of the virasoro case12 but we should keep in mind that dierently to
the virasoro case the multiplication rules 4.c were crucial to prove this embedding structure.
we will summarise this structure in the embedding diagrams given below in theorem 6.a. before
o and iii0(v)
continuing to the case iiie we shall discuss what happens in the special cases iii0(u)
o .
according to the solutions on the shifted straight lines given above for the case iii0(u)
o we nd
that the singular vector +

a has to be replaced by
p0+2v,u+

a = +

+

p0,q0 |p0,q0i .

p0,q0 whilst +

a is already proportional to +

o (q0 = u) we hence nd that +

taking into account that p0 is even for iii0(u)
d becomes propor-
tional to +
p1,q1, again by using our multiplication
rules. therefore the above embedding pattern collapses in the way indicated in theorem 6.a.
similarly, for the cases iii0(v)
o the vectors +
d is al-
p1,q1 resulting in almost the same embedding patterns as for iii0(u)
ready proportional to +
o .
finally, if both conditions hold, q0 = u and p0 = v, we obtain the proportionalities of both
cases. this case shall be denoted by iii00
o following the notation of feigin and fuchs12. let
us nally mention that for the cases iiio+ with negative, rational t we nd exactly the same
patterns except that the embedding patterns come to an end just like in the virasoro case. in
gure i this corresponds to solutions in the regions with pq < 0 and therefore the number of
solutions has to be nite. we have hence proven that the descendant singular vectors of the
primitive singular vectors have the following embedding patterns.

become proportional whilst +

a and +

p0,q0

theorem 6.a for the subsets iiio, iii0(u)
24 ) we nd
the following embedding patterns for descendant singular vectors of the type +
p,q in the positive
parity sector. the negative parity sector leads to exactly the same diagrams. the zero mode
g0 interpolates between the embedding diagrams of the positive parity sector and the negative
parity sector.

tnote that not all combinations of types are possible. if for example +

p0,q0 is of type  = +, then
+
p0+v,uq0 has to be of type  = . indeed, wrong type combinations do not lead to proportional singular
vectors in some of the following cases.

uthe fact that these are all singular vectors will be explained in ref. 4

in the following we analyse in the same way the cases iiie which means that either u or
v (but not both) is odd. in this case not every integral point pair on the straight line l leads
to a singular vector because the addition of u and v to q0 and p0 respectively changes p  q
from odd to even. hence, only every other integral point pair on the straight line l satises the
condition p  q odd. at rst, this seems to complicate our analysis. however, it turns out that
the only dierence is that v and u need to be replaced by 2v and 2u respectively. analysing
descending solutions of p0,q0 and p0,q0 we obtain the following gure.

it is worth noting that in the cases iiie the singular vectors of one embedding diagram are
always of the same type whilst for iiio they can be of dierent type. as before, we can easily
dene the descendant singular vectors of rst and second order analogous to the eqs. (106)-
(113) simply by replacing v and u by 2v and 2u respectively everywhere in the index of the

highest weight representations of the n = 1 ramond algebra

vectors. in this way we obtain for example the singular vectors

we can again use the multiplication rules of 4.c to obtain exactly the same proportionalities
as above. the main dierence, however, is that the embedding pattern does not collapse for
q0 = u and neither for p0 = v as it does for iiio and also for the virasoro case. nevertheless,
the embedding pattern does simplify to the single line pattern for q0 = 2u and for p0 = 2v. for
example, in the former case the vector

+

a = +

p0+4v,2u+

p0,q0 |p0,q0i ,

(117)

e

is proportional to +

p2,q2 and +
becomes proportional to +
p0,q0. we shall denote these special
d
cases by iii0(2u)
and iii0(2v)
correspondingly. let us note that q0 = 2u and p0 = 2v results in
2uq0
v and therefore either q0 or p0 must be even. this is related to the fact that the
2vp0
singular vector solutions for iiie are always of the same type. but since q0 and p0 are both
even this leads to a contradiction. therefore, cases of the type iii00(2u)(2v)
do not exist. we
e
have therefore proven the results contained in the following theorem.

parity sector.

as explained, the main dierence to the embedding patterns of the virasoro case is that
the cases iiie do not simplify to the single line embedding patterns for q0 = u or p0 = v. by
grouping these cases together with the types iiie, we have dened our notation iii0
e in such
a way that the resulting embedding patterns seem similar to the virasoro case. let us now
analyse some of these special cases further. q0 = u and p0 = v easily implies (a v
u + v, u) and

30

highest weight representations of the n = 1 ramond algebra

u + v, u) or (a v

(v, a  u) as the two lowest level solutions. the corresponding singular vectors are hence
both at the level av + uv. conversely, p0q0 = p0 q0 implies that the two intercepts a and a
t
are both integers. therefore, we have only two possibilities for each of the points (p0, q0) and
(p0, q0) which for the former are for example (a v
u + 2v, 2u). however, equality
of the levels is only possible for q0 = u and p0 = v. therefore the subset of these special
cases which satisfy both q0 = u and p0 = v correspond exactly to the cases where two curves
of primitive singular vectors intersect at the same level. the values of t for these cases were
given in eq. (95) as t =  q1
if the two intersecting primitive singular vectors are
p2
of dierent type , then u and v would obviously be both odd and therefore the embedding
diagram would go over to the straight line embedding pattern in accordance with our earlier
result that intersections of singular vectors of dierent type do not lead to degenerate singular
states. however, if the two intersecting singular vectors are of the same type then consequently
t =  q1
implies that u and v cannot both be odd and therefore we obtain case iiie.
p2
the corresponding embedding diagram does not simplify to the straight line pattern as in the
virasoro case, which clearly shows the degenerate singular vectors.

p1

.

theorem 6.c the verma modules with degenerate singular vectors given by the intersection
of 2 curves of primitive singular vectors of the same type at the same level are exactly the cases
iiie with q0 = u and p0 = v. the corresponding embedding diagrams do not simplify to a
straight line pattern but stay as the crossed embedding pattern given in gure iv.

c

p,q always annihilate g0(cid:12)(cid:12)

the embedding diagrams given above are equally valid for the positive parity sector and
24 . as we will see in
24 the singular vector operators of the primitive singular vectors
24(cid:11). therefore, these modules do not contain two parallel embedding

the negative parity sector with the only exception of the special case  = c
the following section, for  = c

structures of singular vectors of the crossed type, but only one. however, as we shall also show
in the following section, we then obtain subsingular vectors in v c
. therefore one part of the
24
parallel embedding structure is not given by singular vectors but by subsingular vectors. let us
also mention that the operator g0 always interpolates between the two corresponding vectors
of the parallel embedding structures except for the cases when some of the singular vectors
become g-closed. the conditions for g-closed singular vectors will be analysed in section 8. a
complete set of ramond embedding patterns with the interpolation of the two parity sectors
will be given in ref. 4

let us nally identify the unitary minimal models among the cases of our analysis. the
conditions for the ramond unitary minimal models were rst given by friedan et al.13. they
correspond to the central parameter t = m+2
m with m  n but m 6= 1 and  = p,q with the
integer pair (p, q), 0 < p  m  1, 0 < q  m + 1, p  q odd. obviously, the highest common
factor of m and m + 2 is 2 for m even and 1 for m odd. for m even we therefore have u = m
2 + 1
and v = m
2 whilst for m odd we obtain u = m + 2 and v = m. consequently, we nd for m
even that the solutions (p0, q0) and (p0, q0) satisfy the conditions 0 < p0, p0  m  1 < 2v,
0 < q0, q0  m + 1 < 2u and for m odd 0 < p0, p0  m  1 < v, 0 < q0, q0  m + 1 < u.
therefore, the unitary minimal models for  6= c
24 (a 6= 0) are of type iiie for m even and of
type iiio for m odd. the corresponding embedding diagrams are always of the crossed type.
this nally proves for  6= c
24 the only n = 1 ramond embedding diagrams that had been
conjectured in the literature so far19 for the unitary minimal models. note that none of these
cases has degenerate singular levels since t = q0
implies p0 = p0 and q0 = q0 and thus
p0
a = 0. therefore, we should stress that the conditions of the critical cases of iiie of theorem 6.c
lead for the unitary minimal models to the excluded case a = 0. hence, embedding diagrams
of the unitary minimal supersymmetric cases, i.e. with  = c
24 do not have the embedding
diagrams of singular vectors given in the literature19. their embedding patterns change and in

be considered in more detail in this section. at rst, it seems that this quotient module is only
one of many quotient modules one may want to consider. we could also consider quotients with
respect to modules generated by singular vectors 
2 . however, the supersymmetric
quotient module is special as we shall explain at the end of this section.

in a forthcoming publication11 it will be shown that the existence of singular vector oper-
ators with vanishing product leads to the appearance of subsingular vectors. in the supersym-
metric case we have g2
. via the canonical map dened for quotient spaces, singular vectors from v c
vectors in v c
24
24
are either also singular in v g
or they lie in the kernel of the quotient and hence vanish in the
quotient space. the latter happens if and only if the singular vector in question is a descendant
vector of the singular vector 
can either be inherited
from v c
24

24(cid:11)  0 and therefore we expect the possibility of having subsingular

via the canonical quotient map or they appear for the rst time in the quotient v g

. in the latter case these singular vectors of v g

vectors that were not singular in v c
are called
24
. whilst for the virasoro algebra12 and for the n = 1 neveu-schwarz
subsingular vectors in v c
24
algebra2 there are no subsingular vectors, they have been found for all n = 2 superconformal
algebras by gato-rivera et al.14, 15, 10. the fact that the n = 1 ramond algebra also contains
subsingular vectors - at least in the supersymmetric case - shall be demonstrated here. this
may at rst seem surprising and conrms the obvious problems encountered so far with n = 1
ramond theories. however, we shall argue that subsingular vectors are likely to be restricted
to the (extended) supersymmetric case which is though a very particular and highly interesting
case.

singular dimensions for g-closed verma modules are less than or equal to 1 as shown in
section 4. hence, there cannot be any degenerate singular vectors in g-closed verma modules
and furthermore, two singular vectors in a g-closed verma module at the same level and with
the same parity must be proportional. a singular vector of a g-closed verma module at level l

32

can therefore be identied by one coecient only, which is the coecient with respect to ll

respectively, when written in the normal form, then this vector is trivial.

we have shown that the singular vectors 

p,q disappear in the kernel of the quotient module
for the g-closed case. however, based on their singular vector operators we can construct
and thus the singular vectors in the g-closed verma module v g
subsingular vectors in v c
.
24
for the case that 
p,q leads to a two-dimensional singular space one would most likely obtain
a two-dimensional singular space in the corresponding g-closed verma module which would
contradict theorem 7.a. therefore, 2-dimensional singular spaces dened by the intersection
p,q are not allowed for t = tp,q. this can easily be seen by requiring t = q1
of vectors 
and
p1
t = q1
. the rst condition takes care of the g-closed case and the second condition arises
p2
from the intersection of two such vectors. this leads to (p1, q1) = (p2, q2) and therefore excludes
the existence of degenerate cases for the g-closed verma modules. even more interestingly due
to p  q odd exactly one of the coprime factors (u, v) of t = u
v has to be even. furthermore,
since a = 0 the straight line l is point symmetric in the origin and the negative solutions
(pn, qn) are exactly the same as the positive solutions (pn, qn). they are simply given by
(pn, qn) = (v + nv, u + nu) with n  2n0. since (0, 0) is on the straight line l these are the
only possible reducible verma modules having a = 0. thus, reducible g-closed verma modules
always belong to type iiie. however, their structure is quite dierent from the structure of
the verma modules of type iiie with a 6= 0. therefore, we shall use the notation iii
e. the
reason why their structure is dierent to iiie is mainly due to the fact that the positive and
negative solutions are not only at the same level but they are the same and therefore do not
lead to degenerate singular vectors as we would expect it from the cases iiie. the degeneracy
of null-vectors is for iii

e obtained through the subsingular vectors of theorem 7.b.

c
24

c
24

in ref. 11, it will be shown that for superconformal algebras the existence of subsingular
vectors is often a consequence of additional discrete vanishing conditions on an embedded
singular vector. to understand this, let us assume that we have given a singular vector l(t) at
level l along the curve  = (t). this singular vector generates an embedded verma module
built on l.
if for a discrete point t0 the singular vector satises an additional vanishing
condition l0l  0 at level l0, then the embedded verma module has to be smaller at this level
compared to the generic cases along  = (t). since null-vectors correspond to the kernel of
the inner product matrix and the dimension of this kernel is upper semi-continuous, there must
exist for this discrete case an additional null-vector at level l + l0 outside the embedded module
built on l in order to compensate for this embedded module shrinking at level l + l0. this
additional null-vector is usually a subsingular vector. as shown for the n = 2 superconformal
algebrasv in some cases they may, however, also be ordinary singular vectors8, 11. this argument
is explained in more detail in ref. 11, where it is also shown that only singular vector operators
need to be considered in order to nd possible vanishing conditions on singular vectors. we
therefore conclude this section by analysing the products of singular vector operators and the

we consider products of the form 

2 = p1,q1.
there are four cases to be considered depending on the parities of the two singular vector
operators indicated by  as ++, +, +, or  for the parities of 
p2,q2. we write
pi,qi = (ai, bi)

in the notation of denition 4.b and use the product expressions of 4.c.
requiring that one of these product expressions vanishes identically, which means that both
coecients with respect to the ordering kernel vanish for the product, leads to the conditions

hence, in this case the operator 
0 . as expected, these are exactly the
cases for which we have found the subsingular vectors given above in this section. our earlier
explanation that an additional vanishing condition on 
0 is responsible for these subsingular
vectors does, however, not apply in this case since the vanishing of 
0 is not an additional
vanishing condition on 
p,q can be written
as 
p,qg0 as shown earlier. nevertheless, exactly these cases contain subsingular vectors. the
other cases in theorem 7.d are cases when vectors 
p,q become g-closed and as we shall show
in the following section that these are all such cases. in this context, one automatically raises
the question whether there are subsingular vectors appearing for the case that 
p,q becomes
g-closed. this interesting question will be analysed in the following section. finally, let us
remark that theorem 7.c states that besides the g-closed cases and the supersymmetric cases
there are no trivial products of singular vector operators given by 5.b. however, if these singular
vector operators form a 2-dimensional space it could well be that a linear combination of two
such operators may lead to a trivial product by acting on another singular vector. by noting
that the operators (a, b)+
l are elements of a (larger) algebra with operations 4.c in which all
operators are invertible except for the g-closed and supersymmetric cases, we nd that such
vanishing products are only possible for these cases. we therefore do not have any further
subsingular vectors arising in the way described above. furthermore we can state that there
are no subsingular vectors in verma modules v other than the ones found in v c
. a rigorous
proof for this claim will be presented in ref. 4 using a detailed analysis of the multiplicities of
the roots of the determinant together with the results of theorem 7.c and 7.d.

the same levels. however, as explained above, one dimension of this 2-dimensional space is
being projected out in the product on +
p2,q2.
this single line embedding pattern for the singular vectors is, however, complemented by the
subsingular vectors and their descendants. again, g0 interpolates between identical embedding
patterns for the dierent parity sectors.

p0,q0 and the resulting singular vector equals +

to conclude this subsection we note that if we had started o with (unextended) verma
modules v 
 , then we would have not found these subsingular vectors of the complete verma
module in the supersymmetric case  = 0 as v 
0 is simply the above quotient module. on the
other hand, in our search for irreducible representations we might as well start o using this
quotient module rather than the full (extended) verma module for  = 0. hence we have shown
that for the irreducible highest weight representations also in the supersymmetric case  = c
24
the highest weight vector can be chosen to be an eigenvector of g0. we can therefore state
that for all irreducible highest weight representations of the ramond algebra r1 we may choose
highest weight vectors that are eigenvectors of g0 in both the extended and the unextended
case. in the former case we nd the condition (1)f |i = |i. however, g0 may not be
completely diagonalisable on the highest weight module for   c

that we only need to look at singular vector operators and their descendants whilst dealing with
additional vanishing conditions is proven in ref. 11. hence, the embedded modules generated

leads for both parities to the zero vector (0, 0)

p,q(t) may be g-closed it turns out that it really is. furthermore, the ordering kernels for
g-closed singular vectors, given in table tab. b, are just one-dimensional and therefore g-closed

9 conclusions and prospects

by introducing an adapted ordering on the weight spaces of ramond verma modules we derived
the ordering kernels of the n = 1 ramond algebra. these ordering kernels contain in the most
general cases two elements and consequently ramond singular vectors are uniquely dened by
just two particular coecients. in addition, ramond singular vector spaces can be degenerate
(2-dimensional). we derived expressions for these two coecients for all primitive ramond
singular vectors. it turned out that these two coecients are closed under multiplication. the
corresponding multiplication formulae therefore yield the whole ramond embedding diagrams.

we argued that the structure of the highest weight representations of the (extended) ra-
mond algebra can easily be transformed into the corresponding representations of the unex-
tended ramond algebra. the only case where this transformation breaks down is the super-
symmetric case  = c
24 for which the unextended module is already the quotient module of the
extended module divided by its level 0 singular vector. in some of these cases we nd that the
(extended) verma module has subsingular vectors but not the unextended verma module. we
argued further that one should not expect any other subsingular vectors. this was related to
the fact that the product of singular vector operators has proven to be always non-trivial with
the only exception of the supersymmetric case  = c
24 . a rigorous proof of this claim will be
given in ref. 4 through a detailed analysis of the multiplicities of the roots of the determinant
and their intersections.

the embedding diagram patterns proven in this paper reveal that the derivation of ra-
mond embedding diagrams is signicantly more complicated than in the virasoro case and the
conjectures given in the literature19 for the ramond unitary models can only be proven by using
the multiplication rules for singular vector operators derived via the ordering kernel coecients.
we showed that degenerate singular vector spaces do appear for the ramond algebra which
arise from ordering kernels with two elements. the structure of the embedding diagrams is very
similar to the virasoro embedding diagrams, nevertheless the rules for embedding patterns to
collapse to simpler patterns are very dierent than in the virasoro case. as a consequence, we

highest weight representations of the n = 1 ramond algebra

37

have embedding diagrams where the two lowest level singular vectors are at the same level but
the embedding diagram still does not simplify to the straight line embedding diagram - as it
would do in the virsoro case - but simply stays as the typical crossed embedding pattern of
conformal rational models.

we have once more demonstrated that the adapted ordering method is a very simple
mechanism that uniquely denes all singular vectors and reveals much information about the
embedding structure of the verma modules. one easily manages even complications through
subsingular vectors and degenerate singular vectors and nally obtains the whole structure
of the embedding patterns. in principle, it should easily generalise to any other kind of lie
(super)-algebra.

it was shown that the n = 1 ramond algebra contains many of the interesting features that
had only been discovered for the n = 2 superconformal algebras so far. surprisingly enough,
the results obtained for the n = 1 ramond algebra resemble much more the corresponding
results for the twisted n = 2 algebra than for the ramond n = 2 algebra. these facts are one
more reason to claim that ramond eld theories are still much less understood than neveu-
schwarz eld theories. nevertheless, the structure nally proven has still much in common with
the virasoro structure and the n = 1 neveu-schwarz structure.

explicit expressions for the singular vectors 
 for 2 =

vectors can easily be transformed to the basis used in this paper via the basis transformation
discussed earlier. in this section of the appendix we shall give all singular vectors in vp,q until
level 3. with the exception of 
1,q (and its symmetric
partners) given by watts in the unextended basis. as mentioned earlier, at level 3 we observe
for the rst time degenerate singular vectors arising from the intersection of 
2,3 and
also from the intersection of 
3,2. let us note again that intersections of singular
vectors of dierent type  (see theorem 5.c), such as 
1,2 only lead to one-dimensional
singular spaces. by explicit calculations21 one nds the following singular vectors for parity +.

besides the vectors p,q we should - of course - have at least also found the descendant
singular vectors p1,q1p2,q2 for p1,q1 = p2,q2 + p2q2
and descendants thereof. the latter
2
equation simplies to t = q1q2
. if the two vectors are of dierent type, then obviously the
p2p1
values for t in question have t = u
v with u and v both odd. furthermore, at level 1, 2, and
3 all possible cases simplify to either iii0(u)
o and hence the corresponding embedding
patterns contain descendant singular vectors already among the pattern for the (generically)
primitive singular vectors.
in the case that the two singular vectors are of the same type,
we obtain both numerator and denominator of t even and hence one of u or v may or may
not be even. for the levels 1, 2, 3 these cases are (p1, q1) = (1, 4), (p2, q2) = (1, 2) with the
corresponding values for t = 1 or (p1, q1) = (1, 2), (p2, q2) = (1, 4) with t = 1. hence both
cases again contain no additional descendant singular vectors at level 3. therefore there are no
additional descendant singular vectors until level 3. the rst examples of descendant singular
vectors not contained in the pattern of (generically) primitive singular vectors appear at level
4, for example for (p1, q1) = (1, 6), (p2, q2) = (1, 2) with t = 2 which is of type iiie and does
not simplify to the straight line embedding pattern.

we conclude this section of the appendix with all singular vectors of negative parity at level
1, 2, and 3 . the above remarks about degenerate singular vectors and descendant singular
vectors are equally valid for these cases. also for the negative parity vectors the condition


t ) holds and we hence give the singular vectors only for q even.
