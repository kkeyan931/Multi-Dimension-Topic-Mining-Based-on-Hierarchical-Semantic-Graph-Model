abstract

we formulate a systematic bethe-ansatz approach for computing bound-state (breather)

s matrices for integrable quantum spin chains. we use this approach to calculate the
breather boundary s matrix for the open xxz spin chain with diagonal boundary
elds. we also compute the soliton boundary s matrix in the critical regime.

1 introduction

a common feature of integrable models is the existence of bound states for a certain range of
the coupling constant. a well-known example is the sine-gordon/massive thirring model,
which in the attractive regime (0 < 2 < 4) exhibits soliton-antisoliton bound states called
breathers. (see e.g.
[1] and references therein.) the direct bethe-ansatz calculation of
exact scattering matrices for both solitons (also known as kinks or holes) and breathers
was pioneered by korepin [2]. andrei and destri [3] later systematized such s matrix
calculations for the solitons. we develop here a corresponding systematic approach for
computing s matrices for the breathers. in particular, we give a direct calculation of the
breather boundary s matrix for the open xxz spin chain with diagonal boundary elds
[4],[5]. our results coincide with the bootstrap results for the boundary sine-gordon model
[6] with xed boundary conditions which were obtained by ghoshal [7]. we also give
a direct computation of the soliton boundary s matrix in the critical regime [6],[8] using
the method developed in [9],[10]. although we focus on the xxz chain, we expect that
our method of computing bound-state s matrices should be applicable to other integrable
quantum spin chains.

bulk calculations are generally more straightforward than corresponding boundary cal-
culations. we therefore rst formulate in section 2 the method of computing breather s
matrices for the case of bulk (two-particle) scattering in the closed xxz chain, and thereby
reproduce the well-known results [1], [2], [11]. in section 3 we turn to the open xxz chain.
we compute the breather boundary s matrix, and nd agreement with the bootstrap results
provided a certain identication of boundary parameters is made. in order to further check
this identication, we also compute the soliton boundary s matrix. a brief comparison of
our approach with that of other authors is given in section 4.

2 closed xxz chain

in this section we consider the periodic anisotropic heisenberg (or closed xxz ) spin chain
in the critical regime, whose hamiltonian is given by [11],[12],[13]

h =

xn=1nx

n+1 + y

(2.1)

with 0 <  < 
2 and  = 1. we also assume that the number of spins (n) is even. it can be
shown (see e.g. [8],[11],[14]) that the kink s matrix coincides with the sine-gordon soliton

1

s matrix [1], provided that the sine-gordon coupling constant 2 is identied as

(2.2)

2 = 


since we restrict the anisotropy parameter  to the range (0 , 
2 ), it follows that the case
 = +1 corresponds to the repulsive regime (4 < 2 < 8) of the sine-gordon model
in which there are no bound states, while  = 1 corresponds to the attractive regime
(0 < 2 < 4) in which bound states do exist.

choosing the pseudovacuum to be the ferromagnetic state with all spins up, the algebraic
bethe ansatz [15] can be used to construct simultaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian,
momentum, and sz. the corresponding eigenvalues are given by 1

2.1 ground state

in order to study the breathers, we must consider the attractive case  = 1. the ground
state lies in the sector with n even, and is characterized by a sea of m = n
2 negative-parity
2 , where the center 0 is real) [13]. we briey review
1-strings (i.e., roots of the form 0 + i
the procedure for determining the root density, which describes the distribution of roots in
the thermodynamic (n  ) limit. the bethe ansatz eqs. (2.6) for the ground state are

g1( ; )n =

m

y=1

6=

e2(   ; ) ,  = 1 ,    , m ,

(2.14)

with {} real. by taking logarithms, these equations can be rewritten as

h() = j ,

(2.15)

2our conventions are

f () z 



ei f () d ,

f () =

and we use  to denote the convolution

1

2 z 



ei f () d ,

(f  g) () =z 



f (  ) g() d .

where the so-called counting function h() is given by

h() =

(2.16)

nr1( ; )

q2(   ; )


and {j} are certain integers or half-integers. the sign of the counting function is chosen so
as to make it a monotonically increasing function of . the root density () is dened by

() =

n

d
d

h() ,

(2.17)

so that the number of  in the interval [ ,  + d] is n()d. it is a positive function
by virtue of the monotonicity of the counting function. passing from the sum in h() to an
integral, we obtain a linear integral equation for the root density

() = b1( ; ) +z 



d() a2(   ; ) .

(2.18)

solving this equation by fourier transforms using eqs. (2.11),(2.12) , we conclude that the
root density for the ground state is given by

() = s() =

2.2 two-breather state

as for the massive thirring/sine-gordon model [2], the xxz chain in the attractive regime
has two classes of excitations above the ground-state sea: holes which correspond to solitons,
and strings which correspond to soliton-antisoliton bound states, i.e., breathers. the nth
breather corresponds to a positive-parity n-string; i.e., a set of n roots of the bethe ansatz
eqs. of the form

(n,l) = 0 +

i
2

(n + 1  2l) ,

l = 1 , . . . , n ,

(2.23)

where the center 0 is real. in particular, the fundamental breather (n = 1) corresponds to a
real root of the bethe ansatz equations. breather states exist only for n  {1 , . . . , []  1},
where [x] denotes integer part of x (see [2],[13]).

we consider now an excited state consisting of two breathers (n1,l1)

(with centers
2, respectively) in the sea, again with n even. the bethe ansatz eqs. (2.6) now

indeed, a hole (soliton) with rapidity  can be shown to have energy  sin 
 s(). we also
remark that charge conjugation (c) and parity (p) eigenvalues can be readily computed using
the methods described in ref. [14]. indeed, we nd that the ground state is an eigenstate of
2 n; and if the
c and p with eigenvalue ()
rapidity is zero this state is also a parity eigenstate with p = ()

2 . moreover, an n-breather state has c = ()

2 n.

the preceding analysis, which is fairly standard, relied on only the rst set (2.24) of
bethe ansatz equations. in order to compute the two-breather s matrix, we also exploit the
second set (2.25) of bethe ansatz eqs., which describes the centers of the breather strings.

this coincides with the sine-gordon breather s matrix [1],[2], provided that we make the
identication 2 = 8 which we have already noted (2.2). the breather s matrix has been
obtained for the xxz chain previously using the so-called physical bethe ansatz eqs.
in
[11].

3.1 one-breather state

we consider again the attractive case  = 1. for values of  in the range (3.5), there are
no boundary strings; and hence, the ground state is a sea of negative-parity 1-strings, as
already discussed for the closed chain in section 2.1.

in order to compute the breather boundary s matrix, we consider the bethe ansatz state

consisting of one breather (n,l)

it can be shown that this result agrees with ghoshals bootstrap result [7] for the breather
boundary s matrix for the boundary sine-gordon model with xed boundary conditions,
provided that we make the identication of bulk coupling constants 2 = 8 (see eq. (2.2)),
as well as the identication of boundary parameters 5

x =



2 (cid:16)2(1)  (cid:17) .

(3.24)

in this formula we have restored the superscript () on the boundary parameter .

4we assume that the terms which do not depend on  contribute equally to s(n)(0 , ) and

s(n)(0 , +).

5we denote the ghoshal-zamolodchikov [6],[7] boundary parameter  by x, in order to distinguish it from
our boundary parameter . we recall that ghoshal-zamolodchikov identify as xed boundary conditions
their case k = 0. moreover, in the attractive case, their bulk coupling constant  = 8
 2  1 is related to our
 by  =   1; and their rapidity variable  is related to our variable 0 by  = 0
coupling constant  = 
1 .

12

we remark that the appearance of the bulk s matrix in our expression for the boundary
s matrix can be readily understood from the fact that an n-breather can be regarded as
a bound state of n 1-breathers, which scatter among themselves upon reection from the
boundary. this is illustrated in figure 1 for the case n = 2. a single line represents a
1-breather, and so the 2-breather is represented by a double line.

figure 1: scattering of a 2-breather from the boundary.

3.3 soliton boundary s matrix

although the main focus of this paper is on breather s matrices, we compute here the
soliton boundary s matrix in order to further check the identication (3.24) of the boundary
parameters.

3.3.1 attractive case ( = 1)

we consider rst the attractive case  = 1, with  in the range (3.5), and so the ground
state is a sea of negative-parity 1-strings. following [9],[10], we consider the bethe ansatz
state consisting of one hole with rapidity  in the sea, which has sz = + 1

function is

sult of ghoshal-zamolodchikov [6] for the boundary sine-gordon model with xed bound-
ary conditions, provided the identication of boundary parameters (3.24) is again made.
fendley-saleur [8] nd a similar identication.

3.3.2 repulsive case ( = +1)

we consider nally the repulsive case  = +1, where there are no breathers. here the ground
state corresponds to a sea of positive parity 1-strings, i.e., real solutions of the bethe ansatz
equations. for the bethe ansatz state with one hole of rapidity  in the sea, the counting
function is

4 discussion

we have formulated a systematic bethe-ansatz approach for computing breather s matrices
for integrable quantum spin chains. we have used this approach to calculate the breather

boundary s matrix for the open xxz spin chain with diagonal boundary elds. we have
also directly computed the soliton boundary s matrix in the critical regime.

let us briey compare our approach with that of other authors. our approach is essen-
tially a systematization of korepins [2] analysis of the massive thirring model. key elements
of our approach are the exploitation of the second set of bethe ansatz eqs. (2.25) which
describes the centers of the breather strings; and the use of the identity (2.41). an analogous
identity for holes was used by andrei and destri [3] to compute soliton s matrices. fendley
and saleur [8] study boundary s matrices of the xxz chain using an alternative approach
based on the models physical bethe ansatz equations [11]. the identication of boundary
s matrices from the physical bethe ansatz eqs.
is not straightforward, especially in the
repulsive case. finally, we remark that the vertex-operator approach [18] has so far been
restricted in applicability to the noncritical regime.

while we have focused on the xxz chain for simplicity, we expect that the same methods

should be applicable to other models. indeed, boundary s matrices for the critical a(1)
open spin chain with diagonal boundary elds can be computed in this way [19].

a dependence on 

following many authors (see, e.g., [8],[11],[13], ), we treat the full critical regime of the xxz
chain by restricting the anisotropy parameter  to the range (0 , 
2 ), and introducing a new
parameter  = 1. we describe here this approach in detail, since there are some subtleties
associated with it, such as the dependence on  in the expression (2.4) for the momentum
and in the boundary parameters.

the restriction (b.8) leads again to the condition (b.7).

in conclusion, the bethe ansatz eqs. have the boundary 1-string solutions  = i(cid:16)  1

when  satises the condition (b.7). boundary strings of longer length are also studied in
[16].
