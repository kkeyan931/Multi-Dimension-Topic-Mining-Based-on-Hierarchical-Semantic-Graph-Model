the approach which relates thermal green functions to forward scattering amplitudes of on-
shell thermal particles is applied to the calculation of the gluon self-energy, in a class of temporal
gauges. we show to all orders that, unlike the case of covariant gauges, the exact self-energy of the
gluon is transverse at nite temperature. the leading t 2 and the sub-leading ln(t ) contributions
are obtained for temperatures t high compared with the external momentum. the logarithmic
contributions have the same structure as the ultraviolet pole terms which occur at zero temperature.

i. introduction

thermal gauge eld theories in the temporal gauge has been the subject of many investigations both in the imaginary
and in the real time formalisms [16]. one of the main advantages of the non-covariant temporal gauge is that it
is physical and eectively ghost-free. at nite temperature, it may be considered a more natural choice, since the
lorentz invariance is already broken by the presence of the heat bath. it is also convenient for calculating the response
of the qcd plasma to a chromo-electric eld, since in this case only the gluon self-energy is needed (in this gauge, the
chromo-electric eld depends only linearly on the gauge eld aa
) [1,7]. despite these advantages, explicit calculations
of loop corrections to green functions are known to be more complicated than in covariant gauges. one of the
diculty is associated with the more involved tensorial structure of the propagator (see eq. (1)). the other more
fundamental problem is how to deal with the extra poles at q  n = 0 in the gluon propagator, where q is the loop
momentum and n = (n0,~0) (n2

0 > 0) is the temporal axial four-vector.

in the imaginary time formalism, the standard method of calculation of thermal green functions consists in replacing
the matsubara frequency sum by a contour integral in the complex plane [7,8]. using this approach, all green
functions, at one-loop order, can be written as the sum of the vacuum part plus the a thermal part which involves the
bose-einstein (boson loop) or fermi-dirac (fermion loop) statistical distributions.

in the case of the temporal gauge, the extra poles at q  n = 0 in the gluon propagator demand more care and make
the standard contour integral method of calculation very involved. in order to deal with this problem, leibbrandt
and staley [6] have developed a technique for performing perturbative calculations at nite temperature in the
temporal gauge (see also reference [3] for a dierent approach to this problem). employing a special version of the
mandelstam-leibbrandt prescription [9,10] combined with the -function method [11], they have obtained the complete
00(k0 = 0, ~k). their results show that the leading and sub-
1/t -expansion for the one-loop self-energy component ab
leading contributions to the self-energy can be unambiguously determined in the temporal gauge, and are in agreement
with the standard contour integral method employed in reference [1].

the temperature dependent part of green functions can be described in terms of forward scattering amplitudes
of on-shell thermal particles of the thermal medium. this idea was described in reference [12] and has been further
elaborated in the feynman gauge and shown to be very useful for determining the partition function in qcd at high
temperature [13]. more recently this result has been generalized to the case of general covariant gauges [14]. this
method has been derived using both the imaginary time formalism and the real time formalism up to two-loop order
[15,16]. there is also an interesting relation with the path integral approach [17].

one of the purposes of this work is to extend the forward scattering method to a class of temporal gauges. the
main advantage of this method is that in the high-temperature limit, it is straightforward to obtain the full tensor
structure of both the leading t 2 and the sub-leading logarithmic contributions for temperatures t such that t  k,
where k denotes the external four-momentum. for the leading t 2 part we obtain the well known gauge invariant
hard thermal loop result. the gauge dependent sub-leading logarithmic part shares with the previous calculations in
general covariant gauges [14] the interesting property of having the same structure as the ultraviolet pole contributions
which occur at zero temperature. another purpose of this work is to study the transversality property of the thermal
gluon self-energy. as is well known [2,14,18], in general covariant gauges, the exact self-energy of the gluon is not
transverse at nite temperature.

in section ii we derive, in a class of temporal gauges, the full tensor structure of the forward scattering amplitude
associated with the gluon self-energy. in section iii we show that, in contrast to the behavior in general covariant
gauges, the exact thermal self-energy of the gluon is transverse to all orders. in section iv we compute the leading

1

gauge-invariant t 2 and the sub-leading lnt contributions of the non-vanishing transverse structures. the later is
shown to be simply related to the ultraviolet pole terms which occur at zero temperature. finally, we present a brief
conclusion in section v.

ii. the forward scattering amplitude

the diagrams which contribute to the gluon self-energy are shown in the figure 1. we employ the feynman rules
for the three- and four gluon vertices given in reference [19]. in the class of temporal gauges characterized by a gauge
parameter , the gluon propagator can be written as

and ghosts. all external momenta are inwards.

before considering the more involved diagrams in figures (1a) and (1b), let us show that the nite temperature
contribution to the diagram in figure (1c) vanishes. in the imaginary time formalism this contribution is proportional
to the following integral [7]

is the bose-einstein statistical distribution and t is a momentum independent tensor which is obtained from the
explicit expression for gluon-ghost vertex (note that the gluon-ghost vertex is not equal to zero in the class of gauges
considered here). using the partial fraction decomposition (for n  k dierent from zero)

(4)

and making the change of variable q  q  k in the second term on the right hand side, we can see that eq. (2)
vanishes when one takes into account the property

n (q0  k0) = n (q0  2nit ) = n (q0); n = 0, 1, 2    .

(5)

this result holds independently of any explicit prescription for the poles at q0 = 0.

let us now consider the diagrams in figures (1a) and (1b). we are specically interested in those contributions
which can be expressed in terms of forward scattering amplitudes of on-shell thermal particles. following the steps
described in the appendix a, such an expression can be obtained closing the contour of the q0-integration in the right
hand side of the complex plane and considering only the poles from the propagator (1) at q0 = |~q|, |~q + ~k|  k0 and at
q0 = |~q|, respectively for the diagrams in the figures (1a) and (1b). after shifting the momentum in the contribution

where the factor 1/2 in front of the curly bracket takes into account the symmetry of the graphs in gures (1a) and
(1b). it is understood that the lorentz and color indices of the thermal particles (horizontal lines) are contracted
with the tensor given by the curly bracket of eq. (1).

the full tensor structure generated by expression (6) is rather lengthy. in order to express the result in a more

suggestive form, it is convenient to use the following tensor decomposition [18]

is a set of four independent tensors which can be constructed using two lorentz indices, the gluon four momentum
k and a vector u which describes the four velocity of the heat bath. the tensors p t,l
 are transverse with respect to
the external four-momentum k and satisfy kip t
 and p d

are non-transverse.

i 6= 0 (i = 1, 2, 3), whereas the tensors p c

i = 0 and kip l

 p  c = p d

using the orthogonality of the tensors given in eq. (8) as well as the normalization 1
2 p c

 p  l =
 1
 p  d = 1, it is straightforward to obtain the explicit expressions for l, t , c , d from eqs.
(6) and (7) (the tensor algebra was performed using the maplevr3 version of the symbolic computer package hip
[20]). the resulting expressions for c and d turn out to be equal to zero. the vanishing of the one-loop correction
to d is a general consequence of the nite temperature slavnov-taylor identities [18] while the vanishing of c is a
property which is veried by the forward scattering part of the gluon self-energy. from the transversality property of
p l

 p  t = p l

2 p t

 it follows that

iii. transversality of the exact gluon self-energy

in order to ascertain whether the transversality property of the thermal gluon self-energy holds beyond the approx-
imation of forward amplitudes with on-shell particles, it is useful to study the consequences of the becchi-rouet-stora
identities [21] on the structure of ab

 at nite temperature. to derive these, we start from the eective action:

i =z d4xd4yj a(x) gab

 (x  y)b(y) +

1

2z d4xd4yaa(x)ab

 (x  y)ab(y) +   

(10)

where the ellipsis denote ghost terms which are unimportant for our purpose [19]. j a is the source of the brs
transformation, and b is a ghost eld (although in our case the closed ghost loops do not contribute to feynman
diagrams [22], the ghost elds need not necessarily decouple from the brs identity, which involves open ghost lines).
gab
 is a quantity related to the gauge transformation of the gluon eld aa, being given to lowest order by the
covariant derivative ab  gf abcac [19]. the quadratic part ab
 is the sum of free kinetic energy, without the
gauge xing term and the self-energy:

3

the relevant brs invariance of the gluon self-energy can now be written as

(k0, ~k) = ab(kk  k2g) + ab
ab

 (k0, ~k)

z d4x

j c(x)

= 0.

(11)

(12)

dierentiating this equation with respect to ab

(y) and a(z), and setting the sources and elds equal to zero leads

in momentum space to the identity:

g,ca(k0, ~k)cb

 (k0, ~k) = 0

(13)

since, to lowest order, g,ca is proportional to k, it follows from eq. (11) that the above identity implies the relation:

kab

 = (k2g  kk )g,ab  g, cacb
 ,

(14)

where g denotes the contributions of feynman loops to g.

let us rst consider the one loop order function g,ab

(1) , which may be represented as shown in gure 2a.

using eq. (1) for gluon propagator and the fact that the gluon-ghost vertex is proportional to n, one nds that

where n is the number of colors, the space-time dimension is 4   and q0 = 2lit . one can now employ the identity

(16)

since this expression is orthogonal to (k2g  kk), it follows from eq. (14), that the exact gluon self-energy is
transverse to one-loop order.

in order to study the behavior of g,ab in higher orders, let us consider, for example, the two-loops diagram shown

in figure 2b. this yields at nite temperature a contribution given by:

which is rather typical of the contributions associated with two-loop diagrams.

comparing the relation (18) with the one-loop result given by eq. (16), one can see that both expressions have the
same q-dependence. but such contributions vanish, in consequence of the antisymmetry of (q  n)1. note that, thus
far, we have made no assumptions about the specic form of n, so that this conclusion is also true in a class of axial
gauges [22].

in the specic case of temporal gauges where q  n = q0n0,it is worth noticing that the integrals decouple, in fact,

from the sums. then, we can set,in the sense of dimensional regularisation:

furthermore, using the mandelstam-leibbrandt prescription to remove the singular terms at p0 = 0 and q0 = 0, the
sum over l also gives zero because of the antisymmetry of q0 = (2it )l.

z d3q|~q| = 0,

(19)

the above arguments, which show that g,ab

(2) are equal to zero, may be extended to higher order to
establish that g,ab must generally vanish. it then follows from eq. (14) that the exact self-energy of the gluon is
transverse at all temperatures. this important property implies that, to all orders, the structure functions c and
d should be equal to zero. (we show in the appendix b that these results are conrmed by explicit calculations to
one-loop order.) in consequence of this behavior, the non-linear relation among the structure functions [18]

(1) and g,ab

which must hold at nite temperature in any linear gauge, is manifestly satised in the class of temporal gauges.

iv. high temperature contributions

the non-vanishing structures t and l, can be expanded as a series of high-temperature terms which come from
the hard thermal loop region of large q, such that q  t >> k. (there are also other contributions, such as those
proportional to t , which originate from the region of small q [1,6].) this can be done in a straightforward way
expressing the integrands in terms of the dimensionless four-vector q  (1, ~q/|~q|) and performing the expansion in
powers of 1/|~q|. the results up to sub-leading contributions are given by

the above contributions proportional to t 2 constitute the well known gauge independent hard thermal loop result
which has been previously obtained in the feynman gauge as well as in general covariant gauges [23,14]. it also agrees
with the results obtained in the static and long-wavelength limits using the temporal gauge with  = 0 [1,6].

from the second lines in eqs. (23) and (24) one can extract the part proportional to lnt which comes from the region
2 ln(t ) +   .
in this way, inserting the logarithmic part of eqs. (23) and (24) into eq. (7), we obtain the following result for the
logarithmic contribution to the gluon self-energy in the temporal gauge

of high internal momenta. such contributions can be readily obtained noticing that r d|~q|

where we have substituted u = n/n0 and n2

comparing the above logarithmic contribution with the dimensionally regularized zero-temperature gluon self-
energy in the general axial gauge [24], we nd that the coecients of ln(t ) and of 1/ are identical up to a relative
sign.

v. conclusion

we have shown that, in a class of temporal gauges, the exact thermal self-energy of the gluon is transverse to
all orders. (except for the feynman gauge, where the transversality has been veried only to one loop order, this
property is not valid in the class of covariant gauges [18].) the forward scattering amplitude associated with the
thermal gluon self-energy has been obtained, to one-loop order, using the approximation which consists in neglecting
the contributions from the prescription poles. our explicit calculations of the t 2 and ln(t ) terms, together with
the arguments in [6], show that such corrections aect only the contributions proportional to powers of 1/t , which
become negligible at high temperature. furthermore, our approach preserves the transversality property of the exact
thermal gluon self-energy. the leading t 2 and the sub-leading ln(t ) contributions are consistently obtained from the
forward scattering amplitude of on-shell thermal particles. the relation between the dimensionally regularized zero
temperature gluon self-energy and the lnt contribution, given in eq. (25), is relevant to explain the cancellation of
the ln(k2) terms between the zero temperature and the temperature dependent parts of the gluon self-energy (such
a cancellation has also been veried by explicit calculations in covariant gauges [25]).

the expression inside the bracket is a typical contribution to the on-shell forward scattering amplitude as represented,
for example, by the rst two terms in the eq. (6).

here we show explicitly that the one-loop contributions to c and d, in the class of temporal gauges characterized

by the gauge parameter , are identical to zero. we start from the general expression

appendix b:

where the integrands ic,d(k, q) are obtained projecting the contributions from the diagrams in figs. 1a and 1b onto
the tensors p c,d
. using partial fraction decompositions, as in eq. (4), we perform shifts q  q  k in all the terms
involving (q + k)  u in the denominator, which are justied in the dimensional regularization scheme. after using also
the property coth((q0  k0)/2t ) = coth(q0/2t  in) = coth(q0/2t ) as well as the invariance of the ~q-integral under
~q  ~q  ~k, the rather involved expressions of ic,d(k, q) simplify to

it is interesting to note that the terms with denominators involving factors like q u or (q +k)u cancel after performing
shifts, so that we do not need to worry about prescription poles. hence the only poles which may contribute are the
ones at q0 = |~q| and q0 = |~q + ~k|  k0. the corresponding residues of ic,d(k, q) are

performing the shift ~q  ~q  ~k in the eqs. (b5) and (b7) one can see that the contributions from the distinct poles
in ic,d(k, q) exactly cancel each other.
