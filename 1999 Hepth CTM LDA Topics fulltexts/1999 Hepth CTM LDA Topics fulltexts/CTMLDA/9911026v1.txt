abstract

motivated by the form of the noncommutative *-product in a system of open
strings and dp-branes with constant nonzero neveu-schwarz 2-form, we dene
a deformed multiplication operation on a quasitriangular hopf algebra in terms
of its r-matrix, and comment on some of its properties. we show that the
noncommutative string theory *-product is a particular example of this multi-
plication, and comment on other possible hopf algebraic properties which may
underlie the theory.

introduction

although the subject of gauge theories in noncommutative geometry is not a
new one [1], recently it has enjoyed something of a resurgence. it reappeared
in the context of matrix models compactied on tori [2], where it was shown
that such models may be reformulated as super yang-mills (sym) theories
on noncommutative spacetimes when the neveu-schwarz (ns) 2-form bij is
constant and nonzero. this is accomplished by replacing the usual commutative
multiplication of functions on the space by a noncommutative one, denoted by
*. subsequent studies dealt with various aspects of noncommutative spaces [3]-
[13]. it has also been realised that one gets a noncommutative sym theory for
the case of a system of open strings and dp-branes in a at spacetime (with the
same condition on bij), provided that one not only changes all ordinary products
to *-products, but also deforms the gauge elds and their transformations [14].
this seems to suggest that noncommutative geometry may be an underlying
aspect of a large class of theories.

if this is so, then a mathematically consistent way of dealing with this non-
commutativity is needed, and one possibility might be to use the language of
hopf algebras (has). a ha extends the notion of an algebra by including
information about its representations (through the coproduct), and when it is
quasitriangular also gives the algebraic structure of the modules it is represented
on through its associated r-matrix, i.e. commutation relations between module
elements. perhaps the best-known cases where nontrivial quasitriangular has
play key roles are quantum groups [15, 16], which may be thought of consisting
of matrices whose entries are noncommuting.

it is the intent of this paper to show (in section 3) that the *-product
mentioned above is in fact a particular case of a more general multiplication
which may be dened in terms of the r-matrix of a particular quasitriangular
ha. this may be a clue that there is indeed a quasitriangular ha structure to
these noncommutative theories, and might serve as a tentative rst step toward
nding that structure. this could in turn lead toward a way of formulating
gauge theories on a large class of spaces, not just commutative ones. some of
the implications of such a structure are commented upon in section 4.

parts of this work are somewhat pedagogical, but this is because it is in-
tended for an audience for whom the language of has may not be too familiar;
for those with some knowledge of the subject, section 2 can be skimmed just to
determine the notation we use herein. others who may be curious about has
may nd the short review useful.

2 hopf algebras

this section is meant to be a review of both the formal aspects of what consti-
tutes a hopf algebra and the explicit example where we consider the algebra of
functions over a manifold and the partial derivatives acting on them.

2.1 formal denitions
a hopf algebra h is an associative algebra with unit 1 over a eld k which
is also equipped with a counit  : h  k, a coproduct (or comultiplication)
 : h  h  h and an antipode s : h  h; the rst two of these are dened
to be homomorphisms, the third an antihomomorphism, and all three satisfy
the relations

(  id) (f ) = (id) (f ),
(  id) (f ) = (id) (f ) = f,

m ((s  id) (f )) = m ((ids) (f )) = (f )1,

(2.1)

where f  h, id is the identity map f 7 f and m is the multiplication operation
on h (which will usually be suppressed). for future reference, the rst of (2.1)
is often called coassociativity.
for clarity, we adopt sweedlers notation [17], in which we write the coprod-
uct as (f ) = f(1)  f(2), where there is an implied summation. for exam-

ple, using this convention, the third of (2.1) may be written as s(cid:0)f(1)(cid:1) f(2) =
f(1)s(cid:0)f(2)(cid:1) = (f )1.
we can dene the dually paired ha to h, denoted h, in the following way:
as a vector space over k, h is just the dual space to h, so there is an inner
product taking hh to k, written as hx, fi for x  h and f  h. h may be
given a hopf algebra structure by dening the multiplication, unit, coproduct,
counit and antipode on h via

hxy, fi
h1, fi
h(x), f  gi
(x)
hs(x), fi

:= hx  y, (f )i ,
:= (f ),
:= hx, f gi ,
:= hx, 1i ,
:= hx, s(f )i .

(2.2)

it is straightforward to show that these operations satisfy all the ha conditions.
h may be thought of as an algebra of operators on h when we dene the

(left) action of x  h on f  h, denoted x  f , as

x  f := f(1)(cid:10)x, f(2)(cid:11) .

2

(2.3)

since it is easy to show that (xy)f = x(yf ), this is indeed an action of elements
of h on those of h, and thus gives a representation of h with h as the module.
furthermore, there is a sort of leibniz rule: x (f g) = (x(1)  f )(x(2)  g). to give
h an interpretation, notice that p0(x) := x  (x)1 and p1(x) := (x)1 are
projections on h, so h = ker  k1. note that for x  ker , x 1 = 0, so these
may be thought of as derivatives on h; elements of k1 just multiply elements of
h by elements of k. finally, if we have a concept of derivatives on h, we can
x  ker .

dene an integral on h as a linear mapr : h  k such thatr x  f = 0 for any

a quasitriangular hopf algebra is an ha h for which there is a special

invertible element r  h  h, called the r-matrix, which has the properties

(  ) (f ) = r (f ) r1,
(  id) (r) = r13r23,
(id) (r) = r13r12,

(2.4)

where  : f  g 7 g  f and the subscripts on r in the latter two above
tell in which pieces of h3 r lives, i.e.
if r = r  r (sum implied), then
r13 := r  1  r. one consequence of these properties on the r-matrix is the
fact that it must satisfy the yang-baxter equation (ybe)

r12r13r23 = r23r13r12.

(2.5)

(note that since r = 1 1 satises all the above, all has are in a sense trivially
quasitriangular.)

2.2 hopf algebra of functions and derivatives
let f be the space of functions mapping rp+1 into c. f is made into a com-
(f g)(x) := f (x)g(x) for
mutative associative algebra in the usual way, e.g.
f, g  f and x  rp+1. furthermore, f can be extended to an ha if we dene
the following on the coordinate maps xi:

(cid:0)xi(cid:1)
(cid:0)xi(cid:1)
s(cid:0)xi(cid:1)

:= xi  1 + 1  xi,
:= 0,
:= xi.

(2.6)

once we have the above (as well as the relations (1) = 1  1, (1) = 1 and
s(1) = 1, of course), we can use the fact that  and  are homomorphisms and
s is an antihomomorphism to extend them to all monomials of the coordinate
functions and (ignoring questions of completeness) thus to all of f .

3

we dene f , the dually paired ha to f , to be spanned by elements {i|i =

1, . . . , d}, where the inner product between i  f  and a monomial in f is

*i,

nyp=1(cid:0)xjp(cid:1)np+ =

nxp=1

ijp np1yq6=p

nq0,

(2.7)

as well as hi, 1i = 0. once we have this, the ha structure of f  is immediate:
the form of the coproduct on f tells us that f  is commutative, the commu-
tativity of f gives  (i) = i  1 + 1  i, and  (i) = 0 and s (i) = i.
the action of i on a monomial in f can be computed as well; it will perhaps
be no surprise to the reader that the result is

i 

nyp=1(cid:0)xjp(cid:1)np =

nxp=1

np(cid:0)xjp(cid:1)np1

ijpyq6=p(cid:0)xjq(cid:1)nq .

furthermore, for two arbitrary functions f (x) and g(x),

(2.8)

i  (f (x)g(x)) = (i  f (x)) g(x) + f (x) (i  g(x)) ,

(2.9)
so f  is indeed the space of partial derivatives on functions over rp+1. (note:
for brevitys sake, from now on we will omit the  when speaking of the action
of a partial derivative on a function of x.)

3 the *-product

motivated by the previously-mentioned literature on noncommuting strings, we
now use the formalism just presented to introduce a new *-product on the hopf
algebra h. we examine its properties, and then go on to show that the non-
commutative product in string theory is a particular case of this multiplication.

3.1 formal denition of the *-product
suppose we have two dually paired has h and h, and further suppose that
there is an r-matrix on h. we can thus dene a new operation  : hh  h
in terms of r and the usual multiplication on h via

f  g := f(1)g(1)(cid:10)r21, f(2)  g(2)(cid:11) .

(3.1)
(if h is trivially quasitriangular, then f  g = f g.) this operation is actually
associative as a consequence of the ybe. to see this explicitly, we pick f, g, h 
h, and rst compute (f  g)  h:

(f  g)  h = (cid:0)f(1)g(1)(cid:10)r21, f(2)  g(2)(cid:11)(cid:1)  h

= f(1)g(1)h(1)(cid:10)r21, f(2)g(2)  h(2)(cid:11)(cid:10)r21, f(3)  g(3)(cid:11)
= f(1)g(1)h(1)(cid:10)r32r31r54, f(2)  g(2)  h(2)  f(3)  g(3)(cid:11)
= f(1)g(1)h(1)(cid:10)r32r31r21, f(2)  g(2)  h(2)(cid:11) .

(3.2)

4

  (f   g) =  (cid:0)f g(1)(cid:1)(cid:10), g(2)(cid:11)

= f(1)g(1)(cid:10), f(2)g(2)(cid:11)(cid:10), g(3)(cid:11)
= f(1)g(1)(cid:10) ()  , f(2)  (cid:0)g(2)(cid:1)(cid:11) ,

(3.3)

in going fron the rst line to the second, we used the coassociativity of ; next,
the third of (2.2), the second of (2.4) and a relabelling of the indices so as to
stick everything into one inner product; and the last step used the rst of (2.2).
if we now calculate f  (g  h), an exactly analogous compution gives the result
above with the left argument of the inner product replaced by r21r31r32, and
by using the ybe (with the rst and third tensor spaces swapped), we nd the

the algebra constructed from (the vector space) h and the *-multiplication is

two quantities are exactly the same. hence, (f  g)  h = f  (g  h) and bh,
associative. since it turns out that 1  f = f  1 = f , bh is unital as well.
mutative, bh may not be if r21 6= r. to examine this a bit more, it can be shown
ten in terms of , the *-product becomes f  g = f g + f(1)g(1)(cid:10)21, f(2)  g(2)(cid:11).

this is in general a noncommutative multiplication: even if h itself is com-
that the dening relations for r imply that (  id) (r) = (id) (r) = 11, so
that we may dene a new quantity   ker  ker  as  := r11. when writ-
suppose we now dene      and compute   (f   g):

where in the last step we have split up f(2)g(2) to get the coproduct of . the
third of (2.4) in terms of  is (id) () = 13 + 12 + 1312; if we use
argument of the inner product, we nd

this, and then get rid of (cid:0)g(2)(cid:1) by exchanging it for a multiplication in the h

  (f   g) = f(1)g(1)(cid:10)21 + (1  )r21, f(2)  g(2)(cid:11) ,

where  := . let us now suppose that there is a kind of tracelessness con-
dition on , and  vanishes. we must stress that this is purely an assumption,
but if it does in fact hold, then we conclude that

(3.4)

f  g = f g +   (f   g) ,

(3.5)
in other words, f  g and f g dier by a total derivative, since   ker . it

follows that if there is an integralr dened over h,r f  g =r f g.

a comment on the above: the above can be easily extended to the case where
we have a n  n matrix-valued hopf algebra, i.e. h  mn (k), in which case
the *-product includes matrix multiplication as well: (f  g)i
j. note
that this is not the same as a quantum group, since h is not being thought of
as the set of functions over the group manifold. thus, when we take coproducts
et al., the matrix part is unaected.

k  gk

j = f i

also, the *-product is not unique: if r21 is replaced by r1, the new * is
still associative, and the other results also follow with suitable modications.
in the case where the ha is triangular, r21 = r1 by denition, and the two
dierent *-products coincide.

3.2 noncommutative string theory

recently [14], it has been shown that when one considers open strings and dp-
branes in a space with metric gij and constant nonvanishing neveu-schwarz
2-form bij (i, j = 0, . . . , p), the theory can be reformulated as a sym theory
on a space where the coordinates no longer commute, but instead satisfy the
deformed relation

where

xi  xj  xj  xi = iij,

ij :=  (2)2(cid:18)

1

g + 2b

b

1

g  2b(cid:19)ij

.

(3.6)

(3.7)

more generally, it is shown that if f (x) and g(x) are (matrix-valued) functions,
the noncommutative product between two functions f (x) and g(x) is

f (x)  g(x) := e

i

2 ij 
i



j f (x + )g(x + )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)==0

.

(3.8)

the action then can be expressed in sym form provided that all ordinary multi-
plications are replaced by this *-product, the closed string metric gij is replaced

by the open string metric gij := gij  (2)2(cid:0)bg1b(cid:1)ij and the gauge eld
ai is replaced by bai, which depends on both ai (and its derivatives) and ij .

if we compare (3.8) to (3.1), it suggests that a candidate for the r-matrix is

r = e i

2 ij ij ,

(3.9)

but we must make sure it satises all the appropriate relations. since f  is
commutative, and  (i) is symmetric, it is evident that the rst of (2.4) is
satised. to check the second of (2.4), note that

  ky=1

i! =x xk

1

!(k  )!

i(1) . . . i()  i(+1) . . . i(k) ,

(3.10)

where  is a permutation of (1, . . . , k). therefore,

(  id) (r) =

2kk!!(k  )!ypk

(i)k

2k(k  )!

(3.11)

where in the last step we have switched the sums over k and , and also used
the commutativity of the partial derivatives in the third tensor space to get rid
of  (picking up a k! in the process). if we now split the product in the third
space into two, one from 1 to  and the other from  + 1 to k, and let k   = r,
then we get

(  id) (r) =

2rr! (cid:16)1  ij 
(i)r

i  j (cid:17)r#

(3.12)

a very similar calculation conrms that the last of (2.4) holds as well, so (3.9) is
in fact an r-matrix, and f a quasitriangular ha (in fact, since r21 = r1, it is
triangular). the ybe is therefore satised by this r, and thus * is associative,
as proven above.

to check that this r-matrix gives us the correct commutation relation (3.6),

we simply compute xi  xj :

xi  xj = (cid:0)xi(cid:1)(1)(cid:0)xj(cid:1)(1)dr21,(cid:0)xi(cid:1)(2) (cid:0)xj(cid:1)(2)e

= xixj hr21, 1  1i + xi(cid:10)r21, 1  xj(cid:11) + xj(cid:10)r21, xi  1(cid:11)
+(cid:10)r21, xi  xj(cid:11)

= xixj +

ij .

(3.13)

therefore, by switching i and j and subtracting, we recover (3.6). (3.8) holds
almost by denition, since, from (3.1), f  g is simply the product between the
action of the rst tensor space of r21 on f and the action of the second on g.
this r also satises the tracelessness condition: if we subtract 1  1 from
r21 and multiply the two tensor product spaces together, we immediately get
, which is evidently zero due to the asymmetry (and constancy) of ij and

7

commutativity of the partial derivatives, so f  g and f g dier by a total deriva-
tive. and since the original multiplication was commutative to begin with,

r tr (f  g) =r tr (g  f ).

4 noncommutative gauge theories

we now make some comments on noncommutative gauge theories and how they
may or may not relate to has.

4.1 algebraic structure

in section 2.2, we showed that for the commutative case, there is a ha structure
to both functions and derivatives on rp+1. however, even though the noncom-

to zero. but this commutator is iij 1, so we have a contradiction. therefore,

and associative, there is no deformed derivative. we can certainly dene an
inner product between the two spaces, but due to the lack of a coproduct on

this is no real surprise. in the rst place, the requirements necessary for
a space to be a ha are very restrictive, and in general there is no reason to

mutative bf is an associative unital algebra, it is not a ha, as can be seen from
the following: as we proved, the unit in f is the unit in bf , so that if bf is a ha
and has a counitb, then the fact that this counit is a homomorphism from bf
to c meansb(1) = 1. now, consider xi  xj  xj  xi; the counit will map this
bf cannot be a ha.
expect an arbitrary algebra to also be a ha. furthermore, although bf  has a
coalgebra structure (a counit and a coproduct) due to the fact that bf is unital
bf , there is no action of bf  on it, and thus no concept of derivative. this is
the noncommutative sym eld strength, via bfij = [ibaj]  iba[i  baj] [14]; if
however, although there is no interpretation of elements of bf  as objects
with a local action on bf , it might still be possible to interpret them as nonlocal

operators. as an illustration of this, consider the case of the 2-dimensional
quantum hyperplane: the coordinates x, y generate an algebra (the functions
on the plane) modulo the commutation relation xy = qyx, and the derivatives
x, y act on a function f (x, y) (ordered so that all xs appear to the left of all
ys) as

a deformed derivative were available, it would be the more natural choice, but
this is not the case.

borne out by the fact that we must use the ordinary partial derivative to dene

xf (x, y) =

yf (x, y) =

f (q2x, y)  f (x, y)

,

(q2  1) x

f (q2x, q2y)  f (q2x, y)

(q2  1) y

,

(4.1)

8

gf =(cid:10)r, f(1)  g(1)(cid:11) f(2)g(2) (cid:10)r1, f(3)  g(3)(cid:11) .

(4.2)

where q  r [18]. note that as q  1, these become ordinary derivatives, but
otherwise they are nonlocal dierence operators. the string case could be simi-
lar, with ij playing the role of ln q. this granularisation of the spacetime might
explain the absence of small instanton singularities [19, 14] in the noncommuting
theory, by smearing out such objects over more than one point.

4.2 gauge fields and hopf algebras

the fact that the *-product can be dened in terms of an abstract ha and in-
cludes the noncommutative string theory case hints at the possibility of describ-
ing the entire theory using a quasitriangular ha, where the r-matrix depends
on ij . however, this is certainly not sucient, since we have not considered

the gauge eld bai. we have also not addressed the matter of the map ai 7 bai

which allow us to cast the action in sym form. we now address both of these
issues.

ij is inherently a ha parameter; it appears in the r-matrix and therefore
describes the ha structure of f and f . this can be seen either explicitly,
as in the relation (  )(x) = r(x)r1 on any h, or via the commutation
relations of elements of h, which may be expressed as

so, motivated by these facts, it therefore seems reasonable to conjecture that
all -dependence in the theory is in the ha structure of f and f .
if this is true, then the -dependence in the noncommuting theory must arise
from the underlying ha describing the commutative theory. this gives us a bit
of information about the gauge elds: we know that the change of variables
between the gauge elds of the two theories involves  [14], which means some
sort of ha-derived operation is involved in going from one to the other. since, as

there must be some element w  f with given ha properties (coproduct, etc.)
the ha structure and not in f (as a vector space) itself leads to the conclusion
that w is independent of , and thus must be related to ai, since this is the
gauge eld for the ij = 0 case. if we also assume that the only dependence on
the open string metric gij is from constructing lorentz-invariant quantities in

we proved in the previous section, the noncommutative algebra bf is not a ha,
which is related to both ai and bai. the assumption that all -dependence is in
the integral, e.g. r dp+1xggij ij, then w should also be g-independent.

at this writing, we do not know precisely what this element might be, but a
natural candidate would be the wilson line (which explains why we call it w ):
recall that the wilson line wc(x0,x) is given by

wc(x0,x) := peir c(x0,x) a,

(4.3)

where c (x0, x) is a path going from x0 to x. it depends on the gauge eld of
the commutative theory, and is independent of  and g, so it ts the criteria

9

our proposed w must relate both gauge elds in a ha-dependent way, but be
independent of . the relation of wc to ai is through the multiplication on f ,
for which the same wc can be written as a path-ordered exponential as well,

we just outlined. we might also be able to obtain bai in the following way:
via the path-ordered exponent. we could therefore dene bai to be that function
but this time using the *-product instead (denotedbe). in other words,
= 1 + izc(x0,x) ba zc(x0,x) ba zc(x0,x1) ba! + . . .

wc(x0,x) = pbe ir c(x0,x) ba

(4.4)

then the condition

(4.5)



ij pbe ir c(x0,x) ba = 0

would give a dierential equation involving bai, ij and wc , which we could
presumably solve to nd bai as a function of ij and (derivatives of) ai. our

rst calculations show enough similarities to the rst of equation (3.5) of [14]
to be encouraging.

as for the gauge transformation, the same idea applies: a nite transforma-
tion on wc given by a unitary matrix u (x) = ei(x) gives u (x)wc(x0,x)u 1 (x0).

this should be the same as if we started with wc in terms of * and bai, and
then transformed by u expressed in terms of * and a new matrixb via u =be ib.

then by solving

(4.6)

we would obtain the second of (3.5) in [14].



ij hbe ib(x) be ir c(x0,x) ba be ib(x0)i = 0,

so the sought-after w  f could be related to the wilson loop wc , even
though we do not claim to have oered anything more than a vague justication
for this feeling. we have not said anything about the ha properties of w

(although the ha enters in going from e to be, via *), nor have we said how

the curve c (x0, x) would be chosen, since we have taken it to be completely
arbitrary. and perhaps most importantly, we have not considered what the
action might be as a function of w (and r) such that we ultimately end up
with a sym form when we go to the noncommuting spacetime. regardless,
there is enough evidence to consider our wilson line guess as reasonable.

everything we have done above has been for the specic case of a noncommu-
tative string, where we started with a commutative space (rp+1); formulating
it in the ha language as we propose would also be a way of coming up with
gauge theories where the original space might be noncommutative. steps in this
direction have been made when the gauge group (and possibly also the space-
time) is deformed [20], and this may mean there is some hope of success for the
present problem.

10

5 conclusions

we have shown that the product appearing in noncommutative string theory is
simply a specic case of one which may be dened in terms of a quasitriangular
ha. this fact has lead us to speculate that it may be possible to relate an
arbitrary noncommutative gauge theory to a quasitriangular ha in this way,
and we have commented on some ways in which this may be done. we hope to
address this possibility in future work.
