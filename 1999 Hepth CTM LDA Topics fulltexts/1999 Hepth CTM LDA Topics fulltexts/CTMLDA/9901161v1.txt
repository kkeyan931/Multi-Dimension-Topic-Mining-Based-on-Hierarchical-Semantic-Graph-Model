abstract

we present a summary of the progress made in the last few years on topological
quantum eld theory in four dimensions. in particular, we describe the role played by
duality in the developments which led to the seiberg-witten invariants and their relation
to the donaldson invariants.
in addition, we analyze the fruitful framework that this
connection has originated. this analysis involves the study of topological quantum eld
theories which contain twisted n = 2 supersymmetric matter elds as well as theories
obtained after twisting n = 4 supersymmetry. in the latter case, we present some recent
results including the generalization of the partition function of the vafa-witten theory
for gauge group su(n) with prime n.

topological quantum eld theory (tqft) in four dimensions [1][2][3][4] has become a
very fruitful link between physics and mathematics. on the one hand, the progress made
in the last years on the duality properties of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theories
has been applied to their topological counterparts to dene new invariants, the seiberg-
witten invariants [5], and to show their relation with known invariants as the donaldson
invariants [6]. on the other hand the topological nature of twisted n = 4 supersymmetric
theories has provided important tests of our ideas on duality symmetry. both sides benet
from each other and certainly they will continue to do so in the forthcoming years after
the consequences of the recent ads/cft conjecture [7][8][9] in this context start being
explored  see [10][11] for some proposals in this direction.

edward witten inaugurated the eld of topological quantum eld theory in the begin-
ning of 1988 with his work on donaldson theory from a quantum eld theory perspective
[1]. he formulated a twisted version of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory, now known
as donaldson-witten theory, whose observables were identied with the donaldson in-
variants of four-manifolds [6]. his formulation was later reinterpreted [12] from a more
geometrical point of view, in terms of a representative of the thom class of a vector bundle
associated to certain moduli problem in the framework of the mathai-quillen formalism
[13]. twisted n = 2 supersymmetric theories, in general, are associated to certain moduli
problems which, properly treated in the context of the mathai-quillen formalism, lead to
representatives of the thom class which become the exponential of the twisted actions
on the eld theory side. both pictures of donaldson-witten theory have been known for
some time. one important property of the resulting tqft is that the vacuum expec-
tation values of its observables are independent of the coupling constant. this means
that these quantities could be computed in either the strong or the weak coupling limit.
the weak coupling limit analysis showed the relation of the observables of the theory
to the donaldson invariants. however, in such analysis no new progress was made from
the quantum eld theory representation regarding the calculation of these invariants. the
dicult problems that one had to face were similar to those in ordinary donaldson theory.
the strong-coupling eective theory of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory was
obtained by seiberg and witten in 1994 [5]. one would expect that the twisted version
of this eective theory would be related to the donaldson-witten theory. furthermore,
since the observables of a tqft are independent of the coupling constant, the weak
coupling limit of the eective theory should be exact, i.e., it would lead to donaldson
invariants. this is in fact what turns out to be the case. the twisted eective theory
could be regarded as a tqft dual to the original one. in addition, one could ask for
the dual moduli problem associated to this dual tqft. it turns out that in some of the
most interesting situations (b+
2 > 1) this moduli space is an abelian version of the moduli
space of instantons modied by the presence of chiral spinors. this space is known as
the moduli space of abelian monopoles [14]. being related to an abelian gauge theory
this space is simpler to analyze than the moduli space of instantons. furthermore, for
a large set of four-manifolds (of simple type), only particular classes of abelian gauge
congurations (basic classes) contribute. for these classes the moduli space of abelian
monopoles reduces to a nite set of points.

donaldson-witten theory has been generalized after studying its coupling to topolog-
ical matter elds [15][16][17]. the resulting theory can be regarded as a twisted form

1

of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory coupled to hypermultiplets, or, in the con-
text of the mathai-quillen formalism, as the tqft associated to the moduli space of
non-abelian monopoles [18][19]. perturbative and non-perturbative methods have been
applied to this theory for the case of gauge group su(2) and one hypermultiplet of mat-
ter in the fundamental representation [20]. in this case, again, it turns out that when
b+
2 > 1 the generalized donaldson invariants can be written in terms of seiberg-witten
invariants.

recently, a general framework to analyze models with gauge group su(2), known
as integration over the u-plane [21][22][23], has been constructed. from this new view-
point, the presence of seiberg-witten invariants turns out to be rather general. they are
believed to provide the only contributions to the invariants for manifolds with b+
2 > 1.
generalizations to higher-rank gauge groups have been also studied [24]. in all these ex-
amples one nds relations among dierent moduli spaces. in the context of tqft in four
dimensions, duality relates moduli spaces: observables which are topological invariants
of a given four-manifold can be computed using information from two dierent moduli
spaces. the duality properties of the physical theory x the type of moduli spaces which
are involved in each case.

not all the theories obtained after twisting extended supersymmetric theories fall into
the duality pattern among moduli spaces described above. that is the case for some of
the twistings which originate from n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory, in particular
for the twisting considered in [25] by vafa and witten. from the duality point of view
discussed in this paper this theory can be regarded as a self-dual theory in the sense
that it involves only one moduli space. in this case duality manifests itself in a dierent
form:
it becomes an sl(2, zz) symmetry which involves the coupling constant and the
dual gauge groups [25].

to begin with the description of donaldson-witten theory we rst review some gener-
alities concerning n = 2 supersymmetry in four-dimensions. the global symmetry group
of n = 2 supersymmetry in ir4 is h = su(2)l  su(2)r  su(2)i  u(1)r where
k = su(2)l  su(2)r is the rotation group and su(2)i  u(1)r is the internal (chiral)
symmetry group. the supercharges, qi
 and qi , which generate n = 2 supersymmetry,
have the following transformations under h:

where the superindex denotes the u(1)r charge and the numbers within parentheses
label the representations under each of the factors in su(2)l  su(2)r  su(2)i. the
supercharges (1) satisfy:

l is the diagonal subgroup of su(2)l  su(2)i. this implies that

it is important to stress that as long as we stay on a at space (or one with trivial
holonomy), the twist is just a fancy way of considering the theory, for in the end we are not
changing anything. however, the appearance of a scalar symmetry makes the procedure
meaningful when we move to an arbitrary four-manifold. once the scalar symmetry is
found we must study if it can be written as the transformation of some quantity under q.
if this is the case, the vacuum expectation value of q-invariant operators will be metric
independent. the n = 2 supersymmetry algebra gives a necessary condition for this to
hold. indeed, after the twisting, this algebra becomes:

{qi

, qj } = i

jp   {q, g } = p ,

(4)

where p  is the momentum operator of the theory. certainly (4) is only a necessary
condition for the theory to be topological. however, up to date, for all the supersymmetric
models whose twisting has been studied the relation on the right hand side of (4) has
become valid for the whole energy-momentum tensor.

in ir4 the original and the twisted theories are equivalent. however, for arbitrary
manifolds x they are certainly dierent due to the fact that their energy-momentum
tensors are not the same. the twisting changes the spin of the elds in the theory, and
therefore their couplings to the metric on x become modied. this suggests an alternative
way of looking at the twist. all that has to be done is: gauge the internal group su(2)i,
and identify the corresponding su(2) connection with the spin connection on x. this
process changes the spin connection and therefore the energy-momentum tensor of the
theory, which in turn modies the couplings to gravity of the dierent elds of the theory.
this alternative point of view to the twisting procedure has been reviewed in this context
in [26].

as mentioned above, the donaldson-witten theory can be constructed by twisting
the pure n =2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with gauge group su(2). this theory
contains a gauge eld a, a pair of chiral spinors i and a complex scalar eld b. under
the twist, this eld content is modied as follows:

in the process of twisting, the u(1)r symmetry becomes the u(1)-like symmetry associ-
ated to the ghost number of the topological theory. the ghost number anomaly is thus
naturally related to the chiral anomaly of u(1)r. the twisted action has the form:

it is invariant under the transformations generated by q which from now on will be
denoted as -transformations:

a = ,
 = da,
 = 0,

 = g,

 = i[, ],
 = .

(7)

in these transformations, 2 is a gauge transformation with gauge parameter . observ-
ables are therefore related to the g-equivariant cohomology of  (that is, the cohomology
of  restricted to gauge invariant operators). of course, auxiliary elds can be introduced
so that the action (6) is -exact [4].

to construct the observables of the theory we begin by pointing out that for each inde-
pendent casimir of the gauge group g it is possible to construct a highest-ghost-number
operator w0, from which lower ghost-number operators wi can be dened recursively
through the descent equations wi = dwi1. for example, for the quadratic casimir this
operator is:

w0 =

1
82 tr (2),

(8)

(11)

and it generates the following family of operators:

w1 =

1
42 tr (),

w2 =

1

42 tr (cid:18)1

2

   +   f(cid:19) ,

w3 =

1
42 tr (f ). (9)

from them one denes the following observables:

o(k) =zk

wk,

(10)

where k  hk(x). the descent equations imply that they are -invariant and that they
only depend on the homology class of k. according to (5), the ghost numbers of these
operators are u(o(k)) = 4  k.
the form:

the functional integral corresponding to the topological invariants of the theory has

do(k1)o(k2)   o(kp)e =z o(k1)o(k2)   o(kp) exp(s/g2),

where the integration has to be understood on the space of eld congurations modulo
gauge transformations, and g is a coupling constant. standard arguments show that due
to the -exactness of the action s, the quantities obtained in (11) are independent of g.
this implies that the observables of the theory can be obtained either in the limit g  0,
where perturbative methods apply, or in the limit g  , where one is forced to consider
a non-perturbative approach.
let us consider rst the theory in the weak coupling limit g  0. the previous argu-
ment arms that the semiclassical approximation is exact. in the weak coupling limit the
contributions to the functional integral are dominated by the bosonic eld congurations
which minimize s. these turn out to be given by the equations:

f + = 0,

dd = 0.

(12)

4

let us assume that in the situation under consideration there are only irreducible con-
nections (this is true in the case b+
2 = dim h 2,+(x) > 1). in this case the contributions
from the bosonic part of the action are given entirely by the solutions of the equation
f + = 0, i.e., by instanton congurations. since the connection is irreducible, there are
no non-trivial solutions to the second equation in (12).

the zero modes of the eld  come from the solutions to the equations

(d)+ = 0,

d = 0,

(13)

which dene precisely the tangent space to the space of instanton congurations. the
number of independent solutions of these equations determine the dimension of the in-
stanton moduli space masd. for su(2) this dimension is dmasd = 8k3(+)/2, where
k is the instanton number, while  and  are the euler characteristic and the signature
of the manifold x, respectively.

the fundamental contribution to the functional integral (11) is given by the elements
of masd and by the zero-modes of the solutions to (13). once these have been obtained
they must be introduced in the action and an expansion up to quadratic terms in non-zero
modes must be performed. the elds  and  are integrated out originating a contribution
[1] which is equivalent to the replacement of the eld  in the operators o(k) by

a z d4yg gab(x, y)[(y), (y)]b,

where gab(x, y) is the inverse of the laplace operator,

ddgab(x, y) = ab(4)(x  y).

these are the only relevant terms in the limit g  0. the resulting gaussian integrations
then must be performed. due to the presence of the  symmetry these come in quotients
whose value is 1. the functional integral (11) takes the form:

do(k1)o(k2)   o(kp)e =
zmasd
da1    dadmasd

d1    ddmasdo(k1)o(k2)   o(kp)(1)(a1,...,admasd

), (16)

) = 0, 1. the integration over the odd modes leads to a selection
where (a1, . . . , admasd
rule for the product of observables. this selection rule is better expressed making use of
the ghost numbers of the elds. for the operators in (10) the selection rule can be written

in the case in which dmasd = 0, the only observable is the partition function, which

(14)

(15)

(17)

as dmasd =pp

i=1 u(o(ki)) =pp

takes the form:

i=1(4  ki).
h1i =xi

(1)i,

where the sum is over isolated instantons, and i = 0, 1. in general, the integration over
the zero-modes in (16) leads to an antisymmetrization in such a way that one ends up
with the integration of a dmasd-form on masd. the resulting real number is a topological
invariant of the four-manifold x. notice that in the process a map

hk(x)  h k(masd),

5

(18)

has been constructed. hence, the correlation functions of the topological theory give
polynomials in hk1(masd)  hk2(masd)      hkp(masd), which are precisely the
donaldson polynomial invariants of x.
the vacuum expectation values (16) can be collected in a very convenient way by
introducing a generating function. let us assume that we consider only smooth, compact,
oriented four-manifolds which are simply connected. in this case only w0 in (8) and w2
in (9) are relevant operators. given a basis {a}a=1,...,b2(x) of h2(x), we dene, following
[14][21][27], the generating function

ai(a)+oe ,
where o = w0 as in (8), and i(a) = ra w2 as in (10).

in (19) the quantities a,
a = 1, . . . , b2(x) and  are constant parameters. the expectation values (16) can be
easily extracted from the power expansion of (19).

f (, 1, 2, . . .) =depa

(19)

in the weak coupling limit one nds for the function f (, 1, 2, . . .) in (19) an expres-
sion similar to (16). this expression does lead to the computation diculties inherent in
the donaldson theory. in the weak coupling limit one proves that the donaldson theory
has a quantum eld theory interpretation but this interpretation does not provide new
insights to compute the donaldson invariants. nevertheless, the eld theory connection
is very important since in this theory the strong and weak coupling limits are exact, and
therefore the door is open to nd a strong coupling description which could lead to a
new, simpler representation for the donaldson invariants. the strong coupling realiza-
tion of the donaldson-witten theory was found by witten [14] after using the results
on the strong coupling behavior of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories which he and
n. seiberg [5] had discovered. the key ingredient used by witten was to assume that
the strong coupling limit of donaldson-witten theory is equivalent to the sum over
the twisted eective low energy descriptions of the corresponding n = 2 physical theory.
this sum is not entirely a sum, as in general it has a part which contains a continuous
integral. the sum is now known as integration over the u-plane after the work by moore
and witten [21]. the reasons for this will become clear below. wittens assumption in
[14] can be simply stated as saying that the weak-strong coupling limit and the twist
commute. in other words, to study the strong coupling limit of the topological theory,
rst one untwists, then one works out the strong coupling limit of the physical theory
and, nally, one twists back.

in order to implement the duality picture among moduli spaces we need to know
two important pieces of information: the low energy description of n = 2 extended
supersymmetric yang-mills theories and the map of the topological observables (10) into
their strong coupling counterparts. the rst of these issues was addressed by seiberg
and witten in 1994 [5] and its basic structure is by now well-known in rather general
situations. the second was discussed in several works [14][20][27] but only recently it has
been systematized using the canonical solution to the descent equations used for the rst
time, though in a dierent tqft, in [28].

from the work by seiberg and witten [5] follows that at low energies n = 2 super-
symmetric yang-mills theories behave as abelian gauge theories. for the case of gauge
group su(2), which will be the case considered in this discussion, the eective low energy
theory is parametrized by a complex variable u which labels the vacuum structure of the

6

theory. at each value of u the eective theory is an n = 2 supersymmetric abelian gauge
theory coupled to n = 2 supersymmetric matter elds. one of the most salient features
of the low-energy description is that there are points in the complex u-plane where some
matter elds become massless. these points are singular points of the eective theory
and they are located at u = 1. at u = 1 the eective theory consists of an n = 2
supersymmetric abelian gauge theory coupled to a massless monopole, while at u = 1
it is coupled to a dyon. the eective theories at each singular point are related by a
chiral zz2 symmetry which exists on the u-plane. this symmetry relates the behavior of
the theory around one singularity to its behavior around the other.

one of the most important features of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory is that
its lagrangian can be written in terms of a single holomorphic function, the prepotential
f . this prepotential is holomorphic in the sense that it depends only on an n = 2 chiral
supereld  which denes the theory, and not on its complex conjugate. the microscopic
theory is dened by a classical quadratic prepotential:

fcl() =

1
2

cl2,

cl =

bare
2

+

4i
g2
bare

.

(20)

in terms of this prepotential the lagrangian is given by the following expression in n = 1
superspace:

l =

1
4

imtr"z d4

f (a)
a

a +z d2

1
2

a2 w w# ,
2f (a)

where a is a chiral n = 1 supereld containing the elds (, ), and w is a constrained
chiral spinor supereld containing the non-abelian gauge eld and its n = 1 superpartner
(a, ). all the elds take values in the adjoint representation of the gauge group, which
we take to be su(2). the potential term for the complex scalar  is:

(21)

(22)

v () = tr(cid:16)[, ]2(cid:17) .

the minimum of this potential is attained at eld congurations of the form  = 1
2a3,
which dene the classical moduli space of vacua. a convenient gauge invariant parametriza-
tion of the vacua is given by u = tr2, which equals 1
2a2 semiclassically. for u 6= 0, su(2)
is spontaneously broken to u(1). the spectrum of the theory splits up into two massive
n = 2 vector multiplets, which accommodate the massive w  bosons together with their
superpartners, and an n = 2 abelian multiplet which accommodates the n = 2 pho-
ton together with its superpartners. for u = 0, the full su(2) symmetry is (classically)
restored.

to study the quantum vacua seiberg and witten analyzed the structure of the low
energy theory, whose eective lagrangian up to two derivatives is given, after integrating
out the massive modes, by an expression like (21) but with a new eective prepotential
depending only on an abelian multiplet. the result of their analysis has some important
features. first of all, it turns out that at the quantum level the su(2) symmetry is
never restored, i.e., the theory stays in the coulomb phase throughout the u-plane. the
moduli space of vacua (u-plane) is a complex one-dimensional kahler manifold in which
the prepotential f has singularities at the points u = 1. these singularities correspond
to the presence of a massless monopole (at u = 1) and a massless dyon (at u = 1). near

7

each of the singularities, the complete non-singular eective action should include together
with the n = 2 abelian vector multiplet, a massless monopole or a dyon hypermultiplet.
as we did in the perturbative approach, we will consider the theory on manifolds
x with b+
2 > 1. in the limit g  0 one has to take into account the classical moduli
space. since for b+
2 > 1 there are not abelian instantons the only contribution comes
from u = 0 and one has to go through the analysis carried out in our discussion of
the perturbative approach. as described there, one is led to the standard approach to
donaldson invariants via integration over the moduli space of non-abelian instantons. on
the other hand, in the limit g  , since the supersymmetric theory is asymptotically
free, we are in the infrared regime, and the contributions come from the quantum moduli
space. in the case under consideration (b+
2 > 1) there are no abelian instantons. since
the abelian gauge eld is the only massless eld away from the singularities, the only
contributions come from the singular points, u = 1, where there are additional massless
elds. near each of these points, n = 2 supersymmetry dictates the form of the weakly
coupled eective theory. since the observables of the twisted theory are independent of
the coupling constant, one expects that donaldson invariants can be expressed in terms
of vevs of some operators in the twisted eective theories around each singular point.

the theory around the monopole singularity is an n = 2 supersymmetric abelian
gauge theory coupled to a massless hypermultiplet. this theory has a twisted version
which has been constructed in [15][16] from the point of view of twisting n = 2 super-
symmetry, and in [18] using the mathai-quillen formalism. it has been addressed in other
works [17][29]. the structure of this theory is similar to that of the donaldson-witten
theory. the resulting action is -exact and therefore one can study the theory in the weak
coupling limit, which, as the theory is abelian, corresponds to the low energy limit.

let us describe the structure of the twisted n = 2 supersymmetric abelian gauge
theory coupled to a twisted hypermultiplet. we will assume that the four-dimensional
manifold x is a spin manifold. the analysis naturally extends to the case of manifolds
which are not spin as shown in [14]. a hypermultiplet is built out of two chiral n = 1
superelds, q and q,

q(q1, q),
q(q
2, q),

1, q ),
q(q
q(q2, q ).

(24)

the twisted elds m, , and   belong, respectively, to (s+  l) and (s  l),
where s are the positive/negative chirality spin bundles and l is a complex line bundle.
the action of the twisted abelian eective theory can be found in [4][18]. in the weak-
coupling limit, the main contribution to the functional integral comes from a bosonic
conguration given by the solutions to the equations:

f +

 +

i
2

m (m) = 0, d m  = 0.

(25)

these equations are known as monopole equations [14]. the tangent space to the moduli
space, mam, dened by these equations is given by the linearization of (25), which happen
to be the eld equations:

i
2

(m () + (m)) = 0,

 +

(d)+
d  + i m  = 0.

(26)

the dimension of the moduli space can be calculated from (26) by means of an index
theorem, and turns out to be [14],

dmam = (c1(l))2 

2 + 3

4

.

(27)

the only contributions to the partition function come from dmam = 0 (isolated monopoles).
introducing the shorthand notation, x = 2c1(l), we have:
dmam = 0  x2 = 2 + 3.

(28)

as in the donaldson-witten theory, the integration over the quantum uctuations around
the background (25) gives an alternating sum over the dierent monopole solutions for a
given class x:

nx =xi

i,x,

i,x = 1.

(29)

the nx are the partition functions of the twisted abelian theory for a xed class x (com-
pare to (17)). those classes such that (28) holds and nx 6= 0 are called basic classes. the
quantities nx turn out to constitute a new set of topological invariants for four-manifolds
known as seiberg-witten invariants. other observables dierent than the nx could be
studied in the theory of abelian monopoles. we have restricted our attention only to
the partition function of this theory because it turns out that the seiberg-witten invari-
ants, nx, are the fundamental quantities that enter in the computation of the generating
function (19) for the case of manifolds of simple type.

to compute the partition function of the full theory we must sum over classes and
take into account the contribution from each of the singularities on the u-plane. instead
of computing the partition function we will concentrate our attention on the more general
generating function (19). in computing this we must address the question of what is the

9

form of the observables of donaldson-witten theory in terms of operators of the eective
abelian theory. to answer this question we will use the expansion of the observables in the
untwisted, physical theory, together with the canonical solution to the descent equations
in the topological abelian theory. we follow the argument presented in [4][21]. near the
monopole singularity, the u variable has the expansion [5]:

dad!0
u(ad) = 1 +  du

ad + higher order,

(30)

where (du/dad)0 = 2i, while higher order stands for operators of higher dimensions in
the expansion. the eld ad corresponds to the eld d of the topological abelian theory
[18], while the gauge-invariant parameter u corresponds to the observable (8). therefore,
the map among operators between the microscopic and the macroscopic descriptions must
be such that o becomes u up to a factor:

o  hoiu,

(31)

where hoi is a constant parameter. once the operator o has been identied one can use
the canonical solution to the descent equations of the macroscopic description to obtain
the operator which must correspond to i() in (19). actually we will concentrate on
i(v) = pa ai(a) and we will think of v as the formal sum v =pa aa. the starting

point is the operator u and the procedure is described in [21]. one nds:

i(v)  

2zv  1
ihv i

32

d2u
da2
d

   

2
4

(fd + g+)! ,

du
dad

(32)

where fd is the anti-self-dual part of the abelian eld strength fd and  and g are
the abelian versions of the anticommuting vector and the auxiliary eld, respectively, in
(5). as in the case of (31), the quantity hv i is a constant parameter. both hoi and hv i
can be reabsorbed by a rescaling of the parameters a and  in (19). they will be xed
later comparing the prediction from the tqft to known mathematical results for a given
manifold assuming that the parameters a and  in (19) can be identied with the ones
used in the referred mathematical results.

once the mapping has been established, one must study the vacuum expectation value
(19) in the eective abelian theory near the singularity at u = 1. for this theory the
operator associated to o in (31) becomes a c-number (u = 1) and we can make the
replacement:
(33)

o  hoi.

the contribution from the operator associated to i(v) is more subtle. first of all, for
simply connected manifolds one can ignore the 2 terms. in the part containing fd in
(32) one can replace fd by fd since the dierence is q-exact. the integration of the
term containing an auxiliary eld g+ can be easily done and it turns out that exp(i(v))
is then mapped to [21]:

exp(i(v))  exp  

4 zv(cid:16) du
ihv i

dad

fd(cid:17) + hv i2 (du/dad)2

8im

v+  v+!,

(34)

10

where v+  v+ denotes the intersection pairing on h2(x).
the term v+ v+ in (34) is a rst sign of the presence of a contact term in the operator
associated to exp(i(v)) in the macroscopic description. on general grounds one expects
that if a i(v) is mapped to i(v), the product i(1) i(2)   i(n) is not mapped to the
product i(1) i(2)   i(n). rather, one would expect contributions at the intersections
of the surfaces a. thus, it is natural to expect a term containing vv = v2 in the operator
associated to exp(i(v)). the explicit form of this term has been worked out in [21] using
arguments based on the modular invariance of the low energy description. it turns out
that the correct mapping is:

exp(i(v))  exp  

dad

fd(cid:17) + hv i2v2t (u)!,
4 zv(cid:16) du
ihv i
24 e2( )  du
dad!2
 8u!,

where

t (u) = 

1

(35)

(36)

with e2( ) the eisenstein series of weight 2. in the limit u  1, one nds du/da = 2i,
t (1) = 1/2, and, therefore, the operator exp(i(v)) becomes the c-number:

2

(37)

v2!,
exp(i(v))  exp hv i x  v + hv i2
where x = c1(l2) = fd/2 is the class which entered (29).
we are now in a position to evaluate the correlation function (19) at the monopole
singularity. to do this we must take into account (31) and (35), integrate over the space
of monopole solutions mam, and then take the limit ad  0. the factors (31) and (35)
can be accompanied by some other terms that could be present due to the fact that the
form of the twisted theory is not unique. terms involving the fd  fd or the euler
characteristic  and the signature  of the manifold x could be added to the lagrangian.
the most general form of the possible terms present has been analyzed in [21]. their
concrete form can be computed using the wall crossing techniques described there. these
terms are now known and one possesses an explicit expression for the vacuum expectation
value (19) which involves the integration over the moduli spaces of monopole solutions
and the consideration of the limit ad  0. the solution notably simplies if one assumes
that the only contributions are the ones corresponding to dmam = 0. manifolds which
satisfy this condition are called of simple type. in this situation the calculation simplies
because then one must consider the limit ad  0 of the operators (31) and (35) which
just corresponds to (33) and (37). the integration over the zero-dimensional moduli
space leads to the seiberg witten invariants (29), and the global coecient can be easily
obtained considering the limit ad  0 of the extra terms xed imposing wall crossing
conditions.
after summing over classes x, the contribution from the point corresponding to the

monopole singularity becomes:

c1exp hv i2

2

v2 + hoi!xx

nxehv ivx,

(38)

where c1 is a constant which turns out to be:
c1 = 21+ 7

4 + 11
4 .

(39)

next, we must work out the contribution from the dyon singularity at u = 1. this
contribution is related to the one from u = 1 by a zz2 transformation, which is the
anomaly-free symmetry on the u-plane which remains after the breaking of the chiral
symmetry u(1)r. let us begin by recalling the transformations of the elds entering the
observables under the u(1)r-transformations:

1
  ei1

  ei2
2

b  e2ib.

instanton eects break this symmetry down to zz8 (4nc  2nf in the general case of
su(nc) gauge group with nf hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation). under
this anomaly-free zz8,

and therefore,

b  e2i( 2

8 )b = e i

2 b,

u = tr(b2)  eiu = u,

(40)

(41)

which gives a zz2 symmetry on the u-plane. this zz2 symmetry relates the contributions
to the vevs from u = 1 to those from u = 1. under the zz8 symmetry, the observables
transform as follows:

i(a) =

1

42 za

hence, using (38) one nds:

u = 1,

u = 1,

(42)

(43)

the quantities c2 and c1 are related because on a curved background the zz8 transfor-
mation, while being preserved by gauge instantons, picks anomalous contributions from
the measure due to gravitational anomalies. the contribution is of the form exp i
2 ,
where  = +

finally, we take both contributions and sum over basic classes. the nal form of the

generating function (19) turns out to be:

f (, 1, 2, . . .) = c1"e(cid:16) hv i2

2 v2+hoi(cid:17)xx

nxehv ivx + ie(cid:16) hv i2

2 v2hoi(cid:17)xx

(46)

by comparing to known results by kronheimer and mrowka [30] the constants hoi and
hv i in (46) are xed to be:
(47)

hoi = 2,

hv i = 1.

these quantities are universal, i.e., entirely independent of the manifold x. this turns
out to be the case according to the values (47), a very important test of construction.
dierent aspects of seiberg-witten solution are reected in (46). the fact that this
formula ts all known mathematical results for simply-connected manifolds with b+
2 > 1
is rather satisfactory from the physical point of view.

we are now in a position to write down the nal expression for the generating function

of the donaldson invariants:

so far we have discussed two dierent moduli problems in four-dimensional topology,
one dened by the asd instanton equations and another one dened by the seiberg-
witten monopole equations. there is a natural generalization of these moduli problems
which involves a non-abelian gauge group and also includes spinor elds. it is the moduli
problem dened by the non-abelian monopole equations, introduced in ref. [19] in the
context of the mathai-quillen formalism and as a generalization of donaldson theory.
it has been also considered in ref.
[17][31], as well as in the mathematical literature
[32][33][34][35].

in order to introduce these equations in the case of g = su(n) and the monopole elds
in the fundamental representation n of g, let us consider a riemannian four-manifold
x together with a principal su(n)-bundle p and a vector bundle e associated to p
through the fundamental representation. suppose for simplicity that the manifold is spin,
and consider a section m i
 of s+  e. the non-abelian monopole equations read in this
case:

f +ij

(m i
e m)i = 0.

(d 

)

(m k

)(cid:17) = 0,

(50)

13

starting from these equations it is possible to build the associated tqft within the
mathai-quillen formalism. not surprisingly, the resulting theory is the non-abelian ver-
sion of the topological theory of abelian monopoles, that is, a twisted version of n = 2
super yang-mills coupled to one massless hypermultiplet. the eld content is just the
non-abelian version of that of the abelian monopole theory. the model can be extended
by considering more than one hypermultiplet (nf > 1), as proposed in [21]. let us briey
describe in this note the case nf = 1. we will follow the presentation in [4][19][20]. for
a review, see [36].

from the monopole equations (50) follows that the appropriate geometric setting is
the following. the eld space is a(x, s+e), which is the space of gauge connections
on p and positive chirality spinors in the representation n of g. the vector bundle has
as ber, f = 2,+(x, adp )  (x, s+  e), as dictated by the quantum numbers of
the monopole equations. the dimension of the moduli space of non-abelian monopoles,
mna, is provided by a suitable index theorem [19]. it takes the form:

dim mna = dim masd + 2 index de
n 2  1

= (4n  2)c2(e) 

( + ) 

2

n

.

(51)

notice that masd  mna. in addition to this, the usual conditions to have a well-dened
moduli problem (like the reducibility) are essentially the same as in donaldson theory.
the observables of the theory are the same as in the donaldson-witten theory since no
non-trivial observables involving matter elds have been found. the topological invariants
are then given by correlation functions of the form (11). in the perturbative regime, g  0,
one nds the same pattern as in ordinary donaldson-witten theory. there is a map like
in (18), hk(x)  h k(mna), which implies that the vevs of the theory give a new
set of polynomials in hk1(mna)  hk2(mna)  . . .  hkp(mna). as in the case of the
donaldson-witten theory, the perturbative approach does not provide any further insight
into the precise form of these topological invariants. fortunately, it is again possible to
apply the results of seiberg and witten on n = 2 supersymmetric theories to analyze
the model at hand in the non-perturbative regime.
to carry out the analysis at strong coupling one can follow the same strategy as
in the case of donaldson-witten theory. the physical theory underlying the theory of
non-abelian monopoles is an n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory coupled to one
massless hypermultiplet in the fundamental representation of the gauge group, which we
take to be su(2). this theory is asymptotically free. hence, it is weakly coupled (g  0)
in the ultraviolet, and strongly coupled (g  ) in the infrared. the infrared behavior
of this theory has been also determined by seiberg and witten [5]. as in the previous
case the quantum moduli space of vacua is a one-dimensional complex kahler manifold
(the u-plane) and for any u there is an unbroken u(1) gauge symmetry (coulomb phase).
at a generic point on the u-plane the only light degree of freedom is the u(1) gauge eld
(together with its n = 2 superpartners). however, in this case there are three singularities
at nite values of u. these values are: u1 = 1, u2 = ei 
3 . near each of
these singularities a magnetic monopole or dyon becomes massless and weakly coupled to
a dual u(1) gauge eld.

3 and u3 = ei 

for x such that b+

2 > 1 (there are no abelian instantons) the only contributions come

14

from the three singularities. following the same arguments as in the previous case, and
assuming that the manifold x is of simple type, one nds that the contribution from the
singularity u1 takes the form:

(cid:28)e(pa

(54)

and the quantities c, hoi and hv i are constants. in (52) we have used the fact that

the contributions from the other singular points are obtained using the broken u(1)r
symmetry which in this case is zz6. this symmetry generates a zz3 symmetry on the
u-plane which acting on the observables takes the form:

(55)

under the action of the generator of zz3. the contribution from each singularity possess
a relative global factor which is obtained from the form of the gravitational anomalies
[4][20]. the nal form of the generating function (19) for manifolds of simple is [20][21]:

f (, 1, 2, . . .) = c exp(cid:16) 
6 exp(cid:16)e

where unknown constants appear as in the pure donaldson-witten case. the generating
function (56) veries a generalized form of the simple type condition (49):

3  hoi3!*exp(xa
  3

ai(a) + o)+ = 0.

(57)

unfortunately, the left-hand side of (56) is not known for any manifold x. thus we can
not x the unknown constants as we did in the case of donaldson theory (but see [37],
where a general recipe to partly determine these constants is proposed.)

15

generalized donaldson-witten theory for nf > 1 has been considered in [21][37][38].
for nf < 4 results similar to (56) are obtained for the case of manifolds of simple type.
we will not review these cases in this paper. instead we will turn our attention to the
case of some of the twisted theories which emerge from n = 4 supersymmetric theories.
unlike the n = 2 supersymmetric case, n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory
is unique once the gauge group g is xed. the microscopic theory contains a gauge or
gluon eld, four chiral spinors (the gluinos) and six real scalars. all the above elds are
massless and take values in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. as in the n = 2
case, the r-symmetry group of the n = 4 algebra can be twisted to obtain a topological
model. but since the r-symmetry is now su(4), this topological twist can be performed
in three inequivalent ways, so one ends up with three dierent tqfts [25][39][40]. the
twisted theories are topological in the sense that the partition function as well as a selected
set of correlation functions are independent of the metric which denes the background
geometry.
in the short distance regime, computations in the twisted theory are given
exactly by a saddle-point calculation around a certain bosonic background or moduli
space, and in fact the correlation functions can be reinterpreted as describing intersection
theory on this moduli space. this correspondence can be made more precise through
the mathai-quillen construction [40]. unfortunately, it is not possible to perform explicit
computations from this viewpoint: the moduli spaces one ends up with are generically
non-compact, and no precise recipe is known to properly compactify them.

as explained above, a complementary approach which sheds more light on the struc-
ture of the twisted theories and allows explicit computations involves the long-distance
regime (or strong coupling regime in the asymptotically free theories), where one expects
that a good description should be provided by the degrees of freedom of the vacuum states
of the physical theory on ir4. we have seen above how this program works for the n = 2
theories, and it would be interesting to see whether similar constructions work for the
n = 4 theories.
while for the tqfts related to asymptotically free n = 2 theories the interest lies
in their ability to dene topological invariants for four-manifolds, for the twisted n = 4
theories the topological character is used as a tool for performing explicit computations
which might shed light on the structure of the physical n = 4 theory. this theory
is nite and conformally invariant, and is conjectured to have a symmetry exchanging
strong and weak coupling and exchanging electric and magnetic elds, which extends to
a full sl(2, zz) symmetry acting on the microscopic complexied coupling 0 [41]. it is
natural to expect that this property should be shared by the twisted theories on arbitrary
four-manifolds. this was checked by vafa and witten for one of the twisted theories
and for gauge group su(2) [25], and it was clearly mostly interesting to extend their
computation to higher rank groups and to the other twisted theories.

in [42] the u-plane approach was applied to the twisted mass-deformed n = 4 sym
theory with gauge group su(2). this theory is obtained by twisting the n = 4 sym
theory with bare masses for two of the chiral multiplets. it is a non-abelian monopole
theory as the one described above but with the monopole multiplets taking values in the
adjoint representation of the gauge group [40]. the physical theory preserves n = 2
supersymmetry, and its low-energy eective description for gauge group su(2) was given
by seiberg and witten [5], and later extended to su(n) in [43].

16

the ghost-number symmetry of the twisted theory for gauge group su(2) has an
anomaly 3(2 + 3)/4 on gravitational backgrounds. topological invariants are thus
obtained by considering the vacuum expectation value of products of observables with
ghost-numbers adding up to 3(2 + 3)/4. the relevant observables for this theory and
gauge group su(2) or so(3) are precisely the same as in the donaldson-witten theory
(8) and (9). in addition to this, since all the elds in the theory take values in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group, it is possible to enrich the theory by including non-
abelian electric and magnetic t hooft uxes [44] which should behave under sl(2, zz)
duality in a well-dened fashion [25][44].

the generating function for these correlation functions is given [42] as an integration
over the moduli space of vacua (the u-plane) of the physical theory. at a generic vacuum,
the only contribution comes from a twisted n = 2 abelian vector multiplet. the eect
of the massive modes is contained in appropriate measure factors, which also incorporate
the coupling to gravity, and in contact terms among the observables [21][22][23].

the total contribution to the generating function thus consists of an integration over
the moduli space with the singularities removed  which is non-vanishing for b+
2 (x) = 1
[21] only  plus a discrete sum over the contributions of the twisted eective theories at
each of the three singularities of the low-energy eective description [5]. the eective
theory at a given singularity contains, together with the appropriate dual photon multi-
plet, one charged hypermultiplet, which corresponds to the state becoming massless at
the singularity. the complete eective action for these massless states contains as well
certain measure factors and contact terms among the observables, which reproduce the
eect of the massive states which have been integrated out. how to determine these a
priori unknown functions was explained in [21]. the idea is as follows. at those points on
the u-plane where the (imaginary part of the) eective coupling diverges, the integral is
discontinuous at antiself-dual abelian gauge congurations. this is commonly referred to
as wall crossing. wall crossing can take place at the singularities of the moduli space 
the appropriate local eective coupling  diverges there  and, in the case of the asymp-
totically free theories, at the point at innity  the eective electric coupling diverges
owing to asymptotic freedom.

on the other hand, the nal expression for the invariants can exhibit a wall-crossing
behavior at most at u  , so the contribution to wall crossing from the integral at
the singularities at nite values of u must cancel against the contributions coming from
the eective theories there, which also display wall-crossing discontinuities. imposing this
cancellation xes almost completely the unknown functions in the contributions to the
topological correlation functions from the singularities. the nal result for the contribu-
tions from the singularities (which give the complete answer for the correlation functions
when b+
2 > 1) is written explicitly and completely in terms of the periods and the dis-
criminant of the seiberg-witten solution for the physical theory. for simply-connected
spin four-manifolds of simple type the generating function is given by:

therefore we see that, as expected, the partition function of the twisted theory transforms
as a modular form, while the topological correlation functions turn out to transform

covariantly under sl(2, zz), following a pattern which can be reproduced with a far more
simple topological abelian model [42].

the second example we will consider is the vafa-witten theory [25], which corresponds
to another non-equivalent twist of the n = 4 theory. the twisted theory does not contain
spinors, so it is well-dened on any compact, oriented four-manifold. the ghost-number
symmetry of this theory is anomaly-free, and therefore the only non-trivial topological
observable is the partition function itself. as in the above example, it is possible to
consider non-trivial gauge congurations in g/center(g)) and compute the partition
function for a xed value of the t hooft ux v  h 2(x, 1(g)). in this case, however, the
seiberg-witten approach is not available, but, as conjectured by vafa and witten, one
can nevertheless compute in terms of the vacuum degrees of freedom of the n = 1 theory
which results from giving bare masses to all the three chiral multiplets of the n = 4
theory3.
as explained in detail in [25][45][46], the twisted massive theory is topological on
kahler four-manifolds with h2,0 6= 0, and the partition function is actually invariant under
the perturbation. in the long-distance limit, the partition function is given as a nite sum
over the contributions of the discrete massive vacua of the resulting n = 1 theory. in
the case at hand, it turns that for g = su(n), the number of such vacua is given by
the sum of the positive divisors of n [43]. the contribution of each vacuum is universal
(because of the mass gap), and can be xed by comparing to known mathematical results
[25]. however, this is not the end of the story. in the twisted theory the chiral superelds
of the n = 4 theory are no longer scalars, so the mass terms can not be invariant under
the holonomy group of the manifold unless one of the mass parameters be a holomorphic
two-form .4 this spatially dependent mass term vanishes where  does, and we will
assume as in [25][27] that  vanishes with multiplicity one on a union of disjoint, smooth
complex curves ci, i = 1, . . . n of genus gi which represent the canonical divisor k of x.
the vanishing of  introduces corrections involving k whose precise form is not known
a priori. in the g = su(2) case, each of the n = 1 vacua bifurcates along each of the
components ci of the canonical divisor into two strongly coupled massive vacua. this
vacuum degeneracy is believed to stem [25][27] from the spontaneous breaking of a zz2
chiral symmetry which is unbroken in bulk.

the structure of the corrections for g = su(n)  see (63) below  suggests that
the mechanism at work in this case is not chiral symmetry breaking. indeed, near any
of the ci there is an n-fold bifurcation of the vacuum. a plausible explanation for this
degeneracy could be found in the spontaneous breaking of the center of the gauge group
(which for g = su(n) is precisely zzn ). for further details and speculations, we refer
the reader to [47]. in any case, the formula for su(n) can be computed (at least when
n is prime) along the lines explained in [25] and assuming that the resulting partition
function satises a set of non-trivial constraints which are described below.

then, for a given t hooft ux v  h 2(x, zzn ), the partition function for gauge group
3a similar approach was introduced by witten in [27] to obtain the rst explicit results for the

donaldson-witten theory just before the far more powerful seiberg-witten approach were available.

4incidentally, this is the origin of the constraint h(2,0) 6= 0 mentioned above.

where i = 0, 1, . . . n  1 are chosen independently.
the formula (63) does not apply directly to the n = 2 case. for n = 2 there are
some extra relative phases ti  see equations (5.45) and (5.46) in [25]  which are absent
for n > 2 and prime. modulo these extra phases, (63) is a direct generalization of vafa
and wittens formula. it reduces on k3 to the formula of minahan, nemeschansky, vafa
and warner [49] and generalizes their result to non-zero t hooft ux. in addition to this,
the formula has the expected properties under the modular group [25]

which is, up to some correction factors which vanish in at space, the original montonen-
olive conjecture.

there is a further property to be checked which concerns the behavior of (63) under
blow-ups. this property was heavily used in [25] and demanding it in the present case
was essential in deriving the above formula. blowing up a point on a kahler manifold x

replaces it with a new kahler manifold cx whose second cohomology lattice is h 2(cx, zz) =
h 2(x, zz)  i , where i  is the one-dimensional lattice spanned by the poincare dual of
the exceptional divisor b created by the blow-up. any allowed zzn ux bv on cx is of the
form bv = v  r, where v is a ux in x and r = b,  = 0, 1, . . . n  1. the main result

concerning (63) is that under blowing up a point on a kahler four-manifold with canonical
divisor as above, the partition functions for xed t hooft uxes have a factorization as

(0)
(0)

.

zbx,bv(0) = zx,v(0)

20

(67)

precisely the same behavior under blow-ups of the partition function (63) has been proved
by yoshioka [50] for the generating function of euler characteristics of instanton moduli
space on kahler manifolds. this should not come out as a surprise since it is known
that, on certain four-manifolds, the partition function of vafa-witten theory computes
euler characteristics of instanton moduli spaces [25][49]. therefore, (63) can be seen as a
prediction for the euler numbers of instanton moduli spaces on those four-manifolds.

in the light of the ads/cft correspondence [7][8][9], it would be mostly interesting
to investigate what the large n limit of (63) corresponds to on the gravity side, and to
extend the computation to all n. we expect to address these topics in the near future.
