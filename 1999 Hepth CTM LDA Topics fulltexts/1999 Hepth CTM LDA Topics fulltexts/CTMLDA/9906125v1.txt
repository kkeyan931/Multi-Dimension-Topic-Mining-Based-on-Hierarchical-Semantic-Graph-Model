abstract

the exact expression for wilson loop averages winding n times on a closed

contour is obtained in two dimensions for pure u (n ) yang-mills theory and,

rather surprisingly, it displays an interesting duality in the exchange n  n .
the large-n limit of our result is consistent with previous computations.

moreover we discuss the limit of small loop area a, keeping n2a xed, and
nd it coincides with the zero-instanton approximation. we deduce that

small loops, both at nite and innite volume, are blind to instantons.

next we check the non-perturbative result by resumming t hooft-cpv and

wu-mandelstam-leibbrandt (wml)-prescribed perturbative series, the for-

mer being consistent with the exact result, the latter reproducing the zero-

instanton contribution. a curious interplay between geometry and algebraic

invariants is observed. finally we compute the spectral density of the wilson

loop operator, at large n , via its fourier representation, both for t hooft

and wml: for small area they exhibit a gap and coincide when the theory is

considered on the sphere s2.

i. introduction

the non-perturbative structure of non-abelian quantum gauge theories is still a chal-

lenging topic in spite of a large amount of eorts in this direction. whereas perturbation

theory provides a well-established computational tool to describe the weak coupling regime,

quantitative predictions for the behaviour of the strongly-coupled theory are extremely hard

to be found. in the last few years much attention has been devoted to derive exact results

in the supersymmetric case, by exploiting duality properties [1,2]. nevertheless we believe a

traditional eld theory approach is appealing, most of all in comparing perturbative and

non-perturbative aspects.

in particular this approach becomes crucial in the light-front formulation of quantum

gauge theories [3]: though some non-perturbative features are thought to be transparent, a

consistent framework in the continuum is still lacking. moreover the relation with the usual

perturbative equal-time quantization remains unclear.

such problems have recently been tackled in the simplied context of two-dimensional

gauge theories (y m2), taking advantage of the lattice solutions [4]. as far as the continuum

is concerned, in two dimensions the theory seems trivial when quantized in the light-cone

gauge. as a matter of fact, in the absence of dynamical fermions, it looks indeed free, being

described by a lagrangian quadratic in the elds.

still topological degrees of freedom occur if the theory is put on a (partially or totally)

compact manifold, whereas the simpler behaviour enforced by the light-cone gauge condi-

tion on the plane entails a severe worsening in its infrared structure. these features are

related aspects of the same basic issue: even in two dimensions the theory contains non triv-

ial dynamics, as immediately suggested by other gauge choices as well as by perturbative

calculations of gauge invariant quantities, typically of wilson loops [5]. one can say that,

in light-cone gauge, dynamics gets hidden in the very singular nature of correlators at large

distances (ir singularities).

the rst quantity that comes to mind is the two-point correlator.

if the theory is

3

quantized in the gauge a = 0 at equal-times, the free propagator has the following causal
expression (wml prescription) in two dimensions

++ (x) =

,

rst proposed by t.t. wu [6]. in turn this propagator is nothing but the restriction in two

dimensions of the expression proposed by s. mandelstam [7] and g. leibbrandt [8] in four

dimensions and derived by means of a canonical quantization in ref. [9]. in the equal-time

formulation, the causal behaviour is induced by the propagation of unphysical degrees of

freedom (probability ghosts), which can be expunged from the physical hilbert space,

but still contribute in intermediate lines as timelike photons do in the qed gupta-bleuler

quantization.

in dimensions higher than two, where physical degrees of freedom are switched on

(transverse gluons), this causal prescription is the only acceptable one; indeed causality is

mandatory in order to get correct analyticity properties, which in turn are the basis of any

consistent renormalization program [10]. it has been shown in perturbative calculations [11]

that agreement with feynman gauge results can only be obtained if a causal propagator is

used in light-cone gauge.

the situation is somewhat dierent in exactly two dimensions. here the theory can

be quantized on the light-front (at equal x+); with such a choice, no dynamical degrees of

freedom occur as the non-vanishing component of the vector eld does not propagate

dp
++(x) = 

i
2|x| (x+),

(2)

but rather gives rise to an instantaneous (in x+) coulomb-like potential. on the other hand,

renormalization is no longer a concern for a pure yang-mills theory in two dimensions.

a formulation based essentially on the potential in eq. (2) was originally proposed by

g. t hooft in 1974 [12], to derive beautiful solutions for the q q-bound state problem under

the form of rising regge trajectories.

when inserted in perturbative wilson loop calculations, expressions (1) and (2) lead

to completely dierent results, as rst noticed in ref. [5]. the origin of this discrepancy

4

was eventually understood in ref. [13], where it was shown that genuine non-perturbative

excitations (instantons) are necessary in the equal-time formulation (eq. (1)) in order

to obtain the exact result, which in turn is easily recovered in the light-front formulation

(eq. (2)) just by summing the perturbative series. this surprising feature strengthens the

belief that the light-front vacuum may indeed be much simpler than the one in the equal-time

formulation, at least in two dimensions.

in order to gain a deeper insight in the dierent physics described by either t hooft

or wml prescription, we have decided to study a wider class of loops, i.e. loops winding

around themselves an arbitrary number of times. actually, their knowledge appear to be

intimately related [14] to the general solution of the makeenko-migdal equations at large

n [15]. furthermore, in the large-n limit, the spectral density of the eigenvalues of the

wilson operator is completely determined in terms of such loops. remarkably this spectral

density carries non-trivial information about the master eld [16] of the theory even on the

plane. therefore it seems natural to explore winding loops using both the perturbative

wml prescription and the t hooft one in order to understand whether instanton eects

are still able to distinguish between the two.

in sect. ii we start by deriving wilson loops at nite n and arbitrary n on the plane

from the non-perturbative solution on the sphere s2. to our knowledge an explicit formula,

obtained by decompactication, appears in literature for the rst time and extends previous

results limited to a small number of windings [17,18]. it contains all instanton contributions

and turns out to correspond to the exact resummation of the perturbative series dened

via t hooft propagator. once again light-front quantization seems to capture the correct

vacuum of the theory. on the other hand, by isolating the zero-instanton contribution on

the sphere, we end up with the perturbative resummation of wml expressed in terms of a

laguerre polynomial. hence the picture is fully consistent with our previous investigations

[13,19].

having the general expression for a wilson loop of u(n) with n windings, we are enabled

to perform dierent limits covering complementary regimes of the theory. first of all, in

5

the large-n limit with g2n xed, we recover the well-known result of [17,20] in terms of
a laguerre polynomial. surprisingly enough, taking instead n to innity and keeping n2a
xed, the perturbative result of wml is reproduced. we can explain the latter behaviour by

observing that, having the instantons a nite size, small loops are essentially blind to them.

this also teaches us, as we will investigate further in the sequel, that a remnant of the weak

phase on the sphere survives the decompactication limit. in fact one can as well study

the same limit directly at nite total area and what is found is precisely the zero-instanton

contribution. the parallelism of the limits n   and n  , reected by the same
functional form, has to be ascribed to the symmetry of the general formula for the wilson

loop under the exchange n  n, up to a rescaling of the area.

the next step consists in computing the same quantities by means of the perturbative

expansion. this is not simply a check of the correctness of the previous interpretation, but

also casts light on the interplay between geometry and colour in the dierent prescriptions,

and is done in sect. iii. whereas for wml the resummation of the full perturbative series

is a straightforward generalization of the computation performed in [21] for n = 1, the

analog with t hooft unveils the full non-abelian character of such a prescription. due to its

complexity, we have restricted ourselves to the calculation of the wilson loop with winding
n to o(g4): as we will see, at this level already a large amount of classes of diagrams
need being considered. as a matter of fact, we have realized that adopting wml all the

diagrams contributing to a given perturbative order entails the same geometrical factor, so

that only the structure of the colour traces is relevant. fortunately the sum of the colour

factor is encoded in the matrix integral of [21]. at variance with wml, t hooft prescription

leads to dierent geometrical integrals for dierent classes of graphs, which, together with

the colour traces, complicate the resummation of the perturbative series. still, in this

framework we have been able to describe the mechanism underlying both the limits n  
and n  . it is rather amusing to observe how the latter limit precisely selects a class
of diagram whose geometrical factor is the same as in wml, explaining in this case the

perturbative resummation with wml. when performing the former limit the situation is

6

trivial from an algebraic point of view (only non-crossed diagrams contribute), while the sum

over geometrical factors is quite involved. we have evaluated it by exploiting the symmetry

under the exchange n  n, which shows a curious interplay between geometry and the
algebraic invariants.

finally in sect. iv we have applied previously derived results to the computation of

the spectral function in the large-n limit. in the t hooft case the situation is well-known

[16,22], a gap appears when the area of the loop is below a critical value, resembling the

weak-phase behaviour of the same quantity on the sphere. the novelty comes out with

wml, for which a gap was expected at any value of the area, since instanton excitations

should be neglected. on the contrary the gap is present only for suciently small loops and,

in this case, again the density coincides with the same quantity on the sphere in the weak

phase.

conclusions are drawn in sect. v, whereas technical details are deferred to appendices

a and b.

ii. the wilson loop with winding number n

7

is over the u(n) group manifold and r(s) is the character of the group element u in the

r (s) representation. we immediately notice that wn = wn.

eqs. (3), (4) can be easily deduced from the solution of yang-mills theory on the cylinder,

using the fact that the hamiltonian evolution is governed by the laplacian on u(n): we call

eqs. (3),(4) the heat-kernel representations of z(a) and wn(a  a,a), respectively.

in order to evaluate wn(aa,a) in the decompactication limit we write them explicitly

explicitly, using the well-known formula for the characters in terms of the set mi.

in this section we will study the partition function (3) and the wilson loop (4) in the

limit of innite area, by showing they are dominated by particular representations labelled

by suitable indices { mi}. let us suppose n odd, so that the term (n  1)/2 in the casimir

with all possible permutations, for which the minimum value of the casimir is reached and

reads

we now turn to the wilson loop (6). thanks to its symmetry, we can always choose k = 1

after writing explicitly the vandermonde determinants and taking into account the symme-

1if n is even, (n  1)/2 will be half-integer, but this does not alter our conclusions.

(17)

the series is actually a nite sum, stopping at k = n  1 or k = n  1, depending on the
smaller one. some comments are now in order. first of all we notice that when n > 1 the

simple abelian-like exponentiation is lost. in other words the theory starts to feel its non-

abelian nature as the appearance of dierent string tensions makes clear: the coulomb

law is violated and the combinatorial coecients in (17) are intimately related, as we will

see in the following, to the presence of instanton contributions to light-front vacuum. actu-

ally, from the sphere point of view, (17) can be understood as coming from an instantons

resummation. indeed, as rst noted by witten [23], it is possible to represent z(a) and
wn(a  a,a) as a sum over unstable instantons, where each instanton contribution is as-
sociated to a nite, but not trivial, perturbative expansion. in ref. [13], as conrmed by

10

the computation on the torus in [19], it was shown that if only the zero-instanton sector is

considered, in the decompactication limit one exactly recovers the sum of the perturbative

series for n = 1, in which the light-cone gauge yang-mills propagator is wml-prescribed

(1). precisely we had for the zero-instanton case

w (0)

4 (cid:21) l(1)

this has to be contrasted with the full result coming from (17)

w1 = exp(cid:20)

g2n a

4

(cid:21) ,

(19)

(20)

giving the expected area-law exponentiation, that can be easily derived directly on the plane

by resumming the perturbative series in which the light-cone propagator is cp v -prescribed

according to t hooft [12]. actually, in the large-n limit, (19) does not exhibit connement,
as rst noticed in [21]. as a matter of fact from (19), taking the limit n   (g2 = g2n),

1 =r 2
g2a
however, this is hardly surprising since w (0)
1 does not contain any genuine non-perturbative
contribution, and simply reproduces the wilson loop behaviour of the weak-coupling phase

j1(cid:16)p2g2a(cid:17);

nw (0)

lim

(21)

of the sphere [24], where instantons are suppressed [25,26,22].

for a general winding n, eq. (17) is therefore expected to come out from the resummation of

t hooft perturbative series, that corresponds to a light-front quantization of the theory [5].

on the other hand to neglect instantons, and then to send the area of the sphere to innity,

is likely to reproduce the wml computation: the perturbative analysis will conrm these

claims. at the moment we need the zero instanton contribution to (17):

it can be easily

obtained, closely following ref. [13], by applying a poisson resummation to (6) and taking
the non-exponentially suppressed terms as g2  0

(22)

(23)

the above result is quite dierent from (17) and reects much more dramatically the same

discrepancy found for n = 1: the string tension is independent from n and there is no

trace of the non-abelian nature, since dierent exponential weights do not appear. actually,
the behaviour of w (0)
exactly the same as in the abelian u(1) theory. it is easily proved for u(1) that

(the wml one) is, with respect to the fundamental winding n = 1,

n

wn(a; 1) = exp(cid:20)

g2a n2

4

(cid:21) ,

(24)

the n windings resulting trivially in replacing the charge g by gn. the wml result satises

the same rule as it is clearly seen from (23)

n (g2a; n) = w (0)
w (0)

1 (g2n2a; n) .

(25)

in this perspective the exact (i.e. full instantons t hooft) result does not seem related to

any simple-minded reduction u(n)  u(1)n , suggested by the abelianization of the theory
in axial gauges; rather a non-trivial (non-abelian) eect is present there.

we can further observe another basic dierence between eq. (17) and eq. (23): as a

matter of fact, the former shows an interesting symmetry between n and n. more precisely,

we have that

wn(a; n) = wn ( a; n)

a =

n
n a ,

(26)

a relation that is far from being trivial, involving an unexpected interplay between the

geometrical and the algebraic structure of the theory. looking at eq. (26), the abelian-like

exponentiation for u(n) when n = 1 appears to be connected to the u(1) loop with n

12

windings, the genuine triviality of maxwell theory providing the expected behaviour for

the string tension. moreover we notice the intriguing feature that the large-n limit (with n

xed) is equivalent to the limit in which an innite number of windings is considered with

vanishing rescaled loop area. alternatively, this rescaling could be thought to aect the
coupling constant g2  n
nevertheless it is related, in a particular dynamical limit, to the full result, as we will see in

n g2. eq. (23), of course, does not exhibit such a fancy behaviour;

the following.

let us discuss in detail the large-n limit of eq. (17): it was obtained long ago by kazakov

and kostov [17]2, who solved the makeenko-migdal equations in the case at hand. coming
back to eq. (15), we introduce the function wn(a; n) from

wn(a; n) = exp(cid:20)

g2ann

4

(cid:21) wn(a; n) ,

that can be expressed through a contour integral

wn(a; n) =

(c is a contour surrounding the origin of the complex plane). the binomial sum can be

performed and, after reversing the path around the pole at t = 1 and nally changing

. (28)

the case n  n is easily obtained from eq. (17) by exploiting the symmetry between n and
n (eq. (26)).

2the explicit form for nite n and small n (n = 2, 3) can be deduced from [17] and [18]. the

latter used a non-abelian version of stokes theorem, and both are consistent with our general

formula (17).

13

eq. (28) is a nice representation for the wilson loop with n windings, which is particularly

suitable to discuss the large-n limit. actually, rescaling z into z

using eq. (26) we are able to perform another limit, namely n   with xed n2 a

eq. (32) exactly coincides with the wml result eq. (23): this means that in the small area

limit (taking n   in order to have a non-vanishing interaction) we essentially recover the
zero-instanton, i.e. perturbative, approximation, even from the exact formula eq. (17). the

same behaviour will show up when studying the spectral density for wilson loop eigenvalues

(see sect. iv). once again the reason for the equivalence of eqs. (32) and (23) is founded on

the non-trivial geometrical aspects encoded in eq. (17). in fact, we recall that in eq. (23)

we have neglected the instanton contributions: we expect that suciently small loops are

unaected by instantons due to their having a typical length scale measured by their size.

eq. (32) supports this intuitive argument.

this conclusion is not limited to the decompactied case: we can go further and prove

that, even at nite total area a, the exact heat-kernel expression eq. (6) reduces to eq. (22)
when n   3. introducing  = n2 a, we can write eq. (6) as

3we need to have n   with n2 a xed so that the interaction is nite.

this conrms our guess that suciently small loops do not see instantons: actually it is

known that in the strong phase (at large-n) small loops behave as in the weak phase (i.e.

they do not conne) as n  . our result goes further, revealing that even at nite n and
at nite total area a, instantons can be dynamically suppressed.

iii. the perturbative wml and t hooft prescriptions

we now turn to the resummation of the perturbative expansion for wn. the aim of our
investigation is not only to check the correctness of the interpretation of the non-perturbative

results derived so far, but more importantly to observe and explain a curious interplay

between geometry and colour factors in the two dierent prescriptions. we will begin with

wml, for which the resummation of the perturbative series is found through a simple

generalization of the procedure outlined in [21] in the case n = 1. this is due to all diagrams

entailing the same geometrical factor. we will then switch to t hooft prescription and realize

16

the resummation is rather involved since graphs belonging to the same class, according to

their colour factor, produce dierent geometrical integrals. hence, in this respect, light-front

quantization exhibits its peculiar non-abelian character.

a. resummation of the perturbative series dened via wml prescription

we closely follow the procedure outlined in [21]. in the euclidean space the perturbative

expansion of wn is

xk=1

wn[a] = 1 +

1
n

(g2)kz 1

0

ds1 x1(s1)  z s2k1

0

ds2k x2k (s2k) tr [g12k (x1,   , x2k)] ,
(36)

where x(s), s  [0, 1] parametrizes the contour with n windings. the lie algebra-valued
2k-point green function g12k (x1,   , x2k) has to be expressed via the wick rule in terms
of the free propagator d(xi  xj), in the light cone gauge a = 0 and endowed with (wick-
rotated) wml prescription

++(x  x) =
dab

1
2

ab x+  x+
x  x

.

(37)

the simplest choice for the contour is a circle wrapping around itself n times. then it

happens [21] that the weighted basic correlator is independent of the loop variables, since

x(s) x(s)

x+(s)  x+(s)
x(s)  x(s)

= 2(nr)2 .

after that, the integration over the path parameters s1,   , s2k trivially yields 1/(2k)! and
the task of determining the wilson loop reduces to the purely combinatorial problem of

nding the group factors corresponding to the wick contractions. what is left is

wn[a] = 1 +

1
n



xk=1(cid:18)

2 (cid:19)k c2k(n)
g2 n2 a

(2k)!

,

where c2k(n) is the sum over all possible traces of 2k t a matrices suitably contracted.

fortunately this group factor is generated by a matrix integral [21], and the nal result

reads

(38)

reproducing the zero-instanton result eq. (23) obtained via non-perturbative methods.

b. resummation of the perturbative series dened via t hooft prescription

as already hinted, we were not able to resum the full perturbative expansion for wn pre-
scribed with t hooft. we believe after exertion that such a formidable task is, if not

impossible, at least extremely tough. nevertheless we were successful in the computation of
the wilson loop with n windings at o(g4), which suces to give a avour on how things work
at higher orders. moreover we performed the limit n  , n2a xed, and, by exploiting
the duality n  n, the large-n limit, with g2n xed.

firstly, let us start from the perturbative denition of wn in the light-cone gauge (a =

0)

wn =

evaluated at j a = 0. it easy to recognize that eq. (39) can be rewritten as follows

wn =

 j a(x)

,

(40)

where now the propagator d(x  y) is dened through the cpv prescription eq. (2). we
consider a light-like rectangle with sides 2l, 2t (see fig. 1) and choose the currents with

support on the contour, so that

j a(x+, x) = ja

u (x  l) + ja

d (x + l) .

with this choice the perturbative expansion eq. (40) for wn reads

(41)

with c 1 and c 2 as in fig. 1. clearly in the limit ja

u, ja

d  0 the only non-vanishing

contributions are those with a matching number of derivatives with respect to ju and jd.

now everything is settled and we can easily derive the expression of w (4)

n , i.e. the wilson
loop with n windings o(g4). the following prefactor is common to all classes of diagrams

g4 (i l)2 (2 t )2 = 

g4 a2
4

,

(42)

a = 4lt being the area of the loop. as a matter of fact, g4 comes from four derivatives
with respect to the currents which contribute at this order, (i l)2 is produced when two

derivatives act on the last exponential in eq. (41), which represents the only non-vanishing

contribution, and nally (2 t )2 is given by integration over the loop variables. notice the

expected dependence on the area due to invariance with respect to area-preserving dieo-

morphisms typical of d = 2.

in appendix a we show which classes of non-crossed and crossed diagrams contribute to

w (4)
n and also provide the exact counting (as a function of n) and area factor. the latter
turns out to be either 1

2 or 1 depending on the presence of integrals in the loop variables
which are nested as a consequence of the denition of the p exponential. furthermore one
has to take into account that non-crossed diagrams produce an additional factor n 3/4 from

tr (cid:2)t a t a t b t b(cid:3), whereas the analog for crossed diagrams is n/4 from tr (cid:2)t a t b t a t b(cid:3).

remember eventually the factor 1/n appearing in eq. (41).

we present here the nal results, which read

w (4), nc
w (4), c

n =

n 2(cid:0)2n2 + 1(cid:1)

(44)

and, summing up,

w (4)

n = 

g4 a2 n2

96

(cid:0)2n2n 2 + n 2 + n2  1(cid:1) ,

(45)

which coincides with the coecient o(g4) of the expansion of eq. (17) obtained via non-
perturbative methods. moreover, already at this level, the symmetry under the exchange

n  n is manifest once the area is rescaled by n/n.

let us now go back to eq. (41) in order to extrapolate the relevant limits n   and
n  . we have already stressed that they are dual to each other (provided the loop area
is suitably rescaled), so that we will explicitly perform only the former and deduce the latter
by symmetry. in sect. ii the large-n limit of the non-perturbative wn, with an2 xed, was
proved to coincide with the resummation of the perturbative series when wml prescription
was adopted and a  an2. thus we guess that at large n dominant congurations of
loop diagrams where t hooft prescription is imposed must be weighted by the same area

factor. this precisely happens for wml as we realized in sect. iiia. in fact, by inspecting
the computation of wn at order o(g4) we are easily convinced that in this limit dominant
congurations, either crossed or non-crossed, are those which spread through the maximum

number of sheets of the n-fold loop, i.e. those in which the vector elds are all attached
on dierent sides of the loop. for instance the leading terms at o(g4) are those shown in
figs. 1i, 2d. going further, at a generic order g2k one needs at least 2k sheets in order to set

up such congurations, and their number is straightforwardly determined. actually, there

are(cid:0) n

2k(cid:1) ways of extracting 2k sheets out of n and in addition we have to take into account all

possible congurations of the basic 2k-sheet structure with any kind of cross-over. therefore,

the counting of dominant congurations is given by

n!

(2k)! (n  2k)!  c2k(n) ,

(46)

where c2k(n) is the coecient we acquainted with in sect. iiia. hence, at the leading order

in n, we end up with

wn(a) =

1
n



xk=0(cid:18)

2 (cid:19)k c2k(n)
g2 a n2

(2k)!

20

(47)

and, switching to the euclidean space via a wick rotation

wn(a) =

4

g2 a n2(cid:21) l(1)

n1(cid:18)g2 a n2
2 (cid:19) ,

(48)

which corresponds to eq. (23).

the next step consists in performing the large-n limit of the resummed perturbative

series in the axial gauge with the light-cone cpv prescription. the duality n  n allows
us to conclude

wn(a) =

1
n

exp(cid:20)

1
4

g2 a n(cid:21) l(1)

n1(cid:18) g2 a n
2 (cid:19) ,

(49)

where the rescaling in eq. (26) is understood. apart from the numerical coincidence, the

duality entails a deep relation among dierent faces of the same theory. naively one could

think that the large-n limit, being dominated by non-crossed graphs in which the trace

factor considerably simplies, is easy to recover . nevertheless, a surprising complexity in

the integrals over loop variables arises, since every class of diagrams is characterized by a

dierent area factor. this is already manifest from the computation of the wilson loop

at order g4 (see appendix a). thus the most relevant conclusion we can draw is that an

enlightening interplay between geometry and algebraic invariants takes place, connecting

the large-n with the large-n limit and, in a sense, the strong and the weak phase of the

theory.

iv. the spectral density

u(n) yang-mills theory on the sphere s2 exhibits in the large-n limit with g2 n xed, a

third order phase transition (douglas-kazakov (dk) phase transition) [24]. according to

the total area a of the sphere, two dierent regimes occur: a strong coupling regime when

a > 2 (in suitable units, i.e. g2 n

2 = 1) and a weak coupling regime with a < 2. the

dierence between them can be traced back to the presence of instantons on the sphere

[25,26,22], which fully contribute for large a, but are instead exponentially suppressed in

the weak-coupling phase.

21

the two regimes can be conveniently characterized by the density  of young tableaux

indices which single out the various irreducible representations of the group u(n).

in

the strong coupling regime the distribution  undergoes a phenomenon of saturation in

the large-n limit, namely it is equal to one in a nite interval of its domain. in turn, if

we consider a wilson loop on the sphere with the contour c running around an equator

and winding an arbitrary number n of times, the density  is related by a kind of duality

transformation [22] to the spectral density  on the unit circle of the eigenvalues of the

unitary operator uc, representing the loop.

the strong-coupling phase is characterized by the fact that those eigenvalues completely

ll the unit circle, whereas in the weak coupling regime a gap develops where the distribution

 vanishes. before decompactifying the sphere to the plane by taking the limit a  , we
have to learn how the density  evolves when we replace the equatorial contour with a smooth

arbitrary one. in ref. [22] it is shown that, when one of the two dierent areas generated in

this way, let us call it a, becomes small enough, a gap in the eigenvalue distribution appears
even in the strong dk phase (i.e. for a > 2). actually, when the total area a approaches
its critical value 2 from above, a becomes critical at its maximum value acr = 2
when the contour is along an equator.

2 , namely

when the sphere is decompactied to the plane by taking the limit a   at xed a,
we are automatically in the dk strong phase; it is then remarkable that acr reaches, in the
limit a  , a well dened value, acr = 4.

we are going to obtain all these results from the explicit expressions we got in sect. ii for

wilson loops with an arbitrary winding number wn. we shall explicitly discuss the large-n
case on the plane (a  ). the spectral density (a, ), a being the area enclosed by the
loop, is related to wn by the following fourier series [14]

(a, ) =

1

2 "1 + 2



xn=1

cos(n)wn# .

(50)

we shall compute this function and show that, according to dierent values of a, a gap
may develop in the -variable in which the distribution vanishes. this phenomenon was

22

rst noticed by durhuus and olesen [16], who derived the spectral function solving a kind

of makeenko-migdal equation with suitable boundary conditions.

by introducing eq. (31) into eq. (50) we get

(a, ) =

here we have used a well-known integral representation for the laguerre polynomials in

which the integration contour  encircles the origin of the complex t-plane.

the logarithm in turn can be analytically continued; as is well known, it has branch points

when its argument either vanishes or diverges. whereas it is easy to realize that the only

divergence occurs, at nite |t|, at t = 0, a careful study of the roots of the trascendental
equation

ea(t+ 1

2 )+i (cid:18)1 +

1

t(cid:19) = 1

is in order before drawing any conclusion.

it is amusing to notice that the change of variable

t =

exp(i)
1  exp(i)

(55)

(56)

turns eq. (55) into eq.(3.4) of ref. [16].

to the success of our calculation it is essential that the contour  in eq. (52) can be

deformed while the logarithm still remaining single-valued on it.

23

the discussion of the roots of eq. (55) is deferred to appendix b. there we show that,

for a > 4, only two roots are possible and only one of them is encircled by the contour .
if we set t = x + iy and denote this root by the values (x, y), which obviously are functions

of a and of , a cut can be drawn along the segment (0, 0)(x, y) in the complex t-plane
and the contour  can be deformed to the contour , encircling the branch points and just

running below and above the cut. it is then immediate to conclude that

and that, eventually,

f (a, ) = x + iy

(a, ) =

1

(cid:18)x +

1

2(cid:19) .

(57)

as long as a > 4, x + 1

2 is positive for any value of . the eigenvalues are lling the

entire interval (, ).

when a < 4 the situation dramatically changes. although we are in the strong dk
phase (we are on the plane), a gap starts showing up in the eigenvalue density for  close to

 ( and to ; remember  is an even function of ). actually, for a < 4, there is a value
cr <  such that x(a, cr) =  1
2. once this value of  is reached, x remains equal to  1
2,
and consequently  vanishes.

in appendix b we show that the expression for cr coincides with the one in eq.(4.8) of

ref. [16], namely

cr =ra  a2

4

+ arccos(cid:18)1  a
2(cid:19) .

(58)

eventually, in the limit a  0, the density approaches the periodic -distribution, as it
should.

actually we have already seen in sect. ii that, in the small-a limit, instantons on the
sphere are suppressed even in the strong dk phase. this phenomenon has a simple geomet-

rical interpretation: it occurs when one of the two areas singled out by the loop gets small

when compared to the instanton size. it might then seem that the dierent behaviour of

24

 according to the values of a, is fully driven and characterized by instantons. this issue
would in turn be of crucial relevance in singling out peculiar properties of the light-front vac-

uum when compared to the one in equal-time canonical fock space after decompactication

of the sphere to the plane.

unfortunately the situation is not as simple as that. in ref. [13] the contribution to the

wilson loop from the zero-instanton sector on s2 was clearly pointed out. it was also noticed

that, in the decompactication limit, this contribution exactly coincides with the sum of the

perturbative series when graphs are evaluated according to the wml prescription for the

propagator. in sect. ii we have generalized this result to a loop with an arbitrary winding

number n. it is then a fairly simple exercise to take the large-n limit and to insert the

result in eq. (50)

m l =

1

2 "1 + 2



xn=1

cos(n)

na

j1(2n

a)# ,

    ,

(59)

j1 being the usual bessel function. of course its geometrical meaning is now completely

dierent.

still, due to the absence of instantons, one would naively believe that m l should behave

like in a weak phase, in particular should develop a gap. but this is not always the case; as

a matter of fact, using a standard integral representation for the bessel function, we get

m l =

2

 z 1

1

dt1  t2 p ( + 2t

a),

p being the periodic -distribution, leading to

m l =

(2m + )2

4a

,

    ,

(60)

(61)

the sum running over all positive and negative values of m such that the argument of the

square root is positive.

it is easy to check that this expression reproduces the limits

m l =

lim
a

1
2

25

and

m l = ().

lim
a0

for a < 2

4 there is indeed a gap, similar to the one in the weak phase on the sphere,

but with a new threshold. for larger values the gap disappears.

only the functional form (a square root) is reminiscent of a weak phase. there are

moreover discontinuities in the derivative of the density anytime a new value of m starts

contributing.

one would eventually conclude that the occurrence of a gap is not directly related to the

presence of instantons on s2; even in the zero instanton sector, after decompactication, no

gap occurs for suciently large values of a. only when a is small enough, the complete and
the zero-instanton solution exhibit similar behaviours. we emphasize that this statement

has to be proven, since the limits n   and a  0 could in principle not commute. for
small area, only the term with m = 0 contributes to the summation eq. (61), and therefore

we deduce m l

cr = 2a. this is precisely the leading term in the expansion of eq. (58), so
that the two values of cr coincides at small area. let us now show that also (a, ) eq. (57)
and m l(a, ) have a similar behaviour for small a. as  < cr, by dening  =  cr, we
can write

m l =

1  2 .

a

(62)

notice that the last factor in eq. (62) is nite as a  0. by comparing eq. (62) and eq. (57),
we expect that the solutions (x, y) of eq. (55) behave for small a as ( 1
), a and b
being nite numbers. as a matter of fact, solving the trascendental equation eq. (55) with

(64)

which is just eq. (62).

its precise meaning is elucidated if we remember that (a, ) has a distribution character

on the other hand, at large areas, the genuinely perturbative solution (i.e. the one

coming from the equal-time quantization and corresponding to the zero-instanton sector),

becomes less and less reliable.

to gain a better insight, we consider again the zero-instanton sector on s2, before decom-
pactication. eq. (22) teaches us that this is easily achieved by replacing a with (aa)a

it is amusing to notice that the critical value for a is now again acr = 2 and that, below

such a critical value, the ml spectral distribution exactly coincides with the one in the weak

dk phase on the sphere [24].

actually, from eq. (22), we can derive a stronger result; we can indeed follow the evo-

lution of the critical area of the loop as a function of the size of the sphere also for the

zero-instanton sector. as a matter of fact, eq. (61) becomes

v. conclusions

the main concern of this paper was to gain a better insight in the dynamics of y m2 by

considering the class of wilson loops winding n times around a closed smooth contour,

either on a compact manifold (s2) or on the plane. as already noticed by several authors,

thanks to the invariance under area-preserving dieomorphisms, these loops carry enough

information to characterize the theory in the large-n limit.

our deepest result is probably eq. (26). it shows a curious interplay between two integral

numbers, n characterizing the internal symmetry group and n representing the number of

windings along the contour. in a geometrical language, the latter controls the displacement

of the connection on the base manifold, the former is related to displacements along the group

ber. in two dimensions, the winding n has essentially a topological character, as it appears

in the n-th power of the group element uc; the wilson loop can then be interpreted as

a generalized clebsch-gordan coecient intertwining dierent u(n) representations. this

is, we believe, the root of eq. (26) and, of course, it entails far-reaching consequences. in

particular it relates the abelian-like exponentiation for u(n) when n = 1 to the genuine

triviality of the maxwell theory (n = 1) for any n.

all these features are reproduced in a perturbative context. actually concrete exam-

ples of dierent colour and geometrical interplays are explicitly exhibited, according to the

dierent expressions used for the vector propagator (either wml or t hooft). when the

t hooft propagator is used the perturbative series leads to the exact result. however, for

28

n > 1, the wilson loop feels the non-abelian nature of the theory. the winding number n

probes its colour content. the related light-front vacuum, although simpler than the one in

the equal-time quantization, as it automatically takes instanton contributions into account,

cannot be considered trivial.

a more intriguing result concerns the limit n   keeping n2a xed, namely the
in such a limit (eq. (32)), one exactly recovers the contribution of the

small-area limit.

zero-instanton sector, namely eq. (23). intuitively this can be understood by remember-

ing that instantons possess a typical length scale measured by their size. one might then

be tempted to conclude that the phase transition at large n is completely driven by in-

stantons. unfortunately this characterization is true only for small areas, when instantons

cannot contribute. in sect. iv it is shown that, for areas larger than a critical threshold, the

spectral function which characterizes the eigenvalue distribution in the exact solution, when

computed retaining only the zero-instanton sector, does not exhibit any gap. at large areas,

the genuinely perturbative solution (i.e. the one coming from the equal-time quantization

and corresponding to the zero-instanton sector), becomes less and less reliable, as expected

on a general ground. it is then quite remarkable that the perturbative light-front resum-

mation succeeds in reproducing not only the correct string tension, but also the non-trivial

corrections (see eq. (17)) due to colour-winding factors, the winding number n carrying the

information about the non-abelian topology.

one should perhaps conclude with a comment concerning higher dimensional cases, in

particular the dimension d = 4. we believe that most of our results are typical of the

two-dimensional case. perturbation theory at d = 2 +  is discontinuous in the limit   0
[5,27]; on the other hand the invariance under area-preserving dieomorphisms is lost when

d > 2. in a perturbative picture the presence of massless transverse degrees of freedom

(the gluons) forces a causal behaviour upon the relevant green functions, whereas in the

soft (ir) limit they get mixed with the vacuum. the light-front vacuum, which also in two

dimensions is far from being trivial, in higher dimensions is likely to be simpler only as far

as topological degrees of freedom are concerned. of course there is no reason why it should

29

coincide with the physical vacuum since, after connement, the spectrum is likely to contain

only massive excitations. moreover, to be realistic, matter should be introduced, both

in the fundamental and in the adjoint representation. therefore, before going to higher

dimensions, our two-dimensional considerations should perhaps be generalized to the case

in which matter is present. although many papers have appeared to this regard in the

recent literature, we feel that further work is still needed to reach a complete understanding.

vi. appendix a: wn o(g

4) with t hooft prescription

in this appendix we explicitly compute wn at order o(g4). we have seen in sect. iii
that at this order all diagrams come with the prefactor given by eq. (42). we now have

to group all possible diagrams in dierent classes according to their contribution either to

tr (cid:2)t a t a t b t b(cid:3) (non-crossed diagrams) or to tr (cid:2)t a t b t a t b(cid:3) (crossed diagrams), and to

the area factor. we then have to specify how many of them belong to each class (depending

on the number of windings n) and the area factor they produce 4. such numbers are

summarized in the following tables: table i refers to non-crossed diagrams depicted in fig. 2,

whereas table ii to crossed ones depicted in fig. 3. finally, summing up the contributions

from all loops, each multiplied by the prefactor (42), the proper trace and area factor, and

taking into account the multiplicity, we recover the result announced in (45) for the wilson
loop with n windings at order o(g4).

vii. appendix b

in this appendix we will sketchily show that eq. (55) admits two solutions and, of these,

only one can be encircled by the integration contour. let us start from eq. (55), which,

4recall it is either 1

2 or 1 depending on whether there are nested integrals in the loop variables

or not.

2 ) ei(ay) = 1 .

(70)

the rst obvious symmetry to be noticed is (x, y, )  (x,y,). in addition, by taking
the absolute value of eq. (70), the symmetry x  x  1 is also manifest. combining
eq. (70) and its complex conjugate, we obtain an equation for the shape of the boundary

which separates the region of convergence of eq. (52) and the forbidden region

y2 = (x2 + x + 1

2) + (x + 1

it is easy to check that the same function f appears in the derivatives of the coordinates x

and y with respect to . from eq. (70) we infer

(75)

we conclude that, if for  = 0 a root of eq. (55) exists, for  > 0 its ordinate yr(,a)
follows the boundary continuously. moreover, eq. (70) tells us that for  = 0 there are two

31

roots sitting on the x-axis (yr = 0), whose x coordinates are the solutions of the following

equation

x + 1

x

= ea(cid:16)x+

1

2(cid:17).

(76)

2 . clearly, when x approaches the value  1

one can check that eq. (76) admits only two solutions, for any value of a, symmetric with
respect to the axis x =  1
2 , the condition y2  0
in eq. (71) can be fullled only if a  4. therefore, we start at  = 0 with two roots on
the real axis which move continuously along the boundary as  increases if a > 4, whereas
for a  4 there is a critical value of , let us call it cr, for which the two roots reach the
axis x =  1
2 and then remain on it, moving in the imaginary direction. hence a gap is
originated, since

(a, ) = 0

for

  cr , a  4 .

at this stage we present an hand-waving argument to show that only one of the two roots

is encircled by the integration contour. nevertheless a rigorous proof based on a thorough

examination of eq. (53) can be given. although the region of convergence of eq. (52)

appreciably varies according to the value of a, it is always made up of disconnected pieces
and the axis x =  1
2 represents a border line between a domain of convergence and a
forbidden region. as a consequence, the integration contour, which encircles the origin of

the complex plane (lying in the forbidden region), is forced not to cross such an axis and

to capture just one of the two roots (remember they are symmetric with respect to the

exchange x  x  1). this root in turn and the origin become the two branch points of
the logarithm in eq. (54).

let us now determine the exact value of cr in case a < 4. the criticality is reached

when x =  1

2 , so that we evince from eq. (71)

then eq. (70) becomes

ycr = r 1

ycr = 1

2 cos (cr  aycr)  ycr sin (cr  aycr)
2 sin (cr  aycr) + ycr cos (cr  aycr)




eventually, by inserting the value of ycr, the solution is straightforwardly found

cr =ra  a2
