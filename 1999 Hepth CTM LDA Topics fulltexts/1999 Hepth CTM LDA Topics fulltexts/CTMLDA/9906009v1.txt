hawking radiation in string theory
and the string phase of black holes

m. ramon medrano 1 ,2 and n. sanchez 2

abstract

the quantum string emission by black holes is computed in the framework of the string
analogue model (or thermodynamical approach), which is well suited to combine qft and
string theory in curved backgrounds (particulary here, as black holes and strings posses intrinsic
thermal features and temperatures). the qft-hawking temperature th is upper bounded by
the string temperature ts in the black hole background. the black hole emission spectrum is an
incomplete gamma function of (th  ts). for th  ts, it yields the qft-hawking emission.
for th  ts, it shows highly massive string states dominate the emission and undergo a
typical string phase transition to a microscopic minimal black hole of mass mmin or radius
rmin (inversely proportional to ts) and string temperature ts.

the semiclassical qft black hole (of mass m and temperature th) and the string black
hole (of mass mmin and temperature ts) are mapped one into another by a dual transform
which links classical/qft and quantum string regimes.

the string back reaction eect (selfconsistent black hole solution of the semiclassical einstein
equations with mass m+ (radius r+) and temperature t+) is computed. both, the qft and
string black hole regimes are well dened and bounded: rmin  r+  rs , mmin  m+ 
m , th  t+  ts.

1 introduction and results

in the context of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, black holes have an intrinsic hawking
temperature ref. [1] given by

th =

hc

4kb

(d  3)

rs

rs  lcl

rs being the schwarzchilds radius (classical length lcl).

in the context of quantum string theory in curved spacetime, quantum strings in black hole

spacetimes have an intrinsic temperature given by

ts =

hc

4kb

(d  3)

lq

, lq =

bls(d  3)

, ls  s h

,

which is the same as the string temperature in at spacetime (see ref. [2] and section 3 in this paper).

the qft-hawking temperature th is a measure of the compton length of the black hole, and
thus, of its quantum size, or quantum property in the semiclassical-qft regime. the compton
length of a quantum string is a direct measure of its size lq. the string temperature ts is a measure
of the string mass, and thus inversely proportional to lq.

the r or dual transform over a length introduced in ref. [3] is given by:

under the r-operation:

and

lcl = rlcl = lq
lq = rlq = lcl

th = ts

ts = th

the qft-hawking temperature and the string temperature in the black hole background are
r-dual of each other. this is valid in all spacetime dimensions d, and is a generic feature of qft
and string theory in curved backgrounds, as we have shown this relation for the respectives qft-
hawking temperature and string temperature in de sitter space ref. [3]. in fact, the r-transform

maps qft and string domains or regimes.

in this paper, we investigate the issue of hawking radiation and the back reaction eect on the
black hole in the context of string theory. in principle, this question should be properly addressed
in the context of string field theory. on the lack of a tractable framework for it, we work here
in the framework of the string analogue model (or thermodynamical approach). this is a suitable
approach for cosmology and black holes in order to combine qft and string study and to go further
in the understanding of quantum gravity eects. the thermodynamical approach is particularly ap-
propriated and natural for black holes, as hawking radiation and the string gas [4,5] posses intrinsic
thermal features and temperatures.

in this approach, the string is a collection of elds n coupled to the curved background, and
whose masses mn are given by the degenerate string mass spectrum in the curved space considered.
each eld n appears as many times the degeneracy of the mass level (m). (althrough the elds
n do not interact among themselves, they do with the black hole background).

in black hole spacetimes, the mass spectrum of strings is the same as in at spacetime ref. [2],

therefore the higher masses string spectrum satises

(a and b being constants, depending on the model, and on the number of space dimensions).

we consider the canonical partition function (ln z) for the higher excited quantum string states
of open strings (which may be or may be not supersymmetric) in the asymptotic (at) black hole
region. the gas of strings is at thermal equilibrium with the black hole at the hawking temperature
th, it follows that the canonical partition function, [eq. (9)] is well dened for hawking temperatures
satisfying the condition

ts represents a maximal or critical value temperature. this limit implies a minimum horizon radius

we compute the thermal quantum string emission of very massive particles by a d dimensional
schwarzschild bh. this highly massive emission, corresponding to the higher states of the string
mass spectrum, is naturally expected in the last stages of bh evaporation.

in the context of qft, bh emit particles with a planckian (thermal) spectrum at temperature
th. the quantum bh emission is related to the classical absorption cross section through the
hawking formula ref. [1]:

q(k, d) =

a(k, d)

(ee(k)/kbth  1)

the classical total absorption spectrum a(k, d) ref. [6] is entirely oscillatory as a function of
the energy. this is exclusive to the black hole (other absorptive bodies do not show this property).

in the context of the string analogue model, the quantum emission by the bh is given by

string(d) = s c

h z 

m0

q(m, d) (m)dm

q(m, d) being the quantum emission for an individual quantum eld with mass m in the string
mass spectrum. m0 is the lowest mass from which the asymptotic expression for (m) is still valid.

we nd string(d) as given by [eq. (34)] (open strings). it consists of two terms: the rst term is
characteristic of a quantum thermal string regime, dominant for th close to ts; the second term, in
terms of the exponential-integral function ei is dominant for th  ts from which the qft hawking
radiation is recovered.
for th  ts (semiclassical qft regime):

, s  (tskb)1

b(d) is a precise computed coecient [eq. (34.a)].

the computed string(d) shows the following: at the rst stages, the bh emission is in the
lighter particle masses at the hawking temperature th as described by the semiclassical qft regime
(second term in [eq. (34)]. as evaporation proceeds, the temperature increases, the bh radiates
the higher massive particles in the string regime (as described by the rst term of [eq. (34)]). for
th  ts, the bh enters its quantum string regime rs  rmin, m  mmin.

that is, the bh becomes a string, in fact it is more than that, as [eq. (34)] accounts for the
[5],
back reaction eect too: the rst term is characteristic of a hagedorns type singularity ref.
and the partition function here has the same behaviour as this term. its meaning is the following:
at the late stages, the emitted bh radiation (highly massive string gas) dominates and undergoes
a carlitzs type phase transition ref. [5] at the temperature ts into a condensed nite energy state.
here such a state (almost all the energy concentrated in one object) is a microscopic (or minimal)
bh of size rmin, (mass mmin) and temperature ts.

the last stage of the bh radiation, properly taken into account by string theory, makes such a
phase transition possible. here the ts scale is in the planck energy range and the transition is to a
state of string size ls. the precise detailed description of such phase transition and such nal state
deserve investigation.

a phase transition of this kind has been considered in ref.

[7]. our results here supports and
give a precise picture to some issues of bh evaporation discussed there in terms of purely thermo-
dynamical considerations.

we also describe the (perturbative) back reaction eect in the framework of the semiclassical
einstein equations (c-number gravity coupled to quantum string matter) with the v.e.v. of the
energy momentum tensor of the quantum string emission as a source. in the context of the analogue
model, such stress tensor v.e.v. is given by:

 (r)i = r 
h 

m0 ht 
 (r, m)iq(m, d)(m)dm
r 
m0 q(m, d)(m)dm

where < t 
 (r, m) > is the v.e.v. of the qft stress tensor of individual quantum elds of mass m
in the higher excited string spectrum. the solution to the semiclassical einstein equations is given
by ([eq. (53)], [eq. (56)], [eq. (60)]) (d = 4):

the string form factor a is given by [eq. (62)], it is nite and positive. for th  ts, the back
reaction eect in the qft-hawking regime is consistently recovered. algebraic terms in (th  ts)
are enterely stringly. in both cases, the relevant ratio a/r6
s entering in the solution (r+, m+, t+) is
negligible. it is illustrative to show it in the two opposite regimes:

the string back reaction solution shows that the bh radius and mass decrease, and the bh
temperature increases, as it should be. but here the bh radius is bounded from below (by rmin and
the temperature does not blow up (as it is bounded by ts). the mass loss and time life are:

the string back reaction eect is nite and consistently describes both, the qft regime (bh of
mass m and temperature th) and the string regime (bh of mass mmin and temperature ts). both
regimes are bounded as in string theory we have:

the r dual transform well summarizes the link between the two opposite well dened regimes:
th  ts (ie rs  rmin, m  mmin) and th  ts (ie rs  rmin, m  mmin).

this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we summarize the classical bh geometry and
its semiclassical thermal properties in the qft-hawking regime. in section 3 we derive the bonds
imposed by string theory on this regime and show the dual relation between the string and hawking
temperatures. in section 4 we compute the quantum string emission by the bh. in section 5 we
compute its back reaction eect. section 6 presents conclusions and remarks.

(3.b)

the schwarzschild black hole (b.h) is characterized by its mass m (angular momentum : j = 0 ;
electric charge : q = 0). the horizon [eq. (3)] and the thermodynamical magnitudes associated to
the b.h  temperature (t ), entropy (s), and specic heat (cv )  are all expressed in terms of m
(table 1).

a brief review of these quantities is the following:

(7.b)

as it is known, [eq. (5)], [eq. (6)] and [eq. (7)] show that the b.h according to its specic
heat being negative  increases its temperature in its quantum emission process (m decreases). also,
it could seem that, if the b.h would evaporate completely (m = 0), the qft-hawking temperature
th would become innite. however, at this limit, and more precisely when m  mp l, the xed
classical background approximation for the b.h geometry breaks down, and the back reaction eect
of the radiation matter on the b.h must be taken into account.
in section 5, we will take into
account this back reaction eect in the framework of string theory.

first, we will consider quantum strings in the xed b.h background. we will see that even in this
approximation, quantum string theory not only can retard the catastrophic process but, furthermore,
provides non-zero lower bounds for the b.h mass (m) or horizon (rs), and a nite (maximal) value
for the b.h temperature th as well.

3 quantum strings in the black hole space

time

the schwarzschild black hole spacetime is asymptotically at. black hole evaporation  and any
slow down of this process  will be measured by an observer which is at this asymptotic region.
in ref.
[2] it has been found that the mass spectrum of quantum string states coincides with the
one in minkowski space. critical dimensions are the same as well ref. [2] (d = 26, open and closed
bosonic strings; d = 10 super and heterotic strings).

therefore, the asymptotic string mass density of levels in black hole spacetime will read as in

in this paper, strings in a b.h spacetime are considered in the framework of the string analogue
model. in this model, one considers the strings as a collection of quantum elds 1,   , n , whose
masses are given by the string mass spectrum ( ( c
h )m2  n , for open strings and large n in at
spacetime). each eld of mass m appears as many times as the degeneracy of the mass level ; for
higher excited modes this is described by (m) [eq. (8)]. although quantum elds do not interact
among themselves, they do with the b.h background.

11

in the asymptotic (at) b.h region, the thermodynamical behavior of the higher excited quan-
tum string states of open strings, for example, is deduced from the canonical partition function ref.

the string temperature (table 2). for open bosonic strings one divides by 2 the r.h.s. of [eq. (11)]
(leading contributions are the same for bosonic and fermionic sector).

from [eq. (11)] we see that the denition of ln z implies the following condition on the hawking

temperature

th < ts

(13)

furthermore, as th depends on the b.h mass m, or on the horizon rs , [eq. (5.a)], [eq. (5.b)]
and [eq. (3)], the above condition will lead to further conditions on the horizon. then ts represents
a critical value temperature: ts  tcr. in order to see this more clearly, we rewrite ts in terms of
the quantum string length scale

namely

(14)

(15)

(16)

which shows that (rst quantized) string theory provides a lower bound, or minimum radius, for
the b.h horizon.

m >

it is appropriate, at this point, to make use of the r or dual transformation over a length

introduced in ref. [3]. this operation is

lcl = rlcl = lrl1

cl = lq

and

lq = rlq = lrl1

q = lcl

(20.a)

where lr has dimensions of (lenght)2; and it is given by lr = lcllq.

in our case, lcl is the classical schwarzschild radius, and lq  rmin = (b(d3)ls )/4 [eq. (16)].
the r transformation links classical lengths to quantum string lenghts, and more generally it

links qft and string theory domains ref. [3].

and the string temperature is

the bh background are mapped one into another. this appears to be a general feature for qft

background ref. [3].

4 thermal quantum string emission for a

schwarzschild black hole

as it is known, thermal emission of massless particles by a black hole has been considered in the
[10]. here, we are going to deal with thermal emission of
context of qft ref.
high massive particles which correspond to the higher excited modes of a string. the study will be
done in the framework of the string analogue model.

[1], ref.

[9], ref.

15

for a static d dimensional black hole, the quantum emission cross section q(k, d) is related

to the total classical absorption cross section a(k, d) through the hawking formula ref. [1]

q(k, d) =

a(k, d)
ee(k)h  1

(21)

where e(k) is the energy of the particle (of momentum : p = h k) and h = (kbth)1, being th
hawking temperature [eq. (5.a)] and [eq. (5.b)].

the total absorption cross section a(k, d) in [eq. (21)] has two terms ref. [6], one is an isotropic
k independent part, and the other has an oscillatory behavior, as a function of k, around the optical
geometric constant value with decreasing amplitude and constant period. here we will consider only
the isotropic term, which is the more relevant in our case.

for a d dimensional black hole space-time, this is given by (see for example ref.[2])

a(k, d) = a(d) rd2

s

where rs is the horizon [eq. (3.a)] and [eq. (4)] and

we notice that (m) [eq. (8)] depends only on the mass, therefore we could consider, in our
formalism, the emitted high mass spectrum as spinless. on the other hand, as we are dealing with a
schwarzschild black hole (angular momentum equal to zero), spin considerations can be overlooked.
emission is larger for spinless particles ref. [11].

the number of scalar eld particles of mass m emitted per unit time is

hn(m)i = z

where d(k) is the number of states between k and k + dk.

5 quantum string back reaction in black

hole space times

when we consider quantised matter on a classical background, the dynamics can be described by

the following einstein equations

r
 

1
2


r =

8g

c4

h 
i

(35)

the space-time metric g generates a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum
tensor h 
i, which in turn, acting as a source, modies the former background. this is the so-called
back reaction problem, which is a semiclassical approach to the interaction between gravity and
matter.

our aim here is to study the back reaction eect of higher massive (open) string modes (described
by (m) , [eq. (8)]) in black holes space-times. this will give us an insight on the last stage of black
hole evaporation. back reaction eects of massless quantum elds in these equations were already
investigated ref. [12], ref. [13], ref. [14].

as we are also interested in stablishing the dierences, and partial analogies, between string the-
ory and the usual quantum eld theory for the back reaction eects in black holes space-times, we
will consider a 4 dimensional physical black hole.

the question now is how to write the appropriate energy-momentum tensor h 

i for these higher
excited string modes. for this purpose, we will consider the framework of the string analogue model.
in the spirit of this model, the v.e.v. of the stress tensor h 
i for the string higher excited modes is
dened by

 (r)i = r 
h 

m0 ht 
 (r, m)i hn(m)i(m) dm
r 
m0 hn(m)i(m) dm
where ht 
 (r, m)i is the hartle-hawking vacuum expectation value of the stress tensor of an indi-
vidual quantum eld, and the r dependence of ht 
i preserves the central gravitational character of
the problem ; (m) is the string mass density of levels [eq. (8)] and hn(m)i is the number of eld
particles of mass m emitted per unit time, [eq. (28)].

model, we notice that (m) [eq. (8)] depends only on m ; therefore, we will consider for simplicity

6 conclusions

we have suitably combined qft and quantum string theory in the black hole background in the
framework of the string analogue model (or thermodynamical approach).

we have computed the quantum string emission by a black hole and the back reaction eect
on the black hole in the framework of this model. a clear and precise picture of the black hole
evaporation emerges.

the qft semiclassical regime and the quantum string regime of black holes have been identied

and described.

the hawking temperature th is the intrinsic black hole temperature in the qft semiclassical
regime. the intrinsic string temperature ts is the black hole temperature in the quantum string
regime. the two regimes are mapped one into another by the r - dual transform.

string theory properly describes black hole evaporation: because of the emission, the semiclassical
bh becomes a string state (the minimal bh), and the emitted string gas becomes a condensed
microscopic state (the minimal bh) due to a phase transition. the last stage of the radiation in
string theory, makes such a transition possible.

the phase transition undergone by the string gas at the critical temperature ts represents (in

the thermodynamical framework) the back reaction eect of the string emission on the bh.

the r - dual relationship between qft black holes and quantum strings revealed itself very
interesting. it appears here this should be promoted to a dynamical operation: evolution from clas-
sical to quantum (and conversely).

30

cosmological evolution goes from a quantum string phase to a qft and classical phase. black
hole evaporation goes from a qft semiclassical phase to a string phase. the hawking temperature,
which we know as the black hole temperature, becomes the string temperature for the string black
hole.
