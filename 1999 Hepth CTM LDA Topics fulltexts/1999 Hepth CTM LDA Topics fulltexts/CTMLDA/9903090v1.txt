abstract

we study ve dimensional non critical type 0 string theory and its
correspondence to non supersymmetric yang mills theory in four di-
mensions. we solve the equations of motion of the low energy eective
action and identify a class of solutions that translates into a conning
behavior in the ir region of the dual gauge theories.
in particular
we identify a setup which is dual to pure su (n ) yang-mills theory.
possible ows of the solutions to the uv region are discussed. the
validity of the solutions and potential sub-leading string corrections
are also discussed.

1 introduction

it is well known that the original motivation behind string theory was the
search for the theory of the strong interactions. in spite of the fact that string
theory drifted to a very dierent domain, the original quest of a stringy
description of yang mills theory is still an important challenge.

a step forward in this direction was made by polyakov who argued [1, 2]
that this string theory is associated with a liouville theory with a curved
fth dimension. recently, the seminal work of maldacena[3] followed by
[4] and [5] invoked a dramatic breakthrough in the interplay between string
theory and supersymmetric conformal gauge theory in the large n limit. a
natural question that has been raised following this development is whether
similar insight from gravity and string theory can be also achieved about
non-conformal and non-supersymmetric four dimensional gauge theories. in
particular whether one can merge the ideas of polyakov with those of the
string/gauge duality.

indeed this question attracted recently a lot of attention mainly along
the direction of a critical type 0 string theory [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], but
also in a non-critical setting [14, 15]. a key point in the implementation of a
consistent bosonic string theory is rendering the tachyon eld into a good
tachyon, namely, shifting the value of m2 to a positive one. klebanov and
tseytlin [6] showed that in the background of d-branes, the coupling of the
tachyon to the r-r ux can remove the tachyon instability. next it was
shown [7, 8] that the uv behavior of asymptotically free gauge theories can
be extracted from the gravity description of the theories. the infra-red
behavior of these theories was rst considered in [8], where the ir xed
point of 4d yang-mills with 6 massless adjoint scalars was identied as the
asymptotically ads5  s5 metric. it was then argued [12] that the adjoint
scalars would acquire mass through loop corrections and that the generic
behavior, in the ir, is that of a pure yang-mills theory. accordingly, a
conning solution of the gravity equations of motion was found. another
interesting result was the identication of a large n non-supersymmetric
cft[10]. the theory is a su(n)su(n) gauge theory with 6 adjoint scalars
and 4 bifundamental weyl fermions in the ( n, n)  (n, n) representation.
in this paper we follow the direction paved by polyakov and discuss non-
critical type 0 string theory in ve dimensions. the analysis of the non
critical theory faces more problems than the critical one, however, it has the

1

advantage that it does not include degrees of freedoms which are associated
with the extra dimensions. hence it is more closely related to the pure
ym theory. our main result is that there are solutions to the equations of
motion, derived from the eective action, that correspond to connement in
the dual gauge theory. the notion of connement here means that a wilson
loop deduced from a nambu goto action in the background of the metric
solution admits an area law behavior. the solutions have non-zero measure
in the space of solutions, though other solutions also exist. we also derive
ows of the solutions that corresponds to the uv behavior of the gauge
theory. we nd two possible scenarios: (i) solutions that are connected to an
ads5 solution which corresponds to a uv xed point. (ii) solutions in which
the eective gauge coupling is asymptotically free. unfortunately, since the
analysis is based on numerical integration of dierential equations, we are
not able to extract the  function from the uv behavior of the wilson loop.
in the absence of at directions we believe the solutions are associated with
gauge theories that do not include (adjoint) scalars and hence those gauge
theories are in a conning phase. specically, 5d type 0 string theory in the
background of n d3 electric branes is conjectured to be dual to pure 4d
yang-mills theory[2]. we also nd certain evidence for a non critical analog
(with no scalars and one bifundamental fermion) of the su(n)  su(n)
gauge theory of [10]. the coupling of the tachyon to the r-r forms, which in
this case is symmetric under t  t , leads to a conning solution evolving
to the uv with a vanishing tachyon.
beyond the extraction of solutions admitting gauge dynamics, the pur-
pose of our work is to identify the conditions required to assure the reliability
of the solutions. we discuss the tadpole cancelation, the shift of the tachy-
onic instability, the consistency of the non-critical string, higher order string
perturbations, curvature corrections and the stability of the stack of n d3
branes.

the outline of the paper is as follows. we consider the degrees of freedom
of the non critical type 0 theory in ve dimensions and review its low energy
eective action and the corresponding equations of motion in section 2. in
section 3 we derive solutions to those equations. an exact ads5 solution,
generic conning solutions and their ows to the uv region. in section 4 we
discuss the conditions for the validity of the solutions. section 5 is devoted
to the eld theory interpretation of the gravity solutions. this is addressed
via the symmetries of the boundary theory, the gauge coupling, eld content,

2

wilson loop, t hooft loop and zig zag invariance. the result of this work
are summarized in section 6.
in the appendix we discuss the asymptotic
behavior of the solutions.

2 non-critical type 0 string theory

let us start with the identication of the low energy degrees of freedom,
namely, the massless (and tachyonic) states of the 5d type 0 string. the
degrees of freedom in the bulk come from the close string sectors.

in the 5d non-critical string theory, the degrees of freedom are in the
so(3) representation. from the (ns, ns) sector we get 0 0 = 0 which
is the tachyon t . from the (ns+, ns+) sector we get 1  1 = 2  1  0
which are the graviton gmn, the anti-symmetric tensor bmn and the dilaton
. the r sector vacuum is in the 1
2 representation of spin(3)  su(2).
from the (r, r) sector we get 1
2 = 1 + 0, namely a 0 and a 1 forms. the
1- form of the (r, r) sector is associated with the 2-form eld strength of the
d0 brane. the 0-form associated with a 1-form eld strength of the d  1
brane. by dualizing the (p + 2) eld strength of the dp brane we can get the
5  (p + 2) = (q + 2) eld strength of the dq = d(1  p) brane. this gives
us the d1 and the d2 branes. we cannot get the d3 branes directly from
the r-r sector. similar thing happens in 10d string theory where one cannot
get the d8 branes from the r-r sector. we assume that the d3 branes exist
because we can get them from d2 branes using t-duality.

2  1

the diagonal gso projection in the critical string includes the states
(r+, r) (r, r+) in type 0a and (r+, r+) (r, r) in type 0b. in
the 5d non-critical string there is no chirality and hence one cannot assign
+, to the ramond ground state. the diagonal gso projection, does not
determine the multiplicity of the (r, r) sector. however, from the require-
ment of modular invariance of the torus partition function, we believe that
the (r,r) sector has to be doubled. assuming there is doubling of the r-r
sector we would have two sets of d-branes, electric and magnetic.

the low energy type 0 eective action built from the (ns, ns) and (r,r)
sectors was derived in [6] for any dimension, both critical and non-critical.
we briey summarize its features using their notations. the supergravity

coupling of the tachyon to the r-r eld.

where x are the coordinates of an n dimensional at minkowski space and k
is a k dimensional sphere. the string theory is in d = n + k + 1 dimensions.
cn is a n-form with all the indices in the minkowski space, and fn+1 is a
(n + 1)-form where the extra index is in the  direction. we also assume for
the tachyon that t = t ( ).

dening the function   2 n k and plugging the metric into the

string actions we obtain

for the set of electric-magnetic d3 branes, when the electric and magnetic

charges are the same we get [10]

h(t ) = f (t ) + f 1(t ) .

(20)

note that the ir behavior of the dual gauge theory is dictated by the
behavior of 4
3(  ) = 2 which appears in the four dimensional space-time
part of the metric (11). from the wilson loop calculations we know that if
 has a unique minimum at a certain value of  then the theory will conne.
therefore it is useful to write the metric, the hamiltonian and the equations
of motions in terms of  and . the metric is

the charge of the r-r eld is proportional to the number of branes q 
n. it is convenient to absorb this factor by the redenition  =   ln n,
 =   1
2 ln n. this redenition xes the n dependence in the metric
(21). the 4d space-time part is multiplied by 1
n . also, the curvature in the
string frame does not depend on n. the einstein frame in 5d in dened by
ds2 = e

solutions of the equations of motion

in this section we derive congurations of the metric, dilaton and tachyon
that solve the equations of motion, and as will be discussed in section 5
incorporate interesting gauge theory interpretation. we nd an exact ads5

6

solution.
in addition we write down solutions which later will be argued
to describe the ir regime of the corresponding gauge theories and we use
numerical analysis to ow to the uv regime.

we discuss both the electric branes system as well as the electric-magnetic
system [6, 10]. the later is somewhat simpler since in this case t = 0 is a
solution of the tachyon equation of motion (25). this is a consequence of
the symmetry t  t in h(t ) which results from the electric-magnetic
symmetry of the problem.

3.1 the ads5 solution

an exact solution to (14) (15) and (16) can be found for a general function
h(t ) by taking  and t to be constants, and solving the algebraic equations

this solution, which has already appeared in [2], may seem to have a very

dierent curvature than that of the ads5  s5 [3] r  gsn . in fact it
is of the same nature since en  1. also note that weak string coupling
occurs for large n.

3.2 conning solutions

conning gauge theories are characterized in the gravity description by a
unique minimum of the 4d space-time of the metric (11)[17]. we will elabo-
rate on the gauge theory in section 5.

we would like to show now that the system of equations (22)-(25) admits

solutions with a minimum.

assuming h(t ) is a positive function, we nd using eq.(24) that

 > 0

(34)

hence  is monotonically increasing. let us assume boundary conditions such
that for small values of ,  is negative. therefore there are two possibilities:
(i)  is negative for all . (ii)  = 0 at some point.

a solution in which condition ii.

is satised implies connement. the
reason is that if ( = 0) = 0, it is a minimum of e2 and it is guaranteed
that it is a unique minimum. we demonstrate that such solutions exist.
moreover, we argue that these solutions are generic.

we nd the solutions to the equations of motions by expanding in power

series around the minimum of , assuming  has a minimum

() = 
n=0
() = 
n=0
t () = 

n(  0)n ,
n(  0)n ,
n=0tn(  0)n .

in order to have a minimum of  at  = 0 we set 1 = 0. from the zero

energy constraint we get

1 =

t0(cid:19) .

evidently 2 > 0 and hence the solution corresponds to a minimum.

there are ve free parameters in the solution: 0, 0, t0, t1 and 0. from
(35) we see that some of the parameter space is excluded by the requirement
of a real dilaton. we can go on and compute higher corrections in (  0).
from the equation of motion one can see that the n+2, n+2, tn+2 coecients
depend on the i, i, ti (i  n) coecients, meaning that this process can
go on indenitely.
since the above solutions admit connement, it is important to under-
stand that it is not an accidental feature of the solutions. the three equations
of motion have six boundary conditions. one parameter is decreased by the
zero energy constraint. another one drops out because the hamiltonian does
not depend explicitly on time and therefore if {(), ()} is a solution
then {( + ), ( + )} is also a solution. therefore the physical space of
solutions is four dimensional. our solution has four free parameters 0, 0, t0
and t1 and accordingly has a non-zero measure in the space of solutions.

the wilson loop analysis tells us that for large enough quark anti-quark
distance l the string spends most of its time near the minimum of  which
corresponds to the ir regime. the question now is how to extrapolate the
solutions of above to the region along the  direction that corresponds in the
gauge picture to the uv regime.

3.3 the ow to the uv limit

to analyze the uv limit we need to continue the solution from the minimum
to the 4d boundary of the 5d space. lets analyze the solution we found for
the case of the electric magnetic branes, h(t ) = et + et . for this function
we choose the solutions with t = 0 to make the analysis easier, though we
found, numerically, similar behavior in the electric case also. now we have

9

only two free parameters 0, 0 and the solution looks like

1 = +
2 =  1
2 = 1

8re4 0+80 (cid:16)5  2e2 0(cid:17)

2 e4 0+80

(37)

(38)

(39)

the choice of sign in 1 is arbitrary. changing the sign would give a mirror
solution   . from (37) we get a constraint on the value of the dilaton
in the minimum of 

e2 0 

5
2

.

(40)

numerical analysis of the equations of motion shows us that there are three
possible types of behavior for the dilaton, depending on the choice of param-
eters 0, 0. if we start with a large 0 (e2 0 close to 5
2), then the dilaton
would go to innity for  < 0. on the other hand, if we start with a small
0, then the dilaton would go to minus innity. between those two regions
in the two dimensional parameter space there is a border line, at the value
e 0  1.52, in which the dilaton e  ows to 1 (see gure 1). this set of
solutions with the nely tuned parameters ows to the ads5 solution (32).
for the ads5 solution we know that the boundary is at  = 0 and  = 1
u4 .
therefore we interpret small values of  as large values of energy.

we can compute corrections to the exact ads5 solution and connect them
to the solution around the minimum. if we plug  from (30) to the dilaton
equation and assume that the dilaton is small (e   1 + ) we get

which is solved by

42  + 5  = 0 ,

 = c

1+6

2

,

(41)

(42)

for any constant c. by xing the value of c we get a  behavior which is
very close to the bold line in gure 1 for small . note that since   0,
g2
y m n  1, we have a uv xed point at nite value of the t hooft coupling.

10

in order to get asymptotic freedom we need to start with lower values
of e2 0 in the minimum. numerical analysis show that those solutions ow
toward e2   0 in the uv limit. at the moment we do not know the
analytical behavior of  and . and therefore we can not extract the 
function.

kinds of solutions of the dilaton as a function of . the three possibilities

solution), which corresponds to a uv xed point and iii.    in the
uv which describes asymptotic freedom. the behavior at  = 0 is dictated
by the value of  at the minimum of  which we draw at  = 1.

4 validity of the solutions

the solutions of the eective type 0 equations of motion can be trusted only
if certain conditions are obeyed. basically one has to check that the string
theory, that leads to the low energy eective action whose classical congura-
tions we discuss, is consistent. in addition, higher order string perturbations
and sub-leading  corrections should be under control. on top of these con-
ditions one has to check whether the correspondence to a dual gauge theory
on the boundary in the spirit of the ads/cft correspondence is consistent.
we discuss here the former question and the later will be addressed in section
5.

11

 the type 0 non critical string theory is consistent only provided that
the torus partition function is modular invariant and that tadpole of
the massless elds are canceled out. the critical type 0 string theory,
namely the theory derived using a diagonal gso projection, was shown
to be modular invariant. we have not performed an explicit computa-
tion in the present non-critical theory. however it seems that the same
structure of a modular invariant partition function holds also for our
case. [16]. modular invariance was argued also in [2]

in the type 0 theory there are potentially tachyon and dilaton tadpoles.
the critical type 0 theory discussed in [6] as well as the non-critical
one [2] are free from dilaton tadpoles. this is a statement about the
leading behavior of the string theory. in fact one has also to assure
that dilaton tadpoles are not generated even in the sub-leading string
corrections[18]. at present it is not clear to us whether the type 0
models obey this stronger condition.

 another necessary condition for the consistency of the non-critical
in
string theory is that the tachyon t looses its tachyonic nature.
an ads background of radius r the requirement is that m2
t  4/r2.
for the cft that is associated with the critical dyonic type 0 theory
[10] the condition takes the form 4+16f 2(0)  2qe/2 where  is the

value of the dilaton for that model. in the present case, since we have a
non ads background, we take the more conservative requirement that
m2
t  0. using (16) this translates into

e2  

3

8h(t )

,

(43)

which is obeyed by the solutions that ow to the ads5. note that one
has to require the positivity of m2
t everywhere along the  coordinate
and not only on the surface of the the ve dimensional space. therefore,
the solutions with asymptotic freedom (small dilaton) do not obey this
condition. a solution with asymptotic freedom can be stable with a
non constant tachyon if h(t ) converges in the uv.

 non critical string theory is believed to be inconsistent for c > 1 and
c < ccrit. our analysis is focused on d = c = 4. the obvious question is

12

whether one can make sense out of such a setup. polyakov [2] conjec-
tured that for non at d + 1 dimensions, namely d at directions and
one liouville direction, the instability of the theory may be cured in
the presence of non zero r-r background. we argued above, following
[6], that the mass of the tachyon can be shifted so that mt ef f > 0 due
to the coupling with the r-r eld even in the non-critical dimension
of d = 4. since the instability of the theories at the forbidden zone
past the c = 1 barrier, manifest itself in the tachyonic behavior, the
shift of m2
t may render the theory at d = 4 into a consistent one. it
is important to assure that even sub-leading string correction do not
introduce other tachyonic modes by shifting the masses of massless or
massive modes to tachyonic ones [18].

 the solutions of the equations of motion are reliable only provided that
the modications of the eective action due to higher order string loop
corrections are negligible. for that, one has to insure that the string
n e  is weak. indeed, the conning solutions which obey
coupling e = 1
(40) and have large enough n, satisfy this condition.

 the gravitational sector of the low energy eective eld theory (6) is a
valid approximation to the full gravitational eective action only pro-
vided that higher order curvature terms are negligible. as was argued
in [6] the world sheet supersymmetry, even in the absence of space-time
supersymmetry restricts the corrections to the type 0 eective action
to be identical to those of the type ii. in the gravitational sector the
rst corrections are proportional to 3r4, and only the weyl tensor
contributes to the r4 term. it turns out that the ve dimensional met-
ric of the general form (11), not necessarily of an ads5 form, has a
vanishing weyl tensor so that the rst order correction vanishes. since
the full list of higher order curvature corrections is not known to us, to
be on the safe side, we would like to impose a restriction that the ricci
scalar is small in the string frame.

the curvature (in the string frame) associated with the solution (35)
(36) is given, near the minimum, by

r = 8e2 0 + o(  0)

(44)

13

hence, for small 0 we are guaranteed not to have signicant modi-
cations to the gravitational eective action. unfortunately, a small
0 is restricted by the requirement for a stable tachyon (43). we be-
lieve that this contradiction appears because both conditions are too
strict. the condition for the small ricci scalar is too strict because it
seems that the rst higher order curvature corrections depend only on
the vanishing weyl tensor. the condition for the stable tachyon is too
strong because we did not take into account the fact that the metric
has a negative curvature that helps stabilize the tachyon.

 the stability of the stack of n d3 branes. since there is no space-time
supersymmetry the d branes are not bps states and there is a-priori no
reason that there is no force between them. recently, stable non-bps
states where studied in various setups [19]. even though we believe
that the two phenomena may be related the direct implications of [19]
to the present case are still unclear to us. note that the bosonic degrees
of freedom of the type 0 are identical to those of the type ii apart from
the fact that in the former case there is a doublet of r-r elds. the
computation of the interaction energy between two parallel d3 branes
was presented in [6] for the case of a single type of d3 branes and
for electric-magnetic branes. it seems that the same features show up
also in the non-critical type 0 string. it is therefore our believe that
there might be stable stacks of n electric (or magnetic) d3 brane as
well as electric-magnetic stacks of branes. recall that the stability at
the level of subleading string corrections relates to the issue of possible
generation of dilaton tadpole [18].

in fact the stability in the non-critical case may be in a better shape
than the stability in the critical case, because in the later case there are
at directions [11, 13]. the 5d non-critical theory has only the liouville
direction perpendicular to the branes, so there are no at direction in
the rst place. in the language of the gauge elds this translates into
the fact that there are no (adjoint) scalar elds and thus the su(n)
gauge symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken.

14

5 the gauge theory interpretation

now that solutions of the equations of motion were written down and their
validity was considered, we face the challenge of deducing the interpretation
of the solutions in terms of the four dimensional boundary gauge theory.
obviously, in the present non supersymmetric and non conformal scenario it
is more dicult to argue in favor of the duality between the the supergravity
solution and the gauge theory on the boundary. nevertheless, we try to
analyze the gauge interpretation following the recipe of the ads5  s5 and
the n = 4 sym correspondence.

5.1

symmetries

 the bulk space-time eective theory of the type 0 string is not invariant
under any supersymmetry transformation, therefore the dual gauge
theory should also be a non-supersymmetric one.

 the electric solution and the electric-magnetic solution incorporate n
electric and n electric and n magnetic non bps d3 branes respec-
tively. it is well known that the open strings between the coinciding
d3 branes (of the same type) induce su(n) gauge elds. hence the
electric theory and the electric-magnetic theories should be invariant
under local su(n) and su(n)  su(n) symmetries respectively.

 global symmetries of the boundary theory originate from isometries of
the 5d space-time metric (which are in addition to the 3+1 dimensional
poincare symmetry). the conning solutions do not admit any sym-
metries. the ads5 has an so(2, 4) isometry group which maps into
the symmetries of the four dimensional conformal gauge theory.

5.2 gauge coupling

in the absence of a tachyon eld in the vacuum, the eective gauge theory
on the d3 brane has the form of et r[f 2] so that the gauge coupling is
expected to be g2
y m  e. it was put forward that this relation translates
the evolution of the coupling constant as a function of the energy scale into
the dependence of  on the fth dimension. in case that the tachyon is non
vanishing in the ground state, the gauge coupling is dressed e  f (t )e.

15

since one can introduce a transformation of the fth coordinate, an non
ambiguous result can be derived from a physical measurement like the
wilson line discussed below. unfortunately, the two prescriptions are in
conict in the critical type 0 theory[9]. moreover, it happens in the present
case even when the tachyon is zero.

in the uv regime, where the expected behavior of the potential is g2

,
one can read the relation between the gauge coupling and the dilaton. in the
2 . in the present case it
case of critical strings the relation was g2
3 . we will comment about it when we will discuss the wilson

loop.

field content

 the full set of elds on the world volume of d branes is determined usu-
ally by the vector elds generated by the open strings, the scalar elds
associated with transverse free motions of the brane and the amount
of supersymmetries. in the present non critical type 0 theory super-
symmetry does not enforce additional elds in the adjoint representa-
tion. moreover the liouville direction is not a free direction and thus
a massless scalar eld cannot be associated with the motion along this
direction. we therefore conclude that the electric theory does not in-
clude any elds apart from the gauge elds, namely, it is a pure yang
mills theory.
in terms of its symmetries, the conning solution and
its ow to the uv is compatible with such a gauge scenario. on the
other hand the exact ads5 solution dictates a conformal gauge theory.
this clearly cannot be associate with the quantum yang mills theory.
classically, the theory is conformal invariant but clearly this is not a
property of the full quantum theory. at present we do not know how
to resolve this puzzle. in [2] it is argued that the ads5 solution may
be associated with a uv xed point. but since it seems to be an exact
solution for the whole range of  this conjecture is not justied.

 the situation in the electric-magnetic theory is dierent. as was shown
in [20] the open strings between the electric and magnetic d branes
constitute a matter eld on the world volume in the (n, n)  ( n , n)
representation. unlike the conformal models of [10] where the global
symmetry enforced a multiplicity of four such representations, in the

16

present case since there is no so(6) global symmetry, there is only one
such matter eld representation. the action which includes those elds
should not be invariant under any additional global symmetry.

5.4 the wilson loop

a very important tool to translate the super gravity solution into the gauge
eld language is the computation of the wilson loop introduced in [21, 22].
by now the wilson loop and similar objects were computed in various setups,
[23, 24]. in particular in [17] a necessary condition for a conning behavior
was derived. we dene the functions

f 2(u)  gtt(u)gxx(u)
g2(u)  gtt(u)guu(u)

(where u is the fth coordinate) in terms of which the nambu goto action
for the fundamental string takes the form

sf 1 = z d2h = t z dqf 2(u) + g2(u) (xu)2

(45)

then the condition for connement is that f admits a minimum and the
corresponding string tension is  = f (umin). the setup behind this nambu-
goto action is such that the quark anti-quark pair are situated at u  
and the string connecting them stretches in the domain of  > u  umin. in
the coordinate assignment of section 2(11) the boundary where the external
charges are put is at  = 0. note also that in the solutions discussed in
section 2, f = e2.

in the ads5 solution one nds that the quark anti-quark potential takes

the form e = c/l where c is a numerical factor.

for the ads5 xed point of (42) we are unable to calculate the exact
wilson loop for this metric but we can follow the approximation done in [7]
and assuming e

 is  independent for small . then we get

matching this result to that in the neighborhood of a uv xed point of
one can read the relation between the

y m n

running gauge coupling and the dilaton.

l

17

this is a manifestation of polyakovs suggestion that the ads5 solution

describes only the extreme uv behavior of the gauge theory [2].

two remarks are in order, (i) the relation between the dilaton and g2

y m
does not agree with the basic relation e  g2
y m that follows from the open
string origin of the gauge elds. (ii) it is amusing that for a non-critical theory
in 6 dimensions one does nd agreement between the naive assignment and
the one that follows from the wilson loop.

in the case of asymptotically free solutions, it is very dicult to extract
the the exact behavior of the gauge coupling. the reason is that the metric
in this region is found by numerical integration. in principle, this is enough
to calculate the wilson loop. practically, it is almost hopeless. for the de-
termination of the behavior in this regime, we will need analytical solutions,
which are not at hand at the moment.

next we address the wilson loop in the ir regime. though our solution
(35) (36) is valid at a limited region in the interior of the interval  = [0,),
the ir behavior is determined by this regime of the solution.
in particular, the space-time 4d part of the metric (11) admits a minimum

at some point  = 0. as a result [17] a conning potential exists

with the following string tension

v = r,

  min

(48)

it is important to note that since the minimum of  is unique, it is
guaranteed that higher order corrections wouldnt spoil the conning nature
of the solution.

note that though it seems that the string tension behaves as (48) 1

5.5 the t hooft loop

connement of quarks should be followed by screening of magnetic monopoles.
we would like to check whether our conning solutions obey this property.
we use the recipe of refs.[23, 24].

18

the monopole anti-monopole potential is given by the d1 action

sd1 = z d2eh = t z deqf 2(u) + g2(u) (xu)2

(49)

thus the question of screening versus connement in this case depends
on the behavior of ef = e+2. though we cant prove that magnetic
connement is excluded, the numerical behavior of  and  tells that for
quark conning solutions which ow to uv xed point or to uv free behavior,
we do have magnetic screening.

5.6

zig zag invariance

polyakov [2] stated the invariance of the wilson loop under the zig zag
transformation as a necessary condition for any string theory description of
a gauge theory. the condition translates to the following requirement on the
metric

e() = 0 or 

(50)

where  is the value of  at the boundary eld theory. this condition
follows from the fact that the solutions found for  and  do not extrimize
the boundary term in the eective action[2] and thus the d3 branes are
driven to either  = 0 or  = . polyakov further advocated the option of
e() =  for which massive boundary states vanish, and the momentum of
massless ones is not restricted. the only massless states should be the gauge
elds. as argued in 5.3 indeed there are no additional massless scalar elds
on the boundary and in the electric case no additional elds at all.

the ads5 solutions, both the exact (section 3.1) and the uv xed point
(section 3.3), obey this condition since for those cases   . the ow of
the conning solution to a solution with an asymptotic freedom does not
obey this condition since e is a constant.

6 summary and discussion

whereas the duality between 4d sym in the large n limit and the string
theory on an ads5  s5 background is by now well established, there are
only rst hints that a similar correspondence may be applicable also to the
pure ym theory. moreover, it seems now that the more promising avenue to

19

construct a string theory of strong interaction is via a gauge/gravity duality.
our work is aimed at improving the understanding of this approach.

motivated by the required form of the space time metric that yields con-
ning wilson loop [17] we searched for solutions of the equations of motion
for which  has a minimum. a class of such solutions was identied. we
showed also that the solution around the region of the minimum is smoothly
connected to the region of small values of  and found that in the region of
small e2 0,   . therefore, the corresponding gauge theories are uv
free.
it is interesting to check whether the ow towards the uv is logarithmic
as a function of the energy scale. while in other similar cases [7, 8, 12] it was
shown that this is indeed the case, we havent nd such analytical solutions
in the present case. nevertheless, the numerical study does not exclude
such a possibility. the analysis was performed in the electric-magnetic
theory only, where t = 0. it is important to analyze the uv regime in the
electric theory which describes pure yang-mills. we postpone these issues
for the future. another interesting direction is to extract the glueballs mass
spectrum and to compare it to lattice results. for this one has to know the
full behavior of the metric.

a point that was not emphasized enough in the study of the type 0 string
is that the large n limit seems to be dierent then the one implemented
in the original duality of maldacena [3]. to guarantee the consistency of
the solutions, namely small string coupling and small curvature large n
was useful but not large gsn.
in fact we found that what was needed is
gsn > 3/16 to guarantee the removal of the tachyonic behavior and gsn < 1
to assure small scalar curvature in the string frame.

on the route to the solutions several assumptions were made which de-
serves further justication. in particular an explicit computation of the torus
partition function has to be performed so that modular invariance could be
checked. additional checks about possible generation of tadpoles of massless
particles due to sub leading correction are also needed.

an interesting issue which has not been investigated thoroughly enough
is the relation between the type 0 d branes that were used in the present
work (and also in the studies made in the critical setting) and the the stable
non bps d branes discussed in [19]. in particular it seems to us that the
non trivial tachyon proles discovered recently [25] may play an important
role also in the string solutions that corresponds to gauge dynamics.

20

recently, several authors discussed super-gravity solutions of type iib, in
which the matter elds are massive[26, 27]. as expect from the eld theory
side, these solutions also admits connement.
it would be interesting to
compare their results to ours.

8 appendix - asymptotic behavior

while it is dicult to nd the precise behavior of the solutions at large  we
can negate some possibilities. since  is monotonically increasing, it might
approach some limit at   . we would like to show that while it is
impossible in the theory which lives on the electric-magnetic sets of branes,
there is a room for such scenario in the electric branes theory (pure yang-
mills).

let us rst assume zero tachyon solution with the following large  be-
