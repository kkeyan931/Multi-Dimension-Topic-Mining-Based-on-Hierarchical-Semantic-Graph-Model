abstract

in this paper we nd automorphic functions of coset manifolds with special kahler
geometry. we use -functions to regularize an innite product over integers which belong
to a duality-invariant lattice, this product is known to produce duality-invariant functions.
in turn these functions correspond to eisenstein series which can be understood as string
theory amplitudes that receive contributions from bps states. the ansatz is constructed
su (n)u (1) as an example but it can be generalized. automorphic
using the coset manifold
functions play an important role in the calculation of threshold corrections to gauge coupling
and other stringy phenomena. we also nd some connections between the theory of abelian
varieties and moduli spaces of calabi-yau manifolds.

1 introduction

it is known that special kahler manifolds [1, 2] play an important role in the low-energy
eective actions derived from superstrings. for example, the moduli space of of superstring
theories compactied on calabi-yau manifolds have special kahler geometry [3, 4, 5]; this
is also the type of manifold parametrized by the scalar components of vector multiplets in
n = 2 supergravity theories in four dimensions [6].

supergravity models based on the special kahler manifold

su (n)u (1) are known as
minimal models. this is because the manifolds
su (n)u (1) are the ones one gets straight-
forwardly from superspace or superconformal tensor calculus [7].
in this way this coset
provides a somehow general setting for supergravity models exhibiting special geometry.
on the other hand, this cosets are a non-compact analogous to cp n spaces with the avan-
tage of being the simplest family of special kahler manifolds [8].

su (1,n)

one expects the low-energy eective theories derived from superstrings to be duality-
invariant. any supergravity can be written in terms of only two functions, namely w and
k, of the superelds. they are known as the superpotential and the kahler potential,
respectively (in turn this potential can be written as derivatives of another function called
the pre-potential). these functions can actually be combined in one expression,

g = exp(k)|w|2.

(1)

duality transformations mix the moduli (the scalar eld components of k and w) among
themselves and leave the physics unchanged. this means that kahler potential transforms
like

k  k + holomorphic + anti  holomorphic

group, d  sp(2n,z) and, based on this fact, one can construct an ansatz to obtain duality-

under duality and therefore the superpotential should transform like w  e w, where 
is some factor of automorphy, in order to keep g invariant.
in general k can be written as
the symplectic product of two vectors (for the class of manifolds under consideration);
therefore, it is invariant under symplectic transformations up to a kahler factor which
does not aect the kahler metric. the duality group can be embedded into the symplectic

duality transformation act on the kahler potential.

invariant functions (in the case in which the moduli space has special kahler geometry). in
fact one can propose

zn,

 log i |piti + qifi|2
ti fi  tifi

g = xpi,qi
~p 6= ~0 6= ~0, and the prime over sum indicating that it is to
with ~p = {pi}, ~q = {qi} 
be carried out for orbits of some duality-invariant lattice  (we will see this later). the
ti are the moduli and, as we will see later in section 4, fi are derivatives of the prepotential
function f, fi = if. by construction this quantity has the required invariance.

(2)

;

let us re-write g of eq.(1) as

formally one has that  is innite and therefore needs to be regularized (the factor of 1/2

eg = ek |(ti)|2,

(3)

2

in front of k is irrelevant given its logarithmic form). from this expresion one obtains

(ti) = y~p,~q

(piti + qifi).

(4)

the suggested way for the regularization of this quantity is the so called zeta-function
regularization [9, 10]; this will be the object of study in this paper.

we end this section by briey discussing the threshold corrections to gauge couplings
in low-energy eective eld theories derived from superstrings [11]. first one should notice
that the formula (4) has the same form of the threshold eect function [12, 13, 14], which
describes the one-loop string corrections to the gauge coupling constant ga of the low energy
eective actions. indeed, this function has the form

t(,  ) =

1

162 ca log(cid:16)2 im( ) |( )|4(cid:17)

(5)

where ca are constants, that can be computed from the massless spectrum, and ( ) is
the dedekind -function. here, ||2 would be the analog of that function. threshold
corrections for orbifold cases are considered in reference [15].
it is understood that the one-loop correction to the gauge coupling constants have non-
holomorphic parts (for a review on the subject, see references [16, 17, 18] and references
therein). in the eective eld theory lagrangian of an n = 1 supersymmetric theory, the
fermionic terms are determined by the bosonic part [13]. apart from the condition that the
bosonic elds span a kahler manifold, the functions

fab() = (cid:16) 1

g2()(cid:17)ab 

iab()

82

(6)

must be holomorphic functions of the moduli . g and  are scalar eld-dependent gauge
coupling and vacuum angle respectively.

at tree-level in string theory these functions can be written in terms of the dilaton-axion

eld s:

fab() = kaab s ,

(7)

where k is the level of the kac-moody algebra. one-loop corrections to this formula pro-
vide a useful mechanism for breaking supersymmetry. at one-loop the renormalized gauge
couplings of the eective theory can be expressed as

a () = ka g2
g2

string +

1
162 ba log

string

m 2
2 + t(,  )

(8)

where  is the renormalization scale, g2
function of the low-energy eective theory and t is given in (5).

string  res, ba are coecients of the one-loop -
the non-holomorphicity of the renormalized gauge coupling is however not necessarily
a problem since it can interpreted as an eective coupling, a purely low-energy eect [16].
more recently a lot of work in the computation of the threshold corrections in more
realistic models has been done. in particular, there are some computations of the eective
gauge couplings in orbifolds with wilson lines done in reference [19, 20]. in these references
the threshold eect is given in terms of siegel modular forms.

recent developments show the importance of automorphic functions in other aspects of
string theory [21, 22, 23, 24] as well. in particular there has been a lot of progress in the
search for functions with the right invariances. however, most of these has been done for
toroidal compactications of the string. in this paper we attempt to calculate functions
with the right automorphy properties for the case of calabi-yau compactications.

in section 3 we present how the regularization of the innite product of eq.(4) can be
done in terms of a -function and we also construct such function in section 29. after this we
proceed to obtain, in sections 4 and 5, well known results of dixon and kaplunovski [12, 13]
for the su (1, 1)/u (1) manifold, by doing this we present our ansatz for other (more com-
plicated) cases. section 6 contains the rst of such cases, namely the su (1, 2)/u (1)su (2)
manifold. we nd that the automorphic function found has two dierent contributions, de-
pending on the solutions to a diophantine equation (90), we analyze them separately in the
next subsections and provide the -regularized result in eq.(124), this has the asymptotic
expansion (125). in section 7 we show the action of the symplectic group on the riemann
theta functions found in previous sections, this provides the mechanism by which duality
acts on the functions (in a way in which regularization should not be broken); in turn, this
gives us the interpretation of (93) as the period matrix of some super-torus, with a map
between its moduli space (an abelian variety) and the special kahler manifold.

2 the mass formula.

we can explain equation (2) in a more consistent way; not just by constructing it by hand
but by looking at the mass formula and the free energy of the particular low energy theory
under consideration [9, 25].
in eld theory one can obtain the tree-level free-energy for
bosonic eld using the path integral

z  efb = z [d] exp(m 2

) + 

(9)

where the integral should be carried our over the massive states of the theory. neglect-
ing derivative terms one can use this formula as a topological free energy of the bosonic
compactied string. in the bosonic case it will be interested in the contribution to the in-
tegral by those states in the spectrum which are due to string compactication (that carry
momentum and winding number). the path integral (9) then gives in general

f = log(det mm ).

(10)

for n = 1 supergravity for instance [26, 9, 27], the mass matrix has following form:

mij = eg/2 g1/2

i m [gmn + gmgn  gmnkg1

kl

gl] g1/2

nj

;

(11)

with the subindex i denoting

gi 

g
i

gi 

g
 i

gj
i 

g

j i

and we lower and raise index with

(g1)i

j gj

k = i
k.

4

supersymmetry is preserved when all the elds have vacuum expectation values that are
invariant under supersymmetry transformations, in particular this means that we should
have

eg/2(g1)i

j)gi = 0

for n = 1, since the expression in r.h.s is proportional to , the variation under super-
symmetry of the fermionic elds.

then we can write (11) as

(mm )ij = ek g1/2

ik

wkl (g1)

lm w mn g1/2

nj

using the form k =  log y , it one nds that [9]

det(mm ) = det |w|2
y

.

.

(12)

(13)

in the ansatz provided above it is therefore possible to read the superpotential from the
mass formula.

indeed, for the string theory case, the corresponding mass matrix has been found for

many cases, if the moduli space [9] is

m =

so(2, 2)

so(2)  so(2)

(pil)2  (pir)2 = 2z

(14)

(15)

z4 do not run over oscillator excitations

(16)

corresponding to some orbifold compactications, the lattice momenta (2, 2) is spanned
by vectors pil, pir which satisfy

which is the conjugate to the condition satised by the moduli elds. the free energy is
then given by

f = xn,n,m,m

 log |m + n t u + i(mu + nt )|2

(t + t )(u + u )

where the integers (0, 0, 0, 0) 6= (n, n, m, m) 
and satisfy a stronger condition than that of equation (15), namely the belong to the orbit
described by

(pil)2  (pir)2 = mn + mn = 0.

(17)

with this condition one has that (16) becomes the level-matching condition.

the innite sum (16), subject to the condition (17), can be found using zeta-functions

following the procedure of references [9, 28]. ferrara et. al. found that

f|reg = log (cid:16)|(t )|4|(t )|4(t + t )(u + u )(cid:17)

where (t ) is the dedekind function, dened as

(t )  e

1

12 t yn>0

[1  e2nt ].

5

(18)

(19)

however, the form of the actual calculation, is dicult to generalize to other cases. the
condition (17) is resolved in two dierent orbits: n = 0, n = 0 and n = 0, m = 0. this
decouples (16) into two separate sums (t 1 = t, t 2 = u ) ,

f (ti) =

2

xi=1 x(n,m)6=(0,0)

log

mi + init i
(t i + t i)

(20)

whose solution is (18). we will do this calculation later in this paper using a dierent
approach to that of reference [9].

the mass formula for other moduli spaces is also known to be of the form (2). for
su (2)u (1) ,

example, in references [29, 25] it is shown that, for a moduli space isomorphic to
the chiral mass formula is of the form

su (1,2)

z) satisfy the level matching condition

m 2 = 2 |ma  n + p|2

(21)

where ,a are the two complex moduli and the gaussian integers m, n, p (integers of the
form a + ib with a, b 

|m|2  |n|2  |p|2 = 0.

(22)

for (21).

in [29] a solution is proposed for the automorphic function of

this constraint is not easy to solve and therefore makes it dicult to nd a regularization
su (n)u (1) by
so(2)so(4) coset. the sums are carried out in orbits of the sublattice p of
truncating a
the e8  e8 lattice 16. the orbits considered not only obey the level matching condition
but also severely restrict the numbers over which the sum takes place.

we briey introduce the powerful mechanism of zeta-function regularization [30]. first
consider a simple example [31, 32] in eld theory in which -functions are use to nd

with the boundary condition g(x, y, 0) = (x  y). we construct the heat function g given
as

it can easily be veried that g solves (25). the associated -function can expressed as

(s) =

dt ts1z dpx g(x, x, t).

(27)

this analytic form of the -function can then be used to compute a regularized determinant
of the operator .

3.1 regularization of the automorphic function.

with all this in mind, we can propose as an ansatz for the regularization of the innite
product (4), via the limit formula

log i |piti + qifi|2
(ti fi  tifi)

exp (cid:16)  i (ti fi  tifi)(cid:17)i ;

(29)

the sums are taken over the orbits l in the sublattice spanned by the momentum and
winding numbers, not considering oscillator excitations.

the integers (q, p) obey constraints similar to those of equations (17,22), specialized for
the particular example of the special manifold under consideration. they transform as a
vector under the symplectic group of which the duality group is a subgroup. this is easily
seen since we can write the numerator of g as

1
1 0 (cid:19)(cid:18) ~t
since (t,f) is a vector under sp(2n,r) we must have that, for g to be invariant under
g(r) is the duality group then, given the embedding of the duality group into the symplectic
group, (p, q) should transform as a vector of g(z).

duality transformations, (p, q) must transform as a symplectic vector as well. moreover, if

4 the su (1, 1)/u (1) case.

we should now try to solve the rst and most simple case of special kahler manifold. as
mentioned earlier, this example is solved in reference [9]. however, we are going to consider
a dierent approach here which will have the advantage of being more general and therefore
possible to apply to other cases.

the particular form of g for this special manifold depends on the coset representatives
chosen. indeed, if one chooses an unbounded realization of the coset, the representatives
obey the constraint

we have

= p0x0 + p1x1

the sum (29) over (p, q) is carried out only over these su (1, 1)  l orbits.
the constraint (34) can be generally solved. however, we rst should impose an extra
condition to avoid over-counting.
indeed, when one looks at the relation between the
parameters of the coset su (1, n)/u (1)  su (n), given by equation (31), it is obvious that
the parameter x0 is real by denition. therefore, since the -function dened so far includes
x0 as a complex variable and is treated as any other parameter xi, we need to impose some
condition to avoid counting x0 twice. the obvious choice is to impose a similar constraint
over the gaussian integer associated with this parameter, we then set q0 = 0, to set p0

where we have used the parametrization of su (1, 1)/u (1) given by the inhomogeneous

the sum over integers in (37) is an example of the riemann theta function [34], which
we will briey review in the next section. but nally we should note that we could have
constructed a solution to (34) without setting q0 = 0. however, it turns out that the matrix
 in such solution in not invertible (always has an eigenvalue zero).
it seems that this
condition is justied in every sense.

these conditions dene the siegel upper half space hg. it is a generalization to the usual
upper complex plane h1 dened by im  > 0, these conditions guarantees the convergence
of (40). these conditions are just a particular form of the riemann bilinear conditions.

where  (0, )  (0, i ). in other words our -function is nothing but a mellin trans-
formation of a riemann theta function. the factor of 1 correspond to the 0-modes that are
not present in the original (37). how (45) transforms under duality will be discussed later.
the limit (28) can be taken simply by considering the behavior of (s) as s goes to zero.

if we denote (45) as (s) = ((s))1 i(s), we have

the second term in (46) is more involved. we will prove that i(s) can be expanded in
a laurent series around s  0 with simple pole at s = 0. we will also calculate the residue

hence the function () is well behaved and nite once the pole is subtracted.

invariances of (49) are not dicult to establish. one just has to look at the periodicity
conditions (42 and 43) of the riemann theta function for z = 0. we will discuss this bellow,
rst we need to establish some properties of (49).

4.2 mellin transformation.

the function  ( (t), s) of equation (49) is known as a mellin transformation, we briey
review a few facts about this transform [32] since they are important in our study of the
automorphic functions.

we dene the mellin transformation of a function f (x) as

m [f (u)]  z 

0

dx xu1f (x);

(50)

c and re s > k.

for instance the gamma function, (s) is the mellin transformation of the exponential
function, f (x) = ex. the condition for m [f (u)] to be properly dened is that, for x > 0,
the function f (x) decays rapidly at innity, and at the origin it diverges at most as a
polynomial f (1/x)  o(xk) as x  0. with these conditions m [f (u)] converges for
u 
with the conditions described above we can study (49). lets assume that a function
( ), convergent as   , satises the functional equation

(

) =

k

xk=1

bk  k +   h ( )

(51)

for  > 0 and  6= 0, k, h, bk complex numbers. then the mellin transformation of ( )
can be written as a sum r 0 = r 1
hxk

0 +r 1 , and we have
bk k +   h ( )is1 d +z 

m [(, s)] = z 

1

( ) s1 d

(52)

where we have used the functional equation in the rst term.

after we perform the rst of these integrals we are left with

m [(, s)] = xk

bk

s  k

+ z

( ) s1 d +  z

( ) hs1 d.

(53)

the rst term gives the poles of the mellin transformation at k with residues bk. the
second term is convergent for all values of s. if we now use the functional equation twice,
we obtain a second version of it

(

integrating as before, we obtain

m [(, s)] = xk

(55)

therefore we arrive at the conclusion that the mellin transformation of  as dened, is

invariant (up to a factor of ) under s  h  s,   1

m [ (, s) ] =  m [ (

with poles at k and residues bk.

in the mellin transformation under consideration (49), the functional equation can be

obtained using the poissons summation formula:

exp[ ~nt  a  ~n] = (det a) 1

exp[ ~mt  a1  ~m].

(57)

this amounts to obtaining the transformations properties of (0,  ), dened by equation
(45), when   1

we dene ( )   (0, )  1  ( )  1 and make use of (57) to get

where we have set  = (det )1/2 . however we also have that

( ) = ( 1)

(58)

(59)

this is because the sum implied in the right hand side of the equation can be obtained by
re-arranging the sum in the left hand side. in fact, just by looking at the form of  and
1 in (39) and (38) one can see that, by redening the integers in the sum (36) as

n  m

and

m  n,

we go from the l.h.s. to the r.h.s. of (59).

therefore we have the following functional equation:

(

1


) =   ( )  1 +   ;

(60)

(61)

where we just have to use what we have already learned about the mellin transformation
to learn about () in (49). we have, in (51),

h = 1

and

1 = 0
2 = 1

b0 = 1
b2 = .

(62)

we conclude that (s, ) extends to a holomorphic function of s, except for simple poles
located at s = 0 and s = 1, with residues 1 and  = (det )1/2 respectively. moreover,
up to factors of , the function (s) is invariant under s  1  s.
thus we have completed the expression (49) which, after a mild abuse of our notation,
we write as

lim
s0

1
s

((s, ) +

)

(63)

the desired -function is nite and well dened. it is however dicult to give an general
solution to the mellin transformation, we will try to give an answer to that later.

having found the form of the rst term in the expression (29) it is now easy to compute the
su (n)u (1) . the second term is nothing but ((t)), therefore the
automorphic function of
rst two terms pick the real part of this function. the third term can be computed using
riemann -functions as dened before in section 3.

collecting all the results of this section we can write

eg = ||2 ek = e4 re  ( (t) ) |1  tt|

finding a form for this expression in terms of known functions of mathematical physics is
rather complicated. we will make some attempts in that direction later. it is also important
to verify that the expression found is invariant under duality transformation. the original
expression (28) obviously is, but we should discuss this later with more detail.

5 known results.

we should now focus in the problem of nding an analytic form of the function we have
dened. fortunately this is possible for the case of the coset we have just seen in the
previous section and we should show that it is possible in general. in particular, we shall
nd the results of ferrara et. al. in [9].

to proceed we need to make a direct integration of the -function, as dened in (29).

the rst term renders the eisenstein series

(s) z

d  s1(cid:16) (0, )  1(cid:17) = xm,n6=0

(q(m, n))s

(69)

where q is the quadratic form dened (38) and where we have also identied it with the
mellin transformation studied in the preceding section. this eisenstein series is convergent

13

for res > 1 but can be analytically continued to the whole complex plane. the derivative
of the resulting function just as we saw  has poles at s = 0, 1. taking into account the
three terms of the -function (29) and once the derivative against s is taken, one can easily
see that nal eisenstein series to calculate becomes

g (t, s) = xm,n6=(0,0)

(1  tt)s

|  q (t, m, n)|2s .

(70)

this form is important because it allow us to study duality transformations on the the
automorphic function in a convenient way. but, for the eects of the calculation, we will
work with the form broken up in three pieces and will concentrate our attention in (69).

first we will change our variables as follows:

t  t =

1  t
t + 1

and t =

1  t
t + 1

which means, for the automorphic function,

   = (cid:18)

(cid:19)

using the so-called chowla-selberg formula [36], we can nd an analytic form of the
automorphic function, in terms of known functions of mathematical physics. this process
is similar to the demonstration of kroneckers first limit formula. to do this we need to
use the general form of the poisson summation formula, namely,

1

(t + t ).

this amounts to converting the sum in the l.h.s.
for g(x) into a sum over its fourier
transformation g( ) in the r.h.s. here g(x) is a continuous function of x which decreases
rapidly for x  .

in our case (69), using the quadratic form dened in (72), we can write

where we have dened

z =

(1  t ) and  =

we also can split the sum as p(m,n)6=(0,0) = (2pn=0, m>0 +2pn>0,m

z).

(76)

from previous sections we learned that the function

2 g(s)  (s) x(m,n)6=(0,0)

(q(m, n, z))s

(81)

extends to a meromorphic function in the complex plane. we also learned that it has a pole
at s = 0 and that, once the pole is subtracted, the resulting function is regular in the limit.
we know too that (49)

is convergent.

15

where (s) now denotes the -function dened in (69).

collecting all our ndings so far, we can write

2 g(s) = s (s) (2s) + 1/2s (s  1/2) 12s(2s  1)

+ 21/2s xn>0,r6=0

e2irnzn1/2s|r|s1/2ks1/2(2|r|n).

(83)

the function (a)a/2 (a/2) (a) is holomorphic in the complex plane [32], it has a

simple pole at s = 0 with residue 1.

using the identity

we nd

(85)

where c0 is a constant of no importance to us and we have make use of the value (1) =

ln (z) =

iz

12  xm,k>0

where (z) is the dedekind function. thus we end with the expression

( 2 g(s) +

lim
s0

s

) = ln (z + i) + ln (z + i) + c0

(86)

(87)

this equation resembles the first kronecker limit formula of the theory of elliptic functions
[38, 32]. both terms are convergent.

5.2 putting it all together again.

we recall here that we need to add the complex conjugate to the formula (87), corresponding
to the second term of the -function expansion (29) to obtain the automorphic function. a
third term should be added as well, provided in the equation (68), with the kahler potential
written as in (72) in the transformed variables t .

in short one nds, with the values of z and  given by (75), that the automorphic

function of su (1,1)
u (1)

can be written as

eg = ||2 ek = [| (t )|4 (t  t ) ] + c

(88)

where we have included a factor of i into the variable t and the constant term c is moduli
independent. what we have obtained here is the classical result of reference [9] (up to
constant moduli-independent factors).

the automorphic function is invariant under t  t + 1 and t   1
the question now is why go through all this lengthy process to nd what we already
knew? the reason for this is that the procedure described here can be generalized to cosets
beyond su (1,1)
u (1)su (n) . we will describe the next case in the following
u (1)
section.

t , therefore it is

and to any

su (1,n)

6 the su (1, 2)/u (1)  su (2) coset and the general
ansatz.

as before the integers are subject to the su (1, n,z)-invariant constraint

(pixi + qifi) = p0x0 + p1x1 + iq1x1 + p2x2 + iq2x2.

the form of the automorphic function in this case, taken from (28), is going to depend on

(p0)2 = (p1)2 + (q1)2 + (p2)2 + (q2)2

(89)

(90)

where we have also set the to zero the partner of the imaginary part of x0.

the constraint (90) is also possible to solve [33], in the same spirit of the solutions

provided for the previous example. indeed, one can write

p0 = (n1)2 + (n2)2 + (n3)2 + (n4)2
p1 = (n1)2 + (n2)2 + (n3)2 + (n4)2
q1 = 2n1n2
q2 = 2n1n3
p2 = 2n1n4

z4. this provides a general solution to (90). however, there is

(91)

for ~n  (n1, n2, n3, n4) 
one set of numbers that are not produced by this array. nevertheless, such solution can be
constructed using it.

to be more precise, the square of an integer is always 0 or 1 modulo 4. that is, the
l.h.s. of (90) equals 0, 1
(mod 4). since the sum in the r.h.s is a sum of four squares we
can have that the r.h.s can be any integer. (in fact, it was lagrange who proved that any
integer can be written as the sum of four squares.) since there is the equality in the middle,
only some combinations of numbers can satisfy the condition. the correct combinations
are given in table 1.

17

6.1 first contribution to the automorphic function.

it is not dicult to see that solutions i and ii can be generated by (91). solution iii is
generated as follows: take all numbers in ~n to be odd, this means that all the expressions
in the l.h.s are even. we now divide by two all the expressions of the r.h.s of (91). the
resulting solution corresponds to case iii. we will concentrate rst in the contribution of
the cases i and ii, the third will be discussed at the end.

implementing the solution given above leads to the -function

the resulting mellin transformation is not easy to analyze in this case. however, we can
still work out some form of the fourier transformation in the other half of the procedure. a
general form of such expansion is provided by the recursive use of the poisson summation
formula (73) as shown in reference [39].

this is a recursive formula which leads to an analytic although complicated fourier
expansion of the automorphic function. one can, however, use the fact that 2 has some

thus we have simple poles at s = 0 and s = 3/2 with residues 1 and +1 respectively.
[40],

the rst part of the sum is more involved. first we make use of the poisson formula

over every component of ~n . then we can integrate with the help of the identity

for ,  6= 0.

we have to notice here that this expression can not be brought to a form similar to the case
of su (1, 1)/u (1), where the indexes and exponentials were 1/2 instead of 3/2. that is, the
presence of the other moduli cannot be switched o simply by setting the moduli and the
winding and momentum numbers to zero. if one is to consider that case, the approximation
should be made in the previous step of the calculation and not implemented as truncations
in the fourier expansion (108).

the pole structure of the above formula is not dicult to study. however, according to
(s)) which extends

what we have already learned, we are interested in the function ((s)2
to a meromorphic function in the complex plane, except for poles at certain values of s.

since the third term is convergent as long as the exponentials are in the upper half plane,
the poles are given by the rst two terms. we nd that after the use of the properties of

the mellin transformation the function 2g(s)  (s)spn
in 81) has simple poles located at s = 0 and s = 2 with residues 1 and +1. hence, after
making a laurent expansion and subtracting the pole, we can proceed to study the limit
s  0 in the expression (108).

make use of (84). so, we can write

(109)

this is essentially the last formula of this section. presumably there could be a way of
writing the sums in (110) in terms of known functions but that looks like a dicult task.
s ) and therefore the auto-
morphic function (68), considering only the contribution from the solutions i and ii of table
1, is given by eg = e4 re(2(t,a)) |t + t + a a|.
a general ansatz for nding the automorphic functions of coset manifolds of the form
su (1, n)/su (n)  u (1) can be deduced from the above discussion. indeed, the recursive
use of the formulas (91) is not dicult to implement and the rest of the equations are also
easy to generalize. the inclusion of more moduli ai into our formulas would only increase
the dimension of the matrix 2 but its general structure remains the same

so the -function function to be calculated is the mellin transformation

d  s1 [n( )  1].

(112)

it is also easy to see that the positions of the poles of the fourier expansion of (s)gen(s)
are aected; nonetheless, one can see that there is always a pole at the position s = 0 (due
to the particular points n1 6= 0, ~n = 0 for example). once this pole is subtracted we obtain
a regular expression for the automorphic function. the nal form for a general coset will
depend on the recursion formulas for the bessel functions, but the structure of the solution
is similar in form to (106).

6.2 second contribution to the automorphic superpotential
and final expression.

we saw in the previous section that the su (1, n)-orbits described by the constraint (90) can
be divided in three types given in table 1. however, we have only considered the solutions
provided by the cases i and ii. we will now see what happens to the extra piece, coming
from the solution iii. in short we just nd that the riemann theta function (92) gets extra
terms and gets promoted to a -function whose general expression is given by the denition
(44).

the solution to constraint, following the procedure explained after the equation (91), is

given by

that the truncation ~n = (m, 0, 0) and a = 0 does not render the results of the previous

otherwise, one is just visiting a particular point, but not a special one, of the function

7 the action of the symplectic group.

there is some similarity between the matrices (t, ai) of the previous section and period
matrices of compact riemann surfaces [3, 4, 5]. for instance, it has been noticed that
manifolds with special kahler geometry (like the moduli space of calabi-yau manifolds)
give rise to matrices which transform in the same way as period matrices. here we will see
another example of such relation, the profound meaning of which is yet to be claried.

the moduli of calabi-yau manifolds are of two dierent classes, those parametrizing
the deformations of the complex and those parametrizing the deformations the kahler
structures. the dimensionality of each of these pieces is given by the elements of the hodge
diamond which contains the information about the (2, 1) and (1, 1)-forms that parametrize
the deformations.

the holomorphic three-form	 that describes the variations to the complex structure can
be expanded in terms of a canonical homology basis of h3(m,z), where m is the calabi-
	. where we recognize
the periods of [5]	 are given by za  raa

yau manifold in which the compactication of the string is taking place. if we denote this
basis by (aa, bb), with a, b = 0, 1 . . . b21, and the dual cohomology basis by (a, b), so we
have the symplectic relations

the symplectic group has a natural action over the periods matrix  (t, ai) of the
previous sections (to be precise a period matrix of a compact riemann surface has dimension

this is also very similar to the transformation rules that one nds in toroidal and orbifold
compactications, see [41, 11] for examples. since the duality group can be embedded
into the symplectic group then (128) represents the transformation rule of  (t, ai) under
t-duality.

there are also some more striking similarities between period matrices of the three-form
of calabi-yau manifolds and period matrices of riemann surfaces. these are given by the
appearance of the theta functions that we came across during the computations of the
automorphic function.
in fact riemanns theta functions, as dened before in (40), are
dened within the context of riemann surfaces.

denes a complex torus. such torus is called the jacobian variety of c, denoted j(c).
moreover, since the period matrix satises,

two abelian varieties are isomorphic if their period matrices are related by the symplec-
tic transformation (128). the moduli space of the complex torus is therefore identied as

[42, 32, 34]).

ag is endowed with the structure of a complex analytic space (a complex manifold away

where k 

functions of 

riemanns theta function, as dened in (40), for example, obeys the relation

(0,1)2 = det(i) (0, )2.

(131)

hence, (0,1)2 is a modular form of weight 1. in the case g = 1 that we addressed
when we studied the space su (1, 1)/u (1) the automorphic function could be given in terms
of a well knows modular function (the dedekind eta function) obtained from the mellin
transformation of a theta function (via the kronecker limit formula). however, showing
that the automorphic function, in the general case, is a siegel modular function seems like
a formidable task, at least from the explicit expression (124).

nevertheless, the integral from which we originate our results, namely (28), is invariant
under duality transformations. the integral is regular up to a pole that we subtract,
independent of the moduli and, therefore, the nal result should keep these invariances.
in this sense one should be able to express the resulting function (124), in terms of siegel
modular forms. the correct functional dependency is still work in progress. siegel forms are
presented in [44]. it is interesting to note that the threshold corrections to gauge couplings
in (0, 2) compactications have been constructed in terms of the these modular forms [19].
this type of compactication arise with the introduction of wilson lines.

another possible use of regularization procedure is the calculation of integrals like those
appearing in [19], the integral proposed in this reference is very similar to the integrals that
we regularized here, namely

z z4d(, t,a, k1, k2)ca(, k1, k2)

 = z d

2 xk1,k2

where ca is a holomorphic moduli-independent function and

z4d = xn1,n2,m1,m2

although not exactly the same problem, one can easily see how to use what we have learned
in this paper to compute this type of integral.

27

going back a bit in our discussion one can conclude that there is a correspondence
between the moduli space of a calabi-yau manifold and the moduli space of a complex
abelian variety. moving on the moduli space of the calabi-yau would correspond to moving
on the moduli space of the associated complex torus (associated through the period matrix
). exactly how far this similarity between these two spaces can go is dicult to establish.
the structure of ag is still the matter of much research by mathematicians, this is known
as the schottky problem (see the references given above in this subsection).

torus, only generalized to the torus of given by the previous expression. the automorphic
functions therefore are nothing but generalizations of the usual elliptic functions usually
associated with the torus. however, the role of this underlying compact riemann surface
is not clear at the moment.

8 conclusions

the main result of this paper is the construction of automorphic functions of manifolds with
special kahler geometry. this kind of geometry appears in manifolds which are the moduli
space of calabi-yau spaces. our method starts with the duality-invariant formula 2 and
using -functions we rst obtain a well known result for the simple case of su (1, 1)/u (1),
then we proceed to solve the case of su (1, 2)/[su (2)  u (1)].
it is also interesting to note that the construction of such solution is one comes across
riemann theta functions which have a period matrix. given this plus the action of the
symplectic group over this functions (which can be seen as duality-transformations) one
can interpret this matrix as the period matrix of some abelian variety. unfortunately,
at this point, one can only speculate about the nature of this underlying variety. this
situations is somehow similar to the seiberg-witten solution of n = 2 supergravity and
some research in this line could provide some interesting insights into the structure of calabi-
yau compactications of string theory. of course this connection has been noticed before
by candelas but we are able to provide particular examples of such varieties. generally
speaking our method can be generalized to other manifolds to which the formula 2 applies.
in many ways therefore one should be able to reproduce the results of [21], [22] and others
based on the so(2, 2n)/[so(2)  so(2n)] coset manifolds.
