quantum kaluzaklein compactifiation

corneliu sochichiu

abstract. kaluzaklein compactication in quantum eld theory is analysed
from the perturbation theory viewpoint. renormalisation group analysis for
compactication size dependence of the coupling constant is proposed.

introduction

development of the string theory [1] increased interest to eld theoretical and
quantum mechanical models in high dimensions (d  5). the consistency of string
theory need it to be formulated in either d = 10 for supersymmetric strings or
d = 26 for bosonic ones, while everyday physics is four-dimensional. from the
other hand most interesting eld theoretical models can be consistently formulated
at dimensions not exceeding four. compactication of extra dimensions existent in
string theory to have four-dimensional physics at the low energies conciliates these
facts.

it would be interesting to explain this mechanism dynamically, at least in some
approximation at low energies. much optimism is inspired by the progress in un-
derstanding non-perturbative strings and and in special ads/cft correspondence
[2, 3, 4].

in the present work, however, we address a dierent question: what is the eect

of the compactication on the level of quantum eld theory?

it is known that certain quantum eld theories/gravities can serve as low energy
eective actions for string theories. since the string description must not enter in
contradiction with low energy eld theoretical one, one can limit oneself to study
of the last.

as an important example can serve ten-dimensional iia string model whose
low energy eld theory is iia supergravity. as it is believed string theory for
large couplings (gstring) results in an eleven-dimensional model (m-theory).
its
low energy eective eld theory model is d = 11 supergravity. therefore, stringy
corrections for large gstring in iia supergravity must led to the eleven-dimensional
theory (see [5] for a recent review). it is, however, easer to see instead the transition
from higher dimensional model to lower one.

in classical physics, compactication of a (d + p)-dimensional model to d di-
mensions is given by conning some p spacial dimensions of original space-time
to form a compact manifold.

from the d-dimensional point of view the spectrum of the compactied model
consists of a light eld which corresponds to constant or zero mode on the compact
directions and an innite number of massive elds corresponding to non-constant in
the compact direction modes or kaluzaklein (kk) modes. masses of kk-modes

are proportional to inverse compactication size m = r1 (i.e. the typical size of
the compact dimensions). in the limit of strong compactication kk-modes acquire
large masses and do not propagate, and decouple at the classical level.

in quantum description, however, virtual kk-particles can contribute even for

energies less than their masses, becoming signicant as they are approached.

in the limit of zero compactication size one expects to have all the kk-modes
decoupled also in quantum theory since their masses become innite. in fact, the
elds not only do not simply decouple in this limit but they may also produce addi-
tional divergences. also, extra divergences appear even for nite compactication
sizes due to innite number of elds. these divergences are natural reection of
the fact that usually similar models in higher dimensions are more divergent.

as one can see these divergences can be eliminated in the framework of the
standard renormalisation procedure and one is left with renormalised physical pa-
rameters which depend on the size of the compact space.

in actual paper we are going to consider a simple (toy) model to illustrate above
ideas. we will consider d + 1-dimensional 3-model compactied (on a circle) to a
d-dimensions.

the structure of the paper is as follows. in the next section we consider com-
pactied d + 1-dimensional 3 model, and in the second one its d-dimensional
one-loop eective action. we also analyse the renormalisation group dependence
of the eective d-dimensional coupling on the compactication mass m . in the
appendix we give some properties of  and -functions used in the body of the
paper and describe the computation of the eective action.

1. compactified 3 model

let us consider d + 1 dimensional 3 model described by the following classical

action

(1.1)

s =z dd+1 x(cid:18) 1

( )2

where bar always refer to d + 1-dimensional quantities. we compactify this model
along d-th spatial direction by requiring equivalence of xd     + 2r, where
r  m1 is the size of compactication.
consider the (innite) set of d-dimensional elds n(x) which is fourier trans-
form with respect to the d-th coordinate

xn=

where m = r1 is the energy scale of compactication, and elds n are given by

 .

the d-dimensional coupling  in eq.(1.4) is related to d + 1-dimensional one 

by compactication size dependent rescaling:

(1.5)

 =



2r

=r m

the rescaling take place due to dependence of coupling dimensionality on the
space-time dimension. indeed, dimensions of the scalar eld  and cubic coupling
 in d space-time dimensions are respectively (in mass unities):

(1.6)

(1.7)

[] =

2  1,

[] = 3 

thus, the coupling must acquire a  m 1/2 factor while descending one dimension.
now, the the action for zero-mode eld (x)  0(x) only is just the naive
d-dimensional scalar eld action, i.e. one that one would have in d dimensions.
beyond this standard d-dimensional part there are also terms for higher kk-modes
n, (n 6= 0) and ones responsible for their interaction with . making such sep-
aration in d-dimensional elds and kk-modes explicit one can rewrite the action
(1.4) in the following form

(1.8)

sd+1 = sd() + s(, n, n), n > 0

where actions sd() and s(, n, n) are given by the following d-dimensional
lagrangians

nn n+n ,

where the primed sum is taken over all values of n and n which satisfy n, n 6= 0
and n 6= n.
from the explicit form of eqs (1.8-1.10) one can see that elds n, n 6= 0 are
charged with respect to u (1) group acting as n  einn. this transformation
corresponds to shifts (rotations) in d-th (compact) direction, and leaves the action
(1.8) invariant. gauging this symmetry give rise to u (1) kk gauge eld a.
in the compactication limit: r  0 (m  ) the kk modes aquire innite
masses and as we mentioned are expected to decouple. in this limit kk modes do
not propagate anymore, but due to their interaction with remaining d-dimensional
elds they can produce a non-vanishing contribution. in fact this contribution is
divergent, divergencies being accomplished also by the innite number of kk-elds.
the extra divergences of compactied model are easily explained by the fact that

index divergence in higher dimensions is worse than in lower.

to evaluate the eect of compact kk-modes on d-dimensional theory let us

compute the eective action for zero mode , in one-loop approximation.

2. the effective action

the eective action for the eld  is given by the following equation:

(2.1)

eisef f () = eisdz yn>0

dndneir ddx l(,n,
n).

in what follows we will consider compactication size to be small. the presence
of the compactication size in the model introduces a new scale parameter.
in
fact one can identify this scale with the cut o one, but we will not do this at the
moment.

to compute eective action sef f at least in the framework of the standard
perturbation theory one needs rst to regularise path integral (2.1). during this
calculation we use dimensional regularisation scheme and perform wick rotation:

kk-mode propagators look as standard euclidean scalar propagators (in mo-

(2.2)

there are also two interaction terms. the rst one is -kk-mode interaction:

and the second one is kk-mode self-interaction term:

typical one-loop diagram with n legs (qi) (i = 1, . . . , n ), produces the

following regularised contributions1 (see appendix a):

(2) d(n  1)!

m

d2nhf (0)

n ( d) + m2f (2)

n ( d; q1, . . . qn ) + o((q/m )4)i ,

where d  d is the (complex) dimension which regularises the theory.

n in eq. (2.5) have the following structure,

functions f (i)

f (i)

n = (cid:0)2n + i  d(cid:1) (cid:18)n +

2 (cid:19) p(i)(q),
i  d

where p(i)(q) is a (homogeneous) polynomial of the i-th degree in external momenta
ql, l = 1, . . . , n .

as one can expect, the right side of eq. (2.5) is divergent in the limit d  d. let
us analyse this divergence and nd the counter-terms necessary for its cancellation.

1as usual in dimensional regularisation computations we assume the coupling to be of the form
 = 03d/2, where  and 0 are respectively a mass dimensional unity and dimensionless
coupling.

the uv divergencies in eq. (2.5) manifest themselves as a potential singularity

of the factor

(2.7)

as d goes to d.

(2n + i  d)(cid:18)n +

i  d
2 (cid:19)

from the properties of - and -functions (appendix b) one can deduce that
the singularity in eq. (2.7) occurs when quantity n + id
is either 0 (then one has
2
singularity in -function times regular ) or 1
2 (when, oppositely, one has regular 
times singular ). as one can see, the latter of these two cases can be met for odd
dimension d while the former happens when dimension is even.

concerning the compactication mass value there may be two essentially dier-
ent situations. the rst one is when the compactication mass is below the cut-o
scale, then a physically meaningful value can be xed for it. in the second situa-
tion the compactication mass is beyond the cut-o it is physically innite and one
meets additional renormalisable divergences due to m  . their elimination by
standard renormalisation of elds, masses, couplings, and mean vacuum eld value
brings us to usual scalar eld model and one cannot speak on the compactication
size dependence since it is physically innite. we are interested mainly in the rst
situation.

in the case when the compactication mass m is kept xed below the cut-o

scale the structure of the uv divergencies look as follows,

n + id

2 = 0, for even dimension d, and, respectively,

n

in what follows let us consider the coupling constant renormalisation due to pres-
ence of the compact extra dimension. in our notations the coupling  renormalises
as follows,

(2.10)

r = z (0)

3 (z (2)

2 )3/2.

as one can immediately see the coupling acquires an innite renormalisation only
in dimensions d = 5 and d = 6. in other cases both z (0)

and z (2)

are nite.

the case of ve dimensions is particular due to compactication mass depen-
dence of divergent terms. this leads to compactication mass dependence of the
renormalisation procedure. as a result one cannot dene in ve dimensions physi-
cal coupling for all values of m simultaneously, but must re-renormalise it for each
particular value of m .

in other dimensions (d 6= 5) the renormalisation is either nite or it is compact-
consider now, dimensions dierent from d = 5, 6. for dimensions four and less,

eq. (2.10) is regular and one just has,

6

the same is true (and regular) also for odd dimensions greater than six. for even
dimensions greater than six, however, eq. (2.11) has singularity in -function which
is cancelled by zeroes of -function. computation the limit yields,

thus solution to (2.13) yields,

(2.16)

2(m0)

1  22(m0)

(2)6 log(m/m0)

,

where m0 is the value of the compactication mass parameter where (m0) was
computed.

eq. (2.16) gives the dependence of the eective coupling  on compactication
mass parameter m . this equation is valid in the approximation p  m . the
behaviour of the coupling is of such nature that it exhibits a singularity at m  
(or compactication size r  0).
this singularity could be expected since there are additional logarithmic diver-
gences of contributing feynman diagrams as m goes to innity.

as a conclusion one cannot compactify seven-dimensional scalar eld model to
six-dimensional one in a way smooth in the compactication size. renormalisation
group behaviour shows that at small values of r = m1 the coupling constant rises
disabling the perturbative analysis.

this is in contrast with the so called large mass decoupling problem [6, 7, 8, 9]

(see also [10])3.

from the other hand, there maybe such a situation for special choice of model
and compact manifolds when the couplings behaviour is asymptotically free at
large m , in this case one can safely reach the compactication limit.

discussions. we found the compactication mass (inverse of compactication
size) dependence of the d-dimensional coupling of the model resulting in com-
pactication of the d + 1 dimensional scalar eld model. we considered the sim-
plest possible case: scalar eld and u (1) compactication. however, this work
can be extended to more complicated cases both as eld content and as the type
of compactication, including various compactications of d = 11 and d = 10
supergravity theories [11].

2here and on we drop subscript r at  since the only  we deal with is r.
3i am grateful to dr. r. ruskov, who pointed my attention to this problem.

more complicated models may contain elds which realise non-singlet represen-
tations of the d + p-dimensional lorentz group, which must be reduced under
compactication to representations of d dimensional lorentz group. this reduc-
tion was considered in the famous slanskys review [12].

it is important that compactied model may be eld theoretically consistent in
spite the non-renormalisability of the original non-compactied one. therefore one
may expect a phase transition with compactication size as order parameter where
the model pass to the d + p-dimensional phase. this is exactly the point where the
d-dimensional perturbation theory fails. thus one may think about d + p-model
as a non-perturbative extension of the d-dimensional one. as we have shown on
the toy model considered in the paper the renormalisation group approach can be
applied to study the compactication size dependence of the model.
