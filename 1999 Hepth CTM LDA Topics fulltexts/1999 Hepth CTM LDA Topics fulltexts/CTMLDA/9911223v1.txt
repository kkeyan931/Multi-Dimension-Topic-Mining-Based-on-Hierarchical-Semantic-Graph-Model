abstract

we review the anomaly inow mechanism on d-branes and o-planes. in particu-
lar, we compute the one-loop world-volume anomalies and derive the rr anomalous
couplings required for their cancellation.

1 anomalies and inow

it is known that a consistent quantum eld theory can happen to admit as
vacuum a topological defect carrying chiral zero modes. the anomaly arising
on the world-volume must then be canceled by an inow from the bulk [1]. this
is the case of consistent superstring vacua with d-branes and o-planes, where
no overall anomaly can arise but zero modes occur. in general, there can be a
net world-volume quantum anomaly, but by consistency, this must be canceled
by an equal and opposite classical inow of anomaly.

the w-z consistency condition implies that any anomaly a is the descent
of some polynomial i(f, r) of the curvatures f and r of the gauge and the
tangent bundles. dening i = di (0) and i (0) = di (1): a = 2ir i (1). i(f, r)

depends on characteristic classes, like (a are the skew-eigenvalues of r)

ch(f ) = tr exp if/2 ,

a/2 .

beside quantum anomalies, arising from uctuations of chiral fermions or
self-dual tensor elds, also classical anomalies can occur, for instance in mag-
netic interactions. consider indeed some defects mi in spacetime x, with the
rr couplings:

s = xi

izmi

c  yi ,

where c = pp c(p) and y = y (f, r). this can be written as an integral over x
by using the currents mi, which are globally determined by n (mi) and locally
given by mi  (xdi ) dxdi  ...  (xd) dxd [3]. the rr equation of motion
and bianchi identity become then (the bar represents complex conjugation)

dh =xi
dh = xi

i mi  yi ,
i mi  yi .

the modied bianchi identity implies that h = dc  pi i mi  y (0)
since this must be gauge invariant, c must transform as c =pi i mi  y (1)

consequently, the rr couplings give the anomaly

, and
.

i

i

a =  ixi,j

i jzx

mi  mj (cid:0)yi  yj(cid:1)(1) .

using the property mi  mj = mij  e[n (mij )] [3], we see that the magnetic
interaction between mi and mj is anomalous on the intersection mij. the
classical anomaly inow on each intersection is aij = 2irmij

i (1)
ij , with

iij = 

i j
2

yi  yj  e[n (mij )] .

(1)

this must cancel the corresponding quantum anomaly [2, 3] (even if, strictly
speaking, subtletes could arise for self-dual objects [3]).

2 anomalies on d-branes and o-planes

consider two parallel dp-branes (b) and/or op-planes (b) on m . the anoma-
lous elds living on their world-volumes can be read from the corresponding
potentially divergent one-loop amplitudes: the annulus, the mobius strip and
the klein bottle for the bb, bo and oo congurations. in the rst two cases,
one nds chiral r spinors, and in the last case self-dual rr forms. these elds
are dimensionally reduced from d = 10 to d = p + 1, and will therefore split
into two sets with opposite chirality or self-duality. anomalies can then arise
only when n (m ) is non-trivial.

2

these anomalies are as usual topological indices, which can be computed
using index theorems or via a path-integral representation as in [4]. in this sec-
ond approach, the topological nature of the results is related to supersymmetry,
and the tangent, normal and gauge bundle curvatures are realized in terms of
fermionic zero modes as (m, n, ...  x; , , ...  m ; i, j, ...  n )

2.1 chiral spinors

the anomaly of a chiral spinor reduced from x to m is

a = lim

t0

tr [d+1  et(i/d)2

] .

the trace is over the eigenstates of i/d on m , d+1 is the chiral matrix on x,
and  is the operator representing gauge transformations. by exponentiating
, as in [4], this can be written as a = 2iz (1), where
] .

tr [d+1 et(i/d)2

z = lim
t0

mathematically, z is the index of a twisted spin complex: z = index(i/d).
the original chiral or anti-chiral spinor on x is a section of s
t (x). on m  x,
the tangent bundle decomposes into tangent and normal components and these
spin bundles reduce to e = (s
n (m )). considering
also an extra gauge bundle v , one has then the two-term complex

n (m )) (s

t (m )  s+

t (m )  s

i/d : [m, e+  v ]  [m, e  v ] .

the index theorem for this spin complex reads

index(i/d) =zm

ch(v ) [ch(e+)  ch(e)]

td[t (m c )]

e[t (m )]

,

and explicit evaluation yields [3]

(2)

(3)

z =zm

ch(f )  ba(r)

ba(r)  e(r) .

physically, z can be interpreted as a partition function. more precisely, for
a super quantum mechanics (sqm) with q = i/d and (1)f = d+1, z would
becomes the witten index [5]:

z = tr [(1)f eth ] .

3

the appropriate sqm is obtained by dimensionally reducing the supersymmet-
ric non-linear sigma model (snsm) form d = 1+ 1 to d = 0+ 1 with neumann
and dirichlet boundary conditions k and  to m : xi = 0, 
1 = i

where the dots stand for standard terms accounting for the gauge background.
due to (1)f , all the elds are periodic and

z =zpdxzpdzp di es(t) .

for t  0, z is dominated by constant paths with only small uctuations:
x = x

interactions and only terms with the maximum number of 0s, and one nds

evaluating the determinants, one recovers nally (3) [6].

2.2 self-dual tensors

the anomaly of a self-dual tensor reduced from x to m can be written as

a =

1
4

lim
t0

tr [i d  et d2

] ,

where d is the hodge operator on x and the trace is over the eigenstates of
d = d + d. the dynamics is constrained to m  x thanks to the transverse
reection i. as before, this can be written as a = 2iz (1), with

z = 

1
8

lim
t0

tr [i d et d2

] .

4

mathematically, z is in this case a g-index of the usual signature complex.

indeed, z = 1/8 index(dg

+), where

d+ : [x, + t x]  [x,  t x] ,
g : x  x (i : (x, xi)  (x,xi)) .

notice that g = z2 is orientation-preserving, as it should, since d and d must
be even. it leaves m  x xed and acts as +1 in t (m ) and 1 in n (m ).
the g-signature theorem gives then

index(dg

+) =zm

[ch(e+)  ch(e)] [ch(f +)  ch(f )]

ch(f )

td[t (m c )]

e[t (m )]

with the denitions e =  t m , f  =  n m and f = i(1)i i n m .
one nds nally [6]

z =

bl(r)  e(r) .

(4)

physically, z looks again like a partition function, and for a sqm with
h = d2 and a symmetry  = d, it would becomes the supersymmetric index

z =

8

tr [i  eth ] .

the appropriate sqm is known [5] to be the trivial dimensional reduction of
the snsm from d = 1 + 1 to d = 0 + 1 ( : (1, 2)  (1, 2)):

finally, evaluating the determinants one recovers (4) [6].

3 anomalous couplings

using the results (3) and (4), the quantum anomalies on n parallel dp-branes
and/or op-planes are found to be

ba(r)  e(r) ,
ba(r)  e(r) ,

ibb = chnn(f )  ba(r)
ibo = chnn(2f )  ba(r)
8 bl(r)
bl(r)  e(r) .
ioo = 
sb,o = 2z c  yb,o ,

1

on the other hand, assigning the anomalous couplings

one gets, according to (1), the classical inows

ibb = yb  yb  e(r) ,
ibo = (yb  yo + yo  yb)  e(r) ,
ioo = yo  yo  e(r) .

(5)

(6)

(7)

thanks to the property qba(r)qbl(r/4) = ba(r/2), the relevant (d+2)-form

component of (5 and (7) are compatible, and anomaly cancellation requires

yb = chn(f ) vuut ba(r)
ba(r)

, yo = 2p4vuut bl(r/4)
bl(r/4)

.

(8)

notice that for non-trivial embeddings and multiple branes, the pulled-back
curvatures depend also on the gauge connection (see for instance [12]).

6

the presence of anomalous couplings of the form (6) for d-branes and o-
planes has been also predicted in particular cases using string dualities [7, 8].
their actual occurrence in the form (8) has been demonstrated in [9] through a
direct string theory computation, by factorizing rr magnetic interactions be-
tween d-branes and o-planes, encoded in one-loop amplitudes on the annulus,
mobius strip and klein bottle surfaces. these couplings have been also checked
though tree-level computations on the disk and the crosscap [10, 11].

4 string theory computation

interestingly, the anomaly inow mechanism on d-branes and o-planes can be
analyzed directly in string theory, where tadpole cancellation guarantees over-
all niteness and implies anomaly cancellation. recall that one can compute
anomalies by evaluating amplitudes with external photons and/or gravitons,
one of them being pure gauge. this measures the clash of gauge invariance
and gives directly the anomaly. only the cp-odd part of potentially divergent
diagrams can contribute. in string theory, these are the annulus, the mobius
strip and klein bottle amplitudes in the rr odd spin-structure.

the amplitudes we want to compute have the form

a =z 

0

dth v phy.

1

v phy.
2

... v phy.

n

v unphy. (tf + tf )i .

the insertion of tf + tf is due to the gravitino zero mode, and the vertices must
have total superghost charge 1. take all the v phy.s in the 0-picture, with an
arbitrary transverse polarisation m or m n , and v unphy. in the 1-picture,
with a longitudinal polarisation given by m = pm  or m n = pm n + pn m .
interesting enough, the latter can then be written as a supersymmetry variation,
v unphy. = [q+ q, v unphy.]. using standard arguments, one can then move q+ q
onto the other operators in the correlation. one gets no eect on the v phy.s,
since they are supersymmetric, but the supercurrent is changed to the energy-
momentum tensor, [q + q, tf + tf ] = tb + tb. the net eect of tb + tb is
to take the derivative of the remaining correlation with respect to the modulus
t, and one is then left with a total derivative in moduli space:

a = z 

0

dt

dt h v phy.

v phy.
2

... v phy.

n

v unphy. i .

(9)

in consistent models, this total anomaly has to vanish, reecting a cancel-
lation between one-loop anomalies and tree-level inows associated to the same
surface. at nite ps, only the ultraviolet boundary t  0 can contribute and
has to vanish by itself. the computation is still dicult, but fortunately, to

7

get a eld theory interpretation, it is enough to restrict to the leading order in
p  0. in this limit, the correlation becomes t-independent and yields at the
same time the anomaly and the inow. moreover, since the correlation vanishes
unless all the fermionic zero modes are inserted, one can use [9, 6]

v ef f.

this holds both for physical and unphysical vertices, with

m n

= pm n + pn m .

the generating functional of (9) is a partition function twisted by the inter-
actions (10) in the backgrounds f +  and rm n + pm n + pn m . the correct
number of physical vertices is automatically selected, the unphysical one being
obtained by restricting to the term linear in . not too surprisingly, the only
role of the unphysical vertex is to take the descent of the remaining partition
function, and the anomaly polynomial is given by i = z  [13].

it is straightforward to applying this general result to standard d-branes
and o-planes. one nds (i =  i is the t -dual of the world-sheet parity )

ibb = z

these are supersymmetric indices, and only massless modes do contribute. ef-
fectively, one recovers precisely the sqm models seen before, reproducing there-
fore the same results for the anomalies and the anomalous couplings.

one can apply this general approach also in more complicated cases, like for
instance d-branes, o-planes and xed-points in orientifold models [13]. this
provides an ecient tool to analyse in detail the complicated g-s mechanism
of anomaly cancellation in this kind of models.
