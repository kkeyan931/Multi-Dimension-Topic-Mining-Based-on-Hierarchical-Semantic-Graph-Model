we have constructed nonrelativistic fermion and scalar eld theo-
ries coupled to a maxwell-chern-simons gauge eld which admit static
multi-vortex solutions. this is achieved by introducing a magnetic
coupling term in addition to the usual minimal coupling.

1 introduction

since the introduction of the chern-simons action as a new possible gauge eld the-
ory in (2 + 1)-dimensional space-time [1], it has been successfully applied to explain
various (2 + 1)-dimensional phenomena including the high tc superconductivity and
the integral and fractional quantum hall eects. the chern-simons term has also
made it possible to construct various eld theoretic models which possess classical
vortex solutions with various physically interesting properties. they include the rela-
tivistic [2], nonrelativistic [3] scalar eld theories, and relativistic fermion eld theory
[4] interacting with abelian chern-simons elds, which admit static multi-vortex
solutions saturating the bogomolnyi bound [5] that reduces the second-order eld
equations to the rst-order ones. in (2 + 1)-dimensions, there are two possibilities
for the kinetic term of gauge eld, maxwell and chern-simons terms. however, the
simple theories with both kinetic terms failed to have vortex solutions. in order for
such theories to have vortex solutions one need to add new elds or extend the models
to supersymmetric theories [6].

recently, kogan and stern[7] introduced a new coupling of the electromagnetic
eld to the matter eld interpreted as a generalization of the familiar pauli magnetic
moment coupling in (2 + 1)-dimensions. the tensor structure in (2 + 1)-dimensions
allows magnetic moment couplings independent of spin representation. this coupling
gives rise to consistent vortex solutions for the relativistic matter eld theories inter-
acting with abelian and non-abelian gauge eld with both maxwell(yang-mills) and
chern-simons kinetic terms[8, 9].

such vortex solutions of (2 + 1)-dimensional eld theories have attracted much
attention recently in the hope of understanding the dynamics of magnetic vortices
appearing in high temperature superconductors [10] in the eld theoretic approach
[11]. the phenomena of magnetic vortices in high temperature superconductors are
determined by electrons conned to move in 2-dimensional surfaces. to understand
such phenomena in the eld theoretic approach, therefore, one is better to study
the nonrelativistic fermion eld theory models which possess static magnetic vortex
solutions. as a rst step to understand the dynamics of such realistic magnetic
vortices in the eld theoretic approach, we construct nonrelativistic fermion eld
theory models that possess static vortex solutions in this paper.

in section ii we construct nonrelativistic spinor eld models where a single two-
component spinor eld couples to a maxwell-chern-simons gauge eld, and show
that they possess static magnetic vortex solutions. in section iii, we consider a non-
relativistic scalar eld theory coupled to a maxwell-chern-simons eld that supports
the static vortex solutions. we conclude with some discussions in the last section.

2 nonrelativistic fermion models

there exist many fermonic eld theory models that possess static vortex solutions.
recently duval, horvathy and palla [13] and nemeth [14] have constructed nonrel-
ativistic spinor eld models that support static vortex solutions, where a couple of
two-component spinor elds couples to a chern-simons gauge eld. in this section
we are interested in constructing nonrelativistic spinor eld models where a single
two-component spinor eld couples to a maxwell-chern-simons gauge eld. for such
models to support static vortex solutions one need to introduce a magnetic coupling
as explained in the last section.

for this purpose we follow the procedure of levy-leblond [15], which enables
one to write the schrodinger equation as a rst order dierential equation. the
nonrelativistic fermion elds must satisfy the schrodinger equation,

s = (cid:16)i


t

+

1
2m

~2(cid:17) = (cid:16)e 

~p2

2m(cid:17) = 0.

(1)

to write this second-order dierential equation as a rst-order one we introduce an
operator  :

where a, ~b, c are matrices to be determined.

  (cid:16)ae + ~b  ~p + c(cid:17) = 0,

(2)

for the solution of eq.(2) to obey the schrodinger equation (1), there must exist
, such that operating  on eq.(2) we recover

  ~p + c

e + ~b

some operator  = a
the schrodinger equation:







 = 2ms.

(3)

by identifying the various monomials in e and ~p, we obtain the following set of
conditions:



a

c + c





a = 0
a
a = 2m
c = 0
c





b

ibj + b



a



bi + b



ia = 0
jbi = 2ij
ic = 0,



bi + b



c

where i, j = 1, 2. dening the new matrices as

b3 = i(cid:16)a +

b4 = a 

c(cid:17) , b



3 = i(cid:16)a

the conditions (4) can be written as





b

b + b

b = 2,

(,  = 1 to 4).

(6)

all the representation of such an algebra can be obtained from those of a cliord
algebra with dimension 2:

 +  = 2,

(,  = 1, 2, 3).

one can easily show that

b = b, b



 = b1, b4 = i, b



4 = i1,

(7)

(8)

satisfy the condition (6), where b is an arbitrary nonvanishing constant and  is an
arbitrary nonsingular matrix.

since we are only interested in the irreducible representations, we may use the
standard results for the pauli matrix algebra, eq.(7). thus we take b = 1, b =
( = 1, 2, 3), and the nonsingular matrix  to be

 =   1 0

0 1 ! .
we now consider the rst possibility of eq.(9),  =   1 0

0 1 ! or  =   1

0

0 1 !, so that b4 =   i

0 i !.

0

(9)

from this choice we obtain the matrices a and c :

a =   i 0

0 ! ,

0

c =   0

0 2im ! .

by using these results the rst-order schrodinger equation (2) can be written as

(cid:16) 1

2

(1 + 3)e + i~  ~p  m(1  3)(cid:17) = 0.

in coordinate space representation eq.(11) reads

(cid:16) i

2

(1 + 3)t + ~  ~  m(1  3)(cid:17) = 0,

(10)

(11)

(12)

where t = 

t and i = 

xi

.

the other choice of nonsingular matrix  of eq.(9) enables one to construct an-
other rst-order dierential equation which is independent of eq.(12). we will discuss
the dierence between the two choices later.

4

we can easily construct a lagrangian which leads to the equation of motion (12).
introducing a coupling to the maxwell-chern-simons eld and a four-fermion self
interaction term, the lagrangian for the nonrelativistic spinor eld can be written as

l = 

1
4

f f  +


4

af + (cid:16) i
+ g(cid:16) 1

2

2

(1 + 3)dt + ~  ~d  m(1  3)(cid:17)
(1 + 3)(cid:17)

,

2

(13)

where  = (

1
2

) is a two-component pauli-spinor eld, is denote the pauli ma-

trices, and  and g stand for the chern-simons coupling constant and non-linear
self-interaction constant, respectively. in eq.(13) d represent the covariant deriva-
tives,

dt = 0 + iea0 + i

di = i + ieai,

l
2

ijfij,

(14)

(15)

where the last term of eq.(14) represents the anomalous magnetic coupling, i, j = 1, 2
and we have used the minkowski metric notation with signature (+, , ).

with both kinetic terms, maxwell and chern-simons, the eld equation for the

gauge eld becomes

  f  +


2

f = ej ,

where the components of j  = (j 0, j 1, j 2) are given by

j 0 =  = |1|2,

eijj j = ieijj  li.

eq.(16) can be decomposed into three equations:

iei  b = e,

ij0ej + ib  ei = eij j j,

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

where ei = 0ai  ia0, and b =   ~a = ijiaj. eq.(19) is the modied gauss
law. in the static limit, eqs.(19) and (20) reduce to

iia0  b = e,
ib + ia0 = eij j j.

equations of motion for the nonrelativistic matter eld can be written as

idt1 + (d1  id2)2 + 2g(

11)1 = 0,

(d1 + id2)1  2m2 = 0.

5

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

substituting eq.(24) into (23), we obtain

1
2m

(d1  id2)(d1 + id2)1 + idt1 + 2g(

11)1 = 0,

(25)

which is the second-order schrodinger equation modied by the introduction of the
gauge coupling and the self-interaction term. in the static limit, dt reduces to ds
t =
iea0  ilb.

in order to nd the static vortex solutions we choose the spinor eld as

then eq.(24) reduces to

 = (cid:16) 1
0 (cid:17),

2 = 0.

(d1 + id2)1 = 0,

which is the self-dual equation, and eq.(23) reduces to an algebraic equation,

ea0  lb  2g = 0.

(26)

(27)

(28)

note that, due to this choice of the spinor eld, i = 0 in eq.(18).

by comparing equations (21) and (22) with the denition of the current, eqs.(17)

and (18), we obtain the eld equations for the gauge eld in the static limit,

eq.(30) can be written as,

iia0  b = e,
ib + ia0 = li.

b + a0 = l.

(29)

(30)

(31)

if we choose the gauge xing condition, a0 = 0, then eq.(29) also reduces to an
algebraic equation. for this system to have consistent static solutions, the algebraic
equations (28), (29) and (31) must be identical. thus the coupling constants l, e and
g must satisfy the conditions,

l = 

g = 

,

e

e2
22 .

the denition of the current, eq.(18), can be written as

ej i = iei + ij0ljj 0.

6

(32)

(33)

(34)

this implies that the current j i includes both the current generated by the matter
eld, ii, and the induced current gi

ind from the magnetic coupling,

gi

ind =

l
e

ij0jj 0

= 

1


ij0jj 0.

(35)

there is no induced charge density because we have coupled the anomalous magnetic
terms only through the time component of the covariant derivative. due to the choice
of the matter eld, eq.(26), the matter eld current, ii, vanishes and the charge
density  = j 0 remains stationary in the static limit.

barci and oxmen [16] have shown that, at every point where we have a charge q
and a magnetic dipole moment z (z is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane in
consideration), the magnetic dipole moment density is given by

~m(~x) =


q

j 0 z,

(36)

in the case where the charge density is stationary and current density vanishes. this
dipole moment density induces an electric current (in (2+1)-dimensional notation);

gi

ind =


q

ij0jj 0.

by comparing this induced electric current with that of our model, we nd

l
e

= 

1


=


q

.

(37)

(38)

we thus nd that there exists a magnetic dipole moment,  =  q
 , in this system.
this anomalous magnetic coupling can be thought of the (2+1)-dimensional reduction
of the familar pauli magnetic moment coupling in (3+1)-dimensions [7].

the solutions of the self-dual equation (27) is well-known and given by

b = ijiaj = 

1
2e

2 ln .

(39)

substituting this into the gauss law constraint, eq.(21), we obtain the liouville
equation for the charge density:

2 ln  =

2e2


,

(40)

where  must be negative for the regularity of the matter density. the solutions of the
liouville equation is well-known[2], and this shows that the nonrelativistic fermion
model described by the lagrangian (13) supports the static vortex solutions.

7

we now consider the second possibility of choosing the nonsingular matrix  of

eq.(9). if we take

 =   1

0 1 ! ,

0

(41)

b4 becomes b4 =   i 0

0 i !. from this choice, we obtain the matrices a and c as,
a =   0 0

c =   2im 0

0 i ! ,

0 ! .

0

(42)

then the rst-order schrodinger equation becomes

(cid:16) i

2

(1  3)t  ~  ~  m(1 + 3)(cid:17) = 0.

(43)

we can also construct the lagrangian for the choice eq.(41) of  with self-

interaction term g( 1

2(1  3))2:

l = 

1
4

f f  +


4

af + (cid:16) i
+ g(cid:16) 1

2

2

dt(1  3)  ~  ~d  m(1 + 3)(cid:17)
(1  3)(cid:17)2

.

(44)

in order to nd the static vortex solutions of this system, we choose the spinor eld
as

(45)

(46)

 = (cid:16) 0

2 (cid:17),

1 = 0.

then the spinor eld equation reduces to an antiself-dual equation,

(d1  id2)2 = 0.

the gauge eld satises the same eld equations (28), (29), and (31) as before, so
that the coupling constants l, e and g satisfy the same conditions (32) and (33).
combining these eld equations we nally obtain the liouville equation,

2 ln  = 

2e2


,

(47)

for the charge density  = |2|2, where the minus sign comes from the dierent
self-dual equation and  must be positive in this case for regular vortex solutions.

we have constructed two possible (2 + 1)-dimensional nonrelativistic fermionic
theories coupled to a maxwell-chern-simons gauge eld that support static vortex
solutions. the static matter eld in these models satisfy self-dual or antiself-dual
equations depending on the choice of the matrix , which determines the sign of

8

the mass and energy terms in the rst-order schrodinger equations, which in turn
determines the sign of the chern-simons coupling constant for regular static solutions.
in ref.[9] it was also shown that two types of static solutions exist for the relativistic
four-fermion theory coupled to a maxwell-chern-simons eld, depending on the sign
of the chern-simons coupling constant . this implies that the nonrelativistic fermion
eld equations (12) and (43) are somehow related to the nonrelativistic limits of the
relativistic eld equations. to see this we consider the free relativistic eld equation,

id  m = 0,

(48)

where  0 = 3,  1 = i1, and  2 = i2. to obtain the nonrelativistic limit of this
equation, we write  = eimt and use the fact that in the nonrelativistic limit the
rest mass is the the largest energy [17]. if we take  = eimt and use the fact that
there exists an ambiguity in choosing the sign of the matrices i in our model, we can
obtain the nonrelativistic equation (12). if one takes the other choice,  = eimt,
on the other hand, one obtains the eld equation (43). thus one can think of two
possibility of the matrix  for the nonrelativistic fermion eld equation, as dierent
nonrelativistic limits of the relativistic dirac equation (48).

it is worthwhile to compare the eld equations we have derived and those of the
ref.[13]. duval et al.[13] have derived their eld equations from 4-dimensional 4-
component nonrelativistic dirac equation by dimensional reduction, while we have
constructed the (2 + 1)-dimensional non-relativistic eld equations directly. by inte-
grating out one of the two component spinor elds (, ), they obtained the (2 + 1)-
dimensional nonlinear schrodinger equation, thus deriving the self-interaction term
automatically. we have, however, introduced the self-interaction term in order to
cancel the eects of the newly introduced maxwell and magnetic interaction terms to
give consistent static vortex solutions.

3 nonrelativistic scalar field model

it is often the case in condensed matter phenomena that spin degrees of freedom in
electron system are frozen and electrons are eectively described as excitations of
scalar elds. for such systems it is meaningful to consider the nonrelativistic scalar
eld theories that possess static vortex solutions, and to use them in studying vortex
dynamics. for this purpose we consider a nonlinear schrodinger eld theory coupled
to a maxwell-chern-simons gauge eld:

l =

where

dt = 0 + iea0 + i

di = i + ieai,

l
2

ijfij,

(50)

(51)

and , g and l are the coupling constants. note that we have also introduced the
anomalous magnetic coupling as in the previous case.

the gauge eld equations are

iei  b = e,
ij0ej + ib  ei = ij(ej i + ljll),

(52)

(53)

where ei = 0ai  ia0, b = ijiaj,  = ||2 and j j =  i
2m (dj  (dj)).
the right hand side of eq.(53) includes the matter eld current j i and the induced
one from the magnetic coupling. equations of motion for a nonrelativistic matter
eld is given by

idt = 

~d2  g||2,

1
2m

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

which is the nonlinear schrodinger equation.

in the static limit, the gauge eld equations become

b = e,
ib = ij(ej j + ljll),

where we have chosen the gauge, a0 = 0. using the well known identity,

~d2 = (d1  id2)(d1  id2)  eb,

the nonlinear schrodinger equation (54) can be written as,

i0 = 

1
2m

(d1  id2)(d1  id2) + (

e
2m

b  lb  g||2).

(58)

in the static limit, the bogomolnyi limit is saturated by the condition,



e
2m

b  lb  g||2 = 0,

and eq.(58) reduces to the self-dual equations,

(d1  id2) = 0.

with  eld satisfying eq. (60) the current density simplies to

j j = 

1
2m

jkk.

10

(59)

(60)

(61)

for static self-dual solutions, eq. (56) becomes

i(b  (

e
2m

+ l)) = 0.

(62)

for the three equations (55), (59) and (62) to be consistent the coupling constants

must satisfy the conditions,

e
2m

,

l = 

g = 



e
k
e2
k2 .

(63)

(64)

following the same procedure as in the fermionic case, i.e. eqs.(34)  (37), we obtain
the relation between l and ,

l
e

=

(65)

this implies that the magnetic dipole moment of the system is given by  = ( 1
 
2m )q. the dipole moment  is dierent from the one in the fermionic case by  1
2m q.
this dierence comes from the dierence in the matter eld structure. in the fermion
models matter eld currents vanish due to the static self-duality condition. in the
scalar model, however, the matter eld current survives after imposing the static self-
duality condition. this survived matter eld current induces the additional magnetic
dipole moment  1

2m q.

the self-dual equations (60) can be written as

b = 

1
2e

2 ln .

(66)

substituting this into the gauss law constraint (55), one obtains the well-known
liouville equation,

2 ln  = 

2e2


,

(67)

the regular solutions of which exist for  > 0( < 0) for the upper(lower) sign. this
model is free of the singularity problem of the scalar maxwell-chern-simons theory
discussed by nemeth, [12] due to the contribution from the anomalous magnetic
coupling.

11

4 conclusion

we have constructed two (2+1)-dimensional nonrelativistic fermion eld theory mod-
els coupled to a maxwell-chern-simons gauge eld, that possess static vortex solu-
tions. the regular vortex solutions of these models are possible due to the magnetic
moment coupling introduced in addition to the usual minimal coupling to the gauge
eld. each of those models supports the regular vortex solutions for a particular
sign of the chern-simons coupling constant, similar to the case of the relativistic
fermion maxwell-chern-simons theory [9]. we have in fact shown that the rst or-
der schrodinger equations satised by the fermion matter eld are the nonrelativistic
limits of the relativistic dirac equation.

we have also cinstructed a nonrelativistic scalar eld theory coupled to a maxwell-
chern-simons gauge eld, that supports static vortex solutions. the regularity of the
static solutions of this model is guaranteed by the magnetic moment coupling, which
enables one to avoid the singularity problem pointed out by nemeth[12].

although these models have the same static vortex solutions as those of the
jackiw-pi model[3] as solutions of the liouville equation, the moduli space dynamics
of the solutions will be quite dierent due to the maxwell term in the lagrangian.
the reason is that the maxwell term is quadratic in the time derivatives of gauge
ai ai, which gives rise to a non-trivial contributions to the moduli space
elds, i.e.,
metric.
it would be interesting to study how such a term modify the low energy
dynamics of magnetic vortices.
