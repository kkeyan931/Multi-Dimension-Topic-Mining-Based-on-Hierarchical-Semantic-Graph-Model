abstract

the recent proposal by polchinski and susskind for the holographic at space s
matrix is discussed. by using feynman diagrams we argue that in principle all the
information about the smatrix in the interacting eld theory in the bulk of the anti-
de sitter space is encoded into the data on the timelike boundary. the problem of
locality of interpolating eld is discussed and it is suggested that the interpolating
eld lives in a quantum boltzmannian hilbert space.

according to the holographic principle [1, 2] one should describe a eld theory on a
manifold m which includes gravity by a theory which lives on the boundary of m. two
prominent examples of the holography are the matrix theory [3] and the ads/cft corre-
spondence [4, 5, 6]. the relation between quantum gravity in the anti-de sitter space and
the gauge theory on the boundary could be useful for better understanding of both theories.
in principle cft might teach us about quantum gravity in the bulk of ads. correlation
functions in the euclidean formulation are the subject of intensive study (see for example
[7]-[21]). the ads/cft correspondence in the lorentz formulation is considered in [22]-[29].
recently polchinski [26] and susskind [27] have proposed an expression for the smatrix
in at spacetime in terms of the large n limit of the gauge theory living on the boundary of
the ads space. a related derivation is given in [28]. in this note we discuss this proposal.

it was suggested [22, 23] that a quantum eld (t, x) in the bulk of ads5 and the
corresponding operator o(t, x) in the gauge theory at the boundary are related by a simple
formula
(1)

lim
r

r4(t, x) = o(t, x)

such a formula might be interpreted from two dierent points of view. one can assume that
the eld o(t, x) in cft is known and study what could be a eld (t, x) in the bulk. or one
can start from a eld in the bulk of ads and study its limiting behaviour at the boundary.
in this note we are interested in the discussion of the latter approach which perhaps can be
helpful for a clarication of the holographic principle.

we consider the following question. let us take a simple model of qft in the at 5
dimensional spacetime, say the massless scalar eld with 3 interaction. can we get the
ordinary smatrix for this model if we start from a quantum eld theory in the bulk of ads
and use the data on the time like boundary of ads in the at space limit? we will see that
an important point here is to answer to the question what do we mean under the quantum
eld theory in the bulk of ads? in other words, how to quantize the 3 theory in ads if
we want to reproduce the at space s-matrix by using only holographical data on the
timelike innity of ads?

first we remind the standard formulae of the scattering theory in the 5dimensional
minkowski spacetime. there are four dierent formulations of s-matrix on the at spacetime,
see for example [30, 31, 32]. they include the in-out formalism, the lsz formula, the
feynman diagrams and the on-shell functional integral representation. it is well known that
all of them are equivalent in the at spacetime. however in a curve background they could
lead to dierent prescriptions.

we consider a massless scalar eld with the action

i = z d5x(cid:26)

1
2

()2  v ()(cid:27)

(2)

where v () = 13 + 24 + . . .. in the in-out formalism one denes an interpolating eld

and inout annihilation operators

a(k, x0) = iz d4x(fk0  0fk)

aout,in(k) = lim

x0

a(k, x0)

2

(3)

(4)

here fk is the solution of the wave equation with a positive frequency,

fk = 0 ,

fk(x) = ei(k)x0 ikx/(2)2q2(k) , (k) = |k|

smatrix is

hp1, . . . , pm; out|k1, . . . , kn; ini = haout(p1) . . . aout(pm)a

in(k1) . . . a

in(kn)i

(5)

one can prove that (5) can be written in the following standard form (the lsz formula)

haout(p1) . . . a

in(kn)i = z

m

yi=1

fpi(xi)d5xi

n

yj=1

here g is the feynman green function,

kj (yj)d5yjx1 . . . yng(x1, . . . , yn) + ...
f 

(6)

this can be can be represented in the perturbation theory as

g(x1, . . . , xn) = ht ((x1) . . . (xn))i

ht ((x1) . . . (xn))i = ht (0(x1) . . . 0(xn)s)s i

where

s = t exp(cid:20)iz d5x v (0)(cid:21)

(7)

(8)

(9)

and 0(x) is the free eld. it is the form (6)(9) that is usually used for computations in
perturbation theory and it can be expressed by using the feynman diagrams.

now let us consider this quantum eld theory in the ads5 spacetime. the universal

antide sitter space is conformal to one half of the einstein static cylinder. the metric is

ds2 = r2 cosh2 [d 2 + d2 + sin2 d]
2  and the penrose diagram is shown on fig. 1 there are null

(10)

where  = 2 arctan e  1
geodesics and t is time like innity.

the action for the scalar eld in ads5 is

i = z d5xg (cid:26)

1
2

gv  v ()(cid:27)

(11)

now we have to quantize the eld and try to repeat the main steps of the scattering theory
(4)(7). moreover we want to study the holographic principle and therefore we shall try to
encode the data on the scattering matrix into a theory on the timelike innity t .
one of problems we immediately get in the attempt to build a quantum theory in ads
space is that there exists no cauchy surface in the space. it is clear from fig. 1 that for
any spacelike surface (for example a horizontal section on fig. 1) one can nd null geodesics
which never intersect the surface. so we have to restrict ourself to build a quantum theory

3

only in a region of ads space. this might be enough since our goal is to study the at space
limit.

ads behaves like a cavity with reecting walls [27] and there are no ordinary scattering
states in ads space. it was proposed in [26, 27] to introduce sources and detectors on the
boundary. then in the at limit one can get the at spacetime scattering amplitude if one
holds the external proper momenta xed as r  . one takes the ads metric in the form

ds2 = r2[(1 + r2)dt2 +

= r2[(1 + r2)dt2 + dxdx 

dr2
1 + r2 + r2d2
3]
(xdx)2
1 + r2 ]

(12)

(13)

(14)

where r2 = xx. one obtains the at spacetime metric at r   in the proper coordinates
t = rt, x = xr. one denotes x = rx, x  s3 and for momenta p = |p|p.
polchinski [26] gave the following prescription for the at space s-matrix

hp1, . . . , pm; out|k1, . . . , kn; ini = lim

and it is interpreted as an operator o in the gauge theory on s3.
for quantization one needs a complete orthonormal system of solutions of the wave
equation. it seems functions {f p} do not form such a system. quantization of the free

scalar eld in ads has been performed in [33]. in the coordinates sinh = tan  the mode
expansion of scalar eld is

(t, , ) = xm,n,l

creation and annihilation operators a
mnl, amnl satisfy the standard bose commutation re-
lations. let us notice here that the hibert space of the large n limit is not the ordinary
bose fock space, but rather it is the quantum boltzmann space [34, 35].the inteprolating
eld is nonlocal and it should live int the quantum boltzmannian hilbert space. it seems
that entangled commutation relations [36] are appropriate for describing collective degrees
of freedom.

the on-shell functional integral representation for s-matrix [32] reads

s(in,out) = z eii()d

one integrates over the eld congurations with the prescribed behaviour at innity.

it will be convenient to think on the smatrix in the rst quantized interpretation. let

us for simplicity consider a process 2  2 in the born approximation . the answer is

2i = z

here we interpret the plane wave as the amplitude of the probability to nd a particle with
given momenta and energy at the point x. the kernel k(x, y) is the transition amplitude
from the point x to the point y. the plane wave describes the travelling of free particle
along the geodesics. we consider the pre-s-matrix < ...|s(r)|... > using an intuitive rst
quantized approach. we take s(r) in the form which naturally generalizes the feynman at
space formula (20),

the kernel admits the rst quantized representation. in particular, for 2  2 process the
formula (21) becomes

here k(x, t; x, t) is the transition amplitude from the point x, t to point x, t . the 2-point

for kas(

1) one expects the formula

kas( p|x, t) = kas(yas( p), tas( p)|x, t)

(23)

(24)

(25)

intuitively it is clear that these asymptotic kernel are solutions of wave equations in the ads
space with special boundary conditions. from the previous discussions it seems natural to
take

kas( p|x, t) =

in conclusion, in this note we have given a recipe of how to encode an information on the at
space s-matrix into the holographic data on the boundary of ads. although this recipe is not
very transparent it permits to decode the at space s-matrix. it would be interesting to study
a relation between the recipe and the operator prescription for the at space holographic
s-matrix. we have proposed that the interpolating eld lives in the boltzmannian hilbert
space.
