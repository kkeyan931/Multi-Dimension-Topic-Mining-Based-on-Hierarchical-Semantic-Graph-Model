abstract

we study the seiberg-witten-whitham equations in the strong coupling regime of
the n = 2 super yang-mills theory in the vicinity of the maximal singularities. in the
case of su(2) the seiberg-witten-whitham equations x completely the strong coupling
expansion. for higher rank su(n) they provide a set of non-trivial constraints on the
form of this expansion. as an example, we study the o-diagonal couplings at the maximal
point for which we propose an ansatz that fullls all the equations.

the low energy dynamics of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories is governed by
a single holomorphic function f known as the eective prepotential. a self-consistent
proposal for this function has been done a few years ago by seiberg and witten [1] in the
su(2) case and generalized to su(n) by many authors [2]. the seiberg-witten solution
for the eective theory of n = 2 super yang-mills can be embedded into the whitham
hierarchy associated to the periodic toda lattice [3]. the link between both constructions
is summarized in the statement that the prepotential of the n = 2 yang-mills theory
corresponds to the logarithm of the todas quasiclassical tau function.

on the whitham hierarchy side, there is a family of new variables entering into the
prepotential known as slow times. they can be promoted to spurion superelds that
softly break n = 2 supersymmetry down to n = 0 with higher casimir perturbations
[4], something that might drive the theory to a vacuum placed in the neighborhood
of the so-called argyres-douglas singularities [5]. aside from this physical motivation
and its mathematical interest, the seiberg-witten-whitham (sww) correspondence also
provides us with new techniques to explore the structure of the eective action of n = 2
theories. in ref.[6], for example, the second derivatives of the prepotential with respect
to the whitham times were computed and shown to be given in terms of riemann theta
functions associated to the root lattice of the gauge group. when evaluated in the seiberg-
witten theory, these formulae were shown to provide a powerful tool to compute all
instanton corrections to the eective prepotential of su(n) n = 2 super yangmills
theory from the one-loop contribution through a recursive relation [4].

it is the aim of this letter to apply the seiberg-witten-whitham equations to the strong
coupling regime of the n = 2 super yang-mills theory with gauge group su(n). we will
start by considering n = 2 su(2) super yang-mills theory and show that, starting from
the whitham hierarchy side, the exact eective prepotential near the monopole singularity
is obtained in a remarkably simple way up to arbitrary order in the dual variable. we
will then consider the generic su(n) case and show that the sww equations do not give
a closed recursive procedure to perform the same computation. nevertheless, as we will
see, these equations can be used to study the couplings between dierent magnetic u(1)
factors at the maximal singularities of the moduli space.

let us start with a brief description of our general framework. the low-energy dynam-
ics of su(n) n = 2 super yang-mills theory is described in terms of the hyperelliptic
curve [2]

y2 = p 2(, uk)  42n ,

(1)

where p (, uk) = n  pn

k=2 ukn k is the characteristic polynomial of su(n) and

1

uk, k = 2, ..., n are the casimirs of the gauge group. this curve can be identied with
the spectral curve of the n site periodic toda lattice and, moreover, the prepotential of
the eective theory is essentially the logarithm of the corresponding quasiclassical tau
function, hence depending on the slow times tn, 1  n  n  1, of the corresponding
whitham hierarchy1 [3]. the derivatives of the prepotential with respect to the whitham
slow times have been obtained in ref.[6]. when restricted to the submanifold tn>1 = 0,
where the seiberg-witten solution lives (we may identify t1 with  in this submanifold
[4]), the rst derivatives are simply

the characteristic e of the theta function entering the previous expressions can be
read, for example, from the blow-up formula derived in ref.[7] for twisted n = 2 super-
symmetric gauge theory to be ~ = (0, . . . , 0) and ~ = (1/2, . . . , 1/2). this is the even
and half-integer characteristic of the theta function when we express it in terms of elec-
tric variables. if we are to consider the physics near the n = 1 (maximal) singularities,
where generically n  1 magnetic monopoles become massless, we should use as local
variables the dual ad,k reached from the former ak after an s duality transformation. in

1it was shown in refs.[4, 6] that the relevant quantities are not tn but the rescaled whitham slow
1 (in fact, the sww correspondence also requires a rescaling of the scalar variables
1 uk). we will always work in what follows with the

times tn = tn/t n
ai = t1ai and, consequently, of the casimirs uk = t k
rescaled variables and, therefore, hats will be omitted everywhere.

ref.[4], a careful study of the sp(2r, z) covariance of eqs.(3) was performed. in general,
if we transform under an element  of the duality group sp(2r, z), the variables ai, ad,i
transform as a vector vt = (ad,i, ai), v  v, whereas the arguments ,  of the theta
function change as follows:

    = (a + b)(c + d)1 ,
   = [(c + d)1]t ,

with atd  c tb = 1r, atc = c ta and btd = dtb. the characteristics (understood as
row vectors) transform as

(6)

(7)

from these equations, the characteristic of the theta function near the n = 1 points,
which we will call d, can be computed to be ~ = (1/2, . . . , 1/2) and ~ = (0, . . . , 0). the
second derivatives of the prepotential with respect to the whitham slow times can be
written in this patch of the moduli space as in eqs.(3) by replacing   d and using the
dual characteristic d in riemanns theta function. these formulae should be suitable to
study the physics of n = 2 super yang-mills theory near the n = 1 singularities. let us
rst consider, for simplicity, the su(2) case.

su(2)

there are two n = 1 singularities related by the unbroken z2 subgroup of the gauge
group, occuring at each of the two points of the vanishing locus c : {u = 22} (here
u  u2 = h2 is the quadratic casimir of su(2)). they correspond to a massless monopole
and a massless dyon, in a given symplectic basis of cycles on the torus. we will study
the point u = 22: all quantities at the other point can be obtained through a z2
transformation. the generic form of the strong coupling expansion of the prepotential at
such singularity is given by:

f =

(8)

where the logarithmic term, coming from the one-loop diagram that involves the light
monopole, has the appropriate sign and factor making manifest that the theory is non-
asymptotically free and that there is a monopole hypermultiplet weakly coupled to the

3

dual photon for ad  0. the remaining power series expansion comes from the inte-
gration of innitely many massive bps states. we shall use in what follows the sww
correspondence to predict the strong coupling expansion of the prepotential (i.e., the val-
ues of the constants fs in the expression above). there is just one sww equation in the
su(2) case, namely the rst one in (3), and it reads

date the result as follows

(12)

the expression above in terms of (ad) makes it simple to expand (11) up to arbitrary
order in ad. it is interesting to mention that eqs.(9)(11) give a non-trivial consistency
check of the dual characteristic previously derived.
indeed, being ad a local coordi-
nate of the moduli space, its corresponding characteristic must be even and halfinteger.
this fact, together with the extra 1/2 factor in the logarithmic term of the prepoten-
tial (8) related to the fact that the massless magnetic monopole comes in an n = 2
hypermultiplet, leads to a unique possibility that makes both members of eq.(9) to t
when an expansion in the dual variable is considered, this being ( = 1/2 ,  = 0). still,
in order to compute the rhs of (9), we must use the rst equation in (2) to obtain

in precise agreement with the results of ref.[8]. notice that the solvability or complete-
ness of the recursive relation that results from this procedure is not granted. it is also
interesting to remark that the sww correspondence allowed us to obtain the exact pre-
potential near the strong coupling singularity without an explicit knowledge of the actual
solution (a(u), ad(u)).

su(n)

the quantum moduli space of su(n) n = 2 super yangmills theory has n maximal
singularities where n  1 monopoles become massless simultaneously. physical quantities
in the neighborhood of any of these singularities can be translated to a patch in the vicinity
of any other by the action of the unbroken discrete subgroup zn . we will consider in
what follows the point where h2 is real and positive. the strong coupling expansion of the
prepotential at such singular point can be written in terms of appropriate ad,i variables

k = k/n) and  o

constant at the n = 1 point, ad,i = 0.

again, we shall introduce this prepotential expansion into the sww equations (3).
these equations allow us to relate the strong coupling expansion of homogeneous combi-
nations of higher casimir operators hm with that of the prepotential. indeed, inserting
(2) into (3), we have

in fact, from eq.(17), both the full expansion of the prepotential around the semiclassi-
cal patch for su(n) n = 2 super yangmills theory [4] as well as the strong coupling
expansion near the maximal singularities in the su(2) case were obtained. the gener-
alization of this last result to su(n), however, faces some diculties. first, the dual
characteristic does not lead to the vanishing of some higher contributions as it happens in
the semiclassical expansion with the electric characteristic e, a feature that allowed in
this last case to explicitely show recursivity [4]. second, the polynomials fs(ad) are not
constrained by classical symmetries as the weyl group in the semiclassical expansion
being the amount of unknowns, then, considerably higher. third, the prepotential (16)
has powers of  of both signs such that, in spite of the fact that a grading still exists,
many higher terms of the expansion appear in the lowest equations spoiling recursivity3.
the sww equations do not seem to be instrumental to study the full strong coupling
expansion of su(n) n = 2 super yangmills theory. other methods have been derived in
the literature to tackle the problem of computing the higher threshold corrections fs(ad).
for example, in ref.[10] this has been accomplished by parametrizing the neigborhood
of the maximal singularities with a family of deformations of the corresponding auxiliary
singular riemann manifold. however, this formalism is not sensitive to quadratic terms
in the prepotential. thus, it does not give an answer for the couplings between dierent
magnetic u(1) factors at the maximal singularities of the moduli space, encoded in the
coecients  o
ij . the existence and importance of such terms has been rst pointed out
in ref.[9] by using a scaling trajectory that smoothly connects the maximal singularities
with the semiclassical region. these terms also appear in the expression of the donaldson
witten functional for gauge group su(n) [7]. to our knowledge, a closed formula for
these o-diagonal couplings has not been obtained so far, except for the gauge group
su(3) [8]. in the rest of this letter, we will apply the sww equations to the solution of
this problem.

let us rst remark that eq.(17) is also valid for the higher casimirs hn = 1/n trn,
n = 2, ..., n [6]. they, as well as their particular combinations encoded in hn, are
homogeneous functions of ad and  of degree n. thus, at the n = 1 singularities, the
lhs of eq.(17) is simply [9]

hn

 log 

= nhn =

n

(2 cos k)n ,

xk=1

(18)

3notice that the same diculties should also appear for su (2) though, as we have explicitely shown
above, this is not the case. the reason for this singular character of the gauge group su (2) is nothing
but the one-dimensional character of its cartan subalgebra as a detailed analysis makes manifest.

where we used the fact that the eigenvalues of  are k = 2 cos k with k = (k1/2)/n.
the derivative of the casimir operators with respect to the dual variables can be computed
at the same point of the moduli space, by using the explicit representation of the curve
in terms of the chebyshev polynomials [4], resulting in

hn

(19)

finally, the leading couplings at the maximal singularity can be easily obtained from the
expansion (16) to be

(20)

where the logarithmic divergence is nothing but the expected running of the coupling
constant to the point where n  1 monopoles become massless.

the derivative of the theta function d with respect to the period matrix has the

following expression when evaluated at the n = 1 singularity

(22)

we have n  1 equations and (n  1)(n  2)/2 unknowns (the components of the
symmetric matrix  o
ij ). thus, eq.(22) has predictive power in its own for su(3) and
su(4). indeed, we obtain for these two cases the following values:

su(3) :

 o

su(4) :

23 = i/ log(2  1)

(23)

(24)

notice that our result for su(3) coincides with that of ref.[8] while the ones for su(4)
have not been found previously. for higher su(n), further ingredients would be necessary
in order to obtain the o-diagonal couplings at the n = 1 singularity. instead, inspired
by the ndings in the last section of ref.[9], we propose the following ansatz for  o

(26)

unfortunately, we are not aware of the existence of an equivalent expression in the litera-
ture to compare with. we have checked numerically that, with our ansatz (25)(26) for the
o-diagonal couplings, the sww equations are satised up to su(9). there is a second
check that we can do using results that do not rely on whitham equations at all. douglas
and shenker showed that the matrix  d
mn at any point of the scaling trajectory diagonalizes
in the basis {sin k n} with certain particular eigenvalues (see eqs.(5.9)(5.12) of ref.[9]).
the couplings (25)(26) satisfy this restrictive condition in the limit of the scaling tra-
jectory ending at the maximal singularity. as long as our solution (25)(26) matches
two very stringent conditions coming from dierent places, we believe that it provides a
faithful answer for  o
mn as well as a highly non-trivial test of the seiberg-witten-whitham
correspondence proposed in refs.[4, 6].

although we have focused on su(n), what we have presented should be generalizable
to other cases. in this respect we point out that relations such as (17) hold for all the
simply laced algebras [11]. many interesting problems are raised by our approach.
in
particular, it would be of great interest to implement the sww equations all along the
scaling trajectory introduced in ref.[9], to be able to compute with them at intermediate
patches between the maximal singularities and the semiclassical region of the quantum
moduli space. we hope to report on this problem elsewhere.
