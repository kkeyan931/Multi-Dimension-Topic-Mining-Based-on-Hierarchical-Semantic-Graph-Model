abstract

in (2+1) dimensions, we consider the model of a n avor, two-component

fermionic eld interacting through a chern-simons eld besides a four fermion

self-interaction which consists of a linear combination of the gross-neveu and

thirring like terms. the four fermion interaction is not perturbatively renor-

malizable and the model is taken as an eective eld theory in the region of

low momenta. using zimmerman procedure for reducing coupling constants,

it is veried that, for small values of the chern-simons parameter, the origin

is an infrared stable xed point but changes to ultraviolet stable as  be-

comes bigger than a critical c. composite operators are also analyzed and it

is shown that a specic four fermion interaction has an improved ultraviolet

behavior as n increases.

fermionic quartic interactions have been very important for the clarication of conceptual

aspects as well as for the applications of quantum field theory. illustrative examples of

such dual role are provided by the thirring and nambu-jona lasinio models. however, per-

turbative studies of the models have been hampered by the fact that only in two dimensions

they are renormalizable. if the number of avors is high enough, a better ultraviolet behav-

ior is achieved in the context of the 1/n expansion which turns out to be renormalizable up

1

to 4   dimensions [13]. various studies have been performed using such scheme [4].

on the other hand, for small n we may consider the models as eective eld theories

[5], reliable at low energies, as it has indeed been done in their phenomenological applica-

tions [6]. besides that, recent studies [7,8] pointed out that in 2+1 dimensions yet another

complementary direction would be available. through the interaction with a chern simons

(cs) eld [9] fermionic elds could change their operator dimension in such way to improve

the ultraviolet behavior of the perturbative expansion. in [8] this conjecture was investi-

gated for the case of gross-neveu model coupled to a chern simons eld and considering

n = 1. although the improvement does happen for the basic eld, we found that quartic

composite operators do not share this property. this means that the behavior of these

operators is not aected by the cs eld. nevertheless, from the characteristics of the 1/n

expansion and also from the non-perturbative investigations based in the schwinger dyson

equation we may expect the existence of relevant four fermion interactions when n 6= 1. in
fact, nonperturbative studies point towards the existence of critical values of n where mass

generation occurs and basic properties of the theories are drastically changed [10,2]. it is

therefore reasonable to expect substantial changes in these theories as n increases, even at

the perturbative level.

in this short communication, pursuing the work of [8], we will present some results on

four fermion theories coupled to a cs eld when n is small but 6= 1. the basic eld ,
belonging to the two dimensional representation of the lorentz group has now both lorentz

and su(n) indices which we will sometimes indicate by greek and latin letters, respectively.

our rst observation is that, due to the fierz identity [11],

(2)

where a, a = 1, . . . , n 2  1 are the generators of su(n), there are only two independent,
lorentz and su(n) scalar quartic self-interactions. therefore, without loosing generality,

we may restrict our study to the theory described by the lagrangian,

actually, evading possible infrared divergences, throughout this paper we will work in a

landau gauge obtained by formally letting   0. as the canonical dimension of  is one,
both g1 and g2 have dimension -1 in mass unity. the model is therefore nonrenormalizable,

the degree of supercial divergence of a generic graph with na and nf bosonic and fermionic

external lines, and with v1 and v2 gross-neveu and thirring like vertices, being equal to

d() = 3  na  nf + v1 + v2.

(4)

to validate our calculations we shall treat (3) as an eective theory, suppressing the high

momenta contributions to the feynman amplitudes. this is conveniently done by intro-

ducing a dimensional parameter  through the denitions g1 = g1/ and g2 = g2/ and

restricting the calculation by requiring that p  . in this implementation g1 and g2 must
then be considered as the perturbative couplings.

to regulate feynman integrals, we use the following dimensional regularization recipe.

initially, the algebra of the dirac matrices and contractions of the  levi-civita symbols are

performed in 2 + 1 dimensions using

and

 = g  i,

 = 

  


,

(5)

(6)

after this step, the integrals are promoted to d dimensions and carried out accordingly the

usual rules [12]. singularities appear as poles at d = 3   which should then be removed.
to this end, to each loop integral we incorporate the factor  where the massive parameter

 plays the role of the renormalization point. the renormalized amplitude is given by

the constant term (i.e., the independent one) of the laurent expansion of the resulting

3

expression. this dimensional regularization method does not require an extension of

the levi-civita symbol outside 2 + 1 dimensions and thus is very convenient for practical

calculations. one should be aware that slight modications of these rules may change the

nite part (for example, using  = 2d instead of -1) of the outcome. however, our

results will not be aected since we will be dealing only with the simple pole part of the

amplitudes (double poles only appear at higher orders, i. e., in the computation of graphs

with three or more loops). actually, with the mentioned restrictions the method has been

applied and tested in variety of problems in 2 + 1 dimensions [7,13].

the vertex functions so dened approximately satisfy a renormalization group equation,

where, as a consequence of the colemanhill theorem [14], a term proportional to the

derivative of the  parameter is absent. the coecients  and i can be calculated by

replacing the two and four point function into (7).

to x  notice that, up to 2 loops, only graphs which are second order in  may contribute

to the wave function renormalization (i.e., linearly divergent graphs with 2 external fermionic

lines). there are 3 graphs (the same as in fig 2 of [8]) and a direct computation gives

(8)

notice that for n = 1 this result agrees with [8], as it should.

analogously, 1 and 2 can be determined from the momentum independent residues

in the four point vertex functions.

in this calculation, it should be observed that the 

dependence of pole part arises through the expansion of the  = 1 +  ln  + o(2) fac-

tors, introduced for each loop momentum integral. we denote the fourier transform of
h0|t1a1(x1)2a2(x2) 3a3(y1) 4a4(y2)|0i by (4)
indices are represented by greek and latin letters, respectively. we found that, up to third

order in g1, g2 and , the  dependence of the 4 point function is given by

 dependent part of (4)

replacing the above expression into (7), using (8) and equating to zero the coecients

since the gross neveu and thirring interactions were taken as independent, these expres-

sions are valid only if n > 1. they show that the renormalization group xed points, dened

through the vanishing of 1 and 2, will require

2 = 2

c =

6[17n  18 + ()1/2]
(3541 + 1900n + 255n 2)

,

(14)

with  = 3865 + 2512n + 544n 2. however, to better understand the nature of this result it

is convenient to use the systematic procedure devised by zimmermann [15] which allows us

to consider just one constant, g1 let us say, as independent. the other coupling is then xed

as to have just one  function in the renormalization group equation. such scheme has been

applied in a variety of circumstances, including cases of nonrenormalizable models treated

as eective theories [16]. we thus suppose that g2 = 0g1 where 0 is a constant such that

2 = 01, which gives

in this situation,

0 = 25  20n + ()1/2

36(3 + n)

.

(15)

1 = g1{1  2[

+ (18 + 6n)0]} .

(16)

from this equation we conclude that the origin is an infrared xed point stable or unstable

accordingly  < c or  > c. at  = c, 1 = 0 and the theory is approximately scale

invariant.

we want now to go back to the question posed at the beginning of this paper, namely,

if n > 1 does the coupling with the cs eld improve the ultraviolet behavior of quartic

operators? if this were the case one could use this quartic interaction to perturb the model

of fermionic particles interacting just through a cs eld. we thus consider g1 = g2 = 0

and study the renormalization behavior of integrated operators of canonical dimension 4.

specically, we dene (symbolically)

1 = z d3xd2 ,

2 = z d3x()2

and 3 = z d3x()() ,

(17)

where d2 = dd and d =   ia is the covariant derivative. the renormalized

integrated operators are obtained by removing poles so that, up to second order in , in

momentum space the renormalized amplitude with the insertion of the operator i is

i = (1   )ii = (ij + zij)

i

(18)

where ii is the dimensionally regularized integral, 

i is the -independent part of i

and the matrix z is given by

z = 22 ln[]

(19)

with this understanding we may write ir = (ij + zij)

j, where 

j is the nite part

corresponding to 

i

although the operators i in (17) are not multiplicative renormalized we can nd new

operators having such property by taking adequate linear combinations i = cijj. the

new renormalized operators are then linear combinations od the old ones, ir = cijjr.

6

the specic form of the matrix c is not actually relevant but it is such that ir =

(ij + zij) j where z is a diagonal matrix. we found

z = 22 ln  diagonal(cid:16)1/3 ,

(20)

we are now in a position to calculate the anomalous dimension for these operators. indeed,

from the above results and noticing that they satisfy

(


  nf +  ir)(nf )

ir

= 0

we arrive at

and

 1r =

 3r =

(21)

(22)

(23)

thus, in the infrared stable region,  < c, there are two operators ( 1r and 3r)

whose dimensions decrease with n. the anomalous dimension  1r has a very small vari-

ation implying that the ultraviolet behavior of the corresponding operator is not improved

in a meagninfull way. the situation is much better concerning the second operator. by

conveniently choosing  near c, the operator dimension of 3r may become near 3 as we

want and, for all practical purposes, the interaction behaves like a renormalizable one. this

operator is therefore a natural candidate for implementing a consistent perturbation scheme

around the conformal invariant theory of fermions interacting through a chernsimons eld.

of course, higher order corrections may modify the above results. thus, increasing the pa-

rameter  will require the inclusion of new interactions and in principle new couplings will

be needed. however, we may conjecture that in this phase, following zimmermanns proce-

dure, it will also be possible to x the new couplings as denite functions of just one four

fermion coupling.
