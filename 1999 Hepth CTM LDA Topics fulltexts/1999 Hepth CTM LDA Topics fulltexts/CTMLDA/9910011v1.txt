abstract

some aspects of correlation functions in n = 4 sym are discussed. using n = 4 harmonic su-
perspace we study two and three-point correlation functions which are of contact type and argue
that these contact terms will not aect the non-renormalisation theorem for such correlators at
non-coincident points. we then present a perturbative calculation of a ve-point function at two
loops in n = 2 harmonic superspace and verify that it reproduces the derivative of the previ-
ously found four-point function with respect to the coupling. the calculation of this four-point
function via the ve-point function turns out to be signicantly simpler than the original direct
calculation. this calculation also provides an explicit construction of an n = 2 component of
an n = 4 ve-point nilpotent covariant that violates u (1)y symmetry.

introduction

the superconformal ward identities play a central role in the study of superconformal eld
theories, and in particular, in n = 4 yang-mills theory. these ward identities can be con-
veniently expressed in harmonic superspaces - either n = 4 on-shell harmonic superspace [1]
which has the advantage that the gauge-invariant operators in short multiplets are represented
by single-component analytic superelds, or n = 2 o-shell harmonic superspace [2] in which,
although the n = 4 yang-mills multiplet decomposes into the n = 2 yang-mills multiplet plus a
hypermultiplet, one can carry out perturbation theory calculations whilst maintaining manifest
n = 2 supersymmetry.

using the harmonic superspace approach to n = 4 sym and motivated by earlier works [3] which
indicated that the ward identities for correlation functions of constrained supereld operators
in superconformal quantum eld theories are stronger than one might naively expect some
interesting results were found. in particular [4, 5], the sym eld strength is a covariantly analytic
supereld w carrying no indices from which one can build a set of analytic gauge-invariant
operators by tracing products of w . the members of this set are in one-to-one correspondence
with the kaulza-klein multiplets of iib supergravity on ads5  s5 [9] and the ward identities
for correlation functions of operators of this type are easy to solve for in terms of prefactors
times functions of superconformal invariants, largely due to the fact that the elds carry no
indices. since there are no three-point superinvariants for the superspaces we are considering,
it is possible to obtain the functional form of three- (and two-) point functions exactly [4,
10], although the ward identities do not determine the dependence of the coecients on the
coupling. for four and more points, the ward identities, when combined with analyticity, do put
constraints on the functions of superinvariants that can arise [11, 12], although these constraints
do not seem to be enough to determine completely the n = 2 correlators that contain four
harmonic matter elds of charge two contrary to the conjecture made in [4, 5]. however, it is
not ruled out that this line of argument cannot be used to show that other correlators can be
found explicitly 2.

to make further progress, therefore, it seems that in general some additional input is required.
a eld-theoretic trick one can use is to derive a relation between n- and (n + 1)-point functions
by dierentiating the path integral representation of the n-point function with respect to the
coupling. in the present context we shall refer to the resulting equation as the reduction formula;
it was rst applied to n = 4 scft in [13]. an important aspect of this formula is that the
(n + 1)-point function includes an integration over the point of insertion of the lagrangian.

one application of the reduction formula is to use the known explicit form of all three- and
four-point superconformal invariants to prove the non-renormalisation theorem for two- and
three-point functions [14]. we mentioned above that the ward identities x the form of these
functions but not their dependence on the coupling although, for the greens function of three
supercurrents, there is an argument [10], based on the absence of counterterms beyond one loop
in n = 4 conformal supergravity [15] which implies that this greens function depends trivially
on the coupling (see also [16]). the result of [14] extends this non-renormalisation theorem
to three-point functions of short multiplet operators with arbitrary charges.
in a sense it is

2indeed, in a paper in preparation [6] we shall use harmonic superspace arguments of the above type to show
that extremal correlators of analytic operators are free. this is in accordance with the recent results of [7] in
ads and also with the results obtained in [8] for the one-loop and instanton contributions to the corresponding
correlators on the eld theory side.

an expression of the u (1)y bonus symmetry rst proposed in [17], and advocated in [13].
although this is not a true symmetry of interacting n = 4 yang-mills theory, it nevertheless
seems to be a symmetry of a large class of superinvariants and through them of n-point functions
of short operators with n  4 [13, 14].
these results on two- and three-point functions are in accord with the conjectured relation
between n = 4 sym and iib supergravity on an ads5  s5 background [18]. however, it was
emphasised in [19] that contact terms can arise in the eld theory and that such terms can
in principle have an eect in the reduction formula because of the presence of an integrated
insertion. contact terms have been observed in two-point functions at two loops in the n = 2
harmonic superspace formalism in [10] and studied in more detail in n = 1 superelds in [20].
the authors of [19] were particularly interested in the eect of such terms on anomalies, but
the contact terms found at two loops are actually consistent with the ward identities. since
the superconformal anomaly is related to the divergences of n = 4 conformal supergravity, and
since, as we remarked above, there are no such divergences beyond one loop, it follows that the
contact terms which could potentially arise in the reduction formula should be consistent with
the superconformal ward identities.

in this article we begin by discussing contact term solutions to the n = 4 superconformal ward
identities using n = 4 superelds. for two points we nd that there are covariant contact
terms for short multiplet operators with arbitrary charges. for three points we then nd all
possible contact terms some of which are nilpotent and some which are not. the latter are not so
important because they cannot contribute in the reduction formula. for the former we nd that
there only exists a solution for the case of three supercurrents. a consequence of this is that, if
the formula is to be valid for contact terms as well as at non-coincident points, it should be the
case that no contact terms should occur for two-point functions with higher charges than the
supercurrent. it has to be admitted that this is not easy to verify directly in perturbation theory
due to diculties that arise in dening the graphs for a small number of points. however, one
can certainly say that the only three-point contact nilpotent covariant does not aect the two-
point non-renormalisation theorem; inserted in the reduction formula it simply reproduces the
two-point contact term for two supercurrents. although we have not investigated the situation
at four points in as much detail, we have identied the four-point nilpotent contact covariant
which gives rise to the three-point one using the reduction formula, and we present an argument
that suggests that there are no additional four-point contact covariants which could interfere
with the proof of the three-point non-renormalisation theorem.
it should be borne in mind,
however, that analyticity can be violated by harmonic delta-function terms and the eects of
this are dicult to analyse in the n = 4 formalism as it is on-shell. this caveat also applies
to the n = 4 version of the reduction formula (see below) which cannot be derived directly in
contrast to the n = 2 version. we are reassured by n = 2 perturbative calculations that these
diculties should not aect our results.

another possible use of the reduction formula is to obtain information about four-point cor-
relators by rst trying to guess or compute the corresponding ve-point ones.
it should be
emphasised that, starting with ve points, one can have nilpotent superconformal covariants of
the non-contact type. in the reduction formula, after the integration over the insertion point,
they can become non-nilpotent. in order to reproduce the known four-point correlators in this
way, one has to assume the existence of a ve-point covariant violating u (1)y invariance [13].
in [14] it was shown that such covariants can only be of the nilpotent type and their expression
to lowest order in fermions was given up to a multiplicative non-nilpotent function.

2

in the second part of the paper we are able to construct explicitly an n = 2 component of
such an n = 4 covariant by calculating a certain ve-point function at two loops in n = 2
harmonic superspace. this conrms the existence of the nilpotent covariant and gives its form
in detail. the ve-point correlator is related by the reduction formula to the correlator of four
n = 2 hypermultiplet bilinear (or charge two) composites. in [21] we derived expressions for
these correlators in terms of three functions of the spacetime variables a1, a2 and a3. the rst
two of these come out as functions of the two independent spacetime conformal cross-ratios. in
fact, a1, a2 are expressed in terms of the one-loop scalar box integral. however, a3 is given by
a generic two-loop integral for which conformal invariance is far from obvious. subsequently, in
[11], we used the superconformal ward identities combined with harmonic analyticity to nd
a relation between a3 and the other two. this enabled us to show that a3 is expressed in
terms of the same one-loop scalar box integral. thus we could verify the conformal invariance
of the entire four-point amplitude. this result was then conrmed by a numerical study of
the integral formula for a3. the calculation we present here is a two-loop computation at ve
points with four charge two hypermultiplet composites and one yang-mills composite tr w 2.
this fth operator introduces a chiral point which one is to integrate over in the intriligator
formula. as expected, we reproduce the two-loop four-point function in a way which makes the
simplied form of a3 immediately apparent. furthermore the calculation conrms the existence
of a ve-point n = 4 nilpotent superconformal invariant which is not invariant under u (1)y .
the calculation also gives direct support to the assertion that contact terms do not make any
signicant dierence to the reduction formula, since none are required in this case.

2 contact covariants

we briey recall the analytic superspace formalism. n = 4 analytic superspace m has coordi-
nates

where each lower case index can take on 2 values. the even coordinates x and y are coordinates
for complex spacetime and the internal space s(u (2)  u (2))\su (4) respectively. the odd
coordinates  and  number 8 in all, half the number of odd coordinates of n = 4 super
minkowski space. an innitesimal superconformal transformation takes the form

x = v x = b + ax + xd + xcx

where each of the parameter matrices is a (2|2)  (2|2) supermatrix and where

g =(cid:18) a b

c d (cid:19)  sl(4|4) .

(2)

(3)

one can show that the central elements in the superalgebra sl(4|4) do not act on m so that one
really has an action of the superalgebra psl(4|4).
from (2) one can read o the vector elds for each of the parameters. they divide into trans-
lational (b), linear (a, d) and quadratic (c) types. the translations are ordinary spacetime
translations, half of the q-supersymmetry transformations and translations in the internal y
space, which is locally the same as spacetime. the corresponding vector elds are

3

vaa =



x aa .

(4)

the linearly realised symmetries are lorentz transformations (sl(2) sl(2) in complex space-
time) and dilations, a corresponding set of internal transformations, the other half of the q-
supersymmetries and half of the s-supersymmetries. the sl(2) transformations are handled in
the usual way so that we do not need to write them down. the vector elds generating dilations
(d) and internal dilations (d) are

a = x a  a aa .

the remaining supersymmetry transformations are the non-linearly realised s-supersymmetries
generated by

v (s)a = a

b  b a b   b yab

finally, we have conformal boosts (k) and internal conformal boosts (k ) generated by

the gauge-invariant operators in short multiplets in n = 4 sym are aq = tr (w q) where w
is the n = 4 sym eld strength tensor which takes its values in the lie algebra su(nc) of the
gauge group. these operators transform as

aq = v aq + qaq

(15)

4

where  = str(a + xc). a correlation function of such operators

g(x1, . . . , xn) =< aq1(x1) . . . aqn(xn) >

should satisfy the ward identity

n

(vi + qii)g = 0 .

xi=1

(16)

(17)

we dene a contact covariant to be a greens function which satises the ward identities and
which is local in the sense that it involves at least one spacetime delta-function. translational
symmetries imply immediately that any n-point greens function depends only on n  1 co-
ordinate dierences, x12, x23 . . . x(n1)n where x12 = x1  x2. furthermore, assuming that
there are no delta-functions in the internal space (which would be inconsistent with analyticity),
linear q-supersymmetry can be used to eliminate a further set of odd coordinates. thus, after
imposing translational and linear q-supersymmetry we nd that a greens function may be
taken to depend on n  2  and  coordinates of the form

123 = 12y1
123 = y1

12  23y1
23 ,
23 23 .

12 12  y1

as well as n  1 y dierences and n  1 modied x dierences, x12, . . ., with

x12 = x12  12y1

12 12 .

(18)

(19)

(20)

in the preceding three equations we have suppressed the indices as the quantities involved in
each expression are arranged in such a way that matrix multiplication is natural provided that
the indices on y1 are taken to be a pair of subscripts in the order aa.

from the foregoing it follows that any two-point greens function, whether contact or not,
cannot depend explicitly on the odd coordinates. for a contact two-point function spacetime
dilations x the dependence on x12 to be of the form of powers of the dalembertian acting on
the delta-function. internal dilations then give the dependence on y12 and so we arrive at the
candidate two-point functions

< aq(1)aq(2) > (y12)2q(cid:3)2q4(x12) .

(21)

it is now a straightforward exercise to check that the expression on the right-hand side does
indeed satisfy the remaining ward identities. we note that the case of q = 2, i.e. the two-point
function of two supercurrents, is the example previously encountered in perturbation theory
[10, 20], although the complete expression for the entire multiplet has not been derived before
to our knowledge.

we now turn to three-point functions. we are primarily interested in nilpotent three-point
covariants as they can contribute to the reduction formula. we remind the reader that this
reads, in n = 4 superspace,

5




< aq1 . . . aqn >=

1

2 z d < t aq1 . . . aqn >

(22)

where the integral is over the point of the inserted supercurrent t (= a2). the measure d
involves an integral over the internal coset and a fermionic integral over , i.e. d  d4x du d4.
using linear s-supersymmetry one can show that a three-point nilpotent greens function with
non-coincident points cannot depend on 123 or 123 and hence must vanish completely. how-
ever, the same is not true in the presence of delta-functions. consider the following expression
which satises the translational, q-supersymmetry and dilational ward identities for three su-
percurrents,

< t (1)t (2)t (3) > (123)4(y12)4(y23)4(x12)(x23) .

(23)

the variation of (123)4 under the rst linear s-supersymmetry (10) is zero, but under the
second linear s transformation the variation depends linearly on x12 and x23. explicitly,

v (s) 

a(123)4 = (x 

12 (y1

12 )aa  x 

23 (y1

23 )aa)(3

123)a
 .

(24)

however, this variation vanishes for the entire right-hand side of (23) due to the presence of
the delta-functions. to complete the proof that the proposed three-point function satises all
the ward identities, it is sucient to check the quadratic s-supersymmetry transformations (4)
since the supersymmetries generate the entire super lie algebra. after some algebra one can
verify straightforwardly that the function does transform in the right way under this symmetry.

we remark that integrating the right-hand side of (23) over point 1, one recovers the functional
form of the two-point contact term given above with q = 2. in other words, the two- and three-
point contact terms for supercurrent greens functions are related to each other by the reduction
formula, and the contact three-point function therefore has no eect on the two-point function
at non-coincident points. we note further that, although the three-point function given above
does not seem to be symmetric under the interchange of any two points, in fact it is. this is
partly due to the presence of the delta-functions and partly because the 4 term can be written
in the form

(123)4 =

(123)4
(y13)4 (y13)4 .

(25)

the (y13)4 factor here combines with the other two y-factors to give a symmetrical expression
while (123)4
(y13)4

is symmetrical by itself.

at rst sight it might seem that the above greens function could be generalised to higher
charges by the inclusion of appropriate dalembertians. however, this is not the case. consider
a general, nilpotent contact three-point function, g, of the type that can contribute in the
reduction formula. it will have the form

g = (123)4f (x12, x23, y12, y23) .

(26)

under the second linear s-supersymmetry the fermionic factor will contribute a term

6

v (s) 

a g  (x 

12 (y1

12 )aa  x 

23 (y1

23 )aa)(3

123)a

f .

(27)

however, it is easily seen that this term cannot be cancelled by terms arising from the variations
of the ys or the xs because the fermion structures are dierent. therefore the above term
must vanish identically. the unique permissible x-dependence of f which ensures this is the
product of two delta-functions, (x12)(x23). however, this x structure demands the y structure
appearing in (23) and so we conclude that this contact covariant is the only one of its type.

one can also consider four-point contact terms that only have a 4 multiplied by a non-nilpotent
factor. by suitable labelling we may choose this to be 4
123. using s-supersymmetry and
repeating the argument leading to (28) we nd that the non-nilpotent factor must contain
(x12)(x23). using the reduction formula we see that such a term cannot lead to a three-point
function that contains no delta functions. as a result we conclude that contact terms cannot
invalidate the non-renormalisation theorem for two- and three-point functions shown in [14].

it is straightforward to construct a sequence of nilpotent contact covariants for an arbitrary
number of points which are related by the reduction formula. for four points the covariant is

< t (1)t (2)t (3)t (4) > (123)4(234)4(y12)4(y23)4(y34)6(x12)(x23)(x34)

(28)

the proof that this satises the appropriate ward identity is straightforward; one simply ob-
serves that the right-hand side is almost a product of two three-point functions of the type of
(23); in fact, morally it is the product of two such functions divided by a non-nilpotent two-point
contact function of the type given in (22) with q = 2. using this, one can show in a few lines
that the four-point ward identity is indeed satised by (28).

this construction can be extended to an arbitrary number of points straightforwardly. the
contact covariant for n t s is simply:

< t (1) . . . t (n) >

n2

((i(i+1)(i+2))4

yi=1

n1

yi=1

((yi(i+1))4(xi(i+1)))

(29)

this sequence of terms is clearly related to each other by the reduction formula and thus nally
to the non-nilpotent two-point function (22) with q = 2. one can also show that all contact
terms which are not nilpotent and have no derivatives acting on the delta functions can only
have the form

(y2

12)2 . . . (y2

nn1)2(x12) . . . (xnn1)

(30)

this can be expressed as a product of two-point functions and so corresponds to a disconnected
greens function. it should be straightforward to extend this result to include derivatives on the
delta functions.

we shall now argue that all contact terms which are not disconnected and do not have derivatives
on delta functions are of the form of equation (29). given any non-nilpotent contact term we
can integrate over the variable associated with a given leg to produce a contact term with one
less external leg. repeating this process and assuming one does not get zero one will arrive at
a non-nilptotent contact term that must be of the form of the above equation. if we further
assume that greens functions that begin as connected do not become disconnected then we
would conclude that the only connected greens contact greens functions are those that lead by

7

repeated integration to the non-nilpotent two-point function and so are as given in equation (29).
if we assume that this result also holds for contact terms with derivatives on the delta functions
we can conclude that all the connected contact greens functions are xed by a single coecient.
the correlation functions of the supercurrent can be generated from an eective supergravity
action obtained by coupling n = 4 sym to a background supergravity and integrating over the
yang-mills elds. the contact terms must then arise from only one term in this eective action
which is superconformally invariant in four dimensions. the unique superconformal function of
the supergravity elds is the n = 4 conformal supergravity action. dierentiating this with
respect to the elds of this multiplet and setting them equal to their at space values should
then give the contact covariants described above.

3 two-loop calculation

in this section we shall carry out a perturbative n = 2 calculation at two loops which explicitly
demonstrates how the reduction formula works. our main aim will be to reproduce the four-
point correlator of hypermultiplet bilinears from refs. [21, 11] as the integral of a ve-point one.
the latter is obtained by inserting the n = 2 sym lagrangian into the four-point correlator.
it provides a more explict form of the nilpotent ve-point superconformal covariant which was
consturucted to lowest order in [14]. this term violates the u (1)y symmetry of ref. [13].

3.1 n = 4 sym in terms of n = 2 harmonic superelds

the absence of an o-shell formulation of n = 4 sym theory does not allow one to do perturba-
tion theory calculations in a manifestly n = 4 covariant way. the best one can do is reformulate
the theory in terms of o-shell n = 2 harmonic superelds and then apply the existing feynman
graph technique for such superelds.

the two n = 2 ingredients of the n = 4 sym theory are the n = 2 sym multiplet and
the n = 2 matter (hyper)multiplet. both of them can be described as superelds in the
grassmann (g-)analytic superspace [2] with coordinates x 
i are the
harmonic variables which form a matrix of su (2) and parametrise the sphere s2  su (2)/u (1).
a harmonic function f (q)(u) of u (1) charge q is a function of u
invariant under the action of
i
the group su (2) (which rotates the index i of u
i ) and homogeneous of degree q under the action
of the group u (1) (which rotates the index  of u
i ). such functions have innite harmonic
expansions on s2 whose coecients are su (2) tensors (multispinors). the superspace is called
g-analytic since it only involves half of the grassmann variables, the su (2)-covariant harmonic
projections + = u+

a , +, + , u

i . here u

i i, +  = u+

i

i .

in this framework the hypermultiplet is described by a g-analytic supereld of charge +1,
q+(xa, +, +, u) (and its conjugate q+(xa, +, +, u) where  is a special conjugation on s2
preserving g-analyticity). note that this n = 2 supermultiplet cannot exist o shell with a
nite set of auxiliary elds [27]. this only becomes possible if an innite number of auxiliary
elds (coming from the harmonic expansion on s2) are present. on shell these auxiliary elds
are eliminated by the harmonic (h-)analyticity condition (equation of motion)

d++q+ = 0 .

(31)

here d++ is the harmonic derivative on s2 (the raising operator of the group su (2) realised

8

on the u (1) charges, d++u+ = 0, d++u = u+). in the g-analytic superspace it becomes a
supercovariant operator involving spacetime derivatives:

d++ = u+i 

ui  4i+ +  

x 
a

.

the eld equation (31) can be derived from an action given by an integral over the g-analytic
superspace:

shm = z dud4xad2+d2 + q+d++q+ .

(33)

this action is real (with respect to the  conjugation) which can be seen by integrating d++
by parts. in this sense the action (33) resembles the dirac action for fermions, although the
supereld q+ is bosonic.

the sym gauge potential is introduced by covariantising the action (33) with respect to a yang-
mills group with g-analytic parameters (xa, +, +, u). to this end one replaces the harmonic
derivative in (33) by the following covariant one:

d++  ++ = d++ + igv ++(xa, +, +, u)

(34)

where g is the gauge coupling constant. the gauge potential is described by a real (]v ++ =
v ++) g-analytic supereld of charge +2 (equal to the charge of d++). the matter and gauge
superelds are subject to the usual gauge transformations:

q+

= eigq+ , v ++

i
g

= 

eigd++eig + eigv ++eig ,

so that the covariantised action (33)

shm/sym = z dud4xad2+d2 + q+++q+

is indeed gauge invariant.

(35)

(36)

the gauge invariant action for v ++ can be written down in terms of the gauge eld strength
w (xl, i). unlike the g-analytic potential, w is a (left-handed) chiral supereld which is
harmonic-independent, ++w = 0. it can be expressed as a power series in v ++ [28]:

(38)

the details of how to x the gauge and introduce ghosts can be found in [29].

when the hypermultiplet matter is taken in the adjoint representation of the gauge group, the
two actions (36) and (38) describe the n = 4 sym theory,

sn=4 sym = sn=2 sym + shm/sym .

(39)

as mentioned earlier, the main advantage of the n = 2 formulation is the possibility to quantise
the theory in a straightforward way [29].

3in fact, there exists an alternative form given by the right-handed chiral integral r d4xrd4  tr w 2. in a

topologically trivial background the two forms are equivalent (up to a total derivative).

3.2 the reduction formula in n = 2

the main aim of our perturbative calculation is to explicitly show how the general formula used
by intriligator in ref. [13] works. it relates the correlation function of n composite operators to
an (n + 1)-point one where the extra point is obtained by inserting the n = 4 sym lagrangian.
here we shall derive this formula in the context of the n = 2 harmonic superspace formulation
of the n = 4 theory.
consider a set of n composite gauge invariant operators oa, a = 1, . . . , n, each made out of ra
hypermultiplets q+ and sa hypermultiplets q+,

their correlator is given by the functional integral

oa = (q+)ra(q+)sa .

gn = tr ho1 . . . oni =

1

z z dqdv eisn =4 sy m o1 . . . on .

(40)

now we want to dierentiate equation (40) with respect to the coupling constant g. by inspecting
the two ingredients (36) and (38) of the action (39), one sees that, after the change of variables

in the functional integral, the only dependence on g is given by the overall factor g2 in the
n = 2 sym part (38) of the action. thus, we nd

note that throughout the derivation we have used the gauge-invariant sym lagrangian instead
of the gauge-xed one. this is possible since, on the one hand, the composite operators o
are gauge invariant and on the other, the dierence between the two forms of the gauge action
amounts to a gauge (or brst) transformation. so, this formula relates the n-point correlator
of composite hypermultiplet operators to the (n + 1)-point one obtained by inserting the n = 2
sym lagrangian (without the matter part).4

intriligators proposal was to use the formula (42) to try to learn something about the n-point
function by rst predicting (or computing) the (n + 1)-point one. the rst half of the present
paper was devoted to the possibility of predicting such correlators based on their superconformal
properties. now we shall undertake a direct calculation of the right-hand side of eq. (42). we
will deal with the correlation functions of four (two) bilinear composite operators made out of
hypermultiplets and a fth (third) bilinear representing the insertion of the sym lagrangian
into the four (two)-point correlator. after integrating over the insertion point, we will recover
the known results for the four (two)-point correlators of hypermultiplet bilinears. the ve-point
correlator (before integration) is an example of a nilpotent superconformal invariant preserving
harmonic analyticity, but violating the u (1)y invariance of ref. [13].

4in its original version [13] the formula involves a complex coupling constant  . this corresponds to including
the topological part of the sym action with a separate parameter . here we only consider a background of
trivial topology, so our g is real.

10

3.3 graphs and feynman rules

we will be interested in the ve-point correlator

h(q+(1))2(q+(2))2(q+(3))2(q+(4))2 1

4g2 (w (5))2i .

(43)

we want to perform the computation at the lowest non-trivial level of perturbation theory, i.e.,
at two loops. for this reason we do not need to consider non-abelian vertices and can restrict
ourselves to the minimal coupling sym/hm from eq. (36). the non-trivial graph topologies
relevant to the computation are shown in figure 1:

they have been obtained from the corresponding four-point graphs (see [21] for details about
the four-point calculation) by inserting the n = 2 sym linearised lagrangian w 2 into each of
the gluon lines. this amounts to replacing the gluon propagator

the modied sym propagator hw (1)v ++(2)i has one chiral end (the eld strength w (x1l, 1))
and one g-analytic end (the sym potential v ++(x2a, +
2 , u2)). one way to construct it is
to take the standard sym propagator hv ++(1)v ++(2)i in the feynman gauge and convert the
g-analytic end 1 to a chiral one using the linearised version of the expression (37) of the eld
strength w in terms of the potential v ++. however, it is easier to guess the form of this mixed
chiral-g-analytic object based only on its dimension and supersymmetry properties. we recall
that the natural n = 2 superspace for describing (left-handed) chiral objects is the chiral one
with coordinates x 
l , i, and that for g-analytic objects is the grassmann-analytic harmonic
i . 5 the transformation rules of these coordinates
superspace with coordinates x 
5the subscripts of xl and xa refer to the appropriate bases in superspace where chirality or g-analyticity

a , +, + , u

become manifest.

11

under n = 2 supersymmetry are:

chiral superspace:

g-analytic superspace:

l = 4ii 

x 
i = i

i

i (i +  + +i )

a = 4iu
x 
+,  = u+
u
i = 0 .

i i, 

(44)

then, given a chiral point 1 and a g-analytic point 2, we can form the following coordinate
dierences with simple transformation laws:

1l  x 
12 = x 
x 
1  +
12 = u+

12 = 4i
12 = 0 .

12 u

(45)

now, combining these two dierences, one can easily construct a supersymmetric invariant with
all the required properties of the propagator hw (1)v ++(2)i (a lorentz scalar of dimension +1,
chiral at point 1, g-analytic with u (1) charge +2 at point 2):

here a, b are indices of the adjoint representation of the ym group. the coecient has been

v ++(x, , u) = . . . i2(+)2 (x) + i2(+)2(x) + . . . and thus relating hw (1)v ++(2)i to the
standard scalar propagator h (1)(2)i = 1/4i2 x2
12 .

where (12), (12), etc. is a shorthand for contractions of harmonics, e.g., (12) = u+i
2i, (12) =

1 u+
2i. unlike the mixed chiral-analytic one x12 (45), this purely g-analytic dierence is invari-
ant under supersymmetry, x12 = 0. thus, the hypermultiplet propagator (a lorentz scalar of
dimension 2, g-analytic with u (1) charges +1 at both points 1 and 2) can be written down as
follows:

1 u+

-1

b (2)i = ab

once again, the coecient has been xed by examining the isodoublet scalar of the hypermul-
tiplet, q+(x, , u) = f i(x)u+

i + . . . .

6this is the n = 2 analog of the dierence (20).

3.4 building blocks

let us now return to the graphs in figure 1. it is clear that the two topologies in figure 1a,b
can be reduced to products of hypermultiplet propagators and the following three-point building
block:

the interaction point 4 is g-analytic, so one has to integrate over the g-analytic superspace

r du4d4x4ad2+

(47)

it is clear that the nilpotent factor (34)2 serves as a grassmann delta-function which identies
the left-handed g-analytic variable +
3 of the chiral
variable i
3 . this allows us to immediately do the left-handed half of the grassmann integral
at point 4. the easiest way to do the remaining right-handed integration is to make use of the
supersymmetry of the expression in (47). the idea is to shift away the two external g-analytic
variables +, 

4 with the harmonic projection +

by means of a nite supersymmetry transformation:

3/4  u+

(14)1 = (1, 4) of the singular harmonic distribution
1/(14) (see [29] for details). finally, using the properties of the one-loop spacetime integral (see
[30, 21] for a discussion of such integrals), one easily nds

now, we have to recall that the above computation has been done in the special frame where

3/1, +
transformation with the parameter  (49).

give rise to the supersymmetric invariants 31, 32 (see (45)) and the analytic-analytic dierence
x12 becomes the invariant x12 (46). further, the harmonic projections

into 31, 32 (45), e.g.,

in the process the harmonic projections +

whereas the mixed chiral-analytic dierences x31, x32 become supersymmetric invariants with
the help of both g-analytic +

x31;2 = x31 +

note that despite the presence of various nilpotent terms, the invariants x and x still satisfy the
usual cyclic identity

x32;1  x31;2 = x12 .

by means of a supersymmetry transformation one eliminates +
1,2 . thirdly, after shifts of the

3.5 results

at this stage what remains to do is to multiply the above building blocks together with the rel-
evant hypermultiplet propagators and obtain the complete expressions for the ve-point graphs
in figure 1. this involves a lot of elementary algebra, therefore we shall only do it in full detail
in the simpler case of the two-loop three-point correlator

h(q+(1))2(q+(2))2 1

4g2 (w (3))2i .

the corresponding graphs are shown in figure 4:

one sees that they are made out of the same building blocks as before. however, the multipli-
cation in the case of the graph in figure 4a is considerably simplied by the identication of the
end-point s since the two lorentz structures in (58) (the scalar and the antisymmetric tensor)
become orthogonal. thus, this graph produces the expression (up to an overall factor)

clearly, one nds exactly the same result when completing the building block (61) from figure
3 to the graph in figure 4b by multiplying it by a hypermultiplet propagator (12)/x2
12. the
careful computation of the group and combinatorial factors shows that the two contributions

this conrms the absence of quantum corrections to three-point correlators at two loops (see
section 2), other than possible contact terms. concerning the latter, note one subtle point. the
above multiplication of singular distributions of the type 1/x2
12 should be done
with care, using a suitable regularisation scheme. the complete result may then contain contact
terms which are lost in the formal manipulations presented here.

12  1/x2

12 = 1/x4

finally, because of the (purely algebraic) complexity of the calculation of the ve-point correlator
in figure 1 in full generality, we shall do it by setting the external s at the four hypermultiplet
ends to zero, +
1,2,3,4 = 0. the only surviving grassmann variable will be the chiral one i
5
at the point of insertion of the sym lagrangian. in other words, we will only be interested
in the leading component corresponding to the correlator of four bilinears made out of the
hypermultiplet scalars with a fth bilinear composed of the sym scalars. our aim will be to
show that after integrating over the insertion point, one correctly reproduces the known result
for the four-point correlator of [21, 11]. so, multiplying two building blocks of the type (58)
with distinct end points together with some matter propagators, adding to this the graphs made
out of the building block (61) and doing all the necessary permutations, one nds the following
surprisingly simple result:

h(q+(1))2(q+(2))2(q+(3))2(q+(4))2 1

one recognises the chiral grassmann delta-function (5)4 which gives the correlator the required

4 conclusions

the subject of this work has been the explicit construction of nilpotent superconformal covariants
in n = 4 sym theory. in particular, we have used the superconformal ward identities to nd
all two- and three-point contact terms. we have also investigated the existence of such contact
terms for more than three points and we have argued that such terms cannot aect the proof
of the non-renormalisation of two- and three-point function given in [14]. we have also argued,
subject to some assumptions, that all contact terms arise from the addition of a nite local
counterterm to the eective action, namely the superconformal action.

the explicit contact terms which were found in reference [19] followed from non-contact con-
tributions as a result of the ward identities. such contact terms are automatically encoded in
the approach advocated in the works by the authors of this paper. neither in our attempts at
constructing them nor in our application of that formula to an explicit two-loop calculation have
we found evidence for the existence of contact terms of the more malignant type that would
invalidate the non-renormalisation theorem for two and three point functions given in [14].

we have also carried out a two-loop calculation in n = 2 harmonic superspace and as a result
have been able to prove explicitly the existence of a ve-point nilpotent n = 2 superconformal
covariant which in turn strongly suggests the existence of a corresponding n = 4 covariant. if the
multiplication of the building blocks in this calculation is done in full detail (i.e., without setting
+
1,2,3,4 = 0) one arrives at an explicit expression for this ve-point superconformal invariant
which is of the type discussed in [14]. as rst suggested in [13, 33] such new invariants must
exist if the n = 4 harmonic superspace is to be consistent with the known facts about the
greens functions in n = 4 yang-mills theory. these new invariants do however, have the other
general properties postulated in [4, 14]. these properties are harmonic analyticity d++g = 0,
which is evident from (65), and superconformal invariance (which follows from the n = 4 sym
context of the calculation).

in the direct calculation of the four-point correlator carried out in ref.

as a byproduct of this investigation, we have achieved a further signicant simplication in the
calculation of the two-loop four-point correlators of gauge invariant operators rst considered
in [21, 32].
[21] the
fact that all the three harmonic structures in (67) have the same non-trivial dependence on
the conformal cross ratios was not obvious at all. an indirect argument based on conformal
supersymmetry and harmonic analyticity allowed us to establish this relationship in [11]. the
present calculation reproduces it directly, due to the remarkably simple structure of the ve-
point correlator. moreover, in the variant of this calculation presented here the appearance of
any two-loop integrals was completely avoided. this was made possible by the fact that for the
two basic building blocks of our two-loop diagrams, depicted in gs. 2 and 3, the integration over
the internal point can be performed trivially using supersymmetry. this fact is of independent
interest, and may possibly lead to simplications in other contexts.
