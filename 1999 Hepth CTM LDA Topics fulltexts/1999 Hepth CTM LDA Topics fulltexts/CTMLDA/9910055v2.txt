abstract

the two-loop feynman diagram contribution to the four-graviton amplitude of
eleven-dimensional supergravity compactied on a two-torus, t 2, is analyzed in detail.
the schwinger parameter integrations are re-expressed as integration over the moduli
space of a second torus, t 2, which enables the leading low-momentum contribution to be
evaluated in terms of maps of t 2 into t 2. the ultraviolet divergences associated with
boundaries of moduli space are regularized in a manner that is consistent with the ex-
pected duality symmetries of string theory. this leads to an exact expression for terms of
order d4 r4 in the eective m theory action (where r4 denotes a contraction of four weyl
tensors), thereby extending earlier results for the r4 term that were based on the one-loop
eleven-dimensional amplitude. precise agreement is found with terms in type iia and iib
superstring theory that arise from the low energy expansion of the tree-level and one-loop
string amplitudes and predictions are made for the coecients of certain two-loop string
theory terms as well as for an innite set of d-instanton contributions. the contribution
at the next order in the derivative expansion, d6 r4, is problematic, which may indicate
that it mixes with higher-loop eects in eleven-dimensional supergravity.

1. introduction

this paper continues the study of the interconnections between quantum supergrav-
ity in eleven dimensions [1] compactied on t 2 and properties of perturbative and non-
perturbative string theory [2,3]. in earlier papers [4,5,6] it was shown that the one-loop
diagrams of eleven-dimensional supergravity that contribute to certain special amplitudes
reproduce terms in the eective type ii superstring actions that may be described by
integrals over sixteen grassmann components, which is half the dimension of the type
ii superspace. these terms include the r4 term, which is a specic contraction of four
weyl tensors that arises from the leading behaviour in the low energy expansion of the
four-graviton amplitude.

the main objective of this paper is to extend this analysis to the evaluation of
higher-derivative terms in the eective action by considering the low energy expansion of
the two-loop contribution to eleven-dimensional supergravity compactied on t 2. this
seemingly awesome calculation is greatly facilitated by the observation in [7] that the two-
loop amplitude has a surprisingly simple expression as a kinematic factor multiplying a
subset of the two-loop amplitudes of 3 scalar eld theory. this is a generalization of the
well-known structure of the one-loop amplitude.

eleven-dimensional supergravity is only the long wavelength approximation to m
theory and does not by itself dene the short distance physics that is necessary for a
consistent quantum theory. this is evident from the fact that the quantum theory has
non-renormalizable ultraviolet behaviour that can only be consistently interpreted with
additional microscopic input that is not contained in the supergravity theory but should
be built into a detailed microscopic theory, such as the matrix model. however, it was seen
in [4] that if some mild extra information is fed in from string theory the regularized value
of the one-loop divergence in the four-graviton scattering amplitude is uniquely specied.
this mild information is the fact that the type iia and iib superstring theories have
identical one-loop four-graviton amplitudes. similar statements hold for other interactions
of the same dimension that are related to the four-graviton interaction by supersymmetry
[5]. we will see that requiring the various string duality symmetries to hold will also
severely restrict the form of special higher-dimension interactions that arise at two loops
in eleven-dimensional supergravity and contribute higher-derivative terms in the eective
action.

in section 2 we will give a schematic overview of the loop amplitudes of eleven-
dimensional supergravity compactied on a circle and on a two-dimensional torus, and
their correspondence with terms in the string theory eective action. the purpose of this
section is to show how simple dimensional arguments can hint at connections between these
quantum loop amplitudes and the structure of higher-order terms in the eective action
of type ii string theory in nine and ten dimensions. an important point to be discussed
at the end of section 2 is that the four-graviton amplitudes in the ten-dimensional type

1

iia and type iib theories can be shown to be equal up to two loops, even though the
two-loop amplitudes are notoriously dicult to evaluate in closed form. this rather non-
obvious consequence of supersymmetry follows from careful consideration of the eect of
the insertion of world-sheet supermoduli.

in order to compare our results obtained from one and two-loop diagrams of eleven-
dimensional supergravity on t 2 with the corresponding string theory results, we include
an appendix which contains a brief review of the expansion of the four-graviton tree-level
and one-loop string theory amplitudes in a series of derivatives.

section 3 will review the detailed calculation of the one-loop four-graviton amplitude
compactied on t 2 and its contributions to the eective m-theory action, developing the
arguments in [8,9] concerning the momentum dependence. the lowest order term in the
momentum expansion determines the interaction of the form [10],

(1.1)

where g(9) is the nine-dimensional m-theory metric, v is the dimensionless volume of t 2,
 = 1 + i2 is its complex structure and f1(, ) is a modular-function invariant. when
translated into the nine-dimensional type iib string theory parameters the complex struc-
ture is identied with the complex coupling constant where 1 is the ramondramond
(r  r) scalar eld and 2 = eb
, with b the type iib dilaton. the function f1(, )
has a large-2 expansion that begins with two power-behaved terms. these are inter-
preted in string theory as terms that arise from the tree-level string amplitude and from
the one-loop string amplitude. the remainder of f1(, ) consists of an innite sequence
of exponentially suppressed contributions of the form e2(|k|2ik1) which correspond
to d-instanton contributions. the one-loop ultraviolet divergence is cubic in the loop mo-
mentum and has been cut o in (1.1) at a momentum scale  measured in units of l1
11 ,
where l11 is the eleven-dimensional planck length. it was shown in [10] that in order for
(1.1) to be consistent with the equality of the one-loop four-graviton amplitudes in the iia
and iib string theories the cut-o must be set to the value (l11)3 = /2. alternatively,
a local r4 counterterm should be added to the one-loop action with a coecient chosen
to cancel the  dependence and give the appropriate nite value.
the one-loop amplitude compactied on t 2 also contains an innite set of higher-
derivative terms. among these are the non-analytic terms containing the nine-dimensional
massless threshold singularities implied by unitarity which have the symbolic form
ss)1/2 (where s represents any of the mandelstam invariants1). after subtracting this
(l2

theory in the string frame and upper-case letters s, t, u for the corresponding invariants in the

eleven-dimensional theory.

term the loop amplitude can be expanded in a series of powers of the momenta correspond-
ing to higher derivative terms in the eective action [8,9]. these higher-derivative terms
translate into terms in the iia and iib string theory eective actions that have a depen-
dence on the coupling constant that implies that they should be identied with multi-loop
string theory eects. among these terms are contributions of order s2r4 that have the
dilaton dependence of string theory one-loop and two-loop contributions. these terms ap-
parently violate the equality of iia and iib four-graviton amplitudes at two string loops.
however, we will see that the expected equality is restored when two-loop supergravity
eects are added.

section 4 will be concerned with the two-loop supergravity four-graviton amplitude
compactied on t 2, making use of its expression in terms of scalar eld theory [7]. an
important feature of the two-loop and higher-loop contributions is that they have overall
kinematic factors of the form d4r4, so that they do not give extra contributions to the
one-loop r4 term.2 however, it is not known if the d4r4 and d6r4 terms, which get
contributions from both one and two loops in eleven dimensions, are protected from correc-
tions arising from higher-loop diagrams. in a sense, the results of this paper indicate that
the d4r4 terms are completely accounted for by the two-loop contributions and should
therefore not receive higher-order corrections.

we will be interested in the expression for the two-loop amplitude compactied
on t 2 so that each loop is associated with an independent nine-dimensional momentum
integral and a sum over two kaluzaklein momentum components. after performing
the integration over the continuous loop momenta the leading term in the low energy
expansion of the two-loop supergravity amplitude of d4r4 will be expressed as an integral
over three schwinger parameters and a sum over the kaluzaklein charges. this needs
to be regularized in order to suppress the ultraviolet divergences which are of two kinds.
one of these is the two-loop primitive divergence while the second comprises the three
independent sub-divergences that come from the divergences of one-loop sub-diagrams.

in order to describe these divergences in a systematic manner we rst perform poisson
resummations over the kaluzaklein momenta to rewrite the amplitude as a sum over the
windings of the internal lines around t 2 as well as an integral over three loop parameters.
the leading divergence arises, as expected, in the sector of zero winding number while
the one-loop sub-divergences arise in sectors in which a subset of winding numbers vanish.
in order to analyze these sub-divergences we have found it very helpful to make use of a
hidden sl(2, z) symmetry of the two-loop supergravity integrand. this is made explicit
by redening the three loop integration variables to be the volume and complex structure

2 this symbolic notation indicates a term in which there are four (covariant) derivatives and
four factors of the riemann curvature. the precise pattern of index contractions will be specied

later.

of a second two-torus, t 2. the ultraviolet divergences are regularized in a natural manner

that respects the sl(2, z) symmetry by introducing a cuto at the boundaries of the
moduli space of this torus. the evaluation of the loop amplitude then involves mappings

of t 2 into t 2.
in this manner we will be able to evaluate contributions to the eective action that
have the form of a prefactor, which is a function of the moduli, multiplying d4r4. there
is a nite (cuto-independent) contribution to this prefactor that is independent of the
string coupling and is interpreted as a string one-loop contribution. the dependence on
the complex structure of the torus is encoded in a contribution to the prefactor that is again
a modular invariant non-holomorphic eisenstein series. this enters in the sectors that have
one-loop sub-divergences proportional to 3, where  is a momentum cuto. these sub-
divergences are cancelled by additional one-loop four-graviton diagrams in which the one-
loop r4 counterterm (and its supersymmetric partners) is inserted as one of the vertices.
when translated into string theory coordinates the renormalized value of this prefactor
contains equal tree-level, one-loop and two-loop perturbative contributions to the type iia
and iib string theory four-graviton amplitudes. the agreement between these iia and iib
perturbative terms follows from detailed comparison between the one-loop expressions of
section 3 and the two-loop expressions of section 4. the coecients of these terms are also
in precise agreement with the corresponding terms in the expansion of the string tree and
one loop amplitudes given in the appendix.

we will also argue on the basis of string dualities that the leading two-loop divergence
can make no contribution to the d4r4 interaction, which means that its renormalized
value must be set equal to zero. however, it can contribute to the d6r4 interaction
at string tree level. the analysis of the eleven-dimensional two-loop contribution to this
interaction indeed appears to be a mess. this suggests that this interaction may also
receive contributions from higher-loop eects in eleven-dimensional supergravity.

section 5 contains a summary and some concluding comments.

2. higher order terms in eleven-dimensions

the derivative expansion of the m-theory action for the eleven-dimensional theory

is no meaningful perturbative expansion. therefore, we will only be able to make sense of
protected quantities that receive only a nite number of perturbative contributions. the
dimensional ultraviolet cuto is determined in units of the eleven-dimensional planck scale,
l11. upon compactication it will often be convenient to change to the string theory param-
eters, which are given in units of the string scale, ls. compactication on a circle of radius
r11 gives rise to the type iia string theory where the string coupling constant, ga = ea
(where a is the iia dilaton), is given by l11 = (ga)1/3ls and r3

where g is the string frame metric. since the compactication radius r11 depends on the
string coupling constant the kaluza-klein modes are mapped to the massless fundamental
string states and the non-perturbative d0-brane states. when expressed in terms of the
type iia string theory parameters the compactied classical action becomes

more generally, we will be concerned with the compactication of eleven-dimensional
supergravity on t 2. the dictionary that relates v and  to the nine-dimensional type iia
and type iib string theory parameters is [2,3],

respective r  r potentials and a, b are the iia and iib dilatons.

the higher order corrections to the four-graviton interaction in the m-theory eective

where the expansion of the function h summarizes general features of the higher order
corrections to the action. the lowest-order contribution of this type is the r4 term
[10,13,14,15,4], which denotes the familiar contraction between four weyl tensors,

r4  t1...8 t1...8 r1122 . . . r7788 ,

(2.6)

where the tensor t1...8 (r = 0, 1,    , 9) is dened in [16]. in the following we will be
evaluating the scattering amplitude for four on-shell gravitons that contributes to eec-
tive interactions of this type. instead of specifying the precise normalization constant in
(2.6), it will therefore be more useful to dene the linearized version of this interaction in
momentum space, which is given by

in writing the eective action in the form (2.5) it is necessary to rst subtract the
nonlocal threshold terms that arise from integration over the massless intermediate states
in the loop amplitudes. in the nine-dimensional compactication to be considered later
these thresholds generate square root branch points of the form (s)1/2. having subtracted
this behaviour the amplitude has a power series expansion in powers of s, t and u. this
translates into an expansion of the function h in powers of 2, beginning with terms that
we will write symbolically d4 r4, which have the linearized form,
4r4  t1...8 t1...8 (2 2 h11 )(4 4 h33 )4 ((6 6 h55)(8 8 h77)) .
the precise normalization of this term will be relevant later when its contribution to the

(s2 + t 2 + u 2) k.

(2.9)

the possible term of order 2 vanishes by use of the equations of motion (the mass shell
condition s + t + u = 0). there are expected to be higher order non-analytic terms of
the form s3(s)1/2 which will also need to be subtracted before powers of s4 and higher
can be considered. however, the considerations of this paper will cover only the terms of
order s2r4 (together with a few comments about terms of order s3r4) so the higher-order
thresholds will not be relevant.

2.1. one-loop contributions

some of the systematics of the correspondence between the loop calculations of
eleven-dimensional supergravity compactied on a circle or on a two-torus can be un-
derstood from dimensional arguments. for example, the one-loop four-graviton diagram
of g. 1 has dimension (momentum)11 but it actually only diverges cubically with momen-
tum. this follows from the fact that an overall factor of the linearized approximation to
r4 factors out of the amplitude and this prefactor contains eight powers of the external
momenta. after accounting for this prefactor the dynamical part of the loop calculation is
identical to the box diagram of 3 eld theory. importantly, no other diagrams contribute.
in particular, there are no diagrams with vertices corresponding to gravitational contact
interactions. this simplication is a very special feature of the four-graviton amplitude
and other related processes that are protected by supersymmetry [6].

the box diagram can be expressed as a sum over the windings of the world-line of
the particle circulating in the loop, which gives an expression that is the sum of integer
winding numbers around the circle or the two-torus. the term with zero winding num-
ber, which is ultraviolet divergent, does not depend on the geometry of the torus. this
divergence will be regulated by introducing a cuto, 2, on the schwinger parameter
conjugate to the loop momentum which suppresses the ultraviolet domain. this gives a
contribution to the amplitude proportional to 3. the dependence on the cuto can be
cancelled by adding a local r4 counterterm to the action. the sum over non-zero windings
gives a nite contribution which is necessarily proportional to r3
11 which has the dimen-
sions (momentum)3 where, for simplicity, we are considering compactication on a circle.
comparing this to the expected result in the type iia theory, in which r3
, we see
that the nite term is interpreted as a string tree-level eect while the regularized term
(which is independent of ea
) is a string one-loop eect. compactication of the loop on
a two-torus gives a dependence on the modulus of the torus as well as its volume. in the
limit of zero volume the ultraviolet divergent zero winding number term vanishes and the

11 = e2a

7

nite sum over non-zero windings gives the nite result that corresponds to the type iib
string theory.

as will be explained in sub-section 2.3 the four-graviton amplitudes of the iia and
iib string perturbation expansions are equal up to and including two loops. this is not an
automatic property of the eleven-dimensional eld theory calculation but it is true if the
coecient of the counterterm is chosen to have an appropriate value. furthermore, this is
the same value that is required by supersymmetry (based on an indirect argument given
in [10]).

in the next section we will consider terms of higher order in the derivative expansion
that come from the expansion of the one-loop supergravity amplitude in powers of s, t and
u . when compactied on a circle this gives terms in the eective action of the symbolic
form r3n

11 d2n r4, which contribute to the n-loop string action since r3

new primitive divergences arise at each order in perturbation theory. for example,
the two-loop feynman diagrams contributing to the four-graviton amplitude in eleven-
dimensional supergravity have the supercial degree of divergence 20. however, the
amplitude has an expansion in powers of derivatives acting on r4 so there are at least eight
powers of the external momenta, reducing the naive divergence to 12, or less (depending on
the number of derivatives). according to [7] at two loops there is also an additional factor
of s2 (or t 2 or u 2) so that the naive two-loop divergence is 8, which is the same as that
of 3 scalar eld theory. more generally, at n loops there is a new primitive divergences of
the form 9n10s2r4. from the work of [7] it is not yet clear whether extra overall powers
of s, t and u arise beyond two loops which would reduce the naive degree of divergence
still further (although it seems unlikely that there will be a simple expression for higher

8

loops in terms of 3 eld theory). these ultraviolet divergences come from the sector in
which all winding numbers vanish and are independent of the geometry of the compactied
dimensions. their cuto dependence can therefore be subtracted by the inclusion of local
counterterms proportional to powers of derivatives acting on four powers of the curvature
(as in g. 2(c)). in [7] the two-loop amplitude was evaluated by dimensional regularization,
which picks out the logarithmically divergent term. this arises from the nite part of a
term of the (symbolic) form s62 r4 / in 11   dimensions. likewise, the diagram will
contribute non-analytic threshold terms at order s6. dimensional regularization discards
the power divergences that have lower powers of s, which are precisely the terms we are
interested in this paper.

in translating to string theory we must use the relations between the string theory

mandelstam invariants, s, t and u, and those of eleven-dimensional supergravity,

s = s

t = t

(2.10)

where the presence of the inverse powers of r11 results from the inverse metric in the
denition of the invariants (s = g (k1 + k2)(k1 + k2), t = g (k1 + k4)(k1 + k4),
u = g (k2 + k4)(k2 + k4)).

as in the case of one-loop diagrams the eects of the internal propagators winding
around the compact direction(s) leads to dependence on the geometry of the compact
dimensions. in this case these eects arise both in nite terms as well as in terms that
contain sub-divergences. for example, g.2(a) shows an example of a two-loop supergravity
diagram which has dimension (momentum)20. after accounting for the twelve powers
of the external momenta in the overall s2 r4 factor eight powers of momenta remain
that must be replaced either by powers of  or appropriate powers of the dimensional
parameters, (r11)1 and s = s/r11, t = t /r11, or u = u/r11. when compactied on a
circle of radius r11 this will contribute to the string tree level amplitude if it is proportional
to (r11)3. there are therefore two possible kinds of term that contribute at tree level,
namely, terms of the form,

k1

(2.11)

(2.12)

where k1 and k2 are constants. the second of these terms does not depend on the cuto
and is a nite contribution whereas the rst term results from the one-loop sub-divergences.
these sub-divergences are cancelled by including the one-loop diagram of g. 2(b), in
which the vertex indicated by the dot is the local r4 counterterm that was extracted from

9

the one-loop diagram and has a coecient that depends on the cuto. since the particles
circulating in the loop include all components of the supermultiplet, the supersymmetric
partners of the r4 vertices are also involved. these couple the two external gravitons
to two internal third-rank antisymmetric tensors, or two gravitini, in addition to two
internal gravitons. in practice, this complication will be avoided since we will nd that the
consistency of the renormalization procedure requires g. 2(b) to be given in terms of scalar
eld theory in the same manner as the other one-loop and two-loop diagrams. this makes
the diagram very easy to evaluate. its dimension of (momentum)17 is accounted for by the
cuto-independent factor r3
11 (s/r11)2 r4 that has the same form as (2.11). the sum of
this diagram and (2.11) should give a specic overall coecient that is independent of the
cuto. in fact, we will see from the explicit calculations in section 4 that the coecient of
the d4 r4 term is proportional, in the type iib limit, to e5/2(, ), which is the natural
modular invariant completion of the tree-level term (2.11). as anticipated, the overall
coecient is precisely determined by requiring that the type iia and type iib string loop
amplitudes are equal (up to two loops).

the status of the s3 r4 term (2.12) will not be resolved in this paper. it seems likely
that a complete understanding will have to take into account higher-loop supergravity
contributions. this is one of many complications in understanding in detail the systematics
of the correspondence between the higher-loop supergravity diagrams and string diagrams.
whereas the r4 and related terms of the same dimension are integrals over half the
superspace, terms with more derivatives are formally integrals over a higher fraction of
the superspace. each power of momentum is equivalent to two powers of  so that terms
with less than eight powers of momentum acting on r4 should be protected and may be
determined in this manner. this includes the s3 r4  d6 r4 term which should therefore
also be determined by similar considerations. whether it is possible to go beyond this and
relate terms in string perturbation theory at higher order in the momentum expansion to
eleven-dimensional supergravity is much less obvious.

2.3. comparison of type iia and iib perturbation expansions.

an important constraint on the structure of the results of the eleven-dimensional
calculations that we will make use of is a relationship between the type iia and iib four-
graviton scattering amplitudes that holds up to and including two loops.

it is well known that the tree-level and one-loop four-graviton amplitudes of the type
iia and type iib superstring theories are identical (ignoring the parity-violating part of the
loop amplitude, which vanishes in topologically trivial backgrounds). this property, which
is also true for compactications, is not an obvious consequence of the duality symmetries.
for example, t-duality (which applies to all orders in perturbation theory as well as non-
perturbatively) only identies the two theories when one is compactied on a circle and
the other on the inverse circle, whereas we are comparing the theories on circles of the

10

same radius (which may, for example, be innite). the question is how far this generalizes
to higher genus diagrams, which have not been explicitly evaluated? such equality can be
seen by considering the explicit construction of the four-graviton loops in the two theories.5
recall that the type iib theory diers from that of the type iia by a ip of sign in
the gso projection for the odd spin structure of the left-moving fermions while the right-
moving fermions have identical gso projections. therefore, loop amplitudes with external
gravitons, or any other massless states in the n s n s sector, dier only in the sign of the
odd-odd spin structures  those spin structures that are odd both in the left-moving and
in the right-moving sectors (we will again ignore the odd-even spin structures which vanish
in the topologically trivial backgrounds that we are considering). consider the scattering
of gravitons with momenta k(r)
 = 0, and polarization
vectors h(r)
r r which can be written in terms of left-moving and right-moving vectors a
h(r)
. for genus l  1 these terms are associated with the product of two
epsilon tensors, 0...9 0...9. the tensor indices can contract with the three independent
external momenta, the left-moving and right-moving vectors in the polarization tensors or
with each other. at one loop there are no contractions between the two epsilon tensors
so the odd-odd spin structures vanish and the two theories are identical. at higher loops
there are insertions of 2l  2 supermoduli associated with picture changing. each one of
these inserts a factor of x  x  which leads to a total of two contractions of the form 
between the two epsilon tensors. this is still not enough to allow the sixteen remaining
indices of these tensors to be saturated by the external momenta and polarizations. when
l > 2 there are more contractions between the epsilon tensors due to the higher number
of picture changing operators, in which case the odd-odd spin structures give a non-zero
contribution. we conclude, therefore, that:

the four-graviton amplitudes in the type iia and iib superstring theories are equal up to

two loops, but not beyond.

a corollary is that amplitudes with ve external gravitons are not equal at two loops while
those with more gravitons are not equal at one or two loops.

3. momentum dependence of the one-loop supergravity amplitude

the one-loop amplitude describing the elastic scattering of two gravitons in eleven-

dimensional minkowski space is given by [4],

and q ( = 0,    , 10) is the eleven-dimensional loop momentum. the numerical coecient
in (3.1) follows the conventions of [7] (with a slight reshuing of the powers of (2)11)
which will be convenient for later consideration of two-loop diagrams.

we want to consider this amplitude compactied on m 9t 2 so that two components
of the loop momentum are proportional to integer kaluzaklein charges (l1 and l2). for
simplicity, we will choose a kinematic conguration in which the external gravitons have
their polarizations and momenta oriented in directions transverse to the two-torus. after
representing the propagators as integrals of schwinger parameters in the usual manner the
compactied version of (3.2) can be written as

come from integration over the two remaining regions, tt u : 0  3  2  1  1 and

it converges and then analytically continued to the physical region. the amplitude can be
split into a momentum-dependent and a momentum-independent part

2(2s)es = x(m,n)6=(0,0)

|m + n|2s .

(3.10)

the volume-dependence, v 3/2, of this term means that it vanishes in the eleven-
dimensional limit, v  . however, this is the only term that survives in the limit
that corresponds to the decompactied type iib theory, rb   with xed eb
, while the
cuto dependent term in (3.7) gives vanishing contribution. the complex structure of t 2
is to be identied with the complex iib scalar eld,  = 1 + i2. expanding e3/2 for
large 2 (small type iib coupling, eb

) gives

2(3)e 3

= 2(3)e3b/2 +

22

eb /2 + non  perturbative.

(3.11)

the successive terms in this expansion can be identied with tree-level, one-loop, and
non-perturbative terms in the coecient of the type iib string theory r4 interaction. the
non-perturbative terms have the form of an innite series of d-instanton terms where each
charge-k d-instanton contribution has an innite series of perturbative uctuations.

13

the total one-loop contribution to the amplitude comes from the combination io+io
(the sum of (3.9) and (3.7)). the dominant term in the large-v limit is proportional to
(4(l11)3/3 + c1) and is independent of v so in the string theory parameterization this
term is independent of the dilaton and arises from one string loop in the type iia theory.
although this coecient is not determined by the physics of quantized eleven-dimensional
supergravity, it is determined by insisting that the four-graviton interactions in the type
iia and type iib eective string actions should be equal when the radii ra and rb are
equal. as argued in section 2.3 this is known property of string perturbation theory up to
and including two loops. more explicitly, the nine-dimensional eective actions that give
rise to the momentum independent part of i + io have r4 terms that are expressed as

(3.14)

this is the value which is also consistent with supersymmetry [10].

the momentum dependence of i(s, t ) in (3.4) is contained in the nite term i (s, t )
in (3.5). we will separate the term with zero kaluzaklein momenta, i 0(s, t ) (l1 = l2 =

i (s, t ) = i 0(s, t ) +

there is no n = 1 term after adding the contributions of i(s, u ) and i(t, u ) to i(s, t )
since the linear symmetric combination vanishes after using the mass shell condition.

the non-analytic term (3.18) in nine-dimensional m-theory comes from the same
massless thresholds that arise in either nine-dimensional type ii string theory [9,8] and
have square root branch cuts of the form (s)1/2.

the two innite series of terms on the right-hand side of (3.21) have very obvious
origins from the dimensional reduction of the massless one-loop normal threshold of the
eleven-dimensional loop. the rst innite series is a series of ascending powers of r10.
although such terms appear to give singular behaviour in the ten-dimensional iia decom-
pactication limit, r10  , the series actually sums up to give the correct threshold
behaviour of the ten-dimensional theory, schematically of the form s ln(s). more explic-
itly, the sum gives

invariants, (2.10). both (3.18) and (3.26) have imaginary parts corresponding to the

massless normal thresholds determined by unitarity. however, the real parts, which might

have given rise to arbitrary constants, are here xed to precise values.

in addition to the threshold term (3.26), the tree-level part of io also survives the limit
r10   in the type iia amplitude, but the d-instanton terms are innitely suppressed
and disappear.

the second series of terms on the right-hand side of (3.21) is an ascending series of
powers of r11. in the ten-dimensional decompactication limit, r10  , this sums to a
series of massive logarithmic thresholds of the ten-dimensional theory,

this is a series of thresholds for the massive kaluzaklein states of m-theory on a circle

sum can be evaluated in the decompactication limit r11   by approximating r/r11
by a continuous variable. including the massless threshold term (3.26), the sum reduces

the innite series of terms in the iia theory are related by t-duality to the series
in the iib theory. however, these terms appear asymmetrically between the two theories
in (3.29) and (3.30). in particular, all the terms in the series in the iib action vanish in
the limit rb   which is not true for the iia series in the iia decompactication limit.
since we saw in section 2.3 that the four-graviton amplitudes in the iia and iib string
theories are identical up to and including the contributions from two string loops there
must be some more contributions that correct for this asymmetry. we will be concerned
particularly with the n = 2 terms on the right-hand side of the iia action in (3.29),

the expression (3.32) has a dependence on the dilaton that is characteristic of contribu-
tions in iia string theory at one and two loops. since the type iia and type iib string
perturbation theories are identical up to two loops these iia terms must be matched by
identical terms in the iib theory (with ra  rb and a  b). we will see in the next
section that these missing contributions to the iib action arise from the compactication
of two-loop terms in eleven-dimensional supergravity.

4. the two-loop supergravity amplitude

the evaluation of two-loop amplitudes in eleven-dimensional quantum supergravity
would normally be a formidable task. however, it is known from the work of [7] that the
two-loop four-graviton amplitude in maximally supersymmetric supergravity continues to
have the feature that it can be written in terms of scalar eld theory diagrams. the
fact that the two-loop amplitude has such a simple expression was motivated in [7] in
dimensions  10 by use of the kawaillewelyntye (klt) rules for constructing closed-
string amplitudes out of open-string amplitudes [17]. this was shown to imply that the
two-loop amplitude in the low energy supergravity theory in d dimensions with maximum
supersymmetry is given in terms of the two-loop amplitude of supersymmetric yangmills
theory with maximal supersymmetry. these rules were then independently derived by
using unitarity in all channels. in eleven dimensions supergravity is not the low energy
limit of a string theory so the strategy for determining the two-loop amplitude has to
be a little dierent. in that case the expression may be determined by the requirement
of unitarity and can also be checked by the requirement that it reduce to the lower-
dimensional expressions upon trivial dimensional reduction.

the result is that the two-loop four-graviton amplitude, a(2)

4 (s, t, u ), is given in
terms of the sum of particular diagrams of 3 scalar eld theory illustrated in g. 3. these
are the planar diagram, i p (s, t ), and the non-planar diagram, i np (s, t ), together with
the other diagrams obtained by permuting the external particles. the complete expression

(4.1)

where perms signies the sum of terms with permutations of s, t and u . this expression
has an overall factor of r4 together with four powers of the momentum multiplying the
loop integrals which means that these diagrams are much less divergent than they would
naively appear. the loop integrals are given by

i p (s, t ) =z d11pd11q

(4.3)

which have ultraviolet divergences of order (momentum)8 that will need to be regularized.
in addition to these two-loop diagrams there is a contribution to the amplitude from
the one-loop diagram of g. 2(b), which is a triangle diagram in which there is one insertion
of the linearized one-loop counterterm. together with two-loop counterterm of g. 2(c),
this will give an additional contribution, a(2)

4 , to the amplitude.

4.1. evaluation of the two-loop amplitude on t n

we shall now consider the leading contribution to the derivative expansion arising
from these two-loop diagrams when compactied on t 2. as discussed earlier, this will
contribute to the d4r4 interaction. for convenience our considerations will be restricted to
situations in which the polarization tensors and momenta of the gravitons are in directions
transverse to torus and covariantize the nal result. we will rst be slightly more general
and consider the case of compactication on an n-torus t n with metric gij and volume
vn, in which case the planar diagram with external momenta kr r = 1, . . . , 4 is given by
the expression,

every value of mi , ni when   0, which requires at least two of the parameters , ,  to
approach zero simultaneously. the sums contribute additional divergences, which makes
this representation of the amplitude rather awkward to analyze.

as in the case of the one-loop amplitude it is convenient to analyze the divergences
after performing a poisson resummation over the kaluzaklein modes, mi , ni, which trans-
forms them into winding numbers, mi , ni, and also to redene the schwinger parameters

and is a function of the winding numbers. the parameters ,  and  will be referred to
as winding parameters. the classication of the divergences is simplied in the winding
number basis. for example, the sector in which all the winding numbers vanish diverges at
the end-point where all of the winding parameters reach their upper limits. this term is
independent of the metric gij and is the primitive two-loop divergence. there are many
sectors that contribute to subleading divergences. the simplest examples are those sectors
in which the winding numbers conjugate to a particular winding parameter vanish.
in
those cases the integral diverges at the endpoint where that parameter reaches its upper
limit, which gives a sub-leading divergence. for example, the  integral diverges in the
ni = 0 sector and behaves as 3 if  is cut o at the value 2 (that was introduced in order
to cut o the one-loop winding parameter). sectors with less than n vanishing winding
numbers give non-divergent contributions which are independent of any cuto.

a more complete analysis of the divergences is greatly facilitated by the observation
that the integrand possesses a secret sl(2, z) symmetry that is not at all apparent in the
, ,  parameterization. this symmetry is made manifest by redening the integration
variables in (4.15) so that the parameters, ,  and , are replaced by the dimensionless
volume, v , and complex structure,  = 1 + i2, of a two-torus, t 2, dened by

it is easy to see how the domain of integration of the schwinger

over [0, ] and the domain of integration of  is the fundamental domain of the 0(2)

in writing the integral (4.20) we have used the fact that the integrand is invariant under
sl(2, z) transformations to equate it to three times the integration over a single copy of
f . this invariance of the integrand can be seen by checking its transformations under t
and s (with v being inert) which have a simple interpretation in terms of the original
winding parameters. the t transformation is given by

(4.22)

(4.23)

the divergences of the loop amplitude are particularly easy to classify in terms of
integration over  and v (4.20). the leading and subleading divergences arise from two
distinct kinds of boundaries of the integration domain.

(i): the leading divergence arises from the limit v   with arbitrary xed values
of 1 and 2. we will regulate this by cutting o the upper limit at a value v = v c = a 2l2
11
(where a is an arbitrary constant) so that the amplitude is proportional to 8. this is the
two-loop primitive divergence which comes from the region in which the loop momenta
are simultaneously of order  and corresponds to the region in which all three schwinger
parameters approach their lower end-points.

(ii): the three distinct kinds of subleading ultraviolet divergences arise from the
region in which 2   with v xed, together with the sl(2, z) images of this region
obtained by the action of s and t s. these are the divergences which arise when one of
the winding parameters approaches its upper limit, which is cut o at . from (4.17) this

7 which are the translation t :    + 1 and the inversion s:   1/ .

24

translates into a cuto on the upper 2 limit at  c
complex structure is integrated over the restricted fundamental domain,

2 = 2l2

11v 1, which means that the

f c

2

= { 1

2  1  1

2 , 2   c

2 ,  2

1 +  2

2  1}.

(4.24)

it is easy to see that this includes all the sub-divergences, as follows. when 2 reaches
its upper limit with xed v , both  and  approach zero while  becomes innite. this
translates, via (4.13), into the region in which  and  vanish, which corresponds to the
ultraviolet sub-divergence at which q2  . similarly, the image under s of this limit
is the boundary at 1 = 0, 2 = 0 which corresponds to the sub-divergence at which
(p + q)2  . the image under t s is the boundary at 1 = 1, 2 = 0 which corresponds
to the sub-divergence at which p2  .

we will now see how this description of the divergences is particularly well adapted
to compactication on a toroidal target space since cases (i) and (ii) arise from distinct
classes of sl(2, z) orbits in the mapping of t 2 into t 2.
4.2. compactication on t 2

when the eleven-dimensional two-loop amplitude is compactied on a two-torus (n =
2) of volume v and complex structure  the exponential factor (4.16) can be written as

ew = vv

22 |(1 )a( 1)|2  2vv det(a) ,

(4.25)

where we have used the usual formula for the metric on a two-torus,

gij mi mj = l2

11v | m1 + m2|2

2

,

(4.26)

and dened a 2  2 matrix a with integer entries.

in this case the expression (4.20) becomes

i p +np (0) =

2(2,2)(v, ; v,  ).

2

(4.27)
this expression can be analyzed by splitting it into orbits for the right action of sl(2, z)
on  . there are three classes of orbits:

(i) singular orbits are ones with a = 0. by inspection, it is clear that these give the
leading divergent contributions which are proportional to 8 from the boundary
v = v c = a l2

112.

25

(ii) degenerate orbits are those for which deta = 0. in this case a can be transformed to

l

the form a =(cid:18) 0

0 k(cid:19) by a sl(2, z) transformation that maps the fundamental do-

main to the strip. again, by inspection these can be seen to give the sub-divergences
proportional to 3.

(iii) non-degenerate orbits are ones with non-singular a. an sl(2, z) transformation,
that maps the fundamental domain to the upper-half complex plane, can be used

to put a in the form a = (cid:18) m j

0 n(cid:19) where 0  j  m  1 , m > 0 and n 6= 0

[18,19]. the non-degenerate orbits are the ones that contribute to the nite part of
the two-loop integral after the divergent terms have been subtracted out. since the
string coupling constant appears in  both the degenerate and the non degenerate
cases will contribute to perturbative and non-perturbative string eects.

the singular term (i) comes from the zero winding number sector and does not depend
on the shape of the torus. a term of the same form also arises by adding a local two-
loop counterterm proportional to s2 r4 to the eective action. we will argue later that
consistency with string perturbation theory actually requires this renormalized coecient
of this interaction to vanish.

in order to extract the remaining contributions it is useful to rst consider the action

of the laplace operator  = 42

2   on the expression (4.27) using the identity,

it follows that

i(v, ) =

2  (cid:0)2(2,2)(cid:1) =  (cid:0)2(2,2)(cid:1) .

(4.34)

the rst term, which has an undetermined value, is the leading regularized divergence
and arises from the singular orbits. its coecient is modied by the addition of the two-
loop s2 r4 counterterm with coecient c2. the second term in (4.34) is the contribution
of the degenerate orbits. this has a -dependent coecient to which must be added the
contribution that comes from g. 2(b) which includes the eect of the one-loop counterterm.
as will be seen in section 4.3 the combined coecient is consistent with the equality of
the iia and iib string theory one-loop and two-loop amplitudes.

the term if in in (4.34) is independent of the cuto and is the nite term that
comes from the non-degenerate orbits and must satisfy  if in = 0 . it can be evaluated
explicitly using the unfolding trick. this allows one of the innite sums in (4.27) to be
used to rewrite the  integral over f as an integral over the upper-half  plane. this is
similar to the analysis in [19], from which the result can be extracted in the form

the sum of the contributions to the amplitude from g. 2(b) and g. 2(c) will be

corresponds to g. 2(b) and is propor-
tional to the one-loop counterterm so it has an overall factor of c1, which has the value
given by (3.14). the direct evaluation of this process would require a complicated sum
over the dierent types of particles circulating in the loop. however, it is easy to check
that the prescription of [7] for expressing the one-loop and two-loop supergravity diagrams
in terms of scalar eld theory feynman rules generalizes to diagrams of this type, giving,

(4.39)

the normalization in (4.38) can be obtained as a simple consequence of unitarity.

the evaluation of the integral (4.39) compactied on t 2 follows closely the discussion
in section 3 of the box diagram. the only dierence is that in this case there are only
three internal propagators. the result is

(4.40)

the cuto-dependent term comes from the zero winding sector, and upon inserting (4.40)
in (4.38), contributes a term proportional to 8 to the v-independent part of the amplitude.
its coecient will be absorbed into a redenition of the coecient a of the leading two-loop
divergence in (4.34). the -dependent part of (4.40) has the same form as the 3 sub-
divergences of the two-loop amplitude in (4.34). after adding these two contributions and
substituting the value of c1 from (3.14) the net dependence on the cuto cancels, leaving
a specic nite contribution that will be discussed in the following subsection.

the contribution to 2a(2)

4.4. comparison of eleven-dimensional supergravity and type ii string theories.

we now turn to the comparison of the results of the eleven-dimensional calculations
to those of the type ii string theories. we will check that the normalization of the nite
s2 r4 term (4.37) has precisely the value that is needed for the perturbative type iia and
iib string theories to be equal at the order of one string loop. furthermore, the value
of the one-loop counterterm, (3.14), will also be seen to lead to the equality of the iia
and iib string tree-level and two-loop terms. this strongly supports the impression that
the two-loop contribution to s2 r4 does not get further contributions from higher-order
feynman diagrams.
in order to compare our two-loop supergravity results with string theory it is nec-
essary to carefully specify our conventions. in either of the two string theories the four-
graviton ampitude has the expansion at tree-level and one loop,

(4.47)

now we can use t-duality to replace the last term in (4.47), which has the dilaton
dependence of a string one-loop term, by its iib equivalent, which is proportional to r2
b
and is also identied as a one-loop string contribution. using the fact that the two string
theories have identical four-graviton loop amplitudes (up to two loops) we must identify this
term with the term in parentheses in (4.45) that is proportional to r2
a (which was deduced
from a one-loop eect in eleven-dimensional supergravity). gratifyingly the coecients of
these terms are indeed equal (using (4) = 4/90) which appears to be a rather nontrivial
check on our calculation. similarly, we can check that the renormalized value for the
subleading divergences respects this symmetry between the iia and iib theories since the
term proportional to e2a
in (4.45) has the same coecient as the term proportional to
e2a
in (4.47). now we can check the consistency further by comparing the coecient
of the tree-level term proportional to (5)e2a
s2r4 in (4.47) with the coecient of the
tree-level term proportional to (3)e2a
r4 in (4.45). these coecients agree with the
coecients deduced from the expansion of the four-graviton tree amplitude reviewed in
the appendix.

we also need to consider the value of the leading divergent contribution to the s2 r4
interaction which arises from the loop amplitudes combined with the two-loop counterterm
with coecient c2 and is independent of the parameters of the two-torus. translating into
11 s2 r4 = e4a/3 s2 r4
iia string theory coordinates this gives the term proportional to r2
in (4.47) which is not proportional to an integer power of e2a
. therefore, it cannot
possibly arise in string perturbation theory, which means that its coecient must vanish,
i.e.

(4.48)
a consequence of this is that the d4 r4 interaction vanishes in the decompactication
limit, r11   so there is no d4r4 interaction in the eleven-dimensional theory.

c2 + a(l11)8 = 0.

5. conclusion

in earlier work the r4 interaction in the eective action for eleven-dimensional m the-
ory compactied on t 2 was obtained by evaluating one-loop feynman diagrams. although
the dependence on the complex structure was uniquely determined by this supergravity
calculation, in order to pin down the value of the one-loop counterterm it was necessary
to input the extra information that the four-graviton amplitudes in type iia and type iib
superstring theories are equal at one string loop.

in this paper we have generalized these statements to obtain the exact scalar eld
dependence of the coecient of the s2 r4 interaction based on consideration of two-loop
feynman diagrams for four-graviton scattering in eleven-dimensional supergravity. using
the value of the one-loop counterterm determined from the one-loop analysis, we have
found that the renormalized value of the two-loop amplitude is

where the second equality expresses the amplitude in type iib parameters, recalling from
(2.9) that d4r4 is a symbolic way of representing the contraction of covariant derivatives
and curvature tensors that gives rise to the kinematic factor (s2 + t 2 + u 2) k in the
four-graviton scattering amplitude.

the term in parentheses in (5.1) that is independent of  matches a corresponding
term that arises in the type iia parameterization from the one-loop supergravity amplitude
in (3.32). it should be easy to evaluate the string one-loop amplitude in nine dimensions
and check the coecient of this term. we saw in section 3 that terms of this type, which
appear to be singular in the decompactication limit, rb  , sum up to form the
appropriate massless threshold singularity in ten dimensions. the dependence on the
complex structure of the torus (the scalar eld of the iib theory) is contained entirely
in the modular function e5/2(, ) which survives the decompactication limit to the
ten-dimensional type iib theory. this term has an expansion in the coupling eb
that
begins with a tree-level term followed by a two-loop term and then an innite series of
d-instanton contributions. we have seen that this is consistent with the little that is
known from string perturbation theory  the tree-level coecient agrees with the string
tree calculation reviewed in the appendix and the one string loop contribution to the s2 r4
interaction in ten dimensions is absent as it should be according to [20]. however, since
no two-loop string amplitudes have yet been evaluated, the value we have obtained for the
s2 r4 interaction at two string loops is not yet tested (although precise two-loop string

31

calculations are feasible in principle [21]). the same is true for the innite sequence of
d-instanton contributions to this interaction.

although we saw in the last section that the s2 r4 term cannot contribute to the
eleven-dimensional theory in the decompactication limit, v  , the next term in the
derivative expansion of the two-loop amplitude may. this is the term of the form s3 r4
which translates in type iia string parameters to a term of the form e2a
s3 r4 which
would be a string two-loop eect. when v is nite there are other supergravity two-loop
contributions to the prefactor multiplying s3 r4 which come from the expansion of the
planar and nonplanar diagrams, (4.10) and (4.11), to linear order in s, t and u . the
resulting expressions do not possess modular invariant integrands when expressed in terms
of the integration variables v and  and we have not made sense of the integrals. this
suggests that extra contributions from higher-loop supergravity amplitudes are needed to
give the full form of the prefactor. since there are good dimensional arguments to expect
this prefactor to be determined by supersymmetry it would be of interest to disentangle
these contributions.
