general, (8) says a(r) = a(r) 4k + 3 dimensions a(r) = a(r) 4k + 1 dimensions. hence a(adj) = 0 present case. gauge bosons modify chern-simons coecient already noted witten {$9802109$}. moreover, since members (64, 175, ) spin 1 towers {$9711200$} real representations, also dont modify chern-simons action. thus see gauge boson loops modify magnitude chern- simons action, spinor loops do. due
