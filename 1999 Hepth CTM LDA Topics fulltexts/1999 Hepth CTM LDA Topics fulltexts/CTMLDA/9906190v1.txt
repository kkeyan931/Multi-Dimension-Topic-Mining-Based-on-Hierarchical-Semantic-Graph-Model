m5-branes, special lagrangian submanifolds

abstract

we study m-theory vebranes wrapped on special lagrangian submanifolds (n) in

calabi-yau three- and fourfolds. when the m5 wraps a four-cycle, the resulting theory is a

two-dimensional domain wall embedded in three-dimensional bulk with four supercharges.

the theory on the wall is specied in terms of the geometry of the cy manifold and

the cycle 4.
gravitational chern-simons terms with a coecient that jumps when crossing the wall

it is chiral and anomalous, however the presence of a three-dimensional

allows to cancel the anomaly by inow. kahler manifolds of special type, where the

potential depends only on the real part of the complex coordinate, are shown to emerge as
the target spaces of two-dimensional -models when the m5 is wrapped on 3  s1, thus
providing a physical realization of some recent symplectic construction by hitchin.

1. introduction and summary

calibrated geometries [1] (see also [2,3]) have been studied in the context of mirror

symmetry [4,5] and intersecting branes (see e.g. [6] for a review and references). our focus

is on special lagrangian (sl) submanifolds in calabi-yau three- and fourfolds, and we

mostly concentrate on the deformation properties of these submanifolds.

we study a class of two-dimensional -models originating from m -theory vebranes

wrapped on four-manifolds. fivebranes wrapped on holomorphic divisors in a calabi-

yau threefold were a subject for recent investigation [7,8]. here we turn to the case of

m5 wrapped on sl four-cycles, when m theory is compactied on a calabi-yau fourfold.

while the amount of supersymmetry can be gured out by general arguments [9], the actual

counting of the multiplets is somewhat involved. such a counting was done for a (very
ample) divisor p in a cy threefold, in [7]. the geometry of the resulting (0, 4) -model was
discussed in detail in [8]. the understanding of cases with lower supersymmetries, arising

when m5 and d5 are wrapped on a sl four-cycle in a calabi-yau four-fold, requires

some results from mcleans deformation theory [10]. recent symplectic constructions by

hitchin also enter in a natural way [11,12]. indeed, there is a natural extension to the

symplectic case of many results on deformations of complex submanifolds, and thus some

of the results of [7,8] (where the submanifold was taken to be a divisor in a cy threefold)

can be extended as well. our study shows yet another aspect of the intimate relation

between calibrated geometries and supersymmetry. even though the main focus of our

attention is on sl submanifolds, other calibrations can be studied along similar lines.

the wrapped vebranes and the resulting -models are our main concern, but it

should be noted that the study of cycles is relevant for d-brane moduli spaces, in par-

ticular instanton eects in type iib (f -theory) compactications when the d3-branes are

completely wrapped. the wrapping of d3-branes on supersymmetric cycles in four-folds

was considered in [13], and for the case of sl submanifolds such congurations were shown

to preserve half of supersymmetry.

in principle, there are few -models obtained by m5 wrapping sl submanifolds in

four-folds. the summary is presented in the table (xn denotes a (complex) n-fold of

su (n) holonomy, while k denotes a sl cycle of real dimension k):

in this note, we discuss only the multiplet structure and the classical target spaces.

in cases with lower supersymmetries that are discussed here these will not be protected

against quantum corrections and there can be world-sheet renormalizations.

first, we will analyze the cases where the submanifolds are complex concentrating on
the fourfolds with su (4) holonomy1. before going into details of the multiplet structure,

we can have a look at the eld content after the reduction. as in the case of [8] the

target space classically factorizes into two sectors, the universal and the entropic (to

borrow the terminology from [8]). the universal sector consists of two real scalars, one

coming from the coordinate parametrizing the position of the m5 in three dimensional

spacetime and one coming from the component of the -eld along the kahler form (this

will be better explained in section 2). in the entropic sector the two sources for the two-

dimensional scalar elds are the self-dual tensor eld on the vebrane worldvolume, and
the deformations of the cycle c inside the calabi-yau. the position of the cycle inside
the fourfold is parametrized by the four (out of ve) scalars in the (0, 2) tensor multiplet

on the vebrane worldvolume. after the reduction these will yield dc real scalars on the
world-sheet (the notation will be justied shortly). the self-dual -eld gives rise to b+
2 and
b
2 right- and left-movers respectively (we have already mentioned that one of the scalars
coming from the  eld belongs to the universal sector). the excess of left-movers tells

us that the resulting -model is of heterotic type, and there is a coupling to a gauge eld.

the numbers of right- and left-moving fermions are given by the twisted dirac index. a

very quick analysis of the multiplets reveals the connection between supersymmetry and

mcleans deformation theory [10]: it is required by supersymmetry (simply by boson-
fermion matching) that the rst betti number of the submanifold b1(c) = dimh 1(c, ir)
be equal to the dimension of the moduli space of deformations of c inside x, dc. indeed
it is known that the tangent space of the local moduli space at c of special lagrangian

1 k3  k3 compactications can be discussed as a special case.

2

submanifolds can be canonically identied with the space of harmonic one-forms on c [10].
this identication is crucial for the supersymmetry of the two-dimensional -model. the

idea of using supersymmetry transformations to give a physical derivation of mcleans

deformation theorems was explained to us by j. harvey and g. moore.

since the resulting two-dimensional theory is chiral, it can suer from anomalies. in

section 3, we discuss the cancellation mechanism. it turns out that the three dimensional

bulk theory has a gravitational chern-simons term with a discontinuity in its coecient.

the variation of this term cancels the two-dimensional anomaly by inow.

in section 4, we will turn to m5 wrapped on a real manifold s1  3. by duality,
this case will be related to the study of moduli spaces of d-branes, and we will be able

to generalize some of the results here to d-branes wrapped on sl cycles. using the self-

duality of the  eld on the worldvolume of m5 and the fact that b1(3) = b2(3), it

is easy to see that the resulting number of zero-modes from the tensor eld is b1. just

like for d-branes, these modes are paired with b1 zero-modes arising from deformations.

however supersymmetry predicts the stronger result that the target space is kahler. in

constructing the metric, we nd many analogies with the c-map construction of cecotti,

ferrara and girardello [14] and establish we a weak c-map. the result is in agreement

with the one obtained for d-brane moduli spaces [11]. a special care is needed for the

treatment of the normal directions.

2. wrapped m5: complex special lagrangian cycles

here we will perform the reduction to two dimensions of the 6d supersymmetry. as

explained in [8], it suces to consider the reduction of the supersymmetry transformations

of the tensor multiplet from at space. for this purpose we will need the zero-mode

expansion of the 6d elds in the vebrane action.

the bosonic zero-modes

the kaluza-klein ansatz for the chiral two-form  is:

 = aa + ii + uj,

(2.1)

where j is the kahler form on c, {i , i = 1, . . . b20(c)} is a basis of h 2,0(c) and {a, a =
1, . . . b11(c)} is a basis of h 1,1(c). we therefore get b
2 right-moving

2 left-moving and b+

3

real scalars. we have implicitly used the fact that due to the kahlerity of c we have the
decomposition

h 2+(c) = h 2,0(c)  h 0,2(c)  j; h 2(c) = h 2+(c)  h 2(c)

(2.2)

the ve scalars of the 6d (2,0) tensor multiplet parametrize the position of the ve-

brane in transverse ve-dimensional space. when the vebrane is wrapped, four of them
(say x 69) parametrize the position of the four-cycle c inside the calabi-yau four-fold x
while the fth (x 10) describes the motion of the string in the three non-compact dimen-
sions. the massless modes arise from deformations of w2  c preserving supersymmetry.
let m be the space of deformations of c. the tangent space to m at c is

tcm = h 0(c, n )

(2.3)

where n is the normal bundle of c inside x. for c a special lagrangian submanifold the
following equivalence holds [10]:

n = t c

(2.4)

we will rely heavily on this relation in the following. taking into account that
h 0(c, t c) = h 1,0(c) we see that (2.3) implies

dimcm = b10(c) =

b1(c)

(2.5)

let us choose a complex basis {m

the fermionic zero-modes

the vebrane breaks the lorentz invariance of w6 down to spin(1, 1)w2  spin(4)c.
the fermions of the tensor multiplet transform in the (+, 2+)  (, 2). moreover the
spin(5) = u sp(2) r-symmetry of the 6d tensor multiplet is broken by the calabi-yau to
spin(4)n , where so(4)n is the structure group of n . from the 2d point of view there is a
spin(4)c  spin(4)n r-symmetry and fermions in the (2, 2), (2+, 2) give rise to left-,
right-movers on w2 respectively. due to (2.4) the fermions can be thought of as bispinors
on c and are in one-to-one correspondence with (p, q) forms on c: since c is kahler, one

can construct two sets of gamma matrices {m, n} = {em,en} = gmn, [,e] = 0. we will
regard m,em as creation operators and let us denote the fock vacuum by |0i. let r

(l) be a bispinor in the (2+, 2+)(2+, 2) ((2, 2+)(2, 2)) of spin(4)cspin(4)n .
one has

where (p,q) is a (p, q) form on c. we see that from the 2d point of view the number of
(real) left- and right-moving fermionic degrees of freedom is

2 + 1; n f

r = b1 + b+

2 + 1.

(2.10)

in order to reduce the supersymmetry, we need to be slightly more explicit than in (2.9).

let us choose our ten-dimensional matrices to locally decompose as

0,1 = 0,1  (c)  (n )
2,3,4,5 = i12  2,3,4,5  i1(n )
6,7,8,9 = i12  (c)  6,7,8,9

where

we locally decompose the covariantly constant spinor of the calabi-yau as (8) =
(n )   and we take (8),  to be of positive chirality.
if we write (8) as (i) with
i = 1, . . . 4 the symplectic index, the statement about the chirality corresponds according

to our conventions to setting i=3 = i=4 = 0. the fermions are expanded in terms of 2d

notation, of the 2d elds of a (0, 2) -model.

in order to compare with the standard

(0, 1)-superspace description [15] and read o the complex structure of the target space of

the -model, we pass to a real basis: i = 1i + i2i ; ei = 1ei + i2ei . similarly for the

(2.20)

and  is the poincare dual to the cycle c. it is an element of h 4(x, zz) 2 and restricts to
 = c2(n ) = c2(c) on c [17,18], where for the last equality we used (2.4). equation (2.4)
and the exact sequence

0  tc  t x  n  0

(2.21)

were also used in order to derive (2.19).

since c is holomorphically embedded in x,  is of type (2, 2). the latter requirement
(the existence of a holomorphic four cycle) puts a restriction to the complex structure of x.
note also that  is primitive3. in the next section we will explain the relation between  and

the cohomology class of the four-form eld strength g4 of eleven dimensional supergravity.

2 strictly speaking,  is an element of the cohomology with compact support h 4

cpct(x, zz)
which in general for noncompact x forms a sublattice of h 4(x, zz). for a detailed discussion in
a similar context see [16].

3 this can be seen roughly as follows: we locally parametrize x by (la, na), a = 1, . . . 4 so
that c is given by na = 0. then  is schematically given by (n)dn1  . . . dn4. since c is sl we
can locally write the kahler class as  = dla  dna. we thus see that    = 0

7

the conditions that g4 is integral, (2, 2) and primitive are precisely the requirements

for compactication of m-theory on a manifold of eight (real) dimensions preserving four

supercharges in three dimensional minkowski spacetime [19].

finally putting everything together, we see that the total number of (0, 2) multiplets

is b1 + b+

2 + 1, while the rank of the vector bundle over the target space is

rankv =

1
2

(b1 + b

2 + 1) + |(c)|.

(2.22)

note that the model is chiral even when the numbers of left- and right-moving modes com-
ing from the -eld are the same ((c) = 0). the standard formulation with (0, 1) super-
symmetry [15] couples the gauge eld to the fermionic current. the latter can be bosonized

as in [8]. here the left-moving (bosonized) current comes from both the bosonization of
the left moving fermions and from the |(c)| left-moving bosons.

as in [8], in reducing the vebrane action to the worldsheet of the -model, both

the -eld and the gauge connection of the vector bundle will appear at at least to

this approximation. repeating the analysis of [8] to extract information for the metric,

will involve variations of hodge structures of weights one and two. however the classical

geometry of the model is not protected by supersymmetry from quantum corrections [20]

and it is not clear to what extent such an analysis should be trusted.

when the fourfold is of the form k3  k3, the corresponding sl submanifold is still
complex, and the resulting two-dimensional theory can be discussed as a special case of

the more general model presented above. now one has to bear in mind that the fermions

on the cy are no longer chiral. as before, for each cycle i
i = c1(n i) = c1(i) and have bi

1 = 2di + 2 where di = 1

2rxi

2, i = 1, 2 we can take
2
i . then for 1

2  2
2,

b1 = 4 + 2d1 + 2d2

b2 = 2 + (2d1 + 2)(2d2 + 2)

(2.23)

and b+

2 = b

2 . we can see that for the left-movers the gauge bundle can be identied with

the tangent bundle, and the resulting model has (2, 2) supersymmetry in accordance with

the expectations from the general supersymmetry analysis.

8

3. inow in 3 dimensions

following [21], we would like to present an alternative way of counting of the zero-

modes on the string. this counting is based on using the vebrane anomalies. here as

well we can reduce the vebrane anomaly given by [22]

i8(t w, n ) =

1

48  1

4

(p1(t w )  p1(n ))2 + p2(n )  p2(t w )!

(3.1)

by using t w6|c = tc  t w2 and n = n (c  x). on the other hand we know that
the total two-dimensional anomaly (note that there is no anomaly of the normal bundle

anymore) is given simply by the dierence of central charges of left- and right-movers,
istrng = (cl  cr)p1(t w2)/24. comparing with the reduction of the vebrane anomaly
(3.1), we recover

cl  cr =
in agreement with (2.8), (2.10) and (2.19).

1
2

c2 = 

3
2

(c)

(3.2)

we now turn to the anomaly cancellation mechanism and nd some new twists here.

in particular, the discussion of anomaly cancellation is closely related to the jump in the

value of a certain cohomology class (to be identied momentarily) recently discussed in [16].

since in eleven dimensions a complete cancellation of the anomalies on the vebrane world-

volume occurs [23], we expect the same to happen after the compactication/wrapping.

note that in three dimensions, the string is a domain-wall type of object and thus it is

magnetically charged with respect to the zero-form eld strength whose value jumps when

crossing the wall. the source equation for such a string can be written as

d = (w2  m3)

(3.3)

where (w2  m3) is the poincare dual to the string worldvolume. with some abuse of
notation we will call  a cosmological constant; it takes dierent values on the dierent
sides of wall4.

4 one should not confuse this with the case where there is an actual cosmological constant in
the uncompactied dimensions, corresponding to the geometry of m-theory on ads3  x4 [16].

there the cosmological constant turns out to be proportional to the projection of the four-form

eld strength of 11d supergravity to the (4, 0) part of the cohomology of x4.

9

equation (3.3) can be seen as simply the reduction of the vebrane source equation.

somewhat schematically, in this background the vebrane source equation becomes

dg4 = 2(x)dx  ,

(3.4)

where x is a coordinate along the direction transverse to w2 in m3 so that (x)dx represents
the poincare dual of w2  m3. similarly  is the poincare dual of c inside x and can be
represented as a four-form with compact support (c4  x). we see that the cohomology
class of g4/2 jumps by  when crossing the wall at x = 0 in m3.

as seen in [21], when g4 has non-zero uxes through a four-dimensional surface, the

term in the eective action [24],

where

11 = g4  x (0)

7 (t m ),

dx (0)

7 (t m ) =

48

(

p2
1(t m )  p2(t m ))),

(3.5)

(3.6)

can give rise to lower-dimensional chern-simons terms.

indeed there is a ux of the

four-form eld strength through a four-cycle and the reduction yields a three-dimensional

gravitational chern-simons term:

(3.7)

(3.8)

as we have already seen, the string anomaly is  3
we need to examine the ux quantization.

2 (c) as well. to complete the discussion

the compactication of 11 and the chern-simons coupling of the eleven-dimensional
supergravity on fourfolds leads to a tadpole in three dimensions [25,26] proportional to
4/(82)) where  is the euler number of the fourfold x. the coecient
of the three-dimensional gravitational chern-simons term is expected to be the same by

(/24 rx g2

supersymmetry, and we argue that the coupling is of the form:

3 =

3
2

 (c)p(0)

1 (t m )

(3.9)

which taking (3.3) into account cancels by inow the string anomaly. it would be interesting

to check the three-dimensional supersymmetry of these terms directly. note that a similar

structure of a gravitational chern-simons term with discontinuity in the coecient is also

expected from the general discussion of inow on domain walls [27].

10

4. (2, 2) -models, d-brane moduli spaces and the weak c-map

by wrapping the m 5 on 3 in a cy threefold x3, we arrive at a three dimensional
theory with four supercharges (n = 2). further wrapping on s1 gives a (2, 2) two-

dimensional model that can be directly obtained from a d4 wrapped on 3. as we will

see the results easily generalize to all d-branes.

because of the self-duality of the -eld on the worldvolume of m5 and due to the fact

that b1(3) = b2(3), we can get either a three-dimensional theory with b1 vectors or a

theory with b1 scalars, which are dual to each other in three dimensions. in addition there

are dc = b1 zero modes, coming from deformations of the sl submanifold inside the cy

threefold, and a universal sector consisting of two real bosons (and their susy partners

completing a (2, 2) multiplet) coming from the coordinates parametrizing the position of
w2  s1 inside ir1,2  t 2. when b1(3) = 0, the cycle is rigid, and the only surviving
degrees of freedom in two dimensions are the two real scalars of the universal sector. the
resulting cft with c = 3 can be written down explicitly 5. in direct analogy with the

construction of [14], we see that the dualization of vectors leads to a doubling of the scalar

entropic coordinates.

it is clear that this doubling should work in such a fashion to

ensure the 3d n = 2 supersymmetry. we see that indeed the (real) moduli space of the
deformations m is such that tm is a kahler manifold. a kahler metric on this manifold
was constructed by hitchin in [11]. we can now see a physical construction.

fix a point {i} in the moduli space m. at this point the tangent space is

tm = h 1(c, ir)  h 1(c, ir) = h 1(c,c)

(4.1)

let (la, na()) be a parametrization of x such that c  x is given by na() = 0 and
{la} are coordinates along c. the normal directions x a are kk expanded in terms of
the basis {a

i := na/i} of sections of the normal bundle of c  x as

x a = a

i i,

(4.2)

5 it is probably interesting to note that this theory corresponds to a sl three-manifold with
vanishing rst and second betti numbers. such manifolds can be constructed by quotiening s 3

by discrete groups, and they have non-trivial rst homotopy groups. it is an open conjecture that

any closed simply-connected (and therefore with vanishing h1) three-manifold is homeomorphic
to s 3 (poincare conjecture).

11

where  := / i := /i , and ;  = 0, 1, 2 are coordinates on w3. the is are
real.

using the special lagrangian property of c one can show [11] that {i; i = 1, . . . b1(c)},
i , is a basis of h 1(c, ir). the hermitian metric on h 1(c, ir) denes a

where gab is the metric on c. let us dene inertial bases {i} of h 1(c, ir) and {i} of
h 2(c, ir) by

i = i

ii ; i = mi

i i

and let {ai}, {bi} be the dual bases so that

i

i; mi

i =zbi i

hence the metric can be rewritten as

dij = ij i

i mj

since idi , idi are closed as forms on m [11], we have

[ij]

i = 0; [imj]

i = 0

and therefore we can locally write

dij = ijk()

let us now use the above results to reduce the 6d theory of the m5 to w3. like
before (see [8] for detailed discussion of the reduction and for references) it turns out that

it suces to work with unconstrained -eld in the action and impose the self-duality

condition as an extra constraint. the kk ansatz for the tensor eld is

conceptually this is the connection, with respect to the basis {i}, on a bre bundle with

denes an almost complex structure on tm, which can be shown to be integrable, repro-
ducing the construction of [11] in a physical context.

eq. (4.15) denes a set of coordinates which can be shown to be equivalent to the

special coordinates of [28]. indeed we have

dui =zai



(4.18)

where  := j  dj. we can normalize our coordinates i so that at i = 0, i = i
and therefore di = dui (see (4.4), (4.15)). the supersymmetry transformations of section

6 as shown in [8] the reduction of the vebrane action in arbitrary curved background is
recovered (at least to leading order) by rst reducing the action in at background and then

covariantizing.

2 are worked out at i = 0. note that the resulting space tm is kahler, as follows from
(4.8), and has the special property that the potential depends only on the real part of the

complex coordinates. due to this very restricted nature of the target space one may even

expect some non-renormalization theorems in spite of having little supersymmetry. it will

be interesting to investigate this question in more detail.

to summarize, the target space of the -model obtained by wrapping m5 on 3  s1
is given by the moduli space of a d3-brane wrapped completely on such a cycle. due to
the presence of the s1 and the equivalence of 3d vectors and scalars (t -duality), it is clear

that wrapping a d5 would produce a similar target space.

we conclude with two remarks on four-cycles. the case of a d5 wrapped on a cycle

4 in a fourfold is somewhat puzzling:
theory that by general arguments [9] is expected to have very low supersymmetry. from

it would produce a space-lling two-dimensional

the other side as seen from [12], in this case the cycle is complex and kahler and the

cotangent bundle construction yields a hyper-kahler target space indicating at least four

supercharges, and thus a supersymmetry enhancement.

considering wrapped d-branes on sl leads to an identication [4] of the complexi-
ed space h 1(c) and the moduli spaces of stable bundles v on the mirror manifold y ,
h 1(endv, y ). it was conjectured in [28] that this relation is expected to generalize to
h k(c) = h k(endv, y ), for all k. a higher-rank space, h 2(c), appears for the rst time at
dimirc = 4 and is relevant only for wrapped m5-branes (while d-branes dont see this
space). it would be interesting to understand if the m5-brane can play any role in testing

the extended mirror conjecture.
