abstract

we study the correlation functions of the wilson loops in noncommutative yang-mills the-

ory based upon its equivalence to twisted reduced models. we point out that there is a

crossover at the noncommutativity scale. at large momentum scale, the wilson loops in

noncommmutative yang-mills represent extended objects. they coincide with those in or-

dinary yang-mills theory in low energy limit. the correlation functions on d-branes in iib

matrix model exhibit the identical crossover behavior. it is observed to be consistent with

the supergravity description with running string coupling. we also explain that the results

of seiberg and witten can be simply understood in our formalism.

1 introduction

a large n reduced model has been proposed as a nonperturbative formulation of type iib

superstring theory[1][2]. it is dened by the following action:

s = 

1
g2 t r(

4

[a, a][a, a] +

[a, ]).

(1.1)

here  is a ten dimensional majorana-weyl spinor eld, and a and  are n  n her-
mitian matrices. it is formulated in a manifestly covariant way which enables us to study

the nonperturbative issues of superstring theory.

in fact we can in principle predict the

dimensionality of spacetime, the gauge group and the matter contents by solving this model.

we have already initiated such investigations in [3][4]. we refer our recent review for more

detailed expositions and references[5]. we also note a deep connection between our approach

and noncommutative geometry[6][7][8].

the iib matrix model is invariant under the n =2 supersymmetry:

and

(1) =

i
2

[a, a],

(1)a = i,

(2) = ,

(2)a = 0.

if we take a linear combination of (1) and (2) as

(1) = (1) + (2),
(2) = i((1)  (2)),

we obtain the n =2 supersymmetry algebra.

(1.5)

the n =2 supersymmetry is a crucial element of superstring theory.
constraints on the spectra of particles. furthermore it determines the structure of the inter-

it imposes strong

actions uniquely in the light-cone string eld theory[2]. the iib matrix model is a nonper-

turbative formulation which possesses such a symmetry. therefore it has a very good chance

1

to capture the universality class of iib superstring theory. these symmetry considerations

force us to interpret the eigenvalues of a as the space-time coordinates. note that our

argument is independent of the d-brane interpretations which are inevitably of semiclassical

nature[9].

the equation of motion of (1.1) with  = 0 is

[a, [a, a]] = 0.

(1.6)

the cases in which [a, a] = c  number  c have a special meaning. these correspond
to bps-saturated backgrounds [10]. indeed, by setting  equal to  1
2 c in the n =2
supersymmetry (1.2) and (1.3), we obtain the relations

((1)  (2)) = 0,
((1)  (2))a = 0.

(1.7)

namely, half of the supersymmetry is preserved in these backgrounds. the d-branes in iib

matrix model have been investigated in [13][14][15][16].

the bosonic part of the action vanishes for the commuting matrices (a)ij = x

i ij where
i and j are color indices. these are the generic classical vacuum congurations of the model.
we have proposed to interpret x

i as the space-time coordinates. if such an interpretation is
correct, the distributions of the eigenvalues determine the extent and the dimensionality of

spacetime. hence the structure of spacetime is dynamically determined by the theory. as

we have shown in [3], spacetime exists as a single bunch and no single eigenvalue can escape

from the rest. however the appearance of a smooth manifold itself is not apparent in this

approach since we nd four dimensional fractals in a simple approximation. although it is

very plausible that gauge theory and gravitation may appear as low energy eective theory,

we are still not sure how matter elds propagate [4].

the situation drastically simplies if we consider noncommutative backgrounds. these

are the d-brane like solutions which preserve a part of susy. we can indeed show that

gauge theory appears as the low energy eective theory.

in the case of m coincident d-

branes, we obtain noncommutative super-yang mills theory of 16 supercharges in the gauge

group of u(m)[6].

it is of course well-known that the low energy eective action for d-

branes is super yang-mills theory. if we mod out the theory with the translation operator,

we immediately nd the corresponding super yang-mills theory [17][18]. noncommutative

yang-mills theories have been obtained by the compactication on noncummutative tori[8].

2

by compactication, however, we may modify the theory by throwing away many degrees

of freedom.

we have pointed out that well-known twisted reduced models[12] are equivalent to non-

commutative yang-mills theory. the expansion around the innitely extended d-branes in

iib matrix model denes a twisted reduced model. using the equivalence, we have found

noncommutative yang-mills theory in iib matrix model. our proposal is that iib ma-

trix model with d-brane backgrounds provides us a concrete denition of noncommutative

yang-mills theory.

in this paper we further investigate twisted reduced models as noncommutative yang-

mills theory. we investigate the correlation functions of gauge invariant operators namely

wilson loops. it has been well known that the twisted reduced model is equivalent to large

n gauge theory. the natural question to arise is how to reconcile the noncommutative yang-

mills interpretation with the large n gauge theory interpretation. we show that the large n

gauge theory interpretation holds at large momentum scale beyond the noncommutativity

scale. the noncommutative yang-mills theory reduces to ordinary yang-mills theory in the

small momentum scale limit. therefore there is a crossover at the noncommutativity scale.

the organization of this paper is as follows.

in section 2, we study the correlation

functions of wilson loops in twisted reduced models. in section 3, we apply the results of

section 2 to the correlation functions in iib matrix model with d-brane backgrounds. in

section 4, we explain that the results of seiberg and witten can be simply understood in

our formalism. section 5 is devoted to conclusions and discussions.

2 correlators in noncommutative yang-mills

in this section, we study the correlation functions in noncommutative yang-mills. we con-

sider twisted reduced models as a concrete realization of noncommutative yang-mills. re-

duced models are dened by the dimensional reduction of d dimensional gauge theory down

to zero dimension (a point)[11]. we consider d dimensional u(n) gauge theory coupled to

adjoint matter as an example:

s = z ddx

1
g2 t r(

1
4

[d, d][d, d] +

[d, ]),

1
2

where  is a majorana spinor eld. the corresponding reduced model is

s = 

1
g2 t r(

1
4

[a, a][a, a] +

[a, ]).

1

(2.1)

(2.2)

now a and  are n  n hermitian matrices and each component of  is d-dimensional
majorana-spinor. we expand the theory around the following classical solution:

[p, p] = ib,

(2.3)

where b are c-numbers. we assume the rank of b to be d and dene its inverse c  in
d dimensional subspace. the directions orthogonal to the subspace is called the transverse
directions. p satisfy the canonical commutation relations and they span the d dimensional
phase space. the semiclassical correspondence shows that the volume of the phase space is
vp = n(2) d/2detb.

we expand a = p + a. we fourier decompose a and  elds as

a = xk
 = xk

a(k)exp(ic k p),

(k)exp(ic k p),

(2.4)

where exp(ic  k p) is the eigenstate of adjoint p = [p,
] with the eigenvalue k. the
hermiticity requires that a(k) = a(k) and (k) = (k). let us consider the case that
p consist of d/2 canonical pairs (pi, qi) which satisfy [pi, qj] = ibij. we also assume that
the solutions possess the discrete symmetry which exchanges canonical pairs and (pi  qi) in
each canonical pair. we then nd vp =  d where  is the extension of each p. the volume
of the unit quantum in phase space is  d/n =  d where  is the spacing of the quanta. b is
related to  as b = 2/(2). let us assume the topology of the world sheet to be t d in order

to determine the distributions of k. then we can formally construct p through unitary
matrices as  = exp(i2 p/). the polynomials of  are the basis of exp(ic k p). we
can therefore assume that k is quantized in the unit of |kmin| = /n1/ d. the eigenvalues
of p are quantized in the unit of /n2/ d = /n1/ d. hence we restrict the range of k as
n1/ d/2 < k < n1/ d/2. so pk runs over n2 degrees of freedom which coincide with those

of n dimensional hermitian matrices.

we can construct a map from a matrix to a function as

a  a(x) = xk

a(k)exp(ik  x),

where k  x = kx. by this construction, we obtain the  product

ab  a(x)  b(x),

c

a(x)  b(x)  exp(

 )a(x + )b(x + )|==0.

as

t r[a] = detb(

(2.7)

the twisted reduced model can be shown to be equivalent to noncommutative yang-mills
by the the following map from matrices onto functions 5:

the following commutator is mapped to the covariant derivative:

[p + a, o]

o(x) + a(x)  o(x)  o(x)  a(x)  [d, o(x)],

(2.9)

we may interpret the newly emerged coordinate space as the semiclassical limit of x =
c  p. the space-time translation is realized by the following unitary operator:

exp(ip  d)xexp(ip  d) = x + d.

(2.10)

applying the rule eq.(2.8), the bosonic action becomes

in this expression, the indices ,  run over d dimensional world volume directions and , 
over the transverse directions. we have replaced a   in the transverse directions. inside
( ), the products should be understood as  products and hence commutators do not vanish.

the fermionic action becomes

(2.12)

we therefore nd noncommutative u(1) gauge theory.

5a similar mapping which corresponds to a dierent ordering has been considered in the eld theory of

the lowest landau level fermions[22].

5

in order to obtain noncommutative yang-mills theory with u(m) gauge group, we con-
sider new classical solutions which are obtained by replacing each element of p by the mm
unit matrix:

p  p  1m.

(2.13)

we require n = mn dimensional matrices for this construction. the uctuations around
this background a and  can be fourier decomposed in the analogous way as in eq.(2.4) with
m dimensional matrices a(k) and (k) which satisfy a(k) = a(k) and (k) = (k). it is
then clear that [p + a, o] can be mapped onto the nonabelian covariant derivative [d, o(x)]

once we use  product. applying our rule (2.8) to the action in this case, we obtain

found to be g2

the hermitian models are invariant under the unitary transformation: a  uau,  
uu. as we shall see, the gauge symmetry can be embedded in the u(n) symmetry. we
expand u = exp(i) and parameterize

under the gauge transformation, we nd the uctuations around the xed background trans-

(2.15)

form as

a  a + i[p, ]  i[a, ],
    i[ , ].

(2.16)

we can map these transformations onto the gauge transformation in noncommutative yang-

mills by our rule eq.(2.8):


x (x)  ia(x)  (x) + i(x)  a(x),

a(x)  a(x) +
(x)  (x)  i(x)  (x) + i(x)  (x),
(x)  (x)  i(x)  (x) + i(x)  (x).

(2.17)

the equivalence of twisted reduced models and eld theory on noncommutative space-
time is very generic not restricted to gauge theory. we consider a noncommutative 3 eld

theory as a simple example. the matrix model action is given by

s = t r(cid:18)

1
2

[p, ]2 +  3(cid:19)

(2.18)

and by the same procedure as in eqs. (2.5 - 2.8), we can obtain a noncommutative u(m) 3

eld theory:

s = z d

dx tr(cid:18)1

2

((x))2 + (x)3(cid:19)

.

(2.19)

here tr means a trace over (m m) matrices and  = (2/b) d/4. we recall the space-time
translation operator eq.(2.10). we construct the correlation functions by parisi prescription[11]:

< t r[ (0) (y1)   (yl)exp(ik1  x)]

 t r[ (0) (z1)   (zl)exp(ik2  x)]   >,

where

(y) = exp(ip  y)  exp(ip  y) = xk

(k)exp(ik  (x + y)).

(2.20)

(2.21)

eq.(2.20) can be shown to be equal to the following correlator in noncommutative 3 eld

theory:

here we have generalized the denition of  product as

a(x)  b(y)  exp(

c 
2i

2

xy )a(x)b(y).

(2.23)

this correspondence can be proven by plugging (yi) as expressed in eq. (2.21) into eq.(2.20).

in the proof, we use the following identity:

t r[exp(ik1  x)   exp(ikm  x)] = n(xi

ki)exp(

i

2 xi<j

ck

i k

j ).

(2.24)

the principal goal of this paper is to study correlation functions in noncommutative

yang-mills theory through twisted reduced models. since we need to respect the gauge

invariance of the theory, we consider the gauge invariant operators namely wilson loops.

7

the covariant completion of the space-time translation operator exp(ip  d) is exp(ia  d).
we may consider a manifestly gauge invariant wilson loop operator such as

m

t r[

w (c) = lim
m

yj=1
uj = exp(ia  dj)

uj],

(2.25)

where dj is the j-th innitesimal line element of a contour c. after the application of our
results in 3 eld theory to the above, we obtain

z d4xtr[p exp(izc

dy  a(x + y)) vc],

(2.26)

where vc = qm

k=1 exp(ip dk) is the translation operator along the contour c. it is because

lim

m

yj=1
yj=1
yj=1

m

exp(i(p + a)  dj)

exp(ip  dj)exp(ia  dj)

vjexp(ia  dj) v j  vc

(2.27)

where vj = qj

k=1 exp(ipdk). vc carries the total momentum k = bd where d = pi di

is the vector which connects the both ends of the contour.

the total momentum k is smaller or larger than  depending whether d is smaller or

larger than the noncommutative length scale. when the momentum scale is much smaller

than , the contour is eectively closed. these operators reduce to the gauge invariant

operators in ordinary yang-mills theory by replacing  products by ordinary products. since

 product involves derivatives, it is legitimate to do so in the small momentum regime of

the noncommutative yang-mills. the situation is very dierent at the momentum scale

much larger than .

in this case, our wilson loop operators represent open string like

extended objects. it must be clear by now how to construct gauge invariant operators in

noncommutative yang-mills theory by using twisted reduced models.

can we understand the high energy behavior of these correlators? the answer is that it

is identical to the large n limit of ordinary yang-mills theory in a sense that only planar

diagrams dominate the perturbative summation. here we cite the remarkable theorem in

twisted reduced models[12]. it has been shown that the noncommutative phases cancel out

in planar diagrams while they do not in nonplanar diagrams.

8

here we briey explain this theorem. we consider a noncommutative 3 eld theory

again. since x-integral of a -product of two functions coincides with that of an ordinary
product, the propagator becomes the ordinary one; h (k) (k)i  1/k2. on the other hand,
due to the property of (2.24), the 3 vertex becomes

t r 3 = xk1,k2,k3
= xk1,k2,k3

tr( (k1) (k2) (k3))t r(exp(ik1  x)exp(ik2  x)exp(ik1  x))
tr( (k1) (k2) (k3)) n(xi

2 xi<j

ck

ki)exp(

i k

j ).

i

(2.28)

thus we obtain an extra phase at each vertex when we compare the feynman amplitudes

with those in the corresponding commutative theory. note that this phase is dependent on

the ordering of the matrices. if we rewrite the incoming momenta of the three point vertex

(2.28) as

the phase factor in (2.28) can be given by

k1 = l1  l2, k2 = l2  l3, k3 = l3  l1,

exp(

i

2 xi<j

ck

i k

j ) = exp(

i
2

c(l

1 l

2 + l

2 l

3 + l

3 l

1 )).

(2.29)

(2.30)

analogous expressions hold for generic multipoint vertices in noncommutative eld theory.

let us adopt the double line notation for propagators and assign a momentum li to each
single line. each factor in (2.30) exp( i
j ) can be assigned to an adjacent propagator
with a momentum li  lj if there is any. the total phase of a graph can be calculated by
summing the phases associated with the both ends of the propagators in this way. for planar

2cl
i l

diagrams, the phases attached to the two ends of each propagator cancel and the total phase

of a graph is trivial if there are no external lines. if there are external lines, analogous factors

to eq.(2.30) remain which involve only xed external momenta. for nonplanar diagrams, we

must twist some propagators or equivalently, change the ordering of the matrices at some

vertices. hence at twisted propagators, the phases no longer cancel.

if the relevant momentum scale exceeds the noncommutativity scale, the noncommu-

tative phase oscillates rapidly under the momentum integration and it kills the nonplanar

contributions. what is the coupling constant in the large n gauge theory in the high energy

regime of noncommutative yang-mills? each loop contribution in the twisted reduced model

can be estimates as

g2
n

mxk

f = g2m(

)

d

2 z  d dk

(2) d

f

(2.31)

where f is a feynman integrand. we recall that |kmin| = /n1/ d and the integration range is
n1/ d/2 < k < n1/ d/2. we therefore nd that the t hooft coupling of noncommutative
n cm = g2m(2/b) d/2 is also the t hooft coupling in the high energy large n
yang-mills g2
gauge theory. our ndings here has a very important implication for the renormalizability

of noncommutative yang-mills. our conclusion is that noncommutative yang-mills theory

is renormalizable if and only if the corresponding large n gauge theory is renormalizable.

we extend these constructions in continuum theory to lattice gauge theory. we consider

twisted reduced models in pure lattice gauge theory. the wilson action is

1

2g2 x,



t r[zuuuu ],

(2.32)

where g is the lattice coupling constant. the t hooft matrices are the classical solution of

the model which satisfy

 = exp(2in),

(2.33)

where z = exp(2in ). a four dimensional example is

(2.34)

where we assume n is an integer.

in order to make contact with continuum theory, we may interpret  = exp(ic kmin
where the index  is not summed. in the weak coupling regime, we parameterize u as



p)

u = exp(ic kmin



(p + a))

= exp(i(p + a)e),

(2.35)

where |e| = 2/(n1/ d). since  = exp(ipe) is the translation operator, we may regard
u as a link variable on the square lattice with the lattice spacing |e|.  can be reexpressed
as exp(ikmin
 x) where x = c  p and  should not be summed in this paragraph. it also
implies that the target space is the d dimensional noncommutative torus with the radius
n1/ d/. we need to take large n limit to let the lattice spacing vanish and obtain continuum

limit. simultaneously we obtain innitely extended space-time since the radius of the torus

diverges in this limit.

10

we fourier decompose a as

a = xk

a(k)exp(ik  x),

(2.36)



where k = nkmin
and n are integer valued. the hermiticity requires that a(k) = a(k)
and we sum over n2 degrees of freedom. exp(ik x) can be expressed by the t hooft matrices
as

exp(ik  x) = n0

here we nd the relationship between the coupling of the twisted reduced model on the

lattice and the coupling of the noncommutative yang-mills theory g2

n c:

n cm = g2nm|e| d4.
g2

(2.40)

we nd again that the t hooft coupling of noncommutative yang-mills is identical to the t
hooft coupling of high energy large n gauge theory. since the lattice spacing |e| depends
on n for xed , n dependence of g2

n c becomes nontrivial in general.

an example of the wilson loop is

w (c) = t r[yic

ui],

(2.41)

where ui denotes link variables along a contour c. let us parameterize uj = exp(i(p+a)ej).
we then dene vj = exp(ip  ej). the wilson loop can be expressed as

t r[yjc

u(xj)  vc],

11

(2.42)

where vc = p qjc vj. vc is the translation operator along the wilson loop on the lattice.

u(xj) is dened as

u(xj) = vjv j uj v j

= vjexp(ia  ej +

[p  ej, a  ej] +   ) v j ,

2

(2.43)

where vj = v1v2    vj. since vj is the translation operator along the contour c, u(xj) can
be regarded as the link variable at the j-th link on c. we may associate the wilson loop

eq.(2.42) with the total momentum k = pj kj
in the conventional interpretation, the gauge invariant wilson loops of gauge theory are
identied with those with vanishing total momenta in reduced models. in this case vc reduces
to a pure phase. it has been shown that the noncommutative phase factors cancel in planar

 where vj = exp(ikj  x).

diagrams while nontrivial phases remain in nonplanar diagrams. based on this fact, it was

argued that the correlation functions of the wilson loops t r[qjc u(xj)] in twisted reduced

models and in the large n limit of gauge theory are identical[12] since the contributions

from nonplanar diagrams vanish due to the rapid oscillations of the phases.

in view of

our noncommutative yang-mills theory interpretation of the twisted reduced models, we

now believe that this argument needs to be reconsidered. namely the phase factors reduce

to identity if the relevant momentum scale is smaller than the noncommutative scale .

although the expectation value of the wilson loops with length scale less than 1/ agrees

with the large n limit of gauge theory, there is a crossover at this scale and it is eventually

described by u(m) gauge theory at long distances!

the major advantage of the noncommutative yang-mills interpretation of the twisted

reduced model is that we can interpret the wilson loops eq.(2.42) with nonvanishing total
momenta k = nkmin

. we have argued heuristically that n may be interpreted as the



winding numbers of the wilson loops in large n gauge theory with compactication radius
|e|. if reduced models are string theory, the winding modes should be able to be interpreted
as the momenta due to t duality. we have rmly established the validity of these arguments

by showing that k which is smaller than  can be interpreted as a momentum. in this process

we have found that noncommutative yang-mills theory appears in our dual interpretation

of large n gauge theory. the wilson loops with k which is much larger than  represent

extended objects in the continuum limit.

we have pursued the possibility that a version of reduced model denes string theory.

we may postulate that the simple bosonic twisted reduced model eq.(2.32) is a string theory

in the spirit of [19][20]. let us examine this postulate in view of our ndings in this section.

this statement makes sense in four dimensions since the large n gauge theory is believed to

be conning. in fact we can estimate the string tension by using the equivalence of twisted

reduced models and large n gauge theory at high energy regime:

 

1
2 exp(

1

b0g2n

),

(2.44)

where b0 = 1/(4)2(11/3) and 2  bn.
in order to achieve universality, we need to
approach the weak coupling limit by letting the t hooft coupling g2n  0 in such a way
that exp(1/b0g2n )  n with positive denite exponent . the exponent  must be smaller
than 1/2 for this estimate to be valid. if not, the coupling constant remains small at the

noncommutativity scale and we obtain u(m) gauge theory at low energy regime.

3 correlators on d-branes in iib matrix model

in this section we apply the results of the preceding section to the correlation functions in

iib matrix model with d-brane backgrounds. we need to interpret a as coordinates in
iib matrix model due to n =2 susy as we have emphasized in the introduction. for this
purpose, we identify the solution of iib matrix model as x which satisfy.

[x, x] = ic  .

(3.1)

now the plane waves correspond to the eigenstates of p = [p,
where p = b x. x and p satisfy the canonical commutation relation: [x, p] = i
expand a = x + a as before and a and  can be fourier decomposed as in

] with small eigenvalues,

 . we

a = xk
 = xk

a(k)exp(ik  x),
(k)exp(ik  x).

(3.2)

once the eigenvalues of [ a, ] are identied with momenta, the coordinate space has to
be embedded in the rotated matrices c  p as we have seen in section 2. if we identify the
large eigenvalues of a as the coordinates x, we have to rotate the covariant derivatives as

follows:

[x + a, o]  c (

1
i

o(x) + b(x)  o(x)  o(x)  b(x)).

(3.3)

13

note that we have dened a new gauge eld b(x) by this expression. we can map the

matrices onto functions by using the rule eq.(2.8).

we study d3 brane backgrounds in this section. a d3-brane solution may be constructed

as follows:

a0 =

a1 =

a2 =

a3 =

t

l

2n1
2n1
2n2
2n2

l

l

q  x0,
p  x1,
q  x2,
p  x3,

other as = 0,

(3.4)

which may be embedded into n1n2 dimensional matrices. we can further consider m parallel
d3-branes after replacing each element of the d3-brane solution by m  m unit matrix.
under the replacements [a, o]  c [d, o(x)] and a  (1/b), the bosonic action
becomes

=

1

4g2 t r[a, a][a, a]
mt l3
(2)2g2

4

+

1

b2(2)2g2 z d4xtr(

1
4

[d, d][d, d]

[, ][, ]),

(3.5)

where we integrate over the four dimensional world volume of d3-branes. as for the fermionic

action, we nd

t r [a, ]

= z d4xtr( [d, ] + [, ]).

(3.6)

we thus nd four dimensional n =4 super yang-mills theory. the coupling of noncommu-
tative yang-mills is found to be g2
n c = g2b2(2)2. recall that (2/b)2 = r4 is the unit
volume of a quantum and r is the average spacing. the coupling g2
n c is a function of eigen-
value density of the matrices. the low and high density regimes correspond to weak and

strong coupling regimes of noncommutative yang-mills respectively.

we have proposed that the fundamental strings are created by the wilson loop operators.

simple examples are the following vertex operators for a dilaton, an axion and gravitons

14

which are consistent with the interactions of d-instantons[6]:

t r{([a, a] + ic)2exp(ik  a)} + fermionic terms,
t r{([a, a] + ic)([a, a] + ic)exp(ik  a)} + fermionic terms,
t r{([a, a] + ic)([a, a] + ic)exp(ik  a)} + fermionic terms.

(3.7)

we have the corresponding vertex operators in cft[23]:

z d4xtr([d, d][d, d])exp(ik  x) + fermionic terms,
z d4xtr([d, d][d, d])exp(ik  x) + fermionic terms,
z d4xtr([d, d][d, d] + [d, ][d, ])exp(ik  x) + fermionic terms.

(3.8)

we now apply our rule eq.(2.8) to the wilson loops with the replacements [a, o] 
c [d, o(x)], a  1/b. the wilson loops in iib matrix model can be mapped onto
those in noncommutative yang-mills as it is explained in the previous section. for example,

t r{([a, a] + ic)([a, a] + ic)exp(ik  a)}

 z d4xtr (cid:18)([d, d][d, d] + [d, ][d, ])p exp(izc

dy  b(x + y))exp(ik  x)(cid:19)

.

(3.9)

where c is a straight path with the length |c k|. they reduce to the vertex operators in
ordinary gauge theory in low energy regime. on the other hand, they represent open string

like extended objects in the high energy regime.

in noncommutative space-time, it is not possible to consider shorter length scale than

the noncommutative scale. therefore large momentum scale does not correspond to shorter

length scale than the noncommutativity scale. recall that the both momentum space and

coordinate space are embedded in the matrices of twisted reduced models. they are related
by x = c  p. the momenta k are the eigenvalues of adjoint p = [p,
]. the corre-
sponding eigenstates such as exp(ik1  x) and exp(ik2  x) are not commutative to each other
if |ki
). they may
be interpreted as string like extended objects whose length is |c k|. the vertex operator
in our interpretation, the
eq.(3.9) appears to be consistent with such an interpretation.

| >  since exp(ik1  x)exp(ik2  x) = exp(ik2  x)exp(ik1  x)exp(ic k1

k2

wilson loop expands in the orthogonal direction to the momentum which is consistent with
the commutation relation [x, p] = i
 .

15

as we have argued, there is a crossover at the momentum scale . when we consider the

wilson loops, we nd that the planar diagrams dominate at larger momentum scale than

 and the diagrams of all topology contribute in lower momentum scale than . it may be

interpreted as that the string coupling (dilaton expectation value) is scale dependent.

it

is because in our iib matrix model conjecture, the tree level string theory is considered to

be obtained by summing planar diagrams and string perturbation theory is identied with

the topological expansion of the matrix model. with this interpretation, the string coupling

grows as the relevant momentum scale is decreased while it vanishes in the opposite limit.

in the d brane interpretation, the small momentum region corresponds to the vicinity of

the brane, while the large momentum region corresponds to the region far from the brane

since the higgs expectation value plays the same role with the momentum scale.

the dilaton expectation value in ads5  s5 with constant ns b eld background b is[26]

(3.12)

e2 behaves just like the twisted reduced models as we just explained in the preceding
paragraph. the supergravity description is valid when gsmb2 is large. as it will be explained
in the subsequent section after eq.(4.36), the coupling of noncommutative yang-mills is given
by gsb2 when b is large. it sets the radius of ads5 and s5 as well. therefore supergravity

description is valid in the strong coupling limit of noncommutative yang-mills.

as we have shown in [6], iib matrix model is capable to describe at space-time which is

realized at large r region in eq.(3.12) which we believe is an advantage over ads/cft. the

crossover region of noncommutative yang-mills may be understood by supergravity since in
this region (gsm << r4/2 << gsmb2)

(3.13)

it is amusing to note that the branes literally exist at the boundary of ads5 in this inter-

pretation. another limit we may consider is large m limit keeping gsm xed and large:

(3.14)

it may correspond to the ads description of low energy u(m) gauge theory of d3-branes.

what we have found here is that the crossover behavior of the correlators in iib matrix

model with d3-brane backgrounds is consistent with supergravity description which is valid

in the strong coupling regime of noncommutative yang-mills. since the relevant coupling
goes like g2/r4, the strong coupling regime corresponds to high density regime in iib matrix

model. in this regime we therefore nd very weak gravity since the theory is well described

by classical supergravity. we have also studied the opposite limit in[3]. in that regime we

have found very strong gravity. the space-time appears to be fractal instead of very at
ads5  s5. it is very encouraging to nd that iib matrix model is capable to describe both
strong and weak coupling limits of gravity. it raises the hope that it may be able to describe

realistic space-time at intermediate coupling.

4 correspondence with seiberg-witten formulation

we have put forward the iib matrix conjecture that the simple matrix model dened by

the action eq.(1.1) is a nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory. matrix models

naturally incorporate the notion of minimum length scale by the uncertainty principle[21].

we denote the spacing of the eigenvalues of matrices by r. although it is attractive to

assume that there are nite quanta per each volume element of string scale by assuming
  r2, we also need an entirely dierent scale to ensure universality. we have seen that
the large momentum cuto  is much larger than   1/r as   n1/ d with d-brane
backgrounds. we have also shown that the renormalizability of noncommutative yang-mills

is identical to large n gauge theory. we can therefore obtain universal results if we expand

the iib matrix model action around d3 branes for example. we can consider the wilsonian

eective action at string scale by integrating out heavier degrees of freedom. if iib matrix

model conjecture is correct, it must agree with born-infeld type eective action of string

theory.

17

in a recent paper[24], open string theory with neumann boundary condition was stud-
ied in a constant b background 6 , and it was shown that one can get commutative or
noncommutative description of the theory depending on the regularization. chepelev and

tseytlin argued that our d-brane solutions can be interpreted as not pure d-branes but those

with nonvanishing u(1) eld strength[14], while we have shown that they can be interpreted

in terms of noncommutative geometry with vanishing u(1) eld strength. since having d-

branes in constant b background is gauge equivalent to having ones with nonvanishing u(1)

eld strength, apparently these arguments are consistent with each other. the background

eq.(3.1) we studied can also be considered in the string theory context and it corresponds to

a d-brane with nonvanishing gauge eld strength on the worldvolume. therefore we suspect

that their noncommutative description and ours are physically the same. we cannot give a

direct proof of this fact but will give evidences for it in this section.

they start from the euclidean action 7

s =

1

4 z

(gaxax  2ibabaxbx),

(4.15)

where the coordinates x ( = 1   , d) are along dp-branes with d  p + 1 and d even.
if one takes pauli-villars regularization in treating the vertex operators in this theory, one

obtains the usual dirac-born-infeld action with the gauge eld strength f replaced by f + b

as the eective lagrangian for slowly varying elds:

l =

1

gs(2)p()

2 qdet(g + 2(b + f )).

p+1

(4.16)

if one takes point splitting regularization instead, one obtains a noncommutative descrip-

tion. the eective lagrangian becomes

l =

1

gs(2)p()

2 (cid:18)qdet(g + 2 f )(cid:19)

p+1

,

(4.17)

where all the product of the elds in this description should be understood as the  product

dened as

f (x)  g(x) = e

1

2i c  




6here b denote the 2nd rank antisymmetric tensor eld in the (n s, n s)-sector. we use the lower case
letter to distinguish from b in the previous sections. the correspondence between our and their notations
is like b  bij , c   ij.

7in this section we suppress fermionic degrees of freedom for simplicity.

 f (x + )g(x + )|==0.

(4.18)

18

g and c  in the noncommutative description are given by

g = g  (2)2(bg1b),
c  = 2(

1

)
a ,

g + 2b

(4.19)

where ( )a denotes the antisymmetric part of the matrix.

there exist the interpolating descriptions between the two above which was also proposed

by pioline and schwarz[25]. the eective lagrangian is

l =

1

gs(2)p()

2 (cid:18)qdet(g + 2 f + )(cid:19)

p+1

.

 denotes an antisymmetric tensor eld. this time g and c  are given as

1

g + 2

=

c

2

+

1

g + 2b

.

(4.20)

(4.21)

the dp-branes we are considering here can be expressed as a conguration of innitely
many d(p d)-branes in string theory as well as in matrix model as follows. a conguration
of innitely many d(p d)-branes can be expressed by gauge eld and transverse coordinates
x  which are in the adjoint representation of u(). the conguration we consider here is
(4.22)

x  = x,

where

[x, x] = ic  .

(4.23)

this conguration corresponds to a dp-brane with gauge eld strength c1

 = b. there-
fore the worldvolume theory of the dp-brane can also be described as the worldvolume theory
of innitely many d(p  d)-branes. as we saw in section 2, the worldvolume theory of the
dp-brane becomes noncommutative yang-mills theory in this description.

here we will show that there exists such a noncommutative description of dp-brane for
which the eective action becomes eq.(4.20) with g and c  satisfying eq.(4.21). in order
to do so, we should consider such a conguration eq.(4.22) in constant background g, b.
the worldsheet action in the lorentzian signature is

sl =

1

4 z

[g(txtx  xx) + 4ibtxx].

(4.24)

since the second term in the lagrangian is in the form of a total derivative, it can have

nontrivial eect if there are boundaries on the worldsheet. therefore the open string theory

19

with the action eq.(4.24) and the boundary state |bib
action in which b = 0 and the boundary state

 is equivalent to the one with the

|bi0 = e i

(4.25)

when we consider the open string theory with neumann boundary conditions, the factor
e i

has the eect of increasing the gauge eld strength f by b and the physics

2 r db

 xx

now let us consider the open string theory corresponding to the conguration eq.(4.22).

the most ecient way to study open string theory corresponding to such a conguration

is to look at the boundary state. the boundary state for such a conguration has a path

integral representation [15]

|bib

 = z [d] exp[

i

2 z db  iz dp]|biinst.

(4.26)

 denote the c-number counterpart of x in the path integral and the term r db
gives the symplectic form corresponding to the commutation relation eq.(4.22). |biinst is the
boundary state for a d-instanton at the origin satisfying x()|biinst = 0. the canonical
momentum p() is now

p =

1

2

(gtx + 2bx).

from the identity

0 = z [dp ]


p  exp[

i

2 z dp p b  iz dpp ]|biinst,

we obtain an identity satised by corresponding |bi0 as

[

1

2

gtx + (b + b)x]|bi0 = 0.

(4.27)

(4.28)

(4.29)

therefore the open string theory we consider here is equivalent to the one with neumann
boundary conditions for xs but with the gauge eld strength f = b + b. thus we get
dp-branes with f or equivalently dp-branes in b = b + b background.

physics does not depend on the choice of the parameter b and b as long as b = b + b is
the same. since b = c1, we have theories with dierent -products which are physically

equivalent. this is the situation quite the same as the one encountered in [24]. to compare

the theory here with theirs, we should study the eective action for slowly varying elds. in

20

our description, what we should look at is the eective action for the slowly varying uctu-
ations around the conguration in eq.(4.22) of the d(p  d)-branes. the most convenient
way to deduce such an action is to use t-duality. the duality transformation in all the
x-directions maps the action eq.(4.24) to

sl =

1

4 z

[g(t xt x   x x) + 4ibt x x],

(4.30)

where

1

b

1

g = ((g  (2)2bg1b)1),
b = (
g  2b
 x = gx  2bx,
 x = g
x.

g + 2b

x  2b

),

(4.31)

the d(p d)-branes are mapped to dp-branes by this transformation and the vertex operator
corresponding to the coordinate x  is mapped to the vertex operator x for the gauge eld
on the dp-branes worldvolume. therefore the eective action of the d(p  d)-branes can
be calculated as the dimensional reduction of the eective action for the gauge eld on the
dp-branes in the background of g and b.

thus we obtain the eective action for x :

s =

1

gs(2)p()

p+1

2

t r[qdet(g + 2b + i[x , x ])]

(4.32)

here gs should be determined so that the physical quantities such as the brane tension should

be invariant under t-duality. as we saw in the previous sections, we can rewrite this action

as an action for noncommutative yang-mills theory by substituting

x  = c (p + a),

we obtain the following lagrangian after applying our rule eq.(2.8):

l =

1

gs(2)p()

2 qdet(g + 2 f + ),

p+1

with

 = c1  (2)2c1bc1,
g = (2)2c1gc1.

21

(4.33)

(4.34)

(4.35)

it is easy to show that the relations in eqs.(4.35) in addition to b = b + b implies eq.(4.21).

gs in eq.(4.34) should be determined so that the brane tension coincides with the one

for branes in constant background g, b and we obtain:

gs = gs(

det(g + 2)
det(g + 2b)

1

)

(4.36)

for large b with xed g, , we get gs  gs(detb)
tative yang-mills coupling is g2

thus we obtain gauge equivalent descriptions of the theory with varying -products and

they give the same eective actions as the ones proposed by seiberg and witten. this fact

strongly suggests that our descriptions are physically equivalent to theirs.

5 conclusions and discussions

in this paper we have studied the correlation functions of gauge invariant operators (wilson

loops) in noncommutative yang-mills. our investigation is based upon the equivalence of

noncommutative yang-mills and twisted reduced models. such a system appears in iib

matrix model as innitely extended d-brane solutions which preserve a part of susy. we

have studied correlation functions on the d-branes in iib matrix model through twisted

reduced models.

our conclusion is that there is a crossover in noncommutative yang-mills theory at non-

commutativity scale. at long distances it reduces to ordinary yang-mills theory. at large

momentum scale, it becomes identical to large n gauge theory. the coupling of noncom-

mutative yang-mills is shown to be identical to the t hooft coupling in the high energy

large n gauge theory. it immediately implies that the renormalizability of noncommutative

yang-mills is identical to large n gauge theory.

we have pointed out that these high energy degrees of freedom are not commutative to

each other and correspond to nonlocal degrees of freedom in iib matrix model context. we

have explicitly constructed corresponding wilson loop operators. for high energy modes,

the noncommutativity of the backgrounds does not matter and their dynamics is identical
with commutative backgrounds as long as the eigenvalues are uniformly distributed in d

dimensions. in fact each loop contribution from high energy modes can be estimated just

like the quenched reduced models as

g2b4 xi

f = g2(2)2b2r

d4 z 



d dk
(2) d

f.

(5.1)

22

as we have shown, the crossover behavior is consistent with the supergravity description

which is expected to be valid in the strong coupling regime. the radius of ads5 is related to

the coupling of noncommutative yang-mills and it is also shown to be identical to t hooft

coupling of high energy large n gauge theory. we have also obtained gauge equivalent

descriptions of the theory with varying -products by introducing constant background g
and b. we have shown that they give the same eective actions as the ones proposed by
seiberg and witten. therefore their results can be simply understood in our formalism.

in the context of iib matrix model, strong coupling regime corresponds to the high
density regime. namely the spacing of the eigenvalues of the matrices r4 is small compared
to g2.

in this regime, it may be legitimate to expand the iib matrix model around d-

branes since the classical action is small. it appears that high density region represents weak

gravity and low density region represents strong gravity in iib matrix model. we would like

to explore the intermediate density region. for this purpose it is very desirable to formulate

systematic high and low density expansions of iib matrix model.
