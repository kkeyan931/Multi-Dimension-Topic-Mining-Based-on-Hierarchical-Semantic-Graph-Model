abstract. we review1 results of the last two years concerning caloron so-
lutions of unit charge with non-trivial holonomy, revealing the constituent
monopole nature of these instantons. for su (n) there are n such bps
constituents. new is the presentation of the exact values for the polyakov
loop at the three constituent locations for the su (3) caloron with arbi-
trary holonomy. at these points two eigenvalues coincide, extending earlier
results for su (2) to a situation more generic for general su (n).

1. introduction

calorons are nite temperature instanton solutions. they are dened on
ir3  s1. due to the periodic boundary conditions in the time direction,
the polyakov loop at spatial innity (the so-called holonomy) can take on
a non-trivial value (independent of directions)

p = lim
|~x|

p (~x), p (~x) = p exp(z 

0

a0(t, ~x)dt).

(1)

a non-trivial value reveals that the charge one su (n) caloron actually
contains n constituent bps monopoles, whose masses are determined by
the eigenvalues of the polyakov loop

i = 0.

for dening the constituent masses it is important to note that one can
choose a gauge in which 1     n  n+1  1 + 1 (for a proof see [1]).

this guarantees that the masses 82m/, with m  m+1  m, add up
to 82/ such that the action equals that of a charge one instanton.

the separation of the constituents, which are part of the moduli of the
solution, can be chosen freely and for large separation the action density
becomes static. this will be discussed in sect. 2, where we also discuss
the localisation of the fermion zero-mode on one of the constituents. in
sect. 3 we give some details for the explicit computation of the gauge eld,
not presented before for su (n). new will also be the study of the su (n)
constituent monopole location in terms of the vanishing of the higgs eld,
which in the present context is replaced by the polyakov loop variable. in
the core of the constituents the polyakov loop generically will have two of
its eigenvalues degenerate. for su (2) this implies that the polyakov loop
becomes i2, as was veried explicitly [2]. in sect. 4 we present for su (3)
the simple result for the polyakov loop at the three constituent locations.
we also review the fact that in a suitable gauge only one of the constituents
gauge elds is non-static, in accordance to the taubes-winding [3] required
to form out of monopoles a four dimensional gauge eld conguration with
non-trivial topological charge, as is discussed in some detail.

we conclude in sect. 5 with some comments concerning the fact that
perhaps monopoles are more fundamental building blocks, since we know
how to make instantons out of them. but we hasten to say the opposite
point of view can be taken as well, since monopoles can be made out of an
array of instantons. it more seems to imply they occur on equal footing, in
accordance with the democratic vacuum model described in ref. [4].

2. densities

using the classical scale invariance we can always arrange  = 1, as will be
assumed throughout. a remarkably simple formula for the su (n) action
density exists [5]

with rm  |~x  ~ym| and ~m  ~ym  ~ym1, where ~ym is the location of
the mth constituent monopole with a mass 82m. note that the index m
should be considered mod n, such that e.g. rn+1 = r1 and ~yn+1 = ~y1 (but
note n+1 = 1 + 1). it is sucient that only one constituent location is far
separated from the others, to show that one can neglect the cos(2t) term
in (x), giving rise to a static action density in this limit [5, 6].

these generalised caloron solutions can be found [7, 5] using the nahm
transformation [8] and the atiyah-drinfeld-hitchin-manin (adhm) con-

3

struction [9], related by a suitably dened fourier transformation. other
methods, relying more exclusively on the nahm transformation, were de-
veloped as well [10].

the nahm equation for charge one calorons reduces to an abelian prob-

lem on the circle, parametrised by z mod 1,

(4)

giving aj(z) = 2iyj
is usually denoted by tj(z).

m, for z  [m, m+1]. in the monopole literature aj(z)

the basic ingredient in the construction of caloron solutions is a greens

function, dened on the circle z  [0, 1], satisfying

where r2(x; z) = r2

similarity with the impurity scattering problem on the circle [5, 1], which
we present here for the case that m  z  z  m+1 (extended to z < z

(7)

with the gauge eld in the periodic gauge (a(t + 1, ~x) = a(t, ~x)) one
can look for the fermion zero-modes that satisfy the boundary condition
z(t + 1, ~x) = exp(2iz)z(t, ~x). to obtain the nite temperature fermion
2 , whereas for the fermion zero-mode with periodic
zero-mode one puts z = 1
boundary conditions one takes z = 0. for the density of these fermion
zero-modes a very simple result in terms of the greens function can be
derived [11, 1]

|z(x)|2 = (2)22


fx(z, z).

(8)

from this it is easily seen that in case of well separated constituents the
zero-mode is localised only at ~ym for which z  [m, m+1]. to be specic,

4

in this limit fx(z, z) =  tanh(rmm)/rm for su (2), and more generally

fx(z, z) =

we illustrate the localisation of the fermion zero-modes for a typical su (3)
caloron in gure 1.

plane dened by ~y1 = (2, 2, 0), ~y2 = (0, 2, 0) and ~y3 = (2, 1, 0). the masses 82i are
given by (1, 2, 3) = (0.25, 0.35, 0.4). on the bottom-left is shown the zero-mode density
for fermions with anti-periodic boundary conditions in time and on the bottom-right for
periodic boundary conditions, at equal logarithmic scales cut o below 1/e5.

3. gauge elds

to construct the gauge potential a(x), it is instructive to summarise the
adhm formalism for su (n) charge k instantons [9]. it employs a k dimen-
sional vector  = (1, . . . , k), where 
i is a two-component spinor in the n
representation of su (n). alternatively,  can be seen as an n  2k complex
matrix. in addition one has four complex hermitian k k matrices b, com-
bined into a 2k  2k complex matrix b = b, using the unit quaternions
 = (12, i~ ) and  = (12, i~ ), where i are the pauli matrices. together
 and b constitute a (n + 2k)  2k dimensional matrix (x), to which is
associated a complex (n + 2k)  n dimensional normalised (v(x)v(x) = in)
zero-mode matrix v(x),

(x)v(x)  (cid:16), b(x)(cid:17) v(x) = 0,

b(x)  b  xik.

(10)

here x denotes the quaternion x = x. the gauge eld is now given
by a(x) = v(x)v(x). for this to be self-dual, (x) has to satisfy the

quadratic adhm constraint,

(x)(x) = 0f 1

dening fx as a hermitian k  k greens function. the gauge eld can
conveniently be written as (cmp. [12, 5])

the charge one caloron with polyakov loop p 0

 at innity is built out of
a periodic array of instantons, twisted by p 0

adhm formalism by p+1 = p 0
p = exp(2ipm)m,
with  constant, m the colour and p the charge index (spinor indices are
implicit throughout), where ~m  m~  
m. the phases of m are related
to global gauge transformations that leave p 0
 invariant, and dene the
framing of the caloron. we note that fx(z, z) is the fourier transform of
the innite dimensional matrix fx as it occurs in the adhm construction.
it can be shown [13] that trf 2

eq. (6) we nd  log det fx =  log (x), see eq. (3). we also perform
fourier transformation to obtain

m(z) = (z  m) m.

(14)

this implies a remarkably simple result for the gauge eld in the algebraic
(or singular) gauge, a(t + 1, ~x) = p 0

note that  

mm = (|~m|  ~m  ~ )/2 and that pm ~m = ~0 implies

a constraint on . in particular for su (2) one nds 1 
2 = 0, and to-
gether with fx(1, 1) = fx(2, 2), (x) is found to be a multiple of the
identity, such that a(x) = 1
2 (x)c(x). the computation of c(x) fur-
ther simplies when rotating ~1 = ~2 = (0, 0, 2), which can be ob-
tained from 1 = (1, 0) and 2 = (0, 1). with   2 fx(2, 1) and

(17)

also for su (3), fx(m, n) can be determined from the explicit result in
eq. (6) (since two intervals on the circle, partitioned in three parts, always
are neighbours). choosing the three constituents to lie in the x-y-plane we
can take m = (|~m|, i2
compute the gauge eld explicitly, albeit in a complicated form, due to the
need to diagonalise (x).

4. polyakov loops and taubes-winding

in the appendix of ref. [2] the following exact result was found for the su (2)
polyakov loop along the line (taken along the z-axes) connecting the two
constituents,

1

2 tr p (0, 0, z) =  cos(1 + 1

2 zacosh[ 1

2 tr(a2a1)]).

(18)

from this it is easily seen that p (~x) takes on each of the values i2 only
once, with p (~y2) = i2 and p (~y1) = i2 for well separated constituents.
these are the equivalent to the conditions for the higgs eld to vanishing,
an alternative way to specify the location of the constituents. when the
constituents get nearer to each other, these zeros shift outwards (whereas
the maxima of the energy density shift inwards), see gure 2.

7

note that the result for the polyakov loop associated to the constituent
at ~y1 is consistent with a0 = 0, but for the constituent associated to ~y2
this only holds after applying a gauge transformation that is anti-periodic
in the time direction (since such a gauge transformation changes the sign of
the polyakov loop). this gauge transformation has an interesting relation
to the so-called taubes-winding [3], which is most easily understood by
looking at the explicit expression for the gauge eld. in the periodic gauge

(20)

up to relative errors o(e4 min(r11,r22)). for large , (x) becomes time
independent, conrming the static nature of the conguration for large
constituent separations. the time dependence of the constituent at ~y2 is a
full (gauge) rotation - the taubes-winding - responsible for the topological
charge of the otherwise time independent monopole pair [3], see gure 3.
this gauge rotation is achieved by the anti-periodic gauge transformation
g(x) = exp(it3), since g(x)(1 + i2)g(x) = exp(2it)(1 + i2). also
note that for the spherically symmetric bogomolnyi-prasad-sommereld
(bps) monopole [14] a gauge rotation is equivalent to an ordinary rotation.

figure 3. the gauge eld with unit topological charge is constructed from two oppositely
charged monopoles by rotating one of them over one full rotation, while moving over one
time-period.

the information that the constituent at ~y1 is associated to a static bps
monopole, whereas the constituent at ~y2 has acquired a taubes-winding
can be extracted in a way [1] that is also valid for su (n). let us rst
observe that taking one interval z  [m, m+1] in isolation, applying the
nahm transformation [8] gives a single static bps monopole located at ~ym

8

with mass proportional to the length (m) of the interval. taking |~yn|  
creates an innite barrier for the interval [n, n+1] and this leaves the
interval [1, n], allowing for the interpretation of an su (n) monopole with
i specifying the eigenvalues of the higgs eld at innity, for which it is
crucial the i add to zero. indeed, in the periodic gauge a0 tends to a
constant at spatial innity.

this static monopole solution is composed out of n  1 basic bps
monopoles of mass m, located at ~ym, for m = 1,    , n  1. we conclude
that with our choice of parameters, always the eld associated with the
constituent at ~yn has to have a time-dependence to give rise to the topo-
logical charge of the caloron, and we conclude it is this one that carries
the taubes-winding. note that our argument also demonstrates that for
|~ym|   with m 6= n, one is left with a gauge eld that cannot be time
independent, even though the resulting action density is static [6].

the question now arises, what is the equivalent of the zeros of the
higgs eld for su (n). to answer this question we remember that the con-
stituents are basic bps monopoles, which are obtained by embedding su (2)
in su (n). the su (2) subgroup relevant for this embedding is exactly deter-
mined by the unbroken su (2) at the core of the constituent. the restora-
tion of the su (2) symmetry arises due to the degeneracy of two of the
eigenvalues of the higgs eld, or of p (~x) in our case (for n = 2 this in-
deed implies a vanishing higgs eld, which has zero trace, or in our case it
implies p (~x) = i2 as its determinant is unity).

we denote by ~zm the position associated to the the m-th constituent
where two eigenvalues of the polyakov loop coincide. arranging by a global
gauge rotation that p = p 0
 (see eq. (2)), we established numerically for
su (3) that with any choice of holonomy and constituent locations

p1 = p (~z1) = diag( ei3 ,
p2 = p (~z2) = diag( e2i1 ,
p3 = p (~z3) = diag(ei2 ,

e2i3 ),
ei3,
ei1 ,
ei1),
e2i2 , ei2).

(21)

for the caloron presented in gure 1 we nd |~zm  ~ym| < 0.02, and for
well separated constituents ~zm = ~ym. the salient features are that pm is
determined by k not associated to the interval [m, m+1] (on which aj
takes the value 2iyj
m, see eq. (4)). furthermore, the extra minus signs
occurring in p3 reect the taubes-winding, read-o from the gauge eld in
the core of the constituent. it will not be dicult to conjecture the values of
pm for general su (n): p1 = diag(ei(1+2), ei(1+2), e2i3 ,    , e2in ),
     ,      , pn1 = diag(e2i1 ,    , e2in2 , ei(n1+n), ei(n1+n)),
pn = diag(ei(1+n), e2i2 ,    , e2in1 , ei(1+n)). note that pn can
also be written as pn = diag(ei(n+n+1), e2i2 ,    , e2in1 , ei(n+n+1)).

5. discussion

as we have seen, an instanton has bps monopoles as constituents, and the
explicit results in eq. (19) also easily reveal the abelian limit. as long as2
all m 6= 0, the eld outside the core of both monopoles is indeed that of
two bps dirac monopoles (i.e. dyons). for su (2) outside the cores, i.e.
assuming rmm  1 for all m, one has  = 0 and

(x) =

|~x  ~y1| + |~x  ~y2| + |~y2  ~y1|
|~x  ~y1| + |~x  ~y2|  |~y2  ~y1|

.

(22)

we note that when neglecting the exponential corrections, 1(x) vanishes
on the line connecting the two constituents, and log (x) is harmonic outside
of this line. the singularity represents the return ux of the dirac monopole
pair, described in the abelian limit by a term proportional to 2
j log (x) in
the magnetic eld

ek =

3k3 log , bk =

i
2

(23)

in the full theory the return ux is absent (indeed 1(x) has only an
isolated zero at x = 0, corresponding to a gauge singularity [7]).

topological charge is given by the net number of windings (here one) of the frame.

as was already emphasised in ref. [4], to understand how in the abelian
limit the topological charge can be recovered, one needs to preserve the
taubes-winding. this information is described by the framing of the core
due to the charged components of the monopole eld. interestingly this
describes a hopf bration [7], see gure 4. recently the role of the taubes-
winding and hopf bration for retrieving topological charge was conrmed
in great detail within the context of the abelian projection [17].

2the harrington-shepard solution [15] with trivial holonomy (all i = 0), can be
reinterpreted as a bound state of a massive and a massless constituent bps monopole.
massless monopole constituents, giving rise to so-called non-abelian clouds, may play
an important role in electric-magnetic duality as the dual of gluons [16]. these massless
constituents are delocalised and have no obvious abelian limit.

10

we have also seen that the fermion zero-mode is localised on the con-
stituent with the taubes-winding and this makes it likely to conjecture
that this holds for general monopole loops that support non-trivial taubes-
winding, which may be relevant to understanding chiral symmetry breaking
in the context of monopole degrees of freedom. the question which eld
congurations are more important, is however a bit like the chicken and
the egg problem. after all, we can now make instantons out of monopoles
and monopoles out of instantons. monopoles are typically used for describ-
ing the conning large distance behaviour. recently it has, however, been
pointed out there can be a hidden large size instanton component hith-
erto undetected [18]. much remains to be done here, but the calorons have
provided us interesting new avenues to follow.

log(1 + s/3), with s the action density at the lattice site (after clover averaging), through
a plane near to both constituent locations [2].

let us end by mentioning that the calorons with non-trivial holonomy
have also been found on a nite lattice. for su (2) with twisted-boundary
conditions remarkably it was found that when the twist is in the time
direction, the constituent locations are free, but both constituents have
equal mass, see gure 5. whereas, when the twist is in the space direction,
the constituent locations are maximally separated in the direction of the
magnetic ux, but the mass ratios can be arbitrary [2]. this has been un-
derstood in the general context of the nahm transformation for the torus,
relating nite volume calorons to nite volume instantons [19]. the sugges-
tion of ref. [7] to nd these calorons on the lattice by freezing the links on
the boundary of the lattice to enforce the proper holonomy has also been
realised recently [20].
