abstract

we show how some features of the ads/cft correspondence for ads3 can easily be understood
via standard world-sheet methods and 2d gravity like scaling arguments. to do this, we propose
a stringy way for perturbing two-dimensional cfts around their critical points. our strategy is
to start from a stringy (world-sheet) representation of 2d cft in space-time. next we perturb a
world-sheet action by some marginal operators such that the space-time symmetry becomes nite
dimensional. as a result, we get a massive ft in space-time with a scale provided by two-dimensional
coupling constant. it turns out that there exists a perturbation that leads to string theory on ads3.
in this case the scale is equivalently provided by the radial anti-de-sitter coordinate.

introduction and review

relations between gauge elds and strings present an old, fascinating and unanswered question (see, e.g.
[1]). in the last two years there has been much progress in understanding some sort of holographic cor-
respondence, the so-called ads/cft correspondence, between superconformal yang-mills theory and
supergravity or string theory on anti-de-sitter spaces adsd+1 (for a review and refs., see, [2]). equiva-
lence between theories in dierent dimensions raises questions about how detailed bulk information in
one theory can be completely coded in lower dimensional degrees of freedom. despite the large amount
of evidence for the ads/cft correspondence, there is not yet any direct translation of the conguration
of one theory to the other. at the present time it is not known whether the situation may be taken under
control. the purpose of this paper is to provide more evidence in favour of such the correspondence for
string propagation on curved space-time manifolds that include ads3.

there are some good motivation for specialising to ads3

1. first, in this case cft is two-dimensional,
so the corresponding conformal symmetry is innite dimensional. in general, two dimensional cfts
and perturbations around them are better understood than their higher dimensional analogs and one
may hope that this will also be the case here. second, string theory on ads3 can be dened without

turning on rr elds and thus should be more amenable to standard world-sheet methods. so we are
bound to learn something if we succeed.

the features of the ads/cft correspondence that are most relevant to our discussion are the

following:

1.1 ads geometry. we use the euclidean version of ads3. in this case the metric is given by

ds2 =

l2
r2 (dr2 + dd)

,

(1.1)

where l is the radius of ads3. another convenient set of coordinates is (, , ) with r = e. in these
coordinates the metric is

ds2 = l2(d2 + e2dd)

.

(1.2)

the boundary consists of a copy of r2 at r  0, which in the (, , ) coordinates corresponds to
  +, together with a single point at r  +, or   . thus, in this representation, the
boundary of ads3 is obtained by adding a point at innity to r2, which is nothing but a sphere s2.
1.2 world-sheet description. let s2 be a world-sheet whose coordinates are (z, z) and (, , ) be
sigma model quantum elds on it 2. after introducing a ns b eld that is necessary for conformal
invariance the sigma model world-sheet lagrangian with the metric g dened by (1.2) is given by

l 

l2
l2

s(cid:0)  + e2 (cid:1)(z, z)

.

(1.3)

here ls is the fundamental string length. in fact, the above construction denes the embedding: s2 
ads3. from the sigma model point of view one can consider the zero modes of theses elds as the
coordinates in the space-time, i.e. the zero modes of (, , ) are (, , ). the latter has a further
consequence that we will exploit in section 2.

it is convenient to introduce a pair of auxiliary elds (, ), and rewrite the lagrangian as

l 

l2
l2

s(cid:0)  +   +    e2(cid:1)(z, z)

.

(1.4)

taking into account a proper measure renormalization as well as rescaling of the elds, at the quantum
level one gets the sl(2) wzw action with k = l2/l2

s [2, 3].

at this point, it is necessary to make a couple of remarks. first, at the quantum level the last term
in (1.4) becomes the screening operator of the sl(2) wzw model 3. second, at the classical level this
term drops in the limit   + that results in the free actions. on the other hand, we have seen that
this limit is nothing but the denition of the boundary component r2 for ads3. so at the classical
level we have for the space-time theory the following picture: string theory in the background whose
geometry coincides with the boundary of ads3 is described in terms of the world-sheet free elds while
string theory in the background whose geometry coincides with the bulk of ads3 can be thought of as
a perturbation around this free theory. is this the case for the rst quantized theory? to answer this
question, it is desirable to have new ways of understanding the description of boundary in space-time in
terms of the world-sheet path integral whose world-sheet is a closed surface. in the present paper, we
will suggest a way to do so.

1.3 ads/cft correspondence. maldacena conjectured [4] (see [2] for a review and refs.) that string
theory on ads times a compact space is dual to a cft at the boundary of ads. following this work,

2we use bold letters for space-time notations here and below.
3strictly speaking, it is the product of the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic screening operators.

2

methods for calculating correlation functions of various operators in cfts were proposed by gubser,
klebanov, polyakov, and witten [5]. the basic idea is to identify the generating functional of connected
green functions in the cft with the minimum of the classical string (supergravity) theory action,
subject to some boundary conditions. to be more precise, let (~, r) be a scalar eld in ads3 obeying
the laplace equation (  + m2)  = 0. let 0 be the restriction of  to the boundary of ads3. the
ads/cft correspondence assumes that the 0 should be considered to couple to a conformal operator
o via a coupling r 0

o d2. the ansatz is given by

hexpz 0

oicft = exp(cid:0)is()(cid:1)

.

(1.5)

(1.6)

(1.7)

(1.8)

here is is the classical supergravity action.

it should be noted that the asymptotic behaviour of the classical solution is given by

where  is one of the roots of

(~, r)  r2(cid:0)0(~) + o(r2)(cid:1) + r(cid:0)a(~) + o(r2)(cid:1)

,

(  2) = m2

.

0(~) is regarded as a source function while a(~) describes physical uctuations.

it is easy to see that there are two roots of (1.7) for 1 < m2 < 0. explicitly,

 = 1 p1 + m2

.

it was understood by breitenlohner and freedman in the early eighties that for this mass range there
exist two possible quantizations for the scalar eld while for m2 > 0 there exists a unique admissible
boundary condition for the scalar eld in ads3 leading to a unique ads-invariant quantization [6]. in
the framework of the ads/cft correspondence this issue is raised and discussed in [7, 8, 9]. based on
their experience with two-dimensional quantum gravity, where the generating functional corresponding
to the theory with one branch of gravitational dressing is the legendre transformation of the generating
functional corresponding to the other branch [10], klebanov and witten suggested that the two dierent
theories are also related by the legendre transform that interchanges the roles of 0(~) and a(~) [8].
thus the two theories are not independent but are, in fact, related to each other by the legendre
transformation. they also proposed to interpret a(~) as the expectation value of the conformal operator
o(~) namely,

a(~)  ho(~)i

.

(1.9)

it is natural to ask whether the above analogy with two-dimensional quantum gravity, or equivalently,
two-dimensional string theory is deeper. if so, this could lead us to the better understanding of the
ads/cft correspondence by our understanding of 2d gravity. in the present paper, we will show that
2d gravity methods are indeed appropriate for some purposes.

the outline of the paper is as follows. we start in section 2 by describing how the world-sheet
methods and 2d gravity like scaling arguments can be used to describe the ads3/cft correspondence
in the bosonic case. our strategy is to start from a world-sheet representation of cft in space-time
and, then, to perturb such a theory via marginal perturbations of a world-sheet action. the role of
these perturbations is to break innite dimensional symmetry in space-time to nite dimensional one.
it turns out that one of the perturbations is the screening operator of the sl(2) wzw model, i.e. the
world-sheet action has a form (1.4). the latter allows us to interpret this case as string on ads3 and
consider some features of the ads/cft correspondence in the framework of our formalism. we then
go on in section 3 to generalize the results of section 2 for the supersymmetric case. this is done by
simply adding free world-sheet fermions. finally, section 4 will present our conclusions and directions
for future work.

2 world-sheet description for ads3/cft correspondence: bosonic

string

let us now show how some basic features of the ads3/cft correspondence can be caught via world-
sheet methods. to do this, we propose a stringy way for perturbing 2d cfts around their critical
points. our strategy is to start with a stringy representation of cft. the latter means that there
are two virasoro algebras: one acts on the world-sheet and another acts in space-time which is two-
dimensional (for example, the ads3 boundary). next we perturb a world-sheet action by some marginal
perturbations such that the space-time symmetry becomes nite dimensional. as a result, we obtain
a massive ft in space-time. note that a scale for such a theory is introduced by a two-dimensional
coupling constant or in the framework of the ads3/cft correspondence by the radial anti-de-sitter
coordinate, i.e. by . it turns out that the scaling argument of david, distler and kawai [11] applied
for 2d gravity is also useful to study a scaling limit of this ft 4.

2.1 more on the world-sheet description of space-time cft. following the picture we sketched in
subsection 1.2 it seems natural to start with the same set of free elds that is used to describe the sl(2)
wzw model. since the hilbert space of any two-dimensional conformal eld theory decomposes into
holomorphic and anti-holomorphic sectors it makes sense to consider one of them, say holomorphic.
thus what we have is a free boson  coupled to the background charge and a rst order bosonic (, )
system of weight (1, 0). the two-point functions of these elds are normalized as

h(z1)(z2)i =  log z12

,

h(z1)(z2)i =

1
z12

.

(2.1)

the stress tensor of the free elds coincides with the sugawara stress tensor of the sl(2) wzw model
at the level k and is written as

t (z) =  

1
2

 

1
a

2(z)

,

where a = p2(k  2). it is well-known that it provides the world-sheet virasoro algebra with

ln = ic0

dz zn+1t (z)

, n  z ,

(2.2)

(2.3)

and the central charge c = 3k

k2 . the contour c0 surrounds 0.

on the other hand, having a pair of the complex space-time coordinates (, ), it is straightforward
to write down the dierential operator realization for the space-time virasoro algebras e.g., for the
holomorphic sector ln  n+1 
. at the quantum level the most obvious generalization of that is
dz n+1(z). however, the world-sheet reparametrization (conformal) invariance of string
ln = hc0
theory dictates that the vertices should have dimensions one in z so that the integral over dz is invariant.
in other words, the lns have to obey



in the framework of the sl(2) wzw model giveon, kutasov and seiberg [13] proposed to modify the
formula for ln to

[ln, lm] = 0

ln = ic0

conformal techniques may be used to check that at least for the free elds such lns indeed generate

the virasoro algebra whose central charge is given by c = 6kk with k = hc0

what we actually need in practise to do physics in space-time is not only space-time symmetry
generators dened in terms of world-sheet elds but a world-sheet path integral representation for
space-time correlators. for example, a possible way to do this is 5

dz 1(z).

h . . . icft = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

z [dd]pes0[,](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2z [d] es0[] . . .

,

(2.6)

where s0[, ] and s0[] are the standard free actions that provide the two-point functions (2.1). [dd]p
means that the (, ) system has the bose-sea level p. note that up to sign k coincides with the bose-
sea charge qb of the (, ) system, so p is an eigenvalue of k [14].
at this point, it is necessary to make a remark. the ansatz (2.6) means that the balance of charges

for the free elds is simply

# = #

, #  = #

, x i = 0 .

(2.7)

here i is given by ei. this is nothing but the so-called feigin-fuchs representation used to compute
correlators of the sl(2) wzw model. the background charge of the eld  is compensated by inserting
the identity operator (its conjugate representation 1 = exp( 2
a )) at innity. it is natural to use such
an ansatz because we do not know any conjugate representation of the virasoro generators (2.5). as a
simple check, one can compute correlators of the lns [14].

thus, as promised in the introduction, the space-time cft is described in terms of the free world-

sheet elds.

2.2 perturbations. so far we have been studying the space-time cft by the world-sheet path
integral. it is natural to ask whether the discussion can be extended to its perturbations. since we
are interested in the ads3/cft correspondence it is reasonable to consider this space-time cft as
the conformal theory which lives on the boundary of ads3 and try to relate a scale of the perturbed
theory with the radial anti-de-sitter coordinate.
in doing so, what we need is to rst realize which
perturbations lead to ads3. in fact this problem is closely connected with the problem of implementing
space-time boundary conditions within the path integral. indeed, one can start from the world-sheet
action (1.4) and try to directly dene the boundary cft. we have already discussed this issue in [14]
where it was proposed to require that string vertex operators for the boundary theory are independent of
. it is amusing that one cannot dene the virasoro and n = 2 generators in a -independent way but
one can do so for the n = 4 algebra that is in harmony with the maldacena conjecture. however, such
a construction of the bulk theory remains inconsistent because, while it says how to describe the vertex
operators of physical states, it says nothing about the symmetry breaking. indeed, one of the reasons
why ads3 is special is that in this case the boundary cft is two-dimensional, so the corresponding
conformal symmetry is innite dimensional. on the other hand, string theory on ads3 has sl(2)sl(2)
symmetry that corresponds to the global part of the two-dimensional conformal symmetry. after this
is noted, it immediately comes to mind to realize this symmetry breaking by the perturbations. it is
natural to ask whether all such perturbations results in ads3. it turns out that this is not the case, so
we have to be careful at this point.

following the ideas we sketched, modify our ansatz (2.6) to

h . . . i = h esint . . . icft = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

z [dd]pes0[,](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2z [d] es0[]+sint

. . .

.

(2.8)

5actually, it was assumed in [14] that the free actions are perturbed by sint. however, because of the space-time
conformal invariance, sint has to commute with the lns otherwise the ward identities are broken. so we need to be more
careful with perturbations. we will return to this point in the next subsection.

5

so what we have done was to perturb the free actions by sint[; , ; , ]. by analogy with the sl(2)
wzw model, we require

[sint, ln] = [sint, ln] = 0 , n  z .

(2.9)

in other words, sint is marginal for the world-sheet theory. this is, however, not the hole story. a
novelty is to require

[sint, ln] = [sint, ln] = 0

(2.10)

only for n = 0,1. what this means in practice is as follows. we have no longer the conformal theory in
space-time. to be more precise, what we got is the so-called quasi-conformal theory [17]. even though
we have broken the innite dimensional symmetry to its global part sl(2)  sl(2), it is instructive to
ask whether we got string theory on ads3. however, before answering this question, let us give a few
examples of sint obeying (2.9)-(2.10).

(1) following the ideas sketched in subsection 1.2, it is natural to try the screening operator of
the sl(2) wzw model . for simplicity, let us restrict ourselves to its holomorphic part, namely
a ). then, a simple algebra shows that it indeed obeys (2.9)-(2.10). the latter

s+ = h dz  exp( 2

means that the following operator

o0 = z d2z   e 2

a (z, z)

(2.11)

can be used as sint.

(2) we now want to reconsider the above derivation. the idea is to modify s+ to h dz x exp(y).
the analysis proceeds as above and leads to a new solution s = h dz k2 exp(a). thus we can use

o1 = z d2z ( )k2ea(z, z)

(2.12)

as the perturbation of the free theory.
screening operator of the sl(2) wzw model found by dotsenko [18].

it is interesting to note that s is nothing but the second

(3) alternatively, it is possible to nd a solution of the constraints (2.9)-(2.10) in a pure algebraic
way. in doing so, one has to keep in mind that the lns and lms commute. it automatically follows,
then, that any polynomial in the lms is a solution of (2.9). thus the problem is reduced to nding
polynomials that obey (2.10). it is straightforward to write down a solution of the problem. it is simply
given by the quadratic casimir of sl(2) namely,

c2 = l2

0 +

1
2

(l1l1 + l1l1)

.

(2.13)

this means that a formal expression o2 = c2 c2 may be used as the perturbation sint. however, it is
not clear whether such an expression may be written in a local form like r d2z v (z, z).
now let us turn to a geometrical interpretation of the above results. heuristically, the idea is to
integrate away the auxiliary ,  elds in the world-sheet path integral in order to get a term in the
sigma model action that corresponds to g x x  . the last would allow us to reconstruct space-time
geometry. it is well known that it works ne for o0 where one easily nds the ads3 metric. but it
fails for o1 and o2. the problem is that we have no longer the liner dependence on   in sint. so it
is desirable to have new ways of understanding string theory on curved spaces to nd the geometrical
interpretation for these perturbations.

2.3 more on string theory on ads3. as we have seen above, string theory on ads3 can be described by
perturbing the free eld actions within the world-sheet path integral. the result of such a perturbation is

6

breaking the innite dimensional conformal symmetry in space-time. from a local observer point of view
who lives on the (, ) plane, what we got is a two-dimensional field theory in a vicinity of its critical
point. a simple idea behind some of the recent advances in studying the ads/cft correspondence
is that the anti-de-sitter coordinate  is responsible for a scale in this field theory [2]. we will now
attempt to make more precise this statement in the case of ads3. moreover, we will show that it is in
harmony with what we proposed in the previous subsection.

our ansatz for the field theory partition function is that

z[r] = h (cid:0)z d2z   e 2

a (z, z)  r1(cid:1)icft ,

where 0  r  .

as a preliminary check, note that the laplace transformed partition function

z[t0] = lz[r] = z 

0

dr et0/rz[r]

(2.14)

(2.15)

has the expected form (2.8) with the perturbation sint = t0r d2z   e 2

now we will recall how physical states (primary conformal operators) appear in the space-time cft.
several dierent proposals are known to dene them. one is based on the idea that the lns dened in
(2.5) are in fact the coecients of the laurent expansion

a .

ln = ic0

d n+1t()

,

(2.16)

where t() is the stress tensor of the boundary theory. the realization of the primary elds (their
holomorphic parts) via this denition is then 6

[ln, 

m] = (cid:0)n(  1)  m(cid:1)

n+m .

(2.17)

here the 

() = pn  n

ms are the laurent modes of the primary eld whose conformal weight (dimension) is  i.e.,
m. an example of such a realization within string theory on ads3 times some
compact manifold x was proposed in [13]. giveon and co-workers simply form a vertex operator for 
m
by dressing a spinless operator v (z, z) of cft on x by the sl(2) wzw primary eld. explicitly,

m m = z d2z j+m j+ me


2

a j v (z, z)

.

(2.18)

then it follows from eq. (2.17) that for the primary eld  the conformal weight is given by  = j +1.
now we are ready to compare our ansatz (2.14) to experiment. first, let us to dene the scaling

dimension () of the physical operator as it is done within 2d gravity [11] namely,

1

z[r]h (cid:0)z d2z   e 2

a (z, z)  r1(cid:1)icft  r1+()

,

r  0

.

(2.19)

we can use a simple scaling argument to evaluate the one-point functions of the operators (2.18). indeed,
shifting the zero mode of the eld 

a
2
6alternatively, one can think about the lns as ln() = hc

   +

of this approach within string theory on ads3.



log r

d  (   )n+1t( )(). see [19] for a discussion

(2.20)

7

and assuming that the path integral measure [d] is invariant under such a shift we nd that the scaling
dimension is given by () = j + 1.

moreover, taking into account the contribution from the -function we get for the non-normalizable

one-point functions

h (cid:0)z d2z   e 2

a (z, z)  r1(cid:1)

m m icft  r()

.

(2.21)

now we can easily read o some interesting conclusions. one of the rst observations is that the
conformal weights (dimensions with respect to l0) of the operators (2.18) coincide with their scaling
dimensions namely,  = (). this gives us a hint that one should try to catch dynamics of such
operators via the eective action for scalar elds in the ads3 background. further evidence in favour
of this suggestion is provided by comparing eq. (1.6) to eq. (2.21). indeed, we can interpret the last
equation as the asymptotic behaviour of the eective scalar eld namely, its part related with physical
uctuations. the latter assumes that a(~) has the following representation

a(~)  rh (cid:0)z d2z   e 2

a (z, z)  r1(cid:1)(~)icft ,

r  0

,

(2.22)

where (~) = pm m m  m

(see (1.9)).

m m. this is exactly what klebanov and witten proposed in [8]

next, let us go on to look more carefully at the picture we propose. according to our discussion, we
have the same set of the physical operators (2.18) for both the cft and string theory on ads3. the
only dierence between these theories is the ansatz used to compute space-time correlators. thus we
have the explicit example of the translation of physical states of one theory to another.

2.4 towards rg analysis. up to now our discussion has not been sensitive to the second term in the
asymptotic behaviour (1.6) that is responsible for a source. a question remains, however, as to what
is a good world-sheet approximation for it. a possible answer to this question immediately comes to
mind just by looking at the ansatz (1.5) for the ads/cft correspondence. so we would like to relate
world-sheet couplings ti with the sources.

as a preliminary check, let us consider the perturbation t0r d2z   e 2

a . as before, we can shift 
to determine the scaling dimension of the operator r d2z   e 2
a . thus 0 = 0. on the other hand, a
scaling argument shows that z[r]  r as r  0. using the laplace transform (2.15), we nd that the
partition function z[t0] scales as t2
7. in terms of r it corresponds to r2. this
is the expected form of the asymptotic behaviour for zero conformal dimension.

0. so for h t0 i, we have t3

0

we want now to repeat this analysis in a general case. as before, the rst step is to nd the scaling
law for h ti i in terms of t0. in fact, the ansatz (1.5) assumes that all h tioi i should scale in the same
. so what we nd for h ti i is then t3i
way, i.e.
.
in terms of r it is replaced by r2i. this is exactly what we need to push our interpretation of the
world-sheet coupling constants as the space-time sources namely, in the scaling limit

0. the latter means that ti behaves as t1i

like t2

0

0

0i(~)  ri2l1h ti i

,

r  0 .

(2.23)

we would like to make a few comments:

1. although the representations for a and 0 given by (2.22)-(2.23) look in many ways attractive,
we have to stress their speculative character. they rest on the scaling argument only, and so further
work is needed to prove them strictly. moreover, we do not know any similar representation for the
product 0

o(~) in eq. (1.5). what we can only refer to the examples of subsection 2.2.

7h 1 i corresponds to the partition function z of the perturbed theory. so h t0 i is simply t0z.

8

2. as we saw in the previous subsection, the scale of the perturbed theory is provided by the anti-
de-sitter coordinate . this means that the coupling constant (source) in eq. (1.5) becomes running,
i.e. 0(~, r). the latter allows to dene the corresponding -function as

i = rr0i(~, r)

.

(2.24)

it is natural to suggest that the scaling limit of the running coupling is described via l1h ti i. thus
the linearized -function is simply

i = (2  i)0i(~, r)

.

(2.25)

a simple observation is, then, that i vanishes for i = 2, i.e. for the operator whose dimension equals
2. this gives us a hint that one should catch dynamics of such the operator via the eective action for
the massless scalar eld. this is in harmony with the formula (1.7).

3. note that the situation that we are considering here is more subtle than the one in two-dimensional
gravity in which the legendre transformation of the generating functional corresponds to the other
branch of gravitational dressing. the crucial point is that in the problem at hand a transformation has
to know about the unitary bound. in other words, it should be dened only for the range 0    2.
so a naive attempt to adopt the 2d gravity analysis [10] fails.

inclusion of susy

according to the maldacena conjecture, in the situation that we are considering the theory on the
boundary of ads3 has to possess the n = 4 superconformal algebra as the symmetry algebra. thus, in
this section we will generalize and apply the previous results to the supersymmetric case.

3.1 world-sheet description of space-time scft. following the original analysis of [13], the world-

sheet description of n = 4 scft on the boundary of ads3 is as follows.

the ads3-part (its holomorphic sector) is described by the same set of the free elds we used in
subsection 2.1 namely, (, , ). the only dierence is that the level k is shifted as k  k + 2. the
latter is due to free fermions with the two-point functions

hi(z1)j (z2)i =

ij
z12

,

(3.1)

where i, j = 0,; 00 = 1, + = + = 2.
it is well-known that such fermions are needed to
dene the world-sheet n = 1 superconformal algebra that is standard within the nsr formulation of
superstring theories.

the s3-part (its holomorphic sector) can be described in a similar way. so we introduce a free
boson c coupled to a background charge, the a order bosonic system (c, c) of weight (1, 0) and three
fermionic elds i

c. the two-point functions of these elds are normalized as

hc(z1)c(z2)i =  log z12

,

hc(z1)c(z2)i =

1
z12

,

c(z1)j

hi

c (z2)i =

(3.2)

where i, j = 0,; 00

the stress tensor of the bosonic elds is given by

c = +

c = 2.

tc(z) = cc

(3.5)

in a similar way, the stress tensor of the free fermions coincides with the sugawara stress tensor of the
su(2) wzw model at the level 2. the corresponding currents are given by

c (z) = i

c (z)

(3.6)

as to a manifold x, it is usually associated with t4 or k3. the explicit choice is not crucial
for what follows, however, to be more precise let us take the four torus as x. then, the t4-part (its
holomorphic sector) can be described by four scalar elds x  without background charges together with
their fermionic partners ,  = 1, . . . , 4. their two-point functions can be normalized as it was done
in (3.2). finally, one should keep in mind the corresponding superconformal ghosts that are needed to
cancel the conformal anomaly [13, 20].

having the above set of the free elds, we now wish to realize the superconformal algebra of the
boundary scft. this can be done as in [13]. let us restrict ourselves to the holomorphic sector. the
virasoro generators (2.5) are modied to

ln = 

1

2 ic0

dz n(cid:16)2 + a(n + 1)  (n2  1)+ + i(n2 + n)1+0 + i(n2  n)0(cid:17)(z)

(3.7)

where a is now 2k.

the su(2) generators are provided by the s3-part, or equivalently by the supersymmetric su(2)

wzw model. explicitly

a simple algebra shows that such dened lns and ta
superconformal algebra whose central charge is c = 6kk.

dz n(cid:0) j i

n = ic0

, n  z .

c(cid:1)(z)
ns obey the commutation relations of the n = 4

(3.8)

it is known that one of the drawbacks of the nsr formalism is that it is not manifestly supersym-
metric. in the problem at hand it is rather dicult to explicitly write down all fermionic generators.
for simplicity, we will restrict ourselves to the global generators. in the nsr sector they are simply [13]

q

dz e 1

2 s(z)

,  = ,  .

(3.9)

here  is the scalar eld which appeared by the bosonization of the superconformal ghosts. s are the
so-called spin elds of the n = 1 world-sheet superconformal algebra. note that the spin elds are built
only via the fermions , c, .

10

finally, let us generalize our ansatz (2.6). for example, this can be done as

h . . . iscft = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

z [dd]pes0[,](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2z [d] es0[](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

z [dcdc]0es0[c,c](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2z [dc] es0[c] . . .

,

(3.10)

above, we have omitted the additional scalars elds as well as the fermions and the superconformal
ghosts. the path integral measures for these elds are standard (see e.g., [20]). we use the feigin-fuchs
representation again, so we require the following balance of charges

# = #

, #  = #

, x i = 0

, #c = #c

, # c = #c

, x ci = 0

,

(3.11)

where i, ci are given by ei and eic ic, respectively. it should be noted that unlike the (, ) system
of the ads3-part, the (c, c) system of the s3-part has zero bose sea level.

3.2 the world-sheet description of superstring theory on ads3  s3  x. to get superstring theory
from scft, we follow the same strategy as we proposed in section 2. so we perturb the free world-sheet
actions by a marginal perturbations such that the space-time symmetry becomes nite dimensional
while g x x  term with the ads3 metric appears in the world-sheet action. as a result, we get a
supersymmetric ft in space-time. again, a scale for this theory is provided by a world-sheet coupling
constant, or equivalently, by the radial anti-de-sitter coordinate .

let us rst modify the ansatz (3.10) to

we now require that sint obeys 8

h . . . i = h e

sint . . . iscft .

[ sint, ln] = [ sint,

ln] = 0

, n  z ,

(3.12)

(3.13)

where ln means a total world-sheet virasoro generator. so, sint is marginal within the world-sheet
theory.

to extend our bosonic analysis to the supersymmetric case, we need, in addition to

[ sint, ln] = [ sint, ln] = 0 ,

only for n = 0,1

,

(3.14)

that sint obeys

[ sint, ti

n] = [ sint, ti

n] = 0 ,

for n = 0 and [ sint, q

r ] = [ sint, q

r ] = 0

,

for

r = 

1
2

.

(3.15)

thus we have no longer a superconformal theory in space-time. to be more precise, what we got is
the global n = 4  n = 4 algebra. in the above, we restrict ourselves to the neveu-schwarz sector.
however, the generalization to others is straightforward.

let us now give a few examples of sint obeying (3.13) -(3.15).
(1) as in section 2, let us try the screening operator of the sl(2) wzw model. a precisely analogous

computation shows that it indeed obeys (3.13)-(3.15). thus the following operator

o0 = z d2z   e 2

a (z, z)

(3.16)

8strictly speaking, we also need to require that [ sint, gr] = [ sint,

gr] = 0, where the gr(

gr)s are the n = 1 fermionic

generators. however, it proves irrelevant for what follows.

11

can be used as sint.

there is a point we should mention. integrating the auxiliary elds ,  in the world-sheet path
integral away, we get a non-linear term in the sigma model action which corresponds to g x x 
with the metric of ads3 while the fermionic terms remains quadratic. here an analogy with the gs
formulation appears because such behaviour reminds results of gauge xing the gs action where the
fermionic term becomes quadratic (see e.g., [21, 22]).

(2) it is also not dicult to nd one more operator obeying the above constraints. a simple algebra

shows that it is given by

o1 = z d2z ( )kea(z, z)

.

(3) obviously, the quadratic casimir of the global n = 4  n = 4 algebra
0 + 2 q

(3.17)

(3.18)

obeys the constraints. however, it is not clear how to rewrite c2

c2 in a local form.

r d2z (c c)keiac are marginal for both space-time and world-sheet theories.

it is interesting to note that the screening operators of the su(2) wzw model r d2z c c e
we conclude this subsection with a brief discussion of o1. on the one hand, it is the second screening
operator of the sl(2) wzw model. moreover, it is known that it becomes the second screening operator
for the liouville theory under the drinfeld-sokolov reduction. the latter is similar to a lightcone-like
gauge in the context of the ads/cft correspondence [2]. on the other hand, the second screening
operator is crucial for a strong coupling regime of 2d gravity 9. so putting the two facts together, we
suggest that the correct perturbation of the free actions is given by

a c and

2i

sint = o0 + o1

.

(3.19)

let us give one more evidence in favour of this suggestion. obviously, these operators coincide for k = 1.
in this sense, something should happen as one approaches this value. this problem was rst discussed
in [24] and later in [25]. however, our description is dierent because in fact it assumes an analogy with
the so-called c = 1 barrier in two-dimensional quantum gravity [12].

3.3 more comments on superstring theory. the extension of our analysis of subsections 2.3 and 2.4 to
the supersymmetric case is straightforward. therefore, we only summarize the most relevant formulae.

a new ansatz for the partition function is given by

z[r] = h (cid:0)z d2z   e 2

a (z, z)  r1(cid:1)iscft .

(3.20)

of course, one can easily get the expected form (3.12) with sint = t0r d2z   e 2

transformation.

it seems natural to dene the scaling dimension ( ) of the physical operator as

a (z, z) by the laplace

1

z[r]h (cid:0)z d2z   e 2

a (z, z)  r1(cid:1) iscft  r1+( )

,

r  0 ,

(3.21)

and, then, to probe the vertex operators proposed by giveon and co-workers [13]. in the supersymmetric
case these operators look like hatted versions of (2.18). on the one hand, the commutation relations

9 the interested reader is referred to lectures of gervais [23].

12

with the virasoro generators show that their conformal dimension is given by  = j + 1. on the other
hand, the scaling argument gives the scaling dimension as ( ) = j + 1. therefore, as in subsection
2.3, we propose the following representation of a

a(~)  rh (cid:0)z d2z   e 2

a (z, z)  r1(cid:1) 



(~)iscft ,

r  0 ,

(3.22)



with 
witten proposal [8].

(~) = pm m m   m 


m m. this is the world-sheet representation of the klebanov and

as to the space-time sources 0i, we again propose that their scaling limit is described via l1h ti i.
this allows to nd the linearized -function. explicitly, i = (2  i)0i.
we here conclude this section with some speculations about eq.(1.7) which gives the relation between
the mass m of the eective scalar eld in ads3 and the conformal dimension  of the corresponding
boundary operator.

in free elds terms, it means the following rescaling for the scalar eld   q 2

(1) in general, it is not clear how to dene the s-matrix within field theory in ads spaces. as a
result, we cannot consistently dene masses as poles in the scattering amplitudes. so, the best what
we can do in the problem at hand is to take the at limit l  . the latter is equivalent to the limit
k . thus
k  .
the exponent in eq.(2.18) becomes ej. as to the elds  and , it is useful to bosonize them in the
standard way, for instance  = ei12
. now we can dene the mass just as the sum of exponents. so,
we nd m2 = j2. note that the bosonization makes clear that  and  do not contribute. however,
there is a contribution of other elds. since we are only interested in a dependence of j we simply
modify the formula to m2 = j2 + const. there are the two facts that we should remind. the rst is
that the conformal dimension of the operators (2.18) is given by  = j + 1. the second is that the
-function vanishes for  = 2 that signals about massless modes. so putting these facts together, we
recover the relation (1.7).

(2) there is an equation in 2d quantum gravity that relates the gravitational scaling dimensions with
the bare scaling dimensions [12]. it is the so-called knizhnik-polyakov-zamolodchikov (kpz) equation.
explicitly,

kpz(kpz  1)

s  1

 kpz = 0

.

(3.23)

here s means the string exponent (string susceptibility). in the liouville theory it is dened via the
scaling of the partition function i.e., z[a]  as3, where a is the invariant area.
after this is noted, it immediately comes to mind to interpret the relation (1.7) as an analogy of the
kpz equation. first, let us dene the string exponent as z[r]  r3s. a motivation for this denition
is a simple analogy between r1 and a as they appear in the partition functions. it also assumes that
r d2z   e 2
a  can be interpreted as the cosmological operator in the problem of interest. accepting the
above denition, a result we can draw is s = 2. by substituting this value into eq.(3.23), we easily nd
the left hand side of the relation (1.7). however, the missing point of the derivation sketched above is
a possible interpretation of the bare dimensions as the masses of the eective scalars in ads3.

of course, these conclusions are heuristic and further work is needed to make them more rigorous.

4 conclusions and remarks

first let us say a few words about the results.

13

in this work we have reproduced the basic features of the ads/cft correspondence for ads3 via
the world-sheet methods and scaling arguments like in 2d gravity. in doing so, we proposed a stringy
way for getting a vicinity of critical points.
in the case of interest we started from the world-sheet
description of the cft in space-time that is the boundary of ads3. next we perturbed the world-sheet
action by the marginal operator that gave us nite dimensional symmetry in space-time and provided
the non-linear term in the world-sheet action which correspond to g x x  with the metric of ads3.
we interpreted the result as string theory on ads3. the scale was introduced via the two-dimensional
coupling constant, or equivalently, the radial anti-de-sitter coordinate. then we studied the scaling
limit via the 2d gravity scaling argument. we found the basic features of the ads/cft correspondence
within our formalism. although our procedure looks many ways attractive, we have to stress some
speculative character. it is clear that further work is needed to make this more rigorous.

let us conclude by mentioning a few problems that are seemed the most important to us.
(i) in fact, all what we found in sections 2 and 3 corresponds to the eective action which is
quadratic in the scalar eld. it is known that such action allows to recover the conformal dimensions of
the corresponding operators via their two-point functions. so, the open problem is to understand how
to compute higher order terms in the eective action within our construction.

(ii) relations between integrable field theories and conformal field theories have been much
studied of late. a possible approach to this problem by zamolodchikov is to perturb cft by some
operators that lead to integrable ft [26]. the construction we proposed allows to get a vicinity of
critical points in a stringy way. so, it is rather natural to ask whether it may be used to study
integrable field theories.

(iii) finally, the problem that obviously deserves more attention is the supersymmetry breaking.
for instance, n = 4  n = 2 or n = 4  n = 0. in the framework of our construction it means that
we need to nd such sint that commutes only with the generators of the rest symmetry.
