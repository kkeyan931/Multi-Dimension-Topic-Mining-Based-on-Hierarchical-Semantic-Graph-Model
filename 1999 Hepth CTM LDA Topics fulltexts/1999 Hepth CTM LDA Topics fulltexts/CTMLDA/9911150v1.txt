gravitons and gauge elds in chern-simons supergravity

maximo banados a

adepartamento de fsica teorica, universidad de zaragoza,
ciudad universitaria, zaragoza 50009, spain.

despite the nice geometrical properties of higher dimensional chern-simons (cs) supergravity theories these
actions suer from one major drawback, namely, their connection with the real world. after some quick remarks
on three-dimensional gravity, we consider ve-dimensional cs supergravity and study to what extend this theory
reproduces the standard low energy description of gravitons and gauge elds. we point out that if one deforms the
cs action by changing the value of the cosmological constant by a small amount (thus breaking the cs symmetry),
propagation around ads becomes non-trivial, asymptotically schwarzschild-ads solutions exist, and the gauge
eld acquires its standard quadratic propagator. this is the written version of an invited lecture delivered at the
qg99 meeting, held in sardinia, italy, on sept. 1999.

1. introduction

chern-simons (cs) gravity and supergravity
exist in all odd dimensional spacetimes. the
three-dimensional case, however, stands apart.
there are two reasons for this. first, the 3d cs
action is equivalent (up to some issues as the in-
vertibility of the metric) to the standard metric
action, as opposed to the higher dimensional cs
theory which includes high order powers in the
curvature tensor. second, the 3d theory is spe-
cial due to its great simplicity. there are many
beautiful calculations that can be done yielding
interesting and surprising results, most notably,
the existence of an asymptotic conformal symme-
try [1], and its role in understanding the 3d black
hole entropy [2].

neither the conformal algebra nor its applica-
tion to black hole physics really need the cs for-
mulation. however, this representation provides
simple derivations of some results which are oth-
erwise complicated. as motivation to study the
higher dimensional cases, we shall briey review
in sec. 2 the derivation of the brown-henneaux
conformal algebra using the cs formulation.

higher dimensional cs gravitational theories
are far less developed than the 3d case. still,
it has been shown that black holes do exists [3],
and the asymptotic structure has some of the el-
ements of the 3d case [4] (see, for a recent dis-

cussion, [5]). in sec. 3 we shall study whether
5d cs supergravity has some relation with stan-
dard 5d supergravity [28] (which is known to de-
scend from 11d supergravity). we shall point out
that if one breaks the cs symmetry by changing
the value of the cosmological constant by a small
amount, then solutions which are asymptotically
ads-schwarzschild do exist, and the gauge eld
entering in the supergravity action acquires its
standard propagator.

2. three-dimensional gravity

three dimensional gravity has been analysed
from many dierent points of view; we refer the
reader to [710] for a complete treatment of dif-
ferent aspects of this theory.

in this section we will discuss a short deriva-
tion of the brown-henneaux conformal algebra
[1]. this symmetry plays an important role in 3d
gravity and black hole physics [2]. for a recent
generalization of the following results to higher
dimensions see [11].

consider the three-dimensional anti-de sitter

line element,

ds2

l2 = e2dwd w + d2
which will be our background metric. the pa-
rameter l is the ads radius and all coordinates

and where

transformation law (8) corresponds to a virasoro
operator with central charge

(10)

see [12] for an extensive recent exposition on two
dimensional conformal eld theory.

note that when applying the conformal trans-
formation (4) one also needs to change the radial
coordinate. this is the brown-henneaux version
of the ir-uv correspondence discussed in [13].

(half of)

this derivation of

the brown-
henneaux symmetry is particularly interesting for
two reasons. first, it deals with a nite conformal
transformation showing clearly that anti-de sitter
space knows very well the schwarzian derivative.
second, it acts in a natural way on the space of
solutions of the theory mapping solutions into so-
lutions.

now, there is a very important point that we
have omitted so far. we have found the transfor-
mation properties of t via a simple transforma-
tion of coordinates. why should we expect this
coordinate redenition to carry relevant informa-
tion? the reason is that (4) does not go to the
identity at the (conformal) boundary    of
anti-de sitter space. indeed, f does not depend
on  at all.
it is well known that those gauge
transformations that do not go fast enough to
zero at the boundary may represent non-trivial
degrees of freedom.

a powerful way to understand this point is the
regge-teitelboim approach [14]. the idea is that
a proper gauge transformation is generated by a
constraint and act on physical states by annihila-
tion g|i = 0. the state is thus invariant. how-
ever, those gauge transformations whose param-
eters do not vanish fast enough at the boundary
are not generated by constraints and it is then
inconsistent to assume that they leave physical
states invariant. the transformation w  w is
an example of this class of symmetries. a corol-
lary of this result is that two metrics of the form

are dimensionless.

is the 3d (dimensionless) gr coupling constant
and t (w) is an arbitrary holomorphic function

it is direct to prove that (2) is still an
exact solution to the equations of motion. the
most general perturbation preserving the bound-
ary conditions also involves an arbitrary function
of w [1] (see [10] for the explicit form of the met-
ric), but for our purposes here this holomorphic
version will be quite useful.

in the context of the ads/cft conjecture, we
expect the perturbations t (w) to be related to
a conformal eld theory dened on the complex
plane w. to check this, let us act on (2) with a
conformal transformation w  w,
w = f (w)

(4)

where f is an arbitrary function of w.

the new metric is of course still a solution of
the equation of motion, but it changes its form,

dierent solutions to the equations of motion.

this issue, applied to 3d gravity, has been anal-
ysed in detail in [1] where it was shown explicitly
that the conformal map w  w is not generated
by a constraint. we shall now make the transi-
tion to the cs formulation and review a simple
derivation of this fact. the rest of this section
is well-known material and we include it here for
completeness. we shall follow mainly [15] and
[16], and assume some familiarity with the chern-
simons formulation of three dimensional gravity
[18,19].

we shall rst discuss the appearance of an
ane kac-moody algebra (at the boundary) in
any cs theory with a group g.
the canonical generator g() associated to a
gauge transformation, aa = da = [aa, g()],
in any three-dimensional chern-simons theory is
given by [20,15],

g() =

k

4 z

af a 

k

4 z

aaa.

(11)

here  is a two dimensional spatial section with
boundary , f is the 2-form curvature and a
the gauge eld. the equations of motion of cs
theory are f = 0 showing that the bulk part of
(11) is indeed a constraint, however, the bound-
ary piece does not vanish on shell.

if  is zero and a is nite at  then the
boundary term in (11) is zero. this corresponds
to a proper gauge transformation which does not
change physical states. but the action is also in-
variant under transformations with non-zero val-
ues of  at the boundary1. the canonical formal-
ism is powerful enough to generate gauge trans-
formation whose parameters do not vanish at the
boundary provided the charge

k

4 z

aaa

j() = 
is nite. in this case, the corresponding transfor-
mation is not gauge because it is not generated
by a constraint.

(12)

1provided some boundary conditions are obeyed. for
example, one can impose the chiral boundary condition
a w = 0; the residual group contain all parameters which
at the boundary only depend on w, but are not necessarily
zero there.

3

the charge j is not a gauge invariant quan-
tity because a transforms inhomogeneously un-
der gauge transformations. we act on j with a
gauge transformation aa = da = da +[a, ]a
obtaining,

j() = 

k

4 z
= j([, ]) 

([, ]aaa + ada)

k

4 z

(13)

on the other hand, as discussed in [14,21,22,1],
the variation of the charge under an allowed
transformation is itself given by the commutator
of two charges,

j() = [j(), j()].

(14)

eqns. (13) and (14) show that the charge j sat-
ises an ane kac-moody algebra with central
charge k/2. the appearance of an ane algebra
at the boundary was rst pointed out in [23] in
relation to cs theory and the jones polynomial.
this derivation of the ane algebra is valid for
any group g. to apply these results to 3d gravity,
we consider the particular case g = sl(2,) 
sl(2,) and identify the cs coupling k with the
gravitational coupling (3).
the next step is to identify the origin of the
brown-henneaux virasoro symmetry in this dis-
cussion. given an ane algebra, there is a natu-
ral virasoro operator associated to it via the sug-
awara construction.
it was shown in [15] that
a twisted sugawara operator yields the correct
brown-henneaux algebra. the twisting is re-
lated to the radial dieomorphism (6) necessary
to bring the metric (5) back to its original form.
this derivation is however not complete because
it does not x the value of the central charge. in-
deed, from the purely cs point of view, the coe-
cient in the twisting can be arbitrary and thus the
central charge is arbitrary. a full derivation of the
conformal algebra in the cs formulation was pre-
sented in [16]. the idea is to use the reduction of
ane sl(2,r)k to virasoro discussed in [24]. this
follows by looking at the metric (2) and choos-
ing boundary conditions for the gauge eld such
that the associated metric has the asymptotic be-
haviour (2). these boundary conditions coincide

4

exactly with the reduction conditions considered
in [24]. the virasoro symmetry then follows in a
direct way with the correct value for the central
charge c = 6k.

the details of this derivation can be found in
[16]. see also [25,26] for a comparison with [15].

3. five dimensional chern-simons super-

gravity

3.1. the action

contrary to the three-dimensional case, the 5d
chern-simons (cs) supergravity action is quite
dierent from the standard theory. this theory
was rst studied in [6]; generalizations to other
dimensions have been studied in [27].

despite the nice geometrical properties of the
cs construction, this theory has one major draw-
back, namely, its connection with the real world.
for this theory to be phenomenologically rea-
sonable, i.e., related to some compactication of
11d supergravity or m theory, one should be
able to match its eld content with the usual
modes of 5d supergravity, namely, the graviton
h , a graviphoton a, plus some spinor elds
[28]. while the 5d cs action does contain elds
with those tensorial properties, their propagators
are not the standard ones.

we start by briey reviewing the construction

of the action [6].

for those familiar with the cs construction and
super lie algebras, it should be enough to say
that 5d cs supergravity is simply the integral
of a cs density for the supergroup su (2, 2|n ).
this supergroup is the smallest super extension
of so(4, 2), which is the group associated to the
pure gravitational part. it is, however, of some
pedagogical value to start from the purely grav-
itational piece and motivate the appearance of
u (2, 2) at the bosonic level. we refer the reader
to [6,3,27] for more details. in the following, we
assume some familiarity with the bosonic chern-
simons construction.

the purely gravitational piece contains the

so(4, 2) gauge eld

wg = eapa +

1
2

wabjab

(15)

where pa and jab are the so(4, 2) generators, and

ea and wab are the veilbein and spin connection
respectively. the subscript g refers to gravita-
tional. as usual when studying supergravity, we
consider the particular representation of so(4, 2)
obtained via dirac matrices,

pa =

1
2

a,

jab =

1
2

ab,

{a, b} = 2ab.

(16)

here ab is the anti-symmetrised product of dirac
matrices normalized by ab = ab for a 6= b. we
use the representation on which,

(17)

0 = i diag(1, 1,1,1),
and the signature is ab = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1). the
matrix 0 is anti-hermitian while the others a,
a 6= 0, are hermitian.
prove that

using the dirac matrix algebra it is direct to

(a0) = a0,

(ab0) = ab0.

(18)

in this

representation,

thus,
the gravita-
tional chern-simons eld wg = (1/2)(eaa +
(1/2)wabab) belongs
to the lie algebra of
su (2, 2) since

(w 0) = w 0,

(19)

and tr w = 0. what we have done is to dis-
cover that the lie algebras of so(4, 2) and
su (2, 2) are isomorphic. we note that although
in four dimensions the chern-simons action does
not exist, a similar analysis at the level of the lie
algebras, plus the existence of majorana spinors,
yields the relation between so(3, 2) and sp(4).

the group su (2, 2) admits a supersymmet-
ric extension. the rst step is to add an extra
bosonic piece a which induces a non-zero trace
but preserves (19). we consider the extended
u (2, 2) bosonic gauge eld,

w = ia i +

1
2

eaa +

1
4

wabab

(20)

where a is an abelian gauge eld and i is the
identity in the space of dirac matrices.

a motivation for the eld a can be found in [29]
where it was shown that, in the zero cosmologi-
cal constant case, this eld is enough to achieve
if the cosmological constant is
supersymmetry.

not zero, the structure of the supergroup in ve
dimensions induces extra bosonic su (n ) gauge
elds which however do not couple to the gravi-
tational variables.

the full 5d cs supergravity action has the form

[6,27]

isu(2,2|n ) = iu(2,2) + isu(n ) + fermionic
pieces + interaction terms.

(21)

we shall consider here the situation on which
all fermionic and su (n ) gauge elds are zero.
the action reduces to,

iu(2,2) = k(ig + ia + ii )

(22)

(24)

from the point of view of cs theory this last
term describes the interaction between the gravi-
tational variables and the abelian gauge eld a.
however, as we shall see soon, the kinetic term
for a is actually contained in (24).

k is a dimensionless number representing the
cs coupling, and l is the ads radius. the eec-
tive ve dimensional newton constant and cos-
mological constant are (up to numerical factors),

(26)

where r  r denotes the gauss-bonnet term,
r  r = r2  4rr + rr,

(27)

5

which in ve dimensions is not a total deriva-
tive. the rst two terms in (26) are of course
the usual einstein-hilbert and cosmological con-
stant pieces. our main goal in this note is to
analyse whether the quadratic interaction can be
discarded or not when expanding around some
background.

the motivation to look for phases on which the
piece r  r does not contribute is the existence
of another 5d supergravity action whose bosonic
part has the form [28],

isugra =z [g(r + f f ) + f f a].

(28)

(the exact coecients can be found in [28].) this
action is known to descend form eleven dimen-
sional supergravity via compactication2.

besides the obvious dierences between (22)
and (28), they do have one thing in common,
namely, they both contain the graviton ea
 and
an abelian gauge eld a with a cs term. actu-
ally, the name graviton for the eld ea
 is somehow
premature because, due to the quadratic gauss-
bonnet interactions, the spin connection is an in-
dependent eld in this theory [4]. in other words,
it is not true that the variation of ig with re-
spect to wab yields an algebraic equation. that
equation is in fact dierential and carry its own
dynamics. (although t a = 0 is still a solution,
at least in vacuum space.)

if we expect (22) and (28) to be related, we will
need to resort to some mechanism that can enable
us to discard the quadratic interactions in (22).
however, even if we could argue that the higher
order interactions are negligible in some limit, we
will then face the problem that the kinetic piece
for a in (22) is not the standard one.
in fact,
besides the abelian cs interaction, a does not
seem to have a kinetic piece at all! we shall see
that these two problems are closely related and
that if we can solve the rst, the second will be
solved automatically.

2it is amusing to note that there also exists a cs action
for supergravity in eleven dimensions [27] constructed with
the group osp(32|1) which, by the way, is believed to be
the symmetry group of m theory. somehow, cs theories
incorporate in a very natural way the kinematics of m
theory but not its dynamics. see [30] for a discussion on
11d cs supergravity and m-theory.

6

3.2. backgrounds

let us rst study whether one could neglect
the quadratic interaction terms in (26). we set
for the moment a = 0 and deal only with (23), or
in its metric form (26). as we shall see, this may
not be the right way to analyse this problem, but
it is a good starting point.

we shall study solutions to the equations of
motion with zero torsion. if the quadratic inter-
action was small in some limit, one would ex-
pect, for example, to nd solutions which asymp-
totically behave like ads-schwarzschild. a sit-
uation like this occurs in born-infeld electrody-
namics whose spherically symmetric solutions ap-
proach the standard coulomb potential. in that
case one can argue that at low energies the born-
infeld action reduces to the standard one. this
does not happen in cs gravity.

solutions with spherical symmetry for the ac-
tion (22), with a = 0, have been studied in [3].
the metric has the form,

ds2 = f (r)dt2 +

dr2
f (r)

+ r2d3

with

f (r) = c +

r2
l2 .

(29)

(30)

the parameter c is a constant of integration,
related to the cs-adm energy of the solution (see
below). if c = 1, this solution reduces to ads
space. for c 6= 1 there is a curvature singular-
ity at r = 0, however, if c > 0 this singularity is
protected by an event horizon. the metric (30)
is a natural generalization to higher dimensions
of the three dimensional black hole [17]. we note
in particular that the singularity is smoother that
the schwarzschild one. the curvature near r = 0
blows up as 1/r2 as opposed to schwarzschild in
ve dimensions which goes like 1/r4. further-
more, at the equator 1 = 2 = /2, the metric
(30) is exactly a three-dimensional black hole [17],
i.e., 3d anti-de sitter space with identications
[31].

the schwarzschild spacetime in ve dimensions
has the form (29) with fsch(r) = 1 + r2/l2 
2m/r2.
it is clear that f (r) given in (30) does
not approach fsch(r) at large values of r. we

conclude that asymptotically one cannot neglect
the quadratic term. at least not when expanding
around the anti-de sitter background.

the ads background seems to be the most nat-
ural choice for cs theory. however, as stressed in
[4,34], it is degenerate because there is no prop-
agation around it. indeed, the cs equations of
motion are,

abcde(rab +

1
l2 eaeb)(rcd +

1
l2 eced) = 0,
and the ads background satises rab + 1
l2 eaeb =
0. certainly there can be no linearized perturba-
tions around this background.

(31)

it has been shown in [4] that non-degenerate
backgrounds for the equations (31) do exists and
some examples were displayed explicitly in that
reference. however, those examples were rather
unphysical and did not have a geometrical moti-
vation.

in this contribution, we will change the point
of view. instead of changing the background, we
will change the action. the idea is to deform the
equations of motion a little bit such that propa-
gation around ads becomes non-trivial. in par-
ticular, we will modify the value of the cosmolog-
ical constant. hopefully, this deformation can be
achieved by turning on some of the other elds in
the theory and letting them to have a non-zero
vacuum expectation value. work in this direc-
tion is in progress [32]. here we shall motivate
this procedure and display its consequences.

we deform the cs equations (31) by adding a
little bit of cosmological constant of magnitude

abcde(rab +

deformed theory, there are two natural back-
grounds related by   . we choose rab +
eb = 0. expanding the equations of mo-
l2 ea
tion to rst order we nd
2(1  )

l2

eaeb(cid:21) eced = 0.

this equation coincides exactly with the lin-
earised perturbations following from the standard

einstein-hilbert action with a cosmological con-
stant. an important point, however, is the pres-
ence of the deformation parameter multiplying
(33). this theory has a deformed newton con-
stant g and ads radius l given by

g =

g


,

1
l2


=

(1  )

l2

.

(34)

in particular, we cannot let   0 without loos-
ing the contact with standard einstein equations.
we have thus shown that the dynamics of the
deformed cs theory expanded around the ads
background is described by the action,

7

into the equations (32) it is direct to see that the
only non-trivial equation is

h = 

1

4gf 1/2

d

dr "(cid:18) r2

l2  h(cid:19)2

 2 r4

l4# = 0. (38)

this equation is of course trivially integrated and
leads to (36). eq. (38) corresponds to the vari-
ation of the cs action with respect to the lapse
function n = (g00)1/2. indeed, h is the hamil-
tonian constraint which enters in the action as
h = r n h + e where e, the adm energy, is

a boundary term added to make h dierentiable
[14]. for this class of metrics, e is given by

i

g z g(cid:18)r +

l2

(cid:19) .

(35)

e =

let us now consider solutions with spherical
symmetry in the deformed theory. exact solu-
tions for the equations (32) with spherical sym-
metry and  not necessarily small are known [33].
they have the form (29) with,

f(r) = 1 +

r2

l2 r r4

l4 2 + 4m g.

(36)

if  = 0, we recover the previous solution with
c = 2m g 3. this solution is indeed asymptot-
ically schwarzschild since for large values of r, f
behaves as

f(r) = 1 +

r2
 
l2

2mg
r2 + o(

r6 ).

(37)

where g and l are given in (34), and m = m l2
is the adm mass. thus, asymptotically, the so-
lutions to (32) are indeed solutions to (35).

before leaving this section we would like to
analyse in some more detail the denition of the
adm energy in cs theories and in particular its
relation with the integration constant m .

a quick way to analyse this problem is to per-
form a minisuperspace reduction [3]. consider
the space of metrics of the form (29) for any func-
tion f . let f (r) = 1 + h(r). plugging the metric

3note that we have made choice in the sign in front of the
square root in order to ensure the existance of the horizon.
since the ads background has the opposite sign, it is not
in this sector of the space of solutions. this reminds the
three-dimensional situation on which ads belongs to a
dierent class of topologies [31].

(39)

here we have adjusted a constant such that e = 0
on the ads background h(ads) = (1  )r2/l2.
the value of e on the solution (36) is e = m
showing that the parameter m is indeed the cs-
adm energy.

it is instructive to look separately at each piece
in (38) and (39). consider (r2h)2 = r42hr2 +
h2. the piece r4 is the contribution to the cosmo-
logical constant to the hamiltonian 4. the piece
r2h is the contribution from the einstein hilbert
term, giving a nite contribution for perturba-
tions of the form 1/r2. finally, the piece h2 is
the contribution to the hamiltonian coming from
the gauss-bonnet quadratic interaction.

3.3. the gauge eld propagator

we have shown in the last paragraph that
the quadratic interactions in the cs lagrangian,
in general, cannot be neglected. however, we
have also noticed that a small deformation in the
value of the cosmological constant did produce an
asymptotically schwarzschild solution and more
generally, a set of perturbations described by
standard gr with the renormalised couplings
(34). this means that asymptotically, the de-
formed action is controlled by the hilbert piece
and, in that case, one can neglect the quadratic
piece, provided one renormalises newton constant

its symmetries are broken.

appropriately. deforming the cosmological term
means that the cs structure is lost, and in par-
ticular,
(actually,
only the ads translational symmetry is broken;
dieomorphisms and lorentz rotations are not
aected.) we loose the nice geometrical prop-
erties but we gain a phenomenological space of
solutions, namely, asymptotically schwarzschild
spacetimes.

as further motivation to consider breaking the
chern-simons symmetry, we shall now show that
on this phase, the abelian gauge eld a which en-
ters in the cs action (22) in a rather strange form,
becomes the usual u (1) electromagnetic eld.

we shall prove that if we discard the terms
with more that two derivatives in (24), in partic-
ular the gauss-bonnet interaction, then the term
d(eat e)a appearing in (24) is exactly equivalent
to the quadratic propagator gf f .
the mechanism leading to the appearance of
f  f through a rst order action is actually a
general feature of p-forms in p+ 4 dimensions and
can be described aside of the supergravity action.
the simplest example occurs in four dimensions
with a 0-form (scalar) coupled to gravity via the
action,

where t a = dea is the torsion tensor5. the
scalar eld  appears in (40) with no derivatives.
we shall now show that (40) is equivalent to the

standard r g(r + ()2) action.

since eat a is linear in the spin connection, its
variation is independent of it. the equation of
motion that follows from varying (40) with re-
spect to wab

 is an algebraic equation

eat a

 = 

(41)

which can be solved for wab
 . the spin connection
separates in the torsion-free part plus a torsion
contribution

wab

 = wab

 (e) + eaeb

(42)

5the combination d(eat a) = t ata + rabea
eb is some-
times called the nieh-yan invariant. its relation to chiral
anomalies in four dimensions has been discussed in [35].

here w(e) is the standard formula that follows
from t a = 0. we now eliminate w by replacing
its on-shell value back in the action. an straight-
forward calculation shows that one indeed obtains
the standard scalar eld action coupled to grav-
ity. a quick way to convince ourselves that this is
true is by considering the equation of motion
following from (40),

d(eat a) = 0.

(43)

replacing (41) in this equation one derives the
correct scalar eld equation (gg) = 0.
the key property of (40) is that it does not need
the metric tensor explicitly to achieve dieomor-
phism invariance. this is a characteristic feature
of chern-simons lagrangians. the action (40)
can be regarded as a rst order formulation of an
scalar eld couple to gravity. the metric is not
explicitly needed (although present through the
tetrad eld) and in that sense (40) is topological.
this construction can be generalised to higher
dimensional situations involving p-forms. the
next case is precisely the action (24) on which we
neglect the quadratic pieces in the riemann cur-
vature. the chern- simons interaction f f a does
not depend on the spin connection. the variation
with respect to the spin connection then yields

eliminating the spin connection one recovers the

standard coupling r g(r + f  f ) (plus the

f f a interaction). again, a quick way to check
this assertion is by considering the variation of
the action with respect to a which yields again
d(ea t a) = 0. since the torsion equation deter-
mines eat a = f , the above equation becomes
df = 0, as desired. this mechanism leading to
the standard propagator for the gauge eld has al-
ready appeared in the group manifold approach
to ve-dimensional supergravity [36].

the coupling of a pform in d = 4 + p di-
mensions can be treated in a unied way in
this fashion. the eld equation will always be
d(ea t a) = 0 which, supplemented with the tor-
sion equation ea t a = fp+1, yields dfp+1 = 0
as desired. we end by mentioning that this mech-
anism is well-known in the string theory litera-
ture. the axion eld b sometimes called the

i[e, w, ] =z abcdrab

torsion receives this name precisely because it
can be absorbed into the spin connection as we
have described here.

4. conclusions and open problems

we have shown in this contribution that de-
forming ve dimensional cs supergravity leads
to a new theory which is closer to standard gravi-
tational theories. there are many open problems
which we have not touched here. most impor-
tantly, we have not really proved that the de-
formed theory reduces to the standard supergrav-
ity theory, but only checked that the bosonic de-
grees of freedom have the usual dynamics.
it
would be very interesting to see whether the full
cs supergravity action admits a deformation such
that, for some value of the parameter, it repro-
duces the standard supergravity action. note
that supersymmetry xes all relative coecients
and thus this would uncover a curious relation
between cs and standard supergravity.

it is a great pleasure to thank the organizers
of qg99 for the invitation to participate in the
last quantum gravity meeting of the millennium.
besides the great environment and fruitful discus-
sions that i enjoyed during the conference, i also
had the undeserved privilege to win a bottle of
good sardinian wine for which i am most grate-
ful.
i would also like to thank andrew cham-
blin, fernando falceto, gary gibbons, marc hen-
neaux, ricardo troncoso and matt visser for use-
ful conversations. financial support from ci-
cyt (spain) grant aen-97-1680, and the span-
ish postdoctoral program of ministerio de edu-
cacion y cultura is also acknowledge.
