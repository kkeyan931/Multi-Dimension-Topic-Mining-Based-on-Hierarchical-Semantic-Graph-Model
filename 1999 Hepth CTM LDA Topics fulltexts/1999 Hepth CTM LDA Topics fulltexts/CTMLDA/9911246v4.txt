abstract

there is a close relation between classical supergravity and quantum sym
descriptions of interactions between separated branes. in the case of d3 branes
the equivalence of leading-order potentials is due to non-renormalization of the
f 4 term in n = 4 sym theory. here we point out the existence of another
special non-renormalized term in quantum sym eective action. this term re-
produces the interaction potential between electric charge of a d3-brane probe
and magnetic charge of a d3-brane source, represented by the chern-simons
part of the d-brane action. this unique wess-zumino term depends on all six
scalar elds and originates from a phase of the euclidean fermion determinant
in sym theory. it is manifestly scale invariant (i.e.
is the same for large and
small separations between branes) and can not receive higher loop corrections
in gauge theory. maximally supersymmetric sym theories in d = p + 1 > 4
contain mixed wz terms which depend on both scalar and gauge eld back-
grounds, and which reproduce the corresponding cs terms in the supergravity
interaction potentials between separated dp-branes for p > 3. purely scalar
wz terms appear in other cases, e.g., in half less supersymmetric gauge the-
ories in various dimensions describing magnetic interactions between dp and
d(6  p) branes.

1 introduction

the duality between the supergravity and the world-volume descriptions of d-branes
has led to important advances in understanding of dynamics of supersymmetric gauge
theories. many aspects of interactions of d-branes which are transparent in the su-
pergravity description, translate into quite non-trivial properties of the world-volume
eld theory. the electric and gravitational interactions between branes have been
widely studied in this context (see, e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and references there). the
agreement between the supergravity and the sym descriptions of leading-order inter-
actions between branes can be traced to the universal non-renormalization properties
of the f 4 terms in the eective action of maximally supersymmetric gauge theories
in various dimensions [7, 8].

we shall discuss magnetic interactions. the prime case of interest in connection
with 4-d gauge theories is a d3 brane moving in the background of other d3 branes.
the self-duality of the rr ve-form eld strength implies that a d3 brane carries both
electric and magnetic charges. as a consequence, the probe brane will experience the
lorentz force, similar to the one an electric charge experiences in the magnetic eld of
a monopole. for example, the action of a d3-brane probe moving in a supergravity
background produced by a d3-brane source contains [9, 10, 11] the chern-simons

term r4 c4 = r5 f5 which describes the interaction of an electric charge of the probe

with the electric and the magnetic elds produced by the source. in the static gauge,
the electric interaction produces the eective -1 contribution to the p-even born-
infeld part of the d3-brane action s = sbi + s(el)

this term ensures the vanishing of the interaction potential between static parallel

have non-trivial gradients.

since many features of the magnetic d3 brane interaction are similar to those
of the lorentz interaction between an electric charge and a magnetic monopole, let
us briey review some facts about the latter case. the lorentz force acting on the
charge in the eld of magnetic monopole is

the dirac string singularity of the gauge potential for the monopole eld does not
allow the lorentz force to be a variation of a well-dened local action functional.
the variational principle for a charged particle interacting with a monopole can be
formulated only by adding the non-local wess-zumino term to the action

here the integration is over a domain whose boundary is the time axis. then the
variation of the wz action reproduces the lorentz force: swz/xi = f i.

according to the standard argument, there is an ambiguity in the denition of
the wz action, because xi is dened at the boundary of the integration domain
and can be continued into the interior in an arbitrary way. since the integrand is
locally a total derivative, this ambiguity is discrete, in the sense that the values of
the action for dierent continuations dier by an integer multiple of qeqm. despite
the multi-valuedness of the action, the path integral remains single-valued, provided
qeqm is an integer multiple of 2. the consistency of the quantum mechanics of an
electrically charged particle thus leads to the dirac quantization condition for the
magnetic charge: qm = 2n/qe.

the lorentz force experienced by a d3 brane in the background of another d3

brane (with both branes having unit charges) is

here xi(x) parametrize the position of the probe brane in the 6-d space transverse to
the source brane as a function of the 4 longitudinal coordinates x. the lorentz force
can be represented as a variation of the ve-dimensional integral (m = 0, 1, ..., 5):2

2the wz term can be written also as a 4-d integral of a local functional by using spherical s 5

coordinates instead of cartesian x i (see [13]).

2

where ni = xi
|x| parametrize s5 = so(6)/so(5). this action is dened up to 2,
which reects the fact that a d3 brane carries one unit of the quantized magnetic
charge.

this topological term is scale-invariant and does not depend on gauge coupling.
its coecient cannot be renormalized since any non-trivial dependence on the dilaton
would break gauge invariance. also, as for many other wz terms, the renormaliza-
tion of its coecient would contradict the topological magnetic charge quantization
condition.3 like the one-loop f 4 term, this wz term should thus be a rare example
of an exact non-renormalized sym interaction.4

the scale (x  ax) invariance and the topological nature of the above wz term
suggests that it should follow from the string-theory description of d-brane interaction
at both large (supergravity) and small (gauge theory) distance regions. the non-
renormalization of the coecient of this term implies that it should be present in the
eective action of quantum n = 4 su(n) sym theory on the coulomb branch of
the moduli space in both weak and strong coupling regions.

therefore, it should be expected, both from the weakly coupled string theory
long-distanceshort-distance duality [1] and the ads/cft duality [16], that, like
the p-even f 4/x 4+superpartners term in sbi, this p-odd term should be exactly
reproduced by the 1-loop computation on the n = 4 sym theory side.

our aim below is to conrm this expectation by the explicit computation of the
imaginary part of the fermion determinant in the sym theory. as far as we are
aware, the derivation of this d = 4 wz term from n = 4 sym theory was missing in
the literature (the calculations presented in [20, 21], though similar, led to a dierent
class of cs terms, see below). that this term should have, by analogy with the case
discussed in [17], a berry phase interpretation was suggested to one of us (a.t.) by
m. douglas (for some related work in the context of matrix models see also [18]).

our direct perturbative derivation of the wz term (6) in the eective action of
n = 4 sym theory described below in section 2 will not be referring to the berry
phase. we will show that the wz term originate from the same hexagon diagram
which is responsible for the chiral anomaly in ten-dimensional sym theory [19].

3 assuming that there are no phase transitions in the coupling constant, the coecient should

be a smooth function of the coupling, but an integer valued smooth function must be a constant.

4the two terms may, in fact, be related by a non-linear part of maximal d = 10 supersymmetry
as is suggested by the existence of the action for a d3-brane in ads5  s 5 space constructed in [14],
where the bi and cs terms in the action are related by the -symmetry. also, there seems to be a
close analogy with the f 4 and 10f 4c2 terms in the type i superstring 1-loop eective action which
are related by d = 10 supersymmetry and obey a non-renormalization theorem [15].

3

in section 3 we will describe a similar computation of counterparts of the ten-
dimensional anomaly graph in other supersymmetric gauge theories describing sys-
tems of separated dp branes with p > 3. in contrast to the d = 4 sym case (and
some of its analogs discussed below) where the wz term is purely scalar and does
not have a local representation, the hexagon graphs in d > 4 lead to a dierent
class of wz terms which involve both scalars and vectors and admit a local cs-type
representation. this class of wz terms was previously derived from sym theories in
[20, 21].

section 4 will contain some concluding remarks.

2 wess-zumino term in the d = 4 n = 4 sym

theory

the wz term is odd in time derivatives, so it has a factor of i in the euclidean action
(below we choose the euclidean signature of the metric). the eective action induced
by the bosonic sym degrees of freedom is real, so the only potential source of the
imaginary wz term is the (gauge-invariant, o(6) invariant and conformal-invariant)
phase of the fermion determinant. the appearance of a wz term in the phase of a
fermion determinant is not unusual, and examples of chiral wzw terms induced by
fermionic loop are known [22, 23]. the present case of scalar elds interacting with
fermions in n = 4 d = 4 sym theory was not explicitly discussed before.

the part of the 1-loop eective action in n = 4 sym theory which is induced by

the 4 weyl fermions has the following form (after continuation to euclidean space)

sferm =

here m are ten-dimensional dirac matrices:

{m , n } = 2m n ,

(m ) = m ,

11  i0 . . . 9 .

(8)

we assume that the 10-d indices are split in the 4+6 way, m = (, i), and that the
d = 4 vector eld has trivial background. generalization to the case of non-trivial
a background in d > 4 is straightforward (see [20, 21] and section 3 below), but
in the case of n = 4 sym theory the wz term happens to depend only on the six
scalar elds.

the system of n slowly moving separated d3 branes is represented by slowly

varying diagonal scalar elds:

i =

.

(9)

the commutator term in the dirac operator in this background vanishes for diagonal
components of fermions, and for non-diagonal it becomes [i, ]ab = (x a
i )ab.
the eective action thus decomposes into a sum of pairwise interactions:

i  x b

sferm = xa<b

s(x a  x b) ,

where

s(x) =  tr"ln(cid:16)0 + i0ixi(cid:17) 1 + 11

taking the variation, we nd (sp is the trace in spinor indices):

x+ i 1 + 11

2

# .

we are interested in the imaginary part of the eective action. since the operator
i  jxj is hermitean, and i(1 + 11) = (1  11)i, taking the dierence of
the above expression and its complex conjugate it is easy to see that

(12)

for slowly varying elds, this expression can be expanded in derivatives of xi. the
term with n derivatives will be proportional to the trace of 2n + 3 dirac matrices.
since this trace contains 11, and

sp(cid:16)m1 . . . mk11(cid:17) = 0

for k < 10 ,

(13)

the expansion wil start with the four derivative term coming from the diagram (dashed

for the case of a single d3 brane interacting with a cluster of n coinciding d3 branes
we get sferm = ns(x), and thus rederive the magnetic chern-simons term in the d3
brane probe action directly from the gauge theory.

the imaginary part of the sym eective action contains higher-derivative cor-
rections which are not seen on the supergravity side. the conformal symmetry of
n = 4 sym implies that the extra derivatives are necessarily accompanied by extra
powers of 1/|x|, and so the higher-derivative terms are no longer invariant under
the rescaling x  x/. from the supergravity point of view one may interpret
these terms as being eectively of higher order in . indeed, the long-distance or
closed string channel representation of the full stringy expression for the d3-brane
interaction amplitude should contain, in particular, all massless mode (sym) 1-loop
corrections of the open string channel.

3 wz terms in d > 4 sym theories

the d = 4 case discussed in the previous section is special in that the wz term
there depends only on the scalar elds. an analogous but actually dierent class of
magnetic wz terms appears in the eective actions of maximally supersymmetric
sym theories in higher dimensions 4 < d = p + 1 < 9 [20, 21]. for d > 4 one needs
to switch also a non-trivial gauge eld background in order to get a non-zero result for
the imaginary part of the fermionic determinant. this has a natural interpretation on
the supergravity side: while d3 branes carry both electric and magnetic charges and
thus their interaction potential contains magnetic contribution, separated magnetic

6

(p > 3) dp-branes interact only electrically, unless one switches on a gauge eld
background which induces eective electric charges on the dp brane probe.

for example, the action of a d5 brane probe moving in the d5 brane background

contains the cs term (i = 1, 2, 3, 4)

(17)

where dc2 is the (magnetic) gauge eld strength of the d5 brane source. the cor-
responding wz term indeed arises in the eective action of d = 6 sym theory
describing multiple d5 branes.

let us consider the general case of the maximal sym theory obtained by dimen-
sional reduction of d = 10 sym theory to d = p + 1 < 10, and couple the fermions
to both the diagonal scalar background (9) and the abelian gauge eld background
( = 0, 1, 2, ..., p)

as in the p = 3 case (10), the fermionic contribution to the 1-loop eective action

where now

s(x, a) =  tr"ln(cid:16)0 + i0a + i0ixi(cid:17) 1 + 11

(19)

the rst term in the derivative expansion of the imaginary part of this action comes
from the hexagon diagram and has the form similar to eq. (14) with (p+1)-dimensional
momentum integral instead of 4-dimensional one and with some of the scalar elds
replaced by the gauge potentials.

the contribution of the hexagon diagram in various dimensions 5  d  9 was
shown to give rise to local chern-simons terms in the eective action [20]. below we
rederive these chern-simons terms and clarify their relation to the wz actions.

if p  7, we can take a variation with respect to the scalar eld to get:

as a result, the eective action contains the term:

im s = dpz dp+2x 0...p+1jk0...k7p

|x|9p xj 0xk0 . . . 7p xk7pf8p9p . . . fpp+1 ,

or, equivalently (ni = xi/|x|)

im s = dp 2p3 z i1...i9p ni1 dni2  . . .  dni9p(f )p3 .

(22)

(23)

this expression reduces to our previous d = 4 sym result (6) in the case of p = 3.
for p = 5 this wz term reproduces the cs interaction (17) in the supergravity
description.

note that the nonlocal nature of the action (23) is fake. since f = da, we can
integrate by parts and that leads to the local chern-simons form given in [20]. for

example, the local cs form of (17) is r6 dc2(x)  f  a. this integration by parts

is not possible in the case of purely scalar wz terms.

like the cs terms in the dp brane actions, the wz terms with dierent p in (23)

are related by dimensional reduction (smearing and t-duality, ai  xi).

instead of computing the variation of the eective action over xi, another way to

obtain these mixed wz terms is to calculate the induced current [20]

j  =

 im s
a

.

(24)

for p = 9 the divergence of this current produces the chiral anomaly [19], which makes
the ten-dimensional non-abelian sym theory inconsistent. for p = 8, the induced
current is5

j  =

122884 sgn(x) 1...8f12 . . . f78 ,

sgn(x) =

.

(25)

5if x = 0 somewhere, this current is not conserved:

j  =

1

122884 (x) 01...8 0 xf12 . . . f78 .

the equation x = 0 determines a domain wall in the nine-dimensional theory, which appears in any
eld congation satisfying boundary conditions x  x0 at x1  , though these domain walls
do not exist as classical solutions, because there is no potential for x. it is known that domain walls
support fermion zero modes independently of the wall prole. as a consequence, the eective 8d
eld theory on the wall contains chiral fermions, which make the eective theory anomalous. the
chiral anomaly of the fermion zero modes on the wall exactly compensates the divergence of the
current j  [24]. the hypersurface x = 0 corresponds to the intersection of the d8-branes. the

in [21] it was suggested that the theory of multiple m5 branes should contain a
|x|5 x idx j dx k dx l dx m , cs
similar mixed r6 b2 h4(x), h4(x) = ijklm
term related by compactication on s1 to the r5 a  h4(x) cs term in d = 5 sym

(multiple d4 brane) theory, and the one-loop microscopic derivation (equivalent to
the one in [20]) of the latter term was given.

1

analogous wz terms are found in other d-brane interaction systems described
by gauge theories with less than maximal supersymmetry. for example, pure-scalar
wz terms appear in the case of dpd(6-p) (electric-magnetic) brane interaction. it
is possible to see that in the case of the d5d1 system6 described by a particular
n = 4, d = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory [28], the relevant fermion determinant
1
|x|4 xidxj  dxk  dxl which reproduces the cs term
contains the wz term r3 ijkl
r2 c2 in the action of a d-string probe moving in the magnetic background produced

by a d5-brane source. the same term can be obtained by starting with the d5d5
system with the wz term (17), and compactifying 4 parallel directions on a torus

and assuming that the gauge eld background has a non-zero magnetic ux r4 f  f

representing the d1-brane charge. this is a particular example of (t-duality) relations
between dierent magnetic wz terms in (23).

the abelian wz terms discussed above have natural non-abelian generalizations.
in particular, they should reproduce the non-abelian cs terms in multiple d-brane
action given in [29].7

let us note also that sym theories dened on curved d-dimensional spaces should
contain curvature-dependent wz terms similar to (23) with f replaced by r (and
other mixed terms). they should reproduce the corresponding r-dependent cs terms

[30, 11, 31] in the dp-brane actions (for example, r6 r  r  c2 in d5 brane case).
total inow of the electric charge into the intersection is equal to the chern class c4(f ) r (f )4,
case discussed in [25, 26], since the magnetic ux r (f )4 on one of the d8-branes represents a

d0-brane charge. thus the above phenomenon is a reection of string creation phenomenon when
d0 passes through d8 [26].

where f is a (relative) magnetic eld on the d8 branes. this is essentially equivalent to the d8d0

6related case of m5m2 magnetic interaction was considered in [17]. d6-d0 system was discussed

in [27].

7additional [x,x] factors originate from internal components of fij , i.e. these cs term may be

related by dimensional reduction and t-duality to r tr(f  ...  f )  c2 + ... cs terms in d9 brane

action.

4 discussion

we have shown that the 1-loop eective action of d = 4 n = 4 sym theory
contains the unique wz term (6) coming from the phase of the euclidean fermion
determinant. the presence of this term (and of its d > 4 analogs (22)) is related to
the existence of chiral anomaly in d = 10 sym theory. this term depends only on 6
scalar elds, is manifestly so(6) and conformal invariant, and its coecient should
not be renormalized by higher loop corrections.

one interesting open question is how to construct a supersymmetric generalization
of this term. the answer does not seem obvious since the use of either n = 1 or
n = 2 supereld formulation of n = 4 sym theory breaks the so(6) symmetry.
the wz term (6) is actually the integral part of the space-time supersymmetric and
-symmetric action [14] for a d3 brane propagating in ads5  s5 vacuum of type
iib supergravity. as in the similar superstring action case [32], this term must be
added to the born-infeld part (1) of the action to ensure its -symmetry. fixing
the static gauge and a -symmetry gauge in the action of [14] in a suitable way one
should be able to read o the 4-d supersymmetric form of this wz term. after the
gauge xing, half of the original 32 superconformal symmetry generators become non-
linearly realized, and they should be relating the wz term to the terms in the bi
part of the action.

it should be possible to rederive this wz term directly from string theory, by tak-
ing an appropriate   0 limit in the 1-loop expression for the interaction potential
between two separated d3-branes. the topological nature of this term suggests that
it should be originating from certain fermionic zero mode contribution.

similar purely scalar magnetic wz term r3 c3 appears in the classical action of

m2 brane moving in the background of an m5 brane source. though lack of detailed
understanding of the theory of multiple m-branes prohibits us from deriving this term
directly from a microscopic theory (as was possible in the d-brane case), it is natural
to expect (by analogy with a related proposal about a cs term in the m5 brane
theory action [21]) that this wz term is again universal, i.e. is not renormalized.

the magnetic wz terms are present also in some orbifold theories [33]. for
example, they appear in the eld theory on a stack of an equal number of electric and
magnetic d3-branes in type 0 string theory [34], which is a z2 orbifold of n = 4 sym
[35]. this theory has two sets of scalar elds, x(el) and x(mg), which correspond to the
transverse coordinates of the electric and the magnetic branes. the yukawa couplings
in the diagonal background of these scalar elds are abi(x a
(mg))iab [36]. this

yukawa interaction induces a wz term depending on the dierence x a

same prediction (cs term in the interaction potential) should follow from the gravity
description, since there should be a lorentz force between the separated electric and
