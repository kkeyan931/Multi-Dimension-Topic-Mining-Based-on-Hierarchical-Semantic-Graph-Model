abstract

in the context of the ads/cft correspondence, we perform a direct
computation in ads5 supergravity of the trace anomaly of a d = 4,
n = 2 scft. we nd agreement with the eld theory result up to
next to leading order in the 1/n expansion. in particular, the order
n gravitational contribution to the anomaly is obtained from a rie-
mann tensor squared term in the 7-brane eective action deduced from
heterotic - type i duality. we also discuss, in the ads/cft context,
the order n corrections to the trace anomaly in d = 4, n = 4 scfts
involving so or sp gauge groups.

introduction

recently, a lot of work has been done on the conjectured [1] ads/cft corre-
spondence between string theory or m-theory compactications on adsd+1
and d-dimensional conformal eld theories.
in particular, this conjecture
relates [2, 3] correlation functions of local operators in the conformal eld
theory to amplitudes in the bulk string theory or m-theory, with the bound-
ary values of the bulk elds interpreted as sources coupling to the operators
of the boundary conformal eld theory.
an example of particular interest is the conjectured equivalence between
n = 4, d = 4 supersymmetric su (n ) yang-mills theory and type iib su-
perstring theory on ads5  s5 (with n units of rr ve-form f (5) ux on
s5). this duality identies the complex gauge coupling constant

the radius of s5 (or the curvature radius of ads5) is

with s the string length, 2

to the sym parameters by

(1.4)

correlation functions of string theory on ads5  s5 are given by a double
expansion in gs and /l2, which can be written as a double expansion in
terms of 1/n = 4gs(/l2)2 and 1/2. for closed oriented strings this
is actually an expansion in even powers of n , the string theory tree-level
(supergravity) contribution being of order n 2.
correlation functions of the sym theory, on the other hand, have a 1/n
expansion, valid when n is large, g2
y m is small, and  is kept nite (and
small). for su (n ) theories with adjoint elds only, this is once again an
expansion in even powers of n , the leading contributions, of order n 2,
coming from planar diagrams.

1

according to the (strong form of the) ads/cft correspondence, these two
theories should give rise to the same function of  at each order in n .
however, as one has an expansion in terms of  (weak t hooft coupling)
and the other in terms of 1/2 (the  or, better, /l2, expansion of string
theory), in practice this comparison is restricted to the rather limited set of
quantities which are -independent, such as global anomalies.
leading order n 2 contributions to the chiral anomalies were checked in e.g.
[3, 4], and trace anomalies were discussed (at the linearized level) in [5] by
comparing the bulk supergravity action with the eective action arising from
the coupling of n = 4 sym to n = 4 conformal supergravity.
the complete leading order holographic weyl anomaly was determined in
general in [6]. in particular, it was found there that the leading supergravity
contribution to the trace anomaly involves only the squares of the ricci
tensor and ricci scalar of the boundary metric and not the square of the
riemann tensor itself. this implies that conformal eld theories with a
standard (product space) supergravity dual necessarily have a = c to leading
order in n , where a and c are the coecients of the euler and weyl terms
in the standard expression

ht 

i = ae4  ci4

(1.5)

for the conformal anomaly. in [7] the calculations of [6] have been generalized
to dilatonic gravity.
the check of subleading corrections in the 1/n 2 expansion is hampered
by the fact that, for closed string theory, these correspond to string loop
corrections with rr background elds which are still not well understood.1
however, as pointed out in [9], certain subleading 1/n corrections (i.e. terms
of order n ) in theories with open or unoriented strings, corresponding to
so(n ) or sp(n ) gauge theories, may be accessible. in [9] an n = 2 super-
conformal eld theory arising from d3-branes on a z2 orientifold o7-plane
with d7-branes [10] was analyzed. in particular, in a rather subtle analysis
it was shown that the order n contribution to the chiral u (1) r-current
anomaly, proportional to (a  c), is correctly reproduced in the dual super-
gravity theory on ads5x 5, where x 5 = s5/z2 [11], by bulk chern-simons
couplings on the d7 and o7 world-volumes.
by supersymmetry, this chiral anomaly is related to the trace anomaly and
therefore indirectly [9] also conrms the ads/cft correspondence for the

conformal anomaly to this order in the large n expansion. the purpose
of this note is to perform a direct calculation of the trace anomaly along
the lines of [6]. by chasing the chern-simons couplings from type i theory
back to ten dimensions, we see that they originate from the green-schwarz
couplings h 2 = (db + l + . . .)2 in the heterotic string. these terms are
known to be related by supersymmetry to cp even r2-terms proportional
to the riemann tensor squared and f 2-terms for the gauge group so(8) 
so(32) [12, 13].
by using heterotic - type i duality and t-dualizing to type i, we show that
these terms give rise to order n riemann tensor and gauge eld strength
squared terms in eight dimensions leading to a subleading order n contri-
bution to the conformal anomaly upon reduction to ads5. we then show
that the external gauge eld contribution and the crucial coecient of the
riem2-term of the boundary metric in the conformal anomaly, proportional
to (a  c), are precisely reproduced by the supergravity calculation.
we also nd other terms of order n , proportional to the squares of the ricci
tensor and ricci scalar. this particular linear combination diers from that
of the eld theory result precisely by a term of order n attributable to an
eective ve-dimensional cosmological constant. we have been unable to
determine this contribution because of our ignorance regarding other four-
derivative terms in the type i theory like (f (5))4 and r(f (5))2. conversely,
comparing the supergravity calculation with the known eld theory result
gives a concrete (but not in itself particularly interesting) prediction for the
1/n contribution to the eective cosmological constant in this theory.
another class of theories with subleading order n corrections to the trace
anomaly are n = 4 sym theories with orthogonal or symplectic gauge
groups. these can be realized as low-energy theories on d3-branes at an
orientifold o3-plane and a candidate for their supergravity dual is tpye iib
string theory on an ads5  rp5 orientifold. at rst, these theories appear
to present a puzzle as there are no d-branes or o-planes wrapping the ads5
and therefore there can be no orientifold or open string corrections to the
bulk theory. we will show that both the leading and the subleading order
n contributions to the anomaly are correctly reproduced by the classical
einstein action by taking into account the (fractional) rr charge of the
o3-plane.
in section 2, we review the cft side of the gravitational and external gauge
eld contributions to the conformal anomaly. in section 3, we deduce the
relevant r2 and f 2 terms in the ads5 supergravity action via heterotic -
type i - type i duality. in section 4, we review the calculation of the leading

3

o(n 2) contribution to the trace anomaly following [6]. we then deduce the
o(n ) contributions by extending the analysis of [6] to include the r2 and
f 2 terms (section 5). in section 6 we discuss the n = 4 sym theories for
so and sp gauge groups, and we conclude with a discussion of the missing
contributions due to an eective cosmological constant of order n .

2 the trace anomaly on the cft side

the eld theory of interest is [9] an n = 2 superconformal eld theory with
sp(n ) gauge group, and 4 fundamental and one antisymmetric traceless
hypermultiplet. it arises [10] as the low-energy theory on the world volume
on n d3-branes sitting inside eight d7-branes at an o7-plane. among the
global symmetries of the theory there are an so(8)-symmetry (from the d7-
branes) as well as an su (2)u (1) r-symmetry of the n = 2 superconformal
algebra. taking the near-horizon limit of this conguration one nds [11]
that the conjectural string theory dual of this theory is type iib string theory
on ads5  x 5 where x 5 = s5/z2 in which the d7 and o7 ll the ads5 and
are wrapped around an s3 which is precisely the xed point locus of the z2.
because of the z2 action, the relation between the ve-form ux n and the
curvature radius of ads5 is now

l = (8gsn )1/4s

(2.1)

instead of (1.3). we will set s = 1 in the following.
the trace anomaly, when the theory is coupled to an external metric, is

where, using shorthand notation,

(2.13)

this is exactly twice the n = 4 result and this is in accordance with the
expected [6, 14] relation between volumes, vol(s5) versus vol(x 5), and the
leading contribution to the anomaly. on the supergravity side this term
arises [6] from a regularization of the (divergent) classical gravity action
which is just a volume integral in this case as the ads scalar curvature
(the einstein-hilbert lagrangian) is constant for ads5. we will review this
calculation below.
the subleading o(n )-term is

6n

24  162 [riem2 + 2ric2  r2]

.

(2.14)

we will show that, modulo undetermined volume terms of the form (2.13)
(with coecients of order n rather than n 2), this term arises from a rie-
mann curvature squared term in the bulk gravity action (with the precise
numerical coecient deduced from that appearing in the heterotic string
through heterotic - type i - type i duality).
one can also couple the theory to external gauge elds of a avour sym-
metry group g.
in general, the contribution of gauge elds to the trace
anomaly has been shown in [15] to be proportional to the beta-function of
the corresponding gauge coupling constant. the result obtained in [15] is

here rf,s are the representations of g on the (dirac) fermions and (complex)
scalars respectively, and t (r) is the dynkin index of the representation r,

trr tatb = t (r)ab .

(2.17)

to apply this result in the present situation we note the following. first of
all, in euclidean space there is a minus sign on the right hand side of (2.15),
as can be seen by tracing through the derivation in [15, section 3]. moreover,
for an external gauge eld, the rst term on the right hand side of (2.16) is of
course absent. in the present case, we can choose g = so(8), and the only
elds that are charged under g are the 8n fundamental hypermultiplets in

6

the fundamental representation of so(8). as an n = 2 hypermultiplet in
four dimensions consists of one dirac fermion and two complex scalars, the
contribution of external so(8) gauge elds to the trace anomaly is

ht 

ig = 

n t (8)
162 f a

.

(2.18)

we have dropped the factor g2 because we will be working with the scaled
gauge elds in terms of which the action takes the form s = (1/4g2)r f 2 +

. . ..
we see that this term is also of order n , and we will show that this contribu-
tion to the anomaly is reproduced precisely by an f 2-term in the heterotic
- type i action or, alternatively, by the f 2-term of the dirac-born-infeld
d7-brane action (wrapped on the s3  x 5).
3 the r2 and f 2 terms

in [9], the relevant chern-simons terms in the ads5 bulk action arose from
terms proportional to

z c (4)  tr(  ) ,z c (4)  tr(f  f ) ,

(3.1)

in the world volume theory of the d7-branes and o7-planes, where  is the
riemann curvature two-form, f denotes the so(8) gauge eld and c (4) is
the rr 4-form coupling to the d3-brane. t-dualizing these terms to type
i, the rr 4-form becomes a six-form c (6) coupling to the type i 5-brane.
writing this interaction as f (7)  l,y m , where l,y m is the lorentz /
yang-mills chern-simons term, and dualizing f (7) = db, we see that this
term arises from the modication

h 2 = (db + ll  y m y m )2

(3.2)

of the b-eld kinetic term in the type i and heterotic supergravity actions
required by the green-schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism.
now it is known [12, 13] that supersymmetry relates this term to a four-
derivative cp even term rlm n p rlm n p in the ten-dimensional heterotic
action together with the so(32) yang-mills term. the relevant part of the
heterotic action for our purposes is thus

(r +

(rlm n p rlm n p  f a

(3.3)

7

we will now rst check explicitly that these two terms in the end give rise to
terms of order n 2 and n in the ads supergravity action respectively. we
will determine the precise numerical factors below.
first of all, using the rules of heterotic - type i duality,

z d10xgi (e2i
notice that the riemann tensor square term comes with exp() rather
than with exp(2). this indicates that it arises from disc (d9-branes) and
crosscap (orientifold o9-planes) world-sheets and not from the sphere. the
latter was to be expected since the sphere calculation is identical to that in
iib where one knows that there is no r2-term. the observation that type
i - heterotic duality dictates the appearance of an r2-contribution from the
disc diagram in type i theory was originally made in [16].
for a constant dilaton, which is all that we are interested in, the dependence
of the action on the type i string coupling constant gi (dened in general
by gs = exp < s >, for s = h, i, i respectively) is thus

si  z d10xgi (

(3.6)

now we t-dualize this on a two-torus of volume vi to type i theory in eight
dimensions. since the eight-dimensional newton constant is invariant, we
have (modulo factors of 2 and 2)

vi /g2

i = vi /g2

i   1/vi g2

and therefore

and

gi  gi /vi

thus the t-dualized eight-dimensional action is

since t-duality takes d9-branes to d7-branes and o9-planes to o7-planes,
one sees that in type i the r2- and f 2-terms come from discs attached to
the d7-branes and crosscaps corresopnding to o7-planes. this explains why
there is no transverse volume factor vi  in these terms.
now, to extract the n -dependence of these terms we scale the metric to unit
radius, not forgetting to scale vi  as well. thus

vi   l2vi

(3.12)
using (2.1) we see that, as anticipated, the string coupling constant drops
out and the einstein term is of order n 2 while the curvature squared terms
in the eective 7-brane action are of order n . for a recent discussion of
curvature squared terms in type ii d-brane actions see [17].
the precise numerical factors of the ve-dimensional action can now also be
determined. for the einstein term, plus the cosmological constant, we have
the inverse ten-dimensional newton constant times the volume vol(x 5) =
vol(s5)/2 times, as we have seen, l8, giving

d5xg(r  2)

(3.13)

where r now denotes the ve-dimensional ricci scalar.
for the riemann tensor squared term in ve dimensions, and related terms
arising from the dimensional reduction of the internal and mixed components
of this term, the numerical coecient arises as follows. there is a factor of
1/4 in the ten-dimensional action. it was related by supersymmetry to the
anomaly cancelling green-schwarz term for the gauge group so(32). by
turning on appropriate wilson lines in the type i theory, this gauge group
can be reduced to so(8)4. upon t-duality, these wilson lines translate into
the positions of the d7-branes in the type i theory.

9

thus there are clusters of 8 d7-branes, each of the clusters located at one of
the 4 o7 orientifold planes. as we have seen above, the total r2-term comes
from discs attached to d7-branes and crosscaps for the o7-planes, each of
the four clusters giving 1
4 of the total contribution. as in the near horizon
limit three of these clusters are innitely far away, only one quarter of this
term will be relevant.
moreover, because of the presence of the orientifold, the volume of the two-
torus should be taken to be (22) rather than the usual (2)2. wrapping
the d7 branes on the s3, the xed locus of the z2 action, produces another
contribution vol(s3). this s3 has [11, 9] the standard volume 22. finally,
there is, as we have seen above, a factor of l4 from the scaling of the metric
cancelling the 1/gi  .
putting everything together, we nd that the coecient of the r2-term
(as well as that of the other components of this term and other related
4-derivative terms in the action) is

sr2 =

(3.14)

note the striking similarity of this coecient with the subleading contribu-
tion (2.14) to the trace anomaly. even though we havent even begun to
calculate the contribution of this term to the trace anomaly, this certainly
suggests that we are on the right track.
the same argument shows that the tr f 2-term for the so(8)  so(8)4 
so(32) gauge elds in the heterotic action, reinstating the factor of 4 we
divided by before, gives rise to an order n contribution

sf 2 =

(3.15)

to the bulk action. alternatively [9], up to an overall normalization, the
coecient of this term could have been deduced from the so(8) dirac-
born-infeld action of the d7-branes. from this point of view it is of course
obvious that this is an open string disc contribution and hence of order n .
the relative factor of 4 between the gravitational and gauge eld couplings
mirrors that found in [9] for the ve-dimensional chern-simons terms arising
from the d7/o7 rr chern-simons couplings.
note again the striking similarity of this term with the contribution (2.18) of
external so(8) gauge elds to the trace anomaly. once we have developed

10

the appropriate machinery below, it will be straightforward to verify that
(3.15) reproduces exactly the anomaly (2.18).

4 review of the o(n 2) calculation

the strategy

before embarking on the calculation of the o(n ) contribution to the trace
anomaly, let us quickly review the calculation of the leading o(n 2) contri-
bution [6].
because the ads metric has a second order pole at innity, ads space only
induces a conformal equivalence class [g(0)
ij ] of metrics on the boundary. to
check for conformal invariance, one chooses a representative g(0)
ij acting as a
source term for the energy-momentum tensor of the boundary theory. the
ads/cft correspondence predicts that the cft eective action in the large
n supergravity limit is

wcf t (g0) = sgrav(g; g0) ,

(4.1)

where sgrav(g; g0) denotes the gravitational action evaluated on a classical
conguration which approaches (in the conformal sense) the metric g(0)
ij on
the boundary. the action is the sum of two terms, the standard bulk action

se  r (r  2), and a boundary term, involving the trace of the extrinsic

curvature of the boundary, required to ensure the absence of boundary terms
in the variational principle. to solve the classical equation of motion

r  1

2 g (r  2) = 0 ,

(4.2)

with this boundary condition, one can [18, 6] make the following ansatz for
the metric,

g dxdx =

l2
4

d2
2 +

1


gijdxidxj

,

(4.3)

with the boundary sitting at  = 0. we will set l = 1 in the following as
our scaling arguments use the unit radius metric. the metric gij has an
expansion as [18, 6]

gij = g(0)

ij + g(2)

ij + 2g(4)

ij + 2 log h(4)

ij + . . .

,

(4.4)

with g(0)

ij , as above, the chosen boundary value.

11

cf t (g(0)) is invariant under g(0) = g(0),  = .

now, for a solution to the classical equations of motion, both the bulk and
the boundary term are divergent (the former because for an einstein man-
ifold the classical einstein-hilbert action reduces to a volume integral, and
the latter because the induced metric on the boundary is singular). there-
fore, one needs to regularize this expression (which, in view of its conjectured
relation to the cft eective action is not surprising). this can be done by
introducing a cuto  restricting the range of  to   . note that, in
agreement with general arguments on holography [19], this bulk ir cuto
corresponds to an uv cuto in the cft. then the regularized cft eective
action w 
cf t (g(0)) can be written as a sum of terms diverging as   0, w cf t (g(0)),
w 
and a nite term w f in
cf t (g(0)). the former is a sum of terms which are in-
tegrals of local covariant expressions in the boundary metric g(0) and hence
they can be removed by local counterterms. among these terms there is, for
adsd+1 with d even, a logarithmically divergent term (which, interestingly
enough, does not arise from the logarithmic term in the expansion (4.4) of
the metric). in the standard way, removal of this term will then induce a
conformal anomaly in the nite part w f in(g(0)). the boundary term never
contributes to the conformal anomaly (this is a consequence of the fact that
the logarithmic term h(4)
in (4.4) is known to be traceless with respect to
ij
g(0) [18]) and we will not consider it in the following.

calculation of the o(n 2) contribution

in the case at hand, the precise form of the anomaly is determined as fol-

as one obtains a 3 from g, it is clear that a logarithmically divergent
term will arise only from the term of order 2 in (4.6). in particular, we
see that for any gravitational action including only the einstein term and
a cosmological constant, the leading contribution to the conformal anomaly
will be proportional to (4.12). comparing with the discussion in section
2, we see that this impies a = c to order n 2 as (4.12) does not contain a
riem2-term.
let us now apply this to ads5  x 5 and thus to the leading contribution
to the trace anomaly of the n = 2 superconformal eld theory considered
in [9] and above. using (3.13), and noting that the factor of 1/2 in (4.5)
is cancelled by a conventional factor of 2 in the denition of the conformal
anomaly, one nds that the o(n 2) conformal anomaly, i.e. the coecient of
the log -term, is

this is indeed precisely the leading contribution (2.13) to the conformal
anomaly calculated on the cft side.

5 the o(n) contribution

the strategy

now the strategy for including the riemann tensor sqared term should be
clear. we take the einstein plus riemann squared action (3.13) plus (3.14)
(possibly also with the f 2-term (3.15) - we will comment on the inclusion
of this term below)

s =

n 2

42 z d5xg(r  2) +

6n

24  162 z d5xgrr + . . . (5.1)

(plus boundary terms), solve the equations of motion with the given bound-
ary metric g(0), and isolate the log-divergent terms in the action evaluated
on this classical solution. note that, because of the presence of the term
rr in (5.1) this calculation will no longer reduce to just a volume
calculation.
in principle, of course, solving the classical equations of motion of this
higher-derivative gravity action to the required order in  is an unpleas-
ant task. in the present case, however, a drastic simplication is brought
about by the fact that we are only interested in the contributions of or-
der n to the classical action. for this, it is sucient to evaluate the term
rr on the classical solution of the previous section to the original
einstein equation (4.2).
indeed, as the second term in (5.1) is 1/n down with respect to the einstein
term, we can make an ansatz for the solution to the full equations in the
form

g = g(0)

 +

g(1)

 ,

(5.2)

1
n

where g(0)
 is a solution of (4.2). plugging this solution into the einstein
term, i.e. the rst term of (5.1), one obtains at order n 2 the leading contri-
bution to the anomaly calculated in the previous section. a term of order n
that could potentially arise as the next term in the expansion is actually zero
(because we are expanding about a classical solution to the einstein action
and the boundary term is precisely there to cancel any residual boundary
terms). the second term in (5.1) will give a contribution of order n when

14

 , and any other contributions involving g(1)

evaluated on g(0)
1 or lower.
therefore, to nd the order n contributions to the trace anomaly, we need
to

 will be of order

1. calculate the riemann curvature tensor of the metric (4.3), with gij

given by (4.4) and (4.8), as a function of , and

2. then determine the order 1-terms in the -expansion of

det ggg ggrr .

(5.3)

since we know that det g  3det g (4.5), this means that we need to

pick up the order 2-terms from

pdet gggggrr ,

(5.4)
here the -expansions of the curvature, of det g and of the inverse metric
have to be considered.2
if one also includes the f 2-term (3.15), then in principle one would of corse
have to solve the coupled einstein-yang-mills equations. but as the f 2-term
is also of order n the same argument as above shows that the resulting
subleading corrections to the metric are again irrelevant. as regards the
equation of motion for f itself, we will see below that only the boundary
value of f contributes so we do not have to solve these equations either.

external gauge fields

let us begin with the external gauge eld contribution (2.18) to the anomaly
as it is by far the simplest contribution to determine (much simpler, in fact,
than even the leading o(n 2) contribution to the anomaly discussed above).
as the above discussion shows, we need to pick up the order 2-terms of

pdet gggf a

f a

 .

(5.5)

now the components of the inverse metric are g = 42, gij = gij, where
gij has the expansion

gij = g(0)ij  g(2)ij + 2(((g(2))2)ij  g(4)ij ) + . . . ,

(5.6)

2similar calculations have recently also been performed in [20], however with the dia-
metrically opposite motivation of trying to reproduce the leading o(n 2) contribution to
the anomaly from a higher derivative action . . . . . . .

15

where indices are raised with g(0)ij . as the two inverse metrics contribute
at least a factor of  each, the only contribution to the anomaly arises from

qdet g(0)g(0)ikg(0)jlf (0)a

ij f (0)a

kl

,

(5.7)

where f (0)
ij

is the boundary value of the gauge eld

fij = f (0)

ij + o() .

(5.8)

in [9] the relation betwwen the bulk supergravity and boundary scft
so(8)-generators,
in the fundamental representation 8, was determined
from the ads/cft correspondence. using this result, one obtains that
t (8), appearing in the eld theoretic expression (2.18), is equal to 1. there-
fore, (3.15) gives precisely the external gauge eld contribution (2.18) to the
trace anomaly.
alternatively, this term could have been deduced (in the abelian, non-
interacting case) by following the prescription in [3]: on-shell, the bulk
maxwell action reduces to a boundary term, and this boundary term can
be evaluated in terms of wittens bulk-to-boundary greens functions, ex-
tracting the local term (relevant to the anomaly) in the end.
more directly, one can proceed locally, i.e. without using greens functions,
by solving the maxwell equations in a -expansion as was done for the ein-
stein equations in [6]. from this vantage point, the logarithmic divergence

arises directly in the boundary term  r aiai because a term of order
 log  in the -expansion of ai turns out to be required to solve the bulk
maxwell equations (cf. the 2 log -term in the expansion (4.4) of the metric,
required for the same reason).

the curvature tensor

as three dierent metrics appear here, g , gij and g(0)
ij , we will correspond-
ingly denote their curvature tensors by r
jkl.  will denote
the covariant derivative compatible with gij, (0) that compatible with g(0)
ij .
-derivatives will be denoted by a prime.
the ubiquitous combination gij  gij, which we will abbreviate to kij in
the following, contains no terms linear in . up to 2 log -terms one has

jkl, r(0)i

kij  gij  gij = g(0)

ij  2(g(4) + h(4)) + . . .

(5.9)

we will sometimes also abbreviate g(4) + h(4) = f (4).

as mentioned above, we need to pick up the order 2-terms from

pdet gggggrr ,

(5.15)

17

let us deal with rijk rst. in that case, the factor entering the contractions
is

pdet gggimgjngkp .

(5.16)
this will contribute at least 2  3 = 5, but the highest negative power
of  that can arise from the square of rijk is 2, giving an overall 3 and
therefore no contribution to the anomaly.
for rijkl we have

pdet ggimgjngkpglq .

(5.17)

this contributes 4 and higher powers. but the highest negative power
arising from r2
ijkl is 4. hence here terms of order 4, 5 and 6 in the
expansion of the contraction/volume factor (5.17) are relevant. at order n,
n = 4, 5, 6 respectively, one has:

contributions from rijkl

let us call the ve contributions in (5.12) i, ii, iii, iv and v . three
terms contribute to the 4-term of (5.18), namely ii  ii, i  iii and
i  v . i  iv only contributes a total derivative of a covariant quantity and
can therefore be cancelled by the variation of a local counterterm. using
the tracelessness of h(4) one sees that h(4) will not contribute either. the
other terms give

paired with i  ii:

(5.22)
the terms of order 6 in (5.18) need to be paired with i  i. from the rst

(5.30)

we see that the rst term reproduces precisely the subleading contribution
(2.14) to the conformal anomaly, in particular with the crucial term pro-
portional to (a  c). the second (error) term, on the other hand, is exactly
(and this is an important check on our calculation) of the form of a volume
contribution (4.12), just like the leading o(n 2)-term. we will say more
about the possible origin of this volume term below.

20

6 o(n) corrections for so and sp n = 4 theories
in this section we will briey discuss another class of models which, at rst
sight, seems to present a puzzle. looking back at the n = 4, su (n ) trace
anomaly (2.7), we see that there is a tree-level contribution, determined in
[6], no term of order n but an o(1) correction that ought to arise from a
string one-loop calculation. for other gauge groups g, however, the situation
is dierent. in general, one has

ht 

i =

dim(g)
322 [ric2  1

3 r2] .

(6.1)

in particular, for orthogonal (symplectic) gauge groups so(n ) (sp(n/2)
for n even), dim(g) contains both quadratic and linear terms in n ,

dim(so(2k)) = k(2k  1)
dim(so(2k + 1)) = dim(sp(k)) = k(2k + 1) ,

(6.2)

and we want to understand the origin of these linear terms in the ads/cft
correspondence.
n = 4 theories with gauge groups so(n ), sp(n/2) can be realized as the
low-energy dynamics of n parallel d3-branes at an orientifold o3-plane [21],
i.e. with the branes sitting at the singularity of a transverse r6/z2. here z2
acts as ~x  ~x for ~x  r6. note that, because of the non-compactness of
the transverse space, the number of d3-branes is not xed by rr tadpole
cancellation.
this strongly suggests [22] that a string theory dual to these theories is given
by type iib string theory on an ads5  rp5 orientifold.
clearly, unlike for the n = 2 theory we discussed above, now there are
no branes wrapping the entire ads5. so where are the terms linear in n
going to come from? the answer is: from the classical einstein action itself.
the reason for this is that op-planes themeselves are carriers of rr-charge,
and hence the numerical value of n appearing in the classical dp-brane
solutions (in the coecient of the term rp7 in the corresponding harmonic
function, r being the transverse distance from the brane), will be shifted
in the presence of an orientifold op-plane. in particular, o3-planes carry
fractional rr charge  1
4 [21, 23]. with the minus sign, one obtains so(n ),
and with the plus sign, for n even, sp(n/2) gauge theories.
in fact, at
least prior to taking the near-horizon limit, in the coecient of the leading

21


r )7p) correction to the classical dp-brane solution, this n -
order o((
independent term arises from the addition of the crosscap rp2 orientifold
contribution (of order gs) to the disc d-brane diagram (of order gsn ).
this should extend to all orders to reproduce the expected result so that, in
the ads-limit, the net-eect of the presence of the o3-plane is to replace n
as appearing in (2.1) by

n

(6.5)

comparing with (6.2), we see that to order n this agrees exactly with the
trace anomaly formula (6.1) for g = so(n ) and g = sp(n/2). in these
cases we have therefore been able to reproduce both the leading and the
subleading order n corrections directly from the classical einstein action by
taking into account the fractional rr charge of the o3-plane.

7 discussion

we have shown that supergravity calculations with higher-derivative actions
are capable of reproducing the subleading corrections to the cft trace
anomaly. in this particular example, on the basis of the results of [9] this
was to be expected on general grounds since supersymmetry relates the
chiral and trace anomalies. nevertheless, we nd it quite remarkable that
the somewhat messy (even though straightforward) classical calculations
performed above conspire to give precisely the correct result for the trace
anomaly in the end.

22

as regards the missing volume contribution, we have of course attempted to
determine this in a variety of ways but it seems to us that a denitive answer
requires a better understanding of -corrections and supersymmetrization
of the type i eective action.
as the expansion (4.6) produces 1/8 times (4.12), we see that what we are
missing is an eective cosmological constant term
gd5x .

(7.1)



168  6n
24  162 zads5

there are many possible terms that can contribute to this cosmological
constant. for instance, we have so far neglected the contributions of the
internal and mixed components of rlm n p rlm n p . these contributions
can in principle be determined either from duality arguments or by a direct
two-point function calculation on the type i side. there may also be four-
derivative terms of the metric involving the squares of the ricci tensor or
ricci scalar (perhaps in the form of the familiar gauss-bonnet combination).
such terms are aicted by the usual eld redenition ambiguities. finally,
there may also be terms involving (f (5))4 and mixed terms of the type
r(f (5))2. the former correspond to four-point functions on the type i side
and a direct calculation of these terms, although possible in principle, is
somewhat cumbersome.
one might have hoped to be able to invoke heterotic - type i - type i duality
once more to x these terms. for instance, in the heterotic string it is known
[13] that supersymmetry forces the cp-even four-derivative terms involving
gm n and bm n to appear as curvature-squared terms of the connection with
torsion h = db + . . .. as h eventually dualizes to f (5) in the type i theory,
this is the sort of restrictive structure one might have hoped for. however,
chasing these terms through the dualities is somewhat problematic.
for one, as one is taking a large volume limit on the type i side, this cor-
responds to a small two-torus on the type i side, and thus it appears that
winding mode contributions in type i need also be considered. also, at
a purely classical level, in order to t-dualize the d7/o7/d3 conguration
underlying the n = 2 theory we have been considering to a type i conigura-
tion of d9/d5 branes one needs to delocalize it in the transverse directions.
but if one does that, it will no longer have the same near-horizon limit (t-
duality and near-horizon limits do not commute). conversely, we have been
unable to nd a classical type i solution which gives the desired congura-
tion on the type i side and which could have been used to calculate the
eective cosmological constant directly on the type i side.

23

all this just conrms the general picture that appears to be emerging from
the work done on the ads/cft correspondence, namely that whatever can
be checked reliably conrms the conjectured correspondence, but that even
simple (one-loop, anomaly) eld theory calculations are dicult to repro-
duce on the ads side. clearly, what is required among other things is a
better understanding of string theory with rr backgrounds.
