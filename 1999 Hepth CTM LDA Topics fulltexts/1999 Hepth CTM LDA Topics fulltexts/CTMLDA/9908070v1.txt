bousso has conjectured that in any spacetime satisfying einsteins equation and satisfying the dominant energy
condition, the entropy ux s through any null hypersurface l generated by geodesics with non-positive expan-
sion starting from some spacelike 2 surface of area a must satisfy s  a/4gh. this conjecture reformulates
earlier conjectured entropy bounds of bekenstein and also of fischler and susskind, and can be interpreted as a
statement of the so-called holographic principle. we extend boussos entropy bound to a stronger bound which
directly implies the generalized second law of thermodynamics. we show that our stronger entropy bound can
be derived from either of two sets of hypotheses. the rst set of hypotheses is (i) associated with each null sur-
face l in spacetime there is an entropy ux 4-vector sa
l whose integral over l is the entropy ux through l, and
(ii) along each null geodesic generator of l, we have |sa
lka|  (  )tabkakb/h, where tab is the stress-
energy tensor,  is an afne parameter, ka = (d/d)a, and  is the value of afne parameter at the endpoint
of the geodesic. the second (purely local) set of hypotheses is (i) there exists an absolute entropy ux 4-vector
sa such that the entropy ux through any null surface l is the integral of sa over l, and (ii) this entropy ux
4-vector obeys the pointwise inequalities (saka)2  tabkakb/(16h2g) and |kakbasb|  tabkakb/(4h)
for any null vector ka.

i. introduction and summary

a. background and motivation

in recent years, a number of independent universal entropy
bounds have been postulated to hold for arbitrary systems.
the rst such bound was conjectured by bekenstein, who pro-
posed that the entropy s and energy e of any matter put into
a box must obey [1]

s/e  2r,

(1.1)

where r denotes some suitable measure of the size of the box.
[throughout this paper, we use units with g = c = h =
k = 1.] the original motivation for the bound (1.1) was the
belief that it is necessary for the validity of the generalized
second law of thermodynamics (gsl), which states that in all
physical processes, the generalized entropy

s = s + sbh

(1.2)

must always increase, where s is the entropy of matter out-
side of black holes, sbh = ah /4, and ah denotes the total
surface area of all black hole horizons. subsequently it was
shown that the bound (1.1) is not necessary for the validity of
the generalized second law [24]. in addition, the bound is vi-
olated by thermal states of free quantum elds at low temper-
atures in boxes with dirichlet boundary conditions, and fails

when the number of species of particles is sufciently large.
finally, it is far from clear what the precise meaning of r in
the conjecture is supposed to be, particularly in curved space-
time. nevertheless, a case can be made that the bound (1.1)
may hold for all physically realistic systems found in nature,
at least at temperatures t with t >
 1/r; see ref. [5] for
further discussion.
more recently, an alternative entropy bound has been con-
sidered: the entropy s inside any region whose boundary has
area a must satisfy [6]

s  a/4.

(1.3)

an argument given in ref. [7] suggests that the bound (1.3)
should follow from the gsl together with the assumption that
the entropy of a black hole counts the number of possible in-
ternal states of the black hole. in addition, when e <
 r,
this bound would follow from the original bekenstein bound

the argument is attributed to bekenstein in ref. [7] and goes as
follows. if black hole entropy counts the number of internal states
of a black hole, then any system having s  a/4 is not a black
hole. then, one would expect to be able to make that system into a
black hole with area a by collapsing a sufciently massive spherical
shell of matter around it. in this process, it appears that no entropy

(1.1). the inequality (1.3) does not fail at low temperatures,
unlike the bound (1.1), but, like the bound (1.1), it can be vi-
olated if the number of massless particle species is allowed
to be arbitrarily large. the inequality (1.3) is related to the
hypothesis known as the holographic principle, which states
that the physics in any spatial region can be fully described in
terms of degrees of freedom living on the boundary of that re-
gion, with one degree of freedom per planck area [9,7]. if the
holographic principle is correct, then since the entropy in any
region should be bounded above by the number of fundamen-
tal degrees of freedom in that region, a bound of the form (1.3)
should be valid for all systems, including those with strong
self-gravity.

as it stands, the bound (1.3) is ambiguous, since the pre-
cise meaning of the bounding area, a, has not been spelled
out. in particular, note that any world tube can always be en-
closed by a two-surface of arbitrarily small area, since given
any two-surface in spacetime, there exists a two-surface of ar-
bitrarily small area arbitrarily close to the original two-surface
(obtained by wiggling the original two-surface suitably in
spacetime). however, very recently, a specic conjecture of
the form (1.3) was suggested by bousso [10,11], who im-
proved an earlier suggestion of fischler and susskind [12,13].
bousso showed that several example spacetimes, including
cosmological models and gravitational collapse spacetimes,
are consistent with his conjecture.

boussos conjecture is as follows. let (m, gab) be a space-
time satisfying einsteins equation and also the dominant en-
ergy condition [14]. let b be a connected 2 dimensional
spacelike surface in m . suppose that ka is a smooth null vec-
tor eld on b which is everywhere orthogonal to b. then the
expansion

 = aka

(1.4)

of ka is well dened and is independent of how ka is extended
off b. suppose that   0 everywhere on b. let l denote the
null hypersurface generated by the null geodesics starting at b
with initial tangent ka, where each null geodesic is terminated
if and only if a caustic is reached (where   ), and
otherwise is extended as far as possible. then the entropy
ux, sl, through l satises

escapes, but this means that we convert an s  a/4 system into
a black hole of area a, violating the generalized second law. an
antecedent to this argument can be found in ref. [8].
 for example, consider n free massless scalar elds in at space-
time, in a cube of edge length l with dirichlet boundary conditions.
the thermal state with temperature t with t  1/l has energy e
which scales as e  n exp[/(lt )]/l, and entropy s which
scales like s  n exp[/(lt )]/(lt ). for the system to be
weakly self-gravitating (a necessary condition for the at-spacetime
analysis to be a good approximation) we must have e = l for
some   1. using this restriction to solve for the maximum al-
lowed value of n yields s/l2  /(lt ), which can be arbitrarily
large.

sl  ab/4,

(1.5)

where ab is the area of b.

there is a close relationship between boussos conjec-
ture and the generalized second law. consider a foliation of
the horizon of a black hole by spacelike two-surfaces b(),
where  is a continuous label that increases in the future di-
rection. let a() be the area of the two surface b(), and let
s() be the total entropy that crosses the horizon before the
2-surface b(). then if one assumes the ordinary second law,
the gsl is equivalent to the statement that for any 1 < 2
we have

s(2)  s(1) 

1
4

[a(2)  a(1)] .

(1.6)

on the other hand, boussos entropy bound applied to the 2-
surface b()with ka taken to be the past directed normal
to the horizon, so that we have   0 on b() when the null
energy condition is satiseddemands merely that

s() 

1
4

a()

(1.7)

for all . thus, boussos bound implies that the gsl holds for
the case when the initial time, 1, is taken to be the time when
the black hole is rst formed [so that s(1) = a(1) = 0]. in
general, however, it is clear that the statement (1.7) is weaker
than the statement (1.6).

this observation motivates a generalization of boussos
conjecture. namely, if one allows the geodesics generating
the hypersurface l to terminate at some spacelike 2-surface
b before coming to a caustic or singularity, one can replace
the conjectured inequality (1.5) by the condition

sl

4

[ab  ab  ] .

(1.8)

in this paper we shall prove the more general entropy bound
(1.8) under certain assumptions concerning the local entropy
content of matter. it is clear from the above discussion that this
more general bound implies both the original bousso entropy
bound and the gsl (assuming of course the validity of the
ordinary second law). we note that proofs of the gsl that
are more general than the proof of this paper have previously
been given [15]; however the previous proofs used specic
properties of black-hole spacetimes, unlike our analysis.

b. derivations of entropy bound and of generalized second law:

framework, viewpoint and assumptions

the starting point for our derivation of the generalized en-
tropy bound (1.8) is a postulated phenomenological descrip-
tion of entropy, which differs from assumptions that have been
used in the past to derive the gsl [15]. in this section we
describe our phenomenological description of entropy and its
motivation.

first, note that one of the hypotheses of boussos conjec-
ture is the dominant energy condition, which is often violated

2

by the expected stress energy tensor of matter in semiclassi-
cal gravity. hence the conjecture cannot have the status of a
fundamental law as it is currently stated, but rather can only
be relevant in classical regimes where the dominant energy
condition is satised [16]. it may be possible to replace the
dominant energy condition by a quantum inequality of the
type invented by ford and roman [1721] to overcome this
difculty. in this paper we will assume the null convergence
condition, that tabkakb  0 for all null vectors ka [see eqs.
(1.9) and (1.10)(1.11) below], which is weaker than the dom-
inant energy condition. thus, our proof of boussos conjec-
ture, like the conjecture itself, is limited to classical regimes
in which local energy conditions are satised.

clearly, in order to derive the bound (1.8), we must make
some assumptions about entropy. the entropy that the con-
jecture refers to presumably should include gravitational con-
tributions. it seems plausible that any gravitational entropy
ux through the null hypersurface l will be associated with a
shearing of that hypersurface, which has the same qualitative
effect in the raychaudhuri equation [see eq. (2.12) below] as
a matter stress-energy ux. thus, it may be possible to treat
gravitational contributions to entropy in a manner similar to
the matter contributions. however, our present understanding
of quantum gravity is not sufcient to attempt to meaning-
fully quantify the gravitational contributions to entropy. con-
sequently, in our analysis below, we shall consider only the
matter contributions to entropy.

with regard to the matter contribution to entropy, for both
the gsl and the bousso bound, there is an apparent tension
between the fact that these statements are supposed to have the
status of fundamental laws and the fact that entropy is a quan-
tity whose denition is coarse-graining dependent. however,
this tension is resolved by noting that the number of degrees
of freedom should be an upper bound for the entropy s, irre-
spective of choice of coarse-graining [11]. equivalently, we
may restrict attention to the case where the matter is locally
in thermal equilibrium (i.e., maximum entropy density for its
given energy density); if the bound holds in this case, it must
hold in all cases.

we shall proceed by assuming that a phenomenological de-
scription of matter entropy can be given in terms of an entropy
ux 4-vector sa. we shall then postulate some properties of
sa.
in fact, we shall postulate two independent sets of hy-
potheses on sa, each of which will be sufcient to prove the

lowe [16] argues that the bousso conjecture must fail for a sys-
tem consisting of an evaporating black hole accreting at just the right
rate to balance the hawking radiation mass loss. for such a system,
it would seem that the black hole can accrete an arbitrary amount of
entropy without changing its area, and in addition it is hard to see
how a modied bousso conjecture incorporating a quantum inequal-
ity rather than a local energy condition could be satised. however,
this counterexample might be resolved by the fact that it may be ap-
propriate to assign a negative entropy ux at the horizon to states
with an outgoing hawking ux, or it might be resolved by making
adjustments to the bousso conjecture.

bound (1.8). note that, at a fundamental level, entropy is a
non-local quantity and so can be well described by a entropy
ux 4-vector only in certain regimes and over certain scales.
this fact is reected in our hypotheses below.

the rst of our two sets of hypotheses is very much in the
spirit of the original bekenstein bound (1.1). suppose that one
has a null hypersurface, l, the generators of which terminate
at a nite value  of afne parameter . suppose that one
puts matter in a box and drops it through l in such a way that
the back end of the box crosses l at . then, if a bound
of the nature of (1.1) holds, the amount of entropy crossing
l should be limited by the energy within the box and the box
size. the box size, in turn, would be related to the afne
parameter at which the front end of the box crossed l. on the
other hand, suppose that matter owing through l near 
were not conned by a box. then there would be no box size
restriction on the entropy ux near . however, in order to
have a larger entropy ux than one could achieve when using
a box, it clearly would be necessary to put the matter in a state
where the modes carrying the entropy spill over beyond
. in that case, it is far from clear that the entropy carried
by these modes should be credited as arriving prior to , so
that they would count in the entropy ux through l. in other
words, it seems reasonable to postulate that the entropy ux
through l cannot be higher than the case where the matter
is placed in a box whose back end crosses l at , and to
consider a bound on this entropy ux of the general form of
eq. (1.1).

the above considerations motivate the following hypothe-
sis concerning the entropy ux. we assume that associated
with every null surface l, there is an entropy ux 4-vector sa
l
from which one can compute the entropy ux through l. let
 be a null geodesic generator of l, with afne parameter 
and tangent ka = (d/d)a. if  is of innite afne parameter
length, then tabkakb = 0 along  by the focusing theorem
[14], and we assume that sa
l = 0 along . on the other hand,
if  ends at a nite value, , of afne parameter, then we
assume that

|sa
lka|  (  )tabkakb.

(1.9)

the inequality (1.9) is a direct analog of the original beken-
lka| playing the role of s, tabkakb
stein bound (1.1), with |sa
playing the role of e, and    playing the role of r. as
discussed above, the motivation for the bound (1.9) is essen-
tially the same as that for the bound (1.1). note that eq. (1.9)
is independent of choice of afne parameterization of , i.e.,

from eq. (2.12), our proof also works if we replace the hypothesis
(1.9) with the weaker hypotheses that

|sa

lka|  (  )(cid:2)tabkakb + ab ab/8(cid:3) ,

where ab is the shear tensor [eq. (9.2.28) of ref. [14]] associated
with the generators of l. in this context, we can interpret sa
l to be
the combined matter and gravitational entropy ux, rather than just
the matter entropy ux.

both sides of this equation scale the same way under a change
of afne parameter.

the above set of hypotheses has the property that the en-
lka, depends upon l in the sense (described
tropy ux, sa
above) that modes that only partially pass through l prior to
 do not contribute to the entropy ux. in our second set of
hypotheses, we assume the existence of an absolute entropy
ux 4-vector sa, which is independent of the choice of l. we
assume that this sa obeys the following purely local, point-
wise inequalities for any null vector ka
(saka)2  1 tabkakb

(1.10)

and

|kakbasb|  2 tabkakb,

(1.11)

where tab is the stress-energy tensor . here 1 and 2 can
be any positive constants that satisfy

(1)1/4 + (2/)1/2 = 1.

(1.12)

[recall that we are using planck units with g = c = h =
k = 1.] a specic simple choice of 1 and 2 that satisfy
the condition (1.12) is 1 = 1/(16) and 2 = /4, which
are the values quoted in the abstract above. note that, like eq.
(1.9), eqs. (1.10) and (1.11) are independent of the choice of
scaling of ka. also note that both of our sets of hypotheses
(1.9) and (1.10)(1.11) imply the null convergence condition
tabkakb  0, as mentioned above.

the stress energy tensor appearing in these inequalities should
be interpreted as a macroscopic or averaged stress energy tensor tab,
rather than a microscopic stress energy tensor tab. for example,
for an atomic gas, the fundamental microscopic stress-energy tensor
tab will vary rapidly over atomic and nuclear scales, while a suit-
able averaged macroscopic stress tensor tab can be taken to vary
only over macroscopic scales (like the conventional entropy current
sa). thus our results apply to null surfaces l of an averaged, macro-
scopic metric gab rather than the physical metric gab [22]. note that
null surfaces of gab can differ signicantly from the null surfaces
of gab, since with suitable microscopic sources (for example cosmic
strings) a null surface of gab can be made to intersect itself very fre-
quently without the occurrence of caustics. however, the boundary
of the future (or past) of the 2-surface b with respect to gab should
be close to the boundary of the future (respectively, past) of b with
respect to gab. thus, if one wishes to work with the exact metric
gab, one should presumably replace the null hypersurface, l, in the
bousso conjecture and our generalization (1.8) with a suitable por-
tion of the boundary of the future (or past) of b. this new formula-
tion of the conjectures should hold whenever eq. (1.9) or eqs. (1.10)
and (1.11) hold for the macroscopically averaged entropy current and
macroscopically averaged stress energy tensor. an alternative inter-
pretative framework would be to assume the existence of an entropy
current which varies rapidly on the smallest scales that are compat-
ible with our gradient assumption (1.11) [atomic and nuclear scales
in our example], in which case our result would apply directly to the
microscopic metric.

we now turn to a discussion of the physical regimes in
which we expect the pointwise assumptions (1.10) and (1.11)
of our second set of hypotheses to be valid. the rst as-
sumption (1.10) of our second set of hypotheses says, roughly
speaking, that the entropy density is bounded above by the
square root of the energy density. one can check that the con-
dition is satised for thermal equilibrium states of bose and
fermi gases except at temperatures above a critical tempera-
ture of order the planck temperature. one can also check that
for quantum elds in a box at low temperatures (the example
discussed in sec. i a above), the condition (1.10) is violated
only if the box is planck size or smaller, or if the number of
species is allowed to be very large. thus, it seems plausible
that the bound (1.10) will be universally valid if one assumes a
planck scale cutoff for physics and if one also assumes a limit
to the number of species. the second assumption (1.11) states
roughly that the gradient of the entropy density is bounded
above by the energy density. for a free, massless boson or
fermion gas in local thermal equilibrium, this condition re-
duces to the condition that the temperature gradient, |t|, be
small compared with t 2, i.e., that the fractional change in t
over a distance 1/t be smaller than unity. this condition must
be satised in order for the notion of local thermal equilibrium
to make sense.

in addition, it would appear that condition (1.11) is nec-
essary for our entire phenomenological description of en-
tropy as represented by an 4-current sa to be valid. to see
this, consider the following illustrative example. consider a
wavepacket mode of a quantum eld, where the wavelength is
 and where the volume occupied by the wavepacket is f 3
for some dimensionless factor f >
 1. consider a state where
this wavepacket mode is occupied by n particles. such a sys-
tem has a well dened expected stress energy tensor h tabi,
whose corresponding energy density will be of order

n
f 4 .

 

(1.13)

we now imagine that we are to somehow model such a system
with a smooth entropy ux vector sa. we expect that the total
entropy carried by the system should be of order n , so that
the entropy density s should be approximately

n
f 3 .

s 

(1.14)

clearly the concept of local entropy ux here cannot make
sense on scales short compared to the wavelength ; only in
an averaged sense, on scales comparable to  or larger, does
the concept of entropy ux make sense. thus, the lengthscale
l = s/|s| over which the entropy density varies should be
greater than or of the order of . from the estimates (1.13) and
(1.14), the condition l >
 , which
is essentially our assumption (1.11). hence, our second con-
dition (1.11) rules out the class of entropy currents sa which
vary signicantly over scales shorter than , allowing only the
more appropriate sa that vary over scales of a wavelength or
longer.

  is equivalent to |s| <

4

in summary, we expect our second set of hypotheses to be
valid in regimes where the following conditions are satised:
(i) the gravitational contributions to entropy, other than that
from black holes, are negligible. (ii) the matter entropy can
be accurately be described by an entropy current sa. in par-
ticular, this condition will be valid in familiar hydrodynamic
regimes. (iii) the vacuum energy contributions to the stress-
energy tensor are negligible, so that the stress-energy tensor
satises classical energy conditions.

in regimes satisfying these three conditions, our hypotheses
(1.10) and (1.11) should be valid, and hence our arguments
show that the our generalization (1.8) of boussos entropy
bound should hold. while our arguments do not show that
the entropy bound (1.8) holds at any fundamental level, they
do show than any counterexample either must involve quan-
tum phenomena in an essential way, or must violate eq. (1.9)
and eq. (1.10) or eq. (1.11).

ii. derivation of generalized entropy bound

in this section we derive the generalized entropy bound
(1.8) from the each of the two sets of assumptions (1.9) and
(1.10)(1.11).

we start with some denitions and constructions. first, we
can without loss of generality take the vector eld ka on the 2-
surface b to be future directed, since the conjecture is time re-
versal invariant. let la be the unique vector eld on b which
is null, future directed, orthogonal to b and which satises
laka = 1. we extend both ka and la to l by parallel trans-
port along the null geodesic generators of l. thus, ka is tan-
gent to each geodesic. then the expansion  = aka is well
dened on l and independent of how ka is extended off of l,
since

 = (gab + kalb + kbla)akb.

(2.1)

by the hypotheses of boussos conjecture and of its general-
ization (1.8),  is nonpositive everywhere on l. let {x} =
(x1, x2) be any coordinate system on b. then one obtains a
natural coordinate system (, x1, x2) on l in the obvious way,
where ka = (d/d)a and we take  = 0 on b.

for the generator  which starts at the point x on b, let
(x) be the value of afne parameter (possibly  = )
at the endpoint of the generator. this endpoint can either be
a caustic ( = ) or have a nite expansion . we can
without loss of generality exclude the case  = , since
otherwise we must have tabkakb = 0 along  by the focus-
ing theorem, and then either version of our hypotheses imply
that sa = 0 along , so that there is no contribution to the en-
tropy ux. thus, generators of innite afne parameter length
make no contribution to the lhs of the inequality (1.8) while
making a non-negative contribution to the rhs, and so can be
ignored. for the generators of nite afne parameter length,
we can without loss of generality rescale the afne parameter
along each generator in order to make the endpoint occur at
 = 1.

5

a. reducing the conjecture to each null geodesic generator

next, we show that it is sufcient to focus attention on each
individual generator of l, one at a time. more specically we
have the following lemma.
lemma: a sufcient condition for the generalized entropy
bound (1.8) is that for each null geodesic generator  of l of
nite afne parameter length, we have

z 1

0

where

d (saka)a()

a()  exp"z

(2.2)

(2.3)

is an area-decrease factor associated with the given genera-
tor.

to prove the lemma, rst note that by assumption the en-

tropy ux through l is given by

sl =zl

saabcd,

(2.4)

where the orientation on the hypersurface l is that determined
by the 3-form

bcd  laabcd.

(2.5)

here we are using the notation of appendix b of ref. [14] for
integrals of differential forms, and we also use the abstract in-
dex notation of ref. [14] for all roman indices throughout the
paper. the formula (2.4) applies for either version of our phe-
nomenological description of entropy, i.e., we can use either
sa or sa
l in the integrand. in appendix a we derive the fol-
lowing formula for the integral (2.4) in the coordinate system
(, x):

d2xpdet h(x) z (x)

sl =zb
here x  (x1, x2) = x, h(x) is the induced 2-metric on
the 2-surface b, (x) is the value of afne parameter at the
endpoint of the generator which starts at x, and

d s()a().

(2.6)

s  saka.

(2.7)

note that s is non-negative for future directed, timelike or null
sa, which we expect to be the case. [however, our proof does
not require the assumptions that sa be timelike or null and
future directed.] now as discussed above, s() = 0 for those
generators of innite afne parameter length, so it follows that

sl =z 

b

d2xpdet h(x) z 1

b d2x denotes an integral only over those generators
of nite afne parameter length. now we see that if the con-
dition (2.2) is satised, then we obtain from eq. (2.8) that

sl

b

d2xpdet h(x) [1  a(1, x)] .

(2.9)

the generalized entropy bound (1.8) now follows from eq.
(2.9), using the fact that the area ab of the 2-surface b is
given by

now by assumption any geodesic generator must terminate
no later than the point (if it exists) at which a()  0. hence
we have a()  0 everywhere on l. it is convenient to dene
g() = pa(), from which it follows from the denition
(2.3) of the area-decrease factor and from the raychaudhuri
equation (2.12) that

(2.10)

f () = 2

(2.18)

ab =zb

d2xpdet h(x),

while the area ab  of the 2-surface b composed of the end-
points of the generators is

ab  =z

d2xpdet h(x)a(1, x).

(2.11)

b. preliminaries

from the lemma, its sufcient now to prove the condition
(2.2) for each nite-afne-parameter-length null generator 
of l. for ease of notation we henceforth drop the dependence
on the x coordinates in all quantities. now the twist along
each of the null generators will vanish, since it is vanishing
initially on the two surface b, and the evolution equation for
the twist [14] then implies that it always vanishes. the ray-
chaudhuri equation in the relevant case of vanishing twist can
thus be written as

sor. the function f is non-negative by the null convergence
condition [which follows from either eq. (1.9) or eqs. (1.10)
(1.11)] since ab ab  0 always. the assumption (1.9) of our
rst set of hypotheses now implies that

it follows that g is negative. also the expansion  is al-
ways negative, and hence g is always negative, so that g is
monotonically decreasing, starting at the value g(0) = 1, and
ending at some value g(1) with 0  g(1)  1. in particular,
we have 0  g()  1 for all . for those generators which
terminate at caustics we have g(1) = a(1) = 0, but not all
generators will terminate at caustics; some might terminate at
the auxiliary spacelike 2-surface b.

c. proof under rst set of hypotheses

using the formulae (2.13) and the denition g = a we

nd that the integral (2.17) satises

i 

1

8z 1

0

d (1  )f ()g()2.

(2.19)

from the formula (2.18) for f (), this can be written as

i  z 1

0

d (1  )g()g()/4.

(2.20)

now we have 0  g()  1, so we can drop the factor of
g() in the integrand of eq. (2.20). integrating by parts and
using the fundamental theorem of calculus now gives

|s()|  (1  )f ()/8.

(2.13)

similarly, our second set of hypotheses (1.10) and (1.11) im-
ply that

now

i 

1
4

[g(0)  g(1) + g(0)] .

(2.21)

(2.22)

s()2  1f ()

|s()|  2f (),

(2.14)

(2.15)

and

where

g(0)  g(1) = 1  g(1)  1  a(1),

since g(0) = 1 and g(1) = pa(1)  a(1). also the third

term in eq. (2.21) is negative. it follows that

i 

1
4

[1  a(1)] ,

(2.23)

1 = 81,

2 = 82.

(2.16)

as required.

our task now is to show that the quantity

i z 1

0

d s()a()

(2.17)

is smaller than [1  a(1)]/4, using only the denition (2.3)
of the area-decrease factor, the raychaudhuri equation (2.12),
and either eq. (2.13) or eqs. (2.14)  (2.15).

d. proof under second set of hypotheses

first, note that without loss of generality we can assume
that the function s() is nonnegative. this is because we can
replace s() by |s()| in the integral (2.17) without decreas-
ing the value of the integral, and the assumptions (2.14) and

6

(2.15) are satised by the function |s| if they are satised by
s, since ||s| |  |s|.
we start by xing a 1 in (0, 1), the value of which we will
pick later. we then choose a 0 in [0, 1] which minimizes f
in the interval [0, 1], i.e., we choose a 0 which satises

i =z 0

0

sa +z 1

0

sa = i1 + i2.

(2.30)

in the formula for i1, we drop the factor of a which is  1,
insert a factor of 1 = d/d, and integrate by parts to obtain

f (0) = min

01

f ().

(2.24)

[we assume that the function f () is continuous so that this
minimum is attained]. we now show that

i1  i1b + i 
1.

(2.31)

here i1b is the boundary term that is generated, given by

i1b = s(0)0,

(2.32)

f (0) 

2
22
1

[1  a(1)]2 .

and

(2.25)

to see this, let 0() and a0() be the expansion and area-
decrease factor that would be obtained by solving the ray-
chaudhuri equation (2.12) with f () replaced by f (0), and
using the same initial condition 0(0) = (0). since f () 
f (0) for 0    1, it is clear that we must have

i 

1 = z 0

0

d s().

(2.33)

similarly we insert a factor of 1 = d(  1)/d into the for-
mula for i2 and integrate by parts, which yields

i2 = i2b + i 
2,

(2.34)

(2.35)

a()  a0()

(2.26)

where the boundary term is

for 0    1. but the explicit solution of the raychaudhuri
equation for 0() and a0() is

and where

i2b = s(0)a(0)(1  0),

0() = p2f (0) tan"r f (0)

2

( + )#

(2.27)

and

a0() =

2

cos2(cid:20)q f (0)
cos2(cid:20)q f (0)

( + )(cid:21)
(cid:21)

2

,

(2.28)

where  is a constant in [0, 1]. applying the inequality (2.26)
at  = 1 now yields

a(1)  a0(1)  cos2"r f (0)

2

1# .

(2.29)

using the inequality cos1()  (1  2)/2 which is valid
for 0    1, and the inequality a(1)  a(1), one can
obtain the upper bound (2.25) from eq. (2.29).
next, we split the integral (2.17) into a contribution i1 from
the interval [0, 0] and a contribution i2 from the interval
[0, 1]:

the proof extends easily to the non-continuous case. if we choose
 > 0 and choose 0 so that

f (0) = (1 + ) g.l.b. {f ()| 0    1},

then we can come as close as we please to satisfying the inequality
(2.54). hence the inequality (2.54) is satised.

i 

2 =z 1

0

d [sa(1  ) + sa(1  )] .

(2.36)

an upper bound on the total integral is now given by the rela-
tion

i  i1b + i2b + i 

1 + i 
2.

(2.37)

we now proceed to derive bounds on the integrals i 
on the total boundary term i1b + i2b.

1, i 

2, and

consider rst the total boundary term, which from eqs.

(2.32) and (2.35) is given by

i1b + i2b = s(0) [0 + (1  0)a(0)] .

(2.38)
since a(0) and 0 both lie in [0, 1], this is bounded above
by s(0). if we now use our assumption (2.14) we nd

i1a + i1b p1 f (0),

and using the bound (2.25) on f (0) nally yields

i1a + i1b 

1
21
turn now to the integral i 
into the formula (2.33) for i 
f () yields

[1  a(1)] .

1. inserting the assumption (2.15)
1 and using the formula (2.18) for

(2.39)

(2.40)

i

g
g

 d.

(2.41)

since g is a decreasing function, we can replace the 1/g()
in the integrand by 1/g(0). if we then integrate by parts and
use the fundamental theorem of calculus we obtain

7

i 
1 

2 2
g(0)

[g(0)  1  g(0)0] .

since g(0)  1 this yields

i 
1  

2 2g(0)0

g(0)

.

we now show that for all  in [0, 1],

g()

(2.44)

(2.52)

choosing the value of 1 that minimizes this upper bound
yields

i

sr 1


2

.

(2.53)

using the denition (2.16) of the the parameters 1 and 2
together with the assumption (1.12) yields

i 

1
4

[1  a(1)] ,

(2.54)

to see this, apply the mean value theorem to the function g
over the interval [, 1], which yields

as required.

g(1)  g() = (1  )g(),

(2.45)

for some  in [, 1]. but since g is negative by eq. (2.18)
we have g()  g(), and it follows that

g()

(2.46)

here the last inequality follows from g =

now yields

(2.47)

formula (2.36) for i 

finally, we turn to the integral i 

2. the second term in the
1 is negative and so can be dropped. in the
rst term, we use the formula g = a, the formula (2.18) for

f () and our gradient assumption in the form (2.15) to obtain

i 

2  2 2z 1

0

d gg(1  ).

(2.48)

now since 0  g()  1 for all , we can drop the factor of
g() in the integrand. if we then integrate by parts and use
the fundamental theorem of calculus we obtain

i 
2  2 2 [g(0)  g(1) + (1  0)g(0)] .

now since g(0)  1 and g = 

a we have

g(0)  g(1)  1  g(1)  1  a(1).

(2.49)

(2.50)

also, the last term in eq. (2.49) is negative. hence we obtain
the upper bound

i 
2  2 2 [1  a(1)] .

(2.51)

finally we combine eq. (2.37) with the upper bounds
(2.40), (2.47), and (2.51) for the boundary term i1b + i2b and
for the integrals i 

2 to yield

1 and i 

iii. conclusion

we have shown that the generalization (1.8) of boussos
entropy bound is satised under two different sets of hypothe-
ses, (1.9) and (1.10)  (1.11), constraining the entropy ux.
while these hypotheses are unlikely to represent relations in
any fundamental theory, they appear to be satised for mat-
ter in a certain semi-classical regime below the planck scale.
as such, our results rule out a large class of possible coun-
terexamples to boussos conjecture, including cases involv-
ing gravitational collapse or other strong gravitational inter-
actions. as with boussos bound, if the holographic principle
is indeed part of a fundamental theory, it may be that the hy-
potheses discussed here will provide clues to its formulation.
note that we do not show in this paper that the entropy
bound (1.8) bound can be saturated by entropy 4-currents sa
satisfying our assumptions. however, consideration of sim-
ple examples shows that this bound comes within a factor of
order unity of being saturated by currents satisfying our sec-
ond set of hypotheses (1.10) and (1.11). also, a simple scal-
ing argument shows that the least upper bound on the ratio
sl/(ab  ab  ) for currents satisfying our assumptions is of
the form 2f (12
2 ) for some function f . as a result, at
xed 12
the least upper bound depends continuously on
2
2. this guarantees that there exist some values of 1 and
2, of order unity, such the entropy bound (1.8) is both sat-
ised and can be saturated by entropy currents satisfying the
inequalities (1.10) and (1.11). a similar statement is true for
the hypothesis (1.9).

appendix a: formula for integral over null

hypersurface

is parallel transported along each null generator of l with re-
spect to the connection (a6):

in this appendix we derive the formula (2.6) for the integral

sl =zl

saabcd

(a1)

of the entropy current over the null hypersurface l [cf.
eq. (2.4) above], using the coordinate system (, x) =
(, x1, x2) dened in sec. ii.

we start by discussing the relation between tensors on the
spacetime m and tensors on the null surface l. we introduce
the notation that capital roman indices a, b, c, . . . denote ten-
sors on l, in the sense of the abstract index convention of ref.
[14]. for any 1-form wa dened on l, we will denote the pull-
back of wa to l as

wa = p a

awa;

(a2)

a. since ka is normal to l, the
this denes the operator p a
pullback of ka vanishes, so p a
aka = 0. using the null tetrad
introduced at the beginning of section ii, we can dene a sim-
ilar mapping between vectors on m and vectors on l. at any
point p in l, the projection operation
b + lakb)vb

(a3)

va  (a

maps the 4-dimensional tangent space tp (m ) into the 3-
dimensional tangent space tp(l). thus can write the map-
a va, which denes the operator
ping (a3) as va  va = qa
a . note that the vector la is annihilated by the projection
qa
operation (a3), while ka and vectors perpendicular to ka and
la are unchanged. we dene ka = qa
a ka = (d/d)a, which
is the tangent vector in l the generators of l.

consider now the integrand in the integral (a1). it is pro-

portional to

sa k[albecfd],

(a4)

where ea and f a are spacelike vector elds such that
{ka, la, ea, f a} is an orthonormal basis. when we pullback
the 3-form (a4) to l, all the terms where the index on ka is
free and not contracted with sa will be annihilated. hence
without loss of generality we can replace sa with (sbkb)la.
thus we obtain from eqs. (a1) and (2.5) that

sl =zl

s abc,

(a5)

where s = saka and where the 3-form abc is dened in eq.
(2.5) above.
as a tool for evaluating the integral (a5), we dene an in-

duced connection da on l by

davb = p c

a qb

d cvd

(a6)

kada bcd = 0.

(a7)

this follows from the fact that ka, la and abcd are paral-
lel transported along each generator with respect to the 4-
dimensional connection. next, consider the lie derivative
l~k of abc with respect to ka. since the result is a 3-form
we must have

(cid:0)l~k(cid:1)abc =  abc,

(a8)

for some scalar eld . we can dene a upper index volume
form abc by the requirement that

abc abc = 3!.

(a9)

[a denition is terms of raising indices is inapplicable here
since there is no natural non-degenerate metric on l.] now
contracting both sides of eq. (a8) with abc and using eq.
(a7) yields

 = daka = aka,

(a10)

which is just the usual expansion .

next, we dene a 3-form abc on l by demanding that
it coincide with abc on the 2-surface b, and that it be lie
transported along the generators of l. if we write abc =
abc, where  is a scalar eld on l, it follows from eq.
(a8) with  =  that

l~k = .

(a11)

solving this equation using the denition (2.3) of the area-
decrease factor yields  = a. thus we see that the geometri-
cal meaning of the factor a is that it is the ratio between the
lie-transported 3-volume form abc and the parallel trans-
ported 3-volume form abc, where in both cases one starts
from the 2-surface b.

consider now the specic coordinate system (, x) =
(, x1, x2). in this coordinate system the fact that abc is
lie transported along the generators translates into




x1x2 (, x) = 0,

so that

x1x2(, x) = x1x2(0, x) =pdet h(x),

where x1x2(, x) denotes one of the coordinate compo-
nents of the tensor abc in the coordinate system (, x),
x  (x1, x2) as before, and h is the induced 2-metric on
b. it follows that

(a12)

(a13)

where vd is any vector eld on m with va = qa
b vb. one
can check that this formula denes a derivative operator on
l. next we note that the pullback abc of the 3-form (2.5)

note however that unlike the situation in the four dimensional set-
ting, in general da bcd 6= 0, i.e., abc is not covariantly constant
with respect to da.

9

x1x2(, x) = a(, x)pdet h(x).

combining this with the formula (a5) for the entropy ux -
nally yields the formula (2.6).
