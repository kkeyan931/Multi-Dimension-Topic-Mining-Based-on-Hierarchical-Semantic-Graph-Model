abstract

we give a simple proof of the known s-duality of heterotic string
theory compactied on a t6. using this s-duality we calculate the
tensions for a class of bps 5-branes in heterotic string theory on a
s1. one of these, the kaluza-klein monopole, becomes tensionless
when the radius of the s1 is equal to the string length. we study
the question of stability of the heterotic ns5-brane with a transverse

circle. for large radii the ns5-brane is absolutely stable. however

for small radii it is only marginally stable. we also study the moduli

space of 2 kaluza-klein monopoles and show that it is equal to the

moduli space of a heterotic a1 singularity.

introduction

in this paper we study various aspects of heterotic string theory [1]. heterotic
string theory compactied on t6 has a non-perturbative sl(2, z) duality.
the duality was rst presented by font, ibanez, lust and quevedo in [2].
evidence in favor of it was presented by a. sen in [3]. later the duality was

proven [4] by relating it to the duality between type iia on k3 and heterotic
on t4 [5]. here we present a simple proof of this strong-weak coupling duality
using only the fact that m-theory on a circle is type iia and t-dualities in
type ii.

we explore the consequences of this duality for heterotic string theory

on a circle with unbroken gauge group. we nd an exact formula for the
tension of the kaluza-klein monopole. the result is that the tension is

t = |

m6

where ms is the string mass, r is the radius of the circle and  is the heterotic
coupling constant. we see that at the selfdual radius, msr = 1, this 5-
brane becomes tensionless. this has some equivalent statements in some
dual systems. for instance compactifying this further on a t3 this system is
dual to type iia on k3 with a d6-brane wrapped on the k3. the statement
here is that the resulting 2-brane becomes tensionless for a certain value of

the volume of the k3.

we also study the stability of a heterotic ns5-brane with a transverse

circle. it turns out that for large radii the ns5-brane is completely stable, but
for radii smaller than the selfdual radius the ns5-brane is only marginally
stable. it can split into two 5-branes, whose sum of tensions is equal to the

ns5-brane tension.

finally we discuss the moduli space of two kaluza-klein monopoles. the

moduli space of ade singularities has recently been studied [6, 7, 8, 9]. in the
case of an a1 singularity the moduli space was found to be the atiyah-hitchin

1

space. we show explicitly following the methods of [6] that the moduli space
of two kaluza-klein monopoles is still the atiyah-hitchin space.
in other

words the transverse circle does not change the moduli space.

the organisation of the paper is as follows. in section(1) we explain and

prove the strong-weak coupling duality of 4-dimensional heterotic theory. in
section(2) we study a certain class of 5-branes of the heterotic theory on a
circle and nd the tensions for those 5-branes which are bps. we nd that a

certain 5-brane becomes tensionless when the radius of the compactication
circle is selfdual under t-duality. in section(3) we identify this 5-brane as

the taub-nut solution, also called the kaluza-klein monopole. in section(4)
we study the question of stability of the ns5-brane in 9-dimensional het-

erotic theory. in section(5) we study the moduli space of two kaluza-klein
monopoles.

1 proof of sl(2,z) duality

heterotic string theory compactied on a t6 is known to have a moduli space
which is

(o(22, r)  o(6, r))\o(22, 6, r)/o(22, 6, z)
so(2, r)\sl(2, r)/sl(2, z)

the u-duality group is

o(22, 6, z)  sl(2, z)

the o(22, 6, z) is the perturbative t-duality group. the sl(2, z) is a non-
perturbative duality. evidence in favor of it was presented by a. sen in [3].

the evidence consisted of four pieces:

 the low energy equations of motion had the symmetry.
 the allowed spectrum of electric and magnetic charges was consistent

with the duality.

2

 agreement of certain bps masses in 4 dimensions.
 certain yukawa couplings of bps saturated elds could be checked

explicitly.

later the duality was proven [4] by relating it to the duality between type
iia on k3 and heterotic on t4 [5]. by compactifying this duality further on
a t2 the non perturbative sl(2, z) on the heterotic side could be identied
with one of the sl(2, z) factors in the t-duality of the t2 on the type iia
side.

the aim of this section is to prove the existence of this sl(2, z) duality

in the heterotic theory on t6 in a simpler way.

the two dierent heterotic theories in 10 dimensions are dual when
compactied on a circle and certainly also on a t6, so we do not have
to distinguish between the two. the moduli of the compactication can
be parametrised as follows. there is the metric on t6, the b-eld on t6,
e8  e8 wilson lines on the 6 circles and the 4 dimensional string coupling,
. furthermore, and of central importance to this sl(2, z) duality, there is

a two-form in 4 dimensions coming from the ns-ns b-eld in 10 dimensions.
in 4 dimensions a two-form is dual to a scalar. hence we get another scalar,

a, called the axion. another way of understanding the scalar a is to dualise
the b-eld in ten dimensions to a six-form b(6). the integral of this six-form
on t6 gives a scalar in 4 dimensions. we can conveniently collect the string
coupling, , and the axion into a complex number in the upper halfplane,

 = a + i

1


the sl(2, z) duality acts as follows. it leaves the metric, the b2-eld on t6
and the wilson lines invariant and it acts on  as

 

p + q
r + s

3

where

(cid:18) p

r

q

s(cid:19)  sl(2, z)

it is well known that sl(2,z) is generated by the two elements

and

s = (cid:18) 0 1
0 (cid:19)

1

t = (cid:18) 1

0

1(cid:19)

(2)

(3)

(4)

to show the full sl(2, z) duality we thus just have to show that s and t
are dualities. t is actually still perturbative, since it it does not touch the

coupling. t shifts the axion. this is a symmetry as follows from the gauge
symmetry of the six-form, b(6) in ten dimensions. in four dimensions there
are instantons coming from euclidean ns5-branes wrapped on t6. they are
weighted with ei2a in the action, showing that a  a + 1 is a symmetry. it
is similar to the well known 2 shift of the -angle in 4 dimensional gauge

theories.

the non trivial point is to establish existence of the strong-weak duality,
s. to do that we will use the horava-witten picture of e8  e8 heterotic
string theory [10]. by compactifying further on a t6 we see that the het-
erotic string on t6 can be represented as m-theory on t7 modded out by
a z2 symmetry. to be more precise, consider m-theory on r1,3  t7. the
coordinates on t7 are called x5, x6, . . . , x11. m-theory has a 3-form eld,
c (3). the z2 group is generated by an element  which acts as follows. 
is a parity operation on x11 and changes the sign of c (3). the parity opera-
tion alone is not a symmetry of m-theory because of the chern-simons term
in 11-dimensional supergravity. we will now perform a certain u-duality
transformation, say u, of m-theory on t7. then we will obtain m-theory on
another t7. the symmetry  will be mapped to another symmetry

 = uu 1

4

we now mod out by the respective symmetry on both sides and identify the
result. in other words m-theory on t7 modded out by  is dual to m-theory
on the dual t7 modded out by .

we will now dene the relevant u-duality transformation and track the
transformation of the elds. we start with m-theory on t7 with radii
r5, r6, . . . , r11. the 11-dimensional planck mass is called mp . we will
take the torus to be rectangular for simplicity. the chain of dualities is as

follows.

 (1)

go to type iia by using the 5th circle as the compactication circle.
the string mass, ms, coupling,  and radii, ri are

this is followed by another t-duality on the 5 circles with radii
r6, . . . , r10 which brings us back to type iia with parameters

i = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

finally we lift this up to m-theory by opening up a circle which is called
the 5th circle again. we arrive at m-theory on t7 with parameters

mp = m 5

we now have two dierent t7 compactications of m-theory which are dual.
actually the eleventh circle was not touched at all in this chain of dualities,
so the duality is already a duality of m-theory on t6. we now want to mod
out by respectively  and  and identify the resulting theories. to do that
we need to nd . in order to do that we must track the various elds of
m-theory under the duality. the bosonic elds are the metric gij and the 3-
form cij k and the dual 6-form cij klm n. the 3-form and 6-form are related

6

but it is still an advantage to keep track of both as we will see below. under
 they transform as

gij  gij
gi(11)  gi(11)
cij k  cij k
cij(11)  cij(11)

i, j = 1, . . . , 10

i = 1, . . . , 10

i, j, k = 1, . . . , 10

i, j = 1, . . . , 10

cij klm n  cij klm n
cij klm (11)  cij klm (11)

i, j, k, l, m, n = 1, . . . , 10

i, j, k, l, m = 1, . . . , 10

the transformation law of the 6-form follows from the relation

dc (3) = dc (6)

(5)

we now claim that under the u-duality transformation a eld that transforms

with eigenvalue 1 is mapped into another eld with eigenvalue 1 and the same
is true for eigenvalue -1. to see that one has to track all the dierent elds

through the chain of dualities. let us here just do it explicitly for one case,
namely g1(10). in the rst step above it remains g1(10). in the second step
it becomes bn s
in the 4th step it
becomes c rr
16789. in the 5th step it becomes c156789. it is indeed true that
both g1(10) and c156789 have the same eigenvalue, namely 1.

in the third step it becomes brr

1(10).

1(10).

this implies that  = . we conclude that by modding out on both
sides by  we get a duality between two heterotic theories on t6. in the
horava-witten picture the relation between the m-theory parameters, mp
and the radius of the eleventh circle r11, and the heterotic parameters, ms
and  are

using these relations and eq.(5) we can relate the parameters of the heterotic
theory on one side of the duality with those on the other side.

this looks a bit messy but we can understand it better by expressing it in
the right variables. in the moduli space

(o(22, r)  o(6, r))\o(22, 6, r)/o(22, 6, z)
so(2, r)\sl(2, r)/sl(2, z)

the radii of the torus are contained in the rst factor and they are expressed

in string units. we easily calculate that

m2 ri = msri

i = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

(7)

this shows that the radii are unchanged in the right units. we could have
worked with a non-rectangular torus if we wanted to. since the rectangular

torus is unchanged it is clear that any torus would be left unchanged.

the second factor of the moduli space is a complex number in the upper
halfplane,  . the imaginary part of  is 1

string coupling. the relation between the four-dimensional and ten dimen-

sional coupling is

this derivation was done with zero axion, and hence is exactly the element,
s, of sl(2, z). we have now derived the existence of this duality only for a

8

subset of the whole moduli space. however the existence of a duality in just
one point implies that it extends to the whole moduli space. its action is to

leave the point in the rst factor invariant and act as

invariant. in this derivation the wilson lines could not be tracked since they

only exist after modding out. this nishes our proof of the strong-weak
duality. in the next section we will study some consequences of it.

2 tensionless 5-branes in heterotic string the-

ory on a circle

in this section we will study the heterotic theory on a circle of radius r. the
gauge group could be either e8  e8 or spin(32)
. for simplicity we take the
wilosn line on the circle to be zero so the gauge group is unbroken. there are
two u(1) gauge elds in 9 dimensions, namely g10 and b10. the charges
under these are respectively momentum amd winding. in perturbative string

z2

theory one can calculate the mass of ligthest particle with momentum m and
winding n. however it is only for certain m and n that the state is bps. in

the bps case the mass calculated at string tree-level is exact. the quantum
numbers and masses in the bps cases are [11]:

these conditions secure that there are no excited rightmoving oscillators.
the last two states become massless at the selfdual radius. they are the w-

bosons of the enhanced su(2) gauge symmetry. by compactifying further on
a t5 these particles still exist with the same masses. we can now apply the
s-duality transformation discussed in the previous section. let the radii of
the t5 be r5, r6, r7, r8, r9. the s-dual object of the particle with quantum
numbers (m, n) is a particle with a mass which is easily calculated to be.

m = |m

m6

2  n

m8

|r5r6r7r8r9

(11)

we see that it is a particle with a mass proportional to the volume of the
t5. this implies that it is a 5-brane in 9 dimensions with a tension of

t(m,n) = |m

(12)

these 5-branes are magnetically charged under the two u(1) gauge elds
in 9 dimensions. the quantum number m denotes ns5-brane charge. an
ns5-brane indeed has tension

t(1,0) =

m6
s
2

(13)

the quantum number n denotes the kaluza-klein monopole charge. in other
words the circle of the compactication can be in a non-trivial bundle over the
transverse r3 at innity. n measures the rst chern class of this bundle. the
5-branes are bps whenever the dual particles are. let us look closer at one of
the special cases listed above,m = 1, n = 1. the other one m = 1, n = 1
is just the antibrane. this bps 5-brane has a tension which is

t(1,1) = |

(14)

we see that for large r it is heavy but for the selfdual radius msr = 1 it is
tensionless. what is this 5-brane? in the next section we will see that it is
the taub-nut space solution.

10

let us see how the two kinds of branes transform under t-duality. het-
erotic string theory with gauge group, g, on a circle without a wilson line

has a t-duality that preserves the gauge group. the relation between the
original parameters and the new ones is

(15)

with the same ms. there is a gauge eld, g10, in 9 dimensions coming from
the metric and a gauge eld, b10, coming from the b-eld. the electric
charge for g10 is momentum around the circle. the magnetic charge is
kaluza-klein monopole charge. the electric charge for b10 is string winding
and the magnetic charge is ns5-brane charge. these two gauge elds are
swapped under the t-duality. momentum and winding are swapped and

kaluza-klein and ns5-brane charges are swapped. under t-duality of the
s1 the quantum numbers m, n are mapped as follows

m  n,

n  m

especially the taub-nut space is mapped to the taub-nut space with oppo-

site orientation.

(m, n) = (1, 1)  (m, n) = (1,1)

3 the taub-nut solution in the heterotic string

theory on a circle

in this section we will discuss the supergravity solution for the taub-nut 5-

brane in the heterotic string theory compactied on a circle down to 9 dimen-
sions. supergravity solutions for monopoles in compactied heterotic string

theories have been discussed extensively in the litterature [12, 13, 14, 15].

11

we review parts of the construction in order to understand that the brane
with charges (1, 1) is the taub-nut 5-brane. the gauge group could be ei-
ther e8  e8 or spin(32)
. it will not make a dierence for our purpose. we
will take no wilson line on the circle and hence keep the gauge group un-

z2

broken. by 5-brane we understand an object with 5+1 dimensional lorentz
invariance and localised in the 3 transverse directions. there are two ba-
sic types of these, namely the ns5-brane and the kaluza-klein monopole.

here we only discuss the kaluza-klein monopole also called taub-nut space.
the ns5-brane exists already in 10 dimensions and the 9 dimensional one is

trivially obtained from the 10 dimensional one. 5-branes in 10 dimensions
were discussed in [16]. the kaluza-klein monopole, on the other hand, only

exists after compactication. now we will discuss the supergravity solution
of this object closely following the discussion of [16]. as we will see be-

low the kaluza-klein monopole preserves half of the supersymmetry, i.e. 8
supercharges.

the eld content of the heterotic string theory in 10 dimensions is the
metric, m n , the dilaton, , a two-form potential, b, a gauge potential, a, a
gaugino , a dilatino,  and a gravitino, m . the bosonic part of the action
in 10 dimensions reads

here  is the innitesimal supersymmetry parameter.  is a majorana-weyl
spinor of so(1, 9). it has 16 real components.

let the radius of s1 be r. the metric is a product of at r1,5 and the 4

where,

and ai is the gauge eld of a monopole centered at the origin. the taub-nut
space has the following desirable properties,

 if we excise the origin, what remains is a circle bration over r3 {0}.
eq.(24) is written such that ~x is the coordinate on this base r3 
{0}. for |~x| restricted to a constant, the bration is exactly the hopf
bration of s3 over s2.

13

 the origin ~x = 0 is a smooth point.
 as |~x|   the radius of the ber becomes r.
 the space has a u(1) isometry group that preserves the origin ~x = 0.

an element g() = ei  u(1) acts by y  y + .

we will now show that this space with a constant dilaton and all other elds
set to zero is a supersymmetry preserving solution to zeroth order in .

firstly eq.(17) is trivially satised to zeroth order in . the supersymmetry
variation of  and  are zero since the right hand sides are zero for any .
the only nontrivial equation is the gravitino variation which now reads

m = (m +

 ab
m ab) = m 

(25)

where  is the covariant derivative in the taub-nut metric. taub-nut space
is a noncompact calabi-yau manifold. it has su(2) holonomy, which implies
that there are covariantly constant spinors of one chirality, say positive. more

concretely the spin connection satises

m = abcd cd
 ab

m

(26)

where abcd is the totally antisymmetric symbol with 1234 = 1. positive
chirality means that

combining the three equations above we get

1234+ = +

m = m +

(27)

(28)

this is zero for a constant +. there are no unbroken supersymmetries of
negative chirality. since the original supersymmetry was a majorana-weyl
spinor of positive chirality in 9+1 dimensions the unbroken supersymmetry

is a positive chirality spinor in the 5+1 dimensions along the worldvolume of

14

the brane. to higher order in  the solution changes. for instance eq.(17)
implies that h is nonzero to rst order in . the variation of the dilatino,

, then implies that the dilaton becomes non constant to rst order in
. one should imagine correcting the solution order by order in . to

do that consistently we should also include higer order corrections in the
original action. the point is however that there is a solution to all orders
in  and the string coupling too for that sake. the exact solution will

preserve supersymmetry. this is so because a bps state comes in a small
representation of the supersymmetry algebra. the size of a representation

cannot jump when the parameters of the theory are changed continously.
until we have a full non perturbative formulation of string theory the only

way to specify solutions is to do it in some approximation, like weak coupling.
these solutions will then give rise to exact solutions.

let us nd the charges of this solution. the charges are integers and
can not jump with  so we should be able to identify the charges working
to lowest non-trivial order. as we saw above there are two relevant 5-brane

charges,m and n. m denotes the magnetic charge of the 3-form eld,

m =

1

162 zs2s1

h

(29)

n denotes the rst chern class of the circle-bration at innity. in this case
n = 1. what about m. in type ii theories m would be zero but it is dierent

in the heterotic theory due to the bianchi identity eq.(18). the bianchi
identity implies that the curvature induces magnetic charge of the b-eld.

we get

m =

1

162 zs2s1

l

3 () = 1

(30)

the higher order  corrections cannot change an integer as already noted.
we thus conclude that the taub-nut space is the 5-brane discussed in the
previous section with quantum numbers (1, 1). since it preserves some super-

symmetry its tension is given exactly by the formula derived in the previous

15

section.

the second one. the second term is the adm mass of the pure taub-nut

solution. the rst term would appear when taking the  corrections into
account.

4 the marginally stable ns5-brane

in this section we will study the stability of the ns5-brane in the heterotic
theory on a circle. the ns5-brane is a bps 5-brane. it has quantum numbers

(m = 1, n = 0) in the notation from section 2. it has tension

t(1,0) =

m6
s
2

(32)

since it is bps it cannot decay into 5-branes of a total tension which is
smaller than t(1,0). it could be however that it could split into two or more
5-branes whose tension add up to t(1,0). the central charge for a 5-brane
with charges (m, n) is

z(m,n) = m

m6
s
2  n

m8
sr2
2

the bps inequality reads

t(m,n)  |z(m,n)|

(33)

(34)

suppose that the ns5-brane can split into two 5-branes of charges (m1, n1)
and (m2, n2). then they must both be bps and have positive central charge.

n1 + n2 = 0

the condition that they are bps is written down in section 2.
it is that
either m and n have opposite sign or they are both 1 or both 1. it is easily
seen that all these requirements are only satised if

(m1, n1) = (1, 1)
(m2, n2) = (0,1)

or vice versa and furthermore

msr  1

we thus conclude that for large radius the ns5-brane is absolutely stable
as one would expect. however for a radius smaller than the selfdual radius

the ns5-brane is only marginally bound. it can split into the 5-branes with
charges (1, 1) and (0,1). the one with charge (1, 1) is the taub-nut space
discussed in the previous section. the (0,1) 5-brane can be thought of as
an anti taub-nut space bound with a ns5-brane.

5 the moduli space of taub-nut 5-branes

in this section we will discuss the moduli space of several taub-nut 5-branes,
or kaluza-klein monopoles, in the heterotic theory on a circle. in section(3)

we presented the supergravity solution for one taub-nut 5-brane. the case
of q parallel taub-nut 5-branes is similar. the metric is to lowest order the

q-centered taub-nut space with metric

ds2 = r2u(dy  aidxi)2 + u 1(d~x)2,
where,

i = 1 . . . 3,

0  y  2. (35)

and ai is the gauge eld of q monopoles centered at xl, l = 1, . . . , q. this
space is smooth except when two or more centers coincide. for n coinciding

centers the space develops an r4/zn orbifold singularity. an r4/zn orbifold
singularity is also sometimes denoted a an1 singularity. the total charge of
this system is (q, q). a ns5-brane, which has charge (1, 0), can be thought
of as a small instanton [18].
in other words a ns5-brane can spread out

and become an instanton in the transverse space. the 5-branes with charge
(q, q) cannot spread out. their moduli space is 4q dimensional. 3q of these
dimensions come from specifying the q centers of the q-centered taub-nut

space. the last q parameters come from the b-eld. the q-centered taub-
nut space has q normalisable harmonic two-forms. the q scalars come from

expanding the b-eld into these q normalisable harmonic two-forms. these q
parameters are periodic due to gauge symmetry of the b-eld. it is equivalent

of periodicity of wilson lines of a gauge eld. 4 of these 4q dimensions
parametrise the center of mass motion, which is r3  s1. it decouples from
the rest of the moduli space.

the moduli space of q kaluza-klein monopoles has been argued by sen to
be equal to the moduli space of q bps monopoles in four-dimensional n = 4
su(2) gauge theory [19]. for coinciding 5-branes the space has an aq1
singularity. the moduli space of the heterotic theory on a aq1 singularity
has recently been studied by witten [6]. he conjectured that it is equal
to the moduli space of 3-dimensional n = 4 pure gauge theory with gauge
group su(q). similar statements were conjectured for d and e groups. in
the case of q = 2 it was shown explicitly that the moduli space is equal to
the atiyah-hitchin space. shortly after, wittens conjecture was proven by

means of string dualities [7, 8, 9].

the purpose of this section is to prove that the moduli-space of the two-

centered taub-nut space is equal to the atiyah-hitchin space.
in other
words the moduli space does not depend on the radius r of the circle at

innity. this result follows from sens identication of this moduli space
with a monopole moduli space, but here we will prove it with a dierent

argument. we will show this by following wittens approach [6] and see that

18

the argument used in the case of an a1 singularity also goes through in the
case of two-centered taub-nut space.

firstly the moduli space is a hyper-kahler manifold. this is because it is
the moduli space in a 6-dimensionsonal theory with 8 supercharges without

gravity. there is no gravity because the transverse space is noncompact the
6-dimensional gravitational constant is zero. hence the moduli space is that
of a globally supersymmetric theory, i.e. hyper-kahler.

the moduli space is independent of the string coupling constant, since it
is a hypermultiplet moduli space. by further compactifying to 4 dimensions

the string coupling sits in a vector multiplet moduli space and hence does
not correct the hypermultiplet moduli space [20]. it can hence be studied in

heterotic conformal theory.

discarding the center of mass motion the moduli space is 4 dimensional.

when the 2 5-branes are far away from each other the moduli space is
parametrised by the separation, ~x, and the integral of the b-eld along the ex-
ceptional divisor. to lowest order in  the moduli space is just (r3s1)/z2.
the z2 is due to the indistinguishability of the 2 branes. interchanging them
changes the orientation on the exceptional divisor and hence changes the sign

of the integral of the b-eld.

in the case of an a1 singularity witten showed that  corrections change
the topological structure of the moduli space at innity. the circle is not in a
product with r3 at innity but is in a nontrivial circle bundle of rst chern
class 4. exactly the same is true here as we will now argue. the actual
heterotic spacetime is of course dierent in this case compared to the case
of a pure singularity but the circle in the moduli space behaves similarly.

when the two 5-branes are on top of each other, the taub-nut space
has an exact u(1)  su(2) symmetry. the u(1) tranalates along the circle
in taub-nut space. the su(2) rotates the r3. when the two 5-branes
are separated the su(2) acts on their separation vector. so we have an

exact su(2) that acts on the moduli space. the u(1) does not act on the

19

moduli space.
in the case of the a1 singularity there was a spin(4) =
su(2)l  su(2)r which acted on the space. the su(2)r acts on the moduli
space whereas the su(2)l does not. the important point is that in our
case we do still have a su(2) that acts on the moduli space. at innity
the moduli space is approximately (r3  s1)/z2. the su(2) rotates the
r3. the question of what bundle the circle is in over the r3 at innity is
the same as asking how the su(2) acts on the circle. let us x a specic
point, ~x, in r3. there is a u(1) subgroup of su(2) which leaves this point
invariant. this u(1) will act on the s1 with a charge k. this k is exactly
the rst chern class of the bundle. hence we have to determine k. k can
be determined in the same way as in the case of the pure a1 singularity [6].
here we will consider a worldsheet instanton, i.e. a fundametal euclidean
string wrapped on the exceptional divisor. the partition function of this

string should be invariant under the u(1) which leaves ~x invariant. there
are two potential non-invariances of this partition function. one comes from
the path integral over worldsheet fermions which gives a factor of the pfaan
of the worldsheet dirac operator, p f (d). the other is the coupling of the
b-eld to the fundamental string exp(ir b). the product of the two

p f (d)exp(iz b)

(36)

should be invariant under u(1). performing a u(1) transformation ei the

factor exp(ir b) get multiplied by eik, where k is the rst chern class
which we want to nd. p f (d) gets multiplied with ein where n is the total
u(1) charge of the fermionic zero modes of the dirac operator. for this to be
invariant we must have k = n. hence we just have to count the total charge
of the fermionic zero modes. in the case of the pure a1 witten counted this
to be 4. the point is now that the presence of the circle cannot change

this since it is an integer. more precisely, let r >> |~x| >> . then the

situation is almost indistinguishable to the case of a pure singularity and
n = 4. now deform r continously to any value. n stays an integer and hence

20

n = 4.

now we have established that the moduli space at innity is a circle
bration over r3 with rst chern class 4 and there is a su(2) symmetry
that acts on the moduli space with generic three-dimensional orbits. this
space should be modded out by z2. the moduli space is also smooth by
the argument in [6]. there is no u(1) that acts on the ber at innity. it
is broken by worldsheet instanton eects. as noted above the moduli space

is hyper-kahler. the point is now that there is a unique space with these
properties, namely the atiyah-hitchin space [21]. we thus conclude that the

moduli space of 2 kaluza-klein 5-branes is the atiyah-hitchin space.
