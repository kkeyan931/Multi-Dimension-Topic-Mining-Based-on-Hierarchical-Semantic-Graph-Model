it is shown that local symmetry transformations of the maximal ads
supergravity in seven-dimensional anti de sitter space induce those of

ary at innity. boundary values of the ads supergravity elds form a
supermultiplet of the conformal supergravity.

1. introduction

in the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] (for a review see, e.g., ref. [4].) a
supergravity in (d + 1)-dimensional anti de sitter space is dual to a conformal eld
theory on d-dimensional boundary at innity. boundary values of supergravity elds
play a role of sources for operators of the conformal eld theory [2, 3]. it was noted
in refs. [5, 6] that these boundary elds should form supermultiplets of a conformal
supergravity in d dimensions. conformal supergravities are theories which have
weyl and super weyl symmetries in addition to local symmetries of the poincare
supergravities.

in refs. [7, 8] we explicitly showed such a relation between ads supergravities
and conformal supergravities in the case of three-dimensional anti de sitter space.
it was shown that local symmetry transformations of the bulk ads supergravi-
ties induce local transformations of the boundary elds, which coincide with those
of two-dimensional conformal supergravities. in particular, weyl and super weyl
transformations on the boundary are generated from general coordinate and super
transformations in the bulk. thus, the boundary elds form a supermultiplet of
the conformal supergravities. a relation between local symmetries in the bulk and
those on the boundary is also discussed in ref. [9].

the purpose of this paper is to study a similar relation between an ads super-
gravity and a conformal supergravity in the case of seven-dimensional anti de sitter
space. it is shown that local transformations of the maximal ads supergravity in
seven dimensions [10] induce those of the n = (2, 0) conformal supergravity in six
dimensions [11] on the boundary. the seven-dimensional maximal supergravity ap-
pears in a compactication of the m-theory on ads7  s4 [12], which corresponds to
a conguration of n m5-branes in the large n limit [1]. a new feature in this case
is the presence of third rank antisymmetric tensor elds in the seven-dimensional
supergravity. they satisfy a so-called self-duality in odd dimensions [13] by eld
equations. we show that they become self-dual antisymmetric tensor elds of the
six-dimensional conformal supergravity on the boundary.

as in refs. [7, 8] we partially x the gauge for local symmetries in the bulk. our
gauge choice is a sort of axial gauge, in which the direction normal to the boundary
is distinguished. we rst obtain boundary behaviors of all the elds and the gauge
transformation parameters after the gauge xing by eld equations and residual
symmetry equations. substituting them into the local symmetry transformations

2

we obtain the conformal supergravity transformations on the boundary.

the eld content of the maximal ads supergravity in seven dimensions [10] is
m , real third rank antisymmetric tensor
a vielbein em
elds sm n p,i, so(5)g vector elds bm,i
i and scalar elds
i. we denote seven-dimensional world indices as m, n,   = 0, 1,   , 6 and local
i
lorentz indices as a, b,   = 0, 1,   , 6. the indices i, j,   = 1,   , 5 are vector
indices of so(5)g, while i, j,   = 1,   , 5 and , ,   = 1,   , 4 are vector and
spinor indices of so(5)c respectively. so(5)g and so(5)c are local symmetries of the
theory, which will be discussed later. the at metric is ab = diag(1, +1,   , +1)
and the totally antisymmetric tensor m1m7 is chosen as 0123456 = +1. we need two
kinds of gamma matrices: 88 matrices a for the seven-dimensional lorentz group
so(1,6) and 44 matrices  i for so(5)c satisfying {a, b} = 2ab, { i,  j} = 2ij.
s and  s with multiple indices are antisymmetrized products of gamma matrices
with unit strength. in particular, we have a1a7 = a1a7. the dirac conjugate
of a spinor  is dened as  = i0. the spinor elds satisfy a symplectic majorana
condition  = c t
 , where c = c t and  = t are charge conjugation
matrices of so(1,6) and so(5)c satisfying

c 1ac = (a)t ,

3. boundary behaviors of the elds

we partially x the gauge for the local symmetries (7) and (8). the seven-
dimensional ads space is represented as a region r  x6 > 0 in r7 with coordinates
xm . the boundary of the ads space corresponds to a hyperplane r = 0 and a point
r = . we choose the gauge xing condition as
a = 0,

6 = 0,

2mr

r = 0,

ij = 0,

t = ,

(9)

where , ,   = 0,   , 5 and a, b,   = 0,   , 5 are six-dimensional world indices
and local lorentz indices respectively. the metric in this gauge has a form

dxm dxn gm n =

1

(2mr)2 (cid:16)dr2 + dxdx g(cid:17) .

(10)

the so(6,2) invariant ads metric corresponds to the case g =  but we consider
bab. an so(6,2) invariant eld
the general g. we dene e
conguration

a by g = e

g =  ,

i = i

other elds = 0.

(11)

is a solution of eld equations derived from the lagrangian (2).

let us obtain asymptotic behaviors of the elds near the boundary r = 0. the
boundary conditions are chosen such that they are consistent with these boundary
a behaves as r1 just as in the so(6,2)
behaviors. we assume that the vielbein e
invariant case (11). boundary behaviors of other elds are determined by their eld
equations. for the scalar elds i
i we rst expand them around the background
(11) as

i = ( e)i

i = j

i + o(3)(cid:19) ,

(12)

where ij = ji and i
for the scalar elds in the background (11) is

i = 0. near the boundary r = 0 the linearized eld equation

r7r(cid:16)r5r(cid:17) + 8 = 0.

(13)

assuming   rs for r  0, we obtain two independent solutions:   r2 and   r4.
the solution regular in the bulk is a linear combination of these two solutions and
its boundary behavior is determined by a solution which becomes larger near the
boundary, i.e.,   r2. the same reasoning can be applied to other elds discussed
below. for the vector elds bm the linearized eld equation is

r(cid:16)r3rb(cid:17) = 0.

(14)

we nd two solutions: b  r0 and b  r4.

for the antisymmetric tensor elds sm n p the linearized eld equation is

1
6

m n p q1q4fq1q4 + 16mesm n p = 0.

(15)

by the (m n p ) = (r) components of this equation the components sr can be
expressed by using s as

sr = 

r
12

1411    44[1s234].

(16)

therefore they are not independent degrees of freedom and behave as sr  rs+1
when s  rs. the (m n p ) = () components of the eld equation (15) become

rs

r

s  3[s]r = 0,

where the dual of s is dened as

s =

1
3!

e123 g11 g22 g33s123.

(17)

(18)

to solve this equation we introduce self-dual and anti self-dual parts of s as
s() = 1
  r2 and
s(+)
  r2, s()

2 (cid:16)s  s(cid:17). then we nd two solutions: s(+)

  r0, s()

  r4.

for spinor elds  the linearized eld equation is

r

2r

(2  6) + 6 = 0.

(19)

we dene the projections  = 1
2 (1  6) . note that 6 = 01    5 is the six-
dimensional chirality matrix and +,  are weyl spinors. we obtain two solutions:

knowing these boundary behaviors of the elds we impose dirichlet type bound-

where 0 = (e0
0, b0, 0+, 0) are arbitrary functions on the boundary.
note that we imposed the boundary conditions on only half of the components for
, s and  since their eld equations are rst order [14, 15]. other components
of the elds are expressed by the functions 0 by using the eld equations. the
elds 0 coincide with the eld content of the (2,0) conformal supergravity in six
dimensions [11]. the precise relation between 0 and the elds of the conformal
supergravity will be given below.

(21)

4. local symmetries on the boundary

we now study how the elds on the boundary 0 transform under residual symme-
try transformations after the gauge xing. we rst obtain the residual symmetries,
which preserve the gauge conditions (9). by solving dierential equations obtained
by taking variations of the gauge conditions (9) under the transformations (7), (8)

we nd parameters of the residual symmetry transformations near the boundary
r = 0 as

the transformations with the parameters

respectively. in particular, seven-dimensional general coordinate transformation in
the direction m = r became six-dimensional weyl transformation. weights of the
weyl transformation are determined by the powers of r appearing in the boundary
behaviors of the elds (21). the weights given in eq. (23) are consistent with those
of the conformal supergravity [11].

(28)

(29)

the transformations (27) coincide with those in the conformal supergravity [11].
the transformations with the parameters  and  represent local super and super
weyl transformations in six dimensions respectively. the bosonic transformations
of the elds dened in eq. (25) are easily obtained from eq. (23) and also coincide
with those in the conformal supergravity.

thus, we have shown that boundary values of the elds in the maximal ads
supergravity in seven dimensions form a supermultiplet of the n = (2, 0) conformal

11

supergravity in six dimensions, and that local symmetry transformations in the
bulk induce local transformations of the conformal supergravity on the boundary.
using these results we can compute anomalies of local symmetries on the boundary
as in the ads3/cft2 case [8] and obtain ward identities for correlation functions
of the boundary conformal eld theory. weyl anomaly in a purely gravitational
background was obtained in ref. [14]. the gauge anomaly is easily obtained from
the well-known relation between the chern-simons terms and chiral anomalies [16].
super weyl anomaly can be also obtained as in ref. [8].
