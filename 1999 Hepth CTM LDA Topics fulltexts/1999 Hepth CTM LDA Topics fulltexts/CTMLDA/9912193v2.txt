abstract

we argue that the familiar gauge hierarchy between the fundamental planck scale
mp l and the electroweak scale mw , can be naturally explained in higher dimensional
theories with relatively large radii (rc > 1/mp l) extra dimensions. in particular,
we show that it is possible that the electroweak higgs mass at high energies is of
the order of mp l, but radiative corrections drive it to an infrared stable xedpoint
 mw at low energies thus inducing a large hierarchy without any ne tuning of
parameters.

despite the fact that the standard model (sm) of strong and electroweak
interactions successfully describes all observed phenomena at currently acces-
sible energies mw  100 gev, there are several indications for new physics
beyond the sm to exist. from the theoretical point of view, perhaps the most
strict hint for such new physics is the gauge hierarchy problem which deals
with the natural explanation not only of the hierarchy of scales, mw /  1,
but also of the stability of this hierarchy under the quantum corrections, where
the sm is regarded as a lowenergy limit of a certain more fundamental theory
with characteristic scale  ( can be, say, the grand unied scale mgu t  1016
gev, or the planck scale mp l  1018 gev). the solution to this problem in
four dimensions has been usually attributed to supersymmetric models, or
models with dynamical gauge symmetry breaking with characteristic scales of
the order of tev.

on the other hand, it is widely believed that a unied theory of all funda-
mental forces in nature (including gravity) can be consistently constructed
in space-time with more than four dimensions. that is why the novel attack
to the gauge hierarchy problem within the higher dimensional theories, much
motivated by studies of nonperturbative superstring and mtheories, has re-
cently received considerable attention. it has been proposed in [1] that the
fundamental planck scale can be as low as few tev, requiring the presence of
two extra compact dimensions at least with submillimeter radii, rc = 1
 1
c
mm, and that sm particles and forces are conned on a 3brane in the extra
dimensions in order to avoid the conict with presently accessible experiments.
however, while this scenario does eliminate the hierarchy between the weak
mw and planck scale mp l, it introduces a new hierarchy between c and mw
( c
) and stability of large extra dimensions also remains as a criti-
mw
cal question. in this connection, another distinct higher dimensional scenario
proposed in [2] provides an exponential hierarchy between the weak mw and
planck mp l scales through the special solutions for the vedimensional ein-
stein equation with the cosmological constant and 3branes involving warp
factor in the metric tensor [3] 3 . then the required hierarchy is naturally gen-
erated even with small extra dimensions ( c
 102), so the model easily
mp l
avoids current constraints from particle physics [5], astrophysics and cosmol-
ogy [6] 4 . several studies of rich phenomenological and cosmological conse-
quences of such a scenario have been proposed recently [9]. note, however,
that a common deciency of the presented models is the ad hoc ne tunings

 mw
mp l

3 a remarkable thing oered by such a solutions is the possibility to reproduce
the fourdimensional newtons law in our universe even with innitely large (non
compact) extra dimensions. however, to solve the gauge hierarchy problem in this
case more complex constructions are required [4].
4 it has been emphasized in [7] the troubles with cosmological expansion in the
scenario where the sm is placed on the 3brane with negative tension [2]. also, the
diculty to reproduce gauge coupling unication is pointed out in [8].

2

required between the cosmological constants in the bulk and on the 3branes,
in order to obtain the desired solution to the einstein equations. the stability
of such ne tuning seems also to be problematic.

in this paper we suggest a new mechanism for gauge hierarchy in higher di-
mensional theories with relatively large radii compact extra dimensions. we
explore the old idea that the large hierarchy of scales can be explained with-
out any ne tuning of parameters if the electroweak higgs boson anomalous
mass dimension is a  2 [10] 5 . however, a  2 is highly undesirable, since
anomalous mass dimension a, being proportional to coupling constants, is
usually  1, unless some of the couplings (higgs selfinteracting coupling
or/and yukawa couplings) are nonperturbative below the scale , or there
is an unrealistically large number of degrees of freedom ensuring a  2 [10].
needless to say, that it is very dicult (if ever possible) to construct a realistic
model obeying such conditions. in higher dimensional theories, however, the
situation is drastically changed. the point is that, owing to the powerlaw (in
contrast to the logarithmic in four dimensions) evolution of the theory param-
eters, the higgs vacuum expectation value (vev), while being of the order of
 at high energies, rapidly decrease down to the infrared stable xed point
 mw even for the small values of a, thus naturally inducing a large hierarchy
even in the case of sm with the ordinary number of colours and avours. let
us demonstrate this phenomenon explicitly on the simplied example of the
su(n)symmetric higgsyukawa system with nc colours.

our starting action in d = 4+ dimensions ( is the number of extra compact
dimensions) is

s0 = z d4+[z(0)+  2(0)+ +

1
2
+zl(0)lil + zr(0)rir
+(cid:16)h(0)lr + h.c.(cid:17)],

(0)(cid:16)+(cid:17)2

(1)

where  is an ncomponent complex scalar eld, l is an ncomponent left
handed fermion eld with nc colours and r is a righthanded su(n/2)
singlet fermion with nc colours again. z, zl, and zr in (1) are the eld
renormalization factors which we choose to be equal to 1 at the scale 0. in
the case of n = 2 and nc = 3 the action (1) is just the sm action in the limit
of vanishing gauge couplings and higgsyukawa couplings except for one type
of quarks.

theory with action (1) in higher dimensions ( 6= 0) is known to be non
renormalizable, but it can be well dened by introducing an ultraviolet cuto
0, which is natural to identify with the fundamental planck scale mp l. at

5 somewhat similar idea have been proposed in [11] to study the patterns of gut
symmetry breaking.

3

low energies one can consistently describe the theory using wilsonian eective
action approach [12] 6 . the basic idea behind this approach is rst to integrate
out momentum modes between a cuto scale 0 and lower energy scale ,
rather than to integrate over all momentum modes in one go. the remaining
integral from  to zero may again be expressed as a partition function, but the
bare action s0 (1) is replaced by a complicated eective action s (wilsonian
eective action) and the overall cuto 0 by the eective cuto , in such
a way that all physics, i.e. green functions, are left invariant. the dierence
in s induced by the change of the cuto is determined integrating shell
modes with momenta between  and  +  and for an innitesimal 
becomes a gaussian path integral which can be exactly carried out. thus,
the scale dependence of the wilsonian eective action is given by the exact
functional dierential equation



s


= o[s] ,

(2)

where o[s] is a nonlinear operator acting on the functional s. however,
for the practical calculations it is inevitable to approximate the evolution
equation (2). usually, one expands the eective action s in terms of the
number of derivatives included in the general operators. in the rst order of
this approximation any derivative couplings are dropped except for the kinetic
term. this is the socalled local potential approximation (lpa) [14], which
we adopt here. in the sharp cuto scheme we obtain the renormalization
group (rg) equation for the local eective scalar potential (wegnerhoughton
equation):

( is the euler function). now, since we are interested in the spontaneously

(7)

where we have denoted the scalar quadric coupling as ()  u2() =
 2v
. by substituting (5) into (3), it will be also easy to obtain an in-

nite set of coupled rg equations for ui() =  iv

(i = 3, 4, ...) couplings,

thus, the wilson rg framework allows, in principle, to take into account
higherdimensional operators in the evolution of couplings in (5). however,
we restrict ourself to consider only the potential in the vicinity of 0() ap-
proximated by a 4potential. this corresponds to the truncation

u3 = u4 = ... = 0 .

(16)

where we have expanded the righthand sides of equations (14) and (16) in

(17)

and, as we will show below, correctly reproduce the results of the standard
oneloop perturbation theory. actually, the relations 2rr(ms) = m2
s and
h2
rr(mf ) = m2
f determine the physical masses of the scalar radial mode and
the fermion eld, respectively, and thus below the scales ms and mf scalar
and fermion elds become decoupled correspondingly.

a of eq. (15), which appears in the last term of (14) is just the anomalous
dimension for the vev of the scalar eld. clearly, a has to be evaluated at

6

the critical value cr

r , which is dened by solving (14) with rst term only

cr
r (  0) = 0 .

(18)

the critical value cr
r corresponds to the phase transition between the sym-
metric and spontaneously broken phases. thus the anomalous a has a simple
physical interpretation [17]: it governs the scale dependence of the deviation
of scalar eld vev from the critical value (18) resulting to the nonzero vev
for the scalar eld

(19)

(20)

the evolution equation for the renormalized yukawa coupling hr can be also
derived from the eective action s with nonzero fermion background elds
. keeping the leading o(h4

r) terms one obtains

(21)

it is obvious that the set of the rg equations (16), (20) and (21) is approxi-
mately valid for   c if some spatial dimensions are compactied. here we
simply ignore the threshold eects and assume that below the compactication
scale c the theory is fourdimensional, while above c it is ddimensional
with at (noncompact)  extra dimensions. in d dimensions one can dene
eective fourdimensional parameters by appropriately rescaling the elds and
couplings 7 :

  (2rc)r ,
  (2rc)r ,
h  (2rc)
2 hr .



(22)

for the fourdimensional renormalized parameters (22) we nally obtain the

(23c)

note, that by taking  = 0 the set of eqs. (23a-c) correctly reproduces the
familiar oneloop results of perturbation theory in four dimensions. the crucial
role of the extra dimensions in solving the gauge hierarchy problem can be seen
from eqs. (23a-c) even without performing numerical calculations. indeed,
ignoring for the moment the running of  and h, one nds from (23a)

where  = a/(). the exponential factor in (24) can be naturally small in
the case of extra dimensions ( 6= 0) even for small (but positive) values of ,
providing the desired hierarchy v(mw )
, while in four dimensions this
ratio is of the order of o(1  10) unless 0 = a0 & 2, that can, however, never
be obtained in perturbation theory since for small couplings a0 is proportional
to these couplings [10].

v(mp l)  mw

mp l

of course, the actual solutions of the set of eqs. (23a-c) is more complicated,
since the yukawa and selfinteraction couplings also exhibit fast (powerlaw)
running and the approximation of the constant  and h is very crude. we
have analyzed eqs. (23) numerically. the yukawa coupling h rapidly decreases
going down in the energy region between mp l and c and drives to the infrared
stable xedpoint h = 0. if the yukawa coupling dominates over the  (h2 
) 8 then  at the same time increases for smaller energies, until  becomes
large enough so that the terms proportional to 2 and h2 cancel the term
proportional to h4 in (23b). thus,  approaches the infrared stable xed
point,   h2. at the same time, even starting with large initial values of
v(mp l) . mp l, v rapidly decreases and below the c changes very slowly.
thus, for certain c and  the mean value of anomalous dimension a can be
equal to 2, which means that v2()
2 has an infrared stable quasi xedpoint.
if the parameters are in the vicinity of this xedpoint, one can naturally
explain the hierarchy v(mw )

.

v(mp l)  mw

mp l

such an approximate xedpoint behaviour of the parameters in our toy model
is expressed in figs. 1 and 2. we xed the values of selfinteraction coupling
and vev of the scalar eld at 174 gev to be (174 gev) = 0.25 and v(174
gev) = 174 gev and nd that small variation of the initial yukawa coupling

8 note that the strong and nearly equal yukawa couplings at higher energies provide
new explanation for the avour symmetry breaking in theories with extra dimen-
sions since they are exponentially suppressed at low energies due to the renormal-
ization eects [18]. quasi xedpoint solutions of high dimensional rg equations
in connection with fermion mass hierarchies are thoroughly discussed in [19]

8

h(174 gev) = 0.55 (from 0.545 to 0.555) leads to the very large range of
v(mp l) (from 105 to 1030 gev, see fig. 1) and (mp l) (from 0.03 to 0.35,
see fig. 2) at the planck scale for the compactication scale c = 1016.75gev
in the case of one extra dimension,  = 1. thus one can see, while the true
xedpoint corresponds to  = h = 0, relatively large values of  and h in the
infrared region can be obtained as well starting with the parameters at mp l
in a quite large interval. requiring that  and h are within the perturbative
regime ( 2
4 < 1) and that the relations (23a)-(23c) hold for the
whole interval between mw and mp l, our toy model predicts the upper bounds
on the physical masses of the scalar and fermion:

4 < 1 and h2

ms . 73 gev ,
mf . 100 gev .

(25)

it should be stressed that our solution to the gauge hierarchy problem does not
require the extra dimensions to be large. in fact, the hierarchy c
 0.050.3
mp l
is enough to get the desired values of v at low energies, even starting with nat-
urally expected large values of v at mpl (v(mpl)  mp l). this is demonstrated
in fig. 3, where we have plotted the evolution of v() for the case of  = 1, 2,
and 3 extra dimensions starting from v(mpl) = 1017gev. requiring that v(174
gev) = 174 gev and (174 gev) = 0.25, h(174 gev) = 0.55, we obtain
c = 1016.75, 1017.30, 1017.51 gev for  = 1, 2, and 3, respectively. for the sake
of comparison we have also plotted the running of v() in four dimensions
( = 0). one can see that a familiar ne tuning of parameters at the planck
scale is required in order to achieve the phenomenologically acceptable values
of v at low energies.

we conclude with the following comments. first, it is clear, that more accurate
calculations, related to an improved treatment of thresholds and contributions
beyond the lpa approximation and truncation (9) of the eective potential as
well as higher loop corrections quantitatively alter (perhaps quite signicantly)
our predictions for particle masses in (25), but qualitatively the behaviour of
the parameters seems to remain unchanged, thus providing us with a the
natural solution of the gauge hierarchy problem as discussed above. second,
while we have demonstrated our mechanism for the solution of the gauge
hierarchy problem on the simplied model of higgsyukawa interaction, we
nd no reason why it can not work in the realistic models when a full set of
the particles and forces of the sm or its extensions will be included. moreover,
several examples of nonsupersymmetric unication through extra dimensions
have been recently presented [20], so we believe that a unied model without
the gauge hierarchy problem and consistent with present experimental data
can be constructed elsewhere.

fig. 1 fixed-point behaviour of the scalar eld vev in the case of one extra
dimension (=1) with the compactication scale c = 1016.75 gev.
fig. 2 fixed-point behaviour of the scalar eld self-interaction coupling  in
the case of one extra dimension (=1) with the compactication scale c =
1016.75 gev.
fig. 3 the typical running of the scalar eld vev in the case of =1,2 and
3 extra dimensions with c = 1016.75, 1017.30, 1017.51 gev, respectively. the
values of vev v(mp l) = 1017 gev and v(174gev ) = 174 gev are xed. the
running in four dimensions (=0) with v(174gev ) = 174 gev xed is also
plotted.
