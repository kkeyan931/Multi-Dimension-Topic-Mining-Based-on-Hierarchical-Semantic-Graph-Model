we derive a u -duality invariant formula for the degeneracies of bps multiplets in a d1-d5

system for toroidal compactication of the type ii string. the elliptic genus for this system

vanishes, but it is found that bps states can nevertheless be counted using a certain topo-

logical partition function involving two insertions of the fermion number operator. this

is possible due to four extra toroidal u(1) symmetries arising from a wigner contraction
of a large n = 4 algebra a, for   . we also compare the answer with a count-
ing formula derived from supergravity on ads3  s3  t 4 and nd agreement within the
expected range of validity.

1. introduction

supersymmetric indices have proven to be invaluable in the program of accounting for

black-hole entropy using d-branes [1]. in particular, in those cases where the computation

of bps black holes can be related to counting functions in a conformal eld theory, the

elliptic genus has been of particular use. nevertheless, there are examples, notably toroidal

compactication of type ii string, where the relevant elliptic genus vanishes, thus giving

little indication about the d-brane bps state degeneracies. perhaps surprisingly, the
degeneracies are therefore more subtle for compactication on t 4 than for k3. these

degeneracies were rst seriously investigated in [2][3][4].

in this paper we study these

degeneracies further in the case of the three charge system of [1] consisting of q1 d1-

branes, q5, d5-branes and momentum n . using a function closely related to the elliptic

genus we derive e6,6(zz) u -dual expressions for the case of primitive charges, i.e., charges

such that gcd(q1, q5, n ) = 1. the formula is given in equations (6.2), (6.3) below and is

easily derived from our central result, the counting formula for 1/8 bps states given in

equation (5.9) below, valid for gcd(q1, q5) = 1.

our approach to the problem is to dene an index in the same spirit as the new

supersymmetric index of [5]. these authors investigated the traces in supersymmetric

quantum mechanics dened by:

e = trh(1)f f eh ,

(1.1)

where h is the hamiltonian and f is a fermion number operator. for n = 2 supersym-

metric theories one can take f to be the generator of a u (1) invariance and the index

with  = 1 is invariant under perturbations of d-terms (but not f -terms). moreover,

in general e has no special invariances for   2.

in this paper we consider the case

 = 2 in the context of certain conformal eld theories. in the problem of interest we have

some extra symmetry, namely the four u(1) translation symmetries of the torus. the full

symmetry is a wigner contraction of the large n = 4 supersymmetry algebra a, [6].

we show that the presence of this large n = 4 algebra leads to invariance of e=2 under

a class of perturbations discussed below. from the point of view of the ve dimensional

theory these indices are particular cases of supertrace formulas [7], which are invariant

under deformations of the theory.

1

2. setting the stage

we will consider black strings in 6d compactication of iib theory on t 4 and the

black holes in 5d compactications on t 5 obtained by wrapping these strings.

in this

section we summarize some standard facts about u -duality. see [8] for background.

the low energy theory of iib on t 5 is given by the 32-supercharge supergravity

supermultiplet. this has 27 gauge elds and 42 scalars. the scalar moduli space is
e6,6(ir)/u sp(8). we will work in a regime of moduli space where t 5 = s1  t 4 is
metrically a product with a large radius for the s1. moreover, we assume there are no
wilson lines (of 6d gauge elds) along the s1. this submanifold of moduli space is

described by the moduli of 6d compactication

(cid:2)o(5, 5; ir)/(o(5)  o(5))(cid:3)  ir+

(2.1)

where the last factor is the radius of the large s1. a subgroup of the u -duality group

preserving this submanifold is o(5, 5; zz) (not to be confused with the narain duality

group in 5d).

in 5d there are particles charged under the 27 gauge elds. their charges form the
zz27 representation of e6,6(zz). since the u -duality symmetry is broken to o(5, 5; zz) along
(2.1) the 5d particle charges accordingly decompose as the representation:

zz27  ii 5,5  zz16  zz

(2.2)

of o(5, 5; zz). these representations have the following interpretations. the lattice ii 5,5 is
the electric/magnetic charge lattice of 6d strings. the representation zz16 corresponds to

the 6d charges of particles. finally, the singlet zz is the momentum along the large circle.

we will denote a 5d charge vector in this decomposition as  = (s; p ; n ).

we are interested in charged black holes arising from wrappings of 6d strings on the
large s1, and in their bps excitations. in the following sections we will count these bps

excitations using a mapping to instanton moduli space sigma models. we will then verify

that this counting is invariant under a certain subgroup of the u -duality group e6,6(zz).
to explain this subgroup we need to understand the physics of the three summands in

(2.2).

the rst summand is the charge lattice of 6d strings (general considerations show

it is a lattice, i.e., has a symmetric nondegenerate bilinear form [9]). we can write
ii 5,5 = heven(t 4)  ii 1,1. corresponding to the decomposition in terms of d-branes

2

and (fundamental strings, wrapped ns5 branes), respectively. we can further decompose
heven(t 4) = (h0  h4)  h2 = ii 1,1  ii 3,3 corresponding to a natural basis of d1 strings
parallel to the large s1, wrapped d5 branes, and wrapped d3-branes, respectively.

the particle charges p in 6d form the spinor representation zz16 of o(5, 5; zz). writing
the decomposition under the o(4, 4; zz) narain subgroup this decomposes as zz16 = ii 4,4 
hodd(t 4; zz), corresponding to momentum, fundamental string winding, and wrapping of
d1, d3 branes. in this paper we often take p = 0.

now let us consider u -duality. let us rst assume the string charge s  ii 5,5 is a

primitive vector. it is then a standard result of lattice theory (see, e.g. [10], theorem 1.1.2
or theorem 1.14.4) that all primitive vectors s  ii 5,5 of a given length are equivalent

under o(5, 5; zz). since [10] uses some heavy machinery it is worth giving the following
elementary example of this phenomenon. we may identify the lattice ii 2,2 with the set

of integral 2  2 matrices. the signature (2, 2) quadratic form is simply the determinant.

the o(2, 2; zz) automorphism group acts by left- and right-multiplication by sl(2, zz):

m :=(cid:18) a b

d(cid:19)  al(cid:18) a b

c

d(cid:19) ar

c

(2.3)

now, using the standard fact that if gcd(a, b) = 1 then there exist p, q with ap + bq = 1, it

is easy to show that m can be bidiagonalized over sl(2, zz)  sl(2, zz) to smith normal

form:

m =(cid:18) n1

0

0

n1n2(cid:19)

(2.4)

thus, if m is primitive then the only invariant is the determinant, i.e., the norm-square.
in a similar way, if s  ii 5,5 is primitive we can, without loss of generality, put it in the
form s = (q1, q5)  ~0  (0, 0) with gcd(q1, q5) = 1 (these are the cases for which there
is a sigma model description). in other words, we can map any general string charge into

a d1-d5 system. we then simply write s = (q1, q5) and henceforth consider the charge

vectors

 = (q1, q5; p ; n ).

(2.5)

charge vectors of the form (2.5) are special because states with these charges can be

described using an instanton sigma model as in the original discussion of [1]. it follows

that invariance of physical quantities under u -duality transformations which preserve the

form (2.5) can lead to nontrivial predictions for the instanton sigma model. for simplicity

3

we will henceforth consider only those charges  which can be mapped to the standard
3-charge system  = (q1, q5;~0; n ) of [1]. 1

the u -duality transformations preserving the 3-charge system  = (q1, q5;~0; n ) form

a subgroup

(zz2  zz2)  s3  e6,6(zz).

this group is generated by 3 transformations:

r : (q1, q5;~0; n )  (q1, q5;~0; n )

t : (q1, q5;~0; n )  (q5, q1;~0; n )

t  :(q1, q5;~0; n )  (n, q5;~0; q1)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

the transformation r is simply a rotation by  and is certainly an invariance of the

sigma-model. also, t is an order two element of the narain duality group o(4, 4; zz)

corresponding to t -duality in all four directions. this is supposed to be a symmetry of

the conformal eld theory on the instanton moduli space. however t  is not an invariance

of the instanton sigma model. this is an sts type transformation in 5d which is not in

o(5, 5; zz). thus, the nontrivial predictions of e6,6(zz) u -duality for the instanton sigma

model are reduced to checking invariance under (2.9). this is what we will check below

for degeneracies of bps states, when q1, q5 are relatively prime.

1 whether an arbitrary charge  can be so mapped is a subtle arithmetic question, but the

answer is probably that every charge vector is equivalent to a 3-charge system, at least if the cubic

invariant is nonzero. the strategy for showing this is the following (we have not carried out all

the details). using the description of [11] this is equivalent to diagonalizability of 3  3 hermitian

matrices over the integral split octonions eozz using e6,6(zz) transformations. it is straightforward

to show that for any  there is in fact a 3-charge system  such that  =  p-adically for all p.

using some facts about the topology of f4,4 and a result from number theory called the strong

approximation theorem, the necessary hasse-minkowski local  global principle can be justied,

so the matrix can in fact be diagonalized over zz. we thank b. gross for very helpful comments

on this problem.

4

3. the instanton sigma model and its superconformal symmetry

now we consider the standard d1d5 system as an eective string in the 05 direction.

for the present purposes we will approximate the cft for the low energy excitations of

the theory on the string by a supersymmetric sigma model [3][1]:

(cid:2)ir4  t 4(cid:3)  (cid:2)hilbk(t 4)(cid:3).

(3.1)

here (x) denotes a supersymmetric sigma model with target space x, and k = q1q5.

the factor (cid:2)ir4 t 4(cid:3) is the free sigma model from the diagonal u (1) factor in the u (q1)

u (q5) gauge symmetry. the other degrees of freedom come from the hypermultiplets of
interacting d1d5 degrees of freedom. their target space is approximated by hilbk(t 4),
the hilbert scheme of k points on t 4. this is a smooth resolution of the singular orbifold
symk(t 4), and is endowed with a smooth hyperkahler metric.

it is important to realize that the innocent-looking (3.1) has several subtleties. first of

all, there should be an orbifold by certain translation symmetries. because of a restriction

to a charge zero sector, described below, this can be ignored. furthermore, we will be

working at a point in moduli space where the d1 branes cannot leave the vebranes. at

some special points in moduli space, for example when all b-elds are zero, the d1 branes

can leave the system and the cft becomes singular.

the symmetries of the cft can be deduced from standard dbrane technology. we
assume the d1 string is in the 05 direction and the d5 wraps the t 4 and is in the 056789

direction. the spinors, which initially transform in the 16+ of the ten dimensional lorentz
group now transform under

spin(1, 1)05 (cid:2)su (2)+  su (2)(cid:3)1234 (cid:2)su (2)+  su (2)(cid:3)6789.

(3.2)

note that the last factor is not really a full symmetry of the cft since we are on t 4, but

it is useful to classify spinors. the ten-dimensional supersymmetries are in the 16+ but
only those invariant under su (2)
6789 survive, i.e. only the ones with positive chirality in

the 051234 directions. thus the unbroken supersymmetry is in the representation

(3.3)

in 1+1 dimensions  1

2 chiralities correspond to left and right movers, so we see that we
get (4,4) supersymmetry. we also see that spacetime rotations in the directions 1234 act

5

as r-symmetries of this conformal eld theory. since we have 8 supersymmetries we can

denote the two possible multiplets as vectors and hypers. from the center-of-mass (com)
cft (ir4  t 4) we get a vector and a hyper. the vector describes motion in ir4 and the
hyper describes motion in t 4.

the left-moving part of the vector multiplet transforms as:

x  (0; 2, 2; 1, 1)

  (+

2

; 1, 2; 2, 1)

(3.4)

and similarly for the right-moving part exchanging the su (2)1234 factors from (3.2).

x  (0; 1, 1; 2, 2)

(3.5)

(3.6)

the full cft (3.1) has a global su (2)+
1234 symmetry corresponding to space-
time rotations. this is the massive little group of particles in 5d and will be used below to

1234  su (2)

enumerate bps representations. the quantum numbers of the elds under this symmetry
follow from (3.4)(3.5)(3.6). note that for the ir4 factor the bosons transform under the
global symmetry. note also that all hypermultiplets (3.5)(3.6) transform in the same way
under so(1, 1)  su (2)+
1234 and in a dierent way from the vector multiplets
(3.4). this dierence is what distinguishes a vectormultiplet from a hypermultiplet in 1+1

1234  su (2)

dimensions.

for the t 4 and symk(t 4) factors the su (2)+

1234 are zeromodes of left and
right-moving su (2) current algebras of level k which are part of the left- and right-moving

1234  su (2)

n = 4 superconformal algebra. in fact, in the example of toroidal compactication there
is a larger superconformal algebra. this arises because there is a u (1)4 current algebra

which commutes with the su (2)k, and can be understood as follows. the unsymmetrized
product of k copies of t 4 has four currents which generate simultaneous translation along
the four axes of all k copies of t 4. these four currents are permutation invariant and

6

therefore descend to four u (1) currents in the orbifold theory on symk(t 4). the resolved
conformal eld theory on hilbk(t 4) is determined by twenty parameters (= 4h1,1) which

determine the complex structure, kahler class and b-elds [12] . sixteen of these are

essentially associated to each t 4 and the last four are involved in blowing up the orbifold

points. the values of these 20 parameters are invariant under the u (1)4 action. therefore,
the u (1)4 current algebra survives the resolution of symk(t 4) to hilbk(t 4).

put more geometrically, the resolution p : hilbk(t 4)  symk(t 4) only depends on

local data (such as the direction along which points approach each other at the orbifold loci)
so the obvious translation symmetry of symk(t 4) lifts to an action of u (1)4 on hilbk(t 4).

u (1)4 can be regarded as the    limit of su (2)  u (1). since the large n = 4
current algebra is su (2)  su (2)  u (1), we conclude that hilbk(t 4) conformal eld
theory has a degenerate large n = 4 algebra, a,. (in the following we will sometimes

abuse language and refer to a, as a large n = 4 algebra.)

in the study of 5d black holes in s1  k3 compactications a key role was played by

the elliptic genus for n = 2 conformal eld theories dened by [13]

e := tr[(1)2j 3

0 2 j 3

0 ql0 q

l0 y2j 3
0 ],

(3.7)

where j 3

0 and j 3

0 are the half-integral left and right u (1) charges. here and henceforth we
normalize l0 so that the ramond ground states have l0 = 0. the elliptic genus e is a

useful object because it is invariant under all smooth deformations of the theory. the trace

is taken in the rr sector of the conformal eld theory. of course, it can also be dened

for n = 4 theories by embedding the u (1) charges in su (2). but in theories having large

n = 4 symmetry it is not useful because it always vanishes. we will now show that the

modied partition function

e2 := tr[(1)2j 3

0 2 j 3

0 (2 j 3

0 )2ql0 q

l0 y2j 3
0 ],

(3.8)

is an analogous topological invariant for theories with the large n = 4 symmetry.(note that
e1 = 0, and indeed, tr(j 3
0 )n = 0 in any su (2) representation, for n odd.) this amounts
to showing that the massive representations of this degenerate large n = 4 algebra do

not contribute to e2. consider the subalgebra generated by the ramond-sector zero mode

(3.9)

the rest of the commutators, including those of gs with qs, vanish if we consider states
neutral with respect to u (1)4, i.e. with no momentum or winding on t 4. the general case

will be discussed momentarily.

for a massive representation, by denition l0 > 0. this implies that the commutation

i which we choose to have j 3

relations of the gs and qs are those of fermionic creation and annihilation operators. we
have four creation operators b
0 = 1/2. the annihilation
operators then have j 3
0 = 1/2. let |0, ji denote the state that is annihilated by all the
annihilation operators and obeys j 3
0 |0, ji = j|0, ji for some j. acting with the creation
0 = j + 1/2, six states with j 3
operators we get four states with j 3
0 = j + 1, four with
j 3
0 = j + 3/2 and one with j 3
0 = j + 2. the fermion numbers of these states alternate. it is
easy to check that the traces over this zero mode representation trj(1)f = trj(1)2j 3
as well as trj(1)2j 3

0 vanish. one also nds by direct computation

we conclude the massive representations do not contribute to e2.

carrying additional charges. in this paper, however, we concentrate on the case where all

this is the case when l0 >p4

these charges are zero.

for non-degenerate large n = 4 algebras a, with nite su (2) levels  and , the
commutators of g0 and q0 have su (2)  su (2) current algebra zero modes on the
right hand side. this complicates the preceding argument. however in this case one may

conclude from direct examination of formulae in [14] that the massive characters do not
contribute to e2. this implies that the index (3.8) will be useful to analyze the conformal
eld theory related to ads3  s3  s3  s1 [15]. in fact it would be very interesting to
compute the supergravity result since it could teach us something about the dual conformal

eld theory.

as we shall see shortly, the massless characters with l0 = 0 do contribute to e2.
this contribution is independent of the continuous parameters describing the resolution of
symk(t 4) to hilbk(t 4). hence we can compute e2 for all cases from the limiting case of
symk(t 4).

4. counting spacetime bps multiplets

in this section we explain the spacetime interpretation of (3.8). the d1d5 system
on s1  t 4 and its excitations describe particles in 5 dimensions. these all transform in
representations of the 5d poincare supersymmetry algebra with 32 real supercharges. the

dierent representations can be characterized by the spin(4)1234 characters

(y, y) := trhlittle (1)fspacetimey2j 3

0 y2 j 3

0

(4.1)

of the representation of the little superalgebra. the long representations built with 32

active (i.e. broken) supercharges have character

0/32(y, y) = jl (y)jr(y)(y1/2  y1/2)8(y1/2  y1/2)8.

(4.2)

here the subscript indicates the number of preserved supercharges, (jl, jr) are arbitrary
half-integral spins, and

j(y) = y2j + y2j+2 +    + y2j =

y2j+1  y2j1

y  y1

.

(4.3)

9

the bps states we will encounter in the d1d5 system come in three kinds of short

representations:

a. m = z1. m 6= |zi|, i > 1, where zi are the skew eigenvalues of the central charge

matrix. the characters are

+
4/32 = jl (y)jr(y)(y1/2  y1/2)8(y1/2  y1/2)6

b. if instead m = z1 we get


4/32 = jl (y)jr(y)(y1/2  y1/2)6(y1/2  y1/2)8

c. finally, a shorter representation has character

(4.4)

(4.5)

8/32 = jl(y)jr(y)(y1/2  y1/2)6(y1/2  y1/2)6.

(4.6)

u-duals of massive dabholkar-harvey states turn out to be in representations of type c.

there are also other bps states in other representations for example 1/2 bps states, etc.

we now discuss how these characters show up in cft partition functions. in general

for the cft (x) we denote

z(x) = z(q, y, q, y) := trrr(1)2j 3

l0 y2j 3

0 y2 j 3

0

0 2 j 3

0 ql0 q

(4.7)

for the conformal eld theory (3.1) this trace is a product3 of two factors: one for the com
degrees of freedom and one for the cft (hilbk(t 4)). the rst factor can be computed
straightforwardly in terms of oscillators using the quantum numbers (3.4)(3.5)(3.6). we

will discuss the second factor in section ve.

the trace (4.7) for the cft (3.1) can be decomposed in terms of the characters of

the massive little superalgebra:

8/32(y, y)d8/32(q1, q5; jl, jr)

+

z(q, y, q, y) = xjl,jr
xn=1 xjl,jr

10

where (, ) run over the massive spectrum of the cft (3.1).

in (4.8) the ds measure the degeneracies of various types of representations of

the spacetime d = 5, n = 4 superalgebra.

in particular, d8/32(q1, q5; jl, jr) is
the number of bps multiplets of charge (q1, q5, n = 0) in the representation (4.6).
d+
4/32(q1, q5, n ; jl, jr) is the number of bps multiplets of charge (q1, q5, n > 0) in
the representation (4.4). these are macroscopically black holes with positive horizon area,

etc.

note that part of the structure of (4.8) as a function of y, y follows from the represen-

tation theory of the algebra a,. from the com sigma model we have an overall factor of
(y1/2y1/2)4(y1/2y1/2)4. then, in the symk(t 4) sigma model we have tr(1)f f  = 0
for  = 0, 1 and therefore there is an extra factor of (y1/2  y1/2)2(y1/2  y1/2)2 coming

from this piece. for massive reps  > 0 of a, we showed in section three that in fact
tr(1)f f  = 0 for  = 0, 1, 2, 3 and therefore reps with  > 0,  = 0 give a factor of
(y1/2  y1/2)4(y1/2  y1/2)2, etc.

in order to give a counting formula for bps multiplets we should take a derivative of
at y = 1. from the cft of the sigma model (ir4  t 4)  (symk(t 4))

(4.8) by 1

we need 4 derivatives to act on the com part of the sigma model and 2 derivatives to act
on the sk(t 4) part. there is a surprising cancellation of the com contributions from ir4
and t 4 after setting y = 1 and the d1d5 cft gives simply:

5. computation of e=2

in this section we evaluate e2 more explicitly. in [16] a general formula was derived

relating the partition function for a conformal eld theory with target x to that of a

11

conformal eld theory whose target is the orbifold symk(x). the partition function for a
single copy of x denes the degeneracies c(, , , ) via:

z(cid:0)x(cid:1) = x, ,,

c(, , , )q q

.
y y

(5.1)

here the trace is in the rr sector. the spectrum of u (1) charges ,  is integer or half-
integer, according to the parity of the complex dimension of x and ,  runs over the
spectrum of l0, l0. the values of ,  are in general arbitrary nonnegative real numbers,
although the dierence    is integral.

in terms of c, the partition function over symk(x) may be derived using a small

modication of the discussion in [16], and is:

z(p, q, q, y, y) :=

xk=0

pkz(cid:0)symk(x)(cid:1) =

integer.

we now specialize to a target space such that z(x)|y=1 = z(x)|y=1 = 0 (as, for

example, in the case x = t 4 due to fermion zero modes.). thus we have

c(, , , ) = 0

c(, , , ) = 0

x
x

(5.3)

moreover, we assume that the conformal eld theory for x has a realization of the super-
conformal algebra a, or its    contraction. in this case we may use the results of
the previous section to obtain the identity

2c(, , , ) = 0

for

 > 0

(5.4)

x

(recall that we are taking the u (1) charges to be zero.)

let us now compute z . it follows from (5.3) that z in (5.2) is equal to one for y = 1.

dierentiating with respect to y gives

yz = xn,, ,,

if we set y = 1 we get zero by (5.3). next we compute the second derivative of (5.2)

with respect to y and set y = 1. if the second derivative acts on the z factor in (5.5) the

result vanishes when we set y = 1. so the second derivative must act on the sum in (5.5).
after setting y = 1 one nds that the sum over  drops out, since only the  = 0 term
contributes by (5.4). this implies that  is integral and divisible by n:  = nm with

m = 0, 1, 2   . so we get

(5.9)

we stress that this formula is only applicable for gcd(q1, q5) = 1 (i.e., for a primitive
vector in the string charge lattice) because otherwise the possibility of bound states at
threshold obscures the relationship between the sigma model and the d1d5 system.5

let us now specialize to the particular example of x = t 4. the partition function

(5.1) becomes

4 the counting of d8/32 nicely matches the known degeneracies of dabholkar-harvey states
[2][3]. this can be shown in the present context using the result of [17], (equation (7.6) below).
5 thus this is the formula for the bps degeneracies only for a fraction, 6/2, of the cases (6/2

is the probability that two integers are relatively prime). we will remedy this below.

13

here 4,4 is a lattice of zeromodes. we will be interested in states with zero u (1) charges
and as we discussed above this implies that only states with l0 = 0 will contribute to the
index we will be computing. this implies that pr = 0 for each copy of the symmetric
product of t 4s. for generic values of the t 4 moduli this implies that also pl = 0. if we
go to the particular values where we have additional values of pl allowed we see that they
should appear in pairs so that their contribution to the index cancels. we will therefore

drop the lattice sum in (5.10).

taking explicit derivatives and using the product formula:

1(z| ) = i(y1/2  y1/2)q1/8

yn=1

(1  qn)(1  yqn)(1  y1qn)

(5.11)

with y = e2iz gives:

 !2
  1(z| )

1

4 =x c(n, )qny

(5.12)

the left hand side is a weak jacobi form of weight 2 and index 1. therefore, the
coecients c(n, ) are actually functions of only one variable c(n, ) = c(4n  2) [18].

(this can also be seen by bosonizing the u(1) current.) using the sum formula

1(z| ) = iq1/8(y1/2  y1/2)

xn=0

qn(n+1)/2(1)nj=n(y1/2)

(5.13)

and j=n(y1/2) = j=n/2(y) + j=(n1)/2(y) (valid for n > 0 and integral) and expanding
one easily derives explicit formulae for the expansion coecients:

x c(n, )qny = (y1/2  y1/2)2"1  2(y1/2  y1/2)2q
 (y1/2  y1/2)2(240  81/2)q3 +   #

(y1/2  y1/2)2(80  1/2)q2

(5.14)

note that the positive powers of q have an extra factor of (y1/2  y1/2)2, and that
(y1/2  y1/2)2 = 1/2  20 allowing a decomposition into su (2) characters.

finally, let us close with two remarks.

1. first, the expression z  in (5.6) can be interpreted more geometrically. recall that
there is an action of t 4 on hilbk(t 4) lifting the action by translation on symk(t 4).

14

the quotient space ghilbk(t 4) := hilbk(t 4)/t 4 is a simply connected irreducible hy-

perkahler manifold. 6 working in the charge zero sector the partition function fac-

torizes:

for k  1. therefore,

z(hilbk(t 4)) = z(t 4)z( ghilbk(t 4))

(cid:18) xk=1

pkz( ghilbk(t 4))(cid:19)|y=1 = lim

y1

z(p, q, q, y, y)  1

z(t 4)

= 

1
2

6
2
1

z 

(5.15)

(5.16)

so z  is essentially just the generating function for elliptic genera of the hyperkahler

spaces ghilbk(t 4).

2. second, similar multiplet counting formulae apply to compactications on s1  k3.

in this case, k3 breaks half of the supersymmetries, the bps multiplets are smaller,
the sigma model is now (ir4)  (symk(k3)) and the analog of (5.9) is obtained by
taking 1

d2
dy2 |y=1 to get:

(y1/2  y1/2)2 xjl,jr

we see that in this case the center of mass sigma model contributes to the index for

spacetime bps states.

(5.17)

6. u -duality and the long string interpretation

u -duality has interesting implications in connection with the long-string picture of

[20]. the six dimensional o(5, 5; zz) u -duality group does not transform n , but, as men-

tioned above can be used to put the string charge s in a canonical form, which we take

6 see, e.g.

[19], and references therein. we thank n. seiberg and e. witten for discussions

about this space.

15

to be s = (q1q5, 1). by a permutation like (2.9) we can then map to s = (q1q5, n ).
then, if n and q1q5 are relatively prime we can again use u -duality to map to a charge
vector of the form  = (1, 1;~0; q1q5n ). this state is just a single d1 and a single d5 with
momentum n  = q1q5n , and its degeneracy is the same as that of a single long string.
this implies that if we think in terms of strings in the vebrane [4], only the long string

contributes and all other contributions cancel. it can be seen from (5.9) that indeed in

this case only the term with s = 1 contributes to (5.9).

this description in terms of a long string applies when we take n to be coprime with

q1q5. however, given k = q1q5 we should consider all possible values of n and the
structure of the hilbert space is of the form:

h(symkx) = {kr} r>0 symkr (hr(x))

(6.1)

wherep rkr = k, and hr(x) is the single string hilbert space for a string of length r. the

sectors which contribute to z  are of the form r|ksymk/r(hr(x))     and correspond
to collections of strings of a single length k/r.

6.1. a formula for all primitive vectors

in this section we extend the counting formula from the case gcd(q1, q5) = 1 to all

primitive vectors equivalent to the three charge system.

u -duality under the transformation t (2.8) is obvious. to check u-duality under t 

we should remember that our formula is valid only if gcd(q1, q5) = 1, therefore we can
compute the right hand side of (2.9) only if gcd(n, q5) = 1 as well. in that case it is easy
to see that the sum over s is such that the two results agree. if one drops the restriction

gcd(q1, q5) = 1 then (5.9) is not u -duality invariant. as a simple example, let p1, p2 be
1p2, )

two distinct primes. then  = (p1, p1; 0; p2) on the rhs of (5.9) gives p yc(p2
while  = (p2, p1; 0; p1) givesp yc(p2

1p2, ) +p p1yp1 c(p1p2, ).

to cure this problem we begin by noting that, in close analogy to the remark of [16],

the expression on the rhs of (5.9) is just a transform by a hecke operator vq1q5 applied to
a jacobi form [18]. 7 since vq1q5 = vq1 vq5 for q1, q5 relatively prime one might wonder

7 the power of s in (5.9) is nonstandard. a weight = k form would have a power of sk1. in
our case, c(n, ) are coecients of a weight k = 2 form, but the power of s in (5.9) corresponds

to a weight k = +2 form. we do not understand this peculiarity very well, but it does not aect

the following argument.

16

if the general formula is given by vq1 vq5.

indeed, this guess has some very attractive

features. following [18], pp. 44-45 one can write (for any q1, q5, not necessarily relatively

prime):

(vq1 vq5 c)(n, ) =xs

n (s) s c(

n q1q5

s2

,


s

)

where n (s) is the number of integral divisors  of

n, q1, q5, s,

n q1

s

,

n q5

s

,

q1q5

s

,

n q1q5

s2

(6.2)

(6.3)

it follows that vq1 vq5 = vq5 vq1 and, more importantly, that (6.2) is completely symmetric

in q1, q5, n . thus, this is a natural u -duality invariant ansatz for the general case. indeed,

it is the unique u -duality invariant extension to primitive 3-charge systems.

7. comparison to supergravity

in this section we compute e2 by summing over multiparticle supergravity excitations
of ads3  s3  t 4 and using the ads/cft correspondence [21]. a similar comparison
with the elliptic genus for the k3 case was made by de boer [22].

the supergravity computation is in the ns sector while the cft partition function is

normally calculated in the r sector. under spectral ow between the sectors a state with

weight hr and (half-integer) u(1) charge jr is mapped into a state with weights

hns =

k
4

+ hr + jr

jns = jr +

k
2

(7.1)

where k = c/6 (c = 6q1q5 is the central charge of the cft). we use a convention such

that hns = k/4 for the ns vacuum. the partition function in the ns sector can be

obtained from the partition function in the r sector by the following replacements

p  pq1/4y ,

q  q ,

y  yq1/2

(7.2)

in principle one expects agreement with supergravity only for small conformal weights,

not much bigger than the ns vacuum hns = k/4. when conformal weights are of order

k the stringy exclusion principle [23] is relevant and supergravity breaks down. we shall

in fact nd agreement for all negative values of hns , k/4  hns < 0.

17

for the cft we start from (5.8) in the rr sector and we nd the ns-ns partition

function

1
2

z 

ns = xn,m,l,s

c(4nm  l2)s(cid:16)pnqn/4+m+l/2yn+l(cid:17)s

.

(7.3)

now we concentrate on the terms in this expansion with negative powers of q, relevant

for the comparison to supergravity. the only possibility is n = 1, m = 0, l = 1, since

c(r) = 0 for r < 1. using c(1) = 1, c(0) = 2 this gives

1
2

z 

ns =xs

s(pq1/4)s + . . .

(7.4)

where the dots involve non-negative powers of q.

now we consider the supergravity calculation. we need to dene an appropriate

notion of a supergravity elliptic genus zsugra(p, q, y). we will follow the proposal of de
boer [22]. the single particle supergravity hilbert space can be derived by group theory

and kaluza-klein reduction. it decomposes as a representation of su (2|1, 1)  su (2|1, 1):

hsingle particle = j,j0nj,j (j)  (j)

(7.5)

short su (2|1, 1) reps are labelled by the maximal spin, i.e., a nonnegative half-integer j.

the highest weight has h = j. label it by (j). it turns out that single particle states

are always products of short representations. there is no analog of the long  short of

cft. (these latter come from multiparticle supergravity states.) it turns out that the

degeneracies in (7.5) can be read o from the identity of [17]

hr,r(skx)yr y r =

(1  (1)r+ryr+n1 y r+n1pn)(1)r+r hr,r(x)

(7.6)

pkxr,r

xk0
where h(x) = pr,r(1)r+rhr,ryr y r is the hodge polynomial. the generating function

(7.6) counts (c, c) primaries. each (c, c) primary in turn corresponds to a short su (2|1, 1)

yn=1yr,r

su (2|1, 1) representation. de boer [22] proposes to associate a new quantum number to

the supergravity states, the degree, in order to take into account the exclusion principle.

the degree is the power of p multiplying the various factors in (7.6). thus, representations

are now labelled by (r, r; d) where d is the degree. notice that this assignment of degree
breaks the so(4, 5) continuous u-duality symmetry of supergravity on ads3  s3  t 4.

with this innovation the single-particle hilbert space is:

hsingle particle = n0,r,rhr,r(x)(

1
2

(n + r),

1
2

(n + r); n + 1)

(7.7)

18

where hr,r(x) are the hodge numbers of x = k3, t 4. for the torus the hodge polynomial
factorizes as (1  y)2(1  y)2 so we can introduce the useful device for the torus hilbert

space:

hsingle particle = n0 r,r=0,1,2 d(r)d(r)(

1
2

(n + r),

1
2

(n + r); n + 1)

(7.8)

here d(0) = d(2) = 1, d(1) = 2 (the sign is for a fermionic representation). notice that

we are including the identity.

we now dene the supergravity elliptic genus as the free eld theory partition

function for the fock space built up from hsingle particle:

zsugra(p, q, q, y, y) := yhsingle particle

(1  pdq q

y y

)(1)+ 

(7.9)

(here it is more convenient to use  = 2j which is integral). since we will eventually set

y = 1 and expect only holomorphic quantities from left chiral primaries we will temporarily

suppress q. this is not totally innocent, and we will return to the q-dependence at the

end of this section. suppressing q, y, we can rewrite (7.9) as a product of factors (1 
pnqhy)cs(n,h,) where cs(n, h, ) is the number of single particle states with l0 = h, u (1)
charge =  and degree n. (as usual c < 0 for fermions). here we are measuring l0

relative to the ns vacuum, as is conventional in ads discussions. so in order to compare
with the above formulae we need to replace p  pq1/4. the eects of the exclusion

principle are approximated by truncating the supergravity spectrum to states with total

degree k = q1q5.

the full exclusion-principle-modied supergravity partition function is thus

zsugra = yn,h,

1

(1  pnqhn/4y)cs(n,h,)

(7.10)

of course, as written zsugra = 1 for t 4 at y = 1. we therefore need to put back y and take
derivatives to get a nontrivial quantity. the y that appears in the r partition function
diers from the one appearing in the ns partition function by a factor of q1/2 arising in
the spectral ow. so after dierentiating twice we set y = q1/2. this selects the chiral

primaries. manipulations similar to those in section ve then lead to

z 

sugra|y=q1/4 = xs,h,n,

cs(n, h, )s(pnqhn/4y)s

(7.11)

19

where cs(n, h, ) =p

given properties and the sum over  runs over all the chiral primaries of degree n.

2cs(n, h, , ) counts the number of right chiral primaries with the

next we need a good way to enumerate chiral primaries in this theory. using (7.8)
above we can perform the sum over 2 over chiral primaries of given degree. it is easy

to see that pr d(r) = 0, p d(r)(n + r) = 0 and pr d(r)(n + r)2 = 2. this nal sum is

independent of n and just gives an overall factor, as in the cft result. we now need to

compute c(n, h, ) just for the left-moving piece. ignoring for a moment the sum over s we

see that we have

x c(n, h, )pnqhn/4y = xn,k,r,t

d(r)d(t)pn+1q

n+2r+2t1

4

+k

n+rtx=n+rt

y

(7.12)

where r = 0, 1, 2 as above and t = 0, 1, 2 takes into account the descendants of the form
g1/2, etc. the sum over k takes into account the descendants of the form lk
1, k = 0, 1, 2.
the sum over  is in steps of 2. we have replaced p  pq1/4 to take into account the

ground state energy so that we can compare to (7.4). the sum over s is taken into account
by replacing (p, q, y)  (ps, qs, ys) multiplying by s and then summing over s. we are

interested in terms with negative powers of q. this requires

n  1

4

+

r + t

2

+ k < 0

(7.13)

the only possibility is k = r = t = n = 0, and this reproduces (7.4). hence the super-
gravity and cft calculations of z agree exactly for all negative powers of q. notice that

basically only the ground state is contributing to (7.4). so the agreement boils down to

the statement that all the gravity contributions cancel at low enough energies.

it is not hard to see that the agreement does not persist for nonnegative powers of q
(indeed, there is a discrepancy at order q0). this is not surprising because supergravity

becomes strongly coupled before this point.

indeed a black hole which is a left-chiral

primary appears at this level. this black hole is an extremal rotating black hole with
angular momentum on s3.

finally, let us return to the issue of the q dependence of z 

sugra. in fact if q is reinstated,
one nds at these excited levels dependence on positive powers of q. this might seem to

be a contradiction because we argued in section 3 that the large n = 4 algebra forbids q-
dependence of z. what happens is that the implementation of the exclusion principle as a

cuto on supergravity states breaks the large n = 4, which for example maps single particle

20

states below the cuto to multi-particle states above the cuto. hence this implementation,

while very successful at low energies, is too naive to describe the hilbert space at high
energies. indeed, the q dependence at order pn rst shows up at order qn/4. thus, in
the large n limit the action of the large n = 4 algebra is restored, in accord with the

ads/cft correspondence.

8. open questions

as we have stressed, (5.9) is false when q1, q5 have common factors, i.e., when the
mukai vector of the instanton moduli space is not primitive. this is not terribly surprising

since it is known that the moduli space is singular under such circumstances, and there are

even resolutions of the space not equivalent to the hilbert scheme of points [24]. physically,

nonprimitive vectors are associated with the possibility of boundstates at threshold so we

expect subtleties in counting bps states. very similar subtleties were found already in

the work of vafa and witten in [25]. in view of this one should be cautious about the
existing formulae for bps states in s1  k3 compactication for nonprimitive mukai
vectors. unfortunately, u -duality is not a useful tool for probing this question.

in (6.2)(6.3) we extended (5.9) to all primitive 3-charge systems, but this leaves open

the question of what the degeneracies really are when  is not primitive. because of

bound-states at threshold this question requires careful denition. one way to approach

this question is to use the trick in [2], compactifying on another circle and turning on a

charge to remove the boundstates at threshold.

the results of this paper raise some interesting open problems. it is natural to expect

that the full set of bps states for toroidally compactied type ii string is counted by some

interesting automorphic functions transforming nontrivially under ed,d(zz). one might
hope that such forms might appear in quantum corrections along the lines of the bps

counting formulae appearing in quantum corrections. (see [8], p.10 for a list of references.)

at present such automorphic forms remain part of the great unkown.

finally it would be interesting to compute this index for supergravity on ads3  s3 

s3  s1 [15] in order to see what we can learn about the conformal eld theory.
