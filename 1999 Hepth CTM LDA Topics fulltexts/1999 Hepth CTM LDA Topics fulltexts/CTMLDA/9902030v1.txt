solutions to the reection equation

and integrable systems

for n=2 sqcd with classical groups

a.gorsky, a.mironov

integrable systems underlying the seiberg-witten solutions for the n = 2 sqcd
with gauge groups so(n) and sp(n) are proposed. they are described by the
inhomogeneous xxx spin chain with specic boundary conditions given by reec-
tion matrices. we attribute reection matrices to orientifold planes in the brane
construction and briey discuss its possible deformations.

introductory remarks. since n.seiberg and e.witten proposed their anzatz [1] for
solving n = 2 susy gauge theories, there have been a lot of attempts to realize the structures
behind it, in order to get any kind of understanding and, after all, derivation. in particular,
one of the important structures that underlines the seiberg-witten (sw) anzatz and reects
its symmetry properties is integrability [2]. concretely, in [2] it has been shown that the sw
solution of the pure gauge n=2 susy theories with su(nc) gauge group can be described in
the framework of the periodic toda chain with nc sites.

since then, there have been a lot of dierent examples of the correspondence (sw solution
 integrable system) considered [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. the list of examples includes 4d, 5d and
6d theories with matter hypermultiplets in adjoint or fundamental representations included.
however, all the examples from this extensive list mainly dealt with the su(nc) group. not
much has been known of other groups up to the recent time.
in fact, the rst paper dealt
with integrable structures for other classical groups was [3]. the authors of [3] considered the
pure gauge theory with gauge group g that is one of the classical groups so(n) or sp(n) and
demonstrated that the corresponding sw anzatz can be described by the toda chain associated

with the root system of the dual ane algebra bg  (one should also specically match the rank

of this algebra, see below).

this result has been recently generalized to the theories with adjoint matter, which are
described by the elliptic calogero-moser model [6]. for these systems, lax representation with
the spectral parameter has been constructed for the classical groups other than su(nc) in
[10] (and the proper brane picture has been suggested in [11, 12]). however, including the
fundamental matter for all thee classical groups has remained a problem. indeed, the theories

of such a type are described by spin chains that generalize the dierent (i.e. of non-calogero
type), 2  2 lax representation of the toda chain [4, 8]. this representation is related to the
root system not immediately being rather a building block of the nal answer associated with
some dynkin diagram. the whole construction also requires some specic boundary conditions
typically given by reection matrices that solve the so called reection equation [13]. on the
other hand, introducing the boundary conditions and the corresponding reection matrices is
the only new thing as compared with the su(nc) case. demonstration of this fact is the main
purpose of the present paper. we will show that the sw solutions for theories with fundamental
matter are always (for any classical group) governed by the inhomogeneous xxx chain so that
the group is encoded completely in the boundary conditions (that can be read o immediately
from the corresponding dynkin diagram).

there is an alternative way to deal with susy gauge theories  that is, to use the brane
pictures [14]. such pictures for the theories with all classical groups and fundamental matter
have been known for a while. in particular, for description of the theories with orthogonal and
symplectic gauge groups, one needs, besides branes to introduce an orientifold [15]. however,
so far there has not been presented any integrable system for the theories with orientifold. as
we show in the paper, this is just the reection matrix to be introduced into the spin chain,
that is equivalent to adding the orientifold to the brane system. we discuss the correspondence
of the spin chain and the brane picture at the end of the paper.

pure gauge su (nc) theory. we begin with discussing the standard construction of
the sw anzatz for the pure gauge su(nc) theory within the integrable framework [2]. the
most important result of [1], from this point of view, is that the moduli space of vacua and low
energy eective action in sym theories are completely given by the following input data:

 riemann surface c

 moduli space m (of the curves c)

 meromorphic 1-form ds on c

now we describe how this data can be obtained from an integrable system. we start with
the periodic toda chain which describes the pure gauge su(nc) theory. the periodic toda
chain of length nc is given by the 2  2 lax matrices

li =

 + pi eqi
eqi

0 

the linear problem in the toda chain has the following form

li()i() = i+1()

(1)

(2)

where i() is the two-component baker-akhiezer function.

one also needs to consider proper boundary conditions. these are periodic boundary con-
ditions in the su(nc) case. the periodic boundary conditions are easily formulated in terms
of the baker-akhiezer function and read as

i+nc() = wi()

(3)

where w is a free parameter (diagonal matrix). the toda chain with these boundary conditions
can be naturally associated with the dynkin diagram of the group a(1)

nc1, see fig.1.

fig.1 dynkin diagram for a(1)
n

one can introduce the transfer matrix shifting i to i + nc

t ()  lnc() . . . l1()

now the periodic boundary conditions are encapsulated in the spectral curve equation

det(t ()  w  1) = 0

(4)

(5)

the transfer matrix generates a complete set of integrals of motion. note that the riemann
surface c of the sw data is nothing but the spectral curve.

integrability of the toda chain follows from quadratic r-matrix relations (see, e.g. [16])

{li() , lj()} = ij [r(  ), li()  li()]

with the rational r-matrix

r() =

where a are the standard pauli matrices.

1


3xa=1

a  a

(6)

(7)

the crucial property of this relation is that it is multiplicative and any product like (4)

satises the same relation

{t () , t ()} = [r(  ), t ()  t ()]

(8)

and, therefore, traces of the transfer matrices given at dierent  are commuting giving rise to
a series of conservation laws (= hamiltonians).

the spectral curve (5) can be presented in more explicit terms:

w2  trt ()w + 1 = 0

(9)

since det t () = 1. transfer matrix trt ()  p () yields hamiltonians (integrals of motion)
parametrizing the moduli space m of the spectral curves, i.e.
the moduli space of vacua
of physical theory. the replace y  w  1/w transforms the curve (16) to the standard
hyperelliptic form y 2 = p 2  4, the genus of the curve being nc  1.

as to the meromorphic 1-form, the remaining ingredient of the sw anzatz, it is given by
ds =  dw
y and is just the shorten action pdq along the non-contractible contours on
the complex lagrangian tori. its dening property is that the derivatives of ds with respect to
the moduli (ramication points) are holomorphic dierentials on the spectral curve.

w =  dp

note that the toda chain which has two dierent lax representations. indeed, the system
can be reformulated in terms of nc  nc matrix. to this end, consider the two-component

baker-akhiezer function n =  n

n !. then the linear problem (2) can be rewritten as

n+1  pnn + eqnqn1n1 = n,

n = eqn1n1

(10)

and, along with the periodic boundary conditions (3) reduces to the linear problem l(w) = 
for the n  n lax operator

l(w) =

(12)

which is still equivalent to the spectral curve (5).

including fundamental matter.
in order to include matter hypermultiplets, one
needs to consider an integrable system which generalizes the toda chain. one may generalize
both nc  nc and 2  2 lax representations. the generalization of the former one is well known
to be the elliptic calogero model [6]. in turn, now it is also known how to extend this system
to other classical groups [10].

at the same time, in order to include the fundamental matter, one has to generalize the
2  2 representation of the toda chain. this generalization is the inhomogeneous xxx chain
[4, 8]. the xxx spin chain is given by the lax operator

li() = ( + i)  1 +

3xa=1

sa,i  a =

 + i + s0,i

s+,i

s,i

 + i  s0,i



(13)

here is are inhomogeneities , which can be introduced since the poisson brackets (6) depends
only on dierence of the spectral parameters. the lax operator (13) restores the symmetry
along the diagonal since has non-zero second diagonal entry linear in the spectral parameter.
the lax operator satises the poisson algebra (6) with the same rational r-matrix (7).

the poisson brackets of the dynamical variables sa, a = 1, 2, 3 (taking values in the algebra

of functions) are implied by (6) and are just

{sa, sb} = iabcsc

(14)

i.e. {sa} plays the role of angular momentum (classical spin) giving the name spin-chains
to the whole class of systems. algebra (14) has an obvious casimir function (an invariant,
which poisson commutes with all the spins sa),

(cid:16)c (2)(cid:17)2

= s2 =

3xa=1

sasa

(15)

for the spin chain, the linear problem remains the same (2) as well as the boundary con-
ditions (3). this means that this spin chain is also associated with the dynkin diagram of the
group a(1)

nc1. the spectral curve now is of the general form

w2  trt ()w + det t () = w2  p ()w + q() = 0

(16)

4

which also gets manifestly hyperelliptic (of the same genus nc  1) upon the replace y 
w  q/w:

y 2 = p 2  4q

(17)

the sw meromorphic 1-form also remains unchanged ds =  dw

w =  dp
y .

one can also dene masses of the hypermultiplets immediately from the spectral curve.

they are just zeroes of the determinant of the transfer matrix. since

det
22

li() = ( + i)2 (cid:16)c (2)(cid:17)2

one gets

det
22

t () =

ncyi=1

det

(18)

(19)

where we assumed that the values of spin c (2) can be dierent at dierent sites of the chain,
and

m

i = i  c (2)

i

.

(20)

while determinant of the transfer matrix (18) depends on dynamical variables only through
of the poisson algebra, dependence of the trace tr22t () is less trivial. still,
a only through hamiltonians of the spin chain (which are not casimirs but

casimirs c (2)
it depends on s(i)
poisson-commute with each other)  see further details in [4].

note that the above constructed system describes as many as nf = 2nc massive hypermul-
tiplets. this corresponds to the maximal system and is associated with the uv-nite theory.
this system depends on nc 1 physical moduli (rank of the group su(nc)) and on 2nc masses.
these moduli are parametrized by the exactly nc  1 independent integrals of motion1. this
system can be degenerated [8] to the theory with less number of massive hypermultiplets by
degenerating the lax operators on several sites, or to the pure gauge theory, with the lax
operators on all the sites being maximally degenerated. in this latter case, we return to the
toda chain [4].

dn gauge group. the main lesson of the previous section is that, in order to deal with
other gauge groups and fundamental matter, one needs to use the 2  2 lax representation.
now we turn to the rst non-trivial example of the dn gauge group. we work out this example
in some detail and further make shorter comments for the other groups. as above, we begin
with the d(1)

n -toda chain and then generalize it to the spin chain.

the toda chain associated with the d(1)

n group rst was applied to the description of the
sw anzatz for the so(2n) pure gauge theory in [3]. this system can be also described by two
dierent lax representations. first of all, there is 2n  2n representation [17]

1the nc-th integral of motion, the third projection of the full spin of the systempi

is supposed to be
zero. this condition is equivalent to zero full momentum of the system in the toda case above and is reected
in absence of the nc1-term in the polynomial p ().

(23)

now we show how this toda can be described within the framework of the 22 lax matrices.
the idea of this description goes back to e.sklyanin [13], who proposed to change boundary
conditions of the usual spin chain in accordance with the dynkin diagram of the group d(1)
n ,
see fig.2.

the rough description of the procedure looks as follows (see fig.3). first, one presents
the closed diagram, fig.3a, with two unusual lax operators k+ and k inserted. when
constructing the transfer-matrix, this diagram is passed around

t = k (1)

although this procedure may seem too pictorial, it turned out to be correct. indeed, let us

consider a system with the transfer matrix of the form

t ()  k+()k()

(25)

and discuss properties of the reection matrices k. to keep the system integrable (i.e. traces
of the transfer-matrices commuting), one should impose the reection equation

fig.3 obtaining d(1)

from the ring diagram of the a(1)-type

is, indeed, a good candidate for the transfer matrix in the system described by the picture of
fig.3.

in order to nd particular solutions k() to the reection equation describing the d(1)
n -
toda chain, take into account that they are associated, in accordance with fig.2, with the pairs
of vertices at each end of the dynkin diagram respectively. this hints to look them for as
quadratic polynomial (2  2) matrices. the toda chain solution of such a type can be found
from the commutation relations (26). indeed, one can construct the solution in the standard
way: rst, consider the general 2  2 matrix k()

k() =

a() b()

c() d() 

(28)

with all entries being quadratic polynomials (this concrete form can be achieved by the proper
shift of )

a(u) = 2 + a1 + a0

b(u) = 2 + b0
c(u) = 2 + c0

d() = a()

(29)

such a matrix celebrates the property k() = k 1(). inserting k() into (26), one imme-
diately gets [18] the quadratic poisson algebra

{a0, a1} = c0  b0,

{c0, a1} = 2a0  2c0,

{b0, a1} = 2b0  2a0,

{b0, a0} = 2a1b0,

{c0, a0} = 2a1c0,

{c0, b0} = 4a1a0

(30)

with ,  and  being central elements of the algebra (30) (any one of such (non-zero) elements
can be reduced to unity by rescaling ). the determinant of the reection matrix is equal to

det k() = (2 + )4 + q22  q0

(31)

7

where the casimir elements q0, q2 are

q2 = a2

1  2a0  c0  b0, q0 = a2

0 + b0c0.

(32)

these solutions in generic case can be interpreted as a pair of so(3) or so(2, 1) attached to
one cite.

now one can note that this solution gives too general curve  for the toda chain one does
not need any free parameters (casimir elements) associated with the ending cites.
indeed,
the suitable toda solution for k() can be associated with special values of the casimir and
central elements q0 = 0, q2 = 1,  = 0,  = 0 and  = 1 (isomorphic case is  = 0 while  = 1
associated with k+()) [19]

k() =

a1 + a0

2 + b0

c0

a1  a0



(33)

in this case, the poisson algebra (30) can be bosonized a1 = eq, a0 = 2peq, c0 = 2eq sinh q and
b0 = 2p2eq sinh q with {p, q} = 1.

then, the spectral curve can be easily obtained from (5), i.e. from

w2  trt  w + det t = 0

(34)

with the transfer matrix from (27) and using the manifest formulas (28) and (29). the result
is exactly (23), and can be obtained using that det t () = det k (1)
 = 4 and the
following

+ det k (2)

lemma. for arbitrary 2  2-matrix m() with polynomial entries such that m11() =
()m22() ( = 0, 1) and m12(), m21() are of a certain (the same) parity, the product
l1()m()l() with l() from (1) or (13) possesses the same properties.

similarly to the su(nc) case, in order to include the fundamental matter, one just needs
to the symmetry (this time, of the other diagonal (12),(21)) which releases the constraints on
casimir elements of the reection matrices. certainly, one also needs to substitute the toda
lax operators by the spin chain operators (13) (the resulting system is sometimes called the spin
chain interacting with the tops at the ends). thus, this time one imposes onto the reection
matrix the only condition q0 = 0 (with  = 0,  =  = 1)2

k() =

2 + b0
a1 + a0
2 + c0 a1  a0

 ,

a2

0 + b0c0 = q0 = 0

(35)

then, the determinant of the corresponding transfer matrix immediately leads to the spectral
curve [20] (taking into account the lemma)

w2  pn(2)w + 4q(2) = 0

(36)

where pn(2) =qn(2  2

i ) and is give n independent gauge moduli (=hamiltonians of the
spin chain). this number n is exactly the number of sites (counting k) on the diagram of
fig.3b. zeroes of the polynomial q() give masses of the hypermultiplets

q(2) =(cid:16)2  q(1)

2 (cid:17) n2yi (cid:16)2  (m+

i )2(cid:17)(cid:16)2  (m

(37)

2note that, in variance with the spin chain lax operator, one can not shift  by a constant inhomogeneity

in this matrix since the reection equation (26) depends not only on dierence of the spectral parameters.

with m
i as in (20). note that four of the masses are associated with the casimir functions
corresponding to the reection matrices, not to the lax operators. this means that, in contrast
to the su(nc) case, the four masses are distinguished. we return to this issue again in the
paragraph devoted to the brane picture.

now let us note that the number of hypermultiplets described by the curve (36) is 2n  2.
similarly to the su(nc) case, it should be associated with the maximal uv-nite system.
this is, indeed, the case, since the -function for the sqcd with so(2n) gauge group cor-
responding to the d(1)
system and nf fundamental hypermultiplets is equal to zero when
n
nf = 2n  2. note that this system is described by 2n gauge moduli i, in accordance with
(36).

where the reection matrices now correspond to single-root ending sites with two outcoming
lines each, instead of two-root end as in fig.3.

therefore, it is natural this time to look for the reection matrices linear in . we can

apply the same approach as above in order to obtain the solution [13, 18]

(39)

in variance with the quadratic reection matrix, the entries of this solution to the reection
equation are all poisson commuting, i.e. the reection matrix (39) does not contain dynamical
variables.

in order to describe the toda chain, as usual one has to restrict this reection matrix

the toda case and trt (0) = 2qq(1)

to obtain the spectral curve, we need to use the lemma, and also to note that trt (0) = 2 in

note that this time the number of independent gauge moduli, i.e. of hamiltonians in
integrable system is equal to the number of internal sites of the dynkin diagram, fig.4. this
reects the fact the ending (k-) matrices do not contain dynamical degrees of freedom.

now we come to the last series of the classical groups  the odd orthogonal series. the

from our previous consideration we know the reection matrices that are to be associated
with the ends of this dynkin diagram  one matrix is quadratic (28)-(29), the other one is linear.
note, however, that, in contrast to the symplectic case, the arrow at the end of the diagram is
directed inside. therefore, although being linear, the corresponding reection matrix is slightly
modied as compared with (39). namely, in accordance with [13, 21] it should be chosen for
the toda chain in the form

k() =

coecient 2 here can be replaced by any non-unit number not changing the nal result. as
before, we can use the lemma in order to derive the spectral curves. for the toda chain it is

3as before, this spectral curve can be also immediately presented as (12) with the 2(n + 1)  2(n + 1) lax

operator [17].

[21, 3]4

w2  pn(2)  w + 4 = 0

(47)

in variance with the previous cases, the toda reection matrix (46) is of quite symmetric
form and, therefore, one should not change it in order to include the fundamental matter. the
only thing to be done is that, instead of coecient 2 in (46) there should be introduced an
arbitrary coecient  6= 1 that plays the role of the only casimir element (this coecient
becomes essential in the spin chain case, see [8]).

certainly, the second, quadratic reection matrix is changed as for the d series (35). then,

one easily gets for the spin chain spectral curve [20]

sites of the dynkin diagram, fig.5 and with the left reection matrix depending on dynamical
variables.

note that the property of obtaining maximal uv nite system for the spin chain case
is preserved for all the classical groups. this property is equivalent to impossibility arbitrary
change the ratio of normalizations p () = trt and q() = det t . in turn, this ratio is changed
by twisting procedure [8] and can be rescaled for any degenerated case similar to the toda chain
 see discussion in [8].

brane picture. an alternative way to obtain the curves for susy ym theory is to
construct the brane picture behind it. the summary of the brane/integrability correspondence
can be found in [22]. in accordance with the standard type iia picture applicable to description
of the theory with su(nc) gauge group and nf = 2nc fundamental hypermultiplets5 [14], there
are two parallel ns5 branes lling the whole volume in (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)-directions, with nc
d4 branes stretched between them in x6 direction. these d4 branes lie along (x0, x1, x2, x3, x6)
coordinates and can move in the (x4, x5) plane giving nc  1 moduli (the center of masses is
decoupled corresponding to the u(1) factor).

this picture is associated with the pure gauge theory. one can include the fundamental
matter hypermultiplets in two possible ways. the rst one is to add nf semi-innite d4
branes ending on the ns5 branes. this corresponds to the n  n description of integrable
system [8]. the second way associated with the 2  2 lax representation is to consider instead
of semi-innite branes d6 branes extended in (x0, x1, x2, x3, x7, x8, x9) directions. the spin
chain description implies that with each d4 brane one associates a pair of d6 branes (inducing
hypermultiplet masses (20)), which gives in total nf = 2nc (degenerations mean decoupling of
some d6 branes). positions of the d6 branes in (x4, x5) plane give masses of the corresponding
hypermultiplets.

in order to generalize this picture to other classical groups, one should introduce into play

4again, this spectral curve is obtained from (12) related to the linear problem for the 2n  2n lax operator

[17]. to be absolutely precise, it comes with w  w in (47).

5we discuss here only this maximally non-degenerated case. degenerations are immediate.

an orientifold. this may be either o4 orientifold plane [15], or o6 orientifold [23]6. the role of
orientifold is to project out the brane picture to that with all branes having their mirror images
with respect to the orientifold. then, each physical brane is associated with a pair of mirror
branes. this procedure of gluing mirror images is much similar to the picture of fig.3 and, in
fact, just corresponds to description of a classical group g as z2-embedding into su(n) group
of enough higher n (roughly, n = 2rank of g).

the op orientifold has charge 2p4 in units of the dp brane charge. say, o4 orientifold
plane has charge 1 of the d4 charge. this orientifold lls the same volume as d4 branes and
is placed at x4 = x5 = 0. dierent signs of the orientifold charge are assigned with orientifold
projecting onto dierent groups. in fact, the charge assignment is quite tricky [15]  (+,-,+)
for the three regions to the left, between and to the right of the ns5 branes for even orthogonal
groups, (+,0,+) for odd orthogonal groups and (-,+,-) for symplectic groups. further details
on the brane picture may be found in [15].

similarly, the o6 orientifold has the world-volume extended in (x0, x1, x2, x3, x7, x8, x9) di-
rections and the charge 4 of the d6 charge. this time the sign assignment is much simpler
since the orientifold looks not like a line, but like a point in the essential (x4, x5, x6)-space.
therefore, there is no room for several regions with dierent signs. in fact, the sign + is
associated with the orientifold projection onto orthogonal groups on the world-volume of d4
branes7, while the sign -  with the projection onto symplectic groups. in contrast with the
o4 orientifold, the whole picture with this o6 orientifold looks quite immediately related to
the integrable spin chains described in the paper, and we are going to make some comments
here on the detailed picture, following mostly [23].

let us rst describe the so(2n) case. in this case, in accordance with fig.3, we have n  2
physical d4 branes (or 2(n  2) d4 branes and their mirror images) giving n  2 independent
gauge moduli8 (since brane mirror pairs moves dependently) and associated with the internal
sites of the dynkin diagram and a pair of (physical) d6 branes associated with each of these
d4 branes. the mirror structure is reected in the form of polynomials p (2) and q(2) in
(36) which have zeroes at i and mi respectively.

besides, there are two mirror pairs of d4 branes (or two physical d4 branes) associated
immediately with the orientifold, which correspond to the reection matrices. these 4 (2
physical) branes can move, since the reection matrices depend on dynamical variables, and,
therefore, correspond to two more independent gauge moduli. each of these distinguished
branes is typically assigned with a pair of d6 branes. while one d6 brane of the pair has
arbitrary (x4, x5) coordinates which give the mass of the corresponding hypermultiplet, the
other brane of the pair should be xed in x4 = x5 = 0. this pair of d6 branes has the mirror
pair assigned with the mirror d4 brane. totally, one has 4 coinciding d6 branes at x4 = x5 = 0
which contribute the factor 4 into the last term of (36) and corresponds to the charge +4 of the
orientifold o6. therefore, the orientifold in this picture looks as consisting of 4 coinciding d6
branes. similarity between orientifold and several coinciding branes has been already discussed

6in fact, the two cases are not absolutely equivalent: using dierent orientifolds gives rise to dierent spectral
curves coinciding only after a redenition of the spectral parameter w.
in particular, in the spectral curve
equation for the orthogonal group (36) there naturally emerges 2w for o4 [15] instead of w for o6. these
dierent spectral parameters appear in dierent, respectively n  n and 2  2 lax representations (cf.
[8]).
therefore, one can identify o6 orientifold with 2  2 representation and, thus, with the spin chain.

7this sign corresponds to symplectic group on d6 branes. since this system describes the avour group and
because of the dulaity between avour and gauge group, one can conclude that symplectic groups on d6 branes
correspond to orthogonal (gauge) groups on d4 branes [23].

8note that in presence of the orientifold there is no decoupling of the center of masses (i.e. of the u (1)

factor).

12

in many places (in the very close context, in [11]).

this picture can be almost literally transformed to the so(2n + 1) group. the only change
in this case is that one should associate with one of the reection matrices (the right one in
fig.5) the d4 brane placed in x4 = x5 = 0. therefore, there are no gauge moduli associated
with this brane (it can not move) and one should consider polynomial p (2) in (48) instead
of p (2) in (36). besides, this brane has no mirror since intersects with the orientifold in
(x4, x5, x6)-space. therefore, there are only two d6 branes associated with the corresponding
end of the dynkin diagram, both with coordinates x4 = x5 = 0. thus, it still produces 4-
term and the four coinciding d6 branes consisting the orientifold, but this time there are no
hypermultiplets assigned with this end of the dynkin diagram. this is reected in the form of
polynomial q(2) (48).

an analogous description for the symplectic group looks far more tricky [23]. not entering
the details, let us note that this time one should reproduce the orientifold charge -4. therefore,
it can not be produced merely by 4 d6 branes. instead, one could use some anti-d6-branes
associated with some anti-d4-brane, each of them contributing 1 instead of . then, one
places these anti-d4-branes onto the axis x4 = x5 = 0 (therefore, there are no gauge moduli
associated with them). each of them is accompanied by a pair of mirror anti-d6-branes

placed in  1qq(i)

respectively. this leads to the curve

the term 2 being due to the contributions of the anti-d4-branes. the constant in front of
it can be xed from requirement that the expression for the curve is to be a perfect square at
 = 0 [11]. this curve can be reduced to (43) by the replace w2  w. there is also a dierent
brane picture in this case (see, e.g., [11]) leading directly to the curve (43).

note that one would obtain the spectral curve of the spin chain in the form (50) choosing
dierent normalization of the reection matrix (41) (this normalization makes some sense, see
[18])

(51)

the natural question one may ask now is what is the meaning of the reection matrices
of more general form. in particular, one can consider the reection matrix to be of the form
(28)-(29) with arbitrary q0 and q2. this results in removing the singularity 4 in the last term
of (36), i.e. there will be a general quadratic polynomial of 2 instead. in brane terms, this
looks like the four coinciding d6 branes that formed the orientifold become split. therefore,
this phenomenon could be naturally associated with the orientifold splitting [24]. the curcial
dierence with the cited paper, however, is that there the splitting has emerged as a result of
non-perturbative corrections to the perturbative answer, while, in our case, all the corrections
are already taken into account. therefore, the amount of the splitting would provide another
non-perturbative parameter that can be related to the casimirs of the reection algebra.

at the same time, the general reection matrix of the form (39) (in the proper normalization)

k() =

(52)

can be associated with a deformation of the orientifold with charge -4. this deformation also
resolves the singularity 4 and, in a way, splits the orientifold.

moreover, it makes sense to consider even more general form of the reection matrix9 that

includes both (28)-(29) and (52)10 [18]

k() =

(53)

and ask for the corresponding brane picture. the simplest possible conjecture would be that
generalized reection matrices correspond to combined systems of dierent orientifolds. this
point deserves further investigation.

concluding comments. we have shown that in order to describe the n = 2 sqcd
for dierent classical groups within the integrability approach, one has to include into the
game non-trivial boundary reection matrices corresponding to the orientifolds in the brane
approach. parameters of the reection matrices are associated with positions of d4 and d6
in the brane set-up. we also discussed generalizations of reection matrices. the deformation
of the corresponding brane picture requires further investigations. the simplest deformation
is naturally associated with the orientifold splitting therefore it would be very interesting to
recognize the reection algebra behind the singularity structure of the elliptically bered calabi-
yau threefolds.

it would be also interesting to construct the generalization of this construction to 5d and
6d cases which looks quite immediate. indeed, it is known [7] that higher dimensional su(nc)
theories are described by the xxz and xyz chains in, respectively, 5 and 6 dimensions. there-
fore, the only problem is to extend these results to the other classical groups, i.e. to involve
non-trivial boundary conditions. this means that one has to construct the corresponding
(trigonometric or elliptic) solutions to the reection equation11. note that for constructing
elliptic (6d) systems of non-a(1)
n type one needs the standard numerical elliptic r-matrix of an
type. this is of crucial importance since there are no numerical elliptic r-matrices of non-an
type, which is an objection for constructing the corresponding integrable systems in n  n
representation.

the other quite immediate generalization of the proposed approach is to consider the spin
magnets given by lax matrices of larger size p (the so-called sl(p) spin chains) and the cor-
responding reection matrices. the periodic sl(p) spin chain has been considered in [8].
it
is shown to describe the n = 2 susy ym theory with the gauge group being the product
of several su(n) groups and with bi-fundamental matter hypermultiplets (see [14]). in order

9the reection matrix (53) is of the most general form for a certain class of reection matrices [25].
10note that  and  in this reection matrix are central elements and, therefore, do not eect the number of

gauge moduli.

11in fact, some solutions are already known, see, e.g., [26].

14

to extend this to the other classical groups, one merely needs to construct the corresponding
solutions to the reection equation (26). the brane picture for this case is discussed in [15, 23].

even more interesting problem would be to construct the generalization of the scheme
discussed in the paper to the exceptional groups e6, e7 and e8. in this case, we meet the new
phenomenon of junction on the dynkin diagram. if we learn how to deal with this case, it would
presumably imply a possibility of associating an integrable spin chain with arbitrary quivers,
not obligatory of the dynkin type. this would help to describe more general susy theories that
are a low-energy limit of string theory compactied onto manifolds whose singularity structure
is governed by the corresponding quivers.
