abstract

we investigate the transformation from ordinary gauge eld
to noncommutative one which was introduced by n. seiberg and
e. witten (hep-th/9908142). it is shown that the general trans-
formation which is determined only by gauge equivalence has a
path dependence in -space. this ambiguity is negligible when
we compare the ordinary dirac-born-infeld action with the non-
commutative one in the u(1) case, because of the u(1) nature
and slowly varying eld approximation. however, in general, in
the higher derivative approximation or in the u(n) case, the am-
biguity cannot be neglected due to its noncommutative structure.
this ambiguity corresponds to the degrees of freedom of eld re-
denition.

1 introduction

gauge theories on noncommutative spaces have been investigated for many
years from mathematical and physical viewpoint ([connes] and the references
in [sw]). especially in string theory, the worldvolume theory of d-branes in
a background b-eld is described by noncommutative yang-mills or dirac-
born-infeld theory.

recently, seiberg and witten [sw] argued the equivalence between or-
dinary gauge eld theory and the noncommutative one as the low energy
eective theories of open strings: they arise from the same two-dimensional
eld theory regularlized in dierent ways, so that there must be a transfor-
mation among them. in [sw], this transformation is uniquely given by the
gauge equivalence relation, and this implies the equivalence between ordinary
dirac-born-infeld action and the noncommutative one.

in this short note, we re-examine the validity of above arguments and
point out that the transformation of [sw] has in general ambiguities.
in
section 2, we begin with the gauge equivalence relation between two nearby
points in the -space and show that there is ambiguity with arbitrary con-
stant parameters. then, we discuss the path dependence of the transfor-
mation in the -space, which is found by considering the commutator of
two transformations. this implies the existence of another ambiguity.
in
section 3 we investigate these ambiguities from dierent viewpoint. next in
section 4, we consider the u(1) case in slowly varying eld approximation.
this is the situation of [sw] in comparing the ordinary dirac-born-infeld
action with the noncommutative one.
in this case the ambiguities do not
aect the result of [sw], because of the u(1) nature and of neglecting the
higher derivative terms. in section 5, we summarize the paper and give some
discussions. in note added, we argue that the path dependence can be
reduced to the eld redenition.

2 gauge equivalence relation

in [sw], they obtained a transformation from ordinary gauge eld ai (and
gauge parameter ) to noncommutative gauge eld ai (and gauge parameter
) by demanding the gauge equivalence relation between them. however, we
show that their statement has generally ambiguities. here we investigate the
gauge equivalence relation carefully.

consider a noncommutative, associative algebra denoted by a = (g 
c , ), where g is some lie algebra and the  product is dened to be the
tensor product of matrix multiplication with the product of functions such as

1

f (x)  g(x) := exp(cid:16)i kl

2



yk



zl(cid:17) f (y)g(z)|y=z=x with constant antisymmetric

tensor kl = lk. note that s are arbitrary parameters. we denote this
parameter space of the whole set of algebra {a} as -space .

we assume there exists some sort of mapping from a to another a in a
way that preserve gauge equivalence relation which is described by the follow-
ing equation in terms of gauge elds and gauge parameters ai( a), ( a, ) 
a and ai,   a:

ai( a) + 

ai( a) = ai( a + 

a),

(1)

ai = di =
where  is the gauge transformation with innitesimal , i.e., 
i  i[ ai, ]. 1 and likewise for . this relation means that the diagram
below is commutative.

ai



especially in the case of nearby points in , i.e.,  =  +  with innites-

imal , eq.(1) is written in the variational form as

 ai = 

ai

(2)

by writing a = a+ a( a)+o(2),  = +( a, )+o(2) and expanding
(1) to the rst order in .

we rst look for the solution of (1) by using the method described in the

next section. eq.(1) can be easily rewritten as2

 ai  di + i[ ai, ] =  1

kl{k ai, l},

(4)

which corresponds to the n = 1 case of (10). note that this form is actually
the same one as given in [sw]: the  version of eq.(3.4). it is solved most

where fij = i aj  j ai  i[ ai, aj] is the eld strength and ,  are arbitrary
constants. ( =  = 0 case corresponds to (3.8) of [sw].) the presence
of arbitrary parameters  and  implies that, with the requirement of the
gauge equivalence alone, there exists in general ambiguity in determining
an innitesimal mapping. however, note that this ambiguity has rather
trivial origin because we look for two functions  ai,  as the solution of one
equation (2), and that the terms with ,  have formally a form of some gauge
transformation. recall that the mapping that satises the gauge equivalence
relation is the one which maps gauge orbits from a to a rather than gauge
elds themselves. therefore, this kind of ambiguity is not relevant when we
discuss only gauge equivalence classes.

however, applying -variation twice, we will encounter the second kind
of ambiguities. denote each variation as 1 and 2, respectively, which are in
general dierent direction with each other in the -space, and consider their
commutation relation acting on ai:

[1, 2] ai,

which measures the path dependence in -space . using the transformation
(5) twice, we obtain explicitly

(7)

note that the sum of all ,  dependent terms again has the form of some
gauge transformation (with ai dependent parameter). this is easily under-
stood by noticing that the gauge transformations are closed under commu-
tation relations and the requirement (2). contrary, the ,  independent
terms are nontrivial and they do not vanish in general. that is, there exists
path dependence if we repeat variations more than one step in . in terms
of the gauge equivalence, (7) means the following. in the same sense as we
discussed below (5) for the one-step variation, a gauge orbit in a is mapped
to an orbit in a+1+2, but now depending on the path: orbits mapped
along two paths are not the same.

a vertical line denotes gauge orbit on a point in -space.

the double line denotes two dierent orbits on the same point.

this second type of ambiguities accumulates globally in -space, if we
consider any mapping from a to a at a nite distance apart in -space.
transformation on gauge elds is given by the integration over  by speci-
fying a path by hand as

 a.

(8)

a = zpath

of course,  a suers also from the rst type of ambiguities. if we further x
 and  by hand, i.e. select a representative, then a is uniquely determined.
the procedure described in [sw], where the functional a(a) is determined
order by order in , is exactly the one discussed here. in fact, the solution
of [sw] corresponds to taking  =  = 0 and the straight line in -space
as the path of integration. here the straight line corresponds to the formal
exponentiation of the innitesimal transformation (5).

note that there exists no rule to select a particular path from the stand-
point of gauge theory (or more precisely a space of the whole set of algebra
{a}.) we need some physical requirement. in 4 we discuss the equiva-
lence of actions between ordinary gauge theory and noncommutative one in
this point of view.

3 more comments on ambiguity

in this section, we investigate the gauge equivalence relation (1) from another
viewpoint.

to get a solution of (1) directly, we expand formally ai as the power

series in  =   :





ai =

i = ai, (0) = . substituting

suitable indices3 and substitute it to the left hand side of (10), then we can
determine the coecients in the polynomial.

polynomial of ai, , j ak, . . . , mn alone and indices are contracted among them.

, (n) + 0(n) are also a solution of (10) if a(n)

noting that



ai = i  i[ ai, ],

(12)

and that  and the commutator [ ,
following identity for any polynomial g of ai, di aj, . . . in a:

] satisfy leibnitz rule, we obtain the



g( aj, dk al, . . .)  


g( aj, dk al, . . .) + i[ g( aj, dk al, . . .), ] = 0,

(13)

where 

in di (hence di


acts like i

i.e., replaces ai with i but does not act on ai

di). in the same way,



fij = i[ fij , ], 

dk fij = i[ dk fij, ], . . . ,

lead to



gf ( fjk, dl fmn, . . .) + ih gf ( fjk, dl fmn, . . .), i = 0,
where gf ( fjk, dl fmn, . . .) is a polynomial of fjk, dl fmn, . . . in a.

from (13) and (15), we get one type of solution of (11)

( fjk, dl fmn, . . . ; n) + di g(n)( aj, dk al, . . . ; n),

(14)

(15)

(16)

this means that there is large ambiguity due to arbitrary polynomials
g(n)( aj, dk al, . . . ; n), g(n)f
result is consistent with the ambiguity due to the path dependence of 2.

in particular, if we take  innitesimal, then the ambiguity is of the form

g(1)f

( fjk, dl fmn, . . . ; 1) = 1kl di fkl,

where 1, 1, 2 are arbitrary constants. substituting (17) into (16), we get

0(1) = kl(21[k , al] + 2 dkl) = (21  i2)kl[k , al]. (18)

by redenition of coecients, this is the ,  dependent term in (5).

4 u (1) case

in this section, we consider the case where the gauge group is u(1). we
assume here that fij is slowly varying so that we can ignore o( f ). this
approximation is adopted when we consider the dirac-born-infeld action.
precisely, we regard f   a as o(1) and count the order by (the number
of )(that of a). note that di = i + jkj aik + o(4 f ), fij = i aj 
j ai + klk ail aj + o(4 f ), and that ,  dependent terms in  ai in (5)
are of o(2 f ), and hence negligible.

eq.(7) reduces in this approximation to

the right hand sides of (19) and (20) have terms that is not of o( f ) but is of

in [sw] they showed that the ordinary dirac-born-infeld lagrangian
equals the noncommutative one up to total derivative terms and up to o( f ).

4 the rst equality of (20) is exact even in the u (n ) case and the second one is valid

only in the u (1) case.

5 notice that, if kl 6= 0, fij is not gauge invariant even in the u (1) case.

7

they argued that the more general lagrangian

ldbi =

1

gsqdet(g + f + )

(21)

is invariant up to total derivative terms and up to o( f ) under the variation
with respect to . the gauge eld of ordinary dirac-born-infeld theory is
in a=0 and noncommutative one is in a6=0.6
in their proof, eq.(5) with
 =  = 0 is used. there is in general ambiguity due to ,  dependence in
(5) but this is negligible.

as we discussed in the previous sections, there is ambiguity due to path

dependence in -space. this implies that

ldbi|  ldbi| = zpath

 ldbi.

(22)

however, this path dependence is in fact missing as seen from the gauge
transformation form of (19) and (20). therefore their proof of equivalence
between the ordinary dirac-born-infeld action and the noncommutative one
(or more generally the equivalence of the action (21) in -space) is also justi-
ed in our context. this means that in this physical input (i.e., equivalence
of the ordinary dbi action and noncommutative one) no ambiguity is re-
stricted.

5 conclusions and discussions

in this paper, we considered a transformation from ai,   a to ai,  
a which is determined by gauge equivalence. this transformation has
large ambiguity due to path dependence in -space. however this ambiguity
is negligible in particular in the u(1) case and in rough approximation of
ignoring o( f ). this fact justies the equivalence of noncommutative dirac-
born-infeld lagrangian (21) in the -space.

however the ambiguity is no longer negligible in the u(n) case or in the
u(1) case if  6= 0 and higher derivative correction is considered because the
path dependence (7) is not of the form of gauge transformation. so if one
considers higher derivative correction from the dirac-born-infeld action or
the u(n) generalization of (21) by using transformation determined only by
gauge equivalence, we need a more careful argument. geometrical interpre-
tation of the variation with respect to  such as (5) would be required.

6 the antisymmetric tensor  is given by

g+b , where g, g, b is the open

string metric, the closed string metric and the ns 2-form eld, respectively.

eq.(7) can be rewritten as follows:7

(24)

the rst term on the right hand side is local and gauge-covariant. so, it
can be absorbed by a eld redenition of the gauge eld ai.8 the rest is of
the form of gauge transformation. the former corresponds to the ambiguity
of g(n)f

and the latter to that of g(n)

i
this shows that, if we require a physical input such that a noncommu-
tative gauge eld would be dened only up to eld redenitions, physics does
not generally depend on paths in -space.9
