abstract

we study a new class of n=1 supersymmetric orientifolds in six space-time dimensions.

the world-sheet parity transformation is combined with a permutation of the internal

complex coordinates. in contrast to ordinary orientifolds the twisted sectors contribute to

the klein bottle amplitude leading to new tadpoles to be cancelled by twisted open string

sectors. they arise from open strings stretched between d7-branes intersecting at non-

trivial angles. we study in detail the zz3, zz4 and zz6 permutational orientifolds obtaining
in all cases anomaly free massless spectra.

1. introduction

in recent years we have seen the main activity in string model building shifting from

the foremost promising class of heterotic calabi-yau compactications to compact type i

and orientifold models. the latter class generically contains d-branes in the background

supporting the gauge sector of the low energy theory, whereas gravity propagates in the

ten-dimensional bulk. therefore, such models became quite attractive in recent attempts

to establish a unication scenario with the string scale as low as 1tev [1].

in contrast to the millions of consistent models partly classied in the calabi-yau

setting, so far we know comparatively few examples of orientifold models. this is mainly

due to the fact that the only consistency condition we know of, namely tadpole cancellation,

requires the complete knowledge of the one-loop partition function. therefore we nd

ourselves restricted to toroidal orbifolds and gepner models which were discussed in six

at dimensions in [2-8] and in four dimensions in [9-15].

in this paper we study a new class of orientifolds of type iib where the world-
sheet parity transformation is combined with an s2 permutation of the internal complex
coordinates. in real coordinates the permutation is nothing else than a reection of some of

the internal coordinates, not preserving the complex structure. as a consequence, in these

permutational orientifolds the twisted sector klein bottle amplitudes are non-vanishing

implying new tadpoles, which should be cancelled by introducing something like twisted

open string sectors. as we will show, these new sectors automatically arise due to the

geometric zzn symmetry and are provided by d7-branes intersecting at non-trivial angles.

inclusion of these twisted open string sectors indeed allows us to cancel the klein bottle

tadpoles and nally leads to massless closed and open string spectra satisfying the n=1

anomaly constraint.

in a dierent class of models [16] the request for twisted open string sectors was

expressed, as well, however it was argued that there these state are non-perturbative from

the orientifold point of view but could nevertheless be detected by using type i - heterotic

duality. it is so far not clear to us, whether the methods developed in the present paper

could lead to new insight into the twisted open string sectors needed in those models

discussed in [16].

moreover, since in the permutational orientifolds all twisted sectors are left invari-

ant, the non-supersymmetric type 0b generalization [17] could lead to new tachyon-free

orientifolds of the type discussed in [18].

1

this paper is organized as follows.

in section two we will dene our models and

present the computation of the zz3 orientifold in very much detail. in section three we will

discuss the zz4 and zz6 orientifolds, thereby focusing mostly on the new issues compared

to the zz3 case. finally, we will end with some conclusions.

2. the zz3 permutational orientifold

the six dimensional models studied in the course of this paper are dened as follows.
we compactify type iib on the four torus t 4 with two complex coordinates x = x8 + ix9

and y = x6 + ix7. then we take the orientifold by the group g + rg, where the space-
time symmetry group is g = zzn with one of the four choices n  {2, 3, 4, 6} allowing for a
crystallographic action. the supersymmetry preserving action of zzn on the two complex

coordinates is given by

 :(cid:26) x  e2i 1
n x
y  e2i 1
n y

.

(2.1)

in the orientifold the world-sheet parity transformation is always paired with the following

zz2 operation

r :(cid:26) x  x

y  y

.

(2.2)

thus, from the perspective of the complex coordinates it is nothing else than a permutation,

whereas from the perspective of the real coordinates xi it is the reection in the x7 and

x9 direction. we also have to specify the action of r on the ramond sector ground states
r : |s1 s2 s3 s4i  |s1 s2  s3  s4i. note, that the combination r is related to  by
t-duality in the x7 and x9 direction. however, under this t-duality the geometric zzn
operation  is mapped to t t 1 =  acting in an asymmetric way on the left and right

moving components of the elds x and y

 :(cid:26) xl  e2i 1
yl  e2i 1

n xl, xr  e2i 1
yr  e2i 1
n yr
n yl,

n xr

.

(2.3)

thus, the orientifolds we are going to discuss are not related via t-duality to the ordinary

orientifolds.

to our knowledge permutational orientifolds were discussed for the rst time in [19]

in the context of non-supersymmetric string theory. the combination of  with r has

2

dramatic consequences for the computation of the tadpole cancellation conditions as com-

pared to usual orientifold models. first of all, we observe that r does not commute with

zzn , instead one encounters the relation

rk = n kr,

(2.4)

where  denotes the generator of zzn . as a consequence, using the geometry of the klein
bottle as shown in gure 1 one obtains for the twist g = (rk)2 = (rl)2 = 1, so that
in the tree channel only untwisted closed string states propagate along the tube. therefore,

we expect to nd only untwisted tadpoles.

g

lr

r k

figure 1

moreover, in all orientifold models studied so far, the action of the world-sheet parity
on the twisted sector ground states was such, that the sector twisted by k was mapped to
the sector twisted by n k. thus, only the untwisted and some zz2 twisted sectors gave a
non-vanishing contribution to the klein bottle amplitude, which were cancelled by annulus

and mobius contributions of d9- and d5-branes in most cases. now, the permutation r
by itself also exchanges the k twisted sector with the n  k twisted sector, as can be seen
directly from the denition of the twisted sector. in the k twisted sector the eld x has

the following monodromy

x( + 2,  ) = e2i k

n x(,  ),

x( + 2,  ) = e2i k

n x(,  ),

(2.5)

which this mapped under the action of r to

x( + 2,  ) = e2i k

n x(,  ),

x( + 2,  ) = e2i k

n x(,  ).

(2.6)

thus, after applying r the eld x lies in the nk twisted sector. therefore, the combined
operation r leaves the twisted sector invariant and one expects non-vanishing contribu-
tions to the klein-bottle amplitude from all n1 twisted sectors1. note, that the k twisted
1 this essential point was not realized in [20] and renders the whole computation performed

there fairly questionable.

3

sectors of the asymmetric bzz3 orbifold are left invariant under  and are mapped to the

n  k twisted sectors under r. this conrms the t-duality relation of these models to
ordinary orientifolds.

we are now facing the problem of how to introduce twisted open string sectors with

the ability to cancel these tadpoles arising in the twisted klein bottle amplitudes. in usual

orientifolds open strings stretched between the same type of d-branes can be regarded as

untwisted open string sectors and open strings stretched between a d9- and a d5-brane

can be regarded as zz2 twisted open string sectors.

the problem of twisted open string sectors was also raised in a slightly dierent class

of orientifolds in [16], where it was simply enforced by hand that  did not exchange the

twisted sectors. the conclusion there was, that these twisted open string sectors are non-

perturbative in nature and could be detected by using type i - heterotic duality. we would

like to make the following point clear. we are not claiming that these non-perturbative

states found there do allow for a perturbative description. what we will show is, that

in a dierent class of orientifolds twisted open string sectors can indeed be described in

a perturbative way, namely by open strings stretched between d7-branes intersecting at

non-trivial angles.

in the rest of this section we will construct the zz3 permutational orientifold in some

detail revealing how nicely everything ts together. before that let us remark, that the zz2

permutational orientifold is isomorphic to the ordinary one, as in that case the action of

zz2 is the same on all four compact coordinates and it is a matter of taste which two are

named x and y. thus, in that case one simply gets the t-dual of the gimon-polchinski

model [3] containing instead of d9- and d5-branes two dierent sorts of d7-branes. the

rst non-trivial example is the zz3 orientifold.

2.1. klein bottle amplitude

before we can compute the klein bottle amplitude we need to review some facts

about the two dimensional zz3 lattice. in both the (67) and the (89) plane we choose the
elementary cell of the t 2 torus as shown in gure 2.

the left-right moving momenta are given by

li =

(n1~e1 + n2~e2) .

(2.8)

here we have chosen  = 2. the basis and the dual basis are

~e1 = (2, 0),

~e 
1 = (

).

in gure 2 we have also denoted the three xed points of the zz3 action on each t 2. note,
that under the permutation r the origin is invariant whereas the other two xed points

get exchanged. now we have to compute the klein bottle amplitude

(2.10)

where the momentum integration in the non-compact directions has already been carried
out and c = v6/(82)3. let us rst discuss the untwisted sector.

a.) untwisted sector

unlike the purely  orientifold where left-right combinations of states of the schematic
form x x and y y were contributing in the klein bottle amplitude, in our case the states

xex and yey are relevant. since  acts on these states as
(yey ) = yey

(xex) = xex,

i.e. without any phase factor, each term in the sum (1 +  + 2)/3 in (2.10) yields the

(2.11)

same result in the oscillator part of the trace.

5

this is also true for the lattice part due to its zz3 symmetry. note that r is the
reection at the axes dened by ~e1, r is the reection at ~e2 and r2 is the reection at
~e1+~e2. under the action of r only kk momentum in the x6 and x8 direction and winding
in the x7 and x9 direction survives. using the expression in (2.8) and (2.9), one nds that
p 6 = (2m)/r, l7 = 3nr and similarly for the second torus. it is now straightforward to
compute the untwisted klein bottle amplitude

(2.12)

where the argument of the -function is exp(4t) and as in [3]  = r2/.
b.) twisted sectors

in the zz3 twisted sector the lattice part is trivial and the action of r on the oscillator
modes is analogous to (2.11). we have to sum over all nine xed points in each twisted

sector, however only one of them is invariant under the action of r. thus, the  twisted

sector contribution to the klein bottle amplitude is

(2.13)

the 2 twisted sector contribution to the klein bottle amplitude can be obtained simply by

1/2(cid:3) with (cid:2) a

1/2(cid:3) in (2.13) and actually leads to the same partition function.

having everything expressed in terms of -functions the transformation into tree-channel

exchanging (cid:2) a

is straightforward and yields for the complete klein bottle amplitude

(2.14)

with the argument exp(4l). as expected we only nd untwisted tadpoles and the
numerical factors in front of the -functions in (2.14) are exactly 4 sin2(k/n ). this

guarantees that only zz3 invariant states from the untwisted closed string sector propagate
along the tube of the tree channel klein bottle. in other words, the three dierent terms

6

in (2.14) really constitute the complete projector (1 +  + 2)/3 acting on the untwisted

states in tree channel. note, from our loop channel computation this matching appears to

be some nice conspiracy between the numerical lattice factors from the untwisted sector

and the number of invariant xed points in the twisted sectors. in the open string sector

we will promote this completion of the projector in tree-channel to our guiding principle

in determining the relative normalizations of the dierent open string sectors.

2.2. annulus amplitude

since via t-duality in the x7 and x9 directions r is related to , we expect that

we need d7-branes to cancel the klein-bottle tadpoles. moreover, in the four internal

coordinates these d7-branes should extend in the x6 and x8 direction and ll the complete

six-dimensional uncompactied space-time. let us assume rst that we stuck together m

d7-branes on the x7 = x9 = 0 line xed under r. the entire arrangement of d7-branes

has to satisfy the geometric zz3 symmetry we would like to mod out. therefore, we are

forced to introduce rotated d7-branes, as well. more concretely, in both the (67) and the

(89) plane we get the 1 = 2/3 and 2 = 4/3 rotated d7-branes as shown in gure 3.

thus, we are automatically forced to introduce d7-branes intersecting at non-trivial angles

which were discussed before in various papers dealing with supersymmetry preserving brane

congurations [21]. due to the analysis in [21] the rotated d7-branes depicted in gure 3

have eight unbroken supersymmetries, exactly what is needed for n=1 in six dimensions.

7

in order to derive the mode expansion for open strings connecting d-branes at angles in

the (67) and (89) plane let us restrict rst to the (89) plane and assume for simplicity

that one d-brane is stretching in the x8 direction. an open string ending on this d-brane
satises the following boundary conditions




x 8(0,  ) = 0,

x 9(0,  ) = 0.

(2.15)

the other end of the open string ends on a dierent d-brane which is rotated by an angle

 =  against the former d-brane. therefore, the boundary conditions at  =  have

the following form

the solution to these two equation is

cos()







x 8(,  ) + sin()

x 9(,  ) = 0
 sin() x 8(,  ) + cos() x 9(,  ) = 0.

showing that one indeed obtains something deserving the name twisted open string sector.

the calculation for the world sheet fermions and for the (67) plane is completely analogous.

in the following we will denote the number of each type of d7-brane as m . the annulus

has to be computed for all possible open strings connecting the three kinds of d7-branes.

a.) untwisted sector

by untwisted open string sector we mean open strings stretched between two d-branes of
the same kind. since the zz3 action rotates the d7-branes, it is clear that the  and 2
insertions in the trace in (2.18) vanish identically. the oscillator contribution to the trace

is as usual and, due to the zz3 symmetry, the lattice contribution is the same for each type
of d7-brane. more concretely, the kk momentum in the x6 and x8 direction is quantized
as p = m/r and for the winding in the x7 and x9 direction we nd l = nr3/2. thus,
the complete untwisted annulus amplitude is

b.) twisted sectors

under twisted open string sectors we understand open strings stretched between dier-

ent types of d7-branes. since the dierent d7-branes do not share any direction, the

contribution from the lattice to the annulus amplitude is trivial and one easily gets

(2.22)

where we also distinguish between untwisted and twisted contributions.

a.) untwisted sector

since the 71 branes are reected onto themselves under r, we expect to nd a nonzero
contribution for m7171 with the r insertion. similarly, we expect that m7272 is only non-
zero with the r2 insertion and that m7373 is only non-zero with the r insertion. the

9

trace over the oscillator part is as described in [3]. however, as in the annulus amplitude

for the kk momenta in the x6 and x8 directions all p = m/r contribute but for the
winding in the x7 and x9 direction only doubly wound modes l = nr3 are invariant.
thus, for the untwisted mobius amplitude we obtain

2.4. tadpole cancellation and massless spectrum

adding up all tree channel amplitudes from the klein bottle, annulus and mobius

strip we extract only one single tadpole cancellation condition

thus, in contrast to the 32 d-branes usually appearing in pure  orientifolds, there are

now only eight d7-branes of each kind. the next step is to compute the massless spectrum

arising in both the closed and the open string sector and to show that it indeed satises

anomaly cancellation.

the computation in the closed string sector diers from the analogous computation in

the case of the usual  orientifolds. in the untwisted sector we nd the n=1 supergravity

multiplet and 3 hypermultiplets. in a twisted sector we have nine zz3 xed points. the
one xed point invariant under r contributes 1 hypermultiplet. the remaining eight

xed points form four pairs under the action of r leading to 4 tensormultiplets and 4

hypermultiplets. since there are two twisted sectors we end up with the massless closed

string spectrum

1 sugra + 8 tensormultiplets + 13 hypermultiplets .

in the open string sector we nd in the untwisted sector one vectormultiplet in the adjoint

of so(8) and one hypermultiplet in the adjoint, as well. moreover, there appears one

further hypermultiplet in the adjoint from the twisted sector, so that we end up with

g=so(8) with 2 hypermultiplets in the adjoint .

the closed and open string spectrum together satisfy the anomaly constraint

nh  nv + 29 nt = 273.

(2.28)

it is not necessary to place all 71 branes neither on top of each other nor at the xed line
of r. the position of the 72 and 73 branes are of course still related to the position of the
71 branes due to the zz3 symmetry. changing the position of the 71 branes in the (68)
plane is reected in the eective theory as a higgs branch on which the gauge symmetry is

broken to some subgroups. for instance, placing four 71 branes at a position x6 = x8 = a
with a 6= 0 and necessarily the remaining four 71 branes at x6 = x8 = a, we derive the
following massless spectrum

this is related to the maximal spectrum via higgsing and consistently satises the anomaly

g=u(4) with 2  adj + 2  6 .

constraint, as well.

we presented a purely perturbative treatment of these new permutational orientifolds

thereby describing twisted open string sectors by d7-branes intersecting at 60 and 120

degree angles. as we will see in the next sections some new aspects will arise when

considering the other two possible zz4 and zz6 cases.

11

3. the zz4 permutational orientifold

in case of the zz4 orientifold some new issues arise which were absent in the zz3 case.

a rst attempt to choose the rectangular zz4 symmetric lattice with basis vectors in the

(67) and (89) direction, respectively, failed, as in the tree channel klein bottle amplitude
the complete projector (1 +  + 2 + 3)/4 did not show up. in particular in that case
we found that the lattice part for the {1, 2} insertions in the klein bottle trace diered
from the result for the {, 3} insertions. the resolution to this puzzle is to start in the
(89) plane with the lattice in gure 4

we have depicted the zz4 xed points by black circles and the additional zz2 xed by

white circles. from the gures it is evident that all four zz4 xed points are also invariant

under r and that only eight of the sixteen zz2 xed points are invariant. thus, the  and
3 twisted sector contribution to the klein bottle amplitude is weighted by a factor of
four and the 2 twisted sector contribution is weighted by a factor of eight. the actual

computation is completely similar to the zz3 case and yields after all the following tree

with the argument exp(4l). the last term in (3.1) arises in the 2 twisted sector
and is actually zero. nevertheless, its coecient still demonstrates the appearance of the
complete projector with numerical prefactors 4 sin2(k/n ) in front of the -functions. the
next step is to introduce appropriate d7-branes to cancel the tadpoles in (3.1). the right

choice to do that is shown in gure 6.

unlike the zz3 case, here we have two sets of d7-branes which are not related by zz4 rota-
tions, namely the {71, 73} and the {72, 74} sets close under zz4 rotations. thus, eventually
we expect to get a product gauge group with two factors, one living on the rst set of

d7-branes and one living on the second set of d7-branes. since there exists a zz2 subgroup
leaving the dierent d7-branes invariant we get an action of the zz2 on the chan-paton
factors of each d7-brane. as usual this action is described by a unitary matrix, denoted

13

as 2 . due to the symmetry of the problem, we assume in the following that these four a

priori dierent -matrices are all identical. the computation of the dierent terms in the

annulus amplitude is now straightforward. however, one nds that in the loop channel
the complete projector does not constitute itself, in fact the untwisted and 1,3 twisted
sectors are ne, but the 2 sector is too small by a factor of two. looking into the details
reveals that in a zzn orientifold the k twisted open string sector, ak , has to be weighted
by an extra factor of

k =

n(cid:1)
sin2(cid:0) k
n(cid:1) .
sin2(cid:0) 

this is similar to ordinary orientifolds with a discrete background nsns two-form b-

eld [22,8], where also the sector of open strings stretched between d9- and d5-branes is
weighted by an extra factor of 2rg(b)/2. analogously, also in our case it turns out that

these prefactors are crucial for satisfying the anomaly constraint. of course, it would be

nice to have a deeper understanding of these extra factors from the loop channel point

of view. unfortunately, we cannot oer a satisfying explanation yet. the complete tree

channel annulus amplitude is

tribute here, as in tree channel we expect to nd some non-zero terms in the zz4 twisted
sectors. however, due to the dierent rules for the transformation from loop into tree

channel in the mobius amplitude and the relation (2.24), it nally comes out just right.

moreover, the sectors in (3.6) are exactly those weighted by this extra factor of two. this

degeneration has to be taken into account in the mobius amplitude, as well. as we shall

nd in the zz6 example it can happen that the action of the zz2 subgroup must be dierent
in the degenerated sectors in order to guarantee completion of the projector in the tree

channel mobius amplitude. for the tree channel mobius amplitude we nd

with argument exp(8l). thus, also the mobius amplitude conrms that the (7173) as
well as the (7274) sector must be weighted by an extra factor 2 = 2. note, that the second
term in (3.7) is the sum of the  and the 3 twisted open string sector.

adding up all tree channel amplitudes we derive two tadpole cancellation conditions

1
4

(m  16)2 = 0,

tr(2 ) = 0,

(3.8)

yielding m = 16 d7-branes of each type. the computation of the closed string massless

spectrum gives one supergravity and 3 hypermultiplets from the untwisted sector. in the

twisted sector one has to be very careful in treating the xed points in the right way. the

15

four zz4 xed points contribute eight further hypermultiplets. the eight zz2 xed points

invariant under r give six hypermultiplets and the remaining eight xed points yield

three hypermultiplets and one tensormultiplet. adding up all states we nd

1 sugra + 1 tensormultiplets + 20 hypermultiplets .

for the open strings the untwisted sector gives a vectormultiplet in the adjoint of u(8)
u(8) and two hypermultiplets in the antisymmetric representation for each gauge factor.

the  and 3 twisted sector contributes two hypermultiplets in the bifundamental repre-

sentation and nally the 2 twisted open string sector yields another two hypermultiplets

in the antisymmetric representation for each gauge factor. in the latter we have taken into

account the extra degeneration in this sector. summarizing we get

g=u(8) u(8) with 4  (28, 1) + 4  (1, 28) + 2  (8, 8).

it is easily checked that the closed and open string spectrum above satises the anomaly

constraint.

4. the zz6 permutational orientifold

in the zz6 orientifold there arises only one new issue as compared to the zz3 and zz4

examples to be discussed shortly. the rest of the computation is completely analogous

and we will skip most of the details. analogous to what we encountered in the zz4 case,

we are free to choose in the (89) plane the lattice in gure 7.

in the (67) plane we are forced to take the rotated lattice as shown in gure 8.

the one zz6 xed point is denoted by a white circle, the additional two zz3 xed points

by black circles and the additional three zz2 xed points by grey circles. the behaviour of

the xed points under the reection r is obvious, namely three of the nine zz3 xed points

and four of the sixteen zz2 xed points are invariant under r. computing the klein bottle

amplitude we realize that these numbers are exactly those needed to get the complete

zz6 projector in tree-channel. the tadpoles appearing in the klein bottle amplitude can

be cancelled by introducing six dierent d7-branes rotated against each other by thirty

degrees as shown in gure 9.

under the action of zz6 the elements of two sets {71, 73, 75} and {72, 74, 76} are transformed
among themselves. open strings of type (7i7i) can be understood as the untwisted sector
and open strings of type (7i7i+3) as the 3 twisted sector. the remaining two 2,4 and
1,5 twisted sectors are given by open strings of type (7i7i+2) and (7i7i+1), respectively.
in the computation of the twisted sector annulus amplitude, we have to introduce those

extra factors (3.2). the resulting expressions are very similar to the zz4 annulus amplitude
(3.3).

the only sectors contributing to the loop channel mobius amplitude are the untwisted

one and the one arising from open strings in the (7i7i+2) sector. in the (7173) sector, for
instance, the two terms

tr7173(cid:18) r

2

 + 4

6

pgso e2tl0(cid:19)

(4.1)

are non-vanishing. the rst one gives rise to a contribution of the  twisted sector in the
mobius tree channel amplitude and the second one yields a contribution to the 2 twisted

sector. the projector tells us that the relative normalization of these two factors in the

tree channel must be fm2 = 3fm. however, from the annulus amplitude the overall

normalization of the (7i7i+2) sector is xed to be three. it is possible to to repare that by
requiring that in the three degenerated (7i7i+2) sectors the action of 3 is not identical.
in two sectors it must yield a plus sign and in one sector a minus sign. fortunately, our

guiding principle again allows us to x everything. apparently, this extra minus sign in

one of the three degenerated sectors has dramatic consequences for the computation of

the massless spectrum. a detailed investigation reveals that a plus sign gives rise to two

antisymmetric representations of the u(n) gauge group living on the branes as opposed

to a minus sign, giving rise to one antisymmetric and one symmetric representation. we

will see shortly that the latter is exactly needed for anomaly cancellation.

the two tadpole cancellation conditions in the zz6 case are

1
2

(m  8)2 = 0,

tr(3) = 0.

(4.2)

the computation of the closed string massless spectrum yields one supergravity and 3

hypermultiplets from the untwisted sector. two further hypermultiplets come from the

zz6 xed point. the nine zz3 xed points give rise to two tensormultiplets and eight
hypermultiplets. finally, the sixteen zz2 xed points yield one tensormultiplet and ve
hypermultiplets. adding up all these states we nd

18

1 sugra + 3 tensormultiplets + 18 hypermultiplets .

for the open strings the untwisted sector gives rise to a vectormultiplet in the adjoint of
u(4)u(4) and two hypermultiplets in the antisymmetric representation for each gauge
factor. the  and 5 twisted sector contribute two hypermultiplets in the bifundamental
representation. taking into account the above mentioned extra minus sign in the 2,4

twisted open string sector we obtain ve hypermultiplets in the antisymmetric representa-

tion and one hypermultiplet in the symmetric representation for each gauge factor. finally,
four further hypermultiplets in the bifundamental representation arise in the 3 twisted

open string sector. summarizing we get

g=u(4)u(4) with 7  (6, 1) + 7  (1, 6) + (10, 1) + (1, 10) + 6  (4, 4),

which together with the closed string spectrum indeed satises the anomaly constraint.

5. conclusion

we have studied a new class of orientifolds in which the world-sheet parity transfor-

mation is combined with a permutation of the internal coordinates. as the main new issue

we encountered non-zero contributions to the twisted sector klein bottle amplitude, which

fortunately can be cancelled by introducing d7-branes intersecting at non-trivial angles

into the background. we have studied all possible n=1 supersymmetric examples in six-

dimensions, performed the complete tadpole cancellation computation and found after all

reasonable anomaly-free massless spectra. we would like to emphasize again that the main

tool or guiding principle used in the construction was the requirement of always getting

the complete zzn projector in the tree channel amplitude after modular transformation of
the loop channel.

there exist a lot of open questions related to the permutational orientifolds we have

presented in this paper. for instance, it is interesting to study models of this type in four

space dimensions with n=1 supersymmetry [23]. moreover, these models are particularly

suitable to yield non-tachyonic type 0b generalizations [17]. it is not evident what happens

when one turns on some background two form ux and nally there might exist some dual

f-theory descriptions.

we would like to thank dieter lust for encouraging discussions.
