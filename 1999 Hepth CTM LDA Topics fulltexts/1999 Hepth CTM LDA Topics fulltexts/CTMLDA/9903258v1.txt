abstract

we have investigated the perturbative ambiguity of the radiatively induced
chern-simons term in dierential regularization. the result obtained in this
method contains all those obtained in other regularization schemes and the
ambiguity is explicitly characterized by an indenite ratio of two renormal-
ization scales.
it is argued that the ambiguity can only be eliminated by
either imposing a physical requirement or resorting to a more fundamental
principle. some calculation techniques in coordinate space are developed in
the appendices.

ization ambiguity; convolution integral.

in a relativistic quantum eld theory, lorentz and cpt violating terms should be strictly
prohibited. otherwise, the status of special relativity, as one of the cornerstone of modern
physics, will be challenged. however, recently some investigations have been carried out to
consider this possibility [1, 2]. motivated by the proposal put forward about a decade ago of
introducing a chern-simons term [3], lk = 1/2kfa, to violate the lorentz and cpt
symmetry of quantum electrodynamics, recently a lorentz and cpt violating extension of
the standard model was constructed and some of its quantum aspects were investigated [2].
as pointed out by jackiw [4], the availability of higher precision instruments nowadays allows
a more strict test on some of fundamental principles to be carried out. such an investigation
at least at theoretical level is not completely unreasonable. the question is how this lorentz
and cpt violating term can naturally arise rather than introducing it by hand.

based on the experience in 2+1-dimensional qed [5], where a parity-odd chern-simons
term is induced from the fermionic determinant [6, 7], one natural guess is that this lorentz
and cpt violation term can come from a lorentz and cpt violation term b/5 in the
fermionic sector. the explicit calculation carried out recently shows that this case can
happen [8, 9], there has induced a chern-simons term with its coecient k proportional to

b. however, since the uv divergence usually emerges in a perturbative quantum correction,
one must rst choose a regularization scheme to make the theory well dened. it was shown
that the coecient of this radiatively induced chern-simons term is regularization dependent
[2, 8]. in pauli-villars regularization, this coecient is zero, while dimensional regularization
combined with the derivative expansion leads to a denite non-zero value [8]. it also seems
to us that this induced term cannot be observed by calculating the fermionic determinant
in fock-schwinger proper time method [10].
in particular, based on the hypothesis that
 = (x)5(x) should be gauge invariant at arbitrary four-
the axial vector current j5
momentum, coleman and glashow claimed that the k must be zero [11]. thus the existence
of this radiatively induced chern-simons term in perturbative theory is somehow ambiguous.
more recently, a new calculation was performed by jackiw and v.a. kostelecky [9], using
the b-exact propagator instead of the free fermionic propagator, in which the lorentz and
cpt violating fermionic term was treated non-perturbatively. it was shown that in this non-
perturbative approach the lorentz and cpt violating term is generated unambiguously at
low-energy. therefore, it is interesting to understand the discrepancies among these various
results within the framework of perturbative theory.

one possible way is utilizing an improved regularization scheme.

it is known that a
regularization is a temporary modication of the original theory. dierent regularization
schemes have actually provided dierent methods to calculate a quantum correction. thus
it is possible to incur a regularization dependent result. to avoid this occurrence, one should
choose a regularization scheme that modies the original theory as little as possible and pre-
serves the features of the original theory such as symmetries etc as much as possible. in view
of this criteria, dierential regularization seems to be the most appropriate candidate [12].
this regularization scheme is a relatively new calculation method and it works for an eu-
clidean eld theory in coordinate space. the invention of this regularization is based on
the observation that in coordinate space the uv divergence manifest itself in the singularity
preventing the amplitude from having a fourier transform into momentum space. so one
can regulate the amplitude by writing its singular term as the derivative of another less
singular function, which has a well dened fourier transform, then performing the fourier
transform and discarding the surface term. in this way one can directly get a renormalized
amplitude. up to now this method and its modied version have been applied success-
fully to almost every aspects of eld theories, including chiral anomaly, low-dimensional and
supersymmetric eld theories [1317]. one can easily see that this regularization method
actually has never introduced an regulator to modify the lagrangian of the original theory,
hence it does not pull the value of a primitively divergent feynman diagram away from its
singularity. in comparison with the usual route of calculating a quantum correction, this
method has actually skipped over the regularization procedure and straightforwardly yielded
the renormalized result. therefore, the quantum correction obtained in this regularization
method should be more reliable than any other regularization schemes and hence can provide
a better understanding to above ambiguity.

not only these favourable features, dierential regularization has another great advan-
tage over other regularization schemes. when implementing a dierential regularization on
a quantum amplitude, one can introduce a renormalization scale for each singular term.
these individual renormalization scales are not independent and the relations among them
can be xed by the symmetries of theory. in other words, the maintenance of the symmetries

2

in the theory such as gauge symmetry etc can be achieved by choosing the indenite renor-
malization scales at the nal stage of the calculation. as will be shown later, this special
feature of dierential regularization is not only the reason why the regularization ambiguity
can be explicitly parameterized by the ratio of two renormalization scales, but also provide
a guide for us to search for a natural setting to eliminate this ambiguity.

in view of this, in this paper we shall investigate this radiatively induced ambiguity in
terms of dierential regularization. the model we shall start from is quantum electrodynam-
ics with the inclusion of a lorentz- and cpt- violating axial vector term in the fermionic
sector [8, 9, 18],

lfermion =  (/  a/  b/5) ,

(1)
where b is a constant four-vector with a xed orientation in space-time. the term b/5 is
gauge invariant, but it explicitly violates lorentz- and cpt symmetries, since b picks up a
preferred direction in space-time. we will see that this lorentz- and cpt- violation in the
fermionic sector is the origin of the induced chern-simons term.

in ref. [9], it was found that the radiatively induced chern-simons term can arise in the
low-energy, or equivalently in the large fermionic mass limit. in principle, we can also utilize
the b-exact propagator in coordinate space to calculate the vacuum polarization tensor.
however, the existence of the b-term make it impossible to write out this b-exact propagator
in coordinate space, and hence one cannot proceed parallel to ref. [5] in coordinate space.
thus we have to adopt a free fermionic propagator. the feynman diagram that will be
calculated is the vacuum polarization tensor but with an insertion of a zero-momentum

composite operator r d4z b/5 in the internal fermionic line (fig.1), since only this kind of

diagram can give the lowest order contribution in b and hence possibly leads to the induced
chern-simons term. equivalently, this kind of feynman diagram can also be thought as
the triangle diagram composed of two vector currents and one axial vector currents but
with zero momentum transfer between the vector currents. in fact, the explicit calculation
in ref. [9] is very similar to that for the chiral anomaly, only the zero-momentum transfer
between two vector gauge eld vertices was achieved naturally due to the utilization of the
b-exact propagator. here we can also get a natural zero-momentum transfer by considering
above feynman diagrams.

we need the free fermionic propagator,

it is remarkable that this radiatively induced lagrangian has an ambiguity parameterized
by an indenite coecient ln m1/m2. this is just the case recently pointed out by jackiw
that the radiative correction is nite but undetermined [18].

the more interesting case is when the fermion is massive, where jackiw and kostelecky [9]
successfully escaped from the no-go theorem proposed by coleman and glashow [11] and
found the existence of the radiatively induced chern-simons term in a non-perturbative way,
so this case has a direct physical relevance. the corresponding vacuum polarization tensor

one natural way to perform the operation on (16) is to expand the term /xb(k1(mx)/x)
2/(xaxc)k0(mx), write its singular terms in a derivative form and then contract it with
-matrix trace. however, we have no way to realize this due to the diculty in solving a
dierential equation with the modied bessel function. neither can we do it for the terms
k1(mx)/x/xak0(mx) and k0(mx)/xak0(mx). therefore, in contrast to the massless
case, we shall rst carry out the trace calculation. making use of the techniques collected
in (b1)-(b4), we can work out above vacuum polarization tensor as follows,

obviously, due to the asymptotic expansion (3) the function [k1(mx)/x]2 is singular as x0
and has no fourier transform into the momentum space. it should be emphasized that in
deriving eqs.(b2)(b4) and (17) the substraction operation among the singular terms like
[k1(mx)/x]2 should not be naively carried out. it is analogous to the fact that in momentum
space two divergent terms with the same form but opposite sign cannot be canceled, until
after a regularization scheme is implemented so that they become well dened and the
substraction operation can work safely. otherwise, a nite term will probably be lost since
in general the dierence of two innite quantities is not zero. in fact, the operation keeping
the singular terms untouched before performing the regularization is a crucial point in the
dierential regularization method.

unfortunately, as above, due to the diculty in solving a dierential equation with
the modied bessel function, we still cannot write the singular function [k1(mx)/x]2 as
the derivative of another less singular function. however, we can consider the asymptotic
expansion (3). one can easily see that in eq.(17) the singularity at short-distance is only
carried by the leading term 1/x4, the other terms are nite and hence they are exactly
canceled. therefore, making use of eq.(10) again, we obtained the regulated form for the
vacuum polarization tensor in the massive case,

eq.(20) shows that the coecient of the induced chern-simons term has a nite ambigu-
ity, which was explicitly parameterized by the ratio of two renormalization scales, m1/m2.

7

especially, eq.(20) has contained all the results obtained in other regularization schemes.
for m1 = e1/4m2, we get the conclusion in pauli-villars regularization,

(p)|p2=0 = 0;

(21)

while if we choose m1 = e1/16m2, then the result in dimensional regularization [8] and the
non-perturbative approach [9] is reproduced,

(p)|p2=0 =

3
82 aipa.

(22)

it is remarkable that a natural choice m1 = m2 does not correspond to a subtraction in the
dispersive representation given in ref. [9].

the above conclusion is not strange to us and the profound reason lies in the excellent
features possessed by dierential regularization. as it is shown above, the basic operation
in dierential regularization is replacing a singular term by the derivative of another less
singular function. this operation has provided a possibility to add arbitrary local terms to
the higher order amplitude since we have to solve a dierential equation for non-coincident
points [19]. when performing such a operation, we are introducing a new arbitrary local term
into the quantum eective action. according to renormalization theory, the introduction of
an arbitrary local term into the amplitude of a green function is equivalent to the addition
of a nite counterterm to the lagrangian. therefore, from this viewpoint, dierential regu-
larization can lead to a more general quantum eective action than any other regularization
schemes. in particular, dierential regularization keeps all the ambiguities to the nal stage
of the calculation, and these ambiguities can only be xed by imposing some additional
physical requirements or resorting to some more fundamental principle. this special feature
presented by dierential regularization has formed a sharp contrast to other regularization
schemes such as dimensional, pauli-villars and cut-o regularization etc. these regular-
ization methods, together with the given renormalization prescription, can x the those
arbitrary terms automatically at the beginning. in dierent regularization schemes, these
local terms are dierent. this is the reason why dierent regularization schemes can induce
dierent chern-simons terms. it should be emphasized that no regularization can claim that
it gives the right value for this induced term. in dierential regularization, this ambiguity is
explicitly parameterized by the ratio of two indenite renormalization scales and the results
obtained in other regularization schemes can be reproduced by an appropriate choices on
this arbitrary ratio. therefore, one can say that dierential regularization has yielded a
more universal result than any other regularization method, since it does not impose any
preferred choice on the green function at the beginning.

in summary, we have investigated the lorentz- and cpt violating chern-simons term
induced by radiative corrections in dierential regularization. the ambiguous results ob-
tained in other regularization schemes are universally obtained. in particular, this ambiguity
is quantitively parameterized by the ratio of two renormalization scales. there exists no nat-
ural setting to eliminate this ambiguity within dierential regularization itself, unless some
physical requirements are imposed. for example, if one requires the lagrangian density
rather than the action to be gauge invariant, one must choose m1 = e1/4m2, and hence
the generated chern-simons term vanishes. another choice is, to require the action and
= 5 at zero momentum) to be gauge invariant,

 (i.e. the axial vector current j5

r d4xj5

as done by jackiw and kostelecky [9]. in this case, one must choose m1 = e1/16m2 and
consequently, the chern-simons term is generated unambiguously.

repeating the above operation on eq.(a9), we get
