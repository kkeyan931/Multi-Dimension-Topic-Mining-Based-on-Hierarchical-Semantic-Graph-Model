abstract

we compute two-point functions of chiral operators tr3 in n = 4 su (n ) supersymmetric
yang-mills theory to the order g4 in perturbation theory. we perform explicit calculations
using n = 1 superspace techniques and nd that perturbative corrections to the correlators
vanish for all n . while at order g2 the cancellations can be ascribed to the nonrenormalization
theorem valid for correlators of operators in the same multiplet as the stress tensor, at order
g4 this argument no longer applies and the actual cancellation occurs in a highly nontrivial
way. our result is obtained in complete generality, without the need of additional conjectures
or assumptions. it gives further support to the belief that such correlators are not renormalized
to all orders in g and to all orders in n .

1 introduction

recently much evidence has been provided in testing the conjectured equivalence of type
iib superstring theory on anti-de-sitter space (ads) times a compact manifold to the
n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills conformal eld theory living on the boundary,
in the large n limit and at large t hooft coupling  = g2n/4 (g2 being the yang-
mills coupling constant) [1]. according to this correspondence correlation functions of
operators in the conformal eld theory are mapped to appropriate on-shell amplitudes of
superstring theory in the bulk ads background. n = 4 chiral primary operators trk 
tr{{i1(z)i2(z)    ik}(z)}, in the symmetric, traceless representation of su(4), play
a special role in exploring non-perturbative statements concerning the above mentioned
connection. these are local operators of the lowest scaling dimension in a given irreducible
representation of the superconformal algebra su(2, 2|4), and belong to short multiplets
which are chiral under a n = 1 subalgebra.
in the large n limit they correspond to
kaluza klein modes in the ads supergravity sector. in the special case of k = 2, two-
and three-point correlators are given by their free-eld theory values for any nite n. in
this case their form, xed up to a constant by conformal invariance, is protected by a
nonrenormalization theorem [2] valid for two- and three-point functions of operators in
the same multiplet as the stress tensor.

for any strong-weak coupling duality test it is essential to have quantities that do
not acquire radiative corrections as one moves from weak to strong coupling. if an exact
computation in the supergravity sector shows agreement with a tree level result in the
yang-mills sector, then there is an indication of a nonrenormalization theorem at work.
this is the case for the threepoint correlators < trk1trk2trk3 > computed in ref. [3]
in the large n limit of n = 4 su(n) yang-mills: the strong limit result  = g2n/4  1
obtained using type iib supergravity was shown to agree with the weak t hooft coupling
limit  = g2n/4  1 in terms of free elds. according to the ads/cft correspondence
one concludes that the correlators are independent of  to leading order in n. a stronger
conjecture made in ref.
[3] claims that threepoint functions might be independent of
g for any value of n. as emphasized above, for the case k = 2 nonrenormalization
properties have been proven to be enjoyed by two and threepoint functions of chiral
operators. for general k there exists evidence of nonrenormalization based on proofs that
rely on reasonable assumptions (analyticity in harmonic superspace [4] and validity of a
generalized adler-bardeen theorem [5]).

explicit perturbative calculations in the n = 4 su(n) yang-mills conformal eld
theory are a way to conrm the conjectures and add insights into potential larger sym-
metries of the theory. important steps along this program have been made in [6, 7, 8, 9].
in particular it has been shown that to order g2 radiative corrections do not aect the
two- and three-point functions of chiral operators [6]. the two-point function calculation
has been performed for chiral operators with general k. the result has been obtained
showing that the order g2 contribution is proportional to the one for k = 2 which indeed
satises the known nonrenormalization theorem mentioned above. the method cannot
be extended to higher orders. in this paper we address the non trivial test left open at

1

order g4. we nd that corrections indeed vanish for all values of n, then supporting the
stronger conjecture of ref. [3].

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we briey illustrate the n = 4 theory
and give the relevant rules for calculating in n = 1 superspace. we present methods of
performing perturbation theory calculations which make higher-loop correlators tractable.
in section 3 we test our approach computing the order g4 contributions to the two-point
function with k = 2 and check that their sum vanishes as it should. this oers us the
opportunity to give details on the procedure, to collect results that are useful for the
subsequent calculation, to emphasize the points of interest on which we will focus in the
central part of the work. this is presented in the following section where the two-point
correlator with k = 3 is considered and the order g4 contributions are collected. the
appendices contain a complete list of our notations and details of the actual calculation.

2 the general set up

the physical particle content of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory is given by one
spin-1 yang-mills vector, four spin- 1
2 majorana spinors and six spin-0 particles in the 6 of
the rsymmetry group su(4). all particles are massless and transform under the adjoint
representation of the su(n) gauge group.

perturbative calculations are quite dicult to handle using a component eld formu-
lation of the theory. (note that in ref. [6] a component approach was used, but the order
g2 result for the two- and three-point correlators was obtained using a general argumen-
tation based on colour combinatorics. only a schematic knowledge of the structure of
the component action was required.) in general, in order to resum feynman diagrams at
higher-loop orders it is greatly advantageous to work in superspace.

in n = 1 superspace the action can be written in terms of one real vector supereld
v and three chiral superelds i containing the six scalars organized into the 3  3 of
su(3)  su(4) (we follow the notations in [10])

s[j, j] = z d8z tr(cid:16)egv iegv i(cid:17) +

(2.1)

where w = i d2(egv degv ), and v = v at a, i = a
i t a, t a being su(n) matrices
in the fundamental representation (see appendix a for a list of results on colour struc-
tures). we have added to the classical action source terms for the chiral primary operators
generically denoted by o since our goal is the computation of their correlators.

although in (2.1) the n = 4 supersymmetry invariance is realized only non linearly,
the main advantage oered by a n = 1 formulation of the theory resides in the fact that
a straightforward o-shell quantum formulation is available. thus if the aim is to perform

2

higher-loop perturbative calculations this is the most suited approach to follow. feynman
rules are by now standard and we have listed them in appendix b.

now we focus on the two-point super-correlator for the operator o = tr({ijk}). as
in ref. [6], we consider the su(3) highest weight 1 eld and compute < tr(1)3tr( 1)3 >.
this is not a restrictive choice since all the other primary chiral correlators can be ob-
tained from this one by su(3) transformations. what we gain is that we have no avour
combinatorics and we are left to deal with the colour combinatorics only.
we work in euclidean space, with the generating functional dened as

w [j, j] = z d d  dv es[j, j]

thus the two-point function is given by

< tr(1)3(z1)tr( 1)3(z2) >=

(2.2)

(2.3)

2w

j(z1) j(z2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)j= j=0

where z  (x, , ). we use perturbation theory to evaluate the contributions to w [j, j]
which are quadratic in the sources, i.e.

w [j, j]  z d4x1 d4x2 d4 j(x1, , )

f (g2, n)
(x1  x2)6

j(x2, , )

(2.4)

where the x-dependence of the result is xed by the conformal invariance of the theory,
and f (g2, n) is the function that we want to determine up to order g4. we will nd a
result valid for any n.

in order to perform the calculation we have found it convenient to work in momentum
space, using dimensional regularization and minimal subtraction scheme. in n dimensions,
with n = 4  2, the fourier transform of the power factor (x1  x2)6 in (2.4) is given
by (see (b.3))

the presence of the singular factor (1  )  1
 signals, in momentum space and in di-
mensional regularization, the uv divergence of the correlation function in (2.4) associated
to the shortdistance behaviour for x1  x2. it follows that performing perturbative cal-
culations in momentum space it is sucient to look for all the contributions to (2.4) that
behave like 1/, therefore disregarding nite contributions. in fact, once the divergent
terms are determined at a given order in g, using (2.5) one can reconstruct an xspace
structure as in (2.4) with a nonvanishing contribution to f (g2, n). finite contributions
in momentum space would correspond in xspace to terms proportional to  which give
rise only to contact terms [11].

the one stated above is the basic rule of our strategy that we can summarize as follows:

 consider all the two-point diagrams from w [j, j] with j and j on the external legs,

3

 evaluate all factors coming from combinatorics of the diagram and compute the

colour structure using the formulae collected in appendix a,

 perform the superspace d-algebra following standard techniques,

 reduce the result to a multi-loop momentum integral,

 compute its 1/ divergent contribution.

this last step, i.e. the calculation of the divergent part of the various integrals we have
achieved using the method of uniqueness [12] and various rules and identities [11, 13]
that we have collected in appendix b. since the theory is at its conformal point, it is
not aected by ir divergences. therefore, even if we work in a massless regularization
scheme, we never worry about the ir behavior of our integrals. moreover, since the
theory is nite, the diagrams that we consider do not possess uv divergent subdiagrams.
finally, as a general remark we observe that gauge-xing the classical action requires the
introduction of corresponding yang-mills ghosts. however they only couple to the vector
multiplet and do not enter our specic calculation.

in the next section, in order to get familiar with the formalism and to check its validity,
we present the order g4 calculation of the two-point correlator with k = 2, a non trivial
test of our techniques.

3 preliminary test:< tr(1)2tr( 1)2 > to order g4
the two-point correlator we are interested in is obtained from w [j, j] inserting in the
action (2.1) the chiral operators o = tr(1)2 and o = tr( 1)2. as outlined in the
previous section, the relevant contribution is obtained from the generating functional
isolating terms of the form

w [j, j]  z d4x1 d4x2 d4 j(x1, , )

e(g2, n)
(x1  x2)4

j(x2, , )

(3.1)

the general form of (3.1) is xed by conformal invariance, while the function e(g2, n) is
the unknown to be determined. fourier transforming from x-space to momentum space

figure 2: g2order contribution to < tr(1)2tr( 1)2 >

the order g2 contribution, once evaluated in superspace gives immediately a zero
result: the diagrams one would need to consider are shown in fig. 2. diagram 2a does
not contribute since the one-loop correction to the chiral propagator vanishes due to a
complete cancellation between vector and chiral loops [14]. diagram 2b, after completion
of the d-algebra leads to a nite momentum integral (see eq. (b.5)).

now we consider the order g4 contributions: they are shown in fig. 3. in fig. 3a we

note that a diagram with a vector propagator corrected at order g2 is absent since at one
loop order there is a complete cancellation among chiral, vector and ghost contributions
[14].

a straightforward computation of the d-algebra for the diagrams in fig. 3c, 3d, 3e
allows to conclude that the corresponding momentum integrals are actually all nite and,
as previously observed, not relevant for our purpose. more precisely we have for the
diagrams in fig. 3c, 3d

the above integrals are nite by power counting. in general we can disregard all the terms
that in the course of the d-algebra end up with spinor derivatives d or d acting on the

6

external legs: the resulting momentum integrals are nite and not interesting. keeping
this rule in mind the evaluation of the remaining diagrams is greatly simplied.

the graph in fig. 3a is easy to compute. using the result in (3.5) and the oneloop

integrals listed in appendix b, with an overall factor

quantity we have

it is a trivial matter to sum up the contributions listed in (3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13) and
obtain a vanishing result, as expected from the nonrenormalization theorem.

before closing this section we note that the diagrams in figs. 3f and 3g lead to planar
contributions (i.e. with exactly the same n dependence from colour combinatorics as the
other diagrams): indeed to this order nonplanar diagrams are absent. in the next section
we will be confronted with a more complicated situation.

4 the main calculation: < tr(1)3tr( 1)3 > to order g4

now we present the computation of the two-point function for the chiral operator o =
tr(1)3. to this end we go back to (2.4) and compute the perturbative contributions to

7

the function f (g2, n). as previously emphasized, making use of (2.5) we write feynman
diagrams in momentum space and isolate the 1/ poles.

the superspace diagrams that enter the order g2 computation are shown in fig. 5.
they are nothing else than the ones that appear in fig. 2 with one line added from the
chiral external vertices. one proves that their contributions vanish with exactly the same
reasoning outlined in the previous section. as found in ref. [6] to order g2 the vanishing
of the correlator is due to the fact that it is proportional to the correlator of o = tr(1)2
for which the nonrenormalization theorem is valid. however, this is no longer true at
order g4 to which we turn now.

figure 6: g4order contribution to < tr(1)3tr( 1)3 >

the diagrams contributing to g4order are collected in fig. 6. the ones in fig. 6a6g
are the same as in fig. 3 with one extra line added from the chiral external vertices.
from the result obtained in the previous case at order g4 (see section 3), we would be
tempted to believe that these diagrams still sum up to zero. however this would be a
wrong conclusion. in fact, what makes things dierent is that in 6f and 6g the addition
of the extra line changes completely the topology of the diagrams which become really
nonplanar. as a consequence, their colour combinatorics changes and their n-dependence
is distinct from the remaining planar diagrams 6a 6e. more specically, in this case it
turns out that the nonplanar diagrams 6f and 6g lead to a vanishing colour combinatorics
factor (the details of the calculation are given in appendix a).

the evaluation of the colour coecient for the other nonplanar diagram in fig. 6h
reveals again a vanishing contribution (see appendix a for details). the fact that the
nonplanar diagrams do not contribute indicates that the nal answer is going to be valid
for all values of n, independently of any large n limit. in light of this result it becomes
challenging to prove the cancellation of nonplanar diagrams to all orders in the yang-mills

9

coupling.

going back to fig. 6, one easily convinces oneself that for the graphs in fig. 6c, 6d, 6e
the same analysis as in the previous section applies. in this case the addition of the chiral
line simply adds a d2 d2 factor which accounts for the d-algebra of one added loop;
performing the d-algebra in the diagrams one is left with nite integrals. more precisely
we obtain for the diagrams in fig. 6c, 6d

where a and b are nite constants, as a consequence of the results in (3.7) and (3.8).
the nal s-integration can be performed using (b.8) and a complete nite result is ob-
tained in both cases (4.3) and (4.4). thus these terms are not relevant and we dismiss
them. we note that at this order diagrams containing the scalar superpotential vertex
ijktr(i[j, k]) do not contribute.

we are left with the contributions from fig. 6a, 6b, 6i, 6j that we analyze one by one.

we will nd that a highly nontrivial cancellation occurs.

for every diagram we need compute the specic combinatorics, the various factors
from vertices and propagators and the colour structure. then we have to perform the
d-algebra in the loops and nally evaluate the momentum integrals. we factorize for
each contribution the same quantity

at this point it is simple to add the four contributions in (4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 4.21) and check the
complete cancellation of the 1/ terms. it is interesting to note that, while the diagrams
6a, 6b only contribute with a divergent term proportional to (3) and the diagram 6i
gives only a (5)term, from the diagram 6j both terms arise with the correct coecients
to cancel completely the divergence.

5 conclusions

we have computed perturbatively up to g4order the two point correlation function for the
chiral primary operator tr3
1 in n = 4 su(n) sym theory. we have found a complete
cancellation of quantum corrections for any nite n. our result represents the rst o(g4)
direct check of the nonrenormalization theorem conjectured on the basis of the ads/cft
correspondence [3]. it supports also the stronger claim [3] that there might be no quantum
corrections at all, for any nite n.

we have performed the calculation in n = 1 superspace using dimensional regular-
ization. the loopintegrals have been evaluated in momentum space with the method
of uniqueness [12, 13]. in momentum space nontrivial, potential contributions appear as
local divergent terms that are easily isolated and evaluated. finite contributions would
correspond to contact terms and can be neglected.

12

our procedure is applicable to the perturbative analysis of more complicated cases.
twopoint functions for trk, k > 3, threepoint functions and extremal correlators for
chiral primary operators are now under investigation.

a colour conventions and relevant identities

in this appendix we give our conventions and list a set of colour structure identities that
we have used in the course of the calculation. in addition we evaluate explicitly the colour
coecients for the g4order nonplanar diagrams in figs. 6f , 6g and 6h.

the su(n) generators {ta}, a = 1,    , n 2  1, satisfy the algebra

[ta, tb] = ifabctc

(a.1)

where fabc are the structure constants. in the fundamental representation they are given
by n  n traceless matrices satisfying

tr(tatb) = k2 ab

(a.2)

here k2 is an arbitrary constant (usually k2 = 1
2) which can be eliminated by a suitable
rescaling of the tamatrices and the structure constants. we leave it unspecied, since in
the evaluation of correlation functions it only appears at an intermediate stage, the nal
answer being independent of k2.

the anticommutator of two generators denes a totally symmetric tensor dabc, accord-

ing to the relation

{ta, tb} = 2k2(cid:18) 1

now, using the previous denitions and the relation

finally, from jacobi identity one derives

(a.15)

now we concentrate on the evaluation of the colour coecients for the diagrams 6f

and 6g. the colour structure arising from these diagrams is

c  [tr(tatbtc) + tr(tatctb)] famnfenpfbprfdrm [tr(tdtetc) + tr(tdtcte)]

using the identities (a.6) and (a.14) the previous expression can be rewritten as

(a.18)

finally, we prove the vanishing of the colour coecient for the nonplanar diagram 6h.
the colour structure for this diagram is

[tr(tatbtc) + tr(tatctb)] famdfbnefcpgfmnp [tr(tdtetg) + tr(tdtgte)]

(a.19)

this expression is trivially zero since the product of the four structure constants is an-
tisymmetric under the exchange a  b and d  e, whereas the rest of the expression is
symmetric. however, a stronger result holds which states the vanishing of (a.19) without
exploiting any symmetry of the expression. let us concentrate, for example, on the rst
piece

tr(tatbtc)famdfbnefcpgfmnp tr(tdtetg).

(a.20)

by means of the jacobi identity (a.15) applied to the product fcpgfmnp, this expression
can be easily rewritten as

tr(tatbtc) [fbnefcnpfdmafgmp + famdfcmpfenbfgnp] tr(tdtetg)

= k2

2n 2[tr(tatetp)tr(tatetp) + tr(tdtbtp)tr(tdtbtp)] = 0

(a.21)

where the identity (a.11) has been used. analogous cancellations occur for the other
three pieces of the sum in (a.19).

b conventions and details of the calculation in mo-

mentum space

the quantization procedure of the classical action in (2.1) requires the introduction of
a gauge xing and corresponding ghost terms. we have found it convenient to work in
feynman gauge, so that the vector and the chiral supereld propagators are treated on
the equal footing. here we do not repeat the various steps that lead to the construction
of the quantum action (see for example [10]); we simply give the essential ingredients.
the ghost superelds only couple to the vector multiplet and are not interesting for our
calculation. the relevant interactions are the ones in (2.1). in momentum space we have
the supereld propagators

< v av b >=

(b.1)

the vertices are read directly from the interaction terms in (2.1), with additional d2, d2
factors for chiral, antichiral lines respectively. the ones that we need are the following

v1 = igk2fabcij a

v2 =

and perform the calculation in momentum space. the various integrals we have to deal
with are all computed making use of the method of uniqueness [12]. this approach, which
consists in an analytical calculation of multiloop feynman diagrams, is particularly e-
cient for massless feynman integrals of a single variable (either momentum or coordinate).
since we are evaluating a twopoint correlator with elds that are all massless, we are
just there where the method best applies.

at intermediate stages of the calculation we drop 2 factors and reinstate them at
the end, multiplying the nal result by a 1/(4)2 factor for every loop. with this under-
standing we give some of the integrals that we made use of:
at one loop
