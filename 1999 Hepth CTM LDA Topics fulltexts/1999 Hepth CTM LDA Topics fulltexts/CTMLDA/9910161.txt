(39) riemann tensor calculated metric expansion powers starting quadratic terms. therefore riemann tensor com- ponents order 4/3 equations motion relating einstein tensor square g satised order 2/3 (it similar situation ). metric (39) may depend time preserving 4 supersymmetry charges corresponding n = 1 supersymmetry = 4 (this similar 8 anti de sitter space supersymmetry preserved although metric depends spatial coordinates). fact extremely important since preserved supersymmetry given background (with globally well dened elds) guarantees background satises 11dimensional equations motion. thus, solution described paper rst approximation (in 2/3 expansion) timedependent solutions mtheory rst example solution. since 4dimensional supersymmetry preserved one able identify appropriate 4dimensional gravitino eld. could done using methods ref.  generalized time dependent case. metric (39) known linear approximation only, cannot make denite statements global behaviour solution time i.e. whether inationary-like solution power-like one anything else. similar problem exists already case x11 dependence. also know metric linear approximation, problem global behaviour less severe length x11 interval nite (although large). one may note presence nonzero gt11ab may important stems fact contribution cosmological constant problem. components vacuum energy opposite sign compared contribution components g present static solution. extend validity metric (39) arbitrary time derive rather suprising lower bound value gt11ab. argument goes follows. one see speed light x11 direction given v2 11 = 1 + x11 1 2t .
