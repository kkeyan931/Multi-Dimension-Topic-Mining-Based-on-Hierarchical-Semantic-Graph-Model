bianchi type i and type ix (mixmaster) geometries are investigated

within the framework of horava-witten cosmology. we consider the models

for which the fth coordinate is a s1/z2 orbifold while the four coordinates are

such that the 3-space is homogeneous and has geometry of bianchi type i or

ix while the rest six dimensions have already been compactied on a calabi-

yau space.

in particular, we study kasner-type solutions of the bianchi i

eld equations and discuss kasner asymptotics of bianchi ix eld equations.

we are able to recover the isotropic 3-space solutions found by lukas et al

[10]. finally, we discuss if such bianchi ix conguration can result in chaotic

behaviour of these horava-witten cosmologies.

string cosmology has attracted a lot of interest recently (for a review see [1]), especially

in the context of duality symmetry, which is a striking feature of the underlying string

theory and justies a kinetic-energy-driven ination, known as pre-big-bang ination [2].

pre-big-bang ination is the result of the admission of the cosmological solutions for bosonic

low-energy-eective-action for strings [3]. bosonic action is the simplest stringy action and

in view of duality symmetry this action together with other superstring actions are not

necessarily the right description of physics at strong coupling - m-theory. horava and

witten [4] proposed that the right candidate for m-theory is strongly coupled limit of e8e8
heterotic superstring theory compactied on a s1/z2 orbifold with e8 gauge elds on each

orbifold xed plane. this means the gauge elds live on 10-dimensional planes while gravity

can propagate in the whole 11-dimensional bulk. the idea of having extra dimensions in

which only gravity can propagate has been under intensive studies recently and dierent

scenarios (including extra time dimensions [9]) have been considered [58].

in this paper we will consider the models in which m-theory is compactied on an orbifold

and then reduced to four dimensions using calabi-yau manifold [10,11]. since the size of

the orbifold is bigger than the size of the calabi-yau space then there was a period in the

history of the universe during which the universe was ve-dimensional. that means we

can consider the cosmological models for which the fth coordinate is an orbifold while the

remaining four coordinates are such that the three-space is homogeneous with bianchi type

i or ix geometry. the main objective is to study kasner-type solutions of bianchi type i

eld equations and kasner asymptotic states (as a result of kasner-to-kasner transitions)

of bianchi type ix eld equations. the form of these solutions allows us to nd out whether

there is a possibility for chaotic behaviour in these horava-witten cosmologies. similar

question was addressed in [12] for pre-big-bang cosmology with the answer that only nite

number of chaotic oscillations are possible.

it is well known that the vacuum bix homogeneous cosmology in general relativity is

chaotic [13]. an innite number of oscillations of the orthogonal scale factors occurs in

general on any nite interval of proper time including the singularity at t = 0.

if a minimally coupled, massless scalar eld (e.g. the inaton) is admitted, the situation

changes. only a nite number of spacetime oscillations can occur before the evolution is

changed into a state in which all directions shrink monotonically to zero as the curvature

singularity is reached and the oscillatory behaviour ceases [14]. this is also the case in 4-

dimensional pre-big-bang cosmology where the role of a scalar eld is played by the dilaton

[12]. on the other hand, 5-dimensional vacuum einstein solutions of bianchi type ix do not

allow chaos to occur either [1517]. the point is that the fth dimension plays eectively

the role of a scalar eld in scalar eld cosmologies and stops chaotic oscillations.

in 5-

dimensional horava-witten cosmology the situation is in some ways analogous to both of

the above cases which gives some new interesting points to be made and this is the task of

our paper.

the horava-witten eld equations are given by [4,10,11]

where  = 1//2 ln v and v is a scalar eld measuring the deformation of the calabi-yau

space, g is the ve dimensional metric tensor while gij is the four dimensional metric

which denotes the pull-back of the metric on ve-dimensional manifold m5 onto the orbifold

xed four-dimensional manifolds m (1)

4

and m (2)
4 .

in (1)-(2) we have neglected the terms

which come from the three-form on the calabi-yau space. actually, they will not make any

qualitative change in our discussion - this is on the same footing as it was the case in pre-

big-bang models [12]. in (1)-(2) y  [, ] is a coordinate in the orbifold direction and
the orbifold xed planes are at y = 0, . z2 acts on s1 by y  y. the terms involving
delta functions arise from the stress energy on the boundary planes.

following [10] we consider cosmological models of the form

ds2

5 = n 2(, y)d 2 + ds2

3 + d2(, y)dy2,

(3)

where

ds2

3 = a2(, y)(1)2 + b2(, y)(2)2 + c2(, y)(3)2,

(4)

is a homogeneous bianchi type ix 3-metric and the orthonormal forms 1, 2, 3 are given

by

1 = cos d + sin  sin d,

2 = sin d  cos  sin d,
3 = d + cos d,

and the angular coordinates , ,  span the following ranges,

0    4,

0    ,

0    2.

similarly as in [10,11] we will look for separable solutions of the form

n(, y) = n( )a(y),

a(, y) = ( )a(y),

b(, y) = ( )a(y),

c(, y) = ( )a(y),

d(, y) = ( )a(y),

v (, y) = ( )a(y), .

with respect to time  and a prime means a derivative with respect to an orbifold coordinate

which, except for the right-hand side of eq.(16), is the same set as the set of equations (3.7)-

(3.11) of [12] for bosonic low-energy-eective-action cosmology in string frame, provided we

1this, of course, reduces the generality of our discussion in the context of [17] since we identify

an extra dimension with a scalar eld.

take dilaton eld  as dened in [12] to be equal to ( ln ) and also neglect axion (i.e. take
a = 0 in ref. [12]).

a new time coordinate is introduced to simplify the eld equations by (compare eq.

(3.12) of [12])

d =

d



.

(21)

from now on we will use the notation (...), = d/d. to further simplify the equations we

additionally dene

 = ln 

 = ln 

 = ln 

 = ln ,

(22)

so that the set of equations (16)-(20) reads as

 4(cid:21) 2,
 4(cid:21) 2,
 4(cid:21) 2,

 = 0.

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

these equations are the same as pre-big-bang cosmology mixmaster equations in string
frame (3.19)-(3.22) of ref. [12] if we take  =  = m+const or as 5-dimensional vacuum
mixmaster equations (31)-(32) of ref. [17].

now we consider suitable initial conditions expressed in terms of the kasner parameters

and discuss the general behaviour of bianchi type ix horava-witten cosmology on the

approach to singularity.

the kasner solutions are obtained as approximate solutions of the equations (16)-(20)

when the right-hand sides (describing the curvature anisotropies) are neglected. in terms of

 -time, they are

 = 0 p1,

while

 = 0 p2,

 = 0 p3,

 = 0 p4,

 =  ln 0  p4 ln .

(28)

(29)

from (23)-(27) we have the following algebraic conditions for the kasner indices, pi :

p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 = 1,

and

1 + p2
p2

2 + p2

3 +

3
2

p2
4 = 1.

(30)

(31)

this, in particular, proves that the isotropic friedmann case as obtained by lukas et al.

[10] is given by

p1 = p2 = p3 = p =

4

3
11 
2
11 

,
113
43
11

p4 = q =

.

(32)

(33)

the meaning of such isotropic solutions was discussed in ref. [10] (note that numerically

p+ = 0.48, p = 0.06 and q = 0.45, q+ = 0.81). in fact, there are two branches each
one for negative and positive values of time coordinate  (negative values of time can be

achieved by taking  instead of + in (28), or, simply by taking the modulus). if  < 0
one has () branch and if  > 0 one has (+) branch. for () branch both the vorldvolume
(of 3-dimensional space) and the orbifold contract for p and q+ while the worldvolume
contracts and the orbifold expands (superinationary) for p+ and q. for (+) branch the
worldvolume and the orbifold expand for p and q+ while the wordvolume expands and the
orbifold contracts for p+ and q.

notice that the conditions (30)-(31) are dierent from the conditions which emerge

in pre-big-bang cosmology where the role of the fth coordinate is played by the dilaton

(see eqs.(3.50)-(3.51) of [12]). they are also dierent from mixmaster kaluza-klein ve-

dimensional models where the homogeneity group acts on four-dimensional hypersurfaces

of constant time (see eq.(33) of [17]). the reason for that is simply the fact the fth

coordinate in horava-witten cosmology is an orbifold. the isotropization of the models

under consideration means that the kasner indices reach the values (32)-(33). finally, the

isotropization of 5-dimensional kaluza-klein models in supergravity as rst considered by

chodos and detweiler [18] would require the dierent values of the kasner indices namely

p1 = p2 = p3 = p4 = 1/2 which fulll the conditions (30) and (31) without a factor 3/2 in
front of p4 in (31).

having given the conditions (30)-(31), one can express the indices p2 and p3 by using p1

and p4, i.e.,

p2 =

p3 =

1

2 (cid:20)(1  p1  p4) q3p2
2 (cid:20)(1  p1  p4) +q3p2

1

1 + 2p1 (1  p4) + 1 + 2p4 (1  2p4)(cid:21) ,
1 + 2p1 (1  p4) + 1 + 2p4 (1  2p4)(cid:21) .

(34)

since the expression under the square root in (34) should be nonnegative, one can extract

the restriction on the permissible values of p4 which is

q  p4  q+.

(35)

some particular choices are of interest. if one takes p4 = 0 one recovers vacuum general

relativity limit with kasner indices 1/3  p1  0, 0  p2  2/3, 2/3  p3  1. the range
dividing case is for p4 = 2/11 with the following ordering of the kasner indices

however, we are interested in knowing whether the curvature terms on the right-hand

side of the eld equations (24)-(26) really increase as    (  0 - approach to
singularity for (+) branch) since from (21) and (28) we get

 = 0 + ln ,

(37)

and 0 = const. this would require either 42, 42, or 42 to increase if the transition to

another kasner epoch is to occur [17,16]. since

42   (2p1+p4) =  (1+p1p2p3),
42   (2p2+p4) =  (1+p2p3p1),
42   (2p3+p4) =  (1+p3p1p2),

we need one of the following three conditions to be fullled

2p1 + p4 = 1 + p1  p2  p3 < 0,
2p2 + p4 = 1 + p2  p3  p1 < 0,
2p3 + p4 = 1 + p3  p1  p2 < 0.

(38)

(39)

from kasner conditions (30)-(31) we are free to choose only two parameters so that we

can write

p4 = 1  p1  p2  p3,
(1  p1  p2) 
p3 =

5 h4(cid:16)p2

1 + p2

2(cid:17)  3p1p2 + 3p1 + 3p2 + 1i

which gives also the condition for p3 to be real as follows

1  4(cid:16)p2

1 + p2

2(cid:17)  3p1p2 + 3p1 + 3p2  0.

1

2 ,

(40)

(41)

in (40) we take the + sign for p4 < 2/11 and the  sign for p4 > 2/11. the conditions (39)
become (compare [?])

4p2

1 + 4p2
p2

1 + p2

2  p1p2 + p2  p1 < 0,
2  p1p2 + p1  p2 < 0,
2(cid:17) + 7p1p2  7 (p1 + p2) + 3 > 0.

1 + p2

4(cid:16)p2

(42)

one should remind here that for (-) branch we have to take ( ) in (28), (29) and (38)

which leads to the same conditions (42).

the plot of the conditions (41)-(42) is given in fig.1. the chaotic oscillations (kasner-

to-kasner transitions) can start in any region except the narrow range surrounding the

isotropic points p1 = p2 = p+(q = q) and p1 = p2 = p(q = q+). however, such chaotic
oscillations would continue indenitely provided there were no such regions at all (this is

the case of vacuum general relativity, for example). here, once the kasner parameters fall

into the region surrounding the isotropic friedmann p+ or p solutions of lukas et al. [10]
the chaotic oscillations cease so that there is no chaos in such horava-witten cosmologies.

fig. 1. the range of kasner indices p1 and p2 which fulll the conditions (41)-(42). the

appearance of the isotropic friedmann cases at p1 = p2 = p and p1 = p2 = p+ prevents chaotic
oscillations in the shaded region that surrounds them. for the values of kasner indices p1 and p2

from that region chaotic oscillations are not possible to begin. on the other hand, even if after

some number of oscillations from one kasner epoch to the other, the values of p1 and p2 will fall into

that region, the chaotic oscillations of the scale factors stop which reects nonchaotic behaviour of

such bianchi ix horava-witten cosmologies.
