abstract

an expression for the curvature of the covariant determinant line
bundle is given in even dimensional space-time. the usefulness is guar-
anteed by its prediction of the covariant anomaly and schwinger term.
it allows a parallel derivation of the consistent anomaly and schwinger
term, and their covariant counterparts, which claries the similarities
and dierences between them.
in particular, it becomes clear that in
contrary to the case for anomalies, the dierence between the consistent
and covariant schwinger term can not be extended to a local form on the
space of gauge potentials.

1

introduction

although the consistent and covariant (chiral) anomaly have many similar fea-
tures, they also dier in many ways. for example, the consistent anomaly is
commonly derived from a variation of the eective action while the covariant
anomaly often is determined by the covariant current, dened from the consis-
tent current by addition of a local term, [1]. another example is provided by
the descent equations, a set of equations from which the consistent anomaly
and schwinger term not only can be calculated, by their cohomological meaning
is also determined. various attempts, for example [2, 3, 4], has been made to
create interesting cohomology classes and descent equations for the covariant
anomaly (and schwinger term, [5]), however, their physical meaning is unclear.
despite these dierences, we will show that it is anyway possible to treat
the consistent and covariant formalism from a common setting. the advantage
of doing so is that the origin of their dierences will be illuminated. further,
it allows as simple derivation of the covariant anomaly and schwinger term as
for their consistent counterparts. the results turn out to agree with the ones
found in the literature, see for example [1, 6, 7] for the covariant anomaly and

1

2

[8, 9, 10] for the covariant schwinger term.

following fujikawa [6], the covariant anomaly can be obtained from an eec-
tive action that has been renormalized covariantly, in contrary to the renormal-
ization leading to the consistent anomaly, see [11] for instance. this suggests
that the covariant anomaly can be obtained from the transgression of the cur-
vature on a covariant determinant line bundle. we will show that this indeed
is possible. the justication of our choice of line bundle is given by the pre-
diction of the covariant schwinger term as well. it will become clear that the
dierence between the consistent and covariant anomaly can be extended from
gauge orbits to a local form on the space of gauge connections, while this is not
true for the dierence between the consistent and covariant schwinger term.

the paper is organized as follows. to set notations and explain basic ideas,
the consistent anomaly and schwinger term will be derived and considered in
section (2). in section (3) a parallel treatment will be performed for the co-
variant anomaly and schwinger term. the similarities and dierences between
the consistent and covariant formalism will be discussed in section (4). all
these sections deal with yang-mills theory and explicit results for lower dimen-
sions will be given in section (5). to explain the modication to other kinds
of anomalies and schwinger terms, the case of dieomorphisms will also be
considered in this section.

2 derivation and interpretation of the consis-

tent anomaly and schwinger term

let m denote the space-time. it is assumed to be a compact oriented (2n  2)-
dimensional riemannian spin manifold without boundary. consider the princi-
pal bundle p = p (m, g), where the gauge group g is assumed to be a compact
semi-simple lie group. for simplicity, only the case when p is trivial will be
considered. gauge potentials are connections on p and can be considered
as local one-forms a on m with values in lieg. gauge transformations are
automorphisms on p that projects to the identity map on m . they can be
considered as local functions g on m taking values in g and obeying suitable
gluing properties. there is a free action of the group of (base-point preserving)
gauge transformation g on the ane space of gauge potentials a given by:

a 7 a  g = g1ag + g1dg a  a, g  g,

(1)

where d is the exterior derivative in m . this action induces a bre bundle
structure  : a  a/g. further, to each a  a there is associated a dirac
operator /a : (m, s+  e)  (m, s+  e), where s are the positive and
negative chirality part of the spin bundle over m and e is an associated bundle

to p . in local coordinates:

/a =

x=1

 ( +  + a)(cid:18) 1 + 5

(2)

they satisfy the covariance relation /ag = g1/ag.

the eective action can be described as a section of a determinant line
bundle l over a. associated with the quillen metric in l is a natural curvature
f2. it has been calculated in ref. [12]:

f2( f n) =zm

p (cid:16) f n(cid:17)(2n2,2)

(3)

the bigrading (i, j) means the part in the expansion of the expression that is an
i-form on m and a j-form on a. p denotes a symmetric invariant polynomial
[13] (for example, the symmetrized trace in the bre of e) and f = (d+da) a+
a2, where da is the exterior dierential in a and a(,  ) = a() + a( )(p),
where (,  )  tpp  taa and a is a connection on a  a/g. an explicit
example is given by aa = (d

which is recognized as the (non-integrated) consistent anomaly, see for instance
[13]. the notation  means that we have equality only up to exact forms on
m (such forms do not contribute when integrating over m ). the bigrading
that has been used here is with respect to the form degree in m and the ghost
degree, respectively.

before going into a discussion concerning the meaning of the derivation
above, we will explain how the consistent schwinger term can be obtained.
for this, we assume that m has a non-empty boundary m , which will be
interpreted as the physical space. we will consider the correspondence of eq.
(3) in this case. the operator /a will then induce self-adjoint dirac operators
/
a on the m which have to be restricted to certain boundary conditions. this
is in analog to the case when considering the index theorem for manifolds with
boundary, or the corresponding family index theorem. according to [16], eq.
(3) becomes now:

f2( f n) =zm

p (cid:16) f n(cid:17)(2n2,2)

+ .

(10)

the  form accounts for the boundary conditions while the rst term is inde-
pendent of these. it is important to remember that eq. (10) does not hold over

all of a, but only on a subset u = {a  a;  | spec(cid:0)/

(2n  3)-dimensional manifold m have the same properties as m and consider
the space a of gauge potentials on m , the corresponding group g of gauge
transformations, the brs operator  and the ghost v. let q : a  a be a
map which extends a gauge potential on the boundary to the whole manifold
m . the existence of such a map is clear if the structure is of product type
close to m , see [17]. if eq. (10) is restricted to q(u 
 ) and pulled-backed by
q, we obtain

there exists an action of g on l that projects to the action of g on a. indeed,
these statements are all true since f2, ver. = 0 is a consequence of the russian
formula (this in turn is a consequence of the covariance property satised by
the dirac operator in (2)). the existence of an action of g on l makes it possi-
ble to consider the line bundle l/g  a/g. many authors prefer to work with
l/g, however we will restrict to consider l since it is only on a that a parallel

which maps the curvature of l to the cohomology class of the consistent
anomaly. we will refer to this map as the transgression map. by abuse of
2n2 the transgression map,
keeping in mind that it is only well dened up to coboundaries. one advantage
of working on a/g is now clear: since f2, ver. = 0, the push-forward f2
can be constructed. it is the curvature on l/g. in terms of it, transgression
induces a homomorphism from h 2(a/g) to h 1

loc.(lieg) according to

[f2]  [zm

2n2].

(15)

as we will see in the next section, a corresponding homomorphism does not
exist for the covariant anomaly.

there is a bijective correspondence between connections  on l and con-
nection 1-forms al on l (=l \ s0, where s0 is the zero section of l). it
is given by the claim that s = sal  s should hold for any locally de-
ned section s of l. from this it is seen that the curvature f2 locally
can be written as da ((s) /s), where s is a locally dened non-vanishing
section of the line bundle l with connection . eq. (6) then implies that

rm 2n1( a, f ) = s/s + da, for some function  on a. a change of

section s = s exp() gives:

thus, the consistent anomaly is given by the 1-form (ver.s)/s identied with
a local form with 1 ghost. notice that a change of section s = s exp(loc.),
where loc. is a a local form with no ghosts, gives a change in the consistent
anomaly by a coboundary loc. and leaves therefore the cohomology class of
the consistent anomaly unchanged. conversely, it is clear that for every change
in the representative of the cohomology class, it is possible to multiply s with
the exponent of a local form so that (16) still holds. a section s is said to be
lieg-equivariant if ver.,xa s = s, x  lieg, where xa = d

thus, the cohomology class of the consistent anomaly is the obstruction in

schwinger term denes an element in h 2

transgression map, dened in (14), to a map

similar to the case for the consistent anomaly, this induces a homomorphism
loc.(lieg ) that maps [f3] to the right hand side of
from h 3(a /g) to h 2
(17). observe that the cocycle relation is equivalent with f3, ver. = 0.

the consistent schwinger term was obtained by writing f2 as a space-time
(without boundary) integral of a form and considering the corresponding ex-
pression when space-time has a boundary. this gives an expression containing
two terms, see eq. (10). the rst term is the one obtained if we naively let
space-time have a boundary in the formula for f2. the second term accounts
for the boundary conditions that the induced dirac operators on the boundary
have to fulll. since the integrand in the rst term only depends on the intrin-
sic properties of m , we will refer to this term as the intrinsic part. thus, the
consistent schwinger term is obtained by replacing the boundary-less space-
time in the formula for f2 with a space-time with boundary, keeping only the
intrinsic part, pull-back by q and restricting to vertical vectors. remember
that f2 is the curvature on l, the line bundle on which the eective action is
described by a section. since the second term in (11) vanishes when restricted
to vertical vectors, the consistent schwinger term is in fact equal to the curva-
ture of a locally dened line bundle over a . however, this interpretation will
not be used in this paper since there is no correspondence of it for the covariant
schwinger term, as will be explained in the next section.

3 derivation and interpretation of the covari-

ant anomaly and schwinger term

in the previous section we reviewed the result that the non-integrated consistent
anomaly and schwinger term are given by the parts in the expansion of

2n1(cid:16)a + v, (d + ) (a + v) + (a + v)2(cid:17)

(19)

that is linear and quadratic in the ghost, respectively. to be consistent with
earlier notation we should of course replace a with a, d with d , v with v
and  with  , for the consistent schwinger term. a close inspection of the
consistent anomaly and schwinger term reveals that the breakdown of gauge
invariance depends on the appearance of the brs operator  in this expression.
this makes it plausible that the covariant anomaly and schwinger term can be
derived by naively dropping . these obstructions have been obtained in many
dierent ways, see for example [1, 6] for the covariant anomaly and [5, 8, 9, 10]
for the covariant schwinger term, and they all agree with the result

given by the parts in the expansion of

(22)

that is linear respective quadratic in the ghost. (to have consistent notation
with the rest of the paper, replace a with a , and so on, for the covariant
schwinger term)

the theorem can be proven by explicit computations and comparison with (20)
and (21). since the computations for the covariant schwinger term are the most
dicult ones, we present them in the appendix. observe that the fact that
the covariant schwinger term is the part of (22) that is quadratic in the ghost
is not in agreement with the corresponding erroneous formula obtained earlier
in the literature, for example in [5].

the fact that theorem 1 is true implies that the covariant anomaly can be
obtained from a line bundle l dened as l, but with curvature f2 such that
the covariant correspondence of ( a, f ) in eq. (4) is a form that restricts to

2n1(cid:16)a + v, d (a + v) + (a + v)2(cid:17) at vertical directions. it is easy to see that

such a construction is possible, for example, a ane implies that the integral of
f2 over a subset of a without boundary is zero, which guarantees the existence
of a line bundle l with curvature f2. an explicit example is given by

for the covariant anomaly. however, it is easy to see that the cohomology class
of the covariant anomaly can be interpreted geometrically in a corresponding
way to what was done for the consistent anomaly. in fact, the considerations
in the previous section goes through word by word if putting a tilde on all
objects that appears. thus, the cohomology class of the covariant anomaly is

the obstruction in lieg-equivariance for a certain local non-vanishing section s
of l, with connection .

theorem 1 also implies that the covariant schwinger term can be obtained
in a similar way as the consistent schwinger term was derived: first, write
f2 as the integral over m of a form, a covariant correspondence of eq. (3).
then, consider the expression for f2 obtained by naively replacing m with a
manifold with boundary in eq. (3). after pull-back by q and restriction to
vertical directions, the covariant schwinger term is obtained. notice that when
these steps were performed for the consistent case we saw that the schwinger
term was equal to a curvature along gauge directions for a line bundle. this
comes form eq. (11) and the fact that the q pull-back of  vanishes at gauge
directions. in the covariant case, there is no direct correspondence of the family
index theorem and eq. (11). especially, the covariant schwinger term can not
be interpreted as the curvature of a line bundle (if it could, it would satisfy the
cocycle relation, which is not true).

transgression gives the map:

there is a natural normalization factor for the consistent anomaly and
schwinger given by the claim that f2 and f3 should obey the so-called
integrality condition. that means that the integral of f2 over any closed
surface in a/g is equal to an integer (or sometimes, an integer times a constant
factor), and corresponding for f3 and a closed volume in a/g. since it is
not possible to work on a/g for the covariant anomaly and schwinger term
(for n  3) it is not as easy to nd the correct normalization factor in this
case. we choose to dene the normalization factor for the covariant anomaly
and schwinger term simply by dropping the brs operator in the formula (19)
for their consistent counterparts, normalized by the integrality condition.

fujikawa [6] showed that the covariant anomaly can be obtained as the ob-
struction in g-equivariance for some determinant function. the determinant

10

function he used was a gauge covariant renormalized eective action. a correct
mathematical interpretation would be to view fujikawas determinant as a sec-
tion of a line bundle that to some perspective is covariant. since we obtain the
same result as fujikawa, this motivates us to use the name covariant determi-
nant line bundle for l. as mentioned in the introduction, the nal justication
for the name is that it predicts the covariant schwinger term as well. that
is, we get the same result as in [8, 9, 10] where the covariant schwinger term
was obtained from a renormalization of the commutator of covariant gauss
law operators. with the latter we mean the ordinary (consistent) gauss law
operators with the consistent current replaced with the covariant current.

4 a comparison of the consistent and covariant

formalism

in the consistent formalism, the russian formula implies

(d + )2n1(a + v, f ) = p (cid:16)(cid:16)(d + ) (a + v) + (a + v)2(cid:17)n(cid:17)

= p (f n) = d2n1(a, f ).

(27)

equating forms with the same bigrading gives the descent equations:

p (f n) = d2n1(a, v)

2n1(a, v) = d1
2n2(a, v) = d2
1

2n2(a, v)
2n3(a, v)

...

2n1

0

(a, v) = 0,

(28)

where k
2n1k(a, v) := 2n1 (a + v, f )(2n1k,k), see [13]. this provides an
alternative way to calculate the consistent anomaly and schwinger term (for
the latter it must of course be assumed that the operators and variables belong
to the physical space, which in this paper means that the index  should be
used). further, their cohomological meaning is also determined by this set of
equations.

for the covariant anomaly and schwinger term, there is no similar set of
equations. for example, eq.
(27) is based on the fact that f2, ver. = 0, a
relation whose covariant correspondence is not true. in the previous section
we showed that this implies that it is not possible to assign a cohomological
meaning to the covariant anomaly and schwinger term in the same way as was
made for their consistent counterparts. however, there has been attempts to
construct interesting covariant descent equations, see for example [2, 3, 5].

after having mentioned this important dierence between the consistent
and covariant formalism, we will now consider how the two formalisms can be

11

related. first of all, we would like to point out that they can be interpreted
in a similar way. both the consistent and covariant anomaly are the obstruc-
tion in g-equivariance for sections of line bundles. the consistent and covariant
schwinger term are both obtained by replacing m with a manifold with bound-
ary in the formula for the eective action, pull-back by q and restrict to vertical
directions.

an informative way to study the relation between the consistent and co-

variant anomaly is to consider their dierence:

1

loc.,2n2(a, v)

:= 1

2n2(a, v)  1

2n2(a, v)

= 2n1(cid:0)a, (d + ) a + a2(cid:1)(2n2,1)

dt tp (a, a, f n2

0

t

).

(29)

it is interesting to note that this form could have been obtained by transgression
of the curvature floc.,2 on the line bundle lloc. dened in the same way as l,
but with a replaced with a (this is the universal connection considered in [19]
for instance). lloc. diers from l and l in an essential aspect which now will be
explained. a form on a will be referred to as being a-local if it can be written as
a polynomial in a, da and daa. an example is given by 2n1(a, (d + da)a +
a2). its restriction to vertical directions in a is equal to the form 2n1(a, (d+
)a + a2) that appears in eq. (29). thus, the form 2n1(a, (d + )a + a2),
related to lloc., can be continuously extended to an a-local form. this is
however not possible for 2n1(a + v, f ) and 2n1(a + v, d(a + v) + (a + v)2),
related to l and l. that such an extension exists for 1
loc.,2n2(a, v) can be
seen from the fact that the right hand side of eq. (29) contains the ghost only in
the combination a, while it is not so for eq. (9) and (20). thus, the dierence
between the consistent and covariant anomaly can be continuously extended
to an a-local form, [20]. it is now clear that the covariant anomaly can be
obtained from the transgression of the curvature f2  floc.,2 on the line bundle
l(lloc.). this fact is equivalent with the approach of obtaining the covariant
anomaly with the introduction of a background connection (coming from lloc.)
which has been performed in the literature [7, 10]. this suggests the possibility
of that also the covariant schwinger term can be obtained from a background
connection, or equivalently from l (lloc.). however, this is not true since we
showed in the previous section that the covariant schwinger term is obtained
from l. in fact, if it would be possible to continuously extend 2

continuously extended to an a-local form. for n = 2 this fact follows directly
from a dimensional reasoning. thus, the dierence between the consistent and
covariant schwinger term can not be continuously extended to an a-local
form, in contrary to the case for the anomaly on a. notice however that for
n = 2 there exist a covariant representative of the cohomology class of the
consistent schwinger term.
it diers with a sign from our denition of the
covariant schwinger term.

for yang-mills and dieomorphisms

we here write down explicit expressions for the covariant yang-mills and dif-
feomorphism schwinger term in 1 and 3 dimensional space. for simplicity,
we will start with the case of yang-mills. assume thus that p () is the sym-
metrized trace times the factor c = 4(i/2)n/n! and consider eq. (21) for
n = 2 and n = 3:

we will now consider these expressions when m is an euclidean space and
all forms and functions have compact support therein. evaluated on innites-

it is known [1, 21] that the structure of the dieomorphism anomaly is
similar to the gauge anomaly. the same is true also for the schwinger term, [17].
the only thing that diers is the interpretation of the objects in the formulas.
for example, the space a of gauge connections a should be replaced by the
space of christoel connections . for a vector  generating a dieomorphism,
 = . thus, also in this case, the formulas
the ghost is locally given by v
for the consistent and covariant anomaly and schwinger term are given by eq.
(9), (13), (20) and (21). we will make this explicit by calculating the covariant
schwinger term in 1, 3 and 5 dimensional space. the relevant formula to use
is eq. (21) with p () = 4 a(), where a() is the a-roof function appearing in
the index theorem. it is not to be confused with the potential a considered
before. it is dened by

appendix: calculating the covariant schwinger

the case of the covariant schwinger term. eq. (5) gives
