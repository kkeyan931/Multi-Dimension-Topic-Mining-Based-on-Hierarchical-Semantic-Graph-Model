non-bps dirichlet branes

1. introduction

2

in the past year, non-bps dirichlet branes (d-branes) have attracted a fair amount of
attention [1, 2]. there exist in essence two dierent approaches to constructing and
analysing these states. in one approach that has been pioneered by sen [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
(see also sens talk at this conference), the non-bps d-branes are constructed as bound
states of brane-anti-brane pairs. this construction has been interpreted in terms of k-
theory by witten [8], and this has opened the way for a more mathematical treatment of
d-branes [9, 10]. in the other approach, d-branes (and in particular non-bps d-branes)
are described as coherent states in the closed string theory that satisfy a number of
consistency conditions [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. this approach will be explained in more
detail in the next section.

the motivation for studying non-bps d-branes is three-fold. first, in order to
understand the strong/weak coupling dualities of supersymmetric string theories in
more detail,
it is important to analyse how these dualities act on states that are
not bps saturated. since the dualities typically map perturbative states to non-
perturbative (d-brane type) states, we will naturally encounter non-bps d-branes in
these considerations. similarly, if we are to make progress in analysing the possible
dualities of theories without supersymmetryk, we have to develop techniques to treat
dirichlet branes without supersymmetry. second, since the eld theories describing
the low energy dynamics of non-bps d-branes are non-supersymmetric gauge theories,
congurations of non-bps d-branes might be useful for studying non-perturbative
aspects of the corresponding eld theories. finally, non-bps d-branes oer the
intriguing possibility of string compacitications in which supersymmetry is preserved
in the bulk but broken on the brane.

this talk is based primarily on [20]; more details about the boundary state approach

can also be found in [15, 18].

2. dirichlet branes from boundary states

a d-brane can be represented by a coherent (boundary) state of the closed string theory
that describes the d-brane as a source for closed strings. such a state describes a
submanifold on which open strings can end provided that it satises

(x i  x i)|bi = 0
(x i + x i)|bi = 0

i neumann direction,
i dirichlet direction,

(1)

where x  denotes the coordinate eld. in the following we shall always work in the
light-cone ns-r formalism. the directions  = 0, 1 will be taken to be dirichlet, so the
states are actually related by a double wick rotation to normal d-branes [14].
k some progress in this direction has recently been made in [15, 17, 18, 19].

non-bps dirichlet branes

for a dp-brane, the above conditions can be rewritten in terms of modes as

where 
r are the left and right-moving modes of the bosonic and fermionic
elds, respectively, and  =  describes the two dierent spin structures. for each choice
of  and in each left-right-symmetric sector of the theory (i.e.
in the ns-ns and the
r-r sectors), a unique solution (up to normalisation) to these equations exists

here r is half-integer in the ns-ns sector, and integer in the r-r sector. the ground
state |bp, i(0) is the tachyonic ground state in the case of the ns-ns sector, and it is
uniquely determined by the condition (2) and (3) with r = 0 in the r-r sector.

given two coherent boundary states, we can calculate the closed string tree
amplitude that describes the exchange of closed string states between the two boundary
states. because of world-sheet duality, this amplitude can be reinterpreted as a one-loop
open string vacuum amplitude. the actual d-brane state is a certain linear combination
of these boundary states in dierent sectors and with dierent spin structures [15]; this
linear combination is characterised by the condition that it satises:

(i) it is a physical state of the closed string theory, i.e.

it is gso-invariant, and

invariant under orbifold and orientifold projections where appropriate.

(ii) the open string amplitude obtained by world-sheet duality from the closed string
exchange between any two d-branes constitutes an open string partition function,
it corresponds to a trace over a set of open string states of the open string
i.e.
time-evolution operator.

(iii) the open strings that are introduced in this way have consistent string eld

interactions with the original closed strings.

in this talk we shall be mainly interested in stable d-branes; this requires in
particular that the spectrum of open strings that begin and end on the same d-brane
does not contain a tachyon.

the conditions that we have outlined above are intrinsic consistency conditions
of the interacting string (eld) theory; in particular, they are more fundamental than
spacetime supersymmetry, and also apply in cases where spacetime supersymmetry is
broken or absent.

non-bps dirichlet branes

2.1. an example: type iia and iib

4

in order to demonstrate that these conditions capture the essence of d-branes, let us
analyse, as an example, the case of type iia/iib string theory. in the ns-ns sector, a
gso-invariant boundary state exists for all p,

|bpin sn s = (|bp, +in sn s  |bp,in sn s) ,

(4)

but it does not describe a stable d-brane by itself since the open string that begins and
ends on |bpin sn s consists of an unprojected ns and r sector, and therefore contains
a tachyon in its spectrum. in fact (4) describes the unstable dp-brane for p odd (even)
in type iia (iib) that was described in sens talk; for p = 9, this coincides also with
the unstable d9-brane of type iia that was mentioned in horavas talk.

in order to obtain a stable d-brane, we have to add to (4) a boundary state in the

r-r sector; the only potentially gso-invariant state is of the form

|bpirr = (|bp, +irr + |bp,irr) ,

(5)

and it is actually gso-invariant if p is even (odd) in the case of type iia (iib). if this
is the case, we can nd a suitable linear combination
|dpi = nn sn s|bpin sn s  nrr|bpirr ,

(6)

whose corresponding open string spectrum consists of the gso-projected ns and r
sector. thus we have shown that the only stable d-branes in type iia and iib are the
familiar bps d-branes.

3. non-bps states in heterotic  type ii duality

many string theories contain states that are not bps-saturated but are stable due to
the fact that they are the lightest states of a given charge [3]. because of their stability,
these states must also be present in the dual theory.

one particularly interesting example where both theories can be analysed in detail
is the duality between the heterotic string on t 4 and type iia on k3 [21]. we shall
in particular consider the orbifold point of k3, where k3= t 4/zz2, since one can then
easily dene boundary states in the iia theory. the sequence of dualities relating the
two theories is given by

 iib t 4/zz

s iib t 4/zz

t iia t 4/zz2 ,

(7)

het t 4

s i t 4 t 4
where the various zz2 groups are
2 = (1, i4) zz

zz

2 = (1, (1)fli4) zz2 = (1,i4) .

(8)
here i4 reects all four compact directions,  reverses world-sheet parity, and fl is
the left-moving part of the spacetime fermion number.
it follows from (7) that the
 the sign in (6) distinguishes a brane from an anti-brane.

(9)

where ga, rai and gh, rhi are the coupling constant and the radii of the iia and the
heterotic theory, respectively, and vh = rh1rh2rh3rh4.

at the orbifold point, the gauge group of the iia theory is u(1)24; sixteen of these
u(1)s arise from the sixteen twisted rr sectors that are associated to the xed planes
of the orbifold, and the remaining eight u(1)s come from the 1-form and the 3-form in
ten dimensions. in the dual heterotic theory (that we shall take to be the spin(32)/zz2
theory), we also have to have an abelian gauge group, and this requires that appropriate
wilson lines are turned on

(10)

these break the gauge group so(32) to so(2)16  u(1)16. the actual form of the
wilson lines can be conrmed, a posteriori, by comparing the masses of the various
bps states. let us analyse some of them in turn.

1. bulk bps d-particles. the type iia orbifold possesses a bulk d-particle, which
corresponds to a type iia d-particle together with its image under zz2. this state
carries unit charge under the ten-dimensional r-r one-form c (1)
rr, and is described by
(11)
where  =  distinguishes the brane from the anti-brane, and |u0in sn s and |u0irr are
the gso-invariant combinations in (4) and (5), respectively. the corresponding bps
state in the heterotic theory is a kaluza-klein excitation (nl = 1) with momentum

|d0; i = |u0in sn s + |u0irr ,

pl =(cid:0)016; 03, /rh4(cid:1) ,

pr =(cid:0)03, /rh4(cid:1) .

it can be shown (see [20] for details) that the masses of the two states agree.

(12)

2. fractional bps d-particles. the orbifold theory also contains a fractional d-particle
that is stuck at one of the xed planes [22]. in the blow up of the orbifold to a smooth k3,
this state corresponds to a d2-brane which wraps a supersymmetric cycle [23]. in the
orbifold limit the area of this cycle vanishes, but the corresponding state is not massless,
due to a non-vanishing two-form ux b through the cycle [24]. in fact b = 1/2, and
the resulting state carries one unit of twisted-sector charge coming from the membrane
itself, and one half unit of d-particle charge coming from the d2-brane world-volume
rr  (f (2) + b(2)). the corresponding boundary state is of the form
(13)

action termr d3 c (1)

2h(cid:16)|u0in sn s + 1|u0irr(cid:17) + 2(cid:16)|t 0in sn s + 1|t 0irr(cid:17)i ,

|d0f ; 1, 2i =

1

non-bps dirichlet branes

6

where |u0in sn s and |u0irr are the same states that appeared in (11), and |t 0in sn s
and |t 0irr lie in the twisted ns-ns and twisted r-r sectors, respectively. here 1 = 1
and 12 = 1 determine the sign of the bulk and the twisted charges of the state,
respectively. as there are 16 xed planes, there are 64 such states altogether.

the corresponding states in the heterotic theory carry momentum

pl =(cid:0)12(02n, 1,1, 0142n); 03, 1/(2rh4)(cid:1) ,

(14)
the 16 vectors (02n, 1,1, 0142n), with n = 1, . . . , 8, are in one-to-one correspondence
with the 16 xed planes in the iia orbifold. for each such vector there are four dierent
heterotic states. these states carry half the charge of the states in (12) with respect to
the u(1) that is associated to the kk momentum, and their mass is therefore also half
of that of the states in (12). this is mirrored in the iia theory, where the coecients of
the boundary state (13) in the untwisted ns-ns and untwisted r-r sector (from which
the mass and charge can be read o) are half of those in (11).

pr =(cid:0)03, 1/(2rh4)(cid:1) .

3.1. non-bps states

the simplest stable non-bps state in the heterotic theory has momentum

pl =(cid:0)02n, 2, 0152n; 04(cid:1) ,

(15)
level matching requires that nr  cr = 1, and the state is therefore not bps [25].
the mass of this state is mh = 22, + and it is charged under precisely two of the 16
u(1)s that are associated with the 16 xed planes in the dual type iia theory, and
uncharged with respect to any of the other u(1)s. more generally, for each pair of xed
planes, there exist four non-bps states that carry charge 1 with respect to the two
corresponding u(1)s, but are uncharged with respect to any other u(1).

pr =(cid:0)04(cid:1) .

the above state carries the same charges as two bps states with charges

l =(cid:0)02n, 1, 1, 0142n; 03, 1/(2rh4)(cid:1) ,
p (1)
l =(cid:0)02n, 1,1, 0142n; 03,1/(2rh4)(cid:1) ,
p (2)
each of the two bps states in (16) has mass 1/(2rh4), and the decay of (15) into (16)
is energetically forbidden provided that rh4 < 1/(22). similarly, we can analyse the
other decay channels, and we nd that (15) is stable provided that

r =(cid:0)03, 1/(2rh4)(cid:1) ,
r =(cid:0)03,1/(2rh4)(cid:1) .

p (1)
p (2)

(16)

rhj <

22

j = 1, 2, 3, 4 .

(17)

as we have seen above, the two bps states in (16) correspond, in the dual type iia
theory, to two fractional bps d-particles that are localised at dierent xed planes,
and that have opposite bulk charge. the non-bps state (15) therefore corresponds to
a non-bps d-string that stretches between a pair of xed planes; in terms of boundary
states this non-bps state can be described as
|d1nonbps; , i =
+ in our conventions, 
 this state has also been independently constructed by sen [7]; compare also sens contribution to
these proceedings.

here  = 0,  describes the wilson line on the d-string, and |u1; in sn s is dened by
(19)

eiw|u1; win sn s ,

|u1; in sn s =xw

where w denotes the winding number along the direction of the d-string. the two
states in the twisted r-r sector |t 1; 1irr and |t 1; 2irr are localised at either end of
the d-string (so that the d-string stretches between two xed planes). using standard
techniques [15, 4], one can easily check that each of the boundary state components is
invariant under the gso and orbifold projections. furthermore, the spectrum of open
strings beginning and ending on the same d-string can be obtained, as usual, from the
cylinder amplitude of the above boundary state using world-sheet duality; for a suitable
normalisation of the dierent components, this leads to

[ns  r]

(20)
4 is the same as i4, except that it acts on x4 as x4  2ra4 x4. the boundary
where i 
state (18) therefore satises the consistency condition (ii). sen has also argued [6, 1]
that (iii) is satised.

4(cid:0)1 + (1)fi4(cid:1)(cid:0)1 + (1)fi 
4(cid:1) ,

for each pair of xed planes there are four such d-strings, that carry charge 1
(depending on the four choices of  = 0,  and  = 1) with respect to the two
twisted sector u(1)s associated to the two xed planes. these charges are of the same
magnitude as those of the fractional d-particles, since the ground state of |t 1irr is the
same as that of |t 0irr in (13). furthermore, it follows from (20) that the d-strings
have sixteen (rather than eight) fermionic zero modes, and therefore transform in long
multiplets of the d = 6, n = (1, 1) supersymmetry algebra. these states therefore
have exactly the correct properties to correspond to the above non-bps states of the
heterotic theory.

the d-string that corresponds to the state (15) stretches along the x4 coordinate

in type iia, and it is stable provided that

ra4 < 2

and

raj >

1
2

,

j = 1, 2, 3 .

(21)

indeed, if the former inequality is violated, the open string spectrum in (20) contains a
tachyon of unit kk momentum in the x4 direction; if the latter inequality is violated,
the spectrum contains a tachyon of unit winding in the x1, x2, or x3 direction. these
inequalities can also be determined by comparing the mass of the d-string with that
of a pair of fractional bps d-particles in the former case, and a pair of fractional bps
d2-branes in the latter.

the domains of stability (17) and (21) are qualitatively related by the duality map
(9). since the states in question are not bps, the masses are not protected from quantum
corrections, and one should not expect that the regimes of stability match exactly.

3.2. t-duality

t-duality relates the non-bps d-string (18) of the type iia orbifold to a non-bps d-
particle of type iib on t 4/(1)fli4 [16, 4]. (under s-duality, this orbifold is related to

non-bps dirichlet branes

8

the orientifold of type iib on t 4 by i4 [3], and the non-bps d-particle corresponds to
the rst excited state of the string that stretches between the d5-brane and its mirror
[16, 4].) as we have seen above, the non-bps d-string can decay into two bps d-
particles that sit at opposite ends of the d-string and carry opposite bulk charge. under
t-duality, this conguration corresponds to a bps d-string and an anti-d-string that
carry a relative wilson line. the above analysis therefore gives support for the claim
that the non-bps d-particle can indeed be described in terms of a brane-anti-brane pair
[4].

3.3. other non-bps states

the heterotic string theory also contains stable non-bps states that do not correspond
to d-branes in the iia orbifold. the simplest examples are the states that transform in
the spinor representation of so(32). in d = 10 these states have been identied with a
zz2-valued non-bps d-particle in the dual type i string [5, 6, 8]. the sequence of duality
transformations that relate the heterotic string on t 4 to type iia on k3 (7) suggests
that in six dimensions these states correspond to a non-bps (non-dirichlet) 4-brane,
which may be understood as a bound state of an ns5-brane and an anti-ns5-brane.

one can also compare non-bps states that are not necessarily stable. for example,
the heterotic theory contains states that are charged with respect to a single u(1)
associated with one xed plane in the dual iia orbifold, and are uncharged with respect
to any other u(1); one such state is of the form

pr =(cid:0)04(cid:1) .

pl =(cid:0)2, 2, 016; 04(cid:1) ,

(22)
the mass of this state is mh = 26, and it is actually unstable in the heterotic theory.
indeed, (22) can decay into four bps states of the form
p (1)
p (1)
l = (1, 0, 1, 013; 0, 0, 1/(2rh3), 0)
r = (0, 0, 1/(2rh3), 0)
p (2)
p (1)
l = (1, 0,1, 013; 0, 0,1/(2rh3), 0)
r = (0, 0,1/(2rh3), 0)
p (3)
p (3)
l = (0, 1, 0, 1, 012; 0, 0, 1/(2rh3), 0)
r = (0, 0, 1/(2rh3), 0)
p (4)
p (4)
l = (0, 1, 0,1, 012; 0, 0,1/(2rh3), 0)
r = (0, 0,1/(2rh3), 0) .

(23)

the mass of each of these states is 1/(2rh3), and this decay process is energetically
forbidden provided that
1
6

rh3 <

(24)

.

however, (22) can also decay into four winding bps states whose left-moving (shifted)
momenta are given by
p (1)
l = ( 1
2, 0, 0, 1
p (2)
2, 0, 0, 1
l = ( 1
p (3)
l = ( 1
2, 0, 0, 1
p (4)
2, 0, 0, 1
l = ( 1

where the corresponding right-moving momenta equal again the last four entries. each
of these has mass 2rh3, so this decay process is forbidden when

rh3 >

6

26

.

(26)

it therefore follows that the non-bps state is unstable for all values of rh3.

this is actually mirrored in the dual type iia theory, where (22) corresponds to
a state that has the same charges as two fractional bps d-particles that are located at
the same xed plane but carry opposite bulk charge. as was shown in [20], the theory
does not contain a stable d-brane with these charges. furthermore, the possible bound
state of the two d-particles does not exist, since a careful analysis of the potential
demonstrates that the interaction is always repulsive [26].

4. conclusions

we have demonstrated how non-bps d-branes can be used to probe string dualities
beyond the bps spectrum. for the case of the heterotic string on t 4 and type iia
on k3 that we have analysed in detail, both sides are quantitatively under control, and
one can compare the stability of the dierent non-bps states. we have found that the
domains of stability are qualitatively related by the duality map. it would be interesting
to analyse these non-bps states at more generic points in the moduli space of k3; rst
steps in this direction have recently been taken in [7, 27].

the techniques that we have described here should shed further light on the dualities
that have been proposed for some non-supersymmetric theories, in particular for the
models considered by kachru, kumar & silverstein [28] and harvey [29].
