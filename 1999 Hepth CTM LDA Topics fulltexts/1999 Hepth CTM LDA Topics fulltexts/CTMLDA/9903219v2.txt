we clarify a number of issues regarding the worldsheet and spacetime descriptions of string

propagation on ads3. we construct the vertex operators of spacetime current algebra and
spacetime (super) virasoro generators in the full interacting sl(2) wzw theory and study

their ward identities. we also explain the relation between the analysis in this note and

some recent work on this subject.

1. introduction

string theory on ads3 has many applications. it is related to the seminal work of
strominger and vafa on ve dimensional black holes [1]. it also provides an example of mal-

dacenas ads/cft correspondence [2]. in the context of this correspondence this example

is special because the boundary (or spacetime) cft is two dimensional, and therefore

it has an innite dimensional conformal algebra. this virasoro algebra was rst found by

brown and henneaux [3], who studied gravity on ads3. the ads3 example is furthermore
special since it is amenable to a worldsheet string theory description going beyond the (su-

per) gravity approximation. the spacetime virasoro symmetry of string theory on ads3
was exhibited in [4], where it was also shown that string excitations form representations of

this symmetry, in both bosonic and supersymmetric string theories. the work of [4] in the

bosonic case was later extended in [5]. the superstring was further discussed by [6,7] and

others. the results of [4] allow one to analyze vacua with neveu-schwarz (ns) background

elds in the nsr formalism. ramond-ramond (rr) backgrounds were discussed in [8-11].

one important lesson from these stringy analyses is that (some of) the observables in

the theory correspond to fundamental string excitations and are thus described by stan-

dard vertex operators in the brst cohomology. their worldsheet correlation functions,

which in at backgrounds are usually interpreted as s-matrix elements in target space, are

interpreted here as greens functions of operators in the spacetime cft [12,13].

in this note we will further extend the work of [4]. we will mainly use worldsheet

techniques, but in this section we start with a target space analysis, which provides useful

guidance to some aspects of the physics.

consider three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. the la-

grangian is

1
h

(1.1)

g(cid:0) 2

k

+ r(cid:1).

the vacuum solution of its classical equations of motion is ads3. three dimensional
gravity does not have propagating degrees of freedom. however, by a careful analysis of

the boundary conditions and the gauge transformations one should mod out by, brown

and henneaux showed [3] that this theory has two virasoro symmetries with central charge

24k

h

.

c =

(1.2)

the h in the denominator shows that the eect is classical and visible at the level of

poisson brackets (as in the computation of [3]). it is often said that this virasoro algebra

1

lives at the boundary of the ads spacetime. more precisely, the statement is that most

of the degrees of freedom of the graviton are pure gauge, with a remnant which can be

gauge transformed to innity. in perturbative string theory, choosing the lorentz covariant

conformal gauge on the worldsheet leads to landau gauge in target space. in this gauge

the physical degrees of freedom of the graviton are not supported only at the boundary

but in the entire ads3.

following horowitz and welch [14], (1.1) can be extended (as in string theory) by

adding the dilaton and the ns h = db eld

e2g(cid:0) 4

k

+ r + 4()2 

1
12

h 2

(cid:1),

(1.3)

where h was absorbed into a shift of . solving the equations of motion we nd (as usual

in string theory) that all the elds are determined except the zero mode of the dilaton,

which is an integration constant

e2 =

1
h

g = kg(0)


h =

1
k

 = kh (0),

(1.4)

where  is the volume form and g(0)
and henneaux analysis leads to a virasoro algebra with the central charge (1.2).

 and h (0) are independent of k. as above, the brown

the spectrum of the theory (1.3) includes a single particle, the dilaton, whose mass

is of order

1k

. the dilaton is sometimes referred to as a xed scalar. despite the fact

that the dilaton is massive, its zero mode h is an arbitrary integration constant. in other

words, the string coupling constant is arbitrary even though there is no massless eld which
changes its value1.

the value of h can be interpreted as arising from an electric source for h of strength

p =

4
hk

(1.5)

with coupling p

4 h b at innity. therefore, we can replace the arbitrary integration con-

stant h by the constant p. three dimensional gravity with non-zero h is analogous to

qed2 with a constant background electric eld, e = h/2, which can be thought of as

1 this situation is similar to the quasi-crystalline compactication to two dimensions [15].

2

resulting from an electric charge /2 at innity. qed2 is periodic in ; this is a result
of spontaneous creation of particles from the bulk and screening of the source at innity.

because of the constant negative curvature in our problem, the volume is proportional to

the area, and there is no gain in bulk energy while losing surface energy in the nucleation

process. hence, there is no spontaneous nucleation, and we do not expect periodicity in

p. although spontaneous nucleation does not happen, a long string can be created with a

nite amount of energy [16]. the nucleation process and the physics of the long string are

discussed in detail in [17]. we will return to the long string in section 7.

we will see later that, at least in some situations, the integration constant (1.5) is

quantized due to non-perturbative eects. p is then interpreted as the number of fun-

damental strings creating the ads background. it is natural to conjecture that all such

arbitrary integration constants which are not associated with massless elds are quantized

in string theory.

we now add to (1.3) gauge elds of a group g, like those in the ns sector in string

theory. they are associated with a bg current algebra on the worldsheet; the level of bg is

an integer kg. the target space lagrangian is

with

e2g(cid:0) 4

k

+ r + 4()2

h = db + kg,

h 2

 + kgf 2

(cid:1)

(1.6)

(1.7)

where  = tr(a  da + 2
3 a  a  a) is the chern-simons form of the gauge elds. the
solution of the equations of motion is as in (1.4). expanding the lagrangian (1.6) around

the classical solution we nd the chern-simons interaction

kgp
4

,

(1.8)

which leads to masses of order

1k

for the gauge elds.

the chern-simons interaction also leads to current algebra on the boundary [18] with

level

k(st)
g = kgp.

(1.9)

the result (1.9) was derived in [4] using worldsheet techniques. we now see that the

spacetime analysis leads to the same conclusion.

as in the case of the virasoro algebra discussed above, the spacetime current algebra

can be gauge transformed to the boundary of ads3. in string theory in conformal gauge

3

we are naturally led to the landau gauge a = 0. the remaining gauge freedom
corresponds to gauge transformations with a harmonic gauge parameter . the physical

degrees of freedom are massive spin one particles and various modes which are almost pure

gauge. these are modes with harmonic  which do not vanish at innity. these modes

lead to the current algebra. their prole is non-zero in the bulk of the space-time, as we

will see below, when we construct the vertex operators of these modes.

it is now clear that p must be quantized. this follows either from unitarity of the

spacetime current algebra or from the invariance of the lagrangian under large gauge

transformations. the quantization of p and its interpretation in terms of the number

of strings creating the background are in accord with the general expectation that the

only consistent backgrounds in string theory are those which can occur due to sources
which are themselves dynamical objects in the theory2. this is another reason to support

the conjecture above that the corresponding integration constants in string theory are

quantized. it is also clear that the quantization of p is non-perturbative in the coupling,
and cannot be seen at any nite order in the h  1/p genus expansion of string theory.

note that the discussion so far is completely general. it holds for any theory of gravity

with negative cosmological constant which is described at low energies by the appropriate

lagrangian, (1.1), (1.3) or (1.6). similarly, much of the rest of this note is true for any

vacuum of string theory that includes an ads3 factor.

we now add more structure to (1.6) by adding to it supersymmetry. in particular, we
are interested in the compactication of the type ii theory on t 4  s3 to three dimensions.
the bosonic lagrangian includes the terms (1.6) for g = su (2)lsu (2)ru (1)4
lu (1)4
r
gauge elds coming from kaluza-klein reduction of the ten dimensional metric and ns b
eld. the su (2) factors arise from the s3 and the u (1) factors from the t 4. the chern-

simons terms (1.8) for the gauge groups labeled by l and r have opposite signs. all the

massive gauge bosons have mass of order

1k

. those with one sign of the chern-simons

term have spin plus one and the others have spin minus one. the spacetime theory includes

a bg current algebra. the level (1.9) of the su (2)r factor is k(st)

su(2)r
dened as before by (1.5), (1.6)), while that of the u (1) factors is k(st)
u (1)4

u(1)r

l have the same levels as su (2)r and u (1)4

r but the opposite orientations.

= kp (k and p are

= p. su (2)l and

2 our problem is analogous to the problem of the massive iia theory in 10 dimensions analyzed
by polchinski and strominger [19]. they showed that the source at innity is quantized in units

of the d8-branes which are present in the theory.

4

additional gauge elds arise from the rr sector. these are most easily analyzed in

the iia language. in ten dimensions the rr gauge elds are a one form a and a three

form c. the relevant terms in the ten dimensional lagrangian are

1
2

(da)2 +

1
4!

(dc + h  a)2 + c  dc  h.

(1.10)

for simplicity we consider a square t 4 with equal sides v

1

4 . we denote the directions

along the t 4 by i, j, k, l, and the three non-compact dimensions by . the light vector

elds in three dimensions (which are s-waves on the sphere and constant on the t 4) are:

a = a, six elds a,ij = cij, and ea = ijklecijkl (ec is a ve form gauge eld, which

is dual in ten dimensions to c). after dimensional reduction to three dimensions and a

duality transformation on c we nd

v (da)2 +

1
v

(dea)2 + (daij)2 + ka  dea + kijklaij  dakl,

(1.11)

where the terms proportional to k arise from using the expectation value of h on s3.

in order to nd the spectrum of the theory we should diagonalize the mass matrix.

we nd eight massive spin one particles with mass of order

1k

. four of them (one linear

combination of a and ea, and the three aij which are self-dual on t 4) have spin plus one,

and the other four have spin minus one. we also nd u (1)4

r current algebras

l and u (1)4

whose level is k, the coecient of the chern-simons terms in (1.11).

the full current algebra of the model thus includes a u (1)8

r current algebra,
associated with a lattice of signature (8, 8). in the background we study, which is purely

l  u (1)8

ns, this lattice is the sum of two signature (4, 4) lattices; one for the ns elds and the

other for the rr elds. the corresponding levels of the current algebras are p and k.

we can also use the above comments to extend the analysis of [7] and study the
heterotic string on ads3s3t 4. at generic points in the narain moduli space the gauge
group is su (2)l  su (2)r  u (1)4
r , where all the gauge elds arise from the ns
sector. an analysis of the three dimensional eective action as above shows that the levels
of the two su (2) factors are kp and (k 2)p, and the u (1)24 has level p and is related to
a signature (4, 20) lattice. this theory is s-dual to the type iia theory on ads3 s3 k3,
also with ns background eld. the symmetry is again su (2)lsu (2)ru (1)4
lu (1)20
r ,

l  u (1)20

5

but here the su (2)r  su (2)l is from the ns sector and has level3 (kp,k(p 2)), while
the u (1)4
r is from the rr sector, still with a signature (4, 20) lattice but with
level k. these conclusions are consistent with s duality, which exchanges ve branes and

l  u (1)20

one branes, i.e. k and p.

in the rest of this note we will develop a worldsheet description of string theory on

ads3, which is consistent with the general picture described in this section and makes it

more precise. we will construct the vertex operators of the ane lie algebra and virasoro

generators described above, in the exact worldsheet theory, and show that their correlation

functions satisfy the ward identities of two dimensional cft.

one important lesson we will learn concerns the origin of the singularities in correla-

tion functions in the spacetime cft. such singularites occur when two operators approach

each other on the boundary. the locations of the operators on the boundary are param-

eters labeling the corresponding vertex operators in the rst quantized theory. as these

parameters are varied, singularities can occur either because the worldsheet functional in-

tegral over the non-compact target space diverges, or because the integral over the location

of vertex operators on the worldsheet diverges. the analysis in [4] shows that the singular-

ities occur from the region where vertex operators approach each other on the worldsheet.

thus, short distances on the worldsheet are mapped by the ads/cft correspondence to

short distances on the boundary. the discussion in [5] and its extension below further

shows that the above divergences in the boundary theory arise because the target space

is non-compact and are dominated by the asymptotic region of the target space. thus,

short distance behavior on the worldsheet and on the boundary is related to long dis-

tance behavior in the target space gravity theory. all this is consistent with  and nicely

demonstrates  the well known relation between short distance physics on the worldsheet

and long distance physics in target space, which is generally true in string theory, and the

uv/ir relation of [20], which relates the short distance regime of the spacetime cft to

the asymptotic region of the dual string theory target space.

3 the dierence of 2k between the levels of su (2)l and su (2)r in this case is due to a one
string loop correction. our formalism should allow one to compute these corrections by studying

the two point functions of various currents on the (worldsheet) torus. since the asymmetry in

question is due to an anomaly, one should compute the contribution of the odd (++) spin structure

to such two point functions. calculating this one string loop shift would provide interesting tests

of our formalism and of heterotic  type iia duality.

6

we start in section 2 by describing classical and quantum cft on ads3. in section
3 we use this description to construct vertex operators corresponding to the generators

of a spacetime ane lie algebra associated with a current algebra on the worldsheet of

the string. in section 4 we prove that these vertex operators satisfy the correct spacetime

current algebra ward identities and nd the operator that plays the role of the central

extension in this current algebra. in section 5 we study this central extension and compute

the level of the spacetime current algebra.

in section 6 we generalize the construction to the virasoro case. we nd the vertex

operator of the stress tensor of the spacetime theory and comment on some of its properties.

in section 7 we explain the relation of the present construction to that of [4]. section

8 contains some comments on the generalization of our results to the superstring. we

summarize our results in section 9.

2. conformal field theory on ads3

in this section we describe some properties of (worldsheet) cft on ads3, which will be
useful later in the analysis of string theory in this background. we focus on the euclidean
version of ads3, the non-compact manifold h +
3 = sl(2, c)/su (2). for some early work
on cft and string theory on ads3 see e.g. [21].

2.1. classical cft on ads3

h +
3 has constant negative curvature  = 2/k (in string units). it is described by

the metric

ds2 = k(d2 + e2dd),

(2.1)

where (, , ) are coordinates on h +
3 , with  = ,  = . to dene a cft with this
target space one has to turn on additional -model couplings. one possibility is to turn

on a neveu-schwarz b eld, which leads to the worldsheet lagrangian

l = k(cid:0)  + e2 (cid:1) .

(2.2)

the cft described by (2.2) has an innite ane sl(2)  sl(2) symmetry which, as we
will see below, is very helpful in studying the theory. the global part of the algebra is

generated by

j0 = ; j 3

j0 = ; j 3

0 =  
0 =

; j +

; j +

0 = 2    e2
0 = 2    e2.

7

(2.3)

a large class of observables in this theory is obtained by studying functions on h +
3 . such
functions can be decomposed in terms of representations of sl(2)  sl(2). a convenient
tool for performing this decomposition was proposed in [22] (and further developed in [23];

see also [24]). one introduces an auxiliary complex variable (x, x) and uses the standard
representation of the sl(2)  sl(2) lie algebra as the dierential operators

j0 =  x; j 3
j0 =  x; j 3

0 = (xx + h); j +
0 = (xx + h); j +

0 = (x2x + 2hx)
0 = (x2x + 2hx),

(2.4)

where h is related to the sl(2) spin of the representation4 j by h = j + 1. we will refer

to the auxiliary space labeled by (x, x) as spacetime below, to be distinguished from the
three dimensional target space of the -model, h +
3 , labeled by (, , ). (x, x) label the
space on which the dual (or spacetime) cft lives.

one is looking for functions fh,h(, , ; x, x) that transform in the spin (j, j) =
(h  1, h  1) representation of sl(2)  sl(2). the functions fh,h satisfy the dieren-
tial equations

[j0 , fh,h] = xfh,h = fh,h
[ j0 , fh,h] = xfh,h = fh,h
[j 3
0 , fh,h] = (xx + h)fh,h = ( 
0 , fh,h] = (xx + h)fh,h = ( 
[ j 3
[j +
0 , fh,h] = (x2x + 2hx)fh,h = (2    e2)fh,h
0 , fh,h] = (x2x + 2hx)fh,h = (2    e2)fh,h.
[ j +

)fh,h

(2.5)

the brackets [  ] in these equations are poisson brackets since we are in the classical
theory. the most general solution of the rst four equations in (2.5) is

fh,h =

1

(  x)h(  x)h

hh,h(cid:0)(  x)(  x)e2(cid:1)

(2.6)

with hh,h an arbitrary function. the last two equations in (2.5) have solutions only for
h = h, in which case one nds (in a convenient normalization)

fh,h  h =

1

 (cid:18)

(  x)(  x)e + e(cid:19)2h

.

(2.7)

4 the value of the quadratic casimir in the representation is j(j + 1).

8

since h is an eigenfunction of the laplacian in the bulk, it is the propagator of a particle
with mass squared h(h 1)/k from the boundary point x to the bulk point (, , ). note
also that (2.5)  (2.7) imply that one can think of h as components of a tensor of weight
(h, h) in spacetime, h(x, x)dxhdxh. this tensor is non-singular for nite (x, x) (for xed,
nite (, , )). it is also regular at x  ; to exhibit that, redene x = 1/x, and use
the transformation h(x, x)dxhdxh = h(x, x)dxhdxh.

we can expand h around   

h =

1

 (cid:18)

1

|  x|2e + e(cid:19)2h

=

e2(h1)2(  x) + o(e2(h2)) +

2h  1

e2h

|  x|4h + o(e2(h+1)).

(2.8)

for generic h the expansion (2.8) can be naturally separated into two independent series.
one series includes the leading term in the    limit5, e2(h1)2(x), and an innite
n
x 2(  x). this series is present only in the
series of corrections of the form e2(hn1)n
x
vicinity of  = x. the second series starts with the dominant term for generic ,
|x|4h ,
and includes corrections that are down by e2n with n  z+.

e2h

the situation here is similar to that in liouville theory [25]. the analogs of the wave-

functions h (2.7) in that case are the exact minisuperspace wavefunctions, the modied

bessel functions k . the operators (2.7) with real h are the analogs of microscopic oper-

ators in liouville theory. the analog of the expansion (2.8) is the expression of k as a
linear combination of i . as in (2.8), for generic  expanding i around    gives
rise to two innite series that do not mix. for integer  the two series mix and interesting

resonances occur. analogous phenomena exist in our case; the two series in (2.8) mix
when h  z/2.

as we approach h = 1/2 in (2.7), the behavior of h changes:

(1) for h > 1
(2) for h = 1

2 (and   x) the leading term at large  is e2(h1)2(  x).
2 we have a resonance (e2(h1) = e2h) and the leading term in the
expansion of (2.8) is 2e2(x). this is consistent with the fact that the coecient
of e2(h1)2(  x) in (2.8) diverges as h  1
2 .

5 for  = x the leading term diverges as e2(h1)2(0). this reects the fact that the dominant
term at  = x is e2h. however, since our vertex operators will always be integrated over, we
should use the expression e2(h1)2(  x) and drop the term e2h.

9

(3) for 0 < h < 1

2 the leading term is

|x|4h . however, the integral r d2h over
|  x| <  does not vanish as   0. therefore, one cannot neglect the contribution
2h1 e2(h1)2(  x) to h.

e2h

1

(4) for h = 0 we have a more dramatic resonance and 0 = 1.
(5) for h < 0 the leading term at large  and generic ,
(6) for all values of h discussed above, he grows as   . thus h is a non-
normalizable operator, as is familiar from liouville theory and the ads/cft corre-

|x|4h , diverges as   .

spondence.
since (2.4) j0 =

 x , every observable (x, x) is conjugate to (0)

(x, x) = exj

therefore, it is natural to dene

(2.9)

(2.10)

since all these currents are related to each other by dierentiation, it is enough to consider

j(x; z)  j +(x; z) = 2xj 3(z)  j +(z)  x2j(z).

an explicit computation shows that

j(x; z) = k(cid:2)(x  )2e2z  + 2(x  )z  z(cid:3) .

similar expressions can be written for j(x; z).

(2.11)

(2.12)

j(x; z) is a spacetime tensor of weight (1, 0) which, just like h, is non-singular for
all x. the transformation properties (2.5) of h under sl(2) sl(2) can be summarized
by the following action of the charges j0(x) associated with the conserved currents (2.11)

[j0(x), h(y, y)] =(cid:2)(y  x)2y + 2h(y  x)(cid:3) h(y, y)

and a similar relation for j0.

an observable which will be important below is

j(x; z)1(x, x; z, z).

10

(2.13)

(2.14)

it is easy to check that

where

j1 = z,

(  x)(  x)e2
(  x)(  x)e2 + 1

.

(2.15)

(2.16)

since 1 is a tensor of weight (1, 1) in spacetime, while j is a tensor of weight (0, 1),
(2.15) suggests that  is a tensor of weight (1, 0). however, the operators (2.7) are all
left-right symmetric and as indicated above there are no solutions of (2.5) for h 6= h.
what is then the status of  of (2.16)? one can check that  transforms as follows under
sl(2)  sl(2)

[j0(x), (y, y)] =(cid:2)(y  x)2y + 2(y  x)(cid:3) (y, y)  1
(cid:2) j0(x), (y, y)(cid:3) =(y  x)2y(y, y).

(2.17)

comparing to (2.13) we see that  indeed transforms like an object with h = 0 under sl(2),

while its transformation as an object with h = 1 under sl(2) contains an anomalous term,

which is a constant (independent of the worldsheet elds and of x, y). thus, it is natural

to expect that  is not a good observable in cft on ads3. later we will provide two

independent arguments that support this conclusion. however, we will also see that the

object of interest to us will be z which, as is clear from (2.15), is a good observable in
the theory6. this is consistent with the fact that the anomalous contribution to [j +

0 , ],
being constant, disappears when we dierentiate with respect to z as in (2.15). we also

note for later use that:

(1) as we approach the boundary of ads3,

 =

lim


1

x  

.

(2) as functions on ads3,  and 1 (2.7) are related by

x = 1.

(2.18)

(2.19)

6 as a good analogy consider the operators x and zx in two dimensional massless scalar
eld theory. while x is not a good observable, e.g. because its two point function is logarithmic
in the separation, hx(z)x(w)i  log |z  w|2, zx is a good observable.

the operators h are primaries of the full dsl(2)  dsl(2) algebra8. they satisfy

and similar opes with the j a. all operators in cft on ads3 can be obtained by acting
on the primaries h by the currents j(x; z), (2.11), and j(x; z).

the stress tensor of the worldsheet cft is given by the sugawara form

using (2.22). they are

(2.23)

the operator product expansions (2.20) and (2.21) can be expressed in a more compact

form using the operator j of (2.11)

(2.25)

these expressions are in accord with the interpretation of j(x) as j + conjugated to the

point x (2.10). this point of view also makes it obvious why the opes (2.24), (2.25) are

regular when x = y.

the stress tensor (2.22) can be written directly in terms of the current j(x; z) as

(2.26)

a few comments:
(1) using 3

xj = 0, xt ws = 0. the combination (2.26) corresponds to a tensor in

spacetime of weight (0, 0).

(2) the composite operator j(x)h(x, x) does not require normal ordering, and the clas-

sical manipulations in (2.14) and (2.15) are justied in the quantum theory. thus

(2.15) holds in the quantum theory (without any nite renormalizations). a related

fact is that j(x)h(x, x) is a primary of worldsheet virasoro (2.22).

(3) useful special cases of (2.24), (2.25) are

j(x; z)1(y, y; w, w)

(4) in the free eld wakimoto representation [26], (2.11) takes the form (+ = 2k  4)

j(x; z) = (x  )2 + +z(x  )  kz,

(2.28)

which is related to the classical expression (2.12) by the appropriate rescaling of the

variables, certain nite renormalizations, and the equations of motion of the wakimoto
representation, which imply  = ke

+ z .

2

the two point function of h is determined by worldsheet conformal invariance and the
sl(2)  sl(2) action (2.21). it is

hh(x, x; z, z)h(y, y; w, w)i = (h  h)

d(h; k)

|x  y|4h|z  w|4h

.

(2.29)

the numerical coecient d(h; k) has been computed in [23]. note that for h = h the two
point function is innite  it is proportional to (0). this innite factor can be interpreted

13

as the volume of the subgroup of the sl(2, c) isometry of our target space, which preserves

x and y.

when considering string theory on ads3 one has to integrate over the locations of
all vertex operators on the worldsheet and to divide by the volume of a subgroup of the

two dimensional dieomorphism group isomorphic to the mobius group sl(2, c)m . for

the zero point function, the cft correlation function is proportional to the volume of the

target space; i.e. to the volume of sl(2, c). dividing by the volume of sl(2, c)m we nd

a nite answer. similarly, a one point function, if it does not vanish, is proportional to the

subgroup of sl(2, c) which leaves one point in the target space invariant. dividing by

the volume of the subgroup of sl(2, c)m which leaves a point on the worldsheet invariant

we again nd a nite answer. finally, for the two point function, the cft correlation

function is proportional to (0), as above, but in string theory this innity is cancelled by

a similar factor from sl(2, c)m . all this is exactly as in non-critical string theory [25].

one can also compute the ope of j with  by integrating (2.27) with respect to

y. the y independent integration constant can be determined by comparing with the

semiclassical analysis (2.17), or by using the free eld representation (2.28). this leads to

j(x; z)(y, y; w, w)  (cid:2)(y  x)2y + 2(y  x)(cid:3) (y, y; w, w)  1

z  w

.

(2.30)

we can now provide an independent argument that  itself is not a good observable in the

theory. according to (2.15), (2.19), (2.29) the two point function of  satises

h(x; z)(y; w)i =

a log|z  w|2 + b log|x  y|2

(x  y)2

,

(2.31)

where a and b are innite constants that become nite when passing to string theory, as

discussed above. we have also used the fact that correlation functions are single valued

both on the worldsheet and in spacetime. the correlator (2.31) depends logarithmically

on the separation, both on the worldsheet and in spacetime. hence, like x in free eld

theory,  is not a good observable.

another argument that  cannot be a good observable in cft on ads3 follows from
the relation (2.19). 1 is used in string theory on ads3 to dress marginal operators in
the spacetime cft. if  was a good observable, all dimension (1, 1) operators in the

spacetime cft would have been total derivatives with respect to x of operators with

scaling dimensions (1, 0). this is highly unlikely based on the available information about

particular examples of string theory on ads3 (see e.g. [4] for details). if one further assumes

14

that the spacetime cft is unitary, any operator of dimension (1, 0) must be holomorphic

(in x), and therefore we would have concluded that there are no marginal operators at all

in the spacetime cft, which again contradicts available information.

we next turn to the ope algebra of the dsl(2) primaries h. de boer et.al. [5] studied

the operator product h1(x1, x1; z1, z1)h2 (x2, x2; z2, z2) in the semiclassical region of large
k, for h2 of order k and h1 of order one. the insertion of h2 aects the worldsheet and
takes (z2)   and (z2)  x2. therefore, the operator product expansion is dominated
by large  and   x2,

k2

h1 (x1; z1)h2 (x2; z2)  |z1  z2|4 (h11)(h21)
2(x1  x2)h1+h21(x2; z2),
where we inserted the factor |z1  z2|4 (h11)(h21)
on dimensional grounds. we can also
study this operator product when h1, h2  k in the semiclassical region. in this limit the
dimensions of all h are much smaller than one. therefore, the leading contribution comes
from terms with no derivatives in the operator product expansion h1h2 . terms with
derivatives have larger dimensions. at large , the product behaves like

(2.32)

k2

h1h2 =e2(h1+h22)2(  x1)2(  x2) + o(e2(h1+h23))
=e2(h1+h22)2(x1  x2)2(  x2) + o(e2(h1+h23)).

(2.33)

k2

therefore, it is approximately h1 (x1; z2)h2(x2; z2) = 2(x1  x2)h1+h21 + ... where
the ellipses stand for operators with h < h1 + h2  1. when k is large but not innite the
dimensions of the operators do not vanish and the right hand side should be multiplied
by |z1  z2|4 (h11)(h21)
, as in (2.32). the operators with h < h1 + h2  1 have larger
dimension than h1+h21 and therefore they are negligible as z1  z2. we conclude that
at least for h1  k and k  1
h1 (x1, x1; z1, z1)h2 (x2, x2; z2, z2) =
c12|z1  z2|4 (h11)(h21)

2(x1  x2)h1+h21(x2, x2; z2, z2) + smaller terms as z1  z2.
(2.34)

k2

for small values of h the asymptotic form of the vertex operators is dierent (see the

discussion above) and this conclusion could be modied. a special case of (2.34) is

lim
z1z2

1(x1, x1; z1, z1)h(x2, x2; z2, z2) = 2(x1  x2)h(x2, x2; z2, z2).

(2.35)

an important aspect of (2.35) is that the coecient on the right hand side is independent

of h and therefore we can normalize 1, as in (2.8), such that it is equal to one.

15

in the exact theory the situation is more complicated. the ope structure is [23]

h1(x1, x1; z1, z1)h2(x2, x2; z2, z2) =

z dh3z d2x3

fh1h2h3 (xi, xi)h3(x3, x3; z2, z2)

|z1  z2|2(1+23)

+ descendants.

(2.36)

the ope coecients fh1h2h3 (xi, xi) can be computed by studying the three point functions
of hj in cft on ads3. they have two components. the one that is studied in [23]
corresponds to f123 which is a smooth function of xi and of hi. later we will be interested

in computing the ope (2.35) in the exact theory. smooth f s do not contribute to this

quantity since one could continue analytically in h from a region where the limit of (2.35)
as z1  z2 vanishes.

a second class of f s corresponds to distributions in xi. in particular, we can examine

the possibility that

h1 (x1, x1; z1, z1)h2 (x2, x2; z2, z2) 

f (x1, x2)

|z1  z2|2(1+23) h3(x2, x2; z2, z2).

(2.37)

in that case, sl(2) invariance constrains severely the function f (x1, x2) and (2.34) is one

of the only consistent solutions of the sl(2) ward identity. indeed, applying h j(y) to

the two sides of the ope (2.37) where the contour surrounds z1, z2, we nd that f must

satisfy

[(x1  y)2x1 + (x2  y)2x2 + 2h1(x1  y) + 2h2(x2  y)  2h3(x2  y)]f = 0.

(2.38)

the coecient of y2 in (2.38) (the j ward identity) shows that f depends only on x1x2.
the coecient of y in (2.38) (the j 3 ward identity) leads to

[(x1  x2)x1 + (h1 + h2  h3)]f = 0.

therefore, if f is not a distribution,

f = (x1  x2)h3h1h2 .

(2.39)

(2.40)

the term without y in (2.38) is then satised only if h2 = h1 + h3. for the particular case
of interest in (2.35), h1 = 1, we nd that h2 = h3 + 1, and the power of |z1  z2| in (2.37)
is 4h3/(k  2) > 0. thus, such an f does not contribute to the limit (2.35).

16

if we also allow f which is a distribution, (2.39) can be satised by

f = n

x1  n

x1 2(x1  x2)

for h1 + h2  h3 = n + 1.

(2.41)

a similar relation with j sets n = n. the term with no y in (2.38) further allows the answer
to be of this form only for n = 0, h1 + h2  h3 = 1 or h1 = (n + 1)/2, h3 = h2  (n + 1)/2.
to summarize, we see that terms of the form (2.37) in the ope 1h give a nite
contribution in the limit z1  z2 only if x1 is in the vicinity of x2. the corresponding
ope coecient is proportional to 2(x1  x2), as in (2.35). note that it is not guaranteed
a-priori that one can choose the numerical prefactor on the right hand side of (2.35) to

be one (it could depend on h). we saw that this prefactor can be chosen to be one in

the semiclassical limit, and we will assume that this continues to hold in the exact theory.

this assumption is necessary for the spacetime ward identities.

the above discussion also shows that the divergence of the ope coecient in (2.35),
2(x1  x2), as x1  x2 is directly related to the non-compactness of ads3. short distance
singularities in the spacetime cft come from    on ads3. as discussed in the
introduction, this is an example of the uv/ir correspondence of [20].

another description of cft on ads3 is obtained by fourier transforming the local

elds h and dening the mode operators

vj;m, m =z d2xxj+m xj+ mj+1(x, x).

the inverse transformation is

h(x, x) = xm, m

vh1;m, mxmh x mh.

(2.42)

(2.43)

equations (2.42), (2.43) are essentially mode expansions of the local spacetime elds in

the dual cft and, just as in standard cft, the local elds are the fundamental objects

and the modes may or may not be well dened and useful. indeed, in (2.43) it is in general
not clear what range the variables (m, m) should run over9. in (2.42) the integral over x is

in general divergent and is dened by nding a region where it converges and analytically

continuing from there. this may or may not be possible in dierent cases. thus, we will

here work with local elds in x space and not with their modes. the modes vj;m, m have

9 locality in (x, x) space implies that m  m  z, but m + m is not constrained.

17

the scaling dimensions (2.23) with h = j + 1. they satisfy the ope algebra with the

currents (which is equivalent to (2.21), (2.25))

j 3(z)vj;m, m(w, w) 
j(z)vj;m, m(w w) 

mvj;m, m
z  w
(m  j)vj;m1, m

z  w

(2.44)

and similarly for j a(z). in addition to primaries, the theory contains descendants which
have higher order poles in their ope with j a. the latter can be described as (normal
ordered) products of currents and their derivatives with vj;m, m.

3. the spacetime current algebra

we next turn to (bosonic) string theory on ads3  n , with n an arbitrary compact
manifold which together with ads3 provides a solution of the string equations of motion
(see [4] for a more detailed discussion). assume that the cft on n contains a worldsheet
current algebra associated with some group g, generated by worldsheet currents ka(z)
satisfying

ka(z)kb(w) 

1
2 kgab
(z  w)2 +

f abckc(w)

z  w

,

(3.1)

where kg is the level of the worldsheet ane lie algebra bg and 1

i f abc are the (real)
structure constants of g. one can then construct in the spacetime theory currents k a(x),
which satisfy an algebra similar to (3.1). the purpose of this section is to construct the

generators of this spacetime current algebra, following [4]. on general grounds one expects
the local eld k a(x) to be described by the vertex operator of an almost pure gauge eld.
we start with a review of some relevant properties of gauge elds in string theory.

associated with each worldsheet current ka(z) satisfying (3.1) one nds in string

theory a target space gauge eld whose vertex operator is

z d2zaa

(x)ka(z)zx,

(3.2)

where x are coordinates on the target space10. under innitesimal gauge transformations
the gauge eld aa

 transforms as11

aa

 = a.

(3.3)

10 in our case the target space is ads3, and (x) = (, , ).
11 for simplicity, we neglect the non-linear term in the gauge transformation, i.e. assume that

a is small.

18

thus, a pure gauge eld (3.2) is described by the vertex operator

z d2zka(z)za(x),

(3.4)

where a is the gauge function. the fact that the theory is gauge invariant implies that cou-

plings like (3.4) do not inuence the physics, however this is only true for gauge functions
a with compact support in target space. as we will see in detail below, gauge transfor-
mations with gauge function a that do not vanish at the boundary of ads3 generate a

large algebra of global transformations, the ane lie algebra bg.

there is an important point that should be mentioned here. eqs. (3.2), (3.4) describe

gauge eld couplings in the -model. in string theory, one has to impose the worldsheet

consistency conditions.

in particular, the integrands of (3.2), (3.4) must be primaries

under the left and right-moving worldsheet virasoro symmetries with scaling dimension

(1, 1). when the target space is at, this implies that the gauge eld satises the gauge
condition aa
 = 0). the
remaining gauge freedom corresponds to gauge functions satisfying a = 0. if the
gauge function a has compact support, it can be fourier transformed. the corresponding

 = 0 (as well as the massless klein-gordon equation  aa

operators are r d2zka(z)zeikx with k2 = 0. moding out by brst commutators removes

such operators.

another set of pure gauge operators satisfying a = 0 is associated with a =
x and a = 1. these gauge functions do not go to zero at innity. the corresponding

vertex operators,r d2zka(z)zx andh dzka(z), are in the brst cohomology. the status

of the above two kinds of operators in string theory is actually somewhat dierent. the
gauge functions a = x are not good operators in the worldsheet conformal eld theory.

this can be seen by noticing that their two point functions depend on the logarithm

of the separation. therefore, the corresponding pure gauge vertex operators are not

brst exact and give rise to physical vertex operators (the zero momentum gluons). the
gauge function a = 1 does correspond to a good operator on the worldsheet (the identity

operator), and the corresponding vertex operator r d2zka(z)z1 vanishes. its vanishing is

the statement that all correlation functions in string theory are invariant under the global

part of the gauge symmetry.

returning to string theory on ads3, we expect the spacetime ane currents to have

the form

k a(x) =z d2zka(z)z(, , ; x, x)

19

(3.5)

with a gauge function  that does not go to zero as   . since k a(x) has spacetime
scaling dimension h = 1, h = 0, we are looking for an operator z with worldsheet scaling
dimension (, ) = (0, 1) and spacetime scaling dimension (h, h) = (1, 0). we constructed
precisely such an operator in (2.15), (2.16). below we will determine the normalization
 =  1

 ,

(3.6)

k a(x) = 

1

 z d2zka(z)z(, , ; x, x).

the spacetime current (3.6) is formally pure gauge, but the gauge function  does not

have compact support, and is not a good observable in cft on ads3. the corresponding
vertex operator k a(x) does not decouple from correlation functions. another useful way
of writing k a(x) (using (2.15)) is

k a(x) = 

1

k z d2zka(z) j(x; z)1(x, x; z, z),

(3.7)

which makes manifest the fact that k a(x) is physical and has weight (1, 0) in spacetime.
from the point of view of the spacetime theory we expect the current k a(x) (3.6)

to be holomorphic, up to contact terms. dierentiating (3.6) with respect to x and using

(2.19) gives

xk a = z d2zka(z)z1.

(3.8)

unlike (3.6), xk a given by (3.8) is a total derivative of a good observable in cft on
ads3, and we expect it to decouple (for generic x). indeed we will see in the next section
that (3.8) vanishes inside correlation functions, except for contact term contributions at

the locations of other operators in the correlation function. these contact terms give rise

to the ane lie algebra ward identities familiar from two dimensional cft.

to summarize, pure gauge vertex operators (3.4) in string theory belong to one of

a few classes, depending on properties of the gauge function (x). if  is normalizable,

(3.4) is null and decouples. this is the situation usually considered in string theory. if  is

non-normalizable but is a good observable in the worldsheet cft, like 1 (3.8), the pure
gauge eld (3.4) decouples generically, e.g. for generic momenta or for generic x in the

ads3 example (3.8). if the gauge function  is not a good observable in the worldsheet
theory, but z is (as in (3.6), (3.7)), the gauge eld (3.4) does not decouple and is in
the brst cohomology. gauge functions  for which z is not a good observable (e.g.
 = xx in at spacetime) should not be considered, since in that case (3.4) is not a

physical operator.

20

4. the current algebra ward identity

now that we have constructed the spacetime ane lie algebra generator k a(x) we

would like to study its correlation functions. the typical correlation function of interest is

hk a(x)k b(y)wh(s, s)  i,

(4.1)

where wh(s, s; w, w) is an operator that transforms in some representation r of the world-
sheet current algebra,

ka(z)wh(s, s; w, w) 

ta(r)wh(s, s; w, w)

z  w

.

(4.2)

ta(r) are the representation matrices of the lie algebra of g in the representation r. h

labels the transformation properties of wh under the worldsheet dsl(2) dsl(2) algebra; in

other words12, wh(s) includes a factor of h(s). general considerations in the spacetime
cft imply that the correlation function (4.1) should satisfy the standard current algebra

ward identities,

f abck c(y)

k a(x)k b(y) 
k a(x)wh(s, s) 

1

2 k(st)
g ab
(x  y)2 +
x  s

ta(r)wh(s, s)

x  y
.

(4.3)

our main task in this section is to derive this ward identity in string theory on ads3, and
to compute the level of the spacetime current algebra k(st)
g .

the strategy of the calculation is the following. the integral in (3.6) runs over the
whole worldsheet, . we would like to write k a(x) as an integral of a total derivative.
since zka(z) = 0 except for delta function contributions at the locations on the worldsheet
of the other insertions in the correlator, we can write the integrand of (3.6) as a total
derivative if we restrict the worldsheet integral to , the riemann surface  with small
holes around the insertions removed. the integral (3.6) over such holes goes to zero as

their size is taken to zero; therefore, extracting the holes does not change the value of

correlators like (4.1) and amounts to a particular regularization.

after extracting the holes we can rewrite (3.6) as

k a(x) = 

1

 z

d2zz [ka(z)(x, x; z, z)] .

(4.4)

12 for simplicity, we will restrict to whs that are primary under worldsheet dsl(2)  dsl(2).

as explained in [4], there are many physical operators that are descendants of worldsheet current

algebra but are physical in string theory (i.e. primary under worldsheet virasoro).

21

if the worldsheet correlators of  are well behaved, we can perform the integral in (4.4)

and it will receive contributions only from the boundaries of the riemann surface with
holes . this leads to the representation

k a(x) =xi

ici

dz
2i

ka(z)(x, x; z, z),

(4.5)

where ci is the boundary of the small hole around the ith insertion.

previously we have argued that  is not a good observable in cft on ads3; e.g. it
has a logarithmically divergent two point function (2.31). however, the question that is

relevant for analyzing the validity of (4.5) is how (z, z) behaves as one approaches an

insertion involving h or some (worldsheet) current algebra descendant thereof. to see
that near such insertions  is well behaved, one can integrate (2.35) with respect to x1,
using

x

= 2(x  y),

(4.6)

1

x  y

and x the x1 independent integration constant by a combination of semiclassical and free
eld techniques. this leads to

lim
z1z2

(x1, x1; z1, z1)h(x2, x2; z2, z2) 

1

x1  x2

h(x2, x2; z2, z2).

(4.7)

alternatively, one can dierentiate (4.5) with respect to x and use (2.19). one nds

xk a(x) =xi

ici

dz
2i

ka(z)1(x, x; z, z),

(4.8)

which is equivalent to (3.8). here there are no subtleties regarding the existence of the right

hand side in cft on ads3. the two representations (4.5), (4.8) are of course equivalent
but below we will nd it convenient to use (4.5) in the asymptotic analysis near  = 
(in section 7) and (4.8) in the discussion of the exact theory (in this section).

note that (4.8) and the related form (3.8) provide an example of the worldsheet

 spacetime relation discussed in [4]. the left hand side of (3.8) is naively zero since
k a(x) is a holomorphic current in spacetime. correlation functions of xk a such as (4.1)
receive contact term contributions from the boundaries of spacetime, which correspond

to x approaching other insertions. these contributions are governed by the spacetime
ward identities. the right hand side of (3.8) is naively zero since ka(z) is a holomorphic
current13. correlation functions of the right hand side of (3.8) receive contributions from

13 or, equivalently, the right hand side of (3.8) is brst exact on the worldsheet.

22

the boundaries of the worldsheet, which correspond to z approaching other insertions.

these contributions are governed by the worldsheet ward identity.

in the rest of this section we will derive the spacetime ward identity for removing
k a(x) from correlation functions like (4.1) by using the representation (4.8) for k a. sub-
stituting xk a(x) (4.8) in (4.1) we have to analyze the contributions to the correlator from
the boundaries of the worldsheet, ci. consider the contribution from a small circle around
the location of wh(s, s)

using (2.35), (4.2) and performing the integral over z leads to

hxk a(x)wh(s)  i  2(x  s)ta(r)hwh(s)  i,

(4.10)

which is the correct result (4.3) (using (4.6)).

the contribution to the correlator (4.1) from a small circle surrounding the location

of another current, k b(y), can be computed similarly

(4.11)

there are now two contributions, from the single and double pole in the worldsheet ope

(3.1). the single pole is treated in a similar way to the one discussed for wh above. the
only new element here is that there might be an additional contribution from the ope of
j(y; w) with 1(x, x; z, z). since that ope has a positive power of x  y and it multiplies
a 2(x  y) (2.35), this contribution vanishes. thus in direct analogy to (4.10) one nds
that the single pole contribution gives

hxk a(x)k b(y)  i = 2(x  y)f abchk b(y)  i +    .
the double pole contribution to (4.11) gives an operator proportional to

z1(x, x; z, z) j(y; w)1(y, y; w, w),

lim

(4.12)

(4.13)

which we would like to compute using (2.35). unfortunately, the limit (4.13) is sensitive
to the o(z  w) term in (2.35) which of course is suppressed as z  w. nevertheless, we
can make use of (2.35), by using the fact that

z1(x, x; z, z) =

1
k

x [j(x; z)1(x, x; z, z)] .

(4.14)

23

this can be shown by computing the ope of the worldsheet stress tensor (2.22) with 1
using (2.21) and isolating the single pole term, which by denition is z1. an alternative
proof of (4.14) is obtained by using the fact that 1 = x  (the complex conjugate of
(2.19)); thus

where in the last step we used the complex conjugate of (2.15). subsituting this form of

(4.16)

finally, collecting all the terms and coecients, we nd that the spacetime currents satisfy

(4.18)

(4.19)

in the next section we discuss the operator i (4.18) that appears in the spacetime current

algebra, and study the consequences of (4.19) for correlation functions in string theory on

ads3.

5. properties of the central extension

the discussion of the previous sections makes it clear that the operator i (4.18) has

the following properties:

(1) it is physical (brst invariant) in string theory on ads3. naively i is brst exact
because of (2.15), but like the spacetime current k a(x) it does not decouple, for the

same reasons.

24

(2) as is clear from the form of the vertex operator, i is essentially a mode of the dila-

ton/graviton eld.

(3) it transforms as a tensor of weight (0, 0) in spacetime, i.e. its scaling dimensions in
the spacetime cft are h = h = 0. therefore, we intepret it as (a multiple of) the
identity operator of the spacetime cft.

for this interpretation to be consistent, i must be a constant, xi = xi = 0. to prove
that i is indeed independent of x, x, one can use considerations similar to those of the

previous sections. by using (2.15) we can write xi (up to a constant, which is irrelevant
for the argument) as

xi z d2zj(x; z)z1 z d2zz [j(x; z)1] i dzz .

(5.1)

so, xi is given by an integral of a total derivative over the boundary of the worldsheet.
this will vanish, unless there is a (worldsheet) singularity in the ope of the operator 
with other physical operators in the theory. but we have used above the fact that such

opes are in fact regular (see e.g. (4.7)). hence, the operator (5.1) actually decouples in

all correlation functions and we conclude that xi = 0. a similar argument can be used
to show that xi = 0.

the fact that i is a constant means that it is not a vertex operator of a scalar particle

in ads. above we noticed that it is a mode of the spacetime dilaton eld. these two

assertions are consistent because the dilaton is a xed scalar and hence it is massive. as a

massive particle it does not have an on-shell zero mode. i is a physical on-shell zero mode

of the dilaton eld. it is related to the integration constant discussed in section 1. below

we will write the vertex operator of the massive dilaton.

this similarity and distinction between the massive dilaton and i is identical to the
relation between the massive gauge bosons and the current algebra vertex operators k a(x).

the latter are vertex operators of modes of the gauge elds, which should not be confused

with the vertex operators of the massive gauge elds. below we will write the vertex

operators of the massive gauge elds.

could the constant i be zero? the two point function hi(x)i(y)i is proportional to
h1(x, x; z, z)1(y, y; w, w)i which cannot vanish14. therefore, i is a non-zero multiple
(which will be computed below) of the identity operator of the spacetime theory.

14 vertex operators of marginal operators in the spacetime cft are products of marginal op-
erators on the worldsheet and 1. their two point functions lead to the zamolodchikov metric
and are proportional to h11i. thus the latter cannot vanish.

25

to see the consequences of the ope (4.19) for correlation functions in string theory

on ads3, consider a correlation function of the form

gab(x, y, x1,    , xn)  hhk a(x)k b(y)vh1(x1)   vhn (xn)ii,

(5.2)

where vhj (xj) are any physical operators in string theory on ads3, and the double bracket
notation implies that (5.2) receives contributions from all worldsheet topologies including
disconnected ones (this point was emphasized in [5]). as x  y, gab exhibits the following
behavior

gab(x, y, x1,    , xn) =

2 kgab
(x  y)2hhivh1(x1)   vhn (xn)ii +

f abc

x  yhhk c(y)vh1(x1)   vhn(xn)ii + nite.

thus, the level of the spacetime current algebra k(st)

g is

k(st)
g = kgp (gs),

where p (gs) is dened by

hhivh1(x1)   vhn (xn)ii = p (gs)hhvh1(x1)   vhn(xn)ii.

(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

this is the statement that i is a multiple of the identity operator. in order to explore

(5.5) and to express p (gs) in terms of correlation functions of i, we consider for simplicity
a case where the disconnected correlation functions of the vhi all vanish. it is simple to
generalize the discussion to the case where they do not vanish. then,

hhivh1(x1)   vhn (xn)ii = hhiiihhvh1(x1)   vhn (xn)ii + hhivh1(x1)   vhn (xn)iiconnected,
(5.6)

where the last term is a sum over all genera but only of connected worldsheets. comparing

(5.5) an (5.6) we see that connected correlation functions must satisfy

hhivh1(x1)   vhn(xn)iiconnected = i(gs)hhvh1(x1)   vhn (xn)iiconnected

(5.7)

with i(gs) independent of the operators vhi . this is a strong assumption, which we do not
know how to prove, but below we will give some evidence that it is true. equations (5.5),

(5.6) and (5.7) imply that

p (gs) = hhiii + i(gs).

26

(5.8)

to leading order in gs (or equivalently 1/p (1.5)), p (gs) = hii0 = i0z0, where i0 is the
normalized one point function of i on the sphere,

i0  hii0

,

(5.9)

where z0 is the spherical partition sum. similarly, the leading order form of (5.7) is

hivh1(x1)   vhn (xn)i0 = i0hvh1 (x1)   vhn (xn)i0

(5.10)

from which we see that the leading behavior of i(gs) as gs  0 is i(gs) = i0 + o(g2
leading term is xed by setting all vh to one in (5.10) and comparing to (5.9).

s). the

the assumption (5.7) can be tested and the value of i0 can be determined by com-
paring dierent correlation functions. consider for example the following three point
functions15 and use (5.10)

c111

|x1  x2|2|x1  x3|2|x2  x3|2 .

(5.13)

comparing (5.11) and (5.12) we nd three equations for the two unknowns c111 and i0.

c111 = k;

i0 =

provides a consistency check of the assumption (5.10).

the leading order contribution to the spacetime level (5.4) is thus kgz0i0. the
partition sum on the sphere can presumably be calculated using worldsheet methods; this

has not been done to date and we will not attempt to compute it here. alternatively,

one can use the fact that the partition sum of any string theory on the sphere is equal

to the classical action evaluated on the solution of the equations of motion. substituting

(1.4) into (1.3) gives zero, but the action has a nite surface term of order kp. therefore,
z0  kp up to a numerical coecient (independent of k, p) which we will not attempt to
x. this leads to

k(st)
g  kgz0i0 = kgp

(5.15)

(where the  sign refers to the large p approximation) in agreement with the spacetime
result (1.9). the numerical coecient, which has not been computed, can be xed either

by a calculation of the worldsheet partition sum or by a gibbons-hawking type calculation

of the classical action corresponding to (1.3), (1.4); the latter is known to give the correct

answer (5.15).

6. the spacetime virasoro symmetry

in this section we generalize the results of the previous sections to the case of the

spacetime virasoro symmetry. the discussion is analogous to the one for ane lie algebras,

so we mention only the new aspects. using the expected spacetime scaling dimension of

the spacetime stress tensor t (x) we can write it as a linear combination

t (x) =z d2z(cid:2)a1j(x; z)2

x1 + a2xjx1 + a32

(6.1)

xj1(cid:3) j(x; z).

brst invariance imposes a constraint on the coecients ai. one solution, with the overall
normalization xed below, is

t (x) =

x1 + 3xjx1 + 32

xj1(cid:3) j(x; z) =
xj(cid:3) .

(6.2)

we have already seen above that xr d2zj j1 = r d2zz( j1) = 0. therefore, we have
the freedom to shift t by any constant timesr d2z2
xj1(cid:1) j(x; z) =

2k z d2z(cid:0)xjx1 + 22

and vanishes in correlation functions). using this freedom we can write

2i(cid:0)xjx + 22

xj(cid:1) .

x(j1) j (this operator is brst exact

t (x) =

note that:

(1) t (x) is a tensor of weight (2, 0) in spacetime. in fact, imposing that it should be such

a tensor is an alternative way of xing the relative coecients in (6.1).

(2) one might wonder whether it is possible to generate tensors of weight (h, 0) with

h > 2 in string theory on ads3 by generalizing the logic of (6.1)  (6.3). it is easy
to see that there are no new operators (in addition to n
x t (x)) at higher levels; the
reason is that 3

xj(x; z) = 0.

it is usually said that in string theory on ads3 (with bn s turned on) the dilaton is a
xed scalar, meaning that it is massive. these statements refer not to the vertex operators

(4.18),(6.3), which are almost pure gauge. the vertex operator of the massive dilaton is

d(x, x) =z d2z(cid:0)xjx + 22

xj(cid:1)(cid:0)x jx + 22

x

j(cid:1) 1,

(6.4)

which has spacetime scaling dimension (2, 2) and is only quasi-primary under the spacetime
virasoro algebra  it has the quantum numbers of t (x) t (x). a similar statement can be
made regarding the gauge bosons associated with a worldsheet ane lie algebra ka(z). the

gluons get a mass from the chern-simons term discussed in section 1. the corresponding

vertex operators are

aa(x, x) =z d2zka(z)(cid:0)x jx1 + 22

x

j1(cid:1) .

(6.5)

the operators aa have scaling dimension (1, 2) in the spacetime cft and have the quan-
tum numbers of k a(x) t (x).

however, d(x, x) 6= t (x) t (x) because the two point function of d(x, x) scales like
s, while that of t t arises from a disconnected diagram and scales like 1/g4
s . similarly,

1/g2
aa(x, x) 6= k a(x) t (x).

to derive the virasoro ward identity it is convenient to insert into correlators the

(6.6)

operator xt ,

xt (x) =

a calculation of the sort outlined above for the ane lie algebra case can now be performed

7. relation to [4]

the original analysis of [4] is valid in the free eld region of   . therefore, in
order to compare our exact discussion above with [4] we should rst consider the behavior

of all our operators in that limit.

using lim  = 1/(x  ) (2.18) in the expression for the current (3.6) we nd

k a

x ; i.e. performing

the fourier transform discussed in section 2, to nd

recalling that (z) is holomorphic in the    limit, we can rewrite (7.1) as

using

lim


1 = 2(  x)

and the expression for j, (2.12), we recognize (7.4) as the limit as    of (3.7).

similarly, using (7.5) and (2.12) in the exact expression for i (4.18) we nd

i =z

(7.7)

in agreement with the corresponding expression in [4].

30

the analysis of the ward identities of the previous sections simplies considerably in
the    limit and becomes identical to [4] (up to the fourier transform from x space
to the modes). indeed, consider the    limit of the correlation function (4.1)

f (x)k b

hk a

f (y)wh(s, s)  i

(7.8)

with operators wh(s), which are proportional to e2(h1)2(  x) (see, (2.8)). (in [4]
the fourier modes of these operators (2.42) were used.) the contribution to (7.8) from a

contour c around one of the wh operators is

where we used the ope (4.2) and the fact that wh is proportional to a delta function. we
also used the fact that there is no short distance singularity in the ope (z)(w) (again
in the free eld region   ).

a similar calculation of the contribution from the region where k a

f approaches on the
f is most conveniently done by using the representation (7.2)
f . there are now two contributions coming from the single and

worldsheet another current k b
for k a

f and (7.4) for k b

in agreement with [4]. the ope algebra (6.7) can be derived similarly to the ane lie

algebra case discussed above; as there, the derivation is related to the discussion of [4] by

a fourier transform.

so far we have shown how the exact expressions in the previous sections simplify as
   and reproduce the (fourier transform to x space of the) corresponding expressions
in [4]. we next look more closely at the relation between the two calculations.

the vertex operators in the theory can be determined in the free eld region   .
the quantum numbers of these vertex operators can also be determined in the asymptotic

region. however, their correlation functions depend on the entire space and cannot be

computed using only the free eld region. an exception to this is ward identities like

(7.11). these are associated with singularities in x space. as explained in the introduc-
tion, such singularities are determined by the    limit. for holomorphic operators
like k a(x) the correlation functions are completely determined by the singularities and

therefore the asymptotic analysis suces. the rest of the information in the correlation

functions depends on the full structure of the theory including the bulk of the target space

where  is small. we conclude that the asymptotic expressions of the vertex operators, as

in [4], are good for some purposes like enumerating the vertex operators in the theory and

for deriving ward identities like (7.11), but in order to nd the exact correlation functions

the more complete form of the vertex operators given in this paper is necessary.

another important point has to be discussed. the expression (7.6) for the asymptotic

form of i is the degree of the holomorphic map (z). clearly it is an integer q independent

of the other insertions in the correlation function

hif v1 . . . vni = qhv1 . . . vni,

(7.14)

and therefore if is central. for example, if (z) = z, q = 1. other values of q can be
obtained, e.g. from (z) = zq. even though if is simply the limit of i as   , the
expression for the central charge (7.6) diers from the discussion in section 5 in several

crucial respects:

(1) in section 5 the leading order contribution to the central charge came, as in [5], from

a disconnected diagram, while here the contribution is from a connected diagram.

(2) in section 5 p = hii0 was not quantized. this is consistent with the expectations
from the spacetime analysis described in the introduction that p is quantized only
non-perturbatively. here, q = hifi is quantized already classically.

32

(3) in the discussion in section 5 connected diagrams also contribute to p (gs). as we
saw in (5.14), the leading order connected contribution is i0 = 1/k which is not even
quantized. this is consistent since there is another (disconnected) contribution at

the same order. in the computation with if the entire contribution comes from the

connected diagram.

(4) the expression (7.6) is non-zero only if the worldsheet is mapped to an innite plane in
h +
3 . maps of the worldsheet to a compact region in the target space lead to hifi = 0.
on the other hand, we expect that, at least semiclassically, the leading contribution

to the functional integral comes from such maps. indeed, the expressions in section 5

can come from maps to a compact region.
what is then the meaning of hifi = q? clearly, it receives contributions only from
worldsheets at large , which have the topology of a plane rather than from small world-

sheets. unlike the discussion in section 5, which applies to short strings propagating in the

bulk of ads3, the discussion of the central charge here and in [4] applies to a worldsheet
of a long string in the region   .

such long strings appeared in [16] and a detailed discussion of them appears in [17].

recall that p is the number of fundamental strings creating our background. therefore, q

coincident long strings act as a domain wall changing the value of p. on one of its sides
we nd the original value of p. on the other side the value of p is screened to p  q.
the eective theory of the long string is a conformal eld theory. the vertex operators in

this theory describe the emission and absorption of short strings from it. however, since

the worldsheet of the long string is at large , we can safely use the asymptotic form of

the vertex operators. the worldsheet in this problem is the worldsheet of the long string

which is non-compact. furthermore, in the eective theory of the long string there are no
disconnected worldsheets, as these describe short strings only. hifi measures the number
of long strings. therefore it is quantized even at tree level.

this interpretation of the calculation of hifi = q neatly explains the four puzzles

above.

to summarize, the structure emerging from [4,17] and this note is the following. string

theory on ads3 with a given value of p (1.5) contains many dierent sectors. one sector
corresponds to short strings, i.e. maps from the worldsheet of the string to a compact

region in ads3. this is the sector described in this note. in it, p determines the fundamen-
tal string coupling, g2
s  1/p. the quantization of gs is a non-perturbative eect which is

not seen in our classical analysis, as explained in section 1.

33

other sectors contain in addition 0 < q  p long strings at innity. these sectors
contain two kinds of excitations, fundamental strings propagating in the bulk of ads3 and
small ripples on the long strings at innity.

the analysis of [4] plays two roles in string theory on ads3.

in the short string

sector of the theory, physical observables correspond to microscopic operators in the

language of liouville theory [25]; their wavefunctions are exponentially supported at the
boundary   . thus in order to identify the observables and study their transformation
properties under the spacetime symmetries, it is enough to analyze the wavefunctions at

large ; this is done in [4].

in particular, the analysis of [4] proves that fundamental

string states transform in representations of the innite spacetime symmetry algebra; it

also exhibits the set of representations that appear in the fundamental string spectrum.

correlation functions of these observables (and in particular the central charge) are
not supported at   , and thus one needs to analyze the behavior of the theory in the
bulk of ads3.

a second place where the analysis of [4] is applicable is in studying the eective theory

of the q long strings located near the boundary of ads3. there, the free eld description
is applicable. the vertex operators of [4] describe small excitations of the long strings

and the current algebra generators (e.g. (7.1)) can be used to study the transformation

properties of these excitations under the spacetime symmetry algebra. if (7.6) keeps track
of the central charge carried by these long strings. as one would expect, it is quantized at

tree level.

8. superstrings on ads3  s3  t 4

the supersymmetric case adds to the previous discussion a few new issues, such as

the spacetime physics of rr sector elds.

in this section we briey comment on the

generalization of the construction of the previous sections to the superstring (see [4,7] for

more details).

in addition to the bosonic sector of the worldsheet theory we now have free worldsheet
fermions a(z) which transform in the adjoint of sl(2) (and a similar structure for the
other worldsheet chirality). the total sl(2) currents j a(z) now have two contributions:
a level k + 2 bosonic current j a

b + j a
f .
it is convenient to follow the discussion of the bosonic case and use (2.9) to dene

b , and a level 2 fermionic current j a

f ; j a = j a

(x; z) = 2x3  +  x2.

(8.1)

(x; z) satisfy the ope algebra16

(x; z)(y; w) 

2(x  y)2
z  w

.

(8.2)

note that (x; z), like j(x; z) in the bosonic case, has spacetime scaling dimension 1.
the fermionic sl(2) current can be written in terms of (x; z) as

jf (x; z) =

1
2

(x; z)x(x; z).

(8.3)

it is easy to check that it satises (2.24) with k = 2. thus, the total sl(2) current is

j(x; z) = jb(x; z) + jf (x; z).

the worldsheet stress tensor (2.26) of the bosonic degrees of freedom is given by

t ws
b =

and the superconformal generator is (up to an overall constant which will not play a role

as in the bosonic case, it is easy to see that xt ws

the chiral gso projection implies that the worldsheet theory contains (, ) = (1, 0)

(8.11)

following the by now familiar pattern, we are looking for spacetime holomorphic

operators involving the worldsheet current . one can check (using (8.5)  (8.7)) that

the operator

e(x) = 

1

k z d2zee(x; z)e  (x; z)1(x, x; z, z)

(8.12)

is brst invariant. it corresponds to a dimension ( 1

2 , 0) fermionic operator. in fact, the

four spacetime fermions e(x) are the bottom components of n = 4 superelds whose

top components are the u (1)4 currents

p i(x) = 

1

k z d2ze i(z) (x; z)1(x, x; z, z),

which were constructed in [4] and further discussed in [7].

at the next level we nd the spacetime n = 4 superconformal currents

g(x) = 

1

k z d2z (x1 + 21x) e  .

(8.13)

(8.14)

the form of the stress tensor is an obvious generalization of (6.2), (6.3). using the formal-

ism of the previous sections one can show that the superconformal generators satisfy the

n = 4 superconformal algebra in spacetime.

note that just as in the bosonic case studied in the previous sections, the operators

(8.12)  (8.14) describing holomorphic operators in the spacetime cft are almost pure

36

gauge. the basic observation17 is that the h = 0 combination exp()(x; z)1(x, x; z, z)
can be written as

e(x; z)1(x, x; z, z) = {qbrst , e2(x, x; z, z)},

(8.15)

where  is a eld arising in the bosonization of the bosonic ,  ghosts in the fermionic

string, and  is our old friend (2.16). the fact that  is not a good observable in cft on
ads3 again implies that despite (8.15), exp()(x; z)1(x, x; z, z) is not brst exact. at
the same time its correlation functions can be computed by a straightforward generalization
of the bosonic analysis. this can be done by working directly with the 1 picture eld
(8.15), or by picture changing it to the 0 picture, where it can be written as a total
derivative, jb(x; z)1(x, x; z, z)  z, and one can proceed as in the previous sections.
in section 1 we saw from a target space analysis that rr gauge elds on ads3 have a
mass of the same order of magnitude (1/k) as that of the ns sector gauge elds. this is
manifest in the worldsheet formalism. the jth partial wave of an ns gauge eld obtained

by kaluza-klein reduction from ten to three dimensions is described by the vertex operator

ai

j = e(x; z)e i(z)j+1(x, x)vj(z, z),

(8.16)

where vj is the wavefunction on s3 (see [4,7] for details). aj transforms in the spin (j, j)
representation of su (2)l  su (2)r and has spacetime scaling dimension

(h, h) = (j, j + 1).

the corresponding rr gauge eld is described by the vertex operator

(8.17)

(8.18)

j = e 

2  

re

2ee(cid:16) xj+ 1

2

where e,  and v are coupled into a representation with total spin (j, j) under su (2)l 

su (2)r (as (8.16)). the spacetime scaling dimension of (8.18) is again given by (8.17).

in fact, the operators (aj, rj) together with their antiholomorphic counterparts form

multiplets of the u-duality group. these multiplets were studied in [7].

in section 1 we also saw that string theory on ads3  s3  t 4 is expected to have in
r current algebra described on the worldsheet by (8.13)
r current algebra associated with rr gauge

addition to the ns u (1)4
and its right moving analog, a u (1)4

l  u (1)4

17 in (8.12)  (8.14) we actually need the antiholomorphic version of the formulae below.

37

elds (see the discussion after (1.10)). one would expect this current algebra to correspond

to rr vertex operators on the worldsheet. we have been unable to nd vertex operators

with the right properties. it is possible that we have not looked carefully enough. however,

since the spacetime cft is two dimensional and there are no perturbative string states

which are charged under this rr current algebra, it forms a decoupled sector of the theory.

therefore, it is not clear whether such vertex operators should be found in our worldsheet

approach.

9. summary

in this paper we studied string theory in an ads3 background. most of the discussion

did not depend on many of the details of how this background is generated. on general

grounds, the three dimensional low energy eective lagrangian is (1.3)

e2g(cid:0) 4

k

+ r + 4()2 

1
12

h 2

(cid:1).

(9.1)

the equations of motion show that h is nonzero and the zero mode of  is an arbitrary

integration constant. the nonzero h can be interpreted as arising from a source of strength
p = 4
hk

at innity. classically and to all orders in perturbation theory p is an arbitrary

real number. when there is a worldsheet current algebra bg at level kg, there are gauge
elds in spacetime and the lagrangian (9.1) is modied to (1.6). as a result, bg current

g = kgp appears in the spectrum. hence, nonperturbatively p must be

algebra at level k(st)

quantized.

we then studied various properties of the worldsheet cft on ads3. following [22] we

parameterized the operators in terms of their sl(2) quantum number h and a continuous

complex parameter x, which is interpreted as a coordinate on the boundary of the space,

on which the spacetime cft lives. the operator (2.7)

1 =

 (cid:18)

(  x)(  x)e + e(cid:19)2

,

(9.2)

which has worldsheet conformal dimensions (0, 0) and spacetime dimensions (1, 1) plays an

important role in the theory. using this operator, the worldsheet sl(2) current j(x; z) and

38

bg worldsheet currents ka, we constructed the vertex operators of the spacetime current

algebra (3.5), the spacetime identity operator (4.18), and spacetime virasoro algebra (6.2)

(9.4)

which can be proven in the leading order in the large k semiclassical expansion, we showed

that (9.3) satisfy the correct operator product expansion in spacetime

the fact that i in (9.3) behaves like a spacetime identity operator follows from another

assumption which we did not prove, (5.7).

as we stressed, since the rst quantized string description is in landau gauge, we

do not have the freedom to gauge the operators (9.3) to the boundary. therefore the

corresponding vertex operators have nontrivial proles in the bulk of ads3.

extending these techniques to the superstring we found the expected n = 4 spacetime

superconformal algebra.

as   , one recovers the results of [4]. the discussion of [4] can be used for
two distinct purposes in string theory on ads3. in the short string sector it is useful

for enumerating the observables and studying their transformation properties under the

spacetime symmetry algebra. it can also be used to study the physics of long strings in

ads3. one important dierence between the physics of short strings and long strings is the

39

value of the central charge. for short strings the central charge arises (in leading order),

as in [5], from disconnected diagrams. as expected from the spacetime analysis, it is not

quantized in perturbation theory. for long strings the central charge arises as in [4] from

a cylindrical connected diagram. it is quantized at the leading order.
