abstract

we construct a deformation of the quantum algebra f un(t g) associated with
lie group g to the case where g is replaced by a quantum group gq which has a
bicovariant calculus. the deformation easily allows for the inclusion of the current
algebra of left and right invariant one forms. we use it to examine a possible
generalization of the gauss law commutation relations for gauge theories based on
gq.

1 introduction

for many descriptions of dynamical systems where continuous symmetries are present,
one requires more than the existence of a lie group g and its corresponding lie algebra
g. rather, one often relies on the existence of a bicovariant calculus on g. this is
especially true when constructing currents and current algebras. a bicovariant calculus
is also useful for gauge theories. loosely speaking, the bicovariant calculus allows for
compatible left and right actions on a bimodule constructed on the group. the bimodule
is spanned by the left or right invariant one forms. there is a natural construction of a
bicovariant calculus for any lie group g.

the same cannot be said for quantum groups. the notion of a bicovariant calcu-
lus for quantum groups was introduced by woronowicz [1]. (also see [2], [3], [4], [5],
[6], [7]).) only for a class of quantum groups {gq} does a structure analogous to the
one for lie groups exist. there have subsequently been several attempts to apply this
structure to dynamical systems [8],[9]. in these works, one nds generalizations of the
usual classical lagrangians for gauge theories, including chern-simons theory and grav-
ity. however, such systems have the novel feature that the classical eld degrees of
freedom end up being noncommuting operators. their physical interpretation is, to say
the least, obscure. the situation is somewhat reminiscent of the classical lagrangian
description for fermions expressed in terms of grassmann elds. that description de-
rives a meaning due to the existence of a canonical quantization scheme which turns
it into the usual quantum mechanical description of fermions. an analogous canoni-
cal quantization scheme for classical lagrangian descriptions of quantum group gauge
symmetries is not obvious. this being the case, there is currently not much use in having
such lagrangians, aside from being a curiosity.

under these circumstances it is reasonable to skip the step of canonical quantization
entirely, and start instead with the quantum theory. that is, we can try to incorporate
the structure of a bicovariant calculus for a quantum group gq in quantum theory. for
ordinary lie groups g, a natural setting for a bicovariant calculus is provided by the
cotangent bundle t g. left and right actions on t g are obtained via the pullback
from g of right invariant or left invariant one-forms, and they are generated using
the corresponding canonical momenta coordinatizing the bre, via the trivialization
t g = g  g. (g is the co-lie algebra associated with g.) in the quantum theory, one
denes the algebra of functions f un(t g) on t g. this is the algebra of operators for
the rigid rotor, and it is generated by elements of g and their conjugate momenta. the
algebra is easily enlarged to include the current algebra of the left and right invariant
one forms.

our task is to nd i) a deformation of f un(t g) to an algebra b where g is replaced
by gq, and then ii) enlarge that algebra to include the left and right invariant one forms.
for the latter, the existence of an exterior derivative is assumed with the usual leibniz
rule. (for an alternative to the usual leibniz rule, see [10].) we shall carry out i) and ii)
for quantum groups gq having a bicovariant calculus. with regard to i), deformations
of f un(t g) known as heisenberg doubles exist for a large class of quantum groups,
which do not necessarily possess a bicovariant calculus.[11] we instead nd it convenient
to write down a deformation algebra b exclusively for quantum groups which posses a
bicovariant calculus, as it is easily extended to the bimodule. a bicovariant calculus
is characterized by braiding matrices, structure constants, as well as the r matrices
for gq, and we express b directly in terms of these constants. the algebra is shown
to be consistent with associativity, and although it is not in general a hopf algebra, it
contains three hopf subalgebras: the quantum group gq, as well as two algebras al and
ar which are deformations of the lie algebra associated with g. al and ar contain
the analogues of generators of the left and right actions of lie groups, which we denote
by {i} and {ri}, respectively. these algebras commute with each other, and they may
or may not be isomorphic. (we nd them to be isomorphic for simple examples, like
gq = uq(2).) their center elements are shown to coincide. all of the above properties
of b are shared by the heisenberg double[11] , and most likely any b is equivalent to
some quantum double. as stated earlier, using b we can easily carry out step ii), i.e.
extend the algebra to include the left and right invariant one forms. in this regard we get
that {i} commutes with the left invariant one form, and {ri} commutes with the right
invariant one form, as in the undeformed case. the remaining commutation relations
can be expressed in terms of deformed commutators.

the work presented here sets the stage for a variety of generalizations of quantum
systems, such as wess-zumino-witten models and gauge theories, to ones based on
quantum groups. with regard to the latter, we propose a simple generalization of the
gauss law commutation relations. we nd that the resulting algebra is associative
only for a certain restricted class of deformations, known as minimal[8]. for such
deformations we express the gauss law in terms of the analogue of potentials and electric
elds and specify their algebra. we plan to explore its consequences in future works.

we rst review the algebra f un(t g) of functions on the cotangent bundle t g
associated with lie group g. it is generated by group elements, along with elements
of the lie algebra. for the former one can write matrices [t a
b] in the fundamental
representation.  the latter, which we denote by ri (or i) are the generators of right (or

we now show that there is a completely analogous structure for quantum groups gq
which admit a bicovariant calculus in the sense of woronowicz[1]. quantum groups can
be thought of as deformations of the (commutative) hopf algebra f un(g) of functions
on a lie group g. the deformation of f un(g) to a noncommutative hopf algebra gq
depends on at least one deformation parameter q, and reduces to f un(g) in the limit
q  1. the hopf algebra is generated by quantum group matrices for which we again
use the notation t . their coproduct is the usual one: (t a
b, and they
satisfy commutation relations:

b) = t a

(14)

r obeys the yang-baxter equation, and this is consistent with having an associative
algebra for the matrix elements t a
b. we want to enlarge this algebra to an associative
algebra b which is a deformation of f un(t g). for this we reintroduce elements ri,
which now are the analogues of the right generators on the group. for their commutation
relations we take:

which, along with (14), generalize (1-3). eq.

constants. for q  1, km
i . for q 6= 1, the structure constants are not in general
antisymmetric, and do not obey the usual jacobi identities. in systems where there is a
bicovariant calculus, one has the following identities for km

the rst condition is the yang baxter equation, the second is the analogue of the jacobi
identity, while the last two equations are trivial in the limit q  1. from the above
conditions the ris (alone) generate a non cocommutative hopf algebra ar. f j

in eq. (16) are matrices with c-number coecients. f j

the second equation states that {[i]a
c}  denes a matrix representation (the funda-
mental representation) of a deformed lie algebra. (from (15) this is not, in general, the
algebra generated by the ris. rather, as we shall show shortly, it is the algebra gener-
ated by the analogue of the left generators is.) eqs. (21-24) can be viewed as dening
an operator algebra for i and f i
j . in addition to the assumption of the existence of a
fundamental matrix representation for i and f i
j , eqs. (17-20) show that that there is
another representation (the adjoint representation) for this algebra. it is obtained by
setting i = adji and f i

j = adjf i

j , where

[adj i] j

(25)

with the help of the bicovariant calculus, i.e. the conditions (17-20), (21-24) and
the yang-baxter equation for r, one can show that the algebra generated by t a
b and
ri is consistent with an associative algebra. for example, if we consider the trinomial
t rirj (for simplicity, we suppress the matrix indices on t ), by repeated usage of (15)
and (16), t can be commuted all the way to the right in two dierent ways:

t rirj = (rkt f k

ji (rnt f n

 + t )m + cm

ji(rnt f n

 + t )

(26)

(27)

equating the right hand sides of (26) and (27) leads to no new conditions. rather, (26)
and (27) are identical upon using the bicovariance conditions (21-24).

another ingredient for a bicovariant calculus is the analogue of the adjoint matrix
i  m j
k .

j which now have values in f unq(g). its coproduct is (m j

i ) = m k

elements m i
the analogue of relation (4), i.e.

when writing the elements of a matrix, it is understood that the left most index labels the rows,

while the right most one labels the columns.

(31)

generalizing (5) and (6). they are the commutation relations (14) and (16) written in
the adjoint representation (25). now dene the analogue of the left generators on the
group i = rjm j

i . from (28) and (29), we get

t i  jf j

i t = it

(32)

generalizing (9). it is easy to check that i commute with rj as in the undeformed case:

irk = rjm j
= (mj

i = rkrnm n

i = rki

i rk = rj (mj

nk rmm n

where we used (15) and (31). the generalization of commutation relations (8) can then
be obtained

(34)

where we again used (10) which remains valid in the deformed case. we also note
that (10) corresponds to (28) written in the adjoint representation. from (34), the left
generators satisfy the same commutation relations as the is in (22). the is therefore
provide a matrix representation for the is. it is the fundamental representation and
thus irreducible.

the is (alone) generate a non cocommutative hopf algebra al which is, in general,
distinct from the hopf algebra ar generated by the ris. however, their centers, if they
exist, coincide. for example, if one of the generators of al, say 0, belongs to the center
of al, then it also belongs to the center of ar. to see this, we note by schurs lemma
that the fundamental matrix representation 0 of 0 is a multiple of the identity. then
by (28)

(35)

assuming linear independence of the is, m j
0 times the unit i of the algebra
gq (which in fact we assume to be the same as the unit of the full algebra b). this then

t 0 = 0t = t jm j
0
0 is just j

7

implies that 0 = rjm j
0 = r0, and since all is commute with elements of ar, r0 must
be in its center. similarly, we can show that if cl is a quadratic casimir for al, it is
also a quadratic casimir for ar. in this regard, let us write

cl = hijij

(36)

hij being c-numbers, and unlike in the undeformed case, hij is not, in general, symmetric.
then by schurs lemma hijij is a multiple of the identity, and

t hijij = hijij t = hijt km 

i m k

j

this is solved by

hki = hijm 

i m k

j

we can use this to write cl as a binomial in ri as follows:

cl = hijirkm k
= hijrkrm 

j = hijrkim k
j = hkrkr
i m k

j

(37)

(38)

(39)

since (36) commutes with ri, cr = hkrkr is a casimir for ar. it is a natural choice for
the hamiltonian of a q-rigid rotor. the above procedure can be repeated for any higher
order casimirs.

finally, let us enlarge our algebra b to include a bimodule . one then assumes the
existence of an exterior derivative d which maps gq to , and following[1] satises the
usual leibniz rule. we next introduce the left and right invariant one forms. we dene
them as in (11). they obey the maurer-cartan equations:

dl + l  l = 0
dr  r  r = 0

(40)

if we postulate that dt has the same commutation relations with i and ri as does
t , it then follows that l commutes with i, and r commutes with ri, as in the
undeformed case. for the latter, multiply dt ri  rjdt f j
i = dt i on the right by t 1
and rit 1  t 1rjt f j
i t 1 = it 1 on the left by dt , and then take the dierence to
nd

[r , rj] t f j

i t 1 = 0

(41)

the result that r and rj commute follows using the existence of an antipode (f k
j )[6],
where (f k
i .  is the co-unit, which for us is just the unit
matrix in the dening representation. the nonvanishing commutation relations of the
generators i and ri with the left and right invariant one forms are

i ) =  k

i = f k

j ) f j

[l , rj (f j

i )] = [l , j (f j

generalizing (12). once again, the components i
the second equation in (43) one can substitute (13) into [i

l, j] = 0.

r are related by (13). to derive

this system suggests a natural generalization to gauge theories based on quantum
groups. this was pursued in [8],[9] from the lagrangian perspective.  here we view
the theory from the hamiltonian perspective. for this one can now drop the zero
curvature conditions (40), and let l (or r) denote arbitrary connection one forms.
from (43), ri (or i) generate global transformations. following castellani[8], if we
introduce innitesimal parameters i, which are not c-numbers, innitesimal variations
of the one forms i

l can be expressed by

i

l = [i

l, rj]q j = ci

kj k

lj

(44)

a natural question concerns the generators of local or gauge transformations, i.e. the
analogue of the gauss law constraints. from [8], local quantum group transformations
are of the form

i

l = di  ci

kj k

lj ,

(45)

where the innitesimal parameters i are now functions on space-time, which is consid-
ered here as a commuting manifold. the gauss law generators gi and space components
ai
l are also functions on space-time. the equal time commutator of gauss law
generators with ai

 should now include a central term

 of i

the gauss law constraints should form a closed algebra if they are to be rst class. a
natural choice is a q-lie algebra at every point in space:

gi(x)gj(y)  mn

ji gn(y)gm(x) = ck

jigk(x)(x  y) .

(47)

however, the algebra generated by ai
in fact,
the algebra for the gauss law generators alone is, in general, nonassociative. on the

 and gj is, in general, nonassociative.

gauge theories based on quantum groups were also studied on the lattice. [12],[13] the continuum
limit for these theories is nontrivial. on the other hand, in [8],[9] and what follows one works directly
on the continuum.

9

other hand, it can be checked that associativity is recovered for the so-called minimal
deformations[8][9], where

ij

kk

mn = i

mj

n

(48)

one can wonder if the gauss law can be expressed in terms of some analogue of the
electric elds 
i , similar to what is done in the underformed case. this should at least
be possible in the minimal case. we thus write:

gi(x) = 



x


i (x) + ck

ji

k (x)aj

(x)

to recover the derivative term in (46) one then needs

[ai

(x), 

j (y)]q  ai

(x)

j (y)  ki

j 

k (y)a

(x) = i

j 

 (x  y)

(49)

(50)

giving a deformation of the canonical commutation relations. for the remaining term in
(46) one needs

cm
jni

km ak

(x)a

(y) = cn

mkki

j am

 (y)a

(x)

(51)

this is indeed valid for the minimal case if one chooses the following commutation
relations for the gauge potentials:

ak

(x)a

(y) = k

mj am

 (y)aj

(x)

(52)

which agree with those found in [8]. concerning the commutation relations between the
electric elds, this can be obtained (for minimal deformations) by again appealing to
associativity. the algebra of the operators ai

j is associative for

 and 


i (x)

j (y) = k

ji 

 (y)

k (x)

(53)

from the above discussion, it may appear that gauge theories based on quantum
groups are possible only for minimal deformations. this is consistent with the result
found in [8] that the set of gauge transformations (45) closes only for such deformations.
for us, minimality was needed to make the algebra generated by gi(x), satisfying (47),
be associative. on the other hand, (47) may be too simple a generalization of the
global symmetry algebra dened by (15). a less restrictive choice would have space-
dependent braiding matrices, r-matrices and structure constants. more precisely, gi(x)
can be regarded as right generators having both a continuous and discrete index, whose
corresponding braiding matrices  and structure constants c have the simple form

(mz) (nw)

(jy) (ix) = mn

ji (x  z) (y  w)

c(kz)
(jy) (ix) = ck

ji (x  z) (x  y)

(54)

this choice is consistent with the bicovariance conditions if (48) is satised. whether or
not one can have a more general expression for  and c would be of interest. moreover,

10

it is perhaps also too restrictive to require that space-time denes a normal manifold,
when this is not the case for the target manifold. possibly, a more general class of
gauge theories based on quantum groups can be developed if one is able to drop this
requirement as well.
