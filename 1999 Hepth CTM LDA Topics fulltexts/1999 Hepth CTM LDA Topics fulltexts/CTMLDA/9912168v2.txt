1 introduction

the study of superconformal algebras has recently attracted renewed interest
for their dual role in the adsd+1/cftd correspondence [1, 2, 3], connected
to the near-horizon geometry of d  1-branes.

a special role is played by 3-branes since they are related to supercon-
formal invariant quantum yang-mills theories. these theories are the only
ones exhibiting conformal symmetry both at weak and strong coupling and,
in any case, admitting, unlike other types of branes, yang-mills elds in the
conformal regime.

the bulk and boundary operators in this correspondence are classied by
highest weight uirs of su(2, 2/n) algebras [4, 5] where n = 1, 2 and 4 in
the known examples, since supergravity or superstring theory can admit at
most 32 (8n) supersymmetries. nevertheless, in the study of superconfor-
mal algebras and their representations dierent values of n are of interest
because they help one to exhibit some general features of short representa-
tions, corresponding to conformal operators with protected dimension, but
more importantly, because these algebras may be relevant for some general-
izations of the known schemes in which more than 32 supersymmetries may
be required [6].

recently [7] it has been shown that a known generalization of ordinary
superspace, called harmonic superspace [8]-[11], is particularly suitable
to build up, in a rather simple and general manner, all possible composite
operators of superconformal invariant gauge theories with n > 1 extended
supersymmetry.

other approaches, like ordinary superspace [12, 13] or the oscillator con-
struction [14]-[16] of highest weight representations, although in principle
possible, are much more complicated to deal with and the complete analysis
of all possible shortenings would be unnecessarily dicult.

in fact, the structure of harmonic superspace is powerful enough to allow
[7] to all su(2, 2/n) superalgebras with

us to extend the analysis of ref.
arbitrary n, although no dynamical theory is known for n > 4.

from a mathematical point of view harmonic superspace is an enlarged

space where superelds are dened on ag manifolds [11, 17]

m =

su(n)

s (u(n1)  . . .  u(np))

,

  p
xk=1

nk = n! .

to study the general case of short multiplets it is important [7] (see also
section 3.2 and 4 for details) to use the choice nk = 1 (k = 1 . . . n), i.e.
where we quotient the group su(n) by its maximal torus. then the above
manifold is the largest ag manifold with complex dimension n(n  1)/2.
the ultrashort uirs of su(2, 2/n) superalgebras correspond to mass-
less supermultiplets. a certain class of the latter can be described [11] by
analytic harmonic superelds depending only on half of the odd coordinates
(grassmann or g-analyticity [18]):

w 12...k = w 12...k(k+1, k+2, . . . , n , 1, 2, . . . , k) .

(2)

in addition, they are annihilated by all the step-up generators ea in the
cartan decomposition of the lie algebra of su(n). in other words, these
superelds correspond to highest weight states of su(n):

ea|hwi = 0 .

(3)

in harmonic superspace this irreducibility condition corresponds to harmonic
(or h-) analyticity. the crucial point is that the su(2, 2/n) algebra acting
on such states denes a quasi-primary superconformal eld denoted by

d(, j1, j2; r; a1, . . . , an 1)

(4)

where , j1, j2 are the conformal dimension and spin of the state, r is the
u(1) r charge and a1, . . . , an 1 are the su(n) dynkin labels. we assign
the r charge r = 1
n ) to the grassmann coordinates in order to be
consistent with the convention that chiral superelds () have l = r for
any n. this is also the charge which naturally appears in the denition of
the su(2, 2/n) superalgebra [19]. 1

2(1  4

2 ]), have r charge rk = 2k

the g- and h-analytic superelds (2) have their lowest (scalar) com-
ponent belonging to the rank k antisymmetric representation of su(n)
(k = 1 . . . [ n
n  1 and will be shown to describe
ultrashort representations of the su(2, 2/n) superalgebra. if the algebra
is interpreted as acting on ads5, these are the supersingleton representa-
tions [22]. for k = 0 the supereld is actually chiral and in this case the
highest weight state may carry a spin label (jl, 0) with  = 1+jl. the chiral

1note that for n = 4, r = 0 and the r quantum number becomes a central charge
[20, 21]. in this case the analysis of section 2 refers to the p su (2, 2/4) algebra for r = 0
and to the p u (2, 2/4) algebra for r 6= 0.

supereld is the supersingleton representation when the top spin is jl = n
2 .
for all other analytic superelds (k > 1) the supersingleton will have top
spin jl = n

2  k
2 .

it should be pointed out that the same massless multiplets can be de-
scribed in terms of ordinary but constrained superelds [12, 13]. the reason
why we prefer the harmonic superspace version is the fact that the super-
elds (2) are unconstrained analytic objects. analyticity is a property which
is preserved by multiplication. this will allow us to tensor the above mass-
less uirs in a very simple way and thus obtain series of short multiplets of
su(2, 2/n). 2 we observe that from the ads5 point of view, tensoring more
than two supersingleton reps produces massive bulk reps, while tensoring
only two of them produces massless bulk reps [22, 16]. the latter are the
supercurrent multiplets discussed in ref. [13].

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we review the shortening
conditions for su(2, 2/n) superalgebras. in section 3 we introduce the ap-
propriate harmonic superspaces and construct the g- and h-analytic super-
elds which, together with ordinary chiral superelds, describe all massless
representations of su(2, 2/n).
in section 4 we construct all short opera-
tors corresponding to tensor products of the self-conjugate supersingleton 3
multiplet of su(2, 2/2n).

2 unitarity bounds and shortening of uirs

of su (2, 2/n )

the unitarity bounds of highest weight uirs of su(2, 2/n) have been de-
rived in refs.
[24, 20, 21, 25]. they correspond to some bounds on the
highest weight state (4). let us dene the quantities

2series of operators obtained by tensoring the n = 4 super-yang-mills eld strength
considered as a g-analytic harmonic supereld were introduced in [23]. they were identi-
ed with short multiplets of su (2, 2/4) and their correspondence with the k-k spectrum
of iib supergravity was established in [5].

3self-conjugate here means that the highest weight state is in the self-conjugate rep of
sl(2, c)  u (2n): j1 = j2 = r = 0, n-fold antisymmetric. this rep is real (pseudoreal)
when n is even (odd).

3 massless superconformal multiplets

3.1 grassmann analytic superelds

we consider superelds

w i1...ik(x , 

i ,  i)

with k = 1, . . . , n (where n = [ n
2 ]) totally antisymmetrized indices in the
fundamental representation of su(n). these superelds satisfy the following
constraints:

d(j
 w i1)i2...ik = 0 ,
d {jw i1}i2...ik = 0

4

(11)
(12)

where () means symmetrization and {} means the traceless part. the spinor
derivatives algebra is

{di

, d j} = ii

j 

(13)

 .

with   = 
in the cases n = 2, 3, 4 these constraints dene the
on-shell n = 2 matter (hyper)multiplet [26] and the n = 3, 4 on-shell super-
yang-mills multiplets [27]. their generalization to arbitrary n has been
given in refs.
[12, 13] where it has also been shown that they describe
on-shell massless multiplets.

our aim in this section is to rewrite the constraints (11), (12) in harmonic
superspace where they will take the simple form of analyticity conditions.
using this fact we will then be able to construct tensor products of the
corresponding multiplets in a very straightforward and easy way (section 4).
the main purpose of introducing harmonics is to be able to covariantly
project all the su(n) indices in (11), (12) onto a set of u(1) charges. to
this end we choose the harmonic coset su(n)/(u(1))n 1 described in terms
4 they form
of harmonic variables ui
an su(n) matrix where i is an index in the fundamental representation of
su(n) and i = 1, . . . , n is a collection of the n  1 u(1) charges corre-
sponding to the projections of the second index (the harmonic ui
i carries
charges opposite to those of ui
i ). they satisfy the following su(n) dening
conditions:

i and their conjugates ui

i = (ui

i ).

u  su(n) :

j = i

i ui
j ,
i uj
i = j
ui
i ,
i1...in u1
i1 . . . un

in = 1 .

(14)
(15)
(16)

now, let us use these harmonic variables to split all the su(n) indices
in the constraints (11), (12) into independent (u(1))n 1 projections. for
example, the projection

w 12...k = w i1i2...iku1

i1u2

i2 . . . uk

satises the constraints

w 12...k = d2

d  k+1w 12...k = d  k+2w 12...k = . . . = d  n w 12...k = 0

w 12...k = . . . = dk

w 12...k = 0 ,

(17)

(18)
(19)

4the harmonic notation used here diers from the original one of refs.

[8, 9]. it is
similar to the one introduced in ref. [10] for the case n = 3 and in refs. [11] for general
n .

ui

 = di

i and d  i = d  iui

where di
(18), is
a corollary of the commuting nature of the harmonics variables, and the
second one, eq. (19), of the unitarity condition (14). the main achievement
in rewriting the constraints (11), (12) in this new form is that they can be
explicitly solved by going to an appropriate g-analytic basis in superspace:

(20)

in this basis w 12...k becomes an unconstrained function of k s and n  k
s:

w 12...k = w 12...k(xa, k+1, . . . , n , 1, . . . , k, u) .

(21)

altogether it depends on half the number of the odd variables of n-extended
superspace and for this reason we call it grassmann (or g-) analytic. we
recall that the notion of grassmann analyticity was introduced in ref. [18]
in the context of ordinary superspace. in n = 2 harmonic superspace [8] this
notion became su(2) covariant. the generalization to n = 3 was given in
ref. [9] and later on to arbitrary n in refs. [11] under the name of (n, p, q)
superspace. the massless multiplets of the type (21) were studied in the
rst of refs.
[11] where they were identied with (n, k, n  k) g-analytic
superelds.

the massless conformal multiplets describe the ordinary massless uirs of
the super poincare group obtained earlier by the wigner method of induced
representations (see, for instance, ref.
[28]). the self-conjugate n = 8
multiplet was obtained by the oscillator method in ref. [29].

3.2 harmonic analyticity as su (n ) irreducibility

it is important to realize that a g-analytic supereld is an su(n) co-
variant object only because it depends on the harmonic variables.
in or-
der to recover the original harmonic-independent but constrained supereld
w i1i2...ik (x, , ) (11), (12) we need to impose dierential conditions involv-
ing the harmonic variables. the harmonic derivatives are made out of the
operators

j = ui
 i

i

 ui
j


uj
i


ui
i

(22)

which respect the dening relations (14), (15). these derivatives act on the
harmonics as follows:

i
j uk

i = k

j ui

i ,

i
j ui

k = i

kui

j .

the diagonal ones  i

i count the u(1) charges,

 i
i ui

i = ui
i ,

 i
i ui

i = ui

i .

(23)

(24)

the relation (16) implies that the charge operators  i

i are not independent,

 i
i = 0

n

xi=1

(25)

(this reects the fact that we are considering su(n) and not u(n)).

a basic assumption in our approach to the harmonic coset su(n)/u(1)n 1
is that any harmonic function is homogeneous under the action of u(1)n 1,
i.e., it is an eigenfunction of the charge operators  i
i ,

i f k1...kq
 i

l1...lr (u) = (k1

i + . . . + kq

i  i

l1  . . .  i

lr )f k1...kq

l1...lr (u)

(26)

(note that the charges k1 . . . kq; l1 . . . lr are not necessarily all dierent).
thus it eectively depends on the (n 2  1)  (n  1) = n(n  1) real coor-
dinates of the coset su(n)/u(1)n 1. then the actual harmonic derivatives
on the coset are the n(n  1)/2 complex derivatives  i
j , i < j (or their
conjugates  i

j , i > j).

j (taking into account the linear dependence

the set of n 21 derivatives  i
(25)) form the algebra of su(n):

[ i

j ,  k

l ] = k

j  i

l  i

l k

j

.

(27)

the cartan decomposition of this algebra l+ + l0 + l is given by the sets

l+ = { i

j , i < j} , l0 = { i
i ,

n

xi=1

i = 0} , l = { i
 i

j , i > j} .

let us now impose the harmonic dierential constraints

j f k1...kq
 i

l1...lr (u) = 0 ,

i < j

7

(28)

(29)

on a harmonic function with a given set of charges k1 . . . kq; l1 . . . lr. this
equation has two types of solutions: either it denes the highest weight of an
su(n) irrep or the solution is trivial if the charges are such that they do not
match any highest weight state (see examples of both cases in (32) and (33)).
in other words, the harmonic expansion of such a function contains only one
irrep which is determined by the combination of charges k1 . . . kq; l1 . . . lr.
in fact, not all of the derivatives  i
j , i < j are independent, as follows from
the algebra (27). the independent set consists of the n  1 derivatives

 1
2 ,  2

3 , . . . ,  n 1

n

(30)

corresponding to the simple roots of su(n). then the su(n) dening
constraint (29) is equivalent to

i+1f k1...kq
 i

l1...lr (u) = 0 ,

i = 1, . . . , n  1 .

(31)

the coset su(n)/u(1)n 1 can be parametrized by n(n  1)/2 complex
coordinates.
in this case the constraints (29) take the form of covariant
(in the sense of cartan) cauchy-riemann analyticity conditions. for this
reason we call the set of constraints (29) (or the equivalent set (31)) harmonic
(h-)analyticity conditions. the above argument shows that h-analyticity
is equivalent to dening a highest weight of su(n), i.e.
it is the su(n)
irreducibility condition on the harmonic functions.

as an example, take n = 2 and the function f 1(u) subject to the con-

straint

 1
2 f 1(u) = 0  f 1(u) = f iu1
i .

(32)

so, the harmonic function is reduced to a doublet of su(2). another exam-
ple, still in n = 2, is the harmonic equation

2 f 2(u) = 0  f 2(u) = 0
 1

(33)

since f 2 is the lowest weight state of a doublet, and not the highest weight
one. similarly, for n = 4 the function f 12(u) is reduced to the 6 of su(4).
4 f 12(u) = 0 ensure that f 12(u) depends
indeed, the constraints  2
on u1, u2 only, f 12(u) = f iju1
j = 0
implies f ij = f ji.

j . then the constraint  1

2 f 12(u) = f iju1

3 f 12(u) =  3

i u2

i u1

in the g-analytic basis (20) the harmonic derivatives become covariant

d i

j . in particular, the derivatives

d i

j  i

j

i    j i + i j ,

i = 1, . . . , k, j = k + 1, . . . , n (34)

acquire space-time derivative terms. the su(n) commutation relations
among the d i
j are not aected by the change of basis. the same is true
for the commutation relations of the d i

j with the spinor derivatives:
j , d  k] = i

d  j .

k

[d i

(35)

(36)

(37)

[d i

j , dk

 ] = k

j di

 ,

using these relations one can see that the h-analyticity conditions

d i

j w 12...k = 0 ,

i < j

or the equivalent set

d i

i+1w 12...k = 0 ,

i = 1, . . . , n  1

are compatible with the g-analyticity ones (19).

we remark that in [11] analytic superelds of the above type are dened
on the harmonic coset su(n)/u(1) su(k) su(n k) rather than on the
maximal one, su(n)/[u(1)]n 1 that we are considering. the explanation is
as follows 5. it is easy to see that besides the harmonic constraints (37), the
supereld w 12...k automatically satises the additional ones

d i+1

i w 12...k = 0 ,

i = 1, . . . , k  1, k + 1, . . . , n  1 .

(38)

the derivatives in (38) form a subset of the lowering operators of su(n),
such that together with the corresponding raising operators and charges they
generate the subgroup su(k)  su(n  k)  su(n). this fact can be
interpreted as extending the factor [u(1)]n 2 in the coset denominator to
su(k)  su(n  k). so, w 12...k eectively lives on a smaller harmonic
space. although this is true for an individual w , for the purpose of tensoring
dierent realizations of it we shall need our formulation on the maximal coset
(see section 4).

3.3 analyticity and massless multiplets

the constraints of h-analyticity (36) combined with those of g-analyticity
(19) have important implications for the components of the supereld. first
of all, they make each component an irrep of su(n). take, for example, the
rst component

12...k(x, u) = w 12...k|0

(39)

5we thank p. howe for this remark.

9

where |0 means  =  = 0. the constraints  i
k, . . . , n  1 imply that 12...k(x, u) takes the form

i+112...k(x, u) = 0, i =

12...k(x, u) = i1i2...ik(x)u1

i1u2

i2 . . . uk

ik .

this is a rank k tensor without any symmetry, i.e. a reducible representation
of su(n). further, the constraint, e.g.,

2 123...k(x, u) = 113...k(x, u) = i1i2i3...iku1
1

i1u1

i2u3

i3 . . . un

ik = 0

removes the symmetric part in the rst two indices. similarly, the remain-
ing constraints (36) remove all the symmetrizations and we nd the totally
antisymmetric rank k irrep of su(n).

another example are the spinor components

12...k k+1



(x, u) = dk+1

 w 12...k|0 ,

23...k



(x, u) = d1 w 12...k|0 .

(40)

the same harmonic argument shows that these are harmonic projections of
the totally antisymmetric components [i1i2...ik+1]

(x).
further important constraints occur at the level of 2 or more s:

(x) and [i2i3...ik]





didj
di  d 

w 12...k = 0 ,
j w 12...k = 0 ,

i, j = k + 1, . . . , n ,
i, j = 1, . . . , k .

(41)
(42)

the easiest way to see this is to hit the dening constraint (11) with dk
and then project with harmonics.

the constraints (41), (42) imply that the components of the type

1...k+p
p w 12...k|0 ,
(1...p) = dk+1
p+1...k
( 1... p) = d1 1 . . . dp pw 12...k|0 ,

p  n  k

p  k

(43)

(44)

are totally symmetric in their spinor indices, i.e. they carry spin (p/2, 0) or
(0, p/2), correspondingly. among them one nds the

top spin ( n

2  k

2 , 0): (1...n k) = dk+1

1

. . . dn

n k w 12...k|0

(45)

which is also an su(n) singlet. note that in the case n = 2n, k = n the
top spin occurs both as (n/2, 0) and (0, n/2) (we call this a self-conjugate
multiplet). moreover, if n = 4n and k = 2n one can impose a reality
condition on the supereld w 12...2n which implies, in particular, that

(1...2n) = (( 1... 2n)) .

(46)

10

next, one can show that all the components of the type (43), (44) sat-
indeed, from the constraint (41) and from

isfy massless eld equations.

series of section 2. it is characterized by the su(n) irrep of the rst com-

3.4 chiral superelds
the g-analytic superelds considered above contain at least one . the case
of extreme g-analyticity will be the absence of any s. these are the
well-known chiral superelds [30] satisfying the constraint

di w = 0  w = w (x 

l , 
i )

where

x 
l = x   i

(54)

(55)

note that in this case we do not need harmonic variables, since g-analyticity
involves a subset of odd coordinates forming an entire irrep of su(n), and
not a set of u(1) projections. consequently, in order to put such a supereld
on shell, we cannot use h-analyticity but need to impose a new type of
constraint [13]:

d idj

w = 0 .

4 short superconformal multiplets

in this section we shall concentrate on the case n = 2n for reasons of sim-
plicity. the analytic supereld w 12...n(n+1, . . . , 2n, 1, . . . , n) describes a
superconformal multiplet characterized by the young tableau m1 = . . . =
mn = 1, mn+1 = . . . = m2n1 = 0 of its rst component (a lorentz scalar),
by its dimension  = 1 and r charge r = 0 (see (53)). now we shall use this
multiplet as a building block for constructing other short superconformal
multiplets.

the building block w 12...n can be equivalently rewritten by choosing dif-
ferent harmonic projections of its su(n) indices and, consequently, dierent
sets of g-analyticity constraints. this amounts to superelds of the type

w i1i2...in(j1, . . . , jn, i1, . . . , in)

(58)

where i1, . . . , in and j1, . . . , jn are two complementary sets of n indices. each
of these superelds depends on 2n = 4n grassmann variables, i.e. half of the
total number of 4n = 8n. this is the minimal size of a g-analytic superspace,
so we can say that the w s are the shortest superelds (superconformal
multiplets). another characteristic of these w s is the absence of r charges.
note that each of the superelds (58) satises dierent sets of h-analyticity
constraints equivalent to (37). these sets are chosen in a way to be compati-
ble with the dierent g-analyticities in (58). in other words, this corresponds
to changing the su(n) basis.

the idea now is to start multiplying dierent species of the w s of the
type (58) in order to obtain composite objects depending on various numbers
of odd variables. the sets i1, . . . , in can be chosen in (2n)!/(n!)2 dierent
ways. however, we do not need consider all of them. the following choice of
w s and of the order of multiplication covers all possible intermediate types
of g-analyticity:

a(p1, p2, . . . , p2n1) =

[w 1...n(n+1...2n 1...n)]p1+...+p2n1

13

[w 1...n1 n+1(n n+2...2n 1...n1 n+1)]p2+...+p2n1
[w 1...n1 n+2(n n+1 n+3...2n 1...n1 n+2)]p3+...+p2n1
  
[w 1...n1 2n1(n...2n2 2n 1...n1 2n1)]pn+...+p2n1
[w 1...n2 n n+1(n1 n+2...2n 1...n2 n n+1)]pn+1+...+p2n1
[w 1...n3 n1 n n+1(n2 n+2...2n 1...n3 n1 n n+1)]pn+2+...+p2n1
  
[w 13...n+1(2 n+2...2n
[w 23...n+1(1 n+2...2n 23...n+1)]p2n1 .

13...n+1)]p2n2+p2n1

(59)

the powerp2n1

r=k pr of the k-th w is chosen in such a way that each new
pr corresponds to bringing in a new type of w . as a result, at each step
a new  or  appears (they are underlined in (59)), thus adding new odd
dimensions to the g-analytic superspace. the only exception of this rule is
the second step at which both a new  and a new  appear. so, the series (59)
covers all possible subspaces with 4n, 4n+4, 4n+6, . . . , 8n2 odd coordinates
(notice once again the missing subspace with 4n+2 odd coordinates). in this
sense we can say that the g-analytic supereld a(p1, p2, . . . , p2n1) realizes
a short superconformal multiplet.

like any product of irreps, the supereld a(p1, p2, . . . , p2n1) forms a
reducible representation of su(2, 2/n) and, in particular, of su(n).
in
order to achieve irreducibility, we have to impose h-analyticity constraints.
we choose the set of constraints satised by w 1...n alone,

d i

i+1a(p1, p2, . . . , p2n1) = 0 ,

i = 1, 2, . . . , 2n  1 .

(60)

this is clearly compatible with g-analyticity since the g-analyticity condi-
tions on a generic a(p1, p2, . . . , p2n1) form a subset of these on w 1...n. note
that although each factor in (59) satises additional harmonic constraints of
the type (38) which restrict it to a smaller harmonic coset, this is not true
for the generic product a(p1, p2, . . . , p2n1). the latter lives on the harmonic
space su(n)/[u(1)]n 1, but could be restricted to a subspace for particular
values of the parameters pk.

the rst component of the supereld a(p1, p2, . . . , p2n1) subject to the
constraints (60) forms an irrep of su(n) which characterizes the supermul-
tiplet as a whole. it is described by the following young tableau:

1

2n-1

  

2n-1 m2n1

the top row is lled with indices projected with u1
i (hence the symmetriza-
tion among them), the second row - with u2
i , etc. the harmonic conditions
(60) remove all the symmetrizations among indices belonging to dierent
projections (rows). by counting the number of occurrences of the projection
1 in (59), we easily nd the relation

m1 =   p2n1

(61)

where  is the total number of w s (equal to the dimension of the supereld
a, since w = 1). another simple counting shows the relation

mk = n =

n
2

 .

2n1

xk=1

(62)

if the last w in (60) is not present there is an additional relation among the
young tableau labels:

p2n1 = 0  m1 =

2n1

xk=1

mk .

(63)

finally, introducing the dynkin labels [a1, . . . , a2n1] where a1 = m2n1

and ak = m2nk+1  m2nk for k  2, we nd

a1 =

in the present paper we have studied massless multiplets of su(2, 2/n) de-
scribed by analytic harmonic superelds. they correspond to ultrashort
superconformal multiplets with maximal spin jtop = ( n
2 ].
in the case n = 2n, by multiplying dierent but equivalent multiplets with
k = n we constructed a 2n  1 parameter series of short composite opera-
tors. these shortenings are characterized by analytic subspaces of harmonic
superspace which do not involve a certain number of  (fermionic) variables.
if we denote by (nl, nr) the numbers of missing two-component s and s,
respectively, then we nd the following top spin in the expansion of the short
multiplet:
