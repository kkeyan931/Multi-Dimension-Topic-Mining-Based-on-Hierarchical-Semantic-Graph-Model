abstract

i discuss the properties of the central charges c and a for higher-derivative and higher-spin
theories (spin 2 included). ordinary gravity does not admit a straightforward identication
of c and a in the trace anomaly, because it is not conformal. on the other hand, higher-

derivative theories can be conformal, but have negative c and a. a third possibility is to
consider higher-spin conformal eld theories. they are not unitary, but have a variety of
interesting properties. bosonic conformal tensors have a positive-denite action, equal to
the square of a eld strength, and a higher-derivative gauge invariance. there exists a
conserved spin-2 current (not the canonical stress tensor) dening positive central charges c

and a. i calculate the values of c and a and study the operator-product structure. higher-
spin conformal spinors have no gauge invariance, admit a standard denition of c and a and
can be coupled to abelian and non-abelian gauge elds in a renormalizable way. at the
quantum level, they contribute to the one-loop beta function with the same sign as ordinary
matter, admit a conformal window and non-trivial interacting xed points. there are

composite operators of high spin and low dimension, which violate the ferraragattogrillo
theorem. finally, other theories, such as conformal antisymmetric tensors, exhibit more
severe internal problems. this research is motivated by the idea that fundamental quantum
eld theories should be renormalization-group (rg) interpolations between ultraviolet and
infrared conformal xed points, and quantum irreversibility should be a general principle of

nature.

1 statement of the problem

in the approach to quantum eld theory as a radiative interpolation between pairs of conformal
xed points (see [1] for a brief survey) important physical information is given by the values
of the central charges c and a at the xed points and their dependence on the energy scale, in
particular the dierences cuv  cir and auv  air. in a conformal theory, c and a are dened
by the trace anomaly computed in the presence of an external gravitational eld. the quantity
c multiplies the square of the weyl tensor w 2
 and is the coecient of the two-point function
of the stress tensor. the quantity a multiplies the euler density g4 = rr.
a third term, r, is multiplied by a coecient a:

 =

1

(4)2(cid:20)cw 2 +

a
4

g4 

2
3

ar(cid:21) .

(1.1)

in various uv-free supersymmetric models it is possible to compute c and a exactly in the ir
limit [2]. in classically conformal renormalizable theories, a simple non-perturbative formula
for the total rg ow of a [3] holds, which shows the phenomenon of quantum irreversibility
(the inequality auv  air) [3, 4, 5]. the quantity a is interpreted as a counter of the massless
degrees of freedom.

a natural problem is to study the generalization of these results to higher-spin elds, gravity
in particular. it is not straightforward to dene the central charges c and a for gravity or higher-
spin elds, because they are not conformal. the trace anomaly for higher-spin elds was studied
by christensen and du [6] long ago and contains the square of the ricci curvature r :

a sign that the eld is not conformal. the denition of c and a from the trace anomaly is
unambiguous only if there is no such term. explicitly, for spin 3/2 and spin 2 we nd, from
table ii of ref. [6] (omitting the r-term):

3/2 =

we see that the graviton and gravitino contributions to the r2-term have opposite signs. this
means that a suitable combination of gravitons and gravitinos can cancel the r2-term and might
dene a good higher-spin generalization of conformal eld theory. it would be interesting to
have a comprehensive list of the theories with vanishing r2-term, starting from the analysis of
christensen and du, and understand if they can be considered conformal for all purposes. the
disappearance of the r2-term is a necessary condition, but might not be sucient. observe,
however, that it is not simple to construct manifestly gauge-invariant stress tensors for higher-
spin elds and the r2-term might depend on the denition, the gauge-xing or the scheme

2

choice. on the other hand, the conformal higher-spin elds, which are studied in this paper,
have better properties in connection with these issues.

if sensible denitions of c and a are not separately available, it might be interesting to look
for an appropriate generalization of the subclass of conformal eld theories that have c = a.
these theories share various properties with two-dimensional conformal eld theory [5]. we
see that the dierence c  a multiplies the unique term containing the riemann tensor in the
trace anomaly, r2
 in the trace anomaly. an appropriate denition of c = a theories of
gravitons and gravitinos, or higher-spin elds in general, might include the theories whose trace
anomaly contains only r2
. in arbitrary even dimensions the trace
anomaly of the c = a theories contains the minimal amount of riemann tensors, as shown
in ref.
[5]. however, the c = a theories, certainly mathematically interesting, appear to be
phenomenologically disfavoured (sect. 1.2).

 , r2 and r, but not r2

in general, when do we have sensible denitions of c and a? we rst demand that the
classical theory be conformal, so that no r2-term is present in the trace anomaly. secondly, we
would like that c and a be both positive. negative central charges represent a severe violation
of unitarity. the purpose of this paper is to explore a large variety of theories, old and new,
in this spirit. we begin with higher-derivative theories (section 2) and show that they have
negative c and a. we continue by classifying the higher-spin conformal theories. fermions
admit a straightforward coupling to gravity and gauge elds, so that in this case our program
can be carried over to the end. there is evidence of a conformal window and that these theories
obey the irreversibility property. on the other hand, higher-spin conformal bosons do not admit
a straightforward coupling to gravity. nevertheless, i show that there exists a suitable spin-2
current that has all the features to dene appropriate c and a. i compute their values in a
simple case and show that they are positive.

higher-spin conformal eld theories are not unitary [7], but have a number of interesting
features (of which conformal invariance is just the most important), which makes them inter-
esting either as a laboratory for investigations in the spirit of [1] and the questions raised above,
or for the description of physical phenomena in limited energy ranges. in some cases, they have
a positive-denite action in the euclidean framework. symmetric conformal tensors have a
higher-derivative gauge symmetry, which is investigated in detail. it is the unique gauge trans-
formation compatible with the conformal symmetry. moreover, these theories admit proper
denitions of eld strengths, dual eld strengths, chernsimons forms, topological invariants,
etc.

the non-unitarity of these theories can show up in the negative sign of c or a, as remarked
above. but even when c and a are positive, there might be eects on the anomalous dimensions
of the operators generated by the ope of two stress tensors. for example, the ferraragatto
grillo theorem [9] states that, in a unitary theory, primary composite operators with spin s
should have a total dimension greater than or equal to 2 + s. this theorem is here manifestly
violated. indeed, the higher-derivative gauge invariance allows for multiply-conserved cur-
rents with dimensions  = 2 + s, 1 + s, . . ., 3. some of these operators will be constructed
explicitly.

there have been earlier works on conformal eld equations of spin-2 [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] and
spin-3/2 [15] elds. these theories are particular cases of the ones presented below. to my
knowledge the relationship between conformal invariance and higher-derivative gauge invariance
was not known. recently, related theories have attracted some interest in the domain of nuclear
physics, where the purpose is to account for the hadronic resonances, such as the spin-3/2
(1232) [17, 18]. i believe that the properties outlined here might be useful in this domain,
at least in a denite energy range. the hope is that dynamical eects might make these
theories consistent at low energies, thanks to quantum irreversibility itself (the ghosts might
disappear above the planck length, far before the physically observable degrees of freedom) or
to a generalization of the nachtmann theorem [8].

finally, i remark that the study of higher-spin conformal eld theory is in some sense
complementary to the fradkinvasiliev higher-spin eld theory [10], which is unitary, but not
conformal.

the plan of the paper is as follows. before entering the technical part, i explain in sect. 1.1
the reasons why it is physically attractive to investigate higher-spin theories focusing on c and
a and the irreversibility. section 2 contains observations about higher-derivatives conformal
eld theories and the rest of the paper is about higher-spin conformal eld theories. i present
the bosonic conformal elds in section 3, the fermionic elds in section 5. section 4 is devoted
to a detailed analysis of the spin-2 eld, with computations of c and a and a study of the
operator-product (ope) structure. in section 5 the contribution to the gauge beta function
from conformal spin-3/2 matter fermions is computed.
i work in the euclidean framework
throughout this paper.

1.1 other motivations for the approach suggested here

the search for a consistent formulation of higher-spin elds is dicult, and it might help to
establish some general guidelines. this section is devoted to explaining why the properties
of the central charges c and a and quantum irreversibility might be good for this. the ideas
contained here should be meant as a work hypothesis. they apply to renormalizable, unitary
theories of elds with spin 0, 1/2 and 1, but their generalization to higher-spin elds, gravity
in particular, is not evident. yet, it is a bit uncomfortable that elds of spin 0, 1/2 and 1 have
such a dierent status from elds of higher spin and a unied description would be desirable.
the two principles underlying the proposed approach are: (i) a conformal hypothesis, say-
ing that every quantum eld theory describing the phenomena of nature should be a renormaliza-
tion-group interpolation between a uv conformal eld theory and an ir conformal eld theory;
and (ii) the irreversibility principle, stating that all fundamental theories of nature should be
quantum irreversible, i.e. satisfy auv  air.

we can distinguish between a strong form of the conformal hypothesis, when the classi-
cal action is conformal-invariant and all dimensionful parameters descend from the rg scale
, and a weak form of this hypothesis, when newtons constant and, eventually, other non-
renormalizable parameters, descend from , like qcd, but the classical action is allowed to

4

contain super-renormalizable terms and masses and be conformal only in their absence. massless
qcd obeys the strong form of the conformal hypothesis (the masses of hadrons are propor-
tional to qcd and therefore descend from ), while massive qcd obeys the weak form of the
conformal hypothesis (the pion masses and corrections to hadron masses are generated by the
quark masses, i.e. they do not descend from ).

theories obeying the strong conformal hypothesis fall under the treatment of refs.

[3, 4]
and admit a general formula expressing the dierence auv  air [3] as the invariant area of the
graph of the beta function. theories obeying the weak conformal hypothesis also satisfy the
1, but the actual value of auv  air is not measured by the same formula
inequality auv  air
[5]. these two cases can be assimilated to each other at the quantitative level when c = a [5].
it is not clear at present how to link these two forms of irreversibility in the general case c 6= a,
but presumably there is no need to either, since the eects of masses can usually be included
straightforwardly [11]. observe that the irreversibility property implies that a perturbative
formulation of quantum eld theory is meaningful only from the uv. since degrees of freedom
are lost from the uv to the ir, a quantum eld theory formulated from the ir (such as in
ir-free theories) should be plagued by inconsistencies or be trivial2.

if the ultimate theory of the world falls into one of the two classes mentioned here, then the
theories not obeying the (strong or weak) conformal hypothesis should be viewed as low-energy
eective theories descending from high-energy fundamental theories that obey the conformal
hypothesis. in particular, any non-renormalizable interaction, and gravity in particular, should
be a low-energy eect. observe that, if it were not so, non-renormalizable terms, admitting that
we can make sense out of them without additional elds in the theory, are expected to violate
the irreversibility principle. for example, a term 6/m2 forces the eld  to vanish identically
in the uv limit m  0 and leaves the ir unchanged. in certain supersymmetric theories [11]
where some treatment of non-renormalizable terms has been claimed to be meaningful in the
context of the so-called electricmagnetic duality, it has been found that non-renormalizable
terms do violate the irreversibility statement (see section 6 of [11]).

finally, a special place is occupied by the c = a ows, i.e. ows that connect uv and
ir xed points in such a way that the dierence c  a remains constant (not necessarily zero),
or at least auv  air = cuv  cir. the xed points might or not have c = a. for example,
taking a direct product between a c = a ow connecting two c = a xed points and a free-eld
theory, we can obtain a c = a ow connecting c 6= a xed points. these ows also fall under
the treatment of [5]. in such cases dimensionless parameters can be assimilated to dimensionful
coupling constants, for example masses and, conceivably, also the newton constant, even if they
are not induced by . the weak point of these theories is that they are phenomenologically
disfavoured. a necessary condition fot a c = a ow is obtained by comparing the values of c

1 a mass term 1

2 m22 or, in general, super-renormalizable terms, has the eect of killing degrees of freedom
in the ir, while the uv is left unchanged [19]. roughly, this happens because the limit m   is compatible
only with   0.

2 for example, the landau poles in qed, the non-perturbative triviality of the 4-theory, the perturbative
non-renormalizability of quantum gravity. there is a good amount of evidence that qcd, instead, is fully
consistent.

and a at energies admitting (approximate) free-eld descriptions. using the free-eld values
c = (ns + 6nf + 12nv)/120 and a = (ns + 11nf + 62nv)/360, ns,f,v being the numbers of
real scalars, dirac fermions and vectors, respectively, the dierences between the numbers of
spin-0, 1/2, 1 elds at two such energies are related in this case by the formula

2ns + 7nf = 26nv.

(1.2)

comparing the uv and ir limits of massless qcd, we nd ns = n2
f + 1, nf = ncnf ,
nv = n 2
c  1, where nc is the number of colours and nf is the number of quark avours. it is
easy to check that the condition has no solution. similarly, the spectra of the known low-energy
physics do not appear to obey (1.2). for example, in the ir we can neglect the electron, but
we have to include it at energies comparable with its mass. formula (1.2) implies that as soon
as the electron, or other fermions, becomes important, also vector elds should appear. there
is no evidence of such a behaviour in nature. finally, neither the standard model nor qcd
have c = a3.

we have analysed various phenomena of ordinary theories that might suggest valid guidelines
for possible generalizations to new theories and gravity. these are, in summary, the reasons why
i think that it is interesting to investigate higher-derivative theories and higher-spin conformal
eld theories starting from the properties of c and a. we are now ready for the more technical
part. we rst study higher-derivative theories and then higher-spin conformal theories.

2 higher-derivative conformal eld theories

i begin by studying c and a in higher-derivative conformal eld theories. the free higher-
derivative scalar eld is interesting because it corresponds to the induced action for the confor-
mal factor  in an ordinary renormalizable theory and is described by the lagrangian

s =

g4(cid:21) ,

q

where 4 = 2 +2r 2
r is the pondered
euler density [4]. here q is a background charge. it does aect the induced eective action
for the gravitational eld, but its contribution is not of anomalous origin (see below). i keep q
non-zero to show that it cannot be used to make either c or a positive.

the theory (2.3) has been studied in refs. [21, 22] and is the four-dimensional analogue of
the free two-dimensional scalar eld. non-unitarity is evident from the fact that c and a are
negative:

(2.3)

(2.4)

c =

a =

90  q2.

3we can check it in the free-eld limits. qed has nv = 1, nf = 1 and c  a = 37/360. massless qcd
has nv = 8, nf = 18 and c  a = 41/180. the electroweak theory has nv = 4, nf = 9/2, ns = 4 and
c  a = 43/180. the standard model has c  a = 293/720. we see that c  a is always negative, which means
that there are many vector elds.

6

the values at q = 0 can be read from [20, 21] and are the contributions coming from the
determinant of 4. the contribution of the background charge is found after a translation in
the functional integral and the integration over :

the term proportional to q2 aects the quantity a by the shift written in (2.4). this can be
seen using for example the formulas of [20].

no real value of q can give a positive a, as promised. moreover, the background charge has
no eect on c. the negative value of c can be checked by computing the stress-tensor two-point
function and does not depend on q. the stress tensor reads

the two-point function is

in agreement with the value of c given above. we see that the non-unitarity of the theory is
exhibited by a violation of reection positivity. similarly, the non-unitarity of non-conformal
higher-derivative theories, such as a scalar eld with lagrangian l = 1
(+m2), is exhibited
by poles with negative residues in the propagator [23].

this theory can be coupled to, say, the electromagnetic eld.
in a at gravitational back-
ground the most general renormalizable lagrangian has a nite number of parameters due to
the statistics of  :

l =

 + |dd|2 + if dd + |dd|2 +  ,
f 2

where d2 = dd. each term can be further multiplied by a polynomial 1 + h. some
simplication comes from the invariance of the theory under the renormalizable change of
variables

a  a + i ,

 being a parameter of no physical interest.

7

the change of the statistics of the elds does not eliminate the non-unitarity of the theory.
indeed, the low-dimensionality of ,  allows us to construct many operators violating the
ferraragattogrillo theorem. there are also operators satisfying reection positivity before
the change of statistics and violating it afterwards. for example

h( )(x) ( )(0)i = (h(x) (0)i)2 < 0.

finally, there are also operators that have a vanishing two-point function, such as two terms of
the electromagnetic current:

despite the unitarity problem, renormalization of this theory is well-behaved and very pre-
sumably there is a conformal window, at least when the gauge eld is non-abelian. theories
such as these are a useful laboratory for the approach of [1].

the factor could be xed unambiguously with the ope technique of sect. 4 or the noether
method, but here we do not need it, since our primary concern is to show that c is negative,

summarizing, higher-derivative theories with ordinary statistics have negative central char-
ges, which means that the ghost degrees of freedom prevail over the physical ones. yet, these
theories can be conformal at the classical level and renormalizable at the quantum level. while
the unitarity violations can hardly be removed completely, it might be possible that in some
conformal theories certain problems are less serious, so that c and a be positive, despite of the
underlying non-unitarity. higher-spin conformal eld theories, which i analyse in the rest of
the paper, appear to have this property.

3 conformal bosonic elds

the simplest example of higher-spin conformal eld theory is the free spin-2 conformal eld.

let  be symmetric and traceless. the action

tensor  transforms as

|x|2 . under this transformation the

where i(x) = 2xx /|x|2. this invariance xes uniquely the action s, and the lagrangian
l1 up to total derivatives. a better choice of the total derivatives leads to the lagrangian

l =

(3.7)

l transforms as a scalar under coordinate inversion, l |x|8l. the action s is invariant under
the higher-derivative gauge transformation

 =

 ,

(3.8)

but not with respect to the dieomorphism-type transformation  =  +  . the
lagrangian l is also invariant, while l1 is invariant up to a total derivative.

9

the gauge transformation (3.8) is compatible with the conformal symmetry. this can be
proved by observing that  has dimension 1 and thus, under coordinate inversion, 
transforms in the same way as :

  |x|2,

 

1
4

   |x|2i(x)i(x)(cid:18)

 (cid:19) .

to check this, observe that the derivative operator transforms as a vector of dimension 1:
  |x|2i (x) .

the eld equations read

dening the vector eld a =  and its eld strength f = a  a, the eld
equations and gauge invariance imply

f = 0,

3.1 field strength

the gauge symmetry (3.8) leads to the introduction of a natural eld strength,

f =    

1
3

 +

1
3

,

which is easily proved to be gauge-invariant. this eld strength satises a number of noticeable
properties. first of all, we have the identities

f = f,

f = 0,

f + f + f = 0.

(3.9)

the third identity will be called the cyclic identity. secondly, the lagrangian (3.7) can be
written as

l =

1
4

(f)2,

which implies, in particular, that it is positive-denite, a fact that was not evident from (3.6)
and (3.7). since l is a conformal eld of dimension 4, it is evident that the eld strength is
itself a conformal eld of dimension 2 and transforms as

under coordinate inversion. the eld equations read

f  |x|4i(x)i(x)i(x)f

f + f = 0.

(3.10)

it is convenient to introduce the dual of the eld strength, as well as self-dual and anti-self-

dual eld strengths:

f =

1
2

f,

f 

 =

1

2(cid:16)f  f(cid:17) .

10

each of these tensors satises the same symmetry identities (3.9) as f. we can also derive
the bianchi identity

 f +  f = 0.

there is a natural topological invariant and a chernsimons form:

f f =  (f) .

non-trivial interactions for conformal higher-spin theories can be constructed, as power

series in the eld strength:

 being some mass scale and a, b, c being dimensionless parameters. these vertices are non-
trivial because they do not vanish when the eld equations (3.10) are satised. our interest,
however, is mostly to look for non-trivial renormalizable interactions, which preserve confor-
mality at the classical level. these are more dicult to construct, but are fundamental for the
conformal hypothesis stated in the introduction. certain renormalizable interactions will be
studied in this paper (for fermionic higher-spin conformal theories), but a complete classication
will not be given here.

the coupling to gravity is not straightforward and might not exist at all. simple attempts
to impose the compatibility between the gauge symmetry (3.8) and gravity generate terms that
cannot be reabsorbed. nevertheless, this does not forbid a correct denition of c and a (see
section 3).

3.2 propagator and ghosts

in this section i calculate the propagators and discuss a number of important features. the
quantization is performed in the brs approach and in the framework of the functional integral.

the most natural gauge-xing is

the ghosts of the theory are the components a and a way to single out the (two) physical

degrees of freedom is to set

a =  = 0.

(3.13)

this condition has no dynamical origin (the theory has a 6= 0) and is here meant for a
pedagogical purpose. observe that only when a = 0 the eld equations reduce to an ordinary
wave equation for  ,  = 0. moreover, the propagator, saturated with -polarizations,
becomes |(k)|2/k2 in this case. the gauge-xing condition   = 0 gives, in momentum
space,

00 + ninjij = 2ni0i,

(3.14)

where ni = ki/k0, i = 1, 2, 3, and k2
give

0 = k2

i . when a = 0, the additional conditions i = 0

which, reinserted into (3.14), also give

njij = 0i,

00 = ni0i,

i.e. 0 = 0, justifying (3.13). the condition of vanishing trace for  gives ii = 00 =
ninjij. we have therefore

||2 = |ij|2 + |ii|2  2|njij|2.

12

let us choose ni = (0, 0, 1). the condition ii = ninjij gives 22 = 11 and nally

||2 = 2(|11|2 + |12|2)  0.

concluding, the two physical degrees of freedom are 11 and 12, the unphysical degrees of
freedom are a. the question is which of the two prevail in c and a. if the central charges are
positive, the physical degrees of freedom prevail over the unphysical ones. we compute c and
a in section 4.

s = 1 and to the free real-scalar theory for s = 0. the action is invariant under the gauge
transformation

1s = 1  s   traces,

which, as before, is compatible with (3.15), when taking into account that  has dimension
1  s and transforms as   |x|2(1s) under coordinate inversion.

a hat denotes indices that have to be omitted. as before, the eld strength is gauge-invariant
and conformal. it is completely symmetric in 2  s and antisymmetric in . furthermore, it
is completely traceless, not only in the indices 2  s, but also with respect to the remaining
contraction:

finally, it satises the cyclic condition

f3s = 0.

f3s + f3s + f3s = 0.

and satisfy the traceless and cyclic conditions (3.16) and (3.17).

there is a topological invariant, proportional to the integral of

f2s

f2s =  (2sf2s) .

the equality can be proved by using the bianchi identity and (3.16).

the stress tensor (see the discussion of sect. 4.1) is

tracelessness is straightforward, while the proof of conservation follows the same line as in the
spin-2 case. the procedure to x the overall factor and the comparison with the noether tensor
are discussed in detail for s = 2. higher-spin tensor currents can be constructed using the
recipes of [26, 27].

3.4 implications of the higher-derivative gauge invariance on correlators

the general form of the two-point function of a conformal composite operator o1s with spin
s is, in the notation of [26, 27]:

ho1s(x) o1s(0)i = cs

to any index. for example,  =     for s = 1, whileq(2)

is the unique dierential operator of degree 2s that is completely symmetric
and traceless in 1  s and 1  s, symmetric in the exchange   , conserved with respect
2 ( + ) 
3  . the factor cs is a constant (higher-spin central charge) and hs is equal to s  s  2,
where s is the total dimension of the operator o1s.

, = 1

1

if the operator o1s couples to a conformal higher-spin eld 1s, via a vertex o1s1s,

then the following multiple-conservation condition holds:

1  so1s = 0.

(3.19)

an ordinary conservation condition so1s = 0 implies hs = 0.
instead, applying the
multiple-conservation condition (3.19) to the correlator (3.18), we nd that hs can take an
arbitrary integer value between 0 and 1  s. consequently, we have the following spectrum of
allowed dimensions:

s = 2 + s, 1 + s, , 3.

14

(3.20)

observe that only the operators of dimension 3 need s divergences to be annihilated. operators
of higher dimension are allowed to satisfy more restrictive conditions. in particular, operators
of dimension 2 + s can be conserved in the usual sense (1o1s = 0), operators of dimension
1 + s can be annihilated by two divergences (1 2o1s = 0), etc.

the ferraragattogrillo theorem [9] says that in a unitary theory primary conformal
operators with spin-s have dimensions s  2 + s. this property is here violated. we see
from (3.20) that the minimal allowed dimension is 3. this feature is relevant to the conformal
hypothesis stated in the introduction: the interaction vertex

is renormalizable if o1s is such an operator of dimension 3; therefore, in our theories,
renormalizable higher-spin interactions are not ruled out in a trivial way (see section 5.1).

4 the spin-2 conformal boson in detail

in this section i study the stress tensor of the spin-2 conformal boson, compute its two-point
function and ope, and extract the values of the central charges c and a. the result is that
both c and a have positive values.

4.1 stress-tensor, spin-2 currents and the denitions of c and a

the noether method produces a non-gauge-invariant, non-symmetric, traceful stress tensor

t n
 = f 

1
4

 f 2

.

this operator is conserved in  ( t = 0), gauge-invariant and traceless up to total derivatives,
and it does not transform simply under coordinate inversion x  x/|x|2. for this reason,
it is not easy to use the noether tensor to extract c and a. moreover, no improvement term
 =  appears to be such that t n
 + transform correctly and be gauge-invariant.

there exists, nevertheless, a remarkable spin-2 tensor:

t =

,

(4.21)

which appears to have the desired properties. we are going to show that this tensor gives
sensible denitions of c and a and compute their values.

the unusual factor will be xed in the next section by checking the poincare algebra in the

operator-product expansion.

it is straightforward to show that t is traceless, gauge-invariant and conserved when the
eld equations (3.10) are satised, and transforms correctly under coordinate inversion. for
the proof of conservation we observe that the cyclic identity also implies

t =

 f 
f +

.

15

the dierence  between the two forms for t is proportional to f +
[], the brackets
denoting antisymmetrization. the cyclic identity in (3.9) can be expressed as f  f =
f. similar expressions hold for f and f . we have therefore   f +
 . using the
cyclic identity once more on f + we arrive at   f +

we are going, with some abuse of language, to call stress tensor the spin-2 current (4.21),
because this helps us use formulas from the literature. it is clear, on the other hand, that it is a
fairly new object and demands a special study. at the moment, however, i cannot characterize
it any better, and the properties outlined here are meant to draw attention to it.

4.2 computation of c
the eld-strength propagator hf(x) f (0)i is, by conformal invariance, 1/|x|2d times a
linear combination of the following three conformal structures:

c (1)
, (x) = (i(x)i(x)  i(x)i(x))i(x),
c (2)
, = (ii  ii)i  (  ),
c (3)
, = (i  i)  (  ),

where d is the dimension of f (2 in the free-eld limit). the trace and cyclic conditions (3.9) x
the combination of c (1), c (2) and c (3) uniquely up to the overall factor, which can be found by
direct inspection, using the -propagator worked out in the previous section. the nal result
reads

hf(x) f (0)i =

|x|4(cid:16)2 c (1)

,  c (2)

,(cid:17) .

(4.22)

a good check is that this correlator satises the eld equations (3.10).

with (4.22) we nd the two-point function:

ht (x) t(0)i =

454y(2)

|x|4(cid:19) ,
,(cid:18) 1

and this denes the central charge c. we have

c =

.

4.3 ope structure and computation of a

the ope structure exhibits novel features with respect to the ordinary theories. in particular,
the presence of ghosts is exhibited by higher-spin composite operators of low dimensionality.
the ope of two stress tensors contains: the central charge c, with singularity 1/|x|8; the stress
tensor itself, with singularity 1/|x|4; higher-spin currents of dimension 2 + s, 1 + s, 3, where s
is the spin; descendants and regular terms. the rst higher-spin current is a spin-4, dimension-4
operator appearing at the same level as the stress tensor (singularity 1/|x|4). this operator

16

reads

 f 

  traces.

o(4)
 satises the multiple-conservation condition o(4)

the primed sum is understood to be divided by the number of permutations. the operator
 = 0. the proof of this fact
is lengthy and involves repeated use of the cyclic identity and the eld equations. observe in
particular that f = 0 on the solutions to the eld equations. i illustrate the strategy
of the proof on the most involved term, which is

f +

 f 

.

first, we exchange  and  by using the property of self-duality in  and anti-self-duality in
. we then use the cyclic identity on f 
f +

 and arrive at
  (f 

 + f 

).

we use the eld equations to replace f 
identical to the one we started from. we move it on the left-hand side and write

 with f 

 and observe that we obtain a term

f +

 f 

 =

1

  f

now we use the cyclic identity on f +

 and get

using the eld equation f +

 we nally arrive at

 f 

 = 0.

the other non-trace terms in o(4)

 can be shown to vanish in a similar way. finally,
the trace terms always contain the stress tensor and obey the multiple-conservation condition
because the stress tensor is conserved.

the expression on the left-hand side contains also o(4)

stress tensor and so does not contribute to c and a.

we can dene our a in the following way. the scalar, spinor and vector ope terms (t t )t
are a basis for the ope structure [26]. we use the stress-tensor two-point function and the
t t ope to associate eective numbers ns,f,v of scalars, fermions and vectors to the spin-2
conformal eld and then apply the free-elds formulas for c and a.

we write

h(t t ) ti = nsh(t t ) tis + nfh(t t ) tif + nvh(t t ) tiv.

here (t t ) means that we take the limit in which the distance between the rst two t -insertions
tends to zero, and so we can use the ope calculated above. on the right-hand side, h(t t ) tis,f,v
denote the corresponding expressions for one free real scalar, one fermion and one vector, which
can be read in [26]. clearly, only the t -content of the ope is relevant in the limit we are
considering: h(t t ) ti = (t t )tht ti, where (t t )t denotes the structure multiplying t in the
t t ope. for example, (t t )t is the structure contained between the rst square brackets in
(4.23). we have

c (t t )t =

s + 6 nf (t t )t

f + 12 nv(t t )t

(4.24)

1

120(cid:2)ns(t t )t

v(cid:3) .

using the two-point functions and opes of free elds [26] we arrive, by comparison, at

ns = 0,

nf =

256
27

,

nv =

64
27

.

observe that ns = 0 can be inferred immediately from the ope. scalar elds produce a structure
s with the maximal number of uncontracted xs (six), vector elds give a structure (t t )t
(t t )t
v
with the minimum number (two) and (t t )t
f , for the spinors, contain four uncontracted xs. a
quick inspection of the propagator shows that our structure (t t )t cannot contain more than
four uncontracted xs.

c =

45

,

a =

848
1215

,

c  a

c

=

54

.

we see that both c and a are positive, as well as nf and nv, and that c is almost equal to a,
but slightly greater.

the procedure used to calculate c and a (4.24) guarantees that these values parametrize the
trace anomaly in the appropriate way. however, we cannot write for the trace anomaly a closed
expression such as (1.1), which makes use of the coupling to external gravity, and we need to
work always at the level of correlators and opes. it is meaningful, nevertheless, to truncate
the right-hand side of (1.1) to the quadratic terms in an expansion of the gravitational eld
around at space.

we have therefore shown that c and a can be appropriately dened in our theories despite
the absence of a coupling to external gravity, and that they are positive. some issues need to
be better understood, for example the relation (if any) between the gauge-invariant tensor t
and the noether tensor.

the presence of this multiply-conserved, spin-4, dimension-4 operator, absent in ordinary the-
ories, is here emphasized, as a good illustration of the new features of higher-spin conformal
eld theory and the role of the multiple-conservation condition. the hope is that the ghost
degrees of freedom, or spin-s operators with dimension lower than 2 + s, might be controlled in
some way. a suciently strong interaction might raise the dimensions of all operators. i recall
that the nachtmann theorem [8], in unitary theories, states that the anomalous dimensions
of the higher-spin currents generated by the singular terms of the ope are to some extent
correlated [24, 25] (e.g. the anomalous dimensions increase with the spin and the magnitude of
the interaction). it is conceivable that a similar result here would ensure that below a certain
energy threshold, when the interaction is suciently strong, the theory is perfectly unitary, i.e.
all spin-s operators have dimension greater than or equal to 2 + s.

4.4 antisymmetric conformal tensors

with antisymmetric tensors, many of the nice features of symmetric tensors disappear.
in
particular, conformal invariance spoils both the positivity of the action and gauge invariance.
a 2-form a has the conformal-invariant action

s =

1

2z (cid:2)(a )2  4(a )2(cid:3) .

with a =    we nd s =  1
and gauge invariance is completely lost. the theory can be coupled in a (classically) conformal
way to abelian and non-abelian gauge elds, as well as gravity. renormalizable couplings to

2r (a )2, so that the action is not positive-denite

19

symmetric higher-spin conformal elds is instead problematic. for example, a coupling of a
complex antisymmetric tensor with a spin-3 eld of the pauli type, such as

igf a a = o(3)

 + total derivatives

vanishes because of the cyclic identity.

the a -eld equations and propagator read

a2(a +a) = 0,
observe that the propagator is reection-negative. we conclude that antisymmetric conformal
tensor elds are much less interesting than the symmetric tensors.

5 conformal fermionic elds

a spin-(s + 1/2) eld is described by a spinor 1s with s lorentz indices, completely sym-

the transformation of the spinor under coordinate inversion is

the contraction 2s transforms as a spin-(s  1/2) conformal spinor. further contrac-
tions with gamma matrices are automatically zero, owing to complete tracelessness. instead
i=1 i1is transforms as a spin-(s + 1/2) spinor. therefore we can always impose

and preserve conformal invariance. under this condition the most general conformal lagrangian
is simply

condition (5.25) is not sucient to eliminate the ghosts of the theory. we see that no
gauge invariance survives and the theory can be straightforwardly coupled to abelian and non-
abelian gauge elds, as well as gravity. in particular, c and a can be dened in the usual way.
in the next section, i discuss the case s = 1 in detail and compute the contribution of conformal
spinors to the gauge beta function.

our theory coincides with the theory called singular by haberzett in the context of the
nuclear theory of hadronic resonances: see formula (40) of ref. [17]. its conformal invariance,
and the unicity of the theory in this respect, is here emphasized.

the theory is conformal at the classical level, and scale invariance is broken, as usual, by
the radiative corrections at the quantum level. i have computed the one-loop beta function of
this model in two dierent ways (gluon self-energy and three-gluon vertex), with the result

(g) = 

g3

482(cid:2)11c(g)  20c(r3/2)  4c(r1/2)(cid:3) .

the correction due to our spin-3/2 eld is the term proportional to c(r3/2), while the term
proportional to c(r1/2) is the usual spin-1/2 contribution, here inserted for comparison.

we see that this peculiar type of matter contributes to the beta function with the same
sign as ordinary matter. for c(r3/2) . 11
20 c(g) the one-loop beta function is arbitrarily small
with respect to the higher-order corrections, which allow us to conclude that there is a non-
trivial ir xed point, trustable in perturbation theory, and a conformal window, which is the
main reason why these theories are an interesting laboratory of models for the ideas of [1].
similar arguments extend to arbitrary half-integer spin. note that our theories, in spite of
their non-unitarity, are renormalizable and are not higher-derivative. for this reason we do
not compare our results, for example, with the supergravity calculations, which cannot give
evidence of a conformal window.

6 conclusions

we have explored higher-derivative theories and higher-spin conformal theories, and studied
the central charges c and a, their positivity properties, the existence of renormalizable cou-
plings and conformal windows. these theories are good toy models for investigations in the
spirit of [1, 5], the study of questions concerning quantum irreversibility and the search for
a unied description of higher- and lower-spin elds. antisymmetric conformal tensors and
higher-derivative theories exhibit severe violations of positive-deniteness and reection posi-
tivity. instead, there is evidence that higher-spin conformal symmetric tensors and fermions
have positive c and a. the symmetric tensors, moreover, have a positive-denite action and
a peculiar gauge symmetry. these properties, i believe, make higher-spin conformal theories
worthy of attention, even if they are not unitary.
