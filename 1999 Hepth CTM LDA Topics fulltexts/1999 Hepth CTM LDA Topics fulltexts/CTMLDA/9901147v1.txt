abstract

de sitter spacetime is known to have a cosmological horizon that enjoys

thermodynamic-like properties similar to those of a black hole horizon.

in

this note we show that a universal argument can be given for the entropy

of de sitter spacetime in arbitrary dimensions, by generalizing a recent near

horizon symmetry plus conformal eld theory argument of carlip for black

hole entropy. the implications of this argument are also discussed.

i. introduction

in general relativity, gravitational collapse of massive stars and the expansion of the

universe are two sides of the same coin. both are manifestation of the instability of gravita-

tion. the singularity theorem of hawking and penrose [1] applies to both. in its nal stage,

gravitational collapse always leads to formation of an event horizon, the black hole horizon,

which is the boundary of a spacetime region which is not visible to an external observer. in

cosmology the counterpart of the black hole horizon is the cosmological event horizon1 in a

de sitter universe.

the de sitter metric in d dimensions is given by

ds2 = (1 

r2
2 )dt2 + (1 

r2
2 )dr2 + r2d2,

(1.1)

where d2 is the solid-angle element on (d 2)-dimensional sphere, and the range 0  r  
covers a portion of de sitter space with the boundary at r = . with d = 4, it was rst

discovered [2] as a vacuum solution to the einstein equations with a replusive cosmological
constant  = (d  1)(d  2)/22. on one hand, cosmological models with a repulsive
cosmological constant which expands forever approach asymptotically de sitter space at

large times. on the other hand, the exponential expansion of our universe in the early

inationary period was driven by the vacuum energy of a scalar eld, eectively acting as a

positive cosmological constant, and thus can be described by the de sitter metric.

it is well-known that a de sitter universe expands so rapidly that for the geodesic observer

at the origin, there is an cosmological horizon located at r = , from beyond which light can

never reach him/her. the area of this horizon may be regarded as a measure of his/her lack

of knowledge about the rest of the universe beyond his/her ken. thus, one expects that a

cosmological horizon should have many similarities with a black hole horizon. indeed in late

seventies gibbons and hawking [3] have shown that in general relativity, both the black-hole

1hereafter we will use simply the term horizon in lieu of event horizon.

2

and the cosmological horizons share the same set of laws which are formally analogous to

those of thermodynamics: in either case, the surface gravity at the horizon is proportional

to the eective temperature, and the area a of the horizon is to the entropy s, as given by

the bekenstein-hawking formula:

s =

a
4g

.

(1.2)

furthermore, they showed that if the quantum eects of pair creation in curved spacetime

are included, this similarity between the laws of horizons and thermodynamics is more than

an analogy: an observer will detect a background of thermal radiation coming apparently

from the cosmological horizon, in a manner similar to the hawking radiation from a black

hole horizon. thus the close connection between horizons and thermodynamics has a wider

validity than the ordinary black hole cases in which it was rst discovered [3].

this lesson becomes particularly important in the wake of the recent progress in string

theory in understanding the microscopic states that are responsible for the black hole en-

tropy [4,5]. one is naturally led to search for a fundamental, microscopic mechanism for

gravitaional entropy that is universally applicable to de sitter entropy in arbitrary dimen-

sions as well as to black hole entropy. the method of counting d-brane states for black

hole entropy does not seem to satisfy this universality requirement, since at present we do

not know yet what are the d-brane states responsible for a cosmological horizon. recently

maldacena and strominger [6] has attacked the problem of de sitter entropy in the partic-

ular case of 2 + 1 dimensions. they explored the equivalence between chern-simons gauge

theory and 2 + 1 de sitter gravity, and showed that the asymptotic symmetry group of the

theory near the cosmological horizon contains a virasoro subalgebra, with a central charge

right to reproduce the de sitter entropy via the cardy formula [7,8]

log((h, h)) = 2
s ch


6

+s ch
 ,

which counts the asymptotic density of states of the hilbert space of a conformal eld

theory (cft) labelled by the conformal weight (h, h) and the (eective) central charge c.

3

(1.3)

however, it is hard to see how this argument could be generalized to quantum gravity in

other dimensions, where no equivalent chern-simons theory is available.

recently carlip [9] has put forward a universal argument for black hole entropy in any

dimension, exploring near-horizon symmetry and conformal eld theory. in the present note

we will show that his argument can be generalized to give a universal argument for the de

sitter entropy in arbitrary dimensions. also a recent proposal in ref. [13] for a candidate

cft on black horizon by dimensional reduction of gravity will be shown to be applicable to

the de sitter case. this note not only adds weight to the universality of carlips argument,

but also points to a profound connection between the microscopic origin of the gravitational

entropy associated with any horizon and conformal eld theory. indeed for quite a while

there have been suggestions on the close relationship between the black hole entropy and

conformal eld theory, see e.g. [10] and references therein. our note conrms the existence

of such a relationship for cosmological horizons.

ii. near-horizon virasoro symmetry

let us consider a sector in quantum gravity that, in the semiclassical limit, corresponds

to uctualtions (of both geometry and coordinates) around the standard de sitter metric

(1.1):

ds2 = n 2dt2 + f 2(dr + n rdt)2 + (dx + n dt)(dx + n dt).

(2.1)

here x are coordinates on a (d  2)-dimensional sphere. we have adopted the arnowitt-
deser-misner scheme, xing the horizon to be located at r =  and requiring that near the

horizon the lapse function n behave as

n 2 =

4


(  r) + o(  r)2,

(2.2)

where   2. we will treat the horizon as an outer boundary (i.e. 0  r  ) and require
that the metric approach that of a standard de sitter metric on this boundary. to dene the

theory more precisely, one may impose the following fall-o conditions near the boundary:

4

f = o(n 1), n r = o(n 2),  = o(1), n  = o(n),

(t  n rr)g = o(n)g, n + n = o(n 2).

(2.3)

similar to those in ref. [9], with the only dierence in the equations involving n, which

in our case essentially require that the angular momentum be constantly vanishing on the

horizon. given this asymptotic behavior of the metric, it is easy to check that near the

horizon, the extrinsic curvature of a slice of constant time behaves like

krr = o(n 3), kr = o(n 2), k = o(1).

(2.4)

in the same spirit of the work of brown and henneaux [12] and of carlip [9], we want to

show that the gauge symmetries of this classical theory with boundary contains a virasoro

subalgebra with a central charge. in the hamiltonian formulation of general relativity, the

gauge symmetries are the so-called surface deformations2 that preserve the fall-o conditions

(2.3) near the horizon. the full generator for surface deformations is known to be given by

l[] = h[] + j[],

where the rst term is the bulk term and the second the boundary term [12]:

h[] = z
j[] =

dd1x  h
1
8g zr=r+

dd2xnnaa t + ar

a + na ako .

(2.5)

(2.6)

here {ht,ha} (a = r, ) are the hamiltonian and momentum constraints. the surface
deformation parameters  are related to spacetime dieomorphism parameters  by t =

nt and a = a + n at. to preserve the fall-o conditions (2.3) it is required that near

n = 0,

t = o(n), r = o(n 2), and  = o(1).

(2.7)

2 readers who are unfamiliar with the formulation of the surface deformations can see [11] for

details.

5

they satisfy a lie algebra; the part relevant to our later analysis is

{ m, n}t

sd = a

1 a t

2  a

2 a t
1.

(2.8)

in the full generator (2.5), we need the boundary term j[], whose variation cancels

the unwanted surface term in the variation of the bulk term h[], so that the functional

derivative of l[] is well dened. it is easy to verify that this is indeed true if we restrict

our variations to those satisfying

f /f = o(n), krr/krr = o(n).

(2.9)

following [9], we consider a particular class of surface deformations as follows:

first, for simplicity, we specialize to the cases with 0 = n r = n  = t,(n ) = t,(n 2),
( 6= ), where  is a selected azimuthal angle such that n  is o(n) but not zero. later
we will see that this will help us to distinguish the left and right circular modes of . to

avoid the singular behavior on the horizon for the angular mode-decomposition of t, we

introduce a spherical surface h with distance  to the horizon, and take n  to be constant

on this surface, which tends to zero as we nally take   0 at the end of the calculation.
second we single out a particular class of surface deformations satisfying the dif f (s1)

algebra by the following conditions:

 1. in the conformal coordinates dened by f dr = ndr, the red-shift eect makes the
dieomorphism t to be light-like, and the classical nature of the horizon allows only

the outgoing one into the horizon, that is (t + r)t = 0.

 2. we restrict to the surface deformations which do not change the location of the
horizon dened by the zero of the lapse function n 2. we then impose gtt = 0, where
gtt  1
n 2 . this leads to (t  n )t + [(n 2),r/2n 2]r = 0 on h. then the right
circular modes dened by (t  n )(+) = 0 becomes zero, and the components of
the left circular modes dened by (t + n )(+) = 0 satisfy the relation

() = 2n 2
r
(n 2),r

(t  n )t

() = 4n 2
(n 2),r

tt

() .

(2.10)

 3.

if we assume the parameter t

() to be periodic in time, with period t when

analytically continued to the euclidean signature, then from (1) and (2) it can be

decomposed into the fourier modes

t
()n = anexp{

2in

t

(t  r 


n  )}.

(2.11)

note that the angular decomposition would become singular on the horizon since

n  = 0 there; however, in our treatemnt this is avoided by evaluating everything rst

on h, not directly on the horizon.

 4. from (1), (2) and (3), the surface deformaion lie algebra (2.8) becomes

{ ()m, ()n}t

sd = i(n  m) t

()m+n + 

m t

()n  

n t

()m ,

(2.12)

if an = t /4. clearly, (2.12) reduces to dif f (s1) only if we impose  = 0, which

implies that we restrict the surface deformations to the r  t plane. we emphasize
(2.12) is exact without using any fall-o condition, so it is valid away from the horizon.

to show that the above class of surface deformations generate a virasoro algebra, and to

calculate its central charge, we invoke the well-known fact [12,9] that the poisson brackects
of generic surface deformations close to the lie algebra of surface deformations, { 1, 2}sd,
with a possible central term k[1, 2]:

nl[m], l[n]o = l[{ m, n}sd] + k[m, n] = i(n  m)l[m+n] + k[m, n] .

(2.13)

in ref. [9], it has been shown that the right-hand side of (2.13) is given by the boundary

variation of (2.5), (2.6), which in our case yields

(2.14)

to have a well-dened angular decomposition, this integral is dened on the hypersurface

h. the result turns out to be independent of , so it is safe to take the limit   0 in the

7

nal result. also, there is an overall sign dierence from [9] because of the reversed direction

of the outward unit normal as compared to that of the black hole horizon.

now let us substitute the modes (2.11) into (2.14) and evaluate it on shell at the de

sitter metric on h, then (2.13) becomes

nl[()m], l[()n]o|h[ ]=0 = i

a

t

n3m+n,0 = i (n  m)j[()m+n] + k[()m, ()n],

where a is the area of the cosmological horizon. from (2.6) one obtains

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

if we dene lm = l[()m], then eq. (2.13) gives us a virasoro algebra with central charge3

c =

2g


t

.

(2.18)

we view the above classical symmetry as resulting from that of the quantum theory of

gravity. thus, we infer that the latter should respect a (chiral copy of) virasoro algebra with

the central charge (2.18), and the quantum states characterizing the cosmological horizon

must form a representation of this algebra with the conformal weight h = (a/16g)(t /),

read from (2.16). then one applies cardys formula (1.3) to count the asymptotic density

of states, and get the correct entropy (1.2) for the cosmological horizon. 4

3 this formula is true for any value of the period t ; however, a preferred value is t = , with

which the horizon is free of conical singularity.

4to get the standard form of the central term in (2.17), one may sht l0, and therefore h, by

c/24  h; this also causes a shift in c by 24h  c, which makes eq. (1.3) invariant.

iii. cft candidate by dimensional reduction

in the last section we have used symmetry arguments to derive the behavior of any

quantum mechanical theory of cosmological horizon states. but they did not answer the

question of what are the specic degrees of freedom that account for the horizon states.

recently solodukhin [13] has suggested one possible candidate for black hole horizon states

by dimensional reduction.

in this section, we will show that it is possible to adapt his

procedure to the case of a cosmological horizon, yielding a conformal eld theory (cft)

with the same central charge we have just derived.

let us start with the einstein-hilbert action with a positive cosmoloical constant :

s(d) = 

1

16gd zm d

ddx qg(d) (r(d)  2) .

(3.1)

where gd is the newton constant in d-dimensional space-time. we assume spherical sym-

metry so that the metric is of the following form (a, b = 0, 1)

ds2 = ab dxadxb + r2(x0, x1)d2 ,

(3.2)

where ab is the metric of the destined 2-dimensional manifold and r2 represents the degrees

of freedom for spherical symmetric uctuations of the (d2)-dimensional spheres. moreover,
the 2-dimensional part of the metric will have the following near horizon behavior as in the

de sitter background,

ds2

(2) = n 2 dt2 +

dr2
n 2 ,

(3.3)

where n 2 is the asymptotic lapse function (2.2).

after dimension reduction with the metric in the form of (3.2), the action is reduced to

an eective 2-dimensional theory

s(2) = zm 2

d2x  {

2

()2 +

1
8

(

d  2
d  3

)2(r(2)  2 + (

c
2 )( 2

d2 )(d2))} .

(3.4)

here (d2) = (d  2)(d  3) is the scalar curvature of the (d  2)-dimensional unit sphere,
and

9

2 = crd2 ,

c =

d2
2gd

(

d  3

) ,

where d2 is the area of the unit sphere sd2.

apply the following substitution

ab  (

q ab ,

2  4(

d  3

(3.5)

(3.6)

where h is the value of  at the horizon r = . then (3.4) is transformed into the familiar

liouville-type form

sl = zm 2

d2x  {

2

()2 +

d4

d2  q)}(

d2 ) e

1

q  .

(3.7)

(3.8)

note that ud(h) is nite. our ud only diers from [13] by the term involved , which is

irrevelant in deriving the virasoro algebra below.

the trace of the stress tensor derived from (3.7) by varying ab is

t  abtab = 1

2

q + ud()

(3.9)

it is obvious that the theory is not conformal because of the nonzero t . however, near

the horizon, the red-shift eect will suppress the self interactions ud(h), and the theory

will become conformal in the following coordinates:

z = z

dr

n 2(r)

= 
4

ln(  r) .

(3.10)

one remark here is that even after suppressing the scalar potential ud, t will vanish only if

the equation of motion of  in the new coordinate is satised, so the cft is purely classical.

because the incoming motion from the horizon is forbidden in the classical theory, one can

only use the component t++ = ttt + ttz of the stress tensor, not the component t, as the

physical charge generating the conformal transformations. so the resultant cft is chiral.

10

note that this arguments for the chiral nature of cft is dierent from the condition (2)

used in sec. 2.

following [13], the virasoro algebra generated by t++ can be shown to have the central

charge c = 12q2. q can be determined from 2

h = 4( d3

d2)qh, and if we write q = qh ,

then the central charge becomes

c =

3q2a
4gd

,

(3.11)

it agrees with the result in sec. 2, if q2 = 2/t .

iv. discussions

some remarks are in order.

1) we have shown that the close relationship between gravitational entropy associated

with event horizon and conformal eld theory that was found for black holes actually has a

wider validity, i.e. it holds also for cosmological de sitter-like horizon.

2) the central charge calculated above for the de sitter horizon, either in sec. 2 or in

sec. 3, is classical in nature. namely it is the central charge in a virasoro algebra in the

classical theory of gravity.

3) why the classical central charge gives us the correct entropy when we blindly apply

the cardy formula in quantum conformal eld theory is still a mystery not well understood

yet. the applicability of the cardy formula for de sitter entropy actually involves several

key assumptions about the conformal eld theory associated with quantum gravity. these

assumptions are essentially the same as those involved in the conformal eld theory argu-

ments for black hole horizons, as metioned and discussed in the literatures [6,9,8,14]. we

would not like to repeat them here.

4) however, in view of the fact that the value of the classical central charge gives the

correct value for the gravitational entropy when combined with the cardy formula, we

naturally expect that the value of the classical central charge would not get modied in

11

quantum gravity. perhaps this suggests that the correct quantum theory of gravity should

not be a theory that quantizes the classical theory of gravity. rather the latter is a low-

energy eective theory of the former.
