(demystication of some calculations)

recently it has been suggested by s. carlip that black hole entropy can be derived from a
central charge of the virasoro algebra arising as a subalgebra in the surface deformations of general
relativity in any dimension. here it is shown that the argumentation based on the regge-teitelboim
approach is unsatisfactory. the functionals used are really non-dierentiable under required
variations and also the standard poisson brackets for these functionals are exactly zero so being
unable to get any virasoro algebra with a central charge. nevertheless carlips calculations will be
correct if we admit another denition for the poisson bracket. this new poisson bracket diers from
the standard one in surface terms only and allows to work with non-dierentiable functionals.

i. introduction

an important for black hole physics result  the entropy formula  was derived in publication [1]. the similar
conclusions were obtained also in some other papers, see, for example, [2]. the characteristic feature of the method
applied in [1] is that the canonical formalism of general relativity and the algebra of the hypersurface deformations
are used. the virasoro algebra with its central term arises as a result of the evaluation of poisson brackets and taking
into account boundary conditions on the black hole horizon.

in [1] it is declared that the regge-teitelboim approach based on a construction of the so-called dierentiable
generators is used there. however, a detailed examination shows that this approach is really inaplicable to the case
under consideration. the generators of paper [1] actually are not dierentiable concerning variations needed to
derive the virasoro albebra. in fact, the straightforward and explicit calculation of the poisson brackets according
to the standard formula (by exploiting the general derivation of the surface terms made for 3+1space-time still in
1985) gives us a trivial zero result for the surface integral which should represent the main outcome of paper [1].

we will demonstrate below that in fact modied poisson brackets, applicable in the more general case of non-
dierentiable functionals, are used in publication [1] (but without authors knowledge). these new brackets dier
from the standard ones in boundary terms and they have been used for the rst time in paper [5]. later they were
generalized in two dierent ways [6], [7]. the dierence between these two approaches does not manifest itself in the
case under consideration. recently the same brackets were independently used also in publications [8], [9].

therefore we observe that the derivation of the black hole entropy given in paper [1] formally stays valid if one
changes the argumentation. it is necessary to decline the regge-teitelboim ideology here in favor of the more general
approach which exploits the new poisson brackets.

ii. notations and carlips calculation

we shall use the same notations as used in publication [1]. so, the metric of n-dimensional (in further n = 4 case

is preferred) space-time will be guessed looking as follows

ds2 = n 2dt2 + f 2(dr + n rdt)2 +  (dx + n dt)(dx + n dt),

where ,  . . . correspond to coordinates on a sphere r = const, t = const and run over values 1, 2, . . . , n  2. the
function n tends to zero on the horizon of a black hole r = r+ in such a way that

further, the hamiltonian looks like a linear combination of constraints {ht,ha} plus, probably, some surface

integrals

n 2 = h(x)(r  r+) + o(r  r+)2.

(1)

h[ ] = z

dn1x h,

l[ ] = h[ ] +i

. . . ,

(2)

where the parameters of deformations of a constant time hypersurface (lagrange multipliers for constraints) are compo-
nents of the decomposition for an innitesimal space-time dieomorphism  over the basis {(1/n,n a/n ), /xa}:
(3)

a = a + n at.

t = n t,

if one calculate a variation over gab and ab of that part of a hamiltonian containing only constraints (without the
boundary terms), and consider  as not depending of canonical variables, one get

h = z
dn1x h =
dn1x(cid:18) h

(4)

where na is a unit normal to the boundary at t = const, kab is an extrinsic curvature tensor of a constant time

hypersurface, ab = f(k ab  gabk) are momenta conjugate to the spatial metric gab (the sign diers from [1]).

the surface integral is taken over a boundary which should include, on the one hand, the horizon of a black hole, and
on another  the spatial innity. no boundary conditions are applied here. to within notations the formula coincides
with the similar formula from publication by regge and teitelboim [3].

in further the game is entered by boundary conditions on the canonical variables and on the parameters of defor-

mations. they are

1. to set in a phase space a region close to a black hole solution;

2. to provide conservation of this region under evolution assigned to the parameters of deformations.

carlip starts with the following boundary conditions:

f =

h
4

n 1 + o(1),

n r = o(n 2),

 = o(1),

n  = o(1),

(t  n rr)g = o(n )g ,

n + n = o(n ),

rn = o(1/n ),

krr = o(1/n 3),

kr = o(1/n ),

k = o(1),

r = o(n 2),

t = o(n ),

 = o(1).

but a bit later (after eq. (2.12)) the extra restrictions krr = 0 = k are imposed on the exterior curvature tensor
in [1]. as a result the last term in the variation formula (4) becomes exactly zero and so we, in fact, need not add
the term written in square brackets of (5) below. what about a part of the boundary arranged at spatial innity,
by considering parameters  as rapidly decreasing we get rid of the corresponding contribution to the hamiltonian
variation.

despite of the accepted boundary conditions the variation of hamiltonian h[ ] still contains some surface contri-
bution and to get rid of it in publication [1] it is suggested to add to a linear combination of constraints a surface
integral of the following form

j[ ] =

1

8g ir=r+

dn2xnnaa t + aa

r +hna akio.

(5)

let us immidiately state that the term in square brackets is absolutely not required by the regge-teitelboim ideology,
just opposite, it spoils the dierentiability condition (in [1] this is masked by an unjustied restriction krr/krr =
o(n )), so we treat it as erroneous and it will be excluded from now on. then the variation of the improved hamiltonian
l[ ] = h[ ] + j[ ] becomes

l[ ] = bulk terms +

1

8g ir=r+

dn2x nrr t.

(6)

2

afterwards in publication [1] it is stated that, rst, we can calculate a poisson bracket for generators of two various

deformations according to the following formula

nl[ 2], l[ 1]o =  2

l[ 1],

(7)

and second, it is supposed, that this equality remain valid after reduction, that is, after taking constraints as zeros
in strong sense. the last means, that the formula remains valid for surface integrals taken separately:

boundary terms ofnl[ 2], l[ 1]o  boundary terms of  2

h[ 1] +  2

j[ 1].

(8)

as a result of such evaluation the following expression was obtained for the surface contribution to the poisson bracket

nl[ 2], l[ 1]o:

8g ir=r+

(9)

in further it is used to realize the virasoro algebra, which central charge has allowed to connect the number of horizon
states with the well-known expression for the black hole entropy by bekenstein-hawking. below we shall show, that
the argumentation of paper [1] on a derivation of this formula should be reconsidered.

iii. the regge-teitelboim approach

in publication by regge and teitelboim [3], written in 1974, the hamiltonian formalism of a eld theory for the
rst time was applied to a problem, where the surface integrals originating in integration by parts were non-negligible,
just opposite, they have an important physical meaning. namely, after putting on gauges, that is, after reduction,
the role of generators of the asymptotic poincare group (transformations that preserve boundary conditions of the
asymptotically at space - time) is played by the surface integrals. these surface integrals arise as a result of the
poisson brackets evaluation made according to the well-known formula

{f +i

. . . , g +i

. . .}old = z

dn1x(cid:18) f

qa(x)

g

pa(x) 

f

pa(x)

g

qa(x)(cid:19) ,

and any modication of functionals f and g by surface integrals h . . . (or, that is the same, a modication of their

integrands by divergences) leaves this bracket untouched. it is obvious, as the standard bracket is dened with the
help of euler-lagrange derivatives, and they are zero at any divergences. it is a common belief that the essence of
regge-teitelboims method is to x surface terms in functionals in such a way that their variations look like

f = z

dn1x

f

a(x)

a(x),

without any boundary terms.

however, in the regge-teitelboim approach we can start also with the evaluation of surface integrals in poisson

brackets. this possibility was used in our publication [4]. thus taking as initial hamiltonians

h[ ] = z

dn1x h,

(10)

where {ht,ha} are constraints, we obtain (we write below the corresponding formula from publication [4] in the
notations of carlips work (here n = 4)) the following expression for their poisson bracket:

now in the above we can take into account the boundary conditions from paper [1]. then we get, for example,

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

here we suppose  = 0 instead of  = o(1) because this condition is used in section 3 of [1]. in the similar way it
occurs that all other integrands decrease as o(n ), or faster, i.e. they are zero on the black hole horizon. therefore,
the regge-teitelboim approach does not allow to derive expression (9) which is (2.13) of paper [1]. this is absolutely
natural, because conditions for applying this method are just violated  variation f , induced by a hypersurface
deformation, does not full carlips restriction f /f = o(n ) and really has a form

 f = (cid:16)f r(cid:17),r

= o(n 1)  f,

that is, f /f = o(1). due to this reason the surface integral from equation (2.10) of paper [1]

l[ ] = z

dn1x(cid:18) h

is nonzero, that should be qualied in regge-teitelboims terminology as non-dierentiability of functional l[ ] =
h[ ] + j[ ], where

j[ ] =

1

8g ir=r+

d2xnnaa t + aa

ro.

(16)

here we omit term na ak, which is present in [1]. as it was told above we consider the inclusion of this term as
a mistake which is incorrectly justied in [1] by supposing krr/krr = o(n ).

iv. the new poisson brackets

there is a more general hamiltonian approach where all functionals are admissible, including those giving nonzero
boundary contribution to the rst variation.
it was for the rst time shown in publication [5] that the standard
poisson bracket can be generalized by adding to it some divergence terms. as a result, the bracket so generalized
can generate variations with nonzero surface contribution. this is just required in the case under consideration when
the surface is a black hole horizon. let us mention that two dierent extensions of the formula proposed in [5] were
suggested later. they can be important in cases when surface contributions to functional variations contain arbitrary
spatial derivatives for variations of elds and their conjugate momenta (generally speaking, arbitrary non-canonical

4

variables): [6], [7]. an attempt of comparison of these two dierent formulas was done in paper [10], but here all give
one and the same result.

let us explain this in more detail. let eld variables are not necessarily canonical, but their poisson bracket is

ultralocal

{a(x), b(y)} = iab(x, y),
then the standard bracket of two local functionals has the following form

{f, g} = z

dn1x

f

a(x)

iab

g

b(x)

,

(17)

and for a dierentiable functional we have

f = z

dn1x

f

a(x)

a(x).

let now deal with non-dierentiable functional in regge-teitelboims sense, and let its rst variation has the
simplest possible form with a surface term

f = z

dn1x

f

a(x)

a(x) +i

dn2x

f

a(x)

a(x),

here we consider the above expression as a denition of  and . these notatations are directly taken from [5].
then we can formally construct a full variational derivative as follows

f

a(x)

= ()

f

a(x)

+ ()

f

a(x)

,

to include a surface (or boundary) contribution (here () is the dirac delta-function concentrated on the boundary
of the integration region  and () is the heaviside step function equal to 1 inside  and to 0 outside of it). so, we
treat the full variational derivative as follows

zrn1

dn1x

f

a(x)

a(x)  z

dn1x

f

a(x)

a(x) +i

dn2x

f

a(x)

a(x).

it is possible to put these full variational derivatives into the standard formula for the poisson bracket (17) instead of
the usual euler-lagrange derivatives. then we get

where

{f, g}new = {f, g}old +i

dn2x

f
a

ga i

dn2x

g
a

f a+?!,

f a = iab

f
b

= {a, f},

ga = iab

g
b

= {a, g},

and ?! denotes the puzzling term corresponding to the delta-function squared. in publication [5] it was demanded to
kill this term by a boundary condition which guarantees zero coecient before the dangerous expression [()]2:

(cid:18) f

a(x)

iab

g

b(x)(cid:19)

= 0.

further attempts to extend the result of publication [5] were gone in two directions:

1. searching for regular expressions corresponding to terms like ?! [6];

2. postulating that these terms are absent in the nal formula [7].

5

therefore, the contribution to expression (9) (which is (2.13) of paper [1]) arises just due to non-dierentiability

of functional l[ ]

l[ ] = z

(18)

by this way we get the rst surface contribution to the poisson bracket {l[ 1], l[ 2]}new standing in expression (9)

is connected with the fact that the deformation parameters t themselves are dependent on the canonical variables
and so themselves have nonzero poisson brackets with the hamiltonian. when these parameters come as multipliers
before constraints this fact leads simply to changes in the nal constraint multipliers and it is not important for us as
2 a t
we are on the constraint surface. but when they come in the nonzero surface integrals their variations  2
will give a contribution to the poisson bracket.

v. conclusion

we have shown that the validity of results of paper [1] is in fact based on the application of the new formula for
poisson brackets. this is unfortunately not clear from the argumentation given in [1]. formulas (7) (which is (2.11)
of [1]) and (8) are not valid if the poisson bracket is dened by the standard expression. so, we have one more
testimony in favor of the move to transcend the regge-teitelboim approach in studying the role of boundaries in the
hamiltonian dynamics [6], [11], [12].

recently there appeared a new paper by carlip [13] where the diculties discussed here are avoided by using the
covariant canonical formalism. it maybe also of interest to study the role of surface terms in poisson brackets for this
new approach.
