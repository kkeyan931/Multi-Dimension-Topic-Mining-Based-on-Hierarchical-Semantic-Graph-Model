(74) using decomposition (74) one easily show fractional transfor- mation (19) equivalent action. form (74) convenient since rst term invariant action, second term contains s2 simple transformation properties (19) (21). make matrices real obtain parametrizations sp(2n, ir)/u(n). change basis unitary matrix u dened (62) require matrices real obtain coset space o(n, n)/o(n) o(n). since map injective see s, s2 positive def- inite, global coordinate coset space u(n, n)/u(n) u(n). thus 26 coset space connected. group u(n, n) principal bundle u(n, n)/u(n) u(n) u(n) u(n) ber. number disconnected components principal bundle connected base equal number components ber case one. thus u(n, n) connected. using argument one show sp(2n, ir) connected o(n, n) four components. argument similar one used lorentz group one show least four components. thus, mentioned section 7, o(n, n) exactly four components.
