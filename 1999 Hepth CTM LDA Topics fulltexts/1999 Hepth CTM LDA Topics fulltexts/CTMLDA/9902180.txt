therefore, slightly modify arguments (2.12) replacing c(2) square. brst-like symmetry used compute correlation functions p sl(n|n) models using localization technique. discuss issue one next sections. 8 h (q, si(g)) = g = gl(n|n) 0, g = sl(n|n) 0, 0, g = psl(n|n) > 0 > 1 > 2 (2.11) 3. principal chiral eld conformal theory 3.1. background eld method conformal invariance. simple way show conformal invariance p sl(n|n) principal chiral model based background eld method {$9809057$}. method symmetries theory impose strong constraints form renormalized action, useful. nd theory conformal orders perturbation theory. first all, renormalization general non-linear sigma model studied extensively renormalization group ow interpreted ow space metrics target manifold. words shape size manifold changes ow {$9809057$}. topic also studied using background eld method {$9809057$} {$9711200$}. main technical diculty general case necessity expand action terms linear elds, e.g. riemann normal coordinates. case group manifold target space expansion simplies dramatically terms order written explicitly. allow us analyze orders perturbation theory. background eld method parameterize quantum eld g(x) g(x)g0(x) g0(x) classical background eld g(x) describes quantum uctuations. linear eld quantum uctuation dened g(x) = ea(x) inserted convenient normalization later. a(x) element lie algebra transforms tangent vector point g0(x). terms elds (right) current model becomes g1g = g1 j g 0 g0 + g1 0 ja g0 = j 0 + g1 0 ja g0 , (3.1) denoted background current j 0 current corresponding quantum uctuations ja = eaea. action s = s + s + 1 22 z str(cid:0)ja (g0)g1 0 (cid:1) current ja written terms following expansion: eaea = ja xn=1 n n!
