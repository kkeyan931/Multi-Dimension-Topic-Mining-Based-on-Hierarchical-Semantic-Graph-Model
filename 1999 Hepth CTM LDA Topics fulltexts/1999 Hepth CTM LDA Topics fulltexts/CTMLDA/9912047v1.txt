abstract

i study noncommutative version of adhm construction of instantons, which was pro-
posed by nekrasov and schwarz. noncommutative r4 is described as algebra of operators
acting in fock space. in adhm construction of instantons, one looks for zero-modes of
dirac-like operator. the feature peculiar to noncommutative case is that these zero-modes
project out some states in fock space. i clarify the mechanism of these projections when
the gauge group is u(1). i also construct some zero-modes when the gauge group is u(n)
and demonstrate that the projections also occur, and the mechanism is similar to the
u(1) case.

introduction

one of the most important reasons to consider physics on noncommutaive spacetime is
that the behavior of the theory at short distance is expected to become manageable due
to the noncommutativity of the spacetime coordinates. it was shown [1] that noncommu-
tative geometry appear in a denite limit of string theory, bfss matrix theory [2] and
iib matrix theory [3]. in these cases noncommutativity should be relevant to the short
scale physics of d-branes.

among d-brane systems, dp-brane-d(p+4)-brane bound states are of interest because
this system has two dierent descriptions: in terms of worldvolume theory of dp-branes
and in terms of worldvolume theory of d(p + 4)-branes. d-at condition of the world-
volume theory of dp-brane coincides with adhm equations [4][5], and dp-branes are
described as instantons in d(p + 4)-brane worldvolume theory. these descriptions should
be equivalent because both describe the same system, and indeed the moduli space of
the worldvolume theory of dp-branes is identical to the instanton moduli space. turning
constant ns-ns b-eld in the worldvolume of d(p + 4)-branes cause noncommutativity
in the worldvolume theory of d(p + 4)-branes, and adds feyet-iliopoulos d-term in the
worldvolume theory of dp-branes [15][10]. the equivalence of both descriptions follows
from the pioneering work of nekrasov and schwarz [11]. in order to construct instantons
on noncommutative r4, one adds a constant (corresponding to the feyet-iliopoulos term)
to the adhm equations.1 the modied adhm equations describe the resolutions of
singularities in the moduli space of instantons on r4 [7]. this moduli space has been an
important clue to the nonpertabative aspects of string theory [16][17][18][19][20][21]and
matrix theory [10][22][23][24][25]. further study from both string theory and noncommu-
tative geometry points of view was recently given by [14]. more recently, there appears a
paper which gives interesting viewpoints to the short scale spacetime structure [12].

in [11] nekrasov and schwarz explicitly constructed some instanton solutions and
showed that they are non-singular. the interesting point is that they are non-singular
even if their commutative counterparts are singular, so-called small instantons. in these
cases noncommutativity of the coordinates actually eliminates the singular behavior of
the eld congurations. what is special to the noncommutative case is the appearance
of projection operators which project out potentially dangerous states in fock space,
where fock space is introduced to describe the noncommutative r4 [11]. the purpose
of this paper is to investigate this mechanism. it is shown that this mechanism has rich
structures, and gives insight in the short scale structures near the core of instantons on
noncommutative space.

1the case of equivariant instanton is studied in [13].

1 preliminaries

in this section we briey review the theory of gauge eld on noncommutative r4 and
adhm construction on commutative r4, as preliminaries to adhm construction on
noncommutative r4.

1.1 gauge field on noncommutative r4
noncommutative r4 is described by algebra generated by x ( = 1,   , 4) obeying the
commutation relations:

[x, x] = i,

(1.1)

where  is real and constant. in this paper we restrict ourselves to the case where 
is self-dual and set2

12 = 34 =


4

.

then the algebra depends only one constant parameter .

introduce the generators of noncommutative c2  r4 by

z1 = x2 + ix1,

z2 = x4 + ix3 .

their commutation relations are:

[z1, z1] = [z2, z2] = 


2

,

(others: zero.)

(1.2)

(1.3)

(1.4)

we choose  > 0 . the commutation relations (1.1) has an automorphismes of the form
x 7 x + c, where c is a commuting real number. we denote the lie algebra of this
group by g . following [11], we start with the algebra end h of operators acting in
c|n1, n2i, where z, z are represented as creation and
the fock space h = p(n1,n2)z2

annihilation operators:

0



s 2
s 2



z1 |n1, n2i = n1 + 1|n1 + 1, n2i , s 2
z2 |n1, n2i = n2 + 1|n1, n2 + 1i , s 2





z1 |n1, n2i = n1 |n1  1, n2i ,
z2 |n1, n2i = n2 |n1, n2  1i .

(1.5)

we consider an algebra a consists of smooth operators a, i.e. aa is smooth ( is
understood as the action of g = r4 on a by translation). the u(n) gauge eld on

2see [14] for the meaning of this choice of parameter in string theory.

2

noncommutative r4 is dened as follows. first we consider n-dimensional vector space
e := (a)n which carries a right representation of a:3

e  a  (e, a) 7 ea  e,

e(ab) = (ea)b,

e(a + b) = ea + eb,
(e + e)a = ea + ea,

(1.6)

for any e, e  e and a, b  a. the elements of e can be thought of as an n-dimensional
vector with entries in a. let us consider the unitary action of u to the element of e:

e  ue,

(1.7)

where u is a nn matrix with its components in a, satisfying uu = uu = idaidn .
idn is a n  n identity matrix. under the action of this unitary transformation, de, the
covariant derivative of e  e, is required to transform covariantly:

the covariant derivative d is written as

de  ude.

d = d + a.

(1.8)

(1.9)

here the u(n) gauge eld a is introduced to ensure the covariance, as explained below.
a is a matrix valued one-form: a = adx with a being anti-hermitian n  n matrix.
the action of exterior derivative d is dened as:

da := (a) dx,

a  a.

(1.10)

dxs commute with x and anti-commute among themselves, and hence d2a = 0 for
a  a. from (1.7) and (1.8), the covariant derivative transforms as

hence the gauge eld a transforms as

d  udu.

the eld strength is dened by

a  udu + uau.

f := d2 = da + a2.

(1.11)

(1.12)

(1.13)

for later purpose, let us consider projection operator p  a, p  = p, p 2 = p . for
every projection operator p , we can consider n-dimensional vector space pe,4where the

3e is a right module over a. see, for example, [26][27].
4pe is a right projective module over a .

3

element of pe can be thought of as n-dimensional vector with entries in the form p a,
a  a. we can construct covariant derivative dp for pe by

dp = p d + a, a = p ap.

notice that dp = p dp . the unitary transformation on pe is given by

e  up e, up  p up,

(1.14)

(1.15)

where u again satises uu = uu = ida  idn . we require dp e to transform as

then the covariant derivative dp must transform as

dp e  up dp e.

dp  up dp up .

for any e  pe,

up dp up e = up (p d + a)up e = up dp (up e) + up aup e

= up p dup e + p up (up de) + up aup e
= p de + (up dup + up aup )e.

(up p = p up )

hence the gauge eld a transforms as

the eld strength becomes

a  up dup + up aup .

f := d2

p

(1.16)

(1.17)

(1.18)

(1.19)

= p da + a2 + p dp dp.

(1.20)

indeed, for e  pe,

f e = (p d + a)(p de + ae)

= p d(p de) + p d(ae) + ap de + a2e
= p d(p de) + p dae + a2e,

and since e = p e and p 2 = p ,

p d(p de) = p d(p d(p e))

= p d(p dp e + p de)
= p dp dp e  p dp de + p dp de
= p dp dp e.

(1.21)

(1.22)

gauge eld a is called anti-self-dual, or instanton, if its eld strength satises the

conditions:

(f + f ) = 0,

(1.23)

where  is the hodge star.5

1.2 review of adhm construction on commutative r4

adhm construction of instantons [6] is the way to obtain anti-self-dual gauge eld on r4
from solutions of some quadratic matrix equations. more specically, in order to construct
anti-self-dual u(n) gauge eld with instanton number k , one starts from the following
data :

1. a pair of complex hermitian vector spaces v = ck and w = cn .

2. the operators b1, b2  hom(v, v ), i  hom(w, v ), j = hom(v, w ) satisfying

the equations

r = [b1, b1] + [b2, b2] + ii  jj = 0,
c = [b1, b2] + ij = 0.

next dene dirac-like operator dz : v  v  w  v  v by

z ! ,

dz =   z
z = ( b2  z2, b1  z1, i ),
z = ((b1  z1), b2  z2, j ).

(1.24) is equivalent to the set of equations

zz = zz,

zz = 0,

(1.24)

(1.25)

(1.26)

which are important conditions in adhm construction. there are n zero-modes of dz :
(1.27)

a = 1, . . . , n.

dz(a) = 0,

we can choose orthonormalized basis of the space of zero-modes:

5in this paper we only consider the case where the metric on r4 is at: g = .

(a)(b) = ab.

(1.28)

5

the change of basis in the space of orthonormalized zero-modes (a) become u(n) gauge
symmetry. anti-self-dual u(n) gauge eld is constructed by the formula

there is an action of u(k) that does not change (1.29) :

aab = (a)d(b).

(b1, b2, i, j) 7 (gb1g1, gb2g1, gi, jg1),

g  u(k).

(1.29)

(1.30)

the moduli space of anti-self-dual u(n) gauge eld with instanton number k is given by

m(k, n) = 1

r (0)  1

c (0)/u(k).

(1.31)

where the action of u(k) is the one given in (1.30). when (b1, b2, i, j) is a xed point of
u(k) action, m(k, n) is singular. such singularity corresponds to the instanton shrinking
to zero size.

2 adhm construction on noncommutative r4 and

the appearance of projection operator

the singularities in (1.31) has a natural resolution [7]. modify (1.24) to

r = [b1, b1] + [b2, b2] + ii  jj =  idv ,
c = [b1, b2] + ij = 0,

and consider the space

m(k, n) = 1

r ( idv )  1

c (0) /u(k).

(2.1)

(2.2)

then m(k, n) is a smooth 4kn dimensional hyper-kahler manifold. although the
absence of singularities is interesting from the physical point of view, construction of
instantons from (2.1) does not work straightforwardly. the main obstruction is that the
key equation (1.26) is not satised on the usual commutative r4. however, nekrasov and
schwarz noticed that z, z do satisfy (1.26) if the coordinates are noncommutative as
in (1.4) [11]. once (1.26) is satised, we can expect that the construction of instantons
is similar to the usual commutative case. but there are some features peculiar to the
noncommutative case. especially, since the adhm construction on noncommutative r4
starts from (2.2) where small instanton singularities have been resolved, one expects that
crucial dierence will appear when the size of the instanton is small. it is interesting to
study such situations and see how the eects of noncommutativity appear.

6

adhm construction on noncommutaive r4 is as follows [11]. we dene operator

dz : (v  v  w )  a  (v  v )  a by the same formula (1.25):

z ! ,

dz =   z
z = ( b2  z2, b1  z1, i )
z = ((b1  z1), b2  z2, j ).

the operator dzdz : (v  v )  a  (v  v )  a has a block diagonal form

dzdz =   z

0 z ! ,

0

z  zz = zz

(2.3)

(2.4)

which is a consequence of (1.26) and important for adhm construction. next we look
for solutions of the equation

dz(a) = 0 (a = 1, . . . , n),

(2.5)

where (a)s are operators: (a) : a  (v  v  w )a. if we can normalize (a)s as
(2.6)

(a)(b) ?= ab ida ,

we can construct anti-self-dual u(n) gauge eld by the same formula (1.29):

aab = (a)d(b),

(2.7)

where a, b are u(n) indices. then eld strength becomes

   (n ) 


,

1 : cn  a  v  a,
2 : cn  a  v  a,
 : cn  a  w  a.

the derivation is similar to the commutative case. (2.8) is anti-self-dual.

however, sometimes (a) annihilates some states in h for some a. by (a) annihilates
state we mean all the components of (a) annihilate that state. this is not a special

7

phenomenon, and the study of this kinds of zero-modes is the purpose of this paper. let
us consider the case where there is one such zero-mode (1).
in that case we cannot
normalize (1) as in (2.6). we may normalize (1) as

(1)(1) = p,

(2.9)

where p is the projection operator that projects out the states annihilated by (1). how-
ever, the existence of the projection operator in (2.9) gives additional contribution to the
eld strength, because the projection operator depends on z and z.6 the derivative of
the projection operator gives additional contribution to the eld strength, which is not
anti-self-dual.

the appearance of projection operator p indicates that we should consider restricted
indeed, as we will see shortly, adhm construction

vector space pe rather than e.
perfectly works in this setting.

from hereafter we will concentrate on the simplest u(1) instanton solutions (until

section 4). let us consider covariant derivative (1.14):

dp = p d + a,

with a = p ap . the eld strength is given by (1.20):

f = p da + a2 + p dp dp.

we can construct anti-self-dual gauge eld by putting

a = dp,

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

where  is a zero-mode of dz and normalized as  = p . note that  = p . let us
check that (2.12) is really anti-self-dual. the rst term in (2.11) becomes

the last term above can be rewritten as

p da = p ddp  p ddp.

p ddp = p (d()  d)dp
= p dp dp  p ddp.

(2.13)

(2.14)

the rst term in (2.14) cancels p dp dp in (2.11). the last term in (2.14) vanishes when
acting on e = p e  pe, since dp p = p d(1  p )p = 0. the second term in (2.11)
becomes

a2 = p ddp

= p (d())  d)dp
= p dp d  p ddp.
 z1 z1+z2 z2 : , where : : means normal ordering.

6for example, |0, 0ih0, 0| =: e 2

(2.15)

8

the rst term in (2.15) vanishes because p dp  = p d(1  p )p  = 0. then the eld
strength becomes

f = p d(1  )dp

= p f p = f ,

(2.16)

where f  is dened in (2.8) and is anti-self-dual.

the absence of the singular behavior in the eld conguration follows rather straight-
forwardly from above constructions. in the commutative case, source of divergence is the
normalization factor of the (a) in (1.29). at small instanton singularity, the solution
of (1.27) is trivial, i.e. (a) = 0 and cannot dene norm of the zero-mode. however,
in the noncommutative case, we only normalize  in the subspace where  has norm.
moreover, as shown in appendix a, z has no zero-mode and hence its inverse does not
cause divergence. therefore from the explicit formula (2.8), we can see that there is no
source of divergence in (2.8) or (2.16).

3 u (1) instantons and projection operators

3.1 projection operators in u (1) instanton solutions and rela-

tion to the ideal

in the previous section i have explained how to construct anti-self-dual gauge eld when
the zero-mode annihilates some states. then the natural question is: how the states
annihilated by zero-mode are determined? in this section we will answer this question
when the gauge group is u(1).

let us consider the solution of the equation

dz |ui = 0,

(3.1)

where |ui  hk  hk  h, i.e. the components of |ui are vectors in the fock space
h. we call |ui vector zero-mode and call  in (2.5) operator zero-mode. we can
construct operator zero-mode if we know all the vector zero-modes. the advantage of
considering vector zero-modes is that we can relate them to the ideal discussed in [8][9].
the point is that we can regard vector zero-modes as holomorphic bundle described in
purely commutative terms. noncommutativity appear when we construct operator zero-
mode treating all the vector zero-modes as a whole.

let us write

|ui = 


|u1i
|u2i
| f i

,




|u1i  u1(z1, z2) | 0, 0 i
|u2i  u2(z1, z2) | 0, 0 i
| f i  f (z1, z2) | 0, 0 i

9

(3.2)

where |u1i ,|u2i  hk i.e. they are vectors in v = ck and vectors in h, and | f i  h.
7 is
the space of the solutions of (3.1) , i.e. ker dz = ker z  ker z  ker z/im z
isomorphic to the ideal i dened by

i = n f (z1, z2) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

f (b1, b2) = 0 o.

(3.3)

in u(1) case, one can show j = 0, and the isomorphism is given by the inclusion of the
third factor in (3.2) [8][9].

ker z/im z  oc2 :

|ui = 


|u1i
|u2i
| f i




let us dene ideal state by

 f (z1, z2).

(3.4)

|i  ideal states of i  f (z1, z2)  i,

|i = f (z1, z2) |0, 0i ,

(3.5)

and denote the space of all the ideal states by hi. we dene h/i
orthogonal to hi :

8 as a subspace in h

|gi  h/i  f (z1, z2)  i,

f(z1, z2) |gi = 0.

(3.6)

h/i is a k dimensional space. let us denote the complete basis of h/i by | g i ,  =
1, 2,   , k, and the complete basis of hi by | fi i , i = k + 1, k + 2,  . they together span
complete basis of h. we can label them by positive integer n :

{ | hn i , n  z+.} = { | g i , | fi i ,  = 1, 2,   , k, i = k + 1, k + 2,   }.

(3.7)

as we can see from (3.4), zero-modes (3.1) are completely determined by the ideal fi(z1, z2)
[9]:

|u(fi)i = 


|u1(fi)i
|u2(fi)i
| fi i

.




we can construct operator zero-mode (2.5) by the following formula:

 = xi xn

()in |u(fi)ihhn| ,

(3.8)

(3.9)

understood as follows: the condition ker 

7notice that since zz = 0 ((1.26)), ker z/im z is well dened. ker z  ker 
z  ker z/im z is
z |u i = 0 xes the gauge freedom mod im z in ker z/im z.
8the meaning of this notation is as follows: h/i corresponds to c[z1, z2]/i, where c[z1, z2] is the

ring of polynomials of z1, z2.

10

where ()in is a commuting number. we call 0 minimal zero-mode if it has the form:

0 = xi,j

(0)ij |u(fi)ihfj| ,

j, i

such that

(0)ij 6= 0,

(3.10)

i.e. (0)in = 0 for n =  = 1, 2,   , k. we call it normalized minimal zero-mode if it is
normalized in hi:

00 = p,

(3.11)

where p is a projection operator that project out the states in h/i. the uniqueness of the
minimal zero-mode (up to gauge transformation) is shown in appendix b. from above
denition, 0 |i = 0 for |i  h/i. note that if we write

0 = 


1
2


,




(3.12)

then  |i = 0  1 |i = 2 |i = 0. hence the states annihilated by minimal zero-mode
0 are completely determined by .

the interesting point is that the noncommutative operator  innit runk matrix
appear from ideal described in purely commutative terms, by treating innit number of
the elements of ideal at one time.

as an illustration, let us construct u(1) one-instanton solution from the ideal. first,
let us recall u(1) one-instanton solution constructed in [11]. the solution to the modied
adhm equation (2.1) is given by

(3.13)

.

(3.14)

(z1z1 + z2 z2)




b1 = b2 = 0,

i = q , j = 0.

there is a solution 0 to the equation dz 0 = 0 :
 z2 z1

1
2


0 = 





= 


notice that all the components of 0 annihilates |0, 0i. as a consequence 0
0 = (z1 z1 +
z2 z2)(z1z1 + z2 z2 + ) annihilates |0, 0i. the inverse of (z1 z1 + z2 z2) is only dened in the
subspace of fock space where |0, 0i is projected out:

(z1 z1 + z2z2)1 = p (z1z1 + z2z2)1p,

where p is a projection operator that project out |0, 0i. hence

0 = 0( 0

0)1/2

11

(3.15)

(3.16)

is normalized as 00 = p .

let us reconstruct this zero-mode from ideal. the ideal which corresponds to (3.13)
is i = (z1, z2). the basis vector of the h/i is |0, 0i which is orthogonal to all the ideal
states. we can use |n1, n2i , (n1, n2) 6= (0, 0) as basis vectors of hi , the space of ideal
states. the solutions of dz |ui = 0 are given by

,




(n1, n2) 6= (0, 0).

(3.17)

|un1n2i = 


n2 |n1, n2  1i
n1 |n1  1, n2i
12 (n1 + n2) |n1, n2i
from (3.17), we obtain operator zero-mode dz = 0 :

 = x(m1,m2)6=(0,0) x(n1,n2)

()(m1,m2)(n1,n2) |um1m2i hn1, n2| ,

the normalized minimal zero mode 0 is required to satisfy

0 = x(m1,m2)6=(0,0) x(n1,n2)6=(0,0)
00 = ida  |0, 0ih0, 0| .

()(m1,m2)(n1,n2) |um1m2ihn1, n2| ,

from the normalization condition in (3.19), it follows

(3.18)

(3.19)

x(m1,m2)6=(0,0)

(m1 + m2)(m1 + m2 + 2) ()(l1,l2)(m1,m2)()(m1,m2)(n1,n2) = (l1,l2)(n1,n2).

(3.20)

the solution of (3.20) is

(0)(m1,m2)(n1,n2) = s

2

(n1 + n2)(n1 + n2 + 2)

(m1,m2)(n1,n2) .

(3.21)

(3.19) , (3.21) are equivalent to (3.14),(3.16).

3.2 some u (1) instanton solutions

construction of operator zero-mode from vector zero-modes is useful for understanding
the notion of minimal zero-mode. but for actual calculation it is more easier to directly
look for the operator zero-mode. it is interesting to see that the obtained operator zero-
modes really annihilate states in h/i.

u (1) two-instanton solution9

let us study the two-instanton solutions degenerating at the origin. the corresponding
solution of the matrix equations (2.1) is given by

b1 =   0 1

0 ! , b2 =   0 2

0

0

0 ! , i =   0

2 ! , j = 0.

(3.22)

where 1 and 2 are complex numbers satisfying |1|2 + |2|2 = 1 . notice that b1 and
b2 are upper half triangle matrices. 1, 2 (partially) remember the direction before two
instantons collide [9][19]. the corresponding ideal is i = (z2
1, 2z1 + 1z2). hence the
state orthogonal to all the ideal states is annihilated by z2
1, 2 z1 + 1z2. the states
annihilated by z2
1 is |0, n2i , |1, n2i for all non-negative integer n2. the states annihilated
by 2 z1 + 1z2 are better be described by the fock space constructed by rotated creation
and annihilation operators z:

z2  2z1 + 1z2,

z1  1z1 + 2z2,
|0, 0i = |0, 0i ,
s 2
s 2





z1 |n1, n2i = qn1 + 1 |n1 + 1, n2i , s 2
z2 |n1, n2i = qn2 + 1 |n1, n2 + 1i , s 2





z1 |n1, n2i = qn1 |n1  1, n2i ,
z2 |n1, n2i = qn2 |n1, n2  1i .

(3.23)

then, the states annihilated by z2 = 2 z1 + 1 z2 are |n1, 0i for all non-negative n1 .
therefore the basis vectors of the states orthogonal to all the ideal states is |0, 0i ,|1, 0i
now let us study operator zero-mode. the (unnormalized) minimal zero mode can be
directly obtained from (3.22):

4 u (n ) instantons and projection operators

in the previous section we have claried the notion of minimal zero-mode for u(1) case. in
this section we will study the u(2) instanton solutions and see that projection of states by
zero-modes also occur. since the u(n) instanton solutions are essentially embedding of
u(2) instanton solutions to u(n), this means projection of states is general phenomenon
in instantons on noncommutative r4. in the following, we will observe two things.

1. minimal zero-mode appear in the u(1) subgroup of u(2) gauge group. it annihilates

some states even when the size of instanton is not small.

2. when the size of instanton becomes small, only the contribution from u(1) subgroup

described by the minimal zero-mode remains.

although we have not dened minimal zero-mode for u(n) case, the zero-modes similar
to minimal zero-mode in u(1) case appear in the explicit solutions. hence in the above
we have also called them minimal zero-modes. the second observation can be understood
as follows. we may dene small instanton on noncommutative r4 as j = 0 solution of
modied adhm equations (2.1). then, the solution is essentially the embedding of u(1)
instantons to u(n).

u (2) one-instanton solution

the solution to the modied adhm equation (2.1) is given by11

11there are of course family of solutions with dierent orientation in gauge group u (2). the resulting

i = (cid:16) 2 +  0 (cid:17) ,

j = (cid:16) 0  (cid:17) ,

(4.1)

b1 = b2 = 0,

conclusions are same.

(4.3)

the zero-mode (1) is a straightforward modication of (3.16). (1) annihilates |0, 0i for
any values of , and normalized in the subspace where |0, 0i is projected out. the zero-
mode (2) annihilates no states in h and manifestly nonsingular even if  = 0. when
 = 0, (2)
2 = 0 , and from (2.8) (2) does not contribute to the eld strength.
therefore the structure of the instanton at  = 0 is completely determined by the u(1)
subgroup described by minimal zero-mode (1).

1 = (2)

u (2) two-instanton solution

we can also construct two-instanton solution and check the statements in the beginning
of section. here we only construct one simple solution. the solution of modied adhm
equation (2.1) is given by

(1) is a slight modication of (3.24) with (1, 2) = (1, 0). it annihilates |0, 0i ,|1, 0i.
(2) is apparently non-singular. hence when the size of the instanton is small, only the
u(1) subgroup described by (1) is relevant.

conclusions

in this paper we have learned that the appearance of projection operator is a general
phenomenon in adhm construction on noncommutative r4. the interesting point is
that the instanton solutions are always smooth, since projection operators project out
potentially dangerous states from the begining. although the smoothness of the solutions
follows straightforwardly from the noncommutative setting, such mechanism is peculiar
to noncommutative space and similar phenomenon cannot be expected in commutative
setting.

since the small instantons have been a good clue to the nonpertabative aspects of
string theory, we expect our results also have applications in string theory and matrix
theory.

a the absence of zero-mode of z

in this section we show that z in (2.4) has no zero-mode. suppose

for some |vi , where |vi  hk , i.e. |vi is vector in v = ck and veceor in h. then,

z |vi = 0

(a.1)

hv| z |vi = 0
 hv| zz |vi .

= hv| (b1  z1)(b1  z1) |vi + hv| (b2  z2)(b2  z2) |vi + hv| ii |vi = 0,
hv| zz |vi
= hv| (b1  z1)(b1  z1) |vi + hv| (b2  z2)(b2  z2) |vi + hv| jj |vi = 0.

(a.2)

(a.3)

 (b1  z1) |vi = 0,
(b1  z1) |vi = 0,

(b2  z2) |vi = 0,
(b2  z2) |vi = 0,

i |vi = 0,
j |vi = 0.

from (a.2),

hence |vi = 0.

hv|  |vi = hv| [b1, b1] + [b2, b2] + ii  jj |vi

= hv| [z1, z1] + [z2, z2]|vi .
= hv|  |vi ,

b the uniqueness of the normalized minimal zero-

mode

in this appendix we show the uniqueness of the normalized minimal zero-mode (up to
gauge transformation) when the gauge group is u(1). let us consider operator zero-mode
which has the following form:

0 = xi,j

(0)ij |u(fi)ihfj| .

then its norm is:

where

00 = x(0)ik(0)lj |fiihu(fk)|u(fl)ihfj| ,

hu(fk)|u(fl)i = hu1(fk)|u1(fl)i + hu2(fk)|u2(fl)i + hfk|fli .

18

(b.1)

(b.2)

(b.3)

let us rewrite the equation dz |u(fi)i = 0 as

d u(fi) = fi,

(b.4)

where

d =   b2  z2

|u2(fi)i ! ,
(b1  z1) b2  z2 ! , u(fi) =   |u1(fi)i

b1  z1

fi =   |fii i

0 ! .

(b.5)

since the correspondence between the elements of ideal and vector zero-modes is one-to-
one, we can consider inverse operator of d:

then, (b.3) can be written as

u(fi) = 

1
d

fi.

hu(fk)|u(fl)i
= u(fk) u(fl) + fk fl = fk (cid:18) 1
= hfk|(cid:18)i(cid:18) 1
i + 1(cid:19)|fli ,

dd(cid:19)1 1

dd

+ 1(cid:19) fl

where we denote the components of (dd)1 as

(dd)1 =   (dd)1

1 1
(dd)1
2 1

(dd)1
1 2
(dd)1

2 2 ! .

(b.6)

(b.7)

(b.8)

from (b.7), the matrix ckl = hu(fk)|u(fl)i has no zero-eigenvalue-vector and we can
consider (c1)kl. the normalized minimal zero-mode is uniquely determined (up to phase
factor):

(0)ij = (c1/2)ij.
