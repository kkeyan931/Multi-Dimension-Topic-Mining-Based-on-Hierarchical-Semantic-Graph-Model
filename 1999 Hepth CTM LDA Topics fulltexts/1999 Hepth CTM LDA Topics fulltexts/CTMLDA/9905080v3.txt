tachyon condensation in rotated brane congurations

department of physics, box 390, university of colorado, boulder, co 80309.

abstract

the decay of rotated brane congurations and the corresponding condensation of
tachyons is discussed. in a certain iib orbifold case a heuristic argument about the mass
of the state living on the xed plane is made. when the rotation angle is  this mass
agrees with that obtained by sen.

1 introduction

in the last year there has been signicant progress in understanding certain non-bps
states in string theory.
in particular it has been shown by sen [1]-[4] that there are
unstable non-bps dp-branes with even (odd) p in type iib (iia) branes and a stable
non-bps d-particle in type i theory. in the case of iia and iib too one could stabilize
the non-bps branes by dividing out by certain z2 symmetries. a stable d-particle
state in type iib was explicitly constructed using the boundary state formalism in [5].
the relation of these developments to k-theory has been pointed out in [6] where some
new insights have been obtained. these have been analyzed using the boundary state
formalism in [7]1.

all the above considerations were made in the context of (anti-) parallel brane con-
gurations. in this paper we wish to consider situations where branes are not parallel
(or anti-parallel). we will begin with a review of the evaluation of the partition function
for open strings with ends on two d-branes, one of which is rotated with respect to the
other, and the observation that there is a tachyon in the system for general angles when
the distance between the branes is less than a certain critical value. we argue that (at
least when the brane directions are compact) this tachyon represents an instability of the
system to decay into a bps brane which is obtained from the vector sum of the charges of
the original branes. next we construct boundary states corresponding to such d-branes
and verify that they are consistent with open string closed string duality. we consider,
closely following sens work [2], this system in type iib/z2 where the z2 is generated by
a reection in four coordinates times (1)fl, compactify one direction (which is common
to both branes) on a circle, and put a wilson line on it. upon tachyon condensation, it is
argued that we now have a solitonic state on the orbifold xed plane whose mass depends
on the angle of rotation between the d-branes, in addition to a brane that stretches be-
tween the two xed planes. when the angle is  (corresponding to one of the branes
being an anti-brane) the charge and hence mass of the extended brane is zero, and the
mass of the soliton on the xed plane is equal to that calculated by sen. however unlike
in this latter case, for a general angle we have not been able to establish these results
rigorously, since it has not been possible to nd a conformal eld theory argument.

the calculations are performed in the double wick rotated light cone gauge formalism
adopted in [9],[2]. strictly speaking since in this formalism the time direction is transverse
to the brane (all directions parallel to the brane have positive metric) the congurations
are really (p+1)-instantons. however we will assume (as in [9],[2]) that this is equivalent
to a calculation with p-branes when done with all the ghost complications. we will take
the original time coordinate to be x2 and the light cone directions after wick rotation to
be x0, x1.

1for recent reviews of these developments see [8].

2 the open string partition function for rotated d-

branes

we begin by quoting a calculation given in [10] (section 13.4) for the open string
partition function, where strings have one end attached to a three-brane and the other
to another three brane, rotated with respect to the rst. actually the treatment in [10]
is for a four-brane, but in our framework this is to be interpreted as a four instanton
that is equivalent to a double wick rotated 3-brane. one of the three branes is oriented
along the x2, x4, x6, x8 (it should be remembered that x2 is really time) directions and
the other is rotated with respect to this by an angle 1 in the x2  x3 plane, 2 in the
x4  x5 plane etc with 0 < i < . in our convention the rst rotation would correspond
to a lorentz transformation when we wick rotate back. the result of the calculation is

where we have taken the distance between the branes to be y. let us specialize to the
case when three of the angles are zero. the 11 function in the denominators blow up
when  = 0 and one needs to substitute i11( it

(13.4.24)of [10]) for the three parallel directions (each of whose size is taken to be l).

which diverges at y2 < 2 in agreement with (2.4).

we note that  =  is equivalent to replacing one of the branes by an anti-brane2. in
this case the tachyonic mode reects the annihilation of the brane anti-brane pair into
the vacuum.

the tachyonic mode represents an instability in the system for distances less than
yc.
in particular at zero distance one expects the state to decay into the bps state
corresponding to the vector sum of the two rr charges of the branes3. if the two states
have rr charges q1,2 with unit magnitude then q1.q2 = cos , and the mass of this
state is given by4,

mp() = lptp|q1 + q2| = 2lptp(1 + cos )

2 = 2lptp cos

,

(2.5)

where tp is the p-brane tension and l ( ) is the size of the spatial directions in which
the brane is wound.
note that the above result makes sense only in the compactied case where (at least)
the plane of rotation is on a two torus. the factor 2 cos 
2 is just the geometrical factor
that comes from the length of the nal brane if we had started with initial branes of unit
length.

it is possible that our conjecture that the two rotated brane conguration decays
into the above bps state can be established along the lines of [11] and [3]. the case
considered in [11] is one where tachyon condensation on the d0-d2 system (or a dp-d(p-
2) system) gives a d(p-2) brane with magnetic ux on it. our case is related to this in
that a rotated brane is t-dual to one with magnetic ux on it. thus we believe that the
conjecture is very plausible since the above bps state is the lowest state with the same
quantum numbers as the starting conguration. one puzzling aspect of this however is
that the tachyon would be expected to be localized to the region of intersection of the two
branes, but its condensation must result in changing the energy density over the whole
conguration. this issue of course obtains even in tachyon condensation in, for instance,
the d2-d0 case, where the tachyon would be localized at the location of the d0-brane.
this is a question that needs to be investigated further5.

3 boundary states

the boundary state formalism was used to discuss open closed string duality in a series
of papers by the authors of [12] and in [13]6. here we will construct boundary states

2this is because at  =  the rr exchange term ips sign compared to its value at  = 0
3it has been argued in [10] that in the case when all directions are non-compact, the d-branes
reconnect and move apart indenitely. on the other hand in the compact case there is a lower bound to
the energy and the scenario discussed in this paper should be valid when we consider the system with
the plane in which the rotation is made to be a two torus with radii tending to innity.

4this can be established by an argument along the lines of the one given on page 168 of [10].
5i wish to thank a. sen for commenting on this.
6this formalism was extended to the discussion of d-branes in [14]. for references on the boundary

state formalism which are closely related to the discussion in this section see [15],[16],[17].

corresponding to branes at angles and check open closed string duality. instead of working
with rotated branes we will turn on a ten dimensional gauge eld (with constant eld
strength f ) and follow closely the discussion in [12]. in the d-brane context the eld
strength components in the parallel parallel directions will be magnetic elds living on the
d-brane while the parallel perpendicular eld strengths will correspond to a rotation of
the brane through the relation x = 2f 
xk. henceforth we will write 2f  f .

note that the born-infeld pre-factor in the nsns state is derived in [12] and the relative
normalization of the nsns and the rr states is a consequence of supersymmetry as
shown there. the above are obtained from those given in [12] by t-duality. the absolute
normalization will be xed later by comparison with the open string calculation [10]
reviewed in the previous section. the gso projected boundary states are then

cone directions).

be written as |k >= |p+(f )kr > in terms of the right moving momentum eigenvalue kr.
the states are normalized as < k|k >= (k  k), and the transverse position state is
then given by,

|x >= z dk(p(f )k)ei(p+(f )k)t .x|k >

this checks the open string closed string duality for rotated branes. in particular when
three of the phis are zero and one is equal to  we get the result for brane anti-brane
interaction given in section 2.1 of [2].

4 rotated d-branes on a z2 orbifold

let us, following sen [2], consider an orbifold (of iib string theory) generated by

g = (1)fli4, i4 : x6,7,8,9  x6,7,8,9

(4.1)

where (1)f
ground states. for concreteness we again consider a 3-brane but this time we take

l acts as -1 on the left moving ramond ground state and is +1 on all other

xk = {x2, x3, x4, x8}, x = {x5, x6, x7, x9}.

(4.2)

the light cone directions are as before {x0, x1} and we are working again in the double
wick rotated formalism where x2 is the euclideanized time. we take one brane to be
stretched along the above xk directions and the other to be parallel to it in the 2,3 and 8
directions but rotated with respect to it in the 4  5 plane by an angle . as in [2] one
can check that

g|u, f >n sn s= |u, f >n sn s, g|u, f >rr= |u, f >rr .

(4.3)

in addition to these untwisted states there are twisted states that can be represented as

because of the orbifold condition the momentum integration is just over the perpendicular
directions that are not transverse to the orbifold xed plane. so we dene

| >n sn s;t = 2 n z dk0dk1|k,  >
| >rr;t = 2 n z dk0dk1|k,  > .

as in [2] the gso invariant twisted states are then given by

|t >n sn s =

the untwisted matrix elements are given by the same formulae as before (3.12-3.15) with
the replacements appropriate to the case when three of the angles are zero (see remark
after equation (2.1)). for the twisted ones we now get,

we have performed the transformation s = 
t in the expressions above and then compared
with the corresponding open string calculation. as in the previous discussion these
equations will also thus x the overall normalization constant n(f ).

the complete d-brane state is then dened (after changing the notation slightly by

replacing f in the state by the angle of rotation )

|d; , >=

(4.11)

where the states on the right hand side are dened in (3.5) and (4.9). it should be noted
that the anti-brane state is given as |d; 0, >= |d; , >. using the above results we
then have

note that the eect of replacing one of the branes by an anti-brane i.e.  =  on the
right hand side of this is equivalent to putting  = 0 but changing the sign in front of
(1)f .
now still following sen [2] we compactify the eight direction on a circle of radius r
and put a wilson line on one of the d-branes. the wave function then acquires a phase
ei (say) as one goes round the circle i.e. x8  x8 + 2r, and g invariance restricts the
values of  to 0, . now in the compactied space the orbifold action gives two xed
planes at x8 = 0, r. so it is convenient to start with a circle of radius 2r and introduce
two groups [2],

x6  x6, x7  x7, x8  x8 x9  x9, and (1)fl
x6  x6, x7  x7, x8  x8 + 2r x9  x9, and (1)fl.(4.13)

then we also have

g2g1 : x8  x8 + 2r.

(4.14)

so that modding out by this symmetry gives us back a circle of radius r. now we may
construct boundary states for this conguration by adding to the untwisted states the
two twisted sectors at the two orbifold planes.

5 tachyon condensation

let us label the d-branes by the coecients q1 = , q2 = ei of the twisted sector states
|t 1, 2 > at each orbifold plane. there are four possibilities for (q1, q2); a)(+,+), b)(-,-),
c)(+,-), d)(-,+). if we take a) and c) together then the masses (per unit volume in the
xed plane directions) in the ground state, after tachyon condensation, of the states at
the two ends 0, r of the compact direction may be written as m++ at one end and m+
at the other. this is a situation with a wilson line ( = ) at one end. the tachyon
eld is then anti-periodic in the eighth direction and the corresponding momentum is
quantized in half integral units k8 = n+ 1

r . the lowest mode then has mass

2

this becomes marginal at the critical radius

m2() =

1
4r2 



2

rc = s 

2

(5.1)

(5.2)

as in [2] at this radius the mass (per unit volume in the xed plane directions) of the
conguration may be taken to be that of the two branes (taken now to be p-branes),

mc() = 2tprc = 2

1

g(2)p()p+1s 

2

=

1

g(2)(p1)()ps 

2

= s 

2

tp1.

(5.3)
the above depends on the assumption that at the critical radius rc (above which a
tachyonic mode appears) the original conguration becomes degenerate with the nal
one. this is tantamount to the assumption that the tachyon is exactly marginal at
the critical radius. unfortunately unlike in the brane anti-brane case where there is a
conformal eld theory proof [4], for general angles we are unable to do better than the
above heuristic argument.

now in section 2 we argued that the unstable conguration of two non-parallel d
branes in at space decays into a bps state with mass given by (2.5). let us write
ms = mp()r/lp.
in the present case the tachyon has kinks at the orbifold xed
planes x8 = 0, r (see [2]) and correspondingly we expect solitonic states localized on
the xed planes. then for radius r the mass per unit (p-1) volume (transverse to the
compactied direction) of the ground state conguration is conjectured to be given by,

this expression is constructed so that it gives the formula obtained above (5.3) at the
critical radius rc. at  = 0 it reduces to twice the mass of the two p-branes and at

 = , the brane anti-brane case, one gets tp1/2 the mass derived by sen [2],[4]. the

second term is the mass of the bps state stretched between the two orbifold planes and
so we expect the rst term to be the total mass of the states localized on the orbifold
planes. i.e.

m++ + m+ = tp1s

now let us consider the combination of the branes a) and b). in this case there is no
wilson line but only states odd under g1 and g2 are projected in. the k8 = 0 mode is
projected out and the lowest open string mode has k8 =  1

r and its mass is given by,

giving a critical radius of

m2 = k2

in this situation we have a state of mass m+ at each end. reasoning as before this leads
to the equation

m+ = tp1s

using (5.5) this gives

note that for  = 0, m+ = 0 and for  =  (the brane-anti-brane case) we get the value
obtained by sen [2].

m++ = 0

the twisted state rr charge of the nal conguration must be equal to the twisted
sector charge of the initial conguration at each end. the nal brane stretched between
the two orbifold planes also has twisted sector charge at each end and if this does not
match the initial conguration charges at either end then there must be a solitonic state
at that end. now at the x8 = 0 end one may reason as follows. the twisted sector charge
vector at this end is proportional to the untwisted sector charge, and given the untwisted
charges q1, q2 of the two initial branes the total twisted sector charge of the initial

conguration would be proportional to q1 + q2 (see equation (4.15) and the discussion
at the begining of section 5). but the untwisted sector charge of the nal brane stretched
between the two xed planes is q1 + q2 and hence its twisted sector charge at the x8 = 0
end is equal to that of the initial conguration. hence there is no residual twisted sector
charge at this end and one would expect the mass of a ++ state at this end to be zero.
this is consistent with the above result m++ = 0.

at the x8 = r end however the the total twisted sector rr charge of the initial
branes is proportional to q1  q2 (we have taken the wilson line ei = 1 for the rst
brane and -1 for the second). but the untwisted sector charge of the nal brane is the
sum of the two charges and hence its twisted sector charge is proportional to (q1 + q2)
(here we have also used the sign ambiguity coming from the possibility of assigning either
 =  to the end of the nal brane). thus (for either sign) there is a discrepancy in the
twisted sector charges at this end which must therefore indicates the presence of a p  1
dimensional soliton living at this end carrying charge proportional to 2q1 or 2q2. this
accounts for the state with non-zero mass m+ obtained above. the fact that this charge
is independent of the angle  while the mass m+ depends on the angle presumably
means that this p  1 dimensional soliton is bound to the p dimensional brane and the
angular dependence reects the binding energy7.
