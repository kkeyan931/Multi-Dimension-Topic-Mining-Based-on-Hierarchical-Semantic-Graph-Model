gravitating thooft-polyakov magnetic monopoles can be constructed when coupling the
georgi-glashow model to gravitation. for a given value of the higgs boson mass, these gravi-
tating solitons exist up to a critical value of the ratio of the vector meson mass to the planck
mass. the critical solution is characterized by a degenerate horizon of the metric. as pointed
out recently by lue and weinberg, two types of critical solutions can occur, depending on the
value of the higgs boson mass. here we investigate this transition for dyons and show that
the lue and weinberg phenomenon is favorized by the presence of the electric-charge degree of
freedom.

i. introduction

the georgi-glashow (gg) model consists of an su(2) yang-mills eld coupled to a (real) higgs triplet. the
self interation of the higgs eld by means of a higgs potential leads to a spontaneous breakdown of the symmetry.
one distinguished feature of this model is that it admits topological solitons : the celebrated thooft-polyakov
monopoles [1,2].

by coupling the gg eld theory to gravitation, one obtains the su(2) einstein-georgi-glashow model. several
years ago, it was shown that gravitating magnetic monopoles, as well as non-abelian black holes, exist in a certain
domain of the space of the physical parameters of the model [35]. for instance for a xed value of the higgs boson
mass, the gravitating monopoles exist up to a critical value cr of the parameter  (the ratio of the vector meson
mass to the planck mass). at the critical value cr, a critical solution with a degenerate horizon is reached. in
particular, for small values of the higgs boson mass, the critical solution where a horizon rst appears corresponds
to an extremal reissner-nordstrm (rn) solution outside the horizon while it is non-singular inside.

recently lue and weinberg reconsidered the equations of the self-gravitating magnetic monopoles and dis-
covered an insofar not suspected phenomenon [6]. indeed for large enough values of the higgs boson mass, the
critical solution is an extremal black hole with non-abelian hair and a mass less than the extremal rn value. an
independent numerical analysis [7] of the equations has conrmed the results of lue and weinberg and reinforced
the agreement between the numerical solutions and the algebraic conditions these solutions have to obey.

during the last months, there was a growing interest devoted to monopole and dyons, considered as classical
solutions of the non-abelian einstein-born-infeld-higgs (ebih) model [810]. this is motivated by the fact that
the low energy eective action d-brane is related to a born-infeld model (see e.g. [11]). because born-infeld
models naturally contain a theta-term proportional to (f f  )2, their nonlinearities are better tested by the
dyons solutions which excite both magnetic and electric elds.

it is therefore natural to study if the gravitating dyons of the gg model are also sensitive to the lue and
weinberg eect and to see if the degree of freedom confering the classical lump its electric charge favorizes or
attenuates this eect.
in this report we extend the analysis of ref. [6] to the case of spherically symmetric
gravitating dyons. we show that the transition also occurs for dyons and that the phenomenon is enhanced by
the presence of the new eld describing the electric charge degree of freedom.

ii. the equations

we consider the su(2) einstein-georgi-glashow action [36]. in order to obtain static spherically symmetric

globally regular solutions we employ schwarzschild like coordinates for the metric

ds2 = a2n dt2 + n 1dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2) ,

(1)

1

and introduce, as usual, the mass function m(r) by means of

then we use the standard wu-yang ansatz for the spatial components of the gauge eld and the hedgehog ansatz
for the higgs elds (see e.g. [4,6])

n (r) = 1 

2m(r)

r

.

(2)

~ar = 0 ,

~a = ~e

1  k(r)

g

,

~a = ~e

1  k(r)

g

sin  ,

and

~ = ~erh(r)v ,

(3)

(4)

with the standard unit vectors ~er, ~e and ~e while v denotes the higgs elds vacuum expectation value. since
we want to describe dyon, we also employ the spherically symmetric ansatz for the time component of the gauge
eld [1214].

it is also convenient to introduce the dimensionless coordinate x and mass function ,

~a0 = vj(r)~er

.

as well as the dimensionless coupling constants , 

x = gvr ,  = gvm ,

2 = 4gv2

,

 =

mh
mw

,

(5)

(6)

(7)

where g is newtons constant, mh is the higgs boson mass and mw is the gauge boson mass.

with these ansatz and denitions, the classical equations of the model reduce to the following system of ve

coupled radial equations : [13,14]

2k 2

x2 + h 2!a ,

(8)

(9)

for the functions parametrizing the geometry (the prime indicates the derivative with respect to x); for the matter
functions we obtain the equations

(an k ) = ak(cid:18) k 2  1

x2 + h 2

(12)

the equations of motion depend on two physical parameters , . this form of the parameters are used in [5]
but several alternative notations were used in previous papers. in [6] they use a, b with

a = 22

,

b =

1

 2 =

 2 ,

(13)

and in passing we redened by  the parameter labelled  in [13,14].

in solving the equations, ,  are imposed by hand; the third physical parameter to be xed by hand is the

electric charge of the dyon, noted q. it is encoded [12,15] into the asymptotic behaviour of the function j(x)

j(x)|x = j 

q
x

+ o(

1
x2 )

(14)

the regularity of the solution at the origin, the niteness of the mass and the requirement that the metric (1)

so that q is imposed as a boundary condition of the function x2j  at x = .
approaches the minkowski metric for x   lead to the following set of boundary conditions [14]

(0) = 0 , k(0) = 1 , h(0) = 0 , j(0) = 0

a() = 1 , k() = 0 , h() = 1 ,

(x2j )|x = q .

(15)

(16)

which fully specify the problem.

in absence of gravity (i.e. a = 0, n = a = 1) the rst two equations are trivial and the solutions are the dyons
of julia and zee [12]. they were studied numerically in some details recently [15]. in particular, it was found
that for b = 0 dyons exist for an arbitrary value of q while for b 6= 0 the dyons exist only to a maximal value
qcr (see fig. 8 of [15]); for too high values of q the value j becomes larger than one and, as seen from eq.(10),
k becomes oscillating. within the range of  that we will explore in this paper (gravitating) dyons exist for
q  0.7.
the non-abelian gravitating dyon bifurcates at  = cr into an extremal rn solution with

the equations (8)-(12) were studied in details in [13,14] for the case  = 0. in particular, it was shown that

n (x) =

(x  p1 + q2)2

x2

, a(x) = 1

k(x) = 0 , h(x) = 1 , j(x) = q(

1
x

)

(17)

(18)

p1 + q2 

dened on x  [p1 + q2,]. in the next section we study the dyons solution for b > 0.

iii. gravitating dyons

in order to make the paper self consistent, we rst briey recall how the magnetic monopole solutions approach
critical solutions, when the vector boson mass, i.e. a, is varied, while the ratio of the higgs boson mass to the
vector boson mass, i.e. b, is kept xed. recently, lue and weinberg [6] realized that there are two regimes of b,
each with its own type of critical solution.

in the rst regime b is small (b < 25), and the metric function n (r) of the monopole solutions possesses a single
minimum. as the critical solution is approached, i.e. as a  acr, the minimum of the function n (r) decreases
until it reaches zero at r = r0. the limiting solution corresponds to an extremal rn black hole solution with
horizon radius rh = r0 and unit magnetic charge for r  r0. consequently, also the mass of the limiting solution

3

coincides with the mass of this extremal rn black hole. however, the limiting solution is not singular in the
interior region, r < r0. we refer to this limiting approach as rn-type behaviour.

in the second regime b is large, and the metric function n (r) of the monopole solutions develops a second
minimum as the critical solution is approached. this second minimum arises interior to the location of the rst
minimum, and decreases faster than the rst minimum. therefore, the critical solution is reached at r = r,
where the second minimum reaches zero. the critical solution thus possesses an extremal horizon at r < r0,
and corresponds to an extremal black hole with non-abelian hair and a mass less than the extremal rn value.
consequently, we refer to this second limiting approach as na-type (non-abelian-type) behaviour.

to summarize : the non-abelian gravitating monopole exist on a portion of the (a, b) plane limited by a curve
acr(b). somewhere on this curve (at (acr = 3/2, bcr  26.7)) there is a critical point separating the rn-type and
na-type of ending of the solution.
by solving eqs.(8) to (12) we were able to show that the same phenomenon occurs for dyon solutions. before
to present the details of the two regimes, we discuss the solutions in the case q = 1/2, b = 50 which is generic of
the na-type (the corresponding critical  is cr  0.83175).
the proles of the functions a, k, h at the approach of the critical value cr was described at length in [6]
and obey a similar pattern in the case of dyon. therefore we present here the proles of the functions n and j.
we found it instructive to superpose on our gures the proles of the functions

j
a

, b 

j
an

.

(19)

the ratio j/a naturally appears when one eliminates the function a (by using (9)) from the other equations. the
special combination b becomes a constant when the solution approaches an extremal rn black holes (17),(18).
moreover it takes the value

this can be checked from the numerical solutions.

brn =

q

p1 + q2

so on figs.1-4, the functions n, j, j/a, b are represented as functions of the variable y

(20)

(21)

x

.

y 

p1 + q2

it is such that y0 = 1 (with an obvious notation we also dene y as the value of the interior minimum of n).
figure 1 is drawn for  = 0.75, i.e. much before cr. the function n still present a unique minimum around
y = 1. figs. 2, 3 are obtained for  = 0.8315. now n has developped a second minimum at y  0.80. we
observe that j (and then also j/a and b) deviates only little from zero for y  [0, 0.8]. a little before y = 0.80
the function b increases very quickly to attain the value (20) around y = 1. we also notice that j/a develops a
ripple between the two minima on n . this general tendency of the functions is conrmed by fig. 4 drawn very
close to the critical . the function b here increases very steeply (in fact quasi linearly) from zero at y  0.795
to the value (20) at y = 1.
by solving the equations for several values of a,b and q we obtain a strong numerical evidence that the two
behaviours found in [6] persist in the case of dyons. this statement is illustrated by figs. 5,6 where the ratio
y = r/r0 characterizing the na-type of behaviour is plotted respectively as a function q (for a few xed values
of b) and as a function of of b (for q = 0 and q = 1/2) [16]. the two gures indicates in particular that, when
q increases, the na-type appears for lower values of b.

corresponding to fig. 6, the critical value acr is also plotted in fig. 7. the remarkable fact indicated by this
gure is that the line acr(b) in the (a, b) plane is independent of q (this was also observed in [14] for b = 0). only
the transition point (acr, bcr) is moving with q on the line.

the fact that the curve corresponding to q = 1/2 overtakes the value acr = 3/2 is not in contradiction with
[6] (i.e.
for q = 0). expanding the dyon equations around a double zero of the function n (r) (i.e. r = r or
r = r0) is the same way as in [6] would lead in principle to a q-depending critical value of a limiting the rn
and na-types. technically, it would involve the diagonalisation of a 3*3 matrix (rather than a 2*2) and leads to

4

a more involved algebra. however, owing that q is related to the asymptotic decay of the function j it is very
unlikely that an expansion of the solution around r (or r0) could lead to an explicit expression for acr(q) and
therefore we refrain from performing such an expansion.

clearly , figs.6,7 report data which is obtained from a numerical analysis of the equation and probably the
na-type solution (with q = 0 or q 6= 0) exists for still slightly lower values of b. these solutions cannot be
constructed because of the limitation in accuracy of our numerical routine. in order to support this statement we
report in fig. 8 the value nmin of the (rn-type) minimum of n when the internal minimum rst appears, this
as a function of b. as argued in [7] we believe that the transition between rn and na-types of behaviour occurs
just when this curve crosses zero. an extrapolation of the curves gives btr  26.7 for q = 0 and btr  18.7 for
q = 1/2.

iv. conclusion

the einstein-georgi-glashow model constitutes a good theoretical laboratory for testing the properties of
gravitational solitons. the solutions are particularly rich and obey non trivial patterns of bifurcations of several
types [5,13,14]. here we have analyzed numerically the equations for the spherically symmetric gravitating dyons
in this model, focusing our attention on the intermediate region of the higgs boson mass parameter.

our results gives strong evidence of two dierent scenarii of ending of the non-abelian dyons at some critical
value a = acr(b), conrming the recent result of [6]. three points desserve to be further stressed. (i) the domain
of existence of gravitating dyons in the (a,b) plane seems to be independant of q. (ii) the transition bewtween
the rn and na regime occurs at a q-depending value (acr, bcr) of the parameters. for monopole (q = 0) we
have acr = 3/2 , bcr  26.7. dyons have acr > 3/2 and the precise value depends (rather indirectly) on the charge
q. (iii) at non-zero values of b the dyons solutions exist up to a maximal value qcr(b), limiting the domain of
investigation of the equations.
