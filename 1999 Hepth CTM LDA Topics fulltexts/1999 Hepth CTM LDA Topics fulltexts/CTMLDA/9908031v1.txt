abstract

we argue that classical non-abelian gauge theory provides an example of t

hoofts scenario, in which quantum mechanics is generated at large distances

in a classical dynamical system. using the known properties of thermal eld

theories, we show how the transformation from classical to quantum dynamics

emerges. plancks constant h is dened in terms of the quantities of the

underlying classical eld theory.

the diculties encountered by attempts to quantize classical gravity raise the question

whether the fundamental description of nature at the planck scale is quantum mechanical

or classical. superstring theory [1] is based on the notion that classical general relativity is

the low-energy limit of a quantum theory that requires ten or more space-time dimensions

for internal consistency. the recent discovery of dualities relating several previously known

superstring theories has revealed that the ultimate interpretation of these theories is still

not entirely clear [2].

an alternative approach was suggested by t hooft [3]. if quantum (eld) theory would

be the low-energy limit of an underlying deterministic theory, the conict between general

relativity and quantum mechanics could be resolved in a dierent way.

t hooft argued

that the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics may have its origin in the dissipative nature

of the classical eld theory describing the fundamental structure of space-time [4]. the

argument is based on the idea that quantum states can originate as limit cycles of a classical

dissipative system, and it makes use of the fact that general relativity entails the mechanism

of information loss through black hole formation. however, a detailed mechanism for the

conjectured transformation has not been presented, so far.

the purpose of this note is to point out that a realization for the fundamental classical

scenario can be found in classical non-abelian gauge elds that are excited with a nonvan-

ishing, constant energy density. the transformation from a classical system to a quantum

system in the infrared limit occurs through a number of well-established mechanisms:

1. numerical calculations have provided strong evidence that (3+1)-dimensional, classical

non-abelian lattice gauge elds are globally hyperbolic dynamical systems [5]. this

conclusion is based on the calculation of the complete spectrum of lyapunov exponents

[6] and on the long-time statistical properties of the kolmogorov-sinai (ks) entropy

density of the su(2) lattice gauge theory [7]. it implies that the correlation functions

of all physical observables decay rapidly, the coarse-grained system is dissipative, and

at nite energy density, the non-abelian gauge eld self-thermalizes on a time scale

2

determined by the inverse of the ks entropy.

2. the long-distance, long-time dynamics of non-abelian gauge theories at nite temper-

ature t is known to reduce to the dynamics of the quasistatic, infrared chromomagnetic

sector of the gauge eld [8]. the scale beyond which this reduction is valid is given by

the quantity (g2t )1 (often called the magnetic length scale), where g is the classical

gauge coupling.1 the magnetic length scale does not depend on h, and the reduction

occurs equally in the classical and quantum mechanical thermal eld theory.

3. the real-time dynamics of the infrared magnetic sector coupled to the short-distance

modes is described by a langevin equation with friction and noise [9,10]. the langevin

equation is equivalent to a fokker-planck equation in the space of three-dimensional

eld congurations.

its stationary solution describes the ground state of a three-

dimensional, euclidean non-abelian quantum gauge eld. this correspondence is also

exploited in the well-established technique of stochastic quantization [11,12].

before we elaborate on these steps further, it is worthwhile considering what the essential

ingredients of our mechanism are. first, the underlying classical eld theory must contain

strongly coupled massless degrees of freedom. such theories are generally chaotic at the

classical level [13]. when observations are restricted to the infrared degrees of freedom, this

corresponds to a coarse graining of the dynamical system, leading to strongly dissipative

long-distance dynamics. the unresolved coupling to the short-distance modes generates

uncorrelated white noise, and the coarse-grained system obeys a dissipation-uctuation the-

orem. it is not yet fully understood whether the dynamics of classical gravity exhibit chaos

in the same sense as above [14,15].

1in our notation here, g is the coupling strength of the classical yang-mills theory. the coupling

constant of the quantum eld theory is gh. with this convention, gha has the dimension of

momentum, while ga has the dimension of an inverse length.

3

second, the eld theory at nite temperature must contain degrees of freedom that re-

main unscreened, i.e., massless. this condition usually requires the presence of a symmetry,

such as gauge invariance. it is not an unreasonable expectation that such symmetries occur

in any classical extension of the theory of general relativity. the condition is also in accor-

dance with the observation that the fundamental quantum elds of the standard model are

bosonic gauge elds and chiral fermion elds.

we now turn to a more detailed examination of our arguments outlined above. the

chaotic nature of classical non-abelian gauge theories in the infrared limit has long been

known [5,16]. numerical studies of spatially varying non-abelian gauge elds on a lattice

have shown that these have positive lyapunov exponents that grow linearly with the energy

density and are independent of the lattice spacing a [1719]. furthermore, the gauge eld

exhibits positive lyapunov exponents for half of those degrees of freedom that do not describe

gauge transformations. the sum of all positive lyapunov exponents, i.e. the ks entropy

hks, scales like the lattice volume (l/a)3 and thus generates a nite ks entropy density. the

ergodic distribution of values for the ks entropy, when evaluated for a nite time duration,

is exactly that expected for a globally hyperbolic dynamical system (anosov system) [7].

the reduction to the long wavelength modes of the gauge eld, made by an observer

who is only able to measure the dynamics of those modes, amounts to a coarse graining

procedure. the chaotic nature of the eld equations implies that the infrared sector of the

non-abelian gauge eld at nite energy density is strongly dissipative and that any generic

initial eld conguration rapidly evolves into a thermalized gauge eld conguration. the

time scale for this process is given by the ratio between entropy growth rate (the ks entropy)
and the equilibrium entropy. at small coupling, g2t  1/a, the energy density  is related
to the temperature t at equilibrium via

 = 2(n 2

c  1)t /a3 + o(g2) ,

where nc is the number of colors. the ks entropy for the su(2) gauge theory scales as

hks  g2t (l/a)3 ,

4

(1)

(2)

and the thermal equilibrium entropy seq  (l/a)3. the time scale for self-equilibration is
therefore given by

eq = seq/hks  (g2t )1 .

(3)

the classical thermal lattice gauge eld theory is characterized by a hierarchy of length
scales [20]: the lattice spacing a, the electric screening length del  (g2t /a)1/2, and the
correlation length of static magnetic elds dmag  (g2t )1. the equilibration time is of
the same order of magnitude as the magnetic distance scale. therefore, when observed at

a space-time scale much larger than dmag the classical gauge eld theory at a nite energy

density has the same physical properties as the thermal gauge eld theory.

note that the distance scales listed above dier from those of the thermal quantum eld

theory. the thermal length scale is h/t and the electric screening length del  h/gt . the

magnetic length scale is the same in the classical and quantum eld theory.

the dynamic properties of thermal non-abelian gauge elds at distances of order dmag

and beyond have recently been investigated intensely, because they are relevant to the rate

of baryon number violation in the high-temperature phase of the standard model [9,10,21].

it is now understood that at such scales the real-time dynamics of the gauge eld, at leading

order, can be described by the langevin equation



a
t

= d  b +  ,

(4)

where d is the gauge covariant spatial derivative, b = d  a is the magnetic eld strength,
and  denotes gaussian distributed white noise with the variance

hi(x, t)j(x, t)i = 2t ij3(x  x)(t  t) .

(5)

here  denotes the color conductivity [22] of the thermal gauge eld which is determined

by the ratio 2

p/ of the plasma frequency p and the damping rate  of a thermal gauge

boson.

at leading logarithmic order in the quantum eld theory,  is given by

5

 

t /h

ln(dmag/del) 

t /h

ln [1/(g2h)]

.

(6)

the derivation of the langevin equation (4) for the classical thermal gauge theory proceeds

completely in parallel to that for the quantum theory, except that the plasma frequency
2
p  g2t /a, and the ratio between the magnetic and electric length scales depends on the
parameter g(t a)1/2 instead of gh1/2. the separation of length scales requires g2t a  1.
the color conductivity then scales as

1

a ln [1/(g2t a)]

.

 

(7)

the analogous form of (6) and (7) suggests an identication of plancks constant h as a

combination of the fundamental length scale a and the temperature t of the four-dimensional

classical eld theory:

h = at.

(8)

we will now show that this is more than just an analogy: an observer restricted to a

three-dimensional world would experience the dynamics of a quantum eld theory with the

coresponding plancks constant h3 determined by the relation (8).

for observers only sensitive to distances and times much larger than 1/(g2t ) any non-

static perturbation of the magnetic sector of the gauge eld dies away rapidly, and observa-

tions yield averages with the equilibrium weight

with

p [a] = ew [a]/t ,

w [a] = z d3x

p [a] is also obtained as the stationary solution of the fokker-planck equation corresponding

to the langevin equation (4):

for an observer conned to three dimensions, the vector bi  ijkf jk encompasses all com-
ponents of the three-dimensional eld strength tensor f ik. one of the spatial coordinates, say

x3, plays the role of the euclidean time variable. w/t is identied as the three-dimensional

action s3 measured in units of plancks constant h3:

where

w/t = s3/h3 ,

(12)

(13)

dimensional reasons require a rescaling of the eld strength with the fundamental length

scale

f ik = af ik.

(14)

together with (10), (12), and (13) this veries the conjecture h3 = at rst stated in (8). fi-

nally, the implied rescaling of the vector potential determines the three-dimensional coupling

(15)

let us summarize. we have shown that a homogeneously excited, classical eld the-

ory in four dimensions can generate a three-dimensional quantum eld theory. whereas

the classical theory appears thermal for a four-dimensional observer, the three-dimensional

observer experiences quantum elds at zero temperature. the essential feature facilitating

this transformation is that the underlying deterministic theory contains a mechanism for

information loss [24], here realized through its chaotic dynamics.

clearly, our example is not directly applicable to the problem of quantum gravity.

t

hooft has speculated that black hole formation may be the mechanism of information loss

operating in the case of general relativity [4]. it is certainly not known at present whether

a similar mechanism as the one described here applies to any higher-dimensional extension

7

of classical general relativity. our example also does not contain fermion elds. it would be

interesting to extend this investigation to supersymmetric theories, some of which have been

shown to exhibit chaos in the infrared limit [23]. another interesting question is whether

the mechanism discussed here is realized in models that allow for a holographic projection,

such as certain anti-de-sitter space theories [25].
