abstract. we show how to use the method of orthogonal poly-
nomials for integrating, in the planar approximation, the partition
function of one-matrix models with a potential with even or odd
vertices, or any combination of them.

1. introduction

the method of orthogonal polynomials is a powerful technique for
the non perturbative integration of matrix models over one [1] or more
matrices [2] in particular with even potential, i.e. with vertices with an
even number of legs. indeed, with even potential, the calculation sim-
plies both because the integrals are well dened and, as we shall see,
the number of equations needed to solve the problem is smaller. on
the other hand the model with odd vertices, in particular with cubic
vertices is more natural in a number of problems; e.g. in the dynamical
triangulation model of quantum gravity, where the random surface is
given by a polyhedron with triangular faces, the order of the vertices
appearing in the dual graphs is always three. brezin et al. [3] solved the
problem with cubic vertices using the saddle point technique. bessis [4]
introduced an alternative method (the orthogonal polynomial method)
which to some extent appears more powerful e.g. in dealing with ma-
trix model with more than one matrix variable [2]. in particular, the
orthogonal polynomial method has been proved useful in the treatment
of a cubic vertex two-matrix model [5] in the context of the ising model
on a random planar lattice.

the purpose of this paper is to show, in a systematic way, how to
extend the orthogonal polynomial method to arbitrary vertices, both
even and odd and any combination of them. we shall follow the article
of bessis et al. [1] generalizing some aspects to the case of odd vertices,
in particular we shall recover, for the simplest case of cubic vertices,
the result of [3] for spherical topology. hopefully such a treatment can
be extended to higher genus.

the use of mixed vertices e.g. cubic plus quartic vertex, allows us to
write a well dened i.e. convergent, partition function by adding to the
cubic interaction a quartic term which makes the action bounded from

below, and thus the integral giving the partition function well dened.
at the end one can take the limit when the coupling constant of the
quartic vertex goes to zero.

we start from the partition function

zn (g) = z dm etrs(m )

(1)

where the integration is over an hermitian matrix of order n and where
the action is given in general by

k

 s(m) = 
xj=3

v (m) =

m 2 + v (m)

(2)

with k even and re(gk) < 0 . (3)

in the following we shall use also the variables gi = gi
2 1 . as we can
see the potential is composed of a combination of vertices, however,
in order it to be bounded from above, and thus the integral be well
dened, it is needed that the vertex with highest valence be even, and
that the real part of the related coupling constant be negative. we are
interested in the functions eh(g)

n

zn (g)
zn (0)

xh=0

n 22heh(g)

(4)

where 2  2h is the euler characteristic of the oriented ribbon graphs
to be summed in the perturbative expansion of the functions eh(g).
indeed, denoting such graphs with capital letters, each function eh
admits the following expansion [1]

eh(g) = xg connected of

genus h

qi gvi(g)

o(a(g))

i

(5)

where vi(g) is the number of vertices with valence i of the ribbon
graph g and o(a(g)) is the order of the group of automorphisms of
the graph 2. figures 2, 2 show the simplest connected ribbon graphs in
the cubic and quartic case. models with odd vertices will be regularized
as explained above i.e. by adding a regulating even interaction which
at the end is put to zero. we shall see explicitly how this method works
for the cubic vertex.

2an automorphism of an oriented ribbon graph is dened in the following way.
first let us identify the oriented ribbon graph as a common graph plus a cyclic
ordering on the sets of half-edges attached to each vertex and then dene an au-
tomorphism of the oriented ribbon graph as an automorphism of the graph which
leaves the ordering of each vertex unchanged.
its clear that the automorphism
must send each vertex into a vertex of equal valence.

2. the method of orthogonal polynomials

a change of integration variables in (1) leads us to the integration

over the eigenvalues i of the diagonal matrix 

zn (g) = z dm etrs(m ) = kh z yi

obtain the value of the constant kh using the results in [6]: kh =

where () = q<(  ) is the vandermonde determinant. we
qj=1 n j!. as we see the argument of the integral is the product of

the vandermonde determinant squared and a factorizable function of
the eigenvalues, this feature makes the orthogonal polynomial method
applicable. let us introduce the measure d() = d es(), and the
orthogonal polynomials pn()

z +



d() pn()pm() = hnnm

(7)

where pn() is normalized by the condition that the coecient of the
term with highest degree equals 1

pn() = n + . . . .

(8)

the polynomials pn() can be obtained in a constructing way e.g. by
the gram-schmidt orthogonalization procedure from the monomials 1,
, 2, . . . . a simple analysis of this procedure shows that the polyno-
mials pj have the well dened parity (1)j if the action s() is even.
every polynomial of degree n can be rewritten as a linear combina-
tion of pm with m  n. the vandermonde determinant in (6) can be
rewritten as

 = det k j1

i

k= det k pj1(i) k= x

(1)p()

n

yi

p(i)1(i)

(9)

where the second equality is due to the fact that adding to a column a
linear combination of the other columns does not change the determi-
nant of the matrix; (1)p() stands for the sign of the permutation .
we can take advantage of the coupling of the orthogonal polynomials
due 2 in (6) to obtain the partition function in terms of the norm of
the orthogonal polynomials

zn (g) = kh x1, 2

orthogonal polynomial method and odd vertices

let us rewrite this expression in a dierent form. the following equa-
tion is valid

pn() = pn+1() + anp () + rnpn1()

(11)
where the terms with index less than n  1 are absent because after
moltiplication by  they do not reach the degree n and thus are orthog-
onal to pn. for parity reasons when s() is even an vanishes. we
shall refer to the preceding equation as the step equation because its
repeated application enables us to calculate ipn() using an analogy
with all possible staircases i steps long. this method will be developed
in the following section. since

hn+1 = z d() pn+1pn()

(12)

= z d() [pn+2() +an+1pn+1() +rn+1pn()]pn() = rn+1hn

the partition function can be rewritten as

zn (g) = khn! hn

0 rn 1

1

. . . r2

n 2rn 1

(13)

where h0 = r des(). before passing to the limit for large n, we

must compute

en (g) =

h0(g)
h0(0)

. (14)

we can prove that the last term on the r.h.s. of (14) is negligible using
the same perturbative method used for the partition function. the
main dierence is that h0(g) is integrated over a scalar variable whereas
partition functions such as zn (g) are integrated over a matrix variable.
expanding the action in h0 and recalling the proof of the topological
expansion [1], we notice the absence of the typical contribution due to
the propagator deltas, namely a factor n for each face. finally we have
to add a factor n f which yields

ln

h0(g)
h0(0)

since (g)  f = pi=3 vi( i

3. the number of staircases

we shall need, in the following, the quantities i

n dened by

hni

n = z d() pn()ipn1() .

(18)

we devote the present section to the calculation of the above integral.
to compute ipn1 we take advantage of an analogy with all staircases
of i steps; where each step can go up, come down, or stay at the
same level. the analogy comes from a repeated application of the step
equation. after the integration only the staircases which end one step
up, contribute. each of them represents a product of factors: if a step
is down from level n to the level n1 we add a factor rn, and if it stays
at the same level n we add a factor an. figure 3 shows an example of
this kind of calculation. since every coecient aj, rj, is a function

figure 3. i

n computed from the staircases.

of the index j it would be dicult to hand the nal expression for i
n;
luckily, as we shall see, the planar limit ( n   ) will enable us
to neglect the dierences among these quantities relative to dierent
levels. in this limit we must compute the expression for i
n supposing
that each step down yields a factor r, and each step that stays at the
same level yields a factor a. thus the question is: how many are the
staircases of i steps whose nal eect is to go up one step? let j be
the steps of type a, then the other i  j are divided in p steps up and
p  1 steps down so that i = j + 2p  1. without the a steps there
are (cid:0)2p1
p (cid:1) staircases of 2p  1 steps whose nal eect is to go up one
step. inside these staircases we want to insert the remaining j levels of
type a: there are 2p places where they can be inserted, and, for a xed
staircase, there are (cid:0)2p+j1
(cid:1) choices. finally the number of staircases

j

of i steps whose nal eect is to go up one step is

[ i+1

xp=1

i!

(i  2p + 1)!p!(p  1)!

,

(19)

where [ ] stands for the integer part, and, denoting by i the continuum
value of i

n, we have

i =

[ i+1

xp=1

i!

(i  2p + 1)!p!(p  1)!

ai2p+1rp1

(20)

where the tilde reminds the replacement aj  a, rj  r. the values
of i for the rst few i are

2 = 2a
3 = 3a2 + 3r
4 = 4a3 + 12ar .

analogously we dene

hn+1i

n = z d() pn+1()ipn1() .

by the same technique used for i

n we nd

(22)

i =

[ i

xp=2

i!

(i  2p + 2)!p!(p  2)!

ai2p+2rp2 .

(23)

finally we dene

i = i ri1 a i1 =

[ i+1

xp=1

(i  1)!

(i  2p + 1)! (p  1)!2 ai2p+1rp1 .

(24)

the values of i for the rst few i are

3 = a2 + 2r
4 = a3 + 6ar
5 = a4 + 12a2r + 6r2 .

(25)

4. derivation of the continuum equations

in this section we shall examine the continuum limit n  , which
will allow us to write a simple expression for the generating function

orthogonal polynomial method and odd vertices

e2(g) of the planar graphs. this will also justify the replacement aj 
a, rj  r used in the previous section. let us consider the identity

n() [pn+1() + rnpn1() + anpn()]

n()pn()

nhn = z d() p 
= z d() p 
= rnz d es()p 
= rnz d es()s ()pn()pn1()

n()pn1()

(26)

= (1 

k

xi=3

gii1

n ) hn rn ,

where in the last but one equality we have integrated by parts and
in the last equality we have used the denition of i
n. thus we have
obtained the rst recursion relation

n = (1 

k

xi=3

gii1

n ) rn .

(27)

from this equation we infer in particular that: rn(0) = n. we want to
nd a second recursion relation which relates the coecients an and
rn. we observe that:

z d es()pn()p 

n+1() = z d es()pn()s ()pn+1()

= (an + an+1 

k

xi=3

gii

n+1) hn+1 .

(28)

but

z d es()pn()p 

n+1() = nanhn + rnz d es()pn1()p 

n+1()

= nanhn + rnz d es()pn1()s ()pn+1()

= nanhn  hn+1rn

k

xi=3

gii1

n

.

(29)

as a result, the second recursion relation is

(an + an+1 

k

xi=3

gii

n+1) rn+1 = nan  rn+1rn

k

xi=3

gii1

n

.

(30)

10

orthogonal polynomial method and odd vertices

now, we extract the planar case taking the limit n  . let us
introduce the substitutions

n
n  x
rn
n  r(x)
ann  a(x)

(31)

(32)

(33)

to obtain, taking into account the power of n contained in gi, the two
continuum equations

k

x = r(x)(cid:16)1 

xi=3
gi i(x) ,

gi i1(x)(cid:17)

(34)

(35)

a(x) =

k

xi=3

where i(x) and i(x) are expressed in terms of a(x) and r(x) as given
by eqs. (20, 24). one nds, from eqs. (27, 30), that the continuous
solution a(x), r(x), is related to the coecients an and rn by

rn
n

ann

= r(cid:16) n
= a(cid:16) n

n(cid:17) + o(cid:0)n 1(cid:1)
n(cid:17) + o(cid:0)n 1(cid:1) .

(36)

we are interested only in the continuous solution, indeed, recalling that
rn(0) = n, we have

rn(g)
rn(0)

=

rn(g)

n (cid:16) n

n(cid:17)1

,

and the function e0(g) can be rewritten, in the limit n  , as

e0(g) = z 1

0

dx (1  x) ln(cid:18)r(x)

x (cid:19) .

(37)

(38)

we have therefore reduced our problem to the one of obtaining r(x)
(or a(x)) from the system of continuum equations (34, 35), and to
perform the integral in eq. (38).

5. the solution for the cubic vertex

in order to understand the solution for the cubic vertex it is useful
to recall the main features of the even vertex case. for even vertex
a(x) = 0 and thus the rst continuum equation for r(x),

x = r(cid:16)1 

k/2

xp=2

g2p(cid:18)2p  1

p (cid:19) rp1(cid:17)

(39)

suces. the quartic case can be explicitly integrated [1] to obtain

e0(g4) =

1
2

ln a +

1
24

(a  1)(a  9) =



xk=1

6g4

a =

xk=1

(3g4)k 2

(2k  1)!

(k + 1)!(k  1)!

.

(41)

recalling the formula for the topological expansion (5), one has the
interesting equation

xg planar, connected,

with k quartic vertices

1

o(a(g))

= 3k (2k  1)!
k! (k + 2)!

(42)

that can be checked for k = 1 and k = 2 using the contents of gure 2.
the radius of convergence is 1/12 and g4c = 1/12 is the critical point.
for g4  g4c one obtains the critical behavior
2 ,

(43)

5

e0(g4)  (g4c  g4)

which is particularly interesting for 2d-gravity.

coming now to the cubic vertex case, in order to cure the lower
unboundedness of the action, one can add a quartic term with negative
g4, with the idea to take eventually the limit g4  0. on the other
hand it is clear that we can just take g4 = 0 in all the expressions which
turn out to be well dened in that limit. we shall see that the integral
(38) is well dened for r(x) given by the solution of the continuum
equations (34, 35) with g4 = 0

x
r

= 1  2g3a
2g3r = a  g3a2 .

(44)

in fact, let us introduce the new variable  = g3 a related to x by
(45)

3 x + (1 + )(1 + 2) = 0 .

2g2

the function (x) = (g2
3 x) is the solution of (45) which vanishes for
x = 0; indeed when g3 = 0 the potential has no longer odd vertices
and then a(x) = 0  (0) = 0. our function e0(g3) may be rewritten,
going over from the variable x to the variable  and integrating by
parts

e0(g3) = z 1

where 1 = (g2

3) is the solution of

2g2

3 + (1 + )(1 + 2) = 0 ,

which vanishes in g3 = 0. 1 can be expressed as an expansion in
powers of g3 using lagrange theorem, obtaining

2(k + 1)(cid:1)

.

(48)

except for some factors, due to dierent denitions, our results coincide
with those of brezin et al. [3]. the power expansion series for the planar
generating function is

e0(g3) =

xk=1

(8g2

3)k

(3k/2)

(k + 3) (k/2 + 1)

(49)

and, recalling the topological expansion for e0(g3), we reach the formula

xg planar, connected,

with 2k cubic vertices

1

o(a(g))

= 8k 1
2

(3k/2)

(k + 3) (k/2 + 1)

.

(50)

such formula can be checked for k = 1 and k = 2 using the contents of
gure 2. the asymptotic behavior of the expansion coecient is

8k 1
2

(3k/2)

(k + 2) (k/2 + 1)

2 .

(51)

the radius of convergence of the series is 1/p123 and g3c =
1/p123 is the critical point. from the asymptotic behavior k

we conclude that the critical exponent remains unchanged from the
quartic case.

2

in 2d-gravity, where the continuum surfaces are replaced by poligo-
nalizations, such a result is a check of the independence of the partition
function, in the limit of innite number of vertices, of the kind of polig-
onalization one chooses to approximate the continuum surfaces [7].

6. conclusions

in dealing with matrix models usually one encounters matrix models
with even potential so the question naturally arises if there is some
obstruction to the odd vertex case. in this paper we have shown that,
even if, in the odd vertex case, the original partition function is ill
dened, the method of orthogonal polynomials can be often applied in
its most naive form, that is ignoring all convergence problems. this is
justied by adding a regulating even vertex to the odd one, and taking
eventually the limit for its coupling constant going to zero. we have
extended the orthogonal polynomial method to any combination of odd
and even vertices, writing the two needed continuum equation. the
explicit application to the cubic vertex case has been given, recovering

orthogonal polynomial method and odd vertices

13

the result of brezin et al. [3]. an explicit integration of 3+4 or 5 vertex
case appears feasible along these lines and would be a useful check of
the universality of the critical behavior.

the general setting explained here can be readily developed, in the
planar case, also for two-matrix models with coupling in the form of
the itzykson-zuber formula [8, 2], the cubic case being already solved
in [5]. further extension can be developed in higher genus cases e.g.
in the cubic case for the torus topology.
