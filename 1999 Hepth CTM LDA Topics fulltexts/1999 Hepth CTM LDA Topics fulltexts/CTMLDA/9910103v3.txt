abstract

we introduce a spectral approach to non-perturbative eld theory
within the periodic eld formalism. as an example we calculate the real
and imaginary parts of the propagator in 1 + 1 dimensional 4 theory,
identifying both one-particle and multi-particle contributions. we dis-
cuss the computational limits of existing diagonalization algorithms and
suggest new quasi-sparse eigenvector methods to handle very large fock
spaces and higher dimensional eld theories.

1 introduction

modal expansion methods have recently been used to study non-perturbative
phenomena in quantum eld theory [1]-[3]. modal eld theory, the name for
the general procedure, consists of two main parts. the rst is to approximate
eld theory as a nite-dimensional quantum mechanical system. the second
is to analyze the properties of the reduced system using one of several com-
putational techniques. the quantum mechanical approximation is generated
by decomposing eld congurations into free wave modes. this technique has
been explored using both spherical partial waves (spherical eld theory [1][2])
and periodic box modes (periodic eld theory [3]).

having reduced eld theory to a more tractable quantum mechanical sys-
tem, we have several dierent ways to proceed. boson interactions in euclidean
space, for example, can be modeled using the method of diusion monte carlo.
in many situations, however, monte carlo techniques are inadequate. these
include unquenched fermion systems, processes in minkowski space, and the
phenomenology of multi-particle states. diculties arise when the functional

integral measure cannot be treated as a probability distribution or when in-
formation must be extracted from excited states obscured by dominant lower
lying states. fortunately there are several alternative methods in the modal
eld formalism which avoid these problems. matrix runge-kutta techniques
were introduced in [2] as a method for calculating unquenched fermion interac-
tions. here we discuss a dierent approach, one which directly calculates the
spectrum and eigenstates of the hamiltonian. for this approach it is essen-
tial that the hamiltonian is time-independent, and so we will consider periodic
rather than spherical eld theory. as we demonstrate, these methods naturally
accommodate the study of multi-particle states and minkowskian dynamics.

we apply the spectral approach to 1 + 1 dimensional 4 theory in a periodic
box and calculate the real and imaginary parts of the  propagator. some in-
teresting properties of 4
2 theory such as the phase transition at large coupling
were already discussed within the modal eld formalism using euclidean monte
carlo techniques [3]. the purpose of this analysis is of a more general and
exploratory nature. our aim is to test the viability of modal diagonalization
techniques for quantum eld hamiltonians. we would like to know whether
we can clearly see multi-particle phenomena, the size of the errors and com-
putational limitations with current computer resources, and how such methods
might be extended to more complicated higher dimensional eld theories.

the spectral method presented in the rst part of our analysis is similar
to the work of brooks and frautschi [4],1 who considered a 1 + 1 dimensional
yukawa model in a periodic box and deserves credit for the rst application of
diagonalization techniques using plane wave modes in a periodic box. our cal-
culations are also similar in spirit to diagonalization-based hamiltonian lattice
formulations [5] and tamm-danco light-cone and discrete light-cone quanti-
zation [6]-[8]. there are, however, some dierences which we should mention.
as in [4] we are using a momentum lattice rather than a spatial lattice. we
nd this convenient to separate out invariant subspaces according to total mo-
mentum quantum numbers. since we are using an equal time formulation our
eigenvectors are not boost invariant as they would be on the light cone. also we
are using a simple momentum cuto scheme rather than a regularization scheme
which includes tamm-danco fock-space truncation. as a result our renor-
malization procedure is relatively straightforward, but we will have to confront
the problem of diagonalizing large fock spaces from the very beginning.
in the
latter part of the paper we mention current work on quasi-sparse eigenvector
methods which can handle even exceptionally large fock spaces. despite the
dierences among the various diagonalization approaches to eld theory, the
issues and problems discussed in our analysis are of a general nature. we hope
that the ideas presented here will be of use for the various dierent approaches.

2 spectral method

the eld conguration  in 1 + 1 dimensions is subject to periodic boundary
conditions (t, x l) = (t, x + l). expanding in terms of periodic box modes,
we have

(t, x) = q 1

2l xn=0,1,...

n(t)einx/l.

(1)

the sum over momentum modes is regulated by choosing some large positive
number nmax and throwing out all high-momentum modes n such that |n| >
nmax. in this theory renormalization can be implemented by normal ordering
the 4 interaction term. after a straightforward calculation (details are given
in [3]), we nd that the counterterm hamiltonian has the form

we represent the canonical conjugate pair n and dn

we now consider the hilbert space of our quantum mechanical system.

given d, an array of non-negative integers,

d = {dnmax , dnmax} ,

we denote pd(q) as the following monomial with total degree |d|,

pd(q) =

yn=nmax,nmax

dn = |d| .

we dene g(q) to be a gaussian of the form2

function (q) can be written as a superposition

(q) = xd

cd pd(q)g (q).

(8)

in this analysis we consider only the zero-momentum subspace. we impose this
constraint by restricting the sum in (8) to monomials satisfying

ndn = 0.

xn

(9)

we will restrict the space of functions (q) further by removing high energy

states in the following manner. let

k(d) = xn

|n| dn.

(10)

k(d) was rst introduced in [2] and provides an estimate of the kinetic energy as-
sociated with a given state. let us dene two auxiliary cuto parameters, kmax
and dmax. we restrict the sum in (8) to monomials such that k(d) < kmax
and |d|  dmax. we will refer to the corresponding subspace as vkmax,dmax .
the cuto kmax removes states with high kinetic energy and the cuto dmax
eliminates states with a large number of excited modes.3 we should stress that
kmax and dmax are only auxiliary cutos. we increase these parameters until
in
the physical results appear close to the asymptotic limit kmax, dmax  .
our scheme ultraviolet regularization is provided only by the momentum cuto
parameter nmax.

our plan is to analyze the spectrum and eigenstates of h restricted to this
approximate low energy subspace, vkmax,dmax . for any xed l and nmax, h is
the hamiltonian for a nite-dimensional quantum mechanical system and the
results should converge in the limit kmax, dmax  . we obtain the desired
eld theory result by then taking the limit l, nmax

l  .

3 results

we have calculated the matrix elements of h restricted to vkmax,dmax using a
symbolic dierentiation-integration algorithm4 and diagonalized h, obtaining
both eigenvalues and eigenstates. let  be the full propagator,

(p2) = iz d2x eip x

h0| t [(x)(0)] |0i .

(11)

3in the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the broken symmetry of the vacuum may
require retaining a large number of q0 modes. this however is remedied by shifting the
variable, q

0 = q0  h0| q0 |0i.

we have computed  by inserting our complete set of eigenstates (complete in
vkmax,dmax). let mp be the multi-particle contribution to ,

mp(p2) = (p2)  pole(p2),

(12)

where pole is the single-particle pole contribution. we are primarily interested
in mp, a quantity that cannot be obtained for p2 > 0 using monte carlo
methods. since the imaginary part of pole is a delta function, it is easy to
distinguish the single-particle and multi-particle contributions in a plot of the
imaginary part of . the real part of , however, is dominated by the one-
particle pole. for this reason we have chosen to plot the real part of mp rather
than that of .

although we have referred to multi-particle states, it should be noted that
in our nite periodic box there are no true continuum multi-particle states.
instead we nd densely packed discrete spectra with level separation of size 
l1 which become continuum states in the limit l  . we can approximate
the contribution of these l   continuum states by a simple smoothing
process. we included a small width   l1 to each of the would-be continuum
states and averaged over a range of values for l. for the results we report here
we have averaged over values l = 2.0, 2.1, 2.8. for convenience all units
have been scaled such that  = 1.
the parameter  was adjusted to reduce the errors due to the nite cuto
values kmax and dmax.
since the spectrum of h is bounded below, errors
due to nite kmax and dmax generally drive the estimated eigenvalues higher.
one strategy, therefore, is to optimize  by minimizing the trace of h restricted
to the subspace vkmax,dmax . the approach used here is a slight variation
of this  we have minimized the trace of h restricted to a smaller subspace
max  vkmax,dmax . the aim is to accelerate the convergence of the
vk 
lowest energy states rather than the entire space vkmax,dmax . throughout our
analysis we used k 

max,d

max, d

max = 8, 3.

for 

4! = 0.50 we have plotted the imaginary part of  in figure 1 and the
real part of mp in figure 2. the value 
4! = 0.50 is above the threshold for
reliable perturbative approximation5 ( 
4! . 0.25) but below the critical value at
which    symmetry breaks spontaneously ( 
4!  2.5). the contribution of
the one-particle state appears near p2 = (0.93)2 and the three-particle threshold
is at approximately p2 = (2.9)2. we have chosen several dierent values for
nmax, kmax, dmax to show the convergence as these parameters become large.
the plot for nmax, kmax, dmax = 9, 19, 7 appears relatively close to the asymp-
totic limit. the somewhat bumpy texture of the curves is due to the nite size
of our periodic box and diminishes with increasing l. from dimensional power
counting, we expect errors for nite nmax to scale as n 2
max. assuming that
kmax and dmax also function as uniform energy cutos, we expect a similar
error dependence  and it appears plausible from the results in figures 1 and 2.
a more systematic analysis of the errors and extrapolation methods for nite
nmax, kmax, dmax, and l, will be discussed in future work.

in figures 3 and 4 we have compared our spectral calculations with the
two-loop perturbative result for 
4! = 0.01. we have used nmax, kmax, dmax =
9, 19, 7, and the agreement appears good. for small 
4! the propagator has a
very prominent logarithmic cusp at the three-particle threshold, which can be
seen clearly in figures 3 and 4.

in figures 5 and 6 we have compared results for 

4! = 0.25, 0.50, 1.00. we
have again used nmax, kmax, dmax = 9, 19, 7.
in contrast with the quadratic
scaling in the perturbative regime, the results here scale approximately linearly
with 
4! . an interesting and perhaps related observation is that the magnitude
of the multi-particle contribution to  remains small (. 0.003) even for the
rather large coupling value 

4! = 1.00.

4 limitations and new ideas

we now address the computational limits of the diagonalization techniques pre-
sented in this work. these techniques are rather straightforward and can in
principle be generalized to any eld theory. in practise however the fock space
vkmax,dmax becomes prohibitively large, especially for higher dimensional theo-
ries. the data in figures 1 and 2 and crosschecks with euclidean monte carlo
results6 suggest that for nmax = 9 and l = 2.0, 2.8 our spectral results
with kmax, dmax = 19, 7 and 
4! < 1 are within 20% of the kmax, dmax  
in this case vkmax,dmax is a 2036 dimensional space and requires about
limit.
100 mb of ram using general (dense) matrix methods.

sparse matrix techniques such as the lanczos or arnoldi schemes allow us
to push the dimension of the fock space to about 105 states. this may be
sucient to do accurate calculations near the critical point 
4!  2.5 for larger
values of l and nmax. it is, however, near the upper limit of what is possible
using current computer technology and existing algorithms. unfortunately
eld theories in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions will require much larger fock spaces,
probably at least 1012 and 1018 states respectively.
in order to tackle these
larger fock spaces it is necessary to venture beyond standard diagonalization
approaches. the problem of large fock spaces (106 states) is beyond the
intended scope of this analysis. but since it is of central importance to the
diagonalization approach to eld theory we would like to briey comment on
current work being done which may resolve many of the diculties. the new
approach takes advantage of the sparsity of the fock-space hamiltonian and the
approximate (quasi-)sparsity of the eigenvectors. a detailed description will be
provided in a future publication [9].

we start with some observations about the eigenvectors of the 4

1+1 hamil-
tonian for nmax = 9, l = 2.5 and kmax, dmax = 19, 7. to make certain that
we are probing non-perturbative physics we will set 
4! = 2.5, the approximate
critical point value. we label the normalized eigenvectors as |v0i, |v1i, ,
ascending in order with respect to energy. we also dene |b0i, |b1i, as the

despite the non-perturbative coupling and complex phenomena associated with
the phase transition, we see from the table that each of the eigenvectors can be
approximated by just a small number of its largest fock-space components. we
recall that the fock space for this system has 2036 dimensions. the eigenvec-
tors are therefore quasi-sparse in this space, a consequence of the sparsity of
the hamiltonian.
if we write the hamiltonian as a matrix in the free fock-
space basis, a typical row or column contains only about 200 non-zero entries,
a number we refer to as ntransition.
in [9] we show that a typical eigenvector
will be dominated by the largest ntransition elements.7 the key point is that
ntransition is quite manageable  on the order of 103 and 105 for 2 + 1 and
3+1 dimensional eld theories respectively. although the size of the fock space
for these systems are enormous, the extreme sparsity of the hamiltonian sug-
gests that the eigenvectors can be approximated using current computational
resources.

with this simplication, the task is to nd the important basis states for
a given eigenvector. since the important basis states for one eigenvector are
generally dierent from that of another, each eigenvector is determined indepen-
dently. this provides a starting point for parallelization, and many eigenvectors
can be determined at the same time using massively parallel computers.
in [9]
we present a simple stochastic algorithm where the exact eigenvectors act as
stable xed points of the update process.

7there are some special exceptions to this rule and they are discussed in [9]. but these

are typically not relevant for the lower energy eigenstates of a quantum eld hamiltonian.

5 summary

we have introduced a spectral approach to periodic eld theory and used it
to calculate the propagator in 1 + 1 dimensional 4 theory. we nd that the
straightforward application of these methods with existing computer technology
can be useful for describing the multi-particle properties of the theory, infor-
mation dicult to obtain using euclidean monte carlo methods. however
the extension to higher dimensional theories is made dicult by the large size
of the corresponding fock space. as a possible solution to this problem, we
note that each eigenvector of the 4
1+1 hamiltonian can be well-approximated
using relatively few components and discuss some current work on quasi-sparse
eigenvector methods.
