abstract

we study the generic p  p system in the presence of constant ns 2-form bij eld.
we derive properties concerning with the noncommutativity of d-brane worldvolume,
the green functions and the spectrum of this system. in the zero slope limit, a large
number of light states appear as the lowest excitations in appropriate cases. we are
able to relate the energies of the lowest states after the gso projection with the con-
gurations of branes at angles. through analytic continuation, the system is compared
with the branes with relative motion.

introduction

there are several reasons to expect that noncommutative geometry may play a pivotal
role in the developments of string theory. the developments which have already taken
place include an eective worldvolume description of d-branes in terms of noncommuting
coordinates [1]. one may mention the recent proposal by connes, douglas and schwarz that,
in the small volume limit, the compactication of matrix theory on a torus with background
cij should be described by noncommutative yang-mills theory on the dual torus [2, 3].
the t-duality in string theory is found to have a counterpart in noncommutative geometry
called morita equivalence [4]. much work has been done, following these developments. (see
[5] for references.) let us mention here the work on instantons on noncommutative space.
in order to remove the singularities of the instanton moduli space, one needs to introduce a
nonvanishing parameter in the adhm construction of instantons [6]. nekrasov and schwarz
noticed that the adhm construction of instantons on noncommutative space recovers this
modication so that the smooth moduli of the instantons are the moduli space of instanton
on noncommutative space[7].

these ideas have recently been extended by seiberg and witten [5]. noncommutativity
of d-brane worldvolumes has been shown to emerge from the open string green function
in the presence of constant rank-two antisymmetric background eld bij. in fact, at the
boundaries of an open string, the two-point green function is

dxi( )xj( )e = gij log(   )2 +

i
2

ij(   ) ,

(1.1)

where  | z |, gij is an open string metric and ij is a noncommutative parameter measured
by

[xi( ), xj( )] = iij

.

(1.2)

as mentioned above, the d-brane worldvolume is a noncommutative space. in the zero slope
limit   0 while keeping the open string metric gij and the noncommutative parameter
ij nite, the operator product becomes a  product of noncommutative geometry, which is
associative and translationally invariant. properties of the d-branes can be described by an
eective action on the noncommutative space. several other topics have been investigated
in [5].

in the d0-d4 system with bij background, in particular, it has been found that a large
number of light states emerge when p f (b) < 0. in the zero-slope limit, the system can be
eectively considered as the conguration in which there is a continuous distribution of d0s
in the d4 worldvolume. the properties of the system can then be treated as those of d0-d0
pairs. the existence of a large number of light states could be interpreted as uctuations of

2

the one end point of the open string stretching between two d0s, keeping the other end xed.
as the d0-d4 system without bij eld can be understood in terms of small instantons [8, 9],
the low lying d0-d4 excitation spectrum with bij should correspond to small uctuations
around point-like instantons. but now the instantons live in noncommutative r4.

in this paper, we consider the generic p-p system in the presence of b eld. in the next
section, we will derive the value of the parameter  which measures noncommutativity, the
green function and the excitation spectrum. in [5], it has been shown that in the presence
of constant bij the d-brane worldvolume should be noncommutative. the analysis is based
on the open string green function in the background [14]. the end point of the open string
probes the worldvolume structure of d-brane. this suggests that we may investigate the
dp worldvolume via dp-dp open string. we nd that although the open string green
function is quite dierent from the one in eq.(1.1) where only dp-branes are considered,
the noncommutative structure is the same. our calculation gives a consistency check of the
in dp-dp system, we can study the space structure either with dp-dp open
formalism:
string or with dp-dp open string. the two approach should give the same answer. this
might indicate the existence of a universal description of the noncommutativity of dp-brane
worldvolumes rather than the one by the open string. we nd that a number of light states
emerge in the zero slope limit in some appropriate cases. since the d0-d2 system in the
presence of the b eld can be used as a building block of the green functions and the
description of the states in terms of the modes, we will discuss this case in some detail.

another theme on the p-p system with constant b eld which we observe is its equivalence
to the system of two d-branes at angles after t-duality. congurations of d-branes at
angles have been studied in [10, 11]. it has been noticed that in general such congurations
break all of the supersymmetries and only for some special congurations a fraction of them
survives. one such example is two d2 branes intersecting at right angles. via t-duality, it is
related to the d0-d4 system. we provide appropriate identications between  s in the p-p
system originated from the canonical form of b and angles in the t-dualized system, paying
attention to the gso projection and bps conguration.
it is found that the energies of
the ground state after the gso projection and the lowest excitations in the p-p system are
closely related to the condition for supersymmetry in the system of branes at angles. the
above identications measure how far the system is from a bps conguration. in the dual
picture, the light states correspond to the small uctuations around the bps conguration.
for example, in the case of d0-d4, under our identication, the energies of the lowest gso
states are proportional to 1 + 2. when p f (b) < 0, the t-dualized picture is a d2 almost
parallel to another d2, in the   0 limit, and a large number of light states appear.
and when p f (b) > 0, the t-dualized picture is two almost anti-parallel d2 branes. the
tachyon appears as the lowest state and has energy proportional to . there are no light

3

states in the limit of   0. the value of 1 + 2 tells us whether we are near or far from
a bps conguration. in fact, even without taking the zero slope limit, we can know from
the dual picture in which case our p-p system keeps a fraction of supersymmetries. in the
case of d0-d4, as long as b12 = b34, the identication leads to 1 + 2 = 0, which is the
condition for supersymmetry in the case of two d2 branes at angles, so that our system is
bps although the worldvolume of d4 now is noncommutative. in the case d0-d4 with bij,
the bps condition requires that b12 = b34. the careful treatment of the generic d0-dp
(p = 2, 4, 6, 8) system will be discussed in section iii.

in section iv, we compare our p-p system with bij background with two d-branes with
relative motion. the dynamics of d-branes with relative motion has also been noted for
some time [15, 16].
it has been related to an open string pair production in a constant
electric background [17]. therefore, for generic b background, the p-p system can be
treated either as the two d-branes with relative motion or as those with relative orientation
depending upon whether the time direction is included or not.

the one-loop vacuum amplitude has been evaluated. the dependence on  tells us in
which case we have a nearly supersymmetric conguration. the eect of b can be seen
from the investigation of either motion d-branes or d-branes at angles. this means the
dynamics of d-branes come from the introduction of b eld.

ii.

p-p system with bij field

in [5], it has been shown that two dp-branes in the presence of constant bij eld can still
preserve one-half of the supersymmetries and the excitations from an open string between
the two dp-branes are unchanged. the only eect of b eld is to make its worldvolume
noncommutative. in order to describe the d-brane worldvolume geometry, it is expedient to
introduce the parameter ij which measures noncommutativity and the open string metric
gij. in the zero-slope limit, the tower of string excitations are projected out and we obtain
an eective description in terms of nite  and g. the low energy eective action of the
dp-brane is super-yang-mills theory dened on a noncommutative space [5].

in the case of p-p system, we nd that supersymmetry can not be kept generically and

4

tachyons are ubiquitous. as bij can be set to its canonical form

we can reduce the problems of the mode expansions and the green functions in the p-p
system to those in the d0-d2 system. let us focus on this case for a while.

we take the d2 worldvolume to extend in the x0, x1, x2 directions. we dene z  x1+ix2.

the boundary conditions on the d0-d2 bosonic open strings z and z are

 z|=0 = z + b z|= = 0 ,

 z|=0 = z  b z|= = 0 .

the mode expansion of z and that of z satisfying the above boundary conditions are

in the current notation. (notice the minus sign of the right hand of eq. (2.7) ). we have
two groups of creation operators, the one consisting of n+ with n  0 and the other of
m+ with m < 0. we will nd that the excitation energies are dierent between these two
groups.

the virasoro generators of the z-z system are given by

from the eigenvalues of l0 action, we can read o the excitation energies. the two lowest
excitations are  with its energy  and 1+ with its energy 1  . which one is the
lowest depends on whether  is bigger or smaller than one-half, or equivalently on whether
b is positive or negative.

we have the d0-d2 open string with one end on the d0 brane and the other on the
d2 brane. to evaluate the parameter  which measures the noncommutativity on the d2
worldvolume, let us nd the commutator between z and z at the d2 endpoint. this leads
us to calculate the two-point function between z and z. from the mode expansion eq. (2.4),
we nd

(2.16)

eq. (2.14) and eq. (2.16) agree. the green function of the dp-dp system and that of the
d0-d2 system have the same noncommutativity.

the open string metric gij on the d2 worldvolume can be extracted from the green

function evaluated at the end point  = . we nd

h0|z(z)z(z)|0i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=

eq. (2.19) can be compared with eq. (2.5) in [5]:

where ( )s denotes the symmetric part of the matrix. from eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) we obtain

g11 = g22 =

.

(2.21)

comparing this with the prefactor of the logarithm in eq. (2.19), we nd that the open string
metric obtained in our system is exactly the same3 as that in [5].

we conclude that the noncommutativity of the worldvolumes of the d-branes and the

open string metric can both be probed, using the generic p-p system.

let us now turn to the worldsheet fermions in the nsr formalism. first, dene

 = 1 + i2 ,

 = 1  i2,

 = 1 + i 2,

 = 1  i 2 .

(2.22)

(2.23)

the boundary conditions for the worldsheet fermions can be determined by demanding the
worldsheet supersymmetry. we nd that, in the ramond sector, the worldsheet fermions
obey

 + |=0 = (  )  ib( + )|= = 0 ,

 + |=0 = (   ) + ib(  + )|= = 0 .

the mode expansion on the upper half plane is

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

the total ground state energy vanishes in the ramond sector due to the cancellation be-
tween bosons and fermions. as in the bosonic case, the excitations come from two types of
oscillators d and d, and the two lowest ones have energy e =  and e = 1   respectively.

in the ns sector, the boundary conditions change to

 + |=0 = ( + )  ib(  )|= = 0 ,

 + |=0 = (  + ) + ib(   )|= = 0 .

due to the gso projection, only one of these two states survive. we determine which state
we should project out in the following way. as we will disscuss later, d0-branes are induced
on the d2-brane worldvolume in the zero-slope limit [5]. when p f (b) < 0, we identify them
with d0s not d0s, following the argument in [5]. using this denition of the d0-brane, we
take the gso projection so that the system becomes d0-d2 not d0-d2. in the other cases
which we will investigate in the following, we will take the gso projection in the same
manner.

by denition, e  is chosen as the ground state after the gso projection while e+ is left
out in the entire region of  :
0   < 1. we can restate this by saying that, when b is
negative, we keep e1 and leave e0 out and that, when b is positive, we keep e0 and leave
e1 out. from this latter point of view, it can be said that, in the two regimes of , the gso
projections are opposite. we will see that the pattern of classication of states seen in eq.
(2.37) will hold in the generic p-p system.

for small positive b,

(2.38)

and we have a tachyonic state after the gso projection. for small negative b, we have

the ground state is projected out and the part of the remaining rst excitations is still
tachyonic.

we are, however, more interested in the situation in the zero slope limit, i .e. |b|  
limit. we would like to know if some light states survive. this is in parallel to the discussion
of d0-d4 system in [5]. we will see that a large number of light states appear for b negative.

as b  +, the ground state energy becomes

e0  

1

2 (cid:18)1 

1

b(cid:19) ,

(2.40)

being of order 1. clearly this is tachyonic and is the same order as the energy of the tachyon
in the d0-d0 system. in the language of [5], the large positive b induces a large number of
d0s in the d2, and the d0 can annihilate one of these d0s. all of the one-particle excitations
are projected out and the lowest two-particle excitation has energy

e = e0 + 1 =

1

2 (cid:18)1 

1

b(cid:19) ,

(2.41)

which is positive, and also of order 1. this state cannot become light in the zero-slope limit.
we conclude that our system has no light state for b positive.

for b  , we have a dierent story. the rst two one-particle excitations have

energies

e1 

1
2b

, e2  

3
2b

,

(2.42)

and their mass squared are nite as   0. apart from these two light states, we obtain
eight more states by acting on |0i with the creation operators which carry the lowest energy
1
2 and which are obtained from the ns fermion partners of x0,3,,9. these states have energies

ei  

1
2b

,

(2.43)

surviving the   0 limit. we can further act on these states with an arbitrary polynomial
consisting of  with its energy  =  1
b . this also leads to a nite energy state in the
zero-slope limit. we conclude that, for b negative, we have a large number of light states in
the   0 limit. the one end of the open string is xed and the other end can be located
anywhere in the d2 worldvolume. we have a continuous distribution of d0s in d2.

the appearance of a large number of light states in the zero-slope limit for b negative can
also be understood in the framework of two d-branes intersecting at angles. as we will show
in the next section, when  is about zero, the corresponding angle is about zero. we have a
coguration of two d1 branes with very small relative angle, which is nearly supersymmetric.
the excitations are almost massless.

10

this completes our discussion of the d0-d2 system with bij background. the d0-d4
system with bij background has been discussed in [5] and we will recapitulate this case very
briey for the sake of completeness. the four lowest energy states including the ground state
have energies

e+

 = 

(1 + 2  1) ,

e 

 = 

(1  2) .

(2.44)

by denition, the gso projection keeps the states with energies e+
 and leaves out the states
with energies e 
 in the entire region of 1 and 2. when p f (b) > 0, the d0-d4 system is
tachyonic. the tachyon mass squared is of order 1/ in the   0 limit. it implies that
this is a standard d0-d0 tachyon. when p f (b) < 0, and after the gso projection, the
lowest state and the rst three excitations survive the   0 limit. as in the d0-d2 case,
the one-particle excitations from the lowest fermionic partners of the other directions and
the multiparticle excitations of arbitrary varieties consisting of the lowest bosonic mode give
light states in the zero-slope limit. we have a large number of light states here.

let us now turn to the d0-d6 case. in the d0-d6 system with bij eld, the ground state

in the ns sector has energy

by denition, the gso projection keeps the states with energies e+ and projects out the
states with energies e . with this choice, we see if some light states exist.

when p f (b) is positive, namely, either all of bi s are positive, or two are negative and the
one is positive, e+ is about  1
2. we have a tachyonic state and three excited states, all with
mass squared being of order 1 in the unit of 1/. these states do not survive the   0
limit. when p f (b) is negative, we have two possibilities: either all of bi s are negative, or
two of them are positive and the one is negative.

one can also act on these states with an arbitrary polynomial consisting of the lowest bosonic

the gso projection selects the states with energies e+. it is not dicult to nd that, for
p f (b) > 0, we have no light state and the mass squared of the tachyonic state is of order

iii. the relation with the branes at angles

it has been realized for some time that the system of the two d-branes at angles is t-dual
to the p-p system with background f = f +b [10, 11]. for example, in the case of d2-d2 at
angles, the bps conguration is t-dual either to the d0 bound to d4 as a self-dual instanton
or to the d0 bound to d4 as an anti-self-dual instanton. now working on the p-p system
in the presence of bij eld, we reconsider its relation with the conguration of the branes
at angles, focusing on the bps conguration, the existence of light states and the moduli
of noncommutative instantons. the properties of the system of branes at angles have also
been discussed in [12].

in the generic p-p system with bij eld, the boundary condition of the p-p open string

is

 xj|=0 = gijxj + 2ibij xj|= = 0 .

(3.1)

let us rst consider the d0-d2 case, i.e. i, j = 1, 2, as the boundary conditions of the
generic p-p system reduce to those of this case. via t-duality, we will relate this case to the
system of two d1-branes intersecting at an angle.

14

we study an open string ending on two d1-branes at an angle  in the (x1, x2)-plane.
in terms of the coordinates

we take one of them to be aligned along the x1 direction.
z = x1 + ix2, the boundary conditions are [13]

 = 0 ,

re(z) =  im(z) = 0 ,

 =  , re [exp(i)z] =  im [exp(i)z] = 0 .

(3.2)

writing in components, eq. (3.2) becomes

where

 = 0, x1 = 0,  x2 = 0 ,

 = ,

(x2 + bx1) = 0 ,

 (bx2  x1) = 0 ,

tan  = 

1
b

.

after taking t-duality in the x1 direction

x1  i x1 ,

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

the boundary condition becomes identical to that of the d0-d2 system with bij (2.3), which
we wanted to show.

from eq. (3.4), we obtain

 ,
   .

(3.6)

 = 


this means that we have two choices of angles corresponding to the same b or . which
identication we should adopt depends on the ways the gso projection is made. for the
systems of dp-dp at angles, we take the gso projection so that when all the angles i vanish
we have supersymmetric systems, i.e. the systems of dp-dp not dp-dp. we have to x the
identcation between the angles i and i in such a way as the situation is cosistent with
the gso projections taken in the last section.

in what follows we will x the relations between the angles and s for all cases discussed
in the last section. we will show that the energies of the ground states surviving the gso
projection that we obtained in the last section are described in the forms related to the bps
conditions for the systems of the d-branes at angles.

let us look at the d0-d2 system more closely. taking t-duality, we obtain d1-d1 at an
angle . since the system must be supersymmetric when  = 0, the gso projection (2.37)
tells us to identify  with  in the following way,

 = .

(3.7)

it follows that the energy e  in (2.37) of the sate surviving the gso projection is expressed
as

e  = 

 .

(3.8)

15

1
2

for b < 0 we have   0 in the zero-slope limit. the system becomes almost sypersymmetric,
i.e. the d1-d1 system, and the ground state is nearly massless. the bosonic uctuations
generated by s with energy  = /  0 give us a large number of light sates in this limit.
on the other hand, for b > 0 we have   . the system becomes non-supersymmetric, i.e.
almost d1-d1 system, and the ground state becomes tachyonic.

as we pointed out in the last section, when  varies from 0 to 1 the level crossing happens
between the ground state and the rst excited state. this yields the apparent ip of the
gso projection. combining this fact and the identication (3.7), we are able to explain how
we can convert the d1-d1 system ( = 0) continuously to the d1-d1 system ( = ) while
they have the gso projections opposite to each other.

as the next example, let us consider the d0-d4 case with b eld. when we take t-
duality in the x1- and the x3-directions, the system becomes d2-d2 at angles 1 and 2 in
(x1, x2)- and (x3, x4)-planes respectively. for the consistency with the gso projection (2.44)
we should identify the angles with s as follows:

1 = 1 ,

2 = 2   .

(3.9)

among the supersymmetry conditions for the system of d2-d2 at angles

1 + 2  0 , 1  2  0 (mod 2) ,

(3.10)

the former equation is that for the present d0-d4 system. the energies e+
states surviving the gso projection are expressed as

 in (2.44) of the

e+

 = 

1
2

(1 + 2) .

(3.11)

for p f (b) > 0 we have 1 + 2   in the zero-slope limit. we have an almost d2-d2
system and the ground sate is tachyonic. for p f (b) < 0 we obtain 1 + 2  0 in the
zero-slope limit. we obtain an almost d1-d1 system. the lowest energy states are almost
massless and the bosonic uctuations with energies proportional to the very small angles
give us many light states in this limit.

on the other hand, if we consider the d0-d4 system, we should choose the gso projected
states with energies e 
2 (1  2), which is proportional to 1  2 under identication
i = i. note that the condition for supersymmetry now turns out to be the latter equation
in eq. (3.10). therefore, only when p f (b) > 0, we have a large number of light states coming

 =  1

16

from the d0-d0 pairs. it can be interpreted as the uctuations around the supersymmetric
conguration in the picture of branes at angles.

another point which is worth mentioning is that the supersymmetric condition, either of
the form of 1 + 2 = 0 for d0-d4 or of the form of 1  2 = 0 for d0-d4, is closely related
to the moduli of instantons or anti-instantons on noncommutative r4. as argued in [5], in
the case of d0-d4 with p f (b) < 0, the tachyon mass squared vanishes when b1 + b2 = 0 and
the system is supersymmetric. from the dual picture of branes at angles, this correspond to
1 + 2 = 0 under our identication (3.9). as for d0-d4, when b1 = b2, the system becomes
supersymmetric and bps, representing a point on noncommutative anti-instanton moduli
space.

next we consider the d0-d6 system with b eld. when we take t-duality in three of the
spatial directions along the d6-brane worldvolume, we obtain the system of d3-d3 at angles
1, 2 and 3. by repeating the considerations on supersymmetry and the gso projection
similar to those of the d0-d2 and the d0-d4 cases, we nd that we should choose one of the
following identications:

i = i (i = 1, 2, 3) ,

1 = 1 , 2 = 2   , 3 = 3   ,

(3.12)

and its permutations. in both identications, the energies e+ of the states surviving the
gso projection, listed in (2.47), are expressed as

2e+ 

(1  2  3)
(1 + 2  3)
(1  2 + 3)
(1 + 2 + 3)

(mod 2) .

(3.13)




from this we nd that when the states become massless, the condition that supersymmetry
for the system of d3-d3 at angles be unbroken is satised. this means that at least one of
the following equations holds:

1  2  3  0

(mod 2) .

(3.14)

finally let us consider the case of d0-d8. taking t-duality in four of the spatial directions
along the d8-brane worldvolume, we obtain the system of the d4-d4 at angles i (i =
1, . . . , 4). in this case we should choose one of the following identications:

1 = 1   ,

i = i (i = 2, 3, 4) ,

1 = 1 ,

i = i   (i = 2, 3, 4) ,

(3.15)

17

and the permutations of them. as in the three previous cases, supersymmetry is partially
recovered when some states of energy e+ listed in eq. (2.58) become massless. therefore at
least one of the following conditions for supersymmetry is satised:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4  0,

(mod 2) ,

1 + 2  3  4  0,

(mod 2) ,

1  2  3 + 4  0,

(mod 2) ,

1  2 + 3  4  0,

(mod 2) .

(3.16)

obviously, for p f (b) < 0 a large number of light states appear in the zero-slope limit and
for p f (b) > 0 the system is not supersymmetric and the t-dualized picture is almost d4-d4
pair.

iv. one-loop amplitudes and the branes with relative motion

in this section we will relate the p-p system in the presence of bij eld with moving d-
branes. as is well known, the system of the d-branes with relative motion has a connection
with d-branes in a constant electric background [15, 17, 12]. in the last section we considered
the d-branes in a constant magnetic eld, which can be related to d-branes at angles by
t-duality. therefore in a generic b background, the p-p system can be either thought of
as d-branes with relative motion or the ones with relative orientation. this fact reminds us
of the motion of a charged particle in the presence of constant electric eld or magnetic eld.

suppose that the two d-branes move with a relative velocity v. the mode expansion of
an open string satisfying the appropriate boundary condition has almost the same form as
eq. (2.4) but with a pure imaginary parameter:

i 

arctan(v)



=  ,

(4.1)

where  is the parameter in the mode expansion (2.4). this identication shows that the
two problem can be treated in one way.

as an illustration, let us consider the open string one-loop vacuum amplitude for the

d0-d2 case. it takes the form

with y being the distance between two d-branes. we denote by nn the number of directions

(4.8)

let us focus on the long range potential between the branes. we approximate eq. (4.4)
in the limit of   0 and small t. using the modular property of jacobi function, we nd
that

we can read o the potential in the zero-slope limit from the amplitude (4.14). for
b < 0 i.e.   0, we have a quite small potential showing that the system is in an almost
supersymmetric conguration. for b > 0,  tends to 1. the potential becomes very large.
this indicates that the system is far from being supersymmetric.
