the -symmetry of an open m 2-brane ending on an m 5-brane requires geometrical
constraints on the embedding of the system in target superspace. these constraints
lead to the m 5-brane equations of motion, which we review both in superspace
and in component (i.e.
in green-schwarz) formalism. we also describe the em-
bedding of the chiral m 5-brane theory in a non-chiral theory where the equations
of motion follow from an action that involves a non-chiral 2-form potential, upon
the imposition of a non-linear self-duality condition. in this formulation, we nd
a simplied form of the second order eld equation for the worldvolume 2-form
potential, and we derive the nonlinear holomorphicity condition on the partition
function of the chiral m 5-brane.

1 introduction

the m 5-brane is an important ingredient of m -theory. studies of coincident
m 5-branes, m 2-branes stretched between m 5-branes, and wrapping of m 5-
branes around various internal space, for example, have led to discoveries of
remarkable non-perturbative phenomena.

while there are many ways to understand the existence of the m 5-brane, it was
rst discovered as a classical solution of d = 11 supergravity 1. a particularly
interesting way of describing the m 5-brane is to view it as the surface on which
an open m 2-brane can end 2,3 b. in this picture, among other things, the full
m 5-brane equations of motion follow from the requirement of -symmetry of
the open m 2-brane action.

in this article, we focus on some aspects of the m 5-brane which deal with
the structure of the m 5-brane equations of motion and the embedding of the
theory into a non-chiral theory that admits an action formulation. to be more
specic:

a) we review the derivation of the basic constraints on the geometry of the
embedding of the m 5-brane super worldvolume into the target super-
space from the requirement of -symmetry of an open m 2-brane ending
on the m 5-brane 5.

b) we review the key results for the m 5-brane equations of motion following
from the constraints both in superspace as well as component (i.e. green-
schwarz) formalism 6,7,8.

c) we describe the embedding of the chiral m 5-brane theory in a non-chiral
theory where the equations of motion follow from an action that involves
a non-chiral 2-form potential, upon the imposition of a non-linear self-
duality condition.

the non-chiral formulation of the m 5-brane does not contain any lagrange
multipliers or auxiliary elds. it is, however, equivalent to a scale invariant
formulation 9, which does contain a lagrange multiplier scalar eld and a
5-form potential.
it diers, on the other hand, from the intrinsically chiral
formulation of [10] which contains an auxiliary scalar eld.

b the open m 2-brane whose boundary moves freely in target spacetime was considered
briey in [4] but it was realized that the attendant boundary condition necessarily breaks
the d = 11 lorentz invariance. therefore the emphasis was put strictly on the closed
supermembrane in all the early studies of the m 2-brane.

2

in the non-chiral formulation, we also nd a simplied form of the second order
eld equation for the worldvolume 2-form potential, and we derive a nonlinear
holomorphicity condition on the partition function of the chiral m 5-brane.

the results mentioned in (a) and (b) are covered in sec. 2 and 3, and they are
based on [5] and [6, 7, 8], respectively. the results mentioned in (c) are covered
in sec. 4, and they are essentially based on [9]. sec. 4 does contain, however,
some new results.

2 an m 2-brane ending on the m 5-brane

the m 5-brane equations of motion can be derived from the considerations of an
open m 2-brane ending on the m 5-brane 5. consider an open m 2-brane ending
on the m 5-brane whose worldvolume is a (6|16)-dimensional supersubmanifold
of the (11|32)-dimensional target superspace. we use the notation (d|d),
where d is the real bosonic dimension and d is the real fermionic dimension
of a supermanifold. thus, denoting the worldvolume of the m 2-brane by ,
the m 5-brane worldvolume by m5 and the target superspace by m , we have
the chain of embedding:

  m5  m .

(1)

in this approach it is important to note the m 2-brane worldvolume  is purely
bosonic, while the manifold m5 on which it ends, which is of course the m 5-
brane worldvolume, is a supermanifold. thus the worldvolume supersymmetry
of the m 5-brane is manifest, while the worldvolume supersymmetry of the m 2-
brane is not manifest as it is the case in any green-schwarz type brane action.
in this sense this formulation is a hybrid one.

the worldvolume supersymmetry of the m 2-brane can be made manifest as
well, by elevating the worldvolume  into a (3|16)-dimensional supermanifold
m2, thus having the superembedding chain: m2  m5  m .
both approaches yield the same superembedding equations for the m 5-brane.
these equations, which will be derived below in the hybrid formulation, are
constraints on the embedding that lead to full, covariant equations for the
m 5-brane that we will spell out in section 3.

in this section, we will consider the embedding chain (1). for simplicity, we
will take  to consist of a single boundary component. we use the notations
and conventions of [6]. in particular, we denote by zm = (xm, ) the local

3

coordinates on m , and a = (a, ) is the target tangent space index. we use
the ununderlined version of these indices to label the corresponding quantities
on the worldsurface. the embedded submanifold m , with local coordinates
ym , is given as zm (y).

we consider the following action for an open supermembrane ending on a
supervebrane 5

s = z

d3(cid:0)g + ijkcijk(cid:1) +z

d2rsars ,

(2)

where i (i = 0, 1, 2) are the coordinates on the membrane worldvolume ,
r (r = 1, 2) are the coordinates on the boundary , gij is the metric on 
and g = det gij.
in addition to the usual super 3-form c3 in (11|32) dimensional target super-
space m , we have introduced a super 2-form a2 on the (6|16) dimensional
supervebrane worldvolume m5, which is a supersubmanifold of m . the suit-
able pullbacks of these superforms, and the induced metric occurring in the
action are dened as:

cijk

:= izm jzn kzp cp n m ,

ars

:= rym syn an m ,

gij

:= (cid:0)izm em

a(cid:1)(cid:0)jzn en

b(cid:1) ab ,

(3)

where ab is the minkowski metric in eleven dimensions and em
space supervielbein. dening the basis one-forms ea = diizm em
ea = drrym em

a is the target
a and
a is the supervielbein on m5, note the useful

the action (2) is invariant under dieomorphisms of , with suitable boundary
conditions imposed on the parameter of the transformation, as well as the
tensor gauge transformations c3 = d2 and a2 = f5 2 where 2 is a
super 2-form in m , and f 
5 is the pullback associated with the embedding map
f5 : m5  m .
we shall now require the total action to be invariant under the -symmetry
transformation. on the interior of , they take the usual form

za = 0 ,

z =  ()(1 + (2)) 

 ,

(6)

where za := zm em

a and

(7)

we also need to specify the fermionic -symmetry transformations of za on
the boundary . without loss of generality, they take the form

za = 0 ,

z =  ()p 



on  ,

(8)

where p 

 is some projector (see (11)).

we next derive the consequences of the -transformations specied above.
to do so, we rst observe that an arbitrary transformation of ym induces a
transformation on zm given by

za = yaea

a

on m ,

(9)

where ya = ym em

a.

it is useful to introduce a normal basis ea = ea
point on the worldsurface. the inverse of the pair (ea

where (5), dened by these equations, satises 2
(5) = 1. its explicit form is
not needed at the moment, but it will be spelled out in the next section (see
(33)).
the variation z given in (8) satises p (1 (5)) = 0 on the boundary .
 and
this can be seen by multiplying the a =  component of (9) by e
= 0. thus the projector p introduced in (8) is given by
noting that e

b can be gauged away by using the bosonic
b = 0,

a = a. hence, one can set e

ya = 0 ,

(13)

 = z on
on , and hence on m . next, using (13) in (9), we nd ye
the boundary  which implies y = ze
 on the boundary . this
means that the variation y is an arbitrary odd-dieomorphism, eecting
the 16 fermionic coordinates of m , and that when restricted to , it agrees
with the -symmetry transformation on m , which also has 16 independent
fermionic parameters.

we now turn to the derivation of the constraint on the m 5-brane embedding
mentioned earlier. using this in a = b component of (12), and observing
that y is an arbitrary odd dieomorphism of m , it follows that e
= 0.
recalling that e

b = 0 as well, we get

b

e

a = 0 .

(14)

this is the superembedding condition that plays a crucial role in the description
of superbrane dynamics 6,7,8.

now we are ready to seek the conditions for the -symmetry of the action (2).
using (9) and (13) in the variation of the action, we nd that the vanishing of

6

the terms on  imposes constraints on the torsion super 2-form t a and the
super 4-form h4 = dc3, such that they imply the equations of motion of the
eleven dimensional supergravity 4. the non-vanishing parts of the target space
torsion are 11,12

the remaining variations are on the boundary, and yield the nal result

where we have introduced the following super 3-form in m5:

since y are arbitrary, the vanishing of (17) implies the constraint

fba = 0 .

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

thus the only non-vanishing component of h is habc. the constraints (14)
and (19) encode elegantly all the information on the supervebrane dynamics,
as has been shown in [6, 7, 8].

finally we consider the boundary conditions that arise from the variation of
the action (2). the requirement of the action be stationary when the superme-
mbrane eld equations of [4] hold can readily be shown to impose the following
mixed dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions

invariance of (20) imposes the boundary condition niivr| = 0 and the
reparametrization invariance of the leads to the further boundary condition
nivi| = 0.

3 the covariant m 5-brane equations of motion

here, we give the nonlinear eld equations of the supervebrane equations, up
to second order fermionic terms, that follow from the superembedding condi-
a = 0, which are proposed to arise equally well from the f -constraint
tion e
fbc = 0. the details of the procedures can be found in [8]. a key point is
the emergence of a super 3-form h in world superspace. this form arises in
the following component of the embedding matrix

thus, using (19), it follows immediately that

(36)

which can also be veried by direct computation by combining (32) and (35).

the equations of motion (25) have been shown 10 to be equivalent to those
which follow from an action with auxiliary scalar eld 15.

we conclude this section by elucidating the consequences of the central equa-
tion (32). to this end, we rst note the useful identities

m2 = 2m  q, we readily nd the nonlinear self-duality equation

 fmnp = q1gm

(38)

this equation can be expressed solely in terms of f3. to do this, we rst insert

4 the m 5-brane action for an unconstrained 2-form potential

while the superembedding constraints yield the covariant equations of motion
it is desirable to have an action from which these equations of motion can be
derived. there exists a universal action formula which emerges naturally in the
superembedding approach 14. however, as we shall see in section 5, this action
formalism is not directly applicable to branes with self-dual eld strengths in
the worldvolume such as the m 5-brane.

12

a manifestly target space supercovariant and -invariant action, which con-
tains an auxiliary scalar and from which the self-duality condition can be de-
rived as an equation of motion has been constructed 10. however, as has been
argued by witten, any attempt to even dene a proper partition function for
the m 5-brane using this action requires a choice of the auxiliary scalar whose
topological class in general breaks some of the symmetries of m -theory. the
root of this problem lies in the fact that the theory, in eect, describes a chiral
2-form 16.

one resolution of this problem involves the embedding of the chiral theory
into non-chiral one 16. at the classical level, this amounts to nding an action
involving an unconstrained 2-form potential a2 such that its eld equation is
equivalent to the bianchi identity df3 = h 4 and the action is -invariant
upon the imposition of the self-duality condition.

at the quantum level, the decoupling of the unwanted chirality components
amounts to imposing a constraint on the partition function z[c3], which, at
the linearized level, reads 16

dabcz[c3] = ig(cid:10)f +

abc(cid:11) ,

where the functional derivative dabc is dened as

dabc

:=



c abc + i

2g  cabc .

(46)

(47)

abc couples to cabc.

thus dabcz = 0, and only f +
motivated by these considerations, a non-chiral extension of the m 5-brane was
constructed in [9], where it was found that the connection between -symmetry
and self-duality is sucient to determine the action and the non-linear self-
duality condition (38).

the key to the construction of the action is the fact that the non-linear self-
duality condition (38) can be written in the following form

 f3 =

k
f3

.

(48)

where k can be computed with the help of the identities presented in the
previous section. the result is

13

k = 2 q1 + 1

12f 2 + 1

288 (f 2)2  1

96fabcf bcdfdeff ef a ,

(49)

modulo terms whose f3-derivatives vanish when (38) holds. one also nds the
useful relation 9:

k = 2k

for

 f3 =

k
f3

.

in view of (48), a suitable action is given by

s = z ( 1

2  k  z6) ,

where the wess-zumino term

z6 = c6  1

2 c3  f3 .

(50)

(51)

(52)

the rational behind this action is as follows: treating f3 as subject only to
the bianchi identity df3 = h 4, and varying (51) with respect to the uncon-
strained two-form potential a2 one nds thatd

d(cid:18)

f3(cid:19) = h 4 .
k

(53)

combining this second order equation for a2 with the bianchi df3 = h 4,
we nd that the only possible self-duality condition that can be imposed is
precisely (48). moreover it was shown in [9] that the action (51) has the
-symmetry characterized by

zm = m ,

a2 = ic3 ,

(54)

provided that the self-duality condition (38) is satised and the -parameter
is projected as

m =   1

2 (1 + ) 

 e

m ,

(55)

dnotice that the c6 term in the action does not aect the a2 eld equations. nonetheless
it is needed for -symmetry of the action.

14

where

 = k1(cid:0) + 1

12  f mnpmnp(cid:1) .

(56)

the equivalence between the -symmetry transformations (54)-(55) and those
which arise from the superembedding formalism as given in (35)-(36), follows
from the identities

(1 + )(1  ) = 0 = (1 + )(1  ) ,

(57)

which can be shown with the help of (32) and (39).

we emphasize that the self-duality condition (38) does not follow directly as
an equation of motion from the action (51). instead, as we saw above, it is
recovered as the only self-dual truncation of the theory that is consistent in the
sense that it interchanges the bianchi identity df3 = h 4 with the tensor eld
equation (53). actually, the form of k and the self-duality condition (38) can
also be understood 9 by starting from an action of the form s = r ( 1
2  k  z6)
and demanding invariance under the -symmetry transformations of the form
(54)-(55).

we can now derive the non-linear version of the constraint (46) by starting
from the action (51) and the formal denition

z[c3] = z da2 eis .

using the functional derivative (47) we get

dabceis = i

2g(cid:18) k
2g(cid:18) k

c abc  (da2)abc + cabc(cid:19) eis
f abc + fabc(cid:19) eis .

=  i

which means that

dabcz[c3] =  i

2g(cid:28) k

f abc + fabc(cid:29) .

15

(58)

(59)

(60)

since the right side is a projection onto the nonlinearly self-dual part of f3,
this is a proper generalization of the constraint (46) to the nonlinear case. the
full consequences of this constraint remain to be investigated.

the m 5-brane equations of motion

the -symmetry transformations (54)-(55) map the non-linear self-duality
condition (48) into the zm equations of motion, which therefore must agree
with the corresponding results (25) obtained from the superembedding. it is
nonetheless instructive to demonstrate the equivalence of the eld equations
by direct computation. the equations of motion following from the action (51)
followed by the use of the self-duality equation (38) are:

emj m = 0 ,
gpqpfqmn = q(cid:0)hmn + 1
m1m6 (cid:16) 1

where the symmetric bispinor j m is given by

j m = m  + 1

2  f mnpnp  q1gmnn .

(62)

the za eld equation arises as an admixture of the variation with respect to
za and the tensor eld equation obtained by varying the action with respect
to za := v a and a2 = iv c3, such that f3 = iv h 4.
in obtaining the eld equations (61), it is useful to realize that q1gmn ac-
tually is the energy-momentum tensor associated with the composite metric
gmn:

skin
gmn

= 1

2g q1gmn ,

(63)

where skin = r 1
dieomorphism gmn = 2(mn) and f3 = dia2  ih 4 then implies

2  k. the invariance of skin under the bosonic worldvolume

n(q1gmn) =  1

6 h mnpq  fnpq ,

provided that (53) holds.

next, we compare the equations of motion (61) with (25) obtained from su-
perembedding. the scalar eld equations are already in the same form. to
show equivalence of the dirac and tensor equations to those obtained in su-
perembedding formalism requires some work. let us begin with the dirac
equation. the -symmetry of this equation implies that

(1 + )j m = 0 = j m(1  t ) .

eq. (57) then implies

(1 + )j m = 0 = j m(1  t ) .

(65)

(66)

from (33) it follows that  = x1x and t = x x1 where we have
6 habcabc), which implies that (1  )xj m = 0 =
introduced x := exp( 1
j mx(1+). on the other hand, from mabb  = mabb and (1) = 1
it follows that the dirac equation in (25) is annihilated from the right by 1 + .
hence, upon multiplication from right by x the dirac equation (61) will be
indeed one can verify that (1  )mabb = qj ax,
proportional to (25).
which shows the equivalence between the two dirac equations.

as for the tensor eld equation, we have veried that it turns into the one
obtained in the superembedding formalism (see (25)) by using the identity
m2 = 2m  q. it is worth noting that the eld equation for a2 given in (61)
is considerably simpler than the form it takes in (25).

dualization of the non-chiral action

as a check of the formalism, let us briey discuss the dualization of the non-
chiral theory. to this end we introduce a dual 2-form potential a2 as a la-
grange multiplier for the bianchi identity df3 = h 4 and integrate out a2
via its eld strength f3, which yields the dual partition function

z[c3] = z df3 d a2 eis

i

2 r a2d(f3+c 3)

:= z d a2 ei s .

(67)

the dual action s can easily be computed in the saddle point approximation
which yields

17

s = z ( 1

2  k  z6) ,

(68)

where we have used the notations  k := k f3f3 and z6 := c6 1
2 c 3 f3
where f3 is supposed to be expressed in terms of the dual eld strength f3
via

f3

:= d a2  c3 = 

k
f3

.

(69)

varying (68) with respect to a2 and using (69), one nds the dual second order
tensor eld equation df3 = h 4, where, as mentioned above, f3 is expressed
in terms of f3 via (69). thus, in the saddle point approximation, the chiral
truncation of the dual theory is given by f3 = f3, which from (69) is seen to be
equivalent to the condition (48) for chiral truncation of the original non-chiral
theory.
in other words, the non-chiral theory and its dual have equivalent
chiral truncations.

a scale invariant formulation of the non-chiral action

the action discussed at length in the previous section is equivalent to the
scale invariant form of the action constructed in [9]. in the latter formulation,
a worldvolume lagrange multiplier scalar eld , and a worldvolume 5-form
potential a5, with eld strength f6 = da5 + z6, are introduced. this con-
struction is parallel to the scale invariant formulations of super p-brane actions
that has been known for sometime 17,18.

the m 5-brane action constructed in [9] is given by

s = 1

2 z (cid:0) 1

4k2  (f6)2(cid:1) .

(70)

to verify that the equations of motion following from this action are equivalent
to those which follow from (51), we begin by varying (70) with respect to 
and the 5-form potential a5. this yields two rst order eld equations, namely
f6 =  1
2k (where the sign reects the duality of the 2-form potential), which
determines a5 up to a gauge, and d(  f6) = 0, which we solve by taking
 = 2t5 k1, where the integration constant t5 is the m 5-brane tension. the

18

remaining equations of motion from s follow by varying zm and the 2-form
potential a2. denoting a general variation of this kind by , we nd that

s = 1

2 z (cid:20)(cid:18)(cid:16) 1

4k2 + (f6)2(cid:17) 1
g

g + 1

2k k(cid:19)  2(f6)z6(cid:21) .

(71)
2k and  = 2t5 k1 in this formula, one then

using the relations f6 = 1
immediately nds s = t5s.

relation to an m 5-brane action in superembedding approach

it has been shown how green-schwarz type actions can be systematically con-
structed for most branes starting from the superembedding approach 14. the
construction yields a general action formula. the only branes for which this
formula runs into an obstacle are those which contain worldvolume chiral p-
form potentials, such as the m 5-brane. it is, nonetheless, interesting to see the
result one obtains by a naive application of this action formula to this case. in
doing so, we will nd an action which is closely related to the one discussed
above.

the application of the action formula to the m 5-brane proceeds as follows.
dening

w7

:= dz6 = h 7 + 1

2 h 4  f3

(72)

and using the fact that de rham cohomology of the supermanifold m coincides
with that of its body m one can always write

w7 = dk6

(73)

for some globally dened 6-form k6 on m . furthermore, since none of the
target space elds or the worldsurface elds has negative dimension, it follows
that the only non-vanishing component of k6 is the purely bosonic one. in
components this means

ka1a5 = 0 .

19

(74)

the application of the general action formula of [14] to the present case gives
the functional

s

:= zm0

i(k6  z6) ,

(75)

where i : m0  m is the embedding of the body m0 of m into m . s is
by construction only dened for self-dual habc or, equivalently, for the 3-form
eld strength fabc obeying the non-linear self-duality condition (48). s is
manifestly invariant under reparametrizations of m0 and the -transformations
(35) and (36) as these transformations are generated by iv, where v is a
supervectoreld on m , and i vil6 = i{d, iv}l6 = diivl6 where l6 =
k6  z6.
to nd k6 we insert the constraint (74) into (73). after some algebra one
nds that the dimension 0 component yields

 k6 = k ,

(76)

where k is given by (40). therefore, in view of (50), s is simply the restriction
of the action (51) to the constraint surface dened by the non-linear self-duality
condition (48).
