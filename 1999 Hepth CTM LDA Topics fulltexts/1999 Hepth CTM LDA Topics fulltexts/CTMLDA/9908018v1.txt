abstract

up to overall harmonic factors, the d8-brane solution of the massive type

iia supergravity theory is the product of ninedimensional minkowski space

(the worldvolume) with the real line (the transverse space). we show that the

equations of motion allow for the worldvolume metric to be generalised to an arbi-

trary ricciat one. if this ninedimensional ricciat manifold admits killing

spinors, then the resulting solutions are supersymmetric and satisfy the usual

bogomolnyi bound, although they preserve fewer than the usual one half of the

supersymmetries. we describe the possible choices of such manifolds, elaborating

on the connection between the existence of killing spinors and the selfduality

condition on the curvature twoform. since the d8-brane is a domain wall in

ten dimensions, we are led to consider the general case: domain walls in any

supergravity theory. similar considerations hold here also. moreover, it is shown

that the worldvolume of any magnetic brane  of which the domain walls are

a specic example  can be generalised in precisely the same way. the general

class of supersymmetric solutions have gravitational instantons as their spatial

sections. some mention is made of the worldvolume solitons of such branes.

1 introduction

the discovery of branes in string theory has brought about some revolutionary advances in

recent years. from what was initially a purely perturbative theory, it has been possible to

extract nonperturbative results which have led to new and deep insights into the nature of

string theory. perhaps the most farreaching of these has been the discovery of string the-

orys elevendimensional origin, m-theory, with its lowenergy limit of elevendimensional

supergravity.

ignoring for the time being the d8-brane, the tendimensional type iia and iib super-

gravity theories have solutions which describe the various p-branes of type iia and iib string

theory. the eld content of the supergravity theories is precisely what is needed to imply

the existence of such branes: the relevant (p + 1)form potentials are all present [1]. the

fundamental string and its magnetic dual, the 5-brane, couple to the neveuschwarzneveu

schwarz (ns-ns) potentials; these being present in both the type iia and iib theories. in

addition to these are the dp-branes, which couple to the ramondramond (r-r) (p + 1)

form potentials: the type iia theory has p even, and type iib has p odd. for p < 3, the

branes couple to an electric eld strength  these are the fundamental, or electric, branes.

in d dimensions, hodge duality allows for a (p + 2)form eld strength to be interchanged
with a (d  (p + 2))form eld strength, so the branes with p > 3 couple to the dual, mag-
netic eld strength. these are the solitonic, or magnetic, branes. (the d3-brane is a special

case, being selfdual in ten dimensions.) all such branes preserve onehalf of the space-

time supersymmetries. moreover, they all have a clear and welldened elevendimensional

origin.

the only aspect of this unied picture which is somewhat unclear is that of the d8-

brane of type iia string theory. this is a domain wall in ten dimensions, which should

couple to a tenform eld strength or, by hodge duality, a scalar. as rst pointed out by

polchinski [2], the once relatively obscure generalisation of the type iia supergravity theory

found by romans [3]  the massive iia theory  has the necessary eld content [4]. since

type iia string theory necessarily includes a d8-brane, it would seem that it is the romans

theory which is the natural lowenergy limit of type iia string theory.

the romans theory has some unusual properties: tendimensional minkowski space is

not a solution. indeed, none of the kaluzaklein compactications of the theory originally

considered by romans [3] are supersymmetric. this is in contrast to the d8-brane solution [5,

1

4] which preserves the usual one half of the tendimensional supersymmetries. moreover,

the elevendimensional origin of the romans theory is quite mysterious (although see [6]). if

the theory is to nd a place within m-theory, then presumably the d8-brane would be the

dimensional reduction of an m9-brane [7]. it is unclear, however, how this works in detail.

although we do not consider it here, mention should be made of an alternative ten

dimensional massive supergravity theory, that of howe, lambert and west [8]. unlike the

romans theory, this does have a welldened elevendimensional origin [8, 9], but its con-

nection with string theory is unclear: the ns-ns twoform which couples to the fundamental

strings can be gauged away, so it would seem that this theory does not contain such strings

at all.

all the p-brane solutions of the various supergravity theories, including the d8-brane,

have a common form: in the einstein frame the line element is

ds2 = h 4 d

(d2) dx  dx + h

4d

(d2) dy  dy,

(1)

where {xi} and {y} are the worldvolume and transverse coordinates respectively. the
function h(r) is harmonic on the transverse space, r being the radial coordinate in these
directions. d = p + 1, d = d  d  2 denotes the number of dimensions of the dual brane
and, for d-branes and m-branes, we have  = 4.

now we can ask the question whether it is possible to generalise the metrics on the

worldvolume and transverse space in these solutions. that is, whether the eld equations,

and the supersymmetry conditions, admit general metrics instead of the at ones appearing

above. indeed, there has been some work to show that the transverse space of the electric

branes can be generalised, as long as the metric is ricciat [10, 11, 12]. the resulting

solution will be supersymmetric if and only if the transverse space admits killing spinors.

in the following section of this paper, we show that the worldvolume, as opposed to the

transverse space, of the d8-brane solution can be generalised in just such a manner. that

is, the solution (1) with p = 8 and d = 10 can be generalised so as to include a nontrivial

ricciat worldvolume metric. as long as this metric admits killing spinors, the solution is

supersymmetric, and satises the usual bogomolnyi bound, as we will show in subsection

2.2. we hope that such considerations will shed some light on the elevendimensional origin

of the d8-brane. there are numerous examples in the literature of possible supersymmetric

manifolds which could be taken as the worldvolume of the d8-brane; and we discuss some

of these in subsections 2.3 and 2.4. this involves a consideration of holonomy groups.

2

the spatial sections of the d8-brane can take the form of eightdimensional gravitational

instantons  manifolds with selfdual curvature  of holonomy spin(7). section three is

concerned with the dimensional reduction of the d8-brane, a 7-brane domain wall in nine

dimensions. here we show that the manifolds of g2 holonomy described in the literature are

also selfdual; and that these can be taken as possible spatial sections of this 7-brane.

since the d8-brane is a domain wall, we are led to consider whether the same sort of

generalisations can be made for domain walls in any supergravity theory. we show, in section

four, that this is indeed the case. in particular, it is possible for the 3-brane domain walls

of horavawitten theory to have general ricciat worldvolumes. in section ve we extend

the analysis to arbitrary magnetic branes, of which the domain wall is but a special case.

the general statement is, then, that all magnetic branes can have ricciat worldvolumes.

we concentrate on the m5-brane here. finally, some mention is made of the worldvolume

solitons of such magnetic branes; those of the d4-brane in particular.

the conventions we use are as follows. the signature of the metric is (, +, . . . , +), the
sign of the riemann curvature tensor is dened by rabcdx d = [da, db]xc, and the gamma
matrices satisfy {a, b} = 2gab. as to indices, we take a, b = 0, . . . , d1 to denote spacetime
directions, i, j = 0, . . . , p to denote worldvolume directions, and ,  = p + 1, . . . , d  1 to
denote transverse directions. we are mainly concerned with the case d = 10 and p = 8.

where necessary, we use underlined indices to denote an (pseudo)orthonormal basis and

we work exclusively in the einstein frame. in the following section, we use the notation of

forms as in [4]. that is, a qform q has components qa1...aq given by

q = qa1...aq dxa1  . . .  dxaq ,

and |q|2 = qa1...aq qa1...aq .

2 the romans theory

the tendimensional type iia supergravity theory contains the metric, the dilaton  and a

twoform b in the ns-ns sector, and a oneform potential a and a threeform potential

c in the r-r sector. the massive type iia theory found by romans [3] is constructed by

allowing the two-form to eat the oneform, thereby generating a massive twoform via a

generalised higgs mechanism. with the eld strengths given by

f = 4dc + 6m(b)2,

in ten dimensions, we can consider a tenform eld strength which, by the equations

of motion, must have a constant zeroform hodge dual. this constant is just the mass
parameter, f[10]  m, and the romans theory can be rewritten to include explicitly the
required nineform potential [4]. this is an r-r potential, as required to couple to the
d8-brane [2], which can be seen by transforming to the string frame, g(s)

the d8-brane provides a natural, and nontrivial, background in type iia string the-

ory. indeed, the romans theory has massive fundamental string solutions, coupling to the

massive b eld, in just such a background [13]: a solution which describes the intersection

of a fundamental string with a d8-brane over a d0-brane. this solution reduces to the usual

string solution of the type iia theory if the mass parameter m = 0.

venient, but equivalent, one was given in [4]; in the einstein frame, it is

where {xi} are the worldvolume coordinates. h(y) is harmonic on the single transverse

of the metric as discussed in [14]. with

h(y) = 1 + m|y  y0| ,

(7)

the spacetime is free of curvature singularities which would otherwise be present if we dropped

the constant. there is still a deltafunction singularity at y = y0 however, although this

can be removed, as usual, by adding a source term. the solution then describes a d8-brane

situated at y = y0. note that the mass parameter m can be positive or negative here.

is a solution of the romans theory. the interpretation is obvious: it describes a d8-brane

with ricciat worldvolume. the at case (8) is then a special case of this more general

family of solutions. it should be noted, however, that the isometry group may no longer

be the ninedimensional poincare group. since the overall harmonic function is unchanged,

this generalisation has not altered the singularity structure of the d8-brane, as long as the

metric ij does not have any singularities itself. as an example of a solution which does alter

the singularity structure, the worldvolume of the d8-brane could take the form of a nine

dimensional schwarzschild black hole, although this solution will not be supersymmetric.

2.2 supersymmetric d8-branes and the bogomolnyi bound

ricciatness of ij is a necessary condition for the solutions (13) to be supersymmetric. to

see this, consider the supersymmetry transformations of the spacetime fermionic elds [3]

where  is an arbitrary 32component majorana spinor. setting the dilatino variation (14b)

to zero gives

so  must have a denite chirality, in the sense that y = . this removes one half of the
components of . the sign here is set by the sign of (y  yo), so the chirality of  changes as

we pass through the location of the brane [4]. the vanishing of the gravitino variation (14a)

implies

where di is the covariant derivative with respect to the metric ij. a solution of (16a) is

 = f (y)1/2(x),

where (x) is an so(8, 1) worldvolume spinor which does not depend on y.

the integrability condition of the remaining equation (16b) is, as usual,

[ di, dj] = rijklkl = 0,

where i = f i satisfy {i, j} = 2ij. by contracting (18) with j, we nd

rij = 0,

(17)

(18)

(19)

a necessary condition for the solutions (13) to be supersymmetric.

this can also be seen by a consideration of the integrability condition of the equation

a = da = 0. this is

(20)

the {y, y} component of (20) is trivial. the {y, i} component is just the chirality condition
(15); and the {i, j} component gives

rijkl kl = 0,

as in (18).

either way, ricciatness is a necessary condition for the d8-brane (13) to be supersym-

metric. it is not, however, a sucient condition since we must ensure (18), as opposed to

(19), is satised. in other words, we must be able to construct a solution of

di = 0,

(21)

a killing spinor with respect to the metric ij. the trivial solution is, of course, to set

ij = ij, in which case (x) = 0 is just a constant sixteencomponent majorana spinor. this

7

at case is the maximally supersymmetric solution, breaking one half of the tendimensional

supersymmetries due to the chirality requirement (15). other, more general choices of ij

will, however, break a greater fraction. if (21) admits n solutions, then n/32 of the ten

dimensional supersymmetries are preserved.

it is of interest to note that all such supersymmetric solutions saturate the usual bo-

gomolnyi bound on the mass and charge densities of the brane. to see this, consider the

supercharges per unit eightvolume

q =z

a b ccda b,

(22)

where  is a ninedimensional spacelike surface, the integral over which reduces to one over

the onedimensional space transverse to the brane. the variation of q is

1q2 = [q1, q2] =z

n a bda b,

where n a b = 1a b c2c is the nester form [15]. with (14a), we have

n a b = 1a b cdc2

4 1a b2.

(23)

(24)

the surface integral (23) is evaluated on both sides of the domain wall, i.e. as y  y0 . in
this limit, we have f (y)  1, e

4   1, and   (x). then

1q2 = 

where the relative signs are set by the sign of (y  y0). as long as we can construct killing
spinors on the worldvolume, we thus have d8-branes with both the mass per unit volume,

m, and the charge per unit volume, z, proportional to m. indeed, if we take 1 = 2 = ,

then (26) becomes (cid:16)1  y(cid:17)  which vanishes due to the chirality requirement (15). for an
arbitrary conguration, it can be shown that there is a bogomolnyitype bound m  z [16];
and our ricciat solutions saturate this bound. since all of these latter are thus bps states,

it is not the case that the at solution is energetically favoured over the general ricciat

one.

8

2.3 supersymmetric manifolds, holonomy groups and all that

if by the d8-brane worldvolume, we mean the ninemanifold with line element

ds2 = ij(x)dxidxj,

(27)

then we are interested in ricciat worldvolumes which admit killing spinors. we therefore
consider manifolds of the form rn+1  m8n, with line element
n + ds2,

1 + . . . + dx2

(28)

ds2 = dt2 + dx2

where ds2 is the line element on m8n. the spatial sections of the d8-brane worldvolume
thus have the form rnm8n. we can either take this as a potential d8-brane worldvolume
or, by throwing away the rn factor (and ignoring the overall harmonic function in the

bulk metric), we eectively generate solutions which describe ricciat domain walls in
d = (10  n): (8  n)-branes, with worldvolumes of the form r  m8n. these could be
dimensional reductions of the d8-brane, along the lines of [4], or domain walls in other types

of supergravity theory. as we shall see below, all such domain walls can be generalised to

this ricciat case, so it is indeed of relevance to study the general d8-brane worldvolume

(28).

as is well known, the classication of possible manifolds which admit killing spinors is

given in terms of their holonomy groups. since the d8-brane admits killing spinors as long
m8n does, we are interested in manifolds md with dimensions d = 8, 7, 6, 5, 4. the killing
spinors will then have the form

(x) = 0  

(29)

where 0 is a constant so(n, 1) spinor and  transforms under the holonomy group of md.
perusing bergers list [17], and ignoring the trivial case, the relevant holonomy groups

are as follows. for d = 8, we have h = su(4), sp(2) or spin(7), the rst two corre-

1

32 , 1

sponding to kahler and hyperkahler manifolds respectively. such choices will preserve
16, 3
32 of the tendimensional supersymmetries respectively. for d = 7, 6, 4, we have
h = g2, su(3), su(2) respectively. (we ignore the d = 5 case here, since the holonomy
group is then just h = su(2)  1, so this eectively reduces to the d = 4 case.) manifolds
with these holonomy groups will preserve 1
4 of the tendimensional supersymmetries

16 , 1

8, 1

respectively.

9

in the euclidean regime, there is a connection between supersymmetric manifolds 

those which admit killing spinors  and selfdual manifolds  those which have selfdual

curvature twoforms [18]. the fourdimensional selfduality condition on the curvature

twoform can be generalised to

a b =

1
2

a b c dc d,

(30)

where a b c d is a duality operator, identied with the components of some fundamental,
nowherevanishing fourform on md. just as in four dimensions, this second order equation
on the metric is equivalent to a rst order one on the vielbein [18]:

a b =

1
2

a b c dc d,

(31)

at least for some specic choice of gauge. manifolds which satisfy this can be thought

of as ddimensional gravitational instantons. this is a direct generalisation of the similar

considerations for selfdual yangmills elds in d dimensions:

for d > 4, the operator 

belongs to an irreducible representation of so(d); and if a subgroup h of so(d) can be

found such that the decomposition of this representation under h contains a singlet, then

the corresponding tensor invariant  can be constructed [19]. manifolds with selfdual

connections, in the sense of (31), will then have holonomy group h.

in eight dimensions, the duality operator  can be chosen to be invariant under one of two
maximal subgroups of so(8): (su(4)  u(1))/z4 or spin(7) [19]. the former choice would
generate the eightdimensional kahler manifolds, although it would seem that we cannot

generate the hyperkahler case using this method. the spin(7) case would seem to be

the more interesting, however: starting with  as the unique spin(7)invariant hodge self

dual fourform, it has been shown that any manifold which satises (30) in d = 8, 7, 6, 5, 4
has holonomy group h = spin(7), g2, su(3), su(2)  1, su(2) respectively [18]. this is
just the list of holonomy groups given above. moreover, the d = 8 equation is a master
equation from which the equations in d < 8 can be derived simply by assuming m8 to be
the product of m8n with t n or rn, since the holonomy groups of the latter are trivial.
this exactly parallels the remarks made above: by throwing away the rn piece of the metric

(28), we generate domain walls in lower dimensions. the dimensional reduction is the same

in both cases. so the spatial sections of the d8-brane worldvolume can be identied with

an eightdimensional gravitational instanton, or can be a product of at space with a lower

dimensional instanton.

10

compact manifolds md with the required properties are wellknown. the ddimensional
torus t d is the trivial example, since it has a trivial holonomy group. in d = 8, 7, joyce has

constructed compact manifolds with holonomy groups h = spin(7), g2 respectively [20, 21,

22]. in six dimensions, the calabiyau manifolds have h = su(3), and in four dimensions

the hyperkahler manifold k3 has h = su(2). all such spaces are ricciat as required.

making use of such manifolds as the spatial sections of the d8-brane would give a solution,
the interpretation of which would be of a d8-brane wrapped on md.

2.4 explicit noncompact examples

we are more interested, however, in the unwrapped brane, so we turn our attention to non
compact manifolds md for d = 8, 7, 6, 5, 4. starting with d = 8, m8 can be a noncompact
kahler or hyperkahler manifold with h = su(4), sp(2) respectively. the latter includes

the product of two euclidean taubnut spaces, an asymptotically locally euclidean mani-
fold with holonomy h = sp(1)  sp(1).

more generally, we could make use of the asymptotically locally euclidean toric hyper
kahler manifolds, with a triholomorphic t 2 isometry. the eightdimensional line element

has the local form [11]

ds2 = uabdxadxb + u ab(da + aa)(db + ab),

(32)

s , a = 1, 2, s = 1, 2, 3} are coordinates on two copies of e3 and uab are
where xa = {xa
the entries of a positive denite symmetric 2  2 matrix function u of these coordinates.
u ab are the entries of u1, and the a are periodically identied with period 2. the two
oneforms aa = dxb  ba, where ab are a triplet of 2 2 matrix functions of the xa. the
one-forms satisfy the constraint

where, if the metric is to be nonsingular, {pa} is a set of two coprime integers. a is an
arbitrary threevector, specifying the location of a 3-plane in e6, and uab is a constant.
the metric is entirely nonsingular, as should be the case for the d8-brane worldvolume.

more general solutions, consisting of superpositions of (35) can be constructed [11]. with
uab = ab, the solution is asymptotic to e6  t 2. with papb = ab, and a = 0, the
solution reduces to a product of two euclidean taubnut manifolds, with holonomy group
h = sp(1)  sp(1). the general solution, with h = sp(2), admits three so(8) killing
spinors, so will preserve 3
32 of the tendimensional supersymmetries. the isometry group in
this case is just u(1)2, generated by the killing vectors

we turn, now, to the case in which the holonomy group of m8 is spin(7). complete,
noncompact manifolds with h = spin(7) have been constructed by gibbons et al [23];
these take the form of r4 bundles over s4, and have the line element

10

10

ds2 = 1 (cid:18)m
r (cid:19)
(36)
where s = 1, 2, 3 and m is an integration constant. the {s} and {s} are leftinvariant
oneforms on the principal su(2) bundle over s4, with the singleinstanton connection

s.

this metric is ricciat as required and has the isometry group so(5)  su(2). the
singularity at r = m is a removable bolt singularity which is topologically s4. in the limit
r  m, the metric is that on r4, up to an overall numerical constant, and the boundary at
innity is the squashed sevensphere [24]. the d8-brane with such spatial sections preserves

1
32 of the tendimensional supersymmetries, since the spin(7) manifold admits a single killing
spinor.

the fact that (36) is a selfdual manifold has been underlined in [12]: the same metric is

a solution of the selfduality condition (31), with a b c d the components of the unique hodge

selfdual spin(7)invariant fourform. in this case, the selfduality conditions become [19,

12]

8a =

1
2

ca b cb c,

(37)

where now a, b = 1, . . . 7 and ca b c are the octonionic structure constants. the d8-brane

with such a worldvolume thus has spatial sections which are eightdimensional gravitational

12

instantons. since s7 can be thought of as an s3 bundle over s4, and s3 = su(2), we see

why the su(2) connection appears in the metric. in some sense, this manifold is the eight

dimensional generalisation of the eguchihanson space, the latter making use of the fact
that s3 is an u(1) bundle over s2, and having a squashed threesphere as its boundary at

innity.

3 7-brane domain walls with holonomy g2

as explained in [4], the romans theory can be dimensionally reduced to generate a massive

ninedimensional supergravity theory, despite the fact that the product of ninedimensional

minkowski space with a circle is not a solution of the romans theory. all one needs is a

solution with a u(1) isometry, and this is provided by the d8-brane solution. the new nine

dimensional theory has a cosmological constant in exactly the same way as the romans

theory does; and this allows for the existence of a 7-brane domain wall solution  the

double dimensional reduction of the d8-brane. moreover, it was shown in [4] that this 7-

brane solution is tdual to the direct dimensional reduction of the d7-brane of type iib

supergravity, although the dimensional reduction in this case must be of a scherkschwarz

type [25].

to discuss the 7-brane domain wall of this massive ninedimensional supergravity theory

consider, rst, a d8-brane solution of the form

ds2 = f 2(cid:0)ij(x)dxidxj + dy2

1(cid:1) + dy2

2,

(38)

where now ij is the metric on an eightdimensional manifold. by taking y1 as the coordinate

on a circle, and with f (y2) and the dilaton as in (13), this is the generalisation of the

dimensionally reduced d8-brane of [4]. by throwing away the circular dependance, we have

7-branes with general worldvolumes. these are solutions of the massive ninedimensional

theory of [4] if and only if the metric ij is ricciat, exactly as in the case above. if the

7-brane worldvolume of the form

ds2 = ij(x)dxidxj = dt2 + ds2,

(39)

is to be supersymmetric, the holonomy group of m7, with line element ds2, must be h = g2.
such manifolds have again been constructed by gibbons et al [23], and have a form similar
to the spin(7) manifold (36) discussed above. that is, m7 can be an r3 bundle over s4, or
an r4 bundle over s3.

13

with an appropriate duality operator, and with the caveat to be discussed below, these

manifolds solve the sevendimensional selfduality condition, just as the spin(7) manifold

(36) does in eight dimensions. to see this, consider the selfduality condition (31) with

a b c d the components of the g2invariant, sevendimensional hodge dual of the octonionic

structure constants. explicitly [26],

a b c d =

1
3!

a b c d e f gce f g,

ca b c = +1

for

a b c = 123, 516, 624, 435, 471, 673, 572.

(40)

(41)

where

we thus have

a b c d = +1

for

a b c d = 1245, 2671, 3526, 4273, 5764, 6431, 7531.

(42)

the selfduality conditions (31) are then

71 = 26 + 53,

72 = 61 + 34,

73 = 42 + 15,

74 = 23 + 65,

75 = 46 + 31,

76 = 12 + 54,

63 = 25 + 14.

with the ansatz

ds2 = f 2(r)dr2 + g2(r)2

s + h2(r) (s  as)2 ,

(43)

(44)

the metric on m7 has the form of an r4 principal bundle over s3. since s3 is parallelizable,
this bundle is trivial. {s} are the leftinvariant oneforms on the base space and {s} the
leftinvariant oneforms on the bres. they satisfy

h2(r) =

9

r2 1 (cid:18)m

r (cid:19)3! ,

(49)

where m is an arbitrary integration constant. this is precisely the metric found by solving

the einstein equations in [23]; here, we have derived it from rst order equations alone. in

direct analogy with the spin(7) case (36) above, the bolt singularity here is topologically
s3, and as r  m, the metric (44) reduces to the metric on r4. the boundary at innity is
s3  s3 and the isometry group is so(4)  su(2).

the other sevendimensional g2 metric considered by gibbons et al [23] is that of an
r3 bundle over s4. this is somewhat more complicated than the above example since the

bundle is no longer trivial. it can be shown that g2 holonomy implies selfdual curvature
in the above (g2) sense and, for this reason, it should be expected that the r3 bundle over
s4 is selfdual in the same way as the r4 bundle over s3. this is not the case, however, at
least navely. that is, although the r3 bundle over s4 is ricciat and has g2 holonomy, its

connection oneform does not satisfy the relations (43). moreover, neither does its curvature

twoform satisfy the same relations with a b replaced by a b. a possible explanation of this

is as follows. transforming the orthonormal basis by an arbitrary so(7) rotation will leave

the line element unchanged. such a rotation will have an eect on the curvature two form
however: schematically, if e  ge, where g  so(7), we have   gt g. then the
question is whether this transformation commutes with the duality operator 1
2 in (30).
indeed, since the duality operator is g2invariant, and not so(7)invariant, it is unlikely to

commute with such a rotation. it would seem, then, that a judiciously chosen so(7) rotation

15

of the basis will ensure selfduality of the curvature twoform. this is similar to the four

dimensional case in which, via an so(4) rotation, a manifold with selfdual curvature can

always be brought into a form such that its connection is also selfdual; the dierence being,

of course, that here we do not have a selfdual curvature in the rst place.

at any rate, since both the r4 bundle over s3 and the r3 bundle over s4 are ricciat

manifolds of holonomy h = g2, either manifold can be used as the spatial sections of a

supersymmetric 7-brane in nine dimensions.

4 the general domain wall

considerations similar to the above hold for domain walls in any supergravity theory. for

example, we can dimensionally reduce the d8-brane along the lines of [4], generating domain

walls in d < 10 massive supergravity theories. or we can consider domain walls in massive

gauged supergravity theories [27].

in d dimensions, the domain wall is a (d  2)-brane, which couples to a potential, or

cosmological constant

v () = 2e.

(d  1)
(d  2)

.

(50)

(51)

 is a constant which can be parametrised as

2 =  + 2

the value of  varies from case to case [14]. in certain vacua of gauged supergravities, we
have  = 2(d  1)/(d  2), in which case  = 0, and the potential is a true cosmological
constant. on the other hand, some gauged seven and fourdimensional supergravities have
 = 2. we will take  = 4, however, since this is the value of  for the romans theory and
all its dimensional reductions. (incidentally, the howelambertwest massive supergravity

theory [8] has  = 0. it would seem, then, that this theory does not have the usual brane

solutions, as in (1).)

the relevant lagrangian is

)

(54)

where h(y) is harmonic on the single transverse direction. as explained in [14], we can take

h(y) = 1 + m|y  y0|,

(55)

to avoid potential curvature singularities, as for the d8-brane above.

keeping the dilaton eld and the specic form of the harmonic function h(y) as above,

we generalise the metric to

ds2 = h

1

d2 ij(x)dxidxj + h

d1

d2 dy2.

(56)

this is a solution of the equations of motion (53a,b), as long as the metric ij is ricciat.

that is, any domain wall  not just the d8-brane of above  can in general have a ricciat

worldvolume.

the remarks concerning supersymmetry that we made above can be applied here. that

is, the general domain wall will preserve supersymmetry if and only if the worldvolume

manifold with line element

ds2 = ij(x)dxidxj,

admits killing spinors. as already mentioned, the dimensional reduction of the romans

theory leads to a massive supergravity theory in nine dimensions, with a 7-brane domain

wall. the worldvolume metric of this can then have spatial sections with holonomy group

h = g2.

in d = 8, we can have a 6-brane supersymmetric domain wall, the spatial

sections of which take the form of noncompact calabiyau manifolds with holonomy group

h = su(3) [28].

moving down in dimension, we can have 4-brane domain walls in d = 6 supergravity

theories. these solutions will be supersymmetric if the spatial sections of their worldvolumes

have holonomy group h = su(2). in the compact case, we could consider

ds2 = dt2 + ds2

k3,

where ds2

k3 is the metric on k3. this has the interpretation of a 4-brane wrapped on k3.

or, in the more interesting noncompact case,

ds2 = dt2 + ds2

t n ,

17

where ds2

t n is the asymptotically locally euclidean taubnut metric. the 4-brane world-

volume is then just the vedimensional kaluzaklein monopole [29, 30].

an interesting example is that of the domain walls in horavawitten theory. as is well
known, the strongly coupled e8  e8 heterotic string theory is just m-theory compactied
on an s1/z2 orbifold with a set of e8 gauge elds on each of the orbifold xed planes [31, 32].

the compactication of the elevendimensional theory on a calabiyau manifold leads to

a gauged vedimensional supergravity theory with two fourdimensional boundaries. this

has a solution describing two parallel supersymmetric 3-brane domain walls located at the

orbifold xed planes [33]. on a further dimensional reduction, fourdimensional spacetime

is identied with the 3-brane worldvolume  the universe as a domain wall scenario [33].

this being a specic example of the general case considered here, it should be obvious that

the usual at 3-brane domain walls can be generalised to any ricciat worldvolume.

the relevant vedimensional lagrangian is [33]

s = sbulk + sboundary,

(2)

(57)

where v is a modulus which encodes the variation of the calabiyau volume and  is a

constant mass term, for the denition of which we refer the reader to [33]. the equations

of motion will admit 3-brane solutions of the form

(58)

ds2 = hij(x)dxidxj + h 4dy2,
v (y) = h 3,

h(y) = 1 +

2
3 |y|,




if and only if ij is ricciat. (in the above we have set three arbitrary constants to unity.)

we have checked this solution explicitly.

these 3-branes can have worldvolumes that are fourdimensional schwarzschild black

holes. although not supersymmetric, since the schwarzschild solution does not admit killing

spinors, this is of interest nonetheless. it explains how our fourdimensional universe, upon

a further dimensional reduction, could have the form of a schwarzschild black hole. it would

seem that this embedding of the schwarzschild solution in ve dimensions violates the no

go theorem of [34] but in fact it does not. the theorem is that it is impossible to embed

18

the schwarzschild solution in a at vedimensional spacetime; and our vedimensional

manifold is certainly not at, so there is no contradiction.

5 magnetic branes in general

there has been some discussion in the literature of solutions of supergravity theories which

describe generalised electric branes, in which the transverse space is no longer at. such solu-

tions preserve fewer than the usual one half of the spacetime supersymmetries. the eleven

dimensional membrane solution can be generalised so as to interpolate between eleven
dimensional minkowski space and ads4  m7, where m7 is any einstein space [10]; the
squashed sevensphere for example, which admits killing spinors and so allows for gener-

alised supermembranes. indeed, the eightdimensional spin(7) and hyperkahler manifolds

(36) and (32) above have also been considered as possible transverse spaces of the eleven

dimensional supermembrane [12, 11]; or as the transverse space of the fundamental string

in ten dimensions [12]. here we show that the worldvolume, as opposed to the transverse

space, of the magnetic branes can also be generalised in just such a manner.

a general magnetic p-brane, with p = d  n  2 couples to a rank n eld strength
f[n]. the domain wall is then a specic example of the more general magnetic brane, one

with n = 0 (or, by hodge duality, n = d) [14]. this leads us to consider whether we can

generalise the worldvolume metric of any magnetic brane in the above manner; and the

answer is that we can. heuristically, since the eld strength which couples to a magnetic

brane is nonzero in the transverse directions only and, since we change the worldvolume

metric only, the generalisation will go through in precisely the same way as above. indeed,

it was noted in [35] that the m5-brane worldvolume can be generalised to

ds2 = dt2 + dx2 + ds2

k3.

(59)

this solution has the interpretation of an m5-brane wrapped on k3, as considered from the

point of view of the worldvolume action in [36]. it is a specic example of the more general

claim that we are making here.

the lagrangian relevant to the study of a general magnetic brane is

where the dimensionality of the brane is given by d = p + 1 = d  n  1, and where  is
as in (51) (we set  = 4 here). f[n] is the eld strength which couples to the p-brane. the

harmonic on this space. d = d  d  2 = n  1 is the dimensionality of the electric brane
dual to the magnetic one and the alternating tensor in the expression for the eld strength
has components 1.

where k can be related to the tension of the brane by the inclusion of a source term in the

gravitino is

2 = 1, and we take

(x, y) = (x)  (r).

20

(66)

substituting for the solution (63), and setting the variation  = 0 gives

(r) = h 1

12 (r)0,

for a constant spinor 0, in addition to the usual chirality condition

(1  )  = 0,

(67)

(68)

which removes one half of the supersymmetries. the remaining condition, i = 0, is satised

if and only if

di = 0,

(69)

as promised. all solutions which satisfy this condition will saturate the usual bogomolnyi

bound, as in the d8-brane case above.

instead of the compact manifold in (59), we can make use of the asymptotically locally

euclidean taubnut metric, giving a worldvolume of the form

ds2 = dt2 + dx2 + ds2

t n ,

(70)

which is supersymmetric since the holonomy group of the taubnut space is h = su(2).

there do not seem to be many other possibilities. the ricciat m5-branes no longer
interpolate between elevendimensional minkowski space and ads7 s4. for a worldvolume
of the form (70), the solution at innity in the transverse space is mink7 taubnut, i.e.
the kaluzaklein monopole oxidised to eleven dimensions. as r  0, the line element is

ds2 = r2(dt2 + dx2) + 4k

2
3

dr2
r2 + r2ds2

t n + k

2

3 d2
4,

(71)

which is the metric on the warped product of taubnut with ads3  s4, where the ads3
piece has cosmological constant  = 1/(4k2/3).

the above considerations can be applied to any magnetic brane, although the specic

form of the supersymmetric solutions must be considered case by case.

5.1 worldvolume solitons

asymptotically, the spacetime metrics of the usual brane solutions (1) are at and it is

wellknown that both d-branes and m-branes admit worldvolume solitons when embedded

in such a at spacetime [37]. that is, the diracborninfeld (dbi) worldvolume lagrangian

is linearised and the energy of the branes is minimised for solitonic congurations of the

21

worldvolume elds. now the more general solutions we have been discussing have a ricci

at spacetime metric at innity; and it is of interest to note that branes embedded in such

ricciat spacetimes also have worldvolume solitons, as long as an (anti)selfdual gauge

eld can be constructed on the worldvolume manifold.

consider, then, the simplest example, that of the d4-brane, the double dimensional

reduction of the m5-brane considered above. at innity, the spacetime line element has the

form

ds2 = dt2 + abdxadxb + dy  dy = dt2 + ds2

t n + dy  dy,

(72)

where a, b = 1, . . . 4 and ds2

t n is the asymptotically locally euclidean taubnut metric,

given by

t n = m 2v 1(d  cos d)2 + v (dr2 + r2d2),

ds2
v (r) = 1 + m
r .

)

(73)

the plus (minus) sign corresponds to a selfdual (antiselfdual) manifold respectively and

m is an integration constant.

we work in an orthonormal basis, take all worldvolume scalars to be constant and split the
worldvolume coordinates i = {0, a}. for static congurations, f0a = 0, and  det(gij +
fij) = (g00) det(gab + fab), where gij is the pullback of the spacetime metric. the dbi
lagrangian has the form [37]

where we have set the brane tension and the inverse string tension 2 to unity. e is the
a, the vierbein of gab. f 2 = fa bf a b, f is the hodge dual of f with
determinant of ea
respect to the worldspace directions and f  f = fa b f a b. the lagrangian is linearised for
congurations which satisfy fa b =  fa b and, since we are dealing with the purely static
case the energy density, t 00 = l, is minimised for such (anti)selfdual eld strengths [37].
d4-branes embedded in a general ricciat spacetime will thus have worldvolume solitons

 in this case, abelian (anti)instantons  if and only if a eld strength which is (anti

)selfdual with respect to gab can be constructed.

since no worldvolume scalars are excited, the spatial component of the pullback of the

spacetime metric in the static gauge is just gab = ab. the gauge eld which gives an (anti

22

)selfdual eld strength with respect to this metric is wellknown. with the orthonormal
oneforms e0 = v 1/2dr, e1 = v 1/2rd and e2 = v 1/2r sin d, e3 = mv 1/2(d  cos d),
it is [38]

1
m

v 1/2e3,

which has the eld strength

a =

f =

1

(r + m)2 (e0  e3  e1  e2).

(75)

(76)

this is manifestly (anti)selfdual. although the gauge eld has the usual stringlike singu-

larity along the zaxis, the energy of the instanton is nite.

d4-branes embedded in the spacetime (72) thus have worldvolume solitons in the same

way that the standard at d4-branes do, since (anti)selfdual gauge elds can still be

constructed on their spatial sections. this is of interest for two reasons. firstly, it should

be the case that the m5-brane with worldvolume metric (70) discussed above will have

worldvolume string solitons along similar lines as for the at case [39]. secondly, it should

be possible to generalise our reasoning to the nonabelian dbi action [40, 41] describing

multiple d4-branes. in particular, since it is known how to construct (anti)selfdual su(2)

gauge elds on taubnut space [42], we could consider the action describing two d4-branes

with a twocentered taubnut space as the spatial sections of the worldvolume. the energy

of such congurations will be minimised by these more general nonabelian instantons is

precisely the same way as for the at case [43]. this might provide some clues as to the

nature of d-branes in curved spacetime, a subject which is far from being fully understood.

6 conclusions

we have shown that the worldvolumes of all the magnetic branes of string theory can take

the form of any ricciat manifold. a specic case is the domain wall, the tendimensional

example being that of the d8-brane of string theory. we have shown in detail that the

d8-brane solution of romans massive type iia supergravity theory can be generalised to

include a large class of possible solutions. these are supersymmetric if and only if the

worldvolume manifold admits killing spinors, a necessary, but not sucient, requirement for

which is ricciatness.

we have described some of the eightdimensional manifolds in the literature which do

admit killing spinors, and elaborated on the fact that these are just the selfdual eight

23

dimensional gravitational instantons. the dimensional reduction of the d8-brane is a seven

dimensional domain wall in nine dimensions. in this case, we have shown that the known

manifolds which admit killing spinors satisfy the selfduality condition in seven dimensions,

although the connection between supersymmetric and selfdual manifolds would seem to be

a subtle one in certain cases.

the fact that the magnetic branes can have ricciat worldvolumes is perhaps to be

expected, given the similar results concerning the transverse spaces of the electric branes:

roughly speaking, the transverse space of an electric brane is interchangeable with the world-

volume of the dual magnetic brane. more speculatively, perhaps the requirement of ricci

atness in these cases is a consequence of the beta functions of string theory. after all, to

rst order in the inverse string tension , the beta functions of the conformal eld theory

on the closed string worldsheet imply that the ambient spacetime must be ricciat [44].
