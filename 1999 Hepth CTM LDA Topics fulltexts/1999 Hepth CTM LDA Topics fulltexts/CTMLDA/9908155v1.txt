aspects of type 0 string theory

1. introduction

2

if one would like superstring theory to give rise to some testable predictions in the
low energy regime, at some point one has to explain how supersymmetry is broken
somewhere between the planck and the weak scale.
in another approach one might
contemplate to start already with a non-supersymmetric string theory at the planck
scale. however, generically non-supersymmetric string theories are plagued with
problems luckily absent in supersymmetric string theories. as in the bosonic string
theory, in most non-supersymmetric theories tachyons appear, which in the best of all
imaginable scenarios indicate a phase transition into some stable background. moreover,
without supersymmetry a big cosmological constant is generated by loop corrections in
conict with the small value of the cosmological constant we observe at least in our
universe. non-supersymmetric string theories with vanishing cosmological constant have
been studied in [1]. moreover, the cosmological constant serves as a dilaton potential
leading to the request for stabilization of the dilaton, i.e. of the string coupling constant.
analogously, scalar potentials for all other moduli are usually generated, which must
be stabilized, as well. concerning establishing string dualities, one is also on less solid
ground as compared to supersymmetric string theories. in particular, there is no notion
of bps like objects and masses receive quantum corrections.

in this paper we will mainly deal with the rst of the problems mentioned above,
namely we will construct non-supersymmetric models free of tachyonic modes. more
concretely we will consider special orientifolds of the type 0b string theory, where the
tachyon does not survive the orientifold projection. we will discuss models in ten, six
and four space-time dimensions. in all these models the second of the problems from
above is present, as a dilaton tadpole is generated on the disc world-sheet.
in the
second part we will study the eective gauge theories arising on self-dual d3-branes
in non-compact type 0b orbifolds and orientifolds. this approach was initiated in
[2, 3] where a generalization of ads-cft duality to the the supersymmetric type 0b
backgrounds was presented. here we will mainly focus on the cft side.

this talk is based on [4, 5, 6] where more details can be found.

2. non-tachyonic orientifolds of type 0b

there exist two dierent constructions of type 0b string theory. it can be regarded
rst as the superstring with the projection

p =

(1 + (1)fl+fr) ,

(1)

and second as type iib divided out by the space-time fermion number (1)fs . this
leads to a modular invariant partition function containing a tachyon, a graviton, a
dilaton and an antisymmetric two form in the nsns sector and two further scalars,
two antisymmetric 2-forms and a 4-form in the rr sector. except the tachyon all
these states are massless. since compared to the type iib models all elds in the rr

sector are doubled, the d-brane content is doubled, as well. the explicit form of the
corresponding boundary states was derived in [7]. the two types of d-branes of the
same dimension p are denoted as dp- and dp-branes in the following. studying the
annulus amplitude in tree channel using the boundary states and transforming back
into loop channel one derives that for open strings stretched between the same type of
dp-branes the world-sheet fermions have half-integer mode expansion, whereas for open
strings stretched between a dp- and a dp -rane they have integer mode expansion. in
the rst case one gets space-time bosons and the second case space-time fermions. thus,
even though the closed string type 0b theory is purely bosonic, fermions appear in the
d-brane sector.

as was rst realized in [8, 9] there exist dierent orientifold projections in type
0b. the usual orientifold by the world-sheet parity transformation  yields a model
still containing the tachyon.
in [7, 8] it was shown that the dilaton tadpole can be
cancelled by introducing 32 d9 and 32 anti d9-branes into the background leading
to a gauge group so(32)so(32) and an open string tachyon in the bi-fundamental
representation of the gauge group. the introduction of anti-branes was necessary to
cancel the dangerous rr tadpole. the model above was conjectured to be strong-weak
dual to the bosonic string compactied on the root lattice of so(32). moreover, the
orientifold model still contains a tachyonic tadpole, which can only be cancelled by
introducing instead 16 d9, 16 d9, 16 d9 and 16 d9-branes in the background. this
model has gauge group so(16)so(16) so(16)so(16) and was conjectured to be
related to the tachyon-free so(16)so(16) heterotic string in [6].

an independent model

is dened by combining the world-sheet parity
transformation with the right moving word-sheet fermion number operator  =
(1)fr. in this case there appear rr tadpoles in the klein bottle amplitude which can
be cancelled by 32 d9- and 32 d9-branes. however, from the annulus amplitude there
remains an uncancelled dilaton tadpole which leads to a shift in the expectation values
of the background elds via the fischler-susskind mechanism [10]. the massless closed
string spectrum is given by the bosonic part of type iib spectrum and the self-dual
d9-branes support a u(32) gauge group with majorana-weyl fermions in the 496  496
representation. the closed and open string together cancel the r6 and f 6 anomalies.
note, that in contrast to type i string theory this orientifold still contains dp-branes
for every odd number of p. this orientifold model was conjectured to be related to the
tachyonic u(16) heterotic string theory. for completeness we mention that there exists
a third orientifold projection. the world-sheet parity transformation is combined with
the right moving space-time fermion number operator leading to a tachyon tadpole in
the klein bottle amplitude.

the question is whether the absence of tachyons holds under toroidal orbifold
compactications.
it was argued in [11] that in general this it not the case, as the
world-sheet parity transformation exchanges a g twisted sector with the g1 twisted
sector implying that some linear combinations of the twisted sector tachyons survive
the projection. orientifolds in which the twisted sectors are invariant under  were

aspects of type 0 string theory

discussed in [12, 13] and might have interesting non-supersymmetric generalizations.

from the set of supersymmetric orbifolds there are however two models in which
all tachyons are projected out. in six at space-time dimensions one has the zz2 orbifold
of t 4 with action zi  zi for each of the two complex coordinates. performing the
tadpole cancellation condition, one realizes that all rr tadpoles can be cancelled by
introducing 32 self-dual d9-branes and 32 self-dual d5-branes in the background. at
the massless level the closed string sector contains the graviton, the dilaton, 20 self dual
2-forms, 4 anti-self dual 2-forms and 98 further scalars. in the open string sector one
gets gauge group g=u(16) u(16)|9 u(16) u(16)|5, where the rst two factors live
on the d9-branes and the second two on the d5-branes. the open strings connecting
the various kinds of d-branes and d-branes yield the following massless matter states

4  {(16, 16; 1, 1) + (16, 16; 1, 1) + (1, 1; 16, 16) + (1, 1; 16, 16)}1,1
2  {(16, 1; 16, 1) + (16, 1; 16, 1) + (1, 16; 1, 16) + (1, 16; 1, 16)}(1,1)
2  {(120  120, 1; 1, 1) + (1, 120  120; 1, 1)+

(1, 1; 120  120, 1) + (1, 1; 1, 120  120)}(1,2)

2  {(16, 16; 1, 1) + (16, 16; 1, 1) + (1, 1; 16, 16) + (1, 1; 16, 16)}(2,1)
1  {(16, 1; 1, 16) + (16, 1; 1, 16) + (1, 16; 16, 1) + (1, 16; 16, 1)}(1,2)

(2)

where the index indicates the representation under the su(2)su(2) lorentz-group in
six-dimensions. for the complete closed and open spectrum both the r4 and the f 4
anomaly cancels.

in four at space-time dimensions the orientifold on t 6/zz3 is free of tachyons.
note, that it is only for the zz3 orbifold that the twisted sector ground state energy
vanishes. in this case all rr tadpoles can be cancelled by self-dual d9-branes. in the
closed string sector one gets the graviton plus 10 scalars, including the dilaton and
internal metric moduli, and additional 20 rr-scalars and one vector that arises from
the 4-form. in the twisted sector appears another 27 ns-ns massless scalars and 54
r-r massless scalars.
in the open string sector one obtains gauge group g=u(12)
u(12) u(8) with bosonic and fermionic matter

3  {(66, 1, 1) + (1, 12, 8) + (1, 66, 1) + (12, 1, 8)}l.

this spectrum is chiral and free of non-abelian gauge anomalies. concerning the u(1)
factors, there is one non-anomalous and two anomalous combinations whose anomaly
could presumably be cancelled by a generalized green-schwarz mechanism.

so far we have only considered orbifolds preserving some supersymmetry in the
type iib setting. since type 0b is non-supersymmetric anyway, we are free to consider
more general orbifold actions. one non-tachyonic four dimensional examples of this sort
was discussed in [6]. one simply takes t 6 and divides out by the zz2 action zi  zi for
all three complex coordinates. note, that in type iib this orbifold would not satisfy
in particular, the level-matching condition would be violated in the
level-matching.

ns-r sector, but precisely this sector is absent in type 0b. one subtlety arises in the
ramond sector where the action of the zz2 on the ground states is

r|s1 s2 s3 s4i = ei(s2+s3+s4)|s1 s2 s3 s4i = i|s1 s2 s3 s4i

(4)

with si = 1/2. this action is rather zz4 than zz2.
in the closed string sector the
left-moving ramond sector is always paired with the right-moving ramond sector, so
that the action is really zz2, but in the open string sector this zz4 action on the ramond
ground states has to compensated by a zz4 action on the chan-paton factors. moreover,
the klein bottle amplitude for this model leads to tadpoles which can be cancelled by 32
self-dual d9 -and self-dual d3-branes. the technical aspects of this model are discussed
in length in [6] and everything works out just right to eventually lead to a chiral but
anomaly free massless spectrum. the closed string sector contributes the graviton,
the dilaton and 117 further scalars and the branes support a gauge group g=u(16)
u(16)|9 u(16)  u(16)|3 with matter

6  {(16, 16; 1, 1) + (16, 16; 1, 1) + (1, 1; 16, 16) + (1, 1; 16, 16)}b
4  {(120, 1; 1, 1) + (1, 120; 1, 1) + (1, 1; 120, 1) + (1, 1; 1, 120)}l
4  {(16, 16; 1, 1) + (1, 1; 16, 16)}l
1  {(16, 1; 16, 1) + (1, 16; 1, 16)}l

(5)

thus, we have constructed a couple of tachyon-free non-supersymmetric orientifolds in
various space-time dimensions. the spectra we obtained are of course only correct at
tree-level. quantum corrections will lead to an eective potential for the brane moduli,
the minima of which will determine the nal positions of the branes and therefore
the gauge symmetry.
in the computation of the massless spectra we have implicitly
assumed that all branes of the same dimension lie on top of each other. taking quantum
corrections into account this might simply not be a minimum of the eective potential.
the analysis of [14] might suggest that maybe all non-supersymmetric models are driven
by quantum induced potentials for the moduli to supersymmetric congurations, so that
maybe all stable vacua of string theory are supersymmetric. however, in particular
for the non-supersymmetric orientifold t 6/zz2 we nd it hard to imagine a candidate
supersymmetric vacuum to which it might ow.

3. eective gauge theories on d3-branes

it was suggested in [15] to study the dynamics of non-supersymmetric gauge theories
by viewing them as eective theories arising on d3-branes in type 0b string theory.
this idea was worked out in [2], where the low energy eective action of type 0b was
computed. since this action contains a coupling of the tachyon to the square of the
rr 5-form eld strength, introducing rr 5-form ux into the background can cure the
tachyonic instability. for self-dual d3-branes the tachyon decouples and a generalized
ads-cft correspondence was established in [3] which turned out to be stable as long
as the t hooft coupling satises  = g2

y m n < 100.

aspects of type 0 string theory

the eective theory arising on n parallel self-dual d3-branes in type 0b has
gauge group su(n)su(n) and three complex bosons in the (adj, 1) and (1, adj)
representation. moreover, there arise four weyl-fermions in the (n, n) + (n, n)
representation of the gauge group.
it is easily shown that the one-loop -function
vanishes identically for this matter spectrum and the two-loop -function vanishes only
in the large n limit. thus, as expected for non-supersymmetric gauge theories the ads-
cft correspondence only tells us that the gauge theory is conformal only in the large
n limit. there are non-zero 1/n corrections which correspond to string loop corrections
to the ads5 geometry. the exact vanishing of the one-loop -function is related to the
vanishing of the annulus amplitude for self-dual d-branes in type 0b. the non-vanishing
of the two-loop -function therefore tells us, that the two loop string partition function
will be non-zero. in fact, the observation that type 0b can be regarded as an orbifold of
type iib and the general arguments given in [16] imply that all higher loop -functions
vanish in the large n limit. unfortunately, it is so far out of reach of our methods to
decide whether there exists a non-trivial xed point of the entire renormalization group
ow even for nite value of n. in the following we will study what kinds of gauge theories
one gets by taking orbifolds and orientifolds of the original model.

3.1. orbifolds

we are placing n self-dual d3-branes on a non-compact zzk orbifold. similar to the
compact case discussed in section 2 we are free to choose orbifolds preserving n=2 [17],
n=1 or even no supersymmetry at all. we compute the annulus amplitude

(6)

for self-dual d3-branes and require the absence of both linear and logarithmic ultraviolet
divergences. this leads to conditions for the action i of the symmetry on the chan-
paton factors. since we are in a non-compact setting and have the same number of d3-
and d3-branes, there arises no massless or tachyonic tadpole in the untwisted sector.
therefore there exists no restriction on 1 and the number of d3-branes is arbitrary. in
the orbifold case, the twisted tadpole conditions are simply i = 0 for i = 1, . . . , k.
explicit results can be found in [5], here we just mention the general features. since the
annulus amplitude vanishes exactly, all spectra are bose-fermi degenerated and the one-
loop -functions are zero, as well. at two loop order one encounters 1/n corrections.

moreover, all gauge groups are of the type qi su(ni)2, thus every unitary gauge group

appears twice. in order to get more general gauge groups, like single su(n) factors or
orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups, one has to consider orientifolds.

3.2. orientifolds

as in the compact case, one has to distinguish between two dierent orientifold
projections. one can consider rst non-compact orientifolds with the t-dual of the

aspects of type 0 string theory

7

 operation and second orientifolds with the t-dual of (1)fr. note, that we
need to take the t-dual operators,  = j(1)fl and   = (1)frj(1)fl with
j : z1,2,3  z1,2,3, as we are interested in eective four dimensional models and
therefore need d3-branes instead of d9-branes.

3.2.1.  orientifolds these are orientifolds by the group g + g with g = zzk. in the
compact case the untwisted rr tadpole cancellation condition forced us to introduce
anti-branes and therefore open string tachyons into the background. however in the
non-compact case there are only twisted sector rr tadpoles, which are cancelled by
choosing i = 0 for i = 1, . . . , k. therefore, there is no need to introduce anti-branes
and one gets stable gauge theories on the self-dual d3-branes. here we would like to only
discuss the easiest case with trivial g, more complicated examples can be found in [5].
for g = 1 we nd the two allowed gauge groups g=so(n) so(n) and g=sp(n)
sp(n) and three complex bosons in the (adj, 1) and (1, adj) representation. moreover,
we have four weyl-fermions in the (n, n) representation of the gauge group.
in all
orientifold models the one-loop -function of the gauge coupling vanishes only in the
large n limit, namely in this case it is b1 = 0 n  16/3. from the string theoretic point
of view this is simply due to the fact that, even though the annulus amplitude is still
vanishing, the mobius amplitude is non-zero. thus, there is a one-loop cosmological
constant generated, which causes the dilaton and therefore the gauge coupling to run.
since the mobius amplitude is 1/n suppressed against the annulus amplitude, this
running is a 1/n eect in the one-loop -function. for the two-loop -function we
obtain b2 = 64/3(n  1/2) where the n2 term vanishes. note, that b1 and b2 have
opposite sign so that there is a chance to nd a non-trivial xed point at some nite
value of g. of course, we can not prove that such a xed point really exists. going to
more general orbifold groups g does not change the general patterns mentioned above,
it only produces more general gauge and matter contents.

3.2.2.   orientifolds these are orientifolds by the group g +   g with g = zzk. one
nds the same rr-tadpole cancellation conditions as in the corresponding type iib
orientifold

tr(2k) = 

,

q3
i=1 cos(cid:0) kvi
k (cid:1)

where  denotes the generator of zzk and acts on the three complex coordinates
transversal the d3-branes as  zi  exp(2ivi/k)zi. there arises no untwisted dilaton
tadpole but there are new twisted sector nsns tadpoles. since the trace of 1 is
proportional to n and the relation (7) holds, they are 1/n suppressed. choosing the
trivial orbifold group g leads to a gauge group g=su(n), three complex bosons in the
(adj) and four weyl-fermions in the (a + a) or (s + s) representation of the gauge
group. for the one-loop -function we nd b1 = 0 n  16/3 and the two-loop -function
consistently vanishes in the large n limit. for this class of orientifolds generally one

aspects of type 0 string theory

nds an odd number of su(n) gauge factors but no orthogonal or symplectic gauge
groups.

4. conclusions

in [5, 18] the t-dual description of the models presented here was discussed. these are
the type 0a generalizations of hanany-witten set-ups including self-dual d4-branes
stretched between ns5-branes. the rules for determining the massless spectra are
easily derived and one nds as the general feature, that the one-loop -function of
the coupling in the non-supersymmetric gauge theory is the same as the one-loop -
function in the corresponding supersymmetric type iia gauge theory. it is this property
which distinguishes the type 0 models from the general class of non-supersymmetric
models discussed in [19]. it would be interesting to see how far the methods and results
derived in the supersymmetric case could be generalized to the non-supersymmetric
case at least qualitatively. in particular one would like to embed the hanany-witten
set-ups into m-theory by using the conjectured duality [20] of type 0a to m-theory on
s1/(1)fs s where s denotes the shift around the half-circle.

moreover, a better understanding of the process of tachyon condensation and which
models are related by that is desirable [21]. it was proposed in [22] to solve the gauge
hierarchy problem via conformal eld theories. the realization of this idea strongly
depends on the existence of non-trivial renormalization group xed points in non-
supersymmetric gauge theories. it would be nice if string theoretic methods could give
some new insights into the existence of such xed points.
