(3.2) (3.3) unit radius, cft describing x possesses su(2)lsu(2)r current algebra. allows us introduce two bosons: l + r, relations: l + r , e2ixl = l + l, e2ixr = r + r . (3.4) (3.5) set left-moving currents (xl, l, l) transform triplet su(2)l; similarly right-moving currents transform triplet su(2)r. (3.5) also write su(2) rotated version relations:7 e2il = xl l, e2i l = xl + il, e2ir = xr e2i r = xr + ir . r, (3.6) 7there freedom writing relations, since eq.(3.5) denes , constant shift. 10 already introduced transformation hx. introduce new trans- formation: gx : x x . (3.7) also introduce transformations g, h, g h identical manner. then, using eqs.(3.5), (3.6) see that, hx = g = g, gx = h = hg . (3.8) shall use convention open string world-sheet corresponds upper half plane spanned complex coordinate z, right-moving currents holomorphic z. operator product expansion currents given by, xr(z)xr(w) r(z)r(w) r(z) r(w) 1 2(z w)2 , (3.9) denotes equality non-singular terms. similar relations involving left-moving currents. since d-strings stretched along x, impose neumann boundary condi- tion x: (xl)b = (xr)b 1 2 xb , (3.10) subscript b denotes boundary value. using eq.(3.5) translates neu- mann boundary condition : (l)b = (r)b 1 2 b, ( l)b = ( r)b 1 2 b . vertex operator mode tn+ 1 2 dened (2.4) given by: vn+ 1 2 = ie2i(n+ 1 2 )xb 1 . thus vertex operator (t 1 2 + 1 2 ) given by: vs = i(eixb + eixb ) 1 = ib 1 .

(3.17) eq.(3.17) restated saying h quantum number state multiplied factor: exp(i ) . (3.18) 2 using identication h gx (eq.(3.8)) fact open string spectrum gx projection, see switching tachyon vev, open string states cp factor contains h even h odd states. = 2, then, seen eq.(3.18), h quantum numbers get multiplied 1. means complete spectrum open strings cp sector remains unchanged. thus bcft = 2 equivalent = 0, conclude periodic variable period 2. although critical radius r = rc, values describe consistent bcft, anticipation results next section let us pay special attention spectrum = 1. begin tabulating h g eigenvalues various open string states = 0: 12 cp factors gx = h hx = g 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 table 1: spectrum = 0 = 1, quantum numbers sectors 1 remain unchanged, h eigenvalues sectors 3 i2 get multiplied i. thus table modied to: cp factors h = hg g = g 1 2 3 table 2: spectrum = 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 combining open string spectrum sectors see fock space, g projection, momentum form: p = n 2 , n z , allowed. let us dene new eld related t-duality transformation: l = l, r = r , (3.19) (3.20) w denotes winding charge along (dened /2), g denotes transformation , relations: p = w, g = g .

(4.3) (4.4) w measures total winding charge carried closed string vertex operators inserted interior. since exp(2i(l + r)) w = 0, whereas exp(2i(l r)) w = 2, rewrite (4.3) 1 2 (sin )d(cid:16)e2i(lr) e2i(lr)(cid:17)(p )b(q)e . (4.5) using fact satises neumann boundary condition, one easily show correlation function appearing (4.5) non-zero. shows one point function r > rc non-zero. vanishes = 0 = 1, stated earlier. shall focus attention = 1 point, analyse general correla- tion function open string vertex operators general radius r. would require summing arbitrary number insertions vr appropriate weight factors. thus typical correlation function analysed form: dyi v open(qi)ym vr(pm) exp(cid:16)i 2 w1(cid:17)e , (4.6) 8ghost number conservation requires also insert appropriate number ghost elds vertex operators. correlation function factors matter part ghost part, non- trivial information comes analysing matter part. hence focus matter part correlator. 15 w dened eq.(4.4). qi points boundary world- sheet pm points interior. eect exponential factor open string vertex operators shift momentum, already taken account previous section. thus interprete w appearing (4.6) sum winding charges closed string vertex operators inserted interior. expressing vr vr = 1 4(cid:16)e2i(l+r) + e2i(l+r) + e2i(lr) + e2i(lr)(cid:17) , (4.7) see rst two terms carry w = 0 whereas third fourth terms carry w = 2. since terms w even, relation: exp(i 2 w1) = (1)w/2 . transforms vr given (4.7) 1 4(cid:16)e2i(l+r) + e2i(l+r) e2i(l r) e2i(lr)(cid:17) = l r = l r , (4.8) (4.9) l dened eq.(3.20). perturbing operator r eect increasing radius (or, equivalently, decreasing radius). thus see eect increasing r presence tachyon background achieved increasing radius proportion, ignoring tachyon background. since r = rc = 1 2, open string spectrum corresponds d-particle circle radius 1 2, would correspond d-particle circle radius 1 2 = r. r , corresponds d-particle (25+1) dimensional minkowski space. 2 , see increase r 1 proves equivalence bcft describing tachyonic kink solution pair d-strings, describing d-particle. note marginal deformation interpolating two congurations involve elds x 0, . . . x 24 step. thus putting neumann boundary condition (p1) elds x 1, . . . x 24 make initial conguration pair d-p-branes, nal conguration d-(p 1)-brane. 16 ~ 0 - r~ x ~ r2 figure 4: tachyon eld d-string produces pair d-particles. 5 d-particle tachyonic lump single d- string? following ref.{$9812031$}, study t-dual version analysis.9 case massless mode tachyon interpolates pair d-particles situated diametrically radius. running marginal ow backwards, conclude tachyon opposite points circle radius er = 2, single d-string wrapped circle condensation d-string circle radius er produces pair d-particles diametrically opposite points circle. point view d-string, particular mode condenses corresponds to: et (x) = e cos x = e cos , (5.1) 2x er et tachyonic eld living d-string. plotted fig.4. viewed pair lumps circle, one spanning range 0 x er, spanning range er x 2er. although conguration symmetric et et (together translation along x), symmetry destroyed interactions taken account. 9many results section discussed earlier refs.. 17 ev (et0) + t1 = 0 . relation guarantees lump nite mass. ~ ~ 0 suggests identify single d-particle 26 dimensional minkowski space tachyonic lump innite d-string shown fig.5. gure et0 denotes minimum tachyonic potential ev (et ) satisfying, (5.2) x figure 5: tachyonic lump d-string, representing single d-particle. analysis generalised starting d-string compactied circle radius n integer n (including 1), condensing mode proportional cos x. produce n lumps circle, identied n uniformly spaced d-particles circle radius n. 6 reconciling two dierent descriptions d- branes analysis previous sections suggests two dierent ways viewing d0-brane (d-(p 1)-brane), kink d-string anti-d-string (d-p-brane anti-d-p-brane) pair, also lump single d-string (d-p-brane). section shall show reinterprete results sections 3 4 way second 18 description explain results paper. let us denote fl(x) function shown fig.5. thus single d1-brane, conguration denotes d0-brane. hand, et = et0 denotes vacuum solution. thus bt denotes 2 2 matrix valued tachyon eld pair coincident d-branes, conguration: et (x) = fl(x) bt (x) = (cid:18) et0 fl(x)(cid:19) (6.1) (6.2) (6.3) denote single d0-brane.
