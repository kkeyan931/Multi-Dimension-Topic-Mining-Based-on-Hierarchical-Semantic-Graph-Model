abstract

we study static spherically symmetric monopole solutions in non-abelian
einstein-born-infeld-higgs model with normal trace structure. these monopo-
les are similar to the corresponding solution with symmetrised trace structure
and are existing only up to some critical value of the strength of the gravita-
tional interaction. in addition, similar to their at space counterpart, they also
admit a critical value of the born-infeld parameter .

the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) model[1, 2] has recently received special considera-
tion in connection with string theory and d-brane dynamics[3, 4] after the discovery
that the low energy eective action for d-branes is precisely described by the dbi
action [5]-[7] (for a review see [8] ). bps solutions to dbi theory for gauge elds and
scalars were then studied and interpreted in terms of branes pulled by strings [9]-[12].
dierent non-abelian generalization of the dbi action have been proposed [13]-
[15]. they dier in the way a scalar action is dened from objects carrying group
indices. the use of a symmetrised trace proposed by tesytlin [14] in the context of
superstring theory seems to be the natural one in connection with supersymmetry
and leads to a linearized lagrangian with bps equations identical to yang-mills ones
[16]-[18]. the use of the ordinary trace and other recipes for dening the dbi action
have been also investigated [15].

vortex, monopole and other soliton-like solutions to theories containing a dbi
action have been studied for abelian and non-abelian gauge symmetry [19]-[23], in
this last case both using the symmetrised and the normal trace operation to de-
ne a scalar dbi action. a distinctive feature was discovered for dbi vortices and
monopoles: there exists a critical value c of the born-infeld -parameter below which
regular solutions cease to exist [20]-[22]. in the non-abelian case, this critical value
can be tested only when the normal trace is adopted since, for the symmetrised trace,
the lagrangian is known only as a perturbative series in 1/ and the results are valid
outside the domain where -criticality takes place.

the existence of c is much resemblant to the phenomenon occuring for self-
gravitating monopoles [24]-[32], that exhibit a critical behavior with respect to the
strength of the gravitational interaction: above some maximum value of a parameter
, related to the strength of gravitational interaction, regular monopole solutions
collapse. this behavior, originally described in einstein-yang-mills-higgs theory, has
been shown to take place also when the dbi action governs the dynamics of the gauge
eld [33, 34]. since the symmetric trace has been adopted in these last references,
the existence of c in dbi theories coupled to gravity could not be analysed; it is the
purpose of the present work to address this issue, namely, to study the einstein-dbi-
higgs model using the normal trace for dening the dbi action, nd self-gravitating
monopole solutions, determine whether they cease to exist below some critical value
c as in the at space case and, in the armative, study the interplay between  and
c.

we consider the following einstein-born-infeld-higgs action for su(2) elds with

the higgs eld in the adjoint representation

s = z d4xg [lg + lbi + lh ]

with

lg =

and the trace tr in lagrangian (2) is dened so that tr(tatb) = ab.

here we are interested in purely magnetic congurations, hence we have f f  =
0. the elementary excitations are a massless photon, two massive charged vec-
tors bosons with mass mw = ev, and a massive neutral higgs scalar with mass
mh = 2gev. varying the action with respect to the matric we obtain the following
expression for the energy-momentum tensor

for static spherical symmetric solutions, the metric can be parametrized as[26, 35]

ds2 = e2(r)dt2 + e2(r)dr2 + r2(r)(d2 + sin2 d2)

we consider the t hooft-polyakov ansatz for the gauge and scalar elds

putting the above ansatz in eq.1, dening 2 = 4gv2 and rescaling r  r/ev,
r(r)  r(r)/ev and   ev2 we get the following expression for the lagrangian

here the prime denotes dierentiation with respect to r. the dimensionless param-

where mp l = 1/g is the planck mass. as expected in the limit of    the above

action reduces to that of the einstein-yang-mills-higgs model. also, the limit  = 0,

for which we must have (r) = 0 = (r) corresponds to the at space born-infeld-
higgs theory[21]. note that the use of the normal trace allowed to reaccomodate the
lagrangian in terms of a square root without reference to the gauge group generators;
this is not possible for the case of the symmetyrized trace.

from now on we consider the gauge r(r) = r, corresponding to the schwarzschild-
like coordinates and rename r = r. we dene a = e+ and n = e2. integrating
the tt component of the energy-momentum we get the mass of the monopole equal
to m/evg where

note that the eld a can be elliminated from the matter eld equations using eq.(12).
now we consider the globally regular solution to the above equations. expanding
the elds in powers of r and keeping the leading order terms we obtain the following
expressions near the origin

h = ar + o(r3),
w = 1  br2 + o(r4),
n = 1  cr2 + o(r4)

then the gauge and the higgs elds has the following behaviour in the asymptotically

we solved the equations of motion numerically using the above boundary condi-
tions. the solutions are pretty much the same as those for the case of the symmerised
trace[33] for   1 and they agree with the corresponding solution for the yang-mills-
higgs case for lagre  [27, 26]. for a denite value of , the solution exists up to some
critical value max of the parameter . the minima of the metric function decreases
as we increase the value of  for  < max and it approches zero for   max. the
solution does not exist for  > max. it is observed that when we decrease the value
of  the max goes on increaseing. the values of max for dierent  are given in
table 1. however it is also found that, similar to the at space monopoles[21] there is
a critical value c for nite , and the solutions does not exist for  < c. for  = 1
and g = 0 we nd c  0.1 which is much smaller than the corresponding value for
at space which is approximately 0.5. the prole for dierent values of ,  for the
case of g = 0 are given in the figs.1, 2&3.

to understand these results, let us recall that the existence of an upper bound
max for the gravitation strength can be interpreted by observing that monopole
mass/radius ratio increases as  increases so that max can be seen as the value at
which the monopole becomes gravitationally unstable and collapses [24]-[31]. this
for yang-mills action, which corresponds to the    limit of dbi action. now,
as  decreases from its limiting value, the mass of the monopole decreases (see table
max > =max , as observed in our
2) so that the collapse should occur for a value 
solutions. the same kind of analysis can be performed regarding the lowering of c
as  increases: as shown in [20]-[22], the singular behavior occuring at c manifests
as an abrupt descent in the soliton mass, a phenomenon which is in concurrence with
the enhancing of the mass as  grows. that is the reason why 

.

in summary, we analysed the gravitating monopole solutions in non-abelian born-
infeld-higgs system with a normal trace structure. the solutions exist up to some
critical value c of the born-infeld parameter  below which there is no solution. it
was not possible to study this feature in the corresponding model with symmetrised
trace structure since the perturbative expansion implicit in this case is not valid for

small . we also found that the parameter  has some maximum allowed value max
for a denite . this max increases as we decrease . it would be worth studying
if the similar behaviour occures in case of non-abelian black holes. also it should
be possible to study the dyon solutions in the non-abelian model with normal trace
structure.
