abstract

we consider the ads/cft correspondence for theories with a chern-simons
term in three dimensions. we nd the two-point functions of the boundary
conformal eld theories for the proca-chern-simons theory and the self-dual
model. we also discuss particular limits where we nd the two-point function of
the boundary conformal eld theory for the maxwell-chern-simons theory. in
particular our results are consistent with the equivalence between the maxwell-
chern-simons theory and the self-dual model.

1 introduction

since the proposal of maldacenas conjecture that the large n limit of a certain con-
formal eld theory (cft) in a d-dimensional space is a boundary theory of string/m
theory on adsd+1  k (where k is a suitable compact space) [1], an intensive work
has been devoted to understand all of its implications. in particular, a precise form to
the conjecture has been given in [2][3]. their suggestion is that the partition function
for a eld theory on adsd+1, considered as the functional of the asymptotic value of
the eld on the boundary, is the generating functional for the correlation functions in
the cft on the boundary. schematically,

zads[0] = z0 d exp (i[])  zcf t [0] = (cid:28)exp(cid:18)z

ddxo0(cid:19)(cid:29)

(1)

where 0 is the boundary value of  which couples to the boundary cft operator o.
this allows us to obtain the correlation functions of the boundary cft theory in d
dimensions by calculating the partition function on the adsd+1 side.

the ads/cft correspondence has been studied for scalar elds [4], massive vector
elds [5][6], spinor elds [5][7][8], rarita-schwinger eld [9], classical gravity [10] and
type iib string theory [11][12]. in this work we discuss the ads3/cf t2 correspondence
for vector eld theories including a chern-simons term. in section 2 we deal with the
proca-chern-simons theory. an explicit expression for the two-point function of the
boundary cft is obtained. we then study the massless limit to obtain the two-point
function for the maxwell-chern-simons theory [13]. in section 3 we deal with the self-
dual model [14]. since the standard self-dual action has at most rst order derivatives
it vanishes on-shell. also the variational principle requires a surface term in order to
have a stationary action [15]. as in the case involving spinors [5][7][8][9] the only
contribution to the boundary cft comes from a surface term. an expression for the
two-point function on the border is then obtained. there is a well known equivalence
between the self-dual model and the maxwell-chern-simons theory [16]. we nd that
the resulting two-point functions of the corresponding boundary cfts are consistent
with this equivalence. finally section 4 presents our conclusions.

2 the proca-chern-simons theory

since we are going to consider the euclidean version of ads3 we start with the euclidean
signature action for the proca-chern-simons theory which is given by

ip cs = z d3xg  1

(2)

where f = a  a and  is the levicivita tensor density with 012 = 1.
using the variational principle to obtain the eld equations a surface term is generated

z d3x (cid:18)

gf a + i


8

aa + c.c.(cid:19) .

(3)

we will choose coordinates such that the minkowski border of ads3 is situated at
x0 = 0. then the boundary term eq.(3) will depend only on variations of the spatial
components ai of the vector potential. choosing boundary conditions only on the ais
makes the boundary term to vanish so that no further surface terms need to be added
to the action eq.(2). this kind of consideration will play a fundamental role in the
next section.

the eld equations which follow from eq.(2) are

f   m2a  i

1
g

a = 0,

which implies

a = 0.

(4)

(5)

solving eqs.(4,5) in the ads3 background is dicult due to the presence of the levi
civita tensor density. however it can be eliminated in the following way. using eq.(5)
in eq.(4) we get

(cid:18)2  m2 

r

3(cid:19) a  if  = 0,

(6)

where f  = 1

eq.(4) by the levicivita tensor density and using again eq.(5) we get

1g f and r is the scalar curvature of ads3. now multiplying

(cid:18)2  m2  2 

r

3(cid:19) f  + im2a = 0.

(7)

finally eliminating f  from eqs.(6,7) we arrive at

(cid:18)2  m2
+ 

r

3(cid:19)(cid:18)2  m2
 

r

3(cid:19) a = 0,

where

(11)

in the at space limit this is an indication that the proca-chern-simons theory de-
scribes two excitations with masses m [17]. we notice that the solutions of eq.(8)
must satisfy

or

(cid:18)2  m2
+ 
(cid:18)2  m2
 

r

3(cid:19) a = 0,
3(cid:19) a = 0.

r

therefore the general solution of eq.(8) is a superposition of solutions of the proca
theory with masses m+ and m. the proca theory has been analyzed in [5] and we
now follow closely the derivation in that paper.

we take the usual representation of the ads3 described by the half space x0 > 0,

xi  r with metric

ds2 =

1
x2
0

2

x=0

dxdx,

(12)

for which the curvature scalar is r = 6. as in [5] we also introduce vector potentials
with lorentz indices a using the vielbein of ads3

the solutions which are regular at x0   can be written as

a = x0a.

a =

~x = (x1, x2), k =| ~k |, km are the modied bessel functions, and from now on m
is to be understood as | m |. the normalization in eq.(14) has been chosen so that
it reproduces the results in [5] in the particular case  = 0 (and hence a+ = a).
inserting eqs.(15,16) in the original equations of motion eq.(4) gives the following
relations among the coecients a

mai (~k) = im0ijaj (~k),

from eq.(5) we also nd

ma0 (~k)(cid:16)0ijkj  iki(cid:17) = ik20ijaj (~k).

(17)

(18)

(19)
which is consistent with eq.(18). we consider rst the case  6= 0,m 6= 0 and rewrite
eqs.(17) and (18) as
(20)

ikiai (~k) = ma0 (~k),

ai (~k) = i0ijaj (~k),

ma0 (~k)(cid:16)iki + 0ijkj(cid:17) =  k2 ai (~k).

in order to capture the eect of the minkowski boundary of the ads3, situated at
x0 = 0, we rst consider a dirichlet boundary value problem on the boundary surface
x0 =  > 0 and then take the limit   0. the potential at the near boundary surface
will be denoted by a,. imposing the near boundary condition on eqs.(15,16) and
using eqs.(20,21) allow us to nd the coecients a in terms of the fourier transform
of the elds a,i

using this we can nally calculate the value of the classical action in the near boundary
surface using the action eq.(2). after an integration by parts and using the equations
of motion we nd that there is only a contribution from the boundary

ip cs =

which evaluated on the near boundary surface gives

ip cs =

using eqs.(20,23,25,27), keeping only the relevant terms in the series expansion of the
bessel functions, and integrating over the momenta we get

then we use the equivalence ads/cft in the form

exp (iads)  (cid:28)exp(cid:18)z d2x ji(~x) a0,i(~x)(cid:19)(cid:29) .

(33)

when  < 0 we have m(m, |  |) 1 = m+(m, ) 1, the relevant part of i vanishes
and the only contribution to the two-point function of the conformal eld j p cs
on the
boundary cft comes from i +. when  > 0 we have m(m, |  |) 1 = m(m, ) 1,
comes from i. in both
and the only contribution to the two-point function of j p cs

so that j p cs
cation eq.(32) agrees with the requirement that the isometries of ads3 correspond to
the conformal isometries in cf t2 [18].

cp cs = c(m, |  |),

now we consider the particular cases m = 0 and  = 0. in order to get the boundary
cft associated to the maxwell-chern-simons theory we take m = 0 in eq.(9), which
gives

chern-simons theory describes a particle with mass  [13] and this fact is reected
in the conformal dimension eq.(39). furthermore, our result is consistent with the
holographic principle since the mass m(0,|  |) = 0 is not physical in the bulk [13]
and does not contribute to the border two-point function.
the proca theory has been considered in [5] and we derive here the main results for

which is written in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the vector potential. since
the eld equations derived from eq.(48) are rst order dierential equations we can
not choose boundary conditions which x simultaneously the real and imaginary parts
of the ais. then we choose boundary conditions on the ar
i s leaving a non-vanishing
term proportional to the ai

4 conclusions

as expected from the holographic principle the conformal dimensions depend only on
the masses of the corresponding theories in the bulk. although the solutions in the
bulk expressed in terms of the boundary values have a complicated form the boundary
twopoint functions are very simple as dictated by conformal invariance. in fact for
each theory we could have just solved the corresponding proca equations and used this
solution to nd the twopoint function on the border. the nal result is insensitive to
the detailed structure in the bulk.

another manifestation of the holographic principle is the fact that in the massless
limit the proca-chern-simons theory gives rise to only one massive excitation of mass
|| and the massless mode becomes unphysical. this is reected in the border cft
where the two-point function eq.(42) has a contribution only from the massive mode
of the bulk theory.

the equivalence between the self-dual model and the maxwell-chern-simons the-
ory in at space-time is well known [16] and it can easily be shown to be true also
in curved space-time either at the level of the equations of motion or by dening a
master lagrangian in curved space-time. the fact that we obtain the same conformal
dimension for the corresponding cfts in the border is in support of the holographic
principle. not only the conformal dimensions are the same but the coecients c of
the two-point functions can be made the same by an appropriate normalization of the
self-dual action. since we started with two independent parameters in eq.(48) we can
now choose m = || so that the model describes a particle with mass m. now our
results have an universal form in which the conformal dimension and the two-point
function coecient can be written as  = m + 1 and c = m/ respectively, where m
is the mass of the bulk theory.
