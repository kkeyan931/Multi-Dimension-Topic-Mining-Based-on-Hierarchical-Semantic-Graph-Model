abstract

i review the computation of the conformal anomaly of a wilson surface observable in free two-form

gauge theory in six dimensions.

m -theory admits congurations with some number n of coincident ve-branes embedded in a curved
eleven-dimensional space. small uctuations around this conguration are described by a (0, 2) supercon-
formal eld theory dened on the six-dimensional world-volume m of the branes, and with a background
metric g given by the embedding. there is a conformally invariant observable w () associated with
every two-cycle  in m . when n = 1, this theory is simply given by a free (0, 2) tensor multiplet, i.e.
a two-form b with self-dual eld strength, eight spinors i and ve scalars a, and the observable
associated with a two-cycle  is given by the exponential of the integral of b over :

hw ()i = (cid:28)exp 2iz

b(cid:29) .

(1)

for nite n , the theory is a dicult to study interacting superconformal eld theory, about which
rather little is known. for large n , however, there is a holographic description by a weakly coupled
supergravity theory on an open seven-manifold x such that x = m . the expectation value of the
observable associated with a two-cycle  is then given by the exponential of the volume of an embedded
minimal open three-manifold d such that d = :

hw ()i = exp 2izd

vd,

(2)

where vd is the volume form on d.

the theory itself, and also the observable w () for an arbitrary two-cycle , are invariant under

conformal rescalings of the background metric g . formally, the quantity

i = 

1
42 log hw ()i

(3)

is therefore conformally invariant. however, i diverges and needs to be regularized. by adding local
counterterms, we can cancel the divergences and obtain a nite in. this procedure can be carried out in
a manifestly covariant way, but conformal invariance is in general lost. under a conformal transformation

with innitesimal parameter function , in transforms as

g = 2g

in = 42z

(5)

where g is the determinant of the induced metric g on , and the conformal or weyl anomaly a is
given by some local expression linear in .
by the wess-zumino consistency conditions, the conformal variation of the anomaly a is a total

derivative. it follows that a must be a linear combination of the terms

for large n , the anomaly a was calculated in [1] by generalizing the computation in [2] with the

with an arbitrary non-zero constant  multiplying the gauge xing term. apart from this term, the action
is conformally invariant, which means that the conformal variation of the propagator ;(x, x ) is a
total derivative. the same is true for its pullback ;(, ) to an embedded two-cycle , i.e.

;(, ) = [];(, ) + [

||;](, )

(10)

for some ;(, ) and 
metric. it follows that the quantity

;(, ) that are linear in the parameter  of a conformal variation of the

is formally invariant under a conformal transformation.

however, ;(, ) diverges along the diagonal of , so i is not really well dened. we therefore

consider the regulated quantity

i = z

d  d z

d  d(s2(, )  2);(, ),

(12)

where (t) is the step function, s2(, ) is the square of the geodesic distance and  > 0 is a cuto. we
expect that

i = 2i2 + log  i0 + in + o(),

(13)

where the coecients i2 and i0 of the divergent terms are given by some local expressions that can be
cancelled by counterterms so that we are left with the nite quantity in. this regularization breaks
conformal invariance, and under a conformal variation we expect that

where a = in is the conformal anomaly. on the other hand, we have that

i = 2a2 + a + o(),

i = z

where s2(, ) denotes the conformal variation of the geodesic distance.

we see from the above that i, and thus the anomaly, can be calculated just from a knowledge of
the short distance expansion of the propagator, the geodesic distance and their conformal variations. in
riemann normal coordinates around x  and with x  = x  + x , these are given by

the computations are most easily performed by introducing riemann normal coordinates (with re-
spect to the induced metric) on  as well. the delta function in (15) reduces the integral over d2  to a
one-dimensional integral, which is elementary. we are then left with an expression integrated over d2
only. the end result is that

i =

we note that the quadratic divergence indeed can be cancelled by a local counterterm, which in fact is
just the area of . there is also a logarithmic divergence in i (but not in i) which is likewise given by
a local expression. finally, we point out that a is not proportional to the large n anomaly computed in
[1].
