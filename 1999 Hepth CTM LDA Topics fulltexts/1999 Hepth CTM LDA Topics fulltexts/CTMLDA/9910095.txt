(1) anti-commutator left- right-handed supercharges receives contribution central charges yk, k = 1, 2, 3 {q, q } = 2( p + k yk), (2) p, = 0, , 3 energy-momentum four-vector system. hermiticity supercharges dictates central charges zk complex, yk real: (yk) = yk. central charges come total divergence non-vanishing nontrivial dierences asymptotic behavior dierent region spatial innity case domain walls junctions. therefore charges topological sense determined completely boundary conditions innity. instance, compute anticommutators (1), (2) general wess-zumino models arbitrary number chiral superelds arbitrary superpotential w . contributions central charges bosonic components chiral superelds given zk = 2z d3x kw (a), yk = iknmz d3x kij n(ajmai), 123 = 1, (3) (4) scalar component i-th chiral supereld denoted ai kahler metric kij = 2k(a, a)/aiaj obtained kahler potential k. see central charge zk completely determined dierence values superpotential w spatial innities dierent discrete vacua chosen dierent directions. since single domain wall eld conguration nontrivial one dimension, one see eq.(4) central charge yk vanishes whereas central charge zk non-vanishing. central charge yk non-vanishing, eld conguration innity nontrivial two-dimensions. situation occurs three dierent vacua occur innity case domain wall junctions. examine lower bound energy due hermiticity supercharges, consider hermitian linear combination operators q q arbitrary complex two- vector complex conjugate = () coecients k = q + q . (5) 3 treat c-numbers rather grassmann numbers. since k hermitian, expectation value square k state non-negative denite hs|k 2|si ( 1, 2, 1, 2) k 2 1 2 1 2 0. (6) equality holds linear combination supercharges k preserved state |si. since interested eld congurations rest, obtain p k = 0, (k = 1, 2, 3) matrix k 2 terms central charges zk, yk hamiltonian h explicitly k 2 = hz2 iz1i hiz3i hh + y3i hy1 iy2i hiz3i hz2 + iz1i hy1 + iy2i hh y3i hh + y3i hy1 + iy2i hz2 + iz1i hiz3i hy1 iy2i hh y3i hiz3i hz2 iz1i . (7) simplicity, let us assume eld conguration two-dimensional, instance, depends x1, x2 only. obtain hz3i = hy1i = hy2i = 0. inequality (6) implies case state 1 hhi | 1|2 + | 2|2(cid:26)(| 1|2 | 2|2)hy3i + re(cid:2)( 1)2hz2 iz1i(cid:3) + re(cid:2)( 2)2hz2 + iz1i(cid:3)(cid:27). (8) (9) minimum energy achieved larger one vanishing eigenvalues matrix k 2 det( k 2) = (hh + y3i2 |hiz1 z2i|2)(hh y3i2 |hiz1 z2i|2) = 0. thus bps bound becomes hhi max{hi, hii} hi hii two solutions eq.(9) (10) corresponding eigenvectors given 1 = 1hiz1 + z2i/|hiz1 + z2i|, 2 = 2 = 0 hhi = hi 1 = 1 = 0, 2 = 2hiz1 + z2i/|hiz1 + z2i| hhi = hii . hi |hiz1 z2i| hy3i, hii |hiz1 z2i| + hy3i. hi > hii, supersymmetry preserved hhi = hi one combination supercharges conserved (cid:18)q1 + hiz1 + z2i |hiz1 + z2i| q 1(cid:19)|bpsi = 0. (11) hii > hi, supersymmetry preserved hhi = hii one combi- nation supercharges conserved (cid:18)q2 + hiz1 + z2i |hiz1 + z2i| q 2(cid:19)|bpsi = 0. 4 (12) cases correspond 1/4 bps state. two eigenvalues degenerate hi = hii, 1/2 bps state h = hi = hii two combinations supercharges (11) (12) conserved. condition supercharge conservation (11) h = hi applied chiral supereld = (ai, i, f i) gives eliminating auxiliary eld f 2ikij hiz1 + z2i |hiz1 + z2i|dzai = w aj , (13) 1 complex coordinates z = x1 + ix2, z = x1 ix2, gauge covariant derivatives d, dz = 2(d1 + id2) dz = 1 2 (d1 id2) introduced. bps condition (11) applied u(1) vector supereld wess-zumino gauge v = (v, , d) gives eliminating auxiliary eld 1 2 xj v12 = = ajejaj, v03 = 0, v01 = v31, v23 = v02, (14) v v v ej charge eld aj. similar condition holds case non-abelian gauge group. similarly condition supercharge conservation (12) h = hii applied chiral super- eld gives eliminating auxiliary eld 2ikij hiz1 z2i |hiz1 z2i|dzai = w aj . bps condition (12) applied u(1) vector supereld wess-zumino gauge gives v12 = = 1 2 xj ajejaj, v03 = 0, v01 = v31, v23 = v02. (15) (16) bps conditions (13) (14) h = hi (15) (16) h = hii ensure conguration bps saturated. since hzki hyki given total divergence shown eqs.(3) (4), xed boundary condition spatial innity. therefore boundary condition determines supercharges preserved (11) and/or (12). since bps states minimum energy solution given boundary condition innity, stable uctuations preserving boundary condition. domain wall minimum energy stable long two dierent vacua occupy order r region boundary large radius r. domain wall junction also minimum energy stable provided three (or more) vacua remain regions order r . model many eld theory models bps domain wall junction solutions. first example wess-zumino model single chiral scalar eld polynomial superpotential 5 w = 2 1 n+12nn+1, n integer 2 parameter dimension mass. model n discrete supersymmetric vacua vanishing vacuum energy. therefore one domain wall solutions n 2 , junction solutions n 3  {$9905217$}, interpolating among vacua. numerical studies performed domain walls junctions models {$9907066$}. however, explicit analytic solution found even domain walls, apart simplest case n = 2 kink solution known sometime. explicit solution found dicult problem junctions. another example n = 1 supersymmetric qcd nf avor quarks funda- mental representation. case su(nc) gauge group, nc nf discrete supersym- metric vacua {$9905165$}, domain wall solutions {$9905165$}. model also obtained n = 2 supersymmetric qcd perturbing mass term adjoint chiral su- pereld. reduces n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory innite mass limit, whereas ends singular points moduli space n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory limit vanishing adjoint mass . moduli space n = 2 su(2) supersymmetric yang-mills theory two singularities monopole dyon becomes massless respectively . order discuss model simpler setting, kaplunovsky et. al. proposed toy model treated local eld theory . introduced two pairs chiral superelds m, d, simulating monopole, anti-monopole dyon, anti-dyon seiberg-witten theory respectively. instead modulus u seiberg-witten theory, introduced linearized analogue neutral chiral supereld. gauge group chosen u(1) u(1) simulating electric magnetic gauge group quantum number chiral superelds given u(1) u(1) 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 (17) mimic massless monopole = massless dyon = , consider superpotential (18) coupling parameter h2 replaces eect mass adjoint chiral supereld. model two discrete n = 1 supersymmetric vacua w = (t )m + (t + )d h2t, = +, = h2, = , = h2, |m| = | m|, = = 0, |d| = | d|, = = 0. (19) simplicity, assumed kahler metric model discussed domain wall solution interpolating two vacua. special case h2 = 22, obtained analytic solution domain wall asymptotes vacuum = + x vacuum = x + (19): 1 + e2x , 1 + e2x , = = = tanh x. = = (20) h h also studied domain wall general values coupling h2 6= 22 numerically found qualitative features unchanged. 6 add single avor quarks fundamental representation n = 2 su(2) gauge theory, obtain three singularities moduli space. large bare mass quark, additional singularity corresponds situation eective mass quark vanishes, whereas z3 symmetry among three singularities realized limit vanishing bare quark mass . three singularities become three discrete vacua n = 1 gauge theory perturbed adjoint scalar mass . view features, extend u(1)u(1) model ref. adding additional pair chiral superelds q, q corresponding quark anti-quark q q 1 1 0 0 u(1) u(1) (21) make quark massless = bare mass parameter quark q, superpotential extended w = (t )m + (t + )d + (t m)q q h2t. (22) simple modication produces model possesses three distinct n = 1 supersymmetric vacua allows us obtain exact solution junctions. since action invariant three global u(1) transformations ei1m, ei1 m, ei2d, choose vacuum conguration ei2 d, q ei3q, q ei3 q, vac.1 : = m, q = q = h, = = = = 0, vac.2 : = , = = h, q = q = = = 0, vac.3 : = , = = h, q = q = = = 0. (23) (24) consider eld conguration static translationally invariant along x3 direction. assume three dierent vacua realized dierent directions spatial innity x1, x2 plane. solution states saturated bogomolnyi bound obey eqs.

(25) z3 symmetric case vanishing bare quark mass seiberg-witten theory yields dierent charge assignment third singularity (nm, ne) = (1, 2) instead (nm, ne) = (0, 1) . even use charge assignment q eld, vanishing term condition gives result. w aj , = hiz1 + z2i |hiz1 + z2i| 7 look solution partial dierential equation. observe phase absorbed rotation eld conguration, since bps equation (25) invariant phase rotation : ei, z eiz. later, check solution satises hii > hi. since assume canonical kahler metric kij = ij, bps eqs.

(27) (28) arbitrary complex parameters h obtained real-positive h phase changes. therefore shall take h real-positive following without loss generality. bps condition = 0 yields |m(z, z)| = | m(z, z)|, |d(z, z)| = | d(z, z)|, |q(z, z)| = | q(z, z)|. inspired condition, wish nd solution assuming m(z, z) = m(z, z), d(z, z) = d(z, z), q(z, z) = q(z, z). real-positive entire complex plane. shall see ansatz gives consistent solution. note model acquires z3 symmetry choose bare mass q = i3.
