introduction

at present, the most promising candidates of models unifying the four known
fundamental interactions consist of string theories [1, 2]. as their name
indicates, the fundamental objects of these theories are strings and it is
believed that all the particles found in nature can be viewed as their dierent
vibration modes. at the lowest end of their energy spectrum, string theories
contain states which can be described by antisymmetric tensor elds. these
elds are therefore essential ingredients of various supergravity models which
represent low energy approximations of string theories. the study of these
elds is thus an important question of theoretical and mathematical physics.
antisymmetric tensor elds, denoted b1...p, generalize the vector po-
tential a used to describe maxwells theory of electromagnetism. they are
antisymmetric with respect to the permutation of any two of their indices
and are thus naturally viewed as the components of a p-form,

b =

1
p!

b1...ndx1  . . .  dxp.

(1.1)

as in the case of electromagnetism, the action of massless p-form gauge
theories is invariant under gauge transformations. for maxwells theory, the
gauge transformations read, a  a + where  is an arbitrary spacetime
in form notation, this symmetry is written as a = adx 
function.
a + d where d = dx is the spacetime exterior derivative. the gauge
transformations of p-form gauge elds are straightforward generalization of
the above transformations and are given by, b  b + d where  is now
an arbitrary spacetime dependent p  1-form. their is however a signicant
dierence. the gauge transformations of p-forms (p > 1) are reducible, i.e,
they are not all independent. indeed the gauge parameters  and  =  + d
where  is a p  2-form produce the same transformation of b by virtue of
d2 = 0. as we shall see later, this is one of the particularities of p-form gauge

introduction

theories which makes their study a rich problem.

the aim of this thesis is to study some of the properties of p-form gauge
theories by using the brst eld-antield formalism. the essential ingredient
of this formalism is the brst dierential s which was rst discovered in the
context of the quantization of yang-mills theory. as for any gauge theory, it
is necessary when quantizing yang-mills theory to introduce a gauge xing
term in the action in order to obtain well-dened propagators and green
functions. furthermore one must ensure that the measurable quantities cal-
culated from the gauge xed action do not depend on the choice of the gauge
xation and that the theory is unitary in the physical sector. an elegant
way of achieving this program for yang-mills theory was devised by faddeev
and popov [3]. their method requires the introduction of new elds, called
ghosts which only appear as intermediate states in transition amplitudes.

becchi, rouet, stora [4, 5] and tyutin [6] then discovered that the gauge-
xed yang-mills action incorporating the ghosts was invariant under a nilpo-
tent symmetry, the brst symmetry, which was then extended to theories
with more general gauge structures [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and in particular to
reducible gauge theories. the most important property of the brst sym-
metry is that for any gauge theory it allows one to construct an extended
action which guarantees at the quantum level all the conditions recalled in
the preceding paragraph.

another benet of the brst symmetry is that one can study various
problems of classical and quantum eld theory by calculating the local coho-
mology h(s|d) of its nilpotent generator s; this amounts to the classication
of the non-trivial solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition [12].
in quantum eld theory, the local brst cohomology is especially useful
in renormalization theory. indeed, one can show that in ghost number 1
(see section 2.1), h(s|d) contains all the candidate gauge anomalies which
can arise upon quantization of a gauge theory. the existence of these brst
cocycles does not imply that the theory is anomalous. however, a calcula-
tion of their coecients indicates if the theory is consistent or not. other
important cohomological groups in renormalization theory are found in ghost
number 0 and contain the counterterms needed for renormalization. the cal-
culation of these brst cocycles is therefore useful to examine the stability
of the action and to determine if the divergences can be absorbed in a redef-
inition of the elds, masses, coupling constants or other parameters present
in the classical action.

the calculation of the brst cohomology is also relevant to address some
questions of classical eld theory. indeed, the cohomological groups in ghost
number 0 which restrict the form of the counterterms also determine the
consistent interaction terms that can be added to a lagrangian. by consistent

11

it is meant vertices which preserve gauge invariance and therefore the number
of degrees of freedom. the brst cohomology is also very powerful to study
the gauge invariant nature of the conserved currents of a theory. indeed, as
explained in section 2.3, this problem is related to the calculation of the
cohomological groups in ghost number 1.

to obtain the brst cohomology we will closely follow the approach de-
veloped for yang-mills theory1. this is possible mainly because the brst
dierential of p-form gauge theories splits as in the yang-mills case as the
sum of the koszul-tate dierential  and the longitudinal exterior derivative
: s =  +  (for chapline-manton models (chapter 7), this form of s is
obtained after a change of variables). the roles of the koszul-tate dier-
ential and the longitudinal exterior derivative are respectively to implement
the equations of motion and to take into account the gauge invariance of the
theory.

our analysis will be performed in the presence of antields; in the ter-
minology of path integral quantization, they are the sources of the brst
variations of the elds and ghosts. they are useful in renormalization theory
to control how gauge invariance survives renormalization and they also pro-
vide a convenient way to take into account the dynamics of the model when
one addresses the problems of classical eld theory raised above.

as in the yang-mills case, our study of the brst cohomology is composed
of two parts.
in the rst one, we calculate the solutions of wess-zumino
consistency condition which do not depend on the antields. our analysis
relies on the resolution of the so-called descent equations from which one
obtains the cohomology h(|d) by relating it to the cohomology h().

in the second part of our study, we calculate the antield dependent
brst cocycles. their existence is closely tied to the presence of non-
vanishing classes in the characteristic cohomology h(|d). this cohomol-
ogy is dened as the set of q-forms w (see section 2.5) which satisfy the
conditions:

dw  0;

w 6 d.

(1.2)

in (1.2) d is the spacetime exterior derivative and the symbol  means equal
when the equations of motion hold. the calculation of the characteristic co-
homology is an interesting problem on its own but is also related to important
questions of eld theory (see chapter 5).

our analysis will show that the brst cocycles naturally fall into two
in the rst category, one has the cocycles a which are strictly

categories.

and a list of the original works on the subject can be found in [13, 14].

introduction

annihilated by s. they consist of the gauge invariant functions of the theory
and are easily constructed. in second category, one has the cocycles which are
s-closed only modulo the spacetime exterior derivative d, i.e., which satisfy
sa + db = 0. a priori, any cocycle can depend on the components of the
antisymmetric tensors, the corresponding ghosts and antields as well as
their derivatives. however, a remarkable property of the solutions of the
wess-zumino consistency condition belonging to the second category is that
they only depend on the exterior forms build up from the antisymmetric
tensors, the ghosts and the antields and not on the individual components
of these forms. this property explains a posteriori why the calculation of
the brst cohomology in the algebra of forms and their exterior derivatives
does not miss any of the cocycles of the second category2.

from the analysis of the brst cohomology, we will obtain for the models
considered all the candidate anomalies, counterterms, consistent interactions
and we will analyze the gauge structure of the conserved currents. our main
result will be the classication of all the rst-order vertices which can be
added to the action of a system of free p-forms (p > 1). their construction
has attracted a lot of interest in the past [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] but
systematic results were only obtained recently [22]. we will show that besides
the strictly gauge invariant ones, the rst-order vertices are necessarily of the
noether form conserved antisymmetric tensor times p-form potential and
exist only in particular spacetime dimensions. the higher-order vertices will
also be studied for a system containing forms of two dierent degrees. this
analysis will unveil only one type of consistent interacting theory which is
not of the forms described in [15, 16, 18, 19].

our thesis is organized as follows. in chapter 2, we expose briey the
brst eld-antield construction and describe how it addresses the problems
of classical and quantum theory we have outlined. we will also dene the
mathematical framework in which the calculations will be done.

in chapter 3, we perform the brst construction for an arbitrary system
of free p-forms, i.e, we introduce all the necessary antields, ghosts and dene
their transformation under the brst dierential in terms of the koszul-tate
dierential and the longitudinal exterior derivative. we then give results con-
cerning the cohomologies of the koszul-tate dierential and the spacetime
exterior derivative (poincare lemma). by making use of young diagrams
we also calculate the cohomology h() of the longitudinal exterior deriva-
tive which represents an essential ingredient in the analysis of the antield
independent solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition.

2this statement is true except for the antield dependent brst cocycles related to

the conserved currents of the theory (see theorem 26).

13

in chapter 4 we begin our study of the brst cohomology for the system
of p-forms described in chapter 3. chapter 4 is divided into three sec-
tions and begins with an outline of the methods used to obtain the antield
(in)dependent brst cocycles. in section 4.2 we analyze the wess-zumino
consistency condition in the absence of antields. we begin by reviewing
the technic of the descent equations: we illustrate it with simple examples
and then describe the general theory. we then show that for free p-forms,
one can investigate the wess-zumino consistency condition in the so-called
small algebra. after that we introduce the universal algebra and we
formulate the generalized transgression lemma from which one is able to ob-
tain all the non-trivial cocycles. the results of the analysis are presented in
section 4.2.6 and we summarize them in section 4.2.8 by listing the vari-
ous (antield independent) counterterms and anomalies. in section 4.3 we
turn our attention to the antield dependent solutions of the wess-zumino
consistency condition and we prove some preliminary results. in particular
we show that the existence of antield dependent brst cocycles is related
to the presence of non-vanishing classes in the characteristic cohomology.
this cohomology is studied in chapter 5 which begins by a general de-

scription of the subject and a summary of our results.

in chapter 6, we continue the analysis of the wess-zumino consistency
condition in the presence of antields. using the results of chapter 5 we
obtain in section 6.1 all the antield dependent brst cocycles from which
we infer in section 6.2 and 6.3 the corresponding counterterms, rst-order
vertices, anomalies and the gauge structure of the conserved currents of the
theory. the last section of chapter 6 is dedicated to the construction of
interacting p-form theories which are consistent to all orders in the coupling
constant.

in chapter 7 we study the brst cohomology for chapline-manton mod-
els. the analysis is similar to the one of the free theory since after a re-
denition of the antields the brst dierential is brought to the standard
form s =  + . thus we begin by studying the antield independent cocy-
cles, then the characteristic cohomology and nally the antield dependent
cocycles. the important lesson of the analysis of chapline-manton models
is that the results gathered for the free theory are useful in the analysis of
interacting theories since they allow to obtain the cohomological groups by
perturbative arguments.

finally, in chapter 8 we conclude this dissertation with a few comments.

chapter 2

brst formalism

one of the benets of the brst eld-antield formalism is that it allows one
to formulate in a purely algebraic manner certain questions concerning the
(classical or quantum) theory of elds. in this section we briey describe how
this formalism is introduced and how it deals with the following questions:

1. determination of the consistent deformations of a classical theory,

2. analysis of the gauge invariant nature of conserved currents of a classical

theory.

3. classication of possible counterterms occurring in the renormalization

of quantum theory,

4. determination of candidate anomalies which can occur as a result of

the quantization of a classical theory.

we will also describe the mathematical framework in which the calcula-

tions will be done.

2.1 brst action and master equation

let us start by introducing rapidly the various ingredients of the brst
formalism which are relevant for our discussion of the questions raised above.

the starting point of the analysis is a local classical action i,

i =z dnxl(i, i, . . . ).

(2.1)

by local we mean that l depends on the elds and their derivatives up to a
nite order k.

2.1 brst action and master equation

15

the rst step in the brst construction is to associate with each eld i
present in (2.1) another eld called an antield. these antields, which we
label 
i , are assigned a degree called the antighost number which is equal to
1.

besides being invariant under some global symmetries acting on the elds,
the action i can be invariant under some gauge transformations. these have
the property that their parameters, , can be set independently at each
point in spacetime, i.e.,  = (x). for each of these gauge parameters,
one introduces another antield 
 of antighost number 2, as well as a eld
called a ghost, which we label c . this ghost is assigned a degree called
the pureghost number which is equal to 1. the pureghost number of the
antields and the antighost number of the ghosts are set equal to zero. one
also introduces a third degree called the ghost number which is equal to the
dierence between the pureghost number and the antighost number.

a gauge theory is said to be reducible when the gauge parameters are
not all independent. in that case, the gauge transformations are themselves
invariant under certain variations of the gauge parameters . for each pa-
rameter involved in the transformations of , one again introduces a new
antield 

 of antighost number 3 and a ghost c  of pureghost number 2.

this construction continues if the transformations of the gauge param-
eters are themselves reducible and so on. we will suppose here that the
construction stops after a nite number of steps so that the number of anti-
elds and ghosts introduced is nite. the last ghosts introduced are called
the ghosts of ghosts.

once all the necessary antields and ghosts have been dened, one can
introduce the brst dierential s and dene its action on all the variables.
the general expression of s is of the form,

s =  +  + s1 + s2 + . . . .

(2.2)

in (2.2) the rst part of s is the koszul-tate dierential .
its role is to
implement the equations of motion in cohomology, i.e., its cohomology is
given by the on-shell functions and in particular, any function which vanishes
on-shell is -exact. the second operator present in (2.2) is the longitudinal
exterior derivative . its role is to take into account the gauge invariance
of the theory;  is thus constructed in such a way that any observable is
annihilated by  on-shell. the general expressions for  and  may be found
in [23] and will be given later for the various models considered in this thesis.
let us only note here that:  lowers by one unit the antighost number while
 leaves it unchanged;  is nilpotent and  is nilpotent modulo , i.e,  is a
dierential in the cohomology h()  ker 
im  ;  and  anticommute ( +  =
0).

16

brst formalism

the extra terms sj present in s are of antighost number j (they raise the
antighost number by j units). their action on the variables is obtained by
requiring that s2 = 0.

for all the models we consider in this thesis, we will see that s reduces to
the sum of  and : s =  + .1 in the rest of the text we will assume that
s has this particular form.

once the action of s on all the elds, ghosts and antields has been
obtained, one can construct a new action s of ghost number 0 called the
brst action which generates the brst symmetry s. it is dened by2,

s =z dnx(l + ()a

asa),

(2.3)

where a is the grassmann parity of a. we have denoted all the antields
, . . . ) and the elds and ghosts by a  (i, c , c , . . . ).
by 
by construction the brst action is such that,

a  (

i , 

, 

sa = (s, a) = 

s

a = (s, 

a) =

rs
a(x)


rs

.

a(x)

furthermore, s satises the master equation,

(s, s) = 0,

,

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

where the antibracket (., .) of two local functionals a and b is dened by,

(a, b) =z dnx(cid:18) ra

a(x)

lb
a(x)





ra
a(x)



lb

a(x)(cid:19) .

(2.7)

the master equation (2.6) is a direct consequence of s2 = 0.

an important feature is that by construction, the brst action contains
all the information about the action and its gauge structure. for instance
one can directly read o from its expression the gauge transformations, their
algebra, the reducibility identities etc.

in the following sections we quickly review how the brst formalism

addresses the questions raised at the beginning of this section.

1for chapline-manton models this form of s is obtained by a redenition of the anti-

elds.

2this form of the brst dierential is not the most general one; indeed there are some
theories for which s contains terms which are not linear in the antields. however, the
models examined in this thesis all admit a brst action of the form (2.3).

2.2 consistent deformations

2.2 consistent deformations

let us illustrate the problem of consistent deformations for an irreducible
gauge theory (for a recent and more complete review see [24]).

let i0 be a free3 action invariant under some gauge transformations

i = ri

0, i.e.,

z dnx

i0
i ri

0 = 0.

(2.8)

a deformation of the free action consists in adding to i0 interaction vertices,

i0  i = i0 + gi1 + g2i2 + . . . ,

(2.9)

where g is a coupling constant. in order to be consistent, we require the de-
formation to preserve gauge invariance. therefore, the action i must remain
gauge invariant, possibly under modied gauge transformations:

z dnx

i
i ri

 = 0.

eq. (2.10) has to be satised at each order in the coupling constant.

the deformations of an action can be of two types.

in the rst one,
gauge invariant terms are added to the original lagrangian and therefore no
modication of the gauge transformations is required.
in maxwell theory,
chern-simons terms produce such deformations. the second type of defor-
mations are obtained by adding vertices which are not invariant under the
original gauge transformations and which therefore require a modication in
them. in such a case, the algebra of the new gauge transformations can also
be altered. a famous example is the yang-mills theory in which the abelian
u(1)n symmetry is replaced by the non-abelian su(n) symmetry.

for reducible theories, one also imposes the gauge transformations (2.11)
to remain reducible and all higher order reducibility identities to hold (possi-
bly in a deformed way). these consistency requirements guarantee that both
the deformed theory and the free theory contain the same number of degrees
of freedom.

3although the action i0 can already contain interaction vertices, we call it free as it is

the action we want to deform.

18

brst formalism

the problem of consistent interactions among elds can be elegantly for-
mulated within the brst eld-antield formalism [25]. indeed, let s0 be the
solution of the master equation for a free theory,

(s0, s0) = 0.

(2.12)

if one deforms this free theory, the lagrangian, its gauge transformations,
reducibility identities etc. are modied. therefore, the brst action s0 which
encodes all this information it is also modied and becomes,

s = s0 + gs1 + g2s2 + . . . ,

(2.13)

where all the terms are of ghost number 0. all our consistency requirements
will be met if the new brst action continues to satisfy the master equation
(2.6). indeed, (s, s) = 0 guarantees in particular that condition (2.10) is
fullled but this is also true for all the higher order reducibility identities.

as we already stressed, the brst action encodes all the information
about the gauge structure of the theory. in its expansion (2.3) according to
the antighost number, one encounters three terms of special interest in the
present discussion:

1. the antield independent term which corresponds to the full interacting

lagrangian;

i ri

2. a term of the form 

c  (where 

i are the antields of antighost
number 1 and the c  are the ghosts of pureghost number 1). from
this term one deduces the modied gauge transformations of the elds
i = ri
. note that if s1, s2, . . . do not depend on the antields
then the gauge transformations leaving the deformed action invariant
are identical to those of the free theory.



3. a term of the form c 

c c  (where 

 are the antields of antighost
number 2). this term is present when the gauge transformations are
not abelian even on-shell; the c 
 are the structure constants of the
algebra of the gauge transformations.

the advantage of using the brst formalism to address the problem of consis-
tent deformations is that one can make use of the cohomological techniques.
indeed, as eq. (s, s) = 0 must be fullled at each order in the coupling
constant, one gets a tower of equations which reads,

(s0, s0) = 0,
2(s0, s1) = 0,
2(s0, s2) + (s1, s1) = 0,

...

(2.14)
(2.15)
(2.16)

2.2 consistent deformations

19

the rst equation is satised by hypothesis. the second one implies that s1 is
a cocycle of the brst dierential s of the free theory. this condition, known
as the wess-zumino consistency condition, imposes very strong restrictions
on s1 and thus provides a convenient way to determine all the rst order
vertices.

the interesting s1 are in fact elements of the cohomology h 0(s). to see
this, suppose that s1 is of the form s1 = st1 where t1 is of ghost number
1. since s2 = 0, s1 is automatically a brst cocycle. however, such so-
lutions correspond to trivial deformations because they amount to eld
redenitions in the original action [25, 24]. therefore, the non-trivial defor-
mations of the brst action are represented by the cohomological classes of
h 0(s)  ker s
im s .

at order g2, condition (2.16) indicates that the antibracket of s1 with
itself must be s-exact. this is a new constraint for s1 but it also denes s2
up to an s-exact term. if locality (as dened above) is not imposed to the
functionals, one can show that condition (2.16) is always satised because
the antibracket of two closed functionals is always exact. this is also true for
all the other equations beneath (2.16). it is thus only when one requires the
functionals to be local that one can meet an obstruction in the construction
of the higher order vertices corresponding to s1.

to properly take into account locality one reformulates all the equations

in terms of their integrands. for instance, eq. (2.15) can be written,

ss1 = 0  s(cid:0)z s1(cid:1) = 0 z (ss1) = 0.

in terms of the integrand s1 the last equation reads,

ss1 + dm1 = 0,

(2.17)

(2.18)

where m1 is a local form of degree n  1 and ghost number 1 and d is the
spacetime exterior derivative. again one can show that brst-exact terms
modulo d are trivial solutions of (2.18) and correspond to trivial deforma-
in order to implement locality, the proper cohomology to evaluate
tions.
is thus h n
0 (s|d) where the superscript and subscript respectively denote the
form degree and ghost number.

the local equivalent of (2.16) is,

ss2 + (s1, s1) + dm2 = 0,

(2.19)

where we have set s2 =r s2 while (s1, s1) is dened by (s1, s1) =r (s1, s1)

up to an irrelevant d-exact term. contrary to the previous situation in which

20

brst formalism

one did not impose locality, eq. (2.19) is not automatically fullled if one
requires s2 and m2 to be local functions. it indicates that (s1, s1), which
is of form degree n and ghost number 1, must be brst-exact modulo d.
therefore, the construction of s can be obstructed at this stage if h n
1 (s|d)
does not vanish.

the consistency conditions at higher order in the coupling constant are
also non-trivial for local functionals and it is immediate to check that further
obstructions to the construction of s can arise only if h n

1 (s|d) is not zero.

to summarize, the problem of consistent deformations is elegantly cap-
tured by the brst-eld antield formalism. the non-trivial rst order ver-
tices are representatives of h n
0 (s|d) and the construction of the higher order
vertices can be obstructed if h n
1 (s|d) is non-vanishing. these observations
motivate the study of these two cohomological groups.

2.3 gauge invariant conserved currents and

global symmetries

in this section we discuss the role of the brst cohomology in the study of
the gauge structure of global symmetries and conserved currents [26].

a global symmetry of a eld theory is a transformation of the elds de-

pending on constant parameters,

i = ai(j, j, . . . ),

(2.20)

which leaves the action invariant or in other words, which leaves the la-
grangian invariant up to a total derivative, i.e.,

l
i i + j = 0.

(2.21)

in (2.21), j is the conserved current associated with the symmetry i.

if we set a1 = 

i aidnx, (2.21) can be rewritten as,

a1 + dj = 0,

(2.22)

where j is the n1 form dual to j. we have used the fact that by denition,

i . the n-form a1 of antighost number 1 therefore denes an
element of the cohomological group h n

i =  l

1 (|d).

a global symmetry is said to be trivial if the corresponding a1 denes a

trivial element in h n

1 (|d), i.e.,

a1 = r2 + dc1.

(2.23)

2.3 gauge invariant conserved currents and global symmetries 21

this is the case if and only if the global symmetry reduces on-shell to a gauge
transformation [23, 27]. two global symmetries are said to be equivalent if
they dier by a trivial symmetry. therefore, the equivalence classes of non-
trivial symmetries correspond to the classes of h n

1 (|d).

from eq. (2.21), we see that there is a well dened map between the
cohomological classes of h n
1 (|d) and the classes of conserved currents, where
two currents are said to be equivalent if they dier by a term of the form:
e1 + dm where m is a n  2 form. such a term reduces on-shell to an
identically conserved current and will be called a trivial current. this does
not mean that trivial currents are devoid of physical interest but rather that
their expression is easily obtained.

the question we want to answer is: can a1 and j be redened (im-
proved) by the addition of trivial terms in order to make them gauge invari-
ant. in other words, does one have a
1 = a1 + r2 + dc1
and j = j + e1 + dm?

1 = j = 0 with a

using the following isomorphism theorem, one can relate this question to

the calculation of the local brst cohomology h(s|d):

theorem 1. (valid in particular for the p-form gauge theories considered in
this thesis)

hk(s|d) (hk(|d, h0())

hk(|d)

k  0
k < 0

(2.24)

proof: the proof of this result can be found in [28].

using the case k < 0 of theorem 1 we see that to any class of h n
representing a global symmetry we can associate a class of h n
number 1. the map q : h n
manner. let a be a representative of a class of h n
a according to the antighost number is of the form:

1 (|d)
1(s|d) of ghost
1 (|d) is realized in the following
1(s|d). the expansion of

1(s|d)  h n

a = a1 + a2 + . . . + ak.

(2.25)

since a satises the wess-zumino consistency condition sa+db = 0, the term
a1 satises a1 + db0 = 0 and therefore denes an element of h n
1 (|d). it is
easy to see that the map q : h n
1 (|d) : [a]  [a1] is well dened
in cohomology since a change of representative in h n
1(s|d) (a  a + sr + dc)
does not change the class of a1 in h n

1 (|d) (a1  a1 + r2 + dc1).

1(s|d)  h n

the brst cocycles (2.25) can be classied according to the value of k
at which their expansion (according to the antighost number) stops. this

22

brst formalism

expansion genuinely stops at order k if it is not possible to remove the term
ak by the addition of trivial terms.

because a is a brst cocycle, the last term ak satises the equation
ak + dbk = 0. in section 4.3 however we will show that in each class of
h(s|d) there is a representative which satises the simpler equation ak = 0.
this means that the only global symmetries which cannot be made gauge
invariant are those for which the term ak in the corresponding brst cocycle
is genuinely of order k. indeed, if the terms in a of antighost numbers j > 1
can be removed by the addition of trivial terms then the corresponding class
of h n
1 = 0 and which is therefore
gauge invariant.

1 (|d) has a representative which obeys a

our analysis of section 6.3 will show that when one excludes an explicit
dependence on the spacetime coordinates, the only brst cocycles in ghost
number 1 which cannot be assumed to stop at order 1 are those which
correspond to the following global symmetries:

ba

1...p = ka

bbb

1...p, with ka

b an antisymmetric matrix.

(2.26)

since the ka
b are antisymmetric matrices these global symmetries correspond
to rotations of the p-forms among themselves. only these are not equivalent
to a gauge invariant global symmetry.

once this result has been obtained, one may investigate which conserved
currents can or cannot be made gauge invariant. our analysis establishes that
the only currents that cannot be made gauge invariant are those associated
to the global symmetries (2.26).

the crucial part of our study of the gauge invariant nature of the global
symmetries and the conserved currents is the classication of the solution of
the wess-zumino consistency condition in ghost number 1.

2.4 counterterms and anomalies

in this section we analyze the role of the brst eld-antield formalism in
the theory of renormalization. our presentation is based on [13].

in order to quantize a gauge theory by the method of path integral it is
necessary to x the gauge in order to obtain properly dened green functions.
a convenient way of achieving this is to introduce auxiliary elds and to dene
a gauge-xing fermion.

the auxiliary elds consist of ghosts and antields and will respectively

and their ghost numbers and grassmann parities are related by,

i  1,
i )  1.

(c i) = (b

23

(2.27)
(2.28)

(2.29)

(2.30)

the number of auxiliary elds required depends on the theory considered
and in particular on its order of reducibility.

by virtue of (2.27) and (2.28), the brst action generating the dierential

s in presence of auxiliary elds is still given by,

s =z dnx(l + ()a

asa),

where the a and 

a now include the auxiliary elds.

the extended brst action sext is dened as,

sext[a, 

a] = s[a, 

a +

r
a ].

(2.31)

(2.32)

in (2.32),  is the gauge-xing fermion. it is of ghost number 1 and de-
pends only on the a. it is chosen in such a way that the feynman rules
obtained from sext[a, 
a = 0] are well dened. it is easy to see that the
extended brst action satises the master equation (sext, sext) = 0 where
the antibracket is now expressed in terms of the variables a and 
a. from
(2.32) one can formally calculate all the green functions of the theory.

the eective action  is dened as the generating functional for the con-

nected one particle irreducible, amputated vertex functions,

[ ] =



xm=2

1

m!z dnx1...dnxm (x1)... (xm)< 0|t (x1)...(xm)|0 >1p i,amp.

(2.33)

in (2.33) all the elds, ghosts and antields have been collectively denoted
. the  are the corresponding smooth, fast decreasing test functions.

as is well known, when one tries to calculate the eective action by
using the feynman rules, one encounters diculties arising from ill-dened
(innite) quantities. therefore, in order for the theory to make sense one
needs a regularization scheme which eliminates those innities.

24

brst formalism

to be more precise,  admits an expansion in powers of ,

 = (0) + (1) + 2(2) + . . . .

(2.34)

in (2.34) one can show that the rst term is a tree diagram which actually
coincides with the extended brst action sext. the other terms are loop
diagrams, the number of loops being given by the power in . the problems
usually begin when one tries to calculate (1).
in order to eliminate the
innite quantity present in (1) one needs to regularize the theory by giving a
meaning to divergent integrals. this can be done for example but introducing
a cut-o . eq. (2.34) then becomes,

reg( a, 

a) = sext + (1)

div() + (1)

f () + o(2),

(2.35)

where (1)
when   .

div() is the sum of the one loop contributions to  which diverge

problems can occur when the regularization introduced fails to preserve
at the quantum level the local symmetries of the classical action. indeed, the
quantum action principle [29] states that the following identity holds,

(reg, reg)( ) = ( ) + o(2),

(2.36)

1
2

where the antibracket is taken with respect to the sources a and 
a. the
term ( ) is an integrated polynomial of ghost number 1. it represents at
order  the obstruction for reg to satisfy the equation,

(reg, reg) = 0.

(2.37)

if a term ( ) is present and cannot be removed by adding local counterterms
to the classical action, the theory is said to be anomalous. indeed, eq. (2.37)
reects gauge invariance and has to be satised in order to guarantee the
consistency of the quantum theory and in particular its unitarity.

by taking the antibracket of eq. (2.36) with reg and using the jacobi
identity (reg, (reg, reg))  0 one obtains a consistency requirement for the
anomaly ( ) [12]:

(sext, ) = 0.

(2.38)

this implies that the anomalies have to satisfy the wess-zumino consistency
condition for the dierential sext = (sext, . ). the problem of nding the
possible anomalies of the theory is in fact of cohomological nature since
trivial solutions of (2.38) can be easily eliminated by modifying the original

2.5 general denitions

25

action sext. indeed if  = (sext, ), the redenition sext  sext   yields
at order , (reg, reg) = 0. therefore, the non-trivial anomalies are elements
of h n

1 (sext).
if the theory can be shown to be free from anomalies, then the brst
cohomology is also useful to determine the counterterms required to renor-
malize the theory. indeed, in that case eq. (2.36) implies at order  for the
divergent contributions to ,

(sext, (1)

div) = 0.

(2.39)

the counterterms are thus solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condi-
tion in ghost number 0. as in the case of anomalies, there are some trivial
solutions to (2.39) given by (1) = (sext, ) where  is of ghost number 1.
they are called trivial because they amount to eld redenitions in the action
sext.

the above discussion shows that two important questions concerning
renormalization can be examined by the calculation of the brst cohomology
of the dierential sext. one can in fact show that this cohomology is isomor-
phic to h(s) where s is the brst dierential of the free theory. the isomor-
phism is implemented by making the change of variables 
a in
the representatives of h(s).

this concludes our survey of the use of the brst cohomology in classical
and quantum eld theory. in the next section we will formulate precisely the
mathematical framework in which the wess-zumino consistency condition
will be studied.

2.5 general denitions

in the previous sections we have emphasized the role of the brst cohomology
in eld theory. however, in order to focus the attention on the physical ideas
we deliberately postponed the precise denition of the space in which the
calculations have to be done.

the standard way to impose locality in the brst formalism is to work
in the so-called jet spaces. to that end, we dene a local function f as a
function which depends on the spacetime coordinates x, the elds (including
the ghosts and the antields) and their derivatives up to a nite order k,

f = f (x, , , . . . , 1...k).

(2.40)

a local function is thus a function over a nite dimensional space v k called a
jet space which is parameterized by the spacetime coordinates x, the elds

26

brst formalism

 and their subsequent derivatives 1...k up to a nite order k. in the
sequel we will always assume that spacetime has the topology of rn.

a local functional f is then dened as the integral of local function:

f =z dnxf (x, , , . . . , 1...k ).

(2.41)

by denition, the local brst cohomology h(s) is the set of local functionals
which satisfy the equation,

sf = sz dnx f = 0,

(for all allowed eld congurations) and which are not of the form,

f = sg = sz dnx g,

(2.42)

(2.43)

with g a local function.

the next step in the analysis is to remove the integral sign. this is done
by recalling that eq. (2.42) is satised if and only if there exist a local n  1
form m such that,

sf + dm = 0,

(2.44)

withh m = 0; a local q-form a is dened as a spacetime form with coecients

belonging to the algebra of local functions:

a = a1...q (x, , , . . . , 1...k )dx1  . . .  dxq .

(2.45)

in (2.44) d is the algebraic spacetime exterior derivative dened on local
forms as,

dm = dxm, and

m =

m
x + 

lm


+ 

lm
( )

+ . . . + 1...s

(2.46)

. (2.47)

lm

(1...s)

similarly, the coboundary condition (2.43) is equivalent to,

f = sg + dl,

(2.48)

with l a local n  1 form such that h l = 0.

accordingly, the cohomology h(s) in the space of local functionals is

isomorphic to the cohomology h(s|d) in the space of local functions.

2.5 general denitions

27

the conditionsh m =h l = 0 are rather awkward to take into account (in

particular they depend on the precise conditions imposed on the elds at the
boundaries). therefore, one usually investigates h(s|d) without restrictions
on the (n  1)-forms at the boundary. one thus allows elements of h(s|d)
that do not dene s-closed local functionals because of non-vanishing surface
terms.

because we are interested in the physical problems described in section
2.2-2.4 we will further restrict the algebra of local functions. indeed, the
counterterms and anomalies are in fact local integrated polynomials. we
will also impose this condition on the consistent deformations (at each order
in the coupling constant) and on the conserved currents. the local brst
cohomology h(s|d) will therefore be investigated in the space of local q-
forms with coecients that are polynomials in elds and their derivatives.
this algebra will be denoted by p. thus, a belongs to p if and only if

a = 1...q (x, [])dx1 . . . dxq,

(2.49)

with  a polynomial. the notation f ([y]) means that f depends on y and
its successive derivatives. note that in (2.49) we have dropped the  symbol
between the dx.

we will also perform many of the calculations in the algebra of local q-
forms which do not depend explicitly on the spacetime coordinates x. this
algebra will be denoted p.

(3.5)

where h

is the n  pa  1 form dual to h a1...pa .

3.2 brst dierential

29

the main feature of theories involving p-form gauge elds is that their
gauge symmetries are reducible. more precisely, in the present case, the
lagrangian (3.2) is invariant under the gauge transformations,

ba  b

a = ba + da

(3.6)

where a are arbitrary (pa  1)-forms. now, if a = da, then, the varia-
tion of ba vanishes identically. thus, the gauge parameters a do not all
provide independent gauge symmetries: the gauge transformations (3.6) are
reducible. in the same way, if a is equal to da, then, it yields a vanishing
a. there is reducibility of reducibility unless a is a zero form. if a is
not a zero form, the process keeps going until one reaches 0-forms. for the
theory with lagrangian (3.2), there are thus pm  1 stages of reducibility of
the gauge transformations (a is a (pa  1)-form), where pm is the degree of
the form of highest degree occurring in (3.2) [30, 31, 32, 20]. one says that
the theory is a reducible gauge theory of reducibility order pm  1.

3.2 brst dierential

we dene the action of the brst dierential s along the lines recalled in
section 2.1. therefore we need to introduce besides the elds, some antields
and some ghosts. because the theory is reducible (of order pa  1 for each
a), the following set of antields [23, 10, 11] is required:

ba1...pa , ba1...pa1, . . . , ba1, ba.

(3.7)

1...pa

the grassmann parity and the antighost number of the antields ba1...pa
associated with the elds ba
are equal to 1. the grassmann parity and
the antighost number of the other antields is determined according to the
following rule. as one moves from one term to the next one to its right in
(3.7), the grassmann parity changes and the antighost number increases by
one unit. therefore the parity and the antighost number of a given antield
ba1...paj are respectively j + 1 modulo 2 and j + 1.

reducibility also imposes the following set of ghosts [23, 10, 11]:

c a
1...pa1, . . . , c a

1...paj , . . . , c a.

(3.8)

these ghosts carry a degree called the pure ghost number. the pure ghost
number of c a
1...pa1 and its grassmann parity are equal to 1. as one moves
from one term to the next one to its right in (3.8), the grassmann parity
changes and the ghost number increases by one unit up to pa.

30

free theory: brst construction

for each eld, the ghost number is dened as the dierence between the

pureghost number and the antighost number.

the role of the koszul-tate dierential is to implement the equations of
motion in cohomology. this statement is contained in the following theorem:

theorem 2. (valid in p and p) let i be the antighost number. then,
hi() = 0 for i > 0, i.e., the cohomology of  vanishes in antighost number
strictly greater than zero. furthermore, the cohomology of  in antighost
number zero is given by the algebra of on-shell spacetime forms.

proof:

see [33, 34, 23, 35] and also [27] for the explicit proof in the case

of 1-forms and 2-forms.

3.2 brst dierential

33

while  controls the dynamics of the theory, the role of the exterior lon-
gitudinal derivative is to take care of the gauge invariance. therefore, the
only combinations of the elds ba
and their derivatives appearing in the
cohomology of  should be the eld strengths and their derivatives. indeed,
those are the only gauge invariant objects that can be formed out of the elds
and their derivatives. the following theorem shows that the denition of 
is consistent with this requirement.

1...pa

theorem 3. (valid in p and p) the cohomology of  is given by,

h() = i  c,

(3.21)

where c is the algebra generated by the undierentiated ghosts c a
pa, and i
is the algebra of spacetime forms with coecients that are polynomials in
the elds strengths, their derivatives, the antields and their derivatives. in
particular, in antighost and pure ghost numbers equal to zero, one can take
as representatives of the cohomological classes the gauge invariant forms.
rem: from now on, the variables generating i will be denoted by .

proof: one follows the standard method which consists in separating the
variables into three sets obeying respectively xi = 0, y = z,
z = 0. the variables y and z form contractible pairs and the
cohomology is then generated by the (independent) variables xi. in
our case, the xi are given by x, dx, the elds strength components,
the antields and their derivatives as well as the last (undierentiated)
ghosts of ghosts (in p the x are absent). of course, for the proof
to work, any identity veried by the y should also be veried by the
z, so that the independent z are all killed in cohomology.

let us rst note that x, dx, the antields and their derivatives
are automatically part of the xi since they are -closed and do not
appear in the -variations.

to show that indeed the rest of the generators of p, which are

pose the 1...k c a

group gl(n). since the 1...kc a

this ends the proof of the theorem. note that the generators are not
independent but restricted by the bianchi identity dh a = 0.

the last two theorems remain valid if we restrict ourselves to p except

that the spacetime forms are now independent of the coordinates x.

3.3 poincare lemma

in the sequel, we will also need the following result on the cohomology of d:

3.3 poincare lemma

35

theorem 4. the cohomology of d in the algebra of local forms p is given
by,

h 0(d)  r,
h k(d) = 0 for k 6= 0, k 6= n,
h n(d)  space of equivalence classes of local forms,

(3.32)
(3.33)
(3.34)

where k is the form degree and n the spacetime dimension. in (3.34), two
local forms are said to be equivalent if and only if they have identical euler-
lagrange derivatives with respect to all the elds and the antields.

proof: this theorem is known as the algebraic poincare lemma. it diers
from the usual poincare lemma because here we only work with local
forms in the various elds and their derivatives. for various proofs,
see [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49].

it should be mentioned that the theorem holds as such only in p. in p,
(3.33) would have to be amended as

h k(d)  {constant forms} for k 6= 0, k 6= n,

(3.35)

where the constant forms are by denition the local exterior forms with
constant coecients. indeed, the explicit x-dependence enables one to re-
move the constant k-forms (k > 0) from the cohomology, since these are
exact, ci1i2...ik dxi1dxi2 . . . dxik = d(ci1i2...ikxi1 dxi2 . . . dxik). note that the
constant exterior forms can be alternatively eliminated without introduc-
ing an explicit x-dependence, but by imposing lorentz invariance (there is
no lorentz-invariant constant k-form for 0 < k < n).

we shall denote in the sequel the algebra of constant forms by  and

the subspace of constants forms of degree k by k.

the following formulation of the poincare lemma is also useful.

theorem 5. let a be a local, closed k-form (k < n) that vanishes when the
elds, the ghosts and the antields are set equal to zero. then, a is d-exact.

proof: the condition that a vanishes when the elds and the antields

are set equal to zero eliminates the constants.

this form of the poincare lemma holds in both the algebras of x-dependent
and x-independent local exterior forms.

36

free theory: brst construction

3.4 mixed forms

in our analysis of the brst cohomology, in turns out that two combinations
of the elds and antields play a central role. the rst one groups the eld
strengths and the duals of the antields and is denoted h a,

h a = h

a

+

b

a
j .

pa+1

xj=1

(3.36)

the second one combines the pa-forms and their associated ghosts and is
denoted ba,

ba = ba + c a

1 + . . . + c a
pa.

(3.37)

the regrouping of physical elds with ghost-like variables is quite standard
in brst theory [50]. expressions similar (but not identical) to (3.36) have
appeared in the analysis of the freedman-townsend model and of string eld
theory [51, 52], as well as in the context of topological models [53, 54]. note
that for a one-form, expression (3.36) reduces to relation (9.8) of [28].

it is easy to see that both h a and ba have a denite grassmann parity
respectively given by npa+1 and pa modulo 2. on the other hand, products
of h a or ba are not homogeneous in form degree and ghost number. to
isolate a component of a given form degree k and ghost number g we enclose
the product in brackets [. . . ]k
g.

since products of ba very frequently appear in the rest of the text, we

introduce the following notations,

qa1...am = ba1 . . . bam and qa1...am

k,g

= [ ba1 . . . bam]k
g.

(3.38)

for example, using these conventions, we write the most general representa-
,

we also dene the three mixed operators:  =  + d,  =  + d and

tive of h() as, a = pm a1...am()[ ba1 . . . bam]0
with l =pm pam.

s = s + d.

l = pm a1...am()qa1...am

0,l

using those denitions we have the following relations:

 h a = 0,  ba = 0,
 ba = h a,
 h a = 0,
s h a = 0,
s ba = h a.

(3.39)

(3.40)

(3.41)

eq.  ba = h a is known in the literature as the horizontality condition
[20].

chapter 4

free theory: brst cohomology
(part i)

4.1 antield dependence of solutions

in the previous chapters, we have introduced the various ingredients of the
brst eld-antield for the system of free p-form gauge elds (3.2). we have
dened all the necessary elds, antields, ghosts and their transformation
law under the brst dierential which in this case reduces to the sum of the
koszul-tate dierential and the longitudinal exterior derivative. we now
start the analysis of the brst cohomology.

the equation we want to solve is,

sak

g + dak1

g+1 = 0,

(4.1)

where ak

g is a polynomial in p() of ghost number g and form degree k.

historically, solutions of (4.1) were rst sought in the absence of anti-
elds. this approach is incomplete since it does only take into account the
gauge invariance of the theory but not its dynamics. for example, by not
investigating the brst cohomology in the presence of antields, one would
miss the yang-mills vertex when computing the various consistent interac-
tions of maxwells theory. we will nevertheless start by determining the
antield independent solution of (4.1) for the following reasons. first, they
are of course interesting on their own. but also, their knowledge is required
in order to apply our method of analysis of the antield dependent solutions.
we will analyze the antield independent solutions of the wess-zumino
consistency condition by studying the so-called descent equations [55, 50, 56].
they were rst studied in the yang-mills theory context. they are however
useful for a large class of theories for which the longitudinal exterior derivative

38

free theory: brst cohomology (part i)

is nilpotent. this is the case for the system (3.2) but also for the chapline-
manton theories as we shall see later. all the relevant details of these
descent equations will be recalled in the next section.

the descent equations for the antield dependent solutions also exist.
however, they cannot be used straightforwardly to obtain the general solu-
tion of (4.1). the main diculty lies in the fact that the antields are of
negative ghost number. therefore, one cannot easily formulate a generalized
transgression lemma when they are present (see theorem 9).

g = ak

g

g,0 + ak

g,1 + . . . + ak

in order to analyze the antield dependent solutions we therefore follow
another approach. first, we decompose the solutions of (4.1) according to
the antighost number, ak
g,q. when performing such a
decomposition, we suppose that the term of highest antighost number (an
g,q)
g1 + dck1
g,q 6= sek
g , i.e., ak
cannot be eliminated by adding trivial terms to an
;
otherwise, the expansion would stop at q1. if q 6= 0 then ak
g is said to depend
non-trivially on the antields. to proceed, we will rst determine the most
general form for the term an
g,q. then, substituing this form in (4.1) we will try
to compute recursively the components an
g,q2 etc. of lower antighost
numbers in an
g . as we shall see, this construction is not obstructed only for a
small number of an
q,q. this way of analyzing the antield dependent solutions
of the wess-zumino consistency condition has some resemblance with the
method of the descent equations and we shall later comment on this.

q,q1, an

4.2 antield independent solutions

as stated, we start by calculating the antield independent solution of the
wess-zumino consistency condition by solving the so-called descent equa-
tion. we rst recall the general procedure of the analysis and then apply it
to free p-forms.

4.2.1 descent equations

because we work here in the absence of antields, eq. (4.1) becomes,

ak

g + dak1

q+1 = 0,

(4.2)

(where g now denotes the pureghost number). this is permissible since both
 and d are of antighost number 0. to a given solution ak
g of (4.2), one
can associate another solution of the wess-zumino consistency condition,
namely, ak1

g+1. indeed, the triviality of d (theorem 5) implies,

ak1

g+1 + dak2

g+2 = 0,

(4.3)

4.2 antield independent solutions

39

g+2. there are ambiguities in the choice of ak1

g+1 given the class [ak
g]
g in h (k,g)(|d), but it is easy to verify that the map  : h (k,g)(|d) 

for some ak2
of ak
h (k1,g+1)(|d) is well dened.

the map  is in general not injective. there are non trivial classes of
h ,(|d) that are mapped on zero through the descent. for instance, if one
iterates , one gets from ak

g]  h (kl,g+l) 7 0 which
h (k1,g+1)(|d) 7 2[ak
must eventually end on zero since there are no forms of negative form degree.

g+l + dbkl2
g+l+1,
g+l  dbkl1,g+l = akl,g+l) in such a way that
one may redene akl
we have akl
g+l+1 = 0. conversely, if akl
g+l is annihilated by ,
then [akl
g+l, or bottom, of
the descent is a -cocycle that is not exact in h ,(|d). the non-injectivity
of  follows precisely from the existence of such cocycles.

g+l] = 0. thus, the last non-trivial element akl

g+l+1 = bkl1

the length of the descent associated with [ak
g] is the integer l for which
l[ak
g] is the last non-trivial cocycle occurring in the chain. one says that a
descent is non trivial if it has length  1. the idea of [57, 58] is to classify
the elements of h ,(|d) according to the length of the associated descent.
in order to achieve this, one must determine the possible bottoms, i.e.,
the elements of h() which are not trivial in h(|d) and which can be lifted
l times.

4.2.2 lifts of elements of h() - an example

the diculty in the analysis of the lift is that contrary to the descent which
carries no ambiguity in cohomology, the lift is ambiguous because h() is
not trivial. furthermore, for the same reason, the lift can be obstructed, i.e.,
given a  h(), there may be no descent (i) which has a as bottom; and (ii)
which starts with a solution b of the wess-zumino consistency condition such
that db = 0 (while any descent ends always with an a such that a = 0). the
rst b may be such that db 6= 0 or even db 6= (something). in that case,

40

free theory: brst cohomology (part i)

there is no element c above b such that c + db = 0 (while there is always
an element e below a such that a + de = 0, namely e = 0: the descent
eectively stops at a but is not obstructed at a).

in this subsection, we shall illustrate these features on a specic example:

that of a free 1-form a and a free 2-form b, with brst algebra

a + da1 = 0, a1 = 0,
b + db1 = 0, b1 + db2 = 0, b2 = 0.

(4.7)
(4.8)

the curvatures are f = da and h = db, with f = h = 0.

consider the -cocycle a1b2. it has form-degree zero and ghost number
three. the descent that ends on this bottom has length one, and not the
maximum length three. indeed, the -cocycle a1b2 can be lifted once, since
there exists a  p such that a + d(a1b2) = 0. one may take a = ab2 +
a1b1. of course, a has form-degree one and ghost number two. if one tries to
lift the given -cocycle a1b2 once more, one meets an obstruction. namely,
there is no b such that b + da = 0. this is because da is in the same -class
as f b2, which is non-trivial, i.e., which cannot be written as a -variation.
it is easy to verify that one cannot remove the obstruction by adding to a
a -cocycle (which would not change a). this provides an example of a
-cocycle for which the lift is obstructed after one step.

consider now the -cocycle 1

2f (b2)2 with ghost number four and form-
degree two. this cocycle can be lifted a rst time, for instance f b1b2 is
above it,

[f b1b2] + d[

1
2

f (b2)2] = 0.

(4.9)

it can be lifted a second time to 1
2(b1)2 + f bb2. however, if one tries to
lift it once more, one meets apparently the obstruction f hb2, since the
exterior derivative of 1
2 (b1)2 + f bb2 diers from the -cocycle f hb2 by a
-exact term. it is true that f hb2 is a non-trivial -cocycle. however, the
obstruction to lifting three times 1
2 f (b2)2 is really absent. what happens is
that we made a wrong choice for the term above the -cocycle 1
2 f (b2)2 and
should have rather taken a term that diers from f b1b2 by an appropriate
-cocycle. this is because f hb2 is in fact the true obstruction to lifting
twice the -cocycle a1hb2. thus if one replaces (4.9) by

[f b1b2  a1hb2] + d[

1
2

f (b2)2] = 0,

(4.10)

which is permissible since (a1hb2) = 0, one removes the obstruction to
further lifting 1
2f (b2)2. this shows that the obstructions to lifting k times

4.2 antield independent solutions

41

a -cocycle are not given by elements of h(), but rather, by elements of
h() that are not themselves obstructions of shorter lifts. the ambiguity in
the choice of the lifts plays accordingly a crucial role in the analysis of the
obstructions.

in fact, the given -cocycle 1

2f (b2)2 is actually trivial in h(|d)

1
2

f (b2)2 =d[

1
2

a(b2)2 + a1b1b2]

+ [ab1b2 +

1
2

a1(b1)2 + a1bb2]

(4.11)

and therefore, its lift can certainly never be obstructed.

4.2.3 lifts of elements of h() - the rst two steps

in order to control these features, it is convenient to introduce new dierential
algebras [57, 58]. let e0  h(). we dene a map d0 : e0  e0 as follows:

d0[a] = [da],

(4.12)

where [ ] is here the class in h(). this map is well dened because da =
da = 0 (so da is a -cocycle) and d(m) = (dm) (so d maps a -
coboundary on a -coboundary). now, d0 is a derivation and d2
0 = 0, so it
is a dierential. cocycles of d0 are elements of h() that can be lifted at
least once since d0[a] = 0  da + b = 0 for some b, so b descends on a.
by contrast, if d0[a] 6= 0, then a cannot be lifted and, in particular, a is not
exact in h(|d) (if it were, a = m + dn, one would have da = dm, i.e.,
da = 0 in h()). let f0 be a subspace of e0 supplementary to ker d0. one
has the isomorphism (as vector spaces),

e0  ker d0  f0.

(4.13)

the next step is to investigate cocycles that can be lifted at least twice.
in order to be liftable at least once, these must be in ker d0 . among the
elements of ker d0, those that are in im d0 are not interesting, because they
are elements of h() that are trivial in h(|d) ([a] = d0[b]  a = db + m).
thus the relevant space is e1  h(d0, e0). one has,

ker d0  im d0  e1.

one then denes the dierential d1 : e1  e1,

d1[[a]] = [[db]],

(4.14)

(4.15)

42

free theory: brst cohomology (part i)

where b is dened through da+b = 0  recall that d0[a] = 0  and where [[a]]
is the class of [a] in e1. it is easy to see that (4.15) provides a well-dened
dierential in e1

1.

if [[a]]  e1 is a d1-cocycle, then it can be lifted at least twice since [[db]] =
0 in e1 means db = du+(something) with u = 0. thus one has da+b = 0
with b = b  u and db = (something). if on the contrary, d1[[a]] 6= 0, then
the corresponding elements in h() cannot be lifted twice, d1[[a]] being the
obstruction to the lift. more precisely, the inequality d1[[a]] 6= 0 in e1 means
[db] 6= d0[c] in e0. thus, db cannot be written as a -variation, even up to
the exterior derivative of a - closed term (ambiguity in the denition of b).
it is straightforward to see that in that case both a and b are non-trivial in
h(|d).

analogous to the decomposition (4.13) one has,

e1  ker d1  f1,

(4.16)

where f1 is a subspace of e1 supplementary to ker d1. the elements in im d1
are trivial in h(|d) and thus of no interest from the point of view of the
wess-zumino consistency condition.

to investigate the (non-trivial) -cocycle that can be lifted at least three

times one denes,

e2 = h(d1, e1),

(4.17)

and the dierential d2 through,

d2 : e2  e2, d2[[[a]]] = [[[dc]]],

(4.18)

where the triple brackets denote the classes in e2 and where c is dened
through the successive lifts da + b = 0, db + c = 0 (which exist since
d1[[a]] = 0). it is straightforward to verify that d2 is well-dened in e2, i.e.,
that the ambiguities in b and c play no role in e2. furthermore, a -cocycle
a such that d0[a] = 0 (so that [[a]]  e1 is well-dened) and d1[[a]] = 0
(so that [[[a]]]  e2 is well-dened) can be lifted a third time if and only if
d2[[[a]]] = 0. indeed, the relation d2[[[a]]] = 0 is equivalent to [[[dc]]] = 0, i.e.
dc = u + dv + dw, with v = 0 (this is the d0-term) and w + dt = 0, t = 0
(this is the d1-term). thus, by redening b as b  t and c as c  v  w, one

1proof: d0[a] = 0  da + b = 0  db = 0. hence, db is a -cocycle, which is clearly
annihilated by d0, d0[db] = [d2b] = 0. furthermore, the class of db in e1 does not depend
on the ambiguity in the denition of b, since if b is replaced by b + dm + u with u = 0,
then db is replaced by db + du which is equivalent to db in e1 (the class of du in e0 is
equal to d0[u] since u = 0, and this is zero in e1). the derivation property is also easily
veried, d1(ab) = (d1a)b + (1)a ad1b.

gets, dcredef ined = u. if a cannot be lifted a third time then it is non-trivial
in h(|d); this is also true for b and c.

note that we have again the decomposition,

e2  kerd2  f2,

(4.19)

where f2 is a subspace of e2 supplementary to kerd2.

to summarize, the above discussion shows that: 1) the elements of f0
are the non-trivial -cocycles in h(|d) that cannot be lifted at all; 2) the
elements of f1 are the non-trivial -cocycles in h(|d) that can be lifted
once; and 3) the elements of f2 are the non-trivial -cocycles in h(|d) that
can be lifted twice. furthermore, the successive lifts of elements of f1 and
f2 are non-trivial solution of the wess-zumino consistency condition.

4.2.4 lifts of elements of h() - general theory

one can proceed in the same way for the next lifts. one nds in that manner
a sequence of spaces er and dierentials dr with the properties:

1. er = h(er1, dr1).

2. there exists an antiderivation dr : er  er dened by dr[[. . . [x] . . . ]]
= [[. . . [db] . . . ]] for [[. . . [x] . . . ]]  er where [[. . . [db] . . . ]] is the class
of the -cocycle db in er and where b is dened through dx + c1 = 0,
dc1 + c2 = 0, ..., dcr1 + b = 0. similarly, [[. . . [x] . . . ]] denotes
the class of the -cocycle x in er (assumed to fulll the successive
conditions d0[x] = 0, d1[[x]] = 0 etc ... so as to dene an element of
er).

3. d2

r = 0.

4. a -cocycle x can be lifted r times if and only if d0[x] = 0, d1[[x]] = 0,
d2[[[x]]] = 0, ..., dr1[[. . . [x] . . . ]] = 0.
if dr[[. . . [x] . . . ]] 6= 0, the
-cocycle x cannot be lifted (r + 1) times and it is, along with its
successive lifts, not exact in h(|d).

5. a necessary and sucient condition for an element y in h() to be
exact in h(|d) is that there exists a k such that di[. . . [y ] . . . ] = 0,
(i = 1, 2, . . . , k  1) and [. . . [y ] . . . ] = dk[. . . [z] . . . ]. this implies in
particular dj[. . . [y ] . . . ] = 0 for all js.

6. conversely, if a -cocycle y fullls di[. . . [y ] . . . ] = 0 for i = 0, 1, ..., k1
and dk[. . . [y . . . ] 6= 0, then, it is not exact in h(|d). the condition

44

free theory: brst cohomology (part i)

is not necessary, however, because there are elements of h() that are
non trivial in h(|d) but which are annihilated by all dis. this is due
to the fact that there are no exterior form of degree higher than the
spacetime dimension. we shall come back to this point below.

the meaning of the integer k for which y = dkz in item 5 (with y 6=
di(something) for i < k) is as follows (we shall drop the multiple brackets
when no confusion can arise). if the -cocycle a is in im d0, then a = db + c,
where b is also a -cocycle. if a is a non-zero element of e1 in the image of
d1, then again a = db + c, but b is now not a cocycle of  since a would
then be in im d0 and thus zero in e1. instead, one has b + d = 0 where 
is a cocycle of  ( = 0) which is not trivial in h(|d). more generally, k
characterizes the length of the descent below b in a = db + c, b + d = 0
etc.

the proof of items 1 to 4 proceeds recursively. assume that the dier-
ential algebras (ei, di) have been constructed up to order r  1, with the
properties 2 through 4. then, one denes the next space er as in 1. let
x be an element of er, and let x be one of the -cocycles such that the
class [[. . . [x] . . . ]] in er is precisely x. since x can be lifted r times, one
has a sequence dx + c1 = 0, ..., dcr1 + b = 0. the ambiguity in x is
x  x + a + du0 + du1 +    + dur1, where u0 is a -cocycle (this is the
d0-exact term), u1 is the rst lift of a -cocycle (this is the d1-exact term)
etc. setting u = u0 + u1 +    ur1, one sees that the ambiguity in x is of the
form x  x + a + du. on the other hand, the ambiguity in the successive
lifts takes the form c1  c1 + m1, where m1 is a -cocycle that can be lifted
r 1 times, c2  c2 +n1 +m2, where n1 descends on m1 and m2 is a -cocycle
that can be lifted r  2 times, ..., and nally b  b + a1 + a2 +    + ar1 + ar,
where a1 descends (r  1) times, on m1, a2 descends (r  2) times, on m2,
etc, and ar is a -cocycle.

the element xr  db is clearly a cocycle of , which is annihilated by
d0 and the successive derivations dk because dxr = 0 exactly and not just
up to -exact terms. the ambiguity in the successive lifts of x plays no
role in the class of xr in er, since it can (suggestively) be written db 
db + dr1m1 + dr2m2 +    + d1mr1 + d0ar. thus, the map dr is well-
dened as a map from er to er. it is clearly nilpotent since dxr = 0. it
is also a derivation, because one may rewrite the lift equations for x as
(x + c1 + c2 +    + b) = drx where

 =  + d.

(4.20)

let y be another element of er and e1, e2, ... its successive lifts. then,
(y + e1 + e2 +    + ) = dry . because  is a derivation, one has [(x +

4.2 antield independent solutions

45

c1 +    + b)(y + e1 +    + )] = (drx)y + (1)x xdry + forms of higher
form-degree, which implies dr(xy ) = (drx)y + (1)x xdry : dr is also an
odd derivation and thus a dierential. this establishes properties 2 and 3.

to prove property 4, one observes that x can be lifted once more if and
only if one may choose its successive lifts such that db is -exact. this is
equivalent to stating that drx is zero in er. properties 5 and 6 are rather
obvious:
if a is a -cocycle which is exact in h(|d), a = db + c, then
a = dkm where k is the length of the descent associated with b + dn = 0,
which has bottom m.

as shown in [57, 58], the above construction may be elegantly captured
in an exact couple [59]. the detailed analysis of this exact couple and the
proof of the above results using directly the powerful tools oered by this
couple may be found in [58, 60, 61].

one has, for each r, the vector space isomorphisms,

er  ker dr  fr  im dr  er+1  fr,

(4.21)

where fr is a subspace supplementary to ker dr in er. thus,

e0  k=r1

k=0 fk k=r1

k=0

im dk  er.

(4.22)

because there is no form of degree higher than the spacetime dimension,
dn = 0 (dna has form-degree equal to f ormdeg(a) + n + 1). therefore,
en = en+1 = en+2 = . . . . this implies

e0  k=n1

k=0 fk k=n1

k=0

im dk  en.

(4.23)

the elements in any of the fks are non trivial bottoms of the descent which
can be lifted exactly k times. all the elements above them in the descent
are also non trivial solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition. the
elements in im dk are bottoms which are trivial in h(|d) and which therefore
dene trivial solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition. finally,
the elements in en are bottoms that can be lifted all the way up to form
degree n. these are non trivial in h(|d), since they are not equal to dim
for some i and m. the dierence between the elements in fk and those
in en is that the former cannot be lifted all the way up to form-degree n:
one meets an obstruction before, which is dka (if a  fk). by contrast, the
elements in en can be lifted all the way up to form degree n. this somewhat
unpleasant distinction between -cocycles that are non-trivial in h(|d) will
be removed below, where we shall assign an obstruction to the elements of
en in some appropriate higher dimensional space.

in order to solve the wess-zumino consistency condition, our task is now

to determine explicitly the spaces er and fr.

46

4.2.5

invariant poincare lemma  small algebra  uni-
versal algebra

to that end, we rst work out the cohomology of d0 in e0  h(). let u
be a -cocycle. without loss of generality, we may assume that u takes the
form

u =x pii

(4.24)

where the i are polynomials in the last undierentiated ghosts of ghosts
c a
pa and where the pi are polynomials in the eld strength components and
their derivatives, with coecients that involve dx and x. the pi are called
gauge-invariant polynomials. a direct calculation using the fact that the

d-variation of the last ghosts is -exact yields du = p(dpi)i + v. the

r.h.s of the previous equation is -exact if and only if dpi = 0.

the rst consequence is that f0 is isomorphic to the space of polynomials

of the form,

f0  {u =x piiwith dpi 6= 0 and pi  pi + dqi}.

(4.25)

f0 exhausts all the solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition in
form degree < n which descend trivially.

now, if pi = dri where ri is also a gauge invariant polynomial, then u
is d-exact modulo , u = da + b, with a = 0. conversely, if u = da + b
with a = 0, then pi is d-exact in the space of invariant polynomials. thus,
the class of u (in e0) is a non trivial cocycle of d0 if and only if pi is a non
trivial cocycle of the invariant cohomology of d which we now calculate.

since we are interested in lifts of -cocycles from form-degree k to form-
degree k + 1, we shall investigate the d-invariant cohomology only in form-
degree strictly smaller than the spacetime dimension n. this will be assumed
throughout the remainder of this section. [in form-degree n, there is clearly
further invariant cohomology since any invariant n-form is annihilated by d,
even when it cannot be written as the d of an invariant form].

invariant poincare lemma

in the literature, the result covering the invariant cohomology of d is known
as the invariant poincare lemma. it is contained in the following theorem
which we formulate in the presence of antields because we will also apply it
further on the antield dependent solutions of the wess-zumino consistency
condition.

4.2 antield independent solutions

47

theorem 6. let hk be the subspace of form degree k of the nite dimen-
sional algebra h of polynomials in the curvature (pa + 1)-forms h a, h =
khk. one has

and

h k,inv

j

(d) = 0, k < n, j > 0

h k,inv

0

(d) = hk, k < n.

(4.26)

(4.27)

thus, in particular, if a = a() with da = 0, antighost a > 0 and deg
a < n then a = db with b = b(). and if a has antighost number zero, then
a = p (h a) + db, where p (h a) is a polynomial in the curvature forms and
b = b([h]).

this generalizes the result established for 1-forms in [62, 63, 49].

proof:

let us rst show that in antighost number > 0 the invariant coho-
mology of d is trivial. let  be a solution of d = 0 with  = (). we
decompose  according to the number of derivatives of the antields:

 = 0 + . . . + k.

(4.28)

with d written as d = d + d where d acts only on the antields and
d on all the others variables, equation d = 0 then implies dk = 0.
according to theorem 5 we have, k = dk1() (the fact that all
the antields and their derivatives appear in the  is crucial here) and
therefore by redening in  the terms of order less than k, one can get
rid of k, so that  = 0 + . . . + k1 + dk1. in the same way, one
shows that all the i up to 1 can be removed from  by adding the
d-exact term di1. finally, 0 has to vanish because the condition
d0 = 0 implies 0 = 0(x, [h]) and we are in antighost > 0.

we now prove that in antighost number 0 the invariant cohomol-
ogy of d is exhausted by the polynomials in the curvatures. we rst
establish the result for one p-form and then extend the analysis to an
arbitrary system of p-forms.

so let us start with one p-form. it can be either of odd or even
degree. let us begin with the odd-case. because we have dpj = 0 and

48

pj = 0 we can build a descent equation as follows:

dp k

j = 0  p k

j1 + dakj1

(4.31)

(4.32)

(4.33)

where k is a constant. in the case of one p-form of odd degree, the
last equation of the descent and theorem 3 tell us that akj1
=
akp1
= mj cp where mj is a polynomial in the eld strength com-
p
ponents and their derivatives. if we substitute this in (4.32) we obtain
dmj cp + (akj
j1  mj cp1) = 0. this implies dmj = 0 (theo-
rem 3 again). because the form degree of mj is strictly less than k
(the form degree of pj ), we make the recurrence hypothesis that the
theorem holds for mj , i.e, mj = mj (h). akp1
then lifts with no
ambiguity (except for  and d exact terms which are irrelevant) up to
ak2
1 = mj (h)c1. equation (4.30) then implies ak1
0 = mj (h)b + rj
where rj is a polynomial in the eld strength components and their
derivatives. therefore we have p k
j = mj (h)h + drj which proves
the theorem for one p-form of odd degree.

in the case where the p-form is of even degree the proof proceed as
follows. we rst construct the same descent as previously with akj1
this time of the form akj1
p. just as in the the odd
case, (4.32) implies dmj = 0. we thus make the recurrence hypothesis
mj = mj (h) = h +  where  and  are constants. therefore,
akpl1
p is -exact modulo d.

one can see this by using the horizontality condition (3.40). indeed,

in that case, the bottom a0
now show that if l > 1 then  = 0.

(using eq.

p(l1)1) =

obstruction is not present. the bottom cp then yields p k
j = k +

let us nally prove the theorem for an arbitrary system of p-forms.
we label one of the p-form with a and the rest with b and decompose
pj according to the number of derivatives of the eld strengths of
the p-form labeled by a: pj = p0 + . . . + pk. because dpj = 0
we have dapk = 0, where da only acts on the elds of the sector
labeled by a. using the theorem in the case of a single p-form we
get pk = dark1 + v where v is only present for k = 0 because
it only depends on the sector a through ha and on the sector b
through the eld strengths and their derivatives. thus, except when
k = 0, pk can be removed from pj by subtracting the coboundary
drk1  pj = v up to trivial terms. we now expand v in powers

of ha: v = p(ha)kvk. the condition dv = 0 then implies dvk = 0.

by induction on the number of p-forms occurring in vk we obtain the
desired result.

if the local forms are not taken to be explicitly x-dependent, equation (4.27)
must be replaced by

h k,inv

0

(d) = (  h)k.

(4.34)

small algebra

from now on, we restrict our attention to the algebra of x-dependent space-
time forms p. in section 4.2.7 we comment on how the results are aected
when the analysis is pursued in p.

theorem 6 implies, according to the general analysis of the descent equa-
tion given above, that the only bottoms u (u = 0) that can be lifted at
least once can be expressed in terms of exterior products of the curvature
forms h a and the last ghosts of ghosts (up to trivial redenitions). out of
the innitely many generators of h(), only h a and c a

pa survive in e1.

because the objects that survive the rst step in the lift can be expressed
in terms of forms, it is convenient to introduce the so-called small algebra
a generated in the exterior product by the exterior forms, ba, h a, c a
pak and
dc a
pak (k = 0, ..., pa  1). this algebra is stable under  and d. denoting by
esmall

indeed, let q be the map from esmall
to e1 that assigns to a cohomological

 b fullls a = 0
and d0a = 0 and so denes of course an element of e1). it follows from the
above theorem that the map q is surjective since any class in e1 possesses
a representative in the small algebra. the map q is also injective because
there is no non trivial class in esmall
that becomes trivial in e1. if the small-

1

algebra -cocycle r =p pii with pi, i  b can be written as r = du + t

with u and v in the big algebra and u a -cocycle, then r is actually zero.
indeed, if u = 0 we have, u = qi i + m. this implies, pii = dqii + t
and thus pi = dqi which is impossible according to theorem 6.

in fact, it is easy to see that we also have ek  esmall

indeed, suppose the result holds for esmall
k1 and ek1 and let q be the bijective
map between these two spaces. if a  esmall

(4.38)

furthermore, because esmall

so by denition,

dk1[a]ek = [dck1]ek.

by virtue of this result, one can equivalently compute the spaces esmall
instead of the spaces ek in order to obtain the elements of h() which can
be lifted k times and which are not dk-exact.

ck+1 = 0. one may ask whether or not the obstruction to the lift of ck can

k

4.2 antield independent solutions

51

be removed when the ambiguities are not restricted to the small algebra?
the answer is negative for the following reason. the ambiguities in any of
the ci (i < k) have to be lifted at least once; so up to trivial terms they can
be supposed to be in the small algebra as well as their successive lifts. this
implies that the ambiguity in ck is ck  ck + m + u0 with m in a and u0 a
-closed term. ck can be lifted if it is possible to adjust m and u0 so that
d(ck + m) + du0 = r. however, the same argument used in the proof of the
injectivity of the map q from esmall

to e1 shows that this is impossible.

1

we can summarize the above discussion in the following theorem:

theorem 7. there is no loss of generality in investigating in the small al-
gebra the solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition that descend
non trivially.

universal algebra

the small algebra a involves only exterior forms, exterior products and ex-
terior derivatives.
it does remember the spacetime dimension since its
generators are not free: any product of generators with form-degree exceed-
ing the spacetime dimension vanishes.

it is useful to drop this relation and to work in the algebra freely gen-
erated by the potentials, the ghosts and their exterior derivatives with the
sole condition that these commute or anti-commute (graded commutative al-
gebra) but without imposing any restriction on the maximally allowed form
degree [58, 64]. this algebra is called the universal algebra and denoted by
u. in this algebra, the cohomology of d is trivial in all form-degrees and the
previous theorems on the invariant cohomology of d are also valid in form-
degree  n. furthermore, one can sharpen the condition for a cocycle in
h() to be non trivial in h(|d).

theorem 8. a necessary and sucient condition for x  h() to be non-
trivial in h(|d) is that there exists r such that drx 6= 0. that is, the lift
of x must be obstructed at some stage. (for the equation drx 6= 0 to make
sense, dix must vanish for i < r. here also we denote by the same letter
x  e0 and its representative in er).

proof: the decomposition of en is now non-trivial since da does not nec-
essarily vanish even when a is a n-form. thus, dn is not necessarily
zero and the procedure of lifting can be pursued above form-degree
n. suppose that one encounters no obstruction in the lifting of x.
that is, one can go all the way up to ghost number zero, the last two

52

free theory: brst cohomology (part i)

equations being dck + b = 0 (with b of ghost number zero) and db = 0
(so b lifts to zero). then, one can write b = dm since the cohomology
of d is trivial in any form-degree in the universal algebra u (except
for the constants, which cannot arise here since b involves the elds).
the triviality of the top-form b implies the triviality in h(|d) of all
the elements below it. thus, a necessary condition for the bottom to
be non trivial in h(|d) is that one meets an obstruction in the lift at
some stage. the condition is also clearly sucient.

one can summarize our results as follows:

theorem 9. (generalized transgression lemma) let x  e0 be a non-
trivial element of h(|d). then there exists an integer r such that dix = 0,
i < r and drx = y 6= 0. the element y is dened through the chain
dx + c1 = 0, ..., dcr1 + cr = 0, dcr + cr+1 = y , where the elements
ci  u (i = 1, r + 1) are chosen so as to go all the way up to cr+1. one
has y = 0 and y should properly viewed as an element of er (reecting the
ambiguities in the lift). one calls the obstruction y to a further lift of x
the (generalized) transgression of x. the element x and its transgression
have opposite statistics.

this is the direct generalization of the analysis of [58] to the case of
p-forms. primitive elements of e0 are those that have form-degree zero
and for which the transgression has ghost number zero, i.e., they are the
elements that can be lifted all the way up to ghost number zero (that can
be transgressed). we refer to [58, 65, 66] for more background information
applicable to the yang-mills case.

because the space en and the next ones can be further decomposed in

the universal algebra,

en  im dn  en+1  fn, en+1  etc

(4.40)

where the decomposition for a given -cocycle ultimately ends at form-degree
equal to the ghost number, one has

the rst term on the r.h.s (4.44) is annihilated by dp1 while the second term
is not and therefore denes an element of fp1. the space fp1 can be taken
to be the space generated by the monomials of this symmetry type (not
annihilated by dp1), tensored by the algebra generated by the curvatures and
last ghosts of ghosts of higher degree. together with their successive lifts,
the elements in fp1 provide all the non-trivial solutions of the wess-zumino

consistency condition which are involved in descents whose bottoms can be
lifted exactly p1 times.

in the case where the h a1

1 are commuting and the c a1

one simply exchanges the roles of ai and bj in the previous discussion.

p2 and h a2

similarly, one nds that the next non-vanishing dierential is dp2. the
generators c a2
2 drop from the cohomology of dp2 while those of
higher degree remain. a space fp2 can be constructed along exactly the
same lines as the space fp1 above and characterizes the solutions of the
wess-zumino consistency condition involved in descents whose bottoms can
be lifted exactly p2 times.

more generally, the non-vanishing dierentials are dpk. they are dened
(in epk, which is isomorphic to the algebra generated by the curvatures of
form-degree > pk1 + 1 and the last ghosts of ghosts of ghost number > pk1)
through

and

(4.46)

pk and h ak

the generators c ak
k disappear in cohomology. the subspace fpk
is again easily constructed along the previous lines. together with their
successive lifts, the elements in fpk provide all the non-trivial solutions of
the wess-zumino consistency condition which are involved in descents whose
bottoms can be lifted exactly pk times.

along with f0 (see (4.25)), the fpis constructed in this section provide in
form degree < n all the non-trivial -cocycle remain non-trivial as elements
of h(|d). together with their successive lifts they form a complete set of
representatives of h(|d) involved in non-trivial descents.

example: let us illustrate this discussion in the case of the simple model with
one free 1-form a and one free 2-form b considered in section 4.2.2. the
space esmall
is isomorphic to the space of polynomials in the curvature-forms
f , h and the last ghosts of ghosts a1, b2. the dierential dsmall
vanishes
so e1  esmall
. one next nds d1a1 = f , d1f = 0, d1b2 = 0 and d1h = 0.
the space e2 is isomorphic to the space of polynomials in b2 and h. one
may take for f1 the space of polynomials linear in a1. these can be lifted
exactly once, their lifts being linear in a and a1,

a  f1  a = a1x(b2)lf kh m (m = 0 or 1).

(4.47)

4.2 antield independent solutions

then, one gets

with

da + b = 0,

b =x(cid:0)a(b2)lf kh m + la1b1(b2)l1f kh m(cid:1).

they cannot be further lifted since the obstruction d1a = p(b2)l f k+1h m

does not vanish. the above as and bs are the most general solutions of the
wess-zumino consistency condition involved in descents of length 1.

55

(4.48)

(4.49)

the dierential d2 in e2 is given by d2b2 = h, d2h = 0. because
h 2 = 0, one may take for f2 the space of polynomials in b2 only. for those,
the descent reads,

 = lb1(b2)l1

,  = 0,
, d +  = 0,

 = lb(b2)l1 +

, d +  = 0.

(4.50)

the elements of the form ,  or  are the most general solutions of the
wess-zumino consistency condition involved in descents of length 2. with
the solutions involved in descents of length 1 and those that do not descend
(i.e., which are strictly annihilated by ), they exhaust all the (antield-
independent) solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition.

a straightforward consequence of our discussion is the following theorem,

which will prove useful in the analysis of antield dependent solutions.

theorem 10. let  be a -cocycle of the form

 = (h as

ps )(c ak

where  vanishes if h as
which fullls,

s and c as

s c as
ps are set equal to zero (no constant term) and

k ), k > s

(4.51)

(i.e. the rst possible obstruction in the lift of  is absent). then,  is trivial
in h(|d).

dps = 0.

(4.52)

proof: the proof is direct: one has  = dps for some (h as

ps ) since
dps is acyclic in the space of the (h as
ps ) with no constant term.
thus  is dps-exact,  = dps(); so  is the rst obstruction to the
further lift of  and as such, is trivial.

s , c as

s c as

the theorem applies in particular when  is an arbitrary polynomial of
strictly positive degree in the curvatures h as
s .

56

4.2.7 results in p

in the algebra of x-independent spacetime forms p, the analysis proceeds
similarly as in p.

because of (4.34), we now dene the small algebra a as the algebra
generated by the exterior products of the forms h a, ba, c a
pak (k =
0, . . . pa  1) but also dx since we now need the constant forms. by exactly
the same arguments used in p, one shows that the isomorphisms esmall

ek, k  1 still hold in p and that one cannot remove obstructions to lifts
by going to the big algebra. therefore, theorem 7 remains valid in p.

pak, dc a

k

the universal algebra is then dened as the algebra freely generated by
the exterior products of the forms h a, ba, c a
pak (k = 0, . . . pa  1)
and dx without any restriction on the maximally allowed form degree. in
that algebra the cohomology of d and the invariant cohomology of d are
respectively given by the constant forms and (4.34) (in all form-degrees in-
cluding form-degrees  n). theorems 8 and 9 are then proved as they are
in p.

pak, dc a

therefore, the calculation of the spaces esmall

in p can proceed as in
section 4.2.6. the only dierence is that the fa1...akb1...bm in (4.44) are now
constant forms instead of just constants.

k

note that even in p, the constant forms can be eliminated by requiring

lorentz invariance.

4.2.8 counterterms and anomalies

in this section we summarize the above results by giving explicitly the anti-
eld-independent counterterms and anomalies: h (n,0)(|d) and h (n,1)(|d).
these can be of two types: (i) those that descend trivially (type a) and
can be assumed to be strictly annihilated by ; they are described by h()
up to trivial terms; and (ii) those that lead to a non-trivial descent (type
b) and can be assumed to be in the small algebra modulo solutions of the
previous type. for small ghost number, it turns out to be more convenient
to determine the solutions of type b directly from the obstructions sitting
above them rather than from the bottom. that this procedure, which works
in the universal algebra, yields all the solutions, is guaranteed by the analysis
of section 4.2.5.

the following results apply equally to p and p since for the counterterms
and anomalies we impose lorentz-invariance which eliminates the constant
forms.

4.2 antield independent solutions

57

counterterms and anomalies of type a

the counterterms that lead to a trivial descent involve in general the individ-
ual components of the gauge-invariant eld strengths and their derivatives
and cannot generically be expressed as exterior products of the forms f or
h. they are the gauge-invariant polynomials introduced above and read
explicitly,

a = a([h a])dnx.

(4.53)

in order to be non-trivial in h(|d) the above cocycles must satisfy the
condition a 6= db which is equivalent to the condition that the variational
derivatives of a with respect to the elds do not identically vanish. we
have assumed that the spacetime forms dx occur only through the product
dx0dx1    dxn1  dnx as this is required by lorentz-invariance.

the anomalies that lead to a trivial descent are sums of terms of the form
a = p c dnx where p is a gauge-invariant polynomial and c is a last ghost of
ghost with ghost number one. these anomalies exist only for a theory with
1-forms. one has explicitly

a = pa([h a])c a
1

(4.54)

where a runs over the 1-forms. a will be trivial if and only if p = dr where
r is an invariant polynomial or if pa = pa(h a) with pah a = 0. indeed,
suppose that a is trivial, i.e., pac a = c + de. by acting with  on this
equation we see that e satises e+dm = 0. we can thus decompose e as the
sum of an element of h(|d) which descends trivially and a term v in the small
algebra which is the lift of a -cocycle: e = ra([h a])c a
1 + v. this implies
de = drac a
1 + u and thus pa([h a]) = dra([h a]) + qa(h a)
where qah a = 0 (see eq. (4.62) in the section on anomalies of type b).

1 + qa(h a)c a

the existence of such anomalies - which cannot generically be expressed
as exterior products of curvatures and ghosts - was pointed out in [67] for
yang-mills gauge models with u(1) factors.

counterterms of type b

the solutions that lead to a non trivial descent can be assumed to live in
the small algebra, i.e., can be expressed in terms of exterior products of the
elds, the ghosts (which are all exterior forms) and their exterior derivatives
(modulo solutions of type a). if a is a non-trivial solution of the wess-zumino
consistency condition with ghost number zero, then da 6= 0 (in the universal
algebra). since a has ghost number zero, it is the top of the descent and da

58

free theory: brst cohomology (part i)

is the obstruction to a further lift. because da is a -cocycle, it is a gauge-
invariant polynomial. it must, in addition, be d-closed but not d-exact in the
space of gauge-invariant polynomials since otherwise, a could be redened
to be of type a. therefore, da is an element of the invariant cohomology
of d and it will be easier to determine a directly from the obstruction da
rather than from the bottom of the descent because one knows the invariant
cohomology of d.

thus we may assume that,

da = p (h) = dq(h, b)

(4.55)

where q is linear in the forms ba, and so up to trivial terms,

a = ra(h b)ba.

(4.56)

note that up to a d-exact term, one may in fact assume that a involves
only the potentials ba of the curvatures of smaller form-degree present in
p . these are the familiar chern-simons terms, which exist provided one can
match the spacetime dimension n with a polynomial in the curvatures h a
and the forms ba, linear in ba.

the whole descent associated with a is generated through the russian

formula [55, 50, 56, 20]

p = a(h, b)
 = d + 

ba = ba + c a

1 +    c a
pa,

which follows from the horizontability condition (eq. (3.40)),

 ba = h a.

(4.57)
(4.58)
(4.59)

(4.60)

by expanding (4.57) according to the ghost number, one gets the whole tower
of descent equations. the bottom takes the form ra(h b)c a
pa and is linear
in the last ghosts of ghosts associated with the forms of smaller form degree
involved in p . that the bottoms should take this form might have been
anticipated since these are the only bottoms with the right degrees that can
be lifted all the way to form-degree n. the non-triviality of the bottom
implies also the non-triviality of the whole tower.

it is rather obvious that the chern-simons terms are solutions of the
wess-zumino consistency condition. the main result here is that these are
the only solutions that descend non trivially (up to solutions of type a).

4.2 antield independent solutions

59

anomalies of type b

the anomalies a of type b can themselves be of two types. they can arise
from an obstruction that lives one dimension higher or from an obstruction
that lives two dimensions higher. in the rst case, the obstruction da has
form degree n + 1 and ghost number 1. this occurs only for models with
1-forms since other models have no -cohomology in ghost number one. in
the other case, the anomaly can be lifted once, da + b = 0. the obstruction
db to a further lift is then a (n + 2)-form of ghost number 0.

in the rst case, the obstruction da reads

da + (something) = pa(h)c a
1

(4.61)

where a runs over the 1-forms. the right-hand side of (4.61) is necessarily
the d1 of something. indeed, it cannot be the dk (k > 1) of something, say m,
since this would make m trivial: the rst obstruction to the lift of m would
have to vanish and m involves explicitly the variables of the 1-form sector
(see theorem 10 above). this implies

pa(h)c a

1 = cab(h)h ac b
1 c a

1 = d1( 1

1 , cab(h) = cba(h)

(4.62)

so that pa(h)c a
1 . one thus needs at least two 1-forms
to construct such solutions. if cab(h) involves the curvatures h a of the 1-
forms, it must be such that (4.62) is not zero. the anomaly following from
(4.61) is

2cab(h)c a

and the associated descent is generated through

a = cab(h)bac a
1

cab(h)h ac a

1 = (

cab(h) ba bb)

1
2

(4.63)

(4.64)

in the second case, the obstruction p  h inv(d) is a polynomial in h a
of form-degree n + 2, which can be written p = dq with q linear in the
potentials associated to the curvatures of lowest degree present in p . the
solution a and the descent are obtained from the russian formula (4.57),
exactly as for the counterterms,

a = ra(h b)c a
1 .

(4.65)

they are linear in the ghosts and exist only for models with forms of
degree > 1 which are the only ones that can occur in p since otherwise a
is either trivial or of type a. indeed, if variables from the 1-form sector are
present in p , then p = d1a (if p is non trivial) and the descent has only
two steps. but this really means that a is the bottom of the descent and is
actually of type a.

4.2.9 conclusions

in this section, we have derived the general solution of the antield-independ-
ent wess-zumino consistency condition for models involving p-forms. we
have justied in particular why one can assume that the solutions can be
expressed in terms of exterior products of the elds, the ghosts (which are
all exterior forms) and their exterior derivatives, when these solutions ap-
pear in non trivial descents. this is not obvious to begin with since there
are solutions that are not expressible in terms of forms (those that descend
trivially) and justify the usual calculations made for determining the anoma-
lies. once one knows that the solutions involved in non trivial descents can
be expressed in terms of forms (up to solutions that descend trivially), one
can straightforwardly determine their explicit form in ghost numbers zero
and one. this has been done in the last section where all counterterms and
anomalies have been classied. the counterterms are either strictly gauge
invariant and given by (4.53) or of the chern-simons type (when available)
and given by (4.56).

the anomalies are also either strictly annihilated by , or lead to a non-
trivial descent. the rst type generalizes the anomalies of dixon and ramon
medrano [67] and are given by (4.54). the more familiar anomalies with a
non trivial descent are listed in eqs. (4.63) and (4.65).

the method applies also to other values of the ghost number, which are

relevant in the analysis of the antield-dependent cohomology.

this result is also valid for more general lagrangians than (3.2). indeed,
if one adds to the lagrangian of free p-forms interactions which are gauge
invariant ((4.53) or (4.56)), then the gauge transformations of the resulting
theory are identical to those of the free theory. therefore, the denition of
the longitudinal exterior derivative  is unchanged and the results are not
modied.

as we will show in the next section, the natural appearance of exterior
forms holds also for the characteristic cohomology: all higher order conser-
vation laws are naturally expressed in terms of exterior products of eld
strengths and duals to the eld strengths. it is this property that makes the
gauge symmetry-deforming consistent interactions for p-form gauge elds ex-
pressible also in terms of exterior forms and exterior products.

4.3 antield dependent solutions

we now turn our attention to the antield dependent solutions of the wess-
zumino consistency condition.

4.3.1 preliminary results

any antield dependent solution of equation (4.1) may be decomposed ac-
g,q with q 6= 0.2
cording to the antighost number an
g,1 + . . . + an
when this is done, the wess-zumino consistency condition,

g,0 + an

g = an

sak

g + dbk1

g+1 = 0,

splits as,

a0 + a1 + db0 = 0,
a1 + a2 + db1 = 0,

...

aq1 + aq + dbq1 = 0,
aq + dbq = 0,

(4.66)

(4.67)
(4.68)

(4.69)
(4.70)

where we have dropped the indices labeling the ghost numbers and form
degrees (which are xed) and we have performed the decomposition bk1
g+1 =
g+1,0+. . .+bk1
bk1
g+1,q (because of the algebraic poincare lemma, we may assume
that up to a d-exact term, the expansion of bk1
g+1 according to the antighost
number stops at order q).

these equations resemble the descent equations used in the analysis of
antield independent brst cocycles. the bottom equation now denes an
element of h(|d) which we denote e0. in order to lift this cocycle, one needs
to analyze whether or not its -variation is trivial in h(|d). to address this
question we dene the map 0 : e0  e0 as follows,

0[aq] = [aq],

(4.71)

where [ ] denotes the class in h(|d). this map is well-dened because: 1)
aq = aq = dbq = dbq (so aq is a  mod d cocycle; 2) (rq + dcq) =
(rq)  d(cq) (so  maps a coboundary on a coboundary). furthermore

2in this section we limit our attention to solutions of the wess-zumino consistency
condition in form degree n. in particular, this applies to consistent interactions, counter-
terms, anomalies and solutions related to the analysis of the gauge invariance of conserved
currents. other values of the form-degree are treated along the same lines.

62

free theory: brst cohomology (part i)

2
0 = 0 so 0 is a dierential and one can dene its cohomology. cocycles of
0 are elements of h(|d) which can be lifted at least once. by contrast, if
0[aq] 6= 0 then one cannot lift aq to construct the component of antighost
number q  1 of an
g . furthermore, if [aq] = 0[cq+1] then one can eliminate aq
from an
g by the addition of trivial terms and the redenition of the terms of
lower antighost numbers. the interesting aq involved in the construction of
brst-cocycles are therefore the representatives of h(e0, 0).

to analyze the next lifts, one can dene a sequence of spaces er and
dierentials r which satisfy similar properties as those encountered in the
standard descent equations:

1. er  h(er1, r1).

2. there exist a map r : er  er which is dened by r[[. . . [aq] . . . ]] =
[[. . . [aqr] . . . ]], for [[. . . [aq] . . . ]]  er where [[. . . [aqr] . . . ]] is the
class of the  mod d cocycle aqr and where aqr is dened by the
equations (4.67)-(4.70).

3. 2

r = 0.

4. a  mod d cocycle aq can be lifted q times if and only if 0[aq] =
0, 1[[aq]] = 0, . . . , q1[[. . . [aq] . . . ]] = 0. such a  mod d cocycle and
its successive lifts constitute the components of a brst cocycle.
if
r[[. . . [aq] . . . ]] 6= 0 (r < q), the  mod d cocycle cannot be lifted
r + 1 times and it is not an s mod d coboundary up to terms of lower
antighost number.

5. one can eliminate aq from an

g by the addition of trivial terms and
the redenition of terms of lower antighost numbers if and only if there
exists a k such i[[. . . [aq] . . . ]] = 0, (i = 0, . . . , k1) and [[. . . [aq] . . . ]] =
k[[. . . [aq+k+1] . . . ]].

the proof of these properties proceed as in the case of the standard descent
equations.

according to these properties, the  mod d cocycles which yield non-
trivial brst cocycles belong to er  h(er1, r), r. this condition seems
awkward to work with since it implies the calculation of an innite number
of cohomologies er. the reason for this is that the antighost number is not
bounded. however, for a large class of theories such as linear theories and
normal theories [27] the cohomologies er coincide for r > k where k is a
nite number. this result is a consequence of the fact that their character-
istic cohomology (to be dened below) vanishes above a certain value of the
antighost number.

4.3 antield dependent solutions

63

there is thus a strong analogy between the analysis of antield inde-
pendent and antield dependent solutions of the wess-zumino consistency
condition. however, compared to the dr, the operators r are not antideriva-
tions. indeed they are maps in vector spaces er and not in algebras. for
instance, if aq and bq are representatives of h(|d)  e0 their product is
not necessarily in e0. the product of two elements of er is therefore not an
internal operation and one cannot even speak of derivations. because of this
particularity, we cannot calculate the spaces ek as we did for the ek. instead
we will have to lift the possible  mod d cocycles aq by hand and nd those
which can be lifted all the way up to produce brst cocycles.

before we do so, we begin by characterizing the bottoms aq as much as
possible. to this end, we rst prove that without changing the class of ak
g in
h(s|d) we can replace (4.70) by the simpler eq. aq = 0. to prove this, we
use the following theorem:

theorem 11. let ak be a -closed solution of dak = bk+1 of form degree
k < n and antighost > 0. then, ak = dck1 + bk, with ck1 in h(). in
other words, the cohomology in antighost > 0 and form degree < n of d in
h() vanishes.

proof:

since ak is -closed we have ak = pj ()j + mk. equation dak =
bk+1 then implies dpj j = (bk+1 +dmk +pj j), where dj + j =
0. therefore we have dpj = 0 and using theorem 6, pj = dqj . thus,
ak = dqj j + mk = d(qj j) + (qj j + mk) which proves the
theorem.

theorem 11 now allows us assume aq = 0. indeed, if we act on (4.70) with 
we can build a descent equation. however, the bottom of this descent satises
the condition of theorem 11 which implies that it is trivial in h(|d) and
thus that aq cannot descend non-trivially. therefore we have aq = pj ()j +
mq + drq = pj ()j + smq + drq mq. because mq is of antighost number
q  1 we see that in each class of h(s|d) there is a representative satisfying
aq = pj ()j .

the next equation we have to examine is (4.69). if we substitute aq in

this equation we obtain,

pj j + aq1 + dbq1 = 0.

(4.72)

by acting on this equation with  we can once more build a descent equation
for bq1.
if q  1 > 0 then again the bottom satises the conditions of

64

free theory: brst cohomology (part i)

theorem 11 and therefore bq1 = nj j + hq1 + dlq1. if we substitute this
form in (4.72) we obtain the condition,

if q = 1 then we have for the descent,

pj + dnj = 0.

pjj + a0 + db0 = 0,
b0 + dr0 = 0,

...

m0 = 0.

(4.73)

(4.74)
(4.75)

(4.76)
(4.77)

according to our analysis of h(|d), we know that b0 can be written as
b0 = nj j + b0, where b0 is an element of h(|d) which does not descend
trivially and which is in the small algebra. thus we have db0 = dnj j 
(nj j) + rj (h a)j + c0, where rj (h a)j + c0 = db0. the condition
(4.72) therefore becomes,

pj + dnj + rj (h a) = 0.

(4.78)

in the algebra of x-independent forms p, one easily obtains rj = 0 by
counting the number of derivatives of h. the above equation therefore
reduces to (4.73). in the algebra of x-dependent forms p, this is no longer
true and we shall comment later on the consequences of this.

a solution of (4.73) is called trivial when it is of the form, pj = mj +drj
where mj and rj are polynomials in the . such solutions are irrelevant in
the study of brst cocycles because the corresponding aq can be eliminated
from an
g . indeed we have, aq = (mj + drj )j = (mj j) + d(rj j) +
(rj j) = s(mj j + rj j) + d(rjj)  rj j so we may assume that the
expansion of an

g stops at order q  1 in the antighost number.

we therefore need to solve equation (4.73) for invariant polynomials pj
and identify two solutions which dier by trivial terms of the form mj +drj .
these equivalence classes dene the invariant  mod d cohomology de-
noted h inv(|d). this cohomology is related to the so-called characteristic
cohomology and both will be calculated in the next section.

to summarize, we have shown in this section that the antield dependent
solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition can be chosen of the form
aq = pj j where pj has to be a non-trivial element of h inv(|d) (for q = 1
this is only valid in the algebra of x-independent forms).

in the next chapter we study the characteristic cohomology in detail and

return to the calculation of h(s|d) in chapter 6.

chapter 5

characteristic cohomology

5.1 introduction

the characteristic cohomology [68] plays a central role in the analysis of
any local eld theory. the easiest way to dene this cohomology, which is
contained in the so-called vinogradov c-spectral sequence [38, 39, 69, 70, 43,
71], is to start with the more familiar notion of conserved current. consider
a dynamical theory with eld variables i (i = 1, . . . , m) and lagrangian
l(i, i, . . . , 1...k i). the eld equations read

a (local) conserved current j is a vector-density which involves the elds
and their derivatives up to some nite order and which is conserved modulo
the eld equations, i.e., which fullls

or, as one also says equal on-shell. thus, (5.3) is equivalent to

j = ili + ili +    + i1...s1...sli

(5.4)

for some i1...j , j = 0, . . . , s. a conserved current is said to be trivial if it
can be written as

j  s

(5.5)

characteristic cohomology

for some local antisymmetric tensor density s = s. the terminology
does not mean that trivial currents are devoid of physical interest, but rather,
that they are easy to construct and that they are trivially conserved. two
conserved currents are said to be equivalent if they dier by a trivial one.
the characteristic cohomology in degree n  1 is dened to be the quotient
space of equivalence classes of conserved currents. one assigns the degree
n  1 because the equations (5.3) and (5.5) can be rewritten as d  0 and
  d in terms of the (n  1)-form  and (n  2)-form  respectively dual
to j and s.

one denes the characteristic cohomology in degree k (k < n) along
exactly the same lines, by simply considering other values of the form degree.
so, one says that a local k-form  is a cocycle of the characteristic cohomology
in degree k if it is weakly closed,

d  0; cocycle condition

and that it is a coboundary if it is weakly exact,

  d, coboundary condition

(5.6)

(5.7)

just as it is done for k = n  1. for instance, the characteristic cohomology
in form degree n  2 is dened, in dual notations, as the quotient space of
equivalence classes of weakly conserved antisymmetric tensors,

s  0, s = s[],

where two such tensors are regarded as equivalent i

s  s

  r, r = r[].

(5.8)

(5.9)

we shall denote the characteristic cohomological groups by h k

char(d).

higher order conservation laws involving antisymmetric tensors of degree
2 or higher are quite interesting in their own right. in particular, conservation
laws of the form (5.8), involving an antisymmetric tensor s have attracted
a great deal of interest in the past [72] as well as recently [73, 74] in the
context of the charge without charge mechanism developed by wheeler
[75]. higher order conservation laws also enter the analysis of the brst
eld-antield formalism extension incorporating global symmetries [76, 77].
but as we have seen in section (4.3) the characteristic cohomology is also
important because it appears as an important step in the calculation of the
local brst cohomology.

in this section we will carry out the calculation of the characteristic co-
homology for a system of free p-form gauge elds. we give complete results

in degree < n  1; that is, we determine all the solutions to the equation
s1...s  0 with s > 0. although we do not solve the characteristic coho-
mology in degree n  1, we comment at the end of the section on the gauge
invariance properties of the conserved currents and provide an innite num-
ber of them, generalizing earlier results of the maxwell case [78, 79, 80, 81].
the determination of all the conserved currents is of course also an interest-
ing question, but it is not systematically pursued here for two reasons. first,
for the free theories considered here, the characteristic cohomology h n1
char(d)
is innite-dimensional and does not appear to be completely known even in
the maxwell case in an arbitrary number of dimensions. by contrast, the
cohomological groups h k
char(d), k < n  1, are all nite-dimensional and can
explicitly be computed. second, the group h n1
char(d) plays no role either in
the analysis of the consistent interactions of antisymmetric tensor elds of
degree > 1, nor in the analysis of candidate anomalies if the antisymmetric
tensor elds all have degree > 2.

an essential feature of theories involving p-form gauge elds is that their
gauge symmetries are reducible (see (3.6)). general vanishing theorems have
been established in [68, 38, 39, 27] showing that the characteristic cohomology
of reducible theories of reducibility order p1 vanishes in form degree strictly
smaller than n  p  1. accordingly, in the case of p-form gauge theories,
there can be a priori non-vanishing characteristic cohomology only in form
degree n  pm  1, n  pm , etc, up to form degree n  1 (conserved currents).
in the 1-form case, these are the best vanishing theorems one can prove,
since a set of free gauge elds aa
 has characteristic cohomology both in form
degree n  1 and n  2 [27]. representatives of the cohomology classes in
form degree n  2 are given by the duals to the eld strengths, which are
indeed closed on-shell due to maxwell equations.

our main result is that the general vanishing theorems of [68, 38, 39,
69, 70, 27] can be considerably strengthened when p > 1. for instance, if
there is a single p-form gauge eld and if n  p  1 is odd, there is only
one non-vanishing group of the characteristic cohomology in degree < n  1.
this is h np1
char(d)
with n  p  1 < k < n  1 happen to be zero, even though the general
theorems of [68, 38, 39, 69, 70, 27] left open the possibility that they might
not vanish. the presence of these additional zeros give p-form gauge elds
and their gauge transformations a strong rigidity.

besides the standard characteristic cohomology, one may consider the
invariant characteristic cohomology, in which the local forms  and  occur-
ring in (5.6) and (5.7) are required to be invariant under the gauge trans-
formations (3.6). this is the relevant cohomology for the resolution of the
wess-zumino consistency condition. we also completely determine in this

68

characteristic cohomology

section the invariant characteristic cohomology in form degree < n  1.

our method for computing the characteristic cohomology is based on
the reformulation performed in [27] of the characteristic cohomology in form
degree k in terms of the cohomology h n
nk(|d) of the koszul-tate dierential
 modulo the spacetime exterior derivative d. here, n is the form degree and
n  k is the antighost number.

this section is organized as follows. first, since the calculation of the
characteristic cohomology is rather long and intricate, we begin by formu-
lating precisely our main results, which state (i) that the characteristic co-
homology h k
char(d) with k < n  1 is generated (in the exterior product)
dual to the eld strengths h a; these are forms
by the exterior forms h
of degree n  pa  1; and (ii) that the invariant characteristic cohomology
h k,inv
char (d) with k < n  1 is generated (again in the exterior product) by the
exterior forms h a and h
. then, we recall the relation between the charac-
teristic cohomology and the koszul-tate complex and show how they relate
to the cohomology of the dierential  =  + d. after that we analyze the
gauge invariance properties of -boundaries modulo d. we then determine
the characteristic cohomology for a single p-form gauge eld and afterwards
extend the results to an arbitrary system of p-forms. next, we calculate the
invariant cohomology and use the results to obtain the cohomological groups
h ,inv(|d). finally, we show that the existence of representatives express-
ible in terms of the h
s does not hold for the characteristic cohomology in
form degree n  1, by exhibiting an innite number of (inequivalent) con-
served currents which are not of that form. we will also comment on how
the results on the free characteristic cohomology in degree < n  1 generalize
straightforwardly if one adds to the free lagrangian (3.2) gauge invariant
interaction terms that involve the elds ba
and their derivatives only
through the gauge invariant eld strength components and their derivatives.

69

the remarkable feature is that these polynomials are not only inequiva-
lent in cohomology, but also that they completely exhaust the characteristic
cohomology in form degree strictly smaller than n  1. indeed, one has:

theorem 12. let h be the algebra generated by the h
s and let v be the
subspace containing the polynomials in the h
s with no term of form de-
gree exceeding n  2. the subspace v is isomorphic to the characteristic
cohomology in form degree < n  1.

we stress again that this theorem does not hold in degree n  1 because

there exist conserved currents not expressible in terms of the h

s.

since the form degree is limited by the spacetime dimension n, and since
h
has strictly positive form degree n  pa  1 (as explained previously, we
assume n  pa  1 > 0 for each a), the algebra h is nite-dimensional. in this
algebra, the h
with n  pa  1 even commute with all the other generators,
while the h

with n  pa  1 odd are anticommuting objects.

5.2.2

invariant characteristic cohomology

while the cocycles of theorem 12 are all gauge invariant, there exists co-
boundaries of the characteristic cohomology that are gauge invariant, i.e.,
that involve only the eld strength components and their derivatives, but
which cannot, nevertheless, be written as coboundaries of gauge invariant
local forms, even weakly. examples are given by the eld strengths h a = dba
themselves. for this reason, the invariant characteristic cohomology and the
characteristic cohomology do not coincide. we shall denote by h the nite-
dimensional algebra generated by the (pa + 1)-forms h a, and by j the nite-
a
dimensional algebra generated by the eld strengths h a and their duals h
.
one has,

a

theorem 13. let w be the subspace of j containing the polynomials in the
h as and the h
s with no term of form degree exceeding n2. the subspace
w is isomorphic to the invariant characteristic cohomology in form degree
< n  1.

this chapter is devoted to proving these theorems.

5.2.3 cohomologies in the algebra of x-independent

forms

the previous theorems hold as such in the algebra of local forms that are
allowed to have an explicit x-dependence. if one restricts ones attention to

70

characteristic cohomology

the algebra of local forms with no explicit dependence on the spacetime co-
ordinates, then, one must replace in the above theorems the polynomials in
the curvatures and their duals with coecients that are numbers by the poly-
nomials in the curvatures and their duals with coecients that are constant
exterior forms.

5.3 characteristic cohomology and koszul-

tate complex

our analysis of the characteristic cohomology relies upon the isomorphism
established in [27] between h 
 (|d) of  modulo
d. the cohomology h k
i (|d) in form degree k and antighost number i is
obtained by solving in the algebra p of local exterior forms the equation,

char(d) and the cohomology h 

ak

i1 = 0,

(5.11)

and by identifying solutions which dier by -exact and d-exact terms, i.e,

(5.18)

eq. (5.17) shows that an

nk is a cocycle of the cohomology of  mod-
ulo d, in form-degree n and antighost number nk. now, given the co-
homological class  of h k
char(d), it is easy to see, using again theorem
2, that the corresponding element an
nk(|d).
consequently, the above procedure denes an non-ambiguous map m

(5.17) and using the second form of the

number zero, one sees that there exists a cocycle ak
0 of the character-
istic cohomology such that m([ak

0]) = [an

that h n

m(|d) vanishes for m > n is proved as follows. if an

m is a
solution of an
m1 then one can build a descent by acting with
 on this equation. the bottom of this descent satises, anj
mj = 0.
since j  n and m > n, theorem 2 implies that the bottom of the
descent and all the cocycles above him are trivial.

the proof of the theorem also shows that (5.13) holds as such because one
allows for an explicit x-dependence of the local forms. otherwise, one must
take into account the constant forms ck which appear in the analysis of
injectivity and which are no longer exact even when k > 0, so that (5.13)

while (5.14) and (5.15) remain unchanged.

5.4 characteristic cohomology and cohomo-

logy of  =  + d

we have seen in section 3.4 that in form notation, the action on the antields
of the koszul-tate dierential can be written in the compact form,

the parity of the mixed form h a is equal to n  pa  1. quite generally,
to the eld strength h a is the term of

namely, zero. at the other end, the term of highest form degree in h a is

degree, all the terms present in the expansion of h a have same -degree,
namely n  pa  1.

the dierential  =  + d enables one to reformulate the characteristic

cohomology as the cohomology of . indeed one has,

theorem 15. the cohomology of  is isomorphic to the characteristic co-
homology,

h k()  h k

char(d), 0  k  n

(5.23)

where k in h k() means the -degree, and in h k

char(d) k is the form degree.

5.4 characteristic cohomology and cohomology of  =  + d

73

proof:

let ak

0 (k < n) be a cocycle of the characteristic cohomology. con-
struct ak as in the proof of theorem 14, formula (5.18). the form ak
is easily seen to be a cocycle of , ak = 0, and furthermore, to be
uniquely dened in cohomology given the class of ak
0. it is also imme-
diate to check that the map so dened is both injective and surjective.
this proves the theorem for k < n. for k = n, the isomorphism of
h n() and h n
0 = 0 is equivalent to
0 = 0 and an
an

char(d) is even more direct (dan
0 = dbn1

1 is equivalent to an

0 + bn

0 = (bn1

0 + bn

1 )).

our discussion has also established the following useful rule: the term of low-
est form degree in a -cocycle a is a cocycle of the characteristic cohomology.
its form degree is equal to the -degree k of a. for a = h a, this reproduce
the rule discussed above theorem 15. similarly, the term of highest form
degree in a has always form degree equal to n if a is not a -coboundary (up
to a constant), and denes an element of h n

nk(|d).

because  is a derivation, its cocycles form an algebra. therefore, any
polynomial in the h a is also a -cocycle. since the form degree is limited
by the spacetime dimension n, and since the term h
with minimum form
degree in h a has strictly positive form degree npa1, the algebra generated
by the h a is nite-dimensional. we shall show below that these -cocycles
are not exact and that any cocycle of form degree < n  1 is a polynomial
in the h a modulo trivial terms. according to the isomorphism expressed by
theorem 15, this is equivalent to proving theorem 12.

remarks:
only two terms,

(i) the -cocycle associated with a conserved current contains

a = an

1 + an1

0

,

(5.24)

0

where an1
is the dual of the conserved current. the product of such a -
cocycle with a -cocycle of -degree k has -degree n  1 + k and therefore
vanishes unless k = 0 or 1.
(ii) it will be useful below to introduce another degree n as follows. one
assigns n-degree 0 to the undierentiated elds and n-degree 1 to all the
antields irrespective of their antighost number. one then extends the n-
degree to the dierentiated variables according to the rule n() = n()+
1. thus, n counts the number of derivatives and of antields. explicitly,

dent components of ba; and (iv) the sum over  is a sum over the independent
components of all the antields appearing in the tower associated with ba
(but there is no sum over the p-form species a in (5.26)). the dierential
 increases n by one unit. the dierentials d and  have in addition an
inhomogeneous piece not changing the n-degree, namely dx(explicit/x),
where explicit/x sees only the explicit x-dependence. the forms h a have
n-degree equal to one.

5.5 acyclicity and gauge invariance

5.5.1 preliminary results

in the sequel, we shall denote by ismall the algebra of local exterior forms
with coecients 1...j that depend only on the eld strength components
and their derivatives (and possibly x); these are the only invariant objects
that can be formed out of the potentials ba
and their derivatives (c.f.
theorem 3). the algebras h, h and j respectively generated by the (pa+1)-
forms h a, (n  pa  1)-forms h
) are subalgebras of ismall.
remember that we have also dened the algebra i as the algebra of invariant
polynomials in the eld strength components, the antield components and
their derivatives and that in pureghost number 0 the cohomology h() is
given by i.

and (h a, h

1...pa

since the eld equations are gauge invariant and since d maps ismall on
ismall, one can consider the cohomological problem (5.6), (5.7) in the algebra
ismall. this denes the invariant characteristic cohomology h ,inv
char (d). fur-
thermore, the dierentials , d and  map the algebra i on itself. clearly,
ismall  i. the invariant cohomologies h ,inv() and h n,inv
(|d) are dened
j
by considering only local exterior forms that belong to i.

in order to analyze the invariant characteristic cohomology and to prove
the non triviality of the cocycles listed in theorem 12, we shall need some
preliminary results on the invariant cohomology of the koszul-tate dieren-
tial  and on the gauge invariant -boundaries modulo d.

we dene a and a respectively as the restrictions of p and p in

pureghost number 0.

the variables generating a are, together with x and dx,

ba1...pa , ba1...pa , . . . , ba1...pam, ba1...pam, . . . , ba, ba, ... .

5.5 acyclicity and gauge invariance

75

these variables can be conveniently split into two subsets. the rst subset
consists of the variables  dened below theorem 3 (eld strengths, antields
and their derivatives). note that the eld strengths and their derivatives
which are present in  are not independent, since they are constrained by the
identity dh a = 0 and its dierential consequences, but this is not a diculty
for the considerations of this section. the s are invariant under the gauge
transformations and they generate the algebra i of invariant polynomials.
in order to generate the full algebra a we need to add to the s some
extra variables that will be collectively denoted . the s contain the eld
components ba1...pa and their appropriate derivatives not already present
in the s. the explicit form of the s may be found in the proof of theorem
3 and have the property that they are algebraically independent from the s
and that, together with the s, they generate a.

theorem 16. let a be a polynomial in the : a = a(). if a = b then we
can choose b such that b = b(). in particular,

h inv

j

()  0 for j > 0.

(5.27)

proof: we can decompose b into two parts: b = b + b, with b = b() =

b( = 0) and b = pm rm()sm(), where sm() contains at least
one . because  = 0, we have, (b+b) = b()+pm rm()sm().

furthermore if m = m() then m() = (m)(). we thus get,

a() = (b)() +xm

(rm)()sm().

the above equation has to be satised for all the values of the s and
in particular for  = 0. this means that a() = (b)() = b().

all have the same degree p. this covers, in particular, the case of a single

acts with d on one of the equations and uses theorem 16 and the fact
that d maps a  on a . to go down the ladder one acts with  on one
of the equations and uses theorem 6 and the fact that  also maps a
 on a .

using the same theorems, it is easy to see that if one of the i
j
may be assumed to depend only on the , then one can suppose that
it is also true for the other i
j. therefore, the theorem will hold if
we can prove it for the equation at the top of the ladder and thus for

(5.31)

all we need to prove is that one can assume that bq+1 only depends
on the . to this end, let us take the euler-lagrange derivatives of
(5.31) with respect to all the elds and the antields. using theorem

all the ya1...pm may be assumed to depend only on the . fur-
thermore, since aq depends on ba1...p only through h a1...p+1, its
euler-lagrange derivatives with respect to ba1...p are of the form
za1...p where za1...p only depends on h a1...p+1 and is com-
pletely antisymmetric. this implies that we may also assume that
xa1...p only depends on the .

eq. (5.35) means that xa1...p is dual to an element of h np

the theorem will thus be proven if the recurrence hypothesis is

for q > n and therefore for q  = q + r(p + 1) for a suciently great

remark : the theorem does not hold if the forms have various form degrees
(see theorem 25 below).

5.6 characteristic cohomology for a single

p-form gauge field

our strategy for computing the characteristic cohomology is as follows. first,
we compute h n
 (|d) (cocycle condition, coboundary condition) for a single
p-form. we then use the isomorphism theorems to infer h 
char(d). finally,
we solve the case of a system involving an arbitrary (but nite) number of
p-forms of various form degrees.

5.6.1 general theorems

before we compute h n
 (|d) for a single abelian p-form gauge eld b1...p,
we will recall some general results which will be needed in the sequel. these

5.6 characteristic cohomology for a single p-form gauge field79

theorems hold for an arbitrary linear theory of reducibility order p  1.

theorem 18. for a linear gauge theory of reducibility order p-1, one has,

h n

j (|d) = 0,

j > p + 1.

(5.40)

proof: the technic of the proof is the same as the one used in the previous
theorem. although it is valid for any linear theory [27] we only prove it
for free p-forms. suppose there exists some a with antighost(a) > p+1,
satisfying,

a + b = 0.

equation (5.49) shows explicitly that a is trivial.

theorem 18 is particularly useful because it limits the number of possible
non-vanishing cohomologies. the calculation of the characteristic cohomol-
ogy is further simplied by the following theorem:

theorem 19. any solution of a + b = 0 that is at least bilinear in the
antields is necessarily trivial.

proof:

the proof proceed along the same lines of theorem 18. one takes
the euler-lagrange derivatives of the equation a + b = 0 with
respect to all the elds and antields keeping in mind that since a is
at least bilinear in the antields it cannot depend on b. one then
uses the reconstruction formula (5.49) but with f = 0.

both theorems hold whether the local forms are assumed to have an explicit
x-dependence or not.

5.6.2 cocycles of h n

p+1(|d)

we have just seen that the rst possible non-vanishing cohomological group
is h n
p+1(|d). we show in this section that this group is one-dimensional and
provide explicit representatives. we systematically use the dual notation
involving divergences of antisymmetric tensor densities.

theorem 20. h n
p+1(|d) is one-dimensional. one can take as representa-
tives of the cohomological classes a = kb where b is the last antield, of
antighost number p + 1 and where k is a number.

proof: any polynomial of antighost number p + 1 can be written a =
f b + f b + . . . + , where f does not involve the antields and
where  is at least bilinear in the antields. by adding a divergence

5.6 characteristic cohomology for a single p-form gauge field81

to a, one can remove the derivatives of b, i.e., one can assume f  =
f  =    = 0. the cocycle condition a + b = 0 then implies
f b +  + (b + f b) = 0. by taking the euler-lagrange
derivative of this equation with respect to b, one gets

f + ((1)p l

b ) = 0.

(5.50)

this shows that f is a cocycle of the characteristic cohomology in de-
gree zero since (anything of antighost number one)  0. furthermore,
if f is trivial in h 0
char(d), then a can be redened so as to be at least
bilinear in the antields and thus is also trivial in the cohomology of 
modulo d. now, the isomorphism of h 0
n (|d) implies
f = k + g with k a constant (h n
n (|d) = 0 because n > p + 1). as
we already pointed out, the second term can be removed by adding a
trivial term, so we may assume f = k. writing a = kb + , we see
that  has to be a solution of  + b = 0 by itself and is therefore
trivial by theorem 19. so h n
p+1(|d) can indeed be represented by

a = kb. in form notations, this is just the n-form kb
p+1. note that
the calculations are true both in the x-dependent and x-independent
cases.

char(d)/r with h n

to complete the proof of the theorem, it remains to show that the
cocycles a = kb, which belong to the invariant algebra i and which
contain the undierentiated antields, are non trivial.
if they were

p+1 = u + dv
trivial, one would have according to theorem 17, that b
for some u, v also in i. but this is impossible, because both  and d

bring in one derivative of the invariant generators  while b
p+1 does
not contain derivatives of .
[this derivative counting argument is
direct if u and v do not involve explicitly the spacetime coordinates

x. if they do, one must expand u, v and the equation b
p+1 = u + dv
according to the number of derivatives of the elds in order to reach
the conclusion. explicitly, one sets u = u0 +    + uk, v = v0 +    + vk,
where k counts the number of derivatives of the h1...p+1 and of the

antields. the condition b
p+1 = u + dv implies in degree k + 1 in
the derivatives that uk + dvk = 0, where d does not dierentiate
with respect to the explicit dependence on x. this relation implies
in turn that uk is -trivial modulo d since there is no cohomology in
antighost number p + 2. thus, one can remove uk by adding trivial
terms. repeating the argument for uk1, and then for uk2 etc, leads
to the desired conclusion].

82

characteristic cohomology

5.6.3 cocycles of h n

i (|d) with i  p

we now solve the cocycle condition for the remaining degrees. first we prove

theorem 21. let k be the greatest integer such that n  k(n  p  1) > 1.
the cohomological groups h n
j (|d) (j > 1) vanish unless j = n  k(n  p  1),
k = 1, 2, . . . , k. furthermore, for those values of j, h n
j (|d) is at most one-
dimensional.

proof: we already know that h n

j (|d) is zero for j > p + 1 and that
h n
p+1(|d) is one-dimensional. assume thus that the theorem has been
proved for all js strictly greater than j < p + 1 and let us extend it
to j. in a manner analogous to what we did in the proof of theorem
20, we can assume that the cocycles of h n

j (|d) take the form,

f1...p+1j b1...p+1j + ,

(5.51)

char

where f1...p+1j does not involve the antields and denes an ele-
ment of h p+1j
(d). furthermore, if f1...p+1j is trivial, then the co-
cycle (5.51) is also trivial. now, using the isomorphism h p+1j
(d) 
np1+j(|d) (p + 1  j > 0), we see that f is trivial unless j =
h n
n  p  1 + j, which is strictly greater than j and is of the form
j = n  k(n  p  1). in this case, h n
j  is at most one-dimensional.
since j = j  (n  p  1) = n  (k + 1)(n  p  1) is of the required
form, the property extends to j. this proves the theorem.

char

because we explicitly used the isomorphism h p+1j
np1+j(|d),
which holds only if the local forms are allowed to involve explicitly the co-
ordinates x, the theorem must be amended for x-independent local forms.
this will be done in section (5.6.5).

(d)  h n

char

theorem 21 goes beyond the vanishing theorems of [68, 38, 39, 27] since it
sets further cohomological groups equal to zero, in antighost number smaller
than p + 1. this is done by viewing the cohomological group h n
i (|d) as a
subset of h n
np1+i(|d) at a higher value of the antighost number, through
the form (5.51) of the cocycle and the isomorphism between h p+1i
char (d) and
h n
np1+i(|d). in that manner, the known zeros at values of the ghost num-
ber greater than p + 1 are propagated down to values of the ghost number
smaller than p + 1.

to proceed with the analysis, we have to consider two cases:

(i) case i: n  p  1 is even.
(ii) case ii: n  p  1 is odd.

5.6 characteristic cohomology for a single p-form gauge field83

we start with the simplest case, namely, case i. here, h is a commuting
object and we can consider its various powers ( h)k, k = 1, 2, . . . , k with k
as in theorem 21. these powers have -degree k(n  p  1). by theorem
15, the term of form degree n in ( h)k denes a cocycle of h n
nk(np1)(|d),
which is non trivial as is indicated by the same invariance argument used in
the previous subsection. thus, h n
nk(np1)(|d), which we know is at most
one-dimensional, is actually exactly one-dimensional and one may take as
representative the term of form degree n in ( h)k. this settles the case when
n  p  1 is even.

n2(np1)(|d) = h n

in the case when n  p  1 is odd, h is an anticommuting object and
its powers ( h)k, k > 0 all vanish unless k = 1. we want to show that
h n
nk(np1)(|d) similarly vanishes unless k = 1. to that end, it is enough to
prove that h n
2p+2n(|d) = 0 as the proof of theorem 21
indicates (we assume, as before, that 2p + 2  n > 1 since we only investigate
here the cohomological groups h n
i (|d) with i > 1). now, as we have seen,
the most general cocycle in h n
2p+2n(|d) may be assumed to take the form
a = fp+2...nbp+2...n + , where  is at least quadratic in the antields
and where fp+2...n does not involve the antields and denes an element
of h np1
p+1(|d) is one-dimensional and one may
take as representative of h np1
(d) the dual k1...nh 1...p+1 of the eld
strength. this means that a is necessarily of the form,

(d)  h n

char

char

(d). but h np1

char

a = k1...nh 1...p+1bp+2...n + ,

(5.52)

so the question to be answered is: for which value of k can one adjust  in
(5.52) so that,

k1...nh 1...p+1bp+2...n +  + b = 0 ?

(5.53)

in (5.53),  does not contain bp+2...n and is at least quadratic in the anti-
elds. without loss of generality, we can assume that it is exactly quadratic in
the antields and that it does not contain derivatives, since  and  are both
linear and bring in one derivative. [that  can be assumed to be quadratic
is obvious. that it can also be assumed not to contain the derivatives of the
antields is a little bit less obvious since we allow for explicit x-dependence,
but can be easily checked by expanding  and b according to the number
of derivatives of the variables and using the triviality of the cohomology of 
modulo d in the space of local forms that are at least quadratic in the elds
and the antields]. thus we can write,

 = 1...nb1...p

(1)

bp+1...n

(2p+1n) + ,

84

characteristic cohomology

(2p+2n) nor bp+1...n

where  neither involves bp+2...n
(2p+1n) . we have explicitly indi-
cated the antighost number in parentheses in order to keep track of it. insert-
ing this form of  in (5.53) one nds by taking the euler-lagrange derivatives
of the result by bp+1...n
(2p+1n) that 1...n is equal to k1...n if 2p + 1  n > 1
(if 2p + 1  n = 1, see below). one can then successively eliminate bp...n
(2pn) ,
bp1...n

(2pn1) etc from .

so the question ultimately boils down to: is

k1...2j b1...j

(p+1j)bj+1...2j

(p+1j)

for n even = 2j

or

k1...2j+1b1...j+1

(pj)

bj+2...2j+1

(p+1j)

for n odd = 2j + 1

-exact modulo d, i.e., of the form  + c, where  does not involve the
antields b

s for s > p + 1  j (n even) or s > p  j (n odd)?

that the answer to this question is negative unless k = 0 and accordingly
that a is trivial, is easily seen by trying to construct explicitly . we treat
for deniteness the case n even (n = 2j).

one has

 = 1...2j b1...j

(p+1j)bj+1...2j

(p+1j)

where 1...2j
is antisymmetric (respectively symmetric) for the exchange
of (1 . . . j) with (j+1 . . . 2j) if j is even (respectively odd) (the j-form

(p+1j) is odd by assumption and this can happen only if the components
b
b1...j
(p+1j) are odd for j even, or even for j odd). from the equation

k1...2j b1...j

(p+1j)bj+1...2j

(p+1j) =  + c

one gets

k1...2j b1...j

(p+1j)bj+1...2j

(pj)

= 21...2j b1...j

(p+1j)bj+1...2j

(pj)

(5.54)

+ c

(5.55)

taking the euler-lagrange derivative of this equation with respect to b1...j
(p+1j)
yields next

= 0,

(cid:0)k1...2j  21...2j(cid:1)bj+1...2j

(pj)

which implies k1...2j = 21...2j . this contradicts the symmetry proper-
ties of 1...2j , unless k = 0, as we wanted to prove.

i (|d) with i > 1 is h n

p+1(|d) with representatives kb

by means of the isomorphism theorems 14 and 15, our results on h n
can be translated in terms of the characteristic cohomology as follows.
(i) if n  p  1 is odd, the only non-vanishing group of the characteristic
cohomology in form degree < n  1 is h np1
(d), which is one-dimensional.
all the other groups vanish. one may take as representatives for h np1
(d)
the cocycles kh. similarly, the only non-vanishing group h j() with j <
n1 is h np1() with representatives k h and the only non-vanishing group
h n
(ii) if n  p  1 is even, there is further cohomology. the degrees in which
there is non trivial cohomology are multiples of n  p  1 (considering again
values of the form degree strictly smaller than n  1). thus, there is charac-
teristic cohomology only in degrees n  p  1, 2(n  p  1), 3(n  p  1) etc.
the corresponding groups are one-dimensional and one may take as repre-
sentatives kh, k(h)2, k(h)3 etc. there is also non-vanishing -cohomology
for the same values of the -degree, with representative cocycles given by
k h, k( h)2, k( h)3, etc. by expanding these cocycles according to the form
degree and keeping the terms of form degree n, one gets representatives for
the only non-vanishing groups h n

an immediate consequence of our analysis is the following useful theorem:

theorem 22. if the polynomial p k(h) of form degree k < n in the cur-
vature (p + 1)-form h is -exact modulo d in the invariant algebra i, then
p k(h) = 0.

proof: the theorem is straightforward in the algebra of x-independent
local forms;
it follows from a direct derivative counting argument.
to prove it when an explicit x-dependence is allowed, one proceeds
as follows.

5.6.5 characteristic cohomology in the algebra of x-

independent local forms

let us denote ( h)m by pm (m = 0, . . . , k). we have just shown (i) that the
most general cocycles of the -cohomology are given, up to trivial terms, by
the linear combinations mpm with m real or complex numbers; and (ii) that
if mpm is -exact, then the m are all zero. in establishing these results, we
allowed for an explicit x-dependence of the local forms (see comments after
the proof of theorem 21). how are our results aected if we work exclusively
with local forms with no explicit x-dependence?

char

(d)  h n

in the above analysis, it is in calculating the cocycles that arise in anti-
ghost number < p + 1 that we used the x-dependence of the local forms,
through the isomorphism h p+1j
np1+j(|d). if the local exterior
forms are not allowed to depend explicitly on x, one must take into account
the constant k-forms (k > 0). the derivation goes otherwise unchanged and
one nds that the cohomology of  in the space of x-independent local forms
is given by the polynomials in the pm with coecients m that are constant
forms, m = m(dx). in addition, if mpm is -exact, then, mpm = 0 for
each m. one cannot infer from this equation that m vanishes, because it
is an exterior form. one can simply assert that the components of m of
form degree n  m(n  p  1) or lower are zero (when multiplied by pm, the
other components of m yields forms of degree > n that identically vanish,
no matter what these other components are).

it will be also useful in the sequel to know the cohomology of , where
 is the part of  that acts only on the elds and antields, and not on the
explicit x-dependence. one has  =  + dx, where dx  explicit/x sees
only the explicit x-dependence. by the above result, the cohomology of 
is clearly given by the polynomials in the pm with coecients m that are
now arbitrary spacetime forms, m = m(x, dx).

5.7 characteristic cohomology in the gen-

eral case

to compute the cohomology h n
i (|d) for an arbitrary set of p-forms, one pro-
ceeds along the lines of the kunneth theorem. let us illustrate explicitly the
procedure for two elds b1
. one may split the dierential
 as a sum of terms with denite na-degrees,

and b2

1...p1

1...p2

 = 1 + 2 + dx

(5.56)

5.7 characteristic cohomology in the general case

87

(see (5.26)). in (5.56), dx leaves both n1 and n2 unchanged. by contrast, 1
increases n1 by one unit without changing n2, while 2 increases n2 by one
unit without changing n1. the dierential 1 acts only on the elds b1 and
its associated antields (elds and antields of the rst set), whereas the
dierential 2 acts only on the elds b2 and its associated antields (elds
and antields of the second set). note that 1 + 2 = .

let a be a cocycle of  with -degree < n  1. expand a according to

the n1-degree,

a = a0 + a1 + a2 +    + am, n1(aj) = j.

(5.57)

the equation a = 0 implies 1am = 0 for the term am of highest n1-degree.
our analysis of the -cohomology for a single p-form then yields am =
cm( h 1)k + 1(something), where cm involves only the elds and antields of
the second set, as well as dx and possibly x. there can be no conserved
current in am since we assume the -degree of a - and thus of each aj - to
be strictly smaller than n  1. now, the exact term in am can be absorbed
by adding to am a -exact term, through a redenition of am1. once this
is done, one nds that the next equation for am and am1 following from
a = 0 reads

[(2 + dx)cm]( h 1)k + 1am1 = 0.

(5.58)

but we have seen that m( h 1)k cannot be exact unless it is zero, and thus
this last equation implies both

and

[(2 + dx)cm]( h 1)k = 0

1am1 = 0.

(5.59)

(5.60)

since ( h 1)k has independent form components in degrees k(n  p  1), k(n 
p  1) + 1 up to degree n, we infer from (5.59) that the form components of
(2 + dx)cm of degrees 0 up to degree n  k(n  p  1) are zero. if we expand
m, we obtain the equations

cm itself according to the form degree, cm =p ci

m = 0, i = 1, . . . , n  k(n  p  1),

ci

m + dci1

and

c0

m = 0.

88

characteristic cohomology

our analysis of the relationship between the -cohomology and the coho-
mology of  modulo d indicates then that one can redene the terms of form
degree > n  k(n  p  1) of cm in such a way that cm = 0. this does
not aect the product cm( h 1)k. we shall assume that the (irrelevant) higher
order terms in cm have been chosen in that manner. with that choice, cm
is given, up to trivial terms that can be reabsorbed, by m( h 2)l, with m a
number (or a constant form in the case of p), so that am = m( h 2)l( h 1)k
is a -cocycle by itself. one next successively repeats the analysis for am1,
am2 until one reaches the desired conclusion that a may indeed be assumed
to be a polynomial in the h as, as claimed above.

the non-triviality of the polynomials in the h as is also easy to prove. if
p ( h) = , with  = 0 + 1 +    + m, n1(k) = k, then one gets at n1-
degree m+1 the condition (p ( h))m+1 = 1m, which implies (p ( h))m+1 = 0
and 1m = 0, since no polynomial in h 1 is 1-trivial, except zero.
it
follows that m = u( h 1)m up to trivial terms that play no role, where u is
a function of the variables of the second set as well as of x and dx. the

the non-triviality of the polynomials in h 1 in 1-cohomology yields next

equation of order m implies then (p ( h))m =(cid:0)(2 + dx)u(cid:1)( h 1)m + 1m1.
1m1 = 0 and (p ( h))m = (cid:0)(2 + dx)u(cid:1)( h 1)m. since the coecient of

( h 1)m in (p ( h))m is a polynomial in h 2, which cannot be (2 + dx)-exact,
one gets in fact (p ( h))m = 0 and (2 + dx)u = 0. it follows that m fullls
m = 0 and can be dropped. the analysis goes on in the same way at the
lower values of the 1-degree, until one reaches the desired conclusion that
the exact polynomial p ( h) indeed vanishes.

in view of the isomorphism between the characteristic cohomology and
h (), this completes the proof of theorem 12 in the case of two p-forms.
the case of more p-forms is treated similarly.

first, we establish isomorphism theorems between h k,inv

extend the calculation to an arbitrary systems of p-forms.

introduced in the demonstration of theorem 14 associates h k,inv
char (d)
and h n,inv
nk (|d). indeed, in the expansion (5.18) for a, all the terms can
be assumed to be invariant on account of theorem 16. the surjectivity
of m is also direct, provided that the polynomials in the curvature
p (h) are not trivial in h (|d), which is certainly the case if there
is a single p-form (theorem 22). we shall thus use theorem 23 rst
only in the case of a single p-form. we shall then prove that theorem
22 extends to an arbitrary system of forms of various form degrees, so
that the proof of theorem 23 will be completed.

nk is trivial in h n,inv

to compute the kernel of m, consider an element ak

0  i such that
the corresponding an
nk (|d). then, again as in the
proof of theorem 14, one nds that all the terms in the expansion
(5.18) are trivial, except perhaps ak
1 = 0,
where bk
1  i is the k-form appearing in the equation expressing the
triviality of ak+1
1) = 0, and
thus, by theorem 6, ak
0  i.
this proves (5.63), since p is not trivial in h (|d) (theorem 22).
[again, we are entitled to use this fact only for a single p-form until
we have proved the non-triviality of p in the general case].

the proof of (5.64) is a direct consequence of theorem 16 and
parallels step by step the proof of a similar statement demonstrated
for 1-forms in [28] (lemma 6.1). it will not be repeated here. finally,
the proof of theorem 24 amounts to observing that the map m that
sends [ak
0] on [a] (equation (5.18)) is indeed well dened in cohomology,
and is injective as well as surjective (independently of whether p (h)
is trivial in the invariant cohomology of  modulo d).

theorem 17 enables one to compute also the invariant characteristic coho-
mology for a single p-form gauge eld.
indeed, this theorem implies that
h n,inv
nk(|d)
are invariant and the coboundary conditions are equivalent. the isomor-
phism of theorem 23 shows then that the invariant characteristic cohomol-
ogy for a single p-form gauge eld in form degree < n  1 is isomorphic to
the subspace of form degree < n  1 of the direct sum h  h. since the
product h h has form degree n, which exceeds n1, this is the same as the
subspace w of theorem 13. the invariant characteristic cohomology in form
degree k < n  1 is thus given by (h  h)k, i.e., by the invariant polynomials
in the curvature h and its dual h with form degree < n  1. similarly, by
the isomorphism of theorem 24, the invariant cohomology h k,inv() of  is
given by the polynomials in h and h with -degree smaller than n  1.

5.8.3

invariant cohomology of  in the general case

the invariant -cohomology for an arbitrary system of p-form gauge elds
follows again from a straightforward application of the kunneth formula
and is thus given by the polynomials in the h as and h as with -degree
smaller than n  1. the explicit proof of this statement works as in the
non-invariant case (for that matter, it is actually more convenient to use as
degrees not n1 and n2, but rather, degrees counting the number of derivatives
of the invariant variables s. these degrees have the advantage that the
cohomology is entirely in degree zero). in particular, none of the polynomials
in the h as and h as is trivial.

the isomorphism of theorem 24 implies next that the invariant charac-
teristic cohomology h k,inv
char (d) (k < n  1) is given by the polynomials in the
curvatures h a and their duals h
, restricted to form degree smaller than
n  1. among these, those that involve the curvatures h a are weakly ex-
act, but not invariantly so. the property of theorem 22 thus extends as
announced to an arbitrary system of dynamical gauge forms of various form
degrees.

because the forms have now dierent form degrees, one may have elements
char (d) (k < n  1) that involve both the curvatures and their duals.

5.9 invariant cohomology of  mod d

the easiest way to work out explicitly h n,inv
nk (|d) in the general case is to
use the above isomorphism theorems, which we are now entitled to do. thus,
one starts from h k,inv() and one works out the component of form degree
n in the associated cocycles.

nk(|d) coincide can no longer hold.

because one has elements in h k,inv() that involve simultaneously both
the curvatures and their -invariant duals h a, the property that h n,inv
nk (|d)
and h n
in the previous example, one
would nd that h (1)
b(2) , which has antighost number two, is a -cocycle
modulo d, but it cannot be written invariantly so. an important case where
the isomorphism h n,inv
nk(|d) (k > 1) does hold, however, is
when the forms have all the same degrees.

nk (|d)  h n

to write down the generalization of theorem 17 in the case of p-forms of
dierent degrees, let p (h a, h a) be a polynomial in the curvatures (pa + 1)-
forms h a and their -invariant duals h a. one has p = 0. we shall be
interested in polynomials of -degree < n that are of degree > 0 in both
h a and h a. the condition that p be of degree > 0 in h a implies that it is
trivial (but not invariantly so), while the condition that it be of degree > 0
in h a guarantees that when expanded according to the antighost number, p
has non-vanishing components of antighost number > 0,

p =

(5.67)

from p = 0, one has [p ]n

there is no polynomial in h a and h a with the required properties if all
the antisymmetric tensors ba
have the same form degree (pa = p for
all as) since the product h a h b has necessarily -degree n. when there are
tensors of dierent form degrees, one can construct, however, polynomials p
with the given features.

magnetism. they are symmetric for the exchange of  and  and are duality
invariant in the critical dimension n = 2p + 2 where the eld strength and
its dual have same form degree p + 1. in this critical dimension, there are

b1...p = m 1...m + n 1...m,

(5.75)

for some m 1...m and n 1...m? without loss of generality, one can assume
that m and n have the lorentz transformation properties indicated by their
indices type (the parts of m and n transforming in other representations
would cancel by themselves). we can also decompose both sides of eq.
(5.75) according to tensors of given symmetry type (under the permutations
of 1 . . . m); in particular (5.75) implies:

h (

1...p

,1...m)

b1...p = m (1...m) + n (1...m).

(5.76)

moreover, according to theorem 17, one can also assume that m and
n are gauge invariant, i.e., belong to i. if one takes into account all the
symmetries of the left-hand side and use the identity dh = 0, eq. (5.76)
reduces to,

h (

1...p

,1...m)

b1...p = n ( 1...m) + terms that vanish on-shell.

(5.77)

this is a consequence of the fact that there is no suitable polynomial in
()h1...r and ()b

1...s which can be present in m (1...m).

if one takes the euler-lagrange derivative of this equation with respect

to b1...p one gets,

which is not the case.

h(|1...p|,1...m)  0,

(5.78)

characteristic cohomology

this shows that t 1...m (with m even) is not trivial in the algebra of
x-independent local forms. it then follows, by a mere counting of derivative
argument, that the t 1...m dene independent cohomological classes and
cannot be expressed as polynomials in the undierentiated dual to the eld
strengths h with coecients that are constant forms.

a

the fact that the conserved currents are not always expressible in terms
of the forms h
makes the validity of this property for higher order conser-
vation laws more striking. in that respect, it should be indicated that the
computation of the characteristic cohomology in the algebra generated by
the h
is clearly a trivial question. the non trivial issue is to demonstrate
that this computation does not miss other cohomological classes in degree
k < n  1.

a

finally, we point out that the conserved currents can all be redened so
as to be strictly gauge-invariant, apart from a few of them whose complete
list can be systematically determined for each given system of p-forms. this
point will be fully established in section 6.3; it extends to higher degree
antisymmetric tensors a property established in [26] for one-forms (see also
[82] in this context).

5.11 introduction of gauge invariant inter-

actions

the analysis of the characteristic cohomology proceeds in the same fashion
if one adds to the lagrangian (3.2) interactions that involve gauge invariant
terms of higher dimensionality. these interactions may increase the deriva-
tive order of the eld equations. the resulting theories should be regarded
as eective theories and can be handled through a systematic perturbation
expansion [83].

the new equations of motion read,

la12...pa = 0,

(5.79)

where la12...pa are the euler-lagrange derivatives of the lagrangian with
respect to the eld strengths (by gauge invariance, l involves only the eld
strength components and their derivatives). these equations can be rewritten
as,

a

dl

 0,

(5.80)

a
where l

is the (n  pa  1)-form dual to the euler-lagrange derivatives.

5.12 summary of results and conclusions

95

the euler-lagrange equations obey the same noether identities as in the
a
free case, so that the koszul-tate dierential takes the same form, with h
everywhere replaced by l

. it then follows that

this implies, in turn, that any polynomial in the la is -closed. it is also
clear that any polynomial in the l
is weakly d-closed. by making the reg-
ularity assumptions on the higher order terms in the lagrangian explained
in [27], one easily veries that these are the only cocycles in form degree
< n  1, and that they are non-trivial. the characteristic cohomology of
the free theory possesses therefore some amount of robustness since it sur-
vives deformations. by contrast, the innite number of non-trivial conserved
currents is not expected to survive interactions (even gauge-invariant ones).
[in certain dimensions, one may add chern-simons terms to the la-
grangian. these interactions are not strictly gauge invariant, but only gauge-
invariant up to a surface term. the equations of motion still take the form
d(something)  0, but now, that something is not gauge invariant. ac-
cordingly, with such interactions, some of the cocycles of the characteristic
cohomology are no longer gauge invariant. these cocycles are removed from
the invariant cohomology].

5.12 summary of results and conclusions

in this section, we have completely worked out the characteristic cohomol-
ogy h k
char(d) in form degree k < n  1 for an arbitrary collection of free,
antisymmetric tensor theories. we have shown in particular that the coho-
mological groups h k
char(d) are nite-dimensional and take a simple form, in
sharp contrast with h n1
char(d), which is innite-dimensional and appears to
be quite complex. thus, even in free eld theories with an innite number
of conserved local currents, the existence of higher degree local conservation
laws is quite constrained. for instance, in ten dimensions, there is one and
only one (non trivial) higher degree conservation law for a single 2-, 3-, 4-,
6-, or 8-form gauge eld, in respective form degrees 7, 6, 5, 3 and 1. it is
dh  0. for a 5-form, there are two higher degree conservation laws, namely
dh  0 and d(h)2  0, in form degrees 4 and 8. for a 7-form, there are four

96

characteristic cohomology

higher degree conservation laws, namely dh  0, d(h)2  0, d(h)3  0 and
d(h)4  0, in form degrees 2, 4, 6 and 8.

our results provide at the same time the complete list of the isomorphic
groups h k(), as well as of h n
nk(|d). we have also worked out the invariant
characteristic cohomology, which is central in the investigation of the brst
cohomology since it controls the antield dependence of brst cohomological
classes.

an interesting feature of the characteristic cohomology in form degree
< n  1 is its robustness to the introduction of strictly gauge invariant
interactions, in contrast to the conserved currents.

chapter 6

free theory: brst cohomology
(part ii)

6.1 main theorems

having studied the characteristic cohomology, we can return to our analysis of
the antield dependent solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition.
in section 4.3.1 we have shown that the most general form for the component
of highest antighost number of a brst cocycle is, an
g,q = pj j where pj is an
element of the invariant characteristic cohomology. according to the results
of the previous section and in particular theorem 25, we are able to specify
further an

g,q. these terms fall into two categories:

1. if q = 1 we have,

g,q=1 = ka1...ar aqa1...ar
an
0,g+1 ,

(6.1)

where the a form a complete set of non-trivial gauge invariant global
symmetries [27] of the action (3.2); they satisfy, a + j
 = 0, where
the j
 form a complete set of non-trivial conserved currents [27]. these
belong to an innite dimensional space and are not all known explicitly.
in the previous section we have exhibited an innite number of them.

2. if q  2 we have,

an
g,q = [pj]n

qj
= [pa1...am]n

qqa1...am
0,g+q ,

(6.2)

(6.3)

where pa1...am is a polynomial in the variables h a and h a and thus
[pa1...am]n

q is a representative of the cohomology h inv(|d).

98

free theory: brst cohomology (part ii)

these results clearly exhibits the fact that the existence of antield depen-
dent solutions is closely tied to the presence of a non-vanishing invariant
characteristic cohomology. furthermore, the component of form degree n of
pa1...am is necessarily of antighost number q  pm + 1. this means that the
expansion of an
g according to the antighost number cannot stop after degree
pm + 1.

to nd elements of the brst cohomology we must try to complete the
g,q with components of lower antighost number in order to have

possible an

g+1 = 0.

(6.4)

where a + dj = 0.

when q  2 the situation is more complicated. the next theorem classi-

es a rst set of solutions:

theorem 27. if an

sponding to p-forms of degree  q, then it can be completed in a solution of
the wess-zumino consistency condition an

g,q = [pj ]n

g given by,

g = [pa1...amqa1...am]n
an
g .

(6.5)

proof: the -degree of pj is n  q. this implies that it is a sum of terms
of form degrees  n  q. furthermore, since qa1...am only involves the
ghosts of ghosts corresponding to p-forms of degrees  q, the term of
lowest degree occurring in sqa1...am is at least of form degree  q + 1.
therefore spa1...amqa1...am = 0 and an
g is a solution
of the wess-zumino consistency condition.

g = [pa1...amqa1...am]n

we now investigate what happens when an
sponding to p-forms of degrees < q.

m2 satises m2 + n2 + db2 = 0, n2 + dl2 + dc2 = 0, l2 = 0, etc.
using the vocabulary of section 4.2, we will say that the ambiguity in
an
g,qj is the sum of a -cocycle (m0), the rst lift (m1) of a -cocycle,
the second lift (m2) of a -cocycle, etc.

however, none of these ambiguities except m0 in aqp can play a
role in the construction of a non-trivial solution. to see this, we note
that ,  and d conserve the polynomial degree of the variables of
any given sector. we can therefore work at xed polynomial degree
in the variables of all the dierent p-forms. since n1, l2, etc. are
-closed terms which have to be lifted at least once, they have the
generic form r[h, h]q where q has to contain a ghost of ghost of
degree pa < p. because we work at xed polynomial degree, the
presence of such terms imply that pa1...arb1...bs depends on either h a
or on h a. however, if p depends on h a then its component of degree
n is of antighost q  pa + 1 < p + 1 which is in contradiction with our
assumption q > p. this means that p has to depend on h a so that,

100

thus, if pa1...am depends on h a, one can eliminate aq from a by the
addition of trivial terms and the redenition of the terms of antighost
number < q. therefore we may now assume that aq does not contain
h a and that the only ambiguity in the denitions of the aqj is m0 in
aqp.

coboundary condition for antield dependent solutions

in this section we analyze the coboundary condition for the antield depen-
dent solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition.

let an

g = an

g,0 +. . .+an

know that an

g,q is of the form (for q > 1), an

g,q be a brst cocycle. from our general analysis we

g is trivial then there exist cn

g,0 + . . . + en1
according to the antighost number we get:

such that an

g,l

a0 = c1 + c0 + de0,
a1 = c2 + c1 + de1,

...

aq = cq+1 + cq + deq,
0 = cq+2 + cq+1 + deq+1,
...
0 = cl + cl1 + del1,
0 = cl + del.

(6.21)
(6.22)

(6.23)
(6.24)

(6.25)
(6.26)

we have dropped the indices labeling the ghost numbers and form degrees
which are xed. in the above equations, an
g,q appears as the obstruction to
lifting l  q times the term cl.

from our analysis of section 4.3.1 we know that (6.26) implies cl =

qj ()j. if l = q + 1 we then have,

an
g,q = qj ()j + cq + deq.

(6.27)

because q > 1 we may assume that deq = dsj()j + vq and therefore,

[pa1...am(h a, h a)]n

q = qj () + dsj(),

(6.28)

which is not the case since [p ]n

q denes a non-trivial class of h inv(|d).

thus we now assume that l > q + 1 and in that case cl has to be lifted
at least once. according to the analysis of section 4.3.1, the most general
expression for cl is then

cl = [ra1...ar (h a, h a)]n

lqa1...ar
0,g+l .

(6.29)

by examining the calculations performed in the proof of theorem 28 we
conclude that an

g is trivial if and only if an

g,q is given by,

[ma1...arb1...bs(h a, h a)]np1

q+p+1h a1qa2...arb1...bs

0,g+qp

,

(6.30)

6.2 counterterms, rst order vertices and anomalies

103

since this is the obstruction arising when one tries to lift a term of the
form (6.29). in (6.30) the ai label p-forms of the same degree while the bj
label forms of higher degree; furthermore ma1...arb1...bs is symmetric (resp.
antisymmetric) in (a1 . . . ar) if h aj is anticommuting (resp. commuting).

in particular, the brst cocycles described in theorem 28 are not trivial.

results in the algebra of x-dependent forms

the proofs of the previous theorems hold because we have limited our at-
tention to the algebra of x-independent local forms in which the exterior
derivative d maps a polynomial containing i derivatives of the elds onto a
polynomial containing i+1 derivatives of the elds. this observation allowed
us in particular to obtain eq. (6.13) from eq. (6.12) and eq. (6.15) from
eq. (6.14). the complete calculations in the algebra of x-dependent forms
of the brst cocycles will not be done here. instead we give an example to
illustrate the problem.

let us examine a system of 1-forms for which we want to construct in
a
ghost number 1 the solutions corresponding to an
2 c b. by exam-
ining the brst cocycle condition at antighost number 1 one easily gets a1 =
a
1 ab+m1 where m1 can be assumed of the form m1 = (). at antighost
faba
f b + v (f a) + () + d() = 0
number 0 we then have the condition, fabf
which is just eq. (6.14) for our particular example.
in the algebra of x-
independent variables we have seen that this condition implies that the sym-
metric part of fab vanishes.
indeed for the
symmetric part of fab one nds the brst cocycles [28],

in p this is no longer true.

1,2 = faba

(6.31)

these are available in all dimensions except n = 4 where they are actually
described by theorem 26.

6.2 counterterms, rst order vertices and a-

nomalies

using the results of the previous section, we obtain the counterterms, rst-
order vertices and the anomalies which depend non-trivially on the antields.

104

free theory: brst cohomology (part ii)

6.2.1 counterterms and rst order vertices

in ghost number 0, theorems 26, 27 and 28 imply the existence of the
following brst cocycles:

(theorem 26).

1. an

0 = ka(jba + ac a)
0 = [pc(h a, h b)qc]n
0 = [fabc h a bb bc]n

2. an

3. an

0 , where pc has -degree n  pc. (theorem 27).

0 , with fabc completely antisymmetric.

(theorem 28).

the cocycles of the rst and third type are only available for 1-forms.

to obtain the rst order vertices and counterterms one isolates from the
above cocycles the component of antighost number 0. in particular, we see
that a vertex of the yang-mills type is only available for 1-forms.
in the
absence of 1-forms we have:

theorem 29. for a system of free p-form gauge elds with p  2, the coun-
terterms and the rst order vertices are given by,

v = pc(h a, h

b

)bc.

(6.32)

where in (6.32) the form degrees of the various forms present must add up
to n.

for such systems, the rst order vertex pc(h a, h

)bc is as announced a
generalized noether coupling since pc(h a, h
) is a higher order conserved
current. all these vertices have the remarkable property to be linear in the
gauge potentials ba; we stress again that this is in sharp contrast to the
situation where 1-forms are present since in those cases couplings of the
yang-mills type exist.

b

b

to rst order in the coupling constants, the classical action corresponding

to (6.32) reads,

iint =z dnx{xa (cid:0)

1

2(pa + 1)!

h a

1...pa+1h a1...pa+1 + gasa1...pa ba

1...pa(cid:1)},

(6.33)

where sc1...pa are the components of the form dual to p c(h a, h

b

).

this action is no longer gauge invariant under the original gauge trans-
formations. since sa1...pa is gauge invariant and has an on-shell vanishing

6.3 gauge invariance of conserved currents

105

divergence, we have, sa1...pa = ka2...pa
h b1...k, where the ka2...pa
b1...k
b1...k
are gauge invariant. it is then easy to check that up to terms of order g2,
iint is invariant under,

(6.34)

a2...pb

are gauge invariant, the new gauge algebra remains abelian
since the k
up to order g2. another way to see this is to remember from the general
theory that in order to deform the gauge algebra to order g one needs a term
in an

0 which is quadratic in the ghosts.

6.2.2 anomalies

using our analysis we can compute the anomalies of the theory. taking
into account theorems 26, 27 and 28 we obtain in ghost number 1 the
following brst cocycles:

1. an

1 = kab(2jbac b + ac ac b),

for 1-forms

(theorem 26).

1 = ka(jba + ac a), for 2-forms
an
1 = [pc(h a, h b)qc]n

2. an

1 , where pc has -degree n  pc  1.

(theorem 26).

(theorem 27).

1 , with fabc = fabc and where ba is a 1-form

3. an

1 = [fabc h a bb bc]n
and bc a 2-form.
1 = [fabcd h a bb bc bd]n
an
antisymmetric

1 , for 1-forms and where fabcd is completely

(theorem 28).

(theorem 28).

notice that anomalies of type 1 and 2 only exist in the presence of 1-forms

or 2-forms. therefore,

theorem 30. in the absence of 1-forms and 2-forms, the antield dependent
candidate anomalies are given by,

1 = [pc(h a, h b)qc]n
an
1 .

(6.35)

6.3 gauge invariance of conserved currents

in this section we list all the conserved currents which can not be covari-
antized. as we recalled in section 2.3 these are related to the representatives
of h n

1(s|d) for which a = a1 + . . . + aq with q > 1.

106

free theory: brst cohomology (part ii)

the results of section 6.1 imply that these brst cocycles are necessarily

of the form,

1 =[kab h a
an

p+1

bb]n

1 with kab = kba,

(6.36)

where the h a and bb are mixed forms associated to exterior forms of the
same degree.

the global symmetries associated with the component a1 = kabb

the brst cocycles (6.36) are,

a
1 bb of

ba

1...p = ka

bbb

1...p,

(6.37)

and correspond to rotations of the forms ba among themselves since the
generators of these symmetries are antisymmetric matrices kab.

let us now prove that a conserved current j associated to a gauge invari-
ant global symmetry through the relation a1 + dj = 0 can be assumed to be
gauge invariant as well.

proof:

if a1 is gauge invariant, then this is also true of a1. by assumption
we have da1 = 0 since a1 + dj = 0. therefore, according to theorem
6 we have a1 = dr, where r is a gauge invariant polynomial (there
can be no polynomial in h a present in a1 because  and d bring one
derivatives of the ). thus we conclude that up to a d-exact term,
j = r.

conversely, using theorem 16 it is immediate to see that any global
symmetry associated to a gauge invariant conserved current may be assumed
gauge invariant. therefore, we have:

theorem 31. the only conserved currents which cannot be assumed to be
gauge invariant are associated to the global symmetries ba
and given by,

1...p = ka

bbb

1...p

j = kabh

a

bb with kab = kba.

(6.38)

6.4 conclusions

in this section we have computed all the solutions of the wess-zumino consis-
tency condition which depend on the antields. apart from those described
by theorem 26 which related to the conserved currents of the theory, they
are all explicitly known and given by theorems 27 and 28. the latter have

6.5 higher order vertices

107

this extends to antield dependent solutions the similar property we estab-
lished in section 4.2 concerning the antield independent brst cocycles
belonging to non-trivial descents.

from the brst cocycles in ghost number 0, we obtained all the rst-order
vertices, counterterms and anomalies of the theory. we also determined all
the noether conserved currents which are not equivalent to gauge invariant
currents.

in the absence of 1-forms, all the rst order vertices were shown to be of
the noether type (conserved current x potential) and exist only in particular
spacetime dimensions. as a consequence there is in that case no vertex of the
yang-mills type and accordingly no interaction which deforms the algebra of
the gauge transformations at rst order. if 1-forms are present in the system,
one nds additional interactions which are also of the noether form ja.
however, the conserved current j which couples to the 1-form need not be
gauge-invariant. there is actually only one non gauge-invariant current that
is available and it leads to the yang-mills cubic vertex, which deforms the
gauge algebra to order g. all other currents j may be assumed to be gauge-
invariant and thus do not lead to algebra-deforming interactions. there is
in particular no vertex of the form hba where a are 1-forms and b are p-
forms (p > 1) with curvature h, which excludes charged p-forms (i.e. p-forms
transforming in some representation of a lie algebra minimally coupled to a
yang-mills potential).

the anomalies have also been computed and we have shown that for
systems of p-forms of degree  3, they are all linear in the ghosts variables.
when 1-forms and 2-forms are included in the system, one nds additional
anomalies related to the conserved currents of the theory. among these,
there are only two for which the corresponding conserved currents cannot be
made gauge invariant.

some of the above conclusions are based on our analysis of the gauge in-
variant nature of the global symmetries and conserved currents. our results
are: 1) the only global symmetries which are not gauge invariant up to trivial
terms are the rotation of forms among themselves; 2) the only conserved cur-
rents which cannot be improved to become gauge invariant are those related
to these global symmetries.

6.5 higher order vertices

once all the rst order vertices are known, one can pursue the analysis of
the consistent deformations. this is done by requiring that the equation
(s, s) = 0 should be satised to all orders in the coupling constant. one

108

free theory: brst cohomology (part ii)

then obtains a succession of equations which read,

(s0, s0) = 0,
(s0, s1) = 0,
2(s0, s2) + (s1, s1) = 0,
(s0, s3) + (s1, s2) = 0,

...

(6.39)
(6.40)
(6.41)
(6.42)

the construction of the full interacting action s = s0 + gs1 + g2s2 + . . . ,
consistent to all orders, can be obstructed if one equation of the tower fails
to be satised. in this section we investigate this problem for a system of
exterior forms with degrees limited to two values p and q such that 2  p <
q  n  2 and we construct lagrangians which are consistent to all orders in
the coupling constant.

the p-forms are denoted aa (a = 1, . . . m) and the q-forms ba (a =
1, . . . , m); their curvatures f a = daa and h a = dba are respectively (p+1)-
and q + 1-forms. their duals,

1...nf a1...p+1dxp+2 . . . dxn,

1...nh a1...q+1dxq+2 . . . dxn,

(6.43)

(6.44)

are respectively (n  p  1)- and (n  q  1)-forms. in form notation, the free
lagrangian can be written as,

l = 

1

2(p + 1)!

f af a 

1

2(q + 1)!

h ah a.

(6.45)

from the previous section we know that the rst order vertices are exterior
products of form degree n of one of the forms, the curvatures and their duals
and are thus given by,

or

(h a)k(f a)l(h

a

)m(f

a

)raa,

(h a)k(f a)l(h

a

)m(f

a

)rba,

(6.46)

(6.47)

where the form degrees must add up to n. this imposes the condition k(q +
1) + l(p + 1) + m(n  q  1) + r(n  p  1) + p = n in the rst case and
k(q + 1) + l(p + 1) + m(n  q  1) + r(n  p  1) + q = n in the second

6.5 higher order vertices

109

case. furthermore, in order for these vertices to truly deform the gauge
transformations they must contain at least one dual so that m + r > 1.
using those conditions in addition to n > q + 1 > p + 1 one nds only three
types of rst order couplings which truly deform the gauge transformations:

(i) chapline-manton couplings, which are linear in the duals [19, 84, 85, 86,
18],

v1 = z f a
v2 = z f a

af aba, (q = p + 1),

a1...ak+1h af a1 . . . f ak aak+1,

(k(p + 1) + p = q + 1).

(6.48)

(6.49)

a and f a

here, f a
a1...ak+1 are arbitrary constants. the faa1...ak+1 may be assumed
to be completely symmetric (antisymmetric) in the as if p is odd (even).
the chapline-manton coupling (6.48) only exists for q = p + 1 while the
chapline-manton coupling (6.49) only exists if there is some integer k such
that k(p + 1) + p = q + 1.

(ii) freedman-townsend couplings, which are quadratic in the duals [16],

v3 = z f a
v4 = z ta

bch

f aab.

(6.50)

(6.51)

here, f a
ab are constants arbitrary at rst order but restricted at
second order. the freedman-townsend vertices (6.50) and (6.51) only exist
for q = n  2.

(iii) generalized couplings, which are at least quadratic in the duals h

v5 =z ka1...al

a1...ak+1h a1...h alf a1...f ak aak+1

(6.52)

where ka1...al
a1...ak+1 are arbitrary constants with the obvious symmetries. these
interactions exist only if there are integers k, l (with l  2) such that l(n 
q  1) + k(p + 1) + p = n.

we next show how the above rst order vertices can be extended to higher

orders in order to obtain a theory which is consistent to all orders.

110

free theory: brst cohomology (part ii)

6.5.1 chapline-manton couplings

instead of using the master equation (s, s) = 0 to get the higher order
vertices, it is sometimes easier to try to guess the full interacting action and
then show that without imposing any conditions on the arbitrary parameters
of the rst order vertex, one has a consistent deformation in the sense recalled
in the introduction. the antibracket analysis is then facultative. this is
how we proceed for the chapline-manton couplings (6.48), (6.49) and the
generalized couplings (6.52).

for v1, the complete lagrangian which reduces to l + v1 at order 1 in the

coupling constant is:

aa  aa + da  gf a

aa, ba  ba + da,

(6.54)

from which it follows that li,1 is gauge invariant under (6.54) to all orders.
for v2, the role of the p-form and the q-form are in a certain sense ex-

changed. the complete lagrangian is:

li,2 = 

1

(p + 1)!

f af a 

1

(6.55)

with h a
the improved eld strengths are invariant under the gauge transforma-
tions:

2

aa  aa + da, ba  ba + da  ()k(q+1)gf a

a1...ak+1f a1 . . . f akak+1,

(6.56)

from which it follows that li,2 is gauge invariant under (6.56) to all orders.
in both cases, the number of elds, gauge invariances and order of re-
ducibility are the same as for the free theory. let us check this explicitly for
v1. the elds are aa and ba; their gauge transformations (6.56) are not all
independent since they vanish when a and a are of the form,

a = da + gf a

aa,

a = da.

(6.57)

from (6.57) we see that the number of parameters in the reducibility iden-
tities of order 1 are the same for the free theory and li,1. in the same way,

6.5 higher order vertices

111

one shows that this property also holds for the reducibility identities at all
orders.

furthermore, no restrictions on the coecients f a

a1...ak+1 are im-
posed so the antibracket analysis is not required. therefore, li,1 and li,2
are the most general consistent interactions corresponding to v1 and v2.

a and f a

6.5.2 generalized couplings

before examining the freedman-townsend couplings, we study the gener-
alized couplings because as in the chapline-manton case, no antibracket
analysis is required.

first-order formulation a convenient way to analyze the freedman-
townsend couplings and the generalized couplings is to reformulate those
theories by introducing auxiliary elds. this has the advantage that the full
interacting theories are then polynomial.

in the rst-order formulation, the lagrangian (6.45) is replaced by,

l =

eliminated).

the following gauge transformations:

(6.62)

where  = l

is needed to achieve gauge invariance. furthermore, as in the case of v1 it is
easy to show that the number of elds, gauge parameters and the order of
reducibility after elimination of a are the same as for the free theory (6.58).

using our results on the antield dependent anomalies, we see that the r.h.s.

only be s-exact if these two terms vanish which means that the conditions
(6.66) and (6.67) are needed1.

bc satises the requirements (6.66,6.67). one recovers the action they obtain upon
elimination of the auxiliary elds. their approach is complementary to ours and is based
on the gauging of a global symmetry of the free lagrangian (3.2).

6.5.4 remarks

1) for the three types of couplings described above, the algebra of the
gauge transformations remains abelian on-shell to all orders in the coupling
constant. this is a particularity of systems which contain exterior forms of
degrees limited to two values. indeed, with three (or more) degrees, one can
modify the algebra at order g2. for instance, if a, b and c are respectively 3-
, 4- and 7-forms, the lagrangian  f f +h h +gg is invariant under the
gauge transformations a = d + g, b = d and c = d + gdb  g2b,
where ,  and  are respectively 2-, 3- and 6-forms. here, f = da  gb,
h = db and g = dc  gadb + (1/2)g2b2. the commutator of two -
transformations is a -transformation with  = g212. this model will be
studied in detail in chapter 7 where we discuss the brst cohomology for
chapline-manton models.

2) the interaction vertices of this section are still available in the presence

of 1-forms. they just fail to exhaust all the possible vertices.

3) the basic interaction vertices described above can of course be com-
bined, or can be combined with chern-simons terms. this leads, in general,
to additional constraints on their coecients (which may actually have no
non trivial solutions in some cases). one example of a non-trivial combina-
tion is the description of massive vector elds worked out in [16, 31], which
combines the freedman-townsend vertex with a chern-simons term [87].
another example is given in [88], where both the freedman-townsend ver-
tex and the yang-mills vertex are introduced simultaneously.

chapter 7

chapline-manton models

7.1 introduction

in the previous chapter we studied the brst cohomology for a system of free
p-forms. from this analysis we were able to get all the rst order vertices that
could be added to the free lagrangian. we have proved that except for those
which are strictly gauge invariant, the interactions are quite constrained,
i.e., for a xed spacetime dimension, a given system of p-forms only allows
for a nite number of consistent vertices (even to rst order). this result
complements the geometric analysis performed in [17] where it is shown that
the non-abelian yang-mills construction cannot be generalized to p-forms
viewed as connections for extended objects.
[topological eld theory oers
ways to bypass some of the diculties [89], but will not be discussed here].
in this chapter we present the brst cohomology for dierent chapline-
manton couplings. these are particularly interesting because their gauge
algebra remains closed o-shell and the reducibility identities hold strongly
even after the interactions are switched on. using those properties one can
study their cohomologies essentially along the lines drawn for the system of
free p-forms.

for the other couplings, the new gauge algebra generally closes only on-
shell and the reducibility identities become on-shell relations. this occurs
for the freedman-townsend interaction (6.63) and also for the generalized
in those cases, 2  0 and it becomes meaningless to
couplings (6.61).
consider the cohomology of  since it is no longer a dierential. one cannot
therefore study antield independent brst cocycles as we did in the free
case; the antields must be incorporated from the beginning.

in section 6.5 we have limited our study of chapline-manton couplings to
a system of forms of only two dierent degrees. however, chapline-manton

116

chapline-manton models

type interactions can be constructed for more general systems of p-forms
along the lines discussed in [20]. rather than facing the general case, which
would lead to non informative and uncluttered formulas, we shall illustrate
the general construction through four particular example.

chapline-manton models are characterized by gauge-invariant curvatures
h a which dier from the free ones by terms proportional to the coupling
constant g,

h a = dba + ga + o(g2).

the gauge transformations are,

ba = da + ga + o(g2).

(7.1)

(7.2)

here, a is a sum of exterior products of bs and dbs  which must match the
form degree of dba  while a is a sum of exterior products of bs, dbs and
s (linear in the s). the modied curvatures and gauge transformations
must fulll the consistency condition,

h a = 0,

(7.3)

which means that the modied curvatures should be invariant under the
modied gauge transformations. furthermore, o-shell reducibility must be
preserved, i.e., ba should identically vanish for a = da + a for some ap-
propriate a(, b, db, g). the lagrangian being a function of the curvatures
and their derivatives, l = l([h a
1...pa+1]) is automatically gauge-invariant.
to completely dene the model, it is thus necessary to specify, besides the
eld spectrum, the modied curvatures and the gauge transformations leav-
ing them invariant. in many cases, the curvatures are modied by the addi-
tion of chern-simons forms of same degree, but this is not the only possibility
as example 3 below indicates. in the sequel we set the coupling constant g
equal to one.

7.2 the models

the rst example contains one p-form, denoted a  ap
denoted b  bp+1

. the new eld strengths are,

0, and one (p+1)-form,

f = da + b, h = db,

while the modied gauge transformations take the form,

,a = d  ,
,b = d,

117

(7.5)
(7.6)

where  is a (p  1)-form and  a p-form. the gauge transformations are
abelian and remain reducible o-shell since the particular gauge parameters
 = d+,  = d clearly do not aect the elds. the brst transformations
of the undierentiated elds and ghosts are,

sapk

k+1 = 0,

for the a-variables, and

sbp+1k

k+1 = 0,
p+1 = 0,

(k = 0, . . . , p) for the b-ones. one has,

sf = 0 = sh.

(7.7)

(7.8)
(7.9)

(7.10)

this model describes in fact a massive (p + 1)-form. one can indeed use
the gauge freedom of b to set a = 0. once this is done, one is left with the
lagrangian of a massive (p + 1)-form.

the brst action of this model can be written as,

sb1...p+1j =  b1...p+1j + ()j+1a1...p+1j .

(7.13)
(7.14)
(7.15)

(7.16)

the action of s on the elds, antields and ghosts decomposes (as in the
free theory) as the sum of the koszul-tate dierential and the longitudinal
exterior derivative: s =  +  with s

a and sa = a.

a =

f = da, h = db + f ra,

with f r  f f    f (r times). the gauge transformations read,

,a = d,
,b = d  f r,

and they clearly leave the curvatures invariant.

the action of s on the elds, antields and ghosts decomposes as in the
free theory as the sum of the koszul-tate dierential and the longitudinal
exterior derivative: s =  + . however, here there are two undesirable fea-
tures. first, the variation of a involves contributions of antighost number
0 so that a 6= 0. furthermore, sa also contains the undierentiated
elds a which are not invariant under the gauge transformations. this is
in contrast with the free theory where all the antields were in h() and
their variations were invariant. both defects can be corrected by making the
following invertible transformations,

a  a

in terms of the above variables, the brst dierential suers once more
from some defects. first it has a component of antighost number 1, e.g.
cabcc ac b in (7.82), as a consequence of which the brst dierential does
not split as the sum of the koszul-tate dierential and the longitudinal exte-
rior derivative. the second undesirable feature is that the brst variations
of the antields of the yang-mills sector contain contributions which are not
covariant under the gauge transformations, e.g. h aa in (7.82). one
can remedy both problems by redening the antields of the yang-mills sec-
tor according to the following invertible transformations:

chapline-manton models

7.3 cohomology of 

the cohomology h () of the chapline-manton model can be worked out as
in the free case, by exhibiting explicitly the contractible part of the algebra.
this contractible part typically gets larger with the coupling: some cocycles
are removed from h (). this happens for the models 1, 3 and 4.

chapline-manton model 1

in the absence of couplings, the -cohomology for the rst model is given,
according to theorem 3, by the polynomials in (da)1...p+1, (db)1...p+2, the
antields, their derivatives and the last ghosts a0
p+1. when the coupling
is turned on, however, some of these x-variables become contractible pairs
and get canceled in cohomology. specically, it is the last ghosts of ghosts
that disappear.

p, b0

indeed, as in the proof of theorem 3 one can replace the original variables

by,

(1...k a[1)1...l]2, 2...k f 0

11...l, (1...kb[1)1...l]2, and 2...k h11...l,

(7.92)

with f 0
1...l = [1a2...r] (2  r  p) and h1...l = [1b2...l] (2 
l  p + 1). one then makes a further change of coordinates by replacing
f 0
1...l with f1...l = [1a2...r]  b1...r , which is obviously invertible.
the variables can now be associated as in theorem 3 except that a new
contractible pair appears, i.e., a0
p = b0
p+1; the x-variables are now made of
the h1...l, f1...l and their derivatives.

the important point which makes the argument correct is that f 0

1...l
and f1...l only dier by terms which are of lower order in the derivatives of
the a-sector (here they even dier only by variables of the b-sector). as this
property also holds for the other chapline-manton models, the same change
of variables will also be possible.

note that the bianchi identities for the new eld strengths read

df = h, dh = 0.

(7.93)

they can be used to express the h-components and their derivatives in terms
of the components f1...p+1 and their derivatives, which thus completely
generate the cohomology.

to summarize, we have proved:

7.3 cohomology of 

125

theorem 32. for the chapline-manton model 1, the cohomology h() is
given by the polynomials in the improved eld strength components f1...p+1,
the antields and their derivatives,

 = 0   =

1
q!

1...q([f1...p+1], [

a])dx1 . . . dxq.

(7.94)

in particular, there is no cohomology at non-vanishing pureghost number.

the situation is very similar to the discussion of the gauged principal

u(1) sigma model [92] (see also [93] in this context).

chapline-manton model 2

in this case, the change of variables proceeds as for model 1 so that the -
cohomology is unchanged compared with the free case except that the free
curvatures are replaced by the improved, gauge invariant curvatures (7.17).
the last ghosts remain in cohomology because a(0,1) is still -closed, so the
mechanism of the previous subsection is not operative. we thus have,

theorem 33. the cohomology of  for the chapline-manton model 2, is
given by

h() = i  c

(7.95)

1 and
2r, and where i is the algebra generated by the gauge invariant eld strength

where c is the algebra generated by the last, undierentiated ghosts a0
b0
components f, h1...2r+1, the antields and their derivatives.

note the new form of the bianchi identities on the curvatures,

df = 0, dh = f r+1.

(7.96)

chapline-manton model 3

the discussion of the third example proceeds to a large extent like that of
the rst one. the last ghosts of ghosts a0
2 form a contractible pair
and disappear in cohomology; the improved last ghost of ghost

1 and b0

c 0

3 = c 0

in the absence of coupling, the cohomology of  is given by the tensor prod-
uct of the pure yang-mills cohomology [94, 95, 96, 97, 62, 63, 48, 98] and of
the free 2-form cohomology. we collectively denote by 0 (i) the yang-mills
eld strengths, their covariant derivatives d1 . . . dkf a
, the antields and
a ,d1 . . . dkc 
their covariant derivatives d1 . . . dk a
a; these transform ac-
cording to the adjoint representation; and (ii) the free 2-form eld strengths
h 0
 = (db), their derivatives, the antields b , , , their deriva-
tives and the undierentiated ghost of ghost . then the representatives of

h() in the uncoupled case can be written as a =pj j (0)j(c a), where

the j (0) are invariant polynomials (under su(n)) in the 0 and where
the j(c a) form a basis of the lie algebra cohomology of the lie algebra of
the gauge group. the j are polynomials in the so-called primitive forms,
i.e trc 3, trc 5 if trc 5 6= 0, etc.

when the chern-simons coupling is turned on, the results are very similar
but with two modications: (i) one must replace in the above cocycles the
free eld strengths h 0
 and their derivatives by the improved invariant eld
strengths h and their derivatives (we shall denote the new set of improved
variables dened in this manner by ); (ii) the ghost of ghost  and the
primitive form trc 3 now drop from the cohomology since these elements are
related by  = 
3 trc 3, which indicates that trc 3 is exact, while  is no longer
closed. this last feature underlies the green-schwarz anomaly cancellation
mechanism. we thus have:

theorem 35. the cohomology of  for the chapline-manton model 4 is
given by,

h() = j  d,

(7.100)

7.4 h(s|d) - antield independent solutions

127

where (i) j is the algebra of the invariant polynomials in the yang-mills cur-
vature components, the antields and their covariant derivatives, as well as
in the components of the gauge invariant curvature h and their derivatives;
and (ii) d is the algebra generated by the primitive forms trc 5, trc 7, ...,
trc 2n 1.

we recall that the lie algebra cohomology for su(n) is generated by the
primitive forms trc 3, trc 5, ... up to trc 2n 1 [65, 99]. the bianchi identities
read,

df = 0, dh = trf 2.

(7.101)

7.4 h(s|d) - antield independent solutions

7.4.1 covariant poincare lemma

in the free case, we have shown that the various spaces ek, k > 0 used in the
lifts of elements of h() might be calculated in the so-called small algebra.
this result relies upon the invariant poincare lemma which states that each
class of the invariant cohomology of d has a representative in a. we now
show that it is also the case for the chapline-manton models and therefore
that a is again the relevant space in which to calculate the spaces ek, k > 0.
one has,

theorem 36. let p be a gauge invariant polynomial. if p is closed, then
p is the sum of a closed, gauge invariant polynomial belonging to the small
algebra and of the exterior derivative of an invariant polynomial,

dp = 0  p = q + dr, q  a, dq = 0,

(7.102)

(with p , q and r all gauge-invariant). furthermore, if q is d-exact in the
algebra of gauge-invariant polynomials, q = ds with s gauge-invariant, one
may assume that s is in the small algebra (and gauge-invariant). therefore,
the invariant cohomology of d can be evaluated in a instead of the bigger
algebra p.

note that while in the free case the conditions q  a and q = ds (with

s gauge-invariant) imply q = 0, this is no longer true here.

proof: we shall prove the theorem for the specic case of the second
model. the proof proceeds in the same way for the other models. we

128

chapline-manton models

introduce a grading n that counts the number of derivatives of the b
eld. according to this grading p and d split as,

p = pk + pk1 +    + p1 + p0, d = d1 + d0,

(7.103)

with,

n(pi) = i, n(di) = i.

(7.104)

the dierential d1 takes derivatives only of the b-eld, the dierential
d0 takes derivatives only of the a-eld. because p is gauge-invariant,
the b-eld enters p only through the components of db and their
derivatives. furthermore, even though the pis with i < k may involve
the components as and their symmetrized derivatives, pk depends
on a only through the f and their derivatives.

the equation dp = 0 yields d1pk = 0 at the highest value of the
n-degree. according to the results for the free case, this implies pk
= d1rk1 + mk where rk1 is a polynomial in the components of db
and their derivatives, while mk is a polynomial in the form db, both
with coecients made of the components of f and their derivatives
(which fulll d1f = 0). one then covariantize rk1 and mk by
completing db into h. this only introduces terms of lower n-degree.
we denote the covariant objects by r and m, respectively. one has
pk = [dr + m]k and p = drk1 + mk + more, where more is
an invariant polynomial of maximum n-degree strictly smaller than
k. the invariant polynomial m - which exists only if k = 1 or 0
since h 2 = 0 - is of order k in the exterior form h.
it must be
closed by itself since there can be no compensation between d0m and
d1(more) which is necessarily of lower degree in the components of h
and their derivatives. it follows from d0m = 0 that m = (f, h)+ds,
where  is a polynomial in the forms f and h and where s is an
invariant polynomial (using again the results for the free case and
hdp = d(hp) + more). thus one can get rid of pk by adding to p
terms of the form (7.102) of the theorem. by repeating the argument
at the successive lower degrees, one reaches the desired conclusion.

to prove the second part of the theorem, one rst observes that
if dq = 0, then q(f, h) does in fact not involve h, q = q(f )
(because d((f ) + (f )h) = 0  (f )f r+1 = 0  (f ) = 0).
assume then that q = du, where u is a gauge-invariant polynomial,
u = u([h], [f ]). by expanding u according to the n-degree, u =
u0 + u1 + ... + ul, one nds at higher order d1ul = 0, which implies
as above ul = d1rl1 + ml where ml is a polynomial in the form db.

7.4 h(s|d) - antield independent solutions

129

one can remove d1rl1 from ul by subtracting drl1 from u, which
does not aect q. thus, only ml, which is present for l = 1 or l = 0,
is relevant. by repeating the argument, one nally arrives at,

u = ha([f ]) + b([f ]).

(7.105)

the condition q = du further implies da = 0 and thus a = d([f ]) +
(f ) where (f ) is a polynomial in the form f . the term hd([f ])
is irrelevant since it can be absorbed into b([f ]) with a d-exact term.
thus, u = h(f ) + b([f ]). the condition q(f ) = du now reads
q(f ) = k(f ) + db([f ]) where k(f ) is a polynomial in f and implies
db = 0 (invariant poincare lemma in the free case). but then, again,
one can drop b from u, which proves the second assertion.

it follows from this theorem that there is no restriction in investigating the
invariant d-cohomology in the small algebra. elements of h() that can
be lifted at least once necessarily belong to a up to trivial terms. there
is no restriction in the investigation of the next lifts either because again
esmall
 e1. if a -cocycle a  a can be written as a = du + v where u
and v are in the big algebra and u = 0, then one may nd u and v in a
such that a = du + v (with u = 0). this follows from the second part of
the theorem. obstructions to lifts within a cannot be removed by going to
the big algebra.

1

chapline-manton model 1

for the rst chapline-manton model discussed above, the invariant coho-
mology of d is trivial.
indeed, in the algebra generated by f and h, the
dierential d takes the contractible form df = h, dh = 0. thus

e1  h(d0, esmall

0

) = 0

(7.106)

where esmall

0

is the algebra generated by f and h.

chapline-manton model 2

in the algebra generated by the gauge-invariant curvatures, d takes the form

df = 0, dh = f r+1.

(7.107)

since h 2 = 0, any element in this algebra is of the form

a = (f ) + (f )h,

(7.108)

130

chapline-manton models

where (f ) and (f ) are polynomials in f. the condition that a is closed
implies (f )f k+1 = 0, which forces (f ) to vanish. furthermore a  (f )
is exact if it is in the ideal generated by f r+1. thus, we have the theorem:

theorem 37. the invariant cohomology of d for the chapline-manton mo-
del 2 is the quotient of the algebra generated by the f s by the ideal generated
by f r+1.

chapline-manton model 3

for the third model, d is given by (7.99). by redening the curvature g as

gm = g 

f 2
2

,

(7.109)

the algebra is brought to the form

df = h, dh = 0, dgm = 0,

(7.110)

from which it follows that:

theorem 38. for the third model, the invariant cohomology of d is given
by the polynomials in the variable gm = g  f 2/2.

chapline-manton model 4

the invariant polynomials in the small algebra are the polynomials in the
gauge-invariant curvature h of the 2-form and in the fundamental invari-
ants trf 2, trf 3, ... trf n for su(n) (this is a basis for the su(n) symmet-
ric polynomials). these polynomials are all closed, except h, which obeys
dh = trf 2. hence, h and trf 2 do not appear in the cohomology.

theorem 39. for the fourth model, the invariant cohomology of d is given
by the polynomials in trf 3, trf 4, ... trf n .

7.4.2 results

we can now compute the various ek for the chapline-manton models.

chapline-manton model 1

the analysis is obvious in this case since there is no non trivial descent.
all solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition can be taken to be
strictly annihilated by , i.e., can be taken to be in e0 (e1 = 0). they are
thus completely described by theorem 32 (from which one must remove the
d-exact terms d([f ])).

the second model is more interesting. using theorem 37 we know that

the relation f r+1 = 0. this is no longer a free algebra contrary to the
situation encountered in the free case.

the dierential d1 is non trivial and given by,

d1a0

1 = f, d1f = 0, d1b0

2r = 0,

(7.111)

when r > 1, which we shall assume at rst. because f is subject to the
relation f r+1 = 0, the cohomological space e2  h(d1, e1) is isomorphic to
the algebra generated by b0

2r and (a, f ) with

(a, f ) = a0

1f r.

(7.112)

one can take for f1 the space of polynomials of the form (b0
2r)lql(f )a0
1
where ql is a polynomial in f of degree strictly less than r. to obtain the
lifts of these cocycles, one can use modied russian formulas:

 b = h  f a,  a = f,

(7.113)

with b = b0
l(b0

1 + b2

0 and a = a0

1 + a1

0. the lifts are therefore,

2r1ql(f )a0

2r)lql(f )a1

e2r1. one has

thus e2r = 0.

d2r1b0

2r = (a, f ), d2r1(a, f ) = 0.

(7.114)

one may take for f2r1 the space of polynomials in b0

2r (with no constant

piece). the k-th lift of the monomial (b0

2r)l = [( b)l)]0

2rl is [( b)l)]k

2rlk.

note in particular that (a, f ) does not appear in any of the spaces fk,
because it is now trivial.
in the free case, (a, f ) was an element of f1
and the bottom of a non-trivial descent of length two. the coupling to the
2r-form makes it disappear from the cohomology. at the same time, the
cocycle f r+1, which was in the invariant cohomology of d in the free case, is
now d-exact in the space of invariant polynomials. also, while b0
2r could be
transgressed all the way up to h in the free case, its lift now stops at ghost
number one with .

the situation for r = 1 is similar. the two steps corresponding to the
dierentials d1 and d2r1 are now combined in a single one so that the space
e2 vanishes. the easiest way to see this is to observe that h(d1, e1) (with

132

chapline-manton models

d1a(0,1) = f , d1f = 0 and d1b(0,2) = (a, f ) for r = 1) is isomorphic to
h(d, e0) with da(0,1) = f , df = 0, dh = f r+1, db(0,2) = (a, f ) + h.
indeed, one may view the generator h as koszul generator for the equation
f r+1 = 0. the change of variable h  h  = h +  brings then d to the
manifestly contractible form.

chapline-manton model 3

the third model is essentially a combination of the rst model in the (a, b)-
sector and of the free model for the improved 3-form cm = c  ab  1

with curvature gm = dcm and improved last ghost of ghost c (0,3) (7.97).

the cohomology h(|d) for the 2-form has been studied in section 4.2.6
while h(|d) for yang-mills theory has been extensively studied in the lit-
erature [58, 60]. here we only highlight the points which are relevant when
the two models interact.

in the absence of coupling, the non trivial dierentials are,

d2b0

2 = h, d2h = 0,

(b0

2  ) and

d3trc 3 = trf 2, d3trf 2 = 0,

7.4 h(s|d) - antield independent solutions

133

(see [58]). we have here only written down explicitly the actions of the non
trivial dks on the contractible pairs. the last ghost of ghost b0
2 is non trivial
and can be lifted twice; trc 3 is non trivial and can be lifted three times;
trc 5 is non trivial and can be lifted ve times; more generally, trc 2k+1 is
non trivial and can be lifted (2k + 1) times.

when the coupling is turned on, the variables  and trc 3 disappear from
the -cohomology. it follows that all the solutions of the wess-zumino con-
sistency condition that previously were above a polynomial in  and trc 3
disappear or become trivial. this last feature is known as the green-schwarz
anomaly cancellation mechanism [100]. at the same time, the dierential d0
becomes non trivial, as for the previous chapline-manton models. one has

d0h = trf 2, d0trf 2 = 0

(7.122)

which explicitly shows that trf 2 disappears from the invariant cohomology.
the other dierentials (7.119) through (7.121) remain unchanged.

7.4.3 counterterms and anomalies

as in the free case, we summarize the previous results by producing explic-
itly the antield-independent counterterms and anomalies, i.e., h n
0 (|d) and
h n

1 (|d).

counterterms and anomalies of type a

the counterterms that lead to a trivial descent involve in general the individ-
ual components of the gauge-invariant eld strengths and their derivatives
and cannot generically be expressed as exterior products of the forms f or
h. they are the gauge-invariant polynomials and read explicitly,

a = a([f ])dnx,

for the chapline-manton model 1,

a = a([f ], [h])dnx,

for the chapline-manton model 2,

a = a([f ], [g])dnx,

for the chapline-manton model 3 and,

a = pi([f ], [h])dnx,

(7.123)

(7.124)

(7.125)

(7.126)

134

chapline-manton models

for the chapline-manton model 4, where pi is an invariant function of f a

and their covariant derivatives, as well as of [h].

in order for those counterterms to be non-trivial a should satisfy a 6= db in
all cases which is equivalent to the condition that its variational derivatives
with respect to the elds do not identically vanish.

we have assumed that the spacetime forms dx could occur only through

the product dx0dx1    dxn1  dnx as is required by lorentz-invariance.

the anomalies that lead to a trivial descent are sums of terms of the form
a = p c dnx where p is a gauge-invariant polynomial and c is a last ghost
of ghost of ghost number one, which must be non trivial in h(). these
anomalies exist only in the chapline-manton model 2 which has last ghost
of ghosts with ghost number one. one has explicitly,

a = p ([f ], [h])a0

1dnx

(second cm models).

(7.127)

a will be trivial if and only if p = dr([f ], [h]). indeed, if a is trivial then it is
of the form, a = c+de with e+dm = 0, where e is of ghost number one and
form degree n  1. using the results of section 7.4.2 we see that no element
of an fk can be lifted on a solution in ghost number one and form degree
n  1. therefore, up to irrelevant terms, e is of the form e = r([f ], [h])a0
1
which implies p = dr([f ], [h]).

7.4.4 counterterms of type b

as in the free case (section 4.2.8), we determine the solutions a which de-
scend non-trivially starting directly from the obstruction p = da since the
invariant cohomology of d is known.

chapline-manton model 1

there is in this case no non trivial solution of type b since there is no non
trivial descent.

chapline-manton model 2

one may proceed as for the free theory. the polynomial p = da must
be taken in the invariant cohomology of d and so is a polynomial in the
curvatures f with f r+1 identied with zero. this implies,

da = f m+1 = d(f ma) with m < r.

(7.128)

as in the free theory,this leads to the chern-simons terms,

a = f ma,

(7.129)

7.4 h(s|d) - antield independent solutions

135

except that f ra is now absent because it can be brought into class a by
the addition of exact terms. however, due to the restriction m < r, these
chern-simons terms are never of form degree n and therefore, they do not
contribute to the counterterms.

chapline-manton model 3

in this case, the obstruction p = da is a polynomial in the improved eld
strength gm . therefore, one has p = dq(gm , cm ) and so up to trivial terms
a = q(gm , cm ) = r(gm )cm and a is linear in the improved potential cm .
the chern-simons solution q exists only in spacetime dimension 4k  1.

chapline-manton model 4

again, one nds as solutions the familiar higher order yang-mills chern-
simons not involving trf 2 or 3. these are only available in odd dimensions
> 3.

7.4.5 anomalies of type b

as in the free theory, the anomalies a of type b can be of two types. they
can arise from an obstruction that lives one dimension higher or from an
obstruction that lives two dimensions higher.

in the rst case, the obstruction da has form degree n + 1 and ghost
number 1. this case is only possible in the second chapline-manton model
2, since there is no -cohomology in ghost number one for the other models.
the obstruction da reads,

da + (something) = p (f )a0
1.

(7.130)

the right-hand side of (7.130) is necessarily the dk of some element in fk1
of ghost number > 1. according to the results of section 7.4.2 we see that
the only term which has as obstruction a polynomial of the form p (f )a0
1 is
b0
which is not of form degree
n. there is thus no anomaly in this case.

2r. however, the corresponding lift a is b2r1

1

in the second case, the anomaly can be lifted once, da + b = 0. the

obstruction db to a further lift is then a (n + 2)-form of ghost number 0.

there is no solution of this type for the chapline-manton model 1 because

of the lack of a non-trivial descent.

for the chapline-manton model 2, there is again no anomaly that can
be lifted once since the obstruction db = kf m  h inv(d) cannot be of form-
degree n + 2 due to the restriction m < r + 1.

136

chapline-manton models

for the chapline-manton model 3, solutions descending from polynomials
p (gm ) in two dimensions higher exist only in spacetime dimensions equal to
4k  2. they are given by a = q(gm )lm with lm dened in section 7.4.2
above.

finally, for the chapline-manton model 4, one has all the anomalies of
the su(n) pure yang-mills theory, except those involving the cocycle trc 3
and its lifts which are now trivial.

7.5 h(s|d) - antield dependent solutions

the calculation of the antield dependent solutions of the wess-zumino con-
sistency condition for the chapline-manton models proceeds in very much
the same way as for the free theory.

to begin with, one repeats the analysis of section 4.3.1. in particular,
theorem 11 which states that there can be no non-trivial descents in h(|d)
involving the antields remains valid. using this result, it is again easy to
prove that up to allowed redenitions, the component of highest antighost
number of a brst cocycle can be written as,

an
g,q = pjj .

(7.131)

in (7.131), pj is in the invariant cohomology h inv(|d) while the j are a
basis of the polynomials in the ghosts belonging to h().

to make use of this result we must calculate h inv(|d) for the chapline-
manton models. this is the subject of the next section. afterwards, we
will study which of the terms (7.131) can be completed by components of
lower antighost numbers to produce solutions of the wess-zumino consistency
condition.

7.5.1

invariant characteristic cohomology

the calculation of the cohomology h inv(|d) proceeds virtually identically for
the four chapline-manton models considered. one decomposes the represen-
tatives of h inv(|d) and the koszul-tate dierential  according to specic
degrees in order to use the results on the invariant characteristic cohomology
for the free theory. to avoid repetition, the method will only be explicited
for the rst chapline-manton model.

chapline-manton model 1

theorem 40. for the chapline-manton model 1, the invariant characteris-
tic cohomology h inv(|d) in antighost > 1 and form degree n vanishes.

7.5 h(s|d) - antield dependent solutions

137

proof:

let us rst recall for this cm model the action of the koszul-tate

dierential on the antields,

a1...p = f 1...p,
a1...pj = a1...pj ,
b1...p+1 = h 1...p+1  f 1...p+1,
b1...p+1j = b1...p+1j + ()j+1a1...p+1j .

(7.132)
(7.133)
(7.134)

(7.135)

in the absence of coupling, theorem 25 indicates that the invariant
characteristic cohomology in antighost > 1 and form degree n is given
by the linear combinations of the monomials [ h m( f 0)l]n
q with f 0 =
da.

when the coupling is turned on, there are two modications in the
denition of the koszul-tate dierential: in (7.132) the curvature f 0
is replaced by the improved curvature f = da + b; in (7.134) and
(7.135) there are some extra (invariant) terms in the variations of the
antields of the b-sector.

to obtain the elements a of h inv(|d) in the interacting case, we
rst decompose a according to the number of derivatives of the invari-
ant variables (eld strengths, antields): a = a0 + . . . + ak. according
to this degree  splits as 1 + 0; 1 increases by one the number of
derivatives of the invariants while 0 leaves it unchanged and has a
non-vanishing action only on the antields of the b-sector.

at highest degree in the derivatives, eq. a + db = 0 implies,

1ak + dbk = 0.

(7.136)

the dierential 1 is identical to the koszul-tate dierential of the free
theory except for the substitution f 0  f with the consequence that
f is now subject to the bianchi identity df = h instead of df 0 = 0.
to properly take this into account we decompose the solutions c of

1c + dm = 0,

(7.137)

according to the polynomial degree of the a-sector. according to this
degree we have 1 = f +  where: 1) f has the same action on
the antields as the koszul-tate dierential of the free theory; 2) 
decreases the polynomial degree in a and has a vanishing action on
all the antields except a1...p for which a1...p = b1...p. if
we set c = c0 + . . .+ cl, (7.137) implies f cl + dml = 0 where cl is now a
polynomial in f 0
1...p+1 and h1...p+2. using the results on h inv(|d)

138

chapline-manton models

for the free case we then have, cl = l[ h rl( f 0)l]n
q + f ([f 0], [h]) +
d([f 0], [h]) for l > 0 with l a constant. by a redenition of the
terms of lower polynomial degree in the a-sector and the addition of
trivial terms we conclude that c = c0 + . . . cl1 + l[ h rl f l]n
q , where
c0 + . . . + cm1 is of maximal order m  1 in the variables of the a-
sector and has to satisfy (7.137) on its own. by recurrence we thus
have up to trivial terms c = 0[ h r0]n

7.5.2 results

using the above four theorems we can continue our construction of the an-
tield dependent solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition. here,
we will focus our attention on the counterterms and the anomalies. the
other values of the ghost number are analyzed similarly.

7.5 h(s|d) - antield dependent solutions

139

counterterms and anomalies of type i

as in the free case, the representatives of h(s|d) for which the expansion
according to the antighost number stops at order 1 are related to the gauge
invariant conserved currents of the theory. these solutions exist a priori for
the four cm models and are given by,

g = ka1...ar (jqa1...ar
an

1,g + aqa1...ar

0,g+1 ),

(7.138)

where the ka1...ar are constants and the a form a complete set of non-trivial
gauge invariant global symmetries of the model and satisfy a + dj = 0.

counterterms and anomalies of the form (7.138) exist only if the coho-
mology h() has non-trivial elements in pureghost number 1 or 2. this
occurs only in the chapline-manton model 2. if r = 1, the counterterms and
anomalies are given respectively by,

g = k(ja1
an
g = k(jb1
an

0 + aa0
1)
1 + ab0
2)

(counterterm),

(anomaly).

(7.139)

(7.140)

if r > 1 then only the counterterms (7.139) are present.

counterterms and anomalies of type ii

the counterterms and anomalies of this type correspond to solutions of the
wess-zumino consistency condition for which the expansion according to the
antighost number stops at order  2.

chapline-manton model 1 there is no counterterm or anomaly of this
type because the cohomology h() vanishes at pureghost number > 0. al-
ternatively, one can view the absence of solutions of type ii as a consequence
of theorem 40.

chapline-manton model 2 for this model, the ghosts of ghosts avail-
able to construct the component of highest antighost number of a brst
cocycle are a0
2r. combining this with theorem 41, we obtain for
the counterterms an
1 and for the anomalies
1,2r1 = k[ h 2]n
an
g,q = an
2r (the last
term is only available in spacetime dimension n = 2r + 3).

1,2r1 = k[f h]n

0,2r+1 = k[ h]n

g,q = an

2r or an

g,q = an

2r1b0

the an

g,q corresponding to the anomalies are easily completed into solu-
tions of the wess-zumino consistency conditions. they yield the following

(7.142)

note that in (7.141) and (7.142) we suppose r  2 otherwise the correspond-
ing anomalies are of type i.

for the counterterms, the situation is more complicated. indeed, an

g,q =
0,2r+1 = k[ h]n
an
1 cannot be completed in a brst cocycle. this
implies that for the second cm model there are no counterterms of type ii.
the proof is the following:

2r+1b0

2ra0

we have,

(k[ h]n

2r+1b0

2r b0

 (k[ h]n1

and thus

0,2r = k[ h]n1

2r,

(7.143)

(7.144)

where m2r is a polynomial in the invariants. at order 2r  1 in the
antighost number we then have,

(a2r1  k[ h]n2

2rf = 0.
2r1 = b2r1  k[ h]n2
2r1
0) is an element of h(|d). because 2r  1 > 0 we
2r where u2r1 only depends

acting with  on this equation we see that b
(b1
2r1 = u2r1b0
have up to irrelevant terms b
on the invariants. eq. (7.145) then implies,

1 + b0

2r1a0

(7.145)

2ra1

()n2r1k[ h]n2

2r1f + m2r + du2r1 = 0.

(7.146)

if r > 1, we must have k = 0 because according to theorem 41,
[ h]n2
2r1f denes a non-trivial class of h inv(|d). our statement is
thus proved for r > 1.

if r = 1, eq. (7.146) admits solutions. indeed in form notation,
the action of  on the antields of the 1-form (eq. (7.33)-(7.34)) reads,


1 + df + f rh = 0,
a



1 + f rb
a
1 = 0,
2 + da

(7.147)

(7.148)

7.5 h(s|d) - antield dependent solutions

where  = 2(r+1)
therefore,

(2r+1)! . up to trivial terms, the solutions of (7.146) are

m2r =

()n3ka
2;

u1 =

()n3ka

(7.149)

returning to eq. (7.145) we thus have,

(7.150)

where m1 only depends on the invariants.
it thus appears that for
some chapline-manton models, it is possible to eliminate the rst
obstruction which is met in the construction of brst cocycles. this
is in contrast with the free case where those obstructions cannot be
eliminated without imposing constraints on the arbitrary parameters
present in an

g,q.

however, we now show that for the second cm model, the con-
struction of the counterterm is obstructed at the next step. indeed,
at order 0 in the antighost number we have,

a

0 + db
0

+ k()n3hha0

1 +

1


()n3kf f a0

1 + (m1)a0

1 = 0.

(7.151)

acting with  on this equation and using our results on h(|d) we see
that the obstruction for db
0 to be -exact is of the form p (f ) + du0
where u0 only depends on the invariants. therefore, (7.151) reduces
to,

k()n3hh +

1


()n3kf f + p (f ) + m1 + du0 = 0.

(7.152)

since m1 is linear in the antields of antighost number 1, it can be
written as m1 = aidnx + b12g12dnx where i and g are
functions of the elds strength and their derivatives (terms containing
derivatives of the antields are absorbed in a redenition of u0 in
(7.152)). we thus have the condition,

k()n3hh +

1


()n3kf f + p (f ) + h gdnx

+ (f   h f)idnx + du0 = 0.

(7.153)

142

chapline-manton models

because d is a linear operator which increases by one the number of
derivatives, eq. (7.153) reads at order 2 in the derivatives of the elds
and polynomial degree 2 in the invariants,

k()n3hh +

1


()n3kf f + f f 2 + h ffdnx = 0,

(7.154)

where f and f are constants. to obtain this condition one use the
fact that u0, i and g only depend on the eld strengths and their
derivatives.

if we now take the euler-lagrange derivative of (7.154) with re-
spect to b we reach the conclusion that k = 0 and this proves our
statement.

chapline-manton model 3 for this model, the ghost part of the coho-
mology h() is generated by the improved anticommuting ghost c 0
1b0
2.
in order to construct counterterms we thus need elements of h inv(|d) in
antighost number 3. however, using theorem 42 we conclude that there are
no such elements (the only candidates arise in spacetime dimension n = 5
and are of the form [ g2]6
3 but vanish because g is anticommuting for n = 5.)
to construct an anomaly we need elements of the h inv(|d) in antighost
number 2. again using theorem 42 we see that such terms exist only in
spacetime dimension 6 and are of the form [k g2]6
2. the corresponding anoma-
lies are given by,

3  1

2a0

where cm is dened below (7.116).

1 = k[ g2 cm ]6
an
1,

(7.155)

chapline-manton model 4 according to theorem 35, the j are at least
of pureghost number 5. in order to construct counterterms or anomalies we
therefore need elements of h inv(|d) in antighost number  4. however, the-
orem 43 implies that h inv(|d) vanishes in antighost number > 3. therefore
there are no counterterms or anomalies of type ii for the fourth cm model.

remarks

to summarize, we have shown that one can construct antield dependent
candidate anomalies for the chapline-manton models 2 and 3. however, for
the four models considered, there are no antield dependent brst cocycles
in ghost number 0. this shows that these models are quite rigid because it
is impossible to construct consistent interactions which deform their gauge
transformations.

7.6 conclusions

7.6 conclusions

in this section we have discussed the wess-zumino consistency condition for
chapline-manton models by explicitly analyzing four examples.

the cohomology h(s|d) was worked out but using the same procedure as
for free p-forms. this is possible because the four models considered share
the following properties:

1. the gauge algebra is closed on-shell and therefore the action of the
longitudinal exterior derivative  on the elds and ghosts is nilpotent:
2 = 0;

2. although the action of the brst dierential s on the antields con-
tains components of antighost numbers > 1, it is possible to redene
the antields to eliminate those components. furthermore, the brst
variations of the new antields only involve combinations of the invari-
ant variables (denoted  in the text).

the rst property allows to calculate separately the brst cocycles which
do not depend on the antields. the analysis explicitly shows that the num-
ber of such solutions is reduced compared to the free theory. this is due
to the fact that the cohomologies h() and h inv(d) typically get smaller be-
cause of the emergence of new contractible pairs. in the case of h(), those
contractible pairs consist of ghosts of ghosts while for h(d) they are made
up of curvatures since these obey new bianchi identities.

in the calculation of the antield dependent brst cocycles one observes
the same reduction in the number of solutions. this is a consequence
of the fact that h() contains less elements but also because the invariant
characteristic cohomology h inv(|d) vanishes for more values of the antighost
number.

that the brst cohomology contains less elements for interacting the-
ories than for the free ones is easily understood by considering the follow-
ing argument. let us decompose the brst action of an interacting theory
in powers of the coupling constant, s = s0 + gs1 + g2s2 + . . . and let
a = a0 + ga1 + g2a2 + . . . be a brst cocycle: (s, a) = 0. this condition
implies,

(s0, a0) = 0,
(s0, a1) + (s1, a0) = 0,
(s0, a2) + (s1, a1) + (s2, a0) = 0,

chapline-manton models

the rst equation tells us that a0 is an elements of the cohomology h(s|d) of
the free theory. all the other equations beneath (7.156) are conditions which
the free brst cocycle must satisfy. it is therefore natural that for many of
them the construction of the higher order terms a1, a2, . . . gets obstructed.

chapter 8

comments

in this thesis we have solved the wess-zumino consistency condition for an
arbitrary system of free p-forms but also for models of the chapline-manton
type. using this analysis we have listed for each theory the rst-order ver-
tices, counterterms and anomalies; for the free system we have also discussed
the gauge structure of the conserved currents.

we insist that our calculations were done in the algebra of forms depend-
ing on the components of the antisymmetric tensors, the ghost, the antields
and their derivatives up to an arbitrary high order. however we have shown
that:

1. all the antield independent brst cocycles can be expressed in terms
of exterior products of the elds and the ghost when these solutions oc-
cur in non-trivial descents; this justies why previous calculations made
in the so-called small algebra to obtain counterterms and anomalies
are nearly exhaustive.

2. the natural appearance of exterior forms also holds for antield de-
pendent solutions of the wess-zumino consistency condition. indeed,
except for those related to the conserved currents of the theory, one may
a
assume that the brst cocycles only depend ba

a
pa+1. this is a direct consequence of our analysis of the
b
characteristic cohomology

a

a second feature which deserves to be highlighted is the fact that the
calculation of the local brst cohomology of interacting theories such as
the chapline-manton models is greatly simplied when h(s|d) is known in
the free case. indeed we have seen in chapter 7 how we could obtain the
brst cocycles in the chapline-manton models from those of the free theory
by perturbative arguments. this encourages future works on the brst
