abstract

fractons are anyons classied into equivalence classes and they obey a
specic fractal statistics. the equivalence classes are labeled by a fractal
parameter or hausdor dimension h. we consider this approach in the context
of the fractional quantum hall eect ( fqhe ) and the concept of duality
between such classes, dened by h = 3 h shows us that the lling factors for
which the fqhe were observed just appear into these classes. a connection
between equivalence classes h and the modular group for the quantum phase
transitions of the fqhe is also obtained. a function is dened for a
complex conductivity which embodies the classes h. the thermodynamics is
also considered for a gas of fractons (h, ) with a constant density of states
and an exact equation of state is obtained at low-temperature and low-density
limits. we also prove that the farey sequences for rational numbers can be
expressed in terms of the equivalence classes h.

i. introduction

we obtain from a continuous family of lagrangians for fractional spin particles a path
integral representation for the propagator and its representation in momentum space. in
continuing, we consider the trajectories swept out by scalar and spinning particles which are
characterized by the fractal parameter h ( or the hausdor dimension ). we have that l,
the length of closed trajectory with size r has its fractal properties described by l  rh,
so for scalar particle h = 2 and for spinning particle h = 1. from the form of anyonic
propagator obtained, with the spin dened into the interval 0  s  1
2, we have extracted
that the hausdor dimension h and the spin s of the particle are related by h = 2  2s.
thus, for anyonic particle, h takes values within the interval 1 < h < 2 and the fractional
spin particles or anyonic excitations are classied in terms of equivalence classes labeled by
h. therefore, such particles in a specic class can be considered on equal footing.

on the other hand, in the context of fqhe systems, the lling factor, a parameter which
characterizes that phenomenon, can be classied in this terms too. we have, therefore, a
new hierarchy scheme for the lling factors, which is extracted from the relation between h
and the statistics  ( or the lling factors ). our approach, contrary to literature does not
have an empirical character and we can predict for which values of  fqhe can be observed.
a braid group structure behind this classication is also obtained, such that the anyonic
model, a charge-ux system, constitutes a topological obstruction in this description and
the elements of the braid group are equivalent trajectories.

furthermore, we obtain a fractal statistics ( the distributions have properties of fractal
functions ) for fractional spin particles termed fractons (h, )1 , i.e. anyons classied into
universal class h of particles. as a result, the fermi-dirac and bose-einstein statistics are
generalized naturally. a connection with fqhe is then done and the lling factors observed
for such phenomenon appear into these equivalence classes h. the concept of duality between
equivalence classes introduces the idea of supersymmetry in this context in a manner it looks
like very interesting. this way, we have proved that the constraints that the lling factors
obey for the quantum phase transitions between hall plateaus takes place are satised by
the classes h. thus, we know all possible transitions since we have a fractal spectrum
relating h and , i.e. h classies the universality class of the quantum hall transitions. the
fractal parameter h works in this way as a critical exponent to the correlation lenght and
our theoretical values coincide with the experimental ones. as a consequence, a -function
for a complex conductivity is obtained in terms of h. the termodynamics for a free gas of
fractons (h, ) is obtained at low-temperature and low-density limits for a constant density
of states.

finally, a connection between number theory and hausdor dimension is established from
our considerations about fqhe. the farey sequences of rational numbers can be expressed
in terms of the fractal parameter h. we close this paper with a summary, enphasizing crucial
theoretical points. all necessary background is posed along of our topic expositions.

1be aware, the word fractons was used before in the literature denoting distinct things, see refer-
ences [31] and plyushchay in [20]. in particular, the last one consider anyonic theory, however it
has nothing to do with our denition.

ii. anyonic propagator

there are various actions in the literature [1] for particles with fractional spins, called
anyons, that can be present in nature and explain phenomena such as the fractional quantum
hall eect and high temperature superconductivity [2]. such models have been constructed
in at least two ways: one is coupling to some matter eld a statistical eld of the chern-
simons type that changes the statistics; and the other is the group-theoretical method that
implies a classical mechanical model with a poincare invariant lagrangian which is quantized
[3,4]. we consider a simple action obtained by the latter approach with minimal extension
of the phase space that preserves all canonical structure of the space-time and spin algebra.
thus, we propose a path integral representation for the propagator in a convenient gauge.
in [3], the following continuous family of lagrangians for free anyons was obtained

ls =

1

2e   x 

s q f 


m f. x!2

+

e m2
2 

 m e q

f. x

,

(1)

where m and  are respectively the mass and the helicity of the anyon, and s is an arbitrary
constant deduced from the casimir of the spin algebra, s2 = s2. the functions f satisfy
the non-linear dierential equation

and we obtain the relations

f = f f 

f 2 = 0, f 2 = 1, f . f = 1,

(2)

(3)

with f  = df
s f  = 0, s

 f  = s, s

dq . on the other hand, we have that s =  f + s f 

, so we get, s f  = s,
 f  = . the equation f  qf  = 0 is equivalent to eq.(2) and

f  

 q
q

f   q

f 
q

= 0,

and for f = aq2 + bq + c, we have a = (1, 0,1), b = (1, 1, 1), c = 1
2(1,1, 0). this
way, we extract for q not constant, the condition  q
q = 0. the lagrangian is subject to the
constraint,  (f. x) = e q, and with x = e p +  s, we obtain q =  (f . p) which satises
and gives us that f  . p = 0. then, x . f  =  s and  (f . p) =  m, i.e. s p + m = 0
and x . f = e f  p, and in the gauge  = 0,
e = 0, we have q = m f. x, so  = e m and
p2  m2 = 0.
action, a = r 1

now, we consider the path integral representation for the anyonic propagator with the
0 ls d . in that gauge, we verify that the continuous family of lagrangians

reads

ls =

x2
2e

s2
2e

e

(m2  2m2).

(4)

this way, we propose the path integral representation for the free fractional spin particle

as

where m2 = m2  2m2 and the delta functional takes into account the gauge e = 0. we
dene the measure

(6)

such that, making the substitution

we obtain the new boundary conditions x(0) = 0 = x(1). so, in eq.(5), we have the factor

and s2 > 0 for the causal propagator. this expression was obtained along the same lines as
those used elsewhere for the scalar particle [5]. on the other hand, in momentum space, the
anyonic propagator has the form ( da cruz in [6] )

f(p) =

1

(p  ms)2  m2 .

(9)

iii. hausdorff dimension and anyonic excitations

the trajectories swept out by scalar and spinning particles can be characterized by the
fractal parameter h ( or the hausdor dimension ). we have that l, the length of closed
trajectory with size r has its fractal properties described by l  rh ( see polyakov; kroger
in [6] ), so for scalar particle l  1
p , r1  l
and h = 1. thus, for anyonic particle, h takes values within the interval 1 < h < 2 and the
fractional spin particles or anyonic excitations are classied in terms of equivalence classes

p2 , r2  l and h = 2 ; for spinning particle, l  1

4

labeled by h. from the form of anyonic propagator given in eq.(9), with the spin dened
into the interval 0  s  1
2 , we extract the following formula h = 2  2s, which relates the
hausdor dimension h and the spin s of the particle. this formula can be generalized and
considering ab initio the spin-statistics relation  = 2s, we obtain the fractal spectrum

h  1 = 1  ,
h  1 = 3  ,
h  1 = 5  ,
h  1 = 7  ,
h  1 = 9  ,
etc,

0 <  < 1;
2 <  < 3;
4 <  < 5;
6 <  < 7;
8 <  < 9;

h  1 =   1,
h  1 =   3,
h  1 =   5,
h  1 =   7,
h  1 =   9,

1 <  < 2;
3 <  < 4;
5 <  < 6;
7 <  < 8;
9 <  < 10;

(10)

and so, we have a mirror symmetry for all spectrum of .

iv. hausdorff dimension and filling factors

we can establish a connection between the fractal parameter h and the lling factor ,
a parameter that appears in the context of the fqhe and for them we have experimental
values [7]. this connection can be done once the anyonic model has been considered to
explain that phenomenon [8].

the fqhe is associated with a planar charged system in a perpendicular magnetic eld
and as a result a new type of correlated ground state occurs. the hall resistance develops
plateaus at quantized values in the vicinity of the lling factor or statistics , which is related
to the fraction of electrons that forms collective excitations as quasiholes or quasiparticles.
excitations above the laughlin ground state are characterized, therefore, by  and so we
propose a new hierarchy scheme for the fqhe which gives us the possibility of predicting for
which values of  fqhe can be observed ( see below, section vi.a, the concept of duality
between equivalence classes ).

our scheme is based on the intervals of denition of spin s, for fractional spin particles
which are related to the hausdor dimension h. we verify that for some experimental
values of  for which the fqhe were observed the hausdor dimension is a rational number
with an odd denominator ( like the lling factor ). thus, bearing in mind the condition,
1 < h < 2, we can determine for which values of h, the statistics takes a specic value in
eq.(10). for example, this hierarchy scheme gives us for some experimental values of  the
respective values of h,

(h , 0 <  < 1) :

we can see another interesting point from these pairs of numbers: some collective excitations
with dierent spins have the same value of h, i.e. the nature of the occurrence of fqhe for
that values of  can be classied in terms of h, so we can say that this number classies the
collective excitations in terms of its homotopy class [8].

v. filling factors and braid group

as we pointed out the hausdor dimension h, can be considered as a parameter which
classies the equivalence classes of the collective excitations which occurs in the context of
the fqhe. the elements of each equivalence class are the lling factors or statistics , which
characterize the collective excitations manifested as quasiholes or quasiparticles. now, we
propose rules of composition for these elements and we extract a braid group structure from
this new hierarchy scheme for the lling factors.

we know that for path integration on multiply connected spaces [9], we need to assign
dierent weights , to homotopically disconnected paths. so, in terms of our scheme, as
we just said, hi ( i means a specic interval ), labels these classes, which form a group, the
fundamental group 1(p), with elements  = exp {}. we also have that, for the abelian
representation of the group, the weights satisfy the constraints [9]

|{i}hi | = 1,
{i}hi
{j}hj

= {i  j}hij

.

(14)

the weights  represent a phase which we assign to the paths that contribute to the prop-
agator

k(q, t; q, t) = x{}h

{}h k{}h(q, t; q, t).

(15)

we observe that, for the composition law, for example, with 1 + 2, we do not consider
integers since  can only be a rational number with odd denominator ( see again the intervals
of  ). on the other hand, we verify that some compositions with elements of the same class
give another element either in or out of the class and the same occurs for the distinct classes.
but this does not matter, because we only consider paths within the same class for the path
integration. for example, consider the classes

vi. fractal statistics

in the literature, the fractional spin particles are a subject of attention by now for a long
date. anyons [10] are kinds of particles, that live in two dimensions, where wavefunctions ac-
quire an arbitrary phase when two of them are braided. a fractional exclusion statistics was
proposed in [11] for arbitrary dimensions, which interpolates between bosonic and fermionic
statistics. in [12] was showed that anyons also satisfy an exclusion principle when haldane
statistics are generalised to innite dimensional hilbert spaces. the statistics parameter g
was introduced for particles with nite dimensional hilbert spaces and dened as g =  d
n ,
and if we add n particles into the system, the number of single-particles states d available
for further particles is altered by d. this expresses a reduction of single-particle hilbert
space by the exclusion statistics parameter g. in [13] a distribution function for particles
obeying a generalised exclusion principle was introduced, and the statistical mechanics and
thermodynamics considered. also in [14], some physical properties considering exclusion
statistics for identical particles called g-ons was obtained.

on the other hand, in the context of fractional quantum hall eect wavefunctions were
obtained for the lowest landau level ( lll) [15] and fqhe quasiparticles as anyons conned
in the lll were discussed in terms of exclusion statistics in [16].

in this paper, we propose another way to consider anyons. as we have pointed out above
they can be classied in terms of a fractal parameter or hausdor dimension h, and so these
particles appear into the equivalence classes labeled by h. contrary to literature [13] we show
that dierent particles with distinct values of fractional spin s within the equivalence class h
satisfy a specic fractal statistics. this constitutes in some sense a more suitable approach to
fractional spin particles, since unify them naturally. a connection with fqhe systems can
be done, and the lling factors for which fqhe were observed just appear into these classes
and the ocurrence of fqhe are considered in terms of duality between equivalence classes.
a supersymmetric character between fermions and bosons ( dual objects by denition ) in
the extremes of the range of h is a special result advanced by this formulation.

the manifest symmetry of the relation between h and  ( see eq.(10) ) and the ways
of distributing nj identical particles among gj states, besides the constraints given by the
extremes of the interval of denition of h, i.e. h = 2 for bosons and h = 1 for fermions or in
another way how distributing fermions and bosons bring us to propose a statistical weight
for the anyonic excitations in terms of h, as follows:

j =

[gj + (nj  1)(h  1)]!

nj! [gj + (nj  1)(h  1)  nj]!

.

(17)

for 1 < h < 2, we have anyonic excitations which interpolates between these two extremes.
consider now the classes h = 5
and

3 , 7

3 , 11

3 , 13

3 , 17

3 and h = 4

3, then we obtain n 1

3, 10

3, 8
these particles or excitations, in the class, share some common characteristics, according
to our interpretation, in the same way that bosons and fermions. we observe again that
each interval contributes with one and only one particle to the class and the statistics and
the spin, are related by  = 2s.

3

7

we stress that, our expression for statistical weight eq.(17), is more general than an
expression given in [13], once if we consider the relation between h and , we just obtain
that rst result and extend it for the complete spectrum of statistics , for example:

[gj + (nj  1)(1  )]!

nj! [gj + (nj  1)(1  )  nj]!

[gj + (nj  1)(  1)]!

nj! [gj + (nj  1)(  1)  nj]!

[gj + (nj  1)(3  )]!

nj! [gj + (nj  1)(3  )  nj]!

[gj + (nj  1)(  3)]!

nj! [gj + (nj  1)(  3)  nj]!

j =

j =

j =

etc.

,

,

,

,

0 <  < 1;

1 <  < 2;

2 <  < 3;

3 <  < 4;

(18)

the expressions eq.(18) were possible because of the mirror symmetry in eq.(10). but,
our approach in terms of hausdor dimension h, have an advantage, because we collect into
equivalence class the anyonic excitations and so, we consider on equal footing the excitations
in the class. we have, therefore, a new approach for fractional spin particles. for dierent
species of particles, the statistical weight take the form

 = yj

j = yj

[gj + (nj  1)(h  1)]!

nj! [gj + (nj  1)(h  1)  nj]!

,

(19)

which reduces to eq.(17) for only one species. now, we can consider the entropy for a given
class h. taking the logarithm of eq.(19), with the condition that, nj and gj are vary large
numbers and dening the average occupation numbers, nj = nj
, we obtain for a gas not in
gj
equilibrium, an expression for the entropy

s = xj
 nj ln 

gj([1 + nj(h  1)] ln  1 + nj(h  1)
1 + nj(h  1)  nj!) ,

1 + nj(h  1)  nj!

nj

(20)

and for h = 2 and h = 1, we obtain the expressions for a bose and fermi gases not in
equilibrium [17],

s = xj
s = xj

gj {(1 + nj) ln (1 + nj)  nj ln nj} ;

gj {nj ln nj + (1  nj) ln (1  nj)} ,

(21)

(22)

respectively.

the distribution function for a gas of the class h can be obtained from the condition of

the entropy be a maximum. thus, we have

nj = {1 + nj(h  1)}h1 {1 + nj(h  2)}2h

(23)

8

or

nj =

1

y[]  h

,

where the function y[] satises

 = {y[]  1}h1 {y[]  2}2h ,

(24)

(25)

and  = exp {(j  )/kt}, has the usual denition. the bose and fermi distributions are
obtained for values of h = 2, 1 respectively. at this point, we observe that the condition of
periodicity on the statistics , in our approach, is expressed as

nj() = nj( + 2),

(26)

and the equivalence classes h always respect this condition naturally. on the other hand,
this also means that, as  = 2s, particles with distinct values of spin s into the class h obey
a specic fractal statistics eq.(24).2 if the temperature is suciently low and j < , we can
check that the mean ocuppation number is given by n = 1
2h , and so the fractal parameter
h regulates the number of particles in each quantum state, i.e. for h = 1, n = 1; h = 2, n =
; h = 3
2h if j < f , hence
we get a step distribution, taking into account the fermi energy f and h 6= 2.

2, n = 2; etc. at t = 0 and j > , n = 0 if j > f and n = 1

a. fractional quantum hall eect

in the context of the fractional quantum hall eect, as we have pointed out above,
the lling factor ( rational number with an odd denominator ), can be also classied in
terms of h. we have that the anyonic excitations are collective excitations manifested as
quasiparticles or quasiholes in fqhe systems. thus, for example, we have the collective
excitations as given in the beginning for h = 5
3 and h = 4
3 . now, we have noted that these
collections contain lling fractions, in particular,  = 1
3 and  = 2
3, that experimentally
were observed [7] and so we are able to estimate for which values of  the largest charge
gaps occurs, or alternatively, we can predict fqhe. as was observed before this is a new
hierarchy scheme for the lling factors, that expresses the occurrence of the fqhe
in more fundamental terms, i.e. relating the fractal parameter h and the lling
factors 3. of course, in our approach we do not have empirical expressions like this one
[18],  = n
2pn1, for the experimental occurrence of fqhe. after all, for anyonic excitations
in a stronger magnetic eld at low temperature, our results eq.(18) obtained via an approach
completely distinct of [13] can be considered.

in another way, we introduce the concept of duality between equivalence classes, dened

by

2 we observe here that these distributions just as dened are fractal functions which satisfy the
necessary conditions as discussed, for example, by rocco and west in [6].

3the quantum number  gets its topological character from h.

9

h = 3  h,

(27)

such that for h = 1, h = 2 and for h = 2, h = 1, so fermions and bosons are dual objects.
this means that they can be considered supersymmetric particles4.

for a set of values of the lling factors  experimentally observed [7], according to our

relations (eqs.(27) and (10)), we get the classes, h and h:

we emphasize that in each class, some lling factors are just the experimental values ob-
served, i.e. the hall resistance develops plateaus in these quantized values, which are related
to the fraction of electrons that form collective excitations as quasiholes or quasiparticles in
fqhe systems. the relation of duality between equivalence classes labeled by h can, there-
fore, indicates a way as determine the dual of a specic value of  ( or  ) observed. note
also that the class {1, 3, 5, 7,  }h=1 gives us the odd lling factors for the integer quantum
hall eect. an interpretation of the fractal parameter h as some kind of order parameter
which characterizes the ocurrence of fqhe is enough attractive. we can say that the con-
cept of duality connects a quasi-bosonic regime h  2 to a quasi-fermionic regime h  1, as
(h, ) = ( 5
3). this observation overlapping with some ideas in the literature for
considering supersymmetric anyon theories in condensed matter systems [20]. as a check
2(cid:17) pointed out

we can verify that the supersymmetric pairs for energy states of spin (cid:16)s, s  1

4there are in the literature dierent formulations relating duality and fqhe [19].

by spector, and witten5 [20] have a realization through duality concept introduced here6 .
therefore, the fqhe is a natural scenario for fractal supersymmetry to be explored ( see
traubenberg and spulinski, and more in [20] ).

another view is the relation l  rh, which shows us a scaling law behind this character-
ization of the fqhe [6]. we also observe that our approach, in terms of equivalence classes
for the lling factors, embodies the structure of the modular group as discussed in [19,21].
for that, we consider the sequences given by dolan [21] as

,

(h, ) = (cid:18) 5
(h, ) = (cid:18) 19
(h, ) = (cid:18) 4

and we can verify that the other sequences follow according h increases or decreases within
the interval 1 < h < 2, respecting  entries in each class. the transitions allowed are
those generated by the condition | p2q1  p1q2 |= 1, with h1 = p1
. thus our
formulation satises in the same way the constraints given for the lling factors  [21].

and h2 = p2
q2

q1

we have that the transition between two hall plateaus is a quantum phase transition
generated by quantum uctuations when the external magnetic eld is varied, thus we have
a correlation length ( remember l  rh ) given by
| l  lc |h ,

 

(30)

1

where l is the magnetic length which depends on magnetic eld and temperature7. we take
h = 2, because we consider the hall uid as a bosonic uid8in according to diverse eld-
theoretical models in the literature for fqhe [19] and better, experimentally the exponent
of l = l  lc is equal to 2.02. also the dimensionless parameter u = n e h
( h = h1  h2,
n is the density of particles with charge e ) can be used to describe the crossover between two
hall plateaus , with the critical exponent  = 1
h = 0.5 ( assumed universal ), in according to
the experimental value 0.45  0.05 [23]. on the other hand, an analysis by dolan, consider

t 

5 here, in particular, we are suggesting a connection with fractal superstrings, see tye in [20].

6for another discussion about deformed lie algebras and anyonic supersymmetry, where systems
of two states have spins shifted in one-half, see plyushchay in [20].

7the idea of the hausdor dimension as a critical exponent was discussed earlier in another
context [22].

8 observe that the experimental values of the lling factors most remarkable are just those into
the classes h between the bosonic line , h = 2 and the self-dual line, h = 3
2 .

11

the critical exponent h = 2 convenient for considerations about analiticity of the -function,
so the renormalization group parameter u in this case would be inversely proportional to
the correlation length. thus, we can theoretically justify the experimental regularity of the
transverse component of the conductivity at the critical point [21].

the possible dierences between the theoretical and experimental values for the critical
exponents can be related with the disorder phenomenon and the electron-electron interac-
tions, so we can consider some corrections for them. this way, we dene function which
describes just the crossover between two hall plateaus as a complex analytic function of the
complex conductivity

() =

d 
d v

,

(31)

where  is the complex conductivity and v is a real analytic monotonic function of u.

following dolan [21], we can dene

(h) =

p2q2 {k (w)}2 + p1q1 {k(w)}2 + k (w)k(w)

1 {k(w)}2 + q2
q2

2 {k (w)}2

,

(32)

where k (w) and k(w) are complete elliptic integrals of the second kind, with

w2 =

,

(33)

1

2 
1 + sign(h)r1  e( ah


(h)t  )2


with the complementary modulus w dened as w2 = 1  w2, k (w) = k(w) and
 = 1
h = 0.5 ( hall uid is bosonic ), a is a positive real constant ( which can de-
pend on electron and impurity density, or other parameters ) and the linear function
(h) =  {(q1  q2)h + },  = p2  p1  (q2  q1)hc and hc = h2 is the class of the
lling factor c = 2 at the critical value of the magnetic eld.
now, in another way, we give more arguments in favour of our approach. we have that
for excitations above the laughlin ground state, the exchange of two quasiholes [8] with
coordinates z and z produces the condition on the phase

exp{1} = exp(cid:26)

1

m(cid:27) ,

(34)

1

with 1= 1
m +2p1; and for a second generation of quasihole excitations, the eective wavefunc-
tion carries the factor (z  z)2, with 2= 1
+ 2p2; m = 3, 5, 7,   and p1, p2 are positive
integers. we observe that these conditions over the lling factor  conrm our classication
of the collective excitations in terms of h. another interesting point is that in each class,
we have more lling factors which those generates by eq.(34), i.e. our classication covers
a more complete spectrum of states. now, we can see that the duality between equivalence
classes also means duality between quasiholes and quasiparticles. there are internal and
external dualities. this means that for charges q = e, we have an internal duality in
each equivalence class h or h. external duality stands for dual classes, h and h. therefore,
h tells us about the nature of the anyonic excitations.

on one hand, we note that the anyonic exchanges of dual get a phase dierence, modulo

constant,

12

|  | = || = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

h  h(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= const,

(35)

suggesting an invariance, conformal symmetry. we also have for the elements of h and h,
the following relations

i+1  i
j+1  j
j+1  j
i+1  i

= 1;

= 1,

(36)

with i = 1, 3, 5, etc. and j = 2, 4, 6, etc.; plus the pairs (i, j) = (1, 2) , (3, 4) , etc. satisfy the
expressions in eq.(36).

vii. thermodynamics for fractal statistics

the thermodynamics for fractal statistics is now considered and a free gas of anyons are
termed fractons (h, ). in particular, at low temperature and in the low density, for a gas
with a constant density of states in energy, equations of state for such systems are obtained
, we obtain the

n =

(37)

and we observe that this expression was just obtained in the literature for the statistics
parameter g = 1
2 [13], but according to our approach it is valid for all values of  within
the class h = 3
2.
it is noteworthy that for some of these special values of  ( with even
denominators ) fqhe were observed [24].

the thermodynamic properties for a given class h can be now obtained. in two dimen-

sions, the particle number in a volume element d2p dv in phase space is given by

dn = g

d2p dv

with g =  + 1 and  = 2s. integrating over v (area), we obtain

2, 1
from the eq.(25) we see that the function y() get its degree from h denominator and so
for calculate the roots of y in terms of the parameter  can be a formidable mathematical
task. otherwise, we can solve y() numerically. for example, the classes h = 4
3 have a
third degree algebraic equation

which has real solution ( cardano formula )

and the thermodynamic properties for the fractons (h, ) = (cid:16) 4
3, 1
3, 2

however, we can follow another way. the distribution function can be written in terms of
the single-state grand partition function j, as

nj = j

 ln j

j

,

where j = yj 2

yj 1. thus, we can expand j in powers of j,

j = yj  2
yj  1
vl l

and

where

nj =

vl =

yk=2(1 + (h  2)

yk=1(1 + (h  2)

l

k) .

these coecients are obtained in the same way as discussed in [25]. they do not depend
on g states number and are calculated from the combinatorial formula

w =

g [g + (h  1)n  1]!
n! [g + (h  2)n]!

,

15

(55)

taking into account the grand partition function



z(g, ) =

w(g, n) n

xn =0
=  xl

vl l!g

,

(56)

as g-th power of the single-state partition function .

the eq.(55) gives the same statistical mechanics as that introduced earlier in eq.(17).
now, we can consider at low temperature sommerfeld expansions [26]. this way, we handle
integrals of the type

j [f ] = kt z 

1

dy

(y  1) (y  2)

and after expansion we have

f ( + kt "h ln(cid:26)y  1

we can obtain now some thermodynamic quantities. let us consider, the dispersion as

for a dilute gas or high-temperature regime, we can investigate the thermodynamic
properties of a free gas using virial expansion. the equation of state relates p , t and  (
pressure, temperature and density respectively ) as follows [27]

p =  k t n1 + a2 + a22 +   o ,

(67)

where a2,a3, etc are the virial cocients. the grand potential is the sum over the single-
particle states

as a consequence, the specic heat depends on h and .

viii. farey sequences and hausdorff dimension

from our considerations about fractional quantum hall eect we can show now a
connection between the fractal parameter h and the farey series for rational numbers [28].
thus, we have the following theorem:

the elements of the farey series belong to distinct equivalence classes labeled by a fractal
parameter h dened into the interval 1 < h < 2, and these classes satisfy the same properties
observed for those fractions. also, for each value of h there exists an algebraic equation .

as we have pointed out above the fractal parameter h is related to  ( an irreducible
q , with p and q integers, see eq.(10) ) and we can extract, for example, the classes

where the  sequence is the farey series of order 6. thus, we observe that because of
the fractal spectrum in eq.(10), we can write down any farey series of rational numbers.
therefore, in this way, we established a beautiful connection between number theory and
physics. we have shown that the farey series can be arranged into equivalence classes
labeled by a fractal parameter h which looks like a hausdor dimension. for each value of h
we have an algebraic equation derived of the eq.(25). then, there exists a relation between
algebraic equation and farey series. the connection between a geometric parameter related
to the paths of particles and rational numbers is for itself an interesting result.

ix. summary and discussion

in summary, we have obtained a path integral representation for the propagator of free
anyons eq.(8) and its representation in momentum space eq.(9) taking into account a contin-
uous family of lagrangians eq.(4). these ones were obtained by a group-theoretical approach
with minimal extension that preserves all canonical structure of the space-time and spin al-
gebra [3]. to obtain the propagator, a convenient gauge =0, e=0 was considered. we have
furthermore obtained distribution functions eq.(24) for anyonic excitations in terms of the
hausdor dimension h, which classies the anyonic excitations into equivalence classes ( or
universal classes of particles, because we have fractons (h, )) and reduces to fermionic and
bosonic distributions, when h = 1 and h = 2, respectively. this constitutes a new approach
for such systems of fractional spin particles. this way, we have extended eq.(18) results of
the literature [13] for the complete spectrum of statistics .

a connection with the fqhe, considering the lling factors into equivalence classes
labeled by h was also considered and an estimate for occurrence of fqhe made. a relation

19

between equivalence classes h and the modular group for the quantum phase transitions (
meaning that h classies the universality class of these transitions ) of the fqhe was also
noted. a function is written down [21] which embodies the classes h and the concept of
duality between equivalence classes conrms that all this works.
we have also considered a free gas of fractons (h, ) and an exact equation of state was
obtained at low-temperature and low-density limits.
in particular, for a gas in the low-
density regime the equation of state shows us only interaction between pairs of group of two
clusters of fractons (h, ). a connection between farey sequences and hausdor dimension
have been proven. we have shown that the idea of supersymmetry appears naturally in
solid state physics, throughout our approach to fqhe [20]. this was possible with the
introduction of the concept of duality between equivalence classes dened by h  1 = 2  h
or h  1 = 2  h. these coecients take part in eq.(25) as exponents. it is worth noting
that the fractal parameter h can be any number within the interval of denition and so we
have other possibilities for the spin values to the particles in two space dimension. another
important theoretical point is that we considered ab initio the spin-statistics relation  = 2s.
observe that our results are supported by the symmetries which pervade all the formulation
propose by us.

now, a note of caution: the lling factor is dened by f = n 0

 ( where n is the
number of electrons, 0 is the quantum unit of magnetic ux and  is the external magnetic
ux through the sample material ) and the spin-statistics relation is given by  = 2s =
2 
( where  is the magnetic ux associated to the charge-ux system ). according
0
to our approach there is a correspondence between f and , numerically f = . thus,
the quantum hall states with f taking odd, even integer and rational values would be
described, respectively by fermions (h = 1), bosons (h = 2) and fractons (1 < h < 2)9. this
way, we have a more general setting for particles or quasiparticles termed fractons (h, ),
with 1  h  2. as a result, we get some information about the microscopic nature of both
phenomena: the integer and fractional quantum hall eect. another interesting conceptual
possibility is the pairing of fractons (h, ), resulting in fermions, bosons or fractons. a target
of these ideas can be, for example, the high-tc superconductivity.

finally, we would like to emphasize that in our approach to fractional spin particles we do
not have any statistical interaction matrix which describes correlation eects among particles
according to the generalized pauli exclusion principle by haldane [11]. however, as we have
seen the fractal parameter h gives us distributions which coincide with haldane analysis, but
contrary to him and previous authors [1214,29] our interpretation is that such distributions
are valid for all particles in a specic class h. in this way, we generalize the fermi-dirac and
bose-einstein statistics, taking into account a unique expression eq.(24) for each universal
class h of particles. this is the dierence. from a mathematical viewpoint we have also
discovered all a class of fractal functions, i.e.
just our fractal statistics ( see rocco and
west in [6] ). this one captures the observation that the path of a quantum-mechanical
particle is continuous and nondierentiable, i.e. a fractal curve. hence, our formulation
can be understood as a quantum-geometrical description of the statiscal laws of nature. it
is noteworthy that this result is a physical realization of mathematical ideas about fractal

9keep in mind the dual character of our approach, h = 3  h.

geometry. an extension of this abelian fractal statistics to nonabelian fractal statistics, the
case for the higher dimensional irreducible unitary representations of the braid group is a
matter of future work. also the study of some connection between eective conformal eld
theories for quasiparticles and these statistics deserves attention [30]. much of the results
of this paper appeared in a series of unpublished works by the author.
