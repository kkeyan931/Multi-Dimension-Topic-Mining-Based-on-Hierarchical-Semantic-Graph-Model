(18) ref. ) support realization virasoro algebra (the asymptotic symmetries 2d ads space). problem peculiarity 2d case shows also higher dimensions . solve problem proposed dene new, time-integrated, generators j (eq. (22) ref. ). moreover, able show dirac bracket algebra charges j gives central extension virasoro algebra calculate central charge. compute central charge algebra used equation: dj = j + c(, ), (1) hat meaning overall time-integration. park yee claim left-hand side eq. (1) written { j, j }db, (2) thus invalidating result charges j span representation virasoro algebra. demonstration park yee relies two assumptions need gener- alized one wants interpret consistently time-integrated charges j generators algebra. first, generators asymptotic symmetry longer identied phase space functionals h ( eq. (17) ref. ), rather time-integrated ones h. second, usual denition poisson brackets, brackets evaluated equal times, generalized order allow general brackets { h, h}p b, (3) h time-integrated functional. generalization objects canonical formalism implicitly contained denition charges j . moreover needed order recognize eq. (1) canonical realization asymptotic symmetries. know framework charges j sensible interpre- tation noether charges. irrelevant purposes since looking canonical realization asymptotic symmetries allows us perform computation central charge algebra. using previously dened generalized notions canonical generators poisson brackets easily prove left-hand side eq. (1) written dirac bracket algebra. one needs compute explicitly brackets { h, h}p b. one nds : { h, h} = h + c(, ) central charge exactly value found ref. . fixing gauge constraints hold strongly using eq. (17) ref. , previous equation implies { j, j}db = j + c(, ). (4) (5) 1 comparing equation eq. (1), follows immediately left-hand side latter written dirac bracket eq. (2). let us show explicitly calculations used ref. {$9910213$} park yee support claim inconsistent denitions generators poisson brackets. equation (4) follows immediately canonical generators virasoro algebra functionals h rather h. therefore eq. (6) ref. {$9910213$}, starting point demonstration park yee, apply. right equation used instead: {j, h}db = {j, j}db = j. (6) following yee park perform time integration eq. (6). left-hand side becomes 2 z 2 0 dt{j, j}db = { j, j}db, (7) follows immediately left-hand side eq. (1) written dirac bracket.
