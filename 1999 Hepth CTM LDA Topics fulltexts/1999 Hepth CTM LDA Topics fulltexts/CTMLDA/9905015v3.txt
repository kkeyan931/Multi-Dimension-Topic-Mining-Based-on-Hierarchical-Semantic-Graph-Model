abstract

we examine supersymmetric su(n) gauge theories on r3  s1 with a circle of circumfer-
ence . these theories interpolate between four-dimensional n = 1 pure gauge theory for
 =  and three-dimensional n = 2 gauge theory for  = 0. the dominant eld congu-
rations of the r3  s1 su(n) theories in the semi-classical regime arise from n varieties of
monopole. periodic instanton congurations correspond to mixed congurations of n single

monopoles of the n dierent types. we semi-classically evaluate the non-perturbatively gen-
erated superpotential of the r3  s1 theory and hence determine its vacuum structure. we
then calculate monopole contributions to the gluino condensate in these theories and take
the decompactication limit  = . in this way we obtain a value for the gluino conden-
sate in the four-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills theory, which agrees
with the previously known weak coupling expression but not with the strong coupling

expression derived in the early literature solely from instanton considerations. moreover, we

discover that the superpotential gives a mass to the dual (magnetic) photon, which implies

connement of the original electric photon and disappearance of all the massless modes.

i

introduction

the main goal of this paper is to provide a new calculation of the value of the gluino conden-
sate in four-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric pure su(n) gauge theory. our approach
incorporates recent results and ideas of refs. [17]. previous to this, two conceptually dier-
ent approaches for calculating (cid:10) tr2

162(cid:11) have been followed in the literature:

1. in the rst methodology [810], the so-called strong-coupling instanton (sci) approach,

the gluino condensate (cid:10) tr2
explicit one-instanton calculation of (cid:10) tr2(x1)
are then invoked in order to extract (cid:10) tr2
162(cid:11).

162

162(cid:11) is determined directly in the strongly coupled theory using an
162 (cid:11). cluster decomposition arguments

   tr2(xn )

2. in the second methodology [11], the so-called weak-coupling instanton (wci) approach,

the calculation is performed with additional matter elds whose presence ensures that the

theory is weakly coupled and a semi-classical constrained instanton calculation is justied

[12]. holomorphicity of supersymmetric f-terms is then used to decouple the matter elds
and to ow to the original pure n = 1 gauge theory.

as reviewed in [1], these two methods give two dierent values for the gluino condensate

[10, 11, 13, 14]:

(cid:28) tr2
162(cid:29)sci
(cid:28) tr2
162(cid:29)wci

(1.1a)

(1.1b)

these results are quoted in the pauli-villars scheme with  being the corresponding dimen-

sional transmutation scale of the theory. the reason for the discrepancy between the sci

versus wci calculations, as well as the question as to which is correct, has been a long-

standing controversy [10, 11, 15, 16]. the new ingredient in this old puzzle is the fact that

over the last few years multi -instanton technology has been developed [1721] to the extent

that calculations can be performed in supersymmetric (and in principle non-supersymmetric)

gauge theories, both in the weak-coupling [17] and in the strong-coupling regimes [21], pro-

viding us with successful quantitative tests of, respectively, the seiberg-witten solution of
n = 2 theories [22] and the maldacena duality [23] in the n = 4 theory.
examined the gluino condensate controversy using these recently developed methods.

in [1] we re-

in

particular, we evaluated the large n contribution of k instantons to gluino correlation func-

tions and demonstrated conclusively that an essential technical step in the sci calculation

of the gluino condensate, namely the use of cluster decomposition, is actually invalid.

2

the central idea pursued in the present paper is that there are additional congurations

which contribute to gluino condensate in the strongly-coupled regime, implying that the

instanton-induced sci expression (1.1a) is incomplete. the existence of other contributions

necessarily aects the application of cluster decomposition in the following sense. since each

single instanton has 2n adjoint fermion zero-modes the k-instanton conguration contributes

to the correlation function

(cid:28)tr2(x1)

162

tr2(xkn )

162 (cid:29) ,

  

(1.2)

rather than directly to (cid:10) tr2
applying cluster decomposition to (1.2) with the additional assumption that the instanton
calculation averages over the n physically equivalent vacua of the n = 1 theory.
following, we will show that the correlator (1.2) is not dominated solely by instantons and

162(cid:11) itself. in the sci approach gluino condensate is obtained by

in the

hence the clustering argument must be applied to the complete expression and not just to

the instanton contribution. this is of course in complete agreement with our earlier observa-

tion [1] that clustering fails when only multi-instantons are included in the sci calculation.
furthermore, when the theory is partially compactied on r3s1, we will identify the cong-
urations contributing directly to (cid:10) tr2
162(cid:11) with monopoles. by considering the contribution of

the monopole congurations, we will be able to argue that the complete strong coupling ex-

pression for gluino condensate is dierent from the sci expression (1.1a) but agrees perfectly

with the wci result (1.1b).

it has been suspected for a long time [2427] that in the strongly coupled theories, such

as qcd or its supersymmetric brethren, instantons should be thought of as composite states

of more basic congurations, loosely referred to as instanton partons. these partons would

give important and possibly dominant contributions to the non-perturbative dynamics at

strong coupling. our intention is to make this idea more precise. a necessary evil in our
approach is to consider the theory with one of its dimensions compactied.1 to this end, we
suppose that, say, x4, is periodic with period /2.2 we must then impose periodic boundary
conditions for bosons and fermions

am(x, x4 = 0) = am(x, x4 = ) ,

(x, x4 = 0) = (x, x4 = ) ,

(1.3)

1our approach is dierent from the toron calculations of ref. [28] where all four dimensions were compact-
ied on a torus. the advantage of our method compared to that of [28] is that we do not have to ne-tune the
compactication parameters for the nite-action congurations to exist. we also note that the value gluino
condensate extracted from the toron approach of [28] in the nite-volume torus with the ne-tuned periods
is dicult to interpret in the innite volume and its numerical value agrees neither with the wci (1.1b) nor
with the sci (1.1a) results. in the alternative toron set-up advocated in [29], the ne-tuning problem was
avoided at the cost of introducing singular toron-like congurations with a branch cut and an ir regulator.
2the indices run over m = 1, 2, 3, 4 and  = 1, 2, 3. our other conventions in four and three non-compact

dimensions as well as instanton and monopole basics follow closely appendices a and c of ref. [30].

3

to preserve supersymmetry. an important additional ingredient, as explained in sec. ii of [31],

is that the local gauge group itself must also be composed of proper gauge transformations,
i.e. those that are periodic on s1:

u(x, x4 = 0) = u(x, x4 = ) .

(1.4)

we will refer to the aforementioned theory as the theory on the cylinder r3  s1 to
distinguish it from the nite temperature compactication where the fermions have anti-

periodic boundary conditions. the situation we envisage is similar to that discussed in [32],
since the theory on r3  s1 interpolates between the four-dimensional n = 1 pure gauge
theory, for  = , and a three-dimensional n = 2 gauge theory, for  = 0. from now on we
will work at nite  and only at the end of the calculation take the limit of    in order
to recover the genuinely four-dimensional theory.

some time ago, gross, pisarski and yae [31] gave a complete topological classication
of the smooth nite-action gauge elds on r3  s1 which may contribute to the path integral
in the semi-classical approximation. the relevant congurations are characterized by three

sets of invariants: the instanton number k, the magnetic charge q, and the eigenvalues of the

asymptotics of the wilson line:

 = p exp z 

0

dx4 a4(x4, x  ) .

(1.5)

one consequence of this classication is that at nite radius  instanton congurations do not

exhaust the set of semi-classical contributions because congurations with magnetic charges

canand in fact docontribute to the non-perturbative dynamics including the value of the

gluino condensate. ref. [31] further argued that in the nite temperature compactication

not the one under present considerationthe non-trivial values of the asymptotic wilson line

(1.5) are suppressed in the innite volume limit. consequently, the classically at directions

ha4i = diag(a1, a2, . . . , an )

(1.6)

are lifted by thermal quantum corrections and the true vacuum of the theory is ha4i = 0.
in this case the congurations with magnetic charges are not relevant and the semi-classical

physics involves instantons only. remarkably, for the theory on the cylinder, with periodic

boundary conditions on the fermions, the argument of [31] does not apply and, as we shall

see, the opposite scenario ensues:

(i) the semi-classical physics of the r3  s1 su(n) theory is described by congurations

of monopoles of n dierent types.

4

(ii) the classical moduli space of the r3  s1 su(n) theory (1.6) is lifted in a non-trivial

way

leaving behind n supersymmetry-preserving vacua labelled by the n discrete values of the
-angle3

u = 2(u  1) ,

u = 1, 2, . . . , n .

(1.8)

the n vacua are related to each other by the chiral subgroup zn , which permutes us, but
leaves the wilson line (1.7) unchanged. each such vacuum contributes a factor of 1 to the
witten index tr(1)f = n [33]. the values of gluino condensate in each of these vacua will
be related to each other by a trivial phase transformation exp[iu/n]. from now on we will
concentrate on simply one of the vacua, with u = 0. the distinctive feature of (1.7) is the
constant equal spacing between the vevs aj:

aj  aj+1 =

,

j = 1, 2, . . . , n .

(1.9)

in general, one would think that the eld congurations of the r3  s1 theory which
are relevant in the semi-classical regime are both instantons and monopoles. remarkably,

however, the instanton congurations are themselves included as specic multi-monopole

congurations. this happens in the following way: rst of all, an instanton conguration on
the cylinder follows from a standard instanton conguration in r4 [34] by imposing periodic
boundary conditions in x4 (1.3).
in addition we need instanton solutions in the presence
of a non-vanishing vev for the gauge eld component a4, or equivalently a non-trivial
expectation of the wilson line, as in eqs. (1.5) and (1.6). such periodic instantons in the
presence of a wilson line were recently analyzed in refs. [27].4 it transpires that instantons
on the cylinder can be understood as composite congurations of n single monopoles, one
of each of the n dierent types [27, 36, 37]. one expects in an su(n) theory on r4 that
the lowest charged, or fundamental, monopoles come in n  1 dierent varieties, carrying
a unit of magnetic charge from each of the u(1) factors of the u(1)n 1 gauge group left
unbroken by the vev. the additional monopole, needed to make up the n types, is specic

to the compactication on the cylinder [25] and will be called here a kk-monpole. the new

3in general, the f f term in the microscopic lagrangian can be rotated away with an anomalous
chiral transformation of gluinos. however  is an angular variable in the sense that  = 2n, n  z, is
indistinguishable from  = 0. we will demonstrate in the following that the topological charge q of the
congurations contributing to the gluino condensate is q = 1/n and thus the net eect of the f f term
in each vacuum is the phase factor u/n .

4for the simpler case of ha4i = 0 periodic instantons were previously constructed in refs. [31, 35].

5

monopole carries specic magnetic charges of the unbroken u(1)n 1 gauge group as well as
an instanton charge. the magnetic charge of the kk-monopole is such that when all n types

of monopoles are present, the magnetic charges cancel and the resulting conguration only

carries a unit instanton charge.

the n  1 fundamental monopoles are the embeddings of the standard su(2) bps
monopole [3841] on r3 spanned by x1,2,3 (independent of the s1 coordinate x4) in the gauge
group su(n). at nite radius , these monopoles have nite action and hence contribute

to the path integral in the semi-classical regime as described in refs. [42, 43] and [30, 44, 45].

the monopole solutions satisfy bogomolnyi equations that are precisely the 4d self-duality
equations5

fmn = fmn ,

(1.10)

and each solution has two adjoint fermion zero-modes as enumerated by the callias index

theorem [46]. the same consideration applies to the kk-monopole as well, since it is at

least formally gauge equivalent to a standard fundamental monopole via an improper (non-

periodic) gauge transformation [4]. since there are two adjoint fermion zero-modes in the

background of each of the n types of monopoles, these congurations can contribute directly

to (cid:10) tr2
162(cid:11).

the remainder of the paper is organized as follows. initially, we focus on the case with

su(2) gauge group; the generalization to su(n) is then obvious.
in general, the theory
on the cylinder can develop a vev for the gauge eld component along the s1 direction,
eq. (1.6), which for the case of su(2) gauge group we parametrize as

ha4i = v

 3

2i  diag(cid:0)

v
2i

,

v

2i(cid:1) ,

(1.11)

where v is an arbitrary real parameter which parametrizes the classical moduli space. for

every xed v there are actually two distinct vacua corresponding to the choice of theta angle

eq. (1.8).

in the section ii, we will show using eld theory arguments, backed-up by a

d-brane analysis, that:

(i) the classical moduli space is a circle,

v  s1 :

0  v 

2


.

(1.12)

5in the usual interpretation of the self-duality equations for the monopole, the time component of the
gauge eld is interpreted as the higgs eld; in the present discussion this eld is the component of the gauge
eld along the compact direction.

6

consequently, v is an angular variable such that for any xed v 6= 0, 2/, the gauge group
is broken to u(1).

(ii) there is a conventional t hooft-polyakov bps monopole and an additional compen-

sating kk-monopole, each of which satises the self-duality equations (1.10) and admits two

adjoint fermion zero-modes. the singly-charged instanton solution is a composite congura-

tion of these two monopoles and as expected has four adjoint fermion zero-modes.

section iii is devoted to an evaluation of the monopole-generated superpotential which

has the eect of lifting the classical degeneracy parametrized by v. we argue that the true

quantum vacuum state is simply the point

vvac =




.

(1.13)

furthermore, at v = vvac the eective potential is zero and supersymmetry remains unbroken.
hence, there are two supersymmetry-preserving vacua with (1.13) and labelled by 1 = 0 and
2 = 2, as per (1.8), in agreement with the calculation of the witten index tr(1)f = 2 [33].
moreover, we discover that the superpotential not only lifts the classically at direction, but

also gives a mass to the dual (magnetic) photon, which implies connement of the original

electric photon and disappearance of all the massless modes.

section iv then goes on to consider the monopole contribution to the gluino condensate.

in the quantum vacua, the gluino condensate (cid:10) tr2
162(cid:11) receives contributions from both the bps
and kk-monopoles. after summing these contributions, we then take the decompactication
limit  =  to obtain the value of gluino condensate in the strongly coupled n = 1 theory
which agrees with the wci calculation (1.1b). section v concludes with a brief discussion.

ii semi-classical congurations

in this section, we consider in more detail the congurations which contribute to the semi-

classical physics for the theory on the cylinder. we begin with a discussion of the su(2)

case, follow with an alternative description in terms of d-branes and then indicate how the

results generalize to the su(n) gauge group.

7

ii.1 gauge group su (2)

to verify that the classical moduli space is s1, consider a non-periodic (hence improper)
gauge transformation [4]

uspecial = exp (cid:0)

x4
i

 3(cid:1) .

(2.1)

improper gauge transformations are treated dierently from proper ones in the path integral,

in the sense that two eld congurations related by such a gauge transformation do not belong

to the same gauge orbit. the transformation uspecial, however, has a special property: even
though it is not itself periodic, uspecial(x4 = 0) = uspecial(x4 = ), the corresponding gauge
transformed eld congurations:

a

m = exp (cid:0)
 = exp (cid:0)

remain strictly periodic, i.e.

x4
i
x4

 3(cid:1) (am + m) exp (cid:0) 
 3(cid:1)  exp (cid:0)

(2.2)

a

m(x, x4 = 0) = a

m(x, x4 = ) ,

(x, x4 = 0) = (x, x4 = ) .

(2.3)

applied to the third component of the gauge eld (1.11), the transformation uspecial shifts

v according to

ha

4i = (v 

2


)

 3
2i

.

(2.4)

thus, using a sequence of these transformation one can ratchet-down an arbitrary value of
v  r, to the range specied in (1.12). in fact the sectors of the theory with v = v and
v = v + 2/ are physically indistinguishable; one is obtained from the other by relabelling

the kaluza-klein modes of the compact direction, i.e. relabelling the matsubara frequencies
n = 2n/ with n  z associated to the compact x4  s1 variable.

the standard bps monopole solution in hedgehog gauge [40, 41] is

(2.5)

these expressions are obviously independent of the s1 variable x4, since the latter can be
thought of as the time coordinate of the static monopole. the boundary values of (2.5) as
|x|  , when gauge rotated to unitary (singular) gauge, agree with (1.11):

(2.7)

there are precisely two adjoint fermion zero modes [46] in the monopole background (2.5).

these modes can be generated by supersymmetry transformations of the bosonic monopole

components in (2.5), yielding

bps

2(mn) 

 f bps

(2.8)

here m and n are the four pauli matrices and  is the two-component grassmann collective
coordinate; see footnote 2. finally, the monopole has magnetic charge one, instanton charge

zero, and the action sbps is

sbps =

4
g2 v .

(2.9)

the monopole of the second typethe kk monopolecan be obtained [4] from the
expressions (2.5) by, rstly, replacing the vev v on the right-hand side of (2.5) with 2/v,
and then gauge transforming the resulting expression with uspecial as in (2.2). finally to
install the original vev v one performs the reection v  v implemented by the discrete
transformation ure = exp[i 2/4]. the resulting conguration is the kk-monopole akk
m
m , it must, as described earlier, be accounted in the path
and, though gauge related to abps

integral as contributing to a dierent topological sector.

the improper gauge transformation uspecial changes [31] the instanton charge, k  k + q,
and reverses the sign of the magnetic charge, q  q. thus the kk-monopole has instanton
charge k = 1 and monopole charge q = 1. the kk-monopole is itself self-dual and its
action and topological charge are:

skk =

qkk = 1

4
g2  (

(2.10)

as for the original bps monopole, there are two adjoint fermion zero-modes (and no anti-
fermion zero-modes) in the kk-monopole background:6

 = 1
kk

2(mn) 

 f kk

mn .

(2.11)

6the kk-monopole is self-dual and not anti-self-dual, and the fact that it has negative rather than positive

magnetic charge is irrelevant for the fermion zero mode counting.

9

as was mentioned earlier, ref. [31] gave a complete topological classication of the smooth
nite-action gauge elds on r3  s1 in terms of the three invariants: the instanton number
k, magnetic charge q and the vev v, in terms of which

scl =

82
g2 (k + q

v
2

) ,

q = k + q

v
2

.

(2.12)

comparing eqs. (2.12) for the bps monopole and the kk-monopole with the charges of

a single instanton, it is tempting to interpret the latter as the mixed bps-monopole/kk-

monopole conguration. this interpretation is made precise in ref. [37], based on earlier

work of refs. [36, 37] and [2]. we also note that the two gaugino zero-modes of the kk-

monopole combined with the two zero-modes of the bps-monopole produce the requisite

four adjoint fermion zero-modes of the su(2) instanton.

ii.2 d-brane description

identical conclusions to those reached in sec. ii.1, can be reached in a more geometrical way

using d-brane technology and for the additional insight that this point-of-view provides we
describe it here.7

for the geometrical interpretation of the construction, the n = 4 case is most straightfor-
ward; the modication of this set-up relevant to describe the n = 1 theory will be considered
subsequently. therefore we begin with two coincident d3-branes whose collective dynam-
ics is described by n = 4 supersymmetric su(2) yang-mills on the four-dimensional world
volume [48, 49].

we now proceed to wrap the world-volume of our d3-branes on the cylinder r3  s1,
with the radius r = /2. with this accomplished, one performs a t-duality transformation

along the compact direction. the t-duals of the d3-branes are d2-branes stretched along
r3 and lying orthogonal to the dual circle s1 with radius r = /r. in the presence of the
non-trivial wilson line eq. (1.11), the d2-branes become separated by a distance 2v along

the direction of the dual circle [49]. due to the periodicity around the circle, we may restrict
0  2v  (2)2/, which is equivalent to eq. (1.12).

in the t-dual picture, a bps monopole can be represented by a d0-brane of length

lbps = 2v stretched between the two d2-branes. the orientation of the d0-brane (whether

7for a discussion of n = 1 theories and instantons in the context of branes see ref. [47].

10

the d0-brane is stretched between the rst and second d2-brane, or vice-versa) corresponds

to positive or negative magnetic charge, i.e. the monopole or anti-monopole. the monopole
mass is the product of the d0-brane tension 0 = 2/(g2) and the d0-brane length lbps:

mbps = 0 lbps =

4v
g2

,

(2.13)

in agreement with eq. (2.9).

actually, as one might have guessed, there is an innite tower of monopoles of the same
magnetic charge coming from the kaluza-klein tower over s1 formed by wrapping the d0-
brane an arbitrary number of times around the circle. another way to view the same

phenomenon, is to consider the freedom to add to a monopole a closed d0-loop starting
and ending on the same d2-brane and winding around s1; the length of the loop being
lloop = (2)2/. this d0-loop over the d2-brane can be identied with the instanton.
indeed, after the t-duality transformation along the s1 direction, the d2-brane becomes
the d3-brane and the d0-loop becomes a d(1)-brane, or d-instanton. the d3/d(1)
bound-state is the identied with an instanton having charge equal the winding number of
the d0-loop over s1, and vanishing magnetic charge. the instanton action is in a similar
fashion to eq. (2.13)

sinst = minst =  0 lloop =

82
g2

,

(2.14)

in agreement with eq. (2.12). in summary, the standard bps-monopole is the lowest-lying

kaluza-klein state with magnetic charge one: the d0-brane between the rst and the second

d2-brane. the monopole of the second typethe kk-monopoleappears as the d0-brane
between the second d2-brane and the rst one (hence the magnetic charge q = 1) complet-
ing the dual circle s1 (hence carrying instanton number k = 1). furthermore, the bound-state
of the standard and the kk-monopole is the d0-loop, i.e. the instanton. notice that stan-

dard bps monopole and the kk-monopole (together with their respective anti-monopoles)

are the elemental congurations, out of which the whole set of semi-classical congurations

with arbitrary k and q can be built.

although we have described this picture in terms of the n = 4 theory, the whole analysis
applies to the n = 1 case as well with certain modications. the n = 1 four-dimensional
yang-mills theory is obtained in a d-braney fashion from a conguration of two coincident

d4-branes suspended between two ns5-branes, in a manner described in refs. [50, 51]. the
world-volume of the d4-branes is innite in four directions r4 and is nite in the fth direction
5, which is the separation between the ns5-branes along the d4-branes. following the same
line of reasoning as in the n = 4 case, the innite part of the world-volume of the d4-branes

11

is put on the cylinder and t-dualized. the t-duals of the d4-branes on 5  r3  s1 are the
d3-branes stretched along 5  r3 and orthogonal to the dual circle s1 with the dual radius
r = /r. in the presence of the non-trivial wilson line eq. (1.11), the d3-branes become
separated [49] by the distance 2v along the dual circle, which is equivalent to eq. (1.12).

in the n = 4 theory the d2-branes are bps congurations and consequently, when at
rest, there is no interaction between them. thus, their separation along the dual circle is
arbitrary, i.e. v is an arbitrary modulus. in the n = 1 theory, the d3-branes are not bps
congurations. in the next section, via an explicit calculation of a superpotential, we will

prove that they actually repel each other. geometrically this implies that the two d3-branes

stay at the opposite ends of the dual circle and consequently v = /. hence, the classically

at direction is lifted precisely in the manner predicted by eq. (1.13).

the previous set-up described in the context of su(2) can be immediately generalized to

su(n). we now have n d3-branes positioned along a circle and repelling each other; hence

one expects

aj  aj+1 =

2
in

mod

2
i

,

j = 1, 2, . . . , n ,

(2.15)

and hence, (1.7). the n types of the monopole-like congurations are composed from n  1
standard bps monopoles represented by the d1-branes of minimal lengths stretched between
the adjacent uth and (u + 1)th d3-branes, u = 1, . . . , n  1. the kk-monopole is the d1-
brane stretched between the n th and 1st d3-branes. the instanton, as before, is the closed
d1-loop around the s1 direction.

iii evaluation of the superpotential

in this section, we will determine the superpotential of the n = 1 supersymmetric su(2)
yang-mills theory on r3  s1. the superpotential is trivial in perturbation theory, but
receives non-perturbative contributions as described in ref. [43]. contributions arise from

both types of monopole: bps and kk. as advertised earlier, the classical moduli space (1.12)

will be lifted by the superpotential in accordance with eqs. (1.7) and (1.13).

in the presence of a non-vanishing vev v, elds with isospin components not aligned
with the scalar vev eq. (1.11), acquire masses m  v via the higgs mechanism. the
massless elds are consequently the u(1) projections a3
m and 3 of the non-abelian elds aa
m
and a, a = 1, 2, 3. moreover, since x4 is periodic, each eld can be fourier analyzed as an

12

expansion over the discrete matsubara frequencies n = 2n/ with all the n 6= 0 modes
being massive kaluza-klein modes. the n = 0 modes correspond to the elds independent of

the x4 coordinate. thus, the classically massless degrees-of-freedom are the x4-independent
u(1) elds a(x), (x), (x) and (x) dened8 as in appendix a of ref. [30]:

where  = , and  are the three-dimensional gamma-matrices. the presence of the
monopoles in the microscopic theory means we must also include a surface term ssf in the
action (3.2):

ssf =

due to dirac quantization of magnetic charge:

q =

8 z d3x f  z ,

in (3.3)  is a periodic lagrange multiplier variable with period 2/.

(3.3)

(3.4)

following polyakov [42] an equivalent dual description of the low-energy theory (3.2) and

(3.3) can be obtained by promoting  to be a dynamical eld (x). this eld serves as

the lagrange multiplier for the bianchi identity constraint. the classical action for massless

elds then contains the terms

z d3x(cid:0)

f +   (cid:1) .

(3.5)

at this stage the photon eld-strength f(x) can be integrated out, and the resulting classical
massless action reads

8note that the calculations in appendix a of ref. [30] and the details of the comactication to 3d were
given in minkowski space with x3 and not x4 being the compactied direction. here we analytically continue
the results of [30] to euclidean space.

(3.8)

it is more convenient for our purposes to use a more compact form of eqs. (3.6) and (3.8)

involving the complex complex scalar z and fermion :

z =  + i ,

 =  + i  ,

z =   i ,
 =   i  ,

in terms of which the action is

scl =

and the supersymmetry transformations are
z = 2 ,

 z = 2  ,
  = 2( ) z ,

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

where we have introduced the innitesimal supersymmetry transformation parameter  =

non-perturbative quantum eects will modify the classical action for massless elds,
eq. (3.10), by generating a superpotential w() and w( ) written in terms of the chiral
and anti-chiral n = 1 superelds:

 = z + 2 + f ,
 = z + 2  +   f .

(3.12)

with the addition of this superpotential, the resulting quantum low-energy eective action

reads

se = scl +



g2 z d3x(cid:16)z d2 w() + z d2  w( )(cid:17) .

(3.13)

14

as usual, the scalar potential ve is determined by the derivatives of the superpotential with
respect to the scalar elds

ve = f f =

w
z

 w
 z

.

(3.14)

the true vacuum corresponds to the minimum of ve. in general ve  0, and supersymmetry
is unbroken only if the vacuum solution has ve = 0.

we are now ready to calculate the superpotential w() and hence the true ground state
of the theory in the semi-classical approximation. since the standard bps monopole and the

kk-monopole have two fermion zero-modes apiece, eqs. (2.8) and (2.11), they both generate
mass terms for classically massless fermions , while the corresponding anti-monopoles will
generate a mass for :

lmass =

m 
2

  +

m
2

 = m 

33 + m33 .

(3.15)

the supersymmetric completion of (3.15) in the low-energy eective action will give the

superpotential in question. the masses (3.15) are determined by examining the large distance

behaviour of the correlators

g(2)
 (x, y) = h3
g(2)
 (x, y) = h3

(x)3
(x)3

using the lsz reduction formulae, somewhat along the lines of ref. [43], we nd

(x, y)  2m  z d3x sf(x  x)sf(y  x) ,

(x, y)  2m z d3x sf(x  x)sf(y  x) .

(3.17a)

(3.17b)

here sf(x) is the massless fermion propagator in 3d, or, equivalently, the weyl-fermion
propagator on r3  s1 with zero matsubara frequency: sf(x) = x/(4|x|)2.

we rst consider the contribution of a single standard bps-monopole, (2.5) and (2.8), to

m :

(x)3

h3

(y)ibps = z dbpsld

 (x)ld

 (y) ,

(3.18)

where ld

 (x) is the large distance (ld) limit of the fermion zero modes (2.8) as computed

in appendix c of ref. [30]:

 (x) = 8sf(x  x) 
ld

  ,

(3.19)

15

and dbps is the semiclassical integration measure of the standard single-monopole on r3s1:

z dbps = m 3

.

(3.20)

this measure is obtained in the standard way by changing variables in the path integral

from eld uctuations around the monopole to the monopoles collective coordinates: x
(position),  (u(1)-angle) and  (grassmann collective coordinates). the relevant jacobian
factors in (3.20) are taken from ref. [30]. in contradistinction with the 3d calculation of [30],

our present calculation is locally four-dimensional, i.e in the path integral we have integrated
over the uctuations around the monopole conguration in r3s1. thus, the uv-regularized
determinants over non-zero eigenvalues of the quadratic uctuation operators cancel between
fermions and bosons due to supersymmetry as in ref. [52].9 the ultra-violet divergences are
regularized in the pauli-villars scheme, which explains the appearance of the pauli-villars
mass scale mpv to a power given by nb nf/2 = 3, where nb = 4 and nf = 2 are, respectively,
the numbers of bosonic and fermionic zero-modes of the monopole. collecting together the

expressions in eqs. (2.9), (3.17a), (3.18), (3.19) and (3.20), we nd the single-monopole
contribution to m  is

mbps

 = 1622m 3

pv exp(cid:2) 

4

g2 v(cid:3) .

(3.21)

this expression ignores the contributions of monopoleanti-monopole pairs in the back-

ground of the single monopole conguration and since monopoleanti-monopole interactions

are long-range (coulombic) their eects are considerable and must be taken into account.

this is precisely the famous polyakov eect [42] and fortunately there is a very elegant way

to incorporate it. the interactions of a single monopole with the monopoleanti-monopole

medium can be taken into account in a way by simply coupling the monopole to the mag-

netic photon (x) (or (x)) introduced earlier, in eqs. (3.3) and (3.7), and at the same time

promoting the vev v to a dynamical scalar eld (x). the coupling of the dual photon to

the monopole of magnetic charge q is dictated by the surface term in eq. (3.3). naturally

enough, one is instructed [42, 43] to change the action (2.12) of the original semi-classical

conguration as follows:

82

v

82

(x)

scl =

g2 (cid:0)k + q

2(cid:1) 

g2 (cid:0)k + q

2 (cid:1) + iq(x) .

this means that the mass becomes a local coupling:
4
g2 (x) + i

 (x) = 1622m 3

mbps

pv exp(cid:2) 

4

g2 (x)(cid:3) .

(3.22)

(3.23)

9in order to invoke the result of [52] one needs the self-duality of the solution, a covariant background

gauge, four dimensions and supersymmetry.

16

it is straightforward to derive the single kk-monopole contribution to m . it is obtained
in the same way as the expression on the right hand side of (3.21), but instead of sbps in
(3.20) one has to use skk of (2.10):10

mkk

 = 1622m 3

pv exp(cid:2) 

4

g2 (2  v)(cid:3) .

(3.24)

the total mass coupling m (x) is then given by the sum of the standard bps- and
the kk-monopole contributions, each embedded into the dual magnetic eld theory as per

eq. (3.22):

m (x) = 1622m 3

pv

(cid:16) exp(cid:2) 

4
g2 (x) + i

4

g2 (x)(cid:3) + exp(cid:2) 

82
g2 +

4
g2 (x)  i

4

g2 (x)(cid:3)(cid:17) .

(3.25)

in the second term above, we used the fact that the kk-monopole has qkk = 1 and kkk = 1.
denoting the overall coecient in (3.25) as m:

m  1622m 3

pv ,

(3.26)

and making use of the complex scalar eld and fermion of (3.9) we nally get the following

expression for the mass term:

m
2

4
g2

lmass =

(x) (x) (cid:16) exp(cid:2) 

z(x)(cid:3)(cid:17) .
this coupling corresponds to a superpotential w( ) term in (3.13) of the form:
(cid:3)(cid:17) .

z(x)(cid:3) + exp(cid:2) 

w( ) = (cid:16) g2

4(cid:17)2

(cid:3) + exp(cid:2) 

m (cid:16) exp(cid:2) 

82
g2 +

4
g2

4
g2

82
g2 +

4
g2

equivalently, the anti-monopoles generate the hermitian conjugate:

w() = (cid:16) g2

4(cid:17)2

m (cid:16) exp(cid:2) 

4

g2 (cid:3) + exp(cid:2) 

82
g2 +

4

g2 (cid:3)(cid:17) .

(3.27)

(3.28)

(3.29)

with the expression for the superpotential in hand, we can now calculate the scalar

potential (3.14) and determine the true vacuum state of the theory. consider

f =

w
z

= 

mg2

4 (cid:16) exp(cid:2) 

4

g2 z(cid:3)  exp(cid:2) 

82
g2 +

4

g2 z(cid:3)(cid:17) .

(3.30)

10this is because the kk-monopole is gauge equivalent to the standard monopole with a wrong vev as

explained in the sec. ii.1

17

the supersymmetry preserving vacuum hzi = hi + ihi corresponds to

f (hzi) = 0

= hzi =




,

(3.31)

which corresponds to the scalar vev hi  v = / as predicted in (1.13).

note that since hi = 0 the dual photon does not condense, as expected. what is much

more interesting is that the dual photon becomes massive,

ve( =




, (x)) = 2 (cid:16)mg2
4 (cid:17)2

exp(cid:2) 

82

g2 (cid:3) (cid:0)1  cos

8

g2 (x)(cid:1) ,

(3.32)

which implies connement of the original electric photon and the corresponding disappearance

of all the massless modes.

iv gluino condensate from monopoles

in this section, we use our description of the quantum vacuum state of the theory to evaluate

the monopole contribution to the gluino condensate.

iv.1 gauge group su (2)

we are now in a position to directly compute gluino condensate in the su(2) theory. firstly,

we evaluate the standard bps monopole contribution to (cid:10)tr2(cid:11):
(2)3/2 [g2sbps]3/2 z 2

(cid:10)tr2(cid:11)bps = m 3

[g2sbps/v2]1/2

(4.1)

tr(bps (x)bps

 (x)) ,

where we have used the expression (3.20) for the monopole measure. to evaluate (4.1), we

use the normalization of fermion zero modes from ref. [30]:

z d3x z d2 tr (bps (x)bps

 (x)) = 2sbps

g2


.

a straightforward calculation gives

(cid:28) tr2
162(cid:29)bps

=

pv exp(cid:2) 

82

18

(4.2)

(4.3)

the kk-monopole contribution is obtained by changing sbps  skk in the bps-expressions
above to give

v

 (cid:1) m 3

pv exp(cid:2)

82
g2

v

2(cid:3) .

(4.4)

the expressions (4.3) and (4.4) explicitly depend on the uv-cuto mpv and do not appear

to be renormalization group invariant. however, it is pleasing that in the true ground-state

established in the last section, this worrisome dependence disappears. at v = , we get

(cid:28) tr2
162(cid:29)bps

= (cid:28) tr2

162(cid:29)kk

= 1

2m 3

pv exp(cid:2) 

42

g2 (cid:3) .

finally, introducing the renormalization group invariant scale pv of the theory via

42

m 3

pv exp(cid:2) 

g2 (cid:3) = 3 ,

and adding together both monopole contributions we obtain a value for the gluino condensate:

this is precisely the value obtained in the wci approach (1.1b).

(cid:28) tr2
162(cid:29) = 3 .

(4.7)

iv.2 generalization to su (n )

the calculation of the superpotential and the gluino condensate can be straightforwardly

generalized to the case of su(n) gauge group. the quantum vacuum has

aj  aj+1 =

2
in

mod

2
i

,

j = 1, 2, . . . , n ,

(4.8)

and so each of the n types of monopoles (n  1 standard bps and one kk) have equal
actions and equal topological charges:

smono =

82
ng2 ,

qmono =

1
n

.

(4.9)

the contribution of a single monopole to the gluino condensate will be, in analogy with

eq. (4.5),

(cid:28) tr2
162(cid:29)bps

= (cid:28) tr2

162(cid:29)kk

=

1
n

m 3

pv exp(cid:2) 

82

ng2(cid:3) .

the rst coecient of the -function is now b0 = 3n and the analog of (4.6) reads

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.10)

(4.11)

finally, the total contribution of the n monopoles to the gluino condensate, as in su(2),

82

m 3n

pv exp(cid:2) 

g2 (cid:3) = 3n .

reproduces the wci value (1.1b).

v discussion

more than twenty years ago polyakov [42] famously observed that in three-dimensional gauge-

higgs theory without fermions the magnetic photon (x) gets a non-zero mass due to de-

bye screening in the monopoleanti-monopole plasma. the mass term for the dual photon

then implies connement of the original electric photon. a nave attempt to generalize

this mechanism to four dimensions by simply substituting the three-dimensional instantons

(i.e. monopoles) with four-dimensional instantons fails, since in four dimensions instantons

and anti-instantons have a dipoledipole interaction which is short-ranged and hence, the

instantonanti-instanton medium cannot form a coulomb plasma essential for polyakovs

debye mechanism. however, it has been suspected for a long time that instantons and anti-

instantons can be thought of as composite states of more basic congurationsinstanton

partonswhich would have long-range interactions and lead to a coulomb plasma and to

the debye screening.

in this paper, following earlier ideas of [27], we have identied the instanton partons
with monopoles in the four-dimensional gauge theory compactied on r3  s1. the debye
screening in the monopole plasma induces a non-zero mass for the dual photon. hence, we

have successfully generalized polyakovs mechanism of connement to the four-dimensional
supersymmetric gauge theory compactied on r3  s1.

as the vevs in eq. (1.7) are inversely proportional to the radius , the theory becomes

weakly coupled at small  and can be analysed semi-classically. to return to the strongly

coupled theory in minkowski space, we need to consider the opposite limit of large . since

all the f-terms are holomorphic functions of the elds and since the vevs of the elds (1.7)

are holomorphic functions of , the power of holomorphy [53] allows to analytically continue

the semi-classical values of the f-terms to the strong-coupling regime.

as a useful practical application and a test of monopole physics in r3  s1, we have
calculated the value of gluino condensate and taken the decompactication limit to reproduce

the wci result.
