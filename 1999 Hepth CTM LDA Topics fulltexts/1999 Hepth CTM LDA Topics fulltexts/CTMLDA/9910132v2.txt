abstract

we show that gravitational eects of global cosmic 3-branes can be responsible
for compactication from six to four space-time dimensions, naturally producing the
observed hierarchy between electroweak and gravitational forces. the nite radius of
the transverse dimensions follows from einsteins equation, and is exponentially large
compared with the scales associated with the 3-brane. the space-time ends on a mild
naked singularity at the boundary of the transverse dimensions; nevertheless unitary
boundary conditions render the singularity harmless.

1 introduction

the possibility that we are living in more than four dimensions has been considered sporadi-
cally by physicists since the time of kaluza [1] and klein [2, 3]. although originally motivated
by the possible unication of gravity with gauge forces, more recently there have been spec-
ulations that extra dimensions may also play an important role in addressing several other
outstanding phenomenological problems  in particular, the smallness of the cosmological
constant, the origin of the observed hierarchy between the w mass and the planck scale, the
nature of avor, the possible source of supersymmetry breaking, etc. in this paper we focus
on the possibility that extra dimensions may provide a resolution of the hierarchy problem.
there have been two distinct approaches using extra dimensions to deal with the hi-
erarchy problem. one relies on compact extra dimensions, curled up in such a way that
4-d phenomenology prevails. the other uses noncompact extra dimensions of innite ex-
tent. the rst category includes the large extra dimension approach, which postulates a
fundamental scale   10  100 tev along with kaluza-klein compactication at a large
radius r ( millimeters for two extra dimensions). the eective 4-d planck scale is then
the fundamental scale  times powers of r [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. if r is much larger than 1,
the eective planck scale will be much larger than the fundamental scale. this does not
solve the hierarchy problem but rather reformulates it into a dynamical question: why is
the radius r of the extra dimensions so much larger than 1/? mechanisms exist which
can answer this question [9]. another possible hierarchy solution arising from compact ex-
tra dimensions is the model of ref. [10], where an exponential warp factor gives rise to the
observed hierarchy, requiring an extra dimension only one or two orders of magnitude larger
than the fundamental length scale. a dynamical mechanism to stabilize the radius is still
needed, such as rst suggested in [11, 12].

it has been shown that ordinary 4-d gravity can result from a theory with innite extra
dimensions, provided that there exists a graviton bound to our 4-d submanifold [13, 14, 15].
such models do not in general solve the hierarchy problem. in refs. [16, 17] it was suggested
that, since the wave function of the bound 4-d graviton falls o exponentially in the direction
transverse to the 3-brane that binds it, the observed hierarchy of forces may be due to a
displacement of our world from that 3-brane.

in this paper we oer an alternative where the hierarchy arises from nite, but non-
compact extra dimensions. the phenomenology closely resembles the large extra dimension
scenario [5, 6, 8], but provides a dynamical explanation for the large radius. however, un-
like these earlier scenarios, the extra dimensions we consider form a non-compact space of
exponentially large proper size, terminating at a singularity. the spacetime we analyze is
the solution of einsteins equation in the presence of a global cosmic string [18].

we begin by solving einsteins equation for a global cosmic string in d + 2 dimen-
sions. by a string we will always mean a (d  1)-brane with 2 transverse spatial dimen-
sions. we analyze scalar and gravitational waves in this background metric, and demonstrate
that although the spacetime includes a naked singularity, it is suciently mild that unitary
boundary conditions can be applied. we then display the hierarchy between gravitational

1

and gauge forces, showing that it is not the result of any ne tuning, and does not lead
to disagreement with gravitational force experiments. we conclude by discussing possible
generalizations of our example.

2 the metric about a global string

a global cosmic string, or vortex, is a topologically stable scalar eld conguration with
nontrivial homotopy for some internal symmetry manifold. the simplest example arises in
a scalar eld theory with a spontaneously broken global u(1) symmetry. if the expectation
value of the scalar eld in the ground state is hi = f , a vortex with unit winding number
corresponds to the eld conguration (r) = f (r)ei, where lim
f (r) = f . unlike a vortex
r
with the u(1) gauged (such as the abelian higgs model), a global vortex has nonzero energy
density outside its core, falling o as 1/r2. it is therefore not surprising that, when gravity
is included, a curvature singularity appears exponentially far from the core of the vortex, as
was found in earlier work by the present authors for vortices in four spacetime dimensions
[18].

generalization of this earlier work to branes in d + 2 spacetime dimensions is straightfor-
ward. we assume that outside the core of a (d  1)-brane, the stress-energy tensor is that
of a charged scalar eld with lagrange density1 l = g  v () and expectation
value

 = f d/2ei ,

(1)

where f has dimensions of mass. the scalar eld eq. (1) is assumed to minimize the scalar
potential v (), and we tune the bulk cosmological constant to zero. we therefore look for
a metric which has a d-dimensional poincare invariant longitudinal space, and rotational
invariance in the transverse plane. the most general metric of this kind may be put in the
form

ds2 = a(u)2abdxadxb + 2 b(u)2(du2 + d2) ,

(2)

where xa parameterizes the longitudinal d-dimensional space, ab is the at minkowski metric,
and {u, } are the transverse coordinates, with   [0, 2). the parameter  has dimensions
of length, while u,  and the functions a and b are dimensionless. we will make the
somewhat perverse choice of placing the string core at large values of u, while the singularity
will appear at u = 0.

the non-zero components of the stress-energy tensor which follow from l and eq. (1)

are:

t i
j = i
j

f d
2 b2

,

t u

t

the einstein equations for this system are

(4)

where md+2 is the analogue of the planck mass in d + 2 dimensions.

on computing the einstein tensor from the metric in eq. (2), we arrive at the three

dierential equations

(d  1)( a )2 + a a = 0
a( b )2 + b(cid:2)d a b  d b a  a b(cid:3) = 0
a( b )2  b(cid:2)d a b + a b(cid:3) = 2

(7)

for a complete exterior solution these functions must be matched onto a metric valid within
the vortex core, determining the parameter , which naturally is of size   1/f .
note that our solution has a genuine curvature singularity at u = 0. (for example, the
laplacian of the ricci scalar diverges as  u2/d at u = 0.) furthermore, this is a naked
singularity, located at a nite proper distance from the string core near u  u0.
because of the existence of a naked singularity it is not immediately clear whether or
not sensible physical results follow from our solution [19, 20, 21]. there are two dierent
problems that might arise. the rst is that the existence of the singularity is not reliable,
precisely because gravitational forces become strong there. a higher derivative correction
to the einstein-hilbert action for example, would probably eliminateor at least change
the nature of the singularity. we will argue later that, while this may indeed happen in
extensions of einsteins theory, it would likely not change the conclusions we arrive at by
assuming the singularity to be physical.

a second problem is that the conservation of energy and momentum might be violated at
the singularity. this can be phrased as a question concerning the boundary conditions that
must be applied to elds at the singularity [22]. just as the irregular legendre functions
which appear when solving the non-relativistic schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom
must be discarded, as they correspond to probability loss at the origin, so must any solution
here which loses energy or momentum through the singularity. thus we must search for con-
ditions on elds propagating in the background metric that insure conservation of quantum

3

numbers at the singular boundary of the spacetime. the ability to nd such conditions is not
guaranteed if the singularity is too strong, however. to address this issue we rst consider
propagation of a massless scalar in our background metric; we then consider gravitational
perturbations.

3 scalar elds and boundary conditions

we consider a massless scalar eld  satisfying the wave equation

 =

1

g

(gg) = 0 .

(8)

it is convenient to introduce a second parameterization of the transverse radial dimension:

ds2 = a(z)2abdxadxb + a(z)2dz2 + 2b(z)2d2 ,

with

z = z u

0

b(u)
a(u)

du ,

a(z)  a(u(z)) ,

b(z)  b(u(z)) .

(9)

(10)

the functions a(u) and b(u) are the solutions found previously in eq. (6). for small u,
z behaves like z  u(d1)/2d, so that the singularity at u = 0 is also at z = 0. near the
singularity

a(z)  z2/(d1) ,

b(z) 

1
z

.

using the isometries of the background metric, we search for solutions of the form

 = eipxein (z)
1(z)

,

abpapb = m2 ,

where p  x  abpaxb and

1(z) = (gzzg)1/2 = (ad1b)1/2 .

(11)

(12)

(13)

the parameter m will be the conventional d-dimensional mass of this mode. the function
(z) then satises the equation

(cid:20)

d2

dz2 + v (z) + n2 a2

b2(cid:21) (z) = m2(z) ,

this equation can be recast in the more convenient form

(cid:20) qq + n2 a2

b2(cid:21) (z) = m2(z)

4

v (z) =


1
1

(14)

(15)

where

q = 

d
dz

+

d log 1(z)

dz

,

q =

d
dz

+

d log 1(z)

dz

.

(16)

in this form, the scalar wave equation clearly has two zeromode solutions with n = m = 0.
one such solution is easily identied

the second zeromode follows as

(z) = 1(z) .

(z) = 2(z)  1(z)z z

dz
1(z)2 = 1(z) log(u(z)) .

near the singularity at z = 0 these two solutions behave as

1(z)  z,

2(z)  z log z .

(17)

(18)

(19)

eq. (15) shows that the m2 and n2 terms become irrelevant near the singularity, and thus
all solutions behave similarly to the two zeromode solutions in the limit z  0. we will refer
to the solutions behaving as z near z = 0 as the regular solutions, while those behaving
as z ln z for small z will be called the irregular solutions.

the fact that our spacetime is geodesically incomplete should not matter provided that
no conserved quantities are allowed to leak out through the boundary. the d-dimensional
poincare isometries of the metric eq. (2), as well as the axial rotation isometry, lead to
conservation laws. the killing vectors corresponding to these isometries are

 = a2a
(a)

b
c b
(ab)
= a2(cid:0)a
  a
c(cid:1) xc

 = b2 
()


(20)

with a, b, c = 1 . . . d. for each of these killing vectors we may contract with the stress-energy
tensor to form a current

satisfying a covariant conservation law

j  = t 

(gj ) = 0 .

1

g

(21)

(22)

therefore we demand that the ux through the singular boundary of our spacetime must
vanish for each of these currents. for example, for the translation isometries this requires

gj z

(a) = lim
z0

ggzzaz = 0 .

lim
z0

(23)

5

using eq. (19) and the form of  eq. (12) we see that the ux through the singularity for
the regular solutions vanishes, while that for the irregular solutions diverges. therefore the
boundary conditions boundary conditions we have chosen eliminate the irregular solutions.
the other currents lead to the same condition.

once the irregular solutions have been discarded, it follows that that q = q; that is,
(1, q2) = (q1, 2) where 1,2 are arbitrary regular solutions, since the dierence between
the two expressions is a vanishing surface term. therefore qq is a positive semidenite
operator, implying that the m2 eigenvalues are all positive, so that no tachyonic modes are
seen in the d-dimensional world.

in fact the boundary condition eq. (23) (supplemented by appropriate boundary condi-
tions near the string core) is precisely the condition necessary to insure that the eigenvalue
problem specied by eqs. (8,12) is of the classic sturm-liouville type. thus not only is
the spectrum non-tachyonic, but the eigenfunctions are also complete, discrete, and my be
chosen to be orthogonal.

4 gravitational perturbations and newtons law of grav-

itation

we turn to the metric uctuations about the solution eq.
(6). the metric in (d + 2)-
dimensions has (d + 2)(d 1)/2 physical polarizations; for a d-dimensional observer these de-
compose into a d-dimensional graviton, 2 d-dimensional vectors and 3 d-dimensional scalars.
we rst focus on the d-dimensional graviton uctuations. we consider a perturbation of the
metric of the form

ds2 = a(z)2(ab + hab)dxadxb + a(z)2dz2 + 2b(z)2d2 ,

(24)

and impose the gauge conditions ahab = ha
the isometries of the background metric we will search for solutions of the form

a = 0, following the analysis of ref. [14]. using

hab = abeipxein (z)
1(z)

,

(25)

where ab is a constant polarization tensor, and 1 is the same function2 dened in eq. (13).
we can already identify one solution of the form eq. (25): the original metric eq. (9) has
an invariance under restricted general coordinate transformations along the brane. this is
enough to insure the presence of a massless graviton along the brane. the uctuation in the
metric corresponding to this mode may be found by replacing ab  gab; that is, the wave
function of this mode is just an hab independent of the transverse coordinates:

2note that, strictly speaking, it is the combination (ggii)1/2 that appears in the denominator of eq.

(25). for our coordinate choice, in which gii = gzz = 1/a2, this equals 1.

(z) = 1(z) ,

(26)

6

with n = m = 0.

the coupling of this mode to stress-energy along the brane may be computed by exam-

ining the action for this uctuation. using eqs. (25, 26) we get an action

s = m d

d+2z g dz d ddxp( + h)

rd
a2

(27)

where rd is the d-dimensional curvature computed from ( + h)ab. this allows identication
of the d-dimensional planck scale as 3:

m d2

d = m d

d+2 z 1(z)2 dz d = eu0u(d+1)/2d

0

(cid:18)d  1

2d (cid:19) 2m d

d+2 .

(28)

this form demonstrates the connection between the gravitational coupling in d-dimensions,
and the normalization of the zeromode 1. the factor eu0 dominates this expression, pro-
viding an exponential hierarchy. for the especially interesting case of d = 4, with  = 1/f ,
a ratio of m6/f  2.7 yields a hierarchy for m4/m6 of over 1017!
wave equation eq. (15) which we considered in the previous section:

the einstein equation for general uctuations of the form eq. (25) reduces to the scalar

(cid:20) qq + n2 a2

b2(cid:21) (z) = m2(z)

(29)

where q is the same operator as in the scalar case. our analysis is therefore identical to
that of the previous section: we discard all solutions for which (z) behaves like z log z
near the singularity. the remaining solutions include the zeromode, behaving as a massless
d-dimensional graviton on the brane4, and the kaluza-klein like modes with non-zero m2.
all these modes have (z) vanishing like z as we approach the singularity. since qq is
positive semidenite, we are assured that the kaluza-klein modes all have real masses, and
that there are no gravitational instabilities. furthermore, the spectrum is discrete, with
spacing set by

m2  1/z2

0 

(md+2)d
(md)d2 ,

(30)

where z0 = z(u0) and we made use of eq.
(28). this is the same relation one expects
in the large extra dimension scenario. since these kaluza-klein modes are coupled with
gravitational strength, they are still acceptable, even if they are extremely light [5].

as for the other modes of the graviton eld, we expect the three scalar modes and one
of the vector modes that arise from the decomposition to have masses on the same scale

3in principle we only trust the integrand in the region outside the string core. however the integral is
dominated by this regioninclusion of the string core changes the value of the integral by an exponentially
small amount.

4unlike in the scalar case, we are assured that there will be a solution with m2 = 0, since whatever occurs

in the core of the vortex will maintain general coordinate invariance.

7

as m. however, one of the vector modes is corresponds to the rotational isometry of the
metric. normally, one would then expect this eld to be the vector potential associated with
an unbroken u(1) gauge symmetry in the d-dimensional world. however, the scalar eld
 breaks the rotational symmetry. therefore this gravi-photon eats the goldstone boson
associated with phase rotations of , and gets a mass2 comparable to the m2 of eq. (30).

5 conclusions and speculations

we have shown that the metric outside a global cosmic 3-brane provides a dynamical de-
termination of the hierarchy between the high scale associated with newtons constant, 1019
gev, and the low scale associated with particle physics, a few tev. with no ne tuning
of fundamental parameters, this metric produces a nite, large transverse area. small uc-
tuations about this background metric behave as a normal, 4-d graviton along the brane.
the coupling of this mode to excitations on the brane, the eective newton constant, is
the 6-d newton constant, taken to be characterized by the tev scale5, divided by the area
of the transverse dimensions. since this area is related to the intrinsic scale by a factor
 exp((m6/f )4), a ratio of m6/f  2.7 easily provides the necessary hierarchy.
the fact that our metric is geodesically incomplete does not make our solution inconsis-
tent, since we are able to nd boundary conditions on our elds that guarantee no conserved
quantities are lost through the singularity. nevertheless, we expect that physics beyond
einsteins theory will alter the nature of the singularity, and possibly eliminate it altogether.
even in the latter case, gravity would become strong, even if not singular, only at an expo-
nentially large distance from the vortex. the key feature of our solution  the dynamical
generation of an exponentially large length scale  would remain intact. furthermore, it is
quite plausible that the low lying solutions to the wave equations we have considered will not
be appreciably altered, precisely because the boundary conditions we have chosen make the
solutions insensitive to what is happening at the singularity. they would be analogous to the
low lying quantum mechanical states in a deep square well potential, which are insensitive
to whether the potential is actually innite outside the box, or whether it is nite but large.
in our discussion the nature of the 3-brane played little role. the only requirement
was the existence of stress-energy of the form eq. (3). such a stress-energy tensor applies
when scalar eld equations have stable brane solutions from spontaneously broken global
symmetries (such as a cosmic string), or from long range eldss [24] attached to d-brane6.
while we specically discussed a brane with codimension equal to two, it seems possible
that one could nd similar solutions with exponentially large extra dimensions starting with
branes of other codimensions  preferably a d-brane that could support a realistic 4-d
world. it is interesting to speculate whether the winding number of a bulk topological eld
about this brane could determine the number and chirality of families living on the brane.

5this scale may need to be more nearly 100 tev to satisfy all phenomenological constraints [23].
6the example of arkani-hamed, dimopolous and march-russell [25] for obtaining logarithmic running
through a massless scalar eld coupled to a 3-brane provides another example of a d-brane as a source for
a massless scalar eld
