abstract

we analyze in detail a specic 5-dimensional realization of a brane-universe
scenario where the visible and hidden sectors are localized on spatially sepa-
rated 3-branes coupled only by supergravity, with supersymmetry breaking
originating in the hidden sector. although general power counting allows
order 1/m 2
planck contact terms between the two sectors in the 4-dimensional
theory from exchange of supergravity kaluza-klein modes, we show that
they are not present by carefully matching to the 5-dimensional theory. we
also nd that the radius modulus corresponding to the size of the com-
pactied dimension must be stabilized by additional dynamics in order to
avoid run-away behavior after supersymmetry breaking and to understand
the communication of supersymmetry breaking. we stabilize the radius by
adding two pure yangmills sectors, one in the bulk and the other localized
on a brane. gaugino condensation in the 4-dimensional eective theory
generates a superpotential that can naturally x the radius at a suciently
large value that supersymmetry breaking is communicated dominantly by
the recently-discovered mechanism of anomaly mediation. the mass of the
radius modulus is large compared to m3/2. the stabilization mechanism
requires only parameters of order one at the fundamental scale, with no
ne-tuning except for the cosmological constant.

1 introduction

supersymmetry (susy) breaking communicated by supergravity (sugra) is a very
natural and attractive solution to the hierarchy problem. in its usual incarnation, this
mechanism requires only a hidden sector that breaks susy, and the presence in the
eective theory below the planck scale of the following higher-dimension operators
connecting the hidden and visible sector elds:

1
m 2
4

le z d4
+z d2

hqq + (huhd + h.c.)i
m4 hw w + (huhd + h.c.)i .

1

(1.1)

here, m4 is the 4-dimensional planck scale,  is a eld in the hidden sector with
hfi 6= 0, q is a matter eld in the visible sector, hu,d are higgs elds, and w is
a eld strength for the standard model gauge group. this simple setup generates all
required soft susy breaking terms of order hfi/m4  m3/2 (including the  term
[1]).

the main drawback of this scenario is that it does not explain why the squark

masses generated from the term r d4 qq approximately conserve avor, as re-

quired to avoid excessive avor-changing neutral currents. ref. [2] proposed an ele-
gant solution to this problem in the context of higher-dimensional theories. it was
pointed out that if the visible and hidden sectors are localized on spatially sepa-
rated 3-branes, then contact terms of the form eq. (1.1) can be suppressed even
though they are not forbidden by any symmetry of the low-energy theory. this can
be easily understood by focusing on the eective d-dimensional theory (d4) below
the string scale m, but above the compactication scale 1/r. if the hidden and vis-
ible branes are separated by a distance of order r, then the contribution from the
exchange of bulk elds of mass m  1/r is suppressed by the yukawa factor em r.
we also expect the contributions of extended objects with string-scale tensions to be
exponentially suppressed by em r. we see that stringy physics generates only expo-
nentially small contact terms in the d-dimensional eective theory. when we match
the d-dimensional theory to the 4-dimensional low-energy eective theory, a more
careful analysis is required to show that the exchange of supergravity kaluza-klein
(kk) excitations does not lead to contact kahler terms of order 1/m 2
4 . we perform
this analysis for a specic model in this paper, with the result that no such terms are
generated. thus, all of the eective interactions of the form of eq. (1.1) are highly
suppressed, and susy breaking must be communicated in a dierent way.

ref. [2] further argued that, given this suppression of the terms in eq. (1.1), the

1

leading contribution to susy breaking in the visible sector arises at loop level, and is
directly related to the conformal anomaly. this mechanism applied to gaugino masses
and a terms was independently discovered in ref. [3], which also gave a detailed dis-
cussion of the exactness of the result.
in this anomaly-mediated supersymmetry
breaking (amsb) scenario, all soft susy breaking parameters are completely pre-
dicted up to an overall scale by anomalous dimensions and conserve avor to a high
degree. this leads to interesting testable predictions for the gaugino masses [2, 3, 4].
unfortunately, the slepton mass-squared terms are predicted to be negative if the
visible sector is the minimal supersymmetric standard model. there are have been
several suggestions in the literature for natural solutions to this problem [5].

in this paper we investigate the basic features of the amsb scenario in detail
in a specic 5-dimensional eective eld theory. the theory consists of minimal 5-
dimensional sugra compactied on a s1/z2 orbifold. the two (3 + 1)-dimensional
boundaries of this space corresponding to the orbifold xed-points serve as the 3-
branes on which the hidden and visible sectors are localized. the higher susy of
the 5-dimensional theory is broken explicitly down to n = 1 in 4 dimensions by
the orbifold projection. this setup is very similar to the ve-dimensional eective
theory arising from heterotic m-theory after calabi-yau compactication of six of
the eleven dimensions [6, 7, 8, 9], but our eld content is the minimal one required
for consistency of the ve-dimensional eective theory. in particular, the calabi-yau
moduli do not appear as light elds in our ve-dimensional model. this accounts
for the substantial dierences between amsb and other analyses of supersymmetry
breaking in the heterotic m-theory scenario. we defer consideration of non-minimal
eld content for later work. our nal result is that anomaly mediation is the leading
source of susy breaking in the visible sector if the radius is suciently large, but
it is crucial to take into account the dynamics of the radius of the compactied
dimension. while our analysis is limited to a specic 5-dimensional theory with a
particular mechanism for stabilizing the radius, we believe that these features are
more general.

starting with the 5-dimensional theory described above, we construct the 4-
dimensional eective theory below the compactication scale to analyze susy break-
ing. as already mentioned, a crucial feature of the eective theory is the presence
of a radius modulus corresponding to the size of the compactied dimension.
in
particular, if this modulus is not stabilized we will show that its equations of mo-
tion set to zero the supersymmetry breaking order parameter for amsb, namely the
four-dimensional sugra auxiliary scalar. this agrees with a direct ve dimensional
sugra analysis, where there are no bulk elds which can transmit the eect of such

2

an order parameter to the visible sector. this naturally raises doubts as to whether
amsb occurs in this scenario [9]. a related issue is the fact that the radius modulus
must be stabilized in order to cancel the cosmological constant in the presence of
susy breaking. we show that if the bare bulk cosmological constant is zero, there is
no potential for the radius modulus, but the low-energy cosmological constant cannot
be cancelled. in the presence of a bulk cosmological constant, susy breaking gives
this modulus a runaway potential.

the picture changes completely when a stablization mechanism is introduced for
the radius. we propose a stabilization mechanism for the radius modulus that relies
entirely on gaugino condensation and susy breaking. the mechanism requires two
super-yangmills (sym) sectors, one in the bulk and one localized on a 3-brane, as
well as a susy breaking sector localized on the hidden 3-brane. upon matching to the
4-dimensional theory, the bulk sym sector gives rise to a 4-dimensional sym sector
with a gauge coupling that depends on the radius r. this gives rise to an r-dependent
gaugino condensate which, together with the brane-localized gaugino condensate,
gives a stabilizing potential for the radius modulus.1 the radius is naturally large
compared m5 if the condensation scale of the 3-brane super-yangmills sector bdy
is small compared to m5. the radius depends only logarithmically on bdy, we can
obtain a suciently large radius for anomaly mediation to dominate if the theory
is strongly coupled near the scale m5.2 since the condensation scale of the 3-brane
super-yangmills sector is naturally exponentially small compared to the fundamental
scale, this mechanism does not require the introduction of small parameters at the
fundamental scale. susy breaking (and ne-tuning) is required to cancel the net low-
energy cosmological constant. the mass of the radius modulus is large compared to
m3/2, and the eective theory below this scale is of the sequestered form proposed
in ref. [2]. the general lesson we draw from this is that amsb works provided
that moduli are stabilized. our stabilization is similar in spirit to the racetrack
mechanism [12], but it does not require large gauge groups and our results follow
from a completely systematic eective eld theory analysis.

this paper is organized as follows.

in section 2 we describe the 5-dimensional
model and carry out the matching to the 4-dimensional eective theory. we show

1a similar mechanism can be used to stabilize the radius in non-supersymmetric theories [10].

this may be interesting for solutions of the hierarchy problem involving extra dimensions that are

only slightly larger than the fundamental scale [11].

2it is interesting that even for strong coupling, this mechanism gives a radius that is naturally

close to the scale where bulk gravitational loops give a contribution to soft masses comparable to

the contributions of anomaly mediation. we will not pursue this possibility here.

that there are no o(1/m 2
4 ) contact terms between the hidden and visible sectors, and
that the cosmological constant cannot be cancelled in the absence of a mechanism
for radius stabilization. in section 3, we show how gaugino condensation can x the
radius, and show that anomaly mediation works in this scenario. section 4 contains
our conclusions.

2 from 5 to 4 dimensions

2.1 the 5-dimensional model

we consider minimal (ungauged) 5-dimensional sugra compactied on a s1/z2
orbifold with matter and gauge elds localized on the two orbifold boundaries. this
system is relatively simple to study because the orbifold projection explicitly breaks
the supersymmetry of the 5-dimensional theory (8 real supercharges) down to n = 1
in 4 dimensions (4 real supercharges).

the on-shell lagrangian for the bosonic elds of 5-dimensional sugra is [13]

lsugra,5 = m 3

4h m n hm n(cid:17)

2r(5) + 1
m n p qrbm hn p hqr + fermion terms#,

(2.1)

where m, n, . . . = 0, . . . , 3, 5, are 5-dimensional spacetime indices, and hm n =
m bn  m bn is the eld strength for the graviphoton bm . under the z2 par-
ity, the elds transform as (x5) 7 (x5), where the parity assignments of the
bosonic elds are given in table 1. the orbifold projection keeps only those eld
congurations that are even under z2.

we assume that there are elds localized on the orbifold boundaries, so these must

be coupled to sugra. the lagrangian has the form

l5 = lsugra,5 + (x5)lvis + (x5  r)lhid.

(2.2)

we will not need the details of the bulk-boundary couplings in lvis and lhid, but it
is important for us to know that such couplings exist and preserve n = 1 susy. as
shown in ref. [14] for 5-dimensional gauge- and hypermultiplets, the couplings of bulk
and boundary elds can be worked out in a straightforward fashion if the auxiliary
elds of the bulk theory are known. building on earlier work [15], an explicit o-shell
formulation for 5-dimensional sugra was recently given by zucker [16]. following
ref. [14], one rst decomposes the 5-dimensional sugra multiplet into o-shell

multiplets of the unbroken 4-dimensional n = 1 susy. in addition to the n = 1
sugra multiplet, this yields two vector multiplets (with vector elds g5 and b)
with odd orbifold parity, and one chiral multiplet (with real scalar elds g55 and b5)
with even parity. it should then be possible to couple these multiplets to n = 1 elds
localized on the boundaries using the usual n = 1 supereld calculus.

2.2 matching to 4 dimensions

4  1/(rm 3

we now consider integrating out the kk modes of the 5-dimensional sugra mul-
tiplet at the scale r to obtain a 4-dimensional eective theory. we are interested in
eects of order 1/m 2
5 ), which means that we can restrict attention to tree-
level eects in the sugra elds. (in the normalization of the sugra elds given in
eq. (2.1), the propagator for all bosonic sugra elds is of order 1/m 3
5 .) there are
sugra loop eects suppressed by additional powers of 1/(m5r)3  1/(m4r)2. for
some values of r these eects could be interesting [2]. here we will simply assume
that r is suciently large that these loop eects can be neglected. the matching of
the sugra elds at tree-level is performed simply by using the metric

ds2 = g(x)dxdx + r2(x)d2,

(2.3)
where   [0, ] is a coordinate for the compact dimension, and g(x), r(x) param-
eterize the massless metric and radius modulus elds. (we are implicitly expanding
about a at metric, so the zero-mass kk modes are independent of .)
ignoring
the boundary elds for the moment, the bosonic terms in the 4-dimensional eective
theory are

l4 = 2m 3

1
2r

bb(cid:21) .

(2.4)

note that there is no explicit kinetic term for the radius modulus. after an r-
dependent weyl rescaling of the metric, a kinetic term for the radius modulus is

5qg(4)(cid:20) r

2r(4) +

5

generated (with the correct sign). the couplings of the radius modulus to boundary
elds is very dierent in the two bases. before weyl rescaling, there are no couplings
of r to boundary elds at leading order in the low-energy expansion. this is because
r arises from uctuations of g55, which by general covariance can only couple to the
55 component of the matter stress tensor. this component vanishes for matter con-
ned to 3-branes, at leading order in 1/m5. at higher order in derivatives and 1/m5,
we can write terms containing the curvature tensor that depend on derivatives of r
but these will be a small correction. in the rescaled basis the radius modulus has
non-derivative couplings to elds localized on the branes.

eq. (2.4) is to be matched to the most general lagrangian describing 4-dimensional
sugra coupled to a modulus t . using the superconformal approach to sugra [17],
this can be written as

where

lsugra,4 = z d4  f (t , t ).

 = 1 + 2f

(2.5)

(2.6)

is the conformal compensator. we do not include a superpotential in eq. (2.5) because
t has no potential in this approximation. (recall that we are not including a bulk
cosmological constant.) after integrating out the auxiliary elds, the bosonic terms
of eq. (2.5) are

lsugra,4 = qg(4)" 1

6

1
4f

(ft t  h.c.)(ft t  h.c.)

fr(4) 
 ft t t t + fermion terms#,

(2.7)

where ft = f /t , etc. an important point is that eq. (2.7) must be matched to
eq. (2.4) without weyl rescaling. the reason is that if boundary elds are included,
the theory expressed in terms of the weyl-rescaled metric contains only non-derivative
couplings to the radius modulus. kahler terms involving both t and boundary terms
necessarily contain derivative interactions of t , the only consistent way to match is
if the kahler terms are t -independent. eq. (2.4) then shows that there is an explicit
kinetic term for only one of the real scalar elds in t , so we must have ft t  0.
this implies that f is the sum of a holomorphic plus antiholomorphic function, so we
can make a eld redenition so that f = m 3
5  (t + t ). writing t = t1 + it2, we
have
5 z d4  (t + t )

lsugra,4 = m 3

(2.9)

comparing this with eq. (2.4), we can identify

re(t ) = 3r,

im(t ) = 6b.

(2.10)

eq. (2.8) has the no-scale form considered long ago [18]. the essential new ingredient
in the present case is that the no-scale form is stable under radiative corrections
because the cuto of the 4-dimensional theory is of order 1/r  m4.

we now consider the elds localized on the orbifold boundaries. we are particu-
larly interested in contact interactions between the hidden and visible sectors. the
only contact interaction of order 1/m 2
4 in the 4-dimensional eective theory that is
not forbidden by symmetries is

m 2

4 z d4 ()(qq) =

(q)(  q) +   

(2.11)

where we have explicitly shown the 4-fermion component. the only diagrams that
can contribute to the 4-fermion term in eq. (2.11) at order 1/m 2
4 consist of tree-level
exchange of bosonic sugra elds. the bulk-boundary couplings cannot involve any
suppression by 1/m5, otherwise the nal result will be less than 1/m 2
4 . it may appear
that these conclusions are invalidated by power-divergent loop graphs with a cuto
of order m5. however, general renormalization theory tells us that the divergent
contributions will have the same structure as local terms in the eective eld theory,
and therefore do not give new eects.

now, the exchange of kaluza-klein excitations of the graviton couple to deriva-
tives of the fermion elds and therefore cannot yield a term of the form eq. (2.11).
couplings of the graviphoton to boundary elds are restricted by the orbifold projec-
tion and graviphoton gauge invariance

bm = m ,

(x5) = (x5).

(2.12)

boundary elds cannot be charged under this symmetry because b vanishes on the
boundary. the only term consistent with these constraints that can give rise to the
4-fermion term in eq. (2.11) has the form

l5 = (x5)h5k 

vis + (x5  r)h5k 

hid

(2.13)

where k  is a dimension-3 current constructed from boundary elds; its precise form
will be determined by matching to the 4-dimensional theory.

7

the power-counting argument above shows that eq. (2.13) will give rise to con-
tact terms of order 1/m 2
4 from tree-level exchange of b elds. we can determine
these terms by integrating out b using its classical equations of motion. imposing
periodicity and consistency with the orbifold projection, we obtain

5b =

m 3

5 (cid:20)(y)k 

vis + (y  r)k 

hid

2r

(kvis + khid)(cid:21) .

(2.14)

in this computation it was important that we considered the b eld to be inde-
pendent of x5, corresponding to the zero-mode (imt ) of the ve-dimensional eld.
substituting back into the lagrangian and integrating over the compact dimension to
obtain the 4-dimensional eective theory, we obtain the contact terms3

l4 =

(kvis + khid)(kvis + khid). (2.15)

we compare this with the contact terms in the 4-dimensional sugra with matter
elds:

l4 = z d4 hm 3

5 (t + t ) + fvis + fhidi .

(2.16)

as argued above, fvis and fhid are independent of t because any dependence would
imply a coupling of r (and hence g55) to brane elds (without weyl rescaling). we
therefore obtain

l4 =

j  = i(faa  h.c.) + f a

where f a

b = 2f /(

ab), etc.

(2.17)

(2.18)

comparing eqs. (2.15) and (2.17) and using eq. (2.10), we see that matching the

bk  term requires

k  =

1
6

j .

(2.19)

with this identication, the j j contact terms also match. this matching would be
spoiled by additional contact terms of the form eq. (2.11), so we conclude that these
operators are absent in the 4-dimensional eective theory.

3this procedure also gives rise to terms proportional to (0)  (k 2

vis + k 2

hid) in the 4-dimensional

eective theory; these are cancelled by boundary terms proportional to (0) in the 5-dimensional

theory. for a discussion of the origin of these terms, see refs. [7, 14].

8

putting together the various pieces, the four-dimensional eective theory below

the compactication scale has the general form,

l4 = m 3

5 z d4  (t + t ) + lhid + lvis,

(2.20)

where lhid is made out of only hidden sector and four-dimensional supergravity (o-
shell) multiplets and lvis is made out of only visible sector and four-dimensional
supergravity multiplets. both are independent of the t chiral multiplet.

2.3 the role of the radius

we now consider susy breaking on the hidden-sector boundary in the theory above.
we will show that the presence of an unstabilized radius modulus gives rise to severe
diculties in this scenario when susy is broken in the hidden sector.

independently of how susy is broken, it is easy to see from eq. (2.20) that the ft
equation of motion sets f = 0. this implies that there are no contact terms between
the visible and hidden sectors in this theory, consistent with the fact that there is no
propagating bulk scalar eld in the sugra multiplet that could mediate such terms.
this makes it rather mysterious how susy breaking can be communicated from the
hidden to the visible sector [9], especially since f is the order parameter for amsb
in the visible sector [2, 3].

this feature also gives rise to diculties in cancelling the cosmological constant.
susy breaking on the hidden-sector boundary gives rise to a nonzero vacuum energy
independent of the radius modulus t . in generic four-dimensional sugra models
this positive contribution to the cosmological constant can be cancelled by negative
sugra contributions arising from f 6= 0, but this mechanism is clearly not available
here. one can attempt to remedy this by adding a susy-preserving ve-dimensional
cosmological constant to the theory. to linear order in the cosmological constant, the
eect of this is to add a superpotential term linear in t to eq. (2.20). the potential
arising from this theory is now

v = 

k
m 3
5

re(t ) + vhid,

(2.21)

where vhid0 is the vacuum energy from hidden sector susy breaking, and k0 sets
the size of the bulk cosmological constant. however, this introduces a new problem,
namely runaway behavior for the radius modulus.4 we see that we cannot obtain an

4when t becomes suciently large, the linearized approximation for the eect of a bulk cosmo-

logical constant is no longer valid. we have checked that including the full non-linear eects does

not stop the runaway behavior.

9

appropriate setting for amsb without adding new physics to stabilize the modulus.

we mention that another means of breaking susy is to not have a hidden sector
which breaks susy by itself but rather to simply have a constant superpotential on a
brane (and no bulk cosmological constant). then one nds that ft 6= 0, but f = 0,
so susy is broken but the cosmological constant vanishes. this is the basic no-scale
mechanism of susy breaking [18]. we do not pursue this scenario here because it
involves the vanishing of the amsb order parameter f.

3 radius stabilization

we now show that the problems found above are solved by dynamically stabilizing the
modulus. this modulus must be stabilized in any case for phenomenological reasons.
(the radius modulus must have a mass larger than of order 1 cm1 to avoid conict
with post-newtonian tests of gravity [19].) we will focus on a specic mechanism for
stabilizing the radius modulus that requires only a super-yangmills (sym) sector
in the bulk, and another sym sector on one of the boundaries. we assume that the
bulk cosmological constant is negligible; this is natural because of the presence of
bulk susy.

3.1 bulk super-yangmills

we begin by discussing the bulk sym sector. at the compactication scale 1/r, this
theory matches onto a 4-dimensional sym theory with a gauge coupling that depends
on r. the scale where the eective 4-dimensional sym theory becomes strong there-
fore depends on r, and gaugino condensation generates a dynamical superpotential
that depends on the modulus t . the fact that the dynamical superpotential for t
is generated by supersymmetric dynamics rather than induced by susy breaking in
the hidden sector allows the mass of the modulus to be large compared to m3/2. this
means that below the scale of the radius modulus, the eective theory has the se-
questered form discussed in ref. [2], and the leading contribution to susy breaking
in the visible sector comes from anomaly mediation.

the bulk sym multiplet consists of a vector eld am , a real scalar , and a
symplectic majorana gaugino j (j = 1, 2). these elds are taken to transform under
the orbifold projection as shown in table 2. the even elds form an n = 1 sym
multiplet v, while the odd elds form an n = 1 chiral multiplet . these elds
can be coupled to the boundary elds using the usual rules for constructing n = 1
invariants. (for more details, see ref. [14].)

we assume that the elds on the boundaries are uncharged under the bulk sym
sector. however, there are in general higher-dimension operators coupling the bulk
sym elds to the boundary elds. using a normalization of the elds where the
gauge coupling is factored out of the kinetic terms

the bulk sym propagator is proportional to g2
5  1/m5. therefore, exchange of sym
elds between the boundaries can give rise to contact terms of order 1/m 2
4  1/(rm 3
5 )
only if there are boundary couplings of order 1/m5. however, it is easy to see that
no such terms are possible unless there is a singlet s on the boundary, in which case
we can write

l5 = (y)z d2

m5

s tr(w w) + h.c.,

(3.2)

where w  is the eld strength of the n = 1 sym eld v. (note that boundary
couplings involving the n = 1 chiral multiplet  are restricted by gauge invariance
 = i5, (x5) = +(x5).) if there are singlets in both the hidden and visible
sector, this will induce contact terms between them only at the 1-loop level, and the
presence of two sym propagators in the leading diagram means that the eects are
suppressed by 1/m 4
5 , and therefore negligible. (the contact terms are kahler terms
by u(1)r invariance.) we conclude that introducing the bulk sym sector does not
introduce new contact terms into the eective 4-dimensional theory.

we now construct the 4-dimensional eective theory for the bulk sym sector.
when we perform the kk decomposition, the odd elds have kk masses starting at
1/r, and are therefore integrated out. the even elds have a massless zero mode,
which becomes a 4-dimensional sym sector in the eective theory. the tree-level
matching condition for the eective 4-dimensional gauge coupling is

the logarithmic dependence on t implies that 1/g2
4  re(s) depends on im(t )  b.
but from the 5-dimensional theory we know that b is derivatively coupled, so this is
impossible. it is easy to see that the only way to avoid this contradiction consistent
with holomorphy is eq. (3.4). we have also checked that carefully evaluating the
threshold corrections due to the innite tower of sym kk states also reproduces
eq. (3.4). the dynamical scale of the theory is therefore

(3.7)

in order to obtain believable numerical estimates we need to estimate the constant
of proportionality in eq. (3.7). this can be done using nave dimensional analysis
(nda) [21, 22].5 the principle of nda is that in a strongly-coupled theory with
no small parameters, both the fundamental and the eective theory become strongly
coupled (in the sense that loop corrections are order 1) at the same scale. to estimate
, note that nda implies that if the gauge coupling and the radius are chosen so
that the fundamental theory is strongly-coupled at a scale 0, then   0. the
strong-coupling value of the 5-dimensional gauge coupling is

where 5 = 243 is the (inverse of the) 5-dimensional loop counting parameter, and
we have taken into account the n dependence appropriate for the large n limit. the
strong-coupling value of the radius is where the kk modes have mass of order 0:

r|strong =

(3.9)

this implies that the strong-coupling value of the exponential in eq. (3.7) is order 1,
and we obtain

using 5 = 243 and 4 = 162, the dimensionless prefactor is 3
however, this estimate depends sensitively on the value used for 5, and should be
regarded as very uncertain. nonetheless, it is clear that the prefactor will be large
unless nda is completely misleading.6

3.2 boundary super-yangmills

in addition to the bulk sym sector, we assume that the theory contains a sym
sector localized on one of the boundaries. as with the bulk sym, we assume that
there are no matter elds charged under the sym gauge group. if this sym sector is
in the hidden sector, there is no danger from avor-violating higher-dimension contact
terms. if it is in the visible sector, the lowest-dimension potentially avor-violating
operator is is

l5  (y)z d4

qq tr(w w) + h.c.,

(3.12)

where w  is the eld strength of the boundary sym multiplet. this gives avor-
violating interactions suppressed by (bdy/m5)3, where bdy is the dynamical scale.
this is negligible for the values of bdy we will be interested in (see below), and we
conclude that the boundary sym sector may be either in the hidden or the visible
sector.

6in this connection, it may be worthwhile to point out that exact results obtained in n = 2

theories spectacularly conrm the expectations of nda [24].

3.3 4-dimensional eective theory

now we are ready to analyze the 4-dimensional eective theory, including all sectors.
below the scale 1/r, the 4-dimensional theory consists of 4-dimensional sugra and
the modulus t coupled to the bulk and boundary sym sectors.
in addition, the
theory contains the visible and hidden sectors, which we do not specify explicitly. we
now write the eective lagrangian below the scales bulk and bdy where the sym
sectors become strong, and below the scale of susy breaking in the hidden sector. in
this regime, the only light elds are the sugra elds, the modulus t , the goldstino
from the susy breaking sector, and the visible sector elds. the eective lagrangian
is

le =  m 3

arise from gaugino condensation in the bulk sym theory; and vhid > 0 is the vacuum
energy generated by the susy breaking sector. we have chosen not to add a 5-
dimensional cosmological constant. the constant c can be chosen real by a u(1)r
rotation, but a is in general complex. the terms omitted in eq. (3.13) contain
the interactions of the visible sector elds and a goldstino from susy breaking in
the hidden sector (which will eventually become the longitudinal components of the
massive gravitino). the terms involving the goldstino can be included using a non-
linear realization of susy coupled to sugra [25], but are not relevant for computing
the eective potential for t ; the same is true for the visible sector interactions.

the superpotential in (3.13) is exact, but the kahler potential contains unknown
4 ) corrections from loop corrections and higher-dimension operators. these

o(1/m 4
will be shown to give small corrections below.

we now turn to the minimization of the scalar potential, neglecting corrections to

the kahler potential. the scalar potential obtained from eq. (3.13) is

v =

1
m 3

5 n(cid:16)3cbaebt + h.c.(cid:17) + bhb(t + t ) + 6i|a|2eb(t +t )o + vhid.

(3.16)

14

note that the rst term is proportional to the boundary sym gaugino condensate.
only the rst term in eq. (3.16) depends on im(t ). minimizing with respect to
im(t ), we obtain the eective potential for t1 = re(t ):

v =

1
m 3

5 n6b|a||c|ebt1 + 2b(bt1 + 3)|a|2e2bt1o + vhid.

(3.17)

the term in brackets is a sum of two dierent exponentials with opposite signs, the
negative sign in the rst term arising from the minimization with respect to im(t ).
as t1   the rst term dominates, and the potential approaches +vhid from below.
provided the second term dominates for small t1 there will be a nontrivial minimum
with vacuum energy below +vhid. this means that the parameters can be adjusted
to give a vanishing cosmological constant.

we look for a minimum with bht1i  1. explicitly carrying out the minimization

we nd that

where we have neglected terms suppressed by powers of 1/(bht1i). note that ht1i

suppression factors also tend to increase ht1i.) the vacuum energy at the minimum

where the primes denote dierentiation with respect to t1. the kinetic term for

physical mass of the radius modulus is

it is easy to see that the other real scalar and the fermion component of t also get a
mass of this order. comparing with eq. (3.21), we see that

mr
m3/2  bhri  1.

(3.24)

since the modulus is heavy we can integrate it out of our eective theory. the dif-
ferent component elds in t have mass dierences of order mr, so this is not an
approximately supersymmetric threshold; also it is easy to see that ft does not
vanish (hfti  hrihfi). however, t couples to visible sector only through higher-
dimension derivative interactions (recall that the modulus is the zero-mode of the
ve-dimensional graviton polarized transverse to the branes), so this does not give
a contribution to susy breaking in the visible sector at order 1/m 2
4 . we conclude
that at order 1/m 2
4 , the eective theory below the modulus mass is precisely the
sequestered form proposed in ref. [2]: the visible sector is coupled only to a geo-
metrically at four-dimensional sugra background with broken susy (f 6= 0).

we now return to the question of the corrections to the kahler potential in
eq. (3.13). the kahler potential contains unknown o(1/m 4
4 ) corrections from loop
corrections and higher-dimension operators, and one might worry that these are more
important than the exponentially (in t ) suppressed eects in the superpotential. this
does not occur because the potential vanishes in the limit where the superpotential
vanishes, so the kahler corrections enter multiplicatively. this ensures the stability
of the results above, in that the kahler corrections to the modulus potential are of
order 1/(rm5) smaller than the leading potential we computed.

we now show that this scenario for radius stabilization can give rise to a suciently
large radius without introducing small numbers or ne tuning. from eq. (3.18), the
stabilized value of the radius is

(3.25)

because the radius depends logarithmically on the fundamental parameters, we can-
not obtain hierarchies of many orders of magnitude. in fact, because of the factor

16

1/5  103 multiplying the logarithm in eq. (3.25), the bulk sym gauge coupling
g5 must be large, and the fundamental theory must be close to strongly coupling.

the simplest assumption is that both gravity and the bulk sym sector become
strong at a single scale 0. nda gives 0  (5)1/3m5  10m5, and we will take
this scale to be the fundamental scale of the theory (e.g. the scale of string/m-theory
excited states). using the nda estimates for 0 and g2

(3.28)

this gives a contribution to soft scalar mass-squared terms of order hfi2/(0r)3 
(600 gev)2, which is comparable to the contribution from anomaly mediation!
it
is interesting that this mechanism for radius stabilization can naturally stabilize the
radius at a value where loop eects are important. this may give a solution to the
problem of negative slepton masses, but we will not pursue this point here.

another possibility is that the bulk sym sector becomes strong at a scale gauge
that is smaller than the scale grav. here, gauge is a fundamental scale of new strong
physics, while grav is not directly a physical scale, but corresponds to a weak gravita-
tional coupling at the fundamental scale gauge. this occurs naturally if the gauge in-
teractions propagate in fewer dimensions than gravity in the fundamental theory. for
gauge/grav  1
10 , we obtain rgrav  160. this is sucient to suppress gravitational
loop eects, and also suppresses avor-changing contributions from string/m-theory
states at the scale gauge. we have also checked that the contact terms from bulk
gauge elds are negligible. these estimates are quite rough, but we conclude that
it is very plausible that this mechanism can give a suciently large radius so that
anomaly mediation dominates.

4 conclusions

we have studied a ve-dimensional model with brane-localized visible and hidden
sectors localized on 3-branes and shown that when the compactication radius is

17

properly stabilized, the transmission of supersymmetry breaking to the visible sec-
tor proceeds by the mechanism of anomaly-mediation. although the radius modulus
participates strongly in the supersymmetry breaking, it does not contribute to soft
visible sector masses at order 1/m 2
4 because it does not directly couple to the vis-
ible brane. the stabilization mechanism for the radius modulus employed in this
paper is very simple, involving gaugino condensates in the bulk and on a brane.
the bulk gauge elds do not give additional contributions to visible soft masses due
to the constraints of gauge invariance. the advantage of this mechanism is that it
gives a non-perturbative superpotential for the modulus arising from eld-theoretic
mechanisms that are under theoretical control. it is also possible that that such a
superpotential could also arise from non-perturbative string/m-theory eects due to
extended states.

this work is evidence that anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking gives a
model-independent contribution to soft supersymmetry breaking in the visible sector
at order 1/m 2
4 in any model with susy breaking on a hidden-sector brane, and stabi-
lized moduli. if there are no additional light bulk elds that give a larger contribution,
anomaly-mediation dominates, giving a natural solution to the supersymmetric avor
problem as well as potentially testable predictions. these features can be upset by
the presence of additional bulk elds with signicant couplings to the visible sector.7
knowledge of the true string theory vacuum, or experiment, is required to nd out if
such light non-minimal bulk elds are present.
