abstract

we study two-dimensional sqed viewed as the world-volume theory of a d-string
in the presence of d5-branes with non-zero background elds that induce attractive
forces between the branes.
in various approximations, the low-energy dynamics is
given by a hyperkahler, or hyperkahler with torsion, massive sigma-model. we
demonstrate the existence of kink solutions corresponding to the string interpolating
between dierent d5-branes. bound states of the d-string with fundamental strings
are identied with q-kinks which, in turn, are identied with dyonic instanton strings
on the d5-brane world-volume.

1 introduction

supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges generically posses a classical
moduli space of vacua. moreover non-renormalisation theorems prohibit the dynami-
cal generation of a potential on this space by either perturbative or non-perturbative
eects and the moduli space survives in the full quantum theory, albeit possibly
diering from the classical space in its metric and singularity structure.
indeed,
the existence of such quantum moduli spaces has been of paramount importance
in determining many properties of the low-energy dynamics of theories with eight
supercharges in two, three and four dimensions.

however there are situations where, despite the existence of eight supercharges,
the classical theory has only isolated vacua. part of the motivation of the present
paper is to investigate to what extent the low-energy dynamics of these theories
can be described in terms of a potential on a quantum vacuum moduli space. we
consider the simplest such model: two dimensional n = (4, 4) sqed. as will be
reviewed in section 2, the introduction of both fayet-iliopoulos (fi) parameters and
hypermultiplet masses leads to a situation with only isolated vacua and, in dierent
approximations, the low-energy dynamics is described as a massive sigma-model on
dierent branches of the vacuum moduli space.

further motivation comes from string theory where there exist brane congura-
tions preserving eight supercharges that again have only isolated vacua. one such
situation in type iib theory has been described recently by bergshoe and townsend
[1]. these authors consider a (1, 1)-string (i.e. a bound state of a d-string with a
fundamental (f-)string) lying parallel to k separated d5-branes. as is well known,
the d1-d5 system preserves 1/4 of the spacetime supersymmetry, implying no force
between a d-string and d5-brane. however, the f-string, and therefore the (1, 1)-
string under consideration, is attracted to the d5-branes. the result is a situation
with k isolated vacua corresponding to each of the possible (1, 1)-string/d5-brane
bound states. moreover, in each of these vacua eight supercharges are again pre-
served. bergshoe and townsend further showed that there should exist stable, bps,
kink congurations in which the (1, 1)-string interpolates between two d5-branes as
shown in gure 1. these solutions were identied with the t-duals of q-kinks [2, 3].

there exist related scenarios which capture the same physics. for instance, consider
the two-dimensional u(1) world-volume gauge theory of a d-string. the (1, 1)-string
bound-state corresponds to the introduction of a single quantised unit of eld strength
[4]. from this perspective it is the non-zero world-volume electric eld which leads
to an attraction between the string and d5-branes. however one need not consider
a full quantum of electric eld. it was shown many years ago that the appearance

1

figure 1: the kinky string: such soliton solutions exist whenever the string forms a bound
state with the d5-branes. this can be acheived either by considering a (1, 1)-string, or by
considering a d-string in the presence of constant background rr scalar or ns-ns two
form.

of an unquantised, constant, electric eld in two-dimensions can be interpreted as
the addition of a -angle to the lagrangian [5]. this in turn corresponds to the d1-
d5 system in the presence of a constant background ramond-ramond (rr) scalar
eld, c0, as can be seen by considering the wess-zumino terms which couple a at

dp-brane to the bulk rr potential, c = pn c1ndx1      dxn

sw.z. = zrp+1

c  ef .

(1)

here f = f  b/2 where f is the gauge eld strength, b is the pull back of the
bulk ns-ns two-form potential, and  is the inverse string tension. this situation
will prove somewhat easier to discuss from the gauge theory point of view and we will
show in section 3 that it does indeed lead to an attractive force between the string
and d5-branes as claimed.

in fact there is a second way to attract a d-string and d5-brane: one may turn on
a constant magnetic eld on the d5-brane world-volume in directions orthogonal to
the string. let the d-string have world-volume x0, x1 and the d5-brane have world-
volume x0,   , x5. we will ultimately be interested in turning on a constant self-dual
eld strength fij, i, j = 2, 3, 4, 5, on the d5-brane (see next section) and vanishing
eld strength on the d-string.
in order to see how this leads to a force between
the string and ve-brane, consider the bosonic terms in the action for an f-string

2

stretched between them,

s =

1

4 z dd nx x  + bx x o +z d a

dx 
d

,

(2)

where   [0, ] is the spatial coordinate of the open string and the second term is
evaluated at the boundary consisting of the two end points on the d-string ( = 0)
and the d5-brane ( = ). the standard free eld equations of motion are obtained
from varying the action (2). however the resulting boundary term for the bosons is
modied to

1

2 z d x (cid:16)x  + 2f 

 x (cid:17)  .

(3)

thus while dirichlet (d) boundary conditions (x  = 0) are consistent, we no longer
have pure neumann (n) boundary conditions but rather

x  + 2f 

 x  = 0 .

(4)

for our current situation, only elds with dn boundary conditions are aected,
namely x 2, x 3, x 4, x 5 and their fermionic partners. it is a staightforward exercise
to see that the modings of the elds are now shifted from the standard half-integer
moding for the bosons (and the corresponding integer or half-integer moding for the
fermions in the ns and r sectors respectively). we now nd two bosonic elds with
moding  + n and two bosonic elds with moding  + n. here n  z and

tan2() =

1

22f 2 ,

(5)

where 0 <   1/2. similarly the fermions in the ns and r sectors are shifted from
these modings by 1/2 and 0 respectively. in particular, this leads to a tachyonic ns
ground state from the dn sector, and the one loop open string amplitude for the
potential between the d-branes [7] no longer enjoys the cancellation between the ns
and r sectors arising from jacobis abstruse identity, thus leading to an attractive
force between the branes. in fact, this calculation is essentially the same as for the
force between moving d-branes performed in [8]. note that if the same eld strength
is introduced at both ends of an open string, then the moding is not altered and the
various forces cancel. so in particular there is still no force between the d5-branes.

in summary, a force between the d-string and d5-branes may be generated by
turning on either of the constant background elds, c0 or bij. as will be reviewed
in the following section, both of these spacetime background elds have a simple in-
terpretation as parameters of the d-string world-volume theory. in the remainder of
the paper, we will examine the physics of this system. the following section reviews

3

the the n = (4, 4) u(1) gauge theory that describes the low-energy dynamics of the
d-string. for certain parameters, the theory has only isolated vacua corresponding
to d-string/d5-brane bound states described above. we further demonstrate the
existence of bps soliton solutions of the classical equations of motion, although un-
fortunately we are unable to solve the bogomolnyi equation in general for this case.
in the remaining two sections we consider two dierent approximations in which
the low-energy dynamics reduces to a massive supersymmetric sigma-model on the
coulomb and higgs branches respectively. the former description is unfortunately
rather sick as the d-string is forced down the throat of the ve-brane metric where
the approximation breaks down and the physics is badly understood. nevertheless,
we are able to solve for the kinky d-string solutions in this case. the higgs branch
description is better behaved. moreover, in this approximation we nd a three-way
identication between d-string/f-string bound states, q-kinks [2] and dyonic instan-
ton strings [9]. we also give a t-dualised description of the higgs branch where the
q-kink momenta are exchanged in favour of winding modes [3].

2 the model

we will be interested in the limit of innite planck mass to ensure the suppression of
the kinetic terms for the bulk closed string elds. in addition, the limit of vanishing
string length,   0, allows us to ignore the higher order born-infeld interactions,
and the d-brane dynamics reduces to a gauge theory. the conguration of d-string
and d5-branes described in the introduction breaks ten-dimensional lorentz invari-
ance to,

spin(1, 9)  spin(1, 1)  spin(4)r  su(2)r ,

(6)

where spin(1, 1) is the lorentz group of the two-dimensional world-volume theory of
the d-string, spin(4)r describes the unbroken rotation group in x6, x7, x8, x9, trans-
verse to the d5-branes, and su(2)r describes self-dual rotations in the remaining
directions tangent to the d5-brane, x2, x3, x4, x5. the full spin(4) symmetry ro-
tating these directions is not realised due to the orientation of the d-branes; had
we considered anti-d5-branes, then the anti-self-dual rotations would have been re-
alised. the d1-d5 system breaks 1/4 of the spacetime supersymmetries, resulting in
a n = (4, 4) theory in two dimensions.

the eective action for the d-string is determined by quantization of open strings
with ends terminating on the d-string. those that have both end points on the d-
string yield a n = (4, 4) vector multiplet, also known as a twisted multiplet, and a
neutral n = (4, 4) hypermultiplet. two complex scalars in the latter parametrise the
position of the d-string in the x2, x3, x4, x5 plane. for a single d-string, these decouple

4

and we shall ignore them for the remainder of the paper. the vector multiplet contains
two further complex, neutral, scalars,  and , parametrising the position of the d-
string in the directions x6, x7, x8, x9 transverse to the d5-branes. the superpartners
of these scalars are a two-dimensional gauge potential, a, together with two dirac
fermions,  and , which are uncharged under the gauge group. the vector mulitplet
may be decomposed into an n = (2, 2) gauge multiplet, v , and chiral multiplet, ,
with

{a, , , d}  v

and

{, , f}   ,

where d and f are the usual real and complex auxiliary elds respectively. the
eld strength of v is an n = (2, 2) twisted chiral multiplet,  = d+dv , which
has complex auxiliary eld d  if01, where f01 is the u(1) eld strength. detailed
conventions of n = (2, 2) multiplets may be found in [10].

the presence of the d5-branes means that we must also consider open strings with
one end point on the d-string and the other on one of the k d5-branes. these give rise
to k charged hypermultiplets, with the gauge coupling constant given by e2 = gs/.
each of these hypermultiplets is composed of two n = (2, 2) chiral multiplets, qi
and qi, i = 1,   k, each containing a complex scalar qi (qi), a dirac fermion, i ( i)
and a complex auxiliary eld fi ( fi). all elds in qi transform with charge +1 under
the u(1) gauge group, while those in qi transform with charge 1.

the lagrangian for k massless hypermultiplets coupled to a u(1) vector multiplet

is given by l = ld + lf, where
ld = z d4 ( 1

4e2 (cid:16)  (cid:17) +

and

xi=1(cid:16) qi exp(2v ) qi + qi exp(2v ) qi(cid:17)) ,(7)

lf = z d2 (2

(8)

the theory has a h = spin(4)r  su(2)r  su(k) global symmetry group, where
the rst two terms in the product are r-symmetries, and the latter is the avour
symmetry. the vector multiplet scalars,  and , transform in the (4, 1, 1) of h
while the hypermultiplet scalars, qi and qi, transform as (1, 3 + 1, k).

there are further parameters that we may add to the lagrangian. the existence
of two complex mass parameters consistent with supersymmetry follows from the
existence of the two complex scalars in the vector multiplet, each of which may induce

5

a mass term for a hypermultiplet by the higgs mechanism. from the string picture,
the total mass (bare plus higgs) of a hypermultiplet is determined by the distance
from the d-string to the d5-brane, and the resulting mass parameters transform
as (4, 1, k  k) under h. the complex matrix mij appears in the lagrangian as a
hypermultiplet dependent vacuum expectation value (vev) for  and is referred to
simply as the complex mass,

+ h.c. .

we will work in a avour basis in which the complex mass matrix is diagonal, mij =

miij (no sum over i) and with pi mi = 0. the second mass parameter is equivalent
to a hypermultiplet dependent vev for , and is known as the twisted mass. in the
diagonal avour basis, it may be incorporated in the above lagrangian by gauging
the cartan sub-algebra of the su(k) avour symmetry in a n = (2, 2) invariant
fashion, thus introducing k  1 new gauge superelds, vi, i = 1, ..., k, with pi vi = 0,
and with corresponding eld strengths i. the hypermultiplet kinetic terms of (7)
are now given by the substitution,

v  v + vi ,

(10)

and a lagrange multiplier is employed to restrict the complex scalar eld that resides
within vi to equal the twisted mass, denoted mi,

ll.m. = z d2 (cid:26) i

2

i(i  mi)(cid:27) + h.c. ,

(11)

where the measure d2 denotes integration over the twisted half of superspace. each
lagrange multiplier, i, is a twisted chiral supereld. these will play a prominent
role in the t-duality of the higgs branch discussed in section four. by construction,

we have pi mi = 0.

finally, two dimensional abelian gauge theories with eight supercharges also allow
for the possibility of a dimensionless theta angle, , and three dimensionless fi param-
eters,  = (1, 2, 3). the former is a singlet under h, and we have already discussed
its interpretation in the string theory: it corresponds to turning on a constant back-
ground rr scalar, as seen in (1). the fi parameters transform as (1, 3 + 1, 1) under
h. the fi parameters and theta-angle may be considered as vacuum expectation
values of a background hypermultiplet. this fact, together with their transformation
under h, is sucient to identify their ten-dimensional spacetime interpretation and
they correspond to a constant, background, self-dual ns-ns two form potential in
the directions x2, x3, x4, x5 [11],

where a are the self-dual t hooft matrices. both fi parameters and the theta angle
may be incorporated in the lagrangian as (twisted) f-terms,

lf = z d2 w () +z d2 w() + h.c. .

(13)

the superpotential w () =  /2 and the twisted superpotential w = i /2 depend
upon the complexied combinations  = i3 + /2 and  = 1 + i2. the eect of
fi-parameters and theta angle on the d1/d5-system were also considered yesterday
in a slightly dierent context [12].

we turn now to the vacuum moduli space of the theory. the classical potential

energy, obtained by eliminating all auxiliary elds, is given by

the structure of the classical vacuum moduli space, u = 0, is dependent upon the
values of the fi and mass parameters. we deal with each case in turn.

i) mi = mi =  = 0:

this case corresponds to zero background ns-ns two form ux and coincident d5-
branes. there exist two branches of vacua: the coulomb branch and the higgs branch.
the coulomb branch has qi = qi = 0, while the vevs of  and  are unconstrained,
reecting the fact that the d-string may roam the x6, x7, x8, x9 directions transverse
to the d5-branes unimpeded. the metric on this space is the ve-brane metric of
[13] and will be reviewed in the following section. on the higgs branch however,
 =  = 0 while qi and qi are constrained only by the rst three terms in (14). these
constraints coincide with the adhm equations for a single u(k) instanton, resulting
in a hyperkahler quotient construction of a 4(k1) dimensional space of vacua which
coincides with the 1 instanton moduli space. in the string theory interpretation, the
d-string is absorbed by the d5-branes, where it appears as a single u(k) instanton
[6], as is apparant from (1).

ii) mi 6= mj or mi 6= mj for i 6= j, and  = 0:

this corresponds to the separation of the d5-branes. the higgs branch is now lifted
as a single d5-brane is unable to absorb a d-string (there are no nite action u(1)
instantons).
in section 4 we shall quantify the lifting of this moduli space for the
simplest example of k = 2. in fact, the lifting in more complicated cases, including

7

multiple d5-branes and multiple d-strings, has been well understood for many years
from the perspective of instanton calculus with spontaneously broken gauge groups.
see for example [14].

iii) mi = mi = 0, and  6= 0:

the d5-branes remain coincident, but a non-zero constant background ns-ns two
form ux is turned on (12). the higgs branch remains and coincides with the moduli
space of a single u(k) instanton on non-commutative r4 [15]. the coulomb branch is
lifted, reecting the attraction between the d-string and d5-branes as expected from
the discussion in the introduction. in the following section, we quantify the lifting of
the coulomb branch.

iv) mi 6= mj or mi 6= mj for i 6= j, and  6= 0:

the d5-branes are separated, the ns-ns two form ux is turned on, and the d-string
has only k isolated vacuum states given by

 = mi

 =  mi

;

iai = a

no sum over i

(15)

where a are the pauli matrices and we have introduced the su(2)r covariant vectors
i = (qi, qi ). we see from the rst two equations above that each vacuum state occurs
at the position of a d5-brane, corresponding to a d-string/d5-brane bound state.

the theta angle has, of course, played no role in the above discussion.

in the
following section we shall integrate out all hypermultiplets, after which the u(1) eld
strength, f01, will play the role of an auxiliary eld and we shall nd that  lifts the
coulomb branch in the same fashion as the fi parameters.

let us now restrict attention to the fourth scenario above where, as discussed in the
introduction, we may expect to nd soliton solutions interpolating between two of the
vacua (15), corresponding to the eponymous kinky d-string. in order to simplify the
equations, we consider the case k = 2, and make full use of the su(2)r  spin(4)r
r-symmetry to set  = (0, 0, 3) (with 3 > 0) and m1 = m2 = 0 , m1 =  m2 = i
(for real ). it is clear that a full su(2)r  spin(4)r multiplet of bps solitons must
exist in the complete theory. our search for solitons begins by requiring half of the
(4, 4) supersymmeteries to be preserved. an additional simplication resulting from
the above su(2)rspin(4)r rotation is that now it is sucient to search for solutions
which preserve half of the (2, 2) supersymmetry. in terms of n = (2, 2) superelds,
these supersymmetry transformations take the form

v = (+q + q+)v ,
 = (+q + q+) ,

8

qi = (+q + q+)qi ,
 qi = (+q + q+) qi .

(16)

the component expansions for these expression can be found in [10]. for the case in
hand we nd that, setting the fermion elds to zero, supersymmetry is preserved if
+ = , + =  and the bososnic elds satisfy the rst order equations

(17)

for 3 > 0, we see from (14) that qi has vanishing vev in both vacua and we may
therefore trivially satisfy the last of these equations by qi = 0. we also nd that,
although the bogomolnyi conditions (17) admit solutions with a background electric

eld f01 = x( + )/2, the equations of motion require  = . therefore we set

a = 0 and, after eliminating the auxiliary eld d, we nd the remaining coupled

this indeed describes a soliton solution interpolating between the rst and second
vacua as x ranges from  to + provided  is assigned the boundary conditions

(x)  x as x  

given these boundary conditions, there exists a unique solution for  and the soliton
(19) posseses two collective coordinates. the rst, x0, describes the centre of mass of
the kink. the second, , has period 2 and describes the relative phase between the
two vacua 1.

we have been unable to solve equation (19) explicitly, although for the special case
log(1 + e22x) + x. in general however, since the
2 = e23/4 we nd (x) =  12
boundary conditions select a unique solution for , we expect to nd that the soliton
solution has only the two zero modes x0 and . the low energy eective dynamics of
the soliton are then described by n = 4 quantum mechanics with two bosonic elds.

finally we consider the mass of the kink. the bosonic energy density for the elds

notice that the rst two terms are each positive denite and attain zero when the

given by

e = z

3 on the coulomb branch

in this and the following section, we consider the low-energy dynamics of the theory
in dierent regions of the parameter space and discuss three further avatars of the
kink solitons. one expects that at low-energies the physics is correctly described by
a sigma-model on the classical vacuum moduli space. for mi = mi =  =  = 0
where we have both coulomb and higgs branches, consideration of the action of the
r-symmetries on the scalars suggests that, despite strong coupling uctuations, the
higgs and coulomb branches decouple in the infra-red [16, 17]. here we review the
description of the coulomb branch [17, 18] and describe its lifting by the theta angle
and fi parameters.

we consider rst the situation of arbitrary masses, but with  = 0 and  = 0,
ensuring the survival of the coulomb branch. the classically massless superelds are
the chiral eld  and the twisted chiral eld . up to two derivatives, the most
general theory one can write down consistent with n = (2, 2) supersymmetry is

l = z d4 k(, , , ).

(25)

k is known as a generalised kahler potential. in component form, the bososnic part
of (25) is given by a sigma-model with torsion

lbose = k(  f f )  k(  1
+ k() + k() .

(26)

while (25) is, by construction, invariant under n = (2, 2) supersymmetry, further
restrictions on k are required in order for the lagrangian to respect the full n = (4, 4)
algebra. if k were a function of only chiral superelds, it is well known that it must
give rise to a hyperkahler metric. if however, as in the present case, k is a function
of both chiral and twisted chiral superelds, the condition on k is [19]

k = k .

11

(27)

the resulting metric is not hyperkahler but, rather, hyperkahler with torsion. the
constraint (27), together with the requirement of spin(4)r r-symmetry acting on the
scalars  and  is very restrictive and is sucient to x k up to two constants, which
are determined at tree level and one-loop [20, 18]. the resulting generalised kahler
potential is

k =

e2 (  ) +

k

xi=1(log( + mi) log( + mi ) z xi dx

x

log(x + 1)) , (28)

where the limit of the integral is given by the ratio

xi =

( + mi)( + mi )
( + mi)( + mi )

.

in the absence of a superpotential, the auxiliary elds, as well as the eld strength,
are set to zero by their equations of motion, and the bosonic action (26) has the
target space metric and torsion of k ve-branes [13], with positions at  =  mi and
 = mi, reecting the fact the on the coulomb branch the d-string probes the
directions transverse to the d5-branes. the metric is given by

as is well known, the ve-brane metric has singularities at  = mi,  =  mi,
near which the metric has the form of an innitely long tube. the existence of
singularities on the coulomb branch is of course familiar from examples in three and
four dimensions and is usually indicative of a dual description of the physics.
in
the present situation, no dual description is known - see [17] for a discussion of the
meaning of the singularity.

we turn now to the fate of the coulomb branch with non-zero fi and theta pa-
rameters. these appear in the classical action as a superpotential term (13). the
generalised kahler potential is again fully determined at tree-level and one-loop to
be (28). note that there are no longer any sources for the gauge eld a so we may
treat f01 as an auxiliary eld. now when we eliminate the auxiliary elds by their
equations of motion we obtain a sigma-model on the ve-brane background with a
potential, v , given by

v (, , , ) =

(29)

as expected, the potential has k zeroes at the points  = mi and  =  mi, for each
value of i, each corresponding to a d-string/d5-bound state. moroever, the massive
sigma-model with ve-brane target space and potential (29) is invariant under the
full n = (4, 4) supersymmerty algebra and all eight supercharges are preserved in
each of the vacua. to see this, note that the ve-brane metric admits two sets of
complex structures (ii
j ) which obey the algebra of the quaterions and are
covariantly constant with repect to the connection with torsion k
[13]. furthermore
ij
these complex structures are in fact constant. from this, and using the criteria of
[21], it can be readily veried that this potential does indeed preserve the (4, 4)
supersymmetry of the sigma-model.

notice that the fi paramaters and theta angle are present in (29) in a spin(4) in-
variant fashion. indeed, in [17] it is argued that the su(2)r r-symmetry under which
 transforms as a 3 is enhanced in the infra-red to a second spin(4) r-symmetry.
this eect was demonstrated in [22] using iia intersecting brane constructions of this
theory, the extra dimension arising upon lifting to m-theory.

before progressing, it is important to determine in which limit of the theory the
above description of massive vector multiplet elds is valid. in order to derive the
potential (29), we have performed a one-loop calculation, expanding around congu-
rations which are vacua only when the fi parameters vanish. one must check that
the resulting description of the low-energy dynamics is consistent. naively, we expect
this to be the case for small fi parameters, ||  1. more quantatively, we require
the potential energy of the coulomb branch sigma-model to be less than the mass of
each of the hypermultiplet elds that have been integrated out

(   + 2/42)h1  | + mi|2 + | + mi|2  e2|| ,

where the last term on the right hand side arises from the triplet of d-terms in the
scalar potential (14). in fact, certain hypermultiplet elds that have been integrated
out actually become tachyonic at a radius e2|| from the ve-brane singularity. our
conclusion is therefore that the massive coulomb branch description of the low-energy
dynamics is valid except in a region close to the vacua! however, despite this problem,
we continue in our search for the kinky d-string soliton and are vindicated to some
extent by the existence of a well behaved solution.

in order to exhibit the existence of kink solitons in the coulomb branch we can
form a bound on the energy of a solution. from the hamiltonian we nd the energy
of any conguration is given by

e = z dx nh(tt + tt) + h(xx + xx) + 1

for the simplest situation of two d5-branes, the kink solution describing a d-string
interpolating between the ve-branes is found to be given by  = m1(x) and  =
m1(x), where (x) satises the simple algebraic equation

where, as in the previous section, the integration constant x0 is the centre of mass of
the kink. it is easy to check that the function on the left hand side is monotonically
increasing and can be inverted over the range   (1, 1), x  (,), yielding a
previously unknown kink solution preserving 1/2 of the supersymmetry. the energy
of these solitons is easily determined from (30) to be

e = 2m (cid:16)   + 2/42(cid:17)1/2

.

(31)

notice that, with the exception of the contribution from the -angle, the mass of this
kink is the same as that of the classical soliton (24). the above coulomb branch de-
scription includes quantum corrections however and the conclusion is that the masses

14

of these states are not renormalised. this is in contrast to similar states in the
n = (2, 2) theories [23, 24]. curiously however, and unlike the solutions to the clas-
sical equations of motion described in the previous section, these solitons depend on
only a single bosonic collective coordinate. the periodic collective coordinate de-
scribing the relative phase of the two vacua is missing from the above description.
it appears that this situation has arisen because of the sickness of the model near
the vacua. as a check, one could consider the above u(1) gauge theory with eight
supercharges in three dimensions where the problems associated with the tube metric
do not arise. in this case, the coulomb branch is the k-centered taub-nut metric
[25] with potential given by the length of the tri-holomorphic killing vector. solitons
interpolating between two vacua are now strings in three dimensions and are in fact
q-kinks [2]. similar solitons will appear in the following section and they do indeed
have a second, periodic collective coordinate.

4 on the higgs branch

our starting point in this section is the 4(k  1) dimensional higgs branch which
exists for coincident d5-branes. fluctuations transverse to this space acquire a mass
of order e (the gauge coupling constant) and in the infra-red limit e  , the low-
energy dynamics is well described a sigma-model on the higgs branch. the metric on
this branch receives no quantum corrections and arises as a hyperkahler quotient of
the 4k dimensional space parametrised by the hypermultiplet scalars, qi and qi, with
momentum maps given by the rst three equations of the scalar potential (29). the
three fi parameters correspond to the blow-up modes of the singularities of this space.
in the simplest case of k = 2 with the theta angle set to zero, the four-dimensional
higgs branch is the eguchi-hanson metric (for a derivation of this well-known fact
see, for example, [26])

with

ds2 = g(r)dr  dr + g(r)1(d    dr)2 ,

g(r) =

1

|r  |

+

1
|r|

and    = g .

(32)

(33)

in terms of the hypermultiplet scalars, the coordinates on the metric (32) are given
by r = 11   = 22 (where  denotes the triplet of pauli matrices and i were
dened after equation (15)) and  = 2 arg (q1q2).

we now consider turning on mass terms for the hypermultiplets inducing a potential
on the higgs branch. as in the previous section, the dictates of supersymmetry are
strong enough to determine the form of the potential: it must be proportional to the

15

length of a tri-holomorphic killing vector. an explicit derivation of the potential will
be given later in this section.
in the case of eguchi-hanson, the killing vector is
simply /, and the potential is given by

v (r, ) = m 2g1 .

(34)

once again, the description of the low-energy dynamics in terms of such a model
is valid only if the surviving modes are of lower energy than those that have been
integrated out. for the vector multiplet this requires
e2(|r| + |r  |)  m 2g1 ,

which is acheivable at all points of the higgs branch providing e  m. this de-
scription therefore suers from none of the sickness of the coulomb branch. the
low-energy dynamics is now described by a massive sigma-model with two isolated
vacua at the xed points of the isometry, r = 0 and r = . once again, we expect to
nd soliton solutions interpolating between these two vacua. in fact, the properties
of these solitons have been previously explored by abraham and townsend [2], where
they were christened q-kinks. as we now review, they have a rather unusual prop-
erty for kinks in 2-dimensions: they are dyonic. that is, they have an internal degree
of freedom which may be excited, resulting in a tower of kink-states, analagous to
the tower of dyons that arises when quantising four-dimensional monopole congura-
tions. in fact, it has been shown that for such dyonic kinks in n = (2, 2) models, the
similarity with four-dimensional dyons extends to the bound states and renormalised
masses of these objects [23, 24]. the energy of any classical conguration is given by

e = z dx n(r  r + r  r)g + ((  +   r)2

+ ( +   r)2)g1 + m 2g1o ,

where the dot and prime denote temporal and spatial derivatives respectively. fol-
lowing [2], we further introduce a unit four-vector, (n0, n), such that n2
0 + n  n = 1,
and rewrite the energy by completing the square

e = z dx ngr  r + g1(  +   r  mn0)2

+ g1( +   r)2 + g(cid:16)r  g1m n(cid:17)2
+2(cid:16)g1(  +   r)n0 + r  n(cid:17) mo ,

 2m {q0n0 + q  n} .

the nal expression for the energy bound contains only conserved quantities, namely
the noether charge, q0, and topological charge, q, dened by

q0 = z dx g1  ,

q = z dx r .

16

the bound is clearly maximised by choosing (n0, n)  (q0, q), in which case we have

e2  4m 2(q2

0 + q  q) ,

where the inequality is saturated by the bogomolnyi congurations satisfying, r = 0
and  = 0, together with

 = mn0 ,
r = mg1n .

the solutions to these equations, rst found in [2], are given by

 = 0 + mn0t ,
r = 1

2  tanh(cid:16) 1

2|n|m(x  x0)(cid:17) + 1

2  .

(35)

there is thus a family of soliton solutions parametrised by the angular velocity n0,
each with the two centre of mass collective coordinates, 0 and x0. the periodicity
of 0 ensures that upon quantisation the noether charge q0 will be integer valued
[2]. what is the interpretation of the resulting tower of states in the ten-dimensional
spacetime picture? we claim that they correspond to (1, q0)-strings (that is a bound
state of the d-string with q0 f-strings) that interpolate between the two d5-branes
in the manner described in the introduction. this claries the observation of [1] that
such kinky string should have a description as q-kinks.

in order to elucidate this point, let us examine various properties of the q-kinks.
firstly, we may consider the limit of vanishing fi parameters,  = 0, in which the
eguchi-hanson metric (32) becomes the singular one-instanton moduli space. the
potential now has only a single zero at the singular point r = 0 and the pure kink
solution that carries no noether charge shrinks to this point, reecting the fact that
the spontaneously broken gauge group that lives on the d5-branes cannot support
a non-singular pure instanton solution. however, it was recently shown that non-
singular dyonic instanton string solutions may exist in spontaneously broken gauge
groups if the string also carries electric charge [9]. moreover, the description of these
strings in terms of the instanton moduli space sigma-model is as a solution to the
sigma-model equations of motion which coincides with the   0 limit of the q-kink
solution (35). such strings break 1/4 of the supersymmetry of the six-dimensional
theory on the d5-branes and therefore 1/8 of the 32 space-time supersymmetries.
the only known string-like states with these properties are indeed the (1, q0)-strings
interpolating between the two d5-branes. we note in passing that, using the results of
[15] and [9], the original q-kink solution (35) with  6= 0 describes a dyonic instanton
string whose transverse space is non-commutative r4. moreover, the existence of
a such a soliton with zero electric charge reects the fact that there exist smooth,
non-dyonic, abelian instantons in non-commutative spaces [15].

17

so far our discussion of the higgs branch has been limited to zero theta angle.
as shown in [2] and [23], the inclusion of  induces a torsion on the higgs branch
sigma-model. to see this, consider the infra-red limit e2  , in which the gauge
eld kinetic terms vanish, a satises an algebraic equation of motion which may be
substituted in the theta term

s =



2 z d2x f01 =



4 z d2x bij x ix j ,

(36)

where x i = (r, ). by construction this term is a total derivative and therefore does
not aect the sigma-model equations of motion. however, it does aect the theory
through a shift in the noether charge operator, in analogy with the witten eect in
four-dimensional gauge theories [27]. it is a straightforward task to adapt the analysis
presented in [2] for the inclusion of s to our case. we nd that the charge operator
q0 = q = i/ is now shifted to

q0 = q +



2 z 



dx baxra .

(37)

using the relationship between the (r, ) coordinates of eguchi-hanson and the hy-
permultiplet scalars (qi, qi) (given after equation (33)), we may determine a from
the original action to nd

ba xra = x 

|r|

|r| + |r  |! .

in this way we nd for the q-kink solitons that

q0 = q +


2

.

(38)

(39)

including this eect we recover, for q = 0, the same mass formula (31) that applies
to the solitons on the coulomb branch. the periodicity of  ensures that upon
quantisation q will be integer valued. the shift in the noether charge of the q-
kinks that is induced by  mirrors the eect of background the rr-scalar on the
d-string/f-string bound states, where the allowed background electric eld on the
d-string is shifted from integral values [4]. this supports our interpretation of q-kinks
with (1, q0)-string bound states.

to nd further evidence for this identication, let us consider how these states
transform under t-duality, an operation that one can perform on any two-dimensional
sigma-model with a u(1) isometry. we use the n = (2, 2) supereld duality trans-
formations of rocek and verlinde [28]. t-dualisation of sigma-models with potentials
was discussed in [3], while application of these transformations to higgs branches of

18

theories with four supercharges were considered previously in [24]. our starting point
is the microscopic lagrangian dened in equations (7)-(11). the plan is to exchange
each hypermulitplet, containing two n = (2, 2) chiral superelds of opposite charge,
qi and qi, for a n = (4, 4) twisted multiplet, containing a single neutral n = (2, 2)
chiral multiplet i = qi qi, together with a neutral n = (2, 2) twisted chiral multi-
plet, i, which is identied as the lagrange multiplier introduced in (11). we will
only consider  = 0 here and rewrite the fi parameter which appears as a twisted
f-terms as the more usual d-term

i

2 z d2 ii + h.c. = iz d4 ivi + h.c. .

using this trick, the full microscopic lagrangian becomes l = ld +lf , where ld is
given by (7) together with the replacement (10) and the fi d-term



i

xi=1

(i  i )(v + vi) ,

while the f-terms are of the form (13) with the (twisted) superpotentials given by

the above manipulations have led us to a reformulation of the microscopic action.
this form is particularly useful for describing the higgs branch soliton solutions.
to this end, we rst integrate out the gauge superelds, v + vi. moreover, in the
strong coupling limit of the gauge theory, e2  , the vector multiplet kinetic
terms decouple and the elds  and  become lagrange multipliers and may also be
integrated out, resulting in a n = (4, 4) massive sigma-model, where the metric and
torsion terms are given by ld = r d4 k, with

which indeed it does. the superpotentials are now simply w = pi imi and w =
ipi i mi/2.
finally, we restrict attention once more to the case of k = 2, where the constraints
(41) may be easily solved, with  = 1 =   2 and a similar expression for .
in order to exhibit the su(2)r action on the higgs branch, we introduce the 3-
vector supereld, r = (re(), im(), im()), together with the su(2)r singlet,  =
re(). if the scalar components are denoted using lower case version of their parent
supereld, the t-dualised description of the eguchi-hanson higgs branch has metric

ds2 = g(r)(dr  dr + dd) ,

where g(r) is given once again by (33). the model further diers from the original
higgs branch (32) by a torsion term that may be easily derived from (40). the
potential on the t-dualised higgs branch now arises from the superpotentials and is
given by v (r) = m 2g(r)1. this is precisely the same as the potential in the un-t-
dualised theory [3], thus providing an explicit derivation of (34). the kink solitons
in this model are now simply found using the techniques of the previous sections.
as on the coulomb branch, we insist upon time independent solutions to ensure the
vanishing of the torsion contribution to the action. once more, introducing a unit
4-vector, (n0, n), the energy of a time independent conguration is given by

e = z dx ng(r) (r  r + ) + m 2g(r)1o ,

= z dx (cid:26)g(cid:16)r  mg1n(cid:17)2
 2m (r  n + n0)|+


+2m r  n + 2mn0 ,

+ g(cid:16)  mg1n0(cid:17)2(cid:27)

.

in the familiar manner, the inequality is saturated for soliton solutions satisfying the
bogomolnyi equations

r = mg1n

and

 = mg1n0 ,

comparing with the bogomolnyi equations derived on the hyperkahler higgs branch,
we nd that  = . the q-kinks with momentum in the t-dual direction are
thus exchanged with winding congurations [3]. this provides further evidence for

20

the identication of the q-kink time dependence as fundamental strings. finally,
imposing the boundary conditions

r  0
r  

and
and

  0
as x   ,
   as x  + .

for arbitrary . the energy bound is maximised by choosing (n0, n)  (, ), and
the bogomolnyi equations are solved by

r = 1

 = 1

2  tanh(cid:16) 1
2 tanh(cid:16) 1

2|n|m(x  x0)(cid:17) + 1
2n0m(x  x0)(cid:17) + 1

2  ,
2  .

we again note that in the limit   0, there still exist non-trivial solutions to
the sigma-model equations of motion corresponding to d-string/f-string bound state
kinks.
