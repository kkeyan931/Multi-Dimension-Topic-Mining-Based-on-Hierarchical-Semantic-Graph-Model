abstract

we introduce a new spectral approach to non-perturbative eld the-
ory within the periodic eld formalism. as an example we calculate the
real and imaginary parts of the propagator in 1 + 1 dimensional 4 the-
ory, identifying both one-particle and multi-particle contributions. the
techniques we discuss have broad applications to the study of particle phe-
nomenology and minkowski-space dynamics.

1 introduction

modal expansion methods have recently been used to study non-perturbative
phenomena in quantum eld theory [1]-[3]. modal eld theory, the name for
the general procedure, consists of two main parts. the rst is to approximate
eld theory as a nite-dimensional quantum mechanical system. the second
is to analyze the properties of the reduced system using one of several com-
putational techniques. the quantum mechanical approximation is generated
by decomposing eld congurations into free wave modes. this technique has
been explored using both spherical partial waves (spherical eld theory [1][2])
and periodic box modes (periodic eld theory [3]).

having reduced eld theory to a more tractable quantum mechanical sys-
tem, we have several dierent ways to proceed. boson interactions in euclidean
space, for example, can be modeled using the method of diusion monte carlo.
in many situations, however, monte carlo techniques are inadequate. these
include unquenched fermion systems, processes in minkowski space, and the
phenomenology of multi-particle states. diculties arise when the functional
integral measure cannot be treated as a probability distribution or when in-
formation must be extracted from excited states obscured by dominant lower

lying states. fortunately there are several alternative methods in the modal
eld formalism which avoid these problems. matrix runge-kutta techniques
were introduced in [2] as a method for calculating unquenched fermion interac-
tions. here we discuss a dierent approach, one which directly calculates the
spectrum and eigenstates of the hamiltonian. for this approach it is essen-
tial that the hamiltonian is time-independent, and so we will consider periodic
rather than spherical eld theory. as we demonstrate, these methods naturally
accommodate the study of multi-particle states and minkowskian dynamics.

we will apply the new spectral approach to 1 + 1 dimensional 4 theory in
a periodic box and calculate the real and imaginary parts of the  propagator.
the euclidean version of this theory was discussed in [3], and more details about
the theory and periodic eld methods can be found there.

2 the spectral method

the eld conguration  in 1 + 1 dimensions is subject to periodic boundary
conditions (t,l) = (t, l). expanding in terms of periodic box modes, we
have

(t, x) = q 1

2l xn=0,1,...

n(t)einx/l.

(1)

the sum over momentum modes is regulated by choosing some large positive
number nmax and throwing out all high-momentum modes n such that |n| >
nmax. in this theory renormalization can be implemented by normal ordering
the 4 interaction term. after a straightforward calculation (details are given
in [3]), we nd that the counterterm hamiltonian has the form

we represent the canonical conjugate pair n and dn
operators qn and i 
to that for a quantum mechanical system with hamiltonian

dt using the schrodinger
. then the functional integral for 4 theory is equivalent

we now consider the hilbert space of our quantum mechanical system.

given d, an array of non-negative integers,

we denote pd(q) as the following monomial with total degree |d|,

d = {dnmax , dnmax} ,

pd(q) =

yn=nmax,nmax

qdn

n , xn

dn = |d| .

we dene g(q) to be a gaussian of the form1

 is an adjustable parameter which we will set later. any square-integrable
function (q) can be written as a superposition

(q) = xd

cd pd(q)g (q).

(8)

in this analysis we consider only the zero-momentum subspace. we impose this
constraint by restricting the sum in (8) to monomials satisfying

ndn = 0.

xn

(9)

we will restrict the space of functions (q) further by removing high energy

states in the following manner. let

k(d) = xn

|n| dn.

(10)

k(d) was rst introduced in [2] and provides an estimate of the kinetic energy as-
sociated with a given state. let us dene two auxiliary cuto parameters, kmax
and dmax. we restrict the sum in (8) to monomials such that k(d) < kmax
and |d|  dmax. we will refer to the corresponding subspace as vkmax,dmax .
the cuto kmax removes states with high kinetic energy and the cuto dmax
eliminates states with a large number of excited modes.2

our plan is to analyze the spectrum and eigenstates of h restricted to this
approximate low energy subspace, vkmax,dmax .3 for any xed l and nmax, h
is the hamiltonian for a nite-dimensional quantum mechanical system and the
results should converge in the limit kmax, dmax  . we obtain the desired
eld theory result by taking the limit l, nmax

l  .

1g(q) has been dened such that g(q) is the ground state of the free theory.
2in the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the broken symmetry of the vacuum may
require retaining a large number of q0 modes. this however is remedied by shifting the
variable, q

0 = q0  h0| q0 |0i.

3for nmax, kmax, dmax = 9, 19, 7 (values which we use in our calculations) the dimension

of vkmax,dmax is 2036.

3 results

we have calculated the matrix elements of h restricted to vkmax,dmax using a
symbolic dierentiation-integration algorithm4 and diagonalized h, obtaining
both eigenvalues and eigenstates. let  be the full propagator,

(p2) = iz d2x eip x

h0| t [(x)(0)] |0i .

(11)

we have computed  by inserting our complete set of eigenstates (complete in
vkmax,dmax). let mp be the multi-particle contribution to ,

mp(p2) = (p2)  pole(p2),

(12)

where pole is the single-particle pole contribution. we are primarily interested
in mp, a quantity that cannot be obtained for p2 > 0 using monte carlo
methods. since the imaginary part of pole is a delta function, it is easy to
distinguish the single-particle and multi-particle contributions in a plot of the
imaginary part of . the real part of , however, is dominated by the one-
particle pole. for this reason we have chosen to plot the real part of mp rather
than that of .

although we have referred to multi-particle states, it should be noted that
in our nite periodic box there are no true continuum multi-particle states.
instead we nd densely packed discrete spectra with level separation of size 
l1 which become continuum states in the limit l  . we can approximate
the contribution of these l   continuum states by a simple smoothing
process. we included a small width   l1 to each of the would-be continuum
states and averaged over a range of values for l. for the results we report here
we have averaged over values l = 2.0, 2.1, 2.8. for convenience all units
have been scaled such that  = 1.
the parameter  was adjusted to reduce the errors due to the nite cuto
values kmax and dmax.
since the spectrum of h is bounded below, errors
due to nite kmax and dmax generally drive the estimated eigenvalues higher.
one strategy, therefore, is to optimize  by minimizing the trace of h restricted
to the subspace vkmax,dmax . the approach used here is a slight variation
of this  we have minimized the trace of h restricted to a smaller subspace
max  vkmax,dmax . the aim is to accelerate the convergence of the
vk 
lowest energy states rather than the entire space vkmax,dmax . throughout our
analysis we used k

max = 8, 3.

for 

4! = 0.50 we have plotted the imaginary part of  in figure 1 and the
real part of mp in figure 2. the value 
4! = 0.50 is above the threshold for
reliable perturbative approximation5 ( 
4! . 0.25) but below the critical value at
which    symmetry breaks spontaneously ( 
4!  2.5). the contribution of
the one-particle state appears near p2 = (0.93)2 and the three-particle threshold

is at approximately p2 = (2.9)2. we have chosen several dierent values for
nmax, kmax, dmax to show the convergence as these parameters become large.
the plot for nmax, kmax, dmax = 9, 19, 7 appears relatively close to the asymp-
totic limit. the somewhat bumpy texture of the curves is due to the nite size
of our periodic box and diminishes with increasing l. from dimensional power
counting, we expect errors for nite nmax to scale as n 2
max. assuming that
kmax and dmax also function as uniform energy cutos, we expect a similar
error dependence  and it appears plausible from the results in figures 1 and 2.
a more systematic analysis of the errors and extrapolation methods for nite
nmax, kmax, dmax, and l, will be presented in future work.

in figures 3 and 4 we have compared our spectral calculations with the
two-loop perturbative result for 
4! = 0.01. we have used nmax, kmax, dmax =
9, 19, 7, and the agreement appears good. for small 
4! the propagator has a
very prominent logarithmic cusp at the three-particle threshold, which can be
seen clearly in figures 3 and 4.

in figures 5 and 6 we have compared results for 

4! = 0.25, 0.50, 1.00. we
have again used nmax, kmax, dmax = 9, 19, 7.
in contrast with the quadratic
scaling in the perturbative regime, the results here scale approximately linearly
with 
4! . an interesting and perhaps related observation is that the magnitude
of the multi-particle contribution to  remains small (. 0.003) even for the
large coupling value 
4! = 1.00. we also note that the singular threshold be-
havior appears relatively less prominent as 
4! increases, and a maximum in the
imaginary part of  develops away from the threshold.
in future studies we
plan to examine these features for much larger values of nmax, kmax, dmax, and
l.

4 summary

we have introduced a new spectral approach to periodic eld theory and used it
to calculate the propagator in 1 + 1 dimensional 4 theory. this technique can
handle a number of problems in particle phenomenology and non-perturbative
minkowskian dynamics inaccessible to monte carlo methods. we are in the
process of improving our diagonalization algorithm by implementing faster and
less memory-intensive sparse-matrix methods. several new applications of this
technique are being considered regarding the properties of bound states, reso-
nances, and s-matrix elements.
