abstract

based on the rational r-matrix of the supersymmetric sl(2, 1) matrix dierence
equations are solved by means of a generalization of the nested algebraic bethe
ansatz. these solutions are shown to be of highest-weight with respect to the
underlying graded lie algebra structure.

1 introduction

the supersymmetric t-j model is often considered a candidate for describing high tc su-
perconductivity [1, 2, 3]. the underlying symmetry is described by the supersymmetric
(graded) lie algebra sl(2, 1). integrable models with supersymmetry have been discussed
also in [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. this article extends the results in [10, 11] on matrix dier-
ence equations and a generalized version of the algebraic bethe ansatz for ordinary or
quantum groups to this supersymmetric lie algebra. we recall that matrix dierence
equations play an important role in mathematical physics, see e.g. [12, 13, 14, 15]. in
particular in the context of quantum integrable eld theories they provide solutions of
the formfactor equations, which can be used to calculate correlation functions [16]. this
type of matrix dierence equations can also be considered as a discrete version [17] of a
knizhnik-zamolodchikov system [18].

the conventional algebraic bethe ansatz is used to solve the eigenvalue problem of
a hamiltonian in a way closely related to the underlying symmetry of the considered
model (see e.g. [19]). one constructs the eigenvectors as highest weight vectors of the
corresponding irreducible representations either of the ordinary lie algebra or the q-
deformed analogue, the quantum group. by this construction one encounters unwanted
terms. the eigenvalue equation is fullled if all these unwanted terms vanish which leads
to the so called bethe ansatz equations.

the o-shell bethe ansatz [20, 21, 17, 10, 11] is used to solve matrix dierential or
dierence equations. the solution is represented as an integral or a sum over some lat-
tice (integral of jackson type). the unwanted terms arising in this case do not vanish

due to the bethe ansatz equations but they sum up to zero under the integral or sum.
this modication of the bethe ansatz has originally been introduced to solve knizhnik-
zamolodchikov equations [20]. it has also been applied to the quantization of dimension-
ally reduced gravity [22] in this connection.

c3 be a vector valued function having the following

j=1

f ij(   , xi, xj,    ) = rji(xj  xi)f ji(   , xj, xi,    ),

(1)

where r is the sl(2, 1) r-matrix (see below). we consider the set of matrix dierence
equations

f 1n(x1,    , xi + ,    , xn) = q1n(x|i)f 1n(x)

(i = 1,    , n)

(2)

with an arbitrary shift-parameter  and some sort of generalized tranfer matrix q1n(x|i)
invariant under sl(2, 1). functions satisfying (1) and (2) will be called r-symmetric and
q-periodic respectively.

2 matrix dierence equation and generalized nested

bethe ansatz

let v 1n = v1      vn be the tensor product of n isomorphic vector spaces vi =
span {|1i, |2i, |3i} = c3. the states |1i and |2i are supposed to be bosonic while |3i
is fermionic [3]. for later convenience we also dene the reduced vector spaces vi =
span {|2i, |3i} = c2 and v 1m = v1      vm. vectors in v 1n will be denoted
by f 1n  v 1n. analogously vectors in the reduced spaces are in addition marked
with a tilde: f 1m  v 1m. matrices acting in v 1n are denoted with index subscripts
q1n : v 1n  v 1n.

as usual the r-matrix will depend on a spectral parameter . this matrix rij() :

vi  vj  vj  vi is of the form [23]

rij() = b()ij + c()pij

(3)

where pij : |i  |i 7 |i  |i is the permutation operator and

ij : |i  |i 7 |i  |i = (cid:26) |i  |i

|i  |i

, |i = |i = |3i
, else.

the statistics factor  = 1 takes the fermionic character of the state |3i into account.
it has the value 1 if and only if both states are fermionic, i.e.  =  = 3. the
functions b() and c() have the form

b() =



 + k

c() =

k

 + k

with an arbitrary constant k. for later use we dene the function w() = b() + c().
it is easy to check that r() is unitary and satises the yang-baxter equation:

rab()rba() = 1

and r12(12)r13(13)r23(23) = r23(23)r13(13)r12(12),

(4)

where ij = i  j.

next we introduce dierent kinds of monodromy matrices which prove to be useful in

the following. the monodromy matrix

t1n,a(x|u) = r1a(x1  u)    rna(xn  u).

is an operator v 1n va  va v 1n. the vector spaces v 1n and va are called quantum
and auxiliary space respectively. as usual we will consider this operator as a matrix

t1n,a = 


a b2 b3
c 2 d2
2 d2
3
c 3 d3
2 d3
3




over the auxiliary space with operators in the quantum space as entries. as a consequence
of (4) the monodromy matrix fullls the yang-baxter algebra relation

rab(u  v)t1n,b(x|v)t1n,a(x|u) = t1n,a(x|u)t1n,b(x|v)rab(u  v).

(5)

following [10] we also introduce another set of modied monodromy matrices for i =

1,    , n given as

t q
1n,a(x|i) = r1a(x1  xi)    ri1a(xi1  xi)piari+1a(xi+1  x

i)    rna(xn  x

i),

where x  = x+ei. in the same way as above they should be considered as matrices in the
auxiliary space. this new type of monodromy matrix satises the two mixed yang-baxter
relations

t q
1n,a(x|i)t1n,b(x|u)rab(x
t1n,a(x |u)t q

1n,a(x|i)rab(u  x

i) = rab(u  xi)t q

i  u) = rab(xi  u)t1n,b(x |u)t q

1n,a(x|i)
1n,b(x|i)t1n,a(x|u).

for i = n the modied monodromy matrix is the same as the ordinary one.

we want to encode the fermionic nature of the state |3i in such a way that sl(2, 1)

appears naturally. to do so we dene an additional monodromy matrix

[t 

1n,a(x|u)],{}

,{} = 1    n[t1n,a(x|u)],{}
,{},

(6)

where the quantum space indices are collected in the notation {} = 1,    , n. this
denition is easily extended to a modied version as before. the shift operator is dened
by

q1n(x|i) = trat q

1n,a(x|i) = aq

1n,a(x|i) + x=2,3hdq

1n,a(x|i)i



.

(7)

which is obviously closely related to usual transfer matrices. for all operators just dened
there also exists a counterpart in the reduced spaces denoted by a tilde.

using the yang-baxter relations given above we derive in a straightforward way the

commutation relations

the rst terms on the right hand side of each of these equations are called wanted
the others unwanted. these relations are slightly dierent than those appearing in the
su(n)-case [10] due to the statistics factors  in the last two equations.

to solve the system of (1) and the matrix dierence equations (2) we use the nested
so called o shell bethe ansatz [20, 21] with two levels. the rst level is quite analogous
to the constructions in [10, 11]. due to the fermionic statistics of state |3i which ensures
supersymmetry the second level is dierent. this problem is solved in the present paper.
we write the vector valued function f 1n : cn  v 1n as a sum of rst level bethe ansatz
vectors

f 1n(x) = xu

bm(x|um)    b1(x|u1)1n[g1m(x|u)]1m.

(13)

the sum is extended over u  u0  zm  cm (integral of jackson type, u0  cm
arbitrary). the reference state 1n is given by 1n = |1in and the auxiliary function
g1m : cn  cm  v 1m is dened by g1m(x|u) = (x|u) f 1m(u) with  : cn  cm  c

they may be multiplied by an arbitrary function which is periodic in .

we prove that f 1n(x) is r-symmetric and q-periodic if f 1m(u) is r-symmetric
and q-periodic. to compute the action of the shift operator q on our bethe ansatz
function f 1n(x) we start from (7) and commute the operators aq und dq through
all the b-operators to the right where they act on the reference states according to
 1n = 0. if f 1m(u) is r-symmetric one ob-

aq(x|m)1n = 1n and (cid:2)dq(x|m)(cid:3)

the hat denotes a factor which is omitted and q(u1,    , um, ui|i) is an analogue to the
shift operator (7) in the dimensionally reduced space v 1mi. the wanted contributions
already ensure the validity of (2), so unwanted ones have to sum up to zero. the repre-
sentation can be obtained as follows: the expression in front of the sum is a consequence
of the wanted parts of the commutation relations (8)-(12). to determine the functions
(i)
a (x|u) and (i)
d (x|u) one has to perform the following steps: first move bi(x|ui) to the
front of the b-operators according to (8) and use the r-symmetry of f (u) to absorb them.
then consider the unwanted contributions of (10) and (12) respectively. now commute
the resulting operators a(x|ui) and d(x|ui) to the right and only take the wanted
contributions into account. this gives a product of r-matrices and statistics factors in
the case of d. the action on the reference state is given by a(x|ui)1n = 1n and
[d(x|ui)]
j=1 b(xj  ui)1n respectively. by an ice rule for fermions
one can regroup the statistics factors. together with the r-matrices this gives the reduced
shift operator q(u1,    , um, ui|i). finally one obtains

  qn

 1n =

a (x|u) =

c(ui  xn)

b(xl  ui).

as already mentioned we have to show that the contributions of the sums cancel.
following the arguments of [10], i.e. using (14) and the relation c(x)
b(x) , one can
indeed show that these unwanted contributions vanish after the summation, if f 1m(u)
is q-periodic. the symmetry of (x|u) in the arguments x1,    , xn combined with
rij()1n = 1n implies the r-symmetry of f 1n(x).

b(x) =  c(x)

the next step consists in the construction of a function f 1m(u) which is r-symmetric

and q-periodic. as above we write
f 1m(u) = xv

5

b(u|vk)    b(u|v1) 1mg(u|v).

(16)

the sum is extended over v  v0  zk  ck (v0  ck arbitrary). here the reference
state is given by 1m = |2im and the auxiliary function g : cm  ck  c reads

b(  x)

(17)

possible solutions of (17) are given by (15) and  (x) = x/(x  k). again both functions
may be multiplied by an arbitrary function periodic in . note that the supersymmetry
has modied the last equation compared to (14).

the yang-baxter relations imply the commutation relations

b(u|v2) b(u|v1) = w(v1  v2) b(u|v1) b(u|v2)

a(u|v2) b(u|v1) =

aq(u|i) b(u|v) =

b(u|v2) d(u|v1)

b(u |v) d

q

(u|i) +

bq(u|i) d(u|v).

due to supersymmetry these relations are structurally dierent from those for the ordi-
nary group case [10]. as a consequence the function  has to satisfy a slightly modied
functional equation (17) compared to  in (14).

next we act with the shift operator q1m(u|i) = aq(u|i) + d

(u|i) on the bethe
ansatz vector f 1m(u) and repeat the arguments given above. the equations (2) are
equivalent for all i = 1,    , m, so we will restrict ourselves to i = m. using the relations
aq(u|m) 1m = 1m and d
(u|m) 1m = 0 we get the representations (u  = u+em)

by similar arguments as before one can show that the functions (i)
are given by

we made use of the fact that w()w() = 1 and w()

b() = 1

b() .

again the wanted contributions already guarantee the validity of (2) while a straight-
forward calculation using (17) and c(x)
b(x) shows that the unwanted contributions
sum up to zero. the r-symmetry is implied by the symmetry of g(u|v) in the vari-
ables u1,    , um and the property rij() 1m = 1m.

b(x) =  c(x)

finally we have proved that f 1n given by the bethe ansatz (13) solves the combined
system of r-symmetry (1) and the matrix dierence equations (2) if analogous relations
hold for f 1m.
it was shown that solutions to the dimensional reduced problem can
explicitly be constructed by use of the bethe ansatz (16).

3 highest-weight property

we now investigate the sl(2, 1)-properties of the shift operator q1n and of the solu-
tions (13) constructed above. the behaviour rab(x) = ab + k
x pab + o(x2) for x  
implies the asymptotic expansion

from this one derives the commutation relations

where the quantum space indices have been neglected. a further consequence is

 .

for u  . this implies that the operators m 
 are generators of sl(2, 1) in the cartan-
weyl basis (see [3, 24]). from (21) one can derive the invariance property [m 
 , q(u|i)] =
0. this means that from any solution of (2) further solutions may be constructed by ap-
plying raising and lowering operators of sl(2, 1). the operators w = m 
 (no summation
with respect to ) satisfy the commutation relations [w, w] = 0 and generate the
cartan subalgebra. for  =  the statistic signs in (20) cancel and therefore we get

[w]{}

(22)

the highest-weight property of the bethe ansatz functions m 

 f 1n(x) = 0 for  > 
in other words one uses
is proven in a way analogous to the one used in section 2.
commutation relations implied by (21), then commutes the matrices m 
 through all b-
operators to the right and nally, one uses certain eigenvalue equations. again one has

7

wanted and unwanted contributions and the summation guarantees the vanishing of
the latter (compare [10]). after some calculation one obtains the weight vector which is
dened by wf (x) = wf (x) and reads

w = (n  m, m  k, k).

the highest-weight conditions are w1  w2  w3 and w1, w2, w3  0 [3].

4 conclusions and outlook

in this article we have discussed a combined system of matrix dierence equations based
on the supersymmetric lie algebra sl(2, 1). solutions are constructed by means of a
nested version of the so called o-shell bethe ansatz and shown to be of highest weight
with respect to sl(2, 1). due to the invariance of the shift operator q1m under the
generators of sl(2, 1) it is possible to construct and classify further solutions by purely
group theoretic considerations.

it would be interesting to see wether there is a quantum integrable (relativistic) eld
theory associated to the supersymmetric t-j model. in that case the methods presented
here could be used to determine the corresponding correlation functions. in this context
the extension of our results to the q-deformed case uq[sl(2, 1)] would also be of interest [2,
25]. recently there has been discussed an integrable quantum eld theory based on the
osp(2, 2) graded lie algebra [4] which is isomorphic to sl(2, 1).
