abstract

we study the general gaugings of n = 2 maxwell-einstein supergravity theories (mesgt) in ve
dimensions, extending and generalizing previous work. the global symmetries of these theories are
of the form su (2)rg, where su (2)r is the r-symmetry group of the n = 2 poincare superalgebra
and g is the group of isometries of the scalar manifold that extend to symmetries of the full action.
we rst gauge a subgroup k of g by turning some of the vector elds into gauge elds of k while
dualizing the remaining vector elds into tensor elds transforming in a non-trivial representation
of k. surprisingly, we nd that the presence of tensor elds transforming non-trivially under the
yang-mills gauge group leads to the introduction of a potential which does not admit an ads ground
state. next we give the simultaneous gauging of the u (1)r subgroup of su (2)r and a subgroup k
of g in the presence of k-charged tensor multiplets. the potential introduced by the simultaneous
gauging is the sum of the potentials introduced by gauging k and u (1)r separately. we present
a list of possible gauge groups k and the corresponding representations of tensor elds. for the
exceptional supergravity we nd that one can gauge the so(6) subgroup of the isometry group
e6(26) of the scalar manifold if one dualizes 12 of the vector elds to tensor elds just as in the
gauged n = 8 supergravity.

introduction

gauged supergravity4 theories in various dimensions have been studied extensively in the
early and mid-eighties (see e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]).

in the last few years there has been a renewed intense interest in gauged supergravity
theories. this interest is driven mainly by the work on ads/cft (anti-de sitter/conformal
eld theory) dualities [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. for example, the iib superstring theory on the
background manifold ads5  s5 with n units of ve-form ux through the ve-sphere, is
conjectured to be equivalent (at least in a certain limit) to 4d n = 4 super yang mills
theory with gauge group su (n ), which is a conformally invariant quantum eld theory. in
the limit of small string coupling and large n , the classical (ie. tree level) iib supergravity
approximation becomes valid and can be used to discuss the large n limit of the correspond-
ing dual yang mills theory. the importance of gauged supergravity lies in the fact that
5d gauged n = 8 supergravity [3, 4, 5] is believed to be a consistent nonlinear truncation
of the lowest lying kaluza klein modes of iib supergravity on ads5  s5 [12, 13].5 many
aspects of the ads/cft correspondence, such as the renormalization group ows of certain
non-conformal deformations of the yang mills theory with a smaller number of supersym-
metries, can therefore be studied entirely within the framework of 5d gauged supergravity
due to the lack of interference with the higher kaluza-klein modes [16, 17]. thus, gauged
supergravity theories lie at the core of ads/cft dualities.

on the other hand, ve-dimensional n = 2 gauged supergravity is the natural frame-
work for so-called brane world scenarios in which our 4d world is realized as a domain wall
in an eectively ve-dimensional theory [18, 19, 20]. in fact, certain m-theory compacti-
cations [21, 22, 23, 24] seem to suggest theories which appear ve-dimensional at a certain
intermediate length scale, at which the eective eld theory is given by a certain 5d n = 2
gauged supergravity plus 4d standard model-type matter elds on the 4d boundaries of this
5d spacetime.

motivated by the above-mentioned applications, as well as others, we study the most
general gaugings of 5d, n = 2 supergravity theories coupled to vector as well as tensor
multiplets. the work presented here represents a generalization and an extension of earlier
work on the gaugings of n = 2 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets [25, 26, 27, 28, 29].
the organization of the paper is as follows. for the convenience of the reader, section 2

4 the term gauged supergravity commonly refers to (usually n -extended) supergravity theories in
which a subgroup of the automorphism group (alias r-symmetry group) of the underlying supersymmetry
algebra is realized as a local (yang-mills-type) gauge symmetry. sometimes, this term is also used for
gaugings of other global symmetry groups that are not subgroups of the r-symmetry group. in this paper,
we will refer to the latter type of theories as yang-mills/einstein supergravity theories.
in contrast,
ungauged supergravity theories are those for which the r-symmetry group is just a global symmetry
group of the lagrangian.

5 the consistency of the nonlinear truncation of the s 7 and s 4 compactications of 11-dimensional

supergravity was shown in [14] and [15], respectively.

briey summarizes the basic features of ungauged maxwell-einstein supergravity theories.
focussing on the global symmetries of these ungauged theories, we list the possible types
of their gaugings. the subsequent four sections describe each of these gauge types in
detail: section 3 summarizes the gauging of a u (1)r subgroup of the n = 2 r-symmetry
group su (2)r. sections 4 and 5 are devoted to the gauging of a subgroup k of the
isometry group g of the scalar manifold: section 4 summarizes the well-known case without
tensor elds, whereas section 5 covers the case when tensor elds have to be introduced.
the simultaneous gauging of u (1)r and k is treated in section 6. we conclude with a
classication of possible gauge groups and the corresponding representations of tensor elds
in section 7 and a short discussion of our results in section 8.

2 ungauged n = 2 maxwell-einstein supergravity theories

and their global symmetries

in this section, we briey recall the most relevant features of the (ungauged) n = 2 maxwell-
einstein supergravity theories (mesgt) constructed in [25]. unless otherwise stated, our
conventions will coincide with those of ref.
[25], where further details can be found. in
particular, we will use the metric signature (++++) and impose the symplectic majorana
condition on all fermionic quantities.
 , two gravitini i

(i = 1, 2) and a vector eld a. an n = 2 vector multiplet contains a vector eld a, two
spin-1/2 fermions i and one real scalar eld . the fermions of each of these multiplets
transform as doublets under the u sp(2)r = su (2)r r-symmetry group of the n = 2
poincare superalgebra; all other elds are su (2)r-inert.
the n = 2 mesgts constructed in [25] describe the coupling of n vector multiplets

the elds of the n = 2 supergravity multiplet are the funfbein em

to supergravity. hence, the total eld content is

where we have combined the graviphoton with the n vector elds of the n vector multiplets
into a single (n + 1)-plet of vector elds a i
 labelled by the index i. the indices a, b, . . . and
x, y, . . . should be interpreted as at and curved indices, respectively, of the n-dimensional
target space manifold m of the scalar elds. (our indices ( i, a, x) correspond to the indices
(i, a, x) in refs. [25, 26, 27].)

here, e denotes the funfbein determinant, whereas r() and  = () are the scalar

by supersymmetry. these constraints also involve f a
x and imply that all scalar eld
dependent quantities are completely determined by the constant symmetric tensor c i j k
that appears in the f  f  a- term in (2.2). the c i j k thus uniquely determine the whole

hypersurface

(2.5)

of an (n+1)-dimensional ambient space parametrized by (n+1) coordinates h i . the result-
ing geometry of these theories was later referred to as very special geometry. in [27] it
was suggested that the compactication of 11-dimensional supergravity over a calabi-yau
threefold would lead to d = 5 , n = 2 mesgts coupled to hypermultiplets. the calabi-
yau compactications of 11d supergravity were later studied in [30] where it was explicitly
shown that they lead to n = 2 mesgts with (h(1,1)  1) vector multiplets coupled to
(h(2,1) + 1) hypermultiplets. (h(1,1) and h(2,1) are the hodge numbers of the corresponding
calabi-yau manifold.)

the c i j k themselves are not completely arbitrary. going to a particular basis [25],

they can be brought to the following form

c000 = 1, c0ij = 

1
2

ij, c00i = 0

(2.6)

and the remaining coecients cijk (i, j, k = 1, 2, . . . , n) may be chosen at will. we shall
refer to this basis as the canonical basis.

the arbitrariness of the cijk shows that, even for a xed number n of vector multiplets,
various target manifolds m are possible. a classication of these very special real mani-
folds has been given in [31] for the case that m is a homogeneous space. this class contains
the subclass of symmetric spaces, which were classied already long time ago [25, 27]. al-
though our further discussion is not at all restricted to symmetric (or even homogeneous)
m, we will look at the symmetric spaces in a somewhat greater detail in section 7. let
us therefore list the possible symmetric spaces for later reference. the symmetric spaces
m fall into two dierent categories, depending on whether they are associated with jordan
algebras or not:
(i) m = str0(j)

, where str0(j) and aut(j) are the reduced structure group and the auto-
morphism group, respectively, of a formally real, unital, jordan algebra, j, of degree three
[25, 32]. this jordan class can be further divided into two subclasses:

aut(j)

 generic or reducible jordan class:

j = r  n : m =

so(n  1, 1)  so(1, 1)

so(n  1)

,

n  1.

(2.7)

here, n is a jordan algebra of degree two, which can be identied as the algebra of
dirac gamma matrices in an (n  1)-dimensional (internal) minkowski space with
the product being one half the anticommutator.

4

 irreducible or magical jordan class. the corresponding jordan algebras are sim-
ple and are isomorphic to the hermitian (33)-matrices over the four division algebras
r, c, h, o with the product being the anticommutator. they lead to the following
target spaces:

jr
3 : m = sl(3, r)/so(3),
jc
3 : m = sl(3, c)/su(3),
3 : m = su(6)/usp(6),
jh
jo
3 : m = e6(26)/f4,

(n = 5)
(n = 8)
(n = 14)
(n = 26)

,

n > 1. this class is not associated with jordan algebras and will

(ii) m = so(1,n)

so(n)

therefore be referred to as the symmetric non-jordan-family [27].

we will now turn to the global symmetries of a generic mesgt (with possibly non-
symmetric or non-homogeneous m) described by (2.2). two dierent global symmetries
have to be distinguished:

 any n = 2 mesgt is globally invariant under the r-symmetry group su (2)r. this
symmetry is inherited from the underlying supersymmetry algebra and acts exclusively
on the fermions i

 and ia (ie. on their index i).

is automatically a symmetry of the whole lagrangian (2.2), since the latter is uniquely
determined by the c i j k. in particular, these symmetries give rise to isometries of the
scalar manifolds m, which becomes manifest if one rewrites the kinetic energy term
for the scalar elds as [25, 31]

important (but not the only) examples with such a non-trivial symmetry group g are
given by the aforementioned symmetric space cases. in the jordan class, g coincides with
the full isometry group of m (ie. with the full numerator group str0(j)). for the

5

symmetric non-jordan family, g = [so(n1)so(1, 1)]t(n1) where  denotes the semi-
direct product and t(n1) is the group of translations in an (n  1) dimensional euclidean
space. note that for this family g is only a subgroup of the target space isometry group
so(1, n) [33].

the fact that the total global symmetry group of (2.2) factorizes into su (2)r  g is a
consequence of the su (2)r-invariance of the scalar elds belonging to the vector multiplets
and allows to study the gaugings of the two factors separately. in general matter coupled
extended supergravity theories the r-symmetry group is nontrivially embedded into some
larger global symmetry group if the scalar elds are not singlets under it.

let us now turn to the possible gaugings of subgroups of su (2)r  g. since the
vector elds are all su (2)r-inert, they cannot serve as non-abelian gauge elds for the full
6. we will therefore only consider gaugings of subgroups of u (1)r  g, where u (1)r
su (2)r
denotes the u (1) subgroup of su (2)r. this obviously leaves the following possibilities:

(i) one can simply gauge the u (1)r subgroup of su (2)r by coupling a linear combination
of the vector elds to the fermions [26], which are the only elds that transform
nontrivially under su (2)r. in general, this kind of gauging (which we will refer to as
gauged mesgt) introduces a scalar potential (see section 3).

(ii) another possibility is to gauge a subgroup k of g. in this case, which we will refer
to as yang-mills/einstein supergravity, at least a subset of the vector elds has to
transform in the adjoint representation of k so that these vector elds can serve as the
corresponding yang-mills gauge elds. if there are additional vector elds (spectator
vector elds) beyond these gauge elds, there are two possibilities. they are either
k-singlets or some of them transform non-trivially under k. in the former case, there
are no technical diculties and the gauging can be performed as described in [26] and
leads to a theory without scalar potential (see section 4)

(iii) if there are vector elds that are charged under k, one faces the same problem that
was rst encountered in the context of maximally extended gauged supergravity in
seven [2] and subsequently in ve dimensions [3, 4, 5]. the problem is that a naive
gauging of k would introduce masses for these vector elds, thereby leading to a mis-
match between bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. the only known solution to
this problem is to convert the charged vector elds into two-form elds with self-dual
eld equations [35]. in the maximally extended theories, this idea is also supported by
the analysis of the spectra of the underlying kaluza-klein compactications [12, 13].

(iv) finally, one can combine (i) and (ii), or alternatively (i) and (iii), and simultaneously
gauge both u (1)r and k  g. we will refer to this type of gauging as gauged
6one could, however, try to identify su (2)r with an su (2)-subgroup of g and then gauge this diagonal

subgroup, yet we have not considered such a possibility in the present paper.

6

yang-mills/einstein supergravity.

the rst two possibilities were studied in [26, 28, 29] with special emphasis on the cases
were m is a symmetric space of the jordan family. it is the purpose of this paper to extend
some of the aspects that were discussed in [26, 28, 29] for the gaugings of type (i) and (ii)
to more general m and, moreover, study the so far uncovered gaugings of type (iii) and
(iv), thereby closing a gap in the existing literature.

3 gauged maxwell/einstein supergravity

in order to gauge the u (1)r-subgroup of the su (2)r r-symmetry group, one promotes a
linear combination of the (n + 1) vector elds a i

 to the u (1)r-gauge eld

i
a[u (1)r] = v i a
,

(3.1)

where v i are (n + 1) constants, and replaces the derivatives of the fermionic elds by u (1)r-
covariant derivatives

where gr denotes the u (1)r-coupling constant. the appearance of the ij is due to the
convention that the su (2)r-indices i, j, . . . are raised and lowered with the antisymmetric
metric ij = ji, 12 = 12 = 1 [25, 26]. this u (1)r-covariantization in the lagrangian
(2.2) and the transformation laws (2.3) breaks the original supersymmetry.
in order to
restore it, some gr-dependent gauge invariant terms have to be added. the additional
terms in the lagrangian are [26, 29] (the numerical factors are chosen for convenience)

(3.9)

where the i, j , k are raised with the inverse of a i j .
in our metric signature, a critical
point c of the scalar potential with p (r)(c) < 0 corresponds to an anti-de sitter ground
state. the critical points of the potential (3.8) have been analyzed in [26, 29] for the jordan
cases.
if a critical point exists, it was found that, depending on the linear combination
(3.1) of the vector elds, one either gets an n = 2 supersymmetric anti-de sitter ground
state, or the scalar potential vanishes identically, and thus admits a minkowski vacuum
with spontaneously broken supersymmetry.

4 yang-mills/einstein supergravity without tensor elds

we now consider the gauging of a subgroup k of g. as mentioned earlier, this type requires
that a subset {ai
i, j, . . . = 1, . . . dimk} of the vector elds transforms in the adjoint
;
representation of k. in this section, we assume that if there are additional spectator vector
elds {am
 ; m, n, p = 1, . . . , (n + 1) dimk}, they are all k-singlets (i.e., we are dealing
with the gauging of type (ii)).
the only elds that transform under k are the scalar elds x, the spinor elds ia and
, (i = 1, . . . dimk). the k-covariantization is thus achieved by replacing

the vector els ai
the corresponding derivatives/eld strenghts by their k-gauge covariant counterparts:

5 yang-mills/einstein supergravity with tensor elds

we now turn to case (iii) of our gauge type classication and consider the gauging of
k  g, when not all the spectator vector elds are k-singlets. as mentioned earlier,
consistency with supersymmetry requires that these k-charged spectator vector elds have
to be dualized to self-dual two-form elds [35, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13]. we will therefore split the
vector elds a i
 of the ungauged theory (2.2)-(2.3) of section 2 into two sets. the rst set
contains the vector elds in the adjoint representation of the gauge group k plus possible
k-singlets. the second set contains the remaining k-charged vector elds. we will use
indices i, j, k, . . . = 1, . . . , n for the rst and m, n, p, . . . = 1, . . . 2m for the second set,
where n + 2m = n + 1. the reason for the even number 2m is that the self-duality-
condition of [35] requires complex tensor elds for d = 5, which we will always consider as
being decomposed into their real and imaginary parts. the gauging now proceeds as follows.
first, one has to replace all abelian eld strenghts f i
 by the corresponding non-abelian
j k being the structure constants of k 7,
generalizations f i
and the f m

 by the above-mentioned self-dual two-form elds bm
 :

again, the only exception to this replacement is the f  f  a-term of the ungauged theory.
since no naked am

 can appear anymore, we rst require

and since terms of the form bm  f i  aj appear to be impossible to supersymmetrize in
a gauge invariant way (except possibly in very special cases) we shall also assume that

cm n p = 0

(5.2)

cm ij = 0

(5.3)

hence, the only non-vanishing c i j k have the index structure cij k and cim n . the covari-
antization of the cij kf i  f j  ak-term again leads to a chern-simons term (see below).
the term of the form cim n ai  bm  bn has its natural place in the gauge-invariant
kinetic energy term for the tensor elds bm
 (cf. eqs.(5.4) and (5.6)). the gauge covariant
derivative of these tensor elds reads

(5.5)

after all these modications, the original supersymmetry of the ungauged theory (2.2)-
(2.3) is again badly broken. this time, however, the supersymmetry breaking is not only
due to the gauge covariantization alone. an additional source for the breakdown of su-
persymmetry is provided by the loss of the bianchi identity for the tensor elds bm
 (ie.
dbm 6= 0 in general). the corresponding bianchi identity df i = 0 for the f i
 in the
ungauged theory is needed at several places to cancel certain supersymmetry variations in
(2.2).

remarkably enough, supersymmetry can again be restored by adding further g-dependent

where the comma denotes partial dierentiation with respect to the scalar elds. these
last two conditions, however, can be shown to follow automatically from the various other
constraints.

the above scalar potential p () deserves some comments.
first of all, it is a bit surprising that there is a scalar potential at all, since no minimal
couplings to the gravitini have been introduced at this point, and, as we have seen in section
4, the pure yang-mills/einstein supergravity theories without antisymmetric tensor elds
do not involve a scalar potential. in fact, the necessity for the scalar potential in the above
lagrangian can eventually be traced back to the loss of the bianchi identity for the bm
 ,
which are not present in the theories considered in section 4.

the second important point about the potential is its sign. as mentioned at the end
of section 3, in our metric signature, a critical point with p (c) < 0 would correspond to
an anti-de sitter solution. the explicit form (5.11) of our potential, however, is manifestly
non-negative. therefore, the n = 2 yang-mills/einstein supergravity theories with tensor
multiplets do not admit an anti-de sitter solution. this might at rst seem surprising, since
it was, among other things, the representation theory of the ads5-superalgebra su (2, 2|4)
that hinted towards the dualization of twelve vector elds to antisymmetric tensor elds in
the gauging of the n = 8 supergravity theory in d = 5 [3, 4, 5]. for n = 2 however, this
argument does not apply anymore, since the n = 2 anti-de sitter graviton supermultiplet
also contains only one vector eld and no tensor elds, giving rise to the same eld content
as its n = 2 super poincare counterpart. thus, for n = 2, the antisymmetric tensor elds
do not necessarily have to be associated with anti-de sitter spacetimes anymore.

6 gauged yang-mills/einstein supergravity with tensor

elds

we will now come to case (iv) of our list of possible gaugings and simultaneously gauge
the u (1)r r-symmetry subgroup and a subgroup k of g. we will do this for the most
general case with tensor elds, since the case without tensor elds can easily be recovered as
a special case. our starting point will be the yang-mills/einstein supergravity with tensor
elds presented in the previous section, i.e. eqs. (5.6)-(5.7).

as in section 3, we will take a linear combination of the vector elds ai

 as the u (1)r-

gauge eld

a[u (1)r] = vi ai


(6.1)

with some constants vi , which at this point are completely arbitrary. (note, however, that
we dont sum over i like in section 3, i.e., vm = 0.) the gauging of u (1)r then obviously
requires the u (1)r-covariantization of all fermionic derivatives:
dai  (da)i  dai + grvi ai

where gr again denotes the u (1)r-coupling constant and d is the k-covariant derivative
introduced in (5.5). again, this gauge covariantization breaks supersymmetry, and to restore
it, new gr-dependent terms have to be added to the lagrangian and the transformation
laws.

however, these can be shown to be consequences of the other constraints and therefore do
not give rise to additional restrictions.

it should be noted that the constraints (6.5)-(6.8) are almost the same as in the case of
the pure u (1)r-gauging described in section 3. yet there are two important dierences. the
rst is that the (completely arbitrary) v i of section 3 are now subject to two constraints,
namely eq. (6.9) and vm = 0, which is merely a trivial consequence of (6.1).

the second dierence is that (6.8) is not the full scalar potential. the latter is now a sum
of the u (1)r-related potential p (r) and the potential p , which was due to the introduction
of the 2-form elds (cf. eqs. (5.6) and (5.11)):

e1lpot = g2p  g2
these dierences have some interesting implications:

rp (r)

(6.11)

eq. (6.9) gives a new constraint on the possible gauge groups k, since for it to be true,
j k have to admit a nontrivial eigenvector vi with eigenvalue 0. this means that either
 or k has to have at least one abelian

the f i
there has to be at least one spectator vector eld ai
factor (both of them together could also be true).

as for the potential, one sees that the u (1)r-gauging introduces a negative contribution
to the total scalar potential so that anti-de sitter solutions might now be possible. in fact,
the experience with the gauged mesgts in [26, 29] and certain truncations of the n = 8
theory [4] make this possibility quite plausible. a more detailed analysis of the potential
and its critical points, however, is now complicated by the additional scalar potential term
g2p induced by the tensor eld dualization and the additional constraints on the v i and
will therefore be given elsewhere [34].

7 allowed gauge groups and the corresponding representa-

tions of the tensor multiplets

in this section we will give a partial classication of the possible gauge groups and the repre-
sentations under which the tensor elds transform. an attempt at a complete classication
will be made elsewhere [34].

we will start our discussion of possible gauge groups with the magical supergravity

theories dened by simple jordan algebras of degree 3.

(i) the largest of the magical n = 2 supergravity theories is dened by the exceptional
jordan algebra with the scalar manifold e6(26)/f4, which we shall refer to as the
exceptional supergravity theory. the exceptional supergravity theory and its coun-
terparts in four and three dimensions share many of the remarkable properties of the
maximally extended supergravity theories in the respective dimensions. in the excep-
tional theory one can gauge the so(6) = su (3, 1) subgroup of the isometry group
e6(26) of the scalar manifold while dualizing twelve of the vector elds into tensor
elds that form a symplectic representation (6 + 6) of so(6). the pure maximal
yang-mills einstein subsector of this theory is the unique unied yang-mills einstein
supergravity in ve dimensions that was studied in [28]. to gauge a u (1)r subgroup
of the r-symmetry su (2)r one needs to break the non-abelian gauge group su (3, 1)
down to a subgroup. one possibility is to gauge the u (1)r such that the su (3) sub-
group of su (3, 1) is unbroken. in this case we obtain a gauged yang-mills einstein
supergravity theory with the gauge group u (1)r  su (3) and 18 tensor multiplets
in the symplectic representation (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3) of su (3). the subsector of
this theory involving only 6 tensor multiplets corresponds to the n = 2 truncation
of the gauged n = 8 theory with the gauge group su (3)  u (1)r [4] which admits
an ads ground state. one can also gauge the subgroup u (1)r such that one has
a vanishing potential p (r). in this case the unbroken non-abelian symmetry is the
su (2, 1) subgroup of su (3, 1) with 18 tensor multiplets.

(ii) the magical n = 2 mesgt dened by the jordan algebra of 33 hermitian matrices
over the quaternions has the scalar manifold su(6)/u sp(6). one can gauge the
so(6) subgroup of the isometry group resulting in the unique unied yang-mills
einstein supergravity [28] with no tensor multiplets. to obtain a yang-mills einstein
supergravity with tensor multiplets one has to gauge a subgroup of so(6). one can
gauge the maximal compact subgroup su (3)  u (1) of so(6) by dualizing 6 of the
vector elds to tensor elds transforming in the symplectic representation (3 + 3) of
su (3)  u (1). one can similarly gauge the non-compact subgroup su (2, 1)  u (1)
of so(6).
in both cases one can use the gauge eld associated with the abelian
factor to gauge the u (1)r symmetry thereby obtaining gauged yang-mills/einstein

15

supergravity theories with the non-abelian gauge groups su (3) and su (2, 1) and six
tensor multiplets, respectively. we expect the generic su (2, 1)  u (1)r gauging to
lead to a vanishing potential p (r).

(iii) the magical mesgt dened by the jordan algebra of 3  3 hermitian matrices over
the complex numbers has the scalar manifold sl(3, c)/su (3). in this theory one can
gauge the full compact symmetry group to obtain a yang-mills/einstein supergravity
theory with the gauge group su (3) [26]. the remaining vector eld( graviphoton)
can be used to gauge the u (1)r symmetry with a non-vanishing potential and an ads
ground state. to obtain a yang-mills einstein supergravity with tensor multiplets one
needs to gauge a subgroup of su (3). one can, for example, gauge the su (2)  u (1)
subgroup while dualizing four of the vector elds to tensor elds in the symplectic
representation (2 + 2). one can then use the graviphoton to obtain a u (1)r gauged
version of this theory. noncompact analogs of these theories also exist with su (3)
and su (2) replaced by sl(3, r) and sl(2, r), respectively.

(iv) the smallest of the magical mesgts has the scalar manifold sl(3, r)/so(3). in
this case one can gauge the sl(2, r) subgroup of the isometry group while dualizing
two of the vector elds into tensor elds. the remaining vector eld can be used to
gauge the u (1)r symmetry.

(v) for the generic jordan family the scalar manifold of the n = 2 mesgt is

so(n  1, 1)  so(1, 1)/so(n  1)

(7.1)

on the other hand the scalar manifold of the generic symmetric non-jordan family is
of the form

so(n, 1)/so(n)

(7.2)

for the latter family, not all the isometries of the scalar manifold can be extended to
symmetries of the lagrangian [33]. only the subgroup [so(n 1) so(1, 1)] t(n1)
( i.e the euclidean group in (n 1) dimensions times dilatations ) of so(n, 1) extends
to a full symmetry of the action. this can simply be understood by the fact that
there is no irreducible symmetric invariant tensor of rank three of so(n, 1).

one can treat the generic jordan and non-jordan families in a unied manner as
was shown in [27]. consider a vector m in an n dimensional euclidean space with
components mi. then the non-vanishing components of the tensor c i j k can be
written in the form (cf. eq. (2.6))

c000 = 1

(7.3)

16

c0ij = 

1
2

ij

m(ijk)  mimjmk

cijk =

2

where i, j, .. = 1, 2, .., n. for the generic jordan family the length squared of the vector
m is two

while for the non-jordan family one has

m  m = 2

m  m =

1
2

.

(7.4)

(7.5)

it is easy to verify that the above cijk can provide a symplectic representation of only
an abelian subgroup of the compact symmetry group of n = 2 mesgt. therefore, if
we are to have tensor elds transforming nontrivially under the compact gauge group
then only products of u (1)s are allowed in the yang-mills einstein supergravity with
tensor multiplets. of course one still has the option to gauge a non-abelian subgroup
of the compact symmetry group so long as the tensor elds are inert under it.

(vi) the scalar manifolds listed above exhaust the list of n = 2 mesgts whose scalar
manifolds are symmetric spaces. in addition there is a large set of other theories whose
scalar manifolds admit isometries that extend to symmetries of the full action. these
include theories whose scalar manifolds are homogeneous spaces as well as those that
are not homogeneous. a complete list of possible homogeneous spaces was given in
[31]. this classication was achieved by showing that the requirement of a transitive
isometry group allows one to bring the most general solution for the symmetric tensor
given in the canonical basis above to the form:

c011 = 1
c0 = 
c1ij = ij
cij = ij

(7.6)

where the indices i are now split such that i = 0, 1, ,i with  = 1, 2, .., q + 1 and
i = 1, 2, .., r. the coecients ij are (q + 1) real r  r matrices that generate a real
cliord algebra of positive signature c(q + 1, 0). the allowed homogeneous (but not
symmetric) spaces are, in general, quotients of parabolic groups g modded out by
their maximal compact subgroups h. the lie algebra g of the group g is a semi-direct
sum:

g = g0  g+1

17

(7.7)

g0 = so(1, 1)  so(q + 1, 1)  sq(p, q)
g+1 = (spinor, vector) ,

(7.8)

where spinor denotes a spinor representation of so(q + 1, 1) (of dimension dq+1) and
vector denotes the vector representation of sq(p, q) which is of dimension (p + q).8
the isotropy group h is
(7.9)
the possible groups sq(p, q) and the associated real cliord algebras were given in
[31] which we list in table 1.

ir , c and ih are the division algebras of
real, complex numbers and quaternions, respectively, while dq+1 denotes the real dimen-
sion of an irreducible representation of the cliord algebra. the sq(p, q) is the metric
preserving group in the centralizer of the cliord algebra in the (p + q)dq+1 dimensional
representation.

now the gamma matrices ij provide a symplectic representation of a group only
for q = 1 or q = 2 i.e for u (1) or su (2). hence one can gauge su (2) symmetry of
the n = 2 mesgt for q = 2 while dualizing the 2p vector elds to tensor elds.
one can then use the remaining two su (2) singlet vector elds to gauge the u (1)r
symmetry and/or the abelian u (1) factor in u (p ) = u (1)  su (p ). for q = 1
one can gauge the so(2, 1) symmetry while dualizing the 2p vector elds into tensor
elds. the remaining so(2, 1) singlet vector eld can then be used to gauge the
u (1)r symmetry of these theories.

8we should note that in case the scalar manifold is a symmetric space the above lie algebra gets extended
by additional symmetry generators belonging to grade 1 space transforming in the conjugate representation
of g+1 with respect to g0.

18

(vii) as is clear from above, the coupling to the tensor elds restricts the possible non-
abelian symmetry groups greatly for those theories whose scalar manifolds are sym-
metric spaces or homogeneous spaces. we would like to point out that there does
exist a novel class of (gauged) n = 2 yang-mills einstein supergravity theories cou-
pled to tensor multiplets with a rich set of possible non-abelian groups that admit
symplectic representations. to construct these theories one simply chooses the arbi-
trary tensor cijk in the canonical basis (2.6) as follows. split the indices i, j, k.. as
i = (i, m ), j = (j, n ), .. where i, j = 1, 2, .., n  1 and m, n, .. = 1, .., 2m and identify
(7.10)

cijk = dijk

cim n = cmin = cm ni = r 3

2

(i)m n = r 3

2

(i)n m

(7.11)

where dijk are the completely symmetric gell-mann d-symbols of a lie group k and
the (i) are the matrices of 2m dimensional symplectic representation of k. now
the d-symbols vanish for all simple groups except for the groups su (n ), n > 2 and
spin(6) which is isomorphic to su (4). for vanishing d-symbols and m = 0 the
cubic form reduces to that of the generic jordan family. thus the theories dened
by non-vanishing cijk = dijk can be considered as the non-trivial generalizations of
the generic jordan family. the rst non-trivial example i.e the case of k = su (3)
d-symbols ( with m = 0) lead to the magical n = 2 mesgt with the scalar manifold
sl(3, c)/su (3). the scalar manifold obtained by taking cijk to be the d-symbols
of su (n ) for n > 3 cannot be a symmetric or homogeneous space. this follows
from the fact that for such theories su (n ) act as isometries of the scalar manifold
that extend to symmetries of the full lagrangian. however,it is clear from the list
of possible homogeneous spaces [31] that it does not include manifolds with such
properties. hence the isometries of the scalar manifolds corresponding to cijk = dijk
for n > 3 in the canonical basis cannot act transitively. this is perhaps expected
from the fact that the number of independent invariants of a group in its adjoint
representation is equal to its rank i.e. the number of casimir operators. the term
involving ij in the cubic form corresponds to the quadratic invariant and the term
involving dijk corresponds to the third order casimir. only for su (3) do they form
a complete set of invariants and the resulting scalar manifold is a symmetric space.
for higher su (n ) (n > 3) one has invariants of order up to n .

as for the symplectic representations i of su (n ), one can , for example, choose the
reducible (n + n) representations corresponding to the standard embedding of u (n )
in u sp(2n ) by taking m = n and n = n 2.

19

8 conclusions

our results imply several interesting conclusions.

whereas the r-symmetry group and the isometry group g of the scalar manifold m are
entangled with each other for n > 2 mesgts, and for simple supergravities for n > 4 the
case n = 2 allows a separate discussion of the gaugings of subgroups of these two groups.
in particular, the issues of the tensor eld dualization and the gravitino coupling to gauge
elds can be completely separated. it turns out that both mechanisms require their own
scalar potential. the potential due to the introduction of the tensor elds is manifestly
non-negative and does therefore not admit an anti-de sitter solution. this is in contrast to
the pure u (1)r-gauging, which involves minimal coupling to the gravitini and leads to an
indenite potential which can sustain anti-de sitter vacua.

combining both types of gauging, one observes surprisingly little interference. in par-
ticular, the scalar potential is just a sum of the two potentials of the individual gaugings.
nevertheless, the analysis of the critical points seems to be more complicated, but is, in
general, expected to allow anti-de sitter solutions [34]. a particular example of such a the-
ory obtained by a truncation of the gauged n = 8 supergravity does admit an ads vacuum
[4].

the introduction of the tensor elds leads to strong constraints on the possible gauge
groups k  g and the representations under which the tensor elds transform. the
simultaneous u (1)r-gauging further restricts these gauge groups k, which is one of the few
places where these two types of gaugings interfere with each other. we gave a list of possible
gauge groups and the corresponding representations of the tensor elds using the known
classication of n = 2 mesgts whose scalar manifolds are symmetric or homogeneous
spaces. we also pointed out the existence of a novel family of n = 2 mesgts whose
scalar manifolds are, in general, not homogenous, but admit su (n ) isometries. the latter
class of theories lead to a richer class of gaugings with some of the vector elds dualized to
tensor elds.
