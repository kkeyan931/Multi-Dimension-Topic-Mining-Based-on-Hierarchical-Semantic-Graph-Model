abstract

we study the 3d eld theory on one d3-brane stretched between (r, s) and (p, q)5-

branes. the boundary conditions are determined from the analysis of ns5 and d5 charges

of the two 5-branes. we carry out the mode expansions for all the elds and identify

the eld theory as maxwell-chern-simons theory. we examine the mass spectrum to

determine the conditions for unbroken supersymmetry (susy) in this eld theory and

compare the results with those from the brane congurations. the spectrum is found

to be invariant under the type iib sl(2, z)-transformation. we also discuss the theory

with matters and its s-dual conguration. the result suggests that the equivalence under

s-duality may be valid if we include all the higher modes in the theories with matters. we

also nd an interesting phenomenon that susy enhancement happens in the eld theory

after dimensional reduction from 3d to 2d.

1 introduction

it is believed that 4d n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) theory is self-dual under

the sl(2, z) transformation. this is consistent with the well-known fact that 4d n = 4

sym is realized as the eld theory on the d3-branes and that d3-branes are self-dual

under the type iib sl(2, z) transformation.

in the same way, it is suggested that 3d n = 4 abelian gauge theory with nf avors
are equivalent in the low energy with u(1)nf1 gauge theory with bi-fundamental mat-

ters [1]. this duality is also realized as the type iib s-duality for the brane conguration

which consists of d3-branes suspended between ns5- or d5-branes [2]. such a realization

of the duality in the 3d eld theory by the brane conguration is also discussed in other

cases [3, 4]. these are all reminiscent of sl(2, z) invariance that 4d n = 4 sym theory

has.

in theories with less supersymmetry (susy), it has been suggested that the eld theory

realized on some brane conguration is equivalent in the low energy to that realized on its

s-dual brane conguration [5]-[7]. except the case of 3d n = 4, there would be quantum

corrections, so it is dicult to prove from the eld theoretic point of view that this kind of

duality is exactly true. it does seem to be likely, and it is quite interesting to understand

the dualities of the eld theories from the string theoretic point of view. there are some

studies on the 3d low-energy eective theories in the strong coupling region [8]-[12], in

which such dualities are mentioned in the eld theory approach.

in this paper, we discuss the eld theory realized on one d3-brane stretched between

(r, s) and (p, q)5-branes which are rotated each other.1 we can treat this as the theory

which has the same matter contents as the 4d n = 4 abelian gauge theory. the bound-

ary conditions are known for ns5-brane and d5-brane with vanishing expectation value

(vev) of rr 0-form gauge eld [2]. by mixing these conditions with the weight of the

two kinds of charges, we determine the boundary condition for the 4d vector eld. by

considering the rotated directions, we can also get boundary condition for the 4d scalars

and fermions. from these boundary conditions and equations of motion in the bulk, we

1the conguration for (r, s) = (0, 1) in our model is also discussed in the analysis of the supergravity

solutions [13] and in matrix theory [14].

1

determine the modes on the d3-brane. in this way, we can identify this eld theory as 3d

maxwell-chern-simons (mcs) theory. we also discuss the possibility to get the boundary

conditions using the near horizon limit of the supergravity solutions for the 5-branes. but

it seems dicult to obtain the correct results because the interactions at the end points

of the d3-brane with the gravity background are ambiguous.

we determine the masses in terms of (p, q), (r, s), the type iib string coupling constant

gs, the vacuum expectation value (vev) c0 of rr 0-form gauge eld and the three angles

corresponding to the relative angles of the two 5-branes. we then nd the relations among

these parameters according to the various susys of this mcs theory. we can compare

these results with those in refs. [15, 6], in which the fraction of remaining susy of the

conguration is discussed from the analysis of the killing spinor in sugra. we nd that

our results are the same as those of [15, 6].

we also study sl(2, z) invariance of the mass spectrum. it turns out that the cs mass

is invariant under sl(2, z) transformation, which is reminiscent of 4d n = 4 sl(2, z)

invariance.

we also discuss the theories with matters by adding d5-branes to the above cong-

uration. this theory is mcs gauge theory with avors. it is interesting to examine if

this mcs theory with matters and its s-dual theory are equivalent in the low energy,

as the examples discussed in ref. [2]. the s-dual theory can be read o from the brane

conguration transformed from the original one. we nd that there are some ambiguous

points in the s-dual theory; the theory is almost n = 4 abelian gauge theory with avors

if we ignore the interactions between fundamental matters and heavy modes. the point

is that we have to be careful because a naive eld theory limit changes the structure of

the moduli space when we keep elds with non-zero masses. this means that we have to

include the eects of all the higher modes in order for these massive theories related with

each other by s-transformation to be equivalent in the low energy.

this paper is organized as follows.

in section 2, we discuss the derivation of the

boundary conditions and the identication of the eld theory using the method of mode

expansion.

in section 3, we study the conditions for susys from the masses which

are determined by the parameters (p, q), (r, s), gs and c0 in the previous section and

compare those relations with the conditions for susys of this theory from sugra. in

2

section 4, we discuss how the spectrum changes under type iib sl(2, z) transformation.

in section 5, we study theories with matter and their s-dual conguration. in section 6,

we add comments on interesting phenomena that susy enhancement happens in the

eld theory after dimensional reduction from 3d to 2d. in section 7, we summarize our

conclusions and discuss related issues and some unsolved problems.

2 boundary condition and mode expansions

2.1 brane congurations in type iib and m-theory

our brane conguration consists of two 5-branes and one d3-brane. this d3-brane is

suspended between the two 5-branes and one of its world-volume is nite. we dene

the directions of the d3 world-volume as (x0, x1, x2, x6), in which the x6 direction has

nite length l. one of the two 5-branes is (r, s)5-brane which has r r-r charges and s

ns-ns charges. its world-volume is (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5) and is located at x6 = 0. the

other 5-brane is (p, q)5-brane whose world-volume is in the rotated directions in x3-x7,
x4-x8 and x5-x9 planes by three angles 1, 2 and 3 relatively with the (r, s)5-brane. this
(p, q)5-brane is located at x6 = l (see fig. 1).

in summary, the branes we discuss below are

 d3-brane (x0, x1, x2, x6),
 (r, s)5-brane (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5),
 (p, q)5-brane (x0, x1, x2, x3 cos 1 + x7 sin 1, x4 cos 2 + x8 sin 2, x5 cos 3 + x9 sin 3)

at x3,4,5 = x7,8,9 = 0,

at x6 = x7,8,9 = 0,

at x6 = l and xk+4 cos k2  xk sin k2 = 0,

(k = 3, 4, 5).

in the following, we will study how our (r, s)5-brane can be represented as a 5-brane in

m-theory. for (p, q)5-brane, we can understand from the case of (r, s)5-brane by replacing
(r, s) with (p, q) and {xk, xk+4} with {xk cos k2 +xk+4 sin k2, xk+4 cos k2xk sin k2}
for k = 3, 4, 5.

let us consider an m5-brane whose world-volume is (x0, x1, x2 cos a+x10 sin a, x3, x4, x5).

we can get the type iib 5-brane from this m5-brane by compactifying the two directions

where r2 and r10 are the radii of the compactied x2 and x10, respectively, and  is the

angle which represents the rotation between the direction of x2 and the direction which
has periodicity due to the compactication (see fig. 2), denoted as x2. if we shrink r10
and take t-duality in the direction of x2, we get type iib theory. in terms of the type
iib string coupling constant gs  r10
and the vev c0  tan /gs of rr 0-form, we can
also write this complex structure as  = c0 + i

on this torus, we can depict the type iib (r, s)5-brane as the m5-brane wrapping x2

s times and x10 r times. we thus set a as

the corresponding angle b for (p, q)5-brane is dened by replacing (r, s) with (p, q). as

a result, our brane conguration can be expressed in m-theory as

by analyzing the killing spinors for the above three kinds of m-branes, the conditions

for the unbroken susy have been obtained in [6] (see also [15], in which the authors

study the unbroken susy of the two rotated m5-branes). the results are summarized as

follows:

 1

16 susy (3d n = 1): |a  b| = |1  2  3|,
8 susy (3d n = 2): |a  b| = |i|, |j| = |k|, (i, j, k) = (1, 2, 3),
16 susy (3d n = 3): |a  b| = |1| = |2| = |3|.

2.2 mode expansions for vector elds

in this section, we will derive the mode expansions for the vector elds on the d3-brane

from the boundary conditions which we derive now. let us rst consider the 4d eld

theory on the d3-brane whose world-volume is separated by ns5-brane or d5-brane.

this is the case discussed in [2]. the action for the 4d gauge eld with zero vev of rr

0-form is given as

z d3xdx6"

1
4g2

y m4

fmnf mn# ,

(3)

where d3x  dx0dx1dx2, m and n run over 0, 1, 2, 6, and gy m4 is the 4d gauge coupling
constant in 4d n = 4 sym and is related to the string coupling constant by g2
y m4 =

2gs [17].

actually the theories are conned to the region 0  x6  l by the two 5-branes.
we are then left with surface terms from the boundaries of x6 coordinate in making the

5

variation of the action with respect to a. from the variation in the above action, we

nd the surface term

z d3xa 1

g2
y m4

f6,

(4)

at the boundaries in the x6 direction. these must vanish by themselves. hanany and

witten suggest that the boundary condition is f = 0 (,  = 0, 1, 2) for d5-brane from
the gauge invariant representation of a = 0 and f6 = 0 for ns5-brane [2].

now the question is what happens if there is non-zero vev of rr 0-form in the above

conguration. the action for the 4d gauge eld with non-zero vev of rr 0-form is given

by

z d3xdx6h 

1
4g2

y m4

fmnf mn +

c0
4

6f6fi,

(5)

where , , and  run over 0, 1, 2. from the variation of this action, by the same procedure

as above, we are led to the boundary conditions

1
gs

f6 + c0

1
2
1
2

f  = 0 for ns5,

f  = 0 for d5.

(6)

(7)

note that the boundary condition on ns5-brane is changed and mixed with that of d5-

brane, but the boundary condition on d5-brane is unchanged. in fact, for non-zero value

of c0, ns5-brane comes to have d5 charge by c0 in addition to unit ns5 charge. this

is expressed as [c0, 1] in the charge lattice, which can be seen fig. 2 by counting the
winding numbers in the directions of x10 and x2, and by using the relation, c0 = r2 tan 

.

r10

this is a phenomenon similar to witten eect in 4d eld theory [18]. on the other hand,

d5-brane has only one d5 charge, expressed as [1, 0], and its charge is not aected by

non-zero c0. so we expect that boundary condition for the 5-brane is given by mixing

these two kinds of boundary conditions at the rate of the charges that the 5-brane has.

for (r, s)5-brane with non zero c0, the charge can be expressed as [sc0 + r, s]. we thus
expect that the boundary condition can be obtained by replacing c0 in (6) by c0 + r
s :

1
gs

f6 + (c0 +

r
s

)

1
2

f  = 0.

(8)

this also includes the boundary condition for d5-brane, as can be seen by putting (r, s) =
(1, 0). the term with the coecient r

s may be understood as coming from the condensation

6

on the (r, s)5-brane just as the case of the fundamental string boundary condition on the

bound state of d-branes. for (p, q)5-brane, we obtain the condition by replacing (r, s) by

(p, q). therefore in our model, we get the boundary conditions for the vector eld as

f6 + (c0 +

f6 + (c0 +

1
2
1
2

f  = 0,

at x6 = 0,

f  = 0,

at x6 = l.

let us discuss the spectrum under these boundary conditions. using (2) and

tan a = (

r
s

+ c0)gs,

tan b = (

p
q

+ c0)gs,

we can expand the 4d gauge elds as

a =

a6 =



xn=

a(n)
 cos[(a  b + n)

a(n)

sin[(a  b + n)

l  a],
x6
l  a],

(9)

(10)

(11)

up to gauge transformation. here we denote by a(n)

 and a(n)

6

the elds which depend on

only 3d coordinates x0, x1, x2. these expansions lead to the following representations for

the 4d eld strengths:

f =

f (n)
 cos[(a  b + n)

f6 =

f (n)
6 sin[(a  b + n)
6  a(n)
satisfy the boundary conditions (9) if we set

  a(n)

  a(n)

6 + (ab+n)

where f (n)





xn=
xn=
 and f (n)

x6

x6
l  a],

(12)

l

a(n)
 . these mode expansions

f (n)
6 =

1
2

f (n).

(13)

in addition to the boundary conditions, these modes have to satisfy the equations of

motion in 4d on the d3-brane. these equations can be expressed in terms of the corre-

sponding modes as2

f  + 6f 6 = 0  f (n) 

(a  b + n)

l

f 6(n) = 0,

f 6 = 0  f 6(n) = 0.

2the 4d anomaly term does not contribute to the equation of motion.

(14)

(15)

obviously eq. (15) is satised due to eq. (13). for (14), we nd

f (n) = (f (n)

by eliminating a(n)

2.3 comments on boundary conditions from supergravity solu-

tion

let us examine the possibility to obtain the boundary condition for the vector eld from

the supergravity solution of the 5-brane. the classical solution for type iib (r, s)5-brane

can be obtained from the solution of m5-brane following the procedure of [20]. the type

iib (r, s)5-brane solution is3

where r is dened by r2 = x2

rr 0-form gauge eld and dilaton by  and , respectively. note that the asymptotic

7 + x2

8 + x2

6 + x2

value of the axion  is c0, as it should be. of course, there are backgrounds also for

nsns 2-form, rr 2-form and rr 4-form, but we will not need their explicit forms below.

for (p, q)5-brane, we can get the solution from that of (r, s)5-brane by replacing (r, s)
with (p, q) and {xk, xk+4} with {xk cos k2 + xk+4 sin k2, xk+4 cos k2  xk sin k2} for
k = 3, 4, 5.

we can consider that the gravitational elds (graviton, dilaton, rr-gauge elds) are

weakly coupled to the elds of 4d n = 4 sym theory. these gravity elds come from the

(p, q) and (r, s)5-branes on the ends of the d3-brane and we treat these as the external

, where e is the energy scale of the theory we are

elds and approximate them by the classical sugra solution. we consider this system
in the parameter region gs  1, e  1
studying now, such as 3d sym gauge coupling. this is the eld theory limit, in which
3the compactication in fig. 2 is facilitated by the identication (x2, x10)  (x2, x10) +

we can neglect the gravitational interactions and the corrections containing the powers of

 and space-time is almost at. near 5-branes on both the ends of the d3-brane, where

the distance from the 5-brane r is much less than lsqq(r, s), we have to take account of

the gravitational eects as we can see from the form of the sugra solution. so when we

make the variation of the 4d n = 4 action weakly coupled to the gravity, it seems a good

approximation to treat the equations of motion in the bulk as those in the at background

and derive the boundary conditions near each 5-brane in the limit r  lsqq(r, s) of the

sugra solution.

let us consider the action for the gauge eld coupled with gravity:

efmnf mn +

(x6)

4

6f6fi,

(23)

where g = qi=0,1,2,6 gii. using the above supergravity solution, we see the coecient of
fmnf mn reduces to the constant  1
since the theory is conned to the region 0  x6  l by the two 5-branes, from the

8gs

.

variation of the above action, we nd the surface terms

at x6 = 0 and x6 = l. these must vanish by themselves. we nd that our boundary

conditions are obtained by requiring that the square bracket in eq. (24) vanish at x6 = 0

and x6 = l. thus we get

these conditions are dierent from those in (9). what is the reason for the dierence and

which are correct? in the present method using supergravity solutions, we have simply

taken the (r, s)5-brane solution (22) and used its values at the boundaries. this is the

so-called probe method. however, this neglects the contribution from the interaction

between each 5-brane and the d3-brane at the end point of the d3-brane. also there

may be additional contributions from the dierence between the equations of motion near

the boundaries and in the bulk at background. for these reasons, we believe that the

derivation of the boundary conditions based on the 5-brane charges are more reliable.

the boundary conditions in (9) also give sl(2, z)-invariant spectrum, as we will discuss

in section 4, and this gives another evidence that they are the correct ones.

2.4 mode expansions for other elds

next let us consider the scalar elds. the boundary conditions for those are the general-

ization of those in ref. [2]. it is argued that the scalar  corresponding to the uctuations

in the direction along the 5-brane world-volume should have neumann boundary condi-

tion 6 = 0 and those in the orthogonal directions dirichlet condition  = 0. the
conditions in our model at x6 = 0 are thus

6x l = 0,

x l+4 = 0, at x6 = 0,

and those at x6 = l are

6[x l cos l2 + x l+4 sin l2] = 0,
[x l sin l2 + x l+4 cos l2] = 0, at x6 = l,

(28)

(29)

where l = 3, 4, 5. for the above boundary conditions, we can make the mode expansions

xk+2 =



xn=

(n)

k cos[(k + n)

x6

sin[(k + n)

l

],

(30)

where k = 1, 2, 3, and {(n)
k } are the real scalar elds in 3d and depend only on x0, x1, x2.
substituting these expressions into x 3, x 4, x 5, x 7, x 8, x 9 in the original 4d action (see

the appendix for the kinetic term of a complex scalar (two real scalars) in 4d), we get

.

this is the 3d massive scalar eld theory with mass (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

finally let us discuss the fermions. there are four 4d weyl fermions which have

the origin in the 4d n = 4 abelian eld theory on the d3-brane. these four fermions

transform as spinor representation under so(6) r-transformation. because of the relation
so(6)  su(4), they transform as fundamental representation of su(4). the 4d four
fermions in our model have the rotated boundary conditions which can be obtained by

transforming those for the unrotated case.

for the unrotated case, we make the variation of the fermion kinetic terms with respect

to each fermion and get

2  2 = 0,

(32)

on the boundary, where 2 = 2. here 2 stands for the pauli matrix in the x6 direction.4
these conditions mean that  = . if we decompose  as  = 3 r+iim2
, where r and
im are real spinors, we obtain the boundary condition im = 0 for + or r = 0 for .
we choose the boundary condition im = 0 below.

in our model, we decompose the four 4d weyl spinors i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) into four pairs

of real spinors as

l2 =

3 (l + il+4)

2

,

4 =

3 (2 + i10)

2

,

(33)

where l = 3, 4, 5. these combinations and indices are dened so as to correspond to the
rotations of the 5-brane in the planes x3-x7, x4-x8 and x5-x9 by 1, 2 and 3. each i

(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) transforms like i  eiii, where p4

4in the appendix we discuss the dimensional reduction from 4d n = 2 sym to 3d n = 4 sym.

i=1 i = 0 from the traceless condition

12

for su(4). our above choice of the boundary conditions leads to imi = 0 at x6 = 0 and

im(cid:16)eiii(cid:17) = 0 at x6 = l. we obtain

7 = 8 = 9 = 10 = 0, at x6 = 0,

and

l sin l2 + l+4 cos l2 = 0,
2 sin 4 + 10 cos 4 = 0, at x6 = l.

(l = 3, 4, 5),

(34)

(35)

to satisfy these boundary conditions, we expand 4d real fermions in terms of 3d

majorana fermions as5

in summary, we have derived the 3d action containing vector elds, real scalar elds

and majorana fermions. they are all massive and have innite sequences of higher modes.

let us consider the theory in the limit that the higher modes decouple, in addition

to taking the eld theory limit, gs  1, e  1
theory we are studying now, such as the 3d sym gauge coupling constant g2

, where e is the energy scale of the eld
y m3 = 2gs
l .
5precisely speaking, we also have to consider the equations of motion for the 4d weyl fermions as the

ls

case of the vector eld. we use here short-cut approach.

13

namely we consider our theory in the following parameter region:

(38)

where k = 1, . . . , 4. suppose that we integrate out all the higher modes with masses much

larger than e which is the energy scale of the eld theory in our consideration. we are

then left with a theory which consists of only n = 0 modes:

where the index (n = 0) on each eld are suppressed. we call this limit the lowest mode

limit in what follows.

3 condition for supersymmetry

in this section, we discuss the number of unbroken susy in our theories described by

the action (39). the conditions of the unbroken susy change according to the various

relations among the masses. on the other hand, it is known from the analysis of the

branes in m-theory which appear in our conguration that the four relative angles in

the two m5-branes determine the unbroken susy in this conguration [15, 6]. we can

compare these conditions for susy with those obtained from the analysis of the eld

theory on the d3-brane.6

let us study the theory (39) in the point of the susy. the combinations (k,k),

(k = 1, 2, 3) become 3d n = 1 susy multiplets as we can see from the fact that they

while the fourth fermion

have the same mass (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
l(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
4 has the mass (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

4

k

l(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

. but the gauge eld has mass (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

ab

l

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

. these two masses are dierent in general, which means that there is

6there is no unique way to determine the signs of the fermion mass terms. when we change the signs

for the majorana fermion in the denition (33), we can get the action with dierent signs for the fermion

mass terms.

14

no unbroken susy. if these two masses are the same, they constitute a 3d n = 1 gauge

multiplet and we have at least 3d n = 1 susy. thus the condition for 3d n = 1 susy

is

|4| = |1 + 2 + 3| = |a  b|.

note that we can express |a  b| in terms of (r, s), (p, q), gs and c0 as

(40)

(41)

|tan(a  b)| = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

qr  ps

gs(pr + sq||2) + c0gs(ps + qr)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

the condition for susy (40) is in agreement with the result in the m-theory summarized

in subsection 2.1 for 3d n = 1, that is, 1/16 susy in terms of the original 10d n = 2

theory.

the discussions in refs. [15, 6] are based on the analysis of the system of two relatively

rotated m5-branes and an m2-brane, in which they are treated as m-branes with innite

world-volumes. as a result, the contribution of the boundary of the m2-brane and of the

intersections between m5-branes and m2-brane could be neglected. if we do not have such

intersections in our conguration, the same susy is expected when we reduce the system

with the two m5-branes and one m2-brane to that in iia theory and convert it into the

system in iib theory by t-duality. the vev of rr 0-form c0 has no eects on the eld
theory on the d3-brane with innite world-volume because the anomaly term f  f is a
total derivative and topologically trivial in 4d abelian theory. but if one direction of the

d3-brane is nite by the existence of the intersections, this anomaly term does not vanish

and might cause some discrepancy between the eld theory and m-theory analyses. the

above result shows that such discrepancy does not actually appear.

we can also derive the conditions for more susy from the relations among the masses

of the four 3d n = 1 multiplets. for example, if two of them and the rest are the same

|1| = |a  b| ,

|2| = |3|,

(42)

then we have 3d n = 2 susy. in this case, we have one n = 2 massive vector multiplet
with mass |1|l and one n = 2 massive hypermultiplet with mass |2|l . this condition for
1/8 susy is again the same as the m-theory analysis in refs. [15, 6].

moreover if all the four masses are the same

|a  b| = |1| = |2| = |3|,

(43)

15

we have 3d n = 3 susy. 3d n = 3 elds consist of one n = 2 massive vector multiplet

and one n = 2 massive hypermultiplet with the same mass. here also we reproduce the

same result as that of [15, 6].7

4 sl(2, z) transformation and spectrum

let us discuss the invariance under the sl(2, z) transformation of the type iib brane

conguration. the boundary condition (9) for the gauge eld has the t-invariance under

  r
s!    r  s
s ! ,

  p
q!    p  q
q ! ,

c0  c0 + 1,

but the s-invariance under

s!    s

r! ,

  p
q!    q

p! ,

,

(44)

(45)

is not so apparent. if there is any invariance of the spectrum under the sl(2, z) trans-

formation, it would be the reection of the sl(2, z) invariance in the 4d n = 4 abelian

gauge theory realized on one d3-brane.

let us consider the mass spectrum in our theory. the masses of the scalars and the

fermions are invariant under the sl(2, z) transformation. it is the mass of the gauge

eld that may change under this transformation. we see that this mass is determined by

the relative angle of the two m5-brane in the x2-x10 plane. the relative angle is sl(2, z)

invariant, so we can conclude our spectrum are invariant under sl(2, z) transformation.

in fact this can also be conrmed by direct calculation using the transformation

 

a + b

where a, b, c and d are integers and satisfy ad  bc = 1.

7in 3d n = 3 mcs theory, one of the four fermion mass terms has dierent sign from those of

the other three masses [21] (also see the appendix). we can adjust the sign of the mass term in our

model by changing the sign of the 3d majorana fermion in the denition (33). for example, when
we change the sign of 4 as 4  4 in (33), we get the same action as [21] under the condition
a  b = 1 = 2 = 3 = 4. only 1 has dierent sign in the mass term from those of the other
fermions.

5 comments on the theories with fundamental mat-

ters

we have considered the theories without matter until now. here we study briey how the

theories with matters8 are changed, compared with those without matters. for simplicity,

we set c0 to zero below.

the matters in the (anti-)fundamental representation can be expressed by the open

strings stretched between the d3-brane and d5-branes which have the world-volume

(x0, x1, x2, x7, x8, x9). so we need to add some d5-branes in addition to the congu-

ration we have discussed. we consider the case with two d5-branes as a simple example.

moreover we will discuss below theories without mass terms for the (anti-)fundamentals

and fayet-iliopoulos terms. we also put (r, s) = (0, 1), in which the condition for susy

is the same as that without matter; d5-branes give no additional condition for the susy

in the conguration we have discussed. the corresponding eld theory is massive (mcs)

abelian gauge theory with two fundamental matters. the bosonic part of the action for

the avors [24, 25] is

where l is the index for the two avors, and ql and ql are the fundamental and anti-

fundamental matters, respectively. here gy m3 is the 3d gauge coupling constant given by
y m3 = 2gs
g2
l . the above action is the same as that for 3d n = 4 charged hypermultiplets
except the terms containing the angles.

compared with ref. [2], there is no coulomb branch (moduli) parameterized by the

vev of the adjoint elds, because they are all massive elds and cannot get vev. in the

brane conguration, this corresponds to the fact that the d3-brane cannot move in the

directions of x3,4,5. if the vevs of the fundamental matters are zero, the gauge coupling

goes to the strong coupling region in the low energy and this cs theory may become

8this case has also been discussed in the literature [6, 22, 23].

another phase in this theory is the higgs, in which the vevs of the (anti-)fundamentals

are non-zero and the gauge symmetry is broken. this vacuum is described by k = 0 and
l=1 ql kql = 0, where k = 1, 2, 3. this phase can be expressed by the brane congu-
p2
ration in which the d3-brane is broken into three pieces separated by the two d5-branes

and the second (middle) piece between the two d5-branes is away from the other two

pieces along the directions x7, x8 and x9 of the world-volume of the d5-branes (see figs. 3

and 4). this analysis is classical, so there may be quantum corrections.

let us discuss the s-transformation of this theory. by s-transformation, the above

conguration changes into that in which ns5-brane, (p, q)5-brane and two d5-branes are
replaced by d5-brane, (q,p)5-brane and two ns5-branes, respectively. the eld theory
on this s-dual conguration is the abelian gauge theory coming from the second (middle)

d3-brane between the two ns5-branes. there are also two charged avors with respect

to this abelian gauge symmetry. they originate from the open strings stretched between

the second d3-brane and the rst (left), and between the second d3-brane and the third
(right). their interaction terms take the same form as those in (47) with k

l = 0, the same
as the n=4 interaction terms. in addition, the matter eld corresponding to the string

stretched between the second d3-brane and the third is also charged with respect to the

9see [26] in which non-supersymmetric mcs theory with matters is discussed. it is expected to be

the same in the cases of n = 1 and n = 2. for n = 3, little is known about the phase in the strong

coupling.

masses. the bosonic part of the action11 for the avors in the s-dual theory is then

stretching between the second d3-brane and the rst, and the second d3-brane and the

addition to those, b2 couples to the heavy mcs elds (c, k) on the third d3 with large

10the eld theory on the rst d3-brane is 3d n = 4 proca eld theory and there is no gauge symmetry.

this proca eld comes from the dierent mode expansion from (11), because in the case of a = 0 and
b = 

2 , we can not apply the same mode expansion as (11).

simple case.

the lowest mode limit (38) is nothing but the limit k   in the above. if we simply
k(cid:17), we get the same action as that
take the limit and ignore the interaction terms of o(cid:16) 1

for 3d n = 4 susy. this appears to be inconsistent with the susy in the eld theory

realized on the original brane conguration. on the other hand, if we keep the terms
of a, b2 and k suppressed by the inverse of the large masses k after the integration,
the susy would be the same as before the integration. due to these two possibilities in

the treatment of heavy modes, the higgs branch is ambiguous as follows. if we keep the

higher order terms, we can easily check that there is no higgs branch because there is no
vacuum with non-zero vevs for the fundamentals and k =  = 0 in the action (48).
this is consistent with the fact that the original eld theory does not have the (would-be

corresponding) coulomb branch. if we simply ignore the higher order terms, the higgs

branch exists just as in ref. [2]. all of this suggests that we have to consider all the mcs

higher modes without taking the lowest mode limit for the equivalence of the two theories

related by the s-transformation. this is a complication that arises when we keep elds

with non-zero masses.

whatever the higgs branch is, we can easily see that in this s-dual eld theory, there
is a coulomb branch parameterized by non-zero k with bl = 0 and k = 0. this phase
is expressed by the brane conguration in which the second d3-brane between the two

ns5-branes is away from the other two pieces along the directions x7, x8 and x9 of the

world-volume of the ns5-branes (see fig.4).

12 in the s-dual conguration, we keep the (dual) gauge coupling constants xed in this limit. this
y m3   in the original conguration. in the same way, the dual gauge coupling
y m3 xed in the original conguration. this is

means gs   and g2
constants become large in the case of gs  0 keeping g2
the original reason why we come to need all the mcs higher modes for the duality correspondence.

20

we have classically studied the theory with fundamental matters and their s-dual

theory.

it is dicult to calculate the quantum corrections exactly, so we cannot say

denitely whether these two theories are exactly equivalent in the low energy where the

distances between the 5-branes do not appear. however, at least at the classical level,

the higgs branch of the original eld theory seems to correspond to the coulomb branch

of its s-dual theory, as is seen from the brane conguration. if the two theories related

by s-duality are the same theory in the low energy, probably all the mcs higher modes

must be included.

6 reduction to 2d and susy enhancement

in this section, we turn to the 2d theory which is obtained from (39) by dimensional

reduction in the x2 direction.13 this theory is realized on the d2-brane between two

ns5-d4 bound states. this type iia conguration is related by t-duality to our type

iib brane conguration that we have discussed.

let us focus on the case 3d n = 3 susy. we start with the action (39) under the

condition (43). after adjusting the sign of the mass terms by changing the sign of the 3d

majorana fermion in the denition (33), we can write 3d n = 3 action in the well-known

form [21] (see the appendix for details)

this is the sigma model action with 2d (4,4) susy, that is, 1/4 susy compared with

10d n = 2 theory. the susy is enhanced from 3/16 to 1/4 after dimensional reduction.

it is crucial that as far as the degrees of freedom are concerned, there is no dierence

between 2d n = (4, 4) vector multiplet and 2d n = (4, 4) neutral hypermultiplet except

that the vector multiplet has the gauge eld without physical propagating modes; both

of them consist of four real scalars and four fermions. the dierence appears when the

gauge interaction term exists. to keep these gauge interaction terms invariant under 2d

n = (4, 4) transformation, the vector multiplet must be massless. so we cannot construct

massive gauge theory with unbroken gauge symmetry in 2d n = (4, 4) theory.14 but in

our case, the 3d n = 3 massive vector multiplet reduces to 2d n = (4, 4) massive

hypermultiplet. this happens only in abelian gauge theory without charged matters.

there is no gauge interaction in this theory. for non-abelian gauge theory, 3d n = 3 eld

theory reduces to 2d (3,3) non-abelian gauge theory with some complicated interactions

as well as the mass term for the gauge eld. in the same way, the 3d n = 3 mcs theory

with fundamental matters reduces to 2d (3,3) eld theory with fundamental matters.

these two n = 3 theories have gauge interactions, so the susy enhancement never

occurs.

from the above calculations of the reduction from 3d to 2d, we can say that this

susy enhancement is accidental in 2d abelian eld theory due to the existence of the

14there is one special case in which we may expect 2d n = (4, 4) massive gauge theory. some kind

of 3d gauge theory with bf term is known to have n = 4 susy. this theory does not have kinetic

terms for the fermions. if we reduce this theory to 2d, we expect 2d (4,4) susy (see [12] and references

therein).

chiral transformation. this is the symmetry in 2d n = (4, 4) abelian gauge theory, but

not in 2d n = (4, 4) non-abelian or 3d n = 4 (massless) gauge theory (both for abelian

and non-abelian). on the other hand, the 3d cs term breaks one of the four susy and

is also not invariant under this kind of chiral transformation. when we reduce this term

from 3d to 2d, the broken susy transformation combined with the chiral transformation

keeps the reduced cs term as well as 2d (4,4) abelian action invariant.15 what we have

found is that this transformation becomes the new susy transformation and susy is

enhanced.

on the other hand, the susy of the brane conguration which realizes this 2d (4,4)

massive theory is expected to be 3/16 [15, 6]. if we consider the gravity elds as well,

we expect this kind of enhancement does not occur in this sector and the susy remains

3/16.

7 conclusions and discussions

we have discussed the spectrum of the theory on the d3-brane separated between (r, s)

and (p, q)5-branes. one of these 5-branes have rotated world-volumes with the three

relative angles compared with the other. we regard this theory as the partially broken

4d n = 4 theory by the boundary conditions. assuming that the boundary conditions

for the gauge eld are determined by mixing the boundary conditions for the ns5-brane

with vanishing vev of rr 0-form gauge eld and that for d5-brane at the rate of ns5

and d5 charges, we obtain the boundary conditions on the intersections of the d3-brane

and (r, s) or (p, q)5-branes. we also get the boundary conditions for the scalars and

fermions by considering the direction of the rotated 5-brane world volume. we then nd

the modes which obey the boundary conditions as well as the equations of motion for

the 4d abelian elds on the d3-brane. from these modes we read o the 3d mass

terms, which enable us to study the conditions for susy and the invariance under the

type iib sl(2, z) transformation. we have found that the results for susy are the

same as those in ref. [15, 6] in which the susy conditions are determined by the four

relative angles of the rotated two m5-branes. we have also found that this theory has

15in the appendix, this is shown for the abelian eld theory with the o-shell susy.

23

the sl(2, z) invariance. the masses we have obtained are determined by the sl(2, z)-

invariant relative angles of the two 5-branes, so the sl(2, z) invariance manifests itself

even though the boundary conditions themselves are not manifestly invariant.

we have also discussed the case with matters by adding d5-branes. we can easily

get its s-dual conguration, but identication of this s-dual eld theory involves some

ambiguity. the naive lowest mode limit in this theory is the 3d n = 4 eld theory,

which appears to be in conict with the the eld theory with less susy of the original

brane conguration. one possibility is that we have to include the contribution of the

mcs higher modes without taking the lowest mode limit in order that these two theories

are equivalent in the low energy where the distances between the 5-branes do not appear.

that is, it is only in special cases such as 3d n = 4 [2] that these two theories after

taking the lowest mode limit are equivalent, and in general we need all the higher modes

when we also include massive adjoint elds.

we have discussed only the case of one d3-brane, that is, abelian theory. how about

the non-abelian theory? the boundary conditions are then non-linear, and it is dicult,

if not impossible, to carry out the mode expansions as we have done for abelian. as a

result, it is premature to draw any denite conclusion about the non-abelian theories.

intuitively, it seems that the eld theory on the multiple d3-branes is 3d non-abelian

cs theory by the analogy with the abelian theories. but there are the problems to be

solved such as the quantization of the cs coecient or the constraint of s-rule.

in ref. [6], it has been argued that for c0 = 0 and (r, s) = (0, 1) in our model, there are

wilson lines whose vevs are limited to the p dierent values. this observation is based

on the fact that in t 2 (x2-x10) compactied m-theory point of view, there are p dierent

positions on the m5-brane (corresponding to the (p, q)5-brane) to connect the other m5-

brane (corresponding to (0,1)5-brane (ns5-brane)) by the m2-brane. these p dierent

positions in the compactied direction of x2 correspond to the vevs of the adjoint eld

x2 in the iia theory. this would require some potential terms for x2 in the type iia

picture. after t-dual transformation, the vevs of x2 would turn into the wilson lines

in the type iib theory. in ref. [6], it is suggested that the cs coecient may explain the

existence of these p vacua. on the other hand, the eld theoretic analysis in this paper is

based on the boundary conditions derived by mixing those for d5- and ns5-branes at the

24

rate of the charges and we believe that these conditions are the most natural ones from

the eld theory viewpoint. however, this analysis does not seem to indicate the existence

of such wilson lines and there is no indication of the potential in t-dualized theory within

our iib boundary conditions. it shows that there are many 3d cs gauge elds with heavy

cs mass terms (large cs coecient). it seems dicult to connect the cs coecient to

the p vacua without taking this into account. there is a single vacuum in our 3d mcs

theory, but this fact seems to be in contradiction to the above p vacua originated from

m-theory. it is possible that the information about p dierent vacua might be dropped in

the process from m-theory to type iib theory. if we can nd boundary conditions which

reect such information coming from m-theory, we might construct 3d eld theory that

has these p dierent vacua. that will be a complicated theory. how to determine this

theory is an interesting subject left for future study.

appendix

in this appendix, we will explain our notations in this paper and the method of the

dimensional reduction. we show how to obtain 3d n = 4 action by dimensional reduction

from 4d n = 2 sym as an example. we also exhibit the 4d n = 2 and 3d n = 4 susy

transformation, some of which remain unbroken in our model. our notations in 4d sym

are those of [27] in which 4d n = 1 is discussed in detail in the superspace formalism.

we discuss su(nc) gauge theory, the abelian case being straightforward.

this cs term. the transformation by 0 is broken by this cs term. in the abelian case,

where d4  f01, c4  a2 and 4   and  runs over 0 and 1. of course, this is invariant
under the original 2d (3,3) susy transformations. after we replace k (k = 1, . . . , 4) by
2k in the 0 transformation reduced from 3d to 2d, we get

where i = 1, 2, 3. under this transformation, we nd that the 2d massive lagrangian (60)

is invariant. this is the new susy transformation besides the original 2d (3,3) susy

and the 2d massive theory described by (60) has 2d (4,4) susy.
