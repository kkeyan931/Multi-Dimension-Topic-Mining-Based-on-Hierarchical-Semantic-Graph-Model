abstract. we show the existence of a renormalizable local supersymmetry for the gauge xed
action of the four dimensional antisymmetric tensor eld model in a curved background quantized
in a generalized axial gauge. by using the technique of the algebraic renormalization procedure,
we prove the ultraviolet niteness of the model to all orders of perturbation theory.

1 introduction

in [1] the authors have shown that the four dimensional antisymmetric tensor eld model,
quantized in a curved background admitting killing vectors1, was anomaly free and nite
to all orders of perturbation theory. in this work we generalize the results of [1] to be
valid for manifolds not necessarily admitting killing vectors.
in order to avoid the diculties the authors met in [1, 2], we introduce a vector eld
n(x) which will play the role of a generalized axial gauge vector in curved space-time.
in fact, from the beginning we choose the manifold m, on which the four dimensional
antisymmetric tensor eld model is discussed, to have a trivial topology. in particular,
this means that the gauge vector eld n(x) can be chosen to be nowhere vanishing.

in the present paper we show, using the algebraic renormalization techniques [3, 4, 5],
that the model is anomaly free and nite to all orders of perturbation theory. in section
2 we describe the model as well as its gauge xing. in section 3 we display the superdif-
feomorphisms transformations. section 4 is devoted to the o-shell analysis of the theory
and nally the stability as well as the anomaly analysis are performed in section 5.

2 the model

we begin with the classical action of the four dimensional antisymmetric eld model in
curved space-time:

sinv =

where aa
 is the gauge eld. all elds are lie algebra valued and belong to the adjoint
representation of some compact semi-simple gauge group g whose structure constants
f abc are completely antisymmetric in their indices. the generators of the lie algebra are
chosen to be anti-hermitian and fullling [t a, t b] = f abct c and tr(t at b) = ab. finally,

behaves like a scalar density of weight +1 and the volume element d4x has weight 1. the levi-civita
tensor density  has weight +1 and its inverse

carries weight 1.

where a is the local gauge parameter and a
 is a local vector parameter. d represents
the covariant derivative.
in order to x the gauge consistently we use a generalized
axial3 gauge type with a local vector n(x). in fact, we will quantize the model on a four
dimensional manifold which is assumed to be topologically trivial and asymptotically at.
therefore, we can choose n(x) to be a nowhere vanishing local vector. hence, the gauge
xing part of the action, which is metric dependent and therefore destroys the topological
character of the model, reads:

contrary to [1], gauge-xing the four dimensional antisymmetric tensor eld model using
the generalized axial gauge is much simpler than using the landau gauge such that (2.5)

nilpotent brs-transformations read as

having a trivial topology.

the metric plays in (2.5) the role of a gauge parameter [1] which we also let transform as a
brs-doublet as given in the last line of (2.6). furthermore, to control the n-dependence
of the theory we use the arguments of [6] and enlarge the brs-transformations by allowing
also a variation of the local vector n:

and add the following term to the action

sn =  ,

s = 0 ,

sn = z d4xg(cid:16)cagaa

is nilpotent on-shell4:

s2ba

 = f abc (sinv + sgf + sn)

and

s2 = 0

for all other elds.

(2.9)

one can easily verify the brs-invariance of the gauge xed action, which obeys

s(sinv + sgf + sn) = 0 .

we present the canonical dimensions and the faddeevpopov charges of all elds in table

3 superdieomorphisms

as already shown in [1] for the landau-type gauge, the four dimensional antisymmetric
tensor eld model possesses besides the brs-symmetry and the invariance under dieo-
morphisms a further invariance of supersymmetric-kind, namely the so-called superdieo-
morphisms. for these local transformations we propose:

4it should be mentioned that contrary to [1] our analysis using the generalized axial gauge gets simpler

due to the fact that we have less elds.

(3.11)

where l represents the lie derivative and  is the vector parameter of the transforma-
tions carrying ghost number +2. the resulting algebra between the brs-operator and
the superdieomorphisms closes on-shell:

{s, ()} = l + equations of motion ,

{(), ()} = 0 .

(3.12)

at this stage one remarks that contrary to the case of [1] there is no constraint which
requires the manifold to possess killing vectors. therefore, the underlying paper is a
generalization of [1].

4 the oshell analysis

in order to describe the brs-symmetry content consistently at the functional level, we in-
troduce a set of external sources5 coupled to the nonlinear brs-variations of the quantum
elds:

sext = z d4x ha(sba

) + a(saa
2 z d4x f abcabc

+

)i +

(4.13)

we display the canonical dimensions and the faddeevpopov charges of the external
sources in table 2.

5one has to note that the sources have weight +1.

5 proof of the niteness

this section is devoted to discuss the full symmetry content of the theory at the quantum
level, i.e. the question of possible anomalies and the stability problem which amounts to
analyze all invariant counterterms.

we begin by studying the stability where in the rst step we consider one-loop corrections.
this requires the analysis of the most general counterterms for the total action and implies
to consider the following perturbed action

 =  + h ,

(5.29)

where  is the total action (4.14) and  is an arbitrary functional depending via  on
the same elds as  and satisfying the slavnov identity (4.15), the ward identity for the
superdieomorphisms (4.17), the gauge conditions (4.24), the antighost equations (4.25),
the ghost equation (4.26) and the ward identity for the dieomorphisms (4.20). the
perturbation  collecting all appropriate invariant counterterms is an integrated local
eld polynomial of dimension four and ghost number zero.

now we are searching for the most general deformation of the classical action such that
the perturbed action  still fullls the above constraints. therefore the perturbation 
has to obey the following set of equations:


ba = 0 ,

= 0 ,
ha


a = 0 ,

a = 0 ,



ca + ggn

a = 0 .

(5.34)

(5.35)

(5.36)
(5.37)

(5.38)

(5.39)

the rst three equations (5.30)(5.32) imply that the perturbation  does not depend
on the multiplier elds ba, ha
 and a, whereas the equations (5.33)(5.35) imply that the
dependence of (a, ca), (a, a

) and (a, a) is given by the following combinations

a = a  ggnca
a = a  ggg(n a
a = a + ggn

(5.40)

the equations (5.36)(5.38), as in reference [1], can be unied into a single operator :

() + w d

producing a cohomology problem

it can be easily veried that the operator  is nilpotent

2 = 0 .

)
[, ]  (cid:19) 

(5.41)

(5.42)

(5.43)

therefore, any expression of the form   is automatically a solution of (5.42). a solution
of this type is called a trivial solution. hence, the most general solution of (5.42) reads

 = c +   .

(5.44)

here, the nontrivial solution c is -closed (c = 0), but not trivial (c 6=  ).
we begin with the determination of the nontrivial solution of (5.42). for this purpose we
introduce a ltering operator n :

n = z d4x x






,

(5.45)

where  stands for all elds, including n, ,  and . to all elds we assign the
homogeneity degree 1. the ltering operator induces a decomposition of  according to

 = 0 + 1

.

8

(5.46)

the operator 0 does not increase the homogeneity degree while acting on a eld polyno-
mial. on the other hand, the operator 1 increases the homogeneity degree by one unit.
furthermore, the nilpotency of  leads to

{0, 1} = 0 ,
hence, we obtain from (5.47) the following relation

2
0 = 0 ,

2
1 = 0 .

0 = 0 ,

(5.47)

(5.48)

which yields a further cohomology problem. the usefulness of the decomposition (5.46)
relies on a very general theorem [3] stating that the cohomology of the complete operator
 is isomorphic to a subspace of the cohomology of the operator 0. the cohomology of 0
is easier to solve than the cohomology of . the operator 0 acts on the elds as follows:

2  ba

 ,

 = ca ,

0aa
0ca = 0 ,
0a = 0 ,
0 a = 1
0la =  a
0g = g
,
0n =  ,
0 =  ,

,

 +  a

 = a ,
0a
0 a =  a
0a = aa

0da =  a
0g = 0 ,
0 = 0 ,
0 = 0 ,

.

,

we notice that the quantities g , g, n, ,  and  transform under 0 as doublets,
being therefore out of the cohomology [3, 7]. the nontrivial solution c can now be
written as integrated local eld polynomial of form degree four and ghost number zero:

c = z 0

4

,

(5.50)

where p
q is a eld polynomial of form degree q and ghost number p. using the stokes
theorem, the algebraic poincare lemma [7] and the relation {0, d} = 0, where d repre-
sents the nilpotent exterior derivative (d2 = 0), we obtain the following tower of descent
equations:

00
01
02
03

4 + d1
3 + d2
2 + d3
1 + d4
04

3 = 0 ,
2 = 0 ,
1 = 0 ,
0 = 0 ,
0 = 0 .

(5.51)

the tower of descent equations (5.51) has been solved in [1], where it was shown that 4
0
takes the following form:

4
0 = uaa + vf abccacbc

,

(5.52)

9

with u and v being some constant coecients. in [1], the authors showed by using the
equation (5.39) that both u and v vanish.

next, we move to the computation of the trivial counterterms which are constrained by
the dimension, the ghost number and the weight requirements. the most general trivial
solution can be constructed as follows

(5.53)

the trivial counterterm6 may depend on the quantities  and  which do not appear in
the total action (4.14). for this reason we demand the expression   to be independent of
the parameters  and . in fact, after a tedious computation  reduces to an expression
which is forbidden by (5.39). thus, all of the coecients i, i = 1, . . . , 50 vanish.
therefore, we have shown that the total action  does not admit any deformations at the

6in (5.53) the quantities i, i = 1, . . . , 50 are constant coecients to be determined.

quantum level.

the last step in our analysis is devoted to the discussion of the existence of possible
breaking of the symmetries at the quantum level. by using the same arguments as in [1]
and under the assumption that the quantum action principle is also valid in the case of
non-covariant gauges [4], one can easily show that the symmetries of the model do not
admit any anomalies and therefore, are valid at the quantum level. this completes the
proof of niteness of the four dimensional antisymmetric tensor eld model to all orders of
perturbation theory, quantized on a topologically trivial and asymptotically at manifold.
