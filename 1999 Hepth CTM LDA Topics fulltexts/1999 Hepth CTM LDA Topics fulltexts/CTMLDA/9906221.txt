(for sake simplicity, concentrated full bosonic sector theories; fermionic sector addressed elsewhere.) metric ansatz describes warped product six- dimensional spacetime 4-sphere. warp factor depends latitude coordinate 4-sphere, viewed foliation 3-spheres. since vanishes equator, geometry internal space really upper hemisphere 4-sphere, equator boundary. (this region type string theory becomes strongly coupled, dual weakly coupled heterotic string theory side gauge enhancement takes place.) presented examples six-dimensional solutions re- interpreted solutions massive iia theory. generally, construction opens door higher-dimensional re-interpretation solution six-dimensional theory, including, example, non-abelian congurations. acknowlegement grateful t.a. tran useful discussions.
