abstract

in this paper we construct the 5 parameter generating solution of n = 8 bps regular
supergravity black holes as a ve parameter solution of the n = 2 st u model. our
solution has a simpler form with respect to previous constructions already appeared in the
literature and moreover, through the embedding [sl(2)]3  su (3, 3)  e7(7) discussed
in previous papers, the action of the u duality group is well dened. this allows to
reproduce via u duality rotations any other solution, like those corresponding to rr
black holes whose microscopic description is given by intersecting dbranes.

introduction

after the advent of d-branes [1] there has been a renewed interest in the study of supergravity
black p-branes, in particular those preserving a fraction of the original supersymmetry. this
is due to their identication with the bps saturated nonperturbative states of superstring
theory [2, 3] which has promoted them from classical solutions of the lowenergy theory to
solutions of the whole quantum theory. therefore they represent an important tool in probing
the nonperturbative regime of superstring theories. of particular interest are the regular ones,
namely those having a nonvanishing bekensteinhawking entropy.

in this paper we deal with bps static black hole solutions of d = 4 supergravity preserving
1/8 of the original n = 8 supersymmetry, completing a program started in [4] and continued
in [5]. let us recall that in the context of toroidally compactied type ii supergravity the
only regular black hole solutions are the 1/8 supersymmetry preserving ones. the 1/2 and
1/4 black holes, whose general form has been completely classied in [6], have a vanishing
horizon area. more precisely, the only 4dimensional regular black hole congurations are
those preserving 4 supersymmetry charges, irrespectively of their higher dimensional origin.
one of the results of [4] was to show that the most general 1/8 black hole solution of n = 8
supergravity can be related, through a uduality transformation,to a solution of a suitable
consistent truncation n = 8  n = 2 of the supergravity theory (corresponding to a calabi-
yau compactication). uduality in supergravity denotes the largest global symmetry of the
eld equations and bianchi identities. we shall recall the main facts about uduality orbits
of bps black holes in section 2 and it will be shown that the problem of studying the most
general 1/8 bps black hole in the n = 8 theory can be reduced to that of nding the so called
generating solution, that is the most general one modulo uduality transformations, which is
a solution of the simpler n = 2 truncation. once this solution is found, acting on it with
the maximal compact subgroup h = su(8) of the uduality group one generates the general
charged black hole and then acting with the whole uduality group u = e7(7) one generates
the most general solution, namely that with fully general asymptotic values of the scalar elds.
in order to dene the action of the n = 8 uduality group on a solution of the aforementioned
n = 2 truncation, the embedding of the latter in the n = 8 theory has to be dened in a precise
group theoretical fashion. this was done in [4] and [5] using the solvable lie algebra formalism
[7]. the n = 2 truncation mentioned above is called the st u model (rst studied in [8]) and
essentially is a n = 2 supergravity coupled to 3 vector multiplets interacting through the
special kahler manifold [sl(2, ir)/so(2)]3. it has therefore 6 real scalars (3 dilatonlike and
3 axionlike) and four vector elds. a generic static, spherically symmetric black hole solution
of this model is then characterized by 4 electric (q) and 4 magnetic (p) quantized charges

1

and a point  in the scalar manifold representing the asymptotic behavior of the scalar elds
at innite radial distance from the center of the solution. the generating solution is obtained
by xing the [sl(2, ir)]3 duality action on a generic bps black hole solution, which is achieved
by rst choosing a particular point  of the scalar manifold and then xing the action of the
isotropy group [so(2)]3 on the solution, which amounts to imposing three suitable conditions
on the quantized charges. these conditions in turn allow for three conditions on the evolving
scalar elds of the solution, compatible with the eld equations and the bps requirement. the
generating solution therefore will be described by 5 charges and three independent scalars. the
mathematical framework in which to construct such a solution has been dened in [5], however
an explicit solution was given only in a simplied case where the 3 dilatons bi and the 3 axions
ai were separately set equal to a single dilaton eld b and a single axion eld a. this solution,
if properly gaugexed, would depend only on 2 parameters. the aim of the present paper is
to relax these restrictions and compute the 5parameter generating solution within the st u
model. other regular solutions of the same theory, dierent from the generating one, have been
considered in other papers [9].

as pointed out in [4] and [10], the generating solution represents a pure nsns black hole,
that is a black hole whose 10 dimensional microscopic conguration is made only of ns branes.
indeed, the generating solution for black holes of the toroidally compactied type ii string
theory is the same as the one of the toroidally compactied heterotic string and it was already
constructed in [11]. our point is that, as noticed in [12], as far as the microscopic entropy
counting is concerned it is dicult to count the states of a pure nsns conguration. therefore
it is essential to be able to reproduce rr congurations which are those represented in terms
of intersecting dbranes only. this in principle would not be a problem since uduality does
not make any dierence between rr and nsns elds and one should be able to move from
a solution to any other acting via uduality transformations. however, as previously pointed
out, in order for this to be possible one has not only to build up the generating solution itself
but also to know how the latter is embedded in the full theory.

the paper is organized as follows:
in section 2 we describe the structure of the uduality orbits for 1/8 bps black holes in terms
of 5 independent invariants and characterize the generating solution as a solution depending
on 5 independent charge parameters, in terms of which the 5 invariants can be expressed as
independent functions on the chosen point of the moduli space at innity.

in section 3 we explicitly construct the 5 parameters generating solution by solving both the
rst and second order dierential equations, after performing the aforementioned 3 parameter
gauge xing. the need to check that a particular solution of the rst order equations repre-

2

senting the bps condition fulll the second order eld equations as well is due to a known
feature of solitonic solutions in supergravity that the former equations in general dont imply
the latter.

most of the technical aspects concerning both the derivation of the rst and second order
dierential equations (the former representing the bps conditions, the latter being the equa-
tions of motion) and the proper formalism needed in order to embed the st u model solution
in the n = 8 theory properly, have already been given in [4] and [5]. hence we shall skip most
technical details and make use of the results already obtained in [5].

we end in section 4 with few comments and some concluding remarks.

2 u duality orbits and the generating solution

let us recall the main facts about the uduality orbits of 1/8 bps black holes in the n = 8
classical supergravity theory [13],[14]. it is well known that the equations of motion and the
bianchi identities of the n = 8 classical supergravity theory in 4dimensions are invariant
with respect to the uduality group e7(7). this invariance requires the group e7(7) to act
simultaneously on both the 70 scalar elds  spanning the manifold mscal = e7(7)/su(8) and
on the vector ~q consisting of the 28 electric and 28 magnetic quantized charges. the uduality
group acts on the scalar elds as the isometry group of mscal and on ~q in the 56 (simplectic)
representation. a static, spherically symmetric bps black hole solution is characterized in
general by the vector ~q and a particular point  on the moduli space of the theory whose 70
coordinates 
 are the values of the scalar elds at innity (r  ). acting on a black hole
solution ( , ~q) by means of a uduality transformation g one generates a new black hole
solution (g

 , ~qg):

g  g (   g

(0)

~q  ~qg = s(g)  ~q

where

s(g)  sp(56, ir)

(2.1)

the bps black hole solutions ll therefore uduality orbits.

as far as the 1/8 bps black holes are concerned these orbits turn out to be parameterized
by 5 functions i(, ~q)i (i = 1, . . . , 5) which are invariant under the duality transformations
in (2.1). these invariants are expressed in terms of the 8  8 antisymmetric central charge
matrix zab(, ~q) (the antisymmetric couple (ab), as a and b run from 1 to 8, labels the
representation 28 of su(8)) in the following way ([10]):

ik = tr(cid:16)zz(cid:17)k

where zz denotes the matrix z aczcb and the convention z ab = (zab) is adopted. among
the i(, ~q)i a particular role is played by the moduliindependent invariant i5( ~q) that is the
quartic invariant (which will be denoted in the sequel also by p(4)( ~q) in order to refer to its
group theoretical meaning ) of e7(7) whose value is related to the entropy of the black hole
[15],[16]. as pointed out in [17], p(4) must be nonnegative in order for the solution to be
bps (p(4)  0). for a xed value of i5( ~q) the inequivalent orbits are parameterized by the
remaining four invariants i(, ~q)k, (k = 1, . . . , 4). the behavior of the scalars describing the
regular solutions with xed entropy is schematically represented in figure 1 in which the scalar
elds ow from their boundary values  at innity which span mscal (the disk) to their xed
values f ix at the horizon r = 0 [15]. it should be understood, of course, that the  axis is a
ndimensional space, where n is the dimension of mscal. the invariants i(, ~q)i turn out to
be independent functions of the quantized charges in any generic point  of the modulispace
except for some singular points where the number of truly independent invariants could be
less than ve. this is the case, for example, of the point  = f ix parameterized by the xed
values of the scalar elds at the horizon. in this point the only independent invariant is the
moduliindependent one, i5. we will come back on this at the end of this section.

the generating solution may be characterized as the solution depending on the the minimal
number of parameters sucient to obtain all possible 5plets of values for the 5 invariants on
a particular point  6= f ix of the modulispace (a possible vacuum of the theory). from the
above characterization it follows that the whole uduality orbits of 1/8 bps black hole solutions
may be constructed by acting by means of e7(7) transformations (2.1) on the generating one.
in particular, if we focus on 1/8 bps black hole solutions having a xed value of the entropy
(proportional to the square root of i( ~q)5) and on a particular bosonic vacuum for the theory

figure 2: the scalar modulispace mscal and the action of the u duality group on a generic point . the tower on each
point of mscal represents the 1/8 bps black hole spectrum of the theory realized on that bosonic background. in a generic point
 it describes a snapshot of the u duality orbit of this particular kind of solutions. acting on the charges only, one generates
all black holes having the same values of the asymptotic elds and moves in the tower at a given . acting on both the charges
and the moduli one moves in mscal but the solution does not change its adm mass (this being a u duality invariant quantity).
since the u duality orbit is characterized by 5 invariants ii , in a point  in which ii are independent functions of the charges ~q
the generating solution may be characterized as a minimal set of solutions in the corresponding tower on which the ve invariants
assume all possible values (compatible with the bps condition). therefore the generating solution should depend only on ve
charge parameters and, by acting just on the latter by means of the u duality group (vertical action in the gure), one is able
to reconstruct all the sates of the tower.

specied by a point  in the modulispace, by acting only on the charges of the generating
solution with the uduality group, it would be possible to construct the whole spectrum of
1/8 bps solutions of the theory realized in the chosen vacuum  (see figure 2). since in
a particular point  6= f ix on mscal the minimum number of parameters a solution should
depend on in order to reproduce all the 5plets of values for the independent invariants is
obviously ve, we expect the charge vector ~q of the generating solution (, ~q) to depend on
ve independent charges.

in order to motivate, in brief, the result obtained in [4] according to which the generating
solution for 1/8 bps black holes in the n = 8 theory is described within a suitable n = 2
truncation of the theory (the st u model), let us notice that the 5 quantities in eq. (2.2) are
invariant with respect to the action of su(8) on zab. in particular, by means of a 48parameter
su(8) transformation, the central charge matrix can be brought to its normal form in which it
is skewsymmetrized with complex eigenvalues (zk), k = 1, . . . , 4 (|z4| > |z3|  |z2|  |z1|).
as a consequence of this rotation (see [4] and [5] for a detailed discussion) the central charge
eigenvalues end up depending on just 6 (dynamical) scalar elds and 8 quantized charges which

5

characterize the solutions of an st u model suitably embedded in the original theory. within
this truncation, the 6 scalar elds (3 dilatons bi and 3 axions ai) belong to 3 vector multiplets
and span a manifold mst u = [sl(2, ir)/so(2)]3, while the 4 electric charges q and 4 magnetic
charges p ( = 0, . . . , 3) transform in the (2, 2, 2) of [sl(2, ir)]3. in the framework of the st u
model, the central charge eigenvalues z4(ai, bi, ~q) and zi(ai, bi, ~q) (i = 1, 2, 3) are, respectively,
the local realization on moduli space mst u of the n = 2 supersymmetry algebra central
charge z and of the 3 matter central charges associated with the 3 matter vector elds (which
are related to the central charge via the following relation: z i(z, z, p, q) = hijjz(z, z, p, q),
hij being the kahler metric on mst u and zi = ai + ibi). on the 1/8 bps black hole solutions
these four eigenvalues are in general independent in a generic point of the modulispace and
the bps condition reads:

madm = lim

r|z4(ai, bi, ~q)|

(2.3)

since the su(8) transformation used to dene the st u truncation of the original theory did not
aect the values of the 5 invariants in eq. (2.2), the latter are expected to assume all possible
5plets of values on bps solutions of this theory. from this we conclude that the generating
solution for 1/8 bps black holes in the n = 8 theory is a solution of the st u truncation as
well.

in the framework of the st u model the ve invariants in eq. (2.2) are rewritten in the

following form:

i(, ~q)k =

i( ~q)5 =

4xk=1|zk|2k
4xk=1|zk|4  2

4xk1>k2=1|zk1|2|zk2|2 + 4 (z 

1 z 

2 z 

3 z 

4 + z1z2z3z4)

(2.4)

however in this model there is still a residual invariance of the above quantities represented by
the 3 parameter group [so(2)]3, isotropy group of the scalar manifold mst u and subgroup of
su(8). it acts on the four phases k of the central charge eigenvalues zk leaving the overall
phase  = pk k invariant. the generating solution is obtained by xing this gauge freedom
and therefore it depends, consistently with what stated above, on 5 parameters represented by
the four norms of the central charge eigenvalues |zk| plus the overall phase . these quantities
are uduality invariants as well. it can be shown indeed that the norms |zk| may be expressed
in terms of the four invariants ik (k = 1, 2, 3, 4) while the overall phase is contained in the
expression of the pfaan in i5 and thus is an invariant quantity as well which is expressed in
terms of all the ve ii. indeed, see eq.s (2.2) and (2.4):

the moduli independent invariant i5, computed in the st u model, is the quartic invariant
of the (2, 2, 2) of [sl(2, ir)]3 and it is useful to express it in a form which is intrinsic to this
representation. we may indeed represent the vector ~q = (p, q) as a tensor q123 where
i = 1, 2 are the indices of the 2 of each sl(2, ir) factor. the invariants are constructed by
contracting the indices of an even number 2m of q123 with 3m invariant matrices ii. this
contraction gives zero for m odd while for m even one nds:

p(2)(p, q) = q123q123112233 = 0
p(4)(p, q) = q123q123q123q123112211223333 =
4(p3q0 + q1q2)(p1p2  p0q3)  (p0q0 + p1q1 + p2q2  p3q3)2

p(8)(p, q) = c  (p4(p, q))2
p(12)(p, q) = c  (p4(p, q))3

. . .

(2.6)

it can be shown rigorously that the quartic invariant written above is the only independent
invariant of this representation, that is any other invariant may be expressed as powers of it.
the square root of p(4) is proportional to the entropy of the solution and its expression is
consistent with the result of [8]. in terms of the 8 quantized charges the components of q123
are:

q1,1,1 = p0 ; q2,1,1 = p1 ; q1,2,1 = p2 ; q1,1,2 = p3 ;
q2,2,2 = q0 ; q1,2,2 = q1 ; q2,1,2 = q2 ; q2,2,1 = q3

(2.7)

according to the above characterization of the generating solution, it is apparent therefore
that the black hole found in [5] represents just a particular (regular) solution characterized by
just 2 invariant parameters (|z1| = |z2| = |z3| and |z4|), although depending on three charges.
that solution was obtained by setting s = t = u and p1 = p2 = p3 = p, q1 = q2 = q3 = q,
p0 = 0. therefore, acting on it by means of an uduality transformation, it is clear from
our previous discussion that it would be possible to span only a 2parameter suborbit of
the whole uduality orbit. the same argument holds for all the regular 1/8 bps black holes
characterized by less than 5 independent invariant parameters, in particular for the double xed
solution found in [8]. this is infact a very particular solution in which the values of the scalars
at innity coincide with their xed values at the horizon  = f ix. at this point the matter
central charges vanish (zi(f ix, ~q) = 0, i = 1, 2, 3) and the central charge z4(f ix, ~q) becomes
proportional to i( ~q)1/4
5 which represents therefore the only invariant parameter characterizing
the spectrum of 1/8 bps solutions on this particular point of the modulispace. the 5plet

7

of invariants (i1,i2,i3,i4,i5) on this solution have the specic simple form (a, a2, a3, a4, a2), a
being a constant depending on the 8 charges and proportional to the entropy.

summarizing, the three main facts reviewed in the present section are:

 the uduality orbits of 1/8 bps black hole solutions are characterized by ve uduality

invariants ii.

 the generating solution (, ~q) is characterized by a generic point on the moduli space
at innity  6= f ix (in which the ve invariants are actually independent functions
of the charges ~q) and by ve independent charge parameters ~q such that, by varying
the latter one obtains all possible combinations of values of ii consistent with the bps
condition (i5  0).

 the generating solution of 1/8 susy preserving black holes of n = 8 supergravity can
be thought of as a 1/2 preserving solution of an st u model suitably embedded in the
original theory [5]. in this framework, which is that we will deal with, the ve invariants
ii can be expressed as proper combinations of the norms of the four central charges |zk|
(the supersymmetry and the three matter ones corresponding to k = 4 and k = 1, 2, 3
respectively) and their overall phase , according to eqs. (2.4) and (2.5).

3 the 5 parameter generating solution

in the present section we shall compute the 5parameter generating solution as a 1/2 bps
black hole solution of the st u model.

the property a bps saturated state have of preserving a fraction of the original supersym-
metries can be characterized, on a bosonic background, by requiring that the supersymmetry
transformations of all the fermion elds vanish along a suitable direction in the supersymmetry
parameter space (killing spinor):

fermions = 0

0 a = i ab b if a, b = 1, 2

(3.1)

the rst of these equations is equivalent to a system of rst order dierential equations on the
background elds. in particular the system of equations in the scalar elds has a xed point,
which will be denoted by f ix = (bf ix
), towards which the solution (r) = (bi(r), ai(r))
ows to at the horizon r  0 [15].

the way eq. (3.1) has been written expresses the reality condition for z4(, p, q) and it
amounts to x one of the three so(2) gauge symmetries of h already giving therefore a

i

, af ix

i

8

condition on the 8 charges and the scalar elds. in general however, as pointed out in [18], one
should in fact consider a more general form for the killing spinor condition 1, namely:

0 a = i

ab b

z4
|z4|

(3.2)

and, as noticed by g. moore, imposing the reality of the central charge could in principle imply
that some topologically nontrivial solutions are disregarded. nevertheless studying such a
special class of solutions is not among the purposes of our present investigation and therefore
we shall choose the supersymmetry central charge to be real (im(z4) = 0).

let us consider the gauge xing procedure in detail. the four central charges zk(, ~q) of
i ) and 8

the st u model, depending on the asymptotic values of the six scalars  = (a
charges ~q = (p, q), transform under [sl(2, ir)]3 duality (2.1) as follows:

i , b

g  [sl(2, ir)]3
hg  so(2)3

zk(g, ~qg) = hg  zk(, ~q)
hg  zk  eig

k zk

(3.3)

hence an [sl(2, ir)]3 duality transformation on the moduli at innity and on the quantized
charges amounts to an [so(2)]3 phase transformation on the four central charges. this holds
true in particular if we consider g  [so(2)]3. it follows that the [so(2)]3 gauge xing may
be achieved by either imposing three suitable conditions on the phases of the central charges,
or alternatively xing the [so(2)]3 action on ~q on a chosen point 0
 of the moduli space at
innity. we shall pursue the latter way which amounts to impose three suitable conditions on
the quantized charges. these conditions will not be derived with group theoretical arguments,
it will suce, as it has been pointed out in the last section, to show that the ve invariants,
computed in , are independent functions of the remaining ve charges.

since, on one hand, the twofold action of a duality transformation (and in particular of a
[so(2)]3 transformation) on both the quantized charges and the scalar elds is an invariance of
the equations of motion, and on the other hand the charges ~q are constants of motion (with
respect to the revolution), we expect that the three gauge xing conditions on the electric and
magnetic charges have a counterpart in three rindependent conditions on the elds (r), such
that the restricted system of scalar elds and vector elds is still a solution of the eld equations.
after the gauge xing procedure therefore we would expect the solution to be described by ve
independent charges, three real scalar elds and the metric function u(r). the evolution of the
latter four elds will be described in terms of four dierent harmonic functions.

let us now recall the main positions on the background elds used to derive the rst order

equations from equation (3.1).

1this result was eventually used in [26] and [28].

the vector (l(z, z), m(z, z)) is the covariantly holomorphic section on the simplectic bundle
dened on the special kahler manifold mst u .

as already stressed, in order to nd a proper solution we need also the equations of motion
that must be satised together with the rst order ones. the former can be derived from an
n = 2 pure supergravity action coupled to 3 vector multiplets (see [19] for notation):

s = z d4xg l
where
l = r[g] + hij(z, z)zizj

+(cid:16)imnf 

 f | + renf 

 ef |(cid:17)

(3.10)

it was shown in [5] that the maxwell equations are automatically satised by the ansatze (3.5).
what really matters then are the scalar and einstein equations which should be fullled by our
ansatze. their explicit form have been computed in [5] and we report them in the appendix.

3.1 gauge xing conditions and invariants

the generating solution we are going to dene is characterized by the following conditions on
the quantized charges and on the scalar elds:
on the charges:

p0 = 0

,

p1
p3 =

p3
p2   , q1 +

q2


+ q3 = 0

11

and

 6= 0

on the elds:

b1 = b , b2 =

b


, b3  b

a1


+ a2 + a3 = 0

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

the relation (3.13) on the axions derives from the reality condition on the supersymmetry
central charge z4:

imz4 = 0

(3.14)

once the conditions (3.11) on the charges and the two conditions on the scalars in eqs (3.12)
are taken into account.

one may check that the positions (3.11),(3.12) and (3.13) are indeed consistent with the
eld equations and with the system of rst order equations (a.1). in particular they are fullled
by the xed point values of the scalar elds (af ix

, bf ix

):

(3.15)

where p(4)(p, q) was dened in eqs. (2.6).

a solution consistent with (3.11),(3.12) and (3.13) will be described by four independent
elds, say a1, a2, b,u and ve independent parameters, say , p3, q0, q1, q3. as previously pointed
out, in order for our solution to be bps it is necessary that p(4)(p, q)  0 which provides an
inequality condition on the ve parameters , p3, q0, q1, q3.

to check that conditions (3.11),(3.12) and (3.13) actually x the [so(2)]3 gauge, let us
compute the ve invariants |zk|, tg() in a suitable point of the moduli space at innity 
which will characterize the asymptotic behavior of our generating solution. for simplicity we
shall choose:

 = (a

i = 0 ; b

2 = 1/ , b
1 =  , b
12

3 = b = 1)

(3.16)

it is useful to express the invariants in terms of the following quantities:

x = re(z1) = s
y = re(z2) = s
w = im(z3) = s
v = re(z4) = s

(3.17)

where p (ijk) denotes the three cyclic permutations of the indices (ijk). it is straightforward
to show that the ve invariants have the following expressions in terms of the above quantities:

|z1|2 = 2w2 + x2
w2
2 + y2
|z2|2 =
|z3|2 = w2 +(cid:18)y +
|z4|2 = v2
tg() =

x

(cid:19)2

w(x2 + 4y2 + 2(w2 + xy))

xy(x + 2y)

(3.18)

where we have used the property that re(z1), re(z2) and re(z3) have to fulll the same
linear relation (3.13) as the axions ai. an important feature of the system (3.18) is to have a
real solution in terms of x, y, w, v,  for any 5plet of values of the invariants. particular care,
however, has to be taken when dealing with the case in which one or more of the matter central
charges vanish. the corresponding solution of the system (3.18) is obtained by dening suitable
limits of the quantities x, y, w, v,  in which it can be shown that the generating solution is still
regular. the case for which |zi| = 0, i = 1, 2, 3 is easily solved by setting x = y = w  0, and
corresponds to the doublexed solution.

now let us compute the invariants in (3.18) on our solution, which is characterized by
the above dened point  in the moduli space and by the ve independent parameters
, p3, q0, q1, q3 left over after applying the conditions (3.11) on the 8 quantized charges. to
show that the ve invariants in  are actually independent functions of , p3, q0, q1, q3, we
simply need to show that the quantities x, y, w, v,  are. specializing equations (3.17) to the
point  in (3.16) one obtains:

x = 22q1

13

(q1 + q3)

2
y = 

2(cid:16)q0  p3(cid:17)
1
w =
v = w + 22p3

(3.19)

the above system has clearly a solution in terms of , p3, q0, q1, q3 for any combinations of real
values for , x, y, w, v.

therefore we have shown that by varying the ve parameters , p3, q0, q1, q3, one may cover
the whole spectrum of values for the ve invariants in (3.18) (or equivalently ii, i = 1, . . . , 5
dened in section 2) describing all possible uduality inequivalent solutions.

3.2 the solution

implementing the conditions (3.11),(3.12) and (3.13), the system of rst order equations (a.1)
simplies dramatically and reduces to the following form:

=   eu
r2! 1
2b(cid:16)f (ai)  b2p3(cid:17)
db
dr
r2!b2p3(cid:16)a1  af ix

du
dr
f (ai) = xi
qiai  xp (ijk)

piajak + q0

1

(3.20)

to solve the above equations it is useful to start dening the function h(r) = eub whose

equation is easily solved:

dh
dr

=

h2
r2

2p3 

h(r) = h(r)1
k
h(r) = a +
r
k = 2p3

in what follows we shall put a = 1.

the equations for the independent axions a1, a2 may then be rewritten as follows:

dai
dr

=  h(r)

r2 !2p3(cid:16)ai  af ix

i (cid:17) i = 1, 2

14

(3.21)

(3.22)

the solution of the above equations is :

ai(r) =

hi(r)
h(r)

hi(r) =  a

i +

ki

r! =

ki
r

ki = kaf ix

i

(3.23)

as far as the equation for b is concerned, substituting the expressions of ai(r) in f (ai) one
obtains an equation for b(r) which is easily solved by introducing a new harmonic function
h4(r). once b(r) is known, from the expression of h(r) it is straightforward to derive the
solution for u(r). the result for the independent evolving elds a1,2(r), b(r),u(r) is summarized
below in terms of the four dierent harmonic functions h(r), h1,2(r), h4(r):

ai(r) =

hi(r)
h(r)

b(r) = vuut h(r)h4(r) + mh1(r) + nh2(r)
eu (r) = (cid:16)h(r)2(h(r)h4(r) + mh1(r) + nh2(r))(cid:17)1/4
m = 

, n = 2af ix

h(r)2

q3
p3
k4
r

h4(r) = 1 +

, k4 = k b2

f ix

(3.24)

it can be shown that the above functional expressions for the elds ai(r), b(r) and u(r) fulll
the eld equations and therefore are a solution of the theory. eq.(3.24), together with eq.s
(3.11)-(3.13), represents our 5 parameter generating solution.

let us consider now the nearhorizon limit of the function eu (r):

lim
r0

eu (r) = r(cid:16)k3k4(cid:17)1/4

k3k4 = p(4)(p, q)

(3.25)

substituting this limit in the ansatze for the metric (3.8) we obtain the known result that the
near horizon geometry of a regular bps black hole is described by a bertottirobinson metric:

r2
m 2

ds2 =

dt2 
br = qp(4)(p, q)

br

m 2

br

m 2
r2 dr2  m 2

br(cid:16)sin2()d2 + d2(cid:17)

the entropy is proportional to the area of the horizon according to the bekensteinhawking
formula:

sbh = qp(4)(p, q)

(3.26)

where we have expressed  as the ratio p1/p3.

as a nal remark, we would like to comment on the dierence between the form of the
generating solution in (3.24) and the one described in statement 3.1 of [5], which was char-
acterized by two doublexed axions. the functional expression of the generating solution
obviously depends on the gauge xing procedure adopted and, for computational convenience,
in the present work we have xed the [so(2)]3 gauge using a prescription which is dierent
from that suggested in [5].

4 conclusions

in this paper we have constructed the generating solution for bps saturated static black holes of
n = 8 supergravity (that is either mtheory compactied on t 7, or equivalently type ii string
theory compactied on t 6). this solution preserves 4 supercharges and can be seen either as
1/8 preserving in the context of n = 8 theory or as 1/2 preserving in a type ii calabiyau
compactication (or eventually 1/4 supersymmetry preserving in heterotic on t 6 or type ii
on k 3  t 2). actually, among compactication of string theory down to four dimensions,
is the only regular one, modulo u-duality transformation, irrespectively of the original ten
dimensional theory.
in order for it to act as a generating solution one has to embed it in
the dierent uduality groups (e7(7) for toroidal type ii compactications and so(6, 22) for
heterotic ones).

our 5 parameter solution should be related via uduality transformations to that found
in [10]. while both these solutions carry only nsns charges, the proper group theoretical
embedding of our st u model generating solution in the n = 8 theory ([5]) allows one to obtain,
in principle, the macroscopic description of pure rr black holes which can be interpreted
microscopically in terms of dbranes only [20]. there has been an intense study in giving the
precise correspondence between macroscopic and microscopic black hole congurations in the
last couple of years. this has been investigated both in the context of n = 8 compactications
(see for example [20]-[22]) and of n = 2 compactications (see for example [23][27]). however,
all these solutions were somewhat particular under one circumstance or another. what we mean
is that a precise and general recipe to give this correspondence for any macroscopic conguration
is still lacking. on the contrary, if we know how to transform the generating solution into a
generic one, in particular to those whose microscopic interpretation is known, then we can derive
the microscopic stringy description of any geometric macroscopic solution. and this could shed
light even on some still not understood aspects of black hole physics as, for example, the very
conceptual basis of the microscopic entropy counting (for recent work in this direction see for
instance [29]). while most of the group theoretical machinery necessary in order to make the

16

embedding has been already constructed in [5], it is our aim, in a forthcoming paper, to give
some explicit examples of the use of uduality transformations in moving from a given solution
to other ones [30]. for example, one could nd the macroscopic description corresponding to
the ve parameter rr conguration of [12] which, to our knowledge, is the only pure rr
microscopic conguration depending on ve parameters present in the literature.
