abstract

finding solutions to non-linear eld theories, such as yang-mills theories

or general relativity, is usually dicult. the eld equations of yang-mills

theories and general relativity are known to share some mathematical simi-

larities, and this connection can be used to nd solutions to one theory using

known solutions of the other theory. for example, the schwarzschild solution

of general relativity can be shown to have a mathematically similar counter-

part in yang-mills theory. in this article we will discuss several solutions to

the yang-mills equations which can be found using this connection between

general relativity and yang-mills theory. some comments about the possi-

ble physical meaning of these solutions will be discussed.

in particular it

will be argued that some of these analog solutions of yang-mills theory may

have some connection with the connement phenomenon. to this end we will

briey look at the motion of test particles moving in the background potential

of the schwarzschild analog solution.

i. introduction

yang-mills theories [1] are non-abelian gauge theories which have found a central role in

particle physics in describing both the electroweak and strong interactions. the non-abelian

nature of yang-mills theories make the eld equations non-linear, and therefore much more

dicult to handle compared to abelian gauge theories such as pure electromagnetism. for

example, at the classical level (and also approximately at the quantum level if the quantum

corrections are not too large  see the introduction of ref. [2]) one can use superposition

for abelian gauge theories, while even at the classical level, superposition is not valid for

yang-mills theories. this non-linear nature of the yang-mills eld equations makes nding

solutions dicult. there are some well known and interesting solutions to the yang-mills

eld equations, such as the t hooft-polyakov monopole [3], the julia-zee dyon [4], the bps

dyon [5] [6], and the instanton [7], but there is no systematic way of arriving at solutions to

the yang-mills eld equations.

general relativity can also in some sense be considered a non-abelian gauge theory [8]

[9], and a mathematical connection between the two theories can be made [10] [11]. using

this connection between the two theories one can ask if the solutions to the eld equations

of one theory could provide a starting point to look for solutions in the other theory. this

is in fact possible, and one can nd a host of solutions in this manner. in this paper we will

give a review of the various solutions found in this way and discuss some of their properties.

all of the solutions discovered in this way have the apparent weak point that they have

an innite eld energy, i.e., there are singularities in the elds of the solutions which make

the eld energy innite. this is to be contrasted with the nite eld energy solutions of

refs. [3] [4] [5] [6]. however, aside from the mathematical interest in studying all types

of solutions that occur in such non-linear eld theories, we present some ideas concerning

the possible physical uses of such singular solutions. one speculation is that some of these

solutions may be connected with the connement phenomenon of the strong interaction.

just as the various black hole solutions (schwarzschild or kerr black holes) exhibit a type of

2

connement for any particle which crosses the event horizon, so too the yang-mills analogs

of these solutions may exhibit a conning behaviour.

the outline of the paper is as follows : first we will discuss the spherically symmetric

solutions of the su(2) yang-mills equations coupled to a scalar eld (these are usually called

the yang-mills-higgs equations). second we will discuss solutions for gauge groups other

than su(2). finally we will examine the behaviour of a test particle which is placed in the

potential of the schwarzschild analog solution. we will see that under certain conditions

this analog solution can conne the test particle, and that this system has a half-integer

angular momentum even though all the elds involved are of integer angular momentum.

ii. su(2) yang-mills field equations for spherically symmetric

field configurations

the system studied in this section is an su(2) gauge theory coupled to a scalar eld, a,

in the triplet representation. the scalar eld is taken to have no mass or self interaction.

the lagrangian for this system is

l =

where ga

 is the eld strength tensor of the su(2) gauge elds, which is dened in terms of

the gauge elds w a

 , as

ga

 = w a

  w a

 + gabcw b

w c


and d is the covariant derivative of the scalar eld which is given by

da = a + gabcw b

the general equations of motion for this system are

ga

 = gabc [gbw

da = gabc(db)w

these eld equations can be simplied through the use of a generalized wu-yang ansatz [12]

which was used by witten [13] to study multi-instanton solutions

(5)

k(r), g(r), j(r), and h(r) are the ansatz functions to be determined by the equations of

motion. inserting these expressions into the eld equations in eq. (4) we nd the following

set of coupled, non-linear equations,

r2k  = k(k 2 + g2 + h 2  j 2  1)

r2g = g(k 2 + g2 + h 2  j 2  1)

r2j  = 2j(k 2 + g2)

r2h  = 2h(k 2 + g2)

(6)

where the primes denote dierentiation with respect to r. the most well known solutions

to these equations are those discovered by prasad and sommereld [6] and independently

by bogomolnyi [5]. they are

k(r) = cos()cr csch(cr)

g(r) = sin()cr csch(cr)

j(r) = sinh()[1  cr coth(cr)]

h(r) = cosh()[1  cr coth(cr)]

(7)

where c,  and  are arbitrary constants. one of the nice properties of this solution is that

it has nite eld energy. in terms of the ansatz functions the energy density of the elds is

t 00 =

for the solution in eq. (7) this gives a non-singular energy density, which when integrated

over all space yields a nite eld energy of e = 4ccosh2()/g2. this nite energy property

4

of the bps solution is one of the main reasons for the interest in this classical solution. we

now examine the general relativistic analog solutions of the yang-mills equations.

a. solutions with spherical singularities

to nd the general relativistic analog solutions to the yang-mills eld equations we begin

by examining the schwarzschild solution of general relativity. the schwarzschild solution

in schwarzschild coordinates has two non-trivial components to the metric tensor : g00

and grr. the non-trivial spatial element has the form grr = kr

1kr and g00 = 1/grr where

k = 1/2gm. trying this form of grr in eq. (6) one immediately nds the following solution

k(r) =

j(r) =

 cos cr

1  cr
sinh 
1  cr

g(r) =

 sin cr

1  cr

h(r) =

cosh 
1  cr

(9)

where c,  and  are arbitrary constants. the solution with the minus sign in the denom-

inator (which we call the schwarzschild-like solution) develops a singularity in the gauge

elds (w a

 ) and scalar elds (a) on a spherical surface of radius r = r0 = 1/c. both the

schwarzschild-like solution and the solution with the plus sign in the denominator develop

singularities in the elds at r = 0. these eld singularities lead to the eld energy of these

solutions being innite, as can be seen by inserting the ansatz functions from eq. (9) into

eq. (8) and trying to integrate over all space. the investigation of such innite energy

solutions to the yang-mills equations has been discussed by several authors [14] [15] [16]

[17] [18] [19], and the earliest discussion actually pre-dates [14] the study of the nite energy

solutions such as the t hooft-polyakov monopole or the bps dyon.

although the innite eld energy of these solutions could be seen as a drawback as com-

pared to the nite energy solutions, there are other classical eld theory solutions which

nevertheless have a physical importance. the prime example is the coulomb solution in

electromagnetism which has a eld singularity at r = 0 that is similar to the r = 0 singular-

ities of the solutions in eq. (9). the schwarzschild-like solution, with its singular spherical

5

surface, has been speculated to have some connection with the connement phenomenon for

quarks [15] [17] [18] [20] [21]. by studying the motion of a test particle which moves in the

potentials given by the minus sign solution in eq. (9) one nds that the spherical singularity

in the elds represents a barrier which can trap the test particle inside the sphere. this is

similar in spirit to bag models of hadron structure where one looks at test particles moving

in some conning potential (such as an innite spherical well). also it is interesting that

this schwarzschild-like solution was arrived at from the general relativistic solution for a

non-rotating black hole, which exhibits its own type of connement : any particle which

passes within the event horizon becomes permanently trapped. one should be cautious

about pushing this analogy too far, since the nature of the spherical singularity in general

relativity and yang-mills theory are dierent. the singularity at the event horizon of the

general relativistic schwarzschild solution is not a physical singularity, but a coordinate sin-

gularity as can be seen by writing the schwarzschild solution in kruskal coordinates, where

the only singularity is the one at r = 0. both singularities in the yang-mills analog of the

schwarzschild solution are true singularities in the elds.

the existence of singular solutions for certain eld theories is not new (e.g. the singu-

larities in the coulomb solution of electromagnetism, the wu-yang monopole solution [12],

or the meron solutions [22]). even the appearance of a singularity in the gauge elds on a

spherical surface, such as occurs in the schwarzschild-like solution of eq. (9), which may at

rst appear unique, can be found in other innite energy solutions. these other solutions

possess an innite set of concentric spherical surfaces on which the elds develop a singu-

larity. this could be taken as evidence that such spherical surfaces with singularities are

not uncommon features in classical solutions to the yang-mills eld equations. the rst of

these solutions can be obtained by exchanging the hyperbolic functions of the bps solution

in eq. (7) with their trigonometric counterparts

k(r) = cos()cr csc(cr)

g(r) = sin()cr csc(cr)

j(r) = sinh()[1  cr cot(cr)]

h(r) = cosh()[1  cr cot(cr)]

(10)

this solution was briey discussed by hsu and mac [23] in their derivation of the bps

solution (i.e. hsu and mac start with a solution like that in eq.

(10) and apply the

transformation c  ic to arrive at the bps solution). this solution exhibits a series of

concentric spherical surfaces on which the gauge and scalar elds become singular. these

singularities are located on the spherical surfaces cr = n where n = 1, 2, 3, 4.... inserting

the ansatz functions of eq. (10) in eq. (8) we nd that the energy density of this solution

is

t 00 =

2cosh2()

r2g2


c 2csc2(cr)(cid:16)1  cr cot(cr)(cid:17)2


+ (cid:16)c 2r2csc2(cr)  1(cid:17)2

2r2

(11)




the energy density becomes singular on the same spherical surfaces as the gauge and scalar

elds. these spherical shells, on which the energy density becomes innite, cause the total

eld energy of this solution to diverge.

to obtain the next solution we simply try the complementary trigonometric functions

for the solution in eq. (10). doing this shows that the following is also a solution [24] to

the eq.(6)

k(r) = cos()cr sec(cr)

g(r) = sin()cr sec(cr)

j(r) = sinh()[1 + cr tan(cr)]

h(r) = cosh()[1 + cr tan(cr)]

(12)

it should be noted that due to the linear cr term in each solution, one can not obtain the

solution in eq. (12) from the other trigonometric solution in eq. (10) by simply letting

cr  cr  /2. although these two trigonometric solutions are in this sense distinct (i.e.

they are not simply related by the transformation cr  cr/2) they are physically similar

since most of the comments concerning the solution in eq. (10) apply here as well. most

obviously the ansatz functions, and therefore the gauge and scalar elds, become singular

when cr = n/2 where n = 1, 3, 5, 7, ... and at r = 0. thus this solution exhibits a series of

concentric spherical surfaces on which its elds become singular as well as a point singularity

at the origin. these singularities also show up in the energy density of this solution as they

did for the solution in eq. (10). the point singularity at r = 0 and the spherical singular

7

surfaces of the solutions in eqs. (10) (12) are similar to that of the solutions from eq. (9).

however, the solutions in eq. (9) only possessed one spherical surface on which the elds

and energy density diverged. one conjectured use for the schwarzschild-like solution is as a

possible explanation of the connement mechanism. when the schwarzschild-like solution

of ref. [19] is treated as a background potential in which a test particle is placed it is found

that the spherical singularity can act as an impenetrable barrier which traps the test particle

either in the interior or the exterior of the sphere [20], giving a classical type of connement.

similar results have been found for other singular solutions [15] [17] [18]. in addition ref.

[15] points out that such a classical type of connement is only possible with innite energy

solutions. treating the trigonometric solutions as a background potential would also trap

test particles between any two of the concentric spherical singularities. these trigonometric

solutions could possibly be used to solve the eld equations in some limited range of r, and

then it could be patched to one of the other solutions which would solve the eld equations

for the remaining range of r. this is similar to what is sometimes done in general relativity

where one tries to patch an exterior solution with some interior solution.

finally one can obtain a third solution to eq. (6) by applying the transformation c  ic

to the solution [24] in eq. (12). this yields

k(r) = icos()cr sech(cr)

g(r) = isin()cr sech(cr)

j(r) = sinh()[1  cr tanh(cr)]

h(r) = cosh()[1  cr tanh(cr)]

(13)

since the ansatz functions k(r) and g(r) are imaginary, the space components of the gauge

elds will be complex. despite this all the physical quantities associated with this complex

solution, such as energy density, are real. inserting the ansatz functions of eq. (13) into

eq. (8) we nd that the eld energy density is

t 00 =

2cosh2()

r2g2

"c 2sech2(cr)(cid:16)1  cr tanh(cr)(cid:17)2

+

(c 2r2sech2(cr) + 1)2

2r2

#

(14)

this energy density is real, but the total eld energy is innite due to the singularity at

r = 0. thus the above solution is more like a wu-yang monopole [12] or a charged point

particle, as opposed to a nite energy bps dyon.

8

b. su(2) solutions with increasing potentials

in addition to the preceding innite energy solutions which have gauge and scalar elds

that become singular on some spherical surface, there are other types of innite energy,

general relativistic analog solutions. in general relativity if one allows for a nonzero cosmo-

logical constant, , then the time-time component of the metric tensor for the schwarzschild

solution becomes [25]

g00 = 1 

2gm

r2

the newtonian potential for this solution is

 =

(g00  1)

2

=

r



r2
6

(15)

(16)

using eq. (16) as a starting point one nds the following simple solution [26] to eq. (6)

k(r) = cos g(r) = sin

j(r) = h(r) =

b
r

+ ar2

(17)

where a, b and  are arbitrary constants.

if one sets a = 0 then it can be seen the

schwarzschild-like solutions of eq. (9) and those above in eq. (17) are of a similar form in

the limit c   and e/c  2b. inserting the ansatz functions of eq. (17) into the gauge

and scalar elds of eq. (5) one nds that the time component of the gauge eld (w a

0 ) and

the scalar eld (a) behave like ar + b/r2. the space part of the gauge elds (w a

i ) have a

1/r dependence. this classical solution exhibits a linear conning potential similar to those

used in some phenomenological studies of hadronic spectra [27]. in addition lattice gauge

theory arguments [28] seem to indicate that the conning potential between quarks should

be linear. classical solutions similar to those in eq. (17) were also discussed in ref. [29] in

connection with the connement problem.

this solution also has an innite eld energy. inserting the ansatz functions of eq. (17)

into the energy density of eq. (8) and integrating to get the total eld energy one nds

where we have introduced an upper (rb) and lower (ra) cuto in the radial coordinate. if

one lets rb   then the eld energy becomes innite due to the linear part of the gauge

and scalar elds, while if one lets ra  0 then the eld energy becomes innite due to the

singularity at r = 0. compared to the solutions in eq. (9), which had innite eld energy

from local singularities (either at r = 0 or r = 1/c), the solution in eq. (17) can have a

innite eld energy from the point singularity at r = 0 and/or the linearly increasing gauge

and scalar elds as r  . again, although this classical solution has some undesirable

characteristics, it also exhibits features which are found in some phenomenological studies

of hadronic bound states.

c. su(3) solutions

up to this point we have discussed classical solutions to the yang-mills eld equations for

su(2) elds. since qcd involves the su(3) gauge group it is natural to ask if there are any

su(3) or even su(n) generalizations of the above solutions. one possibility is to embed the

above su(2) solutions into an su(n) gauge theory [30]. recently [31] a schwarzschild-like

classical solution was found which is not a simple embedding of the previous su(2) solutions

into an su(n) gauge theory, but is a true su(3) solution. to arrive at the su(3) solution

one makes the following generalization [31] of the wu-wu ansatz [32] [33] [34]

w0 =

i(r)

gr2

w a

i = (cid:16)a

ij  a

1
(cid:16)7x  5y + 2z(cid:17) +

ji(cid:17) xixj
a(cid:16)a
jk(cid:16)iljxk + ilkxj(cid:17) xl

gr3 w(r)

gr3 v(r)

(19)

where a are the gell-mann matrices. using this ansatz in the yang-mills eld equations

yields the following set of coupled dierential equations for the functions f (r), v(r), (r) and

w(r)

r2f  = f 3  f + 7f v2 + 2vw  f (w2 + 2)

r2v  = v3  v + 7vf 2 + 2f w  v(w2 + 2)

10

r2w = 6w(f 2 + v2)  12f v

r2 = 2(f 2 + v2)  4f vw

(20)

where the primes denote dierentiation with respect to r. the nonlinear, coupled dierential

equations in eq. (20) are the su(3) equivalents of the equations in eq. (6). in ref. [31]

several simplifying assumptions were made in order to make the problem more tractable.

first, taking w =  = 0, reduces eq. (20) to

r2f  = f (f 2  1 + 7v2)

r2v  = v(v2  1 + 7f 2)

(21)

then further simplifying by letting f 2 = v2 = q2/8 one nds that eq. (21) reduces to the

wu-yang [12] equation for q(r)

r2q  = q(q2  1)

(22)

this equation has been shown [14] [18] [31] to have a solution which is singular at some

radius r = r1. in other words near r = r1 the solution will be of the form

q(r) 

a

r1  r

(23)

where a and r1 are constant. thus, even with the scalar eld absent one can nd solutions

to the pure gauge eld theory equations which will tend to trap test particles behind a

spherical barrier in much the same way as the schwarzschild-like solution of eq. (9). it is

also possible to nd closed form solutions to a special case of the system in eq. (20) taking

v = w = 0 then the equations of eq. (20) become

r2f  = f (f 2  2  1)

r2 = 2f 2

which has the following simple closed form solution

f (r) = 

(r) = 

cr

1  cr

i

1  cr

11

(24)

(25)

other, similar solutions can be found by making dierent simplifying assumptions such as

f = w = 0. thus solutions with singular elds on a spherical surface are not unique to

su(2) gauge theories, but can also be found for su(3) [31] and in general for su(n) [30].

the interesting aspect of the solutions given by dzhunushaliev in ref. [31] is that these

solutions are true su(3) solutions rather than embeddings of the su(2) solution into the

su(n) gauge group as in ref. [30]. also the su(3) solutions presented here are pure gauge

eld solutions, as opposed to the general su(2) solutions for the system given in eq. (1),

which involves scalar elds. in some sense the role of the scalar eld of the su(2) system is

taken up by the time component of the gauge eld in the su(3) system. this can be seen by

comparing the system of equations of eq. (6) with the system of equations of eq. (20) : the

equations for f (r), v(r) are similar to those for k(r), g(r) while the equations for w(r), (r)

are similar to those for j(r), h(r).

iii. electromagnetic properties of the su(2) solutions

all of the su(2) solutions to the yang-mills eld equations have interesting electro-

magnetic features. to investigate these properties we will use t hoofts denition of a

generalized, gauge invariant, u(1) eld strength tensor [3]

f = ( aw a

 )  ( aw a

 ) 

1
g

abc a( b)( c)

(26)

where a = a(bb)1/2. this generalized u(1) eld strength tensor reduces to the usual

expression for the eld strength tensor if one performs a gauge transformation to the abelian

gauge where the scalar eld only points in one direction in isospin space (i.e. a = 3av)

[35]. if one associates this u(1) eld with the photon of electromagnetism then the solutions

in eqs. (9) (10) (12) (13) (17) carry magnetic and/or electric charges. in general the electric

and magnetic elds associated with these solutions are

ei = fi0 =

ri
gr

d

dr j(r)
r !

bi =

1
2

ijkfjk = 

ri
gr3

12

(27)

the magnetic eld of all the solutions is that of a point monopole of strength 4/g. the

reason for this will be discussed at the end of this section.

the electric eld of the schwarzschild-like solutions of eq. (9) is easily found by inserting

the ansatz function j(r) from eq. (9) into eq. (27). doing this gives

ei =

risinh(1  2cr)

gr3(1  cr)2

(28)

as r   this electric eld goes as 1/r3 which indicates that the net electric charge of this

solution is zero, although there appears to be some kind of dipole charge distribution.

the electric elds of both of the trigonometric solutions presented in eqs.

(10) (12)

are similar to each other in that they indicate that these solutions carry an innite electric

charge. taking the ansatz function j(r) from the trigonometric solution given in eq. (10)

and inserting it into eq. (27) yields the following electric eld

ei =

sinh()ri

gr3

(1  c 2r2csc2(cr))

(29)

the electric eld does not fall o for large r, but behaves like ricsc2(cr)/r. this electric eld

also becomes singular on the spherical surfaces dened by cr = n where n = 1, 2, 3, 4....

the trigonometric solution of eq. (12) exhibits the same type of electric eld except that it

becomes singular on the spherical shells given by cr = n/2 (with n = odd) and at r = 0.

the electric charge of this solution is also innite since the electric eld from eq. (29) does

not fall o as r  . for the special case where  = 0 , one nds that the solution carries

no electric charge, but only a magnetic charge. even in this case the energy density becomes

singular on the concentric spherical surfaces and at the origin. both the bps solution and

the solutions from eqs. (10) (12) have the same nite magnetic strength of 4/g. although

this solution is a dyon in the sense that it carries both magnetic and electric charge it is

probably not correct to view it as a particle-like solution, since the electric eld does not

fall o, thus implying that these solutions have an innite, spread out electric charge.

the electric eld associated with the complex solution in eq. (13) can be found in the

same way as for the other solutions. inserting the ansatz function j(r) from eq. (13) into

eq. (27) yields

13

ei =

sinh()ri

gr3

(cid:16)c 2r2sech2(cr) + 1(cid:17)

(30)

as with all the other solutions, the complex solution carries a magnetic charge of strength

4/g. in addition, by examining the behaviour of the electric eld in eq. (30) as r  

one nds that this complex solution carries an electric charge of 4sinh()/g, which is

the same as that carried by the bps solution. one interesting feature of the solution from

eq. (13) is that even though the space components of the gauge elds are complex all the

physical quantities (e.g. eld energy, magnetic charge, electric charge) calculated from it

are real. also, unlike the solutions of eqs. (10) (12), this complex solution can be viewed as

a point-like dyon since it has a localized electric charge. the main dierence between this

solution and the bps solution is the innite eld energy of the complex solution due to the

eld singularity at r = 0.

while many of the physical characteristics of these various solutions are substantially

dierent in each case, the magnetic charge of all the solutions is the same. this comes about

since the magnetic charge of each solution is a topological charge which carries the same

value for each eld conguration. a topological current, k, can be dened as [35]

k =

1
8

abc a b c

the topological charge of this eld conguration is then

q = z k0d3x =

8 z (ijkabci aj bk c)d3x

1

1

=

8 z ijkabci( aj bk c)d3x

(31)

(32)

for all the solutions one nds that a = ra/r, which is the same regardless of the ansatz

function h(r). in all cases we nd that the topological charge is q = 1. in the next section

when we examine the motion of a test particle in the background eld of the schwarzschild-

like solution we will nd that there is a eld angular momentum due to the interaction of

the test particle with the eld conguration of the schwarzschild-like solution. this eld

angular momentum can be seen to arise from the interaction of the topological magnetic

14

charge with the charge of the test particle, in much the same way that the conguration of

a normal magnetic charge and an electric charge lead to a eld angular momentum [36] [37]

[2].

iv. motion of tests particles in schwarzschild-like potential

we would now like to study the motion of a test particle in the background potential of

the schwarzschild-like solution of eq. (9). we will make several assumptions in doing this.

first we will take our test particle to be a scalar particle as in ref. [18] [20]. one reason

for making this choice is to illustrate the spin from isospin [38] eect that occurs with these

solutions. as discussed in the preceding section all of these solutions carry a magnetic

charge. many researchers have remarked on the fact [36] [37] that the composite system of

a magnetic charge and electric charge carry an angular momentum due to the conguration

of electric and magnetic elds. even when the magnetic charge is topological in character,

as is the case with t hooft-polyakov monopoles, one nds [38] a similar eect whereby the

composite system of a topological magnetic charge and a particle with the charge of the

gauge group, will carry an angular momentum in the gauge elds. this has the interesting

consequence that if one wants to construct fermionic objects from the singular solutions

one should use scalar particle which are in the fundamental representation of the gauge

group  su(2) for the solutions considered here. (fermionic test particles in the adjoint

representation would also give a net fermionic bound state [21]). our second assumption is

that the test particle will be coupled to the scalar eld part of the solution of eq. (9) via the

following substitution m2  (m + aa/2)2 where  is an arbitrary coupling constant. our

nal assumption is to set  = 0 in eq. (9) in order to not have to take the ansatz function

g(r) into account. in this way the scalar particle a moving in the background eld of the

schwarzshild-like solution given in eq. (9) becomes

where we have used igaw a

i i = i(1  k(r))aajirji/r2 = (1  k(r))ala/r2 (la is the

standard orbital angular momentum operator), and (w a

i )2 = aijaikrjrk(1  k(r))2/g2r4 =

2(1  k(r))2/g2r2. since ala does not commute with ara eq. (35) is dicult to handle.

by taking advantage of the free parameter  which occurs in the ansatz functions j(r), h(r)

one can chose  such that esinh = mcosh/g. with this choice the two ara terms in

eq. (35) cancel one another. in order to handle the ala term it is necessary to dene the

total angular momentum operator as

j a = la + sa = la +

1
2

a

(36)

thus the total angular momentum comes not only from the orbital angular momentum,

but has a contribution that looks like a spin angular momentum. the  matrices in the

last term of eq. (36) are, however, connected with the isospin of the system rather than

with spin. this is just the spin from isospin eect [38], and is connected with the fact that

the schwarzschild-like solution of eq. (9) carries a topological magnetic charge. thus even

16

though our system involves only integer spin elds (i.e. w a

 , a, a) the combined system

is a spin 1/2 object. using eq. (36) the ala term can be expanded in the usual way as

ala = 2sala = j 2

op  l2

op  s 2

op except now sop is the isospin operator rather than the spin

operator. finally, we make the simplifying assumption that  = g so that the j(r)2 and

h(r)2 terms may be more easily combined. at this point there seems to be nothing special

in this choice, but we will see that according to the arguments of ref. [18] and [39], the

barrier at r = 1/c will only absolutely conne a particle if   g while for  < g there will

be some probability for the test particle to tunnel through the barrier. combining all the

preceding assumptions we nd

setting x = cr and inserting the ansatz functions k(r), j(r), h(r) from eq. (9) into eq.

where all the non-derivative terms on the left hand side are the eective potential. the key

feature of this eective potential are the singularities at x = 0 and x = 1. now as x  1

(41)

it was argued in refs. [39] [18] that such a singularity would only present a true barrier to

the test particle (i.e. the probability of the test particle tunneling through the barrier would

be zero) if the coecient in eq. (41) were greater than or equal to 3/4. thus the eective

potential of eq. (40) just connes the test particle to remain in the range 0  x  1. the

fact that the eective potential is just able to conne the test particle stems from our choice

of  = g for the coupling of the scalar potential a to the test particle a. if we had taken

 < g then the coecient in the limiting form of the eective potential from eq. (41) would

have been less than 3/4 and the test particle would no longer be conned (e.g. if one took

 = 0 it is straightforward, starting from eq. (35), to show that one gets a coecient of 1/2).

conversely, when  > g then the coecient in eq. (41) becomes greater than 3/4 and the

test particle becomes conned. this has the interesting implication that the scalar potential

plays an important role in this connement mechanism. although, generally connement is

thought to be just the result of the gauge interaction, there are phenomenological studies

[40] [41] [42] which indicate that an eective scalar potential is involved in the connement

mechanism.

to get more detailed in the solution of eq. (40) one must pick particular values of j and

l (which determine the constants d and f in eq. (40)), and solve for the eigenfunctions,

fjl(x) and eigenvalues (e 2  m2)/c 2. in general this must be done numerically [21] [20],

however, the key features of the eective one-dimensional potential of eq. (41) (i.e. the

singularities in the potential at x = 0 and x = 1) make this potential similar to the poschl-

teller potential [43].

where , , v0 are constants. by choosing ,  and v0 correctly the poschl-teller potential

can be made similar to the eective potential from eq. (41). then the known eigenfunctions

and eigenvalues of the poschl-teller potential should give a good approximation to the

eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the potential from eq. (41). the eigenfunctions for the

poschl-teller potential are [43]

fn(x) = ksin(x/2)cos(x/2)

2f1(cid:18)n,  +  + n,  +

1

; sin2(x/2)(cid:19)

(43)

where k is a constant xed by normalization, n is the radial quantum number which takes on

values of n = 0, 1, 2, 3..., and 2f1(a, b, c; x) is the hypergeometric function. the eigenenergies

for the poschl-teller potential are [43]

en =

1
2

v0( +  + 2n)2

(44)

from the shape of both the poschl-teller potential and the eective potential in eq. (41)

this is exactly the kind of dependence one would expect for the energy eigenvalues. for small

energies (i.e.  +  > 2n) both potentials behave like a harmonic oscillator potential and

so one would expect that the leading term in en should go like 2v0( + )n  n. for large

energies (i.e. 2n >  + ) both potentials behave like innite spherical wells, and so one

would expect that the leading term in en should go like 2v0n2  n2. as a simple example

we will consider the l = 0 case for the potential in eq. (41). for l = 0 we nd j = 1/2,

d = 0 f = 0 and the potential in eq. (41) becomes

vef f (x) =

3  8x + 8x2
4x2(1  x)2

(45)

this potential approaches 3/(4(1  x)2) as x  1 so the test particle is just conned to

the range 0 < x < 1. in this range vef f (x) of eq. (45) reaches its minimum value of 4 at

x = 1/2, and the potential is symmetric about this point. in order for the poschl-teller

potential to also be symmetric about x = 1/2, and to also take a value of 4 at this point we

can choose v0 = 1 and  =  = 2. now inserting these into eq. (44) and remembering that

our eigenvalue from eq. (40) is (e 2  m2)/c 2 we nd that the approximate energy of the

bound states for this case with l = 0 is

19

e 2

n = m2 + c 2(2 + n)2

(46)

note that this energy depends on the arbitrary constant c, which sets the radius of the

conning sphere (r = 1/c). as c increases the radius of the spherical shell decreases and

from eq. (46) the energy of the state increases as would be expected. although in this l = 0

case it was particularly easy to determine v0, , , the form of the bound state energy given

by eq. (46) will be similar even when l 6= 0.

v. discussion and conclusions

in this article we have presented a variety of solutions to the eld equations of yang-mills

theory. although nding exact solutions to non-linear eld theories is in general dicult,

many of the present solutions were found by using the mathematical connection which exists

between yang-mills theory and general relativity. since general relativity has been studied

for a longer time than yang-mills theory there exists a body of known solutions which can

serve as guides for nding solutions to the yang-mills or yang-mills-higgs eld equations.

the schwarzschild solution of general relativity, both without and with a cosmological term,

gave rise to the solution with a spherical singularity in eq. (9) and the linearly increasing

solution of eq. (17). although both of these solutions suered from the apparent drawback

of having an innite eld energy, they also exhibited some possible connection with the

connement phenomenon. the linear solution of eq. (17) is of the form of phenomenological

potentials [27] that are often used in studies of heavy quark bound states. in addition lattice

gauge theory arguments [28] favour a linear type of conning potential. the schwarzschild-

like solution of eq. (9) has some similarities to bag models for quark bound states. spherical

singularities, similar to those of the schwarzschild-like solution, were also found to occur in

several other solutions as given in eqs.

(10) (12). actually, the solutions given in eqs.

(10) (12) possessed an innite set of concentric spheres on which the gauge and scalar elds

became innite. thus, such spherically singular surfaces may not be uncommon features of

yang-mills eld theories. the su(2) schwarzschild-like solution can easily be generalized

20

to su(n) [30] by simply embedding the su(2) solutions into an su(n) gauge theory. it has

also recently been found [31] that true su(3) solutions, which are not simply embeddings of

the su(2) solutions, can be given.

in the previous section the behaviour of a scalar test particle placed inside the back-

ground potential presented by the schwarzschild-like solution was examined. in order for

the schwarzschild-like potential to conne the test particle, a, that it was necessary

to couple, a, to the scalar part of the schwarzschild-like solution, a, via the coupling

m2  (m + aa/2)2, where  is the strength of the coupling between a and a. even

with this coupling it was found that connement occurred when   g, while for  < g

there would be some nite probability for a to tunnel out of the spherical well. although

normally it is thought that the connement phenomenon is the result of only gauge in-

teractions, there has been some work [40] [41] [42] which indicates that an eective scalar

interaction may be needed to completely explain connement. another interesting aspect of

the bound state system studied in the previous section is that the total system was a fermion

even though only integer spin elds were involved. the spin 1/2 nature of the bound state

system resulted from the fact that the isospin 1/2 of the test particle a was converted into

spin 1/2 when it was placed inside the schwarzschild-like solution. another way of arriving

at this result is to note that almost all of the solutions presented here could be shown to

carry a topological magnetic charge. thus, in the same way that a standard magnetic charge

- electric charge system carries a eld angular momentum of 1/2 in their combined electro-

magnetic elds, so too the combined charges of the schwarzscild-like solution and a carried

a eld angular momentum of 1/2 in their combined non-abelian elds. if a realistic model

of hadronic bound states can be constructed from these classical eld theory solutions, then

the fact that the net angular momentum of these states does not come entirely from the

constituent particles, may oer a possible explanation of the emc eect [44], which shows

that a large part of the net spin of the proton does not come from the valence quarks.

in addition to the schwarzschild-like solutions presented here it is also possible to take

more complex solutions from general relativity to nd other yang-mills solutions. in ref.

21

[45] the general relativistic kerr solution was used to construct a new yang-mills solu-

tion. although the nal form of the yang-mills kerr-like solution was not as simple as the

schwarzschild-like solutions, it did share the common feature of having conning surfaces

on which the elds became singular. finally it is also possible to use this method for nd-

ing solutions to non-linear eld equations in reverse : starting from known solutions to the

yang-mills equations one can obtain solutions to the general relativistic eld equations [46].
