t -duality and conformal invariance at two loops

dept. of mathematical sciences, university of liverpool, liverpool l69 3bx, uk

s. parsons

abstract

we show that the conformal invariance conditions for a general -model with

torsion are invariant under t -duality through two loops.

i. introduction

duality invariance is a tremendously powerful concept in string theory. one of the earliest

forms of duality to be recognised was that now known as t -duality [1]. this acts to transform

the background elds of a -model so as to map one conformally-invariant background (or

string vacuum) into another conformally-invariant background, at least at lowest order. it

can be understood as a consequence of an isometry of the theory; upon gauging the isometry,

by performing the path integral over the gauge eld and the path integral over a lagrange

multiplier in dierent orders, one obtains two equivalent descriptions of the theory with

backgrounds related by the duality. this duality is straightforwardly checked at lowest order

in ; conformal invariance requires the vanishing of b-functions, one for each background

eld (the metric g, the antisymmetric tensor b and the dilaton ), which are related to

the -functions for the corresponding background elds in a way which we will describe

1

later. one can check that the duality transformations on backgrounds for which the b-

functions vanish lead to dual backgrounds which also have vanishing b-functions. in fact,

this property is equivalent to requiring that the b-functions are form-invariant under duality,

and hence satisfy certain consistency conditions which were derived in ref. [2] (see also

ref. [3]). however, it is far less clear whether, and if so how, the t -duality is maintained at

higher orders in . in ref. [4] for a restricted background, and in ref. [5] for the general

case, it has been found that the two-loop string eective action can be made duality invariant

by a redenition of the background elds (see also ref. [6]). now the b-functions are related

to the string eective action, and so this is grounds for hoping that the b-functions will also

be invariant. however, this is not a fait accompli, as was explained in refs. [2] [7]. certainly

the invariance of the one-loop eective action guarantees the invariance of the one-loop b-

functions. on the other hand, the relation between the action and the b-functions is more

complicated at higher orders. moreover, once one has decided that the elds need to be

redened at higher orders to maintain duality invariance, then the b-functions will also be

modied in a non-trivial way, because eld redenitions lead to changes in the -functions.

for these reasons it seems desirable to investigate explicitly whether the eld redenitions

which make the action duality-invariant also lead to duality-invariant b-functions. this

verication was carried out in ref. [2] for the restricted case of ref. [4]. here we shall carry

out the analysis for a dierent, complementary case which we believe displays most of the

features of the full general situation.

ii. duality at first order

the two-dimensional non-linear -model is dened by the action

s =

1

4 z d 2hg(x)ax bx ab + ib (x)ax bx ab +  r(2)(x)i ,

(2.1)

2

where g is the metric, b is the antisymmetric tensor eld often referred to as torsion, and 

is the dilaton. the indices ,  run over 1,. . . d+1. ab is the metric on the two-dimensional

world sheet, with a,b = 1,2.  = det ab , ab is the two-dimensional alternating symbol and

r(2) the worldsheet ricci scalar. note that b is only dened up to a gauge transformation

b 7 b + []. conformal invariance of the -model requires the vanishing of the weyl
anomaly coecients bg , bb and b (we will refer to these as the b-functions), which are

dened as follows [8]:

bg

 = g

 + 2  + (s),

bb

 = b

 + h 

 +

1
2

h 

 s,

b =  +  +

1
2s.

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

here g , b and  are the renormalisation group -functions for the -model, and h is

the eld strength tensor for b , dened by h = 3[b] = b + cyclic. the vector
s arises in the process of dening the trace of the energy-momentum tensor as a nite

composite operator, and can be computed perturbatively.

it will be sucient to assume

s = (s0, 0). at one loop we have

g(1)
 = r 

1
4

hh 



,

b(1)
 = 

1
2h 

 ,

(1) = 

1
2

 

1
24

h 2,

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

where h 2 = hh . (here and henceforth we set  = 1.)

the conformal invariance conditions are equivalent to the equations of motion of a string

eective action

3

 = z dd+1xgl(m )

where m  (g, b , ). more explicitly, we have to leading order

(1) = z dd+1xge2(cid:20)r(g) + 4()2 

1
12

hh (cid:21) .

from this action it can be shown that

and we have a basis for bm such that bm = (bg

 , bb

 , b) and

b = b 

1
4

gbg

 .

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

we now consider the dual -model. this involves introducing an abelian isometry in the

target space background of the model such that one can perform duality transformations.
background elds will now be locally independent of the coordinate   x 0 and locally
dependent on x i , i = 1, . . . , d. the -model action now reads as

s = z d 2

1

4 hab(g00(x k)ab + 2g0i(x k)abx i + gij(x k)ax ibx j)

+r(2)(x k)) + iab(2boi(x k)abx i + bij(x k)ax ibx j)i

(2.13)

the classical t -duality transformations act on the background elds {g, b} to give dual
background elds {g, b} given by [1]:

g00 =

1
g00

,

4

g0i =

b0i
g00

, b0i =

g0i
g00

,

gij = gij 

g0ig0j  b0ib0j

g00

,

bij = bij 

g0ib0j  b0ig0j

g00

.

(2.14)

the origin of the the two distinct models lies in the order in which one performs simple parts

of the path integral. we shall deal with the transformation on the dilaton later.

we now parametrize the metric and torsion tensors in terms of reduced elds which

appear in the kaluza-klein reduction to d-dimensions [9] [2] [5].

(2.16)

this choice simplies the form of the classical transformations to

a 7

vi  wi,
bij 7 bij = bij + wivj  wjvi.

(2.17)

note that gij is unchanged under duality. it has been shown that a further simplication

in the context of conformal invariance conditions can be employed, since the transformation

properties of the one loop b-functions are manifest when mapped to tangent space [2]. that

is, we construct a vielbein, e 

a , such that

ab = e 

a e 

b g.

(2.18)

in fact we can choose a block diagonal form

with v  e i

 ,

b g

ab = e

these coecients transform as

with the exception of bb

terms of a b-function for one reduced eld, up to factors of g00.

where ai = i ln a, fij = 2 [ivj], gij = 2 [iwj] = h0ij, and hijk = hijk + 3v[igjk]. all
barred tensors and covariant derivatives only have dependence on gij, i.e. that part of metric

that is invariant under the classical t -duality transformations. under the mapping (2.17)
we have ai 7 ai, fij  gij and hijk invariant.  is the reduced dilaton dened by

ln a.

(2.34)

 is another invariant under the duality transformation and this is seen to be case if one

combines the shift in  needed to keep the one loop action invariant [5] with the transforma-

tion on a. the corresponding b-function can be calculated, though it need not be worked

out in full detail. (2.12) simplies to

b = b

.

(2.35)

this is manifestly invariant and indeed this fact is closely related to the invariance of the

reduced one loop string eective action which can be similarly expressed [5]

from a reduced eective action one would expect the equations of motion for the reduced

tensors to reproduce the appropriate conformal invariance conditions. in fact, we have the

the validity of this set of equations at leading order is clear upon inspection of (2.29)(2.33)

and (2.36), together with (2.2)(2.7) and (2.9).from now on we drop the r subscript, since

all quantities will be assumed to be reduced.

iii. duality at second order

we shall now proceed to illustrate the transformation properties of the next to leading

order conformal invariance conditions. we would like to show that the two-loop conformal

invariance conditions behave under duality as in (2.22), but we shall see that we have to

redene the elds in order to achieve this. there are two ways in which we might proceed.

the more direct approach is to calculate the b-functions explicitly for the elds we are

considering. these expressions are very complicated, so we abstain from this. the indirect

method is to consider the corresponding result to (2.10) at second order

(2)

with these relations, we could show the properties under duality of b(2)

m if we knew the

properties of the second order action and those of k (1)

m n . after all we are well informed to

the behaviour of b(1). however we know already that (2) is not the appropriate action.

in fact in ref. [5] it was proved that a shift in the reduced elds is required to obtain an

invariant second order action. the shift in the one loop reduced eective action is then

we now have at our disposal an invariant action which we shall write as

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

(2) = (2) + (1).

(3.10)

however the consequence of (3.6)(3.9) in (3.1) is not just that we have to replace (2)

with (2) but also that the two-loop -functions change, leading consequently to a modied

k-matrix. the new -functions are in general given by:

where

m = m  m

m () = .




m ()  

d
d

m .

(3.11)

(3.12)

the precise details of how we apply (3.12) will be given in the appendix, and moreover we

will leave for later the denition of the redened k-matrix. we now seem to have all the

required apparatus to achieve our task. in the expressions that follow, after all functional

10

derivatives have been taken such as in an equation of motion or m , we will set a = 1 and

 = 0.

we rst turn our attention to the dilaton. this turns out to be the simplest calculation,

mainly because there is no shift in the reduced dilaton, , and consequently the equations of

motion are unaltered. by comparing (2.9) and (2.36) we see that the functional dependence

on  in the unreduced action is the same as on  in the reduced action. therefore (3.2)

(3.14)

and b is given in (2.35). given that the b(1)-functions satisfy (2.22) and that b(1) is

invariant, we conclude that that b(2) is invariant under duality.

we now turn our attention to bg

need to compare two equations of motion and two k-matrices. for the equations of motion,

as can be seen in the appendix, we will deal with functional derivatives with respect to vi

case of the eld equation for wi we keep bij and vi constant (where bij was dened in (1.17)).

correspondingly, we can write hijk either as

or as

hijk = 3 [ibjk] + 3v[igjk]

hijk = 3 [i

of hijk when calculating bv

there is no b

although bij 7 bij , the equations of motion for these two elds are the same. given that
the k-matrix (3.40) is also invariant we conclude that bb(2)

is invariant too.



iv. conclusions

we have shown that the conformal invariance conditions are invariant for a model with

non-vanishing torsion, but where we have set the reduced dilaton  to zero, and taken g00 = a

constant. since the elds require to be redened, the conformal invariance conditions refer

to a redened renormalisation scheme. alternatively, as was done in ref. [5], one could

leave the elds, and hence the renormalisation scheme, unchanged, but instead modify the

duality transformations. the required consistency conditions for the conformal invariance

conditions would then no longer be the simple ones we use, as given for instance in (2.22);

but our results of course guarantee that these new consistency conditions will be satised

through two loops.

16

our results are complementary to those of ref. [2], where the torsion was zero but a non-

vanishing dilaton and non-constant a were used. we believe our results display the main

features of the general calculation and a non-vanishing dilaton and non-constant a could

be incorporated into our results without changing their basic form. as a consequence of

the indirect method of calculation, we have not explicitly computed the various conformal

invariance conditions; but if desired they could be obtained quite straightforwardly from our

nal results using the explicit expression for (2) given in ref. [5]for instance, b g(2)

ij

could

be obtained from eqs. (3.18), (3.19).
