abstract

we consider relativistic and non-relativistic particles and strings in spaces (or
space-times) with a degenerate metric. we show that the resulting dynamics
is described by a rich structure of constraints. all constraints are classied
and the dynamics depends strongly on the parity of the dierence between
the dimension of the space (or space-time) and the rank of the degenerate
metric. for a particular class of degenerate metrics we can identify the null
eigenvectors of the metric with its killing vectors. we also give the rst
steps towards the quantization of the non-relativistic particle using the sen-
janovic path integral quantization and the batalin-fradkin-tyutin conversion
method.

i. introduction

singularities have a fundamental role in general relativity [1]. however it is not clear how
to incorporate them into a quantum gravity theory. surely singularities are an important
feature in quantum gravity as demonstrated by processes like hawking radiation. however
our inability to follow the black hole evaporation process till its very end shows our present
limitations. in string theory the situation is somehow ameliorated. the entropy of extreme
and near-extreme black holes, for instance, can be computed by considering d-branes located
near the horizon [2]. at weak coupling these d-branes are described by a supersymmetric
gauge theory for which it is possible to count the relevant states for the entropy. since the
d-branes are located near the horizon the singularities inside the black hole have not yet
been properly treated in string theory. there are, however, some attempts in this direction
[3].

the singularities which give rise to black holes manifest themselves in the curvature
tensor. the eect of this sort of singularity on the propagation of quantum particles has
recently been studied [4]. there is however another sort of singularity for which the curvature
tensor itself is not singular. they appear when the metric tensor is degenerate and therefore
has no inverse. if the degeneracy occurs on a set of measure zero then the curvature remains
bounded and the topology of the space-time manifold can change [5]. this sort of singularity
is also compatible with the causal structure of space-time [6]. such singularities are milder
than curvature singularities and perhaps it should be easier to handle them in a quantum
gravity theory.

in general relativity degenerate metric appears in the palatini formulation. there we
 . the action is

 and a lorentz connection ab

2 r eaebrcdabcd where ea is the tetrad one-form and r = d + 2 is the curvature two-

start with an action in terms of a tetrad ea
s = 1
form. the space-time metric is then g = ea
ab where ab is the tangent space minkowski
metric. this action and the equations of motion which follow from it do not depend on
the inverse tetrad so they are well dened even when the tetrad ea
 is degenerate. solutions
describing degenerate tetrads have been found and a relation between them and solutions of
two-dimensional bf theories has been established [7]. in a less fundamental level degenerate
metrics also appear as induced metrics on null hypersurfaces [8]. in the four dimensional
case the induced degenerate metric is of rank two.

eb

degenerate metrics or tetrads have also appeared in other contexts. ashtekar formulation
of general relativity employs as phase space variables a complex potential aai and its electric
eld eai in a complexied so(3) yang-mills theory [9]. the usual metric interpretation
of general relativity requires that the spatial metric be proportional to eaiebi. ashtekar
formalism remains well dened even when eai is degenerate. solutions presenting boundaries
in which one of the sides has a degenerate metric have been found [10]. also many gravity
theories in two and three dimensions can be formulated as a gauge theory of the chern-
simons type or bf type [11]. all of them are valid when the zweibein or dreibein are
degenerate. it has also been suggested that there would be a topological phase of quantum
gravity in which the tetrad vanishes and dieomorphism invariance is unbroken [12].

in the context of string theory it has been shown that strings can propagate in degenerate
metric backgrounds. when there are only right or left movers the metric has a degeneracy
of rank two [13]. it is also known that p-branes which behave as instantons are described

2

by a degenerate metric [14]. also, tensionless strings [15] and tensionless d-branes [16] are
governed by a dynamics that involves a degenerate metric.

all this indicates that degenerate metrics may have an important role in quantum gravity.
in fact, if we intend to incorporate degenerate metrics in a quantum theory of gravity
we should rst understand its classical eects. some work has already been done in this
direction. at the classical level the main consequence of the degenerate metrics is to allow
topology change of the space-time manifold [5]. since this is not observed in nature there
must exist a suppression mechanism for it, probably at the quantum level. on the other
side the behavior of matter in space-times with a degenerate metric have not been properly
explored. in the case of topological eld theories the metric appears nowhere in the action so
that the coupling to matter is trivial. only global issues are important in this case. however,
when we consider matter elds with canonical kinetic terms the coupling to gravity requires
the introduction of contravariant tensors elds. the simplest example is the action of the
scalar eld which depends on the inverse metric. to treat these cases an algorithm has been
proposed which does not need any contravariant tensor elds [17]. however there is another
important class of matter which can be coupled to the metric tensor but does not require
contravariant tensor elds. it is constituted by particles and strings. the action and eld
equations of particles and strings do not depend on the inverse metric and are well dened
even when the metric becomes degenerate.

in this paper we will consider the dynamics of particles and strings in spaces or space-
times with a degenerate metric. we will analyze the structure of the constraints imposed by
the degenerate metric and nd the eective degrees of freedom which describe the motion
of particles and strings. we will rst consider the non-relativistic particle in section ii.
a complete analysis of the constraints will be done.
it will be developed in detail since
the constraint analysis of the subsequent sections will be very close to that of the non-
in section iii we will study the relativistic particle and in section
relativistic particle.
iv strings will be considered.
in section v we will analyze the role of the isometries of
degenerate metrics and its relation to the analysis done in the former sections. we will also
consider a preliminary quantization of the non-relativistic particle in section vi. there we
will use the path integral quantization due to senjanovic [18] and also the abelian conversion
method of batalin-fradkin-tyutin (bft) [19]. finally section vii presents some remarks
and conclusions.

ii. non-relativistic particle

usually we interpret a degenerate metric space of dimension d and rank r as a lower
dimensional space with dimension r. however we wish to consider a degenerate metric space
in a broader sense. to implement this consider a set of d vectors in the lower dimensional
space ea
i , i = 1, . . . , d, a = 1, . . . , r. from them we can build a degenerate metric gij =
ea
i eb
jhab, where hab is an euclidean metric, in such a way that gij has rank r. indeed, if we
consider a set of vectors u in the d dimensional space then the equation giju j
 = 0, viewed
as a linear system, has d  r solutions for u since the rank of gij is r. these are the null
eigenvectors of the metric. notice that only in the case that ea
i is locally integrable, that is,
if ea

i = ya
let us now consider a particle of mass m moving in such a space. its lagrangian is

xi , then it describes in fact a r dimensional space.

l =

mgij xi xj =

m xa xbhab,

where xa = ea

i xi. the canonical momentum is

pi =

l
 xi = mgij xj = mea

i xa,

(1)

(2)

where xa = hab xb. because the metric is degenerate we can not invert this equation to nd
the velocity xi in terms of the momentum pi. this means that the system has constraints.
if we consider the null eigenvectors u introduced above we nd that

piu i

 = mgij xju i

 = 0,

so that there are d  r primary constraints

 = piu i
,

 = r + 1, . . . , d.

(3)

(4)

the range of the indice  was chosen in this way for future convenience.

to nd an explicit expression for u we consider, without loss of generality, the rst r

components of eq.(2). they can be solved for the r unknowns xa as

xa =

1
m

ei
a pi,

i = 1, . . . , r,

(5)

where ei
components of the original ea

a is the inverse of ea

i. notice that ea
i . the d  r remaining equations in eq.(2) are then

i is a square matrix build up from the rst r  r

p = mea

 xa = ea

ei

a pi,

which give rise to the constraints found in eq.(4)

the explicit expression for u is then

 = p  ea

ei

a pi.

u i
 = i

(6)

(7)

(8)

this structure is independent of the fact we have chosen the rst r components of eq.(2) to
solve for xa. any other choice would give equivalent results since we are solving algebraic
equations and the constraints are also algebraic.

the canonical hamiltonian can then be found

h0 = pi xi  l =

1

gij 

pipj ,

where gij  = ei

a ej 

b hab is a square r  r matrix. the hamiltonian is then

where  are the lagrange multipliers which implement the constraints .

h = h0 + ,

the poisson algebra of the constraints is found to be

(11)

(12)
(13)

(14)

it should be noticed that the above expression can not be written as a linear combination
of the constraints  since no p appears in it.

in order to perform the analysis of the consistency condition eq.(12) it will be useful to
consider rst the situation where we recover the usual interpretation for a degenerate metric
as a space of lower dimensionality. then we will proceed to the general case.

a. locally integrable case

let us rst consider the situation where ea

j] =
0 everywhere. then we can easily nd that the line element reduces to ds2 = dxadxbhab
showing that the xa are the coordinates of an r-dimensional space.

i is locally integrable, that is, it satises [iea

we then nd from eq.(11) that m = 0 and from eq.(14) that n = 0 so that all
constraints are rst class. the local symmetry generated by the constraints  is found in
the usual way

= {, xi

xi
x = ,

} = ea

ei
a ,

where  is the innitesimal parameter. the lagrangian can then be written as

l =

1
2

mabhab,

a = ea

i xi

+ ea

 x.

(15)

(16)

it is easily veried that this lagrangian is invariant under eq.(15).

now using the gauge freedom in eq.(15) we can gauge away all x so that we are left

with r degrees of freedom xi. the lagrangian eq.(16) then becomes

l =

1
2

mgij  xi

xj 

,

(17)

describing a particle in geodesic motion in a r-dimensional space with a non-degenerate
metric gij .

5

b. non-integrable case

if ea

i is non-integrable then in general m will be non-vanishing. then we have to solve
eq.(12) for the lagrange multipliers . this involves inverting eq.(12) and since m is
an (d r) (d  r) antisymmetric matrix the existence of its inverse will depend on d r.
so there are two possibilities depending whether n vanishes or not.

1. non-vanishing n

let us consider the case when d  r is even. in this case m in general has an inverse

m  so that 1

 = m n.

(18)

all constraints  are then second class. the number of independent degrees of freedom in
conguration space is then 1

2(d + r).
the equations of motion for xi are

gij 

=

xi

1
m
x = ,

pj   ea

ei

a ,

while for p i we get

pi = 

1
2m

i gj k

the lagrangian can be written as

pj pk  i(ea

ej 

a )pj .

l = pi xi

1
2m



gij 

pipj  + piea

ei

a x,

(19)

(20)

(21)

after using the fact that  is a second class constraint. the rst two terms of the lagrangian
describes the motion of a particle in a r-dimensional space with metric gij . however g
depends on x but its momentum piea
a is not independent. therefore the phase space
has 2r + (d  r) = d + r dimensions. there is a geodesic motion in r dimensions and
in the remaining dimensions the motion is constrained by the motion that takes place in r
dimensions.

ei

let us now consider the situation when d  r is odd. now m has no inverse since
det m = 0. also the number of constraints  is odd which means that either there are
rst class constraints among the  or there are new constraints. indeed since eq.(12) can
not be solved for all  it means that there is a relation among n and m not involving

1we assume that m has no null eigenvalues. if they exist further constraints will appear. the
structure of the new constraints will depend explicitly on the form of ea
i and then a general classi-
cation is no longer possible.

6

. since eq.(12) comprises just algebraic equations we can take anyone of them as the new
constraint. let us choose the last component of eq.(12) as the new constraint . then we
can solve the rst d  r  1 components of eq.(12) for the rst d  r  1 components of 
(22)

 

,  = 1, . . . , d  r  1,

= m  

(n + m,drdr),

assuming that m  has an inverse (see footnote 1). the new constraint is then

 = dr = ndr  m  

m,drn ,

where use was made of eq.(22). no dependence of dr is left as it should be.

we also nd the poisson algebra for the new constraint

{, } =


pi

i 


p

 


pi

i,

(23)

(24)

which in general is non-vanishing indicating that the new constraint is second class. the
hamiltonian is now

where  is a new lagrange multiplier. the consistency conditions are now

h = h0 +  + ,

 = {, h0} + 
 = n +  
dr = ndr +  
as before, from eq.(27) we nd 
= m  
then eq.(28) can be rewritten as

 

{, } + dr{, dr} = 0,

m  + drmdr + {, } = 0,
mdr  + {dr, } = 0.

(n + drmdr + {, }).

 + (m  

{, }mdr  + {dr, }) = 0,

(25)

(26)
(27)
(28)

(29)

(30)

which on the constraint surface gives  = 0. finally, eq.(26) allows us to determine dr

dr =  {, h0} + m  n{,  }

{, dr}  m  mdr{,  }

.

(31)

then all lagrange multipliers are determined 2 which means that all constraints are second
class. therefore we have 1
2(d + r  1) independent degrees of freedom in conguration
space. the dynamics is similar to the former case. it describes the motion of a particle in
an r-dimensional metric space with metric g with the momentum being constrained by 
and  so that we have a phase space with 2r + (d  r  1) = d + r  1 dimensions.

2this solution is good if {, dr} + m  
n 6= 0. it is very hard to handle this condition since
it involves explicitly the inverse of m . in all cases we veried this condition is true but we do
not have a general proof of that. if it fails then new constraints would be possible.

7

2. vanishing n

when solving eq.(12) another possibility has to be taken into account. if the degenerate

metric is such that n ij 

 vanishes a little algebra shows that

and

[ec

k] + ea

el

a [k ec

l] = 0,

m i

 = (cid:16)[ec

c .

k(cid:17) ei

]  ea

[eb

]ej 

a ek

b j  ec

(32)

(33)

then we have to solve m = 0 with m given above.

again we have to consider the cases d  r even and odd separately. if d  r is even in
general m has an inverse (see footnote 1) and all lagrange multipliers can be determined
 = 0. all constraints are second class and in conguration space we nd (d + r)/2 degrees
of freedom. the equations of motion for xi are

gij 

pj ,

=

xi

1
m
x = 0,

while for pi we obtain

pi = 

1
2m

i gj k

pj pk.

(34)

(35)

the independent degrees of freedom are then xi and pi.

for d  r odd again m has no inverse so some constraints are rst class or there must
exist new constraints. following the same procedure as before we can solve m = 0 for
d  r  1 lagrange multipliers (,  = 1 . . . d  r  1) leaving dr undetermined

this means that there must exist one rst class constraint which is given by



= m  

mdrdr.

 = dr  mdrm  

 .

(36)

(37)

therefore there are d  r  1 second class constraints  and one rst class constraint 
and consistency gives no more constraints. then we have 2d  (d  r  1) 2 = d + r  1
degrees of freedom in phase space.

iii. the relativistic particle

we will work in a space-time with signature (, +, +, . . .). to avoid problems with
the interpretation of a degenerate metric in a time-like coordinate we will consider only
degeneracy in space-like surfaces. then the world-line of the particle will be well dened.
so we will consider a degenerate metric of minimal rank of 2.

8

the action for a relativistic particle of mass m in a gravitational background is described

in the rst order formalism by

s = z dt(cid:18) 1

2e

g x x 

e
2

m2(cid:19) ,

where e is the einbein. the canonical momenta to e and x are, respectively,

e =

l
 e

= 0,

p =

l
 x = e1g x.

(38)

(39)

assuming that the metric is not degenerate we nd only one constraint e = 0. the
canonical hamiltonian is easily found to be

hc =

e

2 (cid:16)ppg + m2(cid:17) ,

(40)

and consistency leads to the usual constraint p 2 + m2 = 0. both constraints are rst class
and the canonical hamiltonian vanishes as a consequence of the reparametrization invariance
of the action.

when the metric is degenerate we can not invert the velocities in terms of the momenta.
this means that new primary constraints will appear. so let us consider again a metric
of the form g = ea
 ab where ab = diag(1, +1, . . . , +1), and ,  = 0, 1, . . . , d  1,
a, b = 0, 1, . . . , r1. it is easily veried that the determinant of this metric vanishes and that
it has rank r. let us split the range of the curved space indices into ,  = 0, 1, . . . , r  1
and ,  = r, . . . , d  1. with this choice for the metric there is an additional primary
constraint. it is given by

 eb

 = p  ea

 e 

a p ,

and satises the poisson bracket algebra

where

n, o = m,

m = p (cid:18)[h 
n = e pa pd e

] (cid:19) ,
[ h 
]  h
a . the canonical hamiltonian is given by

]  h 
c cd (cid:16)[ea

and h

 = ea

 e

 [ea

](cid:17) ,

where

hc =

e

2 (cid:16) p 2 + m2(cid:17) ,

p 2 = g 

pp ,

g 

= ab

e
a e 
b .

it follows that the the primary hamiltonian is

9

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

(45)

(46)

e

hp =

2 (cid:16) p 2 + m2(cid:17) + e + ,

where  and  are lagrange multipliers for the primary constraints.

the consistency of the primary constraints result in the secondary constraint

and the consistency condition

 = 

1

2 (cid:16) p 2 + m2(cid:17) ,

n + m  = 0.

(47)

(48)

(49)

notice that the consistency of e results in a constraint analogous to usual case with the
important dierence that p which appears in it and has a form which is similar to that of
the non-relativistic case.

assuming that m and n do not vanish we can consider, as in the non-relativistic

particle case, two situations depending on the parity of d  r.
eq.(49) for the lagrange multiplier

in the case with d  r even the inverse of m there exists (see footnote 1) and we solve

 = nm .

(50)

there are then d  r + 1 second class constraints, that is, an odd number of them. this
means that there must exist rst class constraints among them. to nd them let us take
the linear combination

and impose that it is rst class. we then nd

 = f  + f ,

2
e

f n = 0,

f n + f m = 0.

2
e



the solution for these equations are

f  = nm ,

f =

e
2

.

then the rst class constraint is given by

 =

e
2

 + m n.

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

(55)

(56)

therefore there are d  r second class constraints  and one rst class constraint . this
gives d + r  2 degrees of freedom in phase space.
in the case of d r odd there is no inverse for m. proceeding as in the non-relativistic
case we select the last component eq.(49) using the notation  = (, d  r),  = 1, ..., d
r  1. we can then solve for   nding

10

 

= m  (cid:16)n + mdrdr(cid:17) ,

(57)

assuming that m  has an inverse (see footnote 1). the component d  r of eq(49) gives
a new constraint

 = ndr  mdr m  

n.

the set of constraints is now e,  and . from the time evolution of  we get

dr = 

e

2 {, } + m 

nn, o

(cid:16)n, dro  m mdrn, o(cid:17)

.

(58)

(59)

to be sure that the denominator of eq.(59) does no vanish consider the null eigenvector of
m. it can easily be found to be

v  = 



dr  mdr  m    


 .


(60)

we then nd that the denominator of eq.(59) can be written as v {, } and it is non-
vanishing.
we have then found that the lagrange multipliers  and dr are determined. therefore
the constraints  are second class. we have now to nd out which class the constraint 
belongs to. following the same steps as in the non-relativistic case we consider the extended
hamiltonian

h =

e
2

 +  + .

using it to evaluate the time evolution of the constraints we nd that

 = {, } + {, }
= 2
e

n 



2
e

drndr + {, } = 0,

 =

e
2{, } + {, } = 0,

 = n +  

m   + drm dr + {, } = 0,

dr = ndr +  

mdr   + {dr, } = 0.

from eq.(64) we get



= m  (cid:16)n + drmdr + {, }(cid:17) .

(61)

(62)

(63)

(64)

(65)

(66)

from eq.(65) we get  = 0 and from eq.(63) we nd again the result already found in
eq.(59). finally eq.(65) vanishes identically. therefore all lagrange multipliers associated

11

to the constraints  and  are determined showing that they are second class. we also
have that

{, } = 

2
e

n 6= 0,

(67)

so that  is also second class. this gives an odd number of second class constraints for d r
odd. this implies then that there must exist a combination of them which is rst class.
to nd out the rst class combination let us denote the set of second class constraints

as

() = (cid:16), , (cid:17) = (cid:16)(a), (b), ()(cid:17) ,

(68)

and the matrix of the poisson brackets of () as () () = {(), ()} so that det  = 0.
the null eigenvector of , which satises w ()() () = 0, is then

w () = ()

(dr)  (dr) ()() ( )()
( ).

by imposing that the following linear combination of ()

 = w ()(),

is rst class results in

(69)

(70)

 = dr ndr, ()o () ( )( ).
we then have the second class constraints ,  and  and one rst class constraint  so
that there are d + r  5 degrees of freedom in phase space.

(71)

iv. strings

the action for a string in a gravitational background g(x) in d dimensions is given

by

s = 

1

4 z ddhh(a)(b)(,  )g (x(,  ))(a)x(b)x,

(72)

where h(a)(b) is the world-sheet metric, ,  = 0, ..., d  1 and (a), (b) = 0, 1. the equations
of motion are

(a)(hh(a)(b)(b)x)g + h(a)(b)(a)x(b)x = 0,

1

h

t(a)(b) = g((a)x(b)x 

1
2

h(a)(b)h(a)(b)(a)x(b)x) = 0,

(73)

(74)

and do not depend on the inverse of g. therefore the action and equations of motion are
well dened even in the case of degenerate metrics.

in the orthogonal gauge, hab = ab, eqs.(73, 74) reduce to

12

g + x +  +x x = 0,

(75)

x x = 0,

t = g
where  =   ,  = 0 and  = 1.
as we can notice there are chiral solutions for the equations of motion eqs.(75, 76) in the
form +x = 0 or x = 0 which are independent of the metric g [13]. however we know
that the choice of the conformal gauge still leaves a residual symmetry which can be xed
by the gauge choice x+  12(x0 + xd1) = (x+
0 + p  ), where p is a constant. in this gauge
the string coordinate x+ is no longer chiral, that is +x+ 6= 0. if we insist in having a chiral
solution for the other string coordinates we nd that only certain gravitational backgrounds
admit such solutions [13]. they are given by

(76)

g = g,
h,
g+i = i

(77)
(78)
where g, gi, gij and h are functions of x and xi. among these allowed gravitational
backgrounds we can nd some which give rise to a degenerate metric. the most general
form for the metric is given by [13]

gi = gi,
h,
g+ = 

g+j = gij,
g++ = 0,

g+ = 

h,

g++ = 0,

gi = [aix+ + gi(xi)]g+,

g+i = aih + ih,

g = 0,

gij =

g+(igj)

g+

,

(79)

where ai are constants and gi are functions of xj. we then nd that strings satisfying a
chiral condition can propagate in a degenerate gravitational background.

we now develop the hamiltonian formalism in order to nd the constraints when the
metric in eq.(72) is degenerated. introducing the string tension t = 1/(2) we can nd
the momenta densities

p(a)(b) =

l

 h(a)(b)

= 0,

p =

l

 x = thh0(b)(b)xg(x).

when the metric is non-degenerate the primary constraints are

and the primary hamiltonian is

(a)(b) = p(a)(b),

h = z 2

0

d(hc + (a)(b)(a)(b)),

where (a)(b) are lagrange multipliers and hc is the canonical hamiltonian

the secondary constraints do not generate any new constraints. as usual all constraints are
rst class and close the virasoro algebra.

let us now consider a degenerate metric of rank r which can be set in the form g =
ea
 eb
 ab with a, b = 0, 1 . . . r  1. as in the relativistic particle case we will consider
only degeneracy in the space-like directions. the primary constraint eq.(82) is still the
same but the momenta eq.(81) can no longer be inverted for the velocities. following the
development of the relativistic particle we split the space-time indices ,  according to
,  = 0, 1, ..., r  1 and ,  = r, ..., d  1. this allows to dene the inverse of ea
 which is
a square matrix as e
a .

then, besides the constraint eq.(82) there are further primary constraints which can be

written as

where

 = p  ea

 e 

ap ,

p = aea

a = m 0(b)(b)xeb

 ab.

notice that we can write this constraint as

the canonical hamiltonian eq.(84) can then be rewritten as

we now build the primary hamiltonian which will be used to nd the consistency conditions
for the primary constraints. it is given by

14

hp = z (cid:16)hc + (a)(b)p(a)(b) + (cid:17) d,

(93)

where (a)(b) and  are the lagrange multipliers. we then obtain the secondary constraints

1 =

2 =

this allows the canonical hamiltonian eq.(91) to be rewritten as

hc = 

t

h00 h(h)1/22 + h011i .

(94)

(95)

(96)

also the constraint algebra can be obtained. for 1 and 2 we obtain the usual virasoro

algebra

{1(), 1()} = [1() + 1()] (  ),

{1(), 2()} = [2() + 2()] (  ),

{2(), 2()} = [1() + 1()] (  ),

{(), ()} = m ()(  ),

{(), 1()} = ()(  ),

{(), 2()} = n()(  ),

while for  we get

consistency of  then requires

(103)

(104)

(105)

where n() = c()n() and c() = t /(2hh00). this result is similar to those of the
non-relativistic and relativistic particles. again we have to consider separately the cases in
which d  r is even and odd.
1) and eq.(105) can be solved for the lagrange multiplier

let us assume that n 6= 0. for d r even there exists the inverse of m  (see footnote

 = m n.

(106)

we then have a set with an odd number of second class constraints  and 2. we then take
a linear combination of these constraints to select the rst class constraint which is mixed
with the second class ones. we nd that it is given by
 = c2 + nm .

(107)

then we have an even number of second class constraints  and the rst class constraints
, 1 and p(a)(b) resulting in d + r  4 degrees of freedom in phase space.
for d  r odd we follow the same steps as in the former cases. since the determinant of
m vanishes there is a null eigenvector v  such that v m = 0. we then nd the new
constraint v n = 0. the null eigenvector can be obtained so that the new constraint is
written as

 = ndr  mdr  m   

n.

we split the last component of  as (, d  r) and from eq.(105) we get

consistency of  then allow us to determine

 

= m  (cid:16)n + m drdr(cid:17) .

dr = n(), 1

2()o + m 
v n, o

nn, o

,

where

(108)

(109)

(110)

(111)

v {, } = n, dro  m drm  n, o ,

therefore the denominator of eq.(110) is non-vanishing. in this way we have determined
all components of the lagrange multiplier  so that  is second class.

since the hamiltonian has the same form as the relativistic particle hamiltonian we
nd that the lagrange multiplier  vanishes. this implies then that  is a second class
constraint.

we still have to analyze {1, }. a short calculation shows that
{1, } = {px

,v n}

= {p,v }x

n + {x

,v }pn + {p,n}x

v  + {x

,n}pv .

(112)

it is not possible to know whether this vanishes or not since it depends explicitly on the
metric. so if {1, } 6= 0 we have an even number of second class constraints. in this case

16

there are d + r  3 degrees of freedom in phase space. if, on the other side, {1, } = 0 we
have an odd number of second class constraints and again there must be a combination of
them which is rst class. since the structure of the constraints and consistency conditions
are similar to those of the relativistic particle the rst class constraint will have the same
form as in eq.(71). therefore we have the second class constraints , 2 and  and the
rst class constraints 1,p(a)(b) and . in this case there are again d + r  3 degrees of
freedom in phase space. therefore the degrees of freedom counting is independent of the
value of {1, }.

v. isometries and first class constraints

let us consider the role of isometries when the metric is degenerate. we will start with

the non-relativistic particle case. consider the following transformation

where  is a constant innitesimal parameter and k,  = 1, . . . , r represents a set of r
vectors. the lagrangian eq.(1) transforms as

xi = k i
,

(113)

l = 

1
2

m(k l

lgij + gljik l

 + giljk l

) xi xj  m k i

gij xj.

(114)

then the transformation eq.(113) will be an invariance of the action if the lie derivative of
the metric vanishes

(lkg)ij = k m

 mgij + (ik m

 )gmj + (jk m

 )gim = 0,

(115)

that is, if the k are killing vectors. notice that we do not need the inverse of the metric
anywhere so that it applies also to the case of a degenerate metric.
i eb
now let us consider the degenerate metric given by gij = ea

jhab. according to the
analysis made in section ii it has d  r null eigenvectors u i
 which will imply in the d  r
constraints  = 0. these constraints will be rst class if [iea
j] = 0 and the transformations
generated by them eqs.(15) will leave the lagrangian eq.(1) invariant. however if we
consider the transformations eqs.(15) rewritten as

then the invariance of the lagrangian eq.(1) requires that

xi = (t)u i
,

u m
 mgij + (iu m

 )gmj + (ju m

 )gim = 0,

(116)

(117)

that is, (lug)ij = 0. therefore the lagrangian is invariant if there is an isometry of the
degenerate metric with the killing vectors being the null eigenvectors of the metric.
let us remark that the transformation eq.(116) is local in contrast to the non-degenerate
case where the parameter does not depend on time. this is due to the fact that the trans-
formation eq.(116) is generated by a rst class constraint which do not exist for the non-
degenerate case.

17

let us now consider the situation for strings. in the locally integrable case [ea

] = 0 we

have from eqs.(103,104) that

m() = 0,
n() = c(u 

 gx

x

() + 2u 

 gx

()).

(118)

(119)

this form of n does not allow all constraints to be rst class as discussed in section iv.
however, if we consider an isometry condition in the form

 g + gu 
u 

 + gu 

 = 0,

(120)

where u represents a null eigenvector of g then n() = 0. hence  = 0 does not
generate new constraints and we have a set of rst class constraints given by , 1 e 2.
then the theory will have d (d r + 2) = r 2 degrees of freedom in conguration space.
this shows that the isometry condition is necessary in order to reduce all constraints to rst
class ones.

vi. quantization of the non-relativistic particle

in this section we will consider the path integral quantization of the non-relativistic
particle, discussed in section ii, for the case d r even. we recall that in this case there are
only second class constraints. to deal with then we will use the senjanovic formulation [18]
appropriate to handle second class constraints in the path integral and the bft conversion
method [19] which turns the second class constraints into a set of rst class constraints
satisfying an abelian algebra.

in the senjanovic formulation a delta functional of the second class constraints eq.(4)
is inserted into the measure of the path integral as well as the determinant of their poisson
brackets eq.(11), that is

z = z dxi

dx dpi dp det

1

2 m () eis,

where the action is obtained from the hamiltonian eq.(10)

s = z dt (cid:18)pi xi

+ p x 

1
2m

gij 

pipj (cid:19) .

(121)

(122)

we can now perform the integral in p by using the delta functional. we can also exponen-
tiate the determinant by introducing ghost variables . the resulting action is quadratic
in pi so that it can also be integrated out. the nal eective action is then

sef f = 

m

2 z dt gij (cid:16) xi

+ xea

ei
a  m i

(cid:17)(cid:16) xj 

+ xea

a  m j 
 ej 

(cid:17) .

(123)

when performing the last functional integral we get a further determinant in the measure
of the path integral

z = z dxi

dx ddet

1

2 g eisef f ,

18

(124)

2(d  r) from the ghosts  adding up to 1

and this determinant is a functional of xi and x so that the coordinates get mixed up and
the nal form eq.(124) is not very useful. maybe there is a geometrical interpretation for
the eective action eq.(123) but it is not apparent in this form. this of course deserves
further investigation. we still have the right degrees of freedom: r from xi, d  r from x
and  1
we now turn to the abelian bft conversion method. the details of the method can
be found in the original papers [19]. to convert the second class constraints into rst class
ones we need to introduce new variables satisfying certain conditions. to each second class
constraint (t) we associate a new variable (t) which has vanishing poisson bracket
with all other variables and the constraints, and has non-vanishing poisson brackets among
themselves

2(d  r).

{(t), (t)} =  (t  t),

(125)

where  is antisymmetric in its indices. we also introduce new rst class constraints
denoted by  such that

(t) = (t) +

(n)
 (t).



xn=1

if we assume that the rst term in the sum is of the type

 (t) = z dt x(t  t) (t),
(1)

(126)

(127)

and that the new constraints form an abelian algebra we readily nd that x(tt) = (tt),
 = m and no higher order terms are needed in eq.(126). then

{, } = m,
 =  + .

(128)

we can now introduce physical variables xi, pi which have vanishing poisson brackets
with the rst class constraints . assuming an expansion like eq.(126) for each variable
we nd that only the rst correction is needed. the nal result is

 ei
a ,

= xi

xi
+ m ea
x = x + m ,
pi = pi + m i(ea
p = p + m (ea

 ej 
 ej 

a )pj ,
a )pj .

(129)

the rst class hamiltonian is then easily found to be

hc(xi, pi, ) = hc(xi, pi)

=

1
2m

gij 

(xi)(cid:16)pi + m i(ea
a )pk(cid:17)(cid:16)pj  + m j (ea
a )pk(cid:17) ,
 ek
 ek

(130)

and the lagrangian in rst order form reads

19

l = pi xi +

1
2

m   hc   .

(131)

the rst class constraints give rise to gauge transformations which are found by computing
the poisson brackets of the variables with the constraints. the gauge transformations which
leave the lagrangian eq.(131) invariant are

xi =  pi = 0,
 = m,

(132)

where (t) is the gauge parameter. as expected xi and pi are gauge invariant and only
the newly introduced variables are not gauge invariant.

then we were able to transform the second class constraints into a set of abelian rst
class constraints by adding a new variable  which obeys rst order equations of motion
and is pure gauge. we can nd physical variables xi and pi but the resulting hamiltonian
and lagrangian mix the new and old variables. it was not possible to nd a lagrangian or
hamiltonian solely in terms of the new variables.

vii. conclusions

we have analyzed the constraint structure for relativistic and non-relativistic particles
and strings in a background described by a degenerate metric. we have shown that there
is a rich structure behind such systems and that the resulting dynamics is non-trivial. a
common feature of all cases is the consistency condition of the form n + m = 0. it
allow us to repeat the same procedures in the classication of the constraints in all cases.

we have performed a complete classication of the constraints for the non-relativistic
particle. when ea
 is locally integrable all constraints are rst class and the particle has r
degrees of freedom in conguration space. an eective lagrangian can be derived in this
case. on the other side, when ea
 is not integrable we can consider two cases depending
on whether n vanishes or not. for non-vanishing n and d  r even all constraints are
second class and there are 1
2(d + r) degrees of freedom; if d  r is odd all constraints are
still second class but now there are 1
2(d + r + 1) degrees of freedom. for both cases it is
possible to nd the eective lagrangian. in the case of vanishing n and d  r even all
constraints are again second class and the number of degrees of freedom is 1
2(d + r); if d r
is odd then all constraints but one are second class and the remaining one is rst class. in
this case there are 1

2(d + r  1) degrees of freedom.

for the relativistic particle the constraint analysis follows the same lines as in the non-
relativistic case. we have analyzed only the n 6= 0 case. for d  r even there is one rst
class constraint and the remaining ones are second class and the particle has 1
2(d + r  2)
degrees of freedom. for d r odd all constraints are second class and there are 1
2(d + r 5)
degrees of freedom. the cases where n vanishes can be analyzed in the same way as for
the non-relativistic particle.

the same steps can be taken for strings. again we considered only the case when n 6= 0.
for d  r even there are two rst class constraints and the remaining ones are second class.
there are 1
2 (d + r  4) degrees of freedom in conguration space. when d  r is odd all
constraints are second class and describe 1

2(d + r  3) degrees of freedom.

20

when ea

 is locally integrable we can immediately obtain the rst class constraints in the
case of the relativistic and non-relativistic particles. however the same is not true for the
case of strings. at this point the isometries associated to the degenerate metric showed its
relevance since it allowed us to obtain the corresponding rst class constraints. it is also
important to notice that the killing vectors are the null eigenvectors of the degenerate metric
and this must have some geometrical meaning which at moment is beyond our understanding.
the isometries of strings in a gravitational background are important for the formulation
of dual actions [20]. in this description the action obtained from a transformation of the
components of the original metric is classically equivalent to the initial action. the procedure
does not make use of the inverse metric and so a degenerate metric can be used to analyze
this sort of duality. this is presently under investigation.

we also have done an initial study towards the quantization of systems in a degenerate
metric background. we have considered the non-relativistic particle with d r even so that
only second class constraints are present. we have performed the path integral quantization
`a la senjanovic and alternatively using the conversion method of bft which transforms the
second class constraints into rst class ones. the resulting eective actions are complicated
and no geometrical structures can be seen. this shows that more powerful methods of
quantization than those employed here are necessary. it also shows that it is necessary to
get a deeper geometrical insight for the constraints in order to recast the eective actions
in a more compact form. work in this direction is in progress.
