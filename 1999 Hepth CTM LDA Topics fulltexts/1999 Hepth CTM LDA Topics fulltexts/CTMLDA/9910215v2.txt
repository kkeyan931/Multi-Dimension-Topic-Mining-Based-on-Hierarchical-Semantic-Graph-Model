recently, dorey and tateo have investigated functional relations among stokes
multipliers for a schrodinger equation (second order dierential equation) with a
polynomial potential term in view of solvable models. here we extend their studies
to a restricted case of n + 1th order linear dierential equations.

1 introduction

in remarkable papers[1, 2], dorey and tateo nd marvelous connections between a
schrodinger equation with a polynomial potential term and solvable models. the suc-
cess integrates two ingredients. the exact wkb analysis[3]-[10] is on the one side. the
development in studies of solvable models and of the solvability structure in (perturbed)
cft [11, 12, 13, 14] via the thermodynamic bethe ansatz[16, 17] and nonlinear integral
equations is on the other[18]-[22].
in view of the eigenvalue problem in quantum mechanics, h = e, the quantity of
interest is the spectral determinant, det(h  e). for the potential term x2m with m =
integer, it coincides with the vacuum expectation value of a particular member of a

fusion transfer matrices in a certain eld theory possessing uq(csl2) [1, 23]. the rest of

members in the fusion hierarchy are identied with the stokes multipliers and their gen-
eralization [2] in the vacuum sector. thus the result provides a unied view of stokes
multipliers and spectral determinant.
the spectral determinant for the wider class of potentials x2m + ( + 1)/x2 with m
general can be treated within a framework using baxters q operator and the quantum
wronskian relation[24].

we extend a part of studies in [2] to the higher order dierential equation case,

n+1y + (1)n(xm + n+1)y = 0,

(1)

with m integer.
the  = 0 case is essentially equivalent to the turrittin equation of which solutions are
calculated in terms of meijier g functions. there have been several results on this case
[25, 26, 27].

we consider the stokes multipliers associated with eq.(1). they satisfy a set of func-
tional relations in the complex  plane. we will show that nontrivial solutions to relations
are expressible by the quantum jacobi-trudi formula which appears in fusion transfer
matrices related to uq(a(1)

n ) [28, 29].

we note the very recent result in [30] where the eigenvalue problem of eq.(1) is argued

for n = 2 case with x  [0, +] though a related but a dierent method .

2 asymptotic expansion and stokes coecients

we refer [31] to readers for the background on the subject.

let us rst discuss the asymptotic behavior of a slightly generalized dierential equa-

tion,

n+1y + (1)np (x)y = 0

p (x) =

ajxmj

mxj=0

2

(2)

where aj are complex numbers and a0 = 1. p (x) will be referred to as the potential
term in analogy with schrodinger equations. 1 the factor (1)n is not essential. it can be
adsorbed into re-denition of the angle of x and aj1. for later convenience, we include
this factor throughout this report.

now that x =  is an irregular singular point of the equation, analytic properties
of solutions depend on sectors in the complex x plane. let sk be a sector in the plane
satisfying

|argx  k| 


2

for x  sk, where  = 2
solution in s0. following [33, 34], we dene bh(h = 1, 2,    ) by the relation,

m+n+1. we then study the asymptotic behavior of a subdominant

(1 +

a key function e(x, a) is determined by bh,

e(x, a)

xm/(n+1)+1h

where hm = n for m = n(n + 1)  j, (j = 1,    , n). here a stands for (a1, a2,    , am)

in addition, we introduce an exponent m by

m =

nm
2 ,
nm
2 + (n + 1)bhm+1,

for m 6= 0 mod n + 1
for m = 0 mod n + 1 .

(3)

then we have a theorem,

theorem 1 in s0, there exists a subdominant solution y(x, a) to eq.(2) which admits the
following asymptotics,

y(x, a)  xm/(n+1)ee(x,a),

jy(x, a)  x(jmm)/(n+1)ee(x,a),

j  1.

(4)

the range of the existence of the asymptotic expansion (4) (forgetting the subdomi-
nance) actually extends over s0. the precise determination of the range, however, poses
a nontrivial problem even for n = 1 case. see elaborate discussions in sections 9 and 10

1 in the case of singularity at innity of rank 1, i.e., p (x) = p0 + p1/x +    in the above, asymptotic
solutions and numerical algorithms are discussed in [32] for a wider class of higher order dierential
equations.

of [34]. the straightforward extension of the argument may lead to the conclusion that
y(x, a) admits the asymptotic expansion (4) in an open sector,

argx <

n + 2

m + n + 1

.

(5)

see the appendix.

the intriguing feature in the dierential equation (2) is the following symmetry in

rotating the x plane.

theorem 2 denote the above solution by y(x, a). then

yk(x, a) := y(xqk, g(k)(a))qnk/2

(6)

is also a solution to eq.(2).

the parameter q signies exp(i) = exp(i
g(k)(a) = g(1)(g(k1)(a)), k  2 and g(1)(a) = (a1/q, a2/q2,    am/qm).

m+n+1). the operation g(k)(a) is dened by

2

a fundamental system of solutions (fss) in sk is formed by (yk, yk+1,    , yk+n). this
is shown for the turrittin equation in [27]. for general, it is not simple to show this
directly. we use the range of the validity of asymptotic expansion in eq.(5) and justify
the linear independence as follows.

we introduce a (n + 1)  (n + 1) matrix k(x) and the wronskian wk := detk(x)

k(x) :=

.

(7)

then eq.(5) implies that yk+j, j = 0,    , n has the asymptotic expansion (6) in the
closed sector sk+(n+1)/2  sk+(n1)/2. as wk is constant in x, one then veries the lin-
ear independence of these solutions by using the asymptotic expansions (4) and (6) in
sk+(n+1)/2  sk+(n1)/2. see discussions in [34] for n = 1 and [30] for n = 2

we stress that the argument below depends on the existence of k(x) as fss, rather

than (5).

the column vector, (yk, yk,    , nyk) is inserted in the jth column in the matrix of
the denominator. especially,

 (n+1)
k

= (1)nwk+1/wk.

(11)

then we restrict ourselves to the case of our interest (1). we nd that bhm+1 = 0 and
thus m = nm/2 for any m. under the operation of g(1), g(1)(am) = amqm = amqn+1.
as am = n+1, this means g(1)() = q. thus a function in the k th sector has an
argument qk.

3 recursion relations

by the commensurability of the cone angle of sk to 2, the product of successive m+n+1
stokes matrices must be a unit matrix [33] modulo sign factor due to the normalization
in (6).

s(1)
m+ns(1)

m+n1    s(1)

0 = (1)ni.

regarding as a function of , s(1)

k = s(1)(qk). thus eq.(12) reads,

s(1)(qm+n)s(1)(qm+n1)    s(1)() = (1)ni.

the same relation can be recapitulated in terms of a generalized stokes matrix s()
k
necting k and k+ [2, 31],

k = k+s()
k .

similar to the above, s()
eq. (13) is obviously rewritten as,

k = s()(qk) as a function of .

s(m+n+1)() = (1)ni.

by the above denition, we have two equivalent recursion relations

s(+1)() = s(1)(q)s()()
= s()(q)s(1)().

we denote the (i, j) component of s()() by s()
the main problems in the present report are

i,j ().

(1) the expression of s()

i,j () in terms of  (a)()s

(2) restrictions imposed on  (a)()s by functional relations among them.

the rst recursion relation (16) imposes the relations,

s(+1)
k,j

() =  (k)(q)s()

1,j () + s()

k+1,j()

(1  k  n + 1)

(18)

where we formally put s()

n+2,j() = 0

the second recursion relation (17) yields,

s(+1)
k,1

and

() =  (1)()s()

k,1(q) +  (2)()s()

k,2(q) +

   +  (n+1)()s()

k,n+1(q)

s(+1)
i,j+1 () = s()

i,j (q)

(1  i  n + 1, 1  j  n).

the latter equation leads to

for  < j,

s()
i,j+1() = s(j)

i,1

(qj)

  j.

s(+1)
i,j

() = s(1)

i,j(q),

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

and the rhs is given directly in terms of  (a). thus we regard only s()
elements.

the eq. (19) can be rewritten such that it contains only s()

k,1 as nontrivial

k,1 in the lhs. let us write

explicitly for k = 1,

s(+1)
1,1

() =  (1)()s()

1,1(q) +  (2)()s(1)
1,1
(qn+1).

(23)

we remark properties of s()

1,1() from linear independency of fss. the (1,1) component

of eq.(14) for  = m + j, 1  j  n reads,

yk = s(m+j)

1,1

yk+m+j +    .

k+m+j consists of (yk+m+j, yk+m+j+1,    , yk+m+n+j). as yk+m+n+j = (1)nyk+j1, it con-
tains (1)nyk. thus the linear independency of solutions concludes at least

s(m+j)
1,1 = 0,

1  j  n.

(24)

we also note a trivial relation, s(m+n+1)

1,1

= (1)n.

in the next section, we will show that a set of solutions to the above recursion relations

can be neatly represented by the quantum jacobi-trudi formula.

ers

the recursion relation (23) can be successively solved for given initial conditions
 (1)(),    ,  (n)() (forward-propagation). conversely,  (a)() is expressible by these so-
lutions (back-propagation).

to represent these, we employ notations useful in later discussions,

() = s()

t (1)

t (a)
1 () = (1)a+1 (a)(q(a1)/2)

1,1(q(1)/2)

(= (1)a+1s(1)

a,1(q(a1)/2)).

we rst state the result for the forward-propagation problem,

t (1)

+1() = det(cid:16)t (1i+j)

1

(q(+2ij)/2)(cid:17)1,i,j+1

.

(25)

(26)

(27)

the rhs includes the formal extension of t (a)
a  n + 2 or a < 0 and t (0)

1 () = 1 .

1 (), and we understand t (a)

1 () = 0 for

the proof is easy by the induction on . the case  = 0 is trivial by denition. assume
that eq.(25) is valid up to . expanding the determinant with respect to the last column,
we have

t (1)
+1() = t (1)

1 (q/2)t (1)
+    + (1)a+1t (a)

(q1/2)  t (2)
1 (q(+1a)/2)t (1)

1 (q(1)/2)t (1)



+1a(qa/2) +   

1(q)

(28)

here we set t (1)



() = 0,  < 0 and t (1)

0 () = 1.

by eqs. (25), (26) and from the assumption of the induction , the lhs is equal to that
in eq.(23) after   q/2. then the validity of eq.(25) carries over into  + 1, which
completes the proof.

next consider the back-propagation problem. we regard the coupled equations (23) for
 = 0, 1, 2,    , n, as a set of linear equations for  (a)() (or t (a)
1 ()). the cramers theorem
is again applicable. taking account of the fact that the determinant of the coecient
matrix is unity, we have,

t (a)

1 () = det(cid:16)t (1)

1i+j(q(i+ja1)/2)(cid:17)1,i,ja

.

(29)

it is natural to dene t (0)

1 () = 1 from this expression.

we notice the similarity of eqs. (27) and (29) to the jacobi-trudi formula for schur
functions [35]. it states that any complex schur function associated to a skew young
diagram can be represented in terms of a determinant of a matrix whose elements are
given by elementary schur functions.

we nd a quite parallel result in the present problem. thanks to the argument around
eqs.(21) and (22), only s()
k,1() is of our interest. this turns out to have a compact ex-
pression in a similar manner to the jacobi-trudi formula, which we call the quantum
jacobi-trudi formula.

7

to state this, we prepare some notations. by , we mean a young diagram (1, 2,    )
and by , its transpose. consider a skew young table of the shape / = (1  1, 2 
2,    ) such that i  i. we dene a quantity associated to /,

t/() := det1j,k

1(t (1)

j kj+k(q(

11+j +kjk+1)/2)).

(30)

it contains eq.(29) as a special case  = (1, 1,    , 1) and  = .

a generalization of eq.(27) also exists. to show this, consider two matrices h and e

with entries

hi,j

ei,j

:= (1)ijt (1)
:= t (ij)

1

(q(i+j)/2).

ij(q(i+j)/2),

clearly, deth = dete = 1 as they are lower triangular with all diagonal elements unity.
the expansion of eq.(27) with respect to the 1st column leads to

0 = t (1)

+1() + t (1)

1 (q/2)t (1)



(q1/2)  t (2)

1 (q(1)/2)t (1)

1(q1)

+    + (1)a+1t (a)

1 (q(+1a)/2)t (1)

+1a(qa/2) +   

which is equivalent to

i,j =xk

(1)ikt (1)

ik(q(i+k)/2)t (kj)

1

(q(k+j)/2).

hence e and h are inverse each other.

these two facts are sucient for the second representation of t/ [28, 35, 39],

(
t/() = det1j,k1(t
1

j 

kj+k)

(q(

11

j 

k+j+k1)/2)).

(31)

eqs. (30) and (31) coincide with the jacobi-trudi formula by dropping the  dependencies.

we have the following statement on nontrivial stokes multipliers.

theorem 3 the solution to the recursion relation (18) for j = 1 is given by

s()
k,1() = (1)k+1t(q(+k2)/2),

(32)

where  is a young diagram of the hook shape  = (, 1,    , 1) with height k.

the proof is as follows. in terms of t , we need to show

t() + t() = t (k)

1 (q/2)t (1)



(qk/2),

where () is also the hook young diagram  = ( + 1, 1,    , 1), ( = (, 1,    , 1))
with height k (k+1). then the equality is veried by expanding the determinant associated
to t() with respect to the rst row.

8

it remains to show the consistency of eq. (32) with eqs. (18) (k = n + 1 and j = 1)

and (15).

first, consider k = n + 1 and j = 1 of eq.(18). by the recursion argument in the
n+2,1(), dened by the rhs of eq.(32), must be zero. this is

above, the formal extension s()
directly seen from the second expression (31), as t (a)

1 () = 0, (a  n + 2).

next we deal with eq.(15). to be precise we will show

s(m+n+1)
i,j

() = t (1)

m+n+1(q(m+n)/2)i,j

(= (1)ni,j.

(33)

with slight re-denition of index j and the application of the relation (21), this is

converted into an equivalent form,

s(m+j+1)
i,1

() = t (1)

m+n+1(q(m+n)/2)i+j,n+1

(0  j  n).

(34)

i,1

we shall divide argument into two cases, j 6= 0 and j = 0.
for j = 0, we apply eq.(32) to s(m+1)
(). then we nd from the formula (30) that the all
elements of the rst row are zero unless i = n + 1. this comes from eq.(24), tm+j () = 0
for 1  j  n. for i = n + 1, we expand the determinant with respect to the last
column. from the normalization in eq.(32) and t (1)
n+1,1 () =
t (1)
m+n+1(q(m+n)/2), which is (1)n by denition.
a remark

m () or t (n+1)

must hold. neither t (1)
() has poles. thus eq.(35) asserts that they are
also nonzero everywhere. consequently they are constant. we drop their  dependen-
cies for the time being. by taking the determinants of both sides of (matrix form of)
eq.(33), one obtains (t (n+1)
m+n+1)n+1. being combined with eq.(35), this
yields, (t (n+1)
m are root of unity. the
former can be derived directly once if we assume (5) and use (11). one only has to evaluate
wk using asymptotic forms (4) and (6) in sk+(n+1)/2 sk+(n1)/2. the simple manipulation
yields  (n+1)
for j 6= 0, the recursion (18) yields,

we then try to prove eq.(34) by induction on the upper index, starting from the re-
sult for s(m+1)
() as the initial condition. in each induction step, however, i = n + 1
component is indeterminate from eq.(37). we then use eq.(31) and nd s()
n+1,1() =

(q()) where () and () are some shifts irrelevant in the
present argument. this supplies the missing pieces. as   m + 2 for the case under
consideration, these are null. we then immediately check that eq.(34) holds.

thereby, we prove that nontrivial stokes multipliers are explicitly given via formula
(32). the fundamental quantities  (a) s are not all independent. constraints (24) impose
complex algebraic equations among them.

we note useful relations among t s, the t  system. let t (a)

rectangle of height a and width . by applying the plucker relation to eq.(30) or eq.(31),
one nds,

the boundary conditions are t (1)

nite number of relations with nite number of t (a)

() = 0
() = 1 if a = 0 or  = 0. the last relation comes from the null dimensionality of
<0() = 0, (1 
m+j() = 0 (1  a, j  n). thus the t  system constitutes

m+1m+n() = t (a<0)

<0() = 0 leads t (a)

() = t (a>n+1)

().

remark that the case with n = 1 , m = 3 and with multi-parameters has been found
in [34] by direct calculation of recursion relations. the one parameter result has been later
extended to arbitrary m by similar argument employed here [2].

summarizing this section, we have found determinant representations of stokes multi-
pliers. we conveniently introduce a subset of huge hierarchy, t (a)
() including (the most
fundamental) stokes multipliers  (a)(). then the functional relations exist among them
which, in turns, impose some restrictions on  (a)().



we will discuss above results in view of solvable models in the next section. especially

we will give some follow-up of the last sentence in the previous paragraph.

5 functional relations in solvable models and ther-

modynamic bethe ansatz

hereafter we assume n odd and m = m(n + 1). it is then convenient to rotate the  for
the dierential equation (1) by 

2 . we will use the same notation for the resultant .

in the rst part of this section, we remind of some concrete results in solvable models.
the second part is devoted to a rather speculative discussion of the possibility of the
application of thermodynamic bethe ansatz to the evaluation of stokes multipliers.

the commuting transfer matrices play a fundamental role in studies of solvable lattice
models and eld theories [11, 12, 13]. the members in a commuting family share the same
physical space ( quantum space) and are parameterized by the (multiplicative) spectral

n ), there exists a irreducible module w (a)

parameter . they are labeled by the auxiliary space of which trace must be taken. these
auxiliary spaces are identied with irreducible modules of yangian or quantum ane lie
algebra [37, 38]. for uq(a(1)
m (), (a  n) which
is isomorphic to mva as a classical module. naturally, we associate a young diagram of
a  m to this module, and write the corresponding transfer matrix t (a)
m (). since they are
commutative, we consider transfer matrices on common eigenstates. thus we sometimes
do not distinguish operators from their eigenvalues.
in the language of solvable lattice models, t (a)

m () is a transfer matrix of a model
obtained by the fusion procedure. starting from a fundamental model acting on v1 
v1, we can recursively derive fusion models. their auxiliary spaces are constructed from
v1   v1 by applying appropriate projectors. we utilize singular points of r matrix
for construction of these projectors.

the fusion procedure is not restricted to the rectangle type. generally, there exists
a module w/(), or a fusion model, parameterized by a skew young diagram /. we
write the corresponding transfer matrix as t/().

the short exact sequence of irreducible modules examined in [36, 28, 29] leads to the

relation which we have seen in eq.(30),

we start from the lattice model. then we take the scaling limit (or the eld theoretical
limit) which has been discussed in several literatures. in the present context, we refer to
[42]. note that our transfer matrices are not mere sums of products of boltzmann weights
but are imposed overall renormalizations due to t (a)

then eq. (42) can be transformed into coupled nonlinear integral equations by the

standard trick[17, 43, 12, 13, 44, 45].

the both sides of eq. (42) are analytic with nitely many distinct zeros and have

at this stage, one performs the eld theoretical limit , system size  , lattice spacing

this condition depends on the regime of the lattice model. we shall skip that detail here.

the resultant coupled integral equations can be recursively solved and yield a unique set
of solutions to y (a)
,k } and m (a)
. thus one must
adopt appropriate choice of these parameters to reproduce proper t (a)
((u)) including
 (a)(). conversely, if two sets of functions satisfy the same relation (38) and share the
same {u(a)

((u)) for given {u(a)

,k } and m (a)

, then they are identical in the strip.
for solvable lattice models, the case studies on uq(a(1)

1,2,3) indicate that t (a)

,k } = , a = 1,    n for all p  m.

((u)) does
not possess zeros in the strip u  [1, 1] when acting on the largest eigenvalue sector.
that is, {u(a)
this seems to be also the case with stokes multipliers. actually this is the case for
n = 1. that is, the proper stokes multipliers are reproduced by {u(a)
,k } = , a = 1,    n
for all p  m but dierent choice of m (a)
from lattice models or eld theoretic model.
let me just present some argument for n  2 case. assume that the solution to eq.
(35) is simple, t (n+1)
m = 1. as remarked above, the former equality is a direct
consequence of (5) and (11). from our boundary conditions, the t  system is then
invariant under the simultaneous transformations (a, )  (n + 1  a, m  ). this implies
t (a)
(). then a

the simplest solution, (a)
solution, we conclude {u(a)

,k } = , a = 1,    n for all p  m also for stokes multipliers.

we do not expect ill-behavior for small angle sector of ;  (a)() might not be vanishing
is

in the sector, or otherwise it harms linear dependency of fss. the above choice of (a)
consistent with this expectation.



admitting these assumptions, we have a conjecture

conjecture 1 the stokes multipliers of eq.(1) are given by vacuum expectation values
of fusion transfer matrices related to uq(a(1)
n ). thus they are evaluated from eq.(46) by
forgetting the second term in the rhs .

the parameters m (a)



, d(a)

 must be tuned correctly as in [1] for n = 1.

to be precise, overall normalization of  for the identication is not xed by func-
tional relations only. for n = 1 the determination of this factor is quite straightforward
[1, 2], due to the fact that only one subdominant solution exists in each sj. the spectral
determinant is then identied with the fusion stokes multiplier which connects the sub-
dominant solution on the negative real axis to the dominant solution on the positive real
axis. then standard wkb arguments yield the identication of parameters, especially
m (1)

and the normalization of .



this can not be generalized straightforwardly for n  2. let me just comment on two
fundamental problems. first, the meaning of eigenvalue problem is not necessary clear for
higher order dierential equations. the characterization of the eigenspace (it is the hilbert

14

space for n = 1) is not obvious. second, more technically, there are several subdominant
solutions in each sector. we hope to clarify these issues in future publications.

finally we comment on the (1,1) component of eq.(8).

yk =  (1)

k yk+1 +  (2)

k yk+2 +    +  (n+1)

k

yk+n+1.

(47)

the equation coincides with the baxters t  q relation for n = 1 by putting x = 0
and writing yk(x = 0) = q(qk+const.). for general n, this coincides with the spectral
curve equation argued in [46] or the characteristic equation in the quantum separation
of variables [47].

6 discussion

the deformation parameter q = exp(i

we have seen that stokes multipliers associated to a n + 1 th dierential equation satisfy
the same recursion relations with fusion transfer matrices related to uq(a(1)
n ). under the
assumption on analyticity of some functions in the strip, we conjecture thermodynamic
bethe ansatz type equations eq.(46) which determine stokes multipliers. the assumption
, however, needs extensive numerical check, which we hope to report in the near future.
m+n+1 ), which arises naturally in the present
context, has a concrete meaning in the solvable models. the parameter m species the
level of dominant integral weight of the local variables in the lattice model[48]. then
the denominator of the exponent of q is of the form, level + dual coxeter number. this
combination also appears as the deformation parameter of a solvable model based on
other ane lie algebras [49]. we thus expect a possible extension of the present study to
other type of potential terms related to other ane lie algebras.

we dene a new variable  by n+1 = x. put u = mt w such that m = diag(1, m, 2m,    )
and that t diagonalizes a matrix of the form a(x) in the above with p (x) = 1. then the
equivalent matrix equation is written in the form

d

w = m+nb()w = m+nxj=0

we are interested in eq.(4). for this, it may be enough to treat j = n + 1. assume
there exists appropriate choice of m, then lemma 3 of [33] also applies in this case. the

where  is positive and small. by denition, h(n+1)

as ||  . hence the solution converges to the asymptotic expansion form. it may be
shown that the limit does not depend on r as in [33, 34]. the condition (51) coincides,
when written in terms of x, with (5).
