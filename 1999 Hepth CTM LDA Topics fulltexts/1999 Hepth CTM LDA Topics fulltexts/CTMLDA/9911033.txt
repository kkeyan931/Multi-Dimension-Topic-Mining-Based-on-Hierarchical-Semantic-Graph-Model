(13) (14) (15) 2 quantity (0)(0) must considered regularization. equation (15) similar equation propagator leading approximation 1/n - expansion. certainly, similarity completely supercial, since principle construction approximation scheme dierent. solution equation (15) free propagator (0) = (2 2)1 renormalized mass 2 = m2+4(0)(0). quantity (0)(0) dened self-consistency condition. propagator rst derivative g() source : g1 = g | =0. easily seen, simply (0) leading approximation. notice, generating functional (14) leading approximation possess complete bose-symmetry. really, follows denition generating functional, bose-symmetry implies full generating functional condition 2g (y, x)(y , x) = 2g (y , x)(y, x) . (16) evidently condition (16) fullled g(0) dened eq.(14). violation condition leads particularly violation connected structure leading approximation two-particle (four-point) green function. situation rather typical nonperturbative calculational schemes bilocal source (for example, 1/n -expansion bilocal source formalism), discrepancy type obstacle using iteration schemes. really, condition (16) satised full generating functional g exact solution sde. clear approximate solution may possess properties exact one. given case situation. properties connectivity bose-symmetry higher green functions, fullled rst steps iteration scheme, improves subsequent steps. example, structure disconnected part two-particle function reconstructed early rst step iteration scheme. subsequent 3 steps correct connected structure many-electron functions corollaries bose-symmetry reconstructed. stepwise reconstruction exact solution properties natural given iteration scheme based approximation generating functional g() vicinity zero. green functions coecients generating functional expansion vicinity zero, therefore lowest functions well-described rst steps approximation leading approximation propagator only. higher many-particle functions come play later, following steps, relation (16) fullled exactly go toward exact solution. general case, solution equation i-th step iteration scheme functional g(i) = p (i)g(0), p (i) polynomial degree 2i. therefore i-th step computation green functions reduces solving system 2i linear integral equations. solution rst step equation g(1) = p (1)g(0) p (1) = 1 2 f 2 +(1). function f two-particle (four-point) function rst step, (1) rst-step correction propagator. eq.(13) = 1 gives us system equations f (1). equations f (1) simple linear integral equations. exact form solutions equations see {$9606155$}. 0 rst step propagator reproduces correctly rst term usual ccp theory. = 1 model action (6) describes quantum-mechanical anharmonic oscillator. ultra- violet divergences absent, quantities (0)(0) type nite formulae applied directly computation green functions. calculate ground state energy e one use well-known formula de = g2(0, 0, 0, 0), g2 four-point (or two-particle) function. integrating formula boundary condition e( = 0) = m/2 taken account, one calculate ground state energy values coupling (see {$9606155$}). 0 0 rst step calculation reproduces perturbation theory second order. : e = 01/3 + o(1/3), 0 = 0.756. coecient 0 diers 13% exact = 0.668. /m3 = 0.1 result calculation diers exact numerical numerical one exact one 0.8% /m3 = 1 diers 6.3%. therefore, rst step calculations approximate ground state energy values accuracy varies smoothly 0 (at 0) 13% (at ). 2 action (6) added counterterms elimination ultraviolet divergences. need add counterterm wave function renormalization leading approximation, equation leading approximation 4( + 0) 2g(0) + (m2 0 + m2 2) g(0) g(0) = 0.
