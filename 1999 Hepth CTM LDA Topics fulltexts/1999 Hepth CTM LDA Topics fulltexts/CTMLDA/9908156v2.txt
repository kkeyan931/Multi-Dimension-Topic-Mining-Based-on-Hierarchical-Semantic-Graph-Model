new regularization using domain wall

abstract

we present a new regularization method, for d dim (euclidean) quantum
eld theories in the continuum formalism, based on the domain wall cong-
uration in (1+d) dim space-time. it is inspired by the recent progress in the
chiral fermions on lattice. the wall height is given by 1/m, where m is
a regularization mass parameter and appears as a (1+d) dim dirac fermion
mass. the present approach gives a thermodynamic view to the domain wall
or the overlap formalism in the lattice eld theory. we will show qualitative
correspondence between the present continuum results and those of lattice.
the extra dimension is regarded as the (inverse) temperature t. the domains
are dened by the directions of the system evolvement, not by the sign of
m as in the original overlap formalism. physically the parameter m controls
both the chirality selection and the dimensional reduction to d dimension (do-
main wall formation). from the point of regularization, the limit mt  0
regularize the infra-red behaviour whereas the condition on the momentum
(k) integral, |k|  m, regularize the ultra-violet behaviour.
to check the new regularization works correctly, we take the 4 dim qed
and 2 dim chiral gauge theory as examples. especially the consistent and
covariant anomalies are correctly obtained. the choice of solutions of the
higher dim dirac equation characterizes the two anomalies. the projective

1 introduction

regularizing quantum theories respecting the chirality has been a long-
lasting problem both in the discrete and in the continuum eld theories. the
diculty originates from the fact that the chiral symmetry is a symmetry
strongly bound to the space-time dimension and is related to the discrete
symmetry of parity and to the global features of the space-time topology.
non-continuous property is usually dicult to regularize. ordinary regular-
izations, such as the dimensional regularization, often hinder controlling the
chirality. the symmetry should be compared with others such as the gauge
symmetry of the internal space and the lorentz symmetry of the space-time.
in the lattice eld theory, the diculty appears as the doubling problem of
fermions[1] (see a text, say, [2]) and as the nielsen-ninomiya no-go theorem
[3]. the recent very attractive progress in the lattice chiral fermion tells us
the domain wall conguration in one dimension higher space(-time) serves
as a good regularization , at least, as far as vector theories are concerned
2 [4, 5]. it was formulated as the overlap formalism[6, 7] and was further
examined by [8, 9, 10]. the corresponding lattice models were analyzed by
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. the numerical data also look to support its validity[16].
most recently the overlap dirac operator by neuberger[17], which satises
ginsparg-wilson relation[18], and luschers chiral symmetry on lattice[19]
makes the present direction more and more attractive.

the present motivation is to nd a counter-part, in the continuum,
of the above regularization on lattice. through the analysis we expect to
clarify the essence of the regularization mechanism more transparently than
on lattice. we see some advanced points over the ordinary regularizations
in the continuum eld theories. the main goal is to develop a new feasible
regularization, in the continuum formalism, which is compatible with the
chiral symmetry.

the overlap formalism has been newly formulated using the heat-kernel[20].

the heat-kernel formalism is most eciently expressed in the coordinate
space[21], and which enables us to do comparison with the lattice formalism.
we will often compare the present results with those obtained by the lattice
domain wall approach. the present formalism is based on three key points:

2 we do not touch on the chiral gauge theories except some argument in the second

paragraph of sect.8.

3

1. we utilize the characteristic relation of heat and temperature, that
is, heat propagates from the high temperature to the low temperature
(the second law of thermodynamics).
in the system which obey the
heat equation, there exists a xed direction in the system evolvement.
we regard the heat equation for the spinor system, after the wick
rotation, as the dirac equation in one dimension higher space-time.
and we consider the (1+4 dim classical) conguration which has a
xed direction in time. this setting is suitable for regularizing the
dynamics (in 4 dim euclidean space) with control of the chirality.

2. anti-commutativity between the system operator d and the chiral ma-
trix, that is, 5 d + d5 = 0 plays the crucial role to separate the whole
conguration into two parts (we will call them (+)-domain and (-
)-domain) which are related by the sign change of the time-axis.
this is contrasted with the original formulation of the overlap where
the dierence of two vacua, one is constructed from the (+) sign reg-
ularization (1+4 dim fermion) mass and the other from the (-) sign,
distinguishes the two domains.

3. taking the small momentum region compared to the regularization
mass scale m regularize the ultra-violet divergences and, at the same
time, controls the chirality.

in this paper we further examine the new approach and strengthen its
basis for the establishment. in order to show that the present approach is a
new regularization for general eld theories, the regularization mechanism is
systematically presented. three kinds of wall congurations appear depend-
ing on the choice of propagators (regularization).
in the regularization of
momentum-integral, some characteristic functions ( sine integral functions,
incomplete gamma functions, etc) appear. because the presented pertur-
bation calculation is not so familiar, the description of calculation is rather
explanatory so that readers can follow them. the main points in the present
analysis are as follows.

1. the extra axis is interpreted as the (inverse) temperature. this formal-
ism gives a thermodynamic view on the domain wall algorithm. as the
extra axis, it should be a half line ( not a line ) like the temperature.

4

2. the characteristic condition of the present regularization : |k|  |m| 

1/t, is naturally obtained and its role is closely examined.

3. the reason why the overlap of |+ > and | > should be taken in
the anomaly calculation is manifest. the overlap in the partition
function corresponds to a dierence in the eective action.

4. this new regularization is applied to 4 dim euclidean qed and 2 dim
chiral gauge theory. especially, in the latter model, both consistent
and covariant anomalies appear depending on the choice of solutions
in the 1+4 dim dirac equation. it is a new characterization of the two
anomalies.

in sec.2 the heat-kernel method is reviewed taking 4 dim euclidean
qed as an example. in sec.3 the new regularization formalism of domain
wall approach is explained. we apply it, in sec.4, to the model of sec.2
and reproduce the result using the domain wall regularization.
in sec.5
the ultraviolet regularization of the momentum integral is closely explained.
some characteristic functions appear. the new regularization is applied to
2 dim chiral gauge theory in sec.6. the consistent and covariant anomalies
are newly characterized. in sec.7 we consider the case of massive fermion.
finally we conclude in sec.8. three appendices are in order. app.a describes
the present notation. some useful integral formulae are listed in app.b.
projective properties of free solutions ( positive and negative energy ) of 1+4
dim dirac equation are displayed in app.c.

2 qed in the heat-kernel approach

we review 4 dim euclidean qed using the heat-kernel approach and x
the present notation. the results will be compared with the domain wall
approach in the following sections. in 1951 schwinger [22] did the heat-kernel
analysis of the (1+3 dim) qed and succeeded in calculating the radiative
corrections in the covariant way. physically some interesting phenomenon of
the vacuum polarization in the strong magnetic eld was pointed out.

we consider the massless euclidean case and focus on its anomaly aspect.

the lagrangian is given by

l = i  /d ,

/d = ( + iea)

,

(i /d) = i /d .

our convention of the gamma matrices is given in app.a. the (1-loop) ef-
fective action is usually evaluated as

where d is a quadratic dierential operator and has positive (semi)denite
eigenvalues, hence the t-integral converges well. the heat kernel is introduced
as

where < x| and |y > are the x-representation of d (diracs bra- and ket-
vectors respectively) which can be well-dened by the complete set of eigen-
functions of d: {fn(x); n = 0, 1,  | dfn(x) = nfn(x)}. the boundary
condition equation in (3) shows the heat kernel regularization. the heat
equation is usually solved in perturbation around the free solution.

condition on g(x, y; t).

g(x, y; t) = 4(x  y)i4

.

(7)

we note here the following things.

1. the propagator has the form: the theta function (t)  free solution

g0(x; t).

2. the factor (t) in s(x y; t) guarantees that the system evolves in the

forward direction in the proper time t.

these properties are characteristic of the heat propagation and will be uti-
lized in the following sections. the analogy to the heat is the central idea of
this paper[20].

under the innitesimal chiral u(1) transformation:

 = i5(x) ,

  = i5(x)

,

the lagrangian (1) transforms as

under the innitesimal weyl transformation

l =  5 .

it changes as

l = i  + 2  l .

the naive ward-takahashi(wt) identities for the chiral and weyl trans-
formations are derived from (9) and (11). the deviation from the naive
wt identities, which originates from the measure change[23], is identied as
the anomaly. they are given by

using the relation (7). (e) is the 1-loop -function of qed. a useful formula
for the calculation of g(x, x; t = +0) in (12) and (13) is given in [24]. (for
the yang-mills theory, -function was obtained in this way in [25].)

3 domain wall approach

let us do the analysis of the previous section (the 4 dim massless euclidean
qed) in the domain wall approach. first we express the eective action in
terms of i( + iea) itself, not its square as in sec.2..

l =  d ,

formally we have

d = i( + iea)

,

d = d .

(15)

because the eigenvalues of d are both negative and positive, the t-integral
above is divergent. we clearly need regularization to make it meaningful. we
should notice here that the nal equality above relies only on the following
properties of d and 5:

5 d + d5 = 0 ,

(5)2 = 1

.

(16)

note that, in the nal expression of (15), the signs of the eigenvalues of d be-
come less important ( than the case of the previous section ) for the t-integral

convergence. this is because the exponetial operator et d is replaced by the
oscillating operators eit5 d due to the relation (16) 3 . here we introduce
two regularization parameters m and m, which are most characteristic in
this approach. 4

present notation.) note here that the signs of the wick-rotation is dierent

4 in a sense we generalize the relation (16) through this procedure. in order to derive
eq.(17) from eq.(15) for an innitesimally small value of m (= m), some m -dependent
terms should appear in the right hand side of the rst equation of (16).
it looks to
correspond to a kind of ginsparg-wilson relation[18].

the nal important stage is regularization of the (1-loop) ultravio-
let divergences.
(we will explain it in sec.5 in detail.) corresponding to
the 1-loop quantum evaluation, the determinant (15) nally involves one
momentum(k)-integral (besides t-integral). we will take the analytic con-
tinuation method (sect.5(ii)) in order to avoid introducing further regular-
ization parameters and to avoid breaking the gauge invariance. as will be
explained in (60) in sect.5(i), it is essentially equivalent to restricting the
integral region from 0  |k| <  to

chiral condition : 0  |k|  m .

(24)

6 the relation between 4 dim quantities(x and k) and 1+4 dim ones(x a and k a):
(x a) = (x 0, x  = x), (k a) = (k 0, k  = k), kax a = k0x 0  k x  = k0x 0 +
kx. only for 1+4 dim quantities (capital letters), the upper and lower indices have
meaning.

7 useful relations: i kx = ie(k)x 0  ikx, i kx = ie(k)x 0  ikx, m + \k =
m + e(k)5 + i /k, m  \k = m  e(k)5 + i /k.

(see sec.5.) 9 this looks similar to the usual pauli-villars procedure in the
point of ultra-violet regularization. m plays the role of the momentum cut-
o. we should stress that this restriction condition (24) on the momentum
integral, at the same time, controls the chirality as explained in the following.
( this point is a distinguished property of the domain wall regularization. )
we call (24) chiral condition. in fact, taking the extreme chiral limit:

this result will be used for characterizing dierent congurations with re-
spect to the chirality. we use (24) instead of (25) in concrete calculations.
(25) is too restrictive to keep the dynamics. loosening the extreme chiral
limit (25) to the chiral condition (24) can be regarded as a part of the present
regularization. this situation looks similar to the introduction of the wilson
term, in the lattice formalism, in order to break the chiral symmetry. (see
the last paragraph of sec.8.)

let us reexamine the condition (18). as read from the above result,
the domain is characterized by the exponetial damping behaviour which has
the width 1/m around the origin of the extra t-axis. (18) restricts the
region of t as t  1/m. this is for considering only the massless mode as
purely as possible. in the lattice formalism, this corresponds to taking the
zero mode (surface state) limit, in order to avoid the doubling problem, by

9 instead of the analytic continuation, we can take the higher derivative regularization.
this corresponds to the wilson term in lattice: i /  m  i /  r
m  2  m, r: wilson
term coecient. in this case the unitarity problem, rather than the gauge invariance,
should be claried.

introducing many avor fermions (or adding an extra dimension) and many
bosonic pauli-villars elds to kill the heavy fermions contribution. besides
the extreme chiral limit (25), we often consider , corresponding to (18), the
following limit:

the factor m +i /k

the full solutions (20).

in the lattice numerical simulation, the best t value of the regular-
ization mass m looks restricted both from the below and from the above
depending on the simulation environment [28, 16]. 10 (m a few gev for
the hadron simulation.) the similar one occurs in the present regularization.

(29)

in the standpoint of the extra dimension, the limit m  1
t (mt  +0) cor-
responds to , combined with the condition on |k|/m, taking the dimensional
reduction from 1+4 dim to 4 dim (domain wall picture of 4 dim space). in
the regularization view, this limit plays the role of the infrared regulariza-
tion. the condition |k|  m should be basically regarded as a control of
chirality as explained above. its role, from the view of regularization, is the
control of the high momentum region in the divergent momentum integral.
the relation (29) is the most characteristic one of the present regular-
it should be compared with the usual heat-kernel regularization

ization.

10 in lattice the corresponding bound on m , from the requirement of no doublers, has

been known since the original works[4, 6].

13

in (12) and (13) where only the limit t  +0 is taken and the ultravio-
let regularization is done by the simple subtraction of divergences. eq.(29)
shows the delicacy in taking the limit in the the present 1+4 dimensional
regularization scheme. it implies, in the lattice simulation, m should be ap-
propriately chosen depending on the regularization scale (,say, lattice size)
and the momentum-region of 4 dim fermions.

3.1 feynman path

in this subsection and the next, we obtain some solutions of 1+4 dim dirac
equation which are specied by (g0, s)s through the general form (20)-(21).
first we consider the feynman path (f) in fig.1. then the propagator
is given by the feynman propagator: sf (x, y ) = (x 0  y 0)gp
0(x, y ) +
(y 0  x 0)gn
0 (x, y ). it has both the retarded and advanced parts. now we
remind ourselves of the fact that there exists a xed direction in the system
evolvement when the temperature parameter works well (see the statement
around (6) and (7) in sec.2). let us regard the extra axis, after the wick-
rotations, as a temperature. assuming the analogy holds here, we try to
adopt the following solution, imitating the form of the weyl anomaly solution
(6).

0 (x, y )  sf (x, y ) (31)
this is chosen in such a way that the t-integral converges. (the opposite
choice will be considered in the last part of this subsection.) because we have
divided a full solution into two chiral parts in order to introduce a xed
direction in the system evolvement, sf above does not satisfy the proper
propagation equation (21). instead it satises the following ones:

the equations above say sf above satisfy the chiral propagator equation

(36)

the meaning of the choice of feynman path solution (30,31) is subtle
(but interesting) 11 , because the solution does not satisfy (i\  m)g5
m =
ie /ag5
m . the clear separation of right and left (fig.2) and its calculational
simplicity fascinate us to examine this solution. one purpose of this paper
is to nd whether this solution works correctly as regularization or not. (
as will be seen in the following sections, it works well except a simple factor
as far as anomalies are concerned. ) the same thing can be said about the
next paragraph.

as a nal comment of this subsection, we refer to the opposite choice
in (30) and (31). we call this choice anti-feynman path solution. if we take
the anti-feynman (f) path in fig.1, we obtain

g0(x, y ) = gn

g0(x, y ) = gp

(25).

taking the extreme chiral limit | k
m |  1 in the chosen propagator above, we
can read the domain wall structure as in fig.3. it shows the domain wall not
at the origin (t = 0) but at the innity (t = ) for each domain. the above
solutions satisfy the boundary condition:

g5m

(x, y ) (advanced)  iz

d4k

from this we obtain

the regularization using this solution turns out to give the same result as
the feynman path solution. the dierent point is that, due to the presence
of the exponetially growing factor e+e(k)t, we must do calculation in the
x 0-coordinate.[20]

3.2 symmetric path

let us consider the symmetric pathes sa and sb in fig.1. in this case we are
led to take the following solution.

s(x, y ) = (x 0  y 0)(g

+ :

g0(x, y ) = g

ssym satify the propagator equation properly,

(i\  m)ssym = 5(x  y )

,

(41)

(42)

(43)

which should be compared with sf of (32). 12 taking the extreme chiral
limit |k|
m  1 in the spectrum of the chosen propagator above, we can read
o the symmetric wall structure (one wall at the origin and the other at
the innity) as in fig.4. the above solutions satisfy the following boundary
condition:

+ (retarded)  i54(x  y) as m(x 0  y 0)  +0 ,
g5m

i

(44)

in this case, the measure change (12,13) is regularized as

 ln jabj =

12 the proper solution of (20) with the initial condition (44), which is the cauchy
problem of 1+4 dim dirac equation, is given here. note, in the present case, that the time
axis is a half line x 0 > 0 or x 0 < 0 with y 0 = 0. with this note, the results (41) and
(42) coincide with 1+4 dim version of (3.29) of [27].

the gures of fig.2,3 and 4 schematically show the present regularization
can control the chirality well because the separation between the left and the
right is the key point. both in (36) and in (45), the anomalies are expressed
by the dierence between g5m
contributions. 13 this exactly
corresponds to the overlap equation in the original formalism. the dif-
ference in the eective action corresponds to the product in the partition
function between (+) part and (-) part, that is the overlap. this is the
reason we can name g5m

+ and g5m


 as ()-domains in (17) and (19).

13 especially for the feynman path case (36), taking the dierence is indispensable to

regularize 54(x  y).

19

so far we have mainly explained the formalism of the domain wall reg-
ularization. in the following sections, we will explicitly evaluate the chiral
anomalies in 4 dim qed and 2 dim chiral gauge theory using this new domain
wall formalism. surely the known results are reproduced. this shows the cor-
rectness of the present regularization. some dierent regularizations appear
depending on the choice of solutions of the 1+4 dim massive dirac equation.
each choice has its characteristic aspect. the feynman and anti-feynman
pathes are advantageous in that the calculation is simple. especially for
the feynman path, the evaluation can be done in the original t-coordinate
(no need for wick rotation). the clear separation of left and right chirality
is also advantageous. the chiral version of the original theory , which is
non-chiral (hermitian), is automatically treated at the limit m  +. it
is disadvantageous(, at least, at present ) that the regularization relies on
the approximate solution of the dirac equation as shown in (32). on the
other hand the symmetric path is advantageous in that it relies on the proper
solution of the dirac equation as shown in (43). the conguration of two
walls (one at the origin and the other at the innity for each domain) 14 is
similar to the lattice situation. its disadvantageous point is the calculational
complexity. we must take into account both positive and negative energy
states for every propagator. we will later see, in sec.6, another important
dierence, between the above two kinds pathes, in relation to the consistent
and covariant anomalies.

4 anomalies of 4 dim euclidean qed using

domain wall regularization

in this section we explicitly evaluate chiral anomalies. in the process some
divergent integrals will appear. they correspond to the ultraviolet diver-
gences in the local eld theories. its regularization is one of key points of the
present approach and is separately examined in sec.5. only the 2-nd order
(with respect to a) perturbation contributes.

14 in lattice, the wall at the innity is often called anti-wall. this is the chiral partner
of the other at the origin in the symmetric solution. do not confuse it with the similar
terminology : the anti-feynman path in subsec.3.1.

positive (negative) energy states for (+)-domain ((-)-domain). this is one
advantageous point of the feynman path. we can obtain the same result
in the x 0-coordinate [20].
in this case, however, the momentum integral
must be regularized and we take the analytic continuation. (this is always
necessary for the anti-feynman and symmetric path.) since it is one of
important points of the present regularization, we explain it separately in
the next section.

16 the discrepant factor 1/4 comes from the fact that the feynman path is not the
proper solution as commented in subsec.3.1.
if we allowed to consider in the extreme
chiral limit, hoping that the chiral anomaly itself is a topological object and does not
depend on the continuous parameter m , we can explain the factor as follows. for each
vertex, instead of /a = 1+5
/a, we consider half of it ( the right-part for feynman
). therefore ( 1

the weyl anomaly can be evaluated using the second equation of (36)
(feynman) or (45) (symmetric) in the similar way above. in this case we
need to consider the parity-even terms instead of the odd ones (5 terms)
in the trace. we also need to take into account aa-terms besides (a)2-
terms. it is one of the present advantage that both weyl and chiral anomalies
can be treated in a common framework. details have been found in [33].

5 regularization of momentum integral

as shown in the cut-o parameter m (24), the regularization in the momen-
tum integral is one of most important points in the present approach. on
the one hand the explanation about the chiral condition can be clearly stated
in terms of the cuto parameter m as we have done in sect.3. from this
viewpoint, the present regularization is explained in (i) part of the following.
on the other hand we cannot explicitly introduce the cuto parameter m in
the momentum integral because it breaks the gauge invariance. the present
regularization is re-examined in (ii) from this viewpoint. ( another possible
regularization is the higher-derivative one, which corresponds to the wilson
term as commented in a footnote of (24).
) we take two characteristic

cos(ax2 + 1) = z 

fs(a)  z 
fc(a)  z 
(58)
where a > 0 , y = x2 + 1 and x appears, in the concrete calculation, as
x = kk/m (k : momentum in the 4 dim euclidean space; m : 1+4 dim
fermion mass). in terms of the notations in app.b, these two integrals are

(ii) analytical continuation

instead of (i) we can do the same thing by the analytic continuation,

which donot need to introduce an additional regularization parameter. we
start with a convergent integral :

the present regularization, in the momentum integral, typically do the
following things: 1) (exponetially) divergent functions, due to negative
eigenvalues, are rst replaced by oscillating ones (fig.7, above) using the
wick rotation (x 0 = it) and then 2) the large momentum (|k|  m)
region is made to be exponentially damped (fig.7, below) by the -factor
(or the analytic continuation, or the chiral condition (24)). finally we take
3) the limit mt  +0 or mx 0  0. steps 1) and 2) are for ultra-violet
regularization whereas 3) is for infrared one.

6 2 dim non-abelian anomaly

let us consider 2 dim chiral non-abelian gauge theory and analyze its
anomaly in the present domain wall approach. its consistent and covariant
anomalies were examined in the ordinary heat-kernel by [29, 30] and in the
ordinary domain wall approach by [6, 10, 31].

the jacobian for the change of variables (,   , ) is given by

we notice the existence of dierent choices for the present regularization.
see fig.8. among them we consider two representative ones which
correspond to the consistent and covariant anomalies.

in the lattice approach, the superiority of the domain wall fermion (to

the ordinary wilson fermion) is no need to ne-tune the hopping parameter
which suers from the renormalization due to the gauge interaction. in
addition to the wave-function and coupling renormalizations, the mass
renormalization is one crucial test of the superiority. we can calculate such
an eect using the above formulae. the full consideration can be done only
after the fermion and the gauge elds are treated on the equal footing. it
has recently been performed in [33].

8 conclusion and discussion

inspired by the recent progress of the chiral fermion on lattice, we have
presented a new regularization, for the continuum euclidean eld theories,
which is based on the domain wall conguration in one dimension higher
(minkowski) space. we have veried the analogous aspect to the lattice
case, such as the domain wall structure, the condition on the 1+4 dim
dirac mass (the regularization parameter m), the overlap dirac operator,
etc. applying the proposed regularization to some models (4 dim qed, 2
dim chiral gauge theory), the known anomalies are correctly reproduced. it
shows the present regularization correctly works.

comparing fig.2 (or 3) with fig.4, we can imagine that the choice of
(anti-)feynman path solution perturbatively denes the chiral version of
the original theory, for example, the chiral gauge theory. as far as anomaly
calculation is concerned, it holds true. in order to show the statement
denitely, we must clarify the following things. the ordinary chiral
symmetry appears only in the limit : |k|

m  +0, as shown in (33). but this
e , a), the theory looks like the 1+4
e ). in the lattice approach, however, such an

39

limit can not be taken because it freezes the dynamics and anomalies do
not appear. it seems we must introduce some new softened version of the
chiral symmetry which keeps the dynamics. one standpoint taken in this
paper is to replace |k|/m  1 by |k|/m  1 in (33). it breaks the
ordinary chiral symmetry. it could, however, be possible that this
replacement can avoid the breaking by changing (generalizing) the
ordinary chiral symmetry. in this case, the new chiral lagrangian has
innitely many higher-derivative terms. we should explain this new
deformed lagrangian from some generalized chiral symmetry. this
situation looks similar to what lusher[19] did for the chiral lattice.

the present regularization is characterized by the introduction of the

fth coordinate t, and the regularization mass m. the limit (29) is quite
impressive as a new regularization. because we are , in this article, mainly
concerned with anomalies, the analysis need not to touch upon the
t-integral. (we examine only the variation of the partition function under
the chiral transformation, or the measure change. we do not examine the
partition function itself. ) for the evaluation of the partition function, we
know t-integral is usually regularized as

  t  t (

t

)

,

t
  1 ,

(91)

where another two regularization parameters (ultraviolet) and t (infrared)
appear. the consistency with (29) requires

m

.

(92)

the full treatment of the partition function has been consistently done in a
recent work[33], where the renormalization is formulated with the care for
the quantum eect of both fermions and gauge bosns.

we stress characteristic points of the present domain wall regularization.

 the higher dimensional dirac eld mass m is the only regularization
parameter used in this paper. it should satisfy the condition (29) in
order to do the following role: 1) controlling the chirality, 2) forming
the domain wall conguration (dimensional reduction), 3) ultraviolet
and infrared regularization for the momentum integral.

40

 there appears dierent regularizations depending on the solutions of

the higher dim dirac equation. the feynman path is (practically)
appropriate for the analysis of chiral properties, although overall
factors of anomalies deviate from the right ones. the calculation is
most simple. whereas the symmetric path gives the proper solution
of the dirac equation and the regularization with the path gives the
correct anomaly including the coecient. especially the covariant
anomaly is obtained only by the choice of the symmetric path and the
hermitian vertex. other choices essentially lead to the consistent
anomaly.

 the characteristic functions appearing in the present regularization,
such as the incomplete gamma function, indicate the advance over
other ordinary regularizations, say, the dimensional one where only
the gamma function appears.

the chiral problem itself does not depend on the interaction. it looks a

kinematical problem in the quantization of elds. how do we treat the
dierent propagations of free solutions depending on the boundary
conditions (with respect to the wick-rotated time) is crucial to the
problem. in the standpoint of the operator formalism (the fock-space
formalism) it corresponds to how to treat the delicate structure (due to
the ambiguity of the fermion mass sign) of the vacuum of the free fermion
theory. the present paper insists the following prescription: first we go to
1+4 dim minkowski space by the wick-rotation of the inverse temperature
t, and take the directed solution as in sect.3. the anomaly phenomena
concretely reveal the chiral problem. the proposed prescription passes the
anomaly test.

the recent progress in the lattice formalism, using the neubergers

overlap dirac operator[17] and luschers chiral symmetry on lattice[19], has
revealed the importance of the condition on m, where the anomaly
coecient varies depending on the dierent conditions on m. m is
bounded by the wilson parameter in some ways[34, 35, 36, 37]. it shows
whether the zero mode (surface state) is correctly picked up in the
regularization crucially depends on the choice of m. note that there is not
the wilson term in the present formalism. even such case we have the
similar condition (29) which produces the correct coecient. this strongly

41

implies the present regularization eectively does the same thing as the
wilson term does in the lattice formalism.

appendix a. notations

in the analysis of the chiral property, much care should be paid to 1 and
i. the physical interpretation of the nal result heavily relies on such
delicacy. in this circumstance, we decide to present the present notation in
this appendix. we adopt the convention of ref.[7] for the gamma matrices

appendix c. projective properties of (k)

e(k) = k2 + m 2, ( k a) = (e(k), k  = k), ( k a) = (e(k),k  = k).

k is the momentum in the 4 dim euclidean space. k and k are on-shell
