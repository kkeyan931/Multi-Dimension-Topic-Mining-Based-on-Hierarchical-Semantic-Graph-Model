we consider a model for tensionless (null) p-branes with n = 1 global supersym-
metry in 10-dimensional minkowski space-time. we give an action for the model
and show that it is reparametrization and kappa-invariant. we also nd some solu-
tions of the classical equations of motion. in the case of null superstring (p = 1),
we obtain the general solution in arbitrary gauge.

1 introduction

the null p-branes are the zero tension limit of the tensionful ones. the
correspondence between this two types of branes may be regarded as a generalization
of the massless-massive particles relationship. null branes with manifest space-
time or world-volume supersymmetry are considered in [1] and [2] respectively. in
a previous paper [3], we began the investigation of a tensionless p-brane model
with n = 1 supersymmetry in ten dimensional at space-time. starting with a
hamiltonian which is a linear combination of rst and mixed (rst and second)
class constraints, we succeed to obtain a new one, which is a linear combination
of rst class, bfv-irreducible and lorentz-covariant constraints only. this was
done with the help of the introduced auxiliary harmonic variables [4], [5]. then we
gave manifest expressions for the classical brst charge, the corresponding total
constraints and brst-invariant hamiltonian.

in this letter, we continue the investigation of the model. here, we consider the
corresponding action, establish its symmetries, and present some solutions of the
classical equations of motion.

our initial hamiltonian is [3]

h0 = z dp[0t0 + jtj + d],

(1)

where the constraints t0, tj and d are dened by the equalities:

t0 = pp,
tj = pjx + pj,
d = ip  (6 p)

diag() = (, +, ..., +),

j = /j ,
6 p = p
,

(,  = 0, 1, ..., 9),

(j = 1, 2, ..., p),
( = 1, 2, .., 16).

here (x, ) are the superspace coordinates, (p, p) are their canonically conju-
gated momenta,  is a left majorana-weyl space-time spinor, and  are the ten
dimensional pauli matrices (our spinor conventions are as in [3]). the hamiltonian
(1) is a generalization of the hamiltonians for the bosonic null p-brane and for the
n = 1 brink-schwarz superparticle.

2 solutions of the equations of motion

the equations of motion which follow from the hamiltonian h0 are ( =

/ ):

(  jj)x = 20p  (),
(  jj)p = (jj)p,
(  jj) = i,
(  jj)p = (jj)p + ( 6 p).

(2)

in (2), one can consider 0, j and  as depending only on  = (1, ..., p) but not
on  (this is a consequence from their equations of motion).

in the gauge when 0, j and  are constants, the general solution of (2) is

x(, ) = x(z) +  [20p(z)  ((, ))],

= x(z) +  [20p(z)  ((z))]

p(, ) = p(z),
(, ) = (z) + i ,
p(, ) = p(z) +  ()p(z),

(3)

where x(z), p(z), (z) and p(z) are arbitrary functions of their arguments

zj = j + j.

in the case of tensionless strings (p = 1), one can write explicitly the general
solution of the equations of motion in arbitrary gauge: 0 = 0(), 1   = (),

2

 = (). this solution is given by

x(, ) = g(w)  2



z 0(s)

2(s)

dsf (w) +



z (s)

(s)

ds[(w)]



z ds1

p(, ) = 1()f(w),


z (s)
(, ) =  (w)  i
p(, ) = 1()"h(w) 

(s)

z ()(s)

(s)

dsf(w)#.

here g(w), f(w),  (w) and h(w) are arbitrary functions of the variable

w =  +



z

ds
(s)

when p = 1, the solution (3) diers from (4) by the choice of the particular
solutions of the inhomogenious equations. as for z and w, one can write for example
(0, ,  are now constants)

p(, ) = 1f( + /) = 1f[1( + )] = p(z)

and analogously for the other arbitrary functions in the general solution of the
equations of motion.

3 lagrangian formulation

taking into account the equations of motion for x and , one obtains the

corresponding lagrangian density

l =

1

40h(  jj)x + i(  jj)i2

.

indeed, one veries that the equations of motion for the lagrange multipliers 0
and j give the constraints t0 and tj. the remaining constraints follow from the
denition of the momenta p.

to establish the invariances of the action, it is useful to rewrite l in the form

l = v j v ky 

j yk

,

(j, k = 0, 1, ..., p),

where

v j = (v 0, v j) =  

1

20 ,

j

20!

3

and

then, the action

j = j x + i(j ).
y 

s = z dp+1v j v ky 

j yk

,

j = ( 0, j) = (, ),

has global super-poincar`e symmetry, local world-volume reparametrization and -
invariances. let us show that this is indeed the case. before doing this, we note
that actions of this type are rst given in [6] for the case of tensionless superstring
(p = 1) and in [7] for the bosonic case (n = 0).

the global poincar`e invariance is obvious. under global innitesimal supersym-

metry transformations, the elds x(), () and v j () transform as follows

 = 

,

x = i()

,

v j = 0.

as a consequence, y 

j = 0 and hence l = s = 0 also.

to establish the invariance of the action under innitesimal dieomorphisms,
we rst write down the corresponding transformation law for the (r,s)-type tensor
density of weight a

t j1...jr

k1...ks[a] = lt j1...jr

k1...ks[a] = llt j1...jr

k1...ks[a]

+ t j1...jr
 t j j2...jr
+ at j1...jr

kk2...ks[a]k1k + ... + t j1...jr
k1...ks [a]j j1  ...  t j1...jr1j
k1...ks[a]ll,

k1...ks

[a]j jr

k1...ks1k[a]ksk

(5)

where l is the lie derivative along the vector eld . using (5), one veries that
if x(), () are world-volume scalars (a = 0) and v j () is a world-volume (1,0)-
type tensor density of weight a = 1/2, then y 
j yk is a
(0,2)-type tensor and l is a scalar density of weight a = 1. so,

j is a (0,1)-type tensor, y 

s = z dp+1j (jl)

and the variation s of the action vanishes under suitable boundary conditions.

let us now check the kappa-invariance. we dene the - variations of (),

x() and v j () as follows:

 = i() = iv j (6 yj ),
x = i(),
v k = 2v kv l(l).

(6)

therefore, () is a left majorana-weyl space-time spinor and world-volume scalar
density of weight a = 1/2.

from (6) we obtain:

(y 

j yk) = 2i[j  6 yk + k 6 yj ]

4

and

l = 2v j y 

j yk[v k  2v kv l(l)] = 0.

the algebra of kappa-transformations closes only on the equations of motion,

which can be written in the form:

j (v j v kyk) = 0,
v j v k(j  6 yk) = 0,
j yk = 0.

v j y 

(7)

as usual, an additional local bosonic world-volume symmetry is needed for its clo-
sure. in our case, the lagrangian, and therefore the action, are invariant under the
following transformations of the elds:

() = v j j 

,

x() = i()

,

v j() = 0.

now, checking the commutator of two kappa-transformations, we nd:

[1, 2]() = () + terms  eqs. of motion,
[1, 2]x() = ( +  + )x() + terms  eqs. of motion,
[1, 2]v j () = v j () + terms  eqs. of motion.

here (), () and () are given by the expressions:

 = 2v k[(k1)

 = 4iv k(1 6 yk2)

2  (k2)
1 ],
j = v j .

,

we stress that

in (6) has the following property on the equations of motion

 = (v j 6 yj )

2 = 0.

this means that the kappa-invariance of the action indeed halves the fermionic
degrees of freedom as is needed.

finally, we give the expression for world-volume stress-energy tensor

t j
k = (2v j y 

k  j

kv ly 

l )v m ym 

from (7) and (8) it is clear, that

t j

k = 0

,

t r(t ) = (1  p)l.

(8)

(9)

on the equations of motion. it is natural, because the equality (9) is a consequence
of p + 1 of the constraints.

4 conclusions

in this letter we consider a model for tensionless (null) p-branes with n = 1
global supersymmetry in 10-dimensional minkowski space-time. we give an action
for the model and show that it is reparametrization and kappa-invariant. as usual,
the algebra of kappa-transformations closes only on-shell and it halves the fermionic
degrees of freedom. in proving the kappa-invariance, we do not use any specic ten
dimensional properties of the spinors. hence, the model is extendable classically to
other space-time dimensions. there exist also the possibility of its generalization to
n supersymmetries [8]. the properties of the model in nontrivial backgrounds are
also under investigation [9].

in this letter we also nd some solutions of the classical equations of motion.
in the case of null superstring (p = 1), we obtain the general solution in arbitrary
gauge.
