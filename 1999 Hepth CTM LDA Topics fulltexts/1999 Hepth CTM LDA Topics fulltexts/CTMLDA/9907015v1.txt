the correspondence between the t hooft limit of n = 4 super yang-mills theory
and tree-level iib superstring theory on ads5s5 in a ramond-ramond background
at values of  = g2n ranging from innity to zero is examined in the context of
unitarity. a squaring relation for the imaginary part of the holographic scattering of
identical string elds in the two-particle channels is found, and a mismatch between
weak and strong t hooft coupling is pointed out within the correspondence. several
interpretations and implications are proposed.

1 introduction

recently there has been much interest in understanding the t hooft limit of n = 4
super yang-mills theory at strong coupling via the conjectured correspondence with
iib superstring theory compactied on ads5  s5 in a non-vanishing ramond-
ramond background [1, 2, 3, 4]. despite the developments in technology useful in
computing correlation functions at large  through the classical holographic super-
gravity description, there has been little work on interpolating correlation functions
beyond three-point between the two regimes. as the four-point functions are known
not to correspond to the free-eld limit at large coupling, this would involve resum-
ming an innite set of planar feynman diagrams and comparing with the scattering
element derived from the innite number of string exchanges in tree-level string
theory.

both these calculations appear hard in that summing an innite number of feyn-
man diagrams seems intractable, while the techniques of perturbative string theory
on ads5  s5 in a ramond-ramond background have not been fully developed;
progress along the direction in [5, 6] would be needed. the general four-point func-
tion at string tree level in the anti-de sitter (rr) background is a function f (, ki)
of the t hooft coupling . at large n and nite  = g2n, scattering elements
obey a factorization condition inherited from the classical eld equations [7]; for
those between identical elds the factorization condition may be used to obtain a
non-negativity condition on the imaginary part of four-point functions in the two-
particle channels. on the other hand, the result at  = 0 in n = 4 super yang-mills
theory for these dual correlators is easily computable at four-point (in x-space as
well as in k-space). we shall combine these two calculations in the dierent limits
to probe the conjectured correspondence at nite t hooft coupling and at large n.
extending the weakly coupled string theory calculation to the regime of strong
coupling may invalidate the classical approximation (the anti-de sitter space is pre-
served under quantum corrections to leading order corrections in the iib eective
action given in [8]). however, it is of interest to nd potential properties of iib
holographic string theory on ads that may lift to the dual boundary eld theory
in the intermediate coupling regime (i.e.   1). there are several forms of the
conjectured correspondence between iib string theory on ads5s5 in a background
rr eld and n = 4 super yang-mills theory; we note beforehand that further non-
perturbative processes are in accord with summing over dierent asymptotically
ads spacetimes. our intention here is to examine the holographic scattering in the
spirit of the gross-mende eect [9] (limiting to a tensionless r2/  0 string).

rather than computing the scattering element on ads5  s5 in a constant
ramond-ramond background, we shall use a unitarity argument to nd a posi-
tivity condition on the imaginary part in the two-particle channel for particular
correlator examples where all of the external elds are of the same type. we assume

1

j . holding k2

we dene s = s12, t = s23 and u = s13; then s+t+u = p k2

that unitarity is sensible in the bulk theory, and we use the i prescription provided
in [7], following from the naive wick rotation of the euclidean geometry. (see [10]
and [11] for a detailed account of the i in critical and compactied four-point string
amplitudes.) unitarity has been examined in detail in [12, 7, 13]. in the following,
j  0 together
with t, u < 0 and s > 0 we extract the imaginary parts in the s-channel by complex
conjugation [7]. in conventional perturbative string theory on a curved space at any
nite value of the s value only a nite number of kaluza-klein and string states
may contribute to the spectral density, and hence to the imaginary parts at nite s.
in the holographic formulation an innite number of string modes contribute to the
imaginary parts. the analysis performed here relies only on the existence of eld
equations for the modes of the string on the compactied space, thus avoiding the
technical complications associated with a path integral quantization. we further
assume that a consistent truncation exists for the eld equations coming from the
compactied string theory; evidence for this has been found in related supergravity
theories in [14]; although this has not been shown technically in the case at hand,
we shall assume that it exists.

the cut in the s-channel, if we choose the external lines to be of the same particle

type, is of the form

imsaf f f f (kj) = xi

mi(k1, k2; k1 + k2)mi(k3, k4; k3 + k4) ,

(1.1)

after integrating over the bulk (fth) holographic coordinate perpindicular to the
boundary. the sum over i extends over all contributing intermediate states in the
particular holographic four-point function. we now further examine the scalar con-
tributions. the factorization condition follows from decomposing the bulk-bulk
propagator through the relation

g(x, y) = xn



n(x)n(y)
2
n  i

,

(1.2)

where n(x) span a complete set of eigenfunction solutions of the kinetic operator
(with appropriate boundary conditions) for the particular eld we are considering.
for example, the propagator for massive scalar elds has the form after a wick
rotation (in minkowski anti-de sitter poincare coordinates ds2 = 1/x2
0 + d~x2)
where we have the boundary four-dimensional metric given by u  v = u0v0  ~u  ~v),

where  = qm2 + d2/4 > 0. in poincare coordinates (x) are labelled by the four-
vector ~k, the conserved momentum along the boundary, and a continous eigenvalue
. the i prescription is chosen to agree with that on the boundary n = 4 super
yang-mills theory via a wick rotation. the result for the correlation function will be
proportional to a factor of i, both in the string theory and in the boundary theory;
as we are exploring the analytic properties of the correlation function we shall drop
the factor of i in (1.3) as well as in the four-point function.

further modications of the greens functions in minkowski space via adding
normalizable zero modes to them [12, 15] will not alter the factorization of the
general four-point function, but rather change the functional form of mi in (1.1) by
the addition of terms to the propagators. although we have reproduced the explicit
form of the massive propagator in (1.3), the factorization condition found from the
complete set of states in (1.2) is expected to hold for general elds with spin as does
in perturbative string theory.

holding k2 < 0 in (1.3) extracts the imaginary part within the k-integration (via
im(2  ~k2  i)1 = (d)(2  ~k2)) for the propagating modes in the interior
of the anti-de sitter spacetime. this imaginary part reproduces the factorization
formula in (1.1).

note that, for an arbitrarily massive mode, the imaginary part picks up a con-
tribution from a small negative value of k2, as is clear from (1.3) and (1.6). each
term in the sum in (1.1) gives rise to a power series expansion in , from expanding
the mass dependence in the integrals over the bulk-boundary-boundary three-point
functions (the argument of the bessel function depends on the mass). the fact that
an innite number of states contribute to the unitarity cut at nite s is a holographic
feature diering from usual perturbative string theory; the latter gives contributions
in accord with particle thresholds; i.e. 1/k2  m2 + i in propagating states. how-
ever, at nite , where one is eectively extending the analysis on the eld theory
side to an innite number of feynman diagrams, this is in accord with extracting
unitarity cuts in two-particle channels of multi-loop feynman diagrams of arbitrary
loop order.
in each order within a loop expansion in perturbation theory of the
correlation function, one expects a contribution of multi-particle cuts in the two-
particle channel (for example, the double-box feynman diagram contributes both

3

two- and three-particle cuts). this holographic unitarity feature appears to accord
with expectations from eld theory although the positivity condition is not clear in
eld theory.

this factorization of the holographic s-matrix elements at tree-level was noted
in [7], and follows from the fact that there is no multi-body phase space integration
to be carried out at string tree-level on the anti-de sitter space: it is a property of
the classical string description of the large n limit of the gauge theory. unitarity
restricts the functions mi to be real. holding k1 = k4 and k2 = k3 we sum over all
terms contributing on the right-hand side of the sum; each term contributes a square
of a real function and thus must be positive (strictly, non-negative). however, we
must be concerned with the presence of an innite number of terms. for any nite
number of terms the sum must be positive for any nite (positive) value of s. if the
sum becomes negative after taking into account the innite number of terms, then
a pole or cut is evidenced, reecting a nite radius of convergence.

the non-negativity condition does not depend on the detailed form of string
perturbation theory in a ramond-ramond background, but rather on the use of
eld equations in a ramond-ramond background. we should note that bulk four-
point vertices contribute to the imaginary parts at exceptional values of momenta
for the massless elds, as at s = 0, but this limit does not enter into this analysis.
we now compare with the eld theory predictions arising at the free limit, i.e.
 = 0. we normalize the protected gauge invariant operators, tr(ii . . . ik)(z),
where the so(6) vectors i are the n = 4 scalars in the adjoint representation of
su(n), in the form,

o(z) =

n

(g2n)k/2 tr (ii . . . ik)(z) ,

(1.7)

so that the free-eld limit is independent of  and proportional to n 2; the lagrangian
has the microscopic elds suitably scaled to agree with the factor n 2 of correlators
of the gauge invariant composite operators in the free-eld approximation. we are
only considering the symmetrized traceless tensor product of scalar elds i(z) for
simplicity.

in this normalization, the free-eld result for the four-point function of symmetric
bi-linear operators o(z) = 1
g2 tr(ij)(z) is explicitly in x-space the box diagram and
is proportional to n 2. in four dimensions, we have for the (unrenormalized) result,

correlators in x-space.

we choose to obtain the result in k-space, where we may compare with previous
results. after taking the fourier transform, and for external momenta satisfying
k2
j = 0, we obtain the following expression for the box diagram [16], with ordering
of momenta at the vertices k1 . . . k4,

where, in including the appropriate i, we have to change sij  sij + i. the
normalization in (1.12) explicitly has a factor of i to account for the removal of i
in the dual string theory calculation (1.6). the dimension dependent constant c()

note that by analytic continuation from higher than four dimensions the box dia-
gram evaluated at zero momentum is formally zero, i.e. i (ki = 0) = 0. we have
also regulated the above integral using dimensional reduction, where d = 4  2;
holding  < 0 regulates the infra-red divergences appearing within the above inte-
gration. the integral is ultra-violet nite but keeping  > 0 would have regulated
this occurence in any case. the complete expression for the four-point correlator in
the free-eld limit of bi-linear operators is the permuted sum of the integrals, i.e.
i(s, t) + i(s, u) + i(t, u).

the expansion in  of the particular (infra-red divergent) integral in (1.11) is

the imaginary parts in the two-particle channels may be extracted from the ex-
panded form in (1.14) via complex conjugation.

to end our discussion of the box integrations we give the most general case,
which would hold for non-exceptional values of external momenta. the result for
general momenta k2
j  0 is more complicated, but may be written down in terms of
known functions as [16]

this box integral becomes infra-red divergent when we take any k2
j  0: soft for
individual null momenta, and collinear for any two momenta owing into adjacent
vertices becoming null. if we maintain the dimensionally regularized form, keeping
the full  dependence of the above (not shown), then the preceeding box integral
follows.

we now nd the imaginary parts in the correlation functions in the free-eld
limit arising from the three contributing permuted box diagrams. holding s > 0
and t, u < 0, together with k2

j  0, we obtain for the imaginary part,

imsi(s, t) = n 2

the preceeding calculation in the tree-level iib superstring theory on ads5  s5
in a ramond-ramond background always gave a positive value. in the case of ex-
ternal string states in our amplitude calculation only internal propagating string
modes contribute, but the analysis may be performed for general four-point correla-
tion functions. the calculation of the imaginary parts arising from the string modes
in the ads space translates into evaluating the large n, nite , imaginary part of
the holographic s-matrix element.

a conundrum arises when we compare between the large  and small  regimes.
from explicitly evaluating the two dierent integrals we conclude that the imaginary
part must pass through zero, or becomes zero at the value  = 0 within dimensional
regularization. dene this critical value of the coupling as 0(kj). at a nite value of
the coupling, such as 0, only the positive functions, the squares in (1.1), contribute.
this mismatch indicates a nite radius of convergence of the perturbative series
dened either by the n = 4 eld theory at large n, or at holographic string tree-
level. hence naively the two regions do not agree with eachother.1

there are several options to account for this disagreement: (1) there is a phase
transition at nite  and at large n in the dual theory to iib superstring theory
reecting the divergence of the tree-level holographic scattering element (related to
[24]); (2) related is that the series at innite n has a nite radius of convergence
in 1/ from  large: there is either a pole on the positive real axis of  or a cut
passing through or laying on top of it (possibly also in a borel transform reecting a
nite radius of convergence); (3) unitarity is not preserved in the holographic ads
formulation; (4) there are modications yet to be specied in the matching between
n = 4 super yang-mills theory and iib superstring theory on ads5  s5 at nite
, away from  = .
instanton-like eects may be predicted in the case of option (1) or (2) similar
to the e1/gs eects predicted in the analysis of large orders of perturbative string
theory to restore convergence;
likewise, within the correspondence we may infer
similar contributions missed in n = 4 super yang-mills theory which, unlike the t
hooft instanton, contribute in the innite n limit and are not easily seen with the
use of eld equations. (it is interesting that in unbroken n = 4 super yang-mills
theory the bps mass formula indicates an innite number of massless dyons in the
theory.) the existence of further contributions is supported by the evidence for nite
radii of convergence in perturbative expansions in the large n limit [25] and evidence
for potential non-borel summability in various eld theories. if present, these eects
would deserve dual ads descriptions possibly via the inclusion of additional states

1it is possible that this comparison between the eld theory and string theory is regularization
dependent, but the string theory obeys the factorization in (1.1) also in the radial coordinate
regulating scheme z0 > rc in addition with dimensional reduction. the two types of delta function
terms, those proportional to nite or innite coecients [21], are not encountered directly here
because we are working in momentum space and have not examined possible ads boundary term
eects.

or processes within the string theory side (and contributing at intermediate coupling
in ). similar behavior is found in the context of perturbative string theory [22, 23]
and transitions have been argued for in n = 4 super yang-mills theory at nite
temperature [26]. additional modications would have to leave the two- and three-
point functions of chiral primary operators unchanged at leading order in n to
maintain the validity of previous work regarding the matching [17, 18, 19, 20].

another option is that the higher-order terms in the  expansion of the non-
abelian dirac-born-infeld action are to be included in the super yang-mills theory
description. this option would suggest that n = 4 super yang-mills theory is only
dual to iib string theory on ads at  = . sub-leading eects would necessi-
tate these higher order terms in the dbi expansion. however, this possibility is
problematic in that the dbi action is non-renormalizable in four dimensions and
further inclusion of terms might alter the two- and three-point correlation functions
at sub-leading order.

while this work was being completed, an analysis of the eects of nite radii of
convergence in an ads/cft correspondence have been presented in the context of
non-supersymmetric type 0b theory [27].
