introduction

the main purpose of this work is to make use of product integrals to give two unam-
biguous proofs of the non-abelian version of stokes theorem. the product integral
formalism has been used extensively in the theory of dierential equations and of
matrix valued functions [1]. in the latter context, it has a built-in feature for keep-
ing track of the order of the matrix valued functions involved. as a result, prod-
uct integrals are ideally suited for the description of path ordered quantities such as
holonomies. moreover, since the theory is well developed independently of particular
applications, we can be condent that the properties of such path ordered quantites
which we establish using this method are correct and unambiguous.

among the important advantages of the product integral representation of the
path dependent exponential of a matrix valued function is that in such a framework
the banach space structure of the corresponding matrix valued functions is already

built into the formalism. in particular, for a closed path eclosing an orientable 2-
surface, this will permit a surface representation of such operators. based on the
central role of stokes theorem in physics and in mathematics, it is not surprising that
the non-abelian version of this theorem has attracted a good deal of attention in the
physics literature [2]- [12]. the central features of the earlier attempts[2]- [8] have
been reviewed and improved upon in a recent work [9]. other recent works on non-
abelian stokes theorem [10, 11, 12] focus on specic problems such as connement [11],
zig-zag symmetry [12] suggested by polyakov [13], etc. with one exception [9], the
authors of these works seem to have been unaware of a 1927 work in the mathematical
literature by schlessinger [14], which bears strongly on the content of this theorem.
schlesingers work dealt with integrals of matrix valued functions and their ordering
problems. this amounts to establishing the non-abelian stokes theorem in two (target
space) dimensions. by an appropriate extension and reinterpretation of his results,
we show using the product integral approach that this theorem is valid in any target
space dimension.

this work is organized as follows: to make this manuscript self-contained, we
review in section ii the main features of product integration [1] and state without
proof a number of theorems which will be used in the proof of the non-abelian stokes
theorem.
in section iii, we deal with path ordered exponentials of matrix valued
fuctions which can be expressed as product integrals and turn to the proof of the
non-abelian stokes theorem for orientable surfaces. in section iv, we give a variant
of this proof. in section v, we explicitly demonstrate the gauge covariance of the
results obtained in sections iii and iv. finally, section is devoted to some additional
remarks.

ii some properties of product integrals

one of the initial motivations for the introduction of product integrals was [1] to solve
dierential equations of the type

y (s) = a(s)y (s).

(1)

in this expression, y (s) is an n-dimensional vector, a(s) is a matrix valued function,
and prime indicates dierentiation. so, for two real numbers a and b, the problem
is to obtain y (b) given y (a). to deal with this problem, we make a partition p =
{s0, s1, . . . , sn} of the interval [a, b]. let sk = sk  sk1 for k = 1, . . . , n, and set
a = s0, b = sn. then, solving the dierential equation in each subinterval, we can
write approximately [1]

y (b) 

n

yk=1

ea(sk)sky (a)  p(a)y (a).

(2)

2

since a(s) is matrix valued, the order in this product is important. let (p ) be the
length of the longest sk in the partition p . then, as (p )  0, we get

y (b) = lim

(p )0

p (a)y (a).

(3)

the limit is clearly valid for all y (a).

the limit of the ordered product on the right hand side of eq.(3) is the funda-
mental expression in the denition of a product integral [1]. it is formally dened, in
an obvious notation, as

x

ya

ea(s)ds = lim

(p )0

p (a)  f (x, a).

it is easy to see that f (x, a) satises the dierential equation

d
dx

f (x, a) = a(x)f (x, a)

with f (a, a) = 1. the corresponding integral equation is

f (x, a) = 1 +z x

a

ds a(s)f (s, a).

(4)

(5)

(6)

clearly, f (a, a) = 1, and f (x, a) is unique.

consider now some of the properties of the product integral matrices. for each

x[a, b] the product integral is non-singular, and its determinant is given by

det  x
ya

ea(s)ds! = er x

a

tra(s)ds.

(7)

in analogy with the additive property of ordinary integrals, product integrals have
the multiplicative property, or the composition rule,

ea(s)ds =

x

yz

ea(s)ds

x

yy

y

yz

ea(s)ds.

(8)

where x, y, z[a, b] and z  y  x. the result is independent of the choice of y and
any further decomposition of the products on the right hand side.

derivatives with respect to the end points are given by

and

ya

one of the fundamental features associated with a connection is the notion of parallel
transport. to see how it can be formulated in product integral formalism, consider
a map p : [a, b]  cnn, which is continuously dierentiable. then p (x) is an
indenite product integral if for a given a(s)

x

p (x) =

ea(s)dsp (a).

(11)

next, we dene an operation known as l operation which is like the logarithmic

derivative operation on non-singular functions. let

where prime indicates dierentiation. then, from eq. (11) it follows that

lp (x) = p (x)p 1(x),

(12)

. one of the byproducts of this operation is that

(lp )(x) = a(x)

l(p q)(x) = lp (x) + p (x)(lq(x))p 1(x).

(13)

the l operation is a crucial ingredient in establishing the analog of the fundamental
theorem of calculus for product integrals. with the map p as dened above, this
theorem states that

x

e(lp )(s)ds = p (x)p 1(a).

(14)

ya

from the results given above, it follows that p is a solution of the initial value problem

p (x) = (lp )(x)p (x).

(15)

with the unique solution given by eq. (11), this establishes the fundamental theorem
of product integration. just as in ordinary integration, the knowledge of simple
product integrals can be used to evaluate more complicated product integrals. for
example, one can prove the sum rule for product integrals:

x

x

e[a(s)+b(s)]ds = p (x)

ep 1(s)b(s)p (s)ds.

(16)

finally, we state two other important properties of product integrals which will be
used in the sequel. one is the similarity theorem which states that

x

x

p (x)

eb(s)dsp 1(a) =

e[lp (s)+p (s)b(s)p 1(s)]ds.

ya

ya

the other property is dierentiation with respect to a parameter. let

(17)

(18)

ya

ya

x

yy

p (x, y; ) =

ea(s;)ds,

where  is a parameter. then the dierentiation rule with respect to this parameter
is given by

a(s; )p (s, y; ).

(19)




p (x, y; ) = z x

iii the non-abelian stokes theorem

to provide the background for using the product integral formalism of section ii to
prove the non-abelian stokes theorem, we begin with a statement of the problem as
it arises in a physical context. let m be an n-dimensional manifold representing
the space-time (target space). let a be a (connection) 1-form on m. when m is a
dierentiable manifold, we can choose a local basis dx,  = 1, ..., n, and express a
in terms of its components:

a(x) = a(x) dx.

we take a to have values in the lie-algebra, or a representation thereof, of a lie
group. then, with tk, k = 1, .., m, representing the generators of the lie group, the
components of a can be written as

a(x) = ak

(x) tk.

with these preliminaries, we can express the path ordered phase factor of the non-
abelian gauge theories [15, 16, 17, 18] in the form

where p indicates path ordering, and c is a path in m. when the path c is closed,
the corresponding holonomy operator becomes:

wab(c) = per b

a

a.

w (c) = peh a.

(20)

the path c in m can be described in terms of an intrinsic parameter , so that for
points x of m which lie on the path c, we have x = x(). one can then write

where

a(x())dx = a()d,

a()  a(x())

dx()

d

.

it is the quantity a(), and the variations thereof, which we will identify with the
matrix valued functions of the product integral formalism.

let us next consider the loop operator. for simplicity, we assume that m has
trivial rst homology group with integer coecients, i.e., h1(m, z) = 0. this insures
that the loop may be taken to be the boundary of a two dimensional surface  in
m. more explicitly, we take the 2-surface to be an orientable submanifold of m. it
will be convenient to describe the properties of the 2-surface in terms of its intrinsic
parameters  and  or a, a = 0, 1. so, for the points of the manifold m, which lie
on , we have x = x(,  ). the components of the 1-form a on  can be obtained
by means of the vielbeins (by the standard pull-back construction):

v 
a = a x ().

5

thus, we get

aa = v 

a a.

the curvature 2-form f of the connection a is given by

f = da + a  a =

1
2

f dx  dx.

the components of f on  can again be obtained by means of the vielbeins:

fab = v 

a v 

b f.

we want to express the loop operator in terms of the product integral denition in
a specic way. to achieve this, we begin with the denition of the path ordered phase
factor in terms of a product integral. consider the continuous map a : [s0, s1]  cnn
where [s0, s1] is a real interval. then, we dene the non-abelian phase factor given
above in terms of a product integral as follows:

s0

per s1

a(s)ds



s1

ys0

ea(s)ds.

in particular, anticipating that we will identify the closed path c over which the
wilson loop is dened with the boundary of a 2-surface, it is convenient to work
from the beginning with the matrix valued functions a(,  ). this means that our
expression for the path ordered phase factor will depend on a parameter. that is, let

a : [0, 1]  [0, 1]  cnn,

(21)

where [0, 1] and [0, 1] are real intervals on the two surface  and hence in m.
then, we dene the path ordered phase factor

p (, 0;  ) =



y0

ea1(; )d

 per 

0

a1(; )d

.

(22)

in this expression, p indicates path ordering with respect to , as dened by the
product integral, while  is a parameter. to be able to describe such an operator for
a closed path, we similarly dene the path dependent operator

q(; , 0) =



y0

ea0(; )d 

 per 

0

a0(; )d 

.

(23)

in this case, the path ordering is with respect to  , and  is a parameter.

to prove the non-abelian version of the stokes theorem, we want to make use of
product integration techniques to express the holonomy loop operator as an integral
over a two dimensional surface bounded by the corresponding loop. in terms of the
intrinsic coordinates of such a surface, we can write this loop operator in the form

w (c) = peh aada

,

6

(24)

where, as mentioned above,

a = (, ) ;

a = (0, 1).

(25)

the expression for the loop operator depends only on the homotopy class of paths
in m to which the closed path c belongs. we can, therefore, parameterize the path
c in any convenient manner consistent with its homotopy class. in particular, we
can break up the path into piece wise continuous segments along which either  or 
remains constant. the composition rule for product integrals given by eq. (8) ensures
that this break up of the closed loop into a number of segments does not depend on
the intermediate points on the closed path, which are used for this purpose. so, we
write the closed loop operator as

w = w4 w3 w2 w1,

(26)

in this expression, wk, k = 1, .., 4, are wilson lines such that  = const. along w1 and
w3, and  = const. along w2 and w4. we emphasize that the expressions  = const.
and  = const. represent arbitrary curves.

to see the advantage of parameterizing the closed path in this manner, consider

the exponent of eq. (24) :

aada = a0d + a1d.

(27)

along each segment, one or the other of the terms on the right hand side vanishes.
 = 0 = const.. recalling eqs. (22)
for example, along the segment [0, ], we have 
and (23), we get for the segments w1 and w2, respectively,

w1 =



y0

ea1(;0)d

 per 

0

a1(;0)d

= p (, 0; 0),

(28)

and



w2 =

y0

ea0(; )d 

 per 

0

a0(; )d 

= q(; , 0).

(29)

when the 2-surface  requires more than one coordinate patch to cover it, the
connections in dierent coordinate patches must be related to each other in their
overlap region by transition functions [16]. then, the decomposition given in eq.
(26) must be suitably augmented to take this complication into account. the product
integral representation of the path ordered phase factor and the composition rule
for product integrals given by eq.
(8) will still make it possible to describe the
corresponding loop operator as a composite product integral. for deniteness, we
will conne ourselves to the representation given by eq. (26).

it is convenient for later purposes to dene two composite wilson line operators

u and t according to

u(,  ) = q(; , 0) p (, 0;  ),

(30)

7

using the rst of these, we have

t (;  ) = p (, 0;  ) q(0; , 0).

similarly, we have for w3 and w4

w2 w1 = u(,  ).

and

w3 = p 1(, 0;  ),

w4 = q1(0; , 0).

from the eq. (31), it follows that

w4 w3 = t 1(,  ).

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

(35)

appealing again to eq. (8) for the composition of product integrals, it is clear that
this expression for the wilson loop operator is independent of the choice of the point
(,  ).
in terms of the quantities t and u, the closed loop operator will take the
compact form

w = t 1(;  )u(;  ).

(36)

as a rst step in the proof of the non-abelian stokes theorem, we obtain the action

of the l-derivative operator on w :

l w = l [t 1(,  )q(; , 0)p (, 0; 0)].

(37)

using the denition of the l-operation given by eq. (12), noting that p (, 0; 0) is
independent of  , and carrying out the l operations on the right hand side (rhs),
we get

l w = l t 1(,  ) + t 1(,  ) [ l q(; , 0) +

+q(; , 0)(l p (, 0; 0))q1(; , 0)]t (,  ).

(38)

simplifying this expression by means of eqs. (12) and (13), we end up with

l w = t 1(,  )[a0(,  )  l t (,  )]t (,  ).

(39)

next, we prove the analog of eq.
integral, for the composite loop operator dened by eqs. (26) and (36).

(14), which applies to an elementary product

theorem 1 the loop operator given by eq. (36) can be expressed in the form

w =



y0

et 1(, )[a0(, )l t (, )]t (, )d 

.

(40)

8

to prove this theorem, rst we note from the denition of the l operation that the
right hand side (rhs) of this equation can be written as

rhs =



y0

e[t 1(; )a0(; )t (; )t 1(; ) 

  t (; )]d 

.

(41)

noting that t 1 t = l t , we can use the similarity theorem given by eq. (17)
to obtain



rhs = t 1(;  )

y0

ea0(; )d 

t (; 0).

(42)

moreover, making use of the dening eq. (23), we get

rhs = t 1(;  ) q(; , 0) p (, 0; 0) q(; 0, 0) = t 1(;  ) u(;  ).

(43)

the last line is clearly the expression for w given by eq. (36).

finally, we want to express the quantity w in yet another form which we state

as:

theorem 2 the loop operator dened in eq. (36) can be expressed as a surface
integral of the eld strength:

w =



y0

0

er 

t 1(; )f01(; )t (; )dd 

(44)

where f01 is the 0-1 component of the non-abelian eld strength.

to prove this theorem, we note that




[t 1(,  )a0(,  )t (,  )] = t 1(,  ) [a0(,  ) + [a0(,  ), a1(,  )]] t (,  ).
(45)

moreover,




{t 1(,  ) (l t (,  )) t (,  )} = t 1(,  ) a1(,  )t (,  ).

(46)

it then follows that



 {t 1(,  )[a0(,  )  l t (,  )]}t (,  )}

= t 1(,  )[ 

 a0(,  )  

 a1(,  ) + [a0(,  ), a1(,  )]}t (,  )

= t 1(,  )f01(,  )t (,  ).

(47)

the last step follows from the denition of the eld strength in terms of the connection
given above

f0 1 =




a0(,  ) 




a1(,  ) + [a0(,  ), a1(,  )].

(48)

9

integrating eq. (47) with respect to , we get

t 1(,  )[a0(,  )  l t (,  )]}t (,  )
t 1(;  )f0 1(;  )t (;  )dd .

= z 

0

we thus arrive at the surface integral representation of the loop operator [19]:

w =



y0

0

er 

t 1(; )f0 1(; )t (; )dd 

.

(49)

(50)

we note that in this expression the ordering of the operators is dened with respect
to  whereas  is a parameter. recalling the antisymmetry of the components of the
eld strength, we can rewrite this expression in terms of path ordered exponentials
familiar from the physics literature:

w = p e

dabt 1(; )fab(; )t (; ),

(51)

1

2r

where dab is the area element of the 2-surface. despite appearances, it must be
remembered that  and  play very dierent roles in this expression.

iv a second proof

to illustrate the power and the exibility of the product integral formalism, we give
here a variant of the previous proof for the non-abelian stokes theorem. this time
the proof makes essential use of the non-trivial relation (19) for product integrals.
we start with the form of w given in eq. (36) and take its derivatives with respect
to  :

w


=  q1(0; , 0)p 1(, 0;  )q(; , 0)p (, 0; 0) +

+q1(0; , 0) p 1(, 0;  )q(; , 0)p (, 0; 0) +
+q1(0; , 0)p 1(, 0;  ) q(; , 0)p (, 0; 0).

(52)

here, we have made use of the fact that p (, 0; 0) is independent of  . applying
eq. (12) to w and using eq. (31), we get

l w =

w


w 1 = t 1(;  ) [a0(;  )  p (, 0;  )a0(0;  )p 1(, 0;  ) 

 p (, 0;  )p 1(, 0;  )] t (;  ).

(53)

now we can use eq.
respect to the parameter  :

(19) to evaluate the derivative of the product integral with

 p (, 0;  ) = z 

0

dp (, ;  ) a1(;  )p (, 0;  ).

(54)

10

then, after some simple manipulations using the dening equations for the various
terms in eq. (53), we get:

t 1(;  ) p ( )p 1( )t (;  ) = z 

0

dt 1(;  ) a1(;  )t (;  ).

(55)

using eq. (9) and the fact that p (0, 0;  ) = 1, we can write the rest of eq. (53) as
an integral too:

t 1(;  )[a0(;  )  p (, 0;  )a0(0;  )p 1(, 0;  )]t (;  ) =

= q1(0; , 0)[p 1(, 0;  )a0(;  )p (, 0;  )  a0(0)]q(0; , 0) =
0 d p 1(, 0;  )( a0(,  ) + [a0(,  ), a1(,  )])p (, 0;  ).

(56)

= r 

combining eqs. (53), (55), and (56), we obtain:

l w =

w


w 1 = z 

0

dt 1(,  )f01(,  )t (,  ).

(57)

finally, recalling eq. (14), we are immediately led to eq. (50) which was obtained
by the previous method of proof.

there are two reasons for the relative simplicity of this proof over the one which
was given in the previous section. one is due to the use of dierentiation with respect
to a parameter according the eq. (19). the other is due to the use of eq. (14) for
the composite operator w . in the rst proof, the use of this theorem for w was not
assumed. its justication for using it in the second proof lies in the composition law
for product integrals given by eq. (8).

v gauge covariance of the result

as a consistency check, we must show that the surface representation given by eq.
(50) is gauge covariant. to this end, it will be recalled that under a gauge trans-
formation, the components of the connection, i.e. the gauge potentials, transform
according to [20]

a(x)  g(x)a(x)g1(x)  g(x)g(x)1.

the components of the eld strength (curvature) transform covariantly:

f(x)  g(x)f(x)g1(x).

from these, it follows that [20]

a(x)dx

a

per b

 g(b)(cid:18)per b

a

a(x)dx(cid:19) g1(a),

11

(58)

(59)

(60)

equivalently, from its dinition (22) in terms of product integrals, it is easy to show
that the gauge transform of the quantity p (, 0;  ) has the form

g(;  )g1(0;  )



y0

eg(0; )a1(; )g1(0; ).

(61)

to show the gauge covariance of the surface representation, we need to know how
the operator t (,  ) transforms under gauge transformations. to this end, we note
that the wilson line q(; , 0) given by eq. (23) transforms as

q(; , 0) =



y0

ea0(; )d 

 g(;  )q(; , 0)g1(; 0).

(62)

then, the gauge transform of the composite operator t (,  ) given by eq. (31) follows
immediately:

t (;  ) = p (, 0;  ) q(0; , 0)  g(;  )t (;  )g1(0; 0).

(63)

from the above results, it is straight forward to show that the surface integral

representation of wilson loop transforms as

w 



y0

e

g(0;0)(cid:16)r 

0

t 1(; )f01(; )t (; )dt(cid:17)g1(0;0)

.

(64)

it follows from the composition rule (8) that the constant factors in the exponent
factorize, so that under gauge transformations the surface representation of transforms
covariantly, i.e.,

w  g(0; 0)



y0

0

er 

t 1(; )f01(; )t (; )dt

g1(0; 0).

(65)

we view this result as a nontrivial conrmation of our proofs.

vi concluding remarks

we have provided two proofs of the non-abelian stokes theorem using the product
integral method. an immediate question which comes to mind is whether there is a
supersymmetric generalization of this theorem. given the important developments in
supersymmetric gauge theories in recent years, this question is not merely of academic
interest. to explore this possibility using the product integral method, it is necessary
to generalize this method to encompass grassmann valued operators. it turns out
that such a generalization is indeed possible [21]. further developments of this subject
will be reported in a forthcoming work.
