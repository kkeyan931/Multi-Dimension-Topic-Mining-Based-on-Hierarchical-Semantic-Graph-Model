abstract

a supersymmetric action functional describing the interaction of the fundamental superstring with

the d = 10, type iib dirichlet super-9-brane is presented. a set of supersymmetric equations for

the coupled system is obtained from the action principle. it is found that the interaction of the string

endpoints with the superd9brane gauge eld requires some restrictions for the image of the gauge eld

strength. when those restrictions are not imposed, the equations imply the absence of the endpoints,

and the equations coincide either with the ones of the free super-d9-brane or with the ones for the free

closed type iib superstring. dierent phases of the coupled system are described. a generalization to

an arbitrary system of intersecting branes is discussed.

introduction

intersecting branes and branes ending on branes receive much attention now [1][9] in relation
with the development of m-theory [10] and its application to gauge theories [11, 12]. however,
the studies of [1][9] were performed for the pure bosonic limit of the brane systems or for a
supersymmetric description in the framework of the probe brane approach only.

in the rst case they are based upon the observation that the ground state should not include
the nontrivial expectation values of the fermions in order to keep (part of) the lorentz invariance
(corresponding to the conguration of the branes). then it is possible to justify that some of
the pure bosonic solutions preserve part of the target space supersymmetry and, just due to this
property, saturate the bogomolnyi bound and are thus stable (see e.g. [13] and refs. therein).

in the second case one of the branes is treated in an the external eld of the other brane.
the latter can be considered either as the solution of low energy supergravity theory [1, 3], or,
in the frame of the superembedding approach [14, 15, 16, 17, 18], as a superspace, where the
ends of the probe brane are living [6, 7, 8]. in such an approach the -symmetry of the probe
brane plays an essential role for studying the host brane and the coupled system.

despite many successes of these approaches, it is desirable to obtain a complete and mani-

festly supersymmetric description of interacting brane systems.

of course, the preservation of supersymmetry in the presence of boundaries (including the
boundaries of open branes ending on other branes) requires the analysis of anomalies [19, 2],
while at the classical level the boundary breaks at least half of the supersymmetry [20, 21,
2]. so at that level one may search for an action for a coupled brane system, which includes
manifestly supersymmetric bulk terms for all the branes and allows direct variations. the term
supersymmetric will be used below for an action of this type.

the main problem to be faced in a search for such an action is that the coordinate functions
of intersecting branes (or of the open brane and host brane), which dene embeddings of their
worldvolumes, say

m1+p = ( m), m = 0, . . . p

and m1+p

= (m

), m = 0, . . . p

into the tangent superspace m(d | n .2[d/2]) = (x m, i ),
i = 1, . . . n ):

(m = 0, . . . d 1,  = 1, . . . 2[d/2],

m1+p  m(d | n .2[d/2]) :

x m = x m(),

i = i ()

and

m1+p

 m(1+(d1)|n .2[d/2]) :

i = i ()

x m = x m(),
should be identied at the intersection m  m1+p  m1+p
m  m1+p  m1+p

= ( r), r = 0, . . . , dim(m)  1:
i (( )) = i (( )).
(1.1)
hence the variations  x(),  () and  x(),  () may not be considered as completely inde-
pendent.

 m(d | n .2[d/2]) :

x m(( )) = x m(( )),

2

recently we proposed two procedures to solve this problem and to obtain a supersymmetric
action for an interacting brane system [22]. one of them provides the necessary identication
(1.1) by the lagrange multiplier method (sspe or superspace embedded action [22]). another
((d-1)-brane dominance approach or goldstone fermion embedded (gfe) action) involves a
(dynamical or auxiliary) space-time lling brane and uses the identication of all the grassmann
coordinate elds of lower dimensional branes (), () with the images of the (d-1)-brane
grassmann coordinate elds

() = (x()),

() = (x()).

(1.2)

we considered the general properties of the equations of motion which follows from such actions
using the example of a superstring ending on a superd3brane. it was found that both ap-
proaches are equivalent and thus justify one the other. the super9brane was considered as an
auxiliary object in [22]. the study of supersymmetric equations of motion for this system will
be the subject of forthcoming paper [23].

here we elaborate another example of the dynamical system consisting of the fundamental
superstring ending on the super-d9brane. we present explicitly the action for the coupled
system and obtain equations of motion by its direct variation.

as the super-d9brane is the space timelling brane of the type iib superspace, the gfe
approach is most natural in this case. moreover, the system involving the dynamical space time
lling brane has some peculiar properties which are worth studying (see e.g. [24]). on the other
hand, it can be regarded as a relatively simple counterpart of the supersymmetric dynamical
system including superbranes and supergravity (see [22] for some preliminary considerations).

several problems arise when one tries to nd the action for a coupled system of the space
time lling superbrane and another superpbrane. the main one is how to formulate the
supersymmetric generalization of the current (or, more precisely, dual current form) distributions
jd(p+1) with support localized on the brane worldvolume m1+p. such distributions can be
used to present the action of a lower dimensional brane as an integral over the ddimensional
spacetime, or, equivalently, to the (d-1)brane worldvolume. then the action for the coupled
system of the lower dimensional branes and the space-time lling brane acquires the form of an
integral over the ddimensional manifold and permits direct variation.

the solution of this problem was presented in [22] and will be elaborated here in detail.
for the space-time lling brane the world volume spans the whole bosonic part of the target
superspace. as a consequence, it produces a nonlinear realization of the target space super-
symmetry. the expression for the supersymmetry transformations of the bosonic current form
distributions (which was used in [25] for the description of the interacting bosonic mbranes
[26, 27, 28]) vanishes when the above mentioned identication of the grassmann coordinates of
the lower dimensional brane with the image of the grassmann coordinate eld of the space-time
lling brane is imposed. this observation provides us with the necessary current distribution
form and is the key point of our construction1.

1 it is convenient to rst adapt the description of the currents to the language of dual current forms, whose

usefulness had been pointed out in [29, 30].

3

the second problem is related to the fact that the distributions jdp1 can be used to lift

the (p + 1) dimensional integral to the ddimensional one,

zm1+p

lp+1 = zmd

jdp1  lp+1,

(1.3)

only when the integrated (p + 1)-form lp+1 can be considered as a pullback of a d-dimensional
(p + 1)-form lp+1 living on md onto the (p + 1)dimensional surface m1+p  md.

thus, e.g. the superstring wess-zumino form can be easily lifted up to (i.e. rewritten as)
the integral over the whole d9-brane worldvolume. however, not the entire superstring actions
are written as an integral of a pull-back of a 10-dimensional form. for example, the kinetic term
of the polyakov formulation of the (super)string action

zm1+1 lp olyakov

 mn  zm1+1

m  nmn

(1.4)

with

m  d x m()  id i m i = d m
 ,

 = (, ),

mn = diag(+1,1, . . . ,1)

does not possess such a formulation. moreover, it is unclear how to dene a straightforward
extension of the 2form lp olyakov

to the whole 10-dimensional space-time.

2

the same problem exists for the dirac-nambu-goto and dirac-born-infeld kinetic terms of

super-dp-branes and usual super-p-branes.

though it is possible to treat the lifting relation (1.3) formally (see e.g. [25] for a description
of bosonic m-branes), to address the delicate problems of the supersymmetric coupled brane
system it is desirable to have a version of the superstring and superbrane actions which admits
a straightforward and explicit lifting to the whole 10dimensional space or to the whole d9-
brane world volume. fortunately, such a formulation does exist.
it is the so-called lorentz
harmonic formulation of the superstring [31] which includes auxiliary moving frame (lorentz
harmonic) variables, treated as worldsheet elds. this is a geometric (in a sense the rst-order)
action which can be written in terms of dierential forms without use of the hodge operation
[14, 15]. the only world volume eld which is not an image of a target space one is just the
moving frame eld (harmonics). however, it is possible to extend this eld to an auxiliary 10-
dimensional so(1, 9)/(so(1, 1)  so(8) sigma model, which is subject to the only condition
that it should coincide with the stringy harmonics when restricted to the string worldsheet 2.
in this way we obtain a supersymmetric action for the interacting system including super-
d9-brane and a fundamental superstring ending on the d9-brane, derive the supersymmetric
equations of motion directly from the variation of the action and study dierent phases of the
coupled dynamical system. we shortly discuss as well the generalization of our approach for the
case of an arbitrary system of intersecting branes.

for simplicity we are working in at target d = 10 type iib superspace. the generaliza-
tion to brane systems in arbitrary supergravity background is straightforward. moreover, our

2just the existence of the lorentz harmonic actions for superdbranes [32, 33, 34] and supermbranes
[15, 35] guarantees the correctness of the formal approach to the action functional description of interacting
bosonic systems [25].

approach allows to involve supergravity in an interacting brane system. to this end one can
include a counterpart of the group manifold action for supergravity in the functional describing
interacting branes instead of (or together with) the spacetime lling brane action.

in section 2 we consider the peculiar features of an interacting system which contains a space-
time lling brane. we describe an induced embedding of the superstring worldsheet into the
d9-brane worldvolume. the geometric action [34] and the geometric (rst order) form of the
supersymmetric equations of motion for the superd9brane are presented in section 3. section
4 is devoted to the description of the geometric (twistorlike lorentz harmonic) action and of
the equations of motion for the free type iib superstring. here lorentz harmonic variables are
used and the issue of supersymmetry breaking by boundaries is addressed briey. in section
5 we introduce the density with support localized on the superstring worldsheet and motivate
that it becomes invariant under d = 10 type iib supersymmetry when the identication (1.2)
is imposed.

the action functional describing the interacting system of the superd9brane and the (in
general open) fundamental superstring (ending on the super-d9-brane) is presented in section
6. the equations of motion of the interacting system are derived in section 7 and analyzed
in section 8. the issues of kappa-symmetry and supersymmetry in the coupled system are
addressed there. in the last section we summarize our results and also discuss a generalization
of our approach to an arbitrary system of intersecting branes.

2 the space-time lling brane

the embedding of the superd9brane worldvolume

m1+9 = {xm},

m = 0, . . . , 9

(2.1)

into the d = 10 type ii target superspace
m(1+9|32) = {x m, 1, 2},

m = 0, . . . , 9

 = 1, . . . , 16

(2.2)

can be described locally by the coordinate superfunctions

x m = x m(xm),

i = i(xm),

i = 1, 2.

(2.3)

in addition, there is an intrinsic world volume gauge eld living on the d9-brane world volume

a = dxmam(xn).

(2.4)

for nonsingular d9-brane congurations the function x m(xm) should be assumed to be

nondegenerate in the sense det (nx m(xm)) 6= 0. thus the inverse function

xm = xm(x m)

(2.5)

does exist and, hence, the grassmann coordinate functions (2.3) and the born-infeld gauge eld
(2.4) can be considered as functions of x m variables. in this manner an alternative parametriza-
tion of the d9-brane world volume is provided by

m1+9  m(1+9|32) : m1+9 = {(x m, i(x m))},

a = dx mam(x n),

(2.6)

5

which claries the fact that the d = 10, type ii superd9brane is a theory of volkov-akulov
goldstone fermion [36] combined into a supermultiplet with the vector eld am(x n) (see [34]).
through the intermediate step (2.5), (2.6) we can dene the induced embedding of the

superstring worldsheet into the d9-brane world volume.

2.1

induced embedding of the superstring worldsheet

indeed, the embedding of the fundamental superstring worldsheet

m1+1 = {()} = {(++), ()},

(++) =  + ,

() =   ,

(2.7)

into the d = 10 type iib target superspace m(1+9|32) (2.2) can be described locally by the
coordinate superfunctions

x m = x m(()),

i = i(()),

i = 1, 2.

(2.8)

however, using the existence of the inverse function (2.5), one can dene the induced embedding
of the worldsheet into the d9-brane world volume

xm = xm()  xm(cid:16) x m()(cid:17) .

(2.9)

as superstring and superd9brane live in the same d = 10 type iib superspace, we can
use the identication of the grassmann coordinate elds of the superstring with the images of
the grassmann coordinate elds of the superd9brane (goldstone fermions) on the worldsheet

i(()) = i( x m(())),

or, equivalently,

x m(()) = x m(cid:16)xm(())(cid:17) ,

i(()) = i(cid:16)xm(())(cid:17) ,

to study the interaction of the fundamental superstring with the super-d9-brane.

(2.10)

(2.11)

the approach based on such an identication was called goldstone fermion embedded
(gfe) in [22] because, from another viewpoint, the superstring worldsheet can be regarded as
embedded into goldstone fermion theory rather than into superspace.

2.2 tangent and cotangent space.

between these matrices which reect the invariance of the d = 10 sigma matrices under the
lorentz group transformations (see [31, 14]). the variables (2.20), (2.21) are not necessary for
the description of the superd9brane itself. however, as we shall see below, they are useful
for the description of the coupled system including a brane ending on (interacting with) the
d9-brane.

for that system it is important to note that the pull-backs of bosonic supervielbein forms m
or ea of type iib superspace can be used as a basis in the space cotangent to the world-volume
of d9brane. in other words, it is convenient to use the invertibility of the matrix  m
(2.17)
n
and the harmonic variables to dene the covariant basis m and the one a of the space tangent
to the d9-brane worldvolume by

3 geometric action and equations of motion for super-d9-brane

3.1 geometric action

the geometric action for the superd9brane in at d = 10, type iib superspace is [34]

s = zm10 l10 = zm10

where

(l0

(3.3)

(3.4)

a = dxmam(x) is the gauge eld inherent to the dirichlet branes, b2 represents the nsns
gauge eld with at superspace value

b2 = im (cid:16)d1m1  d2m2(cid:17) + d1m1  d2m2

and eld strength

(3.5)

(3.6)

h3 = db2 = im (cid:16)d1m  d1  d2m  d2(cid:17) .

the wess-zumino lagrangian form is the same as the one appearing in the standard formulation
[37, 38, 39, 40, 41]

where the formal sum of the rr superforms c = c0 + c2 + ... and of the external powers of the
2form

(3.8)
(e.g. f2  f f etc.) is used and |10 means the restriction to the 10superform input. let us
note that the restriction of the same expression (3.7) to the (p + 1)form input (where p = 2k 1
is odd)

(3.9)

describes the wess-zumino term of the super-dp-brane of type iib theory [37, 39, 41]. this
will be important for the description of the supersymmetric generalization of the born-infeld
equations for the d9-brane gauge elds, where the d7-brane wess-zumino term appears.

for most applications only the external derivative of the wess-zumino term is important. it

has the form

dlw z

10 = ef  r|11,

r = 5

n=0r2n+1,

3.2 variation of geometrical action for d9-brane

the simplest way to vary the geometrical action (3.1)(3.4) starts by taking the external deriva-
tive of the lagrangian form l10 (cf. [32, 34])
dl10 = (cid:16)dq8 + dlw z

+o(cid:16)(f2  f2)2)(cid:17) ,
where f2  da  b2 (3.8) and f2  1
2 m  nfnm. note that f2  f2 vanishes due to the
algebraic equation which is implied by the lagrange multiplier q8. this is the reason why the
terms proportional to the second and higher (external) powers of (f2  f2) are indicated by
o(cid:0)(f2  f2)2)(cid:1) but not written explicitly.

then we can use the seminal formula

 (cid:17) +

l10 = idl10 + d(il10)

(3.15)

(usually applied for coordinate variations only) supplemented by the formal denition of the
contraction with variation symbol

id1,2 = 1,2,

ida = a,

im = x m  i1m1  i2m2,
. . . .

idfmn = fmn,

idq8 = q8,

(3.16)

(3.17)

to simplify the algebraic calculations, one notes that it is sucient to write such a formal
contraction modulo terms proportional to the square of the algebraic equations (the latter re-
mains the same for the coupled system as well, because the auxiliary elds, e.g. q8, do not
appear in the action of other branes):

it is important that a enters the compact expression (3.18) for the variation of the super

d9brane action only in the combination

i (f2  f2)  (cid:0)a  ib2 + nfnmim(cid:1) .

(3.22)

it can be called a supersymmetric variation of the gauge eld as the condition i (f2  f2) = 0
actually determines the supersymmetric transformations of the gauge elds (cf.
[37, 32, 34]).
together with (3.16), the expression (3.22) denes the basis of supersymmetric variations, whose
use simplies in an essential manner the form of the equations of motion.

the formal external derivative of the lagrangian form (3.14) can be used as well for the

general coordinate variation of the action (3.1)-(3.4)

where for any q-form qq the operation im is dened by

sd9 = zm1+9

(3.24)
for the free superd9brane such a variation vanishes identically when the eld equations
of motion are taking into account. this reects the evident dieomorphism invariance of the
action (3.1). it is not essential as well in the study of coupled branes in the present approach,
while in another approach for the description of coupled superbranes [22] such variations play
an important role.

3.3 equations of motion for superd9brane

the equations of motion from the geometric action (3.1)(3.4) split into the algebraic ones
obtained from the variation of auxiliary elds q8 and fmn

and the dynamical ones

(3.29)

the fermionic equations (3.28) appear as a result of the variation with respect to 2, while
the variation with respect to 1 does not produce any independent equations. this fact reects
the noether identity corresponding to the local fermionic symmetry of the superd9brane
action (3.1) [34].

the explicit irreducible form of the d9-brane -symmetry transformation can be written

with the help of the spintensor eld h (3.19)  (3.21) [34] as

1 = ,


2 = h

q8 = 0.

(3.30)

(3.31)

the noether identity reecting the evident dieomorphism invariance of the action (3.1) is

the dependence of the equations obtained by varying the action (3.1) with respect to x m(x)

(3.32)

indeed it can be proved that eq. (3.32) is satised identically, when eq.(3.28) is taken into
account.

turning back to the fermionic equations (3.28), let us note that after decomposition

and m dened by d = dxmm = mm (2.23), (2.24), one arrives for (3.28) at [34]

this matrix describes a moving frame attached to the worldsheet and thus provides the pos-

(4.4)

the properties of the harmonics (4.3) are collected in the appendix a. to obtain equations
of motion from the geometric action (4.1) it is important that the variations of the light-like
harmonics um should be performed with the constraint (4.3), i.e. with

4.3 linearized fermionic equations

the proof of equivalence of the lorentz harmonic formulation (4.1) with the standard action
of the green-schwarz superstring has been given in [31]. to make this equivalence intuitively
evident, let us consider the fermionic equations of motion (4.21), (4.22) in the linearized approx-
imation, xing a static gauge

x  x mum = ().

(4.23)

14

moreover, we use the symmetry (4.16) to remove half the components 1+
2v  q , of the grassmann coordinate elds

q = 1v +

q , 2q =

1+

q = 1v +

q = 0,

2q = 2v  q = 0.

thus we are left with 8 bosonic and 16 fermionic elds

x i = x  u i
m,

1q = 1v  q ,

2+

q = 2v +
q .

(4.24)

(4.25)

in the linearized approximation all the inputs from the derivatives of harmonic variables (i.e.
cartan forms (4.9), (4.10)) disappear from the fermionic equations for the physical grassmann
coordinate elds. thus we arrive at the counterpart of the gauge xed string theory in the
lightcone gauge. then it is not hard to see that eqs. (4.21), (4.22) reduce to the opposite
chirality conditions for physical fermionic elds

1q = 0,



++ 2+

q = 0.

(4.26)

to obtain the bosonic equations, the derivatives of the harmonics (cartan forms (4.9)) must
be taken into account. after exclusion of the auxiliary variables one obtains that eqs. (4.19),
(4.20) reduce to the usual free eld equations for 8 bosonic elds x i (see appendix b for details)

++ x i = 0.

(4.27)

4.4 geometric action with boundary term

to formulate the interaction of the open superstring with the superd9brane we have to add
to the action (4.1) the boundary term which describes the coupling to the gauge eld a =
dxmam(x) inherent to the d9-brane (see (3.4), (3.7), (3.8), (3.9)). thus the complete action for
the open fundamental superstring becomes (cf. [8])

si = siib + sb = z

m(1+1)

l2 = z

m(1+1)

(cid:18) 1

2

e++  e  b2(cid:19) + zm(1+1)

a .

(4.28)

the variation of the action (4.28) diers fromr idliib

in the supersymmetric basis (3.16), (3.22) the variation becomes

2

in (4.14) by boundary contributions.

si = zm1+1

idliib
e++um

i (f2  f2) +
m  mfnm(cid:19) im.

eu++

(4.29)

it is worth mentioning that no boundary contribution with variation i appears. this does
not contradict the wellknown fact that the presence of a worldsheet boundary breaks at least a
half of the target space n = 2 supersymmetry. indeed, for the supersymmetry transformations

susyx m = i mi ,

susyi = i

(4.30)

15

the variation im is nonvanishing and reads

isusy m = 2susyx m = 2i mi .

(4.31)

imposing the boundary conditions 1(( )) = 2(( )) one arrives at the conservation of
n = 1 supersymmetry whose embedding into the type iib supersymmetry group is dened
by 1 = 2. actually these conditions provide i m(( )) = 0 and, as a consequence, the
vanishing of the variation (4.29) (remember that the supersymmetry transformations of the
gauge elds are dened by i(f2  f2) = 0).

the above consideration in the frame of the lorentz harmonic approach results in the inter-
esting observation that the supersymmetry breaking by a boundary is related to the classical
reparametrization anomaly: indeed the second line of the expression (4.29), which produces the
nonvanishing variation under n = 2 supersymmetry transformation with (4.31), contains only
im , which can be regarded as parameters of the reparametrization gauge symmetry of the
free superstring (imum ) and free superd3brane (im), respectively.

there exists a straightforward way to keep half of the rigid target space supersymmetry
of the superstringsuper-d9-brane system by incorporation of the additional boundary term

rm1+1 1(cid:16) 1(( ))  2(( ))(cid:17) with a grassmann lagrange multiplier one form 1 (see

appendix a in [22]). however, following [2, 6, 22], we accept in our present paper the soft
breaking of the supersymmetry by boundaries at the classical level (see [19, 2] for symmetry
restoration by anomalies). we expect that the bps states preserving part of the target space
supersymmetry will appear as particular solutions of the coupled superbrane equations following
from our action.

5 current forms and unied description of string and d9-brane

5.1 supersymmetric current form

for a simultaneous description of superd9brane and fundamental superstring, we have to
dene an 8-form distribution j8 with support on the string worldsheet. in the pure bosonic case
(see e.g. [25]) one requires

where

zm1+1
l2 =

1
2

j8  l2,

l2 = zm1+9
dx m  dx nlnm(x l)

is an arbitrary two-form in the d = 10 dimensional space-time m1+9 and

l2 =

1
2

d x m()  d x n()lnm( x m())

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

is its pull-back onto the string worldsheet.

it is not hard to verify that the appropriate expression for the current form j8 is given by

[25]

j8 = (dx)8

nmj nm(x) =

1

2!8!

mnn1...n8dx n1. . .dx n8zm1+1

d x m()d x n()10(cid:16)x  x()(cid:17) .

(5.4)

16

indeed, inserting (5.4) and (5.2) into r.h.s. of (5.1), using (3.13) and changing the order of
integrations, after performing the integration over d10x one arrives at the l.h.s. of (5.1).

5.2 superstring boundaries and current (non)conservation

if the superstring worldsheet is closed (m1+1 = 0) the current j mn is conserved, i.e. j8 is a
closed form

m1+1 = 0



dj8 = 0,



mj nm = 0.

(5.5)

for the open (super)string this does not hold. indeed, assuming that the 10-dimensional
space and the d9-brane worldvolume has no boundaries m1+9 = 0, substituting instead of l2
a closed two form, say da, and using stokes theorem one arrives at

zm1+1

a = zm1+1

da =zm1+9

j8  da = zm1+9

dj8  a.

(5.6)

thus the form dj8 has support localized at the boundary of the worldsheet (i.e. on the worldline
of the string endpoints).

this again can be justied by an explicit calculation with eqs. (5.4) and (3.13), which results

in

with

dj8 = (dx)9

n mj mn(x) = (dx)9

n jn(x)

mj mn(x) = jn(x),

jn(x)  zm1+1

d x m( )10(cid:16)x  x( )(cid:17) ,

(5.7)

(5.8)

where the proper time  parametrizes the boundary of the string worldsheet m1+1 = {}.

actually the boundary of superstring(s) shall have (at least) two connected components
j , each parametrized by the own proper time j. then the rigorous expression

m1+1 = jm1
for the boundary current (5.7), (5.8) is

jn(x)  jzm1

j

d x m(j)10(cid:16)x  x(j)(cid:17) .

we, however, will use the simplied notations (5.8) in what follows.

it is useful to dene the local density 1form j1 on the worldsheet with support on the

boundary of worldsheet

which has the properties

j1 = dzm1+1

d ( )2(cid:16)  ( )(cid:17) ,

zm1+1

a zm1+1

d a = zm1+1

j1  a = zm1+9

dj8  a

for any 1-form

a = dx mam(x),

(5.9)

(5.10)

e.g., for the d9-brane gauge eld (2.4) considered in the special parametrization (2.5), (2.6).

17

in the sense of the last equality in (5.10) one can write a formal relation

(which cannot be treated straightforwardly as the form j1 can not be regarded as pull-back of a
10-dimensional 1-form).

dj8 = j8  j1

(5.11)

5.3 variation of current form distributions and supersymmetry

the variation of the form (5.4) becomes

j8 = 3(dx)8

[mnk]zm1+1
2(dx)8

mnzm1+1

d x m()  d x n()(cid:16)x k   x k()(cid:17) 10(cid:16)x  x()(cid:17) 

(5.12)

d x m( )(cid:16)x n   x n( )(cid:17) 10(cid:16)x  x( )(cid:17) .

let us turn to the target space supersymmetry transformations (4.30). for the string coor-

dinate elds it has the form

 x m() = i ()mi,

 i = i

while for the super-d9-brane it reads

x m(x) = i(x)mi,

i(x) = i.

(5.13)

(5.14)

in the parametrization (2.6) corresponding to the introduction of the inverse function (2.5)

the transformation (5.14) coincides with the goldstone fermion realization

x m = i(x)i ,

i(x)  i (x)  i(x) = i

(5.15)

thus, if we identify the x m entering the current density (5.4) with the bosonic coordinates
of superspace, parametrizing the super-d9-brane by (2.5), we can use (5.12) to obtain the
supersymmetry transformations of the current density (5.4)

j8 = 3(dx)8

[mnk]zm1+1
2(dx)8

mnzm1+1

d x m()  d x n()(cid:16)i (x)  i ()(cid:17) ki 10(cid:16)x  x()(cid:17)  (5.16)

d x m( )(cid:16)i (x)  i ( )(cid:17) ni 10(cid:16)x  x( )(cid:17) .

now it is evident that the current density (5.4) becomes invariant under the supersymmetry

transformations (5.13), (5.14) after the identication

i() = i(cid:16) x()(cid:17)

(5.17)

of the superstring coordinate elds i () with the image i(cid:16) x()(cid:17) of the superd9brane

coordinate eld i (x) is implied.

18

5.4 manifestly supersymmetric representations for the distribution form

in the presence of the d9-brane whose world volume spans the whole d = 10 dimensional
super-time, we can rewrite (5.4) as

j8 = (dx)8

nmj nm(x) =

1

2!8!

nmn1...n8dxn1  . . .  dxn8zm1+1

dxm()  dxn()10 (x  x()) ,

(5.18)
where the function x() is dened through x() with the use of the inverse function (2.5), i.e.
x() = x(x()) , cf. (2.9).

passing from (5.4) to (5.18) the identity

10(cid:16)x  x()(cid:17)  10 (x  x(x())) =

1
det( x
x )

10 (x  x())

(5.19)

has to be taken into account.

the consequences of this observation are two-fold:

 i) we can use j8 to represent an integral over the string worldsheet as an integral over the

d9-brane worldvolume 4

for any 2form

zm1+1

l2 =

j8  l2

l2 = zm1+9

(5.20)

(5.21)

living on the d9brane world volume m1+9, e.g. for the eld strength f2 = da b2 (3.8)
of the d9-brane gauge eld (2.4). the pullback

dxm()  dxn()lnm(xl())
is dened in (5.20) with the use of the inverse function (2.5).

l2 =

1
2

(5.22)

 ii) as the coordinates xn are inert under the target space supersymmetry (4.30), the

current density j8 is supersymmetric invariant. hence, when the identication (5.17)

i() = i (x())

(5.23)

is made, it is possible to use eqs. (5.1), (5.20), (5.18) to lift the complete superstring
action (4.28) to the 10-dimensional integral form.

the manifestly supersymmetric form of the current density appears after passing to the
supersymmetric basis (2.15), (2.18) of the space tangential to m1+9. with the decomposition
(2.15) j8 becomes

j8 = ()8

the supersymmetric case.

19

in eq. (5.24) the only piece where the supersymmetric invariance is not manifest is 10(cid:16)x  x()(cid:17).

however, in terms of d9-brane world volume coordinates we arrive at

6 an action for the coupled system

in order to obtain a covariant action for the coupled system with the current form j8, one more
step is needed. indeed, our lifting rules (5.1) with the density j8 (5.4), (5.18) are valid for a form
l2 which is the pull-back of a form l2 living either on the whole d = 10 type iib superspace
(5.2), or, at least, on the whole 10-dimensional worldvolume of the super-d9-brane (5.21). thus
imposing the identication (5.23) we can straightforwardly rewrite the wess-zumino term r b2
and the boundary term of the superstring action r a as integrals over the superd9brane world
volume r j8  b2 +r dj8  a.

but the kinetic term of the superstring action

zm1+1

l0  zm1+1

2

e++  e

(6.1)

with e++, e dened by eqs. (4.2) requires an additional consideration regarding the har-
monics (4.3), which so far were dened only as worldsheet elds.

in order to represent the kinetic term (6.1) as an integral over the d9-brane world volume
too, we have to introduce a counterpart of the harmonic elds (4.3), (4.12) in the whole 10-
dimensional space or in the d9-brane world volume

(6.2)

(6.3)

(see (4.3)(2.22)).

such a lifting of the harmonics to the superd9brane worldvolume creates the elds of an
auxiliary ten dimensional so(1, 9)/(so(1, 1)  so(8)) sigma model. the only restriction for
these new elds is that they should coincide with the stringy harmonics on the worldsheet:

7 supersymmetric equations for the coupled system

7.1 algebraic equations

the lagrange multiplier q8 and auxiliary eld fmn are not involved into the superstring action
(4.28), while the harmonics are absent in the superd9brane part (3.1)(3.4) of the action
(6.6). thus we conclude that the algebraic equations (3.25), (3.26), (4.19) are the same as in
the free models.

7.1.1 equations obtained from varying the harmonics

indeed, variation with respect to the harmonics (now extended to the whole d = 10 space time
or, equivalently, to the superd9brane world volume (6.2)) produces the equations

j8  ei  e = 0



j8  ei  j8  mui

m = 0

whose image on the worldsheet coincides with eq. (4.19) 5

ei  m()ui

m() = 0 .

(7.1)

(7.2)

5the precise argument goes as follows: take the integral of eq. (7.1) with an arbitrary 10-dimensional test
function f (x). the integral of the forms ei  e++ and ei  e multiplied by arbitrary functions f ( x) vanishes

ei

 e++f ( x) = 0,

zm(1+1)

zm(1+1)

ei

 ef ( x) = 0.

from the arbitrariness of f ( x) then both 2-forms are identically zero on the world sheet ei  e++ = ei  e = 0.
and from the independence of the pullbacks e++, e indeed (4.19) follows.

21

now it becomes clear why the basis ea (2.12)

ea = (cid:16)e++, e, ei(cid:17)

e = mum ,

ei = mui

m,

(7.3)

whose pull-back on the string worldsheet coincides with (4.4), is particularly convenient for the
study of the coupled system. the dual basis a (2.24) is constructed with the auxiliary moving

(cf. (2.23)). due to (7.2), only the terms proportional to e++, e survive in the pullbacks

q = e e+qi

e qi  d i v  q = e e qi

(7.9)

(7.10)

an alternative way to represent eqs. (7.8), (7.9), (7.10) is provided by the use of the current

density (5.18), (5.25) and the equivalent version (7.1) of eq. (7.2)

j8  di = j8  ei (x),

q = j8  ee+qi
j8  e+qi  j8  di v +

j8  e qi  j8  di v  q = j8  ee qi

(7.13)

on the other hand, one can solve eq. (7.1) with respect to the current density. to this
m (see (2.12), (6.2)) in the expression (5.25)

end we have to change the basis m  ea = aua

(remember that det(u) = 1 due to (6.2)). then the solution of (7.1) becomes

let us stress that, in contrast to the free borninfeld equation (3.27), eq. (7.22) has a right

the second and third lines of eq.(7.24) vanish identically on the surface of the free fermionic
equations of the free d9-brane and of the free superstring, respectively. these are the noether
identities reecting the dieomorphism invariance of the free d9-brane and the free superstring
actions. hence, it is natural to postpone the discussion of eq. (7.24) and turn to the fermionic
equations for the coupled system.

7.3 fermionic eld equations

the remaining fermionic variation 1 produces an equation which includes the form j8

with support localized at the worldsheet only:

j8 (cid:16)e++  e1q v  q  e  e2+

note that the source localized on the worldsheet of the open brane, as in (7.26) is charac-
teristic for the system including a space-time lling brane. for the structure of the fermionic
equations in the general case we refer to [22].

8 phases of the coupled system

it is useful to start with the fermionic equations of motion (7.26), (7.29), (7.30).

first of all we have to note that in the generic phase there are no true (complete) noether
identities for the symmetry in the equations for the coupled system, as all the 32 fermionic
equations are independent.

8.1 generic phase describing decoupled system and appearance of other

phases

in the generic case we shall assume that the matrix hqp(x()) = hqp() is invertible (det(hqp) 6= 0,
for the case det(hqp) = 0 see section 7.3). then eq.
p = 0 and
immediately results in the reduction of the eq. (7.29):

(7.30) implies e  e2+

det(hqp) 6= 0



( e++  e1q = 0
e  e2+

q = 0

(8.1)

the equations (8.1) have the same form as the free superstring equations of motion (4.21),

(4.22). as a result, the r.h.s. of eq. (7.26) vanishes

det(hqp) 6= 0



9

mq| + f|( + f )1 mnn (cid:16)d2  d1h 

 (cid:17) = 0

(8.2)

which coincides with the fermionic equation for the free superd9brane (3.28). then the third
line in the equations of motion for x m coordinate elds (7.24) vanishes, as it does in the free
superd9brane case (3.32). as the second line in eq. (7.24) is zero due to the equations (8.1)
e 2+
(e.g. e2+
q = 0), in the generic case
(8.1) the equations of motion for x eld (7.24) become

contracting equation (8.3) with appropriate harmonics (6.2), one can split it into three

covariant equations

where

f i  umunifmn,

are contractions of the antisymmetric tensor eld (gauge eld strength) with the harmonics
(6.2).

the l.h.s. of the rst equation (8.4) has support on the string world volume m1+1, while its
r.h.s and all the equations (8.5), (8.6) have support on the boundary of the string worldsheet
m1+1 only.

an important observation is that the requirement for the superstring to have a nontrivial
boundary m1+1 6= 0 implies a specic restriction for the image of the gauge eld strength on
the boundary of the string worldsheet

m1+1 6= 0



f ++ |m1+1  um++ unfmn|m1+1 = 2.

(8.8)

eqs. (8.8) can be regarded as boundary conditions for the superd9brane gauge elds on
1-dimensional defects provided by the endpoints of the fundamental superstring. such boundary
conditions describe a phase of the coupled system where the open superstring interacts with the
d9-brane gauge elds through its endpoints.

however, the most general phase, which implies no restrictions (8.8) on the image of the
gauge eld, is characterized by equations dj8  e = 0, dj8  e++ = 0 and dj8 = 0. this
means the conservation of the superstring current and thus implies that the superstring is closed

f ++ |m1+1 6= 2  dj8 = 0  m1+1 = 0.

(8.9)

the equations decouple and become the equations of the free d9brane and the ones of the free
closed type iib superstring.

hence to arrive at the equations of a nontrivially coupled system of superd9brane and open
fundamental superstring we have to consider phases related to special boundary conditions for
the gauge elds on the string worldvolume or its boundary. the weakest form of such boundary
conditions are provided by (8.8).

below we will describe some interesting phases characterized by the boundary conditions
formulated on the whole superstring worldsheet, but before that some comments on the issues
of symmetry and supersymmetry seem to be important.

26

8.2 issues of symmetry and supersymmetry

8.2.1 on symmetry

if one considers the eld variation of the form (3.30), (3.31) for the free d9-brane -symmetry
transformation, one nds that they describe a gauge symmetry of the coupled system as well, if
the parameter  is restricted by boundary conditions on the two dimensional defect (superstring
worldsheet)

(x())  () = 0.

(8.10)

thus we have a counterpart of the -symmetry inherent to the host brane (d9-brane) in the
coupled system. as the defect (string worldsheet) is a subset of measure zero in 10-dimensional
space (d9-brane world volume) we still can use this restricted symmetry to remove half of
the degrees of freedom of the fermionic elds all over the d9-brane worldvolume except for the
defect.

at the level of noether identities this restricted symmetry is reected by the fact that

the half of the fermionic equations (7.27) has nonzero support on the worldsheet only.

for a system of low-dimensional intersecting branes and open branes ending on branes,
which does not include the superd9brane or other spacetime lling brane we will encounter
an analogous situation where the symmetries related to both branes should hold outside the
intersection.

however, we should note that, in the generic case (8.1), all the 32 variations of the grassmann
coordinates result in nontrivial equations. thus we have no true counterpart of the free brane
-symmetry. let us recall that the latter results in the dependence of half of the fermionic
equations of the free superbrane. it is usually identied with the part (one-half) of target space
supersymmetry preserved by the bps state describing the brane (e.g. as the solitonic solutions
of the supergravity theory).

8.2.2 bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom and supersymmetry of the decou-

pled phase

as the general phase of our coupled system (8.1), (8.9) describes the decoupled superd9brane
and closed type iib superstring, it must exhibit the complete d = 10 type iib supersymmetry.
supersymmetry (in a system with dimension d > 1) requires the coincidence of the numbers
of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. we nd it instructive to consider how such a
coincidence can be veried starting from the action of the coupled system, and to compare the
verication with the one for the case of free branes.

in the free superd9brane case the 32 fermionic elds i can be split into 16 physical and
16 unphysical (pure gauge) ones. for our choice of the sign of the wess-zumino term (3.7) they
can be identied with 2 and 1, respectively.

then one can consider the equations of motion (3.28) as restrictions of the physical degrees
of freedom (collected in 2), while the pure gauge degrees of freedom ( 1) can be removed
completely by symmetry (3.30), i.e. we can x a gauge 1 = 0 (see [40]).

27

a similar situation appears when one considers the free superstring model, where one can
identify the physical degrees of freedom with the set of 1q = 1v  q , 2+
q (4.25),
q , 2q = 2v  q , are pure gauge degrees of
while the remaining components 1+
freedom with respect to the -symmetry whose irreducible form is given by (4.16) (see (4.24)).

q = 1v +

q = 2v +

to calculate the number of degrees of freedom we have to remember that

 pure gauge degrees of freedom are removed from the consideration completely,
 the solution of second order equations of motion (appearing as a rule for bosonic elds, i.e.
x i() = x i(, ) (4.25)) for n physical variables (extracted e.g. by xing all the gauges)
is characterized by 2n independent functions, which can be regarded as initial data for
coordinates ( x i(0, )) and momenta (or velocities  x i(0, )),

 the general solution of the rst order equations (appearing as a rule for fermions, e.g.
q (, )) is characterized by only n functions, which can be identied with
q (0, )) which are identical to their momenta

1q (, ), 2+
the initial data for coordinates ( 1q (0, ), 2+
in this case.

in this sense it is usually stated that n physical (non pure gauge) elds satisfying the second
order equations of motion carry n degrees of freedom (e.g. for x i() n = (d  2) = 8), while
n physical elds satisfying the rst order equations of motion carry n/2 degrees of freedom (e.g.
for 1q (, ), 2+
q (, ) n/2 = 2(d  2)/2 = 16/2 = 8). this provides us with the same value
8 for the number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom for both the free superd9brane
and the free type ii superstring (8b + 8f ).

if one starts from the action of a coupled system similar to (6.6), the counting should be
performed in a slightly dierent manner, because, as it was discussed above, we have no true
symmetry in the general case. we still count 8 physical bosonic degrees of freedom related to
the superd9brane gauge eld am(x) living in the whole bulk (superd9brane worldvolume),
and 8 physical bosonic degrees of freedom living on the defect (superstring worldsheet) related
to the orthogonal oscillations of the string x i().

the 32 fermionic coordinate elds 1(x), 2(x) are restricted here by two sets of 16 equa-
tions (7.26), (7.27), with one set (7.26) involving the elds in the bulk (and also the source term
with support on the worldsheet) and the other (7.27) with support on the worldsheet only.

as the eld theoretical degrees of freedom are related to the general solution of homogeneous
equations (in the light of the correspondence with the initial data described above), the presence
(or absence) of the source with local support in the right hand part of the coupled equations is
inessential and we can, in analogy with the free d9-brane case, treat the rst equation (7.26)
as the restriction on 16 physical fermionic elds (say 2(x)) in the bulk. as mentioned above,
the coupled system has a d9-brane-like symmetry with the parameter (x) restricted by the
requirement that it should vanish on the defect ()   (x()) = 0. thus we can use this
kappa symmetry to remove the rest of the 16 fermionic elds (say 1(x)) all over the bulk
except at the defect.

28

thus all over the bulk including the defect we have 8 bosonic elds, which are the components
of am(x) modulo gauge symmetries and 8 = 16/2 fermionic elds, which can be identied with
the on-shell content of 2(x).

on the defect we have in addition the 16 components 1(), which are restricted (in the
general case) by 16 rst order equations (8.1) (or (4.21), (4.22)) and, thus, carry 8 degrees of
freedom. this is the same number of degrees of freedom as the one of the orthogonal bosonic
oscillations of superstring x i() = x m()ui
m(). this explains why our approach to the coupled
system allows to describe a decoupled supersymmetric phase.

it should be remembered (see section 3.4) that the presence of boundaries breaks at least

half of the target space supersymmetry.

8.3 phases implying restrictions on the gauge elds

as mentioned in section 8.1, the open fundamental superstring can be described only when
some restrictions on the image of the gauge eld are implied. the simplest restriction is given
by eq. (8.8). but it is possible to consider the phases where (8.8) appears as a consequence of
stronger restrictions which hold on the whole defect (string worldvolume), but not only on its
boundary.

an interesting property of such phases is that there an interdependence of the fermionic
equations of motion emerges. such a dependence can be regarded as an additional weak
counterpart of the -symmetry of the free superbrane actions.

8.3.1 phases with less than 8 dependent fermionic equations

the dependence of fermionic equations arises naturally when the matrix hpq is degenerate:

det(hqp) = 0



rh  rank(hqp) < 8

then hqp may be represented through a set of 8  rh rectangular matrices s i
rh < 8,

i = 1, . . . rh,

q, p = 1, . . . 8,

q s i
p ,

q

hqp = ()s i

(8.11)

(8.12)

and eq. (7.30) implies only rh < 8 nontrivial relations

0 < rh < 8



e  e2+

q s i

q = 0,

i = 1, . . . rh,

(8.13)

while the remaining 8  rh fermionic equations are dependent.

the general solution of eq. (8.13) diers from the expression for the fermionic equations of
the free superstring e  e2+
q = 0 by the presence of (8  rh) arbitrary fermionic two-forms
(actually functions, as on the worldsheet any two-form is proportional to the volume e++ e)
(8.14)

i = 1, . . . rh

q = 0.

(8.15)

on the other hand, due to eqs. (8.14), (8.12), the r j

j
p = 0

(8.16)

thus, they may be used to write down the explicit form of the 8  rh dependent fermionic
equations

rank(hqp) = rh < 8

q (cid:17) hqpr

j

(8.17)

8.3.2 nonperturbative phase with 8 dependent fermionic equations.

the case with the maximal number 8 of dependent fermionic equations appears when the matrix

hqp vanishes at the defect (hqp = 0). as the complete matrix h
 (7.33), (3.20), (3.21) is
lorentz group valued (3.19) and, hence, nondegenerate (det(h
 ) 6= 0), this implies that both
antidiagonal 8  8 blocks hq p , h++


det(hq p ) 6= 0,

qp are nondegenerate

qp ) 6= 0.

hqp = 0,

det(h++



(8.18)

in this case the fermionic equations (7.29) are satised identically and thus we arrive at
the system of 16 + 8 = 24 nontrivial fermionic equations. the dependence of eq. (7.29) for
the gauge eld subject to the boundary conditions (8.18) (see (3.20), (3.21)) can be regarded
as a counterpart of 8 symmetries. thus it could be expected that ground state solutions
corresponding to the bps states preserving 1/4 (i.e. 8) of the 32 target space supersymmetries
should appear just in this phase.




 = 

it is important that the phase (8.18) is nonperturbative in the sense that it has no a weak
gauge eld limit. indeed, in the limit fmn  0 the spin-tensor h
(3.19), (3.20) should tend
q = pq (see appendix a), the same is true for the so(8)
to unity h
stensor hpq: hpq = pq + o(f ). thus the condition (8.18) cannot be obtained in the weak eld
limit. this reects the fact that nontrivial coupling of the gauge eld with string endpoints is
described by this phase.

another way to justify the above statements is to use (3.20), (3.21) with the triangle matrix

and the explicit so(1, 1)  so(8) invariant representation for matrices (see eq. (a.8) in the
appendix a) to nd that hpq = 0 implies (see appendix c)

f ++   um++ un fmn = 2.

(8.20)

thus we see again that there is no weak gauge eld limit, as the image of at least one of the
gauge eld strength components onto the string worldsheet has a nite value in the phase (8.18).
on the other hand, eq. (8.20) demonstrates that the condition (8.8) holds on the boundary of
the worldsheet. thus one can expect that this phase provides a natural possibility to describe
the nontrivial coupling of the open fundamental superstring with the d-brane gauge eld. as
we will prove below analysing the eld equations, this is indeed the case.

30

in the nonperturbative phase (8.18) one of the fermionic equations (7.30) is satised iden-
tically and thus we have only one nontrivial fermionic equation (7.29) on the string worldsheet.
using the consequences (7.9) of eq. (7.2) the 2-form equation (7.29) can be decomposed as

(8.21)

(8.22)

(8.23)

 q + e2 +
we nd that it contains eight 0-form fermionic equations

e++  e( e1

another version of eq. (8.22) is

in the linearized approximation with respect to all elds except for the gauge eld strength f

one should remember that the free superstring fermionic equations (4.21), (4.22) as well

has a nontrivial source localized on the superstring worldsheet. it is just proportional to the
expression which vanishes in the free superstring case and in the generic phase, but remains
nonzero in the phase (8.18).

in the present case the relations (8.8) hold (see eq. (8.20)). using these relations, straight-
forward but tedious calculations demonstrate that the projections of eqs. (7.24) for x m onto
the harmonics um vanish identically here (these are noether identities for reparametrization
symmetry on the superstring worldvolume), while the projection onto u i

m results in

j8  m i
where f ++i, f i and m i
2 are dened in eqs. (8.7) and (7.25) respectively. eq. (8.26) diers
from the one of the free superstring by the nonvanishing r.h.s., which has support on the bound-
ary of the string worldsheet and describes the interaction with super-d9-brane gauge elds.

the born-infeld equations has the form (7.22) (with (7.19), (7.18) taken into account) and

contains a nonvanishing source term dj8.

thus, as expected, the phase (8.18) describes the open fundamental superstring interacting
with the super-d9-brane. the ends of the superstring carry the charge of the super-d9-brane
gauge eld and provide the source for the supersymmetric born-infeld equation. note that the
source of the fermionic equations is localized on the whole worldsheet. this property is specic
for the system including a spacetime lling brane.

9 conclusion and outlook

in this paper we present the derivation of a complete set of supersymmetric equations for a
coupled system consisting of the superd9brane and the open fundamental superstring ending
on the d9-brane. to this end we construct a current distribution form j8 which allows to write
the action functional of superstring and d9-brane in similar forms, i.e. as an integral of a
10-form over the 10-dimensional space, after the grassmann coordinates of the superstring are
identied with the images of the grassmann coordinate elds of the superd9brane. we prove
supersymmetric invariance of j8.

the proposed way to construct the action for the coupled system of superstring and space
time lling brane requires the use of the moving frame (lorentz harmonic) actions [31, 14, 15] for
the superstring. the reason is that its lagrangian form (in distinction to the ones of the standard
action [20]) can be regarded as pullbacks of some d-dimensional dierential 2form and, thus,
the moving frame actions for the free superstring can be written easily as an integral over a d
dimensional manifold by means of the current density j8. just the existence of the moving frame
formulation may motivate the formal lifting of the lagrangian forms of the standard actions to
d dimensions and their use for the description of the interaction with spacetime lling branes
and/or supergravity (see [25] for bosonic branes).

we obtain a complete supersymmetric system of the equations of motion for the coupled sys-
tem of superstring and superd9brane. dierent phases of the coupled system are found. one
of them can be regarded as generic, but describes the decoupled system of the closed superstring
and the super-d9-brane, while one of the others corresponds to a singular and nonperturbative
boundary condition for the gauge eld on the worldsheet.
it describes the coupled system
of the open superstring interacting with the d9-branes and implies an interdependence of the
fermionic equations of motion which can be regarded as a weak counterpart of the (additional)
symmetry.

the method proposed in [22] and elaborated in this paper may also be applied to the con-
struction of the action for a coupled system containing any number n2 of fundamental super-
strings and any number n2k of type iib super-dp-branes (p = 2k  1) interacting with the
super-d9-brane. in the action of such a coupled system

x (r)m() = x m(cid:16)x(r)()(cid:17)



x(r)m() = xm(cid:16) x (r)m()(cid:17) .

(9.3)

the lagrangian form l2k of the rst order action for the free super-dp-brane with p = 2k can be
found in [32]. certainly the form of the interaction between branes, which can be introduced into
l(r)
2k by the boundary terms requires a separate consideration (e.g. one of the important points
is the interaction with the d9-brane gauge eld through the wess-zumino terms of dp-branes).
we hope to return to these issues in a forthcoming publication.

it is worth mentioning that the super-d9-brane lagrangian from l10 can be omitted form
the action of the interacting system without loss of selfconsistency (cf.
[22]). thus one may
obtain a supersymmetric description of the coupled system of fundamental superstrings and
lower dimensional super-dp-branes (p = 2k  1 < 9), e.g. to the system of n coincident super-
d3-branes which is of interest for applications to gauge theory [11, 12], as well as in the context
of the maldacena conjecture [49].

the only remaining trace of the d9-brane is the existence of a map (9.3) of the super-
dp-brane (p < 9) worldvolume into a 10-dimensional space whose coordinates are inert under a
type ii supersymmetry. thus the system contains an auxiliary all-enveloping 9-brane ( 9-brane
dominance). this means that we really do not need a space-time lling brane as a dynamical
object and, thus, may be able to extend our approach to the d = 10 type iia and d = 11
cases, where such dynamical branes are not known.

another interesting direction for future study is to replace the action of the space-time
lling brane by a counterpart of the group-manifold action for the corresponding supergravity
theory (see [50]). such an action also implies the map of a d-dimensional bosonic surface into
a space with d-bosonic dimensions, as the space time lling brane does. thus we can dene
an induced map of the worldvolumes of superstrings and lower branes into the ddimensional
bosonic surface involved in the group manifold action and construct the covariant action for the
coupled system of intersecting superbranes and supergravity.

33

in this respect the problem to construct the counterpart of a group-manifold actions for the
d = 10 type ii supergravity [51] and duality-symmetric d = 11 supergravity [32] seems to be
of particular interest.

for supersymmetric strings and branes we need to introduce the matrix v 
 which takes its
values in the double covering spin(1, d  1) of the lorentz group so(1, d  1) and provides
the (minimal) spinor representation of the pseudo-rotation whose vector representation is given
by the vector harmonics u (spinor lorentz harmonics [52, 46, 31]). the latter fact implies the
invariance of the gammamatrices with respect to the lorentz group transformations described
by u and v harmonics

appendix b. linearized bosonic equations of type i i b super-

string

here we present the derivation of the linearized bosonic equations (4.27) of the superstring from
the set of equations (4.19), (4.20).

in the gauge (4.24), (4.23) fermionic inputs disappear from eq. (4.20). moreover, in the
linearized approximation we can replace e by the closed form d (holonomic basis for the
space tangent to the worldsheet) and solve the linearized peterson-codazzi equations (a.17),
(a.18)

df ++i = 0,

dfi = 0

(b.1)

in terms of two so(8)vector densities k++i, ki = 0 (innitesimal parameters of the coset
so(1, 9)/[so(1, 1)  so(8)])

f ++i = 2dk++i,

fi = 2dki.

then the linearized form of the equations (4.19), (4.20) is

eq. (b.4) implies

dx i  ++dki  idk++i = 0,
di  dk++i  d++  dki = 0.

++k++i + ki = 0,

while the integrability conditions for eq. (b.3) are

di  dk++i + d++  dki = 0.



++k++i  ki = 0

hence we have

++k++i = ki = 0.

(b.2)

(b.3)

(b.4)

(b.5)

(b.6)

now, extracting, e.g. the component of (b.3) proportional to d++ and taking into account

(b.6) one arrives at

++x i = ++i++ki.

(b.7)

the  derivative of eq. (b.7) again together with eq. (b.6) yields a relation which includes
the x i eld only

++x i = ++i++ki = 0

(b.8)

and is just the free equation (4.27).
