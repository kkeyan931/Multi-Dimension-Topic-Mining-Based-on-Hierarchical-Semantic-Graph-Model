i. introduction

a very powerful mathematical technique, that is used in many areas of theoretical

physics, is the heat kernel expansion of a quadratic operator. it became very signicant

because it can help us to calculate quantum corrections in quantum eld theories and in

quantum gravity.

the transition amplitudes are calculated in terms of a perturbation expansion. if the

path integral has a saddle point then we can perform a functional taylor expansion around

it and keep the terms up to second order. saddle points are the solutions of the classical eld

equations which dominate the path integral. in this way we nd the one loop corrections as

a function of the determinant of the quadratic uctuations of the quantum elds.

the derivative expansion presented here extends the work of i. moss, d. toms and s.

poletti [3], [4]. their expansion is a modication of the heat kernel asymptotic expansion.

they expand in powers of covariant derivatives.

the derivative expansion method is very useful when we want to evaluate one loop

corrections, in cases where the background eld is not constant. this is indeed the situation

for the soliton solutions, as well for the tunneling rates where the instanton solution is a

function of the euclidean space coordinates. recently theories that predict non topological

soliton solutions have attracted the interest. similar expansions need to be performed in

order to study the fate of these non trivial time independent classical solutions when quantum

corrections are considered [6], [7], [8], [5].

a more general version of the derivative expansion method is developed. this can deal

with an extended number of operators, non diagonal in spacetime indices, covering all the

interesting ones in gauge eld theories. the new formalism can deal with all the gauge

choices, in t hooft gauge xing. it is thus very useful when we want to study the gauge

dependency of the various results.

2

ii. the derivative expansion

heat kernel expansions and the similar derivative expansions are useful when the back-

ground eld or elds are not homogeneous.

in the conventional estimations of the rst

quantum corrections, for example in the one loop eective action, we assume that the clas-

sical scalar eld (the vacuum expectation value) is constant. in the case that this is not

true, derivatives of the background eld do not vanish resulting in the appearance of extra

kinetic terms in the lagrangian. in this case we have to deal with second order operators

of the form

 = d2 + x

(1)

where d is the covariant derivative associated with the group symmetry and x a matrix in
the same space with the group structure.

the heat kernel k(x, x, t), (x represents a spacetime point and t a positive parameter)

is a quantity that helps to deal with the eigenvalues of the operator.

if un(x) are the

normalized eigenfunctions of the operator , with corresponding eigenvalues n , the heat

kernel can be expressed as

k(x, x, t) =xn

un(x)un(x)en t

it is related with another useful quantity, the generalized  function

in the following way :

(x,s) =

s
n

(x,s) =xn
(s)z 

1

dt ts1tr[k(x, x,t)]

0

(2)

(3)

(4)

for s > d/2, (with space dimensions d ). it can also continued analytically at s = 0. the

above dened functions k(x, x, t), (x,s) are useful in computing one loop quantum correc-

tions since the functional determinant of the relevant quadratic operator can be expressed

as:

3

with

det  =yn

n = exp(cid:20)z d4x  (x,0)(cid:21)

 (x,0) =

d(x,s)

ds

|s=0

(5)

(6)

the derivative expansion i closely follow, suggested in [4], is based on a dierent expan-

sion from that in eq. 2. the expansion can be written in powers of covariant or ordinary

derivatives

tr[k(x, x,t)] = (4t)d/2xi

ai(x,t)

(7)

where ai(x,t) is a function carrying i derivatives of x. the derivative expansion is a local

expansion which sums contributions of a given number of derivatives to all orders contrary

to the heat kernel expansion which sums dierent number of derivatives order by order

and therefore has, in some cases, worst infrared problems. these functions ai(x,t) can be

computed using the heat kernel equation expanded in the momentum space. the heat kernel

equation

can be written as

k = 

k
t

.
k

= 

z d4x (cid:2)k2 + x(k, x)(cid:3) k(x, x, t) eik(xx

where k(k, x, t) is the following transformation of k(x, x, t) ,

) = 


k (k, x, t)

k(k, x, t) =z d4x eik(xx

) k(x, x, t) .

(8)

(9)

(10)

we also expand in powers of usual derivatives

k(k, x, t) = k0(k, x, t)xn

an(k, x, t) , ao = 1,

x =xn

xn ,

(11)

where xn is the part of the quadratic terms carrying nth order derivatives or in other

words the nth order kinetic terms while x0 contains the mass terms. k0 is the part of the

4

heat kernel with no derivatives and an is the part of the heat kernel that carries nth order

derivatives divided by k0.

we can now express the functions an(x, t) in terms of the new dened functions an.

from expressions eq. 7, eq. 10 we get

xi

ai(x,t) =(4t)d/2 trz d4xz d(k) k(k, x, t) eik(xx
an(x, t) = (4t)d/2z d(k) tr[k0(k, x,t) an(k, x, t)]

)(x  x) 

(12)

the next step is to develope an iterative scheme which will give the rst terms of the

expansion, in powers of covariant or ordinary derivatives of the relevant operator.

iii. generalized method

in the previous section we described the rst common steps between the derivative ex-
pansion method developed previously [3], [4], for operators of the form  = 2 + x ,
and the generalized method presented here. the old method is not applicable in the case

of some quadratic operators we encounter in gauge eld theories. the reason is that in

dierent gauges than the feynman one, we get operators of the following form

 = 

2 + (1  1) + x



(13)

the material below is a generalization of the derivative expansion method in order to handle

the quadratic operators in t hooft gauge xing. we avoid describing in great detail the

derivation of the various expressions. the reason is that the algebra is too lengthy to be

presented.

the heat kernel equation of the above operator can be written in the momentum space,
after a taylor expansion of x(k, x) , in powers of x  x  x  x around x(k, x), as
follows

finally after considerable cancellations, we nd through the expression eq. 12 that for

a t hooft gauge xing the rst terms of the derivative expansion are:

the term a1 does not contribute in the eective action, in our case, because leads to a total

divergence.

the above results in the feynman gauge  = 1 , reduce to the respective expressions, in [4].

we should ignore the spacetime indices if the operators do not carry such indices, otherwise

we should take in account them, assuming that the traces in the respective equations in [4],

are also over spacetime indices.

the above developed expansion formulae can also be given in a dierent and more lengthy

in our case form, using the covariant derivatives d instead of the simple derivatives  .
the above expansion can be carefully transformed in the covariant form in a similar way

with that proposed in [4].

note that

for  = 1

ek(t) = k ()(t)

and

and

ij(t) = ij(t) = ij(t) = 0

for  = 0

k ()(t) = 0

and

ij(t) = ij(t) = ij(t) = 0

note that one can prove, in order to test the validity of the developed expansion, that the

derivative of the corrected eective action with respect to the  parameter, evaluated at

 = 1, is zero. thus small deviations from the feynman gauge leave the calculated corrected

action invariant, as one should expect.

b. finite temperature corrections

in some stages of the early universe evolution, we often expect the particles to be in

thermal equilibrium. therefore a eld  can be in contact with this heat bath. the result

is that it gets a temperature dependent mass. since we deal with an ensemble of particles

in thermal equilibrium, the background state in which we perform calculations is no longer

the ground state of the hamiltonian but a thermal bath at temperature t . to study this

situation is essential to use a statistical quantity, the nite temperature eective potential

v (, t ). this is the free energy density associated with the  eld. at t 6= 0 quantum
statistics is equivalent to euclidean quantum eld theory in a space which is periodic with

period  = 1/t along the imaginary time axis. thus we can write the partition function

z as

< (x), t = 0 | e h | (x), t = 0>

z =x
z d[ ] exp{z 

0

dz d3xl}

11

(52)

where the integral is periodic with period depending on the kind of statistics the particles

obey

bosons : ( = 0, x) = ( = , x)

f ermions : ( = 0, x) = ( = , x)

(53)

(54)

the elds here represent ensemble of particles in local thermal equilibrium. these ther-

mal averages vary over space. the short discussion we had, implies that the integral measure,

in momentum space, becomes

z d(k) f (ki, k0) 

1z d3k

(2)3 f(cid:18)ki,

xn=

2n + s



(cid:19)

(55)

where s = 0 for bosons and s = 1 for fermions. we need to calculate now the  (x,0) function

in order to nd the one loop corrections through the expression eq. 5. the  (x,s) can be

written as the sum of terms  

n(x,s) with dierent number n of derivatives.

 
n(x,s) =

1

(s)z 

0

dt ts1tr[k0an]

(56)

the above expression together with the developed expansion, see eq. 39, 41, contains all

the information needed to nd quantum corrections at nite temperature. the one loop

contribution, at nite temperature, is given by the following expression

(1) =

1

t z d3x (cid:20)

(x, 0)(cid:21)

(57)

it is straightforward to nd, but lengthy to present, the temperature corrected expansion

in t hooft gauge. in the previous work [4] the temperature corrected expansion was given

in feynman gauge while here is given, for comparison, in landau gauge. the way we can

calculate this expansion for bosons and fermions is described in appendix a.

the new functions, we introduce, are given below, in the high temperature (m/t < 1)

regime and for bosons,

one should note here that, the nite temperature eective action is not well dened

because of the nonanalytic behavior of the two point functions involved. this problem

becomes manifest from the dierent results we get, taking dierent order of zero limits of

the four external momenta [17]. however it can give a correct approximate estimation of

the critical temperature. as far as the nature of the transition is concerned, something that

would be crucial for the cosmological electroweak phase transition [19], the various proposed

improved methods do not seem to agree [18].

iv. scalar electrodynamics

in this section we will apply as an example, the derivative expansion method we just

described, in the toy model of scalar electrodynamics. for loop corrections of this model see

[22], [21].

13

the lagrangian can be written as the sum of the physical and the ghost contributions.

the  dependence of both the kinetic and potential terms is profound. this dependence

should cancel out for a given solution that extremises the eective corrected action. such a

solution is the bubble one which is known only numerically.

v. full electroweak model

in order to convince the reader for the power and the range of applicability of the

described method we present the evaluation of second order derivative terms for the full

electroweak theory, around a non constant backgroung scalar eld. recent works, performing

derivative expansions, set the weinberg angle to zero [911], in order to simplify the group

structure of the quadratic operator.

the classical lagrangian for the higgs eld in the electroweak model is given by

ls = (d)(d) + 2  ()2.

with  the following su(2) doublet

 =

1

2

gauge covariant derivatives will be written in the form,

1 + i2

3 + i4



d =  

i
2

g a at a,

20

(109)

(110)

(111)

where

t a = a

for a = 1, 2, 3,

t a = t i

for a = 4.

(112)

the rst three generators are pauli matrices and the fourth is equal to the unit matrix i

multiplied by the tangent of the weinberg angle [12,13]. the su(2) coupling is g and the

u(1) one g .

t =

g
g

group indices will be raised with the metric 2ab and lowered with the metric 1

2ab.

we focus on one real component ,

 =

1

2  0
! ,

(113)

(114)

and calculate the eective action [].

the eective action will be expanded in powers of ,  and . first of all the eective

lagrangian including derivative terms up to second order can be expressed as [20],

l = 

1
2

z(, t )()2  v (, t ).

the  expansion takes the form,

z(, t ) = 1 + z (1)(, t )

v (, t ) = 

1
2

22 +

1
4

4 + v (1)(, t )

(115)

(116)

(117)

the radiative corrections to the eective potential are well known up to this order [14,15].

in the region of the potential where tunnelling is important the eective higgs mass is small

and the radiative corrections are dominated by the vector bosons and the top quark, [1,2].

21

a. zero temperature

we use an improved method for calculating the eective action which includes a quadratic

source [16]. this adds a term

k = 1v ()

(118)

to the higgs masses, making them positive, but does not change the vector boson mass

terms. at order , the eective action is given by

[] =

1
2

log det b  log det gh 

1
2

log det f 

1
2

tr(1

b k),

(119)

where b is the uctuation operator for the boson elds, gh for the ghosts and f for the

fermion elds.

the gauge is xed by the t hooft r gauge xing-functional f . we will use

fa =   aa +

i
2

g( ta  ta ).

the gauge-xing lagrangian is

lgf = 

1
2faf a

(120)

(121)

the cross term of the gauge-xing term ig (aa) ta  cancels a part of the cubic term

2ig()ta  aa that appears from the kinetic term with the covariant derivatives of the

scalar elds, after the symmetry breaking.

the quadratic term of the electroweak lagrangian can be written as

where

(124)

(125)

lets work out to nd the scalar quadratic term. the scalar quadratic part of the gauge

from this point on, we can calculate directly the expressions eq. 138, eq. 139 and after

some trivial algebra we nally compute, as in the previous chapter, the one loop corrections

from the extra kinetic and potential terms, eq. 107, eq.108, at zero temperature and in t

hooft gauge.

note that the ring corrections are the appropriate for this gauge choice.

fermions do not contribute at this order. the advantage of using the ring corrected

masses is that we get nite result for small values of the scalar eld  [9], [10]. the negativity

of the z (1), which is a signal of the breakdown of the pertubation theory happens for smaller

value of  compared with the previous results, [9], [10].

if we use the conventional approach of calculating the eective action, without including

a quadratic source, then we recover the expression in [9], using the plasma mass terms and

setting t = 0.

28

vi. final remarks

we developed this expansion method to cover uctuation operators appearing from a

general t hooft gauge xing. the superiority of these gauges is discussed in [23].

the aim of this work is to provide a powerful derivative expansion method that can be

used easily by other researchers in a wide range of lagrangians. an important feature of this

derivative expansion method is that it can handle complicated gauge groups. we applied as

an example this method in the su(2)  u(1) group structured model.

there is also another usefulness of the proposed method. quantum corrections to soliton

solutions can be found applying the developed derivative expansion technique.

as we have already pointed out the nite temperature results are only indicative and

performed for testing the method. the nonanalyticity of feynman amplitudes at high

temperatures make the derivative expansion not well dened [17]. widely accepted improved

results still are missing.

a2 is zero because the trace gives a function

proportional to k .

finally from eq. b5, eq. b14, eq. b19 after considerable cancellations, we nd through

the expression eq. 12 that in t hooft gauge the rst terms of the derivative expansion are

given by expression eq. 39, eq. 41.
