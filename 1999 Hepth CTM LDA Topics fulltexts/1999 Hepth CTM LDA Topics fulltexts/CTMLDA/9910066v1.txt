abstract.

we report on tests of the ads/cft correspondence that are made possible by
complete knowledge of the kaluzaklein mass spectrum of type iib supergravity
on ads5  t 11 with t 11 = su (2)2/u (1). after briey discussing general multiplet
shortening conditions in su (2, 2|1) and p su (2, 2|4) , we compare various types of short
su (2, 2|1) supermultiplets on ads5 and dierent families of boundary operators with
protected dimensions. the supergravity analysis predicts the occurrence in the scft
at leading order in n and gsn , of extra towers of long multiplets whose dimensions
are rational but not protected by supersymmetry.

superconformal eld theories from iib spectroscopy

1. introduction

one of the most stringent checks on the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] is the
matching between the mass spectrum of the kaluzaklein (kk) supergravity models
and the conformal dimensions of superconformal primary operators of the boundary
superconformal eld theory. this probes the correspondence at least in the regime
where gsn (gs being the string coupling) and/or n are large. after the strong support
provided by tests made for maximal supersymmetry, where the dynamics of n coincident
d3 branes (for large n) is related to type iib supergravity compactied on ads5  s5
[4], it is natural to consider lower supersymmetry, where a far richer structure of matter
multiplets leads to additional symmetries beside the original r-symmetry. alternatively
to orbifolding the sphere s5, a very interesting way to reduce supersymmetry is to

consider coset models such as t pq =

su(2)  su(2)

u(1)

(p and q dene the embedding

of the h = u(1) group into the two su(2) groups), which yield for p = q = 1 an
n = 2 supergravity theory with a matter gauge group g = su(2)  su(2) [5]. the
corresponding cf t4 description was constructed in [6, 7] as an n = 1 yangmills
theory with a avour symmetry g. one nds a conformal eld theory with singleton
degrees of freedom a and b, each a doublet of the factor groups su(2)su(2) and with
conformal anomalous dimension a,b = 3/4. the gauge group g is su(n)  su(n)
and the two singleton (chiral) multiplets are respectively in the (n, n) and (n , n) of
g. the gauge potentials lying in the adjoint of one of the two su(n) groups, whose
eldstrength in supereld notation is given by w, are singlet of the matter groups,
carry unit ur(1) charge and have  = 3/2.

there is also a superpotential [6] v = ijklt r(aibkajbl) with  = 3, r = 2
playing an important role in the discussion, since it determines to some extent both the
chiral spectrum and the marginal deformations of the scft.

chiral operators which are the analogue of the kk excitations of the su(n) n = 4
2 ) representation

yangmills theory is given by tr(ab)k with rcharge k and in the ( k
of su(2)  su(2) [6].

2 , k

more generally [8], there exist a complete correspondence between all the cft
operators and the kk modes for the conformal operators of preserved scaling dimension.
even more intriguingly, there exist other operators related to long multiplets but
having nonetheless nonrenormalised conformal dimension in the large n, gsn limit.
these seem to be the lowest dimensional ones for a given structure appearing in the
supersymmetric borninfeld action of the d3brane on ads5  t 11 [9].

it is now well known that states that are associated to shortened multiplets
of the superconformal algebra su(2, 2|n ) for the ads5/cf t4 duality,
in virtue of
supersymmetry have protected conformal dimensions. they are bps states from
the point of view of the bulk theory and shortened superelds from the boundary
perspective.

after this introduction, we present a brief review of the multiplet shortening

superconformal eld theories from iib spectroscopy

conditions for the su(2, 2|1) and p su(2, 2|4) superalgebras, while in section 3 we show
the results of the comparison between the dual ads and cft theories for the t 11
example.

2. group theory lore: uirs of su(2, 2|1) and p su(2, 2|4)

we rst consider the unitarity bounds for the highest-weight representations of the
su(2, 2|n ) superalgebra in the n = 1 and n = 4 cases, that are those relevant for the
analysis of the t 11 and the s5 iib compactications respectively .

for the su(2, 2) algebra itself, a given uir is denoted, following flato and frnsdal
[10], as d(e0, j1, j2) where e0, j1, j2 are the quantum numbers of the highest-weight
state, given by a nite uir of the maximal compact subgroup su(2)  su(2)  u(1).
the uirs fall in three series [11],

a) j1j2 6= 0

b) j2j1 = 0

c) j1 = j2 = 0

e0  2 + j1 + j2

e0  1 + j

e0 = 0 .

(1)

(2)

(3)

in the bulk interpretation,
the inequalities in a) and b) yield massive ads5
representations. their saturation gives rise to massless particles of spin j1 + j2 in
the case a) and to singletons of spin j for the b) threshold.

note that in the ads/cft map the bulk-boundary quantum numbers (e0, j1, j2)
refer to the compact basis for the ads states, while they refer to the non-compact basis
sl(2, c)  o(1, 1) for the boundary conformal operators [3, 12]. the highest weight
state in ads is related to a conformal operator o(x) at x = 0, and thus the ads energy
e0 becomes the conformal dimension 0 while the (j1, j2) labels give the lorentz spin
of o(x).

from the cft perspective, the threshold value for the bound a) represents a

conformal conserved currents of spin j = j1 + j2,

e0 = 2 + j1 + j2

(j1j2 6= 0)  1 1j1...2j1 , 1... 2j2 (x) = 0,

(4)

while for the bound b) one gets massless spin j conformal elds on the boundary,

e0 = 1 + j

(j 6= 0)

(j = 0)

 1 1o1...2j = 0
 2o(x) = 0.

(5)

the case c) gives rise to the identity representation.

generalising to the su(2, 2|n ) superalgebras [13, 14], the highest weight state
is denoted by d(e0, j1, j2; r, a1, ..., an 1), where the quantum numbers in brackets
indicates an uir of su(2, 2)  u(1)  su(n ), r lebelling the u(1) r-symmetry and
a1, ..., an 1 the dynkin labels of a uir of the non-abelian symmetry su(n ). we will
denote by r the u(1) generator inside u(n ).

note that for n 6= 4, the su(2, 2|n ) algebra is both a subalgebra and a quotient
algebra of u(2, 2|n ), since the supertrace generator (which is a central charge) can be

superconformal eld theories from iib spectroscopy

4

eliminated by a redenition of the r generator. however, this redenition is not possible
for n = 4 since inthat case r drops from the supersymmetry anti-commutators and
becomes an outer automorphism of the algebra [21].

therefore there are two inequivalent algebras (which do not include the r
generator), p su(2, 2|4) and p u(2, 2|4), depending on whether r = 0 or r 6= 0 (for
n = 4, r denotes the central charge.

since the n = 4 yangmills multiplet has r = 0, we will only consider p su(2, 2|4).
in the boundary cft language, where uirs can be realized as conformal superelds,
the superhighest weight state corresponds to a supereld (x, ) at x =  = 0
[14, 15, 25, 17].

the unitarity bounds for su(2, 2|1) were given in [10, 14, 18]. they generalize the

cases a), b) and c) of eq. (1) and read

a) e0  2 + 2j2 +

r  2 + 2j1

which implies

(or j1  j2, r  r) j1, j2  0(6)

and thus e0  1 + j. finally

c) e0 = j1 = j2 = r = 0

which is the identity representation.

shortening in the case a) takes place when

this is a semi-long ads5 multiplet or, in conformal language, a semiconserved supereld
[8, 19],

d 1l1...2j1 , 1... 2j2 (x, , ) = 0,

( d2l1...2j1 = 0 for j2 = 0)

(11)

(in our conventions  carries  = 1/2, r = 1,  has  = 1/2, r = 1).

maximal shortening for the bound a) happens for e0 = 2 + j1 + j2, r = j1  j2.

this is a conserved supereld which satises both left and right constraints:

d 1j1...2j1 , 1... 2j2 = d1j1...2j1 , 1... 2j2 = 0

(12)

further, shortening in b) corresponds to chiral superelds r = 2/3e0, while
maximal shortening to massless chiral superelds, i.e. chiral singleton representations:
e0 = 3

2r = 1 + j. the supereld, for e0 = 3

2r satises,

d s1...2j = 0

and, for e0 = 1 + j, it also satises

d1s1...2j = 0

(d2s = 0, for j = 0)

(13)

(14)

superconformal eld theories from iib spectroscopy

these equations are the supersymmetric version of (4) and (5).

with an abuse of language, we may call o-shell singletons chiral superelds since
in an interacting conformal eld theory singletons may acquire anomalous dimension,
and thus fall in (13).

it is also evident, from supereld multiplication, that by taking suitable products
of several free supersingletons one may get any other supereld of type (11), (12) or
(13).

one can remark that, since the shortening condition just implies a relation between
e0 and r without xing their value, superelds obeying (11), (13) may have anomalous
dimensions .

the basic singleton multiplets for n = 1 gauge theories arise for j = 0, 1/2 in (13),
i.e. chiral scalar superelds s (wess-zumino multiplets) and yang-mills eld strength
multiplets w. any other conformal operator is obtained by suitable multiplication of
these two sets of basic superelds.

in type iib supergravity on t 11 long, semi-long and chiral multiplets do indeed
occur [6, 20, 8]. chiral wz singleton multiplets have in this case an anomalous dimension
 = 1/4 ( = 1 + ) and r-symmetry r = 3/4.

the n = 4 superalgebra is of great interest because it corresponds to n = 4
superconformal yang-mills theory and lives, in the dual description, at the boundary
of ads5 [1, 2, 3]. the supergravity theory emerges as the low energy limit of type iib
string theory compactied on ads5s5.

the highest weight uirs of the p su(2, 2|4) superalgebra are denoted by

d(e0, j1, j2; p, k, q), where (p, k, q) are the su(4) dynkin labels.

there exist three classes of uirs

a)

e0  2 + j1 + j2 + p + k + q,

j2  j1

(p  q),

(15)

with maximal shortening occurring when,

massless bulk multiplets arise for p = k = q = 0 and j1 = j2.

(q  p).

(16)

(17)

(18)

maximal shortening occurs when 1 + j = 1
k, j, 0; p, k, p + 2 + 2j). no supersingletons appear in this series. finally,

2(q  p), with highest weight d(3 + 3j + 2p +

c )

e0 = 2p + k,

p = q,

j1 = j2 = 0.

(19)

the highest weight states are d(2p + k, 0, 0; p, k, p). the p = 0, k  2 uirs correspond
to the kk states of type iib on ads5  s5, the k = 2 case being associated with the

superconformal eld theories from iib spectroscopy

6

bulk graviton multiplet. the p = 0, k = 1 uir yields the only supersingleton of the
p su(2, 2|4) algebra [21, 22]. the innite sequence of uirs with p = 0, multiplets
with jm ax = 2 have been obtained in [23] with the oscillator construction. they are
associated with the harmonic holomorphic superelds of [24]. the case p 6= 0, which
may be relevant for multiparticles supergravity states, has been discussed in [16].

3. confronting with experiment

t pq = su(2)2/u(1) cosets are einstein spaces having n = 2 supersymmetry only when
the subgroup u(1) generator th = p3 + q3 is dened with p = q = 1, where 3, 3
are pauli matrices generating the two su(2) groups in the numerator. the u(1) r-
symmetry generator is tr = 3  3. since t 11 is topologically the product s2  s3,
it has nontrivial betti numbers b2 = b3 = 1, and therefore the full isometry group
is su(2, 2|1)  su(2)  su(2) with an extra ub(1) gauge symmetry related to the
existence of nontrivial three cycles [26].

knowing the fundamental degrees of freedom of the conformal eld theory, one
could try to write the conformal operators by simply combining the above elds while
respecting the symmetries of the theory. next to the already mentioned t r(ab)k chiral
primaries, one could also have an operator given by t r[w(ab)k] or t r[w 2(ab)k],
and so on. the important point is that the correspondence with the kk states is true
only for the protected operators, and thus one needs to know these latters to make the
comparison.

3.1. cft  ads

the operators with protected conformal dimension correspond to the
short
representation of the su(2, 2|1) supergroup described in the previous section. in our
case we have only three types of such operators, namely the chiral (13), conserved (12)
and semiconserved (11) superelds. since these elds satisfy certain specic constraints
eecting their quantum numbers, their anomalous dimension is also xed in terms of
their spin and rsymmetry charge.

it is easy to relate operators of dierent type by supereld multiplication. the
product of a chiral (j1, 0) and an antichiral (0, j2) primary gives a generic supereld
with (j1, j2),  = c + a and r = 2
3 (c  a). by multiplying a conserved
current supereld j1...2j1 , 1... 2j2 by a chiral scalar supereld one gets a semiconserved
supereld with  = c + 2 + j1 + j2 and r = 2

3(  2  2j2).

these are the basic rules to construct operators with protected dimensions beside
the chiral ones, and they also apply in superconformal eld theories of lower or higher
dimensions. for instance, beyond the chiral operators with  = r (hypermultiplets), in
d = 3 osp(2|4) superconformal eld theories one replaces the shortening condition (11)
by the simpler constraint

d1l1...2s(x, , ) = 0

s 6= 0

(20)

superconformal eld theories from iib spectroscopy

d2l(x, , )

= 0

s = 0,

7

(21)

dening semiconserved tensor operators (s = 0, 1
2, 1 in the kk context) with protected
dimensions  = 1+s+r (or r  r if   +). as before, l is obtained by multiplying
a conserved spin s supereld (for which both d+ and d constraints are satised) and
a chiral supereld.

since the anomalous dimensions of these operators is xed in terms of their spin
and rsymmetry, it must be given by rational number. this yields a very restrictive
condition when searching for the corresponding supergravity states, as it imposes strong
constraints on the allowed masses and matter group quantum numbers.

the ads/cf t correspondence provides a xed relation between the anomalous
dimension of the various elds at the boundary and the masses of the bulk states. a
result of our computations is that the requirement for the anomalous dimensions to be
rational implies that one must look for dual kk states having also rational masses .

the virtue of kk harmonic analysis on a coset space [28] hinges on the possibility
of reducing the computation of the mass eigenvalues of the various kinetic dierential
operators to a completely algebraic problem. harmonics are identied by g quantum
numbers, and they are acted upon by derivatives that are reduced to algebraic operators.
such elegant technique can be quite cumbersome for complicated cosets, but it is
quite straightforward for the simple t 11 manifold. indeed, it allows to go beyond the
computation of the scalar laplacian eigenvalues [20], or of specic sectors of the mass
spectrum [29].

after diagonalising dierent operators for elds of various spin, we have found that

all the masses have a xed dependence on the scalar laplacian eigenvalue

h0(j, l, r) = 6[j(j + 1) + l(l + 1)  1/8r2]

(22)

where (j, l, r) refer to the su(2)2 and rsymmetry quantum numbers. this is due to
the fact that on a rank one coset we have only one functionally independent laplace
beltrami operator.

the full analysis [30] reveals that the supergravity theory has one graviton multiplet

with conformal dimensions

four gravitino multiplets with

and four vector multiplets, with

(23)

 = 1 +ph0(j, l, r) + 4,
 = 1/2 +ph0(j, l, r  1) + 4,  = 5/2 +ph0(j, l, r  1) + 4, (24)
 = 2 +ph0(j, l, r) + 4,
 = 4 +ph0(j, l, r) + 4,
 = 1 +ph0(j, l, r  2) + 4.

(25)

 the above basic rules have been recently used in the ads/cft correspondence of some m theory
models compactied on ads4  x7 [27].

superconformal eld theories from iib spectroscopy

8

the above formulae clearly show that rational values of the conformal dimensions

occur when the square roots assume rational values

h0 + 4  q2.

this equation is found to admit some special solutions for

j = l = |r/2|,

j = l  1 = |r/2|

or

l = j  1 = |r/2|.

(26)

(27)

(28)

at this point we have some strong constraints on the possible su(2, 2|1) quantum
numbers as well as on the su(2)  su(2) ones. it is therefore an easy task to build
the conformal operators satisfying such constraints and nd the corresponding bulk
supermultiplets.

while referring to [8] for all details, we now show some interesting examples.
the chiral operators of the conformal eld theory are given by

sk = t r(ab)k

k = t r(cid:2)w 2(ab)k(cid:3)
t k = t r(cid:2)w(ab)k(cid:3)

(29)

(30)

(31)

and are shown to correspond to hypermultiplets containing massive recursions of the
dilaton or the internal metric (29 and 30) or to tensor multiplets (31).

more interesting are the towers of operators associated to the semiconserved

currents. some of them are given by the following operators

  = t r(wev w ev (ab)k),
j k
j k = t r(aev aev (ab)k),

(32)

(33)

which lead to short multiplets whose highest state is a spin 2 and spin 1 eld respectively,
with masses given by

mj k

 

=s 3

2

k(cid:18) 3

2

k + 4(cid:19),

and

mj k =s 3

2

k(cid:18) 3

2

k + 2(cid:19).

(34)

these bulk states correspond to massive recursion of the graviton and of the gauge
bosons of the matter groups.

it has been explained that under certain conditions the semiconserved superelds
can become conserved, and this is indeed the case.
if we set k = 0 we retrieve the
conserved currents related to the stressenergy tensor and the matter isometries . in
= mj 0 = 0 are the massless graviton and gauge bosons of the supergravity
fact mj 0
theory.

 

we have now checked the correspondence as far as what the conformal eld theory
predicts on the bulk states, but what can we learn on the cft from the analysis of the
supergravity states?

superconformal eld theories from iib spectroscopy

3.2. ads  cft

there are essentially two aspects of the supergravity theory which can give us new insight
in the dual cft. the rst is the existence of the socalled betti multiplets [31], which
give rise to additional symmetries of the boundary theory, and the other is the presence
of long multiplets with rational scaling dimensions, which could provide us with new
nonrenormalization theorems at least in the large n, gsn limit. let us now turn to the
rst aspect. the nontrivial b2 and b3 numbers of the t 11 manifold imply the existence
of closed nonexact 2form yab and 3-form yabc. these forms must be singlets under the
full isometry group, and thus they signal the presence of new additional massless states
in the theory than those connected to the su(2)  su(2)  ur(1) isometry.

from the kk expansion of the complex rank 2 am n and real rank 4 am n p q tensors
of type iib supergravity we learn that we should nd in the spectrum a massless vector
(from aabc), a massless tensor (from aab) and two massless scalars (from aab). this
implies the existence of the so called betti vector, tensor and hypermultiplets, the last
two being a peculiar feature of the ads5 compactication. the additional massless
vector can be seen to be the massless gauge boson of an additional ub(1) symmetry of
the theory.

from the boundary point of view we need now to nd an operator counterpart for
such a vector multiplet and seek an interpretation of the additional symmetry. the task
of nding the conformal operator is very easy, once we take into account that it must
be a singlet of the full isometry group and must have  = 3. the only operator we can
write is [8, 32]

u = t r aev aev  t r bev bev

(d2u = d2u = 0),

(35)

which represents the conserved current of a baryon symmetry of the boundary theory
under which the a and b eld transform with opposite phase. we have shown that the
occurrence of such betti multiplets is indeed due to the existence of nontrivial two and
threecycles on the t 11 manifold. this implies that, from the stringy point of view, we
can wrap the d3branes of type iib superstring theory around such 3cycles and the
wrapping number coincides with the baryon number of the lowenergy cft [32].

we nish by commenting on the second ads prediction on the cft. we have shown
that the conformal operators with protected dimension are given by chiral ones or by
their products with the conserved currents. the surprising output of the supergravity
analysis is that there exist some long operators (not protected by supersymmetry) which
have rational conformal dimension.

if we take for example the chiral operator t r(w 2(ab)k), we can make it nonchiral
by simply inserting into the trace an antichiral combintation of the gauge eldstrength
t r(w 2ev w 2ev (ab)k). this operator then corresponds to a long multiplet in the bulk
theory and one should expect its scaling dimension to be renormalized to an irrational
number. if we search for the corresponding vector multiplet in the supergravity theory,
we see that its anomalous dimension is instead rational and matches exactly the naive
sum of the dimensions of the operators inside the trace. from our analysis this appears

superconformal eld theories from iib spectroscopy

10

to be the case for all the lowest nonchiral operators of general towers with irrational
scaling dimension. for instance, the towers of operators

t r(cid:2)w(aev aev )n(ab)k(cid:3)
t r(cid:2)ev w ev (aev aev )n(ab)k(cid:3)

have an irrational value of  for generic n, but when n = 1 we have found that they
do have rational anomalous dimension  = 5/2 + 3/2k. when n = 0 we retrieve the
chiral, or semiconserved operators with protected .
