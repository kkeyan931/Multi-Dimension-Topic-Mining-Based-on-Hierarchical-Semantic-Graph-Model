abstract

the general method of the reduction in the number of coupling parameters is dis-
cussed. using renormalization group invariance, theories with several independent
couplings are related to a set of theories with a single coupling parameter. the
reduced theories may have particular symmetries, or they may not be related to
any known symmetry. the method is more general than the imposition of invari-
ance properties. usually, there are only a few reduced theories with an asymptotic
power series expansion corresponding to a renormalizable lagrangian. there also
exist general solutions containing non-integer powers and sometimes logarithmic
factors. as an example for the use of the reduction method, the dual magnetic
theories associated with certain supersymmetric gauge theories are discussed. they
have a superpotential with a yukawa coupling parameter. this parameter is ex-
pressed as a function of the gauge coupling. given some standard conditions, a
unique, isolated power series solution of the reduction equations is obtained. after
reparametrization, the yukawa coupling is proportional to the square of the gauge

1. introduction.

the method of reduction in the number of coupling parameters [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [11] has found many theoretical and phenomenological applications.

it is a very general method, based essentially upon the requirement of renormaliza-
tion group invariance of the original multi-parameter theory, as well as the related

reduced theories with fewer couplings. combining the renormalization group equa-
tions of original and reduced theories, we obtain a set of reduction equations. these

are dierential equations for the removed couplings considered as functions of the
remaining parameters. they are necessary and sucient for the independence of
the reduced theories from the normalization mass. we consider massless theories,

or mass independent renormalization schemes, so that no mass parameters appear
in the coecient functions of the renormalization group equations. this can be

arranged, provided the original coecient functions have a well dened zero-mass
limit [12].

in this paper, we discuss only reductions to a single coupling, which covers
most cases of interest. usually, we can choose one of the original couplings as the

remaining parameter. the multi- parameter theory is assumed to be renormalizable
with an asymptotic power series expansion in the weak coupling limit. however the
reduced theories, as obtained from the reduction equations, may well not all have

such expansions in the remaining coupling. non- integer powers and logarithms
can appear, often with undetermined coecients. such general solutions do not

correspond to conventional renomalized power series expansions associated with
a lagrangian. but they are still well dened in view of their embedding in the

renormalized multi-parameter theory. nevertheless, it is the relatively small number
of uniquely determined power series solutions of the reduction equations, which is

of primary interest. depending upon the character of the system considered, there
may be additional requirements which further reduce the number of these solutions.
although we consider renormalizable theories, with appropriate assumptions, the

reduction method can also be applied in cases where the original theory is non-
renormalizable.

regular reparametrization is a very useful tool in connection with the reduction
method. for theories with two or more coupling parameters, it is not possible

to reduce the -function expansions to polynomials. however, in the reductions
to one coupling, we can usually remove all but the rst term in the power series

2

solutions of the reduction equation with determined coecients. the -functions
of the corresponding reduced theories remain however innite series. as seen from
many examples, these reparametrizations lead to frames which are very natural for

the reduced theories.

the imposition of a symmetry on the multi-parameter theory is a conventional

if there appear no anomalies, we get a
way of relating the coupling parameters.
renormalizable theory with fewer parameters so as to implement the symmetry.

these situations are all included in the reduction scheme, but our method is more
general, leading also to unique power series solutions which exhibit no particular
symmetry. this situation is illustrated by an example we have included. an su(2)

gauge theory with matter elds in the adjoint representation. besides the gauge
coupling, there are three additional couplings. with only the gauge coupling re-

maining after the reduction, we get two acceptable power solutions. one of the
reduced theories is an n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory, while the other solution

leads to a theory with no particular symmetry.

the main example presented in this article is connected with duality [13, 14,

15, 16]. we consider n = 1 supersymmetric qcd (sqcd) and the corresponding
dual theory, magnetic sqcd. the primary interest is in the phase structure of the
physical system described by these theories. essential aspects of this phase structure

were rst obtained on the basis of supercovergence relations and brst methods
[13, 15]. we exhibit the
[17, 18, 19], and more recently with the help of duality.

quantitative agreement of both approaches [20, 21]. while duality is formulated only
in connection with supersymmetry, the supercovergence arguments can be used also

for qcd and similar theories [18, 19], [22]. of particular interest is the transition
point at nf = 3
2 nc for sqcd [17, 15], where nf and nc are the numbers of
avors and colors respectively. it is the lower end of the conformal window. for
smaller values of nf , the quanta of free, electric sqcd are conned, the system
is described by free magnetic excitations of the dual theory (for nc > 4), and
eventually by mesons and baryons. (the corresponding transition point for qcd is
given by nf = 13

4 nc ).

as the original theory, sqcd has only the gauge coupling ge. the dual theory
is constructed on the basis of the anomaly matching conditions [13, 15]. it involves
the two coupling parameters gm and 1, where 1 is a yukawa coupling associated
with a superpotential. this potential is required by duality, mainly since theories,

3

which are dual to each other, must have the same global symmetries.

m) = g2

at rst, we apply the reduction method to the magnetic theory in the conformal
window 2
3nc < nf < 3nc [21, 23]. we nd two power series solutions. after
reparametrization, one solution is given by 1(g2
mf (nc, nf ), with f being a
known function of the numbers of colors and avors for sqcd. the other solution is
1(g2
m)  0. since the latter removes the superpotential, it is excluded, and we are
left with a unique single power solution. this solution implies a theory with a single
gauge coupling gm, and renormalized perturbation expansions which are power series
in g2
m. it is the appropriate dual of sqcd. there are general solutions, but they all
approach the excluded power solution 1(g2)  0. with one exception, they involve
non-integer powers of g2
m. the reduction can be extended to the free electric region
nf > 3nc, and to the free magnetic region nc + 2 < nf < 2
3nc, (nc > 4). the
results are similar, and discussed in detail in [23]. in the free magnetic case, we deal
however with the approach to a trivial infrared xed-point.

possible connections of the reduction results with features of brane dynamics remain
to be considered. internal uctuations of branes may be of relevance for the eld

theory properties obtained here.

2. reduction equations

we consider renormalizable quantum eld theories with several coupling param-

eters. it is assumed that there is a mass-independent renormalization scheme, so
that no mass parameters occur in the coecient functions of the renormalization
group equations. let , 1, . . . , n be n + 1 dimensionless coupling parameters of
the theory. one can reduce this system in various ways, but we want to consider

the parameter  as the primary coupling, and express the remaining n couplings as
functions of :

k = k(),

k = 1, . . . , n .

(1)

it is assumed, that these functions k() are independent of the renormalization
mass , which can always be arranged.

the greens functions g (ki, 2, , 1, . . . , n) of the original multi-parameter
version of the theory satisfy the usual renormalization group equations with the
coecient functions , k, and the anomalous dimension g, which depend upon
the n + 1 coupling parameters. the corresponding greens functions of the reduced

4

theory are given by

g(ki, 2, ) = g(cid:16)ki, 2, , 1(), . . . , n()(cid:17) .

renormalization group invariance requires that they satisfy the equation

 2 

2 + ()




+ g()! g(ki, 2, ) = 0 ,

(2)

(3)

where () and g() are given by the corresponding original coecients with the
insertions k = k(),
k = 1, . . . , n . comparison of eq.(3) with the original
multi-parameter renormalization group equation implies then

()

dk()

d

= k() ,

k = 1, . . . , n

(4)

these are the reduction equations, which are necessary and sucient for the validity

of eq.(3).

it is of interest to briey consider the relationship between the reduction method
as described above, and the equations for the eective coupling functions (u), k(u),
where u is the dimensionless scaling parameter u = k2/2. these functions satisfy
the equations

u

d
du
dk
du

u

= (, 1, . . . , n) ,

= k(, 1, . . . , n) .

(5)

with (u) being an analytic function, we can choose a point where (d(u)/du) 6= 0
and introduce (u) as a new variable eqs.(5,6). the result is again the reduction
equations (4).

with eective couplings, we study the multi-parameter theory at dierent mass

scales. in the reduction method, we consider the set of dierent eld theories with
one coupling parameter (or a reduced number), which can be obtained from a given

multi-parameter theory as solutions of the reduction equations. the elements of
this set are labeled by the free parameters of the solution, and all are considered at

the same xed mass scale. with some natural assumptions the number of theories
in this set is usually smaller than the number of original coupling parameters, and
the dierent theories have characteristic physical and mathematical features. this

is best seen in examples, some of which we discuss below. it must be remembered,

5

that the origin of the coupling parameter space is a singular point, so that the
picard-lindeloef theorem about the uniqueness of solutions at regular points does
not apply.

as described so far, the reduction scheme is very general, but in practice we
usually know the -functions only as asymptotic expansions in the small coupling

limit. within the framework of renormalized perturbation theory, we restrict our-
selves here to expansions of the form

(, 1, . . . , n) = 02 + ( 13 + 1kk2 + 1kkkk )

(6)

in writing the expansions (6), we have assumed that the primary coupling  is
chosen such that (0, 1, ..., n) = 0.

with the original -functions given as asymptotic power series expansions, we
will consider in the following solutions k() of the reduction equations, which are
also of the form of asymptotic expansions. of special interest are solutions which are

power series expansions. but in general, non-integer powers as well as logarithmic
terms are possible.

3. power series solutions

let us rst consider solutions of the reduction equations (4) which are asymptotic
power series expansions. then the greens functions g(ki, 2; ) of the reduced
theory have power series expansions in  and are associated with a corresponding
renormalizable lagrangian. it is reasonable to write

k() = fk(),

k = 1, . . . , n ,

(7)

where the functions fk() are bounded for   0 so that k(0) = 0. according to the
reduction equations, if we had k(0) 6= 0, the vanishing of (0, 1(0), ..., n(0)) would
imply that also k(0, 1(0), ..., n(0)) vanishes, which is too strong a restriction and
not fullled by eq.(6). in terms of the functions fk() the reduction equations are

6

of the form

 

dfk
d

+ fk! = k ,

where we have introduced the -functions



() = (, f1, . . . , fn) =

k() = k(, f1, . . . , fn) =

(8)

(9)

(10)

n(f )n+2 ,

(n)
k (f )n+2 .



xn=0
xn=0

here the argument f stands for f1(), . . . , fn(). the coecients are easily obtained
from eqs.(6). for example, the one-loop terms are given by

0(f ) = 0,

(0)
k (f ) = c(0)

k + c(0)

kkfk + c(0)

kkkfkfk .

for the functions fk(), we write the expansions

fk() = f 0

k +

(m)
k m ,



xm=1

(11)

(12)

and insert them, together with the series (9) and (10), into the reduction equations.
at the one-loop level, there result then the relations

or in explicit form using eq.(11),

k(f 0)  f 0

k 0) = 0 ,

c(0)
k + (c(0)

kk  0kk)f 0

k + c(0)

kkkf 0

kf 0

k = 0 .

(13)

(14)

these are the fundamental formulae for the reduction.

given a solution f 0

k of the quadratic equations (14), we obtain for the expansion

coecients (m)

k

the relations

(cid:16)mkk(f 0)  m0kk(cid:17) (m)

k = (cid:16)m(f 0)f 0

k  (m)

k

(f 0)(cid:17) + x (m)

k

where m = 1, 2, . . . ,

k = 1, . . . , n . the matrix m(f 0) is given by

mkk(f 0) = c(0)

k,k + 2c(0)

k,kkf 0

k  kk0 .

,

(15)

(16)

the rest term x (m) depends only upon the coecients (1), . . . , (m1), and upon
the function coecients in (9) and (10), evaluated at fk = f 0
k , for order m  1
and lower. they vanish for (1) = . . . = (m1) = 0.

7

we see that the oneloop criteria

det(cid:16)mkk(f 0)  m0kk(cid:17) 6= 0 f or m = 1, 2, . . .

(17)

are sucient to insure that all coecients (m) in the expansion (12) are determined.
then the reduced theory has a renormalized power series expansion in . all possible
solutions of this kind are determined by the oneloop equation (13) for f 0
k .

with the coecients (m) xed, we can use regular reparametrization trans-
formations in order to remove all but the rst term in the expansion (12) of the
functions fk(). these reparametrization transformations are of the form

 = (, 1, . . . , n) =  + a(20)2 + a(11)
k = 


k(, 1, . . . , n) = k + b(20)

kkkkk + b(11)

k k +   

,

kk k +    .

they leave invariant the one-loop quantities

k , 0(f 0), (0)
f 0

k (f 0), mkk(f 0) .

given the condition (17), we then have a frame where

k() = f 0

k .

(18)

(19)

(20)

this result is valid to all orders of the asymptotic expansion and determined by
one-loop information. with the expressions (20), the -function expansions (9) and
(10) of the reduced theory have constant coecients m(f 0), (m)
(f 0), but they are
generally not polynomials. they satisfy the relations

k

(m)
k

(f 0)  f 0

k m(f 0) = 0.

(21)

for all values of m. only the relations for m = 0 are reparametrization invariant.

they are the fundamental formulae (13).

so far, we have implicitly assumed that f 0

k 6= 0. but it is straightforward to
include the cases where f 0
k = 0. they are of particular interest for supersymmetric
theories. suppose we have a solution of the reduction equations with the asymptotic
expansion

fk() = (n )

k n +



xm=n +1

(m)
k m ,

(22)

8

where n  1 and (n )
6= 1. then coecients appearing in this equation are
again determined except for the rst one, which is invariant. hence, using regular

k

reparametrization, there is a frame where

fk() = (n )

k n .

(23)

we have considered here only expansions at the origin in the space of coupling
parameters. however, one can use the method also in connection with any non-

trivial xed point of the theory.

2. general solutions

at rst, let us briey consider the case where the determinant appearing in
eq.(17) vanishes. suppose there is a positive eigenvalue of the matrix  1
0 m(f 0)
for some m = n  1, 0 6= 0. then the asymptotic power series must be supple-
mented by terms of the form m(lg)p, with m  n and 1 < p < (n). after
reparametrization, we obtain then an expansion of the form

fk() = f 0

k + (n,1)

k

n lg  + (n )

k n + . . .

,

(24)

all parameters in eq.(24) are determined except the vector (n )
, which contains as
many free parameters as the degeneracy of the eigenvalue. even though the theory
considered here can have logarithmic terms in the asymptotic expansion, it is renor-

k

malized in view of its embedding into the original, renormalized multi-parameter
theory. in special cases it may happen that the coecients of the logarithmic terms

vanish, as in the example of the massless wess-zumino model.

we now return to systems with non-vanishing determinant for all values of m. in

addition to the power series solutions described before, there can be general solutions
of the reduction equations, which approach the latter asymptotically. in order to
describe a characteristic case, we assume that 0 6= 0 and that the matrix  1
0 m(f 0)
has one positive eigenvalue  which is non-integer, with all others being negative.
then the reduction equations (4) have solutions of the form

fk() = f 0

k +xa,b

(a+b)
k

a+b +xm

(m)
k m

(25)

with a = 1, 2, . . . , b = 0, 1, . . . , a + b = non-integer. after reparametrization,

powers with m <  are removed, and we have

fk() = f 0

k + ()

k  + . . . .

(26)

9

in this expansion all coecients are determined except ()
to r arbitrary parameters if the eigenvalue  is r-fold degenerate:

k , which may contain up

()
k = c1(1)

k + . . . + cr(r)

k

,

(27)

where the (i)

k are the eigenvectors.

the results described above can be generalized to situations with several positive,
non-integer eigenvalues. in special cases, where the matrix also has a zero eigenvalue,

logarithmic factors may appear.

so far, we have assumed that 0 6= 0, and obtained general solutions which
approach the power series solution (20) asymptotically with a power law as indicated
in eq.(26). the situation is quite dierent if 0 = 0. then th matrix m is given by

mkk(f 0) = 


(0)

k (f )

fk 
0

(28)

and we nd that the general solutions and the power series solutions dier asymp-

totically by terms which vanish exponentially. we refer to [2] for more details.

besides the general solutions, which approach the power series solutions asymp-
totically, there can be others which move away in the limit   0. these are not
calculable unless the -functions are known more explicitly. however, we can get
information about the existence or non-existence of such solutions on the basis of

the linear part of the reduction dierential equations (4). we nd that the theorems
of lyapunov [24] , with generalizations by malkin [25], are applicable here [26]. we

refer to [5] for some more discussion, and to [27] for an application. generally, it
turns out that a power series solution (20) is asymptotically stable if there are no
negative eigenvalues of the matrix  1
n m(f 0) in the case of
the solution (23)). a solution is unstable if there is at least one negative eigenvalue.

4. gauge theory

it should be most helpful to discuss briey an example. we use a gauge theory
with one dirac eld, one scalar and one pseudoscalar eld, all in the adjoint rep-

resentation of su(2) [4]. besides the usual gauge couplings, the direct interaction
part of the lagrangian is given by

writing  = g2, where g is the gauge coupling, and k = fk, with k=1,2,3 , the
one-loop -function coecients of this theory are given by

there are no positive integers appearing in the equations (32) or (33). hence the
coecients of the power series solutions are determined and can be removed by
reparametrization, except for the invariant rst term. with  = g2 as the primary
coupling, g being the gauge coupling, these solutions are

(a) 1 = 2 = 3 = g2 ,

which corresponds to an n = 2 extended susy yang-mills theory, and

(b) 1 = g2, 2 =

which is not associated with any known symmetry, at least in four dimensions. both

theories are minimally coupled gauge theories with matter elds. the eigenvalues

11

of the matrix  1
g0 m(f 0), given in eqs.(32),(33), are all negative with the exception
of the third one for the n=2 supersymmetric theory. in this case we have a general
solution corresponding to eq.(26) with  = + 1
2, and with the coecient given by
( 1
2 ) = (0, c, 3c), where c is an arbitrary parameter. the theory with c 6= 0
corresponds to one with hard breaking of susy. it has an asymptotic power series
in g and not in g2, as is the case for the invariant theory.

as we see from eqs.(32) and (33), both power series solutions have some negative
g0 m(f 0), and are therefore unstable. not all nearby

eigenvalues of the matrix  1
solutions approach them asymptotically.

from the present example, and many others, we realize that the special frame,

where the power series solutions of the reduction equations are of the simple form
(20), is a natural frame as far as the reduced one-parameter theories are concerned.

the - functions of the reduced theories are still power series and are not reduced
to polynomials.

5. dual sqcd

as the main application of the reduction method, we consider here the reduction

of multi- parameter theories appearing in connection with duality. as a particular
example, we discuss the dual magnetic theory associated with sqcd [13, 16]. while
sqcd, as the electric theory, has the gauge coupling ge as the only coupling param-
eter, the dual magnetic theory has two parameters: the magnetic gauge coupling
gm and a yukawa coupling 1, which measures the strength of the interaction of
color-singlet superelds with the magnetic quark superelds. it is our aim to dis-
cuss the reduced theories where the yukawa coupling is expressed in terms of the

gauge coupling.

for sqcd the gauge group is su(nc) with n=1 supersymmetry. there are
nf quark superelds qi and their antields qi, i = 1, 2, ..., nf in the fundamental
representation. for completeness and later reference, we give here the -function
coecients for the electric sqcd theory:

e(g2

e) = e0 g4

e + e1 g6

e +    ,

(36)

with

e0 = (162)1(3nc + nf )

e1 = (162)2 2nc(3nc + nf ) + 4nf

n 2
2nc ! .
c  1

(37)

the corresponding dual magnetic theory is constructed mainly on the basis of the
anomaly matching conditions [13, 15, 28]. it involves the gauge group gd = su(n d
c)
with n d
c = nf  nc. here nf is the number of quark superelds qi, qi, i =
1, 2, ..., nf in the fundamental representation of gd. because both theories must
have the same global symmetries, the number of avors nf should be the same
for sqcd and its dual. as we have mentioned, duality requires a non-vanishing

yukawa coupling in the form of a superpotential

w = q1m i

j qi qj.

(38)

f gauge singlet superelds m i

the n 2
j are independent and cannot be constructed
from q and q. the superpotential not only provides for the coupling of the m
supereld, but also removes a global u(1) symmetry acting on m, which would

have no counterpart in the electric theory.

in the following, we will be dealing essentially only with the magnetic theory.
for convenience, we therefore write g in place of gm for the corresponding gauge
coupling. we also omit the subscript m for the -function coecients. then the

-function expansions of the magnetic theory are

already at the one-loop level, we see some important features from eqs.(37),(40).

both theories are asymptotically free at large momenta, in particular the magnetic
theory for nf > 3
2nc. for nf > 3nc, the electric theory is not asymptotically
free in the uv but in the ir, where the magnetic version remains strongly coupled.

hence we expect that the original electric excitations are present in the physical
state space. the situation is reversed for nf < 3
2 nc, where the electric quanta are
conned, and the elementary magnetic excitations describe the system, at least for
nf > nc + 2 where the dual theory exists which is the free magnetic region. this
is the duality picture as proposed by seiberg, with both theories describing the same
physical system.

in the conformal window given in eq.(41), the electric as well as the magnetic

theory are in an interacting non-abelian coulomb phase, and it is indicated that
they both have non-trivial conformal xed points at zeroes of the exact -functions.

at these xed points the theories are actually equivalent. near an endpoint of the
window, in the infrared limit, one theory may be in a weak coupling situation, and

the other, dual theory in a strong coupling regime. since both theories represent
the same system, we can describe the strongly coupled eld theory by the weakly

coupled dual. the free excitations of the latter may be considered as composites of
those of the former theory.

within the framework of this duality picture, the system undergoes an important
phase transition at the point nf = 3
2nc. as has already been mentioned above,
below this point the elementary electric quanta are conned in the sense that they

are not elements of the physical state space.
in the original electric theory, the
transition at nf = 3
2 nc is not apparent from the -function coecients, in contrast
to the phase change at nf = 3nc, where e0 = 0. but in the duality picture, we
have 0 = 0 at nf = 3
2nc for the magnetic theory, and this is the indication for the
phase transition of the system.

many years ago, we have obtained the phase transition of sqcd at nf = 3

2nc
by using a rather dierent method [17]. it involves analyticity and superconvergence

of the gauge eld propagator, as well as the brst-cohomology in order to dene the
physical state space of the theory [18, 21]. the superconvergence relations, where

they exist, are exact. they connect long and short distance information, and are
not valid in perturbation theory [31, 32, 33].

the asymptotic form of the gauge eld propagator is governed by the ratio
00/0, where 00 is the anomalous dimension of the gauge eld (not the supereld)

14

at the xed point  = 0. here   0 is the conventional gauge parameter. because
this parameter is eectively a function of the momentum scale, it tends to a xed
point asymptotically. for example, in general covariant gauges, the discontinuity of

the structure function has the asymptotic form

 k2(k2, 2, g, )  c(g2, ) 0 ln

k2

2!00/0

,

(42)

which is independent of  with the possible exception of the coecient.

for the discussion of connement using the brst cohomology or the quark-
antiquark potential, it is most convenient to work in the landau gauge, where the

superconvergence relation is of the form

dk2(k2, 2, g, 0) = 0,

(43)

z 

0

provided 00/0 > 0. for general gauges   0, the relation is the same except that
the right hand side is given by /0, were 0 =  00
, with 0() = 00 + 01 [33].
in contrast to the duality arguments, the superconvergence method is applicable

01

to non-supersymmetric theories like qcd, where the interval corresponding to the
window (53) for sqcd is given by

13
4

nc < nf <

22
4

nc,

(44)

4 nc for qcd and for nf < 3

for nf < 13
2nc for sqcd, our arguments show that
the transverse gauge eld excitations are not elements of the physical state space
and hence conned. with some further arguments one can extend this result to

quark elds.

for sqcd and similar theories, the connection between duality and supercon-

vergence results is quantitative. for electric and magnetic sqcd, we have the
anomalous dimensions

e00 = (162)1(
m00 = (162)1 1
2

nc + nf )

3
2
(3nc + nf ) ,

(45)

and with the -function coecients from eqs.(37),(40), we obtain the relations

[20, 21]

m0(nf ) = 2e00(nf )

15

e0(nf ) = 2m00(nf ) ,

(46)

where the argument nf on both sides refers to matter elds with dierent quantum
numbers corresponding to electric and magnetic gauge groups. we have restored
the subscript m for these duality relations. we see that e00(nf ) changes sign at
the same point nf = 3
2 nc as m0(nf ), and the ratio e00(nf )/e0(nf ) is positive
below this point, indicating superconvergence and connement as discussed before.

the exact relations (46) are an indication, that the anomalous dimension coef-
cients of the gauge elds at the xed point  = 0 may have a more fundamental

signicance, similar to the one-loop -function coecients.

our discussion about the relation of superconvergence and duality results can be

extended to similar supersymmetric gauge theories with other gauge groups [21, 34,
35]. the results are analogous. however, in the presence of matter superelds in the

adjoint representation [36], the problem is more complicated. there the construction
of dual theories requires a superpotential already for the original electric theory, and
a corresponding reduction of couplings would be called for. also the application of

the superconvergence arguments is not straight forward. these cases deserve further
study.

duality in general superconformal theories has been discussed in [37], and for

softly broken sqcd in [38].

6. reduced dual sqcd

the magnetic theory dual to sqcd contains two parameters, the gauge coupling
g and the yukawa coupling 1. we now want to apply the reduction method de-
scribed in the previous sections and express the coupling parameter 1 as a function
of g2. with eq.(7) we write

1(g2) = g2f1(g2) , with f1(g2) = f 0 +

(l)g2l .



xl=1

the essential one-loop reduction equation is then

0f 0 = (cid:16)c(0)

11 f 0 + c(0)

1 (cid:17) f 0 .

there are two solutions:

f 0 = f01 =

0  c(0)

1

c(0)
11

and f 0 = f00 = 0 ,

16

(47)

(48)

(49)

where f01 is a function of nc and nf , and is given by

f01(nc, nf ) =

nc (nf  nc  2/nc)
(nf  nc)(3nf  nc)

,

(50)

using the explicit expressions (40) for the coecients. here and in the following, we
do not consider possible additional terms which vanish exponentially or faster [5].
the criteria for the unique denition of the coecients (l) in the expansion (47)
are given by

(cid:16)m(f 0)  l0(cid:17) 6= 0 f or l = 1, 2, . . .

with

m(f 0) = c(0)

1 + 2c(0)

11 f 0  0 .

(51)

(52)

upon substitution of the solutions (49) and the explicit form of the coecients from

eqs.(40), wie nd

m(f01)  l0 = 0( + l)
m(f00)  l0 = +0(  l) ,

with 0 from eq.(40) and  as a function of nc and nf given by

(nc, nf ) =

nc (nf  nc  2/nc)
(nf  nc)(2nf  3nc)

.

(53)

(54)

the equations for the coecients (l) are of the general form given in eqs.(15). for
l + 1 loops, they are simply

(cid:16)m(f 0)  l0(cid:17) (l) = (cid:16)l(f 0)f 0  (l)(f 0)(cid:17) + x (l),

(55)

where l = 1, 2, . . . , and where f 0 is to be replaced by the solutions f01 or f00 respec-
tively. the -function coecients are as in eq.(11) with appropriate substitutions.
in the following , we consider characteristic intervals in nf separately, and con-

centrate on the conformal window.

we have already discussed the window 3

2nc < nf < 3nc, where both sqcd
and dual sqcd are asymptotically free at small distances. considering rst the
solution f01(nc, nf ) as given in eq.(50), we see that it is positive in the window,
as is the function (nc, nf ). since also 0 < 0, the coecients in eq.(55) do not

17

vanish. consequently the expansion coecients (l) are uniquely determined and
can be removed by a regular reparametrization transformation. we are left with the
explicit solution

1(g2) = g2 f01(nc, nf ) ,

(56)

with f01 given by eq.(50). the -functions of the reduced theory, as dened by the
solution (56), are now simply given by eqs.(9) and (10)) with the argument f of the
coecient functions replaced by f01(ncnf ) , so that they are constants:

(g2) = (g2, g2f01) =



xl=0

l(f01)(g2)l+2 , 1(g2) = f01(g2) .

(57)

the second relation follows from the reduction equation (4) with eq.(56). the
coecient 0 is as given in eq.(40), and for 1(f01) we obtain explicitly [21, 23]

(162)21(f01) = 2(nf  nc)(3nc  2nf ) + 4nf

(nf  nc)2  1
2(nf  nc)
nc(nf  nc  2/nc)
2(nf  nc)(3nf  nc)

.

4n 2

f

(58)

these relations are used later in connection with the infrared xed point of dual
sqcd in the conformal window near nf = 3
2nc. we must note here, that for the
expansion (57), in addition to 0, the two-loop coecient 1(f01) is reparametrization
invariant. this result follows because f01 satises the reduction equation (48).

it remains to consider the second solution presented in eq.(49), with f 0 = f00 =
0. in this case the second expression in eq.(53) is relevant for the determination of
the higher coecients in the expansion of f1(g2). there could be a zero if (nc, nf )
is a positive integer in the window. generally however, this is not the case (at
least for nc < 16), with the characteristic exception of nc = 3, nf = 5, where
(3, 5) = 2 and the magnetic gauge group is su(2). ignoring this case, we have
again the situation that all coecients (l) are determined and can be removed by
regular reparametrization. then the second power series solution of the reduction
equations is given by

1(g2)  0 ,

(59)

and leads to a theory without superpotential. as we have discussed earlier, this

situation is not acceptable for the dual magnetic theory.

18

returning to the exceptional case with the magnetic gauge group su(2), we nd

that, after reparametrization, it leads to a solution of the form

1(g2) = ag6 + (3)g8 +    ,

(60)

where the coecient a is undetermined, and the higher ones are xed once a is

given. they vanish if a = 0. we do not discuss this case here any further.

finally, we briey consider possible general solutions of the reduction equations.
it turns out that for dual sqcd there are no such solutions which asymptotically
approach the relevant polynomial solution 1(g2) = g2f01 given in eq.(56). the
only general solution we obtain is associated with the excluded polynomial solution
1(g2)  0. it is given by

1(g2) = a(g2)1+ +    ,

(61)

where a is again an undetermined parameter with properties analogous to those
discussed above for eq.(60). as we have pointed out, the exponent , as given in

eq.(54), is positive and generally non-integer in the limit. the only exception is
for nc = 3, nf = 5, in which case we are back to the exceptional solution (60)
discussed above.

we see that, within the set of solutions of the reduction equations for magnetic
sqcd, the power series 1(g2) = g2f01 is the unique choice for duality. ignoring the
isolated su(2) case, the second power series solution 1(g2)  0 is excluded. the
general solution (61), which is associated with it, leads to asymptotic expansions

of greens functions involving non- integer powers. this is not consistent with a
conventional, renormalizable lagrangian formulation. since there are no general
solutions approaching the power solution 1(g2) = g2f01, the latter is isolated or
unstable.

from the one- and two-loop expressions for the -functions of the electric and
the reduced magnetic theories given in eqs.(37) and (40), we can obtain some in-
formation about non-trivial infrared xed points in the conformal window [39, 40].
these expansions are useful as long as the xed points occur for values of nc, nf
near the appropriate endpoint of the window. we nd [23]

m(g 2) = 0

for suciently small and positive values of 3nc  nf and nf  3
2 nc respectively.
larger values of nc may be needed in order to have a useful approximation. higher
order terms have been calculated and may be found in [29].

(63)

with the reduced dual theory depending only upon the magnetic gauge coupling,
it is straightforward to obtain the critical exponent m = m(nc, nf ) near the lower
end of the window at nf = 3
2nc [29]. this exponent is relevant for describing the
rate at which a given charge approaches the infrared xed point. with eqs.(40),

(58) and (62), the lowest order term is given by

m =   dm(g2)

(65)

in both cases we refer to [29] for the next order.

in this report we consider mainly the reduction of dual magnetic sqcd in the
conformal window. a detailed discussion of the situation in the free magnetic phase
nc + 2  nf < 3
2nc may be found in [23]. this interval is non-empty for nf > 4.
the electric theory is uv-free and the magnetic theory ir-free. at low energies, it

is the latter which describes the spectrum. because of the lack of uv-asymptotic
freedom, one may be concerned that the magnetic theory may not exist as a strictly
local eld theory. however, it can be considered as a long distance limit of an

appropriate brane construction in superstring theory, which can also conrm duality
[41]. except for special cases involving again su(2) as the magnetic gauge group,

the unique power series solution (56) remains the appropriate choice also for this
phase. it correspond here to the approach to the trivial infrared xed point. below
nf = nc + 2 there is no dual magnetic gauge theory, and the spectrum should
contain massless baryons and mesons associated with gauge invariant elds.

in the free electric phase for nf > 3nc, the magnetic theory remains uv-free,
and the results of the reduction method are the same as in the conformal window.

20

7. conclusions

in the application to duality, we see that the reduction method is most helpful in
bringing out characteristic features of theories with superpotentials. in the case of

the dual of sqcd, we get an essentially unique solution of the reduction equations,
which corresponds to a renormalizable lagrangian theory with an asymptotic power

series expansion in the remaining gauge coupling. this dual magnetic theory is
asymptotically free. it is uv-free in the conformal window and above, and ir-free

in the free magnetic region below the window. in this latter region, it describes the
low energy excitations. these can be considered as composites of the free quanta of
the electric theory, which is strongly coupled there.

as we have mentioned before, dual theories can be obtained as appropriate limits
of brane systems [41]. in these brane constructions, duality corresponds essentially

to a reparametrization of the quantum moduli space of vacua of a given brane
structure.
it is of interest to nd out how the reduction solutions are related to

special features of these constructions, in particular as far as the unique power
solution (56) is concerned.

besides the use of the reduction method in connection with duality, which we
have described in this article, there are many other theoretical as well as phenomeno-
logical applications. examples of applications in more phenomenological situations

are discussed in this volume by j. kubo [42].

without detailed discussions, we mention here only a few applications:

* construction of gauge theories with minimal coupling of yang-mills and

matter elds [4].

* proof of conformal invariance (niteness) for n = 1 susy gauge theories with

vanishing lowest order -function on the basis of one-loop information [43, 44].

* reduction of the innite number of coupling parameters appearing in the light-

cone quantization method [45].

* reduction in an eective eld theory formulation of quantum gravity and in

eective scalar eld theory [46].
we see that the reduction method can be used also within the framework of non-

renormalizable theories, where the number of couplings is innite a priori.

21

* applications of reduction to the standard model (non-susy) give values for
the top-quark mass which are too small, indicating the need for more matter elds
[47].

* gauge-yukawa unications within the framework of susy guts. successful
calculations of top-quark and bottom-quark masses within the framework of nite

and non-nite theories [9, 48, 42].

* reduction and soft symmetry breaking parameters. in softly broken n = 1

susy theories with gauge-yukawa reduction, one nds all order renormalization
group invariant sum rules for soft scalar masses [49, 50, 42]. there are interesting
agreements with results from superstring based models.

there are other problems where the reduction scheme is a helpful and often an

important tool [51].
