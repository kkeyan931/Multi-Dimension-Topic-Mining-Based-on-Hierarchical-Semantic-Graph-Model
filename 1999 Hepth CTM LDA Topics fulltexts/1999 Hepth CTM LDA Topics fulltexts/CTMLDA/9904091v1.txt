1 introduction

the classical anti-de sitter (ads) space can be dened as the four-dimensional hyper-

boloid

abxaxb = 

1
a2

in r5 with cartesian coordinates xa, where ab = diag(1, 1, 1, 1,  1). in polar
coordinates y = (t, r, , ) the line element may be written

gdydy = (1 + a2r2)dt2 + (1 + a2r2)1dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2) .

the symmetry group (isometry group) of the classical ads space is so(3, 2), which

plays the role of the poincare group on minkowski space. in fact, the poincare group

can be obtained from so(3, 2) by a contraction. the ads space has rather peculiar

features. its time-like geodesics are nite and closed. the time translations are a u(1)

subgroup of so(3, 2). the space-like geodesics are unbounded. furthermore the casual

structure is somewhat complicated.

the ads group, ads space and quantum eld theory based on it has been an

interested topic for a long time[1]. in the early 80s, there was great interest in four-

dimensional n-extended supergravities for which the global so(n) is promoted to

a gauge symmetry[2]. in these theories the underlying supersymmetry algebra is no

longer poincare but rather ads. an important ingredient in these developments was
that the adss7 geometry was not fed in by hand but resulted from a spontaneous
compactication, i.e., the vacuum state was obtained by nding a stable solution of the

higher-dimensional eld equations. there has recently been a revival of interest in ads

space brought about by the conjectured duality between physics in the bulk of ads

and a conformal eld theory on the boundary[3]. this is one of the most important

progresses in the so-called non-perturbative superstring theory. many new results have

been obtained by making use this conjecture[4][5]. here the ads geometry plays a

central role. it might seem very strange that quantum theories in dierent space-time

dimensions could be equivalent. this possibility is related to the fact that the theory

in the large dimension is (among other things) a quantum theory of gravity. for such

2

theories the concept of holography has been introduced as a generic property. the

maldacena conjecture is an example of realization of the holography.

according to general relativity, gravity is nothing but space-time geometry. the

poor understanding of physics at very short distances indicates that the small scale

structure of space-time might not be adequately described by classical continuum ge-

ometry. it is long been suspected that the noncommutivity of space-time might be a

realistic picture of how space-time behaves near the planck scale where strong quantum

uctuations of gravity may make points in space fuzzy. as it is well known, superstring

theory is now the only possible candidate for quantum theory of gravity[6]. the recent

eorts to unify by non-perturbative dualities all the known ve perturbative super-

string theory is referred as m theory[7]. many physicists believe that the m theory is

a fundamental quantum theory in eleven dimensional space-time. the bfss matrix

model[8] is proposed for the microscopic description of m theory in discrete light-cone

quantization. the basic block in the matrix model is a set of n partons, called d0-

branes, on which strings can end. a novel feature of the m(atrix) theory is that the
nine transverse coordinates of the d0-branes are promoted into n  n hermitian ma-
trices. then the noncommutative geometry becomes a natural way to deal with spaces

whose coordinates are noncommutative.

because the noncommutative geometry description is a strong candidate of real-

istic pictures of space-time behaviors at planck scale and the madacena conjecture a

concrete realization of holography the generic feature of quantum theory of gravity,

it is nature to assume that the proper geometry for the madacena conjecture be the

noncommutative ads space.

in this paper, we discuss the quantum ads space and quantum ads group by

investigating real forms of quantum orthogonal group and quantum orthogonal space.

dierential calculus on the quantum ads space are presented. in particular, we set

up relationships between quantum group and quantum algebra, which may be referred

as the quantum counterpart of the classical exponential. it is the relationship which

deduces the quantum ads algebra naturally from the conjugation operation on the

3

quantum ads group. the presentations of the quantum ads algebra are foundations

for constructing quantum eld theory on the quantum ads space.

this paper is organized as follows.

in section 2, we present some preliminary

knowledge about quantum group theory and dierential calculus on quantum orthog-

onal space. a realization of the quantum algebra uq(so(5)) in quantum orthogonal

space is shown in section 3. in section 4, kinds of conjugations on quantum orthogo-

nal group and quantum orthogonal space are constructed to get quantum ads group
and quantum ads space both for |q| = 1 and q being real cases. we state the dier-
ential calculus on quantum ads space in section 5. reality of dierential calculus is

discussed. to deduce quantum ads algebra from conjugation on quantum orthogonal

space and quantum orthogonal group, we set up explicit relationships between quan-

tum group soq(5) and quantum algebra uq(so(5)) in section 6. section 7 is devoted

to study of quantum ads algebra.

can be written into the standard form

where t1  t  1 and t2  1  t .

where ps, pa and p1 are projection operators which act on the tensor product x  x
of the fundamental representation x, and project into the symmetric, antisymmetric

and singlet irreducible representations with dimension 14, 10 and 1, respectively. it is

analogous to the commutative case, we dene the commutation relations of the quan-

tum orthogonal space by requiring the vanishing of their antisymmetric products. here
the quantum antisymmetric products is given by the projector pa,

in components, the commutation relations among coordinates xi is

pa(x  x) = 0 .

here we have used the constraint that the quantum length (l  xtcx = 1/a2) is
invariant under quantum orthogonal group transformations.

the exterior derivative d[10] is an operator which gives the mapping from the

coordinates to the dierentials

d :

xi  dxi .

it satises two properties

d2 = 0 ,

d(f g) = (df )g + (1)f f (dg) .

where f and g are p-forms and (1)f is 1(+1) if f is odd(even) element. the
exterior derivative d is invariant under the quantum group transformation and the

dierential dxi transforms in the same way as the coordinate xi under the quantum

group transformation.

the derivative i can be introduced by

d = dxii = cijdxij .

for the dierential calculus on the quantum orthogonal space[11], the following

relations are satised

3 realization of quantum algebra on quantum space

an action of an algebra a on a space v is a bilinear map,

such that

a : a  v  v ,

p  x  p  x ,

(pq)  x = p  (q  x) ,

1  x = 1 .

we call v an a-module. in the same sense as comultiplication is the dual to multipli-

cation, coactions are dual to actions. the coaction of a coalgebra b on a space v is a

linear map

such that

b :

v  b  v ,

(b  id)b = (id  b)b ,

(id  )b = id .

the coalgebra is referred as a co-module.

we know that the quantum group co-acts on quantum space and is a co-module.

from the above general discussion, we conclude that, as a dual hopf algebra of the

quantum group, the quantum algebra acts on the quantum space. thus, analogue to

the classical case, a realization of quantum algebra on the quantum space should be
exist. and when the deformation parameter q  1, familiar results on lie algebra
should be recovered. following these guidances, we present a realization of quantum

algebra uq(so(5)) on the quantum orthogonal space.

for convenient, we introduce the dilatation operator sm (m  2) as

the dilatation operator satises

smxk = q2xksm ,

smk = q2ksm ,

for |k|  m .

(10)

using the notations

y1 = x1 + q3/2l1+1 ,
1 = 1 + q3/21x+1 ,
y2 = x2 + q5/2l2+2 ,
2 = 2 + q5/22x+2 ,

we can construct a set of independent basis on the quantum orthogonal space

where (i)1 = dix i  x idi and 1/2

for the independent basis of coordinates and derivatives on the quantum space[12][13],

it is not dicult to show that

so that d1 = 1, d2 = 1/2.

the hopf algebra structure of the quantum universal enveloping algebra uq(so(5)) is

of the form

10

(hi) = hi  1 + 1  hi ,
(xi ) = xi  qhi/2 + qhi/2  xi
(hi) = 0 = (xi ) ,
s(xi ) = qdixi
s(hi) = hi ,

(16)

.

in terms of the set of independent basis x i, di on the quantum space, we write down
a realization of the quantum universal enveloping algebra uq(so(5)) in fundamental

representation,

qh2 = (cid:16) 1
x2 = qq1/2(1+1)1/4(cid:16)q3/21/2

therefore, we indeed have a natural action of the quantum algebra uq(so(5)) on the

quantum orthogonal space.

it may be referred as the quantum counterpart of the

lie algebra realized on euclidean space. in fact, at the case of q = 1, this realization

recovered a ordinary realization of lie algebra. this is helpful for clearly understanding

of meanings of quantum group and quantum algebra.

4 quantum ads group and quantum ads space

to study quantum ads group, real forms and -conjugations of quantum orthogonal
group should be introduced. a -structure on a hopf algebra a is an algebra anti-
automorphism (ab) = ba (a, b  a,   c), coalgebra automorphism    =
(  )  ,    =  and involution 2 = 1.

following frt[9], on quantum orthogonal groups conjugations can be dened. the

rst type is trivially as t  = t . compatibility with the yang-baxter equation requires
r = r1 and cc t = 1. this occurs only for |q| = 1. then the ct t relations are
invariant under the -conjugation. as we know the quantum orthogonal group co-
acts on the quantum orthogonal space, and may induce an associated conjugation

11

on the quantum space as well. more precisely a conjugation on the quantum space is

compatible with a conjugation on its quantum symmetry group if the coaction (xa) =
t a
b  xb satises (x) = t   x  (x). the unique associated quantum space
conjugation here is (xa) = xa. clearly, we can not get the desired quantum ads space

by this kind of conjugation on quantum orthogonal space. further structure should

be added to the conjugation to arrive at the quantum ads group and quantum ads

space. for the aim, we introduce another operation on the quantum orthogonal group

as

where the matrix d is of the form

t  = dtd1 ,

(18)

d =

1

1





1

.





it is easy to check that the d matrix is a special element of the quantum orthogonal
group[15], i.e.,

r12d1d2 = d2d1r12 ,
dtcd = c , dcdt = c .

thus the  operation is compatible with the hopf algebra structure of the quantum
orthogonal group,

r12t 1 t 2 = t 2 t 1r12 ,
(t )tct  = c ,
(t ) = d(t )d1 = t   t  ,
(t ) = (t ) ,

s(t ) = [s(t )] .

t c(t )t = c ,

we nally obtain the desired ads quantum group by using the combined operation of
the  and , i.e., the conjugation t   t  = dtd1. the induced conjugation on
the quantum space is x  x = dx. to show that the conjugation really gives the
quantum ads group and quantum ads space, we should nd a linear transformation
x  x = m x, t  t  = mt m1 such that the new coordinates x and t  are
real and the new metric c = (m1)tcm1 diagonal in the q  1 limit, c|q=1 =

12

diag(1,1,1,1, 1). here the m matrix is given by

m =

1

i2

.





the second conjugation of the quantum orthogonal group given by frt[9] is re-
alized via the metric, i.e., t  = c tt c t. the condition on the quantum r matrix
is r = r, which happens for q  r. again the ct t relations are invariant under
such a conjugation operation. the corresponding real form is soq(5; r). the induced

conjugation on the quantum space is x = c tx. again, we can not get the desired

quantum ads group and quantum ads space by this kind of conjugation along. to
obtain quantum ads group, we introduce the operation  on the quantum orthogonal
group soq(5) as

where n matrix is of the form

t  = n tn 1 ,

1

1

n =





1

1

1

.





the n matrix is also a special element of the quantum orthogonal group, i.e.,

r12n1n2 = n2n1r12 ,
n tcn = c , n cn t = c .

(19)

(20)

thus the  operation is also compatible with the hopf algebra structure of quantum
group. we obtain the desired ads quantum group by using the combined operation of
the  and , i.e., the conjugation t   t  = n c tt c tn 1. the induced conjugation
on the quantum space is x  x = c tn x.

parallel to the case of |q| = 1, we prove the combined conjugation really gives the
quantum ads group and quantum ads space by trying to nd a linear transformation

13

x  x = n x, t  t  = nt n1 such that the new coordinates x and t  are
real and the new metric c = (n1)tcn1 diagonal in the q  1 limit, c|q=1 =
diag(1,1,1,1, 1). we nd a n matrix which satises all these requirements of the
form

5 dierential calculus on the quantum ads space

to study dierential calculus on the quantum ads space, we should introduce conjugate

derivatives. because there are two dierent conjugations on the quantum ads space

corresponds to the deformation parameter q being root of unit or real, respectively. we

present dierential calculus on the quantum ads space for the two cases separately.
in the case of q being root of unit, we note the conjugation on xi, r and c is given

by

xi  = dijxj ,

ij = r1 vu
ruv

ji

,

c ij = c ji .

(21)

because the matrix d is a special element of the quantum orthogonal group, we can
prove that

r1 ik

ld dkndsldipdtd = r1 st
pn .

the r-matrix has the following symmetry properties

c im rjn

mkcnl = r1 ij

kl = ckm rmi

ln c nj ,

and

rij
kl = rkl
ij .

14

(22)

(23)

using the above relations as well as the conjugation of the denition of derivatives,
ixj = j

il xlk, we obtain the action of the conjugate derivatives on the quantum

i + q rjk

ads space,

mxs = s

m + q rsl

mkxk l ,

(24)

where m  q1dmkckv v .

this show that the action of the conjugate derivatives on the quantum ads space
is almost the same with that of the derivatives at the case of |q| = 1. in fact, we can
represent the conjugate derivatives  linearly in terms of the derivatives ,

v  = qcvkdkmm .

(25)

from a very general consideration[10], we know that there are two types of consis-

tent derivatives i and i satisfy the following relations, respectively,

ixj = j
kxv = v

i + q rjk
il xlk ,
k + q1 r1 vi

kj xj i .

(26)

the rst one is just what given in eq.(9). we show that the second one is related with
the conjugate derivatives in the case of q  r.

in the following, we present actions of the conjugate derivatives on the quantum
ads space at the case of q  r. to proceed, we rst conjugate the rst relation in
eq.(26) and invert it to nd an expression for i xj in terms of xji by using

xi  = cjinjkxk

and the symmetry properties of the r-matrix eq.(22) and (23). the result is:

q5nipciac va v  xs = q4ciacp rp

alnslnipq4 r1 ik

ld nknnslnipntdxncdbc mbndt m  .
(27)

making use of eq.(20), we know that

15

r1 ik

ld nknnslnipntd = r1 st
pn .

pxs = s

p + q1 r1 st

pn xn t ,

then, we get

where

p = q5nipciac va v  .

i (or equivalient i ) can be expressed algebraically in terms of xk and l[16],

k = q3s1

2 [2, xk] .

(28)

(29)

to complete the dierential calculus on the quantum ads space, we give the consistent
relations satised by  and

j = q1 rlk

ij = q rlk

6 quantum group via quantum algebra

it is well known that, in lie group theory, there is an exponential corresponding between

group and algebra. representations of lie group are easily deduced from that of

lie algebra. and then quantum eld theory is constructed based on representations

of lie algebra. however, in general, there is no such a direct transformation from

quantum algebra to quantum group, besides duality between them. bearing the goal

of constructing quantum eld theory on noncommutative geometry, we try to set up an

explicit relationship[17] between quantum orthogonal group and quantum orthogonal

algebra.

it is convenient to introduce the operator l+ as

as well known, in the classical case, many important properties of lie group are

conveniently studied using corresponding lie algebra and vise verse. this is based on

the exponential relation of lie group and lie algebra. however, in the quantum group

theory, there is no such a counterpart of exponential has been found. all we know is

18

the duality between quantum group and quantum algebra. we give here an explicit

relation between elements of quantum group and generators of the quantum universal

enveloping algebra,

it is straightforward to verify that the matrix t dened above really satises all rela-

tions which a quantum group should be satised. let p  be the transposition operator,

for arbitrary matrices a and b, which satises

then the comultiplication  for these tensor operator t can be introduced as

p  : a b = b a .

it is easy to check that

 = (id  p   id)l l .

(39)

(t ) = (id  p   id)l l(l l)
= (id  p   id)(l l l l)
= (l l) (l l)
= t t .

20

dene counit operator  as

then we have (t ) = 1. finally, the antipode operator s is of the form,

 = l  l .

by making use of the relations (35), it is a straightforward calculation to check that

s = p (sl  sl)p  .

s(t ) = s(l l)

= p (sl  sl)p (l l)
= p (sl(l)  sl(l))
= ct tc1 .

at the stage, we can say that a realization of quantum group soq(5) is given in terms

of quantum algebra uq(so(5)).

7 quantum ads algebra

quantum eld theory is usually constructed based on representations of an algebra.

to get a quantum eld theory on noncommutative geometry, we should investigate

properties of the quantum ads algebra. of course, rst of all, we should give conju-

gations on quantum ads algebra, which is consistent with conjugations on quantum

ads group and quantum ads space.

at the case of |q| = 1, conjugation on quantum ads group is given by



t  = dtd1
t11
t21
t31 t32
t41
t51

=



t14
t24

t12 t13
t22 t23
t42 t43
t52 t53

t15
t25
t33 t34 t35
t45
t55

t44
t54





.

(40)

from the relationship between quantum group and quantum algebra, i.e., t = l l,
we deduce directly the corresponding quantum ads algebra as

1  = x +
x +
1 ,
2  = x +
x +
2 ,

x1  = x1 ,
x2  = x2 ,

h1 = h1 ,

h2 = h2 .

(41)

21

it is easy to show that this type of conjugation on quantum algebra satises all re-

quirements for a conjugation.

for the case of q being real, we know from the previous section that the conjugation

structure of the quantum ads group is given by

t55

=

t  = n c tt (c1)tn 1
qt54
t44
q1/2t34
q1t24
q2t14 q3/2t13 q1t12
for t = l l, the proper conjugation operation is given by

q3t51
q3/2t53 q2t52
q2t41
q1/2t43
qt42
q1/2t32 q3/2t31
qt21
t22
t11

q1t45
q3/2t35
q2t25
q3t15





t33

q1/2t23

t  = l   l  ,

(cid:16) l (cid:17)ij  (cid:16)lij(cid:17) .

.





(42)

(43)

comparing of eq.(42) and (43) gives the corresponding quantum ads algebra to quan-

tum ads group and quantum ads space,

1  = q2x1 ,
x +
2  = q3/2x2 ,
x +

x1  = q2x +
1 ,
x2  = q3/2x +
2 ,

h1 = h1 ,
h2 = h2 .

(44)

therefore, nally, we obtain the quantum ads algebra for both the case of |q| = 1 and
q  r. the representations of the quantum ads algebra[18] should be foundations of
constructing quantum eld theory on the quantum ads space. further investigating

on this direction is still on progressing.
