it is well known that any three-manifold can be obtained by surgery on a framed link in
s3. lickorish gave an elementary proof for the existence of the three-manifold invariants of

witten using a framed link description of the manifold and the formalisation of the bracket

polynomial as the temperley-lieb algebra. kaul determined three-manifold invariants

from link polynomials in su (2) chern-simons theory. lickorishs formula for the invariant

involves computation of bracket polynomials of several cables of the link. we describe an

easier way of obtaining the bracket polynomial of a cable using representation theory of

composite braiding in su (2) chern-simons theory. we prove that the cabling corresponds

to taking tensor products of fundamental representations of su (2). this enables us to

verify that the two apparently distinct three-manifold invariants are equivalent for a specic

relation of the polynomial variables.

1. introduction

classication of three dimensional manifolds has been a long standing problem. wit-

ten [1] succeeded in giving an intrinsically three-dimensional denition for jones type

polynomial invariants [2,3] of links using a topological quantum eld theory known as

chern-simons theory. wittens approach gives rise to three-manifold invariants z(m )

(also called the partition function for the manifold m ) via surgery on framed links.

the existing denitions of three-manifold invariants rely on two results:

i: the fundamental theorem of lickorish [4] and wallace [5] that any connected, closed,
orientable three-manifold can be obtained by surgery on a framed link in s3.

ii: the theorem due to kirby [6] that two framed links determine the same three-manifold

if and only if they are related by a sequence of diagram moves which are referred to as

kirby moves.

it follows from kirbys theorem that invariants of framed links which are unchanged under

kirby moves give an invariant of three-manifolds.

computations of the witten invariant are achieved by exploiting the connection be-

tween chern-simons eld theory and a two dimensional conformal eld theory known as

wess-zumino conformal eld theory. though there are questions about measure in the

functional integral formulation of chern-simons theory, the computed values of these in-

variants agree with the ones obtained from other mathematically rigorous approaches-

viz., exactly solvable two dimensional statistical mechanical models [7], quantum groups

[8-10], temperley-lieb algebra [14,12]. the interconnections between chern-simons the-

ory, wess-zumino conformal eld theory, solvable models and quantum groups have been

summarised in refs.[15,16].

given a primitive 4rth root of unity, lickorish [12,13] denes an invariant fl(m ) as
a linear combination of bracket polynomials of cables of a framed link on s3 which under

surgery gives the three-manifold m . the cabling is necessary for the preservation of the

invariant under kirby moves. however, it introduces a large number of crossings in the

diagram, and determining the bracket polynomials of link diagrams with several crossings

is extremely cumbersome by the recursive method. hence, the computation of lickorishs

invariant is not easy.

witten showed that the jones and homfly polynomials of links in s3 correspond

to expectation values of wilson loops carrying dening representation of the su (2) and

su (n ) gauge groups respectively [1]. this method has been generalised to arbitrary higher

1

dimensional representations of any compact semi-simple group resulting in a whole lot of
new invariants of (framed) links in s3 [15-19]. we refer to these eld theoretic invariants as

generalised invariants. unlike jones, homfly and bracket polynomials, the generalised

invariants cannot be solved completely by the recursive method. hence, a direct method

of evaluating these was developed in refs. [15-19].

by construction these generalised invariants depend on the framing chosen for the

link. however, by xing the framing to be standard, i.e., one in which the linking number

of the link with its frame is zero, ambient isotopy invariants of links are obtained.

in

refs. [15-19], the emphasis was on obtaining ambient isotopy invariants of links and hence

computations were done in standard framing. in the present problem, we require a eld

theoretic presentation for the bracket polynomial of a link diagram. bracket polynomials

are regular isotopy invariants. so we choose the vertical or the black-board framing.

we show how the chern-simons invariant p1,1,...,1[dl](q) in vertical framing for dening
representation placed on any n-component link l is related to the bracket polynomial
hdli(a) provided the polynomial variables satisfy
q1/4 = a.

(1.1)

the relation is proved by rst establishing a connection between the eld theoretic invariant

p1,1,...,1[dl](q) and the jones polynomial, and then using the well-known relationship
between the jones polynomial and the bracket polynomial (see section 3 and theorem

1).

using the generalised regular isotopy invariants in su (2) chern-simons theory, kaul

[16] has derived a three-manifold invariant fk[m ]. it is mentioned in [16] that wherever
computed, the chern-simons partition function z[m] turns out to be the same as his
three-manifold invariant except for the normalisation. that is, fk(m ) = z[m ]/z[s3]. we
expect kauls invariant to be equivalent to wittens invariant for an arbitrary m . we

show the equivalence by the following sequence of steps:

(i) we prove that the lickorishs and kauls invariants are equivalent with the polynomial

variables obeying (1.1) by nding an elegant and easier method of determining bracket

polynomials of cables of link diagrams. (see theorem 2.) this is achieved by using the

techniques developed in ref.[20] -viz., representation theory of composite braids.

(ii) in [13] the equivalence between lickorishs invariant and the reshetikin-turaev invari-

ant was established. the reshetikin-turaev invariant is considered as a reformulation of

wittens invariant using quantum groups (see [9], [10]).

2

it follows that kauls invariant is a reformulation of the reshetikin-turaev invariant in

terms of the chern-simons generalised framed link invariants.

the plan of the paper is as follows. in section 2, we describe lickorishs three-manifold

invariant obtained using bracket polynomials. we present in section 3, the techniques used

in evaluating chern-simons regular isotopy invariants. we show detailed computations for

the hopf link and then generalise the method to prove theorem 1. then, we dene

the three-manifold invariant derived by kaul from these generalised link invariants.

in

section 4, we study the representation theory of parallel copies of braids. this is essential

to compute directly the bracket polynomial for cables of link diagrams without going

through the extremely tedious process of recursive evaluation. we show the details of our

computation for the (2, 3)-cable of the hopf link and generalise the techniques to arbitrary

links. in the concluding section, we show that the three-manifold invariants obtained by

lickorishs approach and the eld theory approach are equivalent and thereby provide an

easier method for computing lickorishs invariant.

2. lickorishs three manifold invariant

we briey present the salient features of lickorishs three-manifold invariant obtained

from bracket polynomials.

an n-component link l in s3 is a subset of s3 homeomorphic to the union of n dis-

joint circles. a framing f = (f1, f2, . . . , fn) on l is an assignment of an integer to each
component of l. a regular projection of a link in the plane is one with transverse double

points as the only self-intersections. these double points are referred to as crossings. a

link diagram is obtained from a regular projection by marking the under crossing arc at

a crossing with a break to indicate that part of the curve dips below the plane. regular

isotopy is an equivalence relation on the set of link diagrams. it is generated by reide-

meister moves ii and iii [21]. a framed link [l, f ] can be represented by a diagram dl
in the plane such that the framing on each component of l equals the sum of crossing

signs in the part of the diagram that represents that component. given a link diagram,

the framing it represents will be called the blackboard framing or the vertical framing.

the bracket polynomial as normalised in [12] is a function

h i: {link diagrams in (r2  ) of unoriented links }  z[a1]

(2.1)

dened by the following three properties.

3

(i) hi = 1;
(ii) hdl  ui = (a2  a2) < dl >, where u is a component with no crossings;
(iii) h i = ah i + a1h i where this refers to three diagrams identical except at one

crossing where they look as shown.

this is a regular isotopy invariant of link diagrams.

in order to dene a three-manifold invariant using the bracket, lickorish obtains an

expression which is invariant under kirby moves on link diagrams. before we can state

lickorishs result we need the following denition.

denition: for a diagram dl representing an n component framed link [l, f ], and a given
n-tuple of nonnegative integers c = [c(1), c(2), . . . , c(n)], a c-cable c  dl is dened as the
diagram obtained by replacing the ith component of l in dl by c(i) copies all parallel in
the plane.

as in [13], let r be a xed integer, r  3, and let c(n, r) denote the set of all functions
c: {1, 2, . . . , n}  {0, 1, . . . , r 2}. let a be a primitive 4r-th root of unity. let g = g(a)
be the gauss sum p4r

and let g denote the complex conjugate of g.

l=1 al2

proposition [12] [13] : let m be a three-manifold obtained from s3 by surgery on an

n-component framed link represented by a diagram dl, and let  and  be the signature
and the nullity of the linking matrix, respectively. then

fl(m ) = 

+n

2 xcc(n,r)

c(1)c(2) . . . , c(n)hc  dli

is an invariant of the three-manifold with  and c given by

c = 2g1ar2+3xj 02jr2c

 = (1)r+1a6( g/g),
(1)c+j(cid:18) c + j

j (cid:19)(cid:16)a2(c+2j+1)  a2(c+2j+1)(cid:17) .

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

in [12] only the existence and uniqueness of the c was shown without giving any
method of computation. the formulas (2.3) and (2.4) for  and c, 0  c  n, were
obtained in [13]. the equivalence of lickorish invariant to reshetikin-turaev invariant as
in the kirby-melvin [10] formulation is established in [13] for a = e

2r .

i

4

in spite of having these formulas the computation of the invariant fl is quite dicult
as one has to compute bracket polynomials of the c-cables which is very cumbersome.

as mentioned in [12] if r = 6, and dl is a standard diagram of the trefoil with only 3
crossings, the computation of < 4 dl > using the denition of the bracket as given above
would involve 248 operations. in the next two sections, we will concentrate on the link

invariants from chern-simons eld theory with the motivation of nding an easier method

of computing the bracket polynomials of cables.

3. su (2) chern-simons theory and link invariants

now, we briey present the methods employed in the direct evaluation of chern-

simons link invariants [1,15-19].

the metric independent action s of the su (2) chern-simons theory on any three-

manifold m 3 is given by

s =

k

4 zm 3

a  da +

3

a  a  a

(3.1)

where a is a one-form (matrix-valued in the lie algebra of a compact semi-simple lie
t adx where t a are the su (2) generators and k is the
group su (2)). explicitly, a = aa

coupling constant.

the wilson loop operators of any link l embedded in m 3 is given by

wr1r2...rn (l) = yi

wri (ci) = yi

{t rri p expici

adx}

(3.2)

where cis are the component knots of the link l and t rri refers to the trace over the
su (2) representation ri placed on the component ci.

the link invariants are given by the expectation value of the wilson loop operator:

p2r1,2r2,...,2rn [dl] = hwr1,r2,...,rn(l)i = r [da] qi wri (ci) eis

,

(3.3)

r [da] eis

where dl denotes a diagram representing the framed link l in vertical or black-board
frame. this functional integral over the space of matrix valued one forms a is evaluated

by exploiting the connection between the chern-simons theory in three dimensional space

with boundary and the su (2)k wess-zumino conformal eld theory on the two dimensional
boundary [1]. the computation of these invariants has been considered in detail in refs.

[15-19]. we summarize this below.

5

we represent a link as the closure of a braid. the braid group bm consisting of
m-strand braids is generated by bi, 1  i  m  1, where bi represents a right-handed
half-twist between the i-th strand and the i + 1-st strand. the inverse b1
corresponds

i

to a left-handed half-twist. for a standard reference on braid groups see [22]. in order to

illustrate the technique of direct evaluation of link invariant (3.3), we will take the example

of the hopf link. the details we present in this example are general enough for deriving

invariants of links obtained from a four-strand braid either by platting or capping.

in

theorem 1 we generalise the technique to arbitrary links.

consider the hopf link h, obtained from a four-strand braid (drawn as a closure

of a two-strand braid), embedded in s3 as shown in fig.1. let j1 and j2 denote the

representations placed on the two component knots of h.

let us slice the three-manifold s3 into two three dimensional balls as shown in fig.2(a)

and (b). the two dimensional s2 boundaries of the three-balls are oppositely oriented and

have four points of intersections with the braid, which we refer to as four punctures.

now, exploiting the connection between chern-simons theory and wess-zumino con-

formal eld theory, the functional integrals of these three-balls correspond to states in the

space of four point correlator conformal blocks of the wess-zumino conformal eld theory

[1]. the dimensionality of this space is dependent on the representation of su (2) placed

on the strands and the number of punctures on the boundary. in the present example, the

dimension of the space is

= (1)j1+j2lq[j1(j1+1)+j2(j2+1)s(s+1)]/2.

(3.7)

(3.9)

j1(cid:19)(cid:19) , s  j1  j2, t  min(j1  j1, j2  j2),

(3.10)

the matrix elements of the duality matrix are the su (2) quantum racah coecients which

are known [18,8].

8

for example, the duality matrix for j1 = j2 = 1

2 (dening/ fundamental representation

of su (2)) is a 2  2 matrix:

where the number in square bracket refers to the quantum number dened as

(3.11)

(3.12)

with q (also called deformation parameter in quantum algebra su (2)q) related to the
coupling constant k as q = exp( 2i
k+2 ). we will see that the invariants are polynomials in q.
now, let us determine the states corresponding to figs.2(a) and (b). since the braiding
i as basis states. let |1i

is in the side two parallel strands, it is preferable to use |(side)
be the state corresponding to fig. 2(a). clearly, we can write the state for fig. 2(b) as

s

|2i = b2

1|1i

(3.13)

this state should be in the dual space as its s2 boundary is oppositely oriented compared
to the boundary in fig. 2(a). then the link invariant is given by

p2j1,2j2[dh ] = h1|b2

1|1i

(3.14)

for determining the polynomial, we will have to express the states as linear combination
of the basis states |side
i. the coecients in the linear combination are chosen such that
h1|1i = p2j1,2j2[du 2 ] = [2j1 + 1][2j2 + 1] ,

s

where p2j1,2j2[du 2 ] gives the polynomial of the unlink with 2 components. 3
the above mentioned restrictions determine the state |1i (see [17]) as:

|1i =

min(j1+j2,kj1j2)

xs=|j1j2|

p[2s + 1]|side

s

i

(3.15)

substituting it in eqn. (3.14) and using the braiding eigenvalue (3.7), we obtain

p2j1,2j2[dh ] =

min(j1+j2,kj1j2)

xs=|j1j2|

[2s + 1]((+)

s,r(j1, j2))2 .

(3.16)

3 we work in the unknot polynomial normalisation p2j[du ] = [2j + 1] with the representation

j placed on unknot. the square bracket denotes the quantum number (3.12).

9

for j1 = j2 = 1/2, we get the following polynomial.

p1,1[dh ] = q

(3.17)

the bracket polynomial for hopf link, represented by diagram dh , obtained by the recur-
sive method is

hdhi = a6 + a2 + a2 + a6 = p1,1[dh ] |q1/4=a.

(3.18)

the bracket polynomial hdli(a) and jones polynomial v [l](q) for any n-component
link are related as given below (see, for instance, [13] which uses a dierent normalisation4)

(1)nv [l](q) |q1/4=a = (a)3hdli(a) ,

(3.19)

where  is the writhe or the sum of crossing signs5 in the diagram dl.

the jones polynomial is obtained by placing the dening representation j1 = j2 = 1
2
on the component knots in standard framing. the standard framing braiding eigenvalue
for a right-handed half-twist in parallel strands (+)
r,r(j1, j2) is related to the corresponding
vertical framing eigenvalue as

(3.20)

this equation determines the frame correction factor between the ambient isotopy invariant

and the regular isotopy invariant. using (3.16), it is clear that for the hopf link the jones

polynomial v [h] is related to the invariant in vertical framing as

v [h] =

s,r(j1, j2))2 = q3/2p1,1[dh ].

(3.21)

for the diagram in figure 1,  = 2, and the number of components n = 2. combining
(3.19) and (3.21) we get p1,1[dh ] |q

= hdhi which conrms eqn. (3.18).

the method elaborated above for a specic example can be generalised for any n-

i=1[2ji + 1].

discussed in [18]. the closure as shown in fig.4 will demand that

(jm+1, jm+2 . . . , j2m) = (jm, jm1 . . . , j1) .

additional restrictions on ji are dictated by the braid word p and the n-component
link. the link invariant is well-dened only if all strands which correspond to the same

component of the link are marked with the same ji. (i.e.), at most n of the jis can be
dierent.

with these inputs, any n-component link invariant will be

p2j1,2j2,...,2jn = h2|1i

(3.24)

in order to compare this invariant with the jones polynomial, we choose j1 = j2 =
. . . = jn = 1/2 and as a consequence of the frame correction factor (3.20) between ambient
isotopy (standard framing) and regular isotopy (vertical framing) we have

v [l] = (q

3

4 )p1,1,...,1[dl].

(3.25)

hence from eqn.(3.19) we have the result (3.22) (proved).

the generalised link polynomials (3.24) of some of the knots up to eight crossings and

two component links have been tabulated in appendix ii of [18]. we have to use vertical

framing braiding eigenvalues (3.7), (3.9) instead of the standard framing eigenvalues.

with these regular isotopy polynomial invariants, a three-manifold invariant which

respects kirbys theorem has been constructed in [16]; the formula being

fk(m ) = [l] xcc(n,k+2)

and  denotes the signature of the linking matrix in a framed link representation of the

manifold m .

it is not a priori clear whether this formula gives the same invariant as the lickorish
invariant (2.2) 6 with the polynomial variables related as in eqn. (1.1). in order to verify

the equality, we need to nd a method of determining brackets of cables in terms of the

invariant pc(1),c(2),...,c(n) (3.24).

in the next section, we will present the representation theory of composite braiding

which will prove useful to directly compute the invariants of cables of link diagrams.

4. composite braiding and c-cable link invariants

the representation theory of composite braiding involves determination of braiding

eigenvalues, eigen basis and the duality matrix. one such representation in standard

framing was presented in [19] in an attempt to distinguish a class of knots called mutants.

in this paper, we have a slightly dierent composite braiding. the braiding eigenvalues

and eigen basis are derived in a similar fashion as in ref. [19].

denition: a c-composite of a given braid is obtained by replacing every strand by

c-strands and the generator bi by a composite braiding b(r)

i

b(c)
i = b(ci, ci + c  1)b(ci  1, ci + r  2) . . . b(ci  c + 1, ci)

(4.1)

where b(i, j) = bibi+1 . . . , bj.

for convenience we will call the original braid an elementary braid and the new one

the composite braid. when we are dealing with a link it is possible to replace dierent

components by a dierent number of parallel copies. in order to handle that case we have

to consider mixed composite braids which we describe below.

denition: let c = (c1, c2, . . . , cn). an c-composite braid of an elementary braid is

obtained by replacing the i-th strand by ci-strands and the generator bi by b(c)

we shall again take the hopf link from fig.1 as an example and work out the details for
the (2, 3)-cable. let us denote the resulting diagram as (2, 3)  dh and the corresponding
eld theory invariant in vertical framing as p{2j1},{2j2}[(2, 3)  dh ]. this notation implies
that j1 is the representation of su (2) placed on all the elementary strands constituting the

r1 = 2 bunch of strands and j2 on all the elementary strands in the r2 = 3 bunch.

we are interested in determining the invariant p{1},{1}[(2, 3)dh] so that using (3.22),

we get the bracket polynomial h(2, 3)  dhi.

we present the steps, analogous to the ones in section 3, to evaluate p{1},{1}[(2, 3) 
dh ] which is obtained by gluing the two three-balls as shown in fig. 6(a) and (b). clearly,

the boundary is a ten-punctured surface as against the earlier elementary case considered

in section 3. so, the functional integrals on these three-balls corresponds to states in the

space of ten-point correlator conformal blocks in the wess-zumino conformal eld theory.
the basis is so chosen that it is the eigen basis of the composite braiding operator b(2,3)

.

using the elementary braiding eigenvalues (3.7), duality matrix (3.11), and some of the

properties of the duality matrix which are given in appendix i of [18], it can be shown that
the eigen basis for (2, 3)-mixed braiding in the side strands is |side

4 =a(cid:17) = h(2, 3)  dhi .

(4.9)

this is expected from theorem 1 for the ve component link.

now we generalise the technique used here for cables of arbitrary link diagrams. a

bold face lower case letter will indicate an n-tuple of numbers, for ex., c = (c1, c2, . . . , cn).
using theorem 1 we obtain:

theorem 2: the bracket polynomial of a c-cable of the diagram of an n-component

link can be expressed in terms of elementary link invariants in vertical framing (3.24); the

proof: consider an c-cable of an n-component link l. suppose that l is obtained

from closure of an elementary m-braid. let us replace each strand corresponding to the
i-th component of the link by ci parallel strands, 1  i  n. this gives a mixed composite
braid say (c

(4.12)
where ti  (ti1  li2) with t1 = l2, t2m3 = l2m and lis as in (4.11). the closure of
the braid demands:

(lm+1, . . . , l2m) = p (l1, l2, . . . , lm) .

the constraint of closing the braid to give an n-component link, n  m requires that at
most n of the lis are distinct, and the rest are determined by the link under consideration.

incorporating the above mentioned conditions and also using (3.24), we get the com-

posite invariant to be:

p{1},{1},...,{1}[c  dln ] = h(c1,c2,...,cn)

|(c1,c2,...,cn)

i = xl1,l2,...,ln

p2l1,2l2,...,2ln[dln ]. (4.13)

it is evident that the number of components in the c-cable of the n-component link is
c1 + c2 + . . . cn. hence theorem 1 gives the result (4.10) (proved).

we expand all the tensor products in (4.11) using (3.5) to get some useful relations

for proving the equality of the two apparently distinct three-manifold invariants dened
by lickorish and kaul. the closed form expression for the tensor product for ci  k turns
out to be

li  ms 02sci

asjs mt ci+22t2(ci1)

(4.14)

where representations js and jt are given by 2js = ci  2s and 2jt = 2t  ci  2 and
as = (cid:18) ci  1

s (cid:19) are the constants.

we use this tensor product expansion to rewrite the bracket of an c-cable in the

following corollary.

corollary 1: with q

1

4 = a, the bracket polynomial of the c-cable of an n-component

link diagram d, where c = (c1, c2, . . . , cn), is given by

(4.16)

the inverse of corollary 1 expressing elementary invariants pl1,l2,...,ln[d] in terms of
the composite invariants hc di will be useful in proving the equivalence between lickorish
and kauls three-manifold invariants. hence inverting (4.15) we obtain the following:

theorem 3: for a diagram d of an n-component link, the invariant pl1,l2,...,ln[d]

can be expressed in terms of bracket polynomials as follows.

pl1,l2,...,ln[d] = xj 02jili

ji (cid:19)(cid:27)h(l  2j)  di.

(4.17) to:

ji (cid:19) ali2ji,si(cid:27) ps1,s2,...,sn[d], (4.18)
pl1,l2,...,ln [d] = xj 02jili
where s = (s1, s2, . . . , sn) is such that li  si is even and 0  si  li  2ji. let us make
a change of variable li  si = 2s
i, write each sum as a multiple sum, and interchange the

(cid:27)

a simple arithmetic shows that the expression in the rhs of (4.23) is 0. (proved).

now that we have given a direct method of determining the bracket polynomials of

cables of link diagrams, we will show, in the next section, that the three-manifold invariants

obtained from regular isotopy eld theoretic invariants (3.26) are the same as (2.2) for the

polynomial variables satisfying eqn. (1.1).

5. conclusions

we have given a eld theoretic presentation for bracket polynomials in terms of framed

link invariants in su (2) chern-simons theory with the polynomial variable obeying (1.1).

then, using representation theory of composite braids, we obtained a direct method of

20

evaluating bracket polynomials of cables of link diagrams. this enables us to show that

the three-manifold invariant obtained by lickorish using the formalisation of the bracket

polynomial as temperley-lieb algebra and the invariant obtained by kaul using generalised

link invariants from chern-simons theory are equal upto normalisation. however the

normalising factor depends on the choice of a, the 4r-th root of unity.

gers a and b, dened as [23] :

r related to the coupling constant in eld theory as k = r  2. lickorishs invariant fl
obtained from the formalisation of the bracket polynomial as temperley-lieb algebra and

kauls invariant fk obtained using generalised link invariants from chern-simons theory,
for the polynomial variables obeying (1.1), are related as:

(5.5)

(5.6)

we use theorem 3 to write fk in terms of brackets of cables of the diagram d which
represents the framed link associated with the manifold and compare the coecients of
hc  di. we see that



fk(m ) = n

2 fl(m ).

note that  = 1, and n is odd. the result follows. (proved.)

it was shown [13] that with a = e

i

2r lickorishs invariant equals the reshitikin

tureav invariant upto normalisation and a change of variable. so from theorem 4, it follows

that kauls invariant dened using the generalised link invariants in vertical framing is a

reformulation of the reshetikin-turaev invariant. the kauman-lins invariant dened in

chapter 12 of [14] gives another normalization of the witten-reshetikin-turaev invariant

following lickorishs temperley-lieb algebra approach.

we shall rewrite the inferred result in the following corollary.

corollary 2: the relationship between the kauman-lins invariant z(m ), which is

witten-reshetikin-turaev invariant upto a normalisation, and kauls invariant fk is

fk(m ) = z(m )/z(s3), where z(s3) = 0 = r 2

r

r(cid:17) .
sin(cid:16) 

(5.7)

we have shown by an indirect procedure that kauls three-manifold invariant equals

wittens partition function. it would be very interesting to see whether there is a direct

method of deducing the above result.
