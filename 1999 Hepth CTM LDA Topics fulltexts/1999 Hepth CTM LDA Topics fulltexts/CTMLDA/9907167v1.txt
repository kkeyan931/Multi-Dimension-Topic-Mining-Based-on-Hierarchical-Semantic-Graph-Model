abstract

recently d. buchholz and r. verch have proposed a method for im-
plementing in algebraic quantum eld theory ideas from renormaliza-
tion group analysis of short-distance (high energy) behavior by passing
to certain scaling limit theories. buchholz and verch distinguish be-
tween dierent types of theories where the limit is unique, degenerate,
or classical, and the method allows in principle to extract the ultra-
particle content of a given model, i.e. to identify particles (like quarks
and gluons) that are not visible at nite distances due to connement.
it is therefore of great importance for the physical interpretation of
the theory. the method has been illustrated in a simple model in with
some rather surprising results.

this paper will focus on the question how the short distance be-
havior of models dened by euclidean means is reected in the cor-
responding behavior of their minkowski counterparts. more speci-
cally, we shall prove that if a euclidean theory has some short distance
limit, then it is possible to pass from this limit theory to a theory
on minkowski space, which is a short distance limit of the minkowski
space theory corresponding to the original euclidean theory.

1 introduction

in the past three decades several approaches have been developed
that incorporate the physical principles of quantum eld theory in
a mathematically rigorous fashion. among these rigorous approaches
the framework of algebraic quantum eld theory is probably the most
highly developed.
its basic objects are algebras of observables, in-
dexed by domains of space-time where the observables can be mea-
sured. hence the interpretation of the basic structure is rather clear-
cut. many deep, model independent results have been obtained within
this framework, which has also proved well adapted to the construction
and analysis of models in two dimensional conformal eld theory.

on the other hand, models of quantum elds based on concrete
lagrangians are usually constructed by means of euclidean functional
integrals [16]. from the constructive point of view these methods have
many advantages, for the basic algebraic structure is commutative and
powerful tools from classical statistical mechanics can be applied. the
passage from such objects in euclidean space to algebraic quantum
eld theory on minkowski space time is mathematically a highly non-
trivial operation, however, and it is by no means clear in general how
properties of the former are reected in latter. hence the physical
interpretation is much less obvious than in algebraic quantum eld
theory. when the euclidean theory has only been proved to exist in
a bounded euclidean domain, as is the case for the four dimensional
yang-mills model constructed by magnen, rivasseau and seneor [17],
the passage itself is an important unsolved problem.

recently d. buchholz and r. verch have proposed a method for im-
plementing in algebraic quantum eld theory ideas from renormaliza-
tion group analysis of short-distance (high energy) behavior by passing
to certain scaling limit theories [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4]. buchholz and verch
distinguish between dierent types of theories where the limit is unique,
degenerate, or classical, and the method allows in principle to extract
the ultraparticle content of a given model, i.e. to identify particles
(like quarks and gluons) that are not visible at nite distances due to
connement. it is therefore of great importance for the physical in-
terpretation of the theory. the method has been illustrated in a simple
model in [5] with some rather surprising results.

this paper will focus on the question how the short distance be-
havior of models dened by euclidean means is reected in the corre-
sponding behavior of their minkowski counterparts. more specically,
we shall prove that if a euclidean theory has some short distance limit,
then it is possible to pass from this limit theory to a theory on mi-
nowski space, which is a short distance limit of the minkowski space
theory corresponding to the original euclidean theory.

the present status of algebraic euclidean eld theory. the tech-
niques of euclidean eld theory [16] have proved to be very powerful for
the construction of interacting quantum eld theory models and often
superior to the method of canonical quantization in minkowski space.
for instance, existence of the 4
3 model as a wightman quantum eld
theory has been established by using euclidean methods [11, 23, 18]
combined with the osterwalder-schrader reconstruction theorem [19].
within a hamiltonian framework essentially only the proof of the pos-
itivity of the energy has been carried out. also in cases where a direct
minkowski space construction is possible, as in the p ()2 and yukawa2
models, euclidean techniques may simplify things considerably, e.g. in
in the proof of of poincare covariance or discussions of phase transi-
tions and symmetry breaking. in these constructions the key objects
are usually the euclidean greens functions, or schwinger distributions,
sn that are represented as moments of a measure d on a space of
distributions s(rd)

sn(x1,    , xn) = z d() (x1)    (xn).

methods from statistical mechanics like renormalization group analysis
[14] and cluster expansions [3] can be applied in order to perform the
continuum and the innite volume limits of lattice regularized mod-
els. but the construction of schwinger distributions is not enough,
the problem of linking them to physics in minkowski space has to be
addressed.

the osterwalder-schrader reconstruction theorems [19] connect the
schwinger distributions of an euclidean eld theory with the wightman
distributions of a quantum eld theory on minkowski space. power-
ful as these theorems are, there are several reasons why they can not
be considered as the nal answer to the problem of linking euclidean
and minkowski space theories. for one thing, the conditions of the
equivalence theorem (theorem e  r in [19]) are extremely hard to
verify, while the convenient sucient conditions for the passage from
schwinger distributions to wightman distributions (theorem e(or
e) r in [19]) are most probably too restrictive in general. sec-
ondly, and this is a more important point than the rst for the present
discussion, the results in [19] do not allow one to conclude that a lo-
cal net of observable algebras in the sense of algebraic quantum eld
theory can be obtained from the schwinger distributions. in fact, the
question when a wightman quantum eld gives rise to such a net is
quite a delicate one, see [1] for a review. useful sucient conditions are
known, however [16, 10]. in the models with point elds constructed
so far these conditions are fullled, but it appears very unlikely that
they will be so in general.

the third point is that schwinger distributions, which are euclidean

3

expectation values of point elds, may not be adequate in gauge the-
ories and one should rather consider expectation values of extended
objects localized around loops or even strings extending to innity.
an osterwalder-schrader-type reconstruction scheme which can be ap-
plied to correlation functions of loops and strings was established by
e. seiler [22] and j. frohlich, k. osterwalder and e. seiler [13]. lo-
cal commutativity of the reconstructed observables remained an open
problem in this work, however.

a c*-algebraic version of the reconstruction theorems in [19, 10,
16], which to a certain extent generalizes the previous considerations
in [13, 22] and solves the locality problem, has been worked out in [20].
the starting point of this analysis is a net a of c*-algebras, indexed
by regions in euclidean space, and acted upon by an action  of the
euclidean group by automorphisms of a. the third ingredient is a
continuous euclidean invariant and reexion positive [16] functional 
on a. it is shown in [20] that for a given euclidean eld (a, , ) a haag-
kastler net a on minkowski space, a covariant action of the poincare
group by automorphisms  on a as well as a vacuum state  on
a can directly be reconstructed from (a, , ). the main advantage
of the c*-algebraic framework, is that one only deals with bounded
operators from the outset. this is also important for the proof of
locality for the constructed haag-kastler net. finally, we mention that
there are indications that a c*-algebraic point of view also enlarges the
variety of constructible euclidean eld theory models [21].

scaling algebras and renormalization group. a general approach
for the analysis of the high energy properties of a given quantum eld
theory model has been developed by d. buchholz and r. verch [9, 8,
7, 6, 5, 4]. the starting point within their analysis is a quantum eld
theory which is given by a (poincare covariant) haag-kastler net

k 1,d1  o 7 a(o)  a

indexed by double cones o  k 1,d1 in minkowski space and a co-
variant action  of the poncare group by automorphisms of a.

the concept of scaling algebra allows to express some basic ideas
of renormalization group analysis within the algebraic framework. for
a positive number  > 0 one builds a new haag-kastler net (a, ) by
dening the scaled algebra of a domain o by a(o) := a(o) and
putting (,g) := g1 where g  p
+ is a poincare transformation.
thus one keeps minkowski space xed and one interprets the properties
of the given theory (a, ) at small scales (high energy behavior) in
terms of the modied theories (a, ).

the scaling algebra as is a c*-algebra which is generated by ap-
propriate sections a :  7 a()  a. a technically precise denition

4

is given in section 3 (see [5] and related work). the sections in a
are regarded as orbits under the action of the renormalization group
transformations r which identify operators at scale 1 with operators
at scale .

each physical state  of the underlying theory (a, ) can be lifted
1 on the scaling algebra by the prescription
1, ai := h, a(1)i, in other words, the section a is evaluated at

to a physical state 
h
scale  = 1.

the group of scaling transformations  acts by automorphism on

the scaling algebra:

(a)(1) := a(1) .

one obtains a net of states

{

 = 

1  |0 < }

which has, according to the weak-compactness of the set of states of a
c*-algebra, weak limit points 
   the symbol  labels such a limit
point  for   0. it has been proven in [8, 5] that all weak limit
points 
  are vacuum states and for each of them one obtaines a
haag-kastler net (a, ) which is the net in the gns-representation
of 
 . these nets are called scaling limit theories and they describe
the high energy behavior of the underlying theory.

d. buchholz and r. verch distinguish three cases in order to classify

the scaling limits of a given theory.

(1) all scaling limit theories (a, ) are equivalent (in the sense of

equivalence of nets), i.e. the scaling limit is unique.

(2) all scaling limit theories are just multiples of the identity, i.e.

one obtains a classical scaling limit.

(3) neither case (1) nor case (2) are valid, i.e. the scaling limit is

degenerate.

improvements of reconstruction theorems. the theorem worked
out in [20], is not in all respects a generalization of the osterwalder-
schrader construction [19]. this is due to that fact, that one assumes
the existence of a nontrivial subalgebra of operators in the euclidean
c*-algebra a which can be localized on a hyperplane at xed euclidean
time. this condition is in [20] called time-zero condition (tz). such
a condition is alien to the osterwalder-schrader framework and there
are indeed examples of quantum eld theories which do not fulll this
condition, for instance the generalized free eld for which the mass
distribution is not l1.

on the other hand, interacting models like the p ()2, the yukawa2
3 model do fulll the condition (tz), so it certainly

as well as the 4

5

does not exclude all interesting cases. nevertheless, it is desirable to
develop a generalization of the construction which also lead directly to
a haag-kastler net but which do not rely on the condition (tz).

analogously to the short-distance analysis for quantum eld theo-
ries [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4], a scaling in conguration space by  requires a
scaling in euclidean momentum space by 1. therefore one is faced
with the consideration of euclidean elds (a, , ) for which the group
homomorphism

  hom(e(d), auta)

is strongly continuous, i.e.

lim
g1

kg(a)  ak = 0

for each a  a.

we expect, however, that such euclidean elds do not satisfy the
condition (tz). in order to overcome this problem, we consider a eu-
clidean eld ( a, , ) which fullls (tz). then we consider the c*-
subalgebra a  a on which  is strongly continuous. it is discussed in
section 2, how to reconstruct from a euclidean eld (a, , ) a quantum
eld without referring to the condition (tz).

euclidean approach to scaling algebras. for or a given euclidean
eld (a, , ) the short-distance behavior can be obtained by rst pass-
ing by means of a reconstruction theorem to the corresponding quan-
tum eld theory model (a, , ) and in a second step applying the
analysis of d. buchholz and r. verch [8, 5] in order to get the scaling
limit theories (a(,), (,), 
 ) where  labels a limit point. we
illustrate this procedure digramatically in the following way:

(a, , )

recon

(a, , )

sclim

(a(,), (,), 

 )

this two step procedure, however, is rather cumbersome and it is ad-
vantageous to be able to study the scaling limit theories directly on
the euclidean level.

vice versa, for a euclidean eld (a, , ) one rst passes to eu-
clidean scaling limit theories (a, , 
 ) and , in a second step, one
constructs the corresponding minkowski quantum eld theory models
(a

conclusion and outlook. we close this paper by concluding remarks
and some comments on further investigations in section 4.

2 from euclidean eld theory to quantum
eld theory

within this section we briey discuss the ideas and strategies which
have been developed in [20] and generalize the construction procedure
to euclidean eld which do not fulll the condition (tz). the start-
ing point in the framework of algebraic euclidean eld theory is an
isotonous net

a : k d  u 7 a(u )  a

of c*-algebras, indexed by the set k d of bounded convex regions in
rd,on which the euclidean group e(d) acts covariantly by automor-
phisms, i.e. there exists a group homomorphism

  hom(e(d), a)

such that for each u  k d one has

ga(u ) = a(gu )

for each g  e(d). for our purpose we require that  is strongly
limg1 kga  ak = 0 for each a  a. in order to
continuous, i. e.
implement the concept of locality within the euclidean framework, we
assume that two operators commute if they are localized in disjoint
regions, i.e. if u1  u2 = , then

[a(u1), a(u2)] = {0} .

7

w
	
	
w
in order to obtain quantum eld theory models, we consider a par-
ticular class of states on a. this class of states consists of all states
 which fulll the axiom of euclidean invariance,   g =  for each
g  e(d), as well as the axiom of reexion positivity which is formu-
lated as follows: let e  sd1 be a euclidean time direction, then we
denote by a(e) the c*-algebra generated by operators which are local-
ized in r+e + e, where e is the hyperplane, orthogonal to e. a state
 is reexion positive if the sesquilinear form

a(e)  a(e)  a  b 7 h, je(a)bi

(1)

is positive semidenite. here je is the antilinear involution

je(a) = e(a)

with e : x 7 2ex + x.

we showed in [20] how to construct from a given euclidean eld
a quantum eld theory in a particular vacuum representation.
in
order to point out the relation between the euclidean eld (a, , )
and the minkowskian world, we briey describe the construction of a
hilbert space h on which the physical observables are represented,
the construction of a unitary strongly continuous representation of the
poincare group on h, as well as the haag-kastler net of local algebras.

step 1: by dividing the null-space of the positive semidenite
sesquilinear form, introduced by equation 1, and by taking the closure,
we obtain a hilbert space h. the corresponding canonical projection
onto the quotient is denoted by

 : a(e) 7 h

and we write  := (1). a unitary strongly continuous representa-
tion of the poincare group

u  hom[p

+, u(h)]

on h can be constructed, which works essentially analogous to the
procedure which has been presented in [13] (compare also [22, 20]).

step 2:

in order to construct the algebra of observables is con-
structed, it is assumed in [20] that the algebra a contains operators
which are localized at sharp times, i.e. we require that the algebra
a(e)  a(e) is large enough (condition (tz)). for a precise formu-
lation of this condition we refer to [20]. as already mentioned, it is
expected that the condition (tz) is violated when one forces the ho-
momorphism  to be strongly continuous.

8

we now present an improved version of the construction procedure

in [20] which do not make use of the condition (tz).

in order to obtain bounded operators on h we make use of the
following lemma. let a(e, s) = a([0, s)e + e), then the following
statement holds true:

lemma 2.1 : for each s  r+ and for each a  a(e, qs), q  (0, 1),
there exists a bounded operator (,s)(a)  b(h) with

k(,s)(a)k  kak

which is uniquely determined by the relation

(,s)(a)(b) = (ase(b))

for each b  a(e).

proof. the result follows by an application of the proof of [16, the-
orem 10.5.5]. (cid:3)

let g  p

+  p+(c). we say that the operator

(,s)(g, a)

:= u(g)[(,s)(a) + (,s)(a)]u(g)  b(h)

is localized in x  cd if a  a(u ) and gue  x with

ue

:= {z  cd|x  u : z = x  (1 + i)(e  x) e} .

let k d

c be the set of all regions x of the form

x = conv(cid:20)[g

gue(cid:21)

with u  k d and   p
+ open. we introduce the von neumann
algebra m(x ) which is generated by operators (,s)(g, a) which are
localized in x and, furthermore, let ac
 (x ) be the weakly dense c*-
subalgebra of m(x ) which is generated by operators

(,s)(f  a)

:= z dp

+

(g) f (g) u(g)au(g)

0 (p

with f  c 
supp(f ). finally, we denote by ac

 (x ).

+) and a  m(x1), such that gx1  x for each g 
 the c*-algebra which is generated

the prescription

ac

9

is an isotonous net of c*-algebras and by putting (,g) := adu(g) we
get a strongly continuous group homomorphism   hom(p
+, autac
 )
which acts covariantly on the net ac
 := h, ai is a
p
 there exists
a function f(a,b)  o(r1,d1 + iv+) which is holomorphic in the open
tube r1,d1 + iv+ and continuous at the boundary such that

f(a,b)(x + iy) = hc

 , a(,x)(b)i .

finally, a net of c*-algebras, which is indexed by the set of double
cones k 1,d1 in minkowski space, can by obtained by just building
for a double cone o the intersection

a(o)

:= \x :x o

ac

 (x ) .

remark:

(1) from each euclidean eld (a, , ) a non-trivial net of c*-algebras,

indexed by complex regions

ac

 : x 7 ac

 (x )

together with a covariant action of the poincare group  can
be constructed. the triple (ac
 ) is a sort of complexied
quantum eld theory model. the data (ac
 ) are always
non-trivial no matter whether (a, , ) fullls the condition (tz)
or not. nevertheless, we are faced with the problem that, in
general, it can happen that the intersection

 , , c

 , , c

a(o) = \x :x o

ac

 (x ) = c1

is trivial for each double cone o  k 1,d1.

(2) let ( a, , ) a euclidean eld, u 7 a(u ) is a net of von neu-
mann algebras u , which fullls the time-zero condition (tz).
then, in general, the group homomorphism  is not strongly
continuous. passing to a subnet u 7 a(u )  a(u ) where
a(u ) is a weakly dense c*-subalgebra of a(u ) for which  is
strongly continuous [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] the condition (tz) might be
violated. on the other hand, the intersection

a(o)

:= \x :x o

ac

 (x )

turns out to be non-trivial for a given double cone o  k 1,d1.

10

we close this section by formulating a slightly improved version of

the construction theorem in [20]:

theorem 2.2 : let ( a, , ) be a euclidean eld which fullls the con-
dition (tz). let a be a dense c*-subalgebra of a such that (a, , ) is
a euclidean eld for which the automorphism  is strongly continuous.
then the prescription

a : o 7 a(o)

together with the group homomorphism  is a p
kastler net and the restriction

+-covariant haag-



:= c

 |a

is a vacuum state.

proof. the proof can by obtained by an application of the analysis
carried out in [20]. (cid:3)

3 on the short-distance analysis of eld
theories

we briey review the concept of scaling algebras which has been in-
vented by d. buchholz and r. verch [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. let (a, )
be either a euclidean net of c*-algebras or a p
+-covariant net of c*-
algebras indexed by complex regions in k d
c , as dened in the previous
section. furthermore let g be the euclidean or the poincare group,
respectively.

for each   r+ we consider the scaled group homomorphism
  hom(g , auta) which is given by (,g) := g1 . the scal-
ing algebras are given as follows: let cb(r+, a) be the c*-algebra of
bounded a-valued functions on r+ then the prescription which is given
according to

((s,g)a)()

:= (,g)a()

yields an action s of g by automorphisms on cb(r+, a). in order to
select the admissible orbits of renormalization group transformations
in cb(r+, a), we consider the c*-subalgebra as in cb(r+, a) on which
s is strongly continuous. in particular, for each x  k = k d, k d
we denote by as(x ) the c*-subalgebra in as which is generated by
elements a  as with a()  a(x ). this denition implies that s
is covariant, i.e. (s,g) maps as(x ) onto as(gx ).

c

11

in order to label the scaling limit theories in a elegant manner, we
consider the c*-algebra cb(r+) of continuous bounded functions on
r+ and the closed two-sided ideal c0(r+) in cb(r+) which is generated
by functions f  cb(r+) with lim0 f () = 0. then we build the
quotient c*-algebra

ca(r+) = cb(r+)/c0(r+)

where the canonical projection onto the quotient is symbolized by p.
the spectrum of cb(r+) and ca(r+) is denoted by xb(r+) and
xa(r+) respectively. note that xa(r+)  xb(r+). the points
  xa(r+) in the spectrum of ca(r+) are called limit points.

for each limit point   xa(r+) we introduce a c*-seminorm on

as according to

kako


:= h, p[ 7 ka()k]i .

the corresponding ideal which is annihilated by k  ko
build the quotient c*-algebra

 is j[a]. we

a

:= as/j[a]

and the corresponding projection onto the quotient is denoted by p.
since the ideal j[a] is euclidean invariant the group homomorphism s
can be lifted to a covariant group homomorphism   hom(g , auta).

let   xa(r+) be a limit point. then the prescription

h

 t, ai

:= h, p[ 7 ht, a()i]i , t  a , a  as

denes a canonical linear map 

 : a  a
s .

proposition 3.1 : for each limit point   xa(r+) the map  maps
reexion positive euclidean invariant states to reexion positive eu-
clidean invariant states.

proof. let  be a reexion positive euclidean invariant state. then
we conclude for each g  e(d)

h

 , (s,g)ai = h, p[ 7 h, (,g)a()i]i

= h, p[ 7 h, a()i]i

= h

and hence 
direction and let a  as(e). then we obtain

  is euclidean invariant. let e  sd1 be a euclidean time

h

 , je(a)ai = h, p[ 7 h, je(a())a()i]i  0

12

since  is a positive functional. therefore 

  is reexion positive. (cid:3)

the observation of proposition 3.1 justies to compare the subse-
quent two step procedures applied to a given euclidean eld (a, , ).

(1) for a given limit point   xb(r+) we rst build the euclidean

within this section we are going to prove that the procedures (1)
and (2) yields equivalent results. this can be formulated more precisely
by the theorem:

as a consequence of theorem 2.2 and theorem 3.2 we get the

corollary:

preparation of the proof of theorem 3.2. for a given euclidean
eld (a, , ) and for each   r+ we consider the euclidean eld
(as, s,

sponding scaling limit (as, s,

proof of lemma 3.4. let b0, b1  as(e) and let l  liee(d) be
the generator of a one-parameter group of rotations which are not
contained in the stabilizer subgroup of e. according to [13], there is
a cone   r+e + e such that for each b0, b1  as() the vectors
[bj()],  > 0, 

 [bj] are analytic for the operators

v( )[bj()] = [ exp( l)1bj ()]

v ( )

 [bj] = 

 [(s,exp( l))bj]

and we obtain local one parameter groups v and v of positive op-
erators with anti-selfadjoint generators b and b respectively. for

14

a family of poincare transformations g = (gj)j=1, ,n and for opera-
tors aj  as(e, qjsj), 0 < qj < 1, j = 0,    , n, we introduce complex
functions

f (n;g,a,b)
(,)

(z1, z2)

:= h[n; g, a, b], u(z1)(,s)(a0())u(z2)[b1()]i

f (n;g,a,b)


 

(z1, z2)

:= h[n; g, a, b], u(z1)(

 ,s)(a0)u(z2)

 [b1]i

with u(z1) = exp(zb) and u(z) = exp(zb) and the vectors [n; g, a, b]
and [n; g, a, b] are given by

[n; g, a, b]

:= u(g11)(,s1)(a1())u(g11)   

   u(gn1)(,sn)(an())u(gn1)[b0()]

:= u

according to the analysis, carried out in [20], the functions f (n;g,a,b)
,
 > 0, and f (n;g,a,b)
are holomorphic in an open tube r2 + ii[a0, b1] 
c2 where i[a0, b1]  r2 depends on the localization regions of a0 and
b1. here we always assume that a0 is localized in a region u such that
exp( l)u  he for some  6= 0. this is not a serious restriction since
a0 can be put in such a position by a appropriate spatial translation.

(,)

there is an open connected subset i [a0, b1]  i[a0, b1], 0  i [a0, b1],

such that the functions (f (n;g,a,b)
bound

since k(b)k  kbk for each b  a(e). here we have made the assertion
that

v(1)(,s0)(a0())v(1)1

is a bounded operator whose norm is bounded by ka0k as long as 1
is small enough. let a  a(e, qs), 0 < q < 1, be an operator which is
localized in a region u such that exp( l)u  he for some  6= 0 and
let b  a(). then we compute

v( )(,s)(a)v( )1[b] = [exp( l)aseexp( l)b]

= [exp( l)aexp( l)s exp( l)eb]

= [exp( l)(a)s exp( l)e(b)]

.

now let l be the generator of the rotations in the ee1 plane, e1  e.
then we have exp( l)e = sin( )e1 + cos( )e which yields

v( )(,s)(a)v( )1[b] = [exp( l)(a)s cos( )es sin( )e1(b)]

.

16

since q < 1, there exists a non-empty interval j  (/2, /2) such
that exp( l)(a) is contained in a(e, q cos( )s), 0 < q < q cos( ) < 1,
for each   j. this leads to the identity

v( )(,s)(a)v( )1 = (,cos( )s)(exp( l)(a))u(s sin( )e1)

and therefore

kv( )(,s)(a)v( )1k = k(,cos( )s)(exp( l)(a))k  kak

which proves the assertion.

by vitalis theorem we conclude that for a limit point   xa(r+)

the prescription

f (n;g,a,b)
(,)

: z

7 h, p[ 7 f (n;g,a,b)

(,)

(z)]i

yields a function which is also holomorphic in r2 + ii[a0, b1].

in the next part of the proof, we show by induction in n that the

functions f (n;g,a,b)

(,)

and f (n;g,a,b)



 

coincide on r2 + ii[a0, b1].

let n = 0, then we compute for (1, 2)  i[a0, b1]

f (0;g,a,b)


 

(i1, i2) = h

 [b0], v (1)(

 ,s)(a0)v (2)

 [b1]i

= h

 , je((s,h1)b0)a0(s,se)(s,h2)b1i .

on the other hand, we nd

f (0;g,a,b)
(,)

(i1, i2)

= h , p[ 7 h[b0()], v(1)(,s)(a0())v(2)[b1()]i] i

= h , p[ 7 h, je(h11 b0())a0()seh21 b1()i] i

= h

 , je((s,h1)b0)a0(s,se)(s,h2)b1i .

with hj = exp(j l). this implies f (0;g,a,b)
theorem.

(,)

now we assume that

= f (0;g,a,b)



 

by the identity

f (n;g,a,b)


 

= f (n;g,a,b)

(,)

holds true. then the boundary values

f (n;g,a,b)


 

(s1, s2) = f (n;g,a,b)

(,)

(s1, s2)

(2)

17

also coincide. we choose families a
0,    , n + 1 and poincare transformations (g

:= (s,exp(1l))a

0(s,se)(s,exp(2l))b

:= b0

and we conclude from the identity (2)

f (n;g,a,b)


 

(s, s) = f (n+1;g,a,b)



 

(i1, i2)

= f (n;g,a,b)

(,)

(s, s)

= f (n+1;g,a,b)

(,)

(i1, i2) .

hence for a family (g, a, b) the functions f (n+1;g,a,b)
coincide on ii[a

 



0, b

1] and we conclude that
f (n+1;g,a,b)


(,)

= f (n+1;g,a,b)

 

and f (n+1;g,a,b)

(,)

by the identity theorem which completes the induction.

this implies that for each g0,    , gn  p

+, for each aj  as(e, qjsj),

0 < qj < 1, j = 0,    , n, and for each b0, b1  as() the identity

by making use of the formula

for each a  a(e, qs), 0 < q < 1, the the lemma follows. (cid:3)

4 conclusion and outlook

for or a given euclidean model (a, , ) the short-distance behavior
can be analyzed by rst passing to the corresponding quantum eld
theory model (a, , ) and then applying the analysis of d. buch-
holz and r. verch [8, 5] in order to get the scaling limit theories
(a(,), (,), 

 ) where   xa(r+) is a limit point.

we have proven that the quantum eld theories, which can be re-
constructed from euclidean scaling limit theories, are scaling limit the-
ories of the quantum eld theory which can be reconstructed from the
underlying euclidean eld theory.

this fact leads us into a comfortable position which can be also
motivated by the consideration of euclidean eld theories with a volume
cuto. to such a model the reconstruction theorems cannot even by
applied. on the other hand, a euclidean counterpart of the analysis
by d. buchholz and r. verch [8, 5] can be formulated for euclidean
eld theory models in the c*-setting as we have discussed during this
paper. the procedure given in section 3 is quite general and it still
makes sense within a nite euclidean volume.

we expect that scaling limit theories of euclidean eld theories
within a nite volume are essentially independent of the volume cut-
o. we propose to regard a nite volume euclidean eld theory in d
dimensions as a eld theory on the scaled d-sphere rsd  rd+1, where
r is the volume cuto. the corresponding euclidean net ar carries a
covariant action of the d + 1-dimensional rotation group o(d + 1) and
the functional r is invariant under this action. for a point x0  rsd,
the stabilizer subgroup of x0 in o(d + 1) is isomorphic to o(d).
if
the scaling limit procedure is performed at x0, the invariance under
the stabilizer subgroup should remain as a o(d) invariance within the
scaling limit. the translation invariance should then enter from the
fact that r is invariant under the full group o(d + 1). note, that r is
replaced by r = 1r for the scaled theory. hence one expects that
the scaling limit theories are models within an innite volume.

keeping in mind that the minkowskian analogue of the euclidean
d-sphere rsd  rd+1 is the de sitter space, it should be possible, by
exploring the analytic structure of de sitter space, to construct from a
given euclidean eld theory (ar, r, r) on the sphere rsd a quantum
eld theory (a(,r), (,r), r ) in de sitter space. according to the
considerations of h. j. borchers and d. buchholz [2] we conjecture
that the reconstructed state r fullls the so called geodesic kms

19

condition, i.e.
equilibrium state.

for any geodesic observer the state r looks like an
