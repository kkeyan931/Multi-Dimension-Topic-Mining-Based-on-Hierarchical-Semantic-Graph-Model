we discuss four dimensional renormalization group ows which preserve sixteen supersym-
metries. in the infra-red, these can be viewed as deformations of the n = 4 superconformal
xed points by special, irrelevant operators. it is argued that the gauge coupling beta func-

tion continues to vanish identically, for all coupling constants and energy scales, for such

rg ows. in addition, the dimensions of all operators in short supersymmetry representa-

tions are constant along such ows. this is compatible with a conjectured generalization

of the ads/cft correspondence which describes such ows, e.g. the d3 brane vacuum

before taking the near-horizon limit. rg ows in three and six dimensions, preserving 16

supersymmetries, are also briey discussed, including a discussion of generalized ads/cft

duality for the m2 and m5 brane cases. finally, we discuss maximally supersymmetric rg

ows associated with non-commutative geometry.

1. introduction

s

16 ordinary ones, qi

four dimensional n = 4 super-yang-mills theories have 32 conserved supercharges:
 and q i , and 16 additional superconformal supercharges, si and
i
, with ,  = 1, 2 spinor indices and i = 1 . . . 4 in the fundamental of the global su (4)r
symmetry. the 16 additional, superconformal supercharges are associated with the fact
that the theory is conformally invariant, with  ( )  0 for arbitrary gauge coupling and
theta angle   
y m . we will here be interested in theories which preserve the
16 ordinary supersymmetries but are not conformally invariant. these are the maximally

2 + 4ig2

supersymmetric renormalization group ows (introducing more supersymmetries either

makes the theory conformally invariant or necessitates adding gravity and other higher

spin elds).

the infrared endpoints of such rg ows are the usual n = 4 superconformal theories
with 32 supercharges. the rg ows can be viewed as these rg xed points with additional

perturbing operators, which preserve the 16 supersymmetries and become irrelevant in the
infrared. the least irrelevant such operator is a dimension 8 operator of the form trf 4 +. . .
(the . . . are terms related by the 16 supersymmetries; in terms of n = 1 supersymmetry, it
2
is r d4tr[w 2
] + . . .); this operator is an su (4)r singlet. there is another dimension
8, su (4)r singlet, scalar operator, which also preserves 16 supersymmetries, given by
trf 2trf 2 + . . .. because these two operators have the same quantum numbers, it is

w

exceedingly dicult to tell them apart (see [1]) so we will not bother doing so. we will
refer to either operator, or a general mixture of them, as oh.

other operators which preserve the 16 supersymmetries are of dimension 8 + n, of the
form trf 4n + . . ., and in the su (4)r representation with dynkin indices (0, n, 0), for
arbitrary integer n  0. again, we will not bother distinguishing between these and multi-
trace analogs of these operators with the same quantum numbers. all of these operators
are in short supersymmetry representations and are of the form q4q

oshort. there are

4

also 16 supersymmetry preserving operators in long representations of the supersymmetry
algebra, whose dimensions can vary with gy m ; these operators are of the form q8q
and thus have dimension larger than 8.

olong

we will argue in the next section that certain properties known to hold for the 4d
n = 4 superconformal xed points continue to hold along rg ows which preserve the 16
supersymmetries. in particular, the gauge coupling gy m and theta angle do not change
with the energy scale  along such ows, i.e.  ( )   d
d  = 0 for all  . even though

1

the theory is not scale invariant, there are exactly marginal operators, o and o , which
deform  and  respectively. this is depicted in gure 1. more generally, there are still

short representations of the supersymmetry algebra and the dimensions of all operators

in such representations are independent of the energy scale along these rg ows. briey,

the argument is that the dimension of the stress tensor is not renormalized, because it is a

conserved current, and that this, along with supersymmetry, is enough to x all operator

dimensions in all short multiplets to also not be renormalized.

figure 1. rg ows to the ir, preserving 16 supersymmetries. coecients h of perturbing

operators ow to zero, while the gauge coupling g remains constant along the ow.

to give a concrete example of a rg ow preserving 16 supersymmetries, consider
deforming a n = 4 superconformal theory by moving away from the origin of the moduli
space of vacua, giving an expectation value to the adjoint scalars , which higgses the
gauge group g to a subgroup such as h  u (1). this deformation leads to a non-trivial
renormalization group ow, with 16 supersymmetries preserved along the entire ow; the

additional 16 superconformal symmetries emerge in the uv and ir limits of the ow.
the uv limit is the n = 4 superconformal theory with gauge group g and the ir limit
is the n = 4 superconformal theory with gauge group h  u (1). the fact that the
including all quantum eects, both perturbative and
gauge coupling  is exactly (i.e.

non-perturbative) constant along such renormalization group ows is well known: e.g. the
seiberg-witten curve for the n = 4 theory gives a gauge coupling which does not depend
on the coordinates of the coulomb branch. (this is a special case of the fact that the
gauge coupling does not depend on the higgs branch moduli in n = 2 supersymmetric
theories because of the decoupling there of vector and hypermultiplets.)

viewed from the ir, the above rg ow is the h  u (1) gauge theory, perturbed by
various irrelevant operators which preserve the 16 supersymmetries, such as the dimension

2

8 operator oh mentioned above. we will consider more general rg ows preserving 16
if necessary, we can
supersymmetries, without worrying about the uv starting point.

imagine that there is a uv cuto, which preserves the 16 supersymmetries, below the

scale where the irrelevant operators might blow up.

as will be discussed in sect. 3, d-branes and ads duality [2] motivate considering

rg ows preserving 16 supersymmetries. in this section we will make contact with the

works [3,4]. we will discuss a conjectured extension of the duality between eld theories

and gravity theories away from the ads limit. for example, iib string theory in asymp-

totically at 10d spacetime (with n d3 branes innitely far away), is conjectured to be
holographically dual to the uv limit of n = 4 supersymmetric su (n ) gauge theory with
a particular choice of irrelevant operators. the value of n is arbitrary.

section 4 is devoted to 3d rg ows with 16 preserved supercharges. the ir xed
points are the 3d n = 8 superconformal theories with 32 supercharges. several peculiarities
are noted. the ows which are associated with m theory vacua containing m2 branes are

discussed.

section 5 is devoted to 6d rg ows with 16 preserved supercharges. the ir xed
points are the 6d n = (2, 0) superconformal eld theories with 32 supercharges. the ows
which are associated with m theory vacua containing m5 branes are discussed.

section 6 discusses maximally supersymmetric rg ows associated with non-

commutative geometry. the rg ow of g. 1, with gy m constant, is veried in the
string vacua which are proposed to be holographically dual to the eld theory rg ows.

in the appendices we list, for convenience, results obtained in [5,6] (see also [7]) on the

short representations of the superconformal group, with 32 supercharges, in 3d and 6d.

2. the power of 16 supersymmetries

recall that the superconformal theory, with 32 supercharges, has two types of operator

m

op , and their conformal descendents. it should be understood that qnq

representations: short and long. the representations are generated by a primary opera-
tor op , along with descendent operators, related to op by supersymmetry, of the form
qnq
op is a
shorthand for a nested graded commutator of the operator op with n of the supercharges
 and m of the supercharges qi , e.g. q2qop should be understood as a shorthand for
qi
[q,{q, [q,op ]}]. the remaining 16 superconformal supercharges, s and s, act on these
representations as lowering operators. for the generic, long, representation, the operators

3

m

qnq

op truncate at n  8 and m  8 by fermi statistics. taking n > 8 or m > 8 in
op gives zero, up to a total derivative. the dimensions of long operators are not

constrained by supersymmetry and depend on gy m as well as the gauge group.

the short representations have the dening property that they instead truncate at
n  4 and m  4; they are the n = 4 version of chiral superelds. the spectrum of short
representations was found in [8] and their table, with our present eld-theory operator

notation, can be found reproduced in [9]. the primary operators which generates the
short representations are op  [trg(p)](0,p,0), where  is the n = 4 scalar in the adjoint
of the gauge group g and the 6 = (0, 1, 0) of the su (4)r global symmetry and (0, p, 0) are

the dynkin labels of the su (4)r representation. in addition, there are multi-trace short
representations with primary operator o(pi)
these primary operators all have dimension  = p, independent of gy m . as mentioned in

p = [qi trg(pi)](0,p,0), with p = pi pi [1].

the introduction, we wont bother distinguishing between single and multi-trace operators

with the same quantum numbers. the descendent qnq

in addition, o2 contains the exactly marginal scalar operators o  q4o2 and o 
o2. these operators can be added to the lagrangian density without breaking any
supersymmetries, as q and q annihilate them up to total derivatives.
indeed, adding
o to the lagrangian changes the gauge coupling    +  , which preserves all the
supersymmetries. adding o also exactly preserves conformal invariance, and thus the
full superconformal group, as o has dimension exactly 4 and is thus exactly marginal.
this corresponds to the fact that the n = 4 super-yang-mills theory has exactly vanishing
beta function for all  ,  ( )  0.

now consider a non-conformal theory, with 16 conserved supercharges. such a theory
can be obtained by starting, for example, with the conformal lagrangian density l0 and
adding terms which are annihilated, up to total derivatives, by the supercharges q and q:

l = l0 +xp

eters1, which we will often refer to collectively as h, as in gure 1. the short multiplet

operator q4q
op is in the (0, p  4, 0) representation of su (4)r (it vanishes, up to total
derivatives, for p < 4). the operator oh  q4q
op=4 is the least irrelevant such per-
turbation and is an su (4)r singlet. again, the short operator op=4 here can actually be
any combination of the single trace operator [trg(4)](0,4,0) and the double trace operator
[trg(2)trg(2)](0,4,0). the deformation (2.1) by the short operators q4q
op>4 break
o(l)
su (4)r for p > 4. there are many long operators q8q
i which preserve the su (4)r
[trg(p)](0,0,0), as well as many
symmetry, for example there are su (4)r singlets in q8q
which break su (4)r.

the deformed theory (2.1) again has short multiplets, with primary operator op in
the (0, p, 0) representation2 of su (4)r given by the same single or multi-trace operators
involving p. these short multiplets again consist of operators qnq
op, with n  4 and
m  4, and with q or q acting on q4q
op vanishing up to total derivatives. indeed,
this is necessary for (2.1) to preserve the 16 supersymmetries (see footnote 1). this is the
n = 4 extension of the statement in n = 1 supersymmetry that chiral operators form
short supersymmetry multiplets, whether or not the theory is conformally invariant.

lets initially restrict our attention to theories (2.1) which preserve the su (4)r sym-
metry. it is then clear that all of the (p + 2)2((p + 2)2  1)/12 operators in the primary
operator op (this is the dimension of the (0, p, 0) representation of su (4)r) must have
the same dimension p. a priori, as the theory is not conformally invariant, p can

1 the notation in (2.1) is slightly deceptive: the supercharges q and q will themselves depend
on the parameters h, so the lagrangian is not necessarily linear in the parameters h. one can nd

the form of the lagrangian via an iterative procedure, rst taking the q in (2.1) to be independent

of the h, then nd the rst order in h correction to q and plug back in (2.1) to nd the next

order correction to q, and so on, until one obtains a lagrangian which is invariant under its
conserved supercharges. this is similar to the situation in n = 1 supersymmetry, where one adds
a superpotential l = q2w + c.c.. the above iterative procedure properly leads to a lagrangian
containing both the linear term w  and the quadratic term  |w |2.

2 we can discuss the su (4)r transformation properties of operators even if (2.1) violates
su (4)r. we can think of the parameters h in (2.1) as expectation values of background elds

which carry charge under su (4)r so that (2.1) is invariant, replacing explicit su (4)r breaking

with spontaneous breaking, much as in [10]. su (4)r thus still constrains the theory and can lead

to selection rules for the h.

5

depend on the rg scale , as well as the gauge group, gy m , and the parameters h in (2.1).
however, we will now argue that this is not the case.

in terms of n = 1 supersymmetry, the real scalars  in the (0, 1, 0) representation
of su (4)r are the bosonic components of chiral superelds  in the 32/3 of su (3)f 
u (1)r  su (4)r and anti-chiral superelds  in the 32/3. the operators op then
contains the bosonic component of purely chiral superelds trp in the [(p+2)(p+1)/2]2p/3
representation of su (3)f  u (1)r, along with the conjugate, purely anti-chiral superelds,
and mixed operators, which contain both chiral and anti-chiral superelds. we now use the
fact that n = 1 supersymmetry implies that the purely chiral superelds form a chiral
ring, with purely additive anomalous dimensions at all scales. thus the purely chiral
superelds trp must have dimensions p = p1 for some 1 which, a priori, might still
depend on the rg scale.

m

2

by the su (4)r symmetry, all operators in op, in the (0, p, 0) su (4)r representation,
must then have dimension p = p1 for all rg scales and coupling constant parameters.
similarly, using the supersymmetry algebra, the supersymmetry descendents qnq
op
must have dimension 1
2 (n + m) + p1 for all rg scales and coupling constant parameters.
even though the theory is not conformally invariant, the conserved currents are given
by the supersymmetry descendents of the o2 operators. as in the conformal theory,
o2 and the conserved supercurrents are q2qo2 and
the conserved stress tensor is q2q
o2. by the discussion above, the stress tensor t will thus have dimension 2 + 21.
but, because t is a conserved current, its scaling dimension can not be renormalized:
it must be exactly 4. thus 1  1 and the dimensions of all short operators are not
renormalized: qnq
2 (n + m) for all rg scales

op has dimension exactly given by p + 1

m

qq

and coupling constant parameters.

in particular, the operator o  q4o2, which can be added to the lagrangian to
change the gauge coupling  , has dimension exactly 4 for all rg scales and coupling con-
stant parameters. thus l  r d4xo is an exactly marginal deformation for all scales
and coupling constants, which implies that the gauge coupling beta function continues to
vanish identically,  (, h)  0, even though the theory is not conformally invariant. the
gauge coupling  does not vary with the rg scale, as depicted in gure 1.

we now relax our restriction that the deformation (2.1) preserves the su (4)r sym-
metry. one might then worry that the dimensions of the dierent operators in op, which
were previously equal as they were in the irreducible (0, p, 0) representation of su (4), could

now be split. but any possible splitting must be compatible with imposing the su (4)r

6

symmetry which can be regarded as being unbroken provided the parameters h in (2.1)
are assigned appropriate su (4)r transformation properties. the only natural choice is to
have the possible splitting of the operator dimensions be a combination of the parameters
h which is in the (0, p, 0) representation of su (r)r. similarly, the possible splittings of the
operators in qop should be in the same representation as this collection of operators, the
(0, p  1, 1) representation of su (4)r. but, for any operator in op with dimension , the
corresponding operator in qop must have dimension  + 1
2 ; this would not be compatible
with having non-trivial splittings of the op operators dimensions in the (0, p, 0) of su (4)r
and qop in the (0, p  1, 1). we thus conclude that all operators in qnq
op which are
related by su (4)r rotations must have the same operator dimensions, even if (2.1) breaks
su (4)r. the above argument that these operators all must then have unrenormalized
dimensions, for all rg scales and coupling constant parameters, then goes through exactly
as in the case where (2.1) respects su (4)r.

m

note that it is necessary to have 16 preserved supersymmetries for the above argu-
ments to go through. for example, if n = 4 is broken to n = 2 (via adjoint masses)
the gauge beta function no longer vanishes. this can happen because the operator o
associated with changing the gauge coupling is no longer in the same supermultiplet as the
conserved stress tensor t , and can thus obtain an anomalous dimension.

finally, the reader might wonder about any possible connections between the non-
renormalization of operator dimensions discussed here and other non-renormalization the-
orems concerning n = 4 theories, which have been of recent interest [11-14] in the context
of the matrix description of m theory. the non-renormalization theorems of [11-14] con-
cern the eective action for the pure n = 4 super-yang-mills theory along the coulomb
branch, where the unbroken gauge group is generically the abelian cartan torus u (1)r of
the gauge group. the low-energy theory is then n = 4, with u (1)r gauge group and 16
supersymmetry preserving deformations, of the form (2.1), which arise via integrating out
the massive gauge bosons of the original gauge group. in this situation, where the scalar

expectation values are generic and the low-energy gauge group is purely abelian, the ir

xed point is a free-eld theory, which is perturbed by the irrelevant operators in (2.1).

because the ir theory is free in this case, the statement of the present paper, that
certain operator dimensions are not renormalized, is essentially trivial in this context. the

non-trivial non-renormalization theorems of [11-14], in the context of the ir free theories,

concerns the exact expressions for the coecients h appearing in (2.1). perhaps it is also

possible to obtain exact expressions for some of the coecients h, appearing in a more
general eective action of the form (2.1), even in our present context, where the ir theory

is non-abelian, and thus not free.

7

3. holography and rg ows

a motivation for considering 4d rg ows with 16 preserved supersymmetries comes

from the ads/cft correspondence [2] and some conjectured extensions. recall that type

iib string theory has vacua with metric

ds2 = h 1/2 dxdx + h 1/2abdyadyb,

(3.1)

with coordinates x spanning r1,3 and ya, which we often write as ~y, spanning r6. h(y)
is an arbitrary function which satises the ya laplace equation, allowing for possible delta
function source terms: yh = 21/2pn
i=1 6(~y~ai), where the ~ai are arbitrary vectors
in r6. these vacua have f5  1(1 + )(dx)4  dh 1, with n units of integrated f5
ux. they generally preserve 16 supersymmetries. a point which we would especially like

to emphasize is that these vacua all have constant axio-dilaton  , for arbitrary  in the

upper half plane. we will connect this with the statement in the previous section that
  0 with 16 supersymmetries.

a special case, which preserves the so(6) = su (4) symmetry of rotating ~y, is

h = h +

r4
r4 ,

(3.2)

where h is an arbitrary real constant, r4  4gs2n  n /25/2, and r2 = abyayb 
~y~y. choosing the constant h = 1, the metric is the d3 brane metric [15], which asymptotes
for r   to at, 10 dimensional space-time. for r  0, there is a tube in r with an s5
section of radius r and non-singular horizon at r = 0. rather than choosing h = 1, one
could take h = 0, which is the ads5  s5 vacuum of iib string theory. the two cases,
h = 1 and h = 0, are clearly asymptotically the same in the near horizon limit, r  0, but
dier drastically for r  . while the h = 1 case approaches at 10d space-time in this
limit, the h = 0 case always remains ads5  s5, with the ads5 coordinate r approaching a
boundary which ads5 has at r  . it is this boundary (rather than the horizon) where
operators are inserted in the prescription of [16,17].

the h = 1 case preserves 16 supersymmetries for generic r and asymptotically pre-
serves an additional 16 supersymmetries in the limits r  0 and r  . in the r  0
limit, the symmetries combine into the supergroup p su (2, 2|4), which is the 4d n = 4
superconformal group. the h = 0 case, ads5  s5, identically has the p su (2, 2|4) super-
conformal symmetry group, with the 32 supersymmetries, for all r.

8

the works [18,19,20] considered the h = 1 case and compared the asymptotic scatter-
ing of bulk waves from r   to the dynamics of the world-volume gauge theory of the
d3 brane. similarly, [21] started from the h = 1 case and then conjectured duality with
the world-volume gauge theory in the r  0 near-horizon limit.

by starting instead with the h = 0 case, it is not necessary to take the near horizon

limit: the h = 0 case is conjectured to be holographically dual, for all energies and for all
r, to n = 4 super-yang-mills, with gauge group su (n ). the fact that the dilaton is an
arbitrary constant  corresponds to the fact that the n = 4 super-yang-mills theory is
exactly conformally invariant for arbitrary  . the fact that the h = 0 case has symmetry
group p su (2, 2|4) for all r shows that the holographic dual is precisely the n = 4 super-
yang-mills theory and not, for example, some deformation of this theory, such as born-

infeld, which would not be exactly conformally invariant.

on the other hand, following [3,4] we would like to interpret the case with h 6= 0 as
being holographically dual to a deformation of n = 4 super-yang-mills. interpreting r as
the renormalization group energy scale parameter, this deformation ows to the n = 4
superconformal xed point in the infrared, r  0, as h becomes irrelevant in this limit.
the deformation of n = 4 is thus by operators which become irrelevant in the ir. in [3]
the deformation was regarded as the replacement of the n = 4 yang-mills lagrangian
with a born-infeld generalization (though no such non-abelian n = 4 born-infeld action
is known as of yet). a simpler possibility for the ir irrelevant deformation was conjectured
in [4] on the basis of p su (2, 2|4) representation theory. this will be discussed further in
what follows. (we also mention the possibility that the seemingly simpler deformation
actually is n = 4 born infeld.)

the more general vacuum solution is given by (3.1) with

h(y) = h + 4gs2

k

xi=1

ni

|~y  ~ai|4 ,

(3.3)

for some integers ni and vectors ~ai in r6. for h = 1 this corresponds to separating

n = pi ni d3 branes, placing ni at ~y = ~ai. we can choose the origin of ~y so that
pi ni~ai = 0. the general solution (3.3) does not preserve su (4)r but, again, does

preserve 16 supersymmetries. also, we again emphasize that the dilaton is constant with

the general solution (3.3).

we note that the metric (3.1), with (3.2), is invariant under the transformation:

x  x,

r  1r,

h  4h,

d5  d5,

(3.4)

9

with  an arbitrary real parameter and gs and  held xed. similarly, the more general
solution (3.3) is invariant under the transformation

x  x,

~y  1~y,

h  4h,

~ai  1~ai.

(3.5)

this transformation leaves f5  1(1 + )(dx)4  dh 1 invariant, so it preserves the
f5 ux quantization condition. this transformation is a symmetry of the full, interacting,
iib supergravity, with the various elds, e.g. f5, the anti-symmetric b elds and, in
particular, the dilaton, all invariant.

we expect that the above transformation is an exact symmetry of the full iib string

theory in these vacua with f5 ux. for h = 0, this symmetry is the exact gauge sym-
metry of the string theory vacuum under the dilatation element of the symmetry group
p su (2, 2|4). it is on a similar footing as the full translational invariance of the at r1,9
vacuum of iib string theory. in the eld theory dual, the transformation (3.4) or (3.5) are
interpreted as the renormalization group ow, with   0 in the uv and    in the
ir. the fact that ~y or r scale oppositely from x is the well-known uv-ir correspondence
[22]. the fact that gs = g2
y m is invariant under this transformation corresponds to the
fact that the yang-mills gauge coupling beta function vanishes identically along rg ows.

for h = 0 and all ~ai = 0, the invariance under (3.4) corresponds to the fact that the
dual theory is conformally invariant and thus unchanged by rg ow. for h 6= 0, this
symmetry is broken, but can be regarded as being restored provided h transforms as in

(3.4). in other words, the transformation of h as in (3.4) exactly compensates for the fact

that the theory is not invariant under scale transformations, with the theory unchanged

under the combined transformation (3.4). this means that, at length scales x, the theory
only depends on h via the eective coupling hef f  h/x4, which is invariant under (3.4).
similarly, for ~ai 6= 0, the transformation in (3.5) indicates that the theory only depends
on this parameter via the invariant combination ~ai,ef f  ~aix.

we interpret the power of x in hef f  h/x4 as showing that, in the holographic dual
4d eld theory, h is a coupling constant which multiplies a term of energy dimension exactly
4 in the action s, i.e. a term of energy dimension exactly 8 in the lagrangian density l.
for any xed h, hef f indeed vanishes at long distances, x  , which is the statement
that the theory ows to the conformal n = 4 rg xed point in the far ir. similarly, the
parameters ~ai correspond to scalar ~ expectation, which higgs su (n )  s(qi u (ni)).
the fact that the theory only depends on ~ai,ef f  ~aix is simply the statement that ~ has
exact energy dimension 1.

10

we now argue that the theory actually only depends on h via the dimensionless

quantity hef f = hr4/x4. consider the scale transformation

(3.6)

unlike (3.4) and (3.5), the metric (3.1) is not invariant under (3.6), but rather scales as
ds2  2ds2; also unlike (3.4) and (3.5), the string tension (and thus the gravitational cou-
pling ) scales under (3.6). since   (length)2 and ds2  (length)2, the transformation
in (3.6) amounts to a rescaling of all lengths by a factor of . since all lengths in string
theory are measured relative to , iib string theory and all of its scattering amplitudes

must be invariant under (3.6). because the absorption probability for waves scattered
from r =  to r = 0 do not depend on r, the scaling of r in (3.6) is immaterial. the
essential point is that the absorption probability only depends on h via the dimensionless
quantity hef f = hr4/x4, which is invariant under (3.4), (3.5), and (3.6). we have chosen
to write hef f in terms of r rather than  because the leading order supergravity results
depend on , gs, and n via the combination r4  4gs2n . away from the leading
order supergravity limit, there can be additional explicit dependence on gs and n .

similarly, ~ai,ef f = ~aix/r2 is the quantity which is invariant under (3.5) and (3.6).
so the conjecture is that iib string theory in the vacuum (3.1) with (3.2), for general

h, is holographically dual to the 4d eld theory with lagrangian

l = l0 + (const.) hr4oh ,

(3.7)

where l0 is the lagrangian of the n = 4 superconformal theory, with gauge group
g = su (n ), and oh is an operator, of dimension exactly 8, which preserves 16 su-
persymmetries, and which preserves the su (4)r symmetry. oh is thus q4q
op=4, where
op=4 can, again, be a combination of [trg(4)](0,4,0) and [trg(2)trg(2)](0,4,0). for
h = 1, this was originally conjectured in [4] based on the fact that oh is the unique scalar
su (4)r singlet (besides o and o ) in the short representations of p su (2, 2|4).

4

as mentioned in footnote 1, the deformation (3.7) is actually not linear in h, as the
o4 get h dependent corrections from (3.7). it is interesting to

supercharges in oh = q4q
speculate that perhaps (3.7) actually generates the full n = 4 born infeld lagrangian.

in line with our discussion in the previous section, the gauge coupling should be an

4

arbitrary constant, for all rg scales, with the lagrangian (3.7). this is clearly the case in

the holographic gravity dual, as the axio-dilaton is an arbitrary constant with the vacuum

11

(3.1) and (3.2) or (3.3).

in particular, it does not vary with the coordinate r, which

corresponds to the rg scale. also, based on (3.4), we argued that h should multiply

an operator of dimension exactly 8 in the lagrangian, and this should be the case for

arbitrary h. this is in line with our argument in the previous section that the dimensions

of operators in short representations are not modied by deformations (2.1), of which (3.7)

is a special case.

while the dimension 8 operator oh is the unique short representation operator which
could enter in the conjectured eld theory dual (3.7) of iib string theory with (3.1) and

(3.2), there could also be long operators, as in (2.1), which preserve the 16 supersymmetries
and su (4)r. consider such an operator q8q
olong, of operator dimension (gy m ), which
generally depends on gy m . to preserve the invariance under (3.4), the parameter h would
have to multiply such a term in the lagrangian with a power h((g)4)/4. this gy m
dependent power of h would lead to a non-trivial gy m rg running, in contrast to the

8

fact that the axio-dilaton remains constant. it thus seems likely that (3.7) is actually the
exact 3 holographic dual of iib string theory with (3.2), without any additional short or

long operators, for any gy m and n .

the above, conjectured, duality between the iib string theory with (3.2) and the eld

theory with (3.7) is conjectured to hold for all rg scales.
in particular, the uv limit
of this ow corresponds to r   and thus gives a eld theory which is holographically
dual to the asymptotically at 10-dimensional, minkowski space-time! note that we are

dening the uv limit of a rg ow in terms of an irrelevant perturbation of the ir xed

point, i.e. dening the uv theory via reversing the rg ow. this requires ne-tuning the

coecients of every irrelevant operator so that the lagrangian is exactly (3.7) at all scales.

as already mentioned, the invariance (3.4) is to be interpreted as rg ow in the dual

eld theory. the correlation functions of operators in the dual eld theory thus satisfy a

corresponding ward identity

(3.10)

by the argument of the previous section, the dimensions i of operators in short repre-
sentations are not renormalized and are independent of h.

in particular, (3.8) implies that 2-point functions are of the form

ho(x)o(0)ih =

c
x2 f(hef f , gy m , n ),

(3.11)

where c is a h-independent constant, hef f = hr4/x4, and f(hef f ) is a function which
can be normalized to equal 1 for hef f = 0, which is the far ir limit. for long operators, the
dimension  appearing in the exponent in (3.11) could also be a function (hef f , gy m , n ).
however, for short operators, as we have argued in the previous section, the dimension 

is an unrenormalized constant, independent of gy m , h, and the rg scale. for example,
the 2-point function of o with its conjugate operator o should be given by (3.11) with
  4.

this can be compared with the calculation of [4], where the dilaton 2-point function

was computed in the theory with h = 1 via a supergravity computation of the correspond-

ing partial-wave absorption cross section. restoring the h dependence via the argument
which follows (3.6), the result of [4] is4

ho (x)o (0)i =

3(n 2  1)

4x8

f (

hr4
x4 ),

(3.12)

for a function f (t) which was determined in terms of solutions of mathieus equation.

note, in particular, that this is indeed of the form (3.11), with the x exponent, 2 = 8,
an unrenormalized constant and not a non-trivial function (hef f ) of hef f = hr4/x4.

4 as discussed in [9] all leading supergravity results for correlation functions are proportional
5  n 2  1, with the replacement of n 2 by n 2  1 presumably coming from a

to h1  r32
one-loop string correction to the relation between 10 and 5 in s 5 dimensional reduction.

13

so the result of [4] is compatible with our statement that the dimension of o is not
renormalized. a scale-dependent renormalization of the dimension of o was obtained in
[4] because the right hand side of (3.10), involving t 
 , was omitted. again, the fact that
the dimension of o is precisely 4, for all rg scales and h, agrees with the fact that the
gauge coupling is an arbitrary constant, which does not change with the rg scale. this

agrees with the fact that the dilaton is constant, independent of r and x, for the vacuum
(3.2).

the function f (t) of (3.12) is given by [4] as

f (t) =



n

xn=0

xk=0

cn,ktn( 1

2 log t)k,

(3.13)

with coecients cn,k which are independent of gy m and n , at least in the large n limit,
and given in [4] via a complicated expression. the rst few terms quoted in [4] are

c0,0 = 1

c1,1 = 320
c1,0 = 1024

c2,2 = 571200

c2,1 = 4408560

c2,0 = 14

3 (1422697  120002).

this can be compared with (3.7), which gives

hyi

oi(xi)ih = he(const.) hr4r d4yoh (y)yi

oi(xi)ih=0.

(3.14)

(3.15)

the constant appearing in (3.7) and (3.15) can be t so that (3.15) reproduces, say c1,1.
the rest of the cn,k appearing in the function f (t) of (3.12) should then be completely
determined by (3.15); it would be interesting to complete this check. perhaps the equations
of [4] for the function f (t) can be obtained directly using (3.9) with t 

  hr4oh .

the above considerations can be similarly applied for the more general vacuum (3.3),

which corresponds to the theory with lagrangian (3.7), deformed away from the origin of

the moduli space of vacua, where su (n )  s(qi u (ni)).
as a particular example, consider the theory with h = 4gs2((n  1)/|~y|4 + 1/|~y 
~a|4), where we shifted the ~y origin for convenience. this is expected to be dual to the
rg ow from the n = 4 superconformal theory with gauge group su (n ) in the uv and
su (n  1) u (1) in the ir (large ~y is the uv and small ~y is the ir). the least irrelevant
operator ir, along which the theory ows to the ir xed point, is oh  q4q
o4. the
coecient of this operator is  1/v4, where v is the higgs expectation value which breaks

4

14

su (n ) to su (n  1) u (1). we can also see this from the above h(~y), which is given by
h(y)  h = 4gs2((n 1)/|~y|4 +1/|~a|4)+. . . for small ~y. the ir theory thus eectively
has h(y) given by (3.2) with h = r4/n|~a|4. if we identify v  a/r2, the coecient hr4
of oh is indeed 1/v4. using the analysis of [23] it should be possible to nd the precise
relation between v and a/r2 and, by comparing with the precise coecient of oh induced
by the above higgsing, obtain an independent derivation of the constant appearing in (3.7).

it would be interesting to complete this exercise and to compare the value of the constant

thus obtained with that required to reproduce (3.13) and (3.14) via (3.15).

4. three dimensional theories with 16 or 32 supercharges

we now consider three dimensional gauge theories with 16 supercharges, which is
sometimes referred to as n = 8 supersymmetry in 3d. useful aspects of these theories
can be found in [24]. the supercharges are 8 so(2, 1) spinors qi
, where i = 1 . . . 8 and
 = 1, 2 is the lorentz spinor index. the supersymmetry algebra admits an so(8)r
automorphism, with i taken to reside in the 8s; the yang-mills lagrangian is invariant
only under an so(7)r subgroup for general gauge coupling gy m . the three dimensional
theory can be regarded as the dimensional reduction of the 4d n = 4 theory on a circle
of radius r  0. the su (4)r = so(6)r of the 4d theory then extends to the so(7)r
symmetry of the lagrangian and the so(8)r symmetry of the supersymmetry algebra;
under so(6)r  so(7)r  so(8)r, the supercharges combine as 4 + 4  8s  8s.

as opposed to the situation in 4d, in 3d the gauge coupling gy m is classically dimen-
sionful, owing to strong coupling in the ir. it is believed that the coupling ows until
it reaches some xed point value g
y m where the beta function vanishes and the theory is
conformally invariant and interacting. at this point, the theory has a total of 32 super-

charges (the original 16 and 16 additional, superconformal ones), which combine into the
superconformal group so(3, 2|8).

the superconformal group so(3, 2|8) again has both short and long representations,
with supermultiplets generated by primary operators op via graded commutators with
, which we again denote by qnop . here n  16 for the long multiplets and n  8
qi
for the short multiplets. the extremal cases q16olong or q8oshort can be added to the
lagrangian without violating the 16 supersymmetries as, up to total derivatives, they are

annihilated by the supercharges. these deformations of the superconformal theory are all

irrelevant in the far ir.

15

the short multiplets of o(3, 2|8) were constructed in [5]. they are given by scalar
primary operators op  trp of dimension p = 1
2 p and in the (p, 0, 0, 0) representation of
so(8)r, along with descendents qnop, for n  8, with  = 1
2 n and other quantum
numbers as reviewed in appendix a. the representations with p < 4 are shorter than the

2 p + 1

generic short representation, as the operators in the table in the appendix which would

otherwise have negative so(8)r dynkin weights actually vanish. for example, the case
p = 1 is the singleton representation, given by scalars o1, in the 8v of so(8)r with  = 1
2 ,
and fermions qo1, in the 8c of so(8)r with  = 1; acting with more powers of q on o1
gives zero (up to total derivatives). this p = 1 multiplet is that of the gauge invariant
operators in u (1) gauge theory, with one of the 8 scalars in o1 identied as the dualized
photon: da = d8.

as in four dimensions, the p = 2 short multiplet contains the conserved currents.
 (which may or may not be conserved) are the descendents q2o2,
the so(8)r currents j a
the supercharges are q3o2, and the conserved stress tensor t is q4o2. because t is
denitely a conserved current, its dimension must always be exactly  = 3.

now, as in sect. 2, we consider a deformed theory, as in (2.1), with 16 supersymmetries
preserved. the dimension of t remains exactly  = 3 and thus the dimension of o2
remains exactly 1. as in 4d, the chiral ring structure of additive anomalous dimensions
for chiral superelds then ensures that all short operators qnop continue to have their
unrenormalized dimension  = 1
2 (p + n), even in the deformed theory, with arbitrary

deforming parameters h in (2.1).

as an aside, we mention some peculiar aspects of the 3d theories:

1. in 4d, the microscopic, non-abelian, yang-mills elds are in the p = 1 short multiplet

representation of the supersymmetry algebra. the situation in 3d is dierent because

the p = 1 multiplet contains dualized scalars rather than gauge elds. while 3d

abelian gauge elds can always be dualized to scalars, it is not known how to do this
for non-abelian gauge elds. note also that the p = 1 multiplet in 4d contains o1
descendents up to q2o1 and q
o1 (which is why this multiplet is sometimes referred
to as the doubleton rather than singleton multiplet), while the p = 1 multiplet in
3d only contains descendents up to qo1.

2

2. unlike the situation in 4d, the p = 2 short multiplet in 3d does not contain an operator

associated with changing the gauge coupling gy m . the only candidate for such an
operator would be a lorentz scalar in q4o2, which is the 3d analog of the operators

16

o and o in 4d. but this operator vanishes in 3d (up to total derivatives); this can be
seen in appendix a because the scalar in q4op is in the (p 4, 0, 0, 2) representation
of so(8)r and must vanish for p < 4. for p  4 q4op is not annihilated by the
supercharges (up to total derivatives), so there is no value of p for which it can be

added to the lagrangian while preserving 16 supersymmetries.

the fact that there is no short multiplet operator associated with changing the gauge

coupling gy m actually prevents a contradiction. the rg ow associated with gy m chang-
ing with rg scale, until it hits the rg xed point value g
y m , is one which preserves 16
supersymmetries. thus, by the argument above, the dimensions of all operators in short

representations are not renormalized along this rg ow. but the dimension of the opera-

y m and becomes irrelevant in the ir, for gy m = g

tor responsible for changing gy m must vary with the rg ow, such that it is relevant for
gy m  g
y m (the intuition is that the
xed point at g
y m is attractive in the ir). if the operator responsible for changing gy m
were q4o2, it would always be exactly marginal, which we know to be untrue even for
small gy m .

we thus expect (though with some confusion) that the operator associated with chang-

ing gy m is actually a long operator which preserves 16 supersymmetries.

as another peculiar aside, note that the pseudoscalar operator q2o2  tr can be
added to the lagrangian without breaking the 16 supersymmetries. the reason is that
q acts on this operator to give the spin 1
2 operator in q3o2, which vanishes up to total
derivatives. as seen in the table in appendix a, the spin 1
2 operator in q3op is in the
(p  3, 1, 1, 0) of so(8)r and must thus vanish for p < 3. so q2o2 is a relevant pseu-
doscalar perturbation, with   2, which preserves 16 supersymmetries. this pseduoscalar
deformation is associated with fermion masses.

we now turn to a holographic duality motivation for considering 3d rg ows with 16

preserved supercharges. it is expected that m theory has exact vacua with metric [2]

ds2 = h 2/3dx2

 + h 1/3(dr2 + r2d2

7);

h = h +

252n l6
p

r6

,

(4.1)

where x span r1,2, and there is g4 eld given by g4  l3
p (dx)3  dh 1, with n units
of m 2 brane g ux. m theory has no dilaton, which corresponds to the fact that the

dual [21] 3d theory has no exactly marginal operator: the theory is conformally invariant

for a xed value of the gauge coupling constant gy m . the parameter h in (4.1) is again

17

arbitrary. taking h = 0, the vacuum (4.1) is exactly ads4  s7. taking h = 1 gives
the m 2 brane metric, which asymptotes to r1,10 for r   (far from the brane) and to
ads4  s7 for r  0 (near horizon limit).

in [21] the vacuum was originally taken to be the h = 1 case of (4.1), but then the
near horizon limit, r  0, was taken, leading to ads4  s7 in the limit. one could
instead take h = 0 from the outset. the h = 0 case exactly preserves 32 supersymmetries,
which combine with the bosonic generators to give the 3d superconformal group so(3, 2|8).
this theory is expected to be exactly dual to the 3d su (n ) yang-mills theory with 16
supersymmetries at the rg xed point value of the coupling constant, g

y m , where the
theory is conformally invariant (and thus has an additional 16 superconformal symmetries).
for h 6= 0, the vacua (4.1) generally preserve 16 supersymmetries, with an additional 16
supersymmetries emerging in the r  0 and r   limits. this case is conjectured
to be holographically dual to a eld theory with a non-trivial rg ow along which 16

supersymmetries are preserved.

m theory in the vacuum (4.1) is expected to be exactly invariant under

x  x,

r  1/2r,

h  3h,

d7  d7.

(4.2)

this operation preserves the metric (4.1), g4  l3
p (dx)3  dh 1, and the other super-
gravity elds. for h = 0, (4.2) is a symmetry which corresponds to the dilatation generator
of the superconformal group so(3, 2|8); this must be an exact gauge symmetry of the m
theory vacuum in order for the theory to be holographically dual to the exactly conformally
invariant 3d eld theory. for h 6= 0 this symmetry is broken, but can be regarded as being
restored provided that h transforms as in (4.2). thus, at length scale x, h enters only via
hef f  h/x3 (here x3  (xx)3/2), which is invariant under (4.2).

we thus nd that the operator by which the theory is deformed for h 6= 0 has dimension
 = 6 (dimension 3 in the action). as in the 4d case, this is twice the dimension of a

marginal operator. this was also noted in [3] via an absorption calculation.

now consider the transformation

x  x,

lp  lp,

h  3h,

r  3/2r,

(4.3)

p (dx)3  dh 1 is
under which the metric (4.1) transforms as ds2  2ds2 and g4  l3
invariant. because all lengths in m theory are measured relative to lp, m theory should

18

be invariant under the combined rescaling (4.3) of lp and ds2. the upshot is that h should
only enter via hef f = hl3
p/x3, which is dimensionless and invariant under (4.2) and (4.3).
we thus propose that m theory in the vacuum (4.1) is dual to the 3d n = 8 eld

theory with lagrangian

l = l0 + (const.) hl3

poh ,

(4.4)

where l0 is the superconformal lagrangian at g
4d case (3.7).

y m and oh = q8o4, much as in the
(again, as in 4d, the operator o4 can actually be a combination of a
single and a double trace operator with the same quantum numbers.) the theory (3.7)

properly preserves 16 supersymmetries and the so(8)r symmetry, as does (4.1). also,
h properly couples to an operator of dimension  = 6. (in d spacetime dimensions a
scalar  has canonical dimension 1
2 (d 2), so q8()4 always has dimension 2d.) the fact
that q4o4 continues to have dimension  = 6, even in the deformed theory (4.4) with
h 6= 0, is compatible with our argument above that the dimensions of short representation
operators are not renormalized as long as 16 supersymmetries are preserved. there are

also many long operators which preserve the 16 supersymmetries and are so(8)r singlets,
but deforming by these would not be compatible with the deformation depending only on
hef f = hl3

p/x3, so we do not expect them in (4.4).

as in the 4d case, correlation functions in the proposed dual eld theory for h 6= 0 are

given by

hyi

oi(xi)ih = he(const.) hl3

pr d3yoh (y)yi

oi(xi)ih=0.

5. six dimensional theories with 32 supercharges and rg ows preserving 16

much work points to the existence of interacting 6d superconformal eld theories with
32 supercharges residing in the superconformal group so(6, 2|4). these supercharges are
the 16 of n = (2, 0) supersymmetry in 6d, along with 16 superconformal partners. the
superconformal group again has short and long representations. the short representations
of the 6d superconformal group so(6, 2|4) were obtained in [6] and are given in appendix
b for convenience. for example, the p = 1 multiplet is the (free) 6d n = (2, 0) matter
multiplet, consisting of scalars o1 in the 5 = (0, 1) of sp(2)r = so(5)r, fermions qo1
in the 4 = (1, 0) of sp(2), and self-dual tensor elds q2o2 in the 1 of sp(2)r. the
notation a, listed in the table for the lorentz spin of q2o2, is to indicate that these

are two-form gauge elds with self-dual eld strength.

the rg xed point theory can be deformed as in (2.1), preserving the 16 supercharges.

the p = 2 short multiplet again contains the currents: the so(5)r currents are the  = 5
lorentz vectors q2o2, the supercharges are the  = 5.5 gravitinos q3o2, and the stress
tensor is the  = 6 lorentz graviton q4o2. again, the stress tensor remains conserved
when the theory is deformed as in (2.1), and thus its operator dimension is not renormal-

ized. the chiral ring structure of additive anomalous dimensions for chiral superelds then

ensures that the dimensions of all operator in short representations are independent of the

rg scale, and not renormalized, in rg ows which preserve 16 supersymmetries.

such a 6d rg ow, preserving 16 supersymmetries, can be the holographic dual of m

theory vacua containing m 5 branes. it is expected that m theory has exact vacua [2]

where x span r1,5, and there is g4 eld given by g4  l6
p (dx)6  dh 1, with n

asymptotes to r1,10 for r   and to ads7  s4 for r  0. for h = 0, (5.1) is identically
ads7  s4, with 32 conserved supercharges, for all r. the h = 0 case is expected to
be exactly holographically dual to the 6d, an 1 type, n = (2, 0) conformal eld theory.
the h = 1 case is expected to be holographically dual to a rg ow which preserves 16
supercharges and ows in the ir limit, r  0, to the same cft as in the h = 0 case.

m theory in the vacuum (5.1) is expected to be exactly gauge invariant under

p (dx)6  dh 1, and the other su-
this operation preserves the metric (5.1), g4  l6
pergravity (and m theory) elds. we again interpret this symmetry as that associated

with the dilatation generator of the superconformal group, which is spontaneously broken
for h 6= 0 but can be regarded as being restored provided h transforms as in (5.2). the
eective parameter which is invariant under (5.2) is hef f  h/x6; this power of x reveals
that h multiplies a term of exact dimension 12 in the lagrangian density (dimension 6 in

the action).

now consider the transformation

x  x,

lp  lp,

h  6h,

r  3r,

(5.3)

p (dx)6  dh 1 is
under which the metric (4.1) transforms as ds2  2ds2 and g4  l6
invariant. because all lengths in m theory are measured relative to lp, m theory should
be invariant under the combined rescaling (4.3) of lp and ds2. the upshot is that h should
p/x6, which is dimensionless and invariant under (5.2) and (5.3).

m theory with vacuum (5.1) is thus expected to be holographically dual to the 6d

eld theory with lagrangian

l = l0 + (const.) hl6

poh ,

(5.4)

where, l0 represents the conformal theory and again, oh = q8o4, which is an so(5)r
singlet and now has  = 12, as required above. ((5.4) is perhaps schematic as the theory

contains non-abelian, self-dual tensor elds which do not have a known, standard la-
grangian formulation.) the fact that oh has dimension  = 12 even in the theory with
h 6= 0 is compatible with the above argument that the dimensions of operators in short
representations are not renormalized as long as the 16 supersymmetries are preserved.

the deformation of the xed point by a dimension  = 12 operator is compatible with

the scattering results of [3].

6. non-commutative geometry and maximally supersymmetric rg ows

there has been recent interest in gauge theories in non-commutative spaces; such

theories arise in the world-volume of branes with background b eld (or, in m theory, the
c eld). the non-commutativity of space-time, [x, x] = i , introduces a length scale
via the parameter , which clearly has mass dimension  = 2. thus the maximal
supersymmetry for  6= 0 is the 16 ordinary supercharges, without the superconformal
symmetries, and there is a rg ow to the ir, where  becomes irrelevant. the ir xed
points are the ordinary, superconformal n = 4 yang-mills theories on commutative space,
with 32 supercharges. the non-commutativity thus leads to maximally supersymmetric

rg ows, of precisely the type discussed in the previous sections.

indeed, it was argued in [25] that non-commutative gauge theories can be related to

ordinary gauge theories by a eld-redenition of the gauge eld strength, order-by-order
in the parameter ; the explicit change of variables can be found in sect. 3.1 of [25].

thus the non-commutative theory with 16 supercharges is equivalent to an ordinary theory

with 16 supercharges with higher dimension terms in the lagrangian, exactly as in (2.1),
coming from the eld redenition; these terms are weighted by powers of  and become

irrelevant in the ir.

suppose e.g. that we start with a 4d (other d are similar) lagrangian which is formally
the same as the n = 4 superconformal lagrangian, but is not conformally invariant simply
because the space-time is non-commutative. via the change of variables of [25], this should

be equivalent to the ordinary gauge theory with lagrangian

l = l0 + [q2q

o3] +   [q

with  and    the lorentz spin (1, 0) and (0, 1), respectively, parts of  . the operators
q4o3]   are dimension  = 6 short operators and
[q2q
oh = q4q
o4 is the  = 8 short operator; all of these operators are su (4)r avor singlets
and annihilated by the 16 supersymmetries, so (6.1) respects the expected symmetries of

o3]  (trf 3) + . . . and [q

2

22

non-commutative n = 4.
of . however, any terms of higher order in  in (6.1) must be long operators which

in principle, there should be terms in (6.1) at higher orders

preserve the 16 supersymmetries and su (4)r, as there are no other short operators which

respect these symmetries. the fact that the dimensions of the short operators appearing in

(6.1) are not renormalized along the rg ow of (6.1) is consistent with the expected non-
renormalization of the dimension,  = 2, of the parameter  appearing in [x, x].
on the other hand, the coecients of possible long operators appearing in (6.1) would

have to have quantum-corrected anomalous dimensions, to compensate for the anomalous

dimensions of the long operators to which they couple.

the arguments of the previous sections apply directly here. the 16 supersymmetry

rg ows associated with non-commutative geometry will have short operators, with non-

renormalized dimensions along the entire rg ow. in the 4d case, the gauge coupling must

thus remain constant along the rg ow, exactly as in g. 1.

string (or m theory) vacua with non-zero b (or c) eld and their conjectured holo-

graphic duality to world-volume eld theories were discussed in [26-28]. these vacua have

16 supersymmetries. for example, the case associated with iib vacua with d3 brane charge

(the m2 and m5 cases are similar) has [26,27], in our earlier notation, exact vacua:

str = h 1/2[f1(dx2

h = h +

e = g0pf1f2,

2b01 = tan 1h 1f1,

2b23 = tan 2h 1f2.

the j are dimensionless free parameters, as is g0  0. as in the previous sections, we
conjecture that iib string theory in the general vacuum (6.2) is holographically dual to a
deformed n = 4 supersymmetric theory (2.1), with 16 supersymmetries, even away from
the near-horizon limit of [26-28].

the ~y dependent dilaton in (6.2) seems to contradict our arguments of sect. 2 that

gy m must be independent of the rg scale. fortunately, it is wrong 5 here to simply
identify e with g2
y m . (rather, e is the suppression factor for non-planar diagrams [29].)

5 i am grateful to n. seiberg for pointing this out to me.

23

the point is that the supergravity solution (6.2) should be regarded as giving the

closed string quantities, whereas the worldvolume gauge theory is sensitive to open string

quantities [25]. well assume that we can directly apply the formulae of [25],

gij = gij  (2)2(bg1b)ij,
g + 2b(cid:19)ij
ij = 2(cid:18)

to the non-at background (6.2). doing so, we obtain for the open string metric and ij,

ds2

the worldvolume gauge coupling obtained via (6.3) is

(6.5)

remarkably, the non-trivial functions fi of the ads bulk coordinate ~y appearing in

open and g2

(6.2) all completely cancel out of the open string quantities! up to constant rescalings,
y m are unaected by the b eld. the ~y independence of the ij in (6.4)
ds2
shows that these eld theory parameters are  = 2 constants, which are otherwise
not renormalized. this is as should have been expected from [x, x] = i . the ~y
independence of g2

y m in (6.5) is in agreement with the general considerations of sect. 2:
the dual eld theory rg ow is indeed as in g. 1, with gy m constant along the entire

rg ow.
