abstract

new equations governing the scale transformation behaviors of a
qft with underlying structures is derived and they are valid for all
qfts (with whatever renormalizability). these equations, with their
several equivalent versions, can yield some new and signicant insights
and results that are dicult to see in the conventional renormalization
programs. among the several equivalent versions, one is similar to the
usual callan-symanzik equation and renormalization group equation
but with dierent meanings. from another version, the anomalous
equation of energy-momentum tensor trace can be easily obtained.
it can shown that with the new versions one could partially x the
scheme dependence and hence some renromalization schemes like mo-
mentum space subtractions are questionable. the classical results like
asymptotic freedom are reproduced and some related issues are dis-
cussed. finally the decoupling theorem a la appelquist and carrazone
are discussed within our strategy.

1 introduction

according to the standard point of view, the qfts beset with uv unphys-
ical innities could be seen as corresponding to the eective sectors of the
well-dened and complete underlying theory without uv (as well as ir) trou-
bles. the present qfts are just ill-dened formulations of the well-dened
sectors in the underlying theory. from this point of view we proposed a
natural strategy for calculating radiative corrections without introducing ad
hoc regularizations and uv innities [1].

in this report, we will derive the equations governing the scale transfor-
mation behavior of the qfts with the existence of underlying structures for
making the uv (to focus on the main topic we assume from now on the ir
ends are ir regular) ends of the eective qfts well-dened. our deriva-
tion does not require anything about the renormalizability as will be clear
below. thus the equations obtained are valid for all qfts as long as they
are consistent and/or physically relevant. for the renormalizable cases, the
new equations are just new versions of the conventional callan-symanzik
equations [2].

this paper is organized in the following way: in section two we derive the
equations governing the scale behavior of an arbitrary qft with the under-
standing that we work in an underlying theory version of it where all objects
are uv (and ir) well dened [1]. then we give new versions of the callan-
symanzik (cs) equation and renormalization group equation (rge) [3] in
section three. the operatoral form of the cs equations, i.e., the anomalous
trace equation of the energy-momentum tensor is also given. in section four,
we will elaborate on the harmony revealed by the new scale wt identities
and on the implications of this notion together with the new equations. we
will expend some time on the important issue of the decoupling theorem
`a la appelquist and carrazone [4] in section ve in the underlying theory
approach we proposed. all these new achievements clearly demonstrate the
power and rationality of our proposal [1]. in section six we summarize our
presentation.

2 underlying structures and scale anomalies

before starting the derivation, we briey review our strategy and its conse-
quences [1] : suppose that the complete and well-dened underlying theory
is found, then it must contain certain additional parameters or constants
characterizing the correct uv structures underlying the present qfts. the
latter can be now formulated without any (uv) ill-denedness in the under-
lying theory. as the underlying structures are too small comparing to the
scales of the eective theories the eective theories are eectively dened in
the limit that the underlying structures vanish. but this does not mean that
the underlying structures are totally decoupled. on the contrary, as pointed
out in ref.
[1], the underlying structures do inuence quite nontrivially
through certain agent constants that are not included in the present qft
formulations. the well-dened formulation of the qfts are in fact dened
in terms of by the canonical model constants of qfts and the agent con-
stants, in other words, the qfts should inherently contain more parameters
than given in the hamiltonian.

now let us begin our derivation. consider a general complete vertex
function (or a 1pi green function), (n)([p], [g]; {}) given in the underly-
ing theory with [p], [g] denoting the external momenta and the lagrangian
couplings (including masses) and {} denoting the underlying parameters or
constants. now it is easy to see that any well-dened vertex function must
be a homogeneous function of all its dimensionful arguments, that is

(n)([p], [dg g]; {d}) = d

(n) (n)([p], [g]; {})

(1)

where d refers to the canonical scale dimension of a parameter or canonical
mass dimension of a constant (eective and/or underlying).

in the limit (l{}) that the underlying structures vanish, there will neces-
sarily arise some well-dened agent constants {c} mentioned above [1], then
eq.(1) becomes

(n)([p], [dgg]; {dcc})  l{}(n)([p], [dgg]; {d})

= d

(n) (n)([p], [g]; {c})  dn l{}(n)([p], [g]; {}).

(2)

note that these constants only appear in the loop diagrams of certain vertex
functions or in the pure quantum corrections. the limit operation will lead
to a local part of certain vertex functions with their coecients as functions

3

of the agent constants c and the largrangian constants 1. in all the following
deductions, it is understood that for any equation derived in the underlying
version ((; {})) there is a paralell version dened in terms of the agent
constants {c}. let us work in the underlying version rst.
now the dierential equation version of eq. (1) reads

n

{

xi=1

pi  pi +x dggg +x d  d(n)}(n)([p], [g]; {}) = 0.

(3)

all the scale or mass dimensions are canonical here. obviously the constants
with zero canonical mass dimensions do not cause any violation of the scale
bahavior. eqs. (1) to (3) are valid for any qft provided they are mathe-
matically consistent and/or physically eective. renormalizability is simply
not in concern here. as is clear from the equations, the scale anomalies are
caused by the indispensible existence of the underlying structures.

note that the operation dggg in the above equations is an insertions of
certain local operators into the vertex function under consideration, which
in turn is equal to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor () for the
qfts in concern (it is an easy excercise to check this). thus we arrive at
the following,

n

{

xi=1
= i(n)

pi  pi +x d  d(n)}(n)([p], [g]; {})

 ([0; p], [g]; {})

(4)

eq.(3) or equivalently eq.(4) is just the most general underlying structure
version of the ward-takahashi identity for scale transformation in (eective)
qfts. the anomalies in the eective qfts are canonical behaviors in the
underlying theory point of view as the underlying constants  are featuring
constants there. the paralell equation of eq.
(3) in terms of the agent
constants {c} read

n

{

xi=1

pi  pi +x dccc +x dggg  d(n)}(n)([p], [g]; {c}) = 0.

(5)

1here the notation c takes a dierent meaning in constrast to ref. [1] where we use c
to denote just the denite coecients of the local part of a vertex function. later we will
denote the coecients of the local vertices as {c}

4

eq. (3) and (5) are valid as a wt identity not only order by order but also
graph by graph. it is very clear that the agent constants take over all the
responsibilities originally held by the underlying structures {}. they are
inherent in the well-dened forms of the qfts. they are not residing
in the tree graph section of the theories but only in the pure quantum loop
graphs.

now we note the following obvious fact: since the agent constants are
arguments of the coecients (co;([g]; {c})) of the local part of certain vertex
functions loop graph (denoted as ), the variations in these agent constants
will nally lead to the insertions of the local vertex operators ([o]). some
of these composite vertex operators are just given by the lagrangian. then
the insertion of some of these operators can be realized by the variation
with respect to the couplings in the lagrangian (the insertion of the kinetic
operators and others that can not be found in the lagrangians will be denoted
by the general denotation, io). that is, with the following facts valid for the
complete vertex functions,

o;([g]; {c})  dco;([g]; {c})  x{c}
x dccc = x{o;}
dco;co;co; = x{cl}

x{cl}
x{cn }

dclclcl = x[g]
dcn cn cn = x{on }

g([g]; {c})gg +x{}

dc

cco;
co;c

,

dclclcl + x{cn }
([g]; {c}) i,

dcn cn cn ,

(6)

(7)
(8)

(9)

we can turn eq.(5) into the following forms,

{ + x{co;}

dco;co;co; +x[g]

dggg  d(n)}(n)([p], [g]|{co;}) = 0,

on

{ + x{on }
d(n)}(n)([p], [g]|{co;}) = 0,

ion +x[g]

(g + dg)gg +x{}

 i

(10)

(11)

in above the insertion of the kinetic vertex of a eld  is denoted as i. 
or dc denote the coecients before the inserted composite operators. (a

5

vertex functions dependence upon the agent constants is eected through
the local coecient constants after the vertical bar.) eq.(10) is true order
by order, graph by graph while eq.(11) is only true for the complete sum
of all graphs and all orders (or sum up to a certain order). the constants
{c} must satisfy all the above equations as functions of the agent constants
and the eective model constants that are classically dened. thus one
can view the above equations as constraints imposed by the most natural
facthomogeneityupon these constants. moreover, the equations above are
readily true for the correlation functions of composite operators as long as
one works in the underlying theory version or its eective theory limit.

although in eq.(11) we have rewritten some of anomalies in terms of the
insertions of the composite operators appearing in the lagrangian, they are
specifying the scale behaviors of the theoriess quantum structures, not
that of the classical constants.
in fact they describe the inuences of the
normal scale behaviors of the underlying structures unpon the eective
qfts. later, in section four, we will discuss more closely about this point
followed by some signicant conequences which have not been achieved in
the conventional renormalization programs.

3 new versions of callan-symanzik equation

and rge

in this section we limit our attention to a special type of theories where

there is no variations in certain local vertices (those denoted by p dcn cn cn

in last section) that can not be realized through insertions of the lagrangian
operators. in conventional terminology, we consider in this section only renor-
malizable theories.

without the variations necessarily described by p dcn cn , eqs. (10) and

(11) should take the following form,

dclclcl  d(n)}(n)([p], [g]|{c}) = 0,

{ +x dggg + x{cl}
{ +x(g + dg)gg +x  i  d(n)}(n)([p], [g]|{c}) = 0,

(12)

(13)

these are just some of new versions of the cs equations for renormalizable
theories. before turning them into more familar forms,let us rst make the
following conceptual elaboration.

as remarked in section two, the most striking dierence between [g] and
{c} is that the former are dened in the tree level vertices while the
latter begin to appear only in loop amplitudes. the classical constants
[g] or the tree level vertices alone can not yield a well-dened denition of
the quantum structures of elds for theories with potential uv divergence2.
but the incompleteness of the constants [g] or the unavailability of {} by
now does not mean that there must be divergence. of course among {}
or their quantum agents {c} that characterize the quantum paths, there
must be ones with mass dimensions specifying the eective quantum motions
scale(s). in our opinion, this is the physical basis of the necessary appearance
of a mass or energy scale in any regularization/renormalization scheme. in
ref. [1], these scales naturally appear in indenite integrations.

on the other hand, the locality of the appearance of these quantum agents
does allow a mix among [g] and the agent constants (through {c([g]; {c})})
for the complete vertex functions or their generating functional in a special
type of theories. suppose there are scale transforms in the agent constants,
then

x{c}
= {x[g]

dccc(n)(   |{c([g]; {c})}) = x{c}
ggg +x{}

 i}(n)(   |{c([g]; {c})})

which is equivalent to

dccc(n)(   |{c([g]; {c})})

(14)

dccc}(n)(   |{c([g]; {c})})

{x{c}
= {x{c}

dccc  x{c}
dccc x[g]

ggg x{}

 i}(n)(   |{c([g]; {c})}) = 0. (15)

it is easy to see that the invariance in eq.(15) is in fact a rearrangement
of the classically dened parts and that arising from quantum loops or a

2in this sense, the present standard quantization procedures are not absolutely well-
dened as they have not been able to specify the quantum agent constants for such theories.
for more detailed elaboration of this point please refer to ref.[5]

tautology of the fact that agent constants changes only aect the elementary
like local vertices as evident in eq.(14). this is our new version of the
renormalization group equation [3].

the above equations parametrize all scale anomalies as contributions from
each possible kind of vertices. now let us turn the kinetic terms contribtuion
into more familiar forms. this can be achieved by noting that the coecient
constants in the kinetic vertices only renormalize or rescale the line mo-
menta in the graphs. for example, for the fermions, this is just the rescaling
of ip/  (1 + c)ip/ 3. similarly for bosons, ip2  (1 + c)ip2. since the
lines must end up in various vertices, such rescaling of lines would eectively
lead to the rescaling of vertices and be shared by the latter in pairs. thus

a vertex is typically rescaled as qi(1 + ci)1/2qj(1 + cj )1/2 depending on

the number of line momenta that join it. for an n-point 1pi vertex function
there must be n external momenta ow into or out of a number of elementary
vertices in the graphs. these amputed external legs are left unscaled form
the line momenta rescaling then there must be compensated rescaling for
these vertices containing external momenta. this eect would be an overall
rescaling of the complete n-point vertex functions. thus the line momenta
rescaling nally yields that


g  g  (g  ng;
2
g  g  (g  or), dg 6= 0;
(n,n)  (1 + c)n/2(1 + c)n/2(n,n).

), dg = 0;


2

 ng;

then the above equations take the following forms:

{ +x(g + dg)gg + n


2
(n,n)([p], [g]|{c}) = 0,

+ n


2

 d(n,n )}

(16)

(17)

{x{c}

dccc x[g]

ggg  n


2

 n


2

}(n,n)([p], [g]|{c}) = 0.

(18)

3we prefer to express such nite renormalization in terms of the various vertices and
lines appearing in graphs as these are the original places where the agent constants or the
coecient constants really appear.

8

one can see that eqs.(17) and (18) take exactly the same form as the usual
cse and rge. but we must emphasize again here that everything here is
given in terms of the classical constants [g] and agent constants. one might
take the [g] as our nite bare constants.

now some remarks are in order:
(1). in above each equation is given in terms of the classically dened
constants [g] and the quantum agents (unknown to us) denitely dened in
the complete underlying theory, no divergence and hence no innite renro-
malization is needed. in the conventional schemes, divergence is inevitable
due to the articiality of the regularization methods and hence innite renor-
malization is necessary. then after subtraction, one needs to reidentify
the originally classically dened constants with a product of two singular
objectsbare quantities and the renormalization constants.

(2). conventionally, the innite bare quantities are in fact regularizarion
scheme dependentdierent divergnce in dierent schemes, therefore scheme
dependence is inherent there as innite renormalization only transforms the
expressions not the essence.
in the underlying theory point of view this
problem lies in the articiality of the regularization schemes for simulating
the true underlying structures 4. there should be only one physical scheme,
the one with the true agent constants selected by the nature together with
the classically dened lagrangian constants apart from some redenition
freedom for the special type theories described in eqs. (14), (15) or (18).

let us take qed as an example for demonstration.
the cs equation and rge in conventional renormalization schemes read

respectively [6]

{ + (1 + mr)mrmr  r + naa  n + d(na,n )}
(na,n)([p], mr, r) = 0;
{  mrmrmr + r  naa  n}(na,n)([p], mr, r) = 0.

(19)

(20)

4conventioanlly, it is believed that the scheme dependence is only inherent in the per-
turbative truncations not in the full renormalized theory, basing on the expectation that
the low energy theories are independent of the short distance structures and hence inde-
pendent of regularization schemes. this is not correct as though the underlying constants
do not show up in the eective theory, they do aect the eective theories through their
agent constants. as is shown above, the scale anomalies are just the evidences of the
inuences of the underlying structures. otherwise, why bother choosing regularizations?

9

while to write down our new version cse and rge for qed we need to
be specic on the following aspects: among the agent constants there is at
least one mass scale parameter, we will denote it as  and parametrize them
into one mass scale and a series of constants {ci;0}with zero mass dimention
so that the coecients take the following form

cm = cm(m, e; ) + cm;0({ci;0}),
ce = ce(m, e; ) + ce;0({ci;0}) = c,
ca = ca(m, e; ) + ca;0({ci;0}).

(21)

where the ward-takahashi identity is used. then from eqs.(12) to (18) we
can write down our new cse and rge in several equivalent versions as
follows

{ + mm + dcmcmcm + dcacaca + dc cc  d(na ,n )}
(na,n)([p], m, e|{cm, ce, ca, c})

= { + (1 + m)mm + eee + a ia +  i  d(na ,n )}

(na,n)([p], m, e|{cm, ce, ca, c})

e
2

ee + na

= { + (m + 1)mm +

a
2
(n)([p], m, e|{cm, ce, ca, c}) = 0;
{  dcmcmcm  dcacaca  dccc }
(na,n)([p], m, e|{cm, ce, ca, c})

+ n


2

= {  mmm  eee  a ia   i}

(na,n)([p], m, e|{cm, ce, ca, c})

2
(na,n)([p], m, e|{cm, ce, ca, c}) = 0.

ee  n

 n


2

e
2

}

 d(na ,n )}

(22)

(23)

now we can compare our new cse and rge in (22) and (23) with the
conventional ones in (19) and (20). the anomalies are all described in our
equations in terms of the classical constants m, e or () and the agents , c,
in the conventional renormalization schemes the anomalies are given in terms
of the renormalized constants mr, r depending on an arbitrary scale  via
the innite renormalization constants. in the lowest order, from the denition

10

in the conventional renormalization schemes [6] the correspondence should
be

mr  m  (m  ); (r) = 2a  a  2e; 2  .

(24)

we note again that the equations expressed in terms of the coecient con-
stants directly are valid order by order and graph by graph as well as for the
complete sum or sum up to a certain order while the ones given in terms of
the lagrangian vertices are only valid for the complete sum or sum up to
certain order (so it is with the conventional cse and rge).

now we have derived the equations governing the scale transform behavior
of qfts with underlying structures. the new equations are totally given in
terms of classically dened model constants and the agent constants that have
not been predicted but are extremely important for a complete denition
of the eective qfts. no divergence should be there at all which are
artefacts of ad hoc regularizations. we have given several equivalent forms
of equations, one only in terms of the agent constants, one in terms of local
vertex insertions and one takes the typical form of the conventional cse
and rge but with no innite renormalization. each is suitable for dierent
purposes. the utility and power of the conventional form of cse and rge
has been well known. below and in section four we will demonstrate the
utility of the other two versions that has not expected in the conventional
frameworks.

to exhibit the utility of the version in terms of the operator insertion, we
simply mention that once we translate it into the operatoral form, it is just
the anomalous trace equation of quantum energy-momentum tensor, since
all the quantum eects all well dened here and all the eects have been
given in terms of known quantum operators.
in this version, there is no
explicit dependence on the external momenta. thus one can just read the
trace equation from the operator insertion version, for qed this is simply

g = (1 + m)m  +

af f  i d

1
4

= (1 + m  )m  +

1
4

af f.

(25)

in the last step we have used the motion equation of electrons. considering
the correpondence in eq. (24), this is exactly the operatoral trace anomaly

11

equation for qed [7] in a new version with no divergence and innite renor-
malization. one can do so for ohter theories. in unrenormalizable theories,
the trace anomalies would contain an innite sum of local composite opera-
tors beyond the lagrangian operators.

in next section we will illustrate the correctness of our new wt iden-
tity or new cs equation in unconventional versions in several examples and
demonstrate their physical utility and signicance.

4 harmony contraint on the agent constants

{c}

from the experiences above it is also easy to derive the wt identity of scale
transformation for generating functional of vertex functions of a qft from
homogeneity,

{x{}z ddx[d  x  x)(x)]

1p i([], [g]; {c}) = 0



(x)

+x[g]

dggg +x{c}

dccc  d}

(26)

with d denoting the spacetime dimension. again this is correct for any qfts
with internal consistency.

from section two we see that the well-dened vertex functions or their
generating functional for a qft must be homogeneous with respect to all
the dimensional parameters and constants which must include the underly-
ing structures or their agents. that is to say, for this homogeneity to be
valid in a well-dened formulation the underlying structures are indispensi-
ble. therefore in the underlying theory point of view the scale transform
is in perfect harmony in the following sense: when all the arguments scale
up together according to their normal scale or mass dimensions the vertex
functions(al) must then exhibit exact scale behaviors. this is the harmony
principle we wish to advocate that is understandable only in terms of under-
lying structures.

then this harmony leads to a natural explanation for the scale or trace
anomaly. on one hand, in terms of the underlying theory formulation, there
is no scale anomaly. the scale behavior is denite and normal once the
formulation is given. in the course of scale transformation of all elds and all

12

constants, there should be generally tranformations into each other (just like
any symmetry transformation) in a denite way and each parts variations
that are not scale exact must have been absorbed or cancelled by other parts
to preserve the overall homogeneity. then as we only eectively observe
the relatively low sectors variables and their behavior, the nonexact scale
variations of the eective variables that should be absorbed by the underlying
structures variations are therefore exposed. this is exactly what the eq.(1)
(and its equivalents) is expressing in terms of the underlying constants or
their agent constants. thus it is equally correct to interpret the anomalies
as the normal contributions of underlying strucutres and as the anomalous
behaviors of the eective sectors that should be unambiguous in terms of the
canonical variables of eective theories 5. they are the two faces of the same
thing. chiral anomaly can be understood in similar way [9]. we wish this
harmony principle could be generalized to other tranformation behaviors of
the eective theories [10].

all our derivations and arguments has been presented with the assump-
tion that the underlying theory version of the qfts are known. of course
this is not true. then we must try to determine them otherwise. however,
as we have emphasized for times, there are quite many constraints for these
unknown constants or to reduce the ambiguities associated with them, say,
the novel symmetries of the eective qft systems.
it is known in gauge
eld theories that gauge invariance reduces the number of ambiguities (or
the number of independent divergences in conventional terminology). here
with the harmony notion elaborated above, further important constraints
upon the ambiguities can be imposed. this scale harmony has in fact locked
the scale behaviors of the agent constants with that of the denite parts of
the eective theories and hence the ambiguities are further reduced. now let
us enumerate some examples to illustrate the validity of our new cs equa-
tions and the role of ambiguity reduction of these equations in the notion of
harmony.

first let us see that the scale anomalies are denite at 1-loop level (let
us still work in qed) in electron self-energy (1), electron-photon vertex

5we had shown elsewhere [8] and will further demonstrate below that scale or trace
anomaly is in fact due to the presence of a kind of rational terms that are nonlocal
(hence denite at least in 1-loop level). the presence of this kind of rational terms is
unambiguous or independent of regularization schemes. it is in this sense the anomaly is
a denite property of qft.

13

(1)
 and photon polarization . for simplicity let us consider the cases
of massless electrons. as for the expressions of these objects in terms of
the unknown agent constants, one can use any regularization to compute
the denite part and just leave the ambiguous local part as an ambiguous
polynomial of external momentum. or one can use the technique introduced
in ref.
[1] to compute these objects without introducing any ad hoc regu-
larization but simply assuming the existence of the well-dened underlying
version.(we will also explain this technique for applications later.) it is suf-
cient to parametrize the agant constants with one dimensional constant 
and a number of dimensionless constants. then from homogeneity we nd
that

(1)(p, p) = i

(1)

 (p, 0|p) = +i

(1) (p, p) = i

({c0})];

e2
162 p/[ln

p2
2 + 2p/p/p2 + c0
p2

e({c0})];

a({c0})].

(27)

here all the constants are meant for 1-loop case and the superscript 0 of the
constants means that these constants are dimensionless and independent of
any dimansional constants. the symbol  refers to gauge parameter and it is
well known that the electron self-energy and electron-photon vertex at 1-loop
are gauge dependent. then these objects have scale anomalies in terms of
canonical variables only (here only momentum)

{p  p  1}(1) = i

e2
82 p/;

{p  p}(1) = +i

{p  p  2}(1) = i

e2
82 ;
e2
62 (p2g  pp).

(28)

now if we include the agent constants contributions, which is  (the
dimensionless agent simply do not aect scale behavior), then we can recover
the exact scale behavior or the exact scale harmony in the version with
explicit agent constants which is valid order by order, graph by graph:

{p  p +   1}(1) = 0;

14

{p  p + }(1) = 0;
{p  p +   2}(1) = 0.

(29)

this is just what we have remarked about the underlying structures roles
in the scale transformations. the dimensional agent constant  must appear
in the vertices as ln2.they must compensate the unambiguous anomalies
from the denite and nonlocal parts.
(but the other dimensionless agent
constants remain undetermined by the scale wt identities.) it is easy to see
the anomly in each 1-loop vertex above is due to logarithmic dependence upon
momentum which upon the action of p  p yields a local term from a nonlocal
one: (p  p)lnp2 = p( 2p
p2 ) = 2. or if one starts with the insertion of the
dilatation current into the elementary vertices there should be an unbiguous
rational term in terms of momentum only like  pp

the way, we note that the conventional version of cse and the one in terms
of vertex insertions can not hold order by order and graph by graph but only
for the complete vertex functions or sums up to certain order.

p2 = q p. by

if one sums the verices up to 1-loop level with tree graph vertices included

she/he could get the vertex insertion version as follows,

it is easy to see that the anomalies are independent of mass. one can
recalculated the 1-loop corrections of the above vertices in the massive case
with the technique we proposed in ref. [1] or replace the polynomial parts of
any regularizations result with an indenite one and see that the anomalies
should also be mass independent. here we just list the photon polarization
case given by chanowitz and ellis [11],

where the anomaly is exactly the same as in the massless case.

now if we include the  operation amd that of the mass, there should
not be any anomaly as all dimensional arguments are harmonically consid-
ered. thus the anomaly must be assumed up by the dimensional agents
varioation, or the dimensional agent must be locked in this way with the
denite anomaly,

ca(m; {, c0

i }) = 2

 ca(m; {, c0

i }) = ln

m2 + ca({c0

(35)

(36)

where the only dimensional constants besides the agent  is fermion mass
here 6. thus from the agent constants version, we can locked the behavior
of the underlying structures acted by their agent(s). or the agent constants
must appear in the form expressed in eq.(36) at least at 1-loop level. the
same is true for the other 1-loop elementary vertices like fermion self-energy
and the yukawa gauge coupling vertex. as a matter of fact this is true
for all qft in all spacetime dimensions. this is quite a natural conclusion
following from the standard underlying theory point of view. however, this
could not have been achieved in the conventional renormalization programs
where the agent constants version of the scale ward-takahashi identity could
never be derived as the articiality in regularization has driven us into wrong
direction.

therefore according to the foregoing discussions, the subtraction schemes
eected at euclidean momentum are questionable for the massive case. while

6one can easily see the homogeneous dependence on 2

m2 by noting that if the nonpoly-
nomial momentum dependent part has mass to fulll the homogeneity, then the coecients
must depend on mass in this way. one can also see this point by directly solving the scale
wt identity of the polarization tensor in the agent constants version, i.e., using eq. (12)
or (5) that is valid graph by graph.

16

the ms and ms schemes in dimensional regularization (dr) are not subject
to question this moment 7. here we must mention that the dependence on
the agent constants in the way specied in eq.(36) is conventionally subject
to the nondecoupling diculty [13]. this is in fact not a real challenge by
noting that in the well-dened eective formulation ln 2
m2 is correct only when
the limit l{} is valid with repsect to all eective parameters like momenta,
masses, couplings and the agents. when a mass goes to innity, the expres-
sions that have been obtained by assuming it is nite are no longer true. we
will make further dicussions on this issue in section ve.

the natural appearance of the dimensional agents in the way dictated in
eq. (36) can also be technically understood in the following way. first we
need to briey review the technique we proposed solely based on the existence
of the underlying structures for providing well-dened formulations [1] as
follows: for a 1-loop graph g of supercial divergence degree g  1 [14]
with its underlying version amplitude denoted as g([p], [g]; {}), we have

g
[p] l{}g([p], [g]; {}) = l{}g

[p] g([p], [g]; {})

[p] g([p, k], [g]; {})] = z ddk[g

= l{}z ddk[g
= z ddkgg([p, k], [g]; {}) = g
[p] ]1g

g})  [g

g ([p], [g]),

g([p], [g]; {cg([g]; {c})}) = l{}g([p], [g]; {}) 
g([p], [g]; {cu

g ([p], [g])

[p] l{}g([p, k], [g]; {})]

(37)

(38)

where g
[p] and its inverse denote the dierentiation (for  times) with respect
to the external momenta (one can do the same with respect to masses in cer-
tain cases like for tadpole graphs) and the indenite integration respectively.
we can not get the denite agent constants or the coecient constants but
a set of unknown constants {cu
g} instead in our technical treatment. the
justication of eq.(37) is basing on the natural assumption that the under-
lying structures make the qfts well dened and the low energy limit does
not alter the well-denedness.

7this is not to say the dr schemes are totally ok. in our opinion, the ambiguous
local terms should be in a general lorentz covariant form while the dr schemes and
the like might sometimes oversubtract with some reasonable nite parts removed and are
therefore questionable in certain applications like in the low energy nuclear processes [12].
the most crucial point is that all regularization schemes are ad hoc ones contain various
ill-denedness.

17

our above analysis implies that these unknown constants are to be dened
as the true agents through various physical properties. but there must be
at least one constant of mass dimension among the constants {cu
g} as the
result of the indenite integration though its precise value are to be xed
otherwise and it must be present in the polynomial part of g([p], [g]; {cu
g})
and appears as  ln 2
m2 where m is a mass among the model constants [g].
this can be seen by observing that the amplitude g
g ([p], [g]) must take the
following form (with appropriate feynman parametrization)

g

g ([p], [g])  z 1

0

[dx]f ({x})

l([p], [gm]|{x})
[q([p], [gm]|{x})]

(39)

with l(  ) and q(  ) denoting respectively the linear and quadratic expres-
sions of the combination of dimensional parameters like external momenta
and masses with the help of feynman parameters {x}. then on the rst step
indente integrattion with respect to the external parameters a logarithmic
expression is generated with an arbitrary mass scale entered for balancing
the mass dimension of the argument in the logarithmic expression,

zindef

dpg

g ([p], [g])  z 1

0

[dx]f ({x})ln( q([p], [gm]|{x})

2

) .

(40)

further indenite integrations with respect to the external parameters of
mass dimension would necessarily carry on this mass scale in the polynomial
part.
if one trades the  in the logarithmic function with a model mass
constant so that the nonpolynomial function of momenta only involve model
mass parameters, the  would only appear in the polynomial part in the form
of ln 2
m2 just as we claimed through scale anomaly analysis. the multiply-
ing factor of this logarithmic function is nothing else but the anomalous
dimension of the corresponding local operator overt of a vertex:overt([g0]).
thus at least at 1-loop level, for all local ambiguities, we can claim that:

c overt([g]; {, c0

i }) =

1
2

 overtln( 2

m2) + c 0

overt

({c0

i }).

(41)

the superscript 0 indicates that its principal is totally independent of any
constants with nonzero mass dimension.

one can check this in any model with our technique proposed in ref.
[1]. we will provide more examples of calculations in the proposed technique

18

in future reports, expecially in the nonperturbative case where the conven-
tional regularization schemes often yield more severe divergences. our tech-
incal proposal can be very naturally generalized to the mulptiloop cases and
many conventional subtlties like overlapping divergences are automatically
resolved, please refer to ref. [1] 8.

before closing this section we simply demonstrate that the typical asymp-
totic freedom of qcd can be easily reproduced in our new version of cse.
the new version cse for the eective strong coupling constant gs reads,

{ + gsgsgs +x(1 + mi)mimi}ef f (p, gs, [mi]; {, c0
gs is equal to  1
of (= g2

consider the massless case or the high energy end situation. noting that
a according to eq. (16) and rewriting the cse in terms

j }) = 0.

s /(4)), we have

2 (1)

(42)

{  a}ef f (p, ; ) = 0

(43)

where we have simply assumed that the constants independent of any mass
scale is zero or absorbed into the mass scale. expanding ef f in series of
2ln[p2/2] one can nd the following relation for one loop result of (1)

ef f =

(44)

(45)

the solution to eq.(45) is easy to nd and hence the solution for the

eective coupling depending on the physical energy scale is,

fn = ann+1, n  0,
ef f (p2, ; ) =


2aln p2

(46)

8moreover, according to this technique, the new ambiguities in the potentially divergent
multiloop graphs beyond the subgraph ambiguities must appear in the local part as ln 2
m2 .
thus upon collecting all the local parts together the nal expression for the local vertices
would look like  [1 + 1
i })]. that is the underlying structures
only renormalize the model constants [g] by a simple ln 2
m2 dependence on the masses
and an agent scale. this phenomnon (to be checked through detailed investigation in
the future) is closely related to the phenomenon of holomorphic dependence of chiral
quantities upon the chiral parameters in the supersymmetric qfts claimed by shifman
and vainshtein in the context of wilsonian renormalization [15].

which reproduces the uv asymptotic freedom due to the negative number a.
for qed this one loop approximation would lead to the well known landau
pole. note again the coupling constant here is the one given classically. as
for the rationality of this approximation, we should note that the framework
we are using to obtain this result is perturbative and the correctness of the
formulation in the underlying theory point of view is that all the eective
parameters should remain nite in comparision with the underlying structure
scale. when the system energy is too high, it is quite natural to see the
breakdwon of the present model of qed or other qfts. it is not appropriate
to interpret the landau pole as the signal of the triviality of qed. it is
also worthwhile to note that due to the dierence in the denitions of the
anomalies, there is multivaluedness in the eective couplings solved from the
conventional cse or rge with higher order corrections, while our new cse
is free from this defect.

5 decoupling theorem and underlying struc-

tures

now let us turn to the decoupling issue of the heavy particles in qfts.

as we have noted in last section, due to the logarithmic dependence of
the local constants (coi) upon the particle mass ( lnm2,see eq.(41)) these
constants would diverge as the particles become extremely heavy (m  )
and this in turn implies the nondecoupling of the heavy particles. while in
the subraction schemes eected at euclidean momentum, the heavy particles
contributions to the light sector vanish as the masses go to innity [4, 13].

to resolve this scheme dependence of decoupling phenomaon, we note
that from the underlying theory point of view, when a physical mass or mass
scale goes to innity relative to the characteristic energy scale of an eective
physical system, it means that the physics associated with this innite en-
ergy scale belongs to the uv underlying sectors of the eective system. or
the heavy particles now join the underlying structures party and the under-
lying constants {} are no longer innities for such heavy particles, then the
expressions containing ln 2
m2 that have arisen from the limit operation l{}
is no longer valid, or equivalently, the following operation is simply illegal if

20

one really accepts the underlying theory point of view,

limmln

2
m2 .

(47)

the correct procedure is now to expand the set of underlying constants {}
to include the extremely heavy particles masses and rewrite the whole qft
in terms of eective parameters of the light particles or elds. then the limit
operation l{} now changes to l{;(mheavy )} for the light objects and like other
underlying structures, these heavy particles inuences are delegated to the
agent constants that nally appear from the new limit operation l{;(mheavy )}.
since these agants are nite in principle, the eects of the heavy particles
only renormalize the light sectors by a nite amount in the local vertices.
in the sense of (47), it is also easy to see that the expressions obtained at
nite momenta for qfts can not be simply extrapolated to the uv limit as
it would again invalidate the limit operation about the underlying structures.
as the eetive parameters like mass and momenta become extremely
large, such elds would interact more directly with the underlying structures.
then the limit of decoupling the underlying structures for these heavy or high
ernergy elds are no longer valid and one has to work in models characterizing
more higher energy behaviors.

6 summary

from our discussions above, we can see that the underlying theory postulate
is quite natural and powerful. many dicult issues in conventional schemes
become easy to understand in this natural picture and the resolutions are
easy, at least in principle. the most signicant technical prediction from our
investigations here is the irrationality of certain conventional renormalization
schemes. we could also reproduce many novel results. the derivation of trace
anomaly in the underlying theory approach is a simple work.

as the scheme dependence in high energy applications of qcd is a very
important issue, we hope our investigations here could add new light to it. of
course our main goal here has been to demonstrate the plausibility and power
of our recent proposal for renormalization, the more technical applications of
the proposal have not been fully extended. we hope our strategy could lead
to more important contributions to high energy physics and beyond.

21

in summary, we derived several new versions of the ward-takahashi iden-
tities of scale transformations in any qft models as long as they are con-
sistent solely basing on the natural assumption that there are underlying
structures that can make the uv ends of the qfts well dened. of the sev-
eral equivalent versions, each has its own advantage and utility in dierent
situations. moreover, all our expressions are free from divergences and the
associated innite renormalization. all important conventional results can
be reproduced as long as they are physically consistent with the underlying
picture. a most important technical result is that the nite local part of any
potentially divergent vertex graph can not be arbitrary and therefore some
conventional subtraction schemes are, according to the underlying theory
point of view, unreasonable choices.
