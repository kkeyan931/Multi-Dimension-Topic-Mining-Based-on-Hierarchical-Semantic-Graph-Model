abstract

we consider the pure supersymmetric yangmills theories placed on a small
3-dimensional spatial torus with higher orthogonal and exceptional gauge groups.
the problem of constructing the quantum vacuum states is reduced to a pure math-
ematical problem of classifying the at connections on t 3. the latter problem is
equivalent to the problem of classication of commuting triples of elements in a
connected simply connected compact lie group which is solved in this paper. in
particular, we show that for higher orthogonal so(n ), n  7, and for all excep-
tional groups the moduli space of at connections involves several distinct connected
components. the total number of vacuum states is given in all cases by the dual
coxeter number of the group which agrees with the result obtained earlier with the
instanton technique.

introduction

it was shown by witten long time ago [1] that, in a pure n = 1 supersymmetric gauge
theory with any simple gauge group, the supersymmetry is not broken spontaneously.
placing the theory in a nite spatial box, the number of supersymmetric vacuum states
[the witten index tr(1)f ] was calculated to be tr(1)f = r + 1 where r is the rank of
the gauge group. this result conforms with other estimates for tr(1)f for unitary and
symplectic groups. for higher orthogonal and exceptional groups, it disagrees, however,
with the general result 1

tr(1)f = h ,

(1.1)

where h is the dual coxeter number of the group (see e.g. [3], chapt. 6; it coincides with
the casimir t at a in the adjoint representation when a proper normalization is chosen.).
for so(n  7), h = n  2 > r + 1. also for exceptional groups g2, f4, e6,7,8, the index
(1.1) is larger than wittens original estimate (see table 1).

1which follows e.g. from the counting of gluino zero modes on the instanton background and also from

the analysis of weakly coupled theories with additional matter supermultiplets [1, 2].

table 1: vacuum counting for exceptional groups.

this paradox persisting for more than 15 years has been recently resolved by witten
himself in the case of orthogonal groups [4]. he has found a aw in his original arguments
and shown that, for so(n  7), vacuum moduli space is richer than it was thought
before so that the total number of quantum vacua is n  2 in accordance with the result
(1.1).
in recent paper [5], this result was conrmed, and also the theory with the g2
gauge group was analyzed where an extra vacuum state has been found. the aim of our
paper is to develop a general method to construct the moduli space of at connections
for any gauge group including higher exceptional groups f4, e6,7,8. as was anticipated in
[5], the moduli space for these groups involves not one and not two, but many distinct
components (up to 12 components for e8). the total number of quantum vacuum states
coincides with h in all cases.

let us rst recall briey wittens original reasoning.

 put our theory on the spatial 3d torus and impose periodic boundary conditions
0 = 0. a classical vacuum is dened as
i (x, y, z) with zero eld strength (a at connection in

on the gauge elds 2. choose the gauge aa
a gauge eld conguration aa
mathematical language).

 for any at periodic connection, we can pick out a particular point in our torus
(0, 0, 0)  (l, 0, 0)  . . . and dene a set of holonomies (wilson loops along non
trivial cycles of the torus)

2 = p exp(iz l
3 = p exp(iz l

(1.2)

( ai = aa
are invariant under periodic gauge transformations.

i t a where t a are the group generators in a given representation). tr{i}

 a necessary condition for the periodic connection to be at is that all the holonomies
(1.2) commute [i, j] = 0. for a simply connected group with 1(g) = 1, it is also
a sucient condition.

2for unitary groups, one can perform the counting also with t hooft twisted boundary conditions,
but for the orthogonal and exceptional groups where the mismatch in the witten index calculations was
observed this method does not work.

2

 a sucient condition for the group matrices to commute is that their logarithms
belong to a cartan subalgebra of the corresponding lie algebra. for unitary and
simplectic groups, this happens to be also a necessary condition. in other words,
any set of commuting group matrices i with [i, j] = 0 can be presented in the
form

i = exp{ici},

[ci, cj] = 0 .

(1.3)

a at connection with the holonomies i is then just ai = ci/l. the moduli space
of all such connections presents ( up to factorization over the discrete weyl group)
the product tc  tc  tc where tc is the cartan torus whose dimension coincides
with the rank r of the group.

 the wittens original assumption which came out not to be true is that this is
also the case for all other groups. assuming this, witten constructed an eective
bornoppenheimer hamiltonian for the slow variables aa
i where the index a runs
it involves 3r bosonic degrees of freedom and
only over the cartan subalgebra.
their fermionic counterparts a
 is the weyl
spinor). imposing further the condition of the weyl symmetry (a remnant of the
original gauge symmetry) for the eigenstates of this hamiltonian, one nds r + 1
supersymmetric quantum vacuum states: 3

(cid:17)r

,

(1.4)

where ab = ab if an orthonormal basis in the cartan subalgebra is chosen.

however, for the groups spin(n) 4 and for all exceptional groups, there are some triples
of the group elements (1, 2, 3) which commute with each other but which cannot be
conjugated (gaugetransformed) to the maximal cartan torus. 5

in the case of spin(7), there is a unique [up to conjugation i  g1ig, g  spin(7)

] nontrivial triple. it can be chosen in the form [7, 4]

2

1 = exp(cid:26)
2 = exp(cid:26)
3 = exp(cid:26)

(12 + 34)(cid:27) = 1234 ,
(12 + 56)(cid:27) = 1256 ,
(13 + 57)(cid:27) = 1357 .

(1.5)

obviously, [i, j] = 0. on the other hand, as we will shortly be convinced, the triple
(1.5) cannot be conjugated to the maximal torus. this isolated triple corresponds to

3see appendix b for a rigorous proof.
4spin(n ) is the simply connected universal covering of so(n ).

it is represented by the matrices
exp{/2} where  are the gammamatrices of the corresponding dimension forming the cliord
algebra  +  = 2,  = 1, . . . , n . we have already mentioned and will see later that the
condition 1(g) = 0 is very important in the whole analysis. it what follows, we will discuss mostly the
groups spin(n ) rather than their orthogonal counterparts.

5this fact has actually been noticed by topologists long time ago. see e.g. refs.

[6, 7] where some

examples of such nontrivial triples were constructed.

thereby,

tr(1)f = rspin(7) + 1 + 1 = 5 = h

spin(7) .

(1.6)

for spin(8) and g2, there is also only one extra isolated triple and one extra vacuum
state. for spin(n  9), there is a family of such triples with each element lying on the
small torus which can be interpreted as the cartan torus of the centralizer 6 of the triple
(1.5). the continuous part of the latter is spin(n  7). this brings about rspin(n 7) + 1
extra vacuum states. the total counting is 7

tr(1)f = rspin(n ) + 1 + rspin(n 7) + 1 = n  2 = h

spin(n ) .

(1.7)

before proceeding further, let us make a simple remark. for a group which is not simply
connected, there are always nontrivial commuting pairs of the elements which cannot be
conjugated on the maximal torus. consider for example so(3). the elements diag(-1,
-1, 1) and diag(-1, 1, -1) obviously commute, but their logarithms proportional to the
generators of the correponding rotations  t3 and  t2 do not. in the covering su(2)
group, the corresponding elements i3 and i2 anticommute. such a pair of the elements
of su(2) is usually called the heisenberg pair. generally, we will call the heisenberg pair
a pair of the elements b, c which satisfy the relations

bc = zcb

(1.8)

where z is the element of the center of the group. an example of the heisenberg pair for
su(3) with z = e2i/3i is

b = 


0

1
0 e2i/3
0

0

0
0

e2i/3




, c = 


0 0 1
1 0 0
0 1 0

.




(1.9)

a permutation of b and c gives the pair with z = e2i/3i. as we will prove later,
all heisenberg pairs in su(3) are equivalent by conjugation to (1.9) or its permutation.
heisenberg pairs will play the central role in the whole analysis.

for a simply connected group, a pair of commuting elements g, h can always be con-
jugated to the maximal torus. that follows from the fact that one element can always
be put on the torus and from the so called botts theorem: the centralizer gg of any
element g in a connected simply connected compact lie group g is always connected. we

6the centralizer of the element g of the group g is dened as a subgroup of g involving all elements
h which commute with g. the centralizer of a triple is the subgroup of g commuting with each element
of the triple.

7in the case n = 9, there is a subtlety : the wittens index associated with the abelian spin(2) = u (1)
gauge group turns out to be zero, not ru(1) + 1 = 2. still, the counting (1.7) is correct due to the presence
of certain discrete factors in the centralizer [4, 5] which will be discussed in more details in appendix c.
moreover, we will show in appendix a that, for odd n , one can choose the triple in such a way that the
continuous part of its centralizer would be spin(n  6) rather than spin(n  7). for n = 9 that gives
rspin(3) + 1 = 2 extra vacuum states. also for n = 11, 13, . . . , the counting (1.7) holds due to the fact
that the ranks of spin(n  6) and spin(n  7) coincide for odd n .

rst put g on the torus of g and then conjugate h to the torus of the centralizer which
coincides with the large torus (obviously, once g is put on the torus, any element of the
torus belongs to the centralizer).

consider an arbitrary simply connected group g. for a commuting triple of elements
g1,2,3, the elements g2, g3 belong to the centralizer gg1 of g1. now if gg1 presents a product
of a simply connected group and some number of u(1) factors as is usually the case (e.g.
the centralizer of an element of su(3) can be su(3), su(2)  u(1) or [u(1)]2 ), one can
put g2 and g3 on the torus of gg1 and hence the whole triple on the torus of g. but if gg1
involves a factor whose fundamental group is nite, one cannot do it in a general case.

one can prove (we will do it later) that the centralizer of any element of a unitary or a
simplectic group is always simply connected up to some number of u(1) factors and hence
these groups do not admit nontrivial triples. a central statement is that it is not so for
higher orthogonal and exceptional groups. and this is the origin of nontrivial triples.

look again at the triple (1.5). the element 1 commutes with 6 generators i12/2 , . . .
of spin(4) acting on the subspace (1234) and with 3 generators of spin(3) acting on the
subspace (567). hence, the centralizer of 1 seems to be spin(4)  spin(3). this is not,
however, quite so: the whole product spin(4)  spin(3) is not a subgroup of spin(7). in-
deed, both spin(4) and spin(3) have nontrivial center. the center of spin(3)  su(2)
is z2, a nontrivial center element corresponding to rotation by 2 in, say, (56) - plane.
the center of spin(4)  su(2)su(2) is z2 z2. it has a diagonal element presenting
the product of nontrivial center elements in each su(2) factor:

z = exp(cid:26)

2

(12  34)(cid:27) exp(cid:26)

2

(12 + 34)(cid:27) = exp {12} .

(1.10)

note now that exp {12} = exp {56} = 1 in the full spin(7) group. hence the true
centralizer of 1 is [spin(4)  spin(3)]/z2  [su(2)]3/z2 where the factorization is done
over the common center of spin(3) and of each su(2) factor in spin(4). the matrices 2
and 3 correspond to the elements (i3, i3, i3) and (i2, i2, i2) in [su(2)]3, i.e. they
form a heisenberg pair in each su(2) factor. they still commute in the centralizer and in
spin(7) exactly because the factorization over the common center should be done. the
elements 2, 3 cannot be conjugated to the maximal torus in the centralizer and hence
the whole triple (1.5) cannot be conjugated to the maximal torus in spin(7).

what is the underlying reason for the fact that nontrivial triples exist in spin(7),
in higher spin(n) and in exceptional groups, but do not exist in unitary and simplectic
groups ? to understand it, one has to consider the dynkin diagram for the simple roots
of the corresponding algebras.

the several following paragraphs are addressed for the reader who is not an expert in
the compact lie group theory with a hope to give him a feeling what is going on here.
an expert can skip it and continue reading from the beginning of the next section.

the dynkin diagram for spin(7) is depicted in fig. 1 . , , and  are the simple
roots. the term root means that the corresponding generators t,, are eigenvectors
of the (complex) lie algebra of spin(7) with respect to its cartan subalgebra. in other
words, they satisfy the relations

[ei, t] = it,

[ei, t] = it,

[ei, t] = it ,

where ei is the normalized orthogonal basis in the cartan subalgebra. a convenient choice
is e1 = t12, e2 = t34, e3 = t56 where tij = iij/2 are the generators of spin(7). in that
case

t =

t = t57  it67 ,

(1.12)

[t,, multiplied by any factor would also satisfy the commutation relations (1.11), but
the normalization chosen in eq.(1.12) is the most convenient one]. the root vectors are
i = (1, 1, 0), i = (0, 1, 1) and i = (0, 0, 1). one can dene the scalar product h., .i
in a natural way. the squares of the lengths of the roots are equal to 2 for ,  and to
1 for . thereby,  is a short root and it is denoted with the small circle. a single
line between the roots ,  means that h, i = 1 so that the angle between these roots

, = arccoshh, i/qh, ih, ii = 120o. the double line between  and  means

that , = 135o. the absence of the line between  and  means that these roots are
orthogonal and the corresponding generators in the lie algebra commute. any other
positive 8 root of the algebra can be presented as a linear combination of the simple roots
a + a + a with positive integer a,,. the sum a + a + a is called the weight
of the root. the root with the highest weight  =  + 2 + 2 [the corresponding coroot
 is t12 + t34] plays a special role. it (or rather the corresponding negative root  )
is denoted by the dashed circle in fig. 1. the dynkin labels ai = (1, 2, 2) seen on the
diagram are just the coecients of the expansion of the highest root via the simple roots.

8for any such root , there is also a negative root . the commutator [t, t] lies in the cartan
subalgebra. in the following, we will need also the notion of coroot which is dened as the element 
of the cartan subalgebra proportional to [with the normalization choice as in eq.(1.12), just equal to]
[t, t] such that [, t] = 2t. in other words, the generators , t form the a1 [or su(2)]
subalgebra in the same way as the matrices 3,  do. for any coroot , the property exp{2i} = 1
holds. the ratio of the lengths of some coroots ,  is always inverse compared to the ratio of the
lengths of the corresponding roots ,  (so that a short root corresponds to a long coroot and the
other way round). for the spin(7) group, the coroots corresponding to the simple roots () are
 = t12  t34,  = t34  t56,  = 2t56.

6

it is convenient to ascribe the label 1 for the negative highest root. we see that  has
length 2, is orthogonal to  and , and form the angle 120o with the root .

we will prove later that whenever the algebra involve a simple root with the property
a
i = aihi, ii/2 > 1, an element of the group exist whose centralizer, with its u(1)
factors being stripped o, (that is called the semi-simple part of the centralizer) is not
simply connected. and if not, then not. that is why such exceptional elements are absent
for unitary and simplectic groups where a

i = 1 for all simple roots.

 = 2. thereby, the root  provides us with the
element whose centralizer is simply connected (no u(1) factors here and the centralizer
coincides with its semisimple part). the explicit form of this element is

 = 1 and a

for spin(7), a

 = a

 = exp{i} ,

(1.13)

where  is the fundamental coweight  the element of the cartan algebra satisfying
[, t] = t. indeed, in our case,  =  and 
the property [, t] = [, t] = 0,
coincides with 1 in eq. (1.5). the centralizer of  has been constructed explicitly above,
but it can also be calculated on the basis of the dynkin diagram. obviously,  commutes
with the generators corresponding to the simple roots , . but it also commutes with
the generator t corresponding to the highest root . that follows from the fact that
[, t] = 2t. thereby, the centralizer of  is formed by the commuting generators
t, t, t and is hence [su(2)]3. the fact that this product has to be factorized over the
common center z2 is not seen right away now, but we have seen it explicitly for spin(7)
and it will be proven in a general manner in the next section.

consider now higher groups spin(n  9). as is seen from table 2, the corresponding
dynkin diagrams involve several nodes with a
i = 2. each element j = exp{ij} has a
centralizer which is semi-simple and is not simply connected. moreover, in this case we
have a family of the elements

~s = exp
2ixj


sjj


(1.14)

where si are some real numbers with 2pi si = 1 and the sum runs over all the nodes

with a
i = 2. if all si are nonzero, the element (1.14) commutes with two (for odd n)
and three (for even n) simple roots with a
i = 1 and with the highest root . in this
general case, the centralizer of the element (1.14) is [su(2)]3/z2 [u(1)]r3 for n = 2r +1
and [su(2)]4/z2  [u(1)]r4 for n = 2r. the family (1.14) spans a ddimensional torus
in spin(n) (d = r  3 or r  4 depending on whether n is odd or even. it coincides
with the cartan torus of a subgroup spin(n  7) (or spin(n  6) for odd n) as is not
dicult to see when substituting the explicit expressions for the fundamental weights:
1 = i(12 + 34)/2, 2 = i(12 + 34 + 56)/2, etc.

we will see later that one can restrict all si in eq. (1.14) to be positive and the elements
(1.14) involving some negative si can be reduced by conjugation to the same canonical
form (1.14) with all si positive. thereby, the moduli space of exceptional elements (the
space of exceptional gauge orbits) presents the torus t d = [u(1)]d factorized over the
action of a certain discrete group which plays the role of the weyl group for this small
torus. for each such element (including also the case when some of si vanish), the moduli

space of nonequivalent heisenberg pairs in the centralizer presents a subset of t d  t d (
or rather its quotient by a nite group). thereby, the moduli space of all nonequivalent
triples lies in t d  t d  t d in agreement with the previous results.

i > 1. for example, g2 involves only one such node with a

as is seen from the table 2, the exceptional groups also involve a number of nodes
with a
i = 2 which gives rise to
only one nontrivial isolated triple. other exceptional groups involve several such nodes,
and the moduli space is somewhat more complicated but, as we will see, it can be rather
easily constructed just by the form of the corresponding dynkin diagram.

the three following sections present the hard core of the paper. in the next section,
after some preliminary remarks, we establish the families of the exceptional elements
whose centralizer is not simply connected. the structure of the heisenberg pairs in these
centralizers is the subject of sect. 3. in sect. 4 we construct the moduli space of all
commuting triples. in sect. 5, we spell out the results for higher exceptional groups in
a more explicit form.
in appendix a, we calculate the centralizers of the heisenberg
pairs and of nontrivial commuting triples for all gauge groups. in appendix b, we give
a rigourous proof that each distinct component in the moduli space of triples associated
with the torus t d  t d  t d gives exactly d + 1 vacuum states. appendix c is devoted to
calculation of one particular object  the group m which is dened as the intersection of
the relevant cartan subtorus with its centralizer (this group aects the global structure
of the thriples moduli space). we also take the opportunity there to write down some
further explicit illustrative formulae.

be the set of coroots. denote by q(g) and q(g) the zspan of the sets  and  ,
respectively. these are called the root and coroot lattices and actually depend only on
lie g. introduce the coweight lattice

p (g) = {h  h|e2ih = 1} .

this lattice contains the lattice q(g). it is well known that if g is a connected compact
lie group, then its fundamental group is given by the following formula

1(g) = p (g)/q(g) .

called simply laced (or 1laced), g of type bcf is called 2laced and the group g2 is
3laced. if j is a long root, one has: a
j = aj (that happens for all j in the a  d  e

vectors {0, 1, . . . , r} along with the integers aj are depicted by the extended dynkin

from d(g) by removing 0th node.

(a) any element of g can be conjugated to a unique element ~s.

in this form for nite order
elements it can be found e.g. in ref.[3], chapter 8. the connectedness of the centralizer
of any element of g is usually attributed to bott (see e.g. [7], 3). a proof of the second
part of b) can also be found in [3], chapter 8.

finally, the proof of c) is based on the formula (2.2). if g is a subgroup of g containing

t , then p ( g) = p (g) = q(g) and q( g)  q(g), hence

1( g) = q(g)/q( g)

(2.8)

note that by b), q(g~s) is spanned over z by those 
the proof of c) now is completed by the following simple lemma.

j for which sj = 0 (j = 0, . . . , r).

lemma 1. let q = r

i=1 aii
be a non-zero element of q. let i be a subset of {0, 1, . . . , r} and let qi = iizi.
then the group q/qi is isomorphic to a direct product of zr#i and a cyclic group of
order gcd{ai|i / i}.

i=1zi be a free abelian group of rank r and let 0 = pr

proof. if 0 / i, the lemma is obvious.

if 0  i, we may choose a basis of qi of
the form 0, i1, i2, . . . where i1, i2, . . .  1. after reordering of the set {1, . . . , r}, the
matrix expressing this basis in terms of the basis of q takes the form

m =  

a1 . . . as

as+1 . . . ar

diag(1, . . . , 1)

0

!

(2.9)

it follows that all elementary divisors of m are a := gcd{as+1, . . . ar}, 1, . . . , 1. hence the
maximal nite subgroup of q/qi is a cyclic group of order a.

remark 1. recall that the element g  g is called nonadexceptional [8] if it can
be written in the form g = e2i, where (ad g)x = x, i [, x] = 0 (, x  i lie g).
it was shown in ref.[8] that g is nonadexceptional i the set of integers ai for which
the coordinates si of g are nonzero are relatively prime. it follows from our theorem
1c that, for a nonadexceptional g, 1(gg) is a free abelian group (or, equivalently, the
semi-simple part of gg is simply connected) and that for a simply laced g the converse
holds as well.

figure 2: coroot lattices for g = g2 and its subgroup g = [su(2)]2/z2. blank circles
mark out the nodes of q(g) not belonging to q( g).

fig. 2 provides an illustration for the theorem 1 in the simplest nontrivial case of
g2. the lattice q(g = g2) is formed by the coroots  and  and the lattice q( g)
for the centralizer is formed by the (orthogonal) coroots  and 
0 = 2 + . we see
that q(g) involves, indeed, extra nodes compared to q( g) (the blank circles in fig.
2 ) and that q(g)/q( g)  1( g) = z2. (in this simple case, 1( g) does not involve
extra z factors associated with the u(1) factors in the centralizer.)

3 heisenberg pairs in compact lie groups.

given a central element z in a compact lie group g, a heisenberg pair with center z is a
pair of elements b, c  g satisfying the commutation relation (1.8). if in addition z has
order m, and one has

bm = cm = ( 1

zm/2

if m is odd

if m is even

(3.1)

then (b, c) is called a standard heisenberg pair with center z. a heisenberg pair (b, c) is
called lowest dimensional if its orbit g  (b, c) under conjugation has minimal dimension
(among heisenberg pairs with center z).

example 1. let (b, c) be an irreducible heisenberg pair in u(n) (i.e.

there are
no nontrivial subspace invariant with respect to b and c ). then z = in where  is a
primitive m-th root of 1. let v1 be an eigenvector for b: bv1 = v1, and let vj+1 = cj+1v1,
j = 1, . . . , n  1. since the pair (b, c) is irreducible, the vectors vj , j = 1, . . . , n form a
basis of cn . due to (1.8), we have

bvj = j1vj,

j = 1, . . . , n .

(3.2)

12

since, due to (1.8), c permutes cyclically the eigenspaces of b, it follows from irreducibility
of the pair (b, c) that all eigenspaces of b are 1 - dimensional. hence, we have

cvj = vj+1,
cvn = v1 .

j = 1, . . . , n  1

since cn v1 is a multiple of v1, we get by (1.8) that n = 1. therefore

n = m .

(3.3)

(3.4)

thus, all irreducible heisenberg pairs (b, c) in u(n) with center z = in , where  is a
primitive m-th root of 1, are given up to conjugation by (3.2)  (3.4), where  and  are
arbitrary constants of modulus 1.

if (b, c) is a standard irreducible heisenberg pair in u(m) with center i,  being a

primitive m-th root of 1, then clearly

m =  = (1)m+1 .

(3.5)

it follows that there exists a unique up to conjugation such pair and it lies in su(m).
[for m = 2, the matrices (3.2), (3.3) with the condition (3.5) are reduced to i3, i2
and, for m = 3,  = e2i/3, they coincide with (1.9).]

due to complete reducibility, we obtain that there exists in u(n) a heisenberg pair
with center z = in ,  being a primitive m-th root of 1, i m divides n and that any
such pair is conjugate to a direct sum of n/m such irreducible pairs. moreover, in this
case there exists a unique up to conjugation standard heisenberg pair, say (b, c), which
is a direct sum of irreducible such pairs, and any heisenberg pair in u(n) or su(n) can
be conjugated to a pair obtained by multiplying (b, c) by a direct sum of matrices iim,
i = 1, . . . , n/m, where |i| = 1 and, in the su(n) case, qi m

note that the centralizer of the standard heisenberg pair (b, c) is isomorphic to the
direct product of hzi and su(n/m) (here and further hzi denotes the cyclic group gen-
erated by z). it is also clear that this is a lowest dimensional heisenberg pair with center
in , where  is a primitive m-th root of 1.

i = 1.

proposition 1. let g be as in theorem 1, let z be a central element of g and let
(b, c) be a heisenberg pair with center z. let t 0 be a maximal torus in the centralizer of
this pair in g. then any heisenberg pair with center z can be conjugated to a heisenberg
pair of the form (bt, ct), where t, t  t 0, and the rank of its centralizer always equals
dim t 0. two pairs from p := bt 0  ct 0 can be conjugated to each other i they can be
conjugated by an element from the normalizer of p in g.

proof. consider the group gb,hzi = {x  g|x1bx  bhzi}. its connected components
are zgb, where z  hzi. the connected component containing c is zgb; it consists of
all c such that (b, c) is a heisenberg pair with center z. the element c acts on gb,hzi by
conjugation preserving the component zgb. recall that, by gantmachers theorem [9], (i)
all conjugacy classes in a compact lie group k contained in a connected component of
its element g intersect the set gt 0, where t 0 is a maximal torus in the centralizer of g in
k, (ii) up to conjugacy, t 0 depends only on the connected component, (iii) two elements
from gt 0 can be conjugated by an element of k i they can be conjugated by an element

from the normalizer of gt 0 in k. hence, by the rst part of gantmachers theorem, all
conjugacy classes of the group gb,hzi contained in zgb intersect the set ct 0.

let (b, c) be a heisenberg pair with center z. by above, we may assume that c =
ct, t  t 0. but b  gct,hzi, and arguing as above we see that b can be conjugated in the
group gct,hzi by the conjugation action of gct into the set bt 0. the fact that the rank
of the centralizer of (b, c) equals dim t 0 follows from the second part of gantmachers
theorem. the last part of the proposition follows from the last part of gantmachers
theorem.

now we will construct standard heisenberg pairs (bm, cm) in the universal covers of
semi-simple parts of centralizers of exceptional elements. this will provide us with a
collection of commuting pairs (bm, cm) in the centralizers themselves.

m is the intersection of tm with the fundamental alcove [consisting of the

m = rm , where rm is the number of nodes of dm minus 1.

it is clear that the centralizer of t 

m in g is tmlm, where lm is a semi-simple subgroup.
due to theorem 1b,c, lm is a connected semi-simple compact lie group with dynkin
diagram dm and its fundamental group is a cyclic group of order m. let lm be the
universal cover of lm, so that lm = lm/zm, where zm  lm is a cyclic group of order
m. let z(1)
m i = zm. note that um is
the number of positive integers  m relatively prime to m. a look at table 2 gives the

where m is a gexceptional integer and i = 1, . . . , um. note that each t (i)
component in the set of all commuting triples in g. since dim f (i)
the centralizer in g of a generic triple of f (i)

m is a torus of dimension rm, we have

m is a connected
m = 3rm (r1 = r) and

dim t (i)

m = dim g + 2rm .

(4.3)

triples from it (i)

m are called mexceptional.

theorem 3. let g be the same as in theorem 1.
(a) the set t of commuting triples in g is a disjoint union of the subsets t (i)

m , where

m runs over all gexceptional integers and i = 1, . . . , um.
m is rm.

(b) rank of the centralizer of a triple from t (i)
(c) the sum over all components of t of the numbers rm + 1 is equal to h.
proof. let (a, b, c) be a triple of commuting elements in g. if a is not exceptional,
then by theorem 1c, 1(ga) is a free abelian group, hence ga is a direct product of a
torus t1  t and the semi-simple part which is a connected simply connected group. but
then the commuting pair (b, c)  ga can be conjugated to t in ga (since the centralizer
of b in ga is connected, the element c can be conjugated in ga  gb to t ). thus, in this
case (a, b, c) is a trivial triple (i.e. it can be conjugated to t ).

let now a be mexceptional for m  2. we may assume that a  t alc

m (see theorem
1a). then the group ga is a product of one of the groups qm (see theorem 2) and a torus,
say t1. let ga = t1  qm so that ga = ga/zm and let b, c denote some preimages of
(b, c)  ga in ga. if bc = cb, then the pair (b, c) can be conjugated in ga to the preimage
of t and the triple (a, b, c) is trivial. finally, if bc = zcb for a nontrivial element z = z(i)
d

the values of rm and um for m > 1 are listed in table 4. the group wm in this table
is the weyl group of the torus tm, i.e. the group of linear transformations of ilie tm
generated by conjugations of g which leave tm invariant ( t1 is just a maximal torus and
w1 is the weyl group w of g). we will exploit it in the following section and in the
appendix b where the calculation of wm for m > 1 is also explained (see remark b2).
the group cm is the semi-simple part of the centralizer of tm in g. it will be discussed
and calculated below where we will give an explicit construction of the moduli space for
the commuting triples. the same refers to the nite group m in the last column of table
4.

remark 2. recall that, due to theorem 1c, an element g of g can be conjugated
m i the order of the maximal nite subgroup of 1(gg) is divisible by m. pick an
m . then the centralizer of any generic element g  amtm is tmlm, and
m can

therefore g can be conjugated to t alc
be conjugated (by w ) to t alc

we proceed now to explicitly describe the moduli space m(i)

m by an action of a nite group.

m of triples from t (i)

m as a

a triple from t is called isolated if its centralizer is nite. it follows from theorem 3

that the following are equivalent conditions for a triple to be isolated:

 rm = 0

 t (i)

m is a single gorbit.

it is easy to see that the centralizer of an isolated triple (a, b, c) is a product of three cyclic
groups of order m (generated by a, b and c). a look at table 4 provides a complete list
of isolated triples given by table 5dvips triples (for each g and m there are um of them):

consider the centralizer c 

m.
due to corollary 1, cm is a connected simply connected semisimple subgroup of g. note
that cm  lm, hence rank(cm)  r  rm , but since tm commutes with cm, we get also
the reverse equality. hence

m of tm and let cm denotes the semisimple part of c 

rank (cm) = r  rm

(4.8)

m = cmtm. it is clear that e(i)

and c 
m (cm cm cm)
is not empty. in other words, cm contains an mexceptional triple, say (a, b, c). this triple
is isolated in cm, since in the contrary case the rank of its centralizer in g would be greater
than rm, in contradiction with theorem 3b.

thus cm is a semi-simple subgroup of g containing an isolated mexceptional triple ,
and its dynkin diagram is a subdiagram of d(g) which consists of r  rm nodes. a look
at table 5 establishes that the only possibilities for cm are those listed in table 4.

remark 3. we have obtained a slightly more canonical construction of the sets
m , i = 1, . . . , um. let k1, . . . , kum be all integers between 1 and m relatively prime to

e(i)
m. pick an isolated triple (am, bm, cm) in the subgroup cm. then

e(i)

m = amtm  bmtm  cki

mtm

(4.9)

denote by nm the normalizer of the set e(i)

m in g (clearly, it is independent of i),
m in g is tm. let

m o. note that the centralizer of e(i)

i.e. nm = ng  g|ge(i)

m g1  e(i)

17

rm = nm/tm; then the moduli space m(i)

m of triples from t (i)

m is the quotient

m(i)

m = e(i)

m /rm ,

where rm is a nite group that we are about to compute. this follows from the last part of
proposition 1. for example, in the case of trivial triples one has: m(1)
1 = (t t t )/w
(with the diagonal action of w ).

let n(tm) = {g  g|gtmg1  tm}. recall that wm = n(tm)/(cmtm) is the weyl

group of tm. one, clearly, has

nm = ng  n(tm)|gamg1  amtm, gbmg1  bmtm, gcmg1  cmtmo .

(4.10)

since there always exists a triple in e(i)
wm (cf. table 7), we obtain:

m for which the weyl group of the centralizer is

rm = wmam ,

where wm normalizes am and

am =

{g  cm|g(am, bm, cm)g1 = (amt1, bmt2, cmt3) for some t1, t2, t3  tm}

{centralizer of (am, bm, cm) in cm}

(4.11)

.(4.12)

but t1, t2, t3 lie also in cm, hence they are central in cm. note that multiplying each
element of the triple (am, bm, cm) by a central element of cm again gives an isolated triple
of cm. hence we have:

am = m  m  m ,

(4.13)

where m = center(cm)  tm. we thus have proven the following theorem:

theorem 4. the connected component m(i)

m of the moduli space of mexceptional

triples in g looks as follows:

m(i)

m =   amtm

m



bmtm
m



cki
mtm

m !, wm

(4.14)

here (am, bm, cm) is an isolated mexceptional triple in cm, ki are all integers between 1
and m relatively prime to m, m = center(cm)  tm acting by multiplication, and wm
is the weyl group of tm acting diagonally. the groups wm are listed in the corresponding
column of table 4. (they happen to coincide with the weyl group of the centralizer of a
lowest-dimensional mexceptional triple; see remark b2 and corollary b2.)

the only remaining question is what are the groups m. we have resolved it by explicit
calculations described in appendix c. the results are given in the last column of table
4. it turns out that in almost all cases m coincides with the center of cm. the only
exception are the groups spin(2r), r > 4; the center of c2 = spin(8) in this case is
z2  z2, but the group 2 is just z2.

remark 4. let g be as in theorem 1 and let  be a diagram automorphism of g of
order k = 2 (for types a, d, e6) or 3 (for type d4). let g be a connected component of
the semidirect product of hi and g, containing . then theorems 1-4 hold if instead of
g one takes g and instead of the extended dynkin diagram (denoted by x (1)
in [3]), one
takes the twisted diagrams x (k)
r
the dual coxeter number of x (k)
r which is equal to the coxeter number of the group g.

5 counting quantum vacua. examples.

consider a connected component m(i)
m in the moduli space of all commuting triples. as
we have seen, it presents a subset of the product of three (shifted) tori t rm of dimension
rm (or rather a quotient of this product by action of a nite group), where r1 is the rank
of the group and rm for all nontrivial components for all groups are listed in table 4. in
the full analogy with (1.4), m(i)

m gives rise to rm + 1 quantum vacuum states

where i mark the cartan generators forming an orthonormal basis on the small torus t rm
qiqi is the quadratic invariant of the weyl group wm of t rm (see table 4, last
column). 9 note that the powers higher than rm in eq. (5.1) would give just zero due
to anticommuting nature of i
. the appendix b is devoted to the proof of the fact that
all linear independent elements of the grassmann algebra with the base i
,  = 1, 2,
invariant under the action of the weyl group are reduced to the powers of quadratic
invariant which means that all quantum vacuum states associated with the component
mk are, indeed, listed in eq.(5.1). we have all together

tr(1)f = xk

(rm + 1)k

(5.2)

where the sum runs over all components mk. 10 from table 4, we have (1+1)1+(0+1)
2 = 4 extra states (associated with the components with m > 1) for f4, 31+12 = 5 extra
states for e6, 41+22+12 = 10 extra states for e7, and 51+32+22+14+12 = 21
extra states for e8. as is seen from table 1, adding these states to rg + 1 gives exactly
h in all cases.

the components with m > 1 coincides with the sum pj(a

this latter fact has been established by theorem 3c. another way to understand it
is the following. we have seen that the extra components mk are associated with the
nodes with a
i > 1 on the dynkin diagrams. just by construction, the sum (5.2) over
j  1) over all such nodes.
consider, e.g. the node 6 with a
6 = 6 on the dynkin diagram for e8. it gives rise to
two dierent isolated triples with m = 6 (and, correspondingly, to two dierent quantum
states). together with two nodes with a
i = 3, it gives rize to the component mk based on
the torus t rm=2 ( and if the node 6 were not present in the superposition, the dimension
of the torus would be one unit less, and we would have not 3, but just 2 vacuum states ).
finally, together with the nodes with a
j = 2, 4, it forms the torus t 4. as we have here
m = 3, there are two dierent components mk involving such torus and, correspondingly,
two extra vacuum states brought about by the node 6. all together, this node gives rise
to 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 = a

6  1 extra states. the same counting works for all other nodes.

9choosing a particular embedding t rm  g amounts to xing a particular gauge. after that, one
should still require the invariance with the respect to a discrete group of weyl transformations which is
a remnant of the original gauge group after the embedding is xed. the relevant groups wm are listed
in table 4.

10the wave functions in eq.(5.1) depend only on the elements of the algebra and do not know about
the global structure of the triples moduli space studied carefully in the previous section. therefore, this
structure does not aect the counting (5.2).

at the end, we list again our results for higher exceptional groups. further explicit

formulae can be found in appendix c.

 f4.

i) there is a root 3 with a

3 = 3. according to theorem 1, there is only
one associated element g = exp{(2i/3) 3}. the centralizer of this element is
su(3)su(3) (the dynkin diagram for the centralizer is obtained from the extended
dynkin diagram of f4 by removing the node 3) factorized over the common center
z3. 11 z3 has two nontrivial elements and, correspondingly, there are two dierent
nontrivial heisenberg pairs in su(3) : the pair in eq. (1.9) and its permutation.
we have proven earlier [see the remark after eq.(3.5)] that all other heisenberg
pairs can be reduced to (1.9) by conjugation. from this, we have two dierent
isolated triples {i} and two dierent corresponding quantum vacuum states. note
that, in this case, the second triple is obtained from the rst one just by reordering
2  3, but they are still two dierent triples from our viewpoint. they describe
two dierent at connections on t 3 which cannot reduced one to another by gauge
transformation.
ii) there are two nodes (the long root 2 and the short root 4) with a
i = 2. the
centralizer of g = exp{2i(s22 +s44)}, 2s2 +4s4 = 1, is nontrivial. if s2, s4 6= 0,
it is [su(2)]3/z2  u(1). correspondingly, there is a family t 1  t 1  t 1 [up to
a factorization over a certain discrete group  see eq.(4.14) and also appendix
c for more details ] of nontrivial commuting triples which gives rise to two extra
quantum vacua.

 e6. i) the element exp{(2i/3) 3} associated with the node with ai = 3 12 has a
centralizer [su(3)]3/z3. it gives two dierent isolated triples and two corresponding
vacua.
ii) three nodes with ai = 2 produce a family  t 2  t 2  t 2 of nontrivial com-
muting triples. there are 3 quantum vacuum states associated with that.

 e7. i) the centralizer of the element exp{i/2 4} associated with the node with
ai = 4 is g4 = g4/z4 where g4 = [su(4)]2  su(2) and the factorization over z4
implies the following identication of the elements of the center of g4:

1  (ii4, ii4, i2)  (i4, i4, i2) .

(5.3)

the elements (ii4, ii4, i2) are of the fourth order. for each such element, there
is unique up to conjugation heisenberg pair is g4: (b(4)
 , i2)
, where (b(4)
 ) are the standard heisenberg pairs with center i4 in su(4). the
corresponding elements in the centralizer commute. thereby, we have two dierent
isolated triples and two new vacua.

 , i3) and (c(4)

 , c(4)

 , b(4)

 , c(4)

11note that the element g = g2 has also this property, but it gives nothing new because it is equivalent

to g by conjugation. this is guaranteed by theorem 1a.

12all the roots for the groups e6,7,8 are long and there is no distinction between ai and a
i .

20

ii) the centralizer g4 admits also heisenberg pairs based on the 2order element of
z4. a standard heisenberg pair in g4 associated with that has the form (b(2), b(2), 1);
(c(2), c(2), 1), where (b(2), c(2)) is the standard heisenberg pair with center i4 in
su(4). the centralizer of the triple formed by a canonical exceptional element
exp{i/2 4} and the commuting elements in g4 corresponding to this heisen-
berg pair is [su(2)]3 where rst two su(2) factors are the centralizers of the pair
(b(2), c(2)) in each su(4) and the third one is the whole su(2) factor in g4. the
3 + 3  parametric family of triples following from that is actually a subset of a
larger family lying in t 3  t 3  t 3 which is based on a generic exceptional element
formed by the node 4 together with three other nodes with ai = 2. the centralizer
of a generic such element is [su(2)]4/z2  [u(1)]3 and the centralizer of a generic
such triple is [u(1)]3. from this, we obtain 4 extra quantum vacua.

iii) there is a one-parametric family of exceptional elements associated with the
nodes with ai = 3. the centralizer of a generic such element is [su(3)]3/z3  u(1).
correspondingly, there are two dierent components  t 1  t 1  t 1 in the moduli
space of the triples m, each of them giving 2 extra vacua.

 e8.

i) the element exp{i/3 6} associated with the node with ai = 6 has the
centralizer g6 = g6/z6 where g6 = su(6)  su(3)  su(2) and the factorization
over z6 implies

1  (ei/3i6, e2i/3i3, i2)  (e2i/3i6, e4i/3i3, i2)    

(5.4)

the center of g6 has two elements of the 6-th order which are identied to 1 after
factorization. they give rise to two dierent heisenberg pairs in g6 which corre-
spond to commuting elements in g6. we have two isolated triples and two extra
vacua. besides, z6 has 2 elements of order 3 and an element of order 2. as was
also the case for e7, heisenberg pairs associated with that are absorbed in the
families iii) and iv) below, formed by a combination of several nodes.

ii) the element exp{2i/5 5} associated with the node with ai = 5 has the cen-
tralizer [su(5)]2/z5. there are four dierent heisenberg pairs in su(5) with the
property bc = cb, bc = 2cb, bc = 3cb and bc = 4cb,  = exp{2i/5}. correspond-
ingly: 4 isolated triples and 4 extra vacua.
iii) there are two distinct components  t 1t 1t 1 associated with a 1parametric
mixture of the 4exceptional elements exp{i/2 4} and exp{i/2 4} associated
with two dierent nodes with ai = 4. each such component gives 2 vacua.
iv) there are two distinct components  t 2  t 2  t 2 formed by the nodes 6 and
two nodes 3, each of them giving 3 vacua.
v) the component lying in t 4  t 4  t 4 formed by the nodes 6, two nodes 4 and
two nodes 2 gives 5 extra vacua.

note. a few days before we sent the rst version of this paper to the archive, another
paper on this subject appeared [10] where an explicit construction of the set of nontrivial
triples with m = 2 for all exceptional groups has been done. it was followed by the paper

21

[11] where the structure of triples with m = 3, 4, 5, 6 was analyzed. the results agree
with ours. the question of completeness of this classication was not studied, however,
in these papers. the theorems proven here guarantee that, indeed, all nontrivial triples
lie in one of the families discussed above and the total number of quantum states always
coincides, indeed, with the dual coxeter number of the group.

appendix a: heisenberg pairs in all connected simply
connected compact lie groups.

here is a general way to construct a heisenberg pair (b, c) with center z in a simply
connected simple compact lie group g (for semi-simple g we just take the product of the
(bi, ci) over all simple factors gi).

recall that all nontrivial central elements of g are of the form e2ij where j is such
that aj = 1. pick such a j and consider the set of roots {0, 1, . . . , r}\j. this is
another set of simple roots, hence there exists a unique element wj of the weyl group w
of g which transforms it to the set 1, . . . , r, hence wjj = 0. this gives us a canonical
embedding of the center of g in w : e2ij  wj, and, at the same time, in the group of
symmetries of the extended dynkin diagram d(g).

let z = e2ij be a central element of g of order m  2. consider the corresponding
element of the weyl group wj. and denote by hwji a let ihwj i = hwji  0 (the notation
hwji stands like before for the cyclic subgroup of w generated by the element wj) be the
subset of the set of nodes of d(g) obtained by the action of the group hwji on the node
0 (as = 1 for all nodes from ihwj i).

let

b = ~s

(a.1)

as in eq. (2.5), where ~s is dened by si = 1/m if i  ihwj i and si = 0 otherwise. write
wj = r1    rk as a shortest product of reections with respect to some (not necessarily
simple) roots 1, . . . , k and let

where qt is the pauli matrix i2 in the su(2) corresponding to the root t [or in other

c = q1    qk ,

(a.2)

words, qt = expn 

subalgebra h with the group element qt presents the reection with respect to the root
t:

(qt)1hqt = h 

2hh, 
t i
h
t , 
t i


t

(a.3)

thereby, eq.(a.2) presents a particular lifting of wj in g : for the elements of the maximal
torus, c1eihc = eiwjh, and the action of this conjugation can of course be also dened

for all other elements of g. the choice (a.2) is convenient, but one could take for c any
other such lifting.

theorem a1. let g be as in theorem 1 and let z = e2ij be a central element of

g of order m  2.

(a) the pair (b, c) given by (a.1) and (a.2) is a heisenberg pair with center z.
(b) any heisenberg pair with center z in g can be conjugated to a heisenberg pair of
the form (bt, ct), where (b, c) is given by (a.1) and (a.2) and t, t lie in a xed maximal
torus t 0 of the centralizer of (b, c). two pairs from p := (bt 0, ct 0) can be conjugated to
each other i they are conjugated by the normalizer of p.

(c) the centralizer of a lowest dimensional heisenberg pair of g with center z is the

direct product of hzi and a connected subgroup k listed in table 6.

proof. it is easy to see that (b, c) is a heisenberg pair with center z. indeed, c1bc =

eiwj , where  = (2/m)psihwj i\0 s and one can check that ei(wj ) = z, hence bc =

(b) follows from proposition 1. finally, the centralizer of b in g is obtained
zcb 13.
by removing all nodes j with aj = 1 from d(g). multiplying, if necessary, c by an
element from a maximal torus from the centralizer of (b, c), we may assume that c induces
a diagram automorphism of gb for which the xed point sets are wellknown (see [3],
chapter 8). this proves (c). 14

13let us illustrate how this general construction works in the simplest nontrivial case of g = su (3).
fundamental coweights are 1 = (21 + 2)/3 = (1/3)diag(2, 1, 1), 2 = (22 + 1)/3 =
(1/3)diag(1, 1, 2). we have exp{2i1} = 1 and exp{2i2} = 21 ( = exp{2i/3}). the corre-
sponding elements of the weyl group present the cyclic permutations of the eigenvalues of the diagonal
su (3) matrices: w1 : (231) and w2 : (312). in this case, hw1i = hw2i, ihwj i coincides with the whole
extended dynkin diagram, and b = exp{2i(1 + 2)/3} = diag(, 1, 2). pick up w1 = r2 r1 . eq.(a.2)

we have bc = cb and the pair (b, c) thus constructed is equivalent by conjugation to the pair (1.9).

14example: consider the group e7. the center of e7 is z2 and the extended dynkin diagram of e7 has
z2 mirror symmetry. the centralizer of b in e7 is e6. the centralizer of the pair (b, c) is a subgroup of

remark a1. theorem a1 gives a classication of all up to conjugacy commuting
pairs in connected compact (not necessarily simply connected) lie groups g. in particular,
this theorem shows that connected components of the set of pairs of commuting elements
of g are in one-to-one correspondence with elements of the maximal nite subgroup of
1(g).

using table 6, one immediately gets the list of centralizers of mexceptional triples
j and (b, c) is the lowest dimensional pair in

ga.

e6 invariant under the conjugation corresponding this mirror symmetry. the dynkin diagram for such a
subgroup is obtained from the dynkin diagram of e6 by gluing together two pairs of the (co)roots. this
is the dynkin diagram of f4 [the embedding f4  e6 thus constructed will be discussed in some more
details in appendix c: see eq.(c.10)]. that is how the result quoted in the last line of the last column of
table 6 is obtained, and all other cases can be treated in a similar way. to avoid confusion, note that, in
contrast to the centralizer of a single element, the centralizer of a heisenberg pair need not, and generally
is not a regular subgroup of g.

n = 2r + 1 : g(k)
n = 2r : g(k)

triple = spin(2k  1)  spin(2r  2k  3), k = 1, . . . , r  2

triple = spin(2k  1)  spin(2r  2k  5), k = 1, . . . , r  3 (a.4)

where k labels the nodes with a
i = 2 on the dynkin diagram of the corresponding
group. note that in the case of even n the maximal centralizer is g(1)
triple =
spin(n  7) as was noticed before in [4, 5]. however, for n = 2r + 1, the maximal
centralizer is spin(n 6). an example of the corresponding nontrivial triple for spin(9)
is (1234, 125, 136). it can be embedded in p in(6), but not in spin(6).

triple = g(r3)

for all exceptional groups these centralizers are listed in table 7. the groups e7,8
involve also the nodes with not prime a
j = aj. these nodes admit triples with m <
a
j , m|a
j . as was explained in some details in sect. 5, the centralizer of the 2exceptional
triple in e7 associated with the node 4 is [su(2)]3. the calculations for e8 are done in a
similar way and the results are listed in table 8. note that the centralizers of the triples
with a given m associated with dierent nodes might be dierent, but their rank is always
the same as it of course should be in virtue of proposition 1.

appendix b: grassmann invariants of weyl groups.

let v = i lie t be the euclidean rdimensional vector space on which the weyl group
w acts via the reection representation. we shall assume in this section that the group
g is (almost) simple, hence the representation of w in v is irreducible. the group w
acts diagonally on v  v and this action induces an action on the grassmann algebra

 = (v  v ) .

proof. it is a simple and wellknown fact that, for any representation of a nite group
 in a nitedimensional vector space u, the dimension of the space of invariants of  in

25

the grassmann algebra (u) over u is given by the formula

dim (u) =

1

# xg

det(1 + g) .

(b.1)

applying this to  = w , u = v  v , we see that theorem b1 is equivalent to the
following formula:

[pw(1)]2 = (r + 1) #w ,

(b.2)

xww

where pw(x) stands for the characteristic polynomial det(x  w) of w acting on v . for-
tunately, there is in ref. [12] a complete table of characteristic polynomials for all weyl
groups which allows one to check (b.2) in all cases.

e. vinberg pointed out that a conceptial proof of this theorem has been given by l.
solomon [13] long ago: note that dim w = dim endw [(v )]. but all j(v ), j =
0, . . . , r, are irreducible and inequivalent representations of w . hence the righthand
side of the last equality equals r + 1.

remark b1. in fact, one has a renement of (b.1):

dim j(u)xj =

xj0

1

# xg

det(x + g) .

(b.3)

hence, theorem b1 is equivalent to a renement of (b.2):

1 + x2 + x4 + . . . + x2r =

1

#w xww

[det(x + g)]2 .

(b.4)

therefore, letting x = 1, we have:

r + 1 =

1

#w xww

det(1  w)2 .

(b.5)

the number det(1  w) is called the defect of w. the defect of the coxeter elements is
equal to # center(g). it follows from (b.5) that in the an case ( and only in this case)
all other elements have defect 0 (cf. [12]).

corollary b1. the dimension of the space of the invariants of the group wm on the

grassmann algebra over i lie tm  i lie tm is rm + 1.

proof. in order to apply theorem b1, we need to show that wm contains an irre-
ducible nite reection group. to show this, remark that if tm is a maximal torus of a
compact subgroup, say k, of g, then wm contains the weyl group of k. from the list
of groups given in table 7, we conclude that wm contains the subgroup listed in the wm
column of table 4.

remark b2. it is not dicult to show that the group listed in the wm column of

table 4 (denote this group by w 

m) coincides with wm. indeed, we have:

w 

m  wm  w  gl (i lie tm) ,

figure 3: dynkin diagrams for spin(2r + 1).

and one can check that in all cases the rst group coincides with the last. in the most
dicult e8 case, for m = 2 (resp. 3), this follows from the fact that wf4 (resp. wg2 ) is
a maximal nite subgroup of gl(m, z). this argument works in all cases except for two:
i) g = spin(15) or spin(16) with wm = wb4 which can in principle be embedded in wf4
and ii) g = e6, m = 2 with wm = wa2  wg2. however, the explicit calculations of
appendix c show that in all cases #wm = #w 
m. together with eq.(b.6), that means
that wm and w 

m coinside.

corollary b2. if wm = wxr in table 4, then the centralizer of a lowest-dimensional

m-exceptional triple in g is a compact lie group of type xr.

appendix c: tori, fundamental alcoves and triples
moduli space.

we present here some explicit formulae for the fundamental weights j entering the deni-
tion of the alcoves (2.4), (2.5), study the corresponding tori (3.6) and nd the intersections
m of tm with the semi-simple parts of their centralizers cm. we do it both by illustrative
purposes and also because we need the groups m to construct explicitly the moduli space
(4.14) of the commuting triples.

we will not discuss here the groups g2, spin(7), spin(8) where the 2exceptional

triples are isolated. that was done in enough details in the main text.

i) spin(2r+1), r > 3. the dynkin diagram is drawn anew in fig. 3. the fundamental
alcove (2.4), (2.5) involves the weights 1, . . . , r2 which can be conveniently written
in this case in the orthonormal basis ej = i2j12j/2 :

1 = e1 + e2 = 
. . .

r2 = e1 + e2 + . . . + er1

(c.1)

a general expression (2.5) for the exceptional element can be thus rewritten in the form
~s = exp{i(e1 + e2)}t, where

t = exp {i(qr3e3 + . . . + q1er1)}

(c.2)

with the condition 0  q1  . . . qr3  1. the volume of the fundamental alcove is
vdom = 1/(r  3)!. taking a2 = exp{i} as the rst element of the triple, we can pick

27

up a heisenberg pair in l2 = [su(2)]3 formed by the roots (, , ). the canonical triple
(a2, b2, c2) thus constructed lies in l2. it can be conjugated to the form

a2 = 1234 ,

b2 = 122r12r ,

c2 = 132r12r+1

(c.3)

which coincides with eq.(1.5) up to the change 5  2r  1, 6  2r, 7  2r + 1. the
fact that it can be embedded in spin(7) is seen quite directly, but an universal way to
demonstrate this which works also for exceptional groups is to trade the root  for

 =

    2

2

= 1 + . . . + r2

(c.4)

the roots (, , ) present a system of simple roots for spin(7).

the element (c.2) lies in the torus t2 which commutes with this spin(7). the torus
presents a subset of the domain {0  qj  4} (indeed, exp{4iej} = 1). for r > 4,
this domain (one may call it large torus) should, however, be factorized by identications
{qj} : (0, . . . , 0)  (2, 2, 0, . . . , 0)  . . . ( indeed, exp{2i(e3 + e4)} = . . . = 1) . as is not
dicult to see, the corresponding factor group involves 2r4 elements and the volume of
the torus is vtor = 4r3/2r4 = 2r2. thereby, the fundamental alcove (c.2) is obtained
from the torus by factorization with a nite group with

vtor
vdom

= (r  3)!  2r2

(c.5)

elements. in the rst place, this factorization is due to the action of the weyl group wm
of the centralizer of our canonical triple. the continuous part of the latter is spin(2r 6).
15 the corresponding weyl group wdr3 involves (r 3)!2r4 elements (the permutations
of ej,
j = 3, . . . , r  1 and the reection of a pair ej1  ej1, ej2  ej2). however, a
centralizer of our canonical triple involves also an additional discrete z2 factor. indeed,
the triple (c.3) commutes with the element 2452r of the spin(2r + 1) group. the
conjugation of a generic triple by such an element amounts to the reection with respect
qr3  qr3. all together we obtain the group with (r  3)!  2r3 elements
to e3:
involving all possible permutations and reections of ej, j = 3, . . . , r  1. this is the
group wbr3. thus wm coincides with the weyl group of the maximal centralizer of the
triple [spin(2r  5) in this case] and we will see that this is also true in all other cases.

besides, as was explained in sect. 4, there might be conjugations corresponding to a
multiplication by a nontrivial element of the center of spin(7) which belongs also to the
torus. indeed, the element exp{2ie3}  exp{2ie4}  . . . = 1 of the torus belongs to
the center of spin(7) which is z2 [in this simple case, it belongs also to the center of the
large group spin(2r + 1) , but this will not be so for the exceptional groups].

the elements of wbr3 act on all elements of the triple simultaneously while the
elements of z2 act on each component separately. we arrive thereby at the result (4.14).
ii) spin(2r), r > 4. all calculations are exactly parallel to the calculations for
spin(2r + 1). one only has to substitute r  r  1 in all formulae. the canonical triple

15this is so for the triple (c.3). as was mentioned before, one can also choose a triple whose centralizer
is larger = spin(2r  5). such a triple cannot, however, be embedded in c2 = spin(7) and is not
convenient for our purposes.

is conveniently embedded in spin(8) ( and further in spin(7) ). there is an element of
the torus t2 which coincides with the element 1 of the center of spin(8). another non
trivial element of center(spin(8)), 9 = 1    8, does not belong to the torus, however.
hence, 2[spin(2r)] = z2. in this case, the canonical triple has a maximal centralizer
spin(2r  7) and w2 = wbr4.

iii) f4. the dynkin diagram is depicted in fig. 4. fisrt, there are two isolated

3exceptional triples with the rst element a3 = expn 2i

let us study the structure of the fundamental alcove and of the torus t2 associated

3 o,  = 3 + 6 + 4 + 2.

with the nodes with a

j = 2. we have

form

 =

    2

2

=  +  + 2

(c.8)

note that the highest root  for f4 is also the highest root for its c2 subgroup spin(7).
this property also holds for spin groups [cf. eq.(c.4)] and for higher exceptional groups.
the full torus exp{is} corresponds to the domain (0  s  4) (exp{4i} = 1
due to the property exp{2i} = 1 for any coroot ) and is 4 times larger than the
fundamental alcove (c.7). the factorization over z2 comes from the weyl group of our
1dimensional torus wa1 = z2 (with the nontrivial element acting as s  s). another
z2 = 2(f4) corresponds to the shift s  s + 2. indeed, exp{2i} = exp{i} = 1
as far as the spin(7) with the simple roots () is concerned.

iv) e6. the dynkin diagram is depicted in fig. 5. there are two isolated 3-exceptional

triples associated with the node  with the rst element

a3 = exp(cid:26)2i

(cid:27) ,  = 2( + ) + 4( + ) + 6 + 3

figure 5: dynkin diagram for e6.

note that they can be embedded further in f4. indeed, the embedding f4  e6 is
realized by gluing the nodes of the dynkin diagram for e6 to its mirror images: the
root  is glued together with the root  and the root  together with the root . to be
quite exact, the coroots of the subgroup f4 are expressed via the coroots of e6 as follows:

(, , , )notation as in fig.4 = (, ,  + ,  + )notation as in fig.5

(c.10)

one can see directly that the 3exceptional element (c.9) for e6 is also the 3exceptional
element for f4. two other elements of the e6 triple present the heisenberg pairs in the
su(3) factors formed by the nodes (, ), (, ) and (, ). when going from e6 down
to f4, two latter subgroups are glued together so that the second and the third element
of the e6 triple coincide with the second and the third element of the f4 triple.

the root  lies in the center of the dynkin diagram for spin(8) for which  serves as the
highest root.

the full torus corresponds to the rhombus in fig. 6. indeed,

exp{2i(1 + 2)} = exp{2i(21  2)} = exp{2i(22  1)} = . . . = 1

( with the property exp{2ij} = 1 repeatedly used).
it is 24 times larger than the
fundamental alcove (the small triangle in fig. 6 ). the factorization by 24 comes rst
from the weyl group of the small torus wa2 ( # wa2 = 6) and, second, from the group
2 which coincides in this case with the full center of spin(8) which is z2  z2. indeed,
the elements

exp{i(1 + 2)}, exp{i(21  2)}, exp{i(22  1)}

(c.15)

of the torus (marked out by the blobs in fig. 6) depend only on the roots , ,  and
belong therefore to our subgroup c2(e6) = spin(8). as the whole torus commutes with
this spin(8), the elements (c.15) present 3 dierent nontrivial elements of its center.

appendix d: minimal nontrivial ntuples.

the main subject of this paper were the nontrivial commuting triples. but one can
equally well be interested in nontrivial quadruples, quintuples etc. if we dene a non
trivial ntuple as an (ordered) set of n commuting elements which cannot be simultane-
ously conjugated to the maximal torus, they are abundant in any group which admits a

35

nontrivial triple: just pick up such a triple and complete it with arbitrary n3 commuting
elements from the centralizer of this triple.

it is clear that the classication of nontrivial commuting ntuples is reduced to the

classication of ntuples of a special kind which we will call minimal:

denition. a minimal commuting ntuple is a nontrivial commuting ntuple such

that its any melement subset with m < n is a trivial mtuple.

example d1 [14] . consider the following set of 4 elements of so(16):

1 = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
2 = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
3 = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
4 = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

(d.1)

this quadruple is a natural generalization of the nontrivial triple in spin(8) written in
[4]: write a 4  16 matrix whose columns are all possible 4vectors with coordinates 1
taken once; then the 4 rows of this matrix viewed as diagonal matrices in so(16) is the
quadruple (d.1).

obviously, [i, j] = 0, and also the liftings of i up to spin(16):

1 = 12345678
2 = 12349101112
3 = 12569101314
4 = 13579111315

(d.2)

[a direct generalization of eq.(1.5)] commute.

the quadruple (d.2) is nontrivial. indeed, consider the centralizer g 1 = [spin(8)
spin(8)]/z2. in this case, the presence of the z2 factor over which the product spin(8) 
spin(8) is factorized is irrelevant. what is relevant is that each spin(8) factor admits
a nontrivial triple. it is not dicult to see that ( 2, 3, 4) present indeed a non
trivial triple in each spin(8) factor. therefore, ( 2, 3, 4) cannot be conjugated to
the maximal torus in g 1 and the whole quadruple (d.2) cannot be conjugated to the
maximal torus in spin(16).

on the other hand, any pair like ( 2, 3) can be conjugated to the maximal torus in
g 1 and hence the triple ( 1, 2, 3) can be conjugated to the maximal torus in g. also
the triple ( 2, 3, 4) is trivial. one can be directly convinced that it can be conjugated
to the maximal torus in spin(16) involving the generators

t1,9, . . . , t8,16 .

(d.3)

this torus kind of mixes two spin(8) factors in g 1.

thereby, the quadruple (d.2) is a minimal quadruple. since spin(16) involves a
unique up to conjugacy element whose centralizer involves two spin(8) factors and since
there is a unique up to conjugacy triple ( 2, 3, 4) in spin(8)  spin(8) which is non
trivial in both factors, it follows that all minimal quadruples in spin(16) are equivalent

36

by conjugation to eq.(d.2): the quadruple (d.2) is isolated. the quadruple (d.2) does
not involve 16 and presents obviosly also a minimal isolated quadruple in spin(15) [its
image in so(15) coincides with eq.(d.1) with the last column crossed out].

example d2. the construction of example d1 is easily generalized to minimal n
tuples with arbitrary n  4. write a 42n matrix whose columns are all possible nvectors
with coordinates 1 taken once and treat the rows as a set of n diagonal so(2n) matrices.
it is not dicult to see that the set of the corresponding n elements in spin(2n) presents a
minimal ntuple. indeed, take one of such elements 1 in spin(2n) presenting a product
of some 2n1 gammamatrices. the centralizer g 1 is [spin(2n1)  spin(2n1)]/z2.
one can see by induction that the set 2, . . . , n of remaining n  1 elements of our set
presents the minimal (n  1)tuple in each spin(2n1) factor. therefore this set is not
conjugable to the maximal torus in the centralizer and the whole set of n elements in not
conjugable to the maximal torus in spin(2n). this nontrivial ntuple is minimal: any
set of n  1 elements including 1 is conjugable to the maximal torus due to the fact that
the (n  1)tuple 2, . . . , n is minimal in each simple factor of g 1, and also the set
2, . . . , n is conjugable to the maximal torus in spin(2n): this torus is formed by the
generators t1,2n1+1, . . . , t2n1,2n.

the constructed ntuple in spin(2n) is isolated and presents obviously also an isolated

ntuple in spin(2n  1).

the minimal ntuples exist also for spin(n) groups with n = 2n + 2s and n =
2n + 2s  1, s > 0, but they are not isolated anymore, a moduli space appears. consider a
subgroup spin(2n)  spin(n) and pick up the minimal ntuple 1, . . . , n in spin(2n).
its centralizer is a group of rank s. let its maximal torus be t s. the set of elements
1t1, . . . , ntn , tj  t s presents also a minimal ntuple. thus, for n > 2n the moduli
space of minimal ntuples is a subset of 1t s      nt s. moreover, one can easily
generalize the analysis of section 4 and appendix c to this case and nd the moduli space
exactly. we have

mspin(2n+2s1)

ntuple

= mspin(2n+2s)

ntuple

= " 1t s

z2

    

nt s
z2 #, wbs ,

(d.4)

where wbs is the weyl group of the maximal centralizer of a minimal ntuple in spin(n)
[this centralizer is spin(2s+1)] and z2 is the intersection of t s with the center of spin(2n)
or spin(2n  1) for even and odd n, respectively. 17

example d3. consider the group e8 and take the element g = exp{i} [the
notations are as in fig. 8]. by theorem 1, its centralizer is spin(16)/z2. take the
minimal quadruple (d.2) in spin(16). denote by q the corresponding set of e8 elements.
the same reasoning as before shows that the quintuple (g, q) is nontrivial. on the other
hand, we will see later that e8 does not admit minimal quadruples which means that q
is trivial in e8. it follows then that our quintuple is minimal. note that, as is also the
case for the minimal quadruple (d.2) and all nontrivial triples and minimal ntuples
considered before, the rst element g in the quintuple (g, q) does not play a special role:
all other elements of this quintuple are equivalent to g by conjugation.

17the groups spin(2n) or spin(2n  1) are the centralizers of t s in large spin(n ) group and play
the role of the subgroups cm listed in table 4 which were relevant when discussing the moduli space of
nontrivial commuting triples.

theorem d1. (a) su(n) and sp(n) contain no nontrivial ntuples.
(b) spin(n) for n < 15 and the groups g2, f4, e6, e7 contain no minimal ntuples

for n > 3.

(c) e8 contains no minimal ntuples for n = 4 and n > 5. e8 contains a unique up to

conjugacy minimal quintuple and it is described in example d3.

(d) all minimal ntuples with n > 3 in spin(n), n  15 are described in example

d2.

proof. (a) is well known (and follows from theorem 1c). next, if a1 is an element of a
minimal ntuple (a1, . . . , an) in g with n > 3, then at least one of the simple components
of ga1 should not be of a or c type. indeed, otherwise either the preimage (a2, . . . , an)
in ga1 is a trivial (n  1)tuple in which case the whole ntuple is trivial in g [due to (a)]
or some pair ai, aj (1 < j < j  n) does not commute in which case the triple (a1, ai, aj)
is nontrivial contradicting the minimality assumption.

(b). the centralizer of any element of spin(7) or spin(8) not belonging to the center
presents a product of simple factors of a or c type and the remark above applies. consider
spin(9) and suppose that it contains a a minimal ntuple (a1, . . . , an) with n  4. by
the same remark, the only possibilities for the semisimple part of ga1 ( and for all gai as
well) to be discussed are spin(7) or spin(8) (see theorem 1) and (a2, . . . , an) should be
a nontrivial (n  1)tuple in ga1. we have just shown that spin(7) and spin(8) do not
admit minimal ntuples with n  4, hence ga1 should contain a nontrivial triple. a non
trivial triple of spin(8) presents also a nontrivial triple in its subgroup spin(7). but it
follows from appendix c and section 4 that the isolated triple (a, b, c) in spin(7) remains
nontrivial in spin(9) and that all nontrivial triples in spin(9) are up to conjugacy of
the form

(at1, bt2, ct3) ,

(d.5)

where ti lie in a maximal torus of the centralizer of spin(7) in spin(9). hence our ntuple
is not minimal.

consider spin(n), 9 < n < 15. the centralizer of any element of such a group
can involve only one simple factor which is not of a or c type, and this factor is of
spin(m < n) (i.e. b or d) type. for an ntuple (a1, . . . , an) to be nontrivial, the
(n  1)tuple (a2, . . . , an) should be nontrivial in ga1. using the previous results and
inductive reasoning, we deduce that ga1 and its spin(m) factor should contain a non
trivial triple. again, the analysis of appendix c and section 4 shows that any such triple
is of the form (d.5) where (a, b, c) is a canonical triple built up according to the rules
of appendix c which can be embedded in spin(7), and ti lie on the maximal torus of
the centralizer of the canonical triple [and spin(7)] in spin(m). the same applies to
spin(n). these maximal tori can be embedded one into another and hence a nontrivial
triple of spin(m) is also a nontrivial triple in spin(n).

let now g be one of the exceptional groups. a centralizer of any element in g2
involves only semisimple factors of a or c type and hence g2 does not contain a non
trivial ntuple with n > 3. consider f4. there are elements with centralizer involving the
factor spin(7) or spin(9). again, the construction of the appendix c and the reasoning
above can be used to show that any nontrivial triple of spin(7) or spin(9) remains also
nontrivial in f4. in the e6 case, the only possible semisimple factors in the centralizer

38

which are not of a or c type are spin(8) or spin(10), and we argue in the same way as
for spin(9) and f4. in the e7 case, the only possible semisimple factors in the centralizer
which are not of a or c type are spin(8), spin(10) , spin(12) or e6, and we argue in
the same way as above.

to prove (c), note rst that the only interesting possibilities for the simple factors of
(the universal covering of) the centralizer of an element g  e8 (the factors which are not
of a or c type ) are the following: (i) e7, e6, spin(12), spin(10), spin(8); (ii) spin(16),
and there can be only one such interesting factor. arguing as above , we show that any
nontrivial triple of ga1 remains nontrivial in e8, hence e8 has no minimal quadruples.
in case (i), ga1 contains no minimal ntuples for n  4 and hence e8 has no nontrivial
ntuples for n  5. in the remaining case (ii), ga1 = spin(16)/z2 contains a unique
up to conjugacy minimal quadruple which gives us the unique up to conjugacy minimal
quintuple in e8 constructed in example d3.

also e8 contains no minimal ntuples with n > 5 since ga1 contains no minimal

ntuples with n  5 (see example d2 and also the nal part of the proof).

consider nally the groups spin(n), n  15. let us explain rst why the reasoning
used for the groups with n < 15 does not work in this case. the assumption that
spin(n) contains a nontrivial quadruple (a1, a2, a3, a4) allows one to conclude that the
triple (a2, a3, a4) is nontrivial in the centralizer ga1. if ga1 involves only one simple factor
admitting a nontrivial triple, we can argue as above to show that the triple (a2, a3, a4)
remains nontrivial in spin(n), etc. but for n  15, there is at least one element
g  spin(n) such that the semisimple part of its centralizer gg has two simple factors
admitting a nontrivial triple. let a1 be such an element and let k and h be such factors.
by theorem 1, k  spin(m1) and h  spin(m2) with m1,2  7 and m1 + m2  n.
a nontrivial triple in ga1 can in this case be of dierent types. in can be nontrivial in
only one such factor and be trivial in another factor. in that case, the triple (a2, a3, a4)
can be presented in the form (d.5), i.e. it remains nontrivial in spin(n).

but a triple which is nontrivial both in k and in h becomes trivial in the large group.
indeed, a nontrivial triple in k has the form (aktk
3 ) where (ak, bk, ck) 
spin(7)  k and tk
lie on the maximal torus t k of the centralizer of the canonical triple
i
(ak, bk, ck) in k. the same concerns the triple in h. one can choose now a maximal
torus in spin(n) which involves t k, t h, and also the torus formed by the generators like
in eq.(d.3) which mix two spin(7) factors embedding the canonical triples (ak, bk, ck)
and (ah, bh , ch). it is clear that this maximal torus contains the triple (a2, a3, a4) which
is thereby trivial and the quadruple (a1, a2, a3, a4) is minimal.

2 , cktk

1 , bktk

in the range 15  n < 31, the spin(n) groups admit minimal quadruples, but not
minimal quintuples, 6tuples etc. the reason is that the centralizer of any element of such
spin(n) group contains at most one simple factor admitting a minimal quadruple and the
reasoning which proves the clause (b) above works in this case. starting from spin(31),
the elements whose centralizer involves two simple factors admitting a minimal quadruple
appear. let a1 be such element and let (a2, a3, a4, a5) presents a minimal quadruple in
each such factor. arguing as above we show that the quadruple (a2, a3, a4, a5) is trivial in
spin(n) and the quintuple (a1, . . . , a5) is minimal. likewise, the groups spin(n) admit
minimal 6tuple starting from n = 63, etc.

for n > 2n, minimal ntuples form the moduli space (d.4).

remark d1. the minimal quintuple of e8 is equivalent to that constructed in
ref.[15], which denes via the adjoint representation a z5
2  gradation of the lie algebra of
e8 such that the eigenspaces attached to all nontrivial characters of z5
2 are 8dimensional
(and that with a trivial character is trivial). likewise, the isolated triples consisting of
mexceptional elements with prime m of g2, spin(7), spin(8), f4, e6, and e8 dene,
respectively, z3
5  gradations of the lie algebras such that the
eigenspaces attached to all nontrivial characters are 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, and 2dimensional,
respectively [15].

similarly, the isolated quadruples for spin(15) [resp. spin(16)] dene z4

2gradations
of the corresponding lie algebra with eigenspaces of dimensions 7 (resp. 8), the isolated
quintuples for spin(31) [resp. spin(32)] dene z5
2gradations of the corresponding lie
algebra with eigenspaces of dimensions 15 (resp. 16), etc.

let us illustrate the spin(7) example. as was noted in ref.[5], the standard generators
tij = iij/2 of the spin(7) lie algebra either are invariant or change sign under conju-
gation by the elements of the triple (1.5). the z3
2gradation subdivides 21 generators of
spin(7) in 7 classes involving each 3 commuting generators as in table 9.

remark d2.

in a connected, but not simply connected g, the classication of
commuting pairs follows from theorem a1, and the classication of minimal commuting
ntuples for n > 2 follows from that in the simply connected cover of g.
if g is not
connected, nontrivial 1tuples appear which are classied by gantmachers theorem
[9]. thereby, we have the classication of minimal commuting ntuples in any compact
lie group g.

the problem of classication the nontrivial triples is related to the problem of count-
ing the vacuum states in 4dimensional supersymmetric yangmills theory. we are not
aware about possible physical applications of the problem of classication of minimal
ntuples, but it does not mean that such applications do not exist.
