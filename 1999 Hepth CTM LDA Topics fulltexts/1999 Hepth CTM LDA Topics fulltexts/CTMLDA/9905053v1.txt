we review some of the uses of whitham hierarchies in the context of the theory of the
prepotential in n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories. we focus on the structure of the
contact terms in the twisted topological theory, and on the connection between whitham
hierarchies and the u-plane integrals for higher rank gauge groups, trying to put together
the dierent approaches involved in this connection. we also review two other uses of
the whitham hierarchies: the interpretation of the slow times as supersymmetry breaking
parameters, and the new techniques to extract instanton corrections using the rg equations
written in terms of theta functions.

introduction

shortly after seiberg and witten discovered the exact solution for the low energy
eective action of n = 2 supersymmetric su (2) gauge theories 1), it was realized
that this solution, as well as the generalizations to other gauge groups, could be
interpreted in the framework of integrable systems 2), 3). this connection, which is
largely based on a common description in terms of riemann surfaces and their ja-
cobians, has essentially involved two ingredients: the rst ingredient has been the
identication of an integrable classical mechanical system whose associated spectral
curve reproduces the curve describing the low energy dynamics of the gauge theory.
for example, for pure yang-mills theories, the relevant integrable system turns out
to be the periodic toda chain 4), while in the case of the mass deformed n = 4
theory, the corresponding system is calogero-moser 5), 6), 7) (which is in turn equiv-
alent to the hitchin system described in 3)). the second ingredient is the theory
of the prepotential: once the integrable system has been identied, one considers
the quasiclassical whitham hierarchy associated to the original hierarchy, which is
constructed by introducing slow times instead of the original, fast times 8). the
prepotential of the eective theory turns out to be, essentially, the logarithm of the
quasiclassical tau function and hence depends on the slow times of the corresponding
whitham hierarchy 2), 9), 6).

although there are general and rigorous arguments showing that the eective
n = 2 theories should be governed by integrable systems 3), 10), there is for the mo-
ment no dynamical reason to explain why they are described by these particular one-
dimensional mechanical systems. nevertheless, this remarkable connection between
two a priori unrelated elds has been very fruitful. for example, the connection to
integrable systems gives a unifying approach to nd the seiberg-witten curves for

the dierent gauge groups, because both toda and calogero-moser systems can be
formulated for any lie algebra. in this paper, we will focus on the second aspect of
the connection, namely the theory of the prepotential in the framework of whitham
hierarchies, and we will try to show that this framework is not only an elegant way
to describe the prepotential, but also the appropriate point of view to understand
some important aspects of n = 2 gauge theories. the main reason for this is that
within the whitham approach one can consider an enlarged prepotential with ex-
tra parameters. consider, for simplicity, the case of pure su (n ) super yang-mills
theory. in this case, the usual seiberg-witten prepotential f(ai , ) is a holomor-
phic function of the coordinates of the moduli space, ai , where i = 1, , n  1,
and the dynamically generated scale of the theory, . the theory of whitham hi-
erarchies provides a generalized prepotential f(ai , tn), where tn, n = 1, , n  1,
are the slow times of the whitham hierarchy. this prepotential is a deformation of
the seiberg-witten prepotential, in the sense that, if we put t1 = , tn>1 = 0, we
recover the original function f(ai , ).
there are two contexts where deformations of the prepotential can be relevant.
the rst context is the study of contact terms in the twisted version of n = 2 gauge
theories. these contact terms, as we will explain, appear when one computes the gen-
erating functional of a certain class of operators, and the source terms for insertions
of these operators can be regarded as deformations of the original action. the other
context is the study of soft supersymmetry breaking terms, which can also be under-
stood as deformations of the theory. in both cases, the deformations of the action
can be described in terms of the whitham time variables of the enlarged prepoten-
tial. in this paper, we will mainly focus on the relation between the contact terms in
twisted n = 2 theories and the theory of the prepotential from whitham hierarchies.
the issue of contact terms has been previously addressed in 11), 12), 13), 14), 15), 16), 17)
from dierent points of view. we will try to put together these approaches using the
relation to integrable systems as a unifying framework. we will also review the uses
of whitham hierarchies in the study of soft supersymmetry breaking, as explained
in 18).

an extra bonus of the whitham approach to the theory of the prepotential is a
set of renormalization group (rg) equations for the prepotential in terms of theta
functions associated to the root lattice of the gauge group 17). it was shown in 18)
that these equations give an elegant way to derive the instanton expansion of the
prepotential following a recursive procedure. we will also review very briey the
strategy of the computation, and we will present some of the results obtained so far.
the organization of the paper is as follows: in section 2, we explain the structure
of contact terms in twisted n = 2 yang-mills theory. in section 3, we show how the
contact terms can be understood from the point of view of whitham hierarchies. in
section 4, we study the connection between the blowup formula in twisted yang-mills
theory and the toda-whitham approach. in section 5, we review, following 18), the
uses of whitham hierachies in the problem of soft supersymmetry breaking in n = 2
theories. in section 6 we present some results on instanton expansions using the rg
equations. finally, in section 7 we state some conclusions and open problems.

2. contact terms in twisted n =2 yang-mills theory

2.1. twisted n = 2 yang-mills theory

one of the most important aspects of n = 2 yang-mills theories is their relation
to donaldson theory. it is a well-known fact that any n = 2 theory in four dimen-
sions can be twisted to obtain a topological quantum eld theory (tqft), i.e. a
quantum eld theory whose correlation functions are formally metric-independent
(for a review of tqft and the twisting procedure, see for example 19), 20).) in the
case of n = 2 yang-mills, the correlation functions of the twisted theory are in
fact the famous donaldson invariants of four-manifolds 21). in this section, we will
consider some aspects of this twisted theory for the gauge group su (n ) on a simply-
connected four-manifold x. in the following, r = n  1 will denote the rank of the
group.
the rst thing to do is to identify the gauge-invariant operators of the twisted
theory. the twisted theory is characterized by the existence of a brst charge
or topological charge q (which is in fact a particular combination of the original
supersymmetric charges of the n = 2 theory), and the operators of the twisted
theory have to be brst invariant. these operators are called observables. the
simplest observables of the theory are precisely the casimirs of the gauge group,
which we will take to be the elementary symmetric polynomials in the eigenvalues
of the complex scalar eld  of the n = 2 vector multiplet:

ok =

1
k

trk + lower order terms, k = 2, . . . , n.

(2.1)

starting with these operators, one can generate the rest of the observables through
the so-called descent procedure. to do this, one needs another operator in the twisted
theory, the descent operator g which has spin one and comes from another com-
bination of the susy charges. acting with g n times on the casimir operators
ok one generates an n-form, the integration of this n-form on an n-cycle on x is
another observable, called the n-th topological descendant of ok. as we are assum-
ing that the manifold x is simply connected, the topological descendants will be
constructed with two-cycles s in x:

ik(s) =zs

g2ok =

1

kzs

tr(k1f ) + . . . ,

(2.2)

where f is the yang-mills eld strength. the basic problem of the tqft is to
compute the generating function for the correlators of observables:

(pkok + fkik(s))(cid:17)itwisted theory.

(2.3)

z(pk, fk, s) = hexp(cid:16)xk
si, i = 1, . . . , b2(x), i. e. s =pb2(x)

i=1

notice that, in general, s will be an arbitrary linear combination of basic two-cycles

tisi, therefore

ik(s) =

b2(x)xi=1

tiik(si).

(2.4)

4

marcos marino

in total, we have r  b2(x) independent operators ik(si).
the computation of (2.3) can be done using the low energy exact solution of
n = 2, su (n ) yang-mills theory. this solution is encoded in the hyperelliptic
curve 22)

y2 = p 2(x, uk)  42n ,

(2.5)

where p (x, uk) = xn pn
k=2 ukxn k is the characteristic polynomial of su (n ), and
uk = hoki are the vevs of the casimir operators (2.1). this curve has genus g = r,
and, as explained in 2), 4), it can be identied with the spectral curve of the n site
periodic toda lattice. associated to this curve, there is a meromorphic dierential
of the second kind, with a double pole at innity, that can be explicitly written as:

dssw = p (x, uk)

xdx

y

.

this one-form satises the equation:

dssw
uk+1

= k,

(2.6)

(2.7)

where k = xk1dx/y is a basis of holomorphic dierentials. let i and d,i denote
a symplectic basis of homology cycles for this curve, i = 1, . . . , r. the ai variables
of the prepotential f(ai , ), for the duality frame associated to the cycles i , are
given by the integrals over these cycles of dssw

ai (uk, ) =

1

2iii

xp (uk, x)

qp 2(uk)  42n

dx.

(2.8)

the same expression holds for the dual variables ad,i with d,i instead of i . finally,
the eective gauge couplings ij are just the components of the riemann matrix
associated to the hyperelliptic curve (2.5). a fundamental aspect of the low-energy
description of n = 2 gauge theories is that one has to choose a duality frame, which
in the language of riemann surfaces can be understood as a choice of the symplectic
basis i , d,i. dierent duality frames are related by symplectic transformations of
the form

 =(cid:18) a b

c d(cid:19)  sp(2r, z).

(2.9)

2.2. the integral over the coulomb branch

the moduli space of the hyperelliptic curve (2.5) is parametrized by the vevs
of the casimirs uk. for some values of these vevs, the curve will be singular.
the singular locus is precisely the divisor d dened by the vanishing locus of the
discriminant of (2.5),  = 0. it is well known that on this divisor there are extra
bps states that become massless. the coulomb branch of the n = 2 theory is then
dened as

the basic principle to compute the generating function (2.3) has been introduced
by moore and witten in 11) and states that this function is given by the sum of two

mcoulomb = cr  d.

dierent contributions: one comes from the coulomb branch, and the other comes
from the divisor d:

z = zcoulomb + zd.

(2.11)

the rst piece is given by an integral over the coulomb branch, while the second
piece involves, in general, seiberg-witten invariants associated to the extra massless
in this paper, we will focus on zcoulomb following 12), 13). as shown
bps states.
in 11), 13), this contribution is dierent from zero only when b+
2 (x) = 1. the explicit
expression of this integral can be worked out using the low-energy eective action
encoded in (2.5) and reads

zcoulomb =zmcoulomb

[dada]a(uk)b(uk)ep pkuk+s2p fkfltk,l.

(2.12)

the integrand of (2.12) has various ingredients. first of all, there is a gravitational
part rst studied in 23) in the su (2) case, and generalized in 12), 13), 15) to simply-laced
groups. this part involves the factors:

a(uk) =  det

uk

ai!/2

,

b(uk) = /8
 .

(2.13)

the rst factor is a modular form of weight (/2, 0), and b(uk) is a modular
invariant. in these equations, ,  are constants. notice that the quantities involved
here are very natural quantities associated to the hyperelliptic curve (2.5), namely,
the determinant of the matrix of periods of k, and the discriminant of the curve.

another ingredient in (2.12) is  , which is given by a sum over a lattice  . in

order to write this quantity, lets introduce the following notation:

vi xk

fk

uk
ai .

(2.14)

we also need some geometrical ingredients. as we are on a manifold of b+
2 (x) = 1,
given a metric g there exists a unique anti-self-dual form   h 2,+(x, r) such that
2 = 1. the self-dual part of a two-form is then given by + = (, ), where (,) is
the usual product in cohomology. the lattice sum in  comes essentially from the
evaluation of the partition function of the photons in the eective u (1)r gauge theory.
a topological sector in the eective theory is specied by r 2-forms i  h 2(x, r).
the lattice  consists of vectors of the form

~ =

rxi=1

i ~i ,

(2.15)

where {~i}i=1,...,r are the simple roots of su (n ).) in terms of these quantities, 
can be written as follows:

(2.16)

where ~ is the weyl vector, w2(x) is the second stiefel-whitney class of x, and i ,
i are grassmannian coordinates which arise from the zero modes of the fermion
elds in the theory. fijk denote the third derivatives of the prepotential. notice
that  depends explicitly on the metric of x through the two-form . it is precisely
this dependence which leads to the wall-crossing phenomena of donaldson theory in
manifolds with b+

2 (x) = 1, when the gauge group is su (2) 11).

in (2.12) we have also included some terms of the form tk,ls2 in the exponential.
these terms, which are proportional to the intersection form of the two-cycles, are the
contact terms that we want to study. to understand the origin of these terms, notice
that the operators ik(s) that we have introduced in (2.4) are non-local operators.

these operators have a low-energy counterpart eik(s) which can be obtained using

the descent procedure in the eective abelian theory, and have been included in  .
but if we consider products of operators, and we go to the low-energy theory, we
rather expect an extra contribution localised on the intersection of the surfaces that
support the operators:

ik(s1)ik(s2)  eik(s1)eik(s2) + tk,l(s1  s2).

this is precisely what we have taken into account in (2.12) by introducing the contact
terms tk,l. it is important to notice that these terms are not predicted a priori by
the seiberg-witten solution for the low-energy eective action. one has to nd extra
conditions in order to be able to nd their structure.

(2.17)

2.3. the structure of the contact terms

to have more information on the contact terms, the rst step is to write the
integrand of (2.12) in a way that makes manifest the behavior under symplectic
transformations. one introduces, then, the following generalized siegel-narain theta
function:

 (ij , i , i ; p, i ) = exp"i(i , i ) +

(2.21)

the factor in the second line of (2.21) is a modular invariant (notice that, as x is
simply connected,  = 2+b2(x)). we then see that this expression for the generating
function (except for the exponential involving s2) is the integral of a duality invariant
object over a moduli space parametrized by the vevs of the casimirs, which are
duality invariant coordinates. this is precisely what we expect on physical grounds:
the generating function is a physical quantity and cannot depend on the choice of
duality frame in the eective theory. this argument in fact forces the exponent in s2
to be a modular invariant as well, and this gives the rst constraint on the contact
terms: the quantity

tk,l +

ai [(im )1]ij ul

(2.22)

must be invariant under the action of the symplectic group sp(2r, z). the other
constraint on the contact terms has to do with their physical origin: these terms
are quantum corrections and vanish at tree level, therefore they have to go to zero
in the semiclassical region of moduli space (i.e. when /ai  0). the duality
transformation of the second term in (2.22) is easily worked out, and one nds that
under a duality transformation it is shifted by:

(2.23)

the transformation of the contact term should compensate for this shift. summa-
rizing the discussion so far, we have found the following constraints for the contact
terms:

as shown in 11), these two properties determine the contact terms unambigu-

ously. the problem, of course, is to nd explicit expressions for them.

in the case of the pure yang-mills theory with gauge group su (2), the only
contact term is t2,2. the solution to the constraints above was found in 11), and the
result was expressed in terms of the eisenstein series e2( ). a general procedure
to nd t2,2 was described in 12), 13) by using the so-called rg equation of n = 2
theories 27), 28), as well as some aspects of the formalism developed in 24), 25), 26). the
rg equation for n = 2 theories states that 27), 28)

for the self-dual theories, 0 is the microscopic coupling constant. the key point is
to consider now the second derivatives of the prepotential. on the one hand, from
(2.25) one has that

easy to see that 2f/ 2

the approach based on the rg equation suggests how to nd tk,l for any k, l. if
one is able to nd some additional variables tn, n = 2, . . . , n  1 in the prepotential,
which are invariant under duality and such that

f
tn  un+1,

(2.31)

then 2f/tktl will have, essentially, the duality properties of the contact term
tk+1,l+1, and one is halfway to the solution of the problem. the two obvious ques-
tions are: can we nd an explicit construction of the generalized variables tn?,
and: can we compute the second derivatives 2f/tktl in terms of elementary
data associated to the seiberg-witten solution? these two questions are answered
in 17) in the armative through the use of the whitham hierarchy approach to the
prepotential, which will be the subject of the next section.

3. whitham hierarchies and contact terms

3.1. whitham hierarchy and seiberg-witten solution

the approach to the theory of the prepotential based on whitham hierarchies
has been developed in 8), 9), 6). in 17) it was shown that, using this approach, one can
derive rg equations with the structure (2.31). we will follow here 17) and also 18).

the usual seiberg-witten dierential is a meromorphic dierential with a second-
order pole at innity, and such that its variations with respect to the moduli uk are
holomorphic dierentials. in order to deform the seiberg-witten theory and to em-
bed it in a larger framework, one considers a series of meromorphic dierentials

dbn (in the notation of 17)), with poles of order n + 1 at innity and satisfying the

condition

= holomorphic.

moduli

ds = xn1

tndbn.

one then introduces a generating functional for these one-forms with auxiliary pa-
rameters tn, n  1:

the parameters tn are precisely the slow times of the whitham hierarchy. one of

the results of 17) is an explicit expression for the meromorphic one-forms dbn:
where(cid:16)p

+ (x) = x, therefore
ds(t1, tn2 = 0) = t1dssw ( = 1). we then see that we recover the usual seiberg-
witten dierential when tn2 = 0. starting with the enlarged dierential (3.2), one
can construct a deformation of the usual seiberg-witten theory. for instance, one
denes the periods of ds as

k=0 ckk. it is easy to check that p 1/n

lution, following 18). we dene the rescaled times tn and vevs uk as folows:

we will now make more precise the relation with the usual seiberg-witten so-

tn = tn/t n

uk = t k

with t1 = 1. it is easy to see that (3.4) can be written as

in particular, after setting t2 = t3 = ... = 0 we nd that

d.

(3.6)

i (uk, t1, tn>1 = 0) = t1ai (uk, 1) = ai (uk,  = t1) .

in conclusion, we may identify t1 with  in the submanifold t2 = t3 = ... = 0,
provided the moduli space is parametrized with uk instead of uk. this shows that
the whitham hierarchy approach to the prepotential gives a deformation of the usual
seiberg-witten theory, in such a way that the quantum scale can be identied with
the rst slow time of the witham hierarchy.

3.2. derivatives of the prepotential and contact terms

as we noticed in the last section, the slow times would be useful for the problem
of the contact terms if they were dual to the higher casimirs, in the sense of
(2.31). we should then compute the derivatives of the prepotential f(, t ). this
computation was the main result of 17). one of the basic ingredients in the answer
is the riemann theta function [~, ~](~| ) and characteristics ~ = (1, . . . , r),
~ = (1, . . . , r):
exphiij (ni + i )(nj + j ) + 2i(ni + i )(i + i )i. (3.7)

in these equations, e(0| ) denotes riemanns theta function with a certain charac-
teristic e, evaluated at the origin;  = 2n, m, n = 1, ..., r = n  1, and derivatives
with respect to tn are taken at constant i . according to 17), the characteristic
e appearing in (3.10)(3.11) is an even, half-integer characteristic associated to a
particular splitting of the roots of the discriminant. notice that the characteristic
e depends on the duality frame. an explicit expression for e in the electric frame
will be given in the next section. the functions hm,n are certain homogeneous

here resp stands for the usual cauchy residue at the point p . we have for instance

2. as we have seen, in
order to recover the seiberg-witten solution, it is better to use the rescaled variables
(, tn2). it is straightforward to reexpress all the formulae in (3.8) as derivatives
of f with respect to i , tn and . most of the factors t1 can be used to promote
uk to uk or, rather, to the homogeneous combinations thereof:

with m, n  2. we will always work with the coordinates  and tn dened in (3.5)
and, therefore, hats will be omitted everywhere.
the rst derivatives of the prepotential with respect to the slow times can be
interpreted as generalized rg equations. these equations show that, indeed, the
slow times tn are dual to the casimirs hn+1, at least in the submanifold tn2 = 0.
one can also work out the transformation properties under the symplectic group
of the second derivatives of the prepotential. to do this, notice that the quantities
hn,m are combinations of gauge invariant vevs, therefore they are invariant under
duality. the slow times are deformation parameters of the theory, and they are
also invariant. the symplectic transformation of the periods i , d,i are the usual
ones for the variables ai , ad,i of the seiberg-witten theory, and one derives the
transformation law for the prepotential obtained in 27), 28)

this transformation law can also be checked on the explicit expressions in (3.10), by
using the transformation law of the theta function under a symplectic transformation:

[~, ~](~| )  ei(det(c + d))1/2 exphit(c + d)1ci[~, ~](~| ), (3.14)

where ei is an eighth root of unity. the transformation law (3.13) is the gener-
alization of (2.27) that we were looking for. we would be tempted to identify the
contact term tk+1,l+1 with the second derivative 2f/tktl, up to a normalization
factor. there are, however, two subtleties one has to take into account in order to
make this identication. the rst one is that, in the above model, the casimirs are
not uk, but the homogeneous combinations hk. therefore, to identify the contact
terms with the second derivatives of the prepotential, we have to dene the operators
ik(s) starting with hk instead of the uk in the descent procedure. this is simply
a redenition of which gauge-invariant operators we take as a basis to construct
the observables. the second subtlety is that the contact terms are not only deter-
mined by their transformation properties. as we discussed in the previous section,

the uses of whitham hierarchies

13

there is the extra constraint that tk,l vanishes semiclassically. lets then analyze the
semiclassical behavior of 2f/tktl. if we use the semiclassical expression for the
eective gauge coupling ij , we nd that:

~+!,
ij log e(0| )  o  2n

z 2n

(3.15)

where z~+ = ~a  ~+, ~a = pi ai ~i , and ~+ are the positive roots. therefore, the
term in 2f/tktl involving this derivative will vanish in the semiclassical region
(/z~+ )  0, for k, l = 1, . . . , n  1 (we take t1 =  here). on the other hand,
hn+1,m+1 does not vanish. therefore, 2f/tktl does not have the required behav-
ior for k, l = 2, . . . , n  1. this can be cured by a redenition of the prepotential.
consider the reduced prepotential

f red = f +



4i xn,m2

tntmhn+1,m+1.

(3.16)

the second derivatives of this prepotential with respect to the slow times are, in the
seiberg-witten submanifold tn2 = 0,

and the contact terms are given by

tktl(cid:17)tn2=0

.

(3.18)

notice that the piece that we substracted in the prepotential has a nonzero classical
limit, while (3.17) is a quantum correction. in other words, the classical limit of the
original prepotential f includes deformations which are quadratic in the slow times.
this is not what we expect in the problem of evaluating the generating function
(2.3). in this generating function, all the deformations are linear in the sources, and
the quadratic terms in these sources that appear in the eective theory (the contact
terms) are only due to quantum eects.

to summarize, we have seen that the prepotential dened in terms of the
whitham hierarchy is the appropriate object to understand the contact terms of
the twisted theory. however, the above remarks suggest that there should be a way
to improve the theory of the prepotential, in such a way that one obtains the reduced
version introduced in (3.16), and that the slow times tn can be associated to any
homogeneous combination of the casimirs of degree n + 1.

4. blowup formula

in this section, we will discuss a further connection between integrable systems
and the coulomb integral, which appears when one considers the blowup formula.
there are three reasons why such a formula is interesting: rst of all, as shown in 15),

14

marcos marino

the behavior under blowup can be used to derive the contact terms. second, as shown
in 13) and further discussed in 16), the blowup formula involves in a direct way the
tau function of the periodic toda lattice which underlies the seiberg-witten curve.
finally, using the blowup formula one can x the characteristic e which appears in
(3.8) 18). of course, this formula is also very important in the context of donaldson
theory, as it makes possible to relate the donaldson invariants of a manifold and its
blowup ). this formula was obtained using the u-plane integral in 11), for the case
of su (2), and generalized to the higher rank case in 13).

suppose that we have a four-manifold x, and we consider the blownup manifold
at a point p, x = blp(x). under this operation, the homology changes as follows 30):

h2(x)  h2( x) = h2(x)  z  b,

(4.1)

where b, the class of the exceptional divisor, satises b2 = 1. as b+
2 (x),
it makes sense to ask how the intergrand of zcoulomb changes under the blowup.
first of all, the blownup manifold x has an extra two-homology class, therefore
there are extra operators ik(b) that must be included in the generating function.
we will then write s = s + tb. we want to compute then:

2 ( x) = b+

*exphxk

(fkik(s) + tkik(b) + pkok)i+ x

,

(4.2)

in terms of correlation functions of the twisted theory on x.
in this equation,
tk  fkt. the rst thing to do is to analyze the change in the integrand under blowup.
this is easy to obtain if we also assume that the metric is such that (b, ) = 0. in
this case, the lattice sum changes as follows:

 x = xni

exphiij ninj + ixk

tk

uk

ai ni  ixi

nii!x,

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

and we see that

where [ ~, 0](~| ) is a theta function with

 x = [ ~, 0](~| )x ,

i =xk

tk

uk
ai ,

~ = (1/2, . . . , 1/2).

notice that we have extracted from the siegel-narain theta function a standard
theta function on the hyperelliptic curve (2.5). the above expression is valid in the
electric frame, and the characteristic of the theta function is inherited from the term
(~  ~, w2(x)) in (2.16).
( x) = (x)  1, the measure picks an extra factor

lets now analyze the measure in the integrand. as ( x) = (x) + 1 and

(4.6)

) it is interesting to notice that the derivation of this formula in 29) was one of the rst hints

of a relation between donaldson theory and elliptic curves.

the uses of whitham hierarchies

15

as a consequence of thomae formulae. putting all these factors together, we see that
the blowup factor in the integrand is given (up to a constant) by:

 (tk|uk) = ep tktltk,l

[ ~, 0](~| )
[ ~, 0](0| )

.

(4.7)

as (4.7) is an extra factor in the integrand of zcoulomb, it follows by our arguments
above that it must be invariant under duality transformations. using (3.14), one
can easily prove that the duality invariance of the blowup factor xes the duality
transformation of the contact terms, and one nds (2.24) again. the reason for the
notation in (4.7) is that the blowup factor is essentially the tau function of the toda
hierarchy (see, for example, 31)). notice that, in this identication, the coupling
constants tk are interpreted as the fast times of the hierarchy. recall that there are
two points of contact between integrable systems and the seiberg-witten solution:
one is the fact that the hyperelliptic curves are spectral curves of periodic toda
chains (for pure yang-mills), and the other is that the prepotential is the logarithm
of the quasiclassical tau function. now, we see that the tau function itself appears
in the twisted version of the theory as a blowup factor. this also gives a very direct
link between donaldson theory and its generalizations, and the hyperelliptic curve
encoding the seiberg-witten solution.

in principle, the blowup factor depends on the moduli of the hyperelliptic curve
in a complicated way. however, it turns out that the blowup factor only depends
on the fast times tk and on the casimirs, as we have indicated with our notation.
more precisely, let ~n = (n2, . . . , nn ) be a vector of nonnegative integers, with |~n| =
n2 + . . . + nn . then, there are polynomials b~n(u2, , un ) in the casimirs such that:

 (tk|uk) = x|~n|0

2  tnn
tn2

n b~n(u2, . . . , un ).

(4.8)

the physical reason for this, as explained in 11), is that one can interpret the blowup
as a local defect created by an analog of the puncture operator. the eect of this
puncture associated to the exceptional divisor should be represented by an innite
number of local observables. the ring of local observables is in fact generated by
u2, . . . , un , and an identity like (4.8) should be valid. one can indeed prove (4.8)
by using duality invariance, r-charge arguments and regularity 13). a consequence
of (4.8) is the following relation between the generating functions:

*exphxk

(fkik(s) + tkik(b) + pkok)i+ x

=*exphxk

(fkik(s) + pkok)i (tk|ok)+x

(4.9)

.

notice that the blowup factor  (tk|uk) does not depend on the manifold x. we have
then proved that the blowup changes the generating function by a universal factor
which can be expressed in terms of the zero observables.

as a corollary of (4.8), we can derive an explicit expression for the contact terms.
the fact that the behavior under blowup can be used to obtain the contact terms
was rst remarked in 15). to obtain the expression, we simply expand (4.7) to second

16

order in tk. the rst derivative of the theta function is zero due to the choice of
characteristic. we then nd:

 (tk|uk) = 1 xk,l tk,l +

2i

ij log [ ~,~0](0| )

uk

because of (4.8), this means that

ij log [ ~,~0](0| )

uk

aj + b~nk,l(u2, . . . , un ),

(4.10)

(4.11)

where ~nk,l are the vectors with |~nk,l| = 2, corresponding to the quadratic terms in
(4.8). the requirement that tk,l vanishes semiclassically implies that b~nk,l(u2, . . . , un ) =
0, and we nally nd:

tk,l = 

1
2i

ij log [ ~,~0](0| )

uk
ai

ul
aj ,

(4.12)

which is the expression found in 15). if we compare now to (3.18), we see that they
have the same structure. the only dierence is due to the fact that the expression in
(3.18) is valid if the descent operators are constructed with the operators hk. here,
instead, we are considering the operators that we dened in (2.2) starting from ok.
an interesting consequence of this rederivation is that we can read the characteristic
e in (3.8) from the expression (4.12):

e = ( ~,~0).

(4.13)

we will provide another check of this identication in the section 6.

to clarify our statement about the existence of the polynomials in (4.8), it is
useful to consider in some detail the su (2) case. the blowup factor is simply given
by 11):

 (t|u) = et2t2,2

du

4( t
da| )
2
4(0| )

,

(4.14)

where 4 is the jacobi theta form with characteristic [1/2, 0], and we put u  u2.
the quotient of these theta functions can be written in terms of a weierstrass sigma
function using the following identity 32):

4(z| )
4(0| )

= e22z2

3(2z),

(4.15)

where 2 is the a-period (i.e.,  = 1/2), and 2 = (2/2). using the expression
for the contact term in (2.29), the identity

2
62

2 =

e2( ),
and the fact that 2 = (8/2)(da/du), one nds:
4t
2

 (t|u) = et2 u

3 3(

(4.16)

)

(4.17)

the uses of whitham hierarchies

17

this is precisely the expression found in 29) in the context of donaldson theory (for
zero magnetic ux). the key fact is that the sigma functions i(t) can be expanded
around the origin, and the coecients of the taylor expansion are polynomials in the
root ei, and the functions g2, g3 (in the weierstrass description). these quantities
depend only on u. from the seiberg-witten curve for the su (2) pure yang-mills
theory one nds in fact:

e3 = 

u

g2 =

4(cid:16) u2
3

4(cid:17),

g3 =

1

48(cid:16) 2u3
9 

u

4(cid:17).

(4.18)

therefore, the expansion of (4.17) is indeed of the form (4.8), and using that

3(t) = 1  e3t2 + o(t4),

(4.19)

it follows that the quadratic term in t in (4.17) is zero, as expected from (4.11).

if we consider now the higher rank case, the above remarks on su (2) suggest
that the expansion in (4.8) should involve some kind of hyperelliptic generalization
of the sigma functions. it is also quite possible that the interpretation in terms of the
toda-whitham hierarchy gives a constructive way of computing these polynomials.

5. soft supersymmetry breaking with higher casimir operators

in this section, we will give a very rough overview of another use of whitham

hierarchies: soft supersymmetry breaking with spurion superelds.

the spurion formalism was introduced in 33) and it is a very useful tool to break
supersymmetry in an explicit way. the starting point of the spurion formalism
is a coupling constant in a supersymmetric lagrangian, call it m. this coupling
constant can be promoted to a supereld, m  m , and this will give another
lagrangian which will be supersymmetric as well. the supereld m is called a
spurion supereld. notice that the original lagrangian is recovered by taking the
vev of the scalar component of m to be equal to m, and setting the rest of the
elds to zero. to break supersymmetry, one gives a vev to an auxiliary eld in
m . the resulting lagrangian will be nonsupersymmetric due to the extra terms
generated in this way. an interesting example is the mass term for the n = 2 quark
hypermultiplet, which in n = 1 superspace has the form:

z d2meqq,

(5.1)

(5.2)

where eq, q are the two n = 1 chiral superelds that correspond to the n = 2 quark
hypermultiplet. if we promote m to an n = 1 chiral supereld:

m  m = m + 2m + 2fm,

we obtain an n = 1 lagrangian, and we recover the original one if we put hmi = m.
if we want to break supersymmetry, we take:

m = m + 2fm.

(5.3)

18

marcos marino

this induces an extra term fm qq (a mass term for the squark) which breaks super-
symmetry down to n = 0. the vev of the auxiliary eld, fm, becomes a susy
breaking parameter. notice that one can also take m = 0, fm 6= 0 to generate a mass
term for the squarks while keeping the quarks massless. this is the usual procedure
to decouple the squarks through soft supersymmetry breaking.

we can try to proceed in the same way with n = 2 gauge theories described by

a prepotential. in the most general case, the prepotential is a function

f = f(i , mf , tn),

(5.4)

where tn are the whitham slow times, and t1 = . in this lagrangian, the variables
i correspond to n = 2 vector superelds, while the rest of the variables are cou-
plings. any of these couplings can be promoted to an n = 2 vector supereld, and
then one breaks supersymmetry by giving vevs to the auxiliary components. this
strategy was followed in 24), 25), 26), 34) in the context of the original seiberg-witten
theory, when tn = 0 for n  2. the only coupling constants are then  and mf . in
the enlarged prepotential, we can construct a more general, nonsupersymmetric de-
formation of seiberg-witten theory, by promoting tn2 to spurion superelds while
setting the vevs of their scalar components to zero (for t1, the scalar component
has to be dierent from zero and equal to the quantum scale ). it is convenient to
dene the couplings sn as

s1 = i log ,

sn = itn, n = 2, . . . , r.

(5.5)

we then promote these couplings to n = 2 vector superelds sn. such a supereld
can be written, in n = 1 language, as one n = 1 chiral supereld (that we will also
denote by sn) and one n = 1 vector supereld vn. we then have, in terms of n = 1
superelds,

s1 = s1 + 2f1

, vs  v1 =

1
2

d12 2 ,

(5.6)

(5.7)

sn = 2fn , vn =

1
2

dn2 2 , n  2.

the whitham times are then interpreted as supersymmetry breaking parameters,
and supersymmetry is broken down to n = 0. to obtain the explicit form of the
soft breaking terms, we can expand the prepotential around sn2 = 0. the terms
of order o(s3) in this expansion do not give any contribution to the lagrangian,
because they involve too many s and the integral in superspace will vanish. to
analyze the softly broken theory, it is enough to consider the terms which are at
most quadratic in the slow times, and the following expression is exact:

f(i , tn) = f(i , t1, 0) +xn2(cid:16) f

tn(cid:17)tn2=0

tn +

1

2 xn,m2(cid:16) 2f

tntm(cid:17)tn2=0

tntm.

(5.8)

the rst term in this expansion is just the seiberg-witten prepotential, after setting
t1 = . notice that the prepotential dened in the whitham framework is dened for
the eective theory. nevertheless, it is easy to see what is the classical prepotential by

the uses of whitham hierarchies

19

going to the semiclassical region and switching o the quantum corrections. again,
it is more convenient to use the reduced prepotential (3.16). in this case, the second
derivatives appearing in (5.8) vanish semiclassically, as we showed in (3.17). the rst
derivatives can be read from (3.11). they are written in terms of casimir operators
and therefore have a well-dened classical limit. we nally obtain the following
expression for the reduced, classical prepotential:

f red
class =


2

n

rxn=1

snhn+1,

(5.9)

where the spurions sn are given in (5.6)(5.7). the microscopic lagrangian asso-
ciated to (5.9) can be written as follows. first, one denes a generalized matrix of
couplings as follows:

where the dots in eq.(5.11) denote the derivative with respect to a of lower or-
der casimir operators. the indices a, b, c, ... belong to the adjoint representation of
su (n ), and are raised and lowered with the invariant metric, and n, m, ... corre-
spond to the variables sn. the complex scalar eld of the n = 2 vector multiplet is
written as  =pa ata, where ta is a basis for the lie algebra of su (n ). finally, 
is the classical gauge coupling, and it is related to the spurion s1 = i log  through
the one loop formula  = ei . we dene now:

b(class) =

gluinos and  is the scalar component of the n = 2 vector supereld. we see that
the spurion that corresponds to s1 gives mass to the gauginos of the n = 2 vector
multiplet and to the imaginary part of the higgs eld . the spurions corresponding

(5.14)

(5.15)

20

marcos marino

to higher casimirs, on the other hand, give couplings between the higgs eld and
the gauginos. notice that the spurion superelds sn have dimensions 1n, therefore
the supersymmetry breaking parameters fn, dn have dimension 2  n. for n > 2,
they will give nonrenormalizable (i.e.
irrelevant) interactions in the microscopic
lagrangian. this does not mean that the resulting perturbations do not change
the low-energy structure of the theory: the operators we are considering can be
dangerously irrelevant operators, as in the related theory analyzed in 36), and in this
case they will aect the infrared physics.

one of the advantages of this procedure to break supersymmetry is precisely
that one can also write the exact low energy eective theory associated to (5.14), up
to two derivatives. this is due to the fact that the dependence of the lagrangian on
the susy breaking parameters is controlled by the dependence of the prepotential
on the spurions, and this is also given by the seiberg-witten solution. notice that, in
the low energy theory, the couplings (5.10)-(5.12) receive quantum corrections, and
can be computed in terms of the hyperelliptic curve data. using these couplings,
one can write down an eective potential and study the vacuum structure of the
theory. the eect of the nonsupersymmetric deformations associated to the higher
order casimirs in the vacuum structure of the theory has been explored in 18).

instanton corrections

in this section we will briey review another use of the whitham hierarchies:

the computation of instanton corrections. for more details, see 18), 35) and 44).

one of the main results of the whitham approach to the theory of the prepoten-
tial have been the equations for the rst and second derivatives of the prepotential
in (3.8) and (3.10) derived in 17). in 27) it was realized that the rg equation

f
 log 

=


4i

u

(6.1)

is very useful to derive a recursion relation for the instanton contributions. in or-
der to compute the instanton corrections, however, (6.1) is not sucient and one
needs additional input. this is usually provided by the picard-fuchs equations for
the periods. the picard-fuchs equations are dicult to derive and solve when the
rank of the gauge group is larger than one, although techniques from topological
landau-ginzburg theories can make them more instrumental in order to obtain the
one-instanton correction to the prepotential for the ade series 40). it turns out that
the equation for 2f/(log )2 in (3.11), together with (6.1), provides enough in-
formation to obtain the instanton expansion of the prepotential in the semiclassical
region to any order, and we dont have to make use of the picard-fuchs equations.
as we will see, the connection of su (n ), n = 2 super yangmills theory with
todawhitham hierarchies embodies in a natural way a recursive procedure to com-
pute all instanton corrections. the essential ingredient that makes this possible is

the relation of the derivatives of the prepotential with the theta function associated
to the root lattice of the gauge group. to see how this works, consider the instanton
expansion of the prepotential:

in this expression, p~+ denotes a sum over positive roots. the expansion is in

powers of , where  = 2n for su (n ), and k is the instanton number. we then
have

the derivative of the quadratic casimir has also an expansion that can be obtained
from the rg equation and (6.2):

where cij is the cartan matrix, fk,i = fk/ai , and we have taken into account

reections. in the above expression, we have used the characteristic (4.13), which
is the appropriate one if we are working in the electric frame, as we should do in
the semiclassical region. if we insert the expressions (6.5) and (6.8) into (6.4), and
we equate the coecients of the dierent powers of , we nd a set of recursive
equations for fk which make possible to compute all the instanton coecients by
starting from the perturbative contribution to the prepotential. for example, one
nds for the one-instanton correction:

of the procedure. we then see that, with this method, one can nd the instan-
ton corrections to the prepotential in a very simple way. the explicit expressions
(6.9)(6.10) are in full agreement with the results of 37), 39), 41) (see 18) for a detailed
presentation). this agreement gives a further check of the rg equation (3.11) and
of the choice of the characteristic (4.13).

these results on the instanton corrections can be extended in many ways. the
equation (3.11) can be also used to study the strong coupling regime near the points
of maximal singularity 42). moreover, one can analyze with this technique all the
classical groups with or without matter content to nd general expressions for the
instanton corrections 44).

7. conclusions and outlook

we have seen that the approach to the n = 2 prepotential based on the theory
of whitham hierarchies gives a very useful framework to understand deformations of
n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories. these deformations arise in dierent physical
contexts. we have explored in detail the structure of the contact terms in the twisted
version of n = 2 theories, and also the nonsupersymmetric deformations associated
to soft supersymmetry breaking. in both cases, the approach based on whitham
hierarchies provides the right conceptual framework and the technical tools to derive
the precise form of the deformed theory. we have also seen that one can obtain the
instanton expansion in the semiclassical region by using the equations for the rst
and second derivatives of the prepotential with respect to the quantum scale.

nevertheless, there are many issues that should be further claried. the frame-
work of whitham hierarchies should be generalized to other gauge groups and matter
content. some steps in this direction can be found in 43), 44), 45). in the context of

the twisted theory, one would like to introduce slow times associated to any homo-
geneous combination of the casimirs, and construct a prepotential depending on
these slow times and with the right semiclassical behavior. in this sense, although
the explicit construction given in 17) has claried the theory of the prepotential and
its applications to donaldson theory, one should be able to improve it along the
lines that we have suggested. it would be also nice to have an a priori connection
between the whitham hierarchy approach to the prepotential, and the structure of
the generating function for the twisted theory. we have followed a rather indirect
approach, based on a set of constraints for the contact terms and the rg equations.
the approach of 15), based on hamiltonian deformations of the prepotential, should
be useful in deriving this connection.

it would be also very interesting to nd an explicit construction of the polyno-
mials appearing in (4.8) for the higher rank case. as we have suggested, this con-
struction will involve interesting generalizations of sigma functions for hyperelliptic
curves. another reason for addressing this issue is that the structure of the blowup
formula gives a very direct connection between the toda hierarchy underlying the
seiberg-witten solution, and the generalizations of donaldson theory. this relation
is certainly intriguing and suggests that many structures that have been found in
two-dimensional topological gravity and two-dimensional topological matter could
be also relevant in four dimensions.
