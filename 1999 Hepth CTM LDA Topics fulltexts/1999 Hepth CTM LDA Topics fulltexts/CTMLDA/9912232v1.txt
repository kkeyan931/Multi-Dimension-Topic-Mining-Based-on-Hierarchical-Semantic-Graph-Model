abstract

we study two issues, the localization of various spin elds, and the problem of
the cosmological constant on a brane in ve-dimensional anti de sitter space. we
nd that spin-zero elds are localized on a positive-tension brane. in addition to
the localized zero-mode there is a continuous tower of states with no mass gap. spin
one-half and three-half states can be localized on a brane with negative tension.
their localization can be achieved on the positive-tension brane as well, if additional
interactions are introduced. the necessary ingredient of the scenario with localized
gravity is the relation between the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension.
in the absence of supersymmetry this implies ne-tuning between the parameters
of the theory. to deal with this issue we introduce a four-form gauge eld. this
gives an additional arbitrary contribution to the bulk cosmological constant. as a
result, the model gives rise to a continuous family of brane universe solutions for
generic values of the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension. among
these solutions there is one with a zero four-dimensional cosmological constant.

1 introduction and results

large extra dimensions oer an opportunity for a new solution to the hierarchy
problem [1]. the crucial ingredient of this scenario is a brane on which standard
model particles are localized. field-theoretic localization mechanisms for scalars
and fermions [2] as well as for gauge bosons [3] were found. in string theory, elds
can naturally be localized on d-branes due to the open strings ending on them [4].
up until recently, extra dimensions had to be compactied, since the localization
mechanism for gravity was not known. it was suggested in ref. [5] that gravitational
interactions between particles on a brane in uncompactied ve-dimensional space
could have the correct four-dimensional newtonian behavior, provided that the bulk
cosmological constant and the brane tension are related. recently, it was found by
randall and sundrum that gravitons can be localized on a brane which separates two
patches of ads5 space-time [6]. the necessary requirement for the four-dimensional
brane universe to be static is that the tension of the brane is ne-tuned to the
bulk cosmological constant [5, 6]. the generalization of this framework to higher
dimensions [7, 8, 9, 10], as well as a number of interesting phenomenological and
cosmological issues were studied in the literature [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].

as we mentioned above, there is a localized graviton zero-mode on the brane
worldvolume [6]. in addition, there is a continuum of graviton states in the brane
background [6]. all the elds in anti de sitter space2 should be given boundary
conditions. this can be accomplished by adopting the holographic approach to the
problem [18]. in this framework, the bulk continuum is described by a certain field
theory on the brane3. this eld theory should be coupled to a four-dimensional
graviton which is nothing but the localized graviton zero-mode in the original ads5
picture.
in a sense, the introduction of the brane generates the coupling of the
brane (boundary) four-dimensional eld theory (which is expected to describe the
bulk gravitational physics in accordance with the maldacena conjecture [19, 20, 21]),
to the four-dimensional einstein gravity. this framework sets uniquely the boundary
conditions for the elds (see, e.g., detailed discussions and the list of references in
[20]).

the aim of the present paper is to study localization of spin- 0, 1, 1/2 and 3/2
elds on a 3-brane in the ads5 space. the study of these issues is crucial for
phenomenological model-building as well as for the holographic description of the
model. besides, this can be useful for the task of realizing this scenario in the
supergravity framework.

another, seemingly dierent, but in fact closely related subject which we will
discuss here is the problem of the four-dimensional cosmological constant. we will

2 field theory in anti de sitter space needs careful treatment [17]. in general, there are closed
timelike curves in this space which can be avoided by considering the universal cover of ads space
[17]. in the present work, we will adopt the simplied terminology calling the covering space ads.
3this, in fact, should be conformal field theory since the isometry group of ads5 (which is

so(2, 4)) coincides with the conformal group of the brane (boundary) minkowski space.

argue that the necessity of the ne-tuning between the bulk cosmological constant
and the brane tension can be avoided by introducing a four-form gauge eld in the
theory.

in section 2 we study localization of various spin elds on a brane in ads5 space.
we consider two dierent cases: a positive tension brane which localizes gravity
[6] (the randall-sundrum (rs) brane) and a negative-tension brane which gives
rise to the exponentially growing warp factor [5]. we show that a spin-0 massless
eld is localized on the rs brane. the emerging picture is similar to that of the
localized graviton. there is a scalar zero-mode on the brane. in addition, there is a
continuum of states with no mass gap. this ts well into the holographic approach
mentioned above. furthermore, we show that the negative tension brane with
the exponentially rising warp factor does not allow to localize normalizable scalar
zero-modes.

for spin-1 elds the conclusions are less promising. neither the positive-tension
nor the negative-tension branes are capable of localizing vector elds in the min-
imal setup. the way out for the phenomenological model-building would be to
invoke either stringy mechanism of localization on a d-brane worldvolume, or, in
the eld theory framework, to use the dvali-shifman mechanism which is based on
the bulk connement [3]. in either case the introduction of new bulk physics is neces-
sary. furthermore, we show that in the minimal setup neither spin-1/2 not spin-3/2
fermions are localized on the rs brane. nevertheless, the localization of these elds
can be achieved by introducing new interactions in the theory. this allows one to
have localized chiral fermions on a brane. on the other hand, spin-1/2 and spin-
3/2 fermions are localized by gravitational interactions on a brane with negative
tension which has the exponentially rising warp factor. a peculiar feature of this
mechanism is that the localized modes are not chiral.

in section 3 we discuss the fate of the four-dimensional cosmological constant. as
we mentioned above, the scenarios of refs. [5, 6] require a special ne-tuned relation
of the bulk cosmological constant to the brane tension. once this relation is enforced,
the four-dimensional brane universe is static, i.e., the four-dimensional cosmological
constant is zero. within the supergravity framework this relation is just the bps
condition [22]. however, one should not expect that the bps relation survives the
quantum corrections after susy breaking. as a result, one eventually goes back to
ne-tuning. we will show in section 3 that the necessity of the ne-tuning can be
removed from the theory. this is accomplished by introducing a four-form gauge
eld which couples to gravity only. the four-form eld does not propagate physical
degrees of freedom in ve-dimensional space, however, it can give rise to an arbitrary
(negative or positive depending on the sign of its kinetic term) cosmological constant
in the theory [23, 24]. therefore, for any value of the original bulk cosmological
constant, the net cosmological constant in this model is arbitrary. as a result, there
are innite number of brane universe solutions. each of these brane universes is
labeled by the corresponding four-dimensional cosmological constant. among all
these possible brane universes there is one with a zero cosmological constant. this

3

removes the ne-tuning problem from the randall-sundrum scenario in the sense
that a static solution now exists for any value of the bulk cosmological constant and
the brane tension. in addition, this framework opens an opportunity for anthropic
arguments.

2 localization via warp factors

we start with the ve-dimensional gravity action and a cosmological constant (the
[+,,,,] signature will be assumed below)

in addition one includes a static 3-brane with tension t which is located at y = 0
[6]. the ve-dimensional interval will be parametrized as follows:

s = m 3 z d5x (r + 2) .

ds2 = a(y) dx2

3+1  dy2 .

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

the einstein equations in this case have two dierent solutions for the warp factor
a(y). for a positive-tension brane one nds [6]

while for a negative-tension brane the warp factor is exponentially rising4 [5]

a(y) = exp (h|y|) ,

a(y) = exp (h|y|) .

in both cases, the static solutions (3) and (4) exist if the bulk cosmological constant
is ne-tuned to the brane tension

(5)

we will show below, that the rs solution admits the localization of a spin-0 state
in addition to the already known localization of gravitons. the solution (4), on the
other hand, localizes spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 fermions.

before we go further, let us make some comments on the literature. one can
consider an orbifold compactication of the fth dimension in the rs framework.
in this case, there are two 3-branes which are located at the orbifold xed points
[6]. one of these is a positive-tension brane and the other one is a negative-tension
brane. the warp factor for one of them decreases as in (3), while for the other one
it increases exponentially (4). therefore, in this framework spin-0 and spin-2 states
will be localized on the positive-tension brane, while spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 states
will be trapped on the negative-tension one.
in what follow we will be studying
a single 3-brane which separates two patches of ads5 space-time. from the point
of view of the orbifold construction this corresponds to the case when one of the
orbifold xed points is removed to innity.

4the negative-tension brane is understood as a non-dynamical slice of space with negative
[25] in a

energy density. the exponentially rising warp factor was originally introduced in ref.
theory with no branes.

2.1 spin-0 elds

in this subsection we study the localization of a real scalar eld in the background
(2). we will nd that the solution (3) admits a localized zero-mode.

let us start with a massless scalar eld coupled to gravity:

1

2 z d5xggabab .

(6)

here a, b denote ve-dimensional indices. the corresponding equation of motion
takes the form

a(cid:16)ggabb(cid:17) = 0 .

using (2) and decomposing this equation in the four-dimensional and fth dimen-
sional parts one nds:

(7)

(8)

(9)

 
let us decompose the eld  as follows:

1
a

1

a2 y(cid:16)a2y(cid:17) = 0 .

(x, y) = (x) (y).

a plane wave which propagates in a four-dimensional worldvolume satises the cor-
responding four-dimensional equation of motion:

using this, and introducing a new variable

(x) = m2(x) .

u(y) = a(y) (y) ,

one gets the following schrodinger equation for the y-dependent part:

h2

y  m2 eh|y| + h 2  2h(y)i u(y) = 0 .

(10)

(11)

(12)

this equation coincides with the one for a localized graviton [6]. the zero-mass
solution (m2 = 0) to this equation takes the form:

u(y) = c eh|y| ,

(13)

where c is a constant. it is interesting that, written in terms of the original variable
, the scalar zero-mode is just a constant

(y) = c .

(14)

at a rst glance, such a solution could not be localized since it is not suppressed
away from the brane. nevertheless, the solution can still be considered as a localized

5

mode. the presence of the exponential warp factor in the metric (2) allows one to
perform the following decomposition for the zero-mode

1

2 z d4xdyg gab a0 b0 =

2 z +



dyg2(y)gz d4x(x)(x)
2 z d4x (x)(x) ,

=

1

(15)

where we set c = qh/2.

thus, for the zero-mode 0(x, y) = qh/2 (x). moreover, the eld (x) is

eectively localized on a brane worldvolume due to the exponentially decreasing
warp factor. notice that this zero-mode resembles a zero-mode of the standard
kaluza-klein compactication. this is not surprising since the eective size of the
fth dimension, l, is nite, l  1/h, in spite of the fact that this dimension is not
compact [7]. let us stress also that such a constant localized solution is possible
only for the warp factor (3), but not for (4).

as in the case of gravitons [6], the equation (12) gives rise to a tower of continuum
states with m2 > 0. these states produce a nonzero contribution of order 1/r3 to
the usual four-dimensional 1/r potential mediated by a massless scalar exchange on
a brane. the picture is similar to that of the localized graviton [6].

2.2 spin-1 elds

there are no localized solutions in this case. although there is a constant solution
similar to (14), nevertheless, the lagrangian for a vector eld does not yield the
suppressing warp factor which was so crucial in the case of scalars. let us see this
in some details. using the denition of the 5d eld-strength

fab = avb  bva ,

(16)

choosing the gauge v5 = 0, and decomposing the remaining part of the massless
vector eld as

v(x, y) = v(x)(y) ,

(17)

1

we get (f  v  v)
4 z d4xdyg gab gcd fac fbd =

this diverges if (y) is a constant.

how about nontrivial solutions to the equation of motion for the vector eld,
could they give localized solutions? one can check that such normalizable solutions
do not exist. since this issue has already been studied in the orbifold version of the
rs scenario in [26, 27] we skip these derivations. the net result is that neither (3)
nor (4) localizes massless vector elds.

6

2.3 spin-1/2 fermions

we start with the lagrangian for massless spin-1/2 fermions

ig bdb .

(19)

the corresponding equation of motion can be decomposed as follows:

(cid:16) d + 5 d5(cid:17) (x, y) = 0 .
the relations between the curved-space gamma matrices ({a, b} = 2gab) and
the minkowskian ones ({a, b} = 2ab) read as follows:

(20)

 =

 , 5 = 5 .

(21)

the spin-connection and covariant derivative can also be calculated for the metric
(2):

d =  +

5 , d5 = 5 .

(22)

a
4a

after these conventions are set we can decompose the ve-dimensional spinor into
the four-dimensional and the fth-dimensional parts: (x, y) = (x)(y). we
require that the four-dimensional part satises the massless equation of motion
(x) = 0. as a result, we obtain the following equation for the y dependent
part

 y +

the solution to this equation reads:

a

a! (y) = 0 .

(23)

(24)

(y) =

c

a(y)

.

this is not normalizable in the rs case (3), but it is normalizable if the warp factor
(4) is used. to see this, one has to decompose the action (19) as follows:

z d4xz +
z +

dyg (x, y)ibdb(x, y) =
dya3/2(y)2(y)z d4x (x)i(x) ,





which is innite for a(y) dened in (3), but is nite for a(y) from (4) (we choose
c = h/2 to get the correct normalization)5.

in order to localize spin-1/2 fermions in the rs framework one could use the
method of localization due to jackiw and rebbi [29]. for this, one introduces the

5after we obtained these results the work [28] appeared, in which it was shown that in the

orbifold rs construction massless spin- 1/2 elds are not localized on a brane.

7

interaction of fermions with a scalar eld,  . the scalar should interpolate
between two dierent vacua at dierent sides of the brane (one could take the kink
solution, for instance). this gives an eective ve-dimensional mass to fermions
(constant fermion mass approximation is good enough when the scalar is heavy).
however, the ve-dimensional fermion mass term m  would ip the sign under
the reection with respect to the brane. under these circumstances, the chiral
left(right)-handed component of the fermion can be localized on the brane [29]. the
equation of motion for the fermion takes the form:

 y +

a
a

+ i5m [(y)  (y)] ! (x, y) = 0 ,

(25)

where (y) is the step-function. introducing the chiral modes as i5l,r = l,r,
one nds that the chiral solution l  exp(h  m) is localized for (3) as long as:

m >

h
4

.

(26)

likewise, in the background (4), the mode l is localized if m < h/4.

2.4 spin-3/2 fermions

the consideration for gravitinos is similar to that of spin-1/2 fermions. therefore,
our discussions will be brief. the equation of motion for a massless gravitino reads
as:

[abc] db c = 0 .

(27)

here, the square brackets denote antisymmetrization w.r.t. all indices. we choose
the gauge 5 = 0 and split the remaining elds as (x, y) = (x) u(y). using
now the four-dimensional gauge choice  =  = 0, and the four-dimensional
equation of motion for a massless spin-3/2 eld [] = 0, one nds the
following equation for the y dependent part:

 y +

a

2a! u(y) = 0 .

the solution to this equation is

u(y) =

c

.

qa(y)

in the rs case this is not a normalizable function. the action

(30)

diverges because of the y integration. on the other hand, for the exponentially rising
warp factor (4), the y integral is nite and the 4d action is canonically normalized
for c = h/2. therefore, the solution (4) admits a localized free spin-3/2 zero-mode
on the 3-brane. notice that this mode is not chiral.

finally, let us comment on a possibility of localization of gravitinos on the back-
ground (3). one should introduce some additional interactions for this to happen
(as we did for the case of spin-1/2 elds). the simplest way would be to realize
the rs solution (3) in n = 2 ve-dimensional supergravity. in this case, one could
hope to nd a bps 3-brane which preserves half of the original supersymmetries.
since the background (3) localizes gravitons, by supersymmetry, its sugra coun-
terpart should also localize gravitinos. the dynamical reason for the localization
of gravitinos could be their interactions with some other elds of the corresponding
sugra. one could think of scalars, as candidates for this, in the ve-dimensional
gauged supergravity. detailed studies of these issues could be a subject of a separate
project.

3 cosmological constant on a brane

in this section we study what happens if the bulk cosmological constant is not ne-
tuned to its critical value which is dened by eq. (5)6. this is expected to be the
generic case in any realistic brane universe models with broken susy. indeed, after
susy is broken, equation (5) can no longer be protected against corrections even
though it could have been obtained as a bps equation in some ve-dimensional the-
ory of supergravity ( along the lines of [22], for instance). therefore, in what follows
we consider the case when the bulk cosmological constant diers from its critical
value dened by (5).
in such a case the four-dimensional brane universe is not
static any more [30, 31]. the four-dimensional cosmological constant is determined
by the dierence between the actual bulk cosmological constant and the critical cos-
mological constant satisfying (5). generically, this dierence can be big, leading to
a de sitter or anti de sitter four-dimensional brane universe with an unacceptably
large four-dimensional cosmological constant. thus, it seems that the ne-tuning
is of vital importance. however, the ne-tuning of the parameters can be avoided
by introducing into the theory a four-form gauge eld abcde. this eld cannot
propagate any physical degrees of freedom in ve-dimensions. nevertheless, it gives
rise to a dynamically generated cosmological constant [23, 24]. the value of this
cosmological constant is arbitrary, since it appears as a constant of integration of the
equation of motion for the abcde eld. therefore, the net cosmological constant
in ve-dimensions is the sum of the original cosmological constant and the dynami-
cally generated one7. let us for simplicity assume that the original bulk cosmological

constant  is positive but otherwise an arbitrary number which is not necessarily
ne-tuned to the brane tension (the generalization for negative  is straightforward
and will be given in the next section). the action for the system can be written as
follows:

s = m 3z d5xg (r + 2) +z d5xg(cid:26)

fabcdef abcde(cid:27) + sbrane .

(31)
here fabcde denotes the gauge-invariant eld-strength for the eld abcde (the
choice of the sign of the kinetic term for this eld will be discussed in the next
section). the action for the brane itself in (31) is denoted by sbrane. we will simply
assume that the 3-brane is a static source which is localized at y = 0. it has the
following energy-momentum tensor:

t brane
ab = t (y) diag(1,1,1,1, 0) ,

where t denotes the tension of the 3-brane.

the equations of motion of the system take the following form:

(32)

(33)

(34)

as we discussed above, the crucial property of the four-form gauge eld in ve-
dimensional space-time is that it does not propagate dynamical degrees of freedom.
the whole dynamics is eliminated by the system of equations of motion, and the
gauge constraints which emerge as a result of the gauge invariance of the action.
nevertheless, this system of equations has a constant eld-strength solution which
gives rise to a nonzero vacuum energy density. this is what happens in general with
a d-form gauge invariant eld-strength in d-dimensional space-time.

to make these discussions quantitative let us look for the following solution to

the equations of motion (33):

ds2 = a(y)(cid:16) dt2  a(t) dxidxi (cid:17)  dy2 ,

(35)

where a(t) is the scale factor of the four-dimensional brane universe. the corre-
sponding background for the four-form eld is given by

in the next section.

f abcde =

abcde k ,

(36)

where k stands for an arbitrary integration constant (in our normalizations 12345 =
1). with this ansatz at hand the four-dimensional components of the energy-
momentum tensor for the four-form eld take the form:

tab =

(42)

let us summarize the results of our discussions. the system (31) without the f
eld does not allow for a static solution for a generic, non-ne-tuned values of
the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension. however, when the f eld
is switched on, there are an innite number of brane universe solutions. these
universes dier from each other by the value of the corresponding four-dimensional
cosmological constants dened in (42). among these solutions there is the static
brane with zero four-dimensional cosmological constant. this removes the necessity
of the ne-tuning in the sense that static solution now exists for any values of
 and t . certainly, the cosmological constant problem is not solved, instead, the
introduction of the f eld gives an opportunity for the anthropic arguments. indeed,

only those branes for which the four-dimensional cosmological constant ts into the
weinbergs window [32]:

,

(43)

could accommodate the universe similar to ours. all other brane universes, not
satisfying (43), would not be able to form the large scale structures. concluding,
the action (31) allows to avoid the necessity of ne-tuning of the bulk cosmological
constant  to the brane tension t . as we have shown, for any  and t there are
an innite number of possible brane universe solutions of (31) and one of these
solutions has zero four-dimensional cosmological constant.

4 discussions and conclusions

let us start with some comments on the form of the action (31). the four-form
eld in (31) reminds the ramond-ramond (rr) eld to which a three-brane could
couple. however, one can check that the sign of the kinetic term in (31) is inverse to
what should have been used for the rr eld. the choice of this sign is not restricted
by positivity arguments in the ve-dimensional theory (31), since this eld does not
propagate dynamical degrees of freedom. however, the negative sign is necessary in
(31) if the four-form eld is real and one needs to generate a negative cosmological
constant in (38). this is true as long as the original cosmological constant  in
(31) is an arbitrary positive number. thus, for  > 0 the four-form eld cannot
be thought of as a rr eld. let as now see what happens if  is a big arbitrary
negative number (in fact, without loss of generality, we take its magnitude to be
bigger than the magnitude of the critical value dened by (5)). in this case one can
just ip the sign of the kinetic term of the f 2 term in (31) and obtain the desired
result8.
indeed, in this case, the kinetic term for the four-form eld is precisely
equivalent to that for a rr eld. this produces a positive cosmological constant in
the bulk. therefore, the expression (42) takes the form:

4 =

t 2
36m 6 +

2

3 (cid:18)  +

1

4m 3 k2 (cid:19) .

(44)

since  in this case is a big negative number (its magnitude is bigger than t 2/24m 6),
one is still able to have an innite number of brane universe solutions parametrized
by the integration constant k and one of these solutions have 4 = 0. in this case
(negative ), one could think of the four-form eld as some kind of rr eld of
string theory. however, in our case the brane at hand should not couple to this rr
eld, i.e., the brane should not be a d-brane. otherwise, the eective cosmological
constant produced by the rr eld would be dened by the brane rr charge. since

8 alternatively, one could add to the action (31) another four-form eld with opposite kinetic

term.

this is quantized, one would again need ne-tuning between the brane charge and the
brane tension (as before, in the supergravity framework this is the bps condition,
however it becomes ne-tuning after susy is broken).

let us now go back to the case  > 0 considered in the previous section. a way
to think of the four-form eld in this case is to recall that in theories of supergravity
there are auxiliary scalar elds. these scalars usually enter an o-shell lagrangian
in a quadratic form without kinetic terms. one of these scalars, let us call it ,
can be dualized into the ve-form eld strength via   abcdef abcde. since the
original scalar was an auxiliary eld and the four-form does not propagate dynamical
degrees of freedom either, this dualization makes sense. as a result, the 2 term in
the original o-shell lagrangian of supergravity, which can emerge as g(r + 2)
[33], is replaced by the f 2 term in the form given in (31). this is acceptable as
far as bosonic modes are concerned. the actual issue is whether it is possible to
perform the dualization of the whole sugra supermultiplet, not only its scalar
part. such a dualization of the chiral n = 1 sugra supermultiplet into the tensor
supermultiplet was shown to be possible in the four-dimensional case [34]. the issue
whether the same can be done in ve-dimensions remains open.

to conclude, we studied localization of various spin elds on a brane in ads5.
we found that spin-0 elds are localized on a brane with positive tension which
also localizes gravitons. the spectrum of spin-0 eld is similar to that of the lo-
calized graviton: there is a single localized zero-mode plus a continuous tower of
states. this continuum can be thought of as a bulk ve-dimensional eld. to
x the boundary conditions, the whole picture should be viewed in a sense of the
ads/cft correspondence. spin-1 elds are not localized neither on a brane with
positive tension nor on a brane with negative tension. within the eld theory
framework the dvali-shifman mechanism [3] should be invoked for the vector eld
localization. in string theory, vector elds could be localized by assuming that the
brane at hand is in fact a d-brane. spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 elds are localized due to
gravitational interactions on a brane with negative tension. the localized modes
in this case are not chiral. in order to trap spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 chiral zero-modes
on a positive-tension brane additional elds should be introduced. these could be
scalars of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity.

finally, we have shown that ne-tuning between the bulk cosmological constant
and the brane tension can be avoided if there is a four-form gauge eld in the
theory. this eld gives rise to an additional contribution to the bulk cosmological
constant. as a result, the model with any generic  and t supports an innite
number of brane universe solutions which are parametrized by the continuous family
of four-dimensional cosmological constants. among these solutions there is one with
4 = 0.
