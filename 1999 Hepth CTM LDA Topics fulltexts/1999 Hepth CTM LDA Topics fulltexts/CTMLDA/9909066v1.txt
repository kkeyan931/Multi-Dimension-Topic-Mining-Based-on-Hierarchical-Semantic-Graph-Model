abstract

we review recent results on the derivation of a global path integral density for yang-mills
theory. based on a generalization of the stochastic quantization scheme and its geometrical
interpretation we rst recall how locally a modied faddeev-popov path integral density for
the quantization of yang-mills theory can be derived, the modication consisting in the presence
of specic f inite contributions of the pure gauge degrees of freedom. due to the gribov problem
the gauge xing can be dened only locally and the whole space of gauge potentials has to be
partitioned into patches. we discuss a global extension of the path integral by summing over
all patches, which can be proven to be manifestly independent of the specic local choices of
patches and gauge xing conditions, respectively. in addition to the formulation on the whole
space of gauge potentials we discuss the corresponding path integral on the gauge orbit space.

the faddeev-popov [1] path integral procedure constitutes one of the most popular

quantization methods for yang-mills theory and is widely used in elementary particle

physics. it is, however, well known that at a non perturbative level due to the gribov

ambiguity [2] a unique gauge xing in the full space of gauge elds is not possible so that

the faddeev-popov path integral procedure is dened only locally in eld space.

several attempts were presented to generalize the above approach in order to establish

global integral representations [3, 4] in the space of gauge elds. it is our aim to present

a quite dierent argumentation based on a recently introduced generalized stochastic

quantization scheme [5, 6, 7, 8].

the stochastic quantization method of parisi and wu [9] was introduced 1981 as a new

method for quantizing eld theories. it is based on concepts of nonequilibrium statistical

mechanics and provides novel and alternative insights into quantum eld theory, see

refs. [10, 11]. one of the most interesting aspects of this new quantization scheme lies

in its rather unconventional treatment of gauge eld theories, in specic of yang-mills

theories. we just recall that originally it was formulated by parisi and wu without the

introduction of gauge xing terms and the usual faddeev-popov ghost elds; later on

a modied approach named stochastic gauge xing was given by zwanziger [12] where

again no faddeev-popov ghost elds where introduced. our focus is based on extending

zwanzigers stochastic gauge xing scheme. by this generalized stochastic gauge xing

scheme it is possible to derive a non perturbative proof of the equivalence between the

conventional path integral formulation of this model and the equilibrium limit of the

corresponding stochastic correlation functions.

the main diculty in the previous investigations of the stochastic quantization of

yangmills theory for deriving a conventional eld theory path integral density was to

solve the fokkerplanck equation in the equilibrium limit. in the original parisiwu ap-

proach this equilibrium limit could not even be attained due to unbounded diusions of

the gauge modes. zwanziger [12, 13] suggested to introduce a specic additional nonholo-

nomic stochastic force term to suppress these gauge modes yet keeping the expectation

values of gauge invariant observables unchanged. the approach to equilibrium and the

2

discussion of the conditions of applicability to the nonperturbative regime, however, do

not seem to have been fully completed.

our analysis is distinguished by the above approaches by exploiting a more general

freedom to modify both the drift term and the diusion term of the stochastic pro-

cess again leaving all expectation values of gauge invariant variables unchanged. due to

this additional structure of modication the equilibrium limit can be obtained immedi-

ately using the uctuation dissipation theorem proving equivalence with the well known

faddeev-popov path integral density. in deriving this result the gauge degrees of freedom

are fully under control, no innite gauge group volumes arise. however, this equivalence

proof can be performed only locally in eld space for gauge eld congurations satisfying

a unique gauge xing condition and deserves an extension for global applicability. we are

able to discuss such a formulation in the second half of this paper.

let p (m, g) be a principal ber bundle with compact structure group g over the
compact euclidean space time m. let a denote the space of all irreducible connections
on p and let g denote the gauge group, which is given by all vertical automorphisms on
p reduced by the centre of g. then g acts freely on a and denes a principal g-bration
a  a/g =: m over the paracompact [14] space m of all inequivalent gauge potentials
with projection . due to the gribov ambiguity the principal g-bundle a  m is not
globally trivializable.

using this mathematical setting we start with the parisiwu approach for the stochas-

tic quantization of the yangmills theory in terms of the langevin equation

da = 

s
a

ds + dw.

(1)

here s denotes the yangmills action without gauge symmetry breaking terms and with-

out accompanying ghost eld terms, s denotes the extra time coordinate (stochastic

time coordinate) with respect to which the stochastic process is evolving, dw is the

increment of a wiener process.

we now discuss zwanzigers modied formulation of the parisi-wu scheme: the

stochastic gauge xing procedure consists in adding an additional drift force to the

3

langevin equation (1) which acts tangentially to the gauge orbits. this additional term

generally can be expressed by the gauge generator da, i.e. the covariant derivative with

respect to a, and an arbitrary function a so that the modied langevin equation reads

as follows

da ="

s
a

+ daa# ds + dw.

(2)

the expectation values of gauge invariant observables remain unchanged for any choice of

the function a . for specic choices of the  in principle  arbitrary function a the gauge

modes diusion is damped along the gauge orbits. as a consequence the fokker-planck

density can be normalized; we remind that this situation is dierent to the parisi- wu

approach, where for expectation values of gauge variant observables no equilibrium values

could be attained.

in contrast to the approach of [12] where no equilibrium distribution of the fokker

planck equation could be derived as well as in contrast to [13] where the full fokker

planck operator

l =



a" s

a  daa +



a#

(3)

was needed to obtain an equilibrium distribution we present a quite dierent strategy:

as the fokker-planck operator factorizes into rst order dierential operators the

question arises whether it is possible to derive the equilibrium distribution directly by

solving a simpler rst order problem. however, for this to be possible a necessary integra-
s
a  daa has to be fullled. it is well known

bility condition imposed on the drift term

that for the yangmills case this is violated.

in the following we want to clarify the relationship of this integrability condition and

the underlying geometrical structure of the space of gauge potentials. we remind that

any bundle metric on a principal ber bundle which is invariant under the corresponding

group action gives rise to a natural connection whose horizontal subbundle is orthogonal

to the corresponding group. in the yang-mills theory case with respect to the natural
metric on a this connection is given by the following lieg valued one form

 = 1

a d
a.

(4)

4

here d

a is the adjoint operator of the covariant derivative da, 1

a is the inverse of the

covariant laplacian a = d

ada.

the curvature  of ,  = a + 1

2[, ], where a denotes the exterior derivative on
a, however, does not vanish so that there does not exist (even locally) a manifold whose
tangent bundle is isomorphic to this horizontal subbundle. moreover this also implies

that any vector eld along the gauge group cannot be written as a gradient of a function.

it is our intention to modify the stochastic process (1) for the yangmills theory in

such a way that the factorization of the modied fokker-planck operator indeed allows

the determination of the equilibrium distribution as a solution of a rst order dierential

equation in a consistent manner.

from [14] it follows that there exists a locally nite open cover u = {u} of m

together with a set of background gauge elds {a()

 = {b  1(u)|d

a()

0

0  a} such that
(b  a()

0 ) = 0}

(5)

denes a family of local sections of a  m. instead of analyzing yang-mills theory in the
original eld space a we consider the familiy of trivial principal g-bundles  g  ,
which are locally isomorphic to the bundle a  m, where the isomorphisms are provided
by the maps

 :   g  1(u),

(b, g) := bg

(6)

with b  , g  g and bg denoting the gauge transformation of b by g. thus we

transform the parisiwu langevin equation (1) into the adapted coordinates  =

as this transformation is not globally possible the region of denition of (1) has to be
restricted to 1(u(a()

0 )). making use of the ito stochastic calculus the above langevin

to the change of coordinates a  (b, g), the induced metric g, its inverse and its

the above langevin equation is the most general langevin equation for yangmills

theory which leads to the same expectation values of gauge invariant variables as the

original parisiwu equation (1): an easy way to prove this assertion is to observe that

the a and b dependent terms in the modied langevin equation (9) drop out after

projecting on the gauge invariant subspace  described by the coordinate b.

transforming back the langevin equation (9) into the original coordinates a not

only zwanzigers original term daa is appearing, but also an additional b-dependent

drift term as well as a specic modication of the wiener increment, described by the

operator be = 1 + dab. the idea is to view be as a vielbein giving rise to the inverse of
a metric bg on the space 1(u(a()
0 )). since any of the bg (parametrized by the not yet

specied b) implies a specic connection one is likely to arrive at an analogous obstruction

as mentioned above. it is therefore necessary to require that the corresponding curvature

namely the pull-back of the maurercartan form  = ad(g1)rg on the gauge group via
the local trivialization of the bundle 1(u(a()

should vanish. indeed, we know that locally there exists a at connectione in our bundle
0 ). explicitely e is given by

0 ))  u(a()

(10)

the associated horizontal subbundle fh is built by all those vectors in the tangent space
in a  1(u(a()
and b is a tangent vector of  in point b. the fact that the curvature corresponding

0 )) which can be written in the form  = ad(g1)b, where a = bg

to the connection e is vanishing implies that the horizontal subbundle fh is integrable.
the connection e cannot be extended to a globally dened at connection on the whole
bundle a  m, however, due to its nontriviality.
we determine the value of b by xing the metric bg in such a way that e is exactly
the induced connection imposed by itself. this implies that the horizontal subbundle fh
is orthogonal to the gauge orbits with respect to the metric bg and -in this sense- the gauge

xing surface is orthogonal to the gauge orbits.

the determination of a can in fact be given a suggestive meaning, too: we have the

freedom to totally exchange the drift term of the g-eld component of the langevin

due to these choices for a and b we rstly obtain a well damped langevin equation for

due to the positivity of eg the uctuation dissipation theorem applies and the (non-

of the rst order dierential operator on the right hand side of the fokker-planck operator

(15)

(16)

as

 estot

 ,  =qdet g.

it is the basic idea of the stochastic quantization scheme to interpret an equilibrium limit

of a fokkerplanck distribution as euclidean path integral measure. although our above

result for the path integral measure implies unconventional f inite contributions along the

gauge group (arising from the pr

gsg term) it is equivalent to the usual faddeevpopov

prescription for yangmills theory. this follows from the fact that for expectation values

of gauge invariant observables these contributions along the gauge group are exactly

cancelled out due to the normalization of the path integral, see below. we stress once

more that due to the gribov ambiguity the usual faddeevpopov approach as well as

-presently- our modied version are valid only locally in eld space.

in order to compare expectation values on dierent patches we consider the dieo-

morphism in the overlap of two patches

12 : (1  1(u2))  g  (2  1(u1))  g

12(b, g) := (b2 (b)1

, g).

(17)
here 2 : 1(u2)  g is uniquely dened by a2 (a)1  2. to the density 
there is associated a corresponding twisted top form on   g (see e.g. [15]) which for
simplicity we denote by the same symbol. using for convenience a matrix representation

of g [7] we straightforwardly verify that


12 2 = 1 .

(18)

8

this immediately implies that in overlap regions the expectation values of gauge invariant
observables f  c (a) are equal when evaluated in dierent patches

finally we propose the denition of the global expectation value of a gauge invariant
observable f  c (a) by summing over all the elements e of a partition of unity on m
(the existence of a partition of unity is guaranteed by the result of [14]) so that

hfi = p rg
p rg

 estot

 

(f e)

.

(19)

due to (18) it is trivial to prove that the global expectation value hfi is independent of
the specic choice of the locally nite cover {u}, of the choice of the background gauge
elds {a()

0 } and of the choice of the partition of unity e, respectively.

these structures can equally be translated into the original eld space a. with the
 can be pieced

help of the partion of unity the locally dened densities  as well as estot
together to give a globally well dened twisted top form  on a

( estot

 )e.

the global expectation value (19) then reads

(20)

(21)

hfi = ra  f
ra 

which due to the discussion from above is independent of all the particular local choices.

let us extract the gauge invariant part of the local fokkerplanck densities (16)

det f (det a()

)1/2 e

s.

(22)

by using (18) we can prove that their projections on m on overlapping sets of u are
agreeing so that they are giving rise to a globally well dened top form  on m. one can
furthermore show that the above expectation values of gauge invariant functions f can
identically be rewritten as corresponding integrals over the gauge orbit space m with
respect to 

.

(23)

hfi = rm

we note that this last expression shows agreement with the formulation proposed by
stora [3] upon identication of  with the ruelle-sullivan form [16].

whereas in [3] the global denition (23) of expectation values on m appeared as the
starting point for a path integral formulation of yang-mills theory in the whole space of

gauge potentials it appears now as our nal result; we aimed at its direct derivation within

the stochastic quantization approach: first we derived a local path integral measure on
g in terms of the probability density  estot
the gauge xing surface as well as along the gauge orbits. the inherent interrelation of
the eld variables on the patches  g subsequently led to simple relations of the local
densities in the overlap regions and eventually to the global path integral formulations

 which assured gaussian decrease along

(19), (21) and (23), respectively.
