responding to the recent claim that the origin of moduli space may be unstable in magnetic
supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics (sqcd) with nf  3nc/2 (nc > 2) for nf avors
and nc colors of quarks, we explore the possibility of nding nonperturbative physics for electric
sqcd. we present a recently discussed eective superpotential for electric sqcd with nc + 2 
nf  3nc/2 (nc > 2) that generates chiral symmetry breaking with a residual nonabelian symmetry
of su (nc)l+r  su (nf nc)l  su (nf nc)r. holomorphic decoupling property is shown to be
respected. for massive nf  nc quarks, our superpotential with instanton eect taken into account
produces a consistent vacuum structure for sqcd with nf = nc compatible with the holomorphic
decoupling.

it has been widely accepted that physics of n =1 supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics (sqcd) at strong
electric coupling is well described by the corresponding dynamics of sqcd at weak magnetic coupling [1,2]. this
dynamical feature is referred to as seibergs n =1 duality [3]. in order to apply the n =1 duality to the physics of
sqcd, one has to adjust dynamics of magnetic quarks so that the anomaly-matching conditions [4,5] are satised.
in sqcd with quarks carrying nf avors and nc colors for nf  nc+2, the n =1 duality is respected as long as
magnetic quarks have nf  nc colors [1,3]. appropriate interactions of magnetic quarks can be derived in sqcd
embedded in a softly broken n =2 sqcd [6,7] that possesses the manifest n =2 duality [8]. in sqcd with 3nc/2 <
nf < 3nc, its phase is characterized by an interacting coulomb phase [1], where the n =2 duality can be transmitted
to n =1 sqcd. on the other hand, in sqcd with nf  3nc/2, it is not clear that the n =1 duality is supported
by the similar description in terms of the n =2 duality although it is believed that the result for 3nc/2 < nf can be
safely extended to apply to this case.

lately, several arguments [911] have been made to discuss other possibilities than the physics based on the n =1
duality, especially for sqcd with nf  3nc/2. it is clamed in ref. [9] that the origin of moduli space becomes unstable
in magnetic sqcd and that the spontaneous breakdown of the vectorial su (nf )l+r symmetry is expected to occur.
an idea of an anomalous u (1) symmetry, u (1)anom, taken as a background gauge symmetry has been employed. their
ndings are essentially based on the analyses made in the slightly broken supersymmetric (susy) vacuum. on the
other hand, emphasizing nonperturbative implementation of u (1)anom, the authors of ref. [10] have derived a new
type of an eective superpotential applicable to electric sqcd. however, the physical consequences based on their
superpotential have not been claried yet. finally, extensive evaluation of formation of condensates has provided
a signal due to spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetries although there is a question on the reliability of their
dynamical gap equations [11]. these attempts suggest that, in order to make underlying property of sqcd more
transparent, it is helpful to employ a composite chiral supereld composed of chiral gauge superelds [1214] that is
responsible for relevant expression for u (1)anom.

in a recent article [16], we have discussed what physics is suggested by sqcd with nc + 2  nf  3nc/2 and
have found that, once sqcd triggers the formation of one condensate made of a quark-antiquark pair, the successive
formation of other condensates is dynamically induced to generate spontaneous breakdown of the chiral su (nf )
symmetry to su (nf  nc) as a residual chiral nonabelian symmetry. 1 the anomalies associated with original chiral

symmetries are matched with those from the nambu-goldstone superelds. as in ref. [9], our suggested dynamics
can also be made more visible by taking softly broken sqcd [17] in its supersymmetric limit. the derived eective
superpotential has the common structure to the one discussed in ref. [10]. it should be noted that the magnetic
description should be selected by sqcd if sqcd favors the formation of no condensates.

in this paper, we further study eects of susy-preserving masses. it is shown that our superpotential is equipped
with holomorphic decoupling property. in the case that quarks carrying avors of su (nf  nc) are massive, our
superpotential supplemented by instanton contributions correctly reproduces consistent vacuum structure with the
decoupling property.

in sqcd with nc + 2  nf  3nc/2 (nc > 2), our superpotential [16] takes the form of

we = s(cid:26)ln(cid:20) sncnf det (t ) f (z)

3ncnf

with an arbitrary function, f (z), to be determined, where  is the scale of sqcd. the composite superelds are

this superpotential is derived by requiring that not only it is invariant under su (nf )l  su (nf )r as well as under
two additional u (1) symmetries but also it is equipped with the transformation property under u (1)anom broken by
the instanton eect, namely, l  f  f , where l represents the lagrangian of sqcd and f  ( f  f )
is a gluons eld strength [12]. note that z is neutral under the entire chiral symmetries including u (1)anom and the
z-dependence of f (z) cannot be determined by the symmetry principle.

although the origin of the moduli space, where t = b = b = 0, is allowed by we , the consistent sqcd must
automatically show the anomaly-matching property with respect to unbroken chiral symmetries. since the anomaly-
matching property is not possessed by sqcd realized at t = b = b = 0, composite elds are expected to be
dynamically reshued so that the anomaly-matching becomes a dynamical consequence. usually, one accepts that
sqcd is described by magnetic degrees of freedom instead of t , b and b. however, it is equally possible to occur
that electric sqcd dynamically rearranges some of t , b and b to develop vacuum expectation values (vevs).
in this case, chiral symmetries are spontaneously broken and the presence of the anomalies can be ascribed to the
nambu-goldstone bosons for the broken sector and to chiral fermions for the unbroken sector [5]. if the consistent
sqcd with broken chiral symmetries is described by our superpotential, the anomaly-matching constraint must be
automatically satised and is indeed shown to be satised by the nambu-goldstone superelds. in the ordinary qcd
with two avors, we know the similar situation, where qcd with massless proton and neutron theoretically allows
the existence of the unbroken chiral su (2)l  su (2)r symmetry but real physics of qcd chooses its spontaneous
breakdown into su (2)l+r [4]. however, since the susy-invariant theory possesses any susy vacua, which cannot
be dynamically selected, both magnetic and electric vacua will correspond to a true vacuum of sqcd.

in the classical limit, where the sqcd gauge coupling g vanishes, the behavior of we is readily found by applying
the rescaling s  g2s and invoking the denition    exp(82/(3nc  nf )g2), where  is a certain reference
mass scale. the resulting we turns out to be w w/4, which is the tree superpotential for the gauge kinetic term. if
s is integrated out [15], one reaches the ads-type superpotential [2]:

2

w ads

e = (nf  nc)(cid:20) det (t ) f (z)

3ncnf (cid:21)1/(nf nc)

.

(5)

in this case, w ads
namely z = 1, is satised. the simplest form of f (z) that satises f (z) = 0 can be given by

vanishes in the classical limit only if f (z) = 0, where the constraint of bt nf nc b = det (t ),

e

f (z) = (1  z) ( > 0),

(6)

where  is a free parameter.

if one avor becomes heavy, our superpotential exhibits a holomorphic decoupling property. add a mass to the nf

avor, then we have

we = s(cid:26)ln(cid:20) sncnf det (t ) f (z)

3ncnf

(cid:21) + nf  nc(cid:27)  mt nf

nf

.

(7)

following a usual procedure, we divide t into t with a light avor (nf  1)  (nf  1) submatrix and t nf
and also
nf
b and b into light avored b and b and heavy avored parts. at susy minimum, the o-diagonal elements of t
and the heavy avored b and b vanish and t nf
= s/m is derived. this relation is referred to as konishi anomaly
nf
relation [18]. inserting this relation into eq.(7), we obtain

we = s(ln" sncnf +1det( t )f ( z)

3ncnf +1

# + nf  nc  1) ,

(8)

where z = b t nf nc1 b/det( t ) from z = bt nf
nf
the heavy avor is decoupled at low energies, we are left with eq.(1) with nf  1 avors.

t nf nc1 b/t nf
nf

det( t ) and 3ncnf +1 = m3ncnf . thus, after

we can also derive an eective superpotential for nf = nc  1 by letting one avor to be heavy in eq.(1) for nf

= nc. for nf = nc, at susy vacuum, we nd that

det (t ) f (z) = 2nc,

(9)

which turns out to be the usual quantum constraint [1,13] of det (t )  b b = 2nc if  = 1 giving f (z) = 1  z.
the discussion goes through in the similar manner to the previous one. in this case, we nd b = b = 0, leading to
z = 0, and t = s/m at susy minimum. as a result, eq.(1) with nf = nc  1 is derived if 2nc+1 is identied with
m2nc/f (0), where f (0) = 1 by eq.(6). the induced we is nothing but the famous ads superpotential [2] after s
is integrated out. it is thus proved that our superpotential with eq.(6) exhibits the holomorphic decoupling property
and provides the correct superpotential for nc < nf .

next, we proceed to discussing what physics is expected in sqcd especially with nc +2  nf  3nc/2. it is known
that keeping chiral symmetries unbroken requires the duality description using magnetic quarks. therefore, another
dynamics, if it is allowed, necessarily induces spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetries. in our superpotential,
eq.(1), this dynamical feature is more visible when soft susy breaking eects are token into account. although
the elimination of s from we gives no eects on the susy vacuum, to evaluate soft susy breaking contributions
can be well handled by we with s. since physics very near the susy-invariant vacua is our main concern, all
breaking masses are kept much smaller than . the property of sqcd is then inferred from the one examined in the
corresponding susy-broken vacuum, which is smoothly connected to the susy-preserving vacuum.

let us briey review what was discussed in ref. [16] in a slightly dierent manner. to see solely the susy breaking
eect, we adopt the simplest term that is invariant under the chiral symmetries, which is given by the following mass
term, lmass, for the scalar quarks, i

a, and antiquarks, a
i :

 lmass =xi,a (cid:0)2

l|i

with the denition of we;i  we /i, etc., where ,i,b, b, respectively, represent the scalar components of s, t i

b[12nc] and b[12nc]. the coecient gt comes from the kahlar potential, k, which is assumed to be diagonal,

which cannot be satised by a6=1 = 0. in fact, a6=1 = 1 is a solution to this problem, leading to |a| = |1| (= 2

t ).
since the classical constraint of f (z) = 0 is expected not to be modied at the susy minimum, the susy breaking
eect may arise as tiny deviation of f (z) from 0, which is denoted by   1  z ( 1). by further using the explicit
form of eq.(6) for f (z), we nd

in the leading order of . therefore, in softly broken sqcd, our superpotential indicates the breakdown of all chiral
symmetries. this feature is in accord with the result of the dynamics of ordinary qcd [20].

does the resulting susy-breaking vacuum structure persist in the susy limit? at the susy minimum with the
suggested vacuum of |a=1nc| = 2
t , we nd the classical constraint of f (z) = 0, as expected, which is derived by
using we; = 0 and by noticing that /i=nc+1nf = 0 from we;i = 0. in the susy limit dened by   0,
i=nc+1nf vanish to recover chiral su (nf  nc) symmetry and  vanishes to recover chiral u (1) symmetry. the
symmetry breaking is thus described by

su (nf )l  su (nf )r  u (1)v  u (1)a

 su (nc)l+r  su (nf  nc)l  su (nf  nc)r  u (1)

v  u (1)

v is associated with the number of (nf  nc)-plet superelds of su (nf  nc) and u (1)

where u (1)
a is associated
with the number of su (nc)l+r - adjoin and - singlet fermions and of scalars of the (nf  nc)-plet. the susy
vacuum characterized by |a=1nc| = 2
t yields spontaneous breakdown of su (nc)l  su (nc)r to su (nc)l+r. in
other words, once the spontaneous breaking is triggered, then |i=1nc| = 2
t is a natural solution to sqcd, where
soft susy breaking can be consistently introduced. this breaking behavior is translated into the corresponding
behavior in the higgs phase by the complementarity [4,19]. to generate su (nc)l+r can be achieved by h0|a
a|0i
= a
a t , for a, a = 1  nc. the anomaly-matching is trivially satised in the higgs phase.
the complementarity shows that massless particles are just supplied by t b=1nc
,
a=1nc
i=nc+1nf
t i=nc+1nf
, b[12nc] and b[12nc], which are all contained in the nambu-goldstone superelds. therefore, the
a=1nc
anomaly-matching is automatically satised as a result of the spontaneous breakdown and is a dynamical consequence.
let us discuss eects of susy-invariant mass terms. if any quarks with avors of su (nf  nc) are massive, we can
determine their vacuum structure from the holomorphic decoupling property. on the other hand, if all quarks with
avors of su (nf  nc) are massive, we can further utilize instanton contributions [21] to prescribe vacuum structure.
if our superpotential provides correct description of sqcd, both results must be consistent with each other.

the instanton calculation for the gluino and nf massless quarks and antiquarks concerns the following su (nc) -

a = c2nc

(19)

(20)

where c (6= 0) is a coecient to be xed. at our susy minimum, the condition of we / = 0 together with
we /i = 0 for i = nc + 1  nf giving /i = mi reads

f (z) =

nc

nf

ya=1(cid:0)2/a(cid:1)

yi=nc+1

(mi/) .

(21)

by combining these two relations, we observe that the mass dependence in f (z) is completely cancelled and derive c
= 1/f (z) giving f (z) 6=0 instead of f (z) = 0 for the massless sqcd. since f (z) = (1  z), z 6= 1 is required and the
classical constraint, corresponding to z = 1, is modied. these vevs are the solution to

det( t )f ( z) = 2nc,

(22)

where 2nc = 3ncnf qnf

i=n c+1 mi, which is the quantum constraint (9) for nf = nc and which is also consistent
with the successive use of the holomorphic decoupling. therefore, our superpotential for nc + 2  nf  3nc/2
supplemented by the instanton contributions is shown to provide a consistent vacuum structure for sqcd with nf
= nc compatible with the holomorphic decoupling.

a comment is in order for the case with  = 1. the quantum constraint for nf = nc, eq.(9), is rewritten as

det(t )1(cid:2)det(t )  b b(cid:3)

= 2nc.

(23)

if  6= 1, det(t ) 6= 0 is required and shows the spontaneous breakdown of chiral su (nf ) symmetry. there is no room
for det(t ) = 0. while, if  = 1 as in the seibergs choice [1], there are two options: one for the spontaneous breakdown
of chiral su (nf ) symmetry and the other for that of vector u (1) symmetry of the baryon number. the latter case
a=1 a, and is possible to be

in summary, we have demonstrated that dynamical symmetry breaking in the electric sqcd with nc + 2  nf

it should be stressed that, in addition to the usually believed physics of magnetic sqcd, where chiral su (nf )
symmetry is restored, our suggested physics of spontaneous chiral symmetry breakdown is expected to be realized
in electric sqcd at least for nc + 2  nf  3nc/2. therefore, we expect that there are two phases in sqcd:
one with unbroken chiral symmetries realized in magneic sqcd and the other with spontaneously broken chiral
symmetries realized in electric sqcd.
