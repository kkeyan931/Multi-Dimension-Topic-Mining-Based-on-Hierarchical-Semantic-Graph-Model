consistent nonlinear kk reduction of 11d supergravity

on ads7  s4 and self-duality in odd dimensions

abstract

we show that there exists a consistent truncation of 11 dimensional
supergravity to the massless elds of maximal (n=4) 7 dimensional
gauged supergravity. we nd the complete expressions for the nonlinear
embedding of the 7 dimensional elds into the 11 dimensional elds, and
check them by reproducing the d=7 susy transformation laws from the
d=11 laws in various sectors. in particular we determine explicitly the
matrix u which connects the killing spinors to the gravitinos in the kk
ansatz, and the dependence of the 4-index eld strength on the scalars.
this is the rst time a complete nonlinear kk reduction of the original
d=11 supergravity on a nontrivial compact space has been explicitly
given. we need a rst order formulation for the 3 index tensor eld
a in d=11 to reproduce the 7 dimensional result. the concept of
self-duality in odd dimensions is thus shown to originate from rst order
formalism in higher dimensions. for the ads-cft correspondence, our
results imply that one can use 7d gauged supergravity (without further
massive modes) to compute certain correlators in the d=6 (0,2) cft at
leading order in n. this eliminates an ambiguity in the formulation of
the correspondence.

the question whether in general a consistent kaluza-klein (kk) truncation exists
at the nonlinear level is an old problem. for tori, the consistency is easy to prove,
but for more complicated compact spaces little is known. in supergravity (sugra), the
truncation of d=11 sugra on ads4  s7 to maximal d = 4 gauged sugra was intensively
studied 15 years ago [1], culminating in a series of papers by de wit and nicolai [2, 3].
the interest in those days was to nd realistic 4 dimensional models from spontaneous
compactication of maximal 11 dimensional sugra. recent developments in the ads-
cft correspondence [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] have renewed interest in ads compactications

to 5 and 7 dimensions. a crucial question is whether the ads5  s5 and ads7 
s4 compactications allow consistent truncations to the massless sector, because if
there does not exist a consistent truncation, massive elds have to be considered for
computations of correlators in the corresponding cft [6].

de wit and nicolai rst studied the kk reduction of the original formulation of
d=11 sugra [2], but then they found it advantageous to construct a dierent formulation
of d=11 sugra with a local su(8) invariance [3]. because the local su(8) invariance
rotates bianchi identities into eld equations, the action for the su(8) sugra did not
follow directly from the original d=11 action [3]). for this su(8) formulation the
complete nonlinear kk reduction on ads7  s4 was given: they proposed nonlinear
ansatze and checked the consistency of the kk truncation on ads4  s7 as far as the
bosonic and fermionic transformation rules are concerned. it may be that the su(8)
theory will turn out to be important for future research in string theory, but we prefer
to work with the original formulation. the connection was formulated in terms of a
matrix u for which they derived an equation, but they only could solve this equation
in certain sectors. (ref. [2]a, eq. (3.12) and ref. [2]b, eq. (2.14)).

in this article we analyze the kk reduction of d=11 sugra on ads7  s4. this will
allow us to go further than the work on ads4 s7. as we already mentioned, in ref. [2]
d=11 sugra was rst reformulated in a form with a local su (8)  so(1, 3) in tangent
space instead of the usual so(1,10).
in our case, we choose not to go through the
intermediate step of nding a formulation of 11d sugra with a corresponding local so(5)
invariance, hence we will directly work with the d=11 sugra as it is usually formulated.
in this letter we present our main results leaving the details of the calculations for a
future publication [9].

one of the reasons to study the ads7  s4 case is that we would like to understand
the origin of the mysterious self-duality in odd dimensions [10] which appears in var-
ious supergravities in odd dimensions. to obtain the action for selfdual tensors one
begins with the antisymmetric tensor from d=11 whose action is quadratic in deriva-
tives, and introduces the square of an extra auxiliary antisymmetric tensor eld in
the lower dimension by hand, rotates both tensors, factorizes the second order eld
equations into two eld equations linear in derivatives, and drops one of the factors.
the end product is an action of the form f a + a2 [10] which is dual to chern-simons
theory for the abelian case [11] but not for the nonabelian case [12].
in sugra the
nonabelian version appears.

maximal (n=4) sugra in 7 dimensions has a 3 index tensor s,a (a=1,5) with a
self-dual action. because in the linearized kk reduction one needs to introduce an
auxiliary eld b  b in d=7 to construct this action [13], we will start from a
rst order formulation for a in d=11, and deduce self-duality. the 11 dimensional
lagrangian we start from and its supersymmetry transformations rules are given in
the table i, where , , ... = 0, 10 are curved vector indices and m,n,...=0,10 are at
vector indices. the action is invariant under the susy laws for any value of the real
constants a and b. we will x them later by the requirement of consistent truncation.

the action in table i contains a new rst-order formulation as far as the 3-index
tensor eld a is concerned. there exists also a rst order formulation of d=11
sugra with an independent spin connection  [15]. initially we tried to deduce the d=7
selfduality from this eld , but this did not work [9]. instead we will work with a
second order formalism for the spin connection.

added a matrix u i

a su(8) matrix u was found to be needed to obtain consistency of the kk reduction in
certain sectors, but then a reformulation of the theory with full local su(8) invariance
was constructed [3]. we introduce the matrix u as in [2], but we shall not go to a
dierent formulation of d=11 sugra.

at this point we have come in 7 dimensions as far as others in 4 dimensions. how-
ever, we have been able to nd the solution for u. first of all, we have been able to
show that (11) follows from (13), so that (13) is the crucial equation. the covariant
solution of (13) built out of y a and vi is unique and reads

it was determined by moving one of the u matrices in (13) to the right-hand side

restricts u to f1+f2y/+f3v/+f4y avjbj ab, where fj depends only on y v. requiring
(8) and (13) leads to (14).
next we turn to the ansatz for f. at the linearized level it contains the
uctuations in g and g , and uctuations in a [13]. at the nonlinear level,
an ansatz for f containing only the uctuations in g and yielding the correct
chern-simons actions in d=7 was given in [18, 19]. we now present the complete
expression for f; it contains the results of [13] and [18, 19] (at the limit when the
scalar elds are set to zero) and it satises the bianchi identities.

this ansatz was obtained by requiring consistency of the susy laws, namely that
the the 11-dimensional susy variation law (d = 11)f = d[(d = 11)a can
be written as a total 7-dimensional susy variation (d = 7 f ields). our present ansatz
reproduces the linearized limit of ref. [13], and it coincides with the geometrical pro-
posal by [18, 19] when we let t ab = ab. the t -dependent terms in (15) and (16)
which are b-independent separately satisfy the bianchi identity, even though they are
not an exact form. the terms with a as well as the b dependent terms are exact
and thus they trivially satisfy the bianchi identities. the chern-simons terms in d=7
are not aected by the partial dressing with scalar elds of some spherical harmonics
of the ansatz proposed by freed et al. [19]. the precise expression of the 4-form added
in the f sector is highly constrained.
it must reproduce the linearized term in
[13], and it must yield the correct scalar potential in d=7 after integrating over the
compact space. in order to perform this integral to which both the einstein action
and the kinetic action of the 3-index photon contribute, we start with the metric in
the internal space and its inverse:

g = 4/5c

ac

bt 1

ab ; g = 2/5(cid:16)c 
ac 

bt abycydt cd  c 

aybt abc 

cydt cd(cid:17)(20)

where c a
 = y a is a conformal killing vector. we can thus interpret the defor-
mations of the background metric as describing an ellipsoid with the conformal factor
4/5, whose axes at a specic point y in the d=7 space time are determined by the
eigenvalues of t 1
ab. when setting the gauge elds to zero and disregarding the terms
with d=7 space time derivatives, the integral over the compact space of the einstein
action is already of the desired form, namely a linear combination of t 2 and t r(t 2).
on the other hand, the integrated kinetic action of the 3 index photon has the form

4 qdet g (x)(yeyf t ef )2(1 + s)2, where (3/2)qdet g (x)s is the extra
r d4x9
term we need to add in f besides its background value. this function s should
be of degree zero in t and vanishes in the background. in order that the d=7 scalar
potential be of the form (t rt )2  2t rt 2, we can only admit terms in s of the form
[t rt /(y  t  y )  5] + [y  t 2  y /(y  t  y )2  1]. requiring agreement with the
linearized ansatz yields  = 1/3, while  satises the quadratic equation ( +2/3) = 0
in order to reproduce the d=7 scalar potential. the solution  = 0 does not produce
the correct gravitino law, hence consistency requires  = 2/3.

at this moment all the ansatze are xed, and we can verify the remaining terms in
the 7d susy transformation rules (ii.4,ii.6,ii.7). this provides a number of independent
nontrivial checks on all our ansatze. the calculations involved in these checks will be
publised elsewhere [9]. they involve heavy use of the formalism of spherical harmonics
[20].

finally, let us comment on applications to the ads-cft correspondence. the fact
that there exists a consistent truncation means that we can use the 7 dimensional
gauged sugra action for calculations of correlators of the operators in the 6d (0,2) cft
which correspond to the gauged supergravity elds, at leading order in n. indeed,
consistency of the truncation means that there are no linear couplings of massive
elds to the gauged sugra, and so in the tree diagrams of gauged sugra the massive
elds will not appear. in [21], a computation of correlators of chiral primary operators
in the cft was performed, following the work for the ads5  s5 case in [22] (for
other calculations of 3- and 4-point functions see [7, 8]) . to nd the correct cft
behaviour, a nonlinear redenition of the scalar elds was also needed, which did
result in a consistent truncation of the scalar modes to the massless ones. the nonlinear
redenition in d = 7 is equivalent to our nonlinear embedding in d = 11 for the massless
modes, but note that the results of [21] are only up to quadratic order (and only for the
scalars) whereas we do nd a fully consistent truncation to all massless modes. with
our results one can extend the calculations of cft correlators to the other massless
(sugra) bosonic sectors and to the fermionic sector.

we expect that we can also nd a consistent truncation in the ads5  s5 case, in
which the same comments apply to the correspondence between ads5  s5 and n=4
d=4 sym. (again, a consistent truncation of the scalar modes to the massless ones
was implicitly obtained in [22], by imposing the correct cft behaviour). perhaps our
methods can also be used to complete the explicit expression for the truncation on
ads4  s7.
