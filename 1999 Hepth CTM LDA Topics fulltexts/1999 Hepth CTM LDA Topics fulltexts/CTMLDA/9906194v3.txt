abstract

states on the coulomb branch of n = 4 super-yang-mills theory are studied from
the point of view of gauged supergravity in ve dimensions. these supersymmetric
solutions provide examples of consistent truncation from type iib supergravity in ten
dimensions. a mass gap for states created by local operators and perfect screening for
external quarks arise in the supergravity approximation. we oer an interpretation of
these surprising features in terms of ensembles of brane distributions.

1 introduction

the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] has been primarily studied in the conformal
vacuum of n = 4 super-yang-mills theory. however, it also includes other states in
the hilbert space of the theory; these correspond to certain solutions of the super-
gravity eld equations in which the bulk space-time geometry approaches ads5 near
the boundary, but diers from ads5 in the interior. sometimes a simpler picture of
states in the gauge theory emerges from the ten-dimensional geometry. for instance,
two equal clusters of coincident d3-branes separated by a distance  correspond to the
vacuum state of the gauge theory where the su(n) gauge symmetry has been broken
to su(n/2)  su(n/2) by scalar vacuum expectation values (vevs). this congu-
ration has been studied in [4, 5]. more generally, one could consider any distribution
of the n d3-branes in the six transverse dimensions. these congurations preserve
sixteen supersymmetries, as appropriate since the poincare supersymmetries of the
gauge theory are maintained but superconformal invariance is broken by the higgsing.
the space of possible distributions is precisely the moduli space symn r6 of the gauge
theory. it is known as the coulomb branch because the gauge bosons which remain
massless mediate long-range coulomb interactions.

at the origin of moduli space, where all the branes are coincident, the near-horizon

geometry is ads5  s5. each factor has a radius of curvature l given by

l4 =

10n
25/2 ,

(1)

where 10 is the ten-dimensional gravitational constant. if the branes are not coinci-
dent, but the average distance  between them is much less than l, then the geometry
will still have a near-horizon region which is asymptotically ads5  s5. from the
ve-dimensional perspective, the deviations from this limiting geometry arise through
non-zero background values for scalars in the supergravity theory. at linear order these
background values are solutions of the free wave-equations for the scalars with regular
behavior near the boundary of ads5, and so we recover the usual picture of states in
the gauge theory in ads/cft. given a particular vacuum state, specied by a dis-
tribution of branes in ten dimensions or an asymptotically ads5 geometry with scalar
proles in ve dimensions, it is natural to ask what predictions the correspondence
makes regarding greens functions and wilson loops.

from the point of view of supergravity, the two-center solution is complicated because
innitely many scalar elds are involved in the ve dimensional description. the
present paper is therefore concerned with states on the coulomb branch that are simple
from the point of view of supergravity: they will involve only the scalars in the massless
n = 8, ve-dimensional supergraviton multiplet. more specically, we will investigate

geometries involving proles for the supergravity modes dual to the operators

tr x(ixj) =(cid:16)k

i l
j  1

6 ijkl(cid:17) tr xkxl .

(2)

these operators and their dual elds in supergravity transform in the 20 of so(6).

all the geometries we consider preserve sixteen supercharges, and this allows us to
reduce the eld equations to a rst-order system. the geometries naturally separate
into ve universality classes, identied according to the asymptotic behavior far from
the boundary of ads5. there is a privileged member in each class which preserves
so(n)  so(6  n) of the so(6) local gauge symmetry for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (as usual
so(1) is the trivial group). we identify the distribution of d3-branes in ten dimensions
which leads to each of the privileged geometries: in each case the distribution is a n-
dimensional ball. next, we investigate the behavior of two-point correlators and wilson
loops. surprisingly, we nd a mass gap in the two-point correlator for n = 2 and a
completely discrete spectrum for n > 2. also, wilson loops exhibit perfect screening for
n  2 for quark-anti-quark separations larger than the inverse mass gap. we suggest a
tentative interpretation of these results in terms of an average over positions of branes
within the distribution.

this study is an outgrowth of the work of [6], in which it was found that there are
soliton solutions of the supergravity theory which preserve n = 1 poincare supersym-
metry. the scalar elds in these n = 1 ows lie in two-dimensional submanifolds of
the 42-dimensional scalar coset e6(6)/usp(8), of which one eld is a component of the
20 and the other of the 10  10 representation. the n = 2 and n = 4 geometries
considered below correspond to special solutions of the ow equations of [6] in which
the 10  10 component vanishes and supersymmetry is enhanced to n = 4.

2 supergravity solutions

maximal n = 8 gauged supergravity in four dimensions is a consistent truncation of
eleven-dimensional supergravity compactied on s7 (see [7] and references therein),
and the same has recently been demonstrated for the maximal gauged supergravity
theory in seven dimensions [8]. there is little doubt that maximal n = 8 gauged
supergravity in ve dimensions is likewise a consistent truncation of ten-dimensional
type iib supergravity on s5, although a formal proof has not been given. consistent
truncation means that elds of the parent theory and its truncation are related by an
ansatz such that any solution of the equations of motion of the truncated theory lifts
unambiguously to a solution of the parent theory.

gauged n = 8 supergravity in ve dimensions [9, 10, 11] involves 42 scalars parametriz-
ing the coset e6(6)/usp(8). an important ingredient in consistent truncation argu-
ments is a map that takes any element of the coset to a particular deformed metric on

2

s5. the identity element is associated to the round s5. the general form of the map
was essentially given in [12], in terms of the scalar 27-bein, v, of e6(6)/usp(8). the
resulting ten-dimensional metric ds2 has the form of a warped product:

ds2 = 2/3ds2

m + ds2

k ,

(3)

m is the metric on the ve noncompact coordinates and ds2

where ds2
k is the metric on
the deformed s5. the warp factor  depends on the s5 coordinates, and it is roughly
the local dilation of the volume element of s5. there can be m-dependence in ds2
k
but not vice versa.

the group e6(6) contains sl(6, r)  sl(2, r) as a maximal subgroup. the 20 of
scalars which we want to consider parametrizes the coset sl(6, r)/so(6). choosing
a representative s  sl(6, r) for a specied element of the coset, we can form the
symmetric matrix m = sst . the theory depends only on this combination, and the
so(6) symmetry acts on it by conjugation. so we may take m to be diagonal:

m = diag{e21, e22, e23, e24, e25, e26} .

there are no extrema of w except for the global maximum when all the a are
0. all ows have some a   in nite or innite . asymptotically they must
approach a xed direction: a  a where a is a xed vector, with 2 = 2 so that 
is canonically normalized. the sign of a matters because we take   + far from
the boundary of ads5. it is straightforward to verify that the possible a are those
listed in table 1.

for each a, there is a privileged ow determined by the condition that a = a
exactly all along the ow, rather than just asymptotically. this condition leaves just
one parameter of freedom to determine the ow: a quantity 2 which controls the size of
 near the boundary of ads5 and is proportional to ho20i, where o20 is the operator
dual to . the symmetry groups preserved by the privileged ows are also listed in
table 1. each of them can be lifted unambiguously to a ten-dimensional geometry,
which in each case can be written in the form

the n-dimensional integral is over a ball of radius  in n of the six dimensions trans-
verse to the d3-branes. the distribution of branes, ( ~w), depends only on | ~w| and is
normalized to 1. the various n as functions of w = | ~w| are listed in table 1. it is
amusing to note that if one starts with the uniform disk of branes specied by 2 and
compresses it to a line segment by projecting the position of each brane perpendicu-
larly onto one axis, the result is the distribution 1. the analogous projection relations
obtain between n and n1 for n = 3, 4, 5. the distribution 5 has the form
(2  w2)! .

table 1: a summary of the privileged n = 4 geometries and their properties. it is
helpful to note that the distributions  vanish by denition for w > .

unlike all the other n, 5 is not uniformly positive. this is a deep pathology which
leads us to conclude that this geometry is unphysical. it cannot even be interpreted
in terms of anti-d3-branes: negative charge in 5 indicates an object of negative
tension as well as opposite ramond-ramond charge to the d3-brane. the only such
objects in string theory are orientifold planes, but to make up the 5 in (13) one would
require innitely many o3-planes, which again seems senseless. it is curious that the
n = 5 case has such pathological ten-dimensional origins: in ve dimensions its naked
singularity is of much the same type as for n < 5.

the distribution 2 was considered previously in [14] in connection with a zero
temperature, zero angular momentum limit of a spinning d3-brane metric with angular
momentum in a single plane perpendicular to the branes. as shown in [15, 16, 17],
the kaluza-klein reduction of the spinning brane geometry to ve dimensions involves
only the elds of the gauged supergravity multiplet, and in fact it is a non-extremal r-
charged black hole of the type discussed in [18]. indeed the ve-dimensional geometry
corresponding to n = 2 can be shown to be precisely the extremal limit of this black hole
geometry where the mass approaches the charge from above: m  q+ in appropriate
ve-dimensional units. amusingly, the n = 4 geometry is precisely the m  q limit
of r-charged black holes whose mass is less than their charge. these black holes have
naked timelike singularities like the negative mass schwarzschild solution, and they are
usually deemed unphysical. the naked singularity remains in the m  q limit, but it
is seen as a benign eect of the kaluza-klein reduction: the ten-dimensional geometry
has only a null singular horizon. geometries with the same sort of naked singularity
in ve dimensions have been studied in [19] and also in [20, 21, 22] in connection

5

with connement. the well-dened ten-dimensional geometry provides the rst clear-
cut evidence that such singular ve-dimensional geometries must have a role in the
correspondence. it should be noted that the n = 4 geometry can also be obtained as

a m  (q/2)+ limit of a doubly-r-charged black hole corresponding to d3-branes

with two equal angular momenta in orthogonal planes, and that the distribution 4
arose in [14] in this context.

it is in principle straightforward to derive all the information in table 1 by the
following strategy. first integrate the supersymmetry conditions (10), which for our

the metrics for n = 4 and n = 5 can be obtained from the n = 2 and n = 1 cases,
respectively, by replacing 2  2.

3 a two-point function

usually the simplest two-point function to compute in supergravity is ho4(x)o4(0)i,
where o4 = tr f 2 + . . . is the operator which couples to the s-wave dilaton. by s-
wave we mean asymptotically independent of the s5 coordinates. in ten dimensions
the dilaton obeys the free wave equation,  = 0. solutions exist which are exactly
independent of the s5 coordinates (not just asymptotically), and these obey the ve-
dimensional laplace equation  = 0 in the near-horizon geometry. if we restored the
1 in the harmonic function h, then this equation would only hold in the near-horizon
region, and only in the limit where

  l

.

(17)

here  is the energy of a radially infalling dilaton. the ratio /l2 can be arbitrary in
the limit indicated in (17). the absorption cross-section for the dilaton is a complicated
function of , l, and , and only the leading term in small l and small /l is available
via the ads/cft correspondence.

the properties of the ve-dimensional wave equation will be most transparent if the

metric is of the form

ds2 = e2a(z)(cid:16)dt2  dx2

1  dx2

2  dx2

3  dz2(cid:17) .

(18)

one can show that far from the boundary of ads5 one has the behavior a  
and da/dz  (const.)ea(16 2), where  is the largest positive entry in the vector a.
if   1/6, the geometry is conformal to the half of r4,1 where z > 0. in general,
curvatures are unbounded as z  . if  > 1/6, then a   at some z = z, and
there is a naked timelike singularity there. we have  < 1/6 for n = 1,  = 1/6 for
n = 2, and  > 1/6 for n > 2.

setting

figure 1: the various behaviors for v (z) far from the boundary of ads5: a) vanishes;
b) asymptotes to a nite value; c) increases without bound; d) decreases without

as usual we work in + convention. the potential v (z) exhibits four dierent
behaviors, which are illustrated in figure 1. the rst is encountered for the n = 1
ow; the second for the n = 2 ow; the third for n = 3; and the fourth for n = 4, 5.
the spectrum of possible values for s = p2 is determined by the form of v : it consists
of discrete points for solutions of (20) which are normalizable and/or a continuum
corresponding to solutions which are almost normalizable in the same sense as plane
waves are. for n = 1 the spectrum is continuous, and it covers the whole positive
real s-axis. for n = 2 the spectrum is also continuous, but it covers only the interval
(2/l4,) on the s-axis: there is a mass gap! for n = 3, 4, 5 the spectrum is discrete
and positive, and the lowest eigenvalue for s is on the order 2/l4. note that the
case n = 5, though pathological in ten-dimensional origin, is stable with respect to
uctuations of a minimally coupled scalar. it would be interesting to nd some way
of perceiving the pathology of ghost d3-branes with negative tension and negative
charge directly in ve dimensions.

the spectrum of (20) determines the analyticity properties of the two-point function

in the complex s-plane, where again s = p2. the function 4(s) is analytic except at
the points along the s-axis which are included in the spectrum: points in the discrete
spectrum correspond to poles in 4(s), and intervals in the continuous spectrum cor-

8

respond to cuts. in principle, 4(s) can be determined from solutions to (20) which
approach a constant as z  0, using the prescription of [2, 3]. in practice one needs
an explicit solution to make much progress, and so far we have results only for n = 2
and n = 4. to compute the two-point function for n = 2, the relevant solutions to the
wave equation

 = 0 is

from asymptotically at innity (far from the d3-branes).

these are precisely the excited state energy levels of a rigid rotator, but we do not see
any obvious interpretation of j as an angular momentum quantum number. the wave
functions for these values of m2 are hypergeometric polynomials.

an equation equivalent to

 = 0 for n = 4 arose in the study of euclideanized d3-branes with
a single large imaginary angular momentum [23, 24]. this is not a surprise, since the n = 2 and n = 4
metrics are related via   i, and this same replacement is necessary in wick rotating n = 2 to
euclidean signature. the discrete glueball spectrum computed there (numerically) coincides with
(26), but it appears to have a rather dierent interpretation in this context: the higgs vevs are
responsible for the energy scale, not connement. s.s.g. would like to thank m. cvetic for useful
discussions regarding discrete spectra in similar contexts.

it is straightforward to extend the analysis to two-point functions of operators cor-
responding to partial waves of the dilaton whose angular momenta are in planes with
 = 0. we will not go into detail here, but only state that it does not aect the
qualitative behavior of v , and for n = 2 it does not even eect the numerical value of
the gap. partial waves with angular momentum not perpendicular to the d3-branes
lead in general to non-separable partial dierential equations in our variables, but we
expect the same qualitative conclusions to stand.

in weakly coupled gauge theory, the behavior of the two-point function is very dier-
ent. the operator o4 can create two gauge bosons, and the two-point function at zero
t hooft coupling can be evaluated from a one-loop graph with two o4 insertions. in
the conformal vacuum of super-yang-mills theory, the results of [25] indicate that the
one-loop graph, with only gauge bosons running around the loop, gives exact agree-
ment with the strong coupling result. the subsequent understanding of this agreement
from the point of view of non-renormalization theorems [26, 27, 28, 29, 30], and the
role of lower spin elds and on-shell ambiguities in o4, are for us side issues, because
none of the non-renormalization theorems is expected to hold away from the origin of
the moduli space. the masses of individual gauge bosons or their superpartners are
protected, and this is because they are bps excitations; but this does not imply that
interactions cannot correct the one-loop graph.

the distribution of masses of gauge bosons follows from the distribution of branes

through the formula

(m) =  vol sn1(m)n1z dny (~y)(~y + me) ,

(27)

where e is an arbitrary unit vector in n dimensions. in all cases the maximum mass for
a gauge boson is 2/, because the diameter of (~y) is 2. the average gauge boson
mass, hmwi, is also / up to a factor of order unity. in (27) we have normalized 
so that r dm (m) = 1. the qualitative features follow from the support of , which is
(0, 2/), and the behavior near m = 0, which is

one recovers the conformal limit disc 4(s)  n 2s2 for s  hmwi2, with corrections
suppressed by powers of hmwi2/s.
if (m)  m/hmwi1+ for m  hmwi, then
disc 4(s)  s5+/hmwi1+ for s  hmwi2. this is in contrast with the supergravity
results: there the conformal limit is recovered for s  /l2, which is a much lower
energy since /l2  hmwi/qg2
y m n ; also, in the n = 2 case, one can show that
corrections to disc 4(s)  n 2s2 are suppressed by powers of el4s/2
. also the
gapped spectrum for n = 2 and the discrete spectrum for n = 3, 4 are in contrast with
the expectation based on the continuous distribution of branes. in summary, the two-
point function 4(s) exhibits nearly conformal power-law behavior down to a much
lower energy scale than the typical gauge boson mass. below this low scale the physics
is radically dierent from gauge theory expectations, and very sensitive to n. we will
come back to this conundrum in section 5.

4 wilson loops

vq q(r)  qg2

to compute the quark-anti-quark potential from wilson loops on the supergravity side,
we follow [31, 32]. the asymptotically ads5 geometry controls the small r behavior:
y m n /r. the deviations from the coulomb law become important on a
length scale l2/, rather than / as in the weakly coupled gauge theory. beyond this
point, one sees a stronger power law for n = 1, and perfect screening (with a caveat
which we will come to shortly) for n > 1.

because there is no dilaton prole, the ten-dimensional string metric and einstein
metric are the same, and wilson loops (more properly t hooft loops) built from
d1-branes will show the same behavior as those built from fundamental strings, up
to the overall coecient of vq q. near the boundary of ads5, each end of the string
can be constrained to lie anywhere on s5. most of the trajectories do not lie in a
plane, and are dicult to analyze. the simple cases are where the string stays either
in the hyperplane of r6 which contains the brane distribution, or in the orthogonal
hyperplane. the rst case is  = /2 for n  3 and  = 0 for n > 3, in the coordinate
systems used in (16); the second case is  = 0 for n  3 and  = /2 for n > 3. the
analysis proceeds most straightforwardly with a radial variable u such that gttguu = 1.

where c is the trajectory of the wilson loop in the xu plane. by assumption, u = 0
is the location of the branes (in our cases, it is where curvatures become innite).
assuming convex f (u), one can proceed as in appendix a of [22] to determine the
qualitative behavior of vq q(r). namely, if f (u)  u with 0 <  < 2, then there
is perfect screening (vq q = 0) at suciently large r; if f (u)  u with  > 2, then
vq q(r)  r2/(2) (note that  = 4 corresponds to the coulomb law), and if f (u) is
bounded below, then one obtains an area law vq q(r)  r.

it is straightforward to transform to variables u in each of the ten cases we consider,
or to derive the general result that if gtt  r and grr  r, then  = 4/(2 +  + ). a
subtlety arises when n > 3: in these cases the distribution of branes is at r =  rather
than r = 0, so one should replace r  r +  before performing the scaling analysis
around r = 0. the results are quoted in table 2. for the n = 2,  = 0 case we nd
that perfect screening sets in at r = l2/2. we have put connement in quotations
in table 2 because it is really a fake: while it is true that a wilson loop constrained to
lie in the  = /2 plane for n > 3 does exhibit an area law, a physical string at large r
would eventually nd it energetically favorable to creep up toward the  = 0 plane and
enjoy perfect screening. there is a spontaneous so(n) symmetry breaking associated
with the orientation of the string in the (n  1)-sphere of (16). this is the caveat we
mentioned in the rst section.

the weak coupling gauge theory expectation, given a distribution (m) which is cut

as before, hmwi = / up to a factor of order unity. interestingly, the infrared power
law in the n = 1 case is 1/r2, just as we saw for  = 0 in supergravity.

5 discussion

we have constructed and studied geometries which have simple descriptions both in
ve-dimensional gauged supergravity as asymptotically ads5 geometries with proles
for some scalars in sl(6, r)/so(6), and in n = 4 super-yang-mills theory as vacua on
the coulomb branch. the ten-dimensional geometry, composed of n parallel d3-branes
in some continuous distribution in the r6 space perpendicular to their world-volumes,
leaves little doubt of the coulomb branch interpretation; but the gapped or discrete
spectra in the two-point function and the perfect screening observed in wilson loops
do not seem compatible with gauge theory expectations. in particular, there just isnt
a mass gap of size /l2 in the gauge theory: one can construct color singlet states of
lower mass by putting two light gauge bosons far apart.

before suggesting a possible resolution, let us re-examine the energy scales involved.
a typical gauge boson has mass hmwi = /, so this is the energy scale at which one
would expect deviations from conformality to become important. but the two-point
function and wilson loop calculations identify the much smaller energy ec = /l2 =
hmwi/qg2
y m n as the scale at which conformal invariance is substantially lost and the
interesting dynamics (e.g. screening, gaps, and discrete spectra) takes place. in a sense
this is precisely the discrepancy in normalization of energy scales observed in [33]:
when converting an energy into a value of the radial coordinate u, energies such as
y m n from the conversion
appropriate to supergravity probes. in the present context, u can be generalized to
a coordinate system ui = yi/ on the r6 perpendicular to the branes. this does
not seem a satisfactory resolution because a mass gap in an absorption calculation is
y m n

hmwi pertaining to stretched strings dier by a factor ofqg2

something that can be compared to masses of brane excitations without any qg2

ambiguity.

a feature that all our geometries share is that curvatures become large close to
the brane distribution. this raises the possibility that an analog of the horowitz-
polchinski correspondence principle [34] is at work. for specicity let us consider only
i ,

the n = 2 case. there is a halo, of thickness /qg2

y m n in the at metric pi dy2

13

surrounding the disk of branes in r6, inside which curvatures are stringy. outside this
halo supergravity applies, and it keeps track of the strong coupling super-yang-mills
dynamics at high energies; inside, or at lower energies, one may expect that a direct
gauge theory description becomes practical. an open string running from the disk to
a test d3-brane on the edge of the halo has a mass on the order /l2. at this energy
scale, one may argue that the gauge theory is no longer strongly coupled because most
of the degrees of freedom have been integrated out: the large n in the t hooft coupling
g2
y m n is substantially reduced.
in this picture, a natural expectation would be that the gap, the discrete spectrum,
and perfect screening will all be washed out in the process of matching onto the low-
energy weakly coupled gauge theory description, to be replaced with the power law
behaviors we described at the ends of sections 3 and 4. this indeed is one possible
resolution of our diculties. it is not a complete resolution because there is still the
region of energies /l2  e  / where supergravity is valid and gives nearly con-
formal predictions at odds with the higgs mass scale in the gauge theory. if it is taken
seriously, then the results of [20, 21, 22] regarding connement from similarly singular
supergravity geometries must be regarded as suspect. however it seems possible to
argue, both in our case and in [20, 21, 22], that in an appropriate large n, large g2
y m n
limit, the wave-function overlap of energy eigenfunctions with the region of stringy or
planckian curvatures is controllably small. in such a limit the most one would expect
is a slight broadening of the eigen-energy delta functions.

as another possible resolution, we would like to suggest that the gauge theory physics
might not be as featureless as the usual coulomb branch analysis implies. the super-
gravity solution species only a continuous distribution of branes, ( ~w), which can only
be approximated by the n branes at our disposal. it seems more natural to regard
( ~w) as specifying not a single distribution of branes, but an ensemble of distributions
where the n branes are allowed to move slightly relative to one another. one should
then include an integration over the ensemble in the path integral: rather taking a
specic point in moduli space as the vacuum, one should integrate over the region of
moduli space which is consistent with the distribution ( ~w). if this integration is done
rst, its eect is to induce extra interaction terms in the lagrangian. with regard to
color indices, these terms do not have a pure trace structure. keeping only the lowest
dimension operators, the schematic form we expect for the lagrangian is

le = tr(xi)2 + tr[xi, xj]2 + (o20)2 + . . . ,

(32)

where for simplicity we keep only the scalar elds and work in euclidean signature.
the operator o20 is the dimension two tr x(ixj) operator whose vev characterizes the
state. the so(6) singlet operator trpi x 2
i is excluded on the grounds that ads/cft
predicts a large dimension for it [2, 3]. the size of  is controlled by how densely the

branes are packed in the distributions approximating ( ~w): the sparser the distribution,
the larger is .

the double trace form of (o20)2 leads to color-independent mass corrections through
diagrams shown schematically in gure 2. typically one expects such mass corrections
to be negative because they come from a second order eect in perturbation theory,
but because o20 is a traceless combination of mass terms for the scalars, at least some
of the mass corrections are positive. also, bubble graphs built using (o20)2 contribute
corrections to the two-point function 4(s). it is possible that if the mass corrections
or the interactions due to (o20)2 are large, they may change the physics enough to
induce the mass gap at /l2, the discrete spectra, and/or the screening observed in
sections 3 and 4. we emphasize the speculative nature of this scenario. however,
the n = 4 gauge dynamics alone does not seem likely to encompass the variety of
physical behaviors that we have seen, and we take it as a clue that the deviations from
the expected weak coupling behavior become more radical as the branes become more
sparsely distributed.

we thank d. kabat for a useful discussion regarding the use of a similar mechanism in another

context [35].
