we propose a modication of the gauge-xing procedure in the lagrangian method
of supereld brst quantization for general gauge theories, which simultaneously
provides a natural generalization of the well-known bv quantization scheme as far
as gauge-xing is concerned. a supereld form of brst symmetry for the vacuum
functional is found. the gauge-independence of the s-matrix is established.

1.

introduction

recently, there has been a fairly large amount of papers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] devoted to various
supereld extensions of the bv quantization method [6] for gauge theories. thus, in [1]
a geometric representation of brst transformations [7] in the form of supertranslations
in superspace was realized; in [2, 3] a superspace formulation of the action and brst
transformations for yang-mills theories was found; in [4] a supereld representation of
the generating operator  in the bv method was suggested; in [5] a closed supereld
form of the bv quantization method [6] was obtained. in the study of [8], a multilevel
generalization of the bv quantization formalism has been proposed, which ensures an
invariant description of eld-antifelds variables.

it is well-known that performing the quantization of a gauge theory is neccessarily re-
lated to introducing a gauge-xing procedure needed for constructing the green functions
and the s-matrix. the methods [5, 6] implement gauge-xing underlied by an appropriate
choice of the fermionic functional, with the only restriction being the non-degeneracy of
the corresponding generating functional.

in the framework of the multilevel generalization [8] of the bv formalism, gauge-
xing was introduced by means of hypergauge functions depending on the entire set of
eld-antield variables. the hypergauge functions enter the quantum action in linear
combinations with the corresponding lagrange multipliers, and are subject to certain
involution relations expressed in terms of the same antibracket operation that occurs in
the generating equation determining the quantum action. these involution relations serve
to ensure the brst invariance of the vacuum functional, thus providing eectively for its
independence from hypergauge variations of canonical form in the antibracket sense.

in this paper we consider another generalization of the bv quantization scheme ob-
tained by modifying the supereld formalism [5] in such a way that the gauge is now
introduced with the help of a gauge-xing bosonic functional which depends generally on
the entire set of variables of the formalism, including sources and lagrange multipliers,
and which is subject to a generating equation formally analogous to the equation deter-
mining the quantum action. on the one hand, this approach to gauge-xing guarantees

the independence of the vacuum functional (and, hence, that of the s-matrix) from any
particular choice of the gauge. on the other hand, within this framework, as compared
to that of [8], we are no longer conned to linear dependence on the elds of lagrange
multipliers. remarkably, the generating equation introducing the gauge admits of a so-
lution which is identical with the gauge-xing functional found in the original version of
[5], and which, in particular, includes the well-known gauge-xing condition of the bv
formalism.

our starting point at the classical level is a general gauge theory with the well-known
structure of the conguration space a, (a) = a, described by the rules [6], depending
on whether the theory is a reducible or irreducible one.

we use the condensed notations [9] and the conventions adopted in [5].

2. modied supereld brst quantization

in this section we shall extend the procedure [5] of supereld quantization underlied by
the principle of brst invariance. we rst introduce a superspace (x, ) spanned by
space-time coordinates x,  = (0, 1, . . . , d  1), and a scalar anticommuting coordinate
. let a() be a set of superelds, which is accompanied by a set of the corresponding
super-antields 
a) = a + 1, and is
subjected to the boundary condition

a() with the grassmann parities (a)  a, (

a()|=0 = a.

we dene the vacuum functional z as the following functional integral:

z = z d d[] exp(cid:26) i

h(cid:18)w [, ] + x[, ] + (cid:19)(cid:27).

here, w = w [, ] is the quantum action which obeys the generating equation

1
2

(w, w ) + v w = ihw,

(1)

(2)

(3)

while the (bosonic) gauge-xing functional x = x[, ] is required to satisfy the equa-
tion

1
2

(x, x)  ux = ihx.

(4)

in eqs. (3), (4), we have used the antibracket ( , ) expressed in terms of arbitrary

functionals f = f [, ], g = g[, ] by the rule [5]

(f, g) = z d(cid:26) f

a()




g
a()



(1)a+1  (1)((f )+1)((g)+1)(f  g)(cid:27).

we have also used the operators , u and v

(derivatives with respect to  are understood as acting from the left) as well as the
functionals [] and , i.e.

[] = (cid:18)z d()(cid:19),
 = z d

a()a().

(9)

(10)

the algebraic properties of both the antibracket (5) and the operators (6), (7), (8)

were studied in detail in [5]. the algebra of the above operators has the form

2 = 0, u 2 = 0, v 2 = 0,

uv + v u = 0, u + u = 0, v + v  = 0.

it is convenient to recast the equations (3), (4) into the equivalent form

h

 exp(cid:26) i
 exp(cid:26) i

h

w(cid:27) = 0,
x(cid:27) = 0,

using the operators

 =  +

i
h

v,  =

u,

whose algebra, by virtue of the properties (11), (12), reads as follows:

2 = 0, 2 = 0,   +   = 0.

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

using the nilpotency of the operator u, we observe that any functional x = u[],
with [] being an arbitrary fermionic functional, is obviously a solution of eq. (4). the
above expression gives the precise form of the gauge-xing functional proposed by the
study of [5] when formulating the rules of supereld brst quantization.

a remarkable property of the integrand in (2) is its invariance under the following

transformations of global supersymmetry with an anticommuting parameter :

a() = ua() + (a(), x  w ),

a(), x  w ).

a() = v 

a() + (

second, the invariance of the weight functional (9) under the transformations (17), [] =

(w + x + ) = 2(cid:18)1

and, nally, the fact that the corresponding jacobian y has the form

y = exp(2w  2x).

(18)

(19)

eqs.
(17) are the transformations of brst symmetry in the framework of supereld
quantization based on the gauge-xing functional x introduced as a solution of the cor-
responding generating equation (4).

we now consider the gauge-dependence of the vacuum functional z, eq. (2). note, in
the rst place, that any admissible variation x of the gauge-xing functional x should
satisfy the equation

which can be represented in the form

(x, x)  ux = ihx,

here, we have introduced the graded linear, nilpotent operator q(x),

bq(x)x = 0.

bq(x) = bb(x)  ih ,

bq2(x) = 0,

where bb(x) stands for an operator acting by the rule
(x, f )  bb(x)f,
bb2(x) = bb(cid:18)1

and possessing the property

(x, x)(cid:19) .

2

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

by the nilpotency of the operator bq(x), any functional of the form

x = bq(x),

with  being an arbitrary fermionic functional, obeys the equation (21). furthermore,
as in the theorems proved by the study of [10], one can establish the fact that any solution
x of eq. (21), vanishing when all the variables entering x are equal to zero, has the
form (25), with a certain fermionic functional .

let zx  z be the value of the vacuum functional (2) related to the gauge condition
chosen as a functional x. in the vacuum functional zx+x we now make the change of
variables (17) with a functional  = [, ], accompanied by an additional change

a = (a, y ),

where y = ih[, ]. we obtain



a = (

a, y ),

(y ) = 1,

zx+x = z d d[] exp(cid:26) i

h(cid:18)w + x + x + x1 + (cid:19)(cid:27) .

4

(26)

(27)

in (27), we have denoted

x1 = 2(cid:18)(x, y )  uy  ihy(cid:19) = 2bq(x)y.

let the functional y be chosen in the form (recall that x = bq(x))

y = 

.

1
2

thereby we nd

zx+x = zx,

(28)

(29)

(30)

which implies the fact that the vacuum functional (and, hence, the s-matrix, by the
equivalence theorem [11]) does not depend on the gauge.

3. discussion

in the previous section we have extended the supereld quantization method [5] for gen-
eral gauge theories to encompass the concept of gauge-xing introduced by means of an
appropriate generating equation (see (4)).

the method of the modied supereld brst quantization permits one to generalize
the bv quantization scheme [6] as far as the procedure of gauge-xing is concerned. in
fact, consider the component representation of the superelds a() and super-antields


a()

a() = a + a, 

(a) = (ja) = a,

(

a() = 

a  ja,
a) = (a) = a + 1.

the set of variables a, 
bv method [6].

a, a, ja is identical with the complete set of variables of the

expressed in the component form, the antibracket (5) and the operator  (6) coincide

with the corresponding objects of the bv method [6]

(f, g) =

f
a

g

a

 (1)((f )+1)((g)+1)(f  g) ,

.

representing the integration measure in terms of the components

d d [] = d d d dj (j),

we observe that solutions of the generating equations determining the action w when
ja = 0 may be sought among solutions of the master equation applied by the bv method

since the operator v (7)

1
2

(w, w ) = ihw,

v = ja



a

5

(31)

vanishes when ja = 0. restricting ourselves to functionals w independent of a, and
taking into account the component form of , i.e.

we arrive at the following representation of the vacuum functional in eq. (2):

 = 

aa  jaa,

z = z d d d exp(cid:26) i

h(cid:20)w (, ) + x(, , ) + 

aa(cid:21)(cid:27).

(32)

the above result may be considered as an extention of the bv quantization procedure
[6] to a more general case of gauge-xing. in fact, as stated above, the functional x =
u[] is a solution of the generating equation (4). from the component representation
of the operator u

u = (1)aa l

a ,

provided the functional  is independent of the elds a,  = (), it follows that the
gauge-xing functional x

x(, ) = 

()
a a

becomes identical with the gauge applied by the bv quantization method.

it is instructive to compare the general framework of the present study with that of
the multilevel formalism [8]. notice that in writing down the relations of [8] we apply the
notations of the present paper, thereby assuming an explicit separation of eld-antield
variables in terms of the darboux coordinates.

if one assumes the measure density of the functional integration to be trivial, the

general ansatz for the rst-level vacuum functional [8] reads as follows:

z = z d d d exp(cid:26) i

h(cid:20)w (, ) + ga(, )a(cid:21)(cid:27),

(33)

where w (, ) is a quantum action subject to the generating equations (31), while
ga(, ) are gauge-xing functions, or hypergauge functions, according to the termi-
nology of [8].

the hypergauge functions ga = ga(, ) are assumed [8] to satisfy the involution

relations

ab,
accompanied by the so-called unimodularity conditions

(ga, gb) = gcu c

ga  u b

ba(1)b = gbv b

a , v a

a = ga ga

(34)

(35)

with certain structure functions u c

ab, v b

a , ga.

as shown in [8], the set of the conditions (34), (35), combined with the generating
equation (31), serves to ensure the invariance of the vacuum functional (33) under the
brst transformations

a = (a, w  gbb),



a = (

a = (cid:16)u a

bccb(1)b  2ihv a

a, w  gbb),
b b  2(ih)2 ga(cid:17) ,

(36)

6

which, in their turn, provide for the independence of the vacuum functional from hyper-
gauge variations of canonical form

ga = (ga, y ),

(y ) = 1.

(37)

it should be noted that the above variation (37) is compatible with the conditions (34),
(35). within the assumption that the hypergauge functions are solvable with respect to
the antields, the rst-level vacuum functional (33) reduces to the well-known form [6] of
the bv formalism.

in view of the above, we now return to the vacuum functional (32) of the modied
supereld formalism and consider the particular case of linear dependence of the gauge-
xing functional x(, , ) on the lagrange multipliers, i.e.

then, rstly, equation (4) determining x reduces to the conditions

x(, , ) + 

aa  ga(, )a.

(ga, gb) = 0, ga = 0,

(38)

and, secondly, the transformations of brst symmetry for the vacuum functional (32)
take on the form

a = (a, gbb  w ), 

a = (

a, gbb  w ), a = 0,

(39)

which follows from (17) when ja = 0.

obviously, equations (38), are identical with (34), (35) in the particular case of vanish-
a , ga, whereas the transformations (39), similarly, present

ab, v b

ing structure functions u c
a particular case of (36).

note also that there is a close connection between the result (32), obtained as a by-
product of our generalization of the supereld quantization [5], and a generalization of
the vacuum functional of the bv-formalism proposed by the study of [12]. in [12] it was
shown that the vacuum functional

z = z d d d exp(cid:26) i

h(cid:20)w (, ) + x(, , )(cid:21)(cid:27),

(40)

with both functionals w and x subject to the master equation of the bv-formalism

exp{(i/h)w } = 0,

exp{(i/h)x} = 0,

does not depend on the choice of the gauge functional.
x  = x + 
terms of x , the functional (32) coincides with the one proposed by [12].

it is clear that the functional
aa in (32) obeys the master equation exp{(i/h)x } = 0, and therefore, in

summarizing, both the study of the present paper and that of [8] apply gauge-xing
conditions depending on the whole set of eld-antield variables; they both contain the
bv method as a particular case and ensure the gauge-independence of the s-matrix. at
the same time, in the present approach the gauge-independence is encoded in brst
transformations controlled by generating equations imposed on the entire gauge part of
the quantum action, whereas in the framework of [8] this role is played by unimoduar
involution relations imposed on hypergauge functions. despite the formal similarity be-
tween the vacuum functional (32) proposed by the present study and the ansatz (33)
suggested by [8] the two methods appear to be independent from each other, being dif-
ferent generalizations of the bv method. however, as is seen from the above comparison,
the vacuum functional (32) proposed by the present study becomes identical, in the par-
ticular case of linear dependence on the lagrange multipliers, with the rst-level vacuum
functional [8] considered in the case of a trivial integration measure and vanishing struc-
ture functions. on the other hand, the vacuum functional (32) can be regarded as a
formal extension of (33) in the sense that it admits of more than linear dependence on
the lagrange multipliers.
