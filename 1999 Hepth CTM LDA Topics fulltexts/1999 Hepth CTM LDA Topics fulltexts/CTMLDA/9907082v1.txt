1 introduction

the construction of o-shell supergravity theories is up to date a complicated task. al-
though useful and in a limited sense powerful techniques have been developed, setting up
a locally supersymmetric lagrangian is still a very painful work. our motivation for such
a tedious project is twofold.

first, we note that o-shell formulations are known for d = 4, n = 1 [1, 2] and [3],
d = 4, n = 2 [4, 5, 6] and for d = 6, n = 2 [7]. further results are known on conformal
supergravity, e.g. d = 4, n = 4 [8]. clearly, there is a gap in ve dimensions. with
this work we would like to contribute to its closure. partial results in this direction were
obtained in [9, 10] where the n = 2 and n = 4 theories in ve dimensions were analyzed
using superspace methods.
in particular, the eld content of the current multiplet was
derived and constraints for the superspace torsion were suggested. a somehow related
work is [11]. although these papers explain how to construct the theory in question,
explicit formulae are missing. we will follow in large parts their suggestions and derive the
complete o-shell supergravity theory. a more complete analysis which should include the
development of a multiplet calculus is left for the future.

secondly, horava and witten conjectured that the low energy limit of the strongly
coupled heterotic e8  e8 string is described by eleven dimensional supergravity compact-
ied on s1/z2 [12, 13]. anomaly cancellation requires ten dimensional super yang-mills
multiplets with gauge group e8 on each boundary. in their papers horava and witten
construct the corresponding lagrangian as a perturbation series in 2/3
11 , where 11 is the
eleven dimensional gravitational coupling constant. they nd that at the order 4/3
11 terms
proportional to (x11)2 appear and so they terminate their expansion. consequently, their
lagrangian is not supersymmetric to all orders in 11. motivated by their work, mirabelli
and peskin investigated ve dimensional super yang-mills theory on s1/z2 coupled to
chiral multiplets which live on the four dimensional boundaries of this orbifold [14]. they
developed an economic method for constructing completely supersymmetric actions on
such spaces, at least for the globally supersymmetric case. their method heavily relies
on o-shell formulations, that is, in order to generalize their construction to local super-
symmetry an o-shell formulation of this theory is needed. of course, it would be most
interesting to apply there method to 11 dimensional supergravity. unfortunately there is
no o-shell formulation of this theory available so that the method of mirabelli and peskin
is not applicable. more promissing seems the construction of the corresponding action in
ve dimensions, i.e. ve dimensional supergravity compactied on s1/z2 where various
matter multiplets live on the four dimensional boundaries. this action may be viewed as a
toy model or, more ambitious, as a part of the eective ve dimensional action as obtained
by lukas et al. by reducing the 11 dimensional theory to ve dimensions [15].

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we construct the neccessary multiplets.
starting from super yang-mills theory we derive the multiplet of currents in section 2.1,
from which the linearized minimal supergravity multiplet is deduced, section 2.2 .
in
section 2.3 these results are supercovariantized, yielding the full minimal multiplet. a
further ingredient to our construction is the nonlinear multiplet which is constructed in

gauge degrees of freedom are subtracted.

section 2.4. we then move on and construct a physically sensible lagrangian, the main result
of this paper, which is given in section 3. short conclusions and comments are collected
in section 4. in the appendix a detailed explanation of our notations and conventions is
given.

2 multiplets

let us start by analyzing the necessary degrees of freedom. this is most easily done by
considering the outcome of a dimensional reduction from ve to four dimensions. the
on-shell supergravity multiplet in ve dimensions contains the vielbein ea
m, the gravitino
m and the graviphoton am. reducing this multiplet one nds a four dimensional n = 2
supergravity multiplet and an n = 2 maxwell multiplet. the necessary o-shell eld
content of these multiplets is easily found (see e.g. [16, 4]): the d = 4, n = 2 supergravity
multiplet contains 40 + 40 components and the corresponding super yang-mills multiplet
contains 8 + 8 components. so we conclude that the minimal o-shell supergravity in ve
dimensions requires at least 48 + 48 components.

however, as in four dimensions it is possible to nd a smaller multiplet on which the
supersymmetry algebra closes: the so called minimal multiplet. this four dimensional
multiplet has been constructed in [16] using superspace methods. in ve dimensions the
linearized version of this multiplet is the one which couples minimally to the multiplet of
currents. the latter is easily constructed and using the knowledge of the precise form of
the coupling term one can easily deduce the linearized transformation laws of the mini-
mal multiplet. knowing the linearized transformation laws, the construction of the full
transformation laws of the minimal multiplet is then straightforward. the elds belonging
to this multiplet are listed in table 1. it is possible to give an invariant action for this
multiplet. however, as expected from the counting of degrees of freedom, this action turns

3

out to be unphysical. an example being the existence of an auxilliary scalar c of (mass-)
dimension 7/2 for which the action reads

s 

1

z d5x ec.

here  is the gravitational coupling with dimension 3/2 and e = det ea
m is the determinant
of the vielbein. varying this action w.r.t. c one nds as equation of motion the meaningless
equation det ea

m = 0.

the solution of this problem is similar to the solution of the same problem in four
dimensional conformal supergravity [17]. the idea is simple: construct a multiplet which
is supersymmetric if a constraint of the form

c + av a + . . . = 0

(2.1)

is satised. here va belongs to this multiplet. take this constraint as dening relation
for c and replace c everywhere using this equation. now the resulting invariant may
be interpreted as supergravity action. a multiplet with a constraint of this form is the
nonlinear multiplet. furthermore, it contains 8 + 8 degrees of freedom, so that together
with the minimal multiplet 48 + 48 eld components are provided, verifying the counting
of degrees of freedom in the beginning of this section.

2.1 the multiplet of currents

in this section we construct the multiplet of currents in ve dimensions. this multiplet
has been discussed previously in superspace [10], see also [9].

we start from on-shell abelian super yang-mills theory in ve dimensions. this theory
contains the photon aa (with eld strength fab = 2[aab]), the gaugino  and a scalar .

the noether currents of this theory are easily constructed by standard methods. they

supersymmetry transformations (2.3),

these currents are conserved, i.e.

aj a = aab = a ~j a = 0

if the eld equations (2.4) are satised.

it is now straightforward to construct the complete multiplet of currents. from [10] we
know that the lowest dimensional component of this multiplet is a scalar c  with dimension
three. we start by writing down the most general ansatz bilinear in elds for which the
dimensions match and which is gauge invariant, i.e. c   2. then acting repeatedly with
the transformations (2.3) on this eld, always using the eld equations (2.4), one recovers
the complete multiplet:

besides the currents which we have already discussed, the remaining elds of the current
multiplet are the scalar c , a spinor , an su(2) triplet and lorentz scalar ~x and an
antisymmetric two form wab. these elds are dened by

(2.5)

the conservation of the currents ab, ~ja, ja and j a
(1) induces various gauge symmetries on
the elds they are coupled to. apart from the standard symmetries for the linearized
supergravity elds

hmn = mn + (m  n),

m = m,

am = m

(2.6)

there is an additional u(1)3 which follows from the conservation of ~j a. as a consequence,
~vm transforms as gauge eld,

 ~vm = m

~.

6

(2.7)

this u(1)3 will be knitted together with the global automorphism su(2) at order  to
give a local su(2). note that ~vm is an auxiliary eld so that the automorphism group of
the supersymmetry algebra will be gauged by an auxilliary eld. the invariance under the
second transformation in (2.6) allows us to add a term

m = m(

1
3

nan)

to the transformation law of the gravitino in (2.5) so that the last term in this expression
becomes the graviphoton eld strength. similarly, we add a transformation of the form
(2.7) to the tranformation law of ~vm in (2.5) to complete the rst term to the linearized
gravitino eld strength.

the multiplet which we have found here contains the 40 + 40 components mentioned

in the beginning of this section.

2.3 the full minimal multiplet

next, we let the supersymmetry parameter become a local quantity. consequently we
covariantize the transformation laws (2.5) w.r.t. local lorentz transformations, local su(2)
transformations and nally supercovariantize these formulas. then we calculate the algebra
on the elds. the closure of the algebra requires various additional terms of order  and
higher. the transformation rules we nd are

where q, g.c., lt, r, u (1) represent supersymmetry, general coordinate, local lorentz,
local su(2) and local2 u(1) transformations, respectively. the expressions in the brackets
give the parameters of the transformations in question.

we have calculated the algebra on ea

m, m, am, ~vm, vab,~t and . we have not veried
the closure on c. but from the algebra on the other elds it follows, that no freedom to
add further terms to the transformation law of any eld is left.

(2.10)

of course, this can only be a rst step towards a physical action since, as stated in the
beginning of this section, the eld equation for c is the unphysical det ea
m = 0. further
there is no kinetic term for the gravitino, etc. it is obvious that something like this must
happen since the multiplet presented here contains only 40+40 degrees of freedom whereas
we know from the analysis in the beginning of this section that an adequate multiplet, i.e.
one which allows for a physical lagrangian must contain (at least) 48 + 48 components.
this is very similar to the result in four dimensions [16].

2the graviphoton is the gauge eld for the u (1) and the only eld which transforms under this sym-

metry.

is due to the constraint (2.11).

2.4 the nonlinear multiplet

to resolve the problems stated at the end of the last section we have to introduce a further
multiplet, the nonlinear multiplet. the name comes from the fact that the transformation
rules are nonlinear in the elds which belong to this multiplet. our nonlinear multiplet is
the ve dimensional poincare variant of the superconformal nonlinear multiplet in six and
four dimensions described in [7, 17].

the scalar i

the nonlinear multiplet contains 8+8 components. they are listed in table 2. together
with the 40+40 components of the last section they will make up the supergravity multiplet.

.

the i
 allows the conversion of local su(2) indices to global ones. it is needed to construct
a gauge equivalent formulation where the local su(2) is broken explicitly as will be done
in the next section.

the nonlinear multiplet is also the starting point for o-shell supergravity with gauged
su(2), i.e. where ~vm is replaced by a propagating eld. this has been worked out for
the four dimensional case in [18]. to construct this theory, the global su(2) (acting on
the index ) is gauged by introducing a super yang-mills multiplet [19]. furthermore,
by identifying an so(2) subgroup of the gauged su(2) with the u(1) for which the
graviphoton is the gauge eld yields supergravity with a cosmological constant, i.e. ads
supergravity. the details are explained for the four dimensional case by de wit et al. in
[17].

counting components of the nonlinear multiplet one nds that a bosonic constraint is
needed to get equal numbers of fermionic and bosonic components. the required constraint
is of the form discussed in the beginning of section 2, eq.(2.1).

we have constructed this multiplet by starting with an ansatz which is motivated from

9

the literature [17, 7]:

3 lagrangians

it is now easy to write down a physically sensible action. we take the constraint of the

in this paper we have constructed minimal o-shell poincare supergravity in ve dimen-
sions. we started from a globally supersymmetric on-shell theory from which we con-
structed the associated multiplet of currents. by dualization we were able to deduce the
linearized transformation laws of the minimal multiplet. we then constructed the full
transformation laws which are very similar to the result of breitenlohner and sohnius [16].
as already found in this work such multiplets are not suited for the construction of physi-
cal actions. extending their work we resolved this problem using the nonlinear multiplet,
which is known from n = 2 conformal supergravity in four dimensions [17]. our nal
lagrangian is (3.6) and the transformation laws under which it is invariant are given in
eqns. (3.8).

acknowledgments:

it is a pleasure to thank p. breitenlohner and a. van proeyen
for helpful comments. furthermore i would like to thank j. conrad, h.-p. nilles and
especially s. forste.

this work was partially supported by the european commission programs erbfmrx-

ct96-0045 and ct96-0090.

a notations and conventions

our metric is ab = diag(+    ) and a, b = 0, . . . 4 are lorentz indices whereas
m, n = 0, . . . 4 are world indices . the dirac matrices satisfy the cliord algebra

{a, b} = 2ab.

antisymmetrization is with strength one, i.e.

(n) = a1...an = [a1a2 . . . an] =

1

n! xperms

(1)pa1 . . . an

and the sum is over all permutations. the gamma matrices are chosen to satisfy

a1...a5 = a1...a5,

where the levy-civita symbol is totally antisymmetric and (with at indices)

01234 = 01234 = 1.

14

now we can give the duality relation for the gamma matrices:

a1...ap =

p

(5  p)!

a1...apb1...b5pb1...b5p,

p =(cid:26) 1

+1

for p = 2, 3
for p = 0, 1, 4, 5

.

spinors carry an su(2) index i = 1, 2. the dirac conjugate is dened by

i  (i)0.
we can impose a symplectic majorana condition,

i = ij(j)t c,

where the charge conjugation matrix satises
c = c t = c 1,

a = cac 1.
t

if possible we suppress the su(2) indices. in this case the summation of these indices is
from southwest to northeast, e.g.

a  iai,

~ a  iaj(~ )i

j

(a.1)

with (~ )i
representation of su(2). a basic and rather useful identity is

j being the standard pauli matrices and the arrow generally denotes the vector

ia1 . . . anj = ikjllan . . . a1k,
from which one easily deduces the symmetry of fermion bilinears:

(n) = n

(n),

n =(cid:26) 1

+1

for n = 0, 1, 4, 5
for n = 2, 3

,

and for an additional pauli matrix, as for example in the second formula of (a.1), an
additional minus sign has to be included. for four spinors , , ,  the fierz identity is

( imj)( knl) = 
where m and n are arbitrary (combinations of) -matrices.

our spin-connection may be expressed as

with the coecents of anholonomy

mab = mba + abm  mab

a = [nea

the denition of supercovariance is standard: the supersymmetry transformation of
a supercovariant object contains no derivatives of the transformation parameter. this is

15

achieved by adding appropriate combinations of gravitinos. supercovariance is indicated
by a hat on the quantity in question. for example, the supercovariant graviphoton eld
strength is

fmn = fmn +

3i
2

mn

with

fmn = man  nam.

(a.2)

another example is the supercovariantized spin connection,

mab = mab +

( mba  amb + bam).

in section 3 we use a modied spin connection

mab = mab
