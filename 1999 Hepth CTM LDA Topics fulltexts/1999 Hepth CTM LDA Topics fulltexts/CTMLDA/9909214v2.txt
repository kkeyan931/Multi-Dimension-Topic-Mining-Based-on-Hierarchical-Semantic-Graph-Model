abstract

we derive fully covariant expressions for scattering amplitudes of various closed and open
strings from dp-brane with constant background ux in all of its world-volume directions.
we then examine in detail these amplitudes and nd that they are consistent with ordinary
dirac-born-infeld action and the recent idea of sieberg and witten that relate ordinary and
non-commutative gauge elds. our calculation of scattering amplitude of two open and one
closed string states also indicates that going from ordinary to non-commutative space, both
multiplication rule and open string elds should undergo approperaite transformations. we
nd this transformation explicitly for multiplication rule of two open string elds. this rule
is not the same as the multiplication rule that appears in the denition of non-commutative
eld strength.

1 introduction

recent years have seem dramatic progress in the understanding of nonperturbative aspects
of string theory[1]. with these studies has come the realization that extended objects, other
than just strings, play an essential role. an important tool in these investigations has been
dirichlet branes[2]. d-branes are non-perturbative states on which open string can live,
and to which various closed strings including ramond-ramond states can couple.

another interesting aspect of d-branes is that in the presence of background ux the
world-volume of d-brane becomes non-commutative[3, 4, 5]. hence, at low energy the d-
brane dynamics may be described by non-commutative gauge theory. on the other hand,
it is known that the d-brane is properly described by dirac-born-infeld action with ap-
propriate background ux (see e.g., [6]). using this idea, sieberg and witten were able
to nd, among other things, an explicit dierential equation that relates non-commutative
gauge eld at dierent non-commutative two-form parameter[7]. one of the purpose of
this paper is that to check this dierential equation in perturbative string theory. to end
this, we integrate the dierential equation in a special path to write ordinary open string
elds that appear in dbi action in terms of their non-commutative elds for nite noncom-
mutative parameter. under replacing these transformations into the ordinary dbi action,
one ends up with an action which contains closed string elds corresponding to massless
closed string vertex operators[8], and non-commutative open string elds corresponding
to massless open string vertex operator[7]. hence, various interactions in this action can
be checked in perturbative string theory. our calculations of string theory contact terms
conrm the integrated form of the dierential equation.

one of the outcome of our calculations is that if one only replaces ordinary elds in
the dbi action in terms of their noncommutative counterparts, the resulting action is not
completely consistent with the contact terms of string theory scattering amplitudes. to
have an action that is fully compatible with string theory, one should transform ordinary
multiplication rule as well. scattering amplitude of two open and one closed string states
can x this transformation for multiplication of two open string states (see equation (14)).

the paper is organized as follows. in the following section we expand the dbi action to
produce various interaction involving one closed and one or two ordinary open string elds.
in section 3, we integrate the dierential equation, found in [7], to transform ordinary open
string elds to their noncommutative counterparts. from the resulting relation, we guess
a transformation for multiplication rule of two open string elds. this non-commutative
multiplication rule is not the one appearing in the denition of non-commutative eld
strength. in section 4, using the conformal eld theory technique, we calculate various
string theory amplitudes describing scattering of strings from the non-commutative d-
branes and show, among other things, that the contact terms of the string amplitudes are
fully consistent with the dbi action in which above transformations are used. we conclude
with a brief discussion of our results in section 5. appendix contains our conventions and

some useful comments on conformal eld theory propagators and vertex operators used in
our calculations.

2 dirac-born-infeld couplings

the world-volume theory of a single d-brane in type 0 theory includes a massless u(1)
vector aa and a set of massless scalars x i, describing the transverse oscillations of the brane
[9, 10]. the leading order low-energy action for these elds corresponds to a dimensional
reduction of a ten dimensional u(1) yang mills theory. as usual in string theory, there are
higher order  = 2
s corrections, where s is the string length scale. as long as derivatives
of the eld strengths (and second derivatives of the scalars) are small compared to s,
then the action takes a dirac-born-infeld form [11]. to take into account the couplings of
the open string states with closed strings, the dbi action may be extended naturally to
include background closed string elds, in particular, the metric, dilaton, kalb-ramond
and tachyon eld[12, 13]. in this case one arrives at the following world-volume action:

sbi = tpz dp+1 g(t )eqdet(egab + ebab + 22

s fab)

where the tachyon function is g(t ) = 1 + t /4 + 3t 2/32 +    [12]. here, fab is the abelian
eld strength of the world-volume ordinary gauge eld, while the metric and antisymmetric
tensors are the pull-backs of the bulk tensors to the d-brane world-volume, e.g.,

(1)

(2)

egab = gab + 2gi(a b)x i + gijax ibx j .

in general, the closed string elds are function of world-volume and transverse coordinates,
i.e., x a and x i respectively, however, for simplicity we assume they are just function of
x a.

in order to nd the interactions expected from the dbi action, we expand the action
for uctuations around g = , b = f abab,  = 0. the uctuations should
be normalized as the conventional eld theory modes which appear in the string vertex
operators. as a rst step, we recall that the graviton vertex operator corresponds to
string frame metric. hence, one should transform the einstein frame metric g to the
string frame metric g via g = e/2g. now with conventions of [14], the string mode
uctuations take the form

g =  + 2h
 = 2
b = f abab  2b
t = 2

2

aa =

x i =

with these normalizations, the pull back of the einstein frame metric becomes:

egab = ab(1 +

where the dots represents terms with two and more closed string elds.

to produce a vast array of interactions. we are mostly interested in the interactions linear
in the closed string uctuations, and linear or quadratic in the open string elds.

we begin with the linear couplings of the closed strings to the d-brane source itself

have one closed and two open string states,

3 from commutative to non-commutative space

taking into account that the open string vertex operators correspond to non-commutative
gauge elds[7], one should write the ordinary open string elds in terms of their non-
commutative counterparts. in [7] the dierential equation for non-commutative gauge eld
was found to be

 fab() =

1
4

cd(cid:16)2 fac  fbd + 2 fbd  fac
 ac  ( dd fab + d fab)  ( dd fab + d fab)  ac(cid:17) + o( f 3)

where the eld strength and  product were dened to be

fab = a ab  b aa  i aa  ab + i ab  aa

= a ab  b aa  i[ aa, ab]m

i

f(x)  g(x) = e

2 ab a

x  b

x f (x)g(x)|x=x=x .

(10)

(11)

scattering amplitudes in the next section reproduce dierent couplings for nite . there-
fore, to compare expected coupling of dbi action and string amplitude we should inte-
grate the dierential equation (10) to nd relation between ordinary eld strength, i.e.,
fab( = 0), and its noncommutative counterpart, i.e., fab(). we take the integral in the
special path that ab is proportional to a scalar, i.e., ab = ab, and take integral over 
from  = 0 to  = 1. the result is

fab = fab 

1
2

cd(cid:16) fac  fbd + fbd  fac  ac  d fab  d fab  ac(cid:17) + o( a3) (12)

4

where now the  product is dened to be

f(x)  g(x) =

e

i

i

2 ab a

x  b
2aba

x  1
xb
x

f (x)g(x)|x=x=x

(13)

to check the result, one may dierentiate it to get equation (10) up to order o( a3). now
if one compare equation (12) for innitesimal  and nite , one may conclude that to
go from ordinary product of two open string elds at  = 0 to nite  one should use the
following transformation as well:

f g|=0  f  g|6=0

(14)

where f and g are any arbitrary open string elds. we will see in the next section that
this multiplication rule is consistent with string theory scattering amplitudes of two open
and one closed string states.

now with the help of equation (12) and (14), one can write the dbi coupling (7), (8)
and (9) at  = 0 in terms of non-commutative elds at  6= 0 corresponding to open string
vertex operator. in doing so, one should rst using (14) replace ordinary multiplication of
two open string elds by the  multiplication. then, using (12), the ordinary elds are
shifted to their non-commutative counterparts. for example, transformation of equation
(8) up to three open string states becomes

we now turn to string theory side and evaluate these couplings using the conformal eld
theory technique.

4 scattering calculations

in this section, we calculate various string scattering amplitudes. the amplitude describing
scattering of two closed strings from d-brane with a background magnetic ux was calcu-
lated in [8]. there by analyzing the t-channel of the amplitude, we were able to nd the
linear coupling of closed string elds to the d-brane and to show that they are consistent
with the coupling in (5).

5

4.1 closed-open couplings

here, we wish to compare the coupling of one massless non-commutative open string eld
and one closed string eld on the d-brane to the results of the appropriate string couplings.
in eld theory, this coupling can be read from eq. (7) and the transformation (12). in string
theory side, on the other hand, this coupling is given by the string scattering amplitude of
one open and one closed string state from the d-brane, that is,

ans,nsns  z dx1 d2z2 < v ns(k1, 1, x1) v closed(p2, 2, z2, z2) > .

(16)

the details of the vertex operators appear in the appendix. we already assumed in sec. 2
that the closed string elds in the dbi action (1) are independent of transverse coordinates.
in string theory side, it means that the momentum of closed string vertex operators have
component only in the world-volume directions, i.e., pi = 0. the techniques in calculating
the above string scattering amplitude may be found in refs. [15, 14, 16]. the nal result is

ans,nsns = qtpc

 matrices coming from closed and open string vertices, respectively(see

appendix). we have also normalized the amplitudes at this point by iqtpc/2, where
1/qtp,  and tpc are open string, closed string and d-brane coupling constants, respec-

tively. substituting the appropriate polarizations for the open and closed string elds from
the appendix, one nds

a(, h) = qtpc(cid:16)1n2v tk1 + k1v t2n1(cid:17)
a(a, h) = qtpc(cid:16)1v2vk1  k1v2v1 + k1va1tr(2v t )(cid:17)
a(a, ) = qtpc
22
(1vvk1  k1vv1 + k1va1(tr(v )  4))
a(a,  ) = qtpc

k1va1

where here and in the scattering amplitudes in subsequent sections h stands for both
graviton and kalb-ramond elds. in writing above equations, we have used the on-shell
condition k1vs1 = 0(see appendix) and momentum conservation ka
2 = 0. these terms
are reproduced by the following action:

(17)

this is consistent with the dbi interaction (7) and the transformation (12) up to two open
string elds. note that transformation of a can be read from dimensional reduction of
(12).

4.2 open-open-open couplings

next, we turn to the coupling of three open string states. in string theory side this coupling
is given by

an s,n s,n s  z dx1dx2dx3 < v n s(1, k1, x1) v n s(2, k2, x2) v n s(3, k3, x3) >

where the appropriate vertex operators are given in the appendix. using the world-sheet
conformal eld theory, it is not dicult to perform the correlators above and show that
the integrand is invariant under sl(2, r). fixing this symmetry, one nds

a =

c sin(l)

qtp

(k1ggt3 1ggt2 + k3ggt2 1ggt3  k3ggt 1 2ggt3)

where we have dened l  2k1v tfv k2 = 2k1vak2 and va is antisymmetric part
of the v matrix (6). we have also normalized the amplitude by the appropriate coupling
factor c/2qtp. the sin(l) factor above arises basically from two dierent phase factors

corresponding to two distinct cyclic orderings of the vertex operators. each phase factor
steam from the second terms of the world-sheet propagator (48). using polarization for
scalar and gauge eld, one nds the following non-vanishing terms:

a(, , a) =

a(a, a, a) =

c sin(l)

c sin(l)

qtp
qtp

1n2 k1vs3

(1vs2 3vsk1 + 2vs3 1vsk2 + 1vs3 2vsk3)

(18)

where vs is the symmetric part of the v matrix (6). these couplings may be reproduced
by

(19)

where the moyal bracket is dened in (11) and the  operates on the whole moyal bracket.
this x the relation between the noncommutative two-form in (11) and the background
metric and ux to be

ab = 4v ab

a .

7

(20)

the dbi interaction (8) and the transformations (14) and (12), reproduce various terms
having two, three and more open string elds. terms which have three elds contain
two dierent parts. one part is just above action and the other part which have three
momentum may be veried to be zero. in action (19), one may use , instead of , another
multiplication rule, e.g., ordinary multiplication [17] or  multiplication [7], all produce the
same momentum space couplings(18). hence, although above calculations of three open
string couplings can x the non-commutative multiplication rule in the denition of eld
strength,i.e., , it can not however uniquely x the multiplication rule between two open
string eld strengths.

if one multiplies action (19) with a closed string eld, say tachyon, then the ordinary,
 and  and any other multiplication rule produce dierent momentum space couplings.
in this case, string theory calculations can be used to x uniquely the multiplication rule.
to x the multiplication rule between two open string elds, we calculate string theory
couplings of two open and one closed string states in the momentum space. these can be
extracted from string scattering amplitudes of two open and one closed string states from
the non-commutative d-brane which we now turn to calculate them.

4.3 closed-open-open amplitudes

scattering amplitude of one closed and two open string states can be related to the appro-
priate amplitude of four open string states in type i theory[14, 15]. however, type i theory
does not have open string tachyon, so the scattering amplitude describing the decay of two
massless open string to one closed string tachyon in type 0 is not related to the known
amplitude in type i theory. so we explicitly calculate the tachyon amplitude, while using
the idea in [14, 15] we nd the massless closed string amplitude from the known amplitude
of type i theory.

4.3.1 tachyon amplitudes

the amplitudes describing interaction of one closed string tachyon and two massless open
strings is given by

an s,n s,  z dx1dx2d2z < v n s(1, k1, x1)v n s(2, k2, x2)v  (p3, z3) >

where the closed and open string vertex operators are given in the appendix. here again
using appropriate world-sheet propagators from [14], one can evaluate the correlations
above and show that the integrand in sl(2, r) invariant. gauging this symmetry by
xing z3 = i and x2 = , one arrives at

a  22s2z dx1 (2s + 1)1ggt2

2i1gp3 2gdtp3

x1 + i

!

8

(x1  i)sl(x1 + i)s+l

where the integral is taken from  to +, and s = (p3v t )2 = 2k1vsk2. this integral
is doable and the result is

a = 

ic
2

(a1(s + l)  a2(s  l))

(2s)

(1  s  l)(1  s + l)

(21)

where a1 and a2 are two kinematic factors depending only on the space time momentum
and polarization vectors

a1 = 1gdtp32gp3
a2 = (s + l)1ggt2 + 1gp32gdtp3 .

we have also normalized the amplitude (21) at this point by the coupling factor ic/2. a
check of our calculations is that the amplitude (21) satises the ward identity associated
with the gauge invariance of the open string states, i.e., the amplitude vanishes upon
substituting ia  kia. this amplitude has the pole structure at m2

open = n/1.

4.3.2 ns-ns amplitudes

next, we evaluate the amplitude describing the decay of two massless open ns strings
into one massless closed nsns state. using the idea in [14, 15], we relate this amplitude
to amplitude of four massless open ns strings. hence, we begins with the closed string
amplitude which is given by

a z dx1 dx2 d2z3 < v ns(k1, 1, x1) v ns(k2, 2, x2) v nsns(p3, 3, z3, z3) > .

(22)

if one evaluated the above correlators, one would nd that the integrand is sl(2, r)
invariant. similar to the tachyon amplitude, the appropriate way to x this gauge would
be to x operators at {z3, x1, z3, x2} = {i, y, i,}.

to relate the calculation here to that of a four point amplitude of open superstrings[18],

we write the latter in sl(2, r) invariant form, that is

a  z dx1dx2dx3dx4 x4k1k2

where is are the polarization of external states. since we are interested in this amplitude
for transforming it to scattering amplitude of one closed and two open string states, we do
not consider the phase factor associated with the second term of propagator (48). if one
xes the sl(2, r) symmetry by xing the operators at {x1, x2, x3, x4} = {1, x, 1,}, one

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

the integral (28) is doable and the result is the same as equation (21) with above kinematic
factors. as a check of our calculations, we have inserted the dilaton polarization (49) into
the kinematic factor and found that it is independent of the auxiliary vector . another
check is that the amplitude satises the ward identity associated with the gauge invariance
of the open string states.

4.3.3 massless poles

given the general form of the string amplitude in eq. (21), one can expand this amplitude as
an innite sum of terms reecting the innite tower of open string states that propagate on
the world-volume of d-brane. in the low energy domain, i.e., mopen << 1, the rst term
representing the exchange of massless string states dominates. in this case the scattering
amplitude (21) reduces to

a =

(a1 + a2) +

where dots represent contact terms and the innite massive poles. making the appropriate
explicit choices of polarizations, we nd

in writing explicitly the above massless poles, one nds some terms which is proportional
to s as well. we will add these terms which have no contribution to the massless poles
of eld theory to the contact terms in (35). these amplitudes should be reproduced in
s-channel of eld theory. we present the calculation explicitly for the decay of two gauge
elds into tachyon. this amplitude can be evaluated in eld theory as

a

s(a, a,  ) = (ev a)a(ega)ab(evaaa)b

in writing the above propagator from (9), we have used the covariant gauge v ab
replacing above propagator and vertices into (32), one nds exactly the string massless
pole as(a, a,  ). similar calculations for the other open string modes reproduces exactly
the corresponding massless poles of the string amplitudes (31).

although the whole string scattering amplitude (21) is gauge invariant, vanishing upon
substituting ia  kia, its massless pole (31) is not gauge invariant which can be checked
explicitly. so one expects that the low energy contact terms of string amplitude not to
be gauge invariant either. however, combination of the massless pole and contact terms
should be gauge invariant. we turn now to evaluate these low energy contact terms of
string amplitude (21)

4.3.4 contact terms

having examine in detail the massless poles of string amplitudes, we now extract the
low energy contact terms of the string amplitude (21). expanding the gamma function
appearing in this amplitude, one will nd

(34)

the factor sin(l)/(l) appears for all the contact terms. this indicates that multiplication
rule between any two open strings is . however, as we will see in a moment, some of the
terms in the kinematic factors a1 and a2 are proportional to l. hence, these terms have
overall factor of sin(l) which produce the non-commutative multiplication rule  instead of
 in eld theory. it is important to note that this higher order derivative terms associated
with  or  are not the ones that steams from massive pole of string amplitude. this
factors appear for both the low energy contact terms and the contact terms corresponding
to massive poles. terms in the rst line of (34) are the low energy massless pole and
contact terms, whereas the terms in the second line are eect of the massive poles of the
string amplitude (21).

12

as anticipated above, not all the low energy contact terms are gauge invariant. there-
fore, we separate the contact terms into gauge invariant and gauge non-invariant terms.
moreover, we divide the gauge non-invariant terms into two parts, terms which have, apart
from the overall factor, no momentum and two momenta. that is

ic sin(l)

in all above terms, the factor sin(l)/(l) reduces to sin(l) which produces  operator
between two open string elds. in fact it is not dicult to see that above terms exactly
reproduce by the following action:

plus (1  2) for equations that have two gauge elds. these gauge invariant terms are not
fully consistent with the dbi terms in (15). if one adds the following action to the dbi

(41)

now if one adds equation (17), (36), (38) and (41), one will nd exactly the dbi interactions
(7) in which using the transformation (12) with the normalization (3) the ordinary elds
are written in terms of their noncommutative counterparts up to three open string elds.
this ends our illustration of consistency between string theory scattering amplitude and
dbi action in which the transformations (12) and (14) are used.

5 discussion

having integrated the noncommutative dierential equation, found in [7], in a special
path, we write ordinary gauge eld in terms of non-commutative counterpart for nite
non-commutative two-form parameter. we then use this relation to express the ordinary
dbi action in terms of non-commutative elds. the resulting action was then conrmed
by comparing it with various string theory scattering amplitudes.

our calculations of string amplitude of two massless open and one closed string states
also indicate that, not only the open string elds but the multiplication rule of elds also
should be transformed from ordinary to non-commutative space. the transformation for
multiplication rule of two open string states was found in this paper to be (14). it would
be interesting to perform the calculation of one closed and three open string states to nd
transformation of multiplication rule of three open string states.

the scattering amplitudes considered in this paper x the relation between ordinary
and noncommutative elds up to three noncommutative elds. in principle, our method
can be extended to higher point functions to x other terms of this relation.

in section 4.2 we reach to the conclusion that string scattering amplitude (18) reproduce
the action (19) in eld theory. in [7], sieberg and witten conclude dierent action, i.e.,
similar to (19) with  instead of  operator. these two actions are identical up to some

15

total derivative terms. in fact, using the antisymmetric property of the non-commutative
parameter, one nds

up to some total derivative terms.

our calculations of string scattering amplitude of two open and one closed string states
from non-commutative d-brane are also original. using the two-dimensional conformal
eld theory, we performed calculations for scattering amplitude of two massless open string
states and one closed string tachyon explicitly. whereas, using the idea that scattering
amplitude of open and closed string states can be read from approperaite amplitude of
only open string states[14, 15], we were able to nd an expression for scattering amplitude
of two open and one massless closed string states from non-commutative d-branes.

a perturbative string theory with background eld

in perturbative superstring theories, to study scattering amplitude of some external string
states in conformal eld theory frame, one usually evaluate correlation function of their
corresponding vertex operators with use of some standard conformal eld theory propaga-
tors [19]. in trivial at background one uses an appropriate linear -model to derive the
propagators and dene the vertex operators. in nontrivial d-brane background the ver-
tex operator remain unchanged while the standard propagators need some modication.
alternatively, one may use a doubling trick to convert the propagators to standard form
and give the modication to the vertex operators[14]. in this appendix we would like to
consider a d-brane with constant gauge eld strength / or antisymmetric kalb-ramond
eld in all directions of the d-brane. the modications arising from the appropriate linear
-model appear in the following boundary conditions [9]2:

yx a  if a

bxx b = 0 for a, b = 0, 1,   p
i = p + 1,   9

x i = 0 for

(42)

where fab are the constant background elds, and these equations are imposed at y = 0.
the world-volume (orthogonal subspace) indices are raised and lowered by ab(n ij) and
ab(nij), respectively. now we have to understand the modication of the conformal eld
theory propagators arising from these mixed boundary conditions. to this end consider
the following general expression for propagator of x (z, z) elds:

< x (z, z) x (w, w) > =  log(z  w)   log(z  w)
d log(z  w)  d(z  w)

(43)

where d is a constant matrix. to nd this matrix, we impose the boundary condition
(42) on the propagator (43), which yields

ab  dba  f ab  f a

cdbc = 0

(44)

for the world-volume directions, dij = n ij for the orthogonal directions, and dia = 0
otherwise. now equation (44) can be solved for dab, that is

dab = 2(  f )(1)

ab  ab

= 2vba  ab

2 our notation and conventions follow those established in [14]. so we are working on the upper-half
plane with boundary at y = 0 which means y is normal derivative and x is tangent derivative. and our
index conventions are that lowercase greek indices take values in the entire ten-dimensional space-time,
e.g., ,  = 0, 1, . . . , 9; early latin indices take values in the world-volume, e.g., a, b, c = 0, 1, . . . , p; and
middle latin indices take values in the transverse space, e.g., i, j = p + 1, . . . , 8, 9. finally, our conventions
set 2

s =  = 2.

(45)
(46)

17

where matrix v is the dual metric that appears in the expansion of dbi action (6). note
that the d is orthogonal matrix, i.e., d

d = .

using two dimensional equation of motion, one can write the world-sheet elds in terms
of right- and left-moving components. in terms of these chiral elds, closed nsns and open
ns vertex operators are

v nsns = : vn(x(z), (z), (z), p) :: vm( x(z), (z), (z), p) :

v ns = : vn(x(x) + x(x), (x) + (x), (x) + (x), k) :

where  is super partner of world-sheet eld x  and  is world-sheet superghost eld.
the indices n, m refer to the superghost charge of vertex operators, and p and k are closed
and open string momentum, respectively. in order to work with only right-moving elds,
we use the following doubling trick:

x (z)  d

x (z)

(z)  d

(z)

(z)  (z) .

(47)

these replacements in eect extend the right-moving elds to the entire complex plane
and shift modication arising from mixed boundary condition from propagators to vertex
operators. under these replacement, world-sheet propagator between all right-moving elds
take the standard form [8] except the following boundary propagator:

< x (x1) x (x2) > =  log(x1  x2) +

i
2 f (x1  x2)

(48)

where (x1 x2) = 1(1) if x1 > x2(x1 < x2). note that the orthogonal property of the d
matrix is an important ingredient for writing the propagators in the standard form. the
vertex operators under transformation (47) becomes

v nsns = vn(x(z), (z), (z), p) :: vm(dx(z), d(z), (z), p) :
v ns = : vn(x(x) + dx(x), (x) + d(x), 2(x), k) :

.

the vertex operator for closed string tachyon, massless nsns and massless ns states are

v  = : vn(p, z) :: vm(pd, z) :
n (p, z) :: v 
n (2kv t , x) :

v nsns = (d) : v 
v ns = (g) : v 

m(pd, z) :

where gab = (ab + dab)/2 = v ba for gauge eld, gij = (ij  dij)/2 = n ij for scalar eld
and gai = 0 otherwise. the open string vertex operators in (0) and (1) pictures are

v 
0 (k, x) = (x (x) + ik(x) (x)) eikx(x)
v 
1(k, x) = e(x)(x)eikx(x)
v0(k, x) = ik(x)eikx(x)
v1(k, x) = e(x)eikx(x) .

18

the physical conditions for the massless open string are

kvsk = 0 , kvs = 0

and for massless closed string are p2 = 0 and p = 0 where  is the closed string
polarization which is traceless and symmetric(antisymmetric) for graviton(kalb-ramond)
and

(  p  p)

p = 1

for the dilaton. using the fact that d is orthogonal matrix, one nds the following
identities:

ggt = gs , (dgt )ab = gab , (dgt )ij = n ij

where the gs is symmetric part of the g matrix.
