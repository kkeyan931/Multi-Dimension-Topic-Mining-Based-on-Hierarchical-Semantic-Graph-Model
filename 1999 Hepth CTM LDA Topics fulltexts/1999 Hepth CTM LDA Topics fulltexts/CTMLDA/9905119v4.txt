abstract

the klein-gordon system describing three scalar particles without
interaction is cast into a new form, by transformation of the momenta.
two redundant degrees of freedom are eliminated; we are left with a
covariant equation for a reduced wave function with three-dimensional
arguments. this new formulation of the mass-shell constraints is equiv-
alent to the original kg system in a sector characterized by positivity
of the energies and, if the mass dierences are not too large, by a mod-
erately relativistic regime.
introducing mutual interactions provides a model which is (at least for
three equal masses) tractable and admits a reasonable nonrelativistic
limit.

pacs 11.10.qr relativistic wave equations

1 introduction

1.1 motivations

relativistic particle dynamics is concerned by situations where the par-
ticles we consider are not signicantly created or anihilated, whereas
other relativistic eects must be taken into account. in principle the
description of such particles should result from a specialization of quan-
tum eld theory (qft) to its n-body sector.
this line leads to the famous integral equation of bethe and salpeter
(bs) in the two-body case. three-body generalizations have soon been

1

considered in the litterature [1]. more recently see [2][3]. for n > 2 how-
ever, the complexity of the bs approach seems to be almost prohibitive
as far as practical applications are concerned.
an alternative approach, based upon rst principles [4] [5], uses n mass-
shell constraints in the form of coupled wave equations where interaction
terms can be either phenomenological or derived from qft [6]. this
method shares with bs equation the property of manifest relativistic
invariance, realized at the price of dealing with redundant degrees of
freedom, since the arguments of the wave function are four-vectors. in
the two-body case, there is a clue for eliminating the redundant degree
of freedom: the sum of wave equations rules the dynamics, whereas
their dierence allows to determine how the wave function depends on
the relative time. this dependence turns out to be trivial and one is
left with a three-dimensional problem.
in the three-body case we have to cope with two relative times. these
superuous degrees of freedom are present as well in the three-body ver-
sions of the bs equation. their elimination (or factorization) is desirable
for physical interpretation; it would produce (after diagonalization of the
total linear momentum) a reduced wave equation which is covariant but
similar to a schroedinger equation with three-dimensional arguments.
unfortunately, the simple procedure utilized in the two-body case does
not work for n > 2.

an important issue of n-body dynamics is cluster separability; but a
less restrictive and more essential requirement is global separability:
one must at least recover free-particle motion when all interactions are
put equal to zero. models violating global separability have been con-
sidered in the past [7][8], mainly for their computational simplicity, but
we belive that any reasonable formulation of n-body dynamics must in-
clude free motion as a limit when all the terms carrying interactions are
switched o.
in sofar as fermions are concerned, these matters have been discussed
earlier in the literature [9] [10].

for scalar particles with masses ma, free motion can be described by n
klein-gordon (kg) equations, say (p2
a)  = 0 where  depends
on the momenta p1, ....pn. we can give a sharp timelike value k to the
total linear momentum and use the dierences of these equations. in
the two-body case, it follows that the relative time (or alternatively the
relative energy
in a trivial factor of the wave function.
but this procedure is unable to produce any simplication as soon as n >
2. so we face this diculty that even for free particles, the usual form

(p1  p2)  k/k2, which is conjugate to it) arises only

c

a  m2

of the equations of motion fails to permit the elimination of superuous
degrees of freedom.
this point may seem to be academic, because a system of noninter-
acting particles has no bound state, which renders a three-dimensional
formulation unnecessary. but we bear in mind the eventuality of intro-
ducing interactions that ultimately give rise to bound states. therefore
the possibility of a reduction is essential and should survive in the free
case.

in this paper we focus on three-body systems and we rstly consider
the case of noninteracting particles. let us stress that the free system is
not considered on its own right, but rather as preliminary to the further
introduction of mutual interactions.

since the kg equations as they stand do not permit a factorization
of the dependence on relative times, it is natural to transform these
equations into an equivalent system such that two superuous degrees
of freedom can be desentangled from the kinematics.
an early attempt to carry out this task for an arbitrary number of par-
ticles was made by sazdjian [10][11] fteen years ago. here, however, we
shall be concerned with the 3-body case only, and shall take advantage
of a simplication that is not possible for n > 3.
our aim is to eliminate two degrees of freedom in such a way that
the mass-shell constraints reduce to a covariant problem with three-
dimensional arguments. ultimate introduction of interactions will be
briey sketched at the end. of course, the poincare invariance of kine-
matics must be preserved and all particles should be treated on equal
footing (democracy). these conditions are not likely to select a unique
scheme, but if we intend to make it as simple as possible, there are not
too many choices.
we perform a rearrangement of the individual coordinates (well known
in celestial mechanics) which is adapted to the consideration of relative
variables. we insist on having invertible formulas, which is necessary
in order to make sure that the new form of the equations of motion is
equivalent to the original kg system.

section 2 is devoted to an exposition of the notation used and of the
basic useful equations of relativistic dynamics. in section 3 we collect
known results and perform elementary manipulations.
in section 4, using the heliocentric variables, we construct in closed
form a transformation of the free-particle system and discuss under
which conditions this transformation is invertible.
in section 5, we
briey indicate how mutual interaction could be introduced.

moreover it is convenient to dene

beware that zab is not conjugate to yab. we obviously have the following
relations

x ya = 0,

ya  yb = (pa  pb) = 2yab

(5)

2yab + ya  yb = 0,

epa = eya

the tilde symbol denotes projection orthogonal to p , in other words
eza =  za, with  =   (p  p )/p 2. similarly, the hat
eya =  ya,
symbol refers to the projection orthogonal to k, eigenvalue of p . for
instance

a = y
ey
a = y
by

a  (ya  p/p 2) p 
a  (ya  k/k2) k

heliocentric variables
the problem of relative times cannot be easily handled unless we rst
choose a set of independent relative variables. for this end, one particle
is arbitrarily picked up; let it be particle with label one. with respect
to particle 1, the relative conguration variables are dened like in [7].

za = q1  qa

(6)

where the capital labels a, b, c run only from 2 to n. from (3) it follows
that za is conjugate to ya.

let us now specialize to three-body systems; we can write

y12 = y2 +

1
2

y3

y13 = y3 +

1
2

y2

z12 + z23 + z31 = 0

(7)

(8)

notice that eqs (1-5) hold true for any n, whereas (7)(8) are valid for
n = 3 only. it is clear that q, z2, z3 are independent conguration vari-
ables. in the same way p, y2, y3 are independent momentum variables,
canonically conjugate to them. we can use the set of canonical variables
q, z2, z3, p, y2, y3 in place of q1, q2, q3, p1, p2, p3, this change is trivial.
in this heliocentric formulation, democracy among the three particles
is of course not kept manifest but can be checked at various stages of
the development. a similar re-arrangement, showing up two relative
momenta, is of current use in (newtonian) celestial mechanics.

among the quantities pab we shall more specially need to evaluate
p12, p13. they are given by

p12 =

2
3

p + y3

p13 =

2
3

p + y2

(9)

we shall also need the canonical expression of y12, y13, given by (7).
it will be convenient to replace eqs (1) by their sum and their dierences;
to this end we dene

a =

1

(m2

so the equal-mass case is characterized by the vanishing of both 1, 2.

equations (1) can obviously be written

c2 x m2
a  m2

a  = x p2
b )c2 = (p2

a 
a  p2

(m2

notice that, according to notation (4)

(p2

in equation (10), let us use the identity

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

valid for any sum of n squares in a commutative algebra. we obtain

3x m2c2  = p 2  + x

a<b

(pa  pb)2 

(14)

in terms of the relative variables (see eq. (7)) we have another identity
specic of the three-body problem

x

a<b

(pa  pb)2  6(y2

2 + y2

3 + y2  y3)

(15)

now in the r.h.s. of (15) we separate time from space according to the
direction of p , and insert the result into (14). we get

x

a<b

(pa  pb)2 = d + 6p 2

where

d = 6(ey2

2 + ey2

3 + ey2  ey3)

 = (p 2)2[(y2  p )2 + (y3  p )2 + (y2  p )(y3  p )]

thus the sum of eqs (1) is

(3x m2c2  p 2)  = (d + 6p 2) 

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

the remaining combinations of (1) can easily be written as the dier-
ence equations

y12  p12  = 2c2 ,

y13  p13  = 3c2 

(20)

now it is natural to require that  is also eigenstate of the total mo-
mentum, say

p  = k

(21)

for some timelike constant vector k. but (in contrast to what happens in
the two-body case) this procedure is unable of getting rid of the relative

energies cya  k/k2 conjugate to the relative times c1 za  k/k2.

nevertheless, we can look for a new set of canonical variables; if these
variables are suitably choosen, equations (20) may after all result in the
elimination of two degrees of freedom.

a transformation in momentum space will be enough to induce the suit-
able transformation among operators. in fact we are going to construct
the quantum analog of a point transformation in momentum space (see
appendix 1).
let us start with a wave function (p1, p2, p3). perform a change in the
space of its arguments

with summation also over (repeated) capital indices. in these formulas
it is clear that the transformation of momenta must be invertible.
beware that q may not coincide with q because of y/p . in addition,
we observe that the new relative coordinates actually mix the old ones.
however, we shall prove later (section 5) that this diculty disappears
in the large-total-mass limit.

it is in order to stress that nding the desired transformation amounts
to solve a problem in the framework of c-numbers. the question of
inverting formulas, discussed below, is nothing but a nonlinear problem
concerning the arguments of the wave function. since it is specied that
we are dealing with momentum representation, we shall use without
confusion the same symbols for the arguments of the wave function and
the multiplicative operators they dene.

for a better understanding of the mathematical structure, it is perhaps
relevant to notice that q and z
a are formally hermitian in this sense
that they are symmetric operators in

l2(r12) = l2(r12, d4p d4y
whereas q and zb are symmetric operators in

2 d4y

in contrast the momenta are symmetric operators in both senses. for
mathematical convenience we shall work with a new wave function

indeed
2 maps l2 onto l2, so  (resp.  ) belongs to
multiplication by |j|
the rigged-hilbert space constructed by taking l2 (resp. l2) as hilbert
space. although l2 (resp. l2) has no direct physical meaning, it allows
for representing the poincare algebra and gives a rigorous status to the
operators involved in the wave equations.
since pa are multiplicative operators, they commute with j, so the mass-
shell constraints can be written either as (1) for  or equivalently in the
form (p2

ac2) = 0, with each pa expressed in terms of p
b.

in momentum space, the lorentz group is characterized by this property
that it leaves all the products pa  pb unchnged.
provided all the p
b can be expressed as functions of pc  pd and vice-
versa, the same realization of the lorentz group can be as well charac-
terized by invariance of all the scalar products pcpd. in such a situation,
although m  = p q  p may be distinct from m = p q  p, their com-
ponents span the same lie algebra. moreover j being conserved by
rotations, it follows that m and m  are both symmetric in l2 and also
in l2.
till now we have considered a large class of transformations, charac-
terized by equations (25)(26); the classical (non-quantum) limit of such
formulas would dene point transformations in momentum space.
we now specialize to a transformation which allows for eliminating the
superuous degrees of freedom. all we need is an invertible transforma-
tion such that

p12  y12 = p  y

p13  y13 = p  y

and just transform their time components in the way dictated by eqs
(27). this choice obviously preserves lorentz invariance; we shall prove
below that it does not destroy the democracy among particles.

in view of equation (32), and taking into account the identity

it is clear that our change of variables is essentially determined by (27).

in order to exhibit the transformation in closed form.

translation invariance was ensured from the outset by assuming that
p  = p .
lorentz invariance is preserved because all the quadratic scalar quanti-
ties formed with the vectors p, y2, y3 are scalar invariant under space-
time rotations.
democracy between particles is not manifest in the heliocentric nota-
tion. nevertheless it is not dicult to check that our way of transform-
ing momentum variables treats all three particles on the same footing.
indeed we rst observe that (32) entails ey
1 = ey1, which amounts to
nally write ey
a = eya for the three particles. then using (12) and (4) we
realize that (27) automatically imply a third relation p23  y23 = p  y
23.

4.2

inversion of formulas

now that all components of the new momenta p
a are determined we
can (in principle) evaluate the conguration variables through formulas
(25)(26). it is essential to realize that our transformation of the mo-
menta among themselves must be invertible:
if it were not, the trans-
formation would not be canonical and the new form given to the wave
equations would not be equivalent with the kg system.
formula (25) can be written in closed form provided we are able to carry
out this inversion. we are thus faced with the problem of mapping the
new momenta back onto the old ones, which amounts to solve the system
(38)(39) now for the unknown y2  p, y3  p in terms of y
3  p ,
assuming this time that the latter are given and taking (32) into account.

2  p, y

positive-energy condition
the domain where (38)(39) must be inverted can be limited to the
positive-energy sector. so we require not only that p is timelike and
future oriented, but also that every vector pa is timelike and points
toward the future, which entails p  pa > 0 and pa  pb > 0.
at this stage it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless quantities

thus (18) becomes

(64)

proposition (i) stated above ensures that the transformation from the

14

old momenta to the new ones is safely invertible in an open set of values
given to the couple , . as these quantities are rst integrals for free
particles, their limitation to an interval denes a sector which is invari-
ant by the motion. characterization of this sector in terms of physical
quantities will be discussed in the next section.
remark:
innitely many other domains ensuring a unique solution to (57)(58)
could be exhibited. but we can enlarge the interval for  only at the
price of shrinking the one for .

4.3 physical conditions

in view of eqs. (28), the wave function includes a factor (y
c22)(y
thus limited by the constraints y
given from the outset. on the mass shell, we can replace y
in (49) or in the denitions of , .

12  p 
13  p  c23). the relevant domain for the arguments of  is
1a  p = c2a, where the masses are
1a p by c2a

the particular case where  vanishes is interesting because it arises when
the particles are mutually at rest, provided m2 = m3, which includes
the special case where all masses are equal. moreover  remains small
insofar as 2, 3 and the velocities are not too large.
for simplicity, let us focus on the assumption that 2, 3 are small
enough. in order to keep some contact with nonrelativistic mechanics,
our scheme must encompass the case  = 0; thus the solution which
reduces to x  for vanishing  is excluded. since the transformation of
momenta must be one-to-one, we are also obliged to discard the solutions
which reduce to the xed point for vanishing .
finally we have no other choice than the solution given by x = s(, ).

let us now discuss in more details how we can manage, by simple
physical requirements, to keep ,  within admissible values allowing to
apply proposition i.

in order to realize this situation we are led to restrict the squared-mass
dierences by the condition (75). then, condition (70) permits to apply
proposition i.

2 , 1

untill now, we have proposed condition (70) which involves not only the
relative momenta but also p 2. since we consider the positive-energy
sector of free particles, it is clear that

p 2 > x p2

for the sake of a simple kinematic interpretation, we have better to
replace (70) by the stronger condition

|ep2

(76)

which is just a little more restrictive and oers the advantage of involv-
ing only masses and spatial velocities.

is sucient to demand

for inequal masses, similar results could be derived, but the discussion
would become a bit complicated. we summarize:
proposition ii
in sofar as the mass dierences are not too large, we keep the range of

in particular we consider three equal masses, velocities under c/3 ensure
that we can invert our formulas with s(, ) as in proposition i.

all the quantities involved in condition (70) (resp. (76)) are rst inte-
grals for free particles, thus (70) (resp. (76)) denes an invariant sector

4.5 new form of wave equation

as seen in section 4.1, the dierence equations are (28) or equivalently
(29)(30). according to (19) the dynamical equation (sum equation) for
free particles is

(3x m2

ac2  p 2)  = (d + 6p 2) 

(92)

19

of course  must be here considered as a function of y
in view of (56)(60) we can write as well

2p, y

3p, p 2, eya.

 =

x 2 +

3
4

2

(2  3x)2

(93)

where x = s(, ) according to (62)(63). we must remember that , 
are functions of the new momenta through (49).
but equation (28) tells that on the mass shell we can replace y
1a  p
by ac2 (thus y
(29) (30) ). more-
over we impose that the total linear momentum has a sharp value k.
let us make this convention that f is the expression of any f on the
momentum-mass shell, namely

a replaced accordingly, see eqs.

f = subs (y

1a  p = ac2,

p  = k,

f )

(94)

using an obvious notation borrowed from maples syntaxis. it is meant
that y

1a is as in (22) and we set

k2 = m 2c2

(95)

for instance, if we dene

  (y  k/k2)k

 = y
by
we can write ey = by, therefore
d = 6[(by

2)2 + (by

3)2 + by

2  by
3]

moreover (49) yields

m 2c2u = 2c2(by2by3 +

1

2by2
3)

m 2c2v = 3c2(by2by3 +

1

2by2
2) (96)

it is noteworthy that, in the case of two equal masses  is of the order
of 1/c2, whereas for three equal masses both  and  are o(1/c2).
taking into account the mass-shell constraints and the sharp value of
p  we derive the reduced equation

(3x m2

a  m 2)c2  = (d + 6m 2c2 ) 

(97)

notice that, apart from 2, 3 that are xed parameters,  depends only
3 and m 2. the only operators involved in (97) are multipli-
by
on by
2,
cations by the projections of y
a orthogonal to k, they are essentially
three-dimensional. whereas d has a familiar form (just use the rest

20

frame, where bya  byb = ya  yb) it is not the case for . fortunately
it can be checked that, at least for equal masses, the term c2 is in fact
of the order of 1/c2. for this purpose it is convenient to set

m 2c2 =

1

m 2c2 

so we end up with

(3x m2

a  m 2)c2  = d  +

6

m 2c2  

(98)

(99)

for three equal masses,  can be expanded in non-negative powers
of 1/c2 and it turns out that its zeroth-order piece is biquadratic in by
a.
proof. it can be easily read o from (49) that in this case u, v thus
also ,  are of the order of 1/c2. getting back to system (52)(53) one
nds that

 = 2u  v + o(1/c4)
 = 2v  u + o(1/c4)

inserting into (43) yields

 = 3(u2 + v2  uv) + o(1/c4)

(100)

(101)

hence

(0) =

3
4

m 4c4 = (0) + o(1/c2)

2 +by2

[(by2

2)2 +(by2

3) (by2by3)(by2

2)(by2

3)] (102)

thus, when all ma = m, the last term in the r.h.s. of (99) can be
considered as small.

free-particle motion is now described only in terms of by and k.
imposing by (21) that total linear momentum is diagonal permits, through
equation (31), to eliminate y
a  k, where the new relative energies cy
a 
k/k2 are conjugate to the new relative times.
it is of interest to notice that these new relative times are linear
combinations of the old ones with coecients that are analytic func-
tions of the momenta; the reader will check it using (25)(26)(42) and
(49)(36)(37).

after reduction, the three-body kinematics has no more degrees of
freedom than in the non-relativistic problem. but we must keep in mind
that this picture is valid only in sofar as we can revert to all the initial
variables, which (at least for equal masses) is ensured for moderately
relativistic velocities.
the new variables y

5 how to introduce interactions

we can now consider the system (92) (29)(30) as a starting point for
introducing mutual interactions.
to this end, we shall modify the sum equation (92) by a term which
carries interaction, whereas the dierence equations (29)(30) remain
untouched.
doing so we manage that p remains conserved, and keep assuming that
its eigenvalue is a timelike vector k; therefore the factorization of  given
by formula (31) remains valid and eliminates two degrees of freedom.

the interaction potential will be written in closed form in terms of the
reducible coordinates z
b, and all calculations will be carried out
using these variables.
remark: the reducible (momentum) coordinates p
to form the quantities p and y

a are re-arranged as

a, y

a.

adding interaction into (92) produces the dynamical equation

(3x m2

ac2  p 2) = d  + (18v + 6p 2) 

(103)

like in the free case, d is given by (17) and  is given by (93) in terms
of x = s(, ).
the dierence equations remain (29)(30) like previously. of course,
v cannot be chosen arbitrarily but it is not dicult to nd a general
admissible form of v such that the dynamical equation (103) is compat-
ible with (29)(30). compatibility requires that v commutes with the
operators in the left-hand sides of (29)(30). for instance the interaction

2, ez

3 and p 2.

naturally v must be poincare invariant, which is realized by taking a

potential v may depend on ez
function of the various scalar products formed with ez
demanding that  diagonalizes p  with eigenvalue k, with k  k > 0,
we can in (103) replace ey by by.
taking (29)(30) and (98) into account yields the reduced equation

actually solving (104) diers from a non-relativistic problem by the last
term, which involves the momenta but does not depend on the shape of
the interaction (and survives in the free-motion limit). still this term
depends on the total squared mass.
for simplicity, we can consider an interaction such that

18v = 12 u12(ez

2) + 23 u23(ez

3  ez

2) + 31 u31(ez
3)

(105)

where ab are coupling constants and uab arbitrary (but poincare in-
variant) functions. in this model, u12 is independent from q
3, etc, with
cyclic permutation; the formal input of our interaction consists in two-
body potentials.
so (104) can be written

(3x m2

a  m 2)c2 =

d + [12 u12(bz

(107)

describes a three-boson harmonic oscillator.
in order to handle equation (104) it is tempting to neglect its last term.
invoking the limit of a large total momentum (m 2   ), as in [12],
doesnot seem to permit a perturbation treatment. we prefer to consider
developments in powers of 1/c.

5.1 equal masses

assuming for simplicity that ma = m, equation (104) becomes

(9m2  m 2)c2  = d + 18v  +

6

m 2c2  

(108)

it will be considered as an eigenvalue problem for  by setting 6 =
(m 2  9m2)c2. as all masses are equal, thus  = (0) + 0(1/c2). at
rst order in 1/c2 we can replace  by (0) and m 2 by 9m2 in (108).
using the rest frame we obtain

 = [y2

2 + y2

3 + y2  y3  3v ]  

1

9m2c2 (0) 

(109)

neglecting the last term yields the nonrelativistic limit (divide by m
and remember that in our formulas, v has dimension of p 2).
taking into acount the contribution of (0) permits to calculate the
rst relativistic correction.

23

5.2 cluster behaviour

as pointed out by sazdjian [10], in any formulation of the dynamics
which makes explicit reference to total momentum, it is dicult to dis-
cuss cluster separability. but it is reasonable to demand that the reduced
equation be in a sense separable, in order to ensure a factorization of
the internal wave function when there are noninteracting clusters.
with this requirement in mind, we can already observe that the poten-
tial (105) is formally separable in terms of the variables z.
but the interpretation of each uab as a two-body term runs into a com-
plication: there is no evidence that the variable z
a, exactly matches
the cluster of particles {1a}. a similar remark arises concerning the
matching of z
the physical interpretation of the new conguration variables z
a is not
straightforward; they are relative variables since they commute with p ,
but they suer from this complication that the transformation formulas
(25) mix z2 with z3. similarly (beside its dependence on total momen-
tum) each new variable q
a depends not only on qa (with the same label
a) but also on all qbs with b 6= a.
but we can consider (91) on the momentum-mass shell. at least for
three equal masses, the only occurence of the velocity of light is through
the product m c, so we obtain from (91)

2 with cluster {23}.

3  z

bz
2 = bz2 + o(1/|m c|),

bz
3 = bz3 + o(1/|m c|)

(110)

and, of course, bz
variables bz

3bz

2 = bz3bz2 +o(1/|m c|). thus, at leading order, the
a and bza still coincide; so the potentials uab in the reduced

equation (106) can be approximately considered as two-body terms.

6 concluding remarks

as a rst step, we succeeded in constructing three mass-shell constraints
describing the free motion of three scalar particles. in contrast to the
kg system, these new wave equations permit to eliminate two degrees of
freedom and get reduced to a covariant equation with three-dimensional
arguments.
our approach rests on a transformation of the momenta involved in
the original kg system. in contradistinction to sazdjians proposal and
the homographic relations that approximate it (eq (13) of ref. [10], eq
[11]), our transformation from the old momenta to the
(4.15) of ref.

24

new ones is explicitly given by simple quadratic formulas. inversion of
these formulas is a fourth degree algebraic problem which could be (in
principle) discussed and solved in closed form; due to its complexity,
approximate developments are more ecient in practical calculations.
we used a couple of identities that are specic of the three-body case;
thus an extension of the present work to n > 3 is by no means straight-
forward!
in the present state of the art, equivalence of the new equation (97)
with the sum of the original kg equations is ensured at least in a large
sector characterized by positive energies and conditions that involve the
masses of the particles. when the masses are not too dierent one from
another (and in particular for equal masses), these conditions amount
to impose a bound on the velocities; but this bound is still high enough
to allow for the description of a relativistic regime.
the case of very large velocities requires further investigations. we gave
here sucient conditions for an invertible transformation; it remains
possible that a more detailed discussion enlarges the present results.
this analysis of free-body kinematics provides us with a solid ground.

in a second step, we introduced interaction in the sum equation. the
model obtained by this procedure respects poincare invariance. it re-
mains covariantly reducible to a wave equation with three-dimensional
arguments; free motion is recovered in the absence of interaction term.
the interaction term v is formally cluster separable; actually for-
mula (105) is an ansatz which permits to combine two-body interactions
without spoiling the compatibility of the mass-shell constraints. true
separability (in terms of the original individual particle coordinates) is
recovered only in the large-total-mass limit.
the two-body input of our model can be either phenomenological or
motivated by consideration of eld theory.

when the three masses are equal, the velocity of light arises in 
through the product m 2c2, which facilitates the expansion in powers of
1/c2. at the rst order, the reduced equation is similar to a familiar
schroedinger equation supplemented with a perturbation; insofar as the
interaction is not explicitly energy dependent (or if this dependence is
of higher order) one is left with a conventional eigenvalue problem.
this situation provides a basis for eventually undertaking the study of
cases where the mass dierences are not zero but still remain relatively
small.
in the hope of applications to three-quark or three-nucleons systems, we
plan an extension of the formalism to particles with spin. the contact
with more elaborated (but more complicated) theories, such as qed

25

and qcd, will be discussed in a future work.

appendix 1

in non-relativistic classical mechanics, canonical transformations are
symplectic dieomorphisms of phase space.
in general they do mix
the qs and the ps.
but a point transformation (in conguration space) simply transforms
the qs among themselves, say q = f (q). then invariance of the sym-
plectic form [13] fully determines the ps in terms of the qs and the ps.
when conguration space is at, the q and p variables play symmetric
roles in the general formulas of analytic mechanics, so there is no di-
culty in dening as well point transformations in momentum space (but
this possibility is not usually considered in textbooks). in this case, one
transforms the momenta among themselves, and one further determines
the new variables q in terms of qs and ps through the requirement that
the complete transformation law is canonical.
in the position (resp. momentum) representation of quantum mechan-
ics, a quantum analog of point transformations in conguration (resp.
momentum) space can be generated by an invertible transformation of
the arguments of the wave function. this transformation among c-
numbers obviously induces a transformation among the multiplicative
operators they dene.

all the curves z = r(x) are tangent to the x axis at a xed point
x = 2/3. for  > 1 and  small enough, the curve representing
r(x) is four times cut by the straight line z = 2. in the limit when

axis, and the other ones respectively reduce to x + and x .

this analysis shows that, with our restrictions, the 4th dgree equation
r(x) = 2 has two real solution, but only one of them reduces to x +
