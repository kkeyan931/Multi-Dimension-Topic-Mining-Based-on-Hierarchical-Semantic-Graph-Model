abstract

we describe a simple lattice model of higher-curvature quantum gravity in two
dimensions and study the phase structure of the theory as a function of the
curvature coupling. it is shown that the ensemble of at graphs is entropically
unstable to the formation of baby universes. in these simplied models the
growth in graphs exhibits a branched polymer behaviour in the phase directly
before the attening transition.

1. introduction

a longstanding problem of quantum gravity is to determine the eects of the addition
of higher-curvature counterterms to the canonical gravity action. this problem is most
tractable in two-dimensions, mainly because the theory can be regularized and studied
using the discretization approach (see [1] for reviews).
in this case, the simplest term
of this type that one could add is  r(g)2, where r(g) is the scalar curvature of a two-
dimensional metric g and the coupling constant  is inversely proportional to the square
of the worldsheet ultraviolet cuto. the continuum euclidean partition function is given
by the path integral over all worldsheet metrics

z =z dg exp(cid:20)z

d2z qdet g (cid:18) +

1

4g

r(g) +  r(g)2(cid:19)(cid:21)

(1.1)

where  is the cosmological constant and g is the gravitational constant. for   0 the
r2 term in the action is irrelevant and the system lies in the pure gravitational phase, i.e.
that with action consisting of the cosmological and (topological) einstein terms and with
critical string exponent str =  1
2 (for a xed spherical topology). on the other hand,
the limit    suppresses large curvature uctuations of the metric and the statistical
ensemble becomes atter and atter at short distance scales. at  =  only at surfaces
contribute to the partition function.

the problem of whether or not this system undergoes a phase transition between the
at and pure gravitational phases at some nite coupling c has been studied using quan-
tum liouville theory in [2] and investigated numerically in [3]. an exact non-perturbative
solution has been obtained in [4] for spherical topologies using matrix model techniques
and it was shown that str =  1
2 for all nite values of . the model always reduces
at large length scales to a model of pure gravity, i.e. there is no transition to a non-
perturbative phase of at metrics, and only when all surfaces with non-minimal r(g)2
are completely forbidden ( = ) does str change. the key feature of this proof is an
appropriate extended model that interpolates between the xed lattice (or crystalline)
at space model and the pure gravity model [5]. a simplied model which exhibits the
same characteristic features has been studied in [6]. in this paper we shall give a sim-
ple demonstration of the absence of a phase transition from a random to a at phase of
r2 gravity directly in terms of the fractal structure of two-dimensional quantum gravity.
this has the advantage of being technically much simpler than the solution given in [4]
while at the same time exposing some of the physical and geometrical characteristics of
r2 gravity.

in section 2 we shall describe how to incorporate the eects of the r2 action in two-
dimensions, using the fact that the value of str is controlled by the structure of baby
universe formation on the surfaces of the ensemble. this leads to the study of surfaces with
branching outgrowths (which we call bottleneck surfaces) which have a contribution to

1

the r2 term proportional to the neck thickness. in section 3 we prove that the generating
function for the bottleneck surfaces is an analytic function of the curvature coupling
, thereby demonstrating the absence of a phase transition as  is continuously varied.
finally, in section 4 we present a model which captures the essential qualitative features
of the attening transition. there we prove that the ensemble of at graphs is unstable to
the formation of baby universe outgrowths, so that the attening transition can only take
place exactly at  = . these results show explicitly that no matter how at the system
is at short distance scales, it always destabilizes at long wavelengths into the familiar
ensemble of highly fractal baby universes.

2. baby universes and lattice r2 coupling

the dynamically triangulated version of pure two-dimensional quantum gravity is

given by the partition function

bz() =xa

ea z(a) =xa

ea xtta

1

(2.1)

where z(a) is the xed area partition function and ta is the topological class of trian-
gulations of area a (a is proportional to the number of triangles of ta). a given choice
of t  ta corresponds to a particular discretization of the surface. the local intrinsic
curvature of a vertex i  t of coordination number qi is ri = 2(6  qi)/qi, so that the
discretized form of the r2 action is given by

z

d2z qdet g r(g)2  42xit

(qi  6)2

qi

(2.2)

however, there is a much simpler way to incorporate the eects of the r2 term by
simply nding an appropriate extended model which interpolates between pure two-
dimensional quantum gravity and a at phase of worldsheet metrics. the main idea
comes from the fact that the universal constant str, which describes the nature of the
geometry, is related to a surface roughness structure of two-dimensional quantum gravity,
the distribution of minimal bottleneck baby universes on the ensemble of triangulations
[7]. a baby universe of area a0 is a small region of the triangulation joined to the bulk
solely by a minimal neck, i.e. a loop consisting of only three links. intuitively, they can
be pictured as forming bubblings on the surface. for a triangulation of area a   (the
continuum limit), the asymptotic behaviour of the xed area partition function is

z(a)  astr3 e0a

(2.3)

where 0 is the critical cosmological constant (so that the series (2.1) converges for all
 > 0). from this it can be shown [7] that the distribution na(a0) of baby universes is
related to the string susceptibility exponent by

na(a0)  ka3str (a  a0)str2astr2

0

(2.4)

2

where here and in the following k denotes a constant which is independent of the areas
and is of the order of unity. this result shows that, as str increases, the number of
baby universes increases as na(a0)/a  kastr2
. thus str not only measures the fractal
structure of the typical surfaces that contribute to the partition function, but also their
branching ratio into minimal bottleneck baby universes.

now consider the situation where the curvature coupling  is very large and the r r2
topology has a minimum r r2, denoted r2

term is thereby trying to make the surfaces as smooth as possible. a surface of spherical
min, which is independent of its area (basically
corresponding to a dual graph consisting of hexagons and 12 pentagons). if we take two
such surfaces (not necessarily of the same area) and join them as shown in g. 1 by cutting
out a triangle from each one and stitching them together, then we create a surface with
min + , where  is the

one minimum length bottleneck baby universe and r r2 = 2r2
contribution to the r r2 term arising from the bottleneck. we can iterate this procedure

to produce surfaces with n bottlenecks and

z r2 = r2

min + n(cid:16)r2

min + (cid:17)

number of bottlenecks. on the other hand, most of the surfaces of a given area created in

the important point here is that r r2 is not proportional to the area, but only to the
this way are geometrically very dierent from the single surface with minimum r r2. we
length . in this case it is clear that the contribution tor r2 can be at most proportional

can extend this exercise by joining surfaces together with larger, non-minimal necks of

to the length  of the bottleneck.

to get an idea of how the inclusion of the r2 term modies the distribution functions,
it is instructive to consider a simple example. consider the ensemble of closed rooted trees

3

on a xed lattice. the total number of such trees of length  (taken to be the number of
links in the tree) is n (r)() which behaves asymptotically as (see for example [8])

n (r)()  0 e

(2.6)

where 0 is a universal constant which is independent of the particular type of lattice,
while  > 0 is a non-universal constant. for a given tree of length  there are generically
 dierent ways of drawing the tree on the lattice. we introduce an extra fugacity factor

e for each loop, which is the analog of the curvature term r r2. the total number of

closed rooted trees on a xed lattice of area a is then

w(a, ) =x

n (r)() e

(2.7)

for large areas a  , we can replace the sum in (2.7) by an integral over   [0,)
and suppress the trees which grow too large (2  a) by an exponential damping factor
e2/a. thus asymptotically we have

w(a, ) z 

0

d n (r)() e e2/a  ka0+3/2 e()2a/4

(2.8)

we see that the only eect of the fugacity coupling is to renormalize the entropy parameter
as   . the distribution function (2.8) is analytic in  and the inclusion of a fugacity
factor for the loops is irrelevant from this point of view. in particular, we may adjust the
coupling so that  = , in which case w(a, ) has a power law growth with the area. thus
the non-universal tree growth has no eect on the critical behaviour of the corresponding
grand canonical ensemble quantities either. note that for a self-avoiding random walk on
a regular square lattice, we have 0 =  3
2 (see for example [8]), and w(a, ) contains a
purely exponential growth with the area a of the lattice. by tuning to the point  = ,
the distribution in this case is independent of the size of the lattice.

3. analytic structure of the bottleneck graph generating
function

we will now write down an expression for the partition function of bottleneck surfaces
and argue that it is an analytic function of the r2 coupling . we work at xed spherical
topology and consider the generating function for the ensemble of rooted bottleneck graphs
which is given by

b(r)(cid:16), ; z,{m}(cid:17) =xa

(3.2)

0 (a)  z(a) of unmarked spherical graphs as (r)

where b are the bottleneck nodes of b of branching number qb and neck thickness b,
and m are arbitrary weights associated with the nodes. the number (r)
n (a) of rooted
spherical graphs of area a with n bottlenecks (where the area of each triangle is taken
to be unity) can be constructed inductively as follows. for n = 0 this number is related
to the number (u)
0 (a),
since there are a possible triangles to mark in an unmarked graph. to construct a rooted
graph with n + 1 bottlenecks, we cut out a disk of area b and perimeter  from a rooted
graph with n bottlenecks, and a disk of area c with the same boundary length  from a
0-neck unmarked graph (g. 1). gluing the two cut graphs together along the common
perimeter of the deleted disks yields a rooted graph with n + 1 bottlenecks. in doing so,
one must be careful of the degeneracies which occur in this inductive cutting procedure.
consider two spherical (0-neck) graphs which are identical to each other except for their
triangulations inside two disks, of areas b0 and c0 and with identical boundary length ,
on each respective graph. these two inequivalent graphs, when glued onto other lattices
to produce bottleneck graphs, yield the same set of surfaces.

0 (a) = a (u)

we shall rst consider the sub-ensemble of linear chain bottleneck graphs. we intro-
duce the disk amplitude z1(; b) which is dened to be the number of surfaces of area b
and one boundary of length . if we join two surfaces of areas b0 and b  b0 > b0, each
having a single boundary of length , along their common boundaries, then we obtain a
closed surface of area b with a marked loop of length  partitioning it into two parts of
areas b0 and b  b0. since the boundary has  links, there are generically  dierent
ways of joining the two surfaces to obtain distinct nal surfaces (provided that b0 and
b  b0 are large enough). moreover, any surface of area b with a marked loop of length
 partitioning it into two parts of areas b0 and b  b0 can be uniquely constructed in
this way. therefore, for large b and b0, there are

g1(b, b0; )   z1(; b0)z1(; b  b0)

(3.3)

closed surfaces of area b with a marked loop of length  that partitions the surface into
two parts of areas b0 and b  b0. the asymptotic large area behaviour of the disk
amplitude is [9]

z1(; b)  bstr2 e0b str1 e

(3.4)

where  > 0 is as in (2.6). this amplitude therefore increases with  for small , and for
large perimeter loops (2  b), z1(; b) is exponentially damped by worldsheet nite size
cuto factors like e2/b [9].

we shall also use the annulus amplitude z2(1, 2; b) which is the number of surfaces of
area b with two holes of boundary lengths 1 and 2. its large area asymptotic behaviour
is

z2(1, 2; b)  bstr1 e0b (1 + 2)str1 e(1+2)

(3.5)

and for large loops it is suppressed by the worldsheet infrared cuto e(1+2)2/b [9]. then

5

there are

g2(b, b1, b2; 1, 2) = 12 z1(1; b1)z1(2; b2)z2(1, 2; b  b1  b2)

(3.6)

distinct surfaces of area b with two non-intersecting loops of lengths 1 and 2 enclosing
areas b1 and b2, respectively. neglecting the graphs counted by z1(; b) and z2(1, 2; b)
which themselves have bottlenecks, i.e. assuming that (3.4) and (3.5) correctly count the
disk and annulus graphs with no bottlenecks of lengths smaller than  and 1, 2, an n-neck
linear chain can then be constructed by gluing together n  1 annulus graphs in between
two disk graphs. we assume that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the latter
congurations of graphs and those obtained by slicing an n-bottleneck graph along each
of its necks. these assumptions will be sucient to determine the analytic properties of
the full generating function.

we may now write down an expression for the number l(r)

n (a; 1, . . . , n) of rooted
linear graphs of total area a and with n bottlenecks of lengths 1, . . . , n. in the continuum
limit, we can replace sums over areas and bottleneck loop lengths by integrals. the lower
limits of integration for the perimeter integrals are 3 links (the minimal bottleneck size),
while those of the area integrals are 1 triangle. as all area integrations are ultraviolet
nite, there is no danger in continuing their limits down to ai = 0. incorporating the
smooth infrared cutos on the lengths as described above and the loop fugacity factor
e2i for each neck, this yields the combinatorial identity

being uniformly bounded by an analytic function, the generating function cannot have

any singularities as  > 2  0 is varied and it is analytic in the variable 2  0+
  . furthermore, since the critical cosmological constant (3.12) is itself an analytic
function of , there are no singularities as  is varied throughout its range. therefore,
the linear bottleneck generating function is an analytic function of   r+. there are
no phase transitions within the ensemble of linear bottleneck graphs as one continuously
varies the r2 coupling constant.

we now consider the full bottleneck graph ensemble with generating function (3.1).
to study a bottleneck distribution with arbitrary branchings, we shall need to use the
genus 0 n-loop amplitude zn(1, . . . , n; b). we can determine its approximate asymptotic
behaviour as follows. for each additional loop that is drawn on a graph there is an extra
combinatorial area factor giving an overall entropy bnz(b) for locating the centers of
the loops on the closed surface. furthermore, each loop on the surface contributes an
exponential length growth ei, and the smooth infrared cuto on large perimeter loops

is e(pi i)2/b. the crucial point, however, is that the n-loop amplitude depends only on

the sum of the loop lengths [9]. the natural ansatz is then

zn(1, . . . , n; b)  bstr3+n e0b  nxi=1

(3.16)

we note that this ansatz only dictates the large area and loop length dependence of the

it follows that a general bottleneck function can always be bounded from above by a
function which is given by a product of incomplete gamma-functions and other elementary
functions. in the phase  > c, the n-neck distribution functions are analytic in . the

grand canonical distribution function b(r)(, ; z) is therefore expected to be an analytic
function of   r+. note that the recursive denition (3.24) is reminescent of that for
the generating function of a branched polymer ensemble [10].
in the next section we
shall consider a slight simplication of the model dened by (3.24) which is amenable to
explicit analysis and thereby demonstrate that this similarity is not a coincidence.

4. a model for the flattening transition

we shall now present a model for the transition between at and random graphs which
captures the essential qualitative features of the attening transition. we will consider
two simplications of the full bottleneck graph generating function. first, we start with

figure 2: schematic representation of the iterative denition of the bottleneck surface
generating function. the shaded circles represent the loop functions (, a, ; z,{m})
while the lines represent 0-neck surfaces. each attachment is done by gluing the surfaces
together along a common deleted disk.

the ensemble of regular square lattices, which in the schematic representation of g. 2 are
represented by the rooted lines. let z (0)
 (a) be the number of such at graphs of area a
and with a single square loop of side  drawn on them (the 0-bottleneck partition function).
we are interested in the generating function z(a) for the ensemble of bottleneck surfaces
of area a with a single loop of side  drawn on them, which is depicted by the shaded
circles in g. 2.
it is constructed recursively as described at the end of the previous
section. we start with a at base lattice of area a0 and put an outgrowth of bottleneck
graphs with a square loop of side n on it. there are a0 possible ways to do this and the
area of the new graph is a0  n2. however, the eective area remaining to insert a second
outgrowth of bottleneck surfaces of loop perimeter 4n is a0  4n2 because of the excluded
area eect. each such outgrowth is attached to the base graph with a fugacity ew(n),
where w(n) is a function which satises w(1) = 1 and w(n)  0, but which does not grow
as fast as n2.

this procedure can be used to build the full generating function z(a) by summing
over all possible ways of attaching outgrowths to the base graph. dividing by the permu-
tation symmetry factor for a k-branch surface, we have

z(a, ) = z (0)

(4.1)
actually, one must consider square lattices with positive curvature defect insertions to be
able to close them on a spherical topology. this modication would not aect the qualitative
behaviour described in the following. the model could of course be extended to include non-
square lattices and arbitrarily shaped bottlenecks.

we will now analyse the analytic properties of the solution of the innite-term recursion

relation (4.3) as a function of  and . from (4.2) it follows that

(4.7)

bz(,  = ) = bz (0)

so that the suppression of curvature uctuations via an innite r2-coupling leaves only
at (square lattice) graphs. in this at phase, the partition function diverges only at the
critical point (0)
str = 2. for

c = 0 and formally the string susceptibility exponent is (0)

 < , it follows immediately from (4.3) that the partition function bz(, ) determines
a dierent universality class than the at phase. to see this, we suppose that bz(, ) has
the same critical behaviour as bz (0)
 (), i.e. that bz(, ) diverges at some critical point
at some  = c > c, and so from (4.3) and (4.6) the partition function bz(, ) diverges
before its critical point is reached. thus a critical behaviour at any  <  whereby

 = c. if this were the case then the smallest of the n(, ) in (4.5) would become zero

12

the random geometry changes.

bz(, ) itself diverges is inconsistent. it is only at  =  that the universality class of
physically then, the at lattice system at  =  is entropically unstable to the
formation of baby universes that make up the full gravitational ensemble, which gives a
worldsheet geometric picture of why there is no attening phase transition in the two-
dimensional r2 quantum gravity model. in the remainder of this paper we will deduce
what the nature is of the phase when one perturbs the at graph ensemble by baby
universe outgrowths as described above. to get an idea of what the system at  < 
represents, consider the simplication whereby we allow outgrowths of only a single loop
side . this means that we keep only the n =  term in (4.1) and proceeding as in the
general case we would then arrive at

bz(, ) = bz (0)

 ().

(4.8)

this is the standard behaviour of the generating function for a branched polymer ensemble
[11].

indeed, as before, bz(, ) cannot diverge at the critical point c because then
(, ) would reach 0 before bz(, ) reaches . dierentiating both sides of (4.8) with

respect to  using (4.5) yields

(4.9)

since  bz (0)

ishes at some nite value of  where the numerator is regular and non-vanishing. thus
 bz(, )/ diverges at the critical point, and generically we get a branched polymer

ensemble with string susceptibility exponent str = + 1
2 [11]. however, the actual bottle-
neck ensemble contains a complicated mixing of all loop lengths and more care must be
exercised in deducing the critical behaviour.

we begin by deducing some analytic properties of bz(, ) for  <  using the
recursion relation (4.3). note that for xed , bz(, ) is a monotonic decreasing function
of   r+, while for xed  it is a decreasing function of . let us examine the behaviour
of the functions n very close to the critical point  = c. since c = 0 at  = , at very
large  we expect that c is very small so that for n2  1 we nd

(4.15)

so that we can identify min = 1. it follows from these properties of the sequence {n}
that the innite series in (4.3) is absolutely convergent.

we now rewrite (4.3) in the form

1 () +

bz(, ) = bz1(, ) + ch(0)

the right-hand side of (4.16) depends only on the known functions ch(0)
tition functions bzn(, ) for 1  n < . iterating (4.16) thus determines bzn(, ) as a
function only of , , and bz1, for any n > 1. using (4.3) we see that bz1 satises

the numerator of (4.20) is a well behaved function for  > 0 but at some critical point

the denominator will vanish and thereby generate a non-analyticity in bz1. to see this,

we note from (4.19) that

1xn=1(cid:16)a,n  an,n(cid:17) fn

that (4.23) implies

f+1  f =

xn=1(cid:16)a+1,n  a,n(cid:17) fn < 0

(4.24)

provided that fn > 0 n  1. thus {f} is a monotonically decreasing sequence. under
these same assumptions we also have

1xn=1a,n fn =

1xn=1

fn(cid:16)2g(n)  g(n)(cid:17) e3n2(n)w(n) e(n22)n
fn(cid:16)2g(n)  g(n)(cid:17) e3n2(n)w(n).

1xn=1

(4.25)

the last line of (4.25) vanishes in the limit   , so that the rst series in the recursion
relation (4.23) vanishes as   . using this fact and (4.23) it follows that (4.21) can
be written in terms of the single quantity f = lim f as

= 1  f.

(4.26)

f
 bz1

again assuming that the sequence {f} is monotonically decreasing we have that the limit
of the sequence has the lower bound

f > 1 

xn=1an,n

(4.27)

which is positive at large enough . on the other hand, as  decreases the sequence will
go negative and then start to oscillate. it is clear that at small enough  this must happen
because it is straightforward to choose a  for which f2 is already negative. it follows

15

by continuity that the critical point where the sequence {f} monotonically decreases to
f = 0 must exist, and therefore the system is a branched polymer.

to determine the value of str we consider two cases. if w(n) is a strictly increasing
function of n, then by working at very large  we can ensure that the rst term in (4.21)
dominates so that at the critical point

1 (cid:16)g1(1)  g1(1)(cid:17) e

(4.28)

and higher terms are suppressed by factors of e(w(n)w(1)). as long as {f} is a decreasing
sequence, the sum of terms with n  2 in (4.21) converges to something negligible com-
pared to the rst term. now we can make the standard argument that the denominator
of (4.20) will vanish linearly with bz1(, ) which we assume to behave as
bz1(, ) = bz1(cid:16)c(), (cid:17)  b(cid:16)c(), (cid:17)(cid:16)  c()(cid:17)1str

where the function b is regular at the critical point, and therefore str = 1
2 . in the case
that w(n) is constant this argument fails. to show that the model has generic branched
polymer behaviour we would need to show that

(4.29)

1!, 6= 0
2f
 bz 2

when f = 0

(4.30)

but we have not succeeded in nding a proof of this. however, it is straightforward to
solve the recursion equations (4.23) numerically and g. 3 shows the behaviour of f for
e = 104. it is clear that str = 1

2 in this case as well.

we conclude that the system denes a generic branched polymer phase of two dimen-
sional quantum gravity with string susceptibility exponent 1
2 as soon as the coupling  is
tuned away from innity. this model only allows a rather simple subset of all possible
branchings and we expect that the ordinary pure gravity phase (with str =  1
2 ) is recov-
ered by including all of the more complicated branchings in which the path on the base
graph is allowed to be arbitrary. the basic point is that the model above gives a physical
understanding for the absence of a at phase when the curvature coupling constant  is
large.
