abstract

we present component and superspace formulations for the recently-
proposed type iia (or so-called star) supergravity theory, which is time-
like dual to the conventional type iib theory. first, within the component
approach, all terms in the action are xed up to the quartic fermionic ones.
as desired, the kinetic terms for ramond-ramond elds have signs oppo-
site to the conventional case. consistency of these are then insured by the
construction of a superspace description of this theory. as a by-product,
we nd that a single signature parameter s = 1 can interpolate the type
iia and type iia theories in superspace. this superspace result naturally
allows us to present a green-schwarz action, that possesses  -symmetry,
consistent with such backgrounds. we also give general algebraic descrip-
tions of such star theories, so that they can be identied as represen-
tatives of some of the equivalence classes of -invariant green-schwarz
actions.

1. introduction

recently a new class of superstring theories called type iia and type iib theories
(or so-called star theories) has been presented [1]. these are related to the conventional
type iib [2] and type iia [3][4] theories respectively by timelike t-dualities, which are
generalization of the usual t-dualities to the time coordinates or more general spaces with
indenite signatures. the type iia and type iib theories have also been derived from
m-theory by dimensional reductions on timelike circles, instead of the conventional type iib
and type iia theories from the dimensional reductions on spacelike circles.

even though every consideration in string-brane physics indicates that such a star for-
mulation is indeed possible [1] in ten-dimensions (10d) consistently with local supersymme-
try, we still need more explicit construction of corresponding supergravity theory, including
fermionic interactions which become crucial for killing spinor equations upon compactica-
tions. moreover, even though the basic structure of fermionic interaction terms can be easily
conjectured, it is still advantageous to clarify these interaction terms explicitly, excluding
their sign/factor ambiguity.

in this paper, we present an explicit formulation of type iia supergravity theory, namely
we give a lagrangian for an invariant action up to quartic fermionic terms, and supersym-
metry transformation rules. correspondingly, we give an equivalent superspace formulation
which acts as the foundation for a green-schwarz superstring formulation in the presence
of such a supergravity background. this also provides a conrmation for the existence of
the yet-to-be determined quartic fermion terms, and allows the complete determination of
the component theory. we rst used this type of approach many years ago [5], to ascertain
whether the incomplete proposal of the massive type iia theory [6] would admit quartic
fermion terms.

2. component formulation

we start with our result for the component formulation of type iia theory [1]. the
eld content for the type iia theory [1] looks formally the same as that of the type iia
m, , a, b, c, , ), where the potential elds a, b and
theory [3][4], i.e.,
c respectively have the second, third and fourth-rank eld strengths: f, g, h,
while the gravitino  and the dilatino  are both majorana, reecting the non-chiral
feature of the type iia theory.

in this section of component formulation, the antisymmetrization symbol
malized, e.g., pq  (1/2)(pq  pq).

there are some remarks in order: first, the kinetic terms for the ramond-ramond (rr)
bosonic elds have wrong sign, as expected from [1]. second, we found the kinetic terms

4as usual, the latin (or greek) indices in component formulation are for the local (or curved) coordinates.

our signature is (mn) = diag. (+,, ,).

3

for fermionic elds require factors of the 11 -matrix to appear. this is reected by the fact
that our supersymmetry is dictated by the algebra

{q, q} = (pmp)pm ,

(2.4)

where p  (i11)/2 are the usual chiral projection operators for the indices . third, we
found that the patterns of the appearance of the 11 -matrix in various terms in the system is
much like the replacements of m  11m, in addition to (a, c)  (ia,ic) in
[1]. even though there arise some subtle sign ips at many places, we found that what
is happening can be easily understood universally by these replacements. this allows the
identication of a transformation that acts on the gamma matrices together with the rr
sector elds as the origin of the type iia theory relative to the standard type iia theory.
fourth, we found that various signs for other terms, such as that in the chern-simons term,
or those in the exponents proportional to the dilaton  stay the same as in the type iia
case [3][4]. fifth, we found that the exponential dependence on the dilaton  appearing in
the lagrangian is exactly the same as in the type iia theory, despite of the wrong signs for
the kinetic terms for the rr elds. this will result in subtle sign ips for rr eld strength
terms in the dilaton eld equations, that may potentially cause desirable possibilities as
well as obstructions for compactications. relevantly, our lagrangian has the global scale
invariance for the constant dilaton shift:

   + c ,

a  e3c/2a , b  ecb

,

c  ec/2c .

(2.5)

our result does not contradict the common wisdom [7] that the dilaton eld decouples
from the rr elds. this is because all of our rr elds are canonical, making such dilaton
dependence unavoidable.5 sixth, we can also interpret this type iia theory, in terms of n =
1 multiplets. namely the conventional type iia multiplet is composed of two independent
+, , b, ), and the n = 1 matter
n = 1 multiplets of supergravity (sg)
tensor multiplet (tm) (, c, +, a). note that we can have not only the conventional
total action isg + itm, but also an alternative action isg  itm. in particular, 11
in
the kinetic terms of the fermionic elds in (2.1) in the 32-component notation is consistent
with supersymmetric invariance. in terms of superstring language, the bosonic elds in the
multiplet sg correspond to the neveu-schwarz (ns) sector, and those in the tm to the rr
sector for bosonic elds. this is why we can ip the overall sign of the matter lagrangian
itm. it also seems that such freedom of ipping signs only for some the matter lagrangians
is common to all supergravity theories even in lower dimensions.

(2.10)

the wrong signs for the kinetic terms of the rr elds are now reected in the relative
sign between the h 2, f 2 and g2 -terms in (2.10). in the conventional type iia theory
[3][4], this relative sign is positive, and therefore g3 can develop non-trivial background
for spatial directions. in the present case of type iia [1][8], due to the ipped relative sign
for these three terms in (2.10), g3 can develop non-trivial background containing the time
coordinate, in order for a similar cancellation between the three terms to take place, within
our signature convention (+,,   ,). as described in [8], this can be understood such as
the u(1) brations in the timelike direction over the non-compact manifold gcp 2.

formulation is rather straightforward. here we list our constraint set for future reference.

(3.3) has the same factor and sign as the type iia case [10] for its chern-simons term.
as usual in superspace, we can x our constraints, satisfying all the bianchi identities up
to dimension d  1. in principle, there are innitely many equivalent sets of superspace

6some coecients for the type iia superspace constraints in [9] were corrected in [10].

constraints, which are related to each other via super weyl rescalings [11]. however, there is
the simplest set called  -function favored constraint (ffc), rst introduced in order to
simplify the  -function computation in the green-schwarz formulation [12], and used also
in [9] for the type iia theory. even though the usage of the ffc has some drawbacks,
when comparing superspace result with canonical component ones, we adopt this set in
this paper due to its simplicity. we should also mention that ffc constraints correspond
to the use of the so-called string-frame formulation of the component theories even though
the discovery of ffc constraints preceded the latter by some time.

in order to compare the constraints for the type iia with the conventional type iia
theory, we use a convenient signature parameter s = 1, which switches from the former to
the latter. this comparison can be most easily done by studying the bosonic eld equations,
as will be seen later. our set of ffc constraints for type iia or type iia theory is now
summarized as

let us once more emphasize that (3.5) is a consistent superspace description of type
iia as well as type iia theory, by switching the signature of the parameter s = 1. the
consistency of this superspace description implies a component formulation exists complete
with quartic fermion terms its action. such a component theory is related via a set of eld
redenitions to the canonical component theory discussed in section two, and thus insures
that the system also possesses a unique and well dened set of quartic fermion terms for its
complete description.

most of the results in (3.5) are similar to those in [9][10], except for several sign ips
reecting the involvement of 11
in the 32 component spinor notation in the previous
section. in particular, our non-standard supersymmetry algebra for type iia involving the
c, depending on s = 1.
11 as in (2.3), is reected in the sign dierence of t 

the same is also true for g

we now come to the point to see which case out of s = +1 and s = 1 corresponds to
the type iia theory. to see this most eectively, we look into the scalar curvature supereld
equation. to this end, we rst derive the gravitino/dilatino supereld equation, taking the
usual step out of the t -bianchi identity of the (c, ) -type [13][12]. it turns out to that
the gravitino/dilatino supereld equation is independent of the value of s = 1, as

i(btab) + 2a  1

4

(bc)gabc = 0 .

(3.7)

now the scalar curvature supereld equation can be obtained as usual by applying another
spinorial derivative on (3.7), with one  -matrix contracting all the spinorial indices. ignoring
fermionic bilinear terms, it turns out to be7

(3.8)

on the other hand, from our component result, the trace of the gravitational eld equation
(2.6) should result in the same relative signatures for all the f 2, g2 and h 2 -terms for

7the absence of the (cid:0)a(cid:1)2

-term here is natural, because it is similar to the type i supergravity in [12].

the type iia theory.8 in other words, in (3.8), the values of s are

s =( +1 (for type iia theory) ,
1 (for type iia theory) .

(3.9)

considering this point, we nd that the papers [5][9] or [10] with the choice of s = +1 ac-
tually give the type iia theory, instead of the conventional type iia theory.9
it is thus
amusing that just one signature parameter s = 1 can interpolate between the type iia
and type iia ffc in such a compact form.

careful readers may wonder, if the component result (2.2) contradict (3.9), according to
the usual rule of getting component transformation rule from the superspace constraints, as
described in page 323 of ref. [14]. however, this can be easily understood by the ambiguity of
 for the negative chirality components for the gravitino,
assigning either + m
 compared
i.e., the relatively positive or negative sign for the dotted component in m
.10 thus, in terms of superspace language, the ambigu-
with its undotted component m
ity between type iia and type iia theories seem to arise from this signature assignment
ambiguity.

 or  m





an important lesson has emerged from the present result, i.e., when solving superspace
bianchi identities, one must conrm also the eld equations in order to distinguish between
the conventional and star theories. in other words, a consistent solutions to superspace
bianchi identities is not unique.

according to our gravitational eld equation (3.8), the dilaton  seem to couple to the
rr-eld strengths f and h, while not to the g -eld strength. one may wonder if this
contradicts the common wisdom that the dilaton does not couple to the rr-elds. however,
this can be easily understood from the fact that these exponential couplings in eq. (3.8) can
be deleted by an overall exponential factor e+2, e.g., the rst term becomes e2r. in fact,
we expect that the ffc system will have the hilbert action with such a brans-dicke type
dependence on the dilaton.

in this paper we started with the component formulation, and subsequently we gave the
superspace formulation for the ffc. the reason for this is that a superspace formulation, in
particular the ffc, is more dicult than component formulations for getting an invariant

8these relative signs are not supposed to be changed by any super weyl rescalings [11] such as from the

canonical set to the ffc.

9this is not surprising, because in the papers [5][9][10], no eld equations had been derived in order to
conrm the signs of kinetic terms. it is only after we have derived the eld equations that we can see whether
the system corresponds to the type iia or type iia theory.

10note that this is also related to the fact that in 10d, the dotted and undotted spinors are not related

by complex conjugation, unlike the 4d case.

lagrangian, which is crucial for our purpose of conrming subtle sign ips for the rr kinetic
terms. it is the component formulation that can rst guide us to the right lagrangian with
the transformation rules, despite of the usual diculty with handling purely fermionic terms.
on the other hand, we have also seen that the superspace formulation is easier to unify two
theories of type iia and type iia, in terms of just one signature parameter interpolating the
two ffc sets. the similarity between these systems also indicate their close relationship
under some duality like t-duality, as has been suggested in [1].

4. green-schwarz action

based on our superspace formulation, we can look at the corresponding green-schwarz
formulation [7] for the type iia superstring theory. this turns out to be rather straightfor-
ward, because of the parallel structures between the type iia and type iia superspaces.

as we have seen, the type iia system has superspace constraints with sign ips only in
compared with gc. similar ambiguities had been already
limited terms, such as g 

pointed out in 4d context in [15][16], i.e., the  -invariance of the action allows sign ambiguity
in the components gc.11

we start with the action for green-schwarz superstring on the 10d type iia and type

iia backgrounds [17]:

as usual,

the type iia and type iia backgrounds, for the reason to be claried shortly.

the total action (4.1) is invariant under the following  -symmetry:

therefore, (4.1) is  -invariant on the type iia background [17][7] for s = +1, while it is also

c, and ea  (z m )em

11see page 63 in [15], and page 172 in [16].

 -invariant on the type iia background for s = 1. in other words, our green-schwarz
action i in (4.1) has the  -invariance both on type iia and type iia backgrounds, and
in particular, the form of the action itself does not depend on the parameter s.

the fact that the same action (4.1) has consistent  -symmetry both on the type iia
and type iia backgrounds is very suggestive that these two supergravity backgrounds are
just dierent manifestations of a more fundamental theory connected by some duality, like
the combination of t- and r-dualities, as indicated in [1].

5. generalization of star supersymmetry algebras

as some readers may have already noticed, we may generalize our result to lower di-
mensions for extended supergravity theories.12 consider an unconventional n -extended
supergravity algebra in a given space-time dimensions d with the ordinary lorentzian
signature13 is

i, q

{q

j} = h ij

(1)(a) + ij

(2)(5a) i pa ,

(5.1)

where the n  n matrices (1), (2) are diagonal and such that pa can be expressed as
an appropriate contraction of the anti-commutator with some constant matrices. this is
equivalent to a superspace wherein the spinor-spinor-vector torsion tensors reads

t

a = ih ij

(1)(a) + ij

(2)(5a) i .

(5.2)

this clearly covers the standard and star version of 10d type iia supergravity theories.
the existence of the star theories informs us that we can generalize the  -matrices to have
an indenite signature (p, q), where p (or q) is the number of the +s (or s), so that
p + q = n.

if such a superspace supergravity theory is to provide a background for a green-schwarz
action, it is necessary that some axion eld strength occurs. the most general form of this
consistent with the result in (5.2) is

g c = ih ij

(3)(a) + ij

(4)(5a) i .

(5.3)

now we can write a green-schwarz action and ask the question of how many inequivalent
ways there are to determine the various -matrices such that this action admits a -symmetry,
complying with the superspace bianchi identities. the eigenvalues of the four -matrices
dene the equivalence classes of the green-schwarz action. the canonical representatives

12similar idea has been also given in [1].
13it is also easy to extend such model to spaces with arbitrary signatures.

10

of these classes may be dened by re-scaling these eigenvalue so that they all take on only
the values 1 or 0.

the solution to the question above contains the star theories whenever appropriate
eigenvalues of (1) and (2) are negative, as well the unitary theories described in [15] and
[16] and some generalization of these two classes of models. so there are clearly classes of
star models associated with the equivalences classes of -invariant green-schwarz models.
like our result in the last section, only the torsions and axion supertensors determine the
-symmetry of the standard gs action.

(1) = ij, ij

(2) = ij

in lower dimensions, the situation is obviously richer as compare to the 10d theories. in
fact, it has been known for a long time [15] and [16], that in 4d there exist green-schwarz
models with ij
6= ij. these are also members
of the theories dened by (5.2) and (5.3). unlike the star theories in [1], the theories
described by [15] and [16] dene unitary eld theories. some of these unitary theories have
been interpreted as closed gs strings constructed from left-handed open gs strings with
p -supersymmetries and right-handed open gs strings with q -supersymmetries [18].

(4) = 0 but with ij

6. concluding remarks

in this paper, we have presented a systematic formulation for type iia theory, namely
starting with the component invariant action with transformation rules, the corresponding
superspace formulation has been established. we have also developed a compact superspace
constraint notation presenting two sets of ffc for type iia and type iia theories in terms
of just one signature parameter s = 1 interpolating these two distinct systems. based
on such superspace backgrounds, we have also given the green-schwarz superstring action,
that is consistent with such backgrounds. interestingly, we have found that the conventional
green-schwarz action for the type iia background takes exactly the same form as that
for the type iia background, suggesting some fundamental duality interpolating these two
theories, such as the combination of the t- and r-dualities [1].

at rst glance, the presence of kinetic terms for the 10d matter gravitino multiplet
possessing the wrong sign seems a serious drawback of type iia theory, due to the breaking
of unitarity, positive denite energy, and causality, etc. however, we can remind ourselves
that there have been previous interesting discussions of this type. take for example, the
background for the n = 2 superstring [7]. this background describes n = 2 self-dual
[19].
supergravity in the atiyah-ward space-time in 4d with the signature (+, +,,)
thus for such non-conventional superstring/supergravity theories, past experience showed
relations to integrable systems in lower-dimensions, and such self-dual supergravity plays

11

an important role. it is also important to notice that the pure 10d, n = 1 supergravity
subsector of the type iia theory has unitarity, positive denite energy, and causality.

although we have not performed a similar detailed analysis for type iib theory, it is
c. or to be more specic, take eq. (3.1) in [9] but
clear that we can ip some signs in t
c = 0, we now choose the alternative choice,
instead of t
namely, the former to be zero, while the latter two to have opposite sings. even though we
do not give the result here, we can show that the signs for the kinetic terms of the rr elds
in the gravitational equation have the wrong signs.

c non-zero while t

c = t

once we have understood that the maximal supergravity theory in 10d can be decom-
posed into n = 1 submultiplets, where the matter action is assigned with the wrong
sign, we can expect the similar mechanism in any other maximal as well as non-maximal
supergravity theories in any lower dimensions, such as the 4d, n  8 supergravity.

even though our rst presentations of lagrangians and superspace formulations are rather
routine, we still have found something unconventional, like the fact that a single signature
s = 1 can interpolate two systems of type iia and type iia supergrav-
parameter
ity, and moreover, the same green-schwarz action has  -symmetries consistent with such
supergravity backgrounds.

we believe that our explicit result here will initiate further developments in these super-

gravity/superstring/supermembrane or d-brane physics in the near future.
