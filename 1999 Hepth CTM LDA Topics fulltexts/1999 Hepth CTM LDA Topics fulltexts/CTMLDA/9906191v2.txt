abstract

we consider bosonic strings propagating on euclidean ads3, and study in
particular the realization of various worldsheet symmetries. we give a proper
denition for the brown-henneaux asymptotic target space symmetry, when
acting on the string action, and derive the giveon-kutasov-seiberg worldsheet
contour integral representation simply by using noethers theorem. we show
that making identications in the target space is equivalent to the insertion
of an (exponentiated) graviton vertex operator carrying the corresponding
charge. finally, we point out an interesting relation between 3d gravity and
the dynamics of the worldsheet on ads3. both theories are described by an
sl(2,c)/su (2) wzw model, and we prove that the reduction conditions
determined on one hand by worldsheet dieomorphism invariance, and on the
other by the brown-henneaux boundary conditions, are the same.

i. introduction

classical three-dimensional gravity was shown by brown and henneaux [1] to admit an
innite-dimensional conformal symmetry acting on the space of solutions which are asymp-
totic to anti-de sitter space (ads3). an important feature of this symmetry is that the
central extension, with charge

c0 =

3l
2g3

,

(1)

where l is the ads3 scale, and g3 is the three-dimensional newton constant, arises through
the necessity for boundary conditions at innity, and not through normal ordering as conven-
tionally occurs quantum mechanically in two dimensional conformal eld theories (cfts).
the manner in which this symmetry is realized has recently come under scrutiny after it
was pointed out by strominger [2] that a cft at the boundary, forming a unitary represen-
tation of the brown-henneaux symmetry, would have a density of states suciently large to
account for the bekenstein-hawking entropy of three-dimensional btz black holes [3,4]. in
this regard, the essentially classical origin of the central charge has presented an additional
challenge for understanding the corresponding microstates.

more generally, the ads/cft correspondence [5,6] implies in this instance a duality
between string theory on ads3 (times some compact space) and a two dimensional cft.
in a suitable limit, the correspondence reduces to one between supergravity on this space,
and a limit of the cft in which it should realize the brown-henneaux virasoro symmetry,
with its semi-classical central charge. it is then clearly of interest to study string dynamics
on ads3, in the hope of understanding the microscopic origin of (1), and possible quantum
corrections to it and the corresponding black hole entropy.

one is generally hampered in studying aspects of the ads/cft correspondence beyond
the supergravity approximation, as the relevant backgrounds necessarily involve nonzero
ramond-ramond (rr) sector elds, for which the worldsheet description is poorly under-
stood (although see [7] for recent work). however, ads3 is the fortunate exception here in
that there is a well-dened 10-dimensional string background, corresponding to a cong-
uration of fundamental strings and wrapped ns5 branes, for which all the rr elds may
be set to zero and a conventional worldsheet description is possible. indeed, string theory
on ads3 itself has a long history, initiated in [9], as it provides a useful testing ground for
quantum consistency (see e.g. [10]). within the context of the ns1/ns5 system, and the
ads/cft correspondence, the relevant background is ads3  s 3  m 4 (where m 4 is either
t 4 or k3), and worldsheet aspects of this system were studied initially by giveon, kutasov
and seiberg [8], and have since been investigated in [1116]. one outcome of this work
has been the realization, claried in [13,12], that string theory on ads3 has, in particular, a
sector of long strings(see also [17]) in which the worldsheet wraps around the boundary
of the target space and is eectively non-compact. this sector is governed by an eective
liouville system [13], and its s-dual formulation in the d1/d5 system was identied in [13]
with the small instanton singularity in the moduli space of the worldvolume gauge theory.
this latter sector is of particular interest since the worldsheet lives in the asymptotic region
of the target space, and thus should admit brown-henneaux dieomorphisms as a symme-
try. the main purpose of this note is to study the symmetries associated with worldsheet

2

dynamics on ads3 and clarify, in particular, the realization of the brown-henneaux target
space symmetry. following the initial work of [8], this aspect was further elucidated in the
work of de boer et al. [11] who emphasized the distinction between the symmetry of the rst
quantized string hilbert space discussed in [8], and the graviton vertex operators associated
with brown-henneaux dieomorphisms of the target space. in this paper, we shall make the
relation between these two symmetries more explicit in several ways, and emphasize how
the classical origin of (1) in pure gravity is mirrored in string theory.

in particular, we nd that the spacetime virasoro operators of [8] may be obtained
directly via a classical noether construction associated with the asymptotic symmetry of
the worldsheet action under brown-henneaux dieomorphisms. the charges are conserved
asymptotically in the target space and thus this symmetry applies rather naturally to the
long string sector. we also nd that, as in the gravity description, the central extension (1)
is visible within classical poisson brackets.

a related issue concerns strings propagating on backgrounds which dier topologically
from ads3. solutions to classical 3d gravity with negative cosmological constant, or equiv-
alently the low energy equations of motion of the string, are all locally isomorphic to ads3,
and dier only in their global structure. starting from ads3 one may construct these back-
grounds via the process of identifying along discrete symmetries. since the worldsheet action
inherits the symmetries of the target space, one can make use of an analogous procedure to
obtain strings propagating on more general backgrounds. specically, we shall show that
identifying along discrete symmetries of the worldsheet action changes the topology of the
target space, naturally leading to the identication of the vertex operators associated with
btz black holes and conical singularities.

several interesting features emerge from the analysis of these symmetries. in particular,
we nd that the reduction conditions for the 3d einstein-hilbert action associated with
the brown-henneaux boundary conditions, shown in [18] to lead to an asymptotic liouville
dynamics, are actually equivalent to the constraints imposed by dieomorphism invariance
on the string worldsheet. as a consequence, we are able to associate the asymptotic dynamics
of 3d gravity, with a constrained worldsheet action for a bosonic string propagating on
h +

3 = sl(2,c)/su(2).

the plan of the paper is as follows. in section ii we discuss in some detail the symme-
tries of the worldsheet action dened on ads3. in particular, we distinguish between the
ane worldsheet symmetry descending from its denition as a coset wzw model, and the
asymptotic target space symmetry associated with brown-henneaux dieomorphisms. in
the latter case, we dene an asymptotic noether charge in the usual manner, which is shown
to be equivalent to the spacetime generators of [8]. in section iii we show how, on identify-
ing along discrete symmetries, one induces vertex operators which on exponentiation change
the topology of the target space, leading for example to black hole geometries. in sec. iv we
consider the required gauge xing conditions for the worldsheet dynamics, and show that
the resulting dynamics is that of liouville theory, and that in the long string sector the
spacetime generator is directly related to the generator of conformal transformations on the
worldsheet. in section v, we explore the relation between the gauge xed worldsheet dy-
namics and the usual reduction of 3d gravity to liouville theory, via the use of an auxiliary
manifold, whose boundary we identify with the string worldsheet. we conclude in section 5
with some additional remarks on the issue of black hole microstates.

ii. classical dynamics of strings on ads3.

an important property of the brown-henneaux conformal symmetry [1], discussed ear-
lier, is that the central charge is related, not to normal ordering ambiguities, but to boundary
conditions. for this reason it is visible classically. this is also the case in the string theo-
retic description of this symmetry, at least in the so-called long string sector in which the
string wraps around the ads3 boundary. in this section, we study the classical dynamics of
a string propagating on ads3. we shall give in sec. ii b a proper denition of the brown-
henneaux symmetry acting on the string, and derive the contour integral representation for
the generators proposed in [8], as classical noether charges.

a. the action and worldsheet symmetries

the worldsheet theory for bosonic strings propagating on the coset manifold h +

3 =

sl(2,c)/su(2) (or euclidean ads3) is described by an sl(2,c) wzw action,

iw [h] = 

k

2 z

tr(h1h)(h1h) +

ik

12 z

d1tr(h1dh)3,

(2)

where k is the wzw level, which throughout we shall take to be large, and the group element
h is restricted to lie in the above coset, the space of 2  2 hermitian complex matrices with
unit determinant. this model has two ane sl(2,c) symmetries, which are identied under
complex conjugation. the generators for these symmetries are the currents, j = h1h and
its conjugate j.

if we parametrise the coset with coordinates (, , ),

h =   e + e e

e ! ,

e

then the action for the string worldsheet takes the following form

iw [, , ] =

k

2i zw

(  + e2 )d2z.

(3)

(4)

for later convenience, the volume element is taken to be d2z = dzdz, and the factor i in the
coecient then ensures that the action is real. recently, (4) has been the object of intense
study due to its important relation with the ads/cft correspondence [8,1116]. our aim
here is to describe some aspects of this action which may help to understand its spacetime
conformal properties.

the ane currents above can be decomposed into an sl(2,c) basis as j = j ata =

kh1h/2, which in the parametrization (3), and with a convenient rescaling   /2k,
  /k and   /k, take the form,

j  = 
j 3 =  +


2



j + =  2 +   + k,

4

(5)

where we have introduced  = e2/ and  = 2k. one recognizes these currents as

those arising from the free eld representation of the ane current algebra [19], in which 
is treated dynamically. the corresponding action takes the form,

i[, , , , ] =

1

2i z (cid:18)1

2

        e2/ (cid:19) d2z.

(6)

varying this action with respect to  and  one obtains (4) in terms of the rescaled elds.
note that since we take k large, we work classically and ignore quantum corrections  
q2(k  2) aecting the screening charge, and an induced linear dilaton coupling. for a

discussion of related quantum eects see refs. [9,10,8,12].

in the large  sector the last term in (6) is a perturbation and one can use the free ope

representation,

(z)(z)   log(z  z),

(z)(z) 

1

z  z .

(7)

note that the rescaling of  is such that its kinetic term appears divided by two in (6).
this factor is necessary in order to obtain the ope (7) which then leads to the sl(2, c)
algebra at level k for the ane currents dened above. these currents are holomorphically
conserved, j a = 0, as may be checked by using the equations of motion following from (6).
as a consequence of its ane symmetry, the action (4) has a worldsheet conformal
symmetry, corresponding to mappings z  f (z), with central charge c = 3k/(k  2)  3.
the stress tensor which generates the corresponding virasoro algebra takes the sugawara
form, tw = (j +j   (j 3)2)/k, and is (classically)
1
2

tw =  

()2.

(8)

quantum mechanically, normal ordering generates an improvement term for  which is
subleading in k and generates the central charge c  3.
respect to the elds, plus the equation,

the dynamics of the string worldsheet is given by the equations of motion, varying with

tw = 0,

(9)

and its conjugate tw = 0, which are required in order to ensure worldsheet dieomorphism
invariance. since we focus on classical aspects of the dynamics we have, in writing this
constraint, ignored the presence of a product manifold (m) in the string background (ads3
m), and also additional matter elds. while these will be required quantum mechanically
to ensure vanishing of the total central charge, they will not aect our discussion, and we
shall now focus on the ads3 sector.

as we have stressed above, most of the aspects of the brown-henneaux symmetry are
visible classically, and thus we could also work at the level of poisson brackets. a useful
representation for the symplectic structure, motivated by the above opes, follows by using
a (holomorphic) lightcone decomposition. we shall treat z as the time coordinate. in
this situation, the elds  and  become lagrange multipliers because they enter in the
action (6) without time derivatives. on the other hand, the elds  and  are canonically
conjugate and we derive the equal-time poisson bracket,

5

[(z), (z)] = (z, z).

(10)

we dene the dirac delta function as h (dz/2i)f (z)(z, z) = f (z).
the eld  also appears in the action with a linear time derivative. in order to extract
the poisson bracket of  with itself we need to assume that the operator  is invertible. the
invertibility of  is achieved by xing the value of  at innity (z  )  . an explicit
inverse for this operator can be written as 1f (z) = h (dz/2i)f (z)(z, z) where (z, z) is
the step function satisfying (z, z) = (z, z). the equal time poisson bracket for (z) is
then,

[(z), (z)] = (z, z).

(11)

the similarity between the opes (7) and the poisson brackets (10) and (11) should be
evident.

the hamiltonian density for this system can be read o directly from (6). integrating

over a spatial slice yields,

h = i dz

2i

e2/ .

(12)

(the term  has zero poisson bracket with all elds so we omit it.) it is a straightforward
exercise to nd the hamilton equations,

 = [(z), h] = 0
 = [(z), h] = e2/ 
 i dz
 = [(z), h] =
2i

2

(e2/ )(z)(z, z).

(13)
(14)

(15)

the rst two relations are of course the equations of motion which follow from varying (6)
with respect to  and . the third equation can be put in a more familiar form by applying
the (invertible) operator  to both sides (using (z, z) = (z, z)) obtaining,

  =

2


e2/ ,

(16)

which is the correct equation of motion for . the hamiltonian (12) plus the canonical
relations (10) and (11) represent a (holomorphic) canonical version of the action (6).

the conservation of the currents, j a = 0, may also be expressed in hamiltonian form

as,

[j a(z), h] = 0,

(17)

which can be proved directly from the above formulae for j a(z), h, and the poisson brackets.
in the same way, one may check that the currents j a satisfy the sl(2, c) algebra at level
k, and that the worldsheet stress-tensor tw dened in (8) satises the expected classical
algebra,

[tw (z), tw (z)] = (tw (z) + tw (z))(z, z),

(18)

6

generating holomorphic worldsheet conformal transformations1. quantum mechanically,
(18) develops a central charge c  3, as mentioned above.
thus far we have focussed on the conventional worldsheet symmetry of the action (4).
however, since (4) describes a string propagating on ads3, one also expects a realization of
the brown-henneaux [1] spacetime conformal symmetry, corresponding to mappings  
f (), with a classical central charge c  6k. we shall now analyze this symmetry in detail.

b. the brown-henneaux spacetime conformal symmetry

in conformal gauge, the action for a string propagating on a curved background with

metric g and antisymmetric tensor eld b takes the usual sigma model form,

i[x] =

k

4i zw

d2z(cid:16)g(x)abx 

a

x 

b + ib(x)abx 
a

x 
b(cid:17) .

(19)

the spacetime symmetries of this action are given by the killing vectors of the spacetime
2. in the simplest case, the target metric is at,
metric g and antisymmetric tensor b
g = , and the action is poincare invariant.

if we now denote x  = (, , ), and revert momentarily to the geometric eld normal-

ization of (4), the metric g and eld b associated with the action (4) are

ds2 = d2 + e2dd,
b = e2d d.

(20)
(21)

the metric (20) is a maximally symmetric line element having 6 killing vectors. these
isometries lead to the six dimensional ane symmetry of the worldsheet action generated
by the currents (5) and their conjugates.

as pointed out long ago by brown and henneaux [1], the line element (20) has another

interesting asymptotic (  ) symmetry given by the transformations,

bh = ()
bh =

e2()

1
2
1
2

bh =

()

(22)

where () is an arbitrary function of , and  denotes the derivative with respect to .
acting with these transformations on (20) and (21) one generates a new background,

ds2

new = d2 + e2dd +

1
2

d 2

bnew = e2d d + dd.

(23)

(24)

1note that this algebra is equivalent to the ope, tw (z)tw (z)  2t (z)/(zz)2+t (z)/(zz).
2a killing vector of b(x) is a transformation of the elds x such that b transforms as b  b+d
where  is a 1-form.

7

the correction for b is clearly a gauge transformation because  depends only on 
(dbnew = db). on the other hand, the correction for the metric is subleading in . this
is why the brown-henneaux transformations only leave the anti-de sitter metric invariant
asymptotically.

before applying this symmetry to the worldsheet action we pause to mention an impor-
tant aspect of the brown-henneaux transformations (22). two metrics which dier by a
transformation of the form (22) are physically distinguishable because the canonical gener-
ator implementing the transformation is a non-zero quantity, the virasoro charge [1]. since
in three dimensions there are no gravitational waves, it follows that all solutions to the
equations of motion can be generated from anti-de sitter space via a nite brown-henneaux
transformation. one can then write the general solution to the equations of motion with
anti-de sitter boundary conditions in the form,

ds2 = d2 + e2dd 

6t ()

c

d 2

(25)

where t () is an arbitrary function of . (one can also include an arbitrary function of ,
but for simplicity in this paper we will restrict all discussions to the holomorphic sector.)
the anti-de sitter metric corresponds to the vacuum state with t = 0 which is sl(2, c)
invariant. acting with the innitesimal brown-henneaux transformations one generates a
non-zero tnew = (c/12), as in (23). the line element (25) will appear repeatedly in our
analysis. see [2,20,21] for recent discussions.
we now return to the worldsheet action, and consider how the transformations (22),
which generate asymptotic symmetries of the background elds (20) and (21), are manifested
as symmetries of the action. for this to be the case, it is necessary to consider strings whose
worldsheet is embedded in the region near the boundary of ads3, i.e.   . the action
(4) is then invariant under the transformations (22) up to boundary terms.
in order to make contact with the currents (5) and the operator found in [8], we shall
work with the action (6) instead of (4). the brown-henneaux transformations (22) are
easily translated to the holomorphic sector {, , }. the leading terms are,

bh = ,
bh =  +

bh =


2

.


2

,

(26)

we also note that, under holomorphic transformations, bh = 0. an important property
of these dieomorphisms is that they leave invariant the worldsheet stress-tensor,

bhtw = 0,

(27)

where tw is dened in (8). since tw is constrained by dieomorphism invariance to be
zero, this equation reects an important consistency condition. if the product manifold m
is added and tw = 0 is replaced by tw + tm = 0, this equation means that the brown-
henneaux dieomorphisms do not mix tw and tm .

we shall now prove that the action (6) is invariant, up to boundary terms, under (26).
for illustration it will be convenient to take a canonical perspective and view the worldsheet

8

as interpolating between specied initial and nal closed string congurations. at tree
level, a worldsheet without any additional sources then has a cylindrical topology, and may
be mapped to an annulus within the usual prescription for radial quantization.
in this
formulation, one nds that total derivative terms arising from variations of the worldsheet
action reduce to contour integrals at the initial and nal boundaries. thus the variation of
the action (6) under a brown-henneaux dieomorphism (26) is,

bhi = 



4 xj  icj

dz
2i

  +icj

dz
2i

!

(28)

in which the contours cj surround the worldsheet boundaries, and we have discarded a
subleading term in .

(in the derivation of (28) we have used r d2z f = h dzf and

r d2zf = h dzf .)

via the stateoperator map we can always replace the boundary congurations with
operator insertions leading to the conventional spherical topology with insertions at the
boundary points. however, we shall nd that the original canonical picture is more helpful in
the next subsection where we shall consider the noether charge for this asymptotic symmetry.
before turning to this discussion we point out that the above analysis naturally encom-
passes the short and long string sectors of the theory. in the long string sector, where the
worldsheet wraps the entire boundary at conformal innity (  ) in ads3, the annu-
lus description for the worldsheet extends to the full complex plane, and contour integrals
surround innity. in the short string sector the worldsheet does not wrap the boundary,
and may for example be associated with a correlator of a set of vertex operators inserted at
points {zi} on the worldsheet. as shown in [11], the worldsheet then develops thin tubes out
to conformal innity,   , at each insertion point. it is clear that in this case, there are
additional boundaries for the worldsheet associated with regularization near each insertion
point. each insertion point will then lead to an additional contour integral in (28).

c. the noether charge

since the variation of (6) under brown-henneaux transformations (26) reduces to a
boundary term, there is a noether charge associated with this symmetry. as usual, the
charge is the canonical generator of (26). in this section we shall explicitly compute this
charge, which we nd to be equal to the giveon-kutasov-seiberg operator [8].

consider a single closed string in an initial state 1, with coordinates {1(z), 1(z), 1(z)},
and a nal state 2 with coordinates {2(z), 2(z), 2(z)}. (our arguments will generalize
trivially to a more general solution.) we assume that both 1 and 2 are large. the
worldsheet connects the initial and nal congurations generating a cylinder (or some other
higher genus surface) parametrised by the time coordinate z (see fig. 1). as mentioned
earlier, a key assumption we shall need to make is that the initial and nal conditions are
such that the full classical worldsheet is contained in the large  region. this assumption
will not be fullled in general but it is valid, for example, in the long string sector [12,13].
due to the brown-henneaux symmetry of the large  sector, there is a conserved charge
associated with the above diagram. a quick derivation of the noether charge follows by
comparing (28) with the on-shell variation of the action.

where (eom) represents the equations of motion. as before, the contour integrals are dened
at the worldsheet boundaries. in the situation shown in fig. 1, the boundaries correspond
to the initial and nal congurations and j = 1, 2. the string is closed and for simplicity
we assume that there are no additional insertions, although as mentioned earlier the initial
and nal congurations could be replaced via the state-operator map with two insertions.
we now substitute in this expression the variations (26), set the term (eom) to zero, and

compare the result with (28). we nd that the contour integrals h dz cancel out. the

noether identity contains only holomorphic contours and reads,

this relation expresses the on-shell conservation of the charge t i
with only two boundaries at the states 1 and 2, the above equation reads t 1
the orientation into account) which explicitly states the conservation of t.

. in the simplest situation
 (taking

 = t 2

the conservation equation can also be derived by the usual trick of letting  be a function
of z, that is,  = (, z) 3. varing the action with this coordinate-dependent parameter, one
nds t = 0 with t = (/2) + .

as is to be expected, the charge t generates the brown-henneaux transformations (26)
via the poisson brackets (10) and (11). indeed, using (10) and (11) it is straightforward to
check that bh(z) = [(z), t], bh(z) = [(z), t] and bh(z) = [(z), t]. the charge t
is also a worldsheet conformal invariant,

[tw , t] = 0.

(31)

3introducing a dependence on z does not work because the action (6) is actually invariant under
zdependent brown-henneaux dieomorphisms. however, these transformations do not dene a
symmetry of the string theory because the worldsheet stress tensor tw is not invariant.

10

this relation is just the canonical version of (27).

the charges t dened in (30) are innite in number because () is an arbitrary function
of . one would like to factor out the parameter  and extract the charge as a function of
the dynamical variables. however, one notes that the parameter of the transformation ()
is itself a function of a dynamical variable. let4

(in the last equality, we have used the formulae for the currents (5).) we recognize the

generator of the mode n.

we stress that this charge arises in both the quantum and classical calculations.
worldsheet ((z, z), (z, z)) does not wrap around the ads3 boundary, as in the short string
sector, then p = 0 and thus the central charge is zero, as was also pointed out in [11].
or rather it was argued to arise in this sector from disconnected worldsheets, therefore
requiring a second quantized description.
in this sense, for a single compact worldsheet
in the short string sector, the generators (34) do not correspond directly to the brown-
henneaux operators acting on the supergravity action. we shall make some additional
comments on the second quantized description in section v.

the operators ln rst appeared in [8], and were later discussed in [11], where a derivation
of (34) similar to ours was presented, and also in [12], although the full interpretation in

4a more systematic approach has been introduced by teschner [22] in which one organizes repre-
sentations via a new complex coordinate (x, x). this approach has been used in [11,12] and is ap-
propriate for considering generic vertex operators as functions on ads3. in this case ()  (x)
and one can expand vertex operators as a powers series in (x, x) in order to extract the modes. for
our purposes this is unnecessary, although we point out that all of our results could equivalently
be reformulated in this language.

terms of conserved charges for the asymptotic target space symmetry was not given. within
our construction, since these generators appear as classical noether charges, it is clear that
they can only be used at large , where they generate a symmetry of the action. note that
this is a general statement, and not associated with the restricted validity of the free-eld
representation for large .

iii. graviton vertex operators and spacetime topology

anti-de sitter space is the maximally symmetric solution to the string low energy equa-
tions in three dimensions. there exists, however, a continuum of solutions corresponding
to changes in the topology as well as propagation of brown-henneaux gravitons at the
boundary. these solutions are well-known from the gravitational point of view, and one
may consider a string propagating on these backgrounds [23,24].

in this section we would like to point out that in complete analogy with the gravitational
case, there exists a nite brown-henneaux transformation mapping a string propagating on
a black hole to a string propagating on ads3 with an inserted vertex operator. this led to
a natural identication for the black hole vertex operator.

consider the free string action (4), and let k be a killing vector of the target ads3 metric.
we will identify points along a discrete subgroup generated by k. from the point of view of
the target metric, this is just the construction of conical singularities [25] or black holes [4]
starting from the anti-de sitter metric (see [26,27] for generalizations to other dimensions).
the resulting action will be that of a string propagating on a conical singularity, or black
hole, depending on the chosen killing vector k. in the black hole case, it is useful to write
the metric in coordinates such that k = , the identication then takes the natural form
   + 2, and the metric correspondingly acquires the schwarzschild form.
we shall now study the consequences of this construction in string theory, explicitly
working out the simplest case, corresponding to the generation of an extreme black hole
background. in this section, we consider again the geometrical action (4). consider the
symmetry of (4) under holomorphic dilatations

  ,

e2  e2/

(36)

for a given complex parameter . (note that  can depend on z, although we consider here
the simplest situation in which  is constant.) we identify points which dier by the action
of the symmetry,

the parameter  is complex and we assume that there exists a number p such that

  ,

  c.

p = 1.

(37)

(38)

if p is real, this means that  is a root of unity, but we shall not restrict ourselves to this
case. indeed, for real values of p the target metric corresponds to a conical singularity, while
for purely imaginary values the identied spacetime has the topology of a solid torus and
corresponds to a black hole.

12

instead of working with the original elds constrained by the above identications (as

one would do in the orbifold procedure), we make the eld redenitions,

 = p,

e2

=

e2
pp ,
 =  +

(39)

,

1  p
2e2

where p is dened in (38). the key property of the new elds is that the required identi-
cations are now handled automatically because the combinations p and e2 are invariant
under (36). the action for the new elds takes the form (we have erased the primes),

ip[, , ] = i[, , ] z d2z t () 

where i[, , ] is the free action (4) and t is given by

t () = k

1  p2
2 2

,

(40)

(41)

which as one might expect is proportional to the schwarzian derivative {p, } associated
with the map (39). note that there is also a gauge transformation of the beld, b =
k(p  1)/dd, which we shall, however, ignore as it corresponds to a total derivative.
the action (40), resulting from the exponentiation of the induced vertex operator v =
t  , corresponds to a string propagating on the three-dimensional extremal black hole.
indeed, the interaction term in (40) corresponds to adding a piece t ()d 2 to the target space
metric, as discussed earlier in eq. (25). this is not surprising, as the eld redenitions (39)
are a particular case of a nite brown-henneaux transformation (22). if we take p = 1 + ,
with  << 1, the transformation (39) can be put in the form (22) with () =  ln .
note that in this construction only l0 is dierent from zero. had we taken  as a function
of z, which is also a symmetry of the action, we would obtain an action with other virasoro
charges dierent from zero.

one can also introduce the anti-holomorphic transformation    and the solution
will no longer be extremal. if p, p are real, the identications induce conical singularities in
the target space. if p, p are purely imaginary, the target metric is a three-dimensional black
hole of mass m  (p2 + p2).

iv. gauge fixing and liouville dynamics

in section ii, we spent some time considering what happens within the worldsheet theory
when one acts on the target space with a brown-henneaux dieomorphism.
it is now
apparent that there are two symmetries acting on the worldsheet action: the rst is the
ane symmetry generated by the sl(2,c) currents j  j ; while the second is the conformal
symmetry associated with brown-henneaux dieomorphisms which applies asymptotically
in the target space.

13

one can ask whether these symmetries are related, and indeed this is generally true in
string worldsheet constructions, in which one obtains spacetime generators by integrating the
corresponding worldsheet generators against a suitable vertex operator to ensure the correct
conformal dimensions. within our construction, we have developed the two symmetries
separately, and we would now like to see whether they are related in this manner. we shall
nd that this is indeed the case, once we have imposed the appropriate constraints, and that
the resulting dynamics is that of liouville theory.

a. worldsheet virasoro algebra

we begin rst with the worldsheet ane algebra generated by the currents (5). the

additional constraints that must be imposed are,
ktw = j +j   (j 3)2 = 0,

j  = k,

(42)

where j a are the currents (5). the rst equation expresses dieomorphism invariance, i.e.,
the worldsheet stress-tensor is equal to zero (we ignore here any product manifold m). the
second equation is a gauge xing condition for the residual conformal symmetry.

it is interesting to invert the roles of j  = k and tw = 0. since j  commutes with
itself, the equation j  = k can be regarded as a rst class constraint with tw = 0 as the
gauge xing condition. it is well-known that the dynamics of the sl(2,c)/su(2) wzw
model reduced by j  = k, and its conjugate, yields liouville theory [28,29]. however, one
normally supplements j  = k with a dierent gauge xing condition, namely j 3 = 0. we
shall now prove that imposing tw = 0 leaving j 3 arbitrary also leads to liouville theory,
and that the current algebra reduces to a virasoro algebra with central charge c = 6k.

first, as discussed in [28,29], it is straightforward to see that the equations of motion
following from (6), supplemented by the constraint j  = k and its conjugate, lead directly
to liouville theory. indeed, the eld  decouples from  and  and satises the liouville
equation,

  = ke2/.

(43)

the role of the gauge xing constraint is to determine  in terms of . in our case, we
have imposed tw = 0 which yields

 =

1
2k

()2.

(44)

(we have already replaced j  = k in this relation.)

the next step, and perhaps the most important, is to show that under the reduction
conditions (42), the currents (5) lead to a virasoro algebra with c = 6k. in the usual case
discussed in the literature, two of the currents, j  = k and j 3 = 0, are restricted, while
the remaining current j + satises the virasoro with the correct central charge. in our case,
the situation is a bit more complicated because the constraint tw = 0 does not single out a
preferred current to play the role of virasoro operator.

the appropriate operator can be found by rst twisting the worldsheet stress tensor
tw in such a way that it commutes with the constraint j  = k. as discussed in [13] this
operator is given by,

14

imposing the constaints (42), we nd

q(z) := tw  j 3.

q(z) = j 3 = 

()2 s k

2

1
2

2

(45)

(46)

which we recognize as a stress tensor for the liouville eld , and the coecient of the
improvement term implies that j 3 generates the virasoro algebra with c = 6k 5. we
shall see in sec. v a surprising geometrical justication for the appearence of j 3.
proceeding a little more carefully, there is actually a technical step in this reduction
which should be checked, namely, that the poisson bracket of (z) with itself is still given
by (11), after the gauge is xed. this turns out to be the case because, after inserting
the constraints (42) into the action, the kinetic term for  does not change. in the dirac
approach, one constructs the dirac bracket associated with the second class constraints (42).
using [(z), j (z)] = 0 one nds [(z), (z)] = [(z), (z)] = (z, z) as desired (see the
next subsection for more details on the dirac bracket).
it is instructive to consider this reduction at the level of the action. there is a subtlety
here in that the the constraints (42) imply restrictions on derivatives of the elds, and care
should be taken to include the appropriate boundary terms to ensure dierentiability of the
action. however, since this has been discussed in [18], we shall skip the details and write
down the gauge xed form of the action (6),

i[]gf =

1

2i z d2z(cid:18)1

2

  k2e2/(cid:19) ,

(47)

which we recognize as the liouville action in conformal gauge, leading directly to the equa-
tion of motion (43). the elds (, ) are determined through the constraint tw = 0 as in
(44). furthermore, if one couples this system to the background worldsheet metric, neces-
sarily with charge  for conformal invariance, one deduces that the stress tensor is given by
(46) as expected.

thus, after imposing the required gauge constraints, one nds that the ane worldsheet
symmetry is reduced to a local conformal symmetry with central charge c = 6k. the
dynamics reduces to that of liouville theory; in particular we have seen that the stress
tensor has the liouville form. this discussion ts quite naturally with the long string
discussion in [13], and we note that the reduction is similar to the conventional reduction
to liouville dynamics of 3d gravity. in fact, these two procedures are indeed closely related
and we shall make this connection more precise in section iv. however, we shall now turn
to the connection between this virasoro algebra associated with the gauge xed worldsheet
dynamics, and the brown-henneaux asymptotic target space symmetry.

5one may wonder what j + generates after the constaints (42) are imposed. j + is nonzero and, as
should be expected for consistency, generates the same symmetry as j 3, although in a somewhat

convoluted manner. from (42), or directly from (5), we obtain kj + = q(z) where q is given

in (46).

15

b. worldsheet vs spacetime conformal transformations

the propagation of strings on ads3 gives rise to two conformal algebras associated with
worldsheet transformations z  f (z), and spacetime transformations   f () for large
. to summarize the worldsheet discussion of the last subsection, one nds that after the
residual conformal freedom is xed, and the worldsheet stress tensor is set equal to zero, a
remnant conformal symmetry survives which may be thought of as a spectrum generating
algebra. indeed, the three-dimensional current algebra j a is subject to two conditions (see
eq. (42)). the remaining current, which is conveniently chosen to be q = j 3, was shown
to satisfy the virasoro algebra with c = 6k. thus, even after the gauge is xed we are still
left with two virasoro operators, the brown-henneaux generator t dened in (30) (or ln
dened in (34)), and the worldsheet generator q.

the operators ln and q are not in principle related, although they are both constructed
in terms of the currents (5). in order to compare ln and q we need to express ln in terms of
the gauge xed variables. recall, however, that the charges ln commute with the worldsheet
stress tensor and in that sense they are dieomorphism invariant. this means, in particular,
that the algebra of ln does not change after the gauge is xed.

the gauge-xed version of ln is obtained by inserting the conditions (42) into the formula

(34) for ln. this yields,

ln[] = i dz

2i (cid:18)

2

(n + 1)n + kn+1(cid:19) .

(48)

we stress here that (z) should be understood as a functional of  determined by (44). the
only dynamical variable is  whose poisson (or dirac) bracket is given by (11). therefore the
gauge-xed ln[] is a non-local functional (note that tw = 0 is a dierential equation for
()) and generates a complicated transformation for . this should not be a surprise since
it is well-known that working with gauge xed variables often yields non-local expressions.
our task now is to prove that the gauge-xed ln[] still satises the virasoro algebra
with central charge 6kp in the poisson bracket (11). below we shall give a rigorous proof of
this fact. there is, however, an alternative way in which to derive this result which has a
nice geometrical interpretation.

after some direct manipulations using the constraints tw = 0 and  = k, the functional

ln[] can be written conveniently as,

ln[] = i dz

2i

n+1


q(z)

(49)

where q is the worldsheet generator given in (46). this formula seems to imply that ln[]
is related to q simply by the transformation z  (z). however, this interpretation is not
complete because, on one hand, (z) is not a function of z but rather a functional of (z),
and on the other, the schwarzian derivative for the map (z) is not present in (49). even
though q is a virasoro density with central charge 6k, the combination (49) fails to satisfy
the virasoro algebra if the dependence on , through (), is not taken into account.

nonetheless, in spite of these subtleties, eq. (49) is an identity and we can use it to

relate ln with the modes of q. let

16

q(z) = x

qn
zn+2

(50)

be a local expansion for q(z). the modes qn satisfy the virasoro algebra with c = 6k. now
consider the sector with p long strings, given by (z) = zp + (z). the function (z) is a
small perturbation of the solution  = zp. replacing the mode decomposition (50) in (49)
and keeping only the leading term (independent of (z)) we obtain,

ln = xm

1
p

qmi dz

2i

1

z1+mpn =

1
p

qpn

(51)

since qn is a virasoro operator with central charge 6k, this formula implies that ln has
central charge c = 6kp, in full agreement with the results of [8]. the formula (51) has
appeared previously in the context of cyclic orbifolds in [30,31]. in [32,33] it played a key
role in providing a proposal for a statistical mechanical origin for the three-dimensional black
hole entropy. we shall come back to this issue in the conclusions.

one point to note is that the transformation (51) maps q0, q1 into l0, lp. this
implies that the zero mode of l0 has to be shifted in order to have l0, l1 as generators
of the sl(2,) subalgebra. this zero mode shift is equal to the schwarzian derivative of
the map  = zp. the absence of this shift in the formula (49) indicates that the analysis
above is not complete. in particular, we have only obtained the anticipated algebra with
central charge c = 6kp for slowly varying perturbations of the solution  = zp. below we
shall present a more rigorous discussion and prove that quite generally ln[] indeed satises
the virasoro algebra with the correct central charge and zero mode. in fact, the gauge xed
operator ln[] satises the same algebra as the original gks operator ln.

this result result follows as a simple consequence of the invariance of ln under the action
of tw expressed in the relation [ln, tw ] = 0. the necessary tool is the dirac bracket which
has the property that its value does not depend on whether the second class constraints are
imposed or not. the dirac bracket associated to the second class constraints (42) is,

[a, b] = [a, b] +

+

1

k i dzi dz[a, (z)](z, z)[tw (z), b]
k i dzi dz[a, tw (z)](z, z)[(z), b].

1

(52)

and satises [a, tw (z)] = 0 = [a, (z)] for any function a. since [(z), (z)] = 0 we
note, in particular, that [(z), (z)] = [(z), (z)]. furthermore, ln[] only depends on
 and thus [ln[], lm[]] = [ln[], lm[]] = [ln, lm]. this last equality is the crucial
one; the dirac bracket of the gauge-xed ln[] is the same as the dirac bracket of the
original ln before the constraints are imposed. finally, from [ln, tw ] = 0, it is clear that
[ln, lm] = [ln, lm]. the bracket [ln, lm] is easy to compute [8] and we nd the desired
result,

[ln[], lm[]] = (n  m)ln+m[] +

c
12

n(n2  1)n+m,0

(53)

with central charge c = 6kp.

v. string dynamics and three-dimensional gravity

it was pointed out in section iv that the imposition of constraints such as worldsheet
dieomorphism invariance, naturally reduces the worldsheet ane symmetry to a virasoro
algebra generated by a liouville stress tensor. it was also pointed out that this reduction
has many similarities to the classical liouville reduction, which appears in 3d gravity [18].
in this section, we shall explore this correspondence, and show that the reduction procedures
are indeed equivalent. for this purpose, we shall consider a three-dimensional manifold m
whose boundary,

w = m,

(54)

is to be identied with the string worldsheet (see fig. 2).

  

w = m

  

target : (, , )

m : (, z, z)

fig. 2. a schematic representation of the embedding of the worldsheet, w = m into the
target. the upper embedding, corresponding to long strings is the sector which we shall focus
on here.

we will show that a gravitational theory on m, with anti-de sitter boundary conditions
on w , is equivalent to the dynamics of the free worldsheet action (4). of course, a key step
in obtaining this result is the fact that three-dimensional gravity does not have any bulk
degrees of freedom and all the dynamics lives at the boundary.

in order to demonstrate this classical equivalence, we rst recall the analysis of [18],
which we shall adapt here to the euclidean signature case. recall that the euclidean chern-
simons formulation of 3d gravity contains two elds aa and aa which are complex conjugate.
we may introduce the anti-hermitian sl(2,c) generators ja and dene a = aaja and
a = aaja = a. under the chiral boundary conditions az = 0, a
z = 0, and denoting
z = x1 +ix0, the einstein-hilbert action may be written in hamiltonian chern-simons form,

i[a, a] = (cid:20)izm

(a a + a0f ) +zw

action has well-dened variations. note that both boundary terms enter the action with the
0 = ia
same sign because the boundary conditions az = 0, a

z = 0 imply a0 = ia1 and a

18

solving the constraint f = 0 = f  on a manifold without nontrivial cycles we get

a = g1dg, a = dg(g)1. the action then reduces to two chiral wzw actions [34]

i[g, g] = (cid:20)iicw zw (g) +z (g11g)2(cid:21) +(cid:20)iicw zw (g) +z ((g)11g)2(cid:21) .

(56)

we now implement the reduction to a single non-chiral wzw model via the argument of
[18], in which the action (56) reduces to

i = iw zw [h],

h = gg.

(57)

more precisely, one may refer to [35] for the details of this reduction in the abelian case6,
and [18] for the non-abelian case. note that the equations of motion for the chiral theories
are g = 0, g = 0 7. the equations for the non-chiral theory are (h1h) = 0 whose
general solution is h = a(z)b(z). if we further impose h = h (from (57)) it follows that
a = b.

the non-chiral theory has two ane currents

j = h1h,

j = hh1

(58)

which are both conserved thanks to the equations of motion.
if we write h in the form
h = gg with g = 0 and g = 0, then j = g1g and j = g(g)1, as expected. this
means that the currents j and j appearing in the non-chiral theory are indeed the same
currents which appear in the chiral theories.

the interesting aspect of this analysis is that since g and g take values in sl(2, c)
and the combination h = gg is hermitian, then h  sl(2, c)/su(2). the theory is then
precisely the coset wzw model describing a string propagating on three-dimensional anti-de
sitter space. using the iwazawa decomposition for sl(2, c)

g = u   e/2

(59)

where u  su(2),    and   c, we obtain the expression (3) for h = gg. the
non-chiral wzw action (57) reduces in this parametrization to the worldsheet lagrangian
(4), thus verifying the following classical relation,

7actually, the equations are 1( g) = 0 but in this situation one normally assumes that 1 is

where the left hand side is the three-dimensional einstein-hilbert action (written in chern-
simons form), the right hand side is the string action propagating on euclidean ads3, and
we have restored the normalization where kg = l/(4g3). the key step in this identication
is that the three-dimensional gravitational theory is dened on a manifold m whose two-
dimensional boundary w is identied with the string worldsheet.

therefore, the sl(2, c)/su(2) wzw model has two dierent classical interpretations:
(i) as a string theory propagating on ads3; and (ii) as a gravitational theory in a three-
dimensional manifold whose boundary is identied with the string worldsheet. strictly, we
are being a little imprecise in our interpretation since on one hand, a string worldsheet
requires additional constraints such as worldsheet dieomorphism invariance, while on the
gravitational side, one needs to impose the brown-henneaux boundary conditions. thus, to
make this relation complete we need to take these constraints into account, and a priori it is
not at all clear that they are the same. nonetheless, we shall now argue that the reduction
conditions imposed by these constraints are indeed equivalent.

we analyzed the reduction of the worldsheet ane currents in accordance with the string
constraints in section iii.a, nding that the remaining current could be chosen as (j 3)
which took the form (46) and generated a virasoro algebra with central charge c = 6k. in
contrast, as shown in [18], the gravitational constraints are,

j 3 = 0,

j  = k,

(61)

which ensure that the asymptotic metric satises the anti-de sitter boundary conditions [1].
let us study what happens if we impose the string theoretic constraints (42) in the
gravitational theory. to understand the eect of the constraints (42) on the gravitational
variables, it is necessary to recall the general solution of the gravitational equations contain-
ing all currents j a. this solution can easily be found using the chern-simons formulation.
the general at connection, solving the chern-simons eld equations and satisfying the
boundary condition az = 0, can be written in the form (see [21] for more details),

az = b1a(z)b,
az = 0,
a = b1b

(62)

where b depends only on an additional radial coordinate . this solution has an ane
symmetry,

aa(z)  aa(z) + da(z),

(63)

where d =  + [a(z), ] is the holomorphic covariant derivative. in our parametrization, this
symmetry is generated by the currents (5) which are related to a(z) as follows,

aa =

j a
k

.

20

(64)

incorporating the other chirality one obtains a solution for the full chern-simons equa-
tions, and thus a solution for the gravitational equations. this solution depends on 6
a
arbitrary functions, aa(z) and a

(z), and can be written in the convenient form,

ds2 = a+adz2  a+ adz2 + (a a+e2 + a+ ae2)dzdz

+(d + a3dz + a3dz)2.

(65)

it is easy to show that this metric has constant curvature as required. to simplify the
notation, we shall assume that the anti-holomorphic side is trivial, which means that we
impose the conditions a+ = 1, a3 = 0, and a = 0, in the metric (65). with these
simplications, the metric takes the form,

ds2 = (a+a  (a3)2)dz2 + ae2dzdz + d2 + 2a3dzd.

(66)

we now proceed to consider the reduction of this metric under the constraints specied in
(61) and (42):

1. in the conventional reduction in 3d gravity [18] one imposes the constraints (61) in
order to satisfy the brown-henneaux boundary conditions. the metric then takes the
form (25) with t = ka+ = j +. on substituting the representation for the currents
(5) one nds

j + = 

()2 s k

2

1
2

2,

(67)

as expected for a liouville stress tensor generating the virasoro algebra with central
charge8 c = 6k.

2. alternatively, we may also reduce via the constraints (42), obtaining the metric

ds2 = e2dzdz + d2 + 2a3dzd.

(68)

this line element is not of the brown-henneaux form (25). however, one can correct
the coordinate z with a term which is subleading for large ,

z  z + e2a3(z).

(69)

replacing this back into the metric (68), the cross term cancels out, and we obtain,

ds2 = a3dz2 + e2dzdz + d2,

(70)

which has the desired form (25) with t = ka3 = j 3. this is in full consistency
with the string reduction (42) where we showed that the combination j 3 played
the role of reduced virasoro operator with c = 6k, and in the representation (5) took
the liouville form (46).

8one may check this via use, for example, of the free-eld commutators for the currents (5).
alternatively, if one uses the ane algebra, then the reduction is performed via dirac brackets
by regarding the conditions (61) as a set of second class constraints. see [36] and [21] for explicit
calculations.

21

this analysis indicates that dieomorphism invariance on the worldsheet is equivalent to
the brown-henneaux boundary conditions for the associated three-dimensional theory. the
sets of constraints (61) and (42) are therefore closely related. one way in which this relation
may be seen is to view the common constraint, specically  = j   k, as a rst class
constraint, since it commutes with itself. this point was noted earlier in section iv. one
may show that if this is the only constraint imposed in (66), one still obtains a correction to
the metric, given by k((a3)2 + a3  a+), which in terms of the elds is given by a liouville
stress tensor. this supports the idea that the constraint tw = 0, or alternatively j 3 = 0,
acts like gauge xing condition for the symmetry generated by the rst class constraint
 = j   k  0.
in interpreting this correspondence, it is natural to assume as we have throughout our
analysis that k is large since this is the regime of large curvatures and one may use the low
energy eective action for the string, which in the metric sector indeed coincides with the
3d einstein-hilbert action, plus a cosmological constant. however, one can also think of
studying the exact worldsheet theory [8,12] in the regime where k is small. since k  1/,
this implies that the string eective action should possess large  corrections, and thus the
possibility of a relation to pure gravitational dynamics in this regime looks quite nontrivial.

vi. discussion

in this paper we have explored several aspects of string dynamics on ads3. our main focus
has been on trying to understand the realization of brown-henneaux dieomorphisms within
the worldsheet picture, and their relation to ane symmetries of the worldsheet action. the
connection between these symmetries is particularly clear in the long string sector, where
the asymptotic target space symmetry is realized as a symmetry of the worldsheet action.
one natural question to ask is whether this approach sheds any light on the black hole
entropy problem, as it was pointed out by strominger [2] that a unitary boundary cft,
realizing the brown-henneaux symmetry, could account for the microstates corresponding
to the semi-classical bekenstein-hawking entropy. we shall conclude in this section, by
making a few remarks on this issue.

if we focus for a moment on the long string sector, then it is natural to identify the
brown-henneaux central charge with that obtained within the worldsheet theory [8], with
the result,

c0 =

3l
2g3

= 6kp,

(71)

where we recall that l is the scale of the geometry, and g3 is the 3d newton constant. as
recalled earlier, the eective gravitational dynamics associated with the brown-henneaux
boundary conditions is given by liouville theory [18] with central charge c0. we have seen
here that the dynamics of the long string sector is described by a worldsheet liouville theory
with central charge c = c0/p = 6k. both theories have an eective level density equivalent
to a free boson.

it is intriguing to ask what the level density is in a sector of p coincident long strings. a
naive estimate, based on considering liouville theory on a multiple cover of the boundary
would suggest a level density associated with p free bosons. this is also the result we obtain

22

from considering the algebra (51), where we nd q0 = pl0, which implies that the spacetime
generators ln form a subalgebra of the qns. this mechanism has been explored in [32] and
[33] within pure three-dimensional gravity. in the present case, since the worldsheet central
charge is c = c0/p = 6k, there is a unitarity bound on p, given by p  c0, or somewhat
smaller if we take into account the quantisation of k through its interpretation as the 5-
brane charge. for comparison, we know that a unitary cft realising the density of states
associated with the btz black hole, would also have a level density equivalent to c0 free
bosons [2].

of course, this discussion is merely suggestive, as the sector with p coincident long strings
apparently requires a second quantised desription for a complete analysis. nevertheless, an
interesting corollary is that in the sector with the highest degeneracy, k is of order one, (and
thus we need to assume p is large in order that we may ignore quantum corrections  the

string coupling is g2  1/pk). while this regime is beyond the scope of this paper, we
note that for consistency the string scale is then of the same order as the ads3 radius, since
k = (l/ls)2  1 implies l  ls. this is appropriate for the long string sector if all uctuations
are on the scale of the characteristic ads3 size, implying that short strings are somehow not
excited.

if we are in a regime where all uctuations are at the ads3 scale l, then one can ask
how one should distinguish between unwound (short) and wound (long) strings. in recent
work [16], it has been suggested that this distinction may be associated with the presence
or otherwise of an abelian ux on the string worldsheet, via the description of the ns1/ns5
conguration within matrix string theory. it was also suggested there that the multiply-
wrapped case in the long string sector (p > 1) should indeed be interpreted as p wrapped
strings. as discussed above, this naturally implies the necessity for a second quantized
framework, or matrix string theory. some generalization of this or a related kind seems
necessary in order to describe the short and long string sectors in a unied manner.

another issue, closely related to the speculations above, is whether the spectrum arising
from the dynamics of long strings is in fact related to the spectrum of black holes. one hint
in this direction is that liouville theory is known to possess a threshold in the spectrum
beyond which it is continuous. this threshold can be deduced directly from the coecient
of the improvement term in the stress tensor (e.g. (46)). one nds [13],

 

k
4 

c
24

,

(72)

which is the ramond-ramond ground state, associated with zero-mass extreme black holes.
thus it would be nice to associate the continuum above this threshold with the spectrum
of black holes. for some work on the identication of black hole states in the eective
boundary liouville theory of pure gravity see [38]. examination of the elliptic genus [39]
(see also [40]) also suggests that the ability of supergravity to match the spectrum via
the ads/cft correspondence breaks down at this threshold, implying the need for stringy
corrections.
