one imposes condition (2.2) spinors, one gets parameters satisfy a(1) = e a(2) + ei ; a(2) = e a(1) + ei (4.77) compatible (4.71) (4.72), one needs exp(cid:16)i(cid:16) + (1) then, topological charge

speed without dispersion keep form scattering, eect phase shift displacement position. show solitons working true solitons indeed fulll requirements. shall calculate so-called time delays scattering two solitons, using procedures {$9408074$}. consider two solitons distant past well apart, colide near = 0 separate distant future. therefore, except region scattering occurs, solitons free travel constant velocity. let us denote trajectories one solitons collision (since velocity same) lateral displacement xed time measured x = vt + x(i) x = vt + x(f ) time delay dened (x) x(f ) x(i) (t) t(f ) t(i) = (x) v (4.80) (4.81) (4.82) intercepts trajectories time axis given t(f ) = x(f )/v t(i) = x(i)/v. lateral displacement time delay lorentz invariant, consider invariant (4.83) e(x) = p(t) e p = energy momentum soliton respectively. since e positive follows (x) sign reference frame, strength frame dependent. time delay hand may change sign lorentz transformations. one show lateral displacements time delays two solitons participating collision satisfy {$9408074$} e11(x) + e22(x) = 0 ; p11(t) + p22(t) = 0 (4.84) 2 2 (t) = (comf) 2 1 (comf) 2 (t). therefore, (4.83) e(comf) sub-indices labeling quantities associated particle i. notice therefore that, since energies positive, lateral displacements opposite signs. clearly, center momentum frame (comf), p1 + p2 = 0, time delays equal, i.e. (comf) (x)/p1 = e(comf) (t). consequently, since (x) sign frame, follows that, particle 1 moves right faster particle 2 (such p1 positive cmof), (1(x)), 2(x), (comf) (t) sign. physical interpretation sign related character (attractive repulsive) interaction forces. indeed, force attractive particle 1 accelerate approaches particle 2 decelerate. means 1(x) positive common sign negative. therefore, attractive forces lead negative time delay (t) = (comf) (x)/p1 = (comf) 1 (t) (comf) (comf) 1 1 2 1 21 center momentum reference frame, clearly repulsive forces positive time delay. considerations assume two particles pass other, reection. however, masses two particles equal possibility occurring reection. let us evaluate time delays two-soliton solutions given (4.41)-(4.46). choose particle 1 move faster right particle 2, i.e. v1 > v2, v1 > 0, therefore (4.28) (4.29) | z1 |<| z2 | 1 < 2. track soliton 1 time {$9408074$}, i.e. hold x v1t xed time varies. one gets x v2t = const. + (v1 v2)t, const. = x v1t. get that, 2 = 1, e2(z2) 0 , e2(z2) . case 2 = 1 limits get interchanged. therefore, taking 2 = 1, one check solution (4.41)-(4.46) becomes, limit , one-soliton solution (4.35) identications a(1) z1 z. now, limit , one also verify ratios 0/1, r/0, l/1, er/1 el/0 solutions (4.41)-(4.46) tend corresponding ratios one-soltion solution (4.35)

one observes direction arrow (4.86) reverses. therefore, using (4.81), (4.28) (4.29) one sees lateral displacement soliton 1 given 1(x) = 12 cosh 1 e(12)/2 + 12e(12)/2!2 ln e(12)/2 12e(12)/2 (4.87) (4.88) since 12 = 1, one observes 1(x) fact independent signs, 1(x) = 1 cosh 1 ln tanh 1 2 2 !!2 notice solutions (4.41)-(4.46) symmetric interchange indices 1 2 parameters a(i) zi. therefore, track
