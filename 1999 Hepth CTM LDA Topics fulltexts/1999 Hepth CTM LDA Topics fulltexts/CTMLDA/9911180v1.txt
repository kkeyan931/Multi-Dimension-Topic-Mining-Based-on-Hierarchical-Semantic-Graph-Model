1 introduction

theories of extended supergravity in various dimensions possess rigid sym-
metries. a subgroup of these symmetries can be gauged by the vector elds
present in the theory. for example, in n = 2 supergravity in ve dimensions,
one can gauge the u(1) subgroup of the su(2) rigid symmetry group of the
theory [1]. gauged supergravity theories exist in higher dimensions in which
supersymmetry allows the existence of a cosmological constant.
it is well
known that a cosmological constant is not allowed in d = 11, d = 10 and
d = 9. in d = 7, su(2) and so(5)  so(5) gauged supergravity theories
were constructed in [2] and [3] respectively.

the theories of gauged supergravity theories in d = 4, 5, 7 are believed
to be related to certain compactications of d = 10, 11 supergravity the-
ories. for instance, the four dimensional gauged n = 8 supergravity [4]
is conjectured to be related to the compactication of eleven dimensional
supergravity on s7 [5]. however, this conjecture has not been veried yet
and usually it is dicult to nd a consistent ansatz for compactication on
spheres. toroidal compactication of ten dimensional supergravity to four
dimensions yields an n = 4 supergravity theory with six vector multiplets
[6]. the vector and matter elds obtained in four dimensions are in gen-
eral linear combinations of the internal components of the ten dimensional
metric and antisymmetric tensor. the truncation is then performed by iden-
tifying the vector components of the ten-dimensional metric with those of
the antisymmetric tensor. another known compactications of ten dimen-
sional supergravity are due to scherk and schwarz [7], in which the internal
compactied space is taken to be a group manifold. the maximal group
manifold allowed is s3  s3 and a compactication of this particular case
for the dual formulation of supergravity was performed in [8]. the result-
ing four dimensional theory is an n = 4 supergravity with a non-compact
gauge group containing the factor su(2)  su(2). in order to obtain the
friedman-schwarz model [9], a compactication of the sherck-schwarz type
is needed. this compactication was performed recently in [10]. the crucial
point in this analysis is the specic relation between the components of the

2

metric and antisymmetric tensor along the internal dimensions. this was a
long standing problem, the main diculty was nding the right ansatz for
the antisymmetric tensor eld. it was suggested by the authors of [11] that
a more complicated six dimensional internal manifold is needed in order to
obtain the friedman-schwarz model. this suggestion was motivated by the
general result of friedman, gibbons and west [12] that non-trivial compact-
ications of ten-dimensional supergravity are inconsistent. this proved not
to be the case as a basic assumption made in [12] regarding the dilaton eld
needs to be violated.

in recent years, there has been a renewed interest in gauged supergravity
theories. this is mainly due to the recently conjectured duality between su-
pergravity and super yang mills [13]. since this conjecture has been made,
anti-de sitter spaces have received a great deal of interest. the purpose of
our work here is to demonstrate that d = 7, n = 2, su(2)-gauged super-
gravity theory of [2] can be obtained via dimensional reduction of n = 1 ten
dimensional and eleven dimensional supergravity theories.

2 dimensional reduction and d = 7 gauged

supergravity

in this section we will show explicitly how to obtain the seven dimensional
gauged supergravity of [2] as a dimensionally reduced ten dimensional n = 1
supergravity theory. the internal space is taken to be the group manifold
su(2).

the bosonic part of n = 1 supergravity action in ten dimensions is

our notations are as follows. ten-dimensional quantities are denoted by hat-
ted symbols. base space and tangent space indices are denoted by late and
early capital latin letters, respectively. we rst comment briey on the com-
pactication of ten-dimensional supergravity on s3  s3 to four dimensions.

for four-dimensional space-time indices, late and early greek letters de-
note base space and tangent space indices, respectively. similarly, the inter-
nal base space and tangent space indices are denoted by late and early latin
letters, respectively.

{m} = { = 0, . . . , 3; m = 1, . . . , 6},

{a} = { = 0, . . . , 3; a = 1, . . . , 6}.
(2)
the general coordinates xm consist of spacetime coordinates x and internal
coordinates zm. the at lorentz metric of the tangent space is chosen to be
(+,, . . . ,) with the internal dimensions all spacelike. thus the metric is
related to the vielbein by

gm n = ab ea

m eb

n =  e

m e

n  abea

m eb

and the antisymmetric tensor eld strength is

hm n p = m bn p + n bp m + p bm n .

the coordinates zm span the internal compact group space, implying that
we have the functions u a

m(z) satisfying the condition

(5)

here fabc are the group structure constants and the internal space volume is
m|dz. in the maximal case, i. e., su(2)  su(2), each s3 factor

admits invariant 1-form a = a

(7)

where g is a coupling constant, then the structure constants will be given
in terms of the coupling constant by fabc = gabc. for the case where the
coupling constant of one of the su(2) factors vanishes, the internal space

4

becomes the group manifold su(2)  [u(1)]3. in order to get a consistent
truncation, one must set six vector multiplets to zero. this is done by identi-
fying the six gauge elds coming from the components of the metric with six
vector elds from the components of the antisymmetric tensor. in order to
do this identication the vectors coming from the antisymmetric tensor must
behave like yang-mills gauge elds, and here is the main source of diculty.
it is crucial to have the right ansatz for the antisymmetric tensor to get a
consistent truncation.

we now turn to the compactication of ten-dimensional supergravity the-
ory down to seven dimensions. the three dimensional internal space is taken
to be the su(2) group manifold. we shall show that the obtained theory is
the su(2) gauged seven dimensional supergravity theory derived in [2]. fol-
lowing scherk and schwarz [7], we parameterize the vielbein in the following
form

where we have set  = 1 and rescaled the gauge elds by 1

. the lagrangian in (18) can be seen to be identical to

the lagrangian (19) contains a three-form a instead of the two-form
b appearing in (18). these forms are, however, related by a duality trans-
formation. to see this we add to the seven dimensional compactied action
in (18) the term

and assume that h is not the eld strength of b but an independent eld.
the equation of motion of a then implies that h is the eld strength of

7

a two form b. on the other hand, now the h appears quadratically and
linearly in the lagrangian, the gaussian integration of h can be carried
out resulting in the terms

integrating the last term by parts and using the identity

one obtains the chern-simons term

and this is seen to agree with the lagrangian in (19) after integrating by
parts2.

we note in passing that the seven dimensional lagrangian can also be
obtained by compactifying eleven dimensional supergravity and then trun-
cating. this can be seen by embedding the ten-dimensional supergravity into
eleven-dimensional supergravity after truncating half the degrees of freedom.
one has the following identications for the eleven dimensional elds:

this identication is important in lifting special solutions from seven to ten
and eleven dimensions.

2the dierent signs for the kinetic terms as well as the i factor appearing with the

epsilon tensor in (19) are due to the choice of the metric (+ + + + + + +) in [2]

we now comment on previous work that appeared in the literature. first
in the work of du, townsend and van niewenhuizen [11] a compactication
of ten dimensional supergravity on s3 was given, but this breaks all super-
symmetries. more recently, lu and pope [14] gave an ansatz for the reduction
and truncation of eleven dimensional supergravity to seven dimensions. their
ansatz was shown to be consistent by checking that the equations of motion
for eleven dimensional supergravity are satised. when, however, the ansatz
was substituted into the eleven-dimensional action, the lagrangian (19) was
not obtained.

in this work we have not given the ansatz for the reduction of the fermionic
parts. this should be straightforward but tedious. the fact that bosonic part
of the supergravity lagrangian xes completely the fermionic parts as well,
implies that the fermionic terms have also to agree.
