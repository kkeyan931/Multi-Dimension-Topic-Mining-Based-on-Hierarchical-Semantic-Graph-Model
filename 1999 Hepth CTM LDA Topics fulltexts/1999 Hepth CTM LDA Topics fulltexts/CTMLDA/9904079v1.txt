abstract

a generalization of scalar electrodynamics called uid electrody-
namics is presented. in this theory a uid replaces the higgs scalar
eld. fluid electrodynamics might have application to the theory of
low temperature helium superuids, but here it is argued that it pro-
vides an alternative method of approaching symmetry breaking in par-
ticle physics. the method of constructing uid electrodynamics is to
start with the velocity decomposition of a perfect uid as in general
relativity. a unit vector tangent to the ow lines of an isentropic uid
can be written in terms of scalar potentials: va = h1(a + a  s).
a novel interacting charged uid can be obtained by applying the co-
variant derivative: da = a + ieaa to these scalar potentials. this
uid is no longer isentropic and there are choices for which it either
obeys the second law of thermodynamics or not. a mass term of the
correct sign occurs for the a term in the stress, and this mass term
depends on the potentials in the above vector. the charged uid can
be reduced to scalar electrodynamics and the standard approach to
symmetry breaking applied; alternatively a mass can be induced by
the uid by using just the thermodynamic potentials and then xing
at a critical point, if this is taken to be the bose condensation point
then the induced mass is negligible.

introduction.

in particle physics elds are given mass by assuming the existence of higgs
scalar elds. there are a number of unsatisfactory aspects to this procedure,
for example: the higgs scalar has not been experimentally found, also it is
required to have a mass term of the wrong sign. an alternative procedure has
been suggested, roberts (1989) [1] in which uids rather than scalar elds
are responsible for vector elds acquiring mass. the motivation for using
uids is a principle [1] which states that there is only one concept of mass in
physics; furthermore this concept of mass must be ultimately of gravitational
origin. the picture envisaged can be thought of as occurring in four steps or
stages, these words have unwanted temporal connotations so that we refer
instead to four basic ingredients. the rst ingredient is that the vector eld
is taken to exist, and it is assumed to have a primitive stress. the second
ingredient is that the vector eld has statistical properties which produce
an eective uid that couples to the primitive stress. the third ingredient
is that the coupling between the uid and the primitive stress produces a
mass term. the fourth ingredient is that the gravitational origin of this

2

is in some as yet undiscovered relationship between statistical mechanics and
gravitational theory. those of a more prosaic disposition can simply regard
uids as an alternative technical means for inducing mass, perhaps with ap-
plication in the theory of superuids, isreal (1981) [22]. scalar elds and
uids can be equated in several ways as shown for example in [1]. usually
uids exhibit more freedom as they are parameterised by p, , va however
static scalar elds are equivalent to uids with imaginary vector va so that
there are sometimes dierent qualitative properties, an example of this is
the asymptotic properties, roberts (1998) [2]of the space-time. the techni-
cal methods in [2], uses what in section 2 is called the already interacting
uid. here the technical procedure is to replace derivatives in the velocity
decomposition of the uid tangent vector va by vector covariant derivatives.
the resulting covariantly interacting uid can be reduced to scalar elec-
trodynamics, and then the standard symmetry breaking procedure applied.
the covariantly interacting uid generalizes scalar electrodynamics and the
extra degrees of freedom provide the scope for other symmetry breaking
mechanisms to be used. one mentioned here requires that only quantities
of thermodynamic importance be retained in the mass breaking term, these
thermodynamic quantities can then be xed at a critical value such as the
bose condensation value. the drawback of this approach in its present form
is that it necessitates the introduction of an ad hoc time interval; here this is
taken to be the planck time. it is found that the induced mass is negligible,
i.e. well beneath the experimental limit of 1050kg. [3]. it is of interest to
know if it could be demonstrated that the photon mass is exactly zero. the
proca equation [4] p.135 necessitates m2aaa = 0, so that the existence
of photon mass xes the gauge. the bohm-aharonov eect [5] shows that
the gauge must be chosen such that aa is continuous; it might be possible
to devise a geometric conguration in which the continuity of aa requires a
dierent gauge choice from aaa = 0, thus giving m = 0 from m2aaa = 0.
in this paper section 2 briey introduces the standard scalar electrodynamic
symmetry breaking, section 3 introduces the velocity decomposition for the
velocity tangent to a uid, section 4 applies the vector covariant deriva-
tive to this, section 5 mentions some possible ways in which the resulting
uid could break symmetry. the conventions used are: signature  + ++,
;  signies christoel covariant derivative, symmetrization is denoted by
round brackets, e.g. t(ab) = (tab + tba)/2, anti-symmetrization is denoted
by square brackets, e.g. t[ab] = (tab  tba)/2.

the requirement that the corresponding quantum theory is renormizable

restricts the potential to the form

a newtonian 3-vector, can be decomposed:  =  + , [8] where , ,
and  are the clebsch potentials. a particular case of pas theorem shows
that a 4-vector can be decomposed: va = aba + cda where a, b, c, and
d are the potentials. the work of [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] shows that a non-
minimal decomposition

va = h1(a + a  sa),

vav a

. = 1

(17)

is more useful, because for an isentropic uid all the potentials have evolution
equations.  is the thermasy of van dantzig [14]eq.4.9 it is usually dened
by

d = kt d,

(18)

where t is the temperature; also h is the enthalpy and s is the entropy.
the three other potentials do not have a thermodynamic interpretation. a
current vector can be dened by

wa = hva,

(19)

c.f.[7]p.69, because w a
of wa can be in the usual manner [7]p.82-3

.;a = 0 it is not conserved. the christoel derivative

wa;b = ab + ab +

hab  wawb,

(20)

and then dening the vorticity tensor, vorticity vector, expansion tensor,
expansion scalar, shear tensor, and acceleration vector in the usual manner,
it is found that only the vorticity tensor, expansion scalar, and acceleration
vector show any simplication, they are

respectively, where the projection tensor is given by

hab = gab  vavb,

(21)

(22)

and the evolution equations 29 have been used in deriving the equation for
the acceleration wa.

6

the evolution equations can be derived from a lagrangian; to do this it

is necessary to assume both the equation

nh = p + ,

(23)

where n is the particle number, p is the pressure, and  is the density, and
also the rst law of thermodynamics in the form

dp = n dh  nt ds.

(24)

usually [15] the the lagrangian of a uid is taken to be the pressure, this
is done here; but occasionally. e.g.[7]p.69, other quantities are used. the
action is

i = z gp dx.

(25)

using 24 and then 17 shows that variations in the pressure depend on the
velocity potentials. the variations are

i
gab = nhvavb,
i


= g(nv a);a,
= gnava,
= g(nv a);a,
= +gnsava,
= g[(nv a) + nt ].

the rst of these variations give the stress

the absolute derivative is given by

xab... =

xab... = v cxab...;c,

(26)

(27)

(28)

then the requirement that the second of the variations 26 vanishes is

n + nv a

.;a = 0,

(29)

and this is just the conservation of particle number [16]eq.2.3. using this
the vanishing of the remaining variations gives

 =  = s = 0,

 = t.

(30)

the third of these shows that the uid is isentropic, the fourth is just 18 in
another forms. using 17 and 30 shows that
 = h.

(31)

the bianchi identities give the uid conservation equations

..;b =  + (p + )v a

..;c = (p + )v bva;b + h b

a.p;b,

(32)

where the projection tensor is given by 21; these equations do not imme-
diately occur as a result of varying the lagrangian, but only by applying
the bianchi identities to 27. the rst law of thermodynamics has been as-
sumed 21. in the present case the second law is obeyed as an equality as in
30 s = 0. the situation is more complex in the next section. anticipating
some of the problems and how to approach them - in particle physics there is
not always invariance under time and space reections. the above involves
no inequalities: there are no assumed energy inequalities, and the uid is
isentropic (in equilibrium with s = 0) rather than s > 0. recall that a
vector is future pointing i vt > 0; for 17 hvt = t + t  st; ignoring
, , and , va is past pointing when st > 0. this can be reversed by
either dening a new vector v 

a = va or a new time coordinate t = t.

4 the covariantly interacting fluid.

there are several ways, four of which are mentioned here, of introducing an
interacting uid and vector eld, with the intention of breaking the vector
elds symmetries. in the rst method a plasma interacting uid is pro-
duced by generalizing the treatment of [10]#7. in the second method, the
uid is already interacting, the stress 26 is directly equated with the stress
calculated from 11; this gives 2(ab + 2e2babb) = ( + p)vavb and it

8

is impossible to proceed with one real uid; this method is similar to the
method discussed in [1]. the third method is the traditionally interact-
ing uid [7]p.70, this is produced by adding a term li =  1
2 vaaa to the
lagrangian; this method is of no use for present purposes as there is only
a single term aa in the lagrangian and stress, and for symmetry breaking
products aaab are required. the fourth method is the covariantly inter-
acting uid; this is a produced by simply applying the covariant derivative
2 to the vector 17 to produce

va = h1 (a + a  sa + ie( +   s)aa) .

it is required that

 1 = gab
and also that the projection tensor is

.. v(a

vb),

hab = gab  v(a

vb),

(33)

(34)

(35)

this ensures that most quantities are real. after using wa = hva, 34 becomes

h = gab

.. w(a

vb),

(36)

then via the rst law of thermodynamics 23 the pressure and the lagrangian
are real; however the expansion, shear, . . . etc. are complex, this can be
veried by direct computation or by noting from 20 that as wa is complex
the quantities involved in this decomposition should also be complex.

the evolution equations are derived in a similar manner to the derivation
in the last section. the action is taken to be 25 and the rst law of thermo-
dynamics is assumed with the enthalpy h now given by 36. the variations
of the action are

i

as],

36 and the vanishing of these give

 h = [a(v a

. ) + e2a2

a].

the stress and maxwell equation are

tab = (p + )v(a

vb) + p gab,

f ab

introducing the notation

xab... = (cid:18) d

d

a(cid:19) xab...,

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

38 and the vanishing of the variations 37 can be written in the simple form

 =  = s = 0,

 = h,

 = t,

n = n 6= 0.

(41)

changing the sign and index of the last term produces the changes in the
table. the uid has n 6== 0 implying that particle number is not conserved,
this appears unavoidable. our choice has  = t so that the standard ex-
pression for thermasy is recovered; also s = 0 implies that the second law
of thermodynamics is obeyed when s >  + .

5 symmetry breaking.

the straightforward way of proceeding to break symmetry is to note that
the covariantly interacting uid of the previous section contains scalar elec-
trodynamics as a special case. there are several choices of the parameters
by which scalar electrodynamics can be recovered, an example is

 =  =  = s = ah = 0,  = 2h,

p = lsel,  = 1  p,

(42)

in the gauge refeq:2.10. thus the standard way of breaking symmetry can
then be applied, with the aesthetic dierence the fundamental cause of
breaking is a uid not a eld. there is the possibility of other velocity
potentials such as  being non-vanishing operators leading to modications
of the standard treatment; the velocity potentials themselves have been sub-
ject to quantization for a uid coupled to gravity in the adm formalism,
see for example [17] [18] [19].

the proca equation [4]p.135 is

.. + m2eaa
f ab

. = 0,

comparing with (40, the covariantly interacting uid has a mass

m2 = h2( +   s)2.

(43)

(44)

choosing only to retain thermodynamic quantities m2 = h22s2, and the
thermasy  needs to be evaluated. the tempreture can be taken to be
independent of the proper time  , but the mass in 44 still depends on proper
time; to proceed it is necessary to introduce an articial time interval and
the plank time is chosen, thus

  = kz tap l

0

t d = kt z p l

0

11

d = kt |p l

0 = s gh

c5 kt.

(45)

restoring constants and substituting into 44 gives

m = s ch

g

k

t s

h  3.1031 t s

h

kg.

(46)

for m to be constant it is necessary to evaluate t s/h at the critical point
and the bose condensation point is a choice. this choice terms out to give
zero mass because bose condensation requires that the lowest state has zero
kinetic energy, as there is no extra energy there is no extra heat content and
hence no entropy, there is no disorder because all the particles are in the
same state, c.f.[20]p.78, no entropy implies that there is no induced mass.
the bose condensation point is also unsatisfactory choice because strictly
speaking n/v is not required to have a given value for radiation in a cavity
for a vector elds, c.f.[21]prob.16.2.
