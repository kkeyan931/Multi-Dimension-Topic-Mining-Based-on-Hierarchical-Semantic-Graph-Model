the action-angle variables for n -particle hamiltonian system with the hamilto-
n=0 ln sh2 (pn/2) + ln ((xn  xn+1)  (xn + xn+1)) , xn = x0, are
constructed, and the system is solved in terms of the riemann -functions. it is shown
that this system describes pole dynamics of the elliptic solutions of 2d toda lattice
corresponding to spectral curves dened by the equation w2  p el

1 introduction

the main goal of this paper is to construct the action-angle variables for a nite dimensional
hamiltonian system of the equations

xn = ( x2

n  1)(v (xn, xn+1) + v (xn, xn1), xn+n = xn,

where

v (u, v) = (u  v) + (u + v)  (2u) =

(u  v)  (u + v)
(u  v)  (u + v)

,

(1.1)

(1.2)

and identify it as an elliptic analog of n-periodic toda lattice. here (x) = (x|2, 2) and
(x) = (x|2, 2) are classical weierstrass functions.

recently, nite-dimensional integrable soliton systems have attracted very special inter-
est due to their unexpected relations to the theory of supersymmetric gauge models. the
celebrated seiberg-witten ansatz ([1, 2]) identies moduli space of physically non-equivalent
vacua of the model with moduli space of a certain family of algebraic curves. in [3, 4] it was
shown that the family of curves corresponding to four-dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric
su(nc) theory is dened by the equation

w2  wpnc(e) + 2nc = 0, pnc(e) = enc +

nc1xi=0

uiei.

(1.3)

in [5] it was noted that this family can be identied with the family of the spectral curves
of nc-periodic toda lattice, and the seiberg-witten ansatz was linked with the whitham
perturbation theory of nite-gap solutions of soliton equations proposed in [6, 7]. integrable
systems related to various gauge models coupled with matter hypermultiplets in various
representations were considered in [8]-[33], where more complete list of references can be
found.

in [32, 33] nc-periodic spin chain related to xy z model was proposed as soliton coun-
terpart of n = 1 supersymmetric su(nc) theory in six dimensions compactied in two di-
rections, and coupled with nf = 2nc matter hypermultiplets. spectral curves of nc-periodic
homogeneous xy z spin chain have the form

w2  wp el

nc(z) + qel

2nc(z) = 0,

(1.4)

nc(z) and qel

where p el
2nc(z) are elliptic polynomials, i.e. elliptic functions with poles of order
nc and 2nc at the point z = 0. note, that (1.4) is an elliptic deformation of the family
of curves found in [34] for four-dimensional n = 2 sypersymmetric su(nc) model coupled
with a matter hypermultiplets.

a particular case of (1.4), when qel

2nc(z) = 2nc can be seen as an
elliptic deformation of (1.3). the corresponding family of curves depends on nc parameters
which can be chosen as  and the coecients ui of the representation of p el

an attempt to nd a soliton system corresponding to a family of spectral curves dened by
the equation

w2  wp el

n (z) + 2n = 0,

(1.6)

led us to (1.1). after the system was found it turned out that, by itself, it is not new. up to
a change of variables qn = (xn), it coincides with one of the systems listed in [35], where a
classication of all toda type chains which have toda type symmetries was obtained. the
new results obtained in this work are: isomorphism of (1.1) with a pole system corresponding
to elliptic solutions of 2d toda lattice, a construction of the action-angle variables, and
explicit solution of the system in terms of the theta-functions.

in [16, 17] it was shown that a wide class of solutions of the seiberg-witten ansatz can
be described in terms of a special foliation on the moduli space of curves with punctures.
that allows one to consider such systems as reductions of 2d soliton equations. following
this approach, let us note, that (1.6) denes an algebraic curve  as two-sheeted cover of
the elliptic curve 0 with periods 2, 2. let p be preimagies on  of z = 0. according
to the construction of [36], any algebraic curve with two punctures generates a family of
algebro-geometric solutions to 2d toda lattice

(2

tt  2

xx)n = 4(cid:16)en+1n  enn1(cid:17) ,

(1.7)

parameterized by points of the jacobian j() of the curve.

in the next section we show that the algebro-geometric solutions n(x, t) corresponding
to  dened by (1.6) are periodic in n up to a constant shift, n = n+n + 2n ln , and
have the form

n(x, t) = n(t) + ln

(x  xn+1(t) + a)(x + xn+1(t) + a)

(x  xn(t) + a)(x + xn(t) + a)

.

(1.8)

substitution of (1.8) into (1.7) leads to equations (1.1) for xn(t).

it section 3 we construct a new lax representation for (1.1) and show that the spectral
curve dened by the lax operator has the form (1.6). we prove also, that if xn(t) is a
solution of (1.1) then there exist functions n(t) (unique up to the transformation n(t) 
n(t) + c1t + c2, ci = const), such that the functions n(x, t) of the form (1.8) satisfy (1.7).

the last section is devoted to the hamiltonian theory of system (1.1). equations (1.1)

are generated by the hamiltonian

h =

n 1xn=0

ln sh2 (pn/2) + ln ((xn  xn+1)  (xn + xn+1)) ,

(1.9)

and the canonical poisson brackets {pm, xn} = nm. we would like to emphasize that though
this hamiltonian structure can be easily checked directly, it was found by the author using
the algebro-geometric approach to hamiltonian theory of the lax equations proposed in
[16, 17] and developed in [39]. the main advantage of this approach is that it allows to
nd simultaneously the action-angle variables and a generating dierential which denes
low-energy eective prepotential.

note, that from the relation of system (1.1) to 2d toda lattice it is clear that degen-
eration of the elliptic curve 0 corresponds to a degeneration of this system to the toda
lattice. it would be quit interesting to consider this degeneration explicitly on the level of
the hamiltonian structure. we will consider this problem elsewhere.

2 elliptic solutions of 2d toda lattice

algebro-geometric solutions of 2d toda lattice were constructed in [36]. let  be a smooth
genus g algebraic curve with xed local coordinates z(q) in neighborhoods of two punctures
p  , z(p) = 0. then, for any set of g points 1, . . . , g in general position there exists
a unique function n(x, t, q) such that:

10. n(x, t, q), as a function of the variable q  , is meromorphic on  outside the

punctures p and has at most simple poles at the points s (if all of them are distinct);

20. in the neighborhoods of the punctures the function n has the form

n = zn

 e(xt)z1  xs=0

s (x, t)zs


! , +

0 = 1.

uniqueness of n implies that it satises the following system of linear equations

(t + x)n(x, t, q) = 2n+1(x, t, q) + vn(x, t)n(x, t, q),

(t  x)n(x, t, q) = 2cn(x, t)n1(x, t),

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

where the coecients are dened by the leading coecient 
help of the formulae:

0 of expansion (2.1) with the

vn = (t + x)n(x, t), cn = en(x,t)n1(x,t), n(x, t) = ln 

0 (x, t).

(2.4)

compatibility of (2.2) and (2.3) implies that n(x, t) is a solution of 2d toda lattice (1.7).

the function n(x, t, q) is called the baker-akhiezer function and can be explicitly ex-
pressed in terms of the riemann theta-function associated with a matrix of b-periods of
holomorphic dierentials on . the corresponding formula for n is as follows.

let us x a basis of cycles ai, bi, i = 1, . . . , g, on  with the canonical matrix of intersec-
tions: ai  aj = bi  bj = 0, ai  bj = ij. the basis of normalized holomorphic dierentials

j = ij. the b-periods of these dieren-
k. the basic vectors ek of c g and the vectors bk,
which are columns of the matrix b, generate a lattice b in c g. the g-dimensional complex

is called the jacobian variety of . a vector with the coordinates

j() = c g/b, b =x nkek + mkbk, nk, mk  z,

(2.5)

(2.6)

denes the abel map a :   j().

the riemann matrix has a positive-denite imaginary part. the entire function of g

variables z = (z1, . . . , zg)

(z) = (z|b) = xmz g

e2i(z,m)+i(bm,m),

is called the riemann theta-function. it has the following monodromy properties

(z + ek) = (z), (z + bk) = e2izkibkk (z).

(2.7)

the function (a(q) + z) is a multi-valued function of q. but according to (2.7), the zeros
of this function are well-dened. for z in a general position the equation (a(q) + z) = 0
has g zeros 1, . . . , g. the vector z and the divisor of these zeros are connected by the

relation z = ps a(s) + k, where k is the vector of riemann constants.

let us introduce normalized abelian dierentials d(x) and d(t) of the second kind.
they are holomorphic on  except at the punctures p. in the neighborhoods of p they
have the form

d(x) = d(z1

 + o(1)), d(t) = d(z1

 + o(1)).

normalized means that they have zero a-periods. the vectors of b-periods of these dieren-
tials we denote by 2iv and 2iw , i.e. the coordinates of the vectors v and w are equal
to

vk =

d(x), wk =

d(t).

(2.8)

2iibk

2iibk

let d(n) be a normalized abelian dierential of the third kind with simple poles at the
punctures p with residues 1. from the riemann bilinear relations it follows that the
vector of its b-periods satises the relation

uk =

2iibk

d(n) = a(p)  a(p+).

(2.9)

if we choose a branch of abelian integral (n) near p+ such that (n) =  ln z+o(z+). then
near p it has the form

(n) = ln z + i0 + o(z).

theorem 2.1 ([36]) the baker-akhiezer function is equal to

n(x, t, q) =

(a(q) + nu + xv + tw + z)(z)
(nu + xv + tw + z)(a(q) + z)

exp(cid:16)n(n) + x(x) + t(t)(cid:17) .

(2.10)

the function n(x, t) given by the formula

n(x, t) = ni0 + ln

((n + 1)u + xv + tw + z)

(nu + xv + tw + z)

(2.11)

is a solution of 2d toda lattice.

5

for a generic set of the algebro-geometric data the function n(x, t) given by (2.11) is a
quasi-periodic meromorphic function of all the variables (n, x, t). in [37] the solutions of 2d
toda lattice which are elliptic in the discrete variable n were considered. it was found that
dynamic of its poles coincides with the elliptic ruijsenaars-schneider system [38]. in this
paper we consider solutions that are elliptic in the variable x and are periodic in n.

the condition that n is elliptic in one of the variables is equivalent to the property
that the complex linear subspace in j() spanned by the corresponding directional vector
is compact, i.e. it is an elliptic curve 0. in the case of the x variable that means that the
vectors 2v,  = 1, 2, belong to the lattice b dened by (2.5):

2v =xk

n
k ek + m

k bk, n

k , m

k  z.

(2.12)

here and below 1 = , 2 =  are half-periods of the elliptic curve 0.

theorem 2.2 let  be a curve dened by equation (1.6) and let p be preimages on  of
the point z = 0 on the elliptic curve 0 with local coordinates in their neighborhoods dened
by the local coordinate z on 0. then the corresponding algebro-geometric solutions given by
formula (2.11) satisfy the relation

n+n (x, t) = n(x, t) + 2n ln ,

(2.13)

and have the form (1.8), i.e.

n(x, t) = n(t) + ln

(x  xn+1(t) + a)(x + xn+1(t) + a)

(x  xn(t) + a)(x + xn(t) + a)

.

the functions xn(t) dened by this representation enjoy equations (1.1). the functions n
satisfy the relation

where

4en1(t)n(t) =(cid:16)1  x2

n(t)(cid:17) w (xn, xn+1)w (xn, xn1),

w (u, v) =

(u  v)(u + v)

(2u)

.

(2.14)

(2.15)

proof. the rst statement of the theorem is a direct corollary of the uniqueness of the baker-
akhiezer function. the projection q = (w, z)    w denes w = w(q) as a function on
the curve. this function is holomorphic on  outside the puncture p+, where in has a pole of
order n, w = zn (1 + o(z)). at the point p it has zero of order n, w = 2n zn (1 + o(z)).
therefore, we have the equality

n+n (x, t, q) = w(q)n(x, t, q),

(2.16)

because the functions dened by its left and right hand sides have the same analytical
properties.

let us consider the functions

t(z) = e2(z)2z,  = ().

(2.17)

6

it is double-periodic and holomorphic on 0 except at z = 0. again, comparison of analytical
properties of the left and right hand sides proves the equality

n(x + 2, t, q) = t(z)n(x, t, q), q = (w, z).

(2.18)

the function en is dened as a ratio of the leading coecients of an expansions of n on two
sheets of . therefore, it does not change under the shifts x  x + 2 and consequently
is an elliptic function of the variable x. from (2.11) it follows that if we denote roots of the
equation (nu + xv + tw + z) = 0 in the fundamental domain of 0 by xj
n(t), j = 1, . . . , d,
then

en(x,t) = en(t)

.

(2.19)

(x  xj
(x  xj

n+1(t))
n(t))

dyj=1

our next step is to show that en has only two poles and zeros in 0.

lemma 2.1 the function (xv + ) corresponding to an algebraic curve  dened by (1.6),
as a function of the variable x is an elliptic theta-function of weight 2, i.e. it can be repre-
sented in the form

(xv + ) = r()(x  x1())(x  x2()).

(2.20)

proof. let us nd the coecients of expansion (2.12). the branching points z
are roots of the equations p el
cycles on it as follows:

i of  over 0
n (z) = n . therefore,  has genus n + 1. we choose ai, bi

ai, i = 1, . . . , n  1, are cycles around cuts between branching points z+
i and an and
an +1 are two preimages of a-cycle on 0. we assume that a and b-cycles on 0 correspond
to periods 2 and 2, respectively.

i , z

from the denition of the dierential d(x) it follows that

d(x) = d(cid:18)(z) 




z(cid:19) .

therefore, the coordinates of the vector v dened by (2.8) are equal to

vi = 0, i = 1, . . . , n  1, vn = vn +1 =

1

i(cid:18) 




(cid:19) =

.

(2.21)

(2.22)

comparing the vector of b-periods of d(x) with the vector (0, . . . , 0, 2, 2) of b-periods of
the dierential dz, considered as dierential on , we get

ibi

d(x) = 

i

2ibi

dz, i = 1, . . . , n + 1.

(2.23)

the a-periods of dz are equal (0, . . . , 0, 2, 2). therefore,

dz = 2(dh

n + dh

n +1),

where as before, dh
that

i are normalized holomorphic dierentials. from (2.23) we nally obtain

2v = bn  bn +1,

(2.24)

7

where bi are the vector of b-periods of dh

i . the monodromy properties of -function imply

((x + 2)v + z) = (xv + z), ((x + 2)v + z) = el(x)(xv + z),

(2.25)

where

l(x) = i (2x(vn + vn +1) + bn +1,n +1 + bn,n  bn,n +1  bn +1,n + 2zn +1 + 2zn )

using (2.22) we obtain

dl(x) = 

2i


dx.

(2.26)

the number d of zeros of the function (xv +) in the fundamental domain can be found by
integrating of the logarithmic derivative of this function over the boundary of the domain.
from (2.25) and (2.26) it follows that

d =

1

2iig0

d ln (xv + z) = 2.

(2.27)

the equality (2.20) is proved. it implies that the index j in (2.19) takes values j = 1, 2.
sums of zeros and poles of an elliptic function are equal to each other (modulo periods of
0). hence, xj

n(t) can be represented in the form

x1
n = xn(t) + a(t), x2

n(t) = x(t) + a(t).

(2.28)

in order to complete a proof of (1.8) we need only to show that a(t) does not depend on t.

let us substitute (2.19) into (1.7). the dierence of the left and right hand sides of (1.7)
n+1(t).

3 generating problem and lax representation

in this section we construct the lax representation for (1.1) following an approach proposed
in [40] and developed in [37, 41, 42] (see their summary in [39])). according to this approach
pole dynamics can be obtain simultaneously with its lax representation from a specic
inverse problem for a linear operator with elliptic coecients.

in the most general form this inverse problem is to nd linear operators with elliptic
coecients that have suciently enough double-bloch solutions. a meromorphic function
f (x) is called double-bloch if it has the following monodromy properties:

f (x + 2) = bf (x),  = 1, 2.

(3.1)

the complex numbers b are called bloch multipliers. (in other words, f is a meromorphic
section of a vector bundle over the elliptic curve.) it turns out that existence of the double-
bloch solutions is so restrictive that only in exceptional cases such solutions do exist.

the basis in the space of the double-bloch functions can be written in terms of the

fundamental function (x, z) dened by the formula

(x, z) =

(z  x)
(z)(x)

e(z)x.

(3.2)

from the monodromy properties of the weierstrass functions it follows that , considered
as a function of z, is double-periodic: (x, z + 2) = (x, z), though it is not elliptic in
the classical sense due to an essential singularity at z = 0 for x 6= 0. as a function of x, the
function (x, z) is double-bloch function, i.e.

(x + 2, z) = t(z)(x, z),

where t(z) are given by (2.17). in the fundamental domain of the lattice dened by 2
the function (x, z) has a unique pole at the point x = 0:

(x, z) = x1 + o(x).

(3.3)

from (3.3) it follows that a double-bloch function f (x) with simple poles xi in the funda-
mental domain and with bloch multipliers b (such that at least one of them is not equal
to 1) may be represented in the form:

f (x) =

nxi=1

ci(x  xi, z)ekx,

(3.4)

where ci is a residue of f at xi and (z, k) are parameters related by b = t(z) exp(2k).

now we are in position to present the generating problem for (1.1).

theorem 3.1 the equation

(t + x)n = 2n+1 + vn(x, t)n

(3.7)

has two linear independent double-bloch solutions with bloch multipliers t(z) (for some z),
i.e. solutions of the form

n(x, t) =

ci
n(x  xi

n(t), z)

(3.8)

2xi=1

if and only if the functions xn(t) satisfy equation (1.1).

if equation (3.5) has two linear independent solutions of the form (3.8) for some z, then

they exist for all values of z.

proof. let us substitute (3.8) into (3.5). the both sides of the equation are double-bloch
functions with the same bloch multipliers and with pole of order 2 at xi
n and simple pole
at xi
n+1. they coincide i the coecients of their singular parts at these points are equal to
each other. the equality of the coecients at (x  xi

note that (3.16) denes n(t) up to a constant shift n(t)  n(t)+g(t), which corresponds to
the gauge transformation n  egn of equation (3.5), and which does not eect equations
for xn.

proof. the right and the left hand sides of (3.13) are double-periodic functions of z that are
holomorphic except at z = 0, where they have the form o(z2) exp((xi
n)(z)). such
functions are equal if and only if the corresponding coecients at z2 and z1 are equal.
the equality of the coecients at z2 gives

which is fullled due to (3.9) (the second equality in (3.17) holds because v(x, t) is an elliptic
function of x and, therefore, a sum of its residues is equal to zero).

tt = [m0, t ].

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

proof. if xn(t) is periodic in n, then the corresponding matrix functions ln(t, z) and mn(t, z)
dened by (3.15) satisfy the relations

ln+n = ln, mn+n = mn + dt(ln i).

therefore, equation (3.14), tln = mn+1ln  lnmn, implies that

tt = dt(ln i) t + [m0, t ].

(4.4)

(4.5)

note, that if ti = 0 then (4.5) coincides with (4.3), and therefore, the second statement of
the lemma follows from the rst one.

equation (4.5) implies that the function

p (z) = ei(t)(tr t (t, z))

(4.6)

is time-independent.

matrix entries of ln are double-periodic functions that are holomorphic on 0 except at
z = 0. therefore, (tr t ) is also double-periodic and holomorphic on 0 outside z = 0. in
order to prove that this function is meromorphic on 0, it is enough to note that ln has the
form

where gn is a diagonal matrix, gn = diag [xn(z), xn(z)]. from (3.2) it follows that in the
neighborhood of z = 0

the last equality shows that (tr t ) is a monic elliptic polynomial p el
n (z). therefore, at z = 0
we have p (z) = ei(t)zn (1 + 0(z)). hence, i(t) is an integral of (1.1) because p (z) does
not depend on z. lemma is proved.

due to (4.3) a spectral curve  dened by the characteristic equation

r(w, z)  det (w  t (t, z)) = w2  (tr t )w + det t = 0

(4.12)

is time-independent.

lemma 4.2 the characteristic equation (4.12) has the form (1.3) .

proof. we already proved that (tr t ) has the form (1.5). the relation (x, z)(x, z) =
(z)  (x), which is equivalent to the addition formula for the weierstrass -function,
implies

det ln(t, z) = 22( x2

n  1) [(xn+1  xn)  (xn+1 + xn)] .

(4.13)

therefore, though ln(t, z) depends on z, its determinant does not depend on z. hence,
(det t ) is also z-independent. because it does not depend on t we identify 2n in (1.6) with

2n = det t (t, z) = 22n

equals

r(q) = t 12(z)(x0(0), z) +(cid:16)w  t 11(z)(cid:17) (x0(0), z).

(4.28)

the function r(q) has pole of degree n + 1 at p+ and pole of degree n at p. therefore,
it has 2n + 1 zeros.

let us show that n of these zeros are situated over roots of the equation t 12(z) = 0 on
one of the sheets of . indeed, if t 12(z) = 0 then eigenvalues w(z) of the monodromy matrix
are equal to t 11(z) or t 12(z). therefore, r = 0 at the points q = (t 11(z), z). equations
(4.27) imply that cn has no poles at these points. the poles s of cn(t, q) on  outside the
punctures p coincide with n + 1 other zeros of r(q) and do not depend on n and t. let
us prove now that they satisfy (4.18).

the function r(z) = r(q)r(q), where  : q  q is a permutation of sheets of , is a
well-dened function on 0 with a pole of degree 2n + 1 at z = 0. as it was shown above it
is divisible by t 12(z). therefore, the ratio r(z)/t 12(z) is an elliptic function with a pole of
degree n + 1 at z = 0 and zeros at the points z(s). divisors of zeros and poles of an elliptic
function are equivalent. therefore, (4.18) is proved.

from (4.7) it follows that the vector-function ecn = g1

xn+1 = el0

the vector-function xn(t) with the coordinates given by (4.22) satises the equation
n is dened in (4.8). that implies that in the neighborhood of p+
the vector-function cn(t, q) has the form stated in the theorem up to a time-dependent factor
f+(t, z). substitution of (4.19,4.20) into the equation tcn = mncn shows that tf = o(z).
therefore, the analytical properties of cn near p+ are established.

now we are going to prove by induction that at p equalities (4.19, 4.20), and (4.23)
hold. for n = 0 they are fullled by the normalization conditions. let us prove rst, that if
(4.19, 4.20), and (4.23) hold for n  n then

2n = ((xn+1 + xn)  (xn+1  xn)) sn + 1,1

hence,

a step of induction for equalities (4.19, 4.20) is proved. the same arguments show that if

if n 6= 0, then the last equality contradicts to the monodromy property ecn = wec0 = o(zn ).
therefore, n = 0, and then (4.30) shows that ecn+1 has zero of order n + 1 at p. therefore,
(4.23) does not hold then the vector ecn has zero of order (2n  n) which again contradicts
the relation ecn = o(zn ).

equalities (4.19, 4.20) near p are proved, possibly up to a time-dependent factor f(t, z).
their substitution into the equation tcn = mncn shows that tf = o(z) and completes a
proof of (4.19, 4.20), and (4.23).

let cn(z) be a matrix formed by the vectors cn(t, qi(z)) corresponding to two dierent
sheets qi(z) = (wi(z), z) of . this matrix is dened up to permutation of sheets. from
(4.19-4.23) it follows that in the neighborhood of z = 0

the correspondence which according to the above proved theorem assigns to each solution
xn(t) = xn+n (t) of (1.1) a set of algebro-geometric data: an algebraic curve  dened by (1.6)
and the divisor d = {1, . . . , n +1} is a direct spectral transform. the following statement
shows that the results of section 2, can be seen as the inverse spectral transform.

corollary 4.1 the solution

n(x, t, q) = c1

n(t, q)(x  xn(t), t) + c2

n(t, q)(x + xn(t), t)

(4.35)

of equation (3.5) is equal to n(x, t, q) = c(t)n(x, t, q), where n(x, t, q) is the baker-
akhiezer function corresponding to  and the divisor d of the poles of cn; the factor c(t) is
dened in (4.22).

all the solutions xn(t) of (1.1) have the form xn = 1

the equation

n(t) are roots of

(nu + xi

n(t)v + w t + z) = 0.

(4.36)

here (z) is the riemann theta-function corresponding to ; vectors u, v, w are dened by
(2.8, 2.9); vector z corresponds to the divisor d via the abel transform.

as follows from the theorem 4.1, the function n dened by (4.35) has the same analytical
properties on  as the function c(t)n. therefore, they coincide. equation (4.36) immedi-
ately follows from the formula (2.10) for n.

5 action-angle variables

until now we have not used the hamiltonian structure of equations (1.1). moreover, apriory
it is not clear why a system that has arisen as a pole system of elliptic solutions of the 2d
toda lattice is hamiltonian. a general algebro-geometric approach which allows to derive a
hamiltonian structure starting from the lax representation was proposed and developed in
[16, 17, 39].

the main goal of this section is to construct action-angle variables for (1.1). first of all,
let us summarize necessary results of the previous sections. a point (pn, xn) of the phase
space m of the system denes a matrix function ln(z) with the help of the formulae

(5.1)

(5.2)

this function denes the spectral curve  (with the help of (4.12)), and the divisor d of
poles 1, . . . , n +1 of the baker-akhiezer function cn(q) = (c1

n(q), c2

n(q))

cn+1(q) = ln(z)cn(q), cn (q) = wc0(q), q = (w, z)  ,

normalized by the condition

0(0, q)(x0, z) + c2

0(q)(x0, z) = 1.

(5.4)

the divisor d satises (4.18), i.e. denes a point of an odd part of the jacobian j p r() 
j(), which is dened as a ber of the projection

{1, . . . , n +1}  j() 7 2+ =xs=1

z(s)  0,

(5.5)

corresponding to + = 0. all the bers are equivalent and can be identied with the prym
variety of . note, that a shift of + corresponds to the shift x  x + a for the solution
(1.8) of 2d toda lattice.

the correspondence

(pn, xn)  m 7 {, d  j p r()}

(5.6)

is an isomorphism. the coecients (ui, ) of equation (1.6) are integrals of the hamiltonian
system (1.1). equations (1.1) on a ber over  of the map (5.6) are linearized by the abel
transform (2.6).

the main goal of this section is to construct the action variables that are canonically

conjugated to the coordinates 1, . . . , n 1,  :

k =

ak(s),  = n  n +1

(5.7)

on the prymmian j p r(). note, that + = n + n +1.

(5.10)

proof. first of all, following the approach proposed in [16] we dene a symplectic structure
on m in terms of the lax operator and its eigenfunctions. after that we will calculate it in
two dierent ways which immediately imply (5.10).

the external dierential ln(z) can be seen as an operator-valued one-form on m.
canonically normalized eigenfunction cn(q) of ln(z) is the vector-valued function on m.
hence, its dierential is a vector-valued one-form. let us dene a two-form  on m by the
formula

are used in the proof of the following lemma.

n (z). that implies that c 

lemma 5.1 the two-form  equals

 =

n +1xs=1

z(s)   ln w(s).

(5.16)

the meaning of the right hand side of this formula is as follows. the spectral curve by
denition arises with the meromorphic function w(q) and multi-valued holomorphic function
z(q). their evaluations w(s), z(s) at the points s dene functions on the space m, and
the wedge product of their external dierentials is a two-form on m.

proof. the dierential , dened by (5.12) is a meromorphic dierential on the spectral curve
(the essential singularities of the factors cancel each other at the punctures). therefore, the
sum of its residues at the punctures is equal to the sum of other residues with negative sign.
there are poles of two types.

first of all,  has poles at the poles s of cn. note that cn has pole of the second order

at s. taking into account that c 

n has zero at s we obtain

ress =< c 

n+1lncn > z(s).

from (5.3) and (5.13) it follows that

value of an operator < c 

0 wc0 >, we obtain that

0 t c0 >=< c 

ress =  ln w(s)  z(s).

(5.19)

the second set of poles of  is a set of the branching points qi of the cover. the pole of
c 
n at qi cancels with the zero of the dierential dz, dz(qi) = 0, considered as dierential
on . the vector-function cn is holomorphic at qi. if we take an expansion of c in the
local coordinate (z  z(qi))1/2 (in general position when the branching point is simple) and
consider its variation we get that

cn = 

dcn
dz

z(qi) + o(1).

therefore, cn has a simple pole at qi. in the similar way we obtain

w = 

dw
dz

z(qi).

equalities (5.20) and (5.21) imply that

resqi = resqi"< c 

n+1lndcn >

at qi we have dln(qi) = 0. therefore, in a way similar to (5.18) we get

resqi = resqi"< c 

n t dc0 > 

wdz

dw # .

(5.20)

(5.21)

(5.22)

(5.23)

due to skew-symmetry of the wedge product we may replace t in (5.23) by (t  w).
then using identities c 
n (w  t ) and (w  t )dc0 = (dt  dw)c0 we obtain

n (t  w) = c 

resqi = resqi < c 

n c0 > wdz = resqi < c 

n c0 > wdz.

note, that the dt does not contribute to the residue, because dt (qi) = 0.

expansions (4.19, 4.20) near the punctures imply that

a sum of (5.19) and (5.26) gives (5.16) because

n +1xs=1

ress xqi

resqi.

our next goal is to prove the following statement.

20

lemma 5.2 the symplectic form given by (5.11) coincides with the canonical symplectic
structure

 =

pn  xn.

(5.28)

n +1xn=0

proof. using the gauge transformation (4.7)

ln = gn+1 lng1

n , cn = gn c, gn =  exn(z)

0

0

exn(z) ! ,

we obtain

< res0 tr(cid:16) c1

 =

1
2

where

n+1(z) ln(z)   cn(z) + c1

n+1ln  fncn  c1

n+1fn  lncn(cid:17) > dz,

(5.29)

fn = gng1

n =  xn(z)

0

0

xn(z) ! .

from (4.32), using the equality

((xn+1 + xn)  (xn+1  xn)) sn + (1,1

n, + 1,2

n,) = sn ((xn+1  xn)  (xn+1 + xn)) ,

which follows from (4.28), we obtain that the rst term in (5.29)

is equal to

j1 = res0 < tr(cid:16) c1

n+1(z) ln(z)   cn(z)(cid:17) > dz

j1 =<

sn

2sn+1

hn+1   ((xn  xn+1) + (xn+1 + xn)) > .

equation (4.34) implies

j1 =<

2hn+1  xn+1

h2
n+1  1



2hn+1  xn

n+1  1   (xn  xn+1) + (xn + xn+1)

(xn  xn+1)  (xn + xn+1)! > .

h2

the second term in (5.29) equals

j2 =< res0 tr(cid:16)c1

n+1ln  fncn(cid:17) > dz =< res0 tr(cid:16)l1

n ln  fn(cid:17) > dz

from denition (5.1) of ln by direct calculations we obtain that

j2 =<

2hn+1  xn

n+1  1   (xn  xn+1) + (xn + xn+1)

(xn  xn+1)  (xn + xn+1)! > .

h2

(5.30)

(5.31)

at last, the third term in (5.29) is equal to

j3 =  < res0 tr(cid:16)c1

n+1fn+1  lncn(cid:17) > dz =< res0 tr(cid:16)(ln)l1

n  fn+1(cid:17) > dz.

again, direct calculations imply

j3 =<

2hn+1  xn+1

h2
n+1  1

> .

(5.32)

equations (5.30,5.31), and (5.32) imply (5.28). lemma is proved.

now we are ready to complete a proof of the theorem. equations (5.16) and (2.14) imply

that

indeed, we have

 = ,  =

n +1xs=1 z s

p+

 ln(n w)dz.

 =

n +1xs=1

 ln w(s)  z(s)  n ln   

n +1xs=1

z(s).

(5.33)

(5.34)

the last term in (5.34) equals zero on the bers + = const of the map (5.5).

the dierential ds = ln(n w)dz is multi-valued on  but, following the arguments
of [16], one can show that its derivatives with respect to ik, k = 1, . . . , n, which can be
considered as coordinates on a space of curves given by (1.6), are holomorphic dierentials.
ds is an odd dierential with respect to permutation of sheets of . therefore, in +1 = in
and the denition of ik implies that


ik

ds = dh

k, k = 1, . . . , n  1,


in

equations (5.7) and (2.6) imply that

ds = dh

n  dh

n +1.

 =

n 1xk=1

(kik) + in ,

and using (5.33) we nally obtain (5.10). theorem is proved.
