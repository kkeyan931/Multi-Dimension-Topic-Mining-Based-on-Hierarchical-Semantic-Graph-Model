abstract

we revise the calculation of the one-loop eective action for scalar and spinor elds coupled

to the dilaton in two dimensions. applying the method of covariant perturbation theory for

the heat kernel we derive the eective action in an explicitly covariant form that produces

both the conformally invariant and the conformally anomalous terms. for scalar elds the

conformally invariant part of the action is nonlocal. the obtained eective action is proved

to be infrared nite. we also compute the one-loop eective action for scalar elds at nite

temperature.

1 introduction

the eective action and conformal anomaly of quantum elds coupled to the dilaton
in two dimensions have been the subject of a number of recent papers. the main
motivation for the study of quantum eld models in 2d dilaton-gravity backgrounds
comes from the fact that such models naturally arise after the spherical (or dimen-
sional) reduction from higher-dimensional eld theories and gravity. for a description
of the spherical reduction procedure leading to dilaton gravity in two dimensions, we
refer to [1, 2].

two dimensional models seem to be easy to quantize, and in some cases they admit
exact solutions at classical and quantum levels. black hole physics is one of the most
interesting applications of such models [1, 3]. seemingly, the two-dimensional results
could provide information about higher-dimensional quantum physics. the question
of the eective action for 2d dilaton gravity and its relation to hawking radiation
is addressed in many papers ([4, 5, 6, 7], to mention a few). for the history and
contemporary state of this problem see a recent review by kummer and vassilevich
[8]. however, the applicability of these two-dimensional considerations to the hawking
eect in four dimensions is hampered by serious problems [6, 9, 10] (some of these
problems are related to the dimensional-reduction anomalies and may be resolved
via their thorough analysis [11]).

we study here only two-dimensional models, so, we are not concerned with prob-
lems related to the dimensional reduction or higher-dimensional quantum physics.
specically, in this paper we focus on the one-loop eective action for quantum mat-
ter elds interacting with the background dilaton and gravity in two dimensions, and
related infrared problems. surprisingly, there is no consensus in the literature even
about this relatively simple problem. we derive the one-loop eective action, which,
in our opinion, corrects and supplements other known results on this subject.

2 heat kernel for scalar elds coupled to the dila-

ton in two dimensions

let us begin with the classical action for the scalar matter eld  coupled to the
background metric g and the background dilaton eld ,

s = 

1

2 z d2x g1/2e2.

(1)

2

we do not specify here the function , which can be an arbitrary smooth function.
following the procedure of [4, 12] we redene eld variables and rewrite the action
(1) in terms of new scalar elds  = e. then the action takes the form

s = 

1

2 z d2x g1/2n    2[  ()()]o.

the one-loop eective action for this model is dened as

w =

1
2

tr ln f (),

where the dierential operator corresponding to the action (2) reads

f () =  +   ()().

(2)

(3)

(4)

the widely accepted technique to compute the eective action is to use the trace
anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor (weyl anomaly), t = 2g(w/g). com-
bined with the proper boundary conditions it provides enough information to de-
rive unambiguously the one-loop eective action in the absence of the dilaton, the
polyakov action [13]. a similar method was applied to the system of quantum scalar
elds coupled to the dilaton [4, 12, 14, 15, 16]. the operator (4) describes a 2d
conformal model, and, in this case, w is also restored by the integration of the con-
formal anomaly. such an eective action is known as the anomaly-induced action.
because this action is completely dened by t, the main subject of calculations and
controversies in the existing literature was the computation of the anomaly itself.
unfortunately, unlike the polyakov action, the anomaly-induced action is incomplete
because it may contain conformally invariant terms that can not be xed by knowl-
edge of the anomaly alone. these missing terms are important, for they lead to a
non-zero (though traceless) energy-momentum tensor. this ambiguity is an artifact
of the method, and its origin is obvious. the integral of the weyl anomaly is, in fact,
the dierence between the eective actions in a physical spacetime and in a reference
one [17]. without a dilaton the reference spacetime is implicitly assumed to be at
with the same topology as the physical 2d manifold. the presence of the dilaton
leads to a nontrivial conformally invariant eective action in the reference spacetime.
as we will show explicitly, this action is generically nonlocal; hence, it can contribute
to the hawking radiation from the 2d dilaton black holes.

in order to obtain the complete eective action we use a method, which is dierent
from the one we just described. our approach to this problem has two important
features: 1) it is manifestly covariant throughout all calculations; 2) it does not make

3

use of the trace anomaly, thus, both anomaly-producing and conformally invariant
terms come from the same calculation.

we begin with the heat kernel for the operator (4) and express the one-loop

eective action as an integral over the proper time s, [18, 19],

w = 

1

2 z 

0

ds
s

trk(s),

(5)

in coordinate representation tr denotes the functional trace, tr k(s) = r ddx tr k(s|x, x)

in arbitrary dimensions d, where tr denotes the matrix trace over any internal de-
grees of freedom that may be present in a eld theory. the heat kernel k(s) is dened
as a solution of the problem

d
ds

k(s|x, y) = f (x) k(s|x, y),

k(0|x, y) = 1(x  y).

(6)

for the computation of the heat kernel we employ the covariant perturbation
theory of barvinsky and vilkovisky [20, 21, 22, 23]. as a basis for our calculations
we use a general expression for the trace of the heat kernel in arbitrary spacetime
dimensions obtained in refs. [23, 24, 25] up to the third order in curvatures,

trk(s) =

1

(4s)d/2 z ddx g1/2n1 + s p + s2

5

xi=1

fi(s2)12(i)

+ s3

29

xi=1

fi(s1,s2,s3)123(i) + o[4]o,

for the generic eld operator

f () = 1 

1
6

r(x) + p (x).

(7)

(8)

here r is the ricci scalar, and p is an arbitrary potential term, which depends on
the background elds and curvatures. in (7) we introduced the collective notation
for background eld strengths (curvatures),  = (r, r, p ), which includes the
commutator curvature,

[,] = r.

(9)

the form factors fi and fi in eq. (7) are analytic functions of the dimensionless
argument s that act on tensor invariants constructed from the eld strengths. it
is assumed that the operator arguments i in the form factors are acting on the
curvatures at the corresponding spacetime points, i = (xi), and after that all
spacetime points are made coincident, x1 = x2 = x3 = x.

4

for straightforward applications of this result, the dierential operator for a eld
model should be of the form (8). it was already shown [23, 24] that the heat kernel (7)
correctly reproduces the polyakov action, where the operator is just f () = . the
operator (4) also belongs to the class of models (8) with the following specications,

tr1 = 1,

p = (cid:16)1

6

r +   ()()(cid:17)1.

(10)

furthermore, the basis of 29 tensor structures in the third order [23, 25] can be
considerably reduced using the identities

r = 0,

r =

1
2

gr.

(11)

it is useful to express the heat kernel (7) in terms of two background eld objects,
the ricci scalar r and the dilaton eld , instead of r and p . integrating by parts
and discarding total derivatives we represent the rst local term of (7) in the form

z d2x g1/2 p (x) = z d2x g1/2 .

(12)

the expression for the trace of the heat kernel for operator (4) reads

with the basic form factors (14) and

f (s1,s2,s3) = z0

d1 d2 d3 (1  1  2  3)

the form factors in (7) and (13) are analytical functions of the proper time, that can
be exhibited, for example, by rewriting the following form factor,

 exp(cid:16)s(231 + 132 + 123)(cid:17).

local coecients of the schwinger-dewitt expansion [18, 19], which is often used
in quantum eld theory, can be easily obtained from the nonlocal expression (7) by
the simple expansion of all form factors in powers of the proper time [24].

3 one-loop eective action for scalar elds coupled

to the dilaton in two dimensions

the trace of the heat kernel is a classical object, which, nevertheless, contains com-
plete information about all quantum averages. for example, the trace anomaly
in two dimensions is completely dened by the rst schwinger-dewitt coecient,
a1(x) = tr p (x) [the potential term gures here in the form (10), rather than in the
integrated form (12)]. this is a local expression, and any derivations of the one-loop
eective action based just on the coecient a1 ignore complex conformally invariant,
nonlocal structures of the heat kernel. such methods work well in the case of pure
2d gravity and give the polyakov eective action, but they fail in the case of dilaton
gravity models. however, these procedures still might be valid for another eld model
[5, 8] discussed in the closing section of this paper.

in two dimensions, even after subtracting the ultraviolet divergences, the result-
ing one-loop renormalized eective action is not generally dened because of bad
behavior of the heat kernel trace in the large proper time limit (infrared divergence)
[21]. however, in our model (2)-(4) we can control the infrared behavior using the
asymptotic behavior of the form factors [24],

f (s) =

and, hence, the proper time integral is convergent at the upper limit.

in order to compute the integral (5) we apply the technique of ref. [24]. let us

kernel satisfy:

(28)

the third-order form factors ni(s|1, 2, 3) may be found in appendix b. as can
be seen from (24), not all of the terms in trk(s) admit the form of a total derivative.
as a result, in contrast to the polyakov action [13, 24], the eective action (5) in two
dimensions depends on the ultraviolet cuto parameter .

for the sake of convenience we split the total renormalized eective action into two
parts, wren = wn+w. wn is a part dened by the total derivative terms of eq. (24)
while w is dened by the rest (including any higher order terms). the calculation
of the nite terms becomes trivial as we perform the proper time integration. using
eqs. (20), (21) again we can check that the form factors fi and ni vanish at the upper
limit, s  . thus,

where n sym
(i = 1, . . . 4) are symmetrized in their arguments, 1, 2, 3, according
to the symmetries of the tensor structures they are acting on. all of the third-order
(3) contributions to the heat kernel trace vanish, leaving the expression

wn =

r + 12r(cid:27) .

(30)

this part coincides with the usual form of the one-loop eective action derived by
the integration of the trace anomaly [2, 4, 12, 14].

8

to treat the remaining terms of the eective action (when the zeroth order term

is already subtracted [27]) we apply the proper time cuto regularization,

w = 

1

dsn1

 + h(s|2)(1)(2)

(31)

where infrared and ultraviolet cuto parameters are introduced correspondingly at
the upper and lower limits of the proper time integral in order to single out terms of
this integral that are apparently divergent. however, the integral as a whole appeared
to be infrared nite and independent of the parameter l, as will be demonstrated in a
moment. as far as ultraviolet divergences are concerned, only the rst, local, term of
integral (31) is divergent when   . then, the key element of our computations
is the integral:

d

e(1)l  1
(1  )

= 

2

 (cid:16) ln(l) + c(cid:17),

(32)

where c is the euler constant. the dependence on the infrared cuto parameter l in
rst two terms of integral (31) cancels, as does the l -dependence in the form factor
(28) of the third term. the resulting expression reads

w =

ln(2/3)
(2  3)

r1(2)(3) + o[4]) .

(33)
it should be emphasized that the nonlocal form factors of eq. (33) can be used for
physical applications only when expressed in terms of the green function, e.g., after
converting them into the mass spectral integrals [21, 22],

equation (36) is one of the main results of this paper. this eective action is covariant
by construction.
it evidently reproduces the conformally anomalous part [4] and
unambiguously xes new conformally invariant terms that were not derived previously
in the literature. it can be seen explicitly from (36) that, with an exception for the
anomalous r term, terms of the rst and third orders in the dilaton eld are absent
from the conformally invariant part of this one-loop eective action. this plausibly
indicates that all higher-order terms are even in powers of the dilaton. this conjecture
can be tested using the higher-order perturbation expansions for the heat kernel in
at space found in refs. [28, 29].

in agreement with ref. [7], we see that the 2 terms of the eective action are
nonlocal, and do not have the local form derived in [5, 8]. we should stress that these
terms are infrared nite. only the ultraviolet regularization parameter  enters the
answer, and not the infrared cuto as was suggested in [7].

the form of the last term in eq. (36) is dierent from the one in ref. [7] because
the covariantization procedure of nonlocal terms used there is incorrect. to check our
result we can perform the opposite operation, namely, to sum the series of the terms
quadratic in the dilaton into a at space object. to do so we take the expression (33)
in a at space assuming that the original metric is related to the at space one g
via a conformal factor: g = e2 g. to return to the original metric we have to
use the equation for the variation of the eective action form factor [26],

into (37) one can see that it becomes nothing but the second term of eq. (33). as
a result, it is possible to rewrite the terms quadratic in the dilaton eld in a at
spacetime form,

2

w =

8 z d2x ((  ) ln(



2 ) + o[4]) .

(39)

when expanded in powers of the curvatures, the eective action (39) again becomes
an innite series.

4 partial summation of the dilaton eective action

in the previous sections we have derived the one-loop eective action as a perturbation
series in powers of the dilaton eld . so far no explicit form of the dilaton eld was
assumed, and we could rewrite this expansion in terms of the potential p (). but
instead of doing a perturbative expansion using the potential as a small parameter,
we perform a partial summation of the eective action and obtain a result, which is
nonperturbative in terms of p . to simplify calculations we work in a at spacetime
in the present and following sections. in other words, we perform all operations only
with the conformal part of wren, eq. (39), and we can restore the whole covariant
result, expressed in terms of r and p , at the end of the derivations. for the sake of
convenience, we keep here the covariant notation  instead of the at-space one  .

let us begin with the equation for the potential p ,

p =   ()().

(40)

we rewrite this equation as a linear dierential equation by substituting the following
ansatz for the dilaton eld [4],

the solution of the resulting equation on ,

 =  ln .

reads

( + p ) = 0,

(43)

in principle, more
where the boundary condition  = 1 at |x|   is assumed.
general solutions containing zero modes, 0 = 0, are allowed, but the requirement
of covariant perturbation theory [21] that all background elds including the dilaton
eld (41) vanish at spacetime innity puts 0 = 1.

the eective action, which is known up to the third order in the dilaton eld, now
can be written in a nonperturbative form by inserting (41) and (43) into eq. (39).
the result reads

1

8 z d2x () ln(

w =

where

(x) =  ln(cid:18)1

p(cid:19) .

11

(44)

(45)

thus, we obtain a partially summed form of the one-loop eective action. this
summation is partial, because not all higher-order terms are included in (44), (45)
but only those containing the form factor ln(/2). such a summation with help
of a new auxiliary scalar eld, which is expressed in a nonlocal way through the
perturbation (curvature) [30], is very similar to the summation of the ricci scalar
terms in the 4d covariant eective action performed in ref. [31].

to reproduce the perturbation series we rst obtain the expansion of ,

(x) = 1

(47)

this series obviously coincides with an iterative solution of eq. (40). the perturbative
expansion of (44) reads

the leading term of this expansion is apparently similar to the expression obtained in
ref. [7] with the reservation of a dierent meaning for the regularization parameter

5 dilaton eective action at nite temperature

an obvious use for the obtained one-loop eective action is its application to the cal-
culation of the stress tensor. so far we have worked in a euclidean spacetime. accord-
ing to rules of covariant perturbation theory, one makes the transition to minkowski
spacetime only after deriving quantum averages and currents from the euclidean ef-
fective action [20]. similarly, in the calculation of the energy-momentum tensor for
quantum elds in a black hole background boundary conditions corresponding to the
unruh, boulware, or hartle-hawking vacua are to be specied after the variation over
the metric. authors of [6, 9] completed this procedure by making the eective action

12

local by introducing auxiliary elds and imposing the proper boundary conditions on
them.

the other way to introduce boundary conditions corresponding to the hartle-
hawking vacuum is to consider the eld system at some xed temperature t = 1/.
this is relatively easy to do, because the killing vector always exists in two di-
mensions, in contrast to higher dimensions [32, 33, 34]. therefore, without losing
generality, we can make a conformal transformation to a at space where the eu-
clidean time is periodic, i.e., the at spacetime has the topology of a cylinder. in our
new at space the anomaly-generating part of the eective action (30) vanishes, so
we deal only with the conformally invariant part (33). this is what one would ex-
pect, because the anomalous part does not depend on temperature. in our treatment
of the nite-temperature eective action for scalar elds coupled to the dilation we
will follow the computational scheme of refs. [33, 34]. for general notions of nite
temperature eld theory we refer to [32], and references on some earlier works can be
found in [34].

let us start with the at-space limit of the trace of the heat kernel (7),

trk(s) =

1

(4s)d/2 z ddx (cid:26)1 + sp + s2 1

2

p f (s)p + o[p 3](cid:27) .

(49)

here we restrict our consideration to terms of the second order, because it gives the
rst nonlocal contribution to the nite-temperature eective action w . using the
form (10) for the potential term we rewrite this heat kernel in terms of the dilaton
eld,

trk(s) =

1

(4s)d/2 z ddx (cid:26)1 + s + s2 1

2

()f (s)() + o[3](cid:27) .

(50)

we are calculating w  in a way similar to the zero temperature case (5),

w  = 

1

2 z 

0

ds

s (cid:16)trk (s)  trk(s)|=0(cid:17) ,

(51)

where we subtract the zeroth-order term of the zero-temperature trk(s) from the
heat kernel at some nite temperature 1/. it is well known [32] that one can express
the heat kernel at nite temperature as an innite sum of the zero temperature heat
kernels at separated points x and x,

k (s|, x;  , x

) =



xn=

13

),
k(s|, x;   + n, x

(52)

where  is the euclidean time and x are the spatial coordinates. then, the two-
dimensional trk  can be found via the heat kernel in one dimension,

trk (s) = 3(cid:16)0, e 
4s(cid:17)

2



(4s)1/2 z d1x tr k (1)(s|x, x),

where we have introduced the jacobi theta function ,

3(a, b) 

n=

xn=

e2naibn2

.

(53)

(54)

the zeroth-order term of the eective action requires special treatment. first
of all, it is removed by the renormalization procedure in the zero temperature qft
[see eq. (51)], which amounts to subtracting the n = 0 term from the sum (52).
straightforward computation of the proper time integral (51) with the subsequent
summation over n gives us a numerical coecient in front of the 1/ term, which
gures in the nal expression (58) below.

the dilaton-dependent part of w can be computed after the poisson re-summation,

(55)

the term k = 0 of a new sum over k corresponds to the high temperature limit
t   ( = 0), and it is ultraviolet nite. the rest of the k-sum corresponds to a
single term n = 0 (t = 0) of the original n-sum, thus, it needs to be regularized. all
of this follows from the fact that ultraviolet counterterms introduced in a eld theory
at zero temperature are sucient for renormalization of the nite temperature eld
theory. here we use the zeta function regularization,

w 

k6=0 =

(56)

where  is a small positive parameter and  is the gamma function.

on the other hand, the sum over k is infrared nite, with an exception for the
k = 0 term. infrared divergences appearing in dierent orders of the perturbation
theory in p are, in fact, articial and disappear in the nal result expressed in terms
of , but we need to introduce an auxiliary mass to treat them at intermediate stages,

w

one can observe that the infrared poles in w

where  is the psi function. the obtained nite temperature eective action is in-
frared nite but depends on the ultraviolet regularization parameter . even though
arguments of the psi functions are imaginary, the combination of s in eq. (58) is
equivalent to the real part of . the thermal form factor found is a smooth function
of the inverse temperature , and its dierent asymptotics can be easily analyzed.

we emphasize that expression (58) is valid for arbitrary temperature, and high and
low temperature asymptotics can be derived from it. the most popular expansion
in thermal eld theory is the high temperature one,   0. we found that this
expansion admits a local form,

(59)

this series has a form similar to high temperature expansions in four dimensions
[32, 34].

the other important limit is, of course, the low temperature asymptotic,

(60)

restoring the eective action to the original two-dimensional spacetime form one can
see that the leading, temperature independent, term of this expansion is just wren at
zero temperature (33).

in curved spacetime the total result will be the sum of the anomalous part of
the eective action (30), and eq. (58) with all at quantities, metric and derivatives,
being expressed in terms of physical (curved spacetime) ones. we are not aware of
similar results in the literature to which one could make any comparisons.

6 discussion

we have calculated the one-loop eective action for scalar elds interacting with
a background dilaton eld in curved spacetime. the main results are eqs. (36)
and (44) for the zero-temperature case and eq. (58) for the nite-temperature one.
strictly speaking, these results are obtained for a generic dilaton eld as long as the
corresponding potential p has the form (10), and decreases suciently rapidly at
innity. these results are applicable to arbitrary two-dimensional spacetimes with
the topology of either a disk or a cylinder, because in two dimensions there is always
a killing vector, and using nonsingular conformal transformations the problem can
be reduced to one for a at spacetime with the corresponding topology.

the dierence between our approach and a similar attempt to use perturbation
theory made in the interesting paper [7] is that we are able to control the infrared
divergences that appear in two-dimensional calculations. we computed the one-loop
eective action as an expansion in powers of the dilaton eld rather than in the
potential term of a dierential operator, and proved the infrared niteness of the
eective action order by order. the resulting covariant nonlocal eective action does
not depend on the infrared cuto, and is proved to be valid up to the third order
in the spacetime curvature and the dilaton. for one particular eld model in a two-
dimensional at spacetime infrared niteness of the one-loop two-point functions was
demonstrated in ref. [35]. lombardo, mazzitelli and russo [7] found, using results of
ref. [35], the nonlocal form factor entering the conformally invariant part of the 2d
eective action. unfortunately, their generalization of this result to curved spacetime
(covariantization) was not correct. the correct form of the covariantization procedure
makes use of eq. (37). by applying it to the terms quadratic in the dilaton we summed
them up into a single at-space term (39). then, the dilaton eld could be expressed
in terms of the potential term, eq. (44), and, if necessary, be expanded in powers of
the potential and/or curvatures.

eq. (36) demonstrates that the eective action for scalars interacting with the dila-
ton does not admit the exact form proposed by kummer and vassilevich in refs. [5, 8],
but contains additional conformally invariant terms that are nonlocal. here we would
like to explain the origin of this discrepancy. in order to calculate the one-loop eec-
tive action corresponding to the bosonic operator (4) they substituted the fermionic
representation of the determinant of the operator

f () = g(dd + 1),

(61)

16

in a at spacetime for an original bosonic representation. note that we work in the
euclidean signature and the derivative d is dened (for the case  =  =  in the
notation of [5]) as

d =   5

,

(62)

here 5 belongs to the algebra of gamma matrices and has the property (5)2 = 1.
this is an absolutely legitimate procedure as long as one deals with formal denitions
of the operator determinants in at spacetime (3). but the renormalization procedure
generically breaks the identity of these two representations, hence, the corresponding
renormalized eective actions do not coincide. to check this fact by an explicit
calculation, one can note that the operator (61) also belongs to the class of operators
of the type (8). therefore, one can directly apply the covariant perturbation theory
to this model. let us write down the corresponding potential term,

and the commutator curvature,

p = 1  ,

r = 5(

  

).

(63)

(64)

we performed the computation of the one-loop eective action along the lines of
the calculational scheme of sections 2 and 3 and using the tables of form factors of
ref [23]. we found that the terms of third order in , which in this case is equivalent
to order 3, vanishes, and the 2 terms have no infrared singularity. the nal answer
for the eective action corresponding to the operator (61) is local and nite:

wren = 

1

8 z d2x    + o[4].

(65)

indeed, this expression is in good agreement with eq. 42 of ref. [5] (the opposite
sign is attributed to the euclidean spacetime signature). however, as one can see, it
is completely dierent from the eective action for the original bosonic model found
in section 3 above. technically, this stems from the fact that in order to remove
the ultraviolet divergences one should subtract the rst two terms of the schwinger-
dewitt expansion of the heat kernels. but the schwinger-dewitt coecients for the
operators in question are absolutely dierent, because their heat kernels are dierent.
nevertheless, the remarkable result of ref. [5] is the exact expression for the eective
action for the spinor model (61). this two-dimensional one-loop eective action is
local, infrared nite, and does not depend on a regularization parameter. in principle,
we could start with a covariant version of the dierential operator (61) and derive

17

the covariant eective action, but it not necessary because all conformally invariant
terms in that eective action can be obtained from eq. (65) by covariantization, while
the anomalous part is proved to be exact [5].

a few remarks are in order about the applicability of the perturbative expansion
to physically interesting cases. the covariant perturbation theory works well when
derivatives of the background elds are much bigger than powers of these elds [21],

 >> 2.

(66)

since the anomalous part (30) is exact, we are concerned only about the conformal
terms, (33) or (39). for instance, if one wants to use the results above to study black
hole physics and consider the 2d dilaton gravity inspired by the spherical reduction
from four dimensions, then the dilaton eld is dened as  =  ln r (where 4r2 is the
area of a surface of the constant radius r). at innity the 2d schwarzschild metric is
asymptotically at, and the 2d curvature and potential obviously satisfy the condition
(66). as for the vicinity of the horizon, note that w in eq. (39) is expressed in terms
of the at spacetime operator  . this means that all quantities in eq. (66) should
also be dened in the at metric g. one can check that the condition  p >> p 2
(in the tortoise coordinates) is also satised near the horizon. this means that our
results should be valid both at innity and at the horizon of the 2d dilaton black
hole.

kummer and vassilevich [2, 5, 8] considered the case of a more general dierential
operator, with the dilaton coupling being dened in terms of two arbitrary functions
of the dilaton, () and (). the results of this paper are obtained for the simplest
case () = () = . strong reasons to study more general models are discussed in
ref. [8]; here, we just would like to note that such nontrivial dilaton couplings can
be incorporated into our computational method. this is possible to do, because such
models correspond to the minimal second-order operator when expressed in terms of
new redened metric and covariant derivative [2], but we leave this generalization for
some other publication.

in conclusion, we would like to make some general comments on the validity of
the anomaly-induced eective actions. such eective actions are very attractive,
because they are relatively easy to derive, and they have rather simple structures.
however, as was shown above, the anomaly-induced eective actions are incomplete
even for simple two-dimensional eld models. this is also true for four dimensions,
and an interesting recent work [36] would be a good illustration. the authors applied
the nonlocal eective action obtained by integration of the four-dimensional trace

18

anomaly (the generalized riegert action) to the study of the hawking radiation.
indeed, this action is nonlocal, therefore, it captures some essential features of the
energy-momentum tensor in curved spacetime. nevertheless, as correctly noted in
[36], further applications of the riegert action encounter serious obstacles, because
it is ill-dened at innity [37]. the four-dimensional nonlocal eective action of
barvinsky and vilkovisky [21, 23] is the only known action with the right properties
[37]. there are many ways to split this eective action into anomalous and conformal
parts [38], and only one of them gives the riegert action. in order to obtain physically
consistent results we should always use the entire eective action, not just its anomaly-
generating part.
