separated along x6 direction distance l. one introduces n1 parallel d- fourbranes (x1, x2, x3, x6) plane, suspended two ns-vebranes. worldvolume theory n1 parallel d-fourbrane described open string pertur- bation theory low energy ve-dimensional u(n1) gauge theory sixteen 3 supersymmetries (the equivalent n = 4 = 4). overall u(1) factor describes centre mass motion d-fourbranes trivial ignore it. consider presence ns-vebranes. innitely heavy compared d-fourbranes (which nite extent along x6). therefore provide low energy degrees freedom. instead cause low energy d-fourbrane theory reduced four dimensions project half supersymmetry. thus eective theory conguration four-dimensional n = 2 su(n1) yang-mills theory. go strong coupling limit string theory given eleven-dimensional m-theory. one must introduce extra dimension x10 compactied circle radius r. ns-vebranes simply m-vebranes d- fourbranes become m-vebranes wrapped around x10 dimension. thus arrive m-theory conguration (2). indeed whole conguration viewed single m-vebrane wrapped manifold sw . shown {$9703166$} sw precisely known seiberg-witten elliptic curve appearing complete low energy eective action n = 2 su(n1) yang-mills theory {$9407087$} (see also {$9604034$} similar role m- vebrane). addition studying dynamics m-vebrane one determine low energy eective action including innite number instanton corrections . thus classical dynamics m-vebrane capable predicting exact coecients four-dimensional supersymmetric yang-mills theory. paper wish study similar way type iia brane conguration (3) obtained including n2 additional d-fourbranes (1) (x1, x4, x5, x6) plane. thus intersection two d-fourbranes three-dimensional space. however ns-vebranes insure x6 dimension nite hence low energy theory two-dimensional. addition extra d-fourbranes project another half supersymmetries leaving four supercharges. see consider large string coupling constant limit conguration (3) lifted m-theory conguration (4). three m-vebranes (4) preserve supersymmetries 012345 = , 0123610 = , 0145610 = . (5) 4 follows remaining four supersymmetries chiral 01 = , (6) hence two-dimensional low energy theory (4, 0) supersymmetry. consider eld theory living d-brane intersection. weak coupling obtained standard d-brane techniques given {$9703166$}. mentioned intersecting d-fourbranes reduce ve-dimensional eld theory three dimensions. note also trivial so(3) = su(2) symmetry x7, x8, x9 dimensions. leads su(2) r-symmetry group. add ns-vebranes must dimensionally reduce system two dimensions. counting massless states gives following modes terms two-dimensional n = (4, 4) super-multiplets. open strings begin end d-fourbranes parallel (x1, x2, x3, x6) obtain vector-multiplet gauge group su(n1) (here = 0, 1 = 1, 2) a, a, a, = x 4 + ix 5 = a2 + ia3. also hyper-multiplet x 7, x 8, x 9, a6, (7)

dimensions. two multiplets insensitive hence preserve full (8, 8) supersymmetry (i.e. single d- fourbrane). addition hyper-multiplet 1, 2, 3, 4, (11) coming open strings stretching two types d-fourbrane {$9703166$}. states transform fundamental representation u(n1) u(n2). again, since u(1) u(1) factor group trivial, interacting part hyper-multiplet fundamental representation su(n1) su(n2). states mediate interaction two factors gauge group (i.e. interactions two types d-fourbranes) break supersymmetry (4, 4). ns-vebranes dimensionally reduce three-dimensional intersection two dimensions. pointed {$9611230$} also impose boundary conditions d-fourbranes meet ns-vebranes eliminate zero modes break additional supersymmetries. following argument let us consider adjoint hyper-multiplets. elds represent uctuations d-fourbranes directions transverse ns-vebranes and, since d-fourbranes must end ns-vebrane, must impose dirichlet boundary conditions scalar elds x 7, x 8, x 9 vanish x6 = 0, l. implies massive modes (with massive order string scale) hence appear low energy yang-mills theory. argument applies separately type d-fourbrane, construction {$9703166$}, follows (4, 4) superpartners a6, b6, a, b massive too. hand vector multiplets represent uctuations d-fourbranes within ns-vebranes need vanish x6 = 0, l. instead simply impose neumann boundary conditions leave zero modes elds (4, 4) multiplet. boundary conditions imposed bi-fundamental hyper multiplet dicult analysis since straightforward geometrical interpretation. end formal argument constructed reproduces mass- less modes adjoint multiplets also shows two lowest helicity zero 6 modes bi-fundamental hyper multiplet remain singlets supersymme- try , i.e. two helicity 1 modes (4, 4) vector multiplet (a, a, (4, 4) vector multiplet (b, b, fermions 2 fermions. summarise, surviving two-dimensional zero a, a) gauge group su(n1), second b, b) gauge group su(n2) two right-handed fundamental su(n1) su(n2). right-handed fermions singlets spacetime supersymmetry leaving (4, 0) supersymmetry two- dimensional intersection. note vector multiplet elds carry momentum intersection (i.e. x2, x3, x4, x5 directions), although bi-fundamental fermions propagate along x0, x1. without bi-fundamental fermions two gauge groups interact equally viewed single four-dimensional n = 2 su(n1) su(n2) gauge theory. therefore resulting eective dynamics obtain accurately describe one-dimensional defect four-dimensional n = 2 su(n1) su(n2) gauge theory. however, since interactions two dierent gauge groups propagate two dimensions, eective dynamics obtain contain full description interacting (4, 0) su(n1) su(n2) two-dimensional gauge theory. let us consider rst theory rst d-fourbrane (x1, x2, x3, x6) plane. ns-vebranes cause x6 dimension compact length l. therefore four-dimensional yang-mills coupling constant gy given ratio g2 = gs/l gs = r3/2 string coupling constant {$9703166$}. follows may go large distance, small curvature limit r, l keeping couplings xed. limit m- theory well described eleven-dimensional supergravity. thus eective description obtain m-theory accurate value yang-mills coupling constant. fact see that, case n = 2 theories, parameter r appear low energy dynamics, therefore insensitive extra dimension. another important restriction low energy terms holomorphic. one may therefore expect kind non-renormalisation theorem ensures correct terms yang-mills theory. thus conjecture basis type iia/m-theory duality arrive exact quantum low energy eective action. 7 3

(13) want consider conguration semi-innite d-fourbranes coming two ns-vebranes. ensure must set c constants, neither zero innite (corresponding = ) nite value z w. without loss generality leads = 1 c = . rescaling b also set = 1. obtain n1 d-fourbranes (x1, w, x6) plane n2 d-fourbranes (x1, z, x6) plane must chose b polynomial degree n1 8 z degree n2 w. general form b written b(z, w) = zn1wn2 p(w)zn1 q(z)wn2 zn11wn21 r1(w)zn11 r2(z)wn21 +r(z, w) . (14) constants, p r1 polynomials degree n2 1 n2 2 w respectively, q r2 polynomials degree n1 1 n1 2 z respectively r(z, w) polynomial degree n1 2 z n2 2 w. set = 1 rescaling z w. leaves (n1 + 1)(n2 + 1) 1 coecients b determine. end imagine xed. gives us surface z, w plane representing two types intersecting d-fourbranes. large z w xed surface takes form z(wn2 p(w)) (qn11wn2 + bwn21 + r1(w)) = 0 , (15) qn11 leading coecient q(z) ignored lower order terms. describe intersecting brane conguration require large z go xed value w, representing d-fourbrane (x1, z, x6) plane. addition symmetry z z . requires terms (15) vanish separately. particular must zero wn2 p(w) write wn2 p(w) = n2 (w wi) , yi=1 (16) interpret wi locations n2 d-fourbranes (x1, z, x6) plane. also shift w coordinate centre mass frozen w = 0, thereby setting pi wi = 0. means p(w) fact degree n2 2. similarly, examining large w limit, write zn1 q(z) = n1 (z zi) , yi=1 (17) interpret zi locations n1 d-fourbranes (x1, w, x6) plane. shift z coordinate set centre mass z = 0. means pi zi = 0 q(z) degree n1 2. 9 also follows (15) polynomial (recall qn11 = 0) wn21 + r1(w) , (18) n2 roots precisely points wi. polynomial degree n2 1 therefore n2 roots identically zero. hence must = r1(w) = 0. similarly large w analysis nd r2(z) = 0. thus b written b(z, w) = zn1wn2 p(w)zn1 q(z)wn2 + r(z, w) , (19) p(w) degree n2 2 q(z) degree n1 2. thus nd (n1 1) + (n2 1) moduli coming polynomials p q also (n1 1)(n2 1) moduli polynomial r write form r(z, w) = n11 n21 xi=1 xi=1 uiizi1wi1 . (20) seen identify moduli zi wi positions d-fourbranes. however moduli r determine subtle features hypersurface hard see large z, w limit clearly identify distinct d-fourbranes. follows m-theory/type iia duality associate d-brane yang-mills theory complex hyper-surface c3 given y2 = "zn1 yi (w wi) + wn2yi (z zi) zn1wn2 +xii uiizi1wi1#2 1 , (21) = b. clearly w (z) xed constant surface reduces seiberg-witten curve n = 2 su(n1) (su(n2)) gauge theory trivial rescaling. helpful re-derive surface considering features two four-dimensional su(n) gauge theories. point view want construct complex surface form y2 = b2 1 , (22) b polynomial degree n1 z n2 w. furthermore require coecients b constructed scalar gauge invariant operators four- dimensional yang-mills theories. easy see groups su(n1) su(n2) 10 independent operators (i = 1, ..., n1 1 , = 1, ..., n2 1) zi = tr(an1+1i) , wi = tr(bn2+1i uii = tr(an1+1ibn2+1i ) , ) .

(27) however coecients sub-leading terms cn11,l ck,n21 weights (1, n2 l) (n1 k, 1) respectively. since gauge invariant operators dimensions must set cn11,l = ck,n21 = 0. thus nd b = zn1wn2 +xi zizi1wn2 +xi wizn1wi1 +xii uiizi1wi1 .
