abstract

a theorem of dierential geometry is employed to locally embed a wide class of super-
string backgrounds that admit a covariantly constant null killing vector eld in eleven
dimensional, ricciat spaces.
included in this class are exact type iib superstring
backgrounds with nontrivial ramondramond elds and a class of supersymmetric
string waves. the embedding spaces represent exact solutions to elevendimensional,
vacuum einstein gravity. a solution of elevendimensional supergravity is also embed-
ded in a twelvedimensional, ricciat space.

embedding theorems of dierential geometry are important from both a mathematical

and physical point of view. they relate higher and lowerdimensional theories of gravity

and give rise to classication schemes for dierent spacetimes [1]. they can also lead

to new solutions of einsteins eld equations [2]. a well known theorem states that any

analytic, ndimensional riemannian manifold can be locally and isometrically embedded in
a pseudoeuclidean space of dimension n  n  n(n + 1)/2 [3]. it is also known that the
pseudoeuclidean space must have dimension n  n + 2 if the embedded space is ricciat
[4].

on the other hand, there is a theorem due to campbell that states that any analytic,

ndimensional riemannian manifold can be locally embedded in a ricciat, (n + 1)

dimensional, riemannian space, where the extra dimension may be either spacelike or

timelike [5, 6, 7]. since the embedding space is ricciat, it represents an exact solution

to the vacuum, einstein eld equations in (n + 1) dimensions. one interesting application

of this theorem, therefore, is to generate new solutions to vacuum general relativity by

considering the embedding of lowerdimensional solutions.

the embedding of fourdimensional electromagnetic and gravitational plane waves in

ve dimensions was recently established by application of campbells theorem [8]. the

purpose of the present paper is to employ the theorem to embed exact tendimensional

superstring backgrounds in elevendimensional einstein gravity. it is widely thought that

superstring theory represents a consistent quantum theory of gravity and the study of

classical solutions to the string equations of motion that are exact to all orders in the

inverse string tension, , is therefore important.

we consider spacetimes that admit a covariantly constant null killing vector eld. the

most general, ndimensional spacetime admitting such a eld is the brinkmann metric [9]1:

ds2 = 2dudv + a(u, xi)dxdu  gij(u, xi)dxidxj,

(1)

where the killing vector satises l; = 0 and ll = 0 and the lightcone coordinates
{u, v} are dened by l  u and lv = 1, respectively. the vector function, a,

1greek indices vary from  = (0, 1, . . . , n  1), lower case latin indices run from i = (2, 3, . . . , n  1)
and upper case latin indices take values in the range a = (0, 1, . . . , n). the signature of spacetime is
(+, , , . . .), a semicolon denotes covariant dierentiation and  denotes partial dierentiation with respect
to x.

satises la = 0 and has arbitrary dependence on u and xi. the function gij(u, xi) is

symmetric and positive denite. when the functional forms of the metric components satisfy

appropriate conditions, eq. (1) describes a wide class of exact superstring backgrounds

[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. this includes generalized string plane waves [11, 12] and

the f  and kmodels [13, 14]. (for a recent review of the dierent types of known exact

solutions see, e.g., ref. [16]).

we begin by briey reviewing campbells theorem and proceed to establish the em-

bedding of brinkmann spacetimes. we then apply the embedding procedure directly to

exact superstring backgrounds. in particular, an embedding for a general class of type iib

backgrounds with nontrivial ramond-ramond (rr) elds is found. similar embeddings

are also determined for supersymmetric string waves and solutions to elevendimensional

supergravity.

in general an analytic, ndimensional riemannian manifold with metric (n)g(x) and
line element (n)ds2 = (n)g(x)dxdx may be locally embedded in a (n + 1)dimensional

manifold with a line element

(n+1)ds2 = g(x, )dxdx + 2(x, )d2,

 = 1,

(2)

if the metric coecients g = g(x, ) and  = (x, ) satisfy certain restrictions.

the problem of embedding the ndimensional manifold in (n + 1) dimensions is reduced

to determining the appropriate functional forms for these components. this is achieved by

introducing the set of functions  = (x, ) that satisfy the conditions

 = 

; = 
  2 = (n)r
on an arbitrary hypersurface  = 0 = constant, where





  (n)g,

  (n)g ,

(n)r  (n)r

(n)g

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

and (n)r is the ricci curvature tensor of the manifold calculated from (n)g. we also

require that g and  satisfy the coupled, partial dierential equations

g

(7)






= (cid:16)(n)r

 + 

(cid:17) + g;

(8)

and, moreover, that the components g reduce to the ndimensional metric on the hyper-

surface  = 0, i.e., that

g(x, 0) = (n)g(x).

(9)

it can then be shown that eqs. (3)(8) correspond to the (n + 1)dimensional eld

equations of vacuum einstein gravity,

(n+1)rab(x, 0) = 0,

(10)

when eqs. (7) and (8) are evaluated on the  = 0 hypersurface [7, 18]. however, if eqs.

(7) and (8) are valid in general, it can also be shown that eqs. (3)(5) are satised for all

 in the neighbourhood of 0 [5]. thus, the ricci tensor of the (n + 1)dimensional space

vanishes for all  in the neighbourhood of 0, and since 0 is arbitrary, this implies that
the local embedding of the ndimensional metric (n)g in a (n + 1)dimensional, ricciat

space is given by eq. (2). thus, the embedding is established by solving the set of equations

(3)(9).

we assume that n = 10 and that the vector and tensor functions, a(u, xi) and gij(u, xi),

in eq. (1) are given by

au(u, xi) 

1
2

k(u, xi) =

1
2

k0(u, xi) +

1
2

kij(u)xixj

av  0,

ai(u, xj)  

1
2

mij(u)xj

and

gij(u)  f (u)ij,

(11)

(12)

respectively, where ij denotes the eightdimensional kronecker delta and mij(u)  iaj 
jai represents an eective eld strength of the couplings ai. the quantities mij, kij and

f are arbitrary functions of u only. the antisymmetric nature of mij implies that a1 is
independent of x1, etc. the function k0 is an arbitrary solution to the eightdimensional
laplace equation, k0 = 0, where the laplacian   ijij is taken over the eight
transverse directions. the only nonzero components of the riemann tensor are (10)ruiuj

3

and it follows that the one nontrivial component of the ricci tensor is

(10)ruu = 4f 12

uf + 2f 2(uf )2 +

f 1k +

f 2m 2,

(13)

where m 2  mijmabiajb. moreover, since (10)guu = 0, the ricci scalar curvature of the
spacetime (1) vanishes, (10)r = 0.

given the ansatz (11) and (12), we now establish the local embedding of the general

class of spacetimes (1) in elevendimensional, vacuum einstein gravity. the vanishing of

the ricci curvature scalar of the tendimensional metric implies that  = 0 is a consistent

solution to eqs. (3)(5). eq. (7) then implies that g/ = 0. thus, the components g

of the elevendimensional embedding metric are independent of  and eq. (9) is satised

by choosing g(x) = (10)g(x). the embedding is therefore completed once eq. (8) has

been solved and this equation represents the set of dierential equations

(10)g;  (10)r

 = 0.

(14)

it is interesting that eq. (14) is independent of , i.e., on whether the eleventh dimension

is spacelike or timelike.

all the components of (10)r

 vanish apart from (10)rv

u = (10)ruu. the form of k(u, xi)

in eq. (11) is such that (10)rv

u is a function of the lightcone coordinate u only. this implies

that it is consistent to assume that  = (u). it then follows that all the components of

eq. (14) are trivially satised unless (, ) = (v, u). in this later case, eq. (14) simplies

to the secondorder, ordinary dierential equation

" d2
du2  (10)ruu(u)# (u) = 0.

(15)

thus, the embedding of the class of tendimensional spacetimes (1), (11) and (12) is given

by

(11)ds2 = 2dudv 

1
2

mij(u)xjdudxi +

1
2

k(u, xi)du2  f (u)ijdxidxj + 2(u)d2,

(16)

where  = (u) solves eq. (15). it may be veried by direct calculation of the eleven

dimensional ricci curvature tensor that the manifold with metric (16) is indeed ricciat

when eq. (15) is satised. we emphasize that the embedding is valid for arbitrary functions

4

{kij(u), mij (u), f (u)}. the function k0(u, xi) is also arbitrary, subject to the condition
k0 = 0.

we now apply these results to the type ii superstring theories. the zeroslope limit of

the type iia (iib) superstring is n = 2, n = 10 nonchiral (chiral) supergravity [19, 20].

the action for the neveuschwarz/neveuschwarz (nsns) sector of these theories in the

string frame is [21]

s = z d10xq|(10)g|e(cid:20)(10)r + ()2 

1

3(cid:16)h (1)(cid:17)2(cid:21) ,

(17)

where the graviton, (10)g , dilaton, , and antisymmetric twoform potential, b(1)
 , are
  [b(1)
the massless excitations. the eld strength of the twoform is given by h (1)
and (10)g  det(10)g . the background eld equations derived from action (17) correspond
to the conditions for the oneloop functions of the massless excitations to vanish. these

]

may be solved by the ansatz [15, 16]

b(1)

 = 3b(1)

[ l],

b(1)

v = 0,

b(1)

i

(u, xj) = 

1
2

nij(u)xj ,

 = (u)

(18)

when the metric is given by eqs. (1), (11) and (12) with f (u) = 1. the eld strength
nij(u)  ibj  jbi is a function of u only. the uucomponent of the graviton 
function then takes the form

k +

1
4

m 2  n 2 + 42

u = 0,

(19)

where n 2  nijnabaibj and this may be solved by choosing an appropriate functional
form for trkij(u). all other components of the functions vanish identically. we refer

to the class of superstring backgrounds that satisfy eqs. (1), (11), (12), (18) and (19) as

the nsns backgrounds. a geometrical argument may be employed to show that these

backgrounds are exact to all orders in the inverse string tension [12, 17]. the existence of

the covariantly constant null killing vector eld implies that the riemann curvature tensor
is orthogonal to l. the same property is exhibited by h (1)

 and the derivatives of the
dilaton eld. this implies that all higherorder terms in the equations of motion vanish

identically.

we conclude immediately, therefore, that the embedding of these exact nsns back-

grounds in elevendimensional, ricciat manifolds is given by eqs. (15) and (16) and, in

5

general, substitution of eq. (19) into eq. (13) implies that

(10)ruu(u) =

1
4

n 2(u)  2

u.

as a specic example, we consider the case:

n (u)  constant,

(u) = a0 + a1u + a2u2/2,

(20)

(21)

where {ai} are arbitrary constants. this implies that (10)ruu is itself a constant and the
general solution to eq. (15) is therefore given by

(u) = a exp(cid:20)q(10)ruuu(cid:21) + b exp(cid:20)q(10)ruuu(cid:21) ,

(22)

where a and b are arbitrary constants. we emphasize that this embedding is valid for

arbitrary functions mij(u). in principle, a large class of nontrivial embeddings could be
analytically calculated in this fashion for dierent functional forms of (10)ruu.

the global sl(2, r) symmetry [22, 23] of the tendimensional type iib superstring has

recently been employed to generate new, exact type iib backgrounds with nontrivial rr

elds from the above nsns backgrounds [17]. these backgrounds are interesting because

it is dicult to perturbatively calculate higherorder terms in the type iib theory due

to the specic coupling of the rr sector [24]. this sector consists of a pseudoscalar
axion eld, , a twoform potential, b(2)
 , and a fourform potential, d [19, 21]. the
complex scalar eld    + ie/2 parametrizes the coset sl(2, r)/u(1) and transforms to
 = (a + b)/(c + d) under a global sl(2, r) transformation, where ad  bc = 1. the ns
ns and rr twoforms transform as a doublet, b(i)
 represents

 , where b(i)

a twocomponent vector and

 = (cid:16)t(cid:17)1

b(i)

    a b
c d !

(23)

is an sl(2, r) matrix. the fourform transforms as a singlet, d = d, and the

metric transforms to

(10)g = exph(   )/4i (10)g .

(24)

the nsns backgrounds represent solutions to the type iib string equations of motion

with  = b(2)

 = d = 0. this implies that  = ie/2 and applying a general sl(2, r)

6

transformation to these backgrounds generates a new type iib background [17]:

(10)ds2

iib = f (u)(cid:20)2dudv +

1
2

kdu2 + aidxidu  ijdxidxj(cid:21) ,

where

f (u)  hd2 + c2e(u)i1/2

.

this transformation generates nontrivial  and b(2)

 elds. redening the null variable

u  r u duf (u) and relabelling it as u then implies that the metric (25) takes the form

(10)ds2

iib = 2dudv +

k(u, xi)du2 + ai(u, xi)dxidu  f (u)ijdxidxj,

1
2

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

where

k  f 1k.

it is important that k is a quadratic function of the transverse coordinates xi, because

in this case it can be shown that the type iib backgrounds (27) are exact to all orders in

 [17]. furthermore, the metric (27) is precisely of the form given in eq. (1), where the
metric components satisfy eqs. (11) and (12) and k is identied with k. thus, the only

nonvanishing component of the riccitensor of the spacetime (27) is (10)ruu = (10)rv

u

and substitution of eqs. (19) and (28) into eq. (13) implies that

(10)ruu(u) = 4f 12

uf + 2f 2(uf )2 +

1
4

f 2(cid:16)n 2  42

u(cid:17) .

(29)

since this component is a function of u only, we may conclude that an embedding in an

elevendimensional, ricciat space of the general class of type iib backgrounds (27) with

excited rr elds is given by eqs. (15) and (16).

it is interesting to consider the background generated by the specic sl(2, r) transfor-
mation where a = d = 0 and c = b = 1. since the rr axion is initially trivial ( = 0),
this transformation changes the sign of the dilaton eld,  = , and inverts the string
coupling, g2
it therefore maps the stronglycoupled regime of the

s = e.

s  e  = g2

theory onto the weaklycoupled regime, and viceversa. it also directly interchanges the

nsns and rr twoforms and leaves  = 0. since the rr twoform is initially zero, the

new background has a trivial nsns twoform and nontrivial rr twoform.

7

substituting eq. (26) into eq. (29) then implies that

(10)ruu = 

1
2

(u)2 + 22

u +  n 2

4  2

u! e

(30)

and eq. (15) can now be solved exactly if eq. (21) is satised and the dilaton is a linear

function of u (a2 = 0). if we further assume for simplicity that a0 = 0, substitution of eq.

(30) into eq. (15) implies that

(31)

where z  eu. modulo a constant of proportionality, the general solution to eq. (31) is
given by

 = zp(cid:16)n ea1u/2/a1(cid:17) ,

(32)

where zp represents a linear combination of modied bessel functions of the rst and

second kind of order p = 2i.
identifying z with a modied function of the second
kind, for example, implies that  oscillates in the asymptotic limit u   and becomes
exponentially damped when u  + [25]. this diers from the purely oscillatory or
exponential behaviour of eq. (22) for the nsns background.

the rr elds  and b(2)

 do not have an elevendimensional supergravity origin. how-

ever, campbells theorem implies that they may have a geometrical origin in the sense that

all matter elds can in principle be geometrized in terms of higher dimensions. this is closely

related to wessons interpretation of kaluzaklein gravity [26, 27]. in this picture, it can be

shown that vedimensional, vacuum einstein gravity gives rise to fourdimensional gravity

with a general energymomentum tensor if one relaxes the condition that physical quantities

be independent of the extra dimension, as was assumed in the original kaluzaklein the-

ory. thus, derivatives with respect to the fth coordinate are included and fourdimensional

matter may be viewed as a manifestation of empty vedimensional geometry. in eect,

the geometry induces the matter. the extension of this interpretation to arbitrary dimen-

sions has been considered in ref. [28]. it would be interesting to consider the relationship

8

between the rr elds and elevendimensional geometry further in this context, although

this is beyond the scope of the present paper.

to conclude, we consider the class of nsns backgrounds:

(10)ds2

ssw = 2dudv + au(xi)du2 + ai(xi)dxidu  ijdxidxj,

(33)

where the dilaton is xed ( = 0), the vector function a is independent of u and v and the
chiral constraint ai = 2b(1)
dependent terms in the graviton function (19) cancel and this equation reduces to au =

is imposed. this latter constraint implies that the vector

i

0. the background (33) may be embedded in the type iia and type iib superstring theories

[21]. in the zeroslope limit, it corresponds to a supersymmetric string wave that admits

eight constant killing spinors and has precisely onehalf of the spacetime supersymmetries

unbroken [15]. thus, the embeddings that we have considered in this paper apply to this

class of supersymmetric string waves. indeed, since m 2 = 4n 2, it follows from eq. (13)

that (10)ruu = n 2/4 = constant and the embedding metric is therefore given by

(11)ds2

embed = (10)ds2

ssw  2d2,

(34)

where  is determined by eq. (22).

the dimensional reduction of n = 1, n = 11 supergravity on a circle results in type iia

supergravity [21]. this feature has recently been employed to generate a new solution to

the eld equations of elevendimensional supergravity by lifting the tendimensional type

iia solution (33) to eleven dimensions [21]. the new solution generated in this fashion is

(11)ds2

m = (10)ds2

ssw  dy2,

(35)

where y represents the coordinate of the eleventh dimension. the threeform antisymmet-

ric potential is determined by the components ai(xi). eq. (35) generalizes the ppwave

solution found by hull [29]. since it admits a covariantly constant null killing vector eld,

we may consider its embedding in a twelvedimensional, ricciat space along the lines

discussed above. in particular, the only nontrivial component of the riccitensor (11)r


u = (10)ruu = constant, where (10)ruu is calculated from the metric (33). this

is (11)rv

implies that we may immediately write down the embedding of the metric (35) in a twelve

dimensional, ricciat space:

(12)ds2 = (10)ds2

ssw  dy2  2d2,

(36)

9

where  is again given by eq. (22).

an important consequence of campbells theorem is that once the embedding of a

ndimensional manifold in a (n + 1)dimensional, ricciat space has been established,

the procedure may be repeated indenitely to embed the spacetime in ricciat spaces
of dimension d  n + 2. hence, the type iia supersymmetric string wave (33) may be
embedded in twelvedimensional einstein gravity by embedding the elevendimensional

manifold (34). since this space is itself ricciat, eqs.

(3)(8) are solved by  =

(12)ds2 = (11)ds2

0 and  = 1. this implies that the twelvedimensional embedding metric is given by
embed  dw2, where w represents the coordinate of the twelfth dimension.
however, this is formally identical to the metric (36) if the extra dimensions are identied

in an appropriate fashion. we remark that the twelfth dimension may be either space

like or timelike in both cases. thus, the tendimensional type iia supersymmetric string

wave background and the solution (35) to elevendimensional supergravity may be locally

embedded in the same twelvedimensional, ricciat space.

in conclusion, therefore, we have employed campbells theorem to establish the local

embedding of a general class of exact, tendimensional superstring backgrounds in eleven

dimensional, ricciat spaces. the embedded backgrounds admit a covariantly constant

null killing vector eld and the embedding spaces represent exact solutions of eleven

dimensional, vacuum einstein gravity. this is interesting because elevendimensional gen-

eral relativity may be directly related at a certain level to tendimensional superstring

theory. there has been widespread interest recently in the possibility that the ve separate

superstring theories are related by discrete duality symmetries at a nonperturbative level

[21, 22, 23, 30, 31, 32]. this has motivated the conjecture that they arise from a more fun-

damental quantum theory (mtheory) [32, 33]. although the precise form of such a theory

is at present unknown, its lowenergy eective action is elevendimensional supergravity

with a vacuum limit given by the einsteinhilbert action [34].

in this sense, therefore,

campbells theorem provides a potential link between vacuum solutions of mtheory and

tendimensional superstring backgrounds that are valid in the strong curvature and strong

coupling regimes.

it would be of interest to establish similar embeddings for other classes of exact string

solutions. in particular, we have considered backgrounds where the dilaton is a function of

10

u only, but it may also depend on the transverse coordinates xi. when the metric admits

a covariantly constant null killing vector eld and all massless excitations in the nsns

sector are nontrivial functions of xi only, the backgrounds (1) correspond to the class of

kmodels considered in refs. [14, 16]. there is also the related class of f models that
are characterized by two null killing vectors and a chiral coupling between (10)gu and b(1)
u
[13, 14]. the simplest f model is determined by a single function f (xi), where

(10)ds2 = f (xi)dudv  ijdxidxj,

f 1 = 0

(37)

and included in this class is the fundamental string solution [35]. although campbells

theorem implies that the embedding of these f models is possible in principle, the form

of the embedding will be more complicated than that considered in this work because the

ricci curvature scalar of these backgrounds is in general nonzero.

finally, it is worth remarking that campbells theorem implies that the type iib back-

grounds can also be embedded in twelvedimensional, ricciat spaces. it would be inter-

esting to explore possible consequences of this feature within the context of the recently

proposed ftheory [31]. it has been conjectured that the dimensional reduction of this

twelvedimensional theory on a twotorus reproduces the type iib theory, thereby provid-

ing a geometrical interpretation of the sl(2, z) symmetry of the theory in ten dimensions.

the interpretation of the dinstanton background of the type iib theory as the dimen-

sional reduction of a twelvedimensional gravitational wave has recently been discussed by

tseytlin [36]. the question arises as to whether other tendimensional backgrounds may be

interpreted in a similar fashion by embedding them in twelve dimensions. this may provide
further insight into the origin of the rr elds  and b(2)
 .
