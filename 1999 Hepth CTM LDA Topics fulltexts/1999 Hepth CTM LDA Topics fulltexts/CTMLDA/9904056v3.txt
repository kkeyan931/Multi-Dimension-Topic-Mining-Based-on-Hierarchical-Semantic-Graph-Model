abstract

we study the relationship between the gauge boson coupled to spin 2 oper-

ator and the singleton in three-dimensional anti-de sitter space(ads3). the

singleton can be expressed in terms of a pair of dipole ghost elds a and b

which couple to d and c operators on the boundary of ads3. these operators

form the logarithmic conformal eld theory(lcft2). using the correlation

function for logarithmic pair, we calculate the greybody factor for the single-

ton. in the low temperature limit of   t, this is compared with the result
of the bulk ads3 calculation of the gauge boson. we nd that the gauge

boson cannot be realized as a model of the ads3/lcft2 correspondence.

recently the ads/cft correspondence has attracted much interest [13]. this means

that the string/m theory on adsd+1 is dual to the gauge theory of the cftd on its boundary.

this was used to resolve many problems in black hole physics [4,5,7,8]. for the test of

the ads3/cft2 correspondence one introduces a set of test elds {i} on ads3 and their
corresponding operators {oi} on the boundary. for example, these are in the d1-d5 brane
system : a free scalar() which couples to (1,1) operator; two xed scalars(, ) to (2,2),

(3,1), and (1,3) operators; two intermediate scalars(, ) to (1,2) and (2,1) operators [9].

the relevant relation between these is given by [3]

ese ({i}) = herb

b,ioi

i.

(1)

the expectation value h  i is taken in the cft with the boundary test eld b,i as a source.
eq.(1) was widely used for calculations of the entropy, greybody factor(2-point function),

3- and 4-point functions.

it was shown by studying exchange diagram with scalar and

gauge elds in n=4 susy yang-mills from ads5 that the 4-point function has logarithmic

singularities [10]. more recently kogan proposed that a dipole ghost pair(a, b) can represent
a singleton, which induces the 2-point correlation function for a logarithmic pair(o,o) [11].
he argued that this is the origin of logarithmic singularities in the 4-point functions. this
logarithmic pair with the normalization factor c = 2(1)2/ [7] has the 2-point correlation
fucntions [12,13]

(2)

here  is a degenerate dimension  of o and o and we note a crucial relation
ho(x)o(y)i = ho(x)o(y)i

. we will use this relation to calculate the greybody factor.



in the ads3/cft2 correspondence, there exists a puzzle of the missing states between

cft2 and supergravity [14]. the gauge bosons appear in the resolution of this puzzle. these

are chiral primaries which correspond to the descendent of the identity operator in the cft2

2

[6]. but on the supergravity side these are absent and thus may be considered as unphysical

singletons on ads3 [15]. in this sense, it is important to test the relationship between gauge

boson and singleton. the authors in [16] found that these gauge bosons coupled to (2,0) and

(0,2) operators on the boundary receive logarithmic corrections from a bulk ads3 scattering

calculation. of course this was performed in the low temperature limit of   t.

in this paper, we derive the greybody factor for the singleton. according to ref.

[11], we wish to represent this with a pair of dipole ghost elds(a, b) coupled to (1,1)

operators(d, c). this means that a gauge boson with spin 2 assumed to be expressed in

terms of a pair of dipole ghost elds with spin 0. and then we calculate the two-point

function of their operators in terms of the btz coordinates. using this, we obtain the grey-

body factor. finally we will compare this with the result of a bulk ads3 scattering in the

low-temperature limit.

we start with the bulk ads3 action for a dipole pair(a, b) [12,11]

se = z d3xg(cid:20)a  b  m2ab 

1
2

b2(cid:21) .

(3)

at this stage it is not clear if this action comes from supergravity(string) theories. rather,

(3) takes a similar form of the nakanishi-lautrup formalism in the gauge theory [17].

in detail, (3) with m2 = 0 and a = a leads to the gauge-xing term as sgf =

r d3xghba + 

responds to  in [17] and leads to the negative-norm state. its equations of motion are given

2 b2i with  = 1. here b is the nakanishi-lautrup eld. a cor-

by

(cid:16)2 + m2(cid:17) a + b = 0, (cid:16)2 + m2(cid:17) b = 0.

(4)

a solution to these can be found from a boundary-bulk green function for habi with mass

(r2
+  r2
), angular momentum j = 2r+r, and left/right temperatures t = (r+  r)/2
[19]. the hawking temperature th is dened by 2/th = (1/t+ + 1/t). here u =

  t, u = u  u
convenience. to nd kaa we have to solve the equation

as far as we know, this is the rst result for a dipole ghost pair(singleton). now let us

compare this with the result of a gauge boson with s = 2 from a bulk ads3 scattering [16]

gb
abs = 2r2s2[1 + rs ln(2rs)].

(19)

for this purpose, we take the low temperature limit of   t and  = 2 on aa
case the digamma function  can take an asymptotic form as [23]

abs . in this

(1 + iy) = (1  iy)  ln y +

1
12y2 +

1

120y4 +    .

in the low temperature limit, aa

abs takes the form

aa
abs = 2r2 [1 + 2 ln(r) + c] ,

(20)

(21)

where c = 2  1  2 ln 2 with the eulers constant  = 0.5772. at the rst sight, it seems
that the (21) takes a similar form as in (19). in (19) the logarithmic term is multiplied by

r and thus it is a subleading-order. however, in (21) one cannot nd such a prefactor

6

and 2 ln(r) is regarded as the leading low energy behavior. in this sense, we argue that

there is no agreement between the ads3 calculation of gauge eld and the lcft result of a

singleton. further, the non-logarithmic terms in (21) do not agree with that of (19). if the

spin 2 gauge boson is truely represented by a pair of dipole ghost elds on ads3, from the

ads/lcft correspondence (19) should agree with (21) even in the low-temperatue limit.

hence we conclude that the gauge boson with spin 2 has nothing to do with the ads/lcft

correspondence.

on the other hand one nds the logarithmic operators in (14), which may induce the

unitarity problem. here we may resolve this problem. it is noted that these logarithmic

terms originate from the unphysical dipole ghost elds (a, b). as was shown in [17], this pair

(a, b) is turned into the zero-norm state by the goldstone dipole mechanism in minkowski

spacetime. we suggest that the boundary logarithmic terms come from the negative-norm

state of a. in order to remove the negative-norm state, we impose the subsidiary condition
as b+(x)|0iphys = 0. then the physical space(|0iphys) will not include any a-particle state.
this corresponds to the dipole mechanism to cancel the negative-norm state. similarily, we

expect that in the boundary cft2 of ads3, the theory can be managed to be unitary by

choosing an appropriate subsidiary condition.

in conclusion, we derive the new greybody factor for a singleton from the lcft2 corre-

lator hddi which corresponds to the derivative of the cft2 correlator hdci with respect
to the weight . in the low temperature limit the bulk ads3 result gb
abs does not lead to

aa
abs of the lcft2 correctly. this means that the spin 2 gauge boson cannot be expressed

in terms of a pair of dipole ghost elds (a, b).
