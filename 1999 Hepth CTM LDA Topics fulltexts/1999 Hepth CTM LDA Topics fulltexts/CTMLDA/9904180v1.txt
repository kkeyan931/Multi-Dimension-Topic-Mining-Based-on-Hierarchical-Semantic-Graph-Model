dynamical symmetry breaking in spaces with

constant negative curvature

abstract

by using the nambu-jonalasinio model, we study dynamical symmetry

breaking in spaces with constant negative curvature. we show that the phys-

ical reason for zero value of critical coupling value gc = 0 in these spaces is

connected with the eective reduction of dimension of spacetime 1+d  1+1
in the infrared region, which takes place for any dimension 1 + d. since

the laplacebeltrami operator has a gap in spaces with constant negative

curvature, such an eective reduction for scalar elds is absent and radia-

tive corrections due to the goldstone bosons are infrared nite. therefore,

dynamical symmetry breaking with the eective reduction of dimension of

spacetime for fermions in the infrared region is consistent with the mermin

wagnercoleman theorem, which forbids spontaneous symmetry breaking in

(1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime.

1 introduction.

it is well known that dynamical symmetry breaking (dsb) presents an attractive

alternative to the higgs mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking in standard

model and in a natural way solves the so called hierarchy problem connected with

the quadratic divergence of the mass of the higgs boson (for a general inroduction

to dsb see [1]). morever, dsb allows at least in principle to deduce all relevant

parameters of symmetry breaking. however, usually dsb requires strong coupling

(c  1) that essentially restricts the choice of models that can be used and it
makes also quantative studing of dsb a dicult problem. physically, it is easy to

understand why c  1. for the state with the condensate of fermion-antifermion
pairs to have lower energy than the trivial vacuum, it is necessary that energy of

the corresponding fermion-antifermion bound state be negative. then, for example,

in qed, in view of the uncertainty principle, it imples c  1. therefore, it is
very interesting to consider situations when dsb takes place in the regime of weak

coupling (c  0).

two examples of dsb in the regime of weak coupling are known. the rst is

symmetry breaking in the presence of the fermi surface (i.e. chemical potential is

nonzero). in this case, as well known from the bardeencooperschrieer theory

of superconductivity [2], a bound state forms for any (however small) attraction be-

tween fermions. the eective eld theory description of this phenomenon based on

the renormalization group was developed in [3], where it was shown that renormal-

ization group scaling takes place only in the direction perpendicular to the fermi

surface, therefore, from the viewpoint of renormalization group scaling the eective

dimension of spacetime is 1 + 1. since in two-dimensional spacetime a bound state

forms even in the case of arbitrary small attraction, we obtain that c = 0 in this

2

case. (note that this is one of key ideas of qcd color superconductivity at nite

density in the regime of weak coupling, which was actively studied in recent years

[4, 5]). the other example of dsb in the regime of weak coupling is dsb in external

constant magnetic eld. in [6] it was shown that gc = 0 in the nambujona-lasinio

(njl) model [7] in external constant magnetic eld (however small). what is the

reason for such a drastic change of the behavior of the system? (recall that gc = 1

if magnetic eld is absent.) how can however small magnetic eld change the value

of critical coupling constant from 1 to 0? at rst sight this seems wrong because

usually we expect that small perturbations lead to small changes. the physical

reason for this behavior was found in [8], where it was shown that the phenomenon

is universal (it also takes place in qed in external magnetic eld) and is connected

with the eective reduction of dimension of spacetime by two spatial dimensions

(i.e. it is 2 + 1  0 + 1 for three-dimensional and 3 + 1  1 + 1 for four-dimensional
spacetimes). indeed, charged particles can freely propagate only along the direction

of magnetic eld (for deniteness we consider (3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime). their

motion in two spatial dimensions perpendicular to magnetic eld is restricted. thus,

we have the eective reduction of spacetime by two spatial dimensions.

recently another example of dsb in the regime of weak coupling was discovered.

by using the njl-type models it was shown [9-19] that critical coupling constant

is zero in spaces with constant negative curvature (for an excellent review of dsb

in curved spacetime see [20]), i.e. chiral symmetry is always broken for any g > 0

(note that the fact of impossibility of keeping chiral invariance for free massless

fermions in spaces with negative constant curvature was also noted in [21]). the

physical explanation of this very interesting fact is lacking. the authors of these

works calculated the eective potential for an order parameter and then showed that

it has a nontrivial minimum for any g > 0. to nd an explanation of this result in

more physical terms was one of main motivations of the present work.

(7)

thus, we need to nd the diagonal heat kernel tr < x|esh|x > in spaces with
constant negative curvature. before doing it we rst describe what these spaces are

(for a very good introduction see [25]).

the d-dimensional riemannian space of constant negative curvature h d (hy-

perbolic space) can be described as a hyperboloid

0 + x2

1 + x2

 x2

2 + ... + x2

d = a2

(8)

embedded in (d+1)-dimensional minkowski space with metric ds2 = dx2
... + dx2

d. it is easy to show that the minskowski metric becomes positive denite

0 + dx2

1 +

on the surface given by eq.(8) (this is reason why we chosed the minkowski metric

in the form (, +, +,..., +)). obviously by construction hyperbolic space has the

group of isometry so(1, d) and is a homogeneous space because any two points on

h d can be connected by some isometry (all points of this space are equivalent). by

using the parametrization

x0 = a cosh , x1 = a sinh  cos 1,

x2 = a sinh  sin 1 cos 2, x3 = a sinh  sin 1 sin 2, . . . ,

(9)

5

the line element ds2 = dx2

d becomes

0 + dx2

1 + ... + dx2

ds2 = a2(d2 + sinh2 dd1),

(10)

where dd1 is the metric on unit (d-1)-dimensional sphere and the curvature is

equal to

r = 

d(d  1)

a2

.

recall that for euclidean space the linear element in spherical coordinates is

ds2 = (dr2 + r2dd1).

(11)

(12)

by comparing eq.(10) and eq.(12), we see that the dierence between at and

hyperbolic space is that the volume of sphere in hyperbolic space grows with radius

r as a2 sinh2 r
a instead r2 as in at space. in the present work we actually consider
the (d+1)-dimensional ultrastatic spacetime r  h d, where the components of
metric are time independent and the conditions g00 = 1 and g0i = 0 are true in

an appropriate system of coordinates (thus, time coordinate describes evolution of

elds on h d).

3 the eective reduction.

3.1 heat kernels.

since the metric on r  h d is time independent, the heat kernel in eq.(6) trivially
factorizes and we are left with the problem of calculation of the heat kernel
tr < x|esh|x > on the hyperbolic space h d. as we mentioned in introduction

6

it was shown that gc = 0 in spaces with constant negative curvature. the au-

thors of these works [919] calculated heat kernel in the closed form either using
the schwinger method for calculation of < x|esh|x > [24] or expressing it through
the spinor green function, which was obtained as a solution of the corresponding

dierential equation in [26]. heat kernel is in a certain sense an integral character-

istic. to reveal the underlying dynamics which gives gc = 0, we need more detailed

information about the system. for this we calculate heat kernel by summing over

the eigenfunctions of the dirac operator on h d that allows us to investigate what

dynamics is responsible for gc = 0 in spaces with negative curvature (in fact we

follow the idea of [8] where the expression for heat kernel in the form of sum over

the eigenfunctions of the dirac operator in external magnetic eld was essential).

to calculate heat kernel in the form of sum over eigenfunctions, we use the method

and the results of [27]. to illustrate the method, we rst calculate the heat kernel
for scalar eld hscalar =< x| exp s
a2 a |x >, where a =  + m2a2 and  is the
laplacebeltrami operator on h d (we will use this heat kernel when we discuss the

role of goldstone bosons), which is given by

 =

2
2 + (d  1) coth 




+ (sinh )2sd1 ,

(13)

where the last term denotes the laplacebeltrami operator on the unit sphere sd1.

if the eigenfunctions of the operator (13) are known, then we can insert their com-

plete set in the martix element for the heat kernel. then the heat kernel is repre-

sented in the form of sum over eigenfunctions

hscalar =< x|e s

a2 (+m2a2)|x >= x

e s

a2 (+m2a2)|(x)|2,

(14)

where  are eigenfunctions ( = ). it is obvious from eq.(13) that the
equation for eigenfunctions admits the separation of variables, therefore, we seek

them in the form  = f()ylm, where ylm are the spherical harmonics on sd1

sd1ylm = l(l + d  2)ylm .

7

thus, the radial wave functions satisfy the ordinary dierential equation

from which we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunctions

(18)

the radial functions are bounded at innity provided the parameter r is real, which
is equivalent to the condition   2
operator has a gap which is determined by the curvature and depends on d. since

d. thus, the spectrum of the laplacebeltrami

h d is a homogeneous space (i.e. all points are equivalent), the heat kernel does

not depend on x and one can use any point to calculate the heat kernel.

in the

spherical coordinates it is very convenient to use the origin because as follows from

the explicit solutions (eq.(16)) only modes with l = 0 are not equal to zero at this

point. we normalized eigenfunctions so that f(0) = c at x = 0. the invariant

measure dening the scalar product between eigenfunctions is

(f, f) = d1z 

0

f(sinh )d1d ,
f 

(19)

where d1 is the volume of the (d-1)-dimensional sphere and the factor sinhd1 

follows from the square root of the determinant of metric. the normalization con-

stant is determined from the usual condition of normalization of eigenfunctions of

8

continuous spectrum

(, ) = (  ).

(20)

the easiest way to calculate this scalar product and determine the normalization

constant for eigenfunctions (16) is to use the fact that the scalar product of two

eigenfunctions is expressed through the derivative of their wronskian w [,] at an
arbitrary point. for us it is most convenient to calculate the wronskian at innity

because we know the asymptotic behavior of eigenfunctions there. thus, we obtain

where the limit is taken in the sense of distributions. thus, we nd

|c(r)|2 =

2

(4)d/2(d/2)

| (ir + l + d) |2

| (ir) |2

(22)

for the square of the normalization constant. since we normalized eigenfunctions as

f(0) = c, the heat kernel is given by

hscalar =

a2 (r2+m2a2) |c 2(r)|dr,

(23)

where we have made the change of variables r = q  2

d. note that c(r)dr is the

measure of eigenfunctions. it denes the number of states per unit volume in the

range dr.

we now consider the heat kernel for the dirac operator on r  h d. before do-
ing it we rst discuss what we mean by chiral symmetry in spacetimes of arbitrary

dimension (we consider again spacetimes whose metric has minkowski spacetime

signature).

in section 2, we described the chirally invariant njl model in four-

dimensional spacetime. as well known chiral symmetry is connected with prop-

erties of representations of the cliord algebra (for a good description of spinors

in n-dimensional spacetime see, e.g., [29]). the cliord algebra for n-dimensional

spacetime of even dimension has only one complex, irreducible representation in

9

the 2n/2-dimensional spinor space. these spinors are reducible with respect to the

even subalgebra (generated by products of an even number of dirac matrices) and

split in a pair of 2n/21-component irreducible weyl spinors (n+1 = 0...n1 is

an analog of the 5 matrix in n-dimensional spacetime and 1n+1

2

are the corre-

sponding chiral projectors). in odd-dimensional spacetimes, there are two dierent

representations of the cliord algebra (they dier by the sign of the -matrices) and

chiral symmetry is not dened because n+1 is proportional to the unity. in order

to dene chiral symmetry in odd-dimensional spacetimes, it is the usual practice to

assume that fermion elds are in a reducible representation of the cliord algebra

so that we can dene an analog of chiral symmetry (for an explicit example in (2

+ 1)-dimensional spacetime see, e.g., [30]). in what follows we understand chiral

symmetry in odd-dimensional spacetimes in this sense.

in the scalar case it is easy to factorize the part of heat kernel, which contains

time derivatives.

it is a little bit more elaborated for spinors because the time

derivative is multiplied by the 0-matrix. by using (see eq.(5))

(i + m)(i  m) = (i0 + i~0 ~ + m0)00(i0 + i0~ ~  m0) =

(i0  i~~ + m0)(i0 + i~~  m0) = (i0)2  (i~ ~ + m0)2,(24)

where ~ = 0~, we get rid of the 0-matrix. it is no wonder why such an opera-

tor for the heat kernel for spatial coordinates appears after the separation of time

derivatives. indeed, the dirac equation can be written in the form of a schrodinger

equation

i


t

= h

with the hamiltonian h = i~ ~ + m, where ~ = 0~ and  = 0. therefore, we
immediately recognize our operator (i~~+m0)2 as the square of the hamiltonian,
which is obviously a positive denite operator. thus, the gap equation (see eq.(7))

10

on r  h d is

1 = gz 

1
2

ds tr < t, x|es((0)2+(i~ ~+m0)2)|t, x >,

(25)

where we again performed the wick rotation. the contribution of time derivatives

to the heat kernel is easy to found. therefore, we are left with the problem of
calculation of heat kernel on h d for the operator (i~ ~ + m0)2.

to calculate the heat kernel for the operator (i~ ~ + m0)2, we use as in the

scalar case expansion in eigenfunctions. the equation for eigenfunctions is

(i~ ~ + m0) =  .

the covariant derivative of a spinor eld on h d can be decomposed in a radial part

plus the covariant derivative along the unit s(d1)-sphere. furthermore, making the

decomposition of 2

d+1

2 -dimensional representation in a dirac-like representation of

-matrices, the equation for eigenfunctions takes the form of a coupled system (for

more details see [27])

(29)

note that the solutions remain bounded at innity if r is real. hence, the spectrum
of the dirac operator on h d is ||  m. thus, unlike the scalar case, there is no gap
for fermions on h d (this fact is very important for what follows). nevertheless, the

solutions are exponentially vanishing at innity. having determined normalization

constant, we immediately get the heat kernel for spinors on h d (again as in the

scalar case only modes with l = 0 are not equal to zero at the origin)

summation over eigenfunctions coincides with the heat kernel calculated in [26],

which is expressed through the spinor green function obtained as a solution of the

corresponding dierential equation).

12

3.2 analysis.

to interprete the heat kernel obtained, we remind the results of the corresponding

calculations in at spacetime. the gap equation in at spacetime is

1 = gz 
where hf lat = tr < x|es((
)2+m2)|x >. the eigenfunctions of the dirac operator
in at spacetime are just plane waves, therefore, the corresponding heat kernel is

(33)

thus, we see that the function kn1 denes a measure in space of eigenfunctions

and for m = 0 determines the asymptotic behavior of the heat kernel at large s.

obviously, every new dimension gives an additional factor s 1

2 to the asymptotic

behavior of the heat kernel. furthermore, we see from the gap equation (31) that in

two-dimensional spacetime g  0 if m  0 because the integral over s is divergent
on the upper limit in this case. thus, the critical value of coupling constant is zero.
we now return to the heat kernel on r  h d. it is

where the factor (4s)

2 is the contribution to the heat kernel from time coordinate

and the rest is the heat kernel on h d (see eq.(30)). let us explicitly calculate the
measure |a(r)|2, which is given by eq.(29) with l = 0. by using the formulas [28]

the asymptotic behavior of the heat kernel for large s in the case of critical

coupling constant (m = 0) is determined by the behavior of the integrand at small
r. as follows from eqs. (36) and (37), for small r, the measure |a(r)|2 tends to
a constant for any d. consequently, we obtain that the leading term of the heat
kernel (34) is hrh d  1
s . thus, the fermion dynamics on r  h d in the infrared
region corresponds to the dynamics of (1 + 1)-dimensional theory. (note that in

where e is the charge of the electron and b is magnetic eld. the heat kernel (38)

evidently also corresponds to (1 + 1)-dimensional theory in the infrared because

coth(ebs) tends to 1 for large s.

14

3.3 goldstone bosons.

in the preceding subsection we found that the dynamics of fermions in the infrared is

eectively (1 + 1)-dimensional. potentially, it may present a problem for dynamical

symmetry breaking of a continuous symmetry because, according to the coleman

merminwagner theorem [32], spontaneous symmetry breaking of a continuous sym-

metry is not possible in 1 + 1 due to strong infrared divergences connected with

massless goldstone bosons. for example, in the njl model the following diagram

of the next-to-leading (in 1

n ) correction to vacuum energy is infrared divergent in 1

+ 1:

fig. 1. the next-to-leading order correction to vacuum energy in the njl

model. the fermion propagators are denoted by solid lines. a dashed line denotes

the propagators of  and  in the leading order in 1/n.

if the eective reduction of dimension of spacetime in the infrared region were

took place for scalars, then we would had a problem connected with infrared diver-

gent radiative corrections due to massless goldstone bosons. for the case of the

eective reduction in external magnetic eld gusynin, miransky, and shovkovy [8]

presented an elegant solution of this potential problem. they indicated that since in
the case of chiral symmetry breaking the condensate < 0| |0 > is neutral and the

15

nambugoldsone bosons are neutral particles, the eective dimensional reduction

(which for fermions reects the fact that the motion of charged particles is restricted

in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic eld) does not aect the dynamics

of the center of mass of neutral excitations. therefore, as they showed by explicit

calculations the propagators of nambugoldstone bosons have (3 + 1)-dimensional

form in the infrared region. evidently such a solution cannot be used in the case of

gravitational eld because gravity is universal and all particles including goldstone

bosons directly interact with gravitational eld. therefore, we should seek another

solution. for this we look at the propagator of massless scalar eld. this propaga-

tor can be expressed through the nondiagonal heat kernel of the laplacebeltrami

operator. time dependence is trivially factorized and we are left with the problem

of calculating heat kernel on h d. in subsection 3.1 we have calculated the diagonal
heat kernel hscalar =< x|e s
a2 ()|x > (see eq.(23)). the nondiagonal heat kernel

obviously, since there is a gap in the spectrum of the laplacebeltrami operator,

there are not problems with infrared behavior of massless scalar particles. indeed,

in the proper time method infrared divergences are connected with divergence of

the integral over s on the upper limit of integration. since there is a gap in the
spectrum, the integrand has the factor e s

d . therefore, infrared divergences are

in the infrared region for fermion elds does not contradict the merminwagner

coleman theorem.

4 conclusion.

in the present paper we studied chiral symmetry breaking in the njl model in spaces

with constant negative curvature. we showed that zero value of critical coupling

constant gc = 0 is connected with the eective reduction of dimension of spacetime

1 + d  1 + 1 for fermions in the infrared region. note that this eective reduction
has universal character in the sense that the initial theory reduces in the infrared

region to two-dimensional one in the fermion sector for any dimension 1 + d. in this

respect this is similar to the eective reduction in the presence of the fermi surface

when the net fermion charge is not equal to zero.

by analysing the scalar propagator for massless goldstone bosons, we showed

that such an eective reduction is absent in the scalar sector, therefore, the eective

reduction of spacetime for fermions and symmetry breaking are consistent and there

is not a contradiction with the colemanmerminwagner theorem, which states that

spontaneous symmetry breaking is not possible in 1 + 1.

finally let us mention that the hyperbolic space h d is an euclidean analog of

anti-de sitter space (the wick rotation of ads gives h d). recently the dynamics

of quantum elds on ads received a lot of attention in view of the conjectured

cft/ads correspondence [34]. therefore, it is a natural problem to study what

the dynamics we discuss here means in the context of this correspondence. the

results of this study will be published elsewhere.
