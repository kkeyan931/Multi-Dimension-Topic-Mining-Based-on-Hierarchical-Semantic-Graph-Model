abstract

in this note we explain how world-volume geometries of d-branes can be recon-
structed within the microscopic framework where d-branes are described through
boundary conformal eld theory. we extract the (non-commutative) world-volume
algebras from the operator product expansions of open string vertex operators. for
branes in a at background with constant non-vanishing b-eld, the operator prod-
ucts are computed perturbatively to all orders in the eld strength. the resulting
series coincides with kontsevichs presentation of the moyal product. after extend-
ing these considerations to fermionic elds we conclude with some remarks on the
generalization of our approach to curved backgrounds.

introduction

it was observed many years ago that low energy eective actions of (super-)string theories
possess solitonic solutions. they are known as solitonic p-branes because of their localiza-
tion along certain p + 1-dimensional surfaces in the string-background. later, polchinski
discovered a remarkable correspondence between such solitonic p-branes and dp-branes,
i.e. boundary conditions for open strings (for a review see [1]). this makes it possible to
study branes through the microscopic techniques of boundary conformal eld theory.

in the microscopic approach, d-branes are characterized by the way in which they
couple to closed string states, i.e. by the 1-point functions of closed string vertex operators.
an immediate question is how these couplings relate to the hyper-surfaces one meets in the
macroscopic description of d-branes. here, we shall address a systematic reconstruction of
d-brane world-volumes from their world-sheet description. we argue that the information
on the geometry of the world-volumes is encoded in the operator products of open string
vertex operators. the idea to retrieve geometrical data from operator products is not
new, but so far it was mainly applied to closed string vertex operators (see e.g. [2, 3]).

when d-branes are placed in a background which carries a non-vanishing b-eld, our
procedure will lead us to a deformation of the algebra of functions on the classical world-
volume. this phenomenon was rst observed by douglas and hull [4] in the example of a
2-dimensional brane wrapping a 2-torus (see also [5, 3, 6] for more recent developments in
this direction) and it is obviously related to the structure of compactications of m(atrix)
theory on non-commutative tori [7]. let us remark that non-commutativity enters quite
naturally in a theory of open strings. in fact, open string vertex operators are inserted
along a one dimensional line (the boundary of the world-sheet) so that their insertion
points are canonically ordered. the product of two open string vertex operators usually
depends on the order in which they are inserted and hence it provides an obvious source
for non-commutative geometries.

in this short note we restrict our presentation to the case of constant b-elds on a
at background. we shall use standard techniques from conformal perturbation theory
(see e.g. [8]) to derive an explicit formula for the non-commutative multiplication in the
world-volume algebra. it will turn out as the moyal deformation of the classical algebra
of functions on the world-volume. the deformation depends on the string tension and
on the b-eld which enters through the anti-symmetric tensor b(1 + b2)1 (see eq. (3.4)
below), in agreement with the recent analysis of chu and ho [6]. at the end of the text,
we extend these considerations to the fermionic sector (see eq. (4.1)).

while some of the formulas below are not new (see e.g.

[4, 5]), our techniques are
designed for generalizations to non-trivial backgrounds and, in particular, to perturba-
tive studies in the framework of non-linear -models where the b-eld is then allowed
to depend on coordinates. the approach also displays clearly the remarkable relation
between open string theories and quantization. in the context of topological open strings
this relation is beautifully illustrated by the recent work of cattaneo and felder [9] on
kontsevichs quantization formula [10]. here, we shall see the background metric entering
the deformation and the results of topological theories appear only in a very special limit.

2 open strings and d-branes in a flat background

to set our stage, we briey consider the standard bosonic open string moving on a at
d-dimensional euclidean background, i.e. on the space rd.
its world-sheet description
involves d free bosonic elds x i(z, z), i = 1, . . . , d, living on the upper half imz  0 of the
complex plane with neumann boundary conditions imposed along the boundary imz = 0.
the explicit construction of this eld theory is encoded in the formula

x i(z, z) = xi  i


2

pi ln zz + ir 

2 xn6=0

ai
n

n (cid:0)zn + zn(cid:1) ,

(2.1)

where ai
n, n < 0 (n > 0), create (annihilate) oscillations of the open string and xi, pi
describe the strings center-of-mass coordinate and momentum. they obey the usual
commutation relations involving some constant metric gij on the background. the pa-
rameter  is the inverse of the string tension, up to some normalization.

from the free bosonic elds x i(z, z) on the upper half plane we can build many new
elds, in particular the chiral currents j i(z), j i(z) and open string vertex operators vk(x),

j i(z) = 2i x i(z, z)

,

j i(z) = 2i x i(z, z) ,

vk(x) = : ei kix i(x) :

where

x i(x) = xi  i  pi ln x + i2xn6=0

ai
n
n

xn

is the boundary value x i(x), x  r, of the bosonic eld x i(z, z). the open string vertex
operators satisfy the following elementary operator product expansions (see e.g. [8]) :

vk(x1) vk(x2) 
2ki
z  x

j i(z) vk(x)

(x1  x2)kk vk+k(x2) + . . .

vk(x) + . . .

,

j i(z) vk(x) 

for

x1 > x2 ,

(2.2)

2ki
z  x

vk(x) + . . .

.

throughout the text we shall raise and lower indices with the help of the metric g and the
product kk is dened through kk = kik
i. in all three relations we displayed only the most
singular term and represented the rest of the expansion by dots. as we remarked above,
operator products of open string vertex operators depend on the ordering of the insertion
points, in general. this is why we specied the order x1 > x2 in the rst equation, even
though we are presently dealing with a very special situation in which the relation for the
other order x1 < x2 happens to be of the same form.

there exists a more elegant formulation of eqs. (2.2) that makes use of the formal

object

f (x(x)) = v [f ](x) :=

1

(2)d/2 zrd

ddk f (k) vk(x) .

here, f (k) denotes the usual fourier transform of the function f : rd  c. the operator
product expansions (2.2) become

v [f ](1) v [g](0)  v [f g ](0) + . . .

(2.3)

note that in the rst equation we have specialized to x1 = 1, x2 = 0. the more general
formula in rel. (2.2) can be recovered with the help of conformal transformations so that
we did not lose information in passing from eqs. (2.2) to eqs. (2.3).

the rst formula in rel. (2.3) is actually quite remarkable since it describes the operator
product expansion of open string vertex operators in terms of a very simple algebraic
operation, namely in terms of the pointwise multiplication of functions on rd.

let us now change the background of our bosonic open string theory by switching on

a b-eld, i.e. by adding the following term to the action

sb =

1

4 zh

dzdz bij j i(z) j j(z) ,

(2.4)

where bij is some (constant) antisymmetric d  d matrix and the integral is performed
over the upper half plane h. our main aim is to determine the inuence sb on the
operator product of open string vertex operators. at the moment, we shall only look for
a suitable formulation of this problem. an explicit solution is then derived in the next
section.

it is well known that the only eect of the term (2.4) is to modify the boundary

condition along the real line so that the bosonic elds satisfy

yx i(z, z) = bi

j xx j(z, z) where

z = x + iy

all along the boundary z = z. the usual neumann boundary condition yx i = 0 is
recovered in the limit bij  0. we could go ahead now and construct the new theory
explicitly much as we did this for neumann boundary conditions above (see also [11],[6]).
of course, the formulas for the elds x i(z, z) and their boundary values x i(x) change
and so does the operator product expansion of the open string vertex operators, i.e. the
latter is no longer described by pointwise multiplication of functions on the background.
however, we may still think about the new operator product expansions in terms of
functions on rd, if we are prepared to deform the pointwise multiplication.
in other
words, we dene a new product (f, g) 7 f  g for functions f, g : rd  r by

(v [f ](1) v [g](0))b  v [f  g ](0) + . . .

.

(2.5)

the superscript b was placed on the left hand side to indicate that the operator product
is to be taken in a theory in which the b-eld is turned on. the multiplication  on the
right hand side depends on bij and on the parameter .

even before having constructed , we can predict some of its properties. the new
multiplication will not be commutative, in general. on the other hand, from the sewing
constraints of open string theory (see [12], [13],[14]) and the triviality of the fusing matrix

3

in a theory of free bosonic elds it is possible to deduce that  is necessarily associative.
consequently, when functions f : rd 7 r are equipped with the product  they generate a
(non-commutative) associative deformation of the algebra of functions on the background.
this algebra depends on the anti-symmetric matrix bij and on the parameter .

open strings with neumann boundary conditions can be interpreted in terms of a
d-brane that lls the whole background. we can certainly generalize our considerations
to d-branes of smaller dimension.
in this case one has to impose dirichlet boundary
conditions in some directions and only those open string vertex operators survive that
carry momentum tangential to the branes world-volume. all constructions in the sub-
sequent sections apply directly to d-branes of smaller dimension. for simplicity of the
presentation, we shall stick to the case of a background lling brane.

3 perturbation series for the deformed product

to obtain an explicit formula for the product  dened by rel. (2.5), we regard the term
sb (eq. (2.4)) as a perturbation of the original bosonic theory with neumann boundary
conditions and study the usual eld theoretic perturbation expansion. the correlators of
the perturbed theory are constructed by the standard prescription:

h1 . . . nib

z h1 . . . n esbi

n! zh
xn=0

ddzdd z h 1 . . . n

n

ya=1

biajaj ia(za) j ja(za) i .

here z := hexp(sb)i and the expressions depend on an uv-cuto  through the domain
of integration,

h
n := { (z1, . . . , zn) | im(za) >  , |za  zb| >  for a 6= b } .

as long as  is positive, the integrals are protected against divergencies caused by the
short distance singularities of the integrands 1. when dening h
n we assumed that all
elds  are inserted along the boundary. eventually, we will choose 1 = v [f ](1) and
2 = v [g](0).

the correlators in the integrand can be evaluated with the help of ward identities
for chiral currents. there exist two types of terms in these ward identities. one type
involves contractions between two currents while the second appears when we contract
currents with one of the elds . let us rst look at contractions between two currents.
their contribution to the deformed correlation functions is evaluated with the help of the
operator products expansions

similar expansions exist for the j i instead of j i. we consider a perturbing operator
inserted at the point (z, z) and assume that its anti-holomorphic current j j acts on one
of the boundary elds while the holomorphic eld j i is contracted with another current
which may be either holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. in both cases, the 2-dimensional
integral over the position (z, z) of the insertion can be converted into a contour-integral.
if we pair j i(z) with another holomorphic current, this contour-integral is easily seen to
vanish. a non-trivial contribution arises only when we contract j i(z) with some anti-
holomorphic current j k( w). after the integration, the two perturbing elds at (z, z) and
(w, w) turn out to be combined into only one insertion at (w, w) which has the form:

1

4 zh

dwd w

1
i

bj

i bjl j i(w) j l( w) .

in other words, the elds at (z, z) have disappeared leaving an insertion at (w, w) behind
which is of the same form as the original expression for sb but with 1
i b2 appearing instead
of b. iteration of this argument allows us to sum over open chains of current contractions
with arbitrary length 2. with the correct combinatorial factors lled in, the terms form
a geometric series. as a result, the perturbing elds are replaced by

sb

4 zh

dzdz (cid:18) 1

1 + ib(cid:19) l

i

blj j i(z) j j(z)

(3.2)

and we are no longer allowed to contract currents among each other. with this simple
conclusion in mind we can turn towards the discussion of the second type of contractions
in which currents act on one of the boundary elds.

from now on, let us restrict our analysis to the computation of the operator product
expansion (2.5). note that the leading contribution in the operator product expansion of
open string vertex operators is completely determined by their 3-point functions. hence,
all our previous remarks on the perturbation of correlation functions apply directly to the
perturbation of the operator product. in the following it is quite useful to decompose the
matrix in the integral (3.2) into its symmetric and anti-symmetric parts:

b

1 + ib

= s + a = 

ib2
1 + b2 +

b

1 + b2

.

(3.3)

the symmetric part s gives rise to logarithmic divergencies in the perturbation series
for the operator product. they require renormalization of the boundary elds. we shall
omit the detailed analysis at this point and only state the result: when the boundary
elds v [f ](1) and v [g](0) are properly renormalized, there remains no nite contribution
coming from s, i.e. the symmetric matrix s is completely absorbed. hence, after
renormalizing the boundary elds, we can work with the eective perturbing operator

if we no longer allow for contractions between currents. here and in the following we
neglect to write the upper index a on the anti-symmetric matrix  = a.

after all these preparations it is now straightforward to compute the deformed product

in the last step we have kept only the leading contribution from the operator product
expansion for vertex operators at b = 0. all other manipulations were exact. to un-
derstand the expression for the nth summand, it suces to look at the rst order terms.
note that the second term on the right hand side of the rst line is connected with the
action of j i on the open string vertex operator at the point x = 1 and of j j on the vertex
operator at x = 0. for the second line one needs to interchange the role of j i and j j.
there are certainly terms where both currents act on the same vertex operator. these
terms vanish since they involve a contraction of ij with the antisymmetric matrix ij.
we could certainly compute the remaining integrals in the previous expression for
operator product expansion. but we shall leave them in their present form and produce
a more compact answer by introducing the following shorthand notations:

our perturbative construction of the operator product for open string vertex operators
provides us with an explicit formula for the product f  g dened through eq. (2.5). it is
given by

f  g = xn

(4)n wn bn(f, g) .

(3.4)

the remarks above guarantee that  is associative but one may also check this directly
now. on the other hand, it is not commutative as we infer e.g. from the rst order term
in the commutator:

f  g  g  f =   ij if jg + o(()2) =   { f , g } + o(()2) ,

where  is some constant factor and we have introduced the poisson bracket { . , .}
through the second equality. the expression (3.4) for  coincides with kontsevichs for-
mula for the moyal product of functions on the background rd [10]. from this we conclude
that operator products of boundary elds give rise to the usual moyal deformation in the
direction of the poisson bi-vector

 = b (1 + b2)1 .

(3.5)

note that   b for small magnetic elds while   b1 when b2 becomes very
large. we shall refer to the region of very strong elds as topological regime. in this
limit, the metric g can be neglected in comparison to the b-eld. our results for strong
elds are consistent with the recent analysis [9] of topological -models which predicts the
deformation for large b2 to be in the direction of b1. the latter is the poisson bi-vector
associated with the symplectic form b. let us also remark that the expression (3.5) is
known from the theory of toroidal compactications where is appears as the b-eld on
the dual torus.

before we conclude this section, we would like to discuss briey how the boundary
currents j i(x) = j i(x) of the original eld theory make their appearance in the world-
volume geometry. with our previous experience on the perturbative computation of
operator products, it is rather easy to see that

(cid:0)j i(1) v [f ](0)(cid:1)b 

2
i

gij (cid:18) 1

1 + b2(cid:19)k

j

v [kf ](0) + . . .

.

hence, the chiral boundary currents describe innitesimal symmetries of the d-brane, i.e.
its world-volume algebra inherits derivations i of the form

in the limit of vanishing b-eld, i coincides with the usual derivative gijj. as one
would expect, the number of innitesimal translation symmetries of a d-brane does not
depend on the eld strength as long as the background eld is constant.

4 extension to fermionic fields

in this nal section we would like to extend our analysis to fermionic elds. we consider
a d-plet of majorana fermions described in terms of the usual (anti-)holomorphic compo-
nents i(z), i(z). there exists a choice of considering the fermionic elds in the ramond
or the neveu-schwarz sector. here we are only interested in the latter. the ramond

7

sector turns out to provide a module of the non-commutative algebra that we shall obtain
from the neveu-schwarz sector.

recall that the operator product expansions for the fermionic elds are of the form:

i(z) j(w) 

+ . . .

,

i(z) j( w) 

gij
z  w

gij
z  w

+ . . .

and similar expressions hold when holomorphic elds are replaced by anti-holomorphic
ones (and vice versa). this motivates to assign the fermionic elds i(x) = v [i](x) to
generators i of a cliord algebra with the multiplication

[ i , j ]+ = gij

.

in this way we may re-express the operator product expansions of fermionic boundary
elds in the form v [i](1)v [j](0) = v [[i, j]+](0) = v [ gij](0) = gij.

placing this theory of d majorana fermions in a non-vanishing b-eld means to perturb

the original theory by the term

s

b =

1

8 zh

dzdz bij (cid:0)i(z) j(z)  i(z)  j(z)(cid:1) .

when combined with the bosonic sector, the contribution s
the total theory with boundary conditions i
have introduced k

 = ibi

jj

b ensures supersummetry of
+ in the fermionic sector. here we

 = k  k.

our evaluation of the perturbation expansion proceeds very much as in the case of
bosonic elds. once more, contributions from chains of contractions between elds in
the perturbing operator can be summed up. this is achieved my means of the standard
formula

z idzdz f (z) z

1

z  w

= 2 f (w)

and a similar expression with the role of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic variables
b by b (1 + ib)1, if at
interchanged. the procedure allows us to replace the b-eld in s
the same time we refrain from further contractions between the eective insertions.

the aim now is to compute the leading term in the operator product expansion of
i(1) and j(0). to evaluate the contractions between the eective perturbing eld
and the boundary operators we insert the decomposition (3.3) of b(1 + ib)1 into its
symmetric and anti-symmetric parts. because of the anti-commutativity of the fermionic
elds, only the anti-symmetric matrix a enters into the nal formula for the deformed
operator product:

(cid:0)i(1) j(0)(cid:1)b

 gij + gik(cid:18) b2

1 + b2(cid:19)j

k

+ . . . = gik(cid:18) 1

1 + b2(cid:19)j

k

+ . . .

.

we can translate this result into a deformation of the cliord algebra. under the inuence
of the b-eld, the original generators i obey the deformed relations

[ i , j ]+ = gik(cid:18) 1

1 + b2(cid:19)j

k

.

(4.1)

the combination on the right hand side appeared already in eq. (3.6) for the derivations
of the world-volume algebra.

the model we have studied possesses an n = 1 supersymmetry on the world-sheet
but our considerations certainly generalize to theories with more supersymmetries. as
in the case of closed strings [2], the non-commutative world-volume geometries inherit
dirac operators from the supersymmetry generators of the eld theory. in the context of
non-commutative geometry [15], they give rise to dierential geometries on the branes
world-volumes.

5 conclusions

in this text we have constructed the world-volume geometry (eqs.
(3.4),(4.1)) of d-
branes in at backgrounds. note, however, that both the underlying concepts and the
proposed techniques can be applied beyond these simple examples.
in particular, it is
possible to study the perturbative expansion for the operator product of open string
vertex operators in non-linear -models. to treat the dependence of b-elds on co-
ordinates of the background one makes use of standard background eld methods [16].
it is quite remarkable that the resulting expansions are still organized very much as in
the corresponding version of kontsevichs quantization formula. we shall report on these
issues in a forthcoming paper.

more concretely, one may try to reconstruct the world-volume of d-branes for some
specic (cft-) backgrounds, such as e.g. the wzw-model. the classical world-volume
of branes on group manifolds is given by certain integer conjugacy classes of the group
[17] and the branes come equipped with a b-eld. in case of the su(2)-wzw theory,
their world-volumes are described by fuzzy spheres, at least in an appropriate limit [18].

it might also be interesting to study eective eld theories on general d-brane world-
volumes within the presented framework. the construction of the eective actions is a
problem in boundary perturbation theory. since the perturbing boundary operators and
the generators of the world-volume algebra appear on equal footing, it should be possi-
ble to develop a rather general approach towards eective theories on non-commutative
spaces.

the techniques of [19] provide another step in this direction. it was shown there that
non-commutativity of the boundary operator product expansion is the only obstruction in
boundary deformation theory. in this sense, a detailed knowledge about operator products
of boundary elds (and about their non-commutativity) is essential for our understanding
of general boundary ows and of d-brane moduli spaces, in particular.
