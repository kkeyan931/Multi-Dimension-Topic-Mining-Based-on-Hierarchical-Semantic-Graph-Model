recent theoretical and numerical developments show analogies between quantum chromodynam-
ics (qcd) and disordered systems in condensed matter physics. we study the spectral uctuations
of a dirac particle propagating in a nite four dimensional box in the presence of gauge elds.
we construct a model which combines efetovs approach to disordered systems with the principles
of chiral symmetry and qcd. to this end, the gauge elds are replaced with a stochastic white
noise potential, the gauge eld disorder. eective supersymmetric nonlinear models are ob-
tained. spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry is found. we rigorously derive the equivalent of
the thouless energy in qcd. connections to other lowenergy eective theories, in particular the
nambujona-lasinio model and chiral perturbation theory, are found.

the propagation of an electron in a nite sample, such
as a piece of wire, becomes diusive due to multiple scat-
tering at the impurities. the ensemble of the impurities
is referred to as disorder. the diusion constant of this
process determines, together with the size of the sample,
a universal energy scale, the thouless energy. this, in
turn, measured in units of the single particle mean level
spacing yields the dimensionless conductance of the wire,
see the review in ref. [1]. recently, it has been argued
that the gell-mannoakesrenner (gor) relation has
for qcd an analogous meaning [24], implying the exis-
tence of a thouless energy in qcd. since the thouless
energy sets the scale within which the uctuation prop-
erties are fully of wignerdyson type, it can be found by
analyzing the spectral statistics. indeed, this scale was
identied in data of lattice gauge calculations [5,6].

our goal is the description of the diusion process
for qcd by a stochastic eld theory. to this end, we
merge efetovs supersymmetric approach to disordered
systems [7] with the principles of qcd and chiral sym-
metry. this extends and complements the semiclassical
reasoning of refs. [24]. we will not use formal analo-
gies to the gor relation as in refs. [24], rather we will
derive the thouless energy as a natural result from our
stochastic model. anticipating our analytical ndings,
we draw an intuitive picture in fig. 1. due to spon-
taneous breaking of chiral symmetry, the gluonic gauge
elds in the yangmills action generate closed gluon and
fermion loops in the qcd vacuum. we may view these
vacuum uctuations as gauge eld disorder for the
propagation of a constituent quark or, more generally, of
a dirac particle in a four dimensional box of nite volume
v4. the multiple scattering at the vacuum uctuations
renders the motion of the quark diusive. in this way,
the pion decay constant and the constituent quark mass
are generated.

for our stochastic model, we introduce the euclidean

dirac operator in four dimensions

where i, i = 1, 2, 3 are the pauli matrices, 4 =
112, and g is the gauge coupling. the complex elds
u(x) describe the gauge eld disorder. we choose
them as stochastic white noise potentials with moments
hu(x)iu = 0 and hu(x)u (y)iu = (4)(x  y). the
strength constant  will be determined later. thus, the
average of a quantity r[u] is given by

hr[u]iu =z d[u]r[u] exp(cid:18)

z d4xu(x)u

this replaces in our model the average over the non
abelian gauge elds in the yangmills action.

the qcd vacuum in a box of volume v4. the vacuum uc-
tuations involve quarks (thin solid lines) and gluons (twisted
lines). the propagating quark is scattered at these vacuum
uctuations.

thus, we abandon gauge invariance, as can be seen
from eq. (2). we are free to do so because we are exclu-
sively interested in stochastic features of the spectrum.
the structure of the original gauge group enters in the
model only through the assumption that the dirac op-
erator is proportional to the unit matrix 11nc in color
space. this is fully consistent with standard models of
qcd [8,9].

the eigenvalue equation id[u]i = i[u]i denes for
each realization of the disorder potential u(x) a spectrum
{i[u]}. we wish to discuss the spectral correlation func-
tions of k eigenvalues p, p = 1, . . . , k

the energies are given proper imaginary increments to re-

can be obtained as derivatives of a generating function

(4)

where we have introduced  = diag(1, . . . , k)  12 and
j = diag(j1, . . . , jk)  k with k = diag(1, +1). in the
supersymmetry method, the generating or partition func-
tion is expressed as a functional integral over the 4  2k
component and space time dependent superelds (x)
through

zk( + j) = hdetgd[u;  + j]iu

=(cid:28)z d[] exp(cid:18)iz d4x(x)d[u;  + j](x)(cid:19)(cid:29)u

(5)

with detg denoting the superdeterminant. here, we have
dened

d[u;  + j] = ( + j)  114  112k  id[u] .

(6)

we suppress a kronecker product with 11nc. the entries
of  + j can be viewed as virtual valence quark masses.
due to the chiral structure of the dirac operator the su-
perelds (x) can be decomposed in left and right handed
parts l,r(x) = pl,r(x), where pl,r are the left and
right handed projectors acting on the dirac spinors. the
disorder average according to eq. (2) can now be per-
formed and yields a eld theory quartic in (x). similar
to the steps taken in ref. [10], it can be decoupled via
a hubbardstratonovich transformation by introducing
2k  2k complex supermatrix elds (x) such that the
elds (x) can be integrated out,

zk( + j) = 22k2z d[]d[] exp(cid:0)f [, ;  + j](cid:1) .

(7)

both, (x) and its complex conjugate (x) are indepen-
dent variables. this reects that l(x) and r(x) are
independent degrees of freedom in the chiral symmetric
phase. the free energy reads

f [, ;  + j] = trgz d4x(cid:16) 1

4g2 (x)(x)

+tr log d[, ;  + j](cid:17) .

(8)

the trace tr = trdiractrcolor in front of the logarithm is
taken over both dirac and color indices, the supertrace
trg is dened in the space of supermatrices. the super-
matrix analogue of the dirac operator is given by

d[, ;  + j] = (x)  pr + (x)  pl

+ ( + j)  114  112k  (i6 ) ,

(9)

and describes a dirac particle coupled to the superma-
trix elds (x). an important observation from eq. (9)
is that (x) is coupled only to the right handed modes
of the dirac spinors and (x) only to the left handed
modes. this implies chiral symmetry, since (x) and
(x) are independent variables.

in contrast to supersymmetry in standard high energy
physics, neither (x) nor (x) directly represent physi-
cal particles, such as quarks or mesons. rather, these
elds are the degrees of freedom in the stochastic model.
nevertheless, the functionals dened in eqs. (5) and (8)
posses certain symmetries which can be interpreted as
the supersymmetric version of particle symmetries known
from qcd. the lagrangian in eq. (5) is invariant under
the chiral transformations

ul = 112k
ur = 112k ,

l(x)  ull(x) ,
r(x)  urr(x) ,
with ul,r  su(k/k). we notice that u(k/k) is likely
to lead to axial anomalies which we do not discuss here.
the corresponding supersymmetric version of chiral sym-
metry is sul(k/k)  sur(k/k). the generating func-
tional (7) exhibits again chiral invariance

if the explicit symmetry breaking is turned o, i.e. +j =

quark masses,  + j 6= 0 which explicitly breaks chiral
symmetry. however, there is a remnant symmetry. con-
sider the case of k degenerate imaginary valence quark
masses, 1 = . . . = k = , i.e.  + j = 112k, where the
sources are set to zero. then the functional is invariant

we observe a close relation between the onepoint
function in the microscopic regime (near zero virtuality)
and the twopoint function in the bulk (far away from
zero virtuality). in both cases, the symmetry breaking
is controlled by a single parameter, although the sym-
metry groups are dierent. in the bulk, the symmetry
is broken by nondegenerate eigenvalues 1 and 2, and
the symmetry breaking parameter is  = 2  1. in the
microscopic region, the symmetry is already broken by a
nonzero eigenvalue  = 1.

in disordered systems, to make analytical progress, one
considers the eld theory via a saddle point approxima-
tion in the limit of weak disorder, i.e. for a relatively low
density of impurities. this corresponds to a born approx-
imation of the selfenergy where diagrams with crossed
interaction lines are neglected [7]. here, we proceed sim-
ilarly by a saddle point approximation of the partition
function (7) in the limit of weak gauge eld disorder.
this coincides with a 1/nc expansion, which is a stan-
dard asymptotic limit in many qcd models. these two
limits coincide because for nc   and ncg2 = const
[11,12] the relevant diagrams contributing in leading or-
der to the selfenergy within our model are analogous to
the ones in disordered systems. this shows the equiva-
lence of the 1/nc expansion and the weak disorder limit.
from the saddle point condition f [, ;  + j] = 0, we
nd the selfconsistent matrix equation in momentum
representation

where 0 and 
0 are the elds at the saddle point. a
cuto cut has to be introduced to regularize the diver-
gent momentum integration. for scalar elds, the saddle
point equation (13) coincides with the gap equation of the
nambujona-lasinio (njl) model [13]. the njl model
is a theory for chiral fermions coupled via a fourpoint
interaction. the gap equation describes the selfenergy
of a quark calculated in the selfconsistent hartree ap-
proximation obtained from a 1/nc expansion [8]. for
vanishing virtual quark masses,  + j = 0, there ex-
ists only a nontrivial solution, indicating chiral sym-
metry breaking, if the coupling exceeds a critical value
g2 > 22/nc2
cut. for nonvanishing masses, however,
one complex solution always exists, which we denote by
m 
. since the spectral density per fourvolume is given

by () = imbr1(), see eq. (3), the value of the con-

stant  in eq. (2) is now xed. from eq. (13) we nd
 = imm 

/(g2()).

in contrast to the situation in disordered systems, we
have to distinguish the microscopic and the bulk region.
in the latter, the symmetries of the saddle point solution

are still the same as given in eq. (12). a solution of the
saddle point equation is

 = iimm 

0 = 0

(14)
where l = 114 k. on the other hand, in the microscopic
region the chiral symmetry dened in eqs.(10) to (11) is
not preserved at the saddle point. the solutions read

l ,

and 0

0(x) = im eu0(x)
where eu0(x) is 2 2 unitary supermatrix eld and m  is

the nontrivial scalar solution of the gap equation (13)
for  + j = 0. we conclude that chiral symmetry is
spontaneously broken such that

(x) = im eu 

0 (x)

(15)

sur(k/k)  sul(k/k)  su(k/k) .

(16)

this is the supersymmetric analogue of spontaneous
breaking of chiral symmetry in our stochastic model.

by integrating out the quadratic uctuations around
the saddle points, we obtain, rst, a theory for the two
point correlations in the bulk and, second, a theory for
the onepoint function in the microscopic region.
in
both cases, the zeroth order term is expanded up to lin-
ear order in the symmetry breaking parameter, i.e.  in
the bulk and  in the microscopic region, respectively.
moreover, we restrict ourselves to elds varying slowly
in spacetime, allowing for a gradient expansion of the
quadratic uctuations around the saddle points. in the
bulk we obtain for the generating functional of the two
point function

z2(, , j) =z d(q) exp (f [q; , , j])

(17)

with

f [q; , , j] =

()trgz d4x (d()q(x)q(x)

2i (( + i)l + j) q(x)) ,

(18)

where  = (1 + 2)/2. the elds q(x) are the gold-
stone modes of the saddle point manifold. they are in the
coset manifold u (1, 1/2)/(u (1/1)  u (1/1)). here, l is
the symmetry breaking matrix and i a proper imaginary
increment to ensure convergence. this formally extends
efetovs result [7] to four space time dimensions. in par-
ticular, the coset spaces coincide. chiral symmetry is not
present. this is in agreement with its explicit breaking
by the virtual current mass i. the diusion coecient
d(), however, a main object of our interest, must be dif-
ferent from disordered systems because we start out from
the dirac equation. it is given as the second moment

from the competition between the kinetic and the sym-
metry breaking term one can infer the thouless energy
in the bulk. in a nite volume v4, the longest wavelength
which ts inside the euclidean box is given by the inverse
of the linear extension of the box, i.e. 1/(v4)1/4. thus,

the kinetic energy cannot be smaller than d()/v4. for

smaller energies, the wavelength exceeds the extension of
the box and does not resolve details inside it.
in that
case, the elds become constant and the functional is
dominated by the constant modes. hence, only the sym-
metry breaking term gives a contribution. then the level
statistics is of wignerdyson type. if the energy exceeds
this scale, the kinetic term becomes more and more im-
portant, leading to deviations from the wignerdyson
statistics. thus, the equivalent of the thouless energy in
the bulk is given by

where h i is the chiral condensate. obtained from the

this derivation, we used only the basic assumption (2)
and chiral symmetry. low energy theorems of qcd im-
ply that the integral in eq. (21) turns out to be propor-

(23)

in refs. [24], this formula was obtained from the gor
relation by using formal analogies and semiclassical con-
siderations. here, we gave a rigorous derivation of the dif-
fusion constant (21) from our stochastic model. finally,
we obtain for the generating functional of the onepoint
function in the microscopic regime

the supermatrices u (x) are 2  2 unitary. again, the

we note that the microscopic functional reduces, up to
irrelevant numerical factors, to the partially quenched
chiral perturbation theory (pqcpt). this is consistent
with the considerations of refs. [14,15], were pqcpt was
used to identify the equivalent of the thouless energy in
the dirac spectrum.

(26)

in summary, we presented a stochastic eld theory by
merging efetovs approach to disordered systems with
the standard principles of qcd and chiral symmetry.
due to the latter, we obtain dierent theories in the mi-
croscopic and the bulk region which connect to the njl
model and pqcpt. the thouless energy is a natural con-
sequence of our model. in conclusion, we wish to make a
proposal: since we now have a detailed and, importantly,
quantitative description of the spectral uctuations in
qcd, it would be worthwhile to use this insight as an
input for lattice qcd, either by constructing eective
models or by modifying the algorithms accordingly. it
would be highly desirable if this made lattice qcd more
ecient.
