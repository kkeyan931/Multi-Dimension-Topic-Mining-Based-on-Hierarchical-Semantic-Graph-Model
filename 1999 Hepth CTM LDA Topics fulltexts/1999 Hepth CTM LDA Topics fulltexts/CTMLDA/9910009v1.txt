in a vector-like gauge theory, conventional wisdom says that, except for the explicitly
broken ua(1) symmetry of the avor axial-vector current of fermions by instantons of
the gauge elds, the other global avor chiral symmetries will be spontaneously broken.
coleman and witten [1] have established spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in the
large nc limit of quantum chromodynamics. although a great deal of work exists on
this subject [2] using several approaches, a general rigorous proof of this however is not
known . as pointed out by weinberg [3], it can be shown that su(3)su(3) symmetry
for massless u, d, s quarks must in fact be spontaneously broken in qcd but it is more
dicult to show on the basis of qcd that the su(2)  su(2) symmetry with only u, d
massless quarks is also spontaneously broken.

as emphasized by adler [4], two of the relativistic eld theory models which exhibit
dynamical spontaneous scale invariance breaking are: 1) johnson-baker-wiley model
[5] of quantum electrodynamics in which chiral symmetry is explicitly broken and 2)
asymptotically free gauge theories (qcd) in which chiral symmetry is spontaneously
broken. thus it is the sense that the underlying theory exhibiting spontaneously broken
scale invariance cannot be manifestly chiral symmetric (wigner-weyl mode). however,
two models do not appear to be a large enough sample for such a generalization although
the result itself might be suggestive.

we shall rst establish the following result by the method of reductio ad absurdum:
connement and asymptotic freedom imply that scale invariance must be broken spon-
taneously in quantum chromodynamics (qcd) with quarks and gluons.

unbroken scale invariance states that

where

qd(t) |0 >= 0,

qd(t) = z d3x d0(x, t)

(1)

(2)

is the dilatation charge dened in terms of d(x, t), the dilatation current. this is
equivalent to

d |0 >= 0.

(3)

we may now invoke colemans theorem [6], which is based on the federbush-johnson-
jost-schroer theorem [7, 8, 9]. this is valid for continuous symmetries and states that

1

the invariance of the vacuum is the invariance of the world. consequently the divergence
of the dilatation current must vanish identically:

d = 0.

(4)

on the other hand, the divergence of the dilatation current is determined by the trace
anomaly in qcd [10]:

d =

1
2

(g)

g

ga

g

a +xi

mi[1 + i()] i i.

(5)

the second term vanishes since mi = 0, i = u, d, s in the chiral limit. consequently, the
beta function must vanish:

(g) = 0.

(6)

we observe that the callan-symanzik beta function is gauge independent in the minimal
subtraction scheme in qcd [11]. now we can ask where the zero of the beta function
is: either when g = g  6= 0 or when g = 0. we know that the asymptotically free theory
of qcd must have g = 0 as an ultraviolet stable xed point. the beta function which
due to asymptotic freedom is negative at small coupling (provided nf  16), remains
negative for all couplings in such a way that the eective coupling constant grows without
bounds at large distances (i.e., quark connement) [12]. in other words, connement
requires that the curve of (g) as a function of g remains below the positive g axis,
decreases as g increases and never turns over [13]. this rules out the rst possibility. as
a consequence, the only possible solution is

g = 0

(7)

and the theory is reduced to a triviality.

we therefore conclude by reductio ad absurdum, that scale invariance must be broken

spontaneously by the qcd vacuum state:

qd(t) |0 >6= 0.

(8)

since qcd is a nontrivial theory with g 6= 0, scale invariance is also explicitly broken by
the trace anomaly, as in eq.(5), as a consequence, there is no goldstone theorem [16]
and there is no dilaton. in other words, scale invariance is broken both spontaneously
by the vacuum state and explicitly by the trace anomaly.

2

at this point we shall rst establish the vanishing of the commutator of the dilatation

charge qd(t)and the axial charge qa

5(t) at t = 0.

we shall begin with the fact that qa(0), a = 1, 2,    , 8, the generators of su(3)

transformations satisfy the algebra

this can be consistent with

[ qa(0), qb(0) ] = ifabcqc(0).

[ qd(0), qa(0) ] = idqqa(0)

(9)

(10)

only if [14] the scale dimension of charge is zero: dq = 0 . this can be explicitly proved
as follows.

consider the double commutator

[qd(0), [qa(0), qb(0)]] = ifabc[qd(0), qc(0)] = fabcdqqc(0).

(11)

employing jacobi identity, this reduces to

 idq[qa(0), qb(0)] + idq[qb(0), qa(0)] = fabcdqqc(0)

(12)

which can be satised only if dq = 0. we can now extend this to the axial-charge qa
by employing the commutators

5

[qa

5(t), qb

5(t)] = ifabcqc(t),

and

[qd(0), qa

5(0)] = idq5qa

5(0),

(13)

(14)

where dq5 is the scale dimension of the axial-charge. evaluating the double commutator
of the above with qd(0), we nd

[qd(0), [qa

5(0), qb

5(0))]] = ifabc[qd(0), qc(0)] = dqfabcqc(0) = 0.

if we now employ jacobi identity, we obtain

 2idq5[qa

5(0), qb

5(0)] = 2dq5fabcqc(0) = 0.

3

(15)

(16)

again, this can be satised only if the scale dimension of the axial charge vanishes:
dq5 = 0 and hence it follows that [qd(0), qa
5(0)] = 0. by introducing eiht on the
left, eiht on the right and 1 = eiht eiht in the middle, we further establish the
vanishing of the commutator of the dilatation charge and the axial charge for any time:
[qd(t), qa

5(t)] = 0.

we shall now establish the result that spontaneously broken scale invariance implies
spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. we shall again employ the method of reductio
ad absurdum. we have already proved that scale invariance is spontaneously broken
and thus qd(t)|0 >6= 0. this means that the dilatation charge does not annihilate the
vacuum but instead the operation produces another state: qd(t)|0 >= |1(t) >, and
|1(t) >6= |0 >. the dilatation charge is time dependent and hence does not commute
with the hamiltonian. as a result, the states produced by repeated application of the
dilatation charge operator are neither vacuum states nor necessarily degenerate. does
spontaneously broken scale invariance imply spontaneously broken chiral symmetry? let
us assume to the contrary that chiral symmetry is unbroken, qa
5(t)
and qd(t) commute, we therefore obtain

5(t)|0 >= 0. since qa

qa

5(t)qd(t)|0 >= qa

5(t)|1(t) >= qd(t)qa

5(t)|0 >= 0.

(17)

hence we conclude that qa
and by the same reasoning obtain the result

5(t)|1(t) >= 0. next we may consider qa

5(t)qd(t)|1(t) >

qa

5(t)qd(t)|1(t) >= qa

5(t)|2(t) >= qd(t)qa

5(t)|1(t) >= 0.

(18)

hence we deduce: qa
in this manner we nd that the axial charge
annihilates all the states |1(t) >, |2(t) >, |3(t) > and so on, ad innitum, where
|0 >6= |1(t) >6= |2(t) >6= |3(t) >. we thus have deduced the result

5(t)|2(t) >= 0.

qa

5(t)|n(t) >= 0, n = 1, 2, 3,    .

(19)

clearly eq.(19) is satised only for the wigner-weyl mode, i.e., if |n(t) >= |0 >,
for all n, up to a unitary transformation u which commutes with 5. however, the
states |n(t) > are neither vacuum eigenstates nor are they necessarily degenerate since
qd(t) 6= 0 by virtue of the trace anomaly. as a consequence, any identication of broken
scale vacuum with chirally symmetric vacuum is wrong and must be rejected. hence we
conclude by reductio ad absurdum that qa
5(t)|0 >6= 0: that chiral symmetry must be
spontaneously broken.

4

we may also infer the connection between the states |n(t) > and the degenerate
5(t)|0 >6= 0 and qd(t)|0 >6= 0, we derive from
5(t)] = 0 that qa
5(t)|0 >=
5(t)|0 >= |0 >6= |0 >. hence we determine that
5)1(t)qd(t)|0 > is the desired connection between hidden scale symmetry
5(t)|0 >6= 0.

vacuum states as follows. since qa
the commutator property [qd(t), qa
qd(t)|0 > where |0 > is dened by qa
|1(t) >= (qa
and hidden chiral symmetry. we note that the inverse of qa

5(t)|1(t) >= qd(t)qa

5(t) exists since qa

spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is signied by the non-vanishing anti-com-

mutator in qcd:

{ 5, s 1(p) } 6= 0.

(20)

the form of the inverse quark propagator is given by [15] in the limit of zero mass u, d, s
quarks:

s 1(p) = /pa(p2)  d(p2)

(21)

where d(p2) is the dynamical quark mass. this corresponds to the form of the quark
propagator in the covariant gauge in the presence of gluons in quantum chromodynam-
ics. the function a is really a function of the dimensionless variable p2/2 where  is
the subtraction point. the above arguments are valid also for su(2)  su(2) with fabc
replaced by abc.

we can now address the question of goldstone theorem [16] in qcd. following
cornwalls analysis [17], we examine ward-takahashi identity satised by the proper,
renormalized, color singlet, avor non-singlet axial-vector current vertex function in
qcd in the limit of zero mass u, d, s quarks:

qa

5(p, p) = zaz 1

2 (cid:20)s 1(p)5

1
2

a + 5

1
2

as 1(p)(cid:21) ,

(22)

where q = p  p, a is the avor su(3) matrix and a = 1, 2,    , 8. since we have
established that chiral symmetry must be broken spontaneously, signied by

n5, s 1(p)o 6= 0,

qa

5(p, p) = 2zaz 1

2 5

1
2

ad(p2) 6= 0.

it follows that

we therefore have

q

(23)

(24)

(25)

where the omitted terms are regular [17] at q = 0 and hence the axial-vector vertex
function must have a pole at q2 = 0. this establishes goldstone theorem in qcd.

in conclusion, we have dealt with the question of chiral symmetric mode in qcd
and the nambu-goldstone realization of chiral symmetry. it is known that the choice
between these two is no longer free for us. indeed, the theory itself should, in principle,
tell us whether the symmetry or part of it is spontaneously broken or not [18]. this
is precisely what we have attempted to do in this work by utilizing colemans theorem
and by employing the twin ingredients of asymptotic freedom and connement in qcd.

it is interesting to note that marciano and pagels [13] observed that the deeper
connection between the trace anomaly and the qcd mass spectrum and connement,
if it exists, remains to be understood. we believe we have shed some light on this
question.
