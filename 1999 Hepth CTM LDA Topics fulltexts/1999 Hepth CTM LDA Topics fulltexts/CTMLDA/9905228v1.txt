abstract

we examine the dynamics induced on the four dimensional boundary of a ve
dimensional anti-desitter spacetime by the ve dimensional chern-simons theory
with gauge group the direct product of so(4, 2) with u (1). we show that, given
boundary conditions compatible with the geometry of 5d ads spacetime in the
asymptotic region, the induced surface theory is the w zw4 model.

1 introduction

it may be possible to understand the physics of elds which propogate
through space in terms of physics on the boundary of space [1]. for example,
even though 3d einstein gravity has no local dynamics, black holes possess
thermodynamic properties. the resolution of this seeming paradox is that
the dynamical processes responsible reside on the boundary of 3d spacetime.
this idea was broached by carlip [2] with the boundary dynamics occurring
on the event horizon. later strominger [3], motivated by earlier work of
brown and henneaux [4] and by string theory, showed that states on the
boundary at innity could also account for 3d black hole thermodynamics.
this has been generalized in a variety of ways to dierent species of black
holes in higher dimensions [5, 6, 7].

what is a common element of all implementations of this program to date
is the construction of integrable eld theories on some boundary of space-
time. for instance, in 3d, the boundary theory is a version of the 2d wzw
model [8]. characteristically for integrable eld theories, the wzw theories
contain an innite number of conserved charges, or equivalently, an innite
dimensional kac-moody algebra obeyed by the currents. the association of
this algebra with conformal symmetry leads to the characterization of this
phenomena as an example of the ads/cft correspondence [9].

the starting point for the construction of the boundary theories is usually
einstein gravity or some generalization thereof. however, the initial work in
3d used the close correspondence of einstein gravity in that dimensionality
with chern-simons theory. the reason for this is the fact that in the latter it
is comparatively straightforward to distangle gauge from dynamical degrees
of freedom.

a natural question to ask at this point is if this situation is a consequence
of einstein gravity, or is it more generic? in fact, there is some evidence
that it is not generic. banados et. al[10] have analyzed higher dimensional
chern-simons theories on manifolds with boundary. they found that in fact
the algebras (in diverse spacetime dimensions) of charges on the boundary
are not the kac-moody algebra, but rather generalizations that they call
w zw4 algebras. these are known in the mathematical literature as toroidal
lie algebras [11]. they generalize the kac-moody algebra in the sense that
while the kac-moody algebra is the loop algebra with a central charge, the
n-toroidal lie algebras replace the loop with an n-torus.

the w zw4 theory (sometimes known as the nair-schi or kahler chern-

1

simons theory) is a four dimensional non-linear eld theory which is a natural
generalization of the 2d wzw model. some of its properties have been
developed in the papers of nair, nair and schi, and losev et. al.
[12].
for example it is classically and perhaps quantum mechanically integrable
and one-loop renormalizable.
it was shown by inami et. al.[13] that the
associated current algebra is the 2-toroidal lie algebra. the same authors
have also formulated a 2n-dimensional generalization of the w zw4 theory
[14].

banados et. al.[10] do not explicitly derive the w zw4 boundary theory
from 5d chern-simons. they construct the algebra of gauge charges on the
boundary under the assumption that the gauge group is the direct product
of some non-abelian group g and the abelian group u(1). the purpose
of this letter is to ll in this last important step: we will show that with
boundary conditions compatible with the geometry of 5d ads spacetime in
the asymptotic region, the induced surface theory is precisely the w zw4
model.

we consider the chern-simons theory on a ve dimensional manifold with

boundary. the bulk part of the action is:

scs[ a] = zm

t r(cid:26) a(d a)2 +

a5 +

3
5

3
2

a3d a(cid:27) .

(1)

in the above a = abjb is a one form that takes its values in the lie algebra
lg with generators jb, and the wedge product is always implied in products
of forms. we assume that the group g has an invariant symmetric non-
degenerate quadratic form:

gab = t r(jajb).

(2)

unlike the three dimensional case, the above action describes a theory
that does have dynamical degrees of freedom. however, in the case when the
gauge group is the direct product of the conformal group so(4, 2) with the
abelian group u(1), there is a generic sector of the phase space wherein
there are no dynamical degrees of freedom in the bulk of the manifold, al-
though there are propagating modes on the boundary [10]. we therefore
choose the gauge group g to be the direct product of so(4,1)u(1). de-
noting the generators of so(4,2) by ja and the u(1) generator by j1, the
connection 1-form decomposes as:

a = a + a,

2

(3)

where a = aaja and a = a1j1. we can take j1 to be the identity, so that a
is just a real function over m 5. hence, the action reads (up to an irrelevant
surface term):

scs[ a] = scs[a] + 3zm

t r(ada +

2
3

a3),

(4)

where  = da is the abelian eld strength. variation of the action eq.(4)
yields:

scs[ a] = 3z t r(f 2a) + 6z t r(a) + 3z t r(f 2)a + sb,

(5)

where f = da + a2 and the last term is a boundary variation of the form:

sb = im (cid:20)t r(ada + daa +

3
2

a3 + 3a)a + 3(ada +

2
3

a3)a(cid:21) . (6)

the eld equations for the bulk modes of the theory are therefore:

t r {(f  f + 2f  ) ja} = 0,
t r(f  f ) = gabf a  f b = 0.

(7)
(8)

we will consider solutions of the form f = 0 and  arbitrary but not zero.
such solutions are generic in the sense of [10]. note that the presence of the
boundary variation sb makes the variational principle of the action scs[ a]
ill dened as given. it is therefore necessary to add a compensating surface
term to the action whose variation precisely cancels sb. this compensating
surface term is determined by the choice of boundary conditions and plays a
crucial role in determining the boundary dynamics.

in section 2 we use the hamiltonian form of the action in order to re-
derive the 2-toroidal lie algebra of boundary currents. in section 3 we will
show how to express 5d anti-desitter geometry in terms of so(4, 2) chern-
simons gauge theory. this will determine the asymptotic form of the gauge
potential corresponding to the leading order contributions to the ads metric
and spin connection in the asymptotic region of ads spacetime. finally
we will show that with boundary conditions compatible with the latter, the
boundary theory is the w zw4 theory. section 4 closes with a summary and
conclusions.

2 surface dynamics

we will now show that the dynamics of the physical modes in the sector of
the theory we are considering takes place at the boundaries of the manifold
m.
in particular we will derive the symplectic form on the hamiltonian
constraint surface and show that it is a total divergence. we start with the
action in hamiltonian form. in what follows we follow the procedure outlined
in [10, 16].

scs[ a] = z dtz

since a priori there is no metric on the 5d manifold m, we use the fact that
in a small enough region m    ir and we single out one coordinate x0 to
parametrize ir, and call  space. we write y := y/x0. in the above the
ab

(13)

on the sector of the constraint surface given by f a
of motion eq.(13) insure that the remaining components f a

ij = 0, ij 6= 0 the equations

0i = 0.

we now calculate the variation of the kinetic term in the action under
arbitrary variations of the gauge potential on the sector of the constraint
surface under consideration. using f a

ij = 0, ij 6= 0, we nd:

scs = z dtz

t r( aa)

.

(14)

since the connection a is at, we can write a = h1dh where h is an element
of so(4, 2). thus a = d(h1h),

scs = z dtz

= z dti

a = d(h1 h) and
t rhd(h1 h)d(h1h)i .
t rhd(h1 h)(h1h)i ,

(15)

where d denotes the covariant derivativee along the boundary . the last
line in the above was obtained by integrating by parts and using the fact
that dd  f = 0. eq.(15) denes the sympletic form and shows that the
physical modes live on the boundary of , in complete analogy with the
results obtained by banados[16] for 3-d chern-simons gravity.

dening the conserved current:

j = h1dh,

we nd the associated lie algebra valued charges:

q := j0 =

1
2

ijkijh1kh.

expressing eq.(15) in terms of the charges q we get

scs = z dtz

t r(cid:16) q l1q(cid:17) ,

where we have dened the operator

l =

ijkijdk,

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

which is assumed to be invertible (i.e. we exclude zero modes). using eq.(18)
we calculate the poisson bracket:

{qa(x), qb(y)} =

ij(x)ijkd

k (x)3(x  y)

2 (cid:16)f a

cdgbcqd + ijkijkgab(cid:17) 3(x  y),

(20)

where the f a
bc are of the so(4,2) structure constants. the algebra eq.(20) is
the 2-toroidal lie algebra, that is, the current algebra for the w zw4 theory
[13]. it is a non-trivial central extension of the lie algebra of so(4,2). it
generalizes the ane kac-moody algebra in that the latter is the centrally
extended loop algebra with one central charge; while the 2-toroidal alge-
bra is the centrally extended algebra of maps from a 2-torus to the (nite
dimensional) lie algebra in question.

3 ads boundary conditions and the w zw4

model

so far we have not dealt with the fact that in general the chern-simons
action is not functionally dierentiable. the problem is that the variation
of the action results in boundary terms sb as given in eq.(6) which may
not vanish on-shell for the appropriate boundary conditions. the idea is to
add to the bulk action a surface term whose variation cancels the unwanted
boundary term for the given boundary conditions. in the case of 3d chern
simons theory, this procedure results in the wzw model on the 2d boundary
[8]. we will now show that the boundary terms in the variation of the action
can be integrated to give surface terms which are essentially the w zw4
model. in order to carry this out, we impose boundary conditions which are
consistent with those of the metric and spin-connection for the asymptotic
region of 5d ads spacetime.
the ads metric in 5d is

ds2 =   r2

r2 + 1! dt2 +  r2

r2 + 1!1

dr2 + r2d2,

(21)

where d2 is the metric on the 3-sphere. in the asymptotic region r  
the leading order terms in the frame eld and spin-connection are:

the rst condition we impose on the boundary is that the connection a is
at. in this case we can simplify the boundary variation by replacing ada by
a3. moreover, we have veried by explicit calculation using maple that
t r(a3a) = 0 for all lie algebra valued a and a. the boundary variation
reduces to:

sb = 3zm (cid:18)t r(aa) + (ada +

2
3

a3)a)(cid:19) .

(24)

we also assume that  is a xed two form on the boundary so that the
variation a of the u(1) gauge potential must be of the form a = d, for
some scalar . integrating by parts and using the fact that f (a) = 0 we nd
that the second term in eq.(24) vanishes.

we assume that  is a xed two form lying in a two dimensional subspace

of m, with coordinates , , say. then we have that:

sb = 3zm

t r(azaz)

.

(25)

if we assume, as carlip did for the 2+1 dimensional case[17], that az is xed
on the boundary, this can be trivially integrated so that the complete action,
including boundary term is eq.(4) supplemented with the boundary term:

s = scs[a] + 3zm

t r(ada +

2
3

a3) + 3zm

t r(azaz)

.

(26)

recalling that on shell f [a] = 0, we can parametrize the gauge potential as
a = h1dh. what we are left with is the gauge dependent part of the action,
namely:

s =

t r(h1dh)5 + sw zw 4,

(27)

where

sw zw 4 = zm

1

10 zm
t r(h1dh)3 + 3zm

t r[(h1h)(h1 h)],

(28)

is the w zw4 action[18, 13]. the rst term in eq.

(27), namely p5 :=

(1/10)rm 5 t r(h1dh)5, is the winding number of maps from m 5 to 5-spheres
in the group manifold so(4,2); i.e.
it takes its values in the cohomology
h 5(m 5, 5(so(4, 2))). since 5(so(4, 2)) = 5(so(4)) = z2  z2 the wind-
ing number is zero [18] and p5 does not contribute to the dynamics of the
w zw4 theory. the same is not true of the rst term in eq.(28), which is
necessary for the one-loop niteness of w zw4- see losev et. al. in [12] and
[20].

4 conclusion

we have examined the 5d chern-simons theory with gauge group so(4, 2) 
u(1) on a manifold with boundary. we have looked at the sector of phase
space wherein the so(4, 2) connection is at and the u(1) connection is xed
but not at. these conditions are obeyed by a connection constructed from
the frame-elds and spin-connection of anti-desitter spacetime. we then
consider the case that these conditions are imposed as boundary conditions
on the connection. we have shown that, analogous to the case of 3d chern-
simons theory on a manifold with boundary, there is a non-trivial eld theory
induced on the boundary, namely the w zw4 theory. the latter has the 2-
toroidal lie algebra as the algebra of observables.

we are currently examining the 5d black hole thermodynamics and sta-

tistical mechanics arising from our results.
