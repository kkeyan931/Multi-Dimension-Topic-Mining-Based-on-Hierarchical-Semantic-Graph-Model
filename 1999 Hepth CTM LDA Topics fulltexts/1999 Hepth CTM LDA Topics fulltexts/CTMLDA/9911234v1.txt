abstract

we construct the general model with only parallel positive tension 3-branes
on m 4  r1 and m 4  r1/z2. for any point in m 4  r1 and m 4  r1/z2,
which is not belong to any brane and the interval ( at most one interval ) be-
tween the two branes where the metric does not have warp factor, there is a
neighborhood which is dieomorphic to ( or a slice of ) ads5 space. in this
general scenario, the 5-dimensional gut scale on each brane can be indentied
as the 5-dimensional planck scale, but, the 4-dimensional planck scale is gen-
erated from the low 4-dimensional gut scale exponentially in our world. we
also give 4 simple models to show explicitly how to solve the gauge hierarchy
problem. one new feature is that, sometimes, the 5-dimensional planck scale
might be very large because of the exponential factor.

1 introduction

experiments at lep and tevatron have given the strong support to the standard
model of the strong and electroweak interactions. however, the standard model has
some unattractive features which may imply the new physics beyond the standard
model. one of these problems is that the gauge forces and the gravitational force are
not unied. another is the gauge hierarchy problem between the weak scale and the
4-dimensional planck scale. previously, two solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem
have been proposed: one is the idea of the technicolor and compositeness which lacks
calculability, and the other is the idea of supersymmetry.

more than one year ago, it was suggested that the large compactied extra
dimensions may also be the solution to the gauge hierarchy problem [1]. furthermore,
half year ago, randall and sundrum [2] proposed another scenario that the extra
dimension is an orbifold, and the size of the extra dimension is not large but the 4-
dimensional mass scale in the standard model is suppressed by an exponential factor
from 5-dimensional mass scale. in addition, they suggested that the fth dimension
might be innity [3], and there may exist only one brane with positive tension at
the origin, but, there exists the gauge hierarchy problem. the remarkable aspect
of the second scenario is that it gives rise to a localized graviton eld. combining
those results, lykken and randall obtained the following physical picture [4]: the
graviton is localized on planck brane, we live on a brane separated from the planck
brane about 30 planck lengths along the fth dimension. on our brane, the mass
scale in the standard model is suppressed exponentially, which gives the low energy
scale. we generalized those scenarios and obtained the scenario with the following
property [15]: the 4-dimensional planck scale is generated from the low 5-dimensional
planck scale by an exponential hierarchy, and the mass scale in the standard model,
which is contained in the observable brane, is not rescaled. in short, recently, this
kind of compactication or similar idea has attracted a lot of attentions [5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].

in the model building, almost all the models [2, 4, 12, 15, 18, 26, 27] which can
solve the gauge hierarchy problem contain the branes with the negative brane tension
except lykken-randall model and oda model 1. however, mathematically speaking,
lykken-randall model [4] may not be strict because they neglected the eect from
the observable brane tension which they assumed might be very small, and in oda
model [26], the transformation is not 1-1 and may not be topological invariant. we
want to consider the model with only positive tension branes, because, as we know,
an object with negative tension can not be stable, although we might not need to
worry about it if the anti-brane is orientable 2. in addition, there are positive energy
objects, namely d-branes and ns-branes, that are well understood and on which
gauge elds and matter elds can be localized so that the standard model elds can

brane junctions will be considered elsewhere [17].

before our discussion, we would like to explain our assumption and notation
which are similar to those in [15]. we assume that all the gauge forces are unied
on each 3-brane if there exist gauge forces. the 5-dimensional gut scale on i-th
3-brane m5(i)
gu t and the 5-dimensional planck scale mx are dened as the gut
scale and planck scale in the 5-dimensional fundamental metric, respectively. the 4-
dimensional gut scale on i-th 3-brane m (i)
gu t and the 4-dimenisonal planck scale mpl
are dened as the gut scale and planck scale in the 4-dimensional minkowski metric
(). in order to avoid the gauge hierarchy problem between the weak scale and the
4-dimensional gut scale mgu t on the observable brane which includes our world,
we assume the low energy unication 3. the key ansatz is that the 5-dimensional
gut scale on each brane is equal to the 5-dimensional planck scale.

in this paper, we construct the general model with only parallel positive tension
3-branes. if the fth dimension is compact, the sum of the brane tensions is zero which
is the topological invariant of this kind of models [16]. therefore, we have to go to
the non-compact fth dimension case. from dierential topology/manifold, up to
homotopy, there is only one connected non-compact 1-dimensional manifold: r1, and
there is only one connected non-compact 1-dimensional manifold with boundary: h1
or r1/z2 ( the equivalence class is y  y ). therefore, the space-time we consider is
m 4  r1 and m 4  r1/z2 where m 4 is the 4-dimensional minkowski space-time. the
parallel positive tension 3-branes are located along the fth dimension. we construct
the most general model with above properties, calculate the 4-dimensional planck
scale and gut scale on each brane.
it seems to us the gauge hierarchy problem
can be solved easily in this scenario: the 5-dimensional gut scale on each brane
can be indentied as the 5-dimensional planck scale, but, the 4-dimensional planck
scale is generated from the low 4-dimensional gut scale exponentially in our world.
the cosmology constant is not constant along the fth dimension, however, it is
constant between any two adjacent branes, and between +/   and the brane
with maximum/minimum fth dimension coordinate. so, for any point in m 4  r1
and m 4  r1/z2, which is not belong to any brane and the interval ( at most one
interval) between the two branes where the metric has no warp factor, there is a
neighborhood which is dieomorphic to ( or a slice of ) ads5 space. furthermore,
we also give 4 simple models: two branes with dierent brane tensions, two branes
with the same brane tensions, three branes with z2 symmetry, four branes with z2
symmetry. the gauge hierarchy problem is solved explicitly in those models. one
new feature is that, sometimes, the 5-dimensional planck scale might be very large
because of the exponential factor.

3we will not explain why mgu t can be low energy scale here, but, it is possible if one considers
additional particles which change the rge running. of course, proton decay might be the problem,
but we do not disscuss this here.

2 general solution and model

first, we consider the fth dimension is r1. assuming we have l + m + 1 parallel
positive tension 3-branes, and their fth coordinastes are:  < yl < yl+1 < ... <
y1 < y0 < y1 < ... < ym1 < ym < +. the 5-dimensional metric in these branes
are:
(1)

(x)  g(x, y = yi) ,
g(i)

where gab is the ve-dimensional metric, and a, b = , y 4.

the classical lagrangian is given by:

s = sgravity + sb ,

sgravity = z d4x dy g{(y) +

m 3

sb =

m

xi=lz d4xqg(i){li  vi} ,

(2)

(3)

(4)

where mx is the 5-dimensional planck scale, (y) is the cosmology constant, and vi
where i = l, ..., m is the brane tension. the (y) is dened as the following:

m

(y) =

xi=1
i ((y  yi1)  (y  yi)) + (y  ym)
xi=l+1

i ((y + yi)  (y + yi1)) + (y + yl) ,

+

0

where (x) = 1 for x  0 and (x) = 0 for x < 0.

the 5-dimensional einstein equation for the above action is:

g(cid:18)rab

gabr(cid:19) = 
xi=l

viqg(i) g(i)

n (y  yi)] .

(5)

(6)

assuming that there exists a solution that respects 4-dimensional poincare invariance
in the x-directions, one obtains the 5-dimensional metric:

ds2 = e2(y)dxdx + dy2 .

(7)

4 we assume that g5 = 0 here. in addition, if the fth dimesnion has z2 symmetry, i. e., the

lagrangian is invariant under the transformation y  y, then, g5 = 0.

3

with this metric, the einstein equation reduces to:

2 = (y)
6m 3
x

,  =

m

xi=l

vi
3m 3

(y  yi) .

the general solution to above dierential equations is:

(y) =

m

xi=l

ki|y  yi| + c ,

(8)

(9)

where ki > 0 and c is a constant. the relations between the ki and vi, and the
relations between the ki and i are:

vi = 6kim 3

i = 6m 3

xj=l

(10)

(11)

therefore, the cosmology constant is negative except the interval ( at most one interval
) between the two branes where the cosmology constant is zero, then, for any point in
m 4  r1 and m 4  r1/z2, which is not belong to any brane and that interval, there
is a neighborhood which is dieomorphic to ( or a slice of ) ads5 space. moreover,
the cosmology constant and brane tensions should satisfy above equations.

in short, the general bulk metric is:

ds2 = e2pm

i=l ki|yyi|2cdxdx + dy2 .

and the corresponding 4-dimensional planck scale is:

where

pl = m 3

xi=l

ti,i+1
 ,

t,l =

e2(yl) , tm,+ =

e2(ym) ,

if i,i+1 6= 0, then

and if i,i+1 = 0, then

ti,i+1 =

1

2i,i+1 (cid:16)e2(yi+1)  e2(yi)(cid:17) ,
ti,i+1 = (yi+1  yi)e2(yi) ,

where

 =

xj=i+1

kj 

i

xj=l

kj .

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

by the way, one can easily prove that ti,i+1 is positive, which makes sure that the
4-dimensional planck scale is positive.

in addition, the four dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m (i)

gu t is related to

the ve dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m5(i)

gu t :

m (i)

gu t = m5(i)

gu t e(yi) .

(18)

in this paper, we assume that m5(i)

gu t  mx, for i = l, ..., m.

this solution can be generalized to the solution with z2 symmetry. there
are two kinds of such models, one is the odd number of the branes, the other is
the even number of the branes. for the rst one, one just requires that ki = ki,
yi = yi, and m = l. for the second case, one just requires that ki = ki, yi = yi,
m = l, and k0 = 0 (no number 0 brane). furthermore, the solution can also be
generalized to the case in which the fth dimension is r1/z2, one just requires that
ki = ki, yi = yi, m = l, then introduces the equivalence classes: y  y and
i  th brane  (i)  th brane. the only trick point in this case is that the brane
tension v0 is half of the original value, i. e., v0 = 3k0m 3
x.
from eqs. (13) and (18), we obtain that the gauge hierarchy problem can be
solved easily in this kind of scenario ( with more than 1 brane ): the 5-dimensional
gut scale on each brane can be indentied as the 5-dimensional planck scale, but,
the 4-dimensional planck scale is generated from the low 4-dimensional gut scale
exponentially in our world.

3 four simple models

randall and sundrum constructed the model with only one 3-brane which is the sim-
plest model in above general construction [3]. however, the gauge hierarchy problem
is not solved in that model. in this section, we will give four explicit simple models
without gauge hierarchy problem.

first, let us consider two 3-branes with dierent brane tensions: the rst brane
with brane tension k0 and position y0, and the second brane with brane tension k1
and position y1. without loss of generality, we assume that k0 > k1. one obtains
mpl, and the 4-dimensional gut scales on the two branes:

m 2

pl =

m 3
x
2

e2k1(y1y0)2c  2k0
0  k2
k2
gu t ek1(y1y0)c , m (1)

+

1

gu t = m5(0)

m (0)
gu t = m5(1)

2k1
k2
1  k2

0

e2(k0k1)(y1y0)! ,
gu t ek0(y1y0)c ,

gu t = m5(1)

(19)

(20)

where m5(0)
gu t = mx. assuming the brane with position y1 is the observ-
able brane which includes our world, we can solve the gauge hierarchy problem. for
example, assuming that k0 = 2k1, k1 = mx and e2(k0k1)(y1y0) << 1, one obtains:

pl = 2m 2
m 2

xe2k1(y1y0)2c ,

(21)

5

m (1)

gu t =

1
21/4 mple(k0k1)(y1y0) .

(22)

so, we can push the gut scale in our world to tev scale and 105 gev scale range
if (k0  k1)(y1  y0) = 34.5 and 30, respectively. and the value of k1(y1  y0) + c
determines the relation between mpl and mx. for instance, if c = k1(y1  y0), we
have mpl = 21/4mx, and if c = 0, mx > mpl.
if the brane with position y0 is the observable brane which includes our world,
and

we can solve the gauge hierarchy problem, too. assuming that mpl = k2
e2(k0k1)(y1y0) is small, we obtain:

0k2
k0

1

mpl = mxe 2

3 k1(y1y0) 2c

3 , m (0)

gu t = mple 1

3 k1(y1y0) 1

3 c ,

(23)

with k1(y1  y0) + c = 103.5 and 90, we can have gut scale in our world at tev
scale and 105 gev scale, respectively. obviously, in this case, because of the expo-
nential factor, the ve dimensional planck scale is very high, 1048 gev and 1044 gev,
respectively 5.

second, let us consider two 3-branes with equal brane tension k, the rst
brane with position y1, and the second brane with position y1. for the simplicity,
we assume that y1 = y1 > 0. one obtains mpl, and the 4-dimensional gut scales
on the two branes:

m 2

pl = m 3
x(

+ 2y1)e4ky12c ,

1
2k

(24)

(25)

m (1)

gu t = m5(1)

gu t e2ky1c , m (1)

gu t = m5(1)

gu t e2ky1c ,

where m5(1)
observable brane, we obtain:

gu t = m5(1)

gu t = mx. assuming that the brane with position y1 is the

mpl = m (1)

gu tsmx(

1
2k

+ 2y1) .

(26)

we can not solve the gauge hierarchy problem if mx  k  y1
1 . however, if mx  k,
we might solve the gauge hierarchy problem if y1 is very large. furthermore, if
mpl =

, we obtain:

2k

1 + 4ky1

mpl = mxe 4

3 ky1 2

3 c , m (1)

gu t = mple 2

3 ky1 1

3 c ,

(27)

with 2ky1 + c = 103.5 and 90, we can push the gut scale in our world to the tev
scale and 105 gev scale, respectively. and the ve dimensional planck scale is 1048
gev and 1044 gev, respectively.

5 one might think there might exist mass hierarchy between the k0 or k1 and mx , but, here, the

fth dimension is non-compact. moreover, if k0  k1  mx, we can require k0  k1 very small.

6

third, we consider three 3-branes with z2 symmetry, their positions are y1,
0, y1, respectively, and their brane tensions are k1, k0, k1, respectively. one obtains
mpl, and the 4-dimensional gut scales on the branes at y=0 and at y=y1:

m 2

pl = m 3

xe4k1y12c  1
gu t e2k1y1c , m (1)

k0 

2k1

(2k1 + k0)k0

e2k0y1! ,

m (0)

gu t = m5(0)

gu t = m5(1)

gu t e2k1y1k0y1c ,

(28)

(29)

gu t = m5(1)

where m5(0)
gu t = mx. assuming the brane with position y1 is the observ-
able brane, we can solve the gauge hierarchy problem. for example, if e2k0y1 << 1
and k0 = mx, one obtains:

mpl = mxe2k1y1c , m (1)

gu t = mplek0y1 .

(30)

with k0y1 = 34.5 and 30, the gut scale in our world will be tev scale and 105 gev
scale, respectively. and the relation between mpl and mx depends on the value of
2k1y1 + c.

if the brane with position y = 0 is the observable brane, the gauge hierarchy
problem can be solved, too. assuming mpl = k0 and e2k0y1 is very small, we obtain:

mpl = mxe 4

3 k1y1 2

3 c , m (0)

gu t = mple 2

3 k1y1 1

3 c ,

(31)

with 2k1y1 + c = 103.5 and 90, we can push the gut scale in our world to the tev
scale and 105 gev scale range, respectively. and the ve dimensional planck scale is
1048 gev and 1044 gev, respectively.

last, we consider four 3-branes with z2 symmetry, their positions are y2,
y1, y1, y2, respectively, and their brane tensions are k2, k1, k1, k2, respectively. one
obtains mpl, and the 4-dimensional gut scales on the branes at y=y1 and at y=y2:

m 2

pl =

m 3

gu t = m5(1)
gu t = m5(2)

1
k1

)e4k1(y2y1)(cid:19) ,
gu t e2(k1+k2)y2c ,

(32)

(33)

where m5(1)
gu t = mx. assuming the brane with position y = y2 is the
observable brane, we try to solve the gauge hierarchy problem. if e4k1(y2y1) << 1
and mx = k1 = (4y1)1, we obtain:

mpl = mxe2k1y12k2y2c , m (2)

gu t = mple2k1(y2y1) .

(34)

with k1(y2  y1) =17.25, 15, we can have gut scale in our world at tev scale and
105 gev scale, respectively. and the value of 2k1y1 +2k2y2 +c determines the relation
between mpl and mx.

7

if the brane with position y = y1 is the observable brane, we can solve the
and e4k1(y2y1) is very

2k1

gauge hierarchy problem, too. assuming mpl =
small, we obtain:

1 + 4k1y1

mpl = mxe 4

3 (k1y1+k2y2) 2

3 c , m (1)

gu t = mple 2

3 (k1y1+k2y2) 1

3 c ,

(35)

with 2(k1y1 + k2y2) + c = 103.5 and 90, the gut scale in our world will be pushed
to tev scale and 105 gev scale range, respectively. and the ve dimensional planck
scale is 1048 gev and 1044 gev, respectively.
