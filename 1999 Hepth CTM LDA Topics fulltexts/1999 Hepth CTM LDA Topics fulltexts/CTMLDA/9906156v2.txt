we demonstrate the reparametrization invariance of perturbatively dened one-dimensional func-
tional integrals up to the three-loop level for a path integral of a quantum-mechanical point particle
in a box. we exhibit the origin of the failure of earlier authors to establish reparametrization in-
variance which led them to introduce, superuously, a compensating potential depending on the
connection of the coordinate system. we show that problems with invariance are absent by dening
path integrals as the   0 -limit of 1 + -dimensional functional integrals.

1. the long-standing problem of the reparametrization invariance of perturbatively dened one-dimensional func-
tional integrals, called path integrals, has recently become an important issue in the context of worldline formulations
of quantum eld theory [14]. this problem was apparently rst encountered in two-loop perturbative calculations in
ref. [5], and a solution was attempted once more in ref. [6]. the latter authors exhibited in great detail the change
of results obtained after subjecting a path integral to a coordinate transformation. the results could only be forced
to agree by adding to the tranformed action an articial potential term, of the order h2, depending on the connection
of the coordinate transformation.

such a noninvariance under coordinate transformations, if unavoidable, would be extremely unpleasant for two
reasons: first, the functional integral of the much more complicated quantum gravity is known to be invariant under
coordinate transformations if the innities are regularized a la t hooft and veltman [7] in 4   dimensions, and it
would be surprising to see a failure in simple quantum mechanics. second, a similar initially encountered problem
in the time-sliced denition of path integrals has been solved elegantly in the textbook (11), by dening it as the
image of a euclidean path integral (in curved space via a nonholonomic coordinate transformations). it would be
embarrassing if a perturbative denition on a continuous time axis which is standard in quantum eld theory would
fail to match the invariance of the time-sliced denition.

an brief inspection of the problems encountered in refs. [5,6] reveals immediately the central unsatisfactory feature
of their treatment. the perturbation expansion of the transformed path integral leads to feynman integrals involving
space-dependent kinetic terms whose result depends on the order of evaluation of the individual one-dimensional
momentum integrals. as a typical example, take the feynman integral

y = z dk

2

dp1
2

dp2
2

(k2 + m2)(p2

1 + m2)(p2

k2 (p1p2)
2 + m2)[(k + p1 + p2)2 + m2]

.

integrating this rst over k, then over p1 and p2 yields 3/64m. in the order rst p1, then p2 and k, we nd 1/64m.
as we shall see below, the correct result is the average og the two, 1/32m.
the purpose of this note is to exhibit the origin of this ambiguity and to remove it by a proper denition of the
path integral as the analytic continuation of a corresponding functional integral in d spacetime dimensions to d = 1.
this leads to a unique result exhibiting the desired reparametrization invariance. for the above example, the correct
result turns out to be the arithmetic-average of the two answers, i.e., y = 1/32m [to appear in the rst term of the
decomposition of the feynman integral in eq. (40)]. the ambiguity will be removed by a denite contraction of the
momentum vectors in the numerator. a typical example characterizing the resukting uniqueness that the integral

whose numerator vanished trivially in d = 1 dimensions. because of the dierent contractions in d dimensions,
however, y0 has a nite value y0 = 1/32m (1/32m) in the limit d  1, the result being split according to the two
terms in the numerator [to appear in the feynman integrals (39) and (40)].

to be specic, we consider a simple quantum-mechanical system, a point particle in a one-dimensional box of size
d. the ground-state energy of this system is exactly known, e(0) = 2/2d2, and a method has been developed to
recover this value perturbatively [8], where a three-loop calculation yields the expansion

e(0) =

m
2

+

g

+

16

g2
m

+ o(g3).

(1)

here g is a coupling constant which is equal to 2/d2, and m an infrared regulator to be taken to zero at the end.
this regulator comes about by replacing the conning box by a smooth convex potential which grows to innity near
the walls, and replacing the free-particle euclidean action, the eld energy, as follows:

e0[u] = z l/2

l/2

dx u2(x)  e[u] = z l/2

l/2

dx(cid:8) u2(x) + m2g1 tan2 [gu(x)](cid:9) ,

(2)

where l is the total euclidean time interval. being interested only in the ground state energy, this may be assumed
to be very large, and the limits of integration will be omitted from now on. for m  0, the initial box is recovered.
the d  , the particle is completely free (g = 0). at nite d, the potential is expanded in powers of g, and the
connected feynman vacuum diagrams up to three loops produce the perturbation expansion (1).
the evaluation of the series (1) requires a conversion from the weak- to a strong-coupling expansion, for which the

techniques are now well developed [9] and described for this model in [8].

we shall now perform a coordinate transformation on this action and show that the ensuing perturbation expansion
leads to the same expansion of the energy (1). as announced in the beginning, a unique path integral will be obtained
only if it is dened as a d  1 -limit of a d-dimensional system. the initial action will therefore be extended
accordingly, replacing r dx by r ddx, and the kinetic term u2(x) by [u(x)]2.

2. the coordinate transformation to be applied to (2) is

the partition function of the transformed action in d dimensions is given by the euclidean path integral (in natural
units)

u(x)  (x)  g1 tan [gu(x)] .

(3)

with the transformed eld energy

z = z du(x) er ddxej []er ddxe[],

e[] =

1

2 z ddx(cid:8)[u((x))]2 + m2 2(x)(cid:9) ,

and an eective eld energy ej [] coming from the jacobian of the coordinate transformation:

ej [] = (d)(0)z ddx

u(x)
(x)

,

where (d)(0)  r ddp/(2)d is the inverse lattice volume associated with each points in spacetime.

inserting (3) into (5), and expanding everything in powers of g, the transformed energy becomes

with a harmonic part

and an interacting part

e[] = em[] + eint[],

em[] =

1

2 z ddxn[(x)]2 + m22(x)o ,

eint[] =

1

2 z ddx[(x)]2 (cid:0)2g2 + 3g24  4g36 + . . .(cid:1) .

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

in the limit of large spacetime volume ld, the harmonic part of the partition function gives an expression which

can immediatly be taken to d = 1 dimensions:

2

zm = etr log( 2+m2) = const.  elm/2,

(10)

contributing the zeroth-order term m/2 to the expansion (1). this is the exact result for the partition function (4) in
the limit d  , where the walls are absent.
for a nite distance d, we perform a perturbation expansion in powers of g around this zm using feynman diagrams.
by discarding all disconnected diagrams, the expansion applied directly to ground state energy. since the interaction
terms in (9) have various forms, there exists a variety of feynman diagrams. there are three types of dierent
two-point functions,

(x, x) = h(x)(x)i = z

ddk
(2)d

eik(xx)
k2 + m2 = (x, x),

and its derivatives

the innitely many interaction vertices are pictures as follows:

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

when calculating feynman integrals in momentum space of arbitrary dimensions d, the quantity (d)(0) =

r ddk/(2)d in the jacobian energy (6) vanishes and can be dropped from the exponent in (4). thus we nd,

up to the three-loop level, the following graphical expansion for the free energy density

f =

(16)

at the two-loop level, there exists only one diagram representing the single wick contraction hihi of the local
expectation value h2()2i. at the three-loop level, the diagram
pictures one of the three equal nonzero wick
contractions hihihi of the local expectation value h4()2i. the remaining three-loop diagrams are either
of the three-bubble type, or of the watermelon type, each with all possible combinations of the three line types. since
the local expectation value h i vanishes according to eq. (12), several three-bubble diagrams do not contribute.
only those which do are shown in eq. (16).
3. all diagrams of eq. (16) converge in momentum space, thus requiring no regularization to make them nite, as
we would expect for a quantum mechanical system. trouble arises, however, in some multiple momentum integrals,
since they yield dierent results depending on the order of their evaluation. the ambiguity discussed in the beginning
occurs in the diagram is
. this and related diagrams require a calculation in d dimensions, and going to the
limit d  1.
the diagrams which need a careful tratment are easily recognized in conguration space, where the one-dimensional
propagator (11) is the continuous function. (x, x) = (1/2m)em|xx|.
its rst derivative has a jump at equal
arguments and is a distribution which is unproblematic as long as the remaining integrand does not contain -
functions or their derivatives. these appear with second derivatives of (x, x), where the d-dimensional evaluation
msut be invoked to obtain a uniwue result.

the loop integrals encountered in d dimensions are based on the basic one-loop integral

where we have set ddk  ddk/(2)d, for brevity. for d = 1, i is equal to 1/2m. by dierentiation with respect to
m2 we can easily generalize (17) to

j(p) repeatedly with respect to p, we obtain the generalizations of j(p):

j 1...n = z

various two- and three-loop integrals needed for the calculation can be brought to the generic form

k(a, b) = z ddp (p2)aj b(p), a  0, b  1, a  b,

(29)

and evaluated recursively as follows [11]: from the feynman parametrization of the rst line of eq. (23) we observe
that the two basic integrals (17) and (23) satisfy the dierential equation

j(p) =

dierentiating k(a + 1, b) from eq. (29) with respect to m2, and using eq. (30), we nd the recursion relation

k(a, b) =

2b(d/2  1) i k(a  1, b  1)  2m2(2a  2  b + d)k(a  1, b)

(b + 1)d/2  2b + a

,

which may be solved for increasing a starting with

k(0, 0) = 0,

k(0, 1) = z ddp j(p) = i 2,

k(0, 2) = z ddp j 2(p) = a,

the one-dimensional limit on the right-hand side follows directly from the conguration space version of this integral

with the help of eqs. (31) and (32), we nd further integrals appearing in three-loop diagrams:

z ddp p2j(p) = k(1, 1) = 2m2i 2,
z ddp p2 j 2(p) = k(1, 2) =

(40)

note that since the conguration space integral of this diagram contains no -functions, it could have been calculated
immediately in one dimension where (x, x) becomes (1/2)(x x)em|x|, so that the integral over dd1 reduces
to r 

 dx[(1/2)em|x|]4 = 1/32m.

4. summing up all contributions of the various diagrams, we nd for the free energy density up to three loops the

perturbation expansion

this is identical with the previous result (1), thus conrming the invariance of the perturbatively dened path integral
under coordinate transformations, so that there is no need for an articial potential term of the order h2 called for
by previous authors.
