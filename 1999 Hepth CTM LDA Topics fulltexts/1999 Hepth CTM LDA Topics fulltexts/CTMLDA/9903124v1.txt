interconnections between type ii superstrings,
m theory and n = 4 supersymmetric yangmills

michael b. green

department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics,

silver street, cambridge cb3 9ew, uk

these lecture notes1 begin with a review of the rst nonleading con-
tributions to the derivative expansion of the m theory eective ac-
tion compactied on a two-torus. the form of these higher-derivative
interactions is shown to follow from ten-dimensional type iib super-
symmetry as well as from one-loop quantum corrections to classical
eleven-dimensional supergravity. the detailed information concern-
ing d-instanton eects encoded in these terms is related to the prob-
lem of evaluating the witten index for n d-particles in the type iia
theory. using the ads/cft conjecture, it also leads to very specic
predictions of multi-instanton contributions in n = 4 supersymmet-
ric su (n ) yangmills theory in the limit of strong t hooft coupling.

introduction

the incalculable in full pursuit of the ineable2

over the past few years a number of very interesting nonperturbative aspects
of string theory have emerged and are encapsulated in the term m theory. the
precise meaning of this term is open to a multitude of interpretations although a
common theme is that m theory represents a framework for describing nonper-
turbative quantum gravity that reduces to perturbative string theory or classical
eleven-dimensional supergravity in various limits. although there have been at-
tempts to give a microscopic denition of m theory it is not at all obvious that
the correct concepts have yet been discovered. nevertheless, certain fascinat-
ing features are emerging that will surely be of lasting signicance. foremost
among these is the interplay between quantum gravity and yangmills gauge
theory, which has been suggested by the structure of string perturbation the-
ory for many years but has recently come to the fore in the realization of the
holographic principle in the context of the ads/cft correspondence.

the point of view followed in these notes is that it is of interest to unravel
the extent to which features of the theory emerge purely as a consequence of
its very large symmetries and do not depend on the microscopic model. all
present formulations of string theory and its m theory extensions depend in some
manner on the background. obviously this is not a satisfactory state of aairs
for a quantum theory of gravity. in practise, this means that the properties of
the theory depend on the number of moduli of the particular background chosen.
the number of moduli grows with the number of compact dimensions  there
are no moduli in eleven dimensions while the ten-dimensional type iia theory
has a single modulus (the dilaton) and the ten-dimensional type iib theory has
two moduli (associated with the complex scalar eld). in lower dimensions the
number of moduli increases further and there is a corresponding increase in
the size of the duality group. in order to avoid the possibility of terminological
confusion the term m theory will be restricted in these notes to apply to the low
energy expansion of eleven-dimensional supergravity compactied on specied
backgrounds3.

overview

in section 2 we will begin with a brief review of the classical relationships
between m theory compactied on a two-torus, t 2, to nine dimensions and the
two type ii superstring theories compactied on a circle, s1. these are con-

gurations with maximal supersymmetry  there are 32 unbroken components
in the supercharges. the nine-dimensional duality group is sl(2, zz) and there
are three scalar moduli elds that parameterize the three-dimensional coset
space sl(2, zz)\sl(2, ir)/u (1)  r. the scalars may be identied with the
volume and the complex structure of t 2. the duality properties were originally
motivated [1, 2, 3] by comparison of the classical (einsteinhilbert) eleven-
dimensional action [4] with the classical low energy string type ii string actions.
furthermore, the bps states of the theories also coincide. for example, there
are states in which the m2-brane (the membrane solution of eleven-dimensional
supergravity) is wrapped around the two-cycles of t 2. such states are inter-
preted in the string theories as fundamental string states with the string wound
around the circle that forms the tenth dimension. this is a simple illustra-
tion of the more general network of dualities that relate all the dierent string
perturbation theories and eleven-dimensional supergravity [5, 1].

the duality that is manifested by the low energy eective actions of eleven-
dimensional supergravity and type ii string theories is supposed to extend to
the complete quantum theories. we will consider the expansion of the quantum
eective action in powers of derivatives on the elds. thus, in string theory
language the wilsonian action will be expanded in inverse powers of the string
tension4,

4s = 4(s(0) + s(1) + . . . + ()ns(n) + . . .),

(1.1)

where, by dimensional analysis, each power of  implicitly comes with two
derivatives on bosonic elds whereas a fermionic eld counts as a half power
of a derivative, as usual. obviously an expansion such as (1.1) is of limited
value since it does not capture eects that are nonperturbative in . the
leading term, s(0), contains the classical einsteinhilbert action and all the
terms related by supersymmetry. we will use this notation even in the case of the
type iib theory where there is a well-known diculty since there is no globally
well-dened action for the self-dual ve-form eld strength, f5. however, for the
most part we will only use the notion of an action as a shorthand for packaging
the equations of motion, which are well-dened. for such purposes a locally
well-dened action, such as that in [6, 7], is sucient. the rst nonzero terms
beyond s(0) are those in s(3) which has a coecient 1. a striking example
is the topological term in type iia ten-dimensional string theory,

form neveu-schwarzneveu-schwarz (n s  n s) antisymmetric tensor poten-
tial. this term, with its precisely determined overall coecient, can be discov-
ered directly from a one-loop string [8] calculation in which the stringy regulator
plays a crucial role in regulating an otherwise quadratically divergent diagram.
it can also be discovered by considering the cancellation of chiral gravitational
anomalies in the type iia ve-brane. these anomalies arise from the coupling
of the world-volume chiral fermions and self-dual antisymmetric three-form eld
strength to the pull-back of the target space gravitational eld. in the presence
of a ve-brane (1.2) transforms anomalously under local dieomorphisms and
local lorentz transformations in just the correct manner to cancel the world-
volume anomaly. this is an example of the anomaly inow mechanism for
cancelling local anomalies [9], which was the method used in [10] to derive the
generalization of the term (1.2) to eleven-dimensional supergravity where it is
the integral of an eleven-form, c(3)  x8. both of these arguments for the
presence of the term (1.2) are outside the realm of perturbative quantum eld
theory  the rst method invokes a stringy cuto while the second method
requires consistency of nonperturbative solitonic chiral ve-branes.

obviously (1.2) is not the only higher derivative term in the eective ac-
tion. there will be terms with arbitrarily high numbers of derivatives as well
as terms that are nonperturbative in . as we will see, the large amount
of supersymmetry severely constrains the form of certain classes of protected
terms in the eective action. whereas the classical type iib supergravity (the
supersymmetrized einstein theory) is invariant under continuous sl(2,ir) trans-
formations the iib superstring only possesses a discrete (local) sl(2, zz). this
means that the quantum eective action only possesses this discrete symmetry
which must be a symmetry order by order in .

the rst corrections to the einsteinhilbert term are of order 1 (3
relative to the leading term). one such term is a specic contraction of four
riemann curvatures that only involves the weyl tensor components (recall that
the weyl tensor is the part of the riemann tensor that is trace-free). in the
type iib theory this term, which will be denoted by r4, must have the form (in
string frame) [11],

where  is a complex scalar eld,

z d10xge/2f (0,0)(,  )r4,

  1 + i2 = c(0) + ie,

(1.3)

(1.4)

and c(0) is the ramondramond (r  r) pseudoscalar eld and  is the type
iib dilaton eld (which will sometimes be written as b in order to distin-
guish it from the type iia dilaton). the power of e/2 in (1.3) cancels after

4

transformation to the einstein frame,

g  ge e/2,

(1.5)

where ge is the einstein-frame metric. in this frame the curvature is invariant
under sl(2, zz) so that the function f (0,0)(,  ) must be a scalar under sl(2, zz)
transformations which act as

 

a + b
c + d

,

(1.6)

with integer a, b, c, d : ad  bc = 1. the notation in (1.3) has been cho-
sen with later generalizations in mind where we will encounter modular forms,
f (w, w)(,  ), where the superscripts (w, w) denote holomorphic and antiholo-
morphic weights. the string coupling constant is proportional to e when  is
constant. it follows that the large 2 = e expansion of f (0,0) must reproduce
the terms that are known in the perturbative type iib string expansion [11, 12].
it will also include exponentially suppressed terms that correspond to the pres-
ence of arbitrary numbers of d-instantons that will be discussed in subsequent
sections.

at the linearixed level the physical elds of iib supergravity package together
into a constrained on-shell supereld that is a function of a so(9, 1) grassmann
spinor,  [13]. in section 3 this will be used to express the r4 term, together
with many other interaction terms of the same dimension, in terms of an integral
over the sixteen components of , which is half the total number of components
of the two type iib supersymmetries. this makes manifest the fact that these
terms of order 1 are related by supersymmetry at the linearised level. we will
refer to terms such as these that are integrals over a fraction of the superspace
as protected terms. generally these interactions violate the u (1) r symmetry
of the classical type iib theory. for example, among such terms is one of the
form [14]

where  is the complex dilatino which is a sixteen-component chiral so(9,1)
spinor. the nonholomorphic modular form, f (12,12), transforms with a phase
under sl(2, zz) in a manner that cancels the phase transformation of the di-
latino. the characteristic feature of these terms is that the linearized approx-
imation is a good approximation for the d-instanton contributions but not for
the perturbative contributions of zero instanton number. the sixteen compo-
nents of  are identied as the components of supersymmetry that are broken
in the d-instanton background [11, 14].

the constraints imposed by the full nonlinear supersymmetry in the type
iib theory will be the subject of section 4 where the terms of order 1 in

5

z d10xge/2f (12,12)(,  )16,

(1.7)

the derivative expansion of the eective action of type iib supergravity will be
deduced by requiring the closure of the superalgebra at this order [15]. this is
a kind of noether procedure that implements supersymmetry up to any given
order in . in this manner terms we shall determine not only the terms in s(3)
but certain of the modied supersymmetry transformations that relate s(3) to
the classical action s(0). we will see that supersymmetry requires that the
functions of the moduli f (w,w)(,  ) are eigenfunctions of the laplace operator
on the poincare upper-half plane with specic eigenvalues that depend on w.
assuming that the theory is invariant under sl(2, zz) determines the solutions
uniquely.

we will see in section 5 that the protected higher-derivative terms, such as
f (0,0) r4 can be deduced by consideration of one-loop feynman diagrams in the
eleven-dimensional theory compactied on t 2 [16]. thus, the r4 term will be
deduced by considering the one-loop scattering of four gravitons. this amplitude
can be expressed as a sum over windings around the torus of the world-line of
the particle circulating in the loop. the dependence on the moduli of the
torus emerges from the sectors of nonzero winding while the ultraviolet (uv)
divergence is contained in the zero-winding sector. since the supergravity eld
theory is not renormalizable these uv divergences cannot be interpreted in the
absence of a microscopic denition of m theory (just as string theory regulates
the ultraviolet divergences in ten-dimensional supergravity). however, with any
sensible regularization this term is proportional to the volume of the torus and it
disappears in the limit in which the torus has zero volume. but this is the limit
in which m theory is identied with the ten-dimensional type iib theory. we will
nd that the expression for the r4 term that was deduced from supersymmetry
in section 4 is reproduced by this one-loop calculation. more generally, for
nite volume, there are volume-dependent terms that are ill-dened due to the
uv divergence. however, if the condition of t-duality, that relates the type
iib and iia string theories in nine dimensions is imposed, then the regularized
coecients are determined uniquely and there are no ambiguities. having xed
the value of the regularized divergence the eleven-dimensional limit may be
recovered with a specic nite coecient for the r4 term5.
in similar fashion the other terms of order 1 can be obtained from one-
loop processes in m theory on t 2. the interaction of sixteen dilatini, 16, will
also be considered in detail in section 5. this involves the evaluation of a sixteen-
gravitino amplitude in which the gravitini are polarized in appropriate directions
with respect to the two-torus so as to be interpreted as spin-1/2 dialtini in the

5 for related work in toroidally compactied type ii theories see [17, 18] and in type i
theories see [19, 20, 21]. sl(2, zz)-invariant expressions for higher-dimensional terms in the
type iib eective action have also been proposed in [22, 23, 24, 25, 26].

iib theory [14]. in this case there is no eleven-dimensional divergence at all and
the loop amplitude is proportional to the modular form f (12,12).

the structure of these o(1) interactions will be analyzed further in section
6. the large 2 (small coupling) expansion of any of these terms is determined by
writing the modular form, f (w,w)(,  ), as a fourier series in powers of e2i1,
which is a series of d-instanton terms. the zero fourier mode contains the
perturbative contributions (powers of  1
2 ) which consist of the tree-level and
one-loop terms with no higher-order power behaved terms. the absence of per-
turbative terms beyond one loop points to a perturbative non-renormalization
theorem which is a consequence of the fact that the protected interactions can
be expressed as integrals over half the superspace.6 the charge-k d-instanton
contribution is correlated with a phase factor e2ik1. the signicant 2 de-
pendence of the charge-k d-instanton term is contained in the bessel function
k1(2|k|2) which has a large-2 expansion that is suppressed by the expo-
nential factor e2|k|2(1 + o( 1
)). the coecient of the leading charge-k
d-instanton contribution will be found to be (with suitable normalization)

2

m2 ,

xm|k

(1.8)

where the notation indicates a sum over all the divisors of k. on the other hand,
an extension of ideas in [30] suggest that this d-instanton measure should be
identied with the partition function of the su (k) zero-dimensional matrix
model, that is the compactication to zero dimensions of ten-dimensional su-
persymmetric yangmills theory. in this manner we will be able to deduce the
partition function for arbitrary k.

the k d-instanton measure is related to the problem of evaluating the
witten index for k d-particles which will be the subject of section 7 [31].
the chain of duality relations between string theory and eleven-dimensional
supergravity requires that there be precisely one threshold bound state of k
d-particles of charge k [1]. this means that the witten index for the k d-
particle system must be equal to one. the case of two d-particles (k = 2) was
considered in detail in [32, 33] where it was noted that the witten index has two
contributions  the bulk term is equal to the zero-dimensional matrix model
partition function while the boundary term is obtained from the region of
moduli in which the two d-particles can be described as identical free particles.
we will see how these ideas generalize to arbitrary k. the bulk term in the
index is now given by the zero-dimensional matrix model partition function for
general k (1.8). furthermore, if it is assumed that the boundary term in the

6some indirect arguments corroborate the validity of this theorem [27, 28, 29].

7

index is again given by the free propagation of identical d-particles of any charge
less than k = mn then the total index is equal to one as expected.

in section 8 we turn to consider the eect of the higher derivative terms
on the conjectured equivalence of type iib string theory in ads5  s5 (ve-
dimensional anti de sitter space s5) and four-dimensional n = 4 supersym-
metric su (n ) yangmills theory on the boundary of ads5 (with the s5 ap-
pended). according to this correspondence [34] (see also [35, 36]) the higher-
derivative interactions of order 1 in the type iib theory should correspond to
contributions of correlation functions of composite operators in the yangmills
theory of order n 3/2 relative to the leading terms. this leads to a prediction of
the precise form of the yangmills instanton contributions to classes of correla-
tion functions that may be obtained from the protected supergravity processes.
these exact expressions exhibit the montonenolive duality sl(2, zz) symme-
try [37, 38] that is inherited from the supergravity interaction terms discussed
in the earlier sections.

section 9 will focus on the correspondence between the d-instanton contri-
butions to iib supergravity in ads5 s5 and the contribution of yangmills in-
stantons in the boundary supersymmetric yangmills theory. the d-instanton
is the stringy version of a classical solution to type iib supergravity that is con-
centrated around a point in euclidean ten-dimensional space. in the einstein
frame this solution is one in which the metric is at and 2e = 0 and the bps
condition relates the euclidean continuation of c(0) to e.
we will illustrate the ads/cft correspondence by comparing the one-
instanton contribution to the sixteen-dilatino amplitude in three dierent ways.
firstly (method (a)), we will extract the leading one d-instanton term in
f (12,12) which is the coecient of the sixteen-dilatino vertex. the amplitude
with specied boundary data is obtained by contracting each leg of this vertex
with a dilatino propagator from the vertex to a point on the boundary and inte-
grating the position of the vertex in the bulk ads5  s5 space. the ads/cft
correspondence identies the boundary value of the dilatino as the source of a
particular fermionic supercurrent of the n = 4 yangmills theory. it is there-
fore of interest to compare the sixteen-dilatino amplitude with the correlation
function of sixteen of these supercurrents. the second method (method (b))
is the direct determination of the leading one-instanton term in this correlator
in su (2) n = 4 yangmills theory which we will see has the same form as
the supergravity amplitude determined by method (a), up to an undetermined
overall coecient. the third method (method (c)), based on the semiclassical
approximation to scattering in a d-instanton background, again gives the same
expression. the agreement between the functional form of the correlators in
su (2) yangmills and the bulk amplitudes in iib supergravity might appear

8

somewhat surprising since the ads/cft correspondence is supposed to relate
the leading  piece of the r4 term to the large-n limit of su (n ) yangmills,
rather than to the n = 2 case. however, recent work on the large-n limit
of the one-instanton contributions of the yangmills theory [39] shows that all
the n -dependence enters in the overall coecients of these correlation functions
and their functional form is independent of n , thus explaining the agreement
for n = 2. furthermore, this overall coecient has the predicted n -dependence
for large n . this impressive agreement extends to the behaviour of the charge-
k d-instanton contribution [40, 41] to leading order in the coupling constant.
this will also be described (with few details) in section 9.

the einsteinhilbert action of the eleven-dimensional theory has the form,

where the overall normalization has been expressed in terms of the coupling

terms in the fully supersymmetric classical action of [4] involve the three-form
potential, c(3), and the gravitino,  (,  = 0, 1, . . . , 9, 11).

and the curvature in (2.5) is expressed in the string metric. the overall coe-

conventions the tension in a dp-brane is given by

10)1 where 2

and so the tension of the d-string (p = 1) is ea

the masses of the kaluzaklein modes of compactied m theory and the masses
of the type iia d-particles (p = 0 in (2.7)) leads to the relation between the

which expresses the eleven-dimensional planck scale in terms of the string scale

we will now generalize this description and obtain more insight by making
use of the fact that in the nine-dimensional theory the sl(2, zz) symmetry of
the iib string theory can be interpreted as a geometric symmetry of m-theory
compactied on a torus [2, 3]. three scalar elds arise from the compactication
of the eleven-dimensional theory (with coordinates labelled x0, . . . , x9, x11) on
a two-torus, t 2, oriented in the (x9, x11) directions so that g2

with a, b, c, d  zz and ad  bc = 1.

the type iib einsteinhilbert action is obtained by compactication of the

type iib expression (now in the type iib string frame),

where gb
 denotes the iib string metric. supersymmetry determines the re-
maining terms in the complete classical action in any of these parameterizations,
subject to the caveat that the iib theory does not have a globally well-dened
action because of the special features of self-dual antisymmetric tensor elds
[43, 44]. it follows from simple dimensional analysis that all the terms that only
involve bosonic elds have two derivatives. a pair of fermionic elds is dimen-
sionally equivalent to a derivative on a bosonic eld, so there are terms with
two fermion elds and a single derivative as well as terms with four fermionic
elds and no derivatives.

in the following we will be concerned with higher-derivative corrections to
the lowest-order action that necessarily arise in the quantum theory. certain of
these terms are known from tree-level and one-loop string perturbation theory.
for example, the exact expression for the four-graviton scattering amplitude
in either of the type ii superstring theories has a simple expansion in powers

and the eighth-rank tensor t8 arises in open superstring amplitudes and is de-
ned in [46]. the factor, k, is eighth-order in the external momenta and is the
linearized approximation to r4. the leading term in the expansion of the am-
plitude in powers of  in (a.1) summarizes the sum of the tree-level feynman
diagrams for on-shell four-graviton scattering in either of the ten-dimensional
low energy type ii supergravity theories. this consists of the sum of pole terms
together with a four-graviton contact interaction with two derivatives that arise
from the einsteinhilbert term. the next term, with coecient (3) is a contact
interaction with eight powers of momenta (contained in k) that arises from the
r4 term (which was deduced in this manner in [47] and from a four-loop sigma
model term in [48]). the one-loop contribution to the four-graviton amplitude
has coecient k with no dilaton dependence8.
it does not possess massless
particle poles and its leading low energy contribution is also to the r4 term
[45]. the eect of the tree-level r4 term on calabiyau compactications has
recently been reconsidered in [49, 50] and its eect on black hole solutions in
ads5  s5 has been analyzed in [51] and [52].
after compactication to nine dimensions on a circle of radius ra in the iia
units (or rb = 1/ra in the iib units) the one-loop term gets a simple 1/r2
a
(or 1/r2
b) correction due to the winding of the string around the compact tenth
dimension. putting these terms together with the appropriate coecients leads
to the expressions for the nine-dimensional r4 term in coordinates appropriate
to the type iia, iib or m-theory parameterizations [12],

the winding term of one of the type ii theories (e.g., the 22/3r2

rst expression) is interchanged with the nonwinding term of the other (e.g.,
the 22/3 term in the second expression).

= e2i b

the ellipsis in (2.19) indicate other terms that are yet to be determined. as
we will see there are in fact no further perturbative terms (higher inverse pow-
ers of 2) but there will be exponentially suppressed terms that are powers of
e2i a
= e2i. such contributions are associated with d-instantons.
generally, a dp-brane is a stringy soliton extended in p  0 spatial directions
while the d-instanton corresponds to the value p = 1 and is associated with a
point-like space-time event rather like a small yangmills instanton. the classi-
cal d-instanton is a solution of euclidean type iib supergravity in which eb
and
c(0) have nontrivial proles while the other elds (including the einstein-frame
metric) are trivial [53]. the action for a d-instanton with charge k is 2|k|/g,
where g is the asymptotic value of  1
so that the d-instanton contributions in
(2.19) should be characterized by terms proportional to

2

e2(|k|/gikc (0)),

(2.20)

where the  sign refers to a d-instanton and + to an anti d-instanton. this
classical conguration will be reviewed in section 9 where we will also see a direct
correspondence between yangmills instantons and d-instantons in the context
of the ads/cft conjecture. string scattering amplitudes in a d-instanton
background are described by world-sheets with boundaries on which the target-
space coordinates satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions [54, 55, 11]. such point-
like closed string boundary conditions have a signicant short distance eect on
string scattering amplitudes  a fact that led to the suggestion [56] that they
may be relevant in the formulation of a string theory of hadrons.

an explicit calculation of the leading eect of a single d-instanton was car-
ried out in [11] by considering four-graviton scattering in the presence of dirich-
let world-sheet boundaries. this established the presence of the charge-one
d-instanton term in the ten-dimensional type iib eective action that arises in
the rb   limit of siib
r4 . however, in order to ensure the sl(2, zz) duality
invariance of the eective action the expressions in (2.19), there must be an
innite number of terms with d-instantons of arbitrarily high charge. in order
to exhibit this modular invariance it is instructive to write the last line of (2.19)
in terms of the complex structure as

we have here identied the expression in parentheses with the expansion of
an as yet undetermined function, f (0,0)(, ), that must transform as a scalar
under sl(2, zz) transformations of the complex structure, . this translates
into a function f (0,0)( b,  b) in the iib theory and f (0,0)( a,  a) in the iia

for example, in [57]). the overall normalization in (2.22) has been chosen so

. this coincides with the tree-level
expression in parentheses in the second line of (2.19) (after allowing for the extra
factor of  1/2
due to the transformation between the string frame and einstein
frame). this expression for f (0,0) was further motivated by the study of the
one-loop corrections to eleven-dimensional supergravity on t 2 [16] (see section
5) and will be derived from supersymmetry in section 4.

in the meantime it is worth noting that the perturbative contributions to the
decompactication limits that give the ten-dimensional type iia theories and
eleven-dimensional m-theory are easily obtained from (2.19) and (2.21). in the
ten-dimensional iia limit, ra   in the rst line in (2.19), the d-instanton
 i, so e2i a
terms vanish exponentially since  a  iraea
 0 in this
limit. this leaves only the perturbative terms. if we now consider the further
decompactication to eleven dimensions ea
11   the tree-level iia
contribution vanishes and the one-loop term gives a nite contribution. this
eleven-dimensional limit coincides with the limit v   in (2.21). in this limit
the v 1/2 term vanishes and the nite eleven-dimensional term comes entirely
from the term pr oportional to v. it is important to note if there had been
= r3/2
other terms of higher order in the type iia coupling constant, ea
11 ,
the eleven-dimensional limit would have been singular order by order in iia
perturbation theory and the limit would not have been uniform. however, if
f (0,0) is given by the expression (2.22) there are no further perturbative terms
and the eleven-dimensional limit is simply

as argued in [12] the coecient of this term is in precise agreement with super-
symmetry which relates the r4 term to the eleven-form c(3)  x8.

3 linearized supersymmetry and higher deriva-

tive terms

the existence of a large number of interactions in the iib theory that are of the
same dimension as the r4 interaction can be motivated very simply by using
linearized supersymmetry. this can be implemented by packaging the physical
elds or their eld strengths into a constrained supereld (xi, ) where
a (a = 1, . . . , 16) is a complex grassmann coordinate that transforms as a weyl
spinor of so(9, 1). this supereld is taken to satisfy the holomorphic condition
[13],

and the constraints,

(3.4)

the constraints (3.1) and (3.2) ensure that the eld  has an expansion in

elds in an on-shell supermultiplet 9,

although the linearized theory cannot capture the full structure of the terms
in the eective action it can be used to relate various terms in the limit of weak
coupling, im 0 = g1   (where g = e0 is the string coupling constant).
the linearized approximations to the complete interactions are those that arise
by integrating a function of  over the sixteen components of ,

using the expression for  in (3.5) and substituting into (3.8) leads to all the
possible interactions at this order in  [14, 25],

s(3) = z d10x det e (cid:16)f (12,12)16 + f (11,11) g14 + . . .
+f (8,8) g8 + . . . + f (0,0)r4 + . . . + f (12,12) 16(cid:17) ,

where det e = det em

 is the determinant of the zehnbein.

(3.10)

the r4 interaction comes from the 4 term while the 16 comes from the
16 term. we see, in particular, that the tensor structure of the contractions
between the four riemann tensors in the r4 term is summarized by the grass-
mann integration [60],

where

r4 =z d16(r4)4,

r4   

 r .

(3.11)

(3.12)

it follows from a standard fierz transformation that all possible contractions of
the riemann tensor appearing in r4 vanish, so that only the trace-free part 
the weyl tensor  survives.

the superscripts that label the coecients f (w,w) are related to the viola-
tion of the u (1) charge. thus, the linearized form of the general term in (3.10)
contains a product of p elds,

z d10x det e f (w,w)

p

which violates the u (1) charge by

(3.13)

units, where we have used (3.7) and the fact that the total power of  must be

the 16 term (w = 12) violates the u (1) charge by 24 and there are many other
terms that violate the charge by any even number.

pk rk = 16. for example the r4 term (w = 0) conserves the u (1) charge while
in the linearized approximation, g  0 (2  ), the coecients f (w,w)
are constants that are related to each other by use of the taylor expansion,
2f while the 16 term has
(3.9). for example, the r4 term has coecient 4
coecient 16

2 f so that, at the linearized level,

f (12,12) (cid:18)2



2(cid:19)12

f (0,0),

17

(3.15)

where for the moment we are not concerned about the overall constant.
in
writing this we have used the fact that the linearized approximation is valid
only if the inhomogeneous term in the modular covariant derivative, d (dened
in appendix b), is negligible which requires that

220f (w,w) >> wf (w,w)

(3.16)

since only in this case does the modular covariant derivative reduce to the
ordinary derivative. this inequality is obviously not satised by terms in the
expansion of f (w,w) that are powers of 2, such as the perturbative tree and
one-loop terms in (2.19) (with 2  0). however, when acting on a factor such
as  n
0 e2|k|0 (where n is any constant) which is characteristic of a charge-k
d-instanton, the inhomogeneous term may be neglected in the limit 0   and
the covariant derivative linearizes. therefore, a linearized superspace expression
such as (3.8) should contain the exact leading multi-instanton contributions to
the r4 and related terms. these leading instanton terms arise by substituting
the expression
(3.17)

fk = cke2i|k|

into (3.8).

in the exact theory that will be considered in detail in the next section,
the sl(2, zz) symmetry of the iib theory requires that the f (w,w)(,  ) are
modular forms with holomorphic and anti-holomorphic weights as indicated in
the superscripts. in that case the derivative 00 in (3.15) will be replaced by
the covariant derivative, dw, that maps a modular form of weight (w, w) into a
modular form of weight (w + 1, w  1)10,

the covariant version of (3.15) is

f (12,12)(,  ) = d12f (0,0)(,  )

 d11d10 . . . d0f (0,0)(,  ).

(3.19)

we will take this relation to dene the relative normalizations of f (0,0) and
f (12,12).

4 nonlinear

supersymmetry constraints on

terms of order 1

in this section, which is based on [15] where further details may be found, the
constraints imposed by the full nonlinear supersymmetry of the type iib theory
will be used to derive the detailed expressions for all the terms in s(3)  the
terms in the derivative expansion of the action of the type iib theory that are
of order 1.

the procedure will be to impose supersymmetry order by order in  by
expressing the supersymmetry transformations on an arbitrary eld  as the
series,

 =(cid:16)(0) + (1) + . . . + n(n) + . . .(cid:17) ,

(4.1)

while the eective action has the expansion (1.1). in principle, the action can
be constructed by imposing the conditions,

  r
xm=0

m(m)! r
xn=o

ns(n) = 0,

(4.2)

order by order in . in addition, it is important to impose closure of the super-
symmetry algebra on all the elds. in theories of this type the supersymmetry
algebra only closes on a eld  up to the equations of motion and also includes
specic local symmetry transf ormations, local. the generic structure of the
superalgebra is therefore of the form,

(12  21) = d +  equations of motion + local,

(4.3)

where the rst term is the usual translation term with parameter

 = 2 im 21.

(4.4)

imposing the supersymmetry conditions (4.2) together with closure of the
superalgebra (4.3) simultaneously determines both the action and the super-
symmetry transformations on the elds. the 0 (n = m = 0) term in (4.2)
corresponds to the supersymmetry of the classical theory. these terms in the
action and in the supersymmetry transformations were determined in [59], ig-
noring terms that are quartic in fermion elds11. some of these zeroth order
supersymmetry transformations and action are reviewed in appendix c. one
particular term quartic in the fermion elds is needed in the following (the term
l(0)

1 below) with a coecient that is derived in [15].
11as stated in the introduction, it is really the equations of motion rather than the action

that will be considered in the following.

19

there are no n = 1 or n = 2 terms at tree-level or one-loop, and there is
strong evidence that supersymmetry precludes the presence of any such terms
in (1.1). we will assume this to be the case so that the rst corrections are the
terms in s(3), which are of order ()3 relative to s(0). these terms are eighth
order in derivatives.

the procedure of imposing supersymmetry and closure can become very
complicated unless one makes a judicious choice of starting point. we will start
by selecting two special terms in l(3) that involve sixteen fermionic elds12. the
choice is motivated by the fact that these two terms mix with each other and
with no other terms under the classical supersymmetry transformations. the
two terms are the sixteen-fermion terms contained in

l(3)

where the ellipsis represents other terms in g which do not aect the subsequent
argument13 (details of the spinor algebra that leads to the precise coecients
in this and following equations can be found in appendix c and [15]).

from the lowest order supersymmetry transformations given in appendix c

we obtain terms that transform (4.5) into det e 16

1 = i det e (cid:0)

(cid:1) 16 (cid:16)8f (12,12) + 6  144 d11f (11,11)(cid:17) ,

where we have only kept terms proportional to 16 
 . it is important to check
whether there could also be a contribution of the same form as (4.6) arising from
a ()3(3) variation of the elds in the lowest order action s(0). however, it is
easy to see by inspection that no term with 16
 can arise from the variation of
any term in s(0). this means that we must require (0)
1 = 0, which implies
that

1 l(3)

(4.6)

d11f (11,11) =

3  144

f (12,12).

(4.7)

this condition is consistent with the modular weights assigned to the functions
f (w,w).

we now consider the term in the variation of (4.5) that is proportional to

det e 16  ,

where we have made explicit only the terms containing 16. in this case,
there is another contribution of the same form as (0)
that arises from the
()3(3) variation of terms in the lowest order iib lagrangian l(0). even
though the complete set of interactions in the classical theory is not tabulated
explicitly in the literature (it is implicit in the superspace formulation [13]), it is
2 l(3)
easy to convince oneself that the only possible term that can vary into (0)
is a term of the form,

2 l(3)

(4.9)

which is the unique tensor structure containing 22. the coecient of this
term was determined by the lowest order supersymmetry transformations in [15]
by considering the mixing of l(0)

1 with other terms in the classical action.

we see that l(0)

can vary into the same form as (0)

if we assume a

(4.11)

comparing with (4.8) we see that in order for the total contribution to l1 to
vanish at order ()3, there must be a linear relation between the function g
and the functions f (11,11) and d12f (12,12),

d12f (12,12) + 3  144 

15
2

f (11,11) + 15 g = 0.

(4.12)

at this stage we have two equations ((4.7) and (4.12)) relating the three
unknown functions, f (12,12), f (11,11) and g. a further constraint on these
functions is obtained by requiring the closure of the superalgebra. we need to
consider closure of the supersymmetry transformations on the eld . first, in
the classical theory (and keeping only the terms linear in  derivatives) it was
found in eq. (4.5) of [59] that

this has the form of (4.3). the rst term on the right-hand-side is of the form
expected for the commutator of two supersymmetry transformations. the other
terms that have been exhibted explicitely are proportional to the linear terms in
the  equation of motion. many other terms that are not needed are indicated
by . . .. these terms contribute to the commutator to complete the low-energy
 eld equation as well as generating local transformations of  [59].

the higher order terms in l(3) modify the equations of motion and this
should also be apparent by considering the closure of the algebra. therefore,
we now consider terms that enter at order 3 from the commutator of a (0)
with a (3). more precisely, we shall consider terms in the commutator involving
only

which is to be identied with a supersymmetry transformation of the form (4.10)

combining (4.13) and (4.14) (including the powers of ) we see that in order
for the right-hand side of the commutator to vanish the  eld equation must
be of the form,

id  ()3 32 d11g 15 + . . . = 0,

(4.15)

where the ellipsis indicates terms with dierent structure that we have not

id  ()3f (12,12) 15 + . . . = 0,

(4.16)

where we have only made explicit the term that is proportional to 15. com-
paring (4.15) and (4.16) gives the relation,

(4.23)

where k is an irrelevant constant. therefore, from (3.19), we can make the
identication

f (0,0) = k1f (0,0).

it is an important fact that we will not prove here (see, for example, exercise 2

assumed to transform as a scalar under sl(2, zz) and has polynomial growth as

expressions for all the coecients, f (w,w), in (3.10) should also emerge from
a more detailed application of the noether procedure that considers all the

this transforms under sl(2, zz) transformations by a phase

the noether procedure rapidly escalates in complication when applied at
higher orders in the derivative expansion and it is probably not a practical
procedure for terms with many more derivatives. it may just about be feasible
to deduce terms of order  that are of order 5 beyond the einsteinhilbert
term. for example, this may be a method of determining the higher derivative
terms suggested in [26] which were motivated by exactly known perturbative
contributions [61, 62].

the dimensions of the terms of yet higher order in  suggested in [22, 26] are
so high that it is not obvious why they should be protected by supersymmetry.
nevertheless, they probably are protected based on the evidence for the exact
form of these terms presented in these references.

there is also a suggestion [17, 63] for how the structure of the protected
o(1) terms generalizes to compactications to lower dimensions, where there
are more moduli. the suggestion is that the functions f (w,w) are generalized
eisenstein series for the appropriate du ality groups.

5 the eleven-dimensional perspective

we shall now review the manner in which the o(1) terms in the type ii
string actions can be deduced from eleven-dimensional supergravity. this was
the subject of [16] where it was pointed out that the complete r4 term arises
from the one-loop quantum contribution to four-graviton scattering in eleven-
dimensional supergravity compactied on t 2. similarly, the 16 interaction

24

can be deduced from the one-loop scattering amplitude of sixteen gravitini in
eleven-dimensional supergravity [14]. the type iib dilatino, , is identied
with the gravitino of eleven-dimensional supergravity with its polarizations in
appropriate directions. these calculations and generalizations were reviewed in
[64] where some further details may be found, including a discussion of higher
derivative contributions (which were also the subject of [22]).

5.1 the r4 term from one loop in eleven dimensions
we will begin with the r4 term which will be determined from the scattering
amplitude for four gravitons at one loop in eleven-dimensional supergravity
[16]. a fully covariant calculation would involve the sum of loop diagrams with
the various component elds (the graviton, g, the third-rank antisymmetric
potential, c(3)
) and their ghosts circulating around
the loop. an ecient method for summing all these contributions is to use
a manifestly supersymmetric formalism based on the eleven-dimensional point
particle [16] (details of the superparticle formalism outlined below have yet to
appear [65]).

 , and the gravitino, a

this method is modeled on the method used to construct string one-loop

amplitudes in the light-cone gauge which is the parameterization in which

x +(t) = p+t + x+,

(5.1)

where t labels the world-line of the superparticle, x (t) = (x 0(t)  x 8(t))/2

and p+ is a constant (the directions x9, x11 will continue to be the t 2 directions).
the physical states are described in terms of the transverse so(9) representa-
tions (instead of the so(8) that is relevant for the transverse space in the case
of the superstring). the quantum states are constructed in terms of fermionic
sixteen-component spinors, sa (a = 1, . . . , 16), satisfying the anticommutation
relations,
(5.2)

{sa, sb} = ab.

the 32 components of the supercharges decompose the components that are
realized linearly in the light-cone gauge,

and those that are nonlinearly realized,

qa = p+sa,

qa =

1
p+ ( 

x s)a,

(5.3)

(5.4)

where i
coordinates of the superparticle.

ab are the 16 16 so(9) gamma matrices and x i(t) are the transverse

25

the vertex operators that describe the linearized interactions can be derived
by imposing the conditions that the g,  and c(3) vertices transform into each
other under supersymmetry in the appropriate manner [65] which mimics the
way in which light-cone superstring vertices can be derived. the resulting light-
cone graviton vertex operator is given by

g = (r)
v (r)

ij ( x i x j  2 x isjlskl + 2silsklsjm skm )eikx ,

(5.5)

where, as usual in the light-cone gauge operator formalism, a special frame has
been chosen in which k+ = 0 and (r)
ij is the transverse polarization tensor of the
eleven-dimensional graviton (i = 1, , 7, 9, 11). this expression reduces to the
graviton vertex in the type iia superparticle theory when reduced on a circle
to ten dimensions [65]. in addition to the cubic graviton vertex higher-order
contact interactions are necessary in order to reproduce general gauge-invariant
amplitudes. such contact terms compensate for short distance singularities in
products of v (r)
s that involve factors such as h x( ) x( )i but are not needed
for the amplitudes we are interested in.

(5.6)

where trs denotes the trace over the fermionic variables. the integers m, n are
the kaluzaklein charges in the t 2 directions (x9, x11). for convenience we will
only consider the situation in which all the external polarizations and momenta
are oriented in the directions x1, . . . , x7 which are transverse to the light-cone
as well as the t 2 directions. the fermionic trace is saturated by the term with
sixteen s factors, which picks out the last term in (5.5) (the term with four ss)
xs in the prefactor of the vertices. this picks out an
so that no contractions of
overall kinematic factor which can be shown to be the same as the overall factor
in the ten-dimensional one-loop superstring amplitude dened in (2.18) and
can be expressed in a compact manner as an integral over a sixteen-component
grassmann spinor, as described in section 3.

after extracting the overall kinematic factor the remaining bosonic factor is
simply the loop amplitude for the four-point amplitude in scalar 3 eld theory.
the full momentum dependence of this amplitude was discussed in [22, 64].
expanding in a power series in the momenta leads to higher derivatives acting
on the fourth power of the curvature. however, here we are only interested in
the leading momentum dependence. therefore, after extracting the kinematic
factor the external momenta can be set equal to zero in the remainder of the

26

expression. the result can be written as

ar4 =

for the inverse metric,

gij lilj =

|m + n|2

v

,

(5.8)

and performing a double poisson resummation converts the sum over kaluza
klein charges (m, n) to a sum over the windings ( m, n) of the world-line of the
particle circulating in the loop around the two independent cycles of t 2. after
the straightforward gaussian integration the result is

(2)1/2 + (cid:21)(cid:27) ,

where t = t1. the cubic ultraviolet divergence in (5.9) is contained in the
zero winding term, m = n = 0, which has the divergent coecient c. the
second equality in (5.9) gives the rst two terms in the expansion for large 2
(this expansion will be discussed in detail in section 6). the amplitude (5.9)
comes from a term in the eective action of the form (2.21) with f (0,0) again
of the form (2.22). as remarked earlier, in the limit v  0 the regularized vc
term vanishes and the amplitude has a nite limit in type iib coordinates, i.e.,
rb   with eb
held constant. substituting  by  = c(0) + ie leads to
precisely the same expression for the r4 term in the type iib theory that we
deduced earlier from supersymmetry.
it is easy to argue on dimensional grounds that the nite part of the co-
ecient of the r4 term can only come from one loop in eleven dimensions.
higher loops lead to nite contributions that have extra derivatives acting on
r4 [64]. however, the systematics of the divergent parts is more obscure and
the coecient c has contributions from divergences of diagrams with arbitrary
numbers of loops. these divergences must be regularized by microscopic eects
in the eleven-dimensional theory that lie outside the realm of perturbation the-
ory. although we do not know how to x the regularized value of c directly
it is precisely determined by symmetry considerations. keeping v nonzero and

27

comparing the leading terms of the large-2 expansion in (5.9) with (2.21) shows
that these expressions only agree if c has the value

c =

22
3

.

(5.10)

we saw that the coecients in (2.21) are consistent with t-duality that relates
the iia and iib string perturbation expansions in nine dimensions. this means
that only for the value of c in (5.10) is (5.9) consistent with t-duality. this
leads to the same value of c as the argument based on supersymmetry that was
mentioned at the end of section 2.

5.2 one loop with sixteen dilatini

in a similar manner all the interactions that are related by linearized super-
symmetry to the r4 term can be deduced by considering one-loop processes in
eleven-dimensional supergravity on t 2 [14]. as we saw in section 3 the generic
terms of this type violate the u (1) r-symmetry charge of the type iib theory
that is conserved classically. an extreme example of this is the interaction be-
tween sixteen dilatini. since the dilatino  carries a u (1) charge of 3/2 the inte
raction 16 violates 24 units of charge.

as in the case of four-graviton scattering the calculation of the general loop
amplitude that describes the scattering of sixteen external dilatini is facilitated
by using the light-cone superspace description of the eleven-dimensional super-
particle. however, the 16 term of interest can be extracted from the zero-
momentum process and this can be calculated without using the general grav-
itino vertex operators. the zero-momentum loop amplitude has the structure
(ignoring an overall constant)

a16 =

v xm,nz d9pz d



 16trs(v (1)

 (0) v (16)



(0))e (p2+ 1

v2

|m+n|2),

(5.11)
where v (r)
 (0) is the zero-momentum vertex for the  component of the rth
gravitino. the trace in the above expression is over the fermionic operators in
the vertices.

the fermions of the iib theory compactied on s1, the complex elds  and
, are related to specic projections of the eleven-dimensional gravitino of m
theory on t 2. these relations are described in appendix d (based on [14]). it
follows that the vertex v is a specic projection of the vertex operator for the
eleven-dimensional gravitino, v. the gravitino vertex can again be deduced
from eleven-dimensional supersymmetry in the light-cone gauge [14]. the zero-

28

momentum vertex is very simply expressed in terms of the 32-component eleven-
dimensional supercharge, q, by the covariant expression

v = 

qp,

(5.12)

where  is the zero-momentum wave function, p is the momentum of the par-
ticle circulating around the loop and 
  0 (with no complex conjugation).
since the zero momentum vertex is independent of the proper time around the
loop the volume of integration over the proper times of the vertices gives the
factor of  16 in (5.11).

we now want to consider the components of  containing . inverting the

relations in equation (d.12) in appendix d gives,

z = pzz + pzz,

z = pzz + pzz.

(5.13)

from which it follows that

v = zpzqpz = zqpz,

(5.14)

where q = pzq is a projected supercharge that satises the anticommutation
relations

z

z pz.

{qa, qb} = p ac

z p bd

{qc, qd} = ab

(5.15)
the momentum dependence can be scaled out by changing to qa = qa(pz) 1
2 ,
which satises {qa, qb} = ab
z  ab
and the commutation relation does not depend on z.
substituting the vertex (5.14) into the loop amplitude (5.11) (contact terms
2 process) and integrating over the loop mo-

. in the chirally projected subspace ab

are again not needed in this spin- 1
mentum gives an expression of the form

z

va16 = kv  1

2 f (12,12)(, ),

where the kinematic prefactor,

k = (1)
a1

 (16)

a16

tr(qa1  qa16 ),

(5.16)

(5.17)

is manifestly antisymmetric under permutations of the (commuting) fermion
wave functions due to the anticyclic property of the trace. it can be rewritten
(up to an overall constant) as

k = 

a1  

a16 a1...a16

16

(5.18)

where 16 is the rank sixteen epsilon tensor with spinor indices.

29

the rest of the expression (5.16) depends on the circumference rb through

2|m + n|2(cid:19)

(5.19)

(where c is an overall constant). this expression is supercially cubically diver-
gent due to the sum over the kaluza-klein charges. however, this does not take
into account the phase dependence which, for generic , can lead to a cancel-
lation between the growing terms in the sum. indeed, for asymptotically large
m and n the sum over discrete momenta pz and pz can be replaced by integrals
and the result is proportional to

z dpzdpzp24

z (pzpz)23/2,

(5.20)

which vanishes if |pz| is regularized. equivalently, it vanishes if the phase inte-
gration is carried out before the integration over |pz|. this is the regularization
prescription that will be used in the following, motivated by the fact that it
leads to an sl(2, zz) invariant answer.

in order to extract the nite result it is useful, as before, to use a double
poisson summation to transform from the discrete momentum sum to a sum
over windings of the loop around the torus. writing

where m and n are winding numbers.

after translating from the m-theory coordinates (, v) to the string-frame
iib coordinates ( , rb) the expression (5.22) is identical to (4.26) up to an overall

30

normalization that can be absorbed in c. the amplitude a16 corresponds to
the 16 term in the iib eective action, (3.10), in the limit, rb  , of ten
decompactied dimensions. in fact, in this case there is no divergent term at
all even at nite rb. the eleven-dimensional limit of a16 is not only nite but
it vanishes. the nine-dimensional eective action in the iib parameterization
contains the term

s(3)
16 =

3  (4)7ls z d9x rb det e e/2 16f (12,12)(,  ).

(5.23)

this expression has been written in the string frame. the transformation from
einstein frame to string frame includes the rescaling   e/8 in addition to
the rescaling of the zehnbein, ea

  ea

e/4.

6 fourier series and properties of d-instantons

we have seen that the terms in the ten-dimensional type iib eective action of
order 1 have the form (in string frame) [66],

1

 z d10x det e e/2f (w,w)(,  )o{ur },

(6.1)

where o{ur} is a function of the elds that reduces, at the linearized level to a
monomial of p elds with u (1) r-symmetry charges u1, u2, . . . up (see (3.13)).
the total u (1) charge of the interaction is 2w where w = p  4 (see (3.14))
and the coecient f (w,w) is given by (4.27). the coecient functions can be
expressed as fourier series,

f (w,w) =



xk=

fk,w e2ik1,

(6.2)

where the fourier coecients, fk,w, with nonzero k are the d-instanton terms
when k > 0 and anti d-instanton terms when k < 0. this expansion is readily
derived by a generalization of the method that leads to the analogous expansion
of the eisenstein series, es (see, for example, [57]). first one performs the sum
over all the terms in (4.27) with n = 0 and m 6= 0. this leads to the tree-level
term of the form 2(3)e2. for the terms with n 6= 0 one may perform a
poisson resummation that converts the sum over m into a sum over a conjugate
integer, m. the sum over all n 6= 0 with m = 0 gives the one-loop term that
is independent of 2 while the remaining sum (over all n 6= 0, m 6= 0) gives the
d-instanton contributions with k = m n.

(6.8)

where the asymptotic expansion of the bessel function k1(2|k|2) (which is
useful for small coupling, or large 2) has been used in the second equality.

the expressions (6.3) and (6.8) reproduce precisely the perturbative tree-
level and one-loop terms and demonstrate that there is a perturbative non-
renormalization theorem beyond one loop. the absence of higher-order pertur-
bative corrections must be related to the fact that the terms in (6.1) are given
by integrals over half the on-shell superspace although a direct proof of the

32

absence of higher-order perturbative corrections has not been given (see how-
ever [28]). the non-perturbative terms in (6.8) are contributions of d-instantons
(and anti-d-instantons) of arbitrary charge k together with an innite sequence
of perturbative uctuations around each instanton conguration.

the d-instanton sum has a simple origin from the point of view of the
loop integrals considered in section 5. there, the circulating particle can be
considered to be a kaluzaklein mode of charge n of m theory compactied on
the rst circle of circumference r11. for n 6= 0 this is a charge-n d-particle. the
world-line of this d-particle winds m times around the second circle of radius
ra (in iia string units). the action for such a conguration is given by the
diracborninfeld action for the d-particle and is equal to

2| mn|(raea

 ic(1))

(6.9)

(where the  distinguishes instantons and anti-instantons). after performing a
t-duality on the euclidean circle [11] the real part of this expression is identied
with the charge-k d-instanton action,

sk= mn = 2|k|eb

(6.10)

from (6.5) we see that the leading contribution to the n d-instanton con-

and the r  r potential c(1) is identied with c(0).

(6.11)

where p = w + 4 and we have factored out the measure factor zk (6.7), which
depends on k but not on sk and is normalized so that z1 = 1. the power
7/2 in (6.11) arises from the combination of ten bosonic zero modes and sixteen
fermionic zero modes while the factor of sk for each external state comes from
the normalization of the external states.

7 d-particle bound states and the witten index

one of the central planks of the web of dualities that relate string theory and
m theory is the identication of d-particles (d0-branes) of type iia superstring
theory with kaluzaklein modes of eleven-dimensional supergravity compact-
ied on s1 [1]. there is a single kaluzaklein mode of a given charge, n ,
with mass n times the mass of charge-one d-particle. this implies that there
must be precisely one threshold bound state (a bound state with zero binding
energy) of n d-particles. the interaction of n d-particles is described by the

33

one-dimensional matrix model  a quantum mechanical system that is iso-
morphic to the dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional u (n ) supersymmetric
yang-mills theory to one (time) dimension [30].
it is notoriously dicult to
analyze the possible threshold bound states of this theory. one approach used
in [32, 33] in the case n = 2 is to demonstrate that the witten index is equal to
one. this shows that there is at least one bound state. here we will show how
the results of the last section indicate that the witten index is equal to one for

7.1 d-particles and d-instantons

the witten index for the system of n d-particles was dened in [32, 33] by

i (n ) = z d9x lim

(7.2)

where the rst term denes a bulk contribution i (n )
bulk (which in general is not
an integer) and the second term a decit contribution i (n )
def (which corrects the
bulk term). the separation of the integer i (n ) into these two parts is dependent
on the order of limits. we shall always consider the innite volume limit to be
taken before the limit   0.

the trace in (7.2) is dened over gauge invariant states of the hilbert space,
which may be written as a trace over all states if a projector onto gauge invariant
states (states satisfying the constraints of gauss law, c|i = 0) is inserted. for
the bulk term this gives

i (n )

(7.3)

where a is the gauge parameter. using the heat kernel approximation for the
propagator in the hamiltonian h, which is valid in the limit   0, it was
observed in [32] and [33] that the exponent of the bulk part of the index can be
written in a so(10) invariant form. this is possible because the parameter 
turns into a tenth bosonic coordinate, x9.

the resulting integrals are seen to be equivalent to the su (n ) integral in
the partition function for the zero-dimensional matrix model. this is the model

14see [67] for a very dierent approach to the threshold bound state problem

34

that is obtained by compactication of supersymmetric yangmills theory from
ten (euclidean) dimensions to zero dimensions that describes dynamics in the
presence of n d-instantons [30, 68, 69]. the situation with d-instantons is some-
what distinct from that of other dp-branes since p = 1 and the world-volume
reduces to a space-time point. the conguration space of n d-instantons is
determined by bosonic and fermionic u (n ) matrices a and , where  and
 denote so(10) vector and spinor indices, respectively. the reduction of the
supersymmetric yangmills action to a point is given by

s =

tr([a, a ]2) +

tr( [a, ]).

(7.4)

the center of mass degrees of freedom are associated with the element of
the cartan subalgebra of u (n ) proportional to the unit matrix and do not
appear in the action (7.4). they do, however, enter as shift symmetries in the
supersymmetry transformations,

a = i,
 = [a, a ]  + 1 .

(7.5)

the sixteen-dimensional spinor  parameterizes the dimensionally reduced su-
persymmetry of the su (n ) ym theory and the spinor  acts as a constant shift
on the fermions in the center of mass degrees of freedom. hence the u(1)
part of u (n ) fermionic elds  plays the role of the sixteen fermionic collective
coordinates associated with the charge-n d-instanton.

after factoring out the centre of mass coordinates the n d-instanton parti-

tion function is given by

z =z d10yz d16 zn ,

(7.6)

where

zn =

1

v ol(su (n )/zn )zsu(n )

dda exp(ssy m [a, ]).

(7.7)

the integration over y and a is the integral over the overall bosonic and
fermionic collective coordinates of the collection of d-instantons of total charge
n . the integration measure in (7.7) is the group invariant haar measure which
denes the appropriate normalization (as discussed in [70, 71]). a non-zero
value for zn can only arise from congurations in which there are no ex-
tra fermionic zero modes (in addition to ) which is characteristic of a single
multiply-charged d-instanton. according to [30] the partition function of the
su(n) zero-dimensional matrix model should be identied with the d-instanton
measure, zn (6.7). the integral (7.7) was evaluated for the case n = 2 in

35

[32, 33]. the sub-integral over congurations in which the elements of the car-
tan subalgebra, a3
, 3, are xed was evaluated in [72] and corresponds to two
d-instantons at a xed separation. more recently, the integral has been ex-
plicitly evaluated for general n by deforming the integrand into a topological
density [73] and numerical estimates have been made in [70].

the fact that the integral (7.7) is the same as the bulk integral which ap-
pears in the calculation of the witten index in the bound state problem of
d-particles is the statement of t-duality. the radius  of the euclidean circle
in (7.3) shrinks to zero size and the insertion of (1)f enforces supersymmetric
(periodic) boundary conditions on the fermionic elds. the conjectured form
for the measure, zn given by (6.7) therefore suggests that the value of the bulk
integral is given, for arbitrary n , by

i (n )

bulk = xm|n

m2 = zn ,

(7.8)

where an overall constant has been xed by noting that i (1)
for n = 2 the value of i (2)
of [32, 33].

bulk = 1. note that
bulk = 5/4 in (7.8) agrees with the explicit calculation

7.2 the decit term

the appearance of a decit term is related to the presence of the boundary
terms in (7.2). for the su (2) case a heuristic evaluation of this term was given
in [32] and a more rigorous argument in [33].
it was argued that since the
boundary term for the system of two d-particles arises from the region in which
the particles are separated it is obtained by treating the particles as identical
free particles with moduli space r9/z2. since the witten index vanishes for
free particles the decit term, i (2)
def , must cancel the bulk term for the free
system, i (2)
0 def is
easily evaluated and is equal to 1/4. in the following [31] we shall assume that
this prescription generalizes to n > 2 d-particles so that, for prime values of
n ,

0 bulk, where the subscript 0 indicates the free theory. but i (2)

i (n )
def = i (n )
0 bulk,

(7.9)

0 bulk is the bulk index for n identical

where i (n )
free particles moving on
r9(n 1)/sn . for non-prime values, n = mn, the generalization will take into
account the regions of moduli space of m free charge-n particles on r9( m1)/s m.
in the n = 2 case considered in [32, 33] the only conguration that con-
tributed to the trace over the free two-particle states was one with an odd per-
mutation of the two particles. if the trace is expressed as a functional integral

36

this includes only congurations in which the two d-particles are described by
a single euclidean world-line that winds twice around the compact  direction.
in order to generalize this to arbitrary n we need to consider the action of sn ,
which is the weyl group of su (n ). this can be parameterized by matrices mab
acting on the positions of the n particles modded out by the overall translation
invariance, x i
a . the index a = 1, .., n  1
labels the dierent u (1)s in the cartan subalgebra. the action of an element
in sn is given by

a (i = 1, , 9), and the fermions 

(7.10)
where the vector index runs over i = 1, , 9 and the spinor index  = 1, 16.

the fermion elds  satisfy the following anticommutation relations,

where the vector and spinor indices are suppressed and the highest term has

the expression for the bulk contribution to the witten index for n free

d-particles (with n a prime) is given by

i (n )
0 bulk = lim
0

tr(1)f eh.

(7.14)

the trace is taken over gauge invariant states in the hilbert space and hence
one has to insert a projector on states which are invariant under the weyl
permutation group,

p =

1

n ! xsn

m.

(7.15)

the matrix m representing   sn act as in (7.10) on the coordinates xa and
the fermions a in the wave function  given in (7.13). the bulk index for the
free theory is therefore given by

i (n )
0 bulk = lim

(7.16)

37

the factor of (1)f counts bosons (even number of ) with +1 and fermions
(odd number of ) with 1. because the fermions transform under the sym-
metric group matrices m , the introduction of the projector p can give a non-
vanishing contribution.
the action of m on a and xa in (7.16) factorizes into a trace over the
hilbert space built from the fermionic creation operators and a bosonic gaussian
integral coming from the heat kernel approximation for the free propagator in
the limit   0 [32].

so that the trace over all eight fermion components gives a factor of det(1m)8.
the gaussian integration over the coordinates x i
a similarly gives a factor of
det(1  m)9
the determinant is easily evaluated by using an explicit representation for
the matrices m. recall that these represent the action of sn on the elements
of the cartan subalgebra. the roots of su (n ) are the vectors in rn ,

ei  ej,

i 6= j;

i, j = 1, , n,

(7.19)

where ei the ith unit vector of rn . all the roots lie in a (n  1)-dimensional
subspace r orthogonal to the vector  = e1 + e2 + + en = (1, 1, , 1) and
an element   sn acts as a permutation,  : ei  e(i).
two clases of permutations need to be distinguished:

(a)cyclic permutations
these can be represented up to conjugation by the n  n matrix

which has eigenvalues

n ,

k = 0, 1, , n  1.

(7.21)

the matrix mc does not leave any of the roots (7.19) invariant and  is the
unique eigenvector with eigenvalue 0 = 1. we are interested in evaluating
det(1  m) = det(1  mc), where the prime indicates the omission of the zero
eigenvalue. this is the determinant in the space orthogonal to  and is given
by the product of non-zero eigenvalues,

n 1

det(1  mc) =

yk=1

(1  k) = 2n 1

(7.22)

(b) non-cyclic permutations
these can be represented by

mnc =

0
0 m2


0
0

0
0

0


0

0


 mp




(7.23)

where m1, m2, , mp, represent cyclic permutations of subsets of elements
and can be written in the form of (7.20). the matrix mnc has p > 1 unit
eigenvalues so there are p  1 eigenvectors wj  r for which (1  mnc)wj = 0
(j = 1, , p  1). as a result, some elements of the cartan subalgebra are left
invariant by m and

det(1  m) = det(1  mnc) = 0,

(7.24)

where the prime again indicates the omission of the zero eigenvalue associated
with .

to be more precise, a zero eigenvalue of the bosonic determinant det(1mnc)
should be interpreted as the inverse volume, r1 in the limit r  , whereas
the fermionic determinant vanishes identically. this means that only the cyclic
permutations contribute to the index and the expression (7.17) reduces to

i (n )

0 bulk = xcsn

1
n !

(det(1  mc))1.

(7.25)

the non-vanishing determinant det(1  mc) = n simply counts the winding
number of a fundamental d-particle world-line and the result is the obvious
generalization of the n = 2 case. the non-cyclic permutations do not contribute
to the index but have the interpretation of p disconnected d-particle world-lines

39

winding around the euclidean circle. this is a multi d-instanton conguration
and the vanishing of the determinant is due to the appearance of extra fermionic
zero modes. since each of the (n  1)! cyclic elements of sn gives the same
contribution to (7.25) the result is

n 2 = i (n )
def .
combining this with our earlier ansatz that i (n )
conclusion that

i (n )
0 bulk =

1

(7.26)

bulk = zn = 1 + 1/n 2 leads to the

i (n ) = i (n )

bulk + i (n )

def = 1,

(7.27)

for prime values of n . this is consistent with the presence of at least one bound
state for every prime value of n .

now consider the non-prime charge sector in which n = mn with m, n > 1.
it is useful to recall the interpretation of the d-instanton of charge n as a
single wrapped euclidean d-particle world-line. the contributions to the in-
stanton measure labelled by n were associated with the world-line of a charge-n
d-particle winding m = n/n times. in the case when n is prime the only con-
tribution to the decit term comes from n = 1, m = n , which corresponds to m
windings of a charge-n = 1 d-particle world-line. the other possibility, n = n ,
m = 1, gives the net contribution of one to the witten index of the threshold
bound state. it is therefore very compelling to assume that the contribution to
the witten index in the non-prime case, n = mn, of a subset of m d-particles
of charge n can be calculated in the same way as that of n fundamental (n = 1)
d-particles. in other words, we assume a generalization of the property that
was strongly motivated in the n = 2 case in [32, 33] that the decit term
is determined by free supersymmetric particle dynamics with 16 supercharges.
this means that the space of free-particle states that enters in the calculation
of i0 bulk should be enlarged to include the innite tower of charge-n threshold
bound states. in that case a cyclic permutation of m identical charge-n particles
contributes a term

i ( m)
0 bulk =

1
m2 ,

which leads to a total decit in the charge-n sector of

i (n )

def =  xm|n

m>1

i ( m)

0 bulk =  xm|n

m>1

1
m2 ,

(7.28)

(7.29)

consistent with the witten index i (n ) = 1 for all integer n .

the success of these assumptions points to the systematics that needs to
emerge from a more precise treatment of the integration over the boundary

40

term when n is not prime. this suggests that there are regions of moduli
space in which the non-abelian integration leads to m charge-n threshold bound
states which behave as free particles. related issues arise in the considerations
of [19, 20] concerning d-string instantons in d = 8 type i string theories.

the systematics of the ten-dimensional d-particle problem is consistent with
the expected features of d-particle quantum mechanics with less supersymme-
try. the clearest examples are in six and four dimensions. the six-dimensional
case is realized in the compactication of iia on k3 by wrapping d2-branes
around a two-cycle in k3 and scaling to the limit in which the two-cycle van-
ishes. using duality with the heterotic string on t 4 identies the resulting
d-particles as massless gauge particles which have no threshold bound states.
the four-dimensional case is realized by wrapping the type iib d3-brane around
a three-cycle in a calabiyau threefold and again scaling to the limit of zero
area as in [74]. the successful resolution of the conifold singularity in terms of
light states again requires the absence of threshold bound states. the absence
of threshold bound states in these cases implies that the witten index should
vanish. in both cases the bulk term in the n-particle index can be evaluated
explicitly (as in [73]) or extracted from the t-dual d-instanton problem (as in
[66]) and has the form

i (n ) d=4,6
bulk

=

1
n 2 .

(7.30)

furthermore, it is easy to see that in these cases the decit term is given by
i (n ) d=4,6
= 1/n 2 (assuming, as before, that it is given by the free-particle
def
index). the extra factor of n here compared to (7.26) comes about because in
these lower-dimensional cases the number of fermions is equal to the number of
bosons. this systematics suggests that

i (n ) d=4,6 = i (n ) d=4,6

bulk

+ i (n ) d=4,6

def

= 0,

(7.31)

as expected.

8 the ads/cft correspondence and higher

derivative terms

up to now the discussion of the higher derivative terms has been in the context
of the low energy eective action of string theory or m theory compactied on a
circle or two-torus. we now turn to consider the eect of the higher derivative
terms when the iib string propagates in an ads5s5 background (much of this
section and section 9 is based on [75, 76]). for our purposes it will be sucient

41

to consider the euclidean version of ads5, which has a boundary with topology
s4 (or r4). the metric will be parameterized by

ds2 =

l2
2 (dx  dx + d2) + d5

2 =

l2
2 (dx  dx + dy  dy),

(8.1)

where (x, yi) ( = 0, , 3, i = 1, , 6) are ten-dimensional cartesian coor-
dinates with 2 = y2 and d2
5 is the spherically-symmetric constant curvature
metric on s5 with radius l. in these coordinates the ads boundary is located
at  = 0. the second equality in (8.1) makes it obvious that the metric is
conformally equivalent to the at ten-dimensional metric. this will prove to
be important later. the only nonvanishing curvature components in this back-
ground are

rm n p q = 

1
l2 (gm p gn q  gm qgn p )

rmnpq = +

1
l2 (gmpgnq  gmqgnp)

(8.2)
(upper case latin indices, m, n, . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, label the ads5 coordinates
and lower case latin indices, m, n, . . . = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 label the s5 coordinates).
the non-vanishing components of the ricci tensor are

rmn = 

4
l2 gmn

rmn = +

4
l2 gmn ,

(8.3)

so that the scalar curvature vanishes. the dilaton and c(0) are arbitrary con-
stants and the only other eld that is nonvanishing in the ads5s5 background
is f5, which has the solution,

fm n p qr =

1
l

m n p qr,

fmnpqr =

1
l

mnpqr,

(8.4)

which corresponds to a conguration in which the total rr charge associated
with f5 is equal to 2l4e, which must be an integer, n . the isometry of
this space is the product so(4, 2)  su (4). these factors package together
with fermionic symmetries into the supergroup osp(4, 2|4) which also acts as a
superconformal symmetry group on the boundary.

this background is maximally supersymmetric (just like the minkowski vac-
uum) and there are 32 conserved supercharges that transform as a complex chiral
spinor of the tangent-space group, so(4, 1) so(5). in the basis where the ten
dimensional  matrices15 a re given by m = 1mi and m = 2im,
the supersymmetries are generated by the killing spinors that satisfy

d 

1
2l

(1  i  i) = 0,

(8.5)

15in this section and the next the ten-dimensional gamma matrices will be denoted by upper

case  while lower case  will be reserved for four-dimensional gamma matrices.

42

which follows from the requirement that the gravitino supersymmetry transfor-
mation should vanish. in this basis the complex chiral supersymmetry param-
eter reads

 =(cid:18) 1

0(cid:19)     ,

(8.6)

where  is a complex four-component so(4, 1) spinor and  is a complex four-
component so(5) spinor. the killing spinor equation (8.5) has components

dm

2l

m  = 0,

dm  i

m = 0.

(8.7)

(8.8)

the killing spinors  on s5 may be used to construct the kaluza-klein exci-
tations of all the elds in the iib gauged supergravity starting from the modes
of the massless complex singlet scalar. we will later make use of the euclidean
continuation of the killing spinors on ads5, which requires strategically placed
factors of i.

the metric (8.1) can be obtained from the geometry of a stack of coincident
d3-branes, where each d3-brane carries a unit charge associated with f5 =
dc(4). the eective world-volume theory of n coincident d3-branes is described
by u (n ) gauge theory, where the integer n is again the total r  r charge.
in terms of the low energy supergravity theory the classical d3-brane geometry
interpolates from the minkowski region far away from the horizon to the near-
horizon geometry, which is ads5  s5. the transition region grows with n and
the n   limit considered in [77, 34] is one in which the horizon region lls
all space. this leads to the ads/cft conjecture [34] which suggests that the
bulk string theory is equivalent to superconformal n = 4 su(n) yangmills
theory on the boundary16 (see also [35, 36]). the supergroup osp(4, 2|4) is
that associated with the superconformal n = 4 yangmills theory.
according to this idea the eective action of type iib supergravity, evaluated
on a solution of the equations of motion with prescribed boundary conditions, is
equated with the generating functional of connected gauge-invariant correlation
functions in the yangmills theory. the parameters of the n = 4 yangmills
theory and the iib superstring on ads5  s5 are related by the dictionary,

g =

y m

g2
4

2 c(0) = y m

l2

 =qg2

y m n ,

(8.9)

where g = e and c(0) are the arbitrary constant scalar string elds, gy m is the
yangmills coupling and y m is the vacuum angle. the complex yangmills

16it has been argued in [36, 78] that the theory should be su (n ) and not u (n ).

43

coupling is therefore identied with the constant boundary value of the complex
scalar eld of the iib superstring,

s =

g2

y m

= c(0) +

i

.

(8.10)

this explicit connection between the bulk theory and the boundary theory can
be expressed symbolically in terms of the generating functions [36, 35, 79],

exp(siib [m(j)]) =z da exp(sy m [a] + o[a]j).

(8.11)

the left-hand side is the generating function for the amplitudes in iib super-
string theory or its low energy supergravity limit. the eective action siib is
evaluated in terms of the massless supergravity elds and their kaluzaklein
descendents, that we have generically indicated with (z; ), where  are the
coordinates on s5 and zm  (x, ) (m = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and  = 0, 1, 2, 3) are the
ads5 coordinates. the notation in (8.11) indicates that this action depends on
the boundary data, j(x), of the bulk elds. the right-hand side of (8.11) is the
generating function of the correlation functions of the gauge-invariant composite
operators, o(a), to which j couples in the boundary n = 4 supersymmetric
yangmills, where the uctuating yangmills potential is denoted by a.
for general values of the dimensionless ratio, /l2, an expansion in powers
of  is not necessarily a good approximation to the theory. only for ads5 scales
that are large compared to the string scale, i.e.  << l2, is t he curvature
small and the  expansion can still be interpreted as a derivative expansion
in the nontrivial background. it follows from (8.9) that in this regime classical
supergravity is related to the yangmills limit in which g2
y m n  . this
requires n   (since sl(2, zz) duality can always be used to map the large
string coupling to a value that is not large). since, according to t hooft [80]
the quantity g2
y m n is the coupling constant of large-n yangmills theory we
see that the ads/cft conjecture relates the strong coupling limit of one theory
to the weak coupling limit of the other. several tests of this conjecture have
been made at the level of the two-point and three-point correlations of currents
[81] based on the semiclassical approximation to the bulk supergravity (g << 1)
which is valid in the limit /l2 << 1, which corresponds to the large-n limit
with g2

y m n xed at a large value.

the spectrum of iib supergravity compactied on ads5  s5 is described
in [82]. here we are most interested in the identication of the lowest lying
modes that form the supergravity supermultiplet. while the massless dilaton is
associated with the constant mode on s5, i.e. with the scalar spherical harmonic
y with  = 0, the other scalars in the supermultiplet are associated with exci-
tations on the 5-sphere. in particular the real scalars qij (i, j, k = 1, 2, . . . , 6),

44

with mass m2 = 4/l2 in the 20
r of the so(6) isometry group of s5 result
from a combination of the trace of the internal metric and the self-dual r  r
ve-form eld, f (5), with  = 2 (qij are quadrupole moments of s5). simi-
larly the complex scalars eab with mass m2 = 3/l2 and their conjugates (in
the 10) are associated with the pure two-form uctuations with  = 1 of the
complexied antisymmetric tensor in the internal directions. the 15 massless
vectors v [ij]
m that gauge the so(6) isometry group are in one-to-one correspon-
dence with the killing vectors of s5 and result from a linear combination with
 = 1 of the mixed components of the metric and the internal three-form com-
ponents of the r  r four-form potential, c(4). the 6 complex antisymmetric
tensors b[ab]

the above elds are those that act as sources for the superconformal currents
in the boundary yangmills theory. the higher kaluzaklein modes on s5,
which have higher values of , are bulk elds of dimension  = l. the boundary
value of any of these elds couples to a composite gauge invariant operator in
the yangmills theory that can be expressed as a rank l symmetric traceless
tensor of so(6) (the isometry group of s5) made from a product of l superelds
of the boundary theory. these operators will not concern us in the following
but are a vital part of the complete story.

whereas the duality group for the type iib theory compactied on t 6 is
e6(+6),zz the duality group for the ads5  s5 background is sl(2, zz), which
is inherited from ten dimensions. the local symmetry group is u (4) where the
u (1) factor is a remnant of the local symmetry of at ten-dimensional classical
supergravity. however, there is no corresponding u (1) symmetry in the n = 4
yangmills boundary theory where the r-symmetry is su (4). this ts with
the fact that in iib string theory the classical sl(2, ir) is replaced by (local)
sl(2, zz) and the continuous u (1) symmetry is not present.

8.1 n = 4 yangmills elds and supercurrents
the n = 4 four-dimensional yangmills theory is classically invariant under
superconformal transformations as well as under global su (4) transformations,

avoid confusion with the gaugino of the yangmills theory which is denoted by lower case .

which form the r-symmetry group of automorphisms of the n = 4 super-
symmetry algebra. the physical elds comprise six real scalars, four weyl
spinors, and one gauge vector potential, all in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group, which may be arbitrary in general but should be su (n ) for the
most straightforward application of the ads/cft correspondence. the real
scalars, i (i = 1, . . . , 6), form a 6 of the su (4) r symmetry group and can

the  function for this theory vanishes which means that the quantum theory
is expected to share the superconformal invariance of the classical theory. the
noether currents associated with these superconformal transformations, as well
as the chiral su (4) transformations, form a supermultiplet with 256 component
currents, including the energy-momentum tensor [83, 84]. for example, the
lowest member of the supermultiplet is the scalar current that couples to qij,

qij = ij  ijkk/6.

(8.16)

equation (8.16) only involves the bilinear terms in the current, but it is impor-
tant that the full nonabelian currents also contain higher-order contributions
[76] which are crucial in verifying the ads/cft correspondence [85]. the cur-
rent that couples to the boundary value of the dilatino is

(8.17)

(again in the linearized approximation). the complete list of currents in the
supermultiplet is given in [84]. these superconformal currents are in one to one
correspondence with the elds of the supergravity multiplet.

from the ads/cft conjecture the supersymmetrized einsteinhilbert ac-
tion gives the leading large-g2
y m n contributions to the correlation functions of
the superconformal currents. for example, a correlation function of m stress
tensors,

ht11 (x1)t22(x2) . . . tr r (xr) . . . tm m (xm ),

(8.18)

corresponds to bulk superstring amplitudes in which the boundary values of the
gravitons have polarizations, hr r , which are oriented in the four-dimensional
minkowski directions, r = mr, r = nr where mr, nr = 0, 1, 2, 3. since the co-
ecient of the einsteinhilbert term is e24 = l8n 2 the leading behaviour
of the correlation functions obtained in this manner is of order n 2. in general
there is little known about such yangmills correlation functions at large t
hooft coupling. however, the free-eld value of the correlation functions of two
superconformal currents, such as ht11 (x1
2 )i, is known to be exact
[86, 87] by virtue of the relation of this correlation function to the r-symmetry
anomaly, which is not renormalized due to the adlerbardeen theorem. an
analogous ward identity prevents the three-point correlation function of super-
conformal currents (in the n = 4 theory, but not for n < 4) from receiving
renormalizations beyond those of the free eld theory [88]. these free-eld
correlators of two and three superconformal currents are both proportional to

1 )t22 (x2

dim (su (n )) = n 2  1.

(8.19)

47

the leading factor of n 2 corresponds to the coecient of 4g2 in the
einsteinhilbert action. this would be the exact n -dependence if the gauge
group were u (n ) but (8.19) shows that there must be one other contribution
to the einsteinhilbert action in the ads5  s5 background that arises at order
n 2 (order 4) relative to the leading term. such a term might come from a
one string loop eect which has not yet been elucidated. since the terms that
concern us here are of order 3 relative to the leading term they dominate over
this eect.

8.2 generalities concerning higher derivatives terms
we wish to consider the eects of the o(1) terms on the ads/cft conjecture.
since these terms are suppressed by 3 relative to the leading terms they will
correspond to o(n 3/2) corrections to the leading behaviour. the interesting
feature of these terms is that they manifest the sl(2, zz) duality in a very
nontrivial fashion.

we saw from the denition of the r4 term, (3.11), that the only components
of the curvature which contribute are those of the weyl tensor. we can expand
r4 (dened in (3.12)) in uctuations around its classical value, r(0)
4 ,

r4 = r(0)

4 + r4,

(8.20)

where r is the uctuation19. since ads5  s5 is conformally at the weyl
tensor vanishes and it follows that

r(0)

4 = 0.

(8.21)

this leads immediately to several consequences:

1. r4 = 0 in the ads5  s5 background, which means that the dilaton

equation of motion is unchanged in this background.

2. r4/g = 0 (since the dierential is proportional to (r(0)

4 )3), which
means that the einstein equation is also unaected. it is also easy to see
that none of the other o(3) terms which are related to r4 by super-
symmetry contribute to the equations of motion. this means that the
ads5  s5 background is unaltered by the presence of this term, so this
background is a solution of the eective equations of motion of string the-
ory through o(3), to all orders in g (a more general superspace argument
19a more complete discussion, given in [89], shows that there is a eld denition in which
the o-shell uctuations of the metric can be restricted to those that only give uctuations to
the weyl com ponents of the curvature.

48

leads to the statement that this background is exact to all orders in 
[90]).

3. equation (8.21) also implies that











g

g

r4(cid:12)(cid:12)ads5s5 = 0 =

this shows that there is no renormalization of the graviton two-point or
three-point functions in the ads5  s5 background at o( 3).

(8.22)

however, there is a non-zero four-graviton contribution from the r4 term
which is obtained by dierentiating four times with respect to the metric. this
gives a contribution to the amplitude which adds to the term which arises from
the einsteinhilbert action, so that up to o( 3) the four-graviton amplitude is
proportional to

is the classical amplitude obtained from the einsteinhilbert
is the contribution from the r4 term and k is a well-
for example, the contribution of the r4 term to four-graviton scattering is
obtained by contracting the linearized r4 vertex with four graviton propagators
that propagate from the interaction point at (x
0 , 0) to the boundary at points
(x0 r, 0,r = 0), where r labels the position of the rth boundary eld. the
linearized curvature is

r1111 = d1d1h11 ,

(8.24)

where h is the linearized uctuation of the metric around its value in ads5s5
and d is the ads5  s5 covariant derivative. the bulk-to-boundary graviton
propagator in ads5 s5 is an obvious generalization [91] of the scalar and spin-
1/2 propagators that will appear in later sections. the four-graviton interaction
vertex can be expressed in the form (2.18) where the tensors t8 in the kinematic
factor k have the form of the product of four inverse ads5s5 metrics summed
over various permutations of their indices.
using the ads/cft conjecture the r4 term gives a contribution to the cor-
relation functions of stress tensors in the boundary yangmills eld theory that
are suppressed by a factor of n 3/2 relative to the leading free-eld contribution.
the vanishing of the graviton one-point function, translates into the statement
that the one-point function of the stress tensor hti vanishes, which follows
from conformal invariance. similarly, the vanishing of the 1r4 contribution

49

to the two-graviton and three-graviton s-matrix elements in iib supergravity
translates into the statements that the correlation functions of two and of three
stress tensors in n = 4 yangmills theory is not renormalized from the free-eld
value at this order in n 1. this is in accord with the exact results [86, 87, 88]
cited earlier.

it is only when we come to the four-graviton amplitude that the r4 term
contributes and therefore the correlation function of four stress tensors gets a
new contribution. the supergravity calculations give the following expression
for the momentum-space correlation function of four stress tensors,

4 + kn 1/2f (0,0)(s, s)a(2)

4 = ht11(1)t22 (2)t33 (3)t44 (4)i = n 2a(1)

where a(1)
is the contribution at leading order in (g2

rection arising from the r4 term (and an irrelevant constant has been absorbed
into k). the term a(1)
comes from the four-graviton amplitude computed from
4
the einstein action in ads5  s5, while a(2)
corresponds to the four-graviton
vertex in the r4 term. no further terms are necessary at this order in the  ex-
pansion. the scalar eld  is now interpreted as the complex coupling constant,

the second term in (8.25) has a remarkable amount of information concern-
ing the yangmills theory. it is the rst non-leading term in the 1/n expansion
but is an exactly known function of the (complex) coupling. as we have seen,
the factor f (0,0) contains two terms that are perturbative in string theory and
an innite number of d-instanton terms. therefore, in the limit gy m  0 with

which includes an innite series of instanton corrections. we will return to a
discussion of these corrections later. an important property of this expression is
its invariance under sl(2, zz) (which is interpreted as montonenolive electro-
magnetic duality). this transformation, which maps the small coupling regime
to large coupling, is manifest in (8.25) but not in (8.26), which is the t hooft
expansion, and is only valid when gy m is very small. the presence of noninte-
ger powers of g2
y m n in this expansion is one indication of how far removed the
strong coupling expansion is from weakly coupled perturbation theory.

8.3 the scalar ads green function and the instanton pro-

le.

in order to make use of (8.11) to perform explicit detailed calculations of yang
mills correlation functions we need to evaluate the bulk-to-boundary green
functions for the various elds of the bulk theory. these are dened as specic
normalized limits of bulk-to-bulk green functions [35, 36, 88] when one point is
taken to the ads boundary. the precise forms of these propagators depend on
the spin and mass of the eld. for example, the normalized bulk-to-boundary
green function for the ads laplace operator for a dimension  scalar eld is
given by

g(x, , ; x, 0, ) = c k(x, ; x, 0),

(8.27)

which is independent of  and where c = ()/(2(  2)) and

k(x, ; x, 0) =



(2 + (x  x)2) .

(8.28)

the expression (8.27) is appropriate for an s-wave process in which there are
no excitations in the directions of the ve-sphere, s5. in terms of k the bulk
eld

m(z; j) = cz d4xk(x, ; x, 0)j(x)

satises the boundary condition as   0,

(8.29)

(8.30)

m(x, ; j)  4j(x),

since 4k reduces to a -function on the boundary. the conformal dimen-
sion of the operator is related to the ads mass of the corresponding bulk eld

by (ml)2 = (  4), so that  = 2 p4 + (ml)2 and only the positive
branch,  = +, is relevant for the lowest-mass supergravity multiplet. in the
case of a massless scalar eld (+ = 4) the propagator reduces to (4)(x  x)
in the limit   0. in comparing the d-instanton contributions of the bulk the-
ory with the yangmills instanton contributions to the boundary theory it is of
signicance, as we will see in section 9, that the green function k4 dened in
(8.28) has the same form (up to an additive constant) as the prole of e in the
d-instanton solution centered on the point (x, ) in ads5  s5 and evaluated
at the boundary point (x, 0).
we now turn to the yangmills instanton. recall that that the instanton
solution for the su (2) yangmills potential gives a nontrivial nonabelian eld
strength of the form

which is again equal to the scalar green function for the  = 4 case where
the fth coordinate  is now identied with the instanton scale. this is a key
observation in identifying d-instanton eects of the bulk theory with yang
mills instanton eects in the boundary theory. it is related to the fact that the
moduli space of a yangmills instanton on s4 has an ads5 factor.

9 d-instantons and yangmills instantons

we now want to compare the leading order one-instanton contribution to the
supersymmetric yangmills correlation functions with the amplitudes of the
iib superstring theory with appropriate boundary conditions. for illustrative
purposes we will only consider the sixteen- amplitude in the ads5  s5 back-
ground and the corresponding yangmills sixteen- correlation function [76].
from either perspective the leading instanton contribution arises from the prod-
uct of sixteen factors each carrying one single fermionic zero mode. correlation
functions of other superconformal currents can be calculated in analogous fash-
ion. for certain of these it is possible to express the result very explicitly in
terms of dilogarithms [76, 92].

from the bulk type iib point of view we are interested in the leading d-
instanton contribution to amplitudes, which may either be extracted directly
from the exactly known o( 1) terms in the eective action (method (a) below)
or deduced by integration over the uctuations around the classical ads5  s5
d-instanton solution (method (c)). from the yangmills perspective we are
interested in the instanton contributions to supercurrent correlators of the n =
4 theory (method (b)).

method (a). expansion of 1f (12,12)16 term in bulk iib supergravity
the rst method for obtaining this amplitude is to expand the function
f (12,12) in order to extract the one-instanton term. the leading behaviour
comes from the leading power of g12 =  12
in f1,12 dened by (6.3) and (6.5).
we want to consider the situation in which all sixteen fermions propagate to
specic values on the boundary. the dirac operator acting on spin-1/2 elds in
ads5 was given in [93, 94] as

(9.3)

where j(x) is a left-handed boundary value of  and acts as the source for
the composite operator  in the boundary n = 4 yangmills theory satisfying
5j = j. as a result, the classical action for the operator ()16 in the

where j(xp) is the wave-function of the dilatino evaluated at the boundary
point (xp, 0) and we have set e = g and c(0) = c(0) (since the scalar elds
are taken to be constant in the ads5  s5 background) and vs5 = 3 is the
s5 volume. the spinor indices on the js are contracted with the rank-sixteen
antisymmetric tensor, a1a2...a16
. we have not kept track of the overall constant
normalization in this expression. the nal integration over the moduli x
0 , 0
has not been carried out explicitly in (9.4). for certain of the other correlation
functions the integration over the instanton moduli can be evaluated in terms
of standard functions [76, 92]. according to (8.11) the sixteen-  yangmills
correlation function is extracted from (9.4) by dierentiating with respect to all
the js.

16

method (b). sixteen- correlator in the boundary yangmills theory
we will now consider the correlation function of sixteen fermionic supercon-

formal current operators in a charge-one instanton background,

where  is dened in (8.17). the su (2) yangmills instanton has sixteen
supermoduli which correspond to the fermionic zero modes that are induced by
the broken supersymmetries. the special feature of the product of elds inside
the correlator (9.5), as well as the others that are related by supersymmetry,
is that they provide precisely the sixteen fermionic zero modes that are needed
to give a nonzero result in the instanton background. in particular, it is easy
to see that  is linear in fermionic zero modes so a total of sixteen factors is
needed for a non-zero result. to leading order in gy m , g16 does not receive
contribution from anti-instantons.

the fermionic zero modes can be deduced by applying the broken com-
ponents of the supersymmetry transformations to the elds. the bilinear

integration over the fermion zero modes leads to the sixteen-index invariant
tensor 16. converting to four-component spinor notation and using (8.11) this
result coincides with (9.4), up to the undetermined overall constant.

one is entitled to ask why such a comparison of a d-instanton eect with a
su (2) yangmills instanton eect is being made in the rst place. in method (a)
we used the expression for the o(1) interaction in the ads5  s5 background
which should only be a good approximation to strongly coupled su (n ) yang
mills in the limit n  . on the other hand method (b) computed the
eect of an su (2) yangmills instanton. however, as will be described in the
nal subsection, the n -dependence of these correlation functions was shown in
[39] to only aect the overall coecient of the correlation function and not its
functional form. furthermore, the coecient has the expected large-n limit,
n 1/2. this will be reviewed in the last subsection along with the results in
[40, 41] which demonstrate that the large-n limit of the yangmills calculation
agrees perfectly with the leading d-instanton contribution even in the multi-
instanton sectors.

54

9.1 the classical d-instanton in at space and in ads5 s5

later in this subsection we will evaluate the single d-instanton terms in the
sixteen-dilatino amplitude in ads5  s5 by semi-classical quantization in the
background of a d-instanton solution of type iib supergravity (this is method
(c)). first we need to recall some properties of the classical d-instanton solution.
in at ten-dimensional euclidean space the charge-k d-instanton solution
is a nite-action euclidean supersymmetric (bpssaturated) solution in which
the metric is trivial (g =  in the einstein frame) but the complex scalar
 = c(0) + ie has a nontrivial prole with a singularity at the position of
the d-instanton. the (euclidean) r  r scalar is related to the dilaton by the
bps condition c(0) = ie, while the dilaton solution is the harmonic
function (correcting an error in [53])

(10)

e

(9.8)

this is the classical solution of the ten-dimensional laplace equation, 2e = 0,
0 (where x  is the ten-
outside an innitesimal sphere centered on the point x 
0 is the location of the d-instanton20), g is the
dimensional coordinate and x 
asymptotic value of the string coupling and the normalization of the second
term has a quantized value by virtue of a condition analogous to the dirac
nepomechieteitelboim condition that quantizes the charge of an electrically
charged p-brane and of its magnetically charged p-brane dual [95, 96].
it is
notable that the solution in (9.8) is simply the green function for a scalar eld
to propagate from x0 to x subject to the boundary condition that e = g at
|x|   or |x0|  .
we are now interested in solving the equations of motion of the iib theory in
euclidean ads5  s5. the bps condition for a d-instanton in this background
again requires e = ic(0) that leads to
ge = 0,

(9.9)

and (in the einstein frame) the einstein equations are unaltered by the presence
of the d-instanton so that ads5  s5 remains a solution. equation (9.9) is
identical to the equation for the green function of a massless scalar propagating
between the location of the d-instanton (x
0) and the point (x, yi), which

we will only be interested in the case in which the point (x, yi) approaches

is of relevance in the   0 limit.
as mentioned earlier, the correspondence with the yangmills instanton
0)4 = k4 is proportional to the
0/((x  x0)2 + 2
follows from the fact that 4
instanton number density, (f 
(0))2, in the n = 4 yangmills theory. strikingly,
the scale size of the yangmills instanton is replaced by the distance 0 of
the d-instanton from the boundary. this is another indication of how the
geometry of the yangmills theory is encoded in the iib superstring. note,
in particular, that as the d-instanton approaches the boundary 0  0, the
expression for 4e  reduces to a  function that corresponds to a zero-size
yangmills instanton.

the bps condition implies that we can write the solution for the r  r

scalar as

(9.12)
where c(0) is the constant real part of the eld (which corresponds to y m /2)
and

c(0) = c(0) + if (x, y),

f = a 

1
g

+ e .

(9.13)

since the action is independent of constant shifts of c(0) it does not depend
on the arbitrary constant, a.
in a manner that follows closely the at ten-
dimensional case considered in the appendix of [11] the action for a single d-
instanton of charge k can be written as

sk = 

l10

4 z dd4xd5

5

g(e2 f f ),

(9.14)

which reduces to an integral over the boundaries of ads5s5 and the surface of
an innitesimal sphere centered on the d-instanton at x = x0, y = y0. with the

56

choice a = 0 in (9.13) the entire d-instanton action comes from the boundary
of the innitesimal sphere. substituting for f from (9.13 gives

sk =

2|k|

g

,

(9.15)

which is the same answer as in the at ten-dimensional case. on the other
hand, with the choice a = 1/g in (9.13) the expression (9.14) reduces to an
integral over the boundary at  = 0 but the total action remains the same as
sk in (9.15). remarkably, in this case the boundary integrand is identical to
the action density of the standard four-dimensional yangmills instanton. it is
crucial for this agreement that the integral (9.14) includes an integral over the
s5 factor even though the classical moduli space of the yangmills instanton
does not include an s5. this is a concrete manifestation of the holographic
principle whereby the physics of the bulk is encoded on the boundary [97, 98].
whereas the ads5  s5 metric remains unchanged by the presence of the
d-instanton in the einstein frame it is radically altered in the string frame
where the instanton is manifested as a space-time wormhole (as in the at ten-
dimensional case [53]). for nite values of k the dilaton becomes large in
the planck-scale neck and the classical solution is not reliable in that region.
however, for very large instanton number, the neck region becomes much larger
than the planck scale so, by analogy with the d-brane examples studied in [34],
it should be very interesting to study the implications of the modied ads5s5
geometry in the large-k limit of the large-n theory.

method (c). fluctuations around a classical d-instanton

the d-instanton contribution to the amplitude with sixteen external dilatini,
a
 , may now be obtained directly by semi-classical quantization around the
classical d-instanton solution in ads5  s5. the leading instanton contribution
can be determined by applying supersymmetry transformations to the scalar
eld which has an instanton prole given by (9.11). since the d-instanton
background breaks half the supersymmetries the relevant transformations are
those in which the supersymmetry parameter corresponds to the killing spinors
for the sixteen broken supersymmetries. these killing spinors have u (1) charge
1/2 and are dened by a modied version of (8.5) that includes the non-trivial
composite u (1) connection, qm [59], that is made from the iib scalar eld [53],

dm   (dm

posite connection gives

the sixteen broken supersymmetry transformations associated with (0)

 give

rise to the dilatino zero-modes,

(0) =  = (m pm ),

(9.19)

where pm is the expression for pm  im  /22 in the d-instanton background
[11],

(9.20)
using the killing spinor equation and the d-instanton equation dm pm = 0 it
is easy to check (recalling that pm has u (1) charge 2) that

pm = e m e

.

mdm (0) = 

3

(9.21)

so that (0) is a solution of the appropriate massive dirac equation. we will be
interested in amplitudes with external states located on the boundary, in which
case we may use the fact that for   0,

(9.23)

this means that near  = 0 the dilatino prole in the d-instanton background
is proportional to 4k4(x0, 0; x, 0).

as a result the leading contribution to the sixteen-dilatino amplitude again
reproduces the corresponding sixteen-current correlator in n = 4 supersym-
metric yangmills theory. explicitly, the d-instanton approximation to the
a, at points on the  = 0 boundary
amplitude with sixteen external dilatini, 
is (up to an overall constant factor)

the overall factor of (const.) g12 in this expression should be derived from the
normalization of the bosonic and fermionic zero modes but it has been inserted
by hand. up to this overall constant factor, the amplitude (9.24) agrees with
(9.7) and therefore with (9.4).

in similar manner the instanton proles of all the elds in the supergravity
multiplet follow by applying the broken supersymmetries to pm any number
of times, just as they do in the at ten-dimensional case [11]. the single d-
instanton contributions to any correlation function can then be determined.

9.2 instantons in the limit of large n

we now return briey to the issue of comparing the d-instanton and yang
mills instanton eects for gauge groups su (n ) in the limit n  . the string
computation was valid only in the region of large g2n since we kept only the
rst term in the  expansion that contributes to r4. in the classical n = 4
yangmills theory with a gauge group su (n ) an instanton background has 8n
fermion zero modes, 2n for each of the 4 adjoint weyl fermions. it is a special
feature of the n = 2 case that the number of fermionic zero modes coincides with
the number of broken supersymmetries but for larger values of n there are more
fermionic zero modes in the classical d-instanton background than the number
of broken supersymmetries. however, most of these modes receive perturbative
corrections that gives them nonzero energy and the only zero modes which are
protected are the sixteen which correspond to broken supersymmetries. in other
words, most of the classical zero modes are not protected by symmetries and do
not cause the correlation functions that we have been discussing (such as the
16 correlator) to vanish.

the measure for a yangmills instanton for the group su (n ) was considered
a long time ago in nonsupersymmetric theories. the measure is dened as
the jacobian for the transformation from bosonic zero-modes to the collective
coordinates and for pure su (n ) yangmills it has the form [99]

(2)4n

(n  1)!(n  2)!(cid:18) 0

gy m(cid:19)4n d0d4x0

5
0

(9.25)

(where 0 is an arbitrary scale), which accounts for the number of ways of
embedding the su (2) instanton solution in su (n ) and the coupling constant
dependence is due to the eight bosonic zero modes [100].
in supersymmet-
ric theories this coecient is modied due to the gaussian uctuations of the
other elds. in [39] the measure for a single yangmills instanton in su (n )
n = 4 supersymmetric yangmills was computed, including the integration
over fermionic zero modes. the result is that the factor (9.25) is replaced by

59

(dropping irrelevant constants)

g8
y m 22n

(2n  2)!

(n  1)!(n  2)!

,

(9.26)

so that the overall power of the coupling is the same as in the su (2) case with
n = 4 supersymmetry that we considered earlier but there is now an explicit
n -dependent coecient. the large-n limit of this expression can be extracted
by using stirlings approximation for the gamma functions with the result that
the overall measure at large n is proportional to

y m n 1/2  1 7/2
g8

2

,

(9.27)

which agrees with the k = 1 case of the expression deduced from the d-
instanton measure in (6.11).

the large-n limit of the contribution of k instantons to the protected pro-
cesses that we have been considering was derived in two interesting recent papers
[40, 41]. making extensive use of the adhm construction this paper showed
that the large-n limit is dominated by a saddle point which constrains the k
su (2) instantons to a very special point in the multi-instanton moduli space.
this is a point in the subspace of the full moduli space at which the instan-
tons are in k commuting su(2) subgroups of su(n). clearly, this can only be
precisely true for n  . for nite n such congurations may dominate for
k << n but when k > n/2 no such congurations exist. furthermore, it
was shown in [40] that at the dominant saddle point the instantons coincide in
space and have equal scale sizes  they behave as a single charge-k instanton.
even more impressively, the evaluation of the large-n limit of the uctuations
of the elds around the coincident instantons induces ve new eective moduli
that parameterize the ve-sphere. finally, the overall coecient is identied in
[40, 41] with the partition function of the zero-dimensional matrix model, zk.
the result is that the eective moduli space of the leading contribution of k
yangmills instantons to the protected processes is ads5  s5. the resulting
measure coincides precisely with the leading term in the d-instanton measure
in (6.11) for general k  1.

these results apply to the instanton corrections to the protected processes at
leading power of the yangmills coupling constant. however, the full sl(2, zz)-
invariant structure of the yangmills correlation functions suggested by the
ads/cft correspondence in [75] is very much richer. we have seen that in
the limit g2
y m n   ( << l2) not only must each instanton contribution
to a correlation function be accompanied by an innite number of perturbative
corrections but there are vital non-instanton terms which correspond to the
tree-level and one-loop contributions in the string theory. these are the terms

60

in (8.26) that have fractional powers of gy m and are not visible in weakly-
coupled yangmills theory and therefore cannot be obtained by matching the
semiclassical approximations of the bulk and boundary theories. explaining the
nature of these terms from the yangmills perspective would appear to be of
some interest.

the rst term in this expansion combines with the kinematic factor, k, to
give the tree-level amplitude that is described by the einsteinhilbert action of
eleven-dimensional supergravity. the term with coecient (3) can be identied
(section 5 of these notes) with a one-loop eect in four-graviton scattering in
eleven-dimensional supergravity compactied on a circle of radius r11 = e2/3.
this explains the corresponding term in (a.1) when atree
is interpreted as a
type iia tree amplitude. when (a.1) is interpreted as a iib tree amplitude
the (3) term comes from the zero-volume limit of m theory on t 2. similarly,
there is some evidence [64] that the term with coecient (5) in (a.4) can be
identied with a two-loop eect in eleven-dimensional supergravity. the higher-
order terms in (a.4) give terms in the eective action with derivatives acting
on r4 and other higher-derivative terms.

b modular covariant derivatives.

the various coecient functions in the eective action are (w, w) forms, where
w refers to the holomorphic modular weight and w to the anti-holomorphic
modular weight. a nonholomorphic modular form f (w, w) transforms as,

f (w, w)  f (w, w) (c + d)w(c + d) w,

under the sl(2, zz) transformation (1.6). equation (b.1) describes a u (1) trans-
formation when w = w.

this relation between eigenvalue equations will be useful in analyzing the equa-
tions that are satised by the modular forms that enter in s(3).

this is (b.11) with w = 12, m = 0 and 12 = 132 + 3/4. it is also argued in
section 3 that f (12,12) is related to f (0,0) by

f (12,12) = d12f (0,0)  d11  d1d0f (0,0).

(b.14)

this equation together with (b.13) imply that f (0,0) satises (4.25).

more generally, let us denote a solution of the scalar laplace equation with

eigenvalue  = s(s  1) > 1/4 by es( ) [57],

2es = s(s  1) es.

we can express es( ) in terms of the nonholomorphic eisenstein series,

(b.15)

(b.16)

where (m, n) = 1 indicates that m and n are coprime. the eigenfunctions es( )
are singled out by their power law behavior near the boundary of the moduli
space, which agrees with the known tree-level and perturbative contributions to
the interactions that we are considering. the solution to the laplace equation
(b.15) is unique for a given s assuming that es is a modular function. therefore,
if we assume that f (0,0) is well-dened on the fundamental domain of sl(2, zz)
the solution is unique and its behaviour near the 2   boundary agrees with
the known tree-level and one-loop contributions.
it follows from (b.14) that
f (12,12) is also determined uniquely by its laplace equation (b.13). in this
case there are no string calculations with which to compare the perturbative
terms.qyn

c some properties of type iib supergravity

c.1 spinors and gamma matrices

the spinors that enter into the iib theory are complex weyl spinors. the
gravitino  and dilatino  have opposite chiralities and the supersymmetry
parameter  has the same chirality as the gravitino. the complex conjugate of
the product of a pair of spinors is dened by

(a b) = 

a 
b .

(c.1)

the conjugate of any spinor is dened by,  = 0. we will choose our metric
to be space-like and the  matrices to be real and satisfy the cliord algebra,

{, } = 2.

64

(c.2)

noting that,

0 = ()t 0,

(c.3)

it follows that two complex chiral spinors of the same chirality, 1 and 2, satisfy
the relations,

c.2 the elds and their supersymmetry transformations

here we will review various features of type iib supergravity that are useful in
the body of the paper. most of this material can be found in [58, 59] in a form
that is adapted to the eld denitions in which the global symmetry is su (1, 1)
and the scalar elds parameterize the coset space su (1, 1)/u (1), which is the
poincare disk. it is simple to transform this to our parameterization in which
the global symmetry is sl(2, ir) and the scalars parameterize the coset space
sl(2, ir)/u (1), or the upper half plane.

the theory is then dened in terms of the following elds: the scalar elds

can be parameterized by the frame eld,

v (cid:18) v 1

 v 1
+
 v 2
v 2

+(cid:19) =

1

2i2 (cid:18)  ei

ei

 ei

ei (cid:19) ,

(c.15)

where v 
 ( = 1, 2) is a sl(2, zz) matrix that transforms from the left by the
global sl(2, ir) and from the right by the local u (1). note that we are using a
complex basis for convenience. a general transformation is then written as,

(v 

+ , v 

 )  u 

(cid:16)v 

66

+ ei, v 

 ei(cid:17) ,

(c.16)

where u is a sl(2, ir) matrix and  is the u (1) phase. an appropriate choice
of  xes the gauge and eliminates the scalar eld . we will make the gauge
choice  = 0. since this gauge is not maintained by generic symmetry trans-
formations, it is necessary to compensate a symmetry transformation with an
appropriate local u (1) tranformation to maintain the gauge. in particular, the
local supersymmetry transformations require compensating local u (1) transfor-
mations. the supersymmetry and u (1) transformations of v 

 are given by,

(0)v 

 = iv 

+   iv 
 .

(c.17)

this choice ensures that the gauge  = 0 is maintained if a local supersymmetry
transformation is accompanied by a u (1) transformation with parameter,

 =

1
2

(  ).

the sl(2, ir) singlet expression,

q = i v 

+ v 
 ,

(c.18)

(c.19)

is the composite u (1) connection and transforms as q  q +  under in-
nitesimal local u (1) transformations, while the sl(2, ir) singlet expression

p = v

the fermions comprise the complex chiral gravitino, a

, which has u (1)
charge u = 1/2, and the dilatino, a, with u (1) charge u = 3/2. these two
elds have opposite chiralities. the graviton is a u (1) and sl(2, ir) singlet
as is the antisymmetric fourth-rank potential, c(4), which has a eld strength
f5 = dc(4). as is well known, this eld strength has an equation of motion that
is expressed by the self-duality condition f5 = f5, which cannot be obtained
from a globally well-dened lagrangian. for this reason, our considerations are
restricted to statements concerning the on-shell properties of the theory where
the elds satisfy the equations of motion.

the two antisymmetric second-rank potentials, b and c(2)

 , have eld
strengths f 1 (n s  n s) and f 2 (r  r) that form an sl(2, ir) doublet, f .
it is very natural to package them into the sl(2, ir) singlet elds,

g = v 

+ f ,

g = v 

 f ,

(c.23)

67

which carry u (1) charges ug = +1 and ug = 1, respectively.

in a xed u (1) gauge, a global sl(2, ir) transformation which acts on  by

 

a + b
c + d

,

(c.24)

with ad  bc = 1, induces a u (1) transformation on the elds that depends on
their charge. thus, a eld  with u (1) charge u transforms as,

   (cid:18) c + d

c + d(cid:19)u/2

.

(c.25)

the higher derivative terms of interest to us only repect the sl(2, zz) subgroup
of sl(2, ir) for which a, b, c, d are integers and the continuous u (1) symmetry
is broken.

the supersymmetry of the action is naturally described in terms of combi-
nations of bosonic elds and fermion bilinears which are supercovariant, which
means that they do not contain derivatives of the supersymmetry parameter 
in their transformations. these combinations are,

d fermions in m theory on t 2

the massless fermions of the type ii string theories on s1 are identied with
particular projections of the eleven-dimensional gravitino compactied on t 2.
in order to calculate the 16 loop amplitude we need to identify the particular
projection that isolates the spin-half dilatino of the type iib theory.

compactication of the iib theory on a circle s1 of circumference rb (in
string frame) in the direction x9 breaks the so(9, 1) lorentz symmetry to
so(8, 1). the complex chiral spin- 1
2 fermion  simply becomes a complex

69

spinor of so(8, 1). the gravitino decomposes into a nine-dimensional gravitino
 (where the so(8, 1) vector index  = 0, 1, , 8) together with a second
complex spin- 1
(d.1)

2 fermion,

a = rba
9 ,

where the factor of rb comes from the component e99 of the zehnbein. the
nine-dimensional gravitino is dened by shifting a,

a = a +

1
7

a9

(d.2)

(where a labels the nine-dimensional tangent space, a = 0, 1  , 8) so that the
kinetic term is diagonal.
we will now identify the components of the t 2 compactication of eleven-
dimensional gravitino,  ( = 0, , 9, 11), that correspond to the iib fermions
on s1. compactication on t 2 breaks the local lorentz symmetry
from
so(10, 1) to so(8, 1)  so(2). the nine-dimensional fermions can then be
organized into eigenstates of so(2)  u (1), which is related to the u (1) in the
denominator of the coset space of the iib theory. the world indices split into
the compact directions  = 9, 11 and the noncompact directions  = 0, , 8.
making a block diagonal ansatz, the elfbein e m

 , is written as

e m

 =(cid:18) e s

e a

 (cid:19)

(d.3)

where a again labels the nine-dimensional tangent space and s the two-
 , of t 2 may be chosen,
dimensional tangent space (s = 1, 2). the zweibein, e s
in a special lorentz frame, to be

(d.4)

symplectic reparametrizations of the torus act as sl(2, ir) matrices from the
left and local lorentz transformations act as so(2) transformations from the
right. the condition that the zweibein remains in the frame (d.4) leads to
the standard sl(2, zz) transformation of the complex structure of the torus
(which is (c.24) with  replaced by ) and induces a specic -dependent u (1)
transformation on the fermions.

the spin- 1

2 components of the compactied gravitino are written in a com-
plex basis z = x11 + ix9, z = x11  ix9, as z = 11 + i9 and z = 11  i9.
to relate these 32-component spinors to  and  of the iib theory we shall rst
organize them into eigenstates of the u (1) rotations of the compact t 2 generated
by i119/2 + jvec, where jvec acts on the vector index so that jvecz = z and

70

jvecz = z. those components of the spin connection that have tangent-
space indices in the compact directions are given by

z,z =

i

z,z =

(d.5)

the type iib complex scalar eld is identied with  so the quantities p =
z,z and p = z,z correspond to the elds with the same symbol dened
in appendix c. the third real scalar eld in the nine-dimensional theory is
z,z = 4 ln re
trices. the complex combinations, z = 1
obey

we shall make use of projectors made out of the eleven-dimensional  ma-
2 (11  i9),
(d.6)

2 (11 + i9) and z = 1

b /3 .

2
z = 2

z = 0,

{z, z} = 1.

so that the products

pz = (pz)t = zz =

2

(1  i911),

pz = (pz)t = zz =

1
2

(1 + i911)
(d.7)

(where the superscript t indicates the transpose) are projectors, satisfying

p 2
z = pz,

p 2
z = pz,

pzpz = 0.

(d.8)

the action of these projectors on a 32-component real spinor is to replace
it with a complex sixteen component spinor which is an eigenstate of the u (1)
spin, i119/2. therefore, we may identify the four spin-1/2 fermions of the
nine-dimensional compactied theory with the components,

pzz,
pzz,

pzz,
pzz.

(d.9)

(d.10)

the components (d.9) have u (1) charges + 3
2 , respectively, while the
components (d.10) are a mixture of the states with u (1) charges  1
2 . these
elds are simply related to the spin- 1
2 fermions of the iib theory by converting
 and  (and their complex conjugates) from eigenstates of 11 to eigenstates
of i119. this leads to the identications,

2 and  3

pzz = z,

pzz = z

which gives the eigenstates of 11,

 = (1 + z)pzz,

 = (1 + z)pzz.

where the superscripts  indicate the chirality (the value of 11). similarly,
writing  = 1 + i2 and multiplying (d.11) by (1 + 11) leads to

1 = 9+

9  
11,

2 =

(d.14)

the remaining components, a form the nine-dimensional gravitino after a

shift similar to (d.2),

a = a +

a9(pz  pz).

(d.15)

the relations between the m-theory elds and the iib elds can be conrmed
by comparing the way they behave under supersymmetry transformations.

for completeness the iib fermions can be related to the iia fermions in
a straightforward manner. the spin-1/2 fermions in the iia theory follow by
direct dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity [101]. the nine-
dimensional fermions that arise from the spin- 1

2 elds in ten dimensions are

a = 11 + 9119,

which decomposes into the chiral components,

+
a = +

11  9
9 ,


a = 

11 + 9+

similarly,

which has chiral components

a = 9 + 91111,

a =

a = +

9  9

(d.16)

(d.17)

(d.18)

(d.19)

comparing (d.13) with (d.17) and (d.14) with (d.19) gives the identication
of elds of iia and iib in nine dimensions,

1 = +
a,

2 = 9
a,

2 =

1 = 9+
a,

(d.20)

which are in agreement with the world sheet t-duality rules.
