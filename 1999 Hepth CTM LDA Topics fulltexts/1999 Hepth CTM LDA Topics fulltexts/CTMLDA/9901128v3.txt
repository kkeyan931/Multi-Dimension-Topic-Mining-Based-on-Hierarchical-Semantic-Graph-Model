we present a self-contained study of adhm multi-instantons in su(n) gauge theory, espe-
cially the novel interplay with supersymmetry and the large-n limit. we give both eld- and
string-theoretic derivations of the n = 4 supersymmetric multi-instanton action and collective
coordinate integration measure. as a central application, we focus on certain n-point functions
gn, n = 16, 8 or 4, in n = 4 su(n) gauge theory at the conformal point (as well as on related
higher-partial-wave correlators); these are correlators in which the 16 exact supersymmetric and
superconformal fermion zero modes are saturated. in the large-n limit, for the rst time in any
4-dimensional theory, we are able to evaluate all leading-order multi-instanton contributions
exactly. we nd compelling evidence for maldacenas conjecture: (1) the large-n k-instanton
collective coordinate space has the geometry of a single copy of ads5  s5 . (2) the integra-
tion measure on this space includes the partition function of 10-dimensional n = 1 su(k)
gauge theory dimensionally reduced to 0 dimensions, matching the description of d-instantons
in type iib string theory. (3) in exact agreement with type iib string calculations, at the

k-instanton level, gn = n g8 kn7/2e2ikpd|k d2  fn(x1, . . . , xn), where fn is identical to a

convolution of n bulk-to-boundary supergravity propagators.

introduction

i.1 overview of the paper

the 1/n expansion proposed by t hooft twenty-ve years ago [1] continues to oer the tan-
talizing prospect of a tractable approximation scheme for qcd in which connement is visible
at leading order. although this prospect is still a long way out of reach for qcd itself, the
last year has seen signicant progress in understanding the large-n limit in the more controlled
context of non-abelian gauge theories with extended supersymmetry. in particular, maldacena

3

has conjectured [2] that the large-n limit of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills with gauge
group su(n), at the conformal point of vanishing higgs vevs, is dual to weakly coupled type
iib superstring theory on an ads5  s5 background. this provides a realization of the long-
anticipated connection between the 1/n expansion, which is organized as a sum over feynman
diagrams of dierent topology, on the one hand, and string perturbation theory, which is a sum
over string world-sheets of dierent topology, on the other. in particular, the gauge coupling g
and vacuum angle  of the four-dimensional theory are given in terms of the string parameters
by

g = p4gst = 4e ,

 = 2c(0) .

(1.1)

here gst is the string coupling while c(0) is the expectation value of the ramond-ramond scalar
of type iib string theory. also n appears explicitly, through the relation

where ()1 is the string tension and l is the radius of both the ads5 and s5 factors of the
background.

more generally, there is a precise correspondence between the nite mass string states in an
ads5s5 background and the gauge-invariant composite operators on the yang-mills side, and
hence, a proposed equivalence between all correlators in the two theories that are built from
these operators [38]. in this paper we will focus on a class of such correlators which are known
to receive contributions from all orders in d-instantons, on the superstring side, and from all
orders in yang-mills instantons, on the gauge theory side. moreover, on the superstring side,
these contributions are known to sum to a specic modular form of the complexied coupling
constants  and  , with

below we will calculate these contributions from rst principles in the n = 4 theory at large n.
specically, for each topological number k, we will extract the leading semiclassical contribu-
tion to these correlators. this is the rst time in a four-dimensional theory that the instanton
series has been explicitly evaluated to all orders. our calculation involves a novel interplay
between supersymmetry, the large-n limit, and the multi-instanton formalism of atiyah, drin-
feld, hitchin and manin (adhm) [9]. for each k, we obtain perfect quantitative and qualitative
agreement with the supergravity result, although, as described below, there is an outstanding
puzzle about the diering regimes of validity of the supergravity and gauge theory calcula-
tions. quantitatively, we precisely recover the kth taylor coecient of the predicted modular
form. and qualitatively, we discover how the ten-dimensional ads5  s5 space emerges, in
a surprising way, from the four-dimensional picture: this space describes the geometry of the
subspace of multi-instanton collective coordinates which dominates the path integral in the

4

large-n limit. moreover, the integration measure on this space includes the partition func-
tion of ten-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric su(k) gauge theory dimensionally reduced to
zero dimensions, matching the description of d-instantons in type iib string theory. in our
view, this multi-faceted agreement constitutes compelling circumstantial evidence in favor of
maldacenas conjecture.

an abbreviated account of our calculation was presented in ref. [10]. the present paper
not only presents the calculational details of ref. [10] in a self-contained manner, but several
additional results as well, described below.

let us comment further on both sides of the proposed correspondence. unfortunately, little
is known about the string theory on ads5  s5, even at leading order in perturbation theory,
due to the presence of background ramond-ramond elds. to make progress, it is necessary
to focus on the regime where the radius of curvature of the background is large compared to
the string length scale (i.e., small ) in addition to weak coupling (i.e., small gst). in this case
the iib string theory on ads5  s5 is well approximated by classical iib supergravity in the
same background. on the gauge theory side of the conjecture, per eqs. (1.1)-(1.2), this regime
corresponds to a large-n limit with g2  1 but g2n  1. recall that the t hooft coupling g2n
is the eective expansion parameter of the large-n gauge theory [1]. thus, via maldacenas
conjecture, classical supergravity yields predictions for the strong-coupling behavior of the four-
dimensional theory. stringy and quantum corrections to classical supergravity correspond to
corrections in powers of (g2n)1 and g2, respectively, on the gauge theory side.

on the four-dimensional side, the n = 4 models constitute a particularly interesting class
of quantum eld theories in their own right. for any value of n and of the higgs vevs,
they are nite theories, with vanishing chiral anomaly and -function [11]. they are also the
original setting for olive-montonen duality [12]; consequently, the spectrum of monopoles and
dyons can in some cases be computed exactly [13]. moreover, in the absence of such vevs, the
symmetry group of the theory is enlarged both at the classical and quantum levels: the model
becomes a highly nontrivial superconformal eld theory, in an interesting and ill-understood
non-abelian coulomb phase.

yet apart from the well-studied constraints imposed by superconformal invariance for n  3,
little is known about n-point functions in this model for n > 3, beyond the regime g2n  1
where they are amenable to standard perturbative and/or semiclassical analysis.1 maldacenas
conjecture is of special interest to eld theory, precisely because (at least for large n) it pro-
vides a quantitative means of extrapolating these correlators into a domain where perturbation
theory fails. however this also raises an important problem: it is very hard to nd quantitative
tests of the conjecture against our existing knowledge of the n = 4 theory. one way around
this diculty is to isolate a special class of correlators which are protected against quantum cor-

rections by supersymmetry. the results of a weak coupling calculation can then legitimately be
extrapolated to strong coupling and compared with the corresponding supergravity predictions.

the simplest examples of such supersymmetric nonrenormalization theorems involve two-
and three-point functions of certain chiral primary operators [3, 4, 1417]; these are highly con-
strained by the superconformal invariance of the n = 4 theory and apparently are given exactly
by their classical free eld values. however, experience has shown that many supersymmetric
theories contain a family of correlators which, though similarly protected, are far less trivial.
although the details vary from theory to theory, the characteristic (but not sucient) property
of these correlators is that they contain precisely the correct number of fermions to saturate the
exact zero modes of an instanton. it is well-known that instanton contributions to the infra-red
safe correlators of chiral superelds are protected against further quantum corrections [1821].
classic examples of exact results in n = 1 supersymmetry include instanton derivation of the
aeckdineseiberg superpotential [22, 23] and of the nsvz beta-function [24]. in theories
with eight supercharges (both in d = 4 [19,25,26] and d = 3 [27,28]), the quantities which are
one-loop-exact in each multi-instanton sector are typically four-fermion correlators which come
from the two-derivative/four-fermion terms in a low-energy action. for the three-dimensional
theory with sixteen supercharges studied in [29,30] the relevant correlator is related to an eight-
fermion term in the eective action for which a non-renormalization theorem has recently been
proved [31]. other relevant examples involve the correlators of chiral operators which are the
observables of a topological quantum eld theory obtained by twisting the original supersym-
metric gauge theory (see [32], in particular, for an application to the n = 4 theory, which may
be related to the calculation presented below).

in this paper we will study the analogous correlators in the n = 4 superconformal theory,
although, unlike the previous examples, it is not yet known to what extent these correlators are
constrained by supersymmetry. in particular we will calculate the leading semiclassical contri-
bution of adhm multi-instantons to a sixteen-fermion correlator g16(x1, . . . , x16) in n = 4
supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory at large n [33,34] (see also the review [35]). the number
of fermion insertions is dictated by the sixteen exact zero modes of the instanton which are
protected by the supersymmetric and superconformal invariance of the n = 4 theory with van-
ishing vevs (turning on the vevs reduces this number to eight). in addition, supersymmetry
relates the fermionic correlator g16(x1, . . . , x16) to certain bosonic 8-point and 4-point func-
tions g8(x1, . . . , x8) and g4(x1, . . . , x4) [34] in which the instanton zero modes are saturated,
respectively, by fermion-bilinear and fermion-quadrilinear parts of bosonic elds.

by synthesizing maldacenas conjecture with earlier results [3642] about d-instanton con-
tributions to the iib eective action, banks and green [33] have obtained a closed-form su-
pergravity prediction for the 4-point correlator of the stress-tensor operators in the n = 4
superconformal yang-mills theory. predictions for correlators gn (n = 16, 8 or 4) of related

6

operators2 were obtained in [34]. the gn are expressed in terms of a non-holomorphic modu-
lar form fn(,  ), where the modular group sl(2, z) is the s-duality symmetry group of the
type iib string theory. suggestively, the fn are amenable to a simultaneous taylor expansion
in g2, e2i and e2i . on the supergravity side, this amounts, respectively, to perturbative,
d-instanton, and anti-d-instanton eects. the dictionary (1.1) then suggests that (anti-)d-
instantons are mapped onto yang-mills (anti-)instantons by the correspondence. we stress once
again that the supergravity prediction was derived by assuming large g2n, while the semiclas-
sical instanton calculation presented below is valid only for small g2n. despite this caveat, as
stated earlier, for each topological number k we nd precise accord between our weak-coupling
results and the corresponding d-instanton terms in the banks-green prediction. above, we as-
serted that this agreement for the gn (which extends to the whole tower of kaluza-klein states
of supergravity compactied on s5, see sec. vi.2) constitutes convincing evidence in favor of
maldacenas conjecture. in additionthough this is admittedly circular reasoningit can be
seen as equally compelling circumstantial evidence that a supersymmetric nonrenormalization
theorem does, in fact, apply to these correlators too.

this paper is organized as follows. in the remainder of this introductory section, we outline
the supergravity prediction for the gn (sec. i.2) [33, 34]. in particular, a taylor expansion of
the exact solution reveals a surprising and under-appreciated aspect of the d-instanton moduli
space; namely that at any topological level k, it eectively contains only one copyand not
k copiesof ads5  s5. this is contrary to what one usually expects from the physics of
d-branes: the collective dynamics of a multi-charged conguration of d-branes is described by
a non-abelian u(k) yang-mills theory on the brane world-volume. the coulomb branch of this
gauge theory describes the freedom for the branes to separate from one another. however, it is
more appropriate to interpret the d-instanton contribution to the correlation functions gn, as
being due to a charge k d-instanton bound state. this is due to the surprising fact that the
integrals over the coordinates, which one would ordinarily identify as the relative positions of
the singly-charged d-objects, are actually convergent [3739]. this fact will be seen to play a
similarly crucial role on the yang-mills side of the story, as we elucidate in sec. v. in sec. i.3,
we review the corresponding yang-mills calculation at the one-instanton level, and show how
it matches the supergravity result, both in its space-time dependence [34], and in the overall

coupling strength ()1  n [44]. section i ends with a puzzle: navely, this agreement

appears to be an accident of the one-instanton level, for only at this level does an instanton
eld-strength squared resemble a euclidean supergravity bulk-to-boundary propagator. indeed,
even if a dilute instanton gas approximation were justiedand generally it is notthe k-
instanton yang-mills calculation would naturally lead to k copies of ads5 (i.e., k independent
instanton 4-positions and scale sizes) rather than just one copy as the supergravity side of the
correspondence implies.

2these operators as well as the stress-tensor operator correspond to dierent components of the noether
current supereld associated with the superconformal and chiral su (4) transformations of the n = 4 theory
written down in [34, 43].

7

motivated in part by this puzzle, in sec. ii we rst dene what we mean precisely by
the multi-instanton supermultiplet in the superconformal case and then give a thorough, self-
contained review of multi-instanton calculus in supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory. most of
this review material is borrowed from ref. [45] (written in collaboration with m. slater) and
is included herein for the readers convenience. sections ii.1-ii.4 are devoted to the adhm
construction of the general self-dual gauge eld conguration vn(x) of arbitrary topological
number k [9]. subsequently we esh out the remaining components of the n = 4 instanton
supermultiplet: secs. ii.5-ii.6 review the construction of the four gauginos a
 (x) (a = 1, 2, 3, 4)
[46], and sec. ii.7 reviews the construction of the six adjoint scalars aab(x) [26, 45, 47].3

semiclassical physics requires knowledge, not only of the relevant saddle-point congurations
that dominate a given process (in this case, the multi-instanton supermultiplet of sec. ii), but
also, of how properly to weight these congurations in the path integral. specically, one needs
to construct the weighting factor

where sk

collective coordinate measure. these two quantities are studied in detail in secs. iii and iv,
respectively. sk
inst has a crucial role to play: it is responsible for lifting the non-exact fermion
zero modes, thereby ensuring a nonzero result for the grassmann integrations. for the gauge
group su(n) with n = 4 supersymmetry, the k-instanton adhm conguration has 8kn
adjoint fermion zero modes. as mentioned earlier, precisely sixteen of these modes are exact;
these are saturated by the explicit insertions of the external operators in the correlators gn. the
remaining 8kn  16 lifted modes must be saturated instead by bringing down the appropriate
power of sk
inst in the n = 4 model in a somewhat
indirect way, rst by implementing the supersymmetry algebra directly on the multi-instanton
collective coordinates, and then by requiring that sk
inst be a supersymmetric invariant quantity
(among other properties).

is much more direct, albeit calculationally intensive, and leads to the same result. in brief,
the k-instanton supermultiplet is inserted into the component lagrangian, and the space-time
integrations are carried out explicitly using gausss law. in the absence of higgs vevs, we
nd that sk
inst is a pure fermion quadrilinear term (see eqs. (3.1)-(3.2) below), with one fermion
collective coordinate drawn from each of the four gaugino sectors a = 1, 2, 3, 4.

desitter/superconformal eld theory (ads/cft) correspondence. specically, we consider
n = 4 supersymmetric u(n) gauge theory as realized on a set of n parallel d3-branes. of
course, this is the starting point for the analysis leading to maldacenas conjecture. here, how-
ever, we will not take the large-n supergravity limit which leads to the strong-coupled n = 4
theory, but rather stay at weak coupling and take the ordinary decoupling limit   0 while
keeping g2 and n xed. in fact it is well known that d-instantons located on the d3-branes
are equivalent to yang-mills instantons in the world-volume gauge theory [50, 51]. in a sim-
ilar context, witten has shown that the adhm construction emerges in a natural way from
standard facts about d-branes [52]. this viewpoint turns out to be quite powerful and, in
particular, it provides a simple rederivation of the adhm formalism developed in our previous
papers. while this work was being completed, a paper which has some overlap with sec. iv.2
has appeared [53].

the form of the measure derived in secs. iv.1-iv.2 can be termed the at measure, as the
adhm collective coordinates are integrated over as cartesian variables. however the number
of such integration variables grows with n and one must choose a more appropriate set of
coordinates before a traditional saddle-point approximation can be undertaken. to this end, we
transform to a smaller, gauge-invariant set of collective coordinates, which is done in sec. iv.3.
in the resulting gauge-invariant measure (eq. (4.55) below), the number of integration variables
is independent of n, and only grows with the topological number k. this form of the measure
is then the appropriate starting point for the large-n saddle-point treatment that we develop
beginning in sec. v.

section v has the largest overlap with the preliminary version of our paper, ref. [10]. it is
devoted to marrying the large-n limit, on the one hand, with supersymmetric adhm calculus
on the other. as a warm-up, in sec. v.1 we revisit the one-instanton sector already discussed
in sec. i.3, and develop a formal saddle-point approximation to the gauge-invariant measure
as n  . to leading order in 1/n, the bosonic collective coordinate integration turns out
to be dominated by a ten-dimensional submanifold with the geometry of ads5  s5. thus
we nd the intriguing result that, even at weak coupling, the large-n instanton sees the
metric of the supergravity background. the correspondence between the instanton scale-size
 and the radial direction on ads5 has been previously noted in [34, 54]. indeed the power
of  in the factor d4x d 5 which enters the measure (with xn the instanton 4-position) is
forced by the scale invariance of the n = 4 model, and necessarily agrees with the volume
form of the conformally invariant space ads5. rather, the main novelty in our analysis is the
explanation of the s5 : it arises from a scalar eld a transforming in the vector representation
of the so(6) r-symmetry which is introduced in order to bilinearize the fermion quadrilinear
action sk
inst. in particular, as n  , the a variables are increasingly peaked around an s5
subspace of r6. the use of such auxiliary gaussian variables is familiar from the standard
large-n treatment of theories with fermions in the fundamental representation of su(n), such
as the gross-neveu model [55]. it is remarkable that they are not just mathematical artifacts,

9

but play such a central role in the ads/cft correspondence. in fact, as explained in section
iv.2, these auxiliary elds have their origin as the gauge elds of a six-dimensional u(k) gauge
theory whose dimensional reduction describes k d-instantons in the presence of d3 branes.

sections v.2-v.3 extend the saddle-point method to the k-instanton case. in sec. v.2 we
solve the coupled saddle-point equations at the strictly classical level, i.e., neglecting (unjusti-
ably) the prefactor contribution due to small uctuations. in this simple approximation scheme,
we nd that the k instantons live in mutually commuting su(2) subgroups of the su(n) gauge
group, and are described by k independent copies of ads5  s5. this is the puzzle discussed
earlier, and it has to be reconciled with the supergravity side of the correspondence. the puzzle
is resolved in sec. v.3, in which the small uctuations are carefully taken into account. these
generate a singular attractive eective potential which draws the k instantons to a common
point, thereby reducing the moduli space to a single copy of ads5  s5, precisely as required
by the ads/cft correspondence. (however the k instantons remain in mutually commuting
su(2)s.) and there is a further surprise: the lagrangian which describes small uctuations in
the vicinity of this reduced moduli space turns out to be identical to ten-dimensional n = 1
supersymmetric su(k) yang-mills theory, dimensionally reduced to 0 + 0 dimensions. the
collective coordinate k-instanton-measure thus factorizes into the measure on ads5  s5 times
the partition function zk for this su(k) theory. thus, the k-instanton semiclassical measure,
r dk
inst, in the n = 4 yang-mills theory is reduced to the partition function of the
multi-d-instanton matrix model. we then use the recent explicit evaluation of zk [5658] to
complete the specication of the eective large-n k-instanton measure; the nal expression is
given in eq. (5.45). intriguingly, this matrix model is precisely the one posited by ref. [59] as
a denition of type iib string theory.

phys exp sk

in sec. v.4 we comment further on zk. in particular, it is remarkable that zk is precisely
the partition function that describes k-d-instantons in at space [3739]. it is also noteworthy
how, having started with an su(n) gauge theory, one ends up with an su(k) gauge theory;
this type of duality is well known from a string theory context [5052], and is apparent from
our discussion in sec. iv.2. we also discuss the expected relation between zk and the euler
character of the charge-k adhm moduli space.

in sec. vi we use this large-n eective measure to evaluate the correlators of interest.
section vi.1 is devoted to the correlators gn, with n = 16, 8 or 4; as advertised above, we nd
exact agreement with the supergravity prediction of [34]. however the n insertions in these
correlators all correspond, on the supergravity side, to elds which have no dependence on s5,
i.e. which are s-wave. as such, they do not probe this part of the string theory background.
accordingly, in sec. vi.2 we extend the analysis to correlators corresponding to supergravity
elds which are higher partial waves on s5, i.e. massive kaluza-klein modes on s5, and verify
the proposed ads/cft correspondence for a tower of such operators. this analysis highlights
the novel role played by the auxiliary scalar variables a in our formalism.

10

section vii contains some concluding thoughts. section vii.1 gives a slanted historical
overview of the adhm multi-instanton program: largely stymied in nonsupersymmetric appli-
cations due to the intractability of the nonlinear constraints and the lack of knowledge of the
measure; recently rejuvenated in the context of supersymmetric theories; and, as the present
paper demonstrates, simplied even more dramatically in the large-n limit. and sec. vii.2
briey discusses the source of both 1/n corrections and (despite the aforementioned nonrenor-
malization theorem) g2 corrections to the yang-mills calculations.

i.2 review of the superstring prediction

before we describe in detail the superstring prediction, some general comments are in order. as
we have alluded to in the last section, maldacenas conjecture [2] relates type iib supergravity
on ads5  s5 to the large-n limit of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory in four dimen-
sions. the renement of this correspondence presented in [3, 4] identies the n = 4 theory as
living on the four-dimensional boundary of ads5. in particular, each chiral primary operator
o in the boundary conformal eld theory is identied with a particular kaluza-klein mode
of the supergravity elds which we denote as o. the generating function for the correlation
functions of o is then given in terms of the supergravity action siib[o] according to

(cid:28)exp z d4x jo(x)o(x)(cid:29) = expsiib [o; j] .

(1.5)

the iib action on the right-hand side of the equation is evaluated on a conguration which
solves the classical eld equations subject to the condition o(x) = j(x) on the four-dimensional
boundary.

in most applications considered so far, the relation (1.5) has primarily been applied at the
level of classical supergravity, which corresponds to n  , with g2n xed and large, in
the boundary theory [3, 4, 14, 15, 6069]. however, the full equivalence of iib superstrings on
ads5  s5 and n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory conjectured in [2] suggests that (1.5)
should hold more generally, with quantum and stringy corrections to the classical supergravity
action corresponding to g2 and 1/g2n corrections in the n = 4 theory, respectively. the
particular comparison that concerns us here is between yang-mills instanton contributions to
the correlators of o generated by the left-hand side of (1.5) and d-instanton corrections to
the iib eective action on the right-hand side. for future reference, the standard metric on
ads5  s5, in coordinates x = (xn, , ), is given as,

ds2 = gdxdx =

(1.6)

here,  is a unit so(6) vector denoting a point on the unit 5-sphere. the four-dimensional
theory in question lives on the boundary of ads5 which is located at  = 0.

2 (cid:0)dxndxn + d2(cid:1) + d 2 .

11

the relevant d-instanton contributions arise as ()3 corrections [33] to the classical iib
theory on ads5  s5. in particular, as in more conventional eld theory settings, the correc-
tions take the form of instanton-induced vertices in a local eective action. the d-instanton
contribution to an n-point correlator gn comes from a tree level feynman diagram with one
vertex, located at some point (xn, , ) in the bulk of ads5  s5. the diagram also has n
external legs corresponding to operator insertions on the boundary. the position-space feyn-
man rules associate an overall constant with the vertex and a bulk-to-boundary propagator,
to be described below, with each external leg [3, 4, 61]. the selection rule which species the
necessary fermionic insertions is conveniently encoded by integrating over grassmann variables
 which correspond to the sixteen supersymmetries of the iib theory which are broken by the
d-instanton. these variables are associated to the sixteen supersymmetric and superconformal
zero modes of an instanton conguration on the yang-mills side. the nal amplitude is then
obtained by integrating over the position of the vertex on ads5  s5. hence the combined
bosonic and fermionic integration measure for the vertex is ,

z g d10x d16 =z d4x d

5

d5  d16 .

(1.7)

for instance, the bulk-to-boundary propagator for an so(6) singlet scalar free eld of mass m
on ads5 is,

k(x, ; x, 0) =



(2 + (x  x)2) ,

(1.8)

where (ml)2 = (  4).

we now turn in detail to the iib superstring prediction [33] (closely following the more
detailed treatment in [34]). in [36], green and gutperle conjectured an exact form for certain
non-perturbative (in gst) corrections to certain terms in the type iib supergravity eective
action. in the present application, where the string theory is compactied on ads5  s5, it is
important for the overall consistency of the banks-green prediction that the non-perturbative
terms in the eective action do not alter the ads5  s5 background, since the latter is confor-
mally at [33]. in particular, at leading order beyond the einstein-hilbert term in the derivative
expansion, the iib eective action is expected to contain a totally antisymmetric 16-dilatino
eective vertex of the form [40, 42]

()1z d10xpdetg e/2 f16(,  ) 16 + h.c.

(1.9)

here  is a complex chiral so(9, 1) spinor, and f16 is a certain weight (12,12) modular form
under sl(2, z). at the same order in the derivative expansion there are other terms related to
(1.9) by supersymmetry and involving other modular forms [4042] and, in particular, fn(,  ),
with n = 8 and 4. this modular symmetry is precisely s-duality of the type iib superstring,
and although this does not completely determine the modular forms fn, for the n = 4 term

12

green and gutperle [36] were strongly attracted to the following conjecture, later proved in
ref. [70] and generalized to n 6= 4 in [41, 42]:
fn(,  ) = (im )3/2 x(p,q)6=(0,0)

(p + q )n11/2(p + q )n+5/2.

(1.10)

these rather arcane expressions turn out to have the right modular properties, i.e. weight
(n  4,n + 4), and also have very suggestive weak coupling expansions [36, 37, 40, 42]:

the summation over d in (1.12) runs over the positive integral divisors of k. notice that, having
taken into account the conjectured correspondence (1.1) to the couplings of four-dimensional
yang-mills theory, the expansion (1.11) has the structure of a semiclassical expansion: the
rst two terms correspond to the tree and one-loop pieces, while the sum on k is interpretable
as a sum on yang-mills instanton number, the rst and second terms in the square bracket
being instantons and anti-instantons, respectively (this is dictated by the  dependence). each
of these terms includes a perturbative expansion around the instantons, although notice that
the leading order anti-instanton contributions are suppressed by a factor of g4n16 (so not
suppressed for n = 4) relative to the leading order instanton contributions.

in the present paper, our focus will be on the leading semiclassical contributions to the fn;
by this we mean, for each value of the topological number k, the leading-order contribution in
g2. for f16 and f8 the leading semiclassical contributions come from instantons only and have
the form

(1.14)

neglecting g2 corrections. for the special case of f4 there is an identical anti-instanton contri-
bution with i  i . later, we shall nd it very signicant that e/2fn has a dependence
on the instanton number of the form kn7/2. in type iib superstring theory, the terms in the

13

square bracket in (1.12), which are non-perturbative in the string coupling, are interpreted as
being due to d-instantons.

from the eective vertex (1.9) one can construct greens functions g16(x1, . . . , x16) for

sixteen dilatinos (xi), 1  i  16, which live on the boundary of ads5:

in these expressions the xi are four-dimensional space-time coordinates for the boundary of
ads5 while  is the fth, radial, coordinate. the quantity t16 in eq. (1.15) is (in the notation
of ref. [34]) a 16-index antisymmetric invariant tensor which enforces fermi statistics and
ensures, inter alia, that precisely 8 factors of 1/25 and 8 factors of 1/2n are picked out
in the product over k f
7/2. related by supersymmetry to g16, are correlation functions g8
and g4 which have an analogous structure to (1.15), but involving dierent bulk-to-boundary
propagators and with overall factors that we can summarize as

gn  ()1e/2fn(,  ) .

(1.18)

notice that there is no explicit dependence in these expressions on the coordinates on s5;
in particular, the propagator does not depend on them (save through an overall multiplicative
factor which we drop). this is because g16, g8 and g4 are correlators of operators whose
supergravity associates are constant on s5. in sec. vi.2 below, after we have elucidated the
meaning of the s5 in the four-dimensional picture, we will broaden the discussion to include
operators that correspond to elds on the supergravity side that vary over s5, and verify that
the correct dependence on these coordinates ensues.

notice further that in the expression (1.15), the ve-dimensional space-time dependence does
not mix in any way with the  dependence, where the latter is carried solely by the modular
form f16. in particular this means that for arbitrary topological charge k, the d-instanton
contribution to g16 only contains a single copyand not k copiesof ads5, as evinced by the
single copy of the d4x d 5 volume form in eq. (1.15). the rational for this, as we alluded
to earlier, is that when only 16 fermion zero-modes are saturated, as is apparent in the term in
the eective action (1.9), it is more appropriate to think of a conguration of k d-instantons

14

as a single charged k bound state since the integrals over the relative positions are actually
convergent [3739]. however, it will be an interesting challenge (successfully resolved in sec. v.3
below) to reproduce this feature from the yang-mills side, rather than k distinct copies which
one would normally expect from a dilute instanton gas approximation (if it could be justied).
beyond this qualitative agreement, it is the principal goal of this paper to demonstrate that
the identical expression for g16 emerges from the gauge theory side of the correspondence, to
leading semiclassical order (meaning, for each topological number k, to leading order in g2).
but before developing the adhm machinery necessary to treat the case of general k, let us
review the rather simpler situation for k = 1.

i.3 review of the yang-mills calculation at the one-instanton level

according to maldacenas conjecture, the correlator (1.15) in the iib theory should correspond
to a certain 16-fermion correlator in four-dimensional large-n supersymmetric yang-mills the-
ory. the fermion operator in the four-dimensional yang-mills picture with the right transforma-
tion properties to correspond to the dilatino is the gauge-invariant composite operator [3,4,34]

a

 = g2mn 

 trn vmn a
 ,

(1.19)

which is a spin-1/2 fermionic component of the supereld noether current detailed in [34, 43].
here vmn is the su(n) gauge eld strength while the a
 are the weyl gauginos, with the index
a = 1, 2, 3, 4 labeling the four supersymmetries. the numerical tensor mn projects out the
self-dual component of the eld strength,4 so that, at leading order, only instantons rather than
anti-instantons can contribute.

to begin to see how, in the yang-mills picture, a 16-point correlator of the operator (1.19)
might possibly reproduce the structure of eq. (1.15), let us recall the suggestive observation
made by [34]. these authors focused on the one-instanton sector of n = 4 supersymmetric
yang-mills theory with gauge group su(2). in this particularly transparent case, the single
instanton contains precisely sixteen adjoint fermion zero modes: a supersymmetric plus a su-
perconformal zero mode, each of which is a weyl 2-spinor, times four supersymmetries. a
non-vanishing 16-fermion correlator is therefore obtained by saturating each of the fermion in-
sertions with a distinct such zero mode. the semiclassical yang-mills calculation then proceeds
by replacing vmn in the composite operator (1.19) by the standard one-instanton eld strength
vmn(x  x), with x the center of the instanton; likewise for a
 one substitutes into eq. (1.19)
the well-known expression for the gaugino:5

a

 (x) = (cid:0)a

4we use wess and bagger conventions throughout [72], continued to euclidean space via (x0, ~x)  (x0, i~x),
with nmanam  anan, except that our convention for integrating weyl spinors is r d2 2 = 2, rather than

wess and baggers 1.

we therefore nd for the one-instanton contribution to the 16-fermion correlator in n = 4

here, the power of  in the integration measure is xed by the fact that the n = 4 model has
vanishing -function; the power of g comes from combining the explicit dependence in eq. (1.23)
with factors of g8 and g16 from the bosonic and fermionic integrations, respectively [73]; and
c2 is an overall numerical constant.

(1.23)

(1.24)

as the authors of ref. [34] point out, the space-time dependence of the one-instanton yang-
mills expression (1.24) precisely matches the supergravity expression (1.15). indeed, performing
the sixteen grassmann integrations over a
 and  a in eq. (1.24) produces (by denition) the
totally antisymmetric tensor t16 tied into sixteen propagators k f
7/2. furthermore, the remaining
integration measure for the ve bosonic collective coordinates {, xn} in eq. (1.24) is identical
to the volume form of ads5 that appears in eq. (1.15); there, the scale-size  is re-interpreted
as the inverse of the radial position of the d-instanton in ads5 [34, 54].

beyond the spatial dependence, one also nds agreement at the one-instanton level in the
overall strength of the couplings in front of the two expressions. on the supergravity side, from
eqs. (1.11)-(1.15) one extracts the one-instanton prefactor

()1 e/2 f16(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)1-inst  g24 e82/g2+i n ,

up to an overall numerical constant. this g dependence is already present in the yang-mills
expression (1.24) [34]. reproducing this n dependence, too, means generalizing the above
yang-mills calculation from su(2) to su(n), which was done in ref. [44]. in n = 4 su(n)
gauge theory a single instanton has a total of 8n adjoint fermion zero modes so that for n > 2

(1.25)

16

there are additional zero modes beyond the sixteen a
 and  a modes which must be lifted in
order to obtain a non-zero result. as in several other cases in three [30] and four [48] dimensions,
this lifting is due to the presence of a specic grassmann quadrilinear term in the instanton
action (see sec. iii below). pulling down 2n  4 powers of this quadrilinear and performing the
grassmann integrations over the lifted modes turns out to be straightforward, and is reviewed
below in sec. v.1. the chief result of ref. [44] is that the yang-mills expression (1.24) continues
to hold for the gauge group su(n), up to the replacement c2  cn where6

in this algebraically nontrivial way, the
overall n dependence predicted by supergravity is recovered in the large-n limit of the gauge
theory. moreover, since

l4

(1.27)

from eqs. (1.1)-(1.2), the explicit form of the 1/n series implied by the exact yang-mills
one-instanton result (1.26) gives an innite number of predictions for corrections in powers of
gst()2 on the iib side of the correspondence.

upon reection, however, one might suspect that the agreement described above between
the supergravity and yang-mills expressions for g16 is an accident of the one-instanton sector.
for, only in that sector is the instanton action density trn v2
mn proportional to the propagator
k4, as per eq. (1.21). as reviewed in sec. ii.1 below, for topological number k the instanton
action density is a rational function of x whose denominator generically involves a polynomial
in x of degree 2k, raised to a power. in particular, this means that for k > 1, the k-instanton
density generically looks nothing like a classical propagator. one plausible way around this
problem is to posit that the dilute instanton gas approximation somehow becomes valid in the
yang-mills k-instanton calculation. if this were the case, however, the k-instanton density would
resemble a sum of k distinct one-instanton densities (hence a sum of supergravity propagators).
moreover, the moduli space would generically contain k distinct copies (rather than a single
copy) of ads5, meaning integrations over k distinct instanton 4-positions and sizes. in other
words, even if the dilute instanton gas approximation were valid, the k-instanton yang-mills
expression for k > 1 can reasonably be expected to look nothing like the supergravity result
(1.15)!

actually we will nd below that precisely the right propagator-like structure of the instanton
density, accompanied by the collapse of k copies of ads5 to just one copy, is recovered in the
yang-mills calculation as n  . this is one of several pleasing simplications that occur in
the multi-instanton formalism when one passes to the large-n limit.

6the constant cn diers by a factor of 28 from that quoted in [44]. the dierence is due to the present

conventions of footnote 4 for integrating weyl spinors.

17

ii the n = 4 multi-instanton supermultiplet

we now review the formalism of adhm instantons, suitably supersymmetrized. there are
two philosophically distinct ways to introduce the multi-instanton supermultiplet. one way
is to view it as the exact solution of the coupled classical euler-lagrange equations in eu-
clidean space; in the absence of all higgs vevs such exact solutions do of course exist. our
ultimate goal, however, is not just to nd classical solutions, but rather to calculate their quan-
tum contributions to correlators gn, which includes the eects of a perturbative expansion in
the instanton background. an ecient and elegant way to take the leading perturbations into
account automatically is to modify the background conguration itself as explained below; how-
ever, the instanton supermultiplet is then no longer an exact solution to the coupled equations
of motion. this is the essence of the second approach which we follow in this paper.

the key distinction between the two methods is whether or not all of the fermion zero
in n = 4 su(n) gauge theory there
modes are included in the multi-instanton multiplet.
are 8kn fermion zero modes of the covariant weyl operator /d = ndn in the background of
the gauge-eld instanton of topological charge k. however, most of these are at directions
of the action only at the gaussian level and are lifted when the action is expanded to higher
order in uctuations. the zero modes which remain exact to all orders are those protected
by symmetry, namely the eight supersymmetric and eight superconformal fermion zero modes
(2.53a)-(2.53b). if one insists on working with only exact solutions, then only these sixteen
fermion modes can be included in the multi-instanton super-multiplet; the k-instanton action
is then simply a constant, 82k/g2  ik. the remaining 8kn  16 fermion zero modes are
lifted and are treated in this method as uctuations around the background. if one nevertheless
attaches grassmann collective coordinates to the lifted modes, one nds that the resulting k-
instanton eective action will depend on these collective coordinates. in particular there will
be a grassmann quadrilinear term (eq. (3.2) below) generated by scalar exchange through
the yukawa couplings; since this is a tree-level diagram it is not forbidden by a perturbative
nonrenormalization theorem.

instead, in the alternative approach adopted here, we will include all 8kn dirac operator
fermion zero modes in the multi-instanton super-multiplet from the outset. the aforementioned
scalar exchange tree graph is then already built in at the classical level, so that the quadrilinear
action (3.2) is generated without our having to calculate separate diagrams. however, in this
more ecient approach, the coupled euler-lagrange equations must be solved iteratively, order
by order in g; this is not surprising since the multi-instanton conguration is no longer an
exact solution.
in this way, our denition of the multi-instanton supermultiplet is similar
to the more general case of the instanton calculus in the non-conformal cases developed in
[26,45,47,48]. recall that for a non-zero vev non-trivial exact solutions of the coupled euler-
lagrange equations cannot exist and instead one is instructed to solve constrained equations [74]
iteratively in g; the two formalisms are the same in the vev 0 limit.

18

as stated earlier, in this paper we restrict our attention to leading semiclassical order,
meaning the rst non-vanishing order in g at each topological level. for convenience we will
rescale all the elds so that the only g dependence in the action is through the overall coecient
g2; the explicit g dependence in the euler-lagrange equations can be trivially restored by
undoing this rescaling.

the hallmark of adhm calculus is that, with the correct ansatz for the classical component
elds, their dening euler-lagrange equations are mapped into nite-dimensional matrix equa-
tions. thus, for the gauge eld vm(x), the yang-mills equation (a nonlinear dierential equa-
tion) is mapped into the nonlinear adhm constraint equations (2.15a)-(2.15c) below. similarly,
for the classical gauginos a
 (x), the covariant weyl equation (a linear homogeneous dierential
equation) is mapped into the homogeneous linear constraint equations (2.50a)-(2.50b) below.
and nally, for the classical adjoint higgs elds aab(x), the covariant klein-gordon equation
with a yukawa source term (an inhomogeneous linear dierential equation) is mapped into the
inhomogeneous linear constraint equation (2.72) below. note that at leading semiclassical or-
der, the anti-gauginos  a(x) and the auxiliary supereld components f and d are all turned
o; they do, however, turn on at a higher order in g, in the process of solving by iteration the
coupled approximate euler-lagrange equations.

ii.1 construction of the classical gauge eld

in secs. ii.1-ii.4 we concern ourselves with pure su(n) gauge theory, without fermions or
scalars. gauge elds vm are traceless anti-hermitian n  n matrices and

vmn = mvn  nvm + [vm, vn]

(2.1)

is the eld-strength. the adhm multi-instanton is the general solution of the self-duality
equation

in the sector of topological number (equivalently, winding or instanton number) k, where

vmn = vmn  1

2mnklvkl

k = 

1

162z d4x trn vmn vmn .

(2.2)

(2.3)

the adhm construction of such multi-instantons is discussed in refs. [9, 46, 75, 76]. here we
follow, with minor modications, the su(n) formalism of refs. [45, 46].

the basic object in the adhm construction is the (n + 2k)  2k complex-valued matrix

19

[n+2k][2k] which is taken to be linear in the space-time variable xn :7

[n+2k][2k] (x)  [n+2k][k][2] (x) = a[n+2k][k][2] + b[n+2k][k][2] x[2][2] .

(2.4)

here we have represented the [2k] index set as a product of two index sets [k]  [2] and have
used a quaternionic representation of xn,

x[2][2] = x  = xn n

  .

(2.5)

it follows that n = bn. by counting the number of bosonic and fermionic zero modes, we
will soon verify that k in eq. (2.4) is indeed the instanton number while n is the parameter in
the gauge group su(n). as discussed below, the complex-valued constant matrices a and b in
eq. (2.4) constitute a (highly over complete) set of k-instanton collective coordinates.

for generic x, the null-space of the hermitian conjugate matrix (x) is n-dimensional, as
it has n fewer rows than columns. the basis vectors for this null-space can be assembled into
an (n + 2k)  n dimensional complex-valued matrix u(x),

[2k][n+2k] u[n+2k][n] = 0 = u[n][n+2k] [n+2k][2k] ,

where u is orthonormalized according to

u[n][n+2k] u[n+2k][n] = 1[n][n] .

(2.6)

(2.7)

in turn, the classical adhm gauge eld vm is constructed from u as follows. note rst that
for the special case k = 0, the antisymmetric gauge conguration vn dened by

vn[n][n] = u[n][n+2k] n u[n+2k][n ]

(2.8)

is pure gauge (i.e., it is a gauge transformation of the vacuum), so that it automatically
solves the self-duality equation (2.2) in the vacuum sector. the adhm ansatz is that eq. (2.8)
continues to give a solution to eq. (2.2), even for nonzero k. as we shall see, this requires the
additional condition

[2][k][n+2k] [n+2k][k][2] = 1[2][2] f1

[k][k] ,

(2.9)

where f is an arbitrary x-dependent k  k dimensional hermitian matrix.

to check the validity of the adhm ansatz, we rst observe that eq. (2.9) combined with

the null-space condition (2.6) imply the completeness relation

p[n +2k][n +2k]  u[n+2k][n]

u[n][n+2k]

= 1[n+2k][n+2k]  [n+2k][k][2] f[k][k]

[2][k][n+2k] .

(2.10)

7for clarity, in sec. ii we will occasionally show matrix sizes explicitly, e.g. the su (n ) gauge eld will
[n ][n ]. to represent matrix multiplication in this notation we will underline contracted indices:

be denoted vm
(ab)[a][c] = a[a][b] b[b][c]. also we adopt the shorthand x [myn] = xmyn  xnym.

20

note that p, as dened, is actually a projection operator; the fact that one can write p in
these two equivalent ways turns out to be a useful trick in adhm algebra, used pervasively
below. with the above relations together with integrations by parts, the expression for the
eld strength vmn may be massaged as follows:
vmn   [mvn] + v [mvn] =  [m( u n]u) + ( u [mu)( u n]u) =  [m u (1  u u )n]u

=  [m uf n]u = u [mf n] u = u b[mn]fbu = 4 ubmnfbu .

(2.11)

self-duality of the eld strength then follows automatically from the well-known self-duality
property of the numerical tensor mn, dened by [72]

mn = 1




4 (m  

n  n   

m ) .

(2.12)

a technical point: the above construction does not actually distinguish between the gauge group
u(n) and su(n), i.e., the classical gauge eld constructed in this way is not automatically
traceless (unlike the eld strength). however, it can be made so by a gauge transformation
u  ug, where g  u(1).

already at this stage we can infer the behavior of trn v2

mn as a rational function of x. from
eq. (2.9) we see that the k  k matrix f1 is a quadratic polynomial in x. consequently
the denominator of f itself is a polynomial in x of degree 2k (i.e., like detf1); the denom-
inator of trn v2
mn then generically goes like the fourth power of this polynomial, as follows
from eqs. (2.10)-(2.11). this explains our comments at the end of sec. i.3, that only at the
one-instanton level can this quantity look like a classical supergravity propagator, which only
involves quadratic forms in the denominator. we will see in sec. v below how this pessimistic
observation is averted when the adhm formalism is combined with the large-n limit.

in the next subsection we will count the independent degrees of freedom of the adhm
conguration and conrm that it has precisely the number of collective coordinates needed to
describe a k-instanton solution.

ii.2 constraints, collective coordinates and canonical forms

we have seen that the adhm construction for su(n) makes essential use of matrices of various
sizes: (n + 2k)  n matrices u, (n + 2k)  2k matrices , a and b, k  k matrices f , and
2  2 matrices n
 , n , x , etc. (notice that when n = 2, the dimensionalities of u and 
dier from the su(2) as sp(1) formalism reviewed in ref. [26].) accordingly, we introduce

21

a variety of index assignments:

instanton number indices [k] :

color indices [n] :

adhm indices [n + 2k] :

quaternionic (weyl) indices [2] :

lorentz indices [4] :

1  i, j, l     k
1  u, v     n
1  ,      n + 2k
, , ,     = 1, 2
m, n   = 0, 1, 2, 3

no extra notation is required for the 2k dimensional column index attached to , a and b, since
it can be factored as [2k] = [k]  [2] = j , etc., as in eq. (2.4). with these index conventions,
eq. (2.4) reads

 i (x) = a i  + b

 i x  ,

while the factorization condition (2.9) becomes

 

i (x) = a 

i + x  b

i ,




i  j  = 


 (f1)ij .

(2.13)

(2.14)

combining eqs. (2.13)-(2.14), and noting that fij(x) is arbitrary, one extracts the three x-
independent conditions on a and b:

 ,

a 
i aj  = ( 1
j = b
b
a 
i
b
i b
j = ( 1

2 aa)ij  
i a 
bb)ij  
 .

j ,

2

(2.15a)

(2.15b)

(2.15c)

these three conditions are known as the adhm constraints [46, 75]. they dene a set of
coupled quadratic conditions on the matrix elements of a, a, b and b. as such, for k > 3, they
cannot be solved in closed form in terms of algebraic functions. this unfortunate fact is the
single biggest historical impediment that has hindered progress in multi-instanton calculus.

the elements of the matrices a and b comprise the collective coordinates for the k-instanton
gauge conguration. clearly the number of independent such elements grows as k2, even after
accounting for the constraints (2.15a)-(2.15c). in contrast, the number of physical collective
coordinates should equal 4kn which scales linearly with k. 8 it follows that a and b constitute
a highly redundant set. much of this redundancy can be eliminated by noting that the adhm
construction is unaected by x-independent transformations of the form

[n+2k][k][2]  [n+2k][n+2k] [n+2k][k][2] b1

[k][k] ,

u[n+2k][n]  [n+2k][n+2k] u[n+2k][n] ,

f[k][k]  b[k][k] f[k][k] b[k][k] ,

(2.16)

8to see this, consider the limit of k far-separated (distinguishable) instantons; each individual instanton is
then described by four positions, one scale size, and 4n  5 iso-orientations, totaling 4n collective coordinates.
usually, as in [75, 77], the number of collective coordinates of the k-instanton is quoted as 4kn  n 2 + 1 for
k  n/2 and 4k2 + 1 for k < n/2. these formulae represent only true collective coordinates, that is, excluding
the global gauge rotations of the k-instanton conguration. in contrast, in our counting we include such global
rotations since they appear in our k-instanton measure. then the total number of collective coordinates is 4kn .

22

provided   u(n + 2k) and b  gl(k, c). (these are in addition to the usual space-time
gauge symmetries reviewed in sec. 6 of [26].) exploiting these symmetries, one can choose a
representation in which b assumes a simple canonical form [46]:

b[n+2k][2k] = (cid:18)0[n][2k]

1[2k][2k](cid:19) ,

a[n+2k][2k] = (cid:18)w[n][2k]

a[2k][2k](cid:19) .

(2.17)

we can make this canonical form a little more explicit with a convenient representation of

the index set [n + 2k]. we decompose each adhm index   [n + 2k] into9

 = u + l ,

1  u  n ,

1  l  k ,

 = 1, 2 .

(2.18)

in other words, the top n 2k submatrices in eq. (2.17) have rows indexed by u  [n], whereas
the bottom 2k  2k submatrices have rows indexed by the pair l  [k]  [2]. equation (2.17)
then becomes

a i  = a(u+l) i  = (cid:18) wu i 

i = a  (u+l)
a 

i

b
 i = b

i = bu+l
b

(a )li(cid:19) ,
iu , (a )il(cid:1) ,
 li(cid:19) ,
 il(cid:1) .

= (cid:0) w 
(u+l) i = (cid:18) 0
i = (cid:0)0 ,  

 

(2.19a)

(2.19b)

(2.19c)

(2.19d)

with a and b in the canonical form (2.19a), the third adhm constraint of (2.15c) is satised
automatically, while the remaining constraints (2.15a) and (2.15b) boil down to:

tr2  caa = 0

(an) = an .

(2.20a)

(2.20b)

in eq. (2.20a) we have contracted a a  with the three pauli matrices ( c) 

we have decomposed (a )li and (a )il in our usual quaternionic basis of spin matrices:

, while in eq. (2.20b)

(a )li = (an)li n

  ,

(a )il = (an)il n  .

(2.21)

note that the canonical form for b given in eq. (2.19a) is preserved by a residual u(k)

subgroup of the u(n + 2k)  gl(k, c) symmetry group (2.16), namely:
0[n][2k] r[2k][2k](cid:19) [n+2k][2k] r[2k][2k]

[n+2k][2k]  (cid:18)1[n][n]

0[2k][n]

(2.22)

9the weyl index  in this decomposition is raised and lowered with the  tensor as always [72], whereas for

the [n ] and [k] indices u and l there is no distinction between upper and lower indices.

23

where r[2k][2k] = rij 
acts as



 and rij  u(k). in terms of w and a, this residual transformation

wui   wuj  rji ,

(a )ij  ril (a )lp rpj .
it follows that the physical moduli space, mk
phys, of inequivalent self-dual gauge congurations in
the topological sector k is the quotient of the space mk of all solutions of the adhm canonical
constraints (2.20a) and (2.20b), by this residual symmetry group u(k):

(2.23)

mk

phys =

mk
u(k)

.

(2.24)

finally we can count the independent collective coordinate degrees of freedom of the adhm
multi-instanton. a general complex matrix a[n+2k][2k] has 4k(n + 2k) real degrees of freedom.
the two adhm conditions (2.20a) and (2.20b) impose 3k2 and 4k2 real constraints, respectively,
while modding out by the residual u(k) symmetry removes another k2 degrees of freedom. in
total we therefore have

4k(n + 2k)  3k2  4k2  k2 = 4kn

(2.25)

real degrees of freedom, precisely as required. of these, the four real degrees of freedom
x  = xnn

  corresponding to

are the translational collective coordinates, as is obvious from eq. (2.13).

ai  = b

i x 

(2.26)

ii.3 asymptotics of the multi-instanton

let us determine the instanton vn more explicitly, in a particularly useful gauge. this entails
solving for u, and hence vn itself via (2.8), in terms of .
it is convenient to make the
decomposition:

u[n+2k][n] = (cid:18) v[n][n]

u[2k][n](cid:19) , [n+2k][2k] = (cid:18) w[n][2k]

[2k][2k](cid:19) .

then from the completeness condition (2.10) one nds

v[n][n]

v[n][n] = 1[n][n]  w[n][k][2] f[k][k] w[2][k][n] .

(2.27)

(2.28)

for any v that solves this equation, one can nd another by right-multiplying it by an x-
dependent u(n) matrix. a specic choice of v corresponds to xing the space-time gauge.
the instanton singular gauges correspond to taking any one of the 2n choices of matrix
square roots:

v = (1  wf w)1/2 .

24

(2.29)

next, u in eq. (2.27) is determined in terms of v via
u = f w v 1

which likewise follows from eq. (2.10).

(2.30)

equations (2.29) and (2.30) determine u in (2.27), and hence the gauge eld vn via eq.
(2.8). we list for later use the leading large-|x| asymptotic behavior of several key adhm
quantities, assuming instanton singular gauge (2.29):

  bx ,

fkl 

1

|x|2 kl ,

u  

1

|x|2 x w ,

v  1[n][n] .

(2.31)

ii.4 connection to the usual one-instanton collective coordinates,

and the dilute instanton gas limit

it is illuminating to compare the adhm collective coordinates contained in the matrix a, to
the more familiar variables describing the instanton position, size, and iso-orientation. let us
rst focus on the one-instanton sector. in particular, let us verify that the usual one instanton
solution [73, 78] follows from the general adhm formalism reviewed above. we adopt the
canonical form (2.19a)-(2.19d) and set the instanton number k = 1, thus dropping the i, j
indices. contrary to the su(2) as sp(1) treatment of ref. [26], now the adhm constraints
(2.20a) and (2.20b) do not disappear in the one-instanton sector. instead, eq. (2.20b) says that
an is real,

after which eq. (2.20a) collapses to

an  xn  r4 ,

w 

u wu  = 2  

 .

(2.32)

(2.33)

the quantities  and xn will soon be identied with the instanton scale size and space-time
position, respectively. it is convenient to put w in the form:

wu  = [n][n] (cid:18)0[n 2][2]

1[2][2] (cid:19) ,

 

su(n)
su(n  2)

.

setting  = 1 initially, we nd for  and f :

[n+2][2] = 
0[n 2][2]
  1[2][2]

y[2][2]


 ,
v[n][n] =  1[n 2][n 2]

with y = (x  x). equations (2.29)-(2.30) then amount to
0
y2+2(cid:17)1/2
(cid:16) y2

0

f =

1

y2 + 2 ,

1[2][2]!

25

(2.34)

(2.35)

(2.36)

and

u[2][n] = (cid:18)0[2][n 2]

, (cid:16)

2

y2(y2+2)(cid:17)1/2

y[2][2](cid:19) .

the gauge eld then follows from eq. (2.8):

vn = (cid:18)0

0

n (cid:19) .

0 vsu (2)

(2.37)

(2.38)

here vsu (2)

vn =  (cid:18)0

0

n (cid:19)  ,

0 vsu (2)

 

su(n)

u(1)  su(n  2)

.

(2.40)

we see that the instanton always lives in an su(2) subgroup of the su(n) gauge group. an
explicit representation of this embedding is formed by the three composite su(2) generators

(tc)uv = 2 wu  ( c) 

 w


v ,

c = 1, 2, 3.

(2.41)

next let us consider the general k-instanton conguration. in order to make contact with
familiar non-adhm collective coordinates, it is necessary to pass to the dilute instanton gas
limit. in adhm language this corresponds to the limit

[an , am]  0  m, n .

(2.42)

note that this condition is invariant under the residual u(k) symmetry (2.23). however,
eq. (2.42) means that there exists a preferred u(k) transformation which simultaneously diag-
onalizes the four an matrices:

with this choice, the individual collective coordinates of the k far-separated instantons are the
obvious analogs of the one-instanton expressions (2.32), (2.33) and (2.41):

an = diag(cid:0)(an)11, . . . , (an)kk(cid:1) .

where the (unsummed) index i = 1, . . . , k labels the individual instantons.

26

ii.5 construction of the adjoint fermion zero modes

in a supersymmetric theory the gauge eld vm is accompanied by a gaugino a, where the index
a runs over the number of independent supersymmetries. in particular, the n = 4 model has
an su(4)r = so(6)r r-symmetry, and the a transform in the fundamental representation of
the su(4)r or equivalently in the spinor representation of the so(6)r.

in the leading semiclassical approximation, the a are replaced by the non-trivial solutions

to the covariant weyl equation in the adhm background,

/da = 0 ,

(2.45)

where /d = ndn. by the index theorem, the zero modes of /d comprise 2kn independent
grassmann degrees of freedom for each supersymmetry. as discussed in [79] in the one-instanton
context, these zero modes can be thought of as the superpartners of the instanton. explicit
expressions for the adjoint fermion zero modes in the adhm background were rst obtained
in [46]. in our notation they read (cf. eq. (7.1) of [26]):

(a

 )uv = u 

ifijb

uma

juv  u 

u bi fij ma

j uv .

(2.46)

i and ma

here ma
are constant (n + 2k)  k and k  (n + 2k) matrices of grassmann
collective coordinates; they can be viewed as either two real grassmann matrices or as two
complex grassmann matrices which are hermitian conjugates of one another.

j

in order to verify that the ansatz (2.46) satises the weyl equation (2.45), we use the general

dierentiation formulae (see eqs. (2.8), (2.10), (2.13) and (2.14) above)

nf = f  n( 1

2

together with

  )  f = (f   

b   f
f   bn   f

n

dn( uj u)  n( uj u) + [vn, uj u]

= u nj u  ubn f  j u  uj  f  

n

valid for any j (x). from eqs. (2.46)-(2.48) we then calculate:

bu ,

(2.47)

(2.48)

(2.49)

/d a

 = 2 ubf(cid:0)  ma + ma (cid:1)fbu .

hence the condition for a gaugino zero mode is the following two sets of linear constraints on
ma and ma which ensure that the right-hand side vanishes (expanding (x) as a + bx) [46]:
(2.50a)

(2.50b)

ma
i aj  = a
j = b
ma

i  ma

i

27

in a formal sense discussed in ref. [45], these fermionic constraints are the spin- 1
2 superpart-
ners of the original spin-1 adhm constraints (2.15a) and (2.15b), respectively. note further
that eq. (2.50b) is easily solved when b is in the canonical form (2.19a). with the adhm index
decomposition (2.18), we set

ma

i  ma

(u+l) i = (cid:18) a

iu , ( ma)il(cid:1) .

(2.51)

(2.52)

which allows us to eliminate ma in favor of ma.

ii.6 classication and overlap formula for the fermion zero modes

let us classify these weyl spinor zero modes. two can be immediately distinguished, namely
those proportional to the adhm matrices a and b. we choose the following linear combinations

i = 4b

i a
 ,

ma

i = 4b

i a

ma

and

i = 4 ai   a  4k1b
ma
 + 4k1b
ma
i = 4a 

i a

itrk(a ) a
itrk(a )a
 ,

(2.53a)

(2.53b)

where a
 and  a are arbitrary spinor parameters. these are the so-called supersymmetric
and superconformal zero modes,10 respectively [79]; they satisfy the fermionic constraints
(2.50a)-(2.50b) by virtue of the adhm constraints (2.15a)-(2.15b).

as for the remaining 8kn16 modes, it is simplest to focus rst on the one-instanton sector,
k = 1, with the instanton oriented as in eqs. (2.35)-(2.38), and with  originally set to unity.
apart from the sixteen modes (2.53a)-(2.53b), there are 8n  16 additional fermionic zero
modes which are the superpartners to gauge orientations [23]. they are constructed by setting
ma = 0 and also a
u for u  n  2; by
inspection, these satisfy the constraints (2.50a)-(2.50b). turning on the orientation matrix 
as in eq. (2.40) simply rotates these choices of ma by .

u = 0 for u = n  1 or n, with arbitrary choices for a

next let us construct these modes for k > 1. our strategy is rst to consider the bosonic
gauge orientation modes, and then to act on them with supersymmetry. by denition, these
orientation modes must preserve all gauge-invariant combinations of the bosonic collective

10subtracting the trace terms in (2.53b), which amounts to an admixture of the supersymmetric mode,
corresponds to performing the superconformal transformation about the center of the multi-instanton, rather
than about the arbitrary origin of space-time.

28

coordinates contained in the matrix a. the (global) gauge dependence of a collective coordinate
is carried by the index u which transforms in the fundamental representation of su(n); this
index is attached to the submatrix w but not to the submatrix a (see eq. (2.19a)). a natural set
of gauge-invariant collective coordinates (used pervasively below) is obtained by constructing
bosonic bilinear variables w in which u is summed over:

(cid:0)w 

(cid:1)ij = w 

iu wuj  , w 0 = tr2 w, w c = tr2  cw, c = 1, 2, 3 .

(2.54)

by denition the innitesimal gauge orientation modes w are the ones which preserve all the
w s, i.e., which satisfy

w 

iuwuj  +  w 

iuwuj  = 0 .

(2.55)

now we consider the fermionic superpartners of these modes. under a supersymmetry trans-
formation one simply has [45]:

wui  = i aa

ui ,

 w 

iu = ia

iu

 
a .

inserting eq. (2.56) into eq. (2.55) produces the gauge-invariant conditions

 a w 

iua

uj +  

a a

iuwuj  = 0

or equivalently,

w 

iua

uj = 0 and a

iuwuj  = 0 .

to satisfy these constraints, it is convenient to decompose a as follows:

iu = wuj ( a)ji + a
a
iu,

where a lies in the orthogonal subspace to w:

iu = ( a
a

 )ij w 

uj + a

iu ,

w 

iua

uj = 0,

a
iuwuj  = 0 .

(2.56)

(2.57)

(2.58)

(2.59)

(2.60)

the superpartners of the bosonic coset coordinates are then precisely the variables {a, a}.11

now let us count the number of fermion modes of these various types. it is easily checked (see
eq. (4.53) below) that the fermionic adhm constraint (2.50a) only involves the {ma,  a,  a}
modes, and not the {a, a} modes. our convention will be to use this constraint to eliminate
the  a in favor of the others. counting real independent grassmann degrees of freedom, we
thus nd 8k2 of the ma modes (which include the eight exact supersymmetric modes (2.53a)),
8k2 of the  a modes (which, linearly combined with the ma modes, include the eight exact
superconformal modes (2.53b)), and 8kn16k2 of the a modes, totaling 8kn. this is precisely
as expected: one initially has 8k(n + 2k) real grassmann parameters in ma and ma, subject

11it is worth mentioning that although the coset coordinates correspond to bosonic zero modes which are

generated by lagrangian symmetries, this is not true of their fermionic partners.

29

to 8k2 constraints from each of eqs. (2.50a) and (2.50b), for a net of 8kn independent real
gaugino zero modes.

finally, we will need the expression for the overlap of two adjoint fermion zero modes.
thanks to the adhm formalism, the space-time integration of the product of two classical
fermion elds can be equated to an ordinary trace over the product of the associated collective
coordinate matrices. the expression to be proved reads:

z d4x trn   = 

2
2

here

trk(cid:2) m(p + 1)n + n (p + 1)m(cid:3) .
|x| p = 2  bb ,

p = lim

(2.61)

(2.62)

as per eqs. (2.10) and (2.31), and m and n are the collective coordinate matrices corresponding
to  and , respectively.

the formula (2.61), attributed in ref. [76] to e. corrigan [80], is proved in a similar way
to the overlap formula for two bosonic vector zero modes presented in appendices b-c of [26].
the strategy of the proof is to show that the integrand is actually a total derivative,

trn   = 1

8 nn trk(cid:2) m(p + 1)n f + n (p + 1)mf(cid:3) ,

after which eq. (2.61) follows from gausss law, together with the asymptotic formulae of
sec. ii.3. to verify this, let us rst write out the left-hand side of eq. (2.63):12

(2.63)

trn   = tr(cid:2) ( npm + mpn )fbpbf + mpbf npbf + pmfbpn fb(cid:3).
we have used the cyclicity of the trace, together with the denition (2.10) for the projector p.
turning to the right-hand side of eq. (2.63), one calculates:
8 nn tr(cid:2) m(p + 1)n f(cid:3) = 1

ii.7 construction of the adjoint higgs bosons

in addition to the gauge eld vm and the four weyl spinors a
 , the n = 4 vector supermultiplet
contains three complex scalars which likewise transform in the adjoint representation of su(n).
in n = 2 language, one of these three complex scalars comes from the n = 2 gauge multiplet
while the other two live in a single adjoint matter hypermultiplet. it is convenient to assemble
these three complex scalars into an adjoint-valued antisymmetric tensor eld aab(x), endowed
with the canonical kinetic energy

1

4abcdz d4x trn dnaabdnacd .

the antisymmetric eld is subject to a specic reality condition:

1

2abcdacd = (aab) ,

(2.67)

(2.68)

where  acts only on gauge indices, which implies that it transforms in the vector 6 represen-
tation of so(6)r. we can transform to explicit vector components via

aab =

1
8

ab

a aa ,

(2.69)

where the coecients ab

are dened in the appendix.

in the leading semiclassical approximation, aab(x) is replaced by the solution of the classical

euler-lagrange equation

d2aab = 2 i [ a , b ] ,

(2.70)

where d2 is the covariant klein-gordon operator in the multi-instanton background, and a
is the adjoint fermion zero mode (2.46). the construction of the solution to this equation for
arbitrary higgs vevs is one of the principal technical results of refs. [26, 45]. here we will
content ourselves to summarize the solution in the exact conformal case of vanishing vevs.

iu wuj  , w 0 = w 0

(2.74)

(2.75)

which we introduced in eq. (2.54). from eqs. (2.72)-(2.75) one sees that aab and ab trans-
form in the adjoint representation of the residual u(k) (2.22) (i.e., like a and ma).

dened in this way, the higgs eld aab(x) correctly satises the equation (2.70); see sec. 7
of ref. [26] for calculational details. we also note that the constraints (2.15a), (2.15b), (2.50a),
(2.50b) and (2.72) may be thought of as the spin-1, spin- 1
2 , and spin-0 components of
an n = 4 supermultiplet of constraints [47, 48].

iii construction of the multi-instanton action

having constructed the gauge, gaugino, and scalar components of the n = 4 superinstanton in
sec. ii, we now derive the k-instanton action sk

inst. the expression we will derive reads [48]:

sk

inst =

82k
g2  ik + sk

quad .

(3.1)

quad is a particular fermion quadrilinear term, with one fermion collective coordinate

here sk
chosen from each of the four gaugino sectors a = 1, 2, 3, 4 :

sk

quad =

2
g2 abcd trk abacd =

2
g2 abcd trk abl1cd ,

(3.2)

13positivity of l follows from the hermiticity of a

n and the fact that w 0 is the product of a (non-square)

matrix with its hermitian conjugate: w 0 = w w .

32

with l as in eq. (2.74). as an important consistency check, note that this expression does not
lift any of the sixteen exact supersymmetric and superconformal zero modes (2.53a)-(2.53b);
indeed, thanks to the constraints (2.50a)-(2.50b) these do not appear in ab. in contrast, the
remaining 8kn 16 fermionic modes do enter into sk
quad, and can therefore be lifted by bringing
down powers of the action from the exponent.

we know of three distinct derivations of eqs. (3.1)-(3.2). the rst, given in ref. [48], is
somewhat indirect, as it uses the supersymmetry properties of the collective coordinates; the
second, presented below, is more straightforward, albeit calculationally intensive. in ref. [48],
we considered the n = 4 model with su(2) gauge group, on the coulomb branch in which an
adjoint higgs vev v breaks the gauge symmetry down to u(1). using methods from previous
work [26, 47] we calculated the fermion bilinear terms in the k-instanton action; they are pro-
portional to either v or v. then we reasoned as follows. it is known that the supersymmetry
algebra can be implemented directly on the (unconstrained) multi-instanton collective coordi-
nates {a,ma} [47, 79]. physical quantities such as the multi-instanton collective coordinate
action should be a supersymmetric invariant. the fermion bilinear terms calculated in ref. [48]
can be shown not to form a supersymmetric invariant expression by themselves. however, the
unique addition of the quadrilinear term (3.2), taken together with the bilinear terms, does pro-
duce a supersymmetric invariant expression. furthermore, in the conformal limit v  0, only
the quadrilinear term survives; in this limit it becomes a supersymmetric invariant by itself.
note that, without rst introducing the vev, we would not have been able to x the overall
multiplicative constant in front of sk
quad using supersymmetry alone. note further that while
the derivation detailed in ref. [48] was only for the gauge group su(2), with the notational
redenitions of [45] it immediately extends to general su(n). an alternative derivation of the
action will be presented in sec. iv.2 below using d-brane methods.

here, instead, we will present a more straightforward derivation of the quadrilinear action
(3.2). our strategy is simply to plug the semiclassical expressions (2.8), (2.46) and (2.71) for
the gauge, gaugino and scalar elds into the n = 4 component lagrangian, and to carry out
the spatial integrations. such a direct approach might appear unpromising, since in general the
functional form of the gauge eld cannot be written down explicitly. (remember that for k > 3
the nonlinear adhm constraints (2.20a) cannot be solved in closed form; see eqs. (2.15a)-
(2.15c) .) however, as in the n = 2 models considered in [26, 47, 81], it turns out that the
integrations can nevertheless be accomplished using gausss law, and that only the asymptotic
expressions (2.31) are actually needed. here are the details.

at leading semiclassical order, the relevant parts of the n = 4 component lagrangian are

33

the gauge, higgs and yukawa terms

abcdz d4x trn aab [c, d] .

(3.3)

as discussed at the opening of sec. ii, the other terms in the component lagrangian, involving
the antifermions , or the auxiliary components f and d, only turn on at higher order in g2 and
can be neglected for present purposes. the rst line in eq. (3.3) yields the usual k-instanton
contribution

sgauge = 2ik =

82k
g2  ik .

(3.4)

with an integration by parts together with the scalar equation of motion (2.70), the last two
terms may be rewritten as

shiggs + syuk = g21bcdz d4x(cid:0) n(trn a1bdnacd) + i2 trn 1[b, acd](cid:1) .

for deniteness we have singled out the supersymmetry index 1; alternatively this and subse-
quent equations may be rewritten in a manifestly su(4)r invariant way. the rst term here,
being a total derivative, may be converted to a surface integral on the sphere at innity. since
it is gauge-invariant we can evaluate it in any convenient gauge. in particular, in the instanton
singular gauge dened in sec. ii.3 above, eqs. (2.31) and (2.71) imply that in the limit |x|  
(3.6)

(3.5)

aab

dnaab

so that this surface contribution vanishes.

we will now show that the commutator term in eq. (3.5) can likewise be rewritten as a
surface term. the general construction parallels that used in ref. [81] for deriving the fermion
quadrilinear in the simpler case of the n = 2 model coupled to fundamental hypermultiplets.
the basic idea is to construct quantities   and  such that

where /d  = n

 dn, and  is itself an adjoint fermion zero mode of the form

  +  ,

()uv = u

juv  u 

u bi fij n 

j uv .

(3.7)

(3.8)

the collective coordinate matrix n (which will be seen to depend in a nontrivial way on the
original collective coordinates {a,ma}) is subject to the usual zero mode conditions from
sec. ii.5:

n 
i aj  = a
j = b
n 
i b

i  nj ,
i nj .

34

(3.9a)

(3.9b)

with the rewrite (3.7), the commutator term in eq. (3.5) becomes

22 iz d4x trn 1( /d 

  + ) = 22 iz d4x n(trn 1n

 

 )

+ 2 i2trk(cid:2) m1(p + 1)n + n (p + 1)m1(cid:3)

(3.10)

in the rst term we have used the fact that /d1 = 0 to pull the derivative outside the trace,
while in the second term we have invoked the zero mode overlap formula (2.61) (which likewise
follows from a surface integration). the reader can verify below a posteriori, using the asymp-
totics of sec. ii.3, that 1  x3 and   x2; hence the rst term on the right-hand side
of eq. (3.10), like its higgs counterpart in eq. (3.5), gives a vanishing contribution at innity
and may be dropped. instead, it is the second term which is entirely responsible for the nal
answer (3.2).

let us return to eq. (3.7), and solve for   and . as usual in adhm calculus, some
educated guesswork is required. to this end we expand the left-hand side, using eqs. (2.46)
and (2.71):

of the type uj u, the chain-rule identity

/d (cid:0) uj u) = u ( / j )u + 2 ubf  j u + 2 uj  fbu

follows trivially from eq. (2.48). since n = bn, a comparison of eqs. (3.11) and (3.12)
motivates the ansatz:

constraints (3.9a)-(3.9b).

by explicit calculation using eqs. (2.47), (2.50a), (2.50b), (3.12) and (3.14a), one nds:

where to obtain the nal equality we have decomposed  = a + xb, commuted xb through g,
and replaced it by a thanks to the orthogonality relation (2.6).

next we sum the expressions (3.15), (3.16) and (3.18), and compare to the right-hand side
of eq. (3.11). by inspection, we conrm the ansatze (3.7)-(3.8), where the grassmann zero
mode matrix has the form

(3.19)

36

up till this point we have yet to solve for g . this is accomplished by inserting n into the
fermionic constraints (3.9a)-(3.9b). one nds that eq. (3.9b) is satised automatically by the
expression (3.19). in contrast, eq. (3.9a) amounts to 2k2 independent real linear constraints,
which is precisely the number required to x the anti-hermitian k  k matrices g  completely
(the explicit form for g  is not required).

finally we insert this expression for n into the nal term in eq. (3.10). thanks to the
constraints (2.50a)-(2.50b) on m1, the last two terms in eq. (3.19) do not contribute to the
inner product. it is easily checked, using the self-adjointness of l, that the rst two terms in
eq. (3.19) precisely reproduce the su(4)r invariant quadrilinear (3.2), as claimed.

iv the multi-instanton collective coordinate integra-

tion measure

in this section we present an in-depth discussion of the multi-instanton collective coordinate
measure. we begin with the so-called at measure, in which the various bosonic and fermionic
collective coordinates described in sec. ii are integrated over as cartesian variables; in the at
measure, the adhm supermultiplet of constraints is implemented simply as a product of -
functions. section iv.1 reviews the eld-theory derivation of the at measure given in refs. [45,
49, 82] using uniqueness arguments, whereas sec. iv.2 presents an independent rederivation of
the at measure directly from superstring theory by exploiting the world-volume description of
d-instantons in the presence of d3-branes.

however, the at measure is not optimal for our present purposes, for the following reason.
starting in sec. v we will explore how the adhm multi-instanton formalism combines in
a natural way with the large-n limit. unfortunately, for large n, the number of collective
coordinates contained in the matrices {a,ma} grows linearly with n. in order to implement a
traditional saddle-point approach, it is desirable to change to a new set of collective coordinates
whose number stays xed as n grows. a strong clue for how to proceed comes from anticipating
sec. vi, where we nally calculate the correlators gn (n = 16, 8 or 4) and related higher-partial-
wave correlators, and put maldacenas conjecture to the test. a common feature of these n-point
functions is that the n insertions are all gauge-invariant composite operators. this suggests
that we change integration variables to a smaller set of gauge-invariant collective coordinates.
with this application in mind, sec. iv.3 is devoted to the construction of the so-called gauge-
invariant measure from the at measure. specically, this entails calculating the jacobians
needed to switch from the original multiplet of adhm variables, to the gauge-invariant bosonic
and fermionic collective coordinates which we have already identied in sec. ii.6. pleasingly, it
turns out that after one integrates out the gauge coset, the number of remaining gauge-invariant
variables no longer grows with n, but only grows with the topological number k.

37

iv.1 the adhm multi-instanton measure

we begin by reviewing the at measure on the space of adhm variables. as the small-
uctuations determinants in a self-dual background cancel between the bosonic and fermionic
sectors in a four-dimensional supersymmetric theory [83], the relevant measure is the one inher-
ited from the feynman path integral on changing variables from the elds to the collective coor-
dinates which parametrize the k-instanton moduli space mk
phys. in principle the super-jacobian
for this change of variables can be calculated by evaluating the normalization matrices of the
appropriate bosonic and fermionic zero-modes. in practice, this involves resolving the adhm
constraints and can only be accomplished explicitly for k  2.

instead, the heuristic strategy adopted in refs. [45,49,82] is to postulate a measure, and to
verify a posteriori that its form is xed uniquely by various consistency requirements enumer-
ated below. in particular, in the n = 4 supersymmetric theory, the measure has the following
form [45, 49]:

phys =

z dk
 yb=2,3,4

dk2

2k2/2(c1 )k

vol u(k) z d4k2
a1b yr=1,... ,k2h yc=1,2,3

d2k2ma dkn a dkn a

a d2kn w d2kn w ya=1,2,3,4
2trk t r(tr2  caa)(cid:1) ya=1,2,3,4 y=1,2
(cid:0) 1

 yb=2,3,4

(cid:0)trk t r(l  a1b  1b)(cid:1)i .

(cid:0)trk t r( maa  + a ma)(cid:1)

(4.1)

in writing the above, we have used a normalization for the integrations that is dierent, but
more convenient for our purposes, from that in [49]. this dierence accounts for the overall
factor of 2k2/2. the integrals over the k  k matrices an, ma and aab are dened as the
integral over the components with respect to a hermitian basis of kk matrices t r normalized so
that trk t rt s = rs. these matrices also provide explicit denitions of the -function factors in
the way indicated. encoded in this measure is information about the su(2) embeddings of the
instantons inside su(n); it is pleasing that the adhm parametrization replaces the traditional
trigonometric variables of the coset matrix  describing this embedding, by cartesian variables
endowed with a at measure (apart from the -function insertions).

we can oer the following consistency checks on this measure:

(i) in the 1-instanton sector, eq. (4.1) reduces to

phys =

z d1
 yc=1,2,3

c1

23/2 z d4a d2n w d2n w ya=1,2,3,4
2 tr2  c ww(cid:1) ya=1,2,3,4 y=1,2
(cid:0) 1

d2ma dn a dn a yb=2,3,4

da1b
(cid:0)l  a1b  1b(cid:1) .

(cid:0)aw  + w a(cid:1) yb=2,3,4

(4.2)

38

the rst -function is then resolved as per eqs. (2.33)-(2.34); also the third -function is trivial
since in the one-instanton sector l  22 as per eqs. (2.74), (2.75) and (2.33). in this way,
the bosonic part of eq. (4.2) precisely reproduces the standard one-instanton measure [73, 84];
in particular, the position xn, size , and group iso-orientation  of the instanton follows
from the identications made in sec. ii.4 above. likewise, the fermionic collective coordinates
in eq. (4.2) can be identied with the supersymmetric and superconformal modes (2.53a)-
(2.53b), and with the superpartners of the iso-orientations zero modes discussed in sec. ii.6.
to summarize, in the one-instanton sector we have

det2w = 4 ,

detl  l = 22

 a = 4 a , ma

 = 4a
 .

(4.3)

after integrating over the global iso-orientation of the instanton (as we do for the multi-
instanton measure in sec. iv.3), the one-instanton measure is

phys =

d2a d2 a d(n2)a d(n2) a.

(4.4)

22n69/22n2c1

(n  1)!(n  2)!z 4n13 d4x d ya=1,2,3,4

z d1
comparing this with the one-instanton bernard measure [84] suitably generalized to an n = 4
theory (see eq. (13) of ref. [44]14), we extract the normalization factor

c1 = 22n +1/26n g4n

(4.5)

needed below.

(ii) the k-instanton measure should be dimensionless, since the -function vanishes in this
n = 4 model. and indeed this is satised by the expression (4.1), since the engineering length
dimensions are [a] = [1b] = 1, [m] = 1/2, [dm] = 1/2, and [a1b] = 1.

(iii) if one inserts into the n = 4 measure (4.1) a mass term for (say) gauginos m3 and

m4, of the form

exp im trn(cid:0) m4(p + 1)m3 + m3(p + 1)m4(cid:1) ,

(4.6)

(see eq. (2.61)) and passes to the decoupling limit m   in the manner described in sec. 5
of ref. [49], the measure properly ows down to the n = 2 measure given in ref. [45].

(iv) the measure should preserve a net of 8kn unsaturated grassmann integrations at the
k-instanton level, in other words, 8kn exact fermion zero modes. it is easy to see that this
counting is obeyed by the right-hand side of eq. (4.1): 8k2 fermionic -functions saturate 8k2
out of the 8k2 + 8kn fermionic integrations over {ma, a, a}, leaving 8kn exact fermion
zero modes. while there is no index theorem in the n = 4 model guaranteeing this number,
due to the absence of a u(1) anomaly, the fact that this theory can be deformed into an n = 2
model, where the anomaly exists, forces this nave counting nonetheless.

14we have multiplied that result by 28 due to the dierence in conventions for integrating weyl fermions.

39

(v) the invariance of the measure (4.1) under the residual u(k) symmetry (2.22) is obvious.

(vi) cluster decomposition in the dilute-gas limit of large space-time separation between in-
stantons xes the overall constant in the k-instanton measure (4.1) in terms of the one instanton
factor c1 . the derivation is analogous to that given in [45, 82].

(vii) as with all physically relevant quantities, the k-instanton measure has to be a super-
symmetric invariant. this important requirement can be directly checked by performing the
supersymmetry transformations on the collective coordinates detailed in ref. [45]. the key
point here is that the three -functions in eq. (4.1) represent the spin-1, spin- 1
2 and spin-0
adhm constraints (2.15a), (2.50a) and (2.72), respectively, which together form an n = 4
supermultiplet of constraints. note that in the nal -function in eq. (4.1) we have singled
out the supersymmetry index 1, so that, navely, the invariance is only guaranteed for super-
symmetry transformations aqa + a qa with a = 1. however, since the a1b integration is
trivially accomplished using

z yb=2,3,4

dk2

a1b yr=1,... ,k2 yb=2,3,4

(cid:0)trk t r(l  a1b  1b)(cid:1) =(cid:0)detk2l(cid:1)3

(4.7)

which is independent of the 1 direction, the expression (4.1) is actually invariant under all
four supersymmetries; i.e. it is su(4)r invariant.

(viii) finally we can make the following uniqueness argument [49]. since the -functions in
eq. (4.1) are dictated by the adhm formalism, and since the resulting measure turns out to
be a supersymmetric invariant and also preserves the correct number of fermion zero modes,
we claim that the ansatz (4.1) is in fact unique. to see why, let us consider including an
additional function of the collective coordinates, f (a,ma), in the integrand of eq. (4.1). to
preserve supersymmetry, we require that f be a supersymmetry invariant. it is a fact that
any non-constant function that is a supersymmetry invariant must contain fermion bilinear
pieces (and possibly higher powers of fermions as well). by the rules of grassmann integration,
such bilinears would necessarily lift some of the adjoint fermion zero modes contained in the
collective coordinate matrices ma. but since eq. (4.1) contains precisely the right number of
unlifted fermion zero modes as per (iv), this argument rules out the existence of a non-constant
function f . moreover, any constant f would be absorbed into the overall multiplicative factor,
which is already xed by cluster decomposition.

in the following subsection, we shall give an alternative, more direct, derivation of the n = 4
measure (4.1), as well as the quadrilinear term (3.2), from string theory. (note that the n = 2,
n = 1 and (classical) n = 0 measures presented in [45,49,82] may in turn be derived from the
n = 4 measure, and thus ultimately from string theory, by renormalization group decoupling;
see item (iii) above and sec. 5 of [49].) but rst, we should note that the results of the a1b
integration, given by eq. (4.7), may be elegantly combined with the quadrilinear action (3.2)
derived in sec. iii, via the introduction of auxiliary gaussian k  k matrices of variables ab

in the so(6) representation the six k  k matrices a are hermitian. this kind of transfor-
mation is a well-known tool for analyzing the large-n limit of eld theories with four-fermion
interactions, like the gross-neveu and thirring models [55]. we shall nd that this transfor-
mation is absolutely crucial in our analysis, since it introduces a new set of bosonic collective
coordinates, namely a, which will have a very important role to play in the relation of the
yang-mills theory to the superstring theory.

iv.2 d-instantons and the adhm measure

in this section we will show that the n = 4 adhm measure of [49], described in sec. iv.1, can
actually be derived using d-brane techniques. we will consider n = 4 supersymmetric yang-
mills theory realized on the world-volume n d3-branes in type iib string theory. according
to [50,51], d-instantons located on the d3-branes are equivalent to yang-mills instantons in the
world-volume gauge theory. in the following we determine the collective coordinate measure
for k d-instantons, dk
in a limit where the
gauge theory on the d3-branes decouples from gravity, we nd that the d-instanton measure
coincides with our earlier results for the k-instanton adhm measure. in this section, unlike
the preceding one, we will not keep track of the overall normalization of the measure.

inst, in the presence of n d3-branes.

phys exp sk

we begin by briey reviewing some basic facts about d-branes in type ii string theory
[85]. a dp-brane is dened in the rst instance as a p-dimensional hyperplane in nine spatial
dimensions on which open strings can end. the massless states in the open string spectrum
give rise to massless elds which propagate on the p + 1 dimensional world-volume of the d-
brane. specically, the massless modes or collective coordinates of a single dp-brane come
from dimensional reduction to d = p + 1 of a u(1) vector multiplet of n = 1 supersymmetry
in contrast, closed string modes propagate in the ten dimensional bulk. after
in d = 10.
dimensional reduction, the ten-dimensional gauge eld a,  = 0, 1, 2, . . . 9, yields a p + 1
dimensional gauge eld and 9  p real scalars. the scalars specify the location of the d-brane

41

in the 9  p dimensions transverse to its world-volume. the d = 10 multiplet also includes a
majorana-weyl fermion, . the sixteen independent components of  correspond to sixteen
fermion zero modes of the d-brane. this number reects the fact that the d-brane is a bps
conguration which breaks half of the 32 supersymmetries of the type ii theory.

when k parallel dp-branes are located at dierent points in their common transverse di-
mensions their massless degrees of freedom are simply k copies of the collective coordinates
described above, which corresponds to gauge group u(1)k. however, when two or more d-
branes coincide, additional states corresponding to open strings stretched between the two
branes become massless leading to enhanced gauge symmetry [86]. in the maximal case, where
all k dp-branes coincide, the unbroken gauge group is u(k). the low-energy eective action
for the world-volume theory can be obtained from dimensional reduction of ten dimensional
super-yang-mills theory (sym10) with gauge group u(k). the ten-dimensional action is,

s(10)
k =

1
g2

10 z d10x trk(cid:0) 1

2f 2

 + i d(cid:1) ,

(4.11)

where d =   i[a, ] is the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation and
f = a  a  i[a, a] is the ten-dimensional eld strength. the -matrices obey the
ten-dimensional euclidean cliord algebra, {, } = 2. the particular representation of
the  used below is given explicitly in the appendix.

dimensional reduction to p + 1 dimensions proceeds by setting all spacetime derivatives
in the reduced directions to zero. as in the case of a single dp-brane, the ten dimensional
gauge eld yields a p + 1 dimensional gauge eld and 9  p real scalars, all in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group. congurations with some or all of the d-branes separated
in spacetime then correspond the coulomb branch of the world-volume gauge theory. in terms
of string theory parameters, the yang-mills coupling constant in d = p + 1 is identied as
p+1 = 2(2)p2e(p3)/2. this concludes the discussion of features which are common to all
g2
dp-branes. the two cases which interest us most here are the d-instanton (p = 1) and the
d3 brane (along the way we will also meet the p = 5 and p = 9 cases). first of all we recall that
in the case of n parallel d3-branes the low-energy eective theory on the brane world-volume
is n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with gauge group u(n). this conguration is the
starting point for maldacenas analysis [2]. the dimensionless four-dimensional gauge coupling
is related to the string coupling as per eq. (1.1). in general the four-dimensional elds which
propagate on the brane also have couplings to the ten-dimensional graviton and the other closed
string modes. to decouple the four-dimensional theory from gravity it is necessary to take the
limit   0.
in particular we will take this limit with the string-coupling held xed and
small. this gives a weakly coupled gauge theory on the d3-brane. note that this limit is quite
dierent from the large-n decoupling limit considered by maldacena in which the d3-branes
can reliably be described as classical solutions of type iib supergravity. as emphasized in
previous sections, maldacenas limit leads instead to the strong coupling limit (g2n  1) of
the four-dimensional gauge theory.

42

a d-instanton (or d(1)-brane) corresponds to the extreme case where the dimensional
reduction is complete and the world-volume is a single point in euclidean spacetime. cor-
respondingly, rather than nite mass or tension, a single d-instanton has nite action scl =
2(e  ic(0)) where c(0) is the ramond-ramond scalar of the iib theory. as above, the col-
lective coordinates of a charge-k d-instanton correspond to a u(k) vector multiplet of sym10.
the diagonal components of the ten-dimensional gauge eld a specify the location of k d-
instantons in r10. as we dimensionally reduce to d = 0, these degrees of freedom are c-numbers
rather than elds. in addition to a constant part equal to kscl, the action of a charge-k d-
instanton also depends on the collective coordinates via the dimensional reduction of (4.11),

sk =

trk [a, ],

(4.12)

where g0  ()2.

in addition to the manifest so(10) symmetry under ten-dimensional rotations, the action is
trivially invariant under translations of the form a  a + x1[k][k]. hence k1trk a, which
corresponds to the abelian factor of the u(k) gauge group, is identied with the center-of-mass
coordinate of the charge k d-instanton. the fermionic symmetries of the collective coordinate
action are,

a = i ,
 = [a, a] + 1[k][k]  ,

where  = i[, ]/4. the sixteen components of the majorana-weyl so(10) spinor 
correspond to the sixteen zero modes of the d-instanton conguration generated by the ac-
tion of the d = 10 supercharges. like the bosonic translation modes, these modes live in
the abelian factor of the corresponding u(k) eld, k1trk . in contrast, the majorana-weyl
spinor  parametrizes the sixteen supersymmetries left unbroken by the d-instanton. these
are analogous to the collective coordinate supersymmetries of the adhm formalism described
in [47].

in ordinary eld theory, instantons yield non-perturbative corrections to correlation func-
tions via their saddle-point contribution to the euclidean path integral. in the semiclassical
limit, the path-integral in each topological sector reduces to an ordinary integral over the in-
stanton moduli space. the extent to which similar ideas apply to d-instantons is less clear, in
part because string theory lacks a second-quantized formalism analogous to the path integral.
despite this, there is considerable evidence that d-instanton contributions to string-theory am-
plitudes also reduce to integrals over collective coordinates at weak string coupling [36]. in this
case the relevant collective coordinates are the components the ten-dimensional u(k) gauge
eld a and their superpartners . according to green and gutperle [3639], the charge-k
d-instanton contributions to the low-energy correlators of the iib theory are governed by the

43

partition function,

zk =

1

vol u(k) zu (k)

d10a d16 expsk .

(4.13)

this partition function can be thought of as the collective coordinate integration measure
for k d-instantons.
in particular, the leading semiclassical contribution of k d-instantons
to the correlators of the low-energy supergravity elds is obtained by inserting the classical
value of each eld in the integrand of (4.13). because of the symmetries described above, the
collective coordinate action sk does not depend on the u(1) components of the elds a and .
hence, to obtain a non-zero answer, the inserted elds must include at least sixteen fermions to
saturate the corresponding grassmann integrations. as in eld theory instanton calculations,
the resulting amplitudes can be interpreted in terms of an instanton-induced vertex in the low-
energy eective action. the spacetime position of the d-instanton, x, is interpreted as the
location of the vertex. in particular, the work of green and gutperle [36] has focused on a
term of the form r4 in the iib eective action (here r is the ten-dimensional curvature tensor)
and its supersymmetric completion.

so far, we have only considered d-instantons in the iib theory in a at ten dimensional
background and in the absence of other branes. in order to make contact with four-dimensional
gauge theory we need to understand how these ideas apply to d-instantons in the presence of
d3-branes. in particular we wish to determine how the d-instanton measure (4.13) is modied
by the introduction of n parallel d3-branes. conversely, in the absence of d-instantons, the
theory on the four-dimensional world volume of the d3-branes is n = 4 u(n) super yang-
mills theory. hence a related question is how the d-instantons appear from the point of view
of the four-dimensional theory on the d3 branes. in fact, the brane conguration considered
here is a special case of a system which has been studied intensively in the past. the general
case involves a conguration of k dp-branes in the presence of n d(p + 4)-branes, with all
branes parallel. as we will review below, in each of these cases the lower-dimensional brane
corresponds to a yang-mills instanton in the world-volume gauge theory of the higher [51].
we begin by reviewing the maximal case p = 5, which was rst considered (in the context of
type i string theory) by witten [52]. the cases with p < 5 then follow straightforwardly by
dimensional reduction.

we start by considering a theory of k parallel d5-branes in isolation. as above, the world-
volume theory is obtained by dimensional reduction of ten dimensional n = 1 super-yang-
mills theory with gauge group u(k). the resulting theory in six dimensions has two weyl
supercharges of opposite chirality and is conventionally denoted as n = (1, 1) sym.15 after
dimensional reduction, the so(10) lorentz group of the euclidean theory in ten dimensions is
broken to h = so(6)  so(4). the so(6) factor is the lorentz group of the six dimensional
theory while the so(4) is an r-symmetry. the ten dimensional gauge eld a splits up into

15some convenient facts about six-dimensional supersymmetry are reviewed in [87] (see page 67 in particular).

an adjoint scalar a in the vector representation of so(4) and a six dimensional gauge eld a
with a = 1, . . . , 6. explicitly we set a = (an, a) where n = 0, 1, 2, 3 is an so(4) vector index.

in order to describe the fermion content of the theory we will consider the covering group
of h, h = su(4)  su(2)l  su(2)r. we introduce indices a = 1, 2, 3, 4 and ,  = 1, 2
corresponding to each factor. as mentioned above, a ten dimensional majorana-weyl spinor can
be decomposed into two weyl spinors of opposite chirality in six dimensions. the corresponding
representation of so(10) decomposes as,

16  (4, 2, 1)  (4, 1, 2)

(4.14)

under h. an explicit decomposition of the ten-dimensional spinor  in terms of the six di-
mensional spinors, ma
 and  a is given in the appendix. as in the previous sections of this
paper, it will often be convenient to rewrite the so(6) vector a as a (quasi-real) antisymmetric
tensor ab using eq. (4.10), where ab is subject to the reality condition (4.9).

in the above, we have rescaled the elds so that the six-dimensional coupling constant, g2
only appears in front of the action of the n = (1, 1) vector multiplet. the reason for the
unconventional normalization of the fermion kinetic terms will become apparent below. for
later convenience we have also introduced a real anti-self dual auxiliary eld for the vector
multiplet, dmn = (dmn). d transforms in the adjoint representation of su(2)r, which can
be made explicit by writing dmn = dc c
mn, where the eta symbol is dened in the appendix.

(4.17)

following [51], the next step is to introduce n d9-branes of the type iib theory whose
world-volume lls the ten dimensional spacetime.16 these are analogous to the n d3-branes

16in fact a iib background with non-vanishing d9-brane charge suers from inconsistencies at the quantum
level. this is not relevant here because the d9-branes in question are just a starting point for a classical
dimensional reduction.

45

in the p = 1 case on which we will eventually focus. the world volume theory of the d9-
branes in isolation (i.e.
in the absence of the d5-branes) is simply ten dimensional u(n)
supersymmetric yang-mills. as explained by douglas [51], the eective action for this system
contains a coupling between the eld strength vmn of the world-volume gauge eld and the the
rank six antisymmetric tensor eld c which comes from the ramond-ramond sector of the
type iib theory. the latter eld is dual to the three-form eld strength which appears in the
type iib supergravity action. this coupling has the form,

z c  v  v,

(4.18)

where c and v are written as a six-form and a two-form respectively and the integration is
over the ten-dimensional world volume of the d9-branes. the same six-form eld also couples
minimally to the ramond-ramond charge carried by d5-branes. hence a conguration of the
u(n) gauge elds with non-zero second chern class, v  v , acts as a source for d5-brane
charge. more concretely, if the d9-brane gauge eld is chosen to be independent of six of the
world-volume dimensions and an ordinary yang-mills instanton is embedded in the remaining
four dimensions, then the resulting conguration has the same charge-density as a single d5-
brane. both objects are also bps saturated and therefore they also have the same tension.
further conrmation of the identication of d5-branes on a d9-brane as instantons was found
in [51] where the gauge-eld background due to a type i d5-brane was shown to be self-dual
via its coupling to the world-volume of a d1-brane probe.

as described above, d5-branes appear as bps saturated instanton congurations on the
d9-brane which break half of the supersymmetries of the world-volume theory. conversely,
the presence of d9-branes also break half the supersymmetries of the d5-brane world-volume
theory described by the action (4.15). specically, the n = (1, 1) supersymmetry of the six-
dimensional theory is broken down to the n = (0, 1) subalgebra described above equation
(4.15). to explain how this happens we recall that open strings stretched between branes give
rise to elds which propagate on the d-brane world-volume. so far we have only included the
adjoint representation elds which arise from strings stretching between pairs of d5-branes.
as our conguration now includes both d5- and d9-branes there is the additional possibility
of states corresponding to strings with one end on each of the two dierent types of brane.
as the d5-brane and d9-brane ends of the string carry u(k) and u(n) chan-paton indices
respectively, the resulting states transform in the (k, n ) representation of u(k)  u(n).

in fact the additional degrees of freedom comprise kn hypermultiplets of n = (0, 1) su-
persymmetry in six dimensions [52]. as these hypermultiplets cannot be combined to form
multiplets of n = (1, 1) supersymmetry, the residual supersymmetry of the six dimensional
theory is n = (0, 1) as claimed above. each hypermultiplet contains two complex scalars wui .
here, as previously, i and u are fundamental representation indices of u(k) and u(n) respec-
tively. the fact that hypermultiplet scalars transform as doublets of the su(2) r-symmetry is
familiar from n = 2 theories in four dimensions. each hypermultiplet also contains a pair of

46

table 1: transformation properties of the elds

the reader will have noticed that we have chosen our notation so that each six-dimensional
eld has a counterpart, denoted by the same letter, in our discussion of the adhm construction
in section iii. the only exceptions are the elds  and d whose signicance will be explained
below. also the group indices on each d = 6 eld are in one-to-one correspondence with
those on the adhm variable of the same name. the physical reason for this correspondence
is simple: the six dimensional elds are the collective coordinates of the d5-branes. as the
d5-branes are equivalent to the yang-mills instantons, the vacuum moduli space of the u(k)
gauge theory on the d5-branes should coincide with the k-instanton moduli space described
by the adhm construction. as the only scalar elds in the six-dimensional theory lie in
n = (0, 1) hypermultiplets, the relevant vacuum moduli space is conventionally referred to as
a higgs branch. precisely how the proposed equivalence arises was explained in [52] where it
was shown that the d-term vacuum conditions which follow from the six-dimensional action
coincide with the non-linear constraint equations of the adhm construction. this and several
new aspects of this correspondence will be demonstrated explicitly below.

starting from the conguration of d5 and d9-branes described above, the general case of
parallel dp- and d(p + 4)-branes with p < 5 can be obtained by dimensional reduction on the
brane world-volumes. in particular the case of d0- and d4-branes in the type iia theory has
been studied extensively because of its application as a lightcone matrix model of the (2, 0)
theory in six dimensions [88]. in this case we will perform one further dimensional reduction
and study k d-instantons in the presence of n d3-branes. following the above discussion, this
corresponds to k yang-mills instantons in the four-dimensional n = 4 theory. the symmetry
group u(k)u(n) h of the six dimensional system now has a simple interpretation in terms of
the four-dimensional theory: u(k) is the internal symmetry of the adhm construction, u(n)

48

is the gauge group, su(4) is the r-symmetry group of the n = 4 supersymmetry algebra and
so(4) = su(2)l  su(2)r is the four-dimensional lorentz group. in six dimensions the scalar
elds were all in n = (0, 1) hypermultiplets, and hence the resulting vacuum moduli space
was a higgs branch. after dimensional reduction to d = 0, the six-dimensional gauge elds a
become scalars which can acquire vevs. the resulting coulomb branch corresponds to motion
of the d-instantons in the six dimensions transverse to the d3-branes. we will see below that
a is just the auxiliary eld introduced at the end of sec. iv.1 to bilinearize the four-fermion
term in the instanton action.

we will now write down the collective-coordinate measure which determines the leading
semiclassical contribution of k d-instantons to correlation functions of the low-energy elds of
the iib theory in the presence of n d3-branes. from the above discussion, the appropriate
generalization of (4.13), is obtained by dimensionally reducing the partition function of the
six-dimensional theory with action g2
matter dened in (4.16), (4.17) and
(4.19) to zero dimensions. thus we have,

reduction of s(a)
matter. specically sk contains the six-dimensional gauge couplings of
the hypermultiplets, while sd contains the yukawa couplings and d-terms.

matter + s(f)

semiclassical correlation functions of the light elds can be calculated by replacing each
eld with its value in the d-instanton background and performing the collective coordinate
integrations with measure (4.23). in the case of the low-energy gauge elds on the d3-brane,
the relevant classical conguration is simply the charge-k yang-mills instanton specied by the
adhm data which appears explicitly in the action (4.24a)-(4.24c). note that the measure (4.23)
depends explicitly on the string length-scale through the zero-dimensional coupling g2
0  ()2
which appears in the action. as a consequence correlation functions which include elds inserted
at distinct spacetime points xi and xj will have a non-trivial expansion in powers of /|xixj|.
in order to decouple the world-volume gauge theory from gravity must take the limit   0.
0  , in the exponent of (4.23).17 our nal answer
hence we take the strong coupling limit g2
for the modied d-instanton measure is therefore,

49

as mentioned above, we have not kept track of the overall normalization of this expression
which includes a numerical constant that depends on k and n as well as some power of the
four-dimensional gauge coupling.

we can now make contact with our results for the adhm measure in sec. iv.1.18

in
particular, the equation of motion for d is precisely the non-linear adhm constraint (2.20a).
similarly the equation of motion for  is the fermionic constraint (2.50a). integration over these
variables yields the rst two sets of -functions in the measure formula (4.1). further, sk can
be compactly rewritten in the notation of sec. iv.1 as,

sk = trk ala  4itrk abab .

(4.26)

this is equal to (minus) the exponent appearing in equation (4.8). on integrating out the gauge
eld a, the instanton action reduces to the fermion quadrilinear term (3.2). we have therefore
reproduced our result for the adhm measure, up to an overall normalization constant.
in
addition the action sk + sd is invariant under eight supercharges which are inherited from
the n = (0, 1) theory in six dimensions. the resulting supersymmetry transformations are
identical to the collective coordinate supersymmetries of the n = 4 adhm measure given
in [49] (suitably generalized for gauge group u(n) as in [45]). there are also eight additional
fermionic symmetries which only appear after taking the decoupling limit   0. these
correspond to the half of the superconformal transformations of the n = 4 theory which leave
the instanton invariant.

it is interesting to compare the above discussion of d-instantons in the presence of d3-
branes with the corresponding results for the dp/d(p + 4) system with p > 0. in the p = 0 case
considered in [88], we have d0-branes which correspond to solitons in the 4 + 1 dimensional
gauge theory on the d4-brane world-volume. these solitons are just four-dimensional yang-
mills instantons thought of as static nite-energy congurations in ve dimensions. at weak
coupling, we expect the dynamics of these solitons to be correctly described by supersymmetric
quantum mechanics on the instanton moduli space. hence, it is not surprising that precisely this
quantum mechanical system is obtained in [88] by dimensionally reducing the six-dimensional
n = (0, 1) theory described above down to a single time dimension. on adding another
world-volume dimension, we obtain the d1/d5 system discussed by witten in [89]. the d1-
branes are now strings in a six dimensional yang-mills theory and, in the decoupling limit,
their world-sheet dynamics is described by a two-dimensional n = (4, 4) non-linear -model
with the adhm moduli space as the target manifold. this -model has kinetic terms for the
coordinates on the target and their superpartners and as usual the supersymmetric completion
of the action involves a four-fermion term which couples to the riemann tensor of the target.
if we reduce this action back to d = 1 by discarding spatial derivatives we obtain the quantum
mechanics of [88]. if we then reduce to d = 0 by discarding time derivatives also, the only term

18the dierence between the gauge groups u (n ) and su (n ) is irrelevant in this context because the instan-

tons always live in the nonabelian factor.

50

of the -model action which survives is the four-fermion term. this is the origin of the fermion
quadrilinear term (3.2) in the collective coordinate action.

iv.3 the gauge-invariant measure

in secs. iv.1-iv.2 we have presented eld-theory and string-theory derivations of the at mea-
sure, eq. (4.1). however, as stated earlier, this form of the measure is inadequate to our present
purposes, for two reasons:

(i) the number of bosonic and fermionic variables grows with n. such a growth is incon-
venient in light of our stated aim, in sec. v below, to treat the large-n limit in a traditional
saddle-point approximation.

(ii) the collective coordinates w and a carry a u index which transforms in the fundamental
representation of the (global) su(n) gauge group. in other words, they do not dene a gauge-
invariant set of variables. this is inecient, given that in sec. vi below, we intend to evaluate
only correlators of gauge-invariant operators.

accordingly, our present task is to change variables from w and a to the gauge-invariant
set of collective coordinates already introduced in sec. ii.6. after integrating out the degrees
of freedom corresponding to the gauge coset19

su(n)

su(n  2k)

,

(4.27)

we will nd that the number of remaining integration variables no longer grows with n, but
only with k. the main calculational aim of this subsection is to derive the bosonic and fermionic
jacobians associated with these changes of variables. the reader who is uninterested in the
details of our algebra can skip directly to our nal result for the gauge-invariant measure given
in eq. (4.55) below. note that this expression incorporates the auxiliary gaussian variables a
introduced in eqs. (4.8)-(4.10).

we begin the jacobian calculation in the bosonic sector where we need to change variables
from the collective coordinates wui , whose u index transforms in the fundamental represen-
tation of the gauge group su(n), to the gauge-invariant bilinear variables (w 
)ij dened in

eq. (2.75).

let us consider the more general mathematical problem of an n  k dimensional complex
u where u = 1, . . . , n and l = 1, . . . , k, and let us always assume n  k (which is
19actually physical gauge transformations involve modding out by an additional u (1) corresponding to overall
phase rotations since these transformations lie in the auxiliary group u (k). however, we shall loosely refer to
(4.27) as the gauge coset.

index (i, ) and so

k are complex except for the diagonal elements l

group parameters x coordinatize the coset su(n)/su(n  k) which acts non-trivially on
the  matrix; the index x runs over 1, . . . , xmax where

xmax = 2kn  k 2 .

(4.31)

obviously the number of independent real parameters, namely 2kn, is the same on both sides
of eq. (4.30).

while a priori the k

l are only dened for l  k  k, it is convenient to extend them to
k). in terms of these extended variables we dene the

(4.33)

we wish to calculate the jacobian induced by changing integration variables from the orig-
inal collective coordinates vl
u, to the gauge-invariant bilinears wkl together with the coset
parameters x. it is useful to pass through an intermediate change of variables involving the
l
k rather than the wkl. the desired jacobian can then be expressed as a quotient:

(cid:0){vl
u, vlu }(cid:1)
(cid:0){wkl, x}(cid:1)

=

(cid:0){vl
u, vlu }(cid:1)
l , x}(cid:1)(cid:30) (cid:0){wkl}(cid:1)

(4.34)

what we aim to show is that this jacobian actually factors cleanly into a function of the
gauge-invariant parameters wkl, times a function of the coset variables x; integrating over the
gauge coset then turns the latter function into some overall normalization constant that we will
evaluate explicitly.

to this end, let us analyze, in turn, the denominator and the numerator on the right-hand
side of eq. (4.34). the denominator is readily evaluated from eq. (4.32) by induction in k. for
k = 1 one has simply w11/1

for k to that for k  1; one nds

(4.35)

(4.36)

next, we evaluate the numerator on the right-hand side of eq. (4.34). at this stage, it is
useful to make an explicit choice of coset coordinates x. we choose them to be simply the
independent entries of the rst k orthonormal columns ul of :

ul
u = ul ,

ul  ul

= ll

.

(4.37)

the n-vectors ul then provide the well-known parametrization of the coset as a product of
spheres [90]. to see this, u1 is a unit vector in an n-dimensional complex space and consequently
parametrizes s2n1. the second vector u2 is a similar unit vector, but one which is orthogonal
to u1, and consequently parameterizes s2n3. continuing this chain of argument, we see that
the vectors {ul} parametrize the product of spheres

su(n)

su(n  k)  s2n1  s2n3      s2n2k+1 .

(4.38)

53

from (4.30) we can read o the expansion of the vectors vl in terms of this basis:

l

vl =

(4.39)

xk=1

the numerator on the right-hand side of eq. (4.34) can be determined through the following
iterative process. first we start with v1 = 1
1u1, whose measure can be written in polar
coordinates as

dv1

udv1u = 2n (1

1)2n1 d1

1 d2n1 1 .

(4.40)

here d2n1 1 is the usual measure for the solid angles on s2n1 parametrized by u1. continuing
the process on the next vector v2 = 2

where l is parametrized by ul. hence

(4.41)

(4.42)

(4.43)

using eqs. (4.33), (4.34), (4.36) and (4.43), we therefore obtain

dv = 2n kk(k+1)/2(detkw )nk dk 2

w d2n1 1 d2n3 2    d2n2k+1 k .

(4.44)

thus, when this measure is used to integrate only gauge-invariant quantities, as we shall do
in sec. vi, then only the det w piece survives; the remaining terms are integrated over the
gauge coset to give an overall normalization constant reecting the volume of the coset (4.27).
re-introducing k = k/2 and the vectors w, we state our nal result as

d2kn w d2kn w = ck,n (det2kw )n2k dk2

(4.45)

the integral over the 2k  2k matrix w has been written as four separate integrals over the
kk matrices w 0 and w c, dened in (2.54), with respect to the basis t r, dened below (4.1).20
the normalization constant is precisely

in changing variables from the ws to the w s, one must also, of course, specify the in-
tegration domain for the latter. since these variables are the inner products of vectors they
will be constrained by various triangle inequalities. fortunately, these technicalities will not be
important for us, the reason being that the saddle-point values of the w s obtained in sec. 5.2
satisfy all such triangle inequalities by inspection.

we now turn to the fermionic sector. as explained in sec. ii.6, the fermionic equivalent of
integrating out the gauge coset is to integrate out the grassmann variables a and a dened in
eqs. (2.59)-(2.60). since these coordinates are orthogonal to the w and w vectors, respectively,
it is easy to see from (2.50a) that they do not appear in the fermionic adhm constraints;
however, they do appear in the fermion quadrilinear term (3.2). the jacobian for the change of
variables from the original fermionic coordinates {a, a} to the variables of sec. ii.6, namely
{ a,  a, a, a}, is, for each value of a,21

(cid:0){a, a}(cid:1)
(cid:0){ a,  a, a, a}(cid:1)

= (det2k w )k .

(4.47)

in order to integrate out the a and a variables it is useful to split the fermion bilinear

(2.73) that couples to ab in (4.8) as

where the rst term has components just depending on {a, a}:

ab = ab + ab,

uj  b
and the second term depends on the remaining variables

we can now explicitly integrate out the as and as:

z ya=1,2,3,4
where the determinant is of (ab)ij viewed as a 4k  4k matrix.

actually, going to a gauge invariant measure carries with it a very signicant advantage:
we can integrate out the adhm -functions explicitly. in the bosonic sector, one notices that
the adhm constraints are written as

(4.52)
21we dene the integrals over the k  k matrices  a and  a with respect to the hermitian basis t r, as for

in terms of the gauge invariant coordinates. notice that they are linear in w c and conse-
quently the w c integrals simply remove the bosonic adhm -functions in (4.1) (giving rise
to the numerical factor of 23k2 from the 1
2s in the arguments of the -functions). there is a
similar happy story in the fermionic sector: in terms of the new variables the fermionic adhm
constraints (2.50a) are



 a

 + w   a +(cid:2)ma, a (cid:3) = 0.

(4.53)

(4.54)

these equations can be used to eliminate the 8k2 variables  a

 + w   a +(cid:2)ma, a (cid:3))(cid:17) = (det2k w )k .

notice that the factor on the right-hand side conveniently cancels the jacobian of (4.47).

putting everything together we now have a much simpler form for the measure for integrating

gauge invariant quantities:

(4.55)

in particular, since the number of integration variables no longer grows with n (in contradis-
tinction to the at measure), this expression is immediately amenable to a large-n saddle-point
analysis, to which we now turn.

v the large-n limit in a saddle-point approximation

v.1 the one-instanton measure revisited, and the emergence of the

s5

as a prelude to the technically demanding case of multi-instantons, it is instructive to revisit
the one-instanton sector, and in particular, to derive the result (1.26) cited in sec. i.3 above [44].
in this simple setting, we will formulate a large-n saddle-point method which naturally extends
to k > 1, and we will already see the emergence of the s5 factor expected from the ads/cft
correspondence.

consider the gauge invariant measure (4.55) for k = 1. in this case we can greatly simplify

the expression: in addition to the relations (4.3) one has ab = 0, and also [44]

the rst equality in eq. (5.1) is a well-known factorization property of 4 4 antisymmetric ma-
trices, while the second equality involves the so(6) rewrite (4.10). introducing six-dimensional
polar coordinates a = {r, }, one then nds for the measure:

(5.3)

from eqs. (5.2)-(5.3) one sees that the xn and  integrations assemble into the scale-invariant
ads5 volume form d4x d 5. moreover we can perform the integration over , yielding
vol s5 = 3, to recapture the numerical factor cn quoted in eq. (1.26) (where the remaining
powers of two come from the factors of 96 associated to each of the operator insertions).

equations (5.2)-(5.3) are the principal result of [44], and, we stress, are exact for all n.
however, this exactness can be traced to the factorization property (5.1), which is special to
the one-instanton sector. in order to generalize the above to k > 1, at least in the large-n limit,
it is important to reproduce these results in an alternative way, using saddle-point methods.
to this end, note that the integral in is nothing but a gamma function. for large n it is well
approximated by stirlings formula, which, the reader will recall, is derived as follows. first

one rescales r  n r, or equivalently

n a ,

a 

(5.4)

(5.5)

so that n factors out of the exponent. the integral then becomes

in = n 2n1z 

0

dr r3 e2n (log r22r2) ,

which is in a form amenable to a standard saddle-point evaluation. the saddle-point is at
r = 1 and, to leading order, a gaussian integral around the solution gives

lim
n

in = 24n n 2n1e2nr 

n

,

(5.6)

which is valid up to 1/n corrections.

while this is all very elementary, we have uncovered something truly surprising. a single
yang-mills instanton in an n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory is eectively parametrized at
large n by its position xn, scale size , and a point  on s5 (as well as the sixteen fermionic col-
lective coordinates). notice that this parametrization only emerges in the large-n limit where
the solution of the saddle-point equations identies the radius of the sphere with the inverse of
the instanton scale size; i.e. the radius of the sphere with the radial variable of ads5. these

57

parameters are precisely the coordinates required to specify the position of an object in the
ten-dimensional space ads5  s5, where 1 is a radial coordinate on the ads5. given malda-
cenas conjectured correspondence between correlation functions in the supergravity theory in
ten dimensions and the four-dimensional gauge theory on its boundary, this leads us to identify
a large-n yang-mills instanton with a (singly-charged) d-instanton. in this identication, the
sixteen supersymmetric and superconformal zero-modes of the yang-mills instanton {a
 ,  a}
are identied with the sixteen supersymmetries of the type iib string theory broken by the
d-instanton denoted  in eq. (1.7).

v.2 navely the k-instanton moduli space contains k copies of ads5

s5

we now turn to the case of general topological number k. for k > 1 one quickly abandons any
hope of performing the integrations in eq. (4.55) exactly. instead, let us extend the large-n
saddle-point treatment developed in sec. v.1. as in the one-instanton sector, we rst perform
the rescaling (5.4). the gauge-invariant measure (4.55) then becomes:

(5.7)

here, in anticipation of the large-n limit, we have already applied stirlings formula to the
numerical prefactor (4.46). we have also introduced the eective k-instanton action se in
which all the terms which scale with n are collected:22

se = 2k(1 + 3 log 2)  log det2kw  log det4k + trk ala .

(5.8)

this expression involves the 11k2 bosonic variables comprising the eleven independent k  k
hermitian matrices w 0, an and a. the remaining components w c, c = 1, 2, 3, are eliminated
in favor of the an via the adhm constraint (4.52). the action is invariant under the u(k)
symmetry (2.23) which acts by adjoint action on all the variables.

with n factored out of the exponent, the measure is in a form which is amenable to a

saddle-point treatment as n  . the coupled saddle-point equations read:

abcd (l  ab) ce = 1
aa = 1

2 d
e 1[k][k] ,
2 (w 1)0 ,

[a, [a, an]] = ic

nm[am, (w 1)c] .

(5.9a)

(5.9b)

(5.9c)

22as previously, we translate back and forth as convenient between the antisymmetric tensor representation

ab and the so(6)r vector representation a, a = 1, . . . , 6 (4.10).

58

these are obtained by varying se with respect to the matrix elements of , w 0 and an,
respectively, and rewriting log det as tr log. we have employed the k  k matrices

(w 1)0 = tr2 w 1,

(w 1)c = tr2  cw 1.

(5.10)

the general solution to these coupled saddle-point equations is easily found.

it has the

simple property that all the quantities are diagonal in instanton indices,

a = diag(cid:0)1

(5.12)

a simple picture of this leading-order saddle-point solution emerges: it can be thought of as
k independent copies of the one-instanton saddle-point solution described in sec. v.1, where the
ith instanton is parametrized by a point (x i
a) on ads5  s5. additional insight into this
solution emerges from considering the su(2) generators (tc
i )uv describing the embedding of the
ith instanton inside su(n). from eqs. (2.44c), (2.54) and (5.11a) one derives the commutation
relations

n, i, i

[ ta

i , tb

j ] = 2iij abc tc
i

(5.13)

so that at the saddle-point, thanks to the kronecker-, the k individual instantons lie in k
mutually commuting su(2) subgroups. actually this feature follows from large-n statistics
alone,23 and has nothing to do with either the existence of supersymmetry or with the details
of the adhm construction; nevertheless the fact that eq. (5.13) emerges from the saddle-
point equations is a reassuring check on our formalism.
in this one particular respect, the
solution (5.11a)-(5.11c) can be said to be dilute-gas-like. another important property is that
the eective action (5.8) evaluated on these saddle-point solutions is zero; hence there is no
exponential dependence on n in the nal result. finally we should make the technical point
that, thanks to the diagonal structure of these solutions, they are automatically consistent
with the triangle inequalities on the boson bilinear w discussed in the paragraph following
eq. (4.46); hence we never need to specify more explicitly the integration limits on the w
variables.

23consider the analogous problem of k randomly oriented vectors in rn in the limit n  ; clearly the dot

products of these vectors tend to zero simply due to statistics.

59

we are now squarely faced with the puzzle described in sec. i: the fact that we have obtained
k copies of ads5  s5 ostensibly contradicts the supergravity side of the ads/cft correspon-
dence, where only one copy of this moduli space appears at each topological level k (e.g., see
the supergravity expression (1.15) for the correlator g16). in the following subsection we show
that this k-fold degeneracy is lifted when one considers small uctuations in the neighborhood
of the generic solution (5.11a)-(5.11c), and that the yang-mills multi-instanton moduli space
indeed collapses to a single copy, precisely as dictated by maldacenas conjecture.

v.3 the exact k-instanton moduli space collapses to one copy of

ads5  s5

let us repeat some general lore about saddle-point methods. to evaluate a multi-dimensional
integral in saddle-point approximation, it never suces merely to identify the space of saddle-
point solution(s). one must also evaluate the leading non-vanishing small-uctuations integral
in the background of the solution(s). typically this small-uctuations integral is gaussian, and
produces a prefactor proportional to (det m)1/2 where m is the quadratic form. if m has null-
vector directions, one needs to go beyond quadratic order in small uctuations, specically up
to the order where the degeneracy in these directions is lifted. of course, the degeneracy may
persist to all orders reecting the existence of a moduli-space of saddle-point solutions. one
must then introduce collective coordinates which parametrize the at directions of the leading-
order action24 and restrict the small-uctuations integration to directions orthogonal to the
moduli. however, the at directions of the leading-order action can still be lifted at higher order
in 1/n. for example, this happens when the small uctuations determinant described above
depends explicitly on the moduli. on exponentiating the determinant we nd a potential term
of order n 0 which corrects the leading-order action and lifts the at directions. this eect is
particularly important when the space of saddle-point solutions is non-compact as the potential
term can render the otherwise divergent integral over the collective coordinates nite. finally,
there may be at directions which remain unlifted to all orders in 1/n (typically because they
are protected by a symmetry). in this case the corresponding collective coordinates parametrize
a moduli-space of exactly degenerate stationary-points of the eective action to all orders in
1/n.

now let us apply these general considerations to the particular space of saddle-point so-
lutions obtained in sec. v.2 above. at the k-instanton level, to leading order in 1/n, this
solution space has the geometry of (ads5  s5)k. however, a small-uctuations analysis in the
background of a generic solution point conrms that most of this degeneracy is actually lifted
at the next order by the eect described above. specically, the at directions corresponding
to the relative positions of the k instantons on ads5  s5 are lifted at order n 0. thus we nd
24in the following, leading-order action denotes those terms in the exponent of the integrand which are of

order n .

60

that the exact, unlifted, bosonic moduli space consists of only one copy of ads5  s5 which
corresponds to the center-of-mass position of the instantons. furthermore, we will see that the
large-n saddle-point expansion can be reformulated as an expansion in uctuations around
the exact saddle-points parametrized by these moduli. in particular, the leading order in this
expansion can be elegantly reinterpreted as a partition function of a standard supersymmetric
su(k) gauge theory, and in this way, reduced to previously known results. we will see that
this matches precisely the description of d-instantons in string theory.

in order to verify these claims, let us rst perform a small-uctuations expansion in the
neighborhood of a generic solution point on (ads5  s5)k. by generic we mean that for all i
and j,

n 6= x j
x i
n ,

a 6= j
i
a ,

i 6= j .

(5.14)

we will truncate the expansion at gaussian order, and restrict ourselves for now to the bosonic
degrees of freedom. let us introduce k  k uctuating elds { w 0
ij , aij , anij }, in the
background of the solution (5.11a)-(5.11c), by dening:

w 0 = diag(cid:0)22
a = diag(cid:0)1
an = diag(cid:0)  x 1

k(cid:1) + w 0 ,
a(cid:1) + a ,
n(cid:1) + an .

inserting these expressions into se, one nds that the gaussian integration is governed by the
eective quadratic action

s(2) = x1i,jk(cid:16)vij  vij(cid:12)(cid:12)ij  ij(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:12)vij  ij(cid:12)(cid:12)

by inspection, the quadratic form (5.16) is positive semi-denite. the null-vectors can be

vectors are the k(k  1) independent variations ij in the directions

with no sum on i and j. these are precisely the variations induced by the adjoint action of
u(k)/u(1)k
diag on the solution. in summary, at a generic point (5.14), all the gaussian null-
vectors correspond to directions which are already explicitly taken into account by the moduli
for (ads5  s5)k  u(k)/u(1)k
diag. conversely, since there are no additional null-vectors, we
conclude that at a generic solution point this moduli space is complete (at least locally).

n = x j

a = j

n, i = j, and i

however the generic case (5.14) is not the full story. in particular, whenever a vector vij
associated to a pair of instantons is zero, additional at directions appear at quadratic order.
the condition vij = 0 requires that the two instantons live at the same point in ads5  s5,
i.e., x i
a. at this special point, all the variations ij which are
orthogonal to the vector uij are at to quadratic order. correspondingly, the determinantal
prefactor (detm)1/2 blows up. additional zeroes of this determinant appear whenever the
positions of additional instantons coalesce, leading to a greater divergence. as above, if one
were to exponentiate this determinantal prefactor, one would naturally obtain a correction to
the leading-order action of order n 0. in the present case this leads to an attractive singular
potential which partially lifts the degeneracy in the moduli space, and draws the k distinct
instantons to a common center in ads5  s5 ! loosely speaking, the attractive interaction
results in a k-instanton bound state. however, the divergent nature of potential indicates
that the above analysis in terms of quadratic uctuations around the generic saddle-point is
not adequate. in particular, the extra zero modes appearing when two instantons approach
each other mean that, in these regions of the moduli space, we must go to higher order in the
uctuation expansion.

to perform a consistent saddle-point analysis, we should now expand to next-to-leading
order around the generic solution and augment the quadratic action s(2) with a term s(4)
quartic in w 0, a and an. after integrating out these uctuations, we should nally obtain
a convergent integral over those moduli of the generic saddle-point solution which describe
the relative positions of the k instantons on ads5  s5. in fact we will meet an important
simplication which means that we will not need to perform these steps in full. we will nd
that the leading order in 1/n can actually be obtained by a much simpler proceedure: rather
than expanding in uctuations around the generic solution we will instead expand around the
maximally degenerate solution identied above. this amounts to treating the k  1 relative
positions on ads5  s5 as uctuations around the maximally-degenerate solution rather than
moduli of the generic solution. one way of seeing that the two proceedures are equivalent
at leading order in 1/n is to note that s(2), which by denition is quadratic in uctuations
around the generic solution, also happens to depend only quadratically on the moduli. this
means that the exact expression (5.16) for s(2) can also be viewed as a term of quartic order in

62

an expansion around the maximally-degenerate solution where the additional moduli are now
thought of as uctuations. thus the leading-order term in our new expansion of the action
automatically contains the leading-order term in the old one. however, the leading term in
the new expansion also contains additional quartic terms which lift the extra zero modes of
the degenerate congurations thereby remove the divergent behaviour discovered above. in the
following we shall nd, up to an overall integral over one copy of ads5s5, a nite well-dened
answer for the leading term in the large-n expansion of the adhm measure.

as discussed above we will now begin our small uctuations analysis afresh, this time in

the background of the maximally degenerate saddle-point solution

w 0 = 22 1[k][k],

a = 1 a 1[k][k],

an = xn 1[k][k] ,

(5.21)

which corresponds to k instantons living at a common point {xn, a, } in ads5  s5. (from
the adhm constraint (4.52) it follows that the remaining components of w vanish: w c = 0 for
c = 1, 2, 3.) this degenerate solution, unlike eqs. (5.11a)-(5.11c), is invariant under the residual
u(k). with the instantons sitting on top of one another, it looks like the complete opposite of
the dilute instanton gas limit; however the instantons still live in k mutually commuting su(2)
subgroups of su(n) as per eq. (5.13), which is a dilute-gas-like feature. notice that, just as
in the one instanton sector, the radius of the s5 is xed to be 1 at the saddle-point.

in order to expand about this special solution, one rst needs to factor out the exact moduli
corresponding to the common position of the k-instanton bound state on ads5  s5. this is
done in the following way. for each k  k matrix, we introduce a basis of traceless hermitian
matrices t r, r = 1, . . . , k2  1, normalized by trk t r t s = rs. for each k  k matrix v we
separate out the scalar component v0 by taking

v = v01[k][k] + vr t r .

the change of variables from the t r basis used in (4.1) {1[k][k], t r} involves a jacobian

dk2

v = k1/2dv0 dk21v,

(5.22)

(5.23)

where 1 refers to bosons and fermions, respectively. for the moment we continue to focus on
the bosonic variables, which are decomposed as follows:

an = xn1[k][k] + an ,
a = 1 a1[k][k] + a .

(5.24a)

(5.24b)

by denition the traceless matrix variables an and a are the uctuating elds (there is no need
to write an or  a). note that, in terms of the generic solution considered above, the diagonal
entries of the matrices an and a correspond to the moduli u and v while the o-diagonal
elements correspond to uctuations.

63

inserting eqs. (5.24a)-(5.24b) into eq. (5.8) and taylor expanding is a tedious though
straightforward exercise. as anticipated above, we will now expand to fourth order in the
uctuating elds around the solution parametrized by the ten exact ads5  s5 moduli. the
expansion of the determinant terms in (5.8) is facilitated by rst writing log det as tr log
and then expanding the logarithm:

tr2k log w = 2k log 2 +

1
2 trk(w 0) 

1
44 trk(w 0)2 +

1
328 trk(w 0)4 +



and

293

3

tr4k(cid:0)  (cid:1)3  2104tr4k(cid:0)  (cid:1)4 +    .

(5.26)

in these expansions we have dropped fth- and higher-order terms in the uctuating elds. here
we are anticipating the fact that these terms are not needed to regularize the small-uctuations
integration. on obtaining a nite answer from the leading-order terms we may immediately
rescale the integration variables in a standard way which shows that the uctuations around the
maximally degenerate saddle point are of order n1/4. the higher order terms in the exponent
therefore yield subleading contributions in the large-n expansion. in particular, this is true for
the diagonal components of an and a which correspond to the moduli of the generic saddle-
point solution discussed earlier in this section. this shows that our large-n expansion around
the maximally degenerate saddle-point is self-consistent. in eq. (5.25) we have used eq. (4.52),
while in eq. (5.26) and in subsequent equations we move back and forth as convenient between
the 6-vector and the antisymmetric tensor representations of  and  using eq. (4.10).
in
particular, the so(6) orthonormality condition    = 1 becomes, in 4  4 matrix language,
(5.27)

or

  =  1

81[4][4] ,

1 = 8  ,

which has been implemented in eq. (5.26).

next we need a systematic method for re-expressing the traces over 4k  4k matrices in

eq. (5.26) as traces over k  k matrices. we will exploit the following moves:26

  =     1

tr4 ef = tr4 f e =  1

4(   )1[4][4] ,
2(e  f ) ,

(5.28a)

(5.28b)

(5.28c)

tr4 ef gh = 1

16(cid:0)eafagbhb  eafbgahb + eafbgbha(cid:1) .

on the left-hand sides of eq. (5.28b)-(5.28c), the 4k  4k matrices {e, f, g, h} are assumed
to be antisymmetric in su(4)r indices and subject to the usual conditions (4.9)-(4.10); the
26in the following, we should emphasize that  only acts on instanton indices, as per the reality condition

(4.9), and not on su (4) matrix indices.

64

identity (5.28a) follows from a double application of eq. (4.9). using eqs. (5.27)-(5.28c) in an
iterative fashion, it is then easy to derive the following trace identities:

(5.29c)

as before, on the left-hand side of these formulae, 4k  4k matrix multiplication is implied,
whereas on the right-hand side, all so(6) indices are saturated in standard 6-vector inner
products, leaving the traces over k  k matrices.

from eqs. (5.8), (5.25), (5.26), and (5.29a)-(5.29c), one obtains for the bosonic eective

action:

sb = s(2) + s(3) + s(4)

(5.30)

where the quadratic, cubic and quartic actions are now given entirely as k-dimensional (rather
than 2k or 4k-dimensional) traces:

notice that only k2 uctuations, denoted , are actually lifted at quadratic order. this, in turn,
implies that certain terms in s(3) and s(4) are subleading, and can be omitted. specically, the
omitted terms in the nal rewrites in eqs. (5.31b)-(5.31c) contain, respectively, two or more,
and one or more, factors of the quadratically lifted  modes, and consequently are suppressed
in large n (as a simple rescaling argument again conrms).

65

now let us perform the elementary gaussian integration over the s. changing integration

variables in eq. (5.7) from dk2w 0 to dk2 using eq. (5.31a), one nds:

z dk2

w 0 en (s(2)+s(3)) = (cid:16) 44

n (cid:17)k2/2

en s(4)

(5.32)

where the new induced quartic coupling reads

s(4) = 4trk(cid:0)     4(   )2(cid:1)2

.

(5.33)

combining s(4) with the original quartic coupling (5.31c) gives for the eective bosonic small-
uctuations action:

sb = 

1
2

trk(cid:0)4[an, am]2 + 2[ a, an]2 + 4[ a, b]2(cid:1) .

remarkably, all dependence on the unit vector a has canceled out.

(5.34)

notice that apart from the absence of derivative terms, the expression (5.34) looks like a
yang-mills eld strength for the gauge group su(k)! we can make this explicit by introducing
a ten-dimensional vector eld a,

in terms of which

a = n 1/4(cid:0)1an,  a(cid:1) ,  = 0, . . . , 9 ,

nsb(a) = 

1
2

trk [a, a]2 .

(5.35)

(5.36)

we recognize this as precisely the action of ten-dimensional su (k) gauge theory, reduced to
0 + 0 dimensions, i.e., with all derivatives set to zero.

now let us turn to the fermions. since n = 4 supersymmetry in four dimensions descends
from n = 1 supersymmetry in ten dimensions, and since all our saddle-point manipulations
commute with supersymmetry, we expect to nd the n = 1 supersymmetric completion of the
ten-dimensional dimensionally-reduced action (5.36), namely

nsf(a, ) = trk  [a, ] ,

(5.37)

where  is a ten-dimensional majorana-weyl spinor, and  is an element of the ten-dimensional
cliord algebra. to see how this comes about, we rst separate out from the fermionic collective
coordinates the exact zero modes, in analogy to eqs. (5.24a)-(5.24b):

 = 4a

ma
 a = 4 a1[k][k] +  a .

 1[k][k] + 4a   a + ma
 ,

(5.38a)

(5.38b)

here a
 and  a are the supersymmetric and superconformal fermion modes (2.53a)-(2.53b).
expanding the fermion coupling in the exponent of (5.7) around the special solution (5.21) and

66

using the relations (4.52) and (5.31a), we nd

nsf = i(cid:16) 82n

n 1/8(cid:0)1/2 ma

and the  matrices according to eq. (a.12) below, we do in fact recover the simple form (5.37).
in moving from eq. (5.39) to eq. (5.37) we have dropped the term depending on ; since 
is a quadratically lifted bosonic mode its contribution is suppressed in large n compared to
the other couplings in eq. (5.39), as a simple rescaling argument conrms. note that unlike
the bosonic sector, the a dependence of the fermionic action does not actually disappear; as
discussed in the appendix, it is simply subsumed into the representation of the ten-dimensional
cliord algebra.

(5.39)

(5.40)

finally our eective measure for the k instantons has the form

ng8e2ik

inst =

phys esk

z dk
where zk is the partition function of an n = 1 supersymmetric su(k) gauge theory in ten
dimensions dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions:

(5.42)

notice that the rest of the measure, up to numerical factors, is independent of the instan-
ton number k. when integrating expressions which are independent of the su (k) degrees-of-
freedom, zk is simply an overall constant factor. a calculation of ref. [57] revealed that zk is
proportional topd|k d2, a sum over the positive integer divisors d of k. however, the constant
of proportionality was xed denitively in ref. [56] to give27

zk = 217k2/2k/289k2/29/2k1/2xd|k

(5.43)

in evaluating zk, we have used

as expected from the ads/cft correspondence (albeit counter-intuitive from the point of view
of the eld theory), only one copy of the ads5  s5 moduli space appears at any k.

v.4 comments on the ten-dimensional su (k) partition function

it is worthwhile making some remarks about the su(k) partition function zk dened in
eq. (5.42). to begin with, it may surprise the reader that this integral even exists! the
following nave argument suggests that it diverges [56]: consider the basis where a1 (say)
is diagonal; then uctuations in the directions where the other a are also diagonal are un-
suppressed. however, this argument does not take into account that for suciently large k
and/or d (d being the dimension of space-time), these uctuations are of measure zero. the
question of convergence has only recently been denitively settled in refs. [56]. for the purely
bosonic version of the integral, it converges in the cases {d = 3, k  4}, {d = 4, k  3} and
{d  5, k  2}, and diverges otherwise. in the supersymmetric version the convergence is even
better; in fact no divergent cases are believed to exist.

second, we invite the reader to compare our gauge invariant measure (5.41) with the measure
for d-instanton in at space, the u(k) partition function (4.13). clearly the u(1) part of this
partition function, describing the center-of-mass coordinates of the d-instanton conguration
has been generalized to the (supersymmetrized) volume measure on ads5  s5, as in (1.7);
however, the su(k) part of the partition function is identical in both cases. hence, we nd
a very attractive matching of large-n yang-mills instantons with string theory d-instantons.
in particular, on the d-instanton side, the intuition of [3639], suggests that, as far as the
contribution to the correlation functions gn, the d-instantons contribution can be thought
of as being due to a charge k d-instanton bound state, is matched by our large-n instanton
analysis and our identication of the moduli space as one copy of ads5  s5.

third, it is interesting that the large-n description of k yang-mills instantons, in an n = 4
supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory, is described by a su(k) gauge theory. this kind of
duality between gauge group and adhm auxiliary group has been noted previously in a
string theory context [5052], as is apparent from our discussion in sec. iv.2. for the other
classical groups, it is a well-known feature of the adhm construction that the duality exchanges
groups, i.e. o(n)  sp(k) and sp(n)  o(k) [76], although it turns out that in each of these
cases large-n instantons are described by a unitary gauge theory.

68

finally, we should comment on the fact that zk is proportional to the non-integer expression
pd|k d2, rather than an integer as would normally be expected from the gauss-bonnet-chern

(gbc) theorem. the normal expectation goes as follows. we start by recalling that the
coecient of the four-fermion term in the instanton action can be identied with the riemann
tensor of the instanton moduli space; this is familiar from supersymmetric quantum mechanics
[91] and the analysis of the three-dimensional theory with sixteen supercharges given in [30].
to formally evaluate the k-instanton contribution to a correlator such as g16, one must bring
down powers of the quadrilinear term to saturate the extra grassmann integrations which are
left over after the explicit fermion insertions are accounted for. the resulting bosonic integrand
involves a power of the riemann tensor with various indices contracted and is just the gaussian
curvature of the moduli space. the relevant moduli space here is actually a relative moduli
space where eight center-of-mass degrees of freedom, which are the superpartners of the sixteen
exact zero modes, have been modded out. this space, which we will denote mk,n is obtained
by taking a quotient of the full moduli space of k adhm instantons for gauge group u(n), by
translations, dilatations and global su(2) gauge rotations.

if the instanton moduli space were both compact and smooth the integral of the gaussian
curvature would simply be equal to its euler character by the gbc theorem.
in this well-
behaved case the euler character is also equal to the index of the laplacian, or in physical
terms, the witten index of supersymmetric quantum mechanics dened on the manifold in
question. in reality the adhm moduli space is non-compact and has singular points where
instantons coincide or shrink to zero size. the three-dimensional case considered in [30] was
somewhat better behaved as the moduli space of three-dimensional instantons (which are bps
monopoles), while still non-compact, is smooth. in these cases, one can still formally dene a
witten index which now counts the number of normalizable zero energy states (weighted by
fermion number). however, this index is in general no longer equal to the gbc integral which
arises in the instanton calculation. instead, the gbc integral is what is known as the principal
or bulk contribution to the index which diers from the index itself by a surface term.

taking various normalizations into account, the result of sec. v.3 can be interpreted as
saying that the principal contribution to the generalized index of supersymmetric quantum

tribution to the corresponding index in m(atrix) quantum mechanics, which is actually just
the n = 0 case of the conguration considered in this section, is also known to be equal to

mechanics on mk,n is equal to pd|k d2 in the large-n limit. interestingly, the principal con-
pd|k d2 [57]. in both these cases the surface terms must certainly be non-zero as the principal

contribution is fractional. this is to be contrasted with the three-dimensional example discussed
in [30], where it was argued that the corresponding surface terms vanish (this vanishing was
demonstrated explicitly in the two-instanton case). finally, we note that the occurrence of inte-
grals which formally give the euler character of instanton moduli space suggests an interesting
connection with the partition function of the twisted n = 4 theory evaluated in [32].

vi large-n instanton correlation functions

finally, we can use our gauge-invariant large-n measure to calculate correlation functions
ho1(x1)  on(xn)i of gauge-invariant composite operators. before we consider specic n-point
functions, let us make the following general comments. at leading order in n, we can replace
each operator insertion with its classical k-instanton saddle-point value. since the saddle-point
solution of sec. v.3 is relatively simple, this observation greatly streamlines the form of the
operator insertions. we will restrict our attention to operators o(x) consisting of a single trace
on the gauge group index of a product of adjoint scalars, fermions and eld strengths. each of
these three adjoint quantities is of the type u xu where x is some matrix of adhm variables;
consequently o has the generic form

o(x) = trn(cid:2) u x 1u u x 2u    u x pu(cid:3) = trn +2k(cid:2)px 1px 2p   px p(cid:3) ,

where p = u u is the projection operator (2.10). it is easily checked that at the saddle-point,
the bosonic adhm quantities f , an, l and p collapse to

(6.1)

f 

1

y2 + 2 1[k][k] ,

p  1[n+2k][n+2k] 

an   xn1[k][k] , l  22 ,

1

y  w  y21[2k][2k](cid:19) ,

w y 

(6.2a)

(6.2b)

where y = x x as before. deviations from these saddle-point values are suppressed by powers
of n1/4 as follows from the rescaling (5.35).

the analogous replacement prescription for the fermionic adhm quantities is, in general,
somewhat trickier. while these, too, are amenable to a saddle-point analysis as described in
sec. vi.2 below, they are also subject to the stringent selection rules of grassmann integration.
in sec. vi.1 we will focus on the relatively straightforward correlators g16, g8 and g4 for
which a large-n evaluation of the fermionic quantities is actually moot; this is because all the
grassmann variables in the insertions must be replaced by the sixteen exact supersymmetric
and superconformal zero modes in order to obtain a nonzero result. in contrast, in sec. vi.2 we
will discuss a tower of higher partial-wave operators in which, in addition to these sixteen exact
modes, there are left-over grassmann collective coordinates which must be carefully analyzed
in large n.

vi.1 multi-instanton contributions to the correlators gn

as follows from eqs. (2.11) and (2.46). here, as always, the grassmann parameters a
measure the strength of the sixteen exact supersymmetric and superconformal zero modes; for
a nonzero result, each of the sixteen a
 insertions must saturate a distinct such mode. the
omitted terms in eq. (6.5) stand for the remaining, lifted, fermion modes which can therefore
be dropped. putting eqs. (6.5), (6.4) and (6.2b) together, gives us the leading order behavior

where the other fermion modes are neglected. recalling the denition (1.8) of the supergravity
propagator k, we see that this is precisely the one-instanton expression (1.23) apart from the
overall factor of k, which comes trivially from tracing over a k  k unit matrix:

thus the sixteen insertions account for a factor k16 relative to the one-instanton calculation
reviewed in sec. i.3.

(6.8)

to leading semi-classical order, this is in perfect agreement with the corresponding supergravity
expression dened by eqs. (1.14)-(1.15). in particular, note that the factor of k16 from eq. (6.7),
taken together with the factors of k in eq. (5.45), precisely reproduces the leading semiclassical
approximation (1.14) to the modular form f16(,  ). moreover, thanks to the proportionality
(6.7), we have nally answered the puzzle posed in sec. i.3; namely, we have seen how the
k-instanton eld strength can look like a supergravity propagator for k > 1. for this to happen,
the dominant k-instanton saddle-point conguration needed to look like k instantons not only
living in mutually commuting su(2)s, but also sharing a common size and 4-position, precisely
as we found in sec. v.3.

next we consider g8 and g4. in order to calculate the corresponding insertions e ab and qab
one needs to utilize the adhm expression for the scalar elds aab(x) as given in sec. ii.7. for
present purposes we need to saturate only the supersymmetric and the superconformal fermion
zero modes by the insertions. neglecting the other modes, one easily nds:

iaab 

2(cid:0)a  a

  
k

 (x  x)k(cid:1)mn 

 (cid:0)b

   bl

   (x  x)l(cid:1) vmn ,

(6.9)

where vmn, in turn, is replaced by the saddle-point expression (6.4). the computation of g4
and g8 proceeds similarly to the computation of g16. note that only the ab term in e ab
is needed in the leading semiclassical evaluation of g8, as the aaabac term is suppressed by a
power of the coupling g (as a careful rescaling of the component elds conrms). in particular,
the k-instanton insertions are again trivially related to their one-instanton counterparts:

.

(6.10)

e(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k-inst

,

= k  e(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)1-inst

q(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k-inst

= k  q(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)1-inst

once again, thanks to these proportionality relations, the space-time dependence of the corre-
lators at the k-instanton level will be identical to the one-instanton dependence. furthermore,
the relations (6.10) account for a factor of k8 and k4 in g8 and g4, which conspires with the
expression (5.45) to produce the leading semiclassical approximation (1.14) to the expected
modular forms f8(,  ) and f4(,  ), respectively, as in eq. (1.18). it follows that, just as with
g16, the large-n yang-mills results for g8 and g4 are in perfect agreement with the supergrav-
ity expectations [34], order by order in the instanton expansion. for g4, there is an identical
contribution from anti-instantons at the same order in g2, as noted previously.

72

vi.2 kaluza-klein modes on s5 and yang-mills correlators

next let us consider the general problem of n-point functions in which the insertions contain
more than sixteen grassmann modes. of course, sixteen of these must be used to saturate the
exact supersymmetric and superconformal modes, as in sec. vi.1. the question becomes how,
in large n, to select the remaining, lifted, fermion zero modes.

to answer this question, we need to analyze the eective n dependence of these modes. in
analogy with the bosonic quantities (6.2a)-(6.2b), it is useful to think of the unbroken a and
a modes themselves as arising from a saddle-point evaluation:

ma

  4a

 1[k][k] ,

 a  4 a1[k][k] .

(6.11)

indeed, the rescaling (5.40) implies that the remaining, uctuating, modes in ma and  a
(which were denoted ma and  a in sec. v.3) are subleading compared to a and a by a
factor of n1/8. there remain the modes a and a, which are distinct from the others in that
they carry an su(n) index u. from their coupling to the a eld in eq. (4.51), together with
the rescaling (5.4), one sees that each ab pair in an insertion, for a xed, unsummed value
of the index u, costs a factor of n 1/2; however, summing on u (as required by gauge invariance)
then turns this n 1/2 suppression into an n 1/2 enhancement. in other words, a and a factors
in the insertions should each be thought of as being enhanced by n 1/4. the large-n rule of
thumb for choosing fermionic collective coordinates in gauge-invariant correlators is now clear:
as many of the modes as possible should be a and a modes, subject to sixteen of the modes
being a and a modes to saturate these grassmann integrations.

with this rule of thumb in hand, let us examine a specic set of correlators of special interest
to the ads/cft correspondence. in sec. vi.1, we were concerned with correlation functions
of operators which on the supergravity side involved no dependence on the position on s5. in
this subsection, we will show that the dependence of operators on the position on s5 is encoded
on the yang-mills side in the dependence of the operators on the variables a and a. as
just alluded to, our discussion will further elucidate the mysterious role played by the auxiliary
variables a. in general, operators depend upon the grassmann variables a and a which (we
have seen) dominate in large n; however, gauge invariant operators can only depend on the
gauge invariant k  k matrix combinations ab. we now prove that, to leading order in n,
such a combination, in the nal integral with respect to the measure (5.45) is replaced by

2gn 1/2

i

ab 

abcd cd1[k][k] ,

(6.12)

where the n 1/2 dependence has already been noted. to this end, consider a general insertion
with a string of such combinations a1b1      apbp. we must insert this expression
into the measure before the  integrals have been performed, i.e. into (4.1). performing the 
integrals as in (4.51) in the presence of the insertion leads to a modied expression involving

73

factors of 1 which can be derived by considering


a1b1     
xt

(det4kx)n2k(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=

apbp

(6.13)

where t acts on instanton indices and the ellipsis represent terms of lower order in n. this
shows that, after performing the  integrals, a term of the form ab is replaced by (gn/8i)(1)ba,
to leading order. now we rescale  as in (5.4), and replace it with its saddle-point value (5.21)
to give (6.12). the replacement shows that dependence on the position on s5 is associated on
the yang-mills side as dependence on combination ab, where we recall from sec. iv.3 that
the {a, a} are superpartners of the iso-orientation of the multi-instanton.

we now consider, a class of operators which depend on the a and b in an essential way. on
the supergravity side, for simplicity, we will restrict our attention to a single supergravity eld,
the dilaton, (x, , ). although the dilaton is a single massless scalar eld in ten dimensions,
it yields an innite tower of massive elds in ve dimensions via kaluza-klein reduction on s5.
this dimensional reduction amounts to expanding  in partial waves as,

(x, , ) =



xp=0

a1a2ap( ) ,

(6.14)

where the scalar spherical harmonics for s5 are dened in terms of the unit vector a as,

a1a2...ap( ) = a1
y (p)

a2    ap  traces .

(6.15)

the eld (n)
symmetric traceless tensor representation of so(6).

a1a2...ap has ve dimensional mass m2 = p(p + 4)l2 and transforms in the pth

the ads/cft correspondence suggests that each of these kaluza-klein modes is associated
with an operator o(p)
a1a2ap in n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory which transforms in the
same irreducible representation of so(6)r and has scaling dimension  = p + 4. the required
operators were identied in [3, 4] as,

o(p)
a1a2ap(x) = trn(cid:2)(ra)a1(ra)a2    (ra)apv2

mn(cid:3)  traces .

here, r is an so(6) rotation such that  = r1 (0) where (0) is a reference point (e.g. the
north pole). the explicit relation (1.5) between gauge theory and type iib supergravity
correlators suggests [34] that we should compare the yang-mills instanton contributions to the
gauge theory correlators, ho(p1)(x1)  o(pr)(xr)ofi with the d-instanton contributions to the
following boundary correlation functions on the supergravity side of the correspondence,

(6.17)

here, of represents an additional fermionic operator insertion which is present to saturate
the exact sixteen zero modes of the multi-instanton and f are the corresponding insertions in

74

the supergravity correlator. another requirement for these latter operator insertions is that
they do not contain a or a modes (otherwise the complicated issue of cross terms with the
other insertions arises). for instance, of could be a product of sixteen composite operators
a
 considered in sec. vi.1.29 the appropriate bulk-to-boundary propagator for a eld which
transforms in a non-trivial representation so(6), and has scaling dimension  = p + 4, is that
which we would expect for an so(6) singlet operator, as in (1.8), augmented by the appropriate
spherical harmonic for the representation in question. hence the external leg corresponding to
the eld insertion (p)
a1a2ap(x,  = 0, (p)) at the boundary, with the interior point (x, , ),
comes with the propagator

kp+4(x, ; x, 0)y (p)

a1a2ap(r(p) ) ,

(6.18)

where we have dened the so(6) rotation r(p) such that (p) = (r(p))1 (0). as before, we
can now identify the degrees-of-freedom of a multi-instanton at large n, with those describing
a d-instanton on ads5  s5. since, we have already demonstrated the equality between the
measures, it remains only to demonstrate that replacing the operators o(p) by their classical
values in the multi-instanton background at large n is equivalent to the d-instanton feynman
rule (6.18) for the dual operators (p).

taking into account that the supersymmetric and superconformal modes are saturated by
the unspecied insertion of , let us set these variables to zero in the scalar eld. consequently,
at leading order,

iaab = u

where we have made use of the large-n behavior of l in (6.2a). we can now nd the appropriate
form for the operator (6.16) by taking the trace of a string of scalar elds and v2
mn. notice that
in the replacement (6.12), the combination ab is o(n 1/2), hence the leading order term in
the operator comes from the product of p bottom-right-hand corners of (6.19). note that the
product of p top-left-hand corners of (6.19), which potentially gives a contribution of the same
order, is canceled against the 0 in the top-left-hand corner of the adhm matrix in (6.4). so

denition; see eq. (2.60).

vii comments and conclusions

vii.1 living large in a large-n world

prior to the recent applications to supersymmetric theories, the multi-instanton program has
had a checkered history (see sec. i of ref. [76]). on the positive side, the most noteworthy
technical achievements include the adhm construction of the full space of k-instanton solutions
[9] as well as the fermion zero modes and propagators in the adhm background [46]. on the
negative side, the adhm construction has the major drawback that the collective coordinate
matrix a is highly overcomplete, and must be accompanied by the nonlinear constraints (2.20a)
which are only explicitly resolvable for k  3 [75,92]. a closely related problem was the lack of a
collective coordinate measure beyond k = 2 [76]. largely as a consequence of these diculties,
the adhm construction languished for many years as a largely mathematical achievement
with virtually no practical application to quantum eld theory. instead, much of the multi-
instanton work in the physics community focused on the dilute instanton gas regime where
single-instanton methods suce and these obstructions do not appear. unfortunatelyby any
measuresuccessful phenomenological applications to qcd require an instanton density much
greater than this regime allows, as well as considerations of congurations of instantons and
anti-instantons [93].

the addition of supersymmetry improves this situation substantially. on the one hand, as
reviewed in sec. iv.1, the fact that the bosonic and fermionic small-uctuations determinants
cancel, together with the stringent requirement of supersymmetric invariance, means that the
collective coordinate integration measure can be xed uniquely [45, 49, 82]. on the other hand,
a host of new exact solutions to the low-energy dynamics of models with extended supersym-
metry have been proposed [25, 27] which have the property that physical measurables receive
contributions from all orders in multi-instantons. these testable predictions have provided

76

fresh impetus for explicit adhm calculations [26, 47, 81] which in certain cases have suggested
emendations to the original solutions.

as the present paper demonstrates, the situation improves even more dramatically when
supersymmetric adhm calculus is accompanied by the large-n limit. common lore holds that
instanton physics is unimportant in this limit [94]; after all, a single instanton is weighted by
the factor exp(82/g2) = exp(82n/(g2n)), which vanishes rapidly as n   with xed
t hooft coupling g2n. in the present paper, we have been considering quantities which get all
their contributions from instantons, except for tree and one-loop eects. they are indeed tiny
contributions at large n, as the standard lore would have it, but nevertheless non-zero and
with a precise, calculable, form xed by the ads/cft correspondence.

as we have seen, with the additional ingredient of large n, the multi-instanton series can
be evaluated explicitly, for the rst time in a four-dimensional theory. we envision that the
simplications in multi-instanton calculus in this limit will have widespread applications, and
are therefore worth emphasizing. let us enumerate the various lessons we have learned at large
n:

(i) a signicant calculational advantage of the gauge-invariant measure introduced in sec. iv.3

is that the adhm constraints (2.20a), which are quadratic constraints in terms of the original
collective coordinates w, become linear constraints (hence trivially resolvable) in terms of the
gauge-invariant variables w. however, the gauge-invariant form of the measure is only available
for k  n/2 (see eqs. (4.28) and (4.30)). the large-n limit (with k xed, or at least k growing
more slowly than n/2) is therefore the regime in which these nonlinear constraintswhich, we
reiterate, have been the main technical impediment to progress in adhm calculusentirely
disappear.

(ii) the detailed saddle-point analysis of secs. v.2-v.3 conrms ones initial intuition regard-
ing k-instanton congurations at large n, namely, that the dominant congurations consist of
k single instantons embedded in mutually commuting su(2) subgroups of su(n). since this
conclusion follows from statistics alone, we expect it to hold equally for other gauge theories
at large n. in this respect the large-n solutions are dilute-gas-like as, in the absence of other
component elds, instantons that live in mutually commuting su(2)s do not interact.

(iii) more surprisingand perhaps special to the n = 4 theory at large nis that these
k instantons live on top of one another in space-time, and share a common scale size. in this
respect, and in sharp contrast to (ii), the large-n limit is the opposite of the dilute instanton
gas regime. from the seemingly schizophrenic features (ii) and (iii) there follows a pleasing
simplication unique to large n, discussed in sec. vi.1: classical insertions into gauge-invariant
correlators can simply be replaced by k times the corresponding one-instanton insertion.

(iv) another remarkable feature of large n is that the auxiliary variables a, a = 1, . . . , 6,

77

introduced merely as a mathematical convenience in order to bilinearize the four-fermion inter-
action (3.2), become conned to s5 in the limit n  . as such, they provide a window
from the yang-mills theory into the ten-dimensional geometry of the string theory.

(v) finally, the 1/n expansion justies the truncation at the quartic level of the small-
uctuations action about the ads5 s5 saddle-point. one of the principal results of this paper
is that this truncated action precisely describes n = 1 ten-dimensional yang-mills theory
dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions. since the latter theory is also the d-instanton
measure (4.13), this is yet another unexpected window from large-n yang-mills theory into
ten-dimensional string theory.

vii.2 comments on the nonrenormalization theorem, and on higher-

order corrections in 1/n and in g2

as discussed in sec. i.1, the comparison between the yang-mills and supergravity pictures
elucidated herein can be quantitative if and only if there exists a nonrenormalization theorem
that allows one to relate the small g2n to the large g2n behavior of chiral correlators such as gn,
as has been suggested in refs. [44]. in the absence of such a theorem the best one can hope for is
that qualitative features of the agreement persist beyond leading order while the exact numerical
factor in each instanton sector does not, in analogy with the mismatch in the numerical prefactor
between weak and strong coupling results for black-hole entropy [3]. in our view, however, our
present results provide strong evidence in favor of such a nonrenormalization theorem for the
correlators gn, for the following reason. consider the planar diagram corrections to the leading
semiclassical (i.e. g2n  0) result for, say, g16, eq. (6.8). in principle, these would not only
modify the above result by an innite series in g2n, but also, at each order in this expansion,
and independently for each value of k, they would produce a dierent function of space-time.
the fact that the leading semiclassical form for g16 that we obtain is not only k-independent,
but already reproduces the space-time dependent of the d-instanton/supergravity prediction
exactly, strongly suggests that such diagrammatic corrections (planar and otherwise) must
vanish. nevertheless there are necessary subleading corrections, both in 1/n and in g2, to our
leading semiclassical results, as follows.

in the one-instanton sector, the complete series expansion in 1/n, at xed leading order in
g, is encapsulated in the exact expression (1.26). at the multi-instanton level, the analogous
1/n corrections are encoded instead in the exact formula for the measure in (4.55). it may be
that the variables w 0 can be integrated out (as at large n) to leave a dimensional reduction
of a ten-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with a generalized action that
is some non-trivial function of n. the action could then be expanded in 1/n with a leading
term that is the conventional su(k) yang-mills action of (5.42). it is conceivable that the more
general action is of the born-infeld type [95].

78

finally let us consider the source of g2 corrections. as is clear from eqs. (1.11)-(1.12), these
corrections are absolutely necessary if (as we fully expect) the yang-mills expression for the
correlator gn is to sum to the complete modular form fn(,  ), and not merely reproduce the
leading semiclassical approximation thereto. yet how can such corrections be compatible with
the nonrenormalization theorem postulated above? we believe that the g2 corrections arise,
not from conventional feynman diagrams in the multi-instanton background, but rather from
the fact that the instanton supermultiplet constructed herein is not an exact solution to the
coupled euler-lagrange equations. this important point, which we stressed at the beginning
of sec. ii, stems from the fact that we have included for convenience all the fermion zero
modes in the collective coordinate matrix ma, and not just the exact supersymmetric and
superconformal modes. as discussed in sec. ii, this approach has the calculational advantage
that the quadrilinear action (3.2) is automatically generated at leading order. but it also
implies that the coupled euler-lagrange equations must be solved iteratively, order by order in
g. in particular, at the next order, the antigauginos a turn on, as do the auxiliary supereld
components d and f ; these, in turn, back-react on the classical component elds already
constructed in sec. ii, resulting in corrections to the multi-instanton action. we expect these
corrections to sum to the appropriate modular forms, but such checks lie beyond the scope of
the present paper. however, it seems likely that these corrections will be much simpler than
ordinary perturbation theory in the instanton background.

appendix a: cliord algebras and fermions in 4, 6 and 10
dimensions

in the appendix we establish connections between the cliord algebras and fermions in
various dimensions of interest to us. our conventions for such representations are taken from
[96].

to begin with we establish representations for the d = 4 and d = 6 cliord algebras in
euclidean space.30 first of all, in d = 4 we take the representation of the gamma matrices from

30as such we shall not distinguish between upper and lower vector indices.

(a.1)

where we implicitly assume the analytic continuation to euclidean space (0, i)  (0, ii).
in d = 6 we introduce an analogous representation of the form

a =(cid:18) 0 a
0 (cid:19) ,

a

7 =(cid:18)1 0
1(cid:19) ,

(a.2)

where the 4  4 dimensional matrices a and a, a = 1, . . . , 6, are most conveniently dened
in terms of the t hooft eta symbols [73]:

where [73] for c = 1, 2, 3:

(a.6)

from these representations in 4 and 6 dimensions, we wish to build representations of the
d = 10 cliord. we shall need two dierent representations for secs. 4.2 and 5.2. first of
all we must explain some of the subtleties of dening majorana-weyl fermions in d = 10.
majorana fermions can only be properly dened in minkowski space in d = 10, so we start with
a hermitian representation ,  = 0, . . . , 9, of the d = 10 cliord algebra. the coupling of a
32 components fermion to a vector is given by . the majorana condition on fermions is
 = c t , with  = 0, where c is the charge conjugation matrix dened such that for the
euclidean space gamma matrices (0  i0) we have  = c1c. at this stage we can

80

continue back to euclidean space and simply treat the euclidean majorana fermion  as real
(since we never have to make use of its complex conjugate). in euclidean space the coupling
of a majorana fermion to a vector is

t (c1)t .

(a.7)

this coupling is not actually real, and the resulting hamiltonian is not hermitian. however,
this is not inconsistent because the relevant requirement in euclidean quantum eld theory is
osterwalder-schrader reection positivity rather than hermiticity. from now on we work in
euclidean space.

the charge conjugation matrix in d = 10 is

c = c (6)  c (4) =(cid:18) 0 i

0 (cid:19) (cid:18)i2

i

0

0

i2(cid:19) ,

the representation of the d = 10 cliord algebra needed in sec. 4.2, is built as follows:

where n = 0, . . . , 3 and a = 1, . . . , 6. in this representation

n = 1[8][8]  n,

a+3 = a  5,

11 = 7  5 .

(a.8)

(a.9)

(a.10)

a majorana-weyl spinor of positive chirality in d = 10 satises 11 = . in this basis,  can
be decomposed as,

 =r

2 (cid:18)0

1(cid:19)  (cid:18)ma

0 (cid:19) + r 



2 (cid:18)1

0(cid:19)  (cid:18) 0

a(cid:19) ,

 

(a.11)

where m and  are weyl spinors both of so(4) and of so(6). m and  have positive and
negative chirality with respect to both groups, respectively.

the representation of the d = 10 cliord algebra that is needed in sec. 5.3 is somewhat
dierent. the fermion coupling (5.39) can be written precisely as in eq. (5.37) with a rotated
representation of the six-dimensional gamma matrices that depends on a. we dene an so(6)
rotation matrix r, rrt = 1, such that a = rab b lies entirely along, say, the rst direction,
i.e. a  a1. in the new basis, we have a representation of the d = 6 cliord algebra a = rabb.
in the rotated basis, we can construct a representation of the d = 10 cliord algebra as

follows:

n = 1  n,

3+a = a (cid:0)a15 + (1  a1)1[4][4](cid:1) ,

(a.12)

where n = 0, . . . , 3 and a = 1, . . . , 6. the representation of the d = 10 cliord algebra that
appears in the text is then found by un-doing the rotation on the d = 6 subspace:

3+a = (r1)ab3+b .

(a.13)

81

in this basis

11 = 7  1[4][4],

(a.14)

and a positive chirality weyl fermion in d = 10 is decomposed as a positive chirality weyl
fermion in d = 6 which is a dirac fermion in d = 2. with the correct normalization to reproduce
the fermion coupling in the text, the d = 10 majorana-weyl fermion  has components

 = n 1/8r 

2g(cid:18)0

1(cid:19)   1/2 ma
1/2  a ! .
