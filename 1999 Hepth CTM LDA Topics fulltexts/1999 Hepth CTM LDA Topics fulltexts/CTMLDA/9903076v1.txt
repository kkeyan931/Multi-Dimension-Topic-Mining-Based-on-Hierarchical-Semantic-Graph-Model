negative dimensional integration method (ndim) is revealing itself as a very useful technique
for computing feynman integrals, massless and/or massive, covariant and non-covariant alike. up
to now, however, the illustrative calculations done using such method are mostly covariant scalar
integrals, without numerator factors. here we show how those integrals with tensorial structures can
also be handled with easiness and in a straightforward manner. however, contrary to the absence of
signicant features in the usual approach, here the ndim also allows us to come across surprising
unsuspected bonuses.
in this line, we present two alternative ways of working out the integrals
and illustrate them by taking the easiest feynman integrals in this category that emerges in the
computation of a standard one-loop self-energy diagram. one of the novel and as yet unsuspected
bonus is that there are degeneracies in the way one can express the nal result for the referred
feynman integral.

i. introduction

in an eort to make sense of diverging integrals that popped out in the eld theoretical approach to transition
amplitudes, scattering matrices and so forth, physicists introduced and developed the concept of extended dimensions
[1]. this can be interpreted in a pragmatic way as a mere artifact to go around a dicult problem. nonetheless
though it may be so, the principle of analytic continuation behind it is mathematically well-founded and established,
being self-consistent and well-dened. thus, if we are allowed to say that the beauty and the power of mathematics
reside in the possibility of dening abstract entities that have no real connection to our physical world, and from
such entities which one could rightfully call outside of this world we can draw either some sense from it or even
pertinent and meaningful properties that become relevant to our dimensionality, then the eort to go to these frontiers
is worthwhile and enriching. in a very personal way of viewing things, we think of ndim in such terms.

we then play with negative dimensions and with precise analytic continuations, so that interesting results do emerge
from our exploration of this kind of realm. a very useful technique stemming from such incursion is the method of
integrating feynman integrals in negative dimensions [2]. instead of the usual eld propagators in the denominator
of the integrands, here we have them as numerators. in other words, in essence what we have here are integrands of
polynomial type. of course, once the integral is performed in negative dimensions, it must be analytically continued
back to our real, positive dimensional world. the basis for doing this is set forth in our previous papers [35].

our aim in this work is to further illustrate the methodology of ndim and for this purpose we take examples from
the one-loop vacuum polarization tensor diagram which generates some feynman integrals with tensorial structures.
we show that the calculation of integrals with tensorial structures can be dealt with propriety using the ndim
technology. moreover, we show that this can be approached in at least two ways, which we consider with details in
the next sections. a rst approach is to just copy the steps used in the traditional positive dimensional approach, i.e.,
using derivative identities in the integrands. a second, novel approach is to dene the relevant negative dimensional
integral corresponding to the feynman integral we want to evaluate right from the beginning and proceed from there.
just to make the illustrations simpler and clearer, we restrict ourselves to massless elds, but generalization to massive
ones is not dicult to do.

ii. using differential identities

let us rst consider the following (vectorial) feynman integral:

i  = z d2q

q

q2 (q  p)2

,

1

(1)

which clearly emerges in the calculation of vacuum polarization tensor of, e.g., quantum electrodynamics. this, of
course, is easily calculated in the standard procedure of positive dimensions. how is this done in the ndim context?
the structure of the above integral immediately suggests that a possible way of starting o ndim calculation is to

consider a gaussian-like integral of the type

this, in terms of the negative dimensional integral i (i, j, d; p) is therefore given by

g = z d2dq q eq2(qp)2

.

g =

=



xi,j=0
xi,j=0



(1)i+j i j

i! j! z d2dq q (q2)i [(q  p)2]j

(1)i+j i j
i! j!

i (i, j, d; p) .

(2)

(3)

on the other hand, performing the momentum integration of equation (2) through the use of the following identity,

q e2qp =

1
2



p

e2qp ,

(4)

(5)

we get

g =




exp(cid:18)

 


p2(cid:19)

p (cid:16) 

(cid:17)d
xx,a,b=0



= pd

(1)x (x  d  1)!

x+a x+b+1

(p2)x

a! b!

x!

a+b,x+d+1 ,

where  =  + .

comparison between equations (3) and (5) term by term yields the result for i (i, j, d; p). after analytic continu-

ation to positive dimensions and negative values of exponents (i, j) [4], we get

i  = i 

ac

= d p (p2) (i|) (j| + 1)
(|2 + d + 1)

.

where we have used  = i + j + d and the denition for pochhammers symbols

(i|)  (i) =

(i + )

()

.

next, we consider the tensorial feynman integral

i  = z d2q

q q

q2 (q  p)2

,

the procedure is completely analogous, now starting from

here we are going to quote only the nal result, which reads

g = z d2dq q q eq2(qp)2

.

i  = i 
ac

= d (p2) (cid:26)p p (i|) (j| + 2)

(|2 + d + 2)



g p2

2

(i| + 1) (j| + 1)

(  1|2 + d + 3)(cid:27) .

in a similar manner, we can evaluate the following integrals very easily:

2

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

i  = i 
ac

= d (p2) (cid:26) p2 t 

2

(i| + 1) (j| + 2)
(  1|2 + d + 4)

+ p p p (i|) (j| + 3)

(|2 + d + 3)(cid:27) .

where t  = p g + p g + p g, and

i  = i 
ac

= d (p2) (cid:26) p4 a

4

a +

p2 b

2

b + pppp p(cid:27) ,

where

a 

b 

p 

(i| + 2) (j| + 2)
(  2|2 + d + 6)
(i| + 1) (j| + 3)
(  1|2 + d + 5)
(i|) (j| + 4)
(|2 + d + 4)

(11)

(12)

(13)

with a = g g + g g + g g and b = ppg + permutations. all these results agree with those given
in the apendix a of [6].

iii. using pure ndim technique

in order to calculate tensorial structures in feynman integrals, we can adopt another alternative approach. let us

consider the following integral:

j = z d2dq

(2q  p)l

q2 (q  p)2

,

l  0

(14)

of course, for l > 0 the tensorial structure is implicit, being contracted with external vector p. the advantage of

this approach is that it takes care of all the tensorial structures at the same time.

so, instead of using equation (2) or equation (9), etc. as our starting point, the structure of the feynman integrals
in equation (1) and equation (8) also suggests another possible way of dening the gaussian-like integral of interest
to begin with, namely,

this denes the negative dimensional integral j (i, j, l, d; p) as follows:

h = z d2dq eq2(qp)2(2qp) .

h =

=



xi,j,l=0
xi,j,l=0



(1)i+j+l i j l

i! j! l! z d2dq (q2)i [(q  p)2]j (2q  p)l

(1)i+j+l i j l
i! j! l!

j (i, j, l, d; p) .

on the other hand, from (15) we get also

h = d



xx,...,b=0

a+b=d

(1)x+y 2y (  d)! (p2)

a! b! x! y! z!

x+ax+y+by+2z

(15)

(16)

(17)

where   x + y + z = i + j + l + d, or  =  + l.

therefore, the solution for j (i, j, l, d; p) is obtained from the solving of a system of linear algebraic equations of

the following form [4]:

3

i = x + a
j = x + y + b
l = y + 2z
 = x + y + z

(18)




it is very easy to see that the above system is formed by four equations but ve unknowns (the sum indices
x, y, z, a, b). therefore, it can only be solved in terms of one of the sum indices x, y, z, a, or b. for each of these
remnant indices, the sum yields 3f2 hypergeometric functions of unit argument, as follows:

where the set {s} = {x, yeven, yodd, z, a, b}1, with

j ac

{s} = {s} 3f2(a, b, c ; e, f | 1 )

x = d (2p2)l (4p2)i+j+d

observe that in the process of analytic continuation to our physical world (d > 0), exponents i, j are analytically
continued to allow for negative values, whereas the exponent l must be left untouched, since, by denition l  0 in
the original feynman integral [7].

one of the interesting features of the ndim technique is that it can give rise to degenerate solutions for the same
feynman integral. all the answers we have above, although seemingly distinct, are in fact only dierent ways of
expressing the same thing. this means that for this particular case, where the solutions are degenerate, taking one of
them will suce. the equivalence of the dierent forms in which the solutions are expressed is shown in the appendix.
since we have this freedom of choice, looking at the hypergeometric functions whose parameters are listed in the
table, we see that the most convenient solution is given by the one coming from solving the system in terms of the
summation index z. the reason for this is based on the fact that two of its numerator parameters, namely b =  1
2 l
and c =  1

2 , readily leads to truncated series for l = even and l = odd respectively. then

2 l + 1

j = j ac

(i  j  d|2i + 2j + l + 3d)

2l

= d (p2)
 3f2(cid:18)j + d, 

now it remains for us to check the results we obtained so far by assigning explicit values for the exponents i, j, and
l in (6), (10), (11), (12) and (26). let us begin with i = j = 1 in (6), and in order to facilitate the comparison, we
shall compute

2p i (1, 1, d; p) = 2 d (p2)d1 (d) (d  1) (2  d)

(2d  1)

.

(27)

this result is to be compared with the one coming from equation (26) for the particular case when i = j = 1,
and l = 1. it can be seen straight away that the numerator parameter  1
2 of the hypergeometric function 3f2
vanishes for the particular value l = 1, so that only the rst term, that is one, in the series dening it is relevant, and

2 l + 1

j(1, 1, 1, d; p) = 2 d (p2)d1 (1|d  1) (1|d  2)

(2  d|3d  3)

,

(28)

which is, of course, exactly equal to equation (27) as it should be.

from (10) we get (after contracting it with 4 p p):

4p p i  (1, 1, d; p) = 4d (p2)d (cid:26)1 

1

2d(cid:27) (d + 1) (d  1) (2  d)

(2d)

.

(29)

this now is to be compared to the result coming from equation (26) for the particular case when i = j = 1, and

l = 2.

j(1, 1, 2, d; p) = 4 d (p2)d (1|d) (1|d  2)

; d (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(30)

note that the a and f parameters coalesce into the same value d  1, so that the 3f2 becomes a 2f1 hypergeometric
2 l turns out to be a negative integer unity for l = 2, so that the

function. moreover the numerator parameter b =  1
series truncate at the second term, and the nal result is exactly equal to the rhs of equation (29).

in a completely analogous way, we get from (11) contracted with 8 ppp

8pppi (1, 1, d, p) = 8d(p2)d+1 (d  1)(d + 2)(2  d)

(2d + 1)

(cid:26)1

2(d + 1)(cid:27)

while from (26) with i = j = 1 and l = 3 we get

j(1, 1, 3, d, p) = 8d(p2)d+1 (1|d + 1)(1|d  2)
(2  d|3d  1)

iv. conclusion

we have shown in this paper how we can work out feynman integrals with tensorial structures in the context of
ndim. there are two equivalent approaches for doing this, either by using dierential identities to work them out
one by one (vector, rank two tensor, and so on) mirroring the positive dimensional technique, or by using pure ndim
methodology to get simultaneous results. the former technique does not bring any new feature while the latter one
allows us to get this new feature of degenerate solutions, plus the bonus of having them all at once. as we have
noticed before [4], the pure ndim methodology shows itself more powerful in that it gives equivalent forms of a
six-fold degenerate solution for the integral. and not only this, the solutions we get are simultaneously obtained.

v. appendix

in this appendix, we shall show in great detail the equivalence of the six solutions generated by the pure ndim
technology in the computation of the one-loop feynman integrals with tensorial structures in the numerator. in order
its corresponding 3f z
to do this, let us rst consider the solution j ac
2 hypergeometric function has parameters
given in the table of section iii. it is clear from its parameter bz =  1
2 l that for l = even = 2m, m = 0, 1, 2, ...
the hypergeometric function is actually a truncated series. in a similar way, from its parameter cz =  1
2 for
l = odd = 2m + 1, m = 0, 1, 2, ... the hypergeometric function is also a truncated series.

2 l + 1

.

z

truncated hypergeometric series of the form pfq, p = q + 1 can be inverted [8,9] from variable, say,  into 1. for
the particular case of 3f2 with unit argument, such inversion leads to an identity between them. this is expressed in
a shorthand notation as

where

and

(e  c)(f  c)fp(0; 4, 5) = ()m(1  a)(1  b)fn(3; 1, 2)

fp(0; 4, 5) = 3f2(a, b, c ; e, f | 1)

(s)(e)(f )

,

fn(3; 1, 2) = 3f2(1 + c  e, 1 + c  f, c ; 1  a + c, 1  b + c | 1)

(s)(1  a + c)(1  b + c)

6

(35)

(36)

(37)

with m denoting the negative integer numerator parameter, and s = e + f  a  b  c.

another way of writing this up is (for general variable )

3f2(m, 1, 2 ; c, 1| ) = m 3f2(m, 1, 2 ; 1, 2 | 1),

(38)

where

1 = 1  m  c
2 = 1  m  1
1 = 1  m  1
2 = 1  m  2

m =

(1|m) (2|m) (z)m

(c|m) (1|m)

let us rst separate the even/odd sectors of j z

and for l = odd = 2m + 1 , m = 0, 1, 2, ... we dene

2 = 3f2(cid:18)m, m 
3f odd

in a completely analogous way, starting from 3f odd
therefore, when equation (38) is applied to our case in j z

2 we arrive at j y,odd
ac .

l = even sector of j z
the y = odd sector, j y,odd
to use the duplication formula for the gamma function.

ac with  = 1 it lead us to the following conclusion: the
ac yields exactly the y = even sector, j y,even
ac yields exactly
ac
ac . in order to arrive at these identities, in the intermediate steps of the calculation one needs

, whereas the l = odd sector of j z

another identity between 3f2 hypergeometric functions of unity argument is given by [8,9]:

where fp(0; 4, 5) is dened in (36) and

fp(0; 4, 5) = fp(0; 2, 3)

fp(0; 2, 3) = 3f2(e  a, f  a, s ; s + b, s + c | 1)

(46)

(47)

plugging in the parameters of the 3f z

above yields

(0; 4, 5) = (1  a) (1  f + b) (1  e + b) fp(1; 0, 2)

then we have

fp(1; 0, 2) = 3f2(1  a, 1  f + b, 1  e + b ; 2  s  a, 1  a + b | 1)

we do not need to be overly concerned about the n factor since both m and n are ratios of gamma functions

that at the end can be rearranged conveniently to yield the desired factor present in the j x
after some algebraic manipulation of this sort we have j z

ac = j x
ac .
in a similar manner, if we interchange parameters a and b in f new
ac = j b
p
lastly, for terminating 3f2 hypergeometric series with parameter c = m, the following identity is veried [8,9]

(0; 4, 5) and proceed as above, we get j z
