abstract

in this work, we explain how the integrable technology can be brought to
bear to gain insight in the nature of the distribution of the spectrum of coupled
hermitean random matrices (of nite size) and the equations the associated
probabilities satisfy. given two intervals, the joint statistics 1
n log pn(e1  e2)
for the spectra of two coupled gaussian random matrices satisfy very simple
non-linear third-order partial dierential equations in the end points of the
intervals e1 and e2; these equations are independent of the size n of the
matrices.

this is based on the 2-toda lattice, its algebra of symmetries and its vertex
operators. namely, the method is to introduce time parameters, in an articial
way, and to dress up a certain matrix integral with a vertex integral oper-
ator, for which we nd virasoro-like dierential equations. combining these
equations with a new partial dierential equation for the two-toda lattice
 -functions leads to that result. in the course of doing this, we also give the
virasoro constraints for certain matrix integrals with arbitrary boundaries.

introduction

the study of the spectrum of coupled random matrices has received rather
little attention. to the best of our knowledge, coupled random matrices have
been studied, to some extent, by mehta in [11, 15, 17]. in this work, we ex-
plain how the integrable technology can be brought to bear to gain insight in
the nature of the distribution of the spectrum of coupled hermitean random
matrices and the equations the associated probabilities satisfy. in particular,
the 2-toda lattice, its algebra of symmetries and its vertex operators will play
a prominent role in this interaction. namely, the method is to introduce time
parameters, in an articial way, and to dress up a certain matrix integral

with a vertex integral operator, for which we nd virasoro-like dierential
equations; for a state of the art survey of these methods, see [20]. these meth-
ods lead to very simple non-linear third-order partial dierential equations for
the joint statistics of the spectra of two coupled gaussian random matrices.

bi-orthogonal polynomials and two-toda lattice: given a weight, de-

for the usual lie algebra splitting ( )u, ( ) , explained in section 2. the familiar
standard toda lattice (on tridiagonal matrices) is a special reduction of the
two-toda lattice, in the same way that the korteweg-de vries equation (kdv)
is a reduction of the kadomtsev-petviashvili equation (kp).

conversely, starting from the the two-toda lattice equations (0.4), one is
lead to wave functions 1 and 
2 and a representation in terms of  -functions
as in (0.1). as will be established in section 3, the functions n satisfy the
standard kp-equation in t and s separately (see the beginning of section 3),
but they also satisfy another (new and useful) equation, which is third-order,
relating t- and s-derivatives, namely:

vertex operators and christoel-darboux kernels: backlund-darboux
transformations refer to the general recipe of factorizing dierential or dier-
ence operators and ipping the factors, to form a new operator. letting
this situation ow in time, the new wave functions (eigenfunctions) can be
expressed in terms of the old ones as wronskians (continuous or discrete),
and the new  -function is expressed in terms of the old ones, by means of
vertex operators. so, the latter can be viewed as generators of backlund-
darboux transformations for dierential or dierence operators at the level of
 -functions. typically, vertex operators x map  -functions into  -functions,
and their squares vanish; although  satises a highly non-linear equation,
vertex operators have an additive property, namely  + x is a  -function as
well!

with the 2-toda lattice, we associate four dierent vertex operators xij(, ),

for 1  i, j  2; they map innite vectors of  -functions into  -vectors, as
explained in section 5. the vertex operators x11 and x22 are basic vertex op-
erators for toda, and kp, as well, whereas x12 and x21 are vertex operators,
native to 2-toda. in particular, we construct

x12(, ) = 1()x(s, )x(t, )(),

3in terms of the wronskian {f, g}t = f

besides this work, the vertex operator x12 will also play a major role in
our later work on symmetric and symplectic matrix integrals. given a 2-toda
lattice  -vector  = (...1, 0, 1, ...), we have that  + x12(y, z) is another  -
vector. but more is true, we show the kernels k12,n(y, z), dened by the ratios
(x12 )n/n, have eigenfunction expansions in terms of the eigenfunctions ,
reminiscent of the christoel-darboux formula for orthogonal polynomials;
to be precise,

the following theorem deals with the joint distribution (section 11),

pn(e) := p (all(m1-eigenvalues)  e1, all(m2-eigenvalues)  e2),

and leads to a formula, which is the mirror image of theorem 0.1.

theorem 0.5 (gaussian probability) the statistics (0.19) satises the

remark 1. since the equation above for the joint statistics is independent
of the size n, the same joint statistics for innite coupled ensembles should
presumably be given by the same partial dierential equation.

remark 2. for e = e1  e2 := (, a]  (, b], equation (0.20) takes
on the following form: upon introducing the new variables x := a + cb, y :=

4in terms of the wronskian {f, g}x = xf.g  f.xg, with regard to a rst order dierential

operator x.

remark 3. equation (0.20) also has a zero-curvature formulation, namely:

[a1  xn, b1  yn] = 0,

(0.21)

with

xn :=

and yn :=

c21

.

the last section deals with coupled matrix ensembles, where the joint
statistics is given by the laguerre distribution. unlike theorem 0.5, the
laguerre case for n  n matrices lead to (inductive) dierential equations for
the matrix integral (0.19);
indeed, the equation contains a term, which is
expressible in terms of the same expression for (n  1)  (n  1) matrices,
instead of n  n.

acknowledgment: we thank taka shiota for many useful discussions concern-
ing fay identities. we also thank edward frenkel for urging us to compute
the central charge for the virasoro algebra dened in theorem 0.3.

ueno and takasaki [18] show that the 2-toda deformations of , and hence

l, can ultimately all be expressed in terms of one sequence of  -functions

finally the pair of matrices w = (w1, w2) satises the bilinear relation

(in the  splitting of (2.1))

(w (t, s)w (t, s)1) = 0

or equivalently

w1(t, s)w1(t, s)1 = w2(t, s)w2(t, s)1,

(2.11)

from which one proves proposition 2.1; for details see [6]. equation (2.13)
below is established in adler-van moerbeke [4].

proposition 2.1 (bi-innite and semi-innite) the wave and adjoint wave
functions satisfy, for all m, n  z (bi-innite) and m, n  0 (semi-innite)
and t, s, t, s  c:

in the semi-innite case, we reinterpret 1 as , where  is the semi-
innite shift operator. then one shows (2.11) and (2.12) are also valid. also
the semi-innite case is obtained from the innite case by setting i = 0 for
i  1 and 0 = 1. then the semi-innite wave vectors

(cid:16)1n(t, s; z)ep tizi(cid:17)n0

and (cid:16)

2n(t, s; z)ep sizi(cid:17)n0

are vectors of polynomials of degree n = 0, 1, 2, ... in z and z1 respectively,
as follows from (2.12); see [2]. in the semi-innite case, we must dene ln
1 
and ln

 for integer n < 0; namely for n  z:

l(n)
1(z)) = +(znep tizi
1 (ep tizi
l(n)
(ep sizi
2(z1)) = +(znep sizi



2

2(z1)),

(2.14)

where + refers to the projection +(piz aizi) = pi0 aizi. observe that

for n  z, n  0; indeed multiplying the vector

of polynomials with zn, n  0 maintains the polynomial charac-

3 bilinear fay identities and a new iden-
tity for two-toda  -functions

two-toda  -functions  (t, s) satisfy the kp-hierarchy in t and s separately,
of which the rst equation reads:

t1(cid:19)4
(cid:18) 

log  + 6 (cid:18) 

t1(cid:19)2

log !2

+ 3(cid:18)

but they also satisfy the following identity:

the proof of this theorem hinges on the bilinear identity, due to ueno-

takasaki [18] and a number of lemmas:

proposition 3.2 2-toda  -functions satisfy the following bilinear identities:

iz=
n(t  [z1], s)m+1(t + [z1], s)ep
=iz=0
n+1(t, s  [z])m(t, s + [z])ep

(3.3)

both, for the bi-innite (n, m  z) and the semi-innite case (n, m  z,
n, m  0).

proof: (3.2) follows at once from proposition 2.1 and the  -function represen-
tations (2.10), whereas (3.3) follows from the shifts t 7 t  a, t 7 t + a, s 7
s  b, s 7 s + b, combined with the denition of the hirota symbol.

proof: set m = n + 1, all bk and ak = 0, except for one aj+1, in the hirota
bilinear relation (3.3). the rst nonzero term in the sum on the left hand side
of that relation, which is also the only one containing aj+1 linearly, reads

comparing the coecients of aj+1 in (3.4) and (3.5) yields

in particular, we have

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

dividing (3.8) and (3.9) leads to the second equality in (3.4). but, according
to (2.13), the (n, n + 1)-entry of lk
1 is given by (3.4). the similar result for
lk

2 is given by the involution

t  s and l1  hl

2 h1.

proof of theorem 3.1: set k = 2 in the identities of proposition 3.3; then
subtracting 
t1

of identity (3.5) from 
s1

of (3.4) leads to theorem 3.1.

1 and hl2

the (n, n + 1)-entries of l2

2 h1 have the following equivalent
expressions, which will be useful in the theory of toeplitz matrices, as ap-
plied to the distribution of the length of the longest increasing sequences of
a random permutation. the second identity, appearing in l2
1 below is an ex-
pression purely in terms of one component n+1, at the expense of introducing
a /t2-derivative; the third identity involves /t1 and /s1 only, but at
the expense of involving nearest neighbors n and n+1.

in the next lemma we show that the christoel-darboux type kernels,
formed by means of the 2-toda wave function (2.10) can be expressed in
terms of vertex operator acting on the  -functions; set x := x(, ):

lemma 5.4 when 1 < || < ||2, the following holds (bi-innite case)

proof of theorem 5.1 and corollary 5.2: in the bi-innite case, the statement
of lemma 5.4 leads at once to (5.3), whereas in the semi-innite case, summing
up the expression (i) of lemma 5.3 yields a boundary term, using the fact that
0 = 1. for (iii) the boundary term vanishes, using 1 = 0. to prove the
rst expansion of corollary, let n   in the (1,1)-entry of (5.4), assuming
|/| < 1. setting n = 0 in the (2,2) and (1,2)-entry of (5.4) yields the second
and third relations of (5.5), after rst stripping the exponential part from the
equation.

proposition 9.4 the vertex operator, dened in (5.2),

x12(u, v) = 1x(s, v)x(t, u)(u)(v)

leads to a virasoro algebra of central charge c = 2,

similarly, the involution u  v, t  s leads to the same virasoro algebra
in s, with same central charge.

proof: noticing that one piece of x12(t, s; u, v) is precisely x(t; u) for  = 1,
we apply proposition 9.3 for  = 1:


u

uk+1x12(t, s; u, v) = (cid:18)

the central charge c = 2 is obtained by setting  = 1 in the general formula

given the moment matrix (over e),

mn(t, s, c) =: (ij)0ijn1 = (hyi, zj ie)0i,jn1,

(10.11)

according to [2, 3], the borel decomposition of the semi-innite matrix15

m = s1

1 s2 with s1  d,0, s2  d0,

with s1 having 1s on the diagonal, and s2 having his on the diagonal, leads to
two strings (p(1)(y), p(2)(z)) of monic polynomials in one variable (dependent
on e), constructed, in terms of the character (z) = (zn)nz,n0, as follows:

p(1)(y) =: s1 (y)

p(2)(z) =: h(s1

2 ) (z).

(10.12)

we call these two sequences bi-orthogonal polynomials; in fact, according to
[3] the borel decomposition of m = s1
1 s2 above is equivalent to the or-
thogonality relations of the polynomials:

hp(1)

n , p(2)

m ie = n,mhn.

(10.13)

the matrices

l1 := s1s1

1 , and l2 := s2s1
2 ,

interact with the vector of string orthogonal polynomials, as follows:

l1p(1)(y) = yp(1)(y)
also dene vectors 1 and 

2, as follows:

(10.15)

as a function of (t, s), the couple l := (l1, l2) satises the two-toda lattice
equations (2.3), and 1 and 
2 satisfy the equations (2.7); remember l, 1
and 

2 all depend on e.

moreover, according to [2], theorem 3.4, the determinant of the moment

matrix can be expressed as a 2n-uple integral over en  r2n:

establishing (10.22).

proof of theorem 10.1: in [2] (see for instance the introduction), we have
shown that the vector  =  r2

according to theorem 9.1 , we also have [vk, (ue)n] = 0 and thus

53

adler-van moerbeke:coupled random

taking the nth component, we nd (vk(ue)n )n = 0 and similarly with vk
replaced by vk. since ((ue)n )n =  e

(11.16)

because of the fact that

log pn(e) = log(n(e)/n(r2)) = log n(e)  log n(r2),

together with the fact that a1n(r2) = b1n(r2) = 0, we have that fn(e) :=

n log pn(e) satises (11.16) as well, thus leading to (11.5).

note that a2 and b2 acting on n depends on the index n.

theorem 12.1 (laguerre distibution) the joint statistics (11.2), namely
pn(e) = n(e)/n(r+), is a ratio of two functions, each satisfying the non-
linear third-order partial dierential equation19 (gn := log n(e)):

(12.4)

remark: equation (12.4) is actually an inductive set of equations with regard
to n, since it contains derivatives of the form n(e)/c21 and n(e)/c12
. the point is that, according to (10.24), these derivatives can be expressed
in terms of (t, s)-derivatives of the expression n1(e) in (12.5) below; to be
precise,

n(e)

c21

= pn+1( t)pn( s)1(e)  n1(e)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=s=cij=0,c11=c

the t, s-partials of n1(e) can then be expressed again in terms the operators
ai, bi applied to n1, etc... .

this result hinges on knowing, as before, the virasoro constraints for the
(t, s) deformations of the matrix integral (12.1). unlike the gaussian case,
which could be obtained by merely shifting the time, we invoke here a method,
due to [5], of representing the matrix integral by vertex operators acting on a
vacuum vector.

here the involution acts as follows:

akn = vkn and bkn = wkn.

(12.9)

evaluating akn, bkn, a1b1n, a2b1n along the locus l, using the com-
mutation relation [a2, w1]|l = c 
and (12.9), and setting dn = n(n +

setting these expressions into equations (11.14), we nd an equation and its
