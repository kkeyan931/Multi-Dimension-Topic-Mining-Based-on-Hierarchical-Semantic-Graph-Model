abstract

1 introduction

noncommutative geometry[1] and quantum groups [2] are of relevance to quantization of
space-time (see, for example, [3, 4, 5] and references therein). another possibility of an
application of noncommutative geometry deals with elds that take values on q-deformed
manifolds, in particular on quantum planes [4] or on quantum groups [6]. these two
approaches are closely related. for example, gauge theory on noncommutative torus is
equivalent to noncommutative gauge theory on the commutative torus. one of motivations
to consider noncommutative eld theories is a hope that it would be possible to cure quantum
eld theory divergences[7, 3, 8].

the renovation of the interest in noncommutative eld theories has been stimulated by
the paper of connes, douglas and schwarz [9], where it was shown that supersymmetric
gauge theory on noncommutative torus is naturally appeared in compactication of matrix
theory [10] (see [11] for further developments). the appearance of noncommutative geometry
in string theory with a nonzero b-eld [9, 12, 13] and explicit construction of a change of
variables that shows an equivalence between ordinary gauge elds [13] and noncommutative
gauge elds raises a question about selfconsistency of noncommutative yang-mills (ncym)
theory. ncym theory is related with deformation quantization, see [14].
in such type
of models ultraviolet divergences are still present [15]. moreover, renormalizability is not

evident for noncommutative eld theories. nonrenormalizability of ncym theory would
mean inconsistency of a string theory in the b-eld background at least at the zero-mode
level. therefore, it is crucial from string point of view to clarify this question. explicit
calculations performed at one-loop level show renormalizability in this approximation [16].
the next orders have not been calculated yet. about a general discussion of renormalizability
see [18].

the goal of this paper is to show renormalizability of the noncommutative scalar the-
ory in two-loop approximation. we will construct explicitly one and two-loop counterterms
and show that renormalized 1pi functions are well-dened for non-exceptional momenta
(compare with ir niteness of renormalized 1pi functions in massless theories). the sim-
ilar calculations for ncym are in progress. note that there are more similarity between
calculations of counterterms in ncym theory and those in charged scalar eld theory [14].
the paper is organized as follows. in sect.2 we formulate the model and explain why we
will work in the language of single-line graphs and symmetric vertices. in sect.3 we present
the one loop calculations and in sect.4 we schematically present two-loop calculations. de-
tails of these calculations are collected in appendix. in the last section we note a problem
with ir divergences for higher loops renormalized 1pi functions (we have this problem in
spite of we deal with a massive theory).

where  is a moyal product (f  g)(x) = ei  f (x)  g(x),  is a deformation parameter,
 is a non-degenerate skew-symmetric real constant matrix, 2 = 1, d is even. p1  p2

sint =

4!(2)d z dp1dp2dp3dp4 eip1p2ip3p4(p1)(p2)(p3)(p4)(p1 + p2 + p3 + p4). (2)

we see the following distinguish features of the deformed theory as compared with standard
local 4

d model:

 there are non-local phase factors in the vertex.

 these factors provide regularization for some loop integrals but not for all [16, 14, 17].

 to have renormalizability the sum of divergences in each order of perturbation theory

must have a phase factor already present in the action.

to single out phase factors it is convenient to use the t hooft double-line graphs and
a notion of planar graphs. for planar graphs the phase factors do not aect the feynman
integrations at all [15]. in particular the planar graphs have exactly the same divergences
as in the commutative theory[17]. there are no supercial divergences in nonplanar graphs
since they are regulated by the phase factors [16, 14, 17, 18]. moreover, oscillating phases
regulate also divergent subgraphs, unless they are not divergent planar subgraphs.

so, at rst sight it seems that the proof of renormalizability is rather trivial. one has
divergences only in planar graphs, so one can use the fact that planar theory is renormalizable

figure 1: planar graph with a nonplanar subgraph

if its scalar counterpart does [20]. or in other words, one can take the planar approximation
of ordinary theory, nd divergences within this approximation and write counterterms in
noncommutative theory as divergent parts of planar graphs multiplied on the phase factors.
however these arguments work only for supercial divergences. the situation is more subtle
for divergent subgraphs. the reason is that a planar graph can contain nonplanar subgraphs
(see simple example on fig.1) and these divergences should be also removed. therefore,
renormalizability of the theory (1) is not obvious.

in explicit calculations we will use single-line graphs and symmetric vertices. after

symmetrization of (2) we get

and the vertex is a sum of three terms (see fig.2).

in this section we will compute explicitly one-loop counterterms using dimensional regular-
ization d = 4  2. we will also present the explicit form of nite part for two point and
four point 1pi functions, (2) and (4), in the one loop approximation. we use the standard

4 two loop counterterms

let us consider (2)
by graph 5c (see appendix b).

2 . the corresponding graphs are shown in fig. 5. graph 5a is compensated

let us consider graph 5b (an explicit expression for this graph is presented in appendix
c, eq.(c.4)). this graph has supercial divergence which is removed by a local counterterm.

figure 5: graphs contributing to (2)
2

also it has divergent subgraphs. considering one of them (fig 6a) (b12 = 0, b1 = 0, b2 6= 0,
i.e. case i) in appendix c) we see that a contribution of this divergent subgraph can be
represented as 6d which is nothing but a non-local tadpole with a one-loop renormalized
coupling constant. this shows the two-loop renormalizability of (2).

figure 6: divergent subgraph of 5b

let us now prove two-loop renormalizability of (4). we have three two-loop graphs
(7a,b,c) and corresponding crossing graphs. in the same order of g there are also graphs
with counterterms, (7d,e,f).

figure 7: a), b) and c) show graphs contributing to (4)
counterterms (cross denotes counterterm (8))

3 ; d), e) and f) show graphs with

graph 7a has only one divergent subgraph and this divergence is compensated by graph
7d. more interesting is a compensation of divergences of graphs 7b and 7c caused by one-
loop divergent subgraphs. as we will see these divergences are compensated by 7e only if we
take the sum of graphs 7b and 7c. indeed, we have equalities presented in g.8. the second
equality in g.8 is due to symmetry under exchange 1  4. so, we have a compensation of
the terms presented in g.7e and 8d. this compensation is checked explicitly in appendix.

therefore, in two loops we have

5 discussion and conclusion

let us compare our counterterms with corresponding counterterms in the ordinary theory.
in one loop for (4)
4 theory. 2
comes from free terms of the trigonometric polynomial (6) and 1/9 is from the vertex. we
have the factor 2/9 also for the one-loop 4-point planar graph. relative factors of divergent
parts of two-loop graphs are collected in the table.

it is obvious that our renormalized 1pi functions do not admit the limit   0. a

behaviour of (2)

for p2  0 is the same as its behaviour for   0. we have

(12)

caused by this asymptotic there are problems with a ir behaviour of graphs with tadpoles.
they produce divergence in the ir region if the number of insertions is more then n > 2
(compare with an example of ref.[21] in [18]).

perhaps, it would be also interesting to develop the theory of noncommutative quantum
(gauge) elds not only on the torus but also on more general manifolds, in particular on
poisson manifolds. perhaps the question of renormalizability of noncommutative quantum
theory on certain poisson manifolds will get a more favourable resolution [14].

after the nishing this paper we became aware of the work by shiraz minwalla, mark van
raamsdonk and nathan seiberg, hep-th/9912072, where mixing of the uv and the ir is
discussed.

12 = 0 and b1 = 0 and b2 6= 0 (for almost all p) and denotepjj(b12,b1)) = pb2
