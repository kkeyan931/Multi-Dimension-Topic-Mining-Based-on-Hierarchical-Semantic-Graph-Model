abstract

according to the ads/cft correspondence, the d = 4, n = 4 su(n) sym is dual to
the type iib string theory compactied on ads5  s 5 . a mechanism was proposed
previously that the chiral anomaly of the gauge theory is accounted for to the leading
order in n by the chern-simons action in the ads5 sugra. in this paper, we consider
the sugra\string action at one loop and determine the quantum corrections to the
chern-simons action. while gluon loops do not modify the coecient of the chern-
simons action, spinor loops shift the coecient by an integer. we nd that for nite
n, the quantum corrections from the complete tower of kaluza-klein states reproduce
exactly the desired shift n 2  n 2  1 of the chern-simons coecient, suggesting that
this coecient does not receive corrections from the other states of the string theory. we
discuss why this is plausible.

1 introduction

s

according to the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3, 4], the n = 4 su(n) supersymmetric
gauge theory considered in the t hooft limit with   g2
y m n xed is dual to the iib string
theory compactied on ads5  s 5 . the parameters of the two theories are identied as
y m = gs,  = (r/ls)4 and hence 1/n = gs(ls/r)4. in general, a gauge theory diagram
g2
with genus g comes with a power of n 22g and with some powers of .
in the string
theory, correlation functions for a given genus g come with a power of g22g
and have a
coecient given by a power series expansion in /r2 = 1/2. at a given order of n
or gs, the functions of  have dierent expansions (powers of  versus powers of 1/2)
in the two theories, although according to the ads/cft proposal, they are supposed
to represent the same function. it is clear that comparison between the two theories is
possible only for quantities whose  dependences can be computed exactly or that are
independent of . since the anomaly is independent of , it is a perfect candidate for this
purpose.
in the n = 4 sym, we have two kinds of anomaly, the trace anomaly and the su(4)r
chiral anomaly. both have been checked [3, 5, 6] and found to match with sugra
calculations to leading order at large n. subleading orders in n for other gauge systems
have also been discussed [7, 8]. however, the 1/n 2 corrections for the original n = 4 case
have never been tested. in this paper, we will be interested in the 1/n 2 corrections to the
chiral anomaly. to leading order in n, the chiral anomaly has been elegantly accounted
for [3, 5] by the chern-simons action in the ads5 sugra. the coecient k (see (9)
below) determines the magnitude of the chiral anomaly in eld theory and is given by
k = n 2 to the leading order in n. for nite n, the chiral anomaly of the su(n) gauge
theory is proportional to n 2  1 and there is a mismatch of -1. our goal is to determine
the 1/n 2 correction to this coecient k and reproduce this -1 correction.

according to the proposal [1, 2, 3], quantities of order 1/n 2 corresponds to a 1-loop string
calculation. although a classical string action on ads5 s 5 with rr elds background is
available [9], the quantization of it is notoriously dicult and we still dont have reliable
means to compute its quantum corrections. this is partially reected by the fact that
we still dont know the complete spectrum of states of the string theory on ads5  s 5 .
the only explicitly known states are the full towers of kk states [10] coming from the
compactication of the 10 dimensional iib sugra multiplet. it is thus natural to rst
examine the quantum corrections to the chern-simons coecient coming from all of these
states. in fact, we nd precisely the expected correction of -1. this correction of -1 is
entirely due to the quantum treatment of the doubleton multiplet that is gauged away.
this is very satisfactory since the doubleton is known to be dual to the decoupled u(1)
factor of the sym theory which is su(n) rather than u(n). given that this already
provide the desired shift n 2  n 2  1, we expect that there is no contribution from
other string states at all. we also note that a consistent truncation to the states of the 5

2

dimensional supergravity multiplet alone is not sucient.

we will rst review in sec. 2 the arguments [2, 5] for matching the chiral anomaly with the
chern-simons term in the ve dimensional sugra action to leading order in n. then
in sec. 3 we determine the one loop corrections to the coecient of the chern-simons
action from the kaluza-klein towers. we nally discuss why it is plausible that other
string states dont modify the chern-simons coecient.

2 chiral anomalies in the n = 4 sym
the n = 4 sym in 4 dimensions has a r-symmetry group of su(4)r. the matter
elds are in nontrivial representation of it, with the scalars x i transforming in the 6 and
the four complex weyl fermions  in the fundamental representation of su(4)r with the
chirality part (0,1/2) in 4 and (1/2,0) in 4 (see for example [11]. our convention here
together with the convention we adopt in (17) are equivalent to those these authors used.)
it is convenient to use the compact notation of dierential forms [12, 13]. the correctly
normalized anomaly is derived from the descent equation

in+2

(2)n(n + 1)!

t rf n+1 = d2n+1(a),

v2n+1 = d1

2n(v, a),

where

f = da + a2,

va = dv + [a, v]

(1)

(2)

and v = vat a, a = aat a. va are commuting gauge parameters and t as are anti-
hermitian and are in the fundamental representation. explicitly for n = 2,

in this notation, the r-symmetry anomaly is

v  (dij i) = (n 2  1) zs 4

where we used the convention for einstein summation:

v  f = z d4x va(x)f a(x)

(6)

for any va(x) and f a(x). the n 2  1 factor is due to the fact that  is in the adjoint of
su(n).

for t a in a general representation r of the group, the corresponding quantities with the
trace taken in r are

r

2n

= a(r)1

2n,

r

2n+1 = a(r)2n+1,

(7)

where a(r) is the anomaly coecient dened by the ratio of the d-symbol taken in the
representation r and the fundamental representation. in general 2n or 2n+1 dimensions,
since the d-symbol is given by a symmetrized trace of n + 1 lie algebra generators, it is
easy to show that the complex conjugate representation r has an anomaly coecient

a(r) = (1)n+1a(r).

(8)

according to the ads/cft proposal, one should be able to see this anomaly from the
dual point of view of string theory. to leading order in n, one looks at the iib sugra
compactied on ads5 s 5 . the tree level sugra action contains the term [14, 15, 3, 5]

scl[a] =

5.

(9)

we note that in terms of components, k r 5 = ik
 +   , if
one uses hermitian generators and the denition of d-symbol in [5]. from the dual gauge
theory point of view, since the current j a is coupled to the su(4) gauge elds of the
bulk, using the ads/cft proposal one can determine the coecient g2
sg and k from the
2-point and 3-point correlators of j a [5] of the gauge theory. the normalization to leading
order in n

g2
sg =

n 2 ,

k = n 2,

(10)

has been determined in [5]. the ratio of the coecient g2
sg and k also agrees with what
one gets from supersymmetry [14, 15]. one may also determine the values of g2
sg and
k from a dimensional reduction of the 10 dimensional iib sugra. this requires the
knowledge of the n dependence of r. according to the proposal [1, 2, 3], the radius r of
s 5 is determined by r4/2 = g2
s n. using this, it is easy to determine the normalization
of the gauge kinetic energy term and one indeed nds g2
sg = 162/n 2 and hence k = n 2
using susy.

in usual consideration of sugra on ads, one considers gauge congurations aa which
vanish at the boundary and so the chern-simons term is gauge invariant. for the con-
sideration of ads/cft correspondence, the boundary value of the aa is nonvanishing
and coupled to the r-currents j a. under a gauge variation va, the variation of the
chern-simons term is a boundary term

vscl = k zs 4

(11)

now by the conjecture [1, 2, 3],

scl[aa

(x, x5)] = [aa

i (x)],

(12)

where  is the generating functional for current correlators in the boundary theory, and
hence

from this and (11), one can read o the anomaly. it is

vscl = v = v  (dij i).

v  (dij i) = n 2 zs 4

4(v, a),

which agrees with the gauge theory computation (5) to leading order in n.

(14)

3 induced chern-simons

as we have seen in the previous section, the iib tree level sugra contains a chern-
simons term which can account for the chiral anomaly of the gauge theory to leading order
in n. but there is also a mismatch of -1 which is of order 1/n 2. in this section, we will
examine the 1/n corrections to the chern-simons action on the string theory side. from
the point of view of the iib string theory, an expansion in 1/n is a quantum expansion
beyond tree level. in particular the 1/n 2 correction to the chiral anomaly corresponds to
a 1-loop computation in iib string theory. we will rst examine the corrections coming
from the kaluza-klein states. based on the origin of the chern-simons action in ads5
supergravity, we will argue in the discussion section that the other string states are not
likely to modify the chern-simons coecient.

fermionic contributions

it is well known that chiral fermions in even dimensions can give rise to an anomaly. al-
though there is no chirality in odd dimensions, there is a similar phenomenon for fermions
in odd dimensions. consider a dirac fermion  in odd dimensions (at) minimally coupled
to (external or gauge) vector bosons a of a group g. at the quantum level, a regulariza-
tion needs to be introduced to make sense of the theory and one cannot preserve both the
gauge symmetry (small and large) and the parity at the same time [16, 17]. if one chooses
to preserve the gauge symmetry by doing a pauli-villars regularization, then there will
be an induced chern-simons term generated at one loop. the result is independent of
the fermion mass [17, 18]. in our notation, the induced chern-simons term is

 = 

1

2 z r

2n+1 = 

1
2

a(r)z 2n+1,

(15)

where r is the representation of the dirac fermion. the  sign depends on the regular-
ization and can often be xed within a specic context.

5

this result was originally [16, 17] obtained for fermions coupled to gauge elds in a
at spacetime and has been extended to full generality for arbitrary curved backgrounds
and any odd dimensions [18]. the induced parity violating terms are given (up to a
normalization factor) by the secondary characteristic class q(a, ) satisfying

dq(a, ) = a(r)ch(f )|2n+2,

(16)

where  is the gravitational connection. going one step down the descent relation, one
gets the chiral anomaly of a dirac operator dened on a curved manifold. since a(r) =
1 + o(r2) and t rf = 0 for su, in ve dimensions there is only the gauge chern-simons
and the gravitational chern-simons terms from (16) and there is no mixing term. it is
clear that the pure gauge chern-simons piece takes the same expression (15) as in the
at case. this can indeed be expected from the beginning as the gauge chern-simons
form is independent of the metric. it is also clear that there is no induced gravitational
chern-simons term as it would be related to a gravitational anomaly in four dimensions,
and gravitational anomalies exist only in 4k + 2 dimensions.
now we need the particle spectrum of the type iib string theory on ads5  s 5 . the
only explicitly known states are the kk states coming from the compactication of the
10 dimensional iib sugra multiplet [10]. so we will examine them rst. particles in
ads5 are classied by their unitary irreducible representation of so(2, 4). since so(2, 4)
has the maximal compact subgroup so(2)  su(2)  su(2), irreducible representations
are labelled by the quantum numbers (e0, j1, j2). the complete kk spectrum of the iib
sugra on ads5  s 5 was obtained in [10] together with information on the masses (in
units of 1/r) 1 and the representation content under su(4)r. we reproduce these results
in the following table where we also give the su(2) su(2) content [19] for the fermionic
towers.

the fermions in this table are symplectic majorana spinors. for simplicity, we have only
listed half of the eld content. the other half (mirror) consists of elds with conjugate
su(4)r content and with the su(2)  su(2) quantum numbers exchanged [19]. the

rst member of the rows marked with an  together form the fermionic sector of the
n = 8 supergravity multiplet: 8 gravitini and 48 spin 1/2. we have chosen to list the
left handed spinors here. the chirality refers to the anti-de sitter group su(2, 2).
since the chern-simons term in odd dimensions is related to the chiral anomaly in one
lower dimension [18], the chirality thus allows us to x the  sign of the induced
chern-simons term. in particular, the right-handed (left-handed) spinor generates
a chern-simons term with + (-) sign in (15). we should also remember (8) that the
conjugate representation r has an opposite anomaly coecient in ve dimensions. to
determine the net induced chern-simons terms from all these states, we should also sum
over the mirror. notice that the right-handed sector contributes exactly the same as
the left-handed sector because relative to the left sector, they get one minus sign from
the chirality and another one from a(r). notice also that the induced chern-simons
term from a symplectic majorana spinor is half that of a dirac spinor because it contains
half as many degrees of freedom. therefore eectively we can just sum over the spectrum
in the left handed sector above using the formula

 =

(18)

as if they are dirac spinors.

it is clear that the towers of , ,  do not generate a net induced chern-simons term
as the states in these towers all comes in pairs with their su(4) content conjugate of each
other. however, as pointed out in [10], there is a missing k = 0 state (4) in the rst
tower of . there are similar missing states in the bosonic towers. together they are
identied with the doubleton multiplet of su(2, 2|4) which consists of a gauge potential,
six scalars and four complex spinors. these are nonpropagating modes in the bulk of
ads5 and can be gauged away completely [10, 20], which is the reason why they dont
appear in the physical spectrum. these modes are exactly dual to the u(1) factor of
the u(n) sym living on the boundary [4]. since from the sym point of view, the -1
correction to the chiral anomaly is due the decoupling of this u(1) to give su(n), we
expect that from the dual point of view of the ads5 string theory, the -1 correction would
also nd an explanation entirely in terms of these gauge modes. indeed, since there is an
additional k = 0 state (left-handed and in 4) in the tower of  which is not balanced
out, there will be a chern-simons term of -1/2 (in units of r 5) coming from this state.
this is only half of the desired result. however this is not the complete story.

let us recall the doubleton multiplet is absent because it has been gauged away [10]
by imposing the gravitino gauge xing condition (see also [20] for the gauging in the
case of ads7  s 4 case). hence to properly quantize the system, one has to introduce
the corresponding faddeev-popov ghosts. these ghosts will give another contribution of
1/2 to the chern-simons coecient. indeed the ghost multiplet contains bosonic spinors
in exactly the same su(4)r representation as the spinors of the doubleton multiplet, i.e.
in 4. natively one would expect a contribution opposite to the one of the unbalanced

7

k = 0 state (in 4) of the  tower. however, since the ghosts have opposite statistics,
they actually give the same contribution, i.e. another -1/2. so altogether we get a total
induced chern-simons term of -1,

 = zads5

5,

(19)

which is exactly the desired result. notice that the induced chern-simons (coming with
a constant integer coecient) is independent of the radius r and this is consistent with
the ads/cft proposal since the anomaly and its corrections are independent of .

bosonic contributions

there is another interesting eect related to the chern-simons action. it is known that in
three dimensions, the gluons at one loop can modify the coecient of the chern-simons
action by an integer shift. however, the precise modication depends on the regularization
scheme adopted 2. in ve dimensions, it is easy to convince oneself that there is no induced
chern-simons lagrangian coming from the gluon loops. the reason is simple. suppose
one adopt some regularization scheme to compute the gluon loops that may generate an
induced chern-simons term. since the gluons are in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group, the diagrams are proportional to the d-symbol of the adjoint representation,
or a(adj). for three dimensions, this is proportional to the quadratic casimir, but it is
zero in ve dimensions. in general, (8) says that a(r) = a(r) for 4k + 3 dimensions and
a(r) = a(r) for 4k + 1 dimensions. hence a(adj) = 0 for the present case. that the
gauge bosons do not modify the chern-simons coecient was already noted by witten
[2]. moreover, since the other members (64, 175,  ) of the spin 1 towers [10] are all in
real representations, they also dont modify the chern-simons action.

we thus see that while gauge boson loops do not modify the magnitude of the chern-
simons action, the spinor loops do. due to the intimate relation with the chiral anomaly
[18], one expects that there is a nonrenormalization theorem (counterpart of the bardeen
nonrenormalization theorem for the chiral anomaly) that protects the chern-simons ac-
tion from further corrections beyond one loop.

combining the above, we nd that at nite n, the coecient k is shifted by

due to the quantum eects of the full set of kaluza-klein states.

4 discussion

we have seen that the nite n dependence of the su(4)r chiral anomaly is exactly
accounted for by the quantum eects of the full set of kk states. a consistent truncation

to the 5 dimensional supergravity states does not do the job and has no reason that it
should. in fact, the total induced chern-simons term has its contribution coming from
the k = 0 state of the  tower and from the ghost spinors to the doubleton multiplet,
both have nothing to do with the ve dimensional supergravity multiplet. thus the -1
shift at nite n of the chiral anomaly nd a direct explanation entirely in terms of the
quantum eects of the doubleton multiplet in ads5, which is known to be dual to the
decoupled u(1) factor of the gauge theory. the whole picture is consistent.

for the ads/cft proposal to work at nite n, the other string states shouldnt contribute
any further corrections to the chern-simons coecient. while we dont have a proof of
this statement, we would like to argue that this is plausible.

in [21] the kaluza-klein origin of the chern-simons action in gauged supergravity theory
was explored. in particular, it was shown that for the case of ads7  s 4 compactication
of the 11 dimensional sugra, the chern-simons term comes from the 11-dimensional
chern-simons coupling r c  g  g upon compactication. the origin of the chern-
simons term in ads5 s 5 sugra was also discussed and it is expected to arise similarly
from the compactication of the 10 dimensional iib sugra. however, there are some
technical subtleties, the major one being the lack of a covariant action of the iib sugra.
it would be very interesting to work it out explicitly, presumably the formalism of [22]
will be useful.

given that the chern-simons term has its origin in the 10 dimensional sugra multiplet,
it is natural to expect that the quantum corrections to the chern-simons action are also
conned to the states related to the kaluza-klein compactication and we conjecture that
this is indeed the case.

since the trace anomaly and the r-symmetry anomaly are in the same susy multiplet,
a similar nite n correction of -1 should also appear in the trace anomaly. we expect
that again the correction will have an explanation entirely in terms of the quantum eects
related to the doubleton multiplet. it would be interesting to verify this explicitly. this
will provide a cross check of our conjecture here.

loop eects in ads5 supergravity are denitely highly nontrivial to compute. in fact,
tree level calculations already call for the invention of many ingenuous techniques and
methods. were it not for the topological character of the chern-simons action, one will
not be able to determine exactly the parity violating term induced at one loop. for
other processes involving loops, in addition to the diculty of evaluating complicated
momentum integrals, one also has a lot more states propagating since a truncation of
states to the 5 dimensional supergravity multiplet is not enough. it would be interesting
to nd other quantities that can be calculated at one or more loops in order to provide
other tests of the ads/cft proposal at nite n.

since chern-simons action exists generally in gauged supergravity on adsp+1 space, they
all have interpretation as chiral anomaly in the dual cft. for example, in the ads7  s 4

9

case discussed in [21], the chern-simons action has a coecient of n 3 and the 1/n 2
correction would be of order n. we suspect that this correction would again nd an
explanation in terms of the doubleton multiplet, which now consists of a tensor gauge
eld, four spinors and ve scalars.
