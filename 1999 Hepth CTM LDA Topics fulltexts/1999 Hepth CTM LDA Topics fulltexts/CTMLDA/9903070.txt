(9) (10) convenience x zero mode x0, 0 = 0. eigenvalues eigenfunctions uctuation operator numerically calculated diagonalization method matrix mainly composed fourier coe- cients v (p). several eigenvalues lowest one plotted fig. 2 three dierent types decay-rate transition. clear zero mode( p( )) originated time translational symmetry always exists bifurcation points another zero mode occurs, relevant symmetry system, symmetry vicinity periodic instanton bifurcation point. periodic instantons range d2s 2 > 0 two negative modes, means along directions negative modes function space periodic instanton gives maximun action value. next section explore mechanism change negative modes considering classical solutions function space. iii. analysis negative modes function space double well potential like eq.(2) action lower bound function space xed period . since periodic instanton one two negative modes, minimum function space saddle point one two negative mode directions along action value decreases approaching saddle point minimum. fortunately quantum mechanical model one nd possible saddle points minima given period solutions euler-lagrange equation. therefore, possible expect solution one meet ultimately one follows particular negative mode direction. 5 number negative modes around spaleron depends period . fact easily shown follows. curvature barrier top relation v (s) = 2/s, (11) period periodic instanton meets sphaleron. eigenvalue equation uctuation ( d2 2 ( 2 )2)n( ) = nn( ) n( ) = cos( 2n ), sin( 2n ) n = ( 2n )2 ( 2 )2, (n = 0, 1, 2, ). (12) (13) (14) except n = 0 case, states two-fold degenerated. number negative modes increases ; example, 0 < < s, one negative mode, < < 2s three negative modes on. increase negative modes shown natural followings. let us consider sphaleron solution period 1 < shown fig.1 (c). note period non-trivial solution. two trivial stable solutions + staying well minima, respectively(see fig.1 (a)). sphaleron one negative mode innite number positive modes two-fold degenerated. fig.3 solutions period 1 several lowest eigenfunctions described. clear sphaleron solution go + adding subtracting negative eigenfunction x1. so, situation described graphically function space fig.4. certain one classical solution ow along negative mode directions solutions lower action vicinity those. now, consider periodic instanton p period 2 > fig.1(c). fig.5 shows possible solutions period 2 several eigenfuctions uctuation operator periodic instantion. periodic instanton one negative mode(x1), one zero mode(x0), 6 innite number positive modes(xn, n = 1, 2, 3, ). since sphaleron solution ows along negative mode direction(x1) + , periodic instanton reach exactly + along negative mode direction, go vicinity stable trivial solutions. zero mode periodic instanton shifted without variation action value, time translational symmetry. lowest positive mode x1 connects p sphaleron solution 2/2shifted periodic instanton p. combining facts one summarize situation fig.6. gure clear sphaleron period 2 three negative modes; one x1 connects + like fig.4 (a) others x0 x1 connect 2/4shifted periodic instanton p p, respectively. sphaleron period 2s < < 3s negative modes. explained considering solution composed two periodic instanton period /2 shown fig.7. thus, additional two negative mode x2 x3 direction periodic instanton half period, p,/2 /4shifted half periodic instanton p,/2 shown fig.7. case rst-order transition periodic instanton two negative modes. let us consider periodic instanton p,u period 3 (see fig.1 (f)) two negative modes x1 x1, one zero mode x0, innite number positive modes. fig.8 (a) possible solutions = drawn. non-trivial solutions connected along x1 direction, shown fig.8 (b). gure shows p,u negative eigenvalue p,d positive eigenvalue x1 direction. 3 decreases, p,u p,d approach other, bifurcation point action value disppear. 3 increases s, p,u merging creating maximum s. finally, consider case unusual second-order transition. possible solutions period 4(see fig.1 (i)) positions along x1 direction function space described fig.9. case p,u p,d merge bifurcation point c1 p,m p,u bifurcation point c2, negative eigenvalues x0 x1 directions well x1 direction. 7 analysis conclude additional negative modes require existence solutions lower action value, equivalent situation occurrence new maximum always accompanies new minima. iv. criterion first-order transition section derive criterion rst-order transition fact rst-order transition periodic instantion near sphaleron two negative modes second-order case one negative mode. fact applied eld theoretical well quantum mechanical models. paper concentrate scalar eld theories. however, extensions kinds eld theories non-linear o(3) model  without  skyrme term straightforward, addressed separate publication. start euclidean action scalar eld s = z 0 z d~x . (15) consider small uctuation (~x, ) periodic instantion p(~x, ), action s = s + 1 2 z 0 z d~x (~x, ) (~x, ), = 2 2 2 + v (p). (16) (17) since periodic instanton near sphaleron expressed  p(~x, ) = s(~x) + ag0(~x) cos + a2(g1(~x) + g2(~x) cos 2 ), (18) small amplitude g0(~x),g1(~x), g2(~x) determined shortly, eigenvalue equation becomes upto order a2 (l + h + h )(~x, ) = (~x, ), (19) 8 l = 2 2 , h = 2 + v (s), (20) h = av (s)g0(~x) cos + a2. treat operator (l + h) unperturbed part. eigenspectrum l l(| sin n >, | cos n >) = (n)2(| sin n >, | cos n >). (21) let us assume eigenspectrum h h|un(~x) >= n|un(~x) >, (n = 0, 1, 2, ). (22) h operator one negative mode |u0(~x) >. fact p p/xi zero modes due time space translational symmetry, one determine 2 = 0 g0(~x) = u0(~x), g1(~x) = g2(~x) = 1 4 1 4 h1u2 0(~x)v (s), (h + 42)1u2 0(~x)v (s). (23) zero modes unperturbed part uctuation operator sphaleron |u0 sin >, |u0 cos >, |um >, (m = 1, 2, d). perturbation h turns on, second zero mode |u0 cos > shifted zero zero modes aected perturbation zero modes relavant systems symmetries, i.e., time space translational symmetries. therefore, using standard perturbation theory, determine number negative modes vicinity sphaleron. let 0 1 perturbed eigenvalues |u0 sin > |u0 cos >, respectively. then, 1 0 < 0 number negative 9 mode becomes two, transition rst order. criterion rst-order transition is, then, straightforwardly derived < u0|g2v + 1 4 v g2 0|u0 > 1 2 < u0|g0v h1g0v |u0 > < 0.
