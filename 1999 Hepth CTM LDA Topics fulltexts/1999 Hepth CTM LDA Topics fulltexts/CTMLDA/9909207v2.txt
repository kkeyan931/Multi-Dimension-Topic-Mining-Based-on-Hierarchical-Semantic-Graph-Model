regularization of qed by a generalized t hooft and veltman

method

abstract

generalizing the t hooft and veltman method of unitary regulators, we

demonstrate for the rst time the existence of local, lorentz-invariant, phys-

ically motivated lagrangians of quantum-electrodynamic phenomena such

that: (i) feynman diagrams are nite and equal the diagrams of qed but

with regularized propagators. (ii) n-point green functions are causal. (iii) s-

matrix relates only electrons, positrons and photons, is unitary and lorentz-

invariant, and conserves charge and total four-momentum.

i. introduction

perturbative predictions about quantum-electrodynamic phenomena implied by a qed

lagrangian can be computed using the feynman rules, a regularization method to circum-

vent ultraviolet divergencies, and a renormalization scheme. regularization method results

in regularized n-point green functions; a suitable limiting procedure (a renormalization

scheme) then leads to physically sensible predictions that are independent of the particu-

lar regularization method used. but no known regularized n-point green functions can be

regarded as being based on a physically plausible theory of quantum-electrodynamic phe-

nomena since the derivation of each disregards some of the basic tenets of conventional

physics (e.g., by lacking a lagrangian, by not being lorentz-invariant, by introducing par-

ticles with wrong metric or statistics. . . ). so the perturbative predictions of qed presently

cannot be derived from a physically plausible theory; for a history of, and comments on this

basic problem see, e.g., [1]. dirac [2] believed that removal of this conceptual inconsistency

may lead to an important advance in eld theories.

to show that one can remove this inconsistency already in four-dimensional space-time,

we will introduce a new, physically motivated modication of the qed lagrangian and con-

sider it within the theoretical framework of t hooft and veltman [3]: they avoid canonical

formalism and take diagrams as the basis from which everything must be derived; so they

give a perturbative denition of the s-matrix directly in terms of diagrams corresponding

to a given lagrangian as specied by postulated feynman rules. the question is: how do

we modify the qed lagrangian so that the resulting regularized s-matrix is derived from a

theory that is physically plausible?

gupta [4] has shown already in 1952 that one can modify the qed lagrangian so that the

new lagrangian results in the s-matrix of qed regularized by certain pauli-villars method.

and twenty years later t hooft and veltman [3] introduced the method of unitary regulators

(hv-method) that (i) is a variant of pauli-villars methods for regularizing propagators,

(ii) requires only an exceedingly simple modication of the initial lagrangian, and (iii) is

very suitable for proving the causality of the regularized n-point green functions and the

unitarity of the resulting s-matrix. unfortunately both methods introduce also unphysical

particles with wrong metric or statistics. to get rid of this serious conceptual deciency, we

will generalize the hv-method.

we will demonstrate the utility of the generalized hv-method by using it to show that

there is a perturbative s-matrix of quantum-electrodynamic phenomena derived from a

theory that is physically plausible (a pp-theory, for short) in the following sense:

(i) a pp-theory of quantum-electrodynamic phenomena is specied in a continuous, four-

2

dimensional space-time by a local, lorentz-invariant, physically motivated modica-

tion of a qed lagrangian.

(ii) the feynman rules for this modied lagrangian, dened as specied by t hooft and

veltman [3], result in feynman diagrams that are nite and equal the diagrams of

qed but with regularized propagators.

(iii) all constants of a pp-theory are measurable in principle; there are no auxiliary param-

eters.

(iv) for certain values of these constants, the qed propagators are the same kind of

low-energy approximations to their regularizations as required for renormalization by

bogoliubov and shirkov [5] in certain variants of the pauli-villars method.

(v) the n-point green functions of a pp-theory, dened as specied by t hooft and velt-

man [3] in terms of feynman diagrams, are causal.

(vi) the perturbative s-matrix of a pp-theory, dened as specied by t hooft and veltman

[3] in terms of n-point green functions, is unitary, lorentz-invariant, charge and total

four-momentum conserving, and relates only physical electrons, positrons and photons.

such a pp-theory of quantum-electrodynamic phenomena is not yet known; we cannot in-

corporate a nite-cuto, pauli-villars, dimensional, or lattice regularization of qed in a

pp-theory.

ii. lorentz-invariant regulators without singularities

as in the hv-method to each additional singularity of a regularized feynman propagator

corresponds an additional particle [3], we will rst show how we can lorentz-invariantly

regularize feynman propagators so that they do not acquire additional singularities and have

the kallen-lehman representation used in proving causality and unitarity [3,6]. regarding

3

metric and other conventions we follow refs. [3,6]; in particular, a four-vector k = (~k, ik0),
and k2  ~k  ~k  (k0)2.

consider a lorentz-invariantly regularized spin 0 feynman propagator, say, f (x) whose

space-time fourier transform

(2)4igf (k) = (k2 + m2  i)1 + (k2  i)

(1)

where: (a) the regulator (z) is an analytic function of complex variable z with a nite
discontinuity somewhere across the negative real axis; (b) |(z + m2)1 + (z)| < a|z|r for
|z| > 2m2, with r > 1; (c) (z) is real if z > 0 and z = 0; (d) (z) depends on some
constant  so that for any   0 > 0 it has properties (a) to (c) with a independent of ,
and, as   ,

sup

z0,z=0|(z)|  0 and

sup
|z|<z0 |(z)|  0

for any z0 > 0 .

(2)

as a consequence, the spin 0 propagator provides such a low-energy approximation to its

regularization (1) as required for renormalization by bogoliubov and shirkov [5] in certain

variants of the pauli-villars method.

using cauchys integral formula we can conclude that the lorentz-invariant regulariza-

tion (1) of the spin 0 feynman propagator admits the kallen-lehman representation

(2)4igf (k) = z 

0

(s)

k2 + s  i

ds

with

(s) = (s  m2) + (2i)1 lim

y0

[(s  iy)  (s + iy)] ,

s, y > 0. note that (s) is real, (s) = o(sr) as s  , and

z 

0

sm(s) ds = 0

for m = 0, 1, . . . < r  1 .

(3)

(4)

(5)

so we can decompose the regularized spin 0 propagator f (x) into positive and negative
energy parts: f (x) = (x0)+(x) + (x0)(x) [3].

4

the function i(2)4(2  m2 + )n(k2 + m2  i)1(k2 + 2  i + )n,  > m,

n = 1, 2, . . ., is an example of a lorentz-invariantly regularized spin 0 feynman propagator

that satises the above conditions with r = n/2 + 1. unfortunately, we cannot use such

propagators for a physically plausible regularization of qed since we do not know how to

construct the corresponding local, lorentz-invariant lagrangians.

a regulator that satises conditions (a)-(c) is by (3) a generalization of the pauli-villars

regulator that has a continuous mass spectrum. thus, to use such regulators to construct

a pp-theory, we have to extend the t hooft-veltman construction of lagrangians in hv-

method [3] to an innite number of additional elds. to provide an example of how this

can be done, we will present a local, lorentz-invariant lagrangian whose propagators for

interacting elds can be taken as spin 1 and spin 1

2 propagators regularized so that they

acquire no additional singularities and have the kallen-lehman representation.

iii. lagrangian that regularizes qed propagators

following veltman [6], we will consider qed with massive photons in unitary gauge. its

lagrangian reads
lqed =  1

4(a  a)2  1

22a2  (

  + m) + ie a + aj + je + je ,

(6)

where j(x), je(x), and je(x) are four-vector and bispinor source elds, and the non-
vanishing photon mass  < 2  1016 ev [7]. the feynman propagators for the four-vector
eld a(x) and for the bispinor eld (x) are:

 i(2)4  + 2kk
k2 + 2  i

,

i(2)4 ik + m
k2 + m2  i

.

(7)

we could use lqed to dene a pp-theory as specied in section i, were the propagators (7)
faster decreasing when k2 tends to innity.

however, one can modify the qed lagrangian (6) so that the propagators for the elds

a and  are such regularizations of propagators (7) that have no additional singularities.

5

take, for example, the following real-valued, local, lorentz-invariant lagrangian:

ltr = l1  l1/2 + ie a + aj + je + je

(8a)

with

1 z d4p 

l1  q1

(x,p)[t(p2) + p 

](x, p)

1 s1z d4p d4p f (p2)f (p2)[

1/2z d4p 1/2(x,p)[t(p2) + p

l1/2  q1

 ]1/2(x, p)

1/2s1/2z d4p d4p f (p2)f (p2)[ 1/2(x,p)1/2(x, p)p + c.c.] ,

(x,p)(x, p) + p

p(x,p)(x, p)

(8b)

(8c)

(8d)

 q1
a(x)  z d4pf (p2)(x, p) ,

(x)  z d4pf (p2)1/2(x, p) ,

where: (x, p) and 

(x, p) are four-vector-valued functions of two four-vectors x and p;

1/2(x, p) is a bispinor-valued function of x and p; 2a



 b  a(b)  (a)b; 1/2  

1/24;

t(p2) and f (p2) are real-valued functions of real p2, r d4pf 2(p2) = 1; q1, s1, q1/2, s1/2, and 

are real constants.

there are three kinds of reasons for the chosen form (8) of the lagrangian ltr:

(a) it is our purpose to show that there are lagrangians that generalize the thooft and

veltman method of unitary regulators [3] to an innite number of additional elds but

do not introduce additional particles. so we constructed the lagrangian ltr modify-
ing lqed on the analogy of hv-method [3]: (i) we introduced an innite number of
four-vector and bispinor elds of x that have a continuous index p, namely (x, p),


(x, p), and 1/2(x, p). (ii) we replaced the free part of lqed with the free lagrangian
of these elds, l1  l1/2, which is of the rst order in  and has a nondiagonal mass
matrix. (iii) in the interaction and source terms of lqed, we replaced the elds a(x)
and (x) with weighted integrals (8d) of (x, p) and 1/2(x, p) over the continuous

index p.

6

(b) we tried to simplify the calculations of regularized propagators. we could do without

the four-vector function 
same functions t(p2) and f (p2) in l1 and l1/2. we introduced
real-valued, not only its action real as required.

(x, p) which we introduced solely to be able to use the
 to make ltr itself



(c) the euler-lagrange equations of ltr resemble the boltzmann integro-dierential
transport equation, which can better model rapidly varying, ultra-high-energy,

macroscopic uid phenomena than the dierential equations of motion of uid dy-

namics.

(to this end it uses an innite number of elds to take some account of

the underlying microscopic behaviour.) euler-lagrange equations of ltr may be re-
garded as classical transport equations of motion for the one-particle distribution of

some innitesimal entities, such as x-ons surmised to underly all physical phenomena

by feynman [8]. which all are physical motivations for the type of lagrangian we

constructed; we discuss them in detail in ref. [9].

using the euler-lagrange equations of ltr and proceeding as in ref. [10], we calculate
(x, p) on j(x), and of 1/2(x, p) on je(x). thereby we

the dependence of (x, p) and 

can infer that the feynman propagator for the four-vector eld a(x) dened by (8d) equals

if functions t(p2) and f (p2) are such that

z 

0

f 2(y)t(y) |y/t(y)|l+1dy = 0

(14)

for l = 0,1, . . . ,n, then for complex values of k as |k2|  :

when the function y/t2(y) takes only a nite number of real values vi, i = 1, 2, . . ., we

can explicitly evalute integrals (11); we obtain

imn(k2) = mxi

amnivm

i [q1 + 2vik2 + 1]m ,

(16)

where amni are real constants. considering such a case, we can show that for any 2, m2 and

integer n, there exist functions f (p2) and t(p2), and constants s1, s1/2, q1, q1/2, and 0 > 0

such that the propagators (9) and (12) with  > 0 are regularizations of spin 1 and spin

1
2 propagators (7) such that: (i) they have properties analogous to those of propagator (1),
0 the functions imn(k2),
and (ii) there is a positive constant k2

0 such that for all k2  2k2

eg1/2(k2), e(k2), eg1(k2), and fm(k2) are real. in such a case: (i) the constants s1, s1/2, q1, and

q1/2 are such that

e2(2) = 2 ,
eg1/2(2) = 1 + de2(k2 = 2)/dk2 ,

fm2(m2) = m2 ,
eg1(m2) = 1 + dfm2(k2 = m2)/dk2 .

(17)

(18)

so the propagators (9) and (12) have poles at k2 = 2 and k2 = m2, where their
behaviour is given by the spin 1 and spin 1
2 propagators (7) with  = 0. (ii) the dierence

between spin 1 propagator and propagator (9) depends on the value of  so that it satises

relations analogous to (2); and the same goes for spin 1

2 propagators. (iii) the propagators
(9) and (12) are analytic functions of k2 that (a) are not continuous everywhere across

the negative real axis, (b) have no additional singularities to those of spin 1 and spin 1
2

8

propagators (7), and (c) satisfy relations (15). for any integer n  3, their kallen-lehman
in x-space we can decompose the feynman
integral representations are superconvergent:

propagators (9) and (12) into positive and negative energy parts without contact terms [3].

iv. physically plausible regularization of qed

to obtain a perturbative s-matrix of quantum-electrodynamic phenomena based on the

lagrangian ltr, say str, we use the t hooft-veltman denition of an s-matrix [3]. in view
of results of sec.iii, there are functions f (p2) and t(p2), and constants s1, s1/2, q1, q1/2, and

 such that the n-point green functions of ltr and the corresponding s-matrix str have
the following properties:

(i) as the lagrangian ltr has the same interaction and source terms as the qed la-
grangian lqed, they are expressed in terms of qed diagrams with the spin 1 and spin
1
2 propagators (7) replaced with their regularizations (9) and (12), whereas the vertices
are the same as in qed, i.e., (2)4; so all diagrams are nite.

(ii) as the propagators (9) and (12), and higher-order 2-point green functions of ltr have
no additional singularities, str relates the same particles as the s-matrix of qed with

massive photons in unitary gauge: electrons and positrons, each with two possible

polarization vectors, and massive photons with three possible polarization vectors;

none of them with wrong metric or statistics.

(iii) n-point green functions are causal and str is unitary to any order in the ne structure

constant. to show this we may follow the t hooft-veltman proof for the hv-method

[3], since the propagators (9) and (12) admit the kallen-lehman representation.

(iv) str is charge and total four-momentum conserving since its vertices are such.

(v) str is lorentz-invariant, since the propagators (9) and (12) commute with lorentz

transformations and the vertices are lorentz-invariant.

9

(vi) in the asymptote   , the propagators (9) and (12) behave the same way as
required by bogoliubov and shirkov [5] of the pauli-villarsregularized spin 1 and

spin 1

2 propagators when their auxiliary masses tend to innity in renormalization.

so, str is a result of a pp-theory as dened in section i. this theory can be regarded as

a physically plausible regularization of qed based on a physically motivated modication

ltr of qed lagrangian lqed.

in view of (vi), we expect that we can compute by renormalization the renormalized

n-point green functions of qed with massless photons from the n-point green functions of

ltr by choosing an appropriate dependence of e, s1, s1/2, q1, and q1/2 on , and then limiting
   and the renormalized photon mass to zero. however, it is an open question whether
the functions f (p2) and t(p2) must have also some additional properties for the photon third

polarization vector to decouple in the limit of negligible photon mass [6].

v. comments

generalizing the t hooft and veltman method of unitary regulators we have shown, for

the rst time as far as we know, that one can regularize qed in accordance with the basic

tenets of theoretical physics by suitably modifying the free part of qed lagrangian. as we

mentioned in sec.iii, the physical motivation for such modication has been the feynman

surmise about x-ons, and the boltzmann improvement on uid dynamics by the transport

theory based on his equation.

within the framework of quantum eld theory as dened by t hooft and veltman [3],

the lagrangian ltr is related to the physical world solely through the perturbatively dened
scattering matrix str. we see no physical properties of str that require the spectral function

(4) and the hamiltonians corresponding to free lagrangians l1 and l1/2 (which are not free-
particle lagrangians) to be positive as they turn out to be within the framework of canonical

formalism [1].

the need for a regularization of qed that would result in a physically plausible model

10

was felt very strongly by the founders of qed, dirac and heisenberg, already some sixty-

ve years ago [1]. but neither they nor their contemporaries succeded in getting rid of

the ultraviolet divergencies by a physicaly motivated modication of the qed lagrangian.

in the late 1940s, however, tomonaga, schwinger and feynman solved the problem of

qed ultraviolet divergencies through renormalizationa solution which does not require

regularization to be physically plausible, and removes all parameters characteristic of regu-

larization. as they obtained spectacularly succesful formulas for quantum-electrodynamic

phenomena, the problem of nding a physically plausible, lagrangian-based regularization

of qed was not so urgent any more. as there had been no progress whatsoever towards a

solution of this problem, it mainly came to be considered as practically unsolvable [1]; those

who hoped otherwise were often considered irrational, as isham, salam, and strathdee

[11] complained twenty-ve years later. thus nowadays, as far as we know, no quantum-eld

theorist, excepting the string theorist, pays much attention to this problem, which many of

the preceding generationse.g., dirac, heisenberg, landau, pauli, and salam, to mention

somestill hoped to be solved somehow someday [1]. but the string theorists abandon one

of the basic premises of conventional physics, the four-dimensionality of space-time. we

have shown, however, that such drastic steps may be avoided when modifying qed la-

grangian to get rid of ultraviolet divergencies. but the question remains which modication

of the type considered is the most appropriate for better describing quantum-electrodynamic

phenomena at higher energies than the conventional qed, and what is its content.
