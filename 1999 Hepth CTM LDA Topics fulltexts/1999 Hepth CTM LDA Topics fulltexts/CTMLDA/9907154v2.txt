boulatov and ooguri have generalized the matrix models of 2d quantum gravity to 3d and 4d,
in the form of eld theories over group manifolds. we show that the barrett-crane quantum
gravity model arises naturally from a theory of this type, but restricted to the homogeneous space
s 3 = so(4)/so(3), as a term in its feynman expansion. from such a perspective, 4d quantum
spacetime emerges as a feynman graph, in the manner of the 2d matrix models. this formalism
provides a precise meaning to the sum over triangulations, which is presumably necessary for a
physical interpretation of a spin foam model as a theory of gravity. in addition, this formalism leads
us to introduce a natural alternative model, which might have relevance for quantum gravity.

i. introduction

the barrett-crane relativistic model [1] is an intriguing proposal for addressing the problem of constructing a
quantum theory of gravity. the model is related to the covariant, or spin-foam, formulation [2] of loop quantum
gravity [3], and has recently received much attention. barrett and crane have dened this model as a state sum
dened over a xed triangulation  of 4d spacetime. here, we show that the q  1 limit of the barrett-crane
model can be derived from the feynman expansion of a eld theory over four copies of the homogeneous space
s3 = so(4)/so(3).1 more precisely, the barrett-crane model is dened as a sum over colorings c (assignments of
spins to faces) of the triangulation 

where abc (, c) is the barrett-crane amplitude of the colored triangulation (, c). in the feynman expansion

zbc [] = xc

abc (, c),

z = z d es[] = x

v[]

(2)

of the eld theory we consider, the feynman graphs  turn out to have the structure of a 2-complex. here s[] is
the action, which depends on a coupling constant , while v[] and sym[] are the number of vertices and the order
of symmetries of . every triangulation  determines a 2-complex  = (): the 2-skeleton of its dual cellular
complex. we show in this paper that the barrett-crane model over the triangulation  is precisely the amplitude of
the feynman graph ():

more remarkably, the single terms of the sum (1) match. in fact, rst of all, the space over which our eld theory is
dened is compact and the feynman integrals are replaced by feynman sums

zbc[] = z[()].

(3)

1barrett and crane dene two versions of their model. we recover here their rst version.

z[] = xc

a(, c).

(4)

next, we show that the discrete momenta c in (4) correspond precisely to the colorings c of the triangulation in
(1). that is, they are spins attached to (the 2-cells of the 2-complex () which are dual to) the faces of . and,
nally, we show that the barrett-crane amplitude is precisely equal to the feynman amplitude of the corresponding
colored 2-complex (, c)

abc (, c) = a((), c).

(5)

the feynman expansion of eld theory we consider generates many more terms than a barrett-crane model over
a xed triangulation. the additional summation is precisely what we need in order to address the main diculty in
developing a physical theory of quantum gravity starting from the barrett-crane model (or from spin foam models in
general [4]). in these models, indeed, the choice of a xed triangulation breaks the full covariance of the theory and
unphysically restricts the number of the degrees of freedom. therefore some sort of sum over all triangulations is
needed on physical grounds. the diculty is to choose a precise characterization of the objects over which to sum,
and to x the relative weights. this is precisely done by the full feynman expansion of our eld theory. therefore,
the eld theory provides a precise implementation of the loose idea of summing over triangulations. in detail, one
rst notices that the barrett-crane amplitude abc (, c) does not depend on the full (combinatorial) information
contained in the triangulation , but only on a subset of this. in fact, it depends only on the 2-complex (), its
dual 2-skeleton. thus, the barrett-crane state sum (1) is actually a sum over all colorings of a xed 2-complex.
the expansion (2) extends the barrett-crane state sum (1) to a sum over colored 2-complexes, and xes the relative
weight of these. thus, what emerges in the feynman expansion is not a sum over actual triangulations, as one might
have naively expected, but rather a sum over certain dierent objects: colored 2-complexes s = (, c)

z = xs

a(s).

(6)

now, colored 2-complexes s are precisely spin foams. spin foams were derived (under the name branched colored
surfaces) in describing the dynamics of loop quantum gravity [2]. indeed, the covariant formulation of loop quantum
gravity yields a partition function which is precisely a sum over spin foams of the form (6). intuitively, a spin foam
describes the time evolution of the spin networks, the states of loop quantum gravity [5]. the idea that quantum
spacetime could be described in terms of objects of this kind has been proposed earlier, in particular by baez [6] and
reisenberger [7] (see also iwasaki [8]). in [4], baez has dened and analyzed the general notion of spin foam model
(and has introduced the term spin foam); we refer to baez papers [4] and [9] for an introduction and a discussion
of these models. see also [10,11].

the idea of obtaining a sum over triangulations from a feynman expansion was successfully implemented some
time ago, in the context of the matrix models of 2d dimensional quantum gravity, or zero dimensional string theory
[12]. in that context, one views a triangulated spacetime as a term in a feynman expansion of the matrix model.
here, we essentially show that the same strategy works in 4d: the terms in the barrett-crane state sum can be
loosely interpreted as a quantized spacetime geometry, and we show here that these spacetime geometries are
generated as feynman graphs, as in the 2d quantum gravity models. the convergence with the 2d matrix models is
not accidental, since matrix models are at the root of one of the lines of development that lead to the barrett-crane
theory. indeed, an extension of the matrix models to 3d was obtained by boulatov in [13]. boulatov showed that
the feynman expansion of a certain eld theory over three copies of su(2) generates triangulations, colorings and
amplitudes of the ponzano-regge formulation of 3d quantum gravity [14] (and, taking the q deformation of su (2), the
amplitudes of the turaev-viro model [15]). ooguri has extended the boulatov construction to 4d in [16]. the ooguri
theory is a eld theory over 4 copies of su(2). its feynman expansion determines a state sum for a triangulated 4d
spacetime, in which the sum is over the irreducible representations of su(2). replacing su(2) with the quantum group
su(2)q (q root of 1), yields a nite and well dened sum, the ooguri-crane-yetter model [17], which was shown by
crane, kauman and yetter [18] to be triangulation independent, and therefore to be an invariant of the 4-manifold.
the ooguri-crane-yetter invariant can be shown to be the partition function of bf theory [19]. as euclidean general
relativity can be seen as an so(4) bf theory with an added constraint, see e.g. [20], it was then natural to search
for a model of quantum euclidean general relativity as a modication of the so(4) ooguri-crane-yetter state sum
model. the constraint that reduces bf theory to general relativity has an appealing geometrical interpretation.
barrett and crane realized that this constraint can be implemented within an so(4) crane-yetter state sum model

2

by (appropriately) restricting the sum to simple representations only.2 (see also [21].) results in [11,22] support the
idea that the barrett-crane model is indeed related to quantum general relativity.

recently, it was pointed out that harmonic analysis on the homogeneous space s3 = so(4)/so(3) yields precisely
the simple representations of so(4) [23].
it was then tempting to conjecture that by suitably restricting the 4d
boulatov-ooguri eld theory to this homogeneous space one could get (the q  1 limit of) the barrett-crane model.
here we show that this is indeed the case, with an additional bonus: while for the ponzano-regge and for the ooguri-
crane-yetter models the eld theory generates a redundant sum over terms all equal to each other by triangulation
independence, in the barrett-crane case the additional summation cures the breaking of covariance introduced with
the choice of a triangulation, as we have discussed above. this, in a certain sense, closes a circle, bringing the recent
developments back to the original matrix model idea that spacetime can be viewed as a feynman graph of a quantum
theory. the interpretation vividly emphasizes the background independence of these formulations of quantum gravity.
finally, the formalism we develop, naturally suggest another model, dierent from barrett-crane one. indeed, in
the eld theory we consider, so(4) invariance can be imposed in two ways: by the left or the right action of so(4) on
so(4)/so(3). these turn out to be inequivalent. the second alternative (case b, below) yields the barrett-crane
model (rst version). the rst alternative (case a, below), is far more natural from the group theoretical point
of view. it yields a dierent model, somewhat closer to, but distinct from the second version of the barrett-crane
model. we argue in the conclusion that this other model has interesting properties. in particular, it represents another
solution to the problem of quantizing the constraints that transform bf theory into general relativity.

in section ii we dene our eld theory, and state our main results in detail.

in section iii we nd the mode
in section v we discuss
expansion of the eld. section iv studies the feynman expansion for the two theories.
the relation between the graphs generated by the feynman expansion and the triangulations. we also discuss some
further variants of the model, in which orientation is taken into account. in section vi we conclude with some general
comments. in the two appendices, we recall some elements of so(n ) representation theory.

ii. definition of the models and main result

we consider the group g = so(4) and we x an so(3) subgroup h of g. in particular, we may consider so(4)
in its fundamental representation and choose a vector v0 in the representation space; we then let h be the so(3)
subgroup which leaves v0 invariant. right multiplication by an element of h denes an equivalence relation in g:
g  g if there is h  h such that gh = g. the space of the equivalence classes, so(4)/so(3), is dieomorphic to the
3-sphere s3. we denote the elements of s3 as x. note that the invariant normalized measures dx, dh and dg on s3,
so(3) and so(4) respectively are related as dg = dx dh.

we consider a real eld (g1, g2, g3, g4) over the cartesian product of four copies of g = so(4). we take  square

integrable with respect to each argument. we require that  is constant along the equivalence classes.

(g1, g2, g3, g4) = (g1h1, g2h2, g3h3, g4h4),

( h1, h2, h3, h4  h);

(7)

so that  is in fact a function over the homogeneous space (s3)4, which we can write as (x1, x2, x3, x4). we will
employ both notations. we require  to be invariant under any permutation  of its four arguments

(g1, g2, g3, g4) = (g(1), g(2), g(3), g(4)).

(8)

(in section v, we will consider alternative symmetry requirements as well.) finally, we project  on its so(4)
invariant part. this can be done in two ways.

 case a. the natural action of so(4) on the right coset s3 = so(4)/so(3) is the left action of the group. thus
we dene

(g1, g2, g3, g4) = z dg (gg1, gg2, gg3, gg4).

(9)

2irreducible representations of so(4) are labeled by two half integers (two spins) (j , j) : j  + j  = integer. a representation
is simple if j  = j := j. thus, simple representations are labeled by just one spin j. here, following group-theory literature
conventions, we use the color n = 2j, instead of the spin j, for labeling the simple representation.

the potential (fth order) term has the structure of a 4-simplex. that is, if we represent each of the ve elds in
the product as a node with 4 legs one for each gi and connect pair of legs corresponding to the same argument, we
obtain (the one-skeleton of) a 4-simplex, see fig. 1. this completes the denition of our eld theory.

in the following sections, we show that the feynman expansion (2) of this eld theory is a sum over spin foams s as
in (6). a spin foam s = (, c) is here a colored combinatorial 2-dimensional cellular complex, or colored 2-complex.
a 2-complex  is formed by three abstract sets v,e,f , whose elements are respectively denoted vertices v, edges
e, and faces f , and boundary relations that assign two vertices to each edge, and a cycle of edges (a cyclic sequence
of edges in which any two consecutive edges are distinct and share a vertex) to each face. the number of edges that
a vertex bounds (adjacent to the vertex) is called the valence of the vertex, and the number of faces that an edge
bounds (adjacent to the edge) is called the valence of the edge. a coloring c = ({nf},{ie}) of the 2-complex  is an
assignment of an irreducible representations nf of some group g to each face f and of an intertwiner ie to each
edge e. an intertwiner ie is a vector in k ~ne
, the invariant subspace of the tensor product of the hilbert spaces of the
representations ~ne = (nf1 . . . nfn ) assigned to the faces f1...fn adjacent to the edge e. see the appendix for details
on k ~ne

, and [4,9] for details on these models in general.

a generic spin foam model is dened by a sum over spin foams:

w() z[]

z = x
z[] = x{nf },{ie} yf

af (nf ) ye

ae( ~ne, ie) yv

av( ~nv,~v).

(12)

(13)

the rst sum is over the 2-complexes and the second over the colorings. w() is a weight factor for each 2-complex.
we have indicated by ~ne the set of the colors of the faces adjacent to the edge e, and by ~nv and ~v the set of the
colors of the faces and the edges adjacent to the vertex v. the factors af , ae and av are called the amplitudes of
the faces, edges and vertices. since every edge connects exactly two vertices, one can always absorb the amplitude of
the edge ae( ~ne,~e) into the denition of the vertex amplitude av( ~nv,~v). this is not possible for the amplitude of
the face af (nf ), since faces can be shared by an arbitrary number of vertices.

in this paper, we consider only 2-complexes  with 4-valent edges and 5-valent vertices (for any other , we have
w() = 0). notice that the 2-skeleton of the cellular complex dual to a triangulation  of a 4-manifold is a 2-complex

4

of this kind. indeed, vertices are 5-valent because they are dual to 4-simplices, which are bounded by precisely ve
tetrahedra; and edges are 4-valent because they are dual to the tetrahedra, which are bounded by four triangles.

the feynman expansion of our eld theory yields a spin foam model. the 2-complex weight factor w() vanishes
unless  has 4-valent edges and 5-valent vertices only; in this case, it is given by w() = n()/sym(). here n() is
the number of vertices and sym() the order of the symmetries of the graph underlying the two-complex , dened
as in standard feynman graph theory, see for instance [24], page 93. the amplitudes are as follows.

 case a. we color faces of by simple representation nf of so(4), and edges by intertwiners ie, forming an
orthonormal basis in k ~ne
. the amplitude of the face is af = 1. the amplitude of the edge is ae = 1. the
vertex amplitude av( ~nv, ~v) is the 15-j wigner symbol a( ~nv, ~v) constructed from the ten simple representations
~nv and ve intertwiners iv. the amplitude of a 2-complex is thus

za[] = x{nf },{ie} yv

a( ~nv, ~v).

(14)

 case b. in this case, as in case a, faces are colored by simple representation nf of so(4). each edge, however,
is colored by a single, xed, intertwiner ibc, the (normalized) barrett-crane intertwiner [1]. the amplitude
of the faces is af (nf ) = dimnf for simple representations, dimn = (n + 1)2. the amplitude of the vertex
tv( ~nv, ~v) is the 15-j wigner symbol constructed from the ten simple representations ~nv and the ve barrett-
crane intertwiners ibc. thus, the amplitude of a 2-complex is

zb[] = x{nf } yf

dimnf yv

a( ~nv, ibc ).

(15)

this is precisely the barrett-crane amplitude for a triangulation  whose dual 2-skeleton is .3

iii. mode expansion

consider a square integrable function (g) over so(4), invariant under the right action of so(3). using peter-weyl

theorem, one can expand it in the matrix elements d()

 (g) of the irreducible representations 

(g) = x

 d()


 (g)

(16)

the indices ,  label basis vectors in the corresponding representation space, and the sum over repeated indices is
understood. in other words, we choose a basis in the representation space such that the metric in this basis is just
the kronecker delta, which is the standard choice in representation theory literature. the requirement of invariance
under the right so(3) action can be written as

(g) = z

so(3)

dh (gh).

expanding this into the modes, we have

(g) = x

 d()


 (g) = z

so(3)

dh (gh) = x

z

so(3)

dh 

 (h).

 d()

 (g) d()

(17)

(18)

3reference [1] is a bit obscure concerning the amplitudes of the lower dimensional simplices of the triangulation, for which
it refers to [17], where a dierent normalization is used. a careful analysis of the requirements put on these factors, and in
particular of the requested invariance under change of basis in k ~ne
(see [1], section iv), implies that the correct factors (using
our normalization) are precisely as in (15).

5

the integral in the last term projects the  index over a (normalized) so(3) invariant vector, which we denote by
w. as this exists only in simple representations (and is unique, see the appendix), the sum over representations 
reduces to a sum over the simple representations n only, and thus

(g) = xn

 d(n )
n

 (g) w .

(19)

the quantities h n
functions on the three-sphere: h n

 (g) = d(n )

 (g)w are invariant under the (right) action of so(3), and, thus, can be thought of as
 (x). in fact, they form an orthogonal basis for s3 spherical harmonics.

 (g) = h n

since  is real, we have

xn

 d(n )
n

 (g) w = xn

 d(n )
n

 (g) w.

(20)

in the appendix, we show that the invariant vectors w are real, and that the matrix elements can also be chosen to
be real. thus, the reality condition simply requires n

 to be real.

let us now consider the eld (g1, g2, g3, g4). from the observations above, it follows that the property (7) implies

that the eld can be expanded as

(g1, . . . , g4) = xn1...n4

1...4 d(n1)
n1...n4

11

(g1) . . . d(n4)
44

(g4) w1 . . . w4 .

(21)

as before, the sum over repeated internal indices is understood. finally, the symmetry of (g1, . . . , g4) under permu-
tation of its four arguments implies that

1...4 = n (1)...n(4)
n1...n4
 (1)... (4) ,

(22)

where  is any permutation of {1, 2, 3, 4}.
in terms of the modes. the analysis is dierent for the two cases a and b.

let us now nd nd the eect of the so(4) invariance property on the modes, and nd the expression for the action

case a. substituting the mode expantion (21) into the denition of 

(g1 . . . g4) = z

so(4)

dg (gg1, . . . , gg4),

and using formula (b8) for integral of the product of four group elements, one obtains

fig. 2. the propagator can be represented by a collection of four strands, each carrying a simple representation.

fig. 3. the structure of the vertex of the fat 5-valent graphs generated by the feynman expansion.

the set of feynman rules one gets is similar in the two cases. first, we obtain the usual overal factor v[]/sym[]
(see for instance [24], page 93). next, we represent each of the terms in the right hand side of the denitions (42,45)
of the propagator by four parallel strands, as in fig. 2, carrying the indices at their end. then, we can represent
the propagator itself by the symmetrization of the four strands. in addition, in case a, edges e are labeled by a
representation e (not necessarily simple).

the feynman graphs we gets are all possible 4-strand 5-valent graphs, where a 4-strand graph is a graph whose
edges are collections of four strands, and whose vertices are the ones shown in fig. 3. each strand of the propagator
can be connected to a single strand in each of the ve openings of the vertex. orientations in the vertex and in
the propagators should match (this can always be achieved by changing a representation to its conjugate). each
strand of the 4-strand graph, goes through several vertices and several propagators, and then closes to itself, forming
a cycle. note that a particular strand can go through a particular edge of the 4-strand graph more than once. cycles
get labeled by the simple representations of the indices. for each graph, the abstract set formed by the vertices,
the edges, and the cycles forms a 2-complex, in which the faces are the cycles. the labeling of the cycles by simple
representations of so(4) determines a coloring of the faces by spins. thus, we obtain a colored 2-simplex, namely a
spin foam.

in case a, edges e are labeled by an intertwiner with index e (in the basis (b3)). vertices v contribute a factor 
times a, (see (29)), which depends on ten simple representations labeling the cycles that go through the vertex, and
on ve intertwiners, basis elements in k ~ne
, labeling the edges that meet at v. each edge contracts two vertices, say
v and v. it contributes a matrix m. this is the matrix of the change of basis from the basis in k ~ne
used at v and
the basis used at v. if we x a basis of intertwiners ie in k ~ne
for every e, once and for all for each xed 2-complex
that is, for each assigned permutation in (45) and use vertex amplitude a( ~nv,~iv) given in (31), the matrix m is
absorbed into the vertex amplitude and the propagator is the identity. the weight of 2-complex  is then given by
(14).

in case b, there are no labeling of edges, and we gets an additional contribution from the summing of the s
indices of the kroneker deltas 
around each cycle. this gives a factor dimnf for every face f . thus, faces f are
labeled by simple representations nf and contribute a factor dimnf . vertices contribute a factor  times b, where b
is the barrett-crane weight (15), which depends on the ten simple representations of the faces adjacent to the vertex.
this yields the result (15).

v. triangulations, orientation and symmetries of 

in this section we comment on the relation between 2-complexes and triangulations, and we discuss some possible

modication of our models, which leads to oriented 2-complexes.

 given a triangulation , the (abstract combinatorial structure of its) dual 2-skeleton, () is a 2-complex. in
general, not every 2-complex comes from a triangulation triangulation of a 4-manifold in this way. in 3d, one

9

can nicely characterize the 2-complexes that are derived from triangulations [25]. since this characterization
introduces an interesting technology, we mention it here, adapted from [25].

as we have seen, a 2-complex corresponds to a 4-strand graph. consider a sequence of edges forming a closed
loop in the graph, starting with an edge e. label the strands of e, say with integers (1,2,3 in 3d, and 1,2,3,4
in 4d). the labeling can be carried over to the next edge in the loop, say e by noticing that the strands of
e are naturally paired with the strands of e: a strand in e and a strand in e are paired either if they are the
same strand that continues across the vertex, or if they both continue across the vertex into an edge e. thus,
the labeling can be carried over the loop. in closing the loop, we obtain a new labeling of the strands of e. if
the new labeling is an even (respectively odd) permutation of the original labeling, we say that the loop is even
(respectively odd).

in 3d we have the following result [25]. if, and only if, each cycle (a loop that bounds a face) of the 2-complex
is even, we can thicken faces, edges and vertices of the 2-complex, obtaining a 3 manifold with boundaries,
whose spine is the 2-complex . if, in addition, each component of the boundary of this manifold is a sphere, we
can then ll the sphere with a ball, and obtain a triangulated manifold, whose dual 2-skeleton is the 2-complex.
we are not aware of related results in 4d.

 next, let us now consider the notion of orientation. the notion of orientability of a manifold can be extended
to abstract, n-dimensional triangulations. in n dimensions, an n -simplex s has n + 1 points (0-simplices) in
its boundary. an orientation of s is a choice of an ordering of these n + 1 points, up to even permutations. an
n -simplex is bounded by n+1 (n -1)-simplices. each of these is bounded by n-2 points, obtained by dropping
one of the points of the n-simplex. each (n -1)-simplex inherits an (outgoing) orientation from the n-simplex.
this can be obtained by dropping the missing point in an even ordering of the points of the (n -1)-simplices
in which this missing point is rst. two n -simplices that share an (n -1)-simplex have consistent orientation if
the shared (n -1)-simplex inherits opposite orientations from the two n -simplices it bounds. a triangulation is
orientable if it admits a consistent orientations of all its n-simplices. clearly, the triangulation of an orientable
manifold is orientable.

now, the notion of orientability extends to 2-complexes with 4-valent edges and 5-valent vertices. in fact, notice
that in the boundary of an n -simplex of a triangulation, the (n -1)-simplices are paired with the points (the point
that does not belong to the (n -1)-simplex). thus, the ordering of the points corresponds to an ordering of the
(n -1)-simplices. consequently, we can simply dene the orientation of a vertex of a 2-complex as an ordering
of its adjacent edges, up to even permutations.
in turn, the orientation of a vertex induces an (outgoing)
orientation of its adjacent edges, namely an ordering of the faces, obtained as above. the orientation of two
vertices separated by an edge is consistent if the edge inherits opposite orientations from the two vertices. the
2-complex is orientable if it admits a consistent orientation of all its vertices. clearly, a 2-complex is orientable
if all its loops (not just the cycles) are even. a 2-complex derived from a triangulation of an orientable manifold,
is orientable.

it is not dicult to modify our eld theory in such a way that it generates only orientable 2-complexes. to do
that, it is sucient to replace the requirement that  is symmetric under any permutation of its arguments, eq.
(8) with

(g1, g2, g3, g4) = (ge (1), ge (2), ge (3), ge (4)),

(47)

where e is an even permutation, and to rewrite the action as

s[] =

1

2 z

yi=1

5! z

(48)

(g4, g5, g6, g7) (g7, g3, g8, g9) (g9, g6, g2, g10) (g10, g8, g5, g1).

(this action is the same as (11) if  is symmetric under any permutation of its arguments.) if we do so, the
propagators (42) and (45) contain odd permutations only. a moment of scrutiny of the vertex shows that
the pairing of the strands discussed above (in dening the parity of the loops) determines always an odd
permutation. if we consider a loop of edges in the feynman diagram, we cross an equal number of vertices and
edges. therefore the strands undergo an even number of odd permutations. therefore in closing the loop we
obtain an even permutation. therefore all loops are even and the 2-complex is orientable.

 other versions of the model can be dened by considering more complicated symmetry properties of the function
. in particular, there are 5 irreducible representation of the permutation group of 4 elements 4. two of these

10

are one-dimensional (the trivial and the signature), and the other three have dimensions 2,3 and 5. if we denote
i(g), i = 1, 5 the character of these representations, we can dene ve dierent elds

i(g1, g2, g3, g4) =

1

4! x4

i()i(g(1), g(2), g(3), g(4)).

using the orthonormality of the characters, the original eld is totally determined by the i

 = xi

i(1)i.

(49)

(50)

taking the eld  to be one of the i leads to ve dierent models having slightly dierent feynman rules.
the propagator associated with permutation gets multiplied by the character of this permutation in the given
representation, and so on. finally, one can perhaps add the actions of these ve models, and use the coupling
constants to try to control the topologies appearing in the feynman expansion.

we close with some general comments.

vi. conclusion

 the results of this paper generalize easily to higher dimensions. in dimension d, we replace the group so(4)
with so(d), the sphere s3 with sd1 = so(d)/so(d  1). the eld  is dened over d copies of the so(d).
the interaction term is of order d + 1 and has the structure of a d-simplex. the simple representations of
so(d) are discussed in details in [23]. in any dimension, case b yields the higher-dimensional generalizations
of barrett-crane model discussed in [23].

 the sum over spin foam we have obtained is presumably divergent. there are two sources of divergences.

the rst is the sum over the colorings. this divergence can be regulated by replacing the clebsch-gordan
coecients of the group with the ones of the corresponding quantum group, with qk = 1, as in the barrett-
crane model. this procedure cuts o the sum over representations, and thus makes this sum nite. in this
regard, we think that it would be interesting to explore the construction of the eld theory presented here, but
over a non-commutative 3-sphere.

the second source of divergences is the sum over 2-complexes. the number n of di-inequivalent triangulations
of a given four dimensional manifold grows exponentially only with the number n of simplices [26]. that is
n (n) < exp{n} for large n. this fact suggests that the sum might converge for  smaller than a critical
value, determined by  [27]. on the other hand, the feynman expansion generates triangulations of arbitrary
manifolds, and this might destroy the convergence.

 the barrett-crane model has been obtained by quantizing a geometric 4-simplex [1]. that is, by realizing
certain geometrical quantities, as the bivectors that can be associated to the faces of the tetrahedron, as
in the quantum theory, the condition on bivectors
operators. simple representations emerge in this process:
that they describe planes in r4 translates into the the simplicity condition (a1) on the representation. in turn,
the condition that these planes intersect along lines determines the barrett-crane intertwiner (see also [28]).
the model described here as case a can be seen as a dierent solution to this intersection constraint. in detail,
consider a single tetrahedron of a triangulation. the tetrahedron belongs to two dierent 4-simplices. in the
barrett-crane model, one quantizes each 4-simplex separately. the corresponding intersection constraint is
imposed two times. if, alternatively, we view the tetrahedron as a single element of the triangulation, we may
expect a single constraint corresponding to the requirement that the two faces intersect on a line. the vertex
of the model a satises the intersection constraint in this sense. indeed, it satises the identity pictured in fig.
4. thus, the model of case a provides another solution to the intersection constraints.

 we close with a comment on the physical interpretation of the theory we have described. consider the model of
case a. the eld is n1...n4 . the indices corresponds to the assignment of a (simple) representations to each
face of a tetrahedron, and of an (arbitrary) intertwiner to the bulk of the tetrahedron. this assignment can be
thought as the assignment of metric properties to the tetrahedron: indeed, we know from loop quantum gravity
[3,29] and from other approaches [21], that the nis are naturally related to the area of the faces, and their
intertwiner to the volume. [more precisely, the intrinsic geometry of a classical tetrahedron in 4d is determined

by six numbers (4x4 coordinates of the vertices, minus ten dimensions from the poincare group), but two of
these quantities do not commute as quantum operators and therefore only ve quantum numbers x the state.]
therefore, we can view n1...n4  as a quantum amplitude for a certain geometry of a tetrahedron or, more
generally, of an elementary chunk of space, with a certain volume, and bounded by four elementary surfaces
with a certain area. correspondingly, we can view the eld (x1 . . . x4) as the fourier transform of such
amplitude. from this perspective, the quantum theory dened by the action (11) is the second quantization
of the quantum theory of the geometry of an elementary chunk of space. as a second quantized theory, it is a
multiparticle theory, in which particles are created and destroyed. four dimensional spacetime can thus be
viewed as a feynman history of creations, destruction and interactions of these elementary quanta of space.

appendix a: some facts on representation theory

we collect here some facts on the representation theory of so(d). we label nite dimensional irreducible represen-
tation of so(d) by their highest weight .  is a vector of length n = [d/2] ([] is the integral part):  = (n1, , nn),
where ni are integer and n1    nn. if we are interested in representations of spin(d) we let the ni be half
integers. the representation labeled by the highest weight  = (n, 0, , 0) are called simple or spherical. let
xij, 1  i, j  d be a basis of the lie algebra of so(d). the simple representation are the ones for which the
simplicity relations

are satised. here, [] denotes the antisymmetrisation. the representation space vn of a simple representation can
be realized as a space of spherical harmonics, that is, harmonic homogeneous polynomial on rd. any l2 function on
the sphere can be uniquely decomposed in terms of these spherical harmonics

x[ijxij]  vn = 0

(a1)

in the case of so(4), since spin(4) = su (2)  su (2), there is an alternate description of the representation as

products of two representations j and j of su (2). the relation with the highest weight presentation is given by

l2(sd1) = 

n =0vn .

(a2)

n1 = j + j,

n2 = j + j.

(a3)

the simple representation are therefore the representation in which j = j := j. thus, we can label simple represen-
tations with a half integer spin j. notice that the integer color n = 2j is also the (nonvanishing component of the)
highest weight of the representation.

12

an elementary illustration of these simple representations can be given as follows. the vectors v of the repre-
b1... bj with j undotted symmetrized indices ai = 1, 2,
sentation  = (j, j) can be written as spinors a1...aj
transforming under one of the su (2), and j dotted antisymmetrized indices bi = 1, 2 transforming under the
other. consider the particular vector w which (in the spinor notation, and in a given basis) has components
b1... bj = (a1 b1 . . . aj ) bj , where a b is the unit antisymmetric tensor, and the symmetrization is over the
a1...aj
ai indices only. the subgroup of so(4) that leaves this vector invariant is a so(3) subgroup of so(4) (which depends
on the basis chosen). clearly, since a b is the only object invariant under this su(2), a normalized so(3) invariant
vector (and only one) exists in these simple representations only.

equivalently, the simple representations of so(4) are the ones dened by the completely symmetric traceless 4d
tensors of rank n . the invariant vector w is then the traceless part of the tensor with (in the chosen basis) all
component vanishing except w444.... the so(3) subgroup is given by the rotations around the fourth coordinate axis.
the relation between the vector and spinor representation is obtained contracting the spinor indices with the (four)
pauli matrices: v1...j = a1...aj

in the main text we have used the following properties of the simple representations

 let v be a representation of so(d), we say that   v is a spherical vector if it is invariant under the action
of so(d  1). such a vector exists if and only if the representation is simple. in that case this vector is unique
up to normalization.

let  be a vector of v, and consider an orthonormal basis vi of v. we can construct the following functions
on g:

i(g) =< |d1(g)|vi > .

(a4)

these functions span a subspace of l2(g). the group acts on this subspace by the right regular representation,
if  is spherical, then these
and the corresponding representation is equivalent to the representation v.
functions are in fact l2 functions on the quotient space so(d)/so(d  1) = sd1 and v is therefore a
spherical representation. on the other hand, if the representation is spherical then we can construct a spherical
vector: (g) = pi i(g)i(1). when  is spherical, the spherical function  is a function on the double
quotient space so(d  1)\so(d)/so(d  1) = u (1). it is now a standard exercise to show that there is a
unique harmonic polynomial on rd invariant by so(d  1) of a given degree, hence there is a unique spherical
function.

 the space of intertwiner of three representations of so(4) is at most one dimensional.

the dimension n1,2,3 of the space of intertwiner between three representations 1, 2, 3 is given by the
integral

n1,2,3 = z dg 1 (g)2 (g)3 (g)

(a5)

where  are the characters of the representation . for so(4), since any representation is the product of
two representation of su (2) the intertwining number of three so(4) representation is the product of su (2)
intertwining numbers. it is well known that this number is 0 or 1 for su (2).

 the representation of so(n ) are real. this means that it is always possible to choose a basis of v such that
the representation matrices are real. if we are interested by representation of half integer spin of spin(n ) it is
still true that  is equivalent to its complex conjugate or dual. however the isomorphism is non trivial. the
dierence between this two case can be characterized by the value of the following integral

i = z dg (g2).

(a6)

this is +1 if  is an integer spin representation and 1 if  is a half-integer spin representation. this is easily
seen in the case of spin(4), since any representation is the product of two representations of su (2) the integral
(a6) reduces to the product of two su (2) integrals.

next, consider four representations n1 . . . n4. they are dened on the hilbert spaces h1 . . . h4. consider the
tensor product hn1...n4 = h1  . . .  h4. this space decomposes into irreducibles. in particular, it contains the
trivial representation, with a certain multiplicity m. we denote the m dimensional subspace of hn1...n4 formed by
the trivial representations, that is, the so(4) invariant subspace of hn1...n4 as kn1...n4. the space kn1...n4, its
scalar product, and its subspaces play a key role in the spin foam models. when the representations n1 . . . n4 are
associated to the four edges adjacent to the edge e, we write kn1...n4 also as k ~ne
. the vectors in kn1...n4 are the
intertwiners between the representations n1 . . . n4. they are so(4) invariant tensors with four indices, one in each
representation hi. we write them as v n1...n4
. an orthonormal basis in kn1...n4 can be obtained as follows. we pair
the representations as (n1, n2), (n3, n4). then we dene

as  runs over the nite number of representations for which the (3  j)-symbols do not vanish, the c n1...n4 
form
an orthonormal basis of kn1...n4. the factor dim normalizes these vectors in kn1...n4 . clearly, there are other
bases of this kind, obtained by pairing the indices in a dierent manner. for example, we can we pair the indices as
(n1, n2), (n3, n4) and dene the basis

and a corresponding matrix of change of basis m n1n2n3n4

finally, we derive equation (34) used in the main text. using the ambiguity in the denition of the (3  j)-symbol,

which so far is dened up to a phase factor, we can choose it so that the quantity
