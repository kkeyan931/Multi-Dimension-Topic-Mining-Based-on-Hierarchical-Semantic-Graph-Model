abstract

majorana-weyl spacetimes oer a rich algebraic setup and new types of space-time dualities
besides those discussed by hull. the triality automorphisms of spin(8) act non-trivially on
majorana-weyl representations and majorana-weyl spacetimes with dierent signatures. in
particular relations exist among the (1 + 9)  (5 + 5)  (9 + 1) spacetimes, as well as their
transverse coordinates spacetimes (0 + 8)  (4 + 4)  (8 + 0). larger dimensional spacetimes
such as (2 + 10)  (6 + 6)  (10 + 2) also show dualities induced by triality. a precise
three-languages dictionary is here given. it furnishes the exact translations among, e.g., the
three dierent versions (one in each signature) of the ten-dimensional n = 1 superstring and
superyang-mills theories. their dualities close the six-element permutation group s3. bilinear
and trilinear invariants allowing to formulate theories with a manifest space-time symmetry are
constructed.

1 introduction.

physical theories formulated in dierent-than-usual spacetimes signatures have recently found
increased attention. one of the reasons can be traced to the conjectured f -theory [1] which
supposedly lives in (2 + 10) dimensions [2]. the current interest in ads theories motivated by
the ads/cft correspondence furnishes another motivation. two-time physics e.g. has started
been explored by bars and collaborators in a series of papers [3]. for another motivation we
can also recall that a fundamental theory is expected to explain not only the spacetime dimen-
sionality, but even its signature (see [4]). quite recently hull and hull-khuri [5] pointed out
the existence of dualities relating dierent compactications of theories formulated in dierent
signatures. such a result provides new insights to the whole question of spacetime signatures.
other papers (the most recent is [6]) have remarked the existence of space-time dualities.

majorana-weyl spacetimes (i.e. those supporting majorana-weyl spinors) are at the very
core of the present knowledge of the unication via supersymmetry, being at the basis of ten-
dimensional superstrings, superyang-mills and supergravity theories (and perhaps the already
mentioned f -theory). a well-established feature of majorana-weyl spacetimes is that they are
endorsed of a rich structure. a legitimate question one can ask oneself is whether they are
aected, and how, by space-time dualities. the answer is quite surprising (in fact it should
not be so, with afterthought), the structure of dualities is much richer than expected and
potentially able to shed a complete new light on the subject. indeed all dierent majorana-weyl
spacetimes which are possibly present in any given dimension are each-other related by duality
transformations which are induced by the spin(8) triality automorphisms. the action of the
triality automorphisms is quite non-trivial and has far richer consequences than the z2-duality
(its most trivial representative) associated to the space-time (s, t)  (t, s) exchange discussed in
[4]. it corresponds to s3, the six-element group of permutations of three letters, identied with
the group of congruences of the triangle and generated by two reections. the lowest-dimension
in which the triality action is non-trivial is 8 (not quite a coincidence), where the spacetimes
(8 + 0) (4 + 4) (0 + 8) are all interrelated. they correspond to the transverse coordinates of
the (9 + 1) (5 + 5) (1 + 9) spacetimes respectively, where the triality action can also be lifted.
triality relates as well the 12-dimensional majorana-weyl spacetimes (10+2)(6+6)(2+10),
i.e. the potentially interesting cases for the f -theory, and so on.
as a consequence of triality, supersymmetric theories formulated with majorana-weyl spinors
in a given dimension but with dierent signatures, are all dually mapped one into another. a
three-language dictionary is here furnished with the exact translations among, e.g., the dierent
versions of the 10-dimensional mw supersymmetric theories, formulated in the majorana-weyl
representation.

the strategy here followed is based in three steps. at rst it is shown that majorana-weyl
spacetimes in dimensions d > 8 can be recovered from the properties of the 8-dimensional
majorana-weyl spacetimes and -matrices representations. next, working in d = 8, we con-
struct, for each one of the three majorana-weyl spacetimes (8 + 0), (4 + 4), (0 + 8), the bridge
transformations relating the corresponding majorana-weyl representations to the represen-

1

tations (called vca in the text) which exhibit manifest triality among vectors, chiral and
antichiral spinors. as a nal step new bridge transformations of spacetime kind, relating
among them the vca representations constructed in each one of the majorana-weyl space-
times above, are given.

we emphasize that, contrary to hull [5], the dualities here discussed are already present for

the uncompactied theories and in this respect look more fundamental.

moreover, bilinear and trilinear invariants under the s3 permutation group of the three
majorana-weyl spacetimes are constructed. they can be possibly used to formulate supersym-
metric majorana-weyl theories in a manifestly triality-invariant form which presents an explicit
symmetry under exchange of space and time coordinates.

the present paper is intended to be an abridged version, suitable for a letter-size, of a
forthcoming extended version which presents in full detail the construction and where extra
results which are outside the scope of this letter are also furnished.

the scheme of this work is as follows.

in the next section we recall, following [7] and
[8], the basic properties of -matrices and majorana conditions needed for our construction.
majorana-type representations are analyzed in section 3. we show how to relate the majorana-
weyl representations in d > 8 to the 8-dimensional majorana-weyl representations. in section
4 we introduce, for d = 8, the set of data necessary to dene a supersymmetric majorana-weyl
theory, i.e. the set of words of our three-languages dictionary. the cartans [9] triality among
vectors, chiral and antichiral spinors is presented in section 5. the main result is furnished in
section 6, where spacetime triality is discussed. in the conclusions we furnish some comments
and point out some perspectives.

2 preliminary results.

here we limit ourselves to introduce the basic ingredients needed for our constructions.

further information is found in [7] and [8].

we denote as gmn the at (pseudo-)euclidean metric of a (t + s)-spacetime. time (space)

directions in our conventions are associated to the + (respectively ) sign.
the s matrices are assumed to be unitary (the chosen normalization is for the square of
time-like -matrices being +1). the three matrices a, b, c are the generators of the three
conjugation operations (hermitian, complex conjugation and transposition respectively) on the
s. in particular

cmc = (1)t+1mt

(1)

where  = 1 in even-dimensional spacetimes label inequivalent choices of the charge conjuga-
tion matrix c.

a, b, c are related by the formula

c = bta

(2)

up to an inessential phase, a is specied by the product of all the time-like  matrices. an
unitary transformations u applied on spinors act on m, a, b, c according to [8]

m 7 umu 

2

a 7 uau 
b 7 u bu 
c 7 u cu 

(3)

a majorana representation for the s can be dened as the one in which b is set equal to the
identity. spinors can be assumed real in this case.
in even dimensions we can also introduce the notion of weyl representation, i.e. when the
generalized 5 matrix is symmetric and block diagonal and with no loss of generality can be
assumed to be the direct sum of the two equal-size blocks 1  (1). the compatibility of both
majorana and weyl conditions constraints the spacetime (t + s) to satisfy

s  t = 0 mod

8,

for

both

values

 = 1

in even dimensions majorana representations, but not of weyl type, are also found for

s  t = 2 mod 8 f or
s  t = 6 mod 8 f or

 = 1;
 = +1.

(4)

(5)

for d < 8 the only spacetimes supporting majorana-weyl spinors have signatures (n + n). at
d = 8 a new feature arises, majorana-weyl spinors can be found for dierent signatures.

3 majorana-type representations.

it is convenient to introduce the notion of majorana-type representation (or shortly mtr)
for the  matrices as one in which all the s have a denite symmetry. for d = p + q a mtr
with p symmetric and q antisymmetric s will be denoted as (ps, qa) in the following.

for such representations the c matrix introduced in the previous section is given by either
the product of all the symmetric  matrices, denoted as cs, or all the antisymmetric ones (ca).
in even dimensions cs, ca correspond to opposite values of  in (1).
a majorana representation in a given signature spacetime is a mtr. conversely, given
a mtr, we can nd a spacetime signature for which the representation is majorana. the
admissible couples of (ps, qa) values for a mtr are immediately read from the majorana tables
given above (4) and (5). the construction is such that c must correspond to the correct value
of  in the tables.
the list of all possible mtrs in any given dimension is easily computed. in order just to
give an example one can check that in d = 6 there exists a mtr (not of weyl kind) with 6
anticommuting  matrices plus an anticommuting 7 (0s, 6a, 7
a). it gives the majorana basis
in the euclidean 6-dimensional space.

in d = 8 the mtrs of weyl type are (8s, 0a), (4s, 4a), (0s, 8a), associated to the corre-

sponding majorana-weyl spacetimes.

dierent mtrs belong to dierent classes under similarity transformations of the s rep-

resentations. indeed in, lets say, an euclidean (all + signs) space, the index

i = tr(m  m

t ) = (ps  qa)  tr1

(6)

takes dierent values for dierent mtrs.

3

we computed explicitly all mtrs up to d = 12 and majorana-weyl representations up
to d = 14 (the results will be furnished elsewhere) by using a recursive algorithm presented
in [10].
it allows producing weyl representations in d dimensions from any given couple of
representations in r and s dimensions, for even-dimensional d, r, s satisfying d = r + s + 2. the
only mtr up to d = 12 which does not directly t into this scheme, the above-mentioned 6-
dimensional (0s, 6a), is however constructed from the (3s, 3a) representation (this one directly
produced from the 2-dimensional pauli matrices for r = s = 2) after computing the value of the
symmetric matrix b in the euclidean 6-dimensional space, and later nding the transformation
(3) which maps it into the unity.

the algorithm is given by the formula

i=1,...,s+1 = x  1l  s

d
s+1+j=s+2,...,d = y  r

i=1,...,s+1

j=1,...,r+1  1r

d

(7)

where 1l,r are the unit-matrices in the respective spaces, while x = e12 + e21 and y =
r+1 corresponds to the generalized 5-
ie12 + ie21 are the 2-dimensional pauli matrices. r
matrix in r + 1 dimensions.
in the above formula the values r, s = 0 are allowed. the
corresponding 0

1 is just 1.

with the help of the above formula we have a very ecient tool to reduce the analysis of
majorana-weyl representations for d  10 to the 8-dimensional case, since we can always set
either r or s equal to 8 (or possibly both, which corresponds to the d = 18 case). up to d = 14
majorana-weyl spacetimes exist for three dierent signatures and the same situation of d = 8
is repeated. a new feature arises for d  16. a careful analysis of the consistency conditions is
needed in this case, since the triality transformations that we later discuss no longer preserve
the similarity classes of mtrs; stated otherwise, dierent representatives of mtrs in the
same similarity class and for the same couple of values (ps, qa) are mapped under a given
triality transformation into representatives of mtr belonging to dierent similarity classes.
this feature is likely to be related with the problems encountered in dening supersymmetric
theories in dimensions greater than 14, which have been e.g. pointed out in [11].

in any case the construction here discussed is suited to analyze and works perfectly well for
the range d = 8, ..., 14, i.e. the cases which are of interest for, among the others, the superstrings
and the f-theory (notice that the above scheme can nd applications to dualities also for odd-
dimensional majorana spacetimes as the 11-dimensional ones supporting the m-theory, we will
comment more on that in the conclusions). we postpone to the extended version of this paper
the presentation of the full set of reconstruction formulas which make explicit the construction
of mw-spacetimes in dimensions d > 8 in terms of the 8-dimensional ones. for the purpose of
this paper is sucient to recall that such reconstruction formulas can be given. in particular
the higher dimensional c charge conjugation matrices for d > 8 can be expressed in terms of
the eight-dimensional matrices c8.
4 the set of data for d = 8.

in this section we present the set of data needed to specify a majorana-weyl supersymmetric
theory formulated in 8-dimensions. as we have stated in the previous section, this set of
data can be lifted to dene majorana-weyl supersymmetric theories formulated in higher-
dimensions. the results here furnished therefore have a more general validity.

4

at rst we recall that we have three dierent majorana-weyl spacetimes (8 + 0) (4 + 4)
(0 + 8) and two choices for  = 1, so in total 3  2 = 6 inequivalent theories (i.e. inequivalent
versions of some given supersymmetric theory) that can be formulated in d = 8.
each one of these versions is characterized by the following set of data all expressed in the
corresponding majorana-weyl representation, being this one the most suitable for analyzing
supersymmetry. such data will play the roles of the words in the three-languages dictionary
that will be later furnished:

i) the bosonic (and/or vector-elds) coordinates xm, with vector index m = 1, ..., 8;
ii) the fermionic coordinates (and/or spinorial elds) a,  a, with chiral and antichiral

indices a = 1, ..., 8, a = 1, ..., 8 respectively;

iii) the diagonal (pseudo-)orthogonal spacetime metric (g1)mn, gmn;
iv) the a matrix of section 2, used to introduce barred spinors, which is now decomposed
b and

in an equal-size block diagonal form such as a = a  a, with structure of indices (a)a
( a) a

b

respectively;

v) the charge-conjugation matrix c, always symmetric, also put in equal-size block diagonal
form c = c 1  c 1. since c is invariant under bispinorial transformations it can be promoted
to be a metric for the space of chiral (and respectively antichiral) spinors, used to raise and
lower spinorial indices. indeed we can set (c 1)ab, (c)ab, and ( c 1) ab, ( c) ab;

vi) nally we have the upper-left  and the lower-right  blocks in the s matrices with

structure of indices (m)a

b and (m) a

b respectively.

in the majorana-weyl representation.

the b matrix is automatically set to be the identity (b = 1) due to our choice of working
in order to work in the majorana-weyl basis for each one of the six dierent versions of the
theory, the correct majorana-type representation must be picked up. in (4 + 4) the (4s, 4a)
representation must be chosen for both values of , while in (8 + 0) the (8s, 0a) works for
 = +1 and the (0s, 8a) works for  = 1 (and conversely in the (0 + 8) case).
we have

for later purpose it is convenient to present the matrix c for each one of the six versions.

c = 9 = 18  (18)
c = 116
c = (c 1)  (c 1)

in (8 + 0)
in (0 + 8)
in (4 + 4)

(8)

where in the last case c 1 can be chosen to be the 8 8 matrix with (+ + ++) entries
in the antidiagonal and 0 entries in any other position.

5 the v-c-a triality.

the outer automorphisms of the d4 lie algebra is responsible for the triality property among
the 8-dimensional vector, chiral and antichiral spinor representations of so(8) which has been
rst discussed by cartan [9].

in our language the triality property can be restated as follows. the c 1, c 1 matrices
introduced in the previous section, for each one of the six dierent cases we discussed, are
symmetric and with the same set (up to an overall sign) of eigenvalues (1) as the corresponding
g1 spacetime metric.

5

in each one of the above cases one can simultaneously map both c 1, c 1 (with dierent

similarity transformations g, g) into the corresponding spacetime g1 metric:

g : c 1
c 1
g :

7 g1 = g  c 1  gt
7 g1 = g  c 1  gt

(9)

the structure of indices for g and its inverse g1 is (g)m
m (an analogous structure
holds for g, and g1). therefore g, g can be used to transform chiral (antichiral) indices in
vector indices allowing to work with, lets say, vector indices alone.

a and (g1)a

the concrete 8  8-dimensional matrices g, g are of course not uniquely dened since any
other matrix of the kind lc  g  lg, with lc, lg preserving by similarity the c 1 and the g1
metrics respectively, are equally well suited. for our purposes however it is sucient to furnish
a concrete representative for the g, g matrices.

in all the above cases we can choose the concrete matrices g, g to be square root of unity:

g2 = g2 = 18

(10)

indeed the only case in the previous section discussion where c 1 ( c 1) is not diagonal is the
(4 + 4) case, with c 1 given in (8) and c 1 = c 1. a matrix g which sets c 1 to the
diagonal form (+ + + +   ) is

(11)

in all the other cases we have to ip a number n of signs in the diagonal, with n = 0 mod
4.
instead of working with the standard wick rotation prescription, which is the only one
applicable for odd numbers of signs to be ipped, a smarter choice is allowed for even numbers
of ipping: the passage e.g. from (++) 7 () can be produced via similarity with the help
of the y pauli matrix y = ie12 + ie21, through

y  12  y

t = 12

(12)

2 = 12 and is antisymmetric. the bridge matrices g which ip the
of course y satises y
euclidean (+ + + + + + ++) metric into the (+ + + +   ) and the (      )
metrics are therefore respectively given by

g1 = 14  y  y
g2 = y  y  y  y

(13)

which are both square root of unity.

the above given bridge operators g, g in a given majorana-weyl spacetime allows to
pass from the majorana-weyl representation to another representation, that we can call vca,

6

where triality is manifest and only vector-like indices are present. please notice that, as far
as transformation properties alone are concerned, the commuting or anticommuting nature of
spinors is not taken into account. for commuting spinors a more radical property holds. bilinear
and trilinear invariants under the s3 permutation group of vectors, chiral and antichiral spinors,
can be constructed. the procedure is as follows. at rst the three bilinear scalars

bv = v t 1v,

bc = t c 1,

ba = t c 1

and the trilinear one

t = t c 11v 

are constructed. applying the above bridge transformations in a passive way we can set

 = (gt )

1

,

 = ( gt )

1



therefore

and their sum

bv = v t 1v,

bc = t 1 ,

ba = t 1 

b = bv + bc + ba

is by construction invariant under the s3 exchange of v, t , .

as for the trilinear term t , it reads as follows

t = t m v 

where the trivector m is given by

m mnp = (1)mr(gt 1

)r

where the sum is extended over all the permutations of v, t , .

the action of the s3 permutation group on the original vectors, chiral and antichiral spinors
is given by the pull-back of the bridge transformations. it is just sucient to write it down for
two of the generators, called p , r, of s3, where

we have

(p r)3 = 1

6 the spacetime triality.

the triality discussed in the previous section is the cartans v  c  a triality, which
connects vectors, chiral and antichiral spinors of the same spacetime. however the procedure
which has been used so far can be repeated to connect vectors belonging to spacetime metrics
with dierent signatures.
in the case of our interest three spacetimes, denoted as x, y, z,
possess vector-indices (m, m, m) which are referred to the metrics
(+ + + + + + ++), (+ + + +   ), (      ) respectively.
the passage from one of the above metrics to another one can be done by employing the same
bridge matrices introduced in (13). the construction straightforwardly repeat the one already
encountered. it should be clear that an enormous technical advantage is oered by performing
the connection between two dierent majorana-weyl spacetimes working in both cases with
the respective vca representations. the spacetime bridge matrices in this case only see
vector indices. the connection between majorana-weyl representations is then reconstructed
in terms of the bridge matrices (introduced in the previous section) linking, in each one of the
two spacetimes, the majorana-weyl with the vca representation.

there is no need to repeat here the formulas presented in section 5. each one nds its
mirror spacetime equivalent. they have just to be reinterpreted in the light of the spacetime
triality.

we just point out that under spacetime triality y m, zm are mapped into

y m 7 ym,

zm 7 zm

carrying a (+ + + + + + ++) vector index-structure.

the bilinear invariant under the s3 group of permutations is

b = x t x

1x + y t x

1 y + z t x

1 z

while the trilinear one is

t = x

perm

m mnpxm y t

n

zp

(24)

(25)

(26)

where the trivector m mnp is constructed in full analogy with (20).

we remark that for what concerns spacetime triality invariances it is likely that we do not
have to bother about the anticommuting character of spinors as it is the case for invariances
under v  c  a triality. for instance, in the simplest example, the bosonic supersymmetric
composite vector x m = xm  im is the building block to introduce the superparticle and
we do not need to worry about grassmann variables.
let us nally comment that the same bridge transformations already encountered can be
used to produce dualities relating the opposite values of . indeed just an overall  sign for
the c 1 matrix distinguishes the two cases.

7 conclusions.

in this paper we have shown that the triality automorphisms of spin(8) not only induce
dualities among dierent-signatures majorana-weyl spacetimes, but also furnish bilinear and

8

trilinear invariants which can be possibly used to formulate supersymmetric theories possessing
a space-time triality invariance.

triality relations connect the various majorana-weyl spacetimes in a given dimension.
the basic strategy of our construction consists in the fact that even for dimensions d > 8
the dierent signatures of majorana-weyl spacetimes can be encoded in the 8-dimensional 
matrices, used as building blocks in the construction of the higher-dimensional s.

the bridge operators connecting in each given majorana-weyl spacetime the majorana-weyl
representation to a cartan-type representation in which the 8-dimensional v  c  a triality is
manifest are helpful in linking together dierent-signatures majorana-weyl spacetimes. indeed
in a cartan-like basis the problem of relating dierent space-time signatures is considerably
simplied since we have to worry about just how to connect vector-like indices and spacetime
metrics.

a complete and extensive list of the results here outlined will be presented in a forthcoming

paper.

the range of possible applications for the methods and the ideas here discussed is vast. we
limit ourselves to mention that we are currently investigating the web of dualities connecting
the 12-dimensional majorana-weyl spacetimes which should support the f -theory (32, taking
into account of ), with the 6 versions of the 11-dimensional majorana spacetimes (for the m-
theory) in (10 + 1), (9 + 2), (6 + 5), (5 + 6), (2 + 9), (1 + 10) signatures and with the dierent
(again 3  2) versions of the 10-dimensional majorana-weyl spacetimes.
