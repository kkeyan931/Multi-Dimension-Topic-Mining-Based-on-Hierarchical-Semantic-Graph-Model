abstract

we construct the eective action of certain exotic branes in the
type ii theories which are not predicted by their spacetime super-
symmetry algebras. we analyze in detail the case of the ns-7b brane,
s-dual to the d7-brane, and connected by t-duality to other exotic
branes in type iia: the kk-6a brane and the kk-8a brane (obtained
by reduction of the m-theory kaluza-klein monopole and m9-brane,
respectively). the ns-7b brane carries charge with respect to the
s-dual of the rr 8-form, which we identify as a non-local combina-
tion of the electric-magnetic duals of the axion and the dilaton. the
study of its eective action agrees with previous results in the litera-
ture showing that it transforms as an sl(2, z) triplet together with
the d7-brane. we discuss why this brane is not predicted by the
type iib spacetime supersymmetry algebra. in particular we show
that the modular transformation relating the d7 and ns-7b brane
solutions can be undone by a simple coordinate transformation in the
two dimensional transverse space, equivalent to choosing a dierent
region to parametrize the sl(2, z) moduli space. we discuss a similar
relation between the d6 and kk-6a branes and the d8 and kk-8a
branes.

1 introduction

it is by now well-known that the bps spectra of the type ii and m- theories
can be obtained by analyzing the central charges that occur in the corre-
sponding supersymmetry algebra [1, 2]. this analysis predicts a 0-brane (the
eleven dimensional pp-wave), a 2-brane, a 5-brane, a 6-brane (the kaluza-
klein monopole) and a 9-brane in m-theory. these branes give rise to the
brane-scan of the type iia theory, namely the 0-brane, the fundamental
string, the ns-5a brane, dp-branes with p even, p = 0, . . . , 8, the kaluza-
klein monopole (or kk-5a brane) and the ns-9a brane. all these branes
are predicted as well by the type iia supersymmetry algebra and other than
the ns-9a brane have been extensively studied in the literature. the ns-9a
brane is a spacetime-lling brane which may play a role in the construction of
the heterotic string as a non-perturbative orientifold of the type iia theory
(see [3] for some results in this direction).

from the type iia brane-scan, via t-duality, one obtains the brane-scan
of the type iib theory, also predicted by its spacetime supersymmetry alge-
bra. it consists on the 0-brane, the fundamental string, the ns-5b brane, dp-
branes with p odd, p = 1, 1, . . . , 9, the kaluza-klein monopole (or kk-5b
brane) and the ns-9b brane. these branes occur as multiplets of the sl(2,z)
symmetry of the theory. namely the (f1,d1), (ns5b,d5) and (ns9b,d9)
branes occur as doublets and the d3-brane, d7-brane and kk-monopole as
singlets. the d9-brane and ns-9b brane are spacetime-lling branes which
are charged with respect to the rr 10-form and its s-dual, a ns-ns 10-
form [4], respectively.
it is well-known that d9-branes play a role in the
construction of the type i theory as an orientifold of type iib. similarly,
it was argued in [5, 3] that ns-9b branes play a role in the construction of
the heterotic so(32) theory as a non-perturbative orientifold of type iib.
in this case 32 ns-9b branes cancel the charge of the orientifold xed plane
associated to the s-dual operation of worldsheet parity reversal.

it has been pointed out however that there exist some brane solutions
in the type iia and type iib theories which are not predicted by their
spacetime supersymmetry algebras. these branes have been encountered
in dierent contexts. on the one hand they are required in order to ll
up multiplets of bps states in representations of the u-duality group of
m-theory on a d-torus [6, 7, 8, 9]. on the other hand they are predicted
by duality from branes that do occur as central charges in the spacetime
supersymmetry algebras.

in particular it is well-known that the kaluza-klein monopole of m-theory
gives rise to the d6-brane after dimensional reduction along its taub-nut
direction and to the type iia kk-monopole after double dimensional reduc-

2

tion. the third possibility, reducing along a transverse direction dierent
from the taub-nut direction, gives rise to a 6-brane in the type iia theory
which contains as well a taub-nut ber direction [6, 7] (we will denote it as
a kk-6a brane) but which is not predicted by the type iia spacetime su-
persymmetry algebra. the corresponding supergravity solution is described
by a harmonic function on r2  s1 and therefore is logarithmically divergent
[7]. this fact was indicated as an explanation for its non-occurrence in the
type iia spacetime supersymmetry algebra [8], given that these algebras are
realized as asymptotic symmetries, with at asymptotic metric. however it
is still striking that the d7-brane, being as well logarithmically divergent, or
the d8-brane, linearly divergent, have associated central charges in the type
iib and type iia spacetime supersymmetry algebras.

a second brane in the type iia theory not predicted either by its space-
time supersymmetry algebra occurs when double dimensionally reducing the
m9-brane. a single m9-brane has associated a killing direction which is
interpreted as a worldvolume direction, and which appears gauged in the ef-
fective action [8, 10, 11]. reduction along this direction gives the d8-brane.
on the other hand, reducing along the transverse direction we obtain the
ns-9a brane mentioned previously, which contains a gauged direction also
interpreted as a worldvolume direction. the third possibility consists in re-
ducing along a worldvolume direction, dierent from the killing direction.
this predicts a new 8-brane in the type iia theory with a gauged direction
in its worldvolume, which we denote as a kk-8a brane.

the kk-6a and kk-8a branes are related by t-duality to a new 7-
brane in type iib (see gure 1) which is also predicted by the s-duality
symmetry of the theory [12, 11]. performing an s-duality transformation in
the worldvolume eective action of a dp-brane in type iib:

s = z dp+1eq|det(g + (2)f )| ,
2 b(2) and b(2) the (pullback of the) ns-ns 2-form, we

(1.1)

with f = 2b + 1
obtain a p-brane with eective action

(1.2)
where f = 2c(1) + 1
2 c (2), c (2) is the (pullback of the) rr 2-form and
b  c(1) under s-duality. for p = 1 (1.2) reduces to the nambu-goto

s = z dp+1e( p1

action of the f-string after dualizing the 1-form c(1) into a constant scalar1.
for p = 3 it does not describe a new 3-brane since worldvolume duality of
c(1) yields the eective action of the d3-brane, showing that this brane is
invariant under s-duality [13]. for p = 5, 9 we obtain the kinetic terms of
the ns-5b and ns-9b brane eective actions2, which form doublets with the
d5 and d9 branes respectively. however, for p = 7 it describes a 7-brane
which is not predicted by the type iib spacetime supersymmetry algebra
and which we will denote as a ns-7b brane. this brane cannot be related
to the d7-brane by worldvolume duality. the corresponding supergravity
solution, as well as its connections via t-duality with the kk-6a and kk-
8a branes in type iia, has been studied in [12]. in this reference it is also
shown that the ns-7b brane can be cast into a triplet of sl(2, z) together
with the d7-brane. the third charge is the magnetic dilaton charge carried
by the 7-brane, and is related to the other two charges upon quantization.
therefore a generic 7-brane can be consistently denoted by two integers. the
values of these integers are further restricted by the characterization of the
7-branes by their monodromy matrices or, equivalently, by the type of strings
that can end on them [15].

it is the purpose of this paper to study in some more detail these exotic
branes in the type iia and type iib theories which are not predicted by
their spacetime supersymmetry algebras, but are however needed in order to
ll up the multiplets of bps states predicted by the e7(z), e8(z) u-duality
groups of m-theory on t 7, t 8 [6, 7, 8, 9]. all the exotic branes that we
analyze share the property that the tension scales with 1/g3
s, with gs the
string coupling constant, so that they are non-perturbative, i.e. they do not
have an obvious interpretation in weakly coupled string theory.

we construct the worldvolume eective actions by means of duality trans-
formations on ordinary branes. we mainly focus on the ns-7b brane, and
we see from its worldvolume eective action that it does not form a doublet
with the d7-brane. we identify the 8-form to which this brane is minimally
coupled as a non-local combination of the electric-magnetic duals of the ax-
ion and the dilaton. this potential needs to be introduced in order to study
the behavior of the d7-brane under s-duality. its eld strength however is
a local combination of the 9-form eld strengths associated to the duals of
the axion and dilaton, so that a dual type iib supergravity, written as a
function of the dual 9-form eld strengths, will not depend on it [16, 17]. at
the level of the solutions we see that the d7 and ns-7b branes are related
by a modular transformation, but that this transformation can be undone

1the value of this scalar xes the number of f-strings after quantization.

figure 1: exotic branes and t-duality. in this gure we show the relation
under t-duality of the dierent branes considered in this article . we also include
the 5-branes and kaluza-klein monopoles for comparison of these relations, as
well as the m-theory origin of the type iia branes. with respect to the type iia
branes, we indicate a t-duality along a worldvolume direction by a solid line, a
t-duality along a killing direction with a dashed line, and a t-duality along a
transverse direction with a dotted line.

by a change of coordinates in the transverse space. this means that both
branes represent the same physical object in dierent coordinate systems,
and therefore should not have associated independent central charges in the
type iib spacetime supersymmetry algebra. the same kind of transforma-
tion identies the kk-6a brane with the d6 brane, and the kk-8a brane
with the d8-brane. this also explains why the kk-6a and kk-8a branes
do not appear in the type iia spacetime supersymmetry algebra.

the paper is organized as follows. in the rst four sections we present
the eective actions of the exotic branes that we have discussed. we start
with the kk-6a brane, which is simply obtained by reducing the m-theory
kaluza-klein monopole. the ns-7b brane is constructed by t-duality from
the kk-6a brane. we see that it is related by s-duality to the d7-brane,
where in this duality transformation the rr 8-form is mapped onto another
8-form which is dened as the t-dual of the gravitational eld with respect
to which the kk-6a brane is charged. we discuss the role played by this
eld within the type iib theory and discuss some properties of the solutions,
in particular we show that the d7 and ns-7b brane solutions correspond to
local versions of the weak and strong coupling limits of the non-perturbative
solution of [18]. in section 4 we construct the eective action of the kk-8a

5

brane and discuss its interpretation within a non-covariant massive type iia
supergravity. in section 5 we give an example of an exotic brane with two
gauged isometries which also has a tension t  1/g3
s and is related to the
other exotic branes by t-duality. this brane is predicted by u-duality of m-
theory on t 8 and should play a role in the description of eight dimensional
massive supergravity. for all these branes we give an analysis of the brane
solitons originated by the boundaries of other branes. finally in section 6
we show that a kaluza-klein monopole in m-theory with an extra isomet-
ric direction can be written as a torus bundle over a two-dimensional base
space, and that a modular transformation in the torus can be undone by a
simple coordinate transformation in the base space. this allows to establish
an equivalence between the branes that can be derived from the m-theory
kaluza-klein monopole after reduction and t-duality, in particular between
the d6 and the kk-6a branes and the d7 and the ns-7b branes. we also
discuss the relation between the kk-8a brane and the d8-brane, using the
same construction. finally, we comment on the origin of this equivalence
from the point of view of the m9-brane.

2 the iia kk6-brane

this brane is obtained by reducing the m-theory kk-monopole eective ac-
tion along a transverse coordinate. in the notation of [8] it corresponds to
the (6, 12; 3) brane3 predicted by u-duality of m-theory on t 7. in this section
we construct its worldvolume eective action and leave for section 6 and the
conclusions the discussion about its role within the type iia theory.

the action of the m-kk-monopole was constructed in [19, 20] and it is

given by:

3in the notation of [8] the rst entry gives the number of ordinary spatial directions,
the entries of the form mn indicate that there are m spatial directions which are gauged
in the eective action and whose radii have nth power. finally the last entry gives the
power of the inverse of the string coupling constant.

this action reects the fact that the taub-nut space of the monopole is
isometric in its taub-nut direction, so that the transverse space is eectively
three dimensional. the extra degree of freedom is eliminated by imposing a
killing isometry in the taub-nut direction:

(2.4)
which is gauged through the introduction of the dependent gauge eld a 5:

 x  = (0)k  ,

such that kd x  = 0, with d x  the covariant derivative:

a = |k|2 x k ,

d x  =  x  + ak  .

c is the 3-form eld of eleven dimensional

supergravity, c its electric-magnetic dual and n is the dual of the killing
vector k considered as a 1-form. it is therefore a gravitational eld. the
presence of covariant derivatives and contractions with the killing vector
assures invariance under local isometric transformations:  x  = (0)()k .
the eld content is then that of the seven dimensional vector multiplet,
involving 3 scalars and 1 vector. the gauge transformations of the target
space and worldvolume elds involved in the action can be found in [20].

in order to obtain the kk-6a brane eective action we perform a direct
dimensional reduction along a coordinate y dierent from the taub-nut
direction. accordingly, the transverse space of the kk-6a brane still con-
tains an isometric taub-nut direction, which remains gauged in the action
after the reduction. the eld content is again that of the seven dimensional
vector multiplet, taking into account the additional scalar coming from the
reduction.

(2.7)
n (7) is the electric-magnetic dual of the killing vector k, ikn (7) being the
eld to which the iia kk-monopole couples minimally [20]. its gauge trans-
formation rule can be found in that reference. the eld n (8) comes from
the reduction of n, electric-magnetic dual of k, and must be dual to the
modulus of the killing vector (see the conclusions for a discussion on this
point). its gauge transformation rule can be found in the appendix. both
elds are therefore purely gravitational. c (p) denotes a p-form rr eld, b(2)
the ns-ns 2-form and b(6) its electric-magnetic dual. the notation for their
gauge transformation rules is that of [14].

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

where rk is the radius of the compact direction associated to the taub-nut
isometry and ls is the string length.

we nd that the worldvolume eld content is that of the seven dimen-
sional vector multiplet, namely a scalar c(0), a vector d(1) and a 6-form (6)
playing the role of tension of the brane. these elds can be given an inter-
pretation in terms of solitons in the brane. in general, worldvolume elds

9

coupled to a given brane eective action describe soliton solutions in its
worldvolume. for branes with a killing direction, the worldvolume elds
enter in the eld strengths as:

k(p) = p(p1) +

1
2 (ikc (p+1)) + . . . ,

(2.16)

from where we can conclude that (p1) couples to a (p  2)-brane soliton
describing the boundary of a p-brane ending on the monopole, with one of its
worldvolume directions wrapped around the killing direction [14]. therefore
c(0) must couple to a 4-brane soliton (through its worldvolume dual), d(1)
to a 0-brane and a 3-brane solitons, and (6) to a domain-wall soliton. the
corresponding congurations of branes ending on the kk-6a brane can be
associated to some of the intersections of the kk-6a brane with other type
iia branes. these were classied in [21]. we nd:

 the intersections (0|d2, kk6a) and (0|f1, kk6a) are associated to a
0-brane soliton coupled to d(1). these congurations are obtained from
the intersection (0|m2, mkk) in m-theory.

 (3|d4, kk6a) and (3|ns5a, kk6a) are associated to a 3-brane soliton
coupled magnetically to d(1). they are obtained from the conguration
(3|m5, mkk).

 (5|ns5a, kk6a) represents a ns-5a brane embedded in the kk-6a
and it is associated to a domain-wall soliton which couples to (6). it
is obtained from the conguration (5|m5, mkk).

 further, we nd three congurations that can give rise to a 4-brane
soliton. the cases (4|kk6a, kk6a)a and (4|kk5a, kk6a)b couple
magnetically to the embedding scalars and (4|d6, kk6a) couples mag-
netically to the form c(0). the index a (b) indicates that the isometries
of both objects lie in the same (a dierent) direction. these congu-
rations are obtained from the congurations (4|mkk, mkk)a,b in m-
theory through reduction along a transverse direction [21].

3 the iib ns-7 brane

as we have mentioned in the introduction, the ns-7b brane can be obtained
by t-duality from the kk-6a brane. the t-duality transformation takes
place along the taub-nut direction of the kk-6a brane and the result is
the double dimensional reduction of the ns-7b brane. this brane plays a

10

role in the construction of the massive nine dimensional type ii supergravity
of [12], which is manifestly invariant under sl(2, r). this theory contains
three mass parameters, only two of which are independent upon quantization,
and they have their origin in the presence of d7 and ns-7b branes in the
background. also, as we discuss in the end of this section, the orientifold
constructions of the type iib theory on t 2 describing certain branches of
f-theory on k3 require the introduction of ns-7b spacetime lling branes to
cancel the charge of the orientifold xed planes at strong coupling.

3.1 the ns-7b brane eective action

in this section we construct the worldvolume eective action of the ns-7b
brane by performing a t-duality on the kk-6a brane eective action. in
the next subsections we show that it is connected to the d7-brane by an
s-duality transformation and discuss in some extent the role that this brane
plays within the type iib theory.

the result of a t-duality transformation in the eective action of the kk-
6a brane along its taub-nut direction is the (double dimensional reduction
of the) action:

the t-duality transformation rules of the background elds that couple
to the kk-6a brane can be found for instance in [14], whereas the trans-
formation rule of the gravitational eld n (8) has to be worked out, with the
result that it transforms as:

this denes a new eld c (8) in type iib, which as we will discuss below is

this new eld in the iib theory is discussed in the next subsection. (3.1) and
(3.2) also identify the strings that can end on the brane as d-strings, so that
this brane corresponds to the (0,1) 7-brane in the notation of [15].

before comparing with the d7-brane eective action let us analyze the
possible soliton solutions that can occur in the worldvolume of this brane. its
worldvolume eld content consists on c(1) and c(7), playing the role of tension
of the brane, as well as the embedding scalars. they couple to the soliton
congurations:

 (0|d1, ns7b) gives a 0-brane soliton coupled to c(1). it is related to the

conguration (0|d2, kk6a) by t-duality.

 (4|d5, ns7b) gives a 4-brane soliton coupled magnetically to c(1). it is

related by t-duality to (4|d6, kk6a).

12

 (5|ns7b, ns7b) and (5|kk5b, ns7b) give a 5-brane soliton magneti-
cally coupled to the embedding scalars. they are related by t-duality
to (4|kk6a, kk6a)a, and (4|kk5a, kk6a)b, (5|ns5a, kk6a) respec-
tively.

 note that the presence of c(7) as a dynamical tension is not entirely
justied. the existence of such a dynamical tension implies that the
ns-7b brane can be open [22], hence the ns-7b (and by s-duality,
the d7-brane) would have boundaries. however, this would not dene
consistently the monodromies associated to these 7-branes.

3.2 d7-branes, ns7-branes and s-duality

the eective action that we have found for the ns-7b brane is related by
s-duality to the eective action of the d7-brane.

(3.11)

one can check as well that the soliton congurations that we have found
for the ns-7b brane are mapped under s-duality to the usual intersections
involving the d7-brane.

the transformation rules for c (8) and c (8) in (3.10) show that the d7
and ns-7b branes do not form a doublet under s-duality. they imply in
particular that after two s-duality transformations each wz term is mapped
onto itself, whereas for doublets s2 = 1. this observation from the world-
volume eective actions is in agreement with the results of [12], where it is
shown that type iib 7-branes transform as triplets under sl(2,z). we now
elaborate on this point.

consider the conserved currents (in einstein frame) associated to the rr

scalar and dilaton of the type iib theory:

j(0) = e2dc (0)
j() = e2d||2 .

(3.12)

here  = c (0) + ie is the axion-dilaton modulus. these currents dene the
electric-magnetic duals of the rr scalar and dilaton, namely the elds c (8),
to which the d7-brane couples minimally, and a certain 8-form b(8), which
in principle could be associated to another 7-brane in the theory. there is a
third conserved current [12] which can be obtained as a combination of the
previous two with non-constant coecients:

j = c (0)j() + ||2j(0) ,

(3.13)

to which we can associate as well a dual eld. the transformation rules of
these currents under the s and t generators of the sl(2, z) group are [12]:

s :

j(0)  j
j()  j()
j  j(0)

j(0)  j(0)
j()  j() + 2j(0)

t :

j  j  j(0)  j()

(3.14)

14

the transformations of j(0) and j under s suggest that the 8-form associated
to j should be the s-transformed of c (8), namely c (8).
indeed, with this
identication the s-duality transformations of the 8-forms become:

s :

(3.15)

c (8)   c (8)
c (8)  c (8)
b(8)  b(8) ,

which agree with the transformation rules for c (8) and c (8) in (3.10). we
see that a 7-brane magnetically coupled to the dilaton would transform as a
singlet under s-duality, and that the 8-forms c (8) and c (8) do not transform
as a doublet. in fact, the 8-forms transform as a triplet under s-duality, and
in general, under the sl(2, z) symmetry group:

m =   b(8)

2c (8) b(8) !  m1 ,

2 c (8)

  sl(2, z) .

(3.16)

the eld c (8) becomes necessary when we try to map c (8) onto a local
eld under s-duality, but of course the three 8-forms are not independent,
since they are related through (3.13), which in terms of 8-forms reads:

d c (8) = c (0)db(8) + ||2dc (8) .

(3.17)
therefore c (8) is not interpreted as an independent eld in the theory. a
dual type iib supergravity, written as a function of the dual potentials, will
depend only on two of the three 9-form eld strengths6, which is consistent
with the results of [17] and [16]7. this relation only becomes local for constant
axion-dilaton modulus:

c (8) = c (0)b(8) + ||2c (8) .

(3.18)

in order to clarify further the role of this three 8-form potentials let us
consider the solution representing a single d7-brane located at the origin of
the transverse space [12, 23] (in string frame):

6as explained in [16] this formulation will depend as well on the original elds through

the chern-simons forms in the denition of the curvatures.

7in this last reference three dierent 9-form eld strengths appear in the formulation of
type iib supergravity in terms of original and dual elds due to the fact that the action
is manifestly su(1,1) invariant with the u(1) invariance not being xed.

where the harmonic function is given by h =  1

and x1, x2 the two transverse coordinates. the rr charge of this brane can
be computed as:

p = i

dc (8)

(3.20)

where  is a circle around the origin in the transverse space. a 7-brane with
a non-vanishing value for the dilaton carries as well magnetic dilaton charge,
which is computed as:

moreover, through (3.17) it also carries c (8)-charge:

s = i

db(8) .

q = i

d c (8) = i

(c (0) db(8) + ||2 dc (8)).

(3.21)

(3.22)

the values of the three charges can be computed with the only input of the
axion-dilaton modulus associated to the solution. the quantization of the
charges is obtained by imposing that eq with

q =   s

2p

2q s !

(3.23)

belongs to sl(2, z). imposing this condition it is possible to see that the
three charges can be obtained from only two independent integers (see section
5.1 in [12]) whose values specify uniquely the 7-brane charges. it also implies
that it is not possible to have a solution with vanishing p and q charges and
non-vanishing s, which is consistent with the fact that a 7-brane carrying only
magnetic dilaton charge cannot exist, given that (3.21) vanishes for c (0) = 0.
taking into account that 7-branes with the same monodromy matrix are
equivalent, the charge matrix is further restricted to have the form [15]:

  1 1

0 1 ! 1 ,

  sl(2, z) .

(3.24)

if we compute the values of the charges carried by the d7-brane solution

above:

16

p = h e2dc (0) ,
q = h e2(c (0)d||2 + ||2dc (0)) ,
s = h e2d||2 ,

(3.25)

we nd that p = s = 42(log r)2 and q = 1p/3, where we have parametrized
 = rei. therefore asymptotically p and s vanish whereas the q charge tends
to a constant value8. this is consistent with the fact that asymptotically the
string coupling constant vanishes so that we are in a weak coupling regime,
in which c (8) is not well-dened. in the strong coupling limit the solution
that makes sense is the s-dual of the d7-brane solution above, which has the
following form [12]:

ds2 = (h 2 + 2/(2)2)1/2[h 1/2ds2

1,7  h 1/2dd] ,

 = 2i/ log  .

(3.26)

here the harmonic function is given by h =  1
2 log||, as before. this
solution carries as well (p, q, s) charges, which in the einstein frame take the
values: q = s = 42(log r)2, p = (1 + q/3), i.e. they are related to the
charges of the d7-brane solution by the s-duality transformation in (3.14).
in this case it is the p charge the one that has a constant value at innity,
whereas q = s = 0.

let us now clarify the relation between the d7 and ns-7b brane solutions
that we have just considered and the nite energy 7-brane solution of [18]9.
in order to construct a nite energy 7-brane solution, where the modulus 
depends holomorphically on the transverse space, it is crucial to allow  to
have an ambiguity under sl(2, z) transformations [18, 25]. then the solution
is constructed in such a way that the axion-dilaton modulus parametrizes the
fundamental region of sl(2, z), therefore all choices related by an sl(2, z)
transformation have been identied, and there is a one to one mapping from
the fundamental region of sl(2, z) and the complex plane. this is achieved
by fullling the condition (, ) = 0, derived from the equations of motion,
implicitly through the elliptic modular function:

useful in order to study the s-duality properties of the solution.

8in string frame p = s = 1 and q =  1
9we will take however the conventions in [24].

(3.29)

the metric associated to this solution has a decit angle of /6 near  = 0,
so that taking precisely 24 7-branes the plane is curled up into a 2-sphere and
one ends up with a compact manifold. this compactication can equivalently
be described as an elliptically bered k3, with s2 the base of the ber and
 the  parameter of the ber torus. this denes f-theory compactied on
k3, and the 24 7-branes are commonly referred to as f-theory 7-branes [23].
close to  = 0 j has a pole, which must correspond to q = 0, i.e. im 

, in the left hand side of (3.27). near q = 0 j() takes the form:

so that we can determine the precise form of ():

(3.30)

(3.31)

this is the axion-dilaton modulus of the d7-brane solution (3.19).

in order to study the form of the solution at strong coupling we use that
j(1/ ) = j( ) and consider the limit ||  0, so that close to  = 0 j()
behaves as:

j()  e2i/ ,

for   0. therefore near  = 0 we have:
2i

(3.32)

(3.33)

which corresponds to the ns-7b brane solution (3.26). therefore the d7 and
ns-7b brane solutions are just the weak and strong coupling limits of the
non-perturbative 7-brane solution of [18]. we will give further evidence in
section 6 for the fact that they represent the same physical object but in
dierent coordinates patches, where changing the patch amounts to choosing
a dierent region to parametrize the sl(2, z) moduli space.

18

from the point of view of the low energy eective actions we can conclude
that the introduction of three 8-form potentials is necessary when we want
to study the transformation of the d7-brane under sl(2, z), in particular
when trying to map the c (8) eld onto a local potential. the ns-7b brane
eective action that we have constructed should be interpreted as the source
for a 7-brane at strong coupling, where the c (8) eld becomes c (8), which is
non-local in terms of c (8) and b(8). moreover, although b(8) has a meaning
as the electric-magnetic dual of the dilaton, c (8) cannot be considered as an
independent eld in the type iib theory (contributing with one unit to the
counting of the bosonic degrees of freedom) given that it is a function of the
other 8-forms. this gives already an indication that the ns-7b brane should
not have associated a central charge in the type iib spacetime supersym-
metry algebra. we give further evidence to this suggestion in section 6, by
showing that the two solutions are related by a coordinate transformation in
the transverse space which is equivalent to changing the fundamental region
of sl(2, z) by its s-dual. similar observations will also apply for the kk-6a
and kk-8a branes related to the ns-7b brane by t-duality.

3.3 ns-7b branes and orientifold constructions

li89, where f s

there are particular limits of f-theory on k3 for which  remains constant
over the base. in these limits k3 degenerates into a certain orbifold of t 4,
which can be made equivalent to an orientifold of type iib on t 2. the most
clear case is that of f-theory on t 4/z2 [26]. sen showed that in this branch
f-theory is equivalent to type iib on t 2 modded out by the symmetry
(1)f s
l is the spacetime fermion number of the left-movers, 
is the worldsheet parity reversal and i89 is the spacetime inversion in the two
directions of the torus. in this type iib orientifold there are 4 xed-planes
whose charge is cancelled by the addition of 4 d7-branes (plus their mirrors).
open strings ending on these 7-branes provide so(8)4 chan-paton factors,
and this gauge structure coincides with the gauge symmetry of f-theory on
t 4/z2. therefore in this particular branch it is possible to give a description
of the gauge structure of the theory in terms of bps states in weakly coupled
type iib string theory.

the situation is not so simple in other branches, where the symmetry
by which one has to mod out in the type iib description involves non-
perturbative operations [27]. this is what happens in f-theory on t 4/z4,
realized as an orientifold of type iib on t 2 modded by the z4 group generated
by sr(4), where s is the s-duality generator and r(4) rotates /2 in the 8,9
plane. another case is f-theory on t 4/z6, which corresponds to type iib on
t 2/z6, where the group is generated by (st )r(6), where t is the t-generator

19

of sl(2, z) and r(6) rotates /3 in the 8,9 plane. in these limits of f-theory
the orientifold xed planes in the type iib description are non-perturbative
and they require the addition of non-perturbative 7-branes. the analysis of
the singularities on the f-theory side reveals that on the t 4/z4 branch the
gauge structure is e7  e7  so(8), and in t 4/z6, e8  e6  so(8).
the type iib bps states responsible for the gauge symmetries of these
branches have been identied in [28], as well as the way the an gauge groups,
associated to n coinciding branes, are enhanced so as to recover the gauge
group associated to the singularity structure (see also [29]). these bps states
correspond to three dierent types of non-perturbative 7-branes, denoted as
a, b, c, such that for a dn singularity there are anbc 7-branes located at
the singularity, and an1bc 2 for a en singularity. at weak coupling the
bc 7-branes collapse to an orientifold plane o [30] and the gauge group that
emerges is the full so(2n) for a dn singularity and a subgroup so(2(n1))
u(1) for a en, which can be associated to chan-paton factors of fundamental
strings, given that the an branes are d7-branes, located on top of the o
xed plane. therefore for dn singularities the gauge structure is completely
captured perturbatively.
in the strong coupling limit the same reasoning
applies, but now the an branes are ns-7b branes, located on top of the s-
dual orientifold xed planes, and the chan-paton factors are associated to
open d-strings. at intermediate couplings the gauge groups are enhanced,
essentially because it is necessary to consider dierent sheets to describe the
7-branes, and then the same 7-brane can be seen as a dierent brane in
another sheet, so that there can be open strings connecting them through
complicated paths [28] (see [29] for a description in terms of string junctions).

4 the iia kk8-brane

the ns-7b brane predicts the existence of a new brane in type iia which can
be obtained from it by t-duality. this brane is also related to the m9-brane
as follows [8]. the eective action of a single m9-brane contains a gauged
direction in its worldvolume [8, 10] in such a way that the eld content is
that of the nine dimensional vector multiplet. reduction along this gauged
direction gives the d8-brane eective action, whereas the reduction along the
transverse direction gives the action of the ns-9a brane. there is a third
possibility, namely the reduction along a worldvolume direction other than
the killing direction. this gives an 8-brane with a gauged direction in its
worldvolume, inherited from the m9-brane, which we denote as a kk-8a
brane. in the notation of [8] it corresponds to the (7, 13; 3) brane predicted
by u-duality of m-theory on t 8. the presence of this kind of 8-branes in the

20

background is the origin of the mass of the massive type iia supergravity
that is obtained by reducing the massive eleven dimensional supergravity of
[31] along a direction dierent from the killing direction.

as explained in [31] it is necessary to introduce a killing direction in
order to formulate a massive supergravity in eleven dimensions. the theory
is therefore not fully covariant and this is the way the no-go theorem of [32]
is circumvented. the origin of the mass is the presence of m9-branes in the
background, which couple as well to the killing vector in their worldvolumes.
romans massive supergravity [33] is obtained by reducing along the killing
direction, therefore is fully covariant, with the presence of d8-branes in the
background being the origin of the mass [34]. on the other hand, the re-
duction along a direction dierent from the killing direction gives rise to a
non-covariant type iia supergravity, containing a killing vector. the pres-
ence of kk-8a branes in the background is the origin of the mass of this
theory.

massive type ii nine dimensional supergravity is obtained by reducing
romans massive supergravity to nine dimensions, being the presence of d7-
branes in the background the origin of its mass [34]. if instead one reduces
the massive type iia supergravity with killing direction and kk-8a branes
along the killing direction, one gets a massive 9 dim supergravity in which
the mass is induced by the presence of ns-7b branes, t-dual to the kk-8a
branes. this theory is s-dual to the massive nine dimensional supergravity
coming from the reduction of romans massive iia supergravity, given that
from the eleven dimensional point of view one is just interchanging the two
compactied directions. in order to obtain a manifestly sl(2, r) invariant
massive 9 dim supergravity, in which both d7 and ns-7b branes are present
in the background, it is necessary to perform a generalized dimensional re-
duction, as explained in [12].

one way to construct the action of the kk-8a brane is by dimensional
reduction from the m9-brane. however only the kinetic term of the m9-brane
eective action has been constructed in the literature [10, 11]. therefore, in
this section we derive the kk-8a brane eective action by performing a t-
duality transformation in the ns-7b brane. the t-duality takes place along a
transverse direction, which in the dual kk-8a brane plays the role of killing
direction. we interpret this direction as worldvolume because it is the one
inherited from the m9-brane in the double dimensional reduction explained
before.

21

the result is the following eective action:

skk8a = tkk8ar d8 e3|k|3(1 + e2|k|2(ikc (1))2)

(4.1)
the kinetic term is very similar to that of the type iia kk-monopole (see
[20]), although now the factors in front of the square root have dierent
powers. the covariant derivative is the usual one for kk-monopoles:

j +

(2)|k|1e

1+e2|k|2(ikc(1))2k(2)
ij )|

dx  = x  + ak

(4.2)

where k/x  = /z and z is the direction along which we t-dualized
the ns-7b brane. therefore this direction becomes a killing direction after
t-duality. the dependent gauge eld is given, as usual, by: a = |k|2x k.
the eld strengths k(1) and k(2) have the form:

2 (ikb(2)) ,

k(1) = (0)  1
k(2) = 2(1) + 1

2 (ikc (3))  2k(1)(dxc (1)) ,
where (0) and (1) arise from the t-duality transformations10

and we also have

c(1) = (1) , z = (2)(0) ,

(4.4)

(4.5)

f  = k(2) .

(7) is t-dual to c(7) in (3.2) and plays the role of tension of the kk-8a
brane.
finally, the wz term reads:

this last relation denes a new eld n (9) (its gauge transformation rule can
be found in the appendix), which is electric-magnetic dual to the mass pa-
rameter of the massive type iia supergravity that is obtained by reducing
the massive eleven dimensional supergravity of [31] along a direction dierent
from the killing direction (see the conclusions). as we have seen this killing
direction is also present in the worldvolume of the kk-8a brane. the eld

23

content of the kk-8a brane is that of the eight dimensional vector multi-
plet, containing 1 vector eld: (1), and 2 scalars: (0) and the transverse
embedding scalar.

to nish this section let us analyze the soliton solutions in the world-
volume of the kk-8a brane. these can be derived by t-duality from the
congurations involving the ns-7b brane, and also from the congurations
associated to the m9-brane given in [35, 36]:

 the 1-form (1) couples to a 0-brane soliton originated by the cong-
uration (0|d2, kk8a). this is related by t-duality to (0|d1, ns7b)
and by reduction to (1|m2, m9) [35, 36]. this 1-brane soliton is how-
ever realized as a 0-brane soliton in the eective nine dimensional
worldvolume of the m9-brane, given that one of the worldvolume di-
rections of the m2-brane is wrapped around the isometric direction.
reduction along an ordinary worldvolume direction of the m9-brane
gives rise to (0|d2, kk8a). (1) also couples magnetically to a 4-
brane soliton, associated to the congurations (4|ns5a, kk8a) and
(4|d4, kk8a). the conguration (4|ns5a, kk8a) is related by t-
duality to (4|ns5b, ns7b) and is obtained from the conguration
(5|m5, m9), where the m5-brane is wrapped around the killing direc-
tion of the m9-brane. therefore this soliton is realized as a 4-brane
soliton in the nine dimensional worldvolume of the m9-brane. on the
other hand, the conguration (4|d4, kk8a) is related by t-duality to
(4|d5, ns7b) and it is also obtained from (5|m5, m9), with the m5
embedded in the nine dimensional worldvolume of the m9-brane and
the reduction taking place along a common worldvolume direction.

 the 0-form (0) couples magnetically to the 5-brane soliton originated
by the conguration (5|ns5a, kk8a), where the ns-5a brane is em-
bedded in the kk-8a brane. this conguration also arises from the
reduction of (5|m5, m9). it is related by t-duality to (5|kk5b, ns7b).
 the only physical embedding scalar can be associated to the boundary
of a kk-6a brane, where we make coincide the isometries of both, the
kk-6a and the kk-8a branes: (5|kk6a, kk8a). this conguration
arises as the dimensional reduction of (5|mkk, m9) along a direction of
the worldvolume of the m9-brane transversal to the mkk-monopole.

 since the kk-8a brane has the interpretation of an 8-brane in 10 di-
mensions, it is a domain wall, hence it is not expected to have a bound-
ary. thus we do not associate any physical meaning to the 7-form (7).

5 the iib kk7-brane

in this section we present the explicit eective action of an exotic brane with
two killing isometries. this brane is interpreted as a 7-brane in the type
iib theory, and is non-perturbative in the same sense as the branes that
we have discussed previously, since its tension also scales like e3.
it is
related to the kk-6a brane by t-duality along a transverse direction and
to the kk-8a brane by t-duality along a worldvolume direction. this last
connection allows to interpret this brane as the one responsible for the mass of
a massive 9 dimensional type ii supergravity containing a killing direction.
this theory should give rise to an 8 dimensional massive supergravity with
no killing directions.

we construct the worldvolume eective action by performing a t-duality
transformation in the kk-6a brane along a transverse coordinate. the
derivation starting from the kk-8a brane will also be discussed at the end
of the section. the result of these duality transformations is a brane with
6 ordinary spatial directions and two gauged isometries [8, 12], which in
the notation of [8] corresponds to the (6, 12, 13; 3) exotic brane predicted by
u-duality of m-theory on an 8-torus. it has an eective tension:

tkk7b =

r2

1r3
2
s l12
(2)6g3
s

,

(5.1)

where r1, r2 are the radii of the two killing directions. we call this brane
a kk-7b brane, since tracing back the origin of its two killing directions we
nd that one has its origin in the isometry of the mkk monopole, which
is interpreted as a transverse direction, whereas the second killing direction
has its origin in the isometry of the m9-brane, which is associated to a world-
volume direction. therefore, although this brane contains only six ordinary
spatial directions, it is in fact interpreted as a 7-brane.

since the exact worldvolume eective action is rather complicated we have
considered the case b(2) = c (2) = 0. starting with the eective action of
the kk-6a brane we perform a t-duality transformation along a transverse
direction dierent from its taub-nut direction. this direction becomes a
killing direction for the dual brane. denoting h the killing vector associated
to the new isometry the kinetic term in the dual eective action is given by:

skk7b = tkk7br d7 e3|h||k2h2  (k.h)2|

q|det(dix djx g  (2)2|h|2ekt

i mkj + (2)|k2h2  (k.h)2|1/2eg(2)

ij )| .

(5.2)

25

here the covariant derivatives contain the two killing vectors k and h:

dx  = x  + a(1)k + a(2)h ,

and the two dependent gauge vector elds a(1), a(2) are dened as11:

kt mk is the sl(2,r)-invariant combination12:
k(1) (cid:17) e  e2 + c (0) 2 c (0)
k(1) =  (0) .

k(1) = (0) ,

1 !  k(1)

k(1) ! ,

the two scalar elds (0), (0) transform as a doublet under s-duality:

(0)  (0) ,
(0)  (0) ,
and arise in the t-duality transformation as:

y = (2)(0) ,

(5.7)

(5.8)

c(0) = (0) .

note that here y denotes the direction along which the t-duality takes place,
and should not be mistaken with the eleventh direction in section 2. within
m-theory, recalling that c(0) (in the eective action of the kk-6a brane) is
related through rescaling to the eleventh direction, we clearly see that the s-
duality transformation of the two scalars (0), (0) is induced from a modular
transformation in the 2-torus.

g(2) is given by:

g(2) = 2d(1) +

1
2 (ihikc (4)) + 2(2)

(k.h)
h2 (0) (0) ,

(5.9)

and arises after t-duality as:

11in our notation: (k.h) = gkh.
12this combination appeared already in the eective action of the type iib kk-

monopole [14], which behaves as a singlet under s-duality transformations.

the wess-zumino term reads:

h(2) = g(2) .

(5.11)
the new elds n (9), n (8), n (8), arise from the t-duality of the elds n (8),
n (7) in the type iia theory. namely, in our truncation:

(ikn (8))1...7 = (ikihn (9))1...7 + 21(ikihn (7))[1...5(ikihc (4))67] ,
(ikn (8))1...6y = (ihikn (8))1...6 ,

(ikn (7))1...6 = (ihikn (8))1...6 .

their gauge transformation rules can be found in the appendix.

again in the same truncation. the eld n (7) in the type iib theory is
the electric-magnetic dual of the killing vector k considered as a 1-form.
this eld is the one to which the type iib kaluza-klein monopole couples

27

minimally, when k is taken along the taub-nut direction. its gauge trans-
formation rule can be found in [14]. in the action of the kk-7b brane, with
two killing directions, there is another 7-form eld, n (7), electric-magnetic
dual of the second killing vector, h. analogously n (8) and n (8) must be
the electric-magnetic duals of the two scalars k2, h2. the eld n (9) is dual
to a mass parameter, which should be the one of the nine dimensional type
ii massive supergravity with a killing isometry to which this 7-brane gives
mass. (6) is t-dual to (6) in (2.12) and plays the role of tension of the
type iib kk7-brane.

the eective action of the kk-7b brane is manifestly invariant under the

two local isometric transformations generated by k and h:

x  = (1)()k  (2)()h .

(5.14)

it is also easy to check that it is s-duality invariant. the elds n (9), n (7) and
n (7) are s-self-dual whereas n (8), n (8) transform as a doublet. this can be
deduced from their origin in eleven dimensions, where s-duality is realized
as a modular transformation in t 2.

as we have mentioned before the kk-7b brane eective action can be
derived as well from the kk-8a brane, by performing a t-duality transfor-
mation along a worldvolume direction. in this case the t-duality mapping
of the eld strengths goes as follows:

k(2)
ij  2(2) (k.h)
j + e2k(2)
k(1)
i k(1)

k2 k(1)
i k(2)

ij

[i k(2)
j = ekt

j] = g(2)
i mkj .

(5.15)

this connection with the kk-8a brane shows that one of the two killing
directions should be interpreted as a worldvolume direction, given that from
this calculation it is inherited from the worldvolume isometry of the kk-8a
brane.

the worldvolume elds present in the eective action describe soliton
in this case, with two gauged

solutions in the worldvolume of the brane.
isometries, the eld strengths are of the form:

k(p1) = (p  1)(p2) +

1
2 (ihikc (p+1)) + . . .

(5.16)

therefore a (p2)-form in the worldvolume couples to a (p3)-brane soliton
realized as the boundary of a p-brane wrapped around the two compact
directions. we nd the following soliton solutions in the worldvolume of the
kk-7b brane:

28

 the 1-form d(1) couples to a 0-brane soliton originated by a d3-brane
with two of its worldvolume directions wrapped around the killing di-
rections of the kk-7b brane: (0|d3, kk7b). this conguration is a
singlet under s-duality and is related by t-duality to (0|d2, kk6a). a
0-brane soliton can also originate by a (p, q) string wrapped around one
of the killing directions of the kk7b. the (0|d1, kk7b) conguration
is related by t-duality to (0|d2, kk6a), whereas the (0|f1, kk7b) is
related to (0|f1, kk6a). d(1) also couples magnetically to a 3-brane
soliton, realized as a (p, q) 5-brane wrapped around the two killing
directions of the kk7b-brane. these congurations are t-dual to
(3|ns5a, kk6a) and (3|d4, kk6a).

 the eld strengths of the two scalars (0) and (0) involve the projection
with the killing vectors of the 2-forms c (2) and b(2), which we have
not included. accordingly, the doublet ((0), (0)) will couple to the 4-
dimensional boundary of a (p, q) 5-brane which is wrapped around one
of the killing directions. t-duality relates these congurations with
(4|d6, kk6a) and (4|kk5a, kk6a).

 the embedding scalars are, as usual, associated to the boundary of
other type ii kkp branes. however, the branes involved in this case
are some of the exotic branes that we have not considered in this paper
(see the conclusions), so we will omit the explicit congurations.

 we nd as well a domain-wall type of soliton, realized as (5|kk5b, kk7b),

coupled to (6), and t-dual to (5|ns5a, kk6a).

6 m-theory interpretation

in this section we study the kk6a and ns7b branes from the point of view
of the m-theory kaluza-klein monopole solution, from which they can be
derived through reduction and duality13. we are able to show that if one
imposses an extra isometry in this solution then it can be written as a 2-
torus bundle over a two dimensional transverse space and that a modular
transformation in the torus can be undone by a change of coordinates in
the transverse space. this symmetry allows to connect the kk6a with the
d6 brane and the ns7b with the d7 brane. we discuss the consequences
regarding the appearance of these branes in the spacetime supersymmetry
algebras.

13we thank chris hull, who has also considered 7-brane solutions and their relations to

m-theory, for a conversation on this point.

29

our starting point is the mkk-monopole solution, which arises when at

least one direction in spacetime is compact:

ds2

m kk = ds2

6,1 

1
h

(dz + ~v  d~x)2  h(d~x  d~x) .

(6.1)

it represents a 6-brane in a four dimensional transverse space, where z is a
taub-nut isometry direction and the function h is harmonic in the three
dimensional space ~x = (x1, x2, x3) and is related to ~v by ~h = ~ ~v . this
solution is magnetically charged under the kaluza-klein vector ikg, where k
is the killing vector associated to the isometry direction z and g denotes the
spacetime metric.

if we impose an additional isometry in the transverse space of the monopole14

the harmonic function depends only on two of the three transversal coordi-
nates, and we can gauge away two of the three components of the gauge
vector ~v . we make the choice such that h = h(x1, x2) and ~v = (0, 0, v3),
with v3 = v3(x1, x2). the monopole solution takes the form:

ds2

m kk = ds2

6,1 

1
h|dz + (v3 + ih)dx3|2  h(dx2

1 + dx2

2) .

(6.2)

this metric can be interpreted as a torus-bundle over a 2-dimensional base
space:

ds2

m kk = ds2

6,1 

a
2|dz +  (x1, x2)dx3|2  r2(dx2

1 + dx2
2)

(6.3)

where the ber is a 2-torus with real periodic coordinates (z, x3)  (z +
1, x3 + 1), a constant area modulus a, which can be introduced by rescaling
z and x3, and a complex structure  = 1 + i2 = v3 + ih. this denes 
as a holomorphic function on the base space x1 + ix2, or anti-holomorphic in
x2 + ix1. finally, r2 = h is the scale parameter of the base space. therefore
the mkk-monopole solution can be written as the product of two spaces
r6,1  b, where b is the torus-bundle.

the bers have an sl(2, z) symmetry:

 

a + b
c + d

,

  z
x3 !    a b

d !  z

x3 ! .

c

(6.4)

notice that z and x3 are now both isometry directions, z is the taub-nut
coordinate for a modulus  and x3 for a modulus  1.
14this can be achieved by considering an innite array of monopoles [7].

30

the solution (6.3), upon reduction over the torus ber, has two wrapping
modes, the d6-brane and the kk-6a brane. the d6-brane can be obtained
by reducing over the coordinate z (re-absorbing a):

c (1) = 1dx3 .

on the other hand, the kk-6a brane is dened as the reduction over the
coordinate x3. taking z along the m-theory circle, the kk-6a brane solution
is given by [12]:

ds2

kk6a = ( 2

and is such that it is related to the d6-brane solution (6.5) by the transfor-
mation of the ber-modulus:

.

(6.7)

[21]:

d(y2 + iy1) =  d(x2 + ix1) ,

the coordinate transformation in the base space (x1, x2)  (y1, y2), where
(6.8)
yields 2/||2 as a harmonic function in (y1, y2) such that the kk-6a brane
solution takes exactly the same form as the d6-brane. therefore the modular
transformation   1/ relating the two 6-brane solutions is equivalent to
a coordinate transformation in the base space. this transformation connects
two points of the base with bers s-dual to each other and therefore estab-
lishes the equivalence between the two 6-brane solutions. this is the reason
why the d6-brane and the kk-6a brane do not have associated independent
central charges in the type iib spacetime supersymmetry algebra.

in the limit a  0, the mkk-monopole solution (6.3) yields the d7-
brane solution with  =  . considering the compactication with a ber
modulus  1 one obtains the ns-7b brane with  =  1. in particular the
7-brane solutions (3.31) and (3.33) correspond to the following choice of  as
a section of the base space (x1, x2):

d7 =

2i

log(x2  ix1) ,

n s7b =

.

(6.9)

31

they can be written using the parameters of the torus-bundle (6.3). for the
d7-brane we have:

d7 =

the base space becomes the transverse space of the 7-branes upon compact-
ication and the s-duality relation between the two branes can be traced
back to the properties of the mkk-monopole interpreted as a torus-bundle.
namely, as we have seen above, the s-duality mapping is just a gauge sym-
metry in the m-theory solution, in the sense that a coordinate transforma-
tion undoes the eect of the s-duality transformation. thus, a coordinate
transformation in the space transversal to the 7-branes relates both 7-brane
solutions. as for the d6, kk6a brane solutions, this provides an explanation
for the fact that the d7 and the ns-7b branes do not appear as independent
branes in the type iib spacetime supersymmetry algebra.

the nite energy 7-brane solution of [18] is obtained from the monopole

solution (6.3) by taking the modulus of the torus-bundle as:

j( ) =

1

x1 + ix2

,

(6.12)

such that we identify all solutions related by a modular transformation in
the sections. this denes  as a holomorphic function, and yields the d7
(ns7b) brane solution in the weak (strong) coupling limit15.

if we now impose one extra isometry in the harmonic function h, h =
h(x1), it is not possible to eliminate completely the dependence of the metric
(6.3) on the coordinate x2, since according to the relation between h and ~v ,
16. a particular type of this class of congura-
v3 has to be a function of x2
tions has been interpreted in [37] as the compactication of m-theory giving
rise to massive type iia string theory17:

ds2

m kk = ds2

6,1  r2(dx2

1 + dx2
15after a /2 rotation in the base space.
16see [21] for a discussion about this point.
17in this reference this solution was interpreted as an m9-brane. however, we see here

a
h|dz + (mx2 + ih)dx3|2 .

2) 

(6.13)

that it is just a kaluza-klein monopole with one extra isometry.

32

this solution is obtained from (6.3) with the ansatz:  = mx2 + ih(x1). we
have substituted 2 = h to make more clear the connection with the solution
in [37]. the condition ~h = ~  ~v xes h(x1) = m|x1| + const, so that
(6.13) represents a domain-wall at x1 = 0 with two dierent bundles at each
side of the wall.

the limit a  0 yields the scherk-schwarz reduction of the type iib
theory with  =  (x1, x2) as ansatz for the axion-dilaton modulus. taking
the limit r  0 as well, one obtains the t-dual theory, which is massive
type iia string theory. thus in order to obtain a d8-brane solution from
(6.3), one requires a bundle b with monodromy

1 !
  1 m

0

(6.14)

in the zero volume limit a  0, r  0. from the point of view of f-theory,
the scherk-schwarz reduction of type iib is a compactication on the 2-
torus bundle over the circle in the x2 direction (with h depending on the
other transverse direction x1) for xed area a [37].

we know that t-duality along a transverse direction on the d7-brane
gives the d8-brane [34]. this relation is also called massive t-duality and its
precise form is given by the kind of scherk-schwarz reduction that is taken in
the type iib side. this is determined by the monodromy (6.14) of the bundle
b, so that it is possible to perform general scherk-schwarz reductions with
a monodromy matrix spanning the whole sl(2, z) [12]. these are related by
t-duality to dierent massive modications of the type iia theory.

if we perform a t-duality transformation in the direction x2 transversal

to the d7-brane, we obtain a d8-brane solution of the form

ds2

 1
d8 =

(ds2

2 dx2
1 ,
2

(6.15)

 3
e = r1
4
2

,

c (1) = (1  mx2)dx2 .

for the t-duality the harmonic function h must be taken as a function linear
on x1, hence 1 = v3 must be linear in x2. we choose h = m|x1| + const and
v3 = mx2, and therefore c (1) = 0.
similarly, one can consider the t-duality of the ns-7b brane. however,
the metric associated to this solution depends, through the modulus of  , on
the x2 coordinate in which we are performing the t-duality transformation.
therefore we need to use the generalized buscher t-duality rules derived in
[12], which allow to treat this case. the result is the kk-8a brane [12]:

33

ds2

c (1) = 0 .

both solutions, the d8 and the kk-8a branes, can be obtained from the m9-
brane solution of [10]18 by dimensional reduction. we can interpret this m9-
brane as a torus-bundle over the one-dimensional transverse space spanned
by x1:

ds2

m 9 = r

3 ds2

7,1  r 4

3  1

2

|dz +  (x1)dx2|2  r

8

3 dx2
1 ,

(6.17)

with ber-modulus  (x1) = ih(x1) and r2 = h. in this case the area of
the torus is also a function of x1. reducing along z we recover the d8-brane
solution whereas the reduction along x2 gives the kk-8a brane solution. the
relation between this two reductions is an s-transformation of the section  .
analogously to the mkk-monopole solution, this modular transformation
can be undone by a change of coordinates in the transverse space. first, let
us rescale the metric so that ds2

m 9 takes the form:

ds2

m 9 = ds2

7,1 

r2
2 |dz +  dx2|2  r2dx2
1 .

(6.18)

in this form it is clear that the area of the torus a = r2, and therefore it
is a function of x1. the modular transformation 2   1
can be generated
by the change of coordinates:

2

dx1  2dx1 ,

dz   1

2 dz ,

dx2   1

2 dx2 .

(6.19)

we see that in this case it is also necessary to perform a change of coordinates
in the torus metric, due to the dependence of its area on the transverse di-
rection. thus, a coordinate transformation relates the two 8-brane solutions,
from where we can conclude that they represent the same physical object
and therefore should have associated a single central charge in the type iia
spacetime supersymmetry algebra.

notice that in (6.15) the most general solution compatible with ~h =
~  ~v corresponds in fact to v3 = mx2 + c, with c = constant, which gives
a d8-brane with c (1) = c dx2. this is indeed a solution to the massive
iia supergravity, and is related by dimensional reduction to a non-diagonal
m9-brane solution. this non-diagonal m9-brane has the same form as in
(6.17) but with ber-modulus  = c + ih(x1). moreover, it can be obtained

18we take  = 1.

34

from (6.17) by means of a t-transformation of the section, which induces a
constant real part for  . this denes a 1-parameter family of (non-diagonal)
m9-branes interpreted as a torus-bundle over the one dimensional transverse
space. furthermore, it is easy to check that the non-diagonal m9-brane can
be reduced to the usual diagonal one by redening the z coordinate. thus it
is also a solution of the massive 11-dimensional supergravity of [31].

gives rise to a d8-brane with c (1) = c dx2, and to a kk-8a brane:

ds2

kk8a = ( h

c2+h 2 ) 1

e = r1( h

c2+h 2 dx2

2 (ds2

7,1  r2 h
c2+h 2 ) 3
4 ,

c (1) =  c

c2+h 2 ) 1

2 dx2
1 ,

2)  r2( h
c2+h 2 dx2 .

(6.20)

this solution could be obtained as well by applying the massive t-duality
rules of [12] to the ns-7b brane solution (6.11) with 1 = mx2 + c and
it is related to the d8-brane solution with c (1) = c dx2 by an
2 = h.
s-transformation of the section  = c + ih.

7 conclusions

we have constructed the worldvolume eective action associated to the ns-
7b brane and checked that it transforms as an sl(2, z) triplet together with
the d7-brane. the third eld entering in this triplet transformation is the
electric-magnetic dual of the dilaton, which however does not have associ-
ated an independent 7-brane solution: the d7 and ns-7b brane solutions
themselves are the ones carrying charge with respect to this eld. we have
claried why the ns-7b brane does not appear in the type iib spacetime
supersymmetry algebra. from one point of view this brane is charged with
respect to a eld which is a combination of the duals of the axion and dilaton
(with coecients depending as well on the axion and dilaton), and therefore
is not an independent eld in the theory. this function is however non-local
and this is why this eld has to be introduced in the s-duality transformation
rule.

from another point of view we have also shown that the d7 and ns7b
brane solutions and the d6 and kk-6a brane solutions are related by a
coordinate transformation in the two dimensional transverse space which
amounts to choosing a dierent region to parametrize the sl(2, z) moduli
space. this provides further evidence for the fact that both 7-branes and 6-
branes represent the same physical object. a similar kind of transformation

35

relates the d8 and kk-8a brane solutions, in this case in the one dimensional
transverse space.
the relation

d c (8) = c (0)db(8) + ||2dc (8) ,

(7.1)

between the eld to which the ns-7b brane couples minimally and the duals
of the axion and dilaton translates under t-duality into relationships between
the elds to which the kk-6a and kk-8a branes couple minimally and the
c (7), c (9) rr elds of the type iia theory. namely:

d(ikn (8)) = (ikc (1))d(ikb(8))  [(ikc (1))2 + e2k2]dc (7)

(7.2)

and:

d(ikn (9)) = (ikc (1))d(ikb(9))  [(ikc (1))2 + e2k2]d(ikc (9)) .

(7.3)

1...7z = b(8)

the rst expression gives a relation between the eld ikn (8), to which the
kk-6a brane couples minimally, the rr 7-form and the t-dual of b(8), which
we have assumed to be again an 8-form: b(8)
1...7z. this 8-form
in the type iia theory can be given some interpretation in connection to
the m8-brane of [6, 8]. this bps 8-brane solution of m-theory is required
by u-duality of m-theory on t 8, but is however not predicted by the m-
theory spacetime supersymmetry algebra. an 8-brane in m-theory requires
the existence of a 9-form potential to which it couples minimally.
if we
assume that the eleven dimensional background contains an isometry (say
in the direction z), along which we reduce to go to the type iia theory,
this 9-form potential could be the electric-magnetic dual of the component
of the metric gzz. then the 9-form would be interpreted as the dual of the
dilaton at strong coupling. when reducing to ten dimensions it would give
rise to a 9-form and an 8-form, which would have associated an 8-brane and
a 7-brane respectively. the 8-form could be the b(8) eld above and the
9-form the b(9) eld that appears in (7.3), and which comes as well from
the t-duality of the eld b(8) of the type iib theory: b(8)
1...8z.
these two elds can be interpreted in the type iia theory as the dual of
the dilaton, for b(8), and the dual of a mass parameter, for b(9). a 7-brane
and an 8-brane associated to these elds are however not predicted by the
type iia spacetime supersymmetry algebra. it is unclear to us at this point
why this happens. one possibility is that it is the d6, kk6a and d8, kk8a
branes themselves the ones carrying charge with respect to the elds ikb(8)
and b(9) respectively, as happens with the 7-branes and the b(8) eld in the

1...8 = b(9)

36

type iib theory. the two relations (7.2) (7.3) suggest that the elds to which
the kk-6a and the kk-8a branes couple are not independent elds in the
theory, and this would explain why these branes do not appear in the type
iia spacetime supersymmetry algebra. one way to clarify further this issue
would be to analyze the equations of motion associated to the elds involved
in these relations, i.e. the rr 1-form, the dilaton and the k2 eld, to elucidate
which are the independent dual potentials in the theory. we hope to report
progress in this direction in the near future. finally, t-duality in (7.2) also
establishes a relationship between the eld (ikihn (9)) to which the kk-7b
brane couples minimally and ihc (8) (in the truncation b(2) = c (2) = 0). as
before, this could be the reason for the non-occurrence of the kk-7b brane
in the type iib spacetime supersymmetry algebra.

there are other exotic branes required to ll up multiplets of bps states
of m-theory on t d for d  8 which we have not considered in this paper
[6, 7, 8, 9]. some of them are very simply related to the branes that we
have studied, and we have indeed checked that the duality relations that
we mention below hold with the worldvolume eective actions that we have
constructed. for instance t-duality of the kk-6a brane along a worldvolume
direction gives a 5-brane in type iib with two killing isometries, which in
the notation of [8] corresponds to the (5, 22; 3)-brane. this brane forms an
s-duality doublet with the (5, 22; 2)-brane obtained by t-duality of the type
iia kk-monopole along a transverse direction. similarly, t-duality of the
kk-8a brane along the transverse direction gives a 7-brane in type iib
with two killing directions, which in the notation of [8] corresponds to a
(7, 23; 3) brane. this brane forms an s-duality doublet with the (7, 23; 4)
brane obtained from t-duality of the ns-9a brane along a worldvolume
direction [8]. therefore in this case the two killing directions are interpreted
as worldvolume directions, and the brane as a 9-brane.

ns-9a branes seem to play a role in the description of the heterotic
e8  e8 as a non-perturbative orientifold of the type iia theory [3].
in
this description the gauge group arises in the form of chan-paton factors of
(dimensionally reduced) open m2-branes ending on the 8 (+8) m9-branes
which are positioned on top of the two orientifold xed-planes, associated to
the i10m symmetry of m-theory (here i10 is the inversion of the eleventh
direction and m reverses the sign of the three form of eleven dimensional
supergravity). in this description m is interpreted as the worldvolume op-
eration reversing one of the spatial directions of the m2-brane. a t-duality
transformation (along a worldvolume direction) in this construction seems
to indicate that the heterotic so(32) could be obtained as an orientifold of
f-theory on t 2 divided by the symmetry i10,11f , with f = t m t 1 (t
denotes the t-duality transformation). t-duality predicts that the (7, 23; 4)-

37

branes above would be the ones responsible for the gauge structure. it would
be interesting to explore this connection in more detail and see in particular
how the f symmetry could be dened on the f-theory side.

a appendix

in this section we give the gauge transformation rules of the new elds that
couple to the eective actions of the branes considered in the paper. the
notation is that of [14], where the transformation rules of the elds coupled
to dp-branes, ns5-branes and kaluza-klein monopoles can also be found.

 the eld to which the kk-6a brane couples minimally transforms as:

(ikn (8)) = 7n(ik(7))  15(ik )(ikc (3)) + 30(2)(ikc (3))2

20c (3)(ikc (3))(ik(2))  (ikn (7))(0)o .
 the eld ikn (9) coupled to the kk-8a brane transforms as:

(a.1)

38

(ikn (9)) = 8n(ik(8)) + 21(ik(6))h(ikc (3) + 2(ikb(2))(dxc (1))i
+105(ik(4))(ikc (3))h(ikc (3)) + 4(ikb(2))(dxc (1))i

+315(ikc (3))2(ik(2))dxdxb(2)

+ 7!

4 (ikc (3))(ik(2))b(2)(ikb(2))(dxc (1))
(2)hikn (8) + 7(ikn (7))(dxc (1)) + 35dxdxdxc (3)(ikc (3))2
+70(cid:16)2c (3)(ikb(2)) + 3(ikc (3))b(2)(cid:17) (ikc (3))(dxc (1))i (ik)o .

(a.2)

 in the kk-7b brane (ihikn (9)) transforms as:

(ihikn (9)) = 7n(ihik(8)) + 6(ihikn (7))(ihik(3))
15(ih(3))(ihikc (4))2 + 10(ihik(3))(ihc (4))(ihikc (4))o .

(a.3)
this is the correct gauge transformation rule in the truncation b(2) =
c (2) = 0. also, in this truncation:

(ihikn (8)) = 6(ihik(7))

(ihikn (8)) = 6(ihik (7)) .

(a.4)

n (9), n (8), n (8) are now 9- and 8-forms in the type iib theory.
