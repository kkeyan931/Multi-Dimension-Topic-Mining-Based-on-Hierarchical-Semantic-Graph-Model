we review the string representations of abelian-projected su(2)- and su(3)-gauge theories and their application
to the evaluation of bilocal eld strength correlators. the large distance asymptotic behaviours of the latter ones
are shown to be in agreement with the stochastic vacuum model of qcd and existing lattice data.

1. introduction

the explanation and description of the con-
nement phenomenon in gauge theories is known
to be one of the most fundamental challenges of
the modern qft (see e.g. [1]). till now, an an-
alytical description of this phenomenon is best
of all elaborated on in the theories containing
monopole ensembles. those include, in particu-
lar, 3d compact qed [1], where monopoles form
a dilute gas, and qcd-inspired abelian-projected
su (n ) gauge theories [2].
in the latter case,
the dominance of abelian degrees of freedom is
usually realized by assuming that non-abelian
(charged) gauge bosons are heavy and do not
propagate at a long-distance scale.
in partic-
ular by partially xing the gauge, one removes
there as many non-abelian degrees of freedom as
possible, leaving the maximal abelian subgroup
[u (1)]n1 unbroken. the relevant ir degrees of
freedom of the resulting abelian-projected theo-
ries are then described by the eld strengths of
the (n  1) abelian (neutral) gauge bosons sup-
plemented by the same amount of magnetic dirac
strings generated by singular gauge transforma-
tions.
it is further very convenient to reformu-
late these theories by means of a duality transfor-
mation, which leads to a theory of dual abelian

gauge elds interacting with (n  1) patterns
of monopole currents. finally, performing the
summation over the grand canonical ensembles
of such currents by making use of the bardakci-
samuel formula [3], one obtains an equivalent ef-
fective ginzburg-landau type lagrangian for dis-
order magnetic higgs elds. those belong to the
maximal abelian subgroup [u (1)]n1 [4] and de-
scribe the condensates of monopole cooper pairs.
the eective theory described by this lagrangian
allows for the formation of nonvanishing v.e.v.s of
magnetic higgs elds mentioned above and thus
realizes the beautiful dual meissner scenario of
connement proposed many years ago by t hooft
and mandelstam [5].

since connement is usually associated with
the formation of strings (tubes of electric ux
between external quarks) [6],
it seems natural
to seek for the description of this phenomenon
in terms of elementary string excitations. obvi-
ously, the dynamical scheme of a dual supercon-
ductor mentioned above provides us with a very
convenient theoretical
framework for studying
this problem by a derivation of string represen-
tations of the related eective abelian-projected
theories. in fact, due to the multivaluedness of
the phase of the higgs eld, there should arise

singularities in the dual gauge elds, which are
natural to be identied with electric abrikosov-
nielsen-olesen (ano) type strings [7]. moreover,
by virtue of the higgs mechanism, monopole con-
densation leads to the nonvanishing mass of the
dual gauge bosons, which sets the scale of the re-
sulting string tension.

in the present talk, we shall briey review
recent progress achieved in the construction of
string representations of the above mentioned
abelian-projected su (n ) theories. possible con-
sequences of the obtained results for the realis-
tic qcd, based on the so-called stochastic vac-
uum model (svm) [8], will also be discussed. in
our interpretation of this subject in the two sub-
sequent sections, where the su (2)- and su (3)-
cases will be successively considered, we shall fol-
low refs. [9] and [10] (see ref. [11] for an extended
review).

2. su(2)theory

it

as

is commonly argued,

the abelian-
projected su (2)-gluodynamics is just the dual
abelian higgs model (dahm), whose action in
the london limit (i.e. the limit of innitely large
coupling constant  of the magnetic higgs eld)
has the form

ssu(2) =

 2z

d (x())(x  x()).

(2)

here, x()  x() is a vector parametrizing the
world-sheet  with  = (cid:0)1, 2(cid:1) standing for the
2d coordinate. this correspondence eventually
enables one to reformulate the integration over
sings as an integration over x()s. the result-
ing partition function has the form zsu(2) =
(cid:17), where the string ef-
r dx() exp(cid:16)ssu(2)

fective action reads [9]

ssu(2)
str.

=

(y).

k1(m|x  y|)

(3)

here, m = 2g is the mass of the dual gauge
boson generated by the higgs mechanism, and
k1 stands for the modied bessel function. the
reader is referred to the above cited papers for de-
tails of the so-called path-integral duality trans-
formation, which leads to eq. (3).

performing the expansion of the action (3) in
powers of the derivatives w.r.t. as, it has been
shown that the rst two terms of this expansion
are the standard nambu-goto one and the so-
called rigidity term, i.e.

here, f = b  b is the eld strength
tensor of the dual vector potential b, g is the
magnetic coupling constant, and  is the v.e.v.
of the magnetic higgs eld. in the london limit
under study, the radial part of the latter one has
been integrated out, whereas its phase has the
form  = sing + reg, where the multivalued part
sing describes a given electric string congura-
tion, while reg stands for a single-valued uc-
tuation around such a conguration. owing to
the fact that the singularities of the phase of the
magnetic higgs eld occur at the world-sheets of
closed electric ano type strings [7], there exists
a correspondence between sing and string world-
sheets, given by the equation

sing(x) = 2(x) 

here, a = /a, g = det(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)gab(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) with
gab = (ax())(bx()) being the induced
metric tensor of the world-sheet, and t =
abg
(ax()) (bx ()) standing for the extrin-
sic curvature tensor. the coupling constant of
the nambu-goto term (also called string ten-
sion) with the logarithmic accuracy reads  

2 ln
g , while the inverse coupling constant of
the rigidity term (considered rst in ref. [12])
has the form 1
in particular, if ex-

ternal quarks are introduced into the system, the
nambu-goto action yields a linearly rising quark-
antiquark potential vconf (r) = r. notice also

another

important

ref.

investigated in
is the evaluation of the irreducible

its string representation.

this behaviour is very similar to the one observed
in the lattice simulations of qcd in ref. [13].
in particular, one can see that the role of the
so-called correlation length of the vacuum, tg,
at which the cumulant in svm decreases,
is
played in dahm by the inverse mass of the dual
gauge boson, m1. the evaluation of the sec-
ond coecient function parametrizing the cumu-
lant, which stands at the omitted x-dependent
lorentz structure, also matches the existing lat-
tice data [13] with a good accuracy.

3. su(3)theory

the eective abelian-projected theory of the
su (3)-gluodynamics [4]
is also of the dahm
type, albeit with the [u (1)]2 gauge invariance
w.r.t. to the maximal abelian subgroup of the
su (3)-group. in the london limit, the action un-
der study reads

been introduced. these vectors naturally emerge
during the cartan decomposition as the struc-
tural constants in the commutation relations be-
tween the diagonal and (properly redened) non-
diagonal su (3)-generators. besides that, the ac-
tion (6) is assumed to be supplied by the following
constraint imposed on the phases a of magnetic

higgs elds,

a = 0, which is just the reec-

a

tion of the fact that the original su (3) group is
special. next, the relation (2) remains the same,
with the substitution sing  sing
,   a
 ,
  a, and x()  x(a)(). consequently,
there exist three dierent types of electric strings,
among which, however, only two are indepen-
dent of each other owing to the above-mentioned
constraint. performing the path-integral dual-
ity transformation of the theory (6) and inte-
grating out one of the world-sheets (for concrete-
ness, x(3)
 ), we arrive at the desired string repre-
sentation for the partition function, which reads

here, the string eective action has the form [10]

where mb = 6g is the mass of the elds ~b.
one can see that, according to eq. (7), the most
crucial dierence of the string eective theory
corresponding to the abelian-projected su (3)-
gluodynamics w.r.t. the su (2)-case is the pres-
ence of two independent kinds of strings, which
not only self-interact, but also interact with each
other by the exchanges of the massive dual gauge
bosons.

as far as the cumulants of the eld strength

are concerned, only for

in particular, the ir asymp-

two cumulants with the replacement m  mb.

discussions

n. brambilla (university of vienna)

why do you use the london limit? i think that
this limit is appropriate for large transverse dis-
tances from the string, but not for large distances
between an external quark and an antiquark.

d. ebert

the london limit has been used here as a
simplifying assumption leading to innitely thin
strings.
if one includes an external quark-
antiquark pair, this scheme leads to a connement
potential plus a yukawa interaction (arising as a
boundary term). indeed, it would be interesting
to go beyond the london limit in the sense of tak-
ing into account the vanishing of the higgs eld
inside the nite core of strings. this is expected
to yield, besides the usual connement potential,
a coulomb potential instead of the yukawa one.

4. conclusions

the obtained results demonstrate the relevance
of the method of abelian projection and the path-
integral duality transformation to the description
of the conning properties of the su (2)- and
su (3)-gluodynamics. the approach considered
above also provides us with a new eld-theoretical
status of svm and sheds some light on the prob-
lem of nding an adequate string representation
of qcd. finally, it is worth mentioning that the
eld strength correlators in dahm have been also
investigated beyond the london limit in refs. [14]
and [11].
