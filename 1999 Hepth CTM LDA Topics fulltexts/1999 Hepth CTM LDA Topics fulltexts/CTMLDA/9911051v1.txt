we study the vacuum partition functional z [ j ] for a system of closed, bosonic pbranes coupled
to pforms in the limiting case : p + 1 = spacetime dimension. we suggest an extension of the
duality transformation which can be applied to the limiting case even though no dual gauge potential
exists in the conventional sense. the dual action thus obtained describes a currentcurrent, static
interaction within the bulk volume bounded by the d  1brane. guided by these results, we then
construct a general expression for the parent lagrangian that allows for a unied treatment of
pduality, even in the presence of external currents, using a rst order formalism instead of the
bianchi identities. finally, we show how this generalized dualization approach can accommodate
the inclusion of a massive topological term in the parent action of an abelian gauge theory.

i. introduction

recently, within a newly proposed spacetime approach to dualities [1], an interesting new result emerged for the
dual theory of an abelian gauge eld in two dimensions [2]. the novelty of that two dimensional model stems from the
fact that there is no known dual version of it within the conventional pduality approach [3]. the root of the problem
is that a gauge eld in two dimensions corresponds to the limiting value p = d 1, and the usual dualization procedure
is not applicable because the corresponding bianchi identities are undened. 1 as a matter of fact, according to the
conventional method, the dual theory of a pform involves a d  p  2 eld, and this correspondence leads to the
constraint p  d  2. nevertheless, one wonders if there is a way to extend the pduality approach to the case
p = d  1, even though the dual eld theory of the starting matter eld is generally undened. to be sure, in the
absence of interactions, the dual theory of a gauge eld strength of maximum rank d corresponds to a background
eld which is constant over the spacetime manifold. in this narrow sense, one may speak of constanttensor duality
for the free theory in the limiting case. however, in a at spacetime, such a constant can be gauged away on account
of translational invariance, so that the resulting free theory is essentially empty2. it seems clear, therefore, that the
extension of the pduality approach must go beyond the case of a free theory in the limiting case. why would these
limiting cases be of any interest? apart from the recognized importance of dualities in connection with the theory
of extended objects [6], it turns out that such limiting theories have been shown to be of some phenomenological
relevance in relation to the problem of connement [7], [8] and glueball formation [9]. the question arises, then, as to
what happens in the case of an interacting theory, for instance in the simplest case in which a coupling to an external
current is present.
in order to address the above question, let us consider the gauge invariant action for a gauge eld a, of rank p = d  1
interacting with an external current j in a ddimensional minkowski spacetime,

the external current

d) [ x  y() ] dy1  . . .  dyd1

(1)

(2)

may be thought of as originating from the timelike history of a d2brane, and can be viewed as the boundary current
of a ddimensional bulk volume, or  bag . accordingly, the boundary v is parametrized by d  1 coordinates
{ a , a = 1, . . . d  1 }.
gauge invariance of the action requires the current to satisfy the condition

the conservation of the boundary current, in turn, implies that j 1...d1 can be written as the divergence of the bulk
current j :

1 j 1...d1 = 0 .

(3)

where

j 1...d1 ( x ; v )  d j 1 2...d ( x ; v )

j 1 2...d ( x ; v ) zv

dd d [ x  z() ] dz1  . . .  dzd .

(5)

in the case of the extremal theory encoded in the action functional (1), the eld strength f is an antisymmetric
tensor of maximum rank d for which no bianchi identities can be formulated. we propose to circumvent this obstacle
by using the rst order formalism. technically, this means that the dualization procedure should be implemented
using the constraint  [ f  da ] instead of  [ df ] within the path integral approach. in other words, as in the case

1 here p stands for the number of world indices, or rank, of the gauge potential, and d represents the number of spacetime
dimensions. the metric is minkowskian and our signature convention is (  + + + . . . + ).
2in a riemannian spacetime, with non zero curvature, that arbitrary constant cannot be set, in general, equal to zero, and
plays the physical role of a cosmological constant [4]. as a matter of fact, the role of that constant is of paramount importance
in most models of cosmic ination [5].

of electrodynamics in two spacetime dimensions, we impose that the  maxwell tensor  is, in fact, the covariant curl
of the gauge potential. this leads us to the partition functional corresponding to the original action (1),

z[j] = z[0]1z [df ][da] (cid:2) f1...d  [ 1 a2...d ](cid:3) 
 exp(cid:26) i

2 d !z d4x f 1...d f1...d 

ie

(d  1)!z ddx a 1...d1 (x) j 1...d1 ( x ; v )(cid:27) .

(6)

next, we write the diracdelta function in the exponential form with the help of a lagrange multiplier b 1...d (x),

(cid:2) f1...d  [ 1 a2...d ](cid:3) =z [db] exp(cid:26)

i

d !z ddx b1...d (cid:0) f 1...d  [ 1 a2...d ](cid:1)(cid:27) .

from here, the dual partition functional is obtained by integrating out independently both f and a.
first, the path integral (6), being gaussian in f , is easily evaluated, and one nds

2d !z d4x [ f 1...d f 1...d + 2f 1...d b 1...d ](cid:27) =

z [ df ] exp(cid:26) i
= exp(cid:26) i

2d!z d4x b 1...d b 1...d (cid:27) .

(7)

(8)

as for the aintegration, we note that the key feature of the rst order formalism is to introduce the original gauge
potential a linearly into the path integral. in this way, the potential a appears as an additional lagrange multiplier
which, after integration, yields the following condition

z [da] exp(cid:26)

i

(d  1)!z d4x a1...d1 ( 1 b12...d  e j2...d )(cid:27) =

=  [ 1 b12...d  e j2...d ] .

(9)

the eect of the above deltafunction is to restrict the  trajectories in the path integral to the family of classical
eld equation for the dual eld b. in order to extract the physical meaning of the dual theory, it may be helpful to
rewrite the above delta function in terms of the bulk current j, as follows

 [ 1 b12...d  e j2...d ] = ( det 2 )1/2  [ b12...d  b12...d

0

 e j 12...d ] .

(10)

it should be noted that in trading the boundary current for the bulk current in the delta function (10), we have
introduced an arbitrary constant eld b12...d
. as mentioned in the introduction, this arbitrary constant represents
the solution of the homogeneous equation for the beld, and corresponds to a cosmological term in the action.
performing the integration over b with the help of the above deltafunction leads to the following expression of the
dual partition functional,

0

exp { i w [ j ] } = exp(cid:26) i

2  d !z ddx ( b12...d

0

 e j 1...d )2(cid:27) .

(11)

without loss of generality, our discussion can be simplied by resetting the constant b0 to zero, and by choosing the
normalization factor z[0] in such a way to cancel the determinant factor appearing in (10). with such redenitions,
equation (11) represents a direct currentcurrent interaction within the bulk which is dual to the original theory (1)
whose interaction takes place between elements of the boundary through the mediating agency of a (d  1)index
potential.
from the above result, one might be deceived into thinking that there are physical quanta being exchanged between
pbrane elements in this limiting case. however, the truth of the matter is that a (d  1)index potential in d
dimensions does not represent a genuine  radiation  eld, in the sense that there are no propagating degrees of
freedom. as we have emphasized earlier, the eld strength, in this case, merely represents a constant background
disguised as a gauge eld. however, if there are no physical degrees of freedom in the original theory, the same must
be true for the dual theory, and this begs the question: what is the nature of the interaction that we have uncovered
here? in this connection, it is instructive to play the game in reverse, and write the dual partition functional w [ j ]
in terms of the boundary current j. using eq.(5), one nds

exp { i w [ j ] } = exp(cid:26) i

e2

(d  1)!z ddx j1...d1 1

2

j1...d1(cid:27) .

(12)

3

the boundary current j, on the other hand, can be expressed through its hodge dual

j1...d1 = 1...d1 j

so that eq. (12) can be rewritten as follows

exp { i w [ j ] } = exp(cid:26) i

e 2

2 z ddx j 1

2

j(cid:27) .

(13)

(14)

the above expression closely resembles the analogous formula for the interaction between point charges in four
dimensions. however, that analogy is formal. more to the point, the physical content of eq.(14) is exactly analogous
to that of  electrodynamics  in two dimensions. indeed, the four vector j, in the limiting case of d  1branes, has
no transverse, spatial, components. this is due to the conservation property (3) of the original boundary current. in
terms of the hodge dual j, that conservation property implies the following relations

where jl
one can rewrite eq.(14) as follows

i represents the longitudinal component of the spatial part of j. in terms of that longitudinal component

j =  

j0 = 0

i jl
i
2

(15)

(16)

exp { i w [ j ] } = exp(cid:26) i

e 2

2 z ddx ji

l

l(cid:27)

ji

and this equation, in turn, can be rewritten in terms of the original brane current

exp { i w [ j ] } = exp(cid:26) i

e 2

2d! z ddx j02...d1 1

2

j02...d1(cid:27)

(17)

(18)

while the result (18) emphasizes the role of the  zerocomponent  of the brane current, thereby violating manifest
covariance, it has the advantage of describing a static, long range,interaction between surface elements of the boundary.
this is clearly reminiscent of the fact that the original gauge potential a has no propagating degrees of freedom,
much as electromagnetism in two dimensions, and actually represents its generalization for extended objects in
higher dimensions. with hindsight,  electrodynamics in two dimensions  may be reinterpreted as a theory of two
dimensional bags [7].
summing up our discussion so far, we have shown how to extend the pdualization procedure, within a path integral
approach, using a rst order formalism instead of bianchi identities in order to include the limiting case of rank
p = d  1 elds. equation (11) shows that the absence of a dual potential results in a local, (contact) interaction of
the bulk current j in the dual theory, while the original potential a induces a nonlocal, though static, long range
interaction on the boundary. the success of the procedure relies on the fact that it dualizes the eld strength f (a)
to a eld b, which, by itself, is not necessarily the covariant curl of a dual potential. in this sense, even if the dual
eld of the gauge potential a does not exist, one can still construct a dual theory for its eld strength. this would
be impossible using the second order formalism since, in that formalism, it is the gauge potential a that is dualized.
furthermore, it can be seen from eq.(18) that a physically meaningful dual theory exist only in case of an interacting
theory, as anticipated in the introduction. with the above results in hand, we turn now to the following question
that arises naturally from our preceding discussion: can one include the usual formulation of pduality within the
extended dualization procedure outlined above for the limiting theory ? clearly, this would be desirable in order to
have a unied approach to pduality for all values of p.
our purpose in the remaining part of this letter, then, is to show that it is indeed possible to reformulate the whole
pduality approach without using the bianchi identities. the road to a unied formulation starts from the  parent
lagrangian  for a pform a and an external current k (in the case of an interacting theory) coupled to a eld b,
which we later identify as the dual eld. our strategy, then, is to construct the parent lagrangian in such a way that
the dualization procedure is applied to the eld strength rather than the gauge potential a. in this approach, the
procedure will turn out to be equivalent to the rst order formalism. what remains to be seen is that in a nonlimiting
case the new procedure gives the same result as the standard approach based on bianchi identities.
we take the parent lagrangian to be of the form 3

3in the following discussion we have suppressed all indices in order to simplify the notation. thus, the hodge dual of a
(p + 1)form, including the appropriate combinatorial factor, is simply indicated by f 
(p+1)! 1 ...dp1 ...d fdp1 ...d ,

where we have introduced both an  electric brane  current j, a  magnetic brane  current k, and the corresponding
 electric  and  magnetic  charges e and g. the introduction of two distinct currents is designed to reproduce
within our formalism, among other dualitites, also the well known dirac electric/magnetic duality. furthermore, f (a)
is assumed, at the outset, to be the curl of the gauge potential pform a, while the dual eld b is a (d  p  1)form
to be determined in the course of dualization. our procedure, which is encapsulated in the diagram of fig.1 involves

(cid:0)(b(cid:0)ej(cid:3))+bf(cid:3)(a)+gkb
two distinct steps which we discuss separately: lp

i) variation with respect to the b eld in the parent lagrangian yields the equation of motion

b lp = 0  b = f (a) + g k + e j 

which, when inserted back into eq.(19), gives the lagrangian of the interacting theory for the eld a as follows

la = 

1

2(cid:16) f (a) + g(1)(p+1)(dp1)k (cid:17)2

+ e a je + e g k j  .

(20)

(21)

the electric boundary current je, coupled to the gauge potential a, can be expressed, as before, in terms of the
electric bulk current j

je = j.

(22)

inspection of eq. (21) shows that there is a currentcurrent contact term k 2, as well as a mixed term k j . such
contact terms are unavoidable consequences of the dualization procedure, and were noticed for the rst time in ref.
[11]. the mixed contact term k j  seems to be especially relevant since it leads to the dirac charge quantization
condition ref. [12]. their overall importance for our present discussion will become clear at the end of this letter.

next, we redene the eld strength, in order to absorb the magnetic bulk current: ef = f + (1)(p+1)(dp1)k  and

this leads to the simple expression for the lagrangian of the a eld

and to the corresponding eld equation

la = 

1

2 ef 2 + e a je + e g kj 

(23)

while the product of two pforms becomes: a b  1

p! a1 ...p b 1 ...p .

ii) the dual theory is obtained by variation of the parent lagrangian with respect to a,

ef = e je.

a l = 0  f (b) = 0.

(24)

(25)

in all cases for which p  d  2, the above equation of motion , it turns out, has a solution which denes the dual
eld b as the eld strength of a dual potential c, in agreement with the result of the standard approach. this proves
the equivalence of the two procedures for non limiting cases. when eq.(25) is inserted back in the expression (19), one
obtains the dual theory for the eld c coupled to the external magnetic current k, as described by the lagrangian

the above lagrangian leads to the eld equations

lb = 

1
2

( b(c)  e j  )2 + g k b(c).

(26)

(27)

eb = g jm

where, once again, we have used the redenition eb  b  e j . similarly, the magnetic boundary current can be

expressed as jm = k.
as a check on the consistency of our procedure, it seems worth observing that equations (24) and (27) in the case p = 1,
d = 4, reproduce the dirac electric/magnetic duality. furthermore, one can easily check that our procedure reproduces
the well known scalartensor duality between an interacting scalar eld in four dimensions, and an interacting two
index antisymmetric gauge eld. indeed, with the choice p = 0 ( f() =  b(c)  b(c)) and j = 0,
one nds a lagrangian for a scalar eld

l() = 

1

2(cid:0)  + g k 
(cid:1)2

which, in turn, leads to the equation of motion

2  = g k    g f (k)

while the dual eld lagrangian follows from (26)

lc = 

1

2  3!

b(c) b(c) +

g
3!

b(c) k 

which gives the equation of motion

b(c) = g j  g k .

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

along the same lines one can prove that the above procedure gives all known dual interacting theories whose current
free version are described, for example, in ref. [6]. finally, in order to prove the equivalence to the rst order formalism
described previously using the path integral approach, we take the limiting value p = d  1 and k = 0 in eq.(21).
this choice immediately leads to

la = 

1

2  d!

f 2

1...d(a) +

e

(d  1)!

a1...d1 j1...d1 .

(32)

this is the same expression derived from the action functional (1). the dual theory follows instead from eq. (25). as
already mentioned, normally that equation denes b as the eld strength of some potential c, except in the limiting
case where it gives the condition

this is the same constant eld encountered in (10). the dual theory is obtained via eq.(26),

  b = 0  b = const.  b0.

lb = 

1
2

(b0  ej )2

(33)

(34)

which is the same result as in eq. (11) once we identify the hodge duals b1...d
= 1...d b0 and j 1...d = 1...d j .
this shows the asserted equivalence of the path integral and algebraic procedure in the limiting case, thus providing

0

6

us with the non trivial result that the modied pduality procedure is applicable to any interacting theory. as a
matter of fact, we can proceed one step further with our extension of the pduality procedure, and show that the
algebraic procedure includes massive abelian topological theories as well.
in order to substantiate the above statement, we include in the parent lagrangian a massive topological term,
m a f (a), for the a eld. the index structure of such topological terms imposes the following restriction on
the dimensionality of spacetime: d = 2p + 1, showing, as is well known, that topological terms can exist a priori only
in odd dimensions. the addition of the topological term in the parent lagrangian does not aect equation (20), which
is obtained by variation of the lagrangian with respect to the b eld. thus, inserting eq.(20) back into the parent
lagrangian yields the following lagrangian for the massive topological theory for the a eld

la = 

1
2

( f (a) + g k  )2 + m a f (a) .

(35)

here we have kept only the  magnetic  current k for an easier comparison with the results in ref.( [11]). in this
connection, we also note that variation of the topological mass term alone with respect to a gives a term of the form,
m [ 1 + (1)p+1] f (a). this term contributes to the equation of motion only if p = 2k  1, while for p = 2k the
topological term is a total derivative. taking into account the previous restriction to odd p, leads to the number
of dimensions d = 4k  1 quoted in ref.( [11]). in a spacetime with such dimensions, the equation of motion for a
becomes

on the other hand, varying the full parent lagrangian with respect to a, yields the equation of motion for the dual
eld b

ef = 2m f (a) .

(36)

f (b) = 2m f (a)

(37)

which represents an extension of the result (25) for the topological term. it is also worth mentioning that eq. (25)
previously was used to dene the dual eld as the eld strength of the dual potential c, while eq. (37) implies that
b has to be of the same rank as a. inserting eq. (37) into the parent lagrangian leads to the dual lagrangian for
the massive  topological  theory

from which we derive the following equation of motion

lb = 

1
2

b2 + g k b +

1
4m

b f (b)

b = 

1
2m

f (b) + g k .

(38)

(39)

in this way we have shown that the dual version of an interacting, topologically massive, abelian gauge theory
discussed, for instance, in ref.( [10]), is an integral part of the modied pduality approach, thus generalizing the
results reported in ref.( [11]) to arbitrary dimensions d = 4k  1.
we conclude this letter with a remark on a general property of interacting dual theories in regards to external currents.
as it can be seen from eq.(23) the current je which is coupled to the gauge potential a can be expressed in terms
of the bulk current as follows, je = j. on the other hand, in the absence of a magnetic current, one can see from
(26) that the dual potential c couples to another electric current as a consequence of the dualization procedure.

this second current, while implicitly related to j, say eje = f (j), is not necessarily given by the divergence of the

boundary current. hence, a priori those two current are not related to each other in most theories encompassed by
our procedure. however, an exception to the rule is found in the limiting case p = d  1. in such a case, one can
e =  j , where j 
see that the two currents are given by the explicit expressions: j2...d
e which

= 12...d 1 j  and ej

e

represents a zeroform 4. this explicit representation of the two currents leads to the identication ej

shows that, in the limiting case, they are, in fact, related by the operation of hodge duality.

e = j 

4we have chosen the symbol j  for the zeroform to order to match the notation in the parent lagrangian (19). note that
the same reasoning applies to the  magnetic  current k in the absence of an  electric  current j.
