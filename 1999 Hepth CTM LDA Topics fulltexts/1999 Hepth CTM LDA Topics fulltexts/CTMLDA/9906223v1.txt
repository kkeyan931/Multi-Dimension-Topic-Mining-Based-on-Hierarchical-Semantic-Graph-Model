abstract

we generalize the ideas and formalism of two-time physics from particle dynamics to
some specic examples of string and p-brane (p  1) dynamics. the two-time string or p-brane
action can be gauge xed to produce various one-time string or p-brane actions that are dual
to each other under gauge transformations. we discuss the particular gauges that correspond
to tensionless strings and p-branes in at (d-1)+1 spacetime, rigid strings and p-branes in
at (d-1)+1 spacetime, and tensionless strings and p-branes propagating in the adsdn sn
backgrounds.

1 introduction

there exist by now many convincing examples of a remarkable connection between a global
so(d, 2) symmetry (sometimes hidden and non-lineraly realized) in one-time point particle
dynamics and the two-time lorentz so(d, 2) symmetry that is linearly realized in a two-time
action with extra gauge symmetries [1]-[6]. the basic property is that the gauge symmetry
reduces the two-time action to a one-time action, but in many possible gauge equivalent ways3,
thus establishing a duality between various one-time dynamical systems and unifying them
in some sense. the motivation for this approach - called two-time physics - comes from the
algebraic approach to m-theory and its extensions [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] that provide various hints of
hidden two timelike dimensions. there also exist indications that the formalism of two-time
physics is applicable to the full structure of m-theory [12].

the crucial observation of [1]-[6] is that many point particle systems (relativistic massless
and massive particle, non-relativistic massless and massive particle, h-atom, harmonic oscilla-
tor, particle moving in the ads background, etc.) in (d-1)-space and 1-time dimensions can be
understood as dierent gauge choices of a 2-time point particle system endowed with a local
sp(2, r) symmetry and manifestly invariant under the global so(d, 2) symmetry. unlike yang-
mills type gauge theories, the concept of time is gauge dependent in the two-time-physics
formalism (see also general relativity although it has only one gauge dependent timelike di-
mension). therefore the gauge xed lagrangian or hamiltonian (spectrum) describes diverse
systems that would appear unrelated in ordinary 1-time dynamics. however, there are gauge
invariant quantities that can be computed in any one of these systems with identical results
(for example casimir eigenvalues of the so(d, 2) representation). thus such systems display
properties of their unication under a common gauge invariant action.

the particular sp(2, r) symmetry that is gauged in this case is nothing but the familiar
authomorphism of the heisenberg commutation relations in quantum mechanics, or the sym-
plectic group of the one-particle phase space of classical hamiltonian dynamics. one can also
think of the same sp(2, r)  so(1, 2) as the conformal group in one (world-line) dimension.
from this point of view many 0 + 1 quantum gravity systems (relativistic massless and massive
particle, non-relativistic massless and massive particle, etc.) can be viewed as dierent gauge
choices of the same 0 + 1 conformal quantum gravity theory [1].

in some specic instances (like the relativistic massless particle) the action of the global
so(d, 2) can be interpreted as the natural action of the conformal group in d-dimensions. what
is surprising is that the same group has a natural action, even though with a highly non-linear

3note that, unlike yang-mills type gauge theories, the concept of time is gauge dependent in the two-
time-physics formalism (as in e.g. general relativity). therefore the gauge xed lagrangian or hamiltonian
describes diverse systems that would appear unrelated in ordinary 1-time dynamics. however, there are gauge
invariant quantities that are the same in every one of these seemingly unrelated systems, thus displaying their
unied origin.

realization, in many other physical situations (the relativistic massive particle, for example)
[2]. the hamiltonians describing these two dierent physical systems (relativistic massless and
massive particle) are related by a canonical sp(2, r) transformation, which is responsible for
the appearance of the global so(d, 2) invariance of the action describing the relativistic massive
particle. the evolution parameters (times) in the two cases, being canonically conjugate to
the respective hamiltonians, are dierent as well.

one can also interpret the same so(d, 2) as the lorentz group in the space with one extra
spatial and one extra time dimensions. the parameters in the various hamiltonians related by
the local sp(2, r) transformations, appear as moduli (values of elds) in this (d, 2) dimensional
space (e.g. mass of particle, coupling of h-atom, etc.). note that the two-time physics
formalism works both classically and quantum-mechanically [1]-[6]. it turns out that in the
full quantum theory, the sp(2, r) gauge invariant sector is completely described by a unique
representation of the conformal group so(d, 2), which xes the values of the so(d, 2) casimirs.
the same formalism can be generalized to the case of particles with spin n/2 by using
world-line supersymmetry with n supercharges (by replacing sp(2, r) with osp(n|2)) [3] and
to target-space supersymmetry (by generalizing the action of the global so(d, 2) symmetry
to various superconformal groups) [6]. in the latter case, the formalism of two-time physics
sheds new light on the origin of fermionic kappa supersymmetry. this provides an explicit
way for constructing physical models invariant under global superconformal symmetry groups
osp(8/4), su(2, 2/4), osp(8/4) which have usual space-time interpretations in d = 3, 4, 6 [6]
and an expanded space-time interpretation including zero modes of p-brane gauge potentials
in other dimensions [12]. the same approach explicitly establishes the existence of the novel
bosonic counterparts of kappa supersymmetry [12].

in this letter we want to extend the formalism of two-time physics for the case of strings
and p-branes (p  2). we nd a natural action of the global so(d, 2) conformal symmetry in
the case of many classical systems involving bosonic strings and branes in (d  1) + 1 dimen-
sions. the list includes the bosonic null string and branes, the null string moving in the ads
background and the bosonic rigid string and branes. the actions for these systems admit the
extension to the two-time formalism by the addition of gauge degrees of freedom. the new
gauge invariant actions can be gauge xed to many other dual sytems of branes in the same
manner of particle dynamics.

the letter is organized as follows.

in section 2 we briey review the two-time physics
formalism for the case of particle dynamics. then in section 3 we extend this formalism and
discuss tensionless strings and branes by working with conguration space variables only. we
apply this approach in section 4 for the case of tensionless strings and branes moving in the
ads background.
in section 5 we discuss the rigid bosonic strings and branes. finally, we
comment on possible generalizations of the results presented in this letter.

2 basic formalism of two-time physics

we start with a brief summary of the two-time physics formalism for the case of spinless
particle dynamics [1]. the model is an sp(2, r) gauge theory described by the action (the
various forms of the action and their utility will be explained below)

2  p m ). the indices i, j = 1, 2 denote the doublet sp(2, r), they
mentum (x m
are raised and lowered by the antisymmetric levi-civita symbol ij. the covariant derivative
d is dened as

i = ikklx m

the local sp(2, r) acts as x m
l and aij = ikklakj + jkklaik, where ij ( )
is a symmetric matrix containting three gauge parameters. the second form of the action is
obtained after an integration by parts so that only x m
1 appears with derivatives. this allows
the identication of x, p by the canonical procedure, as indicated in the third form of the
action.

the gauge elds a11  k, a12 = a21  a, and a22  e also act as langrange multipliers

for the following three rst class constraints (that form the sp(2, r) algebra)

xi  xj = 0  x 2 = p 2 = x  p = 0,

(7)

as implied by the local sp(2, r) invariance.
it is precisely the solution of these constraints
that require that the global metric m n has a signature with two-time like dimensions. thus,
m n stands for the at metric on a (d, 2) dimensional space-time, which is the only signature
consistent with the equations of motion for the sp(2, r) gauge eld akl, leading to a non-trivial
dynamics that can be consistently quantized. hence the global two-time so(d, 2) is implied by
the local sp(2, r) symmetry. it is possible to extend m n to curved spacetime gm n (x) with
suitable modication of the transformation laws and certain conditions on the metric. likewise,
it is possible to extend the action to include background gauge elds. such generalizations will
be discussed in [13].

the fourth form of the action (4) is obtained by integrating out p m . note that the ordinary
 reparametrization    +  ( ) corresponds to a u(1) subgroup of sp(2, r), with the gauge

3

potential a22 = e and gauge parameter 22 = e ( )  ( ). recalling that sp(2, r) = so (1, 2)
is the conformal group on the worldline, this form of the action can be viewed as a generalization
of 0 + 1 gravity ( -reparametrization) to 0 + 1 conformal gravity. the gauge potentials e, a, k
and parameters 22, 12, 11 are associated with the so(1, 2) generators for local translations,
dilatations and conformal transformations respectively.

the fth form of the action (5) is obtained after integtating by parts the cross term  a

 x and dening k = k  a2
is still invariant under the same sp(2, r) = so (1, 2) local symmetries. the simplest form of
the symmetries are the  reparametrization  ( ) and the local scaling 12   ( )

while x m , e and k are all invariant under the local conformal transformations 11. this is the
simplest form of the action, and it is this form that we will explore below in discussing strings
and p-branes.

i x n
j

all forms of the action (1-5) have an explicit global so(d, 2) invariance, generated by the
lorentz generators lm n = x m p n  x n p m = ijx m
that are gauge invariant. as we
mentioned above, dierent gauge choices lead to dierent 0 + 1 theories of 0 + 1 gravity (the
relativistic massless and massive particles, h-atom, harmonic oscillator, etc.) all of which have
so(d, 2) invariant actions that are directly obtained from (1-5) by gauge xing. since the action
(1-5) and the generators lm n are gauge invariant, the global symmetry so(d, 2) is not lost
by gauge xing. this explains why one should expect a hidden (previously unnoticed) global
symmetry so(d, 2) for each of the 0 + 1 systems that result by gauge xing. note that the
equations of motion, not only the action, of the manifestly so(d, 2) invariant particle system
reduce to the expected equations of motion of the (d 1, 1) gauge xed systems, indicating the
validity of the gauge-xing procedure.

if the system is quantized in a xed gauge the absence of ghosts is evident. the system can
also be quantized covariantly; then the sp(2, r) gauge symmetry is just enough to remove all
negative-norm states (ghosts) introduced by two timelike dimensions so that the resulting
quantum theory is unitary. in the quantum version of the theory the unifying feature of the
system is displayed by the fact that all the gauge xed systems, or the covariantly quantized
system, share the same unitary representation of so(d, 2). for example the quadratic casimir
eigenvalue is c2 (so (d, 2)) = 1  d2/4 for the free massless particle, the h-atom, harmonic
oscillator (in one less dimension), the particle moving on adsdn  sn (any n), etc., and
similarly for all casimir eigenvalues cn (so (d, 2)).

as mentioned before this action has been generalized to particles with spin n/2 (via local
osp(n/2) [3]), to spacetime supersymmetry [6] [12] and to interactions with background elds
[13].

3 extensions to tensionless strings and branes

in this section we want to extend the formalism of two-time physics reviewed in the previous
section for the case of tensionless strings and branes. we do not start from a general formalism
as in the case of particle mechanics (the general formalism which is still being developed will
be given elsewhere). rather, we discuss specic cases, which point toward a more general
formulation. we will work with conguration space variables as in the the last form of the
action (5).

we begin with a string analog of the massless relativistic particle. we rotate the extra
space x 1 and time x 0 dimension into a pair of light-cone-like coordinates x + and x.we
recall that [1]-[6] in this basis m = (+,, ), xing two gauges x + ( ) = 1, p + ( ) = 0,
and solving two constraints x 2 = x  p = 0, gives x = x2/2 after identifying x  = x.
then the action (1-5) reduces to the action for a massless particle in d-dimensions s = r d x2
2e .
this action has a well known global non-linearly realized conformal symmetry so(d, 2) which
is a reection of the so(d, 2) two-time lorentz symmetry of the original gauge invariant action
as as explained in the previous section. this action implies the familiar equations of motion
x = 0 and x2 = 0. the stringy counterpart of the massless particle is the null string [14] in
d-space-time dimensions

{x, x}2 = 0.

the last equation says that the determinant g = det gab of the induced metric gab = ax  bx
2{x, x}2 = 0. the fact that the metric is degenerate implies that the world-
is zero, i.e. g  1
sheet of the string is a null surface. also, the tension of the null string is zero4. we note that
a solution of the equations of motion is given by strings that can be excited purely for left or
purely right movers (keep either + or  ) with the following constraints

physics.

this so(d, 2) conformal symmetry as the two-time lorentz symmetry if we start from an action
that is manifestly so(d, 2) invariant in d + 2 dimensions, but has extra local symmetries, so
that the gauge xed version of such an action reduces to a d-space-time dimensional action
for the null string (10). thus consider the following manifestly so(d, 2) invariant action as a
generalization of the particle action (5)

these generalize the symmetries (8, 9) from particles to strings.

using the local scale invariance we can choose again the gauge x + (, ) = 1. then the
equation of motion for the gauge potential k (which also acts as a lagrange multiplier for the
condition x 2 = 0) can be solved for x = x2/2. plugging back this particular gauge choice
into the so(d, 2) invariant action (14), we immediately get the ordinary null string action in
d-space-time dimensions (10).

one can also examine the equations of motion for the components x +, x and x  to
see that they indeed reduce to the equations of motions of the d-space-time dimensional null
string. thus, the d-space-time dimensional action (10) is a genuine gauge xed version of the
manifestly so(d, 2) invariant action (14)!

from the action (14) are lm n = r 2

the generators of the lorenz transformations in the (d, 2)- dimensional space as derived
0,1 = 0,1x m . it is a
simple matter to check that by using the gauge x + = 1, this reduces to the ordinary generators
of the d-dimensional conformal group (13) as they would be derived from the action (10).

we can immediately extend our discussion to the case of null branes. the manifestly

so(d, 2) invariant action for a null p-brane (p  2) is given by

where det (gab) = am1..mp+1am1...mp+1 with the following denition

am1...mp+1 = a1...ap+1a1x m1...ap+1x mp+1 = {x m1, x m2, ..., x mp+1},

(18)

where now ak denote the world-volume indices. as before, by using the local scale invariance,
and going to the gauge x + = 1, one derives the standard d-space-time dimensional action
for the null p-brane. the equations of motion of the manifestly so(d, 2) invariant tensionless
p-brane reduce in the same gauge to the equations of motion in d-space-time dimensions.

thus we conclude that the physics of both null strings and branes are invariant under
the action of the d-dimensional conformal group so(d, 2) and can be viewed from a (d, 2)-
dimensional point of view.

we have also gained a new perpective for these systems. the action (14) can now be gauge
xed in many ways as in the particle case [1]-[6]. this produces various eld theories in a p + 1
worldvolume with (d  1) + 1 degrees of freedom. since these have have a common origin,
a duality exists between them, which amounts to gauge transformations involving the local
symmetries. we examine one class of such gauges in the next section.

4 tensionless p-branes in adsdnsn backgrounds

in this section we briey discuss a class of gauges for the theory dened by the action (14)
in analogy to the particle case in [5]. we work in the d + 2 dimensional coordinate system
labelled by m = (+,, , i) where the (d  1) + 1 dimensions are divided into two sets: the
rst labelled by  describes (d  n  2) + 1 dimensions including one time, and the second
labelled by i describes n + 1 spacelike dimensions. we choose the gauge that makes the length
of the vector x i (, ~) a constant r independent of , ~, i.e. |x i (, ~)| = r, and then solve the
constraint x 2 = 0. the solution is conveniently parametrized by the two vectors ui (, ~) and
x (, ~)

where in the last line we have used the denition of the the length of the vector u = |u| and the
unit vector i = ui
in n + 1 dimensions that describes the sphere sn. the form of the induced

(23)

therefore this choice of gauge corresponds to a null p-brane propagating in an adsdnsn
background described by the lagrangian density

l =

2e

det(gab).

(24)

this is of interest in the recent literature on the ads/cft duality [15, 17, 16]. our form
shows that the global symmetry is larger than the killing symmetries of the background
so (d  n  1, 2)  so (n + 1); the full symmetry is so(d, 2) which contains more than the
killing symmetries.

the important point is that both the at null p-branes of (10) and the null adss p-branes
for every n, appear as particular gauge choices of the same manifestly so(d, 2) invariant action!
this provides some examples of dual p-brane theories. we expect that the further exploration
of other gauges and dualities would be quite interesting.

5 higher order terms in the lagrangian:

the rigid

string and branes

we can also discuss the presence of higher order terms in the manifestly so(d, 2) invariant
lagrangian we have used in the discussion of the null string. it turns out that the rigid string
[18] naturally appears in this formulation.

first we recall that the action for the rigid string in d-space-time dimensions is given by

[18]

srigid = z d2g(k ib

i satisfy

j = ij, n

i ax = 0,

(27)

where i = 1, ..., (d2). the above action can be rewritten in many ways up to a total derivative
[18]. for example

srigid = z d2g((g)x)2,

where (g)x =  1g a(ggabbx) is the laplacian dened with respect to the induced

metric gab. another rewriting of the same action, which we nd particularly useful for our
purposes, is [18]

(25)

(28)

(29)

srigid = z d2ggabatbt,

8

where t = 1g{x, x}.

now we can easily see that (29) is invariant under the action of the d-dimensional conformal
group so(d, 2). we can directly prove the invariance under dilatations (as originally observed
in [18]) and the special conformal transformations (as recently observed in [19]) for the case of
the action (28), if we recall the results from section 3.

consequently, we can extend the action (29) to a space-time with one extra space and one

extra time dimension to the manifestly so(d, 2) invariant action

sr1 = z d2(cid:20)ggabatm n btm n 

1
2

kx 2(cid:21) ,

(30)

with tm n = 1g{x m , x n} and gab = ax m bx n m n . in other words, we claim that when
(30) is evaluated in the gauge x + = 1, x = x2/2 and x  = x it reduces to the d-space-time
dimensional action (29). the usual conformal transformations are generated again by lm n of
section 3. again lm n are naturally interpreted as lorentz generators in (d,2) -dimensional
space-time.

we can immediately extend this result for the case of rigid branes. the manifestly so(d, 2)

invariant action for a rigid p-brane is

srp = z dp+1(cid:20)ggabatm1..mp+1btm1...mp+1

(31)

(32)

(33)

once again, in the gauge x + = 1, x = x2/2 and x  = x this action reduces to the
d-space-time dimensional action.

obviously the same observations can be made if we consider a linear combination of the
manifestly so(d, 2) invariant classical null string (or brane) and rigid string (or brane) actions
in the same gauge.

it is tempting to speculate (as in [19]) that a supersymmetric version of these tensionless
strings is relevant for the understanding of the dynamics of tensionless strings in 6-space-time
dimensions. to make this speculation more concrete we need to extend our formalism to
target-space supersymmetry, perhaps along the lines of [6, 12].

6 outlook

in this letter we have made a few preliminary steps towards extending the formalism of two-
time physics for the case of string and p-brane (p  2) dynamics. we have found a natural
action of the global so(d, 2) symmetry in the case of several classical systems involving bosonic

9

strings and branes. the list includes the bosonic null string and branes, the null string moving
in the adss background and the bosonic rigid string and branes.

the next natural question is to ask whether we can extend our results to other examples of
string and brane dynamics. for example, in the case of particle dynamics it is possible to obtain
the massive relativistic particle as a gauge choice [5]. is it analogously possible to relate the
dynamics of strings and branes with tension (see footnote 3) to tensionless strings and branes
such that they are all derived from the same two-time physics action? one positive indicator
in this direction is the observation made in [20]: the tension of a bosonic string or brane can
be generated if a kind of bosonic wess-zumino term is added to the action of the tensionless
string. this mechanism has a natural supersymmetric extension. it would be interesting to see
if this mechanism has a counterpart in the formalism of two-time physics.

as we have pointed out in the introduction and in eqs.(1-5), one way to think about
the gauging of the canonical sp(2, r) group in the case of particle dynamics, is to identify
sp(2, r)  so(1, 2) as the conformal group on the world-line (similarly osp(n/2) for confor-
mal supergravity [3]). then various 0+1 (super) quantum gravity systems emerge as gauge xed
versions of the same (super)conformal gravity system with the manifest global so(d, 2) symme-
try. what is the analog of this viewpoint in the case of strings and p-branes? it would be natural
to extend gravity to conformal gravity on the world-sheet (or world p+1-volume). for strings
the world-sheet conformal group is so(2, 2)  so(1, 2)l so(1, 2)r  sp(2, r)l  sp(2, r)r
which is tantalizing. more generally, for a p-brane conformal gravity would correspond to the
gauging of so(p + 1, 2). a general formulation of various string and p-brane models along these
lines, with the aim of obtaining a general description of two-time physics is currently under
study.

finally, it is of crucial importance to consider the space-time supersymmetric extensions of

our results, perhaps by generalizing the novel formalism of [6, 12] to strings and branes.
