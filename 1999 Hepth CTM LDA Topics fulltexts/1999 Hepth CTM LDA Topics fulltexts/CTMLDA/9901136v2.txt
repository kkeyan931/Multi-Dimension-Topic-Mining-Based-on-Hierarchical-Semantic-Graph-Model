abstract

we present new supersymmetric solutions of massive iia supergravity involving
d0-branes, a d8-brane and a string. for the bosonic elds we use a general
ansatz with so(8) symmetry.

1. introduction

since a few years, d-branes [1] are an important ingredient of string theories. they
play a crucial role in the more imaginative of recent developments, such as black hole
entropy counting, m-theory, matrix-theory and the ads/cft correspondence. d-
branes are dened as spacetime defects on which open strings can end. they can also
be found as solutions of the low-energy eective action of the dierent string theories,
i.e. the corresponding supergravity theories.

in [2], it was pointed out that to nd the d8-brane as a supergravity solution,
you have to turn to romans massive iia supergravity [3] [4], in which the mass
of the two form in the supergravity multiplet simultaneously acts as a cosmological
constant. the mass parameter is proportional to the dual of the ten form eld strength
associated to the d8-brane.

in general discussions of intersecting brane-solutions in supergravity theories, the
special features of massive iia were mostly ignored. we study some intersections
explicitly to see in detail how they arise, and specically, we will concentrate on
congurations involving d0-branes, d8-branes and a string.

in section 2 we discuss briey the relevant massive iia sugra. in section 3 we

give our ansatze and explain our method. in section 4 we discuss solutions.

recently, a paper which overlaps partly with ours appeared in the hep-th archive

[5].

2. massive ii sugra

the massive iia d=10 supergravity [2] [3] [4] has the same eld content as ordi-
nary iia supergravity, namely: a metric g, a dilaton , a 2-form b, a three-form c,
a gravitino , and a majorana spinor , but the 2-form is massive and contains the
degrees of freedom of the usual one-form via a generalised higgs-mechanism. since
we consider purely bosonic backgrounds we do not write the fermion terms explicitly
in what follows. as covariant eld strengts, we take:

g = 4 dc + 6m(b)2
h = 3 db,

3. ansatz and method

we concentrate on a supersymmetric conguration involving a d8-brane and a
string perpendicular to it, in the z-direction. we impose the following naive projection
conditions on the variation parameter of supersymmetry:

z = 01234567811 = 

z011 = ,

(6)
(7)

these conditions break 1/4 of supersymmetry. taken together they imply the pro-
jection condition for a d0-brane:

011 = ,

2

(8)

such that it is possible to add d0-branes without further breaking supersymmetry.
for the bosonic elds we take the most general static ansatz with an so(8) symmetry
and vanishing four-form g:

ds2 = k(r, z)2dt2 + l(r, z)2dz2 + m(r, z)2(dr2 + r2d2
7)
 = (r, z)
b = b1 dz  dt + b2 dt  dr + b3 dz  dr
m = piecewise constant,

(9)

it contains as special cases the d8-brane (where k(z) = m(z)), the string solu-
tion (where k(r) = l(r)) and the d0-brane solution (where l(r) = m(r) and r =
r2 + z2). the ramond-ramond two form eld strength associated to the d0 brane
is contained in the massive b-eld, such that our ansatz indeed also applies to the
single d0-brane case. remark that the mass parameter can take dierent values on
either side of a domain wall.

with these ansatze for the projection conditions and bosonic elds, we study the
supersymmetry-variations of the fermionic elds. putting these to zero and studying
also the integrablity conditions on the killing spinor equation, gives conditions on
the bosonic elds, enabling us to eliminate all but two of them 3. we choose to keep

the rst equation (17) follows from setting the variation of the fermionic elds to

explicit expressions for the equations of motion are:

restricted ansatz is used, the bosonic equations of motions are then solved and the supersymmetry-
variations are checked a posteriori.

any solution of these coupled dierential equations is a solution of massive iia
sugra preserving (at least) 1/4 supersymmetry.

4. solutions

although the dierential equations are dicult to solve in general, in specic
cases, they simplify drastically. our analysis covers a lot of cases already discussed
in the literature [2] [5] [8] [10], and contains new solutions.

4.1. h = 0

solving the equation h = 0 (16), and equation (17) demonstrates that only the
at d8-brane and the isolated d0-brane are solutions. you do not nd, for instance,
an isolated d0-brane in a d8-brane background, which you might expect to have the
required symmetry. but that conguration would be inconsistent, as explained in [9].

4.2. b2 = 0

using the b2 equation (14), and the mass equation (17), and then analysing the
equations of motion, we nd that we are left with the following simple dierential
equation:

e2  = h(r) + m z

r(h(r)) = m 2.

adding in the appropriate source term, we nd the following solution:

ds2 = (m z + 1 +

independently, the authors of [5] found this solution in a dierent approach. it is clear
that with the source terms we chose, in the massless case we recover the ordinary
string solution [10]. but the interpretation of the solution with the mass term is not
clear. firstly, we do not see an interpretation for the assymptotic geometry. secondly,

4

the metric components of the z and t coordinate are equal, leading the authors of
[5] to name this solution a massive string solution, but there is no obvious so(1, 1)
symmetry, since the metric components depend on the z-coordinate.

4.3. b1 = 0

an analogous analysis gives:

m = n(r)e

r(n5) = 0

(23)

taking appropriate source terms, and making a simple zcoordinate transformation,
we nd the solution:

the solution assymptotically goes to a at d8-brane [2]. the other building block
in the solution is a harmonic superposition of d0-branes and a string. note that it
does not follow from the ordinary harmonic superposition rules [7]. the two-form b
is split in the last line in a part that reminds of the string solution and an exact part
that can be interpreted as the d0-brane gauge eld c(1).

4.4. m = 0

when m = 0, we get ordinary iia sugra [3] [4]. little analysis yields:

m  n(r)1/6

r(h) + n h,zz = 0
r(n) = 0

c(1) = h1dt

(25)

where e2   n h
2 . this set of dierential equations incorporates the at string so-
lution (h = 1 and n harmonic), the lonely d0-brane solution (n = 1 and h harmonic),
as well as the harmonic superposition of both (h = n). we want to indicate one more
possibility, namely the following solution:

(26)

this solution consists of an eight-dimensional wall of d0-branes and a string perpen-
dicular to it. the behavior of the potential is similar to that of a point charge in one
dimension.

5. conclusions

we considered the problem of nding new supersymmetric sugra solutions pre-
serving 1/4 supersymmetry. starting from a quite general ansatz, corresponding to
a superposition of d0-branes, a string and a d8-brane with so(8) symmetry, we
studied the supersymmetry variations of the fermionic elds and thus simplied the
equations of motion. we cover all cases of combinations of these branes in the lit-
erature. moreover, we discovered some new solutions. one of them reduces in the
massless case to the ordinary fundamental string solution, while the interpretation in
the massive case is unclear. this solution was independently found in [5]. another
solution consists of a harmonic superposition of d0-branes and a string in a d8-brane
background. our system of dierential equations may well contain other non-trivial
congurations with interesting physical interpretations. for instance the phenomenon
of the creation of a string in the d0-d8 brane system [11] could be approached with
our ansatz. moreover it would be interesting to apply the masssive t-duality rules
[2] [12] to our new solutions to gain more insight in their interpretation. we also plan
to study other supergravity congurations with our approach.
