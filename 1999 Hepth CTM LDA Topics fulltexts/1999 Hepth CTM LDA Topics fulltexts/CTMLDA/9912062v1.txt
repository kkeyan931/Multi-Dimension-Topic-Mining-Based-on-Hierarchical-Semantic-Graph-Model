abstract

the analogy between general relativity and monopole physics is pointed

out and the presence of a 3-cocycle which corresponds to a source leads to

discretization of eld momentum. this is analogous to the same phenomena

in monopole physics.

recently many attempts have been made to discretize spacetime, cuto

momentum and hence improve quantum eld theory.

in this telegraphic

note we wish to draw an analogy between general relativity and monopole

physics which leads to the same eect.

recall [1] that in monopole physics the triple commutator of velocity

v = p  ea, where b =   a is given by

hv1, hv2, v3ii + hv2, hv3, v1ii + hv3, hv1, v2ii = e  b .

in the presence of a monopole of strength g located at the origin

e  b = 4ge(r) .

the failure of the jacobi identity signals the occurance of a 3-cocycle which

leads to the quantization of eg.

this can also be viewed in the language of dierential forms as the failure

of the bianchi identity for the curvature f . in the presence of the monopole

it is easily seen that the quantization at eg follows.

the analogy with general relativity [2] is based on the simple observation

that the equation relating curvature and the energy momentum tensor of

matter is

g = t .

as dg = 0 is a consequence of the contracted bianchi identity it follows

that

dt = 0

2

which is the conservation of momentum.

let us for a moment assume that dt 6= 0. this would mathematically

signal the appearance of the 3-cocycle in analogy with the monopole case. in

combination with the laws of quantum physics this would lead to discretiza-

tion of the corresponding charge which is p  = r t d. hence the eld
momentum takes discretized values. hence in analogy with dirac if there

is a source for energy momentum that would lead to discretization of eld

momentum just as the presence of a single monopole would lead to charge

quantization.

the author wishes to thank professor h.s. sharatchandra and professor

g. rajasekaran for discussions. he is grateful to professor n.d. haridass

who taught him modern dierential geometry.
