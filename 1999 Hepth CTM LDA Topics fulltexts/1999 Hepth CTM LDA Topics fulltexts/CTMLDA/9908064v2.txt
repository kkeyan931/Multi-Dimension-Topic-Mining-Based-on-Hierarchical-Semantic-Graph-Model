abstract

we study the eect of a non-vanishing ux for the ns-ns antisymmetric tensor in open-

string orbifolds. as in toroidal models, the total dimension of the chan-paton gauge
group is reduced proportionally to the rank of bab, both on d9 and on d5-branes, while
the mobius amplitude involves some signs that, in the z2 orbifold, allow one to connect
continuously u(n) groups to sp(n)  sp(n) groups on each set of d-branes. in this case,
non-universal couplings between twisted scalars and gauge vectors arise, as demanded

by the generalised green-schwarz mechanism. we also comment on the role of the ns-

ns antisymmetric tensor in a recently proposed type i scenario, where supersymmetry is

broken on the d-branes, while it is preserved in the bulk.

1. introduction

since the initial proposal to identify open strings as parameter space orbifolds of

closed oriented strings [1], much progress has been made in our understanding of the rules

that determine the construction of open-string vacua [2,3,4]. in particular, the role played

by modular invariance for oriented closed strings is played by the tadpole conditions and

by a consistent interpretation of the various amplitudes. indeed, due to lack of modular

invariance, the klein bottle, annulus and mobius amplitudes develop uv divergences that

can be related to tadpoles for unphysical ramond-ramond (r-r) elds [5]. tadpole

conditions, then, ensure that the dangerous uv divergences are cured and, as result, the

total ux of the r-r elds vanishes consistently [6].

a consistent interpretation means that all the amplitudes must provide a coherent

pattern of (space-time) massless and massive excitations in the direct vacuum-channel,

consistent with spin-statistics and, after s or p modular transformations, should describe

a consistent tree-level dynamics of (projected) closed string states bouncing between holes

and/or crosscaps. a precise set of rules has been classied in [2,4], and can be formally

summarised as follows. starting from a torus amplitude

inij j

t =xi,j

that encodes the spectrum of the parent closed string theory, one eectively realizes the

world-sheet parity projection  by adding the klein bottle amplitude

k = 1

2xi

niii .

the restriction to the diagonal combinations nii guarantees a consistent particle interpre-
tation, while an s-modular transformation shows that the transverse-channel amplitude

2

k =xi

involves coecients that are perfect squares and represent one-point functions of closed

elds in the presence of a crosscap.

open unoriented strings correspond to the twisted sector of the world-sheet orbifold

and their relevant contributions to the one-loop partition function are encoded in the

annulus amplitudes

here a respects the rule of perfect squares with, now, bi the one-point function of closed

in this paper we shall apply these general rules to the case of orbifold compactications

in the presence of a quantised ns-ns antisymmetric tensor background.
compactications of the open strings [8] it was shown that, although the corresponding

in toroidal

modes are projected out by , a quantised bab background is still consistent with world-

sheet parity. the main results in [8] were that the size the chan-paton gauge group is

reduced in way that depends on the rank of bab, and that so and sp gauge groups may

be connected by (continuous) wilson lines and sign ambiguities that enforce a proper

normalisation of the mobius amplitude. these results explained the key features of the

gauge groups found in the type-i compactications studied in [2,9]. our main purpose

here is to construct the full amplitudes (at a generic, irrational, point in moduli space

[3,10]), following the rules we have previously summarised, and then to recover some

geometric insights [11] added to the new phenomena discovered in [9] from the constraints

(and freedoms) imposed on the amplitudes. we shall thus give an interpretation to the

appearance of varying numbers of tensor multiplets in the closed sector and we shall be
able to identify the signs present in m with discrete wilson lines.

this paper is organised as follows. in section 2 we review the toroidal compactications

of the type i superstring in the presence of a non-vanishing bab. in section 3 we generalise
this construction, discussing in detail the structure of the various amplitudes for the t 4/z2
orbifold. in section 4 we give a physical interpretation of the results presented in section

3, solving the tadpole conditions and determining the massless excitations for the various

models. we also establish a connection between discrete wilson lines and the signs in
m, and, nally, we comment on the emergence of non-universal couplings between twisted
 for a previous, partial, description of orbifolds with a non-vanishing bab, without a complete
construction of the partition functions, see [7].

scalars and gauge vectors, consistently with the generalised green-schwarz mechanism. in

section 5 we generalise the construction of the open descendants of the z orbifold [12], thus

emphasising the role played by the signs in the mobius amplitude. in section 6 we apply

our results to a recently proposed type i scenario [13], where supersymmetry is broken on

branes but remains unbroken in the bulk. section 7 contains our conclusions.

2. review of generalised toroidal compactications

let us review the compactication of open strings on a d-dimensional torus, studied

for the rst time in [8]. on a generic d-dimensional lattice, the left and right momenta of

the parent closed theory can be expressed as [14]

pa = ma + 1
pa = ma  1

 (gab  bab)nb ,
 (gab + bab)nb ,

(2.1)

where the metric gab and the ns-ns antisymmetric tensor bab describe the size and the
shape of the internal torus. it is evident that, at generic points in moduli space, the parent

theory is no more left-right symmetric. nonetheless, world-sheet symmetry still holds if

one restricts the attention to particular tori, for which eectively pa = pa. as a result,
the combination 2
the antisymmetric tensor is quantised

 bab need be an integer, i.e.

in appropriate units. this is consistent with the fact that, in the open descendants, the

uctuations of the ns-ns two-tensor are projected out of the spectrum, so that only the

moduli of the internal metric can be used to deform the lattice.

once the left-right symmetry of the parent closed string is restored, one can proceed

to construct the open descendants, starting, as usual, with the klein bottle amplitudes

k(tor) = 1

here and in the following, a tilde denotes amplitudes in the transverse channel, and ver-

tical and horizontal proper times are related by an s modular transformation for the

klein bottle and annulus amplitudes and by a p = t

the construction of the open-string sector presents some interesting new features.

following [1,2], the transverse-channel annulus amplitude involves only characters that

fuse into the identity with their anti-holomorphic partners in the closed-string gso. in
our case, this translates in the restriction to states with pa = pa. given the quantisation
condition on the b-eld, only the winding states satisfying

can contribute to the transverse-channel annulus amplitude.

inserting a projector that

eectively realizes (2.2), one gets

complete the -projection in the open-string sector. as is [2], in order to compensate

the xed real part of the modulus of the doubly-covering torus, we have introduced real

hatted characters. notice that the mobius amplitudes involve crucial signs  that
enforce a correct normalisation of the b-eld projector.

the last step in the construction of open descendants consists in imposing the cancel-

lation of tadpoles of unphysical massless states that ow in the transverse channel. this

gives the well known result

n = 25r/2 ,

4

i.e. a non-trivial quantised background for the ns-ns antisymmetric tensor of rank r
reduces the rank of the chan-paton gauge group by a factor 2r/2. in geometrical terms,
the identication b = 1
2 w2, with w2 the generalised second stieel-whitney class, suggests
to interpret the presence of a quantised bab as an obstruction to dene a vector structure
on the compactication torus [15,16,11].

before closing this section, let us comment on the role of the signs  that must be
introduced in the mobius amplitude. to this end, it is convenient to analyse in some detail

the case of a two-torus. the metric gab and the antisymmetric tensor can be conveniently
parametrised as

g =

y2

x2 (cid:18) 1

x1

x1

|x|2(cid:19) ,

b =



2 (cid:18) 0
y1

0 (cid:19) ,

where x and y dene the complex and kahler structures, respectively.

the corresponding annulus amplitudes are

a =

a = 1

2 n 2(v8  s8)(q)

p0,0 + p0,1 + p1,0 + p1,1

2(q)

,

and, in a similar fashion, the mobius amplitudes are

m =  2

2 y2 n ( v8  s8)(i + 1
(cid:2)0,0 + (1)n1 0,1 + (1)n2 1,0 + (1)n1+n2 1,1(cid:3) ,

m =  1

2 n ( v8  s8)(q)

2(q)

.

in these expressions we have introduced a compact notation for the winding and momentum

sums:

wn1,n2 = (e2)

y2
4x2

[(n1+x1n2)2+n2

2x 2

2 x1(m2

2x2 y2

q

[(m1+ 2

1

2 ))2+(m2

1
2 )2x 2

2 ] .

p1,2 = xm1,m2

expanding in powers of q, one can easily nd the contribution of each amplitude to the

tadpole of the r-r 10-form:

k  25 ,
a  25  n 2  4 ,
m  2  n  (0,0 + 0,1 + 1,0 + 1,1) .

5

it is then evident that, in order to solve the tadpole condition, one of the four  has to
equal minus one, while the three others have to equal plus one. among the four possible

choices, only two lead to dierent results and dier in the sign of 0,0. if 0,0 = +1, the
massless vector in the direct channel belongs to the adjoint of an so(16) gauge group,
while if 0,0 = 1 it belongs to a symplectic group.

these signs  are related to the existence of dierent kinds of orientifold planes with
opposite r-r charge [11]. as we shall see in the next sections, a careful construction of

the partition functions reveals neatly their role, and shows that they are also responsible

for similar group transitions in orbifold compactications.

3. the t 4/z2 orbifold with a non-vanishing bab

let us now turn to the compactication on the irrational t 4/z2 orbifold, in the

presence of a non-vanishing background for the ns-ns antisymmetric tensor.

to this end let us introduce the combinations [2]

qo = v4o4  c4c4 ,
qv = o4v4  s4s4 ,

qs = o4c4  s4o4 ,
qc = v4s4  c4v4 ,

of level one so(4) characters, that represent the contributions of the world-sheet fermions
to the partition function. they are eigenstates of the z2 generator, with eigenvalues 1 for
(qo, qs) and (qv , qc), respectively. including the contributions of the internal bosons,
the partition function for the parent type iib superstring then reads:

where we have omitted the integration measure and the contributions of non-compact

bosonic coordinates. in order to extract the massless spectrum and determine the correct

expressions for the direct-channel klein bottle amplitude and the transverse-channel an-

nulus amplitude, one can extract the contributions at the origin from the lattice sums and

rewrite the torus amplitude in terms of generalised characters:

the numerical factor in (3.2) counts the number of points left xed by the action of the

orbifold generator, and thus gives multiplicities to states in the twisted sector. for a z2
orbifold it is equal to 16, as one expects from the lefschetz theorem [17].

expanding the generalised characters to the leading (massless) order in q, one gets

qoo + qv v  v4  2c4 ,
qov + qv o  4o4  2s4 ,

qss + qcc  2o4  s4 ,
qsc + qcs  massive ,

from which one can easily read the spectrum of the z2 orbifold of the type iib superstring.
the untwisted sector comprises the n = (2, 0) supergravity multiplet and ve tensor mul-
tiplets, while the twisted sector comprises 16 more tensor multiplets, one from each xed

point. thus, the full spectrum is anomaly-free and corresponds to the compactication on

a smooth k3.

it has been shown in [7,11] that, in the presence of a quantised bab, not all xed points
have the same -eigenvalue. for instance, for the 2d toroidal compactication of type i
in the presence of a non-trivial background for the antisymmetric tensor, three of the four
xed points have a positive eigenvalue, whereas the fourth one has a negative eigenvalue.
the generalisation to the case of a t 4/z2 orbifold is straightforward and, for a generic bab
with rank r, the number of positive and negative eigenvalues is

n = 23(1  2r/2) .

(3.3)

as we shall see in a moment, this is of crucial importance in order to obtain a consistent

transverse klein bottle amplitude.

in orbifold compactications, states coming from twisted sectors are localised on (in-

variant combinations of) xed points. as a result, in computing the klein-bottle amplitude

k = 1

l0
2 trhc  ql0 q

 the -eigenvalues of the xed points are strictly related to the signs  that we have discussed

in the previous section.

7

one has to combine the action of world-sheet parity on closed-string states with the action

of world-sheet parity on xed points. thus, taking into account (3.3), from (3.2), one can

deduce the following expression for the klein-bottle amplitude restricted to the low-lying

excitations:

k(r)
0  1

2n(qoo + qv v ) + (qov + qv o)+
+ (n+  n) [(qss + qcc ) + (qsc + qcs)]o ,

from which one can immediately read the spectrum of massless excitations. beside the
n = (1, 0) gravitational multiplet coupled to the universal tensor multiplet and four hyper-
multiplets from the untwisted sector, one gets n+ hypermultiplets and n tensor multiplets
from the twisted sector, as a result of the dierent behaviour of the z2 xed points under
, i.e. of the dierent charge of the orientifold planes.

the full klein-bottle amplitude can be computed adding the contributions from mas-
sive states lling a sublattice of the original t 4. due to the z2 orbifolding, both momentum
and winding states contribute to the amplitude. actually, the latter have to satisfy the

constraint (2.2). as a result, one has to introduce a projector in the sum over winding

states, so that the full amplitude reads

the coecient in front of the winding sum ensures the correct normalisation of the gravi-

(3.4)

before turning to the open sector, let us pause for a moment and comment on the action

of the ns-ns antisymmetric tensor on the twisted sector. although it is evident that a

non-vanishing b-ux modies the lattice sum, projecting on suitable winding states that

satisfy (2.2), less obvious is the fact that it alters the structure of the twisted sector, that

does not depend on the moduli dening the size and the shape of the lattice, and a priori

does not know anything about the bab background. still, simply imposing the rule of
perfect squares on the crosscap-to-crosscap reection coecients for closed-string states

one would have discovered that, eectively, bab alters the -projection on the xed points.
in this way, one can easily obtain the correct parametrisation, even without resorting to

a geometrical picture of the orbifold model, an option clearly of interest, for instance, for

asymmetric orbifolds. the same procedure can then be applied to the open-string annulus

and mobius amplitudes that, in the transverse channel, have to satisfy similar constraints.

we can now proceed to the construction of the open descendants, introducing the

open sector. from the torus amplitude (3.2) and from our knowledge of the structure of

the xed points, we can write the contributions of massless states to the annulus amplitude

from this last expression, one can anticipate that states in the twisted sector will have

multiplicities related to the rank of the ns-ns antisymmetric tensor. once more, this

coecients be perfect squares.

to conclude the construction of the open descendants, one has to add the contribution

on bab. this is expected, since in the transverse channel k, a and m must factorise.
there is another very important point to stress. the mobius amplitude involves signs 
and  that give a correct normalisation to the projectors onto states that satisfy (2.2),
similarly to what happens in toroidal compactications. a p modular transformation then

gives the mobius amplitude in the direct channel

4. tadpoles, discrete wilson lines and anomalies

we are now ready to extract the massless contributions to the transverse-channel

amplitudes, and thus to read the tadpoles for the unphysical states. the tadpole conditions

are equivalent to those of the standard z2 orbifold without bab [3,10], aside from the fact
that now the total size of the gauge group is reduced according to the rank of the ns-ns

antisymmetric tensor. one thus gets

we have now all the ingredients needed to extract the spectrum of massless excitations.

we have already described the closed spectrum in the previous section.
it comprises
the n = (1, 0) supergravity multiplet coupled to 1 + n tensor multiplets and 4 + n+
hypermultiplets. in order to extract the massless open spectrum, we expand the amplitudes

(3.6) and (3.7) to lowest order in q, obtaining

for the mobius amplitude.
in order to read the spectrum from the above expressions,
we must still introduce an explicit parametrisation of i and r in terms of chan-paton
multiplicities. it is naturally obtained demanding a consistent particle interpretation of

the physical spectrum, i.e.
imposing that the mobius amplitude symmetrises correctly
the annulus amplitude. it is then evident that the signs 0 and 0 present in m play a
crucial role. in order to respect the reality of the annulus amplitude and the structure
of the transverse channel, they have to coincide, i.e. 0 = 0, and then we are left with
two possibilities: 0 = 0 = +1 and 0 = 0 = 1.
in the former case, the mobius
amplitude contains at the massless level only the untwisted hypermultiplet. as a result,

the gauge group is unitary and one is led to the following parametrisation in terms of

complex chan-paton charges:

in = n + n ,
d = di + di ,
i i

rn = i (n  n ) ,
d = i (di  di) .
ri

this is consistent with the well known result for the t 4/z2 orbifold [3,10] with vanishing
b-eld, for which the signs 0 and 0 are uniquely xed by the tadpole conditions. the
massless spectrum then comprises non-abelian vector multiplets with gauge group

gcp = u(24r/2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)99  u(24r/2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)55

and additional charged hypermultiplets in the representations
2 (a; 1)  2 (1; a)  2r/2 (f ; f ) ,

where f (a) denotes the fundamental (antisymmetric) representation. here and in the

following we have decided to conne all the d5-branes to the same xed point. in general,

however, it is possible to distribute them at dierent xed points or at any generic positions

in the internal manifold, thus breaking the gauge group to a product of unitary and/or

symplectic subgroups. in table 1 we summarise the massless spectra for the various choices

of r = 0, 2, 4.

when r 6= 0, one has the additional choice 0 = 0 = 1. in this case, the mobius
amplitude contains the massless vector with a positive sign, and therefore the contribution
of the annulus amplitude is symmetrised. the gauge groups are thus symplectic, and call
for the following parametrisation in terms of real chan-paton charges:

in = n1 + n2 ,

it is not surprising to realize that all these models had been already discovered in

[2,19], using the rational algorithm. in fact, group lattices naturally involve a non-vanishing

quantised b-eld given explicitly by the adjacency matrix of the associated algebra. in

particular, the z2 models discussed in [2,19] were built starting from a toroidal compact-
ication on the so(4)2 lattice and on the so(8) lattice. the latter has a bab with r = 2
and, indeed, the spectrum of the open descendants associated to the (geometrical) diago-

nal modular invariant partition function is exactly the one reported in table 2. it is quite

surprising, however, to see how the second model is obtained in the rational construction.

actually, it is related to a dierent modular invariant combination of characters for the

same so(8) lattice that, as we have seen, involves naively a rank-two antisymmetric tensor.

 see also [18] for a previous discussion about the appearance of symplectic gauge groups in

the t 4/z2 orbifold.

14

actually, this is true for the geometrical combination of characters corresponding to the

diagonal (or, better, charge-conjugation) modular invariant

|o8|2 + |v8|2 + |s8|2 + |c8|2 ,

while all other non-geometrical choices, as for instance

|o8|2 + |v8|2 + s8 c8 + c8 s8 ,

eectively increase the rank of the bab matrix.

actually, it was shown in [2] that the models in table 1 can also be obtained in the

rational construction. they involve the introduction of discrete wilson lines in the mobius

amplitude, that have the eect to modify the p transformation. in order to illustrate this

phenomenon, let us consider the models with r = 2. in the rational model, the transverse-

channel mobius amplitude is [2]

m = ( qo o4 o4  qv v4 v4) .

since p acts as 1 on ( o4, v4), with 1 the rst pauli matrix, it is evident that the direct-
channel amplitude

m = ( qo o4 o4  qv v4 v4)

calls for symplectic gauge groups. actually, this is not the only possible choice. compatibly

with the supercurrent, one may introduce discrete wislon lines, changing the denition of

the internal characters

o4 = o2 o2  v2 v2  o4 = o2 o2 + v2 v2 ,
v4 = o2 v2 + v2 o2  v 4 = o2 v2  v2 o2 ,

and thus aecting the p transformation, whose action on the primed characters ( o4 , v 4 )
is now represented by the pauli matrix 3. as a result, the new

maps to

m = ( qo o4

o4  qv v 4

v 4 )

m = ( qv o4

o4  qo v 4

v 4 )

and calls for unitary gauge groups. we are thus led to identify the action of discrete wilson

lines for non-zero bab with the signs  and  present in the irrational construction.

15

as a side remark, let us recall how the u(16) u(16) model was originally built in [2].
it originates from the compactication on the so(4)2 lattice, once the residual internal
global so(2)4 symmetry is broken, resorting to eight copies of the ising model. as a

result, all characters become real and contribute to the transverse annulus amplitude, thus

enhancing the overall size of the chan-paton gauge group. at this point, as in the previous

case, the introduction of discrete wilson lines turns each pair of sp gauge groups into a
single unitary group, thus yielding the u(16)  u(16) model.

to close this section, let us comment on the cancellation of the residual anomalies for

these models. as usual, tadpole cancellations guarantee the vanishing of the irreducible
trr4 and trf 4

 terms. however, this is not in general sucient, and some other mechanisms
are required in order to compensate the reducible terms. in d = 10 this is the familiar

green-schwarz mechanism, that involves the universal 2-form present in the spectrum [20].

this mechanism still applies to any compactication with a single 2-form, for instance for
the k3 reduction of the heterotic string, or for the t 4/z2 reduction of the type-i string
with a vanishing background for the ns-ns bab. however, when additional tensor elds
are present (a generic feature of six-dimensional open-string vacua), the cancellation of

gauge and gravitational anomalies requires a generalised green-schwarz mechanism [21].
in fact, for nt tensor multiplets the residual anomaly polynomial takes the form

i8 = xx,y

cr
xcs

yrstrxf 2tryf 2 ,

with the cs a collection of constants and  the minkowski metric for so(1, nt ). accord-
ingly, the eld strengths of the 2-forms include suitable combinations of (yang-mills and

gravitational) chern-simons forms, and the kinetic term for the gauge vectors involves

couplings to the scalars vr in the tensor multiplets:

e1 l   1

2 vrcrztrzf f  ,

with corresponding generic strong-coupling singularities [21] that may be related to the

appearance of tensionless strings [22]. actually, it is not true that the presence of ad-

ditional tensor elds in the spectrum automatically calls for a generalised green-schwarz

 in this expression, for r = s = 0 the indices x and y refer to the contribution of the gravita-
tional term trr2. in these supersymmetric models, the self-dual 2-form present in the gravitational
multiplet remove the residual gravitational and mixed anomalies.

16

1. in this case the residual anomaly polynomial is

from this expression, one can read that, besides the self-dual 2-form present in the super-

(4.1)

gravity multiplet, only the untwisted antiself-dual 2-form is involved in the green-schwarz

mechanism (aside from twisted scalar elds responsible for the cancellation of abelian

anomalies). this has been explicitly checked in [23,24,25] for the r = 0 case, where this

result is expected since only the untwisted tensor multiplet is available. nonetheless, one

can use these results to justify the structure of (4.1) for generic r. in fact, for the case
0 = 0 = +1, the explicit value of the constants c is [23]

c  (n  n ) ,

as can be seen turning on a background magnetic eld. thus, due to the numerical

identication of conjugate charges, there is eectively no coupling between twisted scalars

and vectors and, as a result, only a pair of tensors is involved in the generalised green-
schwarz mechanism. the situation changes drastically for the choice 0 = 0 = 1. in
this case, each u(n ) group splits in two dierent symplectic groups sp(n1) sp(n2), and
the constants c associated to the -th factor in the chan-paton gauge group are now given

by

thus, they do not vanish, as expected from the corresponding expressions for the anomaly

polynomials:

5. the t 6/z3 orbifold with a non-vanishing bab

in this section we want to apply our previous results to the four-dimensional z orb-

ifold, thus generalising [12] (see also [26]). since the orbifold group does not contain any

generator that squares to the identity, it is natural to expect that this construction does

not present any new interesting features. as we shall see, however, this is not the case,

since some subtleties are indeed present in the construction of the mobius amplitude. in

what follows we will use the notation introduced in [12].

the building blocks for the z orbifold are the amplitudes ( = e2i/3, ,  = 0, 1)

the left and right momenta are given explicitly by (2.1), with the metric gab pertaining
to three orthogonal copies of a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, as required by the z3

 here (o2, v2, s2, c2) are level one so(2) characters while m (m = 5, . . . , 6) are the 12
characters of the n = 2 superconformal model with c = 1, equivalent to the rational torus at
radius r = 12.

18

and, together with the torus amplitude, leaves at the massless level the n = 1 supergravity

sector, as well as 27 chiral multiplets from the twisted sectors.

the open-string sector now involves in the transverse-channel the projector on the

are suitable combinations of the chan-paton multiplicities n, m, m. the mobius am-

whose solution requires 0 = +1 and  = +1 ( = 1) for r = 0, 4 (r = 2, 6). in order to
better appreciate the role of the signs  and , let us expand the open-string amplitudes
keeping only the massless contributions. one has

for the mobius amplitude. it is then evident that, in order to have a consistent particle
interpretation, the signs 0 and  are to be the same. therefore, for the z orbifold
one does not have the option to introduce discrete wilson lines for a given bab. they
are uniquely xed by the rank of the ns-ns antisymmetric tensor. some of the gauge

groups of reduced rank in [12] should thus be corrected, according to the following table:

6. comments on brane supersymmetry breaking

to conclude, let us briey comment on the results of [13]. the structure of the ampli-

tudes presented in the previous sections is uniquely xed by the constraints of the under-

lying two-dimensional conformal eld theory and by space-time supersymmetry. this last

requirement, for instance, prevents the introduction of signs in the klein bottle amplitude

that are actually allowed by the crosscap constraint [4]. actually, only one (non-trivial)

choice is compatible with supersymmetry

that results in a model with 9 tensor multiplets, 12 hypermultiplets and no open strings.

20

the nice observation of [13] consists in relaxing the requirement of space-time su-

persymmetry, thus allowing for other consistent solutions of the crosscap constraint. in

particular, they considered the case in which the whole twisted sector is antisymmetrised
in the ns-ns sector and symmetrised in the r-r one, yelding an n = (1, 0) supersym-
metric closed (bulk) spectrum with 17 tensor multiplets and 4 hypermultiplets. the corre-

sponding open spectrum is non-supersymmetric, with non-abelian vectors in the adjoint of
so(16) so(16) sp(16) sp(16) and additional fermions and scalars in (anti)symmetric
and bi-fundamental representations. as a result of supersymmetry breaking, the mobius
amplitude generates a one-loop cosmological constant supported on the d5-branes and,
consequently, a potential for the ns-ns moduli appears. this is precisely the opposite to

what found in previous type i settings, where supersymmetry is spontaneously broken in

the bulk but can still be present on the massless excitations [27], or even on the whole

massive spectrum [28], of suitable branes. in the following we shall study the modications
induced in this model by a non-vanishing antisymmetric tensor bab present in the com-
pactication lattice. for the sake of brevity, we shall only present the various amplitudes,

referring to [13] and to the previous sections for a detailed discussion of the subtleties of

the construction.

from the mobius amplitude. as expected from our general considerations, m involves the
signs  and , that play the same role as in the supersymmetric case.

as in [13], the cancellation of r-r tadpoles xes both the overall size of the chan-
paton gauge group, that in this case, however, is reduced by a factor 2r/2 both on the d9
and d5-branes, and the group breaking pattern. however, the untwisted ns-ns scalars
develop non-vanishing one-point functions, and thus a scalar potential arises.

expanding the annulus and mobius amplitudes to leading order in q, one can easily

appreciate the role of the signs  and  that even in this case must coincide. one has

gcp = so(24r/2)  so(24r/2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)99  sp(24r/2)  sp(24r/2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)55

while the choice 0 = 0 = 1 results in unitary gauge groups both for the d9 and
d5-branes:

as pointed out in [13], the gaugini of the unitary group are not lifted in mass, since

gcp = u(24r/2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)99  u(24r/2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)55

thus, in the open sector supersymmetry is broken explicitly, as a result of dierent
representations assigned to the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom in the 55 sector
and from a ip of chirality of spinors in the mixed 95 sector.

7. conclusions

in this paper we have investigated in some detail the open descendants of the t 4/z2
and t 6/z3 orbifolds in the presence of a non-vanishing background for the ns-ns antisym-
metric tensor, thus generalising the constructions of [8] and of [3,2,9,10,12]. as expected,

24

the total size of the chan-paton gauge group is reduced according to the rank of bab both
on the d9 and on the d5 branes. as already noticed in [11,7], the behaviour of the xed

points under the world-sheet parity  depends on the antisymmetric tensor. as in [2], this

yields varying numbers of tensor multiplets for the z2 case. this is crucial for the correct
interpretation of the amplitudes and is consistent with the constraints of two-dimensional

conformal eld theory in the presence of boundaries and/or crosscaps [4]. moreover, as

in [8], the mobius amplitude involves sign ambiguites that are crucial for the correct in-

terpretation of the amplitudes and, in the z2 orbifold, allow one to connect continously
orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups. these signs are needed to enforce a correct nor-

malisation of the mobius amplitude, and at rational points they reduce to the discrete
wilson lines of [9], that aect the p transformation for m. we have also shown how, in
this case, couplings between twisted scalars and vector elds indeed arise, as demanded

by the generalised green-schwarz mechanism [21]. it would be interesting to extend this

construction to other six and four-dimensional orbifolds and to study the eect of discrete

wilson lines also in these cases.

we have also applied these results to a recently proposed type i scenario, where

supersymmetry is broken on the branes but is unbroken in the bulk [13]. the outcome

is, again, varying numbers of tensor multiplets and gauge groups of reduced rank. in this

case, the signs in the mobius amplitude allow a continous deformation from products of

orthogonal and symplectic groups to products of unitary groups.
