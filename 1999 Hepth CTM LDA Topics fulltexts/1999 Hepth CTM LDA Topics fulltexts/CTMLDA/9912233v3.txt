we carefully investigate the gravitational perturbation of the randall-sundrum (rs) single brane-
world solution [hep-th/9906064], based on a covariant curvature tensor formalism recently developed
by us. using this curvature formalism, it is known that the electric part of the 5-dimensional weyl
tensor, denoted by e
 , gives the leading order correction to the conventional einstein equations
on the brane. we consider the general solution of the perturbation equations for the 5-dimensional
weyl tensor caused by the matter uctuations on the brane. by analyzing its asymptotic behaviour
in the direction of the 5th dimension, we nd the curvature invariant diverges as we approach the
cauchy horizon. however, in the limit of asymptotic future in the vicinity of the cauchy horizon,
the curvature invariant falls o fast enough to render the divergence harmless to the brane-world.
we also obtain the asymptotic behavior of e
 on the brane at spatial innity, assuming the matter
perturbation is localized. we nd it falls o suciently fast and will not aect the conserved
quantities at spatial innity. this indicates strongly that the usual conservation law, such as the
adm energy conservation, holds on the brane as far as asymptotically at spacetimes are concerned.

i. introduction

a recent discovery by randall and sundrum of the exact solution that describes minkowski branes in the 5-
dimensional anti-de sitter space [1,2] has attracted much attention. in particular, in their second paper [2], they
showed that a single minkowski brane solution is possible if the brane has positive tension, and opened up the
possibility of dimensional reduction without compactifying extra dimensions. subsequently, a various aspects of, and
variants of the rs solution have been discussed by many authors. among them are work on non-linear plane-waves
[3], on black strings and black cigars [4,5], on the ads/cft correspondence [6,7], on cosmological solutions [816],
on the stability of the rs solution [17] and on the quantum creation of the brane world [18](see also [19,20])

meanwhile, we formulated a covariant set of equations that describes both the 5-dimensional gravity and the 4-
dimensional gravity on the brane [21]. with z2-symmetry, which is expected to hold from an m -theoretic point of
view [22,23], we found the negative tension brane-world would not be allowed since it would be a world of anti-gravity.

then garriga and tanaka showed that the negative tension brane is a world of a negative brans-dicke parameter at
the linear perturbation order [17].

on the other hand, we found a positive tension brane has the correct sign of gravity, and the equations reduce to
the conventional einstein equations in the low energy limit, provided that the extra term due to the electric part of
the 5-dimensional weyl tensor, e , is negligible [21]. thus it is urgently important to clarify the eect of e to
the brane-world. part of this program was rst done by randall and sundrum themselves [2] and more rigourously
by garriga and tanaka [17], and they showed that the eect is small at large distances from the source. however,
this conclusion was obtained only for static perturbations. furthermore, since they adopted the metric perturbation
formalism, the asymptotic behavior of the curvature perturbations in 5 dimensions as the cauchy horizon is approached
was not straightforward to see.

in this paper, we carefully investigate the rst order perturbation of the rs brane-world in terms of the 5-dimensional
weyl tensor. we focus on the single brane model. we rst briey review our curvature tensor formalism. then we
derive the evolution equation for e , and give an expression for the retarded green function with appropriate
boundary condition on the brane. we recover the result obtained in [2,17] on the brane for static sources. for general
spacetime dependent sources, we evaluate the asymptotic behavior of the weyl tensor. we nd the weyl curvature
invariant diverges as we approach the cauchy horizon. nevertheless, an inspection of the asymptotic behavior as we
approach innite future along near the cauchy horizon, this instability does not aect the brane-world since it innitely
redshifts away. this innite redshift eect was suggested by chamblin and gibbons [3]. then we discuss the energy
conservation on the brane. local energy-momentum conservation is guaranteed by the 4-dimensional covariance.
we nd globally conserved energy exists as well, just as in the conventional einstein gravity, for asymptotically at
spacetimes.

ii. the effective einstein equations on the brane

in this section, we briey review the eective gravitational equations on the brane and the equations for the

5-dimensional weyl tensor which were derived in [21].

we consider a 5-dimensional spacetime with negative vacuum energy but otherwise vacuum,

g = 2

5t ; t = g ,

(1)

and a brane in this spacetime as a xed point of the z2-symmetry. 5 is the 5-dimensional gravitational coupling
constant (2

5 = 8g5). we assume the metric of the form,

ds2 = (nn + q ) dxdx = d2 + qdxdx ,

(2)

where ndx = d is unit normal to the  =constant hypersurfaces, one of which corresponds to the brane, and q is
the induced metric on the  =constant hypersurfaces. then, thanks to the z2-symmetry, the eective 4-dimensional
gravitational equations on the brane take a form that resembles the conventional einstein equations:

where

and c is the 5-dimensional weyl tensor.  is the vacuum energy on the brane and gives the brane tension. 
is the energy-momentum tensor of the matter on the brane. it should be noted that e here is not the one exactly
on the brane (which is proportional to the delta function), but the one that is evaluated by taking the limiting value
to the brane. but for simplicity, we call it e on the brane in the rest of the paper. it can be evaluated from either
side of the brane due to z2-symmetry.

as gn , which corresponds to the 4-dimensional newton constant, has the same sign as , we assume a positive
tension brane to obtain the conventional gravity on the brane. in the case of a two brane model with positive and

2

negative tensions, it has been argued that it is possible to recover the normal gravity if the distance between the two
branes is ne-tuned [17] and if some mechanism to stabilize the distance is introduced [15]. in this paper, however,
we focus on a single brane model and assume  > 0.

the dierence of eq. (3) from the einstein gravity is the presence of  and e on the right-hand side. with 5
and  of a very high energy scale, it is easy to see that  can be safely neglected in the low energy limit. on the
other hand, since e comes from the 5-dimensional weyl tensor, there is no a priori reason to expect that it is small
even in the low energy limit. in fact, in the two-brane model, it is this part that contributes dominantly to recover
einstein gravity on the negative tension brane when the distance between the branes is ne-tuned [17]. we note that
because of the contracted bianchi identities, we have

de = 4

5d ,

(8)

where d is the covariant dierentiation with respect to q. hence, in the low energy limit when we can neglect
 , e is transverse-traceless with respect to q .

the eective gravitational equations on the brane (3) are not closed but one must solve the gravitational eld in

the bulk at the same time. the 5-dimensional equations in the bulk we have to solve are

iii. the first order perturbation around the rs-brane world

in this section, we derive the equations for the rst order perturbation around the rs solution [2]. as we have

noted in the previous section, we focus on the case of a single brane with positive tension.

3

a. the perturbation equations

the background bulk spacetime is taken to be the anti-de sitter spacetime whose metric is

ds2 = d2 + e2/ijdxidxj =

2

z2hdz2 +

1

2 ij dxidxji,

(17)

where  = p6/2

5, z := e/, i = 0, 1, 2, 3 and ij is the metric of the minkowski spacetime, ijdxidxj = dt2+dx

2.
 =  or z =  is the cauchy horizon. the rs solution is obtained by putting a brane on a surface z = z and
glueing two identical copies of the region z  z of the ads [1,2]. since the coordinate z is scale-free, we may set
z = 1 without loss of generality. this solution is obtained from eq. (3) by putting 4 = 0 and  = e = 0.

we now consider the rst order perturbation of the rs solution. we assume  is a small quantity of () and solve

the perturbation linear in . hence, we have

on the brane.

in the rst order of  , the extrinsic curvature k can be written as

(4)g = 8gn   e + o(2)

k = 

1


q + k,

where k is o(). the lie derivative of k with respect to n is just e apart from the signature,

using eq. (19), eq. (12) simplies to

nk = k

k  e = e + o(2).

ne = db() +

2


e + o(2).

on the other hand, eq. (10) reduces to

nb = 2d[e] + o(2).

combining these two equations, we obtain the wave equation for e in 5 dimensions,

where 25 is the 5-dimensional dalembertian. in the coordinates (z, x), this becomes

hn(cid:16)n + k0(cid:17) + d2 +

where 24 is the 4-dimensional dalembertian. substituting eq. (15) to eq. (21), we obtain the boundary condition
of e on the brane,

qd2i.

(25)

in addition to the above, since we have de = o(2) on the brane, and nde = o(2), e is transverse-
traceless with respect to the 4-metric q everywhere in the bulk.

once e is solved, we can integrate eqs. (10) and (11) to obtain b and (4)c . to the rst order, these are

expressed in the coordinates (z, xi) as

zb = 

2
z

[e]

z(z2(4)c) = z[b([)]  b([)]]  2z[b||]

(26)

(27)

the above equations will be used when we evaluate the asymptotic behaviour of the weyl curvature near the cauchy
horizon. to discuss the behaviour near the cauchy horizon, we consider an invariant quantity dened by the 5-
dimensional weyl tensor,

cc = (4)c

(4)c + 6ee + 4bb + o(3).

(28)

b. the retarded green function

the general solution of e can be expressed in terms of the green function satisfying

(25 + 4/2)g(z, x) = 5(z, x).

(29)

as usual, we assume there is no incoming waves from past cauchy horizon. hence we consider the retarded green
function. in addition to this causal boundary condition, we have one more boundary condition at the brane. because
of the boundary condition for e , eq. (25), we must impose the corresponding condition on the green function,

with the green function satisfying this condition, e is given by

z(cid:16) g

z2(cid:17)z=1

= 0.

now let us construct the retarded green function. the general form of a mode function satisfying eq. (23) is

using the mode functions obtained above, the retarded green function is constructed as

where pm = pp2 + m2/2 and nm is a normalization constant. the boundary condition (25) requires that the mode

functions should satisfy (30), which determines bm as

then nm is xed by requiring that the mode functions should be properly normalized with respect to the klein-gordon
norm. this gives

bm = 

j1(m)
n1(m)

.

(34)

(32)

(33)

(35)

(36)

(37)

first let us consider the static case. in this case, the green function is given by the integration of the retarded
green function over the time. then the 4-dimensional part gives rise to the factor emr/. hence the integration with
respect to m is dominated by the contribution of small m, and we obtain

c. static case

where r = |x  x

on the brane the far eld approximation gives

from eq. (32), we obtain the leading order of e as

(38)

(39)

(40)

where we assumed the perfect uid form,  = uu + p (q + uu), for the energy momentum tensor. the result
is consistent with those obtained in refs. [2,17].

for z  1, that is, near the cauchy horizon, the static green function is approximately given by

g(z, x; 1, x

) 

1

42zh1 

3

z(cid:17)2i.
2(cid:16) r

hence we obtain the asymptotic behaviour as

with the help of eqs. (26) and (27), the above gives

e = o(2

r g) = o(z3),

e = o(z5) .

b = o(z5),

(4)c = o(z7).

therefore we have

e e = o(z2), bb = o(z4),

(4)c

(4)c = o(z6),

from which we obtain the estimate,

cc = o(z2).

this means that the perturbation remains regular at the cauchy horizon for the static case.

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

(45)

d. general case

we now turn to the general case of time-dependent sources. we rst note that the 4-dimensional green function,

gm(x, x), can be evaluated exactly as

gm(x, x) =

1
2

(t  t)



s2h(s2)j0(cid:16)m

|s|

 (cid:17)i

(46)

|. inserting this expression to eq. (36), we nd the part that contains
where s2 = (t  t)2  r2 and r = |x  x
the derivative of (s2) (hence is proportional to (s2)) will not contribute. this is because this part of gm becomes
independent of m, hence the integration with respect to m gives (z  1), but z = 1 is outside the domain of denition
of e (recall that e on the brane is actually dened by taking the limit to the brane). thus we have

6

gr(z, x; z, x)|z=1 = 

z2

(t  t)(s2)

n1(m)j0(mz)  j1(m)n0(mz)

n1(m)2 + j1(m)2

j0(cid:16)m

|s|

 (cid:17).

(47)

to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of gr, we may approximate the above integral by assuming m  1. physically
this is because only the high frequency modes (in the 5-dimensional sense) can reach the null innity, which corresponds
to the cauchy horizon in the present case. since z > 1 we can then use the asymptotic form of the bessel functions
except the function j0(m|s|); we keep it as it is since we do not want to restrict the range of s2. thus, we obtain

gr(z, x; z, x)|z=1  

(t  t)(s2)z3/2

2



s2 z 

0

= (t  t)(s2)(s2  2(z  1)2)

on the brane (z = 1 + 0), the green function becomes

 (cid:17)
22[s2  2(z  1)2]3/2 .

z3/2

gr(1, x; 1, x) 

(s2)(t  t)

22s3

,

which is in accordance with a naive expectation. this implies the behaviour of e in the far-eld region as

e  o(2

s gr) = o(s5).

(48)

(49)

(50)

this should be compared with the energy momentum tensor of a radiative eld,   s2 at null innity. thus we
conclude that e cannot carry away the energy momentum from a system to innity. we will come back to this
point in the next section.

to investigate the asymptotic behavior near the cauchy horizon, it is more convenient to work in the null coordi-

nates, u = s  (z  1) and v = s + (z + 1). then with the help of eqs. (26) and (27), we nd

e = o(2

b = o(e ) = o(3

s gr) = o(cid:16) (v  u)3/2
(vu)5/2 (cid:17),
s gr) = o(cid:16) (v + u)(v  u)3/2
s gr) = o(cid:16) (v  u)3/2
(vu)7/2 (cid:17).

(vu)7/2

(4)c = o(b ) = o(4

(cid:17),

(51)

we take the limit v   along u =constant to approach the cauchy horizon. then e = o(v1), b = o(v1)
and (4)c = o(v2). therefore, the curvature invariant (28) diverges in this limit as

cc = o(v4).

(52)

this means that the cauchy horizon is unstable to the perturbation. the bad behaviour of the weyl tensor, however,
does not necessarily imply an instability of the brane-world. it will not aect the brane if the divergence disappears
in the limit of distant future; u = v   ( =const.< 1). this is the innite redshift eect. in the present case,
if we take this limit, we nd cc = o(u3). hence the brane-world is unaected by the instability of the
cauchy horizon.

iv. the energy conservation on the brane

in the conventional einstein gravity, the adm energy is conserved if the energy-momentum tensor  decays faster
than  r3 towards spatial innity. for the matter source of compact support, this condition is trivially satised
[2426]. in the present case, we have e which is a part of the 5-dimensional weyl curvature, in addition to the
matter energy-momentum tensor. however, as we have seen in the previous section, although the 4-geometry on the
brane is aected by e , the eect seems to be quite subtle: first, e itself is locally conserved at the linear order,
independent of  . second, both the static and dynamic perturbations fall o suciently rapidly at large distances
from the source. so we expect that the conservation of the total energy holds also in the brane-world, provided the
brane geometry is asymptotically at.

7

to re-conrm this expectation, in this section we present a more detailed discussion of the energy conservation. a
brief review of the asymptotic structure at spatial innity is given in appendix a. the following argument is based
on a recently developed formalism of the conformal innity [25,26], which is much easier to deal with than the old
formalism [24].

first we express the asymptotic behavior of the 4-dimensional ricci tensor as

l = (4)r 

1
6

q

(4)r  l(0)

 + l(1)

 r1 + l(2)

 r2 + l(3)

 r3 + o(cid:16) 1
r4(cid:17).

(53)

the total energy of a system is naturally dened by the electric part of the 4-dimensional weyl tensor, (4)e =
(4)crr , because it is the one that describes the tidal force. r is the unit vector of the radial direction. by
a conformal transformation, one can expand the spatial innity to introduce the structure of a unit 3-dimensional
timelike hyperboloid. we denote the metric and the covariant derivative of it by p and d, respectively. then,
assuming l(0)

 = 0, the leading order behavior of (4)e for r   can be expressed as

 = l(1)

 = l(2)

(4)e

(dd + p )f (1) 

1
2

(l(3)

 + pl(3)

 rr)i + o(cid:16) 1
r2(cid:17),

(54)

where f (1) is a function on the unit 3-dimensional timelike hyperboloid. in the present case, we have contributions
from not only  but also e to the ricci tensor. from the analysis in the previous section at the spatial innity,
e = o(r5). hence, if the matter source is localized, we have l(n)

 = 0 for n = 0, 1, 2, 3. thus,

(4)e 

1
2r

(dd + p )f (1) + o(cid:16) 1
r2(cid:17),

since (4)e is traceless, (1)f satises

using this and introducing (4) e = r (4)e , we can show

(d2 + 3)f (1) = 0.

now we dene the adm energy by

d(4) e = 0.

eadm := 

1

8 zc

ds  et

(55)

(56)

(57)

(58)

where where t is the asymptotic conformal killing vector associated with the global time-translation symmetry
induced at spatial innity and c is a 2-dimensional closed surface in the 3-dimensional unit timelike hyperboloid. the
above integration is invariant under the change of the closed surface c because eq. (57) gives d((4) et ) = 0. this
means that eadm is conserved.

v. summary and discussion

we have carefully investigated the asymptotic behavior of the linear perturbation around the single brane solution
of the rs brane-world scenario [2]. it is known that the eect of the 5-dimensional curvature appears in the form
of e , which is the electric part of the 5-dimensional weyl tensor, on the right-hand side of the eective einstein
equations on the brane [21]. to deal with this part of the weyl tensor directly, we have employed the curvature tensor
perturbation formalism developed in [21] instead of the metric perturbation formalism.

for static perturbations, we have found that e on the brane falls o as r5 from the source and the weyl
curvature in the bulk behaves regularly near the cauchy horizon (z = ) as cc = o(z2), in accordance
with the previous result obtained in the metric perturbation formalism [2,17].

for generic perturbations, we have found the perturbation diverges as cc = o(v4) near the cauchy
horizon (v = , u =const.). this implies instability of the cauchy horizon. however, we have found that this
instability does not aect the brane-world because cc = o(u3) for u = v   ( < 1) due to the innite
redshift eect. this supports the conjecture by chamblin and gibbons [3] that the cauchy horizon instability would
not aect the brane-world.

8

we have also found that e decays rapidly as s5 on the brane for generic spacetime-dependent perturbations,
where s2 = t2  r2. this is to be contrasted with the case of a radiative eld (like electromagnetic radiation) that
behaves like s2(to avoid the confusion, a radiation eld behaves like  r4 at spatial innity.). this implies e does
not carry energy away from the system to innity. together with the fact that e = o(r5) for static perturbations,
we have concluded that the adm energy is well-dened also in the brane-world and it is conserved.

one remaining issue is the positivity of the adm energy. in the linear perturbation, the right-hand side of the
eective einstein equations has the additional term, e . if euu > 0, where u is an arbitrary timelike vector,
the brane will be stable in the semi-classical level. in this connection, recent work on cosmological solutions that e00
is proportional to the mass of the 5-dimensional schwarzshild-ads spacetime [1012,18] implies it is positive. on the
contrary, our result of the perturbation analysis given in eq. (40) has the opposite sign. one might suspect that our
result is incorrect. however, there is a good reason to believe that our result is indeed correct. remember that e00
is the tidal force in the 5th direction. when there is a mass in the bulk, this means we have a force that tends to
tear apart the matter on the brane in the 5th direction, hence gives a repulsive contribution. this means the energy
is positive, in accordance with cosmological results obtained in [1012,18]. on the other hand, because of the very
nature of the tidal force, a mass on the brane exerts a force that tends to squeeze the matter in the 5th direction
at least in the far zone, meaning it works as an attractive force. this means it is a negative energy contribution,
just like the newtonian eective gravitational energy. it is therefore impossible to judge whether the positivity of the
adm energy is guaranteed or not within the present perturbation analysis. some global non-linear analysis will be
necessary to resolve this issue.

appendix a: asymptotic flatness at spatial infinity

we briey describe the denition of asymptotic atness and some useful results obtained in 4-dimensional asymp-
totically at spacetimes (see refs. [25,26] for the details and exact descriptions ).
in this appendix the notation
basically follows ref. [26], which is slightly dierent from the main text of this paper. below the sux a, b, ... denotes
the abstract index [27].

denition: a spacetime (m, qab) will be said to be asymptotically at at spacelike innity i if there exists a smooth
function  satisfying the following features (i), (ii) and the energy momentum tensor satises the fall o condition
(iii);

(i) |i = 0 and d|i 6= 0 .

(ii) the following quantities have smooth limits on i .

ra = 4qabdb ,

pab = 2(qab  f 14dadb) = 2pab,

where f = r .

(iii) t := tab(e)

a

(e )

b = o(4) near i, where {(e)

a} =0,1,2,3 is a tetrad of the metric qab.

in this formalism,   r1. for example, the extrinsic curvature of the  = cosnt. hypersurface is written as

ab :=

where ra := ra/prbrb. from the 4-dimensional einstein equations under the condition (i), (ii) and (iii), we nd

f =1

and

(3) rab =2pab,

where the hatted equality, =, denotes the evaluation on i. this gives the 3-dimensional riemann tensor as

(3) rabcd =2pa[c pd]b ,

which means that the 3-dimensional  = 0 surface is locally a unit 3-dimensional timelike hyperboloid.

a part of the gravitational eld is described by the electric part of the 4-dimensional weyl tensor,

from a rather lengthy argument, we nd there exists an asymptotic conformal killing vector, a, such that a = da
and   pab =2pab or da db + pab =0. the conformal killing vector induces the time-translation symmetry at spatial
innity. the asymptotic conformal killing vector t appeared in sec. iv is just d.
