abstract

recently a modied faddeev-popov path integral density for the quantization of yang-

mills theory was derived, the modication consisting in the presence of specic f inite

contributions of the pure gauge degrees of freedom. due to the gribov problem the

gauge xing can be dened only locally and the whole space of gauge potentials has to

be partitioned into patches. we propose a global path integral density for the yang-mills

theory by summing over all patches, which can be proven to be manifestly independent

of the specic local choices of patches and gauge xing conditions, respectively.

the faddeev-popov [1] path integral procedure constitutes one of the most popular

quantization methods for yang-mills theory and is widely used in elementary particle

physics. it is, however, well known that at a non perturbative level due to the gribov

ambiguity [2] a unique gauge xing in the full space of gauge elds is not possible so that

the faddeev-popov path integral procedure is dened only locally in eld space.

several attempts were presented to generalize the above approach in order to establish

global integral representations. we especially point out the use of equivariant cohomo-

logical techniques by [3] and the method of implementing brst invariance globally by

[4].

it is our aim to present a quite dierent argumentation based on a recently introduced

generalized stochastic quantization scheme [5, 6].

let p (m, g) be a principal ber bundle with compact structure group g over the
compact euclidean space time m. let a denote the space of all irreducible connections
on p and let g denote the gauge group, which is given by all vertical automorphisms on
p reduced by the centre of g. then g acts freely on a and denes a principal g-bration
a  a/g =: m over the paracompact [7] space m of all inequivalent gauge potentials
with projection . due to the gribov ambiguity the principal g-bundle a  m is not
globally trivializable.

from [7] it follows that there exists a locally nite cover {u} of m together with a

set of background gauge elds {a()

0  a} such that

 = {b  1(u)|d

the original eld space a we consider the familiy of trivial principal g-bundles  g

with b  , g  g and bg denoting the gauge transformation of b by g.

using this mathematical setting we succeeded in formulating a new generalized

stochastic quantization procedure for yangmills theory in conguration space which

led to the derivation of a modied faddeevpopov path integral density: we recall that
a admits a natural metric which gives rise to an induced metric g on   g. the
corresponding density is given by  = det g where

det g = 2 (detf)2 (det a

)1.

here  = qdet(r

ential of right multiplication transporting any tangent vector in tgg back to the identity

let sg  c (g) be an arbitrary functional on g such that esg is integrable with

respect to . then the expression

 estot

 , stot

 = 

s + pr

gsg

(4)

appears as our modied solution for the (non-normalized) path integral density [6]. here
stot
  c (  g) denotes a total yang-mills action dened by the original yang-mills
action s  c (a) without gauge symmetry breaking terms and by the above sg; prg is
the projector  g  g. our modication for the path integral consists in the presence
of specic f inite contributions along the gauge group. it should be remarked, however,

that all expectation values of gauge invariant observables coincide with the conventional

faddeev-popov results. we stress once more that due to the gribov ambiguity the usual

faddeevpopov approach as well as our modied version are valid only locally in eld

space.

in order to compare expectation values on dierent patches we consider the dieo-

morphism in the overlap of two patches

12 : (11(u2))g  (21(u1))g
here 2 : 1(u2)  g is uniquely dened (see [6]) by 2(b) = idg, if b  2. to
the density  there is associated a corresponding twisted top form on   g (see e.g.

12(b, g) := (b2 (b)1

, g). (5)

[8]) which for simplicity we denote by the same symbol. using for convenience a matrix

representation of g [6] we straightforwardly verify that


12 2 = 1 .

this immediately implies that in overlap regions the expectation values of gauge invariant
observables f  c (a) are equal when evaluated in dierent patches

suppose now that we consider a dierent locally nite cover {u 

a new set of background gauge elds {a()
as well as new maps 

, densities 

, total actions s  tot

} of m together with
} of local sections,
and another partition of unity


 are given. applying the above integration formula in overlap regions we can prove

furthermore that

finally we propose the denition of the global expectation value of a gauge invariant
observable f  c (a) by summing over all the partitions  such that

hfi = p rg

(9)

(for a preliminary presentation of this result see [9]). due to (8) it is trivial to prove that
the global expectation value hfi is independent of the specic choice of the locally nite
cover {u}, of the choice of the background gauge elds {a()
0 } and of the choice of the
partition of unity , respectively.

as already indicated in [6] these structures can equally be translated into the original

eld space a. evidently, the locally dened densities  as well as estot
globally well dened twisted top form  on a

 give rise to a

( estot

 ).

(10)

the global expectation value (9) then reads

hfi = ra  f
ra 

(11)

which due to the discussion from above is independent of all the particular local choices.

summarizing we recall that the stochastic quantization approach [6] yielded a local

path integral in terms of  estot

 which assured gaussian decrease along the gauge xing

surface as well as along the gauge orbits. the inherent interrelation of the eld variables
on g subsequently led to simple relations of the local densities in the overlap regions
and eventually to a global path integral formulation.

it is a forthcoming challenge to resume the renormalization programm of yang-mills

theory along these new lines.
