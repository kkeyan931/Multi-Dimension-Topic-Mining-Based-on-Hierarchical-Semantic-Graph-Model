(26) condition solved assuming three-fold intersections one-forms take values lie algebra xed torus = lie(t). finally, two-form eld made lie algebra valued well. ready write ansatz non-abelian general- ization hypercohomology. strategy try nd non-abelian generalization two-cochain w, together corresponding new cocycle conditions transformation rules. addition two-cocycle turn actually necessary also include xed one-cochain v together transformation rules. one-cochain need closed. following, consider xed two-cocycle xed one-cochain w = h g v = h  , a , b , ,  action two cochains = h h ,  = h k 11 (27) (28) (29) (30) them. one two-forms take values lie algebra g, functions corresponding lie group. turn out, v de- scribes local principal bundle coordinate patch, isomorphisms bundles dierent though intersecting patches. bundle global, cocycle conditions = 1 1 ( + d) = 0 (31) (32) would satised everywhere. abelian case cocycle conditions succinctly stated saying v closed, dv = 0. bundles v could fail global bundle class g = trivial. identication w actually measures extent structure v local; hence obstruction making v global bundle. nested structure acts gauge transformations v, act w. particular, action w h , = ghh1 g = h1 b = b + f () , (a + + d)h , (33) (34) (35) f (x) = dx+xx. v disposal could dened b = b + d() instead (35), would lead wrong transformation properties (44) later on. gauge transformations act according = k1 h = k1 hk ( + d)k . local principal bundles. action w b = k1 bk , action induced (37). highest object obeys cocycle condition dw = 0 namely, g g1 g g1 = 1 g1 dg + = 0 f (a) + b b = 0 u , u , u . 12 (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) call collection elds w non-abelian one-gerbe satises consistency conditions. ever zero-gerbes v obey cocycle conditions dv = 0 = 0 actually locally dened principal g-bundles. former assumed globally closed dv 6= 0, otherwise would indeed extend global principal bundle, obstruction w, actually interested, vanish. also assuming closed would imply act least abelian case trivially w. also geometrical interpretation: set gauge transformations . take care cocycle conditions dw = 0 invariant action . rst two conditions still trivial, thanks assumption relevant elds collapse tori triple intersections, cf.
