(2.6) turns one performs transformation one automatically takes type theory type b theory. learn two things this: first, half many dierent string theories thought, second, see theories may compactify them. decompactication loses important degrees freedom (in case string winding modes, go innite energy) necessary see equivalence. equivalences seen perturbation theory, might begin suspect equivalences might 9 appear nonperturbatively. hope realize possibility theory formulated perturbation series? key answering question notion susy preserving bps states. explain are, let introduce susy algebra { qa, qb} = abp (2.7) actually, simplest susy algebra one given dimension. see complicated ones moment. look particle representations susy algebra, p either timelike lightlike vector. timelike case, matrix right hand side (2.7) nondegenerate, lightlike case degenerate half states representation annihilated it. means lightlike case half susy generators annihilate every state representation. thus massless supermultiplets smaller massive ones. means, general supersymmetric theory, small changes parameters give mass massless particles. order one must number massless multiplets together form larger massive multiplet (the super higgs mechanism) order states lifted. case values parameters, small changes cannot make massless particles remain. course, really need susy come conclusion massless particles high enough spin. case already true lorentz group representations massless massive particles dierent multiplicity. new feature really comes compactify theory way preserves susy generators. done compactifying torus appropriate boundary conditions. susy algebra remains same, components momentum discrete. also, lorentz group broken lorentz group noncompact dimensions, spinor representation breaks number copies lower dimensional spinor. algebra looks like { qi abpij + abz ij. a, qj b} = (2.8) spinor vector indices run lower dimensional values, i, j label dierent copies lower dimensional spinor higher dimensional one. generators z ij scalars lower dimension lorentz group. combinations toroidal momenta examples called central charges. consider state carrying nonzero values central charge way higher dimensional momentum lightlike. represents massive kaluza-klein mode massless particle higher dimension. nonsupersymmetric theory 10 masses kaluza klein modes higher dimensional massless elds renormalized quantum corrections. theory extended susy algebra (2.8) ask whether representation annihilated half supercharges (other fractions possible well). is, get computation particles nonzero mass terms central charges. mass cannot change parameters theory varied way preserve extended susy, rather formula variation parameters may read directly susy algebra. see possible realize central charges z ij extended lower dimensional susy algebra ways. instead representing kk momenta toroidal compactication, might arise winding numbers extended objects, called branes, around compact manifold. italicized conclusion valid states well. argument statement italics above, based smaller dimension representation. see explicitly, work frame spatial momentum zero, take expectation value anticommutator states single particle mass (actually mean whole susy multiplet particles). (2.8) reads mij + 0z ij = < + > 0. (2.9) last inequality follows taking expectation value positive operator. says mass bounded square root sum squares eigenvalues matrix z, also called central charges. equality achieved expectation value vanishes, which, since susy charges hermitian, means charges annihilate every state representation. special representations algebra smaller dimension cannot change generic representation, satises strict inequality, parameters continuously varied. thus, theories extended susy, certain masses calculated exactly susy algebra. special states called bogolmony prasad sommereld bps states, since authors rst encountered phenomenon classical studies solitons . connection susy, makes classical calculations exact quantum statements, noticed olive witten . notice although motivated argument terms kaluza-klein states, depends mathematically structure extended susy algebra. thus obtain algebra another way, still bps states. alternative origin central charges bps states comes wrapped branes higher dimensional theory. 11 understand notion, note that, strictly point view lorentz invariance, susy algebra could contain terms like {qa, qb} = abp + 1...p ab z1...p (2.10) multiple indices antisymmetrized. famous haag-lopusanski-sohnius  generalization coleman mandula theorem, tells us pth rank antisym- metric tensor charge, must vanish nite energy particle states. hand, purely spatial components precisely right lorentz properties count number innite energy p-branes, p-dimensional domain walls, oriented given hyperplane. say brane charges talk branes gauge theories below. suppose compactied p dimensions, resulting compact space topologically nontrivial p-dimensional submanifold, p-cycle. see mean, consider two torus b                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 aa figure 1: two torus nontrivial cycles labelled. two dierent kinds nontrivial 1 cycle, labelled b gure. whole torus nontrivial two cycle. word nontrivial cycle cycle implies submanifold cannot contracted point wraps around hole manifold. wrap p-brane around p-cycle, get nite energy particle state. tensor charge indices pointing compact directions scalar charge remaining noncompact directions allowed appear central charge extended susy algebra. often, corresponding particles bps property. background, get story m. practitioners string du- ality realized bps states gave powerful handle nonperturbative physics. 12 example, consider weakly coupled string theory solitonic state, whose mass string units proportional gr 7. bps state coupling becomes innitely strong, becomes innitely lighter string scale (if bps property, could trust weak coupling formula strong coupling). cases studied one can, thinking lightest bps states strong coupling limit, realize elementary states another weakly coupled theory. cases, another string theory, famous exception. one considers type iia string theory ten dimensions, contains single u(1) gauge eld. none perturbative states charged eld;
