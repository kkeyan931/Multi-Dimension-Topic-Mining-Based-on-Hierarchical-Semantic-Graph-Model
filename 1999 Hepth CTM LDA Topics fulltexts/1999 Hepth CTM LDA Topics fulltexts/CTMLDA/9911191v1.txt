abstract

in this paper,we rst give arguments supporting the idea that a b.t.z

black hole can face a transplanckian problem even when its mass is small.

k.m.m quantum theory is applied to the hawking evaporation of schwarzchild

and b.t.z black holes.working in the physically safe quasi position repre-

sentation, we argue that the oscillating term present in a previous analysis

is removed so that actually one doesnt need an average procedure.we ex-

pand the s wave function as the exponential of a series in the minimal

length of the new quantum theory.this reduces an innite order dieren-

tial equation to a numerable set of nite order ones.we obtain the striking

result that the innity of arbitrary constants induced by the order of the

wave equation has no physical meaning due to normalisation.we nally

construct gaussian wave paquets and study their trajectories .we suggest a

quantitative description of the non locality zone and its dependance on the

k.m.m energy scale. potential incidences on unitarity are briey evoked .

1 introduction

hawking eect [1]is of crucial importance for black hole physics.classically those

objects are stable and dont emitt any signal:they can be detected only through

their strong gravitational elds.however,at the quantum level the situation is rad-

ically dierent.due to inequivalent vacuua interplay,black hole emitt energy.for

example,the emission of massless charged scalars in the scharzchild geometry is

thermal,at a temperatire proportional to the inverse of the black hole mass.due

to this phenomenon,a black hole is no more eternal after its birth:its life time goes

like the cube of its mass. this emission nicely feets the entropy and the tempera-

ture predicted by bekenstein [2]. in spite of its inner beauty imbricating classical

general relativity and quantum eld theory,the hawking emission is plagued by

two major problems.the rst one is unitarity:it is not obvious that one can suc-

cesfully handle a situation in which the source of gravity(the black hole) and

the partner of the emitted particle nally merge into the singularity.the second

problem is the transplanckian one :to be detected in the asymptotic region at

the predicted momentum,the emitted photon should cross the star surface with

a very big momentum.at this scale it is quite evident that the approximation

by a noninteracting scalar eld is not reliable.in the begining of its journey,the

hawking photon also hugs the horizon at incredibly small distances. in this pa-

per we adress the second question.a truncation scheme modifying the dispersion

relation was initiated by [?],[4] ,[5] and also used by [9] to cure the desease.a

recent tentative [10] is a priori more fundamental since the change in the dis-

persion relation is not put by hand but appears as a consequence of a new

quantum theory. k.m.m approach [6],[7],[8] changes the rules of quantum me-

chanics in a very simple way and obtains a theory in which the uncertainty in

position admitts a lower bound.one can then anticipate that this limit to local-

isability will forbid the hawking particle to remain too close to the horizon. a

rst attempt in this way raised a conceptual problem .working in the momen-

1

tum representation of the k.m.m commutation relations,the s wave mode was

calculated.going to position representation by a fourrier like tranform,it was re-

alised that the result did not satisfy the wave equation !it was then argued that

this equation had to be veried only in average but the average procedure is still

missing. in this paper we apply k.m.m formalism more carefully and restrict

ourselves to physically meaningfull representations . the most sallient point is

that in the new quantum quantum mechanics,states of denite positions do

not exist.their energy is innite,they are not physical . consequently,position

representation doesnt exist and the equation we tried to interpret is physically

irrelevant.the unproblematic quasi position representation is the best one for

our purposes.when the minimal length uncertainty goes to zero,it reduces to the

well known position representation.we use it in the 3 + 1schwarzchild solution

and the 2 + 1 b.t.z geometry [12],[11].the behaviour of the modes near the

horizon gratify our wishes to the full . the paper is organised as follows.in the

rst section we focus on b.t.z black holes and the quantitative formulation of its

planckian problem.in the second section we review the fundamentals of k.m.m

theory and insist on the allowed representations.we then criticise [10] and derive

more physically motivated wave equations. we handle the quasi position wave

function in a perturbative way and nally construct the wave paquets.

introduction

the introduction of a cosmological constant in einstein equations

in a 2 + 1 space -time generates, for  > 0, the btz [12],[11] metric which,for a

vanishing angular momentum,reads

ds2 = (r2  m)dt2 

dr2

r2  m  r2d2

(1)

and is a solution for the eld around a point source with an event horizon.

this black hole can be obtained by the collapse of a pressureless dust sur-

rounded by a vacuum region [26]. the horizon and the surface of the collapsing

star coincide at nite comoving time but at innite exterior time .

to better apprehend the btz geometry, let us study the classical motion of

a particle in its background. as t and  are cyclic coordinates, one obtains two
constants of motion : the energy e and the angular momentum l. the on shell

mass condition can be rewritten as

)2 = e2  v 2
the potential governing the radial motion being

(

ef f (r) =  l2  m + r2 
v 2

it is a strictly increasing function. as v 2

ef f () = , the classical trajectory of

any massive particle is bounded, contrary to the schwarzchild solution

for a massless particle,

(

r2 > l2e2

the accessible region veries 1

and so, contrary to massive particles,

some photons (not all) can go to innity. for a xed energy, there is an upper

bound l


such that when l > l


, the photon is conned to a bounded portion

of the space .

2.2 existence of the planckian problem

q.f.t in a b.t.z geometry and related thermodynamic properties have been

extensively studied [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23]. in the schwarzchild

3

geometry, the eddington-finkelstein coordinates are the best in which the planck-

ian problem is revealed [9].as the essential of the hawking radiation takes place

in the s channel,one usually study the slices  = c st,  = c st. a photon which is

detected at innity after a time corresponding to the life time of the black hole

must have crossed the surface of the star with a momentum which is so big that

free scalar eld description is dubious : this is the transplanckian problem. put

in formula, a photon whose typical energy is 0(m1) reach a distance x = 0(m)

from the horizon after a time v = 0(m 3) only if it crossed the star surface with
a momentum pst  0(m1em 2) which is very large for a typical black hole.

what is the situation for the btz geometry?

one rapidly nds [11]

so that the metric in the ingoing eddington-finkelstein coordinates becomes

ds2 = (r2  m)dv2  2dvdr

the s wave equation

r[(r2  m)r + 2v](v, r) = 0

can be obtained from the hamiltonian

h = (r2  m)p2 + 2pvp

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

to derive the presence of the transplanckian problem for the b.t.z geometry, we

shall follow closely [9].the hamiltonian equations of motion are

r = 2(r2  m)p + 2pv

p = 2rp2

v = 2p

pv =

pst is the value taken by p when v = 0 ;it is the momemtum with which the

photon crosses the horizon.

lets give an estimate of the btz black hole life time in a very nave way. first

of all, the total mass-energy of the black hole is not m. actually, one can dene

masses in two dierent but related ways. like in [11] , one may introduce the

displacements at innity n, n  and identify as mass m and angular momentum

j their conjugates variables in the hamiltonian formalism. but, when studying

stellar structures, it is natural to dene as mass m the volume integral of the

total energy density. one then nds that the two quantities are related [25]:

m = m + 1

(12)
the quantity m is dimensionless; it gives the mass using as unit (g/c2)1.
as the typical energy of a photon is 0(t  m), one nds (neglecting back

reaction) that the total number of photons the star can radiate is 0( m +1
m

). as

the typical time corresponding to a photon is 0((m)1/2), the black hole will

desappear after a time

tb.h = 0(

m + 1
m

(m)1/2) = (

m + 1

m

)

(13)

so, for very massive btz black holes, the life-time depends only on the cos-

mological constant.detailed analysis should take into account the back reaction

; we nevertheless believe formula (13) gives a correct order of magnitude.two

5

points should however be claried.the rst one is only a technical question:what

is the fraction of energy emmited in s- waves? in the schwarzchild case ,it is

90pc.altough we have not completed the computation,equations (4) and (3) show

that compared to the scharzchild geometry,less modes can attain spatial inn-

ity.the same formula also reveals that for a given energy ,the s photons are

priviledgied.so,one can reasonably conjecture that the two dimensional (radial)

model still exhibits the most important physical features.the second point is a

more fundamental one.to give an estimate of the typical energy of a photon in

the asymptotic region,we used the equipartition theorem with the absolute tem-
perature t = 2m.one knows that in a curved background thermodynamic
temperature t should be dened as a space-time dependent object[29] ;then the
quantity tg00 is the same in the hole geometry.in the asymptotic scharzchild
region,g00 = 1 and so all static observers in this zone measure the same tem-

perature .for b.t.z geometry,g00 is an increasing function of the distance:the
situation is dierent . we shall assume that t = 2m is measured by an
observer whose distance to the horizon is of the order of the black hole radius

;this is already the case for scharzchilds solution. we do not impose reexive

conditions on the boundary and so we discard the cases where an equilibrium can

be attained [27].

now, consider a photon which crosses the star surface at v = 0 (with mo-

mentum pst ). when it reaches a distance comparable to the black hole radius
(x = r q m
 ) after a time of the order of the black hole life time tb.h = m +1
m  ,
its frequency typically equals the black hole temperature  = 2m.putting all
this in equation (11.b),one nds

pst = e

(14)

for a xed cosmological constant, this goes to innity as the mass of the black

6

hole increases. this is not the only planckian problem in btz.

one can give to m a reasonable value and take a very small cosmological con-

stant : the momentum of a hawking photon crossing the star surface is again too

large and our description is no more reliable.this kind of transplanckian problem

is not present in the schwarzchild geometry.let us also note from equations(11)

that the photon hugs the horizon. it is straightforward that the truncation given

by

with the choice g(p) = 


p f or p < 1
1 f or p  1

: photons do not hug the horizon anymore.

h = g(p)[2mxg(p) + 2pv]

(15)

avoids transplanckian problems like in [9]

this is a classical approach. we need a quantum conrmation in which the

classical trajectories will be given by the path of the saddle of the wave packets

in the truncated theory.as explained in the introduction,well not use equation

(15) but shall rather apply k.m.m theory.

to complete the analysis,we point out the dependence of the eective po-

tential on the angular momentum . one important dierence between btz and

schwarzchild geometries lies in the fact that, as the former possess a non null

ricci scalar, minimal and conformal gravitationnal couplings are dierent. how-

ever, r being constant, this gravitationnal coupling is strictly equivalent to a

mass term and will be discarded.the derivation of the eective potential is easy

and directly reveals the eld asymptotic behaviour which can also be inferred

from the exact solution.

the separation of variables given by

 = r1/2eileitrl(r)

reduces the klein-gordon equation in the btz conguration to

(20)

in the btz background ,one can invert the relation dening the tortose coordi-

nate :

(21)

so that at spatial innity r   1

this equation is very dierent of the corresponding one in schwarzchild geometry

(23)

the behaviour of the modes in the asymptotic btz region is universal :

it

is, like in the schwarzchild geometry, independent of the characteristics (m, )

of the black hole . in addition, it keeps no trace of the frequency  as shown

in equation(22). the change of the angular content of the theory when lowering

the space-time dimension is encoded in the potential through the term l2 whose

corresponding quantity is l(l + 1) in a 3 + 1 theory.

the equation (23), valid at spatial innity, admitts simple solutions : r3/2



and

r3/2

.this was derived after an exact but lengthier calculation by [23].

3 k.m.m theory in short

kempf,mangano and mann [6, 7, 8] replace the usual commutator relation by

[x, p] = ih(1 + x2 +  p2)

(25)

this simple modication induces very profound consequences.the most impor-

tant is the fact that the heisenberg uncertainty relation becomes

xp >

h
2

(1 +  < x >2 +(x)2 +  < p >2 +(p)2)

(26)

we restrict ourselves to  = 0 .the motivation of this choice will be clear

later.solving the heisenberg inequality for p,one easily obtains

(27)
the absolute minimum uncertainty in position x0 = h is attained when <
p >= 0.so,the new commutation relations imply that position can not be known

(x)2  h2 + h22 < p >2

with arbitrary precision,even if one increases the uncertainty in momentum .the

case  = 0 is interesting because it admitts a momentum representation.in fact,

on the domain s



of functions decreasing faster than any power,the operator

algebra is realised through

p.(p) = p(p)

x.(p) = ih(1 + p2)p(p)

(28)

(29)

s



must be endowed with a hilbert structure.the scalar product must be

chosen so that x and p are at least symmetric.this is the case if

9

< | >= z +



dp

1 + p2 (p)(p)

(30)

the normalised position eigenvectors,solutions of x =  are the wave func-

tions

(p) = rqe

i

h

arctanp

(31)

the divergence of the quantity < |p2 > shows that these states have innite
energy and so are unphysical.contrary to usual quantum theory,they cannot be

attained as continous limits of states of nite energy and decreasing uncertainty

in position .by way of consequence ,there is no position representation of the

operator algebra . the scalar product of two distinct position eigenstates

< | >=

h

(  )

sin

(  )
2h

(32)

is not necessarily null :the operators x is not self adjoint but only symmetric; it

admitts a class of self adjoint extensions. to recover information on position ,
one denes the maximally localised states |ml

 > as states in which

 the mean value of the position operator is  :< |x >= .
 the uncertainty in position is minimal (x) = (x0) = h

in the momentum representation one nds those state wave functions to be

ml

 (p) = r2q/(1 + p2)1/2e

h arctan (p)

i

(33)

they are well dened and of nite energy. the quasi position representation is

dened by

() =< ml

(34)

and is interpreted as the probability for the particle to be maximally localised at

. for a plane wave, one nds the dispersion relation

4 application to black hole physics

to begin this section let us emphasize that there should not be an oscillating

term ,contrary to what was claimed in [10].for this let us review the main points

of the analysis performed in that paper:

1. the wave function () was computed in the momentum representation.( =

4m and  = arctan p)

2. the position wave function (x) = ar /2

0

deix() was worked out.

3. it was found that the right member of the position wave equation

(x tan (ix)  )

(39)

was not zero but aei/2x.a tentative was then made to explain this in-

triguing fact.

the most important characteristic of k.m.m theory when  6= 0 is the inexis-
tence of a physically meaningfull position representation. as explained in the

11

preceding section,we only have a quasi position representation.as can be inferred

from (34),this is related to the momentum one by

(x) = az /2

0

d cos()eix()

(40)

if the transform is well dened(and k.m.m show explicitely this to be the

case), this is naturally a solution of the wave equation in the quasi position

representation.but,in this representation,the position operator is not simply the

multiplication by x,( see formula (37)) and so the relevant equation is not (39).in

brief,the oscillating term appeared due to misleading in representations.let us

handle the problem more carefully.

4.1 schwarzchild geometry

the s wave equation of a complex scalar eld in the scharzchild background is

(ixp  2i(x + 2m))(x) = 0

(41)

 being the frequency.its quantum counterpart in the momentum representation

reads

(ih(1 + p2)  4m)(p) + ih(1 + p2)(p  2)p(p) = 0

(42)

contrary to what is usually done in the litterature [9],[10] we did not restrict

ourselves to the region near the horizon:this results in an extra term in equation

(41). one may solve this equation and use the fourrier like transform specied

by equation(34) to obtain the quasi position wave function, but the integral is not

trivial.we can directly consider the quasi position representation wave equation

h
  2


h

((

) tan (i) + (tan (i))2  2  4m)() = 0

(43)
with  = h the minimal length uncertainty. this is an innite order dierential
in particular,its order suggests its
equation. a priori it is dicult to handle.

12

general solution involves an innity of arbitrary constants. actually,there is a

recipe which facilitates the analysis. the minimal length  present in the tangent

argument plays a crucial role when one expands the operators in their taylor

series.

in fact,the dierential operator acting on () is analytic in . if we

could write a similar expansion for the wave function,then we would obtain a

dierential equation for each order. this would mean that we have replaced one

innite order equation by an illimited but numerable set of nite order ones. it

is physically resonable to expect that the k.m.m wave function dependance on

the minimal length is a smooth one. this is the case for the harmonic oscillator.

one is then tempted to use

() = f0() + f1() + 2f2() +   

(44)

but,when studing trajectories,we are interested in the phase of the wave func-

tion.so,it is more interesting to choose the parametrisation

() = ef0()+f1()+2f2()+

the s wave equation then takes the form

two observations are important for the resolution:

 the function fn() appears for the rst time in eq(n),through its rst deriva-

tive

 eq(n) doesnt involve fm() for m > n :

f n() = fn(f 0(), f 0 (), ..., f n1(), f n1(), ....)

(52)

solving eq(0),we nd f0().putting this in eq(1) we compute f1() ,etc.... each

contribution fn() is determined up to a constant cn but these constants do not

appear in the equations of the fm for m > n.two dierent choices of this family

of constants give two wave functions which dier by a miltiplicative factor and

so yields the same physics.for convenience we put all the ci equal to zero.

one remarks that the odd contributions can consistently be put equal to zero

: f1() = f3() = ... = 0.this is due to the fact that the equation (43) is invariant

under the reversal of the  sign. this analysis is close to perturbation theory.in

fact,perturbation theory expresses the wave function of the modied(perturbed)

system as an entire series in the coupling constant.this role is assumed in our

situation by the minimal length coming from the new commutation relations.the

analogy is pertinent since the zero order solution is eectively the solution of the

unperturbed system dened by  = 0.as in pertrbation theory,the convergence

of the serie is a technically dicult question:well not adress it. for simplicity,lets

14

rst retain only the rst contribution of k.m.m theory to the habitual wave

function:it is proportional to 2.separating the modulus and the phase,we can

write the mode as

let us emphasize that c() is the only one which doest vanish with .the

new wave function diers signicantly from the old one near the origin where
it vanishes due to the e1/xi2 factor.in the asymptotic region the inverse powers

of  can be neglected for frequences near 1/m and so one recovers the habitual

behaviour. let us now study the classical trajectory associated with the gaussian

wave paquet

(, v) = z 



de

(0)2

2 (, v)

(59)

due to equation (53),the integrand is the product of two factors:the modulus and

the phase.for a xed point (, v) of space time,two frequences are important:

 the frequency 1(, v) for which the modulus is maximal

 the frequency 2(, v) for which the phase is stationnary

15

if 1 and 2 are very dierent ,the gaussian integral is negligeable.in fact,the

contributions of the neighberhood of 1 in the integral have important abso-

lute values but the phase oscillates rapidly and those contributions essentially

cancel.the same conclusion holds for the neighberhood of 2 :the phase varies

slowly,the contributions interfer in a constructive way.but their modulus are small

and the result is not signicant.the wave function is signicantly dierent from
zero at the points (, v) for which 1(, v)  2(, v). it can consequently be
characterised by the equality 1(, v) = 2(, v).the modulus of the integrand

possesses a maximum only if

2b() < 1

for all physical ;it is located at

1(, v) = 

the phase is stationnary at

2( 1

2 + b())

2(, v) = d() qd()2  3(v + c())e()

the preceding discussion then gives the trajectory without explicit computation

of the integral:

v() = c()

3e()  d() 

3e()(a() + 20
2 )
2( 1

2 + b()) !2

(63)

a trivial analysis shows that when  goes to zero,the rst term is the only one

which survives .one then simply recovers the well known trajectory of habitual

minkowski wave paquets. we saw that the condition 2b() < 1 is necessary for

the real factor of the integrand to be bounded.as this must be fullled for all

positive ,we conclude that the notion of trajectory doesnt apply to gaussian

paquets with characteristics outside a given region in the plane (0, ).the non

locality of such wave paquets manifests itself in the entire space time. from

16

equation (62) it is obvious that the frequency 2 is real provided

v > sign(e()) 3c() 

d()2

e() !

(64)

when this inequality is not satised,the phase is nowhere stationnary on the

real axis of the .as we argued,this would imply destructive interference almost

everywhere on this axis.the wave function is then deprived of a peak and the

notion of trajectory is lost in this region.we also saw that the condition 2b() < 1

is necessary for the modulus to be bounded.calling 1 > 2 the zeros of 2b() = 1

,one nds:

1. if  < 1

 , inequality (61) is veried by all real .the region of non locality
is composed of the space time points (, v) which violate the inequality (64).

2. if   1

 ,the non locality region satises the supplementary condition
 < 1. a trivial computation shows that 1 < 0. by way of consequence,in

this case non locality manifests itself inside the horizon.then the falling of

the partner to the emitted photon on the singularity would have no signica-

tion.this may in principle put a new light on the unitarity problem,without

advocating the complementarity hypothesis [30],[31].

for a null value of  ,e() vanishes and the last equation shows that the zone

of non locality is empty.

(66)

the preceding analysis is accurate when these contributions can be neglected

when compared to the second orders ones. as shown in the gures,this is not

true near the horizon where the wave function tends to the constant zero. so

,altough our method for identifying the region where non localisability sets in is

qualitatively correct, our approximation of the solution makes quantitavly irrel-

evant the analysis when one is too close to the horizon.in the asymptotic region,

the correction to the phase and the modulus becomes negligeable for typical

hawking photons: one then verify the remarquable conjecture [10] that roughly

speaking, the modication of the commutation relations acts essentially near the

horizon.

let us remark that singular solutions in  may appear when dealing with an

equation implying a series . for simplicity, if one considers the equation (22
 +
 + m2) = 0, then a solution of the form e(1)f1()+f0+f1()+... exhists,with
f
1() linear.as we already argued,such solutions should be discarded .

5 b.t.z geometry

the s mode wave obeys the equation

(x2 p + 2mxp  2) |  >= 0

in the quasi position representation,this becomes

(( +  tan (i))21 tan (i) +
2m( +  tan (i))1 tan (i)  2)() = 0

18

(67)

(68)

the analysis proceeds exactly like in the previous section.the expressions are

simply lengthier,in part due to the supplementary parameter .we expand the

wave function as in equation (45) but we now take null odd contributions from

the begining .this gives the equations eq(0), eq(2), eq(4) and their solutions listed

in the appendix.

6 conclusion

the equation we quantised doesnt treat on the same footing the variables x, v

and so breaks explicitely the covariance. this was also the case in [4],[9],[10]

where it was proved to be unavoidable for solving the transplanckian problem.

since k.m.m itself is a frame dependant formulation,the picture seems bet-

ter.second,the upsetting of the quantum mechanics rules may change the mathe-

matical description of particles.this would result in a modication of the hawking

emission characteristics and should be cleared up. although we have worked ba-

sically with the rst non vanishing correction,we conjecture this describes the

essential physics. in fact  must be very tiny to avoid signicant deviations from

usual quantum mechanics for well known cases like the oscillator,or the hydro-

gen atom.when analysing a gaussian wave pacquet at this order,the non locality

zone exhibited a dependance on its mean frequency and dispersion.altough higher

order corrections may quantitatively change this near the horizon, our computa-

tions strongly suggest that the non locality zone may cover a part of the black

hole interior.if this is true, then the partner of the hawking photon doest merge

with the singularity. this may be promising for the unitarity problem but a more

reliable treatment should include back reaction and use a better approximation

of the wave function near the horizon. last but not least, if there is a minimal

length,a star should not collapse to a point:it would stop at least when its radius

reaches this length. in this case the hawking radiation would rapidly cease.but,as

the gravitationnal collapse is a purely classical mechanism,the details of such a

19

halting mechanism is not trivial.
