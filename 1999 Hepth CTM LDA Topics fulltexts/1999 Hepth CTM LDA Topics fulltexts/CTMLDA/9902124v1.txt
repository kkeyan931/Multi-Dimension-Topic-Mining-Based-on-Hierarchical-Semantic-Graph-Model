abstract

we show the presence of a topological (berry) phase in the time evolution of
a mixed state. for the case of mixed neutrinos, the berry phase is a function
of the mixing angle only.

i. introduction

particle mixing and oscillations play a relevant role in high energy physics. in particular,
in recent years a growing interest in neutrino mixing and oscillations [1] has been developed
which manifests itself both in a strong experimental eort and in a renewed theoretical
research activity. contributions towards the correct theoretical understanding of the eld
mixing have been recently presented [2,3].

in the present paper we show how the notion of berry phase [4] enters the physics of

mixing by considering the example of neutrino oscillations.

since its discovery [4], the berry phase has attracted much interest [5] at theoretical as
well as at experimental level. this interest arises because the berry phase reveals geometrical
features of the systems in which it appears, which go beyond the dynamical specic aspects
and as such contribute to a deeper characterization of the physics involved. the successful
experimental ndings in many dierent quantum systems [5] stimulate further search in this
eld.

aimed by these motivations, we show that the geometric phase naturally appears in the

standard pontecorvo formulation of neutrino oscillations.

our result shows that the berry phase associated to neutrino oscillations is a function of
the mixing angle only. we suggest that such a result has phenomenological relevance: since

geometrical phases are observable, the mixing angle can be (at least in principle) measured
directly, i.e. independently from dynamical parameters as the neutrino masses and energies.
although in the following we treat the neutrino case, we stress that our result holds in

general, also in the case of mixed bosons (kaons,  s, etc..).

ii. berry phase for oscillating neutrinos

let us rst consider the two avor case [1]:

|ei = cos  |1i + sin  |2i
|i =  sin  |1i + cos  |2i .

the electron neutrino state at time t it is [1]

|e(t)i  eiht|e(0)i = ei1t(cid:0)cos  |1i + ei(21)t sin  |2i (cid:1) ,

(1)

(2)

where h|ii = i|ii, i = 1, 2. our conclusions will also hold for the muon neutrino state,
with due changes which will be explicitly shown when necessary.

the state |e(t)i, apart from a phase factor, reproduces the initial state |e(0)i after a

period t = 2

21

:

|e(t )i = ei|e(0)i

,

 = 

21

2  1

.

(3)

we now show how such a time evolution does contain a purely geometric part, i.e. the
berry phase. it is a straightforward calculation to separate the geometric and dynamical
phases following the standard procedure [6]:

e =  +z t

0

he(t)| it |e(t)i dt

= 

21

2  1

+

2

2  1

(1 cos2  + 2 sin2 ) = 2 sin2  .

(4)

we thus see that there is indeed a non-zero geometrical phase , related to the mixing angle
, and that it is independent from the neutrino energies 1, 2 and masses m1, m2. in a
similar fashion, we obtain the berry phase for the muon neutrino state:

 =  +z t

0

h(t)| it |(t)i dt = 2 cos2  .

note that e +  = 2. we can thus rewrite (3) as

|e(t )i = ei2 sin2 eieet |e(0)i ,

where we have used the notation

he(t)| it |e(t)i = he(t)| h |e(t)i = 1 cos2  + 2 sin2   ee .

2

(5)

(6)

(7)

we will also use

h(t)| it |(t)i = h(t)| h |(t)i = 1 sin2  + 2 cos2    ,

h(t)| it |e(t)i = h(t)| h |e(t)i =

1
2

(2  1) sin 2  e ,

(8)

(9)

with e = e.

in order to better understand the meaning of (4)-(6), we observe that, as well known,

|ei is not eigenstate of the hamiltonian, and

he(0)|e(t)i = ei1t cos2  + ei2t sin2  .

(10)

thus, as an eect of time evolution, the state |ei rotates as shown by eq.(10). however,
at t = t ,

he(0)|e(t )i = ei = eieeieet ,

(11)

i.e. |e(t )i diers from |e(0)i by a phase , part of which is a geometric tilt (the berry
phase) and the other part is of dynamical origin. in general, for t = t +  , we have

he(0)|e(t)i = ei he(0)|e( )i

also notice that h(t)|e(t)i = 0 for any t. however,

= ei2 sin2 eieet (cid:0)ei1 cos2  + ei2 sin2 (cid:1) .

(12)

h(0)|e(t)i =

1
2

eiei1 sin 2(cid:0)ei(21)  1(cid:1)

,

f or t = t +  ,

(13)

which is zero only at t = t . eq.(13) expresses the fact that |e(t)i oscillates, getting a
component of muon avor, besides getting the berry phase. at t = t , neutrino states of
dierent avor are again each other orthogonal states.

generalization to ncycles is also interesting. eq.(4) (and (5)) can be rewritten for the

ncycle case as

(n)

e = z nt

0

he(t)| it  1 |e(t)i dt = 2 n sin2  ,

and eq.(12) becomes

he(0)|e(t)i = ein he(0)|e( )i

,

f or t = nt +  .

(14)

(15)

similarly eq.(13) gets the phase ein instead of ei. eq.(14) shows that the berry phase acts
as a counter of neutrino oscillations, adding up 2 sin2  to the phase of the (electron)
neutrino state after each complete oscillation.

eq.(14) is interesting especially because it can be rewritten as

(n)

e = z nt

0

he(t)| u 1(t) it(cid:16)u(t) |e(t)i(cid:17) dt = z nt

0

h e(t)| it| e(t)i = 2 n sin2  , (16)

3

with u(t) = eif (t), where f (t) = f (0)  1t, and

| e(t)i  u(t)|e(t)i = eif (0)(cid:0)cos  |1i + ei(21)t sin  |2i (cid:1) .

eq.(16) actually provides an alternative way for dening the berry phase [6], which makes
use of the state | e(t)i given in eq.(17).
in contrast with the state |e(t)i, | e(t)i is not
rotated or tilted in its time evolution:

(17)

h e(0)| e(t)i = 1

,

f or any t ,

(18)

which is to be compared with eqs.(13) and (15). from eq.(17) we also see that time evolution
only aects the |2i component of the state | e(t)i, so that we have

it| e(t)i = (2  1)eif (0)ei(21)t sin |2i

= (h  1)eif (0) (cid:0)cos  |1i + ei(21)t sin  |2i (cid:1)

= (h  1)| e(t)i .

(19)

we thus understand that eq.(16) directly gives us the geometric phase because the quantity
ih e(t)| e(t)i dt is the overlap of | e(t)i with its parallel transported at t + dt.

another geometric invariant which can be considered is

s = z nt

0

e dt =  n sin 2 .

(20)

since e is the energy shift from the level ee caused by the avor interaction term in the
hamiltonian [1], it is easily seen that

2
e = e2  he(t)|h 2|e(t)i  he(t)|h|e(t)i2 ,

(21)

and then we recognize that eq.(20) gives the geometric invariant discussed in ref. [7], where

it is dened quite generally as s = r e(t)dt. it has the advantage to be well dened also

for systems with non-cyclic evolution.

we now consider the case of three avor mixing. consider again the electron neutrino

state at time t [2]:

|e(t)i = ei1t(cid:0)cos 12 cos 13 |1i + ei(21)t sin 12 cos 13 |2i +

ei(31)tei sin 13 |3i (cid:1) ,

(22)

where  is the analogous of the cp violating phase of the ckm matrix. let us consider the
particular case in which the two frequency dierences are proportional: 3 1 = q(2 1),
with q a rational number. in this case the state (22) is periodic over a period t = 2
and we can use the previous denition of berry phase:

21

 =  +z t

0

he(t)| h |e(t)i dt = 2(cid:0)sin2 12 cos2 13 + q sin2 13(cid:1) ,

(23)

which of course reduces to the result (4) for 13 = 0. eq.(23), however, shows that  is not
completely free from dynamical parameters since the appearance in it of the parameter q.

although because of this,  is not purely geometric, nevertheless it is interesting that
i = 1, 2, 3 , but on the ratio of their

it does not depend on the specic frequencies i,
dierences only. this means that we have now (geometric) classes labelled by q.

it is in our plan to calculate the geometric invariant s for the three avor neutrino state:

this requires consideration of the projective hilbert space in the line of ref. [7].

iii. final remarks and conclusions

the geometric phase is generally associated with a parametric dependence of the time
evolution generator. in such cases, the theory exhibits a gauge-like structure which may
become manifest and characterizing for the physical system, e.g.
in the bohm-aharonov
eect.

it is then natural to ask the question about a possible gauge structure in the case con-
sidered in this paper. let us see how, indeed, a covariant derivative may be here introduced.

let us consider the evolution of the mass eigenstates

i


t

|i(t)i = h |i(t)i ,

(24)

where i = 1, 2. these equations are not invariant under the following (local in time) gauge
transformation

|i(t)i  | i(t)i  u(t)|i(t)i = eif (t)|i(t)i .

they become invariant provided the covariant derivative dt is introduced:

t  dt  t  u 1(t)tu(t) = t + i f (t) .

then

idt| i(t)i = h| i(t)i .

(25)

(26)

(27)

the introduction of the above covariant derivative is equivalent to performing a time-
dependent canonical transformation on the hamiltonian:

h  h = u 1(t)hu(t) = h + u 1(t)itu(t) .

we have indeed

it| i(t)i = (cid:2)h + u 1(t)itu(t)(cid:3) | i(t)i = h| i(t)i ,

(28)

(29)

thus reproducing the initial equations. this last equation shows that h is not the only
responsible of time translations of | i(t)i. there is one more piece, i.e. u 1(t)itu(t),
contributing to the time evolution.

it is such a piece (see eq.(26)) that can be understood as the gauge contribution in this
simple case where the gauge function f (t) only depends on time. note that the state | e(t)i
of eq.(17) is a superposition of the states | i(t)i.

the role of the diabatic force arising from the term u 1(t)itu(t) has been considered

in detail elsewhere [10].

summarizing, we have shown that there is a berry phase built in in the neutrino oscilla-
tions, we have explicitly computed it in the cyclic two-avour case and in a particular case
of three avor mixing. the result also applies to other (similar) cases of particle oscillations.
we have noticed that a measurement of this berry phase would give a direct measurement

of the mixing angle independently from the values of the masses.

5

the above analysis in terms of tilting of the state in its time evolution, parallel trans-
port and covariant derivative also suggests that eld mixing may be seen as the result of
a curvature in the state space. the berry phase appears to be a manifestation of such a
curvature.

finally, we remark that the recognition of the geometric phase associated to mixed states
also suggests to us that a similar geometric phase also occurs in entangled quantum states
which can reveal to be relevant in completely dierent contexts than particle oscillations,
namely in quantum computation [11].
