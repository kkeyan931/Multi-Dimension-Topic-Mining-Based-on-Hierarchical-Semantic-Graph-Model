fermion masses in noncommutative geometry

rich schelp

recent indications of neutrino oscillations raise the question of the possibility of incorporating
massive neutrinos in the formulation of the standard model (sm) within noncommutative geometry
(ncg). we nd that the ncg requirement of poincare duality constrains the numbers of massless
quarks and neutrinos to be unequal unless new fermions are introduced. possible scenarios in which
this constraint is satised are discussed.

i. introduction

ii. noncommutative geometry

the results of recent solar, atmospheric, and accelera-
tor-based neutrino experiments all suggest that neutrino
oscillations do occur [1]. this leads one to the idea that,
as in the case for quarks, the neutrino avor eigenstates
are coherent linear superpositions of mass eigenstates.
for a neutrino of avor  we have

|i =

n

xi=1

ui|ii ,

(1)

where ui is the leptonic mixing matrix. a straightfor-
ward quantum mechanical calculation leads to the follow-
ing expression [2] for the probablility that a neutrino of
avor  with a momentum p will oscillate into a neutrino
of avor  in a distance l:

where mi is the mass of the ith mass eigenstate.

in the usual sm, neutrinos are taken to be massless; ex-
periments have only given upper bounds on the masses.
however, nothing forces neutrinos to be massless, and
if one takes the oscillation experiments seriously, then
the analysis above shows that neutrinos must have mass.
amending the usual sm to accomodate massive neutri-
nos means including r states, yukawa couplings for the
neutrinos, and a leptonic mixing matrix (ui above).

it has been shown that, while a ncg version of the
sm is possible, there are many yang-mills-higgs models
which cannot be formulated within the ncg framework
[3]. in this article we address the question of the extent to
which the ncg formulation of the sm allows for massive
neutrinos. this question has been addressed for an earlier
ncg version of the sm [4]. here we reconsider the issue
in the context of the requirement of poincare duality.

we begin with a brief overview of the main ideas of
ncg as they pertain to models of particle physics. we
refer to [5] for a clear and thorough review of ncg as it
is applied to the sm.

the basic data required to specify a ncg are grouped
together in a package called a real spectral triple [6]. a
spectral triple (a, h, d) consists of a hilbert space h on
which the involutive algebra a is represented as a sub-
algebra of b(h), together with a self-adjoint operator
d. the operator d need not be bounded, but we re-
quire that [d, a] be bounded for all a  a and that the
resolvent (d  )1,  / r of d is compact.
if there
exists an operator  on h which satises  = , 2 = 1,
d = d, and a = a for all a  a, then we classify
(a, h, d) as a even spectral triple. a real spectral triple
is an even spectral triple for which there also exists an
antilinear isometry j which satises jd = dj, j 2 = ,
j = j, where  and  take the values 1. we also
require that both [a, jbj ] and [[d, a], jbj ] vanish for
all a, b  a.

the ncg particle physics models which have been con-
structed thus far all make use of the notion of the product
of real spectral triples. one factor of the product encodes
the spacetime of the model and the other factor encodes
the internal space (the gauge group). for the standard
model the components of the spectral triple are

a = as  af = c(m, c)  (c  h  m3(c)) ,
h = l2(m, s)  hf ,
d = (/  1)  (1  df) .

(3)
(4)
(5)

where hf is a complex hilbert space which has a basis
labeled by the elementary fermions (including antiparti-
cles) and df contains the yukawa couplings and ckm
matrix.

iii. poincar e duality

in classical dierential geometry, poincare duality is
the requirement that for p-forms  and  the scalar prod-
uct

1

(|) =z   

(6)

qij = (pi, pj) = tr(pijpjj ) ,

(11)

vanishes for all  only if  = 0. connes has put forth
seven axioms dening ncgs [7] of which riemannian ge-
ometries are then seen as special cases. the application
of connes generalization of the poincare duality condi-
tion to zero-dimensional spectral triples (ones based on
matrix algebras) is clearly explained in [5]. here we gen-
eralize the ncg formulation of the sm to allow for mas-
sive neutrinos and massless u-type quarks and derive the
implications of poincare duality in this setting.

our rst step is to adjust the representation of the
algebra af = c  h  m3(c). denote an element of af
by the triple (, q, m), where   c, q  h, and m 
m3(c). recall also that a quaternion may be expressed
as q =  + j, where ,   c. for n1 generations of
leptons with massless neutrinos, the representation on
the particle space is

+
1(, q) =

r

(7)

in the remaining n  n1 generations we take the neu-
trinos to be massive, thus the appropriate representation
is

in the above,  denotes e, , or  , not the weak dou-
blets. for the quarks, the representations are the same
except that we replace n1 by n2, the number of gener-
ations for which the charge-2/3 quark is massless, and
tensor each of the above by 1l3 for color. we must also
give the representations of (, q, m) on the antiparticles,
which are simply multiplication by  for the leptons and
multiplication by m for the quarks.

the total hilbert space of the theory is h = (h+
q )  (h

where  is the chirality operator, j is the charge conju-
gation operator, gives the real structure to the spectral
triple, and the pi s are generators of k0(a). for the nite
part of the algebra we are using, k0(af) = z  z  z.
this group is generated by the minimal-rank projections
1 for c, 1l2 for h, and e = diag(1, 0, 0) for m3(c).

for our calculations we choose the same basis as in [5],
in which p1 = (1)e, p2 = 11l2, and p3 = 1. recalling
that n1 denotes the number of massless neutrinos and n2
the number of massless u-type quarks, the chirality and
projections take the form

 7 (1, 0, 1, 1)n1  (1, 1, 1, 1)n n1

(1, 0, 1, 1)3n2  (1, 1, 1, 1)3(n n2)
(1, 0, 1, 1)n1  (1, 1, 1, 1)n n1
(1, 0, 1, 1)3n2  (1, 1, 1, 1)3(n n2) ,

(12)

(1, 0, 0, 0)3n2  (1, 1, 0, 0)3(n n2)
(1, 0, 1, 1)n1  (1, 1, 1, 1)n n1
(e, 03, e, e)n2  (e, e, e, e)n n2 ,

(13)

p2 7 (1, 0, 1, 1)n1  (1, 1, 1, 1)n n1

(1, 0, 1, 1)3n2  (1, 1, 1, 1)3(n n2)
(1, 0, 1, 1)n1  (1, 1, 1, 1)n n1
(0, 0, 0, 0)3n2  (0, 0, 0, 0)3(n n2) ,

p3 7 (1, 0, 0, 0)n1  (1, 1, 0, 0)n n1

(1, 0, 0, 0)3n2  (1, 1, 0, 0)3(n n2)
(1, 0, 1, 1)n1  (1, 1, 1, 1)n n1
(0, 0, 0, 0)3n2  (0, 0, 0, 0)3(n n2) .

(14)

(15)

these projections can be read o from the representa-
tions given above, taking (, q, m) to be (1, 0, e) for p1,
(1, 1l2, 0) for p2, and (1, 0, 0) for p3.

for the nite part of the algebra, jf acts by

jf(cid:18) 

(cid:19) =(cid:18) 

(cid:19) ,

(16)

where (, )  h+  h. the eect on pi of conjugation
by jf is therefore to interchange the rst four terms in
the direct sum with the last four terms. using these
projections, we nd the intersection form q, omitting an
overall factor of 2, to be

the poincare duality condition is rooted in k-theory.
for a zero-dimensional spectral triple the condition
amounts to the nondegeneracy of the intersection form

first of all, we note that for n1 = n massless neutrinos
and n2 = 0 massless quarks, as is the case in the sm, we
get

q = 2n  1

(18)

which agrees with the result of [6]. the determinant of
this matrix is 8n 3, so it is invertible and poincare duality
condition is satised.

if we keep all quarks massive (again, n2 = 0) and let
n1 = 0 so as to build an extension of the sm in which
all neutrinos are massive, the intersection form is

q = 2n  0 1 1

(19)

recovering the result of testard, as published in [5].
here the determinant of q vanishes, indicating that the
poincare duality condition is not satised in this case.

in the general case we nd that in det q = 8(n1 
n2)n 2. the requirement that q be nondegenerate ne-
cessitates that the determinant not vanish. thus, we
must have n1 6= n2.

iv. possible solutions

there are three ways to satisfy this constraint while in-
corporating massive neutrinos: (1) keep all of the quarks
massive (n2 = 0) and let one of the neutrinos (presum-
ably e) remain massless (n1 = 1); (2) give masses to all
of the neutrinos (n1 = 0) and let the up quark remain
massless (so that n2 = 1); (3) give masses to all quarks
and leptons (n1 = n2 = 0) and introduce at least one
new massless neutrino. we now explore these possibili-
ties.

1. no massless quarks, one massless neutrino. the
conventional wisdom with regard to neutrino oscillations
is that neutrino masses are necessary in order for them
to occur. in the standard analysis given in the introduc-
tion, though, only mass dierences play a role, allowing
for the possibility of oscillations between massless and
massive neutrinos. many more sophisticated treatments
of neutrino oscillations have been carried out (see the ref-
erences in [8]), but it seems that in general they do not
rely on neutrino masses, but mass dierences to generate
oscillations.

12, m2
ij = m2

23, and m2
i  m2

with this in mind, we consider a case in which the
eigenvalue of rst of the three mass eigenstates is zero.
in this case there are three mass-squared dierences,
m2
31, which must sum to zero (here
m2
j , where mi is the eigenvalue of the ith
mass eigenstate), leaving two independent masses. set-
ting m1 = 0 xes the overall scale of the masses, but still
leaves two independent parameters. by adjusting m2 and
m3 we can account for two dierent oscillation lengths;

just as is the case were we to add neutrino masses to the
sm. with just two mass scales, we cannot explain the re-
sults of all three neutrino experiments mentioned in the
introduction, but we reserve judgement on this possibil-
ity until more experimental verication is available.

2. one massless quark, no massless neutrinos. there
has been quite a bit of discussion in the literature re-
garding the mass of the u-quark and the possibility of it
vanishing (e.g. [911]). it seems that there is currently
no phenomenological result which necessarily excludes
the possibility of mu = 0. a massless u-quark would
also be interesting from the point of view of the strong
cp problem. a massless quark would allow for a chiral
transformation to be made which could rotate away the
coecient of the instanton term in the qcd lagrangian
[12,13].

our analysis has shown that ncg requires that n1 6=
n2, so we may take all neutrinos to be massive if we are
willing to take mu = 0. chiral perturbation theory may
be used to extract relations for the ratios of quark masses,
but at second order there is an an ambiguity which allows
for an eective u-quark mass contribution on the order
of the d-quark mass, which would exactly imitate a real
u-quark mass term [9]. we note that our calculations are
in disagreement with the claim of [5] that the mu = 0
possibility is excluded within ncg.

3. a new neutrino. for completeness we mention an-
other possibility.
if we take all of the neutrino exper-
iments seriously, not even three massive neutrinos are
enough to explain via oscillations all of the observed ef-
fects [1]. one possible solution is then to include a new
neutrino in the model. this option is severely limited by
the experimental measurement of the z width, which is
consistent with 2.993  0.011 light neutrino types [14].
we can avoid conict with this result, though, by intro-
ducing a neutrino which does not couple in the usual way
to the weak gauge bosonsa type of sterile neutrino, as
was introduced in [15,16]. the eects of such an inclusion
would depend on the details of the model and the result-
ing modication to the matrix q. it has been shown in
[17] that ncg does not allow for the inclusion of ma-
jorana fermions, excluding many of the sterile neutrino
models which have been studied.

v. conclusion

in its ncg setting, the sm, while quite constrained
[18], does allow for certain extensions which include mas-
sive neutrinos and therefore neutrino oscillations. of the
possible extensions discussed, the most appealing is that
in which all neutrinos are massive and the u-quark is
massless to ensure poincare duality. the idea of a mass-
less u-quark as a solution to the strong cp problem is
often thrown out as being unnatural, but in ncg we
see that it may be quite natural after all.

the case in which one neutrino is massless allows for

3

two independent oscillation lengths, based on our argu-
ment that neutrino oscillations may between massive and
massless eigenstates. the sterile neutrino solution is an
interesting one which should be explored further in the
context of ncg.
