abstract

we consider chern-simons gauged nonlinear sigma model with boundary
which has a manifest bulk dieomorphism invariance. we nd that the gausss
law can be solved explicitly when the nonlinear sigma model is dened on the
hermitian symmetric space, and the original bulk theory completely reduces
to a boundary nonlinear sigma model with the target space of hermitian
symmetric space. we also study the symplectic structure, compute the dif-
feomorphism algebra on the boundary, and nd an (enlarged) virasoro algebra
with classical central term.

i. introduction

the chern-simons (cs) gravity theory [1] with boundary [2] has attracted a lot of recent
attention in relation with black hole physics [3]. in particular, it has been observed [4] that
the virasoro algebra which lives on the boundary and carries classical central charge [57]
may provide important clues in understanding the microscopic origin of black hole entropy.
it is well known that in the chern-simons theory [8], the gauss constraint can be solved
explicitly by the pure gauge condition, and the bulk theory completely reduces to a boundary
chiral wzw model on g [9]. if one imposes some extra condition on the group element,
reduction from the target space of g to that of g/h occurs [10]. for example, if one imposes
an extra condition like g2 = 1, cp (n) nonlinear sigma model (nlsm) can be obtained.
however, such process is ad hoc and the reduced theory on cp (n) has some properties
which cannot be obtained from the original wzw theory by simply substituting g2 = 1
(the enlarged virasoro algebra of eq. (29) is one such example.). the purpose of this letter
is to invent some scheme where the reduction to g/h occurs directly as a consequence
of gauss law constraint. using the coadjoint orbit method for nlsm [11], we introduce
a model in which the chern-simons gauge eld and nlsm on g/h have topological and
gauge invariant interaction. gausss law can be solved explicitly when the nlsm is dened
on the hermitian symmetric spaces, and the original bulk theory completely reduces to a
boundary nlsm with the target space of hermitian symmetric space. we also study the
symplectic structure of the boundary theory and compute the dieomorphism algebra by
the standard noether procedure. we nd that the dieomorphism algebra becomes the
virasoro algebra with classical central term if a suitable boundary condition is satised. we
also discover an enlarged virasoro algebra with elements of symmetric tensor product.

ii. symplectic reduction and boundary nlsm

to describe the coupling of cs theory with nlsm, we introduce a coadjoint orbit variable
q = gkg1 on g/h, where g  g and k  h is the centralizer for the lie algebra h. then,
we consider the chern-simons theory coupled with nlsm in a dieomorphism invariant
manner on the disc d

(1)

where h  i denotes trace and d =  + a. since we are interested in a complete reduction
to the boundary theory, we neglect the metric dependent part of the lagrangian for the
variable q and consider only the manifest dieomorphism-invariant theory. the above
lagrangian also has the gauge invariance

(h  g),

solution of the gausss law constraint. the lagrangian also has a local symmetry g 
gh (h  h), q  q, a  a, which makes the eld q to take values in the homogeneous
space g/h. up to a boundary term, (1) can be put into the following canonical form

we shall take (3) as our starting point. variation with respect to aa

0 gives the gauss
law constraint ga
ij = 0. we adopt the hamiltonian symplectic method [12] and solve the
constraint from the beginning. it turns out that the above constraint can be solved explicitly
when q corresponds to hermitian symmetric spaces [13,11] with the following ansatz;

aa

i = c[q, iq]a,

(5)

where c is a constant to be determined. substituting into (4) and using the identities
[q, [q, iq]] = iq,
[q, [iq, jq]] = 0 which are satised [11] on hermitian symmetric
spaces, we nd that the constraint can be solved by choosing

c = 1  q1/(1 + 2).

( >

)

(6)

when  = 0, c can be either 0 or 2. in the latter case, aa
i = 2[q, iq]a satises the zero
curvature condition which in su(2) case has been studied before in the context of vacuum
structure of pure yang-mills theory [14] and in integrable models [11]. substitution into the
lagrangian (3) gives

l =  i d < q q >,

(7)

where  denotes the angular coordinate on the boundary d of disc d and  = c(2)1(c+
2(1 + c)). hence, the bulk theory has completely reduced to boundary theory upon sub-
stitution of the solution of the gauss law constraint [15].

in order to compute the symplectic structure, we follow the approach of ref. [16] to
 = [q, q]a. using the

rewrite the lagrangian in terms of the current dened by j a
identities [q, [q, q]] = q, we obtain

l = i d < j[q, q] > .

which suggests the following canonical 1-form

 = i d < j[q, dq] > .

(8)

(9)

then, using [q, [dq, dq]] = 0, we obtain (introducing the q and j  as the matrix element
of q and j)

 = d

(10)

where

;(, ) = 2(cid:16)q + q(cid:17) (  ).

(11)

introducing the tensor notation (a  b); = ab, we have  = 2(q  i  i  q).
the notation is to be understood as including the dirac delta-function. also, in order to
simplify the calculation, we transform the original q  g into q2 = i/4 which always can
be achieved by a suitable addition of constant [11]. note that adding a constant to q does
not change the action (7), the current j a

, and the symplectic structure (11).

in general, the presymplectic form  of (10) and (11) is degenerate and we must calculate
the poisson bracket on the reduced phase space. in order to achieve this, we introduce the
projection operator p and the inverse 1 which is dened on the reduced phase space, and
satisfy the following relations [17]

1 = i  i  p,

p 2 = p,

p  = 1p = 0.

using  = 2(q  i  i  q), we nd the following solution of the above equation

1 =

1
2

(i  q  q  i), p =

1
2

(i  i  4q  q).

the above analysis yields the following poisson bracket

{j (), q()} = 1

;(, ) =

1
2 (cid:16)q  q(cid:17) (  ),

or in generator form

{j a

(), qb()} = f abcqc()(  ).

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

then, we compute the bracket {j a
respect to the interchange of (a, )  (b, ), we calculate

(), j b

()}. in order to properly antisymmetrize with

{j a

where  = / and we dened the symmetric tensor product

j ab() = f acef bdeqc()qd().

also, one can show, using the jacobi identities for the structure constants,

{j a

(), j bc()} = (cid:16)f abdj dc() + f acdj bd()(cid:17) (  ).

j a and j bc form an enlarged current algebra. this type of current algebra ((16) (17) (18) )
rst appeared in the analysis of o(n) nonlinear sigma model through the dirac constraint
analysis [18]. later, it was generalized to arbitrary riemannian manifolds with uncon-
strained variables using the killing symmetry [19].

iii. diffeomorphism algebra

we rst compute dieomorphism (di) algebra directly from the action (7). under

dieomorphism f qa = f qa, f l = 0, and the noether charge becomes

c(f ) =

l
 qa

f qa = 1 id

df  < jj >,

(19)

where one used 2 < qq >=< jj >.
expression of (16) from here on;

it is more convenient to use the matrix

{j (), j ()} =

2 (cid:18)1


2

 + q()q() + q()q()(cid:19)  (  ),

(20)

then, a straight forward computation produces the virasoro algebra without a central charge

{c(f ), c(g)} = c([f, g]).

(21)

where [f, g] = f g  f g .

the above derivation of the virasoro started directly from the reduced action on the
boundary. however, one can also rst compute di charge from the bulk action (3) by the
noether procedure, and then reduce it to a boundary di charge using the solution (5).
as in the pure chern-simons case, the ensuing algebra depends on the boundary condition
[6,16]. we show that with a suitable choice of boundary condition, di algebra becomes
the virasoro algebra with classical central term. let us start with the lagrangian (3) and
consider the response of l to a spatial and time-independent dieomorphism:

if i, f qa = f jjqa,

f x = 
f aa
f aa

i = f jjaa
i + (if j)aa
j ,
0 = f jjaa
0.

we nd that

in order to have di invariance, we must have f l = d

the rst one is to choose f r|d = 0 so that x = 0. this boundary condition results in

di only along the circle (d). the noether charge for this di becomes

where in the second line we imposed the constraint ga
ij = 0 and its solution (5). note that
the above equation is the same as eq. (19), and we again get the virasoro algebra without
central charge. the second boundary condition corresponds to extending the solution (5) in
the bulk to the boundary with an extra condition ar = c[q, rq]|d=constant [20]. then,
the last line vanishes in (23), and it becomes dx
[q, rq]=constant). after calculating the noether charge, and imposing the solution, we
get

+2[f rgr  f rgr](< jrqjrq > +

(25)

(26)

in general, this bracket does not satisfy the jacobi identity for arbitrary f r. one possible
choice which satises the jacobi identity is given by f r|d  f |d and gr|d  g|d
(we choose the proportionality constant equal to 1) along with the condition that j a
r =
[q, rq]a= constant. then, the above equation (26) becomes the virasoro algebra with
classical central term;

{c(f ), c(g)} = c([f, g]) 

< jrjr >



id

d (f g  f g ) .

(27)

thus, in contrast to the di along the circle (d), di which deforms across the boundary
yields the virasoro algebra with the classical third order derivative central term. this is
similar to what happens in the pure chern-simons theory [6,16].

the above results also suggest that an enlarged virasoro algebra can be constructed. let
us consider the expression (25) directly on the boundary with some constant jr. then the
< jrqjrq > term in (26) does not become constant, and we must choose f r|d  f |d
and gr|d  g|d in order to satisfy the jacobi identity. this motivates introducing the
elements of symmetric tensor product of qs dened by

s(f ) = j 

r j 
s;(f ) = 21 id

r s;(f ),

df ()(q  q);,

and postulating the following enlarged virasoro algebra;

{c(f ), c(g)} = c([f, g]) + s([f, g]) + k id

d (f g  f g ) ,

{c(f ), s(g)} = s((f g)),

{s(f ), s(g)} = 0,

(28)

(29)

where k=constant. the third order derivative central charge has been put in by hand and
the above algebra satises the jacobi identity. it is to be remarked that even if the poisson

5

bracket does not carry the central term classically, one can explicitly show that it arises
from the standard quantum mechanical normal ordering [21] of c and s. the chiral nlsm
on the boundary has a central term with only rst order derivative in (26). it would be
interesting to nd some explicit model in which the enlarged virasoro algebra (29) can be
realized classically.

iv. conclusion

we have constructed a boundary model in which the chern-simons gauge eld and
nlsm have bulk topological interaction with a manifest gauge invariance. we showed that
the modied gausss law can be solved explicitly when the nlsm is dened on the hermitian
symmetric space, and the original bulk theory reduces to a boundary nlsm which has a
time-independent dieomorphism invariance. we nd the coadjoint orbit method for nlsm
particularly convenient in the process. we also calculated the symplectic structure and the
dieomorphism algebra. if we rst calculate the di charge directly from the bulk action
by the noether procedure, and then reduce it to a boundary di charge using the solution
of gausss law constraint, the ensuing di algebra which corresponds to deformation across
the boundary yields the virasoro algebra with classical central term. we also discovered an
enlarged virasoro algebra with elements of symmetric tensor product of qs. it would be
interesting to study the enlarged virasoro algebra in detail, and to investigate whether the
present result can nd some application in the black hole physics.
