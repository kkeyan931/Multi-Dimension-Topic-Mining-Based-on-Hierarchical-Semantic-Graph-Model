abstract

the path-integral of the fermionic oscillator with a time-dependent frequency is ana-
lyzed. we give the exact relation between the boundary condition to dene the domain in
which the path-integral is performed and the transition amplitude that the path-integral
calculates. according to this relation, the amplitude suppressed by a zero mode does not
indicate any special dynamics, unlike the analogous situation in eld theories. it simply
says the path-integral picks up a combination of the amplitudes that vanishes. the zero
mode that is often neglected in the reason of not being normalizable is necessary to obtain
the correct answer for the propagator and to avoid an anomaly on the fermion number.
we give a method to obtain the fermionic determinant by the determinant of a simple
2  2 matrix, which enables us to calculate it for a variety of boundary conditions.

fermionic determinant of the operator d is the one we rst encounter in the analysis of
the quantum physics in the path-integral formalism. it is the exact result of the grassmann
path-integral made from a bilinear lagrangian d over the fermionic degrees of freedom 
and . the determinant carries an important information about the time evolution of the

fermions under the inuence of bosonic background. especially when d or its adjoint d
has a zero mode, the zero-frequency eigenmode of the operator, the determinant vanishes and

corresponding transition is suppressed. a typical example of such situation happens with d the
dirac operator in su(2) gauge theory. it possesses zero modes in the instanton background. the

consequent suppression of the transition is interpreted to reect the fermion number violation

due to the anomaly on the fermion current [1].

1

the physical signicance of the zero modes of dirac operators was rst advocated in ref. [2]

and has been discussed in various places in physics. we still notice there seems to be a confusion

on the treatment of zero modes in the case of fermionic oscillator, the simplest system containing
only one fermionic degree of freedom. its lagrangian d in imaginary time formalism is given
by a simple rst order dierential operator

d =

d
d

+ v( )

(1)

with respect to the imaginary time  , where v( ) is the time-dependent angular frequency

induced by a coupling to a bosonic degree of freedom. we also dene

d = 

d
d

+ v( ).

(2)

assume v( ) changes its sign along the evolution in the time interval [t /2, t /2], for example,
as v( ) = tanh( ). the solution of d = 0 is then regarded as the zero mode since it is
normalizable in the limit of t  . gildener and patrascioiu have argued by an explicit
calculation that there is no zero mode available in the determinant calculus even in this simple

example [3], while salomonson and van holten have taken advantage of the zero mode in their

calculation for the supersymmetry breaking [4].

in addition to the question of the existence of zero mode, we are concerned that the fermionic

oscillator would have an anomaly if the numbers of the zero modes of d and d are dierent. in
the simple example mentioned above, the solution of d = 0 is not thought to be the relevant
for suciently large t , it becomes zero almost everywhere when normalized to
zero mode:

one. thus there appears to be the asymmetry in the numbers. according to the path-integral

formulation of the anomaly [5], this asymmetry induces a phase in the path-integral measure
under the global phase transformation,   ei and   ei , which indicates the non-
conservation of the fermion number. this contradicts our naive intuition, that the fermionic

oscillator should have no anomaly since we can calculate any amplitude with no regularization.

2

motivated by this question of zero mode, we will clarify in this letter the exact calculation of

the path-integral of the fermionic oscillator. in doing the path-integral, we rst prepare an or-

thonormal complete set for all possible congurations. the eigenmodes of a certain self-adjoint

operator are known to constitute such a complete set. the useful choice for the calculation is

to use the dierential expressions dd and dd as the candidate for the operator. as is known
in mathematics, we need to impose the boundary condition to make the dierential expressions

to be self-adjoint. the important observation found in this letter is that the path-integral

represents a dierent transition amplitude if the boundary condition is dierent. we will give

the exact relation between the boundary condition and the transition amplitude, and verify it

by comparing the path-integral results with those obtained by the operator formalism. the

suppression for the zero mode will be understood within this boundary condition dependence.

we rst carry out the calculation in the operator formalism. the hamiltonian of the

oscillator is

where  and  are the annihilation and creation operators in the two-dimensional space

h( ) = v( )

1

2 (cid:16)  (cid:17) ,

(3)

spanned by vacant |0i and occupied |1i states,

|0i = |1i = 0, |1i = |0i, |0i = |1i.

(4)

from this hamiltonian, the evolution operator from the initial time ti to the nal tf is obtained

by

u(tf , ti) = t exp"z tf

ti

dh()# ,

(5)

where t represents the time-ordered product. the hamiltonian commutes with the fermion
number operator , and it is obvious that the matrix elements of u are written as

h0|u(tf , ti)|0i = exp" 1

2 z tf

ti

d v( )# ,

h1|u(tf , ti)|1i = exp"

1

2 z tf

ti

d v( )# ,

(6)

and two o-diagonal ones equal to zero. these are all we have to know to obtain any transition

amplitude.

3

we turn to the path-integral formalism and consider

i = z [d d] exp"z t /2

t /2

d d# ,

(7)

where the functional measure is dened by discretizing imaginary-time [6]. we will come back

this point later. eq. (7) is related to the matrix elements of u(t /2,t /2). before seeing it,
let us proceed the calculation of eq. (7) usually adopted in literatures. the most decent way

of the calculation for non-hermitian d such as the one in the present case is to choose the
domains d and d of the square-integrable functions in the interval [t /2, t /2], in which
dd and dd are self-adjoint and positive semi-denite, and the non-zero eigenmodes have
the one-to-one correspondence (see for example [5]). the normalized eigenmodes (n)( d)
and (n)( d) (n = 1, 2, 3, ....),

dd(n) = n(n), dd(n) = n(n),

constitute a complete orthonormal set and they are related by

1

nd(n) = (n),

1

nd(n) = (n),

(8)

(9)

except zero modes. the eigenvalues so obtained are non negative. using the expansions with

these eigenmodes,

( ) = xn

an(n)( ),

we employ the integration measure [dan dan] instead of [d  d] and obtain

( ) = xn

an(n)( ),

i = n z [dada]epn

nanan = n hdet(dd)i1/2

,

(10)

(11)

where n is the jacobian between the measures, det(dd) is the innite product of the eigenval-
ues. the latter is well-dened in the combination with n . a dierent background v( ) results
in a dierent complete set and dierent amplitudes in eq. (10), say bn and bn. the jacobian

between the measures [dada] and [dbdb] is the determinant of the matrix that represents the

4

linear transformation between the eigenmodes in the dierent sets. since each set is complete

and orthonormal anyway, the matrix is unitary and the jacobian is a phase. thus background
dependence of n in (11) can be at most a phase factor1. in the explicit examples adopted in
later calculations, however, we can choose the eigenmodes as real function of  . this is because

either the dierential equations (8) or boundary conditions (see eqs. (26) and (27)) to solve the

eigenvalue problem does not have any imaginary variable or constant. thus the phase factor

is 1 or 1. the jacobian n then becomes background-independent except a possibility that it
changes the sign at some special background.

although the dierential expression dd or dd seems self-adjoint by its form, it is not
immediately so. one needs to dene the domains d and d properly in the functional space

by imposing the boundary condition. we notice that any 1 and 2 in d should obey

2(t /2)d1(t /2)  2(t /2)d1(t /2) = 0.

under the usual denition of the inner product,

(2, 1)  z t /2

t /2

d 2( )1( ),

(12)

(13)

eq. (12) means (2,dd1) = (d2,d1) which guarantees that dd is non-negative, and
leads to (2,dd1) = (dd2, 1) which holds if it is self-adjoint. note also that the equation

z t /2

t /2

d d = z t /2

t /2

d (d ).

(14)

holds as far as we expand  and  as in (10) with  and  that obey (9). this equation means

that any   d and any   d satisfy

(t /2)(t /2)  (t /2)(t /2) = 0.

(15)

since d  d if   d, eq. (12) and (15) are equivalent.

1the procedure described here has a greater advantage in this property than the direct use of the eigenmodes

of non self-adjoint d as was done in ref. [3].

5

in fact the mathematical theory of the self-adjoint extension of the dierential expression

tells us that we need to specify two linearly independent boundary conditions on the values,

(t /2) and (t /2) in the present case of
(t /2) and (t /2), and the rst derivatives,
the second order dierential expression. we refer the readers to the mathematical textbook [7]

about the details. the problem is that the boundary condition so obtained is not unique. then

there naturally occurs a question about the boundary condition dependence of the path-integral.

to see the boundary condition dependence, we review the derivation of eq. (7) based on

ref. [6]. we prepare the states

|i  |0i + |1i,

h|  h0| + h1|

making use of grassmann numbers  and . they satisfy the completeness relation,

z dd(1  )|ih| = |0ih0| + |1ih1|.

(16)

(17)

the path-integral (7) calculates the evolution from |0i to |ni, hn|u|0i, where we have
abbreviated u(t /2,t /2) to u. to evaluate this, we discretize the time interval into n
segments, each of which has the length  = t /n and write u as

u = lim

nt   n
yn=1

(1  h(n))! ,

(18)

where n = n t /2. we insert (n  1) pairs of grassmann integrals of (n, n)(n = 1, ..., n 
1) in the form of the completeness relation (17) as the (n  1) junctions of the n factors
(1  h(n))(n = 1, ..., n). using the explicit form (3) and (4), we obtain
hn|u|0i = lim

(20)

and can be safely replaced with

exp(i"  i  i1



! + v(i)  i + i1

2

!#)

(21)

because 2

i = 0 and r di = 0. then we arrive at a very close expression to eq. (7) when we

regard n as (n) and n as (n). note, however, a dierence of the rst bracket factor in

eq. (19) from the others. we also wonder where n and 0 have gone when we got the result

(11).

these questions are solved naturally by assuming that the exact denition of the measure

[d d] in eq. (7), corresponding to the way we have integrated it out, does include the integral

over n and 0 as

i  z dn dn (1  n n )hn|u|0i

(22)

where 0 and n are related by the boundary condition to make dd and dd self-adjoint.
the relevant terms in the integrand in (22) is those quadratic in the grassmann variables,

(1  n n )hn|u|0i = ...  n nh0|u|0i + n 0h1|u|1i + ...

this shows

i = h0|u|0i + h1|u|1i

if the boundary conditions imposed to dene d is 0 + n = 0, or equivalently

(t /2) + (t /2) = 0.

(23)

(24)

(25)

eqs. (24) and (25) are consistent with the fact that the fermionic path-integral presents the

trace of u when carried out in the anti-periodic congurations ( = 1).

7

we verify eq. (24) by explicitly calculating the determinant det(dd) at various boundary

conditions. the boundary conditions we are interested in is written as

(t /2) + (t /2) = 0,

d(t /2) + d(t /2) = 0,

and

(t /2) + (t /2) = 0, d(t /2) + d(t /2) = 0,

(26)

(27)

with a real parameter . this condition includes the periodic one at  = 1 as well as the
anti-periodic at 1. it is also available for the domain in which the zero mode lives. once we

put the boundary condition on , eq. (12) and the one-one correspondence between  and 

determine the conditions on d, , and d. the operators dd and dd are proved to be
self-adjoint under these boundary conditions [7]. to calculate det(dd), the 2  2 matrix

m(z)    u1(z;t /2) + u1(z; t /2)

du1(z;t /2) + du1(z; t /2) du2(z;t /2) + du2(z; t /2) !

u2(z;t /2) + u2(z; t /2)

(28)

plays the central role, where ui(z;  ) (i = 1, 2) are the linearly independent solutions of the

equation

ddui(z;  ) = zui(z;  )

and the parameter z is complex in general. we x the normalization of these solutions by

u1(z;t /2) = 1
u1(z;t /2) = 0

u2(z;t /2) = 0
u2(z;t /2) = 1.

(29)

(30)

note the dierential equation (29) does not have the rst derivative term. thus the wronskian

(u1 u2  u1u2) conserves and is equal to 1 at any  . the zero points of det m coincide with the
eigenvalues of dd: if  is one of the eigenvalues, there exists a non-trivial linear combination
1u1(;  ) + 2u2(;  ) that satises eq. (26); the equation for i turns out to be

m()ij j = 0 (i, j = 1, 2) and thus det m(z) is zero at the eigenvalue ; one can reverse this

argument in the opposite direction.

8

we then see the ratio [det(dd  z)/ det m(z)] is independent from the background v( ).
the proof is essentially the same as the one given in ref. [8] in the calculation of the other type
of determinants. let us consider two dierent operators d1d1 and d2d2 containing dierent
backgrounds v1( ) and v2( ), and denote their n-th eigenvalue by 1;n and 2;n, respectively.
correspondingly let m1 and m2 denote the matrix made by (28) and (29) with d1d1 and d2d2,
respectively. the ratio dened by

det(d1d1  z)
det(d2d2  z) 



yn=1 1;n  z
2;n  z!

(31)

is a meromorphic function of z, and it has a simple zero at each 1;n and a simple pole at each

2;n. it goes to one as z goes to innity in any direction except along the real positive axis. the

ratio [det m1(z)/ det m2(z)] is also a meromorphic function that has poles and zeros at exactly

the same z. note further we obtain

det m(z) = du2(z; t /2) + 2 [u1(z; t /2)  v(t /2)u2(z; t /2)] + 2

(32)

using the condition (30) and the conservation of the wronskian. for suciently large |z|,
q|z|  |v( )2  v( )|t , the frequency v( ) in (29) becomes negligible. the solutions ui(z;  )
is then well-approximated by their free solutions, and u2(t /2)  u1(t /2)  ezt /2. the
determinant of m then grows as (1 + 2)ezt /2 at suciently large |z| (except along the real

positive axis) independently from the backgrounds. the ratio [det m1(z)/ det m2(z)] also goes

to one in the same limit. thus

det(d1d1  z)
det(d2d2  z)

=

det m1(z)
det m2(z)

.

eq. (33) establishes that [det(dd  z)/ det m(z)] is background independent.

we can now write2

(33)

(34)

2similar formulae that relate the determinant of dierential operators with that of a matrix have been found

n [det(dd)]1/2 = n  [det m(0)]1/2 .

in condensed matter physics [9].

9

the factor n  is background independent as is n . the calculation of det m(0) is elementary.
we obtain

u1(0;  ) = x1( ) + v(t /2)x2( ),

u2(0;  ) = x2( ),

(35)

where

x1( ) = exp"z 

t /2

dv()# ,

y1( ) = exp"z 

t /2

dv()# ,

x2( ) = x1( )z 

t /2

putting these solutions into (32), we nd

det m(0) = (cid:16)[y1(t /2)]1/2 + [x1(t /2)]1/2(cid:17)2

.

note y1 = (x1)1. recalling eqs. (11), (34), and (37), we obtain

i = n n[y1(t /2)]1/2 + [x1(t /2)]1/2o .

d (y1())2 .

(36)

(37)

(38)

this is exactly eq. (24), where the matrix elements are calculated explicitly by eqs. (6) and

(36). the factor n  turns out to be 1. we like to make a comment here. i in eq. (38) becomes
negative, for example, when  = 1 and x1(t /2) > y1(t /2). it means that we have chosen
the negative solution in taking the square-root of det m in this case. this choice is justied by

considering that i should be analytic with respect to the functional variation of v( ). the ow
of n that appears in (9) and (11) must be smooth when the background changes continuously.
we are prepared to answer the question of zero mode. note that the zero mode candidate is

x1 or y1 in (36). let us start with assuming that the normalizable one in the usual sense is x1.

the domain in which x1 resides is given by the boundary condition (26) with  = y1(t /2).
now that zero is an eigenvalue, the path-integral is zero. this is readily veried by putting the

value of  into (38). the reason of the vanishing amplitude is, however, quite dierent from

our interpretation of the same occurrence in the su(2) gauge theory. there is no dynamical

reason; we have just chosen a vanishing combination accidentally by the boundary conditions.

we also notice the other zero solution y1 cannot be neglected.

it satises the boundary

condition eq. (27) with the same value of . since we can normalize it any way as long as

10

the time interval t is nite (no matter how long it is), we cannot nd any legitimate reason

to abandon it. we can conrm the necessity of y1 in the calculation of the propagator. let us

dene

f (, )  (  )u(t /2,  )u(, )u(,t /2)

(   )u(t /2, )u(,  )u(,t /2),

and consider its path-integral representation

g(, ) = z [d d] exp"z t /2

t /2

d d# ( ) ().

(39)

(40)

the exact relation of g integrated in the domain dened by eqs. (26) and (27) to the corre-

sponding matrix element of f is obtained by applying the same argument that leads to eq. (24).

it is

g(, ) = (  )h0|u(t /2,  )u(, )u(,t /2)|0i

+(   ) y1(t /2)h1|u(t /2, )u(,  )u(,t /2)|1i.

(41)

in the operator formalism, eqs. (4) and (6) yield

h0|u(t /2,  )u(, )u(,t /2)|0i = y1(t /2)1/2x1( )y1(),
h1|u(t /2,  )u(,  )u(,t /2)|1i = x1(t /2)1/2x1( )y1(),

and, thus, using eq. (41) we obtain

g(, ) = y1(t /2)1/2x1( )y1().

(42)

(43)

interestingly the nal result does not have any remnant of the time-ordered procedure in (41).

we do the corresponding path-integral (40). the normalized zero modes are

(1)( ) =

x1( )

sz t /2

t /2

d x1()2

, (1)( ) =

y1( )

sz t /2

t /2

d y1()2

.

(44)

11

the grassmann variables a1 and a1 in the expansion (10), the coecients of (1) and (1), do

not appear in the action. only the  and  in the integrand in (40) can supply them, and one

gets

g(, ) = n hdet (dd)i1/2

(1)( )(1)(),

where det (dd) is the product of the eigenvalues except zero. it is evaluated by

n 2 det (dd) = lim
z0

det m(z)

(z)

.

(45)

(46)

for the calculation of the right-hand side in eq. (46), we use the fact that the solutions

ui(z;  )(i = 1, 2) have an expansion around z = 0,

ui(z;  ) = ui(0;  ) + z ui( ) + ...

and the rst order term is given by

ui( ) = z 

t /2

d [u1(0;  )u2(0; )  u2(0;  )u1(0; )] ui(0; ).

(47)

(48)

since ui(t /2) =  ui(t /2) = 0, the expansion (47) satises the initial conditions (30).
putting eqs. (47) and (48) into eq. (32) and using eqs. (35) and (36), we obtain

lim
z0

det m(z)

(z)

= y1(t /2) "z t /2

t /2

d y1( )2#"z t /2

t /2

d x1( )2# .

(49)

eqs. (44), (45), (46) and (49) give the correct result (43). we would have a wrong answer

without (1). the numbers of the zero mode belonging to d and d are the same independently

of the specic boundary condition to dene them. this is consistent with the absence of the

anomaly in the fermionic oscillator.

in summary, we have revealed and conrmed that the path-integral in dierent boundary

conditions calculates dierent matrix elements of the time evolution operator. the exact rela-

tion between the boundary condition and the matrix element tells us the reason of vanishing

path-integral by the zero mode.

it does not have a dynamical reason such as the fermion

12

number violation, but it occurs just because the zero mode takes the vanishing combination of

the matrix elements. one may wonder whether the boundary condition dependence vanishes

in the limit of t  . it does not vanish. for example, the path-integral with the periodic
boundary condition can be either positive or negative depending on the background, while that

with the anti-periodic one is always positive no matter what the background is. it is natural to

expect the existence of the similar boundary condition dependence in eld theories. then any

conclusion based on a path-integral calculation should be spelled out with the boundary condi-

tion, with respect to the imaginary time, explicitly specied. the conclusion might change for

dierent boundary conditions. as far as we know there is little discussion on this dependence.

a careful investigation of eld theories taking consciously boundary conditions into account

may reveal their new aspects.
