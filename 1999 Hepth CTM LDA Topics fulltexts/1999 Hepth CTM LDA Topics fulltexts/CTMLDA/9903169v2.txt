1 introduction

recently, there was a lot of interest to string theories on ads, and on other manifolds
with boundaries, [1]-[5] and to their relationship to yang mills quantum eld theories
on the boundary. string theory on ads has a symmetry group, corresponding to
isometries of target space, whose bosonic part is so(1, n). there should be conserved
noether currents corresponding to such symmetries. also, such string theories should
be described by conformal eld theories. usually, when there are conserved currents
in a conformal eld theory, those currents give rise to a kac-moody algebra, the space
of states in such conformal theory are in highest weight modules of the kac moody
algebra, and the virasoro algebra comes via sugawara construction [6]. namely, the
currents are (closed) one forms on the world sheet ja(.)dx, the integrals of which
over paths gives conserved charges, with values in lie algebra; and equal time
commutation relations of currents should be such as to reproduce the lie algebra
commutators of charges; if we integrate the current over a path  on world sheet with
weights (),   , and use commutation relations for currents, we will get

[z

 jad,z

 jbd] = f abcz   jcd + kz d;

and in particular, taking a closed path, parametrised by , and ,  of the form
ein, we get that fourier coecients of currents satisfy commutation relations of a
kac-moody algebra.

in our case, the algebra is so(1, n), which is a real form of a complex algebra;
still it can be promoted to a kac-moody-like loop algebra in the usual way; it is
generated by ei r p (s), with ei  so(1, n), p (s) laurent polynomials, and the
bracket [ei  p (s), ej  g(s)] = [ei, ej]  p (s)g(s) + k (ei, ej) res dp
ds q, where (ei, ej)
is an invariant symmetric form on so(1, n); this form is not positive-denite. highest
weight module for such loop algebra is not unitary.

if we think about boundary states, those associated with the boundary of world
sheet disk, there are two possible candidates for representations: one non-unitary
highest weight, and another unitary, not highest weight. usually, for bulk states,
representation ought to be highest weight ones, because otherwise, applying a current
to a state, we get too singular result; however, its probably not so for boundary states
living on a circle, as functions {ein} on a circle, unlike functions {zn} at the origin,
are equally good for positive or negative n. since boundary states may have something
to do with our world, more so then bulk ones, its nice to have some unitarity; as that
things seem to be pretty unitary in our world. thus the purpose of this note is to
examine the unitary, not highest weight representations, using whatever is natural
from representation theory.

we do not put any supersymmetry here, since its simpler, and we have to get rid

2

of supersymmetry in the end of the day anyway; as we are dealing with just a repre-
sentation theory, not with a full string theory, it causes no problems to concentrate
on the bosonic sector. we do not have here a central extension of the current algebra,
so k = 0 (see [2], [3] for a relevant discussion in supersymmetric case), for reasons
mostly technical.

2 unitary irreducible representation of dso(1, n) loop

algebra and unitary action of operators in uni-
versal enveloping algebra

2.1 hilbert space

the loop algebra cso(1, n) has an interesting unitary, non-highest weight irreducible
2 = 1 with integral zero, z (x)dx = 0, and with the scalar product

representation, which we believe is important and which we describe below. consider
2 + . . . +
the hilbert space h of real valued functions (x) on a sphere sn: x1
xn

2 + x2

h, i =z z (x)(x ) ln (1  (x, x )) dxdx 

(1)

we can introduce the hilbert space h for maps (x, s) from s1 into h, with the scalar
product

<(), ()> =is 1

dsz z (x, s)(x , s) ln (1  (x, x )) dxdx 

we introduce bosonic fock space f of symmetric tensor products f =lm hm, which

is also a hilbert space; its enough to give scalar product

h()m , ()mi = m! h() , ()im

(2)

it is easy to compute other scalar products in fock space of symmetric tensor powers
of h, for example

1

(m2)! 1  2  (m2),

< 1
(m2)! ( <1, 1> <2, > + <2, 1> <1, > ) <, > m2+
+ 1

(m3)! ( <1, > <2, > <, 1> ) <, > m3

1

(m1)! 1  (m1)> =

we also introduce exp(()) in a completion of f,

exp((x(s)) = 1 +

xm=1

1
m!

(x(s))m

hexp(()), exp(())i = exp (h(), ()i)

2.2 unitary irreducible representation of loop algebra cso(1, n)

via rst order dierential operators acting on exp h

we consider maps s1  g from a circle into the lie algebra so(1, n), with the point-
wise lie bracket,

{i1, i2} (s) = {i1(s), i2(s)}

(5)

this lie algebra cso(1, n) is given by generators and relations

{iij(f (s)), ikl(g(s))} = jkiil(f g(s))  jliik(f g(s)) + ilijk(f g(s))  ikijl(f g(s))

{iij(f (s)), ik,0(g(s))} = jkii,0(f g(s))  ikij,0(f g(s))

{ii,0(f (s)), ij,0(g(s))} = ii,j(f g(s))

a unitary irreducible representation is given by

(6)

t [i(f (s))]exp ((x(s))) = (d[i] + [i]  < [i], (x, s) > ) exp ((x(s))) (7)

where d is a derivation, which satisfy leibnitz rule, and are skew-adjoint operators
in h:

d[iij(f (s))] (x(s)) = f (s) (xij  xji)) (x, s),

d[ii,0(f (s))] (x(s)) = f (s) (i  xi(x)  (n  1)xi) (x, s),

d[ii,0(f (s))] 1 = 0,

and

[iij(f (s))] = 0

[ii,0(f (s))] = (n  1)f (s)i(x),

(8)

(9)

where i(x) is a function on a sphere equal to the i-th coordinate, i(x) = xi.

 is a one-cocycle,

d[i1][i2]  d[i2][i2] = [ {i1, i2} ]

(10)

it is easy to verify directly that the operators of the representation are skew

adjoint. it can be shown that the representation is irreducible.

2.3 unitary action of universal enveloping algebra in

(f exp h)

it is easy to check, that if we want to represent elements of universal enveloping
algebra by dierential operators acting on our hilbert space of functions, we are
forced to have that t [i1i2] cannot be equal to just t [i1]t [i2], since the right hand
side does not satisfy the commutation relations of our lie algebra, and also we are
loosing skew-adjoint property for t [i1] in the right hand side. as some computation
shows, it is possible to correct both problems at once, as we show below.

we will write explicitly polynomials of degree up to 3:
in degree 2, skew-symmetry means that

< exp(()) , t [ i1(f (s)) i2(g(s)) ] exp(())> =

 < t [i1(f (s))] exp(()) , t [i2(g(s))] exp((x, s))> ,

and the relations are

(t [i1(f (s)) i2(g(s))]  t [i2(g(s)) i1(f (s))] ) exp((x, s)) =
t [ {i1(f (s)), i2(g(s))} ] exp((x, s))

(11)

(12)

from this we can deduce how to write a second degree dierential operator, rep-
resenting polynomials of degree 2 in generators of lie algebra by unitary operators:

t [i1(f (s)) i2(g(s))] exp((x, s)) =

=(cid:16) (d[i1] + [i1]  < [i1], () > ) (d[i2] + [i2]  < [i2], () > ) 
 < [i1], (d[i2])() + [i2] > (cid:17)exp((x, s)) =
=(cid:16)t [i1(f (s))] t [i2(g(s))]  < [i1(f )], (d[i2(g)])() + [i2(g)] > (cid:17)

exp((x, s))

(13)

notice that there is an additional term in the right hand side , which is needed to
ensure unitarity.

5

in degree 3, the dierential polynomial is:

t [i1(f (s)) i2(g(s)) i3(h(s))]exp((x, s)) =

 (cid:16) (d[i1] + [i1]  < [i1], () > )
 < [i2], (d[i3])() + [i3] > (cid:17)
 < [i1], (d[i2]d[i3])() > !

exp((x, s)) =

(d[i2] + [i2]  < [i2], () > ) (d[i3] + [i3]  < [i3], () > )

 < [i1], (d[i3])() + [i3] > (d[i2] + [i2]  < [i2], () > )
 < [i1], (d[i2])() + [i2] > (d[i3] + [i3]  < [i3], () > )

(14)

t [i1(f (s))] t [i2(g(s)) i3(h(s))]

 < [i1(f )], (d[i3(h)])() + [i3(h)] > t [i2(g)]
 < [i1(f )], (d[i2(g)])() + [i2(g)] > t [i3(h)]

=(cid:16)
 < [i1(f )], (d[i2(g)]d[i3(h)])() > (cid:17)

exp((x, s))

higher degree polynomials are constructed in a similar fashion.

the rule.

we associate to each i[f (s)] in universal enveloping algebra a dierential operator

on representation space

d[i[f (s)]] + [i[f (s)]]  <[i[f (s)]], ..

where <[i[f (s)]], .. acts on the right, on terms in h in the symmetric tensor powers
symh., by forming scalar products with those terms in all possible ways.

t [
exp((x, s)) =

] exp((x, s)) = t [l(f (s)) iij(g)]  t [iij(g) l(f (s))]

 < [ij,0(f ), > t [ii,0(f g)] + < [ii,0(f ), > t [ij,0(f g)]+

= 2(cid:16) < [ij,0(f g), > t [ii,0(f )]  < [ii,0(f g), > t [ij,0(f )]

exp((x, s))

t [

[l(f (s)), l(g(s))]

2.4 virasoro algebra and sugawara construction.

sugawara construction works well for highest-weight current algebra modules. our
module, constructed above, is not the highest or lowest weight module, which makes
sugawara construction of virasoro algebra dicult. namely, sugawara construction
expresses generators of virasoro algebra in terms of an innite sum of elements in
universal enveloping algebra of current algebra; a standard formal manipulation with
such sum, using relations in universal enveloping algebra of currents, give commuta-
tion relations of virasoro algebra; and of course as we have same relations in universal
enveloping algebra, doing same formal manipulations with the same sugawara for-
mula we get virasoro. however, for this manipulation to be justied, it is extremely

7

helpful to understand those relations in a week sense, as elements in universal en-
veloping algebra acting on some highest weight module, since acting on such module,
the sum becomes nite, and all manipulations are justied. in our case, we consider
the action of elements in the universal enveloping algebra (we now have to switch to
a complex case from the real one)

1

qa t [xk xi<j
ii,0(eiks) ii,0(ei(k+m)s)]! ,

lm = 

xi

iij(eiks) iij(ei(k+m)s) 

where qa = 2(n + 1), with m 6= 0, acts on symbols exp without problems, since the
(d + )[iij(f (s))] (d + )[iij(g(s)) 

main dierential symbol of such operators, xi<j
xi

(d + )[ii,0(f (s))] (d + )[ii,0(g(s))] is zero, so only terms with scalar products

remain, and for those the summation is a fourier series- type summation, so it typ-
ically converges. (one can use or not use the normal ordering, since as we are in a
non highest weight module, it does not aect anything at all, as those elements which
we may or maynot order commute in the lie algebra, and the ordering doesnot aect
convergence here).

however, the commutation relations, in such a way of dealing with sums are not
those of virasoro algebra, since, when acting on highest weight modules, summation in
sugawara construction get restricted in a very peculiar way; in our case, summation is
unrestricted, which does not produce divergences, but spoils commutation relations.
there is another way to do summation, imitating what happens in highest weight
module, which formally produces commutation relations of virasoro, but in fact what
this formal computation does is subtracting two divergent expressions. so we have
a pretty much anomalous situation, where theres a conict between regularization
of formulas we are trying to write and the algebraic structure we are trying to get;
and although we understand how things breaks down, we found no satisfactory to
ourselves way to x it. performing a non-divergent computation of commutators in
our representation, the commutators with currents and among virasoro generators
are trying to be zero rather then the ones of virasoro algebra. ( computation is
similar to computation of commutators of operator l(f (s)) above). it is not quite
clear to us at the moment what it means. virasoro algebra in particular is useful to
move around on the world sheet, so what it seems to be saying is that once we got
to the boundary, it should be pretty hard to get away from it, as doing so exists only
in a formal setting, rather then in a convergent one; it is also related to the fact that
our unitary representation has way too many states (compared to a verma module,
say), as it is as big as a direct integral of representation of so(1, n) over a circle.

8

3 conclusions

we described a unitary, non-highest weight, irreducible representation of cso(1, n),

(without central extension), the action of its universal enveloping algebra on repre-
sentation space, and discussed the sugawara construction. we believe unitary, non
highest weight representations should play a role in describing boundary states in
ads-type constructions. however, not much is known about conformal eld theories
with non-highest weight states for currents; even getting virasoro algebra, via sug-
awara construction appears to be a formal, rather then a convergent procedure; a
convergent procedure seem to suggest that the energy momentum tensor act on such
representation as a constant commuting with currents.
