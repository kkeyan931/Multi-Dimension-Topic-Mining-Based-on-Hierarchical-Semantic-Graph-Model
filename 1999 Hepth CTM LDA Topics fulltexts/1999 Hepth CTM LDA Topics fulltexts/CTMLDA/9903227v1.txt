abstract

we describe a scheme for constructing the holographic dual of the full d3-brane geom-
etry with charge k by embedding it into a large anti-de sitter space of size n . such
a geometry is realized in a multi-center anti-de sitter geometry which admits a simple
eld theory interpretation as su (n + k) gauge theory broken to su (n )  su (k).
we nd that the characteristic size of the d3-brane geometry is of order (k/n )1/4u 0
where u 0 is the scale of the higgs. by choosing n to be much larger than k, the
scale of the d3-brane metric can be well separated from the higgs scale in the radial
coordinate. we generalize the holographic energy-distance relation and estimate the
characteristic energy scale associated with these radial scales, and nd that the e/u
relation becomes eectively u independent in the range (k/n )1/2u 0 < u < u 0. this
implies that all detailed structure of the d3-brane geometry is encoded in the ne
structure of the boundary gauge theory at around the higgs scale.

the conjecture of maldacena [1] relating type iib string theory on ads5  s5 to n = 4
sym on 3+1 dimensions was originally formulated by taking the near horizon or the
decoupling limit of d3-branes sitting in at space. even before the formulation of the
maldacena conjecture, the close connection between the gauge theory living on the world
volume of a d-brane and the supergravity background was explored in the context of com-
puting absorption cross-sections [2, 3, 4]. once the details of the correspondence between
the bulk and the boundary theories were better understood [5, 6], it became sensible to dis-
card the asymptotically at region of the d3-brane background and work entirely with the
near horizon anti-de sitter geometry. the reason is that the maldacena conjecture can be
stated concretely in a form of an identity of suitably dened generating functions between
string theory on anti-de sitter space and the gauge theory on its boundary. one speaks of
the boundary theory being holographically dual to the bulk theory [7, 8], and in the case
of ads5  s5 arising from the near horizon limit of the d3-brane, both the bulk1 and the
boundary theory are well dened.

just because we have come to understand the holographic dual of the near horizon
ads5  s5 geometry does not mean that the holographic dual of the full d3-brane geometry
does not exist. indeed, we expect all theory of gravity to have a holographic dual [7, 8]. it is
therefore quite natural to ask what the boundary dual to string theory in the full d3-brane
background might be. in this note we provide an answer to this question, although in an
implicit form.

it is easy to appreciate the scope of this problem: the holographic dual on the boundary
is likely to be a very complicated theory. the d3-brane background and the ads5  s5
background behave more or less the same way in the small radius region, but dier drastically
at large radius. in holography, small and large radius regions of the bulk theory are associated
with the infra-red and ultra-violet of the boundary theory, respectively [1, 9]. this means
that the uv structure of the boundary theory must be drastically dierent than that of the
sym theory. in [10], it was suggested that this theory might be realized as a condensate of the
irrelevant operator f 4. however, without the detailed knowledge of the uv structure of the
theory, it is not clear if a sensible meaning can be attached to condensation of an irrelevant
operator (see e.g. [6]). since the geometry of the d3-brane metric is asymptotically at,
it is quite likely that the boundary theory, whatever it may be, is as complicated as the
holographic dual of the full type iib string theory on minkowski space [11, 12, 13].

in this note, we resolve the ambiguity of the uv structure of the boundary theory by
embedding it in some other theory whose uv structure is better understood. the boundary

1this is true up to the subtle issue of dening string theories in a presence of rr background. currently,

only the supergravity approximation which can be trusted at low energies is properly formulated.

theory of interest to us can be extracted by owing along the renormalization group down
to the appropriate scale. although such a procedure will always lead to a uv complete
description of an eective eld theory, it is generally dicult to determine what uv xed
point can give rise to a renormalization group ow that reaches the eective theory of
interest. in a holographic theory, however, it is very straight forward to embed an arbitrary
ir structure of interest into a well dened uv structure. the idea is to simply embed the bulk
geometry of the ir theory somewhere in the near core region which smoothly interpolates
to the bulk geometry of the uv xed point. a very convenient bulk geometry to use as a
uv xed point is the anti-de sitter space, since we understand the uv structure from the
boundary point of view as well2. in order to formulate the holographic dual of the d3-brane
geometry, all that we have to do is to consider a bulk geometry which at small radius looks
more or less like a d3-brane geometry, but behaves at very large radius like an anti-de sitter
space.

it turns out that a supergravity solution which interpolates between a full d3-brane
metric (with the asymptotically at region) and an anti-de sitter space is very easy to
construct. one needs to look no further than the multi-centered anti-de sitter solution.
let us demonstrate this explicitly. consider a type iib supergravity solution for parallel
d3-branes with charges n  k  1.

essentially, the 4gn/(~u + ~u 0
)4 term in the harmonic function at the vicinity of u = 0
acts as the 1 to simulate the asymptotically at region. an important point that we
learn from this exercise is that the characteristic length scale (k/n)1/4|~u 0
| associated with
the d3-brane metric is clearly well separated from the higgs scale |~u 
0 | or the scale of the
cosmological curvature (4gn)1/4/1/2. therefore, there is plenty of room to t an entire
d3-brane metric with an asymptotically at region, especially if we take the large n limit
while focusing on scales of order (k/n)1/4|~u 0
|. this separation of scales was possible because
we chose to scale k and n dierently.

in a certain sense, the point being made here is rather trivial in light of the fact that one
takes a large n limit of the anti-de sitter space with rr charge n to recover the at space
[12, 13]. if we combine such a at space limit with a source for k units of rr ux, we were
bound to recover the full d3-brane metric.

the interpretation of multi-centered anti-de sitter solution as the sym with higgs vev
of order ~u 0
 have been discussed by many authors [1, 18, 19]. one surprising aspect of sym
with large t hooft coupling is the fact that energies associated with this vev is not |~u 0
|
|/gn [20]. in other words, gauge theory observable such as the two point function
but |~u 0
|/gn.
ho(x)o(0)i will only feel the eect of higgsing when 1/x becomes of order |~u 0
having identied (k/n)1/4|~u 0
| as an important scale in describing the d3-brane geometry,
we would like to know to what energy this scale corresponds from the point of view of the
boundary theory. we will address this issue in the remainder of this note.

in order to associate an energy scale to (k/n)1/4|~u 0

|, we need to generalize the notion

derived in [9, 20], to multi-center backgrounds. this formula was derived in [20] by computing
the skin depth of the boundary uctuation into the bulk, and by utilizing the holographic
information bound in [9]. it turns out, however, that this same formula can be derived in
many dierent ways.3 we will use the method most convenient for us, but let us list a few
example of an alternative method for deriving (6).

one such approach is to recall the calculation of wilson loop expectation value as minimal
surfaces [21, 22]. when a string is suspended from innity with its endpoint separated by
l = 1/e, it penetrates the radial direction down to some radius u. the relation between u
and l = 1/e is equivalent to (6)4. perhaps the methods developed in [23] can be adopted
for this purpose.

3we thank sunny itzhaki for many discussions on this point.
4see equation (5.2) of [22].

an alternative approach is to consider a light-cone originating from a xed point in the
boundary [24]. in a given time t, the signal on the boundary will spread in size by the rate
determined by the speed of light. the energy associated with this size is therefore e = 1/t.
in the same time interval, the light signal will travel in the radial direction by some amount
u(t). the relation between u and e determined this way also leads to (6).

for our application, this last approach is very convenient since all that is required is to

solve the null geodesic equation

(7)

where for convenience, we have oriented ~u to be parallel to ~u 0 and dropped the vector sign.
choosing dierent orientations will not drastically change the story as long as the signal do
not fall into the region near the n branes. note that if we set u 0 = 0 and k = 0, this
equation can be integrated trivially to give

4gn

u

t =

(8)

which is equivalent to (6). if u 0 and k are both non-vanishing, we will have to work a little
harder. to get a rough estimate of t(u), it is convenient to divide the parameter space for
u into regions: (a) u 0 < u, (b) (k/n)1/4u 0 < u < u 0, and (c) u < (k/n)1/4u 0. in region
(a), we might as well set u 0 = 0 and we get the essentially same result as (8)

t(u) = q4g(n + k)

in region (b), (7) can be approximated by

inverting (9), (11), and (13), we seem to be nding that in region (a),

in region (b) by the time u reaches (k/n)1/4u 0, e(u) is given by

which is of the same order of magnitude as e(u 0). in fact, e(u) will continue to be in the

same order of magnitude even in region (c) until u become smaller than qk/nu 0 at which

point the rst term in (13) starts to dominate, leading to

e(u) =

u

4gk

.

(16)

since we do not rely on this kind of analysis beyond estimating orders of magnitudes, the
picture that seems to be emerging is the following: the energy-distance relation for u > u 0

these regions, e(u) will remain more or less constant at the energy of order higgs scale

behaves like (14), while for u < qk/nu 0 it behaves like (16). for the values of u in between
e = u/gn. note that the scale of interest to us, namely u  (k/n)1/4u 0 is precisely in

this at region. see gure 1 for an illustration.

the multi-center solution breaks the s5 spherical symmetry, but this symmetry can be
restored by smearing the supergravity solution (2) along the s5. this leads to a geometry
of the form

ds2 = f (u)1/2d~x2

k + f (u)1/2d~u 2.

where

which is that of an ads5  s5 for u > u 0 and a full d3-brane geometry of size (k/n)1/4u 0
for u < u 0. if we set k = 0, this is precisely the at space region described in [25]. turning
on k then has a simple interpretation as placing a small d3-brane in this at space-time
patch. one can apply the method of [5, 6] for computing the correlation function of chiral
primary operators by solving the wave equation for modes propagating in this background.
at linear order in uctuations, the minimal scalar equation will be of the standard bessel
form for u 0 < u, whereas for u < u 0, it will be of the mathieu form [26]. the solution to
these equation are to be matched at u = u 0. the energy distance relation can be derived
using the null geodesic equation and, for non-zero k, leads to the same general structure as
what we found for the unsmeared solution5.

this conclusion seems rather robust and independent of the details of the derivation. if
we insist that (a) e(u) be given by (14) down to u = u 0, (b) that e(u) to be given by (16)
deep in the ir, and (c) that e(u) be a monotonic function, then e(u) must remain more

or less at in the region qk/nu 0 < u < u 0.

we seem to have no choice but to conclude that although u 0 and (k/n)1/4u 0 appear to
be well separated in the radial scale, from the point of view of the energy via the energy-
distance relation, the two scales are not separated at all. in fact, they are all at the higgs
scale. it seems quite remarkable that the detailed structure of full d3-brane metric is encoded
in the ne structure of the higgsed sym at around the higgs scale. with a suciently
powerful spectrum analyzer and with a lot of patience, all of the details of say the absorption
and hawking emission by the d3-brane including all mathieu [26] and quantum corrections is
in principle reconstructible from the gauge theory. from a practical point of view, however,
the fact that so much information is crammed in such a narrow scale in energy suggests that
it would be extremely dicult to isolate and extract information of interest from the full
theory.

5it is interesting to note that for k = 0, the energy converges to a nite quantity of order u 0/gn as
u  0. this suggests that the theory is empty at energies below this scale. in fact, the eld theory dual to
this simple background seems to exhibit mass-gap and connement.
