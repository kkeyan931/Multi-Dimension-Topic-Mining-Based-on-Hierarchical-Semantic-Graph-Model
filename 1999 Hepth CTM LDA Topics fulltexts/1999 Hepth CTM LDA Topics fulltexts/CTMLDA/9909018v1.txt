abstract

we formulate the eld equations for su() einstein-yang-mills theory, and nd spher-
ically symmetric black-hole solutions. this model may be motivated by string theory
considerations, given the enormous gauge symmetries which characterize string theory.
the solutions simplify considerably in the presence of a negative cosmological constant,
particularly for the limiting cases of a very large cosmological constant or very small
gauge eld. the situation of an arbitrarily small gauge eld is relevant for holography
and we comment on the ads/cft conjecture in this light. the black holes possess in-
nite amounts of gauge eld hair, and we speculate on possible consequences of this for
quantum decoherence, which, however, we do not tackle here.

1 introduction

the discovery of the bartnik-mckinnon self-gravitating particle-like structure [1] has
opened the way for the construction of several hairy black hole structures in einstein
theories coupled to non-abelian gauge elds [2]. in this work we would like to address
some issues concerning black hole solutions in su() gauge theories. our interest in
such structures will be motivated by string theory considerations. string theories are
known to be characterized by innite-dimensional gauge symmetries, relating the various
string levels. such innite symmetries have been argued [3, 4] to be sucient for the
maintainance of quantum coherence during black hole (quantum) evaporation. the basic
idea behind such conjectures is that innite symmetries are sucient to encode all the
information inside a stringy black hole, since the latter can be in any one of an innity
of excited massive-string level states during the evaporation, thereby accounting for the
enormous number of states that appears to characterize the bekenstein-hawking entropy
formula for macroscopic black holes. this obviously could not have been achieved in a
local eld theory with a nite number of conserved charges.

however, the point of view of ref. [4] was that simply innite-dimensional symmetries
were not by themselves sucient to maintain coherence, during the complex process of
evaporation/decay in string theory. studies in prototypes of two-target-space-dimensional
string theories have revealed that the latter possess black hole structures which are char-
acterized [4, 5] by specic innite-dimensional symmetries, namely w symmetries [5],
in their target space. such symmetries have the peculiar property of preserving a two-
dimensional phase-space manifold under target-time translations, which in the particular
case of two-dimensional strings may be identied with the phase space of scalar massless
matter in the two-dimensional black hole space time. hence, during black-hole quantum
evaporation, which according to ref.
[4], is a non-thermal phenomenon associated with
the decay of excited black hole (internal) string states, quantum coherence of the string
matter is maintained as a result of geometrical properties of the black hole hair itself
(w -hair).

although this phenomenon seems to be a novel way of tackling the coherence issue,
however, the fact that in ref.
[4] has been explicitly demonstrated in two-dimensional
black holes has the drawback that it might be connected strictly to the two-dimensional
space time. such objections can be answered, of course, by making an analogy of the two-
dimensional stringy black hole with an eective theory arising in realistic four-dimensional
theories of quantum gravity upon restricting oneself to spherically-symmetric space-time
congurations; but then the challenge remains to construct explicitly string theories in
four dimensions with this property.

1

motivated by these considerations, we would like in this note to take a dierent view-
point, and consider black holes in standard einstein four-dimensional space-times, which
however capture some of the essential features of the above-mentioned two-dimensional
stringy black holes, namely the innite-dimensional character of the gauge hair, as well
as its area-preserving nature, which was argued to be responsible for two-dimensional
quantum coherence [4]. at this point we should stress that the w -hair of ref.
[4] was
quantum hair [6], arguably measured by aharonov-bohm type experiments, and there-
fore pertaining to phases in the respective matter wave functions, whereas in this paper
we are concerned with purely classical hair. nevertheless, some of the features we nd,
specically the holographic properties, may be related to the issue of quantum coherence
in the sense of ref. [4].

gauge theories with gauge group su(n), n  , remarkably share these features,
since gauge transformations in the large-n limit yield an ancestor of the w algebra,
according to the analysis of ref.
[7]. indeed, in this limit the non-abelian commutators
of such gauge transformations become classical-like poisson brackets, which have the
property of preserving the area of an internal sphere, s2, pertaining to the gauge group
variables. for details on this construction we refer the reader to the literature [7]; here
we shall make use only of the results relevant for our purposes, namely the technicalities
involved in taking the limit n  . black hole solutions of the einstein-yang-mills
(eym) equations for nite n have been discussed in [8]. however, as was pointed out
there, the nite-n analysis could not be extended smoothly to the case n  . it is
the purpose of this article to establish the existence of su() classical gauge hair in the
eym black-hole system.

the area-preserving nature of the innite-n gauge hair is an encouraging sign for the
maintainance of quantum coherence during the evaporation process; however, to prove this
conjecture one should study the precise mechanism behind the evaporation, which in view
of the absence of a satisfactory four-dimensional quantum theory of gravity, is not feasible
at present. nevertheless, as we shall show in this article, the analytic formulation of black
hole solutions with innite gauge hair simplies greatly in the presence of a negative
cosmological constant (no matter how small). we have arbitrarily small gauge eld hair
(which is not possible in the absence of a cosmological constant). this implies that anti-de
sitter geometries may be used as regulators for the su() eym black holes with zero
cosmological constant, and therefore one can appeal to the concept of holography in the
sense of [9]. this means that the behaviour of the gauge eld in the bulk (i.e. outside the
event horizon) is determined by the structure at innity (boundary). anti-de sitter space-
times have recently attracted great attention in view of their relevance to the conjectured
equivalence between some conformal eld theories on their boundary with the classical

2

bulk structure (ads/cft correspondence) [10, 11]. the above-mentioned holographic
point of view, together with the specic area-preserving properties of the su() gauge
group, makes this model an interesting classical hair analogue of the w -hair picture of
[4]. whether it survives at the full quantum level remains an open question.

the structure of the present paper is as follows. in section 2, we review briey the math-
ematical formalism behind einstein-yang-mills systems, by concentrating on the construc-
tion of the eld equations for spherically symmetric black hole solutions for su() gauge
group. we take carefully the limit n  , by following the same procedure as ref.
[7], which led to the area-preserving property of the su() gauge transformations. we
include a cosmological constant  in our model.
in section 3 we consider the limit in
which the cosmological constant is large and negative, since in this limit it is known that
the su(2) system simplies signicantly [12]. we perform an asymptotic expansion in
 = 1/ and obtain analytic solutions to rst order in , which reveal many of the prop-
erties we expect the black holes to possess in general. we also consider the solutions for
a very small gauge eld, when the eld equations again simplify considerably. as already
mentioned, this situation is of particular interest for our ideas concerning holography [9]
and the ads/cft correspondence [10, 11].

2 ansatz and eld equations for su () gauge field

2.1 mathematical construction of the gauge field

it is the purpose of this section to study in detail the mathematical construction of an
su(n) gauge eld, extending in a non-trivial way the at-space-time approach of ref. [7].
first we shall keep n nite, and at the end we shall take the limit n   in a similar
way as the one considered in [7]. the mathematical issue of how su() is constructed is
rather subtle, but we shall not focus on these diculties. instead, we shall assume that the
construction in [7] is well-dened and take that as our denition of su(). we restrict our
attention to space-times which are static and spherically symmetric, and shall therefore
use the analysis of the spherically symmetric su(n) gauge eld [13]. throughout this
paper, the metric has signature (, +, +, +). we shall retain the gravitational coupling
constant  but set c = 1.

where d(n ) = diag{k1, . . . , kn}, with k1  k2  . . .  kn integers whose sum is zero. the
n  n matrix c is strictly upper triangular, with complex entries satisfying c (n )
6= 0
only if ki = kj + 2; and c  is its hermitian conjugate. the anti-hermitian matrices a, b
commute with d. in addition, d must satisfy the commutation relations:

[(c (n ) + c (n )) sin  + d(n ) cos ]d (4)

a suitable irreducible ansatz is to take [13]:

[d, c] = 2c,

[d, c ] = 2c .

d(n ) = diag{n  1, n  3, . . .  n + 3,n + 1}.

2.2 field equations for einstein-su() yang-mills theory

the einstein and yang-mills equations for an su(n) gauge theory, in a spherically-
symmetric space-time, have been derived in ref.
[13]. it is the point of this subsection
to re-derive these equations in the limit n  . to this end we rst start by briey
reviewing the results of ref. [13], that are relevant for our purposes here. for more details
on the nite-n su(n) gauge theory we refer the interested reader to ref. [13].

firstly, we consider the yang-mills equations. one component of these leads to the

following equation, for the ansatz (8), where none of the (n )

vanish,

j

b(n )
j + 

(n )
j = 0.

(23)

j = 0 for static solutions [15], and then on account of (23) one has 

so far we have not xed our choice of gauge, so we use the remaining gauge freedom we
(n )
have to set b(n )
j = 0.
this implies that each (n )
is a constant, which we set equal to 0 for simplicity. in addition,
we shall concentrate on purely magnetic eld congurations by setting a(n )
j = 0 for all j.

in order to obtain a nite limit of the eld equations as n  , care is needed with
factors of n. the ansatz used in the equations below is (21), with the basis of su(n)
matrices constructed from the rescaled matrices i (20). the eld equations can then be
taken from [13], making the following substitution [7]

we consider a spherically symmetric geometry described by the following metric,
schwarzschild co-ordinates:

in

a  n a.

(24)

ds2 = e2(r) dt2 + 1dr2 + r2(cid:16)d2 + sin2  d2(cid:17) ,

where the metric function  has the form

 = 1 

2m(r)

r 

r2
3

,

(25)

(26)

and we have introduced a cosmological constant .
it should be emphasised at this
point that the co-ordinates ,  are dierent from the internal variables , , which
appeared in the ansatz for the su() gauge elds in the previous section. for nite n,
the remaining yang-mills equation is, with  denoting derivative with respect to r,

r2c  + 2m 

2r3

3  r3p! c  + c +

1
2

n 2[c, [c, c ]] = 0

(27)

where  is the gravitational coupling constant (we have set the gauge eld coupling con-
stant to unity), and

(28)

(29)

(30)

the einstein equations read

p =

1
r4 tr (d  n[c, c ])2.

where

m =



2 (cid:16)g + r2p(cid:17) ,

 =


r

g

g = tr (c c

).

the presence of the explicit factors of n is due to the substitution (24) and will be
essential for obtaining the limit n  .

in taking the limit n  , the matrix c becomes a function of the internal co-
ordinates ,  (i.e. those variables which are the arguments of the spherical harmonics,

8

rather than the space-time co-ordinates  and ). the following substitutions are made
[7]:

tr 

1

4 z 

=0z 2

=0

sin  d d

n[p, q]  i{p (r, , ), q(r, , )} ,

where the poisson bracket is dened as:

{p, q} =

p

(cos )

q
 

p


q

.

the yang-mills equation (27) therefore takes the form

r2

2c

r2 + 2m 

2r3

3  r3p! c

r

2{c,{c, c }} = 0

(34)

the ansatz of the previous section (22) can be written as:

c(r, , ) = f (r, )ei,

d = d1 cos ,

(35)

where f is a real function and d1 a real constant. the generalization of the kunzle [13]
ansatz for su(n) (6) would imply that d1 = 2. however, in order for d to satisfy the
su() equivalent of the conditions (5), namely,

i{d, c} = 2c,

i{d, c } = 2c 

(36)

it must be the case that d1 = 2. we shall take this value of d1 when we consider solutions
of the eld equations in the next section.

in terms of the co-ordinate  = cos , the yang-mills equation can be written as:

r2

2f

r2 + 2m

(f 2)!2

(38)

this is the simplest form of the equations for our purposes. the function f is further
restricted by the ansatz (22) to be of the form

f (r, ) = q1  2



xi=1

fi(r)i.

(39)

in the next section we shall consider black hole solutions of the equations (29,37,38).

3 black hole solutions of the su () eld equations

we now turn to the solutions of the eld equations (29,37,38), focusing our attention
on black hole geometries. these equations are rather complicated, since they involve a
non-linear partial dierential equation and integro-dierential equations. given the fact
that the su(n) equations have only been solved numerically, tackling the eld equations
we have here would require a considerable amount of complex numerical calculations. the
approach we shall take here is rstly to consider the special cases, namely the embedded
schwarzschild, reissner-nordstrom and su(2) black holes, in order to check our formalism
and x the remaining constants. then we shall employ an asymptotic expansion in
 = 1/ for the case  < 0, ||  . this technique will enable us to nd analytic,
perturbative solutions which, it is hoped, will have many of the physical properties of the
more general exact solutions but will be more amenable to analysis. we are looking for
black hole solutions with a regular event horizon at r = rh, and we want the geometry
to approach (the covering space of) anti-de sitter space (ads) as r  . in the nal
subsection we shall make the alternative approximation of a very small gauge eld (|f| 
1), in which case the eld equations again simplify considerably, for all negative values
of . this situation is particularly relevant in view of holography and the ads/cft
correspondence [10, 11].

3.1 embedded su (2) solutions

before discussing the genuine su() solutions of the eld equations (29,37,38), we
rst consider embedded su(2) solutions. for all n, it is known that su(n) eym theory

10

has neutral embedded su(2) solutions as well as charged embedded su(k) solutions for
k = 1, . . . , n  1 [8]. the neutral su(2) solutions can be readily embedded into su()
eym. however, this is not possible for the charged solutions, whatever the value of k,
including k = 2.

the yang-mills function f (r, ) is taken to be

then the yang-mills equation (37) reduces to:

f (r, ) = w(r)q1  2.

r2w + 2m 

2r3

3  r3p! w + w(1  w2) = 0,

and the quantities in the einstein equations are:

g =

2
3

w

2,

p =

1
3r4 (1  w2)2,

(40)

(41)

(42)

where we have xed d = 2 as discussed in the previous subsection. these equations are
exactly the same as those for su(2) eym if we set  = 3. this value of  is surprising,
since it is conventional in studies of su(n) eym (see, for example [8]) to take  = 2.
the factor of 3 arises from integrating the 1  2 term, which does not arise in su(2)

eym. in the following we shall take  = 3 in order that we can check our results by
comparison with the su(2) case.

there are two further special cases of the su(2) embedded solutions which should be
mentioned. firstly, setting   1 gives the schwarzschild-ads geometry, whilst setting
  0 gives a non-extremal reissner-nordstrom-ads black hole with charge q = 1.

3.2 solutions for ||  1
we now consider genuine su() solutions of the eld equations (29,37,38). in order
to generate analytic solutions, we shall consider the case where  < 0, ||  1. for
su(2) eym theory, the solutions are particularly simple in this limit, and have attractive
properties [12]. in particular, there are solutions which are linearly stable. this limit cor-
responds to large black holes, which possess a stable hartle-hawking state [16]. therefore,
these are the objects we are particularly interested in if one wishes to consider issues of
information loss during the evaporation process. also, in this limit stringy corrections in
the bulk geometry of ads are negligible [10, 11], and the eld theory limit is sucient.

where we have set the gravitational coupling constant  = 3 in order to obtain the
correct equations for the su(2) embedding, as discussed in the previous subsection. we
shall consider solutions for ||  1, and perform an asymptotic expansion for small  as
follows:

r3

q(r) = 
(r) = 1 + 1(r) + 22(r) + . . .

+ q1(r) + 2q2(r) + . . .

f (r, ) = f0() + f1(r, ) + 2f2(r, ). + . . .

(45)

when  = 0, the solution is a schwarzschild-ads black hole with horizon radius rh, and
the gauge eld f is an arbitrary function of  of the form (39). here we are using an
asymptotic expansion, in other words the rst few terms of the expansion above should
be an increasingly good approximation to the exact solutions as   0, and the number
of terms of the expansion which are useful will also increase as  decreases. this approxi-
mation will be reliable as long as the terms in the expansions remain uniformly bounded
in r. this is a strong assumption, but one which is valid for the terms in the expansion
we obtain here. the advantage of the expansion is that each term in the metric functions
q and  depends only on the previous terms in the expansion of the gauge function f , and
for each term in f , we have a dierential equation involving only derivatives with respect
to r for that term. therefore it is comparatively straightforward to nd solutions in the
form (45) to whatever order in  we like. we shall nd that interesting eects occur if we
work to second order in the metric functions and rst order in the gauge eld function.

to rst order in , we have:


1(r) = 0

where k1 is an arbitrary constant and we have xed the constant arising in 1 to be zero
so that the geometry has the correct asymptotic form at innity. the constant k1 will
be xed by the requirement that there is a regular event horizon at r = rh. this means
that q1 = rh
2 , qi = 0 for i  2 at rh. the form (48) corresponds to a reissner-nordstrom-
ads geometry, as would have been expected. we will therefore need to go to the next
order in the metric functions to get solutions with hair. integrating the equation for the
yang-mills eld in (46) gives

where c is an arbitrary function. we require f1 and all its derivatives to be regular

crh = f1.

f1(r, ) = f2() +

(51)

with another arbitrary function f2(). note that from (47), f1 is of the form (39), so if
we choose f2 to also be written as (39), then the whole gauge eld will have the structure
required. the function f1 above consists of genuine su() gauge eld hair. it contains
two arbitrary functions of  (subject to the restrictions just discussed), which require an
innite number of constants in order to specify them (which correspond to the coecients
in the expansion (39)).

whilst the constant k3 will be xed by the requirement that q2 = 0 at r = rh so that
we have a regular event horizon. we now have a hairy black hole metric, caused by the
coupling of the geometry to the su() yang-mills eld.
in gure 1 we compare the
approximate solution (51), with the exact numerical solution in the su(2) case, where
f has the form (40). we use parameters  = 100 and w(rh) = 0.8.
it can be seen
that the approximate solution converges a little too quickly, but otherwise has the same
qualitative features as the exact solution in this case. the approximation would become
better if we used more terms in the expansion (45), or if || was larger.

at this stage, a comment is in order concerning the nature of the hair we have found.
in particular, we wish to stress that the hair is denitely innite in quantity, and that

14

an innite number of parameters is required in order to describe it. as mentioned above,
the gauge eld requires an innite number of constants for it to be specied in this
approximation, since two arbitrary functions of  are involved. each subsequent term
in the expansion in  will introduce a further function of  into the gauge eld, and
hence a further innite number of quantities. suppose, however, that we wish to x the
behaviour of the gauge eld at, say, the event horizon (this was the procedure used to
x the constants in order to obtain gure 1, and is more convenient computationally
than xing quantities at innity). this would require an innite number of quantities
to specify, say f0(). the subsequent functions of  would be xed by requiring that
fi(r, ) = 0 at r = rh for i > 0, for example this would mean that

23f1()

h

.

f2() =

(56)

the result, either way, is that an innite number of parameters are needed to specify the
gauge eld function. next we turn to the metric functions. these do not depend on ,
but do contain constants constructed from the gauge eld function by integrating over .
each term in the perturbation expansion of the metric functions involves at least one new
constant constructed from the gauge eld function (which cannot be determined from
previous constants) as well as a constant of integration. the constants of integration can
easily be xed by the boundary conditions on the metric i.e. by setting i  0 as r  
for i > 0 so that the geometry has the correct behaviour at innity, and setting qi = 0 at
r = rh for i  2 so that there is a regular event horizon at r = rh. however, an innite
number of dierent constants, coming from the gauge eld function, will be required if
we are to specify the metric to all orders in . thus, while it appears that we only need a
nite number of constants to construct the metric to each order in perturbation theory,
the exact metric will need an innite number of constants, so that we do have innite
amounts of hair.

3.3 solutions with a small gauge eld

in the previous subsection, we performed an asymptotic expansion for very large ||,
and found analytic solutions representing black holes dressed with innite amounts of
gauge eld hair. we now turn to another situation in which we can nd solutions easily,
and which is of direct relevance to holography and the ads/cft correspondence [10,
11] (which partly motivates our consideration of black holes in ads). the holographic
principle (namely that dynamics of gauge elds in the bulk of ads is determined by what
is happening on the boundary) relies on a theorem of graham and lee [17] which applies
only to gauge elds suciently close to zero [11]. we stated previously that if the gauge
eld f  0, then the geometry is that of non-extremal reissner-nordstrom-anti-de sitter

15

(rn ads) space, with charge q = 1. therefore in this section we are in eect considering
perturbations about this conguration.

let  be a small parameter such that   1 and |f (r, )|   for all r, so that the
magnitude of the gauge eld is uniformly bounded and is close to zero. the parameter 
determines the magnitude of the gauge eld (no matter what the size of the cosmological
constant ) and should not be confused with  = 1/ of the previous section where
||  1. this condition of uniform boundedness is rather strong, as we shall see shortly,
and the negative cosmological constant is crucial if this condition is to be met. we then
consider the following asymptotic expansions of the eld variables as   0:

f (r, ) = hf0(r, ) + f1(r, ) + 2f2(r, ) + . . .i

m(r) = m0(r) + m1(r) + 2m2(r) + . . .
(r) = 1(r) + 22(r) + . . . .

(57)

these expansions are inserted into the eld equations (29,37,38), as a consequence of
which f1, m1 and 1 all vanish identically. in addition, we have, to lowest order, the rn
ads geometry, so that

m0(r) =

1
2rh

+

rh
2 

r3
h
6 

1
2r

.

(58)

in fact this is a good approximation to the exact metric function m, as can be seen from
gure 2, where we compare (58) with the exact numerical solution for the su(2) case with
 = 0.001 and w(rh) = 0.1. again, the approximate solution has the correct qualitative
features and just converges a little too quickly.

the yang-mills equation, to lowest order, tells us that the  dependence of f0 is arbitrary
(subject to (39)), but its r dependence is governed by the following dierential equation:

r2 1 

2m0
r 

r2

3 ! 2f0

r2 + 2m0 

2r3
3 

1

r! f0

r

+ f0 = 0.

(59)

this is exactly the same equation satised by very small su(2) gauge elds, and in this
case we can see that the gauge eld eectively becomes an innite number of su(2)
degrees of freedom. the interaction between the degrees of freedom does not come into
play in this approximation because the gauge eld is very small (and so we have ignored
terms involving f 2).

we can now use our knowledge of su(2) eym theory in ads [12] to comment on what
will happen in the su() case. from [12], there are solutions of su(2) eym theory in

16

which the gauge eld is uniformly bounded and arbitrarily small. this is very dierent
to the situation when  = 0, when w  1 as r  , so that any gauge eld which is
very small close to the event horizon, must become order unity at innity. in this case
our expansion in terms of  is not uniformly valid. for  > 0, it is possible to have gauge
elds which are uniformly arbitrarily small, however, in that case, the set of parameters
w(rh) which lead to regular black hole solutions consists of discrete points [18]. when the
cosmological constant is negative, we have regular black hole solutions for a continuous
interval of values of w(rh) containing zero, although the size of this interval shrinks to zero
as   0 [12]. therefore, for any negative cosmological constant (no matter how small
or large), we can specify any suciently small function f () satisfying the ansatz (39) to
be the gauge eld function at the event horizon, and then we have innite gauge eld
hair which remains arbitrarily small at all distances away from the black hole horizon,
including up to the boundary of ads. it is for this reason that we view the   0
model as a regulator model for su()-hair on asymptotically at space-times with
zero-cosmological constant. a zero-cosmological-constant situation might be desirable
from both theoretical and phenomenological points of view, e.g.
it may be the result
of a space-time symmetry like supersymmetry. notably, in the two-dimensional stringy
analogue of the w -hair [4], the ground-state energy of the two-dimensional string has
been preserved under the action of the w symmetries [19] and this could be viewed as
the analogue of a zero-cosmological constant situation.

4 conclusions

in this work we have formulated the eld equations for spherically-symmetric eym
black holes in su() gauge theory. their study was motivated by some considerations
in string theory, the holographic principle and the so-called ads/cft correspondence. we
have solved these equations both numerically and analytically in some cases. the intro-
duction of a negative cosmological constant (no matter how small) proved extremely useful
in simplifying the equations by means of appropriate perturbative expansions. speci-
cally, we have obtained solutions for the cases: (i)  < 0 with ||  1, and nite gauge
elds, and (ii)  < 0 arbitrary, and innitesimally small gauge elds. the latter case ex-
hibits holographic properties of the gauge-eld hair and may be relevant for issues related
to information loss.

however, as stressed in the introduction, the issue of quantum coherence is still far from
being understood. the above holographic properties pertain to classical eld congura-
tions, and it is not clear that they survive a full quantum treatment, where space-time
uctuations are taken into account. in ref. [20] we have presented an approach to quan-

17

tify entropy production during an evaporation process for the case of an su(2) eym
black hole, coupled to scalar matter [21]. this can be done by identifying the target-
space temporal evolution parameter, time t, with the logarithm of the brick-wall scale,
interpreted as a renormalization-group scale that regularizes ultraviolet (short-distance)
innities in the coupled matter/black hole system. one then concentrates on the logarith-
mic divergences in the expression for the entropy of the scalar eld. such divergences are
extra divergences that cannot be absorbed in a standard renormalization of newtons or
other eld-theory coupling constants (which for instance yield a regularized bekenstein-
hawking area law [21]). in that sense, such terms have been interpreted in [20] as entropy
production.

if the holographic properties of the su(n  ) eym ads background were to be
extended to the quantum case, such logarithmic divergences should have been suppressed
by inverse powers of n  . however, it can be easily seen that this is not the case for a
minimally-coupled scalar eld neutral under the gauge symmetry. indeed, the geometries
we consider are small perturbations near rn ads black-hole space times, and therefore
the entropy of a scalar eld interacting with this geometry is very nearly the same as
the rn ads case, which is known to be non-trivial [22]. however, the case of a scalar
eld coupled to the gauge degrees of freedom, which exhibit the holographic properties,
may completely change the picture. we hope to return to this issue in a future work.
nevertheless, we believe that the results presented in this work are of sucient interest
to motivate further studies in the above direction.
