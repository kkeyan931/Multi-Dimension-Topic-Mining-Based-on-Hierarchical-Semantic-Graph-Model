abstract

we derive the invariant operators of the zero-form, the one-form, the two-form
and the spinor from which the mass spectrum of kaluza klein of eleven-dimensional
supergravity on ads4  n 010 can be derived by means of harmonic analysis. we
calculate their eigenvalues for all representations of su (3)  so(3). we show that
the information contained in these operators is sucient to reconstruct the com-
plete n = 3 supersymmetry content of the compactied theory. we nd the n = 3
massless graviton multiplet, the betti multiplet and the su (3) killing vector mul-
tiplet.

1 introduction

in order to challenge maldacenas conjecture [1] in all kinds of circumstances there is
a strong need for solved gauge theories on ads manifolds. indeed, they provide one of
the two comparison terms in the anti-de sitter/conformal eld theory correspondence
[2]. a good deal of information to be checked lies already in the mass spectrum and the
supersymmetry multiplet structure of such theories.

a class of eleven-dimensional supergravity [3] solutions which may serve as compact-
ied supersymmetric vacuum backgrounds is given by the freund-rubin solutions [4].
they have the form ads4  m, where m is a compact seven-dimensional einstein mani-
fold. a particular convenient number of manifolds to use for such kaluza klein compact-
ications are the g/h coset spaces. part of their attraction comes from the fact that it
is immediate to read o their isometry groups. consequently one knows the gauge sym-
metries of the fundamental particle interactions. moreover, it is clear how to calculate
the mass spectrum of the four-dimensional theory. one can use harmonic analysis. as
was shown in [5, 6] and in a series of papers [7], this can be done by exhibiting the group
structure of the constituents of the coset rather than laboriously solving the dierential
equations. hence the calculation of the mass spectrum gets reduced to a group-theoretical
investigation of the coset and the nal masses are found upon calculating the eigenvalues
of some discrete operators. this is food for computers.
in this paper we outline the
necessary steps to be performed to reach this goal. even in the compactications where
the calculations become too gigantic the masses can still successfully be calculated in this
way.

the complete list of the seven-dimensional coset spaces that may serve to compactify
eleven-dimensional supergravity to four dimensions is known [8]. also the number of
the remaining supersymmetries and their geometries have been intensively studied in
the past. it turns out to contain some non-extremal supersymmetric cases that present
themselves as promising candidates for the anti-de sitter/conformal eld theory check.
this as opposed to kaluza klein on the seven-sphere which is related to the extremal
n = 8 supergravity theory [9]. there the spectrum can be derived from the short unitary
irreducible representation of osp(8|4) with highest spin two, see [10]. from the perspective
of the three-dimensional superconformal theory this means that all the composite primary
operators have conformal weight equal to their naive dimensions. hence no anomalous
dimensions are generated. one of such non-trivial compactications is the one on ads 
m 111, where m 111 is one of wittens m pqr spaces [11, 7]. for this manifold the complete
spectrum has been calculated and arranged in n = 2 multiplets, see [12] and [13]. this
spectrum provides some ideal material for the anti-de sitter/conformal eld theory check
which has already successfully been done [14].

in many cases of g/h compactications the isometry group can be read o directly,
being the group g. if that is true, then the superisometry group is simply the supergroup
osp(4|n )  g, where g = g  so(n ) and n is determined by the number of killing
spinors that are allowed on the manifold. yet this becomes slightly more complicated
when the normalizer n of h is non zero. then the isometry group becomes g  n
in stead of g. this is for instance the case for eleven-dimensional supergravity on a
background of

ads4  n 010 ,

(1)

with

n 010 

su(3)
u(1)

.

(2)

which was introduced in the paper [15]. it has been proven to yield a n = 3 background1
where the so(3) r-symmetry group is the normalizer of the u(1) in the denominator.
here the identication of the resulting so(3) multiplet spectrum is not a straightforward
exercise, as can be seen in [16] if one takes the description (2) for the manifold. still as l.
castellani and l. j. romans showed in [15], one can elegantly circumvent this diculty
by taking a description which has the normalizer taken into account from the very start.
in particular, as they suggested in [15, 16], one can exhibit the fact that the n = 3
supersymmetric n 010 is equal to

su(3)  su(2)
su(2)  u(1)

(3)

where the su(2) in the denominator is diagonally embedded in su(3)  su(2). in this
way the so(3)  su(2) is everywhere explicitly present.
the harmonic analysis on n 010 has been done partly by castellani in [16], using the
formulation (2). yet due to lack of computing power his calculation did not cover the com-
plete spectrum. it is the scope of this paper to extend the technique of harmonic analysis
to the alternative formulation (3) and derive really the complete spectrum. this choice is
motivated by the fact that the eld components will then automatically be organized in
irreducible representations of so(3). this will make the matching of the spectrum with
n = 3 multiplets possible. we present here a sucient part of the mass operator eigenval-
ues that contains enough information to reconstruct the complete spectrum by using the
supersymmetry mass relations [7]. this will be used in a subsequent paper [17] to derive
the complete multiplet structure of the n = 3 n 010 freund-rubin compactications.
the importance of the spectrum of eleven-dimensional supergravity on (1) lies in the
fact that an anti-de sitter/conformal eld theory comparison in this background is fairly
facilitated by the fact that for the four-dimensional theory the structure of the eective
lagrangian is already known to be [18],

su(3, 8)

su(3)  su(8)  u(1)

.

(4)

still, as becomes clear from the work presented in this paper, the mass spectrum of the
n = 3 theory is going to be enough non trivial to provide another powerful check of the
anti-de sitter/conformal eld theory duality.
the spectrum that we obtain here has to be organized in n = 3 multiplets. a system-
atic classication of all the possible short n = 3 multiplets and their superspace structure
does not exist in the literature. only the short vector multiplet in table 1 has been found
explicitly in [19]. as in the case of the ads  m 111 kaluza klein compactication the
matching of the mass spectrum will teach us a lot if not everything about the existence
of other short multiplets. following the arguments of [14] it turns out to be necessary to

1actually there are many dierent manifolds of this form due to the present freedom in the choice
of the vielbeins on this manifolds. however, as shown in [15, 16] there is a particular choice for which
n = 3.

table 1: the states of the osp(3|4) vector multiplet representation organized in represen-
tations of so(2)  su(2)spin and so(3)isospin as they appear in kaluza klein of eleven-
dimensional supergravity. the unitary bound for the ground state is satised e0 = j.
the names of the elds are chosen as in [7].

decompose the resulting n = 3 multiplets in n = 2 multiplets. upon doing so the states
of the resulting n = 3 multiplets can then be recognized as coming from the on-shell
eld components of the superelds on the n = 2 superspace that was introduced in [20].
their supereld constraints are then straightforwardly read o. we postpone this issue
to a future publication.

the work that we present here ts in a much wider project that is currently being
carried out by the torino group. the nal scope of this ads  n 010 spectrum is to check
the anti-de sitter/conformal eld theory correspondence as it has been carried out [14] for
ads  m 111. it will be done [21] also for eleven-dimensional supergravity on ads  qppp.
this paper is organized as follows. we start with a short description of the geometry of
n 010. we thereby restrict ourselves to the essentials that we will need further on. we leave
a more rigorous treatment to a future publication [22]. then we will repeat the standard
concepts of harmonic analysis and explain how they can be applied to eleven-dimensional
supergravity on ads4  n 010. using these techniques we will then compute the zero-form
operator m(0)3, the one-form operator m(0)2(1), the two-form operator m(0)(1)2 and the
spinor operator m(1/2)3 , the notation of these operators being the same as in [6, 7]. we
will then present their eigenvalues. we conclude by arguing that the information obtained
in this paper is sucient to calculate the complete spectrum. we will do so by means of
a concrete example: the massless graviton multiplet. moreover, in this way we will prove
that the remaining spectrum is indeed n = 3 supersymmetric. finally, we will identify
the series of irreducible representations of su(3)  su(2) with a common eld content.
for these series we will list the eigenvalues that are present. from these eigenvalues the
masses are then obtained by applying the mass formulas from [7].

2 the geometry of n 010

in this section we introduce the essential concepts2 of the geometry of n 010. we restrict
ourselves to the elements that serve our purposes. we leave a more elaborated treatment
to [22]. we x some freedom in the choice of the vielbeins. this will ensure that the
compactied theory on (1) will have n = 3 supersymmetry.

the n 010 coset spaces are special manifolds of the class of n pqr coset spaces,

g
h

=

su(3)  u(1)
u(1)  u(1)

(5)

where the integer numbers p, q, r specify the way in which the two u(1) generators m
and n of h are embedded in g,

2rp38 + i

with

r =q3p2 + q2 + 2r2 ,

q =q3p2 + q2 ,

(6)

(7)

where y is the u(1) generator in su(3)  u(1) and the su(3) generators  are given
in appendix b. we do not get into details in this paper but for a detailed description of
the denition, the geometry and the properties of these spaces we refer the reader to the
literature [15, 16, 22]. these spaces are seven dimensional and can be used to make a
freund-rubin background for eleven-dimensional supergravity,

ads  n 010 .

(8)

they are solutions of the eld equations of eleven-dimensional supergravity.

in this paper we restrict our attention to the case of n 010. it has been shown that

among these spaces there exists a class of cosets,

su(3)
u(1)

(9)

for p = 0, r = 0 which has su(3) holonomy and yields an n = 3 supergravity. in fact,
without loss of generality one can put q = 1 in this case. the normalizer of u(1) in su(3)
is u(1)  so(3). so the actual isometry is su(3)  so(3) and the resulting isometry
supergroup of the ads4  n 010 becomes osp(4|3)  su(3). so the extra so(3) in the
normalizer becomes the r symmetry of the supergroup.
in this paper we derive the mass spectrum of the kaluza klein theory on ads4  n 010
and to this end it is more convenient to use the alternative description which was proposed
by castellani and romans, where the so(3)  su(2) is already present form the start.
hence we use

2the material in this section was explained to me by leonardo castellani. i am indebted to him for

n 010 =

(10)

this. he also calculated the rescalings at an early stage of this research.

for the generators of su(3) we take i
2,  being the gell-mann
matrices (see appendix b) and  being the pauli matrices. the generator of u(1) is given
by

2  and for su(2) we take i

t8 = i

28 .

the su(2) is diagonally embedded in su(3)  su(2) with generators,

th = i

2 (a + a) ,

a = 1, 2, 3,

h = 9, 10, 11 .

(11)

(12)

where h = 9 corresponds to a = 1 and so on. we will call it su(2)diag. for the remaining
coset generators we have

t = i

2 (1  1, 2  2, 3  3, 4, 5, 6, 7)

we need the so(7) covariant derivative on the coset space. it is dened as

d = d + b (cid:16)t so(7)(cid:17)

(13)

(14)

where the one-form b is the connection of the coset space and t so(7) are the generators
of so(7), be it of the vector representation or the spinor representation,

where the matrices  of the so(7) cliord algebra are given in the appendix c and  is
the metric of appendix b.

as already explained, there is some freedom in the choice of the vielbeins, not all of

them leading to n = 3.

to see how this goes, let us recall that on the coset there is the invariant

l1d l = et + hth ,

(16)

where l is coset representative. h is the index running on h and  is the index running
on so(7), see appendix b for conventions. the elds e and h are the g/h vielbein
and the h connection. using the coset vielbein e we dene the coset connection b

,

de + b

  e = 0 .

(17)

the vielbein is specied up to 7 rescalings of the coset directions, see [6, 7, 16]. we take
this into account by introducing the seven parameters r

e  re .

5

(18)

then the form of the connection is obtained by solving the maurer-cartan equation, i.e.
applying the external derivative d to (16) and using d2 = 0,

(20)

now we specify the rescalings r. as is known [7], only for some well-chosen values
of these parameters does the manifold become an einstein manifold. moreover, as is
clear from [15, 16] not all of the valuable choices for these rescalings necessarily lead to
the contemplated number of supersymmetries. to see which of them do, we look at the
curvature. the curvature on the coset space is dened by

then we need the following rescalings3,

in order to have ricci curvature

ra = 2e ,
ra = 42 e

r = 12 e2  .

(21)

(24)

(25)

following the conventions of the papers [7] we put e = 1. then we will be able to apply
the mass relations and mass formulas that were obtained in these papers.

to conclude this section we give the explicit form of the embedding of the su(2)diag

in so(7) according to eq. (20). for the vector we get

that yield the einstein curvature (25). however not all of them necessarily lead to an n = 3 theory. as we
will show in the last section of this paper, the rescaling (24) that we adopt yields n = 3 supersymmetry.
we refer the reader for a detailed study of these rescalings to a future publication [22].

3 harmonic analysis

in this section we provide the main ingredients of harmonic analysis that we need for the
calculation of the masses of the zero-form, the one-form, the two-form and and the spinor.
the technique of harmonic analysis has been well established, see papers [6, 7, 16], so we
restrict ourselves to the essentials. we focus on its application to our coset n 010.

the main idea is that functions on a coset space g/h can be expanded in terms of
the components of the operators of the irreducible representations of g. in particular,
a complete set of functions ()
 (l(y)) on the coset g/h is given that transform in a
irreducible representation of h as follows,

()
 (l(y)h) = ()

 (l(y)) (d())

 ,

(30)

where () indicates the h-irreps and the  its indices. these functions depend on the
coordinates of the coset space via the coset representative l(y). then for such functions
the expansion is given by,

()

 (l(y)) =x()

c()
g (d())g (l(y)) ,

(31)

where g are the contracted indices of g and () label all the irreducible representations
of g that contain the irreducible representation () under reduction to h as follows4

()  . . . + () + . . . ,

h

(32)

the crucial step now is to use the fact that the covariant derivative (14) can be
expressed in terms of the coset generators plus some additional discrete operators. indeed,

4 in fact () may appear multiple times in the reduction, say m times.

in that case it should be

understood that the above sum contains () m times. for a more clear treatment of this see [6, 7]

8

there is no need to express this covariant derivative as a dierential operator. this is a
generic feature of coset manifolds [6, 7, 16]. it is extremely useful for our purposes since
evaluating the mass terms in the eld equation of eleven-dimensional supergravity can
then be done without solving dierential equations.

to see this, it is sucient to realize that the harmonic expansion ultimately is an
expansion in l(y)1. then one uses (16) to express the derivatives in terms of the vielbein.
then on a eld y on the coset space that sits in some representation of so(7) the covariant
derivative becomes

dy = rty +

rr
r

c

(t so(7))

y + 1

2 

rr
r

c

(t so(7))y

(33)

we now show how this reduction is done in the case where the coset is n 010.

in
particular we show how the representations of su(3)  su(2) reduce to representations
of su(2)diag  u(1). we also give the constraint that is to be imposed in order to ensure
the right u(1) weight of the harmonic.
let us look at the index structure of the objects (d())g(l(y)) in the expansion (31).

let us start with the indices g. clearly, they have the following structure,

g =

k1 . . . km2
n1 . . . nm2

being the product of a generic su(3) young tableau with a generic su(2) young tableau.
the indices run through

k1, . . . , km2, l1, . . . , lm1, n1, . . . , nm2 = 1, 2, 3
m1, . . . , m2j = 1, 2

(35)

let us now see whether the representation () contains a given representation () of
su(2)diag, to clarify (32). hence we look at the indices  in (d())g(l(y)).

by making use of the symmetries of the young tableaux one can, for xed values,

arrange the indices of () as follows,

g =

1 k1 . . . k2p
2 3 . . . 3
{z

we will use this notation henceforth. the indices k1, . . . , k2p, l1, . . . , l2q in the above young
tableau now get the values 1, 2 only. the parameters p and q get half-integer values. this
yields a

p  q  j

(39)

su(2)diag-representation in the reduction (32). from this representation one can extract
the irreducible representations by contracting pairs of the indices k, l, m with the -symbol.
note however that it is not necessary to contract pairs of a k with an l since then one
would be over counting, as can be seen upon using the cyclic identity,

(40)

thus in the young tableau (36) one takes only those su(2)diag-irrepses that are obtained
by contracting pairs of ks and ms and pairs of ls and ms. the remaining indices are
then completely symmetrized.

we specify the most generic class of young tableaux that we will need for the harmonic

analysis on n 010 and introduce the following notation for it, 5

(s,t,u)
k1...k2s,l1...l2t,m1...m2u (m1, m2, j; p) =

where we have indicated the number of boxes under the young tableaux. in the above
notation for the young tableaux (42) we do not a priori assume symmetrization of the
indices k1 . . . k2sl1 . . . l2t, although that is what we need in the harmonic expansion. it will
be useful for our purposes to consider the more general young tableaux of (42). it is also
clear that in this notation,

2s  2p  m2 ,

2t  2(j  u  p + s + t)  m1 ,

(43)
(44)

is assumed without notice. otherwise the young tableaux simply do not exist. the only
free su(2)diag-indices in the above young tableaux are the indices k1 . . . k2s, l1 . . . l2t and

5we use the notation,

ij  i1j1 . . . i2j j2j

(41)

10

m1 . . . m2u, since the indices i1 . . . i2(ju) are contracted with the indices j1 . . . j2(ju) by
means of the s. this is the most generic way nding the embedding of a

s  t  u

(45)
representation of su(2)diag in a su(3) su(2)-representation. we will refer to the three
spins as the s-spin, the t-spin and the u-spin.
it is now clear that all the irreducible
representations of su(2)diag under reduction of g to h, can be obtained be taking the
the s  t  u irreps from the decomposition of (45).
ator i

the young tableaux in expression (42) also transforms under u(1), i.e. for the gener-

28 it has weight,

i3(cid:16) 1

3 (m2  m1) + j  2p + (s + t  u)(cid:17) .

this weight has to be matched with the u(1) weight

3

i
2

(46)

(47)

(48)

that is known from the transformation of the harmonic as under (27) and (29). hence the
components of the su(2)diag-representation that appear in the reduction g  h will be
in a given u(1)-representation if p is constrained in terms of the g-representation labels
m1, m2, j and 

p = 1

2(cid:16)j + 1

3 (m2  m1) + (s + t  u)  1

2 (cid:17) .

when we will refer to the u(1) weight, we will refer to the number  henceforth. it is
important to realize here that this constraint not only constraints p in terms of m1, m2, j
but it also implies that the dierence m2  m1 has to be a multiple of three. moreover
as we will see later on j has to be a positive integer. the parameter p is half-integer.
now we know the embedding of the representations of su(2)diag  u(1) in su(3) 
in general all these young tableaux are not independent. this can easily be seen using

su(2) with a given su(2)diag-spin and u(1)-weight.

the cyclic identity,

(s,t,u)
k1...k2s,l1...l2t,m1...m2u (m1, m2, j; p) =

k1...k2s,l1...l2tm2u,m1...m2u1(cid:16)m1, m2, j; p + 1
2(cid:17)
(s,t+1/2,u1/2)
2(cid:17)(49)
k1...k2sm2u,l1...l2t,m1...m2u1(cid:16)m1, m2, j; p + 1
 (s+1/2,t,u1/2)

which is merely a generalization of the identity (40). this identity allows us to reduce
the number of young tableaux that we are using in most of the cases. for instance, if we
are considering su(3) irreducible representations that are big enough, i.e. the values m1
and m2 exceed the numbers,

m2  2p + 1,

(50)
then one might make the harmonic expansion in components of the form (s,t,u1/2) only.
an example where this is not possible is the 001 representation of su(2)diag embedded
in an su(3)  su(2) with

m1  2(j  u  p + s + t) + 1

m1 = m2 = 0 ,

j = 1 .

(51)

however, there is a subset of embeddings where one can restrict oneself to the following
components,

11

where u = 0 is understood in the notation of . in this paper, for the calculation of the
eigenvalues of the mass operators we will always assume that m1 and m2 are big enough
in order to justify an expansion in the components (52) only. in other words, here we
calculate the mass matrix for those su(3)  su(2) representations where the harmonics
sit in the s  t irreducible representation of the decomposition of the s-spin times the
t-spin. afterwards we will argue the eigenvalues thus obtained, seen as functions of the
labels m1, m2, j, are also the functions for the eigenvalues to be found in the cases where
this assumption fails. to illustrate this we will work out (51). yet a detailed study of
the existing eigenvalues of the mass operators in the cases of short multiplets will become
quite a subtle book-keeping exercise. fortunately it can be implemented in some computer
programs. all this will be explained in the last section of this paper.

we now apply this to kaluza klein on

ads4  n 010 .

(53)

we write the coordinates of ads4 as x and the coordinates of n 010 as y. a eld  on (53)
sits in a representation of so(1, 3) as well as in a representation of so(7), generically
being some multiple tensor product of the vector representation and the spinor repre-
sentation. as will be exemplied further on, these so(7) representations decompose in
representations () of h,

hence the elds decompose in su(2)diag fragments,

so(7)  (1)  . . .  (n) ,

(1)

...

(n)



 
 (x, y) =x()

then, using eq. (31) the fragments (n) can be expanded as
(x)()  (d())(y) ,

()

the dot indicates the contraction of the index g and

 =

(s,t)
(k1...ks,l1...lt) (m1, m2, j; p) ,

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

which is symmetrized in all indices k1 . . . ks, l1 . . . lt. the linearized eld equations on the
fragments of the 11-dimensional theory split as follows,

(2x + 2y) ()

 (x, y) = 0

(58)

12

then 2y(y ())(y) can be evaluated explicitly and provide the mass operators of the four-
dimensional theory. the evaluation of these mass matrices and their eigenvalues is the
subject of the following sections.

to see how the covariant derivative (33) works on the components of the young

tableaux (42), one rst straightforwardly derives the following formulae,

where m means that k is replaced by m and n means that l is replaced by n. the
hats on the indices k and l indicate that these indices are deleted. we have suppressed
the labels m1, m2, j, since they do not change under the transformations. in fact, they
do not change under the covariant derivative and the evaluation of the mass operators
can be done for xed m1, m2, j in the harmonic expansion (56). for the derivation of
the above expressions we used the cyclic identity (49). mind that in the young tableaux
(s,t)
k1...k2s,l1...l2t(p) we have not symmetrized the indices k1 . . . k2s, l1 . . . l2t. recall that in the
notation (52) there is no symmetrization in these indices.

looking at the expression for the covariant derivative in eq. (33), one sees that the
generators t are precisely given by the above formulae (59) and (60) multiplied with i
2.
moreover, these formulae can be programmed on a computer and in this way the covariant
derivative is easily calculated.

4 the 0-form, the 1-form, the 2-form and the spinor

in the previous section we explained how harmonic analysis is done on the coset n 010 =
su(3)  su(2)/su(2)  u(1) when the su(2) is diagonally embedded in su(3). in this
section we apply this to the elds of eleven-dimensional supergravity.

table 2: the content of harmonics of eleven-dimensional supergravity:
their name as in [7], their so(7) irreducible representations and their
eld equations.

the elds of eleven-dimensional supergravity are expanded around the freund-rubin
background. their uctuations are the metric hm n (x, y), the three-form am n p (x, y) and
the spinor m (x, y). they can be expanded in the following harmonics [6, 7]: the scalar
y (y), the transverse vector y (y), the transverse 2-form y (y), the transverse 3-form
y (y), the symmetric transverse traceless tensor y {}(y), the spinor (y) and the
irreducible vector spinor (y). we list them in table 2 together with their so(7) irre-
ducible representation and their invariant eld equations written in terms of the covariant
derivatives of the coset (33). the following elds are transverse,

dy = 0 ,
dy[] = 0 ,
dy[] = 0 ,
dy() = 0 ,
d = 0 .

(61)

since we are dealing with n = 3 supersymmetry it will suce to know the masses for
the zero-form, the one-form, the two-form and the spinor only. the rest of the multiplet

14

spectrum can then be determined using supersymmetry.

the decomposition of the so(7) vector representation into irreducible representations

of su(2)diag goes as follows

(0, 0, 0)  (1, 0) ,
(1, 0, 0)  (3, 0)  (2, 1)  (2,1) ,
(1, 1, 0)  (4, 1)  (4,1)  (3, 0)  (3, 0) 

(2,1)  (2, 1)  (1, 2)  (1,2)  (1, 0) ,

(62)

where the irreducible representations of su(2)diag u(1) are written as (2(s + t) + 1, ),
 being the u(1) weight (47). one may check now that from the formula (48) it follows
indeed that j has to be an integer number. accordingly, an so(7) one-form and an
so(7) two-form can be expressed in terms of the following su(2)diag fragments

(63)

where the elds ci1...in are the complex conjugate elds of ci1...in and the symmetrized
indices indicate in what representation of su(2)diag they sit. the superscript (1) and (2)
indicate that these are the fragments of the one-form and the two-form respectively. the
elds r are pseudo real, i.e.

ri1...in = i1j1 . . . injnrj1...jn .

(64)

for the choice of the coset generators (13) it is useful to introduce the indices (196) and
split

 = {a, a} ,
 = {ab, aa, ab} .

(65)

then one can do the decomposition (63) concretely by using the components of the 
matrices,

(66)

this shows how the decomposition (32) is done. the numbers  in (62) are obtained by
applying the matrix t8 in (27) on the components of  and . the scalar  does not
transform under t8 and hence  = 0. one may also verify that the above decomposition
(66) is in agreement with the su(2)diag matrices (27). the expansion in the harmonics

where the index structure on the harmonics d(s,t)()

some irrelevant signs in the front of the harmonics. we have absorbed these signs in the x elds.

with p constrained as in (48). we see that we have summed in the harmonic expansion a
multiple of times over the same irreducible representations of g when a given irreducible
representation of su(2)diag appears multiple times in the reduction g  h. the names
of the x-elds refer to names that were used in the papers [7]. for instance the x-eld h(0,0)
gives the masses for the spin-2 elds h, the x-elds aw will contribute to the vectors
a and w , and z will contribute to the vector z. so now, for a given representation of

in order to determine the mass spectrum we have to apply the invariant laplace beltrami
equations of table 2 to the harmonics in (67) which will then determine the masses of the
four dimensional x elds by means of the eq. (58). clearly, since we have a 1-dimensional,
a 7-dimensional and a 21-dimensional basis in (69) for the zero-form, the one-form and
the two-form respectively the matrices m(0)3, m(1)(0)2 and m(1)2(0) will be 1 1, 7 7 and
21  21. notice that for the two-form we will already need to handle a 21  21 matrix.
had we not restricted ourselves to representations made with s-spin and t-spin only, then
we would have had to handle a 41  41 matrix for the two-form. moreover we would
be over counting in the harmonic expansion. we then calculate the eigenvalues of these
operators and the masses are then found by using the mass formulas of [7].

in order to obtain the complete multiplet spectrum by the method of paper [13],
it is most convenient to have the eigenvalues of the spinor also. the spinor  is also
decomposed in irreducible representations of su(2)diag as follows,

( 1

(73)

the numbers  are read o from (29). then similarly as for the forms, the harmonic
expansion acquires the form,



 = (0,0)(x)  d(0,0)(0)(y) ,
(x)  d(1/2,0)(1)
i = (1/2,0)
i = (1/2,0)
(x)  d(1/2,0)(1)
ij = (1,0)(x)  d(1,0)(0)

for which we should nd an 8  8 matrix m(2)2(0).
at this stage we have all the ingredients to calculate the matrices m(0)3 , m(0)2(1),
m(0)(1)2 and m(1/2)3 . as explained before, it is possible to restrict oneself on the terms in
the expansion for a given irreducible representation of g. such representation is charac-
terized by the labels m1, m2, j, see (34). to do the calculation, we need to perform the
following steps:

1. invert (66). we know how the mass operators work on the the elds . they are

given in table 2. to see how they work on the fragments we invert (66).

18

2. for all of the fragments in (63) and (71) draw the young tableaux of d(s,t)(). check
whether it exists. solve the constraint (48) and then check the bounds (43) and (44).

3. apply the operators of table 2, by evaluating the covariant derivative (33) on the
young tableaux of the fragments. recall that these are not dierential operators.
all one has to do is to evaluate the operators t and do the multiplication with the
structure constants. to this end one can use the formulae (59) and (60).

all the above steps can be programmed in say mathematica. we assume that the bounds
(43) and (44) are satised and calculate the four contemplated operators. because of this
assumption these matrices are the matrices for the long n = 3 multiplets. indeed, since
all the possible fragments are present that implies that all the eld components of the
multiplets are present. we list the matrices in appendix a.

we nish this section by presenting the eigenvectors of the operators m(0)3, m(0)2(1),
m(0)(1)2 and m(1/2)3 , which is what we ultimately need for the masses. we use the notation

h0

2 + m1m2 + 3m1 + 3m2)  3j(j + 1)(cid:17) .

(76)

we write the subscript 0 to remember that this is the eigenvalue of the zero-form operator.
we denote the eigenvalues by (f )
 , where f = 0, 1, 2, s refers to the zero-form, the one-
form, the two-form and the spinor respectively and  enumerates its dierent eigenvalues.

5 shortening: the mechanism

the mass matrices that we have calculated and presented in appendix a are the mass
matrices for the long n = 3 multiplets.
in this section we clarify the mechanism by
which for certain representations of g, some of the components of the multiplet decouple,
hence multiplet shortening. we rst describe the general mechanism and we will illustrate
this then by means of some concrete examples: the graviton multiplet, the killing vector
multiplet and the betti multiplet. will see that the graviton multiplet has three gravitini
in the fundamental of so(3) and this will prove that the theory has indeed n = 3.
moreover, the case of the graviton multiplet will illustrate how to calculate the masses
for representations with non-zero u-spin.

to understand shortening we recall that the labels m1, m2, j, p, s, t, u of a given young
tableau are subject to the bounds (43) and (44) and to the constraint (48). the constraint
ensures the right u(1)-weight for the g-irrep. the bounds ensure the existence of a young
tableau that corresponds to them. the components of a multiplet that sits in a g-irrep
labeled by m1, m2, j are provided by the terms in the harmonic expansion with these
labels. there will be a priori a multiple of them for dierent values of s, t, u. however,
a given term in the harmonic expansion with particular labels s, t, u will only be there
if the bounds are satised. if not, it will mean that its corresponding component in one
of the multiplets decouples. thus it is useful to reformulate the bounds (43) and (44) in
such a way as to make the above mechanism more transparent.

to this end, remark that for a given s, t, u and , one can express the bounds (43)
and (44) as bounds on j in terms of m1, m2. this is useful to understand shortening
since what we are after is to nd a saturation of the unitary bound to get shortening. we
have summarized this in table 3 and in table 4, for all the values s, t, u and  that appear
in the decompositions (62) and (70). from these tables one can read o the bounds on
j. these bounds only depend on the numbers s, t, u and . the notation for the entries
should be understood as

(s,t,u) .

(114)

to see which of the fragments survive the bounds we now apply the two table 3 and 4
as if they were two sieves. we now illustrate how to use these table by some concrete
examples,

1. let us consider the g-irrep with

m1 = m2 = 0 ,

j = 0 .

(115)

sifting the fragments with table 3 we see that none of the fragments of the decompo-
1
sition survive the bounds except for 1(
,0,0),1(1,
2
then sifting the fragments with table 4, we see the of these fragments only

,0) , 0(0,0,0) ,1(

d(0,0)(0) appears.

2. let us consider

m1 = m2 = 0 ,

j = 1 .

(117)

(118)

(119)

(120)

this illustrates how, given a g-irrep, the fragments in the g  h that survive the bounds
can be obtained. in this way, one can study shortening for any such g-irrep given. yet,
this is not sucient to study shortening for the complete spectrum. to this end we need
to identify the series of g-irrepses that have the same content. before doing so, let us
restrict our attention to some of the above examples.

by means of the rst example we show that the spectrum that we have obtained now
is really the complete spectrum in spite of the fact that we have only been considering
harmonics with s and t indices. this we argued was valid for certain su(3)  su(2)
representations where m1 and m2 are big enough. here we show that the matrices that
we have calculated in the previous section can actually be used to obtain the eigenvalues
for all the other cases where m1 and m2 are not big enough. we will do this by means
of a concrete and particular relevant example: the massless graviton multiplet. moreover,
the subsequent material will also serve as a proof of the fact that the compactication on
ads  n 010 formulated as su(3)  su(2)/su(2)  u(1) and with the rescalings chosen
as in (24) has indeed n = 3 supersymmetry.
clearly, the massless graviton multiplet contains the graviton eld which is to sit in
the representation m1 = m2 = j = 0. applying the mass formula

m2

h = m(0)2 ,

(121)

we nd that it has mass zero. the gravitini and the graviphoton correspond to case we
already mentioned, m1 = m2 = 0 and j = 1,

1 

.

(122)

this is a case where m1 and m2 are not big enough to express everything in terms of
su(3) su(2) young tableaux with s-spin and t-spin only, as we have assumed in all the
previous discussion. we illustrate that the eigenvalues of the previous section can still be
used to derive the masses of the graviphoton and the gravitino.

24

let us rst consider the one-form. we show that it contains the graviphoton in its
harmonic expansion. it sits in in the fundamental of so(3). using the information in
(118) we see that in the reduction g  h, the representations (2, 0) and (2, 1) do not
appear. indeed, one can not put one su(2) index i in (122). the fragment (3, 1) appears
as (118), namely for the fragment r(1)
. this can be seen as the young
tableau

ij there is 1 i

j

(0,0,1)
ij

(0, 0, 1; 0)

(123)

where p = 1 is given by (48). let us now formally apply the generalized cyclic identity
(49) to this. we write,

(1,0)
ij

(0, 0, 1; 1)  2 (1/2,1/2)

(i,j)

(0, 0, 1; 1) + (0,1)

ij

(0, 0, 1; 1) .

(124)

clearly none of the above terms exists as a young tableaux, whereas (123) does. in order
to obtain the mass matrices for the one-form we should in principle derive the formulae of
the type (59) and (60) for the case u 6= 0. we argue now that such work can be avoided
by using the information that we have already obtained.
since all these formulas are linear one does not have to derive these formulae on the
young tableau (123), but one introduces the objects  even if they do not correspond to
an irreducible representation of su(3) su(2) with the denition that they transform as
in the transformation rules (59) and (60). then one uses the identity between (123) and
(124) and applies a and a to (124). even though the separate terms in the calculation
do not represent irreducible representations of su(3)  su(2) the sum of all of them on
the other hand will. concretely, following this line of argument, the harmonic expansion
for the 1-form can be written as,

ij = aw (0,0,1) (cid:16)d(1,0)
r(1)
are dened similarly as the -objects upon applying the cyclic identity

ij + 2 d(1/2,1/2)

 d(0,1)

(cid:17)

where the d(s,t)

ij

in order to exhibit the results for the matrices that we have already obtained in the

previous section, we consider m(0)2(1) for

m1 = m2 = 0 ,

j = 1 .

(126)

since the fragments c(1)
on the basis

i

and c(1)i do not get a contribution, we have to consider m(0)2(1)

only. hence, it is a 3  3 matrix

aw (0,1)

25

it is useful to realize that we can make change of basis in the harmonic expansion (67)
aw  = (p 1)t aw ,

r(1)
ij = aw t p 1  p dij .

where p is a 3  3 invertible matrix. let us take
1
2 1
0 1
1
1 4 1

p =

(129)

(130)

then the rst term in the harmonic expansion (129) gets the form (125). the matrix
(128) in the basis aw  gets the form,

m(0)2(1) =(cid:16)p 1(cid:17)t

m(0)2(1)p t =

48 0
0
0
0
0
0 96

(131)

so we see that the eigenvalue of m(0)2(1) for component aw (0,0,1) in (125) of the gravipho-
ton is given by the rst entry of the above matrix,

m(0)2(1) = 48 .

(132)

mind that the matrix p diagonalizes the matrix m(0)2(1).

as is known from [7], the mass of the vector a is given by the following mass formula,

m2

a = m(0)2(1) + 48  12qm(0)2(1) + 16 .

so we nd a massless vector indeed.

(133)

so far we have found only the vectors and the graviton of the massless graviton multi-
plet. still it is crucial to check that we have the right number of gravitini in this multiplet.
that will prove that we have indeed n = 3. hence, let us now consider the spinor. we are
interested in the representation (122). again there is only a contribution for the fragment
(3, 0) in the decomposition (70) and the treatment is the same as for the (3, 1) of the
one-form. indeed, there only appears the fragment ij in the expansion,

consequently, from the 8  8 matrix m(1/2)3 there is only the upper 3  3 matrix

ij + 2d(1/2,1/2)

ij

 d(0,1)

(cid:17) .

(134)

(135)

relevant for m1 = m2 = 0 and j = 1. we can diagonalize this matrix similarly by means
of the matrix p in (130) and we get,

m(1/2)3 =

2), 3(1), 1

we conclude that there are three massless spin- 3
provide the gravitini of the n = 3 massless graviton multiplet.
so we have found the massless graviton, gravitini and graviphoton of the n = 3
(cid:16)2, 3( 3
to complete the treatment of (126), we also consider the eigenvalues of the two-form
for this representation of g. as in the case of the one-form, the only fragments that
contribute are the ones with u-spin 1, i.e. for the representation (126) the 21 21 matrix
works on the basis,

following the same line of reasoning as for the one-form and the spinor, we introduce the

from this matrix we have to discard the eigenvalues

(142)

as being unphysical. only the rst two eigenvectors in p correspond to the two 0(0,0,1)
that we have found in the decomposition g  h in (62). so we see that the rst
eigenvector (corresponding to the rst row of the matrix p ) is the longitudinal unphysical
mode that corresponds to the one-form eigenvector that we obtained above. it has the
same eigenvector m(0)(1)2 = 48. furthermore, there is the eigenvalue m(0)(1)2 = 96 whose
eigenvector is an extra massive vector z with mass

m2

z = m(0)(1)2 = 96 .

(143)

as will be explained in [17] this vector is part of a massive gravitino multiplet.

to come back to our example m1 = m2 = j = 0, let us also consider the two-form for
this case. this yields the vector eld of the massless betti multiplet. indeed, then the
operator m(0)(1)2 acts on the component z (0,0)
only in which case is has eigenvalue zero.
so we nd the vector of the massless betti multiplet.

r

at this stage we have elucidated the examples (115) and (117). this yielded the
massless graviton multiplet and the massless betti multiplet.
it is also instructive to
consider example (119) a bit more closely, since it is in this irreducible representation
of g that we nd the massless vector multiplet which contains the killing vector of the
su(3) isometry.

to this end we have to consider the one-form. acting on the fragments with (120) it

it becomes the 3  3 matrix,

which has eigenvalues

m(0)2(1) = 48, 96, 128 .

 ,

(144)

(145)

the rst eigenvalue 48 according to (133), gives rise to a massless vector a. this is the
killing vector of the su(3) isometry.

6 the series

in the previous section we explained how the masses of the n = 3 theory can be calculated
from the matrices of appendix a when m1, m2, j are given. yet for a systematic study of
the complete spectrum we need to do this for all the irreducible representations of g. in
order to do so it is useful to arrange the representations that are allowed by the bounds
(43) and (44) and the constraint (48), into series that give rise to the same content of
fragments. this can be done most easily by using the tables 3 and 4.
first of all, notice that it is sucient to consider the cases where

m2  m1 .

28

(146)

indeed, the irreducible representations with m2 < m1 are the conjugate representations
of su(3) and hence correspond to the complex conjugate multiplets in the n = 3 theory.
reecting on the two tables 3 and 4 we conclude that we should make a distinction among
the following series r and en,

the series r is the regular series and contains the long multiplets. for the calculation of
the masses of the components, one takes the matrices in the appendix a. the series e
are the exceptional series. one may verify that in these exceptional series some columns
of the tables 3 and 4 are absent. in order to see which rows survive the bounds it is useful
to make a distinction between the cases

m2 = m1 + 3j ,

29

(162)

for j a non-negative integer. hence, the series (148) ... (161) have a dierent content
depending on the parameter j. we will denote them as ej
n. one may verify that it is
sucient to make a distinction between

we write e0

n, e1

n and en .

j = 0 ,

j = 1 ,

j  2 .

(163)

in order to determine the content of the series one can take a representative set of

number m1, m2, j for that series and do the following:

1. use table 3 and table 4 to determine which of the fragments are present. call this

set f .

2. consider each of the fragments (s,t,u) in f with non-zero u-spin.

if both the
fragments (s,t+1/2,u1/2) and (s+1/2,t,u1/2) are present as well then eliminate
(s,t,u). this has to be done because of the cyclic identity (49). otherwise we are
overly expanding. call the remaining set of fragments fc.

3. consider the fragments of fc with non-zero u-spin that are left. they can not be
eliminated. in fact they span a basis for the harmonics. however, in the spirit of
the previous section, they have to be expressed in terms of the objects  (that do
not correspond to young tableaux). all of this has to be done as explained in the
example of (117). we recall that this is to avoid unnecessary work. this determines
an unnormalized row vector of the conjugation matrix p . see for example (124)
and (125), where the row vector is
(1

2 1 ) .

(164)

4. for all the remaining fragments with zero u-spin, add the unit vector to p .

5. fill the rest of p in such a way as to get an invertible matrix. the choice of the

vectors is completely free as long as the matrix p becomes invertible.

6. apply p as in (131).

7. delete the unphysical row and columns of the resulting matrix. the rows and
columns that have to be deleted are the ones for which we had to insert the vectors
in step 5.

8. calculate the eigenvalues of this matrix. they have to be in the lists (77), (78)...(84),
(85)...(105) and (106)...(113). since we are doing this for specic values of m1, m2, j
we have to plug in these values also in these lists.

remark that after step 2, we have found a complete basis of fragments. given some values
for m1, m2, j, all the above steps can be implemented in a mathematica program. so it
is sucient to choose one representative m1, m2, j for the series in (148)...(161) and let
the computer perform these steps.

we now list the results of this. for the zero-form, the one-form, the two-form and the
spinor we list which of the eigenvalues are present and we give the masses of the elds
(see [6, 7, 13] for conventions concerning names)

h, , a, w, z, l, , s

(165)

that can be calculated from them.

30

6.1 the zero-form

the eigenvalue (0) of the zero-form (77) is only present in the series

r ,
e0
e1
e1 , e2 , e5 , e6 , e7 , e9 , e10 , e11 .

2 , e0

5 , e0

(166)

from the zero-form eigenvalue (0) we can obtain the mass of the spin-2 eld h and the
spin-0 elds  and s [6, 7, 13]:

m2

h = (0) ,

 = (0) + 176 + 24q(0) + 36 ,
s = (0) + 176  24q(0) + 36 .

m2

m2

(167)

so for each g-irrep in the series (166) there is a eld h, a elds  and a eld s with
masses as given in (167).

6.2 the one-form

we list which of the eigenvalues are present for the one-form. we use the notation of
(78)...(84). in the following tables we suppress the superscript (1).
for the series r all seven eigenvalues are present:

r 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

(168)

for the exceptional series with j = 0 we have,

mind that there are no values for m1, m2, j that match the series e0
14. indeed,
if j = 0 then (159), (160) and (161) would imply that j = 1 or j = 2. we have
indicated this in the table with empty. for the series e0
4 there exist values of m1, m2, j.
however, no eigenvalues (1) are present. we have indicated that with none.

from the one-form eigenvalue (1) we can obtain the masses of the vectors a and w ,

a = (1) + 48  12q(1) + 16 ,
w = (1) + 48 + 12q(1) + 16 .

(172)

so for each entry  in the above tables there is both a vector a and a vector w whose
mass can be obtained from  by the formulas (172).

6.3 the two-form

mind that besides the multiplicities in (173), there may be occasional multiplicities that
arise for certain values of m1, m2, j. if that occurs, then we have indicated it in the above
tables by writing the eigenvalues  with multiple indices. for instance, 1,2 in e0
5 means
that for the values m1 = m2  3, j = 1 we have (2)

from this one can obtain the masses of the vector eld z,

in (105).

1 = (2)

from the this one can obtain the masses of the spin- 3

2 eld and the spin- 1

2 eld l,

m = (s) ,

ml = (cid:16)(s) + 16(cid:17) .

(182)

(183)

so for each entry in the above tables there is the eld  and the eld l with masses
(183).

7 conclusions and outlook

to conclude this paper, we have calculated the operators m(0)3, m(0)2(1), m(1/2)2 and
m(0)(1)2 . for the long multiplets, they are listed in appendix a. we have found the
massless graviton multiplet with massless gravitini in the fundamental of so(3), hence
we have found the n = 3 graviton multiplet. this proves that the result is indeed n = 3.
we have also found the betti multiplet and the massless vector multiplet whose vectors
gauge the su(3) isometry. moreover, this serves as a check on our results. we explained
that the operators m(0)3, m(0)2(1), m(1/2)2 and m(0)(1)2 that are listed in the appendix
contain the complete information. we explained the mechanism for shortening and we
showed how the masses of the representations that contain u-spin can be obtained. we
identied the series of g-irrepses with a common eld content. we have formulated the
procedure to calculate the masses for all the shortened series. finally we listed the results
of this.

hence we have done everything that can be done concerning the harmonic analysis.
the next step is to draw group theory into the analysis to uncover the structure of the
n = 3 multiplets. this will yield a small zoo of new n = 3 multiplets beside freedman
and nicolais vector multiplet in table 1. then it will be easy to recognize these multiplets
as superelds on the n = 2 superspace of [20]. the invariant constraints that characterize
these multiplets can then be read o directly. all of this will be done in a forthcoming
publication [17].

a the mass matrices

in this appendix we list the operators m(0)3, m(0)2(1), m(1/2)2 and m(0)(1)2 for representa-
tions with s-spin and t-spin only, as output of the mathematica programs.

the eigenvalue of the operator m(0)3 is,

m(0)3 = h0 =

1 + m 2

2 + m1m2 + 3m1 + 3m2)  3j(j + 1)(cid:17)
