abstract

we study the non relativistic limit of a model of fermions interacting through

a chern-simons field, from a perspective that resembles the wilsons renor-

malization group approach, instead of the more usual approach found in most

texts of field theory. the solution of some diculties, and a new understand-

ing of non relativistic models is given.

models of a chern-simons [1] eld interacting with non relativistic bosons [2] or fermions

[3] have being studied in the literature both for its interest in general understanding of eld

theory by itself as for its application to condensed matter physics [4]. the use of these

models face in general, the diculties of their non renormalizability. this fact is perhaps,

the main reason for the interest, on the results of bergman and lozano [2], in one loop, later

extended to three loops [5]. their model consists of a non-relativistic boson eld  with a

the only primitively divergent green function is the boson four point function. up to one

loop, the model can be made nite by the choice of a renormalized coupling constant 

through the equation;

where  is an ultraviolet (uv) cut-o and m an arbitrary constant (the renormalization

constant) with dimension of mass. their main observation is that at the critical value,
 = | 2 e
m|, the one loop contribution vanishes and no renormalization of  is needed. at this
choice of  the model regains the scale invariance that it has at classical level, and the relative

wave function of the two bosons reproduces the aharonov-bohm scattering amplitude [8]

up two the second bohr order. the model of non relativistic fermions interacting with the

chern-simons eld was also discussed in [2] and studied in more details in [3]. in this last

paper it is shown that the one loop scattering of two fermions with spins of the same sign (in

2+1 dimension the spin is a pseudo-scalar) is nite in one loop, due to the contact interaction

represented by the pauli interaction, that is already present in the minimal interaction of

the fermions with the gauge eld. as for the scattering of two fermions of opposite spins

the pauli interaction does not have any role and the amplitude is divergent unless a quartic

fermionic interaction of the form c()   where  and  represent respectively fermions

with spin plus and minus 1/2, and c is a constant that depends logarithmically on the uv

cut o . this last fact poses a new problem. if the non relativistic model is thought to be

the low energy limit of a more fundamental model of relativistic dirac fermions interacting

with a chern-simons eld, in the way that this limit is generally taken in most texts [9],

it would come from a similar quartic interaction in the relativistic fermions. as is well

known one such interaction is non renormalizable! we will show that this is, in fact, a false

2

problem. no quartic non renormalizable self interaction is needed in the parent relativistic

model if a new perspective on the non relativistic limit in eld theory is taken. before going

to the description of this new limit, lets us briey resume, in an example, the classical

non relativistic limit, and discuss why it is not always correct. let us consider, in 2+1

dimension, a 2 component dirac fermion eld , that represents a spin plus fermion and

its anti-fermion, interacting with an external electromagnetic eld a, as described by the
lagrangian density (the gamma matrices are 0 .

= i1 and 2 .

= i2 where  are

the pauli matrices)

lrel =  (  i

the corresponding equation of motion is:

let us now consider a positive energy solution  of this equation.to make contact with the

non relativistic description,in which, the rest energy m of the particles is not included in the

solution,let us make in the above equation of motion ,the substitution

(9)

the essential facts behind the above non relativistic limit are the assumptions on the strength

of a and the momentum space support of the eld  (the second assumption is not mean-

ingfull without the rst, since a low energy initial state of  can be driven to a relativistic

state by the action of a strong a eld ). suppose now that a is not an external, controllable

eld, but is a dynamical eld with dynamics given by a maxwell or chern-simons term (that

must be thought as added to the lagrangian (3)). let us consider in this theory, the scatter-

ing of two low energy fermions, their energy and momenta given by (cid:16)p0 = m + |~p|2
2m ,~p(cid:17) with
|~p| << m . on the right side of figure 1 we draw a possible one loop contribution (among
others) to this process. the corresponding amplitude is given by a feynman integral in the

loop momentum k:

lowenergy =   z 
arelativ

d3k   

i

(k0 + p0)2  (~k + ~p)2  m2 !   

(10)

the main observation on this equation is that, even if the process we are treating is a low

energy one, the amplitude receives contributions of high energy intermediate states, repre-

sented by propagators whose dynamics is essentially relativistic, and so, not coming from

the feynman rules of the non relativistic lagrangian (9). the bigger or lower suppression

of the contribution of these high energy states depend on the dynamics of the exchanged

a eld. as we will explicitly see in one example below, for the chern-simons eld, they

eectively give a contribution that can not be understood as coming from the non relativis-

tic lagrangian (9). what about the description of this same process starting from the non

relativistic theory given by (9)? the amplitude for the same process of gure 1 is of the

form

4

nonrel =   z 
aclass

d3k   

i

(k0 + p0)  (~k + ~p)2/2m !   

(11)

where now p0 = |~p|2/2m. here also, the integral extends up to innity momenta. high
energy intermediate states also contribute to the amplitude, even with a bigger weight than

lowenergy, as seen from the worse uv behavior of the pauli-schrodinger(ps) propagator.

to arelativ
it must yet be observed, that from the view point of the special relativity, the ps propagator

misses to represent the propagation of high energy intermediate states. due to these facts,

some authors in field theory ( [10]) take the view of non relativistic field theory as a cut

o theory. this means that instead of considering ,in a wrong way, the contribution of the

high energy intermediate states ,they prefer to decouple them from the theory by limiting

the integration in the feynman integrals up to a maximal energy-momentum, compatible

with the newtonian description provided by the ps propagator. this is also a view taken by

some authors in optics ( [11]). there, the typical energy involved in the scattering processes

are of the order of the ionization energy of the atoms, 2 m, where  is the ne structure

constant and m is the electron mass. the cut o assumed is  =  m, the inverse of the

bohr radius of the atom, much bigger than the typical energies involved in the scattering

processes, and much smaller than the rest energy, m of the electron.

we will take a slight variation of these ideas, suited for understanding the results on non

relativistic models with a cs eld in the coulomb gauge, as treated in the literature [2, 3].

we will consider a non relativistic cuto, only in the spatial momentum ~k, of the feynman

integrals; that is, we will calculate the feynman integrals,rstly freely integrating the k0
momentum component up to innity, and then restricting the integration in |~k| to the region
(0 , ) with  chosen so that |~p| <<  << m, where ~p is a characteristic momentum of the
low energy process in which of interest, and m is the mass of the fermion eld. this choice

has the additional technical advantage of not breaking the locality in the time direction. the

way, we are proposing, that these cut o non relativistic models are related to originally

relativistic ones, is akin to the ideas of the renormalization group of wilson [12]. we will

rst outline the main ideas in a toy model.

5

lets us consider a relativistic eld theory in 1 space-time dimension, with dynamics given

by a lagrangian lrel(). its functional generator is given by

z(j) = z d(p) exp(cid:18)iz dp(cid:16)lrel() + j(cid:17)(cid:19)

(12)

where j is an external source, and d(p)
in describing non relativisticprocesses involving external particles with momenta p smaller

0 d(p). suppose that we are only interested

.

= q

than a certain value  << m, where m is the mass of the eld . this limitation can be

implemented in the functional generator by choosing the external source to be non null only

for the momentum region (0 , ). the  eld can be separated in (p) = (p) + (p) where
 has support in (0, ) and  in (,). the integration measure goes in d = d d ,
the lagrangian separates in lrel() = lrel( + ) = lrel() + l( , ) and j  gets
reduced to j . the functional generator becomes

z(j) = z d exp iz (cid:16)lrel() + j (cid:17) z d  exp iz (cid:16)l(, (cid:17)

and can be written in the form

z(j) = z d exp iz (cid:16)lef f ect(, ) + j (cid:17)

where lef f ect( , ) = lrel() + l( , ) and

z l( , ) = i ln(cid:18)z d  exp i z l( , )(cid:19)

(13)

(14)

(15)

the eects of the high momenta modes  are incorporated in the eective dynamic of the low

energy ones, through the additional term l( , ). it is the eective lagrangian, lef f ect ,
in which the only remaining free momemta modes are the non relativistic ones, and not the

original lrel , that will give, through the approximations called classical non relativistic
limit (exemplied above), the same results to low energy processes, as if calculated from

the original relativistic model.

the integration in  in (15) can in general be done by expanding the exponential in

a series of powers of r l( , ). the result will be a series of feynman graphs with the

6

propagator of  in the internal lines and the eld  in the external legs. this means that

the integration in the loop momenta is restricted to the interval (  ,  ). the result is
in general  dependent (as we will see the result of bergman and lozano is an exception)

resulting in an eective lagrangian lef f ect that is dependent on .

let us now return to the models that we want to treat in 2+1 dimensions. we will start

with the relativistic lagrangian

that we will represent by an dashed straight line. the fermionic ps propagator will be

represented by a single straight line.

we will leave the result above for future use, and return to the construction of the

eective non relativistic model. this will be done by calculating dierent low energy

processes in the relativistic theory and identifying the contributions that come from the low

energy intermediate states (and are the same that come from the classical non relativistic

model with a cut o ) and the contributions that come from high energy intermediate

states, and that must be incorporated in the eective non relativistic model, through new

terms in the lagrangian. we will restrict the calculations to the one loop order. the sum

of feynman graphs, written as a loop integral can be separated as

in the low momenta part, both |~p| and |~k| are smaller than  << m, and we can safely
make the approximation w(~q) = m + ~q2
2m, for both p and k. the propagators and vertices

collapse in the correspondent ones, got from the lagrangian (16). in the high intermediate

energy part this approximation can be taken for w(p) but not for w(k). as |~p| <<  and the
integral is for |~k| > , the result, h(p, ), is analytic in p and can be expanded in a series
in p. every term of this expansion is a contribution to the process, that can be represented

by a (new) local term in the lagrangian of the eective non relativistic model. the three

processes that require renormalization are the vacuum polarization tensor (figure 2) the

fermion self energy (figure 3) and the vertex correction (figure 4). the calculation, of

these quantities in covariant gauges are presented in many papers in the literature ( [13]).

in the coulomb gauge it was obtained in [6,7]. the results, separating the contributions of

the low (rst bracket) and of the high (second bracket) intermediate momenta contributions

as indicated in these formulas, all the contributions to these functions come from the

high momenta intermediate states. in fact it is well known that these same functions are

zero when calculated in the classical non relativistic model( [2]). as consequence the whole

contribution to these functions, come only from the high momenta intermediate states and

are independent of the cut o . the eects of these terms in correcting the low energy

dynamics of the fermions and the cs eld are simulated by adding to the lagrangian (19)

from (25) and (19) we see that the cs eld becomes a dynamical propagating eld, the so

called maxwell-chern-simons eld ( [1]). we can also see that the magnetic momenta of

the spin plus and minus fermions are corrected to ( [7])

(these results where obtained previously in the literature in covariant gauges( [13])).

let us now look at the elastic scattering of two low energy fermions. for simplicity we

will work in the center of momentum reference frame in which the incoming fermions

have energy and momenta: (m + ~p2

2m , ~p ) and the outgoing fermions have

for the scattering of one fermion of spin plus and other of spin minus, the contributions

of these graphs are listed below, separated in two rows. in the rst are the contributions of

the low intermediate momenta states, a(0, ), and in the second row, the local (independent
of p) contributions of the high momenta intermediate states, a(,).

some observations are in order: 1. the a(0, ) parts of each graph ( of the relativistic
model ) are the same as calculated from the classical non relativistic model (19) with a cut

o , through the graphs drawn on figure 5, at the right of the corresponding relativistic

ones. 2. the a(0, ) part of each graph can depend on the non relativistic cut o  (see
5e) but the whole graph is independent of  ,as can be seen by adding , for each graph,

10

the terms of the rst and the second row. 3. had we interpreted  as an uv cut o

in the usual way, i.e.   , and a(0, ) would be a divergent amplitude. 4. the
a(,) non null contributions of the graphs 5b and 5c could also be get by calculating
5a, starting from the already corrected eective lagrangian given by (19) plus (29). 5.

the non null a(,) part of diagram 5e instead, is a new term that must be incorporated
in the eective lagrangian as a local quartic interaction of the form  .
it must

be stressed that this term comes from the integration over the high momenta intermediate

states of the renormalizable relativistic model; no quartic term of the form   is

needed in the parentrelativistic model to generate this quartic term in the eective non

relativistic lagrangian. the eective non relativistic model incorporating all these terms

can be written

the calculation of the magnetic moment of the fermions, the propagator of the (maxwell)

chern-simons, and of the low energy scattering of two fermions, in this theory, using a cut

o  (up to one loop), give the same results as the calculation of the same quantities starting

from the relativistic model (16). for example, the amplitude of scattering of one spin plus

and one spin minus fermion ( the sum of the two rows in equation (27)) gives ( [14])

these results exemplify our main point: taking the non relativistic limit in the la-

grangian and equations of motion (classical non relativistic limit) and then calculating

a process gives in general, a result dierent than, rst calculating the same process in the

relativistic theory and later taking the non relativistic limit of the result.

to nish this talk i will turn to the problem that motivated this study: the nite result

nonrel got in ( [2]) for the scattering of two bosons and its extension ( [3]) to the

for aclass
scattering of two spin plus fermions (we will think that the two fermions are not identical

and we dont need to anti symmetrize the amplitude with respect to the outgoing particles).

the non null graphs contributing to this process are the same of gure 5. the result is

the dierences of these results to the ones in (27) come from the pauli interaction of the

magnetic eld of each fermion with the magnetic moment of the other fermion. the eects

of these interactions cancel in the scattering of a spin plus and a spin minus fermion and

the unexpected fact that this last result is nite, independent of , is in the literature ( [2])

related to the preservation at quantum level, of the scale invariance that the classical non

relativistic model presents. in the model of bosons interacting with the cs eld this only

happens for the special value of the quartic self interaction discussed in the introduction.

for fermions the same fact is provided by the pauli interaction which already appear in the

minimal interaction with the cs eld; no ne tuning of coupling constants is needed. we

here showed another aspect of this independence of . unusually,not only arelat
pendent of : their high and low momenta intermediate energy contributions are separately

lowen is inde-

independents of . so the dierence of the amplitudes got from the classical or the eective

non relativistic models is only a constant independent of . if the fermions are identical

we must anti symmetrize the amplitudes (32) and (29) in the outgoing particles. in this case

no dierence at all appears in the nal result. the amplitude got from both (32) and (33)
