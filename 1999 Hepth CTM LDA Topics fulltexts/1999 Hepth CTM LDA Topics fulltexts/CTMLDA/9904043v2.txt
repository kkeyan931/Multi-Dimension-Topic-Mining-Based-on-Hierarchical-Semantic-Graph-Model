abstract

by taking into account the eect of the would be chern-simons term, we

calculate the quantum correction to the chern-simons coecient in super-

symmetric chern-simons higgs theories with matter elds in the fundamen-

tal representation of su (n). because of supersymmetry, the corrections in

the symmetric and higgs phases are identical. in particular, the correction

is vanishing for n = 3 supersymmetric chern-simons higgs theories. the

result should be quite general, and have important implication for the more

interesting case when the higgs is in the adjoint representation.

chern-simons theories can give rise to particle excitations with fractional spin and statis-

tics, and thus have been used as eective eld theories to study the fractional quantum hall

eect [13]. they are also interesting when the higgs elds with a special sixth order poten-

tial are included so that the systems admit a bogomolnyi bound in energy [4]. the bound

is saturated by solutions satisfying a set of rst-order self-duality equations [5]. these so-

lutions have rich structure and have been under extensive study especially when the gauge

symmetry is non-abelian with the higgs in the adjoint representation [6]. it is known that

the self-duality in these systems signies an underlying n = 2 supersymmetry and thus the

bogomolnyi bound is expected to be preserved in the quantum regime [7]. furthermore,

when these theories are dimensionally reduced, an additional noether charge appears, which

in turns yields a bps-type of domain wall [8].

the quantum correction to the chern-simons coecient has also attracted a lot of at-

tention. for theories without massless charged particles and the gauge symmetry is not

spontaneously broken, coleman and hill have shown in the abelian case that only the

fermion one-loop diagram can contribute to the correction to the chern-simons coecient

and yields 1

4 [9]. the quantization of the correction can be understood with an topological

argument in the spinor space by making use of the ward-takahashi identity [10]. when

there is spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry, one can show that there exists in the

eective action the so-called would be chern-simons terms, which induces terms similar to

the chern-simons one in the higgs phase [11]. by taking into account the eect of the

would be chern-simons term, it has been shown that the one-loop correction in the higgs

phase is identical to that in the symmetric phase [12]. on the other hand, if the charged

particles, both scalars and spinors can contribute to the correction at two-loop level and it

is not quantized [13].

the situation becomes even more intriguing when the gauge symmetry is non-abelian:

the chern-simons coecient must be integer multiple of 1

4 for the systems to be invariant

under large gauge transformation; otherwise the theories are not quantum-mechanically

consistent. therefore, it is interesting to conrm that the quantization condition is not

2

spoiled by quantum eects. in the symmetric phase, this has been shown to one loop [14].

when there is no bare chern-simons term, it is also veried up to two loops considering only

the fermionic contribution [15]. in the higgs phase, it is known for some time that if there is

remaining symmetry e.g. su(n) with n  3, the quantization condition will still be satised

[1618]. however, if the gauge symmetry is completely broken, e.g. su(2), simple-minded

calculation shows that the correction is again complicated and not quantized [11]. although

one may argue that this arises because there is no well-dened symmetry generator in such

case, a better way to understand the whole thing is again to note the eect of the would

be chern-simons terms. they are invariant even under the large gauge transformation,

and their coecients need not to be quantized. therefore, we must subtract out the their

contribution to obtain the correct result. indeed, more careful calculation shows that for the

higgs being in fundamental su(n) the quantization condition is always satised whether

the gauge symmetry is completely broken or not [19]. as a result, a more or less unifying

picture of the quantum correction to the chern-simons coecient has emerged.

in pure non-abelian chern-simons theories, there is also the so-called regularization

dependence of the quantum corrections to the chern-simons coecient:

if we introduce the yang-mills term as a uv regulator, while

 = sign(cv),

 = 0,

if we do not [20]. here, cv is the the quadratic casimir operator in the adjoint representation

of the gauge group. further studies suggest that every local regulator manifestly preserving

brs invariance and unitarity would give rise to the same quantum correction [21]. inter-

estingly, it has been shown that n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills-chern-simons theory is

nite to all orders. [22] moreover, if the regulator is supersymmetric, the corrections become

regularization independent [23]. in particular, the corrections are vanishing for n = 2, 3

supersymmetric chern-simons theories. hence, we would like to know what happen if there

is also spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry in the system.

3

in this paper, we calculate the quantum corrections to the chern-simons coecient

in supersymmetric chern-simons higgs theories with the higgs being in the fundamental

su(n).

it turns out that the result is partially regularization dependent.

if we do not

introduce the yang-mills term, the quantum corrections are quantized and identical in the

symmetric and higgs phase because of supersymmetry. on the other hand, if we do, the

result is more complicated. for n  3, the quantum corrections are still identical in the two

phases. for n = 2, however, the quantum corrections becomes dierent in the two phases.

we conclude with some comments on its implication and possible future direction.

with matter elds in the fundamental su(n), the n = 3 supersymmetric nonabelian

chern-simons higgs theories can be simplied to [24]:

we will use the background eld gauge so that the eective action is explicitly gauge

invariant and the gauge elds do not get renormalized. this can be done by separating a

into the background part a and the quantum part q. in the higgs phase, 2 = 2 +

in our case, there are two relevant would be chern-simons terms:

respectively. we note that their transformation property under the su(n) symmetry are

dierent from the quadratic part of the chern-simons term. therefore, we will leave the

vev  in general form so that it is easier to extract the correction to the chern-simons

operators:

(p1)mn = mn  2[( t mt n ) + ( t nt m )] +

2(n  2)
(n  1)

( t m )( t n ),

(p2)mn = 2[( t mt n ) + ( t nt m )]  4( t m )( t n ),

to determine the renormalization of the chern-simons coecient, it is sucient to cal-

culate the parity odd part of the vacuum polarization. the three relevant diagrams are

shown in fig. 1: one with a gluon loop, one with a gluon-higgs loop and one with a fermion

loop [18]. after some algebra, we see that the vacuum polarization can be decomposed into

three parts:

[mn

 (p)]odd = p(cid:26)1(p2)mn +2(p2)[( t mt n ) + ( t nt m )]
+3(p2)( t m )( t n )(cid:27).

(10)

since the two would be chern-simons terms only contribute to 2(0) and 3(0), we only

need to calculate 1(0) to nd the correction to the chern-simons coecient. in the landau

both the results are identical to those in the symmetric phase. therefore, the degener-

acy between the symmetric and asymmetric vacua is preserved as we have expected for

supersymmetric theories. this is conrmed by calculating the eective potential of 2.

it is obvious that taking the limit that g   does not change the above result.

again, both the above results are identical to those in the symmetric phase. in the su(2)

case the gauge symmetry is completely broken, and there is no such a thing as unbroken

part in the higgs phase. as a result, the rst terms in eq. (16) should not have been there.

since ib(0) = 0 and thus the bosonic part is vanishing, the quantum correction to the

chern-simons coecient comes from the fermionic part only and is

n=3 =

n=2 =

(21)

both results are dierent from those in the symmetric phase. this indicates that the su-

persymmetry is broken when the gauge group is fundamental su(2). since the yang-mills

term itself does not respect supersymmetry, it is hardly surprising. the confusing part is

why this happens only for the su(2) case. one possible way to clarify the above confusion

is to do a derivative expansion type of calculation as in ref. [12].

the results that the quantum correction to the chern-simons coecient in supersym-

metric chern-simons higgs theories are identical in the symmetric and higgs phases is

interesting and have important implication.

it is well-known that non-abelian self-dual

9

chern-simons higgs theories with the higgs in the adjoint representation have rich vac-

uum structure. it has been quite a challenge to verify that the quantum correction to the

chern-simons coecient is quantized in these systems. if the results obtained above can be

generalized to the adjoint representation, we can calculate the quantum correction in self-

dual chern-simons higgs theories by calculating the fermionic part in the corresponding

supersymmetric chern-simons higgs theories. finally, although the calculation done here

is only for supersymmtric chern-simons higgs theories, we believe the results also apply to

supersymmetric yang-mills chern-simons higgs theories based on our experience from ref.

[23].
