abstract

we discuss the physics of a single dpbrane in the presence of a background elec-

tromagnetic eld bij. it has recently been shown [1] that, in a specic   0 limit,

the physics of the brane is correctly described by noncommutative yangmills theory,

where the noncommutative gauge potential is given explicitly in terms of the ordinary

u(1) eld. in a previous paper [2] the physics of a d2brane was analyzed in the sen

seiberg limit of m(atrix) theory by considering a specic coordinate change on the brane

worldvolume.

we show in this note that the limit considered in [2] is the same as the one described in

[1], in the specic case p = 2, rk bij = 2. moreover we show that the coordinate change

in [2] can be reinterpreted, in the spirit of [1], as a eld redenition of the ordinary

yangmills eld, and we prove that the transformations agree for large backgrounds.

the results are nally used to considerably streamline the proof of the equivalence of

the standard borninfeld action with noncommutative yangmills theory, in the large

wavelength regime.

1 introduction

in this short note we are going to examine the physics of a single at dbrane in the

presence of a large background electromagnetic eld. the problem has received lately

considerable attention and has been analyzed in complete detail in the recent work [1].

in particular it has been shown in [1] that, in order to describe the physics of the uc-

tuating electromagnetic eld, one has two equivalent options. on one side, one can

follow the standard treatment of the subject in terms of an ordinary u(1) gauge eld in

the presence of the background eld strength. on the other side, one can fully include

the eects of the background by rewriting the action in terms of a u(1) gauge eld of

noncommutative gauge theory. in this formulation, the background is used to dene a

poisson structure and a star product on the brane worldvolume, which are then used to

dene the noncommutative gauge theory. ordinary gauge transformations, which form

an abelian group, are replaced by noncommutative gauge transformations, which give

rise to a non abelian group. nonetheless gauge equivalent congurations are so in both

descriptions, and therefore the gauge orbits are the same in both cases. finally, in [1],

the authors identify a specic   0 limit in which the noncommutative description

simplies considerably and reduces to standard noncommutative yangmills theory.

in a previous work [2], a similar setting and limit was considered in the analysis of

the physics of d2branes in type iia string theory. the motivations for the analysis in

[2] are quite dierent from the ones in [1], and the discussion is driven by the attempt to

connect the physics of a d2brane to that of an m2brane in the 11dimensional strong

coupling limit of type iia. in particular, in order to connect with the 11dimensional

interpretation of the theory, it was crucial in [2] to treat on the same footing the directions

transverse and parallel to the brane. this can be achieved by changing coordinates on the

worldvolume of the brane, so as to eliminate any uctuation of the eld strength in favor

of uctuations of the induced metric. since the action governing the brane is invariant

under dieomorphisms, the coordinate change can be considered as a eld redenition,

and does not alter the physics. on the other hand, in terms of the new elds, the action

for a d2brane possesses a smooth polynomial limit in the 11dimensional limit of type

iia.

1

in this note we will show that the limit considered in [2] is that of [1] in the specic

case of a d2brane. moreover, we will show that the coordinate change considered in [2]

is the same, to leading order in derivatives, to the one considered in [1]. the result can

be understood as follows. as we have briey described above, and as we shall explain in

detail later, it is convenient to change coordinates in order to eliminate any uctuations

of the u(1) eld strength. this change of coordinates in not unique, but is dened up to

dieomorphisms of the worldvolume of the brane which leave invariant the background

eld strength 2form. the group of such dieomorphisms is non abelian, and has as

innitesimal generators the hamiltonian vector elds dened in terms of the background,

now considered as a symplectic structure on the worldvolume. these dieomorphisms

replace the ordinary abelian gauge invariance of the original theory, as in the case of

[1]. moreover, to leading order in derivatives, commutators in terms of the star product

considered in [1] are nothing but poisson brackets with respect to the symplectic structure

dened by the background. this explains why the change of coordinates is the same to

leading order.

given the above facts, we show that the results of [2], generalized to the case of a

generic dpbrane, can be used to streamline the proof of the equivalence of the standard

borninfeld action with noncommutative yangmills theory, in the   0 limit consid-

ered in [1]. moreover, in the large wavelength regime, the results in this note give a

clear geometric interpretation to the eld redenition given in [1].

we are going to use primarily the notation of [1], in order to allow a quick comparison

of the equations. moreover, given the nature of this short note, we are not including an

extensive reference list. for a more complete bibliography we refer the reader to the

papers [1] and [2].

2 the coordinate redenition

in this section we are going to analyze the physics of a at dpbrane in type ii string

theory, whose worldvolume is extended in the spacetime directions 0,    , p. we are not

going to consider the transverse motions of the brane, and therefore we will limit our

attention exclusively to the degrees of freedom of the u(1) gauge potential living on the

2

brane worldvolume. in particular we will analyze the dynamics of the dpbrane in the

presence of a large background electromagnetic eld.

we will denote with x i, i = 0,    , p, the coordinates on the target spacetime which are

parallel to the dpbrane. the worldvolume  = rp+1 of the brane can be parameterized

with the natural coordinates xi (i = 0,    , p) inherited from the target, which are dened

by

x i(x) = xi.

the embedding functions are therefore nondynamical, and all of the physics of the dp

brane (recall that we are neglecting transverse motions) is described by the uctuating

u(1) gauge potential. as we already mentioned, we are going to work in the presence

of a large constant background magnetic eld bij. we will assume in this paper that

the constant matrix b is of maximal rank. for the most part of what follows, we shall

actually assume that p is odd, and therefore that b is invertible (rk b = p+1). following

the notation of [1], we shall in this case denote with  = b1 the inverse matrix. at the

end of the section we will briey return to the case of even p (rk b = p).

let us denote with a = ai(x)dxi the uctuating gauge potential, and with f = da the

corresponding eld strength. the total eld strength is then given by

fij(x) = bij + fij(x) = bij + iaj(x)  jai(x).

(1)

we now change parameterization on the worldvolume  by choosing new coordinates

i. clearly the targetspace embedding coordinates are now given by

moreover the new eld strength is now given by

x i() = xi().

xk
i

xl
j fkl(x()).

(2)

efij() =

we claim that we can choose the coordinates  so that the the eld strength efij is given

by

efij() = bij.

(3)

in other words, we can eliminate any uctuation of the electromagnetic eld by a simple

coordinate redenition. in the new coordinate system i the dynamics of the brane is

3

not described by the u(1) gauge potential ai(x), but is now equivalently described by the
embedding functions xi(), which are now the dynamical elds.

let us start our analysis by considering small uctuations, and therefore by working

to rst order in ai. first let us dene the displacement functions

xi() = i + di().

for small uctuations, di is of order o(a). to rst order in uctuations equation (2)

becomes

efij = fij + ldfij = fij + dkkfij + fkjidk + fikjdk,

where ld is the lie derivative in the direction of the vectoreld di. using equations (3)

and (1), and recalling the antisymmetry of bij, we can rewrite the above (to order o(a))

as

fij = iaj  jai = bjkidk  bikjdk.

the above is an identity if and only if

ai = bijdj + i

(4)

for some scalar . therefore

up to transformations of the form

di = ijaj

di  di + ijj.

let us now move to the general case. suppose that we are given a generic gauge
eld ai(x), and a corresponding coordinate change xi() which satises (3). we can

then analyze, given an innitesimal change ai  ai + ai, the corresponding variation
xi  xi+xi. in fact we can use the results just derived above in the linear approximation.
first let us change coordinates from xi to i. the gauge eld uctuation ai(x) transforms

since, by construction, the eld strength in the coordinates i is equal to bij, and we are

as ai(x)  fai() = aj(x())ixj. we are now in the condition analyzed previously,
considering an additional innitesimal change fai to the gauge potential. we can now

4

use the above results on innitesimal uctuations to conclude that xi()  xi( + ),

where i() = ijfaj(). therefore xi = jjxi, and we have the relation

xi() = jkjxikxl al(x()).

(5)

we have seen before that, to rst order in ai, xi = i + ijaj. using this result and

integrating the above equation we conclude that, to second order in ai, we have

xi = i + ijaj +

1
2

ijkl (2alkaj + akjal) +    .

to make contact with the work of [1], let me dene the following variable

ai() = bijdj()

which is given, in terms of a, by the formula

ai = ai +

1
2

kl (2alkai + akial) +    .

(6)

we clearly see that, to rst nontrivial order in , the eld ai corresponds to the one
described in [1]. we will now better analyze this correspondence by describing how the

original gauge invariance of the theory manifests itself in terms of the new dynamical
elds di or, alternatively, ai.

the coordinate change from the variables xi to the variables i is dened so that the
electromagnetic eld, in the coordinates i, is given by the constant matrix bij. clearly
the choice of coordinates i is not unique.
in fact, given an innitesimal vector eld
v i(), we may dene new coordinates i + v i() which are equally valid if lv bij =
bkjiv k + bikjv k = 0. this is equivalent to the statement that the 1form bijv j
is closed, or that v i = ijj. the reparameterization of the worldvolume  can be
equivalently represented by a change in the functions xi() given by

xi  xi  jkjkxi = xi + i{, xi},

(7)

where we have introduced the poisson bracket

{a, b} = i ij iajb

5

on the brane worldvolume. note that

and more generally that

{i, j} = i ij,

{i, a} = i ijja.

written in terms of ai, equation (7) reads

ai  ai + i + i{, ai}.

(8)

let us mention, for completeness, the following consistency check. consider, in equation

(5), a variation ai(x) which is pure gauge ai(x) = i(x). it is then clear that, if we
dene () = (x()), we have that k() = kxlal(x()). therefore the variation of
xi() is given by

xi = jkjxik = i{, xi}

and is therefore pure gauge.

in the last part of this section we wish to connect the above discussion to that of [1].
in [1] the relation between a and a is derived starting from the knowledge of the correct
non abelian gauge invariance ai  ai + i + i[, ai], where [a, b] = a  b  b  a =
{a, b} + o(2). equivalently, we can start with the gauge transformation (8) and follow

the argument of [1] to derive (6). in fact, the computation is exactly the same, since all

the formulae are identical to rst nontrivial order in . in the treatment in this note the

noncommutative gauge group is the set of dieomorphisms of the brane worldvolume

which leave the 2form bij invariant. the group is innitesimally generated by the vector
elds of the form v i = ijj, which are nothing but the hamiltonian vector elds dened

in terms of bij, now considered as a symplectic structure on .

we have worked in the case of p odd. let me now very briey discuss the case of even
p, when bij cannot be invertible. divide the coordinates x i in x 0 and x a, a = 1,    , p

and assume that b0a = 0 and that bab is invertible. let us consider equation (4). for a

correct choice of  we can work under the assumption that a0 = 0. it is then clear that

we can solve equation (4) by imposing

d0 = 0

x0() = 0

(9)

6

and by choosing da = abab, where ab is the inverse of the invertible part bab of the

background eld strength. it is also clear that we can impose the constraint (9) not only

for small uctuations of the commutative gauge potential ai, but, in complete generality,

to all orders in ai (this is the choice discussed in [2], where the attention was focused on the

case p = 2 for physical reasons). the constraint (9) restricts the noncommutative gauge

group to the dieomorphism which leave the background eld strength and (9) invariant.

this group is generated by hamiltonian vector elds v i with v 0 = 0 and which satisfy
i = bijv j. this means that  is time independent and that we can essentially reduce

the problem by one dimension, therefore going back to the case previously discussed.

3 the   0 limit

in this last section we analyze the   0 limit considered in [1]. following the reasoning

in [2] and using the results of the last section we streamline the proof of the equivalence

of the standard borninfeld action with noncommutative yangmills theory in the large

wavelength regime. we will work again for convenience in the case p odd. this is done

both for notational simplicity and since the case p = 2 was treated in detail in [2]. in

what follows we shall closely follow the notation of [1] in order to make quick contact

with the results of that paper.

as in the last section we x the u(1) eld strength to be bij and consider as dynamical
elds the embedding functions xi(). following [1] we assume that the metric in the target

spacetime is given by

gij.

the induced metric on the brane is then given by

hij = ix kjx l gkl.

again as in [1], we consider the following limit1 (recall that we are considering the case

1the constant  in [2] is related to  in [1] by  = 4. with this redenition one can easily check that

the limit considered in [2] is exactly the same as that analyzed in [1], in the particular case of p = 2 and

rk bij = 2.

where we take   0. the tension of the dpbrane is given by t  1/(gslp+1

therefore scales as

t

we can then expand the borninfeld action as

s = tz

dp+1qdet(2bij) {x a, x c}{x b, x d}gabgcd +    .

the action scales as t () p3

2 (gab)2, and is therefore nite in the   0 limit, thus showing

that the borninfeld action does have a smooth polynomial limit, if it is written in terms

of the correct variables.

to make contact with [1], let us dene, as in the last section, the noncommutative

gauge potential ai by the equation

x i = i + ij aj.

if we dene the noncommutative eld strength by

we can readily check that

fij = i aj  j ai  i{ ai, aj}

i {x i, x j} = ij + ikjl fkl.

dene as in [1] the openstring metric

gij = (2)2bikgklblj
(2)2 ikgkllj

gij =

and the openstring coupling constant

gs = gsdet1/2(cid:16)2bikgkj(cid:17)

it is then quick to check that

(cid:18) 1

2(cid:19)2

{x a, x c}{x b, x d}gabgcd = (2)2 gabgcd fac fbd + const. + total derivative.

therefore the action s becomes

is the noncommutative yangmills coupling, which is independent of .

this then concludes the proof of the equivalence of the commutative and noncommu-

tative descriptions in the large wavelength approximation. it is uniquely based on the

invariance under dieomorphisms of the borninfeld action. this fact both simplies

the proof considerably and also claries the geometric nature of the eld redenition to

leading order in the derivative expansion. let me also note, as a conclusion, that the

analysis and the results in [1], restricted to the description of at d2branes, do give a

formal and complete proof of the conjecture stated in [2].
