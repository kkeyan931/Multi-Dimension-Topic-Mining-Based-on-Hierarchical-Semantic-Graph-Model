(1) 1 g metric string frame. dilaton, h anti-symmetric tensor f electromagnetic eld strength. action dipole solution found . eld congurations dipole given by: ds 2 = ( + a2sin2 r2 a2cos2 (r2 a2cos2)2 ), = log r2 a2cos2 + a2sin2 = 4am rsin2 + a2sin2 , = r2 2m r a2. (2) (3) solution written einstein-frame. einstein-frame metric (g) related string-frame metric g = eg . first all, notice metric asymptotically at. dilaton also goes constant r becomes large. furthermore, asymptotic behaviour gauge eld reveals dipole nature solutions. dipole moment read 4am eld conguration. understanding metric, would look region = 0, = 0 = 0, = possible locations singularities. done blowing coordinates near corresponding points. example, near = 0, = 0, dene coordinates  (r0 2m )sin2 = (1 cos), 2(r r0) = (1 + cos). (4) here, r0 = + 2 + a2 root = 0. near region = 0 (keeping asin2 r r0 nite), eld congurations reduce to: )1dt2 + (1 + ds 2 = (1 + ), = (1 cos). = log(1 + )(d2 + 2d2 + 2sin2 d2), ricci scalar easily calculated metric given r = 2 2( + )3 . 2 (5) (6) thus, near = 0, metric behaves anti-monopole heterotic string theory. hand, blow coordinates near r = r0, = . similar computation reveals structure monopole near region r = r0, = . analyse heterotic dipole string frame. field congurations string frame read (2) making necessary metric scaling. ds 2 = dt2 + sin2(r2 a2cos2)2 ( + a2sin2)2 d2 + (r2 a2cos2)2 + (m 2 + a2)sin2 ( dr2 + d2), e = = r2 a2cos2 + a2sin2 4am rsin2 + a2sin2 . see non-zero electro-magnetic eld strength components fr = 4am (r2 + a2cos2)sin2 ( + a2sin2)2 , f = 4am rsin2 ( + a2sin2)2 . (7) (8) (9) metric analysed near = 0, exactly terms coordinates (t, , , ). near = 0 takes form: ds 2 = dt2 + (1 + )2(d2 + 2d2 + 2sin2 d2), = log(1 + ), = (1 cos). (10) curvature scalars related metric near = 0, example, r = 2m 2 ( + )4 , rr = 2m 2(32 + 2m + 2) ( + )8 . (11) thus notice near = 0 curvature components nite. heterotic string coupling g case given e 2 . (8) see large r, coupling g goes constant normalised 1 solution. however, see (8), vanishes, g diverges = 0, . thus solutions given make sense. because, one expects, large g, action (1) would receive non-negligible corrections. discuss consequences later. also notice r 2 0 pgd goes 3 zero r r0. means r = r0, actually string joining = 0 = . metric string follows (7) ds2 = dt2 + 0 a2cos2)2 (r2 (m 2 + a2)sin2 d2. one thus calculate length string l = z 0 pgd = 1 2 + a2 z 0 r2 0 a2cos2 sin d. (12) (13) clearly innity. however, noticed earlier string coupling diver- gent ends string. one calculate ux associated string integrating around coordinate = z 2 0 ad = 8m r0 . (14) 3. sl(2, r) transformed solutions: last section, saw eective string connecting monopole, anti- monopole system diverged consequence string coupling becoming strong near poles. however take conguration slowly decrease string coupling g sl(2, r) transformation. since, heterotic string theory self-dual four-dimension, sl(2, r) transformed string-frame metric elds would continue solution theory. furthermore, since particular choice sl(2, r) metric inverts string coupling, new coupling would nite small every where. thus rst discuss special class sl(2, r) transformed solution labeled parameter 0 (see  constructional detail ). = , get conguration new string coupling inverse earlier. follows, rst construct sl(2, r) transformed solutions discuss behaviour light section 2. this, remember heterotic string anti-symmetric three rank tensor eld h shown explicitly (1). earlier discussion, set h zero hence appear explicitly solutions (2)-(3). however, generic sl(2, r) transformation indeed excite eld. 4 given solutions (7)-(8), easily generate subclass sl(2, r) dual solutions. string frame, various elds new solutions given by: sin2(r2 a2cos2)2 (r2 a2cos2)2 + 2( + a2sin2)2 ds 2 = d2 , dilaton axion elds respectively e = = (r2 a2cos2)2 + 2( + a2sin2)2 (1 + 2)( + a2sin2)(r2 a2cos2)  . (r2 a2cos2)2 + 2( + a2sin2)2 , (15) (16) furthermore, electro-magnetic eld components calculated formula f dened f = 1 1 + 2 (f + f ). f = 1 2 gg g f. (17) (18) straight forward compute various components f using formula, display here. however, notice generic values sl(2, r) parameter , f electric well magnetic components. (16), dened ge2 = gggh. terms coordinates (t, , , ), (15) takes form (19) ds 2 = ( + )2 + 2 2 (1 + 2)( + )2 dt2 + ( + )2 + 2 2 (1 + 2)2 (d2 + 2d2 + 2sin2 d2). (20) easy check curvature components associated metric nite. also notice new string coupling g = e , g goes 1 large r. secondly, nite , = 0 , g nite. thirdly, = , g = g1. hence, new coupling becomes weak = 0, . many nice features. firstly, r = r0, before, proper length along direction goes zero. thus still string like structure ending = 0 . string described metric ds2 = (r0 2 a2cos2)2 + 2a4sin4 (1 + 2)(r0 2 a2cos2)2 5 . (21) one calculate length string l| = 2a2 2 + a2 . (22) limit 0, (22) l = 2a. conclude, summarize done note. section 2, analysed heterotic dipole four dimensions would probed fundamental string. noticed string (ux line) connecting two poles soliton. however, due string coupling becoming strong near poles, length string turns innite. section 3, analysed dual version solution. constructed exploiting sl(2, r) self-duality property heterotic string four dimensions. dual description, string coupling well- behaved along string joining monopole, anti-monopole pair. consequence, found length string nite. acknowledgement: would like thank cesar gomez, bert janssen shibaji roy useful conversations. work supported ministerio de educacion cultura spain also grant cicyt-aen 97-1678. 6
