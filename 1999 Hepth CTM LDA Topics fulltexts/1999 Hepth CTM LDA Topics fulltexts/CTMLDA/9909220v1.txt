abstract

the issue of dening discrete light-cone quantization (dlcq) in eld theory as a light-

like limit is investigated. this amounts to studying quantum eld theory compactied on a

space-like circle of vanishing radius in an appropriate kinematical setting. while this limit is

unproblematic at the tree-level, it is non-trivial for loop amplitudes. in one-loop amplitudes,

when the propagators are written using standard feynman -parameters we show that, gener-

ically, in the limit of vanishing radius, one of the -integrals is replaced by a discrete sum and

the (uv renormalized) one-loop amplitude has a nite light-like limit. this is analogous to

what happens in string theory. there are however exceptions and the limit may diverge in

certain theories or at higher loop order. we give a rather detailed analysis of the problems

one might encounter. we show that quantum electrodynamics at one loop has a well-dened

light-like limit.

1. introduction

light-cone quantization is based on the idea that one might use the light-cone coordinate
x+  x0 + x1 as time and the corresponding p+  p  as hamiltonian. discrete light cone
quantization, or dlcq for short, in addition takes x  x0  x1 to be compact, i.e. to take
values on a circle of radius r0: x  x + 2r0. one should note that the value of r0 has
no invariant meaning since the proper length of this circle is zero. the value of r0 can be

changed at will by a lorentz transformation.

one may view this setup as resulting from a standard quantization with an ordinary time
t  x0 and compactied space-like coordinate x1 through an innite lorentz boost. more
precisely (see section 2) one starts with a space like circle of radius r = r0: x1  x1 + 2r0
with small but nite . through a large lorentz boost this is mapped to an almost light-like
circle. in the   0 limit, the lorentz transformation becomes innite and the circle truely
light-like. it has been proposed [1] to use this procedure as a denition for the dlcq: carry

out the quantization of a given theory compactied on a space-like circle of radius r0. if the
theory is lorentz invariant and if the   0 limit exists, the latter provides a clear denition
of the dlcq of the same theory.

in particular this procedure should also provide a straightforward way to transpose the

standard renormalisation into the dlcq. this would be an advantage with respect to certain

current dlcq treatments of qcd where renormalisation often looks a bit ad hoc.

unfortunately, at present, it is not clear for which quantum theories this light-like (  0)
limit exists. recent interest in this question arose in the context of the dlcq of m-theory
[2,3,4]. however, it was pointed out in [1] that already in the simple 4-theory the 4-point one-
loop amplitude diverges, as   0, if no momentum in the compact dimension is transferred
across the loop. these authors [1] advocated that this problem is generic, except in certain

susy eld theories.

lateron it was shown that this problem does not occur in type ii superstring theory and
that there the   0 limit exists, at least at one loop [5]. it was argued that the same should
also hold at higher loops and even non-pertubatively, and hence probably also in m-theory [6].

it appeared from these studies that the mechanism did not mainly rely on susy cancellations

as might have been expected from [1] but was more stringy in nature.

1

one might wonder whether the eld theory limit (  0) of the   0 limit of the
string amplitude gives a nite result or whether some divergence appears. since the resulting

eld theories are highly supersymmetric and hence rather non-generic, we have prefered to

study general quantum eld theories directly, trying to follow as much as possible the string

computation. it is well known that a string one-loop amplitude can be rewritten as a quantum

eld theory one-loop amplitude but with an innite number of particle species running around

the loop. the string loop amplitude contains an integral over the moduli r of the punctures

(localisations of the external propagators on the torus). the eld theory analogue of the
in the string computation [5] the   0
limit gives rise to a complex -function eliminating the integration over one of the moduli

complex r are the real feynman r-parameters.

r, replacing it by a nite sum. the resulting amplitude is nite except for precisely those

singularities required by unitarity.

we will show here that similarly in quantum eld theory the e  0 limit gives rise to a
now real -function. generically, this -function eliminates one of the integrations over the

feynman parameters r, replacing it by a nite sum, the resulting expression having again

only the singularities required by unitarity (after renormalisation).

this is the generic situation. if however no external momentum in the compact direction

ows through the loop, then the argument of the -function can be vanishing, the (0) signalling
a divergent   0 limit. this is precisely the situation that was encountered in [1] for the
4-theory. in 3-theory this may not happen at one loop. indeed, since the external lines must


have non-vanishing momenta in the compact direction,

for any theory with cubic vertices only

these momenta always ow through the loop. in particular, we show that the light-like limit

exists for qed at one loop. we also discuss some subtleties related to renormalisation.

at higher l-loop order the situation is less clear. again, the generic situation is straight-

forward: there is one real -function for each loop, eliminating l integrals over r-parameters.

this is quite encouraging for the string case of [5] where the higher loop case is technically

more involved. but we also encounter non-generic situations (even in theories with cubic ver-

tices only) where a loop subgraph inside a bigger loop has vanishing compact momenta on its
external legs (which are just internal lines of the bigger loop). in this case the   0 limit

 as will be explained in section 2, this is necessary in order to correspond to nite energy states in the

dlcq.

diverges. although this is likely to ruin the existence of the light-like limit beyond one-loop,

there might be cancellations that save it. clearly a more detailed analysis is needed beyond

one loop to provide a clear answer, whether and for which theories the dlcq may be dened

as a light-like limit to all orders in perturbation theory.

in section 2, we begin by setting up the relevant kinematic framework. in section 3 we
study the scalar 3-theory in quite some detail, while in section 4 we extend these results to

quantum electrodynamics. section 5 contains some discussion.

2. kinematics

we will start by considering a particle of mass m descibed in a coordinate system (x0, x1, xi)
with i = 2, . . . d1, in a d-dimensional space-time with signature (+. . .). x0 is time and the
spatial coordinate x1 takes values on a circle of radius r = r0. all other spatial coordinates
xi, called transverse, as well as the time x0 are ordinary non-compact coordinates:

x0  x0

,

x1  x1 + 2r0

,

xi  xi .

(2.1)

the momentum for an on-shell particle is

p1 = p1 =

n
r0

,

pi arbitrary ,

p0 = [p2

1 + p2

i + m2]1/2  |n|

r0

.

(2.2)

at this stage n is any integer, positive, negative or zero.

now perform a lorentz boost with boost parameter  = 12/2

1+2/2 . if  is small, this is a large
boost. in the new coordinate system x it is convenient to dene x = (x0  x1)/2. then

simply x+ = 

2(x0 + x1), x = 1

 (x1  x0) with periodicities

x  x + 2r0

,

x+  x+ + 2r0 .

the corresponding transformed momenta are

p+ =

1


(p0 + p1) =

p0
 

n

2r0

,

p =

(p1  p0) =

.

(2.3)

(2.4)

remember that p0  |n|
p+ is a priori o(1/2).

r0

and hence p0 is o(1) while p0



is o(1/2), so that p is o(1) and

3

equation (2.3) shows that the light-cone coordinate x is periodic as we want, but also x+

has a (small) periodicity which is unwanted. this can be eliminated by a further coordinate

redenition (not a lorentz transformation). let

t = x+ 

2
2

x ,

x = x  t  t

,

x  x  2r0 .

(2.5)

then t is a non-periodic coordnate and x has the desired periodicity. the metric is

ds2 = 2dtdx  2(dx)2  (dxi)2

(2.6)

so that the circle in the x direction is not exactly light-like. it becomes truely light-like in
the limit   0. this is to be expected since the original circle (2.1) has invariant length
2r0 and a light-like circle must have zero invariant length. the   0 limit gives the dlcq
setting. in the coordinates (2.5) the momenta are

pt = p+ =

p0
 

n

2r0

,

p = p 

2
2

p+ =

n
r0

.

(2.7)

hence p = n
r0

as expected in the dlcq.

it is now easy to see that n must be positive if m 6= 0 and non-negative if m = 0.
let rst n 6= 0. then, expanding the square-root in (2.2) for very small : p0 = p0 =

|n|
r0

+ r0

2|n| (p2

i + m2) + o(3) and hence

pt = |n|  n

i + m2) + o(2) .
(p2

(2.8)

hence states with n < have innite dlcq energy pt as   0, wile all state with n > 0 have
nite pt. let now n = 0. then p0 = (p2
 . hence the only state with
n = 0 and nite dlcq energy pt must have m = pi = 0, i.e. is degenerate with the vacuum.

i + m2)1/2 and pt = p0

in the following, we will work in the coordinates (2.1), i.e. with a space-like circle of radius
r = r0. in the   0 limit this is lorentz equivalent to the dlcq with radius r0. we have
just seen that nite dlcq energies for on-shell states require the restriction n > 0. hence
we will be interested in n -point amplitudes in quantum eld theory with all external states
having strictly positive momenta in the compact direction, p1
and study their   0

3. scalar quantum eld theory : 3

the simplest quantum eld theories to study are the scalar 3 or 4 theories. we already
know [1] that the simplest one-loop diagram in 4, namely the 4-point amplitude, diverges as
  0 if n1 = n2, n3 = n4. we will study instead 3 theory which does not present this
pathology. in the course of our investigation we will also better understand the origin of the
problem of 4. the same problem will occur for all k theories with k  4. however, since
many interesting theories, like qed, only have cubic vertices it is useful to study the 3 theory

in some detail.

3.1. the 2-point one-loop amplitude

we will begin with a very detailed computation of the simplest one-loop diagram: the
two-point function. this will exhibit the basic mechanism of the   0 limit. if we call the
external momentum p and the loop momentum k then the relevant self-energy diagram is

i(p ) =

1
2

2m4dz ddk

(2)d

1

(k2  m2)((p  k)2  m2)

(3.1)

where 1
2 is the symmetry factor. we work with dimensional regularisation. (the coupling
constant  has dimension of mass as approriate in d = 4.) upon compactifying x1 on the
circle of radius r0 we have to replace k1  n
r0 pn. we further do a
wick rotation to euclidean signature and denote k  (k0, ki). the external momentum is
p 1 = n
r0

and r dk1  1

and p. thus

r0

(p ) =

2m4d

r0 (cid:17)2
 + m2(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:16) nn

+ (p  k)2 + m2(cid:21)

. (3.2)

note that although the external n is positive, the n of the loop momentum has no a priori

reason to be restricted to positive values only.

(3.6)

the   0 limit has produced a -function which eliminates one of the integrations over
(n n) =

the -parameters (here the one over ) and replaces it by a discrete sum. indeed



 this point is slightly delicate: as long as we have euclidean signature, p 2 is a sum of positive terms,
and if (p 1)2 = n 2
0   there is no way p 2 can remain nite if all components are real. but we have to
2r2
keep in mind that ultimately we are interested in minkowski signature in which case p 2 is nite provided
p 0 = n
r0

+ o() as discussed in section 2.

 clearly, if n = 0 one is in trouble. the problematic situation in 4 corresponds eectively to the
n = 0 case with no external discrete momentum owing through the loop. here however, n > 0 and the
problem does not arise.

propagators are thus restricted to non-negative values. there is a slight subtlety here: n = 0

(3.7)

note that the somewhat ambiguous terms n = 0 and n = n are independent of the external

momentum p and thus can be absorbed into the mass renormalisation.

renormalisation in d = 4

in d = 4, (p ) is logarithmically divergent. setting  = 4d

with

m2 =

2(4)2 (() + log(4)) .

(3.8)

(3.9)

the innite part of (p ) is m2 and is cancelled by a mass counterterm +m2. we note that
the latter does not depend on n, i.e. is independent of the external momentum p as it should.
also note that n = 0 and n = n actually do not contribute to the nite part (p ) + m2.

we may shift any nite constant between the nite part of (p ) and m2. if we impose

the standard renormalisation condition r(p2 = m2) = 0 then it is easy to see that

r(p ) =

n

n(cid:17)i(cid:27) .

(3.10)

the terms n = 0 and n = n have disappeared from the sum. this means in particular

that after renormalisation the discrete components of the propagators in the loop are strictly

7

positive, just as is the case for external on-shell states. this is an important feature of the

dlcq loop diagrams. however it appears below that this seems not to hold for higher-point
one-loop diagrams in 3. note that this implies r(p ) = 0 for n = 1.

from eq. (3.10) it is clear that the two-point function has branch cuts starting at p 2 =

n 2

of two on-shell particles with p1

n(nn) m2 for n = 1, . . .(cid:2) n

2(cid:3). this is easily seen to correspond to the threshold of production
so far, all is satisfactory: the   0 limit exists, the mass counterterm does not depend on
n, the internal propagators have strictly positive n, and the renormalised two-point function

(1) = n

(2) = nn

r0

and p1

r0

.

has the appropriate unitarity cuts.

renormalisation in d = 6

d = 6 is the critical dimension of 3 beyond which it is not renormalisable, so it is interesting

to look at this case as well. let now  = 6d

2 . then (p ) diverges quadratically and (3.8) is

replaced by

(p ) =

(3.12)

again, m2 does not depend on n, but (z  1) does. although this dependence disappears at
large n as it should, it is likely that this n-dependence of the wave-function renormalisation

constant z signals some inconsistency. it is not clear to us whether and how this could be

resolved.

3.2. n -point one-loop amplitudes

the basic feature that has emerged from the above computation was the appearance of

a -fct whose argument involves a certain combination of -parameters and external discrete

momentum quantum numbers nr, allowing to trivially perform one of the -integrations. it

is clear that the same will happen for any one-loop diagram with cubic vertices only. the
purpose of this subsection is to actually perform the calculation for an arbitrary number n
of external legs in the 3-theory and check that there are no hidden diculties. we will give

much less details than in the previous subsection. we will be interested in 4 dimensions so
that all one-loop n -point functions with n  3 are uv convergent. otherwise, for d = 6, one
could use dimensional regularisation for the 3-point function, all others being nite.

the main technical issue for the n -point function is to nd the most convenient change
of variables for the -parameters so that the -function can be used eciently to eliminate

one integration and the resulting integrals are over a simple domain. the correct change of

variables is inspired from the string computation [5].

let the external momenta be pr, r = 1, . . .n , all taken to be incoming. momentum
then are positive, a negative

r=1 pr = 0. obviously, not all p1

r = nr
r0

conservation then is pn

nr just means that we are actually dealing with an outgoing particle rather than an incoming.
however, all nr are non-vanishing. the momentum of the rth propagator in the loop then is

kr = k  p1  . . .  pr1 = k + pr + . . . + pn .

(3.13)

using -parameters the product of the (euclidean) propagators is

the domain of integraton of the i is 0  1  2  . . .  n 1  1. if the integrand were
symmetric under permutation of any two i one could instead integrate over the full hypercube
0  1, 2, . . . n 1  1 (and divide by n !). but permuting i and j does two things:

it

permutes pi and pj and it changes the sign of the ji. the latter is easily xed by writing
|ji| instead. the former is more interesting. we should really compute the n -point one-loop
greens function. this is obtained from a single diagram by adding all permutations of the

external lines, i.e. by adding all permutations of the pi. to avoid overcounting, one has to

keep one external line (say pn ) xed, and moreover divide by 2 to avoid counting a diagram
and its mirror image twice. this bose symmetrisation thus precisely amounts to extending
the integration range of the i, i = 1, . . .n  1 to the full hypercube. thus the correct greens
function is (not writing any coupling constants explicitly):

it is straightforward to check that for n = 2 this coincides with eq. (3.6) (after doing the
-integral, and up to the coupling constant we have dropped).

 as before we assume that all pi  pj have nite limits as   0. this is in particular the case if all pi are

on shell, cf eq. (2.9).

11

at this point we can use the -function to trivially do one of the r-integrals. in terms of

the initial r-parameters this would have been most complicated. we choose to eliminate the
n 1 integration. to do so, we introduce the notation {x}f , meaning the fractional part of
x, i.e. {x}f = x + n for some n  z and {x}f  [0, 1). then n 1 only takes the following
|nn 1| discrete values

although this nal expression looks asymmetric between the n th, the (n  1)th and the other
external legs, it is clear from the derivation that it is completely symmetric. this will also be

obvious for the examples considered below. it is a perfectly well-dened expression and we see
that the   0 limit exists for the n -point amplitude under consideration. of course, gn has
those cuts required by unitarity. we have already seen this for n = 2.

as an explicit example one may take the triangle diagram, n = 3 in d = 4. recall that in

this case 3 = 1. let 1  , so that 2 = l

for xed l, as  varies from 0 to 1, l

2 will be discontinuous whenever n1 is an integer, so
that to actually evaluate the integral, the interval [0, 1] has to be split into pieces. if we take
e.g. n1 = 2, n2 = n3 = 1 only l = 0 is present and 2 = {2}f so that we have to split

12

the interval into [0, 1

2 ] and [ 1

2 , 1].

it is easy to see that both pieces actually give the same

contribution and, after wick rotating back to minkowski signature, we get

(3.27)

where we used p2

2 + p1  p2 = p2  p3. this expression is manifestly symmetric under exchange

of p2 and p3 as it should since n2 = n3. the integral is elementary and can easily be done.

however, we already see from (3.27) that a branch cut will start whenever the square bracket
in the integrand is zero at the boundary of the integration interval. at x = 0 it is just m2 6= 0,
but vanishing at x = 1 gives p2
1 = 4m2, giving the branch cut as expected. indeed, an incoming
n1 = 2 state can split into two states with n = 1 > 0 each. note also that there are no cuts
in p2
3 and this is in agreement with the fact that |n2| = |n3| = 1 cannot split into two

2 or p2

states both with n > 0.

it is interesting to trace back what are the discrete components of the loop momenta that

contribute. one of these is n as entering the argument of (n +pi ini). when 1  2  . . .
this n corresponds to the propagator between the rst and the n th external line, but after bose
symmetrisation (any conguration of the i  1) this can correspond to any of the internal
propagators. the -function implies n = pi ini = nn  nn 1l
i=1 ini. for
the above example with n = 3 and n1 = 2, n2 = n3 = 1 this gives n = 1 + 2  2 =
1 + {2}f  2 = 1  [2], hence n = 1 for   [0, 1
2, 1). we see
that, contrary to what happened for the renormalised two-point function, internal propagators

n 1 pn 2
2 ) and n = 0 for   [ 1

do occur with vanishing discrete momentum.
in this example, it is clear from momentum
conservation around the loop that one cannot have n1 = 2, n2 = n3 = 1 with all discrete
loop momenta strictly positive (for a given time slicing). another example is n = 3 with
n1 = 4, n2 = n3 = 2 and l
2 = ({4}f + l)/2, l = 0, 1 and hence n = 2 + l  [4] which
takes the values 1, 0, 1, 2, 3. the only way to evade the conclusion that internal propagators
may have vanishing (or negative) discrete momentum would be to show that these diagrams

actually vanish. but the above explicit example (3.27) tells us that this is not so.

3.3. 3 beyond one loop

beyond one loop the situation is less clear. naively, we proceed in exactly the same way,

and expect that the mechanism that produced the -function at one loop also operates here

giving one -function for each loop, so that l -parameters will be discretised. however,

looking more carefully, we see that one important ingredient at one loop was that the external
momenta are such that the pr  ps have nite limits as   0. recall for example eq. (3.3)
for (p) where we used that n 2
 = p 2 is nite. if this self-energy diagram appears as
2r2
0
an insertion in some internal line with momentum k of another loop, then we have (k), i.e.
p  k, n  n and there is no reason why n2
 should be nite as   0. this does
not mean that we cannot take the   0 limit but it might be dierent from what one naively
expects. let us proceed anyway.

consider some l-loop diagram with n external lines. then there are i = n + 3l  3
internal propagators. as before they are rewritten using i -parameters. the exponent then

is some quadratic form in the l loop momenta ki, i = 1, . . . l, and in the external momenta
pr, r = 1, . . .n , with coecients that are functions of the s. just as one completes the
square for k at one loop, one successively completes the squares for the l ki, starting with k1,
then for k2, etc. for the non-compact directions one then shifts the integration variables k
i
to k
(analogue
of k1 = n

(3.28)

in practice one would like to nd the most convenient change of variables s  s analogous
to (3.15), (3.19). as a matter of principle, however, this is not necessary. all we need is a

subset of l s (label them 1, . . . l) such that

(3.29)

so that we can solve the constraints imposed by the -functions in terms of the 1, . . . l.

rather than trying to analyse this condition in general we consider a specic two-loop example.

 the denition of the f 2

j will have to take into account terms like the above-mentioned n2.

+ k2

take the one-loop two-point function (p ) computed above with internal propagators having
momenta k and p  k. in one of the loop propagators, say the one with momentum k, insert
again this same (k). the external momenta of the inserted sub-loop then simply are k
and k. the discrete component of k is k1 = n

 is somehow resolved. the condition (3.29) then in particular means
that the -function appearing in (k) can be used to eliminate the -integration appearing
in (k). we have seen that this is the case if k1 = n
6= 0 (now n plays the role of n
r0
in the previous section, we have shown that in the renormalised r(p ) only n =
above).
1, . . . n  1 contribute (recall that p 1 = n
). thus n 6= 0, and the full (renormalised) two-
loop diagram (probably) has a well-dened nite limit as   0. however, this example does
not represent the generic situation: consider inserting a one-loop two-point function (k) into

. suppose the problem mentioned above of

r0

r0

any of the internal propagators of the triangle diagram. as we have discussed at the end of the

previous section, in this case it appears the possibility that one of these internal propagators
has vanishing discrete momentum so that the inserted (k) is taken at k1 = 0 and thus its
  0 limit diverges.

4. qed

the purpose of this section is to show that the same mechanism that worked for the scalar

3 theory also works in a realistic theory containing fermions and having gauge invariance.

we will explicitly study the behaviour of two uv divergent one-loop diagrams in qed

in four dimensions, namely the vacuum polarisation and the electron self-energy. then we

will comment on the other one-loop and on higher-loop diagrams. as before, we work with

dimensional regularisation performed on the wick rotated euclidean integrals.

4.1. vacuum polarisation

the vacuum polarisation diagram (p) has a supercial degree of divergence 2, but it
is well-known that (p) = i(pp  gp2)(p) with (p) only logarithmically divergent. in
the present case, the discrete component is p1 and we must treat 11, 1i and ij (i, j = 0, 2, 3)

we note two things. again, the terms n = 0 and n = n do not contribute to (p) or z3  1.
again also, the counterterm z3  1 explicitly depends on n. as in the 3 theory, the rst
fact is encouraging, while the second is puzzling. lets compare with the standard (euclidean)

result in the non-compact case. there

we encounter an interesting subtlety. in both cases the numerator of (4.1) contains a term

needed for the n = 0 term which is no longer present.

4.3. other one-loop and higher loop diagrams

while the other one-loop diagrams (vertex function, etc) are technically more involved, in

particular due to the -matrix algebra, there are no new diculties to be encountered



and

 a minor complication arises when one wants to extend the integration domain of the i from 0  1 
2  . . .  n 1  1 to the full hypercube 0  i  1. in the scalar 3 theory this was achieved by
bose symmetrisation. here, in qed one has to separately bose symmetrise external photon lines, and
separately antisymmetrise incoming and outgoing fermion lines. as a result, we do not get the same
type of compact expression with the i all integrated over the hypercube. this is easy to see for the
vertex function. nevertheless, one can still use the -function to eliminate one of the i which is replaced
by a nite sum, although the lower and upper bound of the sum now depend on the other integration
variable(s). in the case of the vertex function one can very explicitly evaluate the diagram in the   0
limit, which is indeed nite, and study its properties.

18

we can safely conclude that all one-loop amplitudes in qed have a nite light-like limit. as
in 3-theory, the situation beyond one loop is less clear.

5. conclusions

we have studied the issue of dening discrete light-cone quantization in eld theory as a

light-like limit. while this limit is unproblematic at the tree-level, it is non-trivial for loop

amplitudes. we have seen that in theories with cubic vertices only, and in particular in qed, all

one-loop amplitudes have a nite and well-dened light-like limit (provided the external states

have non-vanishing discrete momenta which is the appropriate kinematic setting corresponding

to the dlcq). moreover, we have seen that these amplitudes have exactly the cuts required by

unitarity. when they are written using standard feynman -parameters, we showed that the

only thing that happens in the light-like limit is the replacement of one of the -integrals by a

discrete sum. this is analogous to what happens in string theory. these one-loop amplitudes

are actually often easier to compute explicitly than the standard ones since they involve one

less integral.

there are however some puzzling features: we have seen in the examples of the scalar

self-energy (in d = 6) and the qed vacuum polarisation diagrams that certain counterterms

depend explicitly on n, i.e. on the discrete component of momentum of the external particle.

it is not clear to us whether and how this might make sense. also, while for the self-energy

diagrams all internal discrete momenta are strictly positive, this is not always the case for the

higher-point functions (vertex function, etc).

related to this last point, we have argued that beyond one loop we are probably going

to encounter problems and the light-like limit is likely to diverge, although a more detailed

analysis is needed to settle the question. it should be noted that the troublesome situation

occurring at two and more loops is very specically eld theoretic and does not aect the

conjectured existence of a light-like limit of string theory to all orders in perturbation theory

[6].
