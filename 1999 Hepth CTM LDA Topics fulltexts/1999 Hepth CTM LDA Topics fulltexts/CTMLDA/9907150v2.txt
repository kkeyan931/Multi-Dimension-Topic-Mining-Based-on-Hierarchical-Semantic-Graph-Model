abstract

recently much work has been done in lowering the planck threshold
of quantum gravitational eects (sub-millimeter dimension(s), horava-
witten fth dimension, strings or branes low energy eects, etc.). working
in the framework of 4-dim gravity, with semi-classical considerations based
on hawking evaporation of planckian micro-black holes, i shall show here
as quantum gravity eects could occur also near gut energies.

1 introduction

as it is well known, the standard picture of supersymmetric gut models pre-
dicts that the coupling of the three gauge interactions (electromagnetic, weak
and color) unify to a good accuracy at an energy around 2  1016 gev. gravity,
on the contrary, presents another natural energy scale: quantum uctuations of
the gravitational eld seem to become important only when we observe them
at the planck length lp = (gh/c3)1/2 = 1.6  1033 cm. energy uctuations of
2 (hc5/g)1/2 = 6  1018 gev create at this scale microblack
the order of ep = 1
holes that modify the topology of the spacetime. at the same scale, follow-
ing the common views, gravity coupling (that is the strenght of gravitational
interaction) should become comparable with those of the other three gauge in-
teractions.
during the last years, studies based on string theories have changed this vision
[1]. in the early times of superstring theory, it was usual to associate it with
(sub)planckian physics, because the theory provided an ultraviolet regulator of
quantum gravity. more recently, a number of authors have considered the pos-
sibility that the compactication energy scale is far lower, with a fundamental
scale of string theory being as low as tev. since the gauge couplings are in-
versely proportional to the volume of compactication space, this implies large
compactication volumes and therefore large extradimension(s). by modifying
the compactication radius one can tune the couplings of gauge interactions,
including gravity.
in the brane-world picture the gauge interactions are localized on p-branes

(with p  9) while gravity propagates in dierent spacetime dimensions. pre-
cisely, gauge elds and particles with gauge charges move only on the walls
(i.e. on p-branes) while gravity moves also in the bulk, the spacetime region
whose the p-branes are the boundary [2]. in the horava-witten proposal the
branes represent 3+1 dimensional walls in which all the standard model parti-
cles live, while gravity moves in the 4+1 dimensional bulk between the walls.
the other six additional dimensions of string theory should be much smaller
than that inhabited by gravity. the wall is then 9+1 dimensional in all and
the complete spacetime is 10+1 dimensional. one can choose the size of the
11th dimension (the one inhabited only by gravity) so that the gravity coupling
meets those of the other three forces at the same common scale, presumably the
gut scale [3]. and the couplings of the other interactions remain untouched
by this extra dimension.

2 gravity coupling from micro-black holes

the purpose of this section is to show how the threshold of quantum gravi-
tational eects could be considerable lowered from mp lanck to almost mgut ,
without the use of large extra dimensions, of 11 dimensional m-theory or of
horava-witten model. working in the framework of semiclassical 4-dim grav-
ity, a careful analysis brings to the conclusion that quantum gravity eects could
be present also at the gut scale.
let us begin by reminding the process of creation of a planckian micro-black
hole. we can use the heisenberg inequality px  h/2 casted in the form
ex  hc/2 (because e  cp in our high energy situation) to observe that
in a space region of width x the metric eld can uctuate with an amplitude in
energy of e  hc/2x. if the gravitational radius rg = 2ge/c4 associated
with the energy e equals the width x of the space region, a micro-black
hole originates [4]. this happens when x = lp and the typical energy of the
process is of course the planck energy ep . planckian microholes are therefore
typical quantum gravitational objects.
we want now to calculate the lifetime of one of these microholes. this can be
done in at least three dierent ways. the rst is to follow the pure thermo-
dynamical approach of the semiclassical hawking decay [5]. of course many
criticisms can be raised towards this approach, mainly because the extremely
high energy situation seems to forbid any semiclassical calculus and even the use
of the notion of temperature. the second method is to follow a microcanonical
approach [6], which, using the microcanonical ensamble, avoids the problematic
use of the concept of temperature at these very high energies. the third way
is to make use of the semiclassical hawking decay, but corrected with opportune
factors in order to account for the great number of decay channels (i.e. species
of particles) that the microhole can radiate into during the nal stages of its
(short!) life.
although the microcanonical approach seem to be the more appropriate for this
high energy situation, it is based on an exponentially rising density of states,

which is interpreted by considering black holes as extended quantum objects
(p-branes). we want on the contrary to work in a completely non-stringy en-
vironment and to remain in the realm of standard model and 4-dim gravity, in
order to test how non-stringy physics can tackle the problem of gravity coupling.
therefore we choose here the third method of calculus.
let us start with the thermodynamical approach and introduce after the multi-
channels correction factor. the lifetime of a black hole of given initial mass
m0, loosing mass via hawking radiation can be calculated in a simple manner.
using the stefan-boltzmann law

w = t 4

we can say that the variation dm of the mass of the hole in a time dt is

dm = 

t 4s
c2 dt

(1)

(2)

where s is the surface of the hole and t is the hawking temperature. for a

schwarzschild black hole we have

s = 4r2
g

with rg =

2gm

c2

and t =

hc3

8kgm

.

the equation in dm becomes

dm = 


m 2 dt

with

 =

h4c6

283g2k4

 3.93  1024 g3s1.

this gives the mass of the hole at time t

m (t) = (m 3

0  3t)1/3

and therefore the lifetime of the hole is

t0 =

0

m 3

=

283g2k4

h4c6

0

m 3

.

in particular for a micro-black hole of a planck mass, m0 = mp = ep /c2,

we obtain for the lifetime

t0p =

h3c2

(

gh
c5 )1/2

 2.01  103p

(8)

where p = (gh/c5)1/2 is the planck time. (remember that ep p = h/2).
the precendent derivation, making use of the stefan-boltzmann law, takes into

3

account only the pure electromagnetic black body emission (i.e. photons). in
order to consider also other particles species, we have now to introduce a multi-
channels correction factor, fc. the equation (4) now reads

dm = 

fc
m 2 dt

(9)

where fc accounts for the degrees of freedom of each emitted particle specie
contributing to the energy loss. various forms have been proposed for fc
[7].
in the standard model picture fc never exceeds a value of order 102 (and also in
a supersymmetric picture fc is again of this order of magnitude). the equation
(8) hence becomes

t0p 

2.01  103

fc

p .

(10)

we note now that, in absence of gravitational eects, an energy uctuation
of the same size of a planckian micro hole would have a lifetime of just only
one planck time (if we take into account the heisenberg principle only). the
decay time is slowed down by the presence of the event horizon of the micro hole,
which traps the energy and emits it only at a slow rate via hawking evaporation.
thus we can consider the quantum micro hole, which has a lifetime of the order
of 20p , as a sort of metastable quantum state. from the theory of the decay
of metastable states [8] we can infer that the decay probability dp of a state
during the time interval (t, t + dt) is proportional to

exp[


h

t]

(11)

where  is the width in energy of the state. the mean lifetime of the state

is

 =

h


.

(12)

we know that the lifetime of the metastable micro hole quantum state is t0p

and from here we can calculate its width in energy

0p =

h
t0p

=

2  ep fc
2.01  103 = 6  1015fc gev.

(13)

for fc of the order 102 we obtain 0p = 6  1017 gev. this width is so huge
that should allow the existence of planckian micro-black holes also at the gut
threshold or very near to it, quite below the planck threshold.
incidentally, it is also interesting to note that, by reversing the argument, we
can obtain a valuation of the number of particles species present in nature. in
fact, if we demand that

0p = ep  egut

we get then fc  996.

3 conclusion

the gut energy scale seems to emerge in a natural way from a careful analysis
of the micro-black hole metastable quantum state. this seems to indicate that
typical quantum gravity objects can be present also at energies well below the
planck threshold, and this result is obtained in a completely non-stringy frame-
work. the quantum gravity scale could be xed at the gut scale (almost)
and no more at the planck scale. this agrees also with the simplest inationary
potential invoked to explain the density uctuations as measured by cobe (see
banks et al.

[1]).
