abstract

two classes of conformal field theories have been proposed to
describe the hierarchical quantum hall eect: the multi-component

bosonic theory, characterized by the symmetry du (1) dsu (m)1 and the

w1+ minimal models with central charge c = m. in spite of having
the same spectrum of edge excitations, they manifest dierences in
the degeneracy of the states and in the quantum statistics, which call
for a more detailed comparison between them. here, we describe their
detailed relation for the general case, c = m and extend the methods
previously published for c  3. specically, we obtain the reduction in
the number of degrees of freedom from the multi-component abelian
theory to the minimal models by decomposing the characters of the
du (1) dsu (m)1 representations into those of the c = m w1+ minimal

models. furthermore, we nd the hamiltonian whose renormalization
group ow interpolates between the two models, having the w1+
minimal models as infra-red xed point.

1 introduction

the low energy edge excitations of incompressible quantum hall uids
[1] are one-dimensional chiral waves which propagate on the boundary of the
sample. these could be described by (1 + 1) dimensional eective conformal
eld theories [2]. moreover, this eective approach to describe the low en-
ergy physics, is in accordance with the high precision and universality found
experimentally in the structure of the plateaus for the hall conductivity.

the lling fractions of the more stable plateaus are given by the jain

series [3]:

 =

m

mp + 1

,

(1)

with m = 1, 2, 3, ... and p = 2, 4, 6, ....this corresponds to the majority of the
lling fractions observed experimentally in the range 0 <  < 1 ; therefore,
its study and comprehension is very relevant in the quantum hall eect
problem. for the laughlin case with lling fraction  = 1
p+1 (m = 1),
the corresponding conformal theory is the abelian chiral boson one, which
describes the universal properties of the quasi-particle excitations; these are
in agreement with the laughlins microscopic theory for the charge spectrum
q and the quantum statistics / [4].

in contrast to the laughlin case, general hierarchical hall plateaus, whose
lling fractions are given by the jain formula (1) for general m 6= 1, are not
well understood yet. at the moment, two classes of conformal eld the-
ories have been proposed. the rst is the multi-component bosonic the-
(more specically

m

ory, characterized by the abelian current algebra du(1)
du(1) dsu(m)1 ), which is a natural generalization of the abelian case made

by m copies of the one component theory [5]. the second one is given by the
minimal models of the w1+ symmetry algebra [6], based on the dynamical
symmetry of classical incompressible uids under area-preserving dieomor-
phisms [7].

the spectra of these two types of theories are identical, but they dier
in the degeneracy of their excitations. this can be tested by computing
numerically the energy spectrum for the hall states of a few electron system.
this kind of study has shown a reduction in the number of degrees of freedom
compared to the abelian theory, which is in agreement with the prediction
of the w1+ minimal models [8]. this result motivates our analysis of the

1

general hierarchical problem.

further important dierences between the two theories are that the min-
imal models exist for the hierarchical plateaus only, and that they possess
a single abelian charge, rather than the m charges of the abelian multi-
component theory. moreover, the minimal model quasi-particles possess a
type of non-abelian statistics: actually, they are labelled by the weights of
the su(m) lie algebra instead; the multi-component theories, on the con-
trary, they are characterized by the (m  1) abelian charges.
the connection between the two types of theories has been explicitly
found in ref.[9] for the c = 2 and c = 3 cases. by introducing the bosonic
fock space and by using the algebraic methods of representation theory,
it is possible to show that the minimal models correspond to a sub-set of
the states of the abelian theory. this reduction in the number of degrees
of freedom can be performed by adding an interaction term to the original
hamiltonian: this is relevant in the renormalization-group sense, such that
the corresponding ow interpolates from the multi-component abelian to the
minimal theories in the infra-red.

the purpose of this paper is to generalize these results to any c = m > 3.

in section 2 we include a brief summary of the c = 2 theory results. in

section 3 we present the decomposition of the du(1)  dsu(m)1 characters

into those of the c = m w1+ minimal models and the hamiltonian that
interpolates between the two theories..

2 the c = 2 case: minimal model and two

component abelian theory

the two component abelian theories are built out of two chiral bosons
(i), i = 1, 2, which are dened on the edge of the hall sample, which we
take as a disk parametrized by a radius r and an angle  [2]. the chiral
currents j (1) and j (2) associated with these bosonic elds describe the edge
excitations; their fourier modes (i)

precisely, the du(1) du(1) representations are characterized by the eigenvalues

of the (i)

lattice  ; each lattice represents a single theory. we can choose a particu-
lar class of lattices whose lling fractions match the jain series and whose
representations allow the previously mentioned extension of the symmetry

the corresponding spectrum of quasi-particles with  = 2/(2p + 1) is

with a simple change of variables, this spectrum can be decomposed into
charged and neutral sectors. the new integer quantum numbers l and n are
dened by n1 +n2 = 2l+ and n1n2 = 2n+ , with  = 0, 1; the spectrum
of charges and quantum statistics is divided into two parts with parity

after this change of variables, the neutral and charged excitations are

indeed factorized.

the number l counts the units of fractional charge and the number n la-
bels the neutral quasi-particles. in this context, p has a clear meaning related
to the compactication radius of the eld ((1) + (2)), which represents the

charged sector of the theory ( du(1)diagonal).

it is useful to introduce the currents and the virasoro generators whose

eigenvalues are labelled by the new quantum numbers l and m:

2(cid:16)j (1)  j (2)(cid:17) ,

j = j (1) + j (2) ,
j 3 = 1

each value of the spectrum corresponds to a highest weight state of the

tower of states on top generated by the action of (i)

abelian current algebra du(1) du(1); each highest weight state has an innite
up to now we did not make explicit the extended symmetry du(1) 
dsu(m)1. the natural way to proceed is to incorporate two additional chiral

currents of dimension one [10]:

which is the su(2)1current algebra. therefore, it is clear that the extended
symmetry is a consequence of the choice of the particular lattice  .

so far, we described the hall uid with  = 2

2p+1 in terms of the rational

conformal eld theory du(1)diagonal  dsu(2)1 . next, we compare this theory

with the alternative minimal models of the w1+ algebra [9]. a detailed
description of the incompressible uids by w transformations and the def-
initions of the w1+ algebra is given in [6]. here, we just summarize the
main properties which are useful in our analysis.

in general, the c = m w1+ unitary representations are of two types:
generic or degenerate. the generic w1+ theories are equivalent to chiral-
boson theories; these have the same spectra of lling fractions, fractional
charge and statistic of excitations. for the c = 2 case the representations

0

of the abelian algebra du(1)  du(1) with charges (n1, n2) (eigenvalues of j 1
and j 2
0 ) are one-to-one equivalent to those of the w1+ algebra satisfying
(n1  n2) / z . on the other hand, the degenerate w1+ representations
are not equivalent to the abelian ones, and are contained into them, their
charges (n1, n2) satisfy (n1  n2)  z . a remarkable property of the degen-
erate representations is that they correspond one-to-one to the hierarchical
plateaus and are thus physically relevant [6]. the c = m w1+ degenerate

representations are equivalent to the representations of the du(1)  wm alge-
bra, where wm is the zamolodchikov-fateev-lukyanov algebra at c = m  1
[11]. the su(m) quantum number associated with the neutral sector we
mentioned before arises from the fusion rules of the wm algebra, which are
isomorphic to the tensor product of the su(m) lie algebra representations.

in the c = 2 case [9], we have

degenerate w1+ reps = du(1)  vir reps

where the du(1) abelian algebra corresponds to the charged sector and the
w2  virasoro algebra accounts for the neutral one.

(11)

5

the spectrum of the w1+ minimal models is the same as that of the

0, 1, 2, ...: each point of the lattice dened by the numbers n, l, corresponds

du(1)diagonal  dsu(2)1 theories (5-7), with the integer n restricted to n =
to one degenerate w1+ representation, while in the du(1)  dsu(2)1 this is a
du(1)  du(1) representation with the same virasoro weight.
using the characters of the dsu(2)1representations with isospin  = /2 =

0, 1/2 and the virasoro representations h = n2/4 [12] [10] it is possible to
count the number of edge excitations in the neutral sector, which is dierent
in the two theories [9]. their expressions are:

(12)

it is convenient to relate them to the characters of du(1) representations

the above relations correspond to the following decomposition of dsu(2)1
representations into du(1) and virasoro ones:
xs=0
{ = 0} dsu (2)1
2(cid:27)
(cid:26) =

these expressions show: rst, that the two dsu(2)1 representations sum

= xkz even (j 3

up the neutral spectrum of the abelian theory in the two sectors, type i
and ii, for  = 0 and 1/2 respectively; second, that the multiplicities of the
decomposition into virasoro representations match the familiar multiplicities
(2s + 1) of the su(2) lie algebra representations. we see that the minimal
models contains the virasoro h = s2 representations with multiplicity 1, while
the su(2)1 theory contains (2s + 1) of them. therefore, one can obtain the

(17). the evident consequence of the incorporation of the constraint is the
breaking of the su(2) symmetry and the xing of the u(1) quantum number
m = s .
results we just described. first, let us consider the standard du(1) du(1)

this is diagonal in the previous (m, s2) basis, and assigns the energy [m(m+

 has dimension of a mass which assures the relevancy of the term in the
renormalization-group sense. for    , it selects the lowest weight in
each su(2) multiplet, m = s, in other words, implements the constraint
[9].
therefore, the infra-red limit of the theory dened by the hamiltonian
h + h is the c = 2 w1+ minimal model. this infra-red xed point is

known exactly and is conformally invariant because hj +
0i = 0 .the
group interpolates between the du(1)  dsu(2)1theory (  0) and the c = 2
minimal model (  ) . the fact that the conformal eld theories are
describing the low energy edge excitations, makes physically signicant this
infra-red limit, which is reached without any ne-tuning.

and we complete the description including the hamiltonian point of view.

the degrees of freedom from the du(1) dsu(m)1 to the c = m w1+ minimal
as we mentioned in the introduction, the du(1)  dsu(m)1 theory can be

built out of m chiral bosons dened on the edge of the hall sample. the zero
modes of the chiral currents j (i), i = 1, ...m, associated with these bosons,
span a m-dimensional lattice. from the set of possible lattices, we choose
the particular class, in which the lling fractions correspond to the jain
series  = m/(mp + 1). these lattices imply the symmetry extension from

to perform the factorization into charged and neutral sectors, we introduce a

(26)

which means that the m-ality is invariant under the addition of a vector in
the root lattice . we will denote p the m sub-lattices of p with the given
value of  of the m-ality. now, the factorization into charged and neutral
sectors is obtained by the change of basis :

for the purpose of comparison of the dsu(m)1 and wm neutral spectrum,

the last expression is not yet completely appropriate;
it is convenient to
consider an -dependent change of basis, making explicitly the m-ality of
the theory. we modify the previous transformation, (taking into account the

for the minimal models we consider the characters of the degenerate wm

(37)

for both characters, (34) and (37), it is possible to establish a relation with

the characters of du(1)

m1

representations, as follows:

su (m)1

m1 xkiz

qh ,

(38)

where we consider the value of h (32) which corresponds to the sector j .
finally, as in the c = 2 case, we can relate the characters of the two

theories in a direct way:

12

j

(39)

with  = {ki/ 2ki  ki1  ki+1 + li  0} and as in (38) h given in (32)
which corresponds to the sector j.
the two last identities have been checked with the help of the program
mathematica [15] for m = 3, 4, 5 by an expansion in powers of q . we nd
for the general c = m theories the following identities:

dimsu (m)() {l0 = h}wm

{j} dsu (m)1

= xkiz {h = h} du (1)m1 = xki

(40)
we conclude again that the minimal models contains the h representations
with multiplicity 1, while the su(m)1contains dimsu (m)() of them.

to complete our analysis, we consider the hamiltonian of the c = m
w1+ minimal models, which is completely analogous to the c = 2 case.
the projection from the abelian theory to the minimal models is obtained
by the application of the constraint on the states given by

with i = 1, ..., m  1 and the ei
the ladder operators of the su(m) lie

algebra. the analogous to ei
in the su(2) case is j0 , which select one
state of the multiplet -the lowest weight state. the relevant term we have to
add to the hamiltonian to accomplish the projection has the form:

0

h =

(e i

because this is the unique term which annihilates the su(m) lowest-weight

state and is diagonal in the dsu(m)1 basis. as before, the infra-red limit
   corresponds to the minimal models, because other states in the hyper
multiplets acquire an energy proportional to . the hamiltonian description,
gives us a physical framework in which it is possible to discuss the dierences
between the two types of theories. the renormalization group action shows
a natural link between the theories relating the limits   0 and   ,
corresponding to the abelian theory and the minimal models respectively.
