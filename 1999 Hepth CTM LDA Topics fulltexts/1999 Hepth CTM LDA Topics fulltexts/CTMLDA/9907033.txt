(but believe background completely arbitrary backgorund elds would satisfy proper on-shell constraints supergravity order action -symmetric.) recently, attempt constructing type iib matrix model ads5 5 , utilized killing spinor gauge developed  gauge-xing condition -symmetry. (see also related works .) aim present article apply method developed case background geometry. indeed, following method obtain matrix model found ishibashi et al {$9612115$}. one advantage construction make use analytic continuation spinor variable path integral used ishibashi et al. instead, use killing spinor gauge world-sheet duality symmetry type iib superstring theory. another advantage course construction extensible construction complicated matrix models . first all, let us start type iib green-schwarz superstring action background nambu-goto form {$9703078$}: = s1 + s2 = z d2(l1 + l2), l1 = l2 = iijix a(1aj1 2aj2) + ij 1ai1 2aj2 2, 1 2 = iijkij iajj (ix ikaik), 1 2 (1) (2) 2 = abab, jij, ab = = ix iiaii , b 1 k = 3 = 1 0 0 1! . (3) majorana-weyl spinors ten dimensions various indices take following values: i, j, ... = 0, 1; a, b, ... = 0, 1, ..., 9; i, j, ... = 1, 2. straightforward check action n = 2 supersymmetry {$9612115$} si = , sx = iiai , = i, x = iiai, local -symmetry 1 = (1 + )1, 2 = (1 )2, = 2q 1 2 = +1. 1 22 abab, (4) (5) (6) let us x -symmetry killing spinor gauge . minkowskian space-time poincare group iso(1, 9) isometry group, natural consider following killing spinor gauge condition case hand j = 0, p ij dened projection operator p ij p ij = 1 2 (ij i11ij), (7) (8) chiral matrix 11 = 01...9. (the simple choice projection operator 2(ij iij). easy see choice leads result shown p ij paper.) note projection operator satises following identities: = 1 p 2 = p, p+p = pp+ = 0, pa = ap. result, show iaii = 2iai, kij iaij = 0. 2 (9) (10) dened 1 + = . latter equation eq.(10), together eq.(2), leads fact wess-zumino term l2 vanishes present gauge condition. thus, arrive -symmetry gauge-xed action given = z d2s 1 2 2, 2 = abab, ab = jij, = ix 2iai. b (11) (12) -symmetry gauge-xed action (11) still quartic respect fermionic variable, possible reduce much simpler quadratic form making world-sheet duality transformation follows {$9612115$}. aim, let us rst rewrite action (11) polyakov form = 1 2 z d2ggij(ix 2iai)(jx 2iaj). (13) next, rewrite action (13) rst-order form introducing lagrange multi- plier p = 1 2 z d2ggijhp p j + 2p (jx 2iaj)i . (14) actually integration p solving resulting equation terms dual variable x gives rise action (13). integrating x p ia = 1 g ijj x a, obtain desired dual action = 1 2 z d2(ggiji x aj x + 4iiji x aj). (15) (16) quite remarkable -symmetry gauge-xed action (11) transformed much simpler quadratic form world-sheet duality transformation. action still invariant residual n = 2 supersymmetry. supersym- metry found amalgamating original supersymmetry (4) -symmetry (5) preserve gauge xing condition (7), words, 1 = i112. following sim- ilar procedure reference {$9612115$}, let us consider mixed transformation n = 2 supersymmetry (4) -symmetry (5) = si + , x = sx + x a. 3 (17) provided dene 2 = i112 2 = i112 choose 1 = 1 + 2 2 1 2 2 = , 2 , (18) gauge xing condition preserved desired. conditions denition = = 1 + 2 2 1 2 2 , , easy derive new n = 2 supersymmetry law whose result given = , (19) (20) whereas necessary make work transformation law x a. similar way case , nd new n = 2 supersymmetry transformation law original variable x gives us transformation p x = 2ia( + ), p = 4ii . (21) (22) expression, derive new n = 2 supersymmetry law x (23) note derive equation used fact gij replaced ijg since expressions make contribution action s. stage, p important notice expressed terms dual variable x = 4ia. = 1 2g x aj x bijab. finally, integrating gij, nish dual action = z d2(s 1 2 2 + 2iijix aj). n = 2 supersymmetry action given 1 = x = 4ia. 2q 1 2 2 abab + , 4 (24) (25) (26) equations, written x simply x dened ab ab = ix ajx bij. (27) expressions equivalent {$9612115$}, obtain type iib matrix model following path thought {$9612115$}. notice even derived matrix model starting type iib superstring action (1), (2) derivation method dierent. particular, approach rely analytic continuation spinor variable path integral plays important role {$9612115$} seems extensible general situation . course, key idea behind approach hand symmetry green-schwarz superstring action {$9703078$} world-sheet duality transformation. incidentally, recently examined duality transformations green-schwarz superstring well supersymmetric d-brane actions general type ii supergravity background {$9306122$}.
