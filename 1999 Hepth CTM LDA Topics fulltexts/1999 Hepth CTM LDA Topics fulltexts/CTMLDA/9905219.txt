obvious boundary theory (yang-mills theory nite temeprature) unusual conserved quantity. fact quite possible conserved quantity. ads/cft corresondence would predict angular momentum bulk particle conserved. outrageous predic- tion. presumably happening bulk particle interacting hawking particles emitted black holes, thereby loosing angular momentum. situation particle fall black hole eventually regardless initial angular momentum. super- gravity theory used bulk know eect, boundary 5 theory somehow knows predicting eect. one would expect supergravity equations corrected include self inter- action dilatons, equivalently back reaction hawking photons, eect would seen. regardless whether one neglects drag eect heat bath not, one thing clear above. wavepacket large value boundary momentum pi take longer thermalize. turns seen numerical simulations yang-mills - lyapunov exponents found decrease pi. thus supergravity connection provides intuitive understanding fact. ideas described correct one able calculate lyapunov exponent yang-mills using supergravity connection. one compare obtained using nite temperature methods qcd. one course keep mind latter computed perturbative regime whereas supergravity calculation necessarily describes strong coupling region. inverse gluon two point function nite temperature form (ignoring index structure): 1() = 2 k2 (), () contains nite temperature corrections tree level result. calculated imaginary time formalism takes values 2int . analytically continue real axis locate poles 0 + i0. clearly 0 im(0) . 0 fact damping coecient. supergravity side rather calculate propagator, determine 0 +i0 directly solving dilaton equation. 1 20 computation proceeds {$9803131$} except two dierences: one assume real time dependence solve energy eigenvalue terms momentum. second boundary condition dierent lead complex eigenvalue. able evaluate eigenvalue analytically argue complex also determine overall scale. numerical evaluation reported elsewhere. 1the real-time method reproduce correctly imaginary part two point function . nevertheless location pole correct. implies imaginary part self energy function determines lyapunov exponent also correct. 6 finally would like make comments issue classical lyapunov exponent signicance quantum yang-mills. calculated damping coecient hot (quantum) gluon plasma - classical calculation supergravity, fully quantum me- chanical yang-mills. turns perturbation theory leading term independent h (see eqn (1.1)) classical result . also turns out, mentioned earlier, leading term equal lyapunov exponent classical yang-mills. thus conclude classical yang-mills chaotic. go quantum theory, presumably must retain h corrections gluon plasma damping coecient. direct relevance quantity quantum chaos known. mentioned earlier, generally believed systems classically chaotic also quantum mechanically chaotic. true quantum yang-mills (with sucicient energy density) also look thermal. property classically chaotic systems invoking make statements quantum theory. summarize, calculated damping coecient hot (quantum mechanical) gluon plasma. physically interesting quantity itself. moreover, classical limit gives lyapunov exponent classical yang-mills which, thus chaotic. qualitatively expect quantum yang-mills also chaotic hence look thermal. role h corrections (that eect computed) quan- tum chaos quantum yang-mills open question. one reasonably conjecture one exact eective action hot (large n) qcd (i.e. functional integral) lyapunov exponent would fully quantum mechanical damping coecient computed. 2 preliminaries metric describing ads5 - schwarzschild black hole space-time ds2 = ( r2 b2 + 1 gm r2 )dt2 + dr2 ( r2 b2 + 1 gm r2 ) + r2d2. = v (r)dt2 + dr2 v (r) + r2d2.
