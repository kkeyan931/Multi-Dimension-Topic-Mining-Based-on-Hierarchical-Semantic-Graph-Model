abstract

we present an identity relating the partition function of n = 4 supersym-
metric qed to that of its dual under mirror symmetry. the identity is a gen-
eralized fourier transform. many known properties of abelian theories can be
derived from this formula, including the mirror transforms for more general
gauge and matter content. we show that n = 3 chern-simons qed and
n = 4 qed with bf-type couplings are conformal eld theories with exactly
marginal couplings. mirror symmetry acts on these theories as strong-weak
coupling duality. after identifying the mirror of the gauge coupling (some-
times called the magnetic coupling) we construct a theory which is exactly
mirror  at all scales  to n = 4 sqed. we also study vortex-creation
operators in the large nf limit.

i. introduction

major advances in supersymmetric eld theory and string theory in various dimensions
have led to the understanding that it is common for apparently dierent quantum eld
theories to be quantum-mechanically equivalent. two theories which are dual in this
way may be thought of as two choices of variables in a path integral representation for the
same generating functional. not that such duality relations are new; the relation between
position space and momentum space representations of quantum mechanical systems are
of this type; the order-disorder-fermion representations of the ising model, the identity of
the sine-gordon model and the thirring model, and target-space duality in two-dimensional
sigma-models are well known from two dimensions; and it has long been conjectured that
n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory in four dimensions is a conformal eld theory with
a duality symmetry. the developments in the last few years have provided vast amounts of
circumstantial evidence for the latter conjecture and have shown that many dierent duality
transformations exist in higher dimensions with as few as four supercharges (which is n = 1
supersymmetry in four dimensions and n = 2 supersymmetry in three.)
however, outside of a small number of examples  free eld theories, some lattice models,
and a few two-dimensional continuum eld theories  we do not know the precise change of
variables which would allow the transformation from one representation of a theory to a dual
representation. in this paper we take a small step toward making the mirror symmetry [1]
of three dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric abelian gauge theories explicit. first, focusing
on the infrared behavior of these theories, where mirror symmetry is exact, we present a
formula which captures the essence of the mirror symmetry transformation in the form of a
generalized fourier transform. this formula encodes most known results in abelian mirror
symmetry in simple ways. second, we use the formula to derive some new results. we
consider n = 3 chern-simons theories [2,3] and n = 4 theories with bf-type couplings
[4] interacting with matter, and argue they ow in the infrared to lines of xed points
parameterized by the coecient of the cs or bf term. as we will show, mirror symmetry
maps these models to models of the same type while inverting the cs or bf coupling; the
inversion of the cs coupling agrees with [5]. third, after identifying the eld theory origin
of the mirror of the gauge coupling (the so-called magnetic coupling), we use our formula
to suggest a mirror for n = 4 sqed which is valid at all energy scales, not just in the
infrared. finally, we discuss the construction of the vortex-creation operators in n = 4
sqed, and compute their dimension at large nf .

ii. preliminaries

we work in minkowski space with signature ( + +). the n = 4 superalgebra has
eight supercharges which are doublets under sl(2, r)  su(2)r  su(2)n ; the rst factor
is the lorenz group, while the last two are r-symmetries. we use indices , ; i, j; a, b for
the indices of the dening representation of these three factors. the abelian gauge theories
which are the subject of this paper describe the interaction of u(1) vector multiplets v and
charged hypermultiplets q.
in components the vector multiplet contains a gauge boson
a, a gaugino i
a and three real scalars {ij}, while the hypermultiplet contains a doublet
of complex scalars qa and a doublet of spinors i. because n = 4 superspace is often

2

inconvenient, we will use n = 2 superspace language. the hypermultiplet can be written
as two n = 2 chiral superelds q, q of charge 1,1. the n = 4 vector multiplet consists
of an n = 2 real vector multiplet v whose lowest component is a real scalar and a chiral
multiplet  whose lowest component is a complex scalar. in the n = 2 notation only the
u(1)n  su(2)n r-symmetry is explicit; the supereld  has u(1)n charge 2, while the
rest of the n = 2 superelds are uncharged.
the n = 4 supersymmetry algebra has an idempotent outer automorphism which in-
terchanges su(2)r and su(2)n . this automorphism takes an ordinary vector multiplet,
whose scalars transform as a triplet of su(2)n , into a twisted vector multiplet [4], whose
scalars transform as a triplet of su(2)r. similarly, one can dene a twisted hypermultiplet
whose bosonic elds form an su(2)n doublet. field and supereld constituents of twisted
n = 4 multiplets will be distinguished with a hat, e.g.  for the chiral part of the twisted
vector multiplet. note that  has u(1)n charge 0, while q and q, the chiral constituents
of the twisted hypermultiplet, have u(1)n charge 1.

in three dimensions a photon is the electric-magnetic dual of a scalar. the scalar is
periodic if the gauge group is compact, and shifting it by a constant is a symmetry of the
classical theory. this duality transformation takes a free n = 4 vector multiplet into a
twisted hypermultiplet with target space r3  s1 or r4, depending on whether the gauge
group is compact or not. similarly, a free twisted vector multiplet is the electric-magnetic
dual of an ordinary hypermultiplet.

yet another type of n = 4 multiplet is a linear multiplet (which also has a twisted
version). linear multiplets are important because they contain conserved currents. an
n = 4 linear multiplet consists of an n = 2 linear multiplet  (a real supereld satisfying
d2 = d2 = 0) and an n = 2 chiral supereld  with u(1)n charge 2. the eld strength
of a vector multiplet f resides in a linear multiplet with  = id dv and  = . the
conserved current in this case is f where  is the hodge star; the conservation of f is
a consequence of the bianchi identity df = 0. the charge associated to this current is
the generator of the shift symmetry of the dual photon mentioned above. the noether
current associated with the avor symmetries of a twisted hypermultiplet also resides in an
,  = q q. conversely, the topological
n = 4 linear multiplet; in this case  = q q  q q
current  f associated with a twisted vector multiplet and the avor current of an ordinary
hypermultiplet reside in a twisted linear multiplet. the latter consists of an n = 2 linear
multiplet  and a chiral multiplet  with u(1)n charge 0.
the action of an n = 4 theory of hypermultiplets and abelian vector multiplets contains
sh(q,v) = z d3x d4 (cid:16)qe2v q + qe2v q(cid:17) (cid:20)z d3x d2 i2q q + c.c.(cid:21) ,

(4)

here mr  r and m  c together form an su(2)n triplet while r  r and   c form an
su(2)r triplet. these building blocks suce to construct the most general renormalizable
action containing only ordinary hypermultiplets and vector multiplets. the most general
renormalizable action for twisted elds is obtained by putting hats over all elds in (1)(4).
if the mass terms and the fi terms are zero, the n = 4 action has su(2)r  su(2)n r-
symmetry, as well as two discrete symmetries which we call p and cp. to dene these discrete
symmetries we need to recall how parity transformation acts on majorana spinors in three
dimensions. let us dene parity as a reection of one of the spatial coordinates, say x1 
x1 = x1. to ensure parity-invariance of the dirac equation we must transform spinors
according to   r, where the two-by-two matrix r satises rt r = 1, rt 01r =
01, rt 02r = 02. then parity acts on n = 2 superspace via x0 = x0, x1 =
x1, x2 = x2,  = r. the chiral superspace measure d2 is parity-odd, while d4 is
parity-even. we dene p as a transformation which acts on n = 2 superelds via

v (x, ) = v (x, ), (x, ) = (x, ),
q(x, ) = q(x, ).
q(x, ) = q(x, ),

the transformation cp is dened by

v (x, ) = v (x, ), (x, ) = (x, ),
q(x, ) = q(x, ),
q(x, ) = q(x, ).

(5)

(6)

we call these transformations p and cp because the gauge eld behaves as a polar vector
with respect to p and as an axial vector with respect to cp. it easy to check that when
masses and fi terms are absent, the action is both p and cp-invariant. mass terms break
p, while fi terms break cp. to dene p and cp for twisted multiplets we simply put hats
over all elds in eqs. (5) and (6).

let us recall how mirror symmetry works for n = 4 abelian gauge theories without
twisted elds [1]. if we set the hypermultiplet masses and fi couplings to zero, then the only
mass scale in these theories is g2, and they are believed to ow to nontrivial superconformal
xed points in the infrared, where the scale g2 is washed out. each of these superconformal
xed points has a dual description using the duality mapping known as mirror symmetry [1].
under mirror symmetry, electrically charged particles and abrikosov vortex solitons are
exchanged. the mirror theory is a twisted abelian gauge theory, i.e.
the fundamental
degrees of freedom live in twisted hypermultiplets and twisted vector multiplets. the higgs
branch of one theory is the coulomb branch of its mirror; similarly, the mass terms for the
hypermultiplets are mirror to the fi terms for the twisted vector multiplets (which determine
the masses of vortices.) the mapping of avor symmetries is generally complicated. the
u(1) currents from abelian subgroups of hypermultiplet avor symmetries are mapped to

4

the u(1) currents  f [1]. the o-diagonal currents of the avor symmetries are not seen
semiclassically and will not be discussed below.

for example, the mirror of n = 4 u(1) with nf avors [we will refer to this theory as
sqed-nf ] is a twisted u(1)nf 1 gauge theory with nf twisted hypermultiplets qp, qp, p =
1, . . . , nf , where qp has charge +1 under the pth u(1) factor and charge 1 under the
(p  1)th u(1) factor [1]. the topological current f of n = 4 sqed is mirror to the
noether current which generates a u(1) global symmetry transformation qp  ei qp, qp 
ei qp, p = 1, . . . , nf . it is convenient to choose the normalization in which q has charge
1/nf under this global u(1); then all gauge invariant operators in the u(1)nf 1 theory have
integer global u(1) charges. note that the case nf = 2 is special, since the mirror theory is
isomorphic to the original one [1].

it is also interesting to consider theories which contain both ordinary and twisted n = 4
multiplets. a natural way to couple twisted and ordinary vector multiplets is by means of
an n = 4 bf term [4]. it appears that this is the only way to couple twisted and ordinary
elds without introducing operators of dimension higher than three. the n = 4 bf term
has the following form:

sbf ( v,v) =

1

2 z d3x d4 v  (cid:20) 1

2 z d3x d2 i  + c.c.(cid:21)

its component form in the wess-zumino gauge is given by

sbf =

1
2

mnpam fnp + {ij} d{ij} + {ab}d{ab} + ii
a

i (cid:19) .
a

(7)

(8)

here d{ab} and d{ij} are the auxiliary elds of the ordinary and twisted vector multiplets
respectively. the authors of [4], who were the rst to construct the n = 4 bf coupling,
observed that both ordinary and twisted multiplets were required. noting the analogy with
two dimensions, they correctly conjectured the existence of a mirror symmetry which would
exchange these multiplets. we will see in section iii that the bf interaction lies at the
heart of the mirror transform.

the bf term gives a gauge-invariant mass to both v and v. it also breaks p and cp.
certain discrete symmetries remain unbroken, however. namely, a transformation which
acts as p (cp) on the ordinary elds and as cp (p) on the twisted elds is still a symmetry.
when a bf term is present in the action, one can dualize either a twisted vector multiplet,
or an ordinary one, but not both of them simultaneously. also, in the presence of the bf
term the shift symmetry of the dual photon is gauged. this will be discussed in more detail
in section iv.

we will also need gauge-xing terms. their explicit form is unimportant for our purposes.

for example, one can use an n = 2covariant version of landau gauge:

sgf (v) = z d3x(cid:18)z d2  d2v + c.c.(cid:19) ,

(9)

where  is a chiral supereld serving as a lagrange multiplier. this particular gauge-xing
term breaks n = 4 supersymmetry down to n = 2 but the correlators of gauge-invariant
quantities remain n = 4supersymmetric.

5

as in [1], one can prove nonrenormalization theorems for various branches of the moduli
space. in particular, the metric on the higgs branch, where ordinary hypermultiplets have
vevs, does not depend on the gauge coupling of the ordinary vector multiplets. similarly,
the metric on the twisted higgs branch, where twisted hypermultiplets have vevs, is unaf-
fected by the twisted gauge coupling. on the other hand, in the presence of the bf term
the metric on the higgs branch does depend on the twisted gauge coupling. we will see this
explicitly in section iv.

iii. the mirror transform is a fourier transform

it has been known for some time that most known results of abelian mirror symmetry can
be derived from the properties of n = 4 supersymmetric u(1) gauge theory with a single
charged hypermultiplet (an electron, a positron and their scalar partners.) this theory,
which we will call sqed-1, ows from weak coupling in the ultraviolet to strong coupling
in the infrared, where it becomes a conformal eld theory (cft) which we will refer to
as cft-1. the fundamental result of mirror symmetry is that cft-1 is equivalent to a
gaussian theory [6]  namely, a free twisted hypermultiplet.

sqed-1 has a single abelian global symmetry whose current is f . the associated
charge, the integrated magnetic ux, is the vortex number. we may couple this current and
its superpartners to a background twisted vector multiplet v through a bf-type interaction
(7). then the generating functional for correlation functions of the current multiplet in
sqed-1 can be written as

zsqed1[ v] = z dv dq exp  i

g2 sv (v) + isgf (v) + isbf ( v,v) + ish (q,v)! .

(10)

we dene this functional integral as the sum of its expansion in powers of g2. since the
theory is abelian, there are no instanton corrections. power counting and symmetries imply
that there are no divergences in this expansion, so no counterterms are needed in (10).
since g is the only available scale, the perturbative expansion is actually an expansion in
powers of g2/p where p is momentum. to obtain the infrared cft, one needs to resum
the perturbative series and take the limit g  . applying this limit formally to (10) we
obtain the expression

zcft1[ v] = z dv dq eisgf (v)+isbf ( v,v)+ish (q,v) .

(11)

as mentioned above, cft-1 is equivalent to a theory of a free twisted hypermultiplet q,
with the eld strength of v being mapped to the abelian u(1) avor current of the twisted
hypermultiplet. the appropriate path integral is

z q[ v] = z d q eish ( q, v) .

(12)

the statement of mirror symmetry is z q[ v] = zcft1[ v]. the integrals over the hypermul-
tiplets are quadratic and give a superdeterminant of the supersymmetric laplacian k on at
d = 3 n = 4 superspace. using this, we may write the equivalence of these two generating
functionals in the following suggestive form:

6

sdet(cid:16)k[ v](cid:17) = z dv eisgf (v)eisbf ( v,v) sdet (k[v]) .

(13)

mirror symmetry between n = 4 sqed-1 and the theory of a free twisted hypermultiplet is
thus related to the invariance of the superdeterminant under a fourier transform with respect
to the background elds. note that this is highly non-trivial, as neither superdeterminant
is gaussian.

the relation (13) encapsulates many known properties of mirror symmetry and allows

them to be rederived using elementary manipulations. we list a few examples here.

a. inverse and repeated fourier transforms

to invert the functional fourier transform (fft) we multiply both sides of (13) by
exp[isbf (v , v)isgf ( v)], where v  is another background vector multiplet, and integrate
both sides of (13) over v. the physical meaning of these manipulations is that gauging a
global symmetry in one theory corresponds to removing a gauge symmetry (sometimes called
ungauging) using a bf coupling in its mirror. if instead we apply the fft to sdet(k[v])
twice, we get sdet(k[v]), implying that the fourth power of the fft is the identity
transformation. (this is also true for the ordinary fourier transform on the space of c 
functions of rapid decrease.) in the string-theoretic approach of [7] to mirror symmetry, the
mirror transform is eected by a generator s of sl(2, z) which also satises s4 = 1.

b. mapping of operators

as discussed in sec. 2, mirror symmetry maps hypermultiplet masses to fayet-iliopoulos
terms, hypermultiplet avor currents to topological currents, and the higgs branch of moduli
space to the coulomb branch. these mappings can be easily seen in eq. (13). a free

 qi, while cft-1
hypermultiplet has a higgs branch parameterized by h q qi and h q q  q
has a coulomb branch with coordinates hi, hi. that these branches are exchanged is
made clear by taking derivatives of the two sides of (13) with respect to , v . similarly,
a constant expectation value for  gives a mass to the hypermultiplet q while inducing a
fayet-iliopoulos coupling for v. the background gauge eld a couples to the topological
current of cft1 and to the avor current of the free hypermultiplet.

c. the convolution theorem

the inverse fft and the convolution theorem may be applied to derive mirror symmetry
in all other abelian n = 4 theories. for example, to study (twisted) sqed-nf , with
(twisted) hypermultiplets qi of charge 1, one raises both sides of eq. (13) to the power
nf and then integrates over v. on the left-hand side one gets the partition function of
the twisted sqed-nf . on the right-hand side, the integration over v removes the vector
multiplet which couples equally to all nf hypermultiplets. the remaining nf 1 vectors and
nf hypermultiplets form the u(1)nf 1 theory described in sec. ii. similar manipulations
allow one to nd the mirror of an arbitrary abelian n = 4 theory. the results agree with
[8].

7

d. n = 2 mirror symmetry

n = 2 sqed with two oppositely charged chiral superelds q, q can be obtained from
n = 4 sqed-1 by coupling the latter to a neutral chiral supereld s via the interaction
r d2 s, which makes both s and  massive [9,10]. we may identify the chiral eld 
in the twisted vector multiplet v with s and integrate over  on both sides of (13) with
weight exp(i/hr d4  ). in our normalization  has engineering dimension 1, therefore
h is a parameter of dimension 1. the right-hand side becomes the partition function of a
theory whose infrared (large h) limit is the same as the infrared limit of n = 2 sqed-1.
the left-hand side is a partition function of an n = 2 theory of three chiral superelds
q, q,  coupled via the superpotential w =  q q. these two theories were shown to be
mirror in [9,10]. mirror symmetry in all other n = 2 abelian theories can again be derived
using the convolution theorem and the inverse fourier transform. in all these theories there
are no ultraviolet divergences (if regularization preserves all the symmetries), so our formal
manipulations are presumably justied.

iv. n = 4 theories with bf couplings

in this section we study n = 4 theories which contain both ordinary and twisted elds
coupled via a bf term eq. (7). these theories apparently have not been considered in the
literature. we will show that bf couplings are exactly marginal. they parameterize man-
ifolds of conformal eld theories, in analogy to maxwell couplings in nite d = 4 n = 2
supersymmetric gauge theories. as in the four-dimensional case, weakly coupled theories
are found near certain boundary points of these manifolds, with the inverse bf couplings
serving as expansion parameters for a nite perturbation series around a free theory. mir-
ror symmetry acts on these manifolds by exchanging strongly coupled scfts with weakly
coupled ones.

to be concrete, let us consider a copy of n = 4 sqed-1 and a copy of its twisted version,

coupled via a bf-term with coecient k. the classical action of this theory is

1
g2 sv (v) +

1
g2 sv ( v) + sh(q,v) + sh( q, v) + ksbf (v, v) .

the vector multiplets become topologically massive and therefore both the twisted and
ordinary coulomb branches are lifted. the classical moduli space of this theory consists
of a higgs branch and a twisted higgs branch parameterized by the ordinary and twisted
hypermultiplet vacuum expectation values, respectively. these branches intersect at a single
point (the origin.) to determine the metric we must solve the d-atness conditions modulo
gauge transformations. the d-atness conditions for the higgs branch are

qpq =

k
2

p , p = 1, 2, 3.

(14)

note that the lowest component of the twisted vector multiplet plays the role of the dynam-
ical fayet-iliopoulos term. we expect that eqs. (14) can be interpreted as moment map
equations for a hyperkahler quotient [11] (see also [12] for a review).

8

to see that this is indeed the case, recall that we can dualize the twisted photon a into

a scalar  .  can be combined with p into a quaternion

w =

g2
2

+ ip p ,

where g is the twisted gauge coupling. in terms of w the kinetic energy of the twisted vector
multiplet takes the form

1
2g2|w|2 .

the metric |dw|2/(2g2) is, up to an overall factor, the standard hyperkahler metric on r4
(or r3  s1 if we take the gauge group to be compact.) we can also think of the complex
doublet q as a quaternion, with metric |dq|2. under a constant gauge transformation
from the untwisted u(1), q transforms as q  qei1. less trivially, w transforms as
w  w  kg2/(2), as explained below. the hyperkahler moment equations for this
transformation are precisely (14). it is well known that this hyperkahler quotient yields the
taub-nut metric [12], and thus the higgs branch is the taub-nut space. this space can be
thought of as a circle bered over r3. the taub-nut metric depends on a single parameter
which sets the asymptotic radius of this circle. in the present case this radius is kg. identical
arguments show that the twisted higgs branch is also a taub-nut space, the asymptotic
radius being kg. note that these results are in agreement with the nonrenormalization
theorem stated in section ii, which says that the metric on the higgs branch (resp. twisted
higgs branch) does not depend on the gauge coupling (resp. twisted gauge coupling).

let us recall why the dual photon  transforms additively,     k, under a constant
gauge transformation. in short, the bf coupling a  f can be interpreted as a coupling of
the gauge eld a to a topological current  f generating the shift of the dual photon. this
means that the shift symmetry is gauged, a being the corresponding gauge eld, so a gauge
transformation of a must be accompanied by a shift of  . a more detailed argument goes as
follows. in order to dualize the twisted gauge eld a we need to treat its eld strength f as
an unconstrained 2-form and impose the bianchi identity d f = 0 via a lagrange multiplier
 . then the action takes the form

1
4



mnp fmn(kap + p  ) + . . . ,

where dots denote terms which are manifestly invariant with respect to gauge transforma-
tions a  a + d. the action will be invariant if we also transform  as     k.
our discussion of the metric was classical, but one can show that there are no quantum-
mechanical corrections. indeed, supersymmetry tells us that the metric is hyperkahler, and
we also know that it has su(2)r isometry (su(2)n for the twisted higgs branch) which
rotates the three complex structures. this, together with the known asymptotic behavior,
uniquely determines the metric [13].

in the infrared limit we must take both gauge couplings to innity, and then the moduli
space becomes a pair of r4s intersecting at the origin. for innite gauge couplings the
one-particle poles in the propagators of the vector multiplets move to innity; nevertheless
the vector multiplets cannot be ignored, since the bf term remains and induces a nontrivial
interaction between the ordinary and twisted hypermultiplets, whose strength depends on

9

k. the theory at the origin of the moduli space is a nontrivial cft (as the moduli space is
not smooth there) with n = 4 susy and unbroken su(2)r  su(2)n symmetry.
for k   the vector multiplets decouple, so the cft at the origin becomes a direct
sum of a free hypermultiplet and a free twisted hypermultiplet. it is straightforward to set
up perturbation theory in 1/k. using the approach of refs. [14,15] it is easy to show that
the coecient of the bf-term k is not renormalized, so the cft at the origin is an exactly
marginal deformation of the theory with k = , i.e. of a free theory.
in fact, the high
degree of supersymmetry ensures that there are no ultraviolet divergences in this expansion.
the dimension of any operator can be computed as a power series in 1/k. the dimensions
of operators in short representations of the superconformal algebra are determined by their
su(2)r  su(2)n quantum numbers:  = jr + jn for scalar primary operators, where
jr and jn are the su(2)r and su(2)n spins [16]. the dimensions of operators in long
superconformal multiplets depend on k, in general.

in the opposite limit, k  0, ordinary and twisted multiplets do not couple to each other
and the theory ows to a direct sum of cft-1 and twisted cft-1. note that this theory is
mirror to the theory at k  . one may conjecture that more generally the cft at large
k and the cft at small k are mirror to each other. to show that this is indeed the case,
consider the following generating functional for the cft with bf coupling k:

zk[u, u] = z dv d v sdet(cid:16)k[ v](cid:17) sdet (k[v]) exp(cid:16)iksbf ( v,v) + isgf (v) + isgf ( v)+

isbf ( v,u) + isbf ( u,v)(cid:17) .

(15)

(16)

dierentiating zk with respect to u and u generates all the correlations functions of ordinary
and twisted vector multiplets. now we substitute the right-hand side of (13) for sdet (k[v])
and sdet(cid:16)k[ v](cid:17) and perform gaussian integrals over v and v. the result turns out to be

z1/k(cid:20)

1
ku,

1
k

u(cid:21) exp(cid:18)

i
k

sbf ( u ,u)(cid:19) .

this means that the connected correlation functions of v and v in cfts with bf couplings
k and 1/k are related by a trivial rescaling. the two-point functions in addition dier by
a contact term.
our discussion can be easily generalized to theories with nf > 1 and larger gauge groups.
for example, take nf copies of cft-1, each with a hypermultiplet of charge 1. take a
similar set of copies of twisted cft-1, and couple the vector multiplets to the twisted
vector multiplets via a bf term, giving the action

sh(qi,vi) + sh( qi, vi) +xi,j

kijsbf (vi, vj) .

this yields a manifold of n = 4 scfts parameterized by the matrix k. mirror symmetry
acts on this manifold by k  k1. when k is nondegenerate, the coulomb branches are
lifted. the metrics of the higgs and twisted higgs branches can be computed as in the
nf = 1 case above and, for nite maxwell couplings, turn out to be of the lee-weinberg-yi
type [12].

in summary, n = 4 theories with bf couplings are similar in many respects to certain

v. n = 3 theories with chern-simons couplings

it is believed impossible to write down an n = 4 supersymmetric chern-simons (cs)
action coupled to matter. however, an n = 3 cs action exists [2,3]. one simply identies
the ordinary and twisted vector multiplets appearing in the bf action (7). this identication
obviously breaks su(2)r  su(2)n symmetry down to its diagonal subgroup su(2)d and,
less obviously, breaks n = 4 susy down to n = 3. under su(2)d the four supercharges of
n = 4 decompose as 1 + 3. the identication breaks the singlet while the triplet survives.
we will see the properties of these theories are very similar to those considered in the
previous section.

let us briey review n = 3 susy theories. the basic multiplets are the hypermultiplet
and the vector multiplet. the hypermultiplet contains an su(2)d-doublet of scalars qa
and an su(2)d-doublet of spinors a. the vector multiplet contains a triplet of real scalars
{ab}, a triplet of spinors {ab}, a singlet spinor 0, and a gauge boson a. an n = 3 action
for hypermultiplets automatically has n = 4 susy. in particular an n = 3 sigma-model
must have a hyperkahler target space. if restrict ourselves to renormalizable theories, then
the most general n = 3 action for hypermultiplets interacting with abelian vector multiplets
is the sum of the n = 4 action and the n = 3 chern-simons term for the vector multiplets

(17)

here kij is a real symmetric matrix.1 in what follows the parameters kij will be referred to
as chern-simons couplings, while the coecients of the maxwell terms will be called gauge
couplings, as before. note that the n = 4 theories with bf couplings considered above
form a subset of the set of n = 3 cs theories.
n = 3 gauge theories have in general both coulomb and higgs branches. when kij
is nondegenerate, all vector multiplets become massive and the coulomb branch is lifted,
while the higgs branch remains (if the number of hypermultiplets exceeds the number of
vector multiplets.) quantum corrections cannot lift this branch but, unlike the n = 4 case,
they can modify its metric. the form of the quantum corrections to the metric is tightly
constrained by the requirement that the metric be hyperkahler.

consider rst n = 3 sqed-1 with a cs coupling k and innite bare gauge coupling. in
this case there is no moduli space: the coulomb branch is lifted because the cs term gives the

1we take the gauge group to be noncompact, i.e. rn rather than u (1)n. since we take all
hypermultiplets to have unit charge, the coecients kij must be rational in the compact case;
then there is a basis where all kij and all hypermultiplet charges are integers. note that greens
functions which are well-dened in the non-compact case are identical in the compact case and are
continuous functions of k.

vector multiplet a topological mass, while the higgs branch is lifted because integrating out
the vector multiplet produces a potential for the hypermultiplet. when k   the vector
multiplet decouples, and the theory becomes a theory of a free massless hypermultiplet,
with n = 4 supersymmetry and su(2)r  su(2)n r-symmetry. since the coecient of
the cs term is not renormalized [14,15], the theory with k 6=  is an exactly marginal
deformation of the free hypermultiplet, in analogy to the bf theory considered earlier. one
can perform an ordinary feynman diagram expansion in 1/k, which by power counting and
supersymmetry is completely nite. since there are no dimensionful parameters, there is
no wave-function renormalization of the hypermultiplet. this also follows from the fact
that chiral gauge-invariant operators like q q belong to short representations of n = 3
superconformal algebra, and their dimension is determined entirely by their su(2)d spin
via  = jd. the dimensions of nonchiral operators will generally depend on k.

in the opposite limit k  0 we obtain n = 4 sqed-1 with innite gauge coupling, i.e.
cft-1, which is mirror to the free hypermultiplet found as k  . as in the bf case,
we are led to the conclusion that n = 3 sqed-1 with cs coupling k is dual to n = 3
sqed-1 with cs coupling 1/k. (the inversion of the cs coupling was previously argued,
using branes in type iib string theory, in [5].) the generating functional of cft-1 with
cs coupling k is

zk[u] = z dv sdet (k[v]) exp (ikscs(v,v) + isgf (v) + isbf (u,v)) .
upon using eq. (13) and performing the gaussian integral over v this becomes

z1/k(cid:20)

(18)

(19)

this shows that the connected correlators of v at cs coupling k and cs coupling 1/k are
related by a simple rescaling (and a shift by a contact term for the two-point function).
our discussion can be easily generalized to theories with more multiplets. consider nf
copies of cft-1 and couple the vector multiplets together as in (17). the theories at the
origin of moduli space make up a manifold of n = 3 scfts parameterized by the matrix
k. mirror symmetry acts on this manifold by k  k1. for generic k there is no moduli
space; the only solution of the classical d-atness equations

(no sum on i) is the trivial one,  = q = q = 0. in general, we may search for solutions
as follows. the second set of equations in (20) requires that we divide the indices i into two

of this the scalars v transform additively under gauge transformations of other photons.

x the expectation values of qr up to a gauge transformation. as in the bf case, these
equations can be interpreted as moment map equations for a hyperkahler quotient. when
maxwell terms are present, the corresponding hyperkahler metric is again of the lee-
weinberg-yi type [12]. an interesting issue is whether there are quantum corrections to
this metric. the hyperkahler property of the metric and the presence of triholomorphic
u(1) isometries (coming from the shift symmetries of the dual photons) ensure that the
quantum metric remains of the lee-weinberg-yi type. however, these considerations still
allow the parameters of the metric to depend on the elements of the matrix k in an arbitrarily
complicated manner. we have not resolved this issue completely.

these results contain, as special cases, our results on n = 4 theories with bf couplings
and the mirror relations considered in [5]. furthermore, the general n = 3 cs theory can
be reduced to this example by linear eld redenitions and possible addition of decoupled
(k = ) vector and/or hypermultiplets.
it is interesting to note that duality of certain chern-simons theories with respect to
the inversion of the cs coupling has been conjectured to underlie the structure of the phase
diagram of quantum hall liquids; see for example [1719].

vi. mirror symmetry away from the infrared limit

in this section we give a eld-theoretic interpretation of the so-called magnetic cou-
pling2 [1] and explain how the mirror transform can be extended away from the infrared
limit. the magnetic coupling aects the metric on the higgs branch, as will be reviewed
below, and is mirror to the gauge coupling. however, its eld theory origin has not previ-
ously been determined. as we will now show, it is a fermi-type coupling  that which is
induced between (twisted) hypermultiplets by the exchange of a massive auxiliary (twisted)
vector multiplet to which they are minimally coupled. we will refer to the theory of a sin-
gle hypermultiplet coupled to this massive auxiliary vector multiplet as super-fermi theory
(sft).

an indirect way to check that the gauge and super-fermi couplings are mirror, and that
the super-fermi coupling is indeed the constant term in the metric on the higgs branch, is
to consider sqed-2 (with elds v,q1,q2) and its mirror of the same form (with twisted
elds v, q1, q2). we will take the bare electric and magnetic couplings to be innite.

2the term magnetic coupling is an unfortunate misnomer, as the relation between this in-
teraction and the electric gauge interaction is not electric-magnetic duality. mirror symmetry
exchanges particles and vortices, which couple (in the absence of a chern-simons coupling) to
dierent photons.

13

the coulomb branch is parameterized by the su(2)n triplet ~ and the scalar  which
is the electromagnetic dual of the photon. the metric is specied in terms of a harmonic
function g(~)

ds2 = g(~)(d~2) + g1(~)(d +   d~)2 ,

(21)

where   (~) = g(~). in the presence of a mass term ~m (a triplet of su(2)n ) for q1
and a mass term  ~m for q2 the function g is given by

g =

1

|~  ~m|

+

1

|~ + ~m|

.

(22)

we may obtain sqed-1 by integrating out q2, i.e. by taking m large while keeping ~ =
~  ~m xed. in this limit we get

g 

1
|~|

+

1
2| ~m|

.

(23)

the constant term in g is the gauge coupling induced at one-loop by integrating out the
massive eld q2; the one-loop integral leads to a maxwell term 1
2m sv (v). the low-energy
theory is sqed-1 with an eective coupling g2
in the mirror theory, the same branch appears as the higgs branch, which is parameter-
ized by three elds ~n, triplets of su(2)n which are bilinear in the twisted hypermultiplets,
along with a fourth scalar whose relation to the underlying elds is more complex. the
metric on the higgs branch similarly depends on a harmonic function g of ~n and a possible
fayet-iliopoulos parameter ~ which is mirror to the mass term ~m:

ef f = 2m.

g =

.

(24)

the mirror of taking ~m = ~  ~ is to take ~ = ~n  ~n. for |~|  | ~n|  |~n|, the eld q2
condenses and gives mass to v, leaving the eld q1 behind. in the limit where  is large g
becomes

g =

(25)

what is the interpretation of the constant term in g? it must be the coupling of the
leading dimension-four operator induced in this broken gauge theory  which is obviously
the super-fermi interaction for q1 induced by the massive photon. 3

3note that string theory considerations also support this claim. a d3 brane of nite length l
which ends on two parallel ns5 (d5) branes contains as its lightest multiplets a massless n = 4
u (1) vector multiplet (hypermultiplet) and a massive hypermultiplet (vector multiplet) of mass of
order  1/l [7]. the gauge coupling of the vector multiplet in the ns5 case is also of order 1/l,
and so the gauge coupling in one theory is related to the mass of a vector multiplet in its mirror.

14

a more direct argument involves the computation of the metric in the presence of the
super-fermi interaction. to give a precise denition of this interaction, let us multiply both
sides of eq. (13) by exp(isv ( v)/g2) and integrate over v. the left hand side becomes the
partition function of twisted n = 4 sqed-1 with bare gauge coupling g, while the right-
hand side corresponds to n = 4 sqed-1 with innite bare gauge coupling coupled via a
bf term to a twisted vector multiplet v. the action of the latter theory is

s = sh (q,v) + sbf ( v,v) +

1
g2 sv ( v) .

(26)

this is what we call the super-fermi theory (sft). since the action for v is quadratic it
can be integrated over, leaving the action s = sh(q,v) + g2sv aux(v) with

sv aux(v) = 

42 z d3xz d4 (cid:26)1

   1
which in the landau gauge becomes an explicit mass term for v,
42 z d3xz d4 (cid:26)v 2   1
(cid:27) .

sv aux(v) = 



1

(cid:27) ,



(27)

(28)

thus v acts as an auxiliary eld at the classical level. after integrating it out, we nd
by direct if tedious computation that the action for q is that of a sigma-model with the
taub-nut target space. moreover, the asymptotic radius of the circle parameterized by 
agrees with that computed from the mirror sqed-1 theory. (another way of doing the same
computation, using hyperkahler quotients, was explained in section iv.) the hyperkahler
property of the metric ensures that there are no quantum corrections to this result.

so far we showed the moduli space metrics of sqed-1 with nite gauge coupling and
twisted sft agree, i.e. that the two theories are equivalent in the extreme infrared every-
where on the moduli space. we now claim that this equivalence is exact, so that n = 4
sqed-1, in its renormalization group ow from weak to strong coupling, is mirror to twisted
sft at all energy scales.

this seems to be a very strong claim, as most known eld theoretic dualities have been
established only in the infrared or for conformal eld theories. however, if one has two
well-dened exact descriptions of an ultraviolet xed point, then all perturbations of this
xed point and the resulting renormalization group ows can be described using the two
sets of variables. this is the case here. the ultraviolet xed point of which sqed-1 is a
perturbation is a free theory of a hypermultiplet and a vector multiplet which are not coupled
to one another. this cft has a mirror description as a copy of twisted cft-1 along with a
vector multiplet to which it is not coupled. consider the relevant perturbation given on one
side by coupling the vector multiplet to the avor current of the hypermultiplet, and on the
other side by coupling the vector multiplet to the global current  f of the twisted cft-1 via
a bf term. this makes the rst theory into sqed-1 with a weak gauge coupling and the
second into a theory of a twisted hypermultiplet coupled to an auxiliary vector multiplet,
which induces a large super-fermi coupling. the gauge coupling in sqed-1 grows, and in
the infrared the theory becomes cft-1. the super-fermi coupling in the mirror theory
shrinks, and in the infrared the twisted hypermultiplet becomes free. to restate the claim,
mirror symmetry implies

a corollary of this equivalence is that all correlation functions of  and  in sqed-1
must precisely agree with those of the u(1) current multiplet in the twisted sft. this can
be seen explicitly from our master equation eq. (13). to this end multiply both sides of
eq. (13) by

exp( i

g2 sv ( v) + isbf ( v,v ) + isgf ( v))

and integrate over v. after performing a gaussian integral over v on the right-hand side
and shifting the integration variables, one gets

z d v expn i

g2 sv ( v) + isgf ( v) + isbf ( v,v )o sdet(cid:16)k[ v](cid:17) =
r dv exp {ig2sv aux(v) + isgf (v)} sdet (k[v  v ]) .

(30)

here the left-hand side is the generating functional for the correlation functions of  and  in
(twisted) sqed-1, while the right-hand side is the generating functional for the correlators
of the hypermultiplets u(1) avor current in sft.

an interesting implication of this result is that the perturbative expansion of eq. (30) in
g is the superrenormalizable sqed expansion around a free theory, while the perturbation
series in 1/g is the usual nonrenormalizable sft expansion around a free theory. the former
expansion is nite, while the latter requires renormalization and fails in the ultraviolet. we
see that despite the failure of the usual perturbative expansion in sft, the theory still has
a perfectly well dened uv xed point, as in the ve and six dimensional eld theories
considered rst in [20,21].

it is also instructive to consider the current-current correlation function in sqed. for
example, consider sqed-1 with a non-zero fayet-iliopoulos term ~, which gives the hy-
permultiplet an expectation value, hq~qi = ~/(2). if ||  g2, the photon is massive
(m2
v  g2/) and stable, and shows up as a single particle state in the two-point function of
f . in addition there are much heavier semiclassical vortex states, with m2
q = 2, which can
be pair-produced by the current. note that the vortex mass is protected by a bps bound
while that of the photon is not. as we reduce ||/g2, the photon and vortex masses approach
each other. it is possible, for suciently small ||, that the photon becomes unstable and
decays into vortices, leaving no stable one-particle states in this channel. does this occur?
for small || the original variables are strongly coupled, so we must use the mirror
variables, which describe massive vortices of mass || weakly interacting via a short-distance
potential. the potential energy of a conguration of vortices is zero, but for a conguration

16

of both vortices and antivortices it is negative. it is known that two non-relativistic particles
with an attractive delta-function potential in two spatial dimensions have a single bound
state with exponentially small binding energy [22]. we therefore expect a single irreducible
supermultiplet of stable vortex-antivortex bound states. this supermultiplet is an ordinary
n = 4 vector multiplet. it therefore appears that there is a stable massive vector multiplet
in the theory for any value of ||/g2, only merging into the continuum of vortex-antivortex
states at  = 0. we believe this is a new result that could not have been derived without
the identication of the magnetic coupling.

let us nd the binding energy of this bound state. the coecient of the delta function in
the low-energy non-relativistic theory is logarithmically divergent. to obtain a sensible result
we must match it to the coecient of the fermi interaction in the relativistic sft theory.
supersymmetry ensures the relativistic fermi interaction receives only nite corrections,
which are small if ||  g2. matching requires a cuto, which should be at the scale of the
breakdown of the non-relativistic theory, that is, of order ||. putting this together with the
known result [22], we nd the binding energy is of order ||eg2/2||.
the results of this section can be easily extended to theories with more avors. we
mention one amusing example with a self-mirror renormalization group trajectory. consider
cft-2, the infrared limit of sqed-2, which is self-mirror. the theory has two global sym-
metry currents, a avor current and a topological current exchanged under mirror symmetry.
using a vector multiplet v and a twisted vector multiplet v, we may gauge both currents
with equal couplings. the resulting theory

(31)

(here gauge xing terms and couplings to background sources are omitted for brevity) ows
from cft-2 plus free vector and twisted vector multiplets in the ultraviolet to cft-2 in the
infrared. the ow can easily be seen, using eq. (13), to be self-mirror at all scales.

vii. vortex-creation operators

up to this point our discussion has been mostly concerned with the action of mirror
symmetry on conserved currents and their superpartners. but if we want to make precise the
statement that mirror symmetry exchanges particles and vortices [10], we need to understand
vortex-creation operators in sqed.

the gauge-invariant vortex-creation operators are associated with some of the most
poorly understood aspects of mirror symmetry. mirror symmetry unambiguously implies
that such operators must be present in the cfts that are found at the origin of moduli
space. however, the only hint as to how to dene them is found far along the moduli space
of the coulomb branch, where all of the charged matter is massive. there, the low-energy
theory involves only the vector multiplet, and one may safely replace each photon with its
dual scalar  . vortex creation operators are known to be proportional to ei . from mirror
symmetry we know that some of the vortex-creation operators are chiral, in the n = 2 sense,
and so, if the real scalar  in the n = 2 vector multiplet has an expectation value, a natural
form for a vortex-creation operator is e(i +/g2), where g2 is the low-energy eective gauge
coupling. however, a number of puzzles surround this choice. how are these operators to

17

be continued to the origin of moduli space, where there is a cft involving massless charged
matter which prevents naive denition of  ? what is to be done about the paradox that 
remains dimensionful in the cft but no scale g2 remains in the theory? assuming these
problems are resolved, how does the operator obtain its correct conformal dimension? how
does it acquire its abelian global charges? for n = 4 sqed, where this operator should
be part of an su(2)n multiplet, what are the other operators in the multiplet and how is
the nonabelian global symmetry realized? for those cases where there are hidden avor
symmetries [1,10] which must act on these operators, how do those symmetries appear?

we will now attempt to provide answers to some of these questions. to set the stage,
let us recall how to construct operators with nonzero vortex charge in an arbitrary abelian
gauge theory in three dimensions (formally). consider a u(1) gauge eld coupled to massless
matter. formally integrating over matter elds, we get a nonlocal eective action for the
gauge eld a. gauge invariance tells us that it can be regarded as a functional sef f (f )
of the eld strength f = da. let us change variables in the path integral from a to f ;
since f  satises the constraint df = 0, we must implement it using a lagrange multiplier
 :

z da (a)eisef f {f (a)}  z df  d exp(cid:18)isef f (f ) +

i

2 z d3x  df(cid:19) .

(32)

note f has dimension 2 (as demanded of a conserved current by the conformal algebra) so
 is dimensionless and, in analogy to a free boson in two dimensions, can be exponentiated.
it follows from (32) that  is canonically conjugate to ijfij, so that the symmetry transfor-
mation generated by the current f acts additively on  and multiplicatively on ein . our
normalization is such that ei carries a unit of this charge, the integrated magnetic ux.

since a vortex worldline carries magnetic ux, any operator which creates a vortex must
be proportional to ei [10]. to see this, consider the correlation function of two such operators

z df d exp(cid:26)isef f (f ) +

i

2 z d3x df(cid:27) ei (x)ei (y) .

(33)

the integration over  gives a factor of [df  2(x) + 2(y)]. thus, the bianchi iden-
tity is violated by two pointlike sources of magnetic ux  pointlike nondynamical dirac
monopoles, which are instantons in three dimensions. on the higgs branch, where ux is
conned into particle-like vortex solitons, these pointlike instantons will indeed be sources
for these solitons.

a susy-covariant extension of this procedure can be constructed following [23], where
it was shown how to dualize an n = 2 vector multiplet to a chiral multiplet on the coulomb
branch of the moduli space. the superspace eective action for the u(1) vector multiplet v is
regarded as a functional of  = id dv .  satises supersymmetric bianchi identities d2 =
0 = d2. if we impose this constraint explicitly by introducing a lagrange multiplier chiral

supereld t which couples to  via r d3xd4 (t + t ), then we may replace integration
over v by integration over an unconstrained real supereld . the partition function for
an n = 2 theory takes the form

z ddt exp(cid:18)isef f () +

i

4 z d3xd4 (t + t )(cid:19) .

(34)

18

the normalization in (34) is such that the imaginary part of the lowest component of t is
 , so et has vortex charge +1.

qp

consider now n = 2 or n = 4 sqed-nf . the mirror of n = 2 sqed-nf diers from
that of n = 4 sqed-nf , which was described in sec. ii, only by the presence of an extra
qp [9,10]. in both cases the mirror u(1)nf 1
neutral chiral supereld which couples to pp
gauge theory has n = 2 chiral primary operators v+ = q1 . . . qnf and v = q1 . . . qnf .
their vortex charges are +1 and 1, respectively. they live in a short representation of the
n = 2 or n = 4 superconformal algebra, and therefore their dimensions are related to their
r-charges. in n = 4 sqed-nf the dimensions are xed to be the canonical dimension,
in n = 2 sqed-nf the dimensions are not known, since the theory has a one-
nf /2.
parameter family of r-currents from which it is not clear how to select the relevant one,
but in the large nf limit the r-charges and dimensions can be determined using mirror
symmetry, as we will now explain.

as is well-known, non-supersymmetric qed is completely solvable in this limit [24].
the eective action for the photon given by integrating out nf massless electrons is simply
lef f  nf f []1/2f plus higher orders in the eld strength. as always, in the large
nf limit all scattering is suppressed and the theory becomes gaussian; since the photon
propagator is nonstandard, it is known as a generalized free eld.4 similarly, for n = 4
sqed in the large nf limit one gets

znf [ v] = z dv eisbf ( v,v)+isgf (v) [sdet (k[v])]nf

(35)

 z dv eisbf ( v,v)+isgf (v) exp(cid:26) inf

16 z d3xz d4 (cid:16)[]1/2  4[]1/2(cid:17)(cid:27)
with an analogous expression for n = 2 sqed. thus the vector multiplet is described by
a supersymmetric generalized free eld. the dimensions of matter elds q, q in sqed-nf
are canonical up to corrections of order 1/nf [24], so the mesons qpqp and their mirrors
sp [9,10] have dimension 1. it follows that the dimensions of qp and qp, which couple to
qp, are canonical, so v+ and v both have dimension
sp in the superpotential w = sp qp
nf /2.

consider now operators et and et in n = 2 or n = 4 sqed-nf , where t is the dual
photon supereld dened above. these operators are (naively) chiral and have vortex charge
+1 and 1, and the operators v+ and v should therefore be proportional to them. the
dimensions of et match those of v in the large nf limit, as we now show by computing the

4in position space the photon propagator is proportional to 1/x2. it was pointed out long ago
that this is the same as the four-dimensional photon propagator projected down onto a three-
dimensional hyperplane. we may observe that it is also the projection onto the boundary of
four-dimensional anti-de sitter space of a photon propagating on that space. to be more precise,
for a background gauge eld coupled to the three-dimensional current f , the induced propagator
in three-dimensions will also be []1/2  1/x2, as though it were a free massless vector eld
on ads4. this is not to suggest large nf (s)qed has a (super)gravity dual; the form of the
propagator is xed by conformal invariance alone.

t is dimensionless and its propagator []3/2 is logarithmic in position space, so the
operator et has a well-dened dimension. performing the gaussian integral over t in (36)
we nd that et has dimension nf /2.

in summary, we have claried several issues. the eld  can still be dened at the origin
of the moduli space without diculty, as long as one rst integrates out the massless charged
matter and re-expresses the resulting non-local action sef f using f. the complex scalar
which is exponentiated is

a non-local expression which nonetheless agrees with expectations far along the coulomb
branch. with proper normalization, the dimensions of the vortex operators et have been
shown to match those of v in the large nf limit, where sef f can be computed.

however, this is not the whole story. apart from their vortex charge, the operators v
carry non-zero and equal abelian r-charges. this is connected with the fact that in n = 4
sqed-nf there is an operator relation of the form v+v  nf . it is impossible for et and
et to satisfy these constraints. even more confusing is the fact that in n = 4 sqed-nf
the operators v+ and v 
to resolve these issues, care should be taken in the denition of the operators et . as
in two dimensions, the presence of a logarithmic propagator implies the need for an infrared
regulator, which should be supersymmetry-preserving. this regulator may carry global
symmetry charges, which might resolve some of the remaining puzzles. it is also possible
that one must account for fermionic zero-modes of the pointlike dirac monopoles that et
are intended to represent.

 actually belong to a spin-nf /2 multiplet of su(2)n .

as a last comment, we note that one of the most important unsolved problems in mirror
symmetry is the mapping of the full nonabelian avor symmetries. n = 4 sqed-nf has
an su(nf ) avor symmetry, but in the mirror description only the diagonal generators are
visible classically, with the rest emerging through quantum eects [1]. this can be seen
from the fact that operators in nontrivial representations of su(nf ) appear in the mirror
theory as a combination of operators built from fundamental elds with other operators built
from vortex-creation operators [10]. a proper denition of the vortex-creation operators is
a prerequisite for an understanding of the hidden symmetries.

viii. outlook

we have found an elegant formula, eq. (13), which summarizes many known results of
mirror symmetry. the formula states that the superdeterminant of the n = 4 supersymmet-
ric laplacian on three-dimensional minkowski space is its own generalized fourier transform.
we have used it to nd new superconformal eld theories with exactly marginal couplings,
on which mirror symmetry acts as strong-weak coupling duality. we have established mirror

20

relations between non-conformal theories which are valid at all energy scales. finally, we
have made some progress toward understanding how to dene the vortex-creation operators
which appear in these theories. however, many questions remain. we do not have the pre-
cise change of variables underlying mirror symmetry, which requires a clearer understanding
of vortex operators. we have no proof of our formula from rst principles, and see no hint
of a reformulation of the theory in which it would be manifest. lastly, we have no idea how
to generalize it to non-abelian gauge theories. we hope that future research will overcome
these obstacles to a more profound understanding of duality.
