the phenomenon of connement in non-abelian gauge theories has satisfactory explanation in a
number of models (for a review, see, e.g., [1]). according to one of them, the color electric ux of
the quark anti-quark pair is squeezed into a ux tube and this leads to a linear rise of the quark
interaction potential energy. the so called projection techniques, developed since the early papers of
t hooft and mandelstam [2], provided convenient tools, such as maximal abelian gauge, for further
studies of this mechanism on the lattice, which brought numerical evidence that color electric ux
tubes are formed due to the dual meissner eect generated by the condensation of color monopoles
[3] (see, also [4], [5] and references therein)  the phenomenon dual to the well known formation of
strings with a magnetic ux in them in the theory of superconductivity (abrikosov-nielsen-olesen
strings [6]). another explanation of connement is based on the method of maximal center gauges
[7], [8], which displayed the center dominance and lead to the center vortex picture of connement. in
this picture, the existence of z(nc) vortices, whose distribution in space time uctuates suciently
randomly, provides for the so called area decay law for the wilson loop expectation value, which
implies a linear static quark potential (for latest references see, e.g. [9] ).

there are many questions left concerning the dynamics of vortices, as well as their origin. a eld
theoretical description of them has been started as early, as in 1978 [10], and in the well known
spaghetti vacuum picture [11], which has been recently developed in the framework of the theory
of 4d surfaces and strings in a number of papers [12], [4], [13]. recently, the continuum analogue
of the maximum center gauge was constructed and discussed in [14]. at the same time, study of
simple models that allow for exact solutions may shed light on the complicated general problem of
vortex dynamics.

in the present letter, we consider the one-loop contribution of gauge eld uctuations about a
pure gauge conguration with a gauge eld vortex in a 4-dimensional space of nontrivial topology,
s1  r3, i.e., with a cylinder. this conguration resembles the simplest imitation of the aharonov-
bohm eect with a string and a non-zero magnetic ux in it. we demonstrate that our result, with
an evident reinterpretation, conrms the conclusions of the recent work of d. diakonov [15], who
investigated potential energy of vortices in the 4- and 3-dimensional gauge theories.

ii. the effective action

we consider the generating functional of the gluodynamic model for the gauge group su(2) in the
4-dimensional space time s1  r3 with a cylinder

s4 for the 4-dimensional space time s1  r3 and s2 for the 2-dimensional cylinder s1  r1, whose
presence, in the same way as a deleted point in the 2-dimensional plane, attributes a nontrivial topol-
ogy to this space conguration. the lagrangian of the gauge eld a in the external (background)
eld has the familiar form

here, f a
, t a are the su(2)-group
generators taken in the adjoint representation, aa
 is the background eld,
aa
 are quantum uctuations of the gluon eld about the background, and  and  are ghost elds.
we expand the lagrangian and keep the terms that are quadratic in gluon uctuations, which
corresponds to the one-loop approximation. after this, the path integral becomes gaussian and for
the eective action , related to z by z = exp(), we obtain (1) = (1)

tion), and

the operator  in (4) is dened as

 = g( d d)ab + 2ig(t c)ab f c

 + (1  1/)( d d)ab,

(5)

(6)

where t a are the su(2)-group generators taken in the adjoint representation. we choose the gauge
 = 1, which makes the third term in (6) vanish. we take the external eld potential to be abelian-
like

aa

 = na a,

f a
 = na f,

(7)

where na is a unit vector pointing in a certain direction in the color space.

let a

(a = 1, 2, 3) denote the eigenvalues of the color matrix (nct c), then we have |a| = (1, 1, 0).

finally, for the operator (6) we obtain:

 = g[  ig(nct c) a]2ab + ig(nct c)ab f.

(8)

following the ideas of [14], in order to model the vortex conguration in continuum yang-mills theory,
we take the external eld potential to be pure gauge on the surface of the cylinder  = const = r,
i.e.,

a =

i
g

1.

as a simple nonsingular conguration (corresponding to a thick vortex [14]), we take the gauge
eld potential in the s1 circle  = const = r, in the polar coordinates, in the form

a = ( a = /(2gr),   s1

0,   r3

( = 2, 3, 4),

( = )

with /g = const as the ux through the cylinder. as is well known, in this situation we can
introduce the 2-dimensional vector in the  plane

(13)

where x = rg a = /(2). the same eigenvalue a(k2, l) = a
corresponding ghost operator in (4).

(k2, l) is obviously obtained for the

after all the transformation described above we arrive at the nal formula for the 4-dimensional

eective action

where   r d4x = 2rr dx2dx3dx4 is the 4-volume of the space time.

in what follows we use the proper time representation

log a =

exp(sa), rea > 0,

(15)

which is valid once the subtraction is performed at the lower integration limit. next we transform
summation over l in (14) with the help of the identity

exp(

after performing necessary operations in (14) we obtain the 4-dimensional eective potential:

the nal integration over s is easily performed and we nd:

this formula, after replacements 2r by 1/t , and a by a0, corresponds to the well known nite
temperature (t 6= 0) result for the free energy of gluons [16] in the background of a constant a0
potential (see also, [17], [18]). similar calculations for the contribution of the 2-dimensional cylinder
give the result

v2 =

.

concerning the results obtained, it should be remarked that, rst, the bernoulli polinomials depend
on the argument dened modulo 1, and hence the eective potential conserves the z2 symmetry,
characteristic for vortices, and, second, evident renormalization of the result has been performed.
after summation of the two contributions is performed we obtain

v = v4 +

1

3r2 v2.

(20)

the second term for the 2-dimensional cylinder has been averaged over three possible orientations of
the coordinate axes with respect to the cylinder in the 4-dimensional space time and over the area
of its cross section. the nal result, with the terms independent of ga having been omitted, has
the simple form

v =

1

122r4 x(2  x)(1  x2),

x =


2

.

(21)

the result obtained coincides formally with that derived in [15] for the following conguration of
the 4-dimensional space time: a plane with a deleted point at the origin, and the potential a with
a singularity at a string going through the origin. this coincidence has a simple explanation:
in

4

both cases we have the same general topological situation, dened by the pontryagin index (10). it
should be mentioned, that in our case the background potential was dened on the cylinder and had
no singularity, while in the latter case, it was dened on a plane with a singularity at the origin,
and hence the complete basis with bessel functions had to be employed in calculating the functional
trace.

as in [15], the potential has minima (equal to zero) at x = 0 and x = 1, and, due to its periodic
properties, at all integer values of x, though, the potential has a jump of its derivative at these
points. the values of the ux that provide minimum for the eective potential, correspond to 1
values of the elementary wilson loop that goes along the contour c encircling the cylinder:

< w (c) >=

1
2

< tr p exp igzc

adx >= cos(x)

(22)

the same situation has already been reported in [15]. as was argued in recent publications (see,
e.g., [8], [9]), the value w (c) = 1 characterizes the vortices, that pierce the area of the large
wilson loop with gaussian distribution, thus providing for the area law and for the linear conning
potential.
