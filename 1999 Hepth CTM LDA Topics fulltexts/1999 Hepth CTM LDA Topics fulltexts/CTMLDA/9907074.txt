congurations realize four-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric eld theories interesting chirality properties. t-dual congurations found n = 1 orientifolds c2/zn singularities, explicitly constructed matched iia models. discussion enlightened several aspects string theory embedding eld theories. shown several seemingly exotic eects type iia construction perfectly smooth standard realization translated type iib picture. crucial fact feature peculiar mapping spacetime directions t-duality. specically, positive negative regions iia coordinate x7 mapped two dierent complex planes c2/zn iib model. provided extensive evidence fact, mainly based precise matching dierent type iia iib models. also would like stress type iib realization eld theories similar chiral gauge theories. points towards unied description string theory congurations yielding chiral eld theories. finally, even though centered understanding properties string theory congurations, type iib picture d3-brane probes constructed also presents advantages study large n limit eld theory. would interesting nd relation models chiral gauge theories point view ads/cft correspondence. acknowledgements 34 pleasure thank j.
