abstract

we study some quantum theories which are divergent but for which renor-

malization can be performed nonperturbatively and explicitly. the result is

a welldened, nite formulation of these theories, in which neither a cuto

nor a bare coupling constant appears. such theories describe contact inter-

actions between particles which are encoded into the boundary conditions of

the wavefunction rather than in the hamiltonian. it is the attempt to de-

scribe them in terms of conventional potentials or self-interactions that lead

to divergences.

we discover that, after renormalization, the dynamics is described by

a new operator (the principal operator (e) ): the schrodinger equation

for energy levels is replaced by the eigenvalue problem (e) = 0 for this

operator. (more generally, the resolvent of the hamiltonian has an explicit

formula in terms of the inverse of (e).) moreover the interactions are not

described by the boundary conditions (domain) of the operator, but by the

formula for it; i.e., by its action on smooth functions. even when the theory

cannot be explicitly solved, it can be given a nite formulation once this

operator is determined. it is then possible to apply standard approximation

methods; in particular we can determine the energy of bound states, which

would be impossible in petrurbation theory.

we propose to call such theories which are apparently divergent, but have

a nite formulation in terms of the principal operator, transnite quantum

theories. we construct some examples of such transnite quantum eld the-

ories: quantum mechanics with contact interactions, three body problem

with contact interactions, quantum elds (fermionic and bosonic) interact-

ing with a point source, many body problems with contact interactions, and

non-relativistic eld theory with polynomial interactions .

as an application we develop a theory of self-interacting bose elds in two

dimensions with an attractive self-interaction. the ground state is a bose-

condensate for which the conventional many body theory breaks down due to

divergences. the magnitude of the ground state energy grows exponentially

with the number of particles, rather than like a power law as for conventional

many body systems.

1 introduction

there is a fact about classical mechanics that is so basic that we dont even

call it a law of mechanics. perhaps it should be called the zeroth law of

mechanics:

all particles behave like free particles for short enough intervals of time.

in the language of modern analysis, the path of any particle is dierentiable,

so that it can be approximated by a straight line for small enough intervals

of time. there are other physical phenomena (such as diusion) where this

law does not hold. hence it is not a self-evident fact, but rather a law of

nature. newtons second law states that the deviation of the path from that

of a free particle is second order in time (when the path is viewed as a curve

in conguration space) and is given by the force divided by the mass.

in quantum mechanics we have a similar zeroth law as well. the propa-
gator (i.e., the integral kernel ht(x, y) =< x|eht|y >, where h = p2 + v (x)
is the hamiltonian operator) is a gaussian upto power law corrections:

ht(x, y) =

2 (cid:18)1 + o(t)(cid:19).

(of course this statement, just like the previous statement in classical me-

chanics, is true only for non-singular potentials. the quantum theory is

more forgiving of singularities than the classical theroy. we will consider

some singular situations later.)

now let us look at quantum eld theory. the analogous statement would

be that the correlation functions g(x, y) =< (x)(y) > of a quantum eld
 will approach those of a free eld theory when the distance |x y| between
points becomes small. this is however not true for realistic quantum eld

3

theories.

in quantum electrodynamics for example, quite the opposite is

true: the smaller the distance between points the larger the deviation of a

correlation function from that of the free theory. asymptotically free theories

(such as quantum chromodynamics) are better behaved: their correlators

do approach those of the free theory but the deviations are of order
rather than |x  y|.

log |xy|

thus if we apply conventional ideas of dynamics to such quantum eld

theories we will run into divergences. these have to be removed by the

unwieldy procedure of renormalization. this leads us to ask if there is another

way to formulate such theories: to describe the dynamics of the theory by

some operator (instead of the hamiltonian) which is able to describe the

logarithmic deviation from the free theory. we must rst construct such

a new picture by working within the traditional renormalization method

applied to simple model problems. once we learn the basic ideas we might

be able to deal with more realistic situations. in this paper we will propose

such a reformulation of renormalization by studying a series of examples,

starting from quantum mechanics (with singular potentials) and ending with

some non-relativistic eld theories.

such a new point of view is necessary, since the most fundamental theory

of nature-the standard model of elementaty particles- is a divergent quantum

eld theory. it was discovered in part by the requirement of renormalizabil-

ity: that the divergences can be removed order by order in perturbation

theory by redening the parameters. the main remaining problems in the

standard model are due to the unpleasantness left over from this procedure.

for example, the naturalness problem in the higgs sector is an extreme

4

sensitivity (quadratic dependence ) of observables (like the higgs mass) on

microscopic parameters.

there are also more practical reasons to look for a new formulation of

renormalization. one of the main obstacles to solving for the dynamics of

non-abelian gauge theories is also that its quantum theory is divergent. we

only know how to remove these divergences by perturbative renormalization.

but perturbation theory cannot describe the formation of bound states: a

serious problem since all the observable states of the theory are expected to

be bound states (connement).

there are also motivations that come from outside of particle physics. we

dont yet have a quantum theory of gravity due to the divergences that arise

in quantizing general relativity: this time the innities cannot be removed

by renormalization. perhaps a better understanding of renormalization will

lead to a way of quantizing non-renormalizable theories as well: there might

a be a non-trivial xed point for the renormalization group.

string theory is a serious candidate for a quantum theory of gravitation

and, possibly, even a unied theory of all forces. moreover it is a nite

theory. thus it may be the ultimate solution for many of the problems noted

above. however, it should be possible to account for the spectacular success

of renormalizable quantum eld theories at current energies without having

to resort to a new theory of spacetime at planck energies. there should be

a consistent nonperturbative formulation of quantum eld theories whether

or not the ultimate theory is a nite string theory. to draw an analogy, it is

possible to have a mathematically consistent formulation of continuum (uid)

mechanics even though the ultimate description of uids is in terms of a nite

5

(but enormously large ) number of particles. quantum eld theory should

have a self-contained formulation whether or not it is just an approximation

to a more fundamental theory.

we also mention another great success of the idea of renormalization: the

divergences that aicted the theory of second order phase transitions were

nally understood by wilsons development of the renormalization group.

new ideas on renormalization might also deepen our understanding of phase

transitions. we will give some examples in this paper.

thus, at the heart of each of the fundamental problems of modern theo-

retical physics is a divergent quantum theory. progress is not possible with-

out a better understanding of these innities. the situation is analogous to

knowing the basic laws of mechanics but without knowing calculus: anything

beyond the simplest examples are inaccessible. indeed it was a deeper under-

standing of the nature of innity (cantors work on the transnite numbers)

that made modern analysis possible and by extension the modern theory

of dynamical systems. we must look for examples which will help us de-

velop such a general theory of divergent quantum systems: a truly analytical

quantum mechanics.

we will start with simple quantum mechanical models with singular po-

tentials [1] and progress to systems with several degrees of freedom, the

three-body problem and then to non-relativistic eld theories. eventualy we

hope to formulate qcd in this way, but even the cases we have studied so

far address some physically interesting problems.

to be more precise, we have found a way to reformulate some quantum

theories that are divergent in the usual formulation in a new way that is

6

manifestly nite: there is no need for a regularization and all the parameters

are physical, not bare coupling constants. we call such systems transnite

quantum systems. in these systems, interactions are not specied by poten-

tials or any other simple modication of the hamiltonian operator:

indeed

on smooth wavefunctions the hamiltonian acts just like the free hamiltonian.

it is the attempt to shoehorn these system into a conventional description
in terms of a hamiltonian such as h = 2 + v (x) that leads us to diver-
gences. the interactions are encoded not into the formula for the hamilto-

nian but into the boundary conditions on the wavefunctions (i.e., domain of

self-adjointness of the hamiltonian). thus the resolvent of the hamiltonian

(which is a sort of greens function) contains the complete specication of the

system. the resolvent has the complete physical description of the system,

in terms of physical and not bare parameters.

upto this point the ideas are not very new: the resolvent has been worked

out in many simple cases, most notably by krein and his school [2]. unfortu-

nately in most cases, determining the resolvent is the same as exactly solving

the system. we need a way to think of such contact interactions which is

free from divergences and yet does not require us to solve the whole dynamics

rst: we just need to solve the singular part of the dynamics. our main

discovery is that there is a new operator, which we call the principal op-

erator (e), which describes the dynamics of transnite quantum systems.

it is free of divergences, can be determined explicitly (usually as an integral

operator) and is quite simple in many cases. there are no subtleties in the

denition of its domain: the interaction is described by a term in the formula

for (e). in this way the formulation of transnite quantum systems is no

7

more dicult than that of nite quantum systems.

the eigenvalues of energy are given by the solutions to (e)| >= 0;
the scattering amplitude is determined by the inverse of (e). of course

the solution of the eigenvalue equation or the inversion of (e) is a dicult

dynamical problem: as dicult as solving the schrodinger equations would

be in nite quantum systems. but the point is that it is no more complicated

than that: we can apply the standard methods such as variational principles

or perturbation theory to the principal operator, since now we have a formu-

lation free of divergences. the system need not be exactly solvable for it to

have a transnite formulation. formulating the system amounts to nding

the principal operator (e) while solving it amounts to inverting (e).

the principal operator can be thought of as an eective hamiltonian

obtained after integrating out (or eliminating) the short distance degrees of

freedom. this is reminiscent of wilsons program of renormalization. the

main new point is that we can get a closed experession for such an operator,

rather than give an implicit prescription to nd it as in wilsons program.

simple, exactly solvable , examples of such transnite quantum theories

have been known for a long time: the two dimensional delta function po-

tential is a good example [3]. we will in fact start our discussion with such

a simple example, the pole model of low energy scattering in quantum me-

chanics. it has been known for a long time that at momenta small compared

to the size of the scatterer, the scattering amplitude of a particle tends to
1ik , the number  being the scattering length.
for positive scattering length there is a bound state near threshold and for

a universal form f (k) =

1

negative scattering length a resonance (virtual bound state). but there is

8

no nite quantum system that can give this simple model of scattering am-

plitude: such a system can only be constructed as a limit of hamiltonians.

indeed this is a beautiful example of the idea of renormalization at work.

we will construct a transnite quantum theory of two body interactions that

describes exactly this case of low energy scattering.

these ideas are of interest in modern (late 1990s) atomic physics. tech-

nical advances in the cooling and trapping of atoms have made it possible

very recently to study experimentally the interaction of atoms at very low

momenta:

i.e., wavelengths large compared to the size of the atoms them-

selves. scattering lengths for several species have been measured. in the case

of rubidium and sodium the scattering length is positive while for lithium
it is negative. (e.g.,  = 27.3  0.8 bohr radii for lithium.) interspecies
scattering also should give a whole range of values of scattering lengths,

both positive and negative. indeed it is even possible to tune the scatter-

ing length to any desired value using feshbach resonances. thus many of

the phenomena associated to low energy scattering have become or will soon

become experimentally accessible. of greatest interest is the formation of

condensates of a large number of atoms. this would be described by a non-

relativistic eld theory (bosonic or fermionic) with a contact interaction. the

techniques developed may eventually be useful to study phase transitions in

such atomic condensates. so far we have a way to describe condensates in

two dimensional systems.

we will then pass to studying some eld theoretical models. t. d. lee

[4] introduced a simple model for renormalization which has been studied

further by many people. it describes a bose eld interacting with a point-

9

like source. the source itself has two possible states, which can be thought

of as describing the internal states of a heavy particle.

in the limit when

the size of the source goes to zero, there is an ultra-violet divergence in

this model: for example, the energy dierence between the two states of the

source is innite. this can be removed by a renormalization procedure: the

parameters of the model are made to depend on a cut-o ( the size of the

source ) in such a way that the energies of physical states are nite in the

limit as the cut-o is removed.

an even simpler, non-relativistic, limit of the lee model was studied in

ref. [5] ). the heavy particle was interpreted as the nucleon, its two states

being the neutron and the proton. the light (but non-relativistic) boson

was thought of as the charged pion. the energy of the neutron (more

precisely the neutron-proton mass dierence) is innite. this divergence can

be regularized by requiring the source to have a nite size 1 an ultra-

violet cuto. then we require a bare parameter  depend on  in such a

way that in the limit we get a nite answer for the neutron energy.

now we have much better descriptions of the nucleon pion system. the

static source model is thought of these days as a historical curiosity. but

this kind of model has, been very valuable as a proving ground for new

approaches to renormalization. the most spectacular example has been the

work of wilson, who also perfected his ideas on a variant of the static source

model [6]. a later (one dimensional) version of the static source model, the

kondo model, has become a classic example of renormalization. we will also

use the static source model and (later on, the kondo problem) to test our

ideas on renormalization.

10

the simplest example of such a eld theory we will study is a system of

(non-relativistic) fermions interacting with a point source. this fermionic

variant of the lee model also has a static source with two states: one of

these states is now a fermion and the other a boson. we will show that the

ultra-violet divergences can be removed by a nonperturbative renormalization

method. the energies are all nite and the theory in fact has a compeltely

nite description, with no cutos or bare coupling constants in sight. the

main lesson we learn is that renormalizable quantum eld theories of this type

( transnite) also have interactions that arise from the boundary conditions

of the wave function. hence the dynamical information is not encoded in the

hamiltonian, but in the the principal operator, (e), which we construct.

the spectrum of the principal operator determines the energy levels: the

schrodinger equation is replaced by the equation (e) = 0. although

the problem is not exactly solvable, we can apply traditional approximation

methods such as the variational principle once we have a nite form of the

theory. we wont be able to get all the energy levels: but we will show

that they are all nite and determine the ground state and rst excited state

energies.

we will then apply our methods to the bosonic static source model (the

original lee model). this case is more subtle. in fact the original analysis

of the lee model was incomplete: the divergences were shown to be removed

only in states which contain at most two bosons. the possibility remained

that the hamiltonian of the system is unbounded below, when the number of

bosons is more than two. this is not a mere technicality: there are systems

in which an analogous renormalization model still leaves behind divergent

11

energies for multi-particle states [7]. ( we will give such an example ourselves

later on in this paper.) we will show that the non-relativistic lee model has

energies bounded below in each sector with a xed number of bosons ( this

number is a conserved quantity of this model.) moreover we will make a

variational estimate of the ground state energy of the lee model in the limit

of a large number of bosons. thus it will be established that the lee model

is indeed free of divergences.

next, we will apply these ideas to the case of a system of non-relativistic

bosons in two dimensions, interacting though a contact interaction: non-

relativistic 4 theory in 2 + 1 dimensions. this model has been studied in

various guises by other authors as well [8, 9, 10], but our approach is some-

what dierent. we will obtain a closed form for the principal operator after

renormalization. we will then show how to solve the many body problem

in the mean eld approximation. in fact we will obtain a solution for the

wavefunction of the bosonic condensate in this aproximation, as well as its

energy.

2 scattering at low momentum and renor-

malization

in the limit of small momentum we should expect that the scattering ampli-

tude of two atoms does not depend on the details of the atomic form-factors:

the shape of the atoms should not matter at wavelengths much larger than

the atoms. this is a situation to which the philosophy of renormalization

applies perfectly: the cut-o is the size of the atom: the independence of

12

the atomic scattering amplitude on the shape of the atom arises from the

independence on the regularization scheme of the renormalized system. we

will now show in some detail how to perform this renormalization.

elastic scattering [11] of a particle by a heavy target is described by

the scattering amplitude f (k, n, n). ( of course the case of two-parcticle

scattering can be reduced to this case by passing to the center of mass frame.)
it is dened in terms of the asymptotic form of the wavefunction as r  ,

(k, x)  eikrnn



+ f (k, n, n)

eikr
r

.

(2)

here, k = kn is the momentum of the incoming wave and n = x

r is the
direction of the outgoing wave. conservation of probability requires the

unitarity condition on the scattering amplitude:

f (k, n, n)  f(k, n, n) = 2ik z f (k, n, n)f(k, n, n)



dn
4

.

let us also recall the formula for the total scattering cross-section:

(k) = z |f (k, n, n)|2dn

.

(3)

(4)

if a wave is scattered by a target whose size is small compared with the

wavelength, only the partial wave with zero angular momentum will scatter:

only this partial wave has an appreciable probability of interacting with the

target. thus the scattering amplitude will become independent of angles

in this limit, even if the target is not spherically symmetric. the unitarity

condition will then require that

imf (k) = k|f (k)|2.

(5)

13

in other words

im

1

f (k)

= k

(6)

thus, in the limit of vanishing momentum the scattering amplitude ap-

proaches a real constant (the unitarity condition requires the imaginary part

to be o(k)):

lim
k0

f (k, n, n) = .

(7)

the quantity  is called the scattering length. it can be either positive

or negative. it is stated in some textbooks that a positive scattering length

corresponds to a generally repulsive interaction and a negative one to an

attractive interaction. but this is only true of interactions that are weak

enough to be treated in the born expansion. we will in fact see that a

positive scattering length can even lead to a bound state.

now the imaginary part of

1
f (k) must be o(k) to satisfy the unitary con-

dition. in the limit of small but nonzero momentum we thus have,

1

f (k)

= ik 

or,

f (k, n, n) = 

1 + ik

1

(8)

(9)

.

in fact the scattering amplitude of any target whose size is small compared

to the wavelength is described asymptotically by this formula: even if the

target has no special property such as spherical symmetry. we will call this

the simple pole model for low momentum scattering. (due to wigner(1933)

and bethe and peierls (1935).) the scattering cross-section of the target will

14

be, in this model,

(k) = 42

1

1 + k22

.

(10)

this gives the geometrical meaning of the scattering length: at low momenta

the target will appear to be a hard sphere of radius .

the scattering amplitude has a simple pole at

k =

i


.

(11)

this pole is in the upper half of the complex k-plane for  > 0; it then

corresponds to a bound state of binding energy

2m2 . if  is negative, the
pole does not describe a bound state. poles of f (k) in the lower half of

1

the k-plane correspond to solutions of the schodinger equation that grow at

innity:

it corresponds to what is called a virtual level.( see [11] section

133.)

this simple picture for the scattering at low momenta however has an

important peculiarity: there is no hamiltonian of the form

h =

p2
2m

+ v (x)

(12)

with a potential function v (x) which can reproduce such a scattering ampli-

tude exactly. if there were such a potential, it would have zero range and

innite height (for positive ) or depth ( for negative .) v (x) cannot be

described even by a familiar distribution such as a delta function: the delta

function potential in three dimensions either has vanishing scattering ampli-

tude (repulsive case) or has no well-dened ground state (attractive case).

instead we have to view the hamiltonian as arising from a limit of poten-

tials, with widths tending to zero; the heights have to be carefully adjusted

15

as a function of the widths in this limit in order to get a non-vanishing scat-

tering amplitude or a nite ground state energy. this process of obtaining

a nite scattering amplitude from the limit of a sequence of potentials with

nite width is reminiscent of the renormalization program of quantum eld

theory; the width is the short-distance cut-o and the height (or depth) of

the potential the bare coupling constant. the main dierence from conven-

tional quantum eld theory is that the renormalization has to be carried out

non-perturbatively, since we expect to recover a bound state in some cases.

the answer will be independent of the details of the limiting process.

we will now show that there is in fact a perfectly welldened quantum

theory with the simple pole model above as the scattering amplitude.

its

hamiltonian is the same as that of the free particle as far its action on smooth

wavefunctions in position space is concerned. the interactions are encoded

into the boundary conditions of the wavefunction at short distances ( or at

innity in momentum space). thus the hamiltonian is practically useless

as a tool in studying this system. we will instead obtain a formula for

the resolvent of the regularized hamiltonian and take its limit as the cuto

is removed.

it will turn out that it is determined in terms of a function

(e) (the principal function): we get a version of the krein formula for

resolvents. the zeros of this principal function give the point spectrum of

the renomalized system.

when we have more than two particles, we can still preform the renormal-

ization as before and get a formula for the resolvent. however, this time the

principal function is replaced by an operator. in the case of the three body

problem, we can study the spectrum of this operator. if the dimension of

16

space is two, we show that this problem is well-posed and has a welldened

ground state energy. in the case of three-dimensional three body problem,

the ground state energy of the renormalized theory still diverges: there are

further renormalizations necessary. thus even if we can obtain a krein for-

mula and a principal operator, we still need to show that the spectrum is

bounded below in order to have a welldened theory. this is why we take

pains to establish this lower bound in the case of some quantum eld theories.

2.1 renormalized resolvent

consider a pair of particles with an attractive short range interaction. after

separating out the center of mass variable, we can reduce this to the scattering

of a particle of mass m (equal to the reduced mass of the pair) against an

immovable target representing the interaction between the particles. we

are interested in the limit as the inverse range of the interaction  is very

large compared to the momentum of the particle.

this can be modelled by the hamiltonian operator, in momentum space,

h(p) =

p2
2m

(p)  g()(p)z (q)(q)[dq].

(13)

here, (p) is a function that is equal to one near the origin and falls o

rapidly at innity. for example,

(p) = (|p| < )

(14)

would be a typical choice. the function g() will be picked later in such a
way that the scattering amplitude has a limit as   .

here, the interaction is represented by a separable kernel which makes

the calculations simple.

if instead we choose a potential of range 1

 we

17

will get similar answers in the limit    but the calculations are more
complicated.

consider the inhomogenous equation

(

p2

2m  e)(p)  g()(p)z (q)(q)[dq] = (p).

then

where a is

(p) =

(p)
p2
2m  e

+

a

p2

2m  e

(p)

a = g()z (p)(p)[dp].

(15)

(16)

(17)

we can put the expression for (q) into this equation for a to get,

a(cid:20)g1()  z

2
(p)
p2
2m  e

[dp](cid:21) = z (p)

(p)
p2
2m  e

[dp]

(18)

we now choose g() such that

g1()  z

2
(p)
p2
2m  e

[dp]

(19)

has a limit as   :

g1() = z 2

(p)

for some real constant .

1

p2

2m + 2

2m

[dp]

(20)

this number ( which has the dimension of momentum) is the true phys-

ical parameter which describes the strength of the interaction:

it remains

meaningful even in the limit as  goes to innity. if the bare coupling con-

stant g() is eliminated in favor of , all the divergences will dissappear: this

is the essence of renormalization. this kind of replacement of a (divergent)

18

coupling constant by a momentum scale is quite common in renormalization

theory. it is sometimes called dimensional transmutation.

then a will have a limit as   , and so will the solution (p) =

lim (p):

(p) =

(22)

this is a convergent integral. note that the limiting solution is independent

of the choice of (p).

now, the resolvent kernel is given by the formula,

(p) = z r(e; p, q)(q)[dp].

(23)

thus we get,

r(e; p, k) =

(2)d(p  k)

.

(24)

this is called the krein formula for the resolvent. we can regard our

limiting system as dened by this formula for the resolvent. the hamiltonian

from which this follows is, as a dierential operator, the same as that of the

free particle. the interaction is encoded into the boundary conditions at the

origin. the resolvent, being a greens function, encodes the information of

these boundary conditions as well. the function

1

(,e) gives thus a convenient

19

description of the interaction. we will see that this is (upto a constant) the

scattering amplitude.

thus the interactions of the theory are described by the function (, e).

apart from it, all the terms in the formula for the resolvent just involve the

free theory. we will see that with more than two particles, we still have

a similar formula, but the real valued function (, e) is replaced by an

operator valued function, the principal operator. this principal operator

acts on a reduced hilbert space which for the simple case ofthis section is

one dimensional. that is why we just have a function (, e) rather than

an operator.

2.2 the krein formula and boundary conditions

the resolvent of a dierential operator contains the information on its bound-

ary conditions as well. it is interesting to make explicit these boundary con-

ditions implied by the krein formula for the hamiltonian. these boundary

conditions determine the domain of the hamiltonian thought of as a self-

adjoint unbounded operator in l2(r3).

the domain of the hamiltonian is the range of its resolvent: the set of

functions in momentum space that can be written as

z r(e; p, k)(k)[dk]

for square integrable (k). thus for the free particle with resolvent

r0(e; p, k) =

(2)d(p  k)

p2

2m  e

20

(25)

(26)

we have the set

{(p) =

(p)
p2

2m  e|  l2(r3)}.

(27)

in other words, the domain of the free hamiltonian consists of wave functions

(p) for which both  and p2 are square integrable. in position space this

means that the domain of the free hamiltonian is the set of wavefunctions

that are square integrable and have square integrable second derivatives.

now let us ask how the form of the resolvent changes if we change the

domain of the hamiltonian. the dierence of the resolvent from its value for

a free particle is ( in position space)

r(e; x, y)  r0(e; x, y)

(28)

a homogenous solution of the schrodinger equation: two dierent greens

functions for the same dierential equation dier by a homogenous solution.

the simplest possibility is to change the behavior of the resolvent at one point

( say the origin) by putting there a pointlike scatterer. ( more complicated

modications are also allowed mathematically, but are not as interesting ).

then we must have, for d = 3,

r(e; x, y) = r0(e; x, y) + c(e)

ei(2me)|x|

ei(2me)|y|

|x|

|y|

(29)

for some constant c(e). we require that the additional term corespond

to outgoing waves at spatial innity, a physical requirement. the formula

for arbitrary d is similar and involves hankel functions. this means the
wavefunction can blow up at the origin as c(e)
|x|1 ; (or log |x| when d = 2).

note that such a singularity is still square integrable.

21

in momentum space this is of the form

r(e; p, k) =

(2)d(p  k)

p2

2m  e

+ b(e)

1

1

p2

2m  e

k2

2m  e

.

(30)

the quantity b(e) is determined by the condition that this operator be in

fact a resolvent:

r(e; p, k)  r(e; p, k)

e  e

= z r(e; p, k)r(e, k, k)[dk].

after some calculations we get

b1(e)  b1(e)

e  e

= z [dk]{

1

k2

2m  e

1

k2

2m  e}

or,

b1(e)  b1(e) = z [dk]{

(31)

(32)

(33)

1

1

k2

2m  e 

k2

2m  e}

but this is precisely what we got from renormalization: our quantity b(e)

is just the inverse of the (e) we had previously.

thus we see that the renormalized hamiltonian is just the free hamiltonian

with a modied boundary condition on the wavefunctions at the origin of

position space.

2.3 the scattering amplitude

consider the schrdinger equation for a free particle:

1
2m2 (x) = e (x).

(34)

suppose that e > 0.

if we require that the wavefunction be continuos

everywhere in space, we have the usual plane wave solution:

ceikx

22

(35)

with e = k2

2m . in momentum space this corresponds to a wavefunction

(2)d(p  q).

(36)

but this is not the only solution if we allow the solution to blow up at one

point (say the origin). this would mean that there is a static scatterer

of zero size sitting at the origin. we would still require the schrodinger

equation to hold away from the origin. hence the solution would have to

dier from the plane wave by a multiple of a homogenous solution of the

dierential equation, one that may diverge at the origin. this homogenous

solution represents the scattering by the particle at the origin; hence we

should require that it become an outgoing wave at innity:

(x) = eikx + f (k)

eikr
r

.

(37)

here the constant f (k) has the meaning of the scattering amplitude.

in

momentum space this becomes

(p) = (2)d(p  k) + f (k)

2
m

1
2m  k2
2m  i

p2

(38)

it being understood as usual that   0+.

we can now compare this with what we get from the formula for the

resolvent and see that the extra term in the resolvent is precisely of this

form:

(p) = (2)d(p  k) +

1
(, k2
2m + i)

this is in line with our argument that the krein formula for the resolvent de-

scribes a boundary condition on the wavefunction at the origin: it is allowed

to blow up.

23

1
2m  k2
2m  i

p2

.

(39)

thus we have a scattering amplitude that is independent of angles:

f (k) =

m
2(, k2
2m + i)

.

evaluating the integral,

(, e) =

m

2(cid:20)(2me  i)  (cid:21)

so that the scattering amplitude is

f (k) =

1

  ik

(40)

(41)

(42)

the sign is xed by the rule lim0(1  i)1/2 = i.

thus we nd exactly the simple pole model for the scattering amplitude

for low momenta that we had in the last section, with scattering length  = 1
 .
later on we will study the many body problem of particles with such

contact interactions. we will give a complete theory only in the simpler

case of two dimensional space. problems with the extension to the three

dimensional case will be described as well.

3 the fermions with a static source

since our fermionic variant of the lee model is simpler we will describe it

rst.

let (p), (p) be the creation-annihilation operators for a fermion eld
in d+1-dimensional space-time. they are represented on the fock space f
built from the vacuum |0 >:
[(p), (q)]+ = (2)d(p  q),

[(p), (q)]+ = 0 = [(p), (q)]+

(43)

24

and

we are mainly interested in the case d = 3 but our method applies for any

(p)|0 >= 0.

(44)

d < 4.

on f  c 2, dene the hamiltonian

h = h0 + h1

h0 = z [dp](p)(p)(p)

where,

and

h1 = 

1  3

2

+ gz [dp][(p)(p) + h.c.].

(45)

(46)

(47)

there is no loss in assuming that the coupling constant g > 0 since any phase

in g can be absorbed into a redenition of the eld (p). the quantity  is

a bare coupling constant whose dependence on  will be determined later

by renormalization.

the dispersion relation of the fermion eld is chosen to be non-relativistic:

p = m +

p2
2m

.

(48)

the pauli matrices , 3 act on c 2 in the usual way. there is a u(1)
symmetry (rather like isopin) which leads to the conserved quantity

q =

1  3

2

+ z [dp](p).

(49)

clearly, q  0.

this model describes the interaction of the fermions with some heavy

particles sitting at the origin. the function (p) is a sort of form-factor: it

25

describes the the internal structure of these heavy particles. for us it will

serve the purpose of an ultra-violet regulator, eg. we may choose

(p) = (|p| < )

(50)

for some momentum cut-o . in the limit    we will have point-like
heavy particles. but in this limit there is a uv divergence in the theory.

this divergence can be removed by renormalizing the constant . the nal

answer will not depend on the choice of the form-factor : any function

which is equal to one at the origin and falls of faster than any power at

innity will give the same answers. this is part of the universality of the

transnite theory: its independence on the regularization scheme.

our theory can be thought of as a model for the interaction of the top

and charm quarks with the higgs boson: the heavy boson is the higgs boson,

the heavy fermion the top quark and light fermion the charm quark. our
model is an approximation where mt, mh >> mc = m but |mtmh| << mc.
in this limit we would have the interaction of nonrelativistic b-quarks with

either a higgs boson or a top quark; the parameter  describes the mass

dierence betwen the two heavy particles.

it is certainly true that that mt >> mc and it is almost certain that

mh >> mc. it would be unusual for the higgs boson and the top quark to

have almost the same mass, as we are asuming. also, the higgs-top-charm

coupling is very small in the standard model (induced by higher loop eects)

but is not so small in some variants of the standard model (for example with

supersymmetry). thus our model describes a somewhat unusual possibility

in particle physics: but this has not yet been ruled out experimentally. in

any case we can use this system as a physical picture that guides our mathe-

26

matical analysis of this renormalization problem, much like the nucleon-pion

system in the lee model. more realistic cases can be studied later, once the

principles are established in this simple case.

in some extensions of the standard model (eg. the minimal supersym-

metric exension) there are charged higgs particles. in these models, a decay

of the top quark into a higgs boson and a bottom quark is possible. again,

if the higgs and the top quark happen to be almost degenerate, our model

will describe this system.

the hamiltonian can be expressed as a 2  2 block split according to c 2:

h = 


h0

g r [dp](p)(p)

g r [dp](p)(p)

h0 + 


 .

(51)

we will now construct the resolvent of this hamiltonian using some identities
given in the appendix. then we will show that the limit as    of
the resolvent exists: this is renormalization. after that we will study the

spectrum of the renormalized theory.

in the appendix, we work out some formulae for inverting operators split
into 2  2 blocks as above. in the notation used there, the resolvent iof the
regularized hamiltonian s

r(e) =

1

h  e

== 


 








(52)

where,

 =

1

h0  e

+

1

h0  e

b(e)1b

1

h0  e

,

 = 

1

h0  e

b(e)1 (53)

and

 = (e)1,

b = g z [dp](p)(p).

(54)

27

we express everything in terms of (e) since we will see that all the di-

vergences are removed once we have a proper denition for (e). once we

know , the resolvent is given by the above explicit formula.

indeed, we have,

(e) = h0  e +   g2z [dp][dq](p)(q)(p)

1

h0  e

(q).

(55)

now we normal-order the last term; i.e., we reorder the operators so that the

creation operators stand to the left of the annihilation operators. this can

be done using the identities

h0(q) = (q)[h0+(q)], (p)(q) = (q)(p)+(2)d(pq), (56)

thus

(e) = h0  e + g2 z [dp][dq](p)(q)(p)

1

h0 + (p) + (q)  e

(q)

(57)

+  g2z [dp]2

(p)

suppose we now choose

1

h0 + (p)  e

 =  + g2 z (p)2[dp]
(p)  

.

(58)

here  is a parameter independent of . moreover we will require that m > 

for simplicity. (this is not essential: it guarantees that both the heavy states

are stable against decay.)

the point of this choice of  is that it cancels the divergent part of

(e):

(e) = h0  e + g2 z [dpdq](p)

(p)(q)

h0 + (p) + (q)  e

(q)

28

g2 z [dp](p)2[

1

h0 + (p)  e 

1

(p)  

] + 

(59)

convergent if d < 4, since  = m + p2

the integrand of the last term behaves for large |p| like r [dp]
(p)2 :

it is
2m . thus we can take the limit as   
keeping  xed at a positive value less than m. then, the limiting operator

(e) = h0  e + g2z [dpdq](p)
h0 + (p)  e 

g2z [dp][

1

h0 + (p) + (q)  e

1

] + 

(p)  

1

(q)

(60)

exists. this is the renormalized form of the principal operator. w can just

put this into the earlier formula to get a formula for the resolvent.

3.1 the principal operator

to get more explicit expressions we specialize to the case d = 3. (in fact the

following arguments apply to any d < 4.) evaluating the integral,

(e) = h0  e +  + 42g2(2m)

+g2z [dpdq](p)

3

2 [(h0 + m  e)  (m  )]

1

(q)

(61)

h0 + (p) + (q)  e

this principal operator can be written as the sum of a kinetic (single par-

ticle) term

k(e) = h0  e +  + 42g2(2m)

3

2 [(h0 + m  e)  (m  )]

(62)

and an interaction term

u(e) = g2z [dpdq](p)

1

h0 + (p) + (q)  e

(q).

(63)

the fermion number operator n = r [dp](p)(p) commutes with (e).

29

the principal operator determines the dynamics of the theory. the re-

solvent of the hamiltonian of the renormalized theory is

r(e) = 


(e)

(e)

(e) (e)1




where

(e) =

1

h0  e

+

g

h0  e z [dq](q)

(e) z [dp](p)

g

h0  e

and

(64)

(65)

(66)

(e) = 

g

(e) z [dp](p)

1

.

h0  e

this can be thought of as a sort of krein formula for the resolvent of our

eld theory.

1

indirectly it denes the hamiltonian h as the operator for which r(e) =
he is the resolvent. but if we were to think of this renormalized hamiltonian
directly as an operator on the fermionic fock space, it would appear to be

just the free fermion operator. for example, consider the space of states

|f >= z f (p1    pn)(p1)    (pn)[dp1    dpn]|0 >

(67)

with smooth f (p1,   pn) decreasing at innity faster than any polynomial.
they correspond to fermionic wavefunctions that are smooth in position

space that also fall of faster than any polynomial. on these nice states,

the hamiltonian h of the transnite theory is the same the free hamiltonian:

h|f >= z [(p1) +    (pn)]f (p1    pn)(p1)    (pn)|0 > [dp1    dpn].

(68)

but this formula does not uniquely dene h as a self-adjoint operator. it

has many self-adjoint extensions, corresponding to dierent sets of boundary

30

conditions as the momenta go to innity. one of them is the free hamiltonian

h0, but there are other extensions too which dene interacting theories. the

interactions are hidden in the domain of denition of this unbounded opera-

tor: in other words in the boundary conditions of the fermion wavefunctions

in the limit of large momentum. it is quite awkward to think this way: for

example it would be dicult to calculate the spectrum of the renormalized

theory.

but the same information is contained in a more explicit form in the above

krein formula for the resolvent. the resolvent is a sort of greens function

which therefore contains also the information on the boundary conditions.

another way to understand it is that (away from the spectrum) the resolvent

is a bounded operator, so there is no need to specify its domain.

transnite eld theories are thus theories in which the interaction takes

place at innity in momentum space. we are still able to give a sensible

description of these theories.

3.2 the spectrum of the transnite theory

we saw that there is an explicit formula for the resolvent of the hamiltonian

in terms of the inverse of the principal operator. thus, all the dynamical

information about the theory is contained in its principal operator. for

the resolvent. there are no poles in

example the discrete spectrum of the hamiltonian correspond to the poles of
h0e : its spectrum is purely continuous.
thus the poles must arise from those of (e)1; i.e., roots of the equation

1

(e)|u >= 0

31

(69)

this equation now plays the role of the schrodinger eigenvalue problem in the

transnite theory. the residue of the pole of the resolvent is the projection

operator to the corresponding eignspace of h. thus the eigenvector of h

corresponding to a root e0 of the principal operator is given by 2




g

h0e0 r [dp](p)|u >

|u >


 .

(70)

this is because the residue of a pole in the resolvent is the projection operator

to the eigenspace with that eigenvalue. we can read o this residue and see

that it is the projection to the above state, once a root of the equation
(e)|u >= 0 is found.

an example is the vacuum state:

(e)|0 >= (  e +  + g2(2m)

3

2 [(m  e)  (m  )])|0 > .

there is a root when

e = .

(71)

(72)

since  < m, it is not in the spectrum of h0. the corresponding eigenvector

of the hamiltonian is




g

h0 r [dp](p)|0 >

|0 >


 .

(73)

it contains a fermion in the rst entry, so it is not the vacuum in the
whole hilbert space f  c 2. in spite of this, it is the state of lowest energy-
the ground state- when  < 0. (proof is in the next section). when m >

2this root is assumed not be in the spectrum of h0.

in this case it would be be

embedded in the continuous spectrum of h and should be unstable. we will deal with the

continuous spectrum of h later.

32

 > 0 the above state is the rst excited state.( the ground state is just the

vacuum state 


|0 >
0


.) when  > m, we dont get an eigenstate of the

hamiltonian since this state is then unstable. (the ground state in this case

is also


|0 >
0


.)

more generally, the spectrum of the hamiltonian is the set of values of

e at which the resolvent either does not exist (discrete spectrum) or exists

but is unbounded (continuous spectrum). thus the continuous spectrum will

be that of h0 plus the values of e at which (e) does not have a bounded

inverse.

3.3 proof that the ground state energy is finite

in order to see that we have exorcised all the innities, we must show not
only that the resolvent of the hamiltonian exists in the limit as    but
also that the ground state energy is nite. this is nontrivial to prove since

we will see that there are many theories where even after a renormalization

there are further divergences which make the spectrum not bounded below.
we will estimate the norm ||(e)1|| for the case e < ; our aim is to
show that this is nite. then the ground state energy is either zero (when

 > 0) or is equal to .

it is sucient to consider the sector with the fermion number held xed

at some value n, since (e) preserves this number.

recall that (e) = k(e) + u(e) with

k(e) = h0  e +  + 42g2(2m)

3

2 [(h0 + m  e)  (m  )]

(74)

33

and

moreover,

u(e) = g2z [dpdq](p)

1

h0 + (p) + (q)  e

(q).

(75)

k(e)  nm + (  e), u(e)  0.

(76)

the inequalities become equalities when the fermion number is zero.

now write,

(e) = k(e)

1

2 [1 + u (e)]k(e)

1
2 ,

u(e) = k(e) 1

2 u(e)k(e) 1
2 .

(77)

since u (e)  0,

||(e)1||  ||k(e)1|| ||[1 + u (e)]1||

 [nm + (  e)]1


1

.

  e

(78)

this shows that (e) has spectrum bounded below by .

this simple method is not sucient to determine the ground state in the

bosonic case. we will have to supplement it with a sort of mean eld theory.

4 the lee model

the lee model has a charged bosonic eld satisfying:

[(p), (q)] = (2)d(p  q),

[(p), (q)] = 0 = [(p), (q)].

(79)

the bosonic fock space b is built from the vacuum in the usual way:

(p)|0 >= 0.

34

(80)

again, the complete hilbert space of the system is b  c 2.

the hamiltonian is, again,

h = h0 + h1

h0 = z [dp](p)(p)p

with

and

h1 = 

1  3

2

+ g z [dp][(p)(p) + h.c.].

(81)

(82)

(83)

some of the methods are the same as in the fermionic case; we will then omit

the details. but the bosonic case requires some new analysis as well.

the divergences are removed as before by normal ordering and choosing

the bare mass dierence to be

 =  + g2 z (p)2[dp]
(p)  

.

in the limit the resolvent has the form:

r(e) = lim


1

h  e

= 

h0  e z [dq](q)
(e) = 

+

1

1

(e) z [dp](p)

(e)

 ;
(e) z [dp](p)

(e) =

h0  e

and nally

(84)

(85)

;

(86)

(87)

(e) = h0  e +  + 42g2(2m)

g2 z [dpdq](p)

3

2 [(h0 + m  e)  (m  )]

1

(q).

(88)

h0 + (p) + (q)  e

35

other than the sign of the last term the answer is essentially the same as

before. but this sign makes an important dierence.

the proton is the state 


|0 >
0


 and it is an eigenstate of the renormal-

ized hamiltonian with eigenvalue zero. the neutron is an eigenstate of the

hamiltonian,




it corresponds the root of

g

h0 r [dp](p)|0 >

|0 >


 .

(89)

(e)|0 >= (  e +  + g2(2m)

3

2 [(m  e)  (m  )])|0 >

(90)

with e = . thus the parameter  is the renomalized value of the neutron-

proton mass dierence. so it is reasonable to assume m >  > 0.

but is the proton the state of least energy? could there be states which

contain many bosons that have a lower energy?. is there even a ground state?

these questions can be answered by studying the principal operator (e).

4.1

lower bound for the ground state energy

we will estimate the norm ||(e)1|| for the case e < . it is sucient to
consider the sector with the number of bosons held xed at n, since (e)

preserves this number.

let us dene the kinetic part of (e) to be:

k(e) = h0  e +  + 42g2(2m)

3

2 [(h0 + m  e)  (m  )].

(91)

clearly,

k(e)  nm + (  e).

(92)

36

dene u(e) to be the potential part of (e):

(e)  k(e)  u(e).

(93)

notice that (e) is now the dierence of two positive oeprators rather than

the sum as in the fermionic case. this is what makes the bosonic case more

complicated.

as before,

where

also,

i.e.,

(e) = k(e)

1

2 [1  u (e)]k(e)

1
2

u (e) = k(e) 1

2 u(e)k(e) 1
2 .

||(e)1||  ||k(e)1|| ||[1  u (e)]1||;

||(e)1||  [nm + (  e)]1||[1  u (e)]1||.

now, by explicit calculation,

(94)

(95)

(96)

(97)

u (e) = g2z [dpdq](p)(cid:20)

1

k(e  p)

1

2 (h0 + p + q  e)k(e  q)

2 (cid:21)(q).

1

(98)

thus, (remembering that inside the square bracket the boson number is
n  1),

u (e)  g2z [dpdq](p)[(n  1)m +   e + p] 1

2

[(n  1)m + p + q  e]1
[(n  1)m +   e + q] 1

2 (q).

(99)

37

also, in the sector with n bosons,

||z (p)u(p, q)(q)[dpdq]||  n(cid:20)z |u(p, q)|2[dpdq](cid:21)

1
2

.

(100)

combining these, we get

|| u(e)||2  g4n2 z [dpdq][(n  1)m +   e + p]1

[(n  1)m + p + q  e]2
[(n  1)m +   e + q]1.

(101)

now we put in (p) = p2

2m + m.in the middle factor we can replace an m by

a  since m > :

[(n  1)m + 2m +

p2
2m

+

q2
2m  e]2 < [nm +  +

p2
2m

+

q2
2m  e]2. (102)

this makes all the constants in the denominators the same so that we can

scale them out to get

|| u(e)||2  g4n2

(2m)3

[nm +   e]
[dpdq]

z

(1 + p2)(1 + q2)(1 + p2 + q2)2

.

(103)

the integral is convergent. working our way back to the beginning,

||(e)||1 

1

(nm +   e)

1

(cid:20)(nm +   e)  g2n(2m)

3

2 c(cid:21)

(104)

where

c 2 = z

[dpdq]

(1 + p2)(1 + q2)(1 + p2 + q2)2

.

(105)

if e is to be an eigenvalue of energy, it must be big enough to make the

denominators on the r.h.s. vanish; otherwise, (e)1 would remain bounded.

38

this means there is a lower bound on all eigenvalues, which really is the same

as a lower bound on the ground state energy:

egr  (nm + )  n2g4(2m)3c 2.

(106)

thus we see that in each sector with a xed number of bosons, there is a

ground state. however, there is still the possibility that the ground state

energy diverges as n grows to innity. in this limit we should expect all the

bosons to settle into the same state. the ground state of the free theory

has all the bosons in the zero momentum state. in the interacting theory,

the ground state could in general be something quite dierent. for example,

the bosons might settle into a state which is concentrated at the origin.

the dierence between that bosonic number density and its free eld value

is called the boson condensate. whether such a nonzero condensate of

bosons forms cannot be settled by the present analysis: we need to study the
limit as n  .

4.2 the large n limit of the lee model

in the limit that the number of bosons becomes large, we should be able to

use mean eld theory. we would expect all the bosons to occupy the same

state u(p). this state is normalized so that the occupation number is n:

||u||2 = z |u(p)|2[dp] = n.

(107)

in the limit n  , operators can be approximated by their expectation
values in this state: a kind of mean eld theory. they will then become

39

functions on the space of such states, the complex projective space3 of l2(r3).

thus our principal operator becomes the principal function

(e, u) = h0(u)  e +  + 42g2(2m)
u(p)u(q)

g2 z [dpdq]

h0(u) + (p) + (q)  e

here,

h0(u) = z (p)|u(p)|2[dp].

3

2 [(h0(u) + m  e)  (m  )]

.

(108)

(109)

we must solve (e, u) = 0 to get e as a function of e. then we must nd

the u that gives the smallest such e, subject to the constraint on the norm
||u||2 = n.

it is convenient to reexpress the problem in terms of some new variables.

the principal function depends on e only through the combination

 = z (p)|u(p)|2[dp]  e.

(110)

so dene,

f (, u) =  +  + (2g)2(2m)

g2 z [dpdq]

u(p)u(q)

 + (p) + (q)

3

2 [( + m)  (m  )]

.

(111)

then  is determined by the equation f (, u) = 0 and e by

e = nm +

1

2m z p2|u(p)|2[dp]  .

(112)

putting in the explicit form of (p),

f (, u) =  +  + (2g)2(2m)

3

2 [( + m)  (m  )]

3there is no physical eect if u is replaced by eiu. the space of vectors of xed length,

modulo a phase, is complex projective space.

40

2mg2 z [dpdq]

u(p)u(q)

p2 + q2 + 2m( + 2m)

.

(113)

we now make the change of variables

u(p) = n [2m(2m + )]

3

2 v([2m(2m + )]p).

(114)

the change of scale of momentum will simplify the denominator in the inte-
gral for f (, u). the overall factor of n turns the normalization condition
into

z |v(p)|2[dp] = 1

so that we can separate out the n dependence.

now we have

e = nm   + n( + 2m)z p2|v(p)|2[dp],

(115)

(116)

and

f (, u) =  +  + (2g)2(2m)

  m  (2g)2(2m)

.(119)

(recall that  < m). thus we can solve for  in terms of the r.h.s. as a mono-
tonically increasing function as well. its minimum values is , attanined
when the r.h.s. is zero. thus, we have

where

u = g2(2m)

3

2 z [dpdq]

v(p)v(q)
p2 + q2 + 1

(120)

(121)

and f1 is monotonically increasing. (we wont need an explicit form for f1.)

now put this it into the expression for energy:

e = nm +  + (2m  )k + f1(nu)[nk  1]

where

k = z [dp]p2|v(p)|2.

(122)

(123)

now suppose we replace v(p) by va(p) = a 3

2 v(a1p). let k(va) =

ka(v), e(va) = ea(v) etc. now, ka = a2k and ua = a4u: as a function of a

both ka and ua are increasing. then ea is also a monotonically increasing

function of a; the minimum for ea will occur at a = 0 and k, u = 0. thus

we nd that the groundstate energy is just

e = nm + .

(124)

all the bosons are in the zero momentum state in the large n limit: there is no

condensate. in other words the ground state of the bosonic eld is essentially

the same as in the free theory: the interaction is not strong enough to modify

the ground state substantially. we will see examples later where the ground

state is aected by the interaction.

42

5 the 4

2+1n r model

so far we considered theories where the coupling constants did not need

to be renormalized.

in fact the uv divergence was removed by a normal

ordering of the principal operator. now we will study a system where the

coupling constant needs to be renormalized: in fact one that is asymptotically

free[12, 3][13][14] we will discover a trick of introducing ctitious degrees of

freedom (angels) which will help us reduce the renormalization again to a

normal ordering of the principal operator.

the theory of interest is the nonrelativistic scalar eld theory in two

space dimensions, with a 4 interaction. this is the many body problem

of non-relativistic bosons interacting through a delta function potential.

it is well-known that, the two body problem has an ultra-violet divergence

which can be removed by a coupling constant renormalization. in ref. [15]

the few body problem was studied by quantum mechanical renormalization

methods. in this section we will renormalize this model by viewing it as a

non-relativistic quantum eld theory: in other words we will study the many

body problem. we will carry out the analysis in part for arbitrary d; this

will show why our renormalization method is not sucient for d = 3.

dene, on the bosonic fock space b, the regularized hamiltonian operator
(125)

h = h0 + h1

where

and

h0 = z p2

2

(p)(p)[dp]

(126)

h1 = g()z [dp1dp2dp1dp2](p1  p2)(p1  p2)

43

(2)d(p1 + p2  p1  p2)(p1)(p2)(p1)(p2).

(127)

here

(p) = (|p| < )

(128)

as before. the dimensionless constant g() is positive which corresponds to

an attractive interaction between the bosons. we have shown elsewhere that
[15] there is an ultra-violet divergence as   , which can be removed by
renormalizing the coupling constant. our aim is to get a manifestly nite

expression for the resolvent of the renormalized quantum eld theory.

now we will introduce a little trick that simplies our problem: we will

introduce new particles called angels that describe a bound state of a pair

of bosons. however, they are created by operators with unusual dening

relations: these are necessary to avoid over-counting the number of degrees

of freedom.

5.1 angels

dene operators satisfying

(p)(q) = (2)d(p  q), (p)(q) = 0 = (p)(q).

(129)

note that it is the product and not the commutator that appears here. these
operators can be represented on the hilbert space c  l2(rd). we can
regard (p) as creating an entity (we will give it the somewhat whimsical

name angel) out of the empty state represented by c. there can be at most

one angel in any state: that is the meaning of the product of the creation

operators being zero. (this is an extreme example of the exclusion statistics

considered in some other contexts.)

44

now consider an augmentation of the bosonic hilbert space, b = b b 

l2(rd). on it dene the hamiltonian

h = h00 + z [dp1dp2dp3](p1  p2)

(p1)(p2)(p3)(2)d(p1 + p2  p3) + h.c.(cid:21) +

1

g()

1. (130)

here 0 is the projection operator to the subspace containing no angel :

0 = z [dp](p)(p),

(131)

and 1 the projection operator to the subspace with exactly one angel:

1 = z [dp](p)(p).

(132)

the point of introducing angels is this: the projection of the resolvent
of the h, to the b (the sector with no angels) is just the resolvent of the
original bosonic system. but we will get another formula for this resolvent,
using angels, which has a nite limit as   . indeed we will see that
the innity is avoided by keeping the energy of the bound state of a pair of

bosons xed in this limit; an angel is essentially such a bound state.

let us split the hilbert space according to the angel number, with a

corresponding splitting of the operator:

h  e0 = 


a b

b

d




(133)

with

a : b  b,

b : b  l2(rd)  b, d : b  l2(rd)  b  l2(rd).

(134)

dene an operator r(e) split in the same way:

r(e) =

= 


 






 .

1

h  e0
45

(135)

we claim that

(136)
i.e., r projected to b is just the resolvent of h. to see this, we use the
formula we obtained earlier:

h  e

1

 = [a  bd1b]1.

d =

a = h0  e,

this gives

if we use

g()z [dp1dp2dp3](p1  p2)(p1)(p2)(p3)

a1b(e)1ba1

h  e

4 we hope there will be no confusion in using the same symbol d both for an operator

(p)(p) = (2)d(p  p)

we will get the required result.

but we have another formula for this resolvent:

 = a1 + a1b[d  ba1b]1a1.

this will give,

1

and the dimension.

46

where

(e) =

1

g()  z [dp1dp2dp1dp2](p1  p2)(p1  p2)
(p1 + p2)(cid:20)(p1)(p2)

(p1)(p2)(cid:21)(p1 + p2).(143)

1

h0  e

we can regard b as the operator that converts a pair of bosons into an angel.

then (e) is a kind of eective hamiltonian in the sector with one angel

and two fewer bosons: its zeros are energy levels of the manybody problem.

note that in this way of writing the resolvent of h, the coupling constant

appears additively!

its renormalization can be done by separating out a

divergent constant from (e). we will do this by normal ordering the

operators in (e).

using the canonical commutation relations and

h0(p) = (p)h0 +

p2
2

(144)

we can rewrite the quantity in the square brackets above equation as

(p1)(p2)

h0 + (p1) + (p2) + (p1) + (p2)  e

(p1)(p2)

1

+(2)d(p1  p1)(p2)

h0 + (p1) + (p2)  e
h0 + (p1) + (p2)  e

(145)

47

this gives,

(e) = g1()  z [dp1dp2dp1dp2](p1  p2)(p1  p2)

now we can take the limit as   . the only divergent term is the
last one. if we choose for g() the expression from the two-body problem,

g1() =

this divergence will cancel yielding a nite expression for (e) as   .

notice that the dependence on the cut-o of the previous operator is traded

for a dependence on the renormalization scale .

(151)

which is the analogue of the krein formula in the case of the manybody

problem.

5.2 the principal operator

now let us understand the spectrum of the theory in the special case d = 2.

we will be mostly interested in eignestates with e < 0: the bound states of

the system. in each sector with a xed number of particles we expect the

ground state to be of this form. ( we will make some remarks later on the

case d = 3 where we will see that the ideas in this section will not work in

that case.)

then,

(

2

2

) =

ln

4

2
2

.

we can rescale all the momenta by (|e|) to get
2 + w(cid:21),

(, e) = (cid:20) 1

ln |e|

2

49

(152)

(153)

where

w =

1

2 z [dp](p) log(cid:20)h0 + (p) + 1(cid:21)(p)
z [dp1dp2dp1dp2](p1 + p2)(cid:20)
(p1)(p2)

h0 + (p1) + (p2) + (p1) + (p2) + 1

(p1 + p2).

h0 + (p1) + (p2) + (p2) + 1

(p1)(p2)
(p2)(cid:21)

(154)

thus nding the bound state energy of our manybody system amounts

to nding the eigenvalues of w :

w| >= w, e = 2e2w

(155)

the special case of the three body problem was studied in previous papers

[15]. we showed not only that the ground state energy is nite, but that it

can be estimated by a simple variational ansatz. since we have described it

elsewhere, we wont elaborate on this point here.

5.3 bosonic condensation in two dimensions

we will now discuss the case of a large number of particles: how to do

transnite quantum many body theory. we will only discuss the mean eld

approximation, which should be good in the limit of a large number of par-

ticles. in the ground state, we should expect all the bosons to condense to a

common state u(p). thus the problem is to determine the pair of functions

u(p), (p), where (p) being the wavefunction of the angel. the wavefunction

u(p) describes a condensate of bosons, which breaks translation invariance.

50

of course there is no bose-einstein condensation for free bosons in two di-

mensions. what we will show is that with an attractive interaction of zero

range there is in fact such a condensation.

the expectation value of the operator w in the state |u >,  > becomes,

(for large n) the principal function u,

u =

1

2 z [dp]|(p)|2 log[nh0(u) + (p) + 1]
z [dp1dp2dp1dp2](p1 + p2)(p1 + p2)
u(p1)u(p2)u(p1)u(p2)n(n  1)
(cid:20)
nh0(u) + (p1) + (p2) + (p1) + (p2) + 1
(2)2(p1  p1)nu(p2)u(p2)
nh0(u) + (p1) + (p2) + (p2) + 1(cid:21)

+4

where

h0(u) = z |u(p)|2(p)[dp].

this u is to be minimized subject to the normalization conditions

z |u(p)|2[dp] = z |(p)|2[dp] = 1.

(156)

(157)

(158)

to get more explicit answers, let us ignore all except the leading terms as
n  :

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r (p1 + p2)u(p1)u(p2)[dp1dp2](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

u = n

eliminating  gives

where,

we will determine  by solving the variational problem. determination of

the c1 takes more work which we will not carry out here. : it is not needed

to determine the leading large n behavior

it is more convenient to use the corresponding expressions in position

space, with u(x) = r u(p)eipx[dp] etc.

i[u] = r |u(x)|2dxr 1

2|u(x)|2dx

r |u(x)|4dx

.

(164)

we can see that this amounts to solving a nonlinear dierential equation,

which can be derived by minimizing log i[u]:

2 u   u + g|u|2u = 0.

(165)

here,

 = r |u|2d2x
r |u|2d2x

,

g = r |u|2d2x
r |u|4d2x

.

(166)

the above partial dierential equation (but without the constraints on 

and g) has been studied in [16], theorem 6.7.25. ( we just need the special

case of dimension two.) there is a normalizable solution for every positive 

and g. in fact it is enough to nd the solution for a particular pair of values

of these constants. for example, let u1 be a solution of

2u1  u1 + |u1|2u1 = 0.

(167)

52

then, u(x) = au1(bx) will solve the general equation with

 = b2,

g = a2b1.

(168)

the quantity i[u] is invariant under such scale transformations: i[u1] = i[u].

so it is enough to solve the special case.

being the ground state of a many body problem, we should expect the

solution to be real and have circular symmetry around a point . thus we

only have to solve an ode, a kind of nonlinear bessels equation

v(r) +

1
4r2

v(r) +

v3(r)

r

= v(r)

(169)

with u(x) = rv(r) and r = |x|. that a square integrable solution exists is

proven5 in ref. [16].

we can get a value for   12 by numerical solution of the ode. we also
get this way the shape of the soliton (or condensate ); i.e., the wavefunction

of the bound state of a large number of bosons with pointlike interactions.

we plot below the solution u(r); as shown above, the scales of the u and r

axes are not physically relevant. the wavefunction is peaked at the origin and

decays exponentially at innity. the ground state thus breaks translation

invariance but not rotation invariance.6

5there is a typo in equation  of ref. [16], p. 384; the 1

4r2 v(r) term is missing. it does

not appear to aect the rest of the argument.

6 i thank govind krishnaswami for solving the ode numerically and producing the

graph.

one important conclusion of our analysis is that the magnitude of the

ground state energy grows exponentially with the number of particles:

(170)

if we had a non-singular pairwise interaction, we would expect the magni-

tude of the ground state energy to grow like the number of pairs; i.e., like

n2.

5.4 vortices in superconductors

a limiting case of the landau-ginzberg theory of superconductivity gives a

realization of the example we have been discussing. the lagrangian of this

eld theory is

l = z ||2d3x +

1

2 z |curla|2d3x + z (||2  a2)2.

(171)

54

here,  is a complex valued function on r3, a a covariant vector eld de-

scribing the gauge potential, and

 =   iea

(172)

the covariant derivative. if  > 1 (type ii superconductor) this lagrangian

has a static solution that is cylindrically symmetric around a point in a

plane r2 and translationally invariant in the orthogonal direction, carrying

a unit of magnetic ux. alontthe axis of symmetry, the eld  vanishes.

two such vortices have a repulsive interaction: the energy decreases as the

position of the zeros of  move further apart in the plane. ( for given ux

per unit area, the solution that minimizes energy density is a triangular
lattice-the abrikosov lattice.) as   1+ the force vanishes and the energy
is independent of the position ofthe zeros. (as   1, the force vanishes
at nite distances, but leads to a residual attractive contact interaction.) in

fact for any integer n there is a solution carrying n units of magnetic ux,

with zeros of  at any prescribed set of n points on the plane [19].

thus this vortices behave like identical free particles, located at the po-

sition of the zeros of the eld . we can now consider an approximate

quantization of this system where onoy the modes of the eld that carry

innitesimal energy are excited. this is just the quantum mechanics of n

identical particles on the plane ( the classical thermodynamics of this sys-

tem has been studied in [20].) in the simplest quantization scheme, we can

assume these particles are bosons. there is no potential energy between

them, if  has exactly the critical value.

however, as we saw earlier, there might be more subtle interactions that

arise from the boundary conditions on the wavefunctions; the boundary being

55

the region where a pair of particles come together. such contact interactions

seem to have been ignored in the literature on this subject:they arise if we

approach the limit  = 1 from below rather than above. these lead to bound

states of vortices, with an energy that is determined by a new short distance

scale  exactly as discussed previously. in fact it is also possible to have a

condensate of a large number n of vortices with a mean density of vortices
(or magnetic ux) given by the function |u(r)|2 determined in the last sec-
tion. it is of much interest to serach experimentally for such a condensation

of vortices in supercondutors which are on the borderline between type i

and type ii. the prediction that the energy of such a conguration depends

exponentially on the number of vortices also should be tested experimentally.

scalar field in three dimensions: a cau-

tionary tale

now let us see why the above approach cannot work as it stands in three

dimensions. although a renormalized resolvent and a principal operator can

be constructed, the spectrum is not bounded below for more than two parti-

cles. (however there may be other aproaches that give a sensible formulation

of this problem. see e.g., [18].

we get again, a krein formula:

r(e) =

1

h0  e

+

1

h0  e

b

1

(, e)

b

1

h0  e

.

(173)

the eigenvalues are given by (e)| >= 0. again, we can rescale all the

56

momenta by |e| to get

(, e) = (cid:20) 


16

+ |e| w(cid:21),

(174)

where

w =

1

8 z [dp](p)(cid:20)h0 + (p) + 1(cid:21)(p)
z [dp1dp2dp1dp2](p1 + p2)(cid:20)
(p1)(p2)

h0 + (p1) + (p2) + (p1) + (p2) + 1

1

+4(2)d(p1  p1)(p2)
(p1 + p2).

h0 + (p1) + (p2) + (p2) + 1

(p1)(p2)
(p2)(cid:21)

(175)

this time the new eigenvalues of the interacting system are given in terms

of the eigenvalues wn of w by

en = (cid:18) 

16(cid:19)2 1

w2
n

.

(176)

the operator w itself depends on no parameters: it determines the spectrum

of the interacting theory in terms of the parameter . our system will have a

nite ground state energy if and only if w is strictly positive. the eigenvalue

closest to zero of w will give the ground state energy by the above formula.

so far everything looks ne:

it looks like the same approach as in two

dimensions is going to work. but we will now see that in the three body

sector the operator w has a zero eigenvalue which mens the energy of the

ground state is innite.

in the sector of interest we have just one angel and one boson. the states

will have the form

| >= z [dp][dk](p|k)(k)(p)|0 > .

(177)

57

only the rst two terms in the principal operator will constribute to this

sector. the eigenvalue problem for w becomes an integral equation for :

(178)

the total momentum p + k of the angel and the boson is conserved. by going
to the center of mass frame, we impose p = k:

angular momentum: u(k) = u(k). performing the angular integration gives

|e|

we will now ask whether the ground state energy determined by this

integral equation is nite; in other words if there are solutions to this equation
for large |e|. we use the same ideas as the corresponding argument in two
dimensions and see why they break down [17],[15].

58

we rewrite the equation as

v(x) = z 

0

ue(x, y)v(y)dy

where

ue(x, y) =

1
+ (1 + 3

2 x2)(cid:21)

log(cid:20)

(cid:20)  |e|

1

2 + x2 + y2 + xy

2 + x2 + y2  xy(cid:21)

1

(182)

(183)

the question is whether this equation has a normalizable solution for large
|e|; if such a solutions exists, the three body problem has a divergent ground
state energy even after our renormalization.

the idea in two dimension is to show that the hilbert-schmidt norm
||ue||2 of this integral kernel is less than one as |e| becomes large . then
the equation v = kev will have no solution for large |e|. but in our case
this will diverge. in fact,

||ke||2

2 = z

z

ke(x, y)2dxdy

(184)

consider rst the integral over y:

g(x) = z

2 + x2 + y2 + xy

2 + x2 + y2  xy(cid:21)(cid:27)2

1

dy.

(185)

we will rst show that there exists a constant c such that

g(x)  cx

for large x. by scaling y  xy this equivalent to showing that

z 
0 (cid:26) log(cid:20)

for large positive x. now,

1

2x2 + 1 + y2 + y

2x2 + 1 + y2  y(cid:21)(cid:27)2

1

dy  c

(186)

(187)

z

2x2 + 1 + y2 + y

2x2 + 1 + y2  y(cid:21)(cid:27)2

1

dy  z 

0 (cid:26) log(cid:20) 1 + y2 + y

1 + y2  y(cid:21)(cid:27)2

dy = c (188)

59

the integral converges (in fact has a value of about c  3.489). thus we
see that

||ke||2 = z 

0

1
+ (1 + 3

2 x2)(cid:21)2 g(x)dx

2(cid:20)  |e|

(189)

but this diverges logarithmically, since the integrand goes like 1

x for large
x. the corresponding integral in two dimensions converges which makes the

problem well-posed there. this is why the proof breaks down here.

in fact we can just put |e| =  and see that there is a normalizable
solution for v. it can be determined by iterating the integral equation starting

from the trial function v0(x) = (1 + 3

2 x2)1. we spare the reader the details.

7 appendix: an elementary formula for in-

verses

suppose a self-adjoint operator x : h  h can be split into 2  2 blocks,

x = 


a b

b

d




(190)

with respect to a splitting h = h1  h2

a : h1  h1,

b : h1  h2,
let the inverse be split similarly:

b : h2  h1,

d : h2  h2.

(191)

then,

x1 = 


 






 .

a + b = 0,

b + d = 0

60

(192)

(193)

and

a + b = 1,

b + d = 1.

solving the rst pair of equations we get two expressions for :

 ba1 =  = d1b.

(194)

(195)

putting either of these into the equation for  gives two expressions for it:

a1 + a1bba1 =  = [a  bd1b]1.

similarly,

d1 + d1bbd1 =  = [d  ba1b]1

by combining the two ways of writing  and  we get

 = a1 + a1b[d  ba1b]1ba1,

 = d1 + d1b[a  bd1b]1bd1.

these identities will be used in the text.
