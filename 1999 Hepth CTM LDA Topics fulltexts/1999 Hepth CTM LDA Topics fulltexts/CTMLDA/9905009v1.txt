abstract

the atiyah-drinfeld-hitchin-manin matrix corresponding to a tetrahedrally sym-
metric 3-instanton is calculated. some small variations of the matrix correspond to
vibrations of the instanton-generated 3-skyrmion. these vibrations are decomposed
under tetrahedral symmetry and this decomposition is compared to previous knowl-
edge of the 3-skyrmion vibration spectrum.

1 introduction

in the skyrme model, the classical b-nucleon nucleus is a b-skyrmion: a minimum
energy skyrme eld with topological charge b.
in the instanton construction, skyrme
elds are derived from instanton elds by calculating the holonomy of the instanton elds
in the x4 direction [1]. there is a (8b 1)-dimensional family of baryon number b skyrme
elds derived from the space of b-instantons. it is believed that the b-skyrmion is well
approximated by an instanton-generated skyrme eld. this is certainly the case when b
is one, two, three or four [1, 2].

the 3-skyrmion has tetrahedral symmetry [3]. in [2], the jackiw-nohl-rebbi (jnr)
ansatz is used to derive a tetrahedral 3-instanton. from this, the instanton-generated 3-
skyrmion is calculated. in [4], walet examines vibration modes of the instanton-generated
3-skyrmion by varying the jnr parameters. although a large class of instantons can be
constructed using the jnr ansatz, it is not general. however, the atiyah-drinfeld-hitchin-
manin (adhm) construction is complete and, in this paper, the tetrahedral 3-instanton
adhm matrix is calculated. the instanton-generated 3-skyrmion vibration modes are
then examined by varying the adhm parameters. the vibration frequencies are not

calculated. however, the vibrations are decomposed under the action of the tetrahedral
symmetry. this allows the decomposition to be compared to other calculations of 3-
skyrmion vibrations.

2 the tetrahedrally symmetric adhm matrix

symmetric adhm matrices have been discussed in a recent paper by singer and
sutclie [5] and this should be consulted for the many details not included in this section.

the adhm matrix for a b-instanton is a quaternionic matrix

m = (cid:18) l

m (cid:19)

(1)

where l is a b-vector and m is a symmetric b  b matrix. m must satisfy the adhm
constraint
(2)

m m is real.

dagger denotes quaternionic conjugation and transposition. identifying pure quaternions
with su2, the instanton gauge elds are

where n(x) is the unit length (b + 1)-vector solving

a(x) = n (x)n(x)

n (x)(cid:18)

l

m  x1b (cid:19) = 0

where x = x4 + x1i + x2j + x3k.

there is an ambiguity in choosing n(x) given by

n(x)  n(x)g(x)

(3)

(4)

(5)

where g(x) is a unit quaternion, this corresponds to gauge transformation of the elds.
there is also an ambiguity in m given by

m  (cid:18) g 0

0 s (cid:19) ms1

(6)

where g is a unit quaternion and s is a real orthogonal b  b matrix.
under the conjugate action of unit quaternions on x, the real part of x is xed and the
imaginary part transforms under the three-dimensional representation of so3. as explained
in [5], an instanton has the spatial rotation symmetry x  gxg1 for unit quaternion g if

(cid:18)

l

m  gxg11b (cid:19) = (cid:18) g

0 s  g (cid:19)(cid:18)

l

m  x1b (cid:19) g1  s1

where g is a unit quaternion and s  g is the product of a real orthogonal matrix and the
unit quaternion g.

the matrix

mt (cid:19) =

is invariant under the tetrahedral group generated by a rotation of  about the x3-axis and
a rotation of 2/3 about x1 = x2 = x3. these generators will be called r and t respectively.
explicitly, g(r) = k with

and g(r) = g(r). g(t) = (1  i  j  k)/2 with

(t) =

(9)

(10)

and g(t) = g(t).

mt is not unique, there is a two-parameter family of tetrahedral matrices given by
x( mt + y14). y can be set to zero. it corresponds to translation of the instanton in the x4
direction and this does not change the corresponding skyrme eld. x is a scale parameter
and, when calculating the instanton-generated skyrmion, the scale is xed by minimization
of the skyrme energy. there can be no more than two parameters because, as explained
in [5], it follows from (7) that

mt : 3|t  (3  2  2)|t

(11)

where n is the n-dimensional representation of su2 and, in the equation, these representa-
tions are restricted to the tetrahedral group t  so3. in the notation used, for example,
by hammermesh [6]
(12)

mt : f  3f + a2 + a3

and so there is a three-parameter family of candidate mt matrices. this is exhausted by

(13)

similarly,

(14)
and, since (3  2)|t = e + g, there is a one-parameter family of lt . the symmetry of
mt and the adhm constraint (2) reduce these four parameters to the two parameters x

lt : (3  2)|t  2|t = e.

and y above. there is another two-parameter family of symmetric matrices corresponding
to the dual tetrahedron, this is given by replacing mt in mt by mt .
t by the s4 element u

mt is not just symmetric under t but also under the 24 element group td which extends

u : (x1, x2, x3, x4)  (x2, x1,x3,x4).

3 variations

small variations around mt are now considered. writing

m = mt + m

m satises the linearized adhm constraint

if

the linearized equations are

im( m mt + m 

t m) = 0.

m =

l2

l1
l3
m11 m12 m13
m12 m22 m23
m13 m23 m33







im(l1j + m11k + m13i  il2  km22  jm23) = 0,
im(l1k + m11j + m12i  il3  km23  jm33) = 0,
im(l2k + m22i + m12j  jl3  km13  im33) = 0

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

where bar denotes quaternionic conjugation. these equations can be solved to give expres-
sions for nine of the twelve li parameters. the remaining three components correspond to
the gauge transformation

mt  (cid:18) g

0 13 (cid:19) mt .

0

(22)

this gauge freedom can be xed by requiring, for example, that l1 is proportional to i. in
this way, l may be completely determined by m and by gauge xing.

4

in order to decompose the 24 mij component as representations of td, the actions of r,

t and u on mt are considered. thus, for example,

(r)g(r)mg(r)1(r)1 = 


km11k km12k
km12k km22k
km13k

km13k
km23k
km23k km33k




(23)

and so the character of r is zero. the characters of t and u can be calculated in the same
way: they are also zero. this means that the decomposition of the mij is

a1 + a2 + 2e + 3f1 + 3f2.

(24)

not all of these multiplets correspond to skyrmion vibrations. there remains the gauge

freedom

mt  smt s1.

(25)

by considering an innitesimal s and calculating the character, it is found that this vari-
ation is an f1. the remaining 21 variations correspond to the 21 dimensions of the space
of 3-instantons. however, the variation corresponding to time translation, a2, is irrelevant
to the 3-skyrmion and is discarded. twenty variational modes remain: six of these cor-
respond to zero modes. in fact, the translation and rotation zero modes of the skyrmion
correspond to an f2 and an f1 respectively. thus, the instanton modes of the 3-skyrmion
decompose as

a1 + 2e + 2f1 + 3f2

(26)

under td and, of these, one f1 and one f2 are zero modes and the rest are vibrational
modes. the isospin zero modes are not included in this decomposition because they do
not correspond to variations of the adhm matrix.

4 discussion

the a1 is the breather mode corresponding to dilation. in the numerical results of
barnes, baskerville and turok [7], it appears in the middle of the vibration spectrum. in
order of increasing frequency and ignoring radiation, barnes, baskerville and turok nd
the spectrum to be f2 + e + a1 + f2 + e.

the e + f2 below the breather are the modes described in [8] as monopole modes.
they correspond to variations of the rational map parameters in the rational map ansatz
of [8].

the e + f2 above the breather are discussed in [9] by baskerville and michaels.

it
has been observed that, to a good approximation, there are 2b  2 straight lines of zero
baryon density, known as branch lines, radiating from the centre of a b-skyrmion. in [9],
the variations of the angular positions of the branch lines are parameterized. these are
then decomposed. it is noted that if an axial vector is removed from this decomposition, the
decomposition then matches the super-breather modes in the 2-skyrmion and 3-skyrmion

spectra. in the 4-skyrmion case the decomposition is consistent with the observed spec-
trum. baskerville and michaels interprete the axial vector which must be removed as the
axial vector of rotational zero modes.

some of the monopole modes also change the branch line positions. therefore, [9]
implies that the super-breather mode decomposition duplicates part of the decomposition
of the monopole modes. there are, in total, 4b + 2 monopole modes of a b-skyrmion.
six of them do not change the branch lines: of these, three are the isospin zero modes.
because the parameters in the rational map are complex, the monopole modes come in
pairs of opposite parity. there are three monopole modes which compose pairs with isospin
modes in this way. these are the other three modes which do not change the positions
of branch lines. the remaining 4b  4 modes change the positions of the branch lines.
these 4b  4 modes include the three translational and three rotational zero modes along
with 4b  10 vibrational modes. thus, there are 4b  7 monopole modes which are not
rotational zero modes and which change the positions of the branch lines. it is possible
to reformulate the observation made in [9]: the decomposition of these 4b  7 modes
duplicates the decomposition of the super-breather modes.
thus, an exception is made for the rotational zero modes, the translational zero modes
are duplicated but the rotational zero modes are not.
in fact, in the b = 3 case, the
instanton modes contain a f1 duplicating the rotational zero modes. this f1 has not been
observed numerically. the reason for this may be that the f1 mode has a rather high
frequency.

for b = 3, the monopole modes which x the branch line positions are an f1 of isospin
and an f2 vibration. the monopole modes which change the branch line positions are the
rotational and translational zero modes f1 + f2 and the multiplet of vibration modes e.
thus, the e in the super-breather part of the 3-skyrmion spectrum duplicates the e in
the monopole part. the f2 duplicates the translational zero modes. if a duplicate is also
included for the rotational zero modes; then the aggregate of the breather, the monopole
modes and their duplicates matches the instanton mode decomposition (26).

because walet uses jnr ansatz instantons, not all of the instanton modes are included
in the harmonic analysis of [4]. to be precise, there is only one e, whereas the adhm
construction gives two. in the case of the rational map decomposition, it is known that
the e is spanned by tangent vectors lying along the s4 symmetric geodesics. these are
referred to in [10] as twisted line scattering geodesics.

there is a three-dimensional family of adhm matrices, symmetric under the d2d gen-

erated by u and  rotations about the cartesian axes. they are

md2d =

ai aj
bk
e
ck
dj
ck e di
0
dj

di







with, from the adhm constraint,

ab + de  dc = 0

(28)

d2  a2 + 2ec = 0.

for a = b = c = d = x and e = 0 this is mt and for a = c = d = e = 0 it is
axially symmetric about the x3-axis. it is interesting to note that this space of matrices
shares the curious feature of the th matrices in [5]. that is, the one-dimensional family
which results from xing the scale and setting the real part to zero does not include well-
separated instantons of equal scale. more complicated subfamilies, including well-separated
instantons of equal scale, may be chosen by using arguments similar to those in [5]. one
simple example, with b = 1 xing the scale, is

e =

c(c2  1)
2(c4 + 1)

.

(29)

of course, this is just one path which passes though the various features associated with
twisted line scattering. the innitesimal behaviour around mt does not give the splitting
of the 2e into a sub-breather e and the super-breather e. it is not known how to make
this split, without calculating the holonomy and performing the full harmonic analysis as
walet did for jnr ansatz instanton-generated 3-skyrmions.

in conclusion, the instanton modes of the 3-skyrmion have been calculated and de-
composed. the decomposition ts well with other similar decompositions. the primary
question provoked by the calculations is whether it is possible to split the modes further
without undertaking the harmonic analysis.
