abstract

we study the ultraviolet asymptotics in ane toda theories. these models are con-
sidered as perturbed non-ane toda theories. we calculate the reection amplitudes,
which relate dierent exponential elds with the same quantum numbers. using these
amplitudes we derive the quantization condition for the vacuum wave function, describing
zero-mode dynamics, and calculate the uv asymptotics of the eective central charge.
these asymptotics are in a good agreement with thermodynamic bethe ansatz results.

1 introduction

there is a large class of 2d quantum eld theories (qfts) which can be considered as
perturbed conformal eld theories (cfts) [1]. these theories are completely dened if
one species its cft data and the relevant operator which plays the role of perturbation.
the cft data contain explicit information about ultraviolet (uv) asymptotics of the
eld theory while its long distance property is the subject of analysis.
if a perturbed
cft contains only massive particles, it is equivalent to the relativistic scattering theory
and is completely dened by specifying the s-matrix. contrary to cft data the s-matrix
data exibit some information about long distance properties of the theory in an explicit
way, while the uv asymptotics have to be derived.

a link between these two kinds of data would provide a good view point for un-
derstanding the general structure of 2d qfts.
in general this problem does not look
tractable. whereas the cft data can be specied in a relatively simple way, the general
s-matrix is very complicated object even in 2d. however, there exists an important class
of 2d qfts (integrable theories) where scattering theory is factorized and s-matrix can
be described in great details.

in this case one can apply the nonperturbative methods based on the s-matrix data.
one of these methods is thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba) [2, 3]. it gives the possibility
to calculate the ground state energy e(r) (or eective central charge ce(r)) for the
system on the circle of size r. at small r the uv asymptotics of ce(r) can be compared
with that following from the cft data.

usually the uv asymptotics for the eective central charge can be derived from the
conformal perturbation theory. in this case the corrections to ce(0) = ccft have a form
of series in r where  is dened by the dimension of perturbing operator. however, there
is an important class of qfts where the uv asymptotics of ce(r) is mainly determined
by the zero-mode dynamics (see for example [4, 5, 6, 7]). in this case the uv corrections
to ccft have the form of series in inverse powers of log(1/r). this uv expansion is also
encoded in cft data [6].

the simplest integrable qft with the logarithmic expansion for the eective central
charge is the sinh-gordon (shg) model, which is an integrable deformation of liouville
conformal eld theory (lft). it was shown in paper [6] that the crucial role in the descrip-
tion of the zero-mode dynamics in the shg model is played by the reection amplitude
of the lft, which determine the asymptotics of the ground state wave function in this
theory.
(the reection amplitudes in cft dene the linear transformations between
dierent exponential elds, corresponding to the same primary eld of chiral algebra.)
the perturbative term in the shg model restricts the dynamics to the interval of size
l  log(1/r), which leads to the quantization condition for the momentum p conjugated
to the zero-mode. the solution p (r) of the quantization condition determines all loga-
rithmic terms in the uv asymptotics of the eective central charge ce(r). the similar
approach was used in [7] to describe the uv asymptotics of bullough-dodd and super-
symmetric shg models. in all cases it was found perfect agreement with tba results
based on the s-matrix data.

in this paper we study the uv behaviour of the eective central charge in ane toda
eld theories (atfts) associated with simply-laced lie algebras g = ade. the number

2

of particles in the atft is equal to the rank r of g. for r >> 1 the numerical analysis of
the tba equations, especially in the uv region, becomes very complicated. the analytical
consideration of the tba equations permits to calculate only the rst term (o(1/l2)) in
the uv expansion for ce(r) which also contains undetermined constants [8, 9]. so it is
useful to have the full logarithmic expansion for this function with explicitly determined
coecients from the cft data.

in the next section we describe the scattering theory and give the exact relations
between the parameters of the action and spectrum of the atft. this qft can be
considered as perturbed cft, namely, perturbed non-ane toda theory (natt), which
possesses nontrivial chiral algebra (w (g)-algebra). we derive the reection amplitudes
for this cft. in the weak coupling limit these amplitudes reduce to the coecients in
the asymptotics of the wave function of the one-dimensional open quantum toda chain
(see for example [10]). this system describes the semiclassical limit of the zero-mode
dynamics of the natt. the relation between the reection amplitudes and the vacuum
wave function of the natt is studied in sect.3.
in sect.4 we derive the quantization
condition and calculate the uv asymptotics for the eective central charge for the atft.
in sect.5 we compare this asymptotics with numerical data. an independent derivation
of quantization condition for one-dimensional quantum toda chain is given in appendix.

the atfts corresponding to lie algebra g is described by the action

where ei, i = 1, . . . , r are the simple roots of the lie algebra g of rank r and e0 is a
maximal root satisfying

the elds in eq.(1) are normalized so that at  = 0

ha(x)b(y)i = ab log |x  y|2.

we will consider later the case of simply-laced lie algebras g = a, d, e.

for real b the spectrum of these atfts consists of r particles with the masses mi

the relation between the parameter m characterizing the spectrum of physical particles
and parameter  in the action (1) can be obtained by bethe ansatz method (see for
example [11, 12]). it can be easily derived from the results of [12] and has the form:

 (1 + b2) =

mk(g)(cid:16)

where (x) = (x)/(1  x) and

with ni dened in eq.(2).

for the practical applications it is useful to have the relations between the parameter

m and the minimal masses m1 in a, e and masses mn = mn1 in dn atfts:

an1 : m2
e6 : m2
1 = 83 sin(/5) sin(/30)m2.

1 = 4 sin2(/n)m2,
1 = (3  3)m2,

e8 : m2

dn : m2
e7 : m2

n1 = m2 = 2m2,

n = m2
1 = 8 sin2(/9)m2,

the scattering matrix for the particles mi in atft was constructed in [13, 14]. it

depends on one parameter

b =

b2

1 + b2

(10)

and is invariant under duality transformation b  1/b or b  1  b. this scattering
matrix is a pure phase (see, for example, [15, 9]):

the atfts can be considered as perturbed cfts. without the last term with the
zeroth root e0, the action in eq.(1) describes the natt, which is conformal. to describe
the generator of conformal symmetry we introduce the complex coordinates z = x1 + ix2
and z = x1  ix2 and vector

ensures the local conformal invariance of the natt with the central charge

c = r + 12q2 = r(cid:16)1 + h(h + 1)q2(cid:17) .

(14)

besides the conformal invariance the natt possesses extended symmetry generated
by w (g)-algebra. the full chiral w (g)-algebra contains r holomorphic elds wj(z)
(w2(z) = t (z)) with spins j which follows the exponents of lie algebra g. the explicit
representation of these elds in terms of elds z can be found in [16]. the primary
elds w of w (g) algebra are classied by r eigenvalues wj, j = 1, . . . , r of the operator
wj,0 (the zeroth fourier component of the current wj(z)):

wj,0w = wjw,

wj,nw = 0, n > 0.

the exponential elds

va(x) = e(q+a)(x)
are spinless conformal primary elds with dimensions

(a) = w2(a) =

q2
2

a

.

(15)

(16)

(17)

the elds in eq.(16) are also primary elds with respect to all chiral algebra w (g) with
the eigenvalues wj depending on a. the functions wj(a) which dene the representation
of w (g)-algebra possess the symmetry with respect to the weyl group w of lie algebra
g [16], i.e.
(18)
it means that the elds vsa for dierent s  w are reection images of each other and
are related by the linear transformation:

wj(sa) = wj(a);

s  w.

where rs(a) is the reection amplitude.

va(x) = rs(a)vsa(x)

(19)

this function is an important object in cft and plays a crucial role in the calcula-
tion of one-point functions in perturbed cft [17]. to calculate the function rs(a), we
introduce the elds w:

w(x) = n 1(a)va(x)

(20)

(21)

(22)

where normalization factor n(a) is chosen in the way that eld w satises the conformal
normalization condition

the normalized elds w are invariant under reection transformations and hence;

hw(x)w(y)i =

1

|x  y|4 .

rs(a) =

n(a)
n(sa)

.

for the calculation of the normalization factor n(a), we can use the integral representation
for the correlation functions of the w (g)-invariant cft. (see [16] for details.) we note

that operators bqi dened as

bqi = z d2xebei(x)

5

(23)

commute with all of the elements of w (g)-algebra and can be used as screening operators
for the calculation of the correlation functions in the natt. if parameters a satisfy the
condition

2q + 2a +

kiei = 0

(24)

rxi=1

with non-negative integer ki, we obtain form eqs.(20) and (21) the following expression
for the function n(a) in terms of coulomb integrals [16]:

n 2(a) = |x|4*va(x)va(0)

i

ki!+
ryi=1 bqki

(25)

where the expectation value in eq.(25) is taken over the fock vacuum of massless elds
 with the correlation functions (3).

the normalization integral can be calculated and the result has the form:

n 2(a) =(cid:16)(b2)(cid:17)2(q+a)/b y>0

(1 + q/b)(1 + qb)(1 + a/b)(1 + ab)
(1  q/b)(1  qb)(1  a/b)(1  ab)

(26)

in terms of the scalar products

q = q  ,

a = a  

(27)

where the product runs over all positive roots of lie algebra g.

we accept eq.(26) as the proper analytical continuation of the function n 2(a) for all

a. it gives us the following expression for the reection amplitude rs(a):

rs(a) =

n(a)
n(sa)

=

asa
aa

where

aa =(cid:16)(b2)(cid:17)a/b y>0

(1  a/b)(1  ab).

the reection relation eq.(19) can be written in more symmetric form as:

aava(x) = asavsa(x),

s  w.

(28)

(29)

(30)

in following we will be interested in the values of functions aa for imaginary a = ip. we
denote as v (p, x) = vip(x) and

a(p) = aip =(cid:16)(b2)(cid:17)ip/b y>0

(1  ip/b)(1  ipb).

(31)

using these objects we can construct the combination which is invariant under the weyl
reections:

p = xsw

a(sp)v (sp).

3 reections of quantum mechanical waves

in this section we follow the lft analysis [6] to interpret the relation between the primary
elds of the natts and the wave functionals [(x)] whose asymptotic behaviours are
described by the wave functions of the zero-modes. the zero-modes of the elds (x) are
dened as:

0 =z 2

0

dx1
2

(x)

.

(33)

here we consider the natt on an innite plane cylinder of circumference 2 with coor-
dinate x2 along the cylinder playing the role of imaginary time. in the asymptotic region
where the potential terms in the natt action become negligible (ei  0   for all
i), the elds can be expanded in terms of free eld operators an

(x) = 0  p(z  z) +xn6=0(cid:18)ian
in this region any state of the
where p = i0 is the conjugate momentum of 0.
natt can be decomposed into a direct product of two parts, namely, a wave function of
the zero-modes and a state in fock space generated by the operators an. in particular,
the wave functional corresponding to the primary state eq.(32) can be expressed as a
direct product of a wave function of the zero-modes 0 and fock vacuum:

einz(cid:19) ,

ian
n

einz +

(34)

n

p[(x)]  p(0)  |0i

(35)

where the wave function p(0) in this asymptotic region is a superposition of plane
waves with momenta sp.

the reection amplitudes of the natt dened in the previous section can be inter-
preted as those for the wave function of the zero-modes in the presence of potential walls.
this can be understood most clearly in the semiclassical limit b  0 where one can ne-
glect the operators an in eq.(34) even for signicant values of the parameter . the full
quantum eect can be implemented simply by introducing the exact reection amplitudes
which take into account also non-zero-mode contributions [6]. the resulting schrodinger
equation is given by

rxi=1

ebei0# p(0) = e0p(0)

with the ground state energy

e0 =

+ p2.

(36)

(37)

here the momentum p is any continuous real vector. the eective central charge can
be obtained from eq.(37) where p2 takes the minimal possible value for the perturbed
theory. since only asymptotic form of the wave function matters, we derive the reection
amplitudes of the atfts in the way that we need only the lft result.

in the   0 limit which will be of our interest, the potential vanishes almost ev-
erywhere except for the values of 0 where some of exponential terms in the potential
become large enough to overcome the small value of . in this case, each exponential

7

term ebei0 in the interaction represent a wall with ei being its normal vector. if we con-
sider the behaviour of a wave function near a wall normal to ei where the eect of other
interaction terms becomes negligible, the problem becomes equivalent to the lft in the
ei direction. the potential becomes at in the (r  1)-dimensional orthogonal directions.
the asymptotic form of the energy eigenfunction is then given by the product of that of
liouville wave function and (r  1)-dimensional plane wave,
  heipi0i + sl(pi)eipi0ii eip0

(38)

 eip0 + sl(pi)eisip0 ,

where si denotes the weyl reection by the simple root ei and pi the component of p
along ei direction. sl(p ) is the reection amplitude of the lft,

sl(p ) =(cid:16)(b2)(cid:17)ip/b  (1 + ip b)  (1 + ip/b)
 (1  ip b)  (1  ip/b)

.

(39)

since the wave function interpretation makes sense only in the semiclassical limit, it is
the b  0 limit of eq.(39) which can be obtained from the solution of the schrodinger
equation for the lft.
we can see from eq.(38) that the momentum of the reected wave by the i-th wall
is given by the weyl reection si acting on the incoming momentum.
if we consider
the reections from all the potential walls, the wave function in the asymptotic region
is a superposition of the plane waves reected by potential walls in dierent ways. the
momenta of these waves form the orbit of the weyl group w of the lie algebra g;

p(0)  xsw

a(sp)eisp0.

(40)

this is indeed the wave function representation of the primary eld (32) in the asymptotic
region.

it follows from eq.(38) that the amplitudes a(p) satisfy the relations

a(sip)
a(p)

= sl(pi).

(41)

for a general weyl element s which can be represented by a product of the weyl elements
si associated with the simple roots by s = sik sik1    si1, the above equation can be
generalized to
a(sik    si1p)

= sl(p  ei1)sl(si1p  ei2)sl(si2 si1p  ei3)    sl(sik1    si1p  eik). (42)
using the properties of the weyl group (see for example [18]) and the explicit form of the
amplitude sl(p ), it is straightforward to verify that the following function a(p) satises
eqs.(41) and (42):

a(p)

a(p) =(cid:16)(b2)(cid:17)ip/b y>0

 (1  ipb)  (1  ip/b)

(43)

where p =   p is a scalar product with a positive root . the fact that eq.(43) is
similar to (31) illustrates the relation between the primary elds and zero modes wave
functions in natt.

4 quantization condition and scaling function for

atft

the analysis of the previous section can be used to obtain the scaling functions in the deep
uv region of the atfts dened on a cylinder with circumference r  0. the additional
potential term in the atft lagrangian corresponding to the zeroth root e0 introduces
new potential wall in that direction (see fig.1 as a simplest example, the a2 atft). with
this addition, the region of 0 made of the non-ane toda potential walls (weyl chamber)
is now closed and the momentum of the wave function should be quantized depending on
the size of the enclosed region. this quantized momentum denes the scaling function
ce in the uv region by eq.(37).

the quantization condition can be derived using the arguments of sect.3. for the
moment we assume that the circumference of the cylinder is 2. consider the path c of
a wave which starts with momentum p and comes back (after a series of reections by
other walls) to the zeroth potential wall with momentum p. it will then be reected by
the zeroth wall. fig.1(b) illustrates a multiple reection in the two-dimensional potential.
to satisfy the self-consistency condition, the momentum p after the last reection by the
zeroth wall should be equal to the incoming momentum p so that s0p = p. furthermore,
since the zeroth wall is again liouville-type, the momenta p = s0p of the incident wave

9

and p of the reected wave should satisfy eq.(41) which leads to

a(s0p)
a(p)

= sl(p  e0).

(44)

on the other hand, since s0 is given by a product of the weyl reections corresponding
to simple roots, each representing the reection experienced by the wave along the path
c, the left hand side of eq.(44) can be obtained from eq.(43). therefore, eq.(44) gives a
nontrivial quantization condition for the momentum p. this condition can be generalized
using the same arguments for other potential walls instead of the zeroth one. then we
obtain

a(s0sp)
a(sp)

= sl(sp  e0) .

(45)

where s is an arbitrary weyl group element.

using eq.(43) we can write (45)

(cid:16)(b2)(cid:17)ipsv/b"y>0

g(sp  s0)

g(sp  ) # g(sp  e0)

g(sp  e0)

= 1 ,

(46)

where

and we dene a function

v = s0   + e0 = (e0  )e0 + e0 = he0

g(p ) =  (1  ip/b)  (1  ip b) .

the -function factors in eq.(46) can be further simplied. first, consider the action of
s0 on a positive root : s0 =   e0(e0  ), which is either  or  + e0 if  6= e0
since e0 is the maximal root.
in the rst case, the factor g(sp  s0) in eq.(46) is
cancelled out by the same factor in the denominator, while, in the second case, there is
no cancellation since  + e0 is a negative root. finally, s0e0 = e0 and the corresponding
factor g(sp  e0) appears twice in eq.(45). using the property e0   = 0 or 1 for  > 0
( 6= e0) and e0  e0 = 2, we can simplify eq.(46) as

(cid:16)(b2)(cid:17)ihpse0/b y>0"g(p  s)

g(p  s) #sse0

= 1 .

(47)

since the weyl element s is arbitrary, eq.(47) leads to the following condition for the

lowest energy state

(49)

this is the quantization condition for the momentum p in the   0 limit. we see that
eectively each positive root  causes a phase shift of liouville type.
now we consider the system dened on a cylinder with the circumference r. when

we scale back the size from r to 2, the parameter  in the action (1) changes to

  (cid:18) r

2(cid:19)2(1+b2)

.

(50)

the   0 limit is realized as the deep uv limit r  0. the rescaling changes the
denition of l in eq.(48) by

(52)

where p satises eq.(48).

in this limit, eq.(48) can be solved perturbatively. for this we expand the function

(p ) in eq.(49) in powers of p ,

where

(p ) = 1(b)p + 3(b)p 3 + 5(b)p 5    ,

1(b) = 2qe ,

using the relation (7) between the parameter  in the action and the parameter m char-
acterizing the spectrum, we can represent the eective central charge (56) for the simply-
laced atfts in terms of dimensionless value mr. in this form it can be compared with
tba results.

we note that expansion (56,57) for dn atfts can be continued to the half-integer
n. the dn toda theories with half-integer n = l + 1/2 were studied in [19]. besides
the bosonic elds  these models include the majorana fermion . the corresponding
scattering theory is also self-dual (b  1/b). to obtain the values of ce(r) for these
models we should express ce(r) in terms of parameter mr where m is dened by eq.(9)
and take the continuation for r = n, h = 2(n  1), and k(dn) = 2
2(n1) to the half-
integer n = l + 1/2. in particular, for n = 3/2 we obtain exactly the expansion for the
supersymmetric shg model found in [7].

example: a2 atft

as a simplest example, we consider the a2 atft more explicitly. in this case, there
are two simple roots e1 and e2, and the ane root e0 is given by e0 = (e1 + e2). for
each simple root, a liouville-type potential wall is placed in the normal direction and the
walls form a regular triangle as shown in fig.1.

as the coecient   0, the size of the triangle becomes large and the zero-mode
dynamics reduces to the quantum mechanical problem in two dimensions surrounded
by a triangular potential wall where the potential vanishes except the vicinity of the
walls. the energy eigenstate of the system is then the standing wave in the trian-
gle which is a superposition of plane waves with momenta reected by walls as ex-
plained in sect.3. since the weyl group w of a2 algebra consists from six elements,
w = {1, s1, s2, s1s2, s2s1, s1s2s1 = s2s1s2 = s0}, the wave function can be written as a

12

sum of six plane waves generated by the weyl reections as in eq.(40) with their coef-
cients determined by liouville reection amplitudes. for example, if one considers the
path c of fig.1 followed by a wave with momentum p, one nds

a(s1p) = sl(p  e1)a(p) ,

a(s2s1p) = sl(s1p  e2)a(s1p) = sl(s1p  e2)sl(p  e1)a(p) ,
a(s1s2s1p) = sl(s2s1p  e1)a(s2s1p) = sl(s2s1p  e1)sl(s1p  e2)sl(p  e1)a(p) ,
which can be summarized as eq.(43).

if the wave is further reected by the zeroth wall, we have

a(s0s1s2s1p) = sl(s1s2s1p  e0)a(s1s2s1p)

= sl(s1s2s1p  e0)sl(s2s1p  e1)sl(s1p  e2)sl(p  e1)a(p) . (58)
since s0 = s1s2s1, eq.(58) gives a quantization condition for p which is the special case
of eq.(46). simplifying the arguments of sl in eq.(58), we nd

sl(p  e1)sl(p  e2)sl(p  (e1 + e2))2 = 1 ,

which is equivalent to eq.(47).

5 comparison with the tba results

a standard approach to study the scaling behaviour of integrable qfts is to solve the
tba equations. in this section we compute the scaling functions of the atfts in the
uv region from the tba equations and compare them with the results in eq.(56) based
on the reection amplitudes.

the tba equations for the atfts are given by (i = 1,   , r)

mir cosh  = i(, r) +

rxj=1z ij(  ) log(cid:16)1 + ei()(cid:17) d

2

,

(59)

where ij is the kernel which is equal to the logarithmic derivative of the s-matrix sij()
in eq.(11)

ij() = i

d
d

log sij() = 

ij().

these are r-coupled nonlinear integral equations for the pseudo-energies i(, r) which
give the scaling function of the eective central charge

ce(r) =

3rmi

2

rxi=1

z cosh  log(cid:16)1 + ei()(cid:17) d.

(60)

it is quite dicult task to solve the tba equations analytically and compare directly
with eq.(56). to obtain higher order terms in 1/l expansion, one needs to solve compli-
cated coupled nonlinear dierential equations. even the lowest order terms at the order
of 1/l2 contain constants which can not be decided by the scattering data. while the

method used in [7] may be applicable here, we will concentrate only on numerical analysis
of the tba equations to avoid any digression to dierent problem.

even the numerical analysis is limited if the rank r grows since a large number of
equations amplify the numerical errors entering in the iteration procedure. therefore we
will consider a few atfts with low ranks in each series of a-d-e, namely, a2, a3, a4,
d4 and e6 atfts. the eective central charge ce(r) is computed by solving eq.(60)
iteratively as a function of mr. in order to compare the numerical data with our results
based on the reection amplitudes, we t the numerical data for ce(r) from the tba
equations for many dierent values of r with the function (56) where 1, 3 and 5
are considered as the tting parameters. for this comparison the relation (7) between
the parameter  in the action and parameter m for the particle masses is used. these
parameters is are then compared with eq.(54) dened from the reection amplitude
of the lft. since we already separate out the dependence on the lie algebra g, our
numerical results for the parameters is should be independent of g.

tables 13 show the values of parameters is obtained numerically from tba equa-
tions for dierent values of the coupling constant b in a2, a3, a4, d4 and e6 atfts.
we see that they are in excellent agreement with those values of is following from the
reection amplitudes supplemented with eq.(7). thus numerical tba analysis fully sup-
ports the validity of our whole scheme based on the reection amplitude, -m relation
and the quantization condition on p.

the agreement is relatively poor for 5 for the cases with high rank such as e6 partly

due to the numerical errors in higher order calculations. another reason comes from
the fact that neglected terms in the 1/l expansion (the order of o(1/l8) or higher) in
eq.(56) may not be suciently small compared with terms with 5. however, one can
in principle reduce these errors by increasing the accuracy of the numerical calculations.
there are also corrections of o(r) to the expansion of ce(r) in power series of 1/l which
increase as b goes to zero. this explains why the discrepancies in the tables increase as
b decreases.

in fig.2, we also plot the scaling functions ce(r) as a function of r setting m = 1/2
for dierent atfts; rst, using numerical solutions of the tba equations and, second,
using eqs.(48) and (52) based on the reection amplitudes. to compare the same objects,
we added to the second case the contribution from the bulk vacuum energy term [20, 12]

6 concluding remarks

in the main part of this paper we considered the uv asymptotics of the ground state
energy in atfts. the main objects which were used for this analysis were the reection
amplitudes (28) of natts. as it was mentioned in sect. 2 these objects also play a
crucial role in the calculation of the one poin functions in perturbed cft. the one point
functions of the exponential elds

g(a) = hexp a  i

in atfts can be reconstructed from the reection amplitudes (28). it followes from the
results of the paper [17] that these functions satisfy to the functonal equations similar to
the relations (19, 30). for the ade series of atfts these functions were calculated in
[23] and have the form:

mk(g)(cid:16)

(1+b2)h(cid:17) (cid:16)1 + b2

h(1+b2)(cid:17)

where k(g). a, q are dened by eqs. (8), (27) and

(t) = 

sinh((1 + b2)t)

sinh t sinh(b2t) sinh((1 + b2)ht)

we suppose to discuss the application of these functions to the analysis of atfts and

related perturbed cft in another publication.

in the previous sections we studied the uv asymptotics for the simply laced atfts.
it looks interesting to extend this consideration to the case of dual pairs of non simply
lased atfts. to do this it is necessary to generalize the quantization condition (48) and
the relations (7) between the parameters of the action and masses of the particles. the
work in this direction is in progress.

appendix: an1 quantum toda chain

in this appendix we obtain the quantization conditions for one-dimensional an1 quantum
toda chain using the approach based on the integrability of this theory. the quantum
toda chain corresponds to the semiclassical (b  0) approach to the zero-mode dynamics
of the atft, however, the structure of quantization condition for this system is similar
to eq.(48).

the quantum toda chain is described by the hamiltonian

h =

1
2

nxi=1

p2
i + 2

nxi=1

eb(qiqi+1)

(62)

where qn+1  q1. the model (62) is integrable. the diagonalization of the hamiltonian
was done in a remarkable paper by sklyanin [21] who used the quantum inverse scattering
method to obtain the bethe ansatz (ba) equations for the eigenvalues of h. here we show
that for  << 1 these ba equations can be represented in the form similar to eq.(48).

the lax operator for toda chain (62) has the form

li(u) =  u  pi ebqi

ebqi

0

! .

(63)

the commuting family of the transfer matrices t (u) corresponding to the lax operator
eq.(63) can be written as:

t (u) = tr (l1(u) . . . ln(u)) ,

[t (u), t (u)] = 0.

the operators t (u) is a polynomial of degree n with the coecients:

t (u) = un + t1un1 + t2un2 + . . .

(64)

(65)

where t1 = pn

i=1 pi = p and t2 = h + p 2/2. the ba equations for the eigenvalues
t(u) of the operator t (u) can be formulated in terms of eigenvalues q(u) of baxters
q-operator [22]. namely, these equations have the form [21]

t(u)q(u) = n(cid:16)inq(u + ib) + inq(u  ib)(cid:17)

where t(u) is a polynomial of u, which can be written as

t(u) =

nyi=1

(u  vi), with p =

vi, e =

nxi=1

v2
i /2,

nxi=1

(66)

(67)

and q(u) is an entire function of u.

with these two conditions eq.(66) is rather complicated to be solved analytically.
even for n = 2 it can be only reduced to the mathieu equation. here we consider the
approximate solution of eq.(66) with accuracy o(n). namely, we impose the condition
that function q(u) is a meromorphic function with the absolute values of residues at the
poles o(n).

18

the function q(u) with this analyticity property which satises to eq.(66) with accu-

! nyi=1

racy o(n) can be written in the form
 i(vi  u)
q(u) = exp  iun log 
the function q(u) has the poles at real u = vi with the residues o(1) and the poles in
the complex plane with the residues o(n). to satisfy the analyticity condition we should
cancel the poles at u = vj. in this way we arrive at the following equations for parameters
vj:

 i(u  vi)

the minimal set of numbers ij corresponding to the ground state with center of mass

momentum p = 0 can be written as:

ij = 2j  n  1,

j = 1, . . . , n.

one can easily see that with this set of numbers ij eq.(70) is similar to eq.(48) which
has additional term (vj) in the rhs:
