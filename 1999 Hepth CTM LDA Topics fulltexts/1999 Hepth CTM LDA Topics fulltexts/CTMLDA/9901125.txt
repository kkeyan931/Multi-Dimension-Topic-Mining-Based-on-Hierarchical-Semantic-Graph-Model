(1) term follows predecessor obvious integration parts. hence, unlike original ics, iecs depends locally eld strength potential, carries large gauge information. signature conventions (+,,), 012 = +1 = 012. shall rstly exhibit excitations described actions containing iecs, including especially sum maxwell action (etme). there, nd massless particle plus massive ghost. consider iecs gravitational background, higher derivatives necessarily engender metric dependence, contrast topological character ics, give rise stress tensor contributes explicitly energy etme, shall display terms two degrees freedom. 2. maxwellecs dynamics shall work source-free space section, aim characterize excitations described actions include iecs. clear (1) that, taken alone, iecs yields unconstrained massless propagation eld strength, next, dene extended system adjoining iecs maxwell action f = 0 . iet e = 1 2 r d3x resulting eld equations iet e/a = f mf = (mf + f) = 0 .

(6) one massless, massive, relative ghost sign. limit get e correctly reproduces maxwell propagator g /. small limit correspond pure iecs indeed nd get e m/2 , propagator corresponding (2). note that, irrespective signs (3), never tachyon: cannot ( m2) pole. next perform detailed canonical analysis, decomposing f terms vector potential (ai, a0), writing ai j ja + , i/2 , (i j ij) , yield f 0 = ijiaj = 2 , fi = + ij j e , e 2(a0 ) . action iet e reduces iet e = 1 2 r d3x(aa + e 2) + m1 r d3xea .
