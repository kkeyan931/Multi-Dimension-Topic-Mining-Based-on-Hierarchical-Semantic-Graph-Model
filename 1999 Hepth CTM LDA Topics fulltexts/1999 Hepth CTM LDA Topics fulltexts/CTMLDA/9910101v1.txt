the quantum eld theory describing electric and magnetic charges and revealing a dual symmetry
was developed in the zwanziger formalism. the renormalization group (rg) equations for both ne
structure constants  electric  and magnetic   were obtained. it was shown that the dirac relation
is valid for the renormalized  and  at the arbitrary scale, but these rg equations can be considered

introduction

the existence of the renormalization group (rg) in the quantum eld theory was discov-
ered by e.c.g.stueckelberg and a.peterman [1]. rg techniques was successfully devel-
oped by gellmann and low [2] in their investigation of the eective charge behavior.
they rst noticed that the derivative d log (p)/dt is only a function of the eective ne
structure constant:

(p) =

e2(p)
4

where e(p) is the eective charge, p is a 4momentum and

t = log

p2
m 2

(1)

(2)

with m as a momentum cuto.

in gauge theories without monopoles the gellmannlow rg equation has the follow-

ing form:

d log (p)

dt

= ((p))

where the function () depends on the lagrangian describing theory.

at suciently small charge ( < 1) the function is given by series over /4:

() = 2(


4

) + 4(

2

)


4

+ ...

(3)

(4)

the rst two terms of this series were calculated in qed long time ago [3,4]. the following
result was obtained in the framework of the perturbation theory (in the one and twoloop
approximations):

a)

and

b)

2 =

4
3

,

2 =

1
3

,

4 = 4

 for fermion (electron) loops

4 = 1

 for scalar particle loops.

(5)

(6)

this result means that for both cases a) and b) the function can be represented by the
following series:

() = 2(

)(1 + 3

+ ...)

(7)

and we are able to use the oneloop approximation up to   1 (with accuracy  25%
for   1).
in the present paper we consider the quantum eld theory when both electrically and
magnetically charged particles with charges e and g, respectively, present in the theory
which we call below as qemd (the quantum electromagnetodynamics). the aim of
this paper is to investigate the corresponding rg equations for electric () and magnetic
( ) ne structure constants in accordance with the dirac relation for the minimal charges:

below we consider qemd in the zwanziger formalism [5].

2 the zwanziger formalism for the abelian gauge theory with

electric and magnetic charges

a version of the local eld theory for the abelian gauge elds interacting with electrically
and magnetically charged particles is represented by the zwanziger formalism [5,6] (see
also [7]) which considers two potentials a(x) and b(x) describing one physical photon
with two physical degrees of freedom.

in this theory the total eld system of the gauge, electrically () and magnetically
() charged elds is described by the partition function which has the following form in
euclidean space:

z = z [da][db][d][d ][d][d ]es

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

where

the zwanziger action szw(a, b) is given by:

s = szw(a, b) + sgf + se + sm.

szw(a, b) = z d4x[
i
2

(n  [  a])(n  [  b]) 
where we have used the following designations:

+

1
2

(n  [  a])2 +

1
2

(n  [  b])2 +

i
2

(n  [  b])(n  [  a])]

[a  b] = ab  ab,

g

 =

(n  [a  b]) = n(a  b),
1
2

g.

sgf in eq.(12) is the gaugexing action and the actions se and sm:

se,m = z d4xle,m(x)

describe the matter elds with the electric and magnetic charges, respectively.

here we have a number of possibilities. the electrically and magnetically charged elds

can be described by the following lagrangian expressions (given in minkowski space):

a)

if they are fermions (electrons or monopoles, respectively). in eqs.(16), (17)

le = (id  e),
lm = (i d  m)

d =   iea

2

(16)

(17)

(18)

and

are the covariant derivatives.

d =   igb

(19)

(20)

(21)

if the electrically and magnetically charged particles are the kleingordon complex scalars.
but for the higgs scalars with electric and magnetic charges we have the following la-
grangians:

are the higgs potentials for the electrically and magnetically charged elds, respectively.
the complex scalar elds:

 =  + i1

and

 =  + i2

contain higgs (, ) and goldstone (1, 2) boson elds.

below we shall consider the gauge-xing action sgf chosen in ref.[7]:

sgf = z d4x[

which has no ghosts.

3 dual symmetry and charge quantization conditions

in the last years gauge theories essentially operate with the fundamental idea of duality
(see, for example, reviews [8] and references there).

duality is a symmetry appearing in free electromagnetism as invariance of the free

maxwell equations:

under the interchange of electric and magnetic elds:

  ~b = 0,
  ~e = 0,

  ~e = 0,
  ~b = 0,

~e  ~b,

~b  ~e.

3

(28)

(29)

(30)

letting

it is easy to see that the following equations:

f =   a = (  b),
f  =   b = (  a),

which together with the bianchi identity:

f = 0,

f 

 = 0

(31)
(32)

(33)

(34)

are equivalent to eqs.(28), show the invariance under the hodge star operation on the
eld tensor:

f 

 =

1
2

f

(35)

(here f  = f ).
invariance under the following duality transformations:

this hodge star duality applied to the free zwanziger lagrangian (13) leads to its

(  a)  (  b),
introducing the interacting maxwell equations:

f  f ,

(  a)  (  b).

f = je
,
 = jm
f 
 ,

with the local conservation laws for the electric and magnetic charges:

je,m

 = 0,

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

we immediately see the invariance of these equations under the exchange of the electric
and magnetic elds (hodge star duality) provided that at the same time electric and
magnetic charges and currents (and masses if they are dierent) are also interchanged:

e  g,

  jm
je



(40)

(also e  m and e  m).
selfconsistent if both charges are quantized according to the famous dirac relation [9]:

the corresponding quantum eld theory with electric ei and magnetic gi charges is

eigj = 2nij

(41)

when nij is an integer. for nij = 1 we have the dirac quantization condition (8) in terms
of the elementary electric and magnetic charges.

if the fundamental electric charge e is so small that it corresponds to the perturbative
electric theory, then magnetic charges are large and correspond to the strongly interacting
magnetic theory, and vice versa. but below we consider some small region of e, g values
(we hope that it exists) which allows to employ the perturbation theory in both, electric
and magnetic, sectors.

when nontrivial dyons  particles with both electric and magnetic charges simaltane-
ously  are present, then the analogue of the dirac relation becomes a bit more complicated
and it then sounds:

which is duality invariant (see for example the review [8] and the references there).

eigj  ejgi = 2nij

(42)

the relation (42) has the name of the diracshwingerzwanziger [5,9,10] quantization

condition. but in this paper the theory of dyons is not exploited.

4 propagators

at the same time with the partition function (11) let us consider the generating functional
with external sources j (a)

 , j (b)

 ,  and :

z[j (a), j (b), , ] =

= z [da][db][d][d ][d][d ]es+(j (a),a)+(j (b),b)+(,)+( ,)+(,)+( ,)

(43)

where

(j, a) = z d4xj(x)a(x),

and (, ) = z d4x(x)(x),

etc.

(44)

using this generating functional it is not dicult to calculate the propagators of the elds
considered in our model.

three bare propagators of the gauge elds a and b:

q0(a)

 =< aa >=

q0(b)

 =< bb >=

2z[j (a), j (b), , ]

j (a)

2z[j (a), j (b), , ]

j (a)

 j (b)



(45)

are presented in fig.1 (see fig.1(a)) together with the propagators q(a)
determined by fig.1(b).

 , q(b)

 and q(ab)



propagators (45) were calculated by authors of ref.[7] in the momentum space:

q0(a,b)



(q) =

m 2

a,b

(46)

the dot on the diagrams of fig.1(a,b) corresponds to the following operator:

q0(ab)



=

i
q2 

 = iq2

qn
(n  q)

.

qn
(n  q)

.

(47)

(48)

considering qed with lagrangian (16) for electrons (monopoles are absent in this case)
it is easy to see that the bare d0
(q2) and the dressed (renormalized) dren,(q2)
photon propagators obey the following relation presented in fig.2:

dren,(q) = d0

(q) + d0

(q)(q)dren,(q).

(49)

here the contribution of the electron loop is described by the operator (q) given by
the following expression:

(q) = e2 z

d4k
(2)4 t r[g(k)(k, k  q)g(k  q)]

(50)

5

where  is the dirac matrix,  is the renormalized vertex and g(k) is the dressed
propagator of the electron. taking into account the transversality of the photon self-
energy tensor we have:

(q) = (q2  qq)(q2).
ren,, q(b)

the dressed propagators q(a)
ren, containing the contributions of
the electric (thin lines) and magnetic (thick lines) charged particle loops are presented in
fig.3.

ren, and q(ab)

the lagrangians (16) and (17) contain the interaction terms je

a and jm

 b where je


and jm

 are the electric and magnetic currents:

and

 = e 
je

 = g .
jm

(52)

(53)

the interactions in the lagrangians (20)-(23) are given by je
seagull terms e2aa+ and g2bb+, respectively, but now we have:

a and jm

 b as well as by

(51)

(54)

(55)

and

je
 = e(+  +)

jm
 = g(+  +).

the simplest electron-electron, monopole-monopole and electron-monopole interac-
tions corresponding to the lagrangians le,m given by eqs.(16) and (17) are shown in
fig.4.

now we are ready to obtain the renormalization group equations for the eective ne
structure constants when both, electric and magnetic, charges present in our eld system.

5 renormalization group equations for the electric and mag-

netic fine structure constants

the gellmannlow rg equation (3) can be obtained by the calculation of the dressed
propagators. in the case of qed the relation shown in fig.2 gives us:

where the renormalization constant z3 is related, in its turn, with (q2) determined by
eqs.(50),(51):

d(q) = z 1

3 d0(q)

(56)

here  is the energy scale: q2 = 2.

z3 = 1  (2).

the gellmannlow -function is given by the following expression:

or

((p)) = 

 log z3
 log 2 ,

((p)) = 

 log (1  (2))

 log 2

.

6

(57)

(58)

(59)

in the oneloop approximation of the perturbation theory (see for example [11]) we can
write:

where m is the momentum cuto.

((p)) 

(2)
 log 2  

(m 2)
 log m 2

let us consider now the renormalization group equations for  and  when both

(electric and magnetic) charges present in our theory.

fig.3 shows the contributions of the electric (thin lines) and magnetic (thick lines)
charged particle loops to the dressed propagators q(a)
ren,. we consider also
the dressed propagators in loops assuming theory of the case a) with lagrangians le,m
given by eqs.(16) and (17).

ren, and q(b)

introducing the renormalization constants z3 and z3 by the following relations:

(63)
it is not dicult to calculate z3 and z3 according to the diagrams shown in fig.3. with
this aim we have used the expressions (46) and (47) obtained in ref.[7] for propagators
q0(a,b,ab)

. such calculations gave us the following result:



,



(60)

(61)

(62)

(64)

(65)

(66)

q(a)

ren, = z 1

1  (e)(2)
1  (m)(2)(z3 z3)
1  (m)(2)
1  (e)(2)(z3 z3)

1/2 ,

1/2 .

here (e)(2) and (m)(2) are given at q2 = 2 by the photon selfenergy tensors (e)

and (m)
 corresponding to the electron and monopole loops, respectively (see bubbles in
fig.3):

(e,m)



(q) = (q2  qq)(e,m)(q2)

where (e) (or (m)) is described by eqs.(50),(51) with e, e (or g, m) as a charge and a
mass of the electron (or monopole).

j.shwinger was the rst one who had shown (see refs.[10]) that the dirac relation (41)
is valid not only for the bare e0 and g0, but also for the renormalized eective charges
e and g. this means that for the minimal charges we have:

or

eg = (z3 z3)

1/2

e0g0 = 2,

z3 z3 = 1.

(67)

(68)

we have actually already rederived this result in the zwanziger formalism, since we can

obtain it by using (64) and (65). let us in fact multiply (64) on both sides with 1/z3 
(m)(2)/q z3 and (65) by 1/q z3  (m)(2)/z3 and then add the resulting equations.

the last ones become by the cancellation of  terms giving
qz3 + q z3 = 1/qz3 + 1/q z3,

(69)

7

from which it is easily seen that eq.(68) follows.

using this result we obtain the following important relations:

z3 = z 1

3 =

1  (e)(2)
1  (m)(2)

.

(70)

rg equations for the ne structure constants  and  immediately follow from eq.(70):

or

and

d(log (p))

= 

d(log (p))

 log 2

= (e)()  (m)( )

d(log (p))

dt

 log z3
 log 2 =

= 

 log z3
 log 2 = (m)( )  (e)().

here the analytical expressions for functions are given by the same eq.(59):

(e,m)( or ) = 

 log (1  (e,m)(2))

 log 2

,

(71)

(72)

(73)

(74)

but now these functions contain electron (e, e) and monopole (g, m) parameters,
respectively.

the obtained rg equations (72) and (73) obey the following equality:

d(log (p))

dt

= 

d(log (p))

dt

which corresponds to the dirac relation:

(t) (t) =

1
4

(for all t)

(75)

(76)

valid for the renormalized electric and magnetic ne structure constants at the arbitrary
scales.

the functions (e,m) are given perturbatively by the expressions similar to eq.(4):

and

(e)() = (e)

(m)( ) = (m)

(77)

(78)

the perturbative expansions (77) and (78) coincide with the series (4) calculated in qed,
at least on the level of the twoloop approximation. the monopole(electric) loops inside
of the electric(monopole) loops appear only on the level of the threeloop approximation.
of course, these functions are dierent if we consider magnetic scalar particles instead

of electric fermions, or vice versa. the corresponding coecients (e)

the charged particles.

if both matter elds are electrically and magnetically charged fermions or both are
scalars then we have the same expressions for the functions (e,m) and we can write the
following equations for the cases a) and b):

dt

= 

d(log (p))

(1 + 3

(79)

the last equations show that the oneloop approximation works with accuracy < 30% if
both  and  obey the following requirement:

0.25 < ,  < 1.

(80)

but strictly speaking, we dont know the exact behavior of the whole asymptotic series
(79).

in refs.[12] and [13] the behavior of the eective ne structure constants was investi-
gated in the vicinity of the phase transition point in the compact (lattice) qed by the
montecarlo simulation method. the following result was obtained [12]:

lat
crit  0.20

and

lat
crit  1.25.

(81)

these values almost coincide with the borders of the perturbation theory requirement (80).
in consequence, assuming that the phase transition couplings (81) may be described by
the oneloop approximation with accuracy not worse than (30  50)%, we have tried to
calculate them in the higgsed monopole model (see ref.[14]). the aim of the last paper
was to conrm, in general, the idea of the approximate universality (regularization
independence) of the phase transition couplings. the result obtained in [14]:

lat
crit  0.185

and

lat
crit  1.35

(82)

is in accordance with the lattice result (81). it seems that the idea of the approximate
universality for the rst order phase transitions is really conrmed.

7 conclusions

the aim of this paper was to obtain the renormalization group equations for the electric
and magnetic renormalized ne structure constants using the zwanziger formalism for
qemd. the result (see eqs.(72) and (73)):

d(log (p))

dt

d(log (p))

dt

= 

= (e)()  (m)( )

(83)

conrms the dirac relation (t) (t) = 1/4 existing at the arbitrary scale.

according to the philosophy given in the introduction it is possible to consider the
perturbation theory for (e)() and (m)( ) simultaneously if both  and  are suciently
small. then the functions (e,m) are given perturbatively by the usual series (4) or (7).
the calculations in qed (see section 1) have shown that the perturbation theory works
up to  < 1. due to the dirac relation (9), such a requirement leads to the following

9

condition:  > 0.25. in consequence, we have qemd rg equations with beta-functions
(e,m) considered perturbatively if both  and  obey the following requirement:

0.25 < ,  < 1.

crit  0.2 and lat

crit  1.25 (see refs.[12] and [13]).

just this case we have in the vicinity of the phase transition point for the compact (lattice)
