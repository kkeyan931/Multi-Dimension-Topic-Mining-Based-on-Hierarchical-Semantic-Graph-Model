abstract

we point out some misconceptions in a recent paper by h. aoki et al. in par-
ticular, the claim that the two-point function of branched polymers behaves as p4
instead of p2 for large p is mistaken and in no way a precondition for the hausdor
dimension of branched polymers having the well known value four.

1 introduction

branched polymers provide us with one of the simplest generalizations of random
walk. the theory of branched polymers is well known (see e.g. [1] and references
therein).

in a recent paper [2] it is claimed that the standard treatment of the theory of
branched polymers, as presented for instance in [1], is not correct. in this note we
show that this claim is false.

the problem under discussion concerns the propagation of branched polymers in
target space. this is analogous to the propagation of a particle in space-time or the
propagation of a bosonic string in 26-dimensional space-time. the grand canonical
ensemble provides a convenient framework for developing the theory and this is
how it is done in [1] and in many of the papers referred to therein. this approach
is claimed to be erroneous in [2], where the discussion is based on the canonical
ensemble. as we explain below, the basic requirement of the authors of [2] on the
relation between the two approaches, namely that the correlation functions in the
grand canonical ensemble at the critical value of fugacity should reproduce those in
the canonical ensemble for large n:

lim
n

gn
zn

= lim
c

g
z

,

(1)

is not relevant, and in fact incorrect.

in addition, we explain that the three main conclusions of [2] i.e. (i) that the
2-point function g(p) dierentiated w.r.t. the chemical potential  behaves like
1/p4 for large p, (ii) that the 3-point function behaves like

g3
(p, q)  g(p)g(q)g(p + q),

(2)

and (iii) that the 3-point function dierentiated w.r.t.  is given by

dg3

(p, q)
d

 g

(p)g(q)g(p+q)+g(p)g

(q)g(p+q)+g(p)g(q)g

(p+q), (3)

(eqs. (47-48) in [2]), are all obviously correct, and in fact trivial consequences of
what the authors call the naive approach. however, their claim that only the
dierentiated three point function is consistent with a correct thermodynamical
limit is misleading. eq. (2) is the correct 3-point function, dened in the same
way as one would dene a 3-point function in string theory, and it does not contain
any non-universal part. eq. (3) is not the 3-point function but (by denition) the
derivative of the 3-point function with respect to the chemical potential.

finally, the authors of [2] give some comments concerning the nature of baby
universes in the theory of branched polymers are which are supposed to support
the claims made. we point out that these speculations are mistaken.

2 explanation

let us introduce some notation. the random walk representation of the euclidean
propagator is given by

g(x1, x2) =



xn =1

en z

n

yi=1

dyi

n

yi=0

f (yi+1  yi),

yn +1 = x2, y0 = x1,

(4)

where f (x) is a suitable weight function which should fall o suciently fast. we
call (4) the grand canonical partition function for the random walk,  the chemical
potential and e the fugacity. there is a critical value, c, for  above which the
sum in (4) is convergent and below which it is divergent. we can write

g(x1, x2) = xn

en gn (x1, x2),  =   c,

(5)

and gn (x1, x2) is called the canonical partition function for the random walk, since
the internal volume (number of steps) n is xed. by fourier transformation we
dene g(p) and gn (p). close to the critical point c we have

such that

g(p) 

1

 + p2 , gn (p)  ep2n ,

g(p)  z dn en gn (p).

(6)

(7)

it is clear that the relation (1) is not satised for random walks, and there is no
reason why it should be satised, since the lefthand side is the heat kernel and the
righthand side is the propagator.

the value of the hausdor dimension of the random walk follows from (7).
without going into a detailed derivation (which e.g. can be found in [1]), we simply
note that n and  as well as p and x are conjugate variables. in the scaling limit
this leads to

i.e.

hni  x2,

(8)

hni 

1


1

,

|x| 

()

1

2

where hi is the expectation in an ensemble of walks whose endpoints are separated
by a distance x in imbedding space.

in the case of branched polymers one obtains similarly [1] for  close to c:

g(p) 

1

 + p2 .

(9)

this result is universal (as for the random walk) and contains no non-scaling part.
standard arguments [1], identical to the ones leading to the eqs. (8) for the random
walk, imply (in the scaling limit):

hni 

1


,

|x| 

1

()

,

1

4

i.e.

hni  x4,

(10)

3

which shows that the hausdor dimension of branched polymers is four.

as for the random walk the 2-point function g for branched polymers does not
satisfy (1), and for the same reason as before this fact does not disqualify it as the
correct propagator. of course the large-p behaviour of derivatives of g(p) w.r.t. 
is

dlg(p)

dl 

1
()l

+ o(p6),

1

2 p4

(11)

for l > 0. the fact that this large-p behavior of (11) agrees with the large-p behavior
of gn (p) derived from (9) does not make it the correct propagator for branched
polymers. in fact, it is simply the propagator for branched polymers with l marked
vertices since each dierentiation brings down a factor of n which is the number of
ways we can choose a vertex to mark.

next let us comment on eqs. (2) and (3). the derivation of (2), as presented in
[1], is acknowledged in [2], but the authors object that it does not satisfy (1). we
repeat that it is not a relevant objection as we have explained, and contrary to their
statements there are no non-universal terms contributing to this equation.

eq. (3) is an immediate consequence of eq.(2) by dierentiating w.r.t.  on both
sides.
indeed, it, and more generally eq. (52) of [2], can also be obtained before
taking the scaling limit by writing the factor n coming from the dierentiation as a
sum of the number of vertices associated with each propagator in the appropriate 3-
graph, taking care of the endpoint contributions for the propagators. in particular,
(3) is by denition not the 3-point function for branched polymers, but the 3-point
function for branched polymers with one additional marked point.

let us nally comment on the remarks made in [2] about baby universes. it is
claimed that one has a situation similar to two-dimensional gravity where a typical
surface will consist of a parent universe dressed with small baby universes that
are connected to the parent by a bottleneck. the argument is based on a relation
for the 1-point function1:

n > z dn  n gn g1
g1

n n .

(12)

however, this relation is only (approximately) valid when the entropy exponent
 < 0. in fact, it is usually used to derive that  < 0 in 2d gravity. for branched
n  n 2 = n 3/2 clearly shows
polymers  = 1/2 and (12) is not valid (inserting g1
that (12) is violated for branched polymers (and for all  > 0)). the reason is that
if there are numerous baby universes of all sizes, then (12) cannot hold, because
the decomposition of a graph with one marked point into a graph with two marked
points of size n  and a graph with one marked point of size n  n  is not unique.
a more rened treatment [1] leads to the conclusion that  > 0 implies  = 1/2
under very general conditions. the scenario with baby universes of all sizes when
 > 0 has been veried in numerous computer simulations (using, by the way, the
canonical ensemble!).

1for some reason eq. (55) in [2] misses a combinatorial factor n ,

leading to erroneous

conclusions.
