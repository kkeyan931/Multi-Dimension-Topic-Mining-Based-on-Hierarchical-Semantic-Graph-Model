we provide evidence for the validity of ads/cft correspondence in the coulomb

branch by comparing the yang-mills eective action with the potential between waves

on two separated test 3-branes in the presence of a large number of other 3-branes. for

constant gauge elds excited on the branes, this requires that the supergravity potential
in a ads5  s5 background is the same as that in at space, despite the fact that both
propagators and couplings of some relevant supergravity modes are dierent. we show

that this is indeed true, due to a subtle cancellation. with time-dependent gauge elds on

the test branes, the potential is sensitive to retardation eects of causal propagation in the

bulk. we argue that this is reected in higher derivative (acceleration) terms in the yang-

mills eective action. we show that for two 3-branes separated in at space the structure

of lowest order acceleration terms is in agreement with supergravity expectations.

1. introduction.

the duality between large-n strongly coupled n = 4 yang-mills theory in 3 + 1
dimensions and supergravity in a ads5s5 background [1] [2] has served as an appropriate
setting for discussing holographic nature of theories of gravity. traditionally this duality is

conjectured for the higgs branch of the yang-mills theory, corresponding to a large number

of coincident three branes, though the possibility that this could be valid in the coulomb

branch - corresponding to branes separated from each other - was suggested already in [1].

more recently, it has been argued by douglas and taylor [3] that the duality indeed holds

for the coulomb branch with brane positions identied with higgs vacuum expectation

values.

if the correspondence is valid for the coulomb branch, one would be able to get new

insight into the description of local physics in the bulk in terms of yang-mills theory and

thus eventually understand black hole complementarity. attempts to understand motion

of brane probes have been made in [4]. some evidence for ads/cft correspondence in

the coulomb branch has appeared in [5] and a dierent point of view is discussed in [6]

consider for example a higgs vev in the n = 4 theory of the form

the proposal is to identify zi
in the presence of (n  2) other branes - with all the branes parallel to each other.

2 with the transverse positions of a pair of three branes

now consider exciting this pair by turning on gauge elds f1 and f2 respectively. at

strong t hooft coupling, the low energy eective action for these elds should then give

the interaction energy between the branes. non-renormalization theorems [7] may be then

used to calculate this energy by performing a one-loop computation for special brane waves
like those made of constant gauge elds. the general one-loop answer for the o(f 4) term

is given by [8] [9] [3]

this one loop contribution is exact for n = 2 [7].

it is also exact for su (n ) in the

coulomb branch where all the higgs have nonzero expectation values in which case the

expression (1.2) should include a sum over all u (1) factors.
in [3] it has been argued
that the nonrenormalization theorems should still hold for our case, where su (n )

there is no proof as yet. this situation could be therefore compared to a supergravity

calculation.

(1.7)

in (1.6) the subscript |4 in the last term means that we retain terms containing four factors
of the gauge eld in the product.

let us rst consider the case where the gauge elds on the branes are constants. then

(1.5) is the only contribution to the eective action upto o(f 4).

on the supergravity side, the force between the pair is due to the exchange of su-

pergravity modes. with only the gauge eld excited these modes are the dilaton, axion,

2

longitudinally polarized graviton and the longitudinally polarized 2-form elds. when

n = 2 this is propagation in at space. in this case it is straightforward to understand the
terms in (1.6). the overall factor 1/4 comes from the static massless propagator in the

six transverse dimensions, which appears because the supergravity modes which couple to

constant gauge elds on the brane have zero momentum along the brane directions. the
rst term is due to the exchange of a dilaton, which couples to trf 2 on each of the branes
[10]. the second term comes from axion exchanges which couples to tr(f f ). the third
term comes from the exchange of a longitudinally polarized graviton which couples to the

energy momentum tensor t on the worldvolumes [10]. the last term comes from the

exchange of a 2-form eld, whose couplings have been obtained in [11]. (here the 2-form

couples to f on one of the branes and to a cubic in the elds on the other one). moreover,

the relative coecients between the various operators in (1.6) are exactly what is expected

from the couplings and propagators. the fact that the supergravity answer agrees with

the gauge theory truncation of the open string theory on the brane is well known in related

contexts [12].

for large n and in the scaling limit, however, the pair of branes are situated in the
ads  s5 produced by the n  2 other branes and one has to use the couplings and
propagators in this space-time. it is puzzling how the same yang-mills answer in (1.6)

in particular, the at
could be reproduced by supergravity in a nontrivial space-time.
space propagator 1/4 depends on the coordinate distance between the branes and not on
their individual locations - a feature which is not a priori expected in ads5  s5.

remarkably, as was shown in [3], the ads5  s5 propagator for elds which obey the
massless klein-gordon equation is identical to the at space propagator when restricted

to the zero brane momentum sector. examples of such elds are the dilaton and the

longitudinally polarized graviton. moreover, as is clear from the analysis of [11], the

couplings of these elds to the individual branes are the same as that in at space. thus the
rst three terms in (1.6) indeed follow from dilaton and graviton exchanges in ads5  s5.
in [3], it was claimed that the last term of (1.6) can be also explained by 2-form
exchange in ads5  s5. however, because of the presence of a nonzero 5-form eld strength
in the ads5  s5 background , the ns-ns and the r-r 2-forms mix with each other
through a chern-simons term in iib supergravity [13], leading to two independent branches

and these branches behave as massive elds. various other supergravity modes mix with

each other in a similar fashion. this phenomenon is crucial in a supression of the classical

s-wave absorption cross-section of the 2-form eld by three branes [14]. consequently, as

3

will be shown below, this leads to rather dierent propagators which reect the mixings

and also depend on individual brane locations. moreover, as shown in [11], the coupling of
the 2-form elds to the brane are dierent in ads5  s5 and at space. it would be rather
miraculous if inspite of such dierences, the supergravity calculation is able to reproduce

(1.6).

in this paper we show that this miracle indeed happens. the dierence in couplings

and the propagators conspire to reproduce the exact form of the two-form mediated po-

tential expected from yang-mills theory. we conjecture that this mechanism is quite

general and would be manifest in the interaction between other brane waves which involve

exchange of other supergravity modes displaying a similar mixing. our results provide

strong evidence for the validity of maldacena conjecture in the coulomb branch.

finally we address the question of causality in the bulk and its manifestation in the

yang-mills eective action.

in supergravity, the interaction between test branes occurs

through retarded potentials arising from causal propagation of supergravity modes. for

constant gauge elds on the branes, retardation eects are invisible and static propagators

in transverse space are relevant. however, for nonconstant waves, causality manifests itself

by producing an interaction energy which is bi-local on the brane 2. from the point of view

of the ads/cft correspondence, it may appear puzzling how the boundary yang-mills

theory knows about causality in the bulk. in particular when the two test branes are

separated only in the radial direction, the two locations map into the same point on the

boundary and causality in the boundary theory does not impose any restriction. in fact,

the yang-mills eective action is usually written as a sum of local terms.

we will argue that bulk causality is reected in the yang-mills theory in terms involv-

ing derivative of the elds. supergravity then predicts a specic structure of these terms.

we show this explicitly for the lowest order acceleration terms involving gauge elds in

the case of two test branes in at space by comparing the result with the eective action

of su (2) yang-mills theory. fortunately this term is not renormalized, thus a comparison
with supergravity is allowed. we expect that this will continue to hold in ads5s5, which
we will discuss in a future publication [15]. in general such considerations may lead to a

supergravity understanding of the acceleration terms in the yang-mills eective action.

2. propagators at zero brane momentum

consider the following metric in ads5  s5

ds2 = (

r
r

)2[dy  dy] + (

r
r

)2[dr2 + r2

5

xi=1

fi(i)(di)2]

(2.1)

we will use the following conventions. the ten dimensional coordinates will be denoted
by ya, a = 0,    9. out of these we continue to denote the brane worldvolume directions
by y,  = 0,    3. the remaining six transverse coordinates y5    y9 will be relabelled as
zi, i = 1,    6. r = qp6
i=1(zi)2 is the radial coordinate in the transverse space and i
are angles on the s5. (r, i) are related to the cartesian coordinates zi in the transverse

space by the standard transformations and the metric coecients fi(i) are determined

from these transformations.

in the following we will set r = 1 without loss of generality, and restore them using

dimensional analysis when required.

the action for a minimally coupled massless scalar in this background may be easily

seen to be

s =

1

2 z dt d3x d6z[

1
r4 (x)2 + (zi)2]

(2.2)

thus when the elds do not depend on the brane worldvolume coordinates, the action

is in fact identical to that of a massless scalar eld in at space. this means that the

propagator with zero worldvolume momentum is the at space propagator and given by

g(z1, z2) =

1

43|z1  z2|4

(2.3)

the dilaton and the longitudinally polarized graviton 3 behave like massless minimally

coupled scalars from the point of view of the six dimensional transverse space and therefore

has propagators given by (2.3). this is the result used in [3].

the longitudinally polarized 2-form eld is also a scalar from the point of view of the

transverse space, but it is not a minimally coupled scalar. more signicantly, there are

two such 2-form elds, the ns-ns eld which we denote by bab and the r-r eld which we

will denote by aab. these two elds are coupled with each other through the background

3 longitudinal polarization means that the tensor indices of the elds are along the 3-brane

worldvolume.

(2.5)

(2.6)

the last term is a chern-simons term which couples the two types of elds. this leads to

we are interested in the longitudinal components of the 2-form eld, so that in bab
the indices (a, b) take values a, b = 0,    3. the equations (2.6) and (2.7) then show that
a given component b mixes only with its dual 1

3. couplings in the dirac-born-infeld-wess-zumino action

the couplings of the relevant supergravity modes to a single brane in ads5  s5 may
be obtained from the dirac-born-infeld-wess-zumino (dbi-wz) action, and have been

studied in [11]. the action for a d3-brane in a general background of dilaton, graviton

and rank-2 elds is given by [16]

s = z d4qdet(g + f) +z ( c(4) + f  a + c(0)f  f )

(3.1)

[17] the two terms above correspond to the dbi action and the wz term respectively.

g refers to the induced world-volume metric, obtained as the pull-back of the spacetime
metric. similarly,

f = f  b

(3.2)

where f stands for the gauge eld on the d3-brane and b is the pullback of the ns-ns
two form potential. in the w-z term c(4), a and c(0) refer to the pullback of the r-r four
form, two form and zero form elds respectively. the dbi-wz action may be viewed as the
eective action of the yang-mills theory with su (n )  su (n1)u (1), with derivatives
on gauge elds ignored. the diagonal higgs which breaks the symmetry interpreted as

the position of a 3-brane probe. conformal transformations of the higgs elds in the

yang-mills description are metamorphosed into those of the transverse coordinates in
ads5  s5 due to modications of ward identities in the gauge xed theory [18].

we x a static gauge, setting the four worldvolume parameters to be equal to the
coordinates y in the metric and also x the kappa symmetry following [17] by setting
half of the fermionic elds in the brane action to zero. the couplings of the various

supergravity modes may be then obtained by performing an expansion around background
values (given by the ads5  s5 solution and the ve form background eld strength) and
then expanding the determinant to the required order.

we will consider the case when only the bosonic gauge elds are excited on the brane.

then the operator on the worldvolume which couples to the dilaton obtained by the above

procedure is

o = 

1
4

f  f

(3.3)

where indices of worldvolume elds are raised and lowered using the at metric. the

same operator couples to a brane in at space [10]. similarly the operator coupling to the

longitudinal components of the metric is also of the same form as in at space

(og) =

1
2

[f f 

 

1
4

 (f  f)]

(3.4)

8

in contrast the operator coupling to the antisymmetric tensor elds a and b dier in

important detail from their form in at space. the operator for the ns-ns form comes

from the dbi term and is given by [11]

where

(ob) = 

1
2

[f  +

r4 g]

g = [f

4

(f f)f ]

while that for the r-r eld comes from the wz term

(oa) =

1
4

f

in (3.5) r is the location of the brane in question.

if the brane was located in at space one would simply have

(ob)|at = 

1
2

[f  + g]

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

the factor of 1/r4 in front of g is now absent.

in [11] it was shown that the operator (3.5), modied by the prescription of [19], for

the nonabelian analog, represents the 2-form eld in the dual description in terms of a

yang-mills theory. note that for this to hold the supergravity modes to which they couple

have to be on shell. this played a crucial role in cancellation of dimension four fermionic

operators, which would have jeopardazied the ads/cft connection.

for our purposes such an interpretation is not necessary - we will simply consider

these operators for what they stand : coupling of individual branes to supergravity modes.

by the same token we remain o-shell.

the presence of the factor of 1/r4 (which is actually (r/r)4 once the r is restored)

in front of the dimension six term is related to the relationship between the infrared cuto

in ads space and the ultraviolet cuto in the dual gauge theory - a fact that is crucial

for holography [1],[20],[4]. when the dual theory is considered to live on the boundary

at large r this term may be thought of providing the ultraviolet cuto necessary to write
down a higher dimension operator in the gauge theory. the presence of this factor of 1/r4

in (3.5) will turn out to be crucial in what follows.

note the asymmetry between the ns-ns and r-r elds in the couplings. the 3-brane

is of course self-dual. in the dual formulation, the ns-ns elds are interchanged with the

r-r elds and the eld strength is replaced by its dual as well [21],[17].

9

because of the presence of the  in (3.7), it is natural to rewrite the coupling

li = b (ob) + a (oa)

in terms of the elds a

n introduced in the previous sections.

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

in the full ten dimensional theory, the interaction of the 2-form eld with a pair of

branes located at ~z = ~z1 and ~z = ~z2 may be then written as

z d4yz d6zxa,n

[a 

n (y, z) j a

n (y, z) + c.c.]

where

j a
n (y, z) = [6(z  z1) + 6(z  z2)]p a

n (y, z)

(3.12)

(3.13)

we are interested in the situation where the brane waves are constant along the brane, so
that the operators p are independent of y. in that case the y integration in (3.12) projects
out the zero brane momentum part of the elds a
n and one is left with an expression of
the form (2.15). since the measure in (2.15) is dxd5 while that in (3.12) it is dr d5 r5
one has

n (x, ) = r6 j a
j a

n (x, )

(3.14)

4. interaction energy of constant eld brane waves

we can now use the formulae in section 2. to derive the interaction energy between

brane waves due to 2-form exchange. this is the connected piece in (2.16), where we
substitute (3.14) and (3.13). note the additional factor of r6 present in (3.14) can be

absorbed by changing the measure in (2.16) to yield

z d6zz d6z[6(zz1)+6(zz2)][6(zz1)+6(zz2)]p a 

m (z)n ab

mn (z, z)p b

n (z) (4.1)

10

where n ab

mn is the zero momentum propagator which has been calculated above. the

interaction energy is given by the connected piece

e = p a 

m (z1)n ab

mn (z1, z2)p b

n (z2) + p a 

m (z2)n ab

mn (z2, z1)p b

n (z1)

evaluating (4.2) using (3.11) and (2.13) is straightforward. the nal result is

e =

1

434 [(f1)

 (f2)

(f2)

(f2)

4

(f1)

 (f2)

(f2)

(f2)

 + (1  2)]

 

(4.2)

(4.3)

using (3.8) and (2.14) it is easily seen that we get an identical result for just two three

branes located in at space. the relative factor of two in the overall normalizations of the

at space and ads propagators is crucial for this agreement.

two sets of important cancellations happened for each term over the indices (a, b)

1. terms quadratic in f s, like (f1)

, which could have been present because of
terms in p a
n linear in f , cancelled. if this did not happen, there would be no cor-
respondence with yang-mills. these would be loop corrections to the kinetic energy

 (f2)

terms, which cannot be present in this n = 4 theory.

2. both the propagator and the couplings depend on the individual brane locations ~z1
and ~z2. however these translation-noninvariant terms conspire to cancel each other
leaving with an answer which depends only on |~z1  ~z2|.

the structure in (4.3) is in precise agreement with the result of yang-mills theory given

in the last line (1.6).

since the couplings and zero momentum propagators for the dilaton and the graviton
are identical in ads5  s5 and at space we would trivially reproduce the rst two lines
of (1.6).

5. other brane waves

even for the simple brane waves considered above, i.e. constant gauge elds, the

agreement of yang-mills eective action in coulomb branch and the interaction between

branes in supergravity through single mode exchange depends on the non-trivial cancella-

tion demonstrated above. it is certainly worth understanding this mechanism by studying

other kinds of brane waves, e.g. excitations of fermions or higgs elds on the worldvolume.

of particular interest are fermionic operators. these would couple to the gravitons via

their contribution to the energy momentum tensor and to the two-form eld via operators

11

which have been derived in [11]. it may be easily veried, using the nature of the 2-form

propagators derived above, that the fermionic operators do not have a net contribution
from 2-form exchange both in ads5  s5 as well as in at space. this again is due to
cancellations, but now the contributions from the diagonal and the o-diagonal parts of
the propagators cancel separately 4. the yang-mills contributions may be read o from

the results of [8],[7]and [22].

when other brane waves are excited, various other supergravity modes will contribute

to the exchange and a priori their propagators would not be the same as in at space. for
example, with the higgs eld excited, there is a coupling with the trace of the s5 metric
which mixes with the rank-4 gauge eld polarized along s5 [13]. it would be interesting

to see whether similar cancellations hold in this case as well.

6. time dependent brane waves and causality in the bulk

so far we have restricted our attention to interactions mediated by supergravity modes

with zero brane momentum. this restriction hides an important piece of physics in the

bulk : causality. the point is that the force between any two objects is mediated by

retarded propagators reecting causal propagation and not by instantaneous action. this

does not have an obvious meaning in the yang-mills description. the base space-time of

yang-mills theory is identied with the directions y in the bulk, but there is no analog of

the radial distance r. consider for example two points which are separated in the ads5
space along the radial direction. a physical signal takes a nite time to travel between

these points. however in the yang-mills description these points are in fact the same

point in the boundary space. it seems rather mysterious as to how the yang-mills theory

encodes this nite time lag.

in the following we will argue that the supergravity prediction for force between branes

due to causal propagation of massless modes leads to a precise prediction for the structure

of higher derivative operators in the eective action in the yang-mills theory.

consider a general coupling to the test branes of the form given by (3.12) and (3.13).

for an arbitrary supergravity eld m this is given by

z d4yz d6z[

m (y, z) jm (y, z) + c.c.]

xm

(6.1)

4 the same mechanism is responsible for the on shell cancellation of dimension four fermionic

operators required for ads/cft correspondence to hold [11].

12

where

jm (y, z) = [6(z  z1) + 6(z  z2)]pm (y, z)

(6.2)

where indices m label various supergravity elds. the currents pm are made out of elds
on the brane. to illustrate the point, we will consider currents pm which depend only
on time. this, in fact, highlights the issue since the coupling of the elds in (3.12) are to

currents on the two branes which are at the same spatial position on the brane. then the

interaction energy is given by the expression

e = xm n

z dtz dt p 

m (t, z1) r

m n (t  t; z1, z2) pn (t, z2)

(6.3)

where r

m n denotes the retarded propagator, and we have assumed time translation in-
variance. in the special case considered in the previous sections, i.e. with time independent
pm , the time integrals pass through the currents and convert the retarded propagator
into a static propagator in transverse space. for general time dependence, this does not

happen and one is left with a bilocal expression for the interaction energy, given above.

the yang-mills eective action, however, is given as a sum of various terms which are

integrals of local densities on the brane worldvolume. in our example this involves a single

integral over time since the elds are assumed to be constant in space.

our proposal for comparing the supergravity and yang-mills expressions is to expand

the currents in (6.3) around the average time. introducing

t0 =

1
2

(t + t)

t = t  t

we nd from this taylor expansion

e = xm n

[z dt0p 

m (t0, z1)nm n (z1, z2)pn (t0, z2)

1

+

2 z dt0(0p 

m (t0))(0pn (t0)) z [d(t)] (t)2 r

m n (t; z1, z2) +   ]

(6.4)

(6.5)

where the dots denote higher order terms in t. the rst term involves the static propagator

nm n

nm n (z1, z2) = z dtr

m n (t; z1, z2)

(6.6)

which we considered in the previous sections. however the currents pm (t) are general
functions of time. in the general case they may be considered as general functions of the

13

brane worldvolume coordinates. this explains how supergravity generates f 4 terms in the

eective action, as in (1.5), even when the elds are not constant.

since the currents pn are composite operators involving gauge elds, the successive
terms in (6.5) should corrrespond to terms in the yang-mills eective action which are

higher order in a time derivative expansion. moreover, as we will see shortly, the integral

over t converts the expansion in terms of the time lag into an expansion in terms of the

magntitude of the transverse distance. the latter is, however, the magnitude of the higgs

expectation value and hence the scale below which the low energy eective action is valid.

this is a direct manifestation of the ir-uv correspondence. this has played a role in

earlier discussions of bulk causality [23].

causality in the bulk therefore provides a specic structure for these higher derivative

terms for the strongly coupled yang-mills theory, strong coupling being required for the

validity of the supergravity approximation of iib string theory. to check this proposal we

need to nd such operators which are protected by non-renormalization theorems, so that

we can perform a weak coupling calculation in the gauge theory.

in fact the simplest test involves currents which are linear in the gauge elds, which

couples to the 2-form eld in the bulk. in terms of the notation introduced above we then

have

1
2

p a
1 (t, z) =
2 (t, z) = f 0a(t) + i
p a

abc fbc (t) + if 0a(t)

1
2

abc fbc (t)

(6.7)

the rst term in (6.5) then involves two powers of the gauge eld and no derivatives -
these cancel as shown in section 4. the second term in (6.5) is of the form (f )2, which

is of weight four and hence protected by nonrenormalization theorems of [7]. we will

show soon that there is a net contribution to these derivative terms.

6.1. branes in at space and su (2)

the considerations of causality are equally relevant to the situation with two separated

three branes, with no other branes present. in supergravity, these are then located in at

space and we can evaluate the expressions easily. the yang-mills description is then in

terms of a su (2) gauge theory.

as before we deal with the 2-form elds with polarizations along the brane worldvol-

ume. the elds are assumed to depend on time and the transverse directions. we will

14

work in a gauge abab = 0. the action for these modes in a at background can be easily
worked out to be

s =

1

2 xa

z dtz d6z[|ta

1 |2 + |za

1 |2  |za

2 |2]

(6.8)

where the elds a
derivatives of the electric components a
the static propagator in transverse space. the contributions of a
in (6.5) cancel, essentially due to the negative sign of the kinetic term for a
shown in the previous sections. in the second term, only a

n have been dened in (2.9). note that the action does not involve time
2 , so that the propagator for this is essentially
2 to the rst term
2 - as has been
1 contributes and one is thus

1 and a

left with a term

xa

z dt0(tp a

1 (t0))(tp b

1 (t0))z dt (t)2 r,ab

11

(t; z1, z2)

(6.9)

where the retarded propagator for a

1 can be read o from the action (6.8)

r,ab

11

(t, z1, z2) = ab z dp0
2 z

d6p
(2)6

eip0t+i~p(~z1~z2)
(p0 + i)2  (~p)2

the integral in (6.9) may be easily seen to be

z dt (t)2 r,ab

11

(t; z1, z2) 

ab
2

(6.10)

(6.11)

where  is the transverse distance dened in (1.4). inserting the expressions for p a we get
a contribution for the interaction energy of the form

e 

1

2 z dt0 (tf1  )(tf 

2 )

(6.12)

this is precisely a term of weight four in the eective action of su (2) gauge theory, as may

be seen in [22]. this term is not renormalized since it is of weight four [7]. note that this
term has two less powers of  in the denominator compared to the f 4 terms which appear

in the zero momentum potential. this reects the ir-uv connection : an expansion in

the time interval gets translated into an expansion in the transverse distance, which is the

magnitude of the higgs and hence a scale in the eective yang-mills theory. also note
that this is the only term of weight four other than the f 4 terms when elds other than

the gauge eld are set to zero.

15

terms with higher weight will come from the higher terms of the taylor series, from the

f 3 terms in the 2-form coupling, and from exchange of other supergravity modes. it would

be interesting to see whether the corresponding operators also obey nonrenormalization

theorems.

when the brane waves depend on the spatial coordinates on the branes we expect the

time derivatives in (6.12) to be converted into space-time derivatives on the brane.

finally, we note that the calculation described above does not really probe the retarded

nature of the propagator - an advanced propagator would lead to the same result. strictly

speaking we have been investigating consequences of the nite speed of light rather than

causality. however, we expect that at higher orders the dierence of retarded and advanced

propagators will play a role.

6.2. branes in ads5  s5

the calculation outined above is a test for our proposal in the simplest possible setting.

a test of the proposal in the context of the ads/cft correspondence requires an analysis
which involves propagators of elds in the ads5  s5 background with nonzero brane
momentum. these propagators have been obtained in full generality [24]. we expect
that the signature of causal propagation in the ads5  s5 background in terms of the
higher derivative operators in the yang-mills eective action would hold in this case as

well. for this to work the cancellation which made the constant eld interaction energy in
ads5  s5 equal to the at space result should continue to work for non-constant elds.
our results in this direction will appear in a future publication [15].

this clearly shows the two branches of this eld found in [13]. these have masses k and

(k + 4) respectively.

the propagator may be now found by inverting the matrix. the result is
