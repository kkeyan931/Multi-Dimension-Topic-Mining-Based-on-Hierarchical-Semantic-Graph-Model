(4.5) standard way, take transition probability incoming state outgoing state b |hb|s(q)|ai|2 a+ b+ products creation operators 8 represent dierent collections particles. |ai = a+|0i hb| = h0|b hb|s|ai = h0|bsa+|0i (4.6a) (4.6b) (4.6c) following usual procedures hb|s(q)|ai expanded evaluated aid wicks theorem normal products. putting string absorption emission operators normal form one picks power q instead power -1. continuing procedure one arrives set feynman rules diering standard rules substitution q-dependent internal propagator usual internal propagators. one nds vector elds d(x) = (cid:18)g spinor elds m2 (cid:19)(cid:18) 1 2(cid:19)4 1 + q 2 z eikx(cid:18) 1 k2 m2 + 1 q 1 + q ko (cid:19)d4k (4.7) s(x) = (/ + m)(cid:18) 1 2(cid:19)4(cid:18) 1 q 2 (cid:19)z eikx(cid:20) 1 k2 m2 + 1 + q 1 q ko (cid:21)d4k = (~k2 + m2)1/2 . (4.8) (4.9) standard vector (spinor) eld q = 1(1) propagators reduce standard form. one may test expressions computing, example, electron-electron scatter- ing electron-positron annihilation. one obtains standard (moller) expression electron-electron scattering standard (bhabha) expression electron-positron annihilation expressions multiplied frame dependent factors. way one sees q-quantization imposed minimal way described breaks lorentz symmetry. somewhat similar result obtained discussing q-coulomb problem q-quantization (there dierently implemented) breaks rotational symmetry. propagators (4.7) (4.8) also illustrate pauli result lorentz group requires q = 1 bosons q = 1 fermions. preceding result suggests argument reversed postulating q- symmetry group outset. one may therefore introduce q-lorentz group dening spin representation lq follows: q detqlq = lt qqlq = lqqlt q , detqlq = 1 . (4.10) q q-deformed levi-civita matrix eq. (4.10) also denition q-determinant lq. q = 1, eq. (4.10) exactly denes spin representation lorentz group. see postulate q-lorentz invariance might work out, one may focus correlation functions (vacuum expectation values products interacting elds) since 9 determine structure theory. without going details, essential new element introduced q-symmetry interacting elds lie q-algebra and, simple systems already discussed, new degrees freedom give rise new quantum numbers determined hilbert space associated algebra. q-yang-mills theory connection eld would lie q-algebra rather lie algebra. associated fock space would direct product standard fock space generated q-fock space generated . yang-mills theories describe point particles, q-yang-mills theories describe particles internal degrees freedom. like thank professors fronsdal varadarajan comments.
