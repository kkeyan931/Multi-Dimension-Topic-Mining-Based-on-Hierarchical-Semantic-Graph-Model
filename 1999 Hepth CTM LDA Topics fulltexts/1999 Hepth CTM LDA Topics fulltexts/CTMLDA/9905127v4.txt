it has been conjectured that the abelian projection of qcd is responsible for the connement of
color. using a gauge independent denition of the abelian projection which does not employ any
gauge xing, we provide a strong evidence for the abelian dominance in wilson loop integral. in
specic we prove that the gauge potential which contributes to the wilson loop integral is precisely
the one restricted by the abelian projection.

the connement problem in qcd is perhaps one of
the most dicult problems in theoretical physics.
it
has long been argued that the monopole condensation
could provide the connement of the color through a dual
meissner eect [1,2]. more explicitly it has been conjec-
tured that the restricted part of qcd which comes from
the abelian projection of the theory to its maximal
abelian subgroup is responsible for the dynamics of the
dual meissner eect [2,3]. this conjecture, which asserts
that in non-abelian gauge theory only the degrees which
correspond to its maximal abelian subgroup should play
the important role in the infra-red limit of the theory,
is generally known as the abelian dominance, and has
recently been readdressed by many authors in the litera-
ture [4,5]. but the actual proof of the abelian dominance
and the monopole condensation in the low energy limit
of qcd has remained dicult.

a simple criterion for the connement is given by the
wilson loop: the area law for the vacuum expectation
value of the wilson loop for a large current loop of a
colored source, if established, could assure the conne-
ment. this suggests that the abelian dominance could
be tested through the wilson loop calculation. in this
direction, a remarkable progress has been made by the
numerical simulation during the last decade.
in fact,
the lattice calculation has conrmed the abelian dom-
inance, and showed that the dominant contribution to
the string tension of the q q pair (about 92%) comes from
the abelian projection of the theory [6,7]. if this is so,
one should be able to prove the abelian dominance with
a eld-theoretic method, independent of the numerical
simulation. the purpose of this letter is to provide a
theoretical proof of the abelian dominance in the wil-
son loop integral. in specic we prove that it is the re-
stricted connection, more precisely the gauge invariant
part of the restricted connection, which contributes to the
wilson loop integral. furthermore we show that the vac-
uum expectation value of the wilson loop integral can be
expressed as the weighted average of the loop integral of

the restricted connection, weighted by the eective action
of the restricted qcd. this, together with the proof of
the monopole condensation in the restricted qcd, will
endorse the dual meissner eect as the dynamical mech-
anism for the connement of color in qcd.

consider a non-abelian gauge theory of a given gauge

group g,

l = 

1
4

~f 2

 ,

(1)

where ~f is the eld strength. to prove the abelian
dominance in the infra-red limit, one must rst clarify
the meaning of the abelian projection, and show how
to project out the connection which corresponds to the
maximal abelian subgroup h from the full non-abelian
connection of the group g. for su (2) this means that
one should tell how to separate the u (1) component of
the connection in a gauge-independent way. to do this,
one must select the u (1) direction at each space-time
point, and make a gauge-independent projection of the
connection which contains only the u (1) degree. this
can be done by introducing a unit iso-triplet scalar eld
n(x) which transforms covariantly under the gauge trans-
formation, and insisting that n remains unchanged under
the parallel transport [2]. so we require n to be a covari-
ant constant,

d n = 0 (n2 = 1).

(2)

clearly n selects the u (1) direction at each space-time
point, and the parallel transport (2) provides the desired
abelian projection of the full connection ~a,

~a  a = a n 

1
g

n   n,

(3)

where a = n  ~a is the naive abelian component
(the electric potential) of the connection. this a is
the restricted connection we introduced some time ago

1

[2,3].
it has many interesting features. first, n being
gauge covariant, the projection (3) is obviously gauge-
independent. moreover, a retains the full su (2) gauge
degrees of freedom even though it is clearly restricted.
this is because the gauge-independent projection still
makes it an su (2) connection. indeed, under an arbi-
trary gauge transformation specied by an innitesimal
parameter ~, one has

n = ~  n,  ~a =

d~,

1
g

which guarantees

 a =

d

~ =

1
g

1
g

(

~ + g a  ~).

(4)

(5)

more importantly, a retains the full topological charac-
teristics of the original non-abelian potential. in fact, the
isolated singularities of n denes 2(s2) which describes
the non-abelian monopoles [2,8]. indeed a with a = 0
and n = r describes precisely the wu-yang monopole [9].
besides, with the s3 compactication of r3, n denes the
hopf invariant 3(s2) which describes the topologically
distinct vacuua [10].

the above discussion implies that there exists a sub-
class of the non-abelian gauge theory, the restricted
gauge theory, which contains only the restricted poten-
tial which nevertheless has the full non-abelian gauge
degrees of freedom [2,3]. to understand this, notice that
with the restricted connection (3) one has

f = (f + h)n,
f = a   a,

h =  1

g n  ( n   n) =  c   c,

(6)

where c is the monopole potential. to nd an explicit
form of c let

s = exp (t3) exp (t2) exp (t3),

where ti are the adjoint representation of the su (2) gen-
erators, and let

ni = s1ei

(i = 1, 2, 3),

(7)

where e1 = (1, 0, 0), e2 = (0, 1, 0), and e3 = (0, 0, 1).
now we identify n to be n3,

n = n3 = (sin  cos , sin  sin , cos ).

(8)

then under the gauge transformation s, one has

a  (a + c)e3,
f  (f + h)e3,

where

c =

1
g

(cos  + )

= 

1
g

n1   n2.

(10)

this shows that c describes precisely the diracs
monopole potential around the isolated singularities of n.
so the restricted gauge theory describes the dual dynam-
ics of the color charge and the non-abelian monopole.

with the restricted connection it is easy to obtain the
full connection ~a. since the connection space forms an
ane space, one can obtain a most general non-abelian
connection ~a simply by adding to a a gauge-covariant
vector eld ~x which is orthogonal to n,

~a = a n 

1
g
= a + ~x.

n   n + ~x

(11)

from (4) and (5) one can easily conrm that ~x indeed
forms a covariant multiplet,

 ~x = ~  ~x.

(12)

with (11) one has

~f = (f + h + x)n + d ~x  d ~x,

(13)

where x = gn  ( ~x  ~x ). furthermore with

~x = x 1

 n1 + x 2

 n2,

one has

d ~x = [x 1
+ [x 2

  g(a + c)x 2
 + g(a + c)x 1

 ]n1
 ]n2.

(14)

so one could express the lagrangian explicitly in terms
of a, n, and ~x,

l = 



1
4
1
4

(f + h + x )2

( d ~x  d ~x)2.

(15)

clearly this describes a u (1) gauge theory coupled to a
charged vector eld ~x. but the important point here is
that the u (1) potential is given by a + c, not just a.
the corresponding equations of motion is given by

(f + h + x ) = gn  ~x  ( d ~x  d ~x),

d( d ~x  d ~x) = g(f + h
+ x)n  x.

(16)

(9)

this allows us to interpret ~x as the valence gluon
which plays the role of a colored source of the restricted
theory [2,3]. more importantly this implies that ~x, just

2

like the quarks, represents simply another colored source
which has to be conned itself. this is the reason why
only the restricted connection (3) should play the domi-
nant role in the wilson loop integral.

notice that under the inverse gauge transformation

s1 which rotates e3 to n, one must have

a = (a + c)n +

1
g

tr(

1
2

~ts1s)

= a n 

1
g

n   n.

(17)

more importantly under the gauge transformation (3)
one has

(a + c) = (n  ~a) 

1
g

(n1   n2)

= 0.

(18)

this shows that (a + c)n is the gauge covariant part
of the restricted connection. this in turn allows us to
identify the gauge covariant part ~a(c)
 of the full connec-
tion,

~a = (a + c)n + ~x +

1
g

tr(

1
2

~ts1s)

= ~a(c)

 +

1
g

tr(

1
2

~ts1s).

(19)

this observation will become important in the wilson
loop calculation.

now we are ready to discuss wilson loop integral along
a closed curve c . the integral, although conceptionally
simple, has remained very dicult to carry out. but an
important step to simplify the integral was made by di-
akonov and petrov [11], who showed that integral for an
arbitrary representation ti can be expressed as a func-
tional integral over all gauge transformations s(t) along
the loop,

w (c) = trp exp [i ai
= z ds(t) exp [i

tidx]
2 i trt3(sas1

t

(20)

+

1
g

ss1)dx],

where a = ~a  ~t and t is the casimir invariant (i.e.,
the color charge) of the representation ti. now from (19)
we have



1
2

tr [ t3(sas1 +

1
g

ss1)]

= 

1
2

tr[s1t3s(a 

1
g

s1s)]

= a + c.

(21)

notice that this is precisely the gauge invariant part of
the restricted potential

3

a + c = n  ~a(c)
 .

(22)

this makes us to identify the gauge eld conguration
which is relevant to the wilson loop integral. it is indeed
the restricted gauge potential, more precisely the gauge
invariant part of the restricted potential, that contributes
to the wilson loop integral. this strongly endorses the
abelian dominance in qcd [2,3].

with (20) and (21) we can now obtain the desired ex-
pression for the vacuum expectation value of the wilson
loop,

< w (c) > = z dadnd ~x exp[
 it i (a + c)dx].

(23)

4 z ~f 2

 d4x

by integrating out the ~x degrees of freedom with a
proper gauge xing, one can express the integral as the
vacuum average of (20) over the eective lagrangian le
of the restricted qcd,

< w (c) > = z dadn exp[z le d4x

 it i (a + c)dx]
= z dad c exp{z [ le
+ it (a + c)j]d4x},

(24)

where

j = z 4(x  z(t))

and we have changed the variable n by c (it is under-
stood that d c includes the jacobian for the change of
variable). notice that here it is the eective action, not
the bare action, of the restricted theory which appeares
in the loop integral. this eective action will contain
all the dynamical informations necessary for the conne-
ment.

the above result shows that one can reduce the evalu-
ation of the wilson loop integral to the evaluation of the
generating functional of the restricted gauge theory for
the gauge invariant external current j. this is really
remarkable, but perhaps not so surprising. it has been
known that the evaluation of the wilson loop integral
could be related to the evaluation of a gauge invariant
part of the generating functional which is invariant under
the gauge transformation of the external current ~j [11].
our result not only conrms this but more importantly
drastically simplies the integral, which is made possi-
ble by identifying the precise eld conguration which
contributes to the wilson loop.

to proceed further one must know the eective action
of the restricted qcd. the actual calculation of the ef-
fective action goes beyond the scope of this paper, but

fortunately one can do this at one loop level. with the
monopole potential as the classical background, one can
show that the eective action does indeed provide the
monopole condensation [12]. with this the physics be-
hind our main result (24) becomes unmistakable. the
monopole condensation should squeeze the electric ux
of the colored source into a string, and generate the con-
ning potential for the colored objects.

the main point of the paper is to express the non-
abelian wilson loop integral in terms of the restricted
potential. mathematically this amounts to reducing the
non-abelian stokes integral to a quasi-abelian stokes
integral. there have been many unsuccessful attempts to
do this in the literature. we have shown how to do this
with the abelian projection. this by itself does not prove
the connement. the actual proof of the connement
should come from the calculation of the eective action
of the restricted qcd [12].

we close with the following remarks:
1) it must be emphasized that there is a crucial dif-
ference between our denition of the abelian projection
and that of the others.
in the popular denition of t
hooft, the abelian projection is regarded as a partial
gauge xing (called the maximal abelian gauge) of g/h
degrees [4,5]. in another denition which does not em-
ploy any gauge xing, the projection is not supposed to
depend on any particular set of eld congurations [13].
in comparison our abelian projection (3) selects a partic-
ular set of eld congurations (the restricted potential),
and is explicitly gauge independent. furthermore after
the projection the restricted potential still enjoys the full
non-abelian gauge degrees of freedom.

2) one should keep in mind that one does not have to
have the linear potential, and the wilson loop integral
does not have to generate the area law, to guarantee the
connement. this is because asymtotically the q q string
can break by creating the pairs. this screening eect
could saturate the linear potential, and thus compromize
the area law. only when one neglects this dynamical
possibility of the pair creation in the wilson loop integral,
one can obtain the area law.

3) the lattice simulations suggest that the gluon loop
does not generate a linear potential, so that the area
law may not hold for the adjoint representations [14].
this has been (incorrectly) attributed to the screening
eect in the literature. this appears to contradict with
our result, according to which the quark and the gluon
loops give the same integral expression except for the
color charge t . but this appearence is misleading, be-
cause they contribute oppositely to the eective action.
in fact one can demonstrate that, just as in the asymtotic
freedom, the gluons tend to make pair annihilations but
the quarks tend to make pair creations. this means that
the gluons generate an anti-screening eect, while the
quarks generate the screening eect [12]. so our result
can naturally explain why the gluon loop does not obey

4

the area law. but we emphasize that the correct reason
for this is not the screening eect, but the anti-screening
eect.

it must be straightforward to generalize our result to
an arbitrary group [3,8]. a more detailed discussion, in-
cluding the proof of the monopole condensation and the
derivation of the eective action for the restricted qcd,
will be given in a forthcoming paper [12,15].
