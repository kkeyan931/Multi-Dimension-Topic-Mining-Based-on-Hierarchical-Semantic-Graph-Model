abstract

on the basis of the weyl equations of congruent transference, we consider
a possible inuence of the weyl non-abelian gauge eld dening the transfer-
ence on the precession of a gyroscope. plane-wave solutions to the equations
of the non-abelian gauge eld are derived.

1.in ref.[1] it has been shown that the congruent transference introduced by weyl
[2] in 1922 denes a non-abelian gauge eld. in ref.[3], we have constructed a spinor
representation of the weyl gauge group and found the corresponding spinor current
that is a source of the above gauge eld. since there exists the spinor source of a
non-abelian gauge eld, it makes sense to question about observable manifestations
of that sort of interactions on macroscopic scales. one possibility is considered in
this note.
it is shown that if a rotating body undergoes neither electromagnetic
nor gravitational forces, the precession of the intrinsic angular momentum can be
caused by the non-abelian gauge eld under consideration.

as it is known (see, e.g.,[4]), the most general law of parallel transference of
vectors along a given curve xi = xi( ) is dened by the system of ordinary dierential
equations of the form

ds i
d

= i

jkujs k,

where ui = dxi/d. from the condition for the length of a vector being conserved
in the parallel transference it follows that the coecients of linear connection i
jk
should obey the system of algebraic equations

jgik  l

jiglk  l

jkgil = 0.

it is assumed that the metric tensor gij is given, and the scalar product is dened by
g(s, s) = gijs is j. the general solution to this system of equations can be written
in the form [2]

(1)
where gi
jk = gilgjkl and gjkl is a second-rank tensor eld skew-symmetric in the
last two indices gjkl + gjlk = 0. it is just the weyl non-abelian gauge eld whose

jk,

properties have been considered in the above-mentioned papers. in formula (1), {i
denote, as usual, the components of levi-civita connection of the metrics gij

{i

gil(jgkl + kgjl  lgjk).

connection (1) denes the congruent transference introduced by weyl according to
which a vector eld is changed by that transference as follows:

ds i
d

+ {i

jk}ujs k = gi

jkujs k.

(2)

the law of transference (2) includes the displacement belonging to the riemannian
geometry and rotation dened by the metric gij and bivector gjkluj. the weyl gauge
theory is a realization of the abstract theory of gauge elds within the dierential
geometry whose specic feature is that it does not distinguish between space-time
and a gauge space [1]. in this note, we discuss a possible physical manifestation of
the non-abelian gauge eld gi

jk.

2. let us consider a rotating body, for instance, a gyroscope, that is accelerated
by forces applied to its center of mass. forces of this sort produce no torque,
therefore, they do not change the vector length s i of the proper angular momentum,
but appear as its precession called the thomas precession. we will apply equations
(2) to describe the thomas precession of a gyroscope initiated by the weyl gauge
eld. the produced rotation should preserve the orthogonality of the vector of the
intrinsic angular momentum of a body s i and 4-velocity ui. in view of (2) and the
gauge tensor eld gijk being skew-symmetric in the last two indices, we obtain




(uis i) =

ui


si + ui

s i


=

ui


si  uigi

jkujs k = (

ui


+ gi

jkujuk)si,

where / is an absolute derivative. then it follows that if the center of gravity of
a gyroscope moves along the trajectory that is given by the equations of geodesics
in connection (1)

then

ui


+ gi

jkujuk = 0,




(uis i) = 0.

(3)

thus, equations (2) are capable of describing precession of the proper angular mo-
mentum of a body in the framework of dynamics given by equations (3). let us
discuss them in greater detail.

3. of great importance are quantities irreducible with respect to the fundamental
group of symmetry. if this principle is applied to the eld gijk,, it is necessary to
consider global transformations of the weyl gauge group that is structured like the
lorentz group. the tensor gijk, with respect to this group is decomposable into

2

irreducible components. according to the results of ref. [5] this expansions looks as
follows:

2
3

1
3

gijk =

(tijk  tikj) +

(gijfk  gikfj) + eijklal,

(4)

where eijkl is a completely antisymmetric levi-civita tensor and other quantities
are dened in the following way:

fi = gjkgjki, ai =

1
6

eijklgjkl,

tijk =

1
2

(gijk + gjik) +

1
6

(gkifj + gkjfi) 

1
3

gijfk.

consider the case when irreducible components tijk = 0, ai = 0. then it can be

set

inserting (5) into (3), we get

gijk = gijfk  gikfj.

ui


+ f i  ui(ukf k) = 0,

(5)

(6)

since uiui = 1. within the relativistic mechanics [6], an accelerated motion of a
particle with mass m is determined by equations

ai =

ui


=

d2xi
d 2 + {i

jk}

dxj
d

dxk
d

=

1
m

n i,

(7)

where n i is a 4-force orthogonal to a 4-velocity. so, an irreducible component
given by the polar vector f i, permits physical interpretation in the framework of
relativistic mechanics provided that 1

mn i = f i + ui(ukf k).

consider now how substitution (5) is consistent with the equations of motion of
the eld gijk, proposed in [1], [3]. equations of the gauge eld gijk are of the form

ibijkl + gk

imbijml  gl

imbijmk + s jkl = 0,

where

bijkl = igjkl  jgikl + gikmgm

jl  gjkmgm

il + rijkl

(8)

is the strength tensor and the tensor s jkl is the current, a source of the gauge eld
it is assumed that the current s ijk is given and obeys the
under consideration.
equations

is ijk + gj

ims imk  gk

ims imj = 0

that are analogous to the local conservation law of energy-momentum in general
relativity [3].

inserting (5) into (9), we get

3

bijkl =

gijkl(fmf m) + gijmk(m + f m)fl  gijml(m + f m)fk + rijkl,

where gijkl = gikgjl  gilgjk. the system of equations (5) and (8) for the eld fi is
complicated and, besides, the number of equations is much larger than the number
of unknown functions. therefore, one should verify whether system (5) and (8) is
consistent or not. contracting equations (8) in indices j and l, we arrive at the
equations

ibik + gk

imbim + gijmbijmk + s k = 0,

(10)

where bik = gjlbijkl, s k = gjls jkl. contraction in indices j and k, produces analo-
gous equations; whereas that in k and l, an identity. so, any solution to eqs. (8) is
a solution to eqs. (10). inserting (5) into (10), we get

ibik  fm(bmk + bkm) + f kb + s k = 0,

(11)

where b = gijbij. like the strength tensor bijkl we can express the tensors bij, b
in terms of the eld fi:

bij = 2gijfmf m  2(i + fi)fj  gijmf m + rij,

b = 6(fmf m  mf m) + r,

(12)

(13)

where rij is the ricci tensor, the r-scalar curvature of space-time. substituting (12)
and (13) into (11), we nd that any solution to equations (5) and (8) is a solution
to the equations

iif k + 3f k(if i  fif i) +

1
2

k(if i  3fif i) =

1
2

s k,

(14)

where we put rijkl = 0.

to prove the consistency of system of equations (5) and (8) we show that it
possesses nontrivial solutions at s ijk = 0, rijkl = 0. one of the solutions looks as
follows:

pi
pmxm ,

fi =

p0x0 + p1x1 + p2x2 + p3x3 =

pi

where pi is a constant non-isotropic vector eld, pipi 6= 0.

it can be veried that eqs. (14) are fullled with that solution. calculating the

strength tensor we obtain

bijkl = gijkl

pmpm
(pnxn)2 .

and inserting this expression into eld equations (8) we see that they also hold valid.
(5) and (8) without sources is a plane wave of an

another solution to eqs.

arbitrary shape:

fi = ki(kx),

4

where ki is an isotropic (a null) vector, kiki = 0, kx = kixi. in this case, the strength
tensor is given by

bijnl = (



+ 2)(gijmnkl  gijmlkn)km,

where  is the derivative with respect to argument. thus, system of equations (5)
and (8) is consistent.

if in equations (14) we omit the terms with self-action and put s k = 0, we obtain

the equations which are a particular case (at  = 3/2) of the equations

iiak  (1  )kiai = 0,

that are employed in quantum electrodynamics for xing gauge of the vector poten-
tial ai [7].

4. to summarize, we dwell on a possible physical interpretation of our considera-
tion. if a rotating body which does not undergo any torque but suers acceleration,
the direction of its rotation with respect to the inertial system changes in accor-
dance with the rule of transference (2). then it follows that we can qualitatively
try to discover the weyl non-abelian gauge eld by observing the behaviour of a
gyroscope at a cosmic station. since gravitational and electromagnetic forces can
there be assumed zero, the gyroscope precession, if discovered, could be induced by
that gauge eld.

we express our gratitude to r.asanov and e.kuraev for useful discussions and
