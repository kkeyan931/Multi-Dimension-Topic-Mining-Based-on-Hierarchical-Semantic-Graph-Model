abstract

this is a brief introductory review of the ads/cft correspondence and of the ideas
that led to its formulation. emphasis is placed on dualities between conformal large n
gauge theories in 4 dimensions and string backgrounds of the form ads5x5. attempts
to generalize this correspondence to asymptotically free theories are also included.

1 introduction

it is well-known that string theory originated from attempts to understand the strong
interactions [1]. however, after the emergence of qcd as the theory of hadrons, the
dominant theme of string research shifted to the planck scale domain of quantum grav-
ity [2]. although in hadron physics one routinely hears about ux tubes and the string
tension, the majority of particle theorists gave up hope that string theory might lead
to an exact description of the strong interactions. now, however, for the rst time we
can say with condence that at least some strongly coupled gauge theories have a dual
description in terms of strings. let me emphasize that one is not talking here about
eective strings that give an approximate qualitative description, but rather about an
exact duality. at weak coupling a convenient description of the theory involves conven-
tional perturbative methods; at strong coupling, where such methods are intractable,
the dual string description simplies and gives exact information about the theory.
the best established examples of this duality are conformal gauge theories where the
so-called ads/cft correspondence [3, 4, 5] has allowed for many calculations at strong
coupling to be performed with ease. in these notes i describe, from my own personal
perspective, some of the ideas that led to the formulation of the ads/cft correspon-
dence.
i will also speculate on the future directions. for the sake of brevity i will
mainly discuss the ads5/cft4 case which is most directly related to 4-dimensional
gauge theories.

it has long been believed that the best hope for a string description of non-abelian
gauge theories lies in the t hooft large n limit. a quarter of a century ago t hooft
proposed to generalize the su(3) gauge group of qcd to su(n), and to take the
large n limit while keeping g2
ymn xed [6]. in this limit each feynman graph carries
a topological factor n , where  is the euler characteristic of the graph. thus, the
sum over graphs of a given topology can perhaps be thought of as a sum over world
sheets of a hypothetical qcd string. since the spheres (string tree diagrams) are
weighted by n 2, the tori (string one-loop diagrams)  by n 0, etc., we nd that the
closed string coupling constant is of order n 1. thus, the advantage of taking n to
be large is that we nd a weakly coupled string theory. it is not clear, however, how
to describe this string theory in elementary terms (by a 2-dimensional world sheet
action, for example). this is clearly an important problem: the free closed string
spectrum is just the large n spectrum of glueballs. if the quarks are included, then
we also nd open strings describing the mesons. thus, if methods are developed for
calculating these spectra, and it is found that they are discrete, then this provides an
elegant explanation of connement. furthermore, the 1/n corrections correspond to
perturbative string corrections.

many years of eort, and many good ideas, were invested into the search for an

1

exact gauge eld/string duality [7]. one class of ideas, exploiting the similarity of the
large n loop equation with the string schroedinger equation, eventually led to the
following fascinating speculation [8]: one should not look for the qcd string in four
dimensions, but rather in ve, with the fth dimension akin to the liouville dimension
of non-critical string theory [9]. this leads to a picture where the qcd string is
described by a two-dimensional world sheet sigma model with a curved 5-dimensional
target space. at that stage it was not clear, however, precisely what target spaces
are relevant to gauge theories. luckily, we now do have answers to this question for a
variety of conformal large n gauge models. the route that leads to this answer, and
conrms the idea of the fth dimension, involves an unexpected detour via black holes
and dirichlet branes. we turn to these subjects next.

2 d-branes vs. black holes and p-branes

a few years ago it became clear that, in addition to strings, superstring theory contains
soliton-like membranes of various internal dimensionalities called dirichlet branes (or
d-branes) [10]. a dirichlet p-brane (or dp-brane) is a p + 1 dimensional hyperplane
in 9 + 1 dimensional space-time where strings are allowed to end, even in theories
where all strings are closed in the bulk of space-time.
in some ways a d-brane is
like a topological defect: when a closed string touches it, it can open open up and
turn into an open string whose ends are free to move along the d-brane. for the
end-points of such a string the p + 1 longitudinal coordinates satisfy the conventional
free (neumann) boundary conditions, while the 9  p coordinates transverse to the
dp-brane have the xed (dirichlet) boundary conditions; hence the origin of the term
dirichlet brane. in a seminal paper [11] polchinski showed that the dp-brane is a
bps saturated object which preserves 1/2 of the bulk supersymmetries and carries
an elementary unit of charge with respect to the p + 1 form gauge potential from the
ramond-ramond sector of type ii superstring. the existence of bps objects carrying
such charges is required by non-perturbative string dualities [12]. a striking feature of
the d-brane formalism is that it provides a concrete (and very simple) embedding of
such objects into perturbative string theory.

another fascinating feature of the d-branes is that they naturally realize gauge
theories on their world volume. the massless spectrum of open strings living on a dp-
brane is that of a maximally supersymmetric u(1) gauge theory in p + 1 dimensions.
the 9p massless scalar elds present in this supermultiplet are the expected goldstone
modes associated with the transverse oscillations of the dp-brane, while the photons
and fermions may be thought of as providing the unique supersymmetric completion.
if we consider n parallel d-branes, then there are n 2 dierent species of open strings
because they can begin and end on any of the d-branes. n 2 is the dimension of the

2

adjoint representation of u(n), and indeed we nd the maximally supersymmetric
u(n) gauge theory in this setting [13]. the relative separations of the dp-branes in
the 9 p transverse dimensions are determined by the expectation values of the scalar
elds. we will be primarily interested in the case where all scalar expectation values
vanish, so that the n dp-branes are stacked on top of each other. if n is large, then
this stack is a heavy object embedded into a theory of closed string which contains
gravity. naturally, this macroscopic object will curve space:
it may be described by
some classical metric and other background elds, such as the ramond-ramond p + 1
form potential. thus, we have two very dierent descriptions of the stack of dp-branes:
one in terms of the u(n) supersymmetric gauge theory on its world volume, and the
other in terms of the classical ramond-ramond charged p-brane background of the
type ii closed superstring theory. it is the relation between these two descriptions that
is at the heart of the recent progress in understanding the connections between gauge
elds and strings.1 of course, more work is needed to make this relation precise.

2.1 counting the entropy

the rst success in building this kind of correspondence between black hole met-
rics and d-branes was achieved by strominger and vafa [15]. they considered 5-
dimensional supergravity obtained by compactifying 10-dimensional type iib theory
on a 5-dimensional compact manifold (for example, the 5-torus), and constructed a
class of black holes carrying 2 separate u(1) charges. these solutions may be viewed
as generalizations of the well-known 4-dimensional charged (reissner-nordstrom) black
hole. for the reissner-nordstrom black hole the mass is bounded from below by a
quantity proportional to the charge. in general, when the mass saturates the lower
(bps) bound for a given choice of charges, then the black hole is called extremal. the
extremal strominger-vafa black hole preserves 1/8 of the supersymmetries present in
vacuum. also, the black hole is constructed in such a way that, just as for the reissner-
nordstrom solution, the area of the horizon is non-vanishing at extremality [15]. in
general, an important quantity characterizing black holes is the bekenstein-hawking
entropy which is proportional to the horizon area:

sbh =

ah
4g

,

(1)

where g is the newton constant. strominger and vafa calculated the bekenstein-
hawking entropy of their extremal solution as a function of the charges and succeeded
in reproducing this result with d-brane methods. to build a d-brane system carrying
the same set of charges as the black hole, they had to consider intersecting d-branes

1 there are other similar relations between large n sym theories and gravity stemming from the

bfss matrix theory conjecture [14].

3

wrapped over the compact 5-dimensional manifold. for example, one may consider
d3-branes intersecting over a line or d1-branes embedded inside d5-branes. the 1 + 1
dimensional gauge theory describing such an intersection is quite complicated, but the
degeneracy of the supersymmetric bps states can nevertheless be calculated in the d-
brane description valid at weak coupling. for reasons that will become clear shortly, the
description in terms of black hole metrics is valid only at very strong coupling. luckily,
due to the supersymmetry, the number of states does not change as the coupling is
increased. this ability to extrapolate the d-brane counting to strong coupling makes
a comparison with the bekenstein-hawking entropy possible, and exact agreement is
found in the limit of large charges [15]. in this sense the collection of d-branes provides
a microscopic explanation of the black hole entropy.

this correspondence was quickly generalized to black holes slightly excited above the
extremality [16, 17]. further, the hawking radiation rates and the absorption cross-
sections were calculated and successfully reproduced by d-brane models [16, 18, 19].
since then this system has been receiving a great deal of attention. however, some
detailed comparisons are hampered by the complexities of the dynamics of intersecting
d-branes: to date there is no rst principles approach to the lagrangian of the 1 + 1
dimensional conformal eld theory on the intersection.

for this and other reasons it has turned out very fruitful to study a similar corre-
spondence for simpler systems which involve parallel d-branes only [20, 21, 22, 23, 24].
our primary motivation is that, as explained above, parallel dp-branes realize p + 1
dimensional u(n) sym theories, and we may learn something new about them from
comparisons with ramond-ramond charged black p-brane classical solutions. these
solutions in type ii supergravity have been known since the early 90s [25, 26]. the
metric and dilaton backgrounds may be expressed in the following simple and universal
form:

ds2 = h 1/2(r)"f (r)dt2 +

p

xi=1

(dxi)2# + h 1/2(r)hf 1(r)dr2 + r2d2

e = h (3p)/4(r) ,

h(r) = 1 +

l7p

f (r) = 1 

r7p

r7p ,

and d2
8p is the metric of a unit 8  p dimensional sphere. the horizon is located at
r = r0 and the extremality is achieved in the limit r0  0. a solution with r0  l
is called near-extremal. in contrast to the situation encountered for the strominger-
vafa black hole, the bekenstein-hawking entropy vanishes in the extremal limit. just
like the stacks of parallel d-branes, the extremal solutions are bps saturated: they
preserve 16 of the 32 supersymmetries present in the type ii theory. for r0 > 0 the

4

p-brane carries some excess energy e above its extremal value, and the bekenstein-
hawking entropy is also non-vanishing. the hawking temperature is then dened by
t 1 = sbh /e.

the correspondence between the entropies of the p-brane solutions (2) and those
of the p + 1 dimensional sym theories was rst considered in [20, 21]. among these
solutions p = 3 has a special status: in the extremal limit r0  0 the 3-brane solution is
perfectly non-singular [27]. this is evidenced by the fact that the dilaton  is constant
for p = 3, but blows up at r = 0 for all other extremal solutions. in [20] the bekenstein-
hawking entropy of a near-extremal 3-brane of hawking temperature t was compared
with the entropy of the n = 4 supersymmetric u(n) gauge theory (which lives on
n coincident d3-branes) heated up to the same temperature. the results turned out
to be quite interesting. the bekenstein-hawking entropy expressed in terms of the
hawking temperature t and the number n of elementary units of charge was found
to be

sbh =

n 2v3t 3 ,

(3)

2
2

22

where v3 is the spatial volume of the 3-brane. this was compared with the entropy of a
free u(n) n = 4 supermultiplet, which consists of the gauge eld, 6n 2 massless scalars
and 4n 2 weyl fermions. this entropy was calculated using the standard statistical
mechanics of a massless gas (the black body problem), and the answer turned out to
be

s0 =

n 2v3t 3 .

(4)

it is remarkable that the 3-brane geometry captures the t 3 scaling characteristic of a
conformal eld theory (in a cft this scaling is guaranteed by the extensivity of the
entropy and the absence of dimensionful parameters).2 also, the n 2 scaling indicates
the presence of o(n 2) unconned degrees of freedom, which is exactly what we expect
in the n = 4 supersymmetric u(n) gauge theory. on the other hand, the relative
factor of 3/4 between sbh and s0 at rst appeared mysterious and was interpreted by
many as a subtle failure of the d3-brane approach to black 3-branes. as we will see
shortly, however, the relative factor of 3/4 is not a contradiction but rather a prediction
about strongly coupled n = 4 sym theory at nite temperature.

2 other examples of the conformal behavior of the bekenstein-hawking entropy include the 11-
dimensional 5-brane and membrane solutions [21]. for the 5-brane, sbh  n 3t 5v5, while for the
membrane sbh  n 3/2t 2v2. the microscopic description of the 5-brane solution is in terms of a
large number n of coincident singly charged 5-branes of m-theory, whose chiral world volume theory
has (0, 2) supersymmetry. similarly, the membrane solution describes the large n behavior of the
cft on n coincident elementary membranes. the entropy formulae suggest that these theories have
o(n 3) and o(n 3/2) massless degrees of freedom respectively. these predictions of supergravity [21]
are non-trivial and still mysterious. since the geometry of the 5-brane throat is ads7 s 4, and that of
the membrane throat is ads4  s 7, these systems lead to other interesting examples of the ads/cft
correspondence.

2.2 from absorption cross-sections to two-point correlators

almost a year after the entropy comparisons [20, 21] i came back to the 3-branes (and
also to the 11-dimensional membranes and 5-branes) and tried to interpret absorption
cross-sections for massless particles in terms of the world volume theories [22]. this
was a natural step beyond the comparison of entropies, and for the strominger-vafa
black holes the d-brane approach to absorption was initiated earlier in [16, 18]. for
the system of n coincident d3-branes it was interesting to inquire to what extent the
supergravity and the weakly coupled d-brane calculations agreed. for example, they
might scale dierently with n or with the incident energy. even if the scaling exponents
agreed, the overall normalizations could dier by a subtle numerical factor similar to
the 3/4 found for the 3-brane entropy. surprisingly, the low-energy absorption cross-
sections turned out to agree exactly!

to calculate the absorption cross-sections in the d-brane formalism one needs the
low-energy world volume action for coincident d-branes coupled to the massless bulk
elds. luckily, these couplings may be deduced from the d-brane born-infeld action.
for example, the coupling of 3-branes to the dilaton , the ramond-ramond scalar
c, and the graviton h is given by [22, 23]

sint =


 z d4x(cid:20) tr(cid:16) 1

4f 2

  1

4cf f (cid:17) + 1

2ht(cid:21) ,

(5)

where t is the stress-energy tensor of the n = 4 sym theory. consider, for instance,
absorption of a dilaton incident on the 3-brane at right angles with a low energy .
since the dilaton couples to tr f 2
 it can be converted into a pair of back-to-back
gluons on the world volume. the leading order calculation of the cross-section for
weak coupling gives [22]

23n 2

(6)
where  = 8g is the 10-dimensional gravitational constant (note that the factor n 2
comes from the degeneracy of the nal states which is the number of dierent gluon
species). this result was compared with the absorption cross-section by the extremal
3-brane geometry,

this geometry may be viewed as a semi-innite throat which for r  l opens up into
at 9 + 1 dimensional space. waves incident from the r  l region partly reect back
and partly penetrate into the the throat region r  l. the relevant s-wave radial
equation turns out to be [22]

two asymptotic regions. the low-energy behavior of the tunneling probability may be
calculated by the so-called matching method, and the resulting absorption cross-section
is [22]

su gra =

3l8 .

(9)

in order to compare (6) and (9) we need a relation between the radius of the throat,
l, and the number of d3-branes, n. such a relation follows from equating the adm
tension of the extremal 3-brane solution to n times the tension of a single d3-brane,
and one nds [20]

l4 =


25/2 n .

(10)

substituting this into (9), we nd that the supergravity absorption cross-section agrees
exactly with the d-brane one, without any relative factor like 3/4.

this result was a major surprise to me, and i started searching for its explanation.
the most important question is: what is the range of validity of the two calculations?
since   gst2, (10) gives l4  ngst2. supergravity can only be trusted if the
length scale of the 3-brane solution is much larger than the string scale , i.e. for
ngst  1.3 of course, the incident energy also has to be small compared to 1/.

thus, the supergravity calculation should be valid in the double-scaling limit [22]

(11)

if the description of the black 3-brane by a stack of many coincident d3-branes is
correct, and we presume that it is, then it must agree with the supergravity results in
this limit. since gst  g2
ym, this corresponds to the limit of innite t hooft coupling
in the n = 4 u(n) sym theory. since we also want to send gst  0 in order to
suppress the string loop corrections, we necessarily have to take the large n limit. to
summarize, the supergravity calculations are expected to give exact information about
the n = 4 sym theory in the limit of large n and large t hooft coupling [22].

coming back to the entropy problem, we now see that the bekenstein-hawking
ymn   limit of the theory, while the free eld
ymn  0 limit. thus, the relative factor of 3/4 is not a
it relates two dierent limits of the theory. indeed, on general grounds

entropy calculation applies to the g2

we expect that in the t hooft large n limit the entropy is given by [28]

(12)

3a similar conclusion applies to the strominger-vafa black hole [15].

the function f is certainly not constant: for example, a recent two-loop calculation
[29] shows that its perturbative expansion is

f (g2

ymn) = 1

(13)

thus, the bekenstein-hawking entropy in supergravity, (3), is translated into the pre-
diction that f (g2
ymn  ) = 3/4. in fact, a recent string theory calculation of the
leading strong coupling correction gives [28]

although we have sharpened the region of applicability of the supergravity calcula-
tion (9), we have not yet explained why it agrees with the leading order perturbative
result (6) on the d3-brane world volume. after including the higher-order sym cor-
rections, the general structure of the absorption cross-section in the large n limit is
expected to be [24]

where

(15)

a(g2

ymn) = 1 + b1g2

ymn + b2(g2

ymn)2 + . . .

for agreement with supergravity, the strong t hooft coupling limit of a(g2
ymn) should
be equal to 1 [24]. in fact, a stronger result is true: all perturbative corrections vanish
and a = 1 independent of the coupling. this was rst shown explicitly in [24] for the
graviton absorption. the absorption cross-section is related to the imaginary part of
the two-point function ht(p)t(p)i in the sym theory. in turn, this is determined
by a conformal central charge which satises a non-renormalization theorem:
it is
completely independent of the t hooft coupling.

in general, the two-point function of a gauge invariant operator in the strongly cou-
pled sym theory may be read o from the absorption cross-section for the supergravity
eld which couples to this operator in the world volume action [24]. some examples of
this eld operator correspondence may be read o from (5). thus, we learn that the
dilaton absorption cross-section measures the imaginary part of htr f 2
(p)i,
the ramond-ramond scalar absorption cross-section measures the imaginary part of
htr f f (p) tr f f (p)i, etc. the agreement of these two-point functions with
the weak-coupling calculations performed in [22, 23] is explained by supersymmetric
non-renormalization theorems. thus, the proposition that the g2
ymn   limit of the
large n n = 4 sym theory can be extracted from the 3-brane of type iib supergravity
has passed its rst consistency checks.

3 the ads/cft correspondence

the circle of ideas reviewed in the previous section received a seminal development
by maldacena [3] who also connected it for the rst time with the qcd string idea.
maldacena made a simple and powerful observation that the universal region of the
3-brane geometry, which should be directly identied with the n = 4 sym theory, is
the throat, i.e. the region r  l.4 the limiting form of the metric (7) is

ds2 =

l2

z2 (cid:16)dt2 + d~x2 + dz2(cid:17) + l2d2

5 ,

(16)

where z = l2
r  l. this metric describes the space ads5  s5 with equal radii of
curvature l. one also nds that the self-dual 5-form ramond-ramond eld strength
has constant ux through this space (the eld strength term in the einstein equation
eectively gives a positive cosmological constant on s5 and a negative one on ads5).
thus, maldacena conjectured that type iib string theory on ads5  s5 should be
somehow dual to the large n n = 4 sym theory.

maldacenas argument was based on the fact that the low-energy (  0) limit may
be taken directly in the 3-brane geometry and is equivalent to the throat (r  0) limit.
another way to motivate the identication of the gauge theory with the throat is to
think about the absorption of massless particles considered in the previous section. in
the d-brane description, a particle incident from the asymptotic innity is converted
into an excitation of the stack of d-branes, i.e. into an excitation of the gauge theory
on the world volume.
in the supergravity description, a particle incident from the
asymptotic (large r) region tunnels into the r  l region and produces an excitation
of the throat. the fact that the two dierent descriptions of the absorption process
give identical cross-sections supports the identication of excitations of ads5 s5 with
the excited states of the n = 4 sym theory.

another strong piece of support for this identication comes from symmetry consid-
erations [3]. the isometry group of ads5 is so(2, 4), and this is also the conformal
in addition we have the isometries of s5 which form
group in 3 + 1 dimensions.
su(4)  so(6). this group is identical to the r-symmetry of the n = 4 sym theory.
after including the fermionic generators required by supersymmetry, the full isometry
supergroup of the ads5  s5 background is su(2, 2|4), which is identical to the n = 4
superconformal symmetry. we will see that in theories with reduced supersymmetry
the compact s5 factor becomes replaced by other compact spaces x5, but ads5 is the
universal factor present in the dual description of any large n cft and realizing
the so(2, 4) conformal symmetry. one may think of these backgrounds as type iib
theory compactied on x5 down to 5 dimensions. such kaluza-klein compactications

4 related ideas were also pursued in [30].

9

of type iib supergravity were extensively studied in the mid-eighties [31, 32, 33], and
special attention was devoted to the ads5  s5 solution because it is a maximally
supersymmetric background [34, 35]. it is remarkable that these early works on com-
pactication of type iib theory were actually solving large n gauge theories without
knowing it.

as maldacena has emphasized, however, it is important to go beyond the supergrav-
ity limit and think of the ads5x5 space as a background of string theory [3]. indeed,
type iib strings are dual to the electric ux lines in the gauge theory, and this provides
a natural set-up for calculating correlation functions of the wilson loops. furthermore,
if n is sent to innity while g2
ymn is held xed and nite, then there are nite string
scale corrections to the supergravity limit [3, 4, 5] which proceed in powers of



l2  (cid:16)g2

ymn(cid:17)1/2

.

(17)

if we wish to study nite n, then there are also string loop corrections in powers of

2
l8  n 2 .

(18)

as expected, taking n to innity enables us to take the classical limit of the string
theory on ads5  x5. however, in order to understand the large n gauge theory with
nite t hooft coupling, we should think of the ads5  x5 as the target space of a 2-
dimensional sigma model describing the classical string physics [4]. the fact that after
the compactication on x5 the string theory is 5-dimensional supports polyakovs idea
[8]. in ads5 the fth dimension is related to the radial coordinate and, after a change
of variables z = le/l, the sigma model action turns into a special case of the general
ansatz proposed in [8],

i =

1

2 z d2[(i)2 + a2()(ix )2 + . . .] ,

(19)

where a() = e/l.
it is clear, however, that the string sigma models dual to the
gauge theories are of rather peculiar nature. the new feature revealed by the d-brane
approach, which is also a major stumbling block, is the presence of the ramond-
ramond background elds. little is known to date about such 2-dimensional eld
theories and, in spite of recent new insights [36], an explicit solution is not yet available.

3.1 correlation functions and the bulk/boundary correspon-

dence

maldacenas work provided a crucial insight that the ads5  s5 throat is the part
of the 3-brane geometry that is most directly related to the n = 4 sym theory.

10

it is important to go further, however, and explain precisely in what sense the two
should be identied and how physical information can be extracted from this duality.
major strides towards answering these questions were made in two subsequent papers
[4, 5] where essentially identical methods for calculating correlation functions of various
operators in the gauge theory were proposed. as we mentioned in section 2.2, even prior
to [3] some information about the eld/operator correspondence and about the two-
point functions had been extracted from the absorption cross-sections. the reasoning
of [4] was a natural extension of these ideas.

one may motivate the general method as follows. when a wave is absorbed, it
tunnels from the asymptotic innity into the throat region, and then continues to
propagate toward smaller r. let us separate the 3-brane geometry into two regions:

r > l and r < l. for r < l the metric is approximately that of ads5  s5, while
for r > l it becomes very dierent and eventually approaches the at metric. signals
coming in from large r may be thought of as disturbing the boundary of ads5 at
r  l, and then propagating into the bulk. this suggests that, if we discard the r > l
part of the 3-brane metric, then we have to cut o the radial coordinate of ads5 at
r  l, and the gauge theory correlation functions are related to the response of the
string theory to boundary conditions. guided by this idea, [4] proposed to identify
the generating functional of connected correlation functions in the gauge theory with
the extremum of the classical string action subject to the boundary conditions that
(x, z) = b(x) at z = l (at z =  all uctuations are required to vanish):5

w [b(x)] = sb(x) .

(20)

w generates the connected greens functions of the gauge theory operator that corre-
sponds to the eld  in the sense explained in section 2.2, while sb(x) is the extremum
of the classical string action subject to the boundary conditions. an essentially iden-
tical prescription was also proposed in [5] with a somewhat dierent motivation. if
we are interested in the correlation functions at innite t hooft coupling, then the
problem of extremizing the classical string action reduces to solving the equations of
motion in type iib supergravity whose form is known explicitly [34]. note that from
the point of view of the metric (16) the boundary conditions are imposed not at z = 0
(which would be a true boundary of ads5) but at some nite value z = zcutof f . it
does not matter which value it is since it can be changed by an overall rescaling of the
coordinates (z, x) which leaves the metric unchanged. the physical meaning of this
cut-o is that it acts as a uv cut-o in the gauge theory [4, 37]. indeed, the radial
coordinate of ads5 is to be thought of as the eective energy scale of the gauge theory
[3], and decreasing z corresponds to increasing energy. in some calculations one may

5 as usual, in calculating the correlation functions in a cft it is convenient to carry out the
euclidean continuation. on the string theory side we then have to use the euclidean version of ads5.

11

remove the cut-o from the beginning and specify the boundary conditions at z = 0,
but in others the cut-o is needed at intermediate stages and may be removed only at
the end [38].

there is a growing literature on explicit calculations of correlation functions following
the proposal of [4, 5]. in these notes we will limit ourselves to a brief discussion of
the 2-point functions. their calculations show that the dimensions of gauge invariant
operators are determined by the masses of the corresponding elds in ads5 [4, 5]. for
scalar operators this relation is

 = 2 +q4 + (ml)2 .

(21)

therefore, the operators in the n = 4 large n sym theory naturally break up into
two classes: those that correspond to the kaluza-klein states of supergravity and
those that correspond to massive string states. since the radius of the s5 is l, the
masses of the kaluza-klein states are proportional to 1/l. thus, the dimensions of the
corresponding operators are independent of l and therefore independent of g2
ymn. on
the gauge theory side this is explained by the fact that the supersymmetry protects
the dimensions of certain operators from being renormalized: they are completely
determined by the representation under the superconformal symmetry [39, 40]. all
families of the kaluza-klein states, which correspond to such bps protected operators,
were classied long ago [35].

on the other hand, the masses of string excitations are m2 = 4n

 where n is an integer.
for the corresponding operators the formula (21) predicts that the dimensions do de-
pend on the t hooft coupling and, in fact, blow up for large g2
.
this is a highly non-trivial prediction of the ads/cft duality which has not yet been
veried on the gauge theory side.

ymn as 2(cid:16)ngym2n(cid:17)1/2

it is often stated that the gauge theory lives on the boundary of ads5. a more
precise statement is that the gauge theory corresponds to the entire ads5, with the
eective energy scale measured by the radial coordinate. in this correspondence the
bare (uv) quantities in the gauge theory are indeed specied at the boundary of
ads5. in calculating the correlation functions it is crucial that the boundary values
of various elds in ads5 act as the sources in the gauge theory action which couple
to gauge invariant operators as in (5). a similar connection arises in the calculation
of wilson loop expectation values [41]. a wilson loop is specied by a contour in
x space placed at z = zcutof f . one then looks for a minimal area surface in ads5
bounded by this contour and evaluates the nambu action i0 which is proportional to
the area. the semiclassical value of the wilson loop is then ei0. this prescription,
which is motivated by the duality between fundamental strings and electric ux lines,
gives interesting results which are consistent with the conformal invariance [41]. for
ymn /|~x|. note that this strong

example, the quark-antiquark potential scales as qg2

12

coupling result is dierent from the weak coupling limit where we have v  g2

ymn/|~x|.

3.2 conformal eld theories and einstein manifolds

as we mentioned above, the duality between strings on ads5  s5 and the n = 4
sym is naturally generalized to dualities between strings on ads5  x5 and other
conformal gauge theories. the 5-dimensional compact space x5 is required to be a
postively curved einstein manifold, i.e. one for which r = g with  > 0. the
number of supersymmetries in the dual gauge theory is determined by the number of
killing spinors on x5.

the simplest examples of x5 are the orbifolds s5/ where  is a discrete subgroup of
so(6) [42, 43]. in these cases x5 has the local geometry of a 5-sphere. the dual gauge
theory is the ir limit of the world volume theory on a stack of n d3-branes placed at
the orbifold singularity of r6/. such theories typically involve product gauge groups
su(n)k coupled to matter in bifundamental representations [44].

constructions of the dual gauge theories for einstein manifolds x5 which are not
locally equivalent to s5 are also possible. the simplest example is the romans com-
pactication on x5 = t 1,1 = (su(2)  su(2))/u(1) [32, 45]. it turns out that the
dual gauge theory is the conformal limit of the world volume theory on a stack of
n d3-branes placed at the singularity of a certain calabi-yau manifold known as the
conifold. this turns out to be the n = 1 superconformal eld theory with gauge group
su(n)  su(n) coupled to two chiral superelds in the (n, n) representation and
two chiral superelds in the (n, n) representation [45]. this theory has an exactly
marginal quartic superpotential which produces a critical line related to the radius of
ads5  t 1,1.

4 towards non-conformal gauge theories in four

dimensions

in the preceding sections i hope to have convinced the reader that type iib strings
on ads5  x5 shed genuinely new light on four-dimensional conformal gauge theories.
while many insights have already been achieved, i am convinced that a great deal
remains to be learned in this domain. we should not forget, however, that the prize
question is whether this duality can be extended to qcd or at least to other gauge
theories which exhibit the asymptotic freedom and connement.
it is immediately
clear that this will not be easy because, as we remarked in section 3, a string approach
to weakly coupled gauge theory has not yet been fully developed (the well-understood
supergravity limit describes gauge theory with very large t hooft coupling). on the

13

other hand, the asymptotic freedom makes the coupling approach zero in the uv region
[46]. nevertheless, there may be some at least qualitative approaches to non-conformal
gauge theories that shed light on the essential physical phenomena.

one such approach, proposed by witten [47], builds on the observation that thermal
gauge theories are described by near-extremal p-brane solutions [20, 21].
it is also
known that the high temperature limit of a supersymmetric gauge theory in p + 1
dimensions is described by non-supersymmetric gauge theory in p dimensions. thus,
3-dimensional non-supersymmetric gauge theory is dual to the throat region of the
near-extremal 3-brane solution which turns out to have the geometry of a black hole
in ads5 [47] (similar black holes were studied long ago by hawking and page [48]).
similarly, 4-dimensional non-supersymmetric gauge theory is dual to the near-horizon
region of the near-extremal 4-brane solution [47]. witten calculated the wilson loop
expectation values in these geometries and showed that they satisfy the area law.
furthermore, calculations of the glueball masses produce discrete spectra with strong
resemblance to the lattice simulations [49]. unfortunately, this supergravity model
has some undesirable features as well: for example, the presence in the geometry of a
large 8  p dimensional sphere introduces into the spectrum families of light kaluza-
klein glueballs which are certainly absent from the lattice results. presumably, the
root of the problems is that the bare t hooft coupling is taken to be large, while in
order to achieve the conventional continuum limit it has to be sent to zero along a
renormalization group trajectory.

a pessimistic conclusion would be that little more can be done at present because
the supergravity approximation is supposed to be poor at weak t hooft coupling.
nevertheless, i feel that one should not give up attempts to understand the asymp-
totic freedom on the string side of the duality. in fact, some progress in this direction
was recently achieved in [50, 51, 52] following polyakovs suggestion [53] on how to
break supersymmetry without turning on the temperature. polyakov argued that a
string dual of non-supersymmetric gauge theory should have world sheet supersym-
metry without space-time supersymmetry. examples of such theories include the type
0 strings, which are nsr strings with a non-chiral gso projection which breaks the
space-time supersymmetry [54].

there are two type 0 theories, a and b, and both have no space-time fermions
in their spectra but produce modular invariant partition functions [54]. the massless
bosonic elds are as in the corresponding type ii theory (a or b), but with the doubled
set of the ramond-ramond (r-r) elds. the type 0 theory also contains a tachyon,
which is why it has not received much attention thus far. in [53, 50] it was suggested,
however, that the presence of the tachyon does not spoil its application to large n
gauge theories. a well-established route towards gauge theory is via the d-branes
which were rst considered in the type 0 context in [55]. large n gauge theories,

14

which are constructed on n coincident d-branes of type 0 theory, may be shown to
contain no open string tachyons [50, 53].

in [50] the presence of a bulk tachyon was turned into an advantage because it gives
rise to the renormalization group ow. there the 3 + 1 dimensional su(n) theory
coupled to 6 adjoint massless scalars was constructed as the low-energy description
of n coincident electric d3-branes of type 0b theory.6 the conjectured dual type 0
background thus carries n units of electric 5-form ux. the dilaton decouples from
the (f5)2 terms in the eective action, and the only source for it originates from the
tachyon mass term,

2 = 1

8m2e

2 t 2 ,

m2 =  2
 .

(22)

thus, the tachyon background induces a radial variation of . since the radial coordi-
nate is related to the energy scale of the gauge theory, the eective coupling decreases
toward the ultraviolet. in [51, 52] the uv limit of the type 0b background dual to the
gauge theory was studied in more detail and a solution was found where the geome-
try is ads5  s5 while the t hooft coupling ows logarithmically. calculation of the
quark-antiquark potential showed qualitative agreement with what is expected in an
asymptotically free theory.

these results raise the hope that the ads/cft duality can indeed be generalized
to asymptotically free gauge theories. while we are still far from constructing reliable
string duals of such theories, the availability of new ideas on this old and dicult
problem makes me hopeful that more surprises lie ahead.
