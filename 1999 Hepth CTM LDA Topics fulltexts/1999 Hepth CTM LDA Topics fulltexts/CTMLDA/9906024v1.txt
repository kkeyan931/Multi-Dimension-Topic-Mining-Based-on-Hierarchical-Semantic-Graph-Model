in this paper we discuss two approaches to anomaly-free quantization of a two-dimensional string.
the rst approach is based on the canonical dirac prescription of quantization of degenerated systems.
at the second approach we weaken the dirac quantization conditions requiring the solving of rst class
constraints only in the sense of mean values. at both approaches there are no states with the indenite
metrics.

1. introduction

the quantum theory of gravity in four-dimensional space-time encounters fundamental diculties,
which now are not overcome. these diculties can be divided on conceptual and computing. the main
conceptual problem is that the hamiltonian is a linear combination of a rst class constrains. this fact
makes unclear a role of time in gravitaty. the main computing problem consists in nonrenormalizability
of the theory of gravity. the pointed diculties are closely bound. for example, an anomaly (central
charge) can be present or absent in algebra of rst class constraints depending on computing procedure.
in turn the presence or absence of anomaly in algebra of the rst class constraints crucially inuences on
the resulting physical picture.

the listed fundamental problems are solved successfully for rather simple models of generally covariant
theories in two-dimensional space-time. both two-dimensional gravity and string theories belong to such
models (see, for example [1-4] and reference there).

in the present work we develop ideology and technique of anomaly-free quantization of two-dimensional
string. the hamiltonian of a two-dimensional bosonic string actually coincides with hamiltonian of
two-dimensional pure gravity expressed in certain special variables [1,2]. the dierence between two-
dimensional string and two-dimensional gravity is that in the theory of two-dimensional string there is an
additional external symmetry relative to abelian lorentz group in two-dimensional space-time. however,
the ideological basis of anomaly-free quantization in both models is identical. we explain this idea, using
a material of works [1,2,4].

lets consider in two-dimensional space-time the following system of constraints:

e0 =

1

2 (cid:16) (0)2 + (r0 

e = e0 + e1  0 ,
1
)2(cid:17) ,

e1 =
0 + r1

p = ra a = r0

2 (cid:16) (1)2 + (r1
1  0

)2(cid:17) ,

(1.1a)

(1.1b)

here we use dimensionless values, ra(x) and a(x)), a = 0, 1 are canonically conjugated elds on a
one-dimensional manyfold, so the nonzero commutational relations look like

[ra(x), b(y) ] = i a

b (x  y)

(1.2)

the prime or overdot mean the derivatives /x or /t, respectively.

now we must determine the ground state of the theory.

it allows to perform normal ordering of
the operators in the constraints (1.1). the normal ordering in the constraints can result to anomalies
in the commutators of the constraints. these anomalies partially destroy the weak equalities (1.1). to
determine the ground state, the elds ra and a are expanded in the modes which arise when solving the
heisenberg equations

i ra = [ ra, h ] ,

i a = [ a, h ] ,

h = z dxe

the solution of the equations (1.2), (1.3) can be written in the form

ra(t, x) = z dk

a(t, x) = i z dk

from commutational relatons (1.5) immediately follows, that

| k, ai = ca+

h | k, ai = (|k| + e0 )| k, ai ,

(1, 7)

(1.8)

where e0 is the value of the operator h for the ground state. the equality (1.8) implies the operator
h is positively dened.

in consequence of (1.4) and (1.6) we have for scalar product of vectors (1.7):

now we see that the metrics in complete space of states is indenite.

h k, a| p, b i = 2  ab (k  p)

terms:

lets calculate the commutator [e, p ], which can be represented according to (1.1) as a sum of two
(1.10)

1(x) ]

[e(x), p(y) ] = [e0(x), r0

0(y) ] + [e1(x), r1

according to (1.2) the both commutators in the right hand side of eqs.(1.10) coincide up to replacement
of index a. these commutators are proportional (up to the ordering) to quantities e0 and e1
,
respectively. the normal ordering of the operators in considered commutators, as is known, results in
anomalies.

k ) and (c1+

k  c1+

as is known, in such case the normal and antinormal orderings result in anomalies diering only in
sign. hence, the contribution of the rst commutator in anomaly in the right hand side of eq.(1.10) will
be (a) and of the second commutator will be (a). but as in front of the rst commutator in (1.10)
there is a sign  minus , the anomaly in (1.10) is equal (a) + a = 2 a.

now we pass to another point of view.
in the work [1] jackiw states that the condition (1.8) of positivity of operator h is not necessary in
the considered theory. the initial requirement of the theory is that the weak equalities (1.1) are valid.
therefore we can refuse the conditions of quantization (1.6) and replace them by the following:

under the quantization conditions (1.11) the bases of complete fock space of the theory consists of

the following vectors:

c0+
k | 0 i = 0 ,

c1
k | 0 i = 0

(1.11)

k1 . . . c0
c0

km c1+

p1 . . . c1+

pn | 0 i

(1.12)

from the commutational relations (1.4) it follows that the scalar product of states (1.12) is positively

dened. moreover, in the algebra of the operators (1.1) there is no anomaly.

k , c1

indeed, under conditions (1.11) the normal ordering consists in arrangement of the operators (c0

k, c1+
k )
on the left of all operators (c0+
k ). it means the normal ordering in both heisenberg algebras h0 and
h1 . now at the normal ordering the both commutators in (1.10) give in anomaly the same contribution,
which is equal to a. since in front of the rst commutator in the right hand side of eq.(1.10) there is a
sign minus the complete anomaly appears equal to a + a = 0.
e  0 , p  0. in [1] two physical states annulating the all operators e and p are given:

(e, p ) enables to satisfy all weak equalities

the absence of anomaly in algebra of the operators

gravity(ra) = exp

i

2 z dx ab ra rb

in [2,4] the continuous families of states parametrized by one real parameter which solve the all

constraints (1.1) are also considered.

in this work we reconsider the well known quantization conditions for relativistic bosonic string in two-
dimensional space - time. as a result we formulate two another approaches to quantizarion of considered

model. the both approaches lead to the virasoro algebra in which the central charge is absent. we
use complete space of states with the positively dened scalar product. the complete space of states
is decomposed to tensor product of physical states space and gauge states spaces. such decomposition
make possible a calculation of matrix elements for dynamic variables separately relative to physical
states and states describing gauge degrees of freedom. this fact allows to change the dirac quantization
prescription for systems containing the rst class constraints [5]. the arising quantization rule can be
useful for quatization of more complicated degenerated systems for example such as four-dimensional
gravity.

2. relativistic bosonic string
in two-dimensional space-time

let x   = 0, 1 be the coordinates in two-dimensional minkovski space. consider the nambu

action for bosonic string:

s = 

1

l2 z g d2 = z d l

(2.1)

here a = (, ) are the parameters of the world sheet of the string and

g = det gab

gab = 

x 
a

x 
b

the parameter 
is time like and  is spacial. next the partial derivatives / and / will
be denoted by an over dot and a prime, respectively. it is easy to show, that the generalized momenta
 = l/ x  satisfy the conditions:

l2
2

e =

  +

1
2 l2 x  x 

  0 ,

(2.2)
the quantities e() and p() exhaust the all rst class constraints. the hamiltonian of the system

p = x    0

h = z d    l  0

is also equal to zero.

therefore, following to dirac, we must use the generalized hamiltonian which is an arbitrary linear

combination of the rst class constraints (2.2):

ht = z d (v p + w e)

the equations of motion can be obtained with the help of the variational principle

 s =  {z d (z d  x   ht )} = 0

(2.3)

(2.4)

in the case of an open string, when the parameter  changes from zero to  , the variational principle
(2.4) gives besides the equations of motion the boundary conditions

 )|=0,  = 0
usually the boundary conditions (2.5) are replaced by conditions

(v  + w

1
l2 x 

for the closed string instead of the boundary condition there is the periodicity condition.

further we consider an open string.

v|=0,  = 0 ,

x 
|=0,  = 0

(2.5)

(2.6)

the rst step of quantization consists in denition of commutational relations for generalized coordi-

nates and momenta:

the commutational relations (2.7) and the boundary conditions (2.6) are satised if

[ x (), () ] = i  (  )

x () =

l



x + i xn6=0
 l xn

1

() =

1
n



n cos n
 ,



n cos n

and the elements (x, 

n) satisfy the following commutational relations:

[ x, 

n ] = i  n ,

[ x, x ] = 0 ,

[ 

m, 

n ] = m  m+n

since the quantities (2.8) are real then

the constraints (2.2) can be represented as follows:

x+ = x ,

n = 
+
n

where

(e  p)() =

1
2

(

())2 ,


() =

1

 xn


n expi n 

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

from here it is seen, that e p is obtained from e +p by replacement   . this fact simplies
the further analysis, as the quantity e + p in interval      contains the information about
quantities e  p in interval 0    . therefore the fourier components

ln =

1

2 z 



d (e + p) exp i n 

are equivalent to the set of quantities (2.2) at 0    . according to (2.11) - (2.13) we have

ln =

1
2

: xm



nm  m :

the sense of the ordering operation in (2.14) is dened by a method of quantization.

lets write out also the expressions for momentum and angular momentum of the string:

p  = z 

0

d  ,

j  = z 

0

d (x    x  )

with the help of (2.6) and (2.7) we can directly verify, that

[ p , ht ] = 0 ,

[ j , ht ] = 0

it means, that the momentum and angular momentum of the string are conserved.

under standard quantization the ground state | 0 i satises the conditions


m | 0 i = 0 ,
the complete space of states has the orthogonal basis:

m  0

m1 . . . s
1

ms | 0 i ,

mi < 0

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

thus, the all 

m are linear operators in complete space of states. from (2.9) and (2.16) it follows,
that the metrics in the space of states (2.17) is indenite. the ordering in (2.14) means, that the operators

n with n  0. the such ordering results
in the virasoro algebra contains the anomalies:

m with m < 0 are placed on the left of the all operators 

[ ln, lm ] = (n  m) ln+m +

1
12

d(n3  n)

(2.18)

here d is the dimension of x - space. in our case d = 2 . therefore the annihilation of the operators
ln with n  0 is maximum, that can be reached. as a result the theory is self-consistent only for
d = 26. the detailed study of problems, arising under the quantization (2.16), can be found in [4].
now we shall state the way of quantization of two-dimensional string, which results in the self-
consistent string theory [1-4]. this quantization method of the string is similar to the quantization
method applied by dirac to electromagnetic eld (see. [7], and also appendix).

lets introduce the designations

from (2.9) we obtain:

x = x0  x1 ,

[(+)

m , (+)

n ] = [()

m , ()

n ] = 0 ,

m = 0

[x+, (+)

n ] = [x, ()

[x, (+)

n ] = 0 ,
n ] = 2i n

lets write out the virasoro operators in variables ():

ln = 

1

2 xm

(+)
nm ()

m

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

by denition the ordering in (2.21) means either the elements (+) are arranged on the left of the
all elements () or the elements () are arranged on the left of the all elements (+). both these
orderings are equivalent. indeed

it is possible to consider the last sum as equal to zero, since it is represented in the form (1) (1),
where (s) is the rieman zeta-function. as is known the zeta-function

(s) 



xn=1

ns

(2.22)

has the unique analytical continuation to the point s = 1 and (1) = 1/12.
variables of the system act as linear operators.

the following problem consists in the denition of vector space of states, in which the dynamic

in the beginning we apply the dirac prescription for quantization of our model, marking the chosen
way by the index d. we represent the complete space of states hcd as the tensor product of the
gauge space of states hg and physical space of states hp d:

hcd = hg  hp d

(2.23)

the space hg is generated by its vacuum vector

properties:

0
m | 0; gi = 0 , 1

m | 0; gi = 0 , m > 0 ,

| 0; gi, which is determined by the following
(2.24)

h 0; g| 0; gi = 1

the basis of the space hg consists of vectors of the form

thus, hg is the fock space with positively dened scalar product.

m1 . . . 0
0

ms 1

n1 . . . 1

nr | 0; gi , mi > 0 , ni > 0

(2.25)

the basis in the dirac physical space of states hp d consists of two series | k id with the following

properties ( ()

0  p ):

p+ | k id = 2k | k id ,
()
m | k id = 0 , (+)

p | k+ id = 2k | k+ id ,
m | k+ id = 0 , m = 0, 1, . . .

(2.26)

(2.27)

and

(2.28)
here k is continuous real parameter, 0 < k < +. the quantization conditions (2.27) were applied in
works [2,4]. earlier the similar quantization conditions were applied by dirac in electrodynamics [7].
from the given denitions it is seen, that in complete space of states the scalar product is positively

h k  | k id = k (k  k ) ,

h k  | k+ id = 0

dened.

lets emphasize, that variables 

n , n 6= 0, being the linear operators in space hg, are not operators
on the vectors | k+ id, and also action of the
on the vectors | k id is not dened, if n 6= 0. nevertheless from the given denitions
n with

in the space hp d. indeed, the action of the variables ()
variables (+)
it follows, that the action of some combinations (generally speaking, nonlinear) of the variables 
n 6= 0 in the space hp d is determined correctly. for example, owing to (2.20) and (2.27), we have:

n

n

m ()
(+)

m | k+ id = 2m| k+id , ()

m (+)

m | k id = 2m| k id

since

ln = 

1

2 xm

nm ()

m =

2 xm

()
nm (+)
m ,

and as the consequence of (2.27) the equalities

ln | p id = 0 ,

| p id  hp d

(2.29)

(2.30)

take place. thus, all physical states are annihilated by the all virasoro operators. the equalities (2.30)
mean, that under quantization (2.24) - (2.28) the virasoro algebra has no anomaly.

[ln, lm ] = (n  m) ln+m

(2.31)

here we have a situation, which is common for all degenerated systems. in degenerated systems there is a
set of rst class constraints m. if evident resolution of these constraints is inexpedient, then according
to dirac prescription the following conditions

m | p id = 0

(2.32)

are imposed on the physical states. it is obvious, that owing to (2.32) the physical states can not depend
on gauge degrees of freedom, the changes of which are generated by the constraints m. thus the
variables, describing the gauge degrees of freedom can not be , generally speaking, the linear operators
in the space of physical states. on the other hand, according to dirac prescription it is necessary to
consider only the physical states.

lets consider on an example of investigated model the paradox which arise when the dirac procedure
is realized. we have a set of the oscillator variables 
m , m 6= 0, and also the coordinate and momentum
variables (x, p ). under the schrodinger quantization the complete space of states hc is decomposed
to the tensor product of the spaces hg and hp : hc = hg  hp . here the space hg is as in (2.24)
- (2.25).
the space hp in the schrodinger representation is, for example, the space of functions of two variables
(x0, x1 ), on which there is a positively determined lorentz - invariant scalar product. by this denition
in the space hp there are no states which are annihilated by the operators ()
m , m 6= 0. moreover,
also in complete space hc there are no states which are annihilated by the operators ()
m , m 6= 0.
one can add to the space hg the states | i, on which the operators ()
m are equal to zero. in the

extended space we shall dene the scalar product as follows:

h | i = 1 ,

h + | i = 0 ,

further we dene

where

h | gi = 0 ,

| gi  hg

| k id = | i  | k i ,

(2.33)

| k i  hp ,

p | k i = 2k | k i
then the set of vectors { | k id} form the basis of the space hp d.
lets pay attention to the reason by which the parameter k in (2.27), (2.28) and (2.34) is positive.
this follows from the requirement of a positivity of scalar product in the space hp . indeed, the space
hp is the space of states of a massless bose-particle. as is well known (see [8], chapter 3, 2) in such
space the positively dened and lorentz - invariant scalar product exists only for positive (or negative)
energies.

(2.34)

thus, the dirac prescription imply the variables 

normalizable space hc . but just in the space hc the initial variables 
bose creation and annihilation operators.

from above consideration it is seen, that any vector from the space hp d does not belong to initial
m , m 6= 0 are the well dened
m with m 6= 0 are not the operators in the
physical space hp d. the variables {
m , x } are generators of the associative noncommutative
m, x } satisfy
involutive algebra a with unit over the complex numbers (see [4]). the generators {
only the relations (2.9). the generators {x, p } are the operators in the space of physical states hp d.
in the space hp d there is the basis | k id, for which the relations (2.27) take place.
m with m 6= 0 are not the operators in the space of physical states. nevertheless, the
observable quantities can depend on these variables so, that the matrix elements of observable quantities
relative to vectors from the space of physical states are determined correctly. just such situation has a
place in quantum electrodynamics for dirac quantization [7] (see also appendix).

the variables 

lets continue the study of our model.
from the denitions (2.15) we obtain the following formulae:

(exp i j 01) ()

m (expi j 01) = (exp) ()
m ,
(exp i j 01) x (expi j 01) = (exp) x

and

here  and a are arbitrary real numbers. it is evident from eqs. (2.29) and (2.30) that translations
and lorentz transformations conserve the condition (2.23).

according to eq. (2.35)

p (expi j 01) = (exp ) (expi j 01) p

(2.37)

let us formally act with the equalities (2.37) on the states |ki, accordingly. as a result of eq. (2.26)
we obtain
(2.39)
the last equality makes it possible to determine the action of the operators (expij 01) on the physical
states as follows:

p (expi j 01)| k i = 2k e (expi j 01)| k i

(expi j 01)| k i = f 

 | (exp j 01)| k i

here f 
is dened in a lorentz-invariant manner according to (2.28) so |f 
that one can assume

 are some complex numbers dierent from zero. since the scalar product on physical state vectors
 | = 1. from eq. (2.39) it is evident
(2.40)

k > 0

according to eqs. (2.8) and (2.15)

l

p  =

2 l {(

1 ) p}

(exp iap ) x (expiap ) = x +

a


l
m (expiap ) = ()

m

(exp iap ) ()

(2.35)

(2.36)

therefore from (2.26) and (2.27) we obtain:

l

p  | k id =

k
 | k id ,

k
 = (k, k)

(2.41)

thus, as a result of the above-described quantization procedure of two-dimensional string there arises

a system similar to a massless quantum particle in two-dimensional space-time.

3. the other way of anomaly-free quantization

of a two-dimensional string.

in the previous section we have emphasized the diculties which arise under dirac quantization of

degenerated systems. these diculties in general are reduced to the following problems:

1) the problem of normalizability of physical state vectors.
2) the impossibility of interpretation of some initial dynamic variables as linear operators in the space

of physical states.

these problems are successfully solved in relatively simple models such as electrodynamics and two-
dimensional string. however, the complete solution of these problems in more complicated models such
as four dimensional gravity is extremely dicult.

we propose in this section the alternative way of quantization of a two-dimensional string. the idea
of this quantization consists in some weakening of the dirac conditions (2.32) by replacement them with
conditions:

h p | m | p ig = 0

(3.1)

here the index p number any physical state. the index g indicates that an averaging in (3.1) goes
only in gauge degrees of freedom. the quantization conditions (3.1) are similar in some sense a) to
the gupta-bleuler conditions in electrodynamics, when the equality a = 0 takes place only in the
sense of mean value; b) to the quantization conditions in the usual string theory, when the generators of
virasoro algebra satisfy conditions ln = 0 also only in the sense of mean value.

it is important that calculation of the mean value in (3.1) is performed relative to physical states.
the dierence of oered here quantization from gupta-bleuler and standard string quantizations is
that at our approach the scalar product in complete space of states is positively dened. it is shown
below, that this fact allows to carry out the anomaly-free quantization of a two-dimensional string.

insted of the dirac selfconsistency conditions [m, n ] = cl

mn l , now we have:

h p | [m, n ]| p ig = 0

(3.2)

explain the physical sense of the conditions (3.2). as is known hamiltonian of a generally covariant

system has the form ht = p vmm. assume, that at the moment of time t the conditions (3.1) take

place. in the innitely close moment of time t +  t the constraint n is equal to

n(t + t) = n(t) + i t xm

vm [m, n ](t)

thus the selfconsistency conditions (3.2) provide the equalities (3.1) at any moment of time.

we believe, that the complete space of states, in which the initial dynamic variables (2.9) - (2.10) act,

is the space hc , determined in the previous section:

hc = hg  hp

(3.3)

here the spaces hg and hp are dened according to (2.24), (2.25) and (2.34). let in the space hp
the basis | k i = | k0, k1 i be such, that

p | k i = k | k i

(3.4)

for the further calculations it is necessary to dene a suitable ordering of the operators. next we shall
use the ordering

l0 =

1
2

p p  xm>0

(0

m 0

m  1

m 1

m ) ,

(3.5)

which is equivalent to the ordering (2.21).

we think that in the examined model the most convenient physical states satisfying conditions (3.1),
are the states, which are coherent relative to gauge degrees of freedom. lets consider in the space hg
the coherent state

m , m 6= 0 are complex numbers. below we assume by denition that z

lets introduce a designation | z i for the state

m | z; gi ,

m | z; gi , m > 0

from (3.4), (3.7) and (3.8) it follows, that

| z i = | z; gi  | k i  hc

m | z i = z0
we call the set of complex numbers { z
and designated by | z ip , if its parameters satisfy the equations:

m | z i , m  0

m | z i = z1

further it is supposed, that all solutions of the equations (3.10) satisfy condition (3.11). therefore the
basis in the space hp can be given according to (2.34), and the scalar product according to (2.28).

from the formulas (3.5), (3.9), (3.10) it follows immediately, that in considered case the conditions

(3.1) take place:

lets verify the selfconsistency condition (3.2). in our case for this purpose it is enough to check up,

h z | ln | z ip = 0

(3.12)

that

the simple calculation shows:

h z | ( lnln  lnln )| z ip = 0

(3.16)

the ordering in the right hand side of eq.(3.16) is given according to (3.5). from (3.16) it is seen, that
the equalities (3.12) take place, so here the selfconsistency conditions (3.2) are valid.

note that, generally speaking,

let hamiltonian of the system be ht = pn vn ln, where vn( ) = vn( ). give the answer for the

question how the mean values of heisenberg variables change in time. the heisenberg equations look like

h z | lnln || z ip 6= 0

dene by following equations the system of complex time-dependent numbers:

m( ) [ k (k  k) ] = h z | 
z

m( )| z ip ,

(3.17)

(3.18)

where 
m( ) are the heisenberg variables. in eq.(3.18) we assume that the collections of parameters
0 = z
{z} and {z} are physical, that is they satisfy the equations (3.10). moreover z
0 .
obviously in this case h z | z i = k (k  k) . with the help of (3.17) and (3.18) we obtain the equations
for change in time of the parameters (3.18):

m if z

m = z

d

m( ) = m xn

vn( ) z

(3.19)

thus, the mean values of heisenberg dynamic variables satisfy the classical equations of motion.

now consider the question about the lorentz-invariancy of the theory. lets write the operator of the

angular momentum in the form:

j 01 = (x0p1  x1p0 ) +

i

2 xn6=0

1
n

(0

n1

n  1

n0

n )

(3.20)

from here we see that the action of the angular momentum operator on physical states is well dened.
let

| z ip = ( expi  j 01 )| z ip

(3.21)

since [lm, j 01 ] = 0 and operator j 01 is hermithian, the equations (3.12) and (3.13) take place as well
for the states (3.21). it means, that the states | z ip , determined according to (3.21) are physical states.
owing to (2.35) the both states | z ip and | z ip are the eigenstates for the momentum operator p.
the scalar product of physical states is conserved under the lorentz transformations (3.21):

h z

1 | z i = h z1 | z i

we shall calculate the mean values of dynamic variables variations generated by the angular momen-

tum operator. let for any variable o

o(l) = i  [o, j 01 ]

then for fundamental variables we have:

 x

(l) =  (1x0  0x1 ) ,

for variations of mean values (3.18) we nd:

 

m(l) =  (10

m  01
m )

 z

m(l) =  (1z0

m  0z1
m )

(3.22)

(3.23)

we see, that under lorentz transformation the corresponding transformation of observable variables
{x, p } occurs and also the gauge transformation of gauge degrees of freedom take place.
lets discuss shortly the superposition principle under the second quantization method.
assume, that the states | z ip and | z ip are physical. is the state

| z ip + | z ip

physical?

we think, that it is not necessary to extend the superposition principle to unphysical, gauge degrees
of freedom. therefore, if under the second quantization method the superposition principle will appear
limited in the space hg , in our opinion, it does not depreciate the method. however, in physical space
the superposition principle is kept completely.

4. conclusion.

the quantization methods which was applied to the two dimensional string in the sections 2, 3 next
we shall call as rst and second methods, accordingly. the results of this paper are reduced to the
following theses:

1) both methods lead to absence of the central charge in virasoro algebra. in both cases the basis

for such result is that in complete space of states the scalar product is positively dened.

2) the rst method successively realizes the dirac quantization prescription for degenerated systems.
in this case in the theory there are such dynamic variables, which are not the operators in physical
space of states. in simple models (two-dimensional string and electrodynamics) this fact is not impor-
tant since the matrix elements of observables relative to physical states are well dened and calculated
obviously. however, in the complicated theories such as four-dimensional gravity the specied diculty
can extremely complicate the decision of a problem, by ceasing to be in result only technical.

3) the second quantization method is based on some weakening of dirac quantization conditions for
degenerated systems. it enables to treat the all initial dynamic variables as the operators in physical space
of states. the physical space of states is a vector subspace of complete space of states with positively
dened scalar product. this statement is incorrect for the rst quantization method. the scalar product
in physical space of states is induced by scalar product in complete space of states.

4) the both quantizations result in isomorphic spaces of physical states. however, it is unknown,

whether this result will be kept in more complicated models.

5) the both quantizations result in the lorentz-invariant theories. note that in the conventional
quantization there exists a state which is invariant under lorentz transformations. this state is the
ground state.
in this respect the conventional string theory is similar to the standard quantum eld
theory of point objects. in such eld theories the ground state usually is lorentz-invariant. conversely,
in our approach there does not exist a state that is invariant under lorentz transformations. for this
reason, the quantum string theory proposed above is analogous to a quantum theory of a single relativistic
particle. in the letter case there does not exist a lorentz-invariant quantum state of a single relativistic
particle. for existence of lorentz-invariant state in our theory we would have to introduce a second-
quantized string eld. in such theory the ground state or vacuum would be lorentz-invariant.

it seems to us, that the second quantization method can give interesting results in application to more

complicated models.

here we describe the dirac quantization [7] of free electromagnetic field. this quantization method

is applied in section 2.

we have also

[ at
