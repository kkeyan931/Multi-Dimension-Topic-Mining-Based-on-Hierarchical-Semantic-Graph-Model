we consider the generating function (prepotential) for gromov-witten invariants of
rational elliptic surface. we apply the local mirror principle to calculate the prepotential
and prove a certain recursion relation, holomorphic anomaly equation, for genus 0 and 1.
we propose the holomorphic anomaly equation for all genera and apply it to determine
higher genus gromov-witten invariants and also the bps states on the surface. general-
izing gottsches formula for the hilbert scheme of g points on a surface, we nd precise
agreement of our results with the proposal recently made by gopakumar and vafa[11].

introduction

since the pioneering work by candelas et al.

in 1991[6], the theory of the gromov-
witten invariants has been one of the central topics in mathematical physics related to
string theory. due to many contributions on this subject we have now well-developed
mathematical theory[16][4] of the invariants as well as the concrete methods to calculate
them applying the mirror symmetry of calabi-yau manifolds. however up to very recently
our concrete methods have been restricted to the genus zero or genus one gromov-witten
invariants. although we have mathematical denition of the higher genus gromov-witten
invariants, little was known about how to determine them explicitly for a given calabi-yau
manifold. regarding this a breakthrough has been made recently in [18] for a special class
of calabi-yau manifolds which have a k3 bration and have a dual description in the
heterotic string. independently gopakumar and vafa[10][11] have derived a general form

of the prepotential for the higher genus gromov-witten invariants, which includes several
interesting mathematical predictions on the gromov-witten invariants.

in this paper we will propose a recursion relation holomorphic anomaly equation as a
basic equation for the higher genus gromov-witten invariants of rational elliptic surface,
and will make explicit predictions for them. we nd exquisite agreement of our results
with those by gopakumar and vafa.

to state main results of this paper let us consider a generic rational elliptic surface
obtained by blowing up nine base points of two generic cubics in p2. under the assumption
for the cubics the surface s has an elliptic bration over p1 with exactly twelve singular
bers of kodaira i1 type. we consider a situation in which the generic rational elliptic
surface s appears as a divisor in a calabi-yau 3-fold x. since the normal bundle nx/s is
given by the canonical bundle ks we can extract the genus g gromov-witten invariants
ng() of class   h2(s, z) taking a suitable limit of the prepotential of the calabi-
yau 3-fold x, which is called local mirror principle. since even for genus zero invariants
the determination of ng=0() is technically tedious, in what follows, we will mainly be
concerned with the following sum of the invariants

ng;d,n := x(,h)=d, (,f )=n

ng()

where h and f represent the pull back of the hyperplane class of p2 and the ber class,
respectively. associated to these invariants we dene generating functions;

zg;n(q) :=

xd=0

ng;d,nqd , fg(q, p) :=

zg;npn .

xn=0

the latter is the genus g prepotential in topological string theory. for g = 0 and g = 1
we determine it via the local mirror principle applying to x, and nd a recursion relation
satised by zg;n (g = 0, 1; n = 1, 2,   ) which we generalize for arbitrary g as follows:
conjecture 1.1 (holomorphic anomaly equation for all g) the generating function zg;n(q)
has the form

p2g+2n2(, e2, e4, e6) (z0;1(q))n

,

(1.1)

with some quasi-modular form for the modular subgroup (3) of weight 2g + 2n  2.
(in the special cases of g = 0 and n = 1,
it simplies to p2n2(e2, e4, e6) and
p2g(e2(q3), e4(q3), e6(q3)), i.e., exactly the quasi-modular forms of weight 2n  2 and
2g, respectively). and it satises the recursion relation

we may integrate our holomorphic anomaly equation under certain vanishing conditions.

to

which has been found in [15][14]. the e8 theta function comes from the mordell-weil
group of the rational elliptic surface and the eta functions in the denominator come from
the twelve singular bers. see [14] for the details and notations. then we nd that the
solutions zg;1 may be arranged into an all genus partition function of the topological string
theory:

(1.4)

we derive the same result following the proposal made in [11] for the bps state
counting of the families of genus g curves. from this viewpoint our result (1.4) comes from
the following generalization of gottsches formula[9] for the hilbert scheme s[g] of g points
on a surface s:
proposition 1.3 (gottsches formula with sl(2, c)l  sl(2, c)r lefschetz action) for
the hilbert scheme s[g] of g points on a surface s with a bration structure we can decom-
pose the lefschetz sl(2, c) action on h (s[g]) into the product sl(2, c)l  sl(2, c)r,
one for the natural ber space of s[g] and the other for the base space. if we write the
poincare polynomial by

ptl,tr(s[g]) = (tltr)gtrh (s[g])(t2j3,l

l

t2j3,r

) ,

b1(s) = 0, is given by

then the generating function g(tl, tr, q) = pg0 ptl,tr(s[g])qg, for the surface with
g(tl, tr,q) = yn1(cid:26)

(1.6)

this implies that the genus g curves cg in s satisfying (cg, f ) = 1 split into irreducible
parts, one coming from the mordell-weil group and the others from elliptic curves (with
possible nodal singularities) in the ber direction.

the readers who are not interested in the derivation and the proofs of the holomorphic
anomaly equation may omit the following two sections and may start from the section 4
for our main results.

the organization of this paper is as follows: in section 2, we will introduce a calabi-
yau hypersurface and its mirror, and introduce the hypergeometric series representing the
prepotential f0(t) for the calabi-yau hypersurface. in section 3, we will take a limit to
reduce the prepotential to the one relevant to the rational elliptic surface (, local mirror
principle). we will analyze the reduced prepotential and the mirror maps in detail, and will
prove the recursion relation, holomorphic anomaly equation at g = 0. using the formula
in [1] for f1, we will also prove the recursion relation at g = 1.
in section 4, we will
propose our recursion relation for all genera, and solve the recursion relation with some
vanishing conditions. there we also discuss about the gromov-witten invariants coming
from zg;1(q). in the nal section, we discuss some relations to the recent developments on
the counting problem of the bps states in topological string theory[11][15]. there we will
nd a generalization of gottsches formula for the poincare polynomials of s[g].

acknowledgments: two of the authors (s.h. and m.-h.s.) would like to thank n.yui
for her kind hospitality during their stay (august, 1998) at queens university where very
early stage of this work has been done. the research of s.h. and m.-h.s. is supported
in part by grant-in aid for science research (a-09740015 for s.h. and b-09440015 for
m.-h.s.), the ministry of education, science and culture, japan. the research of a.t. is
supported by research fellowships of japan society for the promotion for young scientists.
after our submission of this paper to the e-print archive, hep-th, we are informed by
a. klemm that he is testing the higher genus prepotentials fg for several surfaces other
than our rational elliptic surface (work to appear). we would like to thank him for sending
us his preliminary draft prior to publication.

note added in proof: in references [15] and [19], a dierent base f + e9, in stead of our
h, is used to dene zg=0;n. in this case we consider our generating function zg;n for the

invariants ng;d,n =p ng() summed over  with (, f + e9) = d, (, f ) = n. then our

conjecture 1.1 should be read as follows;

the generating function zg;n(q) has the form

p2g+6n2(e2, e4, e6)

n
2

q

(q)12n

with a quasi-modular form p2g+6n2(e2, e4, e6) of weight 2g + 6n  2, and satises the
same holomorphic anomaly equation as 1.2 replaced by the prefactors 1

72 and 1
24 .

it is worth while remarking here that in this case the integration constants may be
determined consistently for all g and n by simply requiring the vanishing conditions for
the rst few terms in the q-expansion of zg;n(q), which is dened by 4.5 (, 3.18 and 3.27)
with d(g, h, k) = ch(g  h, 1)k2g3 (0  h  g)[11].

2. mirror symmetry of a calabi-yau hypersurface in p2  f1

in this section we will consider a calabi-yau hypersurface which contains a generic
rational elliptic surface as a divisor. we collect necessary formulas for the (genus zero)
prepotential.

let us start with the hirzebruch surface f1 which is dened by the quotient (c4 \

z)/  with

and c-actions

z = {(u1, u2, u3, u4)  c4 | u1 = u2 = 0 or u3 = u4 = 0}

(u1, u2, u3, u4)  (1u1, 1u2, 1/1u3, u4)  (u1, u2, 2u3, 2u4) , (1, 2  c) .

we may consider a generic hypersurface in the product of the surface f1 with p2 given
by the data

f1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
x =(cid:18) p2

3

(1, 2)(cid:19)3,75

where (1, 2) refers to the homogeneous degrees with respect to the rst scaling by 1 and
the second one by 2. the dening equation may be written explicitly as

g3,3(z1, z2, z3, u1, u2)u2

3 + f3,1(z1, z2, z3, u1, u2)u2

4 = 0 ,

(2.1)

where z1, z2, z3 represents the homogeneous coordinate of p2 and g3,3 (, f3,1, ) refers to a
generic homogeneous polynomial with bi-degree (3, 3) (, and (3, 1), respectively,) for the
coordinates z1, z2, z3 and u1, u2. this is an elliptic calabi-yau hypersurface over f1 with
the hodge numbers h1,1 = 3 and h2,1 = 75. two of the three elements in h 1,1(x) come
from the base f1 and the other comes from the ber elliptic curve. we may nd in x
a rational elliptic surface s with its dening equation of bi-degree (3, 1) in p2  p1. it
appears as a divisor u3 = 0, which is the cubics in p2 over the (1) curve in f1.

the positive classes in h 2(x, z) are generated by the three integral elements in

h 1,1(x) corresponding to the divisors

h = (z1 = 0)  x , f = (u1 = 0)  x , d = (u4 = 0)  x .

we sometimes denote the corresponding forms by j1, j2 and j3, respectively. it is straight-
forward to determine the non-zero intersection numbers k top

c2ja =rx c2(x)  ja with the second chern class c2(x) to be

k top

112 = 2 , k top

113 = 3 , k top

123 = 3 , k top

133 = 3 ,

abc = rx ja  jb  jc and

c2j1 = 36 , c2j2 = 24 , c2j3 = 36 .

the ambient space p2 f1 is so-called the toric fano manifold, and thus we can easily
construct the mirror calabi-yau hypersurface x  based on batyrevs toric method[bat].
furthermore the prepotential of the mirror calabi-yau hypersurface x  is determined by
the general formula obtained in [12][13].

5

here we collect necessary formulas to determine the prepotential. we start with
a hypergeometric series representing a period integral for a deformation family of x 
parameterized locally by x, y, z;

w0(~x) = xn,m,k0

c(n, m, k)xnymzk ,

with

c(n, m, k) =

(1 + 3n + m + 2k)

(1 + n)3(1 + m)2(1 + k  m)(1 + k)

.

the local parameters (x, y, z) has been chosen so that its origin represents the celebrated
boundary point where the monodromy is maximally degenerated[21][22]. the series w0(~x)
represents the period integral for the invariant cycle about this degeneration point and sat-
ises picard-fuchs dierential equation (see appendix). as a complete set of the solutions
of the picard-fuchs equation, we have {w0(~x) , w(1)
b (~x) , w(3)(~x)} (a, b = 1, 2, 3)
where

a (~x) , w(2)

w(1)

a (~x) =

with w0(~x, ~) = pn,m,k0 c(n + 1, m + 2, k + 3)xn+1 ym+2zk+3 .

solutions of the picard-fuchs equation, the mirror map is dened by the relation

in terms of the

ta =

w(1)
a (~x)
w0(~x)

(a = 1, 2, 3),

(2.2)

which connects the deformation parameters (x, y, z) to those (t1, t2, t3) parameterizing the
complexied kahler moduli of x at the large radius (im(ta)  ). now the prepotential
of the mirror x  is dened to be

f (~x) =

then the mirror symmetry conjecture asserts that the prepotential f (~x) of the mirror x 
combined with the mirror map provides, up to terms of classical topological invariants, the
generating function f0(t) of the gromov-witten invariants of x;

f (t) =

3. holomorphic anomaly equations for g = 0, 1

3.1. local mirror principle and the reduction to s

let us consider the following limit

f (q, p) := f (t)  (topological terms)|imt3

with q = e2it1 and p = e2it2. since the class j3 measures the volume of the ber
p1 of f1 parameterized by u3, u4 and the volume of the curve contained in the divisor
s = (u3 = 0) x are measured to be zero by this class, the limit imt3   throw away all
the gromov-witten invariants except those of the curves contained in the rational elliptic
surface s. thus we may expect that the reduced prepotential f (q, p) coincides with the
generating function dened in section 1. this is so-called the local mirror principle, and
somehow generalize the arguments done for the isolated (1, 1)-curves in calabi-yau
manifolds[17][8].

in our case of the elliptic calabi-yau hypersurface x in p2  f1, the limit imt3  
which translates to the limit z  0 in the mirror x  greatly simplies the period integral
w0(~x);

w0(x, y, z)|z=0 =xn0

(1 + 3n)
(1 + n)3 xn ,

=: (x) .

we note that the series (x) is nothing but a solution of the picard-fuchs equation of the
ber elliptic curve of s:

{2

x  3x(3x + 2)(3x + 1)}(x) = 0 .

(3.1)

another solution of (3.1) about x = 0 may be given by

(x) = log(x)(x) +xn0

(1 + 3n)
(1 + n)3 ((1 + 3n)  3(1 + n)) xn ,

where (z) = d

dz log(z).

it is straightforword, although involved technically, to derive the following consice form for

remark 3.2. by constructing barnes integral representation of the series (x), it is an
easy exercise to make an integral symplectic basis of the picard-fuchs equation (3.1). it
turns out that our bases (x) and (x) in fact constitute an integral symplectic basis
about x = 0. therefore we may write the holomorphic one form of the elliptic curve by
e = 0a + 1b, where a and b are symplectic bases of the elliptic curve. then the

function f1(x) may be written by 3re e  xe. this is so-called the classical yukawa

coupling [6] of the elliptic curve, and may be determined from the picard-fuchs equation
(3.1) to be f1(x) = 9
127x . for the other functions fm(x)(m  2) we will nd a powerful
recursion relation.

the relation (2.2) is also simplied in the limit z  0 due to the following relations

w0(x, y, 0) = (x) , w(1)

1 (x, y, 0) = (x) , w(1)

2 (x, y, 0) = (x) +xm1

lm(x)ym ,

where (x) =pn0

proposition 3.3. under the limit z  0, we nd that:
(1) the inverse series x(q, p) does not depend on p and is given by the level three modular

function;

x(q, p) =

1

t3b(q)

,

(3.2)

where t3b(q) = 12(q)

12(q3) is the thompson series in the notation of [7].

(2) the inverse series y(q, p) is determined iteratively as a power series of p through the

relation

y(q, p) = p(x)e

(3.3)

where (x) = e (x)

we can verify directly using the picard-fuchs equation (3.1) that the formal solution of

(3.10)

as a result we see that the functions fm(x)s may be determined in terms of the recursion
relation (3.7).

since both the bm and dm are polynomials of f1(x) = 9

t3b (q) , they have nice
behavior under the level three modular subgroup (3). therefore the modular anomaly
comes from the e2-term in cm. we may express this anomalous behavior via the partial
derivative of cm;

[]

now we determine the explicit forms z0;n for lower n from the formula (3.12). after
coming to a conjecture about the form of z0;n, we remark that the holomorphic anomaly
equation (3.13) with some obvious inputs for the gromov-witten invariants suces to
determine the form z0;n for all n.

since our formula (3.12) is written in terms of the known functions f1(x), (x) with
t3b (q) and e2(q) for each order of p, and also the order of p coincides with the order

x = 1
of (x), it is easy to deduce that z0;n has the following form in general,

z0;n = g0;n(f1,

e2

2 )2n(cid:18) f1

(3.15)

where we have factored the form of z0;1 = f1
of (3.12), we see in general that 2  g0;n(f1, e2
2 ) is a polynomial of e2
being polynomials of 1/f1 over q. here we present the rst few of them,

here we observe explicitly that  disappears nontrivially in the nal expression of z0;n for
lower ns. we do not have general proof about this but may state it as follows;

conjecture 3.7. the function z0;n(q) in (3.15) takes the form

z0;n(q) = p2n2(e2, e4, e6) (z0;1(q))n ,

(3.17)

where p2n2 is a quasi-modular form of weight 2n  2.

remark 3.8. the function z0;n contains the multiple cover contributions. we may
subtract these contributions considering

z0;n(q) := z0;n(q)  xk|n,k6=1

1
k3

z0;n/k(qk) .

(3.18)

the q series coecients of z0;n count the numbers of rational curves c in our rational
elliptic surface s satisfying (c, h) = d and (c, f ) = n. the homology classes of curves in
s, in general, have the form [c] = dh  a1e1  a2e2      a9e9 with a1, a2,    , a9  0.
therefore we have 3d  a1  a2      a9 = n for (c, f ) = n, which implies 3d  n. in
other words, we should have

n0;d,n = 0 for d <

n
3

(3.19)

for the coecients of z0;n. from a simple counting of the dimensionality of the quasi-
modular forms of weight 2n  2, we see that the vanishing condition (3.19) together with
the above conjecture 3.7 provides sucient data to determine the integration constants
for the recursion (3.13), and determine completely z0;n for all n (, see section 4).

3.3. holomorphic anomaly equation at g = 1

according to [1], we have an explicit expression for the genus one prepotential

f bcov

(t) in terms of the discriminant of the hypersurface x;

f bcov

12

where the discriminant may be determined from the characteristic variety of the picard-
fuchs equation presented in appendix. several exponents in (3.20) have been xed by
the requirements of the asymptotics of f bcov
when imta  . the explicit form of the
discriminant is a complicated polynomial of x, y and z, however, in the limit z  0, it
simplies to

1

dis(x, y, z)|z=0 = (1  27x)3{1  27x + (1 + y)3  1} .

(3.21)

also under this limit,
z(q, p, r) (r = e2it3 ) simplies to

it is easy to show from the denition that the mirror map

z(q, p, r) = re

y(q, p)

= r(x)3

(3.22)

now using the relations (3.5) it is straightforward to derive;

remark 3.10.

1) for the p-independent term of f bcov

(q, p) the local mirror symmetry does not apply.
this is because these curves are parallel to the ber elliptic curves of x and therefore
can move outside of the rational elliptic surface. in fact we see that

1

ng=1;d,0 =(cid:26) 4 d = 3

0 d 6= 3

after subtracting the genus zero contributions ng=0;d,0 = 168 (d  1, 2 mod 3), 144 (d 
0 mod 3). the number 4 should be regarded as the euler number of the base f1 for
the elliptic bration.

2) there is a dierence in the normalization of the prepotentials between f bcov

and
our fg=1 in the introduction. these are related by the factor 2 coming from the
orientation of curves as

1

f1(q, p) =

f bcov

(q, p) .

(3.24)

now we dene the generating function z1;n through

z1;n(q)pn ,

f1(q, p) =xp1

and prove the holomorphic anomaly equation at g = 1.

if we use the relations (3.16) for the polynomials of 1/f1, we nd

contrary to the case of g = 0, the -dependence remains in z1;n(q) after the elimination of
the polynomials of 1/f1. thus we arrive at the follwing weaker statements about z1;n(q);

proposition 3.12. the generation function z1,n(q) in (3.26) takes the form

z1;n(q) = p2n(, e2, e4, e6) (z0;1(q))n ,

where p2n is a quasi-modular form of weight 2n for the modular subgroup (3).

remark 3.13.

1) the form of the polynomial p2n is not unique because of the relation (3.16) among

, e4 and e6.

2) the function z1;n contains the contribution from the genus zero curves (i.e., the
degenerated instanton [1][8],) as well as the contribution from the multiple covers. we
may separate these in z1;n as follows;

z1;n(q) = z1;n(q) + xk|n,k6=1

1(k) z1;n/k(qk) +

1

12xk|n

1
k

z0;n/k(qk) ,

(3.27)

1

where 1(k) =pm|k

m . the function z1;n(q) is expected to count the numbers of
the elliptic curves c with (c, f ) = n in s. as is the case of g = 0, we have certain van-
ishing conditions for the elliptic curves, which is useful to determine the integration
constants for our holomorphic anomaly equation (3.25). however as we will argue in
the next section the appearance  in the polynomial p2n increases unknown param-
eters in the integration constants. from this reason holomorphic anomaly equation
become less powerful than the case of g = 0 to determine z1;n.

15

4. predictions for gromow-witten invariants of higher genera

4.1. general considerations

from the analysis for g = 0 and g = 1, we naturally come to the following conjecture

about the holomorphic anomaly equation for all genera.

conjecture 4.1.
zg;n(q) has the form

(holomorphic anomaly equation for all g) the generating function

p2g+2n2(, e2, e4, e6) (z0;1(q))n

(4.1)

with some quasi-modular form for (3) of weight 2g + 2n  2. (in the special case of
g = 0, it simplies to p2n2(e2, e4, e6), i.e., exactly the quasi-modular form of weight
2n  2). and it satises the recursion relation

zg;n
e2

=

1

72 xg+g=g

n1xs=1

s(n  s)zg;szg;ns +

n(n + 1)

72

zg1;n .

(4.2)

in the following we will consider the solutions of the holomorphic anomaly equation.
for this purpose, rst of all, we need to have some data to x the integration constants
for our recursion relation (4.2). let us suppose that a curve cg in the rational elliptic
surface is in a homology class [cg] = dh  a1e1  a2e2     a9e9, where eis refer to the
1 curves from the blowing ups. then, since zg;n counts the gromov-witten invariants
of genus g curves with ([cg], f ) = n, we should have

([cg], f ) = 3d 

ai = n ,

9xi=1

and for the arithmetic genus

ga(cg) =

(d  1)(d  2)

2



9xi=1

ai(ai  1)

2

= g .

(4.3)

(4.4)

if the curve cg is singular, the arithmetic genus might be dierent from the genus of
the normalization of cg. we will come to this point later, however for the moment we
will ignore this dierence. then it is easy to see that the above two constrains pro-
vide us several vanishing conditions on the numbers of curves. in table 1 we have pre-
sented the lowest degree d = ([cg], h) for which a curve cg may exist for given g and n.

table 1. each number shows the lowest degree d = ([cg], h) for curves of
given g and n.

16

the homology classes of curves in the table may be written explicitly for given g and
n. for example, for n = 1 they are simply given by [cg] = ei + gf
(i = 1,    , 9) . the
data in the table provides us vanishing conditions for the rst few terms in the q-expansion
of zg;n(q), where tilde represents the subtraction of the degenerated instantons from the
gromov-witten invariants. we may relate zg;n(q) (g  2) to the subtracted functions by

zg;n(q) = zg;n(q) + xk|n,k6=1

d(g, g, k) zg;n/k(qk) +

g1xh=0xk|n

d(g, h, k) zh;n/k(qk) ,

(4.5)

with some rational numbers d(g, h, k). therefore all we need to x from the vanishing
conditions are the integration constants together with the rational numbers d(g, h, k).
for higher n > 4 it turns out that the vanishing conditions in table 1 are not sucient to
determine completely both the integration constants of the recursion (4.2) and the form
of the degenerated instanton d(g, h, k). however we will see based on a simple counting
arguments that for lower n  3 they suces at least to x the integration constants for
our recursion relation. especially for the case n = 1 they determine both the integration
constants and the form of the degenerated instanton.

as an extreme case let us rst consider the genus zero generating functions
z0;n(q) (n = 1, 2,   ). as we have already considered in remark 3.8, the only unde-
termined in this case are the integration constants in the polynomial p2n2 in (3.17). we
see that these constants can be xed by the vanishing conditions in table 1 comparing the
rst column of the table with the dimensionality of the modular form of a given weight,
which is given by the series

1

(1  t4)(1  t6)

= 1 + t4 + t6 + t8 + t10 + 2 t12 + t14 + 2 t16 + 2 t18 + 2 t20 +   

.

(4.6)

now let us look at the functions zg;n(q) for all g and lower n( 3). in this case we only
have the weaker assumption on p2g+2n2 in (4.1). taking into account the relation among
, e4 and e6 in the second line of (3.16), we may estimate the relevant dimensionality
of the modular form p2g+2n2|e2=0 (, integration constants of the holomorphic anomaly
equation,) by

(1 + t2 + t4 + t6)
(1  t4)(1  t6)

= 1 + t2 + 2 t4 + 3 t6 + 3 t8 + 4 t10 + 5 t12 + 5 t14 + 6 t16 + 7 t18 + 7 t20 +   

.

(4.7)
the growth of the dimensions should be compared with each line of the table 1 under a
suitable shift. from these comparisons of the numbers of the integration constants and
the numbers of the vanishing conditions, we may deduce that for n  3 the vanishing
conditions suces to determine the integration constants while leaving some of d(g, h, k)
undetermined. to go beyond this rather unsatisfactory situation, we need to know more
details about the numbers of genus g curves of a given homology classes or the form of the
degenerated instanton d(g, h, k). though our simple vanishing conditions are insucient
to determine all the unknowns, we see from the rst line of the table they are restrictive
enough to x the form of zg;1(q) and d(g, h, 1) completely. in the next subsection we will
present a detailed analysis of zg;1(q) for all g.

17

4.2. gromov-witten invariants zg;1 and degenerated instantons

to get some intuition about the curves cg in s, let us rst recall the form of z0;1(q)

obtained in [14][28]

z0;1(q) =

q 3
2 e8 (3t, t)

(q3)12

 = 9

6

q 1

(q)4!

(4.8)

where  = (1,    , 1, 1). the appearance of the e8 theta function originates from the
well-established fact that the sections of the rational elliptic surface form additive group
called mordell-weil group, and it becomes a lattice isomorphic to the e8 lattice endowed
with a positive denite bilinear form[25][14][24]. the eta functions in the denominator
have been explained by introducing pseudo-section which is a composite of a section with
some of the twelve singular bers with its homology class  + kf . thus the function z0;1
counts the numbers of pseudo-sections in s which are not irreducible but naturally come
in the theory of the stable maps[5].

now in our general case of genus g curves with (cg, f ) = 1 the function zg;1 counts
the genus g sections of the elliptic bration of s. since the generic ber spaces are elliptic
curves, the genus g section are composite of two components, one is a pseudo-section and
the other consists of g ber elliptic curves. the genus g sections of the lowest degree are
those with their homology classes given by

[cg] = ei + gf (i = 1,    , 9) .

(4.9)

thus the expansion of zg;1(q) start from q3g with its coecient counting the number of
the genus g sections of class (4.9). (this is the vanishing condition we have listed in table
1 for n = 1 and g.) the g elliptic curves in general avoid the twelve singular bers and
make a g-dimensional family parameterized by symg(p1).

as we have already remarked, the vanishing conditions for the numbers of curves grow
much faster than the dimensionality of the integration constants (4.7) plus the numbers of
the unknowns d(g, h, 1) in

zg;1(q) = zg;1(q) +

g1xh=0

d(g, h, 1) zh,1(q) .

(4.10)

owing to this nice property, we can integrate our holomorphic anomaly equation for n = 1,

related to zg;1 by (4.12).

we note in table 2 that for the rst three terms in the expansion we have

zg;1(q) = (1)g(symg(p1))(9qg + 36qg+1 + 126qg+2 +   )

(4.15)

where (symg(p1)) represents the euler number of symg(p1) = pg. this is also in
agreement with the argument in [11] for counting curves with moduli. from the fourth

term in the series expansion (4.15) contributions from the singular bers come in, which
somehow generalize the situation we encountered in the case of g = 0.

for the rst few of zg;1(q)s we have determined explicitly the forms of the polynomials

p2g(, e2, e4, e6). we nd that if we use the following relations

3e2(q3) = 2(q)2 + e2(q) , 9e4(q3) = 10(q)4  e4(q) ,

27e6(q3) = 35(q)6  7e4(q)(q)2  e6(q) ,

proposition 4.2. the solutions of the holomorphic anomaly equation (4.11) take the
following general form

zg;1(q) = p2g(e2(q3), e4(q3), e6(q3)) z0;1(q) ,

where p2g is a quasi-modular form of weight 2g.

the reason of this simplication will be explained in the next section. here for later

use we dene gg;1 by

zg;1(q) = e8 (3t, t) gg;1(q3) ,

(4.18)

which should count the genus g pseudo-sections made from a section, say the zero section.
we verify directly that the functions gg;1s depend on q through q3 and have the following
expansions;

5. discussions

5.1. counting bps states

in this section we would like to discuss relations of our results to the very interesting

proposals made in the recent works by gopakumar and vafa [10][11].

it is known in physics that the genus g prepotential fg has a meaning as the genus g
topological partition function of the twisted calabi-yau sigma model in the type iia string
theory and it does not receive the string perturbative corrections due to the fact that the
dilaton belongs to the hypermultiplet in the type iia string. since the heterotic/type ii
string duality connects the heterotic dilaton eld to one of the vectormultiplet moduli in
the type iia side, we may expect to extract the non-perturbative properties in the type
iia side from the perturbation theory in the heterotic string. in our case of the topological
amplitude fg, gopakumar and vafa [10][11] have found that it can be derived from the one
loop integral in the heterotic side. they found that the schwinger one-loop calculation for
a particle in a constant background electro-magnetic led applied to the bps states with
spin (j1, j2) under so(4) = su (2)l  su (2)r determines the higher genus fg. according
to [11] the contribution of each bps state with spin (j1, j2) to fg is determined by the
following decomposition with respect to su (2)l  su (2)l  su (2)r;

(j1, j2) =

r[(

1
2

2j1xr=0

)  2(0)]r ,

(5.1)

where we allow r formally to be negative integer. then the topological partition function
has the following expression

xg=0

2g2fg = x:bp s

e2 s

 (a()+im) ,

(5.2)

where a measures the central charge of the bps state  and the summation over m is
explained as the central charge of the fth dimension which originates in the m-theory.
in the type iia theory the central charge a is measured by the kahler classes of the
corresponding calabi-yau manifolds, and after the integration we arrive at

xg=0

2g2fg(t) = x06=h2(x,z) xr0 xk>0

(5.3)

where 
r represents the summation of r() over the bps states  with charge , and
qk = exp(2(k, k)) with k = t1j1 +    + th1,1jh1,1 the kahler class. expanding (5.3)
with respect to  we obtain

fg(q) = x06=h2(x,z)

gxh=0 xk|

21

/k
h k2g3ch(g  h, 1)q ,

(5.4)

which is the general form proposed in [11] and we have reproduced in our special case (,
see (4.12) and (4.14)).

in the type iia picture the bps state appears as the d2 brane with the at u (1)
connection. let us suppose that a genus g curve in a calabi-yau manifold comes with
the moduli of the deformation m. together with the jacobian of each curve we have
the ber space m  m for the bps states. gopakumar and vafa argued based on the
m-theory that in this case the counting bps states in (5.2) is interpreted by the lefschetz
sl(2, c) decomposition of the cohomology of the moduli space m. they propose the
lefschetz decomposition with respect to the ber sl(2, c)l and the base sl(2, c)r of
the cohomology h ( m). once we assume existence of these sl(2, c) actions , we may
arrange this decomposition as

ig  rg + ig1  rg1 +    + i0  r0 ,

(5.5)

where ik := [( 1

2 )  2(0)]k. identifying this decomposition with that in (5.1), they propose

k = (rk)

(k = 0,    , g) ,

(5.6)

where (rk) is the dimensions of the sl(2, c)r representations in rk weighted with
(1)2jr. as argued in [11] we can determine g and 0 easily by the geometric euler
numbers;

g = (1)d(m) , 0 = (1)

d( m) ,

(5.7)

where d = dimm and d = dim m.

now let us consider our genus g pseudo-sections with a xed section, say the zero
section. counting bps states for these pseudo-sections are summarized in the generating
function gg;1 in (4.19). as we have seen in the last section the genus g pseudo-sections
come with the moduli m(g) := symg(p1) = pg. furthermore the data of the jacobian
may be specied by g points on s, one for each elliptic ber. therefore we naturally come
to the space

g

m(g) = gsym

(s) ,

(5.8)

where  represents the resolution of the orbifold singularities via the hilbert scheme of g
points on s, which we denote s[g]. the construction of the lefschetz actions on this space
and making the decomposition (5.5) would be interesting problem, however we already
have predictions for the decomposition;

ig  (rg) + ig1  (rg1) +    + i0  (r0) .

(5.9)

 one of the lefschetz sl(2, c) actions is the multiplication of the kahler form k. since our
moduli spaces have a natural bration structure  : m(g)  m(g) with a section , we may
decompose the kahler class k into kl = (k  ((k))) and kr = (k). this decomposition
denes the sl(2, c)l  sl(2, c)r actions. we would like to thank y. shimizu for pointing this
out to us.

22

namely we can read (5.9) in our expansion (4.19):

g = 1

g = 2

g = 3

g = 4

g = 5

 2 i1 + 12 i0

3 i2  30 i1 + 90 i0

 4 i3 + 52 i2  260 i1 + 520 i0

(5.10)

5 i4  78 i3 + 507 i2  1690 i1 + 2535 i0

 6 i5 + 108 i4  840 i3 + 3636 i2  9090 i1 + 10908 i0

in the next subsection we propose a natural generalization of gottsches formula for the
poincare polynomials of s[g] and reproduce the above predictions. our generalization of
gottsches formula suces to determine the decomposition (5.5).

5.2. gottsches formula with sl(2, c)l  sl(2, c)r

gottsches formula describes the generating function for the poincare polynomials of
the hilbert scheme of g points on a surface s. in our case it appears as a natural resolution
s[n] of the symmetric product symg(s) for the rational elliptic surface. if we assume the
existence of the lefschetz actions sl(2, c)l  sl(2, c)r, then the poincare polynomial
can be written

pt(s[g]) = (t2g) trh (s[g])t2(j3,l+j3,r)

(5.11)

in terms of the diagonal sl(2, c) action. then the problem is to recover both left and
right charges in the above formula, namely, ptl,tr(s[g]) = (tg
. in the case
of g = 1, we note that the decomposition is unique as follows

2(cid:1)l,r  8(cid:0)0, 0(cid:1)l,r =(cid:0)1(cid:1)l+r  9(cid:0)0(cid:1)l+r

now let us recall gottsches formula[9]

(5.12)

g(t, q) = yn1

(1  t2n2qn) (1  t2nqn)10 (1  t2n+2qn)

1

.

(5.13)

as has been interpreted in [26] there is a close relation between (co)homology elements and
the bosonic oscillators associated to each elements in h (s). under this correspondence
the classical cohomology is represented by the lowest modes, say ak(1) (k = 1,    , 12),
and generate the symmetric product of h (s). the higher mode excitations ak(m) come
from the singular strata of the point congurations. here it is natural to assume that the
higher mode excitation ak(m) have the same spin as the lowest mode ak(1), whose spin
contents are uniquely determined in (5.12). under this assumption it is easy to recover
the sl(2, c)l  sl(2, c)r spin weights in gottsches formula

g(tl, tr, q) =yn1(cid:26)

23

1

r(tltr)n1qn) (1  (tltr)nqn)8(cid:27) ,

(5.14)

which provides us the poincare polynomial ptl,tr(s[g]) as the coecient of qg. then our
predictions (5.10) for the lefschetz decomposition should be veried in the formula

+ 2(cid:19)g

+(rg1)(cid:18)tl +

= (rg)(cid:18)tl +

1
tl

(5.15)
for lower g, we have found complete agreements of our predictions from the generating
functions gg;1 with those coming from the above formula. for example, for g = 3 we obtain
from (5.15)

 4(cid:18)tl +

1

+ 2(cid:19)2

1
tl

+ 2(cid:19) + 520 ,

which should be compared with (5.10). we may summarize the above results into a formula
relating gottsches formula with our generating functions(4.18);

(5.16)

5.3. topological string partition function

so far we have xed a section to discuss the moduli space of the curves cg. to recover
the contributions from the mordell-weil lattice, we simply need to multiply the e8 theta
function to the functions we have discussed. therefore for the bps state counting on the
rational elliptic surface s we consider the function e8 (3t, t)g(tl, 1, q3
) in terms of
the generalized gottsches formula. now it is easy to deduce the following relation;

tl

e8 (3t, t)g(tl, 1,

q3
tl

) =xg0
=xg0

zg;1(q)(tl 

1
tl

+ 2)g

zg;1(q)2g2 (2sin


2

)2 ,

(5.17)

where tl = ei and we have used the form of the degenerated instantons given by (4.13).
this implies the function e8 (3t, t)g(tl, 1, q3
) provides us the all genus topological
partition function. we may write (5.17) explicitly by

tl

3
2

q

e8 (3t, t)

(q3)12 yn1

(1  q3n)4

(1  tlq3n)2(1  1
tl

q3n)2

=xg0

zg;1(q)2g2(2sin


2

)2 .

(5.18)

here we recognize the helicity generating function in the left hand side. thus the topolog-
ical partition function has a simple but suggestive form that the genus zero function z0;1

24

multiplied by the helicity generating function, which is actually the starting point of the
analysis done in [11].

here for completeness we prove the compatibility of the above result (5.17) with our
holomorphic anomaly equation (4.11). for this purpose we note the following identity
which can be proved in a straightforward way;

sin/2(cid:19)2yn1
(cid:18) /2

(1  qn)4

(1  eiqn)2(1  eiqn)2 = exp2xk1

(2k)

k

e2k(q)(cid:18) 

2(cid:19)2k . (5.19)

the compatibility may be easily veried if we use 3e2(q3) = 2(q)2 + e2(q) found in
(4.16) and the value (2) = 2
36 for the both side of (5.18) after the
dierentiation with respect to e2(q). also the formula (5.19) explains the simplication
we have encountered in proposition 4.2. namely we have
