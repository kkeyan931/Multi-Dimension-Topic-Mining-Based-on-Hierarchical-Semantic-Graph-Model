abstract

this paper discusses the symmetry of the wave eld that lies to the right and left of a two-
sided accelerated mirror in 1 + 1 space and satises a single condition on it. the symmetry
is accumulated in the bogolyubov matrix coecients  and  that connect the two complete
sets of solutions of the wave equations. the amplitudes of the quantum processes in the
right and left half-spaces are expressed in terms of  and  and are related to each other
by transformation (12). coecient  
 plays the role of the source amplitude of a pair of
particles that are directed to opposite sides with frequencies  and  but that are in either
the left or the right half-space as a consequence of the reection of one of them. such an
interpretation makes  
 observable and explains the equalities, given by eq. (1) and found
earlier by nikishov and author [zh. eksp. teor. fiz. 108, 1121 (1995)] and by author
[zh. eksp. teor. fiz. 110, 526 (1996)] that the radiation spectra of a mirror in 1+1 space
coincide with those of charges in 3 + 1 space by the fact that the moment of the pair emitted
by the mirror coincide with the spin of the single particle emitted by the charge.

1 introduction

it was found in refs.[1] and [2] that the spectra of bosons and fermions emitted by an
accelerated mirror in 1 + 1 space coincide with the spectra of photons and scalar quanta
emitted by electric and scalar charges in 3 + 1 space when the latter move along the same
trajectory as does the mirror. namely, the bogolyubov coecients b,f
 that describe the
spectra of the bose and fermi radiations of an accelerated mirror and the fourier transforms
of the density of the 4-current j(k+, k) and the scalar charge density (k+, k) that describe
the spectra of the photons and scalar quanta emitted by electric and scalar charges are
connected by the relationships

e2|j(k+, k)|2,

it is assumed here that the components k = k0 k1 of the wave 4-vector k of the quantum
emitted by the charge are identied with the doubled frequencies  and  of the quanta
emitted by the mirror:

2 = k+,

2 = k,

(2)

and e is the electrical or scalar charge in heaviside units.

however, there is a substantial physical dierence between the right-hand and left-hand
quantities in eqs. (1), i.e., between the radiation spectra of the charges and of the mirror.
whereas the former are the distribution of the mean number of radiated quanta over the two
independent components k+ and k of the wave vector of the quantum (as a consequence of
the azimuthal symmetry of the radiation, there is no dependence on the third independent
variable), the latter have a more complex interpretation. actually, they will be the spectra
of the mean number of quanta emitted by the mirror to the right only after integration over
frequency  [3]:

dn =

d

d

if the mirror is two-sided and innitely thin, then, besides the quanta emitted to the
right with the spectrum given by eq. (3), it will (as we shall see) also emit quanta to the
left with the spectrum

dn

 =

d

z0

(5)

the thought naturally arises whether it is not possible to regard the quantity

||2 dd

(2)2

as the mean number of pairs of quanta, one of which, with frequency  in the interval d, is
emitted by the mirror to the right, while the other, with frequency  in the interval d, is
emitted to the left. in this case, two frequencies  and  would be observable, characterizing
one event: the emission of a pair of quanta by the mirror, in the same way as two components
k+ and k also characterize one event: the emission of one quantum by a charge. as we can
see, with certain nontrivial complications, such a treatment is actually valid. in any case,
the mirror emits quanta in pairs.

it is elucidated that this circumstance helps to understand another dierence between
the coincident spectra of a charge and a mirror. while the bosons and fermions emitted
by a mirror have a spin of 0 and 1/2, the photons and scalar quanta emitted by electrical
and scalar charges have a spin of 1 and 0. even though the quanta have dierent spin, the
radiation spectra of the charges coincide with the boson and fermion spectra of the mirror.
this coincidence is explained by the fact that, unlike charges, the mirror emits particles in
pairs, and a pair of spinless bosons can have a total moment of 1, while a pair of fermions can
have a total moment of 0. then the moment of the pair emitted by the mirror coincides with
the spin of the particle emitted by the charge. the fact that, upon reection, b
 behaves

2

like a pseudoscalar while f
this (see sections 2 and 4).

 behaves like a scalar can serve as an indirect conrmation of

it is shown in section 2 that the system of bogolyubov coecients obtained for a right-
sided mirror (i.e., for the eld to the right of a mirror with a boundary condition on it),
because of the properties of mirror symmetry, also describes the processes in the eld to
the left of a mirror with the same boundary condition. in other words, the same system of
bogolyubov coecients characterizes the behavior of the eld in all of spaceboth to the
right and to the left of a two-sided mirror.

section 3 describes the connection between the integral quantities that characterize the
radiation of a two-sided mirror, their behavior under certain spacetime transformations,
and the symmetry (or asymmetry) of the spacetime regions where they are formed.

the symmetry of the bogolyubov coecients reects the symmetry of two inequivalent
complete systems of solutions of wave equation, denite and smooth in all of 1 + 1 space,
satisfying inside iton the trajectory of the mirrora single condition and characterized by
propagation of a monochromatic component of each solution toward the right in one system
and toward the left in the other. when the eld is quantized and when the usual comparison
of monochromatic plane waves to particles is made, these two systems of solutions form in
and out systems for the eld to the right of the trajectory and out and in systems for the
eld to the left of it. therefore, the quantum processes in the eld to the right and to
the left of the mirror are independent, even though they are described by a single system
of bogolyubov coecients.
in particular, the particle-production amplitudes to the right
and to the left of the mirror, the single-particle scattering amplitudes in these regions, etc.
are connected with transformation (12). such amplitudes, certain frequency distributions,
and also the distribution of pair-production probabilities over the number of pairs, which is
invariant relative to transformation (12), are computed in section 4. it is shown that  

plays the role of the source amplitude of a pair of particles potentially emitted to the right
and to the left with frequencies  and , with the spin of a boson pair equaling 1, while
that of the fermion pair equals 0.

in the last section, sec. 5, a similar method is used to treat the emission by an accelerated

mirror of pairs the particle and antiparticle of which are not identical.

a system of units in which h = c = 1 is used in this article. to simplify the formulas in
sections 4 and 5, the frequencies are considered discrete, integration over d/2 is replaced
by summation over , and the delta function 2(  ) is replaced by the kronecker
symbol .

2 symmetry of the bogolyubov coecients and radia-

tion of accelerated two-sided mirror

let us consider the connection between radiation spectra and other quantities in two prob-
lems in which the mirror trajectories x = 1(t) and x = 2(t) dier by reection: 1(t) =
2(t). then, if the rst trajectory is described on the plane of variables u = t x, v = t + x
by the function v = v1 = f (u), the second trajectory will be described by the function inverse

(11)

the matrix notations for the bogolyubov coecients make it possible to write the trans-
formations of eqs. (8) and (11), i..e, the transition from trajectory f (u) to g(u), in the
form

  +,

   ,

(12)

where the upper and lower signs here and subsequently correspond to bose and fermi elds.
at the same time, according to the expansions given by eqs. (33) and (34),  and 
are the amplitudes of the waves with frequencies  and  contained in the incident part
of the out wave with frequency , while 
 and  are the amplitudes of the waves
with frequencies  and  contained in the reected part of the in wave with frequency .
therefore, amplitudes 
[g] and [g] describe the generation by a right-sided mirror
on trajectory g(u) of waves escaping to the right with frequencies  and  when wave with
frequency  incident from right to left is absorbed. from purely geometrical considerations,
they must coincide with the amplitudes for the mirror-symmetric processthe generation
by a left-sided mirror on trajectory f (u) of waves escaping to the left with frequencies  and
 when a wave incident from left to right with frequency  is absorbed. then, according
to eqs. (8) and (11), these last are also equal to [f ] and [f ] or equal to [f ] and
[f ] if the frequencies of the monochromatic waves propagating to the right and to the
left are denoted as  and , as was assumed for the eld to the right of the trajectory.

thus, for the eld to the left of a mirror moving along trajectory f (u), [f ] and
[f ] are the amplitudes of waves with frequencies  and  contained in the reected

4

part of the in wave with frequency , while 
[f ] and [f ] are the amplitudes of waves
with frequencies  and  contained in the incident part of the out wave with frequency .
therefore, the matrix that connects the in and out waves of the eld to the left of the mirror
diers from the analogous matrix for the eld to the right of it by transformation (12).

so the transition from trajectory f (u) to the mirror-symmetric g(u) is equivalent to
considering the eld on the part of the minkowski plane not to the right but to the left of
trajectory f (u) with the previous boundary condition on the mirror.

the mean number of particles formed by a two-sided innitely thin mirror on the left

part of the minkowski plane is the same as on the right, since the integral



n = z

dd

does not change when  is replaced by . at the same time, the energy

e  = z

e = z

z0

dd

(13)

(14)

(15)

emitted to the right.

the equality of the mean numbers of particles emitted by a two-sided accelerated mirror
to the right and to the left suggests that the particles are generated in pairs and y o in
opposite directions. quantity (5) is usually considered as the mean number of actual quanta
with frequency  in the interval d, emitted to the right when a quantum with frequency 
in the interval d is absorbed from the vacuum from the right. the question arises whether
it is not possible to regard the same quantity as the mean number of pairs of quanta emitted
to the right and to the left with frequencies  and  in the intervals d and d, respectively.
in other words, is n 1||2 the two-dimensional probability distribution of frequencies 
and  of two quanta escaping to the right and to the left with momenta  and ?
such an interpretation of the frequency distribution of bosons (fermions) emitted by a
mirror in 1 + 1 space would make the coincidence of this distribution with the radiation
spectrum of an electric (scalar) charge in 3 + 1 space detected in refs. [1] and [2] less formal.
although, in the case of mirror emission, the random quantities are the frequencies  and 
of two bosons (fermions) escaping in dierent directions, while in the case of charge emission,
the random quantities are the components k+ and k of the wave vector of one vector (scalar)
quantum emitted to the right or to the left, corresponding to the sign of k+  k > 0 or < 0.
let us give two more evidences of leftright symmetry of the wave eld of an accelerated
mirror that are reected by the bogolyubov coecients.

first, eqs. (6) and (7) or (9) and (10), obtained for the eld to the right of the mirror for
the bogolyubov coecients, represent ||2 by a double integral over the entire uv plane,
as shown by ref. [2]. thus



|2 = rez
z
|b

dudv exp [iu + if (u)  iv  ig(v)],

(16)

while |f
similarly, in the double integral for the mean number of particles emitted to the right,

|2 diers from eq. (16) by an additional factor of qf (u)g(v) under the integral.

the integration is carried out over the entire uv plane, i.e., over all of minkowski space, and
not over the part of it lying to the right of the trajectory. the wave elds to the right
and to the left of the trajectory that satisfy the same condition on it are described by a
single analytical function and therefore are not independent. therefore, the frequencies of
the quanta emitted to the right and to the left are also not independent.

second, the mean energies e and e  emitted to the right and to the left, according to

ref. [2], can be represented as integrals over the proper time  of the mirror:

e b =

e b =

(19)

(20)

here a is the acceleration of the mirror in its proper system.

the rst terms under the integral in eqs. (19) and (20) represent the energy irreversibly
emitted by the mirror respectively to the right and to the left of the section d of the
trajectory.
in the mirrors proper system, these portions of the energy are identical and
equal a2d /12, whereas the portions of irreversibly emitted momentum equal a2d /12.
in the laboratory system, these portions of the energy, because of the opposite directions
of their motion with respect to the velocity  of the source, acquire doppler factors f 
and 1/f . we recall that f  = q(1 + )/(1  ). the second, schott terms under the

integrals in eqs. (19) and (20) smear the formation region of radiation, as a result of

6

which, for the formation of radiation of energy, such intervals  on which the irreversibly
emitted energy exceeds the change of the schott energy are substantial; i.e.,

 a2qf  > |aqf |,



a2
f  > |

a
f |,

(21)

or  > a1; the proper time interval must be greater than the inverse proper acceleration.
the proper acceleration determines the characteristic frequency of the radiation in the proper
system and its scatter:     a. therefore, the condition  a > 1 is equivalent to the
indeterminacy relation   > 1.

3 symmetry and the relations of certain integral quan-

tities

the following representations for the mean number n of emitted particles and the mean
emitted energies e = e+ and e  = e are convenient for explaining their properties with
respect to certain spacetime transformations:

dudv s(u, v),

n b = z



z



n f = z

(26)

1. lorentz transformations. the quantities s(u, v), qf (u)g(u), and dudv are scalars
with respect to the lorentz transformations, while a(u, v) transform as the  components
of a vector. therefore, n b,f are lorentz invariants, while e b,f
are the  components of a
vector.
2. mirror symmetry. when the trajectory is replaced by a mirror-symmetric trajectory,



f (u)  g(u), g(v)  f (v), the integrals n[f ] and e[f ] transform, respectively, to

n[g] = n[f ],

e[g] = e[f ],

(27)

7

since, for such a replacement,

s(u, v)  s(v, u), a(u, v)  a(v, u), qf (u)g(v)  qg(u)f (v),

after which the transformed integrals n and e dier from the untransformed n and e
only in the designation of the variables of integration. thus, the mean numbers of particles
emitted from the same trajectory to the right and to the left are identical and do not change
when the trajectory is replaced by the mirror-symmetric one, while the mean energies emitted
to the right and to the left are dierent and transform into each other when such replacement
is made.

3. synchromirror transformation. this discrete transformation consists of replacing co-

ordinates u and v with the coordinates

u = g(v), v = f (u), so that u = g(v), v = f (u),

(28)

points (u, v) and (u, v), which are related by transformation (28), lie on the minkowski plane
on dierent sides of the trajectory of the mirror on the intersection of the light cones whose
vertices are found on the trajectory at points a(u, f (u)) and b(g(v), v). the points of any
compact region lying to the right of the trajectory are mapped one-to-one into the points of
a compact region lying to the left of the trajectory.

functions s(u, v) and a(u, v) are form-invariant relative to transformation (28); i.e.,

their functional dependences on the new and old variables are identical:

s(u, v)  s (g(v), f (u)) = s(u, v),

a(u, v) = a(u, v).

(29)

since the area element dudvqf (u)g(v) appearing in the fermi integrals n f and e f

form-invariant relative to transformation (28); i.e.,

 is also

dudvqf (u)g(v) = dudvqf (u)g(v),

(30)

the contributions to the fermi intervals from any two regions on the uv plane related by
symmetry transformation (28) are identical. in particular, the contributions from the entire
region to the right and the entire region to the left of the trajectory are identical.

in the bose integrals n b and e b

 , the contributions of the right-hand and left-hand regions
related by transformation (28) are, generally speaking, dierent, since the area element dudv
that appears in these integrals, unlike the functions s and a being integrated, is mapped
by transformation (28) into the unequal element dudv:

dudv = dudvf (u)g(v),

dudv = dudvf (u)g(v).

(31)

therefore, the contributions to the bose integrals from these two elementary areas are pro-
portional to their areas; i.e., their ratio equals the jacobian of the transformation.

transformation (28) of the variables of integration of course does not change the values
of the integrals n and e. its meaning is that the local contributions to n and e from any
pair of right-hand and left-hand regions associated by transformation (28) have a denite
symmetry or asymmetry. namely, for fermi integrals, this symmetry consists of the equality
of such contributions, whereas, for bose integrals, it consists of leftright asymmetry of the
contributions, determined by the jacobian of the transformation.

4 radiation of two-sided mirror, quantum approach

out } and {in , 

for a consistent description of the quantum wave eld lying both to the right and to the
left of the mirror and satisfying a single condition on the mirror, it is convenient to use the
two complete sets {out , 
in } of solutions of the wave equation, given
in refs. [1] and [2]. possessing in the right-hand minkowski plane the physical meaning of
the out and in sets and satisfying the boundary condition on the mirror, these solutions
can be smoothly extended into the left half-plane with no change of their functional form.
however, in the left half-plane, these sets acquire the physical meaning of the in and out
sets, respectively, and they must be designated as {in , 
each such solution is actually unambiguously characterized by the frequency  or  of
its monochromatic component travelling to the right or to the left and by the condition on
the mirror. for a lorentzian transformation with velocity  along the x axis, the frequencies
 and  transform into  and  according to the mutually inverse laws

in } and {out , 

out }.

 = d1() ,

 = d() , d() = s 1 + 
1  

,

(32)

where d() is the doppler factor.  and  thus possess the opposite covariance. below,
frequencies that transform like  will be equipped with an even number of primes, while
those that transform like  will have an odd number. then the subscript in or out, in
addition to the frequency, will simply indicate the side of the minkowski plane on which the
solution is considered.

the expansion of the solutions of the rst set in the solutions of the second set and the

inverse expansion have been written by us (in the right-hand half-plane) in the form

out  = in  + 

in ,

in  = 

out   

out ,

or, if matrix notation is used,

  out

out ! =   

 + + !  in

in ! ,   in





in ! =    

 !  out

out ! .







 

(33)

(34)

(35)

as a consequence of the orthogonality and normalization of the solutions in both sets, the
matrices that appear in eqs. (35) are mutually inverse. this means that the bogolyubov
coecients satisfy four independent matrix relations:

+   + = 1,  +  +  = 0,
+     = 1,
 +     = 0.

(36)

on the left-hand half-plane, eqs. (33)(35) are conserved, but a new physical meaning
requires the interchange of the subscripts in  out in the functions, which is equivalent to
transformation (12).

9

for a quantized eld in the right half-plane, the connection of the in and out absorption

and creation operators a and a+ is given by the bogolyubov transformations

  ain

in ! =     

  !  aout

out ! ,   aout

a+

a+

out ! =   +  +

 !  ain

in ! .

a+

a+

 

(37)

for a eld in the left-hand half-plane, an interchange of the subscripts in  out is required on
operators a and a+ in transformations (37). this again is equivalent to transformation (12).
following dewitts paper [3] and its notation, we represent the vector of the vacuum state
of the eld in the distant past in the form of an expansion in the vectors of the n-particle
states of the eld in the distant future:

|ini = eiw



xn=0

in/2

n! xi1i2...in

vi1i2...in|i1i2 . . . inouti.

(38)

in our case, by the quantum numbers i1i2 . . . in of the out states of the individual particles
should be understood frequencies that transform like  or like  if one is dealing with the
eld, respectively, to the right or to the left of the mirror.

using the equation ain|ini = 0, transformations (37), and the expansion given by eq. (38),
it is easy to show [3,4] that the relative production amplitudes vi1i2...in of n particles equal
zero for odd n, whereas, for even n, they are expressed in terms of the production amplitude
of a pair of particles:

vi1i2...in = xp

pvi1i2vi3i4 . . . vin1in.

(39)

denotes summation over n!/2n/2(n/2)! dierent pairings of subscripts i1i2 . . . in, while
herepp
p = 1 for bosons and p = 1 for fermions when the permutation leading to the given
pairing is, respectively, even or odd. the production amplitudes of a pair of particles with
frequencies  and  in the right-hand region and frequencies  and  in the left-hand
region equal

v = i(1 ),

v = i(1)

.

(40)

they are related to each other by transformation (12), which is symmetric for a bose eld
and antisymmetric for a fermi eld, as follows from eqs. (36).

the indicated number of terms in the amplitude of eq. (39) appears in connection with
its symmetrization (antisymmetrization) and equals the number n! of permutations of its
subscripts, reduced by a factor of 2n/2 because of the already existing symmetry (antisym-
metry) of the two-particle amplitudes and by a factor of (n/2)! because of the inessentiality
of permutations of these amplitudes.

particle production in pairs is explained by the linearity of the bogolyubov transforma-
tions in the operators a and a+. operator ain, when it acts on the n-particle out state,
transforms it into a superposition of n  1-particle and n + 1-particle out states. therefore,
in the expansion of the null vector ain|ini in the n-particle out states, the expansion coe-
cients equal to zero represent the linear relation between the amplitudes of the n + 1-particle
and n  1-particle creations. since n  0, the amplitude of the single-particle production

10

vi1 is equal to zero, and, along with it, all the formation amplitudes of an odd number of
particles.

the absolute amplitudes of the n-particle production are determined and are related to

the relative amplitudes by

hout i1i2 . . . in|ini  hout|aout in . . . aout i2aout i1|ini = eiw in/2vi1i2...in.

(41)

the vacuum-conservation amplitude hout|ini = eiw is determined to within a phase
factor by the fact that the total probability of the transition from the initial vacuum state
is equal to one:

of the production of n particles (or of n/2 pairs) on the right-hand side of eq. (42) we shall
call the statsum. it can be shown that, in the case considered here, in which pairs of identical

the absolute probabilities of forming n pairs are equal to p2n = p0q2n, where p0 is the
vacuum-conservation probability:

p0 = e2 im w ,

2 im w = 

1
2

tr ln(1  m).

(47)

since the relative probabilities q2n(m) of producing n pairs are homogeneous functions of
degree n, q2n(m) = nq2n(m), it is convenient to compute the mean number of pairs from

n =

m = v v + =  +(1   +)1,
m = v v + =   (1    )1,

(49)

(50)

but are related to each other by transformation (12). however, the positive-denite quantities
trm n, n = 1, 2, . . ., are invariants of this transformation. therefore, the total probabilities
given above for conservation of the vacuum, p0, and of the production of n pairs, p2n, and
the mean number of pairs, n, are identical for the right-hand and left-hand regions.
in
particular, the quantities

p0 = e2 im w ,

do not change under transformation (12) or  +   +.
nevertheless, the frequency distributions of the probabilities and of the mean number of
particles possess no leftright symmetry. thus, the production probability of one pair, one
particle of which has a denite frequency while the other has any frequency, equals

p2 = e2 im w    +

1   +!

,

for the right-hand region and equals

p

2 = e2 im w    +

1   +!

(54)

(55)

.

for the left-hand region. the frequency distributions of the mean number of particles emitted
by the mirror to the right and to the left are also functionally dierent from each other:

n = ( +),

n 

 = ( +).

(56)

along with the amplitudes given by eq. (41) for particle production from vacuum by the
mirror, it is necessary to consider the amplitudes of single-particle scattering by the mirror

hout | ini = hout|aout a+
hout | ini = hout|aout a+

in |ini = eiw 1
,
in |ini = eiw 1
 ,

(57)

(58)

for the right-hand and left-hand regions, respectively. these amplitudes dier only in their
phases. of course, they are related to each other by transformation (12), but we shall be
interested in their relation to the corresponding pair-production amplitudes:

hout |ini = eiw (1 ) = x hout | ini 

,

(59)

12

hout |ini = eiw (1)

 = x

 
hout | ini.

(60)

since the pair-production amplitudes and the single-particle scattering amplitudes are
quantities that can in principle be experimentally measured from the corresponding proba-
bilities, eqs. (59) and (60) make it possible to experimentally measure  
. moreover, these
relationships make it possible to regard  
 as the amplitude of the source of a pair of par-
ticles potentially emitted to the right and to the left with frequencies  and , respectively.
in this case, if a particle with frequency  actually escaped to the right, a particle with fre-
quency  does not escape to the left, but experiences an internal reection and is actually
emitted to the right with altered frequency . conversely, if a particle with frequency 
actually escaped to the left, a particle with frequency  cannot escape to the right, but,
after internal reection, is actually emitted to the left with another frequency .

for fermions, amplitude f

 is diagonal in the projection of the spin of the in and out
waves (see ref. [2]). but one of the waves forming f
 has a negative frequency and therefore
describes an antiparticle with frequency and spin projection opposite in sign to the frequency
and spin projection of this wave (see 26 in ref. [5] or 9 of chap. 2 in ref. [6]). thus, the
spin of a pair of generated fermions equals zero. this is conrmed by the scalar nature of
the identically equal integrals in eqs. (9) and (10), in which duqf (u) and dvqg(v) are

elements of proper time d , and by their coincidence,

f 
 =

1
e

 (k+, k)

(61)

with the fourier component of the scalar-charge density in 3 + 1 space.

amplitude b

 of the source of a boson pair, according to eqs. (6) and (7), is linearly
expressed in terms of the fourier components j(k) of the current density of an electric
charge in 3 + 1 space:

b

 = s k+
(k+u + kf (u))(cid:21) ,

(62)

(63)

see also eqs. (1) and (2) in this paper and eqs. (43) and (44) in ref. [1]. the last equality
in eq. (62) is none other than the current-transverseness condition, k+j + kj+ = 0. it
can also be seen from eq. (62) that b
 is a pseudoscalar, since, at the reection k  k,
j  j, and b changes sign. vector j(k) is spacelike and, in a system where k+ = k
(or  = ), has only a spatial component, precisely equal to eb

. in covariant form,

eb

 = kj/qk+k.

thus, the source of a boson pair is the conserved current vector given by eqs. (63), and this
means that the spin of a pair equals 1, see [7].

the fact that the spin of a boson pair equals 1 while that of a fermion pair equals 0 is

essential for understanding the coincidence of the spectra of a mirror and of a charge.

obtain from eqs. (6) and (9),

where  and  are related to  and  by transformation (32), in which  is the eective
velocity of the mirror on the emission section. in this approximation, the emission amplitudes
given by eqs. (59) and (60) for pairs of particles with frequencies  and  to the right and
pairs of particles with frequencies of  and  to the left equal, respectively,

(65)

(66)

these formulas, including the connection between the frequencies of the waves incident on
the mirror and reected from it, conrm the interpretation of  

 given above.

we now turn our attention to interference eects in the production of bose and fermi
particles. they become most substantial when matrices m for bosons and fermions satisfy
the conditions

i.e.,

tr ln(1  m) =  ln(cid:18)1 
tr m n = (cid:18)1

tr m(cid:19)n

tr m(cid:19) ,

, n = 2, 3, . . . .

(67)

then the statsum given by eq. (44) for bose and fermi particles reduces, respectively, to

(cid:18)1 

1
2

tr m(cid:19)1

and

1 +

1
2

tr m.

(68)

this means that the probabilities of producing n pairs of bosons form the geometrical pro-
gression

while the probabilities of emitting two or more pairs of fermions disappear; i.e., only the
production of one fermion pair is possible:

2n = 0, n  2.

(70)

in other words, the conditions given by eqs. (67) denote the most constructive interference
of bosons and the most destructive interference of fermions. in these cases, the mean-square
uctuation of number of boson pairs is always greater than nb, while that of the fermion
pairs is less than nf , being equal to n(1  n), where

0 < nb =

we are less interested in the case in which interference eects can be neglected. in this case,

tr m k  tr m, 1 ;

5 emission of pairs consisting of nonidentical particles

and antiparticles

in the case of pair production of nonidentical particles and antiparticles (ab pairs), the direct
and inverse bogolyubov transformations (37) are replaced by

  ain

in ! =   aa  

ab
ba 

bb !  aout

out ! ,   aout

b+

b+

b+

aa  +
out ! =   +
 ab

bb !  ain

in ! .

b+

ba

(74)

these transformations contain not two but four matrices aa, bb, ab, and ba, which satisfy
not the four eqs.(36) but the six equations

aaaa   +
+
+
bbbb   +
bb+
bb   

baba = 1,  +
ba
abab = 1, aa+
ba = 1, aa +
ba

bb  +
aa   
ba   

aa 
ab = 0,
ab = 1,
ab
ab bb = 0.

(75)

however, these relationships can be written in the form of eqs.(36) if  and  stand for the
22 matrices consisting of the indicated quarters:

 =   aa

0

0

bb ! ,

 =   0

ba

ab

0 ! .

(76)

as can be seen from eqs.

(74), the interchange in  out is now equivalent to the

interchange

aa  +

aa, bb  +
bb,

ab   ba,

ba   ab,

(77)

which can be represented in the form of the transformation (12) if  and  stand for the
matrices of eqs.(76).

using for the in-vacuum state an expansion of the type of eq.(38) and the equations
ain|ini = bin|ini = 0, it can be shown that all the emission amplitudes of an odd number
of particles equal zero, while the production amplitudes of an even number of particles are
products of the production amplitudes of ab pairs:

v ab
 = i(1

aa  

ab),

v ab
 = i(ab1
bb )

,

(78)

respectively for the right-hand and the left-hand regions. as follows from eqs. (75), the
amplitudes given by eqs. (78) possess intrinsic bose symmetry or fermi antisymmetry:

v ab
 = v ba

  i(1

bb  

ba),

 = v ba
v ab

aa )
  i(ba1

.

(79)

15

thus, the formation amplitude of an ab pair can be denoted via vi1i2, where the subscript
i1 characterizes the state of the particle and i2 that of the antiparticle. the production of
two ab pairs is described by the amplitude

vi1i2i3i4 = vi1i2vi3i4  vi3i2vi1i4,

(80)

symmetric (antisymmetric) separately with respect to states i1 and i3 of the particles and
separately with respect to states i2 and i4 of the antiparticles. we also write the production
amplitude of three pairs:

vi1i2i3i4i5i6 = vi1i2vi3i4vi5i6  vi3i2vi1i4vi5i6 + vi3i2vi5i4vi1i6

in the general case, the production amplitude of n/2 pairs has the form

 vi1i2vi5i4vi3i6 + vi5i2vi1i4vi3i6  vi5i2vi3i4vi1i6.

vi1i2...in = xp

pvi1i2vi3i4 . . . vin1in,

(81)

(82)

where the sum is taken over all (n/2)! terms that dier by a permutation of the odd subscripts
(or, what is the same thing, by a permutation of the even subscripts), with p = 1 in the
case of fermions for an even or odd permutation, respectively, while p = 1 in the case of
bosons. then amplitude vi1i2...in will be symmetric (antisymmetric) both over particle states
i1i3 . . . in1 and over antiparticle states i2i4 . . . in.

the relative probability

qn =

1

(n/2)!(n/2)! xi1i2...in

|vi1i2...in|2

(83)

of producing n/2 pairs consisting of nonidentical particles and antiparticles contains the
factor 1/(n/2)!(n/2)!, which, along with the symmetry (antisymmetry) of amplitude vi1i2...in
separately for even and separately for odd subscripts, makes it possible to sum over the
particle and antiparticle states, considering the ranges of variation of the quantum numbers
of these states to be independent. without this factor, the sum over i1i2 . . . in would have had
to contain only physically dierent states. in our case, for example, it would be unambiguous
that the frequencies of the particles must satisfy the condition 1  3  . . .  n1, while
the frequencies of the antiparticles must satisfy the condition 2  4  . . .  n.
it is easy to construct the rst four terms of the statsum in terms of the relative ampli-
tudes shown above:

q0 = 1,

q2 = tr m,

q4 =

1
2

1
2

tr m 2,

(tr m)2 
1
3

q6 =

1
6

(tr m)3 

1
2

for the statsum as a whole, we get

tr m tr m 2 +

tr m 3.

(84)



xn=0

1

(n/2)!(n/2)! xi1i2...in

|vi1i2...in|2 = det(1  m)1 = exp(tr ln(1  m)).

(85)

16

here, as in eq. (44), m = v v + is a hermitian positive-semidenite matrix. it is given by
eqs. (49) and (50), in which by  is meant, respectively, ba and ab.

just as above, the absolute probabilities of the formation of n pairs of nonidentical par-
ticles and antiparticles equal p2n = p0q2n, where p0 is the vacuum-conservation probability:

the mean number of pairs, computed according to the rule given in eq. (48), equals

p0 = e2 im w ,

2 im w = tr ln(1  m).

(86)

(87)

n = tr

m
1  m

.

it can be seen that these formulas dier from the corresponding eqs. (47) and (48) for pair
production of identical particles by replacing (1/2)tr by tr in the latter equations. because
of the a  b symmetry in the matrices, under the tr sign, by  can be understood both ba
and ab.

it is easy to see that this rule connects all the formulas for the integral characteristics of
pair production of identical particles with the formulas of the corresponding characteristics of
ab-pair production. thus, in order to obtain from eqs. (51)(53) and (67)(73) the analogous
expressions for ab-pair production, it is sucient to replace (1/2)tr in these formulas with
tr and by  to understand ba or ab.

as far as the spectral characteristics shown, for example, in eqs. (54)(56) are concerned,
they undergo no changes when the transition is made to the case under consideration, if by
 is understood ba (ab) for the spectrum of particles (antiparticles) emitted to the right
and ab (ba) for the spectrum of particles (antiparticles) emitted to the left.

in fact, for the dierential probability p2 shown in eq. (54), the original integral

p2 =



z0

d
2 |hout |ini|2

(88)

represents it as the sum of the probabilities of physically dierent events regardless of whether
the particles are identical or not. however, the total pair-formation probability p2 as a sum of
probabilities of physically dierent events for identical particles is represented by the integral

p2 =



z0

d
2



z0

d
2 |hout |ini|2 =

1
2



z0

d
2

p2.

(89)

since the states in this case dier only by the values of the large frequency  and the small
frequency  of two identical particles. at the same time, for an ab pair,

p2 =



z0

d
2



z0

d
2 |hout |ini|2 =



z0

d
2

p2.

(90)

since the states dier in the frequencies  and  of the particle and antiparticle indepen-
dently of each other, while the particle and antiparticle dier in turn in that they interact
dierently with the counters.

17

turning to the amplitude of ab-pair production,

hout|bout aout |ini  hout |ini = eiw (1

aa  

ab) = eiw (1

bb  

ba),

(91)

we note that it reduces to a product of the source amplitude  
ba of oppositely directed
aa or 1
a and b particles and the backscattering amplitude 1
bb of one of them, as a result of
which both particles of the pair move in the same direction. the symmetry of eqs. (79) makes
it impossible to establish which of the particles of the ab pair experiences backscattering.
