abstract

we study a novel ve-dimensional, n=5 supergravity in the context of lie super-

algebra su(5/2). the possible successive superalgebraic truncations from n=5 theory

to the lower supersymmetric n=4,3,2, and 1 supergravity theories are systematically

analyzed as a sub-superalgebraic chain of su(5/2) su(4/2)  su(3/2)  su(2/2) 

su(1/2) by using the kac-dynkin weight techniques.

i. introduction

there have been considerable interests in superalgebras which are relevant to many

supersymmetric theories.1,2 supersymmetric extensions of poincare algebra in arbitrary

dimensional space-time were reviewed, and their representations (reps) for the super-

multiplets of all known supergravity theories were extensively searched by strathdee.3

this work has been an extremely useful guideline for studying supersymmetric theories.

cremmer4 developed the complicated method for consistent trunctions by choosing a

particular rep of real symplectic metric in order to derive n=6,4,2 supergravities from

n=8 in ve dimensions. recently, m and f theories5 have been also tackled from the

point of view of the general properties of the superalgebra.6

on the other hand, during last ten years, we have shown that superalgebras allow

a more systematic analysis for nding the supermultiplets7,8 of several supergravity

and superstring theories by using the kac-dynkin weight techniques of su(m/n) lie

superalgebra.9 in particular, we have shown that the massless reps of supermultiplets

of maximal supergravity theories10,11 belong to only one irreduclble representation (ir-

rep) of the su(8/1) superalgebra.12 recently, we have shown that all possible suc-

cessive superalgebraic truncations from four-dimensional maximal n=8 supergravity

theory to lower supersymmetric ones are systematically realised as sub-superalgebra

chains of su(8/1) superalgebra13 by using projection matrices14. very recently, we

have shown that the successive superalgebraic trunctions from d=10, n=2 chiral

supergravity10 to possible lower dimensional nonmaximal theories can be easily re-

alized as sub-superalgebra chains of su(8/1) lie superalgebra.15

in this paper, we show that the successive superalgebraic trunctions from the novel

d=5, n=5 supergravity to possible lower dimensional theories can be systematically

realized as sub-superalgebra chains of su(5/2) lie superalgebra. in sec. ii, we briey

recapitulate the mathematical structure of the su(5/2) superalgebra related to d=5,

n=5 supergravity. through the introduction of atypical representations of su(5/2)

superalgebra, we newly nd the supermultiplets of d=5, n=5 supergravity theory. up

to now, no one mentions the existence of one irrep of su(5/2) supermultiplets describing

this theory.

in sec.

iii, we explicitly show that supermultiplets of possible lower

supersymmetric supergravity theories can be systematically obtained from su(5/2)

2

by successive superalgebraic dimensional reductions and truncations. the last section

contains conclusion.

ii. kac-dynkin structure of su(5/2) superalgebra

the kac-dynkin diagram of the su(5/2) lie superalgebra is

w1

w2 w3 w4

w5 w6

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)o(cid:13)

(1)

where the set (w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w6) determines the highest-highest weight vector of

an irrep.1,2 each weight component wi (i 6= 5) of the highest-highest weight vector

should be a nonnegative integer, while w5 could be any complex number. the rst four

white nodes and the last node form su(5)  su(2) bosonic subalgebra, where su(2)

is isomorphic to so(3) describing the massless modes of ve dimensional space-time

symmetry. the grey node is responsible to u(1) supersymmetric generator.

the corresponding graded cartan matrix is

let the positive and negative simple even roots of su(5)  su(2) bosonic subalgebra

be 

i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6), and let the positive and negative simple odd roots be  5

odd roots are easily obtained by the commutation relations such as

i

i , i+1

i

i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

then the action by an odd root i

alternates a bosonic (fermionic) oor with a

fermionic (bosonic) one.

the fundamental rep of su(5/2) is (1 0 0 0 0 0), and it has the substructure of

[(5, 1, 2)b  (1, 2, 5)f ] in the basis of the su(5)su(2)u(1) bosonic subalgebra,

where the subscripts b and f stand for bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom, re-

spectively, as follows:

(1 0 0 0 0 0)

| ground > (1 0 0 0 0 0) = (5, 1, 2)b

(4)

  1

5

| 1st >

(0 0 0 0 1 1) = (1, 2, 5)f .

the u(1) supercharge generator is diag(2,2,2,2,2,5,5) to satisfy the supertraceless

condition. the complex conjugate rep of the fundamental rep is (0 0 0 0 0 1) =

[(1, 2, 5)f  (5, 1, 2)b] such as

(0 0 0 0 0 1)

| ground > (0 0 0 0 0 1) = (1, 2, 5)f

(5)

  5

6

| 1st >

(0 0 0 1  1 0) = (5, 1, 2)b.

the even and odd roots consist of the adjoint rep (1 0 0 0 0 1), which is obtained

by the tensor product of the reps in eqs.(4) and (5),

(1 0 0 0 0 0)  (0 0 0 0 0 1) = (1 0 0 0 0 1)  (0 0 0 0 0 0),

as follows

| 1st > (1 0 0 1 0 0) = su(5)

(0 0 0 0 0 0) = u(1)

| 2nd > (0 0 0 1 0 1) = i

.

in general, the irreps of su(m/n) are divided into two types, which are typical and

atypical.1,9 all atypical reps of su(5/2) are characterized by the fth weight component

w5 of the highest-highest weight. the atypicality condition9 is given by

w5 =

j

x

k=6

wk 

4

x

k=i

wk  10 + i + j,

1  i  5,

5  j  6.

(8)

an atypical rep is obtained by terminating some odd root strings in a full weight system

when w5 satises the relation in eq.(8) for specic is and js. thus the atypical reps

generally have not equal bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom.

on the other hand, all the typical reps of su(5/2) consist of eleven oors, and have

equal bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. the lowest dimensional typical rep is

(0 0 0 0 w5 0) = [512b  512f ] for w5 6= 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1. we take w5 =  3

2 to

make a real rep and normalize the u(1) supercharges by 3 such as

as you know, since the maximum dimension of supermultiplets of the consistent

supergravity theories is [128b  128f ], it is impossible to accommodate the supermul-

tiplets of ve-dimensional theory in terms of the typical irrep. thus we should search

atypical cases having lower dimensions in contrast to the typical ones, and have found

the atypical reps of the type (0 0 0 0 0 w6) for w6  4 are [8(2w6  3)b  8(2w6  3)f ]

weight component. the  1

string is terminated so that the fth oor is terminated

from the weight system in eq.(10). in fact, the only atypical rep containing the de-

sired novel d = 5, n = 5 supergravity multiplets is (0 0 0 0 0 4) = [40b 40f ] such as

although the reps (0 0 0 0 0 w6) for w6  5 have equal bosonic an fermionic degrees of

freedom, they contain higher spin states, which are higher than spin-2 ones, leading to

inconsistent theories. on the other hand, the atypical reps for w6  3 are (0 0 0 0 0 3) =

[25b  24f ] containing a gravitino, (0 0 0 0 0 2) = [13b  10f ] having a yang-mills

eld, and (0 0 0 0 0 1) = [5b  2f ] including a matter eld. note that since all these

7

reps have larger bosonic degrees of freedom than fermionic ones, it is impossible to

construct the d=5, n=5 yang-mills theory with any combination of these reps.

iii. successive possible superalgebraic truncations

from n=5 to n=4,3,2,1

3.1 d=5, n=4 reduction

now, let us consider the possible superalgebraic truncations from the d = 5, n = 5

to d = 5, n = 4, 3, 2, 1 supergravities. one must carefully remove extra gravitino mul-

tiplets in a consistent manner in order to generate the existence of the n = 4, 3, 2, 1

theories. the massless modes of the supermultiplets are in the rep space of su(n)

 su(2)  su(n/2) supersymmetry. the branching rules su(5/2)  su(4/2) 

su(3/2)  su(2/2)  su(1/2) are systematically attained by the successive re-

moving of the rst nodes from the kac-dynkin diagrams.

a branching rule of su(5/2)  su(4/2) for the rep in eq.(11) is

(0 0 0 0 0 4)  (0 0 0 0 4)  (0 0 0 0 3)

(12)

then, the rep (0 0 0 0 4) = [24b  24f ] of su(4/2) is just the well-known graviton

multiplet of d = 5, n = 4 supergravity3 as follows

(13)

note that the remaining rep (0 0 0 0 3) = [16b + 16f ] makes an extra gravitino

multiplet, which should be removed for consistency in the d = 5, n = 4 theory. on

the other hand, the atypical reps for w6  2 are given by (0 0 0 0 2) = [9b  8f ], and

(0 0 0 0 1) = [4b  2f ].

3.2 d=5, n=3 reduction

the massless modes of supermultiplets of d = 5, n = 3 are described in the rep

space of su(3)  su(2)  su(3/2) superalgebra. the branching rule of su(4/2) 

su(3/2) is

(0 0 0 0 4)  (0 0 0 4)  (0 0 0 3).

(14)

then, the rep (0 0 0 4) = [14b + 14f ] of su(3/2) is identied to the graviton

multiplets of d = 5, n = 3 supergravity as follows

(15)

the other rep (0 0 0 3) = [10b +10f ] makes an extra gravitino multiplet, which should

be removed for consistency in the d = 5, n = 3 theory.

on the other hand, in contrast to the previous cases, at this level we can introduce

an interesting atypical rep (0 0 0 2) = [6b + 6f ] describing a desired pure yang-mills

multiplets such as

the rest atypical rep (0 0 0 1) is given by [3b  2f ].

3.3 d=5, n=2 reduction

the massless modes of supermultiplets of d = 5, n = 2 are in su(2)  su(2) 

su(2/2). the branching rule of su(3/2)  su(2/2) is

(0 0 0 4)  (0 0 4)  (0 0 3),

(0 0 0 2)  (0 0 2)  (0 0 1).

(17)

then, the reps (0 0 4) = [8b+8f ], (0 0 2) = [4b+4f ], and (0 0 1) = [2b+2f ] of su(2/2)

is graviton multiplets, yang-mills multiplets, and matter multiplets of d = 5, n = 2

supergravity, respectively, as follows;

note that the rep (0 0 3) = [6b + 6f ] denotes an extra gravitino multiplet, which

should be removed for consistency in the d = 5, n = 2 theory.

3.4 d=5, n=1 reduction

the massless modes of supermultiplets of d = 5, n = 1 are in u(1)  su(2) 

su(1/2) superalgebra. the branching rule of su(2/2)  su(1/2) is

(0 0 4)  (0 4)  (0 3), (0 0 2)  (0 2)  (0 1), (0 0 1)  (0 1)  (0 0).

(21)

then, the rep (0 4) = [5b 4f ] of su(1/2) may play a role of the graviton multiplet

of d = 5, n = 1 supergravity due to the existence of graviton as follows

(22)

however, since this rep has asymmetry between bosons and fermions, we should couple

this graviton multiplet to the following asymmetric matter one (0 1) = [1b  2f ]:

then, the coupled reps (0 4)  (0 1) = [6b  6f ] have same bosonic and fermionic

degrees of freedom which make consistent graviton multiplets. note that the rest rep

(0 3) = [3b + 4f] makes an extra gravitino multiplet, which should be removed for

consistency in the d = 5, n = 1 theory. on the other hand, the contents of the

atypical rep (0 2) = [3b  2f ] are given by

note that in contrast to the d=5, n=5 case, we can construct the desired d=5, n=1

yang-mills theory by using the coupled reps (0 2)  (0 1) = [4b  4f ] because (0 1)

rep in eq.(23) has larger fermionic degrees of freedom than bosonic ones.

iv. conclusion

in conclusion, we have newly studied a novel supermultiplets of d=5, n=5 super-

gravity in the context of su(5/2) superalgebra. we have obtained possible regular

maximal branching patterns in terms of kac-dynkin weight techniques. then, we

have shown that the possible superalgebraic truncations from the d=5, n=5 super-

gravity theory to the d=5, n=4,3,2,1 theories can be systematically realized as sub-

superalgebra chains of the su(5/2) superalgebra. as results, we have explicitly identi-

ed the supermultiplets of the possible relevant lower supersymmetric theories, which

have been classied in terms of super-poincare algebra by strathdee, with irreps of

su(n/2) superalgebra by using the systematic superalgebraic truncation method. fi-

nally, since several authors16,17 have recently considered d = 5 supergravity theories18

through the compactication of m theory, we hope through further investigations that

our superalgebraic branching method will provide a deeper understanding of the struc-

ture of the supersymmetric systems including the m and f theories.
