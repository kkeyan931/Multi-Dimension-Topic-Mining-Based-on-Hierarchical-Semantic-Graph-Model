abstract

the spacetime superalgebra via the supermembrane probe in the background of ads4
s7 is discussed to the lowest order in the spinor coordinate . to obtain the correct
spacetime superalgebras, all 2 order corrections for supervielbein and super 3-form gauge
potential have to be included. the central extension of the superalgebra osp(8|4) of the
super isometries for ads4  s7 is found.

it has become clear in the last couple of years that worldvolume dynamics of super
p-branes propagating in anti de sitter (ads) backgrounds gives rise to (p + 1)-dimensional
superconformal eld theories (scft) [1]. from the connection between the near-horizon
geometry of the brane solutions in string theories and certain scft, it is of much interest
to study the supermembrane in the background of ads4 s7. among others, progress has
been made recently [2]-[13] in understanding green-schwarz superstring, the d3-brane in
the iib supergravity background of ads5  s5, and supermembrane in 11d supergravity
backgrounds of ads4  s7 and ads7  s4.
in 11d supergravity, the ads4  s7 and
ads7  s4 backgrounds leave 32 supersymmetries intact. these backgrounds are related
to the near-horizon geometries corresponding to m2- and m5-brane congurations and
thus are related to possible scft in 3 and 6 dimensions with 16 supersymmetries.

on the other hand, the analysis of supersymmetry algebras is one of the most powerful
approaches to m-theory. there are two kinds of supersymmetries: one is the spacetime
superalgebra and the other is the worldvolume one. in refs. [14, 15], the superalgebras
were derived from test m-brane actions in at background, and recently it was extended
to the backgrounds of m2- and m5-branes [16]. due to the simplicity of the killing spinors
in the backgrounds of m2- and m5-branes, the author of ref. [16] was allowed to set half
of the killing spinor  and the fermionic coordinate  to zero from the beginning. this
eectively makes the transverse coordinates inert under the spacetime dieomorphism
transformation and considerably simplies the necessary calculations.

in the present paper, we discuss how to construct the spacetime superalgebras via
supermembrane probe in the background of ads4  s7. in this geometry, there remain
32 intact supersymmetries in ads4  s7 and the corresponding killing spinors take the
special form of a triangular matrix with the vanishing lower left corner [6, 17]. so we
cannot put  and  to zero, and should use the explicit killing spinors in ads4  s7
to construct the supercharges which possess the fermionic super isometry of the back-
ground [12]. to get correct spacetime superalgebras via supermembrane in ads4  s7
in the wess-zumino-type gauge [18], we nd that all 2 order corrections for superviel-
bein and super 3-form gauge potential should be included, which is dierent from the
case in the background of m2-branes [16] where some 2 order terms were ignored. the
reason is that the transverse coordinates inert under the superspace dieomorphism trans-
formation are now activated in ads4  s7 due to the killing spinors characterizing the
fermionic super isometry of the background. though this makes the whole calculations
quite complicated, we derive the explicit expressions for the supercharges. since there is
ordering ambiguity in the denition of the supercharges at the quantum level, we analyze
the spacetime superalgebras by computing the poisson brackets of supercharges. we nd
that the central extension of superalgebra osp(8|4) of super isometries of ads4  s7 can
be partially realized by supercharges q. in the static gauge, the obtained poisson brack-
ets { q, q}p.b. can be simplied, from which we can see that half of the supersymmetry

is broken. in other words, the superconformal symmetry generated by its generator s
is nonlinearly realized on the worldvolume elds. this means that the superconformal
symmetry is spontaneously broken, but it can be recovered when the supermembrane sits
on the boundary.

now let us consider the near-horizon geometry of the m2-brane solution, which is

given by ads4  s7:

dinates of ads4 to make them dimensionless. the killing spinors satisfy the equations

space indices are represented with hats on them. gamma matrices satisfy { m,  n} =  m n with  m n =

eq. (5), the fermionic terms are suppressed for our background (1). in ref. [16], the terms at

dieomorphism transformation. in the superspace, the super-coordinate transformation
can be dened as [20]

which means that the supermembrane action (4) is invariant under the super-coordinate
transformation (6) up to total derivatives. in deriving eq. (8), we have used eqs. (1) and
(5)-(7).

now we use the explicit killing spinors in ads4  s7 to construct the supercharges,
which possess the fermionic super isometry of the background [12]. in the hamiltonian

where , , a and  are conjugate momenta of x, r, a and , respectively.
in
deriving eq. (9), we have included all the 2 order corrections for supervielbein and super
3-form gauge potential, which is dierent from the approximation in ref. [16] where some
2 order terms were ignored.

up to this point, we have obtained the supercharges via supermembrane probe in
ads4  s7, which looks quite complicated. however, due to the special structure of the
supercharges, we can simplify the expression in certain gauge. since there is ordering
ambiguity in the denition of supercharges (9) at the quantum level, we restrict the
following discussions to the classical level. the generalization to the quantum level is left
to future work.

this is the general result we obtain. we will see that it can be extremely simplied in
certain gauge.

if we decompose the 11-dimensional gamma matrices into the ones referring to the
s respectively, eq. (10) can be written

ads4 and s7 spaces and denote them by s and  
as

n q , q op.b.

=  (5c)h2 ( 

sc )  p s

 h ( 

stc )  m sti

c 
+c (m 2)

 h2 (sc) p s + 2h (st5c) m sti
,  + o(2),

(13)

where 5 = 012r and the charge conjugation matrix c is decomposed as c = c 
c . the coecient h is read o from f = 6he which in turn can be obtained
from eq. (1). the ps and mst correspond to the bosonic generators in so(3, 2) while
ps and mst to those in so(8) [2]. eq. (13) shows that the central extension of the
superalgebra osp(8|4) of the super isometries of the background can be partially realized
by the supercharges q which are induced from the worldvolume of supermembrane probe
in ads4  s7. the complete central extension of the superalgebra osp(8|4) by explicit
eld construction in the worldvolume of the supermembrane will be discussed elsewhere.
now let us see how the above superalgebras of supercharges q can be simplied in the
static gauge, from which we can read o the unbroken supersymmetries. in the classical
static vacuum solution of the supermembrane equations of motion given by [11]

we have

x = , r = const. , a = const. ,  = 0,

 =

l(0)
 x +

1

0ijixjxc (3)

 = 0,  = a = 0,

(14)

(15)

where l(0) is the rst term in eq. (4). with the help of eqs. (14) and (15), we can simplify
eq. (13) to obtain

n q, qop.b.

= iz d2

r2

2 he(2)r (1  )i

,

(16)

from which we see that in the static gauge (14), half of the supersymmetry is broken.
in fact, if we choose diagonal representation for the matrix  = diag(11616, 11616)
q, which correspond to
q, s = q  1
and decompose q into q = q+  1+
2
2
poincare and conformal supersymmetry generators [11], we have

{q, q}p.b. = 0, {q, s}p.b. = 0,

{s, s}p.b. = iz d2

r2

e3r.

(17)

eq. (17) shows that the superconformal symmetry generated by s is nonlinearly realized
on the worldvolume elds, which means that if the supermembrane probe sits at any nite
r, the manifest superconformal symmetry is broken when we gauge-x the action and ex-
press it in terms of the physical transverse coordinate elds. however, the superconformal
symmetry is recovered when the supermembrane sits on the boundary at r  , which
is consistent with the known results [2, 11, 12].

in the above discussion, we have only constructed the supercharges in the wess-
zumino-type gauge to the lowest order in . it would be interesting to check whether
it is possible to construct them in killing spinor gauge [4, 6] to all orders in . it is also
interesting to discuss the spacetime superalgebras via super 5-brane probes. one of the
interesting examples is to consider the construction via d5-brane probe in ads5  s5,
and to see how to realize the maximally extended d5-brane worldvolume supersymmetry
algebra from the explicit superalgebras [21].
