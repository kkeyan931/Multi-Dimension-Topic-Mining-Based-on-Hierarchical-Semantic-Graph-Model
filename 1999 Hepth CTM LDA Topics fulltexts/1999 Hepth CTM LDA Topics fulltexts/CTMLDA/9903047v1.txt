in this article we review some recent results previously reported in [1,2], where a new

type of nonperturbative excitations was identied in the thirring and schwinger models.

this eect is explicitly observed in the light-cone quantization using functional methods.

the eect arises from the need to compactify the x coordinate in the light-cone, which in

eect changes the spacetime topology.

integrating out the right-handed fermions (r) yields an eective action for left-handed

fermions (l) which contains excitations similar to abelian instantons produced by a com-

posite of l. right-handed fermions dont have a similar eective action and therefore,

quantum mechanically, the symmetry l  r must be broken as a result of the topol-

ogy. the conserved charge associated to the topological states is quantized. dierent cases

with only fermionic excitations or bosonic excitations or both can occur depending on the

boundary conditions and the value of the coupling.

alternatively, one can start from an action including an auxiliary vector eld which,

upon integration of r, carries instanton excitations [2]. in what follows, we discuss the

rst approach and mention in the conclusions the dierences with the second alternative.

in recent years quantization in the light cone frame has been extensively studied in

connection with the discovery of new non-perturbative eects that would be unobservable

in the standard spacetime quantization [35].

there are several reasons that make the light cone quantization a method radically

dierent compared to the standard quantization. the dispersion relation kk = m2becomes

k+k = m2, in the light cone. this implies that the particles and antiparticles occupy

disconnected sectors of momentum space. furthermore, if the momentum k+ is discretized

by compactifying x, the energy k is also quantized and nonzero. thus, the light cone

momentum is never singular if the spacetime topology is s1   [6].

the above comments show that the quantization in the light cone is naturally dened

over a manifold with non-trivial topology. as a consequence, one could expect new physical

eects originated in the implicit dierence in topology from standard spacetime quantization.

from this point of view, the massless thirring model is an example where one could

investigate the new eects that emerge in the light-cone frame. we will show below that,

contrary to the standard quantization, the non-trivial topology of the light-cone spacetime

induces abelian instanton-like excitations, i.e. a purely quantum mechanical eect that

appears in the calculation of the fermionic determinant.

let us consider the massless thirring model in the light cone frame

l = i

l+l + i

rr  2g2(

ll)(

rr),

(1)

where  = 

x and x+ and x play the role of time and space respectively.

one should note that (1) is invariant under the charge conjugation symmetry l,r 



l,r, that is expected to be conserved at the quantum level. however in order to quantize

2

the system following the path integral methods it is more convenient to write (1) as follows

l = 

r(i  2g2

ll)r + 

l(i+)l,

= 

r(i + 2a)r + 

l(i+)l.

where a = g2

ll.

the symmetry under charge conjugation including the auxiliary eld a is now



l  l,



r  r, a  a.

thus, the generating functional,

z = z d

after integrating over the right handed elds is

z = z d

ldl det(i + 2a) eir dx+dx

li+l,

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

where i + 2a is a one-dimensional dirac operator.

it should be noted that a =

a(x, x+) is a function of two variables. the eigenvalues n of the equation

[i + 2a]n = nn,

(6)

are parametric functions of x+, which can be determined integrating (6) with x+ xed.

on the other hand, as i + 2a describes a fermionic system, usual practice would be

to solve (5) using antiperiodic boundary conditions. however, the periodic topology of x

also allows for twisted boundary conditions

(x+, ) = e2i(x+)(x+, 0),

where the real parameter  should be xed by quantum consistency.

the solution of (6) is

n(x+, x) = eir x

dy[2a(x+,y)n]0,

(7)

(8)

where 0 is a grassmann spinor independent of x . using (7) the eigenvalues are found to

be

n =

using -function regularization, the determinant is found to be

(a) = det(i + 2a) = n sin(  ),

(9)

(10)

where  = r 

0 dxa is the magnetic ux produced along the surface x+ = const. and n

is a normalization constant.

thus, the eective quantum theory for the left handed elds reads

z = z yx+

with (a) given by (10).

(11)

in order to preserve quantum mechanically the charge conjugation symmetry, the bound-

ary conditions have to be consistent with the transformation    . this requires that

e2i = e2i

(12)

and then  must be an integer (periodic boundary conditions) or a half-integer (antiperiodic

boundary conditions). the next step is to observe that the boundary condition (7) is

invariant under the shift    + 1. this implies

(a) = +1(a),

which requires sin(  ) = sin(  ( + 1)), or equivalently

sin(  ) = 0.

in view of the assertion (12), the only consistent solutions of (14) are:

 = (m +

, with m, m  z,

(13)

(14)

(15)

or,

 = m,  = m, with m, m  z.

(16)

in summary, the thirring elds obey either antiperiodic boundary conditions with half-

integer ux, or periodic boundary conditions with integer ux.

as a consequence of (14) the fermionic determinant satises the condition

(a) = (a).

(17)

and the theory is invariant under charge conjugation. in fact, condition (14) means that

the generating function for the eective theory vanishes. this should come as no surprise

because, as noted by t hooft, the path integral for a massless fermion vanishes when the

fermi eld couples to a gauge eld with nontrivial topology [7] (see also [8]).

this result shows that there are two points of view to analyze this problem. before

integrating out r each fermi eld interacts with a background made out of fermions of

the opposite chirality. after integrating out one of the two species, the remaining eld

self interacts with its own condensate .

in our discussion 

ll plays the role of an

external background gauge eld a with non-trivial topology interacting with the 

l. as

a consequence of the light-cone quantization, the left-right symmetry is broken because x

is compactied but not x+. thus, although the starting classical action (1) is symmetric

under l  r, quantum mechanically only left-handed charge is conserved.

in fact, the conserved noether charge associated with a rigid phase rotation of the eec-

tive action (11) is

q =: z 

0

dx

ll,

(18)

while a similar conserved charge for the right-handed fermions is not dened in the eective

theory. furthermore, this charge is quantized by virtue of (15) or (16). in the previous form

of the path integral (4), the right-handed charge q+ =: r 
but obeys an anomalous quantum algebra with q.

0 dx

rr, is classically conserved

5

at this point one could note that the expression for the determinant of the one-

dimensional dirac operator obtained by using -function is not the most general expres-

sion for the regularized determinant. the general form of the regularized one-dimensional

determinant is

(a) = ea+b sin ,

(19)

where  =    and a and b are arbitrary coecients that depend on the regularization

procedure. this general form is obtained starting from the formal expression of (a) as

an innite product of eigenvalues depending on . in order to give meaning to this product

one considers the logarithm as a (divergent) sum and takes enough derivatives with respect

to  (two) until a convergent sum, which is the series representation of sin2 , is obtained.

the linear expression a + b gives the most general -dependence due to the divergence of

the one-dimensional determinant. the result of -function regularization corresponds to the

particular choice of the regularization parameter b = 0 and e a is the normalization constant

n in (10).

if one takes the general form (19) for the regularized one-dimensional determinant, the

consistency condition (13) leads now to

h1 + ebi sin(  ) = 0

(20)

instead of (14), and this implies once more a quantization of the ux, (15) or (16) , for

b 6= i(2n + 1) . the possibility to have a charge conjugation invariant theory without a

quantized ux by choosing appropiately the regularization, b = i(2n + 1) , deserves further

investigation.

we end up this discussion by pointing out that an important information on the non-

perturbative spectrum of the model can be read from the relation,  = g2q, between the

quantized ux  and the conserved charge q which counts the number nl of left-handed

fermions in a xed-x+ surface.

in the case of periodic boundary conditions m = g2nl; then one has m = nl = 0, i.e.

only neutral bosonic excitations, unless g2/ is a rational number. if g2/ = p/q then the

6

quiral charge has to be a multiple of q and the magnetic ux will be  = nlp/q. for q

even one has bosonic excitations while for q odd the spectrum contains both bosonic and

fermionic excitations.

in the case of antiperiodic boundary conditions one has (m + 1/2) = g2nl and g2/ has

to be a rational number with even denominator. only states, characterized by an integer n,

with a chiral charge nl = (2n + 1)q/2 and a ux  = (n + 1/2)p appear in the spectrum;

for q/2 even one has a purely bosonic spectrum but in the case q/2 odd only fermionic

excitations are present.

the results presented here can be summarized as follows:

(i) a fermionic topological

instanton-like excitation arising from the compactication of the x; (ii) quantum me-

chanically, the massless thirring model is analogous to the 4 theory in 1+1 dimensions,

where an abelian instanton is also possible (see e.g. [9]; (iii) dierent situations with only

fermionic excitations, bosonic excitations or both can be identied ; (iv) the quantum system

breaks the classical left-right symmetry.

the lesson weve learned is that a simple self-interacting fermionic system can have many

more excitations than those expected perturbatively. this last statement is particularly

interesting for qcd4 at low energies where this kind of theory - v.i.z. the nambu-jona-

lasinio model- is expected. it remains to be proven whether a similar construction can be

carried out in higher dimensions.

to end up let us point out that a quantization of the thirring model in the light-cone

compatible with the conservation of the vector current is possible if an auxiliary vector eld

is introduced before integrating out the fermion elds. in this formulation the non-trivial

topology of space-time, due to the compatication of the x coordinate in the light-cone,

leads to a quantization condition due to the boundary conditions. new excitations are

also identied in this case as a consequence of the contribution of the zero modes. this

formulation can be applied beyond the thirring model; for an analysis of the excitations

and vacuum structure of the schwinger model and chiral schwinger model see [2].
