abstract: t-duality in m(atrix) theory has been argued to be realized as morita
equivalence in yang-mills theory on a non-commutative torus (ncsym). even
though the two have the same structure group, they dier in their action since
morita equivalence makes crucial use of an additional modulus on the ncsym side,
the constant abelian magnetic background. in this paper, we reanalyze and clarify
the correspondence between m(atrix) theory and ncsym, and provide two resolu-
tions of this puzzle. in the rst of them, the standard map is kept and the extra
modulus is ignored, but the anomalous transformation is oset by the m(atrix) the-
ory rest term. in the second, the standard map is modied so that the duality
transformations agree, and a so(d) symmetry is found to eliminate the spurious
modulus. we argue that this is a true symmetry of supersymmetric born-infeld the-
ory on a non-commutative torus, which allows to freely trade a constant magnetic
background for non-commutativity of the base-space. we also obtain a bps mass
formula for this theory, invariant under t-duality, u-duality, and continuous so(d)
symmetry.

gauge theories on non-commutative spaces arise in m(atrix) theory compacti-
cations with non-vanishing three-form cij on the light-cone [1], and in string theory
as world-volume theories of d-branes in large b-eld [2]. this eect is most easily
understood in toroidal compactications after t-duality: the torus with large b-eld
turns into a slanted torus, and the non-locality characteristic of non-commutative
geometry arises from the shortest open strings relating the d-brane to its trans-
lated images as the torus becomes more slanted [2, 3]. in fact, in the presence of a
non-vanishing b-eld,  or u(1) eld strength, since only the combination f + b is
gauge-invariant  the longitudinal coordinates at the end of the open strings attached
to the d-brane become non-commutative [4, 5, 6], revealing that the world-volume
itself has turned into a non-commutative space. therefore, the worldvolume theory
of d-branes should described by born-infeld theory on a non-commutative space [7].
unfortunately, this theory lacks a precise denition, for the same reason as non-
abelian born-infeld theory does. in this work, we shall follow a rather indirect route
to uncover some of its properties.

the dynamics of n d0-branes on t d in the sen-seiberg limit of vanishing volume
[8, 9] is supposed to describe m-theory on the light-cone [10, 11] and the background
b-eld, hold xed in the limit, simply corresponds to the vev of the three-form eld
strength cij on the lightlike direction [1]. the bps mass formula on the m-theory
side is known from u-duality considerations [22] (see [12, 13] for a review), whereas
the bps energy spectrum in the non-commutative super-yang-mills theory (nc-
sym) was derived rigorously in [14]. this theory is invariant under a so(d, d, z)
group generated by morita equivalence, which was argued to reect the t-duality
invariance of m-theory on a torus t d+1 [1, 15]. further studies have followed in
[16, 17, 18, 19]. the bps spectrum even organizes itself in multiplets of the ex-
tended u-duality group ed+1(d+1)(z), although only t-duality is a symmetry of the
mass formula [20, 21, 22, 23]. the correspondence between the m-theory and gauge
theory sides nevertheless encounters several diculties. for one thing, the ncsym
theory seems to oer an extra modulus ij, which corresponds to a constant abelian
magnetic background, and for another, t-duality and morita equivalence act dier-
ently on the two sides, even though representing the action of the same so(d, d, z)
group. our rst aim in this paper is to reconcile the two sides and clarify this
correspondence.

our rst approach takes advantage of the fact that the abelian magnetic back-
ground couples to the yang-mills elds through topological terms, and thus can be
set to zero upon proper account of the induced spectral ow. the resulting theory is
no longer invariant under morita equivalence, but we shall argue that the anomalous
variation is oset by a rest term which is naturally motivated from the m(atrix)
side. in this way, we recover the standard mapping between m-theory and ncsym,
and conrm the identication of the m-theory b-eld with the ncsym deforma-
tion parameter . we also obtain a simpler relation between ncsym energies and

1

m-theory masses than usually presented. this will be discussed in section 1.

in our second approach, we pay full respect to the dual parameters  and  of
the ncsym, and exhibit a map to the m-theory b-eld modulus which translates
morita equivalence into the standard t-duality. this map is not one-to-one, and
indeed we uncover a continuous so(d) symmetry relating the various preimages of a
given b. these map and symmetry can be found in equations (2.10,2.11) in section
2 of the present paper for the d = 2 case, and (2.23,2.24) for the general case. we
propose that this invariance is a true symmetry of the putative born-infeld theory
on a non-commutative torus, and exhibit an t-duality and u-duality invariant mass
formula (2.25) which reduces to the ncsym mass formula in the non-relativistic
ls  0 limit (in the sense of [24]), and to the usual born-infeld mass formula for
a commutative torus. our result implies that a magnetic background  can be
freely traded for a non-commutativity  of the base-space, through a so(d) trans-
formation. this equivalence between base-space non-commutativity and magnetic
background ts nicely with the observations reported in [25]. unfortunately, for lack
of an appropriate formulation of non-commutative born-infeld theory, proving that
this invariance is a full-edged symmetry will remain beyond reach.

1. m-theory and m(atrix) gauge theory

m-theory mass spectrum and t-duality. the bps mass formula for m-theory com-
pactied on a torus t d times a circle of radius rs in the presence of general gauge
backgrounds was obtained in [22] from u-duality requirements. for simplicity, we
shall at rst focus on the d = 2 case, where it shrinks to a more manageable form,

(1.1)

here, lm denotes the 11d planck length, ai and bij the o-diagonal metric gis and
three-form cijs where s stands for the direction of radius rs, and the contractions are
performed with respect to the metric gij or inverse metric gij on the torus t d. the
integers ms, mi, mis, mij and k i, k s stem from the reduction of the charges mi, mij
and k i of the particle and string multiplets on t 2  s1, respectively. in particular,
the string charges are related to the particle charges through k i = mj mij for 1/4-
bps states, which has to vanish for 1/2-bps states. their physical interpretation
is clear from their contributions to the mass: ms and mi are the momenta around
s1 and t 2, mis and mij are the membrane charge on s1  t 2. this mass formula is
invariant under the u-duality group sl(3, z)sl(2, z) on t 2s1 = t 3, under which
the momentum multiplet charges transforms as (3, 2) and the string charges as (3, 1).

whose action is most easily seen after going to string theory variables l2

following sen and seiberg [8, 9], the discrete light-cone quantization of m-
theory on a torus t d with light-cone momentum m is equivalent to m-theory com-
pactied on t d times a space-like circle of radius rs with momentum m, in the

(1.10)

where we suggestively dened mide = q +  dim e. this invariance was deduced in
[15] from morita equivalence of non-commutative tori t. it is important to notice
that this transformation involves the magnetic background eld , as also recognized
in [1, 16].

morita equivalence and t-duality reconciled. we now would like to reconcile the m-
theory mass formula (1.6) and ncsym mass formula (1.8). the two certainly look
very similar, but there are some important dierences. first of all, the rst term in
(1.6), linear in the charges, has no counterpart in (1.8): it may be included on the
gauge theory side by adding an innocuous term

srest =

g2
y m l4

(1.11)

to the action functional (1.7). indeed, this term is simply the constant term in the
born-infeld action, and gives the mass of the m dd-branes on which the gauge theory

lives. such a linear term was also introduced by hand in [1] to enforce invariance.
we will nd more hints for the relevance of born-infeld theory shortly.

the second major dierence is in the extra modulus  which appears on ncsym
side and has no obvious counterpart on the m-theory side. when  = 0 and up to
the rest term, we obtain agreement under the map

(p, q) = (m, n) ,

and reduces to the standard map at b =  = 0.

however, we should still understand how the two sl(2, z) transformation rules (1.3)
and (1.9) relate to each other.

s

one resolution of the puzzle comes in the following way. first, one should notice
that although the modulus  appears naturally in the proof of so(d, d, z) morita
invariance of ncsym, one can always exclude it from the nal formula:
its only
contribution to the action functional (1.7) is through topological terms, and conse-
quently the energy for  6= 0 can be deduced from the one at  = 0 through

e() = e( = 0) +

(1.13)

v
4g2

y m (cid:0)2ijtr f ij + (ij)2tr 1(cid:1)

we have tr 1 = dim e = p  q, and the central charge tr fij can be calculated
in terms of topological numbers by means of the formula relating the generating
function of topological numbers (e) to the chern character ch(e), which for d = 2
implies that tr fij = qij. in this way, we recover the formula (1.8). using the above
formula, we can thus easily derive the transformation rule for the energy at  = 0:

e( = 0)  e( = 0) + c

2(cp + dq)  c|p  q|

2v g2

y m (c + d)

(1.14)

the rest term being strictly invariant.

let us now consider the m-theory side. the exact mass formula m2 is invariant
under the standard t-duality (1.3).
in the limit rs  0 and therefore t2  0,
the transformation rules (1.3) reduce at leading order to the ncsym ones (1.9).
under these truncated transformation rules, the rest term is thus invariant, but the
quadratic term changes as in (1.14). however, there are subleading corrections to
the transformation rules,

such that the rest term is no more invariant, but instead varies in the opposite way as
the quadratic term (1.14), thus cancelling the anomalous variation of the energy. in
this way, we have reconciled the two apparently dierent transformation rules (1.3)
and (1.9).

m-theory and ncsym on higher-dimensional tori. we now would like to show that
this correspondence holds in more general cases. the mass formula for m-theory
on a torus t d times a circle is known in full generality from [12]. in order to keep
things manageable and given the diculties in dening the matrix gauge theory on
t d, d > 4, we shall restrict ourselves to d  4. in addition to the charges appearing
in (1.1), we need to introduce those coming from the reduction of the charges mijklm
and k ijkl of the particle (or ux) and string (or momentum) multiplets on t d+1. we
should also take into account the vev c3 of the m-theory three-form on the torus t d.
the bps mass formula then reads

the composite charges k of the string multiplet are as usual expressed for 1/4-bps
states in terms of those in the particle multiplet through

k s = mimis , k i = mjmij + msmis , k ijks = mlmijkls , k ijkl = msmijkls

(1.18)

and vanish for half-bps states. in the sen-seiberg limit, the only terms remaining
are ( ms)2 at leading order, ( mij)2 and ( mis)2 at next-to-leading order, together with
the rst and third term under the square root. we thus obtain, in string variables,

on the other hand, the energy spectrum for ncsym on a torus t d was derived in
full rigour in [14] for up to d = 4 by computing the central charges in the superalgebra.
for d = 3, it is possible to introduce a topological term ijktr f0ifjk in the action
which only aects charge quantization. one then nds

agreement with the m-theory side (1.19) under the standard map (1.12a), upon
identifying

ijk = cijk ,

p = ms , ni = mi ,

qij = mij , mi = mis ,

(1.21)

and dropping the charge k ijkl which vanishes by antisymmetry.

finally let us consider the case d = 4. the dimension now involves the second

agreement with the m-theory mass formula up to the rest term, upon identifying
r = ijklmijkls/4!.

2. magnetic background versus non-commutativity

the magnetic background  as a compensator eld. we now would like to oer a
second resolution of the puzzle, which yields a much deeper insight into the role of the
modulus . let us rst focus on the rst term in the ncsym energy (1.8), together
with the rest term. we can rewrite the two contributions in a more suggestive way
as

erest + ef lux =

y m l4

where we dened t = l2
the morita transformation rules (1.9), or in terms of the present variables

s/v . this expression is as we argued exactly invariant under

 

a + b
c + d

,   (c + d)2  c(c + d) ,

t  t/(c + d)2

(2.2)

leaving ls and v /g4
y m invariant. in fact, the expression (2.1) arises as the two leading
terms in the small t expansion of the square root of an hypothetical relativistic
generalisation of (2.1),

m2 =

v
g4
y m l6
s

[m  n]2 + t2 [n  (m  n)]2

t

(2.3)

where each term is separately invariant under the ncsym duality (1.9). we claim
that (2.3) is (part of) the mass formula of born-infeld theory on a non-commutative
torus, and will return to this claim shortly.

the sl(2, z) invariance of (2.3) seems to be realized in a quite dierent way from

that of the standard sl(2, z) invariant mass formula
|m  nt|2

m2 =

v
g4
y m l6
s

t2

(2.4)

which appears as the rst term of (1.6). in order to see the relation between the two,
we note that these mass formulae can be recast in the form

m2 =(cid:0)m n(cid:1)  ete (cid:18)m
n(cid:19)

where e is an element of sl(2, r) in both cases:

e =

1

t2 (cid:18)1 t1

0 t2 (cid:19) ,

e =

1

t(cid:18) 1



t (1  )t(cid:19)

(2.5)

(2.6)

now, in contrast to e, e is not an upper triangular matrix, but instead a lu product

e =

1

t(cid:18) 1 0

0 t (cid:19)
t 1(cid:19) (cid:18)1 

(2.7)

this can be brought into an upper triangular form through a so(2) rotation from
the left, so that e can be rewritten as

e = () 

with

pt(1 + t22)(cid:18)1 + t22 (1 + t22) + t2

the rotation drops from the mass formula (2.5), so that the two mass formulae (2.3)
and (2.4) agree upon identifying the two upper triangular sl(2, r) elements e and
()1e, i.e.

t =(cid:18)

(2.10)

it is easy to check that under this change of variables, the morita equivalence trans-
formation rules (1.9) imply the usual t-duality ones (1.3). the interpretation of
the modulus  is thus quite clear: it, or rather its associated angle  = arctan(t),
parametrizes the so(2) maximal compact subgroup of sl(2, r), which leaves the
mass formula (2.5) invariant. this implies that the mass formula (2.3) is invariant
under translations of ,

which identies various , , t three-ples2. in particular, it is always possible to choose
 = 0, upon redening  and t, or  = 0, upon redening  and t. at  = 0, the
b-eld is identied with the non-commutative deformation parameter , and the
metric on the ncsym side is simply the inverse of the m-theory metric, so that the
gauge theory lives on the reciprocal torus, albeit non-commutative. at  = 0 instead,
the map (2.10) yields t = 1/( + i/t), and recalling that t = l2
s/v , we see that
the gauge theory leaves on the commutative torus which is t-dual to the m-theory
torus. we should emphasize that the symmetry (2.11) holds only for the born-infeld
mass formula (2.3), and not for its non-relativistic limit (2.1), and therefore only
born-infeld theory should allow for this trade o between non-commutativity and
background magnetic eld.

this mass formula reduces to (1.8) in the sen-seiberg non-relativistic limit ls  0
holding v /g2
s xed, and to the usual born-infeld energy formula when
 = 0, and coincides with the one proposed in [26] in the special case  = 0. we
claim that this is the bps energy formula for supersymmetric born-infeld theory
on a non-commutative torus. this theory may be tentatively dened by the action
functional

but the determinant would need to be properly dened. the resulting theory should
exhibit the same morita equivalence like its well-dened ncsym cousin. the invari-
ance of the bps mass formula under the so(2) symmetry (2.11) hints to a dynamical
symmetry of this putative theory, which would allow to trade an abelian magnetic
background ( 6= 0) for a non-commutativity of the base-space ( 6= 0). unfortu-
nately, we are not able to prove this assertion at that stage. given that non-abelian
yang-mills on a commutative torus is morita equivalent to ncsym at a rational
value of the deformation parameter , one may hope to use this symmetry to shed
light on non-abelian born-infeld on a commutative torus by relating it to its abelian
version on a commutative torus with magnetic background.

generalization to higher-dimensional tori. we now would like to generalize our con-
siderations to higher-dimensional tori. the standard t-duality invariant mass for-
mula in the vector representation of so(d, d, z) takes the form

mi(cid:19) ,
m2 =(cid:0)mi mi(cid:1)  ete (cid:18)mi

e =(cid:18)(v 1)t

v(cid:19) (cid:18)1 b
1(cid:19) 

(2.15)

where e is the general form of a so(d, d, r) element up to left action of the maximal
compact subgroup so(d)  so(d). v is the vielbein of the metric g = v tv , and
can be chosen in an upper triangular form. the action of so(d, d, z) then takes the
standard form

g + b  (a(g + b) + b)(c(g + b) + d)1 , (cid:18)mi

mi(cid:19) (cid:18)a b

c d(cid:19)(cid:18)mi
mi(cid:19) ,

(2.16)

where a,b,c,d are integer-valued matrices parametrizing an so(d, d, z) element,
(2.17)

atc = cta , btd = dtb , atd + ctb = 1

the experience with the d = 2 case as well as the way  enters in the general
energy formula (1.22) suggests that the appropriate element of so(d, d) parametrized
by the moduli g, ,  is instead

e =(cid:18)(v1)t

v(cid:19) (cid:18) 1

1(cid:19) 
 1(cid:19) (cid:18)1 

(2.18)

10

where v is the vielbein of the inverse metric g1 = vtv. this mass formula is invariant
under the morita equivalence transformation rule,

  (a + b)(c + d)1 ,   (c + d)(c + d)t + c(c + d)t ,

(2.19a)

y m ,

(2.19b)

(2.19c)

we now want to nd a mapping between (g, , ) and (g, b) which translates (2.19)
into (2.16). for this, we rotate the element e into a block upper triangular form
through a so(d) action from the left,

e =(cid:18) 1+

(cid:19)

(2.20)

where the rotation parameter is given by the orthogonal matrix

 = (1  vvt)(1 + vvt)1

(2.21)

the so(d) rotation drops from the mass formula, so that we can identify (2.20) to
(2.15),

g = (g  g1)1 , b =   (g  g1)1g1

(2.22)

or in terms of the variable ,

g = vt ( + 1)2

v , b =   vt 2  1

v

(2.23)

 thus appears as a compensator eld for the so(d) compact subgroup of the con-
tinuous t-duality group so(d, d, r)3. under this change of variables, the morita
equivalence (2.19) becomes the standard t-duality map (2.16). for  = 0, the non-
commutative deformation parameter  is equated to the m-theory b-eld, while
the metric is the inverse of the m-theory metric, so that the gauge theory leaves
in the deformed momentum space. for  = 0 instead, the relation (2.23) be-
comes g + b = (g + )1, so that the gauge theory leaves on the commuta-
tive t-dual torus. for d = 2, we recover the previous result (2.10) upon setting
v = t,  = i,  = i,  = ei.

3the invariance under the other so(d) compact subgroup is a consequence of the lorentz

invariance of the theory.

11

as in the d = 2 case, there is a continuous symmetry so(d) which rotates e and
implies an action on the moduli v, , . finding the complete action is cumbersome,
but we can easily derive the innitesimal transformation,

dv = ( + 1)2d v ,

d =

1
4

vt(cid:20)  1

 + 1

d + dt   1

 + 1(cid:21) v .

(2.24)

which leaves left-hand side of the map (2.23) invariant. again, we stress that this
symmetry is a property of the relativistic dispersion relation, and not of its galilean
limit.

in the same way as for d =
born-infeld theory on a non-commutative d-torus.
2, we can now use these results to derive relativistic generalizations of the bps
energy formulae (1.20,1.22), which reduce to them in the decoupling limit ls  0
and reproduce the d = 2 result (2.3) in the decompactication limit. one way to
proceed is to start from the m-theory mass formula (1.16), translate it in gauge
theory variables through the relations (2.23) at  = 0, and switch on the modulus 
according to the mass formula (2.18) translated into the appropriate representation
of so(d, d). restricting ourselves to the case d  4 , we obtain

here we gathered the charges according to their representation under so(4, 4): con-
jugate spinor (p, mij, mijkl), vector (mi, mi), spinor (ki, kijk), singlets (k, kijkl) respec-
tively. for 1/4-bps states, the momentum multiplet charges are related to the ux
multiplet charges through

k = mimi ,

ki = mjmij + m mi ,

kijk = mlmijkl ,

where k = ((c + d)t)1, as appropriate for a spinor representation of so(d, d),
[15, 19, 14]. besides, in contrast to its non-relativistic limit, it is by construction
invariant under the full u-duality group, so(5, 5, z) in the maximal case d = 4 that
we considered, which in the context of m(atrix) theory was named extended u-duality
[21, 22, 23]. it is also invariant under the so(d) symmetry (2.24) which allows to
trade the deformation parameter  for the magnetic background . for  = 0, it
agrees with the formula constructed in [26]. equation (2.25) should therefore give the
energy of 1/4-bps states of supersymmetric born-infeld on a non-commutative torus
t d with arbitrary magnetic background , once this theory receives an appropriate
denition.
