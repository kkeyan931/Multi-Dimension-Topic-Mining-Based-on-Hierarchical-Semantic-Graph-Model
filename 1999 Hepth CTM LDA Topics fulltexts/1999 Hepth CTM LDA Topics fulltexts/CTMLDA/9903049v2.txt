supersymmetry and the yang-mills eective

action at finite n

we study the eective action of quantum mechanical su (n ) yang-mills theories with

sixteen supersymmetries and n > 2. we show that supersymmetry requires that the
eight fermion terms in the supersymmetric completion of the v4 terms be one-loop exact.
we also show that the twelve fermion terms in the supersymmetric completion of the v6

terms are two-loop exact for n = 3. for n > 3, this no longer seems to be true; we

are able to nd non-renormalization theorems for only certain twelve fermion structures.

we call these structures generalized f-terms. we argue that as the rank of the gauge

group is increased, there can be more generalized f-terms at higher orders in the derivative

expansion.

1. introduction

symmetry principles give us rather remarkable control on the low-energy physics of
supersymmetric gauge and gravity theories. for example, instanton corrections to the f 4

terms in three-dimensional n=8 su (2) yang-mills can be determined using just super-
symmetry [1]. likewise, all d-instanton corrections to the r4 terms in the type iib string

eective action are determined by supersymmetry [2,3]. the aim of this work is to ex-

plore the extent to which supersymmetry determines the structure of the eective action of
yang-mills theories with maximal supersymmetry and gauge group su (n )1 with n > 2.

in attempting to extend the technique developed in [4,5] beyond rank one, we will nd

some interesting new physics and some subtleties.

we will study the eective action at a generic point on the coulomb branch where
the gauge group is broken to its maximal torus.2 largely for notational simplicity, we will

study the quantum mechanical gauge theory that describes the low-energy dynamics of

d0-branes [6,7]. this theory rst appeared in [8,9]. a similar analysis can be performed

for yang-mills theories in higher dimensions.

in section two, we consider terms of order v4. more precisely, we study all possible
eight fermion terms in the supersymmetric completion of v4. we show that all eight

fermion terms must be generated at one-loop. our results extend the analysis presented

in [4,10] for the quantum mechanical gauge theory. to show that the remaining terms at
order v4 are one-loop exact requires either constructing the full eective action using a

noether procedure, or using the arguments described in [11,12]. we certainly expect that
all terms at order v4 in the quantum mechanics are one-loop exact as a consequence of

the non-renormalization of the eight fermion terms. that the four derivative terms are

only generated at one-loop in four-dimensional yang-mills has been argued in [13,14,15,16].

note that our results are in accord with expectations from matrix theory [17].

in section three, we study the constraints imposed by supersymmetry on the twelve
fermion terms in the supersymmetric completion of v6. we show that these terms must

be two-loop exact for su (3). this agreement explains, in large part, why matrix the-

ory correctly reproduces the three body interactions of supergravity to this order in the

1 it is worth pointing out that most of the arguments that we will use do not depend on the

weyl group of su (n ). the results should therefore extend to any group with rank n  1.

2 it would be very interesting to perform a similar analysis for the eective action at a singu-

larity where part of the non-abelian gauge group remains unbroken.

velocity expansion [18,19,20].
it is important to determine whether the twelve fermion
terms completely determine the rest of the terms at order v6 [21]. hopefully, this can be
determined using the kinds of arguments developed in [11,12]. we suspect that this will

be the case for n = 2 and n = 3.

however, for higher rank gauge groups, we have not shown that the twelve fermion

terms are two-loop exact. rather, we are only able to show that special twelve fermion

structures are protected by non-renormalization theorems. supersymmetry does impose

restrictions on the remaining possible twelve fermion structures. these restrictions should,

for example, constrain the allowed tensor structures. however, it is not clear that the

constraints are sucient to completely determine the coupling constant dependence.

that certain twelve fermion terms might be renormalized beyond two-loops for n > 3

agrees with the perturbative computations in [22,23]. based on the results in [23], we
would expect arbitrary renormalizations of certain v6 structures for n > 3. in the nal
section, we describe the notion of generalized f-terms. we show that there are possible

structures at order eight in the derivative expansion which, for n > 3, must be generalized

f-terms. it seems likely that the terms found in [23] which agreed with supergravity are

in the supersymmetric completion of generalized f-terms.

2. constraining terms with four derivatives

2.1. grading the eight fermion terms

the lagrangian for the supersymmetric quantum mechanics contains bosonic elds xi
a
as well as fermions aa, where i = 1, . . . , 9 and a = 1, . . . , 16. the label a = 1, . . . , n 
1 denotes a particular element of the cartan sub-algebra of the gauge group g. the

lagrangian describing the dynamics at a generic at point has spin(9) w as a symmetry

group, where w is the weyl group of g. we will take g to be su (n ).

the spin(9) cliord algebra can be represented by real symmetric matrices i

ab, where

i = 1, . . . , 9 and a = 1, . . . , 16. these matrices satisfy the relation,

{i, j} = 2ij,

and a complete basis contains(cid:8)i, i, ij, ijk, ijkl(cid:9), where we dene:

ij =

(ij  ji)

1
2!
1
3!
1
4!

ijk =

ijkl =

(ijk  jik + . . .)

(ijkl  jikl + . . .).

2

(2.1)

(2.2)

the basis decomposes into symmetric(cid:8)i, i, ijkl(cid:9), and antisymmetric matrices(cid:8)ij, ijk(cid:9).
the lagrangian l can be written as a sum of terms l = p lk where lk contains

terms of order 2k in a derivative expansion. the order counts the number of derivatives

plus twice the number of fermions. supersymmetry requires the metric to be at [4,10].

the supersymmetry transformations then take the form,

xi

a = iia + n i

abb

aa = (ivi

a)a + (ma)a.

(2.3)

the terms n i and m encode all higher derivative corrections to the supersymmetry trans-

formations and  is a sixteen component grassmann parameter. note that once higher
derivative terms appear in l, we must have n i and m non-zero or the supersymmetry
algebra no longer closes. terms of order v4 which appear in l2 induce corrections to
the lowest order supersymmetry transformations of order 2 in n i and order 3 in m . to

determine the eight fermion terms, we will not need to know the detailed form of these

corrections.

following the argument for the su (2) case [4], we can immediately conclude that the

nine fermion terms which result by varying a boson in the eight fermion terms must vanish.

we then obtain sixteen rst order equations that must be satised by the eight fermion

terms,

a(cid:16)f (8)(x)(cid:17) = 0,

(2.4)

where we have schematically denoted the eight fermion terms by f (8)(x). our task is then

to unravel the extent to which (2.4) determines the eight fermion terms.

it is useful to grade the eight fermion terms in the following way: let us pick a preferred

direction in the cartan sub-algebra, say a = 1, with corresponding fermions a1. any
operator containing fermions can then be decomposed into pieces with xed numbers of

a1. we can then express the eight fermion terms in the form,

f (8)(x) =

f (8)

i

(x),

8xi=0

(2.5)

where the eight fermion term f (8)
straint (2.4) implies,

2.2. the homogeneity of the eight fermion terms

while the scalars are dimension 1. if f (8)

note that we have not yet summed on the a index in (2.9). the second term in (2.9)
contains operators that generate spin(9) rotations on the bosons and fermions. since f (8)
is a term in the lagrangian, it is spin(9) invariant. for f (8)
8 , this reduces to the assertion
that,

the last term in (2.11) can be written as 21(c) where c denotes the casimir operator
of spin(9) and 1 denotes the representation of spin(9) obtained from the product of eight
c1 fermions. since f (8)
is invariant under (2.11), this representation must be a polynomial
representation of spin(9). otherwise, we could not contract our eight fermions with scalars

2.3. evaluating the casimir

let us introduce some notation for the weights of spin(9). we will choose a cartan

sub-algebra, a weyl chamber and an orthonormal basis of weight vectors < w1, w2, w3, w4 >
for the vector representation of spin(9). the roots are constructed in terms of these weights

and the positive roots are wi  wj with i < j and wi. with this normalization, the sum of

the positive roots, 2, is given by:

2 = 7w1 + 5w2 + 3w3 + w4.

the 16 spinor representation of spin(9) then has highest weight,

1
2

(w1 + w2 + w3 + w4),

and all the weights of this representation are of the form 1
2 (w1  w2  w3  w4). the
product of eight fermions is the reducible representation 8 16. it is not hard to check

that 1(c) takes its largest value on the irreducible sub-representation with highest weight
4w1.

in fact, we will see below that the constraint equations force f (8)

to take values in this
representation.3 the value of the casimir on an irreducible subspace of highest weight 

8

is given by,

and 21(c) evaluated on f (8)

8

then gives:

<  + 2,  >,

2 < (7 + 4)w1 + 5w2 + 3w3 + w4, 4w1 >= 88.

equation (2.9) then becomes,

(cid:18)r

+ 11(cid:19) f (8)

(2.12)

and the solution is homogeneous of degree 11 as claimed.

this means that f (8)

is harmonic when restricted to any spin(9) invariant 9-dimensional

cartan of su (n ). borrowing a term referring to a similar concept from the theory of

several complex variables, we will call such functions pluri-harmonic.

we now show that f (8)

8 must lie in the subspace with highest weight 4w1. this
calculation will also be useful in our later analysis. we can choose coordinates for spin(9)
so that 12 is dual to the weight vector w1. since 12 squares to i, we can decompose
our fermions into eigenvectors of the 1  2 generator of spin(9) rotations on the fermions

given in (2.10),

aa = +

aa + 

aa,

aa and 

where +
are complex conjugates.

aa have eigenvalues +i/2 and i/2, respectively. note that +

likewise, we can decompose the canonical momenta pi

a obeying the usual commuta-

tion relations,

[xi

b] = iij ab,

into eigenvectors under the 1  2 generator of spin(9) rotations on the bosons also given
in (2.10). in this case, pj
a for j 6= 1, 2 is clearly annihilated by the rotation generator. the
remaining two momenta are conveniently written as,

for all . this implies that this highest weight component is either anti-holomorphic in the

z1 variable, or that it is annihilated by dz1 for all . the rst condition is not possible.

to see this, note that the eight fermion term can only be singular at a point where

non-abelian gauge symmetry is restored. these loci are codimension nine in the moduli

space. so as we go o to innity in almost all directions, the eight fermion term must

vanish. however, any anti-holomorphic function that is bounded almost everywhere is

constant. a constant eight fermion term is unphysical. we must therefore satisfy the
second condition. this condition means that the highest weight component of f (8)

is a

8

multiple ofq8

=1 dz1. this structure has weight 4w1 as we desired.

as a bonus, this argument shows that if f (8)

8 = 0 then f (8) = 0, because the highest
weight term with the greatest number of a1 factors must contain all 8 dz1 factors. since

3. constraining terms with six derivatives

3.1. the homogeneity of a special twelve fermion term

a(cid:16)f (12)(x)(cid:17) = al2.

(3.2)

all that we need to know about the source terms al2 is that they are generated by varying
terms of order v4 contained in l2 using corrections to the supersymmetry transformations,
encoded in n and m of (2.3), generated by these terms of order v4. the source terms in

(3.2) are therefore two-loop exact, and the corresponding solution to (3.2) will be the sum

of a two-loop exact term and a solution to the associated homogeneous equation

upper bound on the highest weight of the representations that can appear in the product

of 12 fermions. it is easy to check that the highest weight that can appear in the exterior

quired a negative power of the coupling constant and so was unphysical [5].

product of 12 fermions transforming in the 16 of spin(9) is 2w1. so the largest value of
the casimir term is,

21(c)  2(14 + 4) = 36.

this implies that f (12)
corresponds to a negative power of the coupling constant and is therefore again ruled out.
so at least the homogeneous solution for f (12)

has homogeneity 9 or larger. however, this scaling behavior

12 must vanish for any n .

but this equation no longer implies a relation analogous to (3.4).

we will therefore have to use a dierent strategy to constrain the remaining possible

twelve fermion terms. since f (12)
imax is killed by 1, we can reduce imax by applying 1
to f (12). moreover, this new twelve fermion term is still killed by each supercharge qa.
now applying a laplacian to the twelve fermion term only makes it decay more quickly.

so this modication decreases the homogeneity. this procedure should therefore give us a
lower bound on the homogeneity of f (12). we can keep repeating this procedure until all

terms in the resulting twelve fermion term are killed by 1.

having applied this procedure in the a = 1 direction, we can repeat the process along

all the other directions in the cartan sub-algebra until the resulting twelve fermion term,

let us call it ef (12), is pluri-harmonic. the second step involves operators q

here s is a representation of spin(9) and the vij are generators of spin(9). for example,

if k = 11 then s is the spinor representation. when k = 12  c, s is an irreducible
representation appearing in the cth power of the spinor representation.

we are left again with a casimir term, (r1 + r2)(c)  r1(c) + (s + r2)(c)  s(c).
from representation theory, we learn that on an irreducible representation with highest rj

weight of lj and highest s weight of l3, this term is bounded above by:

(l1 + l2 + 2, l1 + l2)  (l1 + 2, l1) + (l2 + l3 + 2, l2 + l3)

 (l3 + 2, l3) = 2(l1, l2) + 2(l2 + 2, l2) + 2(l3, l2).

(3.11)

our prior computations imply that l1 = 4w1. now we can work case by case: when
k = 12, we have l3 = 0 and l2  2w1 + 2w2. this gives a casimir term no bigger than 80
which implies homogeneity  20. this corresponds to a two-loop correction.

when k = 11, 2l2  3w1 + 3w2 + w3 + w4 and 2l3  w1 + w2 + w3 + w4. therefore

the casimir term is bounded by,

(w1 + w2 + w3 + w4, 3w1 + 3w2 + w3 + w4) = 66.

11

this implies homogeneity  22 for h(11) and therefore homogeneity  21 for the corre-
sponding part of the twelve fermion term f (12). if we assume, as is physically reasonable,

that the eective action is analytic in the coupling constant then this term is again gener-

ated at two-loops at worst.

when k = 10, l2  w1 + w2 + w3 and l3  w1 + w2 + w3 + w4. the casimir term is

now bounded by

(4w1, 2w1 + 2w2 + 2w3) + (8w1 + 6w2 + 4w3 + w4, 2w1 + 2w2 + 2w3)
+ 2|w1 + w2 + w3|2 = 50.

this gives homogeneity  25 for h(10) and  23 for the corresponding part of f (12).

this is a potential three-loop term.

when k = 9, the casimir term is bounded by 25. this implies homogeneity  22
for the corresponding term in f (12). again, this is at worst two-loop assuming analyticity

in the coupling constant.

when k = 8, we have the additional equations,

j
ass1


xj
2

h(k) = 0.

in a familiar way, we can extract the following relation:

(8r


r

 r1(vkj)(r1 + s)(vkj))h(k)

8,s = 0.

in this case, the casimir term is bounded by

(r1 + s)(c) + r1(c)  s(c)  2r1(c) + 2(r1, s)

= 104.

this gives homogeneity 9 for the corresponding term in f (12), which must then come

with an unphysical negative power of the coupling constant.

the one problematic case is k = 10 which could be generated at three loops. we will

now show that this potential three-loop term cannot occur. in obtaining the three-loop

bound, we assumed that the original twelve fermion term was pluri-harmonic. if it were

not pluri-harmonic, we would have to apply at least one laplacian to get a pluri-harmonic

term. if this were the case, then our homogeneity bound should be raised by 2 which gives

at most a two-loop correction, assuming analyticity in the coupling.

12

so let us consider a pluri-harmonic, weyl invariant twelve fermion term f (12)

i

. since

we are restricting to the n = 3 case, we have two scalar elds in the cartan which we
will label xj and yj. we can expand f (12)
form:

in spherical harmonics as a sum of terms of the

i

xiyj |x|72|i||y|72|j|.

the multi-indices i and j are to be contracted with indices on an appropriate twelve
fermion structure. the constraint equations then imply the existence of a term in f (12)
12i
of the form xlym |x|72|l||y|72|m |, where |l| = |i| + 12  2i and |m | = |j|  12 + 2i.
this implies that |i|  2i  12.

a three-loop term has homogeneity 23 and so 14 + |i| + |j| = 23, or |i| + |j| = 9.

this equality is incompatible with the previous bound on |i| when i > 10. so, we need

only consider imax = 10, 9 and 8.

we will eliminate these possible terms in a way which can also be used to get lower

bounds on loop corrections. recall that f (12)
imax
then have the weaker equation,

(3.12)

we have not used this equation for n > 2 because our invariance condition does not allow

us to compute the casimir term in general. however, we can estimate it. using spin(9)

invariance, we rewrite this equation in the form:

"(16  imax)r1

of the form xiyj |x|72|i||y|72|j|, the operator kj

on terms in f (12)
, is
bounded above by |j|(16  i). the rst casimir term, 21(c) is bounded above by 88 for
imax = 8, 84 for imax = 9 and 60 for imax = 10. we therefore see that the x1 homogeneity
given by 7  |i| is bounded below by 11  |j| for imax = 8, 12  |j| for imax = 9
and 10  |j| for imax = 10. using |i| + |j| = 9, |i| is bounded above by 13  |i| for
imax = 8, 14  |i| for imax = 9 and 12  |i| for imax = 10. this implies |i|  7. from this
bound, we can conclude that imax = 10 leads at most to a two-loop correction. moreover,
our constraints imply that for imax = 9, (|i|, |j|) = (7, 2) or (6, 3). weyl invariance then
implies that there must also be inadmissible solutions of the form (|i|, |j|) = (8, 1) or


xj

(9, 0). so imax = 9 leads to at most a two-loop correction. a similar argument shows that
imax = 8 also leads to at most a two-loop correction. therefore for n = 3, the twelve
fermion terms are two-loop exact.

4. generalized f-terms

our technique for nding supersymmetry constraints can be summarized as follows:

consider the terms at a given order in the velocity expansion with the largest number of
fermions. let us denote these top forms collectively by f (p). in the simplest case, f (p)

only contains fermions and no spacetime derivatives. using the lowest order free-particle
supersymmetry transformations, f (p) varys into a piece with one additional fermion and

a piece with one fewer fermion. in searching for constraints, we generally want to restrict

our attention to the piece with one additional fermion.

with this restriction, we can think of the supercharges qa as dierential operators

acting as,

qa = i

abbapi
a.

(4.1)

the restriction (4.1) neglects the supersymmetry variation of the fermions. the super-

symmetry constraints then follow from the sixteen equations,

qaf (p) = sa.

(4.2)

the sa are source terms obtained by varying lower order terms in the lagrangian using

corrections to the supersymmetry transformations, encoded in n, m of (2.3). typically,

only variations of lower order top forms appear in sa.

our theory always contains at least sixteen fermions so we always have top forms in
the supersymmetric completion of the v4 and v6 terms. as we have seen, the equations

(4.2) are strong enough to completely determine the coupling constant dependence of the

eight fermion terms for any n . for n = 3, the same is true for the twelve fermion terms

but this is no longer clear for higher n . for higher n , we should expect that only certain

terms at a given order in the velocity expansion will be constrained by (4.2). we gave an

example of such a term in section 3.1.

let us return momentarily to the su (2) case as an example. the top form in the
supersymmetric completion of v8 is a sixteen fermion term. there is a unique structure

that takes the form,

f (16) = f (r) a1    a16 a1a16 ,

for some radial function f . it is easy to check that f (16) can be written in the form,

f (16) = {q1,    {q16, g(r)}} ,

14

(4.3)

(4.4)

for some g(r), obtained by appropriately integrating f (r). the brackets appearing in (4.4)

should be viewed as graded commutators i.e. anti-commutators for two fermionic operators

and commutators for everything else. now the variation of (4.3) into a term with seventeen

fermions automatically vanishes since we only have sixteen fermions. from (4.2), we nd

no constraint on the choice of g(r).

top forms that can be written in the form (4.4) are natural generalizations of the

superspace notion of a d-term. while there is no useful notion of superspace for theories

with sixteen supercharges, it is still meaningful to ask whether a term in the lagrangian

 not necessarily a top form  can be written in the form (4.4). top forms that are

generalized d-terms in this sense are automatically killed by each qa. in searching for

supersymmetry constraints, we want to quotient out by these trivial solutions in the usual

cohomological sense. it is then natural to dene the set of generalized f-terms as all terms
that cannot be written in the form (4.4).6 since for su (2) all top forms at order eight in

the derivative expansion are clearly d-terms, we do not expect supersymmetry to impose

any simple restrictions on terms of this order.

however for higher rank, we have more fermions so there can be generalized f-terms

at higher orders in the derivative expansion of the most general eective action compatible

with sixteen supersymmetries and the global spin(9) symmetry. a strong indication of

the existence of such terms is the agreement of certain interactions in matrix theory with

supergravity found in [23]. we would hope that there is a simple argument showing that

the agreement is because of non-renormalization theorems. this is an important open

question.

we will conclude our discussion by showing that there are possible generalized f-terms
in the supersymmetric completion of v8 terms for n > 3. the argument goes as follows:
we can choose a basis for the gamma matrices i so that 9 is diagonal while the rest are

of the form,

(cid:18) 0 a
0(cid:19) ,

at

where a is some 8  8 matrix. so pii

abb can contain the fermions,

6 we wish to thank e. witten for suggesting this denition.

1, . . . , 8, a

15

for a  9. we are suppressing the cartan labels for the moment and just focusing on the
spin(9) indices. for a < 9, we see that pii

abb can contain the fermions,

a, 9, . . . , 16.

so, for example, 1 can only occur for nine choices of a. we could then consider a top
form,

1a1    1a16,

which is possible if the rank of the group is sixteen or larger. this term, which can appear

as part of some spin(9) invariant top form, clearly cannot be written as a generalized

d-term of the form (4.4). we can nd analogous examples in theories with lower rank.

let us take rank three: a sixteen fermion term with the following fermion content,

(1a11a21a3 2a12a2 2a3    5a1 5a25a3 )  6a3,

cannot be part of a generalized d-term. only fourteen qa could possibly contribute

1, . . . , 6 fermions but we need sixteen such fermions. it is not hard to construct more
examples of this kind.
