abstract

we present the algebraic framework for the quantization of the
classical bosonic charge algebra of maximally extended (n = 16) su-
pergravity in two dimensions, thereby taking the rst steps towards
an exact quantization of this model. at the core of our construction is
the yangian algebra y (e8) whose rt t presentation we discuss in de-
tail. the full symmetry algebra is a centrally extended twisted version
of the yangian double dy (e8)c. we show that there exists only one
special value of the central charge for which the quantum algebra ad-
mits an ideal by which the algebra can be divided so as to consistently
reproduce the classical coset structure e8(8)/so(16) in the limit  0.

introduction

dimensionally reduced gravity and supergravity are well known to possess
hidden symmetries [1, 2]. of special interest in this context is the case
of two dimensions, where these symmetries become innite dimensional,
generalizing the so-called geroch group of general relativity [3, 4, 5]. the
existence of innite dimensional symmetries in these models is intimately
linked to their integrability, which is borne out by the existence of linear
systems for their classical equations of motion, both for the bosonic models
[6, 7, 4] and their locally supersymmetric extensions [8, 9]. in this paper, we
will focus attention on the maximally extended n = 16 supergravity, whose
scalar sector is governed by an e8(8)/so(16) nonlinear -model, and whose
equations of motion admit a rigid non-compact e9(9) symmetry. 1

the canonical structure of these models and the lie-poisson realization
of the associated innite dimensional symmetries were analyzed only quite
recently [13, 14]. as shown there, the ane lie algebra seen at the level
of the classical equations of motion is converted into a quadratic algebra of
yangian type in the canonical formulation. one key feature of this result,
which we exploit in this paper, is that the quadratic algebra, and therefore at
least part of the model, can be quantized directly by replacing the poisson
algebra of charges by an exchange algebra involving a suitable r matrix,
whereas a standard eld theoretic quantization would appear to be pro-
hibitively dicult. the relevant r-matrix based on the exceptional group
e8 has already been derived in [15]. the structure that appears upon quan-
tization is the yangian y (e8). as a consequence, the physical states of the
quantized theory must belong to multiplets of y (e8) rather than multiplets
of the ane algebra e9 as one might have naively expected.

the yangian of the exceptional algebra e8 is distinguished from the yan-
gians of the classical lie algebras by the fact that its fundamental represen-
tation is reducible over e8, namely decomposes into 249 = 1 248. the
r-matrix associated to this representation has been given by chari and
pressley in [15]. using their result and the general analysis of drinfeld
[16] we obtain the rt t presentation of y (e8) which may be viewed [17] as
the quantization of group-valued e8 matrices endowed with the symplectic
structure of dimensionally reduced gravity. the full quantum structure that
appears upon quantization of the algebra of classical nonlocal charges is a
centrally extended twisted version of the yangian double, that reects the
e8(8)/so(16) coset structure of the classical model.

the presence of this extra coset structure and its quantum consistency
require further properties of the y (e8) r-matrix beyond those discussed
in [15]. we explain these in detail here.
in particular, for a discrete set

1this symmetry acts as a solution generating isometry group, or as a group of dress-

ing transformations [7, 10, 11, 12].

2

of values of the central extension, the algebra dy (e8)c possesses nontrivial
ideals which may be divided out to reduce the number of degrees of freedom.
remarkably there is only one among the altogether eight exceptional val-
ues of the central extension, which admits a non-trivial ideal for which the
quantum monodromy matrix becomes symmetric in the limit  0 and the
associated ideal can be consistently divided out to recover the classical coset
space e8/so(16) of n = 16 supergravity. the relevant value of the central
extension (c = 1 with our normalization) diers from the critical value c = 15
for which the quantum algebra admits an additional innite-dimensional
center [18].

the main open problem which remains is the compatibility of the local
supersymmetry constraints with the y (e8) charge algebra at the quantum
level. in this paper we have concentrated on the direct quantization of the
algebra of nonlocal charges which are classically invariant under supersym-
metry, i.e. poisson commute weakly with the supersymmetry generators. a
complete treatment should in addition contain a quantum version of the su-
persymmetry constraint algebra (an n = 16 superconformal algebra) which
could serve to dene the physical states as its kernel. the yangian structure
exhibited in this paper would then become a spectrum generating algebra
for n = 16 supergravity. let us emphasize, however, that the interplay be-
tween canonical constraints and non-local conserved charges in integrable
eld theories has so far not been studied at all at the quantum level, as
the existing literature deals exclusively with at space models rather than
the generally covariant and locally supersymmetric models we are concerned
with here.

our results underline the importance of quantum group structures for
dimensionally reduced gravity and supergravity. the ultimate aim here is
the identication of a quantum geroch group which would act on the
space of physical states in the same way as the classical geroch group acts
on the moduli space of classical solutions. the relevance of these structures
for string and m -theory seems also obvious. after all, the resulting symme-
tries can be regarded as quantum deformations of the innite dimensional
u -duality symmetries that have been conjectured to appear in compacti-
ed string and m -theory [19]. however, our results also indicate that some
widely held perceptions and expectations may need to be revised. in par-
ticular, the underlying symmetry of the full quantum theory may turn out
to be related to some (hyperbolic?) extension of y (e8), rather than just the
arithmetic duality groups e9(9)(z) and e10(10)(z).

2 e8 preliminaries

in this section we collect some basic facts on the exceptional algebra e8
thereby xing the notation for the following.
in particular, we give very

3

explicit expressions for the projectors onto the irreducible parts of the tensor
product of two adjoint representations of e8.

the generators of e8 in the adjoint (and thus fundamental) representation
are denoted by x a. we are here interested its non-compact maximally split
form with maximal compact subalgebra so(16), giving rise to the coset space
e8(8)/so(16). accordingly, we split e8 indices a, b, . . . as ([ij], a), . . ., with
i, j = 1, . . . , 16 and a = 1, . . . , 128 corresponding to the decomposition
248  120  128 of the adjoint representation of e8 into the adjoint and
the fundamental spinor representation of so(16). the generators satisfy the
commutation relations

[x a, x b] = f ab

c x c ,

(2.1)

with the convention that summation over antisymmetrized pairs of indices
[ij] is always accompanied by a factor 1

2 , viz.

x aya  x aya + 1

2 x ij yij .

the structure constants are most conveniently given in their fully antisym-
metric form obtained by raising the index c with the help of the cartan-
killing form ab. for the adjoint representation, the latter is dened by

ab := 1

60 tr (x ax b) = 1

60 f ac

df bd

c

which yields

ab = ab ,

ij kl = 2 ij

kl .

the e8 structure constants are then completely characterized by

f ij, kl, mn = 8 i[k l]j
m n ,

f ij, a, b =  1

2 ij
ab,

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

where the matrices ij
standard fashion

ab are obtained from the so(16) -matrices in the

a aj
i

ab = ij

ab + ij

ab.

(2.5)

the maximal compact subalgebra so(16) can be characterized alternatively
as the subalgebra invariant under the symmetric space involution

 (x a) = (x a)t .
for the formulation of the yang baxter equation we will need to deal
with operators acting acting on the tensor product 248248. the associ-
cd, where we refer to the indices ab as
ated matrices will be denoted as oab
incoming and to the indices cd as outgoing. the product of two such
matrices o and p is consequently given by

(2.6)

(op )ab

cd := oab

ef pef

cd .

4

as with the generators above, the cartan-killing metric must be used when-
ever indices are raised or lowered from their canonical position on such
matrices. we dene

21
oab

cd :=

oba

dc .

(2.7)

to write down the projectors we need the operators 11,  (i.e. the identity
and the exchange operator, respectively), and , which are given by

11ab

cd = c

a d

b , ab

cd = d

a c
b,

ab

cd = ab cd.

(2.8)

a further important operator is the symmetric casimir element dened in
the adjoint representation by

e8  ab x ax b

=  1

2 x ijx ij + x ax a  so(16)  so(16) + k  k .

(2.9)

in terms of the structure constants of e8, the casimir element can be alter-
natively expressed as

(e8)ab

cd = f e

cfeb

d .

a

we will also need the twisted casimir element 

e8, dened by


e8  abx a   (x b)

=  1

2 x ijx ij  x ax a ,

i.e. in indices:

(

e8)ab

cd = (e8)cb

ad = fea

cfeb

d .

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

the twisted casimir element is obviously not e8 but only so(16) invariant.
the tensor product of two adjoint representations of e8 splits into its
irreducible components according to 248248 = 1248387527000
30380. the corresponding projectors are given by:

,

(2.13)

248

p1 = 1
p248 = 1
p3875 = 1
p27000 = 1
p30380 = 1

 + 3  + 1

2 (e8 + e8)(cid:17) ,
4 (e8 + e8)(cid:17) ,

60 (e8  e8) .

to verify that these operators indeed satisfy orthogonal projection relations,
one needs the following relation

e8 = 12 11 + 12  + 12   20 e8 + 10 e8 ,
2

(2.14)

the e8 structure constants this relation becomes

all these projectors are manifestly symmetric w.r.t. interchange of the two

pj v  v = v  v pj ,

(2.16)

which together with the normalization detv = 1 can be taken as dening
relations for the group elements of e8.

3 r-matrix and the yangian y (e8)

here, we review the yangian algebra y (e8) and the r-matrix associated
to its fundamental representation 249 [15]. the yangian y (e8) [16] is
recursively dened as the associative algebra with generators x a and y a
(a = 1, . . . , 248) and relations

c x c ,

hx a,y bi = if ab
hx a,x bi = if ab
hy ahy b,x cii hx ahy b,y cii =  2labc ,

with labc = 1

c y c ,

(3.1)

it admits a nontrivial coproduct and antipode structure whose explicit form
will not be needed here, see e.g. thm. 12.1.1 of [20] for details.

due to the fact that labc does not vanish when the x a are evaluated in
the fundamental representation of e8, it is not possible to lift this represen-
tation of e8 to a representation of y (e8). rather, the minimal representation
of y (e8) is reducible over e8 and contains an additional trivial representation
of e8 [16]. with respect to so(16) we thus have the decomposition

249  1  120  128 .

(3.2)

for compactness of notation, we will label the extra singlet by 0 and use
hatted indices which run over all 249 dimensions, i.e. 0  a, b, . . .  248.

(3.5)

where the denition of the casimir element e8 is extended to 1248 by the
trivial (zero) action on the 1. we also impose the standard normalization
condition

r(0) =  .

(3.6)

within the tensor product 249 249 we introduce in addition to the op-
erators from (2.13) the projector p0 onto the one-dimensional space 1 1
and the projectors p+ and p onto the symmetric and antisymmetric part
of the space (248 1)  (1 248), respectively. furthermore, there are e8
invariant intertwining operators between subspaces of the same dimension,
which we denote by i01, i10, i+248, and i248+. they are dened by

i01i10 = p0
i+248i248+ = p+

i10i01 = p1 ,
i248+i+248 = p248 ,

(3.7)

respectively, up to relative factors between the intertwiners which drop out
in the above relations. explicitly, the new projectors and intertwiners are
given by

(p0)00
(p+)a0
(p)a0

00 = 1,
b0 = (p+)a0
b0 = (p)a0

0b = (p+)0a
0b =  (p)0a

with all other components vanishing. again all operators are symmetric
w.r.t. interchange of the two subspaces with the exception of the intertwiners
i+248 and i248+, which obey

(3.9)

as shown in [15], the r-matrix associated to the fundamental represen-

tation of y (e8) in terms of these projectors and intertwiners is given by

and its asymptotic behavior

f (w) = 1  2i

for w   .

(3.14)

it allows an explicit expression in terms of -functions which however is
not of particular interest for the following. observe that (3.13) and (3.14)
already imply the relations

f (w)f (w) = 1 ,

f (w) = f (w) .

the free parameter  which appears in the solution of the qybe is basi-
cally a consequence of the fact that the singlet in (3.2) may be rescaled with
an arbitrary factor; two r matrices (3.10) with dierent values of  are re-
lated by conjugation with diag(11
2 , 11120, 11128)  diag(11
2 , 11120, 11128).
without loss of generality we can thus x the parameter  to

602 := 1 .

(3.15)

for this value only, the r-matrix obeys the additional non-covariant relation

rab

c d(w) = rc d

ab(w) ,

(3.16)

which is proved by inspection and by use of the special (non-covariant)
property fa

bc of the e8(8) structure constants (2.4).

the following further properties of the r-matrix are easily veried:

bc = f a

12
r (w)

21

r (w) = 11,
12
r (w)  =

21

r (w) ,

(3.17)

(3.18)

where the second equation is only valid for imaginary , which is compatible
with our choice (3.15) above. in the context of two-dimensional scattering
theory, these relations express the requirements of unitarity and hermiticity
of the s-matrix, respectively. with indices written out they acquire the
following explicit form

c d(w) =

dc(w) .

(3.19)

(3.20)

the occurrence of poles at w = wj and relation (3.17) together imply that
r(w) is non-invertible at the points w = wj. more specically, (3.17)
yields the relations

12

rj

21

r (wj) = 0 .

9

(3.21)

from the formulae given above it is straightforward to check that the
residue r4 at w4 = 15i is singled out by its property of being proportional
to a one-dimensional projector:

(r4)ab

c d = 10

7 abc d ,

(3.22)

where ab denotes the natural extension of the cartan-killing form into
249  249 given by the additional entry 00 = 602 = 1. evaluating the
qybe (3.4) at uv = 15i then gives rise to the following relation

(r4)ab

ghrgc

pi(u)rhi

qr(u15i) = r

c (r4)ab

pq .

(3.23)

from these observations, we can deduce the crossing invariance property of
the r-matrix:

rb

a d

c(w)  agrbg

dh(w)hc = rcb

a d(15i  ww) .

(3.24)

the knowledge of the r-matrix associated to an irreducible representa-
tion of (3.1) now gives rise to another equivalent presentation of the yangian
b,
algebra itself [16]. consider the associative algebra with generators (t(n))a
(0  a, b  248), n  n and dening relations

(3.26)

the qybe (3.4) ensures compatibility of the exchange relations (3.25) with
associativity of the multiplication. their evaluation at u  v = 15i shows
that there exists an invariant scalar quantity q(t (u)), the quantum deter-
minant, which is bilinear in the matrix entries of t :

1
t (u+15i)

2
t (u) =

1

2
t (u)

q(t (u))r4 := r4

t (u+15i) r4 . (3.27)
using (3.23) one checks that q(t (u)) lies in the center of the algebra (3.25).
thus, we may pass to the quotient of this algebra over the two-sided ideal
generated by the central element by setting q(t ) = 1 or equivalently

ta

c(u  15i)tb

d(u)c d = ab .

(3.28)

it has been stated by drinfeld [16] that this quotient is isomorphic to the
yangian y (e8) as dened at the beginning of this section (3.1).2 the precise
2however, we presently cannot exclude the possibility that the center of (3.25) contains

elements of higher degree in the t s which are not generated by q(t ).

10

isomorphism requires knowledge of the universal r-matrix of y (e8) which
is certainly beyond our scope here; one may however easily identify the
generating elements x a and y a

(3.29)

x a = tr [x at(1)] ,
y a = tr (cid:2)x a(cid:0)t(2)  1

2 t(1)t(1)(cid:1)(cid:3) .

we can further expand (3.25) around u =  and use (3.5) to obtain the
commutator

t (1) ,

h 1

2

t (w)i = ihe8 ,

2

t (w)i ,

(3.30)

which in particular reproduces the rst two commutation relations of (3.1).
we close the general discussion here with two well-known properties of the
presentation (3.25) of the yangian

 any representation  of y (e8) denes a one-parameter family of rep-

resentations a labeled by a complex number a:

4 classical yangian symmetries in n = 16 super-

gravity

this section is a brief review of the classical symmetries and the algebra
of nonlocal charges in two-dimensional n = 16 supergravity [13, 14]. the
scalar sector of this model is described by an e8(8)-valued matrix v which
transforms under a global e8 symmetry and a local so(16) gauge symmetry
in the usual way

v(x) 7 gv(x)h(x) ,

g  e8(8) , h(x)  so(16) .

(4.1)

11

thus, its bosonic conguration space is given by the coset space e8(8)/so(16).
it may be parametrized by the symmetric e8-valued matrix

m  vv t ,

i.e. mab  va

cvb

c = mba ,

(4.2)

which is evidently gauge (= so(16)) invariant. the symmetry of m may
be characterized algebraically by the fact that it is annihilated by the anti-
symmetric projectors

(p248)ab

cdmcd = 0 = (p30380)ab

cdmcd ,

(4.3)

whereas for the symmetric projectors from (2.15) one nds the following
identities

(p1)ab
(p3875)ab
(p27000)ab

cdmcd = 1
cdmcd = 0 ,
cdmcd = mab  1

31 ab .

31 ab  abmab = 8 ,

(4.4)

to verify these relations one needs the e8-invariance of the projectors and
the cartan-killing form:
cdmcd = va

d cd = ab .

d(pj)cd

(pj)ab

va

cvb

cvb

ee ,

the second relation in (4.4) requires the additional formula

f d

acfdbc = (cid:26) 8ij

0

kl if (ab) = (ij, kl)

otherwise

where the summation over the e8 index c is with the wrong metric (i.e.
with the so(16)-covariant ab rather than ab).

the scalar elds represented by the matrix m satisfy equations of motion
which allow a lax pair formulation [7, 6, 4, 8, 9] similar to the principal chiral
model.
in particular this allows the construction of an innite family of
nonlocal integrals of motion which are obtained from the transition matrices
associated to the lax pair [13, 14]. these integrals of motion are encoded
in a symmetric e8-valued matrix m(w) obtained by integrating the lax
connection over certain space intervals and depending on a complex spectral
parameter w. this matrix parametrizes the full scalar sector of the phase
space in the sense that for real values of w the matrix m(w) coincides with
the physical scalar elds m(x) evaluated on the particular axis in space-time
where the dilaton eld  vanishes

m(w) = m(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(x)=0, (x)=w

.

(4.5)

this relation has been formulated in the coordinate system where the two-
dimensional world-sheet is parametrized by the dilaton eld  and its dual

12

axion . for instance, for cylindrically symmetry spacetimes the matrix
m(w) carries the values of physical scalar elds along the symmetry axis.

we may further introduce its riemann-hilbert decomposition

mab(w)  u+(w)a

c u(w)b

c ,

(4.6)

into e8-valued functions u(w) which are holomorphic in the upper and
the lower half of the complex w-plane, respectively. they are related by
complex conjugation

(u+(w)) = u(w) .

(4.7)

in [13, 14] it was shown that these phase space quantities are subject to

the following symplectic structure:

{mab(v) , mcd(w)} =

(4.8)

1

v  w(cid:16)(e8)ac
 mam(v)(

mnmmb(v)mnd(w) + mam(v)mcn(w) (e8)bd
mdmnb(v)(cid:17) ,
e8)mc

bnmnd(w)  mcm(w) (

e8 )an

mn

with e8 and 
e8 from (2.10) and (2.12), respectively. one may check that
these poisson brackets are covariant under e8 and compatible with the sym-
metry of m (4.3), as required for consistency. for the purpose of quantiza-
tion to be addressed in the next section it is further convenient to decompose
this structure according to (4.6) into the following brackets

(cid:26) 1
u (v) ,
(cid:26) 1
u (v) ,

2

u (w)(cid:27) = (cid:20) 2e8
v  w

u (w)(cid:21) ,
u (w)

u (v)

(4.9)

2

u (w)

v  w

.

in a theory with local symmetries, observables such as the conserved non-
local charges contained in u(w) must weakly commute with the associated
canonical constraints. for the above charges this was shown to be the case
in [14]. namely, for the traceless components t  := t  1
 of the
energy momentum tensor (generating local translations along the lightcone),
we simply have

2 g t 

nt  (z) , u(w)o = 0 .

(4.10)

this relation expresses the invariance of the charges u(w) under general
coordinate transformations, which thus indeed constitute observables in
the sense of dirac.

in supergravity, we have in addition the constraints si

(z) generating
n = 16 local supersymmetry transformations ( is a spinor index in two
dimensions). as shown in [14], the relations expressing the invariance of the

13

charges u(w) under local supersymmetry are considerably more compli-
cated than (4.10). recalling that the integrals of motion u(w) are obtained
from certain transition matrices u (x, y; w) associated to the lax pair of the
model, we found that they obey poisson bracket of the following type (for
x < z < y):

nu (x, y; w), si

(z)o  u (x, z; w) x ij sj

(z) u (z, y; w) ,

(4.11)

which vanish indeed on the constraint surface si
(x) = 0. apart from ques-
tions of operator ordering, it is clear from the form of (4.11) that the com-
bined algebra of nonlocal charges and supersymmetry constraints does not
close. it remains an open problem at this point whether one can arrive at a
closed structure upon sucient enlargement of the algebra. its quantization
would entail the existence of a novel type of exchange relations between the
conserved charges and the local supersymmetry constraints. the full algebra
should then contain the yangian charge algebra to be presented in the next
section as well as a quantized version of the n = 16 superconformal algebra,
into which the supersymmetry constraints close. note however, that a con-
sistent quantum formulation of the latter is a highly nontrivial task due to
the nonlinear nature of the n = 16 superconformal algebra. for instance,
 and in contrast to the standard extended superconformal algebras  free
eld realizations are not even known at the classical level.

5 quantization

we now wish to quantize the symplectic structure of the classical charge
algebra by means of the r-matrix described above. this amounts to re-
placing the poisson brackets (4.9) by quantum exchange relations, leading
to a twisted yangian double with central extension c. more precisely, we
employ the construction (3.25) to replace the classically conserved non-local
charges u(w) (which by their denition are 248  248 matrices) by a cor-
responding set of 249  249 matrices t(w) with operator-valued entries
subject to the exchange relations

i.e. by interchanging the two subspaces and taking the transpose of the orig-
inal r-matrix in one of them. the interchange of subspaces here is necessary

12

r6=

21
because
r. it is easy to check that the above denition yields the cor-
rect rst order term displayed in (5.3). furthermore, although transposing
the indices is a non-covariant operation, it turns out that all summations in
(5.4) are again covariant, such that with a little algebra these relations can
be reduced to the original qybe (3.4).

we emphasize that the shift c (alias the central charge) in (5.2) is com-
patible with all of our requirements so far and therefore still arbitrary at this
point. it is important here that the algebras for dierent c are not isomor-
phic; in particular, they may have dierent ideals. the central charge c will
be xed later by requiring symmetry of the quantum monodromy matrix.
note that a possible additional shift in the argument of q in (5.5) has been
absorbed into a redenition of t.

as for the singular points, there is an important dierence between (5.1)
and (5.2): whereas the poles on the l.h.s. and r.h.s. of (5.1) always match,
this is not so for (5.2) due to the shift. thus, either some of the mixed
operator products are singular, or the regularity on one side imposes the
vanishing of certain residues on the other side. these questions as well as
the proper quantum analogue of the classical holomorphy properties of the
ts may however only be addressed after specializing to a particular repre-
sentation of (5.1), (5.2). to be on the safe side here, we will use the exchange
relations only at the generic points where the r-matrices are nonsingular.

in addition to these exchange relations we demand that the quantum

determinant for both t+ and t be equal to unity, viz. (3.28)

t(w  15i)a

c t(w)b

d c d = ab .

(5.6)

due to (3.13), q in (5.5) is normalized such that the l.h.s. of this equation
indeed lies in the center of the full algebra (5.1), (5.2). the hermiticity
(3.18) of the r-matrix shows that the full quantum algebra is compatible
with the following -structure  suggested by the classical relation (4.7) 
(5.7)

b ,

(cid:16)t(w)a

b(cid:17) = t(w)a

15

for the purely imaginary choice of the parameter  we have made.3

let us show that the algebra (5.1)(5.7) has the correct classical limit
  0. if we embed the original non-local charges u(w) by identifying them
with the upper left 248  248 block of t(w), the exchange relations (5.1),
(5.2) reduce to the poisson brackets (4.9) in the limit   0. the u(w)
being e8-valued matrices, the condition (5.6) can then be viewed as the
quantum analog of the statement that any element of e8(8) also belongs to
so(128, 120). while this submatrix of t is evidently the quantum analog
of the classical charges, one may wonder about the signicance of the extra
0(w). the exchange relations
components t0
may be read in such a way, that the o-diagonal components can be solved to
become functions of the 248 degrees of freedom originally present. in order
to make the dependence explicit, we evaluate the dening relation (3.25) at
the remaining poles u v = wj (j = 1, . . . , 3) (the residue at w4 has already
been exploited to derive (3.28)):

after expansion around u =  this equation can be solved order by order

respectively. in rst order this yields

together with (3.30), (3.28) and the explicit form of the residues of the
r-matrix (3.12) these relations can be used to deduce

(5.9)

3it is helpful to note that like for g = sl2 [13] the algebra (5.1), (5.2) may in fact
be mapped to the usual (untwisted) centrally extended yangian double dy (e8)c by the
(noncovariant) map

b

t+(w)a

7 t+(w)a

ccb ,

b

t(w)a

7 t(w)a

b .

the additional relation (3.16) is required to show that this is indeed an automorphism of
(5.1). with respect to (5.7) this map is, however, no -isomorphism; the representation
theory of (5.1), (5.2) will thus dier considerably from the one of dy (e8)c. (needless to
say that even the latter is far from being developed.)

16

in this fashion one may in principle determine the components t (w)0
in all orders as functions of the t (w)a
  0. thus, we have consistently
(cid:18) u(w)a

b which vanish in the classical limit

recall now that the classical phase space was parametrized by the sym-
metric e8-valued matrix mab(w). on the quantum side we dene this object
in analogy to (4.6) as

mab(w)  t+(w)a

c t(w)b

c ,

(5.11)

where the operator ordering on the r.h.s.
is xed by this relation. the
matrix entries of m are distinguished elements in the algebra (5.1), (5.2) in
that they satify the exchange relations

as well as the closed algebra

kl(vwic) ml d(w) =

(5.12)

(5.13)

mb m(w) rka

mn(wvic) mnl(v) r dc

kl(wv) ,

which we hence view as the quantized version of (4.8).4

while the classical matrix m was manifestly symmetric (cf. (4.3), (4.4))
this is not necessarily true for its quantum analog. rather, we must now
impose some quantum version of this condition in order to ensure that the
number of degrees of freedom in the quantum structure matches the clas-
sical phase space. in other words, we still have to implement the quantum
analogue of the classical coset structure. in algebraic language this amounts
to dividing out another ideal from (5.1)(5.2). unlike the quantum deter-
minant condition (5.6) (which we still assume to hold), this new condition
will involve t+ and t simultaneously.

to this end we return to the exchange algebra (5.1)(5.2) with arbitrary,

but xed central charge c, and consider the set of elements

ab(w) 

c d(v) mc d(w)

rab

res(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)v=ic
c d(ic)mc d(w)

rab




if r(ic) is singular

(5.14)

else .

4like its classical counterpart (4.8) the algebra (5.13) belongs to the general class of

quadratic algebras which has been considered in [21].

17

use of the exchange relations (5.12) then yields in a rst step

t+(u)c

d ab(w) =

= rab

pq(ic)rpc

mk(wu)rqk

nl(wuic) m mn(w) t+(u)l
d .

the necessity of the choice v = ic in (5.14) becomes evident at this point:
it is the only value of the argument of the r-matrix in (5.14) for which we
can exploit the qybe to re-arrange the indices (this would not be possible
pq(v) with arbitrary argument v).
if the rst factor on the r.h.s. were rab
thus, by use of (3.4) we nally obtain

= rbc
= rbc

qk(wuic)rak
qk(wuic)rak

pl(wu)rpq
pl(wu) pq(w) t+(u)l
d .

mn(ic) m mn(w) t+(u)l

d

(5.15)

a similar calculation for t(u) gives the same result. we conclude that
the elements ab(w) constitute the basis of a two-sided ideal of (5.1)(5.2).
obviously, these ideals are nontrivial only if (5.14) does not contain m
entirely, i.e. only if r(ic) or the relevant residue is singular or non-invertible.
this happens only at the special values c = wj.5
there is (of course) a more group-theoretical interpretation of this con-
struction: in view of (3.32) and (3.33), the exchange relations (5.12) express
the fact, that under the adjoint action of t+(v) and t(v), respectively, the
matrix m(w) transforms in the tensor product 249w  249wic. i.e. the
existence of nontrivial ideals in m amounts to the reducibility of the tensor
product 249ic  249 which is in correspondence with the singular points of
the associated r-matrix [15] as we have explicitly seen here.
returning to the problem of identifying the proper quantum analogue
of the symmetry of m, let us now examine (5.14) for all critical choices of
the central extension c with the desired conditions (4.3), (4.4). with the
explicit form of (3.12) one conrms that there is a unique value of c such
that the algebra (5.1)(5.2) has an ideal which in the classical limit indeed
reduces to (4.3) and (4.4). the correct choice is

c = 1 .

(5.16)

dividing out the ideal corresponding to (5.14) now amounts to imposing the
additional set of relations ab = 0, or

(r1)ab

c dmc d(w) = 0 .

(5.17)

5together with the fact (3.22) that r4 is proportional to a one-dimensional projector,
(5.15) in particular shows the well-known innite-dimensional enlargement of the center
of the algebra (5.1)(5.2) at the critical level c = 15 [18]. however, to achieve consistency
with the classical coset structure e8/so(16) we need another value of the central extension
here.

18

the ensuing relations can be written more succinctly by splitting r1 into
the e8-invariant projectors:

c(m0c + mc0) ,

(5.18)

(p248)ab
(p3875)ab
(p30380)ab

8 fab

cdmcd =  
cdmcd = 0 ,
cdmcd = 0 ,
m0c = mc0 ,
m00 =  1

4802 abmab .

since the o-diagonal components m0a are of order o() by (5.10), it now
follows with our choice 602 = 1 that the relations (5.18) indeed encompass
the classical coset relations (4.3) and (4.4) in the limit   0.
in conclusion, the quantum algebra which replaces the classical poisson
algebra (4.9) is given by (5.1)(5.7) with central extension c = 1 divided
by the ideal which is generated by (5.18). the operator (5.11) consistently
represents the quantum analogue of the classical matrix m(w) related to
the physical scalar elds on a certain axis in space-time. matrix elements of
(5.11) in particular representations should thus carry the information about
quantum spectra and uctuations of the original elds. these issues as well
as the general representation theory of the twisted yangian doubles remain
to be investigated.
