abstract

the irreducible hamiltonian brst symmetry for p-form gauge
theories with stueckelberg coupling is derived. the cornerstone of our
approach is represented by the construction of an irreducible theory
that is equivalent from the point of view of the brst formalism with
the original system. the equivalence makes permissible the substitu-
tion of the brst quantization of the reducible model by that of the
irreducible theory. our procedure maintains the lorentz covariance
of the irreducible path integral.

1 introduction

it is well-known that the hamiltonian brst formalism [1][2] stands for one
of the strongest and most popular quantization methods for gauge theories.
in the irreducible context the ghosts can be interpreted like one-forms dual to
the vector elds corresponding to the rst-class constraints. this geometrical
interpretation fails within the reducible framework due to the fact that the

vector elds are no longer independent, hence they cannot form a basis. the
redundant behaviour generates the appearance of ghosts with ghost number
greater than one, traditionally called ghosts for ghosts, of their canonical
conjugated momenta, named antighosts, and, in the meantime, of a pyrami-
dal non-minimal sector. the former objects, namely, the ghosts for ghosts,
ensure a straightforward incorporation of the reducibility relations within
the cohomology of the exterior derivative along the gauge orbits, while their
antighosts are required in order to kill the higher resolution degree non trivial
co-cycles from the homology of the koszul-tate dierential.

a representative class of redundant systems is given by p-form gauge
theories, that play an important role in string and superstring theory, su-
pergravity and the gauge theory of gravity [3][8], attracting much attention
lately on behalf of some interesting aspects, like their characteristic coho-
mology [9] or their applications to higher dimensional bosonisation [10]. the
study of theoretical models with p-form gauge elds give an example of so-
called topological eld theory and lead to the appearance of topological
invariants, being thus in close relation to space-time topology, hence with
lower dimensional quantum gravity [5]. in the meantime, antisymmetric ten-
sor elds of various orders are included within the supergravity multiplets
of many supergravity theories [6], especially in 10 or 11 dimensions.
it is
known that the d = 11 supergravity is regarded as a sector of m-theory
unication. of the many special properties of d = 11 supergravity the most
interesting is that it forbids a cosmological term extension in the context
of lower-dimensional structures due precisely to the 4-form or dual 7-form
necessary to balance the degrees of freedom [7]. the construction of dual
lagrangians involving p-forms is appears naturally in general relativity and
supergravity in order to render manifest the sl(2, r) symmetry group of sta-
tionary solutions of einsteins vacuum equation, respectively to reveal some
subtleties of exact solutions for supergravity [8]. interacting p-form gauge
theories have been analyzed from the redundant hamiltonian brst point of
view in [11], where the ghost and auxiliary eld structures required by the
antield brst formalism are derived.

the purpose of this paper is to give a general irreducible approach to
p-form gauge theories with stueckelberg coupling in the hamiltonian frame-
work. this problem is solved mainly by replacing the original redundant
hamiltonian rst-class system by an irreducible one, and by further quantiz-
ing the resulting theory in the hamiltonian brst context. the irreducible

2

rst-class system is obtained by imposing that all the antighost number one
co-cycles of the reducible koszul-tate dierential should identically vanish
under a suitable redenition of the antighosts at antighost number one, and
also by requesting that the number of physical degrees of freedom of the
irreducible theory to be equal with that of the original reducible system.
initially, we analyze quadratic p-form gauge theories with stueckelberg cou-
pling [12], and then extend the results to the interacting case. the mo-
tivation for analyzing the stueckelberg coupling and not the simpler case
of free abelian p-forms is twofold. first, the stueckelberg coupling is in-
volved with the quantization of massive p-forms [12], and second, this class
of models presents non-diagonal reducibility matrices as opposed to the free
situation, which makes their irreducible treatment more interesting from the
quantization point of view. moreover, the free case can be obtained from the
stueckelberg coupling in the limit m = 0 (see (1)). the idea of converting
a reducible hamiltonian rst-class theory into an irreducible one appears in
[2] and [13], but it has not been either consistently developed or applied so
far to the quantization of reducible rst-class hamiltonian systems.

our paper is structured in four sections. section 2 is dealing with the
derivation of an irreducible hamiltonian rst-class system corresponding to
the starting quadratic p-form gauge theory with stueckelberg coupling on
account of homological arguments, emphasizing that we can substitute the
hamiltonian brst quantization of the original redundant model by that of
the irreducible theory. in the end of this section we infer the path integral
for the irreducible system in the context of the hamiltonian brst quanti-
zation. section 3 investigates the extension of the analysis from section 2
to the interacting case. in view of this, we propose a model of irreducible
hamiltonian theory associated to that in section 2, and further determine
its lagrangian version, which relies on the original action and some lorentz
covariant irreducible gauge transformations. the interacting case is then ad-
dressed employing the above mentioned lagrangian version as an appropriate
starting point. section 4 ends the paper with some conclusions.

2 irreducible analysis of abelian p- and (p  1)-

forms with stueckelberg coupling

in this section we derive the path integral of abelian p- and (p  1)-forms with
stueckelberg coupling following an irreducible approach. thus, we begin with
the canonical analysis of the model, which is described by a quadratic la-
grangian action and displays a (p  1)-stage reducible rst-class constraint
set.
in subsection 2.2 we construct some irreducible rst-class constraints
associated with the original ones by means of homological arguments. more
precisely, we require that all the non trivial antighost number one co-cycles
of the reducible koszul-tate dierential identically vanish under a suitable
redenition of the antighost number one antighosts while preserving the orig-
inal number of physical degrees of freedom. the analysis is performed for
p = 2 and p = 3, in order to emphasize various aspects of graduate com-
plexity, which will be employed in order to generalize our results to arbitrary
p. in this manner, we arrive at an irreducible set of rst-class constraints,
a corresponding rst-class hamiltonian and an irreducible koszul-tate dif-
ferential associated with the starting reducible model. with these elements
at hand, we construct in subsection 2.3 the irreducible brst symmetry and
show that it exists as it satises the general requirements of the homological
perturbation theory.
in the next subsection we elucidate the relationship
between the reducible and irreducible brst symmetries by proving that the
physical observables deriving from the two contexts coincide, such that it is
permissible to replace the hamiltonian brst quantization of the original
reducible model by that of the resulting irreducible theory. in subsection 2.5
we apply the hamiltonian brst formalism to the irreducible model by using
a proper non-minimal sector and a gauge-xing fermion that nally lead to
a manifestly covariant path integral.

throughout the paper we work with the conventions f i1im = f if m = 0
and f i1im = 0 if m < 0. this ends the canonical analysis of this model.

2.2 irreducible constraints

the rst step of our analysis consists in the derivation of an irreducible rst-
class theory associated with the original reducible one, which, in addition,
preserves the initial number of physical degrees of freedom. in view of this we
construct some irreducible rst-class constraints starting with the reducible
constraints (67). clearly, the case p = 1 is irreducible and in consequence
it will be not discussed in the sequel. for a deeper understanding of our pro-
cedure we initially expose the case p = 2, subsequently explore the situation
p = 3, and nally generalize our results to an arbitrary p.

2.2.1 the case p = 2

in this case the constraints (67) take the form

g(2)

i  2jji + mi  0, g(2)  ii  0,

and are rst-stage reducible

ig(2)

i + mg(2) = 0.

the reducible brst symmetry

sr = r + r +    ,

(14)

(15)

(16)

contains two basic dierentials. the rst one, r, named the koszul-tate
dierential, realizes an homological resolution of smooth functions dened

6

on the constraint surface, while the second one, r, represents a model of
longitudinal derivative along the gauge orbits and accounts for the gauge
invariances (generated by the rst-class constraints).
in order to realize a
proper construction of r we set the action of this operator on all phase-space
variables to vanish and introduce some new generators, called antighosts and
denoted by p2i, p2, and , accordingly to which we dene

rp2i = g(2)

i

, rp2 = g(2),

r = ip2i  mp2.

(17)

(18)

while p2i and p2 are fermionic elds of antighost number one, the antighost
 is bosonic and possesses antighost number two. the antighost  is required
in order to make the co-cycle

 = ip2i + mp2,

(19)

r-exact, which will establish the acyclicity of the koszul-tate dierential.
our main idea of passing to an irreducible treatment is to redene the
antighosts p2i and p2 in such a way that the new co-cycle of the type (19)
vanishes identically. if we implement this step, the new co-cycle at antighost
number one will be trivially (identically vanishing) without introducing ,
hence the resulting theory will be indeed irreducible. the redenition of the
antighosts is performed through

p2i 


p 2i= dj

ip2j + dip2, p2  p2 = djp2j + dp2,

(20)

where the quantities dj

i, di, dj and d are taken to satisfy the equations

idj

i + dj = 0, i di + md = 0,

dj

ig(2)

j + dig(2) = g(2)

i

, djg(2)

j + dg(2) = g(2).

(21)

(22)

taking into account (17), (20) and (22), after simple computation we nd
that

(23)



p 2i= g(2)

i



, 


p 2= g(2).


from (23) we obtain that the co-cycle of the type (19),  = i
p 2,
vanishes identically due to (21). we redenoted the koszul-tate dierential


p 2i +m

7

by  in order to emphasize that it corresponds to an irreducible situation. in
this way our scope, namely, to make  vanish, can be attained if the system
(2122) is solvable. the solution to this system exists and is given by

dj

i = j

i 

ji
 + m 2 , dj = m

j

m 2

where  = kk. replacing (2425) in (23) we arrive at

the last relations describe the action of  corresponding to an irreducible
model subject to some irreducible rst-class constraints to be further deter-
mined. at this point we explore the requirement that the number of physical
degrees of freedom should be preserved by passing to the irreducible theory.
as the number of independent constraint functions (14) is equal to (d  1)
and that of independent constraint functions implicitly involved with (2627)
is d, it results that we need an extra degree of freedom for the irreducible
theory. we denote this supplementary degree of freedom by (a, ), with 
the non-vanishing solution to the equation

(cid:16) + m 2(cid:17)  = (cid:16)jp2j + mp2(cid:17) .

(28)

due to the invertibility of ( + m 2), the non-vanishing solution for  en-
forces the irreducibility because the equation (28) possesses non-vanishing
solutions if and only if  (jp2j + mp2) 6= 0, hence if and only if (19) is not
a co-cycle. making use of (2628) we get that

p2i = g(2)

i + i, p2 = g(2) + m.

(29)

the above relations are nothing but the denitions of  on the antighost
number one antighosts corresponding to an irreducible theory subject to the
irreducible rst-class constraints

(2)
i  2jji + mi  i  0, t (2)  ii  m  0.

(30)

this solves the problem of constructing some irreducible rst-class constraints
deriving from (14) in the case p = 2.

it seems that our irreducible approach gives raise to some problems linked

with locality.

indeed,


p 2i and


p 2, explicitly written in (2627), contain

a non-local term. this is not a surprise as



p a0= (cid:18) 

p 2i,



p 2(cid:19) are nothing
m !,

but the transverse part of pa0 = (p2i, p2) with respect to z a0 =   i


i.e., z a0
p a0= 0, and it is known that the decomposition into transverse
and longitudinal components generates non-locality. on the other hand, the
solution of the equation (28) is generally non-local. however, the non-locality
of the solution to (28) compensates in a certain sense the non-locality present
in (2627) such that the resulting irreducible constraints (30) (inferred via
(29)) are local. anticipating a bit, in the case of p  3 the redenition
of the antighosts will consequently imply some transverse-type conditions
with respect to the corresponding reducibility functions which lead to some
non-local solutions. in order to compensate this non-locality and to further
obtain some local irreducible constraints it will be also necessary to add some
supplementary degrees of freedom that check some equations of the type (28).
in general, the lack of locality in the brst formalism can occur if the brst
charge or the gauge-xing fermion are non-local. as it will be seen below,
this does not happen in the context of our procedure (see (119) and (121)).

2.2.2 the case p = 3

the guide line in this situation is the case p = 2. however, we will see that
some new features arise. the starting reducible constraints have the form

g(2)

ij  3kkij + mij  0, g(2)

i  2jji  0.

the denition of the reducible koszul-tate dierential reads as

rp2ij = g(2)

ij , rp2i = g(2)

i

,

ri = 2jp2ji  mp2i, r = ip2i,

r = ii + m,

9

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

where p2ij and p2i are fermionic of antighost number one, i and  are
bosonic with antighost number two, and  is fermionic of antighost number
three. the antighosts i and  must be introduced in order to enforce the
r-exactness of the antighost number one co-cycles

i = 2jp2ji + mp2i,  = ip2i,

(35)

while the presence of  solves the exactness of the antighost number two
co-cycle

 = ii  m.

(36)

we apply the same idea like before, namely, we demand that i and  are
no longer co-cycles in the irreducible context (described in terms of the ir-
reducible koszul-tate operator ), so they must be no longer -closed. this
request can be satised if we add some new bosonic canonical pairs (ai, i),
(h, ) and impose that the momenta i and  are the non-vanishing solu-
tions to the equations

(cid:16)2jp2ji + mp2i(cid:17) = (cid:16) + m 2(cid:17) i,

(cid:16)ip2i(cid:17) = (cid:16) + m 2(cid:17) .

(37)

(38)

from (37) we get that  (mip2i) = ( + m 2) ii, which combined with
(38) leads to

ii  m = 0,

(39)

on behalf of the invertibility of ( + m 2). the last relation is a new con-
straint of the irreducible theory that ensures the preservation of the physical
degrees of freedom with respect to the initial model.
indeed, the number
of independent constraints (31) is (d  1) (d  2) /2. by contrast, in the
irreducible framework we will nd precisely (d  1) (d  2) /2 + (d  1) ir-
reducible constraints corresponding to (31) and a supplementary number of
phase-space variables (ai, i), (h, ), which is equal to 2d. thus, in order
to re-obtain the original number of degrees of freedom, it is necessary to
add an extra constraint, which forms together with the others an irreducible
rst-class set. this constraint is nevertheless oered precisely by (39) and
will be denoted by

(2)  ii + m  0.

(40)

10

we remark that from the entire set of rst-class constraints (31) and (40),
the latter is already irreducible, so its presence does not imply further co-
cycles at antighost number one. the antighost corresponding to (40), p2, is
fermionic, has the antighost number equal to one, and must satisfy

p2 = (2).

(41)

at this stage we redene the antighost number one antighosts in order to
make the co-cycles of the type (35) to vanish identically. the redenition
reads as

which together with (40) form the searched for irreducible set associated with
(31). the new feature arising in the p = 3 case is given by the appearance
of the new constraint (40). like in the case p = 2, the non-locality present
in (3738) compensates the non-locality produced by (4950) in (48). we
will see that in the more complex situations p  4 we have to add more
constraints instead of (40).

2.2.3 generalization to arbitrary p

acting along the line exposed above, we introduce the antisymmetric canon-
ical pairs

(cid:16)aj1...jp2k2, j1...jp2k2(cid:17) ,(cid:16)h j1...jp2k3, j1...jp2k3(cid:17) ,

(54)

for k  0 in order to prevent the appearance of any antighost number one co-
cycle, and, by using some homological arguments similar with the previous
ones, we construct the tower of irreducible rst-class constraints associated
with (67) under the form

c = ( p

(55)

(56)

(57)

at this moment the constraints of the irreducible theory are expressed by
(45) and (5556).

due to the fact that we intend to develop a covariant irreducible approach,
it is necessary to further enlarge the phase-space by adding the antisymmetric
canonical pairs

(cid:16)a0j1...jp2k1, 0j1...jp2k1(cid:17) ,(cid:16)h 0j1...jp2k2, 0j1...jp2k2(cid:17) ,

for k  1, which we impose to be constrained by

0j1...jp2k1  0, 0j1...jp2k2  0, k  1.

(58)

(59)

in this manner, the constraints of the irreducible theory are expressed by
(5556) and also by

at the level of the extended action of the initial model the gauge varia-
tions of the lagrange multipliers for the reducible constraints contain some
supplementary gauge parameters due to the reducibility, which ensure the
covariance of the lagrangian gauge transformations. on the contrary, in the
framework of our irreducible treatment these additional gauge parameters are
absent because of the irreducibility. this is why we cannot yet build a model
of irreducible extended formalism that outputs some covariant lagrangian
gauge transformations. in order to restore the covariance, it is necessary to

with k  0. in addition, we set the constraints

(1)

i1...ip2k2  0, k = 0, . . . , c,

i1...ip2k3  (1)

i1...ip2k3  0, k = 0, . . . , d,

where

d = ( p

p3

it is well-known that one can always redene the surface of rst-class con-
straints up to a linear combination of constraints whose coecients form an
invertible matrix. in this respect, we remark that the canonical momenta
can be expressed with the help of

(cid:16)i1...ip2k2(cid:17)k=0,...,c

and (cid:16)i1...ip2k3(cid:17)k=0,...,d

the constraints (5556) under the form

i1...ip2k2 = 

1

p  2k  2

therefore, we can redene the constraints (6566) like

i1...ip2k2  0, k = 0, . . . , c,

t (1)
i1...ip2k3  i1...ip2k3  (1)

i1...ip2k3  0, k = 0, . . . , d.

(73)

it is clear that the constraints (5556), (6061), (6768) and (7273) are
rst-class and irreducible. the number of physical degrees of freedom of the
last irreducible model coincides with that of the starting reducible theory.
the rst-class hamiltonian corresponding to the theory possessing the above
mentioned irreducible rst-class constraints can be chosen of the type

in conclusion, starting from action (1) we derived an irreducible theory based
on the rst-class constraints (5556), (6061), (6768), (7273) and on the
rst-class hamiltonian (74). we remark that the above rst-class constraints
and rst-class hamiltonian density are local functions.

2.3 irreducible brst symmetry

here we point out the construction of the irreducible brst symmetry for
the irreducible theory built previously. the minimal antighost spectrum of
the irreducible koszul-tate dierential is organized as

(cid:16)p1i1ip2k1, p2i1ip2k1(cid:17) , k = 0, . . . , a,

(associated with (60), respectively, (55)),

(cid:16)p1i1ip2k2, p2i1ip2k2(cid:17) , k = 0, . . . , c,

(associated with (72), respectively, (67)),

(cid:16)p1i1...ip2k2, p2i1...ip2k2(cid:17) , k = 0, . . . , c,

15

(75)

(76)

(77)

(corresponding to (61) and (56)), plus

(cid:16)p1i1...ip2k3, p2i1...ip2k3(cid:17) , k = 0, . . . , d,

(78)

(corresponding to (73) and (68)). all the previous elds are fermionic, with
the ps and p s of antighost number one. the usual denitions of  are given
by

za = 0,

pi1ip2k1 = ()

i1ip2k1,  = 1, 2, k = 0, . . . , a,

pi1ip2k2 = ()

i1ip2k2,  = 1, 2, k = 0, . . . , c,

pi1...ip2k2 = t ()

i1ip2k2,  = 1, 2, k = 0, . . . , c,

pi1...ip2k3 = t ()

i1ip2k3,  = 1, 2, k = 0, . . . , d,

(79)

(80)

(82)

(83)

where za generically denotes any original eld/momentum or new variable
in (54), (58) or (6364). with the help of these denitions,  is found nilpo-
tent and acyclic. the other dierential involved with the brst symmetry,
namely, the longitudinal derivative along the gauge orbits, requires the min-
imal ghost spectrum

where f is any function involving the original or newly added bosonic canoni-
cal pairs, and g denote the minimal ghosts (8487). the operator  is in this
case strongly nilpotent. extending  to the antighosts (7578), generically
denoted by p, through

and  to the ghosts (8487) by means of

p = 0,

g = 0,

(90)

(91)

the homological perturbation theory [14] ensures that the irreducible brst
symmetry si =  +  exists and is nilpotent, s2
in conclusion, at
this stage we constructed an irreducible brst symmetry corresponding to
the original reducible one. in the following we nd its relationship with the
standard reducible hamiltonian brst symmetry of the starting model.

i = 0.

2.4 physical observables

here, we establish the link between the reducible and irreducible brst sym-
metries. in this light, we prove that the physical observables corresponding
to the reducible, respectively, irreducible models coincide. we indicate below
the line for p even, the other situation being investigated in a similar way.
initially, we show that any observable associated with the irreducible theory
is also an observable of the reducible system. let f be an observable of the
irreducible model. then, it fulls the equations

hf, (1)

i1...ip2k1i  0, k = 0,    , a, hf, t (1)

i1...ip2k2i  0, k = 0,    , c

i1...ip2k3i  0, k = 0,    , d.

(94)

(95)

(96)

equations (92) imply that f does not depend (at least weakly) on any
a0i1...ip2k1 or h 0i1...ip2k2, while (9596) ensure that f does not involve
(at least weakly) any of the elds b(1)j1...jp2k2, b(2)j1...jp2k2, v (1)j1...jp2k3
or v (2)j1...jp2k3. next, we explore the relations (9394). we start from the
last equations in (9394) assuming that p is even

 2j

y [f (x) , ji (y)] + m [f (x) , i (y)]  y

i [f (x) ,  (y)]  0,

 j

y [f (x) , j (y)]  m [f (x) ,  (y)]  0.

(97)

(98)

applying i

y on (97), multiplying (98) by m and adding the resulting equa-

tions, we arrive at (cid:16)y

j j

y + m 2(cid:17) [f (x) ,  (y)]  0, which yields

[f (x) ,  (y)]  0.

replacing (99) back in (9798), these equations turn into

 2j

y [f (x) , ji (y)] + m [f (x) , i (y)]  0,

taking into account the next equation from (94)

 j

y [f (x) , j (y)]  0.

y [f (x) , lij (y)]  m [f (x) , ij (y)] 

3l

(99)

(100)

(101)

(102)

i [f (x) , j (y)]  y

2 (cid:16)y
y and employing (100101), we get(cid:16)y

j [f (x) , i (y)](cid:17)  0,

i i

y + m 2(cid:17) [f (x) , j (y)] 

multiplied by i
0, hence

substituting the result (103) in (100) and (102), it follows

[f (x) , j (y)]  0.

 2j

y [f (x) , ji (y)]  0,

18

(103)

(104)

 3l

y [f (x) , lij (y)]  m [f (x) , ij (y)]  0.

(105)

writing down the next equation from (93)

4l

y [f (x) , lijk (y)]  m [f (x) , ijk (y)]

3

y
i [f (x) , jk (y)] 

(106)

on which we apply i

y, and subsequently making use of (104105), we nally

deduce that (cid:16)y

i i

y + m 2(cid:17) [f (x) , jk (y)]  0, which then implies

[f (x) , jk (y)]  0.

(107)

inserting the previous result in (105106) and going on with the procedure
described above, we obtain

hf (x) , i1ip2ki  0, k = 1,    , b,
hf (x) , i1ip2k1i  0, k = 1,    , a,

which, replaced in the rst equations from (9394) (corresponding to k = 0),
lead to

(108)

(109)

(110)

(111)

(112)

in (108) we employed the notation

hf, g(2)
hf, g(2)

i1ip1i  0,
i1ip2i  0.

b = ( p

2 , for p even,
p1
2 , for p odd.

the equations (108109) show that f does not depend, at least weakly, on
the elds ai1ip2k and h i1ip2k1, with k  1. as a consequence of our
analysis, we managed to show that an observable f of the irreducible model
does not depend (at least weakly) on the elds (a0i1...ip2k1, h 0i1...ip2k2)k1
(see (92) with k  1), (ai1ip2k, h i1ip2k1)k1 (see (108109)), as well as on
(cid:16)b(1)j1...jp2k2, b(2)j1...jp2k2(cid:17)k0
(see (95

, (cid:16)v (1)j1...jp2k3, v (2)j1...jp2k3(cid:17)k0

96)) and, in addition, it satises the equations

hf, (1)

i1...ip1i  0, hf, t (1)

i1...ip2i  0,

19

(113)

(see (92) with k = 0) and (110111), which are nothing but the equations
veried by an observable of the redundant theory. thus, we can conclude
that any observable corresponding to the irreducible system stands for an
observable of the original reducible model. the converse also holds, namely
any observable of the redundant system remains so for the irreducible theory.
this is because an observable f of the original system checks the equations
(110111), (113) and does not depend on the newly introduced canonical
pairs, such that (92-96) are automatically veried. in consequence, the two
theories (reducible and irreducible) possess the same observables, such that
the zeroth order cohomological groups of sr and si coincide

h 0 (sr) = h 0 (si) .

(114)

thus, the irreducible and reducible theories are equivalent from the brst
formalism point of view, i.e., from the point of view of the basic equations
underlying the brst symmetry, s2 = 0 and h 0 (s) = {physical observables}.
this consideration yields the conclusion that we can replace the brst quan-
tization of the reducible model by that of the irreducible theory.

2.5 irreducible path integral

based on the last conclusion, we approach the hamiltonian brst quantiza-
tion of the irreducible theory. the minimal antighost and ghost spectra are
given in (7578), respectively, (8487). in addition, we further introduce the
non-minimal sector

dierence between the pure ghost number and the antighost number. the

in conclusion, we succeeded in deriving a gauge-xed action with no residual
gauge invariances without introducing the ghosts for ghosts, which moreover,
is lorentz covariant.

3 interacting theories with stueckelberg cou-

pling

the treatment from section 2 starts from the lagrangian action (1), which is
a quadratic action. in this section we study the possibility to perform an irre-
ducible analysis in connection with interacting theories displaying stueckel-
berg coupling. more precisely, we investigate what happens to our irreducible
approach if we add to (1) some interaction terms which are invariant under
the gauge transformations (23). an idea would be to realize the canonical
analysis of the interacting theory and to further apply the irreducible treat-
ment developed in the above. however, the interaction terms may contain
higher order derivatives of the elds, such that the canonical analysis becomes
intricate. in this context, it appears the question whether there exists a more
direct irreducible method for interacting theories. as it will be seen in the
sequel, the answer is armative. in this light, we prove that our irreducible
hamiltonian formalism induces an irreducible lagrangian method that sim-
plies the approach to interacting theories. in view of this we investigate the
gauge invariances of the lagrangian action associated with the irreducible
hamiltonian formulation of abelian p- and (p  1)-forms with stueckelberg
coupling. from the point of view of the hamiltonian brst quantization,
the split into primary and secondary constraints is not important. in this
situation, what matters is the hamiltonian gauge algebra. on the contrary,
in order to obtain the gauge transformations of the lagrangian action, it is
necessary to distinguish between the primary and secondary rst-class con-
straints. this is why we work with a model of hamiltonian theory in the
case of stueckelberg coupling for which we assume that (6061) and (72
73) are primary, while (5556) and (6768) are secondary constraints. the
corresponding extended action takes the form

where the u()s and u()s denote the lagrange multipliers of the corre-
sponding constraints. from the extended action (132) we can obtain the
so-called total action by setting all the multipliers of the type u(2) and u(2)
equal to zero. on the other hand, from the gauge transformations of (132) we
can determine those of the total action by also taking the gauge variations of
the u(2)s and u(2)s equal to zero. finally, from the gauge transformations of
the total action we consequently arrive at the lagrangian gauge invariances
by eliminating the momenta and remaining multipliers on their equations
of motion.
in this way, starting from (132) we derive the corresponding
lagrangian gauge transformations

with (i1...ip2k2, i1...ip2k3) corresponding to the constraints (67), respec-
tively, (68), and (i1...ip2k1, i1...ip2k2) associated with (55), respectively,
(56). the elds b(1)1 ...p2k2 and v (1)1...p2k3 are identied with

on their equations of motion, we derive that the lagrangian action resulting
from (132) is identical with the original one, i.e.,

the theory based on action (141) and subject to the irreducible gauge trans-
formations (133136) represents the lagrangian manifestation of the irre-
ducible hamiltonian model constructed in section 2. the crucial feature of
this irreducible lagrangian theory is that it leads to (122123) via the an-
tield brst formalism by using an appropriate gauge-xing fermion. the
minimal solution to the master equation associated with the above irreducible
lagrangian theory is given by

the elds 1...p2k1, c 1...p2k2, b1...p2k1 and b1...p2k2 together with
the attached antields, which carry a star superscript, form the lagrangian
non-minimal sector. hence, until now we proved that the irreducible la-
grangian version for the quadratic theory leads to the same path integral like
the hamiltonian one. based on this result, we can simply solve the interacting
case. if we add to action (1) any interaction terms that are gauge invariant
under (23), the starting point of the irreducible approach is expressed by
the interacting action, which is invariant under the gauge transformations
(133136). in this situation the non-minimal solution of the master equa-
tion can be obtained from (143) by adding the starting interaction terms.
using the same gauge-xing fermion, namely, (144), we reach a gauge-xed
action that coincides with (123) apart from the starting lagrangian action,
which must include the gauge-invariant interaction pieces. this solves the
interacting case discussed here.

4 conclusion

to conclude with, in this paper we presented an irreducible brst approach
to interacting p-form gauge theories with stueckelberg coupling. our pro-
cedure includes two basic steps. the rst one is relying on the irreducible

27

hamiltonian analysis of the quadratic action describing stueckelberg cou-
pled p- and (p  1)-forms. the irreducible treatment is mainly based on
some irreducible rst-class constraints associated with the original reducible
ones. the derivation of the irreducible constraint set is realized by requiring
that all the antighost number one co-cycles of the koszul-tate dierential
identically vanish under an appropriate redenition of the antighost number
one antighosts, and, in the meantime, that the number of physical degrees
of freedom should remain unchanged by passing to the irreducible context.
the approach to interacting theories with stueckelberg coupling is strongly
related to the irreducible method developed for the quadratic action. thus,
beginning with the hamiltonian gauge transformations generated by the ir-
reducible rst-class constraints we derive their lagrangian version, which, in
turn, is a good starting point for an irreducible brst approach to interacting
theories with stueckelberg coupling.
