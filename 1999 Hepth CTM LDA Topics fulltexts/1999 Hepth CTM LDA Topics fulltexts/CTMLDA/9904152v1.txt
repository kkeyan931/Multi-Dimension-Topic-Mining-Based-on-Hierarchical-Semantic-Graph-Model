abstract

the regularization ambiguity manifest in the fermionic determinant of the chiral
schwinger model (qed2) is studied and the restriction imposed by the interfer-
ence is computed. the classication of the regularization ambiguity in three dier-
ent classes according to the number of second-class constraints, including the new
faddeevian regularization, is examined and extended. this new class with three
constraints is found to possess a free continuous one parameter family of elements.
unitarity restricts the parameter range in a way similar to the two-constraints class
found earlier by jackiw and rajaraman. the interference eects between right and
left movers, producing the massive vectorial photon, are shown to constrain the
regularization parameter to belong to the four-constraints class which is the only
non-ambiguous class with a unique regularization parameter.

1. this paper is devoted to analyze and explore the restrictions that the soldering mech-
anism [1, 2, 3, 4] imposes over the regularization ambiguity of 2d chiral fermionic de-
terminants. the soldering technique that is dimensionally independent and designed to
work with dual manifestations of some symmetry is well suited to deal with the chiral
character of 2d anomalous gauge theories. recently [5] a new interpretation for the
phenomenon of dynamical mass generation known as schwinger mechanism[6], has been
proposed which explores the ability of the soldering formalism to embrace interference
eects. in that study the interference of right and left gauged floreanini-jackiw chiral
bosons [7] was shown to lead to a massive vectorial mode, for the special case where the
jackiw-rajaraman (jr) regularization parameter is a = 1 [8][9].

after the discovery that the qed2 could be consistently quantized if the regular-
ization ambiguity were properly taken into account, the investigation on this subject has
received considerable attention and emphasis [10][11]. the quantization of the model was
considered from dierent points of view, both canonical and functional and the spectrum
and unitarity was analyzed by distinct techniques, including the gauge invariant wess-
zumino formulation[12], with results consistent with that of ref.[8]. despite this spate of
interest, a surprising new result was reported recently by mitra [13] showing that a dier-
ent regularization prescription was yet possible, leading to new consequences. he proposed
a new (faddeevian) regularization class, materialized by a unique and conveniently chosen
mass term leading to a canonical description with three constraints. recall that in [8] and
[9], the hamiltonian framework was structured in terms of two classes with two and four
second-class constraints respectively. mitras work brings a clear interpretation about the
reason leading the bosonization ambiguity to t into 3 distinct classes, classied according
to the number of constraints present in the model.

it is the main goal of this paper to study the restrictions posed by the soldering
formalism over this new regularization class. an extention of the ambit of ref.[13] to a
one parameter class of solutions is needed to this purpose and is developed in section 2.
the mass of the scalar eld is computed and its dependence on the ambiguity parameter is
shown to be tantamount to that in ref.[8]; the massless sector however is more constrained
than its counterpart in [8], corroborating the results of [13]. the restrictions imposed by
the soldering are worked out in section 3. we nd the striking result that the interference
eects lift the parameter dependence by discriminating the value of the only class which is
non ambiguous. our results substantiate the ndings of [5] that interprets the schwinger
mechanism as a left-right interference phenomenon.

2. in their seminal work jr [8] showed that the qed2 could be consistently quan-
tized by including the bosonization ambiguity parameter satisfying the condition a  1 to
avoid tachyonic excitations. later on, working out the canonical structure of the model,
rajaraman[9] showed that the cases a > 1 and a = 1 belonged to distinct classes: the
a = 1 case represents the four-constraints class, while the a > 1 class presents only two
constraints. the latter is a continuous one-parameter class, while the former class is
non ambiguous containing only one representative. the consequences of these constraint
structures are that the a > 1 class presents, besides the massless excitation also a mas-

2

sive scalar excitation (m2 = e2a2
a1 ) that is not found on the other case. in the canonical
approach the commutator between the primary and the secondary constraints vanishes
in the rst case. the emergence of two more constraints completes the second-class set.
mitra found the amazing fact that with an appropriated choice of the regularization mass
term it is possible to close the second-class algebra with only three constraints. his model
is not manifestly lorentz invariant, but the poincare generators have been constructed
[13] and shown to close the relativistic algebra on-shell. the main feature of this new
regularization is the presence of a schwinger term in the poisson bracket algebra of the
gauss law, which limits the set to only three second-class constraints. to see this let
us write the csm lagrangian, with faddeevian regularization but with mitras regulator
properly generalized to meet our purposes,

l =

(1)

where f = a   a; g = diag(+1, 1) and 01 = 10 = 10 = 1. b is a chirality
parameter, which can assume the values b = 1. the mass-term matrix m is dened
as

m  = (cid:18) 1 
 (cid:19) .

(2)

notice that we have chosen unity coecient for a2
0 term. in a sense, this choice resembles
rajaramans a = 1 class and is the trademark of the faddeevian regularization. rajara-
manss class is a singular point in the space of parameters. its canonical description
has the maximum number of constraints with no massive excitation. such a case is found
in (1) if we make  = 0 in (2). the appearance of a new class needs a non vanishing
value for . with mitras choice,  = 1 and  = 3, the photon becomes massive
(m2 = 4 q2), but the remaining massless fermion has a denite chirality, opposite to that
entering the interaction with the electromagnetic eld. this choice is, however, too re-
strictive and may be relaxed leading to a new and interesting consequences. in this work
the coecients  and  are in principle arbitrary, but the mass spectrum will impose a
constraint between them. this is best seen in the hamiltonian formalism.

the canonical hamiltonian is readily computed

which relates  and  and shows that the regularization ambiguity adopted in [13] can
be extended to a continuous one-parameter class (for a chosen chirality). we have, using
(9) and (10), the following mass formula for the massive excitation of the spectrum,

m2 = q2 1 + b 

b 

.

(11)

note that to avoid tachyonic excitations,  is further restricted to satisfy b  = ||, so
   interchanges from one chirality to another. observe that in the limit   0 the
massive excitation becomes innitely heavy and decouples from the spectrum. this leads
us back to the four-constraints class. it is interesting to see that the redenition of the
parameter as a = 1 + || leads to,

m2 =

q2a2
a  1

(12)

which is the celebrate mass formula of the chiral schwinger model, showing that the
parameter dependence of the mass spectrum is tantamount to both the jackiw-rajaraman
and the faddeevian regularizations.

let us next discuss the massless sector of the spectrum. to disclose the presence of
the chiral excitation we need to diagonalize the reduced hamiltonian (7). this procedure
may, at least in principle, impose further restrictions over . this all boils down to nd
the correct linear combination of the elds leading to the free chiral equation of motion.
to this end we substitute 1 from its denition and a1 from the klein-gordon equation
into equation (8) to obtain

this eld redenition, dierently from the case of the massive eld whose construction
imposed condition (10), does not restrain the parameter  any further. using (4) and
(14), all the elds can be expressed as functions of the free massive scalar a1 and the
free chiral boson , interpreted as the bosonized weyl fermion. the main result of this
section is now complete, i.e., the construction of the one-parameter class regularization
generalizing mitras proposal. the stage is now set to study the interference of chiral
actions with (one-parameter) faddeevian regularization.

3.

in this section we use the soldering formalism introduced in [1] to examine the
restriction imposed by chiral interference over the regularization ambiguity parameter
when the faddeevian approach is adopted. a similar study has taken place recently[5], in
the framework of the usual jr regularization, establishing a strong restriction over the
parameters values and giving rise to a new interpretation for the mechanism of dynamical
mass generation occurring in the schwinger model. this study is meaningful and necessary
since a new class of theories with three second-class constraints has emerged. therefore
it must be veried if new solutions resulting from interference will also lead to a gauge
invariant massive excitation. to begin with, let us rewrite explicitly the two chiral actions
presented in (1) in the appropriate light-cone variables,

l+ = +  +

(a+  +a)2 + 2 q + a  2 q2 | | a2

+ +

+ q2 (1 + | |) aa+ ,

(16)

(17)

where we have used the convention l = l|b. for clarity, we have used dierent elds
(, ) for opposite chiralities and the corresponding mass-term parameters (, ) to make
clear that these chiral theories are uncorrelated. however by making use of soldering
formalism we will get a meaningful combination of these components.

the main point of soldering is to lift the global nother symmetry of each chiral com-
ponent to a local symmetry of the system as a whole. showing only the main parts of the
soldering formalism we can see that the axial transformation ( =  = ) leads to

l+ = + j()
l =  j+()

(18)

where j() = 2( + qa) and j+() = 2(+ + qa+) are the noethers currents and
 is the gauge parameter. next we introduce the soldering eld b appropriately coupled
to the noether currents to obtain the once iterated chiral actions as,

6

l(0)
l(0)

+  l(1)
  l(1)

+ = l(0)
 = l(0)

+ + b+ j()
 + b j+() .

(19)

the soldering elds act as partial compensators for the variance (18), transforming vec-
torially under the axial symmetry, b = . it is now possible to dene an eective
lagrangian invariant under the combined transformation of the chiral elds and compen-
sators as,

lef f = l1

+ + l1

 + 2 b+ b .

(20)

the soldered action is obtained using the fact that b are auxiliary elds. their elimi-
nation may be done altogether from their eld equations but the eects of soldering will
persist as a residual symmetry for the remaining elds. this will naturally cohere the
otherwise independent chiral elds  and  in the form of a soldered lagrangian for a
collective eld  as,

lef f = +     2 q (a+    a + ) +

+

q2

2 h a2

+   a2

  (  ) a+ ai

2

(+a  a+)2

(21)

where  =   . notice that except for the last term, the soldered action describes
the massive gauge invariant bosonised version of the schwinger model, with the gauge
invariant collective eld  playing the role the of the photon eld. gauge invariance
imposes a strong constraint over the parameters as,

 =  = 0.

(22)

this value corresponds to the a = 1, four-constraints regularization class. this is a
remarkable result, consistent with [5].

a notable feature of the present analysis is the disclosure of a new class of parameter-
izations and their dependence with the number of constraints. dierent aspects of this
feature were elaborated and the consequences of interference computed. to discuss further
the implications of interference on chiral actions it is best to compare with the existing
literature. this also serves to put the present work in a proper perspective. to be precise,
it was initialy shown that in the faddeevian approach there are actually three second-class
constraints with a real parameter dependence. to disclose this one-parameter dependence
of the faddeevian regularization is a new interesting result. the counting of constraints
explains the presence of only one chiral excitation in the spectrum (besides the massive
mode). this is in contrast with the usual jr regularization where the massless excitation
is scalar, and is essentially tied to the fact that this regularization is less constrained.

the restrictions of soldering however conne the appearance of a massive vector excita-
tion to the interference of modes belonging to the a = 1 class that, being more constrained,

7

has only a massless scalar in the spectrum. this might raise questions about the inter-
ference of the chiral modes in this class. it should be noticed however that the use of
light-cone variables in the soldering constrains even further these chiral actions. both the
two and the four-constraints classes display chiral excitations instead of massless scalars.
the original chiral mode of the mitras class therefore disappear in the presence of the
extra light-cone constraint and there appears to exist an ambiguity challenging the real
meaning of the soldering. in fact there are no massless particles in the spectrum of (16-17)
for the light-cone setting. however, what is important to observe in this scenario is that
the whole process of soldering is done in the lagrangian framework, such that the limit
a  1 is well dened. this is also valid for the jr regularization. the limit leads to
the a = 1 action and the canonical analysis may be done unambiguously. oppositely, the
hamiltonian formulation has the a = 1 point as a singularity, as shown in (6).

4.

in this work we studied the bosonized form of the csm fermionic determinant
adopting the three-constraints regularization parameterized by a single real number. this
extends early regularizations proposed by jr and mitra. our results display a clear-
cut separation of the existing classes shown to depend only on the number of second-
class constraints. the new class with faddeevian regularization and three second-class
constraints has been worked out in great detail. the spectrum has been shown to consist
of a chiral boson and a massive photon eld. the mass formula for the scalar excitation
was shown to reproduce the jr result. considerations of unitarity therefore restrain
the range of the regularization parameter similarly. the use of the soldering formalism
supplemented by gauge invariance restricts the otherwise arbitrary ambiguity parameter
to the specic value a = 1, which corresponds to the four-constraints class. this new
result discriminates the special character of this unambiguous regularization point and
reinforces the ndings of [5] that interprets the schwinger dynamical mass generation
mechanism as a consequence of right and left interference.
