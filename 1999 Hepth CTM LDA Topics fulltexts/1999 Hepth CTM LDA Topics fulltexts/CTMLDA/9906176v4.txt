abstract

conformally invariant sigma models in d = 2n dimensions with target non-compact
it is shown that despite the non-compact nature of the
o(2n, 1) groups are studied.
o(2n, 1) groups, the classical action and hamiltonian are positive denite.
instanton
eld congurations are found to correspond geometrically to conformal stereographic
mappings of r2n into the euclidean signature ads2n spaces. zaikovs relationship between
self dual p-branes and chern-simons p-branes, provided p = p + 1 and the embedding
d = p + 1-dimensional manifold is euclidean , is elaborated further. branes actions can be
obtained also from a moyal deformation quantization of generalized yang mills theories.
using this procedure, we show how four dimensional su (n ) ym theories contain chern-
simons membranes and hadronic bags in the large n limit. since chern-simons p-branes
have an underlying innite dimensional algebra containing w1+ , as shown by zaikov,
we discuss the importance that w geometry should have in the nal formulation of m
theory.

i. introduction

conformally invariant o(2n+1)  models in 2n dimensions were of crucial importance
in the construction of conformally invariant lagrangians, with vanishing world-volume
cosmological constant, for bosonic p-branes ( p + 1 = 2n ) [1,2]. in particular, self dual
unit charge instanton solutions were found which correspond to conformal ( stereographic)
maps from r2n  s2n. these models [1] were the higher-dimensional extension of the
o(5)  models of feisager and leinaas in 4d [3]. when p + 1 = odd, the authors [2] also
built lagrangians for bosonic extendons ( branes) , however, conformal invariance was
lost. these sort of lagrangians allowed the author to construct a polynomial action for
the spinning membrane after a weyl covariantization process was performed [4]. another
weyl invariant spinning membrane action was constructd by [5] but it was nonpolynomial
complicating the quantization program.
conformal field theories have risen to more prominence recently mainly due to mal-
dacenas conjecture on the ads/cft duality between m/string theory on adsd  sdd
backgrounds and cfts living on the projective boundary of the adsd spaces [6]. rele-
vant  models with target spaces on certain supergroups have been used to decribe cf t
on ads backgrounds with ramond-ramond (rr) flux [7]. in particular, various exact
2d cf t on ads2n+1 backgrounds have been constructed recently that could be used in
building superstring theories propagating on ads2n+1 backgrounds [8]. these  models

1

were based on the standard sl(2, r) wznw model; i.e  models on group manifolds with
wznw terms.

conventional -models are based on compact groups like o(2n), su (n)....

in gen-
eral, compact simple groups are used mainly to simplify the quantization program; i.e the
quantization is not riddled with the standard problems of ghosts due to the non-positive
denite inner products; uniqueness of the wz functional; solvability of the model; positiv-
ity of the hamiltonian [29,30]. the authors [29] studied o(n, 1), su (n, 1) non-compact
sigma models in two-dimensions and have shown that a dynamical mass generation with
asymptotic freedom is possible and that a sensible unitary quantization program is possible
by recurring to a selection rule in the hilbert space of states ( only postive denite norms
are allowed).

setting aside these technical subtleties on the compact simple character of the group,
and motivated by the recent ndings on anti de sitter spaces, we will study conformally
invariant ( noncompact ) o(2n1, 2) -models in 2n even dimensions; i.e maps from r2n to
o(2n 1, 2) and o(2n, 1). instanton solutions are found for the latter case, corresponding
to conformal, stereographic  maps from r2n to o(2n, 1). the so(2n, 1) group mani-
fold, modulo the action of its maximal compact subgroup so(2n), so(2n, 1)/so(2n), is
topologically the euclidean signature ads2n whose natural isometry group is so(2n, 1).
to be more specic, we shall concentrate on o(2n  1, 2) and o(2n, 1) -models keeping
in mind that the relevant groups are the so(2n  1, 2) and so(2n, 1).
the lorentz signature ads2n space can be viewed as a hyperboloid embedded in a
pseudo-euclidean 2n + 1-dim manifold with coordinates ya = y0, y1, ..., y2n and diagonal
metric given by ab = diag (, +, +, .., +, ) with length squared yaya preserved by the
isometry group so(2n  1, 2). the ads2n is dened as the geometrical locus :

yaybab = r2 = 1.
de sitter spaces require a change in the sign in the r.h.s.

(1)

signature subtleties are crucial in the construction of instanton solutions. the ordi-
nary hodge dual star operation is signature dependent. for example, the double hodge
dual star operation acting on a rank p dierential form in a 4d space satises :

f = s(1)p(4p)f. s = +1 f or (4, 0); (2, 2). s = 1 f or (3, 1); (1, 3)

(2)

where we have displayed the explicit signature dependence in the values of s. hence, for a
rank two form f , in euclidean 4d space and with signature (2, 2) ( atiyah-ward spaces)
one can nd solutions to the (anti) self dual ym equations : f = f . there are no
ym instantons in 4d minkowski space since in the latter one has imaginary eigenvalues :
f = if .
the two temporal variables are required in the embedding process of ads2n into the
pseudo-euclidean space r2n1,2 we will show, in fact, that it is the noncompact o(2n, 1) -
model, instead of the o(2n 1, 2) -model , that has instanton solutions obeying a double
self duality condition similar to the one obeyed by the bpst instanton [9]. it was shown [1]
that , the euclidean ( compact) o(2n + 1)  model instanton solutions are directly related
to instanton solutions of o(2n) generalized ym (gym) theories in r2n [10] obeying the
forementioned double self duality condition.

2

in view of the conformally invariant  models/gym connection in higher dimensions,
the next step is to study p-branes ( with p + 1 = 2n ) propagating on adsd backgrounds.
in particular, the critical case when the dimensionality of the target space is saturated
, d = p + 1 = 2n. dolan-tchrakian [1,2] constructed the corresponding conformally
invariant skyrme-like actions, with vanishing world-volume cosmological constant , based
on these conformally invariant  models in 2n-dimensions. upon the algebraic elimination
of the auxiliary world-volume metric, dolan and tchrakian have shown that one recovers
the dirac-nambu-goto action :

s = t z d2n q|det g|. g, =  x x .

(3)

where g is the induced world-volume metric resulting from the embedding of the p +
1 = 2n hypervolume into the d-dim target spacetime. when the spacetime dimension is
saturated : d = p + 1 = 2n the square root of the dirac-nambu-goto action simplies
and one obtains the usual jacobian for the change of variables from  to x. in such case
the nambu-goto action is topological : there are no physical local transverse degrees of
freedom . such topological actions have been studied by zaikov [11]. for a review of
membranes and other p  branes with extensive references see [12]. the action is then :

s = t z d2n 1x 1  .......  2nx 2n .

(4)

where t is the p-brane ( extendon) tension. for a p-brane whose world-volume has a
natural boundary , an integration ( gauss law) yields :

s = t zv

d2n1 x 1   1 x 2  .......   2n1x 2n .

(5)

one then recovers the action for the chern-simons p brane whose p + 1 world-volume
variables ,  a, a = 1, 2, .....p + 1, are integrated over the 2n  1-dim boundary v of the
2n-dim domain v associated with the world volume of the open p-brane. the value of p
must be such that p + 1 = p = 2n 1 [11]. zaikov concluded that these topological chern
simons p-branes exit only in target spacetimes of dimensionality d = p + 2.
in particular, when the dimensionality of the target spacetime is saturated , d =
p + 1, one can construct, in addition , self-dual p-brane (extendon) solutions obeying the
equations of motion and constraints ( resulting from p + 1 reparametrization invariance of
the world-volume) that are directly related to these topological chern-simons p-branes.
this holds provided p +1 = p and the embedding manifold is euclidean [12]. furthermore,
when d = p+1 = 2n one has conformal invariance a well [1,2]. it is in this fashion how the
relationship between the self dual p-branes and chern simons p = p  1 branes emerges .
this is roughly the analogy with wittens discovery of the one-to-one relationship between
3d nonabelian chern-simons theories and 2d rational cft. [13].

the topological chern-simons action (5) and the action (4) , obtained by using gauss

law , are among the main ones considered in this work.

in section ii we will show that the euclidean signature ads2n signature is an instan-
ton solution of the o(2n, 1) -models. in 3.1 we discuss the relation between ( open ) self

3

dual p-branes and chern-simons p-branes for p = p + 1. in 3.2 we show that ( space-
time lling ) p-branes can be obtained from a moyal deformation quantization ( of the lie
algebraic structure ) of generalized yang mills theories [1] ( gym). adding a topological
term makes these theories nontrivial due to boundary dynamics. in particular, we briey
review [35] how chern-simons membranes and hadronic bags emerge from the large n
limit of quenched, reduced 4d su (n ) ym (qcd ) [36] . in 3.3 w geometry is discussed
in connection to these theories. finally we present our conclusions.

ii euclidean ads2n as o(2n, 1) -model instantons

as a prototype we will imagine a chern-simons membrane living on the euclideanized
ads4 background , which in turn, will be shown to be the instanton eld conguration of
the conformally invariant o(4, 1)  model in r4 obeying the double self-duality condition
to be described below by eq-(8b).

since the conformally invariant euclidean o(5)-model in r4 has a correspondence
with the conformally invariant o(4) ym in r4 [1] it is natural to ask whether the analytical
continuation from o(4, 1)  o(5) will allow to establish the following relationships in four-
dimensions among : topological chern-simons membrane living in ( euclidean) ads4;
instanton congurations of the conformally invariant o(4, 1) -models in r4 and o(4)
yang-mills instantons ( obeying a double self duality condition described below by eq-
(8a)) in r4.

the importance to establish this web of relationships is because one may generalize
this web to higher dimensions with the provision that d = 2n = 4k. for example, in
d = 12 we may have the connections among the chern-simons p = 10-brane moving on
the euclideanized ads12; instantons of the conformally invariant o(12, 1) -models in r12
and o(12) generalized yang-mills (gym) theories in r12 . when the group is compact
like o(2n) , for example, the latter gym are dened by lagrangians [1,10] in rd where
d = 2n = 4k :

l = tr (f 12....2k

1,2....2k 1,2.....2k)2 = (f2  f2....  f2)2. 2n = 4k = d

(6)

with all indices antisymmetrized. 12... is the totally antisymmetrized product ( on
the internal indices ) of the product of k factors of the 22k1  22k1 matrices 12
corresponding to the chiral representation of so(4k).
the exhibiting relationship between the instanton eld congurations of the o(5) 
model and the o(4) ym system in r4 were given by [1] . the order parameter eld of
the o(5)  model is the o(5) vector ni(x) obeying the constraint :ni(x)ni(x) = 1 . the
denition of the gauge elds and eld strengths for the ym system in terms of the ni(x)
are :

aij
 = ni(x)nj(x)  nj(x)ni(x).

f ij
 (x) = aij

(7a)

(7b)

  aik

 alj

 kl     = [n[i]nj].

due to the constraint nini = 1 the former eld stength coincides with the denition given
below by eq-(8c). when nini = 1 one should have +aik
 in the denition (7b) instead;

 alj

4

i.e. a change in sign in the coupling constant. these signs subtleties are essential otherwise
the eld strength will be zero.

an additional constraint allows to reduce o(5)  o(4) :

(i

j + aij

 )ni(x) = 0

(7c)

after using eqs-(7a,7b,7c) the authors [1] have shown that o(4) ym instanton solu-

tions obey a double self duality condition satised by the bpst instanton [9] : :

1212 f 12

12 = 1212 f 12

(8d)

the unit charge instanton solutions of eq-(8b) that minimize the action (8c) and
correspond to the o(4) ym instanton solutions of eq-(8a) were found to be precisely the
ones corresponding to the stereographic projections ( conformal mappings) from r4  s4
[1] :

na(x) =

a=4

(na)2 + (n5)2 = 1.

(9)

things dier now for the (noncompact )o(2n, 1) -models due to the subtle signature
changes. now we must see whether or not the o(2n, 1) vector ni(x) with i = 1, 2, ......2n+1
satisfy the double self duality condition

the stereographic maps from r4 to the euclidean signature ads4 dened by :

(11c)

which is just the o(4, 1) invariant norm of the vector ni(x) = (n1(x), .....n5(x)) and satisfy
the double-self duality condition conditions (8b) as we shall show in this section . it is
important to emphasize that the double self duality conditions are not derived from the
actions (8c, 8d). however, solutions to the double self duality conditions automatically
obey the equations of motion, due to the analog of the bianchi identities, like it occurs in
ordinary ym theories. but the converse is not true.

another important issue we shall address now is the issue of singularities. the solu-
tions given by eqs-(11) obey the double self duality conditions and are naturally singular
at the points x2 = 1. these points have a correspondence with the projective/conformal
boundaries at innity as we will show at the end of this section. nevertheless, eqs-(8a, 8b)
are still satised and no singularities occur in the denition of the norm. these singularities
are naturally due to the noncompact nature of ads spaces.

the most famous example is the ads metric : the ads conformally at metric is
singular at the points x2 = 1 as well. the scalar curvature is well dened and equals
the negative cosmological constant r =  as it should. however, the einstein-hilbert
action associated with the ads metric blows up due to the divergent contributions of the
determinant of the metric; i.e the measure of integration diverges at x2 = 1 :

g =

1

(1  x2)2   z d2nxgr = z d2nxg = z d2nx

1

(1  x2)2n .

(12)

using the standard power counting arguments one can show that the integral diverges due
to the pole at x2 = 1. the fact that the action diverges is not a reason to abandon the
ads metric solutions to the equations r = . by the same token, despite the singularities
of the instanton eld congurations due to the non-compact nature of o(2n, 1), one should
not disregard them as being irrelevant nor pathological.

a similar reasoning can be applied to the schwarzschild solution that has a true
physical singularity at the origin r = 0. and also to the poincare metric associated with
the projective disk model in the complex plane. the latter is singular at the boundary of
the disc which can be holomorphically be mapped to the real axis of the complex plane.

these singular eld congurations have  zero measure  contribution in the euclidean
path integral since they are exponentially supressed ese  0. at the classical level, one
can regularize their singular contributions in the classical action. this is achieved by
adding compensating surface terms to the bulk actions (8c, 8d) and in this fashion one
can cancel out the divergent contributions due to the points x2 = 1. these boundary
terms are the analogs of the  topological terms in ym theories. notice that the actions in
eqs-(8c,8d) have the ym form : f  f . the topological  terms have the form : f  f
where by in our case by the  operation one means the double star operation with respect
to the base manifold indices and target space indices and is given up to factorial numerical
factors by :

[ f 12.....n
i1i2.....in

]  12.....n12......ni1i2.....i2n+1ni2n+1 (x)f in+1in+2....i2n

12.....n

.

(13)

the singular eld congurations (11) are nothing but the solutions to the double self
duality equations , therefore by adding the analog of a theta term ( with the suitable sign
) of the form :  f  f , to the ym-type bulk action f  f , given by eqs-(8c,8d) and
evaluated at the singular eld congurations (11), one will be able to cancel out those
singular contributions to the bulk action due to the behaviour at x2 = 1 ; i.e to the
projective boundaries at innity.

another alternative is to simply introduce a natural  cuto  in dening/restricting
the domain of integration by imposing x2 = 2 < 1 the analog of this procedure is the
selection of the fundamental modular domain of the string one loop ( multiloop ) path
integrals. the siegel upper half complex plane is noncompact with innite area. dividing
by the action of the discrete modular group one ends up by having one single copy of
the fundamental domain which is still noncompact but has a f inite area. an analogous
example of this ( although not identical ) is the action for a point particle. the action
naturally diverges if one takes the interval of proper time from 0 to . the cut-o simply
states to dene the action in the compact domain where the proper time is bounded 0,  .
before we nalize the discussion on the issue of singularities it is very important to
emphasize that the solutions to the double self duality conditions are dened modulo con-
formal transformations of the base space r2n. one could re-absorb the singular behavour
of the instanton solutions at x2 = 1 inside these conformal scaling factors. for example,
the ads metric is singular at x2 = 1 because the conformal factor is precisely singular at
x2 = 1. the ads metric is conformally at and therefore belongs in the same conformal
class as the at metric. under this procedure the conformally re-scaled eld congurations
will be well behaved , however the action (8c, 8d) will still diverge due to the singular
behaviour of the determinant of the new re-scaled metric. this is similar to what occurs
with the einstein-hilbert action associated with the ads metric : the scalar curvature
r =  is nite but the action diverges due to the singularity in the determinant of the
metric at x2 = 1.

after this discussion on adding a compensating boundary term to the actions (8c,
8d) , ...etc....
if one wishes to regularize the divergent contributions due to the natural
singularities at x2 = 1, which correspond to the projective boundaries at innity, we will
proceed to study the signature dependence in the denition of the duality operation. for
the particlar case when 2n = 4, the double duality star operation is dened :

the  acting on f is :

f  1212 i1i2i3i4i5 ni5 f i3i4
12 .

(14)

f = (1)(1)sb(1)sg (1)f f.

(15)
where (i) the rst factor of 1 stems from the nini = 1 condition. (ii) the second factor
stems from the signature of the base space r4. (iii) the third factor stems from the group
signature which is (1)1 = 1 for o(4, 1). (iv) the last one, (1)f , are additional factors
resulting from the permutation of the indices in the 1....2n and i1....i2n+1 tensors . these
are similar to the (1)r(dr) factor appearing in the double hodge operation. where r
represents the rank of f . in this case they yield the factor 1.

7

from (15) one immediately concludes that the signature of the base manifold must

be : (+, +, +, +) so that

f = (1)(1)sb(1)sg f = (1)(+1)(1)(1)f = f  ()2 = 1 = 1.

(16a)

and one has a well dened double (anti) self duality condition.

f = f.

(16b)

for higher rank elds, f i1.....in

1.....n it follows from (15) that we must have in addition
that n = even. therefore we conclude that the base manifold must be of euclidean signa-
ture type and have for dimension: r4k and the target group background o(4k, 1), whose
topology is that of the euclideanized ads4k . thus, the maps are signature-preserving
and the dimensionality of the base manifold must be a multiple of four, d = 4k .

it still remains to prove that the o(4k, 1) -eld na(x) given by eqs-(11) solve the
double self duality condition (10); that they saturate the minimum of the action to ensure
topological stability, if indeed such minima exit, which is not necessary the case. also the
instanton solutions must yield a nite valued action; i.e the elds must fall o suciently
fast at innity so the action does not blow up;....

to satisfy these requirements it is essential to prove rstly that the classical action and
classical hamiltonian are positive denite. a close inspection reveals that one should have
an euclidean signature base manifold which forces one to choose an euclidean signature
ads2n space if the condition (16a) is to be satised. therefore, instead of o(2n  1, 2)
one must have o(2n, 1). to illustrate the fact that the classical action is positive denite
and without loss of generality we study the r4,0  ads4,0 case. ( the euclideanization of
ads4). we must show that :

(f ij

 )2 > 0. i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3.

in d = 4 there are six terms of the form :

g00g11[(f ab

01 )2  (f 5a

01 )2] + g00g22[(f ab

02 )2  (f 5a

02 )2] + .....+

(17)

(18)

g11g22[(f ab

12 )2  (f 5a

12 )2] + .......

due to the euclidean nature of the base manifold the g00g11 > 0 so we must show then
that the terms inside the brackets in eq-(18) are all positive denite. the a, b indices run
over : 1, 2, 3, 4 and the last one is the i = 5 component n5 associated with the non-compact
o(4, 1)-valued ni eld. setting ni = (na, n5)  (~, ) the condition nini = 1 yields :

2 = ~.~ + 1 = 2 + 1.

(19)

which implies for every single component of x;  = 0, 1, 2, 3 ( we are not summing over
the x) :

(n5)2 <

2
2 (~).(~);  = 0, 1, 2, 3.

(20)

8

then :

(f 5a

01 )2 =

1
2 [(0a)(~.1~)  (1a)(~.0~)]2 <

2
2 (0a1b  1a0b)2.

(21)

where we used the relation ( ~a. ~b)2  a2b2. the rst term of (18) yields :

(f ab

01 )2  (f 5a

01 )2 > (1 

2
2 )(0a1b  1a0b)2 > 0.

(22)

because (1  2
2 ) > 0 due to the relation (19). the same argument applies for each single
component of (f ij
 )2 and hence the classical action and hamiltonian are positive denite.
this is an essential ingredient for the instanton solution to saturate the minimum of the
classical action. from ordinary yang-mills in euclidean space and for compact gauge
groups like su (2) we have the familiar relation :

z d4x (f  f )2 = 2z d4x f 2  2z d4x f f  0  z d4x f 2  z d4x f f

(23)

in the self dual case, the last equality holds. the last integral for the su (2) group (
topologically s3) is the winding number s3  s3, a topological invariant; hence the self
dual instanton obeying f = f saturates the lower bound of the positive denite action
and ensures the topological stability. to nalize one must have that the eld strengths fall
o suciently fast at innity to ensure that the action doesnt blow up : rnf i1...in
1....n  0
as r  .
in the non-compact ads case studied here one naturally encounters singularities at
x2 = 1 for the instanton congurations corresponding to the projective boundaries at
innity. the classical action for the o(4, 1) -model in r4 was positive denite and since
the instanton solutions saturate the lower bound of the classical action this implies that
the action diverges. the source of its divergence is naturally due to the noncompact nature
of the o(2n, 1) group. to regularize the action one can add compensating boundary terms
and/or restrict the domain of integration to a compact region inside the 2n-dimensional
disc x2 = 1.

whatever the choices to regularize the action may be this does not change the crux of
this work : the instanton solutions found in eqs-(11) are genuine solutions of the double
self duality conditions (8b,13) which are an integrable subset of the equations of motion for
the conformally invariant -models on ads2n spaces given by the action of eqs-(8c,8d). the
instanton solutions are dened modulo a conformal transformation of the base manifold
r2n.

it remains to prove that the solutions (11) obey the double self duality condition (10).
this former property is a straightforward extension of the results in [1,3] for the compact
case. given the stereographic projections dened by eq-(11) : r2n  h 2n one can nd a
set of independent 2n + 1 frame vectors, ep, representing the pullback of the orthogonal
frame vectors of the 2n + 1-dim pseudo-euclidean manifold onto the euclidean signature
ads2n space :

e1 = x1ni; e2 = x2 ni; .....e2n = x2n ni. e2n+1 = ni. i = 1, 2, .....2n + 1

which precisely yields the euclideanized ads2n metric g dended as the pullback of the
embedding metric, satisfying r  g  and r  . the latter curvature relations are
the hallmark of anti de sitter space ( negative scalar curvature). the positive denite
measure spanned by the collection of 2n + 1 frame vectors denes the natural volume
element of the euclideanized ads2n :

det h = det (e1, e2, ......, e2n, e2n+1).

(26)

it was shown by [1,3] (for the compact case the orthogonality condition is naturally
modied to yield the metric of the s2n) that the orthogonality conditions eqs-(25) are
the necessary and suf f icient conditions to show that the particular eld congurations
ni(x) given by (11), after extending the four dimensional result to any d = 2n, satisfy the
double self duality conditions eq-(10). the orthogonality relation implies that the angles
among any two vectors is preserved and that all vectors af ter the conformal mapping has
been taken have equal length relative to each other ( this does not mean that they have
the same length as before ! ).

this is a signal of a conformal mapping. the stereographic maps are a particular
class of conformal maps. the action of the conformal group in r2n will furnish the re-
maining conformal maps [1,3]. hence, we see here once again the interrelation between
self-duality and conformal invariance.
in two dimensions self-duality implies conformal
invariance ( holomorphicity). in higher dimensions matters are more restricted, they are
not equivalent.

therefore, setting aside the subtleties in the quantization program due to the non-
compact nature of o(2n, 1), we have shown that these o(2n, 1) -model instanton eld
congurations obtained by means of the stereographic ( conformal) maps of r2n  h 2n,
correspond precisely to the coordinates, y1, y2, ....y4, y5 of the 5-dim pseudo-euclidean
manifold onto which the euclidean signature ads4 space is embedded. to illustrate this
lets focus on euclidean signature ads4 dened as the geometrical locus :

y2  (y1)2 + (y2)2 + (y3)2 + (y4)2  (y5)2 = 2 = 1.

(27)

where we set the ads scale  = 1. the ads4 coordinates : z0, z1, z2, z3 are related to
the ya using the stereographic projection ( see the lectures by petersen [6]) from the
south pole of the euclidean signature ads4 to the equator :

ya(z) = 

2z

1  z2 ;  = 0, 1, 2, 3. a = 1, 2, 3, 4. y5(z) = 

1 + z2

1  z2 .

(28)

10

it is straighforward to verify that y2 = 2 = 1. the euclidean signature ads corre-
sponds to two hyperbolic branches. a north and south branch respectively intersecting
the vertical axis at y5 = . the mappings are performed by projecting the rays stem-
ming from the  south pole  s, the vertex of the southern hyperbolic branch located at
y5 = , intersecting the equator r2n ( passing through the origin dividing the north and
south branches ) at point p  . one extends the rays sp  through the equator upwardly
until they intersect the upper hyperbolic branch at point p . it is in this fashion how one
constructs the  stereographic  mappings (28).

the euclidean signature ads4 metric is given :

g =

z2 = (z0)2 + .... + (z3)2.

(29)

(1  z2)2 

as mentioned above, the metric blows up at x2 = 1, points that correspond to the
projective boundaries at innity. as we can verify by inspection, there is an exact match
with the instanton eld congurations ni(x) (11). the metric (29) also matches (25) after
the correspondence : na(x)  y(z) and n5(x)  y5(z) is made.
therefore, the main conclusion of this section is : the instanton eld congurations
of the conformally invariant o(2n, 1) -models, obeying the double self duality conditions
(8b,13 ) correspond geometrically to the conformal  stereographic maps of r2n into the
euclidean signature ads2n spaces.

these conformally invariant o(2n, 1) sigma model actions in r2n are just the sigma
model generalizations of the macdowell-mansouri action for ordinary gravity based on
gauging the conformal group so(4, 2) in d = 4 minkowski space and the anti de sitter
group so(3, 2). the ordinary lorentz spin connection and the tetrad in four dimensions
are just pieces of the so(3, 2) gauge connection. upon setting the torsion to zero one
recovers the 4d einstein-hilbert action with a cosmological constant and the gauss-bonnet
topological term. the conformally invariant sigma models actions [1] are the ones required
in building conformally invariant bosonic p = 2n-brane actions in at or curved target
bcakgrounds. it would be interesting to see what sort of actions can be derived following
the analog of a macdowell-mansouri procedure to obtain einstein gravity from a gauge
theory .

iii.

in this section we shall discuss in detail the connection between self-dual p-branes,
chern-simons p-branes ( for p = p +1) and w geometry. we will also ouline the straight-
forward steps to derive (spacetime-lling) p-branes from moyal deformation quantization
of generalized yang mills theories [1, 34 ] . in particular, we shall show how chern-simons
membranes and hadronic bags emerge from quenched large n qcd . we leave all the
details for the references [34, 35].

3.1 self dual p-branes

as pointed in the introduction, zaikov noticed that self-dual p-branes, when p + 1 =
d = 2n, are related to chern-simons p-branes ( p + 1 = p) provided the embedding man-

11

ifold is euclidean [11]. the euclidean ads2n space can be seen, not only as a o(2n, 1) -
model instanton, but also as a self-dual p-brane whose world volume is the ads2n space
(p + 1 = 2n = d dimensional). to see this we must rst write down dolan-tchrakian
action for a bosonic p-brane with p + 1 = 2n embedded in a at/curved target space of
dimensionality d = p + 1 = 2n. dolan-tchrakian action is valid for at or curved target
spacetime metrics [2].

s = t z d2n [ep1  ep2  ...  epn]  [(eq1  eq2  ....  eqn)]p1q1p2q2.....

(30)

the action is ym like ff and was derived based on the conformally invariant o(2n+1) -
model actions. the star operation in (30) is the standard hodge duality one dened w.r.t
the p + 1-dim world-volume metric of the p-brane : hab. the world-volume one-forms
, ep; p = 1, 2, ....2n are obtained as the pullbacks of the d = 2n = p + 1 one forms,
ea ; a = 1, 2, ....2n associated with the d = 2n dimensional at/curved target space onto
which we embed the world-volume of the p-brane. a self-dual p-brane ( self dual w.r.t the
hodge star operation) obeys :

[(eq1  eq2  ....  eqn)] = [ep1  ep2  ...  epn ].

(31)

a self-dual p-brane will automatically satisfy the equations of motion. this is the p-brane
generalization of the relation df = j = 0 in the absence of sources in the ym equations.
when f = f the latter equations become the bianchi identities df = 0. the action (30)
for a self-dual p-brane becomes then the integral over the ordinary jacobian ( p + 1 = 2n
volume form) associated with the change of variables   x and hence is topological. if
the world volume has a natural boundary an integration by parts ( gauss law) will yield
the chern-simons p = p  1-brane. in this way we can see once more how the self-dual
p-brane is related to the chern-simons p = p  1-brane ( at least on shell).
this is the rst step. one needs to show now that the self-duality condition (31) is
directly related to the self-duality condition formulated by zaikov when p + 1 = 2n and,
furthermore, that it is also related to the double-self duality conditions (10) associated with
the conformally invariant o(2n, 1) -models in r2n. the self-duality condition formulated
by zaikov when the embedding manifold is euclidean and when p + 1 = 4, for example, is
[11] :

f jk
ab = ax j bx k  bx j ax k =

1
4

abcdjklmf lm
cd .

(32)

where x i (a) are the embedding coordinates of the p-brane into the target space, x i; i =
1, 2, ...2n. eq-(32) is the self-duality condition for case when p = 3 ; p + 1 = 4 obtained
from dirac-nambu-goto actions. the dolan-tchrakian action (30) is equivalent at the
classical level to the dirac-nambu-goto actions upon elimination of the auxiliary world-
volume metric, hab. whether or not this equivalence occurs quantum mechanically is
another issue. hence, classically, zaikovs self-duality conditions (32) are equivalent to the
self-duality conditions (31) of the self-dual extendon furnished by dolan-tchrakian actions
(30).

12

now we must proceed with the connection between the latter self-duality for extendons
(p-branes) and the double self duality conditions associated with the o(2n, 1) -models.
the self-duality condition of zaikov has exactly the same form as the double self-duality
condition for the o(4) ym instanton (8a), obtained from the compact o(2n + 1)  model,
after using the constraint (7c), d(a)ni = 0 ; i = 1, 2, ...2n, 2n + 1 ( for the particular case
n = 2 ), and the relations (7a,7b) which allow to reduce o(5) to o(4) and show that the
o(4) ym eld is a composite eld expressed in terms of the ni. we need now to establish
the relations/correspondences between the p-brane coordinates x i(a) of (32) and the
o(4) ym composite elds of eqs-(7a,7b) appearing in eq-(8a). the ensuing relation is :

   x j (a). f 
a

   f jk

ab = ax j bx k  bx j a x k.

(33)

where  are the 2  2 matrices ( pauli) corresponding to the chiral representation
of so(4)  su (2)  su (2). the , .. indices in the l.h.s of (33) run over the four
dimensional base manifold r4 where the o(4) ym elds live. the i, j, k... in the r.h.s of
(33) run over the four-dimensional embedding target space . the a indices run over the
four-dimensional world volume of the p = 3-brane.

the last equation is reminiscent of the chiral model approaches to self dual gravity
based on self dual yang mills [31] theories. a moyal deformation quantization of the
nahm equations associated with a su (2) ym [32] theory yields the classical n  
limit of the su (n ) ym nahm equations directly, without ever using the  matrices
of the large n matrix models. by simply taking the classical h = 0 limit of the moyal
brackets, the ordinary poisson bracket algebra associated with area-preserving dis algebra
su () is automatically recovered. this supports furthermore the fact that the underlying
geometry may be noncommutative [18,32] and that p-branes are essentially gauge theories
of area/volume...preserving dis [14,20,21].

the way this is attained is the following. a moyal quantization takes the operator
a(x) into a(x; q, p) and commutators into moyal brackets. a dimensional reduction
to one temporal dimension brings a(t, q, p), which precisely corresponds to the membrane
coordinates x(t, 1, 2) after identifying a with q, p. the h = 0 limit turns the moyal
bracket into a poisson one. it is in this fashion how the large n su (n ) matrix model
bears a relation to the physics of membranes. the moyal quantization explains this in a
straightforward fashion without having to use    matrices !
therefore, the self-duality conditions of the dolan-tchrakian p-brane actions in eu-
clidean embedding manifolds ( for the case p+1 = 4) (31) have a one-to-one correspondence
with zaikovs self-duality conditions (32) ( for euclidean embedding manifolds) and with
the double self-duality conditions of the o(4) ym instanton (8a), if, and only if, the
gauge f ields/target space coordinates correspondence (33) is used.

finally, if the euclidean signature ads2n space is to be seen as a self-dual p-brane;
i.e. as the euclideanized world-volume of an open self-dual p-brane such p + 1 = 2n, in
addition to an o(2n, 1) -model instanton in r2n, we must analytically continue o(2n, 1)
to o(2n + 1) and , afterwards, follow the same procedure as above, relating the o(5) -
model to o(4) ym and its generalized yang-mills extensions in d = 2n = 4k dimensions
[10]. for example, one could rst reduce o(4, 1) to o(3, 1) using equations like (7a,7b,7c)

13

and perform aftewards the analytical continuation o(3, 1) to o(4) . it is important to have
a compact group like o(4) otherwise we will run into the same problems of non-positive
denite actions, hamiltonians...

to sum up, the arguments ranging from eqs-(31-33), are the necessary ones required
that would allow us to view the euclidean ads2n space as the euclideanized world volume
of an open self-dual p-brane ( p + 1 = 2n) in addition to being an o(2n, 1) -model
instanton . in section 3.2 we will present further evidence which suggests that there is
a formal equivalence between the two denitions of duality ; i.e after using the gauge
elds/coordinates correspondence (33) one may be able to show that the euclidean ads2n
space is the euclideanized world volume of an open self-dual p-brane ( p + 1 = 2n) in
addition to being an o(2n, 1) -model instanton.

after having presented the discussion of the self-dual p-branes /chern-simons p =
p1-branes relationship in target spacetimes of dimension d = p+1 = p+2 = 2n = 4k, we
will choose a particular higher dimensional example. the topological chern-simons action
for the p = 10-brane is dened over the d = 11-boundary domain of r12 . boundary
to-boundary maps are a special class, among the innite family of embeddings of the
chern-simons p = 10-brane into ads12, which conformally map the d = 11-dim boundary
domain into the projective boundary of the ads12 space : which is topologically s1  s10.
the euclidean signature ads12 has, instead, for projective boundary the s11. the
signature matching condition (16a) imposes the signature of the base manifold to be eu-
clidean . if one views r12 as the interior of a twelve-dimensional ball, b12 of very large
() radius, the d = 11 boundary domain is eectively s11 . therefore, for the very special
case associated with boundary to-boundary maps, the chern-simons p = 10-brane can be
characterized by the winding number of the mappings of s11  s11 . in this special case,
the chern-simons p = 10-brane lives eectively on the projective boundary of euclidean
ads12. we emphasize that this is just a particular case, since in general, the topological
chern-simons p = 10-brane lives on the whole bulk of ads12. since the chern-simons
p = 10-brane theory is topological, it has no local bulk degrees of freedom, only global,
that are naturally conned to the boundary. in this sense the theory is holographic [27,28].
furthermore, since ads12 can be seen as a hyperboloid embedded in a d = 13-dim
pseudo-euclidean manifold we have d = 11, 12, 13 for characteristic dimensions; hence this
construction may be relevant to understand the intricate relations of m, f, s theory [25,26]
and to shed some light into the geometrical, holographic and topological underpinnings
behind the ads/cft duality conjecture.

a chern-simons p = 11-brane living on a euclidean signature ads13 embedded in
a d = 14-dim pseudo euclidean space has for world volume a 12-dim manifold. in this
case the relevant dimensions would be 11, 12, 13, 14. the main dierence is that the odd
dimensional ads13 will not corespond to an instanton conguration associated with an
o(13, 1) -model because in odd dimensions conformally invariant sigma models of the
dolan-tchrakian type cannot be constructed. higher dimensional topological actions have
been proposed by chapline to describe unique theories of gravity and matter [24].

3.2 branes from moyal deformation quantization of gym theories

14

chern simons membranes and hadronic bags from quenched large n qcd

su (n ) reduced, quenched gauge theories have been shown to be related to string
theories in the large n limit. we will review very briey the steps that show how a
4d ym reduced, quenched, theory supplemented by a topological  term can be related,
through a weyl wigner groenowold moyal (wwgm) quantization procedure, to an open
3  brane model [35] . the bulk is the interior of a hadronic bag and the boundary is
the chern-simons world volume of a membrane. the boundary dynamics is not trivial
despite the fact that there are no transverse bulk dynamics associated with the interior of
the bag. for further details we refer to [35] .

the reduced and quenched ym action in d = 4 is [36] :

s =

omitting the matrix su (n ) indices.

the  term is :

(35)

the wwgm quantization establishes a one-to-one correspondence bewteen a linear
operator d acting on the hilbert space h of square integrable functions on rd and a
smooth function a(x, y) which is the inverse fourier transform of a(q, p). the latter
is obtained by evaluating the trace of the operator d by means of summing over the
diagonal elements with respect to an orthonormal basis in the hilbert space h. under
the wwgm correspondence the matrix product turns into the moyal  product and the
commutator turns into the moyal bracket :

(39b)

and by taking the deformation parameter h of the wwm quantization to be 2/n =
h = 0 then the  classical limit  is nothing but the equivalent of the large n limit. hence,
the moyal brackets turn into poisson brackets, the factors of n decouple and the rst
action (37) is just equivalent to the dolan-tchrakian action evaluated in the conformal
gauge. the second action (38) is the chern-simons zaikov action for a membrane whose
world volume lives on 3-dim the boundary of the hadronic bag. upon identifying the
inverse lattice spacing of the large n quenched, reduced qcd with the qcd scale of
(2/a) = qcd = 200 m ev we obtained the value of the dynamically generated bag
pressure o given by :

taking for the conventionally assumed value of g2
y m /4  0.18 we get an actual value
for the hadronic bag constant o close to the value of qcd = 200 m ev which falls
within the range of the phenomenologically accepted values of o  110 m ev, if we
take into account the uncertainty on the value of the qcd which lies in the range of :
120 m ev < qcd < 350 m ev. one should notice also the interesting fact. if one sets the
qcd scale a to be :

(40b)

p lanckn = a4 nite as n   and l4

one makes contact with maldacenas celebrated result which relates the size of the anti
de sitter space throat a4 with the t hooft coupling n g2
p lanck (
gravity ) . the large n limit, or strong coupling limit, is implemented by the double scaling
relation l4
p lanck  0. hence, relations (40a, 40b)
very naturally reect maldacenas result which support his ads/cf t duality conjecture
obtained from a completely dierent approach that did not require compactications. true,
we need to work further to show why a4 = n l4
p lanck , howgravity emerges. since we
obtained brane actions from ym ( gym) theories via the moyal deformation quantization
and branes do contain gravity it is not surprising to arrive at similar results.

y m and the planck scale l4

to extend these results to higher p-branes than p = 3 one needs to perform the moyal
deformation of generalized yang mills theories (gym) as shown by [1, 34, 35 ] . the
gym are based on so(4k) in rd where d = 4k :

1
g2 tr (f 12........2k
where g is a dimensionless coupling constant and :

l =

12....2k 12........2k)2.

12........2k = 1234 ...

16

(41)

(42)

is an anti-symmetrized product of k factors of the 22k122k1 matrices  corresponding
to the chiral representation of so(4k) . for k = 1 one has the usual so(4)  so(3) 
so(3) whose double cover is su (2)  su (2). for further details we refer to [1,34].
the analogous procedure of quenching and reduction is attained by looking only at
the zero mode sector of the theory. one can write down the action for those eld strength
congurations that are everywhere constant. a local gauge transformation will rotate them
to other eld strength congurations that are space-time dependent. since the invariant
action requires performing a a group trace to attain gauge invariance, one may simply
focus, from the start, on those eld strength congurations that are everywhere constant.
performing a wwgm deformation of the lie algebraic structure in each single one of
the subfactors  appearing in the denition of the so(4k)-valued eld strenghts and
integrating out the spacetime dependence one arrives [34] :

4k

g2 z d4k [ {a1 , a2}{a3 , a4}.......{a2k1, a2k}]2.

(43)

where 4k is the spacetime volume resulting from the spacetime integration of constant
eld congurations ( zero modes ). taking the h = 0 classical limit and establishing the
gauge elds/coordinates a  (x/lp) correspondence ( units require dividing by the
planck scale lp ) one arrives at the follwoing p-brane action and tension :

4k
g2l8k

p z d4k [ {x1 , x2}{x3 , x4}.......{x2k1, x2k}]2. tp =

4k
g2l8k
p

.

(44)

notice that the elds in the reduced-quenched su (n ) qcd action do not have the canon-
ical dimensions. they are rescaled [35]. the action (44) is equivalent to the dt action
[34] in the conformal gauge. as before, this bulk action does not have transverse degrees
of freedom : one simply can choose the orthonormal gauge to see that this action reduces
to a pure bulk volume term. equivalent to the dt action after choosing the coformal
gauge. however, the analog of a the topological theta terms are not trivial. the have
true boundary dynamics and these correspond naturally to the chern-simons p-branes
discussed earlier. following the same steps as we did for the theta terms in the reduced,
quenched large n qcd action one can verify that the lagrangian density for the  terms
:

l   g2 1....n1....ntr (f 12........2k

12....2k 12........2k)(f 12........2k

12....2k 12........2k). (45)

will yield the zaikov chern-simons p-brane actions after performing the wwgm
deformation of the lie algebraic structure. upon taking the h = 0 limit; identifying the
traces with integrals over the phase space variables which later are identied with the
world volume coordinates , and establishing the gauge eld/coordinates correspondence
one ends up with :

scs 

4kg2

l8k
p

z d4k dx1  dx2  .........  dx4k .

(46)

17

after an integration by parts that will yield the zaikov chern-simons p- brane action
integrated over the 4k  1-dim boundary so that the value of p must obey p + 1 = 4k  1.
having shown that certain brane actions and the associated chern-simons branes,
can be obtained from a moyal deformation of the lie algebraic bracket structure of the
ym ( gym) theories and that chern-simons membranes and hadronic bags emerge from
a reduced, quenched large n qcd in four dimensions, for example, allows to conrm once
more what have established in this work :

 topological chern-simons p-branes and conformally invariant  models on ads
spaces are related and connected with so(4k) generalized ym theories in r4k ( where
k = 2n).

 we have closed the web among three related theories : (i) chern-simons p-branes
on ads2n spaces with p + 2 = 2n; (ii) o(2n, 1) conformally invariant  models in r2n
with target euclideanized ads2n backgrounds and (iii ) obtained branes from a moyal
deformation of so(4k) gym theories in r2n = r4k .

 also , the relationship between self duality and conformal invariance has been es-
tablished : the euclidean signature ads2n space was shown to correspond precisely to
instanton eld congurations of the noncompact o(2n, 1) -models in r2n, obeying the
double self duality condition (10), which was the analog of the bpst instanton [9].

3.3 w geometry

to nalize we shall mention our belief in the importance that w symmetry and its
higher dimensional extensions should have in understanding m theory . w geometry was
viewed as the geometry associated with the moyal-fedosov deformation program associ-
ated with the symplectic geometry of the cotangent bundles of 2d riemannian surfaces;
the role of 4d self dual gravity was also emphasized in [18]. geometric induced actions
for w gravity based on the coadjoint orbit method associated with sl(, r) wznw
models were constructed by nissimov, pacheva and vaysburd [23]. w gravity has a hid-
den sl(, r) kac-moody symmetry. likewise, the sl() toda model obtained from a
rotational killing symmetry reduction of 4d self dual gravity ( an eective 3d theory)
has w symmetry. once again we can see the intricate relationship between self duality
and conformal eld theory in higher dimensions.

to this end we concentrate now on what perhaps is the most signicant and salient
feature of chern-simons p-branes : the fact that they admit an innite number of sec-
ondary constraints which form an innite dimensional closed algebra with respect to the
poisson bracket. [11] such algebra contains the clasical w1+ as a subalgebra . the latter
algebra corresponds to the area-preserving dieomorphisms of a cylinder.; the w alge-
bra corresponds to the area-preserving dis of a plane; su() for a sphere.....[14]. these
w algebras are the higher conformal spin s = 2, 3, 4..... algebraic extensions of the 2d
virasoro algebra.
higher spin algebras ( superalgebras) in dimensions greater than two have been fur-
nished by vasiliev and in [15] were used to describe higher spin gauge interactions of massive
particles in ads3 spaces. these higher spin algebras have been instrumental lately in [16]
to construct the n = 8 higher spin supergravity in ads4 which is conjectured to be the
eld theory limit of m theory on ads4  s7.
18

crucial in the construction of the vasiliev higher spin algebras is the moyal star
products and the fact that these algebras required an anti de sitter space. for the relevance
of moyal brackets in m theory we refer to fairlie [19]. it has been speculated that the
w-symmetry of w strings after a higgs-like spontaneous symmetry breakdown yields
the innite massive tower of string states. in particular, anomaly free non-criticial (super)
w strings required (d = 11) d = 27 dimensions [22] which are precisely the alleged
critical dimensions of the ( super) membrane.

moyal star products are non-local due to the innite number of derivatives. this
nonlocality in conjunction with the fact that anti de sitter spaces are required may be
relevant in understanding more properties of singleton, doubleton...eld theories which are
very important in the ads/cf t duality conjecture. the massless excitations of the cf t
living on the projective boundary of anti de sitter space, associated with the propagation
of the supermembrane on adsd  sdd, are composites of singleton, doubletons...elds
[17]. the o(5) sigma models actions (8c) and the corresponding o(4)y m elds in eqs-
(7a,7b) are based on composite f ields ; i.e made out of the ni(x). new actions for all
p-branes where the analogs of s and t duality symmetries were built in, already from
the start, were given in [20] based on the composite antisymmetric tensor eld theories of
the volume-preserving dis group of guendelman, nissimov , pacheva and the local eld
theory reformulation of extended objects given by aurilia, spallucci and smailagic [21].
this supports the idea that compositeness may be a crucial ingredient in the formulation
of m theory.

4. concluding remarks

based on the relation established in this work among conformally invariant  models
on ads spaces, chern-simons p-branes, w geometry , including the moyal deformation
quantization of generalized yang mills theories (gym) ( plus theta terms ) to yield brane
actions ( plus chern-simons branes ) that have as an example the chern-simons membrane
and hadronic bag solutions to the quenched large n limit of su (n )d = 4 qcd , we
believe that m theory should have some of the features described below :

 higher dimensional topological and holographic origins. a particular example of
this theory is the topological chern-simons p = 10-brane living on the bulk of ads12,
without local degres of freedom , with only global degrees of freedom conned to the
d = 11 dimensional boundary. since ads12 can be embedded in a d = 13 dimensional
pseudo euclidean space, d = 13 is a relevant dimension [24]. .

above, to higher dimensions.

 a w geometric framework extending the role of ordinary 2d cft, as explained
 a compositeness structure, like the conformally invariant sigma models in r2n with
target noncompact o(2n, 1) group manifolds and where the euclidean signature ads2n
space is an instanton solution, obeying a double self duality condition, and a self-dual
p- extendon, with p + 1 = 2n ( assuming that the there is a one-to-one correspondence
between the two).

 the supersymmetric case has not been discussed here but it must be included.
 we close this work with an interesting thought. the n   limit of the o(2n, 1) -
models is connected with the d = 2n   limit of the ads2n space. interestingly enough,

19

zaikov has pointed out that in the d =  limit these chern-simons p-branes acquire true
local dynamics !
