abstract

we study solutions corresponding to moving domain walls in the randall-
sundrum universe. the bulk geometry is given by patching together black hole
solutions in ads5, and the motion of the wall is determined from the junction
equations. observers on the wall interpret the motion as cosmological expansion
or contraction. we describe the possible wall trajectories, and examine the
consequences for localized gravity on the wall.

1 introduction

randall and sundrum [1] have recently discovered a novel way of embedding four
dimensional physics within a higher dimensional world. in their setup a four dimen-
sional domain wall sits at a point in an innite but highly curved fth dimension,
and a single normalizable zero mode of the gravitational eld gives rise to newtonian
gravity at large distances on the wall. the geometry as a whole is that of two regions
of ads5 joined by the domain wall.

the presence of four dimensional poincare invariance requires a precise value for
the domain wall tension. however, it is also of interest to consider non-poincare
invariant solutions, both to better understand the mechanism of localized gravity and
for possible cosmological applications. when the tension is not ne-tuned or there
is additional matter on the wall, time dependent solutions typically result. loosely
speaking, such time dependence can come in two forms. as studied in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], one
can nd cosmological solutions in which the bulk geometry is time dependent. here
we study the alternative case in which the bulk remains static but the domain wall
acquires a velocity. observers on the wall will interpret the motion of the wall through
the static background as cosmological expansion or contraction. more generally, one

can combine the two forms of time dependence to nd a large class of solutions, but
that will not be considered here. of course, given any moving domain wall one can
always transform coordinates to put it at rest, hence there is some overlap with the
solutions found in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and those described here.

the equations of motion of the wall are found by a straightforward application
of the thin wall formalism in general relativity [7], in which einsteins equations
are rewritten as junction conditions relating the discontinuity in the walls extrinsic
curvature to its energy-momentum tensor. we will consider the general solutions
which have the symmetries of the standard robsertson-walker geometries. depending
on the choice of parameters, we nd bounded and unbounded wall trajectories, with
both exponential and power law expansion in the latter case.

our solutions are generally not described by regions of ads5 in the bulk, but
rather by black hole solutions which reduce to ads5 as a non-extremality parameter
is taken to zero. this has interesting implications for solutions in which the domain
wall is slowly moving, so that one might expect to recover four dimensional gravity as
in [1]. if taken to be too large, the event horizon of the black hole will render the zero
mode nonnormalizable, and so destroy the eective four dimensional behavior. small
horizons result in zero modes, but the bulk solution has reduced symmetry compared
to ads5. the lack of lorentz invariance in the bulk manifests itself as a shift in the
propagation speed of gravitational uctuations on the wall, although the shift rapidly
becomes negligible as the wall universe expands.

eventually, one would like a microscopic description of the domain wall, either as
a smooth solution of supergravity (along the lines of [8, 9, 10]) or as a fundamental
brane of string theory. the present analysis is applicable to the former case in the
thin wall limit. as an attempt to realize the latter we conclude by describing a
conguration involving a spherical distribution of d3-branes, which ends up being
unsuccessful due to the low value of the d3-brane tension.

dynamical domain walls have also been studied recently in [11, 12].

we have allowed for a boundary m with induced metric ab, shortly to be identied
with the domain wall. k is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary

k  = n,

(2)

where n is the unit normal vector on m. we are interested in patching two such
regions together across a domain wall with four dimensional energy-momentum tensor
tab. it is convenient to work in gaussian normal coordinates near the domain wall,

ds2 = abdxadxb + d2,

(3)

with the wall at  = 0. then einsteins equations imply the junction conditions [7]:

where

kab = k +

ab = kab( = )  kab( = ).

(5)

the relative minus sign arises because we have chosen the convention that n points
towards the region of increasing . in the coordinates (3) the extrinsic curvature is

ab.

(6)

we refer to an extremal wall as one with energy-momentum tensor tab = ab,
in which case the junction conditions become

kab =

ab.

(7)

we will consider bulk solutions that have the symmetries of at, open, and closed
robertson-walker universes. further, we restrict attention to static bulk geometries.
the solutions of einsteins equations with the assumed properties are

(8)

k takes the values 0, 1, +1, corresponding to at, open, or closed geometries, and
d2
k is the corresponding metric on the unit three dimensional plane, hyperboloid,
or sphere. the k = 1 solution is perhaps unfamiliar, but has been studied in [13,
14, 15]. when  = 0 the solutions are simply ads5 written in various coordinates,
whereas  6= 0 gives black hole solutions with horizons at r = rh,

h =

(k +qk2 + 4/2).

k = 0, 1 requires   0, and k = 1 requires   2/4.

the domain wall separating two such spacetimes (with the same k) is taken to
be situated at r = r(t), where r(t) will be determined by solving the junction
equations. as in the randall-sundrum geometry, r is taken to decrease as one moves
away from the wall in either direction. one way to determine the junction equations
is to transform to gaussian normal coordinates and use the formula (6). however, it
is simpler to rewrite the equations in a coordinate independent form. let u be the
velocity vector of the wall, uu = 1. then the unit normal satisies nu = 0, and
we can rewrite (6) as

let us apply this to the metric

r, nr = (fk + r2)1/2. the minus sign arises
to proper time  . then nt = f 1
because the coordinate r is decreasing in the direction n. there are two nontrivial
junction equations corresponding to the time and space components of (10). the
spatial components of the extrinsic curvature are

(13)

(14)

it turns out that the junction equation for ktt just gives the proper time derivative
of the equations above, so we need not consider it further.

the junction equation determines r( ), and so also the induced metric on the

domain wall:

where we have dened c  3/(4g). the randall-sundrum conguration results
from taking k = + =  = 0, and tuning the wall tension to be  = c. we now
explore some of the possibilities that arise when we relax these conditions.

first consider the case + =  = 0, in which the bulk geometries are regions of

ads5. there are nine cases corresponding to the various values of  and k:

 = c, k = 0: this gives the randall-sundrum conguration.

 = c, k = 1: r( ) =  . wall passes between r = 0 and r = , and crosses
the coordinate horizon r =  in nite proper time.

 = c, k = +1: no solution.

 > c, k = 0: r = r0eh .
 > c, k = 1: r = 2
 > c, k = +1: r = 2

h cosh h .

 < c, k = 0: no solution.
 < c, k = 1: r = 2
 < c, k = +1: no solution.

h cos h .

here h = 1

in the three  > c cases the wall metric is de-
sitter space, while in the  < c case it is anti-de sitter space. these solutions have
appeared in dierent coordinates in the work of [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

q|(/c)2  1|.

now let us turn to the case where +,  6= 0. the cases  > c,  < c are
qualitatively similar to those described above, either inationary behavior for large
r or bounded motion. note, though, that the possibility of + +  < 0 for k = 1
allows v (r) to have nontrivial local maxima. the detailed forms of the trajectories
can be found by integrating the equation of motion (16). we now consider the three
 = c cases:

 = c, k = 0: unbounded motion passing between r = 0 and r( )  21/4(+ +
)1/4||1/2. for large r the wall metric is that of a spatially at radiation dominated
cosmology.

 = c, k = 1: unbounded motion passing between r = 0 and r( )  ||.

 = c, k = +1: wall expands from r = 0 to maximum size, v (rmax) = 1/2, and
recollapses.

2.2 four dimensional description

it is interesting to consider the case  = c, k = 0, +,  6= 0 in more detail. at
late times,   (+ + )1/2, the wall universe is slowly expanding and it becomes
meaningful to ask whether, as in [1], conventional gravity in four approximately at
spacetime dimensions is recovered for distances large compared to  but small com-
pared to ( r/r)1. the latter condition means that we can take r to be constant
over the time scale of interest. for simplicity, take + =  = , so that at late times
the bulk geometry is that of the randall-sundrum conguration except that the bulk
spacetime is the black hole geometry (8). there are two important new features: the
innite throat as r  0 has been replaced by an event horizon at r = rh = 1/21/4,
and four dimensional lorentz invariance has been broken. to study the implications
in a simplied setting we will replace the gravitational uctuations with those of a
massless bulk scalar eld. when rh is set to zero, the scalar eld has an r independent
normalizable zero mode,  = (t, ~x), which appears as a massless four dimensional
scalar eld on the domain wall. we can study the fate of the zero mode by examining
the wave equation near the horizon using the coordinate r = (2/4rh) ln((r  rh)/).
writing  = eit+i~k~x(r) the wave equation becomes

(cid:18)2
r + 2 

4
rh

e4rhr/2~k2(cid:19) (r) = 0.

(18)

we see that there is no normalizable mode for  6= 0, which seems to imply the lack
of a massless eld on the wall. on the other hand, we know that such a mode exists
for rh = 0 and we expect the limit rh  0 to be smooth. the resolution is that for
small rh the geometry near the horizon is not reliable, and so we should impose a
cuto on the range of r. to implement this we work out the action of the candidate
zero mode  = (t, ~x):

s =

2 z d5xgg = z d4x z r

rc

dr r3


(t)2

r2 )

+

r2

.

(19)

now, the trouble arises from attempting to take rc  rh; instead, for small rh we
impose the cuto rc =  corresponding to the region where trans-planckian curvatures
begin to set in (we have in mind that   pl). then evaluating the integrals and
expanding in rh we nd, assuming r  :
2 z d4x "2 1 +

2r2! (t)2 + (~)2# .

s = 

(20)

rescaling  and expressing the result in terms of the domain wall metric ab we
obtain:

s = 

r4
h

2r2! tt (t)2 + ijij# ,

2 z d4x" 1 +

(21)

(22)

which is the standard form except that the speed of light has been shifted to

cef f  1 

1
2

r4
h
2r2 .

we stress that this formula holds only when the correction term is small, and that the
precise correction is not meaningful since it is sensitive to the position of the cuto.
if the standard model elds live on the domain wall then their behavior is lorentz
invariant with the standard speed of light c = 1, whereas gravitational interactions
(assuming that the scalar eld results can be extrapolated to gravity) propagate at a
slightly shifted speed due to the loss of lorentz invariance in the bulk. in addition,
we expect the tensor and momentum structure of the gravitational interactions suer
small lorentz violating corrections. as the universe expands, r becomes large and
these eects rapidly become negligible.

finally, in the case where rh is large compared to , we expect the four dimensional

description to be invalid due to the lack a normalizable zero mode.

2.3 matter on the wall

as an example in which expansion results from matter on the domain wall, we consider
the case k = 0 and energy-momentum tensor

tab = cab + uaub +

1
3

(ab + uaub)

(23)

corresponding to massless radiation. energy conservation requires  = 0/r4 with
constant 0. the junction equation is found to be

(f +

k + r2)1/2 + (f 

k + r2)1/2 =

8g(c + )

r.

(24)

for   c the potential becomes

(25)

hence the situation is qualitatively the same as the  = c, + +  > 0 case
considered previously. in particular, for large times r( )  const   1/2 as expected
for a radiation dominated cosmology.

3 attempt at a string theory realization

it is desirable to have an embedding of the randall-sundrum geometry into string
theory. here we briey describe a largely unsuccessful attempt based on a spherical
shell of d3-branes 2. the construction fails because the tension of a d3-brane turns
out to be too small by a factor of 3/2.

s 5,

as is well known, the near horizon geometry of a collection of d3-branes is ads5

ds2 = 

r2
2 dt2 + r2(d~x)2 +

r2 dr2 + 2d2
5.

(26)

 is related to the number of d3-branes by 4 = 4gn()2. in addition, there are
n units of ve-form ux present. now, we attempt to patch two such regions with
opposite ve-form orientations together along a boundary of constant r. to satisfy
charge conservation we need the boundary to carry 2n units of charge. we do this
while preserving approximate so(6) symmetry by distributing 2n d3-branes over
the s 5. the branes are at coincident r positions, and their worldvolumes span t, ~x.
to preserve approximate so(6) symmetry we require that the inter-brane spacing
on s 5 be much smaller than the characteristic scale of the geometry . this requires
n  1.

now, the tension of 2n d3-branes is, in terms of the ve dimensional newton

constant,

 =

2g

=

c.

(27)

hence the tension is too low to patch two such ads5  s 5 regions together in this
manner. the only possibility is a time dependent k = 1 solution as discussed earlier.
such a solution collapses to a singularity in a time scale of order .
