(2.23) perturbative expansion string eld theory, expand string eld component elds, example, tachyon eld vector eld, product component elds resulting eective action turns product functions noncommutative space. therefore, low-energy eective theory becomes noncommutative yang-mills theory. also, theory, open string metric gij, closed one gij. agreement result . 3. background independence string field theory background independent formulation string theory, pregeometrical string eld theories proposed {$9711162$}, dropped kinetic terms actions ordinary string eld theories minkowski space kept cubic term. 7 drop kinetic term string eld theory, may expect resulting theory pregeometrical theory footing theory proposed {$9711162$}. section, show case. although seems depend theta parameter ij, nd background dependence absorbed redenition string eld resulting theory turns theory {$9711162$}. addition, explicitly show oscillator representation three-string vertex also independent gij. application method given kugo zwiebach {$9711162$} wittens open string eld theory. {$9711162$}, background independence discussed = p+ closed hikko theory compactied torus. kugo zwiebach proposed x i() pi() indepen- dent background elds. therefore read dependence oscillators background elds, allows us explicitly verify terms oscillators three-string vertex background independent. however, open string eld theory, coordinates x i() longer universal objects, commutation relation string coordinates depends (2.2). objects regard universal ones? eq.
