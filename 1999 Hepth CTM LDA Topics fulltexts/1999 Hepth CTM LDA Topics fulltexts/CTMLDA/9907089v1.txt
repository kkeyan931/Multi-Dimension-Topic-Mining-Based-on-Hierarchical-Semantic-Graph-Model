we show that the chiral gross-neveu model for a small number n of fermions has two character-
istic temperatures: tc that corresponds to restoration of long-range or quasi-long-range order and
t (> tc) that corresponds to thermal fermion pairs breaking. we show that the region tc < t < t 
is characterized by a complex gap function |(x)|ei(x) with nonzero gap modulus || but random
phase (x) so there is no phase coherence and system behaves like a gas of non-condesed composite
bosons. condensation (or quasicondensation, in the case of purely two-dimensional system) of pre-
formed pairs in the regime of low n can not be described at the mean-eld level so we extract lowest
gradient terms and set up an eective xy-model with temperature dependent stiness coecent that
serves for description of the onset of the phase coherence (or description of the kosterlitz-thouless
transition in a purely 2d system).
in the regime of large n we show that temperature of the
phase transition of xy-model tends from below to temperature of the pair formation and merges
with it in the limit n   thus recovering mean-eld scenario for the onset of long-range (or
quasi-long-range) order in this model.

i. introduction

the gross-neveu (gn) model [1], is exactly solvable in the limit of n   eld theoretic model of zero-mass
fermions with quartic interaction which provide us with insight into the mechanisms of spontaneous symmetry break-
down. purpose of this paper is to consider, in analogy to strong-coupling superconductor, low-n behavior of the
chiral gross-neveu model in which fermions form bound states similar to the cooper pairs. at low temperatures in
dimensions higher than two these pairs are condesed, and symmetry is brocken. in exactly two dimensions there is no
strict long-range order however except for high-temperature disordered phase there is kosterlits-thouless transition
to phase with quasi-long range order [2].

we show that at low n , mean-eld scenario according to which condensation or quasicondensation of fermion
pairs happens at the same temperature as their formation is qualitetively wrong and phase diagram of gross-neveu
model should contain a pseudogap phase which is a region where exists nonzero gap modulus (or preformed pairs)
but there is no phase coherence or no quasi-long range oreder (phenomenon well-known from o(2) sigma model). in
order to describe this region we should incorporate into the theory pairs with non-zero momentum a thus we should
go beyond mean-eld approximation by extracting lowest gradient terms and setting up an eective xy-model that
serves for nonperturbative description of the onset and disapearence of the phase coherence. this procedure was
applied before by author for description of analogous pseudogap phenomena in strong-coupling superconductivity [3].
in the case of chiral gross-neveu model in 2 +  dimensions at zero tempereature we discussed in analogous way
depletion of condensate by quantum uctuation [4] which resembles superconductor-insulator transition in condesed
matter physics.

ii. gross-neveu model

in this section we begin with outlining well-known general properties of the ordinary and chiral gross-neveu models

[5,4]. the original gross-neveu model has the following o(n )-symmetric lagrange density

where the index a runs from 1 to n . at the mean-eld level, the eective action is equal to the initial action

c. chiral gross-neveu model at nite temperature

let us start nite temperature analysis with mean-eld approximation.

in order to consider system at nite
temperature we impose antiperiodic condition for imaginary time variable  with period  = 1/t and substitute
momentum integral by a sum over matsubara frequencies n = 2i1(n + 1

2 ):

(2)d = 1xn

then from eective potential follows nite-temperature gap equation (compare with (12)):

performing the sum we obtain:

(36)

where e stands for pp2 + m 2.

within mean-eld analysis we have situation similar to bcs superconductor when at certain temperature due to
thermal pair breaking gap disappears. in what follows we shall call this temperure of thermal decomposition of cooper
pairs t . it can be expressed via gap at zero temperature in two space dimentions with the following equation:

where m (0) is gap function at zero temperature. from this equation we obtain

iii. classical chiral fluctuations

let us now derive propagator of the imaginary part of the eld  (33) at nonzero temperature. for 1/g0 +

after summation over matsubara frequencies and integration we arrive in the case of two space dimentions to the

iv. separation of the temperatures of the thermal pair decomposition and

pair condensation or quasicondensation

as was mentioned in the introduction, in strictly two dimentions there is no long-range order in a system with
with o(2)-symmetry but as we know from the works of berezinskii and kosterlitz and thouless [2] such a system
possesses except for high-temperature disordered phase a low-temperature almost order phase. in two dimensions
macroscopic excitations of the form of vortices and antivortices attract to each other by a coulomb potential, just
like a gas of electrons an positrons. at low temperatures, the vortices and antivortices form bound pairs. the grand-
canonical ensemble of pairs exhibits quasi-long-range correlations. at some temperature tkt , the vortex pairs break
up, and the correlations becomes short-range [10].

in the case of 2 +  and higher dimensions we have proper long-range order.

a. failure of mean-field approximation for description of symmetry breaking in strong-coupling

superconductor and gross-neveu model at low n

celebrated bcs theory of superconductivity is a mean-eld theory and describes superconductivity as a pair
formation - i.e. when pairs form at certain temperature they have zero momentum and thus are in condesate.
obviously critical temperature in this case is proportional to energy of the pair binding. n   mean-eld treatment
of the gross-neveu model is quite similar to bcs theory of superconductivity. let us imagine for a moment that
we were able to bind cooper pairs in a superconductor innitely tightly - obviously this implies that characteristic
temperature of thermal pair decomposition will be also innitely high, hovewer this does not imply that long-range
order will survive at ininitely high temperatures - it will be destroyed in a similar way as it happens superuid he4 i.e.
tightly bound cooper pairs at certain temperature will acquire nonzero momentum thus we will have gas of tightly
bound cooper pairs but no macroscopic occupation of of zero momentum level q = 0 and thus no long-range order.
in order to describe superconductivity in a system with a strong attractive interaction theory should incorporate
pairs with nonzero momentum and thus mean-eld treatment is invalid for description of spontanious symmetry
breaking in such a system (see ??, ?? and references therein). this scenario can as well be understood in the
following manner: at rst we can derive eective potential of strong-coupling superconductor, say in simplest case
it will be a mexican hat potential that disappears at certain temperature. the eective potential determined size of
the complex gap function  = ei(x). bcs theory postulates that phase is constant and thus if we have eective

6

potential we have spontaneous symmetry breakdown. however it will not be alwais the case if we have tightly bound
cooper pairs which can be seen if we go beyond mean-eld approximation by extracting lowest gradient term and
setting up an eective 3d xy-model with temperature dependent stiness coecent, for description of the onset or
disappearence of the phase coherence (as it was done in [3]). with it we can see that in the weak-coupling limit
temperature of the phase transition in the eective xy-model tends from below to characteristic temperature of the
disappearence of the eective potential and merges with it for innitesimaly weak coupling strength thus recovering
in this limit if nonzero modulus of the complex gap function  = ei(x) appears at some
bcs behavior( i.e.
temperature, at the same temperature establishes phase coherence.

in opposite limit of strong couplings we can see that temperature t  of the disappearence of the eective potential
obviously continues to grow with coupling strength whereas phase stiness of the eective xy model (and with it
temperature of the onset of phase coherence tc) tends exponentialy to a constant value n
4m that corresponds to the
phase stiness of the bose gas with density n/2 and mass 2m [3]. thus we have a large region between t  and tc that
is characterised by a complex gap function ||ei(x) with nonzero gap modulus || but random phase (x) so average
< ||ei(x) > is zero and thus no continuous symmetry is brocken, phenomenon well known from o(2) sigma-model.
1 2

similar separation of the temperature of the pair formation and kosterlits-thouless transition can be found in the
case of two-dimensional superconductor (see [3] and references therein). as well as the same argumets were used
in our previous paper for description of condesate depletion due to quantum uctuations in the chiral gross-neveu
model at zero temperature and low n in 2 +  dimensions [4]. there in the regime of low n existence of the analogous
phase separation was shown. namely it was observed that phase stifness of the eective xy-model tends to plateau
value n/4 that depends only on number of n and in contrast to the gap function does not depends on the coupling
strenth and .

it should be noted as well that in the case of 3d superconductor, strong-coupling regime can be treated perturba-
tively as well (see for example ??, ??,?? and references therein) in particular interaction between composite bosons
can be taken into the account in the next-next-to mean-eld approximation and eective gross-pitaevskii can be
derived in the strong-coupling limit [8] which allows to show that in the strong coupling limit system can be mapped
onto the ideal bose gas. at the same time as was shown in [3] in order to describe onset and disappearence of the
phase coherence in the entire weak-to-strong coupling crossover region it is sucient to extract lowest gradient term
and set up an eective 3d xy- model.

b. phase disorder transition due to thermal uctuations

let us start with 2d considerations. phase disorder transition is most easily understood in a model eld theory

involving a pure phase eld (x), with a hamiltonian

h =

j
2

[(x)]2,

(45)

where j is the stiness of the -uctuations. the important feature of the phase eld  is that it is a cyclic eld with
 =  + 2. [2]. after including vortices and antivortices at positions xi, xj , their partition function can be written
as

where r0 is the size of the vortices. for a single vortex-antivortex pair, the average square distance r2 is

qiqi

1
2

t xi<j

log(|xi  xj |/r0)


z = xgas

exp
42 j


,

(46)

1in the case of superconductor this crossover also take place as a function of carrier density with bcs limit corresponding to
high carrier density
2 pseudogap behavior is observed experimentaly in underdoped high-tc cuprates where pseudogap manifests itself as an
essential suppresion of low- frequency spectral weight well above tc (which is strictly zero in the case of superconductive gap)
with the same magnitute and wave vector dependence as superconductive gap. nmr experiments indicaticate as well presence
of non-condesed pairs well above critical temperature that results in drop in spins susceptibility [9].

.

this diverges as the stiness falls below

tkt =

j.

(47)

(48)

a more detailed study shows that this is an exact result for a very dilute system of vortices and antivortices.

in three dimensional system with a similar hamiltonian we have transition of 3d xy model to the state with proper

long-range order at temperature tc  3j 2/3

3d [11].

the result (44) for d = 2 renders the following form of the kinetic term for the chiral gross-neveu model:

hkin = z dx

n
16

m (t ) tanh(cid:18) m (t )

2t (cid:19) []2

(49)

one can observe that at temperature t  when gap modulus vanishes stifness of phase uctions disappears as well.
in contrast to ordinary xy-model in order to study phase transition in the system with the above hamiltonian we
should solve a set of equations for tkt (m, n ) and m (tkt , n ).

1. kosterlitz-thouless transition at low n

let us rst consider case of low n.
from expressions (49), (48), (38), (40) we see that that in the regime of low n tkt << t  at these temperatures

asymtotic expression for the stiness (49) reads 3:

thus kosterlitz-thouless transition will take place at temperature:

hkin = z dx

n
16

m (0)[]2

tkt =

n
32

m (0)

(50)

(51)

which at low n is essentilay lower than temperature t  = m(0)
(38). for the ratio tkt /t  at low n we obtain:

2 log 2 at which gap modulus disapearens of the gap modulus

tkt
t  =

n log(2)

16

(52)

so with decreasing n separation of tkt and t  increases.

2. kosterlitz-thouless transition at large n. restoration of mean-eld scenario.

lets us now turn to the regime when n is no longer low. then from the expressions (49), (48), (38), (39) we see

that that in this regime tkt tends from below to t  and thus hamiltonian (49) in this limit reads:

hkin = z dx

n
32

m (t )2

t

[]2

from (53), (48), (38), (39) follows the following equation for behavior of t  and tkt with incresing n:

tkt = t 

1

4

n log(2)

1 +

 t (cid:18)1 

4

n log(2)(cid:19) .

(53)

(54)

3one can observe from (40) that in this regime temperature corrections to the phase stifness are exponentialy suppressed

8

or for the ratio of tkt and t  we can write (compare with (52)):

tkt

t   (cid:18)1 

4

n log(2)(cid:19) .

(55)

this expression show how in the limit of high n temperature of the kosterlitz-thouless transition tends to temperature
of the gap formation and merges with it in the limit n   thus recovering mean-eld bevavior for transition into
the quasiordered state.

v. conclusion

in this paper we argue that in analogy to strong-coupling superconductivity chiral gross-neveu model at low n
posseses two characteristic temperatures tc and t  > tc.
in higher than two dimensions at some characteristic
temperture t  forms modulus of the complex gap function ||ei(x):
< || >6= 0 although phase is random so
average of the complex order parameter is zero: < ||ei(x) >= 0, temperature should be lowered to tc in order to
estabilish long-range order. similar discussion holds in two dimentions where we have as well three phases at low n:

 t > t  - high temperature chiraly symmetric phase with zero local gap.

 t  > t > tkt - chiraly simmetric phase with nonzero complex gap modulus and random phase.

 tkt > t low temperature quasi-ordered phase with bound vortex-antivortex pairs.

in the large-n regime tkt tends from below to t  and merges with it in the limit n   thus recovering

mean-eld scenario.

the described situation is similar to strong-coupling or low carrier density bevavior of a superconductor in two and
three dimensions in which case the region where pairs are formed but not condensed is called pseudogap phase (see [3]
and references therein) and is observed experimentaly [9]. similar situation was found as well in our previous paper
on condesate depletion by quantum uctuations in the chiral gross-neveu model in 2 +  dimensions and low n.

it should be noted that similar behavior is known in condensed matter physics in ferroelectrics and magnets
where one can as well distinguish two characteristic temperatures, for example in the latter case curie- and stoner-
temperatures.

the author is grateful to prof. a.j. niemi for many useful discussions.
