abstract

1 introduction

calculations of correlation functions in type iib supergravity on ads5s5 have been performed
extensively. these calculations study the strong coupling dynamics of n = 4 su(n) yang-
mills theory for large n as a result of the ads/cft correspondence conjectured in [1, 2, 3].
for calculations of 4-point functions, bulk to bulk greens functions, describing propagation
between two points in the interior of ads, are required. propagators for scalar elds have been
discussed in [4], and propagators for massless and massive gauge bosons were obtained in [5].
in [6], a new method for calculation of these propagators was discussed in which ansatze for
the bi-tensor propagators were used which naturally separated the gauge invariant parts from the
gauge artifacts. the gauge artifacts did not contribute if sources of the elds were conserved
currents. thus gauge xing was unnecessary.

in this paper, we use the same method as in [6] but now for massive p-forms and the massive
symmetric tensor elds. since the elds are massive, there is no gauge invariance which guar-
antees that the sources are conserved. however, as we will see, using a similar ansatze for the

1

p-forms (writing the propagator as a physical part and a pure gauge) in the massive case consid-
erably simplies the calculations. the pure gauge part is annihilated by the maxwell operator
and just appears multiplying m2 in the equation of motion. for the massive symmetric tensor,
the pure gauge part of the ansatz corresponds to diffeomorphisms at z (where the propagator
describes propagation from z to w). however, for our propagator to have symmetry under the
exchange z  w, we need to add a term which corresponds to diffeomorphisms with at w. this
term will not be annihilated by the wave operator. however, writing the propagator in this
form still simplies the calculation considerably.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we discuss the massless 2-form case as a
warm-up exercise (this case was discussed in [8]). we also nd the propagators for the massive
anti-symmetric tensor. we generalize the calculation of section 2 to p-forms in section 3. in
section 4, we perform the calculation for the propagator of the massive symmetric tensor. in
section 5, we check the short-distance limit of our results and nd that they match with the short
distance limit of the corresponding propagator in at space. we end with a summary of our
results in section 6.

we will work in euclidean adsd+1, which can be regarded as an upper half space z0 > 0 in

a space with coordinates z0, z1 . . . zd, and metric,

ds2 =

1
z2
0

(dz2

0 +

d

xi=1

dz2

i ).

(1.1)

the adsd+1 scale has been set to unity and the metric describes a space with a constant negative
curvature r = d(d + 1). we will introduce a chordal distance u in terms of which invariant
functions and tensors on adsd+1 can be expressed most simply:

(z  w)2
2z0w0

,

u 

(1.2)

where (z  w)2 = (z  w)(z  w) is the at euclidean distance. we will construct basic
bi-tensors by taking derivatives with respect z or w of the bi-scalar variable u. these are given
by 1

[(z  w)/w0  u0],
[(w  z) /z0  u 0] .

we will need certain properties of derivatives of u, most of which were derived in [7] and which
we list here.

2u = du = (d + 1)(1 + u),
du u = u(2 + u),

du = g(1 + u),
(du) (d u) = u u,
(du) ( u) = (1 + u) u,
(du) ( u) = g  + u u,

d u = g u.

2 antisymmetric tensor

the equation of motion for an anti-symmetric tensor eld in adsd+1 is

d[a]  m2a = j.

(1.5)

(1.6)

(1.7)

(1.8)

(1.9)

(1.10)

(1.11)

(2.1)

the covariant derivative is with respect to the ads metric. the maxwell operator is normalized
such that 2a appears with coefcient 1 in the equation of motion. we look for solutions of
the form

a = z dd+1wgg

 

(z, w)j (w),

(2.2)

with bi-tensor propagator g
equation for the propagator g

 (z, w)2:

 (z, w). using this expression for a in eq(2.1), we obtain an

(z, w) = (z, w)(g

).

(2.3)

m = 0

we will rst look at the case m = 0.
in this case, there is a gauge invariance of the form
a  a +    which implies that the current j  is conserved. the equation for
g

 (z, w) is:

,

(2.4)

where the second term on the right hand side gives zero when integrated with conserved currents.
we will introduce two bi-tensors,

 

= (
t
s;  = (

u 
uu 

u   
u   

u
u),
uu

u  

uu 

u +  

uu

u).(2.6)

(2.5)

these are the only two bi-tensors which are anti-symmetric under    and    . we will
choose the following ansatz for g

 (z, w):

 

g

(z, w) = t

 

f (u) + l

 

 l

 

.

the second term is a pure gauge and is annihilated by the maxwell operator:

[g]

 

 

= t[
= ([ 

]f (u)
u

u]u  [

u 

u]u)f (u).

in eq(2.4), we need an expression for d[g]

 :

d[g]

 

 

= d(t[
= ( 

u)

]f (u))
u]uf (u) + [ 

u(d

u)]uf (u)

u

+[ 
   .

u(d]u)f (u) + [ 

u

u]uduf (u)

(2.7)

various terms in eq(2.7) are simplied using properties of derivatives of u (eqs 1.5-1.11):

(d[ 

u)

u]uf (u) = ( 

u

[ 

u(d

[ 

u)]uf (u) = (
u

u(d]u)f (u) = t

u)(d  1)f (u),

uu 

(d  1)(1 + u)f (u),
f   (1 + u)s

 

 

f (u).

[ 

u

u]uduf (u) = u(2 + u)t

collecting all the terms together,

d[g]

 

= 2(cid:16)u(2 + u)f  + (d  1)(1 + u)f (cid:17)t

2(cid:16)(d  1)f  + (1 + u)f (cid:17)s

 

.

 

using ads invariance and the fact that ; is anti-symmetric in  and , 
the form:





= (

uu  

uu)(u),

4

(2.8)

 has to be of

(2.9)

where  is a scalar function of u. then,
 



 





 

= 2t

 

+ s

 

.

using these expressions, eq(2.4) becomes (for z and w separate)

(cid:16)u(2 + u)f  + (d  1)(1 + u)f  + 2(cid:17)t
(cid:16)(d  1)f  + (1 + u)f   (cid:17)s

 

= 0.

 

setting the scalar coefcients of the two independent tensors to zero, we obtain

u(2 + u)f  + (d  1)(1 + u)f  = 2,

(1 + u)f  + (d  1)f  = .

eq (2.11) can be integrated to give3

which can be substituted into (2.10):

 = (d  2)f + (1 + u)f ,

u(2 + u)f  + (d + 1)(1 + u)f  + 2(d  2)f = 0.

this is just the invariant equation

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)
for the propagator of a scalar eld of 2 = 2(d 2). a scalar eld of mass m2 is characterized
by two possible scale dimensions,

(2  2)f (u) = 0

 =

d
2 

1

2qd2 + 42.

(2.15)

for our propagator to have the fastest fall off as u  , in the following solution, we will
choose  = +.

d
f (u) = c(2u1)f (,  
2
2 + 1
2)
c =

()(  d
(4)(d+1)/2(2  d + 1)

4  2(d  2),

 =

1
2

; 2  d + 1;2u1),

(2.16)

,

(2.17)

where f is the standard hypergeometric function 2f1. the constant c is chosen such that as
u  0, f (u) matches on to the at space case (this is discussed in more detail in section 6).
3we consistently ignore constants of integration since we want our propagators to go to zero as u  .

5

m 6= 0
we will now consider the massive case. in this case, there is no gauge invariance and the current
j  is not necessarily conserved. we will still use the same ansatz,

 

g

= f (u)t

 

+ (l

 

 l

 

).

using ads invariance, we can write l;  as

 

l

= (

u 

u   

u

u)l(u),

(2.18)

(2.19)

where l(u) is a scalar function. d[g];  is still given by eq(2.8) since the maxwell
operator annihilates the second term in eq(2.18). this term is

 

l

 l

 

= 2lt

 

+ ls

 

.

(2.20)

eq(2.3) then becomes (for z and w separate)

(cid:16)u(2 + u)f  + (d  1)(1 + u)f (cid:17)t;  (cid:16)(d  1)f  + (1 + u)f (cid:17)s; 
m2f t;   m2(2lt;  + ls; ) = 0.

setting the coefcient of independent tensors to zero, we get a system of two coupled differential
equations:

u(2 + u)f  + (d  1)(1 + u)f   m2f  2m2l = 0,

 (d  1)f   (1 + u)f   m2l = 0.

eq(2.22) can be readily integrated to give

l = 

1
m2 ((d  2)f + (1 + u)f ).

substituting in eq(2.21), we nd an uncoupled differential equation for f (u)

u(2 + u)f  + (d + 1)(1 + u)f  + (m2 + 2(d  2))f = 0.

this is again the invariant equation

for the propagator of a scalar eld of 2 = (m2  2(d  2)).

(2  2)f (u) = 0

3 p-forms

the preceding calculation of the propagator of an anti-symmetric tensor can be generalized to
p-form propagators. the equations of motion for a p-form eld is

1

d[a12...p]  m2a12...p = 0.

which implies

u(2 + u)f  + (d + 1  p)f   m2f  pm2l = 0,

(1 + u)f  + (d + 1  p)f  + m2l = 0.

eq(3.10) can be integrated to give

l = 

1

which can then be substituted in eq(3.9):

m2(cid:16)(d  p)f + (1 + u)f (cid:17),



= 0,

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

u(2 + u)f  + (d + 1)f  +(cid:16)m2 + p(d  p)(cid:17)f = 0.

this is the equation for the propagator of the scalar eld of 2 = m2  p(d  p). the solution
to this equation is given by eq(2.16) with

 =

d
2

+

1

2qd2 + 4m2  4p(d  p).

this result agrees with [9] for the case m = 0.

4 massive symmetric tensor

we will begin by reviewing the equations of motion for the massless graviton. the propagator
for the graviton was obtained in [6]. the gravitational action is

ig =

1

22 z dd+1zg(r  ) + sm,

8

(4.1)

where sm is the matter action. the equations of motion are

r 

1
2

g(r  ) = t.

(4.2)

t is the stress-energy tensor. for  = d(d  1) and t = 0, we obtain euclidean ads
space with r = d(d + 1). in the presence of a matter source, the metric will no longer be the
ads metric g. we will denote the uctuations about g by h. an equivalent form of the
equation is

the linearized equations of motion for h are

r + dg = t  t 

1
d  1

gt

.

(4.3)

 ddh  ddh

 + ddh + ddh  2(h  gh

) = 2 t.

(4.4)

all covariant derivatives and contractions are with respect to g.

for the case of massive symmetric tensor, s, a consistent action with coupling to gravity
is not known. for example, consider a kaluza-klein reduction of a theory of gravity in d
dimensional space-time to d  1 dimensional space time. we get an innite tower of massive
symmetric tensor elds in d  1 dimensions.
it was shown in [10] that it is impossible to
consistently truncate this theory to a nite number of symmetric tensor elds. however, the
quadratic part of the action (which is what we need for calculation of the propagator) was given
in [11] [12].

(4.5)
. we work with arbitrary m1 and m2 and only

1s +m2

we look for solutions of the form

s(z) = z dd+1wgg; (z, w)j  

(w),

(4.6)

where g; (z, w)is the bi-tensor propagator for the massive symmetric tensor. inserting this
expression in eq(4.5), we obtain the equation



 ddg;   ddg
+ ddg;   2(g;   gg
= (cid:16)gg  + g g 

2
d  1

  + ddg; 
; ) + m2



gg (cid:17)(z, w).

1g;  + m2

2gg

(4.7)



; 

the next step is to write g; (z, w) in terms of invariant bi-tensors in adsd+1 and scalar
functions. we will use the following ve bi-tensors dened in [6]:

t (1)
;  = g g ,
t (2)
;  = u u u  u,
t (3)
;  = u  u +  u u,
t (4)
;  = g u  u + g  u u,
t (5)
;  = u u u + u u u + (   ).

(4.8)

our ansatz for the propagator g; (z, w) is

g;  = (u  u +  u u) g(u) + gg  h(u)

+dl;  + dl;  + d;  + d ;,

where

and

;  = g ua(u) + u uuc(u) + (u u +  uu)b(u)

;  = g ua(u) + uu uc(u) + ( uu +  uu)b(u),

(4.9)

(4.10)

dl;  + dl;  = 2(1 + u)at (1) + g uu2a + 2c t (2) + 2bt (3) + ct (5)

+ gu u(2(1 + u)c + 4b) + b t (5),

(4.11)

d;  + d ; = 2(1 + u)at (1) + gu u2a + 2c t (2) + 2bt (3) + ct (5)

+ g uu(2(1 + u)c + 4b) + b t (5).

(4.12)

10

this ansatz is invariant under exchange z  w (exchange of primed and unprimed indices). we
note that

d;  + d ; = dl;  + dl;  +(cid:16)2a + 2(1 + u)c + 4b(cid:17)g uu

 (cid:16)2a + 2(1 + u)c + 4b(cid:17)gu u.

the term dl;  + dl;  just corresponds to diffeomorphisms in z and is annihilated by
the wave operator. unlike the massless graviton case, all ve functions g(u), h(u), a(u),
b(u) and c(u) are physical. we now nd the differential equations for these ve functions.
using this ansatz in (4.7) and using relations in eq(1.5-1.11), it is simple, but tedious to derive
the following equation:

(4.14)

obtain the following system of six differential equations:

this is an over determined system since we have six equations for ve functions which can be
traced to the fact that eq(4.5) does not possess the symmetry under exchange of z and w which
the propagator itself possesses. so we will have to check that one of the above equations is
redundant.

eq(4.16) can be integrated to give

(d  1)f  = 2g  4m2

1c,

(4.21)

in this and all that follows, we will consistently drop integration constants since we want our
solution to approach 0 as u  . we can integrate eq(4.21) to obtain

where

(d  1)f = 2g  4m2

1d,

c = d.

eq(4.22) can then be substituted in eq(4.20) to obtain

eq(4.17), can be brought into the following form using eq(4.22) and eq(4.24):

4this relation between m1 and m2 was discussed after eq(4.5).
5actually, the expression for d in eq(4.29) is a solution to eq(4.29) for any m1 and m2. it is the unique solution

for m1 = (d  1)m2

from eq(4.23), we can get an expression for c(u):

f =

using the denition of f (eq(4.14)) and expressions for b and d, we obtain

we still need to check that eq(4.15) is redundant. using eqs(4.21,4.24,4.37,4.23), we can
rewrite eq(4.15) in terms of g(u) and d(u) and their derivatives. then, using eq(4.25) and
eq(4.29) and integrated versions of these equations, it is tedious but straight forward to show
that the left hand side is identically zero.

5 u  0

in this section, we will check the u  0 limit of the propagators for the massive vector and
massive symmetric tensor in adsd+1. we have set the ads scale r (the radius of curvature) to
unity. had not set r to unity and taken the limit r   in our propagators, we should naively
recover the at space results. this is almost true; since m in the ads space is measured in units
r, to match to the at space propagator of a non-zero mass, we also have to take m  . so
of 1
if we take the u  0 and m   the propagators should approach the short distance limit of
the corresponding propagators in at space.

for comparison with the at space propagators, it is convenient to re-write the adsd+1 prop-

agators in terms of n and n where

n(z, w) = d(z, w), n(z, w) = d(z, w),

(z, w) is the geodesic distance between z and w and g
w. we will also need the following dictionary [6]

  is the parallel transporter from z to

u = cosh()  1,

n =
qu(u + 2)

g  =  u +

.

(5.1)

5.1 massive vector

for the massive vector, the propagator we obtained in adsd+1 is (specializing the case of p-forms
in section 3 to p = 1):

g(z, w) = (f + l)u + luu.

(5.2)

in terms of n and n, we can re-write g(z, w) as

as u  0,

g(z, w) = (f + l)g (cid:16)u(2 + u)l  u(f + l)(cid:17)nn.

g(z, w) =

where f is just the leading term of f as u  01.

n is the leading term in n(r2) as r2  03 . also for small u, u  2

2 = r2

2 (from eq(5.1)).

the normalization of f (u) in eq(5.2) was chosen such that it matches with n(r2) as u  0,

i.e.

f (u) = n (r2) = n (2u).

in terms of u, as u  0,

(5.5)

which is exactly the same as the short distance limit in eq(5.3).

5.2 massive symmetric tensor

as u  0, g; (z, w) for the massive symmetric tensor should approach the short-distance
limit of the massive symmetric tensor propagator in at space. to check this, it is convenient
re-write our expression for g; (z, w) in terms of tensors ois dened in [6]:

o(1)
  = gg ,
o(2)
  = nnnn ,
o(3)
  = gg  + g g,
o(4)
  = gnn  + g nn,
o(5)
  = gnn  + g nn + g nn + gnn  .

2n (r2) denotes

rd1

16

we can write the tensors ti dened earlier in terms of oi by using eq(5.1):

t (1) = o(1),
t (2) = [u(u + 2)]2o(2) ,
t (3) = 2u2o(2) + o(3)  uo(5) ,
t (4) = u(u + 2)o(4) ,
t (5) = 4u2(u + 2)o(2)  u(u + 2)o(5) .

g; (z, w) can be written in terms of o(i):
g; (z, w) = (cid:16)h + 4(1 + u)a(cid:17)o(1) +(cid:16)g + 4b(cid:17)o(3)
+ (cid:16)4u2(u + 2)2c  + 2u2g + 8u2b + 8u2(u + 2)c + 8u2(u + 2)b (cid:17)o(2)
+ (cid:16)2a + 2(1 + u)c + 4b(cid:17)u(2 + u)o(4)
 (cid:16)(g + 4b)u + (2c + 2b )u(2 + u)(cid:17)o(5) .

we now take the u  0 and m   limit:

g; (z, w) =

1

2dm4h4(d  1)g o1 + 4(d  1)g o3 + 16(d  1)u2g o2

+ 8(d  1)ug o4  8(d  1)ug o5i .

here, g is the leading term in g(u) as u  04.

in at euclidean space, the propagator for the massive symmetric tensor is calculated in the

appendix. the short distance limit of the at space propagator is given by the expression:

gf lat

; (x, y) =

8(d  1)

m4d

8(d  1)
m4d n o(3)

where n is, as before, the leading term in n(r2). g(u) was normalized in eq(4.26) such that

as u = r2

g(u) = n (r2) = n (2u) ,
2  0. then, in terms of u, we can write eq(5.7) as
gf lat

; (z, w) =

d3

this exactly matches the short distance limit of the propagator in adsd+1 in eq(5.7).
