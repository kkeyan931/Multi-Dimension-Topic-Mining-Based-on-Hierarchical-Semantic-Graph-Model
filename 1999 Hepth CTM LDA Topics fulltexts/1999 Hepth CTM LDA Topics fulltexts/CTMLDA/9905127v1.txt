it has been conjectured that the abelian projection of qcd is responsible for the connement of
color. we present a theoretical proof of the abelian dominance. in specic we prove that the gauge
eld conguration which contributes to the wilson loop integral is precisely the gauge covariant
part of the restricted potential, restricted by the abelian projection. the gauge covariance of this
potential naturally allows a dynamical generation of the mass scale (the connement scale), which
guarantees the dual meissner eect and the color connement in qcd.

the connement problem in qcd is perhaps one of
the most dicult problems in theoretical physics.
it
has long been argued that the monopole condensation
could provide the connement of the color through a dual
meissner eect [1,2]. more explicitly it has been conjec-
tured that the restricted part of qcd which comes from
the abelian projection of the theory to its maximal
abelian subgroup is responsible for the dynamics of the
dual meissner eect [2,3]. this conjecture, which asserts
that in non-abelian gauge theory only the degrees which
correspond to its maximal abelian subgroup should play
the important role in the infra-red limit of the theory,
is generally known as the abelian dominance, and has
been addressed by many authors in the literature [4,5].
but the actual proof of the abelian dominance and the
monopole condensation in the low energy limit of qcd
has remained dicult.

a simple criterion for the connement is given by the
wilson loop:
if the vacuum expectation value of the
wilson loop satises the area law for a large current
loop of a colored object, the connement could be as-
sured. this suggests that the abelian dominance could
be tested through the wilson loop calculation. in this
direction, a remarkable progress has been made by the
numerical simulation during the last decade. in fact, the
lattice calculation has conrmed the abelian dominance
and showed that the dominant contribution to the string
tension in qcd (actually 92%) comes from the abelian
projection of the theory [6,7]. if this is so, one should
be able to prove the abelian dominance theoretically,
independent of the numerical simulation. the purpose
of this letter is to provide a theoretical proof of the
abelian dominance in the wilson loop calculation.
in
specic we prove that it is the abelian projection of the
full connection, more precisely the gauge covariant part
of the abelian projection, which contributes to the wil-
son loop integral. furthermore we show that the wilson
loop integral can be expressed as the generating functional

of the restricted qcd which describes the dual dynamics
of the non-abelian gauge theory. this strongly endorses
the magnetic condensation and dual meissner eect as
the dynamical mechanism for the connement of color in
qcd.

consider a non-abelian gauge theory of a given gauge

group g,

l = 

1
4

~f 2

 ,

(1)

where ~f is the eld strength. to prove the abelian
dominance in the infra-red limit, one must rst know how
to project out and separate the connection which corre-
sponds to the maximal abelian subgroup h from the full
non-abelian connection of the group g. for su (2) this
means that one should project out the u (1) component of
the connection in a gauge-independent way. to do this,
one must rst select the u (1) direction at each space-
time point, and make a gauge-independent projection of
the connection which corresponds to the u (1) degree.
this can be done by introducing a unit iso-triplet scalar
eld n(x) which transforms covariantly under the gauge
transformation, and insisting that n remains unchanged
under the parallel transport [2]. so we require n to be a
covariant constant,

d n = 0 (n2 = 1).

(2)

clearly n selects the u (1) direction at each space-time
point, and the parallel transport (2) provides the desired
abelian projection of the full connection ~a,

~a  a = a n 

1
g

n   n,

(3)

where a = n  ~a is the naive abelian component
(the electric potential) of the connection. this a is
the restricted connection we introduced some time ago

1

[2,3].
it has many interesting features. first, n being
gauge covariant, the projection (3) is obviously gauge-
independent. moreover, a retains the full su (2) gauge
degrees of freedom even though it is clearly restricted.
this is because the gauge-independent projection still
makes it an su (2) connection. indeed, under an arbi-
trary gauge transformation specied by an innitesimal
parameter ~, one has

n = ~  n,  ~a =

d

~,

1
g

which guarantees

 a =

d~ =

1
g

1
g

(~ + g a  ~).

(4)

(5)

more importantly, a retains the full topological charac-
teristics of the original non-abelian potential. in fact, the
isolated singularities of n denes 2(s2) which describes
the non-abelian monopoles [2,8]. indeed a with a = 0
and n = r describes precisely the wu-yang monopole [9].
besides, with the s3 compactication of r3, n denes the
hopf invariant 3(s2) which describes the topologically
distinct vacuua [10].

the above discussion implies that there exists a sub-
class of the non-abelian gauge theory, the restricted
gauge theory, which contains only the abelian projection
which nevertheless has the full no-abelian gauge degrees
of freedom [2,3]. to understand this, notice that with
the abelian projection (3) one has

f = (f + h)n,
f = a   a,

h = 

1
g

n  ( n   n) = c  c,

(6)

where the last equality follows from  h = 0 (except
for the isolated singularities of n). to nd the potential
c let

s = exp (t3) exp (t2) exp (t1),

where ti are the adjoint representation of the su (2) gen-
erators, and let

ni = s1ei

(i = 1, 2, 3),

(7)

where e1 = (1, 0, 0), e2 = (0, 1, 0), and e3 = (0, 0, 1).
now we identify n to be n3,

c =

1
g

(cos  + )

= 

1
g

n1   n2.

(10)

this shows that c describes precisely the diracs
monopole potential around the isolated singularities of n.
so the restricted gauge theory describes the dual dynam-
ics of the color charge and the non-abelian monopole.

with the abelian projection it is easy to obtain the
full connection ~a. since the connection space forms
an ane space, one can obtain an arbitrary non-abelian
connection ~a simply by adding a gauge-covariant vector
eld ~x to ~a,

~a = a n 

1
g

n  n + ~x = a + ~x.

(11)

notice that ~x must be orthogonal to n. from (4) and
(5) one can easily conrm that ~x indeed forms a covari-
ant multiplet,

 ~x = ~  ~x.

(12)

with (11) one has

~f = d ~x  d ~x + (f + h + x)n,

(13)

where x = gn  ( ~x  ~x ). furthermore with

~x = x 1

 n1 + x 2

 n2,

one has

d ~x = [x 1
+ [x 2

  g(a + c)x 2
 + g(a + c)x 1

 ]n1
 ]n2.

(14)

so one could express the lagrangian explicitly in terms
of a, n, and ~x,

l =

(f + h + x )2

| d ~x  d ~x|2.

(15)

clearly this describes a u (1) gauge theory coupled to a
charged vector eld ~x. but the important point here is
that the u (1) potential is given by (a + c), not a.
the corresponding equations of motion is given by

(f + h + x ) = gn  ~x  ( d ~x  d ~x),

n = n3 = (sin  cos , sin  sin , cos ).

(8)

d( d ~x  d ~x) = g(f + h

then under the gauge transformation s, one has

+ x)n  x.

(16)

a  (a + c)e3,
f  (f + h )e3,

where

this allows us to interpret ~x as the valence gluon
which plays the role of a colored source of the restricted
theory [2,3]. more importantly this implies that ~x, just
like the quarks, could play only a minor role (if at all) in

(9)

2

the connement mechanism. it represents simply another
colored source which has to be conned itself. this is the
reason why only the restricted connection (3) should play
the dominant role in the wilson loop calculation.

notice that under the inverse gauge transformation

s1 which rotates e3 to n, one must have

a = (a + c)n +

1
g

tr(

~ts1s)

= a n

g

n   n.

(17)

more importantly under the gauge transformation (3)
one has

(a + c) = (n  ~a) 

1
g

(n1   n2)

= 0.

(18)

this shows that (a + c)n is the gauge covariant part
of the restricted connection. this in turn allows us to
identify the gauge covariant part ~a(c)
 of the full connec-
tion,

~a = (a + c)n + ~x +

1
g

tr(

~ts1s)

= ~a(c)

~ts1s).

(19)

where

this observation will become important in the wilson
loop calculation.

now we are ready to discuss wilson loop along a closed
curve c. the wilson loop integral, although conception-
ally simple, has remained very dicult to carry out. but
an important step to simplify the integral was made by
diakonov and petrov, who showed that integral can be
expressed as a functional integral over all gauge transfor-
mations s(t) along the loop [11],

w (c) = trp exp [i adx]

= z ds(t) exp [

1

2 i trt3(sas1

(20)

+

g

ss1)dx],

where a = ~a  ~t. now from (19) we have

2

tr [ t3(sas1 +

g

ss1)]

= 

1
2

tr[s1t3s(a 

1
g

s1s)]

= n  ~a(c)
= a + c.



(21)

this makes us to identify the gauge eld conguration
which is relevant to the wilson loop integral. it is indeed

the restricted gauge potential, more precisely the gauge
invariant part of the restricted potential, that contributes
to the wilson loop integral. this proves the abelian dom-
inance, which conrms the conjecture that the dynamics
of the restricted gauge theory (or the dual gauge theory)
is responsible for the color connement in qcd.

with (21) we can now obtain the desired expression

for the wilson loop,

< w (c) > = z dadnd ~x exp[
+i (a + c)dx].

4 z ~f 2

 d4x

(22)

by integrating out the ~x degrees of freedom, one can
express the integral as the vacuum average of (20) over
the eective lagrangian le of the restricted qcd,
< w (c) > = z dadn exp[z le d4x

+i (a + c)dx]

= z dadn exp{z [ le

+ (a + c)j]d4x},

(23)

j = z 4(x  z(t))

dt.

on the other hand, since the integral (20) does not con-
tain ~x, one might as well use the lagrangian for the
restricted theory in the integral (22), putting ~x = 0
and skipping the ~x integral. so one may write
< w (c) > = z dadn exp{z [
+ (a + c)j]d4x}
= z dadc exp{z [
+ (a + c)j]d4x},

where we have changed the variable n by c (it is un-
derstood that dc includes the jacobian for the change
of variable). this shows that one can reduce the evalua-
tion of the wilson loop integral to the evaluation of the
generating functional of the restricted gauge theory for
the gauge invariant external current j. this is really
remarkable, but perhaps not so surprising. it has been
known that the evaluation of the wilson loop integral
could be related to the evaluation of a gauge invariant
part of the generating functional which is invariant under
the gauge transformation of the external current ~j [11].
our result not only conrms this but more importantly
drastically simplies the integral, which is made possible

a more detailed discussion, including the derivation of
the eective lagrangian for the restricted gauge theory
and the generalization to an arbitrary group g, will be
given in a forthcoming paper [13].

by identifying the eld conguration which contributes
to the wilson loop.

the physics behind our main result (24) is unmistak-
able. clearly the electric potential a generates the usual
coulomb potential. but the magnetic potential c, with
the magnetic condensation of the vacuum < h 2
 >6= 0,
should generate the linear potential which connes the
color. the important point here is the mechanism of
the dynamical symmetry breaking and the generation of
the connement scale.
in our formulation the symme-
try breaking is guaranteed by (18). notice that a and
c separately enjoys the gauge symmetry of the maximal
abelian subgroup h, but a + c together no longer has
the symmetry. with the disappearance of the u (1) sym-
metry a +c must acquire a mass through the quantum
correction, which in turn triggers the dual meissner ef-
fect.

we close with the following remarks:
1) it must be emphasized that our denition of the
abelian projection is dierent from the conventional one,
although the underlying physics behind it is the same. in
the popular denition of t hooft, the abelian projection
is regarded as a partial gauge xing (called the maximal
abelian gauge) of g/h degrees [4,5]. in our approach the
abelian projection (3) is obviously gauge independent, so
that after the projection the restricted potential enjoys
the full gauge degrees of freedom.

2) we have shown that the valence part of the potential
~x does not contribute to the wilson loop. physically
this is because it represents a colored source which has to
be conned itself. there is another physical reason why
it can be neglected in the infra-red limit. as a gauge
covariant multiplet it must acquire a mass through the
quantum correction. so in the low energy limit it could
be treated as a heavy non-propagating source, and safely
be neglected. this mass generation does not require any
symmetry breaking, however, and should not be confused
with the mass generation of the dual potential which gen-
erates the dynamical symmetry breaking of the abelian
subgroup h.

3) it must be clear that it is the topological degree of
n (described by c) which is responsible for the conne-
ment. in the wilson loop integral this topological degree
is naturally (and rightfully) included in the fuctional inte-
gral, but it must be emphasized that at the classical level
n can not be treated as a dynamical (i.e., propagating)
eld. this is because one can always remove n with the
gauge transformation s, at least locally. in this connec-
tion faddeev and niemi has recently made an interesting
ansatz, ~x = f1 n + f2n  n, and conjectured that n
should be counted as a dynamical degree in the infra-red
limit [12]. but notice that this ansatz, although clearly
consistent, does not describe the most general connec-
tion. in fact this ansatz does not make n dynamical at
the classical level. it becomes dynamical in the eective
