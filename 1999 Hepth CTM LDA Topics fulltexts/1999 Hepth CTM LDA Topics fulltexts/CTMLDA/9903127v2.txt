abstract

we study and discuss some of the consequences of the inclusion of
torsion in 3d einstein-chern-simons gravity. torsion may trigger the
excitation of non-physical modes in the spectrum. higher-derivative
terms are then added up and tree-level unitarity is contemplated.

introduction

the concept of torsion as the antisymmetric part of the ane conection was
introduced by cartan, in 1922. he recognized that torsion should be the ge-
ometrical object related to the intrinsic angular momentum of matter, and
later, with the concept of spin, it was suggested that torsion should mediate a
contact interaction between spinning particles without however propagating
in matter-free space [1, 2]. after that, a number of authors reassessed the re-
lation between torsion and spin in an attempt to formulate general relativity
as a gauge theory, with the motivation that, at a microscopic level, particles
are classied by their mass and spin, according to the poincare group [3, 4].
in fact, torsion can be minimally coupled to matter elds: the requirement
that the dirac equation in a gravitational eld preserve local invariance un-
der lorentz transformations yields a direct interaction between torsion and
fermions. the observational consequences of a propagating torsion and its
interactions with matter have been reported in [5, 6, 7].

another important reason to consider torsion in gravity theory concerns
the discussion of unitarity and renormalizability for the linearized version of
the theory. it is well-known that, although standard einstein gravity in four-
dimensional space-time seems satisfactory as a classical theory, its quantum
formulation presents a serious drawback: the non-renormalizability problem.
in order to circumvent this undesirable aspect, several modications in the
theory have been proposed, such as the insertion of higher-derivative terms,
which generally leads to a non-unitary theory. in this context, there appears
string theory as the main promising framework to overcome the problems of
quantum gravity. as a matter of fact, torsion is naturally incorporated in
the string formulation of gravity. it is generally suggested that the rank-3
antisymmetric eld of the low-energy eective lagrangian dictated by string
theory might be associated with torsion. furthermore, the spin-2 component
of the torsion eld may aect the graviton propagator and can therefore
modify the convergence properties of the theory.

on the other hand, the interest in discussing gravity in three-dimensional

1

space-time has been receiving a great deal of attention [8]. in spite of the
fact that planar einstein theory has no dynamical degrees of freedom, the
introduction of a 3d topologically massive term [9, 10] yields a dynamical
graviton and leads to a renormalizable model [11, 12, 13]. we believe that the
introduction of new degrees of freedom into this theory (here, those coming
from the torsion eld) could open some trend for a better understanding of
3d quantum gravity in its full potentiality: the metric and torsion quantum
uctuations mix up and lead to a rich mass spectrum. also, the power-
counting renormalizability may be improved once torsion is allowed, although
unitarity demands some extra care.

in this paper, we introduce torsion in the framework of topologically
massive gravity theory via the usual minimal  substitution, namely, by

replacing the christoel symbol, n 

o, by the cartan ane connection. in

the same way as in 4d gravity, the curvature scalar in 3d does not provide
any kinetic term for the torsion components, so that their eld equations
are purely algebraic. however, we see that dynamical contributions for the
torsion arise from the chern-simons term. the main purpose of our work is
to employ the spin-projection operator formalism to nd out the propagators
for the metric and torsion elds. in view of the results we attain, a ghost-free
3d gravity theory can be formulated once some constraints are imposed on
the parameters of the lagrangians we discuss [14, 15].

our work is organized as follows: in section 2, we provide a short review
on riemann-cartan space-time. 3d torsion is decomposed into its so(1,2)-
irreducible components. then, one presents the full lagrangian for the theory
in its linearized approximation. section 3 is devoted to the attainment of the
propagators for some specic classes of lagrangians and to the check of the
tree-level unitarity of the theory. our concluding comments are summarized
in section 4.

2 preliminaries

we propose to carry out our analysis of the propagating torsion by start-
ing o from the following action for topologically massive gravity in three

2

dimensions:

where

s =z d3xhg(a1r + a2r2 + a3rr) + a4lcsi ,

lcs =  

 ( 

 +

2
3

  
 
 )

(2.1)

(2.2)

is the topological chern-simons term. a1, a2 and a3 are free coecients,
whereas a4 is the parameter associated to chern-simons. one should no-
tice that the usual action for the cosmological constant and the so-called
translational chern-simons term [16] have not been included in (2.1).

note that in three dimensions terms proportional to rr are not
independent, due to the fact that the curvature tensor can be written in terms
of the ricci tensor (they have the same number of independent components).
we adopt here the minkowski metric  = (+;,) and the ricci tensor
r = r 
 .
let us consider riemann-cartan space-time, where the ane connection
is non-symmetric in the rst two indices and is no longer completely deter-
mined by the metric [1]. the antisymmetric part of the ane connection is
the torsion tensor:

t 
 = 2 

[] =  

   
 .

(2.3)

in this space-time, the coecients of the ane connection can be ex-

pressed in terms of the metric and torsion,

 

 =n 

o + k 

 ,

where n 

metric:

o is the christoel symbol, which is completely determined by the

and

g (g +  g  g) ,
 (cid:17)

is the contortion tensor, which is antisymmetric in the last two indices.

in 3d, the torsion with its 9 degrees of freedom can be covariantly split
into its so(1,2)-irreducible components: a trace part, t  t 
 , a totally
antisymmetric part,   t, and a traceless rank-2 symmetric tensor,

3

x. the splitting in the above components is realized according to the
following relation:

t =  +

1
2

(t  t) + x 

.

(2.7)

in order to read o the propagators and, consequently, the particle spectrum
of the theory, we linearize the metric-dependent part of the lagrangian by
adopting the weak gravitational eld approximation:

g(x) =  + h(x),

(2.8)

where  stands for the gravitational coupling constant in 3d. h represents
a small pertubation around at minkowski space-time.

the action is invariant under general coordinate transformations,

h(x) = (x) + (x),

(2.9)

where  is the gauge parameter. therefore, it is necessary to x this gauge
invariance in order to make the wave operator of the lagrangian non-singular.
this is achieved by adding the de donder gauge-xing term,

lgf =
f = (cid:18)h

h(cid:19) ,

(2.10)

(2.11)

where

with h  h 
behaves like a tensor under general coordinate transformations.

 . no other gauge-xing term is required, since the torsion eld

first, let us conne ourselves to the study of the topologically massive
gravity without the higher derivative terms r2 and rr (a2 = a3 = 0).
in this case, the action is the sum of einstein, chern-simons and gauge-xing
terms. so, by decomposing the torsion into its irreducible components (2.7),
and making use of the weak eld approximation for the metric, the bilinear
terms can be collected as below:

where a1 has dimension of mass, while the coecient of the topological term,

adopted in order to avoid tachyon and ghost modes in the spectrum.

3 the propagators

we now rewrite the linearized lagrangian (2.12) in a more convenient form,
namely

l =

1

2x

o,

(3.13)

where  = (h , x , t, ) and o is the wave operator. the propagators
are given by

h0| t [ (x)  (y)]|0i = i (o)1 3 (x  y) .

(3.14)

in order to invert the wave operator, we shall use an extension of the
spin-projection operator formalism introduced in [17, 18], where one needs
to add now other four new operators coming from the chern-simons and
torsion terms. the operators for rank-2 symmetric tensors in 3d are given
by:

where  and  are respectively the transverse and longitudinal projector
operators for vectors. the other four operators coming from the bilinear
terms are

s, = ( +  +  + ) ,
r, = ( +  +  + ) ,

(3.16)

a = ,
e, =  + ;

a, e and r appear exclusively due to the inclusion of torsion.

we now present the relations between the above spin-projector operators.
the products between the usual barnes-rivers operators in d=3 are given
by

p iap jb = ijabp jb,
p iabp jcd = ijbcp ja,
p iap jbc = ijabp jac,
p iabp jc = ijbcp jac,

(3.17)

and satisfy the following tensorial identity:

(cid:16)p (2) + p (1) + p (0s) + p (0w)(cid:17),

=

2

( + ) .

(3.18)

we list below some of the non-trivial relations involving the new projectors
(3.16):

(3.19)

ss = 16p (2),
rr = 4p (1),
sp (2) = s,
rp (1) = r.

6

thus, the wave operator can be decomposed in four sectors, namely

o =  m n

p q ! ,

(3.20)

where the blocks m, n, p and q are all 2  2-matrices. their non-trivial
elements, expanded in terms of the spin projection operators, are listed below:

before computing the inverse of the operator o, it is perhaps worthwhile
to discuss an interesting specic case. note that, as already remarked, the
massless einstein theory in three-dimensional space-time is not dynamical;
however, the introduction of the topological mass term leads to a dynamical
theory with a physical propagating massive spin-two particle (if we take
a1 > 0) [10]. in this context, we expect that the chern-simons term provides
dynamics for the torsion components too. then, let us now restrict the
analysis to the lagrangian of torsion in a at space-time background, in
order to get a rst idea on the behaviour of torsion components from the
point of view of the topological theory. eliminating the graviton terms (due
to our choice of a at space-time) yields the lagrangian density:

l =

+
+4x t  4x 

(32  tt + 2x x ) +
a4
(2t + tt +

 x).

(3.23)

here, one notices that the curvature scalar, r, provides only mass terms
for the elds, while the kinetic terms are all coming from the chern-simons
sector.

as there are no derivatives of the scalar eld, , in the lagrangian, its

equation of motion leads to

 = 

a4
6a1

t.

(3.24)

inserting (3.24) back into (3.23), one obtains a lagrangian written exclusively
in terms of t and x. using the spin-projector algebra, the propagators
are readily obtained. their explicit form in momentum space are as follows:

hxxi = i(

(3.26)

where we have suppressed the indices in the eld x and in the projectors
p,, s, and r,.

from the above results, we see that this theory contains a massive non-
tachyonic pole in the spin-2 sector of hx xi. on the other hand, (3.26)
shows that the t-eld describes only the propagation of a longitudinal tachy-
onic mode that does not couple to external conserved sources. the same
holds true for the mixed propagator hx ti, which we do not quote above.
the next step is to check the tree-level unitarity of the theory. this is
done by analysing the residues of the saturated propagator. the source with
which we are going to saturate the hx xi-propagator is compatible with

8

the symmetries of the theory and can be expanded in terms of a complete
basis as follows:

(p) = a(p)pp + b(p)p(
p +e(p)

+d(p)

p







p) +c(p)p() +
p( ) + f (p)(),



(3.27)







where p = (p0,

= (p0,

p ),

p



p ), and  = (0,



 ) are linearly independent



p

p= (p0)2 + (



p )2 6= 0,

p = 0,
 = 1.

(3.28)

(3.29)

(3.30)

the current-current transition amplitude in momentum space is the sat-

urated propagator

a =  (p) hx(p)x(p)i  (p).

(3.31)

due to the source constraint p  = 0, only the transverse projectors p (2),
p (0s) and s can give non-vanishing contributions to the amplitude. how-
ever, when we take the imaginary part of the residue of the amplitude at
, only the spin-2 sector of the propagator will

the massive pole, 2  (cid:16) a1
a4(cid:17)2

contribute. then, we obtain the following result:

i m(resa) = lim

(||2 

).

(3.32)

2

1

2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 
 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

for a massive pole, the analysis can be done in the rest frame. in this case

p = (, 0, 0) ,




= (, 0, 0) ,

p

 = (0,



 ).

thus, by expressing the sources in terms of this basis, (3.32) becomes

i m(resa) = 

1
4a1 |f|2 .

9

(3.33)

(3.34)

therefore, unlike the torsion-free theory, the sign of the einstein part must
be negative, namely

a1 = 

1
2

,

otherwise the massive mode would become ghost-like.

from the results (3.25) and (3.34), it follows that the lagrangian (3.23)
describes the propagation of a ghost-free and non-tachyonic torsion with spin-
2 and mass 2. in fact, as we shall see next, the spin-2 component of torsion
plays a central role here, in the sense that only this component can aect the
spin-2 sector of the graviton propagator.

we now turn back to invert the complete wave operator (3.20). the
procedure is straightforward, but tedious. we have chosen to invert the
sectors m and q, using the algebra of the projectors listed in (3.17-3.19).
afterwards, one must to invert (m  n q1p ) and (q  p m 1n). in so
doing, the propagators are classied in four sectors, namely

where

o1 =  x y

z w ! ,

x = (m  n q1p )1,
z = q1p x,
w = (q  p m 1n)1,
y = m 1n w,

or explicitly, in terms of matrix elements ix11 = hhhi , ix12 = hhxi , ...,
iw22 = hi. now, let us present the non-vanishing propagators in momen-

upon inspection of the poles of the propagators quoted above, we can

state the following results:

a4 (cid:17)2
(i) there appears an undesirable double pole at p2 = (cid:16) 2a1
located in
the spin-2 sector of the h  x propagators (we shall handle this situation
below);
3a4(cid:17)2
(ii) there is a massive mode at p2 = (cid:16) 2a1
h  x propagators;

in the spin-0 sector of the

(iii) a tachyonic pole shows up at p2 =  12a2

in the longitudinal sec-
tor, p (0w), of the x  t propagators (it does not however contribute to
the residue of the current-current amplitude whenever the sources are trans-
verse).

5a2

we now search for the constraints on the parameters of the theory that
follow from the requirement of having a positive-denite residue matrix at
the pole. using (3.37-3.39), one obtains the following residue of the saturated

propagator at the pole p2 =(cid:16) 2a1

where we have redened the x-eld, x

have the same dimension.  is the external current associated to the graviton
eld and  the one associated to the torsion. the above residue matrix has
one non-trivial positive eigenvalue (non-ghost) by choosing a1 < 0, which
corresponds to a physical spin-0 mode.

furthermore, we see that the inclusion of torsion into the einstein-chern-
simons theory, by replacing the christoel symbol by the cartan connection,
leads to a theory in which the spin-2 propagators contain second order poles,
and unitarity is consequently violated [19]. to overcome this undesirable sit-
uation, we propose the introduction of the following higher-derivative terms:

only the riemannian part of this tensor. the meaning of the last term will
become clear later.

a2r2 and a3rr , as well as the new coupling term, a5x fr , into
the original lagrangian, where the tilde in fr means that we are considering
conning ourselves, for simplicity, only to the h  x sector of the
lagrangian, since the other blocks do not aect the spin-2 sector of the
propagators, we can be concerned only with the inversion of the m-sector
of the wave operator, including of course the contributions from the new
coupling terms into its matrix elements. in this case, the operator we shall
deal with reads as follows:

m =  m11 m12

where the m..,0s are the previous matrix elements coming from the curvature
escalar and chern-simons terms, listed in (3.21). proceeding like in (3.36),
we may work out the h  x propagators.
it now becomes clear the importance of the new coupling term a5x fr:
it has the same operator structure as m12,0; therefore, if we set a5 = 6a4, and
a3 = 0, the torsion eld decouples from the graviton and consequently they
can be treated independently. on the other hand, if a3 6= 0, a5 = 6a4, and
a1 = 0, one obtains the following results

from (3.51), we obtain the following condition on the parameters of the

lagrangian for not having a ghost at the massive pole:

a3 = a42, a4 > 0.

(3.52)

furthermore, we remark that the residue matrix of eq. (3.51) provides
two positive eigenvalues, so that this theory propagates a massive spin-2
graviton along with a massive spin-2 quantum of the torsion.

as for the massless pole present in the h  x propagators, it is harm-
less: indeed, like the case where torsion is absent, it is non-dynamical, yield-
ing a vanishing residue for the current-current amplitude. so, the physical
excitations propagated as gravitational degrees of freedom are all massive.

4 concluding comments

the main purpose of our investigation was the assessment of the role torsion
may play in the framework of three-dimensional gravity in the presence of
the topological mass term.

several peculiarities have been found out. for instance, the appearance
of a (gauge-independent) double pole in the spin-2 sector of the graviton
and the torsion propagators, which spoils the unitarity of the model. how-
ever, as we have checked, the inclusion of higher powers of the curvature
(r2 andrr) and a mixing term between the ricci tensor and the spin-
2 part of the torsion may restore unitarity, for the parameters may be so
chosen that the double pole is suppressed.

we have contemplated the possibility of switching o the graviton degrees
of freedom and we have considered the propagation of torsion on a at back-
ground. in such a situation, no double pole shows up and we have checked
that the tree-level unitarity is ensured.

the three dierent spin sectors carried by the torsion tensor in 3d gravity
do not share common characteristics as long as the dynamics is concerned:

14

in the case in which only the einstein-hilbert and the chern-simons terms
are present, the scalar part, , behaves like an auxiliary eld, whereas the
spin-1 sector, t, propagates only its longitudinal component and the spin-2
sector, x, is dynamical. we have not here coupled matter to gravity with
torsion. neverthless, in so doing, minimal coupling to fermions selects only
the scalar component of the torsion to couple directly to fermion bilinears
[20].

with the results we have got here, it might be worthwhile to extend
our analysis to 3d supergravity and try to understand how the dynamics of
torsion and its fermionic counterparts comes out.

also, in view of the niteness of pure gravity described by the chern-
simons term (2.2), we should inquire, once we know how torsion propagates
and interacts, whether or not niteness is kept whenever torsion eects are
included. this matter is now being considered and the results shall be re-
ported elsewhere [21].
