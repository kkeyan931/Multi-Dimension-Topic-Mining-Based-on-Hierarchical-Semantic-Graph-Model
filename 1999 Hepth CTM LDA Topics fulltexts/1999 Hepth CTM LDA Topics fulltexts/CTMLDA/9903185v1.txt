abstract

domain wall - type solution with oscillating thickness in a real,
scalar eld model is investigated with the help of a polynomial approx-
imation. we propose a simple extension of the polynomial approxima-
tion method. in this approach we calculate higher order corrections
to the planar domain wall solution, nd that the domain wall with
oscillating thickness radiates, and compute dumping of oscillations of
the domain wall.

1 introduction

topological defects constitues an important class of solutions in eld-theoretical
models with degenerate vacua. they play very important role in several
branches of physics. let us mention here eld-theoretical cosmology and the
cosmic strings hypothesis (see [1], [2], [3]), dynamics of superconductors, su-
peruids and liquid crystals in condensed matter physics (see [3] - [7]) as well
as a ux tube in qcd.
this short and incomplete list shows the necessity of having eective com-
puting methods to study the dynamics of topological defects.
in spite of
the increasing development of mathematical techniques to solve nonlinear
equations, exact solutions seem not to be the rule and numerical methods
have been the most common approach to study properties of topological de-
fects. therefore analytical and perturbative methods are of great interest
and importance.

in this paper we study domain wall type solution in the 4 model. in
paper [8] excited domain wall of this kind was considered and the radia-
tion emitted from the domain wall was found. in our approach we further
develop the method of a so-called polynomial approximation (see [9], [10]),
which is used to construct the domain wall type solution with time-dependent
thickness. we show how to compute corrections to the polynomial solution.
the corrections consist of two parts: the static one and the time-dependent
one. the time-dependent part of the correction contains radiation emitted
by domain wall with oscillating thickness.

the plan of our paper is the following. in the next section we present
the model. in section 3 we derive the time-dependent planar domain wall
solution in the polynomial approximation. section 4 is devoted to the de-
tailed analysis of this solution. we present the method of nding correction
to the polynomial solution. in sections 5 and 6 we calculate static and time-
dependent part of this correction. in section 7 we analyze the backreaction of
the radiation emitted on the domain wall. in section 8 we shortly summarize
the main points of our work.

2 the model

we consider the model with single, scalar, real - valued eld , dened by
the action:

s = z d4x[

1
2


2

  

(2  v2)2],

(1)

where  = diag(1, 1, 1, 1) and , v are positive constants. the corre-
sponding equation of motion for the eld  has the form:

the energy functional for the model is given by the formula:

  2(2  v2) = 0.

e[] =

1

2 z d3~x[ + (2  v2)2].

(2)

(3)

it is convenient to rescale the space - time coordinates and the scalar eld as
follows:

 =


v

,

t = x0,
 = x3,
x1 = x1, x2 = x2,

(4)
where  = v2. the new variables are dimensionless. the vacuum values
of  in the considered model are equal to 1. conguration of the eld
which smoothly interpolates between these two vacua is called the domain
wall. our goal is to construct the domain wall conguration, localised on
the x1  x2 plane, with the time-dependent width. the planar domain wall
distinguishes the direction perpendicular to the wall plane, given in our case
by the coordinate lines of . as we consider the conguration with  inde-
pendent of the coordinates x1 and x2, we can restrict our approach to the
1 + 1 dimensional model. equation (2) then takes the form:

2
t2 +

2
2  2(2  1) = 0.



static solutions of this equation are well-known. they have the form:

() =  tanh ,

proximation.

in this section we construct approximate domain wall type solution of eq.
(5) with time-dependent width. in order to realize this we use the method
of a polynomial approximation, whose detailed description is given in [9].
the basic idea of this approach is to approximate the scalar eld inside
the domain wall by the polynomial in the variable  with time-dependent
coecients. thus, inside an interval [1, 0] (0 and 1 are positive) we
have:

(t, ) = a(t) +

b(t)2 +

c(t)3.

(7)

the domain wall solution is characterized by the fact, that for suciently
large |  | the eld approaches its vacuum values 1:
  0,
  1.

(t, ) = +1
(t, ) = 1

for
for

(8)

it is possible (see [9]) to adopt more accurate asymptotics for large |  |, with
exponential correction exp(2) to the vacuum values 1. for simplicity
of further calculations we use expressions (8).
we can tune accuracy of our approximation changing degree of the polyno-
mial (7). one can easily notice, that the cubic ansatz presented above is
the simplest, nontrivial choice. the ansatz (7) should be smoothly matched
with the vacuum solutions at  = 0 and  = 1. the matching conditions
follow in a standard manner from eq. (5). one integrates eq. (5) over  in
arbitrary small intervals [1  ,1 + ] ; [0  , 0 + ] and lets   0.
this implies:

from eq. (8) one gets:

(t, ) |=0 = 0,
(t, ) |=1 = 0.

(t, 0) = +1,
(t,1) = 1.

(9)

(10)

the ansatz (7) with matching conditions (9) - (10) allows us to nd solu-
tion of eq. (5) in the proposed form. inserting the expansion (7) into the

3

matching conditions we get, analogously to the case of cylindrical domain
wall discussed in [9], the following conditions for functions a(t), b(t), c(t) and
parameters 0, 1:

0 = 1, a(t) =

3
20

, b(t) = 0, c(t) = 

8a3
9

.

(11)

then we insert the expansion (7) into (5) and equate to zero coecients
in front of successive powers of . after some easy algebra, considering
conditions (11) we get the following equation:

a +

8
9

a3  2a = 0.

(12)

function c(t) is related to a(t) (see formula (11)) and the last step in our
approach is to solve eq. (12). we construct an approximate solution of eq.
(12), which is convenient for the further analysis. with variables redened
as follows:

a(t) =

a(t),

 = 2t,

2

(13)

(14)

eq. (12) takes the form:

a = a  a3,

where now dot denotes the derivative with respect to  . numerical analysis
of eq. (14) shows that there exist periodic solutions of two kinds. periodic
solutions of the rst kind oscillate around static solution a = 1 and take only
positive values; periodic solutions of the second kind oscillate around static
solution a = 1 and take only negative values. we can easily analyse the
oscillating solutions of eq. (14) rewriting it in the form of the two equations of
the rst order by substitution a = b. then periodic solutions are equivalent
to closed trajectories in (a,b) conguration space.
(1, 0), (1, 0) are the
central critical points. the (a,b) conguration space is presented in fig. 1.
in the further part of our discussion we consider only the periodic solutions
oscillating around a = 1, because of the connection between a and the
domain wall thickness parameter, 0. when a(t) > 0 for all  we have also
0, 1 > 0, which is consistent with the interpretation of these parameters.
the periodic solutions oscillating around a = 1 are symmetric (in the sense
that when one changes 0 and 1 by each other it has no inuence on the
dynamics of our system), so we dont discuss this situation. considering all

4

these remarks we restrict our investigation to solutions oscillating with small
amplitude around a = 1. we can write:

a( ) = 1 + ( ),

(15)

where ( ) is small, periodic function. inserting (15) into eq. (14) one gets:

 +  =

(16)

expression (16) has the form of oscillator equation with nonlinear terms. our
goal is to nd its perturbative solution with initial condtions: (0) = 0,
(0) = 0, which describes initially static, sqeezed wall. one can solve the
nonlinear oscillator equation of type (16) using krylov - bogolubov method
(see [19]).the general solution has the form:

( ) =  cos ( ) +

1

0() + xk1

k() cos k( ) + k() sin k( ),

(17)

where functions , , ,  can be calculated in a standard manner (see
[19]) with initial condition (0) = . in our case we nd:

( ) =  cos" 1 +

where  is a small parameter. thus we get solution a(t):

a(t) =

16 ! t#!+o(3).

(19)

formula (19) agrees well with the numerical solutions of eq. (12).
in the last step we have to insert the solution (19) into the ansatz (7) con-
sidering conditions (11). the nal expression for the eld of the oscillating
domain wall in the polynomial approximation has the form:

where

(21)

the function 0(t) can be regarded as the half-width of the domain wall in
the  coordinate. it is given by the formula:

0(t) = 1   cos t +

2 cos 2t + o(3).

(22)

from eq. (21) one can get period of oscillation of the domain wall t = 2/
: t =   o(2). in the case of linear oscillations around static solution (one
can regard this situation neglecting nonlinear terms in (16) - it is admissible
because  is small by denition) one gets  = 2 and t = 2. the formula
(20) can be adopted to the special, static case of domain wall solution, taking
 = 0. it is equivalent to the (1, 0) central, critical point of eq. (16). the
general solution (0)(t, ) can be then treated as a small oscillation (with
amplitude given by the parameter ) around the static solution (0)

s () :

(0)
s () =

3(cid:19) (1 |  |).

(23)

accordingly to eq. (20) initially the domain wall is a bit sqeezed. then it
oscillates with small amplitude around the static solution.

4 correction to the polynomial solution

in this section we propose a simple extension of the pure polynomial solution
obtained above. formula (20) gives us the simplest, approximaty domain
wall - type solution in our model. one can study wider range of phenomena
(e.g. nontrivial asymptotics of the domain wall solution as well as radiation,
which can be emitted by the oscillating domain wall) considering higher -
order corrections to this solution. our goal is to calculate perturbatively
corrections to the zeroth order polynomial solution. let us denote it by
(1)(t, ). thus, we can write the eld satisfying eq. (2) as:

(t, ) = (0)(t, ) + (1)(t, ).

(24)

in order to nd the correction (1)(t, ) let us insert expression (24) into the
eld equation (5). neglecting nonlinear terms in the eld (1) we get:

(1)  2[3(0)2  1](1) = (0) + 2[(0)2  1](0).

(25)

6

we expect that global character of the domain wall solution during time
evolution wont change because of topological stability (in the other words:
the solution remains the planar domain wall type all the time, only small
corrections can occur). thats why the linearization in (25) may be done.
eq. (25) is a linear one with source term j(t, ) given by the formula:

j(t, ) =

2(0)
t2 

2(0)
2 + 2[(0)2  1]0.

(26)

as it was done for the polynomial solution (0) we can split j(t, ) into statical
and time - dependent part:

j(t, ) = js() + jd(t, ).

(27)

from eq. (20) one gets:

js() = " 27

eq. (25) is complicated due to unpleasant form of the polynomial solution
given by eq. (20). we can simplify the operator on the left-hand side of eq.
(25) noticing, that (0) can be split into statical and time-dependent part,
and predominant component tanh  (which is exact, statical solution of the
initial eld equation) can be extracted from the static part as follows:

(0) = tanh  + (0)

s () + (0)

d (t, ),

(30)

inserting expression (30) into the evolution equation and rewriting some
terms on the right-hand side we get nally:

(1)  2h3 tanh2   1i (1) = js() + jd(t, )

+6(cid:16)(0)2
+6 (0)

s  tanh2 (cid:17) (1)
d (cid:16)(0)
d + 2 (0)

s + 2 tanh (cid:17) (1).

(31)

the component in front of (1) in the third term on the right - hand side is
nonzero only on the border of the domain wall and quickly tends to zero when
|  | . analogously, the component in front of (1) in the fourth term
is of order of the small parameter . thus, we have the following, strongly
suggested method of solving eq. (31): in the rst step we put (1) = 0 on
the right-hand side of eq. (31) and solve linear equation for (1) with source
term js() + jd(t, ). the solution obtained in this way can be inserted to the
right-hand side of eq. (31), so in the second step we have to solve equation
with the same linear operator but a new source term. we nd full solution as
a result of such as iterating procedure. nevertheless if components in front
of (1) on the right-hand side are small (and that is our case), we can nd
predominant part of full solution in the rst step.

due to the form of source term (which consist of static and time-dependent
part) it seems natural to split (1) into two components: the static one and
and (1)
the time-dependent one. they are denoted respectively by (1)
d .
from eq. (31) we get:

s

(1)

s  2(cid:16)3 tanh2   1(cid:17) (1)

s = js() + 6(cid:16)(0)2

for the static part of solution, and:

tion

in the rst step we put (1)

our goal in this section is to solve eq.
(32) and nd static part of the
function (1)(t, ). we adopt the method of solving, which was discussed in
the previous section.
s = 0 on the right-hand
side of eq. (32) and solve it in a standard way as a linear, inhomogeneous
equation. then solution (1)
found in this way is inserted to the r.h.s. of eq.
(32) and in the next step equation with a new source term should be solved.
nevertheless, if expression which occur in a new source term as a result of
this procedure is small we get pretty good approximation in the rst step.
the term in front of (1)
s on the r.h.s. of eq (32) is nonzero only on the border
of the domain wall and quickly tends to zero when |  | . eventually we
expect to have a good approximation in the region outside the wall. this
result seems to be acceptable - inside the domain wall the accuracy can be
improved by higher degree of the polynomial in ansatz (7). finally we are
going to solve the linear equation:

(1)

s  2h3 tanh2   1i (1)

s = js().

(35)

the solution can be found by the standard greens function technique. there
exist two linearly independent solutions of the homogenous part of eq. (35):

f1(x) =

f2(x) =

1

,

cosh2 x
1
8

sinh 2x +

3

tanh x +

.

as the greens function we take:

g(, x) = f1(x) f2()(  x)

f1() f2(x)[(  x)  (x)].

9

(36)

(37)

the greens function g(, x) obeys the condition:

g( = 0, x) = 0

dla

x  (,).

(38)

the general solution of eq. (35) has then the form:

(1)

s () = a f1() + b f2() +zr

g(, x)js(x)dx,

(39)

where a and b are arbitrary constants. inserting the greens function (37)
into the formula (39) we get:

(1)

s () =  a z 

0

f2(x)js(x)dx! f1() + b +z 



f1(x)js(x)dx! f2().

(40)
we have to put a = 0 and b = 0 because we are looking for a solution
generated by source term, not for the homogeneous equation solution. an-
other reason for keeping b = 0 is quick (exponential) growth of the function
f2(x) for |  | . in the case b 6= 0 the solution (1)
s () grows exponen-
tially and doesnt meet requirements of the perturbative calculus. combining
expressions (28), (37) and (40) we get nally:

(1)

the static solution with the correction (0)

where one can compare it with the pure polynomial solution (0)
and the
strict, static solution tanh . as it is easy to notice the correction obtained
above forces the polynomial solution to the well-known strict, static solution.
it gives us a strong argument, that spliting the static part of polynomial so-
lution into two parts (one of them is tanh  ) is acceptable. this fact will
be used in the next section.
eq. (32) can be also solved in a straightforward way using numerical meth-
ods. numerical analysis conrms the results obtained above.

6 time - dependent correction to the poly-

nomial solution

in the third term on the r.h.s.

in this section we nd time-dependent correction to the polynomial approx-
imation. we have to solve eq. (33) using the iterative method proposed in
section 4. the second term on the r.h.s. of the eq. (33) is of the order of
the small parameter  and can be neglected in the rst approximation. the
coecient in front of (1)
is the same as in
d
eq. (32) discussed in the previous section. now it is necessary to specify
more precisely the scenario of evolution of the discussed domain wall. for
t < 0 the domain wall is static and, as was discussed in the section 6 has the
form of the strict, static solution tanh  (see (6)). in t = 0 the domain wall
is squeezed by 2 as a result of action of an external force. the evolution at
later times is governed by the eld equation (33).
this scenario helps us to understand the role of the last term on the r.h.s.
of eq. (33). in the simplest case we can state that it is small for   ,
and by neglecting it we obtain good approximation in the rst step in this
region. nevertheless from the discussion presented above we can conclude
that we get quite good solution in the whole range of . to prove this we
rewrite the third term on the l.h.s. thus we have:

(1)

()  1i (1)
d + 2 (0)

s + 2 tanh (cid:17)(cid:16)(1)

s (cid:17) .
d + (1)

due to the results of section 6 the static part of the polynomial solution is
corrected by the function (1)
s , which has been calculated above. when we
take some terms of higher order (which can be obtained in the next steps

(44)

11

of calculation) we can change (0) 2
expression ((0)
in fig. 2 we have:

s + (1)

on the r.h.s. of eq. (33) by improved
s )2. from the discussion presented above and illustrated

s

(0)
s + (1)

s  tanh .

(45)

in the rst step we are then going to solve the linear, inhomogeneous equa-
tion:

this can be rewritten as a wave equation:

(1)

d  2h3 tanh2   1i (1)

d = jd(t, ).

" 2
t2 + d2# (1)

d (t, ) = jd(t, ),

where operator d2 has the form:

d2 = " 2

2  2(3 tanh2   1)# .

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

eq. (47) can be solved by the standard greens function technique. we cal-
culate greens function for opearator d2 using expansion in eigenfunctions.
we are looking for the greens function g(, t; , t), which fulll the equa-
tion:

" 2
t2 + d2# g(, t; , t) = (t  t)(  ),

and obeys the condition:

g(, t; , t) = 0

for

t < t.

if the set of eigenfuctions {n} is given, we can construct greens function
in a standard manner. detailed description of this procedure is given in [20].
the greens function can be written as:

g(, t; , t) = k(, t; , t)(t  t),

(51)

where propagator k(, t; , t) has the form:

k(, t; , t) = 0()0()(t  t) + xn6=0

n()n()

sin[n(t  t)]

n

.

(52)

12

the solution of the inhomogenous equation is given by the formula:

d (t, ) = zr
(1)

dz t



dtk(, t; , t) jd(t, ).

(53)

because jd(t < 0, ) = 0 we can simplyfy (53) as folows:

d (t, ) = zr
(1)

dz t

0

dtk(, t; , t) jd(t, ).

(54)

the problem of calculating time-dependent correction to the polynomial so-
lution is then reduced to nding the system of eigenfunctions of operator d2.
this system is well-known (see e.g. )and consists of two discrete eigenvalues
and continous spectrum with corresponding eigenfunctions:

let us give an interpretation of these two parts of the nal solution. (1)
d () is
connected with the 1 mode in the system of eigenfunctions of the operator
d2. the interaction with 1 generates in the time-dependent correction (1)
d
the component, which exponentialy vanishes for large  and oscillates.
it
can be treated as a form of excitation of the domain wall given by 1. the
crucial role which this component plays in dynamics of our system is more
transparently visible in the process of collision of kinks (see [16] and [17]).
the component (1)
d () has the form of a wavepacket - the oscillations of the
domain wall generate radiation. thus we have the following scenario of the
discused phenomena:
in t = 0 the external force sqeezed the domain wall
by 2. the wall oscillates around the static conguration. the oscillations
generate radiation as in the formula (63). it is natural to restrict (1)
d () to
waves going out from the wall:

for  < 0 the result is analogous.
the solution (1)

(66)
the waves have the frequency (k) = k2 + 4 so they satisfy the dispersion

to plot the function (1)
d () given by the formula (65) we calculate it numeri-
cally for some xed values of t and   (0, 20), with the step  = 0.1. the
nal result is presented in fig. 3 - 7. one can easily see the causal character
of obtained solution. in the region outside the light-cone the eld (1)
d () is
nearly equal to 0. the uctuations are caused mainly by computation errors.
this fact was checked by decreasing the step of integration - the uctuations
decrease then too. the eld (1)
d () is small - on the gures it is multiplied by
factor 102. this once again conrms the approximation used in our approach.

7 backreaction of the radiation

in the previous section we have shown that the considered, oscillating domain
wall radiates. thus, we have the energy owing out from the domain wall.
we can then expect dumping of oscillations of the domain wall.
in this
section we construct a simple model of this process. we start from equation
of energy balans:

de(0)

dt

= f (t),

(69)

where e(0) is the energy per unit area of the domain wall for the polynomial
solution and f (t) is the energy emitted from unit square in the moment t.
from eq. (3) one can calculate e(0). neglecting terms of the second and
higher order in  we get:

e(0) = e(0)

s + e(0)

d  cos t,

(70)

s  1.58, e(0)

d  0.81. e(0)

s

(70) e(0) is time-dependent.

where e(0)
is the energy of the static, polynomial
domain wall solution. one can easily compare it with the energy of the strict,
static solution tanh : e[tanh ]  1.33. as we can expect the energy e(0)
is a bit greater than e[tanh ].
in eq.
it is caused by limitted accuracy of
the polynomial solution - in the case of a strict solution energy should be
independent on time. in t = 0 we have e(0)
as the energy of our
conguration. for t > 0 it oscillates as a result of approximation in the
polynomial solution, nevertheless for the strict solution it should be constant.
accordingly we take:

s + e(0)

d

s

e(0) = e(0)(0) = e(0)

s + e(0)
d .

(71)

16

the parameter  describes the amplitude of the domain wall oscillations. in
reality it is time-dependent:   (t) (and we expect that it decreases as
a result of radiation emitted from the wall). the energy ux can be easily
calculated from the energy-momentum tensor for the action (1):

the energy ux density t i0 is given by the formula:

t  =   + l.

t i0 = i 0.

(72)

(73)

from the continuity equation we can get in a standard manner expression
for f (t):

f (t) = 2(cid:16)0(1)

d () (1)

d ()(cid:17) |=1+ .

as (1)

d ()   we can re-dene the eld as follows:

(1)
d () =  (1)

d ().

thus, we have:

(74)

(75)

(76)

f (t) = 2(cid:16)0 (1)

d ()  (1)

d ()(cid:17) |=1+ .

collecting the formulae (69), (71) and (76) one gets the following dierential
equation for (t):

(t) = 2 1
d (cid:16)0 (1)
e(0)

d ()  (1)

d ()(cid:17) |=1+ .

(77)

the solution of eq. (77) with the initial condition (0) =  reads:

(t) =

1  (0)

e(0)

d

(0)
d ()  (1)

0 (cid:16)0 (1)
r t

d ()(cid:17) |=1+ dt

.

(78)

eventually to nd the solution (t) one needs the value of the eld (1)
d ()
on the border of the domain wall, which was calculated numerically in the
previous section.
we have performed the numerical computations for three dierent values of
the initial oscillation amplitude, namely: (0) = 0.01, 0.1, 0.3. the nal
result is presented in figs. 8, 9 and 10. the dumping of oscillations, as we

17

can expect, is the quickest when we have the greatest amplitude.
the plots of function (t) have characteristic bends at multiplicities of half-
period of oscillations t = 2/ =   o(2). we can interprete them as
follows: the energy is most strongly radiated from the wall when the velocity
of oscillations is the greatest - near the returning points the velocity is small
and the dumping is slower. this coincides with the half-period of oscillations.
for small, initial amplitudes of the oscillations the dumping is very weak. in
the case of (0) = 0.01 during the time of approximately 4 oscillation periods
the amplitude decreases only by 4%. for (0) = 0.1 and 0.3 the corresponding
values are 25% and 75%. these two cases can however be outside the region
of application of our approximation (it demands (0)  1 ).

8 remarks

let us briey summarize the main points of our work. we have derived
the planar domain wall solution with the time-dependent thickness in the
polynomial approximation. the planar domain wall oscillates with small
amplitude. we have then proposed an approach enabling us to calculate the
correction to the pure polynomial solution. we have split this correction
into two parts. the time-dependent part contains the component which is
interpreted as the radiation from the oscillating domain wall.

there are several possible extensions and generalizations of our approach.
it can be applied without much trouble to the other eld-theoretical models.
in our paper we discuss only the case of small oscillations around the static
solution. as one can easily see in fig. 1 there exist also solutions oscillating
with amplitude which is not small. this case should be discussed separately.
in accordance with our discussion in section 7 we can expect very quick
dumping of the oscillations. on the other hand, we should remember that
our method is based on the linear approximation and is reliable for small am-
plitudes of oscillations only. thus, the process of creating the kink-antikink
pair is also possible.
