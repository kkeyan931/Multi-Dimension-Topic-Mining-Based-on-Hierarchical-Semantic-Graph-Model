abstract

utilizing ads/cft correspondence in m-theory, an example of interacting d = 3 conformal
eld theories and renormalization group ow between them is presented. near-horizon ge-
ometry of n coincident m2-branes located on a conical singularity on eight-dimensional hy-
perkahler manifold or manifold with spin(7) holonomy is, in large-n limit, ads4  x7, where
x7 is seven-sphere with squashing. deformation from round s7 to squashed one is known to
lead to spontaneous breaking of n = 8 local supersymmetry in gauged ads4 supergravity to
n = 1, 0. via ads/cft correspondence, it is interpreted as renormalization group ow from
so(5)so(3) symmetric uv xed point to so(8) symmetric ir xed point. evidences for the
interpretation are found both from supergravity scalar potential and existence of interpolating
static domain-wall thereof, and from conformal dimensions of relevant chiral primary operator
at each xed point.

introduction

in spacetime of dimensions more than two, few examples are known for interacting conformal
eld theories or for renormalization group ows among themselves. this is especially so in

three dimensions, as the infrared limit corresponds typically to a strong coupling limit. known
examples include non-gaussian xed point of o(n) vector model in large n limit, infrared limit
of (non)abelian gauge theories with n = 8, 4 or 2 supersymmetries. the latter can be obtained
by dimensional reduction of four-dimensional gauge theories with n = 4, 2, 1 supersymmetries.
as such, r-symmetries, holomorphy and supersymmetry non-renormalization theorems put

strong constraints to the moduli space of these theories. combining these analysis, a relation
called mirror symmetry between infrared limit of dierent gauge theories has been discovered

[1] and rederived using brane congurations [2] : kahler (complex) structure on the coulomb
branch of an n = 4 (n = 2) gauge theory is mapped to that on the higgs branch of its mirror
and vice versa.

in contrast, three-dimensional n = 1 superconformal eld theories do not have any contin-
uous r-symmetries, holomorphy constraints or any known non-renormalization theorems. as

such, it would be quite dicult to draw any useful information regarding these theories. the
diculty may be exemplied, for instance, from the infrared limit of a n = 1 brane cong-
uration consisting of nc d3-branes between a pair of rotated ns5-branes and nf d5-branes:
the higgs branch can be reached from any point on the coulomb branch and hence, classically,

every point of the moduli space denes an interacting conformal eld theory. the situation
suggests that one would really need to follow technically a rather dierent route in order to
understand three-dimensional n = 1 superconformal eld theories.

in this paper, utilizing dual correspondence between (d + 1)-dimensional anti-de sitter
supergravity and d-dimensional conformal eld theory (ads/cft correspondence) [3, 4, 5], we
will present an example of interacting n = 1 superconformal eld theory (with some global
symmetries) and renormalization group ow thereof. the example is based on the well-known

result in kaluza-klein supergravity [6]: compactication of eleven-dimensional supergravity to
four-dimensional anti-de sitter spacetime on round-s7 with so(8) isometry or squashed-s7 with
so(5)  so(3) isometry [7]. for the freund-rubin compactication [8] of eleven-dimensional
supergravity [9] on a seven-dimensional compact manifold x7 that is topologically s7, it has
been known that round and squashed seven-spheres are the only possibilities, and that both are

stable, at least, at perturbative level. more appropriately, the compactications correspond to
m-theory vacua describing near-horizon geometry of two distinct congurations (one spherically

symmetric and another non-spherical) of n coincident m2-branes.

in doing so, we will also discover another closely related, nonsupersymmetric interacting
conformal eld theory, which ows along the same renormalization group trajectory as the n =

1

1 counterpart. this comes about as follows. an important aspect of the s7 compactication is
that, depending on the choice of the orientation, one and the same squashing deformation leads
to two distinct vacua . denoting chirality of supercharges on ads4 (which has descended from
killing spinors on x7) as (nl, nr), the round and the squashed seven-spheres are known to
preserve (8, 8) and (1, 0) supersymmetries, respectively. because of triality of so(8), squashing

deformations can proceed in two dierent embeddings (so-called skew-whipping [6]) of residual
isometries: so(8)  [so(5)so(3)]c for left-handed orientation or [so(5)so(3)]s for right-
handed orientation. thus, for the squashing with left-handed orientation, the renormalization
group ow interpolates between conformal eld theories with n = 8 and n = 1 supersymmetry,
while for the squashing with right-handed orientation, the ow interpolates between conformal
eld theories with n = 8 and n = 0. along the deformation, the so-called space invader
scenario  complicated level-crossing phenomena among massless and massive kaluza-klein

states  then implies that the supersymmetry is broken completely (except the two endpoints)
and the scaling dimension of operators will become renormalized in a highly nontrivial manner.

for both choices of orientation, however, the squashing deformation turns out to be governed
by one and the same kaluza-klein mode. hence, for both n = 1 and 0 conformal eld theories,
the renormalization group ow ought to be governed by the same scaling operator.

we will begin our analysis in section 2 by recapitulating relevant aspects of round and
squashed s7 compactication vacua in eleven-dimensional supergravity, but rephrased in terms
of m2-brane parameters.
in section 3, we will investigate squashing deformation of each
vacua, and nd that the deformation is described by an irrelevant operator at the n = 8
conformal xed point, but by a relevant operator at the n = 1 or 0 conformal xed points. the
renormalization group ows along the squashing deformation trajectory would then interpolate
between n = 8 xed point at the infrared and n = 1 or 0 at the ultraviolet. as suggested in
[10], the renormalization group ow is described in ads4 supergravity by a static domain wall
interpolating between the round- and the squashed-s7 vacua. in section 4, developing rst a
general argument regarding nonperturbative stability, we will reproduce the renormalization
group ow along the squashing trajectory as a static domain wall.

throughout this paper, we will be using the metric convention (, +,   , +). the eleven-
dimensional planck scale is denoted by p. our notation is that the d = 11 coordinates with
indices a, b,   are decomposed into d = 4 spacetime coordinates x with indices , ,   and
d = 7 internal space coordinates y with indices a, b,  . denoting the d = 11 metric as gab

2 ads4 supergravity vacua: round and squashed s7

in this section, we will be recapitulating some of the relevant results regarding spontaneous
compactication of d = 11 supergravity on ads4  x7, where x7 denotes a seven-dimensional
compact einstein manifold. the x7 refers to the near-horizon geometry of m2-branes. for
x7 dieomorphic to round seven-sphere, it is well-known that there exist only two possible

einstein manifolds [7] 2 : round and squashed seven-spheres. we will denote them by s7 and fs7,
respectively. the latter is a homogeneous space [so(5) so(3)]/[so(3) so(3)] with a weak
g2 holonomy. in fact, generically, m2-branes on a (noncompact) eight-dimensional hyperkahler
manifold or manifold with spin(7) holonomy, the near-horizon geometry is expected to vary

from spherical to squashed seven-sphere as the branes are placed away or at a conical singularity
of the manifold [12, 11].

embedded into d = 11, the interpolating metric between round and squashed seven-spheres

may be written as

the parameter r measures the overall radius of curvature. the scalar elds u(x), v(x)
parametrize size and squashing deformation of s7 over d = 4 spacetime: vol(s7) = 1
3 4e7ur7,
and squashing is parametrized by 2  e7v.

spontaneous compactication of m-theory to ads4  s7 is obtained from near-horizon
geometry of n coindicent m2-branes. geometry of the horizon can be deformed continuously
but, as mentioned above, the resulting horizon is an einstein manifold only for round- or
squashed-s7s. through the seven-sphere, the m2-branes thread nonvanishing ux of four-form
eld strength of the freund-rubin form:

it is also possible to get exotic non-spherical horizons that are topologically equivalent to s7 but not dieomor-
phic to it [11]. isometry group of the exotic seven-spheres is so(2) or so(3) and hence may correspond to
n = 2, 3 superconformal eld theories.

the d = 4 eld equations resulting from insertion of the ansatz eqs.(2, 3) into eq.(1) can

maximum 3. recall that u, v elds parametrize all possible deformation of s7, but restricted
to retain at least so(5) so(3) isometry subgroup. the s7 critical point is actually invariant
under the full so(8) isometry group, while the fs7 is invariant only under the minimal so(5)

so(3) subgroup.

the s7 has a trivial holonomy group that it gives rise to (nl, nr) = (8, 8) killing spinors.
therefore, for either choice of the orientation of seven-sphere, the near-horizon geometry pre-
serves maximal n = 8 supersymmetry. on the other hand, having a weak g2 holonomy, it
turns out that the fs7 gives rise to (1, 0) killing spinors. as such, near-horizon geometry pre-
serves minimal n = 1 supersymmetry for left-handed orientation of the seven-sphere and no
supersymmetry at all for right-handed orientation. the two alternative choices of the seven-

sphere orientation may be viewed as reversal of page charge, which is identical to the m2-brane
charge (up to numerical factors). this means that, when approaching a conical singularity of
an eight-dimensional manifold with spin(7) holonomy, m2- and m2-branes behave dierently.
in particular, there will generically be a net attractive force among m2-branes 4.

4 in fact, conical singularities of hyperkahler or calabi-yau fourfolds exhibit the same phenomena. the
near-horizon geometry x7 is, for each of them, 3-sasaki manifold with killing spinors (3, 0) or sasaki-einstein
manifold with killing spinors (2, 0), respectively [12].

3 three-dimensional conformal field theories

in the investigation of the kaluza-klein compactication on the seven-sphere, the pheonomenon
of squashing has been interpreted as triggering spontaneous (super)symmetry breaking via

the (super) higgs-kibble mechanism [6]. two important features discovered regarding the
compactication and squashing deformation thereof are the space invader scenario and skew-
whipping orientation reversal. according to the space invader scenario, along the continuous
squashing deformation, kaluza-klein spectrum for spin 2, 1, and 0+ do not change under
the skew-whipping. in particular, the squashing deformation is part of 0+ scalar modes and
hence it can be studied on equal footing for both orientation of the seven-sphere.

in this section, utilizing the above aspects and the results of section 2 on kaluza-klein

spectrum under squashing deformation, we will be identifying an operator that gives rise to a
renormalization group ow associated with the symmetry breaking so(8)  so(5)  so(3)
and nd that the operator is relevant at the fs7 xed point but becomes irrelevant at the s7

xed point.

3.1 so(8) invariant conformal fixed point

let us begin with x7 = s7. associated with it is the d = 3 conformal eld theory with n = 8
supersymmetry and so(8) r-symmetry. this theory describes the conformal origin of the
moduli space of three-dimensional n = 8 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with gauge group
su(n), at which the gauge coupling becomes innitely strong. away from the origin, the
gauge group is broken to u(1)n 1 and the moduli space is given by r8n /sn [14].

to identify conformal eld theory operator corresponding to the squashing perturbation
(while preserving so(5)  so(3) isometry), we shall be considering harmonic uctuations
of spacetime metric and u(x), v(x) scalar elds around ads4  s7.
inferring from eq.(5),
uctuation of these elds is compactly summarized by the lagrangian:

ls7 = g(cid:18)r  21 

63

(u)2  21(v)2  2v1(u, v)(cid:19) ,

(11)

where 1 = 1

e21(uu1)(cid:19) .

(12)

for our present purpose, following [13], it turns out more convenient to rewrite eq.(11) in

terms of the un-rescaled, m-theory metric g = e7ug:

ls7 = ge7u(cid:16) r  105(u)2  21(v)2  e7uv (u, v)(cid:17)

= ge7u(cid:16) r  21  105(u)2  21(v)2  2v1(u, v)(cid:17) .

(14)

(15)

we have denoted the curvature radius as rir since, as we shall see shortly, the round s7
ground-state is stable against squashing perturbation and hence corresponds to an infrared

stable xed point. moreover, comparing the cosmological constant with that of spherical, near-
horizon geometry of n coincident m2-branes, one nds that rir is related to n and planck
scale p as rir = p

1

2(322n)1/6.

conformal dimension of the perturbation operator that represents the squashing is de-

termined by uctuation spectrum of the scalar elds. after rescaling the scalar elds as

210u  u,42v  v, one nds that the (correctly normalized) uctuation spectrum for

v-eld around the s7 takes a positive value:

m 2

p = +16m2

(16)

the v-eld represents squashing of s7 and hence, under so(8) isometry group, ought to
correspond to 300, the lowest mode of the transverse, traceless symmetric tensor representation.
recall that, on s7, mass spectrum of the representation corresponding to so(8) dynkin label
(n  2, 2, 0, 0) is given by

gm 2 =(cid:16)(n + 3)2  9(cid:17) m2,

(17)

where m2 is mass-squared parameter of a given ads4 spacetime and mass of a scalar eld s is

dened according to (ads + gm 2)s = 0. this follows easily from the known mass formula [16]
m 2 = l  4m2, where the lichnerowicz operator l has eigenvalues l = [n(n + 6) + 12]m2
for o+(2), and the fact that m 2 is traditionally dened according to (ads  8m2 + m 2)s = 0.
for 300 (corresponding to n = 2), gm 2

2lp(322n)1/6, one nds that eq.(16) ts perfectly with 300

300 = 16m2 and this ought to equal to eq.(16).

indeed, recalling that rir = 1

spectrum:

vv(s7) = 16 |q|

(18)

via ads/cft correspondence, one thus concludes that, in d = 3 conformal eld theory with
n = 8 supersymmetry, the so(5)  so(3) symmetric squashing ought to be an irrelevant

7

perturbation of conformal dimension  = 4. note that this is the same for either choice of the
seven-sphere orientation.

an important point is that the squashing deformation arises not at the lowest level but at
the second of the s7 kaluza-klein tower. as such, the deformation probes m-theory beyond
the so-called consistent truncation of eleven-dimensional supergravity, viz.
four-dimensional
n = 8 gauged supergravity.
3.2 so(5)  so(3) invariant conformal fixed point
consider next the conformal xed point corresponding to the x7 = fs7. as mentioned already,
due to the possibility of skew-whipping, the xed point could be either left-squashed gs7l with
n = 1 supersymmetry or right-squashed gs7r with no supersymmetry.
from eq.(5), harmonic uctuation of u(x), v(x) scalar elds around x7 = fs7 is compactly

again, in terms of the un-rescaled m-theory metric, the lagrangian eq.(19) may be reorganized

once again, the scalar eld v(x) parametrize squashing perturbation around fs7. mass spec-

(24)

the spectrum is tachyonic but stays above the breitenlohner-freedman bound [15] and hence,

in the corresponding dual, unitary conformal eld theory, the squashing deformation ought to
be described by a relevant operator.

8

the tachyonic spectrum eq.(24) can be understood as follows. under so(8)  so(5) 
so(3) , the branching rule of a so(8) dynkin label (0, 2, 0, 0) (corresponding to the represen-

tation 300) in terms of so(5) dynkin label (p, q) and so(3) dynkin label (r) (or in terms of
their respective representations) is given as follows [17]:

(0, 2, 0, 0) = (02)(4)  (21)(2)  (40)(0)  (01)(4)  (02)(0)

(20)(2)  (01)(2)  (00)(4)  (00)(0).

in terms of their representations,

300 = (14, 5)  (35, 3)  (35, 1)  (5, 5)  (14, 1)

(10, 3)  (5, 3)  (1, 5)  (1, 1).

(25)

(26)

since the squashing preserves so(5)  so(3) isometry group, the spectrum eq.(24) ought to
correspond to that of the singlet (the last state in the branching rule, eq.(26)). one can check
this explicitly. the eigenfunctions of the lichnerowicz operator l appear in the so(5)so(3)
representations found by decomposing the (0, 2, 0, 0) of so(8). depending on the particular
representations of so(5)  so(3), eigenvalues are given by [18]:

l =

(27)

for 8v, 8s and 8c, respectively. here, cg denotes the second-order casimir operator for the
isometry group and is given by cg = cso(5) + 3cso(3). recall that, in our notation, mass-

squared spectrum of a o+(2) scalar eld s satisfying (ads + gm 2)s = 0 is given by gm 2 =
l  12m2. for the singlet (1, 1), cg = 0 and one obtains gm(1,1)

henceforth, identifying eq.(24) with the lower, one identies

(28)

one thus nds that the perturbation that corresponds to squashing around x7 = fs7 has a

scaling dimension either  = 4/3 or 5/3 and hence corresponds to a relevant operator.

note that, of the two possible scaling dimensions, the lower one is below the naive unitarity

bound 3/2 in three-dimensional conformal eld theories. the two-fold ambiguity of the scaling
dimension arises for relevant operators whose scaling dimension is below the naive unitarity
bound and, in ads4 spacetime, originates from the fact that a scalar eld whose mass is
in the range (9/4,5/4) (in units of 4m2) can be quantized in two inequivalent boundary
conditions [15, 19]. klebanov and witten [20] have argued that the two possible choices of the

scaling dimension are related to two distinct dual conformal eld theories and have conrmed it

9

explicitly in several examples in which r-symmetry is continuous. in the present situation, by
the same argument, the two scaling dimensions of squashing deformation operator ought to
correspond to each of the two n = 1, 0 conformal eld theories, but, as there is no continuous
r-symmetry, we were not able to resolve the twofold ambiguity completely.

in the previous section, round and squashed seven-spheres have been identied as two possible
near-horizon geometry of n coincident m2-branes. both seven-spheres then represent stable

vacua of eleven-dimensional supergravity, at least in perturbative expansion in powers of 1/n
and p, as there is no tachyon mode equal to or below the breitenlohner-freedman bound [15]

the gauged supergravity potential, may tunnel (without barrier), as a result of false vacuum
decay [22], to the s7 ground-state.

semiclassically, such a tunnelling process would be described by a gravitational instanton.
however, utilizing the result of [23, 24], it is straightforward to see that the relevant gravitational
instanton has an innite action, leading to a complete suppression of the false vacuum decay.
consider an ansatz of the gravitational instanton in ads4 that preserves, at the least, the so(3)
rotational symmetry. it then follows that unique instanton conguration is a time-translation

as the instanton is translationally invariant along time direction, the semiclassical instanton

one immediately notes that eqs.(32, 33) may be interpreted as equations of motion of an
analog particle (of unit mass) in two dimensions, whose coordinates are parametrized by u
and v, under the inuence of an analog potential v (u, v). the particle is also subject to a
frictional force. the dynamic friction coecient (3h2/z) turns out negative-denite always.
intuitively, this follows from the fact that h = 0 in the limit the gravity is turned o p  0
and that the physics ought to be analytic in powers of 2
p. because of the anti-friction, the
analog particle can start from the minima of v initially (viz. at z = 0) and then creep up to
the maxima of v nally (viz. at z = ). what is less clear is that the anti-frictional energy
injected to the analog particle equals precisely to the potential energy dierence 2(1  2).
answer to the question is provided by the fact that, from eqs.(32-33), u, v  0 is satised at
critical points of the scalar potential v and the fact that the resulting minkowski domain-wall

is an extremal conguration, saturating domain-wall energy density. an important point is

that this also applies to the nonsupersymmetric es7r vacuum, as the eld equations eqs.(32 -
35) govern stability for both es7l and es7r. the extremality condition implies that energy gain

by creating a region of true vacuum around z = 0 inside false vacuum is balanced exactly by
mass of the so(3) symmetric domain-wall, viz. saturation of the coleman-deluccia bound and

hence is a posteriori consistent with the static domain-wall ansatz. while an exact solution of
the domain-wall conguration is not possible in analytic form, asymptotics of the domain-wall

can be studied straightforwardly. using the asymptotics, we will now check consistency of the
so(3) symmetric domain-wall conguration. in the ir region, z  , asymptotic solutions
of h(z), u(z) and v(z) are given by

h(z)  0 +

solving the equations of motion eqs.(32 - 35), one obtains

16h +(cid:16)u2

(cid:17) = 0,

 + v2
3 + r21 = 0.

12

the rst equation implies that h < 0, viz. the scale factor h(z) asymptotes to 0. then,
using this fact and the rescaling relation r2
ir, one nds that the second equation
implies that r = rir.

ir = e7u1r2

in the uv region, z  0, asymptotic solutions of h(z), u(z), and v(z) are given by

h(z)  (1  ) ln z + h0z2b +   
u(z)  s 7
v(z)  s 42

ln(cid:16)34510/7q2(cid:17) + u0zb +

change of variables w = zc and trivial rescaling of x coordinates bring the asymptotic metric
back into the ads4 form, but with a scaled radius of curvature rir/. this is precisely the

radius of curvature ruv of the fs7l,r vacua, and hence conrms the consistency of the asymptotic
solution. from the equations of motion, one also nds conditions h0 < 0 and b2 + ( 3
2 
2)b  5
26 2 = 0. choosing positive root of b, one obtains regular asymptotote of eq.(36) with
monotonic rescaling of the curvature of radius.

another question is during the interpolation between the two vacua, whether the scalar

elds u, v are critically damped (as depicted in figure 2) or under-damped (in which case the
scalar elds will excute nite number of oscillations before settling down to the maxima of v ).
in the analog particle interpretation, mode decomposition (obtained from laplace transform
of eqs.(33, 34) around minimum of v ) takes precisely the same form as the fourier transform
of their equations of motion in ads4. suppose that the scalar eld is tachyonic below the
breitenlohner-freedman bound. in this case, two eigen-frequencies take a complex-value and
corresponds to an under-damped interpolation. hence, the interpolation is always critically

damped for scalar elds whose masses are above the breitenlohner-freedman bound. restated,
renormalization group ows between unitary conformal eld theories ought to be monotonic

always and never exhibits an oscillatory behavior.

the monotonic radial behavior of the static so(3) domain-wall conguration is, as suggested

by [10], the holographic representation of the renormalization group ow and a version of c-
theorem thereof. we have shown that well-dened renormalization-group ow and c-theorem
exist only if the supergravity vacua are stable both perturbatively and nonperturbatively. non-

perturbative instability of a perturbatively stable vacuum is signalled by an existence of a
gravitational instanton with a nite euclidean action. analytically continuing to minkowski

spacetime, the instanton corresponds to an expanding (or contracting) domain-wall instead of

being a static one. under the ads/cft correspondence, such a time-dependent process does
not admit interpretation as a renormalization group ow.

so far, we have considered a particular one-parameter renormalization group ow between
conformal xed points of m2-brane worldvolume theory. geometrically, the ow is induced

from varying the position of m2-brane when placed near a conical singularity of an eight-
dimensional manifold with spin(7) holonomy.
in the infrared limit, the conical singularity
and hence squshing of m2-brane horizon are washed out completely. at the infrared xed

point with so(8) symmetry, one may also ow further into another xed points by turning
on a set of relevant operators. it includes scalar operators of dynkin label (n, 0, 0, 0), n  2
and pseudoscalar operators of dynkin label (n, 0, 2, 0), n  0. among them are 70 scalar
elds 35v  35c of so(8) in the massless gravity supermultiplet, parametrizing the coset space
e7(7)/su(8). decomposing them under so(5)so(3)  so(8), 35v+35c  2[(5, 1)+(10, 3)].
turning on the two relevant operators (5, 1) breaks so(8)  so(3)  so(3). utilizing on
the known result [25], distler and zamora [26] have studied renormalization group ow to a
nonsupersymmetric vacuum with so(3)  so(3) global symmetry (see figure 3). unlike the
skew-whipping nonsupersymmetric vacua as we have studied, however, their analysis does

not shed any light on stability of the vacua. it is a logical possibility that, along a direction
in coset space e7(7)/su(8) ( orthogonal to so(3)  so(3) orbit), perturbations violate the

14

breitenlohner-freedman bound and the corresponding conformal eld theory is nonunitary.
