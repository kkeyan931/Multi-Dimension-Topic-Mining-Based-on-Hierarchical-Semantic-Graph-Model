the physical properties of reissnernordstrom black holes in (n+1)dimensional antide sitter
spacetime are related, by a holographic map, to the physics of a class of ndimensional eld theories
coupled to a background global current. motivated by that fact, and the recent observations of the
striking similarity between the thermodynamic phase structure of these black holes (in the canonical
ensemble) and that of the van der waalsmaxwell liquidgas system, we explore the physics in more
detail. we study uctuations and stability within the equilibrium thermodynamics, examining the
specic heats and electrical permittivity of the holes, and consider the analogue of the clayperon
equation at the phase boundaries. consequently, we rene the phase diagrams in the canonical and
grand canonical ensembles. we study the interesting physics in the neighbourhood of the critical
point in the canonical ensemble. there is a second order phase transition found there, and that
region is characterized by a landauginzburg model with a3 potential. the holographically dual
eld theories provide the description of the microscopic degrees of freedom which underlie all of the
thermodynamics, as can be seen by examining the form of the microscopic uctuations.

i. introduction and summary

explaining the thermodynamic nature of black holes was recognized as an essential hallmark of any complete
quantum theory of gravity long before such a theory was constructed. the semiclassical approach to quantum
gravity, which has become quite a mature subject over the years [1,2], allows for the computation of a number of
physical quantities. these treatments ignore the details of how a specic solution of einsteins equations (regarded as
the eective low energy truncation of the complete quantum gravity) arises, and instead perform a quantum treatment
of eld degrees of freedom in a xed classical spacetime background.

in that way it was learned that the entropy of bekenstein [3] and the temperature of hawking [4], for example,
t into an elegant thermodynamic framework, with questions (such as scattering, unitarity, etc.,) concerning the
underlying microscopic description which we might use to construct the underlying statistical mechanics best
left for the future development of a quantum theory of gravity.

that future is now here. string theory (and/or mtheory) supplies a microscopic description of the underlying
degrees of freedom upon which a statistical description of the laws of black hole thermodynamics can be based. this is
true even though we do not yet have a satisfactory way of writing the theory in all regimes: the dbrane calculus [5]
provides a robust framework within which to describe many properties of black holes [6], while in turn being rmly
rooted in the dynamical framework of string duality and, ultimately, mtheory [7]. typically, the description of black
holes (and other important geometrical backgrounds) proceeds by translating their properties into properties of an
auxiliary eld theory, identied as residing on the worldvolume of some collection of (d or m) branes.

one of the succinct ways of organizing this microscopic description of the properties of black holes is via ads
holography [812]. then, the thermodynamic properties of black holes in antide sitter spacetime are dual to

1

those of a eld theory in one dimension fewer [10,11]. the fact that the thermodynamic properties of the ads black
holes [13] are organized by an eective eld theory is not implausible, in the light of the fact that ads acts like a
natural box (with reecting walls) which neutralizes the tendency of gravitational interactions to render a canonical
thermodynamic ensemble unstable. the fact that the eective eld theory is one which does not contain gravity, and
that it is actually a holographically dual four dimensional gauge theory (with suitable generalizations beyond d=4)
is another striking example of the fundamental role that gauge theory plays in duality in various situations1.

that the ads arena stabilizes the thermodynamics of black holes is especially apparent when one discovers phase
structures completely analogous to familiar thermodynamic systems from elsewhere in nature. such an example can
be found in the reissnernordstromantidesitter (rnads) systems in various dimensions [17]. there, the (q, t )
diagram showing the thermally stable phases for a xed charge (canonical) ensemble turns out to be completely
analogous to that of the (t, p ) phase diagram of the liquidgas system. the structure of the rst order phase
transitions, etc., are controlled by a cusp catastrophe [18], common in the theory of discontinuous transitions in
thermodynamics and many other elds2. meanwhile the free energy as a function of temperature f (t ), displays the
characteristic swallowtail shape.

in this paper, we report the results of our further examination of these structures, exploring the equilibrium
thermodynamics more closely, including the eects of considering electrical stability, and thermal uctuations. the
similarities noted between the rnads physics and that of welldened systems such as the liquidgas are more
than mere analogies: we nd that everything has a very natural place in classic equilibrium thermodynamics, as is
consistent with a holographic duality to thermal eld theory without gravity. accordingly, using the techniques of
equilibrium thermodynamics, we rene the phase diagrams which we found in ref. [17] somewhat, and identify the
generic physical properties which give rise to the cusp and swallowtail structures.

as discussed in our previous paper [17], the thermodynamics of the reissnernordstrom black holes in the presence
of negative cosmological constant in various dimensions are pertinent (because of the holographic map) to the ther-
modynamics of families of eld theories found on the common worldvolume of collections of large numbers of branes
(for example m2 and d3branes), in the situation where a global background current (or its canonical conjugate
charge) has been switched on and held xed3.

geometrically this is performed by simply setting the m2 and d3branes rotating equally in each of the available
transverse orthogonal twoplanes. the higher dimensional angular momentum becomes the maxwell u (1) charge
after the kaluzaklein reduction on the (now twisted) sphere, which yields the gauged supergravity. obtaining a
pure maxwell term in this way is not possible starting with the m5brane, and so the seven dimensional einstein
maxwellantidesitter (emads7) theory denes at best a close cousin to the eld theory found on the m5branes
worldvolumes. the dual theory relevant to emads6 should be considered in a similar manner.

a truly rich phase structure for the eld theories (with transition temperatures away from t =0) is obtained only
for nite volume, which is the case we concentrate on here. our studies correspond to the study of black holes with
spherical horizons, sn1. the eld theory resides on irsn1. the case of innite volume corresponds to black holes
with horizons irn1, and to eld theory on irn. this is of course the case which comes from taking directly the near
horizon limit of explicit brane solutions.

as shown in ref. [17], the results for innite volume may be easily obtained as a scaling limit of the results of
nite volume, and so we will not discuss them here. of course, even though we are in nite volume for much of our
discussion, the thermodynamic limit is still valid here, because the dual eld theory is at large n , and a positive power
of n measures the number of degrees of freedom in the eld theory (for example, n 2 in the case of gauge theory, for
n=4 here).

the structure of the paper is as follows: in section ii we recall the charged black solutions of the einsteinmaxwell
antidesitter system. we also recall the results of performing the euclidean section and ensuring its regularity. in
section iii, we translate these results into a statement of about the relation between the thermodynamic variables of
the black hole system in thermodynamic equilibrium i.e., the equation of state. in section iv, we dene the grand
canonical and canonical thermodynamic ensembles and compute the associated gibbs and helmholtz thermodynamic
potentials, contrasting the techniques used (and results obtained) to those of our previous work. in particular, we
note that we can obtain an intrinsic denition of these quantities in euclidean quantum gravity, by sidestepping some

1see also refs. [1416] for discussion of how this extends to relating the physics of linear dilaton backgrounds to theories on
the worldvolumes of nsbranes.

of the technical subtleties encountered in the background subtraction technique for regularizing the action in
favour of the counterterm subtraction technique [21,22]. in the rest of the section, we examine the features of these
potentials quite closely, in preparation for later detailed studies. in section v, we use the equation of state and the
rst law of thermodynamics to identify the origins of the crucial features of the shape of the helmholtz potential
(free energy). this swallowtail shape is responsible for the interesting phase structure in the canonical ensemble.
section vi examines the conditions for thermodynamic stability of the black holes, examining the specic heats and
permittivity of the black holes. in this way, we identify the stable regions of the solution space of the equation of state.
we use this stability information, together with the information gained in earlier sections, to deduce the rened phase
diagrams exhibited in section vii, and some details of the phase diagrams (the slope and convexity of the coexistence
curves) are rened by using the clayperon equation in section viii.

as already stressed in this section, the thermodynamic quantities and studies performed in those sections are rooted
rmly in a microscopic description. this is ensured by the fact that we can in principle embed this entire discussion
into a complete theory of quantum gravity: string (and/or) mtheory. in practical terms, this microscopic description
the statistical mechanics underlying the thermodynamics is summarized neatly in terms of the holographically
dual eld theory. in this way, therefore we may carry our calculations further and examine the nature and magnitude
of the microscopic uctuations of the various thermodynamic quantities we have computed, knowing that we have a
description of their origin in eld theory. thus, we nd in section ix that the uctuations behave in a way consistent
with the underlying microscopic physics being supplied by the eld theory: the size of the (squared) uctuations is
controlled by a prefactor which corresponds to precisely the inverse of the number of degrees of freedom of the dual
eld theory. we observe that the size of the uctuations diverges as the system approaches a critical point in the
(q, t ) plane.

through most of the paper, we carried out our computations for the four dimensional case, in order to keep many
of our formulae simple. section x collects together some of the results for the computation of various quantities. we
stress that the qualitative structure of the physics is the same for all dimensions d4, where d=n+1. briey, we
also discuss in that same section the issue of the meaning of the formal denition of other thermodynamic ensembles
by legendre transform. it is not always the case that the thermodynamic quantities thus dened may be arrived at
by (known) computations in euclidean quantum gravity. therefore, interpretations of the physics of such ensembles
are to be taken with (at least) a pinch of salt, until such time as new technology becomes available to compute the
relevant quantities directly in quantum gravity, as we have done here for the xed potential (grand canonical) and
xed charge (canonical) ensembles.

section xi discusses the underlying structure of the phase structure of the canonical ensemble in the neighbourhood
of the critical point. in particular, the physics local to critical point is universal for all of dimensions d4. the critical
point is a second order phase transition point at the end of a coexistence line of rst order phase transitions. as such,
it has a universal description in terms of a landauginzburg model, with a quartic potential a3 in the ade
classication of such potentials. the deformation of this potential gives the classic cusp catastrophe which underlies
the critical behaviour, as is well known from the vander waalsmaxwell description of the liquidgas system, with
which our black hole physics shares many features, as originally reported in ref. [17].

in closing the introduction, we would like to stress once again how elegantly the properties of antide sitter space
yield charged black hole physics so closely akin in structure to that of ordinary eld theorylike systems, with which
we have more intuition.

from the point of view of the maxwell part of the action, the black holes are nothing more than spherical capacitors,
and as such, the amount of energy they can store grows with the charge on them, but falls with increasing hole radius.
from the point of view of the einsteinhilbert action however, the black holes store an amount of energy which grows
with radius. after a little thought, one might expect on general grounds, therefore, that there might be an interesting
phase structure resulting from a competition between these two pieces of the action.

such reasoning on its own would not be enough to genuinely ll out the whole (q, t ) phase diagram, as the equation
of state needs additional structure. it is the presence of (negative) cosmological constant which provides this nal
part: first, it provides black hole solutions which are thermally stable in ensembles involving xed temperature [13],
but secondly, as it denes a new length scale, is allows the system to distinguish, on the one hand, black holes which
are large from those which are small, and on the other hand, black holes which have small charge, from those with
large charge.

it is because of these features that the charged black hole thermodynamics has a chance to be similar to the vander
waals model of the liquidgas. recall that without the inclusion of the eects of the length scales set by nite particle
size, on the one hand, and attractive interparticle forces on the other, that system would have only the much less
interesting physics of the ideal gas: there would be no competing eects, as a function of length scale, with which to
trigger a phase transition. these basic features of ads give holography a chance to work in a way which is consistent

3

with our intuition that the microscopic physics should be modelled by ordinary eld theory.

ii. charged ads black holes

for spacetime dimension n+1, the einsteinmaxwellantidesitter (emadsn+1) action may be written as4

on the reissnernordstromantidesitter (rnads) solution may be written in static coordinates as [23,24,17]

being the cosmological constant associated with the characteristic length scale l. then the metric

ds2 = v (r)dt2 +

dr2
v (r)

+ r2d2

where d2

n1 is the metric on the round unit (n1)sphere, and the function v (r) takes the form

v (r) = 1 

m
rn2 +

q2
r2n4 +

r2
l2 .

(2)

(3)

here, m is related to the adm mass of the hole, m (appropriately generalized to geometries asymptotic to ads [25]),
as

m =

(n  1)n1

16g

m ,

where n1 is the volume of the unit (n1)sphere. the parameter q yields the charge

of the (pure electric) gauge potential, which is

q =p2(n  1)(n  2)(cid:16) n1

and  is a constant (to be xed below). if r+ is the largest real positive root of v (r), then in order for this rnads
metric to describe a charged black hole with a nonsingular horizon at r=r+, the latter must satisfy

which then xes at(r+)=0, as is required by (euclidean) regularity of the oneform potential (6) at the xed point
set of the killing vector t. the physical signicance of the quantity , which plays an important role later, is that
it is the electrostatic potential dierence between the horizon and innity.

if the inequality in eqn. (8) is saturated, the horizon is degenerate and we get an extremal black hole. this inequality

imposes a bound on the black hole mass parameter of the form mme(q, l).

in passing to the thermodynamic discussion, we dene the euclidean section (ti ) of the solution, and identify the
period, , of the imaginary time with the inverse temperature. using the usual formula for the period, =4/v (r+),
which arises from the requirement of regularity of the solution, we obtain:

this may be rewritten in terms of the potential as:

 =

4l2r+

(n  2)l2(1  c22) + nr2

+

.

(10)

(11)

for simplicity, we will specialize to n=3 (therefore working with emads4) to avoid cluttering our expressions with
complicated dependences on n. our results will remain qualitatively the same for higher n (see the comments in
section xi), and we list some of the ndependent formulae in section x. our analysis is further simplied by adopting
the following rescalings (once we have set n=3):

t 

2l
3

t ,

3
l

q 

gq ,

  

and for the various thermodynamic quantities used in ref. [17],

and

r+ 

3
l

r+ .

(12)

(13)

(14)

essentially we are introducing a system of dimensionless quantities in which everything is measured in units of the
ads scale l. this scaling is chosen so that the thermodynamic formulae still all have their standard form, i.e.,

de = t ds + dq .

df = sdt + dq

dw = sdt  qd , etc.

(15)

in the following, all of the quantities which follow are the rescaled dimensionless quantities, unless stated otherwise.

iii. equation of state

the euclidean regularity at the horizon discussed at eqn. (10) is equivalent to the condition that the black hole
is in thermodynamical equilibrium. the resulting equation (10) may therefore be written as an equation of state
t =t (, q) (analogous to t =t (p, v ) for, say, a gas at pressure p and volume v ). for n=3, one nds:

one can also solve for q as

t =

2(1  2) + q2

2q

.

(16)

(17)

from this equation of state we see that for xed  we get two branches, one for each sign, when the discriminant under
the square root is positive. for xed q, t () has three branches for q<qcrit and one for q>qcrit, where the critical

q = t   pt 2 + 2  1 .

5

charge is determined solving for the point of inection where (q/)t =(cid:0)2q/2(cid:1)t =0. in the dimensionless
units used here, one nds qcrit=1/(23), tcrit=22/3, crit=1/6, ecrit=2/3, and r+(crit)=1/2. it is useful to
plot the (, q) isotherms, i.e., plot q() for xed t , and we exhibit these in gure 1.

iv. the grand canonical and canonical ensembles

in thermodynamic parlance, the grand canonical ensemble is dened by coupling the system to energy and charge
reservoirs at xed temperature t and potential  (an intensive variable). the associated thermodynamic potential is
the gibbs free energy, w [t, ]=et sq. holding the extensive variable, q, xed, on the other hand, denes the
canonical ensemble, with its associated thermodynamic potential is the helmholtz free energy f [t, q]=et s. see
section x for a brief discussion of other ensembles.

in ref. [17], the calculation at xed potential was carried out by computing the action a la gibbonshawking. with
that technique, one must regularize the computation (as the action is formally innite) by subtracting a contribution
from a reference background which matches the solution of interest asymptotically, giving a denition of the action
relative to that of the reference spacetime. in this case it is appropriate to use ads with a xed (pure gauge)
potential at innity as the reference background.

6

remarkably ads spacetime provides for another regularization which yields an intrinsic denition of the action. in
other words, the computation makes no reference to any other solution of the equations of motion. instead, the method
[21,22] proceeds by adding a series of boundary counterterms to the action. we refer to this as the counterterm
subtraction method of dening the action, a technique tailored to spacetimes which are locally asymptotic to antide
sitter, as the counterterms are dened on the natural boundary, with which such spaces are endowed, using the ads
scale l. also note that the inclusion of additional sectors to the gravitational and cosmological parts of the action,
such as maxwell terms, does not aect the denitions and therefore we can still use the same counterterms in the
present context.

the results, using either the reference background or the counterterm subtraction methods, are identical for the
particular case in which we want to x the potential5, since it is possible to have ads space as a background solution
at arbitrary temperature and (constant) potential (but, crucially, see later). in the present notation, the answer is:

turning to the canonical (xed charge) ensemble, we wish to compute the helmholtz potential f [q, t ] (a.k.a, the
free energy). in ref. [17], where we used the reference background method to compute this, it was necessary to
compute the action using an extremal black hole as the reference background. this is because antide sitter space
with a xed charge q, as measured at innity is not a solution of the equations of motion and so is not an appropriate
background. in order to get an intrinsic denition of the action for xed charge therefore, we employ the method of
counterterm subtraction, yielding:

f [q, t ] =

1

12"3

q

(cid:19)3
 (cid:18) q

+ 9q# ,

where  is given as (q, t ) by the equation of state (17). in terms of r+, f [q, t ] may be written

f [q, t ] =

1

12(cid:20)3r+  r3

+ + 9

q2

r+(cid:21) .

(23)

(24)

as a consistency check that we have performed the computation correctly, note that this result may be obtained
from the result for the gibbs potential by formally calculating the legendre transform f [q, t ]=w [, t ]+q. when
computing f from a euclidean action, the additional q term has its origin in the boundary term introduced so
as to recover the correct variational problem from the action. it is especially satisfying to see that the counterterm
subtraction method places such intuitive relationships from equilibrium thermodynamics on a rm footing. we shall
have more to say about this in section x.

in ref. [17], where we computed the action using an extremal reference background, we obtained the following

expression for the free energy (which we denote here as f ):

f [q, t ] =

1

12"3

q

(cid:19)3
 (cid:18) q

+ 9q  4

q

e  8qe# .

(25)

note that in this case, one should consider =e as the state variable, instead of . then, the rst law is in this
case de=t ds+ dq, and e measures the energy above the extremal state. furthermore, it is with  that w [t, ] of
eqn. (21) and f [t, q] are legendre transforms of each other, as they should be. while f [q, t ] as computed in ref. [17]
using the extremal background is in no way problematic, we shall not examine it further here, as the new technology
of the counterterm subtraction method has supplied us with an intrinsic denition of the helmholtz potential, which
is the more natural legendretransform partner of the gibbs potential (21) found earlier.

we shall see that the qualitative features of the results obtained in ref. [17] for the canonical ensemble using
f [q, t ] will persist here, as the extremal background subtraction essentially redenes the absolute normalization of
some results. (the later analysis of intrinsic stability which we do in section vi would have to be somewhat modied

8

before direct comparison to the extremal subtraction results, however, as we will make heavy use of the equation of
state in terms of variables (, q, t ), and not the triple ( , q, t ) appropriate to that case.)

we now return to the analysis of the intrinsically dened helmholtz potential f [q, t ]. it was noticed in ref. [17]
that a plot of f (t ) for various values of q reveals (below a qcrit) a section of aswallowtail shape, which controls
much of the phase structure (in the canonical ensemble) discussed there, and to be discussed later here. (see gs. 5
and 6 of ref. [17] and associated text for details.) the same may be observed here for f (t ) for varying q, as shown
in gure 4.

fig. 6. plots of the helmholtz potential f [q, t ], in three dimensions, clearly showing the swallowtail shape for t >tcrit and

q<qcrit.

that such a shape appears in the thermodynamics (above tcrit or below a qcrit) can be shown to follow from the
rst law of thermodynamics, the denition of the thermodynamic potentials, and the form of the particular equations
of state which the black holes obey. we will show how this comes about next.

v. the swallow tales

the sections of swallowtails in the f (q) and f (t ) plots (above a tcrit or below a qcrit) can be seen to come from
the existence of the previously mentioned three branches of solutions to the equation of state. we have from the rst
law, and the denition of the thermodynamic potential, that df =sdt +dq. therefore, for xed t we nd

f (t ) =z (q) dq + f (t ) ,

(26)

where f (t ) is an arbitrary function of t . the integral function can be obtained by looking at the plot of isotherms.
when we have three branches (i.e., t >tcrit), the curve (q) winds back and forth in a way that the integral
describes a shape with three connected branches, constituting a section of the swallowtail shape. this can be seen
by examination of the plots of the equation of state in gure 1 and the plots of the slices f (t ) displayed in gure 46.
equation (26) is usually employed to formulate an equal area law governing the phase transitions of the system.
the latter occur at the point where the free energies of two branches, (say a and b), are equal: fa=fb. from
eqn. (26) this equality may be translated into a statement about the equality of the areas enclosed by the isotherm
curves and a line of constant q in the (, q) plane, as shown in the sketch on the left in gure 7. there is a subtlety,
though, in using eqn. (26) with the isotherm curves of eqn. (17) for t >1 (recall that isotherms with t1 go through
the origin =q=0. see gure 1.). given that the transition is governed by the equal area law, it would seem from
the curves on the right in gure 7 and the area law deduced from eqn. (26) that even for t >1, for which a minimum
value of  ceases to exist, one can always nd a phase transition point for arbitrarily large temperatures and small
enough charge. this must be wrong since it contradicts what we know about the phase transition from the curves of

6as visual dierentiation is often easier to perform than integration, we gently remind the reader that the dening relation
(f/q)t may be of use here, in conjunction with the snapshots of f (q) for xed t given in gure 5.

f for constant q, namely, that the phase transition takes place at a temperature that is smaller (or equal, at q=0)
than the hawkingpage temperature thp. (see ref. [17] and the upcoming section vii for detailed discussion of the
phase structure.)

fig. 7. the gure on the left shows how the condition for a phase transition may be interpreted in terms of an equal area
law analogous to that due to maxwell for the vander waals liquidgas model. for t 1, though, the isotherms have a very
dierent qualitative structure. the equal area law one might formulate, deducing a phase transition for arbitrarily high t >1,
for small enough q, actually is incorrect. see text for the resolution of the puzzle.

q

q

the resolution of this puzzle is instructive, and is made manifest most clearly by working in terms of the parame-

ter r+, using eqns. (19), (20) and (24). we can explicitly compute f using eqn. (26) as

f =z r+

0

(r+)(dq/dr+)dr+

(27)

to recover precisely eqn. (24). so, what is the reason that naive integration using the the equal area law yields a
dierent result?

the point is that for t >1 the function f (q) is discontinuous at q=0, where branches 2 and 3 separate (see for

example, the last plot of gure 5). for those isotherms, there is a range of values for r+, tt 21<r+<t +t 21

for which q and  become imaginary. nonetheless, the product dq is real throughout, and so is f . then, f (q)
would be a continuous function if we plotted it in the complex q plane. in performing the integration above for t >1
we have implicitly included the points where  and q are imaginary. notice that it is by including these points that
we recover sensible physics, since we want the critical line to end at q=0 at the point of the hawkingpage phase
transition. the equal area law, as it is, fails in this instance.

let us now turn to the study of the free energy for xed q. we have

in this case we need s(t ). since

f (q) = z s(t )dt + g(q)

s =

1

(cid:19)2
2(cid:18) q

=

r2
+
2

we can use the equation of state to plot s(t ) for xed q, which is shown in gure 8.

fig. 8. plots of the equation of state of s vs. t , showing isocharge lines above and below the critical charge qcrit. for
q>qcrit, there is only one branch of solutions, while for q<qcrit, there are three branches. the values of q for the isocharge
curves plotted are (top down) q=0, 0.20, qcrit, 0.45, 0.80. (the uppermost curve shows the q=0 case, which has two branches.
the central (dotted) curve is at the critical charge.

it can be readily seen that for q<qcrit we get three branches (notice that the qualitative features of the plot
of s(t ) follow from those of r+(t ) or r+() plotted in gure 3 of ref. [17], where it has a resemblance to the van der
waals p (v ) curve). a section of the swallowtail again follows7.

the astute reader may wonder why the swallowtail shape (and the resulting liquidgaslike) phase diagram occurs
in the canonical ensemble, where in addition to t , the extensive variable q is an external control parameter, and not
in the grand canonical ensemble, where the intensive variable  would be the control. this is of course what happens
in the case of the vanderwaalsmaxwell system, where the phase diagram is in (p, t ) space, and not (v, t ) space
[26,27]. the swallowtail shapes occur there in the gibbs potential. it is now hopefully clear that the answer follows
from the fact that our equation of state yields three branches of solutions for the intensive variable  (or t) as a
function of the xed extensive variable q (or s), as can be seen by examining the curves displayed in gs. 1 and 8.

that there are no swallowtail shapes in any of the other ensembles follows from the fact that no more than two

branches occur for the equation of state written in terms of other variables.

vi. intrinsic stability

given that we have the full power of the thermodynamic framework at our disposal, (thanks to the stabilizing
inuence of a negative cosmological constant), it is interesting to consider the thermodynamic stability of our various
solutions against microscopic uctuations8. notice that one can always formally compute the relevant macroscopic
quantities (like specic heats, etc.,) which we discuss here, without any reference to an underlying microscopic descrip-
tion. this has been done in the context of black hole thermodynamics since time immemorial. the dierence here
is that we know the nature of the microscopic degrees of freedom which supply the underlying statistical mechanics
which gives rise to these macroscopic thermodynamics quantities. the underlying physics is that of the gauge theory

7again, one can use gure 8 to reconstruct f (q) visually using the integral relation, or one may use the denition of the

entropy s(f/t )q to reconstruct gure 8 from gure 4.
8see refs. [28,29] for analyses which overlap with those presented here, in a similar context.

13

to which this system is holographically dual, which in turn is the physics of coincident branes. this will become more
apparent in section ix when we explicitly study the uctuations themselves.

thermodynamic stability may be phrased in many dierent ways [30,31], depending on which thermodynamic
function we choose to use, and how obscure we are attempting to seem. for example, it can be seen as minimization
of the energy, e, as a function of (s, q), or maximization of the entropy s, as a function of (e, q), etc. in any case,
one is considering an innitesimal variation of the state function away from equilibrium. the rst law (15) will ensure
that the rst order terms vanish. stability is then a statement about the second order variations. generally then
the stability conditions are phrased in terms of the restriction that the hessian of the state function is positive (or
negative, depending on the context) semidenite.

an equivalent but physically more transparent way of writing the stability conditions is in terms of specic heats

and other compressibilities, to wit:

cq  t (cid:18) s

t(cid:19)q  0, c  t (cid:18) s

t(cid:19)  0,

t (cid:18) q

(cid:19)t  0 .

(30)

the rst two, the specic heats at constant electric charge and potential, are familiar analogues of the specic heats
at constant volume and pressure in uid systems. in the case in hand, they determine the thermal stability of the
black holes, indicating whether a thermal uctuation results in an increase or decrease in the size of the black hole.
(this follows from the fact that the entropy is proportional to the size of the black hole,.) stability follows from c0,
given the fact that black holes radiate at higher temperatures when they are smaller.

the last quantity, t , has the following physical interpretation.

it is negative if the black hole is electrically
unstable to electrical uctuations (if they are possible, see later discussion). this happens if the potential of the black
hole decreases as a result of placing more charge on it. the potential should of course increase, in an attempt to
make it harder to move the system from equilibrium9. t therefore deserves to be called the isothermal (relative)
permittivity of the black hole.

there are of course other interesting response functions for the system, such as the adiabatic permittivity,
(q/)s or the quantity analogous to the coecient of thermal expansion in liquidgas systems, =(q/t ),
which are not all independent. the ones which we have discussed above will suce for the physics that we study in
this paper.

we may examine the plots of the isotherms in gure 1 and deduce that the negatively sloped branches are electrically
unstable if there are electrical uctuations possible. similarly, we may deduce that the negatively sloped branches of
the (s, t ) isocharge curves in gure 8, are thermally unstable, and so on.

stability follows, equivalently, from the concavity/convexity of the plots of f and w as functions of t . in fact, the

specic heat conditions are equivalent to

whereas the permittivity condition is

(cid:18) 2f
t 2(cid:19)q  0 and (cid:18) 2w

t 2 (cid:19)  0 ,

(cid:18) 2f
q2(cid:19)t  0,

or (cid:18) 2w

2 (cid:19)t  0 .

(31)

(32)

by examining the isotherms displayed in gure 1, we see that there are a number of features in the (q, t ) plane
which govern electrical stability. generically, let us describe the three branches of an isotherm as follows: we call
branch 3 the branch of solutions which extends all the way from q=, terminating where dq/d=0. from there,
branch 2 takes over, terminating where again dq/d=0. the isotherm continues with branch 1 until the point
q=0, =1 is reached. this terminology matches that of ref. [17].

from this denition, then, branch 3 is electrically stable for most of its extent, except for a small region near the
join with branch 2. in this case, before reaching the point where dq/d=0 the permittivity changes sign at a point
where dq/d= and renders branch 3 electrically unstable thereafter. this is a feature that is absent from the

9this follows from common sense, or more formally, le chateliers principle.

14

standard vanderwaalsmaxwell system (in the latter there are no points in the isotherms where dp/dv = ), and
which will introduce a signicant modication of the phase diagram.

branch 2, being between two places where dq/d=0, has positive denite slope and hence is electrically stable
everywhere, while branch 1 is electrically unstable everywhere, having negative denite slope. to compute precisely
where the electrical instability begins, we need only nd the location of the minimum of the isotherms, that is, the

above mentioned point where dq/d=, which is given by the equation q=t1t 2. with the segment of the

t axis from 0 to 1, this forms a region in the (q, t ) plane within which branch 3 and branch 1 are unstable to electric
uctuations. branch 2 is electrically stable everywhere, as mentioned before, but as already pointed out in ref. [17],
and as a quick examination of the gure 8 of the isocharge (s, t ) curves reveals, branch 2 is unstable to thermal
uctuations, and so never plays a role in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles.

it is also entertaining to subject by eye the snapshots of f and w taken in gures 3, 4 and 5 to the convexity and
concavity conditions (31) and (32). we nd that the shapes of f and w do indeed conrm our conclusions about the
stability of the various branches.

it is very instructive to plot the boundaries of the various branches in the (q, t ) plane:

lie inside the solid curved line are unstable to electric uctuations. branch 2 is electrically stable but thermally unstable
everywhere.

it is particularly interesting to note that the gures in the previous plot are simply the three sheets of an underlying
cusp catastrophe shape, as can be seen by assembling them in three dimensions to reconstruct the equation of state
in gure 1. indeed, it is highly instructive to align the surface (q, t ) describing equation of state and the surface
f [q, t ] giving the swallowtail shape of the free energy, in such a way as to project some of their important features
to the (q, t ) plane, as done in gure 10. this gives rise to the critical phase diagram which we will discuss in the
next section.

as anticipated, the shape formed by the equation of state in the neighbourhood of the critical point is merely a
distortion of the standard cusp shape, which was encountered in the variables (r+, q, ) in our previous paper [17].
figure 11 shows this standard shape with two sample trajectories in state space.
it will be discussed further in
section xi.

encountering a phase transition, the other (q>qcrit) does not. the precise location of the line across which the transition
happens is given by the minimum free energy condition, or equivalently, an appropriately formulated equal area law.

as a nal comment that in cases where one of the local stability criteria (30) are violated, we are not always able
to determine the stable ground state. however, the precise nature of the stability violation is providing information
about how the system will relax to a new stable conguration. for example, one has 2et q2 and so t <0
indicates that the black hole should relax by reducing its charge, i.e., it will emit charged particles (if possible).

vii. phase structure

figures 10 and 6, together with the slices displayed in gures 4 and 5, show how the free energy curve determines
the phase structure of the black holes as one moves around on the state curve in the canonical ensemble, while gures 2
and the slices displayed in gure 3 determine the phase diagram for the grand canonical ensemble. we performed
this analysis in ref. [17], and we recall it here for completeness, before going on to rene the resulting phase diagram
using the information uncovered in this paper.

the dashed line in the (q, t ) plane shows the boundary of the region multiply covered by , in the state curve,
and correspondingly, the free energy has three possible values in that region also (see g. 10), which constitutes the
swallowtail region. the free energy of branch 2 is always greater than that of either branches 1 or 3, however, and
so there is no transition along the dashed lines. along the solid line, the free energies of branches 1 and 3 are equal,
and there is a rst order phase transition (the rst derivative of the free energy is discontinuous) along this line.
also note that the one dimensional q=0 situation is the familiar hawkingpage transition [13] between ads and

adsschwarzschild, which happens (in our units) at t =thp =2/31.154, for n=3.

the solid line is the coexistence curve of the two phase of allowed black hole. the line ends in a critical point.
above this point, there is no transition, and one goes from large to small black holes continuously (the distinction
between branch 1 and branch 3 is removed). (the reader should compare this to the physics of the liquidgas system
for an exact analogue in classic thermodynamics.) as the rst derivative (but not the second) of the free energy f is
continuous at the critical point, there is a second order phase transition there, about which we will have some more
to say in sections ix and xi.

this physics is all summarized in gure 12, where we have also displayed the phase diagram in the grand canonical
ensemble (the (, t ) plane), which is straightforward to determine. some of the details of the shape of these curves
will be conrmed by calculations in section viii. for most of the rest of the paper, we will not have much more to say
about the phase diagram in the (, t ) plane, and refer the reader to ref. [17] for discussions of its features10. note,

10discussed in ref. [17], for example is the issue of the line of extremal black holes for t =0 and >1. the calculation of
w [t, ] yields a nonzero result on this line, which is the contribution from the extremal black holes. we expect that this
does not represent the equilibrium situation, because they will decay due to superradiance eects on the approach to zero

17

however, that the boundary in this gure marks the line where the gibbs free energy of the black holes equals that
of ads. that is the boundary does not denote a curve where one of the local stability criteria begins to be violated.

depending upon the situation, there may or may not be the possibility of electrical uctuations. this depends
very much upon the setting within which we are considering these black holes. in a theory without charged particles,
the black hole charge would be xed and electrical stability need not be considered. in general, however, if there are
fundamental charged quanta in the theory, then there is the possibility of the black holes emitting or absorbing such
quanta, introducing the possibility of electrical uctuations. such a possibility must be considered in (for example)
the case when the emads system is considered to be a kaluzaklein truncation of some higher dimensional theory,
as discussed in our previous work [17]. then, the electrically charged black hole can in principle emit or absorb
electrically charged kaluzaklein particles in order to allow its charge to uctuate.

in the particular case of four dimensions, however, there is also the possibility that we can exchange, by electric
magnetic duality, the electric charge (and vector potential) that we have been considering here for a magnetic charge
(and vector potential). in this case, we have instead that the only way for the magnetically charged black holes to
change their charge is to emit or absorb kaluzaklein monopoles, which are not fundamental quanta, as they are
very massive, the further we are below the kaluzaklein scale.

in general, when there are allowed electrical uctuations (by whatever mechanism is appropriate to the situation
in hand) we must also take into account on the phase diagram, the electrical stability of the solutions as determined
in the previous section. including those regions, we obtain the following phase diagram:

temperature, as the charge in them is not xed in this ensemble. this is an artifact of the failure of the euclidean quantum
gravity techniques that we have used to take into account such processes.

the question arises as to what the equilibrium system is which resides in the shaded regions. the electrically
unstable black holes cannot reside there, and so we must search for other possibilities. one formal possibility is that
extremal black holes reside there, because formally they can exist at any temperature for any charge. however, we do
not nd this possibility very attractive. we expect that the permission that the euclidean computation appears to give
them to exist at any temperature is an artifact, and that they should naturally be associated with zero temperature,
in which case they can only occupy the line t =0 on our phase diagram in the canonical ensemble, which they do.
in any event, one can infer from the calculations of ref. [17] that extremal black holes actually have a higher free
energy than the unstable nonextremal black holes. another possibility is that the preferred state is simply antide
sitter space (which can also exist at arbitrary temperature) lled with a charged gas. this is certainly the case at
q=0 [11,13]. however, when the gas carries a nonnegligible charge (and hence mass), its backreaction on the ads
geometry can not be neglected in determining the free energy. another interesting possibility is that of black hole
surrounded by a gas of particles. again, if the gas component carries a sizable fraction of the charge and mass, its
backreaction on the geometry would modify the equation of state and may then reestablish thermodynamic stability.
pursuing either of these possibilities lies beyond the scope of the present paper, and so we will leave settling of this
interesting issue to a future date. hence we must simply regard the shaded region as a sort of terra incognita with
regard to black hole physics. as a nal note, we remind the reader that this is only the region in which we are certain
that the black holes do not minimize the free energy due to its thermodynamic instability. it may be that the onset
of a phase transition to a state of lower free energy actually occurs outside of the boundary in gure 13, just as it
does for the grand canonical ensemble in gure 12.

viii. coexistence of phases and the clapeyron equation

let us study further the coexistence lines which we discovered in the phase diagrams, both in the canonical ensemble
and in the grand canonical ensemble (see gure 12). we can use straightforward thermodynamics to determine the
shape of the lines.

let us start with the grand canonical ensemble, with gibbs potential w [, t ], with dw =sdtqd. an equation
can be derived for the line separating two phases a and b in the (, t ) phase diagram as follows. along such a
coexistence line the phases (for given (, t )) have the same w , and so the slope of the curve q(t ) is related to the
change in entropy and q by:

in the case at hand, one of the phases is ads which has zero entropy and zero charge. so we nd that (for all n):

d
dt

= 

sa  sb
qa  qb

n1
n2

.

(34)

here, q(t, ) is obtained from the equation of state for the corresponding branch. equation (34) is the precise
analogue of the clapeyron equation. from it, we see that the slope of the curve is negative. for the case of n=3 we
can give explicit expressions. in the rescaled units, we have:

d

1

2  t



+r t 2

2 + 1 

1

2! .

(35)

we see from here that the curve intersects the axes orthogonally, and its convexity, sketched in the gure 12, follows
from the fact that d2/dt 2<0.

next (assuming the issue of electrical stability can be ignored), we consider the canonical ensemble, dened by the
helmholtz thermodynamic potential f [q, t ], with df =sdtdq. along any line of coexistence of two phases, we
have:

dq
dt

=

sa  sb
a  b

(36)

the phase diagram is sketched in gure 12.

the clapeyron equation can be used to nd the slope of the curve at q=0 and q=qcrit for the line separating the

two black holes phases (we show the expressions for all n):

=

dq

dt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)q=0

(where we have used here that rn2
+(1)  q near q = 0, as is easy to obtain). on the scale at which we have sketched the
coexistence curve in the previous section, it is essentially a straight line, and we have drawn it as such in gure 12.

ix. fluctuations for charged ads black holes

in section vi, we discussed and computed the thermodynamic quantities (specic heats and permitivity) which
signal the stability (or not) of a black hole against uctuations. while these quantities pertain to the response of the
system to macroscopic thermodynamic processes which may be performed, in euclidean quantum gravity, where we
ordinarily do not have a description of the microscopic degrees of freedom, we usually cannot relate them directly to
microscopic uctuations, as we can in ordinary thermal physics.

however, we can go further in this paper. many of the ads models which we have here can be embedded into a full
theory of quantum gravity string and/or mtheory and where the holographic duality tells us precisely that the
microscopic description is organized neatly in terms of a dual (gauge) eld theory.

so we may go and boldly study the uctuations of the thermodynamic quantities in our theory, and we should see

earmarks of the underlying (gauge) theory in our quantities, connecting the microscopic to the macroscopic.

here, one uses the entropy to dene a probability distribution on the space of independent thermodynamic quan-
tites [31]: p(xi) exp(s(xi)). with the assumption that uctuations are small, we can work with a quadratic
expansion of the entropy in deviations from the equilibrium values. the stability analysis of section vi establishes
that the hessian of s is negative semidenite, and so we have a normalizable gaussian distribution within this
approximation. one then nds that the uctuations are given by

hxi xki = (cid:18) 2s

xixk(cid:19)1

20

(39)

where xi denotes the deviation of xi from its equilibrium value, and notation of the lefthand side denotes a matrix
inverse.

implicit above is the assumption that we have a closed system can be divided into a number of subsystems. in
the ads context, the natural decomposition is the black hole and the thermodynamic reservoirs11. in this situation
where the subsystem of interest is really the entire object under study, the most reasonable approach is to consider
uctuations in only the extensive variables that are free to vary in the thermodynamic ensemble [30]. hence we denote
the general extensive variables that are free to vary as xi, and the fis are their conjugate intensive variables dened
by ds=fk dxk. eqn. (39) then becomes [30,31]

hxi xki = 

xi
fk

= 

xk
fi

.

(40)

now, these uctuations are given practical meaning when they are compared to for example, their equilibrium

values. for example, the relative root mean square of the uctuations:

phx 2
i i

xi

(41)

which tells us about the sharpness of the distribution in xi.

note, that by the formula (40) the above ratio goes roughly as the extensive parameters to the 1/2, and therefore

the distribution is increasingly sharp as the size of the system increases.

now in the present problem of charged black holes,

hence for the canonical (xed q) ensemble (our analogue of a xed volume system), the only free extensive variable
is the energy, and the above formulae yield

ds = (1/t )de  (/t )dq .

(42)

he2i = (cid:18) e

(cid:19)q

= t 2(cid:18) e

t(cid:19)q

= t cq .

(43)

for the grand canonical (xed ) ensemble (analogue of a xed pressure system), the energy and the charge are free
to vary, and one has

he2i = (cid:18) e

(cid:19)/t

= t 2(cid:18) e
= t c + t (cid:18) e
(cid:19)t

t(cid:19)/t

.

= t t .

hq2i = t (cid:18) q
(cid:19)t
he qi = t (cid:18) e
(cid:19)t
t(cid:19)
= t 2(cid:18) q

(cid:19)t
+ t (cid:18) q

= t 2 + t t .

(44)

(45)

(46)

we have recovered the fact that the thermodynamic uctuations are controlled by the same generalized compressibil-
ities specic heats permittivity, etc., that determine the intrinsic stability in section vi. this follows since both
analyses can be phrased in terms of the hessian of the entropy.

above we have presented a general thermodynamic discussion. let us now focus on the case n=3 and present our
results in terms of the dimensionless variables introduced in section i. note that translating the above thermodynamic
formulae to the dimensionless variables, there are extra factors, giving e.g.,

11we are neglecting the contributions of any gas component around the black hole in all of our calculations in this paper.
further we should be able to consider smaller subdivisions with the dual eld theory in mind.

notice that all of these results are proportional to g/l2n 3/2, so for large n the uctuations are suppressed.
for n=3, the dual eld theory (supplying our microscopic description) is the eld theory of ref. [32], associated to n
coincident m2branes. the number of degrees of freedom in this theory grows as n 3/2 (as seen for example in the
black hole entropy at high temperature). so the squared uctuations are controlled by the inverse of the number of
degrees of freedom of the eld theory, which is precisely what we expect from standard kinetic theory connecting the
microscopic to the macroscopic! note here that we see these unconned degrees of freedom appearing in our formulae
at arbitrary temperature in this ensemble. this is because black holes dominate the thermodynamics for all values
of the temperature: the presence of charge eects a deconnement of the theory at all temperatures, even in nite
volume. (this is to be contrasted to the case of q=0, where ads dominates the physics for some t <thp, representing
the conned phase.)

to gain more insight into these results, let us rewrite eqn. (47) for the energy uctuations as:

he2i
e2 =

3g
2l2

t 3

r2

+(cid:17)2
+(cid:16)t + q

r3

1

(cid:16) t
r+(cid:17)q

(52)

from this form, one can pick out some of the interesting behaviour. the uctuations go to zero at zero temperature
as t 3. for large t (and hence large e), the uctuations also go to zero now as 1/t (since for large r+, 2tr+). an
interesting factor is (t /r+)1 which can change sign for q<qcrit=1/(23).

so for q>qcrit, the uctuations rise from zero at the extremal black (t =0) go through a maximum and then die
down for large temperatures. as q approaches qcrit, the maximum grows larger and larger, and actually becomes a
divergence at q=qcrit! (we have plotted these squared uctuations in gure 14, where they are denoted f (t ).) this
is actually the same divergence as that in cq at the critical point, which was commented on in ref [17]. hence one
nds from there that near the critical point,

q plotted here are (bottom up) q=0.49, 0.44, 0.39, 0.34, qcrit. the dotted curve shows that the uctuations diverge at q=qcrit,
at the critical temperature t =tcrit.

this divergence of the energy uctuations signals the breakdown of the gaussian approximation considered in these
calculations. it is also the classic behaviour of a second order phase transition point, where correlation lengths, etc.,
diverge as an order parameter vanishes. here, the order parameter can be taken to be a homogenous function of
r+(3)r+(1), the dierence between horizon radii of the branches 3 and 1.
for q<qcrit, the uctuations rise from zero at the extremal black hole and diverge at the rst zero of t /r+.
between the two zeros of t /r+, he2i/e2 is negative. this is simply an indication that we are in the thermally
unstable regime, otherwise known as branch 2. for t larger than the second zero of t /r+, the uctuations are
monotonically decreasing (from innity at the zero, to zero as t  ). as we know from the minimum free energy
condition, we are protected from the unstable regime by making a phase transition from branch 1 and 3. so in a
he2i/e2 versus t plot, the uctuations rise from zero to the phase transition point and the (discontinuously) jump
to the decreasing curve.

x. of higher dimensions and other thermodynamic functions and ensembles

in this section, we collect together some results for various thermodynamic quantities computed for arbitrary n,
with all of the factors explicitly included. the thermodynamic functions are written in terms of their canonical state
variables. we do not use the physical charge q instead of q, for simplicity of presentation. in any expression, q may
be restored by recalling that

similarly, we also introduce the parameter s as

q =

n1
8g

(n  1)cq

and c =r 2(n  2)
n  1

.

s =

n1
4g

s .

(54)

(55)

notice that it does make sense to write physical quantities in terms of q and s, since they are related to the charge
and entropy densities. this follows from the fact that we may replace ln1n1 by the eld theorys volume vn1.

(58)

where q=q(t, ) is obtained from the equation of state. notice that w [t, ] vanishes for antide sitter spacetime
(which has q=0), and so ads may be thought of as the reference background for the calculation of the action, and
indeed w [t, ] was computed in this way in ref. [17], using the background subtraction method, which we see (in the
present work) gives the same result as the intrinsic denition by counterterm subtraction methods.

the helmholtz free energy which is the legendre transform of w [t, ] may be computed with an explicit action
calculation, using the counterterm subtraction method to give an intrinsic (backgroundless) denition. the result
is:

f [t, q] =

c (cid:16) q
c(cid:17)

(59)

again, =(t, q) is obtained from the equation of state. notice that ads with with nonzero charge is not a
solution of the equations of motion and so cannot be considered as the ground state or reference background for
this result. indeed, this result cannot be obtained by an action calculation which uses a matching to a background,
precisely for this reason. the counterterm subtraction technique is therefore necessary here to supply the honest
action computation for this thermodynamic potential. it is satisfying to note that w [t, ] and f [t, q] are legendre
transforms of each other, w =f +q, as they should be.

we can arrive at a variety of other ensembles, with their corresponding associated potentials, by formal legendre
transforms. for example, we can consider the enthalpy h[s, ], a function of entropy and potential (this notation is
not to be confused with the hamiltonian!). starting from w [t, ] we can construct h=w +t s, nding

h[s, ] =

(n  1)n1

16gl2

hs

n

n1 + l2s

n2

n1 (1  c22)i .

(60)

notice that this function can not be obtained by performing a proper background subtraction in euclidean gravity,
since for any given solution we cannot nd another regular solution with the same values of the entropy and the
potential. however, the enthalpy vanishes for ads, which could therefore be regarded as the ground state or reference
background here.

another thermodynamic function in terms of its canonical variables is the (internal) energy e=w +t s+q,

e[s, q] =

(n  1)n1

16gl2

hs

n

n1 + l2s

n2

n1 + q2l2s

(61)

which vanishes as well for ads. this function would dene the thermodynamic potential for the microcanonical
ensemble, and as for the enthalpy above, a calculation from euclidean gravity should proceed by xing the entropy
of the statethe black hole area, if we neglect the entropy of the charged gas in ads12.

xi. the universal neighbourhood of the critical point

in the section ix, we saw that uctuations diverge as we approach the critical point in the canonical ensemble. this
point represents a second order phase transition, as can be seen from the fact that the free energys rst derivative
ceases to have a discontinuity there (see gures 4 and 5 for visual conrmation), while the divergences of the last
section signals a discontinuity in the second derivative.

while much of the detailed discussion of the paper has been for n=3, we emphasize here again that the results
extend to all n>2. this is most clearly seen from the important features of the equation of state. let us examine
some of these more closely.

consider equation (10). originating as the condition for euclidean regularity, and hence thermodynamic equilib-
rium, the qualitative features of (r+) for varying q are shown in gure 15. these features are the same for all n:
there is a critical charge, qcrit, below which there are three solutions for r+ for a range of values of , corresponding
to the small (branch 1), branch 2, and large (branch 3) black holes, in the language of ref. [17], and in this paper.

critical value of the charge, qcrit, below which multiple branches of r+ solutions appear. the neighbourhood of the critical
point is a universal cubic, true for all dimensions.

that this shape persists for arbitrary n can be seen as follows. first, note that for large r+, (r+) goes as 1/r+.
secondly, note that the denominator of the right hand side of eqn. (10) after choosing scalings similar to those done
for n=3 at the beginning of section iii, is13

which has a single positive root, re, where  diverges. this corresponds to the t =0 situation, and re is the radius of
the corresponding extremal black hole. given the above, any turning points for nite r+ must come in pairs, and the
condition /r+=0 shows that there are only two real, positive such solutions, which we call r+(1) and r+(3), labeling
where branch 1 ends and, respectively, where branch 3 begins. branch 2 lies between these roots. the equations
determining those roots also have an elegant form (for the same rescaling as before):

the two roots coalesce at the critical point (i.e., 2/r2

of this critical black hole is r+(crit) and it is at (inverse) temperature crit. for example,

+=0 also) where q=qcrit. the value of the radius

the quantities {qcrit, r+(crit), crit} take the values {1/12, 1/2, 3/(22)}, while for n=4, they have the values
{2/135,p(2/3), 5/(46)}. the basic point here is that while the critical values themselves vary, the important

structures do not depend upon n in any essential way.

the neighbourhood of the critical point is extremely interesting. because of the fact that for all n, there at most
two turning points below qcrit, it is clear that this neighbourhood can be better written as a cubic, in terms of local
coordinates near the point. to this end, write =r+r+(crit), =crit, and q=qqcrit, and rewrite the equation of
state in these coordinates. the neighbourhood of the critical point is found by taking these coordinates (, , q) to
be small.

note that the quadratic and linear terms vanish with at the approach to the critical temperature 0, and the term
which contains 3 does not vanish in this way, and so we neglect higher powers of  in favour of this one in order
to study the nearcritical behaviour. here, and in what follows, we will also neglect terms which are not linear in q
and . this cubic form (64) may always be obtained in this limit for all n, because of the observations made in the
preceding few paragraphs. from this, certain universal behaviour can be easily deduced, such as the critical exponent
characterizing how fast our order parameter, , vanishes. (recall that  represents the dierence in equilibrium
radius between the black holes of branch 1 and that of branch 3; it measures the distance from the analogue of the
uid phase in liquidgas language, where the two forms are indistinguishable.) setting =0, we see that the critical
exponent is 1

performing this computation for other n will change the numerical prefactor, but not the exponent, which in this
sense deserves to be called universal.

that a cubic equation controls the phase structure can be traced back a step further. first, notice that the three
dimensional plot of the curve in (, r+, q) space is the cusp catastrophe, as drawn in gure 11, with some sample
state space trajectories. we can remove the quadratic term in our cubic polynomial by shifting  by an appropriate
amount. multiplying overall by a normalizing factor, our cubic may be written as:

0 = 3 + a + b ,

with a  42  and b

where we have discarded an arbitrary additive constant. treated as a potential, (for reasons which will be clear below),
it is the generic form of v() as a and b vary that controls much of the critical behaviour in the neighbourhood of
the critical point. (as a and b are functions of q and t , this critical behaviour in (a, b) space translates directly
into the earlier discussed critical behaviour in (q, t ) space.)

the function v() deserves to be treated an eective potential which organizes the description of much of the local
in particular, away from the critical point, where a and b are both nonzero, the potential generically
physics.
has two minima and one maximum, the location of which are given by the solutions of our universal cubic. these
locations may be smoothly visualized in the form of the cusp, sketched in gure 11. the location of the minima in 
are the values r+(1) and r+(3), of the equilibrium black hole radii of branch 1 and branch 3, while the location of the
maximum is r+(2), the branch 2 black hole radius. the thermal stability of the branches correlates with the whether
the turning point is a maximum or a minimum of v(), further justifying its treatment as a potential.

the boundary of the region where there are three solutions marks the situation where one of the minima of the
potential v() merges with the maximum and disappears. this boundary is simply given by the values of a and b

26

where the cubics discriminant, =27b2+4a3, vanishes. (this can only happen for a<0, therefore telling us that we
have the distinct branches below crit.) the interior of this region may be translated into (q, t ) space, where it gives
the shaded region in the third diagram of gure 9 where branch 2 resides.

along the line in the (q, ) plane (or the (q, t ) plane) where b vanishes, given by q=p(32/27) , the two minima
of the potential v() are degenerate. this is the point at which there is phase transition, as the system moves from
one minimum of the potential to the other.

at the critical point, (a=0, b=0), the maximum and the two minima merge into a single minimum of the potential.
notice that the well formed by the potential is very at there, and so the range of allowed uctuations within it is
larger at this point than at any other point in the plane, as they are less conned. we have seen this physics before
as the divergence of the uctuations of the microscopic degrees of freedom at the critical point. the potential v()
is an eective potential for the uncharged microscopic degrees of freedom of the theory in the neighbourhood of the
critical point. (see gure 16 for a summary of these critical points of the potential.)

fig. 16. the behaviour of the landauginzburg a3 potential at various points in the (a, b) plane. this plane maps to
the (q, t ) plane of the charged black holes system. the line (a<0, b=0), maps to the critical coexistence line found in that
system.

also, in this language, the meaning of the swallowtail shape for the thermodynamic potential f [q, t ] is now clear:
it is simply the actual value of the potential v(; , q) at its maxima and minima: the critical line is the place where
these two values at the minima are equal, the place where v has degenerate minima.
this function v() is the a3 landauginzburg potential. the eective landauginzburg theory which we can
write here is an eective theory of the uncharged microscopic degrees of freedom underlying the thermodynamics.
kinetic terms to complete the landauginzburg model would have their origins in the holographically dual eld
theory. one can in principle derive additional potential terms governing the charged degrees of freedom as well, in
order to model the stability structure uncovered in section vi, but we will not do that here.

in the language of catastrophe theory [18], the term 4 is the basic germ of the cusp catastrophe, and a and b
are the unfolding parameters which deform the potential, giving a line of rst order phase transition points along
the line (b=0, a<0) where its mimima are degenerate. the (ade) classication of such potentials is isomorphic to
that of certain geometrical singularities [34]. we cannot help but wonder if this story marks the beginning of a richer
tale involving a more profound underlying geometrical structure into which this physics is all embedded. as all of the
physics of this paper is intimately connected to the physics of branes, perhaps the possibility of such a connection
should be pursued.
