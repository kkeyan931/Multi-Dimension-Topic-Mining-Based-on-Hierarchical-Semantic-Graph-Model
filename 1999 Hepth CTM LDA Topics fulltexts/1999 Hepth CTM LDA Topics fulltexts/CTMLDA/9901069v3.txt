abstract

it is well known that, in the rst-order formalism, pure three-dimensional
gravity is just the bf theory. similarly, four-dimensional general relativity
can be formulated as bf theory with an additional constraint term added to
the lagrangian. in this paper we show that the same is true also for higher-
dimensional einstein gravity:
in any dimension gravity can be described as
a constrained bf theory. moreover, in any dimension these constraints are
quadratic in the b eld. after describing in details the structure of these
constraints, we scketch the spin foam quantization of these theories, which
proves to be quite similar to the spin foam quantization of general relativity
in three and four dimensions. in particular, in any dimension, we solve the
quantum constraints and nd the so-called simple representations and inter-
twiners. these exhibit a simple and beautiful structure that is common to all
dimensions.

i. introduction

in three spacetime dimensions einsteins general relativity becomes a beautiful and sim-
ple theory. there are no local degrees of freedom, and gravity is an example of topological
eld theory. owing to this fact, a variety of techniques from tqft can be used, and a great
deal is known about quantization of the theory. more precisely, when written in the rst
order formalism, three-dimensional gravity is just the bf theory, whose action is given by:

sbf = zm

tr(b  f ).

(1)

here m is the spacetime manifold, f is the curvature of the spin connection, and b is the
frame eld one-form. the trace is taken in the lie algebra of the relevant gauge group,
which in the case of 3d is given by so(2, 1) for lorentzian spacetimes and by so(3) in the
euclidean case. the quantization of bf theory is well-understood, both canonically and by
the path integral method, at least in the euclidean case. this is one of the possible ways
to construct quantum gravity in three spacetime dimensions: it exists as a topological eld
theory.1

it is tempting to apply the beautiful quantization methods from tqft to other, more
complicated theories, including those with local degrees of freedom. an interesting proposal
along these lines was made in a series of papers by martellini and collaborators [2], who
proposed to treat yang-mills theory as a certain deformation of the bf theory. this gives
an interesting picture of the conning phase of yang-mills theory.

recently, a proposal was made suggesting a way to apply the ideas and methods from
tqft to four-dimensional gravity. the new approach to quantum gravity, for which the
name spin foam approach was proposed in [3], lies on the intersection between tqft and
loop quantum gravity (see [4] for a recent review on loop gravity). as it was advocated
by rovelli and reisenberger [5], the results of the loop approach suggest a possibility of
constructing the partition function of 4d gravity as a spin foam model. the rst spin
foam model of 4d gravity was constructed by reisenberger [6], and was intimately related
to the self-dual canonical (loop) quantum gravity. later, barrett, crane [7] and baez [3]
proposed another model based on the study of the geometry of a 4-simplex. both spin foam
models deeply use the fact that einsteins theory in four dimensions can be rewritten as a
bf theory with additional quadratic constraints. it is a constrained su(2) bf theory [8,9]
in the self-dual case, and a constrained so(4) bf theory [10] for the barrett, baez and
crane model. in both cases, the resulting quantum model is given by a certain deformation
of the topological bf theory.

while the approach of martellini et al. [2], which treats yang-mills theory as a deforma-
tion of the bf theory, is clearly not limited to any spacetime dimension, one might suspect
that the similar strategy in the case of gravity works only in three and four dimensions.

1let us note, however, that there are subtle problems with large gauge transformations and
degenerate metrics in this theory, which, to our knowledge, are not yet resolved in a completely
satisfactory manner. see, for instance, [1] for a discussion of these issues.

2

indeed, it is believed that in order to quantize a theory in a way similar to the one used
in tqft, the theory must at least have the property that its phase space consists of pairs
connection  conjugate electric eld. however, already in the case of four dimensions, the
fact that the gravitational phase space can be brought to the yang-mills form is quite non-
trivial. in order to arrive to such a formulation one uses crucially the self-duality available in
four dimensions [11]. thus, one might suspect that the quantization techniques from tqft
that use the connection eld as the main variable are limited only to gravity in three and
four dimensions.

there is, however, one case that seems to contradict this negative conclusion: the case
of the usual so(4) rst-order formulation of gravity in four dimensions. as we have men-
tioned above, this model can be written as a so(4) bf theory with additional constraints
guaranteeing that the b eld comes from the frame eld. this formulation serves as the
starting point for the quantum model of barrett, baez and crane, which does treat this
theory as a deformation of the bf theory. on the other hand, the canonical formulation of
this theory is known to contain second class constraints, solving which one does not seem
to arrive to a phase space of the yang-mills type [12]. thus, this theory provides us with a
puzzle: on one hand, treating it covariantly as bf theory with constraints one can quantize
it as a deformation of the topological bf theory, on the other hand one does not expect the
methods from tqft to work because the phase space of this theory is not that simple as
that of yang-mills theory. while we do not know any simple resolution of this puzzle, it
seems from details of the quantum theory that it uses the self-duality in some clever way and
thus goes around the problem with the second class constraints of the canonical formulation.
this fact, yet to be understood in full details, opens door to a possibility of applying
the topological quantization procedure to gravity theories in higher dimensions, hoping
that the covariant quantization will be able to go around the problem with second class
constraints that are known to be present also in this case. the rst step that one has to
take towards this goal is to reformulate a higher dimensional gravity theory as a bf theory
with constraints. the main aim of this paper is to show that such a formulation is indeed
possible. in the second part of the paper we shall study in some details the corresponding
spin foam quantum theory.

our results can be summarized as follows. first, in section ii, we show that in any
dimension gravity can be written as an so(d), or so(d  1, 1), bf theory subjects to
quadratic, non-derivative constraints on the b eld. namely we prove that gravity in d
dimensions can be described by the following action functional:

s[a, b, ] = zm

tr(b  f ) +

1
2

tr(b  (b)).

(2)

here a is an so(d) -for spacetime of euclidean signature, or so(d  1, 1) for spacetime of
minkowskian signature- connection eld. the b eld is a lie algebra valued (d  2)-form
and  is a lagrange multiplier eld that can be contracted in a special way (see below)
with the (d  2)-form b to produce a lie-algebra valued 2-form, denoted by (b) in (2).
let us emphasize that the lagrange multiplier term of the action is quadratic in b in any
dimension. the precise form of this term will be given below. as we show in the next
section, varying this action with respect to the lagrange multipliers, one obtains equations
that guarantee that the b eld comes from a frame eld e:

3

b = (e  e).

for such b, the action (2) is just the usual action for gravity in the rst-order formulation.
this means that the theory described by (2) is indeed equivalent to gravity, in the sense
that all solutions of einsteins theory are also solutions of (2).

the second part of our paper is devoted to quantum theory. we study a quantization of
the theory described by (2) along the lines of refs. [7,3,13]. this quantization procedure,
which can be called a spin foam quantization, will be summarized in some details in
section iii. for now, let us just note that in this quantization the b eld is promoted to a
derivative operator acting on the so-called spin networks. the quadratic constraints become
constraints on representations and intertwiners labelling the spin networks. representations
satisfying these constraints will be called, following [3], simple. in four dimensions simple
representation of so(4)  su(2)  su(2) were found [7,3] to be the ones of the type (j, j),
that is, the ones carrying the same spin under the left and right copies of su(2). in section iii
we nd all possible simple representations in any dimension. surprisingly, it turns out that
the simple representations are in certain precise sense the simplest possible representations
of the gauge group. we nd that in any dimension these representations are labeled just
by a single parameter. also, in any dimension, we construct an intertwiner satisfying the
intersection constraints.

ii. classical theory

this section is devoted to an analysis of the classical theory. we will rst present the
action in several equivalent formulations and then prove that it is equivalent to the standard
einstein-hilbert action.
in subsection ii b we discuss in details the issue of dependence
between the constraints.
in this section the gauge group can be taken to be either that
corresponding to euclidean signature or to lorentzian: all our proofs are independent of
this. for deniteness, we will work with the euclidean version, in which the gauge group is
so(d), for this is what is used in the quantum part of our paper.

a. the action

the action for gravity in the bf formulation is a functional of the b eld, the connection
form a, and lagrange multipliers . there are two equivalent formulations, which are
both worth mentioning. in the rst formulation, which is more customary in the context
of bf theories, the b eld is thought of as a lie algebra valued (d  2)-form.
in the
second formulation one uses the metric-independent levi-civita density to construct from
this (d  2)-form a densitized rank two antisymmetric covariant tensor, which we will call
a bivector. we rst present the action in this second formulation, for it looks exactly the
same in any dimension d  4. thus, we start by writing b as a bivector b
ij , where greek
characters are the spacetime indices, latin letters are the internal indices, and a single tilde
over the symbol of b represents the fact that its density weight is one.

the action of the theory is then given by:

4

s[a, b, ] = z ddx b

ij f ij

 +

1
2 ijkl



b

ij

b
kl .

(3)

the action is a functional of an so(d) gauge eld aij
ij , and lagrange
multiplier elds ijkl
. this action is generally covariant: the bivector elds scale as tensor
densities of weight one, while the multipliers scale as densities of weight minus one, which
is represented by a single tilde below the symbol .

 , bivector elds b

in order to ensure the relation to gravity, the multiplier eld ijkl

 must be such that
it is completely anti-symmetric in one set of indices, and its anti-symmetrization on the
other set of indices vanishes. there is a freedom, however, on which set of indices the anti-
symmetrization is taken to vanish.
it turns out to be more convenient for the quantum
theory to choose the anti-symmetrization on the spacetime indices to vanish. this is the
choice we make. let us emphasize, however, that from the point of view of the classical
theory the two possibilities are completely equivalent in the sense that they are both enough
to guarantee the simplicity of the b eld (for a generic, non-degenerate eld b).

the postulated properties of the lagrange multiplier eld  imply that it is of the form:

 = [m]ijkl
ijkl

[m],

where [m]ijkl is the totally anti-symmetric form on the lie algebra, [m] is a completely anti-
symmetric cumulative index of length d  4, and [m] is a new lagrange multiplier eld,
which we, by abuse of notation, also call . this new lagrange multiplier eld also has
density weight minus one. the eld [m] has a property that its anti-symmetrization on
the spacetime indices vanishes:

using this new set of lagrange multipliers the action can be written as:

[m][] = 0.

s[a, b, ] = z ddx b

ij f ij

 +

1
2 [m][m]ijkl b

ij

b
kl .

(4)

(5)

let us now give another way the action (5) can be written, using the representation of
the b eld as a (d  2)-form. this is more standard in the context of bf theories. using
the denition of the bivector b,

b

ij =

1

2!(d  2)!

1...d2b1...d2 ij,

one can easily check that the action (5) can be rewritten as

s[a, b, ] =

1

2!(d  2)! z ddx b1...d2 ijf ij
b1...d2 ijij

1
2

 1...d2 +

 (b)1...d2,

(6)

(7)

where we have introduced a new two-form eld (b) with values in the lie algebra. in the
index notation it is given by:

5

thus, in the abstract notations, one can write the action as

ij
(b) := ijkl



b
kl .

zm

tr(b  f ) +

1
2

tr(b  (b)).

(8)

(9)

thus, there are two equivalent formulations of the theory. one can use the formulation in
terms of forms, given by (9), or the formulation in terms of bivectors, given by (3). in what
follows, we will mostly use the formulation in terms of bivectors.

variation of the action (5) with respect to  gives the following equations:

[m]ijkl b

ij

b

kl = []c[m]

[]

(10)

for some coecients c[m]
[] . here [m], [] are cumulative anti-symmetric indices of length d4,
lie algebra and spacetime ones correspondingly. as one can see, when equations (10) are
satised, the coecients c[m]

[] are given by:

c[m]
[] =

1

(d  4)!4!

[m]ijkl b

ij

b

kl [].

(11)

the bivector eld b can be viewed as a linear map from the space of spacetime two-forms
ij . we will say that b is generic

to the space of densitized internal two-forms: bij()  b
(or non-degenerate) if this map is invertible.

it is clear that when b comes from a frame eld e, b identically satises (10). the

following theorem states that the reverse is true.

theorem 1 in dimension d > 4 a generic b eld satises the constraints (10) if and only
if it comes from a frame eld. in other words, a non-degenerate b satises the constraints
(10) if and only if there exist e

i such that:

b

ij = |e|e[

i e]
j ,

(12)

where |e| is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix e
i .

the condition d > 4 is there because in four dimensions, under the same assumptions, there
is another solution (see [10]) given by:

b

ij = |e| kl

ij e[

k e]
l .

(13)

thus, our theorem, in particular, claims that this other solution appears only in four dimen-
sions.

proof: the constraints (10) can be conveniently subdivided into the following categories:

simplicity:

intersection:

normalization:

(14)

(15)

(16)

the reason for this terminology has to do with the conditions imposed by the various con-
straints.

in appendix a we prove the following two propositions. the rst proposition states that
imposing the simplicity condition on a non-zero two-form bij is equivalent to demanding
that the two-form is simple, or, in other words, that it factors as the outer product of
one-forms:

b[ijbkl] = 0  bij = u[ivj].

(17)

note that we have omitted the density weight of bij in the above expression. for the
discussion that follows, where we treat bij as a lie-algebra two-form, the density weight of
b is irrelevant.

the second proposition states that the intersection condition on a pair of simple two-

forms ensures that they share a common one-form factorizing both of them:

b[ijb

kl] = 0  bij = u[ivj] and b

ij = v[iwj].

(18)

moreover, the common factor vi is uniquely determined up to scaling when b and b are
not proportional to each other. in case b and b are proportional to each other, the above
statement trivially holds, but the common form vi is not determined uniquely: any linear
combination of it with the other one-form is also a common form.

let us now discuss the meaning of the normalization condition. imposing the normaliza-
tion condition on two pairs of simple two-forms, each pair of which is constructed by taking
dierent outer products of the same 4 one-forms, xes the relative normalization of the two
two-forms. in other words, given four simple two-forms

bij = nu[ivj]
ij = n w[izj]
b
ij = n u[iwj]
b
b
ij = n z[ivj],

b[ijb

kl] = b

[ijb

kl]

the conditions

imply that nn  = n n  as long as the four vectors are linearly independent.

(19)

ij , b13

ij , . . . b1d

let us now see what these assertions imply for our theory. first, consider a set of
two-forms b12
ij . according to the simplicity relations, each of these two-forms
factors into one-forms, and according to the intersection relations each pair shares a unique
common factor. note that our assumption that b is generic implies that all two-forms b
ij
are non-zero and that bs are not proportional to each other. let vi be the non-zero one-
form shared by b12
ij ; ui be the one-form
shared by b14
ij . then there are three possibilities: the one-forms ui, vi, wi span a
linear space of rank (i) 3; (ii) 2; (iii) 1. let us consider each case separately.

ij ; wi be the one-form shared by b13

ij and b12

ij and b13

ij and b14

case (i). since ui and vi are distinct one-forms that both divide b12

ij , this two-form is
ij = cu[ivj]. likewise, we can express the remaining two

given by a product of ui, vi: b12
bivectors completely in terms of our three vectors. thus, we have:

7

b12
b13
b14

ij = cu[ivj]
ij = cv[iwj]
ij = cw[iuj].

(20)

case (ii). let us assume, without loss of generality, that vi = wi. then this vector divides
all b12, b13 and b14, but ui divides both b12 and b14. so b12 and b14 are proportional,
which is excluded for a generic b.

case (iii). let us assume, without loss of generality, that ui = vi = wi. then, from the

denitions, we see that this vector must divide all three bivectors. thus, we can write

b12
b13
b14

ij = u[ipj]
ij = u[iqj]
ij = u[irj]

(21)

for some suitable vectors pi, qi, ri.

in four dimensions, the case (i) was associated with the so-called topological sector
(13) (see [10] for a discussion on this sector), while the case (iii) was associated with the
gravity sector. in dimension higher than four, however, the case (i) cannot occur since we
have, for instance, the two-form b15
ij to reckon with. this two-form must have a factor in
common with the three two-forms considered previously. in the case (i) , there is no factor
in common between the three two-forms. so the only possibility is that b15 is proportional
to for instance b12 which is not possible for a generic b. thus, we are forced to the case
(iii), in which, if we assume that the three bivectors are distinct, the only common factor is
ui. we then conclude that ui divides b15
ij as well. continuing this reasoning, we see that ui
must divide all two-forms b1
ij .

i

i e]

i . . . ed

such that e

i divides b

repeating the above arguments with dierent values for spacetime indices, we conclude
that there exist one-forms e1
if we are in
the generic case, where these vectors are pairwise distinct, this then implies that b
ij =
(e)ke[
j , where k are some coecients symmetric in , and (e) is the determinant
of the matrix e
i , which is included to give the right density weight to b. to nd the
coecients k we have to use the normalization constraints. from these constraints, we
conclude that kk = kk. this relation implies that k = cc, for some vectors
c. indeed, for k not equal to zero, there exists one-form n such that knn = 1.
multiplying the above relation by nn we get k = cc, where c = kn. thus, if we
rescale our vectors e

for any .

i = |c1    cd| 1

then we have b
redening the frame e. but in even dimensions we have b

ij = ee[

j . in odd dimensions we can always absorb the minus sign by

ij = |e|e[

i e]
j .

substituting this solution of the constraints back into the action, we nd

s[a, b(e)] = z ddx |e|e[

i e]

j f ij



(22)

which is simply the standard palatini action in terms of the frame eld e. thus, our classical
theory is indeed a reformulation of general relativity.

note that our theorem deals only with the case the b eld is non-degenerate. it would
be interesting to see what the constraints (10) imply in the case b is degenerate. this is of
no relevance for the classical theory, where one does not allow degenerate metrics. however,
the case of degenerate b eld may be quite relevant in the quantum theory, where, as the
example of 2+1 gravity suggests, the degenerate metrics play an important role. thus, it
would be quite interesting to study the degenerate sectors and to analyze their quantization.
we do not address this important problem in the present paper, hoping to return to it in
the future. for an analysis of degenerate sectors in the case of four dimensions see [1416]

b. gauge transformations

this subsection deals with the issue of dependence between the constraints (10). we show
that the fact that the constraints are not independent implies the presence of an additional
gauge symmetry in the theory. we also discuss the problem of nding an independent subset
of the constraints.

the action functional (2) is invariant under three dierent sets of gauge transformations.
two of these, spacetime dieomorphisms and frame rotations, are familiar so we need not
discuss them here, while the third is specic to our new formulation and arises from the fact
that the constraints (10) are not independent in more than four spacetime dimensions.

d)2 = d2(d  1)2/4 components of b

to understand this redundancy, let us nd the number of constraints that need to be
imposed to guarantee that the b eld comes from a frame, and compare this number with
the number of constraints in (10). in d dimensions, there are d2 components of e
i and
(c 2
ij , which means that we need the number of
independent constraints equal to the dierence between the above two numbers, that is,
d2(d2  2d  3)/4. the number of constraints we have can be calculated by looking at
the equations (10) that one obtains by varying the action with respect to the lagrange
multipliers . the free indices in this equation are [m] and anti-symmetric pairs (, ),
(, ). the equations are symmetric in these pairs. thus, the number of equations in (10)
is equal to the product of c 4
d, which is the dimension of the index [m], with the number
d(c 2
d+1)
of independent entrees in a symmetric c 2
equations.
2
however, some of these equations are simply denitions of the coecients c[m]
[] , see (11).
thus, to get the number of constraints imposed by (10), we have to subtract from the above
number the number of components in c[m]

[] . this, nally, gives

c 2

d  c 2

d matrix. this gives c 4

d

constraints. in the case of four dimensions, this number equals to 20, which is exactly the
number of constraints needed to go from the b eld to the frame. however, already in ve
dimensions this number is much larger than the number of independent constraints that are
needed: we have 250 constraints in (10) with only 75 independent constraints necessary.
the bottom line is that we have more constraints than needed for d > 4. since, as we

9

proved, there is a solution to this set of constraints, this simply means that they are highly
redundant for d > 4.

thus, the fact that not all the constraints that follow from our action principle are
independent does not cause any problems classically. however, this may lead to problems
in the quantum theory, for example, with the denition of the partition function. indeed, in
the partition function we have to integrate over the set of lagrange multipliers ijkl
. this
integration leads formally to a delta distribution of the constraint

(23)

(24)

if the constraints are not independent, the integration over all lagrange multipliers  leads
to products of delta functions that are ill-dened. thus, one may worry that the partition
function of the theory is not well-dened. the standard strategy to deal with this problem
is that of gauge xing. as we show below, the fact that the constraints are not independent
implies that there is an additional gauge symmetry in the theory. gauge xing this
symmetry amounts to nding an independent set of constraints. below we exhibit such an
independent set.

the additional gauge symmetry present because of the redundancy of the constraints

is given by the following transformation of the multiplier elds:

ijkl

 = ijklmn



b
mn.

(25)

as we shall illustrate below, this transformation leaves the action invariant. here ijklmn

is the gauge parameter, which must be symmetric under an interchange of any two of the
three antisymmetric index pairs (, ), (, ), (, ), anti-symmetric in the internal indices
jklm, and its anti-symmetrization in spacetime indices  must vanish. in addition, it
must be symmetric in the indices i, n. note also that the density weight of  must be 2.
in order to prove that the transformation (25) leaves the action invariant, we rst have

to show that the following relations hold:

b

i[j k 

klm]n + b

n[jk 

klm]i + b

i[j k 

klm]n + b

n[jk 

klm]i + b

i[j k 

klm]n + b

n[jk 

klm]i  0,

(26)

where k 
is given by (24). the proof of this fact is as follows. let us pick an arbitrary
ijkl
vector vi and set uj := vibij. we then have vikijkl = u[jbkl]. using this relation, we can
obtain the following identity:

0 = u[jukblm] = u[jkklm]nvn = vibi[jkklm]nvn,

(27)

which implies that bi[jkklm]n + bn[jkklm]i  0. this is almost the above relation (26). more
precisely, to obtain (26) we set bij = xb
ij , use the relation just proved,
expand, and equate the coecient of xyz to zero. using the relation (26) one can easily
convince oneself that the transformation (25), with the postulated symmetry properties of
the gauge parameter, leaves the action invariant.

ij + yb

ij + zb

it turns out that the set of gauge transformations (25) is complete, i.e., these are all
gauge symmetries appearing because of the redundancy of the constraints. in other words,
rst, gauge xing this symmetry amounts to choosing an independent subset of constraints;
second, all other constraints follow from this independent subset and the relations (26). let
us now present an independent subset of constraints (10) that is enough to guarantee that
b comes from a frame. as we have said above, these independent constraints, plus the
relations (26) imply the rest of the constraints. the following proposition is a statement to
this eect.

straints (10).

a proof of this proposition consists of two parts. first, as it is easy to see, the number
of constraints in (28) is just the right number of constraints needed to go from the b eld
to a frame. indeed, there are d(c 2
d1
in (iii), (c 2
d  d constraints in (v). adding all these
d)2  d2, which is the number of dof in the b
numbers together one obtains exactly (c 2
eld minus the number of dof in the frame. thus, the counting shows that the number
of constraints (28) is not larger than the number of constraints that is needed. the second
part of the proof is to show that the constraints (28) are enough to guarantee that the b
eld comes from a frame. this is done by expressing all the other constraints as constraints
(28) modulo the relations (26). we will not give a proof of this fact here, for it involves a
rather lengthy manipulation with the relations (26).

iii. quantum models

this section is devoted to quantum theory. more precisely, we apply the so-called spin
foam quantization procedure to our theory. we rst review the main steps of this procedure,
and then nd results analogous to ones available in the case of four dimensions.

a. spin foam quantization

in the paper [13] it was advocated that the knowledge of the generating functional z[j]

11

z[j] = z dadb eirm

tr[bf +bj]

(29)

of the bf theory, hence the ability to compute all correlation functions of the b eld in
the bf theory, opens a way towards understanding of yang-mills theories in any dimension
and of gravity in three and four dimensions. the key point is to consider these theories as
deformations of the bf theory. the knowledge of z[j] leads to an understanding of these
theories in the same way as the knowledge of the generating functional of the free scalar
eld leads to understanding of an interacting quantum eld theory. similar ideas were also
put forward by martellini and collaborators for the case of yang-mills theory [2]. as far as
gravity is concerned, a strength of this proposal is in the fact that the bf theory incorporates
gauge invariance and needs no background metric for its denition, which are two features
desired for a non-perturbative treatment of gravity.

moreover, in [13] a spin foam computation of the generating functional was performed.
the resulting spin foam version of the generating functional immediately gives the spin
foam quantization of any theory considered as a constrained bf theory. in this quantization
the eld b is promoted to a derivative operator (in j) acting on the generating functional
z(j).

in the previous section we showed that gravity in higher dimensions can be written as
bf theory with constraints. this means that gravity in any dimension falls within the
scope of applicability of the method [13]. thus, there exists a spin foam model of higher-
dimensional gravity, some aspects of which we study below. the spin foam model we obtain
is a generalization of the 4d spin foam model proposed in [6,7,3] to higher dimensions.

in this paper we describe only the main steps of the spin foam quantization procedure.
for details the reader may consult refs. [7,3,13]. one starts with a decomposition of m into
piecewice-linear cells. for simplicity this decomposition is usually taken to be a triangulation
which we shall denote by ; it will be xed in what follows. having a xed triangulation,
one can compute the spin foam approximation to the generating functional z[j] of the bf
theory. this is an approximation because it takes into account only special distributional
congurations of the b eld. however, as it was shown in [13], this approximation is exact
for tqft.

the result of calculation of z[j] can be described as follows. up to ne details related
to the way the simplex amplitudes are glued together, z[j] can be thought of as given by
a sum over product of amplitudes  one for each d-simplex. these amplitudes depend on
the current through a collection of group elements. the current, being a two-form, can be
integrated over the special portions of the dual faces of  that are called in [6,13] wedges.
each wedge is in one-to-one correspondence with a pair (d-simplex, (d  2)-simplex lying
in it). integrating j over all wedges of , one gets a collection of lie algebra elements. ex-
ponentiating the later one obtains a collection of group elements. the generating functional
z[j] depends on the current through these group elements.

the simplex amplitude is obtained as follows. first, one has to construct a special graph.
the boundary of each d-simplex is a (d  1)-dimensional manifold triangulated by (d  1)-
simplices. one can construct a graph dual to this triangulation. in d spacetime dimensions,
this graph will have d + 1 vertex and d(d + 1)/2 edges. each vertex will have exactly d
edges coming to it, or, in other words, its valency will be d. for each edge, let us take
the usual space l2(g) of square integrable functions on the group. edges of these graph

12

are in one-to-one correspondence with wedges introduced above, and, thus, with the group
elements constructed above from the current j. thus, we can think of elements of l2(g)
for each edge of our graph as functions of the group elements constructed from the current.
to construct the vertex amplitude, which is a function of all d(d + 1)/2 group elements
coming from j, one has to choose the so-called intertwiner for each vertex.
intertwiners
give a way to construct a function of d(d + 1)/2 group elements that is invariant under
the action of the group. this function is the simplex amplitude. in practice, the simplex
amplitudes are given by the so-called spin networks, which are constructed by taking a basis
in l2(g) consisting of the matrix elements of the irreducible representations.

given the generating functional z(j), the computation of the expectation values of
products of b eld is given by derivative operators acting on z(j). thus, amplitudes for
gravity theory can be obtained from the above simplex amplitudes by imposing on them
certain dierential equations with respect to the current. this procedure can be justied as
a projection on the kernel of constraints arising when one takes the path integral over the
lagrange multipliers :

z deirm

1

2 tr[b(b)] = (c),

(30)

where c are the constraints (23). after nding solutions to the dierential equations cor-
responding to these constraints, one evaluates them on j = 0 to obtain amplitudes for
gravity.

there are several types of constraints that one has to impose. first, there are the so-called
closure constraints. these arise because one is considering a set of lie algebra two-forms
bij, one for each (d  2)-simplex, that are obtained by integrating the b eld, which is a
(d  2)-form, over these (d  2)-simplices, and there are linear dependences between bij
obtained this way. it is straightforward to solve the dierential equations corresponding to
these constraints for they simply require the simplex amplitude to be gauge invariant.

second, there are simplicity constraints for each (d  2)-simplex, or for each two-form
bij, which require this two-form to be simple. this constraints can also be solved in quantum
theory. they imply that only a part of the space l2(g) is relevant. this relevant part can be
written as a direct sum over special representations that can be called simple representations.
we nd and study some properties of these representations in the following subsection.

third, there are analogs of intersection constraints. in the quantum theory these con-
straints appear as constraints on intertwiners. we nd a solution to these constraints in
subsection iii c.

finally, there is a problem of imposing analogs of normalization constraints. however,
these are non-trivial already in the case of four dimensions. already in that case, there
exists a lot of confusion in the literature as to this problem. we will not discuss it in this
paper.

in this paper we will not discuss the spin foam model itself; instead, we would like to
understand what are the implications, from the point of view of representation theory, of
the simplicity and intersection constraints.

13

b. simple representations

in this section we use notations and general results on representation theory of so(d)
that are described in appendices b and c. we refer the reader to the books [18,17] for a
deeper exposition of the results stated in these two appendices.

let us denote the basis of the lie algebra of so(d) by xij, i, j  {1, . . . , d}. the
commutation relations are given by (b1). as we have discussed in the previous section,
two-forms bij are promoted in the spin foam quantization to derivative operators acting
on the generating functional. since lie algebra is generated by derivatives (vector elds) on
the group, this means that bij is promoted in the quantum theory to an element xij of the
lie algebra of so(d).

the quantum analog of the pluecker relation (17) is given by:

x[ijxkl] = 0, i, j, k, l  {1, . . . , d},

(31)

where [ijkl] means that we consider the total anti-symmetrization on these indices.

given a linear representation v of so(d) we say will that v is a simple representation

if the quantum pluecker relation (31) is identically satised on v .

it is clear that if v is simple, it decomposes into a sum of irreducible simple represen-
tations of so(d); so it is enough to concentrate on irreducible simple representations. the
purpose of this subsection is to give a complete classication of the space of simple rep-
resentations of so(d) for all values of d. we nd that the simple representations in any
dimension are labelled by only one positive integer. thus, there is a remarkable similarity
between simple representations in any dimension d starting from d = 3.

there is a natural representation of so(d) in the space l2(sd1) of square integrable

functions on the (d  1)-sphere. the group action is given by:

g  (x) = (g1x),

(32)

where x = (x1,    , xd) is a unit vector from rd. this representation is reducible: any l2
function on the sphere can be decomposed into spherical harmonics

l2(sd1) = 

n =0h (d)
n ,

(33)

where h (d)
represents the space of harmonic homogeneous polynomial of degree n (see
appendix c). the action of the lie algebra elements xij in the space l2(sd1) is given by:

n

xij  (x) = xi


xj

(x)  xj


xi

(x).

(34)

it is now obvious to see that the space l2(sd1), and, therefore, h(d)
sentation.

n gives a simple repre-

x[ijxkl] = x[ijxkl] = x[ijkl] + x[ixkjl] = 0

(35)

the rst equality is the denition of the representation, the second is obtained by commuting
x and , and the third by taking into account the anti-symmetrization on the indices.

a remarkable fact is that the spherical harmonics representations h(d)

n are the only

simple representations of so(d). the following theorem is a statement to this eect:

14

theorem 2 v is an irreducible simple representation of so(d), d  4, if and only if v
is equivalent to one of the representations h(d)
n .

we would like to present two proofs of this fact, one by recurrence and the other more
direct. both these proofs use the fact that an irreducible representation is uniquely charac-
terized by its highest weight. moreover, the highest weight characterizing h(d)
n is ne1, in
the notation of appendices b and c.

before we give the proofs, let us make several comments. first, for d = 3 there is no
pluecker relation; one can say that all representation of so(3) are simple. in that case the
above theorem is still valid, because the representations h(d)
n exhaust all representations of
so(3). they correspond, of course, to the integer spin representations of spin(3)  su(2).
the second comment is that in dimension d = 4, the theorem has already been proved
in [7]. however, these authors did not realize the crucial fact that the simple representations
are related to spherical harmonics. this is this fact that allows us to nd the generalization
of simple representations to higher dimensions. let us see how the simple representations
of [7] are related to the ones described in the above theorem.
in d = 4, x[ijxkl] is an
invariant tensor (there is only one such tensor because in dimension four there is a unique
totally anti-symmetric tensor of rank four). the value of this tensor on the representation
(n1, n2) = e1(n1 +n2)/2+e2(n1 n2)/2 (see appendix b) is given by n1(n1 +2)n2(n2 +2).
in that case the quantum pluecker relation reads n1 = n2 = n, so simple representations
of so(4) are given by the highest weight  = ne1, n being a positive integer. this is
precisely the highest weight of the representation h(4)
n . let us now give the proofs for a
general dimension d.

proof 1 as we have just discussed, the theorem holds for dimensions d = 3, 4. thus, to
prove the theorem in any dimension, it is enough to show that from the fact that it holds in
dimension d it follows that it holds in d +1. thus, we assume that representations h(d)
n are
the only simple irreducible representations of so(d) and show that from this assumption it
follows that h(d+1)
are the only simple irreducible representations of so(d + 1). we prove
this by constructing an embedding of so(d) into so(d + 1) and then showing that the pull-
back of simple representations of so(d + 1) under this embedding is a simple representation
of so(d). as the last step of the proof we show that the only irreducible representations of
so(d + 1) that have the property that their pullback contains the representations h(d)
n are
the representations h(d+1)

n

.

n

let us construct an embedding of so(d) into so(d + 1). since so(d + 1) is the group
of rotation of d + 1 dimensional vectors, so(d) can be obtained as the subgroup xing the
vector (0, . . . , 0, 1). this gives an embedding of so(d) into so(d + 1), which we denote by

 : so(d)  so(d + 1).

if xij, i, j  {1, . . . , d} is a basis of so(d), then the action of the embedding  on the
lie algebra is given by (xij) = xij for i, j  {1, . . . , d}.
if v is a representation of
so(d + 1) we can dene its pullback (v ) using the embedding . in other words, when
v (d+1)
is a representation of so(d + 1) of highest weight , g  so(d) and v  v (d+1)
,

then g  (v) = (g)  v. thus, (v (d+1)
) is a representation of so(d). however, this





15

representation is not necessarily irreducible, but it certainly contains, when decomposed
into a sum of irreducible representations, the irreducible subrepresentation of highest weight
(). this is because the embedding  maps positive roots onto positive roots and (v)
is the highest weight for so(d).

let us now take as v (d+1)

(v (d+1)

have:

a simple representation of so(d + 1). then the pullback
) is a simple representation of so(d). indeed, considering a basis of so(d), we



x[ijxkl]  (v (d+1)



)  (x[ij)(xkl])  v (d+1)



= x[ijxkl]  v (d+1)



= 0.

(36)

here the rst equality is the denition of the pullback of a representation, in the second
we used the denition of the embedding, and the third uses the hypothesis that v (d+1)
is
simple.



this result means that () is the highest weight of a simple representation of so(d).
we have assumed that all highest weight simple representations of so(d) come from weights
ne1. in other words, () must equal ne1 for some n. we would like to show now that
the only highest weights  of so(d + 1) satisfying this property are the ones corresponding
to the representations h (d+1)
, i.e.,  = ne1. to see this we have to consider two cases: (i)
n
d = 2n; (ii) d = 2n + 1.

(i) in this case, so(2n) and so(2n + 1) have the same rank n, and  is the identity

operator, (ei) = ei. thus, () = ne1 implies that  = ne1.

(ii) in this case, so(2n + 1) has rank n, while so(2n + 2) has rank n + 1. thus,  is the
projection operator (ei) = ei, i  n and (en+1) = 0. therefore, () = ne1 implies
that  = ne1 + ken+1 for some k. but  is a highest weight of so(2n + 1). this means
(see appendices b and c) that  = n1e1 + n2e2 +    + nn+1en+1 where n1  n2     
nn+1  0. thus, if n  2, the only highest weight  of so(2n + 1) satisfying () = ne1
is given by  = ne1.

proof 2 here is a more direct proof of the theorem that uses the correspondence (b2)
between the cartan basis and the usual basis of so(d). let us denote for 1  i < j  n,
n = [d/2],

c(i, j) = 3x[2i1,2ix2j1,2j].

(37)

if v (d)
using (b2) and after some algebra we get:



is a simple representation of so(d), then the action of c(i, j) vanishes on v (d)
 .

c(i, j) = hj(hi + 1) + eeiej eei+ej  eei+ej eeiej .

evaluating this expression on the highest weight vector v we get:

c(i, j)v = (|ej)((|ei) + 1)v.

(38)

(39)

the simplicity constraint implies that (|ej)((|ei) + 1) = 0 for all 1  i < j  n, which
means (|ej) = 0 for all 1 < j  n. thus, the only highest weights representations that
satisfy the simplicity constraint correspond to  = ne1.

c. simple spin networks

in this section we deal with the quantum version of the intersection constraints. as we
discussed above, these become equations on intertwiners. in this subsection we show how
to solve these constraints in any dimension. we arrive at a notion of simple spin networks,
whose edges are labelled by simple representations satisfying the simplicity constraints, and
whose intertwiners satisfy the intersection relations. the simple spin networks are higher
dimensional generalizations of the relativistic spin networks of [7]. however, let us rst recall
some general facts about spin networks. a more detailed account is given in [3].

an so(d) spin network is a triple (, , ), where (i)  is an oriented graph, (ii)  is a
labelling of each edge e by an irreducible representation e of so(n), (iii)  is a labelling of
each vertex by an intertwiner v mapping the tensor product of incoming representations at
v to the product of outgoing representations at v. let us denote by i(, , v) the space of
such intertwiners at vertex v. we can then associate to each colored graph (, ) a vector
space

h(, ) = vi(, , v).

(40)

when  has only one edge and one vertex (circle), this space is one dimensional and is
generated by the function on so(n) given by the character in the representation . for a
general graph this space can be thought of as the space of functionals in the variables e(ge)
which are invariant under gauge transformation acting at each vertex of . this is the space
of spin network functionals based on the colored graph (, ).

given an oriented edge e, let us denote by e the vertex where e starts and by e+ the
vertex where e ends. for any pair (e, ), we can dene a group action on h(, ). this is
given by the right or left multiplication:

h(e,e+)(ge1,    , ge,    , gen) = (ge1,    , geh,    , gen),
h(e,e)(ge1,    , ge,    , gen) = (ge1,    , h1ge,    , gen).

we denote x (e,e) the corresponding action of the lie algebra by the derivative operator.
we can now introduce the notion of simple spin networks.

we say that an so(n) spin network   h(, ) is simple if for all vertices v and all

pairs of edges e, e meeting at v, the following relation is satised:

x (e,v)

[ij x (e,v)

kl]  = 0.

(41)

this relation, for a pair (e, e), amounts to the quantum pluecker relation (31) for the rep-
resentation e. this means that the edges of a simple spin network are labelled by simple
representations, that is, are colored by one integer ne which characterize the simple rep-
resentations h(d)
ne . the remaining conditions (41) for distinct pairs of edges meeting at a
vertex v are conditions on the intertwining operator used at the vertex v.

let e1, . . . , en be the incoming edges and e

v. then h(d)
nei

, h(d)
ne
j

p be the outgoing edges at the vertex
are simple representations associated with edges meeting at v. an

1, . . . , e

intertwiner from the tensor product of incoming simple representations to the product of
outgoing ones is given by a multi-linear map

17

i(p1,    , pn, q1,    , qp),

(42)

where pi (qj respectively) are harmonic homogeneous polynomials of degree nei (ne
spectively), and q denotes the complex conjugate of q. the intertwining property reads

j

re-

i(p1,    , pn, q1,    , qp) = i(g  p1,    , g  pn, g  q1,    , g  qp),

and an example of the relation (41) is given by:

i(x[ij  p1, xkl]  p2,    , pn, q1,    , qp) = 0

(43)

(44)

there exists a very simple and beautiful solution of these constraints. this solution
was discovered for the case d = 4 by [7]. however, in that work, it was written in a rather
cumbersome way as a sum over a product of intertwiners of su(2). moreover, the proof that
the intertwiner satises the intersection constraints used heavily the fact that the universal
covering of so(4) can be written as the product su(2)  su(2). this uses the duality
available in d = 4, which makes this dimension very special. thus, it was not at all clear
that this solution could be generalized to higher dimensions, where there is no notion of
duality. the solution we give shows that the central notion, allowing the construction to
work, is not self-duality, but the fact that simple representations are realized in the space of
polynomials on the sphere sd1.

let pi (qj respectively) be harmonic homogeneous polynomial of degree nei (ne

j

re-

spectively) and consider the following intertwiner between

n

i=1h(d)
nei

and p

j=1 (h(d)
ne
j

)

given by

in,p(p1,    , pn, q1,    , qp) = zsd1

d(x) p1(x)    pn(x) q1(x)    qp(x).

(45)

here d denotes the invariant measure on the unit sphere sd1. for deniteness we choose
the normalization of this measure such that

zsd1

d(x) = 1

the fact that in,p is an invariant intertwiner can be easily seen using the invariance of
the measure, integration by parts and the leibniz rule. this is, in a sense, the simplest
possible intertwiner one can imagine. note that the above intertwiner in the case d = 3 is
the usual intertwiner of so(3) that is constructed from clebsch-gordan coecients. it is
remarkable that such a simple entity gives a simple intertwiner:

theorem 3 in,p satises the relation (41).

proof: let us consider a vertex with n incoming and p outgoing edges. let us choose any
two of the incoming edges, which we denote by e1 and e2. let us denote by f the product

18

of all polynomials p, q except pe1, pe2: f = qi6=1,2 pei qj qej . we then have to prove that
the following quantity

x e1

[ijx e2

kl]in,p = zsd1

dx[ij  pe1xkl]  pe2f

(46)

is zero. we can use the following identity:

2x[ij  pe1xkl]  pe2 = x[ij  xkl]  (pe1pe2)  (x[ijxkl]  pe1)pe2  pe1(x[ijxkl]  pe2),

(47)

the last two terms are zero because p s are homogeneous polynomials. similarly, the
rst term is zero because the product of homogeneous polynomials is also a homogeneous
polynomial. the other intersection relations can be proved analogously.
2

one question that remains is the question of uniqueness of the intertwiner we constructed.
however, this question is non-trivial already in the case of four dimensions. in the case of
d = 4 there exists an argument [19] that shows that this intertwiner is the only one satisfying
all the constraints. thus, it may be the case that the intertwiner we found is unique in any
dimension. it would be interesting to nd a proof of this conjecture. we leave this issue to
further research.

iv. discussion

we have seen that, in many aspects, the bf formulation of higher-dimensional gravity
is analogous to the four-dimensional case.
indeed, as in four dimensions, one must add
to the usual bf action constraints that are quadratic in the b eld and that guarantee
that it comes from the frame eld. we also saw that the quantum spin foam models in
higher dimensions are quite similar to their four-dimensional cousin. strikingly, in any
dimension representations that appear are labelled by just one parameter, the structure of
the intertwiner that is used to built the model is quite similar to that in four dimensions. let
us emphasize that this similarity between the case of four dimensions and higher dimensional
theories is by itself an interesting and unexpected result.
indeed, as we discussed in the
introduction, it is tempting to believe that the four-dimensional case is special, for there
the self-duality is available. our results indicate that the case of four dimensions is not that
special.

there are, however, several dierences between the case of four dimensions and higher-
dimensional gravity that are worth mentioning. first, unlike the four-dimensional case, in
higher dimensions it is much harder to single out the independent constraints. in four dimen-
sions the number of lagrange multipliers that appear in the action is equal to the number of
independent constraints. in higher dimensions we were not able to nd a covariant formu-
lation with this property: the number of lagrange multipliers appearing in the action (2)
is much larger than the number of independent constraints. we were able, however, to nd
a description of independent constraints, see the subsection of ii on gauge transformations,
but not in any covariant way. thus, unlike the four-dimensional case, we dont have an
action principle with the number of lagrange multipliers appearing equal to the number of

19

independent constraints. this does not seem, however, to cause any problems, either classi-
cally or quantum mechanically. classically one nds complicated relations (26) between the
constraints appearing from varying the action (2), and this is manifested by the appearance
of gauge symmetries discussed in section ii. however, all relations together, although not
independent, do imply that the b eld comes from a frame eld. one might worry that the
dependence of constraints may cause problems quantum mechanically. however, as we saw,
it doesnt seem to be the case, at least in the spin foam context. as we have seen in the last
section, it was possible to impose the simplicity and intersection constraints on spin foam
by explicitly constructing the intertwiners satisfying these constraints.

the second important dierence between d = 4 and the higher-dimensional cases is the
absence of the topological sector. as we saw in subsection ii a, in higher dimensions there
is only one type of solutions of the simplicity constraints, in contrast to two dierent types
in the case of four dimensions: the case (i), according to the classication of the subsection
ii a, can exist only in four dimensions, where it leads to the topological sector. this is
an interesting feature of higher-dimensional gravity, for it means that one does not have to
worry about a possible interference between the two sectors when they are both present in
the quantum theory. also, unlike the four-dimensional case, there is no worry that the spin
foam quantization gives a quantization of the topological sector, not gravity: simply because
there is no topological sector anymore. of course, one still has to worry about the issue of
two signs, arising in the solution of the constraint equations. but this comes about even
in the simplest case of three dimensions, where the two types of solutions can interfere in the
quantum theory and make the problem of nding the gravitational sector of the theory
very dicult, see [1] for a discussion of this problem.

let us now discuss implications of our results for the problem of quantization of gravity.
we have discussed some aspects of the spin foam quantum model of gravity for all d > 4.
as we saw, these models turn out to be quite similar to the four-dimensional model. there
are, however, many problems with this model even in the case of d = 4, of which the main
one is probably that one does not know how to glue the simplex amplitudes together to
form the amplitude of the whole triangulated manifold. the other problem is that we do
not know yet how to implement the normalization conditions in the quantum theory. thus,
the quantum theory presented in this paper is far from giving a correct quantization of
gravity.

our results, however, have another interesting implication for the problem of quantum
gravity. our results imply that gravity, as well as yang-mills theory in any dimension,
can be thought of as an interacting bf theory. indeed, the action of this theories can
be rewritten as that of bf theory plus an additional term quadratic in the b eld, which
can be thought of as the interaction term. this means that the problem of quantization
of both yang-mills and gravity theories in any dimension to a large extent reduces to the
problem of nding the generating functional z[j] of the bf theory:

z[j] = z dadb eirm

tr(bf )+tr(bj),

indeed, because actions for the both theories can be
where j is the current two-form.
represented in the form bf action plus quadratic term in b, all correlation functions of
these theories (in b eld) can be found by appropriately dierentiating the generating

20

functional z[j] with respect to j. thus, z[j] is a universal object, a knowledge of which
in a particular spacetime dimension to a large extent means the knowledge of both yang-
mills and gravity theories in that dimension. this way of approaching the problem of
four-dimensional quantum gravity was advocated in [13]. the results of our paper mean
that this strategy can also be applied to higher dimensional theories. let us also mention
that a partial progress along the lines of nding z[j] was achieved in [13], where we found
a spin foam approximation to this generating functional in any dimension.

let us conclude by pointing out another interesting implication of our results. in four
spacetime dimensions, the use spin foam models was to a large extent motivated by results
of the canonical approach to quantum gravity [4]: the known four-dimensional spin foam
models are intimately related to the loop canonical quantization of gravity. we have found
that the spin foam model formulation of quantum gravity is not limited to four dimensions.
thus, our results point towards an interesting possibility that there exists an analog of
canonical connection quantization of gravity in any dimension. work is currently in progress
on trying to nd such a formulation.

appendix a: pluecker relations

relations which enforce that a multivector factors as an anti-symmetrized product of
vectors arise in the geometry of subspaces of linear spaces, and are known as pluecker
relations. in this appendix, we shall review and demonstrate some relevant facts of algebraic
geometry concerning those relations.

as the rst step, we shall consider the case of a single two-form bij, and show that the
necessary and sucient condition for it to be an anti-symmetrized product of one-forms is
the following:

b[ijbkl] = 0.

(a1)

before showing that this condition implies factorization, we will note that it is equivalent to
the following weaker condition:

1
2

bi[jbkl] = bijbkl + bikblj + bilbjk = 0.

to see that this is the case, we simply write out the six terms appearing in the complete
anti-symmetrization on the indices ijkl, and note that each of the three possible ways of
choosing a pair of two indices appears twice. let us now show that the above condition
implies that the two-form bij factors as a product of one-forms. if bij is not identically
zero, then we can nd vectors ai and bj such that bijaibj = 1. let us now dene one-forms
ui and vi as ui = bijaj and vi = bijaj. then, using the above identity, we obtain

uivj  viuj = (bikbjl  bilbjk)akbl = bijbklakbl = bij.

21

thus, this proves the simplicity of bij by explicitly constructing the two one-forms that
divide it.

next, given two simple two-forms, let us nd a condition that they have a non zero

common factor. first, assuming that this is the case, we have:

bij = u[ivj]

and

b

ij = v[iwj].

we then see that bij + b
ij must be a non zero simple bivector for any value of the
constants , . using the simplicity criterion that we have already proved above, this will
be the case if the relation

b[ijb

kl] = 0

is satised. this is the relation we looked for. let us now show that this relation is also
a sucient condition for two two-forms to have a common factor. to show this we shall
produce this common factor explicitly. consider the following entity:

bi[jb

kl].

if the two bivectors appearing in the above expression were proportional, then, because
they are simple, this expression would vanish identically. if they are not proportional, it is
possible to choose vectors ai, bi, and ci such that the expression

vi := bi[jb

kl]ajbkcl

diers from zero. the fact that this one-form is a factor of bij follows immediately from:

b[ijvk] = b[ijbk][lb

mn]albmcn = 0,

where we have used the fact that bij satises the simplicity constraint. to see that our
vector also divides the other bivector, we note that there is another expression for vi. the
pluecker relation reads:

0 = b[ijb

kl] = bi[jb

kl] + b

i[jbkl].

this means that the roles of the two bivectors in our formula are interchangeable. hence vi
is a factor of both bivectors. this vector is unique up to rescaling, for the two two-forms
are distinct.

appendix b: some facts about so(n) and its representation

theory

we will denote by xij, i, j  {1, . . . , d} generators of lie algebra so(d). they satisfy

the following commutation relations:

[xij, xkl] = ikxjl  ilxjk  jkxil + jlxik

(b1)

let us consider the cartan representation of this lie algebra. there are two cases to
consider: (i) d = 2n + 1; (ii) d = 2n. in the rst case the corresponding dynkin diagram
is bn; in the second case it is dn.

22

the cartan subalgebra h of so(2n + 1) is generated by hk = ix2k12k, k = 1, . . . , n.

we denote by ek the generators of the dual of h, ek(hj) = kj.
let us denote by   h the root space of so(d). we have

 = {ei  ej, with 1  i < j  n}  {ei, 1  i  n},
 = {ei  ej, with 1  i < j  n},

for d = 2n.

for d = 2n + 1.

the cartan basis hi, e, i  {1, . . . , n},    is related to the basis xij by

hi = ix2i12i

eei+ej =

eeiej =

eeiej =

eei+ej =

[x2i1,2j1 + ix2i1,2j + ix2i,2j1  x2i,2j],

[x2i1,2j1 + ix2i1,2j  ix2i,2j1  x2i,2j],

[x2i1,2j1  ix2i1,2j + ix2i,2j1  x2i,2j].

where 1  i < j  n.

the simple roots are given by:

1 = e1  e2, . . . , n1 = en1  en, n = en,

1 = e1  e2, . . . , n1 = en1  en, n = en1 + en,

for d = 2n + 1,
for d = 2n.

one of the central theorems in the theory of lie groups states that the irreducible rep-
resentations of the covering group of so(d), i.e. spin(d), are in one-to-one correspondence
with the dominant integral weights, that is, weights of the form:

 =

n

xi=1

nii,

where ni are positive integers, i are the dynkin weights satisfying 2(i, j)/(j, j) = ij
and n = [d/2] ([] is the integral part).  denotes the highest weight of the corresponding
irreducible representation.

when expressed in the basis given by the weights ei, 1  i  n, the highest weights

labelling representations of spin(d) are given by:

(n1,    , nn) = (n1 +    + nn2 + nn1 +

)e1

+    + (nn2 + nn1 +

nn

for d = 2n

(b13)

the irreducible representations of so(d) are in one-to-one correspondence with the
irreducible representations of spin(d) that satisfy the restriction: (i) nn is an even integer
for d = 2n + 1; (ii) nn1 + nn is an even integer for d = 2n.

appendix c: harmonic polynomial representations of so(n)

let v (d)

n

be the space of complex-valued homogeneous polynomials of degree n on rd.
then so(d) acts on this space by g  p (x) = p (g1x). this action induces the following
action of the lie algebra so(d):

xij  p (x) = xi p

xj (x)  xj p

xi (x).

the basis of weight vectors of v (d)

n

is given by:

(x1 + ix2)k1(x1  ix2)l1    (x2n1  ix2n)l1,

for d = 2n

(x1 + ix2)k1(x1  ix2)l1    (x2n1  ix2n)l1xk0

2n+1, for d = 2n + 1,

(c1)

(c2)
(c3)

where n = pj kj + pi li. this basis diagonalizes the action of the cartan subalgebra
generated by hi = ix2i12i. hence, the weights of v (d)

are given by:

n

j=n

(ki  li)ei.

xi=1

(c4)

the highest weight of v (d)

n

is ne1 and its dimension is c n +d1

n

.

this representation is, however, not irreducible. to see this, let us consider the casimir

c =

1
2 xij

xijxij.

its action on v (d)

n

is given by:

c  p (x) = n(n + d  2)p (x) + |x|2p (x),

(c5)

where  = (1)2 +    + (d)2 is the laplacian. thus, an invariant subspace of this action
is the subspace h(d)
n of harmonic homogeneous polynomials on rd. this space is known
to be an irreducible representation of so(d). thus, h(d)
n can be equivalently characterized
as the irreducible representation of highest weight  = ne1. the dimension of h(d)
n can be
deduced from the dimension of v (d)

using the following relations

n

dimh(d)

n = dimv (d)

n  dimv (d)
n 2,

dimh(d)

n =

n

xk=1

dimh(d1)

k

.

from the rst relation we deduce that

dimh(d)

n =

(n + d  3)!(2n + d  2)

n!(d  2)!

.

(c6)

(c7)

(c8)

the second equality tells us how h(d)
as a sum of irreducible representations.

n , viewed as a representation of so(d 1), decomposes
