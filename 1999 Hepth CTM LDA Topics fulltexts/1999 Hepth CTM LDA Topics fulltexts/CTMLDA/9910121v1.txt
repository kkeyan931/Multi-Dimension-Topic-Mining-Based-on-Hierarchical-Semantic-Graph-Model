abstract

subsingular vectors of the n=2 superconformal algebras were discovered, and ex-
amples given, in 1996. shortly afterwards semikhatov and tipunin claimed to have
obtained a complete classication of the n=2 subsingular vectors in the paper the
structure of verma modules over the n=2 superconformal algebra, hep-th/9704111,
published in cmp 195 (1998) 129. surprisingly, the only explicit examples of n=2 sub-
singular vectors known at that time did not t into their classication. all the results
presented in that paper, including the classication of subsingular vectors, were based
on the following assumptions: i) the authors claimed that there are only two dierent
types of submodules in n=2 verma modules, overlooking from the very beginning inde-
composable no-label singular vectors, that had been discovered a few months before,
and clearly do not t into their two types of submodules, and ii) the authors claimed
to have constructed non-conventional singular vectors with the property of generating
the two types of submodules maximally, i.e. with no subsingular vectors left outside.
in this note we prove that both assumptions are incorrect. these facts also aect pro-
foundly the results presented in several other publications, especially the papers: on
the equivalence of ane sl(2) and n=2 ...., by semikhatov, hep-th/9702074, embed-
ding diagrams of n=2 verma modules ...., by semikhatov and sirota, hep-th/9712102,

introduction and notation

the topological n=2 superconformal algebra was deduced in 1990 as the symmetry algebra of
two-dimensional topological conformal eld theory (tcft) [20]. it was the last n=2 superconfor-
mal algebra to be discovered and in fact can be obtained from the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra by
modifying the stress-energy tensor by adding the derivative of the u(1) current, a procedure known
as topological twist [21][22]. it reads

[lm, ln] = (m  n)lm+n ,
[lm, gn] = (m  n)gm+n ,
[lm, qn] = nqm+n ,
[lm, hn] = nhm+n + c
{gm, qn} = 2lm+n  2nhm+n + c

6 (m2 + m)m+n,0 ,

3 (m2 + m)m+n,0 ,

3 mm+n,0 ,

[hm, hn] = c
[hm, gn] = gm+n ,
[hm, qn] = qm+n ,

m, n  z .

(1.1)

where lm and hm are the bosonic generators corresponding to the stress-energy tensor (virasoro
generators) and the u(1) current, respectively, and gm and qm are the spin-2 and spin-1 fermionic
generators, the latter being the modes of the brst-current. the eigenvalues of the bosonic zero
modes (l0, h0) correspond to the conformal weight and the u(1) charge of the states. in a verma
module these eigenvalues split conveniently as ( + l, h + q) for secondary states, where l and q are
the level and the relative charge of the state and (, h) are the conformal weight and the charge of
the primary state on which the secondary is built. the topological central charge c is the central
charge corresponding to the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra. the determinant formula for this algebra
has remained unpublished until very recently [7], although the chiral determinant formula, which
applies to chiral verma modules was published in 1997 [3].

0 and g

due to the existence of the fermionic zero modes g0 and q0 this algebra has two sectors: the
g-sector (states annihilated by g0) and the q-sector (brst-invariant states annihilated by q0), in
analogy with the (+)-sector and the ()-sector of the ramond n=2 algebra, due to the fermionic
zero modes g+
0 . however, the two sectors do not provide the complete description  and
this is true for the ramond n=2 algebra as well  since there are also states which do not belong
to any of the sectors [1][6][7]. that is, not all verma modules and submodules decompose into
the two sectors, but there are also indecomposable states, in particular indecomposable singular
vectors. to see this one only needs to inspect the anticommutator of the fermionic zero modes
{g0, q0} = 2l0 acting on a given state |i. if the conformal weight of |i is dierent from zero;
i.e. l0|i = ( + l)|i 6= 0, then |i can be decomposed into a state |ig annihilated by g0, but
not by q0, that we refer as g0-closed and a state |iq annihilated by q0, but not by g0, that we
refer as q0-closed:

|i =

q0g0|i +

g0q0|i = |iq + |ig .

(1.2)

if the conformal weight of |i is zero, however, one only obtains (g0q0 + q0g0)|i = 0, which
is satised in four dierent ways: i) the state is g0-closed, |i = |ig, and g0q0|ig = 0, ii) the
state is q0-closed, |i = |iq, and q0g0|iq = 0, iii) the state is chiral, |i = |ig,q, annihilated

1

by both g0 and q0, and iv) the state is indecomposable no-label, |i = |i, not annihilated by
any of the fermionic zero modes.

in what follows we will use the standard denition of highest weight vectors and singular vectors
for conformal algebras, i.e. they are the states with lowest conformal weight (lowest energy) in
the verma modules and in the null submodules, respectively, and therefore are annihilated by
all the positive modes of the generators of the algebra (the lowering operators); i.e. ln1|i =
hn1|i = gn1|i = qn1|i = 0 . hence these annihilation conditions will be referred to as the
conventional, standard highest weight (h.w.) conditions. singular vectors that are not generated
by acting with the algebra on other singular vectors are called primitive, otherwise they are called
secondary singular vectors.

subsingular vectors are also null but they do not satisfy the h.w. conditions, becoming singular,
that is annihilated by all the positive generators, in the quotient of the verma module by a submod-
ule, however. as a consequence they are located outside that particular submodule (otherwise they
would disappear after taking the quotient), although descending to it necessarily by the action of
the lowering operators (so that they descend to nothing once the submodule is set to zero). this
implies that the singular vectors cannot reach the subsingular vectors going upwards by the action
of the negative, rising operators, whereas the subsingular vectors can reach the singular vectors
going downwards by the action of the positive, lowering operators.

subsingular vectors for the n=2 algebras were discovered in 1996 in ref.

[2] and the rst
examples for the case of the topological n=2 algebra were published in january 1997 in ref.
[1], together with the classication of all possible types of singular vectors taking into account the
relative u(1) charge and the annihilation conditions with respect to the fermionic zero modes g0 and
q0 (the brst-invariance properties). this classication resulted in: 4 dierent types of singular
vectors for chiral verma modules built on chiral highest weight vectors |0, hig,q, 20 dierent types
of singular vectors for generic (standard) verma modules (10 types built on g0-closed h.w. vectors
|, hig and 10 types built on q0-closed h.w. vectors |, hiq) and 9 dierent types of singular
vectors for no-label verma modules built on no-label indecomposable h.w. vectors |0, hi. in generic
verma modules one can nd g0-closed, q0-closed, chiral and no-label singular vectors. in chiral
and no-label verma modules, however, only g0-closed and q0-closed singular vectors can exist,
with the exception of the chiral singular vectors at level zero in no-label verma modules (curiously,
in chiral and no-label verma modules neither chiral nor no-label singular vectors exist). for the
case of the generic verma modules built on g0-closed h.w. vectors |, hig, which are of special
importance for the discussion that follows, the possible types of singular vectors one can nd are
given by the following table:

in ref.

[1] all singular vectors (i.e. 4 + 20 + 9) were written down explicitly at level 1. this
classication was proved to be rigorous later in ref. [6], where also the maximal dimensions of the
corresponding singular vector spaces were given (1, 2 or 3 depending on the type of singular vector).
regarding subsingular vectors, in ref. [1] all the subsingular vectors in generic verma modules that
become singular in the chiral verma modules were written down at levels 2 and 3. to understand
this one has to take into account that chiral verma modules are nothing but the quotient of generic
verma modules with zero conformal weight,  = 0, by the submodules generated by the level-zero
singular vectors (which are present in all generic verma modules with  = 0).

three months after ref.

[1] was published in hep-th/9701041 (january 97), the paper the
structure of verma modules over the n=2 superconformal algebra, by semikhatov and tipunin,
appeared in hep-th/9704111 [10]. in this paper the authors considered also the topological n=2
algebra, that they called the only n=2 algebra1. all the analysis and the results presented in this
paper were based on the following assumptions (without proofs):

i) in the n=2 verma modules there are only two types of submodules. in particular, in the
generic verma modules built on g0-closed h.w. vectors (called massive verma modules) one can
nd the two types, denoted as massive (large) and topological (small) submodules.

ii) these two types of submodules are maximally generated (i.e. without letting any null states
outside, like subsingular vectors) by some non-conventional singular vectors, constructed by the
authors in refs. [11] [12], which satisfy twisted h.w. conditions and coincide with the conventional
singular vectors only in the case of zero twist. in more intuitive terms one can think of the non-
conventional singular vectors simply as certain null states which, unlike the conventional singular
vectors, are not located at the bottom of the submodules, that is, they are not the null states with
lowest conformal weight, except for the case of zero twist.

let us notice already that, although ref. [1] appeared in the bibliography given by the authors,
the classication of verma modules (generic, no-label and chiral), with their possible existing types
of singular vectors, was overlooked. most surprising, from the very beginning they ignored no-label
singular vectors in the generic verma modules that they consider (called massive as we pointed
out before), as shown in table (1.3), which clearly do not t into the two types of submodules
described by the authors.

based on these assumptions the authors presented a complete classication of subsingular
vectors (without giving explicit examples) where, surprisingly, the subsingular vectors given in ref.
[1], which were the only explicit examples written down so far for the topological algebra, did not
t. in what follows, in subsections 2.1 and 2.2, we will show that:

i) in generic (massive) verma modules one can nd at least four dierent types of submodules.
two of them t, in principle, into the description of massive and topological submodules given

1although the topological and the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebras are related by the topological twists, and the
neveu-schwarz and the ramond n=2 algebras are related by the spectral ows, their representation theories are
dierent. this has not been appreciated by the authors who claim that the corresponding verma modules are
isomorphic, creating some confusion. in addition, the authors also claim that the topological and neveu-schwarz
n=2 algebras are related by the spectral ows, creating more confusion. furthermore there is also the twisted n=2
algebra (not to be confused with the twisted topological, i.e. the topological algebra) which is not connected to the
other three algebras.

by semikhatov and tipunin. the other two types do not t, clearly, into that description.

ii) the subsingular vectors written down in ref. [1] do not t into the classication presented
by the authors in ref. [10], providing in fact a proof that the non-conventional singular vectors do
not generate maximal submodules since one can nd subsingular vectors outside which are pulled
inside the submodule by the action of the positive lowering operators.

afterwards, in subsection 2.3, we will argue that the non-conventional singular vectors, con-
structed by semikhatov and tipunin in the papers [11] and [12], are poorly dened objects. they
are supposed to be related to some special types of singular vectors of the ane sl(2) algebra via an
isomorphism [16][17]. we will also make some remarks about this isomorphism and conclude that
it is far from satisfactory. the results discussed in this note aect profoundly the results presented
by semikhatov and collaborators in several other publications. this applies very specially to the
classication of n=2 embedding diagrams proposed (although never properly done) by semikhatov
and sirota in the paper [15], as we point out in subsection 2.4. in section 3 we will make some nal
remarks.

2 the facts

2.1 dierent types of submodules

in the recent paper [7] the determinant formulae for the topological n=2 algebra were presented
as well as a detailed analysis of the singular vectors corresponding to the roots of the determinants.
in addition it was proved  both theoretically and with explicit examples  that in generic verma
modules one can nd four dierent types of submodules just by taking into account the size and
the shape at the bottom of the submodules. now we will see that two of these types do not t into
the massive and topological submodules claimed to be the only existing types of submodules
by semikhatov and tipunin. the argument goes as follows. the determinant formula for all the
generic verma modules  either with two h.w. vectors |, hig and |, h  1iq ( 6= 0) or with
only one h.w. vector |0, hig or |0, h  1iq  reads2

2the verma modules built on g0-closed h.w. vectors and the ones built on q0-closed h.w. vectors are not the
same for zero conformal weight  = 0 because in this case there is only one h.w. vector at the bottom of the verma
module together with one singular vector. in some sense there is only one sector in the verma modules with  = 0,
as happens for the verma modules of the ramond n=2 algebra for  = c/24.

fr,s(, h, t 6= 0) = 2t(  r,s) ,

the fact that 2p (0) = 2pk(0) = 2 indicates that the singular vectors come two by two at the
same level, in the same verma module. generically one is in the g-sector, annihilated by (at least)
g0, while the other is in the q-sector, annihilated by (at least) q0. the roots of the quadratic
vanishing surface fr,s(, h, t) = 0 and of the vanishing planes g
k (, h, t) = 0 are related to the
corresponding roots of the determinant formula for the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra [23][24][25][26]
via the topological twists. these transform the standard h.w. vectors of the neveu-schwarz n=2
algebra into g0-closed h.w. vectors of the topological n=2 algebra. as a consequence, under the
topological twists, the neveu-schwarz singular vectors are transformed into the singular vectors of
the g-sector of the topological algebra (see refs.
[1][3] for a detailed account of the twisting and
untwisting of primary states and singular vectors).

it is easy to check, by counting of states, that the partitions 2p (l  rs

2 ), exponents of fr,s
in the determinant formula, correspond to complete verma submodules of generic type, whereas
the partitions 2pk(l  k), exponents of g
k in the determinant formula, correspond to incomplete
verma submodules3. furthermore, as pointed out before, taking into account also the shape at
the bottom one can distinguish four types of submodules. two of these types correspond to the

3the exponents of the determinant formulae for the neveu-schwarz and for the ramond n=2 algebras also show
the same behaviour: the exponents of the quadratic surfaces f a
r,s correspond to complete verma submodules
and the exponents of the planes ga
k correspond to incomplete verma submodules, where we use the notation
of ref. [23]. although this fact is very well known and is even explained explicitly in ref. [23], abundantly cited in ref.
[10], semikhatov and tipunin believed that they themselves had discovered that for n=2 algebras some submodules
are large, of the same size of the verma module itself, and some submodules are small. see the note at the end of
ref. [10] where they ask for credit for this fact referring to a paper by m. dorrzapf.

certain intersections of fr,s(, h, t) = 0 and g

k (, h, t) = 0, as we will explain.

2 : |i(0)g

in the g-sector and |i(0)q

the two types that correspond to the quadratic vanishing surfaces fr,s(, h, t) = 0, have there-
fore the same size (complete generic verma submodules). the dierence between them consists of
the shape at the bottom, where they both have (in the most general case  6= 0) two uncharged
in the q-sector4. an important
singular vectors at level l = rs
remark now is that if one chooses as h.w. vector of the verma module only the g0-closed one
|, hig, as semikhatov and tipunin do, regarding the q0-closed h.w. vector |, h  1iq simply
as a descendant state, then the singular vector |i(0)q
in the q-sector is necessarily described as
a negatively charged state |i(1)q
built on the h.w. vector |, hig. as shown in figure i, in
the most general case the bottom of the submodule consists of two singular vectors connected by
one or two horizontal arrows corresponding to q0 and/or g0. there is only one arrow if one of
the singular vectors is chiral, i.e. of type |i(0)g,q
instead, what happens generically for  = l.
these submodules t, in principle, into the description of massive submodules given by semikha-
tov and tipunin. namely, massive submodules are supposed to correspond to the uncharged roots
fr,s(, h, t) = 0, they have the same size as the generic (massive) verma module and they have
two states at the bottom connected through q0 and/or g0, one of these states being the g0-closed
uncharged singular vector |i(0)g
(they do not mention the possibility that this singular vector may
l
be chiral for  = l, though).

it also happens, however, for  = l, t =  s

n , n = 1, .., r, that the two singular vectors at the
bottom of the submodule are chiral both, and therefore disconnected from each other, as shown
in fig. i. consequently these chiral-chiral submodules, of the same size as the massive verma
modules and corresponding also to the uncharged roots fr,s(, h, t) = 0, contain two disconnected
pieces at the bottom and as a result do not t into the description of massive submodules. nor
do they t into the description of two topological (smaller) submodules since these correspond to
the charged roots g
at the bottom
of the submodules, as we will see.

or |i(1)g

let us stress that the existence of chiral-chiral submodules was obvious since january 1997
when the whole set of singular vectors of the topological algebra at level 1 was written down in
ref. [1]. for example, the chiral singular vectors |i(q)g,q
at level 1 built on g0-closed h.w. vectors
|, hig (which are the only h.w. vectors considered by semikhatov and tipunin) were shown to
be:

1

|i(0)g,q

1

= (2l1 + g1q0)|1, 1ig,

|i(1)g,q

1

= (l1q0 + h1q0 + q1)|1,

6  c

3

ig.

(2.10)

(2.11)

for c = 9 (t = 2) these two chiral singular vectors are together in the same generic (massive)

4for the case  = 0 there is only one h.w. vector in the verma module and therefore only one of the singular
vectors can be described as uncharged while the other must necessarily be described as charged with respect to the
unique h.w. vector. these details are however irrelevant for the present discussion.

of chiral-chiral submodules at level 1.

. the singular vectors corresponding to the series fr,s(, h, t) = 0 belong to two dierent types of submodules

whether  6= l or  = l, t 6=  s
n , n = 1, .., r (for which one of the singular vectors is chiral). in the second type,
corresponding to  = l, t =  s
n , n = 1, .., r, the two singular vectors are chiral and therefore disconnected from
each other, as shown in the gure on the right.

the third type of submodules, shown in fig.

in the q-sector for g+
in the q-sector for g

ii, corresponds to the roots of the vanishing
planes g
k (, h, t) = 0. as already pointed out, these are smaller, incomplete verma submodules
with partition functions pk(l  k). in the most general case ( 6= 0) the two singular vectors at the
bottom of the submodule can be described as charged: positively charged |i(1)g
in the g-sector
k (, h, t) = 0, and negatively charged |i(1)g
and |i(1)q
in the g-sector
and |i(1)q
k (, h, t) = 0. in each case one of the singular vectors becomes
chiral for  = l whereas the other singular vector does not. the bottom of these submodules is
always connected therefore as there is no analog to the chiral-chiral case of the uncharged singular
vectors. when the bottom of the submodule is at level zero in the verma module, then there
is only one singular vector, which consequently is chiral. these submodules seem to t well the
description of topological submodules given by semikhatov and tipunin. namely, they correspond
to the charged roots g
k (, h, t) = 0, they are smaller than the massive submodules and they have
one or two states at the bottom. in the rst case the unique state is charged and chiral (called
topological) while in the second case the two states are connected through g0 and/or q0, one of
k (, h, t) = 0) or |i(1)g
these states being the g0-closed charged singular vector |i(1)g

finally, the fourth type of submodules, shown also in fig.

ii, corresponds to the no-label
submodules. these are the widest submodules, with four singular vectors at the bottom, generated
by no-label singular vectors. these are primitive singular vectors that only exist for discrete values
of , h, t, in verma modules where there are intersections, at the same level l, of singular vectors
corresponding to the series fr,s(, h, t) = 0 with singular vectors corresponding to one of the series

r

, corresponding to t = 2

g
k (, h, t) = 0, with rs
2 = k = l and  = l. the values of c for which no-label singular vectors
exist are c = 3r6
[7] although
the existence of no-label singular vectors was proved in january 1997 in ref.
[1], since they were
explicitly written down at level 1 (shortly afterwards no-label singular vectors were written down
at level 2 in ref. [8]  this was even advertized in the abstract of the paper where it was proved
that no-label singular vectors of the topological algebra correspond to subsingular vectors of the
neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra under the topological twists).

no-label submodules

ii

fig.

. the singular vectors corresponding to the series g

k (, h, t) = 0 belong to only one type of submodules
(incomplete verma submodules).
in the generic case k 6= 0 there are two singular vectors at the bottom of the
submodules, connected by g0 and/or q0, depending on whether  6= l or  = l. (for k = 0, that is level zero, the
bottom of the submodule consists of only one singular vector which is chiral). the no-label singular vectors generate
the widest submodules with four singular vectors at the bottom.

the action of g0 and q0 on a no-label singular vector |i(q)

produce three secondary singular
vectors (one g0-closed, one q0-closed and one chiral) which cannot come back to the no-label
singular vector by acting with g0 and q0:

l

q0 |i(q)

l  |i(q1)q

l

, g0 |i(q)

l  |i(q+1)g

l

, g0 q0 |i(q)

l  |i(q)g,q

l

.

(2.12)

it happens that one of these singular vectors corresponds to the series fr,s(, h, t) = 0, another
one corresponds to the series g
k (, h, t) = 0, and the remaining one corresponds to both series.
hence the bottom of the no-label submodules is connected, generated by the no-label singular
vector and consists of four singular vectors: the primitive no-label singular vector and the three
secondary singular vectors. obviously, these submodules are wider than the massive submodules
(twice wider at the bottom, in fact) and do not t into the description of massive and topological
submodules.

in fig. iii one can see the case of an uncharged no-label singular vector |i(0)

l with the three
corresponding secondary singular vectors. the uncharged no-label singular vector |i(0)
1 at level 1,
built on a g0-closed h.w. vector |, hig, together with the three secondary singular vectors that it
generates at level 1 by the action of g0 and q0 read:

|i(0)

1,|1,1, t=2ig = (l1  h1)|1, 1, t = 2ig,

(2.13)

8

|i(1)g

1,|1,1, t=2ig = g0|i(0)

1,|1,1, t=2ig = 2g1|1, 1, t = 2ig,

|i(1)q

1,|1,1, t=2ig = q0|i(0)

1,|1,1, t=2ig = (l1q0  h1q0  q1)|1, 1, t = 2ig,

|i(0)g,q

1,|1,1, t=2ig = g0q0|i(0)

1,|1,1, t=2ig = 2(2l1 + g1q0)|1, 1, t = 2ig.

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

the no-label singular vector only exists for t = 2 (c = 3) whereas the three secondary singular
vectors are just the particular cases, for t = 2, of the one-parameter families of singular vectors of
the corresponding types, which exist for all values of t [1].

two important observations come now in order. first, a given submodule may not be completely
generated by the singular vectors at the bottom. these could generate only a submodule of the
whole (maximal) submodule, in which case one or more subsingular vectors generate the missing
parts. second, we have seen that there are four dierent types of submodules that may appear
in generic verma modules, distinguished by their size and/or the shape at the bottom of the
submodule. a more accurate classication of the submodules, however, should take into account
also the shape of the whole submodule, including the possible existence of subsingular vectors [33].
for this reason we claim that there are at least four dierent types of submodules in generic verma
modules.

we have shown so far that the two types of submodules proposed by semikhatov and tipunin
 massive and topological submodules  correspond, in principle, to the submodules of the rst
and third types, respectively, whereas the submodules of the second and fourth types (chiral-chiral

9

and no-label submodules) have been overlooked by the authors. (as a matter of fact, it is not
clear if chiral uncharged singular vectors |i(0)g,q
t in the framework of the authors at all since
they are completely ignored). furthermore the authors claim that the massive and topological
submodules are generated maximally (i.e. completely, without letting any null states outside) by
the non-conventional singular vectors that they constructed in refs. [11][12].

l

let us notice that the very existence of no-label singular vectors already disproves this claim
because no-label singular vectors (and many of their descendants) can be viewed as pieces left
outside from the topological and massive submodules. to be precise, no-label submodules contain
one topological and one massive submodule, starting at the bottom, but the no-label singular
vector, and many of its descendants, do not belong to these submodules. as a result the massive
and topological submodules together do not build the whole no-label submodule. consequently,
the non-conventional singular vectors together do not generate the maximal no-label submodule
(not even the bottom!). in the next subsection we will give another argument showing in a dierent
way that the non-conventional singular vectors do not generate maximal submodules: one can nd
subsingular vectors outside of them!

2.2 the classication of subsingular vectors

in order to understand the results presented by semikhatov and tipunin in ref.

[10] (and in
several other publications) we have to make two important remarks concerning the presentation of
the conventional singular vectors by the authors. first, the authors claim that in the conventional
approach the h.w. conditions imposed on the h.w. vectors and on any singular vector must include
the annihilation by g0 (eq.(2.11) in ref. [10]). this statement is incorrect since in the conventional
approach, for the (super)conformal algebras, one denes the h.w. vectors and singular vectors (often
called simply null vectors) as the states with lowest conformal weight (lowest energy) in the verma
modules and submodules, respectively. as a result, in most verma modules and submodules of the
ramond and the topological n=2 algebras (they are isomorphic in fact [7]) there are two sectors
degenerated in energy, the + and  sectors for the ramond algebra and the g and q sectors for the
topological algebra, the corresponding states annihilated by the fermionic zero modes g+
0 or g
0
and g0 or q0, respectively [23][25][26][27][28][29][7]. that is, at the bottom of most verma modules
and submodules of the ramond and of the topological n=2 algebras there are two h.w. vectors
and two singular vectors, respectively, the fermionic zero modes interpolating between them. in
addition, one can nd indecomposable singular vectors not annihilated by any of the fermionic zero
modes, that also must be called singular vectors following the conventional denition [1][8][6][7].

second, let us also notice that to break the symmetry between the g and the q sectors, regarding
the singular vectors of the q-sector simply as descendant states (non-singular) of the singular
vectors of the g-sector, leads to confusion in the case of zero conformal weight  + l = 0. the
reason is that for  + l = 0 the q0-closed (non-chiral) singular vectors |i(q)q
l= are in fact the
primitive ones generating the secondary singular vectors of the g-sector, which are necessarily
chiral of type |i(q+1)g,q
[7], appendix a). in the conventions used by
semikhatov and tipunin, however, the vectors |i(q)q
l= are not singular by denition. as a result,

(see the details in ref.

l=

10

since they are not descendant states of the singular vector |i(q+1)g,q
, but the other way around,
the singular vectors of the q-sector |i(q)q
l= must be called subsingular vectors instead. for similar
reasons, the indecomposable no-label singular vectors must also be called subsingular vectors (they
are not descendants of the singular vectors of the g-sector, but the other way around, and they are
not singular by denition).

l=

now we will see that the explicit examples of subsingular vectors given in ref.

[1], which are
singular in the chiral verma modules, do not t into the complete classication of subsingular
vectors presented by semikhatov and tipunin in ref.
[10]. as a consequence we will deduce
that the non-conventional singular vectors constructed in refs.
[11][12] do not generate maximal
submodules. the authors classied the generic verma modules built on g0-closed h.w. vectors
(massive verma modules) according whether they have zero, one, two or more singular vectors
from the uncharged and/or charged series associated to the roots of the determinant formula (in
our notation fr,s(, h, t) = 0 and/or g
k (, h, t) = 0). in every case they applied the assumption
that there are only two types of submodules  massive and topological  and these are generated
maximally by the non-conventional singular vectors constructed in refs.
[11][12]. namely, one
twisted topological non-conventional singular vector (where they mean twisted by the spectral
ows) is assumed to generate maximally one topological submodule whereas one twisted massive
non-conventional singular vector is assumed to generate maximally one massive submodule.

as pointed out before, these objects are null states that in general are not located at the bottom
of the submodules unlike the conventional singular vectors. in fact, in the cases when they lie at the
bottom then they coincide with the conventional singular vectors. an important remark is that the
twisted topological h.w. conditions satised by the twisted topological non-conventional singular
vectors reduce to the chirality h.w. conditions (i.e. annihilation by g0, q0 and by all the positive
generators) in the case of the twist parameter equal to zero. as a result, the zero twist topological
non-conventional singular vectors coincide with the chiral charged conventional singular vectors at
the bottom of the topological submodules. the claim that the non-conventional singular vectors
generate maximal submodules implies that acting with the lowering and raising operators of the
algebra one generates whole submodules without any null states left outside, such as subsingular
vectors and descendants of them, that can be pulled inside the submodules by the action of the
algebra.

using these assumptions and simple geometrical arguments, the authors deduced in which
cases the conventional singular vectors at the bottom of the submodules do not generate maximal
submodules, the remaining pieces outside being generated by subsingular vectors. in some of these
cases the authors gave general expressions for the subsingular vectors. the subsingular vectors
given by us in ref. [1] must correspond necessarily to the ones described by the authors in the case
codimension-2 charge-massive, given5 in proposition 3.9, for n = 0, since they are located in verma
modules with one charged chiral singular vector (at level zero, what gives n = 0) and one uncharged
g0-closed singular vector (and its companion in the q-sector that is ignored by the authors). in the
notation of the authors, who draw the verma modules upside-down, the charged singular vector is

5the authors themselves claimed that the subsingular vectors given in ref. [1] were described by proposition 3.9,
case n = 0 [35], although they did not explicitely mention this in the last revised, published version of ref. [10]. see
a comment in the final remarks regarding this issue.

11

both a conventional top-level singular vector and a non-conventional twisted topological charged
singular vector |e(n)ich with twist parameter n = 0 (i.e. the non-conventional singular vector is
at the bottom of the submodule so that it coincides with the conventional singular vector). the
uncharged g0-closed singular vector is described as the conventional top-level uncharged singular
vector in the massive submodule generated by the massive singular vector |s(r, s)i , and is
denoted as |si.

for this case, and in fact for all cases described by proposition 3.9, the authors deduced that a
subsingular vector |subi must exist inside the maximal massive submodule generated by |s(r, s)i in
the sense that |subi is located outside the non-maximal submodule generated by the conventional
uncharged singular vector |si, becoming singular once |si is set to zero. this implies that the
subsingular vector |subi is pushed down (up in the authors gures) by the action of the lowering
operators inside the non-maximal submodule generated by |si, so that setting this submodule to
zero is equivalent to push down the vector to nothing, i.e. the subsingular vector becomes singular.
observe that in this case the subsingular vector |subi, once it reaches |si by the action of the
lowering operators, cannot go down (up) anymore since |si is the conventional singular vector
at the bottom of the submodule annihilated by all the lowering operators. in other words, if the
subsingular vector |subi becomes singular when |si is set to zero, then acting with the lowering
operators on |subi it cannot be pulled down beyond the level of |si, getting in fact stuck in |si
(up to constants).

the subsingular vectors at level 3 given by us in ref. [1] do not follow the behaviour described
by proposition 3.9, however. rather, they are pulled down beyond the uncharged conventional
singular vector |si that one nds at level 2 and, in fact, they can be pulled down until the very end,
i.e. level zero, becoming singular only when the charged chiral singular vector |e(0)ich at level zero
is set to zero. as a consequence, these subsingular vectors do not become singular when |si is set
to zero, what implies that they are not pulled inside the submodule generated by |si by the action
of the lowering operators (see fig.
iv), and therefore they are not located inside the maximal
massive submodule supposed to be generated by the massive singular vector |s(r, s)i. but these
subsingular vectors are neither located inside the submodule generated by |e(0)ich since they do not
disappear when |e(0)ich is set to zero, becoming singular rather. in other words, as shown in fig.
iv, these subsingular vectors are pulled inside the submodule generated by |e(0)ich by acting with
the lowering operators. this implies that the submodule generated by the non-conventional singular
vector |e(0)ich is not maximal, in contradiction with the claims of semikhatov and tipunin.

iv . when the charged level zero singular vector |e(0)ich = q0|0, 2ig is set to zero, the generic (massive)
fig.
verma module v (|0, 2ig) is divided by the submodule generated by this singular vector. as a result one obtains the
incomplete, chiral verma module v (|0, 2ig,q) built on the chiral h.w. vector |0, 2ig,q. the subsingular vector |subi(1)
3
at level 3 is outside the submodule generated by |e(0)ich, being pulled inside by the action of the lowering operators.
consequently, the submodule generated by the non-conventional topological charged singular vector |e(0)ich (which
being at the bottom of the submodule coincides with the conventional chiral singular vector q0|0, 2ig) is not maximal
since there is (at least) one subsingular vector left outside. this subsingular vector becomes singular, therefore, in the
chiral verma module v (|0, 2ig,q) obtained after the quotient. inside the submodule generated by |e(0)ich one nds
the uncharged g0-closed singular vector |si (and its companion in the q-sector that is not indicated). the subsingular
vector |subi(1)
is not pulled inside the submodule generated by |si by the lowering operators and therefore it does
not become singular once |si is set to zero. as a result |subi(1)
3 does not belong to the massive submodule, supposed
to be generated by the non-conventional massive singular vector |s(r, s)i, having |si at the bottom.

3

this example not only proves that proposition 3.9 is incorrect, as |subi(1)

3 does not become
[1] (the only
singular when |si is set to zero, and that the subsingular vectors presented in ref.
examples known at that time!) do not t into the complete classication of subsingular vectors
given by semikhatov and tipunin in ref. [10]. as we have just discussed, this example also proves
that the non-conventional topological singular vector |e(0)ich = q0|0, 2ig (which is located at
the bottom of the submodule and therefore coincides with the conventional chiral singular vector)
does not generate a maximal submodule since the subsingular vector |subi(1)
is outside this
3
submodule, being pulled inside by the action of the lowering operators. this example disproves the
claim of semikhatov and tipunin that their non-conventional massive and topological singular
vectors generate maximal submodules with no space left outside for subsingular vectors. indeed,
we have shown that the subsingular vector |subi(1)
is neither generated by the massive singular
3
vector |s(r, s)i nor by the topological singular vector |e(0)ich, nor by both of them together. as
a result, this example proves that the non-conventional massive and topological singular vectors
constructed by semikhatov and tipunin do not generate maximal submodules.

13

2.3 the non-conventional singular vectors and the isomorphism n=2  sl(2)

we will argue now that the non-conventional singular vectors of semikhatov and tipunin, apart
from the fact that they do not generate maximal submodules, are poorly dened objects of unclear
meaning (except for some simple cases).

on the one hand, the key idea underlying the construction of these non-conventional singular
[11] and [12] was the misconception that the spectral ows map h.w. vectors to
vectors in refs.
h.w. vectors (for any value of the parameter !) transforming the verma modules into isomorphic
verma modules, consequently6.
(the fact that the spectral ows do not map h.w. vectors to
h.w. vectors, except for some specic values of , was already pointed out by schwimmer and
seiberg just a few lines after they wrote down the spectral ows in ref. [30], abundantly cited by
semikhatov and tipunin. an exhaustive analysis of this issue for the even and the odd spectral
ows can be found in ref.
[5]). to be precise, the authors claimed that the spectral ows do not
act only on the states but also on the h.w. conditions in such a way that the h.w. vectors always
remain h.w. vectors under any spectral ow transformation. (observe that transforming the states
and the observables, like the h.w. conditions, at the same time is equivalent to not doing any
transformation at all, just a redenition of the states in the same verma module). one can see this
misconception abundantly used in ref. [11]. in the last version of ref. [12] (sept. 1998), however,
the corresponding misleading statements have been removed everywhere in the paper. intriguingly
enough, all the nal expressions and results have remained the same.

on the other hand, the non-conventional singular vectors are constructed out of continued
operators or intertwiners, g(a, b) and q(a, b), that generalize the products of fermionic modes
gaga+1ga+2......ga+n and qaqa+1qa+2......qa+n , respectively, to a complex number of factors.
the authors claim that this procedure is analogous to the analytical continuation of malikov-
feigin-fuchs for ane lie algebras [31], for which complex exponents of the generators are used.
we disagree with this view because the complex exponents for the ane lie algebras, used also
by kent for the virasoro algebra [32], involve only well dened generators of the algebra under
study. the intertwiners g(a, b) and q(a, b), however, are made out of a continuum of generators
of types g and q, with  a complex number, that do not belong to the topological n=2 algebra
(1.1) under study, except for  integer, mixing in fact a continuum of dierent n=2 algebras.
furthermore, the authors postulate a number of properties and results for g(a, b) and q(a, b) that
they call a consistent set of algebraic rules.
in this set, however, important commutators are
absent: [g(a, b), q], [q(a, b), g] and [g(a, b), q(a, b)].

finally, underlying the construction of the non-conventional singular vectors and the idea that
they generate maximal submodules, is the authors claim [16][17][15] that the topological and
massive non-conventional singular vectors of the n=2 algebra (see footnote 1) are in one-to-

6this is also the reason why they believed that the verma modules of the neveu-schwarz and the ramond n=2
algebras were isomorphic. we tried to warn the authors, unsuccesfully, about their wrong use of the spectral ows.
we also suggested to them to use the involutive automorphism a that we had deduced in ref. [4], eq. (2.8), acting
3 , gn  qn and qn  gn, with a1 = a. this suggestion was followed by
as lm  lm  mhm, hm  hm  c
the authors, but without citing our work, as the reader can see in ref. [12], eq. (2.7), and in ref. [18], eq. (2.17).

one correspondence with the conventional and relaxed singular vectors of the ane sl(2) algebra,
respectively. the relaxed h.w. vectors and singular vectors have neither clear meaning nor intrinsic
interest from the point of view of the ane sl(2) algebra. they are not annihilated by any of the
zero modes j0, unlike the conventional singular vectors, and they satisfy a very strong constraint
(apparently in order to mimic some fermionic properties of the n=2 algebra). they have been
introduced by the authors with the unique purpose to create an isomorphism between the verma
modules and submodules of the n=2 algebra and the verma modules and submodules of the ane
sl(2) algebra. the authors claim that the topological and massive submodules generated by the
topological and massive singular vectors of the n=2 algebra are isomorphic to the conventional
and relaxed submodules generated by the conventional and relaxed singular vectors of the ane
sl(2) algebra, respectively7. the crucial point now is that the latter must be maximal submodules
since in the ane sl(2) algebra subsingular vectors are not supposed to exist. as a consequence,
the submodules generated by the topological and massive non-conventional singular vectors of
the n=2 algebra must be also maximal. but we have proved in the previous subsection, using a
counterexample, that these submodules are not maximal. therefore there are only two alternatives:
either the isomorphism n=2  sl(2) proposed by the authors fails or there exist subsingular
vectors in the verma-like modules (conventional and relaxed verma modules) of the ane sl(2)
algebra. we believe that the isomorphism fails for two reasons. first, as we pointed out in the
paragraphs above, the n=2 non-conventional singular vectors, which are the n=2 counterpart of
the isomorphism, are objects of very unclear nature. in our opinion, it is not even clear that they
belong to any verma modules and/or submodules of the topological n=2 algebra, as claimed by
the authors. second, the isomorphism already fails, in its present form, because in the relaxed
verma modules, which are the sl(2) partners of the generic massive n=2 verma modules, no
submodules have been found that could be the partners of the chiral-chiral or of the no-label
n=2 submodules. as a matter of fact, it seems a highly non-trivial task to nd the sl(2) partners
of the no-label singular vectors (that in the notation used by the authors should be called no-label
subsingular vectors instead, as we have explained before). we think that these partners simply do
not exist.

2.4 the n=2 embedding diagrams

the same misleading ideas used by semikhatov and tipunin to obtain the degeneration pat-
terns and classication of subsingular vectors in ref. [10], were used afterwards by semikhatov and
sirota in ref. [15], where they presented a prescription to obtain a classication of n=2 embedding
diagrams. that is, they applied again the assumption that in n=2 verma modules there are sub-
modules of exactly two dierent types  the (twisted) massive and the (twisted) topological ones
and arbitrary sums thereof  and the assumption that these submodules are generated maximally
by the (twisted) massive and the (twisted) topological non-conventional singular vectors. hence

7the precise claim is that the twisted topological and twisted massive singular vectors and submodules of the
n=2 algebra are isomorphic to the twisted conventional and twisted relaxed singular vectors and submodules of
the ane sl(2) algebra, respectively, where twisted refers to the corresponding spectral ows. for convenience we
have dropped the word twisted in all this paragraph.

15

it seems that there is no need to add any more comments to this issue. nevertheless, there are two
important remarks to be added.

first, the authors did not present a single n=2 embedding diagram in [15] (in spite of their
claims).
instead they presented a classication of embedding diagrams of the sl(2) verma-like
structures, for which there are only two types of submodules and these are generated maximally
by their corresponding singular vectors. then the authors proposed the isomorphism that we
have discussed in the previous subsection, between the n=2 verma modules and submodules and
the sl(2) verma-like modules and submodules, and nally the reader was supposed to apply this
isomorphism to obtain, after working for several weeks, the sought n=2 embedding diagrams. (in
the abstract of the paper, the rst sentence reads however: we classify and explicitly construct the
embedding diagrams of verma modules over the n=2 supersymmetric extension of the virasoro
algebra).

second, the authors did not compare their classication of n=2 embedding diagrams with the
most complete classication done so far on this issue, due to dorrzapf in 1995 [9] (ph. d. thesis,
cambridge). the authors did not even mention this important work of dorrzapf, abundantly
referred, however, in some references cited by the authors8.

3 final remarks

in january 97 our paper [1] appeared in hep-th. as was indicated in the abstract, all the singular
vectors at level 1 of the topological n=2 algebra were presented, as well as the subsingular vectors
which become singular in chiral verma modules at levels 2 and 3. semikhatov and tipunin only
needed to look (literally!) at the singular vectors at level 1 to realize straightforwardly that their
classication of submodules was incomplete as there is no place left for no-label singular vectors
neither for chiral-chiral pairs of uncharged singular vectors. moreover, the authors only needed
to check the few examples of subsingular vectors, which were the only examples known in the
literature, to nd out that their classication of subsingular vectors was incorrect and their claim
that the non-conventional singular vectors generate maximal submodules was also incorrect. these
incorrect claims they published however three months after, in april 97 in ref. [10]. furthermore in
august 97 they sent to hep-th a revised version of that paper, accepted for publication in comm.
math. phys., in which they added several misleading claims about our subsingular vectors in ref.
[1]. the most disturbing claim was that they were subsingular (instead of singular) in the chiral
verma modules.

because of these incorrect claims we contacted the editors of comm. math. phys. who very
kindly stopped the publication of the paper [10] in order for the authors to revise the paper. we

8this is most intriguing because the classication of n=2 embedding diagrams in the thesis of dorrzapf was well
known to semikhatov as it was shown to him in durham during the academic year 1995-96 and he even borrowed
the thesis for a few days. in addition, semikhatov sent an e-mail to dorrzapf in december 1997 where he admitted
to know the work on n=2 embedding diagrams in his thesis [34]. in spite of these facts semikhatov has kept ignoring
the classication of n=2 embedding diagrams by dorrzapf also in the papers [18], [12] and [19] that followed ref. [15].

also pointed out, among several other remarks, that: i) all the results presented in [10] were based
on the assumption that there are only two dierent types of submodules in n=2 verma modules,
without giving any proof for this strong claim, ii) our classication of h.w. vectors was completely
overlooked, in particular no-label h.w. vectors were ignored, and iii) our subsingular vectors, which
are singular in chiral verma modules, did not t into the classication of subsingular vectors given
by the authors.

the authors replied to the editors that they had in fact misclassied the subsingular vectors
in ref. [1], but however they were described by proposition 3.9 case n = 0. (in this note we have
proved that this is not the case). they also assured that they did not take into account no-label
singular vectors because they do not exist in generic (massive) verma modules (in ref.
[1] we
had proved, however, that no-label singular vectors only exist in generic verma modules and one
can see this also in the explicit examples at level 1) . they also assured that the spectral ows
transform not only the states but also the h.w. conditions in such a way that the h.w. vectors
are always mapped into h.w. vectors, for any spectral ow transformation (they also assured that
the verma modules of the neveu-schwarz n=2 algebra are isomorphic to the verma modules of
the ramond n=2 algebra for this reason). in spite of this misleading reply the paper was nally
published, although with several improvements.

in november 98 we explained the content of this note to the authors, in particular we gave them
the proof, step by step, that their topological and massive non-conventional singular vectors do
not generate maximal submodules.
in spite of this the authors (who never replied to us) still
published, in nucl. phys. b, the paper [18] with the usual assumptions that there are only two
types of submodules,... for example one can read in the second paragraph below eq. (3.6) the
statement: ...these singular vectors (the topological ones) generate maximal submodules, which is
crucial for the resolution to have precisely the form (3.2) ....

finally we would like to point out that the facts discussed in this note aect drastically the

results presented in refs. [10]  [18] and less importantly also the results presented in ref. [19].
