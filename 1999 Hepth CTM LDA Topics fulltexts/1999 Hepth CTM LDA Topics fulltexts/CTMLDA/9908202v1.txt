we study the supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems that arise from dis-
crete light cone quantization of theories with minimal supersymmetry in various
dimensions. these systems which have previously arisen in the study of black hole
moduli spaces, are distinguished by having fewer fermionic elds than the famil-
iar kahler and hyper-kahler models. this is a contribution to the yuri golfand
memorial volume.

1 preface

in the three decades since the pioneering works,1 supersymmetry has steadily
grown both in importance and in depth. it is the most widely anticipated form
of new physics to be seen near the weak scale; it is central to the structure
of string theory; it is the key to the recent understanding of nonperturbative
physics both in eld theory and string theory; it is the focal point of many con-
nections between mathematics and physics; and, it appears to be the principle
that is responsible for cancellation of quantum corrections, stabilizing both the
weak symmetry breaking scale and spacetime itself. it seems likely that we
still have much to learn in these and other directions.

even in quantum mechanics, supersymmetry has many applications. most
recently, through discrete light cone quantization, supersymmetric quantum
mechanics has been proposed as a nonperturbative formulation of m theory and
other exotic systems. supersymmetric quantum mechanics is in some ways less
constrained than supersymmetric eld theory, due to the reduced spacetime
symmetry. for example, there is no direct relation between the number of
bosonic and fermionic elds (quantum mechanical coordinates). in this paper
we study some supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems that arise from
the discrete light cone quantization of theories with minimal supersymmetry
in various dimensions. these are distinguished by having fewer fermionic elds
than the familiar kahler and hyper-kahler models.

2 introduction

light-cone quantization 2 has played an important role in eld and string the-
ory.
in this description, free quanta satisfy nonrelativistic kinematics, with
the positive spatial momentum p playing the role of the mass. of particu-
lar interest is discrete light-cone quantization (dlcq),3 in which the light-like
spatial direction is compact. in this case p is quantized as well as positive, so
that a sector of given total p contains only a nite number of nonrelativistic
particles. this has been used for numerical and analytic study of quantum eld
theories, and recently has been used to provide a nonperturbative denition of
m theory.4

in recent work5,6 we have attempted to employ dlcq to study weak/strong
duality in supersymmetric gauge theories. this has required a version of dlcq
that preserves this duality, the so-called light-like limit (lll). this is more
complicated than the usual dlcq, in that one must in many cases solve a
dynamical problem just to obtain the dlcq hamiltonian:
it is an eective
hamiltonian in the wilsonian sense, rather than a simple reduction of the
original hamiltonian.

given this complication, it is useful to take maximum advantage of super-
symmetry to restrict the form of the hamiltonian. we are thus interested in
various supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems. in this paper we focus
on eld theories with minimal (unextended) supersymmetry in various dimen-
sions, because these lead to supersymmetric qm systems that are somewhat
unfamiliar. the more general context of dlcq and lll will be discussed in
a forthcoming paper.6

let us begin with some simple counting. we start with a eld theory in d
spacetime dimensions with n real supersymmetry charges. the nonrelativistic
particles move in the d  2 transverse dimensions. a sector with k particles
is then described by quantum mechanics with nb = k(d  2) real bosonic
coordinates.
2n dynamical charges q and 1
2n

the supersymmetries separate into 1

kinematical charges q, with the algebra

{q, q} = 2p+  2h ,
{q, q} = 2i
pi ,
{q, q} = 2p .

(1)

we can work in an eigenbasis for p so that the q are essentially oscillator
variables. the system can be separated into center-of-mass variables (q, pi)
and the rest. the algebra of the q determines how the center-of-mass vari-
ables enter into q and h but does not otherwise constrain the theory. the

essential problem is then supersymmetric quantum mechanics with nq = 1
2n
supercharges q. to count the fermionic coordinates, consider rst a single
particle. it has 2n /4 spin states, which can be thought of as generated by the
qa.a a state with k particles thus has 2kn /4 states. these would be described
by quantizing nf = 1
2 kn real fermionic coordinates, with action rst order in
time. in table 1 we give the count of real bosonic and fermionic coordinates in
3  d  10, for the minimal supersymmetry algebra in each dimension.
consider the case of d = 6, where there are four supercharges. super-
symmetric qm with nq = 4 can be obtained by dimensional reduction from
the familiar d = 4, n = 1 nonlinear sigma models,7 giving qm on a kahler
space. a space with 4k bosonic coordinates can be described with 2k chiral
superelds, each having complex scalar. each chiral supereld also contains
two complex fermion elds, giving a total of 8k real fermion elds. under
dimensional reduction to qm, each eld becomes a coordinate. from table 1,
the number of fermionic coordinates in the kahler models is twice that in the
dlcq theory, so the latter are not of the familiar type. note from the table
that in dimensions 3, 4, 6, and 10 the numbers of bosonic and fermion coor-
dinates are equal. in other dimensions the number of fermionic coordinates is
greater, but always less than would be obtained with d = 4, n = 1 superelds.
after some work on this problem, we learned that the quantum mechanical
systems with nb = nf (as in d = 3, 4, 6, 10) had already been constructed in
some detail by gibbons, papadopoulos, and stelle,8 based on earlier work of
coles and papadopoulos; 9 they have been further analyzed in a recent paper
by michelson and strominger.10 the physical motivation was dierent, namely

awe are interested in particles that are massless (or bps) in d dimensions, and so transform
in small multiplets.

3

the study of black hole moduli spaces. the qm systems for d = 4, 6, and
10 are respectively the 2a, 4a, and 8a models of those authors (for d = 3,
where nq = 1, the models are constructed with standard superelds). the
supersymmetry multiplets cannot be obtained by dimensional reduction from
four dimensions, but they can be obtained dimensional reduction of the (2, 0),
(4, 0), and (8, 0) multiplets in two dimensions. not all quantum mechani-
cal lagrangians can be obtained by dimensional reduction, because the one-
dimensional theory has less spacetime symmetry.

in this paper we will describe some small extensions of the earlier work
on these models. first, we show how the the 4a theories can be constructed
with d = 1, n = 4 superelds (the reduction of the familiar d = 4, n = 1
superelds) with an extra constraint; the previous work used d = 1, n = 1
superelds. second, we consider the addition of a gauge eld on moduli space.
finally, we show how models with nb < nf can be obtained by a reduction
of those with nb = nf ; a new feature here is that a potential energy term
can arise.

3 supereld description of the 4a theories

to deduce the eld content we consider the states of a free massless particle
in six dimensions. the 6-dimensional supersymmetry algebra has an su (2)
r-symmetry. under so(5, 1)  su (2)r the supercharge transforms as (4, 2).
the dlcq breaks this to so(4) su (2)r = su (2)1 su (2)2 su (2)r. the
supercharge decomposes

( 1
2 , 2, 1, 2) : qax
( 1
qmx ,
2 , 1, 2, 2) :

(2)

where the  1
2 is the transformation under the longitudinal so(1, 1). indices
a, . . ., m, . . ., and x, . . . are used to label doublets of the three su (2)s. the
supercharges satisfy a reality condition

q

ax = abxy qby ,

q
mx = mn xy qn y .

(3)

on a massless particle with p+ = 0, the qax vanish while the qmx gener-
ate the spin states. in the quantum mechanics, the latter role is played by the
quantized fermionic coordinates , so we can identify these as transforming as
mx with the same reality condition as the qmx . the bosonic coordinates
are vectors of so(4) and so transform as xam , again with a reality condition:

x 

am = abmn xbn ,


mx = mn xy n y .

(4)

4

we can readily write down the supersymmetry algebra for a free particle,

[qax , xb
{qax, m

m ] = 2abm
y } = i2xy xa

x ,
m .

(5)

we use conventions of wess and bagger.11 for example, 12 = 21 = +1, and
indices are raised and lowered by left-multiplication with .

now let us compare with the superelds obtained by dimensional reduction
from d = 4. we should emphasize that dimensional reduction and dlcq,
while they both lead to supersymmetric qm, are completely dierent. the
dlcq takes a quantum eld theory in d dimensions to qm in d  2 spatial
dimensions. reduction takes quantum eld theory in d dimensions to quan-
tum eld theory in 1 dimension (time), where the elds are reinterpreted as
coordinates.

to get the right number of bosons we take two chiral superelds i. in
addition to the doublet index i there is a doublet index  on the superspace
coordinates  and a doublet index  on their conjugates. because the reduction
breaks so(3, 1) to so(3), indices  and  transform in the same way. the
superderivative algebra reduces to

{d, d } = 2i 


t

.

the supersymmetry transformations of the scalar components are

[q, ai] = 2i
 ,
[q, ai] = 0 ,

(6)

(7)

and the conjugate relations. the dlcq and supereld transformations are of
the same form provided we identify

q = q2x(cid:12)(cid:12)x= , ai = x1

m(cid:12)(cid:12)m=i , i

 = m

x(cid:12)(cid:12)x=,m=i .

(8)

(9)

notice in particular that ai is then ijx j
2.
from the introduction we know that the supereld description has twice
as many fermion elds as the dlcq. here this arises because the latter satisfy
the reality condition,

 = ijj
i
 .

this can be incorporated into the supereld formalism by the new constraint

d i = ij dj ,

5

(10)

which is in addition to the usual chiral constraint d j = 0. this has no
eect on the lowest, bosonic, components ai, while eliminating half of the
fermionic components. it also eliminates the auxiliary components in terms of
the velocities.

to describe k free particles one would use k pairs of superelds, with the
constraint eq. 10 on each. to obtain a general interacting theory we must
consider the generalization

d i = j

j 

(, )dj .

(11)

this nonlinear constraint must be consistent, meaning that it represents only
the same number of constraints as the linearized version eq. 10, eliminating
the auxiliary elds and half the fermions, and leaving the lowest components
unconstrained. first, from the conjugate of eq. 11 we obtain

j

j 

(j 

k 

) = 



k 

second, acting on both sides with d  gives

d  d i = j


j 

,k

d  kdj + 2ij

j 

 tj .

(12)

(13)

focus on the lowest component of this equation. the lhs is antisymmetric in
 ; in order that this equation not constrain the velocities, but just eliminate
the auxiliary eld, the second term on the rhs must also be antisymmetric in
 . thus,

(, ) = j

j(, )  ,

where j j
from the rst term on the rhs, and can now be written

k). the part of eq. 13 which is symmetric in   comes only

0 = j

j,kj

k

l(dldj + dldj)

(15)

the expression in parentheses is antisymmetric in lj. in order that eq. 15 not
represent new constraints on the elds we need that it hold identically, and so

k

j

[lj

j],k = 0 .

(16)

finally, acting on both sides of eq. 11 with d and using the constraints gives

2iti = j

j,kdkdj + j

jddj .

(17)

the antisymmetric part of this again relates the auxiliary eld to the veloci-
ties. only the rst term on the rhs has a symmetric part, and its vanishing
identically implies

j

[j,k] = 0

6

(18)

eqs. 14, 16, and 18 imply consistency of the constraints: for example, one
can regard them as determining the derivatives of i with respect to 1, 2,
and 2, and these are integrable. they imply

for the components of 11

2 ,

i = ai(y) + 2i(y) + f i(y) ,

where y = t  i   .
follows. eq. 14 implies that the tensor i2 dened by

the geometric interpretation of the constraint eqs. 14, 16, and 18 is as

i2(cid:20) i

i (cid:21) = (cid:20) j i

j

j
jj (cid:21)

(21)

is an almost complex structure. this is in addition to the usual complex
structure

(19)

(20)

(22)

i1(cid:20) i

i (cid:21) = (cid:20)

ii

i i (cid:21)

of the supereld formalism. eqs. 16 and 18 are then the vanishing of the
nijenhuis tensor for i2, written in the complex coordinates associated to i1.
thus i1 is a complex structure, as is i3 = i1i2 = i2i1, in agreement with the
conditions found previously.8

an invariant action is given by the superspace invariant

z dt d4 k(, ) .

(23)

this automatically satises the geometric conditions for supersymmetry from
refs. 8,10 though we have not shown that all solutions are of this form.b the
bosonic kinetic term is

k,i(a, a)( ai aj + f if j) = k,i(a, a)( ai aj + j i

kj 

l al ak)

(24)

introducing general real coordinates xa, the metric on moduli space can be
written symmetrically among the three complex structures,

gab =

xr=0

d
c
ir

bk,cd ,

(25)

where i0 is the identity.
bthe superspace formalism is not essential here; once the transformation laws are determined
one can take the fourth variation of a scalar function.

4 gauge fields on moduli space

a small generalization of previous work is to add a gauge eld on moduli space.
we will do this both with d = 1, n = 1 superelds, following ref. 8, and the
d = 1, n = 4 superelds above.

in n = 1 superelds we add a term

s  = z dt d aadx a

(26)

where the lowest component of x a is the real coordinate xa. under the varia-
tion

the variation of the action is

x a = i a

rbdx b ,

s  = z dt d (aa,bx bdx a + aadx a)

= z dt d (aa,b  ab,a)dx bx a
= z dt d fabi a

rcdx bdx c .

by antisymmetry of dx bdx c,

fabi a

rc + fcai a

rb = 0 .

(27)

(28)

(29)

thus the condition for 4a supersymmetry is that the indices of fab be mixed
 f be a (1,1)-form  in all three complex structures.

in n = 4 superelds consider the half-superspace integral

s  = z dt d2 w (, ) + c.c.

= iw,ij i

 aj + fermionic + c.c. .

aj = iw,j

j , a = iw 

,j i

 .

(30)

(31)

so that

we do not assume w to be holomorphic, but will see how it is constrained by
supersymmetry. the supersymmetry variation of s  is the integral of a total
derivative except for the  derivative

z dt d2 w,d i + c.c. = iz dt d2 ajdj + c.c.

(32)

8

using constraint eq. 11. in order that this integrate to zero, we must have
aj = ,j for some , or equivalently

fjk = fk = 0 .

thus f is (1,1) with respect to i1. eq. 31 is equivalent to

k]a ,
using eq. 18. together with its conjugate this implies

a) = j[i

0 = [k(ji]

j[i

fk] = 0 ,

(33)

(34)

(35)

which is the statement that f is (1,1) with respect to both i2 and i3. thus
we recover the same models as with n = 1 superelds.c

5 dimensional reduction

systems with nb < nf can be obtained from those with nb = nf by a
process of reduction. this requires that the original system have one or more
isometries. with a single isometry, for example, we can choose coordinates
in which it takes the form  = . then  does not appear in the action
undierentiated, and so  can be regarded as an independent auxiliary eld f .
in n = 1 supereld language, the corresponding supereld  does not
appear in the action but d may. the lower component of d is a fermion
and the upper is   f . such superelds, with a fermion and an auxiliary
eld, were considered in ref. 9, where they were denoted . they can be used
to construct models with nf > nb. however, it appears that not all such
models can be obtained by dimensional reduction: we can work backwards,
introducing a supereld  and replacing  everywhere with d, only if the
supersymmetry variations of  are total spinor derivatives. for d = 1, n = 1
systems this is always possible, but for higher supersymmetries it is nontrivial.
this reduction process is suggested by the application to dlcq: the sys-
tems in table 1 having nb < nf can be obtained from those with nb = nf
by dimensional reduction. for example we can go from the d = 6 system to
the d = 5 system by kaluza-klein reduction on x4. in a k-particle system, all
wavefunctions will be independent of x4, so there are actually k isometries.

ceq. 34 would appear to be stronger than eq. 35, but the dierence is a gauge choice. the
earlier eq. 33 implies that aj = j  and a = (). the real part of  can be set to zero
by a gauge transformation, and then eqs. 34 and 35 are equivalent.

5.1 examples

let us illustrate the reduction for the 4a theory with a single isometry. the
general bosonic action with an isometry is

1
2

gmn xm xn +

1
2

g(  + a

m xm)2 + am xm + a  .

(36)

here m, n run only over the 4k  1 non-cyclic coordinates. note the kaluza-
klein gauge eld on moduli space a
m, which is in addition to the gauge eld
(am,a4) introduced in section 4. replacing   f and solving for f gives

1
2

gmn xm xn

2g a2

 + (am  aa

m) xm .

(37)

/2g is introduced. the net reduced gauge eld

m is invariant under reparameterization of    + (xm).

thus a potential energy a2
am  aa
now let us begin with the simplest example, k = 1 with the linear con-
straint eq. 10 and no gauge eld. the bosonic action in eq. 24 takes the
form

(k,11 + k,22)( a1 a1 + a2 a2) .

(38)

(39)

in real coordinates this is

1
2

h(xa) xb xb ,

where h = 2k is a generic function of x1, x2, x3, x4. this example appears
in refs. 12,8.
now reduce under translation in x4. to make the result more interesting
add a constant potential a4 = c1. then h depends only on xm  x1, x2, x3
and the reduced bosonic action is

1
2

h(xm) xn xn 

c2
1

2h(xm)

.

(40)

focusing now on systems with spherical symmetry we have h = h(r). an

obvious generalization is to add a spherically symmetric magnetic eld

bm =

c2xm

r3

,

a4 = c1 +

c2
r

.

(41)

the form of a4 follows from the (1,1) condition on f , which here reduces to
self-duality. the reduced action is then

1
2

h(r) xn xn 

1

2h(r)(cid:18)c1 +

c2

r (cid:19)2

+ am xm .

(42)

10

an independent search for spherically symmetric quantum mechanical sys-
tems produced a further one-parameter generalization of these models. the
bosonic actions are all of the form eq. 42; the generalization appears in the
supersymmetry transformations and consequently the fermionic terms. these
models can be obtained from reduction as follows. for k = 1 there is a one-
parameter generalization of the complex structures, given by taub-nut space,
with the constant complex structure as a limit. this space has an su (2)u (1)
isometry, so reducing on the u (1) leaves a theory with su (2) rotational sym-
metry.

5.2 taub-nut reduction

in the remainder of this paper we work out some of the (rather tedious)
details of this reduction, beginning with the bosonic action.
in coordinates
(x1, x2, x3, ) with  cyclic, the three complex structures are 13

a = cos  .

(44)

after some computation, one nds from eq. 25 that the general metric with a
u (1) isometry is

ds2 = h(xm)(cid:2)dxndxn + s2(d + andxn)2(cid:3) ,

(45)

where h = mmk and k is independent of . for h = 2ms this is the
hyper-kahler taub-nut metric, so these metrics are conformal to taub-nut.

11

we now add a gauge eld aa. we nd it convenient to impose rotational
invariance before the (1, 1) condition. the condition that the gauge eld term
aa xa be invariant up to a time derivative under a general killing vector la is
(46)

lafbc,a = la

,bfca  la

,cfba .

in this case the killing vectors are

rx1

(x1)2 + (x2)2  ,

l1 = x23  x32 +
l2 = x31  x13 +
l3 = x12  x21 , l =  .

rx2

(x1)2 + (x2)2  ,

(47)

rotational invariance then implies

fm = xmf (r) , f12 = x3g(r) , f23 = x1h(r, x3) , f31 = x2h(r, x3) , (48)
where h(r, x3) = g(r)  rf (r)/(r2  (x3)2). the bianchi identity becomes

f + rf  = 3rg + r2g

and the (1, 1) conditions reduce to

integrating the bianchi identity gives

g = f /2m .

f =

a

r(r + 2m)2

with a an integration constant. the gauge eld is then

a =

az

2m(r + 2m)

,

a = 

a

r + 2m

+ b .

upon reduction, the bosonic action is the same as in eq. 42 with

c1 =

b
2m

,

c2 =

2mb  a

2m

.

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

taking the limit m  0 with c1 and c2 xed gives the earlier models. in
the bosonic action the three parameters (m, a, b) collapse into two, (c1, c2).
however, the third parameter appears in the supersymmetry transformation,

12

eq. 27, since this depends on the complex structure and therefore on m sep-
arately. the fermionic terms in the action are therefore also aected. the
general lagrangian can be written

where c is a torsion form.8,10 the torsion form here is

c = (cid:18)h (r) +

2m

r2 (cid:19) sin d  d  d

(54)

(55)

(see the appendix to ref. 12 or eq. 4.14 of ref. 8). thus the fermionic terms
depend separately on m, through gab and cabc. for the taub-nut metric the
torsion vanishes, as it must.
