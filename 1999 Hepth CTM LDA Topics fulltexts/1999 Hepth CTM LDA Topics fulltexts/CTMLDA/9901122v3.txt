d-branes in an ads3 background

sonia stanciu

abstract. we study the possible d-brane congurations in an
ads3  s3  t 4 background with a ns-ns b eld. we use its
wzw model description and the boundary state formalism, and
we analyse the bosonic and the n =1 supersymmetric cases sep-
arately. we also discuss the corresponding classical open string
sigma model. we determine the spacetime supersymmetry pre-
served by the supersymmetric d-brane congurations.

1. introduction

in the framework of the ads/sym correspondence conjectured by
maldacena in [1], important particles and vacuum congurations (in-
cluding interaction vertices) in the gauge theory are described, on the
string theory side, by d-brane congurations (wrapped or not) in the
corresponding type iib background. thus in [2] witten showed how
various d-brane congurations in the ads5 s5 and ads5
grounds are associated with the baryon vertex and the pfaan particle,
respectively, in the four-dimensional gauge theory at the boundary of
ads5. later, in [3, 4], such d-brane congurations were obtained as
classical solutions of the born-infeld action.

rp 5 back-

although the general belief seems to be that the ads/sym connec-
tion only makes sense in the higgs branch of the sym theory, a proposal
was made [5] to identify certain vacuum congurations of the large n
limit of the n=4 su(n) sym corresponding to the coulomb branch
with particular d3-brane congurations in the bulk of the ads5  s5,
whereby the d3-branes have worldvolumes parallel to the ads bound-
ary. this suggestion was further pursued in [6] where, by using a low
energy analysis, more general d3-brane congurations were analysed
in the ads bulk, and the corresponding amount of supersymmetry pre-
served by these d-brane congurations was determined.

in the face of these facts it appears desirable to carry out a micro-
scopic scft analysis of the possible d-brane congurations in various
ads-type backgrounds. such an analysis however would rely essen-
tially on the explicit knowledge of the cft underlying these string
backgrounds. unfortunately, despite the progress made in construct-
ing type iib string theories with rr background elds on ads spaces

[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] (in the framework of the green-schwarz formalism),
we are still lacking a satisfactory worldsheet description for most of
these backgrounds. the only tractable case so far remains that of type
iib string theory on ads3k, where k is a compact manifold, and we
allow only a ns-ns b eld. these backgrounds have received a great
deal of attention recently, in the cases where k is s3  t 4 [13, 14], or
s3s3s1 [15], and have been studied in detail by using perturbative
methods.
here we will initiate a study of the possible d-branes which can be

formulated consistently in a superstring background dened on

ads3  s3  t 4 .

we will restrict ourselves to the case with a purely ns-ns b eld. this
will allow us to use the known superconformal theory (scft) under-
lying this background, in order to apply the boundary state formalism
[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23].

the paper is organised as follows. in section 2 we will start with
a short summary describing the bosonic background, in order to set
the notation and exhibit the conformal structure. in section 3 we dis-
cuss the boundary state formalism adapted to this particular model.
we consider two classes of gluing conditions: they both satisfy the ba-
sic requirement of conformal invariance, but are distinguished by the
amount of the bulk symmetry they preserve.
in section 4 we anal-
yse the geometry of the resulting d-brane congurations. we consider
the boundary conditions that each of the two classes of gluing condi-
tions give rise to, and determine the types of d-branes they describe.
the congurations described by gluing conditions which preserve the
innite-dimensional symmetry underlying the wzw model generically
describe conjugacy classes translated by elements of the group. this
result agrees in part with the similar analysis in [23]. the other type
of gluing conditions gives rise to more complicated d-brane cong-
urations which include open submanifolds of dimension equal to the
dimension of the target manifold, subgroups and cosets; although a
direct comparison appears to be rather dicult, the two classes of d-
brane congurations obtained here bear a certain similarity to the ones
obtained in [24] by analysing the open string wzw model.

in section 5 we briey discuss the classical boundary conditions pro-
duced by the corresponding open string sigma model in order to inves-
tigate the possibility of having d-branes whose worldvolume lls the
entire target space. we nd that this depends crucially on whether the
corresponding group is compact or not.

in section 6 we extend our analysis to the supersymmetric case, and
determine which d-brane congurations admit an n=1 supersymmet-
ric generalisation.
in section 7 we discuss the fraction of spacetime
supersymmetry preserved by these congurations. we end with a brief

the choice of equal levels forbg1 andbg2 was motivated by the fact that,

in this case, the corresponding n=1 supersymmetric background is a
critical superstring theory, as we will see in section 6.

3. boundary states

the boundary state formalism (see, e.g., [25, 26, 27, 28]) has become
in the last years one of the main approaches to the study of d-branes
in type ii string backgrounds [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. using an explicit
knowledge of the cft underlying a given string background, one de-
scribes a d-brane conguration through a set of boundary conditions,
relating the left and the right moving conformal structures in such a
way that conformal invariance is preserved. in the case of a background
described by a wzw model the elds in terms of which the conformal
structure of the model is realised are the ane currents. it is there-
fore convenient to impose the boundary conditions on these currents in
order to have under control the conformal invariance of the resulting
congurations.

in what follows we will consider two dierent classes of gluing2 con-
ditions which give rise to dierent congurations of d-branes. both of
them will be dened in terms of a lie algebra automorphism, r : g  g,
which preserves the metric ; in other words we have

[r(za), r(zb)] = r([za, zb]) ,

(6)

rt r =  ,

(7)
where {za} is a given basis in g, in terms of which r is given by
r(za) = zbrb
a. we can now dene the two classes of gluing conditions3
as being the following:

(i) type-n gluing conditions, which can be thought of as a generali-

sation of the neumann conditions, are given by

ja(z) + rb

a jb(z) = 0 ,

(8)

2in order to avoid confusion between the boundary conditions satised by the
chiral currents, j and j, and the ones satised the eld g or its components, we
will refer to the boundary conditions on the chiral currents as gluing conditions,
reserving the term of boundary conditions to the elds themselves.

3we will be working here in the open string picture.

at the boundary of the worldsheet. notice that these gluing con-
ditions do not preserve the innitedimensional ane symmetry
of the current algebra (correcting a statemnet made in [22]);

(ii) type-d gluing conditions, which can be thought of as a generali-

sation of dirichlet conditions, read

ja(z)  rb

a jb(z) = 0 .

(9)

by contrast, this type of gluing conditions does preserve the cur-
rent algebra of the bulk theory.

these gluing conditions have to satisfy the basic consistency require-
ment, which is conformal invariance. this means that the holomorphic
and the antiholomorphic sectors are related by an automorphism of
the corresponding cft. in the bosonic case, since the automorphism
group of the virasoro algebra is trivial, we impose

t(z) = t(z) ,

for either of the two types of gluing conditions.

lie algebras g1 = sl(2,r) and g2 = su(2). because these lie algebras
are dierent real forms of the same complex lie algebra sl(2,c), there
deduce that r1 and r2 must separately preserve the metric on sl(2,r)

whereas r2 is an element of o(3).

explicitly, each of these two automorphism conditions translates into
a condition on the corresponding matrix, that is

which makes r1 belong to so(2, 1), and r2 to so(3).

these results can be summarised as follows. we have identied two

which preserve conformal invariance. each of them is described in

det(r1) = det(r2) = 1 ,

7

the type-d gluing conditions (9) preserve also the innite-dimensional
symmetry of the current algebra of the bulk theory. in what follows
we will analyse in detail both these types of congurations in order to
identify the d-branes they describe.

4. d-brane solutions and geometry

the geometric interpretation of the gluing conditions dened on the
chiral currents of the wzw theory in terms of d-brane congurations is
arguably the most subtle issue of this approach. the precise statement
of the problem is the following: given a set of gluing conditions for the
chiral currents and a xed but otherwise arbitrary point g in the target
group manifold, nd the possible d-branes which pass through g and
are described by these gluing conditions.

the diculty lies with the fact that the gluing conditions imposed on
the ane currents, despite being a natural nonabelian generalisation
of the boundary conditions in a free theory are not, strictly speaking,
boundary conditions. the at space boundary conditions are dened in
the tangent space of the target manifold and therefore the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of the corresponding matrix r identify the neumann
and dirichlet directions. in the group manifold case the gluing con-
ditions take values in the tangent space of g at the identity, that is
teg  g, because the currents themselves are lie algebra valued ob-
jects. hence, in order to interpret geometrically the algebraic gluing
conditions we must rst of all translate them into boundary condi-
tions in tgg, and then determine what the neumann and dirichlet
directions are in this case.

of so(2, 1) can be thought of as a lorentz transformation inr2,1. in

in case of the ads3  s3 background, the matrix r has a block
diagonal form (11), which allows us to analyse the d-brane congu-
rations on ads3 and s3 separately. thus r1, which is an element

three dimensions, any lorentz transformation leaves a vector invariant.
depending on the causal type of this vector, we can distinguish three
types of lorentz transformations:

(i) spatial rotations, typically of the form

r .

in this case r1 has generically one +1 eigenvalue, with the corre-

in this case r1 has generically a +1 eigenvalue whose eigenvector
is light-like.
in contrast with the other two cases, a null rota-
tion is not diagonalisable over the complex numbers. this makes
the geometric interpretation of the corresponding conguration
relatively dicult.

by contrast, a d-brane conguration in su(2) is described by an

it is generically characterised by a +1 eigenvalue, whose eigenvector
corresponds to the direction which is left invariant by the rotation.

type-n congurations. we now arrive at the basic fact on which
our geometric interpretation of the gluing conditions is based. here
we will only state this result (details will appear elsewhere [29]) and
proceed to apply it to the case of the group manifold corresponding to
ads3  s3.
let us parametrise the group manifold g by introducing the co-
ordinates x , with  = 1, ..., dim g; we also introduce the left- and
right-invariant vielbeins, e and e, dened by

g1dg = ea

 dx za ,

dgg1 = ea

 dx za .

the gluing conditions (8) will then give rise to the following boundary
conditions at a generic point g in g:

x  = r(g)

x  ,



where the matrix of boundary conditions r(g) is given by

r(g) = e1re .

notice that r(g), which describes the boundary conditions at a given
point in the target space, depends on that point through the invariant
vielbeins. one can now identify the neumann and dirichlet directions
by analogy with the at space case. at a given point, a dirichlet
boundary condition corresponds to a 1 eigenvalue of the matrix r(g),
which means that the directions normal to the worldvolume of the
d-brane are spanned by the corresponding eigenvectors of r(g). all
the other eigenvalues describe neumann boundary conditions (in the

presence of a b eld) and the corresponding eigenvectors span the
tangent space of the worldvolume of the d-brane.

we now start with sl(2,r), and consider the simplest possible case
where r1 =1. in this case the boundary conditions at a point g1()
at the identity we obtain r1(e) =1, which indicates that we have three
neumann directions spanning the whole sl(2,r). in other words, the
identity in sl(2,r) belongs to a d2-brane.
if we now move away from the identity, r1 will no longer be1. in-
will be a submanifold of sl(2,r) where r1(g1) will have at least one
generate the adjoint action of the group sl(2,r)

1 eigenvalue (two, in fact, since det r1 = 1).
in other words, at
each point on this particular submanifold we will have one neumann
and two dirichlet directions. this submanifold can be described as
the zero locus f1 of a function, f1(g1)  tr r1(g1) + 1, which in our
parametrisation is given by

stead, we obtain that r1 always has one +1 eigenvalue and two complex
conjugate eigenvalues. hence, at generic points in the group manifold,
r1(g1) will still give rise to three neumann directions; however there

one can show that f1 is a class function; that is, f1(h1gh) = f1(g)
for all group elements g, h. indeed, if we consider the vector elds that

f1 = 1 + cosh 1 cosh 2 + cosh 2 cos 3 + cos 3 cosh 1

we can check that f1 is annihilated by them, that is

a = 1, 2, 3,

(16)

ha(g1)  f1(g1) = 0 ,

for all a = 1, 2, 3. hence we have that f1 consists of adjoint orbits
that is, conjugacy classes.

at every point in f1 we have one neumann and two dirichlet bound-
ary conditions. the vector eld corresponding to the neumann direc-
tion therefore spans the worldline of a d-particle.
in order for this
picture to be consistent we must verify that the worldlines of these
d0-branes lie within f1. indeed, a straightforward calculation shows
that we have

algebra, and therefore r1 is an inner automorphism; hence it can be
identied with adr1, for some group element r1. as we will see in
the next paragraph, the eect of an inner automorphism at the level
of the gluing conditions is a translation in the group manifold. more
precisely, the submanifold on which r1 = e1
1 has 1 eigenvalues,
which we denote by f(r1)
which
satises f (r1)(g) = f (gr1
is nothing but the translation
of the previous f1 by the group element r1, that is f(r1)
1 = f1r1. hence
through every point in f1r1 passes a d0-brane whose worldline lies on
f1r1. moreover, the neumann eigenvectors tangent to the worldline of
the d0-branes in f1r1 can be obtained by translating accordingly the
corresponding neumann eigenvectors tangent to the d0-branes in f1.
a particularly interesting case is the one where r1 itself has two 1
eigenvalues (this can be obtained by taking r1 of the form (12) with
 = ). in this case, the corresponding surface f1r1 passes through

the identity element in sl(2,r), and therefore there exists a particu-
the subgroup of sl(2,r) generated by x3. moreover, the translation
worldlines are cosets in sl(2,r).
with r2 =1, the boundary conditions at a point g2(i) will read
2 e2. at the identity we have r2(e) =1, which

vector takes a particularly simple form at the identity, being given by
v1 = 3, as expected. the worldline of this d0-brane is nothing but

of this particular solution gives rise to d0-brane congurations whose

we can now analyse the su(2) case in a similar fashion. if we start

where r2(g2) = e1
gives three neumann directions spanning su(2). we can therefore con-
clude that the identity in su(2) belongs to an euclidean d2-brane.
away from the identity, r2 will have one +1 and two complex conju-
gate eigenvalues, which generically describe three neumann directions.
similarly to the previous case, there will be a submanifold f2 of su(2)
where r2 has two 1 eigenvalues. this submanifold can be described
as the zero locus of the function f2(g2)  tr r2(g2) + 1 which reads
f2 = 1 + cos 1 cos 2 + cos 2 cos 3 + cos 3 cos 1

as before, one can show that f2 is a class function, and hence that f2
consists of conjugacy classes.

finally, if instead of r2 =1 we take r2 = adr2 (since, as before, r2

one can show, along the same lines, that f2 is foliated by the world-
lines of the euclidean d0-branes whose tangent vectors are given by the

whose worldlines lie in f2r2.

type-d congurations. this type of gluing gluing conditions (9)
have been recently analysed in [23], where the resulting d-brane con-
gurations have been identied with conjugacy classes. here however,
by using a slightly dierent point of view, we will arrive at partially
dierent conclusions.

as we mentioned before, the reason for which the gluing conditions
(9) cannot immediately be interpreted as boundary conditions in the
target space is the fact that the currents themselves are lie algebra
valued objects. in order to obtain a boundary condition from the gluing
condition (9), we must translate the currents, which take values in g,
into objects taking values in tgg. in this way one obtains [29]

g = r(g) g ,

(17)

with the matrix of boundary conditions given by
r(g) = (g)  r  (g)1



,

where g and g stand for left- and right-multiplication by g in g.
the condition (17) now takes place in tgg, and it is the correspond-
ing, point-dependent matrix r(g) which determines the neumann and
dirichlet directions. indeed, at a given point g in g, a dirichlet bound-
ary condition corresponds to a 1 eigenvalue of r(g), which means that
the directions normal to the worldvolume of the d-brane are spanned
by the corresponding eigenvectors of r(g). all the other eigenvalues
describe neumann boundary conditions and the corresponding eigen-
vectors span the tangent space of the worldvolume of the d-brane.

if r is taken to be the identity matrix, then r(g) =  adg1, and the
corresponding d-branes can be identied with the conjugacy classes of
the group g [23]. indeed, in this case, and provided that the metric
g restricts nondegenerately to the conjugacy class c of g, the tangent
space at g splits into the tangent space to the conjugacy class and its
perpendicular complement, which can be identied with the tangent
space to the centraliser subgroup z of g:

both sl(2,r) and su(2) are simple lie algebras, we can restrict ourselves

moreover adg1 restricts to the identity on tgz, which means that the
dirichlet directions span tgz. furthermore, the neumann directions
span tgc, and hence the worldvolume of the d-brane can be identied
with c.

tgg = tgc  tgz with tgc  tgz .

let us now consider the case of an arbitrary r. in our case, since

to the case where r is an inner automorphism, and hence can be iden-
tied with adr, for some group element r. therefore the corresponding

12

g =  adg1 g ,

boundary conditions can be written in the following form

ground, they are not necessarily symmetries the theory containing a
d-brane. this fact is not surprising, as d-branes break some of the
bulk symmetries even in at space (e.g., translational symmetry).

with g = gr1. this implies that the corresponding d-brane lies along
the righttranslate cr of the conjugacy class of g by the element r.
this result contradicts the statement made in [23] according to which
inner automorphisms, being a symmetry of the model cannot result
in d-brane congurations dierent from the the ones already described

by r =1. although inner automorphisms are symmetries of the back-

gluing conditions give rise to d5-, d3-, and d1-branes in ads3  s3

or onedimensional submanifolds of ads3 and s3, respectively. more-
over, particular solutions for n1 and n2 include subgroups and cosets

tions, for a given r = adr, describe d-branes whose worldvolumes
are shifted conjugacy classes of the form cr1  cr2, which can be 0-,
2- or 4-dimensional.

5. relation to the sigma model approach

one of the most surprising results of the boundary state analysis of
the possible d-branes in ads3  s3 is the absence of d-brane cong-
urations which ll the entire group manifold. in this section we pause
for a moment our analysis via the boundary state approach to consider
the classical sigma model which corresponds to our wzw theory. our
main aim here is to investigate the possibility of having d-branes which
ll the whole target space, that is ads3  s3.
the action of a generic wzw model on a 2-space with a disc topology
with an additional interaction (1-form eld a) at the boundary reads

s =zhg1g, g1 gi +z

gb +z

ga .

(18)

here the worldsheet  is a two-dimensional manifold with boundary
, and b represents a particular choice for the antisymmetric ten-
sor eld. a d-brane conguration is characterised in this setting (for
more details see [24]) by a two-form  living on the worldvolume d
of the d-brane (in which the boundary of the string worldsheet  is
included), and satisfying d = db|d. since d(b  )|d = 0, one can
dene locally the one-form potential a such that da = b  . s may

14

spaces, corresponding to the two groups, sl(2,r) and su(2), respec-

be viewed as a special case of an action for an open string propagating
on a group manifold and coupled to a at the boundary. in the case
of ads3  s3 the action consists of two independent terms, s1 + s2,
such that each of them is of the form (18), only with dierent target

tively. however for the most part we will work with the generic form
of the action (18), and we will consider the two components separately
only at the very end.

the innitesimal variation of s contains a bulk term (yielding the
same equations of motion as in the closed string case) and a boundary
term which reads

z

where  is the generic metric on the group manifold and x  are the
coordinates introduced in the previous section. we have denoted by p
the component of the 2-momentum normal to the boundary  which
is given by

p = gx  i x ,

having neumann boundary conditions in all directions amounts to
imposing p| = 0, for all . in order to compare these conditions
with the boundary conditions (8), we must express them in terms of
the same quantitiesthat is, in terms of the conserved currents. for
this we use the expressions of the currents in terms of the spacetime
elds

then the neumann boundary conditions take the following form

where the matrix m depends on the background elds, being given by

since we imposed neumann conditions in all directions, it is natural
to expect that we obtain a d-brane whose worldvolume has the same
dimension as the dimension of the target space. notice however that
from this we cannot immediately deduce that the d-brane worldvolume

literally lls the whole target space. we will return to this point at the
end of this section.

in our case, since all the relevant quantities (that is, the background
elds and the corresponding vielbeins) take a block-diagonal form with
respect to the two group components, the matrix m will do so as well,

5.1. the sl(2,r) component. we can now compute the matrix of
with target space sl(2,r). in order to do this we use the parametrisa-
tion of sl(2,r) given by the rst expression in (2). then the invariant

boundary conditions m1 corresponding to the open wzw action s1

therefore we can compute the two components separately.

alternatively, one can write m1 in a more succinct form by using
the adjoint action of the group, in terms of which we have m1 =
ad(e2x2e1x1e3x3). one can therefore see that m1 is indeed an el-
ement of so(2, 1), as we obtained in section 3, where the parameters
are given by the elds themselves.

5.2. the su(2) component. we now turn to s2, whose matrix of
boundary conditions we denote by m2. we use the parametrisation of

sponding invariant vielbeins e2 and e2 which read

from this we obtain the corresponding background metric, (g2) =

also here we can use the adjoint action of the group to write m2 =
ad(e2y2e1y1e3y3). in this case the matrix describing the boundary
conditions is an element of so(3), as obtained in section 3, and again
the parameters are given by the elds themselves.

by putting m1 and m2 together we obtain the matrix of classical
boundary conditions for the open string sigma model on ads3  s3.
it is important to remark that the classical boundary conditions we
obtained in this way are described by a eld-dependent automorphism
of the corresponding lie algebra, which preserves the metric. thus, on
the one hand, these congurations do preserve conformal invariance.
on the other hand, they give rise to gluing conditions which have a
similar form with the type-n gluing conditions introduced in section 3,
the only dierence being that, here, they are eld-dependent.

we now nally come to the main point of this section, which is
to investigate the possibility of having d-branes in ads3  s3 which
ll the whole target space. in order to see this, we must analyse the
eigenvalues of the matrix of boundary conditions. we therefore need to
rewrite the neumann boundary conditions (20) in a slightly dierent
form:

where the eld-dependent matrix m is given by

x  = m 

 x  ,

m =

g + 
g  

.

clearly, in order to have a consistent conguration, m should not pos-
sess 1 eigenvalues, which would correspond to dirichlet directions.

that, in spite of our similar treatment of the two groups sl(2,r) and
is a compact group, whereas sl(2,r) is noncompact. consequently

an explicit calculation shows that m1 possesses no 1 eigenvalues,
whereas m2 does possess 1 eigenvalues, but only at the points where
our parametrisation of su(2) is singular, that is when cos 1 = 0.
in order to explain these dierent results, we must take into account

su(2), there is however one important distinction between them: su(2)

17

the su(2) part of our sigma model analysis involves some subtleties,
for instance our parametrisation of su(2) in (2) becomes singular for
cos 1 = 0, and the two-form b cannot be not globally dened. this
indicates that, even if we impose neumann boundary conditions in all
directions the corresponding d-brane will not ll the whole s3, but
rather a three-dimensional submanifold of s3.

union of two circles inside s3, since

in fact, one can show that these singular points make up a disjoint

and hence the corresponding d3-brane in s3 is given by the complement
of the above circles in s3. although a direct comparison is not easy,
this agrees at least morally with [24]. hence we must conclude that
one can construct d-brane congurations which ll the whole group

this scft has a central charge c = 15. notice that although so far
we have only considered the holomorphic sector, we have a similar
structure for the antiholomorphic sector as well. in other words, we
have a (1, 1) scft.

as in the bosonic case, we consider two classes of gluing conditions.

the gluing conditions of type-n are given by

ja(z) + rb

a jb(z) = 0 ,

a(z) + sb

a

b(z) = 0 ,

(30)

whereas the gluing conditions of type-d read

ja(z)  rb

a jb(z) = 0 ,

a(z)  sb

a b(z) = 0 .

(31)

a and sb

a and s(za) = zbsb

in both cases the coecients rb
a are dened by r, s : g  g,
with r(za) = zbrb
a, for any za in g. these
conditions are to be understood as supersymmetric generalisations of
the gluing itions written down in section 3; therefore, r is taken to be
an automorphism of g which preserves the metric. moreover, since we
want to obtain supersymmetric congurations, the gluing conditions
satised by the fermions will undoubtedly be related to the ones of the
bosons; however we do not impose here any specic conditions on s.

these gluing conditions have to satisfy a similar consistency require-
ment as in the bosonic case. in this context, consistency means that
the holomorphic scft is set equal to the antiholomorphic scft up

to an automorphism of the n=1 sca; in other words, at the boundary
we must have

19

t(z) = t(z)

and

g(z) = g(z) .

these boundary conditions have been written down previously in [19],
in the context of kazamasuzuki models.

the rst requirement translates into a number of conditions on the
matrices r and s. let us start with the type-d boundary conditions.
from the quadratic terms in the currents we obtain that

rt r =  ,

which immediately implies that

st r =  ,

s = r ,

(32)

as one would expect from supersymmetry. further, from the cubic
terms in the currents we have that
[s(za), s(zb)] = s([za, zb]) ,

[r(za), s(zb)] = s([za, zb]) ,

which, together with (32), implies that

[r(za), r(zb)] = r([za, zb]) .

(33)

in other words, the conditions that r must satisfy in order for the corre-
sponding type-d congurations to preserve superconformal invariance
match exactly the assumptions already made on r. furthermore, it
follows that these gluing conditions preserve the innite-dimensional
symmetry of the n=1 current algebra (22)-(27).

if we turn now to the type-n gluing conditions, we obtain once again
that s = r, from the quadratic terms of t and g. however, from
the cubic terms we obtain
[s(za), s(zb)] = s([za, zb]) ,

[r(za), s(zb)] = s([za, zb]) ,

which, together with (32), implies that

[r(za), r(zb)] = r([za, zb]) .

(34)

this implies that r must be an anti-automorphism, contrary to our
ansatz. from this we deduce that the type-n gluing conditions do not
preserve the n=1 superconformal invariance of the background. for
this reason, in the remaining of this paper, we will concentrate on the
type-d congurations.

from the bosonic case we know that r takes a block-diagonal form
(11); therefore the condition (32) implies hat s must have a similar
form

s = (cid:18)r1

0 r2(cid:19) .

0

(35)

20

this shows that every bosonic type-d congurations that we deter-
mined previously can be made into an n=1 supersymmetric congu-
ration without having to impose additional conditions.

7. spacetime supersymmetry

one of the most important properties of d-brane congurations is
that they preserve some of the spacetime supersymmetry of the back-
ground in which they live, which translates into the fact that they sat-
isfy the bps condition. in the context of superconformal eld theories
spacetime supersymmetry appears as a by-product of n=2 supercon-
formal invariance, being related, via bosonisation, to the u(1) current.
instead of following this standard approach, here we will analyse the
spacetime symmetry preserved by the d-branes we found using a dif-
ferent route, which was described in [13].

we will therefore consider the spacetime supercharges to be con-
structed directly from the n=1 scft, by choosing ve fermion bilin-
ears and bosonising them into ve scalar elds hi, with i = 1, . . . , 5
as follows

h1 =

1
k

(12) ,

h2 =

1
k

(12) ,

ih3 =

1
k

(33) ,

h4 = (12) ,

h5 = (34) .

the corresponding spacetime supercharges will then read [30]

q =i dze 

2 s(z) ,

(36)

where  is the scalar eld which appears in the bosonised superghost
system of the fermionic string, and

i

2pi i hi ,

s(z) = e

(37)
is a linear combination of the spin elds, where the coecients i = 1
label the possible supercharges, subject to a number of requirements
(for a detailed discussion see [13]). thus, due to the requirement of mu-
tual locality between the various supercharges, and of brst invariance
these coecients must satisfy the following conditions:

123 = 1 ,

45 = 1 .

this yields eight supercharges for each of the holomorphic and antiholo-
morphic sectors of the superstring background, which are displayed in
table 3.

given a certain d-brane conguration, we can use the gluing condi-
tions of the fermionic elds in order to derive the boundary conditions
satisfyed by the supercharges, and determine, in this way, the fraction
of spacetime supersymmetry preserved by that particular boundary

state. to illustrate, let us consider the case of the congurations de-
scribed by a matrix r, with r1 of the form (12). the corresponding
conditions satised by the fermions read

1  cos  1  sin  2 = 0 ,
2 + sin  1  cos  2 = 0 ,
3  3 = 0 ,

1  cos  1  sin  2 = 0 ,
2 + sin  1  cos  2 = 0 ,
3  3 = 0 ,

where we have systematically ignored a  sign coming from (35), which
does not aect the fermion bilinears in the expression of s(z). there-
fore we deduce that hi = hi, for i = 1, 2, 3. since we are considering
d-branes embedded in ads3s3, the boundary conditions correspond-
ing to the fermions on the torus are always the same (that is, dirichlet),
and will therefore give hi = hi, for i = 4, 5. from this it follows that

q = q ,

 = 1, . . . , 8

(38)

this means that all the corresponding d-brane congurations discussed
in section 4 preserve half of the spacetime supersymmetry of the back-
ground.

in order to analyse the spacetime supersymmetry properties of the
d-brane congurations described by matrices r with r1 of the form
(13), we need to adopt a slightly dierent choice for the ve fermion
bilinears and, thus, for the corresponding scalar elds hi:

ih1 =

1
k

(13) ,

h2 =

1
k

(12) ,

h3 =

1
k

(23) ,

h4 = (12) ,

h5 = (34) .

similarly, we obtain that for the corresponding d-brane congurations
the supercharges satisfy the same conditions (38). due to the non-
local nature of the dependence of the spacetime supercharges on the
fermionic elds and to the particular form of the boundary conditions
satised by the elds in the third case of the discussion in section 4
(that is, where r1 is of the form (14)), it is rather dicult to deter-
mine the fraction of spacetime supersymmetry preserved this type of
congurations.

22

to summarise, we have obtained that all the d-brane congurations
which preserve the superconformal invariance of te background and
have a geometrical description give rise to bps states preserving half
of the spacetime supersymmetry.

let us conclude this section with a remark. every boundary state
that we identied and which gives rise to a dp-brane in ads3  s3
(as shown in table 2), can also describe (with appropriate boundary
conditions in the at directions) d(p+2)- and d(p+4)-branes wrapped
on t 2 and t 4, respectively.

8. discussion

in this paper we have studied, using the scft framework and the
boundary state formalism, the possible d-brane congurations which
can be consistently dened in an ads3  s3 background characterised
by a purely ns-ns b eld. we have seen that at the bosonic level one
can dene two classes of gluing conditions which preserve conformal
invariance, which we called typen and typed conditions. type
d gluing conditions have the additional property that they preserve
the innite-dimensional symmetry of the bulk theory generated by the
chiral currents.

in order to determine the geometry of the corresponding d-brane
congurations we had to rst obtain the boundary conditions encoded
in the algebraic gluing conditions. then, by analysing these boundary
conditions, we were able to show that typed gluing conditions describe
d-branes whose worldvolume is given by shifted conjugacy classes in
the group manifold. furthermore, this type of congurations admits
an n=1 supersymmetric generalisation which preserves not only the
superconformal invariance of the corresponding background, but also
the underlying n=1 ane superalgebra of the bosonic and fermionic
currents. by contrast, typen gluing conditions do not preserve the
current algebra of the bulk theory. they describe d-brane congura-
tions which are slightly more dicult to characterise geometrically, in
the most general case. we have however seen that we obtain in partic-
ular d-branes whose worldvolume is an open submanifold of dimension
equal to the dimension of the target manifold, and also some subgroups
and cosets. this type of d-brane congurations does not seem to gen-
eralise to the supersymmetric case, in the sense that it does not yield
superconformal congurations.

the two classes of bosonic d-brane congurations found here bear a
certain degree of similarity with the d-brane congurations obtained in
[24] using a open string wzw model analysis. there it was moreover
shown that the two distinct classes of d-brane congurations are related
by poissonlie tduality. it would be interesting to invest igate this
possible relashionship also in our setting.

ties we have been able to analyse have in common the fact that the
complex structure (implicitly dened through the choice of fermion bi-
linears) on the ten-dimensional background gives rise, when restricted
to the tangent space of the worldvolume of a given d-brane, to a com-
plex structure on the corresponding submanifold of the target. in other
words, these d-brane congurations correspond to pseudocomplex cy-

ative to some basis. conjugation by gl(2,r) will then correspond
to a change of basis inr2. the gl(2,r)-orbits in sl(2,r) will then

choices of s which are complex.)

this matrix is itself conjugate under gl(2,c) to the real matrix

under gl(2,c) and by the previous argument, the conjugation can
actually be taken to be in gl(2,r).
in summary, the gl(2,r) orbits of sl(2,r) are labelled by the fol-
in order to recover the sl(2,r) conjugacy classes from these gl(2,r)
orbits it is necessary to decompose every gl(2,r) orbit into sl(2,r)
orbits. let m be a matrix in sl(2,r) and let o denote its gl(2,r)

where we can choose  in [0, ] and  real with 0 < ||  1. these
choices correspond to the choice in ordering the eigenvalues of the (di-
agonalisable) normal forms.

to those elements with positive and negative determinant. correspond-
ingly o breaks up into two connected components: o = o+o, where

the lie group gl(2,r) has two connected components corresponding
o :=(cid:8)gmg1 | g  gl(2,r) and  det g > 0(cid:9) .
now every matrix g  gl(2,r) with det g > 0 can be written as
where the matrix s has unit determinant and hence belongs to sl(2,r).
we see that o+ is precisely the sl(2,r)-orbit of m.
on the other hand, let g  gl(2,r) with deg g < 0. then we can

g =pdet g s where

since for such a matrix g,

and where s is now given by

p| det g|

and has unit determinant again. now for such a g, we have that

whence o is the sl(2,r)-orbit of the matrix tmt1 which belongs to
sl(2,r).
in summary we see that the gl(2,r)-orbit of a matrix m  sl(2,r)
breaks up in at most two sl(2,r) orbits: that of m and that of tmt1.
it might happen that m and tmt1 are actually in the same sl(2,r)
simple matter to enumerate the conjugacy classes of sl(2,r) from the
enumeration of the gl(2,r) orbits in (39). every matrix in sl(2,r)
is conjugate in sl(2,r) to one of the following matrices:
e in the centre of sl(2,r). the remaining conjugacy classes are

where to avoid repetition we must now take  real with 0 < || < 1
and   [0, 2).
the results are summarised in table 4. there are two conjugacy
classes ce consisting of a point each, corresponding to the elements

table 4. sl(2,r) conjugacy classes, with typical ele-
understand the geometry of these conjugacy classes in sl(2,r). to this
end we let us reconsider the embedding of sl(2,r) as a hyperboloid in
mat(2,r) =r4, this time using a dierent coordinate system forr4:
sl(2,r) =(cid:26)(cid:18)x + u y + v
group of sl(2,r) manifestly. the isometries are nothing but the prod-
y  v x  u(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) x2 + y2 = 1 + u2 + v2(cid:27) .

a.2. the geometry of the conjugacy classes. it is possible to

this embedding has the virtue of exhibiting the so(2, 2) isometry

uct of left and right transformations (modulo the centre which acts
trivially):

sl(2,r)  sl(2,r)
z2

.

so(2, 2) =

for our present purpose, a more interesting property of this embedding
is that the coordinate x equals half the trace, which is an invariant of

27

the conjugacy class. therefore the conjugacy classes will be contained
in the intersection of the three-dimensional hyperboloid

h3 :

x2 + y2 = 1 + u2 + v2

(41)

with the ane hyperplanes x = constant. we can distinguish several
regions of interest: |x| < 1, |x| = 1, and |x| > 1. we will now analyse
each of them in turn. the results are illustrated in figure 1.

figure 1. the dierent types of conjugacy classes of sl(2,r).

(b) |x| = 1

(a) |x| < 1

(c) |x| > 1

we start with the regions |x| > 1. the intersection of the ane
hyperplane x = constant with h3 is given by (x2  1) + y2 = u2 + v2
which is a two-dimensional one-sheeted hyperboloid. it is connected
and hence it is a conjugacy class: the class c, where x =  + 1/.

the intersection of h3 with the ane hyperplane x = 1 is the light-
cone y2 = u2 + v2. this breaks up into three conjugacy classes: the
apex of the cone, which consists of the class ce, the upper light-cone
y > 0 with the apex removed, which is the class c+ and the lower
light-cone y < 0 with the apex removed, which is the class c.

finally, for |x| < 1, the intersection of h3 with the ane hyperplane
x = constant is the two-dimensional two-sheeted hyperboloid y2 =
u2 + v2 + (1 x2). each sheet is one conjugacy class. if we let x = cos 
then the upper sheet is the class c when   (0, ) and the lower sheet
is the class c when   (, 0).
as a concluding comment, let us remark that the method presented
here can be employed with a little extra eort to enumerate the conju-

gacy classes of sl(n,r).

a.3. the causal structure of the conjugacy classes. due to their
possible interpretation as d-branes, it is important to establish the

28

by the intersection of ane hyperplanes inr4 with the hyperboloid h3
in (41) dening the embedding of sl(2,r) inr4. as was mentioned
above, this embedding is isometric provided we endowr4 with a split

causal structure of the conjugacy classes which were found above: only
those classes which are nondegenerate can be straightforwardly inter-
preted as boundary conditions for strings. the determination of the
causal structure is made easy by the fact that these classes are described

metric of signature (2, 2). in the coordinates (x, y, u, v) chosen above,
such a metric is given by

ds2 = du2 + dv2  dx2  dy2 .

(42)

it is then a simple matter to work out the induced metric on the conju-
gacy classes. let us now summarise the results. of course, we only need
concern ourselves with those conjugacy classes which are not pointlike.

a.3.1. c. these conjugacy classes are the deleted halves of the light-
cones at x = 1. they are dened by this equation together with
y2 = u2 + v2. let us parametrise the conjugacy class by (, ) in the
following way:

x = 1

y =  u =  cos  v =  sin  .

the induced metric is then given by

ds2 = 2d2 ,

which is clearly degenerate. this means that the conjugacy classes c
(with signs uncorrelated) cannot be interpreted as d-branes, at least
straightforwardly.

a.3.2. c. these are two-sheeted hyperboloids obtained by intersect-
ing the ane hyperplane dened by constant x with |x| < 1 and the
hyperboloid h3. we parametrise these classes by (, ) in the following
way

y = p2 + (1  x2) u =  cos  v =  sin  .

the induced metric is then given by

ds2 = 2d2 +

d2 ,

(1  x2)

2 + (1  x2)

which is clearly euclidean. therefore the corresponding d-branes are
euclidean d-strings.

a.3.3. c. these are the one-sheeted hyperboloids obtained by inter-
secting the ane hyperplane dened by constant x with |x| > 1 and the
hyperboloid h3. we parametrise these classes by (y, ) in the following
way

u =py2 + (x2  1) cos  v =py2 + (x2  1) sin  .

the induced metric is then given by

ds2 =(cid:0)y2 + (x2  1)(cid:1) d2 

(x2  1)

y2 + (x2  1)

which is clearly minkowskian. therefore the corresponding d-branes
are d-strings.
