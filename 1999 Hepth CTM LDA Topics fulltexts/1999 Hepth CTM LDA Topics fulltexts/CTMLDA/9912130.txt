shown standard projective modules  noncommutative two-torus discretized terms nite-dimensional matrix algebras. immediately raises apparent paradox. standard result asserts noncommutative torus cannot described approximately nite dimensional algebra. means cannot written explicitly large n limit sequence nite dimensional matrix algebras. one way understand terms k-theory. k-theory groups stable
