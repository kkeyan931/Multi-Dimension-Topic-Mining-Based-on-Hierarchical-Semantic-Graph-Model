abstract

we obtain the t-duality transformations of space-time spinors (the supersym-
metry transformation parameters, gravitinos and dilatinos) of type-ii theories
in curved backgrounds with an isometry. the transformation of the spinor
index is shown to be a consequence of the twist that t-duality introduces
between the left and right-moving local lorentz frames. the result is then
used to derive the t-duality action on ramond-ramond eld strengths and
potentials in a simple way. we also discuss the massive iia theory and, using
duality, give a short derivation of mass-dependent terms in the wess-zumino
actions on the d-brane worldvolumes.

1 introduction

the action of a t-duality transformation on the string worldsheet fermions can be studied
by demanding compatibility with the n = 1 worldsheet supersymmetry. this determines
the t-duality transformation of the worldsheet spinors both in at space [1] as well as in
the presence of background elds with an isometry along which duality is performed [2].
the eect on extended worldsheet supersymmetry has been studied in [3, 4] and also in
[2, 5], when the extended supersymmetry does not respect the isometry. in this paper, we
study the action of t-duality on space-time fermions in type-ii superstring theories with
background elds and use the results to give a simple derivation of the r-r t-duality
rules.

in at backgrounds, the action of t-duality on space-time spinors follows in a rather
straightforward way from its action on the worldsheet currents x m and worldsheet
fermions m
 [1, 6, 7]: a t-duality with respect to x 9 sends +x 9  +x 9 and
9
+  9
+, keeping all other variables unchanged. hence, on the left-moving half of the
worldsheet theory, it can be regarded as a parity reection along x 9, while the right-
moving sector remains invariant. the action of such a transformation on the left-moving
ramond ground state is represented by 0 = 119 as this operator sends 9 of the left-
moving sector to 1
+ in
the ramond sector. the action of 0 can now be absorbed in the space-time spinors. for
example, for the parameters of space-time supersymmetry  (where the subscripts 
refer to the worldsheet sectors in which the supersymmetry acts), this leads to +  0+,
while  remains unchanged. one can also obtain the action of t-duality on the gravitinos
m from the invariance of their vertex operators under t-duality. +m contains the
left-moving r ground state and hence transforms as +m  0+m while m contains
a left-moving ns eld m

0 90 = 9, consistent with the fact that 9 is the zero mode of 9

 and hence 9  9, i  i.

in the general case of non-at backgrounds with an isometry, say, along x 9, t-duality
no longer reduces to a parity transformation acting on left-moving (or right-moving)
worldsheet variables alone.
in fact, in general, it acts as a canonical transformation
aecting both left and right moving sectors of the worldsheet theory [8, 9, 2]. furthermore,
in curved backgrounds, the relationship between the worldsheet fermions and space-time
dirac algebra is not as straightforward as in at space. therefore, it does not seem
possible to obtain the t-duality action on space-time fermions, or equivalently, on the
ramond sector, from worldsheet considerations alone.

in this paper, we study the action of t-duality on space-time spinors in type-ii string
theories in the presence of ns-ns and r-r background elds. the spinors we consider
are the space-time supersymmetry transformation parameters , the two gravitinos m 
and the two dilatinos . these results are then used to derive the t-duality rules for the
r-r elds, including the massive iia case. both backgrounds and spinors are assumed

2

to be independent of the coordinate x 9 along which t-duality is performed (with the
exception of type-iib potentials dual to massive type-iia).

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, the transformation of  is obtained by
identifying a t-duality action on the local lorentz frame associated with the left-moving
sector of the worldsheet theory. we also describe a set of variables in terms of which the
curved-space duality resembles the at-space case. in section 3, we consider space-time
supersymmetry transformations in type-ii theories in ns-ns backgrounds and determine
the gravitino and dilatino t-duality transformations. these are shown to be independent
of r-r backgrounds. in section 4, we use these transformations to derive the t-duality
rules for r-r eld strengths and potentials, emphasizing the locality of potentials in the
massive type-iia case. we then use t-duality to give a simple derivation of the mass-
dependent terms in the wess-zumino action for d-branes in massive iia theory. section
5 contains the conclusions. many of the formulas used in this paper are given in the
appendix for convenience and to insure consistency of conventions.

2 representation of t-duality on spinors in curved

backgrounds

in this section we describe how t-duality acts on the spinorial index of space-time fermions
in type-ii theories with background elds (the extension to other string theories is straight-
forward). this fully determines the transformation of the supersymmetry transformation
parameters .

the action of t-duality on massless ns-ns sector elds gm n , bm n and the dilaton  is
well known [12]. for later reference, we write the result here in our t-duality conventions,

99 ,

99 b9i ,
99 g9i ,

eg99 = g1
eg9i = g1
eb9i = g1
egij = gij  g1
ebij = bij  g1
2 e = 2   ln g99 .

99 (g9ig9j  b9ib9j) ,
99 (g9ib9j  b9ig9j) ,

(1)

here, m, n are space-time indices in 10 dimensions. the backgrounds are assumed to be
independent of the x 9 coordinate along which t-duality is performed, but may depend
on the remaining coordinates which we label by x i with i = 0, 1,   , 8. throughout this
paper, a tilde denotes a eld in the t-dual theory.

let us decompose the 10 dimensional metric of type-ii theories in terms of the viel-

beins, gm n = e a

m abeb

n , where a, b are lorentz frame indices. it is known that the t-dual
(+)a, both giving rise

theory contains two possible vielbeins that we denote by eem
to the same t-dual metric egm n [2, 4, 10]. explicitly,

()a and eem

the matrices q that implement t-duality on the vielbeins are given (along with their
inverses) by,

where 19 denotes the identity matrix in nine dimensions. the two vielbeins in the dual
theory are related by a local lorentz transformation a

using the expressions for q, it is easy to see that the matrix  is given by

note that det  = 1.

the appearance of two possible vielbeins in the dual theory is not an inconsequential
ambiguity and disregarding either of them will lead to an inconsistent theory. in fact, it
forces us to augment t-duality with a local lorentz transformation acting only on the
lorentz frame associated with the left-moving sector of the worldsheet theory. to see this,
it is useful to regard the two vielbeins in gm n = e a
n as the wavefunctions associated
with the left-moving and right-moving worldsheet operators, respectively, that contribute
to the graviton vertex operator. though these vielbeins may be assigned to dierent
worldsheet sectors, they are identical from the point of view of space-time geometry which
does not directly see the string worldsheet. however, t-duality acts dierently on the
two worldsheet sectors and one may expect it to transform the corresponding vielbeins

m ab eb

in dierent ways 1. that this is the origin of the dierence between ee(+) and ee() can be
argued as follows: the left-moving and right-moving worldsheet sectors are interchanged
under the worldsheet parity transformation    which also interchanges q+ and q
[4] and, hence, the two vielbeins in the dual theory. this suggests that eem
(+)a is t-dual to
the vielbein associated with the left-moving sector of the original worldsheet theory, while
eem
()a is t-dual to the one associated with the right-moving sector. this identication also
gives a heuristic understanding of the t-duality action (2) on the vielbeins: note that

1that t-duality could transform the vielbeins associated with the left- and right-moving worldsheet
sectors in dierent ways, is not evident from the transformation of the metric. this is because the t-
duality action on the metric is determined by the invariance of the energy-momentum tensor and not
that of the worldsheet lagrangian.

in at space, ea
worldsheet fermions m

 [2], which is consistent with the mapping of their associated wavefunctions

em
to ee(), as given by (2), depending on the worldsheet sector they come from.
the necessity of retaining both ee(+) and ee() in the dual theory is not evident if we

are dealing with bosonic elds alone. however, their presence is essential to insure the
consistency of the dual theory in the presence of space-time fermions, as will be seen in
the next section2. this implies that we have to keep track of how the vielbeins transform,
depending on the worldsheet sector they originate in. then, to reconcile the results
with the standard formulation of gravity with one set of vielbeins, we should use (4) to
in other
words, we have to augment the t-duality action on the left-moving vielbein by a local

sector contributes to the space-time elds. formulating the dual theory in terms of ee()
ee() = e without further eld redenitions (though this is not the case with ee(+), choosing

is natural since for self-dual backgrounds, q in (3) reduces to the identity matrix and

this translates to the t-duality action on the spinor index that the left-moving ramond

it will also lead to a physically equivalent description).

consider the space-time supersymmetry transformation parameters  and the dirac
matrices m = em
a a in either iia or iib theory. the majorana-weyl spinors  are
taken to be independent of x 9 and the subscripts  refer to their worldsheet origin
and not their space-time chirality which will depend on the theory and will be specied
later. after t-duality, we will have two possible sets of -matrices,

(+)aa ,

em

(6)

keeping track of their worldsheet origin, the spinors  in the dual theory are associated
(), respectively. the two sets of dirac matrices

with the dirac algebras generated by em

are related by,

with ,

1a = a

(7)

clearly,  is the spinorial representation of the lorentz transformation (4). the form
of , including its normalization, can be determined by the following argument: let us

one can easily verify that a

b is a projection operator of rank 1.
b(/x a)dx b projects the vector  = a/x a along the isometry
2that both vielbeins necessarily appear in the dual theory also follows from the t-duality action
on complex structures associated with extended worldsheet supersymmetry, in cases where the complex
structures could be constructed in terms of target-space killing spinors (for example, in non-compact
calabi-yau in 4-dimensions [13]) as discussed in [2].

generator k, which normalized to unity, is given by k = g1/2
9(/x a). the projected
component of  is then given by < k ,    >. the transformation a
b in (8) changes the
sign of this component, keeping other components of  unchanged. therefore, its spinor
representation  is obtained by multiplying the projected component with 11,

ea

99 119 ,

(9)

as can be directly veried using (7). the sign of  is not xed by these considerations
and its arbitrariness gives rise to dierent t-duality conventions as we will discuss later.
note the appearance of 9 = g9m m rather than 9 (as a naive generalization from the
at-space case may suggest) in this formula. this is related to the fact that, unlike in at
backgrounds (or more generally, self-dual backgrounds dened by q = 1), t-duality now
mixes x 9 with other coordinates x i when regarded as a canonical transformation
in the worldsheet theory.

to write the dual theory with a single dirac algebra basis, we express em
of em

(+) in terms
() using (7), and absorb  in a redenition of the spinor +, with  remaining un-
changed. this gives the t-duality transformation rules for the space-time supersymmetry
parameters , which are the simplest spinorial objects in the theory, as

e =  ,
e+ = a(of )  + ,

where ,

a(of ) = 1 .

(10)

note that e+ and + have opposite space-time chiralities, which is the basis of iia-iib

interchange under t-duality. the factor a(of ) (with o standing for original and f
for nal) reects the arbitrariness in the sign of .
it is used to denote a(ab) when
t-duality converts an original iia theory to a nal iib theory, and a(ba) vice versa. the
arbitrariness in sign allows for two distinct conventions: consider two successive t-duality

transformations along x 9. since e = , as can be veried using (1), we have e = 1. if
we choose the convention a(ab) = a(ba), thenee+ = +. in fact, with this convention,
all left-moving ramond states behave in this way and t-duality squares to (1)fl on the
spectrum (where fl is the left-moving space-time fermion number). however, since iia
and iib are dierent theories, we can also choose the alternative convention,

a(ab) = a(ba) ,

(11)

in which case, the t-duality operation that takes iia to iib is the inverse of the one that
takes iib to iia, and the transformation squares to +1 on the spectrum. in the following,
we use the latter convention whenever a convention is explicitly specied. the correctness
of equations (10) will be checked in the next section when we examine the supersymmetry
variations of gravitinos and dilatinos to extract their t-duality transformations.

unlike the at-space case, in non self-dual backgrounds the canonical transformation

that implements t-duality acts on both worldsheet sectors. explicitly [2],

these equations are non-trivial only for fx 9 and e9

for the rest. however, the invariance of  may tempt one to search for variables in terms
of which t-duality in curved space has the same form as that in at-space, aecting only
the left moving sector. to nd such variables, note that the matrices q, which have a
very simple upper triangular form, may be decomposed as

3 action of t-duality on gravitinos and dilatinos

in this section we will derive the transformations of the type-ii superstring gravitinos m
(not to be confused with the worldsheet spinors m
 ) and dilatinos  under t-duality, by
demanding compatibility between t-duality and space-time supersymmetry. again, the
 subscripts refer to the worldsheet sector in which the spinor index of the fermion,
i.e.
its ramond component, originates and not to its space-time chirality. all spinors
are assumed to be independent of the coordinate x 9 along which t-duality is performed.
the t-duality action on these spinors is independent of the r-r elds, which we set to
zero in this section for convenience. the case of non-zero r-r elds will be considered in
the next section.

let us rst consider the supersymmetry variations of the gravitinos m . with 
as the supersymmetry transformation parameters and in the absence of r-r elds, these
are given by

w 

m ab ab(cid:19)  +    ,

m = (cid:18)m +

m = 0 +    .

(14)

here,    indicates the presence of 3-spinor terms that we do not write down explicitly,
but which will be automatically accounted for in our nal result. w 
m ab are the torsionful
spin-connections given by

w 

m ab = wm ab 

1
2

hm ab .

(15)

the above transformations hold in both iia and iib theories, depending on the chirality
of the spinors. in our conventions, in iib,  and hence m have positive chirality while
in iia, , m have positive chirality and +, +m have negative chirality. the su-
persymmetry transformation generated by + () acts on the left-moving (right-moving)
worldsheet sector by interchanging r and ns boundary conditions. therefore, the su-
persymmetry variations m convert r-ns states into ns-ns states and do not get
modied if r-r elds are switched on. therefore, we expect that the gravitino t-duality
rules obtained from equation (13) are independent of r-r elds. the same argument
applies to dilatino t-duality rules.

let us now consider the gravitino supersymmetry variations in the t-dual theory.
first, note that the dual theory contains two sets of torsionful spin-connections, corre-
(+)m ab,

(+)m . we denote these by fw 

()m ab and fw 

respectively. one can verify that

(16)

(17)

since we have chosen to express the t-dual theory in terms of ee(), the supersymmetry
variations em in the t-dual theory should be expressed in terms of fw 

()m ab alone,

()m abab(cid:19)e +    .
em =(cid:18)m +
4fw

to determine e+m in terms of +m , note that using the relation (4) between ee(+) and
ee(), we can write fw +

now, using equations (10) and (16-19), along with the fact that qi

these are again valid in both iia and iib theories. in iib, both dilatinos have negative
chirality, while in iia,  has negative chirality and + has positive chirality. switching
on r-r elds does not aect equation (22). in the t-dual theory, written in terms of the

metry variations m and  to linear order in spinors and receive corrections cubic
in the spinors whose presence is indicated by   . from these we can read o the t-
duality transformations of the gravitinos and dilatinos, in principle, only to linear order
in the spinors. however, as we will show, the linear order result is exact and in fact, it
dictates the form of the 3-spinor corrections to the t-duality maps for the supersymmetry
variations above. thus, for the gravitinos m , we have the t-duality transformations

here,  is given by (9) and, as described below equation (10), a(of ) = 1 stands for
a(ab) if t-duality takes us from iia to iib, and for a(ba) if it acts the other way round.
setting a(ab) = a(ba) insures that t-duality squares to +1 on the spectrum.

that equations (28) and (29) do not receive corrections can be seen as follows: to
linear order in spinors, these equations are uniquely determined by (20), (21) and (26),
(27) thus only leaving the possibility of adding corrections cubic in the spinors. the
presence of such terms, however, can be ruled out on general grounds as they would give
rise to derivative interactions for the spinors in the dual supergravity action. to rule out,
in a more concrete way, the existence of both 3-spinor corrections as well as corrections
proportional to r-r elds, we consider the supersymmetry variations of the ns-ns elds
gm n , bm n and  given by equations (c.6) in the appendix. these variations contain
no r-r elds and are only bilinear in spinors. using (1) along with (28) and (29) one
can easily verify that that these variations are consistent with t-duality. on the other
hand, if (28) and (29) contained either 3-spinor terms or r-r dependent terms, this would
not be the case. this establishes that the spinor t-duality rules given above are exact.
note that the ns-ns supersymmetry variations (c.6) are insensitive to the multiplicative
factor . therefore, while they can be used to rule out additional additive contributions
to (28) and (29), they cannot be used to infer the existence of  in these transformations.

for supersymmetric backgrounds, when the fermionic backgrounds  and  along
with their supersymmetry variations are set to zero, equations (13) and (22) reduce to the
string theoretic killing spinor equations for . equations (28) and (29) are then trivial
for the background spinors, but can be used to obtain the t-duality transformation of
the fermionic excitations around supersymmetric backgrounds. in some cases, when the
killing spinor itself does not transform (as is the case with ), the compatibility of the
killing spinor equation with t-duality was investigated in [10, 11].

4 r-r t-duality revisited

as shown above, the t-duality rules for space-time fermions do not depend on the r-r
elds. in this section we use these rules, along with the requirement of compatibility of
t-duality with space-time supersymmetry, to determine the t-duality rules for r-r elds
and discuss some related issues. most of the results in this section are not new but are
re-derived here in a unied and more convenient way. the iia/iib t-duality rules for r-r
elds were derived in [14] by studying the equaitons of motion and in [15] by dimensional
reduction of the wess-zumino term in the d-brane worldvolume action, both considering
the bosonic sector alone (also see [19]). our derivation of these rules here emphasizes
the compatibility of the t-duality conventions used for the r-r elds with those used for
the spinors. the t-duality rules relating iib to the massive iia theory were obtained
in [16, 17, 18]. here we re-derive these rules for generic congurations, emphasizing how
potential non-localities in the t-duality rules for r-r potentials are avoided. we also
present a simple derivation of the mass-dependent terms in the wess-zumino action for
massive iia branes using t-duality.

10

in the presence of r-r backgrounds, the supersymmetry variations ++m and m
are still given by (13), while +m and +m are no longer zero and receive contribu-
tions from r-r elds. the same is true for the dilatino variations . the t-duality
rules for the r-r elds can be obtained by considering any one of these variations, say
+m . in type iia theory, this variation is given by [20] (see appendix c for details),

where    denote 3-spinor terms as usual. f (0) = m is the mass parameter of massive
type-iia theory and the eld strengths f (n) for the massive theory are given by (c.3)

in exactly the same way as for the r-r vertex operator in at space (see, for example,
[6, 7]), the actual content of the above equation is determined by the chirality of the space-
time spinors: in type-iib theory, both  and +m have positive chirality and therefore
the summation contains only terms with even number of -matrices (corresponding to
n = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9), whereas in iia,  and +m have positive and negative chiralities re-
spectively and hence only terms with even n (n = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) enter the summation.
furthermore, using the -matrix identity (a.2), the positive chirality of  implies that
f (n) = (1)n(n1)/2 f (10n). this allows us to write the summation in term of f (n) with
n  5 alone, recovering (30) and (31).

let us now consider the above equation in the t-dual theory expressed in terms of the

using equations (2), (6), (10) and (28), one can readily obtain the t-duality transforma-
tion for the r-r eld strengths as

m1mn = (1)na(of )(cid:16)f (n+1)

where, a(of ) denotes a convention dependent sign as explained below equation (10). let
us now choose the convention (11) so that t-duality squares to 1 on r-r elds. then,
using the form of q1
 given in (3), the above equation reduces to the component form,

9i2in = a(ab)hf (n1)
ef (n)
ef (n)
i1i2in = a(ab)f (n+1)

9i1in  nb9[i1 ef (n)

9i2in] .

99 g9[i2f (n1)

9i3in]i ,

(35)

(36)

a(ab) is still arbitrary and could be chosen as either +1 or 1. the antisymmetrization
denoted by the square bracket aects the indices in and not the index 9. since the spinors
were assumed to be independent of x 9, equation (32) implies that f (n) should also be
independent of this coordinate.

the above t-duality rules for f (n) are valid for both massless and massive type-iia
theories and can be iteratively integrated to yield the corresponding transformations for
the r-r potentials c (n). let us rst consider duality between iib and massless iia. in
this case, f (0) = m = 0 and the eld strengths are given by (b.10). c (n) can be chosen
to be x 9-independent and under t-duality transform as
i2in  (n  1)g1

9i2in = a(ab)hc (n1)

(37)

(38)

let us now consider the massive-iia case. for n = 0, equation (36) reduces to ef (0) =
a(ab)f (1) = a(ab)9c (0). as noticed in [16, 17, 18], this implies that type-iib theory
dualizes to the massive iia theory with ef (0) = m, provided the iib 0-form has an x 9
dependence given by c (0) = a(ab)mx 9 + c (0), where the last term is independent of
x 9. naively, one may expect that this x 9-dependence could lead to a similar dependence
for the iia potentials, which should not be the case: consider an x 9-dependent function

c(x 9), say, in the iib theory leading to an x 9-dependent t-dual ec(x 9) in iia. since the
natural variable in the t-dual theory is fx 9, which is related to x 9 through the canonical
transformation (12), ec has to be expressed in terms of fx 9. however, the relationship
between x 9 and fx 9 is non-local, involving an integration over the string worldsheet, and
hence ec is a non-local function of fx 9. this problem can be avoided if we arrange things
such that the x 9-dependent c dualizes to an x 9-independent ec, or vice versa. let us

dene

bc (0) = c (0) + a(ab)mx 9 ,
bc (2)
bc (4)

m1m2 = c (2)
m1m4 = c (4)

m1m2 + a(ab)mx 9bm1m2 ,

or more generally, using the notation of [18], with c =p9
bc = c + a(ab) m x 9eb .

eld strengths (35,36), along with equations (b.10) for type-iib and (c.3) for the massive
type-iia, one can obtain the t-duality rules for the potentials. these are still given by

we give the c (2p) in type-iib a dependence on x 9 in such a way that bc (2p) are x 9
independent, while in type-iia, bc (2p+1) = c (2p+1). then, using the t-duality rules for the
(37) and (38) but now with all c (2p) replaced by bc (2p). the x 9 independence of bc (2p)
of non-localities. note that while the massive t-duality rules, written in terms of bc (2p)

have the same form as the usual massless iia/iib rules, the two dier by m-dependent
terms when written in terms of the actual r-r potentials c (2p) of type-iib theory.

guarantees the x 9 independence of the iia potentials c (2p+1), preventing the appearance

the special x 9 dependence of c (2p) can be easily understood when massive-iia/iib
duality is regarded as a scherk-schwarz compactication to 9 dimensions [16]: the u(1) 
sl(2, r) transformation in iib theory that gives the right x 9 dependence to c (0), by
shifting it to c (0)  a(ab)mx 9 (corresponding to p = s = 1, r = 0 and q = a(ab)mx 9
in (b.5)), also produces the correct x 9 dependences in c (2) and c (4).

for m 6= 0, the wess-zumino terms in the iia d-brane worldvolume actions contain
m-dependent terms the forms of which were studied in [17, 18]. we will now derive these
terms in a very straightforward way using t-duality: let us start with the wz terms in
the d-brane worldvolume actions in type-iib theory and express the potentials c (2p) in

terms of bc (2p) as dened in (39),

i (iib)

w z =z2p

cef b =z2p bcef b  a(ab)mz2p

x 9ef .

(40)

w z

type-iia. therefore, on dimensional reduction, i (iib)
should reduce to the corresponding
action for massive iia theory, including the m-dependent terms. as mentioned earlier,

when c (2p) are chosen such that bc (2p) are x 9 independent, the dual theory is massive
the massive t-duality rules relating bc (2p) and c (2p+1) have exactly the same form as

the massless t-duality rules relating c (2p) and c (2p+1). therefore, the analysis for the
massless case, for example, as presented in [15], implies that the rst term on the right
hand side of (40) dualizes to the standard wz term in type-iia which is common between
the massive and massless theories. the m-dependent terms are contained in the second
integral on the right hand side of (40). let us identify x 9 with a worldvolume direction,
say , along which the theory is reduced. taking f to be abelian (f = dv ), we write

1

p!d(v  f p1) so that,
p!z2p
z2p

x 9ef =xp

1

x 9h(v  f p1)  d + (v  f p1)  dxi ,

(41)

ef =pp

where, x are the worldvolume directions transverse to . since x 9 does not depend on
x, the second term in the integrand leads to a surface term and can be dropped. the
(2p  1)-form v  f p1 in the rst term now only has non-zero components along x,
and not along . finally, remembering that x 9 =  and dropping a surface term, the

13

integration over  leads to

i (iia)

w z =z2p1

cef b + a(ab)mxp

p!z2p1

v  (dv )p1 ,

(42)

which reproduces the m-dependent terms of [17, 18] (we have ignored the d-brane tension
that can be easily inserted into the equations).

5 conclusions

we have shown that, besides acting on the space-time indices of elds, t-duality also has
an action on the local lorentz frame associated with the left-moving sector of the world-
sheet theory by twisting it with respect to the one associated with the right-moving sector.
this twist translates to the t-duality action on the spinor index originating in the left-
moving ramond sector, and xes the t-duality action on the space-time supersymmetry
parameters. the gravitinos and dilatinos also contain an ns sector contribution to their
t-duality transformations which is obtained by demanding consistency between t-duality
and space-time supersymmetry. it is also shown that the t-duality action on the spinors
is independent of the r-r backgrounds. the result is then used to re-derive the r-r t-
duality rules. we discuss the case of the massive iia theory in more detail, showing that
there exist variables in terms of which the massive t-duality rules for the r-r potentials
have the same form as the massless ones, manifestly avoiding non-local relations between
potentials. using this, we give a simple derivation of the mass-dependent terms in the
wz actions for the associated d-branes based on t-duality. in most part, we have explic-
itly retained the convention dependence of the t-duality action on the ramond sector.
in one convention, t-duality squares to 1, while in the other, it squares to (1)fl on the
spectrum, where fl is the left-moving space-time fermion number.

there are certain similarities between t-duality in at and curved backgrounds. at
the worldsheet level, as we have shown, there exist variables in terms of which the canon-
ical transformation that implements t-duality in curved space, has the at-space form.
one can also check that the t-duality rules for gravitinos and r-r elds in curved back-
grounds easily follow from their at-space vertex operators, provided we interpret these
operators as curved space objects (which, of course, is not really the case). for exam-
ple, consider the gravitino emission operator  s+ss
 in at space. to interpret
this as a curved-space expression, we dene the spin-led s+s as an operator that gener-
ates space-time supersymmetry transformations of s
+, but now in
curved-space. s+ and + will have opposite space-time chiralities and s++ is invariant
under t-duality. then using the curved-space t-duality rules for + (10) and m
 (12) in
the at-space vertex operator, we recover the t-duality action (28) on +m . similarly, the
r-r t-duality rules can be obtained from the corresponding at-space vertex operator,
 s+sf ssss, where f ss is the r-r bi-spinor.

note added: in a recent paper [22], which appeared after this paper was completed, the
authors consider the so(d, d, z) action on r-r elds from the point of view of low-energy
eective action. one should be able to obtain the same results in our approach, after de-
termining the so(d, d, z) action on gravitinos, and then using space-time supersymmetry.
the results are expected to look the same as the single t-duality case with q and 
appropriately generalized to so(d, d).

the gravitino and dilatino supersymmetry variations in type-iia theory are given in [20]
for massive iia. when written in terms of appropriate variables, they lead to the usual
massless iia equations when the mass parameter is set to zero. in the standard string
theory normalizations for the elds, these equations take the form,

the constant m is the mass parameter of the massive type-iia theory and the usual
massless iia theory is recovered by setting m = 0, in which case the these equations take
the form (b.10) above. the string frame metric and spinors are given by,

gm n = e/2g

let us consider the above equations in terms of the positive and negative chirality com-
ponents of  and other spinors. one can then see that the type-iia theory described in
[20] is the one in which the positive chirality component of  originates in the left-moving
worldsheet sector. however, in our conventions for t-duality, we need the iia in which
the positive chirality component of  originates in the right-moving worldsheet sector.

17

this iia theory is obtained from the one described in [20] by a worldsheet parity trans-
formation that reverses the signs of hm n p and f (2), keeping f (0) and f (4) unchanged.
