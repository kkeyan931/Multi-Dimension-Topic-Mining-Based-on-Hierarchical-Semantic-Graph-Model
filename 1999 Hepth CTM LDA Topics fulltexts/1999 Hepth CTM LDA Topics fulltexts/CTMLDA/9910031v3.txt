1 introduction

recently non-commutative yang-mills theory [1] attracted a lot of attention,
mainly due to discoveries of new connections to string theory[2, 3, 4]. in a
recent paper[5], it was suggested that the divergences of the non-commutative
yang-mills theory are dictated by the large nc limit of the theory. namely,
that divergences occur only in planar diagrams (the observation that the
planar commutative and non-commutative theories are the same up to phases
in the green functions, was already made in[6]. a careful analysis of the
divergences was carried out in ref.[7]).

another direction of research is the study of orbifold eld theories - mo-
tivated by the ads/cft correspondence [8]. it was conjectured by kachru
and silverstein [9] that orbifolds of ads5  s 5 which act on the s 5 part de-
ne a large nc nite theory, even when the r-symmetry is completely broken
and the theory is not supersymmetric. this conjecture was later proved using
both eld theory [10] and string theory [11] techniques.

in this note we would like to consider non-commutative yang-mills theo-
ries which are obtained by an orbifold truncation of n = 4 sym. we suggest
that these theories are uv nite, namely that there are no divergent feynman
diagrams, even when the theory under consideration is non-supersymmetric
and the number of colors is nite. note, however, that our conjecture relies
on recent suggestions [5, 12] about uv niteness of non-planar graphs in the
non-commutative theory. the later were not fully proved yet, but seems to
be necessary if the non-commutative theory is renormalizable.

2 orbifold eld theories

orbifold eld theories are obtained by a certain truncation of a supersym-
metric yang-mills theory. let us consider the special case of n = 4 . the
truncation procedure is as follows: consider a discrete subgroup  of the
n = 4 r-symmetry group su(4). for each element of the orbifold group, a
representation  inside su(||nc) should be specied. each eld  transform
as   r, where r is a representation matrix inside the r-symmetry
group. the truncation is achieved by keeping invariant elds. the resulting
theory has a reduced amount of supersymmetry, or no supersymmetry at all.
it was conjectured[9], based on the ads/cft conjecture, that the truncated

1

large nc theories are nite as the parent n = 4 theory. later it was proved
[10] that the planar diagrams of the truncated theory and parent theories are
identical. in particular it means that the perturbative beta function of the
large nc daughter theory is zero and that the theory is nite.

in the cases of n = 2 truncations, there is only one-loop (perturbative)
contribution to the beta function. its vanishing indicates the perturbative
niteness of the daughter theory at nite nc as well.

in n = 1 truncations the situation is more subtle. indeed, the theory is
nite at nite values of nc, but the niteness is due to leigh-strassler type
of arguments[13]. in that case one should consider the su(nc) version of the
theory (and not the u(nc) theory which is obtained from the string theory
orbifold), since the u(1) beta function is always positive at the origin. in
addition 1
n 2

shifts of the yukawa couplings are needed[14].

c

in the non-supersymmetric case there are no known examples of nite
theories at nite nc, though attempts in this direction using orbifolds were
recently made[15]. as we shall see, due to non-commutativity such examples
can be found.

3 perturbative behavior of non-commutative

yang-mills theories

recently, several authors[7, 5] analyzed the renormalization behavior of non-
commutative yang-mills theories (for an earlier discussion see[6]. related
works are [16, 17]). we briey review their analysis. the feynman rules
of the commutative and non-commutative theories in momentum space are
very similar.
in fact the only dierence is that each vertex of the non-
commutative theory acquires a phase, exp ii<jki  kj (the moyal phase),
with respect to the vertex of ordinary commutative theory[6]. for planar
diagrams, this phase cancels at internal loops and the only remnant is an
overall phase. therefore the planar commutative and non-commutative the-
ories are similar, in accordance with recent ndings[18, 19, 20]. in particular,
thermodynamical quantities such as the free energy and the entropy are not
aected by non-commutativity at the planar limit [19].

another claim[5, 7] is that the oscillations of the moyal phases at high mo-
mentum would regulate non-planar diagrams, namely that uv divergences

2

of non-planar diagrams would disappear. there are two exceptional cases
in which non-planar diagrams will still diverge[7]: (i). when the non-planar
diagrams consist of planar sub-diagrams which might diverge. (ii). for spe-
cic values of momentum (a zero measure set) the moyal phase can be zero.
indeed, it was shown lately [12] that in theories which contain scalars - there
are non-planar divergences. the theories that we will consider contain scalars
and therefore contain innities, however [12] interpret these divergences as
infra-red divergences. the reason is as follows: the integrals which are asso-
ciated with non-planar graphs converge unless the moyal phase is set to zero
by a vanishing incoming momentum. in this case new type of divergences
appear, and it seems that innite number of counterterms are needed. there-
fore the non-commutative theory seems to be non-renormalizable. however,
the authors of ref.[12] suggest that the re-summation of these divergent non-
planar graphs would yield a nite result. their observation is based on the
similarity between the present case and the standard (commutative) ir diver-
gences. note that infra-red divergences are, anyways, expected in theories
with massless particles. thus, truly divergences in the non-commutative
theory occur only in planar graphs.

4 finiteness of non-commutative orbifold eld

theories

let us now consider an orbifold truncation of non-commutative n = 4 sym.
these theories can be dened perturbatively by a set of feynman rules.
the natural denition would be to attach to each vertex the corresponding
moyal phase[6]. according to ref.[5], the only potential divergences are the
ones which arise in planar diagrams. non-planar diagrams are expected to be
nite, except for some accidental divergences [5]. note that the innities
which do occur in these graphs are associated with the infra-red [12] and
therefore do not contradict our claim that orbifold eld theories are uv nite.
according to the analysis of [10], the planar diagrams of an orbifold theory
can be evaluated by using the corresponding diagrams of the parent non-
commutative n = 4 . these diagrams are nite since they dier from the
commutative n = 4 only by an overall phase. in this way sub-divergences of
non-planar diagrams will also be canceled. we therefore conclude that any

3

orbifold truncation of non-commutative non-compact n = 4 sym is nite.
in particular, it means that we might have a rich class of non-supersymmetric
gauge theories which are nite, even at nite nc (in contrast to ordinary non-
supersymmetric orbifold eld theories, where the two loop beta function is
generically non-zero). note that though these theories might be nite, they
are certainly not conformal.

let us consider a specic example[21]. the example is an su(n)su(n)
gauge theory with 6 scalars in the adjoint of each of the gauge groups and
4 weyl fermions in the (n, n) and 4 weyl fermions in the ( n , n) bifun-
damental representations. it is the theory which lives on dyonic d3 branes
of type 0 string theory and can be also understood, from the eld theory
point of view, as a z2 orbifold projection of n = 4 sym[22]. the large
nc commutative theory contains a line of xed points. we suggest that its
analogous non-commutative (nite nc) theory is nite at that line. namely,
at g1 = g2 = h1 = h2, where g1, g2 are the gauge couplings and h1, h2 are
the yukawa couplings. note that in contrast to the commutative case the
position of the line of nite theories is not corrected by 1
nc

contributions.

finally, it might be interesting to understand how the niteness of these

theories arise from string theory orbifolds.
