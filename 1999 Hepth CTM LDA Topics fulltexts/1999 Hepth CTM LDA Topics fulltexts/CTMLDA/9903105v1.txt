recent progress in understanding the nonperturbative aspects of string theory [1,2] has
provided a unied description of the dynamics of the ve (perturbatively) consistent su-
perstring theories. the p-branes and d-branes, which appear naturally as solutions of the
string eective action, have a crucial role to play in these developments [3]. it is believed
that there is an underlying fundamental theory and the ve string theories are various
phases of this theory [4,5] and the low energy eective action of the fundamental theory,
named m-theory, can be identied with that of d = 11 supergravity. there is mounting
evidence that m-theory encompasses and unies string theories and governs string dynamics
in diverse dimensions. the bosonic sector of the low energy eective action of this theory
contains the graviton and the antisymmetric 3-rank tensor and consequently, the membrane
that couples to the three index antisymmetric tensor eld is expected to be the natural
extended fundamental object [6,7] in eleven dimensions. it is natural to explore whether the
fundamental (super)membrane can provide the degrees of freedoms of m-theory. it is not
evident that there exists a consistent quantum mechanical theory of the (super)membrane
[8]. this issue is very closely related with the large n behaviour of the u(n) matrix model
[9]. the proposal of the m(atrix) model [10] has led to very interesting developments [11].
the m(atrix) theory reveals various salient features of the m-theory. in this approach, the
dynamics of the eleven dimensional m-theory is described by the many body quantum me-
chanics of n d0-branes of the type iia theory in the limit n  . the compactied
m(atrix) theory gets related to super yang-mills theories through dualities. furthermore, it
provides a theoretical basis to the understanding of the microscopic dynamics of m-theory
and holds the promise of exploring various aspects of string theories nonperturbatively [12].
since the membrane theory provides an intimate connection with m-theory, there have
been attempts to study the supermembrane action in curved space with antisymmetric
tensor eld background [13] in spite of the above mentioned shortcomings. it is interesting
to investigate how much the world volume theories know about the spacetime [14]. one
of us [15] has investigated how the bosonic membrane theory is encoded with the target
space local symmetries such as general coordinate transformation and gauge transformation;
the former being associated with the graviton and the latter with antisymmetric tensor
eld. the strategy followed to expose these symmetries was based on the one proposed by
veneziano [16], in the context of string theory, to derive gravitational ward identities, and
by veneziano and one of the present author [17,18] to derive ward identities for various
massless excitations of strings: both compactied and noncompactied [19]. let us recall
the technique adopted in ref.[16-18]. a hamiltonian phase space framework is adopted to
obtain a hamiltonian form of the action. next, a set of generating functionals associated
with the local (target space) symmetries of the theory are introduced.
it was explicitly
demonstrated that the variation of the action, under these canonical transformations, can
be compensated by appropriate (gauge) transformation of the massless backgrounds. the
ward identities are derived with the argument that the hamiltonian path integral measure
remains invariant under canonical transformations, at the classical level at least.

a similar approach was adopted in the case of the membrane and it was shown that it
is possible to introduce canonical transformations associated with general coordinate trans-
formation and gauge transformation in the target space of the m-theory. of course, the
results for the membrane are to be understood as classical one in view of the preceding
remarks regarding the quantum theory of membranes. it is worthwhile to mention that the

2

the ward identities derived for membrane [15] are not easy to verify explicitly, unlike the
ward identities in string theory where one can obtain explicit expressions for the vertex
operators for some simple backgrounds and the conformal invariance imposes constraints on
the form of various vertex operators. in the covariant formulation, the vertex operators are
required to be brst invariant.

the purpose of this note is to derive ward identities for scattering of the antisymmetric
tensor gauge eld from a membrane, specically d2-brane, that appear in the type iia string
theory. in fact, the type iia theory is of special signicance since the strong coupling limit
of this theory in intimately related to the d = 11 supergravity [20]. thus the membrane
appearing in type iia theory is very closely connected with the membrane of the eleven
dimensional theory. we shall see that our test of ward identity will be at the level of
scattering amplitudes similar to the works in [16-18], although the techniques will be slightly
dierent. let us recall how the ward identities are derived in the string theory [16-18]:

z[j] = z [dx dp][dg]exp (ish [x, p, g, j])

(1)

here, z[j] is the generating functional, x represents the string coordinate, p represents
the conjugate momentum, g are the ghosts and sh is the hamiltonian action which is
a functional of coordinates, momenta, ghosts and the massless background eld j, which
corresponds to graviton, antisymmetric tensor or gauge potential according to the case at
hand. as mentioned earlier, one introduces a suitable generator of the canonical transforma-
tion, j [x, p ]. then it was shown explicitly that for the above backgrounds, the following
relation holds:

j sh = j

gaugesh

(2)

in other words, rst one computes the variations of x and p under j to obtain the
variation of sh . then, one checks from the l.h.s of the above equation that it is the same as
implementing general coordinate transformation or abelian gauge transformation associated
with graviton or antisymmetric tensor eld. in the case of compactied string the nonabelian
gauge elds are also permissible backgrounds and in that case the corresponding nonabelian
gauge transformation is to be considered in the r.h.s of the equation. now the argument
is that the hamiltonian phase space measure remains invariant under j and the variation
of sh under j can be compensated by appropriate gauge transformation of background j
leading to the relation

0 = j

gaugez[j] = hz ddx"i

sh
j(x)

j

gaugej(x)#ijbg

(3)

that

the expression is averaged with the path integral

here h...i means

r [dxdpdg] exp(ish ) the interpretation of the above equation is as follows:

factor
from the
preceding arguments z[j] = z[j + j
gaugej] leading to the equation (3). here jbg means
that the massless elds g, b or a takes their background values after the functional
derivative of the hamiltonian action is taken. notice that

sh
j(x)

= z d2(x  x())

lh
j(x)

= z d2(x  x())vj(x, p )

(4)

3

where, vj (x, p ) is the corresponding vertex operator for g , b or a depending on what
type of wi one is interested in. as an example, let us consider a quick derivation of the
gravitational wi, note that

gct g = g, g, g , 

using (3) and (4) we arrive at

hz d2hv 

g (x, p ){g(x)(x), +g(x)(x), +g(x), (x)}iigbg = 0

(5)

(6)

here (x) is the local parameter associated with innitesimal general coordinate trans-
formation. since it is an arbitrary parameter, if we dierentiate the above equation with
respect to  and set  = 0 the r.h.s will be still zero. furthermore, we can take functional
derivatives of the whole expression with respect to a string of gs and set eventually the
metric to be at space metric (for simplicity) to arrive at

n

g11(y1)...gnn(yn)

hz d2v 

g {g (x  x)+g(x  x)

+g, (x  x)}ig= = 0

(7)

note that the functional derivatives of metric act in three ways: rst when it acts on
the path integral factor buried in h...i it brings down the vertex operator v 
g (x), in this
case; second, if there is any g dependence in the vertex operator in the above expression,
it removes that g and introduces a factor of (yi  x) and thirdly it kills the factor of
g which exists inside the curly bracket. the wi is rather transparent if one takes the
fourier transform. the derivatives of delta function will give factors of momenta. thus
(n + 1)-graviton amplitude gets related to lower point amplitudes. we also know that brst
invariance will impose constraints on the vertex operators.

we shall adopt following prescription to derive wi for the scattering of three index
antisymmetric tensor eld of type iia theory from the d2-brane. notice that the three-
index potential (whose eld strength is four index antisymmetric tensor) comes from the
rr sector. first, we obtain the vertex operator for the three index antisymmetric tensor
eld in the type iia theory. the amplitude for scattering of the gauge boson from the d2-
brane is obtained using the techniques of conformal eld theory. as is well known the vertex
operators must be brst invariant and the prescription of deriving them in the covariant
formulation of superstring was given by friedan, martinec and shenker [21]. finally, one
can explicitly check that the wi are satised when the scattering amplitude, after separating
out the kinematical factors, is contracted with the momenta of the incoming or outgoing
gauge bosons.

let us recall that the massless excitations of the type ii theory arise from the product
of the left and right moving sectors involving ns-ns and rr oscillators. we can represent
this as

here ,  refer to the ns-ns sector and ,  correspond to the rr sector; the former being
spacetime indices take values 0,1...9 and the latter are spinor indices. the familiar bosonic

|ir  |il

(8)

elds are graviton, dilaton and the antisymmetric tensor coming from the ns-ns sector.
furthermore, the bosonic elds originating from rr sector appear as bispinors in the vertex
operator

vrr = fu 

(9)

the bispinor f can be expanded in terms of a complete basis of the ten dimensional gamma
matrices (antisymmetric products) as follows

f =

ik
k!

10

xk=0

f12...k(1...k)

(10)

where the k-dimensional tensor 1...k is constructed from the ten dimensional gamma
matrices and it is antisymmetric with respect to all its indices. therefore, the tensors f1...k
appearing the above equation are antisymmetric in their indices and one concludes that the
massless rr elds are antisymmetric lorentz tensors. as the bispinors have denite chirality
projections, thus all the components of the fs are not independent. as a consequence, type
iia theory has only eld strengths corresponding to even integers of k and type iib contains
eld strengths with odd integers of k. the former admits only even branes and the latter
only odd ones, as is well known.

in the covariant formulation of superstring [21] the vertex operators involving rr elds
contain the spin eld s, the bosonized ghost  and of course the plane wave piece eik.x.
their combinations have to be such that the vertex operator commutes with the brst
charge. generically, we can write

u 

 = v( 1

2 )(z) v 
( 1

2 )(z)

with

v( 1

2 )(z) = e 1

2 (z)s(z)eikx(z)

(11)

(12)

note that the bar on the argument of the vertex operator refers to complex conjugation
here and everywhere. moreover, the  matrices are 32  32 dimensional and have the
representation

0 !
 =   0 




(13)

satisfying the anticommutation relation {, } = 2 with  = diag (1, 1...1); fur-
thermore, 11 = 0...9 = diag (1, 1). the standard method for the construction of s is
[21] to bosonize the worldsheet fermions, and introduce a cocycle operator. in the case of
d-brane some of the coordinates (and therefore also worldsheet fermions) satisfy dirichlet or
neumann boundary condition. thus s(z) and s(z) get related depending on the dp-brane
one is considering. in our case, iia,

s(z) = m s(z)

(14)

with m = 0....p for dp-brane which are even.

let us consider scattering of massless r-r 3-form states in type-iia o a d2-brane

target. in components form the 4-form eld-strength is given by

f = c   c + c  c

where c is the 3-form potential. now, in the absence of the antisymmetric tensor eld
b the chern-simons like term (f  f  b), where b is the ns-ns 2-form potential, is not
present in the low energy eective action; therefore, the equation of motion for the rr eld
strength is given by

now we choose a plane wave ansatz for the gauge potential

where, k is the momentum, satisfying the on-shell condition (k2 = 0); and a
 are polariza-
tion vectors subject to constraints a  k = 0 as a consequence of eq.(15). the amplitude
for scattering of the three index gauge eld o the d2-brane involves computation of the
correlation functions involving two of the vrr operators:

a = z dz1dz1dz2dz2

(v ol)conf ormal

hv1(z1, z1)v2(z2, z2)i ,

(17)

where (v ol)conf ormal represents the conformal group volume factor that has to be factored
out and v1, v2 correspond to the vertex operators of asymptotically incoming and outgoing
massless r-r states. the precise form of these vertex operators for this case are given below

v =

the computation of the correlation function in (17) involve the correlators of four spin-elds
2 ( w), dened through (12), with the indices , ,  and
v 1
 are appropriately contracted with the products of f and the gamma matrices (see
eq.10). this is known and has been calculated in [22]. the amplitude can be computed
using the techniques of [21] as was considered by [23]. when the gauge potential is taken to
be of plane wave form, then the amplitude is given by the following expression

a =

(s)(t)

(s + t + 1)

[(s + t)p1 + sp2]

(19)

where, s = 2k2
2k and t = k1  k2, k1 and k2 are incoming and outgoing momenta
respectively of the massless plane wave states and kik are the components of ki parallel to
d2-brane. furthermore, p1 and p2 appearing in (17) are given by the traces of gamma
matrices.

where, c    = tr [012
012(1 + 11)]. now let us
look at the expressions for p1 and p2. each one can be written as a product of a tensor
involving only trace of the gamma matrices times another piece which contains polarization
tensors and momenta. let us denote them as t (1)
...  for p1 and p2 respectively.
it is easy to check that when the tensors t (1) and t (2) are contracted with k1 or k2, the
corresponding momenta of incoming and outgoing gauge bosons, then both p1 and p2 vanish
separately and therefore the scattering amplitude, a, given by eq.(17), vanishes. this is the
gauge invariance of the scattering amplitude reected through the ward identity.

...  and t (2)

we recall that when the brst invariance condition is imposed in the rst quantized
version of string theory on its massless backgrounds one obtains the equations of motion
for those backgrounds. for example, this requirement, in the ns-ns massless sector of the
closed string, imposes constraints on the polarization tensors of graviton and antisymmetric
tensor eld in addition to the mass-shell condition. similarly, if we consider the scattering
of massless rr elds the brst invariance restricts the form of the vertex operators as has
been investigated by polyakov [24]. for abelian u(1) gauge eld he derived the maxwell
equation by imposing brst invariance on the corresponding rr vertex operator for vector
bosons in type ii theory. for the case at hand, the brst invariance gives rise to constraints
on polarization tensor and mass-shell condition; in other words kf = 0 is a sucient
condition for the brst-invariance of the vertex operator (9). furthermore, it has been
shown [24] that one can calculate three point function, using the conformal eld theory
techniques, involving the dilaton and rr gauge elds. this interaction does not show up
in the string eective action expressed in the string frame metric. however, if one rst goes
over to the einstein frame by a conformal transformation (involving the dilaton) and the
redenes the rr gauge elds, the interaction terms involving the dilaton and rr gauge elds
can be exhibited and the correspondence with the three point function mentioned above can
be established. in the light of our investigation we can conclude that the derivation of the
ward identities for the scattering amplitude of d2-brane and 3-form potential is a consistency
check of the current conservation as is also reected in the ward identities associated with
conventional gauge theories.

we note that in the conformal eld theoretic calculation of the scattering process involv-
ing d2-brane and the three-index antisymmetric gauge elds, we do not see the eects of
the (f  f  b)-like term at this order. the presence of this cs-like term, at the tree level

7

calculations, can be seen if one looks at the (b  f  f )-vertex1 .

we mention in passing that one might envisage our results from the perspectives of m
theory. it is well known that if we start with the m-theory membrane and compactify one
of the transverse directions on a circle we obtain the type-iia d2-brane with equal tension.
furthermore, the antisymmetric 3-form in d=11 supergravity gives rise to the rr 3-form
under kaluza-klein reduction. therefore, the symmetries uncovered by the ward identities
in the scattering of rr 3-form from d2-brane in iia theory should also be obeyed in the
d=11 theory when one considers 3-form membrane scattering amplitude. we interpret it,
at the present level of our understanding, that this is an indirect evidence for the abelian
gauge invariance in quantized m-theory. another check would be to calculate directly the
scattering amplitude of the 3-form eld in eleven dimensional supergravity limit o the m-
theory membrane as the target. similar calculations have been done in ten dimensional
supergravity using extreme black p-branes as target and the amplitude has been compared
with the string calculation when the probe energy is small or the impact parameter is large
compared to the string scale. they seem to agree perfectly in this limit [23]. at this stage it
is not possible to compute the scattering of three form gauge eld from the membrane in the
11-dimensional theory in a reliable manner, as compared to the scattering of 3-form gauge
eld from d2-brane in the case of type iia theory using the conformal eld theory techniques.
it will be interesting to see whether such perfect matchings come out of a m(atrix) theory
computation. we may mention that the type-iia d2-brane being a dynamical object asks
for a consistent eective quantum description of the m-theory membrane by which one can
hope to provide direct checks of these symmetries in d=11, most possibly using similar
techniques discussed at the beginning of this paper and in [15].

in view of these results, it will be possible to derive ward identities for the entire massless
supergravity multiplets of the ten dimensional type ii theories and supergravity and super
yang-mills theories obtained from other string theories, although a partial results were de-
rived by veneziano and jm a few years ago [25,26]. we hope to report our results in future.
