abstract

models of interactions of d-dimensional hypermultiplets and supersymmetric
gauge multiplets with n =8 supercharges (d6) can be formulated in the framework
of harmonic superspaces. the eective coulomb low-energy action for d=5 includes
the free and chern-simons terms. we consider also the non-abelian supereld d=5
chern-simons action. the biharmonic d=3,n =8 superspace is introduced for a
description of l and r supermultiplets and the mirror symmetry. the d=2, (4, 4)
gauge theory and hypermultiplet interactions are considered in the triharmonic su-
perspace. constraints for d=1,n =8 supermultiplets are solved with the help of
the su (2)spin(5) harmonics. eective gauge actions in the full d3,n =8 super-
spaces contain constrained (harmonic) superpotentials satisfying the (6d) laplace
equations for the gauge group u (1) or corresponding (6d)p-dimensional equations
for the gauge groups [u (1)]p. generalized harmonic representations of superpoten-
tials connect equivalent supereld structures of these theories in the full and analytic
superspaces. the harmonic approach simplies the proofs of non-renormalization
theorems.

introduction

the harmonic superspace (hs) has rstly been introduced for the o-shell description of
matter, gauge and supergravity supereld theories with the manifest d=4, n4=2 super-
symmetry [1, 2]. the su(2)/u(1) harmonics u
i and corresponding harmonic derivatives
++,  and 0 are used for the consistent solution of the supereld constraints in the
n4=2 superspace. the basic relations for the harmonics are

[++, ] = 0 ,

the hs approach has also been applied to consistently describe hypermultiplets and
vector multiplet in d=6, n6=1 supersymmetry [3, 4]. it is convenient to use the total
number of supercharges n for the classication of all these models in dierent dimensions
d instead of the number of spinor representations for supercharges nd. let us review
briey the basic aspects of the d=6,n =8 harmonic gauge theory. the harmonics u
i are

used to construct the analytic 6d coordinates =(bx
coordinate , where , ,  . . . are the 4-spinor indices of the (1, 0) representation of
the spin(5, 1) group and =u
i i. the harmonized spinor derivatives and harmonic
derivatives have the following form in these coordinates:

where b = /bx .

the grassmann analyticity condition in hs is d+

 =0. supereld constraints of
d=6 sy m in the ordinary superspace (central basis or cb) are equivalent to the inte-
grability conditions preserving this analyticity. the yang-mills prepotential v ++(, u) in
the analytic basis (ab) describes the 6d vector multiplet (a, 
i , x ik) and possesses
the gauge transformation with the analytic matrix parameter (, u)

v ++ = d++ + [v ++, ] = ++ .

(1.7)

the action of the d=6 sy m theory has the form of integral over the full superspace

vanishes due to the analyticity of the parameter and prepotential. we have used here the
harmonic zero-curvature equation

d++v   dv ++ + [v ++, v ] = 0 ,

(1.11)

where v  is the connection for the harmonic derivative d. note that the supereld
density of the gauge actions in the full superspace is not invariant for any d in contrast
to the chiral density of the d=4 gauge action.

reality conditions for the harmonic connections include the special conjugation of

harmonics preserving the u(1)-charges [1]

i = ui ,

fu

(v ) = v  .

(1.12)

the physical elds of the hypermultiplet f i and  and the innite number of auxil-
iary elds are components of the analytic 6d supereld q+(, u). the interaction of the
hypermultiplet and gauge eld can be written in the analytic superspace

s(q+, v ++) =z d (4)duq+(d++ + v ++)q+ ,

(1.13)

where d (4)=d6xa(d)4 is the analytic measure in hs.

universality of harmonic superspaces is connected with the possibility of constructing
n =8 models in d<6 by a dimensional reduction. the hs analysis of the d=4 low-energy
eective actions has been considered for the gauge superelds [7] and for the hypermul-
tiplets [8]. the manifestly supersymmetric calculations in hs are in a good agreement
with the basic ideas of the seiberg-witten theory [6], however, the hs geometry allows
us to rewrite the chiral-superspace coulomb action as the integral in the full superspace

s4 = iz d4xd4f (w ) + c.c. =z d4xd8duv ++v [f (w ) + c.c.] ,

(1.14)

where f (w )=  iw 2f (w ) is the holomorphic part of the superpotential in this repre-
sentation and w = ( d+)2v . we have used the following decompositions of the chiral
and full grassmann measures in terms of the harmonized spinor derivatives:

d8 = (d+)2( d+)2(d)2( d)2 ,

d4 = (d+)2(d)2 ,

(1.15)

where (d)2=(1/2)dd

 and ( d)2=(1/2) d



d .

it should be stressed that the superpotential f (w, w )=[f (w ) + c.c.] in the full-

superspace representation satises the constraints
d+
 f (w, w ) = 0  w

d+


w f (w, w ) = 0 ,

which follow from the gauge invariance

z d4x(d)4 du   v ++d+

d+



 f (w, w ) = 0 .

(1.16)

(1.17)

representations of the action in the full, analytic and chiral superspaces are also important
for the hs interpretation of the 4d electric-magnetic duality [9].

the holomorphic action s4 can be reduced to lower dimensions, however, this reduction
does not produce the general eective action. the n =8 supersymmetries have some
specic features for each dimension based on dierences in the structure of lorentz groups
ld, maximum automorphism groups rd and the set of central charges zd. the main
result of this work is a construction of the coulomb eective actions for the dimensions
d=1, 2, 3 and 5 in the full n =8 superspace

sd =z ddx d8 du v ++v fd(w ) ,

(1.18)

where fd(w ) is the superpotential and w is the constrained (6d)-component supereld
strength for the u(1) gauge prepotential v ++. the gauge invariance of this action implies
the (6d)-dimensional laplace equation for the general superpotential

w

6dfd(w ) = 0 ,

(1.19)

which generalizes the 2d-laplace equation (1.14). the (6d)-harmonic solutions of this
equation can be used for a description of non-perturbative solutions in the n =8 gauge
theories. we discuss harmonic-integral representations of the d3 superpotentials which
allow us to construct the equivalent analytic-superspace representations of sd.
it should be remarked that the function fd determines -model structures and inter-

actions of the (6d)-dimensional scalar eld with fermion and vector elds.
tions of eq.(1.19)

renormalization theorems in this approach are connected with the rd-invariant solu-

d (wd) = g2
f r

d + kdwd4

d

,

d 6= 4 ,

(1.20)
where the invariant supereld wd can be interpreted as a length in the (6d)-moduli
space, and gd and kd are coupling constants.
the eective actions of the [u(1)]p gauge theories are considered also by these methods.
the matrix superpotentials of these theories satisfy the (6d)p-dimensional laplace-type
equations which are evident for d=4 and 5, and also for the d3 superpotentials in
the harmonic-integral representations. the harmonic structures of moduli spaces for the
d3, n =8 theories arising in connection with the equations for superpotentials generalize
the original su(2)-harmonic structure of the d4,n =8 theories. these structures are
necessary to classify various d3 supermultiplets. all alternative grassmann analyticities
are compatible with basic supersymmetries and reect the rich hs geometry of these
supersymmetric theories.

sect.2 is devoted to the 5-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories. the hs ap-
proach is natural for the perturbative and nonperturbative analysis of these theories. the
unique eective abelian action of the d=5 theory in hs contains the free terms and
the cubic chern-simons terms. this uniqueness is the symmetry basis of the quantum
stability of these theories. we also construct the non-abelian supereld chern-simons
term.

in sect.3, we consider the biharmonic superspace (bhs) using harmonics of the auto-
morphism group sul(2)sur(2) in the d=3, n =8 models. the 3-dimensional l-vector
multiplet can be described in terms of the sul(2) harmonics, however, the sur(2) har-
monics arise in the integral representation of the general d=3 low-energy superpotential

3

f3. the grassmann r-analyticity generalizes the holomorphicity in the hs description of
the 3d low-energy actions. the l-analytic gauge prepotentials and hypermultiplets have
their mirror partners in the r-analytic superspace.

the d=2, (4, 4) models in the triharmonic suc(2)sul(2)sur(2) superspace (t hs)
[31, 32, 33] are discussed in sect.4. we underline the importance of the (4,4) gauge theory
and derive the formula for the eective action in the full superspace using the suc(2) har-
monics. the integral representation of the d=2 superpotential f2 in the sul(2)sur(2)
harmonic space contains the rl-analytic function of the primary analytic supereld. the
full-superspace eective action is equivalent to the action in the rl-analytic superspace.
the c-, l- and r-analytic superspaces are convenient in classifying the (4,4) representations
and duality relations.

the one-dimensional models with 8 supercharges are used in matrix theory describ-
ing the d0-d4 brane interactions. these models have been intensively studied in the
eld-component formalism and the n =4 superspace. an adequate supereld description
of the d=1,n =8 theories requires the use of harmonics for the automorphism group
r1=suc(2)spin(5). we dene the corresponding bhs gauge and hypermultiplet mod-
els in sect.5.
problems of the n =8 gauge theories have earlier been discussed in the framework
of the component-eld formalism or the formalism with n =4, d=1, 2, 3 superelds (see
e.g.[12, 14, 36, 41]). in particular, the (6d) laplace equations have been considered
in the n =4 supereld formalism of the n =8 gauge theories and in the formalism of the
corresponding -models. nevertheless, it should be stressed that the manifestly covariant
hs approach provides the most adequate and universal methods to solve the problems
of the n =8 theories in all dimensions. a short discussion of these ideas has also been
presented in [10].
it should be remarked that the general mathematical formalism for low-dimensional
harmonic superspaces has been considered in ref. [11]. this approach treats hs as homo-
geneous spaces of corresponding complex superconformal groups. we do not discuss the
superconformal transformations in this paper and use harmonic variables to nd covari-
ant separations of the spinor coordinates in the supereld theories. our formulations of
dierent harmonic superspaces are connected with the alternative o-shell representations
of low-dimensional supermultiplets, their interactions and duality relations.

five-dimensional harmonic gauge theories

the consistent non-anomalous ve-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories have been
discussed in refs.[12, 13]. the coulomb phase of these theories contains the cubic 5d
chern-simons terms for the gauge elds and cubic interaction of the scalar elds. we
shall consider the d=5, n =8 hs-formalism which is very natural for the perturbative
and nonperturbative analysis of quantum problems in these theories.
let us consider rstly the harmonic superspace with the d=5, n =8 supersymmetry.
the general ve-dimensional superspace has the coordinates z=(xm, 
i ), where m and
 are the 5-vector and 4-spinor indices of the lorentz group l5=so(4, 1), respectively,
and i is the 2-spinor index of the automorphism group r5=su(2). the spinors of l5 are
equivalent to the pair of the sl(2, c) spinors: =(,  ).

the invariant symplectic matrices  and  can be constructed in terms of the

the corresponding representation of the 5d cliord algebra has the following form:

this supereld satises the following constraints:

d(+2)
 wa = 0 ,

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

where the relations (1.11) and (2.15) are used. the abelian supereld wa=w does not
depend on harmonics.

the 5d sy m action has the universal form (1.8) in the full harmonic superspace. the
sy m equations d(+4)v =0 have the vacuum abelian solution v=i(2)z where z is
the linear combination of the cartan generators of the gauge group ( see the analogous
d=4 solution in ref.[8]). this vacuum solution spontaneously breaks the gauge symme-
try, but it conserves the d=5 supersymmetry with the central charge and produces bp s
masses of the z-charged elds. the harmonic supergraphs of this theory can be con-
structed by the analogy with refs.[2, 3]. we do not analyze here the one-loop contribution
to the low-energy eective action of this non-renormalizable theory, however, it is not

6

dicult to consider the general symmetric framework for the description of such actions
in hs.

chiral superspaces are not lorentz-covariant in the case d=5, so one can use the
full or analytic superspaces only. it is readily to construct the most general low-energy
eective u(1)-gauge action in the full n =8 harmonic superspace
5 + k5w ] ,

s5 =z d5xd8du v ++v [g2

(2.22)

where g5 is the coupling constant of dimension 1/2, and k is the dimensionless constant of
the 5d chern-simons interaction. note that the next-to-leading order eective abelian
5d action can be written via the manifestly gauge invariant function h(w), but we do
not consider these terms.

the linear superpotential f5=g2

5 + k5w is a solution of the constraints

df5 = 0 ,

d(+2)

 f5 = 0 ,

(2.23)

which arise from the gauge invariance of s5.

it is evident in the hs approach that the unique eective action f5 cannot be renor-
malized by any consistent calculations preserving the supersymmetry and u(1)-gauge
symmetry.

note that the r5 invariance of the eective action can be broken by the fayet-iliopoulos

term in the analytic superspace

sf i =z d (4)du iku+

k v ++ ,

(2.24)

which implies also the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry.

3 three-dimensional biharmonic superspace

three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories have been intensively studied in the
framework of new nonperturbative methods [14, 15, 16]. supereld description of the
d=3 theories and various applications have earlier been discussed in refs. [17]-[21]. three-
dimensional harmonic superspaces were considered in refs.[22, 23]. the most interesting
features of the d=3 theories are connected with the chern-simons terms for gauge elds
and also with the mirror symmetry between vector multiplets and hypermultiplets.

the d=3, n =8 gauge theory can be constructed in the superspace with the automor-
phism group r3=sul(2)sur(2). coordinates of the corresponding general superspace
are z=(x, 
ia). we use here the two-component indices ,  . . . for the space-time
group sl(2, r), i, k . . . for the group sul(2) and a, b . . . for sur(2), respectively.

the relations between basic spinor derivatives are

 , dlb

{dka

 } = iklab + iklz ab ,

(3.1)

where =/x and z ab are the central charges which commute with all generators
exept for the generators of sur(2). these central charges can be interpreted as covariantly
constant abelian gauge superelds by analogy with [8].

as follows:

the supereld constraints of the n =8 sy m theory in the central basis can be written
(3.2)
where m are covariant derivatives with supereld connections and w ab is the constrained
supereld of the sy m theory (l-vector supermultiplet)

} = iklab + iklw ab ,

 ,lb

 w ab = 0 .

note that gauge transformations in cb have the standard form

ka

 = [ (z),ka
 ] ,

w ab = [ (z), w ab] ,

where  (z) is the matrix gauge parameter.

the simplest constraints of the l-hypermultiplet are

 qi = 0.

(3.3)

it is evident that one can consider the mirror r-versions of supereld constraints for

let us consider the l-harmonics u

of the group sul(2) and the analogous
of the group sur(2). the notation of charges in bhs is (q1, q2). the
r-harmonics v(0,1)
constraints of the l-vector multiplet and l-hypermultiplet can be solved with the help of the
l-harmonics only, so we shall use also the notation with the one charge for the l-harmonic
superspace hsl which is analogous to the 4d hs. the r-harmonic structures arise in
the geometric description of the low-energy self-interaction of the l-vector multiplets and
dualities between l- and r-type supermultiplets.

is covariant with respect to the supersymmetry with central charges zab by analogy with
the case d=4 [8].

the l-analytic hypermultiplet q+(l, u)  q(1,0) has the standard minimal interaction
l  v (2,0) (see (1.13)). by analogy with refs.[3, 8], one can construct the free hs

where z =  + z abzab and d++v = v++. the manifestly supersymmetric pertur-
bation theory is the important advantage of the hs approach.

one can consider also the alternative 3d hypermultiplet l(l, u) and the l-linear

multiplet l(2,0)(l, u) satisfying the harmonic condition d(2,0)

l l(2,0)=0.

we do not discuss here the harmonic-supergraph calculations of the perturbative ef-
fective action and consider the general symmetry framework for these constructions in
the full l-harmonic superspace. the low-energy u(1) eective action can be expressed in
terms of the superpotential f (w ab) which does not depend on u

s3 =z d3xd8du v ++

f3(w ab) .

(3.24)

the corresponding bosonic-eld lagrangian contains the nonlinear -model interaction of
the 3-component scalar eld ab (3.17) and the non-minimal interaction of this eld with
the abelian gauge eld. all interactions of the eld ab are determined via derivatives of
the function f3(ab).

the gauge invariance produces the following constraint :

s3 = 2z d3xd8dudv ++
 z d3x(d)4duv ++

l

f3(w ab)

l d(+2)

 f3(w ab) = 0 ,

where the analyticity of v ++

l

and relations (1.11) and d8=(d)4(d+)4 are used.

this constraint on the superpotential is equivalent to the 3d laplace equation

 f3(w ab) = 0 
d(+2)





w ab

wab

f3(w ab) = 0 .

(3.25)

(3.26)

the general solution of this equation breaks the sur(2) invariance. the r3-invariant

superpotential has the following form:

3 (w3) = g2
f r

3 + k3w1

3

,

w3 =qw abwab ,

(3.27)

where g3 is the coupling constant of dimension d=  1/2, and k3 is the dimensionless
constant of the n =8 w znw -type interaction of the vector multiplet. this superpoten-
tial is singular at the point zab=0 of the moduli space. the eld model is well dened

10

in the shifted variables wab=wab  zab for nonvanishing central charges.
it should be
remarked that the supereld interactions of the 3d-vector multiplets with dimensionless
constants (chern-simons terms) have earlier been constructed for the case n =4 [19] and
n =6 [22, 23].
the eective action (3.27) is an example of the d=3 non-perturbative calculation
based on the n =8 supersymmetry and the r3-invariance. stress that the hs approach
simplies the proof of this non-renormalization theorem.
the general solution of eq. (3.26) can be written in the v-integral harmonic represen-

tation

f3(w ab) =z dvf3[w (0,2), v(0,1)

a

] ,

w (0,2) = v(0,1)

a

b w ab ,
v(0,1)

(3.28)

where f3 is an arbitrary function with q=(0, 0), and w (0,2) is the r-harmonic projection
of the basic supereld. the proof is based on the following r-harmonic representation of
the laplace operator:



acbd

ac = v(0,1)

w (0,2) (cid:16)

w (0,0)(cid:17)2

,

(3.29)

(3.30)

this solution is a covariant form of the well-known integral representation of the 3d-
harmonic functions [24]. the functions f3 do not depend on the projections w (0,2) and
w (0,0) of the supereld w ab while the holomorphic functions f (w11) of the chiral supereld
w11 are independent of the components w22 and w12. the v-integral representation of
only, so the representation
f (w11) can depend on the 1-st harmonic component v(0,1)
(3.28) is more general than the holomorphic representation of superpotential. we shall
show that the function f3 as well as the supereld w (0,2) satisfy the condition of the
grassmann r-analyticity.

l

.

(3.43)

it is clear that this representation of the l-vector multiplet is equivalent to the represen-
tation (3.18).

consider the r-harmonic decomposition of the full spinor measure

d8 = d(0,4)d(0,4) .

(3.44)

using this decomposition and eqs.(3.24,3.28) and (3.43) we can construct an equivalent
form of the eective action in the r-analytic superspace

s3 =z d3xd(0,4)dv[w (0,2)]2f3[w (0,2), v(0,1)] .

(3.45)

it should be underlined that this action with the gauge-invariant analytic lagrangian can
be generalized to the case of non-abelian sy m theory.

let us consider now the set of l-analytic prepotentials v (2,0)

theory and the corresponding r-analytic superelds w (0,2)
this theory in the r-analytic superspace is

the r-forms of the hypermultiplet constraints have been discussed in ref.[23]. consider

the supereld constraints for these hypermultiplets in the framework of bhs

are the l-harmonic derivatives.

these hypermultiplets are dual to each other and also to the r-linear analytic multiplet

qa(0,1)
r

= va(0,1)r + va(0,1)l(0,2) .

(3.54)

the duality relation between the r and r-linear multiplet is described by the action

z d3xd(0,4)dv{r[d(0,2)

r l(0,2)] + f (0,4)[l(0,2), v(0,1)]} ,

(3.55)

where f (0,4) is an arbitrary r-analytic function.

it is clear that the l-analytic hypermultiplets q(1,0)

and l are dual to the alternative
r-version of the vector multiplet which can be described by the r-analytic prepotential
v (0,2)

.

thus, the l-analyticity allows us to solve the constraints of the l-vector multiplet and
l-hypermultiplets, while the r-analyticity generalizes the holomorphicity and chirality in
the hs description of low-energy gauge actions and duality symmetries.

4 two-dimensional (4,4) harmonic superspaces

the d=2, (4,4)-supersymmetric eld theories describe 1-branes probing a background
with 5-branes in m-theory [28, 36, 37]. the two-dimensional (4,4) and (4,0) -models have
been discussed in the eld-component formalism and in the framework of the ordinary or
harmonic superspaces [25]-[34]. the 2d mirror symmetry and the (4,4) gauge theory has
been considered in the component formalism and in the (2,2) superspace [35, 36, 37]. we
shall study the geometry of this theory in the manifestly covariant harmonic formalism
which is convenient for the supereld quantum calculations. three types of grassmann
analyticities will be used to classify the (4,4) supermultiplets, their interactions and 2d
duality symmetries.

13

the maximum automorphism group of the (4,4) superspace is sol(4)sor(4); how-
ever, we shall mainly use the group r2=suc(2)sul(2)sur(2). let us choose the left
and right coordinates in the (4,4) superspace

zl = (y, i) ,

zr = (y, ia) ,

(4.1)

where y = (1/2)(t + x) and y = (1/2)(t  x) are the light-cone 2d coordinates; and

the following types of 2-spinor indices are used: i, k, . . . for suc(2); ,  . . . for sul(2)
and a, b . . . for sur(2), respectively. the so(1, 1) weights of coordinates are (1, 1/2) for
zl and (1,  1/2) for zr. the algebra of spinor derivatives in this superspace

{dk, dl} = ikly ,
y ,
{ dka, dlb} = iklab
{dk, dlb} = iklzb

(4.2)
(4.3)
(4.4)

contains the central charges zb.

the cb-geometry of the (4,4) sy m theory is described by the supereld constraints

{k,l} = ikly ,
{ ka, lb} = iklab y ,
{k, lb} = iklwb ,

(4.5)
(4.6)
(4.7)

where m=dm + am is the covariant derivative for the corresponding coordinate. the
gauge-covariant supereld wb satises the constraints of the (4,4) vector multiplet which
are equivalent to the constraints of the so-called twisted multiplet [25, 29].

the authors of refs.[31, 32, 33] have discussed three types of harmonics: u

i =u(1,0,0)
for sur(2)/ur(1). we use the
for suc(2)/uc(1) ; l(0,1,0)
notation with 3 charges in the triharmonic superspace (t hs) and the standard notation
in the c-harmonic superspace hsc. the basic geometric structures of the gauge theory are
mainly connected with the c-harmonics u

i and the corresponding analytic coordinates

for sul(2)/ul(1); and r(0,0,1)

the c-analytic (4,4) hypermultiplets q+
c and c have the minimal interactions with

. the corresponding hs feynmann rules can be formulated by analogy with ref. [2].
the hs perturbative methods can be useful in the analysis of the vector-hypermultiplet
matrix models with (8,8) supersymmetry, however, we shall discuss here the general
symmetry framework for such calculations.

the universal harmonic construction of the u(1) eective action with 8 supercharges

has the following form in the case d=2:

s2 =z d2xd8duv ++

c v 

c f2(wm) ,

where d2x = dtdx  dydy. the gauge invariance imposes the following constraints:

(d+)2f2(wm) = ( d+)2f2(wm) = 0 .

(4.18)

(4.19)

using the eqs.(4.17) one can prove that the (4,4) superpotential satises the 4d

laplace equation

w

4 f2(wm) = 0 ,

w

4 =(cid:16) 

wm(cid:17)2

.

(4.20)

the analogous 4d laplace equation in the (4,4) -models has been discussed, for instance,
in refs.[28, 34].

the r2-invariant solution of this equation determines uniquely the exact superpoten-

tial of the (4,4) gauge theory

(4.21)

the same function of the (2,2) superelds generates the r2-invariant kahler potential of
the d=2, (4, 4) gauge theory [36]. note that the kahler potential of the (2,2) formalism is
gauge-invariant by denition, and the 4d laplace equation arises in this approach from the
restrictions of the (4,4) supersymmetry; while in our formulation the analogous condition
on the (4,4) superpotential (4.20) follows from the gauge invariance. the manifestly
(4,4) covariant formalism of the harmonic gauge theory simplies the proof of the non-
renormalization theorem.

by construction, this supereld satises the conditions of the rl-analyticity

d(1,0,1)w (0,1,1) = 0

and the harmonic conditions

(4.24)

(4.25)

the analogous constraints on the rl-harmonic supereld q(1,1) have been considered in
ref.[31] (this notation does not indicate the uc(1) charge). note that the vector multiplet
(4.23) contains the eld-strength of the 2d vector eld instead of the auxiliary scalar
component in the supereld q(1,1).

the c-analyticity become manifest in the coordinates (4.8). let us consider the anal-

ogous rl-analytic coordinates which help to solve the conditions (4.24)

it is important that all coordinates c, c, l and r are separately real with respect to the
corresponding conjugation. of course, all these sets of coordinates are irreducible with
respect to the supersymmetry transformations.

the solution of the 4d laplace equation (4.20) has the simple harmonic representation

does not produce more general superpotentials. this can be easily shown for the polyno-
mial solutions of eq.(4.20).

consider the t hs decomposition of the grassmann measure

d8 = d(0,2,2)d(0,2,2) ,
d(0,2,2) = d(1,1,0)d(1,1,0) d(1,0,1) d(1,0,1) .

(4.39)
(4.40)

using this decomposition and eqs.(4.19,4.23) we can obtain the following equivalent rep-
resentation of the eective (4,4) action in the rl-analytic superspace:

s2 =z dldrd2xd(0,2,2)[w (0,1,1)]2f2[w (0,1,1), l, r] .

(4.41)

one can construct the eective (4,4) action for the gauge group [u(1)]p in the rl-

analytic and full superspaces by analogy with the case d=3 (3.46,3.47).

an analogous action of the q(1,1) multiplet and dual superelds (1,1) has been con-
sidered in refs.[31, 32, 33]. the relation between the c-analytic gauge supereld and
rl-analytic hypermultiplets is a specic manifestation of the 2d mirror symmetry [35].
consider the rl-analytic supereld q(0,1,1) in our notation. the r- and l-harmonic con-
straints (4.25) can be introduced via the rl-analytic lagrange multipliers

s(q, ) =z dldrd2xd(0,2,2)[f (0,2,2)(q(0,1,1), r, l)

the triharmonic superspace is convenient for the classication of the (4,4) supermulti-
(c, r, u, r) satisfying

plets. let us consider, for instance, the cr-analytic supereld q(1,0,1)
the subsidiary harmonic conditions

cr

d(2,0,0)

c q(1,0,1)

cr = 0 ,

d(0,0,2)

r q(1,0,1)

cr = 0 ,

(4.43)

where the analytic coordinates (4.34) and (4.29) are used. the cl-analytic supereld
q(1,1,0)

(c, l, u, l) can be dened analogously.

cl

thus, the alternative hs structures and their embedding to the general triharmonic
superspace are natural for the o-shell geometric description of the (4,4) supersymmetric
theories.

5 one-dimensional harmonic superspaces

the one-dimensional -models have been considered in the component formalism and
also in the framework of the superspaces with n =1, 2 and 4 [38, 39, 40]. recently, the
n =4 superspace has been used for the proof of the non-renormalization theorem in the
n =8 gauge theory [41]. this quantum-mechanical model describes d0-probes moving in
dierent d4-brane backgrounds.
it is interesting to study these models in the framework of the manifestly supersymmet-
ric harmonic approach. we shall consider the d=1, n =8 superspace which is based on
the maximum automorphism group r1=suc(2)spin(5) and has coordinates z=(t, 
i )
( i, k, l . . . are the 2-spinor indices and , ,  . . . are the 4-spinor indices of the group
spin(5)=usp(4)). the algebra of spinor derivatives is

, dl

{dk

} = iklt + iklz ,

(5.1)

where z are central charges and  is the antisymmetric spin(5) metric.

conjugation rules in the group spin(5) dier from the corresponding rules in spin(4, 1)

i = i

 ,  =  , z = z .

the cb-geometric supereld constraints of the n =8 sy m theory are

{k

(5.2)

(5.3)

where a traceless bispinor (or 5-vector) supereld representation of the 1d vector multiplet
w(z) is dened.

the harmonics u

(5.4)

the algebra of the c-harmonized 1d spinor derivatives resembles the corresponding
algebra of the 5d derivatives (2.13-2.15) with spin(5) indices instead of the spin(4, 1)
indices. in the case of vanishing central charges we have

where the  matrices of spin(5) are introduced.

these constraints are equivalent to the conditions of dierent (twisted) chiralities for

the superelds w13, w14, w23 and w24 , e.g.

d

1 w13 = d

3 w13 = 0 ,

d

1 w14 = d

4 w14 = 0 .

(5.12)

the c-analytic hypermultiplets q+(c, u) and c(c, u) can be introduced by analogy
with hs of higher dimensions. these superelds have the r1-invariant minimal interac-
tions with the prepotential v ++
. we do not consider here the hs perturbative analysis
of this model which can describe the d0-d4 interactions in matrix theory and restrict
ourselves to the study of a general symmetry framework for these calculations.

the d=1 low-energy u(1)-gauge action has the following universal form:

s1 =z dtd8du v ++

c v 

c

f1(wm) .

(5.13)

using the constraint (5.10) one can prove that the gauge invariance of s1 is equivalent

to the 5d laplace equation for the superpotential

d(+2) f1(wm) = 0  w

5 f1(wm) = 0 .

w1 = (w w)1/2

(5.14)

(5.15)

is the unique solution of this equation. the non-renormalizability of this superpotential
is protected by the spin(5)-invariance and the n =8 supersymmetry. note that the same
function determines the kahler potential of the d=1 gauge theory in the n =4 supereld
formalism [41].
by analogy with the cases d=2 and 3, the geometric description of the d=1, n =8
models requires the use of harmonic variables for the whole group su(2)spin(5). let
=u
us introduce now the biharmonic 1d-superspace using the suc(2) harmonics u(1,0,0)

the v-harmonic representation of the general 1d superpotential (5.14) is

where the real function f1 of the single harmonic projection w (0,1,1) and all components

proof is based on the v-harmonic decomposition of the operator w

completeness relation

partial solutions can contain the restricted density functions f1 of some harmonic
components v1 . . . and correspond , for instance, to the holomorphic functions of w13
and/or w14.

the v-projection (5.24) of the basic gauge supereld (5.9) can be written in terms of

the c-harmonic connections

w (0,1,1) = id(1,1,0)d(1,0,1)v (2,0,0)

the v-analytic coordinates v=(tv , (1,1,0), (1,0,1)) can be dened by analogy with

(5.4)

tv = t + i

2[(1,1,0)(1,1,0)  (1,1,0)(1,1,0)  (1,0,1)(1,0,1) + (1,0,1)(1,0,1)] ,

(5.33)

these coordinates are convenient for the v-analytic superelds.

using eqs.(5.27,5.23) we can obtain the v-analytic representation of the 1d eective

action (5.13)

s1 =z dvdtvd(0,2,2)[w (0,1,1)(v)]2f1[w (0,1,1)(v), v] ,

(5.34)

where the corresponding grassmann measure is

d(0,2,2) = d(1,1,0)d(1,1,0)d(1,0,1)d(1,0,1) .

(5.35)

the invariant eective action for an arbitrary gauge group can be constructed imme-
diately in the v-analytic superspace. the v-integral representation of the matrix superpo-
tential for the gauge group [u(1)]p in the full superspace satises the following conditions:




w

p

d(+2) f 1

bc = 0 .

(5.36)

the proof is analogous to the proof of the relations (3.50) in the case d=3.

the duality for the n =8 vector multiplet can be formulated in the v-analytic super-
space. it is not dicult to dene the triplet of v-analytic superelds which is dual to the
supereld w (0,1,1)

v = ((0,1,1)
d(1,1,0)v = d(1,0,1)v = d(2,0,0)

v = 0 .

these superelds have an innite number of auxiliary components.

the interpolating term for the duality relation has the following form:

where w (0,1,1) is treated as an unrestricted v-analytic supereld.
