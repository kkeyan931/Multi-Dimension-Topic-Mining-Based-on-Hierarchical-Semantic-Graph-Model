abstract

a necessary condition that a stackel-killing tensor of valence 2 be
the contracted product of a killing-yano tensor of valence 2 with itself
is re-derived for a riemannian manifold. this condition is applied to
the generalized euclidean taub-nut metrics which admit a kepler
type symmetry. it is shown that in general the stackel-killing tensors
involved in the runge-lenz vector cannot be expressed as a product
of killing-yano tensors. the only exception is the original taub-nut
metric.

1 introduction

the euclidean taub-nut metric is involved in many modern studies in phy-
sics. hawking [1] has suggested that the euclidean taub-nut metric might
give rise to the gravitational analog of the yang-mills instanton. in this case
einsteins equations are satised with zero cosmological constant and the
manifold is r4 with a boundary which is a twisted three-sphere s3 possessing
a distorted metric. the kaluza-klein monopole was obtained by embedding
the taub-nut gravitational instanton into ve-dimensional kaluza-klein

theory. on the other hand, in the long-distance limit, neglecting radiation,
the relative motion of two monopoles is described by the geodesics of this
space [2, 3].

from the symmetry viewpoint, the geodesic motion in taub-nut space
admits a hidden symmetry of the kepler type if a cyclic variable is gotten
rid of [4, 5, 6, 7]. in general the hidden symmetries of the manifold manifest
themselves as stackel-killing tensors of valence r > 1 [8]. the conserved
quantities along geodesics are homogeneous functions in momentum p of
degree r, and which commute with the hamiltonian

h =

(1)

in the sense of poisson brackets.

in the taub-nut geometry there are four killing-yano tensors [9]. three
of these are complex structure realizing the quaternionic algebra and the
taub-nut manifold is hyper-kahler [5]. in addition to these three vector-
like killing-yano tensors, there is a scalar one which has a non-vanishing
eld strength and it exists by virtue of the metric being type d.

for the geodesic motions in the taub-nut space, the conserved vector
analogous to the runge-lenz vector of the kepler type problem is quadratic
in 4-velocities, its components are stackel-killing tensors and they can be
expressed as symmetrized products of killing-yano tensors [5, 10, 11, 12].

the killing-yano tensors play an important role in the models for rela-
tivistic spin one half particles involving anti-commuting vectorial degrees of
freedom, usually called the spinning particles [13, 14, 15, 16]. the congura-
tion space of spinning particles (spinning space) is an extension of an ordinary
riemannian manifold, parametrized by local coordinates {x}, to a graded
manifold parametrized by local coordinates {x, }, with the rst set of vari-
ables being grassmann-even (commuting) and the second set grassmann-odd
(anti-commuting). in the spinning case the generalized killing equations are
more involved and new procedures have been conceived [15, 12]. in particu-
lar, if the killing tensors can be written in terms of killing-yano tensors ( and
that is the case of the taub-nut space), the generalized killing equations
can be solved explicitly in a simple, closed form.

in the last time, iwai and katayama [17, 18, 19, 20] extended the taub-
nut metric so that it still admits a kepler-type symmetry. this class of
metrics, of course, includes the original taub-nut metric.

2

the aim of this paper is to investigate if the stackel-killing tensors in-
volved in the conserved runge-lenz vector of the extended taub-nut me-
trics can also be expressed in terms of killing-yano tensors.

the relationship between killing tensors and killing-yano tensors has
been investigated to the purpose of the lorentzian geometry used in general
relativity [21, 22]. in the next section we re-examine the conditions that a
killing tensor of valence 2 be the contracted product of a killing-yano tensor
of valence 2 with itself. the procedure is quite simple and devoted to the
riemannian geometry appropriate to euclidean taub-nut metrics.

in section 3 we show that in general the killing tensors involved in the
runge-lenz vector cannot be expressed as a product of killing-yano tensors.
the only exception is the original taub-nut metric.

our comments and concluding remarks are presented in section 4.

2 the relationship between killing tensors

and killing-yano tensors

we consider a 4dimensional riemannian manifold m and a metric g(x)
on m in local coordinates x. we write the metric in terms of the local
orthonormal vierbein frame ea


ds2 = g(x)dxdx = xa=0,1,2,3

(ea)2

(2)

where ea = ea
dx. greek indices , , ... are raised and lowered with g
or its inverse g, while latin indices a, b, ... are raised and lowered by the
at metric ab, a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3. vierbeins and inverse vierbeins inter-convert
latin and greek indices when necessary.

the following two generalization of the killing vector equation have be-

come of interest in physics [22]:
(a) a tensor f1...r is called a killing-yano tensor of valence r if it is totally
anti-symmetric and it satises the equation

f1...(r;) = 0.

(3)

(b) a symmetric tensor eld k1...r
valence r i

is called a stackel-killing tensor of

k(1...r;) = 0.

(4)

let 2 be the space of two-forms 2 := 2t (r4  {0}). we dene
self-dual and anti-self dual bases for 2 using the vierbein one-forms ea [23]:

(5)

let f be a killing-yano tensor of valence 2 and f its dual. the sym-

metric combination of f and f is a self-dual two-form

while their dierence is an anti-self-dual two-form

an explicit evaluation shows that

(zi)2  11

where 11 is 44 identity matrix.

let us suppose that a stackel-killing tensor k can be written as the

contracted product of a killing-yano tensor f with itself:
 = (f 2) , ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3.

k = f  f 

we infer from the last equations that:

on the other hand the killing tensor k is symmetric and it can be di-
agonalized with the aid of an orthogonal matrix. its eigenvalues satisfy an
equation of the second degree:

(12)

in conclusion a stackel-killing tensor k which can be written as the

square of a killing-yano tensor has at the most two distinct eigenvalues.

3 generalized taub-nut metrics

for a special choice of coordinates the generalized euclidean taub-nut met-
ric considered by iwai and katayama [17, 18, 19, 20] takes the form:

ds2

g = f (r)[dr2 + r2d2 + r2 sin2  d2] + g(r)[d + cos  d]2

(13)

where r > 0 is the radial coordinate of r4  {0} , the angle variables
(, , ), (0   < , 0   < 2, 0   < 4) parameterize the unit
sphere s3, and f (r) and g(r) are arbitrary functions of r.

we decompose the metric (13) into the orthogonal vierbein basis:

1

e0 = g(r)
e1 = rf (r)
e2 = rf (r)
e3 = f (r)

1

2 dr.

2 (d + cos d),

1

2 (sin d  sin  cos d),

2 ( cos d  sin  sin d),

(14)

spaces with a metric of the form above have an isometry group su(2) 

u(1). the four killing vectors are

da = r

(15)

where

(16)

d0 which generates the u(1) of  translations, commutes with the other
killing vectors. in turn the remaining three vectors, corresponding to the
invariance of the metric (13) under spatial rotations (a = 1, 2, 3), obey an
su(2) algebra with

[d1, d2] = d3 , etc....

(17)

5

let us consider geodesic ows of the generalized taub-nut metric which

has the lagrangian l on the tangent bundle t (r4  {0})

l =

f (r)[ r2 + r2( 2 + sin2  2)] +

g(r)(  + cos  )2

(18)

where( r, , , , r, , , ) stand for coordinates in the tangent bundle. since
 is a cyclic variable

q = g(r)(  + cos  )

(19)

is a conserved quantity. this is known in the literature as the relative
electric charge.

taking into account this cyclic variable, the dynamical system for the
geodesic ow on t (r4  {0}) can be reduced to a system on t (r3  {0}).
the reduced system admits manifest rotational invariance, and hence has a
conserved angular momentum:

f (r) =

g(r) =

16m2r
4m + r

(21)

the metric ds2
g becomes the original euclidean taub-nut metric. as ob-
served in [5], the taub-nut geometry also possesses four killing-yano ten-
sors of valence 2. the rst three are rather special: they are covariantly
constant (with vanishing eld strength)

fi = 8m(d + cos d)  dxi  ijk(1 +

df 

i = 0 ,

i, j, k = 1, 2, 3.

4m
r

)dxj  dxk,

they are mutually anti-commuting and square the minus unity:

fifj + fjfi = 2ij.

(22)

(23)

thus they are complex structures realizing the quaternion algebra. in-

deed, the taub-nut manifold dened by (13) and (21) is hyper-kahler.

6

in addition to the above vector-like killing-yano tensors there also is a

scalar one

fy = 8m(d + cos d)  dr + 4r(r + 2m)(1 +

r
4m

) sin d  d

(24)

which has a non-vanishing component of the eld strength

fy r; = 2(1 +

r

)r sin .

(25)

in the original taub-nut case there is a conserved vector analogous to

the runge-lenz vector of the kepler-type problem:



k=

k  x x =

j +(cid:18) q2

where the conserved energy e, from eq. (1), is

(26)

(27)

the components ki involved with the runge-lenz type vector (26) are
killing tensors and they can be expressed as symmetrized products of the
killing-yano tensors fi (22) and fy (24) [11, 12]:

(28)

(cid:1) .

returning to the generalized taub-nut metric, on the analogy of eq.(26),
iwai and katayama [17, 18, 19, 20] assumed that in addition to the angular
momentum vector there exist a conserved vector

s of the following form:





s=



p 



j +



r
r

(29)

with an unknown constant .

it was found that the metric (13) still admits a kepler type symmetry

(29) if the functions f (r) and g(r) take, respectively, the form

f (r) =

a + br

r

, g(r) =

ar + br2

1 + cr + dr2

(30)

7

where a, b, c, d are constants. the constant  involved in the runge-lenz
vector (29) is

 = a e +

c q2.

(31)

1
2

if ab > 0 and c2  4d < 0 or c > 0, d > 0, no singularity of the metric
appears in r4  {0}. on the other hand, if ab < 0 a manifest singularity
appears at r = a/b [18].



it is straightforward to verify that the components of the vector

s are
stackel-killing tensors in the extended taub-nut space (13) with the func-
tion f (r) and g(r) given by (30). moreover the poisson brackets between the
components of

s are [17]:

j and





{ji, jj} = ijkjk,
{ji, sj} = ijksk,
{si, sj} = (d q2  2 b e)ijkjk

(32)

as it is expected from the same relations known for the original taub-nut
metric.

our task is to investigate if the components of the runge-lenz vector
(29) can be the contracted product of killing-yano tensors of valence 2. on
the model of eq.(28) from the original taub-nut case it is not required that
a component si of the runge-lenz vector (29) to be directly expressed as
a symmetrized product of killing-yano tensors. taking into account that
s
transforms as a vector under rotations generated by
j , eq.(32), the compo-
nents si can be combined with trivial stackel-killing tensors of the form
(r0ri + r0ri) to get the appropriate tensor which has to be decomposed
in a product of killing-yano tensors.





in order to use the results from the previous section, we shall write the
symmetrized product of two dierent killing-yano tensors f  and f  as a
contracted product of f  + f  with itself, extracting adequately the contri-
bution of f 2 and f 2. since the generalized taub-nut space (13) does not
admit any other non-trivial stackel-killing tensor besides the metric g and
the components si of (29), f 2 and f 2 should be connected with the scalar

conserved quantities e,
r0r0.

in conclusion we shall consider a general linear combination between a

vectors of the form

siab + 1

xa=1

raarab + 2r0ar0b + 3(r0arib + riar0b)

(33)

where i are constants. we are looking for the conditions the above tensor be
the contracted product of a killing-yano tensor with itself. for this purpose
we evaluate the eigenvalues of the matrix (33) and we get that it has at the
most two distinct eigenvalues if and only if

3 = 

1 + 2 = 0,
c

c2

d =

.

(34)

for example, if the above conditions are satised, the eigenvalues of the

matrix (33) for the third component s3 of the runge-lenz vector (29) are

1 =

1

2(cid:18)br cos  + (a + br)(cid:18)r1 +q1 + r22

(35)

with the eigenvectors

(cid:26)tan ,(cid:18)r1 + cos  +q1 + r22
(cid:26)(cid:18)(r1 + cos  q1 + r22

1 + 2r1 cos (cid:19) csc  sec , 0, 1(cid:27) ,

1 + 2r1 cos (cid:19) csc  sec ,  tan , 1, 0(cid:27) (36)

and

2 =

2(cid:18)br cos  + (a + br)(cid:18)r1 q1 + r22

1 + 2r1 cos (cid:19)(cid:19)

with the eigenvectors

(cid:26)tan ,(cid:18)r1 + cos  q1 + r22

1 + 2r1 cos (cid:19) csc  sec ,  tan , 1, 0(cid:27) . (38)

hence the constants involved in the functions f, g are constrained, re-
stricting accordingly their expressions. it is worth to mention that if relation
(34) between the constants c and d is satised, the metric is conformally
self-dual or anti-self-dual depending upon the sign of the quantity 2 + cr [18].

(39)

(40)

with respect to basis (5) the representation matrix w of (40) takes the

block diagonal form

w =(cid:18) w +

0 w  (cid:19)

0

where w + and w  are 33 matrices representing the induced linear transfor-
mation of the invariant subspaces 2
 respectively.. if the constants
c and d satisfy (34), the extended taub-nut metric (30) with 2 + cr > 0 is
conformally self-dual and one has [18]

+ and 2

w + =

c

2(a + br)(1 + cr/2)2 w0 , w  = 0

where w0 is a diagonal matrix

(41)

(42)

(43)

w0 =

 .

for 2 + cr < 0, the metric is conformally anti-self-dual and the expressions
of w + and w  are interchanged.

finally the condition stated for a stackel-killing tensor to be written as
the square of a skew symmetric tensor in the form (10) must be supplemented
with eq.(3) which denes a killing-yano tensor. to verify this last condition
we shall use the newman-penrose formalism for euclidean signature [24]. we
introduce a tetrad which will be given as an isotropic complex dyad dened

10

by the vectors l, m together with their complex conjugates subject to the
normalization conditions

ll = 1, m m = 1

with all others vanishing and the metric is expressed in the form

ds2 = l  l + l  l + m  m + m  m.

(44)

(45)

for a stackel-killing tensor k with two distinct eigenvalues one can

choose the tetrad in such that

k = 22

1l(

l) + 22

2m( m).

(46)

the skew symmetric tensor f which enter decomposition (10) has the form

f = 21l[

l] + 22m[ m].

(47)

taking again the example of the third component s3, the eigenvalues 1
and 2 are given by (35) and (37) and the tetrad (44) can be inferred from the
eigenvectors (36) and (38) through a standard orthonormalization procedure.
finally, imposing eq.(3), we get that (47) is a killing-yano tensor only if

c =

2b
a

.

(48)

with this constraint, together with (34), the extended metric (13) coin-
cides, up to a constant factor, with the original taub-nut metric on setting
a/b = 4m. note that in eqs.(35)-(38) the constant 1 is not xed. in fact,
the product of two killing-yano tensors f  f  is invariant under the rescaling
f   f , f   1
f . choosing adequately the normalization of the killing-
yano tensors, for 1 =  1
4m we recover precisely the original taub-nut
decomposition (28) with f  = fi and f  = fy normalized as in (22) and (24).

4 concluding remarks

the aim of this paper is to show that the extensions of the taub-nut geom-
etry do not admit a killing-yano tensor, even if they possess stackel-killing
tensors.

11



this result is not unexpected. the conserved quantities ki which en-
ter eq.(28) are the components of the runge-lenz vector
k given in (26).
in the original taub-nut case these components ki are related to the
symmetrized products between the killing-yano tensors fi (22) and fy (24).
adequately the three killing-yano tensors fi transform as vectors under ro-
tations generated by
j like the runge-lenz vector (32), while fy is a scalar.
the extended taub-nut metrics are not ricci at and, consequently, not
hyper-kahler. on the other hand the existence of the killing-yano tensors
fi is correlated with the hyper-kahler, self-dual structure of the metric.



the in-existence of the killing-yano tensors makes more laborious the
study of hidden symmetries in models of relativistic particles with spin
involving anti-commuting vectorial degrees of freedom. in general the con-
served quantities from the scalar case receive a spin contribution involving
an even number of grassmann variables . for example, starting with a
killing vector k, the conserved quantity in the spinning case is

j(x, x, ) = k  x +

i
2

k[;].

(49)

the rst term in the r.h.s. is the conserved quantity in the scalar case, while
the last term represents the contribution of the spin.

a hidden symmetry is encapsulated in a stackel-killing tensor of va-
lence r > 1. the generalized killing equations on spinning spaces including
a stackel-killing tensor are more involved. unfortunately it is not possible
to write closed, analytic expressions of the solutions of these equations using
directly the components of the stackel-killing tensors. however, assuming
that the stackel-killing tensors can be written as symmetrized products of
pairs of killing-yano tensors, the evaluation of the spin corrections is feasible
[15, 11, 12, 16].

if the killing-yano tensors are missing, to take up the question of the
existence of extra supersymmetries and the relation with the constants of
motion we are forced to enlarge the approach to killing equations (3), (4).
in fact, in ref.[15], supersymmetries are shown to depend on the existence
of a tensor eld f satisfying eq.(3) which will be referred to as the f -
symbol. the general conditions for constants of motion were derived, and it
was shown that one can have new supercharges which do not commute with
the original supercharge q = x if one allows the f -symbols to have a
symmetric part. it was shown that in this case the anti-symmetric part does

12

not satisfy the killing-yano condition (3). we should like to remark that
the general conditions of ref.[15] allow more possibilities than killing-yano
tensors for the construction of supercharges.

summing up, we believe that the relation between the f -symbols and
the killing-yano tensors could be fruitful and that it should deserve further
studies. an analysis of the f -symbols in the generalized taub-nut geometry
is under way [25].
