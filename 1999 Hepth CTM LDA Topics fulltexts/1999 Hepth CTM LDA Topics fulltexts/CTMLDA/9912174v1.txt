abstract

background independence of noncommutative yang-mills theory on rn is dis-
cussed. the quantity  f    is found to be background dependent at subleading
order, and it becomes background independent only when the ordinary gauge eld

strength f is constant. it is shown that, at small values of b, the noncommutative

dirac-born-infeld action possesses -symmetry at least to subleading order in  if

f damps fast enough at innity.

1 introduction

recently, seiberg and witten observed that ordinary and noncommutative gauge elds can be

induced by the same 2d -model action regularized in dierent ways [1]. then they argued that

ordinary gauge elds should be equivalent to noncommutative gauge theory, which, in a certain

limit, acts as the low energy eective theory of open stings. furthermore, they conjectured

that the noncommutative eective lagrangian takes the same form as the ordinary dirac-

born-infeld (dbi) action for the d-brane, except that the product of functions is replaced by

the star product and lorentz indices are contracted by the open-string metric g instead of the

closed-string metric g. the explicit transformation between the ordinary gauge eld a and the
noncommutative one a was given up to order  [1]. even at this order there is an ambiguity
in the general transformation between a and a, which, however, can be removed by a eld

redenition of the noncommutative gauge eld [2].

the classical -model action in a b-eld background has two abelian symmetries: one is the
u(1) gauge symmetry a  a+d , and the other is the -symmetry a  a, b  b+d,
which keeps b + f invariant. in [3] it was argued that the u(1) gauge symmetry is enhanced

to a u(n) when n d-branes coincide, while the -symmetry is believed to act on the u (1)

part of the u (n) symmetry. in the ordinary dbi lagrangian, the -symmetry is manifest. so

it is natural to ask, whether the noncommutative gauge theory has -symmetry or not if its

ordinary counterpart has this symmetry.

in ref.

[1] background independence of noncommutative yang-mills theory on rn was

considered.

in ordinary yang-mills theory, the gauge-invariant combination of b and f is

m = b + f . the same gauge invariant eld m can be split in dierent ways as b + f or

b  + f . in [1], it was shown that the noncommutative yang-mills theory on rn is invariant

under those dierent splitting, which was called background independence of the noncommu-

tative yang-mills theory. of course this is nothing but the -symmetry in the context of the

noncommutative yang-mills theory. what seiberg and witten did in [1] is that they analysed

the -symmetry in the framework of ordinary yang-mills theory on noncommutative spacetime.

since the ordinary gauge theory on noncommutative spacetime is supposed to be equivalent to

1

noncommutative gauge theory on commutative (i.e., ordinary) spacetime [4], it is interesting to

see how -symmetry is realized in noncommutative yang-mills theory on ordinary spacetime.

in the present paper we discuss the background independence of noncommutative yang-

mills theory on rn from the point of view of the noncommutative gauge theory on ordinary

spacetime. we rst give the explicit expression for the transformation between ordinary u (1)

gauge elds and noncommutative ones up to second order in ,1 which can be obtained from the

dierential equation given in [1]. we check the -symmetry of the noncommutative yang-mills

theory on rn up to subleading order. we nd that for the noncommutative yang-mills eld
on ordinary spacetime, the quantity q =  f    is background dependent for general f , and
only when f is constant we have q =  (b + f )1 which is background independent. the
measure dnxg/g2
y m varies with , but the noncommutative yang-mills action is invariant
under -symmetry if the ordinary eld strength f damps fast enough at innity. we further

show that the noncommutative dbi action has -symmetry in the case of small b (i.e., small

) up to subleading order. all of this indicates that noncommutative gauge theories, which act

as low energy eective theories of open strings, indeed possess -symmetry.

the paper is organized as follows.

in the next section, we rst give the expression for
the noncommutative eld strength f ( a) in terms of the ordinary a and f up to order 2.
we examine the quantity q and the measure dnxg/g2
gauge theory on ordinary spacetime. we show that the noncommutative yang-mills action

y m in the context of noncommutative

is background independent. in section 3, we check -symmetry for the noncommutative dbi

action for small values of b. in section 4, we present our summary and discussion.

2 background independence of noncommutative yang-

mills theory on rn

demanding that ordinary gauge elds that are gauge-equivalent are mapped to noncommutative

gauge elds that are likewise gauge-equivalent, the transformation between the noncommutative

1 the expression for a in terms of a up to order 2 was given in [5].

2

gauge eld a and the ordinary a can be described by [1]

a (a) + 

a (a) = a (a + a)

(1)

with innitesimal  and  (, a) .

the equation (1) can be solved by expanding it in powers of the noncommutative parameter
. the dierential equations, which describe how a () and () should change when  varies,

are given by [1]

 ai () =

 () =

klh2 fik  fjl + 2 fjl  fik  ak (cid:16) dl fij + l fij(cid:17)
(cid:16) dl fij + l fij(cid:17)  aki

replacing a by a on the right side of the above equations, we get the solutions up to order ,

and for u (1) gauge elds we have.2

to order 2,

to obtain eqs. (6-8), we solved eqs. (2) and (4) perturbatively, and we treat the ordinary f as

 independent, which is dierent from the following discussion about -transformations, where

f will vary with .

now let us consider noncommutative yang-mills theory on rn. the action is [1]

l =

with g and  dened by

1
g2

y m z dnxggikgjl(cid:16) fij  1

kl (cid:17)
ij (cid:17) (cid:16) fkl  1

 = b1,

g = bg1b,

(9)

(10)

where we have put 2 = 1 for simplicity. ignoring total derivatives and constant terms we

rewrite the action (9) as

with

l = 

1
g2

y m z dnxg tr(cid:16) qg qg(cid:17)

q =  f 

hence it is sucient to show that the action (11) is background independent.

consider the -transformation, dened by

f  f  b = f + 11,

(11)

(12)

(13)

which keeps f + b invariant. from (10) we know that under a -transformation  changes
as    + , while the ordinary eld strength f transforms as f  f + 11. here we
should point out that, even for small , we will assume   , and of course we only need to
keep terms linear in .

under a -transformation f changes as

f ( + ) = f + 11 (cid:0)f + 11(cid:1) ( + )(cid:0)f + 11(cid:1)

where h represents the  order terms coming from t(+)2  t2, which is obtained by
replacing one of the f s by 11 or an ai by  1

h = 1f f + f f + f f  1

where the leading order term is 11 (2) , the subleading order term is 1 and the

third order term is . since the leading order term 2 gives a trivial contribution to the

variation of the noncommutative yang-mills lagrangian, the subleading order term 1 is

enhanced to the nontrivial leading order and the  terms are lifted to subleading order.

before proceeding, we would like to compare  f () dened in (17) with the variation  f ()
in (4), which describes the variation of f under a change of the noncommutative parameter 

with the ordinary eld strength f kept xed. under a -transformation, on the other hand,

 changes, and the ordinary eld strength varies simultaneously to keep b + f invariant. in

5

(17), when we vary  (induced by changing b) we keep gs and g xed, and we are sticking with

point-splitting regularization. in [1], seiberg and witten argued that one can use a suitable

regularization which somehow interpolates between pauli-villars and point-splitting, then one
can vary  while holding gs, g and b xed. thus  f dened in (17) is conceptually dierent

from (4).

the variation of the quantity q dened in (12) is

 q =

k xkammnln (f )(cid:27) ,

(18)

where the rst term is of order , the second is of order , and the terms in the bracket are

of the order of 2.

the noncommutative yang-mills action (11) can be recast into

l =

1

gs z dnx det 

1

2  tr(cid:16) qg qg(cid:17) ,

(19)

where we have exploited the  dependence of g2

y m [1] and omitted an irrelevant numerical
factor. since we study the noncommutative yang-mills theory on ordinary spacetime rn, the

measure dnx is invariant under the change of . then the variation of the noncommutative

yang-mills action is

with

4(cid:0)tr 1(cid:1) tr(cid:16) qg qg(cid:17) + trh(cid:16) q(cid:17) g qgi

where s1 and s2 represent the leading and the subleading order, respectively.

(20)

(21)

since f is a total derivative for u(1) gauge elds,  in q can be thrown away up to a

total derivative. the leading order term in s is of order 3, and the subleading order is 4.

at rst, let us examine the leading order term s1 with

where from the second step to the last one we have integrated by parts. eq. (22) indicates

that the noncommutative yang-mills action is background independent at leading order if the

ordinary gauge eld a damps fast enough at the innity.

next we consider the subleading term s2, which is of order 4,

s2 = total derivative

which shows that under -transformation the noncommutative yang-mills lagrangian is in-

variant up to a total derivative also at the subleading order.

to compare our result with those in ref. [1], we dene the quantity q by

under a -transformation, the variation of q can be obtained from (18) and is given by

q = q   =  f

k xkammnln (f )

+ higher order terms

(26)

(27)

which shows that the quantity q is not invariant under -transformation for general ordi-

nary eld a up to the subleading order term, but when f is constant, we see q = 0 +

higher order terms, and in this case q can be expressed as [1]

q = 

1

b + f

,

(28)

where f is constant.

what we have learned from the above discussion is that when we consider the noncommu-

tative yang-mills theory on ordinary spacetime, the quantity q generally is not background

independent, and the measure

dnxg
g2
y m

(29)

should also be background dependent. however, the total noncommutative yang-mills action

is background independent if the ordinary gauge eld damps fast enough at innity. from

the equivalence between ordinary gauge theory on noncommutative spacetime and noncom-

mutative gauge theory on commutative (i.e., ordinary) spacetime [4], this implies that in the

context of ordinary gauge theory on noncommutative spacetime, the quantity q and the mea-
sure dnxg/g2
showed in ref. [1].

y m are background independent individually, which is what seiberg and witten

8

3 -symmetry in the noncommutative dbi theory

in section 2 we have analyzed the -symmetry of noncommutative yang-mills theory, now we

turn to the noncommutative dbi theory. the open string metric and the noncommutative

parameter  are related to the closed-string metric g and the constant background eld b by

[1]

g = g  bg1b,

 = 

1

g + b

b

1

g  b

(30)

the explicit expression for the mapping between noncommutative gauge elds and ordinary

ones is valid only for small , so we have to restrict our discussion to this situation. from

(30) we see that there are two possibilities to get a small value for : either b is very large

compared to g, or it is much smaller than g. in the case of large b, as argued in [1], the double

scaling limit should be imposed to make the model have proper sense, then the corresponding

noncommutative dbi theory is reduced to the noncommutative yang-mills theory. hence we

only consider the noncommutative dbi theory for small b. since at small b

 = g1bg1 +(cid:0)g1b(cid:1)3 g1 + o(cid:0)b4(cid:1)

and the b2 term is absent, we will see below that it is good enough to use  = g1bg1 if we
calculate to subleading order. then we have

b = gg,

g = g  ggg,

(47)

where we have exploited that  is an antisymmetric matrix and that g is symmetric, thus

tr (g) = 0.

the noncommutative dbi lagrangian is a total derivative.

which shows that the subleading order term of the variation of the noncommutative dbi la-

grangian is a total derivative under -transformations.

from the above calculation we have seen that the check of the -symmetry for the non-

commutative dbi action is high nontrivial, and we believe that if the ordinary gauge theory

has -symmetry, the corresponding noncommutative gauge theory should also possess this

symmetry.

4 summary and discussions

so far we have examined the -symmetry of noncommutative yang-mills theory on rn. we

have calculated the variation of the noncommutative yang-mills lagrangian including the sub-

leading order terms. we have found that the leading and subleading order terms in the variation

of the lagrangian are total derivatives, which indicates that the noncommutative yang-mills

action is background independent if the ordinary gauge eld damps fast enough at innity. in

the context of noncommutative yang mills theory on ordinary spacetime, we have shown that

the quantity q dened in [1] is not background independent for a general gauge eld a. only

if the eld strength f takes the constant value, the quantity q is background independent. for

the noncommutative dbi theory we have found that for small b the variation of the noncom-

mutative dbi lagrangian under a -transformation is a total derivative to subleading order.

thus, when the ordinary gauge eld damps fast enough at the innity, the noncommutative

dbi action possesses -symmetry, which is dierent from the ordinary dbi theory, where the

lagrangian is manifestly -symmetric. since our check for -symmetry of noncommutative

gauge theories, which act as the low energy eective theories of d-branes, is highly non-trivial,

we conclude that if the ordinary gauge theory has -symmetry, its noncommutative counterpart

should also possess this symmetry.

in the present paper, the -transformation is realized in the framework of ordinary gauge
elds, that is, we express  f in terms of a, f and , so that our discussion has to be re-

stricted to small values of . it would be interesting to see whether it is possible to discuss

-transformations on noncommutative gauge eld directly. in [6] it has been shown that -
symmetry could be modied in the presence of the beld, similarly to the -symmetry. under
this deformed -transformation, the b-eld transforms as: b  b (cid:0)f  1
4f f(cid:1) . it would

be interesting to study the relation between the deformed -transformation and the present

one explicitely.

recently, a hybrid point splitting regularization that leads to the seiberg-witten description

including the general two-form  was found [7]. this suggests an investigation about how the -

transformation works in the presence of the general two-form , since in this case we have more

14

freedom for the description [1], which now can be realized within the standard renormalization

scheme by some freedom in changing variables. we hope to answer these questions in the near

future.
