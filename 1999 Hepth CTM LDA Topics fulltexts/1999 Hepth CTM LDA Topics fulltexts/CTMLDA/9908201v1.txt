abstract: we examine adhm multi-instantons in the conformal n = 2 supersymmetric
sp(n) gauge theory with one anti-symmetric tensor and four fundamental hypermultiplets.
we argue that the adhm construction and measure can also be deduced from purely eld the-
oretic considerations and also from the dynamics of d-instantons in the presence of d3-branes,
d7-branes and an orientifold o7-plane. the measure then admits a large-n saddle-point ap-
proximation where the d3-branes disappear but the background is changed to ads5  s5/z2,
as expected on the basis of the ads/cft correspondence. the large-n measure displays the
fractionation of d-instantons at the singularity s3  s5/z2 and is described for instanton
number k by a certain o(k) matrix model.

1. introduction

in this paper, we shall be concerned with instanton eects in the gauge theory which, in the
context of n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory, have a very precise relation to d-
instanton eects in the string theory [14] in perfect accord with the ads/cft correspondence
[5, 6]. this relation can be seen in the dynamics of d-instantons and d3-branes in type iib
string theory. the world volume theory of n d3-branes is precisely the n = 4 supersymmetric
u(n) gauge theory, in the low energy decoupling limit where all energy scales are much smaller
than ()1/2 [3]. instantons solutions in the gauge theory are identied as d-instantons (or
d(1)-branes) bound to the d3-branes [3, 79]. the d-instantons are described by a world
volume u(k) matrix model, for k instantons, whose degrees-of-freedom correspond to the
adhm construction of instantons. this theory is the dimensional reduction of six-dimensional
n = (1, 0) supersymmetric gauge theory and has u(k) adjoint and fundamental degrees-of-
freedom, the latter arising from strings stretched between the d-instantons and d3-branes. in
the decoupling limit this adhm matrix model is strongly coupled and only certain terms in
the action survive. the resulting partition function is identical to the measure on the adhm
moduli space weighted by the instanton action constructed by purely eld theoretical methods
in [3, 10, 11]. remarkably, auxiliary scalars introduced to bi-linearize a certain four fermionic
collective coordinate interaction are interpreted as the freedom for the d-instantons to be
ejected from the d3-branes: they need not be bound!

at large n, the adhm matrix model can be approximated. the idea is to rst integrate
out the variables corresponding to d(1)-d3 strings, the resulting measure is then amenable
to a standard saddle-point analysis. from the point-of-view of the d-instantons the d3-branes
disappear to leave a description of d-instantons in a ads5  s5 background. instantons are
therefore a perfect way to see the ads/cft correspondence in action. it may seem surprising
that the gauge theory instanton calculation is done at large n with g2n  1 and yet we
nd perfect agreement with the supergravity regime with g2n  1. apparently there is
a non-renormalization theorem at work, which is natural from the supergravity side of the
description [12], but has yet to be proved from the gauge theory side.

since instantons prove such a powerful tool it is natural to study them in other gauge
theories which may or may not have a known dual description. this has been undertaken in
the following conformal eld theories:

(i) n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge groups o(n) and sp(n) [13]. in these

theories the dual is known to be the type iib superstring on ads5  rp 5 [14, 15].

(ii) n = 2 supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory with 2n fundamental hypermultiplets [16].

in this case the dual string theory is not known.

1

(iii) orbifold theories which correspond to certain projections of the n = 4 supersym-
metric su(n) theory [17] by a nite subgroup  of the su(4) r-symmetry group of the theory.
the resulting theories have either n = 0, 1 or 2 supersymmetries. in this case the duals are
known to be type iib superstring theory on ads5  s5/ [18].

there is another class of conformal n = 2 theories based on the gauge group sp(n).1
these theories have an 2nd-rank anti-symmetric tensor and four fundamental hypermultiplets
and are conformal for any n. this class of theories is thought to be equivalent to type iib
theory on ads5  s5/z2, where the z2 action xes an s3  s5, with four d7-branes wrapped
around the s3 and lling ads5 [19, 20]. what is particularly interesting about his case is that,
in common with the n = 4 theory, there are detailed predictions for instanton contributions
to particular correlation functions [21] which merit investigation from the gauge theory side.
this paper sets up the formalism which allows such a comparison. near the completion of
this paper, there appeared a paper by gava et al. [22] which, as well as setting up the same
formalism leading to the large-n instanton measure, performs this comparison and nds perfect
agreement with the ads/cft correspondence.

consider the gauge theory in more detail.

it is useful to use a mock n = 4 notation
for the vector multiplet and anti-symmetric tensor hypermultiplet. so the weyl fermions are
labelled a, a = 1, . . . , 4, where a = 1, 3 correspond to the vector multiplet, and are therefore
adjoint-valued, while a = 2, 4 correspond to the hypermultiplet. all elds can be thought of
as 2n  2n dimensional hermitian matrices subject to

where j is the usual symplectic matrix

x = jx t j ,

j =(cid:18)

0

1[n][n]

1[n][n]

0 (cid:19) ,

(1.1)

(1.2)

and the upper (lower) sign corresponds to the vector multiplet (anti-symmetric tensor hyper-
multiplet). with this restriction we see that the adjoint representation of sp(n) has dimension
n(2n + 1) while the anti-symmetric tensor representation has dimension n(2n  1).

in addition, we must add four fundamental hypermultiplets consisting of eight n = 1 chiral
superelds transforming with respect to an o(8) avour symmetry. the theory has vanishing
beta function for any n and when n = 1 the only the fundamental hypermultiplets remain and
the theory is equivalent to the conformal su(2) theory with four fundamental hypermultiplets.

1for us, sp(n ) has rank n , so sp(1)  su(2) although it is sometimes denoted sp(2n ) or even usp(2n ).

2

2. the instanton moduli space and measure

the adhm construction of instanton solutions [23] for gauge group sp(n) is described in [24].
however, rather than use the language of quaterions, we nd it more in keeping with the string
theory connection to think of sp(n) as embedded in su(2n), and use the adhm construction
of the latter suitably restricted. for a review of the the adhm construction for unitary groups
see [3, 25].

the instanton solution at charge k in su(2n), is described by an (2n +2k)2k dimensional

matrix a, and its conjugate, with the form

a =(cid:18) w 

 (cid:19) ,

a

a =(cid:0) w  a (cid:1) ,

(2.1)

where w  is a (spacetime) weyl-spinor-valued 2n  k matrix and a
valued k  k matrix. the conjugates are dened as

  is (spacetime) vector-

w   (w ) ,

a   (a

 ) .

(2.2)

the explicit so(4) vector components of a are dened via a
are restricted to be hermitian: (a

n) = a
n.

  = a

nn

  and the matrices a
n

up till now the discussion is valid for gauge group su(2n), however, in order to describe

gauge group sp(n) we only need subject the variables to the additional conditions:

w  =   (w )t j ,

(a

 )t = a

  ,

(2.3)

the remaining 4k(n + k) variables are still an over parametrization of the instanton moduli
space which is obtained by a hyper-kahler quotient construction. one rst imposes the adhm
constraints:

d 

  w w  + a a

  =  

 ,

(2.4)

where  is an arbitrary constant. the adhm moduli space is then identied with the space of
as subject to (2.4) modulo the action of an o(k) symmetry which acts on the instanton indices
of the variables as follows

w   w u ,

a
   ua

 u t , u  o(k).

(2.5)

since there are 3k(k  1)/2 constraints (2.4) and o(k) has dimension k(k  1)/2 the dimension
of the adhm moduli space is 4k(n + 1).

3

the nal piece of the story is the explicit construction of the self-dual gauge eld itself. to

this end, we dene the matrix

(x) =(cid:18)

 (cid:19) ,

w 

x 1[k][k] + a

(2.6)

where x , or equivalently xn, is a point in spacetime. for generic x, the (2n + 2k)  2n
dimensional complex-valued matrix u(x) is a basis for ker( ):

u = 0 = u  ,

where u is orthonormalized according to

u u = 1[2n][2n] .

the self-dual gauge eld is then simply

vn = u nu .

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

it is straightforward to show that vn is anti-hermitian and satises vn = j(vn)t j and so is
valued in the lie algebra of sp(n).

the fermions in the background of the instanton lead to new grassmann collective coor-
dinates. associated to the fermions in the adjoint and anti-symmetric tensor representations,
a, these collective coordinates are described by the (2n + 2k)  k matrices ma, and their
conjugates

ma =(cid:18) a
(cid:19) ,
ma
where a are 2n  k matrices and ma
 are weyl-spinor-valued k  k matrices. the conjugates
are dened by

ma =(cid:0)a ma(cid:1) ,

(2.10)

and the constraint ma

 = ma

a  (a) ,
 is imposed.

ma  (ma

 ) ,

(2.11)

up till now the construction of the fermions is valid for the gauge group su(2n). for

sp(n) all we need do is impose the additional conditions

a = (1)a+1(a)t j ,

(ma

 )t = (1)a+1ma
 .

(2.12)

so, for instance, the matrices ma
 are symmetric, for the vector representation, and anti-
symmetric, for the anti-symmetric tensor representation. these symmetry properties can be

4

deduced from the adhm tensor product construction in [26]. notice that the dierent condi-
tions on the collective coordinates breaks the su(4) symmetry of the mock n = 4 notation to
su(2)u(1), the true r-symmetry of the n = 2 theory. these fermionic collective coordinates
are subject to analogues of the adhm constraints (2.4):

a
  w a + aw  + [ma, a

 ] = 0 .

(2.13)

one can check that there are consequently 2k(n + 1) and 2k(n  1) fermionic collective
coordinates corresponding to a for the vector and anti-symmetric tensor representations, re-
spectively. this is in accord with the index theorem that counts the zero eigenvalue solutions
to the dirac equation in the background of the instanton. the quantities

a
 = k1trk ma
 ,

 a = k1trk w a ,

(2.14)

in the vector multiplet, a = 1, 3, are the collective coordinates corresponding to the four
supersymmetric and four superconformal zero modes.

finally we have the fundamental hypermultiplets. they contribute additional fermionic
collective coordinates which can be described by a 2n  8 dimensional matrix k. these
variables are not subject to any additional adhm-type constraints. there are no additional
bosonic collective coordinates associated to any of the scalar elds in the theory.

at lowest order in g, the instanton action, which is the pull-back of the action to the

instanton solution, is

sk

inst =

82k
g2 + sk

quad ,

(2.15)

where sk
quad is a certain four-fermion interaction which is induced from the yukawa interactions
of the theory via tree-level scalar exchange. this is where the n = 4 labelling comes in
handy: the interaction induced by the yukawa couplings between the vector multiplet and
anti-symmetric tensor hypermultiplet is precisely what would arise in the n = 4 theory but
with the variables restricted as in (2.12). in addition, there is a coupling between a bi-linear
in the vector fermionic variables and the hypermultiplet fermionic variables as in [27] arising
form the yukawa couplings between the vector multiplet and fundamental hypermultiplets:

2

sk

quad =

2g2 trk(cid:2)abcd mambl1 mcmd  kkt l1( m1m3  m3m1)(cid:3) .

here, l is the following operator on k  k matrices:
2{, w 0} + [a

l   = 1

n, [a

n, ]] ,

(2.16)

(2.17)

where w 0  w w . notice that the fundamental fermionic collective coordinates are only
coupled to the adjoint fermionic collective coordinates since there are no yukawa couplings
between the former and the anti-symmetric fermionic collective coordinates.

5

notice that the pattern of lifting of fermionic zero modes in the fermion quadrilinear (2.16)
leads to a selection rule on the insertions of fermion modes. suppose the insertions in a cor-
relator involve nadj adjoint, nast antisymmetric tensor and nf fundamental fermionic collective
coordinates, then for a non-trivial instanton contribution we need

nadj = nast + nf ,

(2.18)

subject to nadj  4k(n + 1), nast  4k(n  1) and nf  8k. in particular, since the action does
not lift the 8 exact supersymmetric and superconformal zero-modes we have nadj  8.

later we shall nd it essential to bi-linearize this quadrilinear by introducing bosonic vari-

ables ab  ba, six k  k matrices, subject to the reality condition

ab  (ab) = 1

2 abcdcd .

we can write ab as an explicit so(6) vector a with components

1 = 2(12 + 34) , 2 = i2(12  34) , 3 = 2(14 + 23) ,
4 = i2(14 + 23) , 5 = i2(13  24) , 6 = 2(13 + 24) ,

(2.19)

(2.20)

normalized so that aa  abcdabcd. taking account the following symmetry properties
(2.21)

(kkt )t = kkt ,

( m[amb])t = (1)a+b+1 m[amb] ,
the auxiliary variables ab are subject in addition to

ab = (1)a+b+1(ab)t .

(2.22)

so a, a = 1, . . . , 4, are symmetric and a, a = 5, 6, are anti-symmetric. these conditions
obviously only respect a su(2)  u(1) subgroup of su(4), the r-symmetry of the n = 2
theory. the transformation we want is then

esk

quad = (detsl)2(detal)z d exp(cid:2)  abcdtrk ablcd + 4ig1trk abab(cid:3) ,

where detsl and detal are the determinants of l evaluated on a basis of symmetric and anti-
symmetric matrices, respectively, and we have dened the fermion bi-linear

(2.23)

ab =

1
22

mamb 

1
42

a2b4kkt .

(2.24)

the determinant factors in (2.23) are conveniently cancelled by factors that arise from integrating-
out pseudo collective coordinates corresponding to the scalars from the vector and anti-symmetric
tensor multiplets (see [3]).

6

the measure on the adhm moduli space can be deduced from [3, 10, 11] and is simply
the at cartesian measure for all the adhm variables, including the auxiliary variables ,
with the adhm constraints (2.4) and (2.13) imposed by explicit delta functions, weighted by
the exponential of the action on the right-hand side of (2.23). up to an overall normalization

where the delta functions impose the bosonic and fermionic adhm constraints (2.4) and (2.13).
as in the n = 4 case, this measure has the natural interpretation in terms of branes. first of all
the n = 2 gauge theory can be described by the low energy limit of a set of n d3-branes moving
tangent to of one of the four orientifold o7-planes [28,29] in the type iib orientifold of sen [30].
in this construction there are four d7-branes on top of each of the o7-planes. the gauge theory
on the world volume of the d3-branes is precisely our n = 2 supersymmetric sp(n) gauge
theory, with an anti-symmetric tensor hypermultiplet and four fundamental hypermultiplets.
the latter elds arise from strings stretched between the d3- and the four d7-branes.

now on top of this construction we include k d-instantons. the matrix theory on the world
volume of the d-instantons will reproduce the adhm construction and measure described
above. in order to see this, it is useful to start from d instantons is at ten-dimensional space
which are described by the dimensional reduction of n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory in ten
dimensions. the lorentz group in ten-dimensional euclidean space is broken to h = so(4)1 
so(4)2  so(2)  so(10), where the rst factor corresponds to the directions along the d3-
brane world-volume, the second factor to the directions in the d7/o7 world-volume orthogonal
to the d3-branes and nally the last factor corresponds to the two directions orthogonal to the
d7/o7 world volume. the components of ten-dimensional gauge eld decompose as

10  (4, 1, 1)s  (1, 4, 1)s  (1, 1, 2)a

(2.26)

corresponding in the adhm construction to a
n, a, a = 1, . . . , 4 and a, a = 5, 6, respectively.
the superscripts in (2.26) label the projections on the u(2n) valued variables imposed in the
orientifold background, where s means symmetric and a means anti-symmetric.

in order to describe the fermions we consider the covering group of h, h = su(2)l1 
su(2)r1su(2)l2su(2)r2u(1). the majorana-weyl fermion of the ten-dimensional theory
decomposes as

16  (2, 1, 2, 1)s

1  (2, 1, 1, 2)a

1  (1, 2, 2, 1)s

1  (1, 2, 1, 2)a

1

(2.27)

under h. again the superscripts indicate the projection imposed by the orientifold background.
the rst two components are identied with the adhm variables ma
 , for a = 1, 3 and 2, 4,

7

respectively, and the latter two with some additional variables  
a whose role will emerge shortly.
notice that the subgroup su(2)l2  u(1)  h is identied with the r-symmetry of the original
n = 2 gauge theory.

the remaining adhm variables correspond to the presence of the d3- and d7-branes. for
instance w  and a are associated to strings stretched between the d-instantons and the d3-
branes and nally the variables k are associated to strings stretched between the d-instantons
and d7-branes (there are no bosonic variables associated to these strings). we shall not write
down the full action for this theory, but it is a simple generalization to include k of that for
the n = 4 theory written down in [3]. however, as explained in [3] it is useful to introduce
additional bosonic auxiliary k  k matrices d 
transforming in a triplet of su(2)r1, and in the
present context anti-symmetric, whose signicance will emerge shortly. now in the decoupling
limit   0, the coupling constant of the d-instanton world volume matrix theory goes to
innity which eectively removes certain terms from the action. it is straightforward to show
that the remaining action is precisely that on the right-hand side of (2.25) and the variables d 

and  
a act as lagrange multipliers that impose the bosonic and fermionic adhm constraints
(2.4) and (2.13), respectively.



3. the large-n measure

we now want to take nd an approximation of the adhm measure valid in the large n-limit.
the procedure is by now well documented [3, 16, 17].

first of all it is advantageous to write the measure in terms of a set of gauge invariant

variables dened in terms of a 2k  2k dimensional matrix

 = w w  .
from this we dene the following four k  k matrices

w 

w 0 = w w  ,

w c = ( c)


 w w  .

(3.1)

(3.2)

the matrix w 0 is symmetric while the three matrices w c are anti-symmetric. we now change
variables from w  to the gauge invariant variables above and the gauge transformations acting
on the solution which parameterize a coset. since the measure is used to integrate gauge
invariant quantities we integrate over the gauge coset which yields a volume factor. up to
numerical factors2 and for n  k we have

zcoset

dw z (det2kw )n k2/2+1/4 dw 0 yc=1,2,3

dw c .

(3.3)

2for later use, the numerical pre-factor goes like n 2kn +k2

k/2 at large n .

8

in terms of the gauge invariant coordinates the adhm constraints (2.4) are linear:

w c = ic

nm[a

n, a

m] ,

(3.4)

where c

nm is a t hooft eta-symbol dened in [3], and hence can be trivially integrated out.

on the fermionic side we need to integrate out the superpartners of the gauge degrees-of-

freedom. to isolate these variables we expand

a = w  a + w  a + a ,

(3.5)

where the a modesthe ones we need to integrate outform a basis for the kernel of w ,
i.e. w a = 0, the remaining variables are chosen to have the symmetry properties

( a)t = (1)a+1 a ,

( a)t = (1)a a .

(3.6)

notice that the a variables decouple from the fermionic adhm constraints (2.13). the change
of variables from a to { a, a, a} involves a jacobian:
da =z (det2kw )2k ya=1,2,3,4

z ya=1,2,3,4
da exp(cid:2)8ig1trk ab ab(cid:3) = 26k(n k)(/g)4k(n k) (det4k)n k .

we can now integrate out the a variables:

z ya=1,2,3,4

d a da da .

furthermore, the fermionic adhm constraints (2.13) can then be used to integrate-out the
variables  a. the resulting expression is rather cumbersome and is, in any case, not needed
at this stage. fortunately, in the large n limit it simplies considerably.

(3.7)

(3.8)

we now proceed to take a large-n limit of the measure using a steepest descent method.

as explained in [3] it is useful to scale ab  nab because this exposes the three terms

which contribute to the large-n saddle-point action:

the rst and second terms come from (3.3) and (3.8) while the nal term comes from (2.25).

se =  log det2kw  log det4k + trk ala .

(3.9)

we can now perform a steepest descent approximation of the measure which involves nding
n. the resulting

the minima of the eective action with respect to the variables ab, w 0 and a
saddle-point equations are3

abcd (l  ab) ce = 1
aa = 1

e 1[k][k] ,

2 d
2 (w 1)0 ,
nm[a

[a, [a, a

n]] = ic

m, (w 1)c] .

(3.10)

3as usual we shall frequently swap between the two representations a and ab for so(6) vectors.

9

where we have introduced the matrices

(w 1)0 = tr2 w 1,

(w 1)c = tr2  cw 1 .

(3.11)

we note that the expression for the eective action (3.9) and the saddle point equations
(3.10) look identical to those derived in [3] for the n = 4 theory, however, the dierence is the
n, w 0, a} which will have to be taken into account.
symmetry properties of the variables {a
as in the n = 4 case we look for a solution with w c = 0, c = 1, 2, 3, which means that the
instantons are embedded in mutually commuting su(2) subgroups of the gauge group. in this
case equations (3.10) are equivalent to

[a

n, a

m] = [a

n, a] = [a, b] = 0 , w 0 = 1

2(aa)1 .

(3.12)

the nal equation can be viewed as giving the value of w 0, whose eigenvalues are the instanton
sizes at the saddle-point. clearly aa and w 0 must be non-degenerate.

the solution space to these equations (up to the auxiliary o(k) symmetry) is composed of

distinct branches. on the rst branch

a =(diag(cid:0)1

for even instanton number 2k and is, in block form,

where a is a unit six-vector. notice that the sign of i
transformation  1. so physically i
are the position of the individual instantons in r4 and i are their scale sizes.

a, a = 5, 6, can be reversed by an o(2k)
a is coordinate on the orbifold s5/z2. in these solutions x i
n

the rst branch can be interpreted as parameterizing, via {x i

a}, the position of k
objects, the d-instantons, moving in ads5s3, where the s3 is precisely the orbifold singularity
of s5/z2 of the dual type iib superstring background. since these instantons are conned to
the singularity they are fractional [3133]. the second branch describes how the fractional
d-instantons conned to the singularity on the rst branch can move o in pairs to explore
the whole of s5/z2 parametrized by i
a. of course there are also mixed branches consisting

n, i, i

10

of fractional instantons on, and normal instanton o, the singularity. however, we shall not
need these more general solutions in our analysis.

in principle, in order to do a saddle-point analysis we have to expand the eective action
around these general solutions to sucient order to ensure that the uctuation integrals con-
verge.
in general because the gaussian form has zeros whenever two d-instantons coincide
one has to go to quartic order in the uctuations. fortunately, as explained in [3], we do
not need to expand about these most general solution to the saddle-point equations to quar-
tic order since this is equivalent to expanding to the same order around the most degenerate
solution where all the d-instantons are at the same point. the resulting quartic action has
at directions corresponding to the relative positions of the d-instantons. however, when the
fermionic integrals are taken into account the integrals over these relative positions turn out
to be convergent and hence these degrees-of-freedom should be viewed as uctuations around
rather than facets of the maximally degenerate solution. the variables left un-integrated, since
they are not convergent, are the centre-of-mass coordinates. in the present situation, as in the
orbifold theories [17], there is an important further implication: the number of centre-of-mass
coordinates (corresponding to the non-damped integrals) can depend on exactly what fermionic
insertions are made into measure since this aects the convergence properties of the bosonic
integrals. we will see that this is closely connected with the dierent branches of the solution
space.

for the rst branch of solutions, the maximally degenerate solution is (3.13) with all the

instantons at the same point:

a
n = xn1[k][k] ,
a =(1 a1[k][k] a = 1, . . . , 4 ,

a = 5, 6 .

0

(3.15)

for the second branch with instanton number 2k, the maximally degenerate solution is (3.14)
with all the instantons at the same point:

a
n = xn1[2k][2k] ,
a = 1 a1[k][k] (1[2][2] a = 1, . . . , 4 ,

a = 5, 6 .

 2

(3.16)

in (3.15) a parametrizes s3, whereas in (3.16), a parametrizes s5/z2.

the expansion of the eective action to quartic order around these solution can be deduced
from the analysis of [3], although the rst case describing the fractional d-instantons is some-
what simpler and we describe it rst. after integrating-out the uctuations in the variables
w 0 which are lifted at gaussian order, as in [3], the quartic uctuations are governed by the

11

action which looks identical to the action of ten-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric u(k) gauge
theory dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions:

sb = 

1
2

where the gauge eld has components

trk(cid:2)a, a(cid:3)2 ,

however, the components of the gauge eld are subject to

a = n 1/4(cid:0)1a

n, a(cid:1) .

(3.17)

(3.18)

(a)t = a ,

for  = 1, . . . , 8 ,

(a)t = a ,

for  = 9, 10 .

(3.19)

in other words, the matrix model only has o(k)  u(k) symmetry. the centre-of-mass param-
eters of the maximally degenerate solution, xn and 1 a, correspond to the trace parts of a,
 = 1, . . . , 8, and these decouple from the action.

now we turn to the fermionic sector which are coupled to the bosonic variables in (2.23).
first of all we fulll our promise to deal with the fermionic adhm constraints. to leading
order in 1/n, these constraints read

22a

 =  1

2 [w 0,  a

 ]  [ma, a

 ] .

(3.20)

so the integrals over the  a variables soak up the delta-functions imposing the fermionic
adhm constraints, as promised. in (3.20), w 0 are the uctuations in w 0, all of which are
lifted at gaussian order. due to a cross term we can eectively replace w 0 with 43   at
leading order (see [3]). collecting all the leading order terms, the fermion couplings are

sf = i(cid:16) 82n

 and  a can be amassed into two so(8) spinors  and :

we also dene rescaled fundamental collective coordinates

in terms of the new variables, the fermion couplings can be written in an elegant way as

sf = i trk(cid:0)[a, ] + [a9  ia10, ] + [a9 + ia10, ]  (a9 + ia10)kkt(cid:1) ,

with the appropriate so(8) inner products between the spinors. here ,  = 1, . . . , 8 is a
representation of the d = 8 cliord algebra which depends upon .4

(3.25)

the couplings (3.25) do not involve the trace parts of  corresponding to the eight super-
symmetric and superconformal zero-modes of the instanton, which we denoted previously as
a
 and  a, for a = 1, 3. separating out the integrals over these variables and the bosonic
centre-of-mass variables, the measure at large n has the form5

z dkesk

d3  ya=1,3
where zo(k) is the partition function of an o(k) matrix model:

d2a d2 a  zo(k) ,

(3.26)

zo(k) =

vol o(k)z d a d  d dk es(a,,,k) ,

(3.27)

where the hat indicates the traceless parts and s(a, , ,k) = sb + sf. this matrix model is
identical to the one written down in [21] and describes the dynamics of k d-instantons in at
space. in other words, at large n the d3-branes have disappeared explicitly in the description
of d-instanton dynamics and their only eect is to change the centre-of-mass measure from r10
to ads5  s3, along with the 8 supersymmetric and superconformal fermionic integrals which
are associated to the 8 symmetries broken by the instanton. one can show that the integrals
over all the bosonic variables in the denition of zo(k) are actually convergent so that zo(k) is
some nite numerical factor (this is important for getting the n counting of the answer correct).

now we turn to the expansion around the maximally degenerate solution for the second
branch of solutions (3.14) with instanton number 2k. in this case the solution is not proportional
to the identity and many of the uctuations, those which do not commute a, for a = 5, 6,
are lifted at gaussian order. in fact it is not dicult to see that the resulting leading order
term can be deduced from the o(2k) matrix model constructed above by expanding around
a = 1 a1[k][k]   2, a = 5, 6. the solution only commutes with a subgroup u(k)  o(2k),

4the construction of this cliord algebra can be deduced from the similar construction in d = 10 for the

n = 4 theory in [3].

5we have kept track of power of n and g but not other numerical factors.

13

and so the resulting model only has u(k) symmetry. after a suitable gauge xing (described in
the context of the orbifold models in [17]) and after integrating-out the gaussian uctuations,
which include all the fundamental collective coordinates k, one is left with the partition function
of a u(k) matrix model which is identical to that which appears in the n = 4 calculation
namely ten-dimensional n = 1 gauge theory dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions. the
u(k) gauge eld a

 is embedded in the o(2k) model variables a as

a = a

 (1[2][2]  = 1, . . . , 8 ,

 = 9, 10 .

the 16 fermions  and  combine into the 16 component majorana weyl fermion of the
ten-dimensional theory. the trace parts of the gauge eld a
 separate out to give an integral
over ads5  s5/z2 along with 16 fermionic integrals which include the 8 supersymmetric and
superconformal zero modes along with the 8 components of  proportional to 1[k][k] 2, which
for conformity of notation we denote a
z d2k
which is identical to the measure in the n = 4 case. again, it is important that bosonic
integrals in the denition of the partition function zsu(k) are all convergent and this factor is
some overall numerical factor. our analysis makes it clear that the second branch is actually
contained within the more general rst branch. the key point is that the convergence of
the integrals of the bosonic variables in the o(2k) matrix model depends on the fermionic
context, i.e. on what fermion insertions are made into the partition function. the second
 and  a, a = 2, 4, into the o(2k) partition
branch corresponds to inserting the 8 modes a
function. the integrals over the components of a, for  = 9, 10, proportional to 1[k][k]   2,
are not damped after taking into account the now smaller number of fermionic integrals. these
divergent integrals need to be separated out as additional centre-of-mass coordinates leading
to an integral over s5/z2 rather than s3.

i would like to thank michael gutperle for very helpful conversations.

note: near the completion of this work there appeared a paper by gava et al. [22]. that
paper has identical conclusions to the present work but goes much further and provides a very

14

detailed comparison between instanton contributions to certain correlators in the gauge theory
and the string theory. the results are in perfect agreement with the ads/cft correspondence.
