(february 16, 2014)

the quantum eld theory of extended objects is employed to address the hitherto nonrenormal-
izable pauli interaction. this is achieved by quantizing the dirac eld using the innite dimensional
generalization of the extended object formulation following which the order  contribution to the
anomalous magnetic moment of the electron (and of the muon) arising from the pauli term is
calculated.

i. introduction

the quantum mechanics of extended objects [1] and its innite dimensional generalization, namely, the quantum
eld theory of extended objects, in particular 6 scalar eld theory have been presented by the author [2]. the
quantum eld theory of extended objects is obtained by constructing the lorentz invariant generalization to elds of
the noncanonical commutation relations

(cid:2)xf , p(cid:3) = iep 2/m2

g

(1.1)

where xf is the noncommuting fuzzy 4-position operator, p is the euclidean 4-momentum, and g = (1, 1, 1, 1) is
the euclidean metric. the commutation relations in eq. (1.1) have a smooth limit with ordinary quantum mechanics
as the compton wavelength 1
m of the particle vanishes. we choose to construct the eld theory in euclidean space for
convenience. as we shall demonstrate the minkowski space propagation amplitude can be recovered by the variable
transformation p0  ip0. this is not a rotation of the contour in the sense of the wick rotation since the contour
does not close in this case. such a transformation ensures that the preservation of the four dimensional rotational
symmetry of euclidean space will also preserve lorentz invariance. after quantizing the dirac eld we study quantum
electrodynamics with the pauli term. the order  contribution to the magnetic moment of the electron (and of the
muon) arising from the hitherto nonrenormalizable correction term is calculated.

ii. the dirac field

the euclidean space lagrangian for the free dirac eld can be written as

the dirac eld is usually quantized by imposing the anticommutation relations

l = (i/ + m) = (i + m).

a (x), (3)

b

n(3)

(y)o = (3)(x  y)ab

where (3)(x) is expanded as a sum over 3-momenta:

(3)(x) = z

d3p
(2)3

1

p2ep xs

(as

pus(p)eipx + bs

pvs(p)eipx)

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

and similarly for (3)(x) = (3)(x)0. here a and b are the annihilation operators for particles and antiparticles
obeying the anticommutation relations

the spinor contraction relations in euclidean space are given by

p, as
(cid:8)ar

q (cid:9) = (cid:8)ar

p, as

q (cid:9) = (2)3(3)(p  q).

(2.4)

1

xs

xs

us(p)us(p) =   p  m

and

vs(p)vs(p) =   p + m.

the retarded dirac eld propagation amplitude can be computed from the above expansions and is given by

sab

r (x  y) = (x0  y0)h0|n(3)
(/p  m)
p2 + m2 eip(xy)

d4p
(2)4

a (x), 

= z

(3)

b(y)o|0i

(2.5)

(2.6)

where the anticommutator is employed in order to ensure that the vacuum has only positive-energy excitations. the
same propagation amplitude can be obtained by expanding the eld as a sum over 4-momenta:

(x) = z

d4p
(2)4

1

pp2 + m2 xs

the eld expansion for (x) coupled with the euclidean spinor eld anticommutation relations:

(as

pus(p)eipx + bs

pvs(p)eipx).

na(p), 

b (q)o = i4(p  q)ab

(2.7)

(2.8)

which are lorentz invariant generalizations of the commutation relations arising from ordinary (spacetime) quantum
mechanics (zero compton wavelength limit of eq.(1.1)) leads to

sab
r (x  y) = h0|(x)(y)|0i

= z

d4p
(2)4

(/p  m)
p2 + m2 eip(xy)

(2.9)

which is the dirac eld propagation amplitude. we observe that by changing p  p the right hand side of eq.(2.9)
is symmetric under x  y implying that (cid:2)a(x), b(y)(cid:3) = 0. the vanishing of the commutator can be explained by
noting that (x) is a eld which creates and destroys states characterized by relativistically invariant 4-momenta (or
mass when on shell). thus, the measurement of a eld which creates and destroys such states at one spacetime point
cannot aect its measurement at another spacetime point. we note that (x) is not the usual 3-momentum expansion
of the dirac eld (denoted by (3)(x)). from eq. (2.6) and eq. (2.9) it follows that

h0|(x)(y)|0i = (x0  y0)h0|n(3)

a (x), 

(3)

b(y)o|0i.

(2.10)

the anticommutator on the right hand side vanishes for spacelike separations and it is well known that the ordinary
dirac eld preserves causality. this is not surprising since (as shown above) the propagator can also be obtained by a
lorentz invariant generalization of a causal structure, namely, ordinary (spacetime) quantum mechanics. the reason
this approach is not employed in the quantum eld theory of point particles is because the existence of point particle
mass states violates the statement of causality [2].

in order to characterize the intermediate states in a nonrenormalizable theory we generalize the noncanonical

commutation relations arising from the extended object formulation:

na(p), 

b(q)o = iep2/m2

4(p  q)ab

(2.11)

where, once again, the anticommutator is employed in order to ensure that the vacuum has only positive-energy
excitations. as a consequence, the propagation amplitude becomes

h0|(x)(y)|0i = z

d4p
(2)4

(/p  m)
p2 + m2 ep2/m2

eip(xy)

(2.12)

which is once again symmetric under x  y and reects the fact that relativistically invariant 4-momentum states are
being created and destroyed by the eld (x). we note that the imposition of noncanonical commutation relations
precludes the existence of 3-momentum characterizations for the particle. the author has proved this statement for

2

the scalar eld and the extension to the dirac eld is straightforward [2]. this fact coupled with the fact that we are
employing a lorentz invariant generalization of a causal structure, namely, the extended object formulation, allows
us to conclude that the statement of microscopic causality is not violated by this quantization procedure. we observe
the the euclidean momentum space propagator

s(p) =

(/p  m)
p2 + m2 ep2/m2

(2.13)

is bounded from above and below since p2 is a euclidean scalar. the ordinary dirac eld propagator (euclidean) is
recovered in the limit of vanishing compton wavelength. a crucial feature of this propagator is the gaussian damping
which eliminates the high frequency modes and renders the interacting theory nite to all orders. the minkowski
space propagation amplitude can be obtained by the variable transformation p0  ip0 which is not a rotation of the
contour in the sense of the wick rotation since the contour does not close due to the essential singularity at innity.
the corresponding dp0 integration limits go from i to i. in order to explain this feature we observe that the
spacetime commutation relations arising from the extended object formulation have a relative negative sign between
the phase space and energy-time relations. this sign diculty can be removed by using the minkowski metric but this
does not aord a lorentz invariant generalization to elds. thus, if we choose to formulate the theory in minkowski
space we have to choose our dp0 integration limits from i to i. we note that if the contour were to close this
would simply be a wick rotation as is the case in the limit of vanishing compton wavelength. in his previous paper
on 6 scalar eld theory the author has proved that unitarity is preserved in the theory up to fourth order in the
coupling constant [2]. in this paper we do not prove unitarity in the theory but appeal to the argument that since
the scalar eld propagator preserves unitarity in a nonrenormalizable theory, namely, 6 theory, its spinor extension
will also preserve unitarity in a corresponding nonrenormalizable theory, namely, quantum electrodynamics with the
pauli term. moreover, we can subject the calculated values of the order  corrections arising from the pauli term to
experimental verication.

iii. the pauli interaction

following the quantization of the dirac eld we proceed to calculate the order  correction to the magnetic moment
contribution arising from the pauli term. in minkowski space with  = (1, 1, 1, 1) the lagrangian for quantum
electrodynamics with the pauli interaction is:

l = (i/d  m) 

1
4

f f  

e
m

 f 

where d is the gauge covariant derivative

d =  + iea(x),

(3.1)

(3.2)

f = a   a is the electromagnetic eld strength tensor,  = i
2 [, ], and m is some common mass. the
last term in the lagrangian is the pauli term which is the leading nonrenormalizable correction term of dimension 5
allowed by cp, lorentz, and gauge invariance. we will now study the order  correction to electron scattering due
to the presence of a virtual photon. the vertex correction diagram is shown in gure 1 and the s-matrix element for
scattering from this eld is given by

im(2)(p

0  p0) = ieu(p)(cid:20) acl

 (p  p) +

1
m

 f cl

 (p  p)(cid:21) u(p)

(3.3)

which contains the sum of two contributions. the rst contribution is the conventional vertex correction arising due
to the interaction

hint = z d3xeacl
 j
where j(x) = (x)(x) is the electromagnetic current and acl
is the vertex correction arising due to the pauli interaction

 is a xed classical potential. the second contribution

(3.4)

hint = z d3x

e

 j

(3.5)

 =  (cid:2)1 + g(q2)(cid:3)

u(0)(cid:2)i, j(cid:3) u(0) = 2ik
u(0)(cid:2)i, 0(cid:3) u(0) = 0

and

(3.8)

(3.9)

where j(x) = (x) (x) is the pauli tensor current and f cl
 is a xed classical eld. the rst contribution
leads to the well known anomalous magnetic moment rst calculated by schwinger in 1948 [3]. the lande g-factor is
corrected (at order ) by an amount

ae =

g  2

2

=


2  0.0011614

(3.6)

whereas the experimental value is ae = 0.001159652209(31) where the estimated errors are in parentheses [4]. since
the time the calculation was originally performed by schwinger, the calculation has been carried to order 3 (where
there are 72 feynman diagrams). the theoretical value to this order is given by: [5]

ae = 0.5(cid:16) 

(cid:17)2
(cid:17)  0.32848(cid:16)

(cid:17)3
+ 1.49(cid:16) 

+ . . .

(3.7)

which leads to ae = 0.001159652411(66) where once again the estimated errors are in parentheses.

in order to study the order  correction due to the pauli term (where the point particle approximation has to be
relaxed) we need to evaluate the feynman diagram shown in figure 1. we can restrict the form of  considerably
by appealing to lorentz invariance. since  transforms as a tensor it must be proportional to  which is the only
tensor available. therefore, we have

where g(q2) is a form factor. to lowest order g = 0 and  =  . by evaluating the vertex correction due to the
pauli term using the relations

and retaining terms up to rst order in small momenta we observe that the pauli term contributes an amount of order
4e
m to the magnetic moment of the electron. the calculated value of the magnetic moment of the electron agrees with
experiment to within terms of order 1010e/2me so m must be greater than about 8  1010me = 4  107 gev [6].
applying the feynman rules to the diagram in gure 1 we nd, to order  that

(p, p) = z

(3.10)

(3.11)

where  =  +  and k = k + q. we note that since we are dealing with retarded propagators the feynman
prescription for treating the poles is not employed. by using the contraction identities

 = 2

 = 4g
 = 

we can reduce eq. (3.10) to

 (p, p) = 2ie2

(2)4 u(p)(2kk + m2) u(p)

(k  p)2)

ek2/m2
k2 + m2

ek2/m2
k2 + m2 .

employing the method of feynman parameters we can express the denominator as

(k  p)2
where the new denominator d is

k2  m2 = z 1

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

by shifting k to l = k + yq  zp we obtain

d = l2 + 

where

consequently, we obtain a simplied expression for :

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)

as noted before the dl0 integration limits go from i to i since we have employed the noncanonical quantization
procedure to obtain the propagator. we can switch to euclidean momenta by means of the variable transformation
l0  il0 upon which we obtain the form factor g(q2) as

g(q2) =

.

(3.20)

(3.21)

(3.22)

where the momenta are now euclidean. for a slowly varying electromagnetic eld we can take the limit q  0 in the
spinor matrix element and we obtain

g(q2 = 0) =

(3.23)

where we have increased the power of the momentum in the integrand by a factor of two in order to maintain the
dimensionality of the graph. this is due to the negative dimensional (mass dimension = -1) coupling constant. in
order to get an estimate of the value of g(0) we can numerically compute the value of the integral at zeroth order in
p. if we choose the greatest lower bound for m at 4  107 gev, then the bound obtained for g(0) is

g(0) < 2.510402  1026

(3.24)

this bound represents the order  correction to the lande g-factor of the electron arising from the pauli term. the
value of the order  correction is extremely small because of the smallness of the electron mass and the large bound
on m . the limit on m can be weakened if other symmetries restrict the form of the nonrenormalizable interactions.
we observe that the full lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics is invariant under the symmetry   5 (chiral
transformation) and m  m. if we impose this symmetry, the pauli term would have to appear in the lagrangian
with an extra factor m/m , so that its contribution to the magnetic moment would be only of order 4em/m 2. because
of the extra factor of m, here it is the muon rather than the electron that provides the most useful limit on m .
the calculated value agrees with experiment to within terms of order 108e/2me, so m must be greater than about

8  108m = 3  103 gev [6]. using this value of m and m = 106 mev we obtain the bound on the order 

correction (at zeroth order in p) to the lande g-factor arising from the pauli term (of the muon) as

g(0) < 7.53197  1022.

iv. conclusion

(3.25)

by quantizing the dirac eld using the quantum eld theory of extended objects we are able to calculate the order
 correction to the anomalous magnetic moment contribution arising from the pauli term. the calculated values of
the order  corrections arising from the pauli term need to be subjected to experimental verication.
