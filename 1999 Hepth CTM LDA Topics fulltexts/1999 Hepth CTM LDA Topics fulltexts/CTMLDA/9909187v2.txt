1 introduction

constant eld strengths were studied as solutions to u(n) yang-mills on
t 4 fteen years ago in an attempt to get a handle on the mechanism of
connement [1]. the spectrum of uctuations around the background eld
conguration was explicitly determined by van baal in terms of theta func-
tions on the four torus [2]. these results were later used in the context of
string theory in, amongst others ([3]), [4] to compare the spectrum of open
strings ending on d-branes to the predictions from yang-mills theory and
the non-abelian dirac-born-infeld action. the number of massless torons
also played a crucial role in the black hole entropy counting in [5].

we extend the analysis of van baal to u(n) yang-mills solutions with
constant and diagonal eld strength on general even dimensional tori. we will
show how this analysis applies to the low-energy eective action for d-branes
in a at background and with small eld strengths. specically, the results
are relevant for higher dimensional d-branes wrapped on even dimensional
tori, e.g. d6-branes wrapped around a six torus. in the yang-mills theory,
we derive the conditions on the eld strengths to have a stable conguration.
we examine the criterion to have massless bosonic modes and give explicitly
the full set of uctuations in terms of theta functions on higher tori.
in
the dimensionally reduced sym theory relevant to d-branes the spectrum
of fermionic uctuations on t 2n can also be determined and index theory is
used to check the number of fermionic massless modes.

the article starts out with dimensionally reducing d = 9 + 1 n = 1
u(n) yang mills to the low-energy non-relativistic d-brane action. we
delimit the gauge eld backgrounds we will study. next, we compactify the
theory on an even dimensional torus and concentrate on the dependence of
the uctuations on the internal coordinates. here we extend the analysis of
van baal straightforwardly to higher tori. moreover we derive the spectrum
of scalar and fermionic uctuations in the given background and discuss the
zeromodes of the congurations in detail. finally, we situate some of the
applications in string theory in the context of our systematic analysis and
indicate new applications.

2 reduced action

van baal studied a constant diagonal eld strength conguration for u(n)
yang-mills on a four torus [2]. we will later look at u(n) yang-mills on a
general even dimensional torus, but we will rst show how this ts in the
yang-mills approximation to d-brane actions. we will closely follow the
analysis and notation of [2] and [5] in the next few sections. the bosonic
part of the d = 9 + 1 n = 1 u(n) yang mills action can be written in terms
of the ten dimensional eld strength g ( = 0, . . . , 9),

g = b  b + i[b, b]

as

s9+1 = 

1

4 z d10x t r g2

.

reduced to p + 1 dimensions the action becomes ( = 0, . . . , p and m =
p + 1, . . . , 9):

sp+1 = 

1

4 z dp+1x t r (cid:16)g2

  [m, n]2 + 2(m + i[b, m])2(cid:17) (1)

where all elds depend only on the coordinates x and the scalars and gauge
elds are :

m = bm(x)
b = b(x).

the dimensionally reduced gauge transformations read:

b  b1  i1
  m1,

with   u(n).

3 background and uctuations

in this section we determine the action for the uctuations around a general
diagonal and constant background eld strength g0. we x notations as

follows:

b = b0
g0
 = b0
d =  + i[b0
g = g0
 + f
f = da  da + i[a, a]

, b0
]

(4)

where the gauge eld uctuations are denoted a, with corresponding eld
strength f , and we have dened a background covariant derivative d. we
choose the background gauge xing condition da = 0. when the back-
ground gauge eld and eld strength are diagonal and constant (solving the
classical equations of motion), we nd the following action for the uctua-
tions:

1

s =

2 + 2ad2a  4ia[g0

4 z dp+1xt r(g0
2md2m + 2i(da  da)[a, a] + 4imd[m, a]
[a, a]2  2[a, m]2  [m, n]2

, a]

(5)

it will be convenient to expand the uctuations in a lie algebra basis for
u(n), namely, (ti)ab = iaib and (eij)ab = iajb for i 6= j:

a = ai
m = ci

ti + bij
mti + dij

 eij
meij

(6)

from the reality properties of the gauge elds and the scalars we nd that a
and c are real, and that bij

m = djim are complex.

4 compactication

now we will focus on our main interest. consider 2n spatial dimensions of
the d-brane to be wrapped on a torus of dimension 2n with radii r  = l 
2 ,
where (  = 1, . . . , 2n). in what follows, we only consider non-trivial eld
strengths in these directions. magnetic ux quantization1 and the fact that

1we restrict to congurations where the branes are wrapped only once around, for
example, the odd cycles. generalizing this to wrapping more than once these cycles
changes the quantization condition. see for instance [4] [5].

the background eld strength is diagonal implies then that we can write our
background in terms of the integers ni

 :

g0

ni
 
l l 

ti.

we can choose the background gauge eld to be:

b0
 = 

 x 
ni
l l 

ti.

(7)

(8)

next, we substitute this form of the background into the action (5) and
concentrate on the terms quadratic in the uctuations. since we will analyse
the spectrum of small uctuations around the background, we neglect the
interactions between the uctuations from now on. the quadratic action is:

1

where we have dened j, a measure for the dierence in eld strength in
sector i and j (on brane i and brane j), and the mass operators m0 and mij:

5 the mass operators on t 2n

from now on we will concentrate on the dependence of the uctuations on
the coordinates of the torus, the internal coordinates x. specically, we
consider the problem of diagonalizing the mass operators as operators on
t 2n. as usual, this gives information on the spectrum of modes living in
the non-compact space. the quadratic action (9) can be analysed in each
sector ij separately. in the following we will leave out the indices i and j to

5

simplify notation. we note that the analysis of the bosonic uctuations in
the following sections is valid for general n.

it will turn out that the mass operator (10) can be written in a simple
form. transforming coordinates with an element of o(2n), we can bring the
dierence in eld strengths in sector ij in the standard form :

where f1  f2  . . .  fn  0.

next, we introduce a complex structure on the torus as follows:

z = (z1, z2, . . . , zn) =

(x1  ix2, . . . , x2n1  ix2n)

a = (az1, az2, . . . , azn)

further, we dene the positive hermitian form h,

h(z, w) = 2 (z1f1 w1 + . . . + znfn wn)

= whz

h = 2 diag(f1, . . . , fn),

before we can diagonalize the mass operator, it is crucial to discuss the
boundary conditions the eigenfunctions have to satisfy. they encode the
topological data of the background gauge eld.

(20)

after the preliminary work of writing the non-trivial mass operator m in a
harmonic oscillator form in terms of complex coordinates (16), and discussing
the boundary conditions the uctuations have to satisfy (20), we determine
the spectrum and the eigenfunctions. we only discuss in detail the non-
trivial case of o-diagonal modes. moreover, the dierence between gauge
eld o-diagonal modes and scalar o-diagonal modes is a mere constant in
the eigenvalues, so we can treat them in one go. we follow the analysis of [2]
and [5]. (see [6] for an early mathematical treatment.) the ground state 0

(22)

the dierential equation is immediately solved in terms of the hermitian
form h (13) and a general holomorphic function f ,

0(z) = e 

2 h(z,z)f (z),

(23)

but the treatment of the boundary conditions is more involved. the bound-
ary condition for the uctuation 0 implies a non-trivial boundary condition
for the holomorphic function f (z). it will be convenient to introduce some
extra machinery to write these boundary conditions in terms of objects well-
known in the mathematical literature [7] on theta functions [2]. in terms of
the hermitian form h(z, w), we dene an antisymmetric form e(z, w):

h(z(x), w(y)) = x(j 2)

(h(z, w)  h(w, z))

e(z, w) = im h(z, w) =

.

we introduce the notation

q = (q1, . . . , qn) 

1
2

(m1l1  im2l2,

. . . , m2n1l2n1  im2nl2n),

to write the second degree bicharacter (q) in the simple form:

(24)

(25)

(26)

(q) = eip < 

m n   m  .

these objects make it easy to write down the boundary condition for the
uctuations  for windings around the torus for any number of times in
dierent directions:

0(z + q) = 0(z)eie(q,z)(q).

(27)

8

the boundary conditions the holomorphic function f (23) satises can then
nally be written in terms of the hermitian form h and the second degree
bicharacter :

f (z + q) = f (z)(q)eh(z,q)+ 

2 h(q,q)

(28)

now comes the pay-o for introducing the appropriate mathematical machin-
ery. these holomorphic functions f are theta functions on t 2n [7]. they span
a vectorspace of dimension |p f (n  )|. this space of theta functions is the
space of ground state uctuations around the given gauge eld background.
they can be written down explicitly and we do so in the appendix.

the higher modes are given by acting with the creation operators on the
ground state. they automatically satisfy the boundary conditions. it is clear
from (16) then that the spectrum of o-diagonal scalar eld uctuations is
given by the harmonic oscillator formula:

 = 2(

n

(2mi + 1)fi)

xi=1

(29)

and after a further trivial diagonalisation (compare (9)) for the o-diagonal
gauge elds we get the shifted spectra:

k = 2(

n

xi=1
(2mi + 1)fi  2fk)

(30)

8 summary

we summarize the spectrum and eigenfunctions for diagonal, o-diagonal
and gauge eld and scalar uctuations in the following table. we use the
notations e(zk) = 12(0, 0, . . . , 1,i, . . . , 0, 0) for the eigenvectors of j (11), v
for the volume of the torus, i, j  {1, . . . , n}; ij  {1, . . . , n(n  1)}; k 
{1, . . . , n}; p  z4; m  nn; ri  {0, . . . , ei  1}. all of these notations are
straightforward except for the components ri and ei for which we refer to
the appendix. suce it to remark that the degeneracy of the o-diagonal
uctuations is given by p f (nij

we only catalogued the case where all f ij are dierent from zero and h is

9 stability and supersymmetry

in this section we discuss stability, supersymmetry and the occurence of
massless bosonic modes in our congurations. from the general classication
we nd that there are no tachyonic modes when f2 + f3 + . . . + fn  f1 (for
all i, j). if this condition is satised, stability of the gauge eld conguration
is insured, at quadratic level. on t 4 the condition for stability implies that
the eld strength is self-dual (f1 = f2). (recall that we still have f1  f2 
. . .  fn  0). the condition for stability is much more loose when there
are more than two non-trivial eld strength components. massless modes for
the gauge elds occur when the equality f2 + f3 + . . . + fn = f1 is satised.
for higher tori they appear only in a complex combination of the gauge eld
components a1,2. on t 4, stable congurations automatically have massless
modes and they occur for the gauge eld components a1,2 and a3,4. for
higher dimensions a stable conguration does not necessarily have bosonic
massless modes.

10

turning back to our starting point, we can regard the theory we study
(for n  4) as dimensionally reduced super yang-mills theory. the super-
symmetry variation of the adjoint fermions in our background with trivial
scalars then reads:

 = f    .

(32)

it is clear that if f2 + f3 + . . . + fn = f1, the following conditions project onto
the preserved supersymmetry parameter:

 12 = 34 = . . . = 2n12n.

(33)

there are two other possibilities to preserve supersymmetry 2 when n = 4,
namely if we have f1 + f4 = f2 + f3 or if f1 = f2, f3 = f4. the following
projection conditions yield the preserved supersymmetry:

 12 = 34 = 56 = 78,

and

 12 = 34
56 = 78

(34)

(35)

respectively. these last congurations do not have any bosonic massless
modes.
in general, each projection condition halves the number of super-
symmetries. note that for the four torus the condition for stability, namely
self-duality, coincides with the condition for preservation of supersymmetry.
for higher tori this is not the case. the space of stable gauge eld congura-
tions is for higher tori much larger than the space of supersymmetric gauge
eld congurations.

10 fermionic spectrum

up till now we ignored the fermions in our reduction of super yang-mills.
in this section we determine the spectrum of the fermionic uctuations in
the theory reduced to p + 1 dimensions, compactied on t 2n, and in the

2we do not consider the case where one of the eld strenghts vanishes, although it is

easily incorporated in our framework.

11

background gauge eld conguration (17). it will turn out that the analysis
is simple once the bosonic case has been treated in detail.

the ten dimensional majorana-weyl fermions are in the adjoint repre-

sentation and can be decomposed as follows:

 = iti + klekl,

(36)

where kl = lk and k 6= l. the relevant dirac equation for the fermionic
modes is easily derived from the fermionic part of the yang-mills action
quadratic in the uctuations. as for the bosonic case, we can analyse the
spectrum of the dirac operator on t 2n to nd the mass spectrum in the
non-compact directions. to that end, we analyse the equation 3:

(in1...2n) (


i  j kl
 x

)kl = kl

(37)

we concentrate on the non-trivial o-diagonal components in sectors kl. the
standard trick to nd the spectrum of the fermionic mass operator is to square
it:

  (


i  j kl
 x

)!2

= xk {ak, ak}  2if112  . . .  2ifn2n1,2n

where we used (11). it is then easy to determine the spectrum of the fermionic
mass operator by projecting onto eigenspinors of 2k1,2k:
2(2mk + 1)fk  2f1  . . .  2fn.

(38)

 = xk

implicitly, we have made use of the fact that the o-diagonal fermions satisfy
the same boundary conditions as the bosons4. drawing on the results in the
previous sections, the eigenfunctions can then also easily be determined. re-
mark that the fermions all have a certain helicity associated to the magnetic
elds in the directions 12, 34, . . . and each component of the magnetic eld
is responsible for a zeeman splitting of the energy levels.

3 the appearance of the chirality operator is to ensure that the non-compact and the
compact part of the dirac operator commute. it does not play a crucial role in our analysis
since it doesnt change the dirac algebra [8].

4we do not want to break more supersymmetry by adding non-trivial monodromies on

top of the ones induced by the background.

12

11 zeromodes and supersymmetry

11.1 fermionic zeromodes

in this section we take a closer look at the bosonic and fermionic zeromodes
that often play a crucial role in applications. we start by describing the
fermionic zeromodes in greater detail.
it is clear from the analysis in the
previous section that only the following projected spinor has zeromodes:

kl
++...+ = (1 + i12)(1 + i34) . . . (1 + i2n12n)

kl
2n .

(39)

the signs of the projection operators reverse for sector lk, since the eld
strengths are opposite in that sector. explicitly, the dierential equations
and boundary conditions in sectors kl and lk read:

aikl
ai lk

+...+ = 0
... = 0

kl(x  + l ) = einkl



x/l kl(x )

(40)
(41)

(42)

from these equations we determine the total number of massless fermionic
modes, namely 16
 ) complex zeromodes. in certain cases, there
is a shorter route to get the number of fermionic zeromodes, via index theory.
as a preliminary, we indicate the 2n dimensional chirality of the spinors. it
is clear that:

2n pk<l p f (nkl

(1  in1 . . . 2n)kl
(1  (i)n1 . . . 2n)lk

+...+ = 0
... = 0,

(43)
(44)

such that, for n = 2k even, the zeromodes have the same chirality in the
two sectors, while for n = 2k + 1 odd, they have opposite chirality. note
that this strokes with (40), (41) and the fact that the complex conjugate
representation of the weyl representation is the original one for so(4k), and
of dierent chirality for so(4k + 2).

11.2

index theory check on number of zeromodes

using index theory, we can learn the dierence in number of massless fermi-
onic modes of positive and negative chirality. if the fermionic zeromodes all

13

have the same chirality, index theory predicts the total number of fermionic
zeromodes. we will use the index theorem for the twisted spin complex on
a at manifold for the adjoint representation [12] :

index(  (adj), d) = zm

ch(fadj)

= +  

(45)

where ch(fadj) = pj t r
is the chern class evaluated in the adjoint
representation and  is the number of positive, negative chirality zeromodes.
in the background (17) the integral is easily evaluated on t 2n:

f j
j!(2)j

adj

+   = xkl

p f (nkl

 ).

(46)

for d = 4k + 2 the sum over all sectors is zero, the contributions from
sector (kl) (strings going one way) cancelling the contribution from sector
(lk) (strings going the other way). indeed, from the analysis in the previous
section we know that the number of zeromodes of positive chirality equals the
number of zeromodes of negative chirality in this case. for d = 4k we nd,
in our conventions, only zeromodes of positive chirality, and index theory
 ) complex fermionic zeromodes in d = 4k. taking into
account the multiplicity of the zeromodes originating in ten dimensions, we
nd 16
 ) non-constant complex spinor zeromode components,
as before. this straightforwardly extends the well-known results in four
dimensions [13].

2n pk<l p f (nkl

11.3 supersymmetry and massless modes

the number of massless fermionic and massless bosonic modes diers in
supersymmetric congurations, and at rst sight it is dicult to see how
they form a representation of supersymmetry when it is partially unbroken.
nevertheless, they do. we discuss this slightly puzzling feature in this sub-
section. the unbroken supersymmetry transformations rules are given by
the dimensionally reduced formulae of n = 1 sym in ten dimensions. in
ten dimensions the formulae read:

aa

i

a = 

a

14

(47)

(48)

consider rst the case where the unbroken supersymmetry is given by

 12 = 34 = . . . = 2n12n.
starting out with a fermionic zeromode satisfying

kl
++...+ = (1 + i12)(1 + i34) . . . (1 + i2n12n)

kl
2n ,

(49)

(50)

we easily see from (47), (49) , (50) and  = m that it will never transform
into a massless scalar. that is consistent with the spectrum we found ear-
lier. when n  3, we nd only non-trivial gauge eld components in the
1 and 2 direction. for gauge eld components in the other directions, the
projection condition on the parameter  and the zeromode  make sure that
the variation vanishes. this is again consistent with what we found earlier.
it can easily be checked that on t 4 a similar analysis yields complex bosonic
zeromodes in directions 1, 2 and 3, 4. moreover for the cases where the su-
persymmetry parameter satises 12 = 34 and 56 = 78 we nd that
no bosonic zeromodes are generated, as expected. finally, it can be checked
using the formulae for the bosonic zeromodes that the transformation rule
(48) is always trivial (at the order we are working). thus, the analysis of
fermionic and bosonic zeromodes is perfectly consistent with supersymmetry,
as it should be. of course, one could perform a similar consistency check for
higher modes in the spectrum.

12 applications and conclusion

the theory we have been discussing is the low-energy theory of d-branes
in a trivial background and with only small (non-relativistic) gauge elds
excited. indeed, string theory should be seen as the high-energy completion
of the theories we studied. nevertheless, the approximation to string theory
we discussed was often used to understand results in string theory. we will
briey review some of the applications of the results that we obtained that
have already been made in the literature and that can be coherently presented
and extended in our framework.

in [4] the uctuation spectrum on t 4 in the yang-mills approximation
was compared to the string theory uctuation spectrum and the role of the
(non-abelian) dirac-born-infeld action in resolving the discrepancy was clar-
ied. the precise form of the non-abelian dirac-born-infeld action remained

15

unclear. our analysis could be useful for further studying uctuation spectra
from the dierent points of view along the lines of [4], for higher branes on
higher tori. note also that the explicit form for a tachyonic uctuation was
used in [4] to discuss tachyon condensation intuitively. that discussion is
now easily extended to higher branes.

the condition for the background gauge elds to preserve supersymmetry
is familiar in d-brane physics, especially in its t-dual form. to repeat this
well-known point, it is sucient to give an archetypical example. consider
the following conguration: a pair of d8-branes compactied on t 8 with a
constant eld strength on the rst d8-brane f12  f34  f56  f78  0.
when f12 = f34 + f56 + f78, supersymmetry is conserved. t-dualize this
conguration over directions 2, 4, 6, 8 to obtain a pair of d4-branes at angles.
the angles are given by the following formulae 5: f12 = tan 1, f34 = tan 2,
f56 = tan 3, f78 = tan 4. working at small angle, or taking into account
the modications the born-infeld action induces in the yang-mills theory in
the spirit of [4], we nd that the condition coincides with the well-known
one for rotated branes [10] [11]. note though that for the case n = 4 we
saw a physical distinction between the case where f1 = f2 + f3 + f4 and
f1 + f4 = f2 + f3. the dierence between the two cases is probably related
to the mechanism of the creation of a string in the d0-d8 system (or d4-d4
system), but we do not pursue this here.

as noted before, on higher tori, the space of stable gauge eld congura-
tions is much larger than the space of supersymmetric congurations. the
same applies therefore to all kinds of d-brane constructions in gauge theories.
the results on t 4 for the yang-mills theory were extensively discussed in for
instance [3] [4]. stability of some special congurations on t 6 and t 8 was
used in [9] to adhere zerobranes to six- and eightbranes in matrix theory. it
is now obvious that these are points in a larger parameter space of stable
congurations. note though that we only proved stability up to quadratic
order in the uctuations [9]. it may be useful to recall that for instance the
black hole with only d0- and d6-brane charge, which has a corresponding
quadratically stable representation in the gauge theory on the d6-brane, is
in fact metastable [9] [16].

another motivation for our work can be found in the following problem.
consider the only regular four dimensional supersymmetric black hole that
is solely made out of d-branes [14]. specically, dualize to the conguration

5we ignore some constant factors.

where the compact part carries d6-d2-d2-d2 brane charges. the entropy for
this black hole, calculated in supergravity, was microscopically accounted for
in [14] [15] up to a constant factor which it would be interesting to determine.
we can now easily nd supersymmetric congurations in the gauge theory
living on the d6-branes that represent such a black hole. next, we can use the
results derived in this article to calculate the dimension of the moduli space
of these congurations by counting massless states. although in principle
this program as suggested in [14] looks sound, we have as yet not been able
to make it work. finally, we indicate that the analysis of strings stretching
between branes in matrix theory is analogous (see for instance [17] ) and
we believe that our systematic treatment could be of practical use in that
context too.

to sum up, we have determined the spectrum and explicit eigenfunctions
of the uctuations around constant and diagonal eld strengths in u(n)
yang-mills on an even dimensional torus, extending earlier work [2] [5] on
t 4. we discussed supersymmetry and stability of these congurations, and
the counting of zeromodes. the analysis yields a systematic framework for
applications in string theory.

appendix: explicit eigenfunctions

to nd the explicit form of the theta functions we need some more machinery
[7]. we go to a canonical (frobenius) basis of the lattice using an sl(2n, z)
transformation:

n =

where the ei are positive integers, each ei dividing the next ei+1. we choose
a c-basis as follows:

z = z1

(n+1)

e1

+ . . . + zn

(2n)
en

(52)

where   denotes the canonical basis of the lattice. by x we denote the
real vector space generated by n+1, . . . , 2n. since imh = e (24) is zero on
x  x, we nd that h = uhu is real and symmetric. we dene then the
symmetric c-bilinear form s uniquely associated with h

and the quasi-hermitian form q

s(z, w) =  wt hz

q(z, w) = h(z, w) + s(z, w).

(53)

(54)

moreover, we need the period matrix  dened in terms of the quasi-hermitian
form q:

ij 

i

q((i), (j)).

(55)

further denitions are required, namely the bicharacter eib(q,q) with respect
to the canonical basis :

q = q  

b(q, q) =

ei qi qi+n

n

xi=1

and (q), encoding the characters m and l of :

(q) = eib(q,q)(q)

the thetafunctions are then explicitly given by:

(q) = e2ipn

i=1(mk qk+nlk

qk)

drr(z)

(z) = x0ri<|ei|
r(z) = xpz n

ei(p+e1(m+r). (p+e1(m+r))+2i(p+e1(m+r)).(z+l)

where e1|e2|e3 . . .|en and e is diagonal.
