abstract

we derive fully covariant expressions for all two-point scattering amplitudes involving
closed string tachyon and massless strings from dirichlet brane in type 0 theories. the
amplitude for two massless d-brane uctuations to produce closed string tachyon is also
evaluated. we then examine in detail these string scattering amplitudes in order to extract
world-volume couplings of the tachyon with itself and with massless elds on a d-brane.
we nd that the tachyon appears as an overall coupling function in the born-infeld action
and conjecture form of the function.

1 introduction

recent years have seem dramatic progress in the understanding of non-perturbative aspects
of string theory[1]. with these studies has come the realization that extended objects, other
than just strings, play an essential role. an important tool in these investigations has been
dirichlet brane[2]. d-branes are non-perturbative states on which open string can live, and
to which various closed string states can couple.

in perturbative type ii superstring theories, scattering amplitudes describing the in-
teraction of two massless closed string states with unexcited d-branes, and one massless
closed string with two open strings were studied extensively in [3, 4] and [5, 6], respec-
tively. perturbative spectrum of bosonic type 0 theories have the same massless states as
the bosonic part of type ii, but with the doubled set of ramond-ramond(rr) states1[7].
hence the elementary d-branes of the theory carry simultaneously two rr charges[8, 9].
one can use the same techniques as in type ii theories to evaluate various string scattering
with the d-branes in type 0 theories. most of these amplitudes are already presented in
above citations. at the massless level, scattering amplitude describing interaction of d-
brane with two dierent rr states is the only amplitude that should be evaluated. the
bosonic type 0 theories have closed string tachyon( ) in their spectrum as well[7]. there-
fore, scattering amplitudes involving this tachyon can not be address from previous work
on type ii theories either. the present paper provide calculations on these amplitudes.

the paper is organized as follows. in the following section we describe the calculations of
the scattering of two closed string tachyon, one tachyon and one closed string massless state,
and two dierent massless rr states from d-brane using conformal eld theory techniques.
the open string poles of these amplitudes are consistent with the gso projection of the
open strings attached to the the d-branes [10, 9]. in section 3 we evaluate the scattering
amplitude of one closed string tachyon and two open string states. then, in section 4 we
examine in detail these string amplitudes in order to nd the world-volume coupling of
tachyon to itself and to the massless elds on the d-branes. we nd that the tachyon
does not have world-volume coupling to rr elds. however, the couplings of tachyon
to other massless elds and to itself are consistent with an extension of the born-infeld
action. in particular, the tachyon appears as an overall coupling function in the born-infeld
action. we provide more evidence in support of this action by studying some simple string
amplitudes using the conformal eld theory with background elds. we conclude with a
brief discussion of our results in section 5.

before continuing with our calculations, let us make a comment on conventions.

in
the scattering amplitudes below, we will set 2
s =  = 2. our index conventions are that
lowercase greek indices label vector in the entire ten-dimensional spacetime, e.g., ,  =
0, 1, . . . , 9; early latin indices label vector in the world-volume, e.g., a, b, c = 0, 1, . . . , p;
middle latin indices label vector in the transverse space, e.g., i, j = p+1, . . . , 8, 9; early cap-
ital latin indices label spinor in the ten-dimensional spacetime, e.g., a, b, c = 1, 2,    32;
and middle capital latin indices label vector in u(n) gauge space, e.g., i, j = 1, 2,    , n 2.

2 two-point amplitudes

scattering amplitudes describing interaction of strings with a xed d-brane at tree level are
calculated as the string vertex operator insertions on a disk (world-sheet) with dirichlet and
neumann boundary conditions. in conformal eld theory frame, eect of these boundary
conditions appears in the world-sheet propagators. alternatively, one may use a doubling
trick to convert the propagator to the standard form of open string propagator and shift
the eect to the momentum and polarization of vertex operators[4]. hence, in order to nd
scattering amplitude of strings with d-brane, one may replace these modied momenta and
polarizations into the appropriate known scattering amplitudes of open strings[4, 5]. in
[4, 5], using this idea, the authors were able to nd various massless superstring scattering
with d-brane in type ii theory by relating them to the known amplitudes of type i theory.
however, type i theory does not have open string tachyon, so the scattering amplitudes
describing interaction of the closed string tachyon with d-branes in type 0 are not related
to amplitudes in type i theory.

in all the string scattering amplitudes appearing in this paper, we use the doubling
trick and then explicitly evaluate correlation functions and take the integrals appearing in
the amplitudes.

2.1 tachyon and tachyon amplitude

we begin by calculating the amplitude describing the scattering of two closed string tachyon
from a d-brane. it is given by the following correlation function:

a,  z d2z1d2z2 < v  (p1, z1, z1) v  (p2, z2, z2) >

where the tachyon vertex operators are

v  (p1, z1, z1) = : v0(p1, z1) :: v0(p1d, z1) :
v  (p2, z2, z2) = : v1(p2, z2) :: v1(p2d, z2) :

2

(1)

(2)

i = 1 and d

where p2
 is a diagonal matrix with values +1 on the world-volume and -
1 in the transverse space [4]. in the vertex operators, subscripts 0 and -1 refer to their
superghost charges which must be added to -2 for the disk world-sheet. here we have
also used the doubling trick to write the closed string vertex operator in terms of only
holomorphic components. the holomorphic components v0 and v1 are given by

v0(p, z) = ip(z) eipx(z)

v1(p, z) = e(z)eipx(z)

using the standard world-sheet propagators of type i theory, one can evaluate the correla-
tions in (1) and show that the integrand is sl(2,r) invariant. we refer the reader to ref. [4]
for the details of xing this symmetry and performing the integrals, and simply state the
nal result

a(,  ) = i

where t = (p1 + p2)2 = 2  2p1  p2 is the momentum transfer to the d-brane and
s = (p1apa
2) is the momentum owing parallel to the world-volume of the
brane. we also normalized (3) and subsequent amplitudes in this section by i2tp/2, the
same factor as for the massless closed string scattering amplitudes2 [4].

1) = (p2apa

from the gamma function factors in (3), we see that the amplitude contain two innite
series poles corresponding to closed and open string states in t-channel and s-channel,
respectively, with

m2

closed = 4n/

, m2

open = m/

where n, m = 0, 1, 2,   . the closed string states in the t-channel belong only to the
(ns+, ns+) sector of the theory. here one concludes that either the coupling of the
(ns, ns) states to the d-branes or to the two tachyons in the bulk is zero. from the
amplitudes in sections 2.2 and 2.4, one nds that the (ns, ns) stat es do couple with
the d-branes. hence one concludes that the coupling of two tachyons and the (ns, ns)
states is zero, e.g., coupling of three tachyons is zero in the bulk space [9]. the open strings
in the s-channel are in the ns+ sector. this is consistent with the gso projection for the
open string states on the d-brane [9]. however this amplitude does not rule out the ns
sector, because the coupling of closed string tachyon and ns states is zero, e.g., because
of the world-sheet fermions in the vertex operator of open string tachyon, the world-volume
coupling of open and closed tachyon is zero.

2.2 tachyon and ns-ns amplitudes

next, we evaluate the amplitudes describing the scattering of one tachyon and one mass-
less ns-ns(graviton, dilaton or kalb-ramond(antisymmetric tensor)) states from the d-

branes. the amplitude is given by

a,n sn s  z d2z1d2z2 < v  (p1, z1, z1)v n sn s(2, p2, z2, z2) >

where the tachyon vertex operator is given in (2) and the ns-ns vertex operator is

v n sn s(2, p2, z2, z2) = (2d) : v 

1(p2, z2) :: v 

1(p2d, z2) :

2 = 0. here 

where p2

is the polarization of ns-ns states which is traceless and symmetric

p2 = 1

(4)

for dilaton. again, we refer the reader to refs. [3, 4, 6] for the details of the calculations.
the nal result in this case is

(5)

(t/2 + 1/2)(2s)

(1/2  t/2  2s) !

where t = (p1 + p2)2 = 12p1p2. as a check of our calculations, we inserted the dilaton
polarization (4) into (5) and found that, as expected, the auxiliary vector  disappears
from the amplitude.

the t- and s-channel poles of the amplitude indicates that the mass of the closed and

open string in these channels are

m2
closed = (4n  2)/

, m2

open = m/ .

the closed strings in t-channel belong to the (ns, ns) sector. this indicates that closed
string state in this sector couple to the d-branes, e.g., the closed string tachyon couple
to the branes [9]. the poles of t-channel also indicate tha t the coupling of one tachyon,
one massless ns-ns state and any of the (ns+, ns+) states is zero in the bulk, e.g., the
coupling of two massless ns-ns and one tachyon is zero in the bulk space [9]. again the
open strings in the s-channel is con sistent with the gso projection.

2.3 tachyon and rr amplitude

type 0 theories have two set of rr states, each made of direct product of two open string
state in r sector. at the massless level, they are

type 0a :

type 0b :

(8  8+)  (8+  8) = (81 + 563) + (81 + 563)
(8  8)  (8+  8+) = (10 + 282 + 35(+)

4 ) + (10 + 282 + 35()
4 )

4

where symbols indicate the irreducible representations and the subscripts 0,1,2,3 and 4
indicate a scalar, vector, antisymmetric 2-, 3- and 4-tensor, respectively. here, the subscript
(+)(()) means that for this tensor the eld strength satises a self(anti-self)-duality
condition. the vertex operator corresponding to each of these states is also tensor product
of two open string vertex operators with an appropriate polarization tensor. scattering
amplitude of one of these states, the tachyon and d-brane is given by

a,rr  z d2z1d2z2 < v  (p1, z1, z1)v rr(2, p2, z2, z2) >

where the rr and tachyon vertex operators are

(6)

(7)

v rr(2, p2, z2, z2) = (p2(n)mp)ab : v1/2a(p2, z2) :: v1/2b(p2d, z2) :

v  (p1, z1) = : v0(p1, z1) :: v1(p1d, z1) :

.

the two dierent chiral projection operators, p, refers to the two dierent set of rr
states (c and c). here we have chosen the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts of
the tachyon vertex operator in two dierent picture in order for saturating the superghost
charge of the world-sheet. we refer the reader to ref. [4] for our conventions. in evaluating
the correlators in (6), one needs the correlation of two right-handed or left-handed spin
operators and one world-sheet fermion that is given by(see, e.g., [11])

<: sa(z1) :: sb(z2) ::  :> = 21/2()abz3/4

12

(z13z23)1/2 .

other correlators in (6) can easily be evaluated. the nal result is

(t/2)(2s)
(t/2  2s)
and an identical amplitude for a(, c). poles of this amplitude are at

tr(p2(n)mpp1)

a(, c) =

2tp
22

m2

closed = 4n/

, m2

open = m/

the t-channel poles indicate that there is no coupling between one tachyon, one massless
rr and one of the (ns, ns) states, e.g., there is no coupling between two tachyons
and one massless rr eld in the bulk space. moreover, the massless pole in this channel
is consistent with having the coupling  cc in the bulk[9]. the massless pole in s-channel
means that the tachyon couple to the open string scalar elds on the world-volume of the
d-brane.

2.4 rr and rr amplitude

the amplitudes describing the scattering of two cs or two cs with d-brane is exactly
the same as the corresponding amplitudes in type ii theories[4]. whereas, the scattering
amplitudes for c, c and d-brane is dierent and given by

ac,c  z d2z1d2z2 < v c(1, p1, z1, z1)v c(2, p2, z2, z2) >

(8)

5

where the vertex operators are given in (7). in this case, in order to calculate the amplitude
(8), one needs the correlation function between two right-handed and two left-handed spin
operators which is given by (see, e.g., [11])

< sa(z1)sb(z2)s c(z3)s d(z4) > =

1
()ab() c d(z13z14z23z24)1/4(z12z34)3/4
2
+ca ccb d(z12z34)1/4(z14z23)1/4(z13z24)5/4
ca dcb c(z12z34)1/4(z13z24)1/4(z14z23)5/4

where c is the charge conjugation matrix (see, e.g., [4]). using this correlator and per-
forming the others, one arrives at the following nal result:

a(c, c) = 

i2tp

2   1

tr(p1(n)mp)tr(p+2(m)mp)

(t/2 + 1/2)(2s)

2(m)c)

tr(p1(n)mp2(m)mp)

(t/2  1/2)(2s + 1)

(1/2  t/2  2s)

(t/2 + 1/2)(2s + 1)

(3/2  t/2  2s)

!

(9)

where t = (p1 + p2)2 = 2p1p2. this amplitude has the pole structure

m2
closed = (4n  2)/

, m2

open = m/

the closed string channel indicates that there is a coupling between c, c and (ns, ns)
states, e.g., the  cc coupling in the bulk is non-zero. it also tell us that the coupling of c,
c and (ns+, ns+) is zero, e.g., there is no coupling between c, c and the massless ns-ns
states in the bulk.

the amplitude (9) is consistent with the gso projection of the open strings, i.e., it has
no pole corresponding to on-shell propagation of ns strings. alternatively, the amplitude
(9) indicates that there is no coupling between massless rr and ns strings on the d-
brane world-volume. for example, consider the coupling of the open string tachyon (a
state belonging to the ns sector) to the rr state on the world-volume of the d-brane.
the coupling is given by

at,rr  z dxd2z < v t(2k, x)v rr(, p, z, z) >

where the open string tachyon vertex operator v t(2k, x) = v1(2k, x) and the rr vertex
operator is given in (7). performing the correlators in above amplitude, one nds

a(t, c)  fa0ap(v)a0ap

and similar result for a(t, c) which are zero, because there is no p-form rr potential in
the type 0 theory.

3 closed-open-open amplitudes

scattering amplitudes with two massless open strings and one closed string can be read from
the corresponding amplitudes in type ii theories[5]. the amplitudes describing interaction
of one closed string tachyon and two massless open strings is given by

an s,n s,  z dx1dx2d2z tr < v n s(1, k1, x1)v n s(2, k2, x2)v  (p3, z3) >

where the open string vertex operators are

v n s(i, ki, xi) = i : v 

1(2ki, xi) : ti

for i = 1, 2 and the tachyon vertex operator is given by (2). here we have dened
iit i  iti where t s are the n  n generators of the u(n) gauge symmetry of the
coincident d-branes. using appropriate world-sheet propagators from [4], one can evaluate
the correlations above and show that the integrand in sl(2, r) invariant. gauging this
symmetry by xing z = i and x2 = , one arrives at
a  22s2z dx1 (2s + 1)12 
where the integral is taken from  to +, and s = p3apa
this integral is doable and the result is

3 = (k1 + k2)2 = 2k1k2.

we have also normalized the amplitude at this point by i/2. here the d-brane coupling
constant tp cancels with the normalization of open string states [12]. this amplitude has
the same pole structure as the corresponding amplitude for massless closed string states[5],
i.e., m2

open = (2n + 1)/.

4 world-volume interactions

to extract appropriate world-volume coupling of open and closed string states from string
theory amplitudes, one should expand the massive poles of string amplitudes and then
write a eld theory for massless elds and tachyon, if any, to reproduce those results. in
general, the eld theory should contain innite terms to reproduce eect of the massive
poles of string amplitudes. however, at low energy, one should not consider the terms which
have large number of momentum in the expansion. using this idea, in [12] we extracted
world-volume interaction of dierent massless open and closed string states from string

7

amplitudes. we then showed that they are consistent with born-infeld and chern-simons
action provided the closed string states treated as functionals of the nonabelian scalar elds
describing transverse uctuations of the dp-brane. in the present case, the world-volume
interaction of massless elds remain unchanged. the only dierence is that now we have
two set of rr elds.

now we do the same calculation to extract world-volume interaction of tachyon and
massless elds. we start with the simple case of two open and one closed string scattering
amplitude. this amplitude (10) has no massless pole, so at low energy it gives only contact
terms, that is,

a(a, a,  ) =

and a(a, ,  ) is zero. here we have suggestively introduced fiab = i(kiaib  kibia). these

where x i = i/qtp. taylor expansion of the rst term above reproduces the second term

of (12), the second and last term of (13) reproduces the rst term of equations (12) and
(11), respectively. the rst term in (13) is consistent with the result basing on the cylinder
amplitude [9].

now to nd non-derivative world-volume interaction of the tachyon to itself and to
other massless closed string elds, we expand their corresponding string amplitudes and
ignore the terms which have two and more momenta, that is,

and massless poles should be reproduced in eld theory by suitable world-volume and bulk
actions in einstein frame metric. the appropriate actions in the world-volume are the
born-infeld, the chern-simons and eq. (13), and in the bulk is3[9]

we use these actions to reproduce the tachyon and massless poles of the string amplitudes
(14), and then compare them with the string theory results to nd the new contact terms of
the world-volume eld theory. we will present the details of the calculations for scattering
with two tachyons. we begin by calculating the massless t-channel amplitude

where we used the fact that in the bulk both dilaton and graviton couple to two tachyons.

the dilaton and graviton sources and their corresponding propagators can also be derived
from (15)(they appear in [4]). now substituting these into (17), one nds

(19)

the rst term above reproduces the t-channel massless pole of string amplitude (14). this
insures that the normalization of string amplitude (3) is consistent with normalization of
bulk action (15). now, the s-channel amplitude corresponding to propagation of massless
open string on the d-brane world-volume can be evaluated as:

now we give more evidence in support of eq. (22). we evaluate some more world-
volume interactions in the presence of constant background eld and show that they are

kalb-ramond eld and (or) constant gauge eld strength, i.e., , f 12 = f 21  f . we

v  (p1, f , z1, z1) = : v0(p1, z1) :: v1(p1df , z1) :
v n s(k2, 2, f , x2) = 2g : v 

1(k2 + k2df, x2) : t2

where gab = (ab + dab
is a diagonal matrix given in [13]. performing the correlators above, one nds

f )/2 for the gauge elds and gij = n ij for scalar elds. and the dab

for the scalar and gauge states, it becomes

first term above is reproduced by taylor expansion of the linear tachyon in (22), and the
second term by expanding the square root in (22) around the background eld[13]. this
gives evidence that the tachyon has linear coupling to the born-infeld terms. to show
that the tachyon has quadratic coupling to the born-infeld terms as well, we consider
scattering amplitude of two tachyon and one massless open string ns state with d-brane.
this amplitude is given by

a,,n s

f

 z dxd2z1d2z2 tr < v  v  v n s > .

we are not going to make eorts here to evaluate this amplitude explicitly. however, from
the taylor expansion of the quadratic tachyon in (21), one may conclude that the scattering
amplitude above has the following contact term:

a,,n s

f

 (3gp1 + 3gp2)tr[t3] +   

for the gauge elds, this amplitude becomes

af (, , a) 

f3abf ab
1 + f 2 tr[t3] +    .

again this contact term is reproduced by the action (22). hence two tachyons couple with
the entire born-infeld terms. this ends our evidences in support of the action (22).

5 discussion

in this paper we have evaluated the amplitudes describing interaction of two closed string
tachyons, one tachyon and one massless state, and two dierent rr states with d-branes in

11

type 0 theories. we have also evaluated scattering amplitude of one closed string tachyon
and two massless open string states. we then examine these amplitudes in detail in order
to extract their world-volume couplings. we found that the tachyon dose not couple to
the rr elds on the d-branes. we have also found that the coupling of tachyon to other
massless elds can be described by some extension of the born-infeld action i.e., eq. (22).

evaluation of bulk eective actions for tachyon based on on-shell scattering amplitudes
calculations is uncertain. this steam from the fact that it is hard to distinguish between  2
and   , i.e., in the scattering amplitude it becomes p2 = 1. however, this is not the
case for the world-volume eective action. in this case, derivatives in the d-brane world-
volume and the transverse spaces, i.e., a and i, appear diering in the world-volume
action. hence the eective action (22) is unambiguous.

from the tachyon coupling to the gauge and to the scalar elds in (13), one concludes
that this eld couples with the 10-dimensional yang-mills theory reduced to the p + 1
dimensional world-volume. hence the action (13) or (22) is consistent with the t-duality.

the extended born-infeld action (22) in terms of the standard normalized elds (i.e.,

2 = t and see [12] for other elds) and in the string frame is

s = tpz dp+1 g(t /2)eqdet( gab + ebab + 2sfab) .

from this action, one nds that the eective yang-mills coupling is4

this is consistent with the power expansion of the following function

it would be interesting to nd cubic coupling of tachyon to the d-branes and see if it is
consistent with the above conjectured function.

4in the original version of ref. [14] the form of the yang-mills coupling was conjectured to be 1/g2
(1 + t )e. however, later on they found independently that the coupling should have structure 1/g2
(1 + t /4)e.
