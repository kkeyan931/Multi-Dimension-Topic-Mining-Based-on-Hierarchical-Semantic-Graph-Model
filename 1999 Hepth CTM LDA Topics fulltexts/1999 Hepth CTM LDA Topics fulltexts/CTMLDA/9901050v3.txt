- this is a set of introductory lecture notes on black holes in string the-
abstract.
ory. after reviewing some aspects of string theory such as dualities, brane solutions,
supersymmetric and non-extremal intersection rules, we analyze in detail extremal and
non-extremal 5d black holes. we rst present the d-brane counting for extremal black
holes. then we show that 4d and 5d non-extremal black holes can be mapped to the
btz black hole (times a compact manifold) by means of dualities. the validity of these
dualities is analyzed in detail. we present an analysis of the same system in the spirit
of the ads/cft correspondence. in the near-horizon limit (which is actually a near
inner-horizon limit for non-extremal black holes) the black hole reduces again to the btz
black hole. a state counting is presented in terms of the btz black hole.

introduction

the physics of 20th century is founded on two pillars: quantum theory and general
theory of relativity. quantum theory has been extremely successful in describing the
physics at microscopic scales while general relativity has been equally successful with
physics at cosmological scales. however, attempts to construct a quantum theory of
gravity stubble upon the problem of the non-renormalizability of the theory. is it really
necessary to have a quantum theory of gravity? why not having gravity classical and
matter quantized? is it just an aesthetic question or is there an internal inconsistency if
some of the physical laws are classical and some quantum? if some of the interactions
are classical then one could use only these interactions in order to arbitrarily obtain the
position and the velocity of particles, thus violating heisebergs uncertainty principle.
therefore, at the fundamental level, if some of the physical laws are quantum, all of them
have to be quantum.

it is amusing to see what happens if we insist on both classical general relativity
and the uncertainty principle. suppose we want to measure a spacetime coordinate with
accuracy x, then by the uncertainty principle there will be energy of order 1/x localized
in this region. but if x is very small then the energy will be so large that a black hole will
be formed, and the spacetime point will be hidden behind a horizon! one can estimate[1]
that the scale that leads to a black hole formation (through the uncertainty principle)
is of order of the planck length lp. therefore, classical general relativity and quantum
mechanics become incompatible at scales of order lp.

one of the most fascinating objects that general relativity predicts is black holes.
classically, black holes are completely black. objects inside their event horizon are eter-
nally trapped. even light rays are conned by the gravitational force. in addition, there
is a singularity hidden behind the horizon. in the early seventies, a number of laws that
govern the physics of black holes were established[24]. in particular, it was found that
there is a very close analogy between these laws and the four laws of thermodynamics[3].
the black hole laws become that of thermodynamics if one replaces the surface gravity
 of the black hole by the temperature t of a body in thermal equilibrium, the area of
the black hole a by the entropy s[4], the mass of the black hole m by the energy of the
system e etc. it is natural to wonder whether this formal similarity is more than just an
analogy. at the classical level one immediately runs into a problem if one tries to take
this analogy seriously: classically black holes only absorb so their temperature is strictly
zero. in a seminal paper[5], however, hawking showed that quantum mechanically black
holes emit particles with thermal spectrum. the temperature was found to be t = /2!

2

then from the rst law follows the bekenstein-hawking entropy formula,

s =

a
4gn

(1)

where gn is newtons constant. having established that black hole laws are thermody-
namic in nature one would like to understand what is the underlying microscopic theory.
what are the microscopic degrees of freedom that make up the black hole?

since black holes radiate, they lose mass and they may eventually evaporate. observ-
ing such a phenomenon is rather unlikely since one can estimate the lifetime of a black hole
of stellar mass to have lifetime1 longer than the age of the universe. the fact, however,
that black holes hawking radiate and may eventually evaporate leads to an important
paradox. the matter that falls into black hole has structure. the outgoing radiation,
however, is structure-less since it is thermal. what happens to the information stored in
the black hole if the black hole completely evaporates? if it gets lost then the evolution
is not unitary. hawking argued that these considerations imply that quantum mechanics
has to be modied. there is great controversy over the question of the nal state of black
holes, and there is no completely satisfactory scenario. we will not enter into this question
in this lectures. let us note, however, that the resolution of this problem may be related
to the question of understanding the microscopic description of black holes. radiation
from stars also has a thermal spectrum. however, we do not claim that information is
lost in stars. the thermal spectrum is due to averaging over microscopic states.

we have seen that semi-classical considerations yield a number of important issues.
any consistent quantum theory of gravity should provide answers to the questions raised
in the previous paragraphs. the leading candidate for a quantum theory of gravity is
string theory. therefore, string theory ought to resolve these issues.
issues involving
black holes are non-perturbative in nature. up until recently, however, we only had a
perturbative formulation of string theory. the situation changed dramatically over the
last few years. dualities have led to a unied picture of all string theories [6, 7]. moreover,
new non-perturbative objects, the d-branes, were discovered[8]. these new ingredients
made possible to tackle some of the problems mentioned above.

in this lectures we review recent progress in understanding black holes using string
theory. we start by briey reviewing perturbative strings, d-branes and dualities in sec-
tion 2. in particular, we review in some detail t-duality in backgrounds with isometries.
in section 3 we present the brane solutions of type ii and eleven dimensional supergrav-
ity, their connections through dualities, and a set of intersection rules that yields new

lifetime of order 1071(m/m )3 s.

solutions describing congurations of intersecting branes. we use these results in section
4 in order to study extremal and non-extremal black holes.
in section 4.1 we analyze
extremal 5d black holes. we show that one can derive the bekenstein-hawking entropy
formula by counting d-brane states. in section 4.2 we show that 4d and 5d non-extremal
black holes can be mapped to the btz black hole[9, 10] (times a compact manifold) by
means of dualities. we show that a general u-duality transformation preserves the ther-
modynamic characteristics of black holes. then we critically examine the so-called shift
transformation that removes the constant part from harmonic functions. we show that
this transformation also preserves the thermodynamic characteristics of the original black
hole. in general, however, it is not a symmetry of the theory. section 4.3 contains a short
introduction to ads/cft duality, and its application to black holes. the low-energy de-
coupling limit employed in the ads/cft correspondence (which is a near inner-horizon
limit for non-extremal black holes) also yields a connection with the btz black hole.
we use the connection to the btz black hole to infer a state counting for the higher
dimensional black holes.

previous reviews for black holes in string theory include [1113].

2 string theory and dualities.

in this section we present some aspects of string theory. the main purpose is to set
our conventions and to review certain material that they will be of use in later sections.

2.1 bosonic string and d-branes

the worldsheet action for the bosonic string is given by

s =

1

4 z d z 

0

dhhabax bx.

(2)

where h is the worldsheet metric. the tension of the string is given by t = 1/(2) (
is the square of the string length ls). varying the action we obtain

s = 

1

2 z d dhx  x  +

1

2 z d [hxx ]=

=0

(3)

in order to have a well-dened variational problem the last term should vanish. this
implies three dierent types of boundary conditions

x (, ) = x (,  + )
x ( = 0) = x ( = ) = 0
x ( = 0) = const, x ( = ) = const,

closed string

open string with neumann bc

open string with dirichlet bc

the neumann boundary conditions for the open string imply that there is no momen-
tum ow at the end of the string. with dirichlet boundary conditions, however, there is
momentum owing from the string to the hypersurface where the string ends. therefore,
this hypersurface, the d-brane, is a dynamical object.

one may (rst) quantize the string using standard methods. the closed string consist
of left and right movers. we denote the left and right level by n and n, respectively.
for open strings we have only one kind of oscillators. the perturbative spectrum for the
three kind of boundary conditions listed above is given by

m 2

closed =

m 2

open,n =

2
 (n + n  2)
1
 (n  1)
1
 (n  1)

+

m 2

open,d =   l

2!2

(4)

the term l/2=lt is the energy of a string of length l stretched between two d-branes.

5

from (4) follows that the massless spectrum of closed strings consist of a graviton g,
an antisymmetric tensor b and a dilaton . the massless spectrum of open strings with
neumann boundary conditions consists of a photon a. finally, for a string that ends
on a dp-brane, i.e.
the open string endpoints are conned to the p + 1-dimensional
worldvolume of the d-brane, we get a vector eld am, m = 0, . . . , p, that lives on the
worldvolume of the d-brane, and (25  p) scalars. the latter encode the uctuations of
the position of the d-brane.

the string coupling constant is not a new parameter but the expectation value of the
dilaton eld, hei = gs. string theory perturbation theory is weighted by g
s , where  is
the euler number of the string worldsheet. a compact surface can be built by adding
g handles, c cross-caps and b boundaries to the sphere.
its euler number is given by
 = 2  2g  b  c. hence, the closed string coupling constant is proportional to the
square of the open string coupling constant.

one may calculate the tension of d-branes[8, 14]

tp 

1

gslp+1

s

.

(5)

since the tension of the d-brane depends on the inverse of the string coupling constant,
d-branes are non-perturbative objects. notice that this behavior is dierent from the
behavior of eld theory solitons whose mass goes as 1/g2, where g is the eld theory
coupling constant. the existence of such non-perturbative objects is required by string
duality [7].

2.2 superstrings

there are ve consistent string theories; type iia and iib, type i, heterotic so(32)
and heterotic e8  e8. all of them are related through dualities. in this review we shall
concentrate on type ii theories, so we briey present some aspects of them.

the bosonic massless sector of type ii theories consist of the following elds

type iia
type iib

g b 
g b 

 c (3)
c (1)



c (0) c (2)

 c (4) +
 ,

where c (p) are p-index antisymmetric gauge elds. the + in c (4)+ indicates that the eld
strength is self-dual. the graviton g, the antisymmetric tensor b and the dilaton 
make up the nsns sector. these elds couple to perturbative strings. the rr sector
(i.e. the antisymmetric tensors c (p+1)), however, does not couple to perturbative strings
but rather to dp-branes.

6

extended objects naturally couple to antisymmetric tensors. the prototype example is

the coupling of the point particle to electromagnetic eld, r adx. similarly, fundamental

string naturally couple to b, and dp-branes to c (p+1)

z
bdx  dx
zmp+1

1p+1dx1      dxp+1
c (p+1)

(6)

where  and mp+1 is the string worldsheet and dp-brane worldvolume, respectively. to
each electric p-brane there is also a dual magnetic (6  p)-brane. (to see this notice
that dc (p+1) = d c (7p)). in particular, there is a solitonic 5-brane (ns5) that is the
in addition, strings can carry momentum.
magnetic dual of a fundamental string f1.
this corresponds in low energy to gravitational waves (w). the (hodge) dual to waves
are kaluza-klein monopoles (kk) (see section 3).

in summary, we have the following objects in type ii theory (d(-1) are d-instanton

and d9 are spacetime-lling branes)

type iia
type iib

w f1 ns5 kk
w f1 ns5 kk

d0 d2 d4 d6 d8

d(-1) d1 d3 d5 d7 d9

we have deduced the existence of dynamical extended objects by considering pertur-
bative string theory. these states, however, preserve half of maximal supersymmetry and
therefore continue to exit at all values of the string coupling constant.

2.3 dualities

a central element in the recent developments are the duality symmetries of string
theory. the duality symmetries are believed to be exact discrete gauge symmetries spon-
taneously broken by scalar vevs.

the best-understood duality symmetry is t-duality. this symmetry is visible in string
perturbation theory but it is non-perturbative on the worldsheet. t-duality relates com-
pactications on a manifold of (large) volume v to compactications on a manifold of
(small) volume 1/v. the simplest case is compactication on a circle. upon such com-
pactication the two type ii theories, and heterotic e8e8 and heterotic so(32) theories
are equivalent,

[iia]r
[het e8  e8]r

t [iib]1/r
t [het so(32)]1/r,

7

where the subscript indicates that the theory is compactied on a circle of radius r (1/r).

the action of t-duality on the various objects present in ii theories is given in table
1. the t-duality may be performed along one of the worldvolume directions or along a
transverse direction (for the kk monopole the transverse direction is taken to be the nut
direction (see section 3)). more generally, t-duality asserts that dierent spacetimes with

isometries may be equivalent in string theory. we shall present the argument in some
detail in the next section since we will make use of these results.

a (conjectured) non-perturbative symmetry is s-duality. this is non-perturbative
because it acts on the dilaton as gs  1/gs. thus, s-duality relates the strong coupling
regime of one theory to the weak coupling regime of another. in particular we have

iib

het so(32)

s iib
s t ype i

(7)

actually, iib string theory is believed to have an exact non-perturbative sl(2, z) symme-
try. in the following we shall only make use of the z2 subgroup that sends  = c (0) + ie
 , and leaves invariant c (4)+ (so, in terms of branes,
to 1/ , interchanges b with c (2)
s-duality interchanges f1 with d1, ns5 with d5, and leaves invariant the d3 brane).

s-duality allows one to get a handle to the strong coupling limit of three of the ve
string theories. in turns out that the strong coupling limit of iia and heterotic e8  e8
theories is of a more exotic nature. one gets instead an 11 dimensional theory, the
m-theory[7, 15]. m-theory on a small circle of radius r11 = gsls yields iia theory with
string coupling constant gs[7]. since perturbative string theory is an expansion around
gs = 0, the eleventh dimensions is not visible perturbatively. likewise, m-theory on an
interval gives e8  e8 string theory[16]. actually, all string theories can be obtained in
suitable limits from eleven dimensions.

8

although we do not have a fundamental understanding of what m-theory is, we
know that in low-energies m-theory reduces to 11 dimensional supergravity[17]. eleven-
dimensional supergravity compactied on a torus yields a lower dimensional poincare
supergravity with a certain duality group. the discretized version of this duality group
is conjectured[6] (and widely believed) to be an exact symmetry of m-theory. t and s
duality combine to yield this bigger group, the u-duality group.

2.3.1 buschers duality

consider the sigma model

s =

1

4 z d2 h[(habg + i

ab
h

b)ax bx  + r(2)] ,

(8)

where h and r(2) is the worldsheet metric and curvature, g is the target space metric
and b is a potential for the torsion 3-form h = db. this action is invariant under the
transformation

x  = k

(9)

when the vector eld k is a killing vector, the lie derivative of b is a total derivative
and the dilaton is invariant,

lkgij = ki;j + kj;i = 0,
lkb = kdb + dkb = d(v + kb)
lk = k = 0

(10)

one can now choose adapted coordinates {x } = {x, xi} such that the isometry acts by
translation of x, and all elds g, b and  are independent of x. in adapted coordinates,
the killing vector is equal to k/x  = /x.

to obtain the dual theory we rst gauge the symmetry and add a lagrange multiplier
 that imposes that the gauge connection is at [18]. the result (in the conformal gauge
and omitting the dilaton term) is (see [19], [20] for details)

s1 =

1

2 z d2z[(g + b)x  x  + (jk  ) a + ( jk + )a + k2a a]

(11)

where jk = (k + v)x , jk = (k  v) x  are the components of the noether current
associated with the symmetry. if one integrates out the lagrange multiplier eld , on a
topologically trivial worldsheet the gauge elds are pure gauge, a = , a = , and one
recovers the original model (8).

9

if one integrates out the gauge elds a, a one nds the dual model. one obtains (8)

but with dual background elds g, b, . in adapted coordinates {x } = {x, xi},

gxx =

gij = gij 
gxibxj  bxigxj

(12)

the dilaton shift is a quantum mechanical eect [21] (see [22] for recent careful discussion).

another useful way to write these transformation rules is to re-write the metric as

ds2 = gxx(dx + aidxi)2 + gijdxidxj

where ai = gxi/gxx. then the duality transformations take the form[23]

,

gxx =

1
gxx

2

ai = bxi,

bxi = ai,

bij = bij  2a[ibj]x

ln gxx

gij invariant

(13)

(14)

this form of the transformation rules exhibits most clearly the spacetime interpretation
of the duality transformations. the form of the metric in (13) is the standard kk ansatz
for reduction over x. dimensional reduction over x leads to a (d1)-dimensional theory
which is invariant under the transformations in (14). these transformations act only on
the matter elds and not on the pure gravitational sector.

let us now discuss under which conditions the dual models are truly equivalent as

conformal eld theories.

 compact vs non-compact isometries

in our discussion above we assumed that the worldsheet is trivial. let us relax this
condition. suppose also that we deal with a compact isometry. the constraint on a, a
that comes from integrating out the lagrange multiplier  implies a, a are at, but in
principle they still may have nontrivial holonomies around non-contractible loops. these
holonomies can be constrained to vanish if  has appropriate period[19, 20]. in summary,
dualizing along a compact isometry one obtains a dual geometry which also has a compact
isometry. the periods of the original and dual coordinate are reciprocal to each other. if
this condition does not hold, the two models are not fully equivalent but related via an
orbifold construction.

non-compact isometries can be considered as a limiting case. since in this case x
takes any real value, the dual coordinate  must have period zero. the dual manifold is
an orbifold obtained by modding out the translations in .

10

 isometries with xed points

in our analysis we also assumed that the isometry is spacelike. if the isometry is timelike
then it follows from (11) that the integration over the gauge eld yields a divergent factor.
if the isometry is null then the quadratic in the gauge eld term in (11) vanishes. therefore
these cases require special attention. we refer to [2426] for work concerning dualization
(or the closely related issue of dimensional reduction) along timelike or null isometries.

a spacelike isometry may act freely or have xed points. a typical example of an
isometry without xed points are the translational symmetries on tori. on the other
hand, rotational isometries have xed points. at the xed point k2 = 0. it follows from
(12) (using k2 = gxx) that the dual geometry appears to have a singularity at the xed
point.

taking the curvature of the spacetime to be small in string units (which is required
for consistency for strings propagating in a background that only solves the lowest order
beta functions) we see that we may approximate the vicinity of the xed point by at
space. in adapted coordinates, which are just polar coordinates, the isometry direction
being the angular coordinate, we have

ds2 = dr2 + r2d2.

dualizing along  we obtain

ds2 = dr2 +

1
r2 d2,

 = 

1
2

ln r2.

(15)

(16)

so indeed the xed point of the isometry, i.e. r = 0, becomes a singular point after the
duality transformation. since the curvature now diverges at r = 0 we cannot trust the
(rst order in ) sigma model analysis. a more careful conformal eld theory analysis[27]
shows that the duality yields an exact equivalence but the operator mapping includes all
orders in . we can read this results as follows: all order  corrections resolve the
singularity present in the spacetime described by (16) yielding an exact non-singular
conformal eld theory.

studies of t-duality along a rotational isometry can be found in [2830].

11

3 brane solutions

string theory has a mass gap of order 1/ls. at low enough energies only the massless
elds are relevant. we can decouple the massive modes by sending   0 (so the mass of
the massive modes goes to innity). the interactions of the massless elds are described
by an eective action. for iia and iib superstring theories the low energy theory is iia
and iib supergravity, respectively. we have seen that in type ii string theories there exist
dynamical objects other than strings, namely d-branes, and solitonic branes. for each
of these objects there is a corresponding solution of the low energy supergravity. the
purpose of this section is to describe these solutions. for reviews see [3133].

the relevant part of the supergravity action, in the string frame, is 2

of describing the long range eld of fundamental strings (f1), dp-branes and solitonic

values of the parameters  and  for each solution are given in table 2. in the same table
we also give the values of the charges qi. the constant dp is equal to dp = (2)5p( 7p

s-duality leaves invariant the action in the einstein frame. to reach the einstein
frame we need to do the weyl rescaling ge = e/2gst. using the fact that under s-
duality    (and gs  1/gs) we get g  eg. the compactication radii are
measured using the string metric. so, they change under s-duality. one can take care
of this by changing the string scale,   gs. we therefore get the following s-duality
transformation rules

t-duality acts as in (12) in the nsns sector. in particular, dualization along a coor-

depending on whether we dualize along a coordinate transverse or parallel to the brane.

it is easy to see that the values of the charges qi are consistent with dualities. for
instance, under s-duality: qn s5 = n  ngs = q5. actually, dualities determine
both the value of newtons constant and the charges (including the numerical coecients)
[12]: the mass m of an object can be calculated from the deviation of the einstein metric
from the at metric at innity. in particular[36],

the mass m appearing in this formula is the same as the mass measured in the string
frame since we used the convention to leave a factor of g2
s in newtons constant. these
masses can be easily obtained by u-duality. knowledge of one of the coecients in (29)
is sucient to determine gn and therefore all other coecients as well. in [12] the value
of cn s5 was determined from the dirac quantization condition. perhaps the simplest way
to proceed is to observe that the coecient in the harmonic function of the kk monopole
is xed by requiring that the solution is non-singular.

all these solutions are bps solution and preserve half of maximal supersymmetry.
this implies that certain quantities do not renormalize. let us sketch the argument. the
supersymmetry algebra has the form

{q, q}  (c)p + (c1p)z (p)

1p

(30)

where c the charge conjugation matrix, q are the supercharges, p is the momentum
generator, and z (p) are central charges. these are the charges carried by p branes.

taking the expectation value of (30) between a physical state |ai and going to the

rest frame we get

ha|{q, q}|ai = (m a  c|z|)  0

(31)

where m a
positive denite matrix.

 is the mass matrix, c is a constant, and we used the fact that {q, q} is a

if the matrix in the right hand side has no zero eigenvalues, then one can take suit-
able linear combinations of the supercharges so that the superalgebra takes the form of
fermionic oscillator algebra. then half of oscillators can be regarded as creation and half
as annihilation operators. this means that a supermultiplet contains 216 states.

if the matrix in the right hand side of (31) has a zero eigenvalue (so the mass is
proportional to the charge, m = c|z|, i.e. we have a bps state) then some of the
generators annihilate the state. the remaining supercharges can again be divided into
half creation and half annihilation operators. thus, the bps supermultiplet is a short
multiplet. for 1/2 supersymmetric states, such as the branes we have been discussing,
this means that we have 28 states instead of 216.

if we vary adiabatically the parameters of theory (i.e. no phase transition) the number
of states cannot change abruptly, so the number of bps states remains invariant and the
mass/charge relation does not renormalize[38]. (here we also assume that we do not cross
curves of marginal stability).

3.1 m-branes

we briey describe the connection of the brane solutions described in the previous
section to m-theory. m-theory at low-energies is described by eleven dimensional super-
gravity. the bosonic eld content of eleven dimensional supergravity consists of a metric,
gm n , and a three-form antisymmetric tensor, am n p . we therefore expect that this the-
ory has solutions describing extended objects coupled electrically and magnetically
to am n p . indeed, one nds a 2-brane solution, m2, and a vebrane solution, m5[39, 40].

15

the explicit form of the solution is as in (18), with m 2 = 1/3 for the m2 and m 5 = 2/3
for the m5 (there is no dilaton eld in 11d supergravity, so  = 0). in addition, we have
the purely gravitational solutions describing traveling waves and kk monopoles.

from the solutions of eleven dimensional supergravity one can obtain the solution of
iia supergravity upon dimensional reduction. the kaluza-klein ansatz for the bosonic
elds leading to the string frame 10d metric is

tensors of iia theory. dimensionally reducing the m-branes along a worldvolume or a
transverse direction one obtains all solution of iia as follows:

3.2 intersection rules

in the previous section we described brane solutions of supergravity theories. these
solutions can be used as building blocks in order to construct new solutions [4151] (for
a review see [52]). the new solutions can be interpreted as intersecting (or in some
cases overlapping) branes.
in order to obtain a supersymmetric solution only certain
intersections are allowed.

the intersection rules are as follows:

one superimposes the single brane solutions using the rule that all pairwise intersections
should belong to a set of allowed intersections.
if all harmonic functions are taken to
depend on the overall transverse directions (i.e. the directions transverse to all branes) we
are dealing with a standard intersection. otherwise the intersection will be called non-
standard. in d = 11 there are three standard intersections, (0| 2  2)4, (1| 2  5) and
(3| 5  5) [42, 43, 47], and one non-standard (1|5  5)[53, 43]. in the latter intersection the
harmonic functions depend on the relative transverse directions (i.e. the directions which
are worldvolume coordinates of the one but transverse coordinates of the other vebrane).
in addition, one can add a wave solution along a common string. the intersection rules
in ten dimensions can be derived from these by dimensional reduction plus t and s-
duality. we collect the standard and non-standard intersection rules in the table below.

4the notation (q| p1  p2) denotes a p1-brane intersecting with a p2-brane over a q-brane.

16

(for intersections rules involving kk monopoles see [49]). when both standard and non-
standard intersection rules are used (as for instance in the solutions of [54]), one has to
specify which coordinates each harmonic function depends on. this is usually clear by
inspection of the intersection, but it can also be further veried by looking at the eld
equation(s) for the antisymmetric tensor eld(s).

there is a simple algorithm which leads to non-extreme version of a given supersym-
metric solution (constructed according to standard intersection rules)[44]. we will give
these rules for m-brane intersections. this is sucient as dimensional reduction and
duality produce all standard intersections of type ii branes. it consists of the following
steps:

(1) make the following replacements in the d-dimensional transverse spacetime part

of the metric:
dt2  f (r)dt2 ,

in the extreme limit   0, f  , and t  , while the charges qf and qt are
kept xed. in this case qf = qf and qt = qt , so that h 
t = ht . the form of f4 and
the actual value of its magnetic part does not change compared to the extreme limit.

(3) in the case there is a common string along some direction x, one can add momentum

along x. then

f (r)dt2 + dx2  k 1(r)f (r)dt2 + k(r)(cid:16)dx  [k 1(r)  1]dt(cid:17)2

in the extreme limit   0, k  , the charge qk is held xed, k = k  and thus the
metric (36) becomes dudv + (k  1)du2, where u, v = x  t.

4 black holes in string theory

black holes arise in string theory as solutions of the corresponding low-energy super-
gravity theory. string theory lives in 10 dimensions (or 11 from the m-theory perspec-
tive). suppose the theory is compactied on a compact manifold down to d spacetime
dimensions. branes wrapped in the compact dimensions will look like pointlike objects in
the d-dimensional spacetime. so, the idea is to construct a conguration of intersecting
wrapped branes which upon dimensional reduction yields a black hole spacetime. if the
brane intersection is supersymmetric then the black hole will be extremal supersymmetric
black hole. on the other hand, non-extremal intersections yield non-extremal black holes.

in general, the regime of the parameter space in which supergravity is valid is dierent
from the regime in which weakly coupled string theory is valid. thus, although we know
that a given brane conguration becomes a black hole when we go from weak to strong
coupling, it would seem dicult to extract information about the black hole from this
fact.

for supersymmetric black holes, however, the bps property of the states allows one
to learn certain things about black holes from the weakly coupled d-brane system. for
example, one can count the number of states at weak coupling and extrapolate the result
to the black hole phase. in this way, one derives the bekenstein-hawking entropy formula
(including the precise numerical coecient) for this class of black holes[55, 56]. we will
review this calculation in section 4.1.

in the absence of supersymmetry, we cannot in general follow the states from weak to
strong coupling. however, one could still obtain some qualitative understanding of the
black hole entropy. on general grounds, one might expect that the transition from weakly
coupled strings to black holes happens when the string scale becomes approximately equal
to the schwarzschild radius (or more generally to the curvature radius at the horizon).
this point is called the correspondence point. demanding that the mass and the all
other charges of the two dierent congurations match, one obtains that the entropies
also match [57]. these considerations correctly provide the dependence of the entropy on
the mass and the other charges, but the numerical coecient in the bekenstein-hawking
entropy formula remains undetermined.

in [58] a dierent approach was initiated. instead of trying to determine the physics
of black holes using the fact that at weak coupling they become a set of d-branes, the
symmetries of m-theory are used in order to map the black hole conguration to another
black hole conguration. since the u-duality group involves strong/weak transitions one

19

does not, in general, have control over the microscopic states that make up a generic con-
guration. we will see, however, that the situation is better when it comes to black holes!
u-duality maps black holes to black holes with the same thermodynamic characteristics,
i.e. the entropy and the temperature remain invariant. this implies that the number of
microstates that make up the black hole conguration remains the same. notice that to
reach this conclusion we did not use supersymmetry, but the fact that the area of the
horizon of a black hole (divided by newtons constant) tell us how many degree of freedom
the black hole contains. we discuss this approach in section 4.2.

the eect of the u-duality transformations described in section 4.2 is to remove the
constant part from certain harmonic functions (and also change the values of some mod-
uli). one can achieve a similar result by taking the low-energy limit   0 while keeping
xed the masses of strings stretched between dierent d-branes. considerations involving
this limit lead to the ads/cft correspondence[59]. this will be discussed in section 4.3.

4.1 extremal black holes and the d-brane counting

we will analyze ve dimensional black holes. four dimensional ones [60] can be ana-
lyzed in a completely analogous manner[61, 62]. rotating black holes have been discussed
in [6365].

4.1.1 5d extremal black holes

to study extremal charged ve dimensional black holes we build a conguration of inter-
secting branes using the supersymmetric intersection rules. in particular, we consider the
conguration of n5 d5-brane wrapped in x1, . . . , x5, n1 d1-brane wrapped in x1, with
nk momentum modes along x1. the coordinates xi, i = 1, . . . , 5 are taken periodic with
periods ri. explicitly, the spacetime elds are

4.1.2 d-brane counting

we now turn to the weak-coupling d-brane conguration in order to compute the d-
brane entropy. counting the degeneracy of d-brane states translates into the question
of counting bps states in the d-brane worldvolume theory[6670]. for the system we
are interested in, and taking the torus t 4 in the relative transverse directions to be
small, r2, r3, r4, r5  r1, the relevant worldvolume theory is 1+1 dimensional. this
theory is the infrared limit of the higgs branch of the 1+1 gauge theory, and it has been
argued to be a deformation of the supersymmetric n = (4, 4) sigma model with target
space (t 4)n1n5/sn1n5[68]. since (t 4)n1n5/sn1n5 is a hyperkaehler manifold of dimension
4n1n5, the sigma model has central charge equal to 6n1n5. this is the central charge of
4n1n5 bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom (since scalars contribute 1 and fermions
1/2 to the central charge). roughly, these degrees of freedom are the ones describing the
motion of the d1 brane inside the d5 brane. for details we refer to [12].

in the worldvolume theory we get that the right movers are in their ground state and
the left movers carry nk momentum modes. thus, the degeneracy of the d-brane system
is given by the degeneracy of the conformal eld theory of central charge c = 6n1n5
at level nk. for a unitary conformal eld theory the degeneracy is given by cardys
formula[71]

(48)

(49)

d(c, nk)  exp(2r c

6

nk)

therefore, the entropy is equal to

this is in exact agreement with (45).

s = log d(c, nk) = 2qn1n5nk

let us now inspect the regime of validity of the d-brane picture. open string diagrams
pick up a factor gsn1,5 because the open string coupling constant is gs and there are n1,5
branes where the string can end (or equivalently one should sum over the chan-paton
factors). processes involving momenta involve a factor g2
s nk[72]. therefore, conventional
d-brane perturbation theory is good when

gsn1, gsn5, g2

s nk  1  q1, q5, qk  ,

(50)

which is precisely the opposite regime to (47) where the classical supergravity solution
is good. the d-brane/string perturbation theory and black hole regimes are thus com-
plementary. this feature is related to open-closed string duality. due to supersymmetry,
however, one can extrapolate results obtained in the d-brane phase to the black hole
phase.

22

4.2 non-extremal black holes and the btz black hole

in this section we review the approach of [58]. the idea is to use u-dualities in order
to connect higher dimensional black holes to lower dimensional ones. such ideas also
appeared in [73]. the u-duality transformation essentially maps the initial black hole to
its near-horizon region (but schwarzschild black holes are also included as a limiting case).
in particular, four and ve dimensional black holes are mapped to the three dimensional
btz black hole. the u-duality group of string (or m) theory on a torus does not change
the number of non-compact dimensions. however, black hole spacetimes always contain an
extra timelike isometry. this extra isometry allows for a duality transformation, the shift
transformation[74], that yields trans-dimensional transformations. a thorough discussion
(that includes global issues) of the shift transformation is given in section 4.2.2.

4.2.1 u-duality and entropy

let us discuss whether one can use u-duality in order to infer a state counting for a
given black hole from the counting of a u-dual conguration. the u-duality group is
conjectured (and widely believed) to be an exact symmetry of m-theory. this symmetry,
however, is spontaneously broken by the vacuum. the vacua of m-theory (compactied
on some manifold) are parametrized by a set constants. these constants are expectation
values of scalar elds arising from the compactication. u-duality acts on these scalars, so
it transforms one vacuum to another. therefore, from a state on a given vacuum one can
deduce by u-duality the existence of another state in a new vacuum. since the u-duality
group contains s-duality which is strong/weak coupling duality, one cannot in general
continue the new state back to the original vacuum, unless this state is protected from
quantum corrections. states with this property are bps states. therefore, the spectrum
of bps states is invariant under u-duality transformations. this implies in particular that
if we want to count the number of states that make up an extremal supersymmetric black
hole, we may use any u-duality conguration. indeed, the entropy formula for extremal
black holes is u-duality invariant[7578].

the question is whether it is justied to use u-duality in more general context. a
remarkable fact about s and t duality transformations is that they leave invariant both
the entropy and the temperature of black holes connected by s and t transformations.
for s-duality this follows from the fact that s-duality leaves invariant the einstein metric.
for t-duality, this has been shown in [23]. we review this argument here.

consider a black hole solution with a timelike isometry /t, a compact spacelike

23

isometry /x, and a nsns 2-form b turned on. smoothness near the horizon requires[23]
that the btx vanishes at the horizon. in order the t-dual geometry to also be smooth
(i.e. the dual 2-form to vanish at the horizon) we require in addition that ax = 0 at the
horizon (see (13)-(14)). (this can always be achieved by a coordinate transformation.)
rr potentials that can be turned into bxt by dualities are also required to vanish at the
horizon.

let us rst discuss the entropy. in d dimensions the einstein metric is given by (see

(28)),

ds2

e = e4/(d2)[gxx(dx + aidxi)2 + gijdxidxj]

(51)

the metric induced on the horizon is of the same form but with i, j taking values only
over the d  3 angular variables. therefore, the area is equal to

ad = z q(e4/(d2))d2gxx det g = z e2gxxqdet g

(52)
one may check that e2gxx is a t-duality invariant combination (and g was invariant
to start with). therefore, the entropy of black holes is t-duality invariant.

let us also note that the entropy formula is invariant under dimensional reduction

s =

a10
4g(10)

n

(53)

since ad = a10/v10d and g(d)

we now turn to the discussion of the behavior of the hawking temperature under
duality transformations. perhaps the simplest way to compute the hawking temperature
is to analytically continue to euclidean space by taking t   = it. the black hole
spacetime becomes then a non-singular riemannian manifold provided that the euclidean
time is periodically identied with period the inverse hawking temperature. suppose that
the horizon is at r = . one can calculate the temperature to be equal to (we assume
that the event horizon is non-degenerate)

th =

rg 

4g  grr(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=

(54)

it follows by inspection that the hawking temperature is invariant under non-singular
weyl rescaling. hence, it does not make any dierence whether we consider the einstein
or the string frame. we choose to work with the string frame. from (13) we get

g  = g  + gxxa a ,

grr = grr + gxxarar

(55)

24

assuming that ar is nite at the horizon (in all case we will consider ar = 0), and using
gxx|r= = a|r= = 0 we obtain

th =

which is manifestly t-duality invariant.

r g 

4g  grr(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=

(56)

therefore, an arbitrary combination of s and t transformations will lead to a black
hole solution with the same entropy and temperature as the original one. this implies that
black holes connected by u-duality transformations have the same number of microstates.
this is somewhat surprising since for non-supersymmetric black holes we cannot follow the
states during u-duality transformations. as we move from one conguration to a u-dual
one, some states may disappear. however, an equal number of states has to appear, since
the nal conguration has the same entropy. we do not have a microscopic derivation
of this fact. we believe that such derivation will be an important step towards further
understanding of black holes.

a general u-duality transformation may involve strong/weak transitions. the u-
duality transformations, however, that we will use below do not involve such strong/weak
transitions. actually we shall exclusively be in the black hole phase. we will only con-
sider transformations, call them ut , that are connected to t-dualities by a similarity
transformation

ut = u 1t u

(57)

where u denotes a generic u-duality transformation and t a sequence of two t-duality
transformations (so ut acts within the same theory).

4.2.2 the shift transformation

as we have discussed, we construct black holes congurations using appropriate non-
extremal intersections of extremal branes. these congurations are solutions of the eld
equations provided the various harmonic functions hi appearing in the solution satisfy
laplaces equations,

2hi = 0,

(58)

where  is the laplacian in the overall transverse space. the constant part of the har-
monic function is usually set to one in order the solution to be asymptotically at. clearly,
up to normalization, the only other choice is to set this constant to zero. this choice has
the dramatic eect of changing the asymptotics of the solution. we will see, however, that
there is a duality transformation, the shift transformation, that removes the one from the

25

harmonic function. this duality transformation has been appeared in the past in various
contexts [79, 20, 28, 73, 74, 58, 80, 25].

the constant part of the antisymmetric tensor btx1 is xed by the requirement that btx1

the radius of x1 also changes to cosh /r1.

(68)

the radius of x1 is now equal to r1/ cosh . in addition, there is a again a change in
newtons constant. one can calculate the temperature and entropy of this solution. the
result for the entropy is the same in (61). the temperature is equal to th = (d 3)/4.
this diers by a factor of cosh  from (61). this is due to the fact that the timelike killing
vectors /t and /t dier by a factor of cosh  (see (63)).

to summarize, the eect of the shift transformation (62) is to change the solution by
removing the constant part of the harmonic functions. all the dependence of the metric
and the antisymmetric tensor on the non-extremality angle  resides in the radius of the
compact direction which after the shift transformation is equal to r1/ cosh . in addition,

the orbits of the killing vector /x

1 are non-compact since the time coordinate is
non-compact. this means that (59) and (68) are not equivalent. to make the duality
1.5
transformation a symmetry we need to compactify the orbits of the killing vector /x
the fact, however, that the entropy and temperature of the one black hole can be deduced

5one way to make the orbits compact is to compactify time with appropriately chosen radius. it has
been argued in [81] that a spatially wrapped brane should also be wrapped in time in order to avoid
conical singularities at the horizon. the two issues may be related. the time coordinate is naturally
compact in euclidean black holes, the radius of the time coordinate being the inverse of the hawking
temperature. one may try to formulate the analysis in the euclidean framework. the problem is then
that the coordinate transformation (65) is complex.

same universality class (in a loose sense).

the norm of the killing vector (63) is

|/x

1|2 =

(69)

therefore the isometry is spacelike everywhere but it becomes null at spatial innity. let
us examine the (r, x1) part of the metric close to spatial innity. from (66) we get

ds2

(r,x1) = dr2 +

d3
rd3 dx2

(70)

for d = 5, which will be the case in the next section where we discuss ve dimensional
black holes, this is exactly the same metric as in (16). this suggest to consider r, x1 as
polar coordinates and the isometry in x1 as a rotational isometry with a xed point at
innity.

4.2.3 connection of 5d and 4d black holes to the btz black hole

we are now ready to use our results to study non-extremal 5d and 4d black holes. we
will explicitly work out the case of 5d black holes. the analysis of 4d black holes is
completely analogous [58]. four and ve dimensional black holes can also be mapped
by similar operations [73, 58, 82] to two dimensional black holes[83]. let us also note
that the manipulations we describe here cannot connect the btz black hole to higher
than ve dimensional black holes [58]. the relation between the near-horizon limit of
higher-dimensional black holes and the btz black hole has also been investigated in [84].

the solution we will study is the non-extremal version of (38). explicitly, the metric,

the dilaton and the antisymmetric tensor are given by

this black hole is charged with respect to the kaluza-klein gauge elds originating from
the antisymmetric tensor elds and the metric. when all charges are set equal to zero one
obtains the 5d schwarzschild black hole. the metric (74) has an outer horizon at r = 
and an inner horizon at r = 0.

we will now show that one can connect this black hole to the btz black hole times
a 3-sphere using transformations of the form (57). a u-transformation is used to map a
given brane to a fundamental string. the t transformation is the shift transformation
(62).

for the case at hand we need to perform the shift transformation to the d1 and the

d5 brane. the nal result is given by the metric in (71), but with

we can now calculate the entropy of the resulting black hole. the area of the horizon

it follows that s = a3/(4g(3)

nal conguration is equal to the one of the original 5d black hole. notice that the newton
constant in (86) contains the parameter 1, 5, i.e. carries information on the charge of
the original d1 and d5 brane. the temperature of the btz black hole is equal to

transforming to the original variables we get

(87)

(88)

we nish this section by pointing out a remarkable fact: we have started with the so-
lution (71) of the low-energy supergravity. this solution is expected to get  corrections.
then we used the t-duality rules (12) which are also valid only to rst order in . the
nal result, however, is valid to all orders in !

the elds in (81), (84) have their canonical value, so that both the btz and the
sphere part are separately exact classical solutions of string theory,6 i.e.
there is an
exact cft associated to each of them. for the btz black hole the cft corresponds
to an orbifold of the wzw model based on sl(2, ir) [79, 85, 86], whereas for s3 and the
associated antisymmetric tensor with eld strength h, given in (84), the appropriate cft
description is in terms of the so(3) wzw model. the same result also holds in the case
of 4d black holes[58]. this time the black hole is mapped to bt z  s2. again all elds
are such that there is an exact cft associated to each factor. the one associated with
s2 is the monopole cft of [87].

the situation seems quite similar to the case described at the end of section 2.3.1:
there we had the singular solution (16) of the lowest order in  beta function equation
which becomes an exact cft after dualization with respect to a killing vector whose norm
vanishes at spatial innity. however, to establish equivalence one needs all order in .

in the case of black holes we have:

the singular black hole spacetime (71) that solves the lowest order in  beta functions

6for the d1-d5 system that we discuss we obtain a cft describing a d-string. one gets a fundamental

string from the s-dual system of f1-ns5.

31

becomes, after dualization with respect to a killing vector whose norm vanishes at spatial
innity (plus other dualities), the btz black hole which contains no curvature singularity
and is an exact cft. (so, one could argue that the original singularity is resolved by 
corrections).

we nd these similarities quite suggestive. however, it is dicult to see how one could
overcome the problem of the non-compactness of the orbits of the killing vector in (63).

4.3 low-energy limit and the near-horizon geometry

4.3.1 near-horizon limit of branes

we have argued that the physical system describing a black hole in strong coupling be-
comes a set of intersecting branes in weak coupling. we emphasize that there is only
one physical system. its description, however, in terms of some weakly coupled theory
changes as we change the parameters of the theory, and furthermore, at any given regime
of the parameter space, there is only one weakly coupled description.

one may view the dierent descriptions as eective theories that are adequate to
describe the system at specic range of the parameter space. as we go outside this range
new degrees of freedom become important and a new description takes over.
in some
cases, however, a given theory may still be well-dened for any value of the coupling
constant. in this case we get a dual description of this theory.

let us consider n coincident dp-branes. at weak coupling they have a description as
hypersurfaces where string can end. there is worldvolume theory describing the collective
coordinates of the brane. the worldvolume elds interact among themselves and with the
bulk elds. we would like to consider a limit which decouples the bulk gravity but still
leaves non-trivial dynamics on the worldvolume. in low energies gravity decouples. so,
we consider the limit   0 , which implies that the gravitation coupling constant, i.e.
newtons constant, gn  4, also goes to zero. we want to keep the worldvolume degrees
of freedom and their interactions. since the worldvolume dynamics are governed by open
string ending on the d-branes, we keep xed the masses of strings stretched between
d-branes as we take the limit   0. in addition, we keep xed the coupling constant
of the worldvolume theory, so all the worldvolume interactions remain present. for n
coincident d-branes, the worldvolume theory is an su(n) super yang-mills theory (we
ignore the center of mass part). the ym coupling constant is equal (up to numerical

32

constants) to g2

y m  gs()(p3)/2. thus we get that the following limit,

  0,

u =

r
 = xed,

g2
y m = xed

(89)

yields a decoupled theory on the worldvolume.

at strong coupling the dp branes are described by the black p-brane spacetimes (18).
let us consider the limit (89) for this spacetime. one gets that the harmonic function
becomes,

hi  g2

y m n()2u p7

(90)

the limit (89) is a near-horizon limit since r = u  0 and there is a horizon at r = 0.
we see that the eect of the limit (89) is similar to the eect of the shift transformation,
namely the one is removed from the harmonic function. inserting (90) back in the metric
one nds that the spacetime becomes conformal to adsp+2  s8p [54, 88] (for m-branes,
one gets ads4  s7 for the m2 brane and ads7  s4 for the m5 brane [89]).

let us now consider the particular case of n coincident d3-branes. the worldvolume
theory is d = 4, n = 4 su(n) sym theory. this is a nite unitary theory for any value
of the its coupling constant. on the other hand, this system has a description as a black
3-brane at strong coupling. in the limit (89) we get that the spacetime becomes ads5s5.
in order to suppress string loops we need to take n large. for the supergravity description
to be valid t hoofts coupling constant[90], g2
y m n, must be large. we therefore get that
the strong (t hooft) coupling limit of large d = 4, n = 4 su(n) sym is described by
ads supergravity[59]!

n = 4 d = 4 sym theory is a well-dened unitary nite theory, whereas supergravity
is a non-renormalizable theory. it is best to think about it as the low energy eective
theory of strings. therefore, one should really consider strings on ads5  s5. in this way
we reach the celebrated ads/cft duality[59]7:

four dimensional n = 4su(n) sym is dual to string theory on ads5  s5.
this conjecture was made precise in [92, 93], where a prescription for evaluation of
correlation functions was proposed. subsequently a large number of papers appeared, all
of them supporting the ads/cft duality.

let us examine again our result. we obtained that ve dimensional ads gravity is
equivalent to d = 4, n = 4 sym theory. in other words, a gravity theory in d + 1(=5)
dimensions is described in terms of a eld theory without gravity in d(=4) dimensions.

7many of the elements leading to this conjecture appeared in [91]. in [58], the worldvolume theory of

the d3 brane was argued to be mapped to the singleton of ads5 by the shift transformation.

33

this is just holography[94, 95]! one can further show that the boundary theory indeed
has one degree of freedom per planck area[96].

similar results hold for other brane congurations as one can always consider the low
energy limit. in the case of conformal worldvolume theories there is an ads factor on
the gravity side. in these cases the worldvolume theory is valid at all energy scales, and
these considerations provide a weakly coupled gravity description of a strongly coupled
theory. in the non-conformal cases the worldvolume sym theory is a theory with a cut-
o. as we change the cut-o new degrees of freedom become relevant and the description
in terms of a sym theory may not be valid. in these cases one nds that as we change
the parameters of the theory there is always some perturbative description[97, 98]. the
black p-brane solution becomes conformal to anti-de sitter spacetime and the gravity
description is in terms of gauged supergravities which have domain-wall vacua[88].

4.3.2 low-energy limit of black hole spacetimes

let us discuss the low energy limit for black hole congurations. we will discuss in detail
the 5d case. the 4d case is very similar [99]. rotating black holes have been considered
in [100].

consider the black hole conguration in (38). we go to low energies keeping xed the
masses of stretched strings, the radius of coordinate which the string is wrapped in and
the radii of the relative transverse directions in string units,

  0,

u =

r
 xed,

r1, ri =

ri

xed i = 2, . . . , 5

(91)

notice that r1  ri, i = 2, . . . , 5, as in section 4.1.2. since the horizon is at r = 0
and r = u  0 this is at the same time a near-horizon limit. therefore, the resulting
conguration has the same number of degrees of freedom as the original one (since the
area of the horizon is a measure of the degrees of freedom).

in the limit (91) the harmonic functions (41) become

where ds2
bt z is the metric (81) with + =  = 0, i.e. the metric of the extremal btz
black hole. the overall factor in (94) originates from the fact that we want to have the
angle  with unit radius. we move this overall factor to newtons constant by a weyl
rescaling. the three dimensional netwons constant is then equal to (taking into account
the dilaton, and arranging such that the 3d metric is the standard btz metric (81))

g(3)

s q q1 q5 qk = 2qn1n5nk

(96)

(97)

as in (45) (as it should since we just took the near-horizon limit). therefore, at low
energies the physics of extremal black holes is governed by the btz black hole.

let us now move to non-extremal black holes. in this case, the low energy limit is

supplemented by the condition[101],

0 =


 xed

(98)

the non-extremal black hole (71) has an outer horizon at r =  and an inner horizon at
r = 0. therefore, the low-energy limit (91), (98) is a near inner-horizon rather than near

35

outer-horizon limit. as a result the entropies do not agree in general. to see this observe
that the eect of the low energy limit (91), (98) is to remove the one from the harmonic
functions h1 and h5 but leave k unchanged[101]. since before we take the low energy
limit, hi(r = ) = cosh2 i, i = 1, 5 and after the low energy limit hi(r = ) = sinh2 i,
the entropies of the two congurations dier by a factor of tanh 1 tanh 5. unless this
factor is equal to one, the low energy conguration will contain dierent number of degrees
of freedom. this factor is equal to one in the dilute gas approximation [102]

1, 5  1,

(99)

and therefore the entropies agree in this approximation. far from extremality the number
of degrees of freedom changes as we go to low energies. in all cases the low energy regime
is governed by the btz black hole. this result should be contrasted with the result in
the previous section. there we also found that 4d and 5d black holes are connected to
the btz black hole. all our transformations, however, were isoentropic, and there was
no limit involved. we only needed that the supergravity approximation is valid.

let us nish by presenting a microscopic derivation of the bekenstein-hawking entropy
formula for extremal black hole (38) using the results of this section. it has been shown
by brown and henneaux [103] that the asymptotic symmetry group of ads3 is generated
by two copies of the virasoro algebra with central charge

c =

3l

2g(3)
n

(100)

this central charge was also derived through the ads/cft correspondence in [104].
therefore, any consistent theory of gravity on ads3 is conformal eld theory with central
charge equal to (100).

the generators of the asymptotic virasoro are related to the mass and angular mo-

mentum as

(l0 + l0),

1
l

m =
j = l0  l0

(101)

where we have normalized l0, l0 such that they vanish for the massless black hole.

in the case of the 5d extremal black hole, and after the low-energy limit is taken, we
obtain a geometry of the form bt z  s3  t 4. one may dimensionally reduce over the
compact spaces to obtain the btz black hole and a set of matter elds. the btz black
hole is asymptotically ads3 so quantum theory in this space is described by a cft. we

36

can calculate the central charge using (93), (95). the result is

c = 6n1n5

(102)

this is the same value as the one we found in section 4.1.2! in addition, from (96) we
obtain l0 = j = nk, l0 = 0. thus, we get the same description as in the d-brane side.
this is the same unitary cft but we are now at strong coupling. therefore, cardys
formula apply and, (for large black holes, so nk  1) we get correctly (97).

this counting of states generalizes immediately to non-extremal btz black holes [105,
106]8. (from (101) we get l0, l0 in terms of m and j. we also know c from (100).
applying cardys formula we get the bekenstein-hawking entropy formula). a crucial
point is that in order cardys formula to apply we need the cft to be unitary. the
btz black hole, however, induces a liouville theory at spatial innity[108, 109]. this
means that the eective central charge is equal to one[114] instead of c = 2l/3g(3)
n , and
one does not get correctly the bekenstein-hawking entropy formula (see [113] for further
discussion). we argued that for the case we are discussing we have a unitary cft because
of the connection to d-branes. we nd likely that the cft corresponding to the btz is
unitary only when the latter is embedded in string theory.

8a dierent counting of the btz microstates was presented in [107]. there it was used the fact
that three dimensional gravity is topological. the einstein action can be rewritten as a chern-simons
action[110, 111]. a chern-simons theory on a manifold with a boundary induces a wzw model in the
boundary[112]. the degrees of freedom in the boundary are would-be gauge degrees of freedom that
cannot be gauged away because of the boundary. assuming that the horizon is a boundary and imposing
certain boundary condition one gets that the boundary degrees of freedom can account for the black hole
entropy[107]. a problem with this derivation is that some of the states counted have negative norms.
