abstract

some recent ideas are generalized from four dimensions to the general dimension n. two terms of
the trace anomaly in external gravity, the euler density gn and n/21r, are relevant to the problem of
quantum irreversibility. by adding the divergence of a gauge-invariant current, gn can be extended to a
new notion of euler density gn, linear in the conformal factor. we call it pondered euler density. this
notion relates the trace-anomaly coecients a and a of gn and n/21r in a universal way (a = a)
and gives a formula expressing the total rg ow of a as the invariant area of the graph of the beta

function between the xed points. i illustrate these facts in detail for n = 6 and check the prediction to
the fourth-loop order in the 3-theory. the formula of quantum irreversibility for general n even can be
extended to n odd by dimensional continuation. although the trace anomaly in external gravity is zero
in odd dimensions, i show that the odd-dimensional formula has a predictive content.

introduction

the trace anomaly is a useful tool to study non-perturbative properties of quantum eld theory
making use of perturbation theory only. a particularly fruitful arena for this kind of investiga-
tion is the conformal window, where the renormalization-group (rg) ow interpolates between
two conformal eld theories; this interpolation is understood in the sense of the resummation
of the perturbative expansion, even when the interacting xed point is strongly coupled.

embedding the theory in external gravity is particularly convenient to study the rg inter-
polation between the uv and ir values of the so-called central charges, i.e. the coecients c,
a and a of the gravitational invariants appearing in the trace anomaly.

the central charges satisfy positivity conditions and the spectra of anomalous dimensions
obey even stronger restrictions [1, 2], which give non-trivial information about the low-energy
limit of the theory. other inequalities are strictly related to unitarity, such as quantum irre-
versibility, i.e. the statement that auv  air.

in [3] we studied the problem of quantum irreversibility in four dimensions under a new
perspective. a non-perturbative formula expressing the total a-ow as the invariant area of the
graph of the beta function between the xed point comes out naturally. this formula agrees with
perturbation theory up to the fourth-loop order included. moreover, a very natural positivity
property of the induced action for the conformal factor is equivalent to the full a-theorem, i.e.
the inequalities auv  air  0 and the formula for a = auv  air.

precisely, it was explained in [3] that quantum irreversibility is measured by the invariant
area of the graph of the beta function between the xed points. in particular, there exists a
one-form

where f ()  0 is a metric in the space of coupling constants, dened by

 = d () f (),

h(x) (0)i =

in four dimensions (t = ln|x|).  is the trace of the stress-tensor. the ideas of [3] can be
summarized by the formula

a = a =z ir

uv

  0,

(1.2)

saying that the total rg ow of a is the integral of the form  between the xed points.
this statement was checked to the fourth-loop order in the most general renormalizable four-
dimensional theory.

it is therefore interesting to understand whether the new approach extends directly to arbi-
trary dimension, or further obstructions, similar to the conceptual gap between irreversibility
in two- and four-dimensions, make this task less straightforward.

however, the motivation for exploring higher-dimensional eld theories is not purely aca-
demic. the nal aim is to extend the study of quantum irreversibility, well-established in two

2

and four dimensions, to three-dimensional quantum eld theory and phenomena relevant to
condensed matter physics, for instance superconductivity.

the trace anomaly is an intrinsic eect of renormalization, in particular a non-vanishing
beta function [4], and exists in every dimension. for example,  is ()
6! 6 in the 6-theory in
three dimensions. the anomaly begins at two loops instead of one (because odd-loop feynman
graphs do not diverge in odd dimensions), which is the reason why it is not visible as an ordinary
one-loop anomaly.

the trace anomaly operator equation in at space is not sucient in itself to study the
phenomenon of quantum irreversibility. one needs the trace anomaly in the presence of an
external background (gravity in even dimensions) that supports certain invariants (such as
the euler density) and therefore appropriate anomalies, the central charges, in particular the
quantities a and a. there is no such background in odd dimensions. therefore, we do not see
any other way of extending the ideas to odd dimensions than continuing those formulas that
hold in even dimensions. from the formal point of view, this does not present problems. the
coecients to be continued to odd dimensions are indeed very simple functions of the dimension
n. the physical implications, however, are relevant and predictive. i will discuss a situation in
which the odd-dimensional formula can in principle be checked.

this is, in summary, the reason why it is interesting to treat the problem of generic n. i start
by presenting some aspects of the ideas of [3] from the point of view of dierential geometry, to
clarify how the generalization to arbitrary n can be achieved. i stress, however, that the major
source of inspiration for these ideas is physics, actually the interplay between physics and the
mathematical roots of quantum eld theory. many identities could be found only with a major
eort, if they were not inspired by the physical ideas behind them.

for deniteness, in the rst part of the paper i focus on n = 6, or n = 6. several identities
hold for arbitrary n, a fact that is quite important to reduce the number of independent terms
in the regularized theory. a special section is devoted to the generalization of the quantum
irreversibility formula to arbitrary dimension.

the gaussbonnet integrand, or euler density,

g6 =   r

 r

r
 ,

(1.3)

is a non-trivial total derivative, i.e. the total derivative of a non-gauge-invariant current (the
chernsimons form). it is clear, then, that g6 is dened up to trivial total derivatives, i.e. up
to the divergence of a gauge-invariant current. the topological numbers calculated with any
modied gaussbonnet integrand of the form g6 = g6 + j  are exactly the same as those
computed with the ordinary one. the modied integrand, however, can be chosen so as to have
an additional remarkable property, namely to be linear in the conformal factor. the anomaly
equation and the induced action for the conformal factor simplify enormously. the modied
integrand will be called pondered euler density and is meaningful in every even dimension.

this phenomenon is already apparent in four dimensions, where the pondered euler density1

1 in the notation of the present paper g4 is 4 times the gaussbonnet integrand of ref. [3]. see (5.29).

(1.4)

it is not visible, instead, in two dimensions. according to ref. [3] the conceptual gap between
quantum irreversibility in two [5] and four dimensions is lled by the pondered extension of the
euler density. this is the true euler density that should appear in the trace anomaly operator
equation, thereby removing the ambiguities associated with the trivial total derivative terms
appearing in the trace anomaly. the higher-dimensional extension of these ideas requires no
major conceptual innovation, but only a certain amount of technical work.

in higher dimensions the possibility of ne-tuning the coecients of the numerous additional
terms to construct a pondered euler density is even more upsetting than in four dimensions,
in view of the complexity of the expressions.

inspired by these ideas, we have found that in six dimensions the combination

g g6  g [g6 + j 

6 ] = 48 3

(1.5)

is indeed linear in the conformal factor  for conformally at metrics g = e2 , if

we do not need to use the riemann tensor r. we re-express it as a combination of the
ricci tensor r and the scalar curvature r, plus the weyl tensor w. most of our work in
this paper focuses on the trace  of the stress-tensor, coupled to the conformal factor . it is
understood that our formulas are written up to terms proportional to the weyl tensor.

our requirement (1.5) does not seem to x j 

6 uniquely, but leaves a free parameter .
we do not need , since  does not aect the term 2r, but this parameter is the sign of a
redundancy in our list of terms. exploring this issue better, we nd that the combination

hr2  2(n  1)(r r)  2rr + 4(n  1)r

ri

(1.6)

is identically zero on conformally-at metrics in arbitrary dimension n. the fact that this is
true for arbitrary n and not just for n = 6 allows us to consistently reduce the number of terms,
in a regularized theory as well. we choose  = 102

25 , so that

(1.7)

writing gg6 = c , where c  is the chernsimons form, the pondered chernsimons form
reads c  = c  + gj  and g g6 =  c .

in ref. [6] karakhayan et al. have explicitly written a conformal-invariant operator of the
form 3+curvature terms in six dimensions. a similar operator (of the form 2+curvature
terms) exists in four dimensions [7]. it is actually the variation of the pondered euler density

4

with respect to the conformal factor, and it can be read in six dimensions by studying g6 under
a general rescaling g  e2g . g6 can also be derived from the results of ref.
[6], with a
certain amount of work. the pondered euler density is the basic ingredient to write down the
higher-dimensional analogue of the riegert action [7]; it is unique up to terms proportional to
the weyl tensor. in section 5 the expression of g8 is reported.

the notion of pondered euler density relates in a universal way the trace-anomaly coe-
cients of g6 and 2r, which we can call a and a, respectively. it allows us to generalize the
formula of [3], measuring the eect of quantum irreversibility in terms of the area of the graph
of the beta function between the xed points (section 2).

the rest of the paper is organized as follows. after a detailed classication of the curvature
terms occurring in the bare lagrangian and in the trace anomaly (section 3), we check this
prediction to the fourth-loop order in perturbation theory for the 3-theory in six dimensions
(section 4); this is a good opportunity to show that the rg equations produce exactly the
pondered euler density, eliminating step by step the -interaction terms in the trace anomaly.
the a-theorem can indeed be seen as a non-renormalization theorem for the  higher-point
functions. the general formula is extended to arbitrary n in section 5, where the relevance to
odd dimensions is discussed, together with a suggestion for a check.

before beginning the technical study, we make a comment of a general character. quantum
irreversibility is intrinsically related to the beta function, as we have stressed. the beta function
plays a major role in the rg interpolation problem. we recall, for example, that perturbation
theory cannot be applied naively in this context, otherwise fake ambiguities and sometimes
wrong conclusions do arise. there is a well-known scheme change, proposed by t hooft [8],
in which the beta function is just two-loop.
if this were consistent in the rg-interpolation
problem, we could conclude that the 4-theory, say, has a uv interacting xed point, that pure
yangmills theory has no ir xed point, etc. however, the scheme change under investigation
holds only order by order in perturbation theory.

the point is that an apparently harmless power series in  can resum to a function pro-
portional to the inverse of the beta function. an example is the function / in qcd, where
 = d ln /d ln . a scheme change generated by such a function is admissible in the naive
sense, not in our problem, since it spoils a proper interpolation between the xed points. the
moral of the story is that one has to keep track of the orders of  and , not only of the powers
of  2.

the appearance of orders of  can often be rigorously detected and a good approach to the
rg interpolation problem relies on this fact. an illustration is provided precisely by the trace
anomaly, whose existence was rst realized by coleman and jackiw in ref.
[11]. it was later
shown [4] that the general form of the trace anomaly reads  = o, o being a certain operator
(f 2/4 in the case of qed and yangmills theory). while both  and o depend on the scheme,
the invariant content of this equation is precisely that  is of order  around the xed points
and that a scheme change that spoils this property is not admissible. this is in agreement with

2these ideas have been discussed and applied extensively in [9, 10], to which we refer the readers for further

details.

the restored conformal invariance at the xed points.

sometimes, axial anomalies are proportional to the beta function also. in particular, this
applies, in supersymmetric theories, to the divergence of the r-current, which is the supersym-
metric partner of . there is no contradiction with the adlerbardeen theorem, since currents
dierring by o()-terms (we assume that we are working in dimensional regularization) can
well satisfy dierent anomaly equations. in one case the divergence has the form predicted by
the adlerbardeen theorem, in another case it is proportional to the beta function [12].
in
agreement with our observations, the scheme change that interchanges the two anomaly equa-
tions is singular (see for example ref. [13]). the important thing for the applications [10] is to
identify which current is the correct partner of  (this problem has been known for some time
as the anomaly puzzle).

when embedding the theory in external gravity, the careful analysis of [15, 16], which we
are going to use extensively in this paper, identies other places where orders of  appear.
most scheme dependences in the central charges are proportional to the beta function [9] and
therefore do not aect the critical values and the total rg ows. these techniques allow us to
show that the renormalization-group equations select precisely the combination of gravitational
invariants that we have called pondered euler density.

in summary, quantum eld theory denes a natural bre bundle, that we call scheme bundle.
the base manifold is the space of physical correlators and the bre is the space of allowed scheme
choices, with the regularity restriction outlined above. a projection onto the base manifold is
dened and assures scheme independence of the physical correlators. the scheme bundle is
equipped with a metric f and a fundamental one-form , see (1.1). in integrals expressing total
rg ows, such as (1.2), scheme independence is reparametrization invariance. the bundle
admits a proper section (and so a proper beta function and a proper coupling constant),
dened as the scheme choice for which the metric f is constant throughout the rg ow (see
[3] for the detailed construction).

this geometric approach to quantum eld theory is complementary to a similar notion
introduced in [17] for the algorithm of subtraction of divergences in the most general gauge
eld theory. in that case a bre bundle was dened, whose bre was the space of elds and
antields and whose base manifold was, again, the space of physical parameters and correlators.
the removal of divergences was proved to be the direct product of a dieomorphism in the base
manifold and a canonical transformation on the bre. there is a natural structure of connections
and curvatures that helps the generalization of the known theorems of renormalization theory.

(4)3 a g6 + conformal invariants + trivial divergences.

(2.1)

the coecient in front of g6 has been xed by using the results of [18], where the anomaly of
a free scalar eld is computed. we normalize a in such a way that, for a free theory with ns

real scalar elds, nf dirac fermions and nv vector elds, we have

a6 free = ns + f6nf + v6nv.

(2.2)

the relative coecients f6 and v6 of the fermion and vector contributions are not known at
present.

the idea of [3] is that the trivial divergences are xed uniquely by the property (1.5) and
in the end are not so trivial as is commonly assumed, since they produce a precise formula
for the eect of quantum irreversibility. from the point of view of explicit calculations, these
terms contain a certain type of ambiguity, which makes them ill-dened by arbitrary additive
nite bare parameters. the idea of [3] is that, nevertheless, the ambiguities can be consistently
removed in a universal way, writing

with the identication a = a, i.e. with the modied gaussbonnet integrand, the -action
is free at criticality, which means that the three- and higher-point functions of  are zero. in
four dimensions the two-point function h(x) (0)i equals  1
90(42) a2(x). in two dimensions
it is h(x) (0)i =  

using formula (2.4) we see that the quantity a can be expressed at criticality by the integral

(2.5)

we now consider the o-critical theory. we can dene a function a(r) of the intermediate
energy scale 1/r by restricting the integration over a four-sphere s(r, y) of radius r and centred
at the point y, precisely

a(r2)  a(r1) =

for a critical theory we have auv = air = a(r) = a. o-criticality, the running of a(r) is due
to the internal term (e.g. 
3! 3 in the 3-theory) appearing in the expression of . there is a
non-local contribution to the correlator h(x) (y)i,

h(x) (y)i =

for x 6= y,

(2.7)

so that the total ow of the quantity a is non-negative and equal to the invariant area of the
beta function:

auv  air =z +



dt 2(t)f (t) = z ir

uv

d ()f ()  0.

(2.8)

this prediction can be checked to the fourth-loop order in perturbation theory. we will
consider the 3-theory in six dimensions. this theory is not a meaningful physical theory, but
it is the only renormalizable theory in dimension greater than four. it was observed in [3] that
formula (2.8) is expected to work even in the absence of an interacting xed point and can be
consistently checked order by order in perturbation theory whenever the perturbative expansion
makes sense. the price is that we cannot demand that the inequality auv  air, which is the
natural generalization of cardys conjecture [19] to six dimensions, be satised.

in our notation the lagrangian is

z l =z d6x(cid:20) 1

2

(i)2 + 123(cid:21) ,

(2.9)

where i = 1, 2, 3. we choose this form so as to avoid counterterms linear in . we sometimes
compactify the notation by writing l = 1
3! 3, but it should be kept in mind that what
we mean is the theory (2.9).

2 ()2 + 

we follow the procedure of [15], which we generalize to six dimensions. it was explained in
[3] that we do not need, to the order we are interested in, to discuss the non-minimal term r2
in the extension of (2.9) to curved space. the two-loop beta function is [20]

() =

(4)3

(4)6 + o(7)  13 + 25 + o(7).

the theory is formally asymptotically free. we have  = ()123 and therefore

f =

76
24 |x|12 (h1(x) 1(0)i)3 =

7

24(4)3 ,

since the -propagator is h(x) (0)i = 1/ = 1/(43) 1/|x|4.

as was explained in ref. [3], our formula predicts the a-ow even in the absence of a rigorous
xed point. however, in order to achieve this goal, we have to pretend that a xed point does
indeed exist. this can be done as follows. we write () = 23(2  2
ir) +o(7) and pretend
that 2
ir = 1/2 is a small parameter. in other words, we consider 1 as an independent,
small parameter, and replace it with 22
ir everywhere. this procedure is unambiguous as

8

long as we can keep track of the orders of , not only the orders of , as explained in the
introduction. we will see that there is enough information to carry this over to the end. of
course, there would be no such nuisance in the presence of a true zero of the beta function.

we therefore have, to the lowest order:

note that the check of a is independent of the value afree = 3, which we took from [18].
this value is needed to normalize a conventionally, but hathrells techniques, which we extend
here to six dimensions, give the ow a directly and are actually incapable of predicting the
value afree. we stress again that the rst relevant radiative correction is fourth-loop in our case,
while it is generically third-loop in four dimensions.

3 classication of the curvature terms

in this section we discuss the general structure of the trace anomaly and the bare lagrangian.
a detailed introduction to the subject can be found in ref. [21].

the conformal-invariant terms are four. two terms are cubic in the weyl tensor,

a1 = ww w 
 ,

a2 = ww w



.



a third term has the form

a3 = ww  + 

(3.1)

and is directly related to the central extension c of the ope algebra (see [9] for details):

ht (x) t(0)i = cy(2)

,

|x|6(cid:19) ,
(cid:18) 1

, being the spin-2 projector (see for example [22]). to

see this, we use the relations

t denoting the stress-tensor andq(2)
 z ,
g (x)g (0)z (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

so that

,

(x)

and therefore   ca3 + rest. the central-extension term reads w n/22w  +  in
generic even dimension n > 2.

the complete form of a3 that can be found in the literature (for example, in ref. [6], formula
(2.18)) is not explicitly proportional to the weyl tensor. this is because a spurious contribution
proportional to g6 is included. it is easy to see, however, that subtracting this term away, a3
can be re-expressed in a form that is proportional to the weyl tensor (see for example [14]).
this fact shows that a3 is negligible for our purposes, as well as a1 and a2.

in conclusion, there is only one term that is relevant to our analysis, and this is g6.
the most general bare lagrangian contains in the gravity sector the following terms

lb = abg6 + bbrrr + cbr3 + dbrr + ebr r,

(3.2)

where g6 (1.3) is continued to dimension n as

12r rr

 +

9n
n  1

rrr 

3(n2 + 4n  4)
4(n  1)2 r3 + o(w ),

and terms proportional to the weyl tensor w , irrelevant to our analysis, are omitted.

in the above list, there is one redundancy, as a reection of the property noted in (1.6) at

the level of total derivatives. indeed the combination

(3.3)

is identically zero on conformally at metrics, in arbitrary dimension d. therefore we consis-
tently remove the parameter eb in (3.2). the derivative of the above expression (integrated
over the space-time) with respect to the conformal factor is (n  6) times the same expression.
for this reason, it is negligible for our purposes.

in the end we remain with g6 and the three terms

rrr,

r3,

rr,

(3.4)

10

at the level of the bare lagrangian. all the other terms are either proportional to the weyl
tensor or total derivatives in n dimensions and can therefore be omitted. the three terms
(3.4) are forbidden at criticality, since their integrals are not conformal-invariant in n = 6.
o-criticality, they do appear, but their coecients, proportional to the beta function, will be
related to ab in a way that we have to uncover (and that should, in particular, agree with our
prediction a = a). there is some surviving ambiguity, actually, since bb, cb and db can be
shifted by arbitrary additive constants.

the same three terms appear, multiplied by (n  6), in the trace anomaly equation. more-

over, four independent total-derivative terms,

(r r ),

r2,

(rr),

2r,

(3.5)

appear at the level of the trace anomaly , with coecients related to the coecients ab, bb,
cb and db (the coecients of these terms in  do not come multiplied by (n  6)).

it is worth recalling that in four dimensions we have the terms g4 and r2 at the level
of the bare lagrangian, g4, r2 and r at the level of the trace anomaly. the integrability
condition requires that the coecient of r2 in the renormalized lagrangian be proportional to
the beta function and so vanish at criticality. the coecient of r in  is directly related to
the coecient of r2.

4 perturbative calculation

in this section i apply hathrells techniques to the 3-theory in six dimensions, following the
notation of [15] (turned to the euclidean framework) as close as possible in order to facilitate
the reading. there are nevertheless unavoidable complications due to the large number of
invariants. i take the opportunity, in the derivation, to stress the points that are related to the
notion of pondered euler density introduced in this paper.

an indication in favour of the pondered euler density is already visible, to all orders in
perturbation theory, in the expression of .
indeed, we see that the four total-derivative
terms of the kind (3.5) are multiplied by three independent coecients only. this integrability
condition must be compatible with the relationships between the coecients of the pondered
euler density. the crucial test is the ratio between the factors of (r r ) and (rr),
which equals 5/4 for n = 6 in . the same ratio appears in the expression (1.7) of j . the
remaining factors can be checked only after lengthy work, which we now report on.

the renormalized eld  is dened by

can shift b  b + z1

therefore we write

b is renormalized in the same way as 2

b = ( + l)z1

where the pole part l does not depend on . in curved space the most general expression for

+(l(2) + 2l(2) + 32l(2))r2 +(l(3) + 2l(3))r] ,

(4.2)

where the pole series l,, have the same form as l. the -dependences follow from the
requirement of niteness of h[2]i in curved space. for example, we observe that

1
g


h[2]i = h [2]i +

12

1

g(cid:28) 



[2](cid:29) = (nite).

(4.3)

we can take the at-space limit and observe that h [2]i(cid:12)(cid:12) is linear in , which implies that
to at space. repeating the above argument, we observe that h  [2]i(cid:12)(cid:12) contains the term

the coecient of the curvature term r in [2] is linear in . the terms rr and r2
contribute to the second derivative of h[2]i with respect to the conformal factor , projected
2 h[2] [2] [2]i. this term, however, does not aect r r and therefore the coecient
of rr is linear in , while the coecient r2 can be quadratic in .

we proceed by observing that the insertion s

 must produce nite results in correlators of

elementary elds. we have

we can therefore write, by using (4.2) and equating the various independent pole terms,

ab = n6(a + la),
cb = n6(c + lc + l(2) + 2l(2) + 3l(2)),

bb = n6(b + lb + l(1) + 2l(1)),
db = n6(d + ld + l(3) + 2l(3)),

a, b, c and d denoting nite independent parameters, while la,b,c,d etc. are pole series in  of
the same form as l.

4.2 the renormalization-group equations

finite and pole parts are related by the condition



d
dlb = 0,

(4.4)

in particular, the ambiguities related to the addition of arbitrary nite local terms (3.4) to
the action are almost completely xed. finite local terms add, unchanged, to the one-particle
irreducible eective action  and aect  via the total derivatives of the list (3.5). this kind

of ambiguity does not concern ab, since the -variation of r g6 is zero in six dimensions (see
the appendix). moreover, these additions have to preserve (4.4) and therefore cannot depend
on the renormalized coupling constant . more precisely, if bb  bb + bn6 with b nite, we
have in the limit n = 6,  db
 = 0. the shift b can thus depend on the coupling constant
only in families of conformal eld theories ( = 0), such as n=4 supersymmetric yangmills
theory. this case, however, does not concern us here. similar conclusions apply to cb and db.

we have compressed the formulas in a self-evident notation. we recall that a1, b1, etc., are the
simple poles of the various counterterms.

at a rst reading, the reader can follow the various steps focusing on the quantity a. the
rest is entirely analogous, with the complication due to the renormalization mixing with the
operator 2.

4.3 the composite operator 

3

the analysis of the composite operator 2 has to be repeated for 3, by studying the insertions
of s
 in correlators. actually, this procedure produces the integral of the renormalized operator
[3], rather than [3] itself. therefore [3] is obtained up to arbitrary total-derivative terms of
the form (3.5) and [2], multiplied by pole series that we write as

1

n  6(cid:16)f (1,2,3,4) + lf (1,2,3,4) + (g(1,2,3,4) + lg(1,2,3,4) ) + (cid:17)

respectively, f (1,2,3,4), g(1,2,3,4), etc., and e denoting nite functions. the result for 1
as well as details of the calculation, are given in the appendix, formula (6.36).

and the consistency relations (6.38) implied by niteness. other remarkable relations are ob-
tained by applying the operator 1d  to [3]. the operator 1d  has the property that it
produces nite quantities when acting on nite quantities. re-expressing [3] in terms of 
and using d = 0, niteness implies the important relations (6.38).

we are now ready to study the lowest-order contributions to some functions. the anomalous
dimension  of [2] is clearly o(2). the quantity e/ is the lowest-order pole of the mixing
between [3] and [2], and is o(3). therefore e = o(4). the rst equation of the list (6.38)
gives  = o(6). formula (4.5) gives 1() = o(6) also.
according to the denition (6.36) of [3], the quantity f (3)/ is the rst pole of the mixing
between [3] and  (via 2r). in particular,

(nite) =



h[3]i = h[3]i +* 1
g

[3]+ .




1
g

projecting this equation to at space, we see that the pole f (3)/ is cancelled by the rst pole
of h[3]i. this is at least o(3), as we now show, so that we expect f (3) = o(4).

in at space, the operator (x) reads

| = 


3!

[3](n6)/2 +(cid:18) n

2  1 + (cid:19) [e]  (e + (n  1))[2].

we recall that  = o(3), while e = o(4). moreover, we can write  = 1
2 (n 6) +  = o(3).
indeed, the term proportional to (n  6) selects a higher-loop singularity, and we can formally

say that (n  6) is o(2). finally,  = o(2), but we can neglect the term in [e] in he(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) [3]i,

since a simple functional argument shows that h[e] pi = 0 for any operator p. we have thus
proved that f (3) = o(4). there is, however, a cancellation between the two-loop contribution
2 (n  6) in  and the one-loop contribution coming from . this
singled out by the term 
enhancement, which produces the result that f (3) is actually o(6), will be proved in the next
section. precisely, it will be proved that d = o(8). then the claimed result follows from the
fth formula from the bottom of the list (6.38).
we now consider the quantity g(3)/. we can repeat the above analysis and consider
the -term in |. the pole g(3)/ cancels the rst pole of h[3] []2i, which is o(). so,
g(3) = o(2). no enhancement takes place here.

15

before closing this section,

moreover, the fourth formula of (6.38) from the bottom implies that (3) = o(4). the
same result can be proved, using formula (4.3) projected to at space and the denition (4.2)
of [2]: (3)
is the rst-loop pole of h[3] [2]i. taking the -term, a similar argument proves
1
that (3) = o(1). similar considerations show that f (1,2,4) = o(6), g(1,2,4) = o(2), (1,2) =
o(4), (1,2) = o(1).

let us discuss the parameter  in detail,

in particular the
renormalization-group equation d =  + . writing,  = u() + v(), we have d = 0,
and for n = 6, u()  1/1 (where  = 12 + o(4),  = 13 + o(5)) and v() = o(4).
the parameter  is the true independent coupling constant of the term r2 in the lagrangian
and can be set to zero. a non-zero value of this parameter would produce non-integer powers
of  and therefore the choice  = 0 is universal. this can be better apppreciated by observing
that the solution for u() reads

u() = exp z 

0

 ()
()

d! .

the arbitrariness of 0 is the same as the arbitrariness of . now, u() is not proportional to
the beta function, so  contains a term u()[2]. to restore scale invariance at the xed
points,  should be proportional to the beta function, up to eld equations. therefore we have
to set  = 0. the remaining [2]-term is indeed proportional to the beta function, since using
the rst relation of (6.38) the coecient of the [2]-term in  reads

e + (n  1) = (n  1)







.


observe that 1
 is regular also in the free-eld limit. for a generic interacting xed point,

 > 0. we conclude that only the choice  = 0 is consistent with the rg interpolation
problem. at a criticality we have, correctly,

| =(cid:18) n

2  1 + (cid:19) [e] ,

 being the anomalous dimension of the elementary eld .

4.4 the  two-, three- and four-point function

we now explain the basic reason why the pondered euler density comes out naturally of the
calculation. it is convenient to dene

we study the rst, second and third derivatives of , which are related to the two-, three-

and fourth-point functions of e itself. the derivatives of a nite quantity, like h i, are nite.

therefore we have, for example,

(4.9)

hei



= he ei +(cid:28) 



(cid:29) = (nite).

16

first, we can work out relations between the poles. then, using the rg equations, we can
obtain information about the nite parts.

the two-point function xes the order of the rst radiative correction to the coecient d,

in particular the coecient d1 of the rst-pole term.

let us dene

so that equation (4.9) can be re-expressed as

2  1(cid:19) e,

we can neglect the term in [e] in he i, since h[e] pi = 0 for any p. we have

[2].

the operator q is particularly useful. it contains poles, but we will see that they are harmless,
since they multiply just the eld equations. an important property of q is d( q) = 0 in at
space.

we recall that ,  = o(3), while e,  = o(4),  = o(2). naively, we expect d1 = o(6).
we now prove that there is an enhancement due to the rg equations and d1 = o(8). this
phenomenon is similar to a phenomenon occurring in four dimensions [15], but here is implies
that the rst radiative corrections to the quantity a are four-loop, rather than three-loop. we
write the poles of the two-point function as

hq(x) q(0)i = n6  n  6
 !2

lx 3(x) + (nite),

(4.11)

where lx is a pole series of the usual form. the divergent terms are local, since subdivergences
are originated only from vertex graphs of elementary elds and at most one insertion of q.
therefore they are automatically subtracted away.

we see that the rst pole x1 is, by denition, o(2). writing x1 = x12 we nd by explicit

computation

formula (4.10) gives

x1 =

eration does not come just from ld, but from the full sum ld + l(3) + 2l(3) appearing in
the denition of db given in section 4.1. the -contributions are indeed o(8) also.

we can compute x3 as follows. we apply 2d 2 to (4.11) and observe that 2d 2(nite) =

(nite). moreover, we recall that d( q) = 0. we have, therefore:

purely local. (4.14) can be written in the schematic form

e

applying 3d 3 and using d 

 = 0 we can prove an rg equation similar to (4.12) and
show that there is an enhancement again. this would be straightforward in the absence of the
subtractions just mentioned. the result is that one nds an equation of the type (4.12), but
with a non-zero right-hand side. it is easy to see, however, by direct inspection of the structure
and graphs of (4.17), that these corrections are of higher order (o(4) for y1, o(6) for y2,
etc. up to o(10) for y4) and we do not need any enhancement to discard these. this fact is
actually natural, since subdivergences cannot contribute to the lowest orders, which is all what
we are interested in here. in four dimensions the matter is entirely similar [15, 16]. we also
remark, without giving further details, that there is one peculiar local structure which is not
aected by non-local subdivergences. this is not sucient, however, for us, since we need two
conditions. for this reason we are compelled to inspect the subdivergences originated vertices
with two q-legs in the same point. the matter is simpler for the four-point function, where
there is one special local structure and we need precisely one condition.

a direct inspection of (4.17) proves that to the lowest order y1 = o(2), so that the rg
equations imply y2 = o(4) and y3 = o(6) and one naively expects y4 = o(8). the
enhancement xes instead y4 = o(10).
to help studying y1 we observe that

q


=

(6  n)q + terms.

the -terms are of order o(), at least, quadratic in , and also contain poles. the important
fact is that q/ is of higher order with respect to q. finally, in q the eld equation e
is multiplied by / , which is formally o(/(n  6)). let us note that h[e][e][e]i = 0, which
follows from (4.16).
now, y1 = o(2) means a simple pole in (4.17) of order 1/. this can be originated,
indeed, by the denominator 1/ , but it is easy to check that contributions worse tan this (nite
or divergent, local or non-local) simply do not exist in (4.17).

we conclude the analysis of the three-point function by stating that

(y)(z)+(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
* 2e(x)

= (nite),

(4.18)

to the order 8. in particular, we study the simple poles of (4.18) and set them to zero. these
are linear combinations of b1, c1 and d1 (see below). because of the one-to-one correspondence

between pole terms and nite terms, it is like setting the nite part of

this is the rst step for the denition of the pondered euler density.

that we have applied for the two- and three-point functions and keeping into account that,
despite there are disconnected contributions, they sum up to nite terms and can therefore be
neglected throughout. indeed, the disconnected contributions to (4.19) read in at space

this is the form of the simple poles. we now show that the nite parts (as well as the other
poles) are related in a similar way. formula (4.23) is the analogue of the identication a = a
of ref. [3].

we compare the radiative correction to the coecient a of g6 with the prediction (2.10).

we recall that

according to (4.6). the same renormalization-group equations (4.6) give

recalling the procedure with which d1 was calculated, this result shows the direct relation-
ship between the coecient of the euler density (which contributes to the  four-point function,
since it is cubic in the riemann tensor) and the  two-point function, in agreement with the
ideas of [3]. this relationship in non-trivial and would not be naively expected to hold. only
when analysing the induced eective action for the conformal factor does one uncover that a
very simple positivity property is actually equivalent to the claimed relationship to all-orders
in perturbation theory [3]. however, we stress that the positivity arguments of [3] are more
naturally applicable in dimensions multiple of four, although it is not excluded that there exists
a modied version valid in all even dimensions.

we now comment on the remaining terms of (4.26). the terms of the list (3.4) should
be proportional to the beta function, by the integrability condition, while the terms of the
list (3.5) should reconstruct g6, as in (4.24). however, this is not straightforward, due to
the renormalization mixing betwen  and [2]. having already obtained the desired result,
namely (4.26), we will not pursue this matter further. nevertheless, we conclude this section
by showing that, consistently with what we have just said, there would be no trouble in the
absence of the [2]-mixing. in this case, the equations reported in the appendix (as well as our
discussion so far) would simplify enormously: , e, , (1,2,3), (1,2,3), (2), g(1,2,3,4), h(1,2,4)  0.
we are left with a, b, c, d and f (1,2,3,4), related via an oversimplied version of (6.38) and (4.6),
namely  for n = 6 

5b =

10d =






f (1),

f (3),

2b + 15c + d =




f (2),

4b =




f (4),

d(b, c, d) = 

(b, c, d)



= b,c,d.

(4.27)

we see that b,c,d, coecients of the terms (3.4) in , are proportional to the beta function, in
agreement with the integrability condition. the coecients of the terms (3.5),

(f (1)+10b)r r(cid:16)f (2) + 4b + 30c + 2d(cid:17) r2(f (3)+20d)2r(f (4)+8b)(rr),

can be found by repeating the above procedure for a. we have, using (4.27),

1
2





n2h10br r + (4b + 30c + 2d)r2 + 20d2r + 8b(rr)io .

now, (4.6) gives also equations that are analogous to (4.25):

b

(cid:16)2c1(cid:17) ,

therefore, the relations (4.22) and (4.23) between a2 and b1, c1, d1 are promoted to similar
relations between a1 and b, c, d (up to the usual additive constants), so that, in turn, (4.26) is
promoted to

we now discuss the case of generic n. the pondered euler density has the form

(5.28)

the dots stand for a list of trivial total derivative terms, which are at least quadratic in the
curvature tensor. the weights of the various terms in the list are chosen in such a way that on
conformally-at metrics

g gn = 2(n  1)pn

n

2 .

only the coecient pn in (5.28) is relevant to quantum irreversibility and the denition of gn
makes it easily calculable. we plan to devote a separate paper to the general mathematical
constrution of gn.

the computation of pn proceeds as follows. the euler characteristic of an n-dimensional

we are ready to write the general formula for the a-ow. we normalize a in such a way

the two-point function reads

3n

(5.30)

using 

n

2 |x|n = n (2n  2)!!.

it would be desirable to have the values of an for free elds in arbitrary dimension (only a
few cases have been treated, so far, for n > 4) and normalize an so that it equals 1 for a real
scalar eld, and reads in general

ns + fnnf + vnnv

(5.31)

for free-eld theories.

the odd-dimensional formula of quantum irreversibility that we propose is obtained by

putting n =odd in (5.30). for example,

auv  air =

1

1442z d3x|x|3 h(x) (0)i

in three dimensions. the normalization (5.31), as well as the free-eld values of a, can be
extended to odd dimensions in the same way. this recipe denes the a-function in odd dimen-
sions. the value of a for an interacting odd-dimensional conformal eld theory connectible to
a free-eld theory by an rg ow is dened by formula (5.30) itself.

this prescription has a predictive content. it can be checked, in principle, in the case of an
rg ow interpolating between two free-eld theories, where auv
n can be worked out in
two independent ways: the evaluation of (5.30) and the continuation of the free-eld value of
a, for example (5.31).

n  air

there is no known odd-dimensional example of an rg ow between two free-eld theories.
its existence is plausible, however, since four-dimensional situations of this type are known, for
example the lower bound of the conformal window in supersymmetric qcd, which, according
to non-abelian electricmagnetic duality [23], is manifestly free in a dual formulation.

6 conclusions

a pondered notion of euler density g, linear in the conformal factor, is naturally singled
out by the radiative corrections to the trace anomaly in external gravity and is relevant to
the phenomenon of quantum irreversibility, measured by the invariant area of the graph of the
beta function between the xed points. the existence of g is a support to the ideas of ref.
[3]. formulas for arbitrary even dimension have been derived, and detailed calculations in six
and eight dimensions have been performed to check the predictions. a natural, predictive,
odd-dimensional formula has been proposed by dimensional continuation.

our expression for a can be checked order by order in perturbation theory, even when
there is no interacting xed point. here, the 3-theory in six dimensions has been considered in
detail. complications are due to the large number of invariants, as well as the renormalization
mixing between the operators 3 and 2. in higher dimensions it is possible to test these ideas
using higher-derivative renormalizable eld theories as a laboratory. we recall, anyway, that the
idea of quantum irreversibility is meaningful in complete generality, even if the theory is non-
renormalizable, provided that the intrinsic rg running of the coupling constants is isolated (in
a way to be uncovered) from the spurious eects of dimensioned parameters [3]. the inequality
auv  air might be violated, since higher-derivative theories are not unitary, but formula (5.30)
should hold, at least if suitable positivity restrictions are imposed on the classical action.

appendix

i report in this appendix some useful formulas, starting from the expressions of the curvature
tensors in a conformally at metric,

g = e2

in which it is used. the conformal variations needed in the paper are

the renormalized operator [3] is obtained starting from the nite insertions of s

 in cor-

relators. we describe here some relevant aspects of the procedure.

there is an important preliminary observation to make. when taking the -derivative of
the action s, we can omit any nite term and keep just the poles. indeed, nite additional
contributions to [3] (having a correct power expansion in ) do not aect the result that we
need, since they appear multiplied by n  6 in .

moreover, we have to omit nite terms such as a

 rrr , etc., but for a dierent
reason. although they are nite (and therefore do not change the pole part of the renormalized
operator), the expressions a
 , etc., do not have an ordinary power expansion in  [15] and
cannot appear in the denition of [3]. the reason is readily explained. from (4.6) we see that
a satises the equation

 g6, b

+

n  6
2



(cid:16)2a(cid:17) = a().

(6.34)

a power expansion for a(), assured by our arguments, excludes a power expansion for a. this
is not a contradiction in the derivation, but an important property of the functions appearing
in the induced eective action for the external gravitational background. the expressions in
question do not appear in , nor in the induced action projected onto conformally at metrics.
a more direct explanation of this matter is obtained by considering (6.34) for n = 6: we see
that a
 contains a denominator 1/ and we run into the problems described in the introduction.
such terms cannot appear in the expression of [3]. once this observation is kept in mind, there
is no further obstruction to correctly identify the renormalized operator [3].

we have therefore, using the rg equations of section 4.2,

this analysis xes only the integrated renormalized operator and so we can add arbitrary

studying the renormalization-group equation of [3]. the possible local terms are (3.5) plus
[2]. we write their coecients as shown in eq. (4.7).
