abstract: we describe a general method for calculating the infra-red limit of physi-
cal quantities in unitary quantum eld theories. using analyticity of green functions
in a complex scale parameter, the infra-red limit is expressed as a contour integral
entirely in the ultra-violet region. the infra-red limit is shown to be the limit of the
borel transform of the physical quantity. the method is illustrated by calculating
the central charge of the perturbed unitary minimal models and the critical expo-
nents of 4 theory in three dimensions. we obtain approximate values for the central
charge which are very close to the exact values using only a one loop perturbative
calculation. for 4 theory we obtain estimates which are within the errors of other
more elaborate approaches.

1. introduction and summary

it is important to get a better understanding of the infra-red limit of quantum eld
theory. conventionally this is studied by extrapolating perturbation theory from
the ultra-violet using the renormalisation group. the purpose of this paper is to
show how to augment this approach with information derived from the analyticity
properties of green functions. these properties are well-known. for example, the
kallen-lehmann spectral representation of the two-point function of a scalar eld
shows that it has an analytic continuation to the complex momentum plane. we will
use this to express the infra-red limit as an integral in the ultra-violet region where
perturbation theory is applicable. for illustration assume that the physical quantity
f depends on some distance scale s, and that f (s) is analytic in the complex plane
with the negative axis cut away, then the contour integral

vanishes, where the contour c is given in gure 1. this means that we can write the
infra-red limit fir = lim|s| f (s) as an integral

fir =

over the innitesimal circle c0 and the cut c1.

we show below that the integral over the cut c1 vanishes for large , so that the
infra-red limit fir then is given as an integral in the uv region over c0 where per-
turbation theory applies. we call this integral i() and get that fir = lim i().

i() is shown to be the borel transform of f (s) of order k, where k is related to
the way we analytically continue in the complex scale parameter. the borel trans-
form has also been applied to perturbation theory in [26] where the borel transform
in the coupling is used. in this case assumptions (justied by details of the dynam-
ics) have to be made about the poles of the borel transform. the essential dierence
compared with our approach is that we transform with respect to the scale parame-
ter. the analytic properties of green functions, which are needed to dene the borel
transform, in this case follow directly from general principles of quantum eld theory.
we will use this method on two examples where the infra-red limit of the physical
quantity f (s) in question is well known, namely the central charge of the unitary
minimal models perturbed by the relevant eld (1,3), and the critical exponents of
4 theory in three dimensions.

we also considered the perturbed minimal models in [1] where this method was
shown to improve upon renormalisation group improved perturbation theory by a
factor 2. f (s) is given as the two point function of the energy momentum tensor,
and we will here address some of the details left out of our discussion in [1]. we rst
show the analytic properties of f (s), and we then obtain a bound on the exact non
perturbative expression for i(), and this allows us to obtain an approximate value
for calculating the central charge.

we employ this approximation method to calculate the central charge for the free
fermionic and bosonic theories perturbed by a mass term and the unitary minimal
models perturbed by the relevant operator (1,3). the free massive theories can be
solved exactly and these then demonstrate how i() behaves in an exact case. for
the perturbed minimal models we rst calculate f (s) as a renormalisation group
improvement of a one loop perturbative calculation and show that this expression
has the correct limit when m  , where m characterises the minimal model.
we then show how our method improves upon the perturbative renormalisation
group result. if we use the largest domain of analyticity for f (s) apparent from the
spectral decomposition there is something of a surprise. the approximation becomes
dramatically close to the exact value, which is remarkable as it is only based on one
loop perturbation theory.

the other example is 4 theory in three dimensions, where we calculate the
critical exponents  and . 4 theory has been shown to be borel summable of
order one in the perturbative expansion in the coupling constant. the perturbative
series will often at most be asymptotic, if for example a theory is ill dened for
negative couplings the convergence radius will be zero. the question is then if the
perturbative series captures all of the physics when it is only asymptotic. this
will depend on the analytic properties of the correlators, and if the theory is borel
summable perturbation theory will contain all information about the theory. we use
the propagator to dene functions f, f which have the critical exponents  and 
as their infra-red limit. all scale dependence is moved into the coupling using the

2

running coupling so that f(s) and f(s) are given as asymptotic series in the scale
parameter s, and we show their analyticity. in this example the actual calculation
of the physical quantities  and  is dierent form the minimal models case, as
we cannot use the same approximation. the reason is that in this case we use
higher order perturbative expressions (5,6 and 7 loops) and one cannot nd an exact
expression for the perturbative running coupling (unlike the one loop case). the
infra-red values for ,  are therefore obtained from the limiting value of the borel
transform, and to calculate this we use a conformal mapping and pade approximation
which is done in the appendix. the estimates we obtain for ,  are within the errors
of other more elaborate approximations.

the main results are that we can use analyticity in the scale parameter to express
the infra-red physics as an integral in the ultra-violet region, the infra-red limit is
then obtained taking the limit in the borel transformed quantity. we show how this
works in two examples with well known infra-red limits.

the outline is as follows: in the next section we will discuss analyticity of cor-
relators, introduce the contour integral giving the infra-red limit and show that the
contribution from the cut vanishes for large . we also show that the contour integral
is the borel transform of f (s). in section 3 we dene f (s) for the central charge,
show its analyticity and discuss an approximation method for calculating the central
charge. an exact bound on i() is given. in section 4 we use this approximation
on the free massive bosonic and fermionic theory together with the minimal models
perturbed by (1,3). in section 5 we discuss the 4 theory and introduce a function
giving the critical exponents ,  in the infra-red limit, and obtain estimates of  and
 from the limit of the borel transform.

2. dening the contour integral

the physical quantities of a quantum eld theory can be written in terms of green
functions which have well known analyticity properties. as an example consider the
two point function of a scalar eld a(p). the kallen-lehmann spectral representation
writes this as a sum over intermediate states

where d2c(2) is the spectral density. introducing the complex scale factor s  c

then shows that ha(sp)a(0)i is analytic in the positive half-plane (s) > 0.

generally physical quantities will not be analytic in the positive half-plane but

in some sector s() of the complex plane, dened as

s() = {z = rei | 0 < r < ,  

2 <  < 

2 }.

note that 0 / s(). we want to calculate the infra-red limit fir of a physical
quantity f (x), where fir = lim|x| f (x), and we will denote the uv limit fu v =
lim|x|0 f (x). we are considering functions which have well dened limits in s(),
i.e. lim|s| f (s) = fir and lims0 f (s) = fu v for s  s().

in the two examples we will consider the physical quantities f (x) are given as
functionals of a two point correlator resulting in analytic functions f (s). a large
class of physical quantities will in this way preserve the analytic structure of the
green functions in the theory.

the scale parameter s can of course be introduced into the physical quantity in
a number of ways. we will dene by f (s) the analytical continuation of f (x) where

s is introduced as f (s)  f (sx)|x=1 so that f (s) has the expansion f (s) =p fnsn

around the origin, and f (s) is analytic in s(). choosing another positive power
f (sx)|x=1,  > 0, gives the same ultra-violet and infra-red limits, but dierent
intermediate behaviour. let us now introduce the scale parameter so that the opening
of the analytic sector is 2(  ) with   1. f (s) = f (sa) is analytic in s =
s(2(  )) provided that a = 
2() . we will now express the infra-red limit as an
integral entirely in the ultra-violet region using analyticity.

using cauchys theorem the analyticity of f (s) implies that the contour integral

the integrand in this integral is damped by the factor e/|s|, and we will show that
lim cut() = 0 by showing that it is bounded by a nite integral for all  allowing
us to take the limit    in the integrand. we substitute s = rei() for points

(2.7)

for a general f (s) where the fall o might be slower we keep a nite rir then |cutir|
is again nite for all  and a nite rir introduces a o( 1

rir
negligible for rir large. as   1 we can replace

on the right hand side in (2.3) which is again negligible for small . we can then

(2.8)

so that fir = lim iir() and we have succeeded in writing the infra-red limit as
the limiting value of a contour integral in the ultra-violet region.

we will now use cauchys theorem again to rewrite iir() and this will show
that iir() is the borel transform of f (s). instead of integrating over c0 we will

5

integrate over c given as the path from the origin along the ray arg(s) =  +  and
then anti-clockwise along |s| = x > 0 until arg(s) =   and then back to the origin.
it follows that this contour integral is independent of the choice of x and  as long
as  <  < 
2 . the upper limit ensures that the rays stay in the negative half-plane
(where e/s is a damping factor), and the lower limit that f (s) is analytic on the
contour. using this contour the ultra-violet limit ru v  0 can be taken explicitly
by extending the rays to the origin.

using that f (s) = f (sa) for a =

equation (2.9) then shows that iir() is the borel transform of f (s) of order k

[16]. the borel transform of order k of a formal power series h(z) =pn hnzn is given
by bk(h)() =pn

s e1/ssn
it then follows that (2.9) is the borel transform of order k of f (s) by inserting a series
expansion for f (s).

the contour integral in (2.9) is independent of the contour c , i.e. in the choice
of  for   (0,   2). this shows that equation (2.9) holds for all k with f (s) 
f (s1/k) and  > /k, because we can always nd an  > 0 so that  > ( + )/k,
which again implies that c   s() and | arg(/s)k| > /2 which again makes the
contour integral well dened.

we have then shown that: the infra-red limit of a physical quantity, fir, is the
limiting value of the borel transform of f (s), and changing the way in which the
scale parameter is introduced amounts to changing the order of the borel transform.
the order k has to satisfy the bound  > /k where  determines the analytic sector
of the physical quantity f (s).

one way of calculating the contour integral in (2.9) is to insert a series expansion
of f (s) around the origin, but because f (s) is only analytic in a sector this series
can only be an asymptotic expansion of f (s) 1. an analytic function has a unique
asymptotic expansion, but an asymptotic series might be the asymptotic expansion
of several analytic functions. however in the case where a function is analytic in a

1if f (z) is an analytic function in a neighbourhood of the origin it follows that its asymptotic
series around the origin is convergent and equal to the power series of f (z); the lack of analyticity

at the origin forces the asymptotic series to diverge. a formal power series f (z) = p fnzn is

asymptotic of order k if  c, k > 0 : |fn| < ck n(1 + n/k), this shows that the borel transform
of order k, of such a series, has a non zero convergence radius.

sector of opening  > 
k , which is the situation we have above, the map between the
analytic function and the asymptotic series of order k is injective (but not surjective)
[16]. this means that all information about the exact function is contained in the
asymptotic series.

f (s, g) = pn

an asymptotic series of f (s) in the scale parameter can be obtained doing the
perturbative expansion in the coupling and then inserting the running coupling con-
stant. assume that f is given as a formal perturbative series, which we write as
fn(s)gn. the callan-symanzik equation states that a theory is in-
variant, i.e. the correlators are invariant, under a scale transformation if the cou-
plings change according to the renormalisation group. a scaled quantum eld the-
ory can therefore equivalently be described by a theory on the same scale, but with
couplings changed according to the renormalisation group.
in this way scale de-
pendence of a theory can be moved into the running coupling g(s). moving all
scale dependence into the running coupling we get an asymptotic series in the scale

f (s = 1, g(s)) =p fnsn 2.

the examples we consider below have  =   , where   1, hence from the
constraint  > 
k : k = 1 +  for some  > 0. we will generally try to minimise the
order k (k  1), thus maximising the analytic sector and the convergence of the
borel transform.

3. dening f (s) for the central charge

as the rst example we want to calculate the infra-red central charge of a 2 dimen-
sional unitary quantum eld theory. the renormalisation group ow of the central
charge is governed by zamolodchikovs c-theorem [4]. this states that for a uni-
tary and renormalisable quantum eld theory in 2 dimensions there exists a function
which is monotonically decreasing along the renormalisation group ow, and which is
stationary only for conformally invariant theories where it takes the value of the vi-
rasoro central charge. the c-theorem implies that the infra-red limit, where the scale
goes to innity, and the ultra-violet limit, where the scale vanishes, are xed points
of the renormalisation group.
in 2 dimensions scale invariance implies conformal
invariance so in these scaling limits we have a conformal eld theory characterised
by the central charge. we dene the energy-momentum tensor as in [2]

ht(x)i =

w [g]
g ,

(3.1)

2v

pg(x)

where v = vol(sn1) = 2 in 2d and w [g] is the eective action.

2if f (s) is asymptotic of order k ( f (s)  c[[s]]1/k ) we will choose k = k, and then the borel
transform of f has a non-zero convergence radius and the analytically continued value at innity
uniquely determines fir. the analytical continuation can be done by a conformal mapping, we
will discuss this in the appendix.

the correlator htzz(z)tzz(0)i gives the ultra-violet and infra-red central charges
in the limits z  0 and z   respectively. in [2] ht(x)t(0)i was written using
the kallen-lehmann spectral representation:

3.1 analyticity of f (s)
we will show that f (s) is an analytic continuation of f (x), x  r+, for s  s =

holomorphic in s then f (s, ) must be holomorphic in s for all   m, and both f
ds must be integrable over the set m. using (3.7) above we can write f (s) as

(3.11)

k(z) is holomorphic in s so f (s, ) is clearly holomorphic in s. the modied
bessel functions also satisfy that |k(z)| is bounded for |z|   for any   r+
and | arg z| <

from the form of f (s) in (3.11) it follows that f (s) has a limit value f (s)  d
for s  0 from s. from (3.10) it follows that d = cu v , and we dene f (0) = cu v . it
also follows from (3.11) that f (s) has a limit value for |s|   from s: f (s)  d
and (3.10) again sets d = cir.

where in both cases the contribution from the cut is rapidly decreasing in . note
that in these relations the integral is performed in the opposite scaling limit of the
quantity we calculate. we will here concentrate on (3.12) as perturbation theory can
be applied to f (s) when s  c0, we will call iir() = i().

we can choose coordinates in the coupling constant space so that the ultra-
violet xed point corresponds to g(s) = 0. in the ultra-violet limit where s  0 we
may describe f (s) by perturbation theory as g(s)  0. the nth order perturbative
approximation of f (s) is denoted by fn(s) and the corresponding integral by in().
in the limit of large  the contribution from the cut vanishes and we get

where the last equality follows setting s = s/ in (3.12) and then taking the limit

(3.15)

which is the perturbative estimate of cir we want to improve.

fn(s) is the ultra-violet perturbative approximation to f (s) and the integra-
tion range in i() is compact so lim0 in() = lim0 i() = cu v . in() therefore
provides a good approximation to i(), for small enough , since the power series ex-
pansion of i() is controlled by the small s expansion of f (s) for which perturbation
theory applies. this is illustrated in (4.30) below for the minimal models. for larger
values of  higher order terms in the expansion of in() become important and the
coecients of the expansion of in() and fn() part company. if cir < c
ir and if the
region where in() is a good approximation to i() is large enough, then in() will
have a minimum before approaching its limiting value of c
ir. since this minimum
occurs at the largest value of  for which in() is a reasonable approximation to i()
and the true value of cir is given by i(), it is this minimum of in() that we will
use to provide a better estimate of cir. the approximation then becomes

cir = in(m)

(3.16)

where m is the value where in() attains its minimum. below we consider the quan-
tity cexact = cu v  cir and denote the approximation to it capprox = cu v  in(m),
we call the perturbative value cpert = cu v  lim in() = cu v  c
ir. this ap-
proximation rests upon the assumption that the exact function is monotonically
decreasing from cu v to cir, or at least that its minimum value is close to cir. be-
low we will show that this is indeed the case for k = 4, at least to a very good
approximation.

3.3 exact bound on c

as discussed above can the exact value i() possibly be smaller than the asymptotic
value cir. we will denote by 
m the value where i() attains its minimum and
cest = cu v  i(
m), then cexact  cest measures the undershoot of the exact
function i() compared with its asymptotic value cir (see gure 3). from the spectral
representation of f (s) in (3.11) we can obtain a rigorous lower bound on this exact
undershoot. in [2] it was shown that the spectral density can be written as

c(2) = cir(2) + c(2),

we showed in (3.4) that r d2c(2) = cu v hence r d2c(2) = cexact. using this in

(3.11) we get

cest = cu v  i(

m) = cu v

and f (s) = f (s1/k) with k = 4. rescaling s allows us to move all  dependence into

m()). unitarity ensures that
c(2)  0 hence

m4, so that we can write (2,

(3.18)

the lower bound in the relative undershoot of i(
m) therefore equals min (). in
gure 2 we plot () for k = 4. with this value we get that min () = 0.0232
so the relative overshoot in cest compared with cexact is maximally 2.3%.
it
follows from (3.17) that the bound in (3.18) is only saturated for free theories (where
c(2)  (2  m2)) for general interacting theories will the relative overshoot be
smaller than | min ()|. we show in gure 3 the type of behaviour that we expect
and which is conrmed for the minimal models below.

the actual choice of k = 4 then is a compromise between maximising the range

of analyticity (small k) and minimising the undershoot in i(

m) (large k).

4. application to dierent 2d models

in this section we calculate the central charge for the free bosonic and fermionic the-
ory perturbed by a mass term. these theories are gaussian and we can calculate f (s)
exactly, the central charge can then be written as lim i() as the contribution
from the cut then vanishes. the infra-red limit of these theories is trivial (cir = 0)
as all the degrees of freedom are massive, and therefore decouple when approaching
the infra-red xed point where the scale goes to innity. the free theories are none
the less important to consider as we can here obtain the exact function i().

in 4.3 we consider the unitary minimal models perturbed by the relevant oper-
ator (1,3), this theory has a non-trivial infra-red xed point. we obtain the renor-
malisation group improved perturbative calculation of cir and compare with the
approximation (3.16).

12

4.1 the free boson

we take the action for the free bosonic theory in 2 dimensions with a mass m to be

s =z d2x (cid:18)1

2

(x)(x) +

1
2

m22(x)(cid:19) .

(4.1)

the perturbation away from the conformal eld theory is thus given by the purely
massive term 1
2m22. the theory is still a free theory o criticality and the correlator
ht t i can be calculated exactly in the whole scaling region from the ultra-violet to
the infra-red. with this normalisation the energy-momentum tensor becomes

t (z, z) = tzz(z, z) = 2 : (z, z)(z, z) :

(4.2)

with the correlator

ht (z, z)t (w, w)i = (2)2h: (z, z)(z, z) : : (w, w)(w, w) :i

= 2(2)2h(z, z)(w, w)i2,

(4.3)

as only the double contractions survive. using the form (3.6) of the free propagator
then (4.3) is 2(zzk0(m|z|))2 where we have set w = 0 using translation invariance.
we now use the identities k 
xk1(x),
k1(x) = k1(x) and (4.3) becomes

2 (kn1 + kn+1), k2(x) = k0(x) + 2

n =  1

ht (z, z)t (0, 0)i =

m2|z|2

8z4

hence f (s) with k = 4 becomes

1 (m|z|)+m2|z|2k 2

(cid:0)4k 2

0 (m|z|)+4m|z|k1(m|z|)k0(m|z|)(cid:1) ,

knowing f (s) exactly the central charges follow from (3.10) directly, but let us use
the relations (3.13), (3.12) in the limit of large  where the cut vanishes. for cu v we
substitute s = ms1/4,  = 
m4 in the contour c2. from (3.13) we then get that (for

for    only the contribution from the innitesimal semi-circle c survive and
here we can insert the asymptotic form for k1(z)  z1 and k0(z)   log z. in
this limit only the rst term with k 2
1 will contribute as is seen from the asymptotic
form. taking into account that we only integrate over half a circle we then get the
well known result cu v = 1, which is an exact result as the contribution from the cut
vanishes in this limit6. to calculate the infra-red central charge we use (3.14) hence
cir = lim iir() = lims f (s). from the asymptotic form of the modied
bessel functions kn(x)  ex, together with (4.1), it follows that cir = 0. figure 4a
shows the exact function iu v () computed by a numerical integration of (4.4) using
a nag fortran library integration routine. the gure shows how the contribution
from the cut vanishes in the limit of large . the exact infra-red function iir() is
plotted in gure 4b, it is important to note that the minimum value of iir() is very
small, namely 0.019.

6we could also directly have used the analogous of (3.14) namely lim iuv () = lims0 f (s)
which is again seen changing variable in (3.13) and taking the limit    in the integrand valid
for all rir < .

(4.5)

(4.6)

the same arguments as above yields cu v = 1
2, and the infra-red contribution cir =
lims f (s) = 0, again by using the asymptotic form of the bessel functions. again
we can obtain the exact functions i() by a numerical computation. we get the same
behaviour of iir() as in the bosonic case, but with the minimum value 0.0048, so
this exact function does again not dier much from the infra-red central charge at
its minimum value.

4.3 the unitary minimal models

the o critical quantum eld theory picks out a specic renormalisation group ow
from the ultra-violet to the infra-red conformal eld theory.
if the quantum eld
theory is in the neighbourhood of one of the renormalisation group xed points 
in coupling constant space (we may be choose the coordinates so  = 0 corresponds
to the ultra-violet cft) the action can be written as

s = scf t +

n

xi=1

iz d2x i(x).

(4.7)

here the i(x)s are scaling elds with scaling dimension i, the coupling constants
i then have mass dimension [i] = 2  i = yi. from (4.7) it follows that yi is
the renormalisation group eigenvalue of the scaling elds i. for renormalisable
quantum eld theories we need yi  0 and the scaling operators therefore have to be
relevant (y > 0) or marginal (y = 0). for relevant operators we will move away from
the xed point when the scale increases and scf t thus corresponds to an ultra-violet
critical point.

we consider quantum eld theories which have the unitary minimal models

m(m) as their scaling limits. the central charge for m(m) is given by

c(m) = 1 

6

m(m + 1)

, m = 3, 4, . . .

(4.8)

there are m(m  1)/2 primary elds

(p,q) = (mp,mq+1),

1  p  m  1, 1  q  m,

15

with the conformal dimensions

h(p,q) = h(p,q) =

((m + 1)p  mq)2  1

4m(m + 1)

,

(4.9)

so the primary elds are scalars (spin zero). it follows from (4.9) that 2(m  2) of
the primary elds satisfy  = 2h < 2 and are thus relevant operators 7. we will
consider the minimal models perturbed by the relevant operator (1,3) given by the
action

s = sm(m)  0z d2x (1,3)(x).

(4.10)

m+1 < 1, which exists in all m(m).

the reasons for choosing this operator are that:8
i) (1,3) is a relevant eld, h(1,3) = 1  2
ii) (m,n) form an algebra under the operator product expansion, from the fusion
rules of minimal models it follows that the set (1,n) constitutes a sub-algebra in
which only (1,1), (1,2) and (1,3) are relevant as seen from (4.9). (1,3) is normalised
so that the structure constant c(1,3)(1,3)(1,1) = 1 where i = (1,1) = (m1,m) is the
identity, and it has the self coupling c(1,3)(1,3)(1,3) = b(m). it does not couple to (1,2)
so it has no coupling to other relevant operators in the sub-algebra (1,n) [8, 9, 13].
this means that there is a renormalisation group ow connecting the ultra-violet and
infra-red xed points along the direction of (1,3) so it is consistent to include only
9, i.e. it is a geodesic renormalisation group trajectory [7].
the one relevant eld (1,3)
iii) (1,3) is the least relevant eld, and the perturbation in (4.10) becomes marginal
in the limit of m   as y = 4
m+1 so that y  0. in this limit the xed points are
arbitrarily close in coupling constant space, and perturbation theory is viable in the
whole region from the ultra-violet to the infra-red.

we want to calculate the dierence between the ultra-violet and the infra-red
central charge c = cu v  cir. it has been argued that the infra-red conformal eld
theory of (4.10) is given by the unitary minimal model m(m  1), as c in the
perturbative limit y  0 is given by c = 3
16y3 + o(y4) [8, 9], and from (4.8) we get
that

c(m)  c(m  1) =

12

m(m2  1)

=

3y3

2(2  y)(4  y)

=

3y3
16

+ o(y4).

(4.11)

7as the secondary elds will have a conformal dimension of at least h+1 there will be no relevant

secondary elds.

8the model (4.10) is integrable and was rst studied in [10]. the only other integrable pertur-
bations of the unitary minimal models are with (1,2) and (2,1). these three models corresponds
respectively to the korteweg-de vries, gibbon-samede-kotera and kupersmidth equations [11].

9this can be seen by writing the zamolodchikov metric in normal coordinates around the ultra-
violet xed point g = 0, gij = ij + o(g2), the beta-functions become in these coordinates i(g) =
jkgjgk + o(g3). if gi 6= 0 only for g(1,3) and c(1,3)(1,3)j = 0 for j 6= (1, 3) then

j (g(1,3)) = 0 for j 6= (1, 3) and there is no ow transverse to the (1,3) direction [3].

a general argument for all m has been given by a thermodynamic bethe ansatz
method in [14]10. we now describe how c is calculated using our approximation
method11, and we will compare this with the exact result cexact = c(m)  c(m  1).

the correlator hiji can be calculated in perturbative conformal eld theory using
the operator product expansion in the ultra-violet conformal eld theory. the bare

in the table the obtained values of the numerical integration denoted capprox are
listed together with the exact results cexact and the rg improved perturbative
values cpert. for m < 11 the perturbative result will break down as cpert becomes
negative and thereby violates unitarity. in [1] we used k = 2/y = (m + 1)/2, but
here we have chosen k = 4 as we then get a stricter bound on the exact function
as explained in section 3.3. the results for k = 2/y and k = 4 are similar for
all m calculated, except m = 11, 12 where they dier slightly. the improvement
of the approximation (3.16) over the rg improved perturbative result is seen to be
signicant. in gure 6 cexact capprox and cexact cpert are plotted (scaled with
m(m2  1) so that all the points can be distinguished) against m. the horizontal
axis is then the exact value. the gure shows that the approximation improves the
perturbative results with more than a factor two.

if we choose the maximum value k = 1 we get results which are almost identical
to the exact values, we denote these by capprox2, and plot in gure 7 cexact and

we do not have a strict bound on the exact function i() as for the case with k = 4
described in section 3.3. the exact function might still have a very small undershoot
if for example the smallest non zero mass of a one particle state is small compared
with 
m, i.e. cest  cexact. figure 7 shows the very good correspondence between
cexact and capprox2, this is remarkable because the approximation is based on only
a one loop calculation.

5. critical exponents for 4 in 3 dimensions

the other example we will consider is 4 theory in 3 dimensions with o(n) symme-

22

try14. we will study the ising (n = 1) case in detail here, but the method applies
for a general n. quantum eld theories have generic infra-red divergences in di-
mensions lower than 4, for 4 theory this can be seen by studying the 1pi 2 point
function [17]. a way of regulating these infra-red divergences is to either do an 
expansion in  = 4  d, or work with a massive theory. we will here do the lat-
ter, and work in d = 3 following [18]. we introduce the renormalised eld, mass
and coupling according to the conventions in [19] so the renormalised elds r are
given as:  = (z1)1/2r, 2 = z2(2)r and m, g denotes the renormalised mass and
coupling. the infra-red divergences are now removed and only show up in the bare
correlators as non analytic dependence in the bare coupling [18]. we will calculate
two of the infra-red critical exponents  and , all other exponents follow from scaling
relations15, e.g. fishers scaling relation  = (2  ).

the free 2 point correlator, or propagator, is given as

g0(p, m) =z ddx eipxh(x)(0)i =

1

p2 + m2 .

(5.1)

the mass is related to the critical temperature  as   m2, so that the free propa-
gator can be written as

g0(p, ) = h( p

 )

(5.2)

where h is regular at the origin and  = 1 and  = 1
2. this scaling behaviour
generalises to the interacting theory with critical exponents  and , hence from the
scaling relations all critical exponents can be obtained from the propagator. we will
now dene the function f (s) above for respectively  and , and show that they are
analytic in some sector with the correct scaling limits.

using that the massless theory for small momentum (infra-red region) is equiva-
lent to the large momentum region at g = gc [18] it follows from the callan-symanzik
equation for the renormalised propagator that in the limit of small momentum it
scales as g(p)  1

p2 , hence dening

f(p) = p

(5.3)

14this model is one of the most studied models in critical phenomena and it is important because
it shares its infra-red xed point with a number of physical models, such as: polymers (n = 0), the
ising model (n = 1), super-uid bose-liquid (n = 2) and the heisenberg ferromagnet (n = 3).

15the calculation of the critical exponents in 4 theory are among the most precise calculations
in quantum eld theory, and they have been calculated using both the  expansion, exact renormal-
isation group arguments, perturbative quantum eld theory, high temperature expansions, strong
coupling expansions and monte carlo simulations. these exponents describe the scaling behaviour
of the theory in the scaling region and are universal in the sense that they are only determined by
the infra-red xed point and are therefore identical for all quantum eld theories owing to this
point under the renormalisation group, irrespective of the underlying microscopic dynamics.

where the beta-function has been calculated up to 6-loops [21]. the perturbative
series for 4 theory was in [22] shown to be borel summable in the coupling of order
k = 1, so we set f (s) = f (s1). in [23] it was shown using the idea from [24] that

the coecients of the perturbative green functions f (g) = pn fngn for large n are

given as

fn = c(b)n(1 + bl + n)(1 + o(1/n))

(5.13)
where b, bl, c were calculated in [23, 25]. b = 0.14777422 and it follows that the con-
vergence radius of the borel transform of f (g) is given by bs = 1/b with a singularity
at 1/b. when bl > 0 we want to perform a borel-leroy transform of order k, which

replaces a formal series f =pn fnzn withpn(fn/(1 + bl + n/k)zn. instead of (2.9)

this function will then have the limits lim i() = fir and lim0 i() = fu v as

we introduce the scale parameter s via the exact running coupling g(s) (s  0
in the ultra-violet) then we know that f(g(s)) and f(g(s)) are asymptotic series
in g(s). we now approximate the exact running coupling g(s) with the solution to

(5.15)

with the boundary condition g
n(0) = 1, where n(g) is the perturbative  function
to the nth order. f(gn(s)), f(gn(s)) are then asymptotic series in s, which we will

write as fj(s) = pl(fj)lsl for j = , . the borel-leroy transform given by (5.14)

becomes

as we are only working with a truncated series we will set k = 1 (only innitesimally
dierent from k = 1 + ,   1), note we are summing up to n + 1 as the nth order
 function has n + 1 terms, and fj are known to the (n + 1)th order.

to nd the critical exponents ,  we will here do an analytical continuation
in the borel transform (which we do by a conformal mapping) followed by a pade
approximation. the details of this calculation are given in the appendix. we get the
following estimates17

and

 = 0.625  0.004

 = 0.0315  0.0020.

(5.17)

(5.18)

these numbers should be compared with  = 0.63040.0013 [20],  = 0.63000.0015
[26],  = 0.62900.0025 ( expansion [20]),  = 0.62890.0008 (monte carlo) and for
the other exponent  = 0.03550.0025 [20],  = 0.0320.003 [26],  = 0.03600.0050
( expansion [20]),  = 0.0374  0.0014 (monte carlo),  = 0.0347  0.001 (strong
coupling [27]), most of these numbers are taken from [20].

in the usual evaluation one determines the value of the critical coupling gc and
then evaluates the re-summed series at this point. the values then becomes very
dependent on the estimate of gc. one advantage of our method is that we do not have
to estimate gc, likewise we do not have to perform the laplace integral, but instead
the critical point is reached taking the limit in the borel transform. the disadvantage
of this method is that we do not have specic knowledge of the quantities rc, bl
governing the asymptotic behaviour for the transformed series in the scale parameter.
in the usual case of the perturbative expansion in the coupling these parameters are
obtained from estimates of the higher order behaviour of perturbation theory.

17the error in  is seen to be larger than the one in , in contrast to the errors form other methods.
the reason for this is that we have chosen a conservative estimate where we have averaged over the
results with to dierent -functions (using its alternating behaviour) as explained in the appendix.
the two -functions dier only in the 7th order term, and here the f term is about a factor 100
smaller than the f term resulting in less sensitivity to this averaging. the errors obtained could
be lowered e.g. using one of the techniques from [26] or as in [29] using the information about the
pole at rc to obtain an extra order in the pade table, but the aim here has not been to get a very
low error, but to apply the method described above to a well known example.

26

6. conclusion

we have described a general method of obtaining the infra-red limit of a physical
quantity as an integral in the ultra-violet region. this was done using the analytic
structure of green functions in a complex scale parameter and by moving all scale
dependence into the running coupling. the infra-red limit is then given as the limiting
value of the borel transform in the scale of the physical quantity. changing the way
in which the scale is introduced amounts to changing the order in the borel transform.
we have tested this on two examples where the infra-red limit is well known,
namely for the central charge of the perturbed unitary minimal models and the crit-
ical exponents of 4 theory in three dimensions. for the perturbed minimal models
we showed how an approximation method can be obtained for calculating the central
charge, and we get approximations close to the exact values already at one loop by
using the largest domain of analyticity implied by spectral decomposition. for the
4 theory our estimates of the critical exponents are within the errors of other, more
elaborate approximations.

a. pade approximation

the borel transform is analytic in a sector s() where   1 [16]. the series given
by (5.16) will have a pole at the negative real axis for some value  = rc (rc > 0)
determining its convergence radius. we will now analytically continue i() given by
(5.16) doing the conformal transformation (as in [17])

t =



rc + 

,  / (, rc],

 =

rct
1  t

,

(a.1)

so that i(t, bl) = i( rct
the series

1t, bl). if we write (5.16) as i() =pl ill then i(t) is given by

i(t) =

n+1

xl=1

il tl, il =

l

xm=1

imrm

m  1(cid:19).
c (cid:18) l  1

(a.2)

if all poles of i() lies in (, rc], as argued in [26, 17], then i(t) given by this series
is convergent for t  [0, 1). we want to evaluate this expression at the convergence
radius t = 1 (where i(t) is regular), to do this we will use pade approximants

27

[28, 29]. in pade approximation a function is approximated by a rational function,
called [l/m], with polynomials of degree l and m in the numerator and denominator
(and the constant in the denominator is 1). if the n rst terms of the function is
known then these coecients are matched with the coecients of the polynomials
where 0 < l + n  n. one then forms the pade table with entries [l/m]. the pade
approximation is based on the conjecture that there is a subsequence of diagonal pade
approximants [l/l] which converge uniformly to the function, and this conjecture
has shown to hold in practice. the diagonal pade approximants are conformally
invariant and are therefore independent of rc above. generally we should use pade
approximants close to the diagonal. note that according to the pade conjecture
one should still expect convergence of the pade approximants even if there are a
nite number of poles within |t| < 1, which is the case if not all poles of i() are in
(, rc].

we also have to determine the values of rc and bl. let us rst note that from
n(0) = 1 we have that gn(s) = s + o(s2) and in fj(s) =

the boundary condition g

pl(fj)lsl we thus have that (fj)l = ( fj)l +    where ( fj)l is the lth coecient of

g in fj(g), this means that the convergence radius of the transformed series cannot
be larger than the convergence radius of the series in the coupling g, i.e. 0 < rc 
bs = 1/b. also we would suspect that bl  b
l is the leroy parameter of the
series in g. if bl is chosen too large we will divide by more than the actual asymptotic
increase in (a.2) and the approximation value will be to small, if bl is chosen too
small we expect to get a poor convergence in the pade table. in the same way we
expect the approximate value to be too small if rc is chosen smaller than the actual
convergence radius because the values we are calculating are increasing from zero.
this is the behaviour we see in the tables and we estimate rc and bl to be respectively
the largest and smallest value so that there is convergence in the pade table.

l, where b

from the asymptotic form of the  function (5.13) it follows that it is alternating,
l=1 fl is to use
fl where fl = fl for l < n and fn = fn/2 [30]. we have also obtained
the approximation where the perturbative -function to the nth order (for n = 5 and
n = 6) is approximated in this way.

and an approximation to a truncated alternating asymptotic series pn
the series pn

l=1

using the criteria mentioned above, for the choice of rc, bl we get the following

pade table18

tabular error for the points chosen (which is here larger than the baker-hunter error
[32]), and rc = bs, bl = 2.4. using the  function with 1/2 times the last coecient
we get the pade table (we get the best convergence for the 5. order expression)

(a.4)

giving f,ir = 0.404  0.004, again with rc = bs and bl = 2.4. averaging over these
two we get for the critical exponent  = 0.626  0.003. at this value of bl and rc we
have the best convergence in the pade table, a more conservative estimate of f,ir
is obtained by varying rc and bs in a region around these values and then sample the
highest and lowest value for which there is some convergence in the pade table19.
this gives f,ir = 0.40  0.01 leading to

 = 0.625  0.004.

(a.5)

for the other exponent  we get approximately the same pade tables using either
the -function as given in (5.12) or with a half times the last term, the convergent
pade table becomes

and we obtain the critical exponent  = 0.0319  0.0010, where rc = bs and bl = 1.8.
again varying around these values gives the estimate

 = 0.0315  0.0020.

that the results evaluated using borel-leroy transforms were very stable under variation of bl and
