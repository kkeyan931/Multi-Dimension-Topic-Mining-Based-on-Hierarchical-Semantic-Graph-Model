1. introduction

it is a pleasure for me to contribute to yuri golfands memorial volume. i met yuri

several times during his occasional visits of lebedev institute in the 80s. two of our

discussions in 1985 i remember quite vividly.

golfand found appealing the interpretation of string theory as a theory of quantized

coordinates, viewing it as a generalization of some old ideas of noncommuting coordinates.

in what should be an early spring of 1985 he read our jetp letter [1] which was a brief

russian version of our approach with fradkin [2] to string theory eective action based

on representation of generating functional for string amplitudes as polyakov string path

integral with a covariant 2-d sigma model in the exponent. in [1] our approach was inter-

preted in a somewhat heuristic way: (i) the basic quantized pre-eld is a set of coordinates
xm of a d-dimensional space which may be taken as a string (or membrane) coordinates
depending on internal parameters i (world-volume coordinates); (ii) the classical space-
time coordinates are expectation or center-of-mass values of xm(); (iii) all space-time

elds are excitations of these quantized coordinates, appearing as generalized sources or

couplings in the path integral action, r d2p k1 xm1...knxmnbm1...mn(x()). golfand

asked me if superstring theory should then be interpreted as a theory of quantized super-

coordinates (x, ). i told him of a recent paper by green and schwarz [3] as the one that

should provide a basis for such a program. later in spring 1985 we generalized the sigma

model approach to green-schwarz superstring [4] using its light-cone gauge formulation

[5].

in summer of 1985 golfand approached me again after having seen the lebedev in-

stitute preprint version of our paper [6] on the derivation of the born-infeld action from

the open string theory. this was a simple application of the non-perturbative in number

of elds approach of [2], allowing one for the rst time to sum certain terms in the string
eective action to all orders in . yuri stressed the importance of the fact that the string
tension t = (2)1 is determining the critical value of the electric eld. he was also

excited about a possibility (noted in [6]) of a kind of bootstrap if such a non-linear action

following itself from string theory admits string-like solutions. in [6] we mentioned that
vortex solutions of similar born-infeld type actions (e.g. f 2) were discussed previously
in [7]. this idea has similarity to some recent developments: a simple plane wave type so-

lution of bi action (fa0 + fa1 = 0) may be re-interpreted (aa = t xa, fa1 = t ax1) as a

1

fundamental string ending on d-brane [8,9]  the dimensional reduction of bi action along
the 1-direction is simply the dbi action [10] describing d-brane collective coordinates.1

i recall that golfand was also asking me about supersymmetric extension of born-

infeld action. at that time i was not aware of an early work [12] on this subject, but later

in 1986 there appeared the paper [13] (inspired in part by the discovery of the relation
of the bosonic born-infeld action to string theory) where n = 1 supersymmetric version
of d = 4 bi action was presented in the explicit form. while the requirement of n = 1
d = 4 supersymmetry did not x uniquely the bosonic part of the nonlinear abelian vector

multiplet action [13] to be the standard p det(mn + t 1fmn), it is now clear that the
condition of n = 4, d = 4 (or n = 1, d = 10) supersymmetry should imply this.2

it seems, therefore, that a review of some aspects of the born-infeld action and its

supersymmetric extensions in the context of string theory is quite appropriate in this

volume.

2. born-infeld action from string theory

the born-infeld action was derived from string theory in [6] as eld strength derivative

independent part of the open string eective action by starting with an o-shell bosonic

open string path integral on the disc in an external (abelian) vector eld

z(a) =< tr p exp iz d xmam(x) > ,
2 nfnm + o(f ) ,
am(x0 + )  1

(2.1)

and using specic (-function) renormalization to get rid of a linear divergence. in ap-

pendix we repeat the original computation [6] of this partition function in the abelian

fmn = const background in a slightly generalized form: we shall assume that the bound-
ary part of the string action contains also the usual particle term m ( xm)2. here the

1 this is of course not surprising from more stringy perspective, as t -duality along 1-direction
should convert the wave momentum into the (wound) string charge. since this solution is essen-

tially a plane wave, it is also an exact solution of not only the bi action but also of the full open

string theory eective action [11].

2 in particular, the structure of f 4 [14,15] and, more non-trivially, f 6 [16] terms in the n = 1
supersymmetric deformation of the d = 10 super maxwell action was found to be exactly the

same as in the bi action.

2

constant m may be viewed as an o-shell condensate of a massive open string mode or

simply as a formal regularization parameter. the eective boundary action will then have
both a rst-derivative scale-invariant ( t ) and a second-derivative ( m ) parts and will
interpolate between the string-theory case t 6= 0, m = 0 discussed in [6] and the standard
particle case t = 0, m 6= 0 appearing in the schwinger computation of log det(d2(a)).
the resulting bosonic string partition function for a single magnetic eld component f will

be (superstring expression is similar, see appendix)

z 

(1 + t +if

m ) (1 + tif
m )
[(1 + t

m )]2

,

(2.2)

and thus will have the born-infeld p1 + (t 1f)2 and the schwinger

sions as its m = 0 and t = 0 limiting cases.

m 1f

sinh(m 1f) expres-

the f 2 + 2f 4 terms in bi action were found to be in precise agreement with the

ones derived directly from (super)string 4-point amplitude [17,18]. the reason why the

renormalized open string path integral on the disc in fmn = const background reproduced,
indeed, the correct eective action3 was explained in detail later [19,20]: the apparently

missing mobius group volume factor is only linearly divergent in the bosonic case (and is

nite in the superstring case) and thus is eectively taken care of by the renormalization.

the computation of the string partition function in a constant abelian background is

essentially an on-shell computation: fmn = const solves equations of motion for any
gauge-invariant action s(f ) depending only on the eld strength and its derivatives.4

furthermore, in the important paper [21] it was demonstrated that the leading-order

term in the expansion in f of the condition of conformal invariance of the open string

sigma model follows indeed from the bi action. in particular, fmn = const background

denes a conformal 2-d eld theory. the superstring generalization of this conformal invari-

ance argument implied [22] that the derivative-independent term in the open superstring

eective action should also be given by the same bi action. after some initial confusion in

3 it could seem that computing the partition function we were not dividing over mobius group

volume, compared to the standard on-shell generating functional for string s-matrix.

4 related point is that the bi action is unambiguous:

it is not changed by local eld re-

denitions of gauge potential since these lead to terms containing derivatives of fmn which, by

denition, are not included in the bi action. this is also related to the fact that the string

partition function in fmn = const background does not contain logarithmic divergences.

3

[17] (corrected in errata) this conclusion was reached [16] also in the original path integral

approach of [2].

born-infeld action is a unique example of the case when certain  string corrections
can be summed to all orders. though no similar action is known in the closed-string
context5 the expectation is that string tension denes a natural maximal scale for all eld

strengths, including curvature. the analogy with open string theory suggests that higher
order  terms in the eective action may eliminate (at least some) black hole singularities
[24]. while in the maxwell theory the eld of a point-like charge is singular at the origin

and its energy is innite, in the born-infeld theory the electric eld of a -function source

is regular at r = 0 (where it takes its maximal value) and its total energy is nite [25].
from the point of view of the distribution of the electric eld (e = 1
4 div e) the source

is no longer point-like but has an eective radius r0   (for example, in 4 dimensions
r2
0 = 2q). since both open and closed string theories are
er = frt =
eectively non-local with characteristic scale of , one may expect that schwarzschild
singularity is smeared in a similar way.

the remarkable second advent of d-branes [26] four years ago [27] brought the born-

infeld action again into the spot-light. in [10] the born-infeld action found a new interpre-

tation  as an action of d-branes in the static gauge. what was called dirac-born-infeld

action [10] was derived by applying the conformal invariance conditions approach of [21]
in the case of mixed (dirichlet and neumann) boundary conditions.6 the same action
can be also easily obtained [29] using the path integral approach as in [6].7 the path

integral approach makes t-duality covariance properties of the resulting d-brane actions

transparent, implying that all p < 9 brane actions can be obtained by direct dimensional

reduction from the d = 10 (p = 9 brane) born-infeld action. indeed, the dbi action is

5 apart from the suggestion in [23] (based on type i  heterotic string duality and conjecture
about special supersymmetry properties of the born-infeld action) that bi action may be summing
up f 2n+2 string n-loop corrections in the heterotic string theory.

6 some subtleties in the approach of [10] and attempts of generalization to the non-abelian

case were discussed in [28].

7 here the aim is to compute the string path integral on the disc in the presence of a d-brane.
this is the partition function of virtual open strings with mixed dirichlet-neumann boundary

conditions (i.e. with ends attached to a hyperplane) propagating in a condensate of massless
vector string modes. the collective coordinates x i and internal vector am degrees of freedom of
the d-brane are represented by the boundary background couplings as in [26,10].

4

not a new action, but is simply the reduction of the bi action. in particular, all solutions

of the dbi action can thus be obtained from the solutions of the higher-dimensional bi

action (see [9]).

thus the form of the d-brane action is determined by the abelian d = 10 open

string eective action [30,29] and is given by the born-infeld action for the d = 10 vector
potential8 a = (am, as = t xs) reduced down to p + 1 dimensions9

sp = tpz dp+1xq det( + t 1f )

= tpz dp+1xp det(mn + mx snx s + t 1fmn) .

(2.3)

this t-duality relation suggests that supersymmetrization of the dbi action (and its non-
abelian generalization) in at space10 should also be determined by that of the born-infeld
action.

originating from the bi action, the dbi action implies similar maximal eld strength

constraints on allowed physical congurations. in particular, the action for d0-brane is

simply that of a relativistic particle r dx0p1  (0x s)2, and the  maximal eld strength

constraint here is simply the standard relativistic constraint on particles velocity [30].

here it is interesting to recall that it was the analogy with the square root structure of the

relativistic particle action that was one of the original motivations of born in looking for

a non-linear electrodynamics action [25] which does not allow the electric eld of a point

charge to become innite.

3. some properties of bosonic d = 4 born-infeld action

the d = 4 born-infeld lagrangian

lbi = pdet4(mn + fmn)  1 ,

(3.1)

8 here we use the minkowski signature and the following notation: ,  = 0, 1, ..., 9; m, n =
0, 1, ..., p; s, r = p + 1, ..., 9, t 1 = 2, mncdmncd = 4!. the functions am and xs depend
only on xn = (x0, ..., xp).

9 in the low-energy or non-relativistic approximation, i.e. to the leading quadratic order in
fmn, this action is the same as the dimensional reduction of the d = 10 u (1) maxwell action for

am [31]. a simple determinant identity shows that this is true in general for the whole bi action.
10 this relation may no longer apply in the case of a non-trivial closed string background

without simple isometry properties.

5

where we set the fundamental (scale)2(=t 1 = 2 in the string theory context) equal
to 1, has several remarkable features, including electro-magnetic duality and causal prop-

agation (see, e.g., [32,33] and refs. there). since in four dimensions

det4(mn + fmn) = 1 + 1

2 fmnf mn  1

16 (fmnf mn)2 ,

f mn  1

2 mncdfcd ,

(3.2)

lbi interpolates between the maxwell lagrangian 1
derivative (topological density) i

4 fmnf mn for small f and the total
4 fmnf mn for large f . in euclidean signature one nds

[9]

lbi = q(1 + 1

4 fmnf mn)2 + 1

4 (fmn  f mn)2  1  1

4 fmnf mn ,

(3.3)

implying that the minimum of the euclidean action is attained at (abelian) self-dual elds

(for a discussion of related bps bounds for dbi actions see [34]). another useful repre-

sentation is

lbi = p(1 + i2)2 + 2i4  1 = i2 + i4[1 + o(f 2)] ,
4 (fmnf mn)2(cid:21) =  1

8(cid:20)fmnf nkfklf lm  1

i4   1

4 fmnf mn ,

i2  1
that lbi = i2 + i4 + o(f 6) is true in all dimensions, but it is only in d = 4 that all
higher order terms are proportional to i4. this fact is reected in the structure of the
supersymmetric generalization of the d = 4 bi action (see section 4.1).

8 (f (+))2(f ())2 .

(3.4)

the d = 4 born-infeld action is obviously symmetric under f  f  and is also
covariant under the electric-magnetic (or vector  vector) duality, as can be concluded
from the structure of the equations of motion [32] (see also [35,36]) or demonstrated directly

at the level of the action by following the standard steps of introducing the lagrange

multiplier for the f = da constraint and solving for f in the classical approximation [29].

in four dimensions it is possible to write down the bi action in the form quadratic

in fmn by introducing two complex auxiliary scalar elds [37]. first, we replace lbi
(changing its overall sign as appropriate for the minkowski signature) by

p det(mn + fmn)   1

2 v det(mn + fmn) + 1

2 v 1 ,

use (3.2) and introduce the second auxiliary eld u to split the quartic (f f )2 term .
finally, we can eliminate the term with v 1 by introducing a complex auxiliary scalar
a = a1 + ia2, a = a1  ia2, and writing the lagrangian as [37]

l4 =  1

2 v (a + a + aa  1

2 fmnf mn) + 1

2 fmnf mn]  1

2 (a + a) ,

(3.5)

2 u [i(a  a) + 1

or as

l4 = im(cid:18)(cid:20)a + 1

4 (fmnf mn + ifmnf mn)(cid:21) + ia (cid:19) ,

2 aa  1
 = 1 + i2  u + iv .

(3.6)

the constraint implied by  is solved by a = a(f ) with im a(f ) = 1
part

4 f mnf mn and the real

re a(f ) = q1 + 1

2 f 2  1

16 (f f )2  1 ,

(3.7)

which (up to sign) is the bi lagrangian itself. this gives a natural explanation for the

square root structure of the born-infeld action. one can thus view the d = 4 bi action

as resulting from a peculiar theory for two complex non-propagating scalars (, a) coupled

non-minimally to a vector. shifting  by i the lagrangian (3.6) can be put into the form

that does not contain terms linear in the elds

l4 =  1

4 fmnf mn + 1

2 aa  im(cid:18)(cid:2)a + 1

2 aa  1

4 (fmnf mn + ifmnf mn)(cid:3)(cid:19) .

(3.8)

since in this form the bi action is quadratic in the vector eld, it is very simple to demon-

strate its covariance under the vector-vector duality. adding the lagrange multiplier term
f abfab, where fab is the strength of the dual vector eld, and integrating out fab we
1
2
nd that the dual action has the same form as (3.6) with 11

fab  fab ,

  1 ,

a  ia .

(3.9)

like the maxwell action, the action (3.6) is not invariant under this duality. there exists,

however, an equivalent action containing one extra vector eld variable which is manifestly

duality-symmetric [37]. duality-symmetric actions was explained

the bi lagrangian in the form (3.6),(3.8) may be viewed as a special case of the

following lagrangian for a vector coupled non-minimally to a set of massive scalars

l =  1

(3.10)
in the limit when masses of scalars are much larger than their gradients so that the (an)2
terms may be ignored, (3.10) reduces to (3.8) with the scalars n being linear combinations
of 1, 2, a1, a2 in (3.8). this action may be viewed as a truncation of the cubic open string

eld theory action which reproduces the bi action as an eective action upon integrating

out at the string tree level all massive string modes (represented here by n) [6,38]. the
kinetic terms (an)2 may be dropped since they lead to derivative-dependent o(f )
terms which, by denition, are not included in the leading part of the low-energy eective

action. note that to represent higher dimensional born-infeld action in a cubic form similar
to (3.10) one would need to introduce auxiliary tensor elds to split the higher-order f n
invariants in det(mn + fmn).

4. supersymmetric born-infeld actions with manifest d = 4 supersymmetry

below we shall review what is known about generalizations of born-infeld action with

manifest d = 4 supersymmetry.

there exists a remarkable connection between (i) partial supersymmetry breaking,

(ii) nonlinear realizations of extended supersymmetry, (iii) bps solitons, and (iv) nonlinear
born-infeld type actions (see, e.g., [39,40,41,37] and refs. there). extended n > 1 super-
symmetry can be partially broken either by a non-translationally invariant background

(soliton) in a second-derivative higher-dimensional theory or by a translationally invariant

vacuum in a nonrenormalizable theory in four dimensions containing non-minimal inter-

actions [42].

the interpretation (and derivation) of n = 1 supersymmetric bi action [12,13] as
the action for a goldstone multiplet associated with partial breaking of n = 2 to n = 1
supersymmetry was suggested in [41]. as was demonstrated in [37], the connection between

partial breaking of supersymmetry and nonlinear actions is not accidental and has to do

with constraints that lead directly to nonlinear actions of born-infeld type. spontaneously

broken symmetries give nonlinear realizations of the broken symmetry group. a standard

way to nd such realizations is to begin with a linear representation and impose a nonlinear

constraint. the constrained supereld approach [43,37] appears to be a universal and

transparent way of deriving and dealing with these actions.

in a similar way, a massless n = 2 vector multiplet may be also considered as a
goldstone multiplet associated with partial spontaneous breaking of n = 4 supersymmetry
to n = 2 [44]. the n = 2 analog of the n = 1 supersymmetric born-infeld action was
suggested in [45]. though this was not proved to all orders, it is likely that the bosonic part

of this action is related (after a eld redenition eliminating higher derivative scalar terms)

to the dbi action for a 3-brane moving in 6 dimensional space-time (with two scalars of
the n = 2 vector multiplet playing the role of the transverse collective coordinates).

8

the n = 4 supersymmetric extension of the born-infeld action (written, e.g., in terms
of n = 1 or n = 2 superelds) is not known at present and it appears to be non-trivial
to construct it (cf. [37]). below we shall describe what can be learned about the structure
of the f 4 term in such n = 4 action using the knowledge of the n = 1 and n = 2 born-
infeld actions and assuming the expected global su (3) symmetry of the n = 4 action
written in terms of n = 1 superelds [46].

4.1. n = 1 supersymmetric action

the n = 1 supersymmetric bi action can be written in the following way [13]12

s = 1

2 z d4x(z d2 w w + h.c.) +z d4xz d2d2  b(k, k)w w w  w  ,

(4.1)

where

b 

1

1  1

2 (k + k) +q1  (k + k) + 1

= 1

2 + 1

4 (k + k) + ... ,

k  d2(w w) ,

4 (k  k)2
k  d2( w  w ) .

(4.2)

(4.3)

the action depends in general on dimensional scale parameter which is set to 1 as in (3.1).

since

(d2w 2), =0 =  1

4 f mnfmn 

i
4

f mnf mn  i

2 mm + 1

2 d2

the bosonic part of the action depends on the square of the auxiliary eld d so that d = 0

is always a solution.

to get insight into the structure of (4.1) and to exhibit its invariance under the second

(spontaneously broken, i.e. non-linearly realized) supersymmetry [41] it is useful to rederive
this non-linear action using constrained n = 2 supereld approach [37]. we start with
n = 2 vector multiplet described by constrained chiral eld strength w(x, 1, 2) that
abw = caccbd d2cd w (a, b = 1, 2). dening d  d1, q 
obeys the bianchi identity d2
d2 this becomes d2w = q2 w, dqw =  d q w. we break n = 2 supersymmetry to
n = 1 by assuming that w has a lorentz-invariant condensate hwi (we set the scale of
the supersymmetry breaking to 1):

w  hwi + w ,

hwi = 2
2 ,

hq2wi = 1 ,

dhwi = 0 .

(4.4)

12 we follow the same conventions as in [37], in particular, d2 = 1

2 dd.

9

we reduce the eld content to a single n = 1 supereld by imposing13

w 2 = 0 .

then the above constraints imply

q2w = d2 w  1 ,

0 = 1

2 q2w 2 = w( d2 w  1) + 1

2 qwqw .

(4.5)

(4.6)

projecting to n = 1 superspace by setting 2 = 0 and dening the n = 1 superelds

  w|2=0 ,

w  qw|2=0 ,

(4.7)

we nd that the constraint for the chiral superpartner of the vector multiplet in the n = 1
superspace description of the n = 2 vector multiplet is
2 w w ,

 =  d2  + 1

(4.8)

which coincides with the constraint in [41].

because of the constraints (4.4),(4.5),(4.8), there are many equivalent n = 2 forms
that all give the same n = 1 action [37]. one example is a class of actions proportional to
the n = 2 fayet-iliopoulos term: r d21d22 f (w) = f(0)r d21. another action that
leads to the same constraints and the nal n = 1 born-infeld action is the standard free
n = 2 vector action, i.e. the action for the n = 1 vector (v ) and chiral () superelds,
plus a term with a chiral n = 1 supereld lagrange multiplier  imposing the constraint
(4.8)

s = z d4x(cid:18)z d2(cid:20)( 1
shifting    + i, we get

2 w w +  d2 ) + i( 1

2 w w +  d2   )(cid:21) + h.c.(cid:19) .

s = z d4x(cid:20)z d2(cid:18)i(cid:2) 1

2 w w +  d2   (cid:3) +  (cid:19) + h.c.(cid:21) .

the resulting action is thus simply

s = z d4x(cid:20)z d2 (w, w ) + h.c.(cid:21) ,

(4.9)

(4.10)

(4.11)

13 this removes independent chiral supereld part of the n = 2 multiplet. it would be inter-
esting to generalize the discussion to the case when the chiral supereld is rst kept independent

and then integrated out.

10

where  is the solution of the constraint (4.8). since the explicit solution of (4.8) is [41]

(w, w ) = 1

2 w w + 1

2

d2(cid:20)b(k, k)w w w  w (cid:21) ,

(4.12)

where b was dened in (4.2), the action (4.11) is nothing but the n = 1 supersymmetric
born-infeld action (4.1).

one concludes [41,37] that the requirement of partially broken n = 2 supersymmetry
uniquely xes the action for the n = 1 vector multiplet to be the supersymmetric born-
infeld action. as explained in [37], the n = 1 supersymmetric born-infeld action also
emerges as an eective action from the n = 2  n = 1 supersymmetry breaking model
of [42] when one decouples (integrates out) the massive chiral multiplet.

the bonus of the above derivation is that it reveals the hidden non-linearly realized
supersymmetry of the born-infeld action (4.11)  the broken half of the original n = 2
symmetry [41]. the second (n = 2) supersymmetry transformation law follows from the
above constraints and denitions of the n = 1 supereld components,
2  (q +   q )w|2=0 = w ,
2w = ( d2   1)  i   . (4.13)
note that this transformation is non-linear since  (4.12) contains terms of all orders in
w (and thus also in the fundamental scale parameter or in 2).

the bosonic part of the supersymmetric action (4.10) is exactly the bi action repre-

sented in the form (3.6) with the two auxiliary complex scalar elds elds a and  being

the corresponding scalar components of the chiral superelds  and  in (4.10). as in the

bosonic case (3.6), the lagrange multiplier representation (4.10) of the action also simpli-
es [37] the proof [41] of the duality covariance of the n = 1 supersymmetric born-infeld
action (4.11),(4.12).

let us make a brief comment about the quantum properties of the born-infeld actions.

viewing bi action as a leading term in the low-energy eective action of string theory, it
does not make much sense to quantize it directly,14 unless one is systematically keeping
all momenta small compared to the cuto 1 as in other eective eld theories (see,

14 ignoring derivative corrections, born-infeld action represents a sum of string tree diagrams
with massive modes on internal lines and massless vectors on external lines. quantum loop

corrections to born-infeld action thus represent only a subclass of all string loop diagrams where,

e.g., loops of massive modes are not included. it is only the sum of all string diagrams at a given

loop order that is expected to be uv nite.

11

e.g., [47]). still, formally, one may try to view the bi action as dening a fundamental

theory and compute the corresponding quantum corrections using, e.g., background eld

method. it is easy to see that logarithmically divergent corrections to the abelian bosonic

bi action will involve derivatives of the eld strength, i.e. the original bi action is not
renormalizable. the same is true in the n = 1 supersymmetric case: as follows from
(4.1), all terms additional to the maxwell w 2 term in the n = 1 bi lagrangian are no
longer f-terms, but d-terms, and thus may be deformed by quantum corrections.15 this

was indeed conrmed by explicit computations in [48,49] which demonstrated that the
leading 1-loop logarithmically divergent correction to the (n  2) supersymmetric born-
infeld action has the 4f 4 form. it is not completely surprising that the same 4-derivative
term (whose n = 1 structure  r d4mw mwn w n w  [49] is determined by the

supersymmetry) appears as the leading derivative correction to the born-infeld term in

the tree-level open superstring eective action [20] (see section 7).

4.2. n = 2 supersymmetric action

the n = 2 extension of the born-infeld action suggested in [45] is similar in structure

to the n = 1 one (4.1):

s = 1

2 z d4xz d4 w 2 + 1

4 z d4d4  b(k, k)w 2 w 2 ,

(4.14)

where

b =

(4.15)

(4.16)

the lagrangian here h = w 2 + ... (cf. (4.11)) satises the n = 2 generalization of the
n = 1 non-linear constraint (4.8),

h = 1

4 h d4h + w 2 ,

h 2 = 0 .

(4.17)

15 note, however, that there should be no nite quantum renormalization of the coecient in
front of the n = 1 bi action (4.1) as part of the full quantum eective action: assuming that
the second spontaneously broken supersymmetry survives at the quantum level, it should again

relate the coecient of the d-term in (4.1) to that of the f-term and thus should rule out its

nite renormalization. this should be related to expected non-renormalization of the bps 3-brane

tension.

12

the analogy with the n = 2  n = 1 supersymmetry breaking case discussed above
suggests a relation to the n = 4  n = 2 supersymmetry breaking [44] and thus the
interpretation of (4.14) as the unique action for the n = 2 vector multiplet as a goldstone
multiplet associated with the partial breaking of n = 4 supersymmetry. in this case (4.14)
should have hidden invariance under two extra spontaneously broken and non-linearly

realized supersymmetries which should unambiguously determine the form of the action

via the non-linear constraint (4.17).

this action contains terms without derivatives and with higher derivatives of the com-

plex scalar eld. at rst sight, this seems to contradict its possible interpretation as a dbi

action (the nambu-type actions for the transverse collective coordinates should contain

scalars only through their rst derivatives as required by the translational invariance).

tions (cf.

however, it is likely that the higher-derivative terms can be eliminated by eld redeni-
[45,50,37]). these, however, will make n = 2 supersymmetry of the resulting
action non-manifest. this clash between the requirement of dependence on rst derivatives

of scalars and manifest extended supersymmetry is likely to be the general property of the
n  2 supersymmetric born-infeld actions.

to demonstrate that such unwelcome terms can indeed be redened away let us con-

sider the rst subleading four-eld term in the action (4.14) and show that the second-

derivative scalar terms there are indeed proportional to the leading-order equation of mo-
tion 2 (i.e. vanish on shell) and thus can be eliminated by a eld redenition. the
n = 2 chiral supereld w satises the constraints d iw = 0, d4w = 2 w, implying
the following expansion in terms of n = 1 superelds:
2 w(y, ) + 

2 2 d2 (y, )

w = (y, ) + 2

the leading correction term in (4.14) is

i4 = z d4 i4 ,

i4 = z d42 w 2 w 2 ,

(4.20)

where i4 can be expressed in terms of n = 1 elds as follows

i4 = w w w  w  + i( m  m )w m

 

w

2 (  mm + m m )  2 mm  .

(4.21)

the cross-term can be written also as w  w d d  . related expressions for the n = 2
invariant w 2 w 2 in terms of n = 1 superelds appeared in [50,45].
if one is allowed
to integrate by parts (which is possible in the action under the integral over x-space)
and omit terms proportional to equations of motion (which can be redened away by a
transformation preserving n = 1 supersymmetry as in [50]) then the 4 terms in (4.21)
reduce to just one term only, since

m(2)m( 2) + 1

4 (2 2) = 2m( )m( )

(2 2) .

(4.22)

integrating over  one nds that the component form of the 4 terms in (4.21) agrees with
the 4-derivative term ()2( )2 in the non-linear action for a chiral multiplet in [51,37].16
to all orders the scalar part of the n = 2 action is expected to coincide (after eld

redenitions) with

l = pdet(mn + mx 1nx 1 + mx 2nx 2)

which can be written in the form (  x 1 + ix 2) [37]

(4.23)

this is the bosonic part of the action of the non-linear chiral multiplet [37,52,53] (dual to
a tensor multiplet action [52,37,53]) with n = 1 supereld lagrangian

(4.24)

the lagrangian (4.24) has manifest translational symmetry and thus denes the action
representing the 3-brane in 6 dimensions of ref.
[40]. it is natural to expect that there
exists an exact n = 1 supereld redenition that puts the -dependent part of the n = 2
bi action (4.14) into the form (4.24).

4.3. four-derivative terms in the n = 4 supersymmetric born-infeld action

it would be interesting for several reasons (e.g., in connection with quantum properties

of d3-branes and their comparison with supergravity) to nd a manifestly supersymmetric
formulation of n = 4 born-infeld action generalizing n = 4 maxwell theory. related (by
a eld redenition) component action with 4 linearly realized and 4 nonlinearly realized

global d = 4 supersymmetries can be found by xing static gauge and  symmetry gauge

in the d3-brane action with global d = 10 supersymmetry constructed in [54,55,56] (see
section 5). however, the form of the n = 4 supersymmetric action with manifest unde-
formed linear d = 4 supersymmetry, e.g., written in terms of unconstrained n = 1, d = 4
superelds  one real vector with eld strength w and 3 chiral scalar a (a = 1, 2, 3),
is not known. for 2, 3 set equal to zero the action should reduce to the n = 1 form
of the n = 2 action (4.14). after a eld redenition eliminating higher derivative scalar
terms the bosonic part of the action should become the 10  4 dimensional reduction of
the d = 10 born-infeld action, i.e. the dbi action of a d3-brane moving in 10 dimensions,

s = z d4xp det(mn + mx snx s + fmn) ,

s = 1, ..., 6 ,

(4.25)

or, equivalently, squaring the matrix which appears under the determinant,

s = z d4x(cid:20)  det(mn + 2tmn + tmrtnr + fmrfnr + 2tr(mfn)r)(cid:21)1/4

,

(4.26)

where tmn  mx snx s.

the 6 real coordinates x s should be related to the 3 complex scalar components of

a by

a = x a + ix a+3 ,

mx snx s = (man) a .

(4.27)

the bosonic lagrangian in (4.25),(4.26) has the following expansion in powers of derivatives

the knowledge of the bosonic action (4.29), the 4-derivative term in the n = 2 action
(4.21) and the condition of su (3) symmetry in the chiral supereld sector allows one to
deduce the analog of the term (4.21) in the n = 1 supereld form of the n = 4 born-infeld
action [46]. this gives the n = 4 generalization of the i4  f 4 invariant in the born-infeld
action (3.4) and its n = 1 (w 2 w 2) (4.1) and n = 2 (4.21) counterparts.

modulo the terms with 2 the only possible su (3) invariant generalizations of the

three 4 terms in (4.21) are

p1 = 1

2 ( a bmamb + abm am b) ,

p2 = b bmam a ,

p3 = b amam b ,

p1 = p2  p3 + 1

4 mm(a ab b)

(4.30)

(4.31)

using (4.19) and dropping the terms with 2 which can be eliminated by a eld rede-
nition in the total action containing 2 + 4 terms, as well as total derivative terms, we
nd that the scalar eld parts of these invariants are

z d4 p1 = 2mambn an b ,

(4.32)

z d4 p2 = mam bnbn a  mam anbn b  mambn an b ,
z d4 p3 = mam anbn b  mambn an b  mam bnbn a .

to determine the relevant linear combination of p1, p2, p3 that generalizes the 4 terms in
(4.21) we shall use the comparison of the scalar eld terms with the corresponding (x)4
structures in the bi action (4.29) (which can be also obtained by dimensional reduction
from the f 4 terms in the d = 10 born-infeld action). we nd that the right combination
is p1 + p2  3p3, i.e. the su (3) invariant generalization of (4.21) to the case of several
chiral superelds is

i4 = w w w  w  + i( ama  am a)w m

 

w 

2 ( a bmamb + abm am b) + b bmam a 3 abmam b . (4.33)
+ 1
ignoring 2 terms, the 4 terms in (4.33) can be rewritten simply as 4p3 +
4 (a ab b), or as

1

2m(a b)(b a)  3

4 (a ab b) ,

(4.34)

where the total derivative term may be dropped in the action. this simple su (3) invariant
expression is the generalization of the n = 2 expression (4.22).

the n = 4 analog of the f 4 term in the born-infeld action may be written also in
terms of n = 2 superelds using projective superspace approach [57,58], or as an integral
of the 4-th power of the analytic on-shell n = 4 supereld of [59].

5. supersymmetric born-infeld actions with deformed supersymmetry from

d-brane actions

component d3-brane actions with d = 10 space-time supersymmetry and local

reparametrization invariance and world-volume -symmetry were constructed in [54,55,56]

(in at and generic curved backgrounds).

the n = 1, d = 10 supersymmetric born-infeld action was obtained in [55] by xing
the static gauge and a  symmetry gauge in the d9-brane in at type iib background.

before gauge xing the action depends on two d = 10 majorana-weyl spinors 1, 2 and
is invariant under two global d = 10 supersymmetries. after  symmetry gauge xing

by setting 2 = 0 the action depends on the vector a and the remaining majorana-weyl
spinor 1  ,17

s10 = z d10xq det( + f  2   +   ) .

(5.1)

here m are the d = 10 dirac matrices. this action is invariant under the two original
supersymmetries supplemented by the  symmetry transformation to maintain the gauge.

one of the resulting symmetries (corresponding to the spontaneously broken half of the
n = 2, d = 10 supersymmetry) is realized non-linearly. under the other (unbroken
combination of the two original symmetries)  has a homogeneous transformation law.

similar action for the d3-brane is obtained by reduction to 4 dimensions [55] (cf. (4.25))

s4 = z d4xp det(mn + mx snx s + fmn + mn) ,
mn  2 (m + smx s)n + sm sn .

(5.2)

the unbroken supersymmetry of (5.1) or (5.2) has complicated form with terms of all
orders in f or in the fundamental scale parameter (the inverse string tension factor 2
suppressed in (5.1)). it may be thought of as an -deformation of the linear supersym-
metry transformations of the n = 1, d = 10 maxwell multiplet. this is opposite [55] to
what was the case in the n = 1, d = 4 supereld action discussed in section 4.1 where
the unbroken supersymmetry was undeformed and was simply the original maxwell super-

symmetry while the broken supersymmetry was non-linear (cf. (4.13) [41]) and contained
terms of all orders in f or in . the two formulations are presumably related by a eld
redenition.

17 the form of the action in a dierent -symmetry gauge  killing gauge  was given in [48].

17

the leading terms in the expansion of (5.1) (or its dimensional reduction (5.2)) should
be related by a eld redenition in the fermionic sector to the known f 2 + 2f 4 defor-
mation of the n = 1, d = 10 maxwell action [14,15]. the latter can be derived by a
supersymmetric completion of the bosonic gauge theory term f 4  1
4 (f 2)2 starting with
the standard the n = 1, d = 10 sym supersymmetry transformation laws and deforming
the latter by 2 corrections. alternative route is directly deducing the 4-fermion terms
from the open superstring amplitude (the structure of the corresponding invariant is dic-

tated by the standard massless mode superstring 4-point kinematic factor [60]). in terms
of the d = 10 gauge eld strength f and d = 10 majorana-weyl spinor  one nds
(up to a eld redenition) the following supersymmetric completion of the f 2 + f 4 terms
(2 = 1) [15]18

 (cid:21) .

(5.3)

comparing the action (5.2) to the actions with manifest linear n > 1 supersymmetry
discussed in sections 4.2, 4.3 we see that while (5.2) depends only on the rst derivatives of

the scalars, the manifestly supersymmetric actions like (4.14),(4.21),(4.33) involve zero and

second derivatives of the scalars before one makes eld redenitions. such eld redenitions

should be (at least partially) responsible for a non-linear modication of the supersymmetry

transformation laws of the resulting translationally invariant actions like (5.2).

let us briey mention that one can also obtain a similar action for a d3-brane moving
in curved ads5  s5 vacuum background of type iib theory [61].19 the bosonic part of
this action or the action for a d3-brane moving near the core of another d3-brane has the

form

s = z d4x |x|4(cid:20)q det(mn + q|x|4mx snx s + q1/2|x|2fmn)  1(cid:21) + scs(x) ,

(5.4)

18 the corresponding non-abelian expression [14] is found by taking the elds to be u (n )

matrices and adding symmetrized trace.

19 the space-time supersymmetric and -symmetric d3-brane action was constructed in terms
of the invariant cartan one-forms dened on the coset superspace su (2, 2|4)/[so(4, 1)  so(5)].
the method used is conceptually very close to the one used in [55] to nd the action of a d3-brane

propagating in at space as a d = 4 born-infeld plus wess-zumino -type model on the at coset

superspace (d = 10 super poincare group)/(d = 10 lorentz group).

where q = 4n gs2,
x s/|x|. the supersymmetric extension of this action generalizes (5.2). this action should
coincide with the leading ir, large n , part of the quantum n = 4 su (n ) sym eective
action obtained by keeping the u (1) n = 4 vector multiplet as an external background and
integrating out massive sym elds [62,63,64,65].20 one simple test of this conjecture is
the following: since the quantum n = 4 sym theory is conformally invariant, the resulting
action should also have (spontaneously broken by scalar eld background and thus non-
linearly realized) conformal symmetry. the non-linear conformal invariance of the bosonic
part of the static-gauge d3-brane action in ads5 background was indeed demonstrated
in [64,66].21 the validity of this quantum sym  bi conjecture suggested by the
supergravity  sym correspondence should rely on the the existence of many new non-
renormalization theorems.

like the at-space action of [54,55], the action in [15] is invariant under the 32 global
supersymmetries of the ads5  s5 vacuum and -invariant. its conformal invariance is a
consequence of the so(4, 2)  so(6) isometry of the ads5  s5 metric and is manifest
(linearly realized) before the static gauge xing. it is only after choosing the standard
poincare coordinates and xing the static gauge and appropriate -symmetry gauge it
will have a sym eective action interpretation (details of this procedure remain to be
understood). like the at space action (5.2), it will then have 16 linear and 16 non-linear
(conformal) supersymmetries, i.e. only the iso(3, 1)  so(5) and 16 supersymmetries
of the original symmetry will remain manifest, but the superconformal symmetry will be
realized non-linearly. while for both d3-brane actions  in at space and in ads5 
s5 space  their gauge-xed forms have only 16 linearly realized supersymmetries, the
interpretation of the remaining 16 supersymmetries as conformal ones is possible only
in the ads5  s5 case.22 the dierence between the two actions is related to the fact
that while the at space action (5.2) has explicit scale (), the role of such scale in
the ads5  s5 action is played by the modulus of the scalar eld.23 as in the at case,
the resulting action should be invariant under complicated (x-deformed) supersymmetry
transformations. examples of similar actions in lower dimensions were constructed in [67].

20 scs which is so(6) invariant (does not depend on |x|) should have purely 1-loop origin.
21 as conjectured in [64] (and demonstrated for the particular case when only the modulus of
xs is non-constant), this non-linear symmetry may be xing the structure of the action (5.4)
uniquely.

22 this interpretation seems to depend on a proper choice the -symmetry gauge which should

be dierent, e.g., from the 2 = 0 choice in [55].
23 in contrast to the ads5  s5 one, the at-space born-infeld -type d3-brane action is not, of
course, related to quantum sym theory; instead, the higher-order terms in it are interpreted as
tree-level string-theory  corrections.

19

6. non-abelian generalization of born-infeld action

the abelian born-infeld action represents the derivative-independent part of the open

string tree level eective action.

in contrast, the part of the string eective action for

the non-abelian vector eld which depends on the eld strength but not on its covariant

derivatives is not dened unambiguously since [dm, dn]fkl = [fmn, fkl]. one natural

denition of the non-abelian born-infeld (nbi) action suggested in [68] which will be

described below is based on replacing fmn in the bi action by a non-abelain eld strength
and adding the symmetrized trace in front of the det action.

6.1. string theory considerations

this denition can be motivated from string theory as follows [68].24 one starts with

the path integral representation for the generating functional for the vector scattering
amplitudes on the disc25

z(a) =< tr p exp iz d [ xmam(x)  1
= z ddx0 < tr p exp iz d [ mam(x0 + )  1

2 mnfmn(x)] >

(6.1)

2 mnfmn(x0 + )] > ,

where the trace is in the fundamental representation of the chan-paton group, x = x0 +
(), 0 <   2 and the averaging is done with the free string propagator restricted
to the boundary of the disc, i.e. with the action r (g1 + k1) (12  1  2,
  +0)

g(1, 2) =

1




xn=1

en

n

cos n12 ,

k(1, 2) =

1




xr=1/2

er sin r12 .

(6.2)

using the radial gauge mam(x0 + ) = 0, am(x0) = 0 (see, e.g., [71]) one nds the
following expansion in terms of symmetrized products of covariant derivatives of f at x0,

z d mam(x0 +) = z d m(cid:2) 1

2 nfnm + 1

3 nldlfnm + 1

8 nlsd(sdl)fnm +...(cid:3) . (6.3)

24 a somewhat dierent proposal was made in [69].
25 here p stands for the standard path ordering. as explained in [70,20], the [am, an] term in
fmn appears from the contact terms in the supersymmetric theta-functions in the denition of

the supersymmetric path ordering.

20

then

z(a) = z ddx0(cid:2)l(f ) + o(d(k...dl)f )(cid:3) ,

l(f ) =< tr p exp(cid:2) 1

2 ifnmz d ( mn + mn)(cid:3) > .

(6.4)

(6.5)

dropping all symmetrized covariant derivatives leaves us with l(f ). the path integral
in (6.5) is eectively non-gaussian because of the path ordering of the fnm(x0)( mn)()
factors which is non-trivial if the matrices fmn do not commute. if we further dene the
nbi lagrangian as part of l(f ) which does not contain commutators of f s, or, more
precisely, which is completely symmetric in all factors of f in each monomial tr(f...f ),

we can then replace the trace in (6.5) by symmetrized trace, i.e. treat fmn matrices as if
they are commuting and thus drop the path ordering symbol. the resulting path integral

is then computable exactly as in the abelian case [19]

(6.6)

(6.8)

this nbi action represents in a sense a minimal non-abelian extension of the abelian

born-infeld action which is consistent with the basic requirement of tree-level string the-

ory  overall single trace of products of eld strengths as matrices in the fundamental
representation. remarkably, it reproduces exactly the f 2 + 2f 4 terms in the full non-
abelian open superstring eective action26

tr-form in [17].

21

 1

4 fmnfmnfrlfrl  1

8 fmnfrlfmnfrl(cid:1) + o(4)(cid:3) .

it should be stressed that these f 4 terms represent the full o(2) term in the superstring
eective action, i.e. all other possible terms with covariant derivatives can be redened

away at this order [17].

in general, the full open string eective action is given by the sum of the three types
of terms: (i) nbi action (6.8); (ii) f n terms containing factors of commutators of f s; (iii)

terms with symmetrized covariant derivatives of f . while the separation of terms with

symmetrized covariant derivatives is unambiguous, terms from (i) and (ii) have similar

tr(f...f ) structure and their sum reduces to the abelian born-infeld action in the case

when f s commute. it is clear, of course, that there is no reason to expect that the nbi
action (6.8) should reproduce the full string theory expression at higher than 2 orders (i.e.
4f 6 + ...).27 still, the symmetrized trace action has several exceptional features and may
indeed provide a good approximation to string (or d-brane) dynamics in certain situations,

e.g., described by nearly commuting or nearly covariantly constant eld strengths, or by

bps congurations.

6.2. properties of the symmetrized trace action

before discussing some properties and generalizations of the nbi action (6.8) let us

make its denition more explicit. expanding the abelian born-infeld lagrangian in powers
of f we may dene the lorentz tensors cm1n1...m2kn2k as the coecients in28

(6.11)

27 therefore, possible disagreements with predictions of the full string theory eective action
like the one observed in [72] (where quadratic uctuations in a constant abelian fmn background

were discussed both from nbi action and string theory points of view) should not be unexpected.
28 since det( + f ) = det( + f t ) = det(  f ) the expansion of bi and thus of nbi action
contains only even powers of f .

22

here the totally symmetric tensors

da1...ap = str(ta1 ...tap ) 

1
p!

tr(ta1 ...tap + all permutations)

(6.12)

are the (adjoint action) invariant tensors of the gauge lie algebra (pi da1...a

aib =
abtc).29 the denition (6.11) is thus quite natural from the mathematical

point of view.

for example, for su (2) one has ta = a, tatb = ab + iabctc, so that da1...a2n =
2(a1a2 ...a2n1,2n). for su (3) all da1...a2n are expressed in terms of dab  ab and dabc.
the simple structure of da1...a2n in the su (2) case allows one to write down the su (2)

nbi lagrangian in the following form: lnbi(su (2)) =< p det(mn + fmn) >, where
fmn = taf a
< tatb >= 2ab, i.e. < ... > r [dt] exp(tata)....30

mn and the averaging is done over the free gaussian variable ta with the rule

the fact that under str one can eectively treat the factors of f as commuting sim-

plies the analysis of the consequences of the nbi action (see [72,74]). indeed, most of the

properties of the abelian born-infeld action have direct non-abelian analogs in the nbi

action case. in particular, one can show that: (i) covariantly constant elds dmfkl = 0
are solutions of the nbi equations;31
(waves, instantons, monopoles, etc.) as the ym action trf 2

(ii) the nbi action has the same bps solutions
mn [74].32 the nbi action and

29 in general, for su (n ) there are n  1(=rank) basic or primitive tensors da1...ar in terms of
which all other da1...an can be expressed (see, e.g., [73]). the primitive symmetric tensors dene
the casimir operators ir = da1...ar t a1 ...t ar .

30 similar representation might exist for higher su (n ) groups if additional primitive invariant
tensors are added as coupling constants to the action for ta (e.g., dabctatbtc + ...), making it

non-gaussian.

31 the variation of the nbi action is str[ det hkl(h 1)mn(dman  dnam)], where
hmn  mn + fmn. since str (6.12) is the sum of terms with ordinary traces which have
the usial cyclic symmetry, one can always put the term with variation to the right of all oth-

in general, for a set of matrices mi, k one has str(m1...mnk) = tr(m(1...mn)k) where

from the nbi action). monopole solutions in the non-abelian theory combined with higgs sector

were considered in [76].

23

equations of motion reduce33 on such congurations simply to the ym action and the
ym equations dmf mn = 0. as in the abelian case (3.2),(3.3) one can show that in four
(euclidean) dimensions

lnbi = strpdet4(mn + fmn) = strq1 + 1
4 fmnf mn)2 + 1

= strq(1 + 1

2 fmnf mn + 1

16 (fmnf mn)2

4 (fmn  f mn)2 .

(6.13)

however, this formal representation does not mean that the resulting action is expressed

in terms of the two lorentz scalars only: str includes all possible orderings of the fmn
factors.34

the bosonic nbi action admits straightforward supersymmetric extensions generaliz-

ing the abelian actions like (4.1) (see [79]) or (5.1). the non-abelian generalization of (5.3)
or, equivalently, the supersymmetric version of the tr(f 2 + f 4) terms in (6.9) invariant
under -deformed supersymmetry was found in [14].

6.3. non-abelian d-brane actions

the non-abelian actions for clusters of d-branes can be again obtained by dimensional

reduction of the nbi action [68] (cf. (2.3)). as was argued in [31], for a system of n

parallel d-branes the elds (am, xs) become u (n ) matrices and the low-energy maxwell
action is generalized to the d = 10 yang-mills action reduced to p+1 dimensions. the full

action including higher order terms is determined by the dimensional reduction of the open

string eective action with the gauge potential components replaced by the matrix-valued

elds a = (am, as = t xs). this follows directly from the non-abelian generalization
of the partition function approach to the derivation of d-brane actions discussed in [29].

t-duality relates the neumann as and dirichlet aa vertices in the exponent in

z =< tr p exp iz d[xmam(x) + xsas(x)] > .

(6.14)

33 as in the abelian case (3.3), on self-dual conguration det(mn + fmn) reduces to a perfect

square [1 + 1

4 (fmn)2]2.

34 thus the existence of a bps bound similar to (3.3) is not obvious [77] (cf.

[78]). the in-

equality relation for strpdet(...) action needs, in general, a separate proof dierent from the

abelian argument (note also that str-action (6.11) is dened perturbatively and its global prop-

erties depend on convergence of the series). the bps bound seems to hold at least in the su (2)

case as can be seen from the abelian representation lnbi(su (2)) =< p det(mn + fmn) >

mentioned above (the averaging is done with a positive denite measure).

24

in view of the above discussion, in situations when covariant derivatives and their commu-

tators are small, it is natural to assume that the most important part of these corrections

is represented by the nbi action (6.8). then we arrive at the following non-abelian gen-

eralization of (2.3) [68]

sp = tpz dp+1x strq det( + t 1f )
= tpz dp+1x str(cid:20)p detgmnpdetgrs(cid:21) ,

(6.15)

gmn  mn + grs(x)dmxrdnxs + t 1fmn ,

grs(x)  rs  it [xr, xs] .

(6.16)

here str applies not to individual am and xs but to the products of components of the
eld strength f , i.e. frs = it 2[xr, xs] , fmr = t dmxr = t (mxr  i[am, xr]) and
fmn(a) = man  nam  i[am, an]. as in (2.3), we have used the simple determinant
identity (which is applicable under str). compared to the abelian case, now there is a non-
trivial extra factor of the determinant of the internal metric grs(x)  rs  it [xr, xs]
(which is equal to 1 if xs commute).35

there should exist a non-trivial generalization of the action (6.15) to the case when d-

branes are put in a curved background. one natural suggestion is to consider background
elds as functions of xs = xsi +xs where xs is the center of mass coordinate and expand in
power series in su (n ) coordinates xs. for example, for the dilaton interaction tr(f 2
mn)
this leads to p 1
mn) [81,82]. as was pointed out in [83], to
get sym operators from short multiplets of n = 4 superconformal algebra one should
symmetrize products of xs (or of their n = 1 supereld counterparts). this prescription
is also supported and made more universal by the analysis of the supersymmetric versions

n! s1...sn(x)tr(xs1...xsnf 2

of the above higher momentum dilaton operators in [84]. note also that powers of x and
f are related by linearized n = 4 supersymmetry (in particular, str(xxxx) is related
to str(f f f f ) [85,86]). this suggests that in the general external background case the

symmetrized trace in the nbi action should apply to both the components of 10-d eld

strength fmn, dmxs, [xr, xs] and powers of xs in the taylor expansion of the background

elds.

35 some quantum corrections in such non-abelian d-brane actions were discussed in [80].

25

7. derivative corrections to born-infeld action in open superstring theory

the eld strength derivative corrections to the leading born-infeld part of the open

string eective action can be computed using either s-matrix or sigma model (path integral

or beta-function) approach. the advantage of the latter is that though it is based on the

expansion in derivatives kfmn, in the abelian case it is still non-perturbative in powers
of fmn. as explained in [19,20], one may start with the path integral expression (2.1)
or (6.1),(6.3), expand the boundary action in powers of f and compute the resulting

correlators with the fmn-dependent (super)propagator on the disc which in the superstring

case has the form [21,19,20] (cf. (6.2))

gmn = gmn(1, 2|f )  12kmn(1, 2|f )

where we have absorbed 2 into the matrix fmn and (  f 2)mn  mn  fmkklfln.
after the renormalization of the partition function z(a), i.e.
eliminating logarithmic
divergences by a redenition of the vector potential,36 one nds [20] that the resulting

eective superstring lagrangian has the following structure (we again suppress the factors
of 2 which multiply each fmn and each pair of derivatives)

l = p det(mn + fmn)(cid:20)1 + f klmnabcd(f )klfmnabfcd + o(6)(cid:21) ,

(7.2)

where the function f (f )  f 2+f 4+... can be, in principle, computed exactly. the leading
f 2 term in f is easy to nd by comparing this action with the momentum expansion of
the standard expression [5] for the 4-vector superstring amplitude on the disc [20]

l = p det (mn + fmn)

36 this corresponds to subtraction of massless exchanges in the string amplitudes. renormal-
ization scheme ambiguity corresponds to eld redenition ambiguity in the s-matrix approach

[19].

the f f f f term in (7.3) denes a super-invariant which appears also in other con-

texts (e.g., as a divergent 1-loop correction to quantized supersymmetric born-infeld action

[48,49]). starting with (7.3) in 10 dimensions and applying dimensional reduction as in
(2.3),(6.15) one may determine the corresponding higher-derivative string  corrections
to d-brane actions.37

for comparison, in the bosonic string case one nds [19,20]

appendix a. born-infeld action from string partition function on a disc

let us review the original computation [6] of the partition function (2.1) in the abelian

fmn = const background in a slightly generalized form: we shall assume that the boundary

37 note that the o(2x) higher-derivative terms discussed in [87] can be redened away [50]:
the scalar terms in [87] are related by eld redenition and integration by parts to (x)4/x 4
terms which accompany f 4/x 4 terms (cf. (4.28)) in the n = 4 sym 1-loop eective action.

part of the string action contains also the usual particle term ( xm)2. the full (euclidean)

string action on the disc is then

i = z d2 1

d [ 1

2 mmn xm xn  i xmam(x)] .

(a.1)

here mmn may be interpreted as a condensate of the open string massive mode; taken at

an o-shell value mmn = const this term breaks conformal invariance of the sigma model.

in what follows we shall set mmn = m mn and treat this term as a formal regularization

of the boundary kinetic operator. integrating over the values of the string coordinate at

internal points of the disc we arrive at the following eective action at the boundary of
the disc (we isolate the constant zero mode xm

0 = xm  m)

where m = pn=1(amcos n + bmsin n) and the scale-invariant (rst order) non-local

boundary,

(a.3)

the action (a.2) thus contains both eectively rst-order ( t ) and second-order ( m )
derivative parts and interpolates between the string-theory case t 6= 0, m = 0 which
was discussed in [6] and the standard particle case t = 0, m 6= 0 which appeared in the
schwinger computation of log det(d2(a)). the resulting partition function will interpo-
late between the born-infeld (1 + f2) and schwinger ( f

sinh f ) results.

coupling at the boundary. when t = 0 the factors in the product in z12(f, m ) are

linear divergence again absorbed into the tachyon coupling [19]) we get the born-infeld

result z12(m = 0, f ) = p1 + (t 1f)2. when t = 0 we get the schwinger result z12 =

m plays the role of an eective regularization parameter) and is given by a combination

.

(a.7)

this partition function is well-dened for |e| < t + m , which is a generalization of the
critical eld strength condition (|e| < t ) for the born-infeld action.

the general expression for the partition function is thus given by the product of factors

(a.11)

the linearly divergent term cancels out in the superstring case as in (6.7).

the superstring generalization of the action (a.2) contains three extra fermionic

(a.12)

where k is dened in (6.2). as a result, (a.5) is replaced by

m terms
here do not cancel, i.e. in this case the m -regulator does not seem to preserve the world-

volume supersymmetry (the the same conclusion is reached in the case of the exponential

regulator used in (6.2)). at the same time, the formal -function regularization implies

[6,16] that the bosonic factor is the bi one while the fermionic contribution is simply equal
to 1 ((0, 1) = (0) =  1
