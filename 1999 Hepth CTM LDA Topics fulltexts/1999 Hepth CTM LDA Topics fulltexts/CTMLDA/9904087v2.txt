abstract

we compute instanton corrections to the low energy eective prepotential of n = 2
supersymmetric theories in a variety of cases, including all classical gauge groups and even
number of fundamental matter hypermultiplets. to this end, we take prot of a set of rst-
and second-order equations for the logarithmic derivatives of the prepotential with respect
to the dynamical scale expressed in terms of riemanns theta-function. these equations
emerge in the context of the whitham hierarchy approach to the low-energy seiberg
witten solution of supersymmetric gauge theories. our procedure is recursive and allows
to compute the eective prepotential to arbitrary order in a remarkably straightforward
way. general expressions for up to three-instanton corrections are given. we illustrate
the method with explicit expressions for several cases.

1 introduction

some ve years ago, seiberg and witten gave an ansatz for the dominant piece of the
eective action governing the light degrees of freedom of su(2) n = 2 super yang-mills
theory at low energy[1]. it is given in terms of an auxiliary complex algebraic curve c
(whose moduli space is identied with the quantum moduli space of the low-energy theory
m) and a given meromorphic dierential, dssw , that induces a special geometry on m
(see refs.[2] for excellent reviews). the solution was soon extended to other gauge groups
and matter content by determining both the appropriate complex curve and meromorphic
dierential [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], thus leading to a substantial progress in our understanding of
n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories.
in particular, the appearance of an auxiliary
riemann surface made it possible to identify remarkable connections with string theory,
singularity theory of dierentiable maps and integrable systems. the framework that will
be used in this paper is strongly inspired by the latter one.

it is well-known that, as long as n = 2 supersymmetry is unbroken, the low energy
eective action is given in terms of a holomorphic prepotential f . the solution proposed
by seiberg and witten embodies a prescription to compute this prepotential. however,
its explicit evaluation for a given gauge group and matter content is technically involved
and it requires to integrate an expression for the b-periods of dssw as functions of its
a-periods. the complexity of this procedure increases rapidly with the rank of the gauge
group, even without matter hypermultiplets.

whereas perturbative contributions to f are exhausted by one-loop diagrams [8], the
non-perturbative part is given by an innite series of instanton corrections. the impor-
tance of instanton calculus lies precisely in the fact that it provides one of the few non-
perturbative links between the seibergwitten solution and the microscopic non-abelian
eld theory that it is supposed to describe eectively at low energies. from the micro-
scopic point of view, the rst few instanton contributions to the asymptotic semiclassical
expansion of the eective prepotential have been computed for gauge group su(nc), and
a remarkable agreement with the seibergwitten solution has been found [9]. from the
side of the eective theory, several methods for determining the instanton corrections have
been developed in the last few years by using the picardfuchs equations [4, 10], holo-
morphicity arguments [11], analytic continuation [12] (also for non-hyperelliptic curves
[13]), modular anomaly equations [14], etc. among them, we would like to distinguish
those methods that lead to recursion relations for the k-instanton corrections, as long
as they give an implicit expression for the exact solution. for the case of su(2), re-
cursion relations determining the whole instanton expansion have been obtained both in

1

the pure gauge theory [15] and when matter is included [10]. these recursion relations
were obtained by combining the renormalization group and picard-fuchs equations. also
one-instanton corrections for the whole ade series where obtained along the same lines
in [16]. su(nc) with additonal matter in the adjoint representation was considered in
[17] from the point of view of the calogero-moser model, and in [14] (for ade groups
with dual coxeter number kd  6) where the modular anomaly equations of softly broken
n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theories were invoked.

in a recent paper, [18], a new strategy was observed to work very well for the case of
pure su(nc). it is based on a set of rst- and second-order equations for the logarithmic
derivatives of the prepotential with respect to the dynamical scale , evaluated all over
the moduli space

where the dierent quantities entering these expressions will be explained below. each
one of these equations was obtained separately in the last few years by many authors
[15, 19, 20, 21, 22]. it was not until very recently that a unifying approach based on the
whitham hierarchy was shown to be useful to obtain both [23]. in ref.[18], the ansatz for
the semiclassical expansion of the prepotential for gauge group su(nc) was inserted in
both sides of equations (1.1)(1.2) with the result of an elegant and systematic procedure
that allowed us to compute instanton corrections up to any desired order with relatively
little eort. in particular, this method does not require knowledge of the actual solution
for the periods a and ad of dssw , a fact which spares a considerable amount of work.

in this paper we will exhibit the strengh of this method by extending the results of [18]
to any classical gauge group with and without matter content. we shall limit ourselves to
asymptotically free theories. the obvious question arises, about the validity of equations
like (1.2) for all these situations. it turns out that, for our present purposes, the only
constraint which seems to be unavoidable within this method is that massive hypermulti-
plets have to be introduced in pairs, degenerated in mass. this can be understood either
from a purely theoretical study, which we shall leave for a separate paper [24], or else, a
posteriori, for the consistency of the results.

our aim is that this paper could be useful to anyone interested in nding explicit
expressions for the instanton corrections to the eective prepotential of n = 2 supersym-
metric gauge theories. to this end, general formulas for up to three-instanton corrections
will be given and the method to obtain arbitrary higher corrections will be clearly ex-

2

plained. a number of particular examples will be also worked out for the lower rank
groups and small number of avour-pairs, in order to make them easily available for
futher comparison even to other methods or, actually, to the results obtained in the mi-
croscopic non-abelian eld theory. for the one- and two-instanton corrections, our results
coincide with those in the literature while, for most of the three-instanton contributions,
our results are new.

2 recursive evaluation of the eective prepotential

2.1 review and notation

for completeness, we shall start by reviewing the role of the dierent ingredients that
enter the formulas (1.1) and (1.2). the low-energy dynamics of n = 2 supersymmetric
theories with classical gauge group g corresponding to nc colors, and nf hypermultiplets
of mass mf = m(f +nf /2) (i.e. degenerated in masses) in the fundamental representation
of g, can be described in terms of an auxiliary hyperelliptic curve c given by

y2 = (p (, ep) + t (, mf , ))2  4f (, mf ) ,

(2.1)

where p is the characteristic polynomial of g,  is the quantum generated dynamical
scale,  is the coecient of the one-loop n = 2 beta function and ep are the eigenvalues

of the complex scalar eld hi = pp ephp (see ref.[25] for the conventions followed in

the notation of lie group and lie algebra objects) that belongs to the n = 2 vector
supermultiplet in the adjoint of g. t and f are polynomials that do not depend on the
moduli ep and t is dierent from zero only when nf > nc. as pointed out in ref.[12],
when the gauge group is su(nc) or so(nc) all dependence on t can be absorbed in a
redenition of ep, the eective prepotential remaining untouched. thus, we can set t = 0,
and write the hyperelliptic curve c as

y2 = p 2(, ep)  4f (, mf ) .

(2.2)

in the case of sp(nc), there is a residual value for t , t = ncnf +2(qnf /2

in
order to consider all the dierent cases within a unied framework we will neglect this
contribution by setting the mass of one of the degenerated hypermultiplets to zero (say
for example mnf /2 = 0). following ref.[12] this case will be denoted sp(nc), and the
corresponding hyperelliptic curve has the form (2.2) with the proviso that, according to
our previous remark, the number of hypermultiplets will be at least two, nf = n 
f +2  2.

f =1 m2

f ).

consequently, the case of pure sp(nc) will not be attainable from our results though it
is quite simple to make the appropriate modications, as will be explained below. it is
convenient, for later use, to list the form of p , f and  for all classical groups:

as the coecients of hi = aihi in the chevalley basis, hence linearly related to ep (see
ref.[25]). neither of these parameters are invariant under weyl transformations which,
in particular, act by permutation on the ep. on the contrary, the symmetric polynomials

sections of the hyperelliptic curve (2.2); the eective prepotential f is implicitely dened
by the equation

ad i =

f (a)

ai

,

(2.7)

so that its exact determination involves the integration of functions ad i(a) for which
there is not a closed form available. in this context, the existence of an algorithm that
let us determine the exact form of f without going through the actual computation of
ai(uk, mf ) and ad j(uk, mf ) is welcome.

as mentioned above, our rst ingredient is the set of rg equations (1.1)(1.2). strictly
speaking, as they stand, they are valid for the pure gauge theory. in presence of matter,
the rst equation receives an additional term which depends only on the masses and
the second one has to be modied for  = 2 where it receives an additional constant
contribution [24]. in summary1

1 although the addition of an ai-independent terms to f is unphysical from the point of view of the
eective theory, the embedding of the seiberg-witten solution into the whitham dynamics xes them as
a function of the bare coupling 0. a similar behaviour was observed in the study of f near the strong
coupling singularities of su (nc) n = 2 super yangmills theory [26].

{i}i=1,...,r stands for the simple roots of the corresponding classical lie algebra, they
generate the root lattice  = { = nii|ni  z}. the dot product () of two simple roots
i and j gives an element of the cartan matrix, aij = i j, and extends bilinearly to
arbitrary linear combinations of simple roots. so, for example, for any root  = njj  ,
the quantities z are dened by z = a   aiaijnj where a = aii. for non-simply
laced lie algebras this product is not symmetric.

simple roots can be written in terms of the orthogonal set of unit vectors {p}p=1,,lg.
the order parameters ai and ep are related by ep = a p. the exact relations and the
actual values of i  p for each classical gauge group can be found in ref.[25]. finally,
we also have that k j = k
j dene the fundamental weights. in particular, this means

that i = pk aikk. we have also introduced three parameters , + and , so as to

deal with all classical lie algebras within one single ansatz; kd denotes the dual coxeter
number. the particular values of these variables for each classical gauge group are shown
in table 1. the coecient of the one-loop beta function turns out to be given by

it is important to notice that we may shift  g
in (2.11) to any value by appropriately

rescaling , and this will be reected in our choice for the normalization of the fk(z).
we have xed it in all cases to be  g
0 = 3/2kd so that quadratic terms in z do not
contribute to the coupling constant ij (see (2.17) below).

for non-simply laced, the exact form will be given below. in the case  = 2, as we can
see from eq.(2.15) the rst instanton correction acquires a shift f1 = f1 + 1 . it soon
becomes clear that, except for the simplest cases, the concrete evaluation of the fk has to
be carried out by symbolic computation. in the next sections we illustrate our procedure
with explicit examples in several cases for the lower rank groups.

a last word concerning the possibility to split the masses is in order. generically,
all resulting expressions involve powers of the degenerated masses {mf , f = 1, ..., nf /2}.
they must be recovered from the exact result for arbitrary masses in the coincidence limit
mf = mf +nf . the possibility to go back unambiguously only happens for low powers of
mf . as a thumb rule, we have checked in several cases that the following prescription does
the job: for su(nc) and when powers of mf are not higher than 2, mf  1
2 (mf + mf +nf )
and m2
f  mf mf +nf ; while for the rest of the groups and for (even) powers of mf not
higher than 4, m2
. typically these cases only
occur in f1. another way to see this is to observe that if we write down f1 in terms of
the qi(mf ), f = 1, ..nf /2 as given in (2.22), these factors always appear precisely in those
combinations that build up the tk = tk(qi) as given in (2.4), which are valid for arbitrary
masses.

3 results for simply-laced lie algebras

we start by giving the concrete expression for z(g) = nih(0)

2,i . in the case of ar and

p = aiajaij and also that + = 1. hence

dr lie algebras, we have that pp e2

z(g) = nih0

epiep = niajaij = a = z

2,i = nixp

we shall dene 0 = q+ z 2

+ . to avoid confusion we must mention that, although we
have expressed all results in terms of weyl invariant polynomial combinations uk(ai), for
notational clearness we shall drop the bar.

3.1 su (r + 1) with nf hypermultiplets

the only asymptotically free theories that we can consider within our approach, for these
groups, are nf = 2, . . . , 2r. let us list some of the results that we have obtained by using
our formulas (we omit the case of su(nc) whithout matter which can be found in [18]):

3.1.1 su (2)

nf = 2 using u2 = a2, we found the following corrections:

f1 =

u2 + m2

2u2

(3.1)

f2 =

f3 =

,

5u2

2m2  14u2m4 + 9m6

192u5
2

.

(3.2)

(3.3)

the one- and two-instanton contributions coincide with those computed in [12] (after
adjusting  to /2). in the one-instanton correction, as discussed before, it is possible
to split the masses, m2  m1m2, so that the result for non-degenerated (nd) matter
hypermultiplets is

f1,n d =

u2 + m1m2

2u2

,

(3.4)

in agreement with the result in ref.[12]. also, the case of one hypermultiplet can then
be considered by letting m2   while keeping m2 nite an equal to the square of the
dynamical scale 2 that corresponds to nf = 1.

3.1.2 su (3)

to express our results, we introduce weyl invariant combinations in terms of the ai-
variables, u2 = a2
2  a1a2 and u3 = a1a2(a1  a2). for the case nf = 4, we will denote
q1 = m1 + m2 and q2 = m1m2. we obtained:

f1 = (2u2

again, the splitting of the one-instanton correction can be done by letting m2  m1m2
and m  (m1 + m2)/2,

f1,n d = (2u2

2 + 6m1m2u2  9(m1 + m2)u3)/0 ,

(3.8)

and the reduction of hypermultiplets mentioned above is immediate. our results (3.5),
(3.6) and (3.8) agree with those obtained in [12].

nf = 4

f1 = (2u3

2  9u2

3  6q1u2u3 + 2(q2

1 + 2q2)u2

2 + 6q2

2u2  18q1q2u3)/0 ,

(3.9)

and the length of the expressions growths rapidly. again, having in mind that f1,n d
should be linear in the polynomials of the masses it is possible to carefully split the
masses, m2
2  m2m4, m1  (m1 + m3)/2 and m2  (m2 + m4)/2 (or, in
terms of the polynomials of the masses, 2q1  t1, q2
2  t4)
so that

1 + 2q2  t2, 2q1q2  t3 and q2

1  m1m3, m 2

f1,n d = (2u3

2  9u2

3  3t1u2u3 + 2t2u2

2  9t3u3 + 6t4u2)/0 ,

(3.10)

and then one can reduce it to an odd number of matter hypermultiplets in the way
mentioned before [12].

3.1.3 su (4)

as the expressions become too long, we will only display the one-instanton correction.
to express our results, we introduce the classical values of the weyl invariant casimirs
u2 = a2

3.2 so(2r) with nf hypermultiplets

the only asymptotically free theories that we can consider within our approach, for these
groups, are nf = 0, 2, . . . , 2(r  2). notice that the case nf = 0 corresponds to vanishing
values of + and  in (2.11), which in the formulas of the instanton corrections implies
r = 1. let us list some of the result one can easily obtain by using our formulas:

3.2.1 so(4)

for this group the classical values of the casimir operators in terms of the ai are given by
u2 = 2a2

again, the splitting of the masses is possible for the one-instanton correction. this hap-

the one-instanton corrections agree with those computed in ref.[12].

4 results for non simply-laced lie algebras

4.1 so(2r + 1) with nf hypermultiplets

in this case the form of z(g) is dierent from the simply-laced cases. indeed, using the
fact that

iq = i,q  i+1,q

r q = 2r,q ,

and setting + = 1, we have

so(2r), to take in (2.11) + =  = 0 which in the formulas of the instanton corrections
means to set r = 1. let us list some of the results that we have obtained:

in this subsection we are going to consider the case of sp(2r), i.e., the case of sp(2r)
with two massless hypermultiplets and n

the form of z(g) is, as in the case of so(2r + 1), dierent from the simply-laced cases.

4.3 the case of pure sp(2r)

as we discussed above, the case of sp(2r) without matter hypermultiplets cannot be
obtained from our previous formulas, as long as we are considering at least two massless
hypermultiplets. nevertheless, one can treat this case separately in an analogous way. in
fact, we can x our ansatz for the eective prepotential (2.11) to the one rst considered
by ito and sasakura [27] by setting

 = 1

+ =  = 0

and

0 = 3 .

(4.23)

now, we can introduce the eective prepotential into eq.(2.9) and the same kind of
formulas for the instanton correction would be obtained, provided we have for this case a

characteristic e =h 0,...,0

we also need the value of z(g) which turns out to be the same as that in sp(2r),

2i. note that, being nf = 0, we must set r = 1 in our formulas.

the one-instanton corrections agree with those computed in ref.[27].

5 concluding remarks

in the present paper, we have shown how instanton corrections to the eective prepo-
tential of n = 2 supersymmetric theories can be computed in a variety of cases including
all classical gauge groups and even number of degenerated fundamental matter hyper-
multiplets, up to arbitrary order. as compared to other approaches developed in the
literature, we should stress that the one presented in this paper has an important feature
in that it does not require an explicit knowledge of the bps spectrum as a function of the
moduli, at the same time that it allows to consider a huge variety of cases within a unied
framework. also, being recursive, it admits an easy implementation on a computer. we
have illustrated the remarkable simplicity of our procedure by displaying many explicit
expressions which should be quite useful for further comparison with the results obtained
by other means.

conversely, our results admit a second reading: they could be thought of as a highly
non-trivial test of the connection between the seibergwitten solution to the low energy

20

dynamics of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories, and the theory of whitham (adia-
batic) deformations of a given integrable system [18, 23]. in this sense, it is important
to remind that the new equation (2.9), which is a key ingredient of our procedure, is
originated in the latter framework, as it is shown in detail in ref.[24].

aside from being an interesting mathematical problem by itself, the embedding of
the seiberg-witten solution within a whitham hierarchy seems to be the appropriate
framework for the study of many physical phenomena. for example, the so-called slow
whitham times can be consistently thought of as spurion vector supermultiplets that can
be used to break n = 2 supersymmetry down to n = 0 with non-quadratic casimir
operators [18].
in this way, the whitham hierarchy can be interpreted as a family of
supersymmetry breaking deformations of the original theory associated with the higher
casimir operators of the gauge group. this issue generalizes to the n = 0 case the family
of n = 1 supersymmetry breaking terms considered, for instance, in ref.[28].

the key feature of the whitham formalism lies on the fact that, as the dependence on
the slow times is encoded in the prepotential, it is possible to obtain the exact eective
potential of the theory, in the spirit of [18, 29]. this allows to perform a detailed study,
both qualitative and quantitative, of the vacuum state of the theory once supersymmetry is
broken, as well as of the appearance of monopole condensates, mass gaps, etc. preliminary
results on this program were published in ref.[18]. the formalism is even useful near the
argyresdouglas singularities, where non-local degrees of freedom become simultaneously
massless, provided one approaches them along any of the submanifolds where a unique
monopole gets massless [18].

there is another place where deformations of the prepotential by means of the whitham
times are relevant. it is the study of contact terms in the twisted version of n = 2 gauge
theories, where these new variables play the role of sources for insertions of certain class
of operators in the generating functional [19, 20, 30, 31].

another interesting point is given by the uses of our starting equations (2.8)(2.9)
to study the strong coupling expansion of the prepotential near the singularities of the
quantum moduli space, as it was done in ref.[26] for the case of pure su(nc). in par-
ticular, these equations provide us with a set of non-trivial constraints that facilitate the
study of the couplings between dierent magnetic photons, originally found in ref.[32],
that take place at such points. the expansion of the prepotential near the maximal points
by other methods, as the deformations of the auxiliary singular riemann manifold [33],
is not sensitive to such kind of terms.

several interesting questions remain open aside from the ones just mentioned. for
example, the case of arbitrary masses cannot be treated within our approach, except

21

for the one-instanton correction (which, on the other hand, is enough for leading order
comparison purposes).
in fact, from the whitham hierarchy side, one can show that
indeed the formulas used in this paper are insucient to tackle the generic scenario,
though it seems to be possible to rene the formalism in order to extend its applicability
to some cases of unpaired masses [24]. the additional corrections that appear in the
generic case are, nevertheless, quite dicult to manage with. finally, another avenue for
future research is, certainly, the connection of this formalism with the string theory and
d-brane approach to supersymmetric gauge theories, where some steps has already been
given in the last few years [34].

we believe that these matters deserve further study.
