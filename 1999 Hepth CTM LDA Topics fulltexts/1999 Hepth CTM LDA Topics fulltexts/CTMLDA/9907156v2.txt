abstract

we show that cpn sigma model solitons solve the eld equations of a dirac-born-
infeld (dbi) action and, furthermore, we prove that the non-bps soliton/anti-soliton
solutions of the sigma model also solve the dbi equations. using the moduli space
approximation we compare the dynamics of the bps sigma model solitons with that
of the associated dbi solitons. we nd that for the cp1 case the metric on the
moduli space of sigma model solitons is identical to that of the moduli space of dbi
solitons, but for cpn with n > 1 we show that the two metrics are not equal. we
also consider the possibility of similar non-bps solitons in other dbi theories.

1 introduction

the low energy dynamics of branes in strings and m-theory can be described by actions
of dirac-born-infeld (dbi) type [1]. the various classical solutions of these actions admit
a geometric interpretation in terms of brane congurations. in fact most of these solutions
have a bulk interpretation as intersecting branes [2]. the part of the dbi d-brane action
which is quadratic in the derivatives of the elds can be identied with a yang-mills theory
coupled to matter. this has led to a relation between intersecting brane congurations
and classical solutions of yang-mills theories. one of the applications of this relation is
that some classical and quantum properties of yang-mills theory can be understood as
geometric properties of brane congurations [3].

the elds of dbi type actions are scalars, vectors or tensors. in certain cases, there
is a consistent truncation of the dbi action for which the vector and tensor elds are not
active1. the remaining elds are scalars and the action reduces to a dirac one (or nambu-
goto for the string case). then powerful geometrical methods can be used to investigate
static congurations, like those of (generalized) calibrations [4, 5]. in particular, bounds
for the energy can be established and the solutions which saturate them can be found.
the part of this reduced dbi action which is quadratic in the derivatives of the scalars
is that of a non-linear sigma model. so the possibility arises to interpret various sigma
model solitons in terms of brane congurations and to relate the calibration bounds to
sigma model ones. an example was presented in [6, 7], where the sigma model lumps
and q-kinks were understood in terms of m-2-brane congurations. in particular it was
observed that the sigma model energy bound associated with lumps on a taub-nut target
space is related to the kahler calibration bound in the eective theory of the m-2-brane in
the presence of a kaluza-klein (kk)-monopole. moreover, it was found that the solutions
that saturate the sigma model bound also solve the corresponding bound of dbi. in this
way the sigma model lumps were embedded in the eective theory of the m-2-brane.

it is expected that other sigma model solitons can be embedded in a brane theory,
although there are several restrictions on the sigma model target space required by the
consistency of the background due to kappa symmetry. furthermore, for a dbi action it is
far from clear that solutions of the sigma model eld equations will also solve the dbi eld
equations since the former is just an approximation of the latter. however, this appears to
be the case for a large class of solutions that saturate certain sigma model energy bounds.
this is probably due to supersymmetry which protects them against higher derivative
corrections. however, as we shall demonstrate, there are sigma model solutions that do
not saturate a bound which are also solutions of dbi equations without any modication.
a large class of (2+1)-dimensional sigma models are those with target spaces the com-
plex projective spaces cpn. since cpn is a kahler manifold, these sigma models admit a
supersymmetric extension with n = 2 supersymmetry in three dimensions (n = 1 super-
symmetry in four dimensions) and they are described by chiral superelds. the energy of
the static sigma model congurations is bounded by the topological central charge of the

1a eld is active in a solution, if it has a non-trivial dependence on the brane worldvolume coordinates.

supersymmetry algebra. the congurations that saturate this bound are solitons which
can be thought of as holomorphic curves in cpn. many of the properties of these soli-
tons have been extensively investigated, including their low energy scattering [8] as well
as soliton/anti-soliton annihilation using numerical and other methods [9]. another novel
class of solutions of cpn sigma models are those describing unstable soliton/anti-soliton
states, which of course do not saturate the above bound [10, 11].

in this paper, we consider a dbi action with target space cpn. such a dbi action
admits an energy bound associated with a degree two kahler calibration. the part of the
dbi action which is quadratic in the derivatives of the elds can be identied with the
cpn sigma model. the calibrated submanifolds that saturate the bound are holomorphic
submanifolds of r2cpn and these are precisely the static solitons of the (2+1)-dimensional
cpn sigma model. in addition, we shall show that the soliton/anti-soliton solutions of the
cpn sigma model are also solutions of the dbi action. these solutions saturate neither
the sigma model nor the kahler calibration bounds.

using the moduli space approximation, we compare the low energy dynamics of bps
sigma model solitons with that of the associated dbi solitons and we nd that they may
dier. finally, we investigate the possibility of other non-bps solitons in dbi theories.

2 the cpn sigma model

in this section we briey review some properties of the (2+1)-dimensional sigma model
with target space cpn (for more details see eg. [11]). for this, we begin with the description
a (2+1)-dimensional sigma model with target space any kahler manifold m equipped with
a metric h and compatible complex structure k. the sigma model elds are maps x from
r(1,2) into m. the energy of a static sigma model conguration (x : r2  m) is

where i, j = 1, 2 and i, j = 1, . . . , dimm. then

e =

1

2 z d2xhij ijix ijx j

e =



1

4 z d2x hij ij (ix i  k
2 z d2x (k)ij ijix ijx j ,

ik i

1

lkx l)(jx j  

jk j

m x m )

where  is the levi-civita tensor and k is the kahler form of k. so we nd

e  2|q|

where

q =

1

4 z d2x(k)ijijix ijx j

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

is the topological charge since k is a closed form. clearly, the congurations that saturate
the bound satisfy

ix i  k

ik i

jkx j = 0 .

(2.5)

3

this is the cauchy-riemann equation and the solutions are holomorphic curves in the
kahler manifold m.

for m = cpn, the sigma model elds x can be parameterized by a complex (n + 1)-
component column vector u, of unit length ie. u u = 1. the sigma model lagrangian is
given by

(2.6)
where dv = v  (u u)v. greek indices run over the spacetime values 0,1,2 and
we use the minkowski metric  = (1, 1, 1). the sigma model equation of motion which
follows from (2.6) is

l = (du)(du)

ddu + (du)(du)u = 0

(2.7)

and all nite energy solutions are classied by the integer valued topological charge (2.4),
which in this parameterization is given by

q =

i

2 z d2x jk(dju)(dku) .

the congurations that saturate the bound satisfy

the bps soliton solutions are easily constructed as

dju = ik

jdku.

u =

f
|f |

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

where f is any vector whose components are rational functions of the complex coordinate
z = x1 + ix2. the topological charge q is positive in this case and is equal to the highest
degree of the rational functions which occur in the entries of f . the anti-soliton solutions,
which have negative topological charge, are obtained in the same way but with f an anti-
holomorphic function of z.

there are also non-bps solutions, ie. solutions of the second order equations (2.7)
which are not solutions of the rst order equations (2.9), and therefore do not saturate the
energy bound [10, 11]. all these solutions can be obtained explicitly by making use of the
operator p+ acting on a general vector g as

the non-bps solutions are then given by a repeated application of this operator

p+g = zg  (gzg)

g
|g|2 .

u =

p k
+f
|p k
+f |

,

k = 0, .., n

(2.11)

(2.12)

starting with any initial holomorphic vector f. the operator p+ can only be applied n
times, since after this number of applications the original holomorphic vector is converted
into an anti-holomorphic vector and p+ annihilates anti-holomorphic vectors. thus this
operator converts bps solitons into bps anti-solitons, but intermediate solutions with
0 < k < n correspond to non-bps soliton/anti-soliton congurations. note that in the
case of the cp1 model the operator can be applied only once and converts bps soliton
solutions to bps anti-soliton solutions, so there are no non-bps solutions in this case.

3 the cpn dbi model

to dene the cpn dbi model we begin with the spacetime r(1,2)  cpn with metric

ds2 = ds2(r(1,2)) + ds2(cpn)

(3.1)

where ds2(cpn) is the fubini-study metric on cpn. we then consider a (2+1)-dimensional
embedded submanifold on which the action is obtained as the worldvolume of the induced
metric obtained by pulling back the spacetime metric (3.1) to the embedded submanifold.
explicitly,

idbi = z d3xqdet()

(3.2)

where  is the induced metric ie. the pull back of ds2 to the submanifold. we choose
the static gauge, in which the spacetime coordinates of the submanifold are identied with
the r(1,2) part of the spacetime metric, and then clearly the part of the action (3.2) which
is quadratic in the derivatives of the scalars can be identied with the action of the cpn
sigma model described in the previous section. in the above dbi action we have set the
born-infeld eld to zero, which is a consistent truncation.

as in the case of the cpn sigma models in the previous section, we shall seek static

solutions of this system. the energy2 of such solutions is

edbi = z d2xqdet(ij),

(3.3)

where ij is the pull back of the spatial part of the metric (3.1). the solutions that minimize
the energy are minimal surfaces in r2  cpn. since r2  cpn is a kahler manifold, it is
well known that there is a bound for the energy which is described by a kahler calibration.
in particular

where q is a topological charge induced by pulling back the kahler form

edbi  2|q|

 = dx1  dx2 + k

(3.4)

(3.5)

onto the embedded submanifold, and k is the kahler form on cpn. the congurations
that saturate the bound are holomorphic curves in r2  cpn. so we nd that the cong-
urations that saturate the energy bound of the sigma model also saturate the calibration
bound for the dbi solitons.

in terms of the parameterization, as a unit length column vector u, introduced in the

previous section for the sigma model, the dbi lagrangian becomes

ldbi = qdet( + (du)(du) + (du)(du))  1

and the static energy is

edbi = z d2xqdet(ij + (diu)(dju) + (dju)(diu))  1

2this energy functional arises naturally in the calibration bound and includes the vaccum energy.

(3.6)

(3.7)

5

where we have now subtracted o the vacuum energy.

in this formulation it is an easy exercise to verify the energy bound (3.4), where edbi
and q are given by (3.7) and (2.8) respectively, and to show that the sigma model solitons,
given by (2.10) with f a holomorphic (or anti-holomorphic) function, saturate this bound.

4 non-bps dbi solitons

we shall now nd that, remarkably, the non-bps sigma model solitons are also solutions
of the dbi eld equations. to prove this we begin by computing the dbi eld equations
for static congurations that follow from the variation of (3.6). after a little algebra we
nd that the static eld equations are

di{

= 

(diu )[1 + 2(dj u )(dj u )]  (dj u )[(diu )(dj u ) + (dj u )(diu )]

u {(diu )(diu )[1 + 2(dj u )(dj u )]  (diu )(dj u )[(diu )(dj u ) + (dj u )(diu )]}.

q1 + 2(dl u )(dlu )[1 + (dku )(dk u )]  (dlu )(dku )[(dlu )(dku ) + (dku )(dlu )]
q1 + 2(dlu )(dlu )[1 + (dku )(dku )]  (dlu )(dku )[(dl u )(dku ) + (dk u )(dlu )]

}

(4.1)

it is convenient to introduce the notation tij  (diu)(dju) and rewrite equation (4.1)
in the form

d1{

d2{

(d1u)(1 + 2t22)  (d2u)(t12 + t21)

(d2u)(1 + 2t11)  (d1u)(t12 + t21)

q1 + 2t11 + 2t22 + 4t11t22  (t12 + t21)2
q1 + 2t11 + 2t22 + 4t11t22  (t12 + t21)2
q1 + 2t11 + 2t22 + 4t11t22  (t12 + t21)2

u[t11 + t22 + 4t11t22  (t12 + t21)2]

next we observe that if we impose the following constraints

t11 = t22, t12 = t21

then equations (4.2) can be simplied to

d1d1u + d2d2u + u(t11 + t22) = 0

} +

} +

= 0.

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

which are exactly the sigma model eld equations for static congurations (2.7). thus if
we can nd static solutions of the sigma model equations which also satisfy the constraints
(4.3) then they will also be static solutions of the dbi equations. the bps solitons solve
the equations (2.9) and so automatically obey the constraints (4.3) (and have the additional

6

property that t12 = it11). we shall now show that the sigma model non-bps solitons
also satisfy the constraints.

in terms of the complex variable z = x1 + ix2 the pair of real equations (4.3) can be

written as the single complex equation

(dzu)(dzu) = 0.

(4.5)

from the denition of p+, given by (2.11), the following properties may be proved (see eg.
[11]) when f is a holomorphic vector,

(p k

+f ) p l

+f = 0,

z(cid:16)p k

+f(cid:17) = p k1

+ f

k 6= l

|p k
+f |2
|p k1
+ f |2

,

+ f

z  p k1

+ f |2! =

|p k1

(4.6)

(4.7)

p k
+f
|p k1
+ f |2

.

using these properties it is elementary to show that if u is a non-bps solution given by
(2.12) then

dzu =

p k+1
+ f
|p k
+f |

, dzu = p k1
+ f

+f |

|p k
|p k1
+ f |2

.

(4.8)

hence equation (4.5) follows immediately from the orthogonality property (4.6). this
completes the proof that the non-bps solitons are also solutions of the dbi model.

these non-bps solutions have the interpretation of soliton/anti-soliton states just as
in the sigma model. as in the sigma model [11] these solutions are therefore expected to
be unstable congurations. the global properties of such solutions as submanifolds of cpn
have been investigated in [12].

the reader may wonder if it is possible to see why the non-bps solitons solve the
dbi equations directly from the lagrangian. of course, in general it is inconsistent to
substitute constraints in the lagrangian since the critical points of the constrained system
are generally not critical points of the full theory. for bps solitons this is not a concern
because they saturate the energy bound and so are automatically critical points.
it is
therefore enough to show that the dbi lagrangian reduces to the sigma model lagrangian
when the bps constraints are imposed. however, non-bps solutions require a little more
thought.

as we want to investigate when the dbi lagrangian (or equivalently energy density
since we are dealing with the static sector) reduces to that of the sigma model then we
compute that

(1 + e)2  (1 + edbi)2

= (1 + t11 + t22)2  (1 + 2t11 + 2t22 + 4t11t22  (t12 + t21)2)
= (t11  t22)2 + (t12 + t21)2.

(4.9)

in the nal line we recognize the constraints (4.3) and there are two crucial points to
be noted. the dbi energy density is identical to that of the sigma model if and only if

7

the constraints (4.3) hold. the rst point is that these constraints are weaker than the
bps equations and have more solutions, in particular we have shown that the non-bps
solitons satisfy the constraints. the second point is that the above expression is quadratic
in the constraints, so its variation is proportional to the constraints and vanishes after their
imposition. this explains why the critical points of the constrained system, which is the
sigma model, are also critical points of the full dbi theory.

5 sigma model vs dbi dynamics

as we have seen, static sigma model bps solitons also solving the dbi eld equations.
it is therefore natural to compare the dynamics of slowly moving bps solitons in the sigma
model and in the dbi model, using the moduli space approximation [13]. naively it might
be expected that the low energy dynamics of bps solutions in the two theories will be
the same since they have the same low energy limit. however, the agreement of the two
lagrangians is to quadratic order in all the derivatives of the elds ie. space and time,
whereas the moduli space approximation assumes that time derivatives are small but there
is no truncation of the spatial derivatives. thus it is not clear whether the dynamics of
the dbi solitons will match that of the sigma model solitons. the moduli space of sigma
model solitons is a kahler manifold [14].

the moduli space approximation truncates the full eld dynamics to motion on the
bps soliton moduli space. applying the bps soliton equation (2.9) the dbi lagrangian
(3.2) can be written as

ldbi = q(1 + 2t11)(1 + 2t11  2t00  4(t11t00  t01t10))  1

(5.1)

where the notation is as in section four. expanding out the square root and neglecting
terms which are higher order than quadratic in the time derivatives, we obtain, after the
integration over space

ldbi = 2|q| z d2x(t00 + 2(t11t00  t01t10)) .

(5.2)

the rst term is just the potential energy of a charge q soliton and the remaining term
denes a metric on the q-soliton moduli space, with respect to which the dynamics is
approximated by geodesic motion. the rst term in the integrand is the kinetic energy of
the sigma model, thus the metric on the moduli space of dbi solitons will be equal to that
of the sigma model solitons if and only if the term (which we now write out in full)

k  2z {(d1u)(d1u)(d0u)(d0u)  (d0u)(d1u)(d1u)(d0u)} d2x

(5.3)

vanishes or is equal to a total time derivative.

for the cp1 model this term is indeed zero. the easiest way to see this is to choose
the parameterization (which can be done without loss of generality using the local u(1)

8

symmetry)

in terms of which it is easily found that

u =

1

q1 + |w|2 (cid:18) 1
w(cid:19)
(1 + |w|2)3/2 (cid:18)  w
1 (cid:19) .

w

du =

(5.4)

(5.5)

thus d0u is proportional to d1u and hence the integrand in (5.3) is identically zero.
however, this cancellation is a unique property of the cp1 case and derives from the fact
that it has only one (complex) eld.

to demonstrate that in the cpn model with n > 1 the term (5.3) can be non-zero it is
enough to consider the cp2 case (since cp2 is a totally geodesic submanifold of cpn for
n > 2). writing the cp2 eld as

then

1

u =

1
w1
w2


q1 + |w1|2 + |w2|2 


k = z 2|0w1zw2  0w2zw1|2

(1 + |w1|2 + |w2|2)3

d2x.

(5.6)

(5.7)

if either w1 or w2 are identically zero then this term vanishes, corresponding to the em-
bedding of cp1 inside cp2, but generally (5.7) is non-zero. finally, we need to check that
this term is not a total time derivative, otherwise it would not contribute to the geodesic
equations. the easiest way to show this is by a simple example.
an axially symmetric cp2 soliton of charge q has the form

w1 = zq  , w2 = zq + 

(5.8)

where  and  are complex parameters related to the size and shape of the soliton [15].
taking  and  to be time dependent the integrand in (5.7) is axially symmetric and the
integration is elementary to arrive at

k =

2q|0|2
(1 + 2||2)2

(5.9)

which is clearly not a total time derivative.

one expects that in a supersymmetric extension the cpn dbi solitons for n > 1 break
more supersymmetry3 than those in cp1. because of this, the above observation regarding
the low energy dynamics of solitons, is related to a similar observation in [16] that the small
perturbations around supersymmetric solitons that preserve less than 1/4 of the maximal

3we remark that the corresponding sigma model solitons always break half of the supersymmetry of

the n = 2 (2+1)-dimensional sigma model.

9

spacetime supersymmetry in the maxwell theory-sigma model approximation of the dbi
action do not solve the perturbed dbi eld equations. however if the solutions preserve
1/4 of spacetime supersymmetry, then the perturbations of the maxwell theory-sigma
model approximation also solve the perturbed dbi eld equations. this indicates that for
bps solitons which preserve enough supersymmetry, supersymmetry protects the sigma
model soliton moduli metric from higher derivative corrections.

in summary we have shown that for cp1 the slow motion dynamics of dbi solitons is
identical to that of the sigma model solitons, but for n > 1 the dynamics of slowly moving
cpn dbi solitons is dierent from that of the sigma model solitons. this is despite the
fact that the low energy truncation of the dbi lagrangian gives the sigma model one and
that the bps solutions of the two systems are the same.

6 non-bps born-infeld field congurations

the investigation of the relation between bps and non-bps solutions of dbi theory
and those of sigma models, that we have described, can be extended to include the relation
between bps and non-bps solutions of dbi theory and those of yang-mills coupled to
matter systems. recently su(n) monopole solutions have been constructed which solve the
second order yang-mills-higgs equations but are not solutions of the rst order bogomolny
equations. not only are these solutions three-dimensional analogues of the non-bps cpn1
sigma model solutions but in fact the sigma model solutions are used explicitly to obtain the
monopoles [17]. an obvious candidate in the search for non-bps dbi solitons is therefore
to consider a system of n parallel d3-branes in type iib string theory, since its low energy
truncation reproduces the yang-mills-higgs lagrangian. however, we shall make a simple
observation that suggests that the non-bogomolny yang-mills-higgs monopoles will not
be solutions of the dbi equations in this case. this in fact may not be a surprise. for
example, in [18] it has been observed that even some bps solutions of yang-mills theory
do not solve the born-infeld eld equations.

although the eective action of a single d3-brane in type iib string theory is described
by an abelian dbi lagrangian a system of n parallel d3-branes is expected to be described
by a u(n) dbi theory, the most promising of which is the proposal of tseytlin [19]. in the
static case, with one active adjoint scalar, the energy density of the d3-brane worldvolume
theory can be conveniently written as [20]

ebi = str(qdet(ab + fab)  1)

(6.1)

where a, b go from 1 to 4 and a dimensional reduction is performed in the x4 direction
with the usual identication of the scalar eld as  = a4. the gauge group is su(n) (an
overall u(1) factor decouples as the centre of mass) and str denotes the trace over gauge
indices of the weighted sum over all permutations of the non-commutative products [19].
this is required in order to make sense of the ordering ambiguities involved in computing
the determinant.

are also solutions of the born-infeld theory (6.1), which can be shown by noting that the
two energies (6.1) and (6.2) are equal upon substitution of the bogomolny equation [20, 21].
the charge k monopole solution describes k d-strings stretched between the n d3-branes
and this can be seen explicitly by graphing the eigenvalues of the scalar eld  over r3
[20].

in order to determine whether the non-bogomolny monopole solutions [17] of (6.2) are
solutions of the born-infeld theory we follow the procedure given in (4.9) for the sigma
model case, and compute when the yang-mills-higgs and dirac-born-infeld energies agree.
ignoring the trace operation and treating the matrices as if they were abelian (which can
be justied using the symmetrized trace [20, 21]) we compute that

2[(1 + ey m h)2  (1 + ebi)2] = (d2d3 + f12f13)2 + (d1d3 + f21f23)2
+(d1d2 + f31f32)2 + (d2f12 + d3f13)2 + (d1f21 + d3f23)2

(6.4)

as in the sigma model case, (4.9), we nd that the result can again be written as a sum of
squares, but this time there is an important dierence in that the constraints (under which
the two energies agree) now contain the bogomolny equations (6.3) explicitly (see the last
three terms). thus in this case, in contrast to the sigma model example, the constraints
are solved only by the bogomolny monopoles. although this does not prove that the non-
bogomolny monopoles do not solve the born-infeld theory, it strongly suggests that they
do not and certainly shows that the feature of non-bps solitons in the sigma model does
not apply in the same way to this example.

7 concluding remarks

we have shown that the cpn sigma model bps solitons also solve the eld equations of
a dirac-born-infeld action. furthermore, we have shown that certain non-bps cpn sigma
model solutions, which correspond to soliton/anti-soliton congurations, are also solutions
of the dirac-born-infeld action. we have also investigated the dynamics of the cpn dbi
solitons and found that they do not coincide with the sigma model dynamics unless n = 1.
finally, we explored the possibility of similar non-bps solutions in yang-mills theories.

11

the possible d-brane interpretation of our results remains an open problem. although
it is expected that some sigma model solitons can be embedded in a brane theory there
are several restrictions on the dbi action, such as kappa symmetry.
in particular, this
implies that the sigma model target space should be a solution of the supergravity eld
equations. since there are no supergravity solutions which are topologically cpn then it
is not obvious that any of our solutions have a d-brane interpretation. however, there
are several possibilities which may admit a d-brane interpretation. for example, the near
horizon geometry of the m-2-brane is ads4  s7 and since s7 is a circle bundle over cp3
then by a kaluza-klein reduction along the circle bre it is possible to obtain a background
which includes cp3[22]. our sigma model solitons can be embedded as solutions in this case
but unfortunately this requires a singular embedding and so there is no obvious d-brane
interpretation for this example.
