study of magnetic monopoles in the original version of born-infeld (bi)

emerge and they include exotic behavior of radial electric monopole eld such

as its regularity as r  0 and its changing behavior with the absence or

presence of the radial magnetic monopole eld. this last point has been

interpreted as the manifestation of the existence of point-like dyons in abelian

bi theory. two pieces of clear evidences in favor of this dyon interpretation are

provided. it is also demonstrated that despite these unique features having

no analogue in standard maxwell theory, the cherished dirac quantisation

i. introduction

recently, the born-infeld (bi) theory has received much attention since the bi-type la-

grangians naturally appear in string theories. namely, it has been realized that they can

describe the low energy dynamics of d-branes [2]. and this state of aair triggered the

revival of interest in the original bi electromagnetism [1] and further the exploration of bi

gauge theories [2] in general. indeed, in spite of its long history this theory has remained

almost unnoticed and hence nearly uncovered. this theory may be thought of as a highly

nonlinear generalization of or a non-trivial alternative to the standard maxwell theory of

electromagnetism. it is known that born and infeld had been led, when they rst constructed

this theory, by the considerations such as ; niteness of the energy in electrodynamics, nat-

ural recovery of the usual maxwell theory as a linear approximation and the hope to nd

soliton-like solutions representing point-like charged particles. in this respect, it seems that

this theory, aside from its connection to the recently fashionable brane physics [2], deserves

serious and full exploration in modern eld theory perspective. and it is precisely this line

of thought that initiated the present study. namely in this work, we would like to perform

the study of magnetic monopole in the original version of pure abelian bi gauge theory [1].

to be a little more concrete, we shall introduce the magnetic charge current density in bi

equations just as dirac did in maxwell equations and see if this introduction can provide

the bi equations with dual symmetry. although this turns out not to be the case, we nd

that the abelian bi gauge theory exhibits unique features which have no analogues in the

standard maxwell theory. that is, due to the lack of dual symmetry, the static electric

monopole eld and the static magnetic monopole eld have dierent r-dependences. to

be more specic, the static electric monopole eld shows exotic behaviors such as the reg-

ularity as r  0 signaling the niteness of the energy stored in the eld of electric point

charge. when both electric and magnetic monopoles are present (and are located, say, at

the same point), surprises continue and particularly the behavior of electric monopole eld

in the presence of the magnetic monopole becomes dierent from that in the absence of the

magnetic monopole. obviously, this can be attributed to the highly non-linear nature of the

3

bi theory action which then results in the direct and unique coupling between the electric

and magnetic elds in a highly non-trivial manner even in the static case and hence is a

really unique feature having no analogue in the usual maxwell theory. we then interpret

this exotic behavior of monopole elds in the presence of both electric and magnetic charges

arising from the unique coupling between electric and magnetic elds as the manifestation

of the existence of dyons even in abelian bi gauge theory.

indeed two pieces of clear

evidences in favor of the dyon interpretation will be provided and one of which employs the

argument based on the translations of monopole elds and the other invokes the energetics

argument. finally, we shall point out that despite all theses unique features of monopoles

and dyons in bi electrodynamics, something seems never change and that is the cherished

dirac quantisation condition and the meaning that underlies it. one might wonder how the

dyon solutions found in this work should be understood in relation to the soliton solutions

dubbed bions or just dyons studied in the recent literature on brane physics [3-9]. thus

later on in the concluding remarks section, we shall comment on this point in detail.

ii. monopole elds in maxwell gauge theory

as stated, our main objective in this work is the parallel study of physics of magnetic

monopoles between in abelian bi electrodynamics and in the standard maxwell electro-

dynamics. thus to this end, we begin with the brief review of diracs proposal for the

introduction of magnetic monopoles in maxwell theory. consider the action for the maxwell

gauge theory in at spacetime (and in mks unit)

s = z d4x(cid:20)

1
4

ff  + ja(cid:21)

(1)

where f = a  a is the eld strength and j = (e, ji

e) is the electric source current

for the abelian eld a. extremizing this action with respect to the gauge eld a, then,

yields the eld equation for a as

f  = j.

(2)

in addition to this, there is a supplementary equation coming from an identity satised by

the abelian gauge eld strength tensor, f + f + f = 0. this is the bianchi

4

identity which is just a geometrical equation and in terms of the hodge dual eld strength,

f  = 1

2f, it can be written as

 f  = 0

(3)

and it seems noteworthy that the eld equation for a in eq.(2) is the dynamical eld

equation which gets determined by the concrete nature of the gauge theory action such as

the one in eq.(1). the bianchi identity in eq.(3), on the other hand, is simply a geometrical

identity and is completely independent of the choice of the context of the gauge theory.

this set of four equations, known as the maxwell equations for classical electrodynamics,

however, may be viewed as being somewhat incomplete in that the right hand side (r.h.s)

of the bianchi identity is vacant. thus dirac proposes to make it look complete by adding

the magnetic current density term k = (m, ji

m) on the r.h.s. further, if one decomposes

these covariant equations using  = (/t, i),  =  = (/t, i) (namely, we

use the sign convention,  = diag(1, 1, 1, 1)), a = (, ai) and the eld identication,

ei = fi0, bi = 1

2 ijkf jk or fij = ijkbk, the dynamical eld equation decomposes into

  ~e = e,   ~b 

 ~e
t

= ~je

while the geometrical bianchi identity decomposes as

  ~b = m,   ~e +

 ~b
t

= ~jm.

(4)

(5)

these maxwell equations are then invariant under the duality transformation (here in this

work, we restrict ourselves to the discrete duality transformation, not the continuous duality

rotations [4])

f   f ( ~e  ~b),

j  k

(6)

and

f   f ( ~b   ~e),

k  j.

note, however, that this dual invariance is just a symmetry in the classical eld equa-

tion and the bianchi identity but not in the maxwell theory action l =  1

4 ff  as

5

f f  = ff . lastly, before we end our review of magnetic monopoles in maxwell

gauge theory, we recall, for later use, that the expressions for the static electric and mag-

netic elds generated by electric and magnetic monopoles sitting at the origin and hence the

solutions to   ~e = e3(~r) and   ~b = g3(~r) are given respectively by ~e = (e/4r2)r and

~b = (g/4r2)r for r 6= 0. they have the same structure, i.e., the identical r-dependences as

can be expected from the dual symmetry of the maxwell equations. this point, which is so

familiar and hence looks trivial, will be contrasted to what happens in the study of static

monopole elds in abelian bi gauge theory to which we now turn.

iii. monopole and dyon elds in abelian bi gauge theory

as usual, we begin with the action for this abelian bi theory which is given, in 4-dimensions,

by [2]

s = z d4x(2"1 sdet( +
= z d4x(2"1 s1 +

where  is a generic parameter of the theory having the dimension dim[] = dim[f] =

+2. it probes the degree of deviation of bi gauge theory from the standard maxwell theory

and obviously    limit corresponds to the standard maxwell theory. again, extremzing

this action with respect to a yields the dynamical bi eld equation

(8)

the geometrical bianchi identity, which is a supplementary equation to this eld equation

is, as mentioned earlier, independent of the nature of the gauge theory action. thus it is

as before, we now split up these covariant equations and write them in terms of ~e and ~b

 f  = 0.

(11)

for the geometrical bianchi identity and where we used ff  = 2( ~e2 ~b2) and f f  =

4 ~e  ~b. we now consider the case when both the electric current density j = (e,~je) and

the magnetic current density k = (m,~jm) are present. then as before, the bianchi identity

gets modied to

  ~b = m,   ~e +

 ~b
t

= ~jm

(12)

or, in covariant form, to  f  = k. one can then readily realize that, unlike the maxwell

equations, these four bi equations evidently do not possess the duality invariance mentioned

earlier. namely, the two dynamical bi eld equations and the remaining two geometrical

bianchi identity are not dual to each other any more and it can be attributed to the fact

that when passing from the standard maxwell to this highly nonlinear bi theory, only

the dynamical eld equations experience non-trivial change (nonlinearization) and the

geometrical bianchi identity remains unchanged as it is independent of the nature of gauge

theory itself. this inherent lack of dual invariance in bi equations then may imply that we

need not introduce the point-like magnetic monopole and current in the rst place. but for

the sake of parallel study of the interesting monopole physics in maxwell theory, here we shall

assume the existence of point-like magnetic monopole and explore the physics of it such as

the structure of static monopole elds and the possible existence of the dyon solution. first,

we consider the static magnetic monopole eld and electric monopole eld in this abelian

bi gauge theory. the static magnetic monopole eld can be obtained by solving one of the

bianchi identity equations,   ~b = g3(~r). for ~r 6= 0, and in spherical-polar coordinates,

this equation is given by [r(r2 sin br) + (r sin b) + (rb)]/r2 sin  = 0 and is solved

by br(r) = g/4r2, b = b = 0. note that this solution form holds irrespective of

the existence of the electric monopole. next, the static electric monopole eld can be

7

obtained from one of the dynamical eld equations   [n ~e + ( ~e  ~b) ~b/2o /r] = e3(~r)
with r  n1  ( ~e2  ~b2)/2  ( ~e  ~b)2/4o1/2

coordinates, this equation becomes [r(r2 sin  er) + (r sin  e) + (r e)]/r2 sin  = 0

. again for ~r 6= 0, and in spherical-polar

with ei  [ei + ( ~e  ~b)bi/2]/r. firstly, in the absence of the magnetic monopole, ei =
ei/q1  ~e2/2 and then the above equation is solved by er(r) = e/4qr4 + (e/4)2,

e = e = 0. next, in the presence of the magnetic monopole, one has to put the magnetic

monopole eld ~b = (g/4r2)r in ei and r and then solve the equation. then the equation
admits the solution er(r) = e/4qr4 + (e2 + g2)/(4)2,e = e = 0. the static magnetic

monopole eld in the abelian bi theory, therefore, turns out to be identical to that in the

standard maxwell theory. concerning the static electric monopole eld in this abelian bi

theory, however, there are two peculiar features worthy of note. for one thing, unlike in the

maxwell theory, the electric monopole eld and the magnetic monopole eld exhibit dierent

r-dependences which can be attributed to the fact that in this bi theory, the dynamical eld

equation and the bianchi identity are not dual to each other. besides, since the static electric

monopole eld is not singular as r  0, the energy stored in the eld of electric point charge

could be nite and this point seems to be consistent with the consideration of niteness of

energy, which is one of the motivations to propose this bi electrodynamics when it was rst

devised. for the other, it is very interesting to note that the static electric monopole eld

gets modied when the magnetic monopole (eld) is present although the r-dependence

itself remains essentially the same as we observed above. this is indeed a very peculiar

feature which is unique and has no analogue in the standard maxwell theory. and when

the magnetic monopole (eld) is present, the strength of the static electric monopole eld

appears to experience some attenuation which is particularly noticeable in the small-r

region, when compared to the case without the magnetic monopole eld. it is also tempting

to interpret this unique coupling between the electric and magnetic eld even in the static

monopole case (which evidently originates from the highly nonlinear nature of bi theory

action in 4-dimensions) as the manifestation of the existence of dyon even in abelian

8

bi gauge theory. thus we elaborate on this particularly interesting point. first notice that

the evaluation of the det( + f/) in the general form of the bi action particularly in

4-dimensions produces the term (f f )2/164 = ( ~e  ~b)2/4, i.e.,

sdet( +

1


f) = s1 +

1
22 ff  

1
164 (f f )2.

and it is precisely this term which induces a unique and direct coupling between the electric

and magnetic eld even in the static monopole case and hence generates the dyon solution.

then next, we seem to be left with the question : what are the evidences that would support

the dyon interpretation of monopole solutions ?

~b =

g
4r2 r,

~e =

e

4rr4 + e2+g2

(4)2

r.

(13)

even in a loose sense, two pieces of evidences can be suggested. we begin with the

rst one. consider that in the standard maxwell theory, the monopole solutions ~b =

{g/4|~r  ~rb|3} (~r  ~rb) and ~e = {e/4|~r  ~re|3} (~r  ~re), corresponding to the congura-

tion in which the magnetic charge g is xed at ~r = ~rb and the electric charge is xed at ~r = ~re

separately, are simultaneous solutions to the maxwell equations. and the particular solu-

tions ~b = {g/4r2} r and ~e = {e/4r2} r just represent the case when the two monopoles

g and e happen to be sitting on the same location, the origin. in the bi theory of electro-

magnetism, however, the particular solutions given in eq.(13) above do not simply represent

the case when the two monopole, g and e are sitting separately at the origin. instead, these

particular static monopole solutions represent a single, point-like entity carrying both elec-

tric and magnetic charges, i.e., the point-like dyon. to see if this is indeed the case, notice

that ~b = {g/4|~r  ~rb|2} (r  rb) and ~e = ne/4q|~r  ~re|4 + [e2 + g2/(4)2]o (r  re)

(where (r  rb)  (~r  ~rb)/|~r  ~rb|) fail to be simultaneous solutions to the bi equa-

tions   ~b = g3(~r  ~rb) and   [n ~e + ( ~e  ~b) ~b/2o /r] = e3(~r  ~re) (where again
r  n1  ( ~e2  ~b2)/2  ( ~e  ~b)2/4o1/2

) for ~rb 6= ~re. they, however, can be simultane-

ous solutions only for ~rb = ~re, namely only when g and e stick to each other. and it is

straightforward to check that the static monopole solutions to bi equations for ~rb 6= ~re,

9

when actually worked out, turn out to take dierent structures from those given above by

simply replacing ~r  (~r  ~rb) and ~r  (~r  ~re). this is certainly in sharp contrast to

what happens in standard maxwell electromagnetism where ~b = {g/4|~r  ~rb|2} (r  rb)

and ~e = {e/4|~r  ~re|2} (r  re), which are obtained simply by replacing ~r  (~r  ~rb) and

~r  (~r ~re) are legitimate and unique solutions to the maxwell equations even for ~rb 6= ~re.

undoubtedly, this observation implies that in bi theory, when both electric and magnetic

charges are present, they can stick together to form a point-like dyon and the static electric

and magnetic elds it produces are given by the expressions given above with ~rb = ~re. thus

this can be thought of as one clear evidence in favor of the dyon interpretation and the other

can be derived in terms of energetics (argument in terms of energy) as follows. consider the

energy-momentum tensor of this bi theory

t = 2(1  r) +

1

r "ff 

 

 #

42 (ff )f f 

(14)

with r as given earlier. the energy density stored in the electromagnetic eld can then be

read o as

(15)

which does reduce to its maxwell theorys counterpart ( ~e2 + ~b2)/2 in the limit    as

it should. we now compute the energy density solely due to the magnetic eld generated

by the magnetic charge g. using ~b = (g/4r2)r,

there now seem to be two points worthy of note. one is the fact that t b

00 and t e

00 are

basically the same except that g and e are interchanged although the magnetic monopole

eld ~b and the electric monopole eld ~e possess dierent r-dependences. the other is, as

born and infeld hoped when they constructed this new theory, the energy stored in a static

monopole eld is indeed nite. for instance, the electric monopole energy can be evaluated

in a concrete manner as [4]

where y2 = (4/e2)r2 and in the y-integral, integration by part and the elliptic integral

have been used. coming back to the argument based on the energetics, lastly we compute

the energy density due to the electric and magnetic elds generated by both the electric

charge and the magnetic charge. substituting the expressions given in eq.(13) into eq.(15),

one gets

(19)

now note the following two points : concerning the dyon interpretation, we would like to

draw some hints by comparing t e+b

00

with t e

00 + t b

00. firstly, t e+b

00

turns out not to be

symmetric under e  g whereas t e

00 + t b

00 was as we noticed earlier. secondly, the sum of

energy density of magnetic monopole eld alone t b

00 and energy density of electric monopole

eld alone t e

00 is not equal to the energy density of electric and magnetic elds when both

the electric and magnetic monopoles are present, i.e., t e

00 + t b

00 6= t e+b

00

. again these

observations are in apparent contrast to what happens in standard maxwell theory where

t e
00 + t b

00 = 1

2( ~e2 + ~b2) = e2+g2

2(4)2 ( 1

r4 ) = t e+b

00

and hence the possibility of e  g bound state

or dyon is completely excluded even if they are forced to be brought together. here, when

11

considering the total energy of e  g system, one might wonder why the e  g interaction

potential energy is not taken into account. recall, however, that we are considering only

the static case when both e and g are held xed at each position and hence exert no force

to each other. to see this, note that the lorentz force law is generalized in the presence

of both electric and magnetic charges to (the validity of this lorentz force law even in the

context of bi electrodynamics will be discussed carefully later on)

m

or in components, to

d2x

d 2 = (cid:16)ef  + g f (cid:17) dx

d

~f = e( ~e + ~v  ~b) + g( ~b  ~v  ~e)

(20)

from which one can realize that, unlike the homogeneous systems of electric charges alone or

magnetic charges alone, the interaction force (and hence the potential energy) between e and

g arises only when one of the two is in motion relative to the other. therefore in the static

case, there is no interaction force and potential energy between static e and g and thus the

total energy density of e  g system is given simply by t e+b

00

. therefore this consideration

of energetics of e  g system also appears to provide another concrete evidence in favor of

the existence of a e  g bound state, i.e., a dyon in bi theory of electromagnetism although

the denite statement can be made if one could somehow show t e+b

00 which, at

00 < t e

00 + t b

least to us, does not look so easy to demonstrate in a straightforward manner. lastly, one

can realize that despite all these unique and interesting features, the static monopole elds

in non-trivial bi theory (i.e., for nite-) are eectively indistinguishable from those in

the standard maxwell theory in the far (r  ) zone and the possibly signicant deviations

occur only in the near (r  0) zone.

before we close the study of monopoles and dyons in abelian bi gauge theory, we would

like to make one more point which seems worthy of note. in the standard maxwell theory,

the motion of an electrically charged particle in a radial magnetic monopole eld is of some

interest. thus we now consider the motion of an electrically charged test particle in the

12

external background magnetic eld generated by a static magnetic monopole acting as

just a source. (thus this situation should be distinguished from the system of static electric

charge e and magnetic charge g we considered above when both e and g are xed at each

position and thus treated as sources for static monopole elds.) to be a little more specic,

it is well-known that in this system the conserved quantity is not just the orbital angular

momentum of the charged test particle, ~l, but the total angular momentum given by

~j = ~l 

eg
4

r

(21)

where ~jem = r d3x[~x  ( ~e  ~b)] = (eg/4)r is the angular momentum of the charged point

particles electric eld obeying   ~e = e3(~x  ~r) (with ~r being the trajectory of the electric

charge) and the static monopoles magnetic eld ~b = (g/4r2)x.

in quantized version

of the theory, then, one expects components of ~j to satisfy the usual angular momentum

commutation relations implying that the eigenvalues of ji are half integers. since the orbital

angular momentum ~l is expected to have integral eigenvalues, one then gets eg/4 = n/2

with n being integers. thus eq.(21), in turn, implies the dirac quantization condition

eg = 2n.

(22)

then one might wonder what would happen to the same test electric charge-source monopole

system particularly concerning the dirac quantization rule in the context of abelian bi

theory. the answer is, interestingly, that no essential changes occur. to see this, we rst

attempt to derive the expression for the conserved total angular momentum of this system.

to do so, however, one needs to know the bi theory version of lorentz force law. as we

mentioned earlier, indeed the lorentz force law is determined in a gauge theory-independent

manner. this can be readily checked as follows. we begin with the 4-vector current of a

charged particle localized on its spacetime trajectory x( ) with  being particles proper

time

j(t, ~y) = e

dx
dt

3[~y  ~x( )]|t=x0( ) = ez d

dx
d

4[y  x( )]

13

which fullls the continuity equation j = 0. now to see what the lorentz force law

would look like in the context of bi electrodynamics, we consider the combined system of a

charged test particle and a given background gauge eld in abelian bi theory described by

the action

s = z d4x [lbi + ja]  mz ds
= z d4xlbi + ez dxa[x( )]  mz ds
= z d4xlbi +z dt(cid:20)mq1  v2

i  ea0 + eaivi(cid:21)

(23)

where lbi is the abelian bi theory action given earlier and we used ds = d = dtq1  v2

apparently, any charged particle acts as an additional source thus modifying the surrounding

i .

eld. if, however, we neglect this back reaction eect as a rst approximation and assume

a as just a external background eld, we may leave out the gauge eld action as the external

eld serves as just a hard background. thus in this usual approximation in which the back

reaction of the charged test particle to the surrounding eld is neglected, the motion of the

charged particle becomes independent of the detailed dynamical nature of the gauge theory

itself. therefore the motion of a charged particle under the inuence of a given external

gauge eld would be governed by the action

s = z dt(cid:20)mq1  v2

i + e(aivi  a0)(cid:21)

and by extremizing it with respect to xi, one gets the following euler-lagranges equation

of motion d ~p /dt = e( ~e + ~v  ~b) where p i = mvi/q1  v2

i . since this is the usual lorentz

force law, we can realize that indeed it holds irrespective of the context of the dynamical

gauge theory as stated above. thus even in this abelian bi gauge theory, the rate of change

of the orbital angular momentum of the system consisting of the electrically charged test

particle and the source magnetic monopole is

d~l
dt

= ~r 

d ~p
dt

=

eg
4r3 ~r  ( ~r  ~r) =

d

dt (cid:18) eg

4

r(cid:19)

again suggesting that the conserved total angular momentum is given by ~j = ~l  (eg/4)r

just as in the standard maxwell theory. and this result implies that the usual dirac quanti-

14

zation condition still holds true in abelian bi theory as well. in addition, we also realized in

this work that in this bi theory, point-like dyons as well as magnetic monopoles can exist.

and it is not hard to see that even in the combined system of an electrically charged test

particle and a static source dyon, the conserved total angular momentum is the same as in

the test particle-monopole system and hence the dirac quantization condition also remains

the same. next, it seems worthy of note that the interpretation of this total angular mo-

mentum as the sum of orbital angular momentum ~l of the test electric charge e and the eld

angular momentum ~jem = (eg/4)r due to the electric charge e and the magnetic charge

g also stays the same as in the maxwell theory case. namely, the angular momentum is

passed back and forth between the electric charge and the eld as it is expected to be. this

statement sounds natural and hence can be taken for granted. but to demonstrate that this

is indeed the case even in the context of bi theory is not so trivial and hence seems worth

doing. thus in the following, we briey sketch the demonstration. and to do so, we need

some preparation. in the dynamical bi eld equations given earlier, we dene, for the sake

of convenience of the formulation, the electric displacement ~d and the magnetic eld

~h in terms of the fundamental elds ~e and ~b as

~d =

1

r ( ~e +

1

2 ( ~e  ~b) ~b) ,

~h =

r ( ~b 

1

2 ( ~e  ~b) ~e)

where r = r1  1

2 ( ~e2  ~b2)  1

4 ( ~e  ~b)2 is as dened earlier. then the bi equations take

the form

  ~d = e,   ~h 

  ~b = m,   ~e +

 ~d

 ~b

= ~je

= ~jm.

(24)

now ~e  (amperes law eq.)  ~h  (faradays induction law eq.) yields

~h  (  ~e)  ~e  (  ~h) =  ~h

further using

 ~b

=

t00

where t00 is the energy density stored in the electromagnetic eld in bi theory given in

eq.(15), one arrives at the familiar local energy conservation equation

  ~s +

u
t

= ~je  ~e  ~jm  ~h

(25)

where u = t00 is the energy density, ~s = ~e  ~h is the poynting vector representing the

local energy ow per unit time per unit area and ~je  ~e  ~jm  ~h on the right hand side is

the power dissipation per unit volume. in particular for ~je  ~e = 0 = ~jm  ~h, one gets

  ~s +

u
t

= 0

which is precisely the equation of continuity for electromagnetic energy density. now having

derived the bi theory version of the poynting vector as ~s = ~e  ~h = ~e  ( ~b/r), the

angular momentum of the electromagnetic eld is obtained by integrating the moment of

the poynting vector over all space which yields

~jem = z d3x(cid:20)~x  ( ~e

(26)

where we used ~b = (g/4r2)x and  ~d = e3(~x~r) representing the conguration in which

the static source magnetic monopole is sitting at the origin while the test electric charge, at

some point of time, is at ~r. thus this completes the demonstration.

iv. concluding remarks

to summarise, it is interesting to note that in the context of bi electrodynamics, despite the

inherent lack of dual symmetry in bi equations, when we assume the existence of magnetic

monopoles, interesting new physics emerge such as the exotic behavior of static electric

monopole eld and the existence of point-like dyons while the cherished principles such as

the dirac quantisation condition still hold true without experiencing any modication.

16

concerning the nature of the present work, a word of caution may be helpful to answer to

possible criticism. that is, one might wonder what exactly distinguishes the present work

from the pile of works on similar subjects in the recent literature [3-9]. as we mentioned

at the beginning of the introduction, the revival of interest in the bi gauge theory was

triggered by the recently fashionable d-brane physics [2]. indeed in the recent literature,

one nds a number of works discussing dyons in abelian bi gauge theory [5-9]. some of

them use the terminology, bions for soliton solutions possessing the properties of these

dyons. although these dyon solutions are also static solutions in abelian bi gauge theory,

they all arise in theories resulted from the dimensional reduction of some higher-dimensional

(10-dimensional, to be more specic) supersymmetric pure abelian bi theory. being theories

which emerge as a result of dimensional reduction, they inevitably involve one or more scalar

elds degrees of freedom representing the compactied extra dimensions in addition to the

4-dimensional abelian bi gauge eld. and it is precisely these additional scalar elds which

play the role of higgs-type eld in the familiar yang-mills-higgs theory [10] and thus lead

to bogomolnyi-type rst-order equations [11] of which the solitonic solutions are generally

dyon solutions. thus the dyon solutions in these brane-inspired theories are really julia-

zee-type dyon solutions [12] in nature and the abelian bi gauge eld involved behaves as

the abelian projection of the non-abelian yang-mills eld after the spontaneous symmetry

breaking. and the dyon solutions there rely, for their existence, entirely on the non-vanishing

scalar elds having some particular solution behavior. in addition, the electric charge and

the magnetic charge there are not two independent parameters. instead, they are generated

from a single parameter of the theory. besides, it seems worth mentioning that even some

early works [3,4] (but in modern perspective) on 4-dimensional nonlinear electrodynamics,

such as that of bi, never considered the physics in the presence of magnetic monopoles

and discussed only the exotic behavior of static electric monopole eld.

in contrast, our

philosophy in the present work was the parallel comparison of monopole physics between in

standard maxwell electrodynamics and in the original version of abelian bi electrodynamics

having no connection whatsoever to the brane physics. thus the relevant degree of freedom

17

of the theory is just the abelian gauge eld alone and then we discovered static solutions

possessing all the evidences in favor of the dyon interpretation. moreover, this point-like

dyon solution carries electric and magnetic charges which are independent of each other

up to dirac quantisation condition. to conclude, therefore, point-like dyon solution in the

original version of the 4-dimensional bi electrodynamics found in the present work should

be distinguished from the ones with the same name appeared in the recent literature. and

as we stressed in the text, this occurrence of point-like dyon solution in bi electrodynamics

can be attributed to the highly nonlinear nature of the theory, or more precisely, to the

unique and direct coupling between electric and magnetic elds appearing particularly in

4-dimensions even in the static case. lastly, in the present work we witnessed that even the

simple study of monopole physics exposed some of the unique and exciting hidden features

of the abelian bi gauge theory and this seems to suggest that the bi gauge theories, abelian

or non-abelian, really deserve serious and full exploration in modern eld theory perspective.
