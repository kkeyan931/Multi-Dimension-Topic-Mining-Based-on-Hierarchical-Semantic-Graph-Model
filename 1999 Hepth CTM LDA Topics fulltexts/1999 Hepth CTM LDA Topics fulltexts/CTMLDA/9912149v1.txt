calculation of the 4 6-loop non-zeta transcendental

oliver schnetz 

december 16, 1999

abstract

we present an analytic calculation of the rst transcendental in 4-theory that is not of
the form (2n+1). it is encountered at 6 loops and known to be a weight 8 double sum. here
it is obtained by reducing multiple zeta values of depth  4. we give a closed expression in
terms of a zeta-related sum for a family of diagrams that entails a class of physical graphs.
we conrm that this class produces multiple zeta values of weights equal to the crossing
numbers of the related knots.

the miraculous connection between feynman graphs, knots, and numbers discovered by d.
kreimer and d.j. broadhurst [1][5] reveals a structure underlying generic renormalizable quan-
tum field theories. it is conjectured that via knot theory the topology of an amplitude pro-
vides its transcendental number contents which for primitively divergent diagrams, is given by
the renormalization scheme independent numerical factor in front of the logarithmic singularity.
the calculation of these numbers was acchieved in [1] for 56 of the 59 primitively divergent
graphs up to 7 loops in massless 4-theory. diagrams that could not be calculated analytically
were evaluated numerically to high precision. a systematic search for the rational coecients
of a conjectured basis of transcendentals led in all but three 7-loop diagrams (related to the
hyperbolic knots 10139 and 10152) to (with very high probability) exact results.

the rst graphs where analytic calculations were not available showed up at 6 loops. these
diagrams entailed the 4,3-torus knot (as opposed to the (2n+1),2-torus knots leading to (2n+1))
which was determined to be related to the transcendental 1

pk>1 knm. in the terminology of [1] these graphs are the m (2, 1, 1, 0) and the m (1, 1, 1, 1)

in this paper we focus on the more symmetric m (1, 1, 1, 1). we keep equations general as
far as this does not complicate calculations. in theorem 10 a closed result is given that easily
generalizes to encorporate all n-banana diagrams (dened below). the derivation is organized
as a collection of propositions that are all proved in full detail although most of them are
elementary.

in order to handle the general case most eciently, it is convenient to use a -symbol (also

f0 (x, y) =

fk+1 (x, y) = z dz

(x  z)2

z2 fk (z, y)

remark 2. the funcion fk(x, y) depends only on |x|, |y|, and the angle between x and y. we
may treat it as a function of two complex variables xc and yc that coincide with x and y if the
complex plane is considered as the subspace of r4 spanned by x and y.

instead of fk(xc, 1c) we also write fk(x, x). we have

fk (x, y) = fk (y, x) ,

fk (xc, yc) =

1
|yc|2 f (xc/yc, 1c) =

1
|xc|2 f (yc/xc, 1c) .

denition 3 (n-banana). let k = (k1, . . ., kn) be a vector of non-negative integers with not
more than one of the ki = 0. let 2 <  < n  2 and e1 be a 4-dimensional unit-vector. then

b (k) = z dx(cid:16)x2(cid:17)

n

yi=1

fki (x, e1) .

(6)

note, that the integral is independent of e1 and converges under the above conditions.

in the notation of [1] we have

g (k1, k2, k3) = b0 (k1, k2, k3) = b1 (k1, k2, k3) and m (k1, k2, k3, k4) = b0 (k1, k2, k3, k4) .

we restrict ourselves to 1 <  < n  3 and ki  1 i which includes b0(1, 1, 1, 1).

we nd the following behaviour of fk(xx, x/x) as a function of a complex variable x.

proposition 7. the function fk(xx, x/x) is analytic in x save for two cuts on the real axis
ranging from 0 to x< and from 1/x< to . moreover, if x = |x|ei we have in the limit   0

(in the limit   0 the poles in the dierences move to the points t = x|x| and t = x/|x| on the

4 conclusions

we presented a closed expression for n-banana diagrams in terms of sums that easily convert to
multiple zeta values.

the derivation is valid for 1 <  < n3 whereas the n-banana is dened for 2 <  < n2.
if we approach the limit  = 1 or  = n  3 in eq. (21) we encounter terms of the form 1/0k
for k > 0. the limit, however, is nite. we conclude that the coecients in front of the singular
terms add up to zero. we thus expect eq. (21) to be valid in the region 2 <  < n  2 if one
nullies singular terms.

the inclusion of the case ki = 0 for one i  {0, . . ., n} is straight forward and amouts to
basically replacing the numerators i + i by linear combinations of the njs. it is hence possible
to treat all n-banana diagrams with our method. analogous results may be derived in any even
dimensions.

equation (21) can be used to study the cases where level-mixing does not occur. if n  5

we expect in general level-mixing due to the inhomogeneous factor of (cid:0)n+n4
n3 (cid:1).

from eq. (21) we read o that for ki  1 the 4-banana in homogeneous of weight 2(k1 + k2 +
k3 + k4). we expect the same behaviour if one of the kis is zero. this conrms the conjecture
in [2] that the class b0(k, l, 1, 1) of graphs related to renormalizable quantum field theories
reduces to multiple zeta values of weight equal to the crossing number of the related knots.

the cases where  = 1,  = n  2, or n = 3 are more subtle because of the occurence of
the singular terms. these cases include a second physical series b0(m + n + 2, k, 0) which is
conjectured to lead to weight 2(n + m + k) + 5 multiple zeta transcendentals. these together
with two more classes of non-banana diagrams are expected to exhaust all independent multiple
zeta values up to weight 16 (corresponding to 9 loops).

we would not be surprised if future work reveals a simpler derivation of b0(1, 1, 1, 1) since
b0(1, 1, 1, 1) seems genuinly to be a two-fold sum: the coecients in front of the (3)2(2)-
transcendental add up to zero. since the reduction of weight 8 depth 2 multiple zeta values (in
contrast to depth > 2) never produces (3)2(2)-terms the miracle of the vanishing coecient
could be naturally avoided if there was a calculation of b0(1, 1, 1, 1) that does not make use of
depth > 2. moreover our calculation does not explain the connection to the (4,3)-torus-knot
(and the t5,2t3,2-factor knot).

we close the paper with the conjecture that any amplitude reduces to multiple zeta values
if it has an angular graph that reduces to a single line () after repeated substitutions of
double lines (==) and iterated lines () by single lines. those amplitudes are free of
6- or higher-j-symbols. they do not entail the full structure of 4 dimensions and are therefore
accessible to reducing 4-dimensional integrals to integrals over the complex plane which lies in
the heart of our calculations.
