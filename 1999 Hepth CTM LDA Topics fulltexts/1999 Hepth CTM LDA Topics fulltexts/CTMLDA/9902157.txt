(the written version marginally better.) one standard exercise proposed rederive results, xing signs factors process. hopefully substance survived sloppyness. so, right task. 2 2 permutation group approach way introduction covering standard ground, study context statistics initially arose, namely permutation group quantum mechanics -. main emphasis connecting path integral pointing possibilities generalizations within approach. main themes lecture are: a) eliminating gauge multiplicity states originating particle permuta- tions. will, general, lead appearance internal degrees freedom residue identities (distinguishability) particles. b) implementing path integral identical particles. indistinguishability calls including paths lead permutation nal position. deter- mining right weights sectors (which necessarily phases) x statistics. 2.1 realization reduced hilbert space work rst-quantized picture, number particles xed particles nevertheless taken indistinguishable. contrasted weaker statement particles merely identical. x ideas, let us call {xi} coordinates particles, = 1 . . . n enumerating particles, assume, now, internal degrees freedom. xi space dimension. hilbert space system spanned position eigenstates |x1, . . . xn > |x >. let us also dene operators p sn permute quantum numbers particles. n! operators forming permutation (or symmetric) group n objects sn . collection states set distinct xi transforms n!-dimensional regular (dening) representation sn p|x > |p x >= |xp (1), . . . xp (n ) > (1) notice coordinates xi coincide full dening representation more. set states, however, measure zero (the coordinate space assumed continuous) thus safely ignored. (we assume interactions singular coincidence points might dynamically make states nonzero weight.) particles identical hamiltonian treats equally thus  = 0 (2) p . however, particles also indistinguishable, means physical way ever able tell particles other. thus, hamiltonian, conceivable perturbations hamiltonian must commute permutation operators. (these perturbations would correspond 3 various devices, dies tricks would attach system eort tell particles other.) short, permutation operators must commute physical observables a:  = 0 (3) operator p commutes (physical) operators system superselection rule: possible transition interference states corresponding dierent eigenvalues operator thus choose subspace xed eigenvalue stay ever. (this also called picking theta-vacuum particle gauge theories.) case, whole set operators commuting everything else (the group sn ) thus generalized theta-vacuum states consist irreducible representations (irreps) sn . further, states connected action operators p cannot distinguished physical operator therefore must identied unique physical state. words, permutation group must viewed discrete gauge group producing unphysical transformations, is, copies physical system. must, therefore: project subspace corresponding particular irrep r sn identify elements within subspace grouping irrep unique physical state. procedure choice r corresponds choice statistics. implement coordinate representation |x1, . . . xn > |x >. projecting hilbert space irrep r sn amounts keeping linear combinations states within multiplet transform r, is, |a; x >= xp ca(p )p|x > , = 1, . . . dr , dr = dim(r). (4) sum elements permutation group ca(p ) appro- priately chosen coecients. denote rab(p ) matrix elements permutation p representations r, p|a, x >= xb rab(p 1)|b, x > (5) (the appearance p 1 necessary successive transformations com- bine right order.) dening representation decomposes irreducible components, classied young tableaux, appearing certain multiplicity. keep one irrep multiplicity whole multiplet? decide it, note instead base state |x > construction states |a, x > choose dierent permutation po|x >, although new states |a, pox > constructed (5) still transform irrep r, general linear combinations |a, x > rather span dierent copy r. since continuously move 4 conguration space |x > po|x >, conclude must keep irreps r within multiplet. (in words, although point hilbert space |x > multiplet reducible, ber representations hilbert space connected irreducible.) realize explicitly above, construct states |ab, x >= dr n! xp rab(p )p|x > (6) using group property representation r(p1)r(p2) = r(p1p2), deduce action group sn change base point x states transform as: p|ab, x >= xc rac(p 1)|cb, x > , |ab, p x >= xc rcb(p 1)|ac, x > (7) thus see rst index states labels dierent elements single irrep r, second index labels dierent equivalent irreps multiplet. since indices take dr values, recover standard result irrep sn embedded dening representation number times equal dimension. consider matrix element < ab, x|a|cd, >, physical operator, is, operator commuting elements p sn . substituting denition (6) using unitarity p (p = p 1) r (r ab(p ) = rba(p 1)) obtain, change summation variable, < ab, x|a|cd, >= dr n! xp,p ,e rbe(p )rea(p 1)rcd(p ) < x|ap |y > (8) using orthogonality (shurs) relation (see, e.g., ) rab(p )rcd(p 1) = n! dr adbc xp nally obtain < ab, x|a|cd, >= xp acrbd(p ) < x|a|p > (9) (10) clear (10) possible transition states dierent rst index. further, states index, amplitude independent index. thus, rst index state |ab, x > propagates trivially. since index corresponds dierent physically equivalent states within irrep r, conclude required projection hilbert space physical subspace amounts simply omitting index states. (that is, freeze index xed value states theory; 5 physical quantity ever depend choice value.) hand, second index, corresponding dierent equivalent irreps, propagate trivially must, argued before, kept. led therefore physical states |ba, x > |a, x >. let us rst choose = 1. (10) provides overlap states < ab, x|cd, >= xp acrbd(p )(x p y) (11) x neighborhood p = 1 contributes normalization, rbd(1) = bd recover standard continuous normalization states. choose, now, = eiht, h hamiltonian, thus nd propa- gator g(ab, x; cd, y|t) states system. projecting physical states |ba, x > |a, x > obtain propagator gr(a, x; b, y|t) = xp rab(p ) g(x, p y; t) (12) g(x, p y; t) = < x|eihtp|y > usual many-body propagator. note that, due transformation property (7), states |a, p x > linear combinations states |a, x >. therefore, projecting physical subspace corresponding r amounts trading original n! copies physically equivalent states |p x > number dr global internal degrees freedom system, labeled index a. 2.2 path integral generalized statistics easy write path integral corresponding identical particles quantized r-irrep sn . g(x, p y; t) expressed n-body path integral standard way, particles starting positions xi ending positions p yi = yp (i). since permutations particle positions physically equivalent, (12) instructs us sum sectors particles end permuted positions, weighted factors rab(p ) depending internal degrees freedom initial nal states.

(this, then, would augment space physical operators theory.) general situation include cr states irrep r. statistics xed set non-negative integers cr. generalization results general situation straightforward. internal degree freedom takes values = (r, a, ), = 1, . . . dr labels inequivalent r-irreps = 1, . . . cr labels states kept within irrep. (a, ) constitute internal degrees freedom within irrep. so, overall, takes pr crdr dierent values. propagator (and corresponding path integral) obviously gs(a, x; b, y|t) = xp s(p )ab g(x, p y; t) s(p )ab = ra,rb (ra)ab(p ) (15) (16) denition parabosons (parafermions) order p include irreps p rows (columns) young tableaux. have, therefore, cr = 1 irreps cr = 0 rest. note irreps parafermions duals parabosons (the dual tableau tableau rows columns interchanged). appropriate basis, repre- sentation matrices dual irreps r, r real satisfy rab(p ) = (1)p rab(p ) (17) (1)p parity permutation. arrive relation weights parabosons parafermions order p: spf (p )ab = (1)p spb(p )ab (18) extends similar relation ordinary fermions bosons , internal degrees freedom sb(p ) = 1. path integral evaluate partition function, simply shifting euclidean periodic propagator ge() = eh summing initial nal states, measure implied (13). given get expression terms characters sn raa(p ) = trr(p ) = r(p ) xa zs(t ) = z dn x n! xp s(p ) < x|ge()|p x > 7 (19) (20) also note inversion formula s(p ) = xr cr r(p ) cr = 1 n! xp s(p )r(p ) (21) (22) allows recover cr know s(p ) permutations. interpretation terms periodic euclidean path integral obvious. characters r(p ) set integers, thus statistical factors s(p ) weighing topological sector path integral (positive negative) integers. case para- bosons order p, however, note statistical weights positive (or zero) integers. ones parafermions either positive negative, given spf (p ) = (1)p spb(p ) , spb(p ) 0 (23) general formula spb(p ) arbitrary p. non-interacting particles partition function expressed terms characters su(n) (shurs functions) . note case distinguishable particles (innite statistics ), also included formalism, accepting states irrep, is, cr = dr. since r appears exactly dr times dening representation sn , s(p ) becomes trace p dening representation. p 6= 1 o-diagonal dening representation, get sinf (p ) = n! p,1, recovering z(t ) = z dn x < x|ge()|x > (24) distinguishable particles. 2.3 cluster decomposition factorizability parastatistics particle obey cluster decomposition principle, sense density matrix obtained tracing subset particles decouple system constructed possible density matrix reduced system remaining particles . (21), however, see partition function two dynamically isolated sets particles n1 n2 factorize product two partition functions, since statistical weights s(p ) general factorize s(p1)s(p2) p product two commuting elements p1 p2. equivalently, means occupation degeneracy d(p1, p2, . . .) p1, p2, . . . particles occupying set levels 1, 2, . . . factorize product individual occupation degeneracies level i. eective coupling particles. important physical implications. two sets particles totally isolated, make sense evaluate partition function total system, since statistical distribution never 8 relax one predicted partition function. individual partition functions subsystems relevant ones. if, however, two sets weakly coupled, initially set distribute according reduced partition function, relaxation time (depending strength coupling two sets) relax joint distribution function, which, stress, even approximately equal product individual ones. thus, cluster decomposition holds absolute sense fails realistic sense. contrast, fermions bosons respect cluster decomposition senses. summarize pointing general statistics type ex- amined parametrized three possible sets numbers. rst is, stated, number states cr accepted irrep r sn . second statistical weights s(p ) appearing partition function (euclidean path integral). weights invariant conjugation p qp q1. finally, could use degeneracy many-body occupancy state, call d, denition. (this starting point rst known attempt generalized statistics, gentile statistics. ) three sets contain many elements partitions n equivalent. restrictions criteria imposed parameters? rst one unitarity, is, existence well-dened hilbert space positive metric. requires cr non-negative (no negative norm states) integers (no fractional dimension states). call strong cluster decomposition principle factorizability, partition function isolated systems factorizes. physical criterion, rather consistency requirement. summarize: unitarity: cr non-negative integers factorizability: s(p ) = qncycles(p ) s(n) d = qi d(pi) factorizability, particular, implies grand partition function case noninteracting particles obtained exponentiating sum connected path integrals (p cyclic permutation degree n) weights s(n)/n (1/n symmetry factor path integral, corresponding cyclic relabelings particles). grand partition function factorize product partition functions level i. thus, s(n) cluster coecients connected d(n) standard way xp=0 d(p)zp = exp xn=1 s(n) n zn! (25) formula, fact, provides easiest way relate d s(p ) general case (no strong cluster property) enter this. assume s(1) = d(1) = 1, easy verify solution two criteria ordinary fermions bosons. situation dierent, however, s(1) = d(1) = q > 1 (this would mean, e.g., particles come priori q dierent avors). possibilities manifold. generalized 9 statistics share following generic features: (indeed, d(1, 1, . . . 1) = d(1)n = qn.) degeneracy state n particles occupy dierent levels qn. state obtained state b lumping together particles previously occupied dierent levels, d(a) d(b). (e.g., d(3) d(2, 1) d(1, 1, 1).) possibilities include obvious special cases q1 bosonic avors q2 fermionic ones (q1 + q2 = q), s(n) = q1 (1)nq2, along many other. example, give rst degeneracies many-particle level occupation statistics q = 2: d(1) = 2, d(2) = 4, d(3) = 8 d(1) = 2, d(2) = 3, d(3) = 6, 5, 4(b + b) d(1) = 2, d(2) = 2, d(3) = 4, 3, 2(b + f ), 1, 0 d(1) = 2, d(2) = 1, d(3) = 2, 1, 0(f + f ) d(1) = 2, d(2) = 0, d(3) = 0 specic choices denoted b + b, b + f f + f ones corre- sponding two bosonic, one bosonic one fermionic, two fermionic avors respectively. topmost statistics could termed superbosons bottom one superfermions order 2. also remark (p, q)-statistics introduced  realized particles p bosonic q fermionic avors, identify multiplet transforming irreducibly supergroup su(p, q) unique physical state. finally, comment gentile statistics . rule simply p particles put single-particle level. corresponds d(n) = 1 n p, d(n) = 0 otherwise. criticized  grounds x- ing allowed occupations single-particle state statement invariant change single-particle basis. clear lecture statistics satisfying unitarity requirement consistent basis-independent. therefore, gentile statistics must violate unitarity. indeed, easy check weights cr statistics integers (this generic statistics integer d(n)), necessarily positive. specic case p = 2, e.g., double occupancy level allowed, degeneracies irrep sn (parametrized, usual, length young tableau rows) n = 5 c2 = c21 = c22 = c221 = 1, c111 = c1111 = c2111 = 1, else cr = 0 (26) see representations 111, 1111, 2111 correspond ghost (negative norm) states eect subtract (rather add) degrees freedom. conclusion, see permutation group approach generalizing statis- tics gives results rather limited interest. resulting statistics though particles internal degrees freedom, perhaps superselection rule forbids manifestation possible internal states. nd something exotic must consider approaches. 10 3 one-dimensional systems: calogero model let us specialize one dimension see dierent angle approach problem statistics. peculiarity lineal world that, kine- matically, particles cannot exchange positions without bumping onto other. tangible physical consequences makes notion statistics one dimension rather special. lets see: a. since congurations related particle permutation gauge copies other, could gauge x restrict one gauge copy. one dimension conguration space n indistinguishable particles breaks n!
