black hole entropy from poisson brackets

(demystication of some calculations)

abstract

recently it has been suggested by s. carlip that black hole entropy
can be derived from a central charge of the virasoro algebra arising as
a subalgebra in the surface deformations of general relativity in any
dimension. here it is shown that the argumentation given in section
2 of hep-th/9812013 and based on the regge-teitelboim approach is
unsatisfactory. the functionals used are really non-dierentiable
under required variations and also the standard poisson brackets for
these functionals are exactly zero so being unable to get any virasoro
algebra with a central charge. nevertheless carlips calculations will
be correct if we admit another denition for the poisson bracket. this
new poisson bracket diers from the standard one in surface terms
only and allows to work with non-dierentiable functionals.

1 introduction

an important for black hole physics result  the entropy formula  was
derived in publication [1]. the similar conclusions were obtained also in some
other papers, see, for example, [2]. the characteristic feature of the method
applied in [1] is that the canonical formalism of general relativity and the
algebra of the hypersurface deformations are used. the virasoro algebra
with its central term arises as a result of the evaluation of poisson brackets
and taking into account boundary conditions on the black hole horizon.

in [1] it is declared that the regge-teitelboim approach based on a con-
struction of the so-called dierentiable generators is used there. however,
a detailed examination shows that this approach is really inaplicable to the
case under consideration. the generators of paper [1] actually are not dif-
ferentiable concerning variations needed to derive the virasoro albebra. in
fact, the straightforward and explicit calculation of the poisson brackets ac-
cording to the standard formula (by exploiting the general derivation of the
surface terms made for 3+1space-time still in 1985) gives us a trivial zero
result for the surface integral which should represent the main outcome of
paper [1].

we will demonstrate below that in fact modied poisson brackets, appli-
cable in the more general case of non-dierentiable functionals, are used in
publication [1] (but without authors knowledge). these new brackets dier
from the standard ones in boundary terms and they have been used for the
rst time in paper [5]. later they were generalized in two dierent ways [6],
[7]. the dierence between these two approaches does not manifest itself in
the case under consideration. recently the same brackets were independently
used also in publication [8].

therefore we observe that the derivation of the black hole entropy given
in paper [1] formally stays valid if one changes the argumentation.
it is
necessary to decline the regge-teitelboim ideology here in favor of the more
general approach which exploits the new poisson brackets.

2 notations and carlips calculation

we shall use the same notations as used in publication [1]. so, the metric of
n-dimensional (in further n = 4 case is preferred) space-time will be guessed

2

looking as follows

ds2 = n 2dt2 + f 2(dr + n rdt)2 + (dx + n dt)(dx + n dt),

where ,  . . . correspond to coordinates on a sphere r = const, t = const
and run over values 1, 2, . . . , n  2. the function n tends to zero on the
horizon of a black hole r = r+ in such a way that

n 2 = h(x)(r  r+) + o(r  r+)2.

(1)

further, the hamiltonian looks like a linear combination of constraints

{ht,ha} plus, probably, some surface integrals

h[] = z

dn1x h,

l[] = h[] +i

. . . ,

(2)

where the parameters of deformations of a constant time hypersurface (la-
grange multipliers for constraints) are components of the decomposition for
an innitesimal space-time dieomorphism  over the basis {(1/n,n a/n), /xa}:

t = nt,

a = a + n at.

(3)

if one calculate a variation over gab and ab of that part of a hamiltonian
containing only constraints (without the boundary terms), and consider 
as not depending of canonical variables, one get

(4)

where na is a unit normal to the boundary at t = const, kab is an extrinsic

curvature tensor of a constant time hypersurface, ab = f(k ab  gabk)

are momenta conjugate to the spatial metric gab (the sign diers from [1]).
the surface integral is taken over a boundary which should include, on the
one hand, the horizon of a black hole, and on another  the spatial innity.
no boundary conditions are applied here. to within notations the formula
coincides with the similar formula from publication by regge and teitelboim
[3].

in further the game is entered by boundary conditions on the canonical

variables and on the parameters of deformations. they are

3

1. to set in a phase space a region close to a black hole solution;

2. to provide conservation of this region under evolution assigned to the

parameters of deformations.

carlip starts with the following boundary conditions:

h
4

f =

n 1 + o(1),
(t  n rr)g = o(n)g,

n r = o(n 2),
n + n = o(n),

 = o(1),

kr = o(1/n),

krr = o(1/n 3),

r = o(n 2),

t = o(n),

n  = o(1),

rn = o(1/n),
k = o(1),
 = o(1).

what about a part of the boundary arranged at spatial innity, by con-
sidering parameters  as rapidly decreasing we get rid of the corresponding
contribution to the hamiltonian variation.

despite of the accepted boundary conditions the variation of hamiltonian
h[] still contains some surface contribution and to get rid of it in publication
[1] it is oered to add to a linear combination of constraints a surface integral
of the following form

j[] =

1

8g ir=r+

dn2xnnaa t + aa

r +hna akio.

(5)

the last term here is not required in further, as the extra restrictions krr =
0 = k are imposed on the exterior curvature tensor in [1]. it means that
the last term in formula (4) is zero already and we in fact need not the term
written in square brackets of (5). after that the variation of the improved
hamiltonian l[] = h[] + j[] becomes

l[] = bulk terms+

1

8g ir=r+

dn2x (cid:18)nrr t +(cid:20) 1

f

rkrr + nr rk(cid:21)(cid:19).

(6)

the last two terms in further are not necessary as mentioned above.

then in publication [1] it is stated that, rst, we can calculate a poisson
bracket for generators of two various deformations according to the following
formula

nl[2], l[1]o =  2l[1],

(7)

4

and secondly, it is supposed, that this equality remain valid after reduction,
that is, after taking constraints as zeros in strong sense. the last means,
that the formula remains valid for surface integrals taken separately:

boundary terms of nl[2], l[1]o  boundary terms of  2h[1] +  2j[1].

(8)
as a result of such evaluation the following expression was obtained for the

(9)
in further it is used to realize the virasoro algebra, which central charge
has allowed to connect the number of horizon states with the well-known
expression for the black hole entropy by bekenstein-hawking. below we
shall show, that the argumentation of paper [1] on a deduction of this formula
should be reconsidered.

3 the regge-teitelboim approach

in publication by regge and teitelboim [3], written in 1974, the hamilto-
nian formalism of a eld theory for the rst time was applied to a prob-
lem, where the surface integrals originating in integration by parts were non-
negligible, just opposite, they have an important physical meaning. namely,
after putting on gauges, that is, after reduction, the role of generators of the
asymptotic poincare group (transformations that preserve boundary condi-
tions of the asymptotically at space - time) is played by the surface integrals.
these surface integrals arise as a result of the poisson brackets evaluation
made according to the well-known formula

. . .}old = z

. . . , g +i

dn1x(cid:18) f

qa(x)(cid:19) ,
{f +i
and any modication of functionals f and g by surface integrals h . . . (or,

that is the same, a modication of their integrands by divergences) leaves
this bracket untouched. it is obvious, as the standard bracket is dened with
the help of euler-lagrange derivatives, and they are zero at any divergences.

it is a common belief that the essence of regge-teitelboims method is to x
surface terms in functionals in such a way that their variations look like

f = z

without any boundary terms.

however, in the regge-teitelboim approach we can start also with the
evaluation of surface integrals in poisson brackets. this possibility was used
in our publication [4]. thus taking as initial hamiltonians

h[] = z

dn1x h

(10)

where {ht,ha} are constraints, we obtain (we write below the corresponding
formula from publication [4] in the notations of carlips work (here n = 4))
the following expression for their poisson bracket:

now in the above we can take into account the boundary conditions from
paper [1]. then we get, for example,

(14)

here we suppose  = 0 instead of  = o(1) because this condition is used in
section 3 of [1]. in the similar way it occurs that all other integrands decrease
as o(n), or faster, i.e. they are zero on the black hole horizon. therefore, the
regge-teitelboim approach does not allow to derive expression (9) which is
(2.13) of paper [1]. this is absolutely natural, because conditions for applying
this method are just violated  variation f , induced by a hypersurface
deformation, does not full carlips restriction f /f = o(n) and really has
a form

 f = (cid:16)f r(cid:17),r

= o(n 1)  f,

that is, f /f = o(1). due to this reason the surface integral from equation
(2.10) of paper [1]

is nonzero, that should be qualied in regge-teitelboims terminology as
non-dierentiability of functional l[] = h[] + j[], where

j[] =

1

8g ir=r+

d2xnnaa

ro.

(16)

here we omit term na ak, which is present in [1], because later in the
consideration related to derivation of expression (2.13) carlip supposes that
krr = 0 = k and ignores this term.

4 the new poisson brackets

there is a more general hamiltonian approach where all functionals are ad-
missible, including those giving nonzero boundary contribution to the rst
variation. it was for the rst time shown in publication [5] that the standard
poisson bracket can be generalized by adding to it some divergence terms.
as a result, the bracket so generalized can generate variations with nonzero
surface contribution. this is just required in the case under consideration
when the surface is a black hole horizon. let us mention that two dierent
extensions of the formula proposed in [5] were suggested later. they can be
important in cases when surface contributions to functional variations con-
tain arbitrary spatial derivatives for variations of elds and their conjugate

7

momenta (generally speaking, arbitrary non-canonical variables): [6], [7]. an
attempt of comparison of these two dierent formulas was done in paper [9],
but here all give one and the same result.

let us explain this in more detail. let eld variables are not necessarily

canonical, but their poisson bracket is ultralocal

{a(x), b(y)} = iab(x, y),

then the standard bracket of two local functionals has the following form

{f, g} = z

dn1x

f

a(x)

iab

g

b(x)

,

and for a dierentiable functional we have

f = z

dn1x

f

a(x)

a(x).

let now deal with non-dierentiable functional in regge-teitelboims sense,
and let its rst variation has the simplest possible form with a surface term

f = z

dn1x

f

a(x)

a(x) +i

dn2x

f

a(x)

a(x).

then we can formally construct a full variational derivative as follows

f

a(x)

= ()

f

a(x)

+ ()

f

a(x)

,

to include a surface (or boundary) contribution (here () is the dirac
delta-function concentrated on the boundary of the integration region  and
() is the heaviside step function equal to 1 inside  and to 0 outside of
it). so, we treat the full variational derivative as follows

zrn1

dn1x

f

a(x)

a(x)  z

dn1x

f

a(x)

a(x)+i

dn2x

f

a(x)

a(x).

it is possible to put these full variational derivatives into the standard formula
for the poisson bracket (4) instead of the usual euler-lagrange derivatives.
then we get

{f, g}new = {f, g}old +i

dn2x

f
a

ga i

dn2x

g
a

f a+?!,

8

where

f a = iab

f
b

= {a, f},

ga = iab

g
b

= {a, g},

and ?! denotes the puzzling term corresponding to the delta-function squared.
in publication [5] it was demanded to kill this term by a boundary condition
which guarantees zero coecient before the dangerous expression [()]2:

(cid:18) f

a(x)

iab

g

b(x)(cid:19)

= 0.

further attempts to extend the result of publication [5] were gone in two
directions:

1. searching for regular expressions corresponding to terms like ?! [6];

2. postulating that these terms are absent in the nal formula [7].

therefore, the contribution to expression (9) (which is (2.13) of paper [1])

arises just due to non-dierentiability of functional l[]
8g ir=r+
l[] = z

ab ab(cid:19) 

dn1x(cid:18) h

the variation  f is easily determined from the equations of motion generated
by the hamiltonian l[]

r(cid:17) = (cid:16)f r(cid:17),r

.

(17)

by this way we get the rst surface contribution to the poisson bracket

is connected with the fact that the deformation parameters t themselves are
dependent on the canonical variables and so themselves have nonzero poisson

5 conclusion

we have shown that the validity of results of paper [1] is in fact based on
the application of the new formula for poisson brackets. this is unfortu-
nately not clear from the argumentation given in [1]. formulas (7) (which
is (2.11) of [1]) and (8) are not valid if the poisson bracket is dened by the
standard expression. so, we have one more testimony in favor of the move
to transcend the regge-teitelboim approach in studying the role of bound-
aries in the hamiltonian dynamics [6], [10], [11]. the author is grateful to
s.n. solodukhin for e-mail comment.
