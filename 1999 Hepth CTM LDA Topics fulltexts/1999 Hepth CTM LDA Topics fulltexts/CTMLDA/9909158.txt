thus four kinds photons specied directions polarization. canonical quantization implies scalar photons represented negative norm states. consequence manifest covariance quantization vector eld

must pair conserved quantities corresponding pair brs symmetries. hermitian called brs charges. mentioned two kinds hermitian fp ghost elds correspondingly brs charge must involve one ghost elds. follows keep one two charges simplicity. brs charge keep anticommuting fp ghost eld, consequently square brs charge vanishes called nilpotent. hermiticity nilpotency brs charge would imply indenite metric since otherwise would null operator . nilpotency important allows us introduce concept cohomology theory. long detour going introduce appropriate subsidiary condition. physical states dened states annihilated applying brs charge . fp ghost elds appear conventional qed also introduce although non-interacting elds. combine lorentz condition additional condition implying absence fp ghosts dene physical states. conditions satised, prove physical states dened annihilated brs charge qed. brs charge generator brs transformation brs transform operator given commutator anticommutator operator brs charge, transformation also nilpotent. operator brs transform another operator called exact operator, clear matrix element exact operator pair physical states vanishes. equation non-abelian gauge eld deviates classical maxwell equation fact divergence eld strength plus color current vanish equal certain exact operator, referred exact current hereafter. therefore, classical maxwell equation recovered take matrix element eld equation pair physical states. furthermore, brs charge commutes matrix. thus scenario qed reproduced almost exactly. single quark states single gluon

color connement signies unitarity condition matrix hadronic sector saturated hadronic intermediate states. means quarks gluons place show unitarity condition longitudinal scalar photons never appeared
