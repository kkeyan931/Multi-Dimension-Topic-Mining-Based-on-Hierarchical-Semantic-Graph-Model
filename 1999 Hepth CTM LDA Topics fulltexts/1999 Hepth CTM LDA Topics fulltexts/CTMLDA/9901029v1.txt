abstract

canonical formulation of quantum eld theory on the light front (lf) is re-
viewed. the problem of constructing the lf hamiltonian which gives the the-
ory equivalent to original lorentz and gauge invariant one is considered. we de-
scribe possible ways of solving this problem: (a) the limiting transition from the
equal-time hamiltonian in a fastly moving lorentz frame to lf hamiltonian, (b)
the direct comparison of lf perturbation theory in coupling constant and usual
lorentz-covariant feynman perturbation theory. gauge invariant regularization of
lf hamiltonian via introducing a lattice in transverse coordinates and imposing
periodic boundary conditions in lf coordinate x for gauge elds on the interval
|x| < l is considered. we nd that lf canonical formalism for this regularization
avoid usual most complicated constraints connecting zero and nonzero modes of
gauge elds.

1 introduction

v. a. fock has elaborated a beautiful method to describe state vectors in quantum eld
theory. the corresponding vector space is now called the fock space [1]. this method
plays very important role in quantum eld theory in light-front (lf) coordinates [2]:

x = (1/2)(x0  x3), x1, x2, where x0, x1, x2, x3 are lorentz coordinates. the x+ plays
the role of time, and canonical quantization is carried out on a hypersurface x+ = const.
the advantage of this scheme is connected with the positivity of the momentum p
(translation operator along x axis), which becomes quadratic in elds on the lf. as a
consequence the lowest eigenstate of the operator p is both physical vacuum and the
mathematical vacuum of perturbation theory [3]. using fock space over this vacuum
one can solve stationary schroedinger equation with hamiltonian p+ (translation operator
along x+ axis) to nd the spectrum of bound states. the problem of describing the
physical vacuum, very complicated in usual formulation with lorentz coordinates, does
not appear here. such approach, based on solving schrodinger equation on the lf, is
called lf hamiltonian approach. it attracts attention for a long time as a possible mean
for solving quantum field theory problems.

while giving essential advantages, the application of lf coordinates in quantum field
theory leads to some diculties. the hyperplane x+ = const is a characteristic surface for
relativistic dierential eld equations. it is not evident without additional investigation
that quantization on such hypersurface generates a theory equivalent to one quantized in
the usual way in lorentz coordinates [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. this is in particular es-
sential because of the special divergences at p = 0 appearing in lf quantization scheme.
beside of usual ultraviolet regularization one has to apply special regularization of such
divergences. we will consider the following simplest prescription of such regularization:

(a) cuto of momenta p

(b) cuto of the x

|p|  ,

 > 0;

 l  x  l.

(1.1)

(1.2)

with periodic boundary conditions in x for all elds.

the regularization (b) discretizes the spectrum of the operator p (p = n/l, where
n is an integer). this formulation is called sometime discretized lf quantization [14].
fourier components of elds, corresponding to p = 0 (and usually called zero modes)
turn out to be dependent variables and must be expressed in terms of nonzero modes via
solving constraint equations (constraints). these constraints are usually very complicated,
and solving of them is a dicult problem.

the prescriptions of regularization of divergences at p = 0 described above are con-
venient for hamiltonian approach, but both of them break lorentz invariance and the
prescription (a) breaks also the gauge invariance. therefore the equivalence of lf and
original lorentz (and gauge) invariant formulation can be broken even in the limit of

2

removed cuto. to avoid this inequivalence some modication of usual renormalization
procedure may be necessary, see for exsample [15] and [12].

in sect. 2 we give basic relations of quantum eld theory in lf coordinates.

the problem of constructing the lf hamiltonian which gives a theory equivalent to
original lorentz and gauge invariant one turned out to be rather dicult. now it is solved
only for nongauge eld theories [12]. we will describe possible approaches to this problem.
in
sect. 3 we consider the limiting transition from fast moving lorentz frame to the lf.
this transition relates the formulations in lorentz and lf coordinates [12]. in sect. 4 we
investigate the relation between lf perturbation theory in coupling constant and usual
lorentz-covariant feynman perturbation theory. for yukawa model this investigation
shows how to construct lf hamiltonian giving the theory perturbatively equivalent to
original one [12]. for gauge theories the methods developed in sect. 3 and sect. 4 do
not give the required lf hamiltonian due to specic diculties. in sect. 5 we consider
gauge invariant ultraviolet regularization of lf hamiltonian via introducing a lattice in
transverse coordinates x1, x2 and taking complex matrix variables for gauge elds on
links of the lattice [16]. we nd that lf canonical formalism for gauge theories with
this regularization avoid usual most complicated constraints connecting zero and nonzero
modes.

2 formal canonical quantization of field theory

on the light front and the problem of bound states.

in order to nd the bound state spectrum in some eld theory quantized on the lf the
following system of equations is usually solved:

p+|i = p +|i,
p|i = p 
|i,
p|i = 0,

where p = {p1, p2}. the mass of bound state is equal to

m = q2p +p .

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

it was taken into account that nonzero components of metric tensor in lf coordinates

are

g+ = g+ = 1,

g11 = g22 = 1.

(2.5)

the operators p, p are quadratic in elds, and the solution of equations (2.2), (2.3) is
not dicult. the problem is in solving the schroedinger equation (2.1). physical vacuum
|i is lowest eigenstate of the operator p, and
p+|i = 0,

(2.6)

3

p|i = 0,
p|i = 0.

(2.7)

(2.8)

to full equations (2.6), (2.7) one should subtract , if it is necessary, corresponding
renormalizing constants from the operators p+, p. the |i plays simultaneously the
role of mathematical vacuum of fock space. a solution |i of schrodinger eqn. (2.1)
belong to this space.
expressions for the operators p+, p can be obtained by canonical quantization on
the lf. let us describe the procedure of such quantization via some examples, without
analyzing so far the question about the equivalence of appearing theory and the orig-
inal lorentz-covariant one.
it is assumed that in addition to explicit regularization of
divergences at p = 0 necessary ultraviolet regularization is implied.

2.1 scalar selnteracting eld in (1+1)-dimensional

space-time.

peculiarities of lf quantization are well seen even in this simple example. we have only
lf coordinates x+, x. the lagrangian is equal to

or

l = z dx (cid:18) 

1
2

m22  4(cid:19) ,

l = z dx (cid:18) 1

2

+ 

1
2

m22  4(cid:19) ,

(2.9)

(2.10)

the time derivative + enters into this lagrangian only linearly. for the transition
2 + in standard

to canonical theory it is sucient to rewrite the expression r dx 1

form. to achieve this let us take the fourier decomposition

(x) = (2) 1

2



z0

dk |2k| 1

2 (cid:16)a(k) exp(ikx) + a+(k) exp(ikx)(cid:17) ,

(2.11)

where k  k, (x)  (x+, x), a(k)  a(x+, k). the lagrangian (2.10) takes the form

l =



z0

dk   a+(k) a(k)  a(k) a+(k)

2i

!  h,

where a  a/x+ and

h = z dx (cid:18)1

2

m22 + 4(cid:19) .

4

(2.12)

(2.13)

here we have used the equality



z0

dk



z0

dk (k + k)k(cid:16)a(k) a(k)  a+(k) a+(k)(cid:17) = 0.

(2.14)

it is implied that the function (x) in (2.13) is expressed in terms of a+(k) and a(k)
with the help of formulae (2.10). time derivatives a(k), a+(k) enter into lagrangian
l in a form standard for canonical theory. therefore one can interpret after quantiza-
tion the a+(k) and a(k) as creation and annihilation operators satisfying the following
commutation relations at xed x+ and k > 0, k  0:

[a(k), a+(k)] = (k  k),

[a(k), a(k)] = 0,

it is also seen that the h is lf hamiltonian, i.e. h = p+.

we have also the formulae

where the energy-momentum tensor t is equal to

p = z dx t,

t =   gl.

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

via this relation one can reproduce the expression (2.13) for p+  h , and obtain the
equality

p = z dx ()2 =

1
2



z0

dk k(cid:16)a+(k)a(k) + a(k)a+(k)(cid:17) .

the lowest eigen state of the operator p is the physical vacuum |i for which

a(k)|i = 0

(2.18)

(2.19)

at any k. it is seen that vacuum expectation values h|p|i, h|p+|i are innite. the
renormalization can be got by taking normal ordered forms : p+ :, : p : with respect to
the operators a+, a (the symbol :: means as usual that operators a+ stand everywhere
before of operators a). normal ordering of the 4 term in the hamiltonian p+ leads also
to renormalization of the mass. in the following, writing p+, p, we mean the expressions
: p+ :, : p :, satisfying conditions (2.6), (2.7). normal ordering of the operators p+, p
allows to avoid all ultraviolet divergences in this simple model.

2.2 theory of interacting scalar and fermion elds in

(3+1)- dimensional space-time (yukawa model).

the lagrangian of the model is

l = z d2xdx(cid:18) (i  m)  +

m22  g  3  4(cid:19) , (2.20)

where m is the fermion mass, m is the boson mass,  = +0,  = +; g, ,  are
coupling constants. here and so on , , . . . = +,, 1, 2; i, k, . . . = 1, 2; x  (x1, x2) . for
diracs -matrices we use:

0 =   0 ii

 =   i
where i is a unit 2  2 matrix,   {1, 2}, i are pauli matrices.

3 =   0

we introduce 2-component spinors , , writing

(2.21)

the lagrangian l can be written in the form

l = z d2xdx(cid:16)i2++ + i2+ +(cid:16)i+(cid:16)ii  m(cid:17)  + h.c.(cid:17) +

m22  ig(cid:16)+  +(cid:17)  3  4(cid:17),

ii 

1
2

2

(2.22)

where h.c. means hermitian conjugation. the variation of this lagrangian with respect
to + leads to the equation

2 = (cid:16)ii  m(cid:17)  + g.

(2.23)

this equation does not contain derivatives in x+ and therefore is a constraint. one
should solve it with respect to  and substitute the result into the lagrangian. in doing
this we must invert the operator  which becomes an operator of multiplication ik after
fourier transformation. inverse operator (ik)1 has singularity at k = 0. to avoid this
singularity we introduce the regularization (1.1). for any function f (x)  f (x+, x, x)
we dene fourier transform

f (x) =

1

2 z dk eikx f (k),

where f(k)  f (x+, k, x), and put

[f (x)] 

1

2 z dk eikx f (k),

|k|   > 0.

(2.24)

(2.25)

we insert into the lagrangian (2.22) the variables [], [+], [], [+], [] instead of ,

+, , +,  and obtain the constraint equation

2[] = (cid:16)ii  m(cid:17) [] + g[[][]]

instead of (2.23). its solution is

[] =

1
2

1

 (cid:16) (cid:16)ii  m(cid:17) [] + g[[][]](cid:17),

(2.26)

(2.27)

6

where the operator 1

 is completely dened by the condition

[f ]i .

 is replaced by (ik)1.
after fourier transformation the operator 1

[f ] = h1

1


substituting the expression (2.27) into the lagrangian (where all elds , +, . . . are

(2.28)

replaced with [], [+], . . .) we come to the result:

l = z d2xdx(cid:18)i2h+i + [] + []+[]+

2(cid:16)(cid:16)ii  m(cid:17) []  g[[][]](cid:17)+

(2.29)

as in sect. 2a time derivatives +[], +[] enter into the lagrangian (2.29) linearly.
therefore to go to canonical formalism it is sucient to nd a standard form for the
expression

i2[+]+[] + [+]+[]

(before quantization the quantities +,  are elements of grassman algebra). we write

[(x)] = (2)1/2

[r(x)] = (2)1/221/4

it is assumed that the quantities [], [+], [] in the formulae (2.34) are expressed in
terms of b, b+, c, c+, a, a+ with the help of (2.30), (2.31), (2.32).

it follows from (2.33) that a+, a, b+, b, c+, c play a role of creation and annihilation

operators. after quantization they satisfy the commutation relations (at x+ =const):

[a(k, x), a+(k
[b(k, x), b+(k
[c(k, x), c+(k

, x)] = (k  k
, x)]+ = (k  k
, x)]+ = (k  k

)2(x  x),
)2(x  x),
)2(x  x),

(2.35)

(2.36)

(2.37)

where [x, y] = xy  yx. the remaining (anti)commutators are equal to zero. it is seen
that the quantity h is lf hamiltonian (h = p+). the operator of the momentum p is
equal to

p = z d2xdx t =

+b+

r (k)br(k)  br(k)b+

2 z d2x
r (k) + c+

dk k(a+(k)a(k) + a(k)a+(k)+
r (k)cr(k)  cr(k)c+

r (k)).

(2.38)

the quantities p+  h and p should be normally ordered with respect to creation
and annihilation operators. the lowest eigenstate of the momentum p is the physical
vacuum. it is dened by conditions

a(k, x)|i = 0,

b(k, x)|i = 0,

c(k, x)|i = 0,

 x, k.

(2.39)

the equalities (2.6), (2.7) become true after normal ordering of the operators p+ and p.
for the p it is seen from the formulae (2.38), and for the p+ it follows from the fact
that every term of p+ contains a -function of dierence between the sum of momenta k
of creation operators and the sum of momenta k of annihilation operators. due to the
positivity of all momenta k, in our regularization scheme every term of the p+ contains
at least one annihilation operator. therefore for normally ordered p+ we have p+|i = 0.
the model under consideration requires ultraviolet regularization. it can be done in
dierent ways. we consider this question together with the renormalization problem in
sect. 3 and 4.

2.3 the u(n)-theory of pure gauge elds.

we consider the u(n) rather than the su(n) theory because it is technically more simple.
the transition to the su(n) can be done easily. gauge eld is described by hermitian
matrices

a(x) = a+

 (x)  naij

 (x)o ,

(2.40)

8

where  = +,, 1, 2; i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n. let us assume, that for the indexes i, j and
analogous the usual rule of summation on repeated indexes is not used, and where it is
necessary the sign of a sum is indicated. field strengths tensor is

f = a  a  ig[a, a],

and gauge transformation has the form

a  a = u +au +

i
g

u +u, u +u = i.

(2.41)

(2.42)

to escape a breakdown of gauge invariance we apply the regularization of the type (1.2)
with periodic boundary conditions

a(x+,l, x) = a(x+, l, x),

(2.43)

on the interval l  x  l. all fourier modes of a(x) in x must be kept, including
zero modes (at k = 0).

the lagrangian has the form

l = 

1

2 z d2x

or

l = z d2x

(2.44)

(2.45)

where k, k = 1, 2. time derivatives +ak are present only in the term

tr (2(ak  ka  ig[a, a+])+ak) .

this expression can be put in standard canonical form only after xing the gauge in a
special form of the type a = 0 because then the term above becames similar to that
of scalar eld theory tr (2(ak)+ak). however not every eld, periodic in x, can be
transformed to the a = 0 gauge. indeed, the loop integral

(x+, x) = tr


p exp


l

z

i
l

dx a(x+, x, x)





,

(2.46)

where the symbol p means the ordering of operators along the x, is a gauge invariant
quantity. if this integral is not equal to n for some eld then the gauge a = 0 is not
possible for this eld. therefore we choose more weak gauge condition

aij
 = 0,

i 6= j,

aii

 = 0,

(2.47)

9

and put

aii
(x) = vi(x+, x).

(2.48)

the gauge (2.47) breaks not only the local gauge invariance but unlike the a = 0 gauge,
also global gauge invariance (it remains only the abelian subgroup of gauge transforma-
tions not depending on x). this has some technical inconvenience but now any periodic
eld can be described in the gauge (2.47). furthermore, if we restrict the class of possible
periodic elds by the condition a = 0, disregarding the describe consideration, we come
to canonical theory with even more complicate constraints if zero modes are taken into
account [17, 18, 19].

from the point of view of lf canonical formalism the variables aij

 are coordinates.
therefore one can restrict their values by the condition (2.47) directly in the lagrangian
without loosing any equations of motion. let us introduce the denotations

where obviously

k = (  ig(vi  vj))aij

this scheme is connected with the following essential diculty. the zero modes

(2.79)

these constraints are of the 2nd class and they must be solved with respect to aii
k(0) and
then the aii
k(0) have to be excluded from the hamiltonian. the constraints (2.79) are very
complicated and explicit resolution of them is practically impossible. the application of
dirac brackets does not simplify this.

due to this diculty a practical calculation usually ignores all zero modes from the
begining. it makes the approximation worse. it is interesting that in the framework of
lattice regularization it is possible to overcome the diculties caused by the constraints
(2.79) [16]. this question will be considered in sect. 5.

3 limiting transition from the theory in lorentz coordinates

to the theory on the light front

to clarify the connection between the theory in lorentz coordinates in hamiltonian form
and analogous theory on the lf we perform the limiting transition from one to the
other. here this transition is considered in the xed frame of lorentz coordinates by
introducing states that move at a speed close to the speed of light in the direction of
the x3 axis. constructing the matrix elements of the hamiltonian between such states
and studying the limiting transition to the speed of light (an innite momentum), we can
derive information about the hamiltonian in the light-like coordinates. this information

14

also takes into account the contribution from intermediate states with nite momenta.
here, we illustrate the results of such an investigation using (1 + 1)-dimensional theory of
scalar eld with the 4-interaction. instead of x3 we denote analogous space coordinate
by x1. the generalization of the method to (3+1)-dimensional yukawa model is discussed
briey at the end of this section. the limiting transition studied here is accomplished
approximately by subjecting the momenta p1 to an auxiliary cuto that separates fast
modes of the elds (with high p1 values) from slow modes (with nite p1 values). this
cuto is parametrized in terms of the quantities , 1, and  and the limiting-transition
parameter  ( > 0,   0): we have 11  |p1|  1 for the fast modes and p1  
for the slow modes (  ). for   0, the inequality 1 >  holds, so that the above
momentum intervals are separated. the eld modes with the momenta 1 > |p1| > 
are discarded. this procedure is justied by the fact that the resulting hamiltonian in
the limit   0 reproduces the canonical light-front hamiltonian (without zero modes)
when only the fast modes are taken into account and is consistent with conventional
feynman perturbation theory for   0. therefore, even an approximate inclusion of
the other (slow) modes may provide a description of nonperturbative eects, such as
vacuum condensates. the eective light-front hamiltonian obtained here for the model
under consideration diers from the canonical hamiltonian only by the presence of the
vacuum expectation value of the scalar eld and by an additional renormalization of the
mass of this eld. the renormalized mass involves the vacuum expectation value of the
squared slow part of the eld. masses of bound states can be found by solving schrodinger
equation

p+|i =

m2

2p|i,

(3.1)

with obtained hamiltonian p+.

we start from the standard expression for the hamiltonian of scalar eld (x) in

(1 + 1)-dimensional space-time in lorentz coordinates x = (x0, x1), at x0 = 0:

h =: z d1x  1

(3.2)

where (x1) are the variables that are canonically conjugate to (x1)  (x0 = 0, x1), and
the symbol :
: of the normal ordering refers to the creation and annihilation operators
a and a+ that diagonalize the free part of the hamiltonian in the fock space over the
corresponding vacuum |0i. these operators are given by

(x1) =

1

4 z dp1(m2 + p2

1)1/4ha(p1) exp(ip1x1) + h.c.i ,

(x1) = i

4 z dp1(m2 + p2

1)1/4ha(p1) exp(ip1x1)  h.c.i ,

(3.3)

(3.4)

where a(p1)|0i = 0.

15

to investigate the limiting transition to the light-front hamiltonian (dened at x+ =
0), it is more convenient to go over from the hamiltonian (3.2) to the operator h + p1 =
2p+, where the momentum p1 has the form

p1 = z dp1a+(p1)a(p1)p1.

(3.5)

applying the above parametrization of high momenta in terms of ,   0, to p1 we
can then consider the transition to an innitely high momentum of states as a limit of the
corresponding lorentz transformation with parameter . to be more specic, we have

p1  (2)1q, where q is a nite momentum in the light-like coordinates, and

lim

0(cid:16)(2)1hp1|(h + p1)x0=0|p1i(cid:17) = hq

|(p+)x+=0|qi.

(3.6)

it follows that the eigenvalues e+ of the operator (p+)x+=0 that correspond to the mo-
mentum q are obtained as the corresponding limit of the eigenvalues e() of the operator
(h + p1)x0=0 at momentum p1:

(2)1e().

e+ = lim
0

(3.7)

in the following, we consider this limiting transition as a part of the eigenvalue problem
for the operator h + p1, using perturbation theory in the parameter . separating the
fourier modes of the eld into fast and slow ones, as is indicated above, and neglecting the
region of intermediate momenta (1  |p1|  11 is the region of the fast modes, and
|p1|   is the region of the slow modes), we can substantially simplify this perturbation
theory. the  dependence of the eld operators and hamiltonian can then be determined
by making, in the region of fast momenta, the change of the variables as

p1 = 1k,

a(p1) = a(k),

  |k|  1,

[a(k), a+(k)] = (k  k).

(3.8)

the fast part [(x1)]f of the operator (x1) is estimated as

[(x1)]f = (y) + o(2),

y = 1x1,

(y) = (4)1/2z dk|k|1/2[a(k) exp(iky) + h.c.].

(3.9)

(3.10)

we denote the slow part of the eld  by  ( = []f + ). substituting formulas
(3.8)-(3.10) into hamiltonian (3.2), we obtain

h + p1 = 1(cid:16)h0 + h1 + 2h2 + . . .(cid:17) ,

prior to performing integration with respect to y, we formally expanded the operators
(x1) = (y) in taylor series in the variable y and estimated their orders in the
parameter  at xed y. such estimates can be justied at least in feynman perturbation
theory. the operator ( h+ p1 in (3.13) is dened in such a way that its minimum eigenvalue
is zero. let us consider perturbation theory in the parameter  for the equation

(h + p1)|fi = e|fi

(3.15)

under the condition that the states |fi have, as in formula (3.6), a negative value of
p1 proportional to 1 for   0 and also describe the states with a nite mass. the
expansions of the quantity e and the vector |fi in power series in  can then be written
as

e = 1 
xn=2

nen,

|fi =



xn=0

n|fni.

we arrive at the system of equations

h0|f0i = 0,

h0|f1i + h1|f0i = 0,

h0|f2i + h1|f1i + (h2  e2)|f0i = 0,

. . . .

(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)

to describe solutions to these equations, we use the basis generated by the fast-eld
operators a+(k) over the vacuum |0i and the slow-eld operators  and  over the vacuum
|vi that corresponds to the hamiltonian ( h + p1). the vectors of this basis can be
symbolically represented as

a+ . . . a+|0i  . . .   . . . |vi.

(3.20)

by virtue of (3.12), the manifold of solutions |f0i to equation (3.17) is reduced to the set
of vectors (3.20), which do not contain the operators a+(k) with k  . let p0 be the
projection operator onto this set. according to equation (3.18), we then have

p0h0|f1i = ( h + p1)|f0i = 0.

(3.21)

equation (3.21) requires that the vectors |f0i be the lowest eigenstates of the operator
( h + p1), that is, linear combinations of basis vectors (3.20) including neither the operators

17

a+(k) with k   nor the operators  and . we denote the projection operator on this
set of vectors (3.20) by p0. to determine the quantity e2 which we are interested in, it
is sucient to consider the p0-projection of equation (3.19). taking into account (3.17),
(3.20), and (3.21), we nd that e2 appears as a solution to the eigenvalue problem

p0h2|f0i = e2|f0i.

(3.22)

thus, in accordance with (3.6) and (3.7), the operator p0h2p0 plays the role of the eec-
tive light-front hamiltonian p ef f
+ . substituting formula (3.14) for the operator h2 into the
expression for p ef f
+ , we take into account that, between the projection operators p0, the
contribution of the eld modes with positive momenta (k  ) vanishes and that the prod-
ucts of the operators of the slow part of the eld can be replaced with their expectation
values for the vacuum |vi. in addition, we note that, under the lorentz transformation
corresponding to the limiting transition   0 in formula (3.6), the variable y goes over
into the light-like coordinate y = y/2, the momenta k go over into the light-like
momenta q = 2k, and the corresponding coordinate y+ vanishes at x0 = 0 (for nite
(q  2)
values of y). going over to the operators a(q) = 21/4a(k) for k  
and to the corresponding eld (y+ = 0, y) = (y), where  is the part of the 
containing only the modes with negative momenta (k  ), we obtain the eective
hamiltonian p ef f

in the form

+

p ef f

+ =: z dy(cid:26)1

2 hm2 + 12h: 2 :ivi 2 + 4h iv3 + 4(cid:27) :,

(3.23)

where h. . .iv is the expectation value for the vacuum |vi. expression (3.23) coincides with
the canonical eective hamiltonian if, in the latter, we take into account the shift of the
eld by the constant h iv and the change in the mass squared by 12 [h: 2 :iv  h i2
v].
analogous results were obtained for yukawa model in (3 + 1)-dimensional space-time
[9]. in regularization of pauli-villars type, introducing a number of nonphysical elds with
very large masses. the absence of essential dierence between the hamiltonian obtained
via limiting transition and canonical lf hamiltonian is connected with this choice of
regularization. other regularizations can lead to more complicated results.

this method of limiting transition can not be directly expanded to gauge theories,

because the approximations used for nongauge theories are not justied.

4 comparison of light front perturbation theory

with the theory in lorentz coordinates

as is already known, canonical quantization in lf, i.e., on the x+ = const hypersurface,
can result in a theory not quite equivalent to the lorentz-invariant theory (i.e., to the
standard feynman formalism). this is due, rst of all, to strong singularities at zero
values of the light-like momentum variables q = 12(q0  q3). to restore the equiva-
lence with a lorentz-covariant theory, one has to add unusual counter-terms to the formal

18

canonical hamiltonian for the lf, h = p+. these counter-terms can be found by compar-
ing the perturbation theory based on the canonical lf formalism with lorentz-covariant
perturbation theory. this is done in the present section. the light-front hamiltonian
thus obtained can then be used in nonperturbative calculations. it is possible, however,
that perturbation theory does not provide all of the necessary additions to the canonical
hamiltonian, as some of these additions can be nonperturbative. in spite of this, it seems
necessary to examine this problem within the framework of perturbation theory rst.

for practical purposes a stationary noncovariant light-front perturbation theory, which
is similar to the one applied in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, is widely used.
it
was found [20, 21, 22] that the light-front dyson formalism allows this theory to be
transformed into an equivalent light-front feynman theory (under an appropriate regu-
larization). then, by re-summing the integrands of the feynman integrals, one can recast
their form so that they become the same as in the lorentz-covariant theory. (this is not
the case for diagrams without external lines, which we do not consider here.) then, the
dierence between the light-front and lorentz-covariant approaches that persists is only
due to the dierent regularizations and dierent methods of calculating the feynman in-
tegrals (which is important because of the possible absence of their absolute convergence
in pseudo-euclidean space). in the present section, we concentrate on the analysis of this
dierence.

a light-front theory needs not only the standard uv regularization, but also a spe-
cial regularization of the singularities q = 0. in our approach, this regularization (by
method (1.1)) eliminates the creation operators a+(q) and annihilation operators a(q)
with |qi
| <  from the fourier expansion of the eld operators in the eld representa-
tion. as a result, the integration w.r.t. the corresponding momentum q over the range
(,)  (,) is associated with each line before removing the -functions. dier-
ent propagators are regularized independently, which allows the described re-arrangement
of the perturbation theory series. on the other hand, this regularization is convenient
for further nonperturbative numerical calculations with the light-front hamiltonian, to
which the necessary counter-terms are added (the eective hamiltonian). we require
that this hamiltonian generate a theory equivalent to the lorentz-covariant theory when
the regularization is removed. note that lorentz-invariant methods of regularization (e.g.,
pauli-villars regularization) are far less convenient for numerical calculations and we shall
only briey mention them.

the specic properties of the light-front feynman formalism manifest themselves only
in the integration over the variables q = 12 (q0  q3), while integration over the trans-
verse momenta q  {q1, q2} is the same in the light-front and the lorentz coordinates
(though it might be nontrivial because it requires regularization and renormalization).
therefore, we concentrate on a comparison of diagrams for xed transverse momenta
(which is equivalent to a two-dimensional problem).

in this section, we propose a method that allows one to nd the dierence (in the limit
  0) between any light-front feynman integral and the corresponding lorentz-covariant
integral without having to calculate them completely. based on this method, a procedure
is elaborated for constructing an eective hamiltonian in lf in any order of perturbation

19

theory. the procedure can be applied to all nongauge eld theories, as well as to abelian
and non-abelian gauge theories in the gauge a = 0 with the vector meson propagator
chosen according to the mandelstam-leibbrandt prescription [23, 24]. the question of
whether the additional components of the hamiltonian that arise can be combined into a
nite number of counter-terms must be dealt with separately in each particular case.

application of this formalism to the yukawa model makes it possible to obtain the
eective light-front hamiltonian in a closed form. the result agrees with the conclusions
of the work [20], where a comparison was made of the light-front and lorentz-covariant
methods via calculating self-energy diagrams in all orders of perturbation theory and other
diagrams in lowest orders. conversely, for gauge theories (both abelian and non-abelian),
it was found that counter-terms of arbitrarily high order in eld operators must be added
to the eective hamiltonian. this result may turn out to be wrong if the contributions
to the counter-terms are mutually canceled. this calls for further investigation, but such
possibility appears to be very unlikely.

what we have said above does not depreciate the light-front formalism as applied to
gauge theories. this is because the only requirement concerning the light-front hamil-
tonian is that it correctly reproduces all gauge-invariant quantities rather than the o-
mass-shell feynman integrals in a given gauge. however, renormalization of the light-front
hamiltonian turns out to be a dicult problem and it requires new approaches. we do
not examine the possibilities of changing the light-front hamiltonian by introducing new
nonphysical elds by a method dierent from the pauli-villars regularization [25] or the
possibilities of using gauges more general than a = 0 with the mandelstam-leibbrandt
propagator. these points also need to be investigated further.

4.1 reduction of light-front and lorentz-covariant feynman

integrals to a form convenient for comparison

let us examine an arbitrary ipi feynman diagram. we x all external momenta and all
transverse momenta of integration, and integrate only over q+ and q:

or

z(q) q+

(q2  m2 + i)(2q+q + i)

,

(4.2)

where z(q) is a polynomial. a propagator of the second type in (4.2) arises in gauge
theories in the gauge a = 0 if the mandelstam-leibbrandt formalism [23, 24] with the
vector boson propagator

i = 0.
the function f involves the numerators of all propagators and all vertices with the
necessary -functions, that include the external momenta pk (the same expression without
the -functions is a polynomial, which we denote by f). we assume for the diagram f
and for all of its subdiagrams that the conditions

2 6= 0, where mi is the particle mass, or m 2

i + qi


k < 0,

+ < 0,

(4.3)

hold, where + is the index of divergence w.r.t. q+ at qi
 6= 0 i, and k is the index
of divergence in q+ and q (simultaneously); q = 12 (q0  q3). the diagrams that
do not meet these conditions should be examined separately for each particular theory
(their number is usually nite). we seek the dierence between the value of integral
(4.1) obtained by the lorentz-covariant calculation and its value calculated in light-front
coordinates (light-front calculation).

in the light-front calculation, one introduces and then removes the light-front cuto

this case, we assume that we do not take the limit, but take the sum of all nonpositive
power terms of the laurent series in  at the zero point. if conditions (4.3) are satised,
statement 2 from appendix i can be used. this results in the equality

note that before taking the limit in , eqs. (4.12) and (4.14) can be used successfully:
rst, they are applied to a subdiagram and, then, are substituted into the formula for the

the subdiagram converges (after integration over the variables {qk

absolutely and uniformly with respect to the remaining loop momenta {qk
}. therefore,
one can interchange the integrals over {qk
thus, the dierence between the light-front and lorentz-covariant calculations of the
diagram is given by the sum of all of its congurations. a conguration of a diagram is

least one type-1 line exists.

ps

 6= 0, xs

(4.15)

where the summation is taken over any subset of external momenta; all of these momenta
are assumed to be directed inward.

let us consider an arbitrary conguration. we apply the term -line to all type-1
lines and those full lines for which integration over q actually does not expand outside
the domain (r, r), where r is a nite number (below, we explain when these lines
appear). the remaining full lines are called -lines. in the diagrams, the -lines and -
lines are denoted as shown in figs. 1d and e, respectively. note that the diagram can be
drawn with lines a and c from fig. 1 (this denes the conguration unambiguously),
or with lines d and e (then the conguration is not uniquely dened).

if among the lines arriving at the vertex only one is full and the others are type-1
lines, this full line is an -line by virtue of the momentum conservation at the vertex. the
remaining full lines form a subdiagram (probably unconnected). by virtue of conditions
(4.15), there is a connected part to which all of the external lines are attached. all
of the external lines of the remaining connected parts are -lines. consequently, using
statement 1 from appendix 1, we can see that integration over the internal momenta of
these connected parts can be carried out in a domain of order  in size, i.e., all of their
internal lines are -lines. thus, an arbitrary conguration can be drawn as in fig. 2 and
integral (4.14), with the corresponding integration domain, is associated with it.

expression 1/(2q + i/q+) (eq. (4.16)), which is related to the -line, is equal to -1.

 (the latter
integral converges uniformly in ). let us examine the convergence of the integral over
ql

+ with canceled denominators of the -lines (which is equivalent to estimating the
expressions (4.19) by a constant). if it converges, then the initial integral is obviously
independent of  and the contribution from this sector to the conguration is proportional
to  .

25

let us show that if it diverges with a degree of divergence , the contribution to the
initial integral is proportional to  up to logarithmic corrections. to this end, we
divide the domain of integration over ql
+ into two regions: u1, which lies inside a
sphere of radius / ( is xed), and u2, which lies outside this sphere (recall that in our
reasoning, we deal with each sector separately). now we estimate (4.18) (like (4.19)) in

(4.20)

after  is factored out of the numerator and the volume element, the integrand becomes
independent of . thus, the integral converges.

one can choose such  (independent of ) that the contribution from the domain u2
is smaller in absolute value than the contribution from the domain u1. consequently,
the whole integral can he estimated via the integral over the nite domain u1. now we
make an inverse replacement in (4.20) and estimate (4.19) by a constant (as above). since
the size of the integration domain is / and the degree of divergence is , the integral
behaves as  (up to logarithmic corrections), q.e.d. this reasoning is valid for each
sector and, thus, for the conguration as a whole. obviously,

(4.21)

where r is the subdiagram divergence index and the maximum is taken over all subdia-
grams dr (including unconnected subdiagrams for which r is the sum of the divergence
indices of their connected parts). in the case under consideration, r = r
+ + r, where
r is the number of internal -lines in the subdiagram dr. the quantities r
are the uv

divergence indices of the subdiagram dr w.r.t. q.

above, we introduced a quantity  , which is equal to the power of  that stems
from the numerators and volume elements of the entire conguration. we can write  =
r
r +r +r, where r is the index of the uv divergence in q of a smaller subdiagram
(probably, a tree subdiagram or a nonconnected one) consisting of -lines entering dr.
the term r is the power of  in the common factor, which, during transformation (4.17),
stems from the volume elements and numerators of the lines that did not enter dr. (it
is implied that the integration momenta are chosen in the same way as when calculating
the divergence indices of dr.) then, up to logarithmic corrections, we have

(4.22)

consequently, for   0, the conguration is equal to zero if  > 0. relation (4.22) allows
all essential congurations to be distinguished.

4.4 correction procedure and analysis of counter-terms

we want to build a corrected light-front hamiltonian h cor
| > , which
would generate greens functions that coincide in the limit   0 with covariant greens

lf with the cuto |qi

26

functions within the perturbation theory. we begin with a usual canonical hamiltonian
in the light-front coordinates hlf with the cuto |qi
| > . we imply that the integrands
of the feynman diagrams derived from this light-front hamiltonian coincide with the
covariant integrands after some resummation [20, 21, 22]. however, a dierence may
arise due to the various methods of doing the integration, e.g., due to dierent auxiliary
regularizations. as shown in sec. 4.2, this dierence (in the limit   0) is equal to
the sum of all properly arranged congurations of the diagram. one should add such
correcting counter-terms to hlf, which generates additional counter-term diagrams,
that reproduce nonzero (after taking limit w.r.t. ) congurations of all of the diagrams.
were we able to do this, we would obtain the desired h cor
. in fact, we can only show how
to seek the h cor
that generates the greens functions coinciding with the covariant ones
everywhere except the null set in the external momentum space (dened by condition
(4.15)). however, this restriction is not essential because this possible dierence does not
aect the physical results.

lf

lf

our correction procedure is similar to the renormalization procedure. we assume that
the perturbation theory parameter is the number of loops. we carry out the correction
by steps: rst, we nd the counterterms to the hamiltonian that generate all nonzero
congurations of the diagrams up to the given order and, then, pass to the next order.
we take into account that this step involves the counter-term diagrams that arose from
the counter-terms added to the hamiltonian for lower orders. thus, at each step, we
introduce new correcting counter-terms that generate the dierence remaining in this
order. let us show how to successfully look for the correcting counter-terms.

we call a conguration nonzero if it does not vanish as   0. we call a nonzero
conguration primary if  is a tree subdiagram in it (see fig. 2). note that for this
conguration, breaking any -line results in a violation of conditions (4.15); then, the
resulting diagram is not a conguration. we say that the conguration is changed if all of
the -lines in the related integral (4.14) are expanded in series in  (see the reasoning above
eq. (4.18) in sec. 4.3) and only those terms that do not vanish in the limit   0 after
the integration are retained. as mentioned above, developing this series and integration
are interchangeable operations. thus, in the limit   0, the changed and unchanged
congurations coincide. therefore, we always require that the hamiltonian counter-terms
generate changed congurations, as this simplies the form of the counter-terms. using
additional terms in the hamiltonian, one can generate only counter-term diagrams, which
are equal to zero for external momenta meeting the condition |ps
| < , because with the
cuto used, the external lines of the diagrams do not carry momenta with |ps
| < . we
bear this in mind in what follows.
we seek counter-terms by the induction method. it is clear that, in the rst order
in the number of loops, all nonzero congurations are primary. we add the counter-
terms that generate them to the hamiltonian. now, we examine an arbitrary order of
perturbation theory. we assume that in lower orders, all nonzero congurations that can
be derived from the counter-terms, accounting for the above comment, have already been
generated by the hamiltonian.

let us proceed to the order in question. first, we examine nonzero congurations

27

with only one loop momentum k and a number of momenta q (see the notation above
eq. (4.17)). we break the conguration lines one by one without touching the other lines
(so that the ends of the broken lines become external lines). the line break may result in
a structure that is not a conguration (if conditions (4.15) are violated); a line break may
also result in a zero conguration or in a nonzero conguration. if the rst case is realized
for each broken line, then the initial conguration is primary and it must be generated
by the counter-terms of the hamiltonian in the order under consideration. if breaking of
each line results in either the rst or the second case, we call the initial conguration real
and it must be also generated in this order.

assume that breaking a line results in the third case. this means that the resulting
conguration stems from counter-terms in the lower orders. then, after restoration of
the broken line (i.e., after the appropriate integration), it turns out that the counter-
terms of the lower orders have generated the initial conguration (we take into account
the comment on successive application of eq. (4.14); see the end of sec. 4.2) with the
following distinctions: (i) the broken line (and, probably, some others, if a nonsimply
connected diagram arises after breaking the line) is not a -line but a type-2 line, due
to the conditions |ps
| > ; (ii) if, after restoration of the broken line, the behavior at
small  becomes worse (i.e.,  decreased), then fewer terms than are necessary for the
initial conguration were considered in the above-mentioned series in . we expand
these arising type-2 lines by formula (4.13) and obtain a term where all of these lines
are replaced by -lines or other terms where some (or all) of these lines have become
type-1 lines. in the latter case, one of the momenta q becomes the momentum k. we
call these terms repeated parts of the conguration and analyze them together with
the congurations that have two momenta k. in the former case, we obtain the initial
conguration up to distinction (ii). we add a counter-term to the hamiltonian that
compensates this distinction (the counter-term diagrams generated by it are called the
compensating diagrams).

if there is only one line for which the third case is realized, it turns out that, in the
given order, it is not necessary to generate the initial conguration by the counter-terms,
except for the compensating addition and the repeated part that is considered at the next
step. if there are several lines for which the third case is realized, the initial conguration
is generated in lower orders more than once. for compensation, it should be generated
(with the corresponding numerical coecient and the opposite sign) by the hamiltonian
counter-terms in the given order. we call this conguration a secondary one. next, we
proceed to examine congurations with two momenta k and so on up to congurations
with all momenta k, which are primary congurations.

thus, the congurations to be generated by the hamiltonian counter-terms can be
primary (not only the initial primary congurations but also the repeated parts analogous
to them, called primary-like), real, compensating, and secondary. if the theory does not
produce either the loop consisting only of lines with q+ in the numerator (accounting
n in the numerator for n > 1, then
for contributions from the vertices) or a line with q+
real congurations are absent because a line without q+ in the numerator can always be
broken without increasing  (see eq. (4.22)). it is not dicult to demonstrate that if each

28

appearing primary, real, and compensating conguration has only two external line, then
there are no secondary congurations at all.

the dependence of the primary conguration on external momenta becomes trivial
if its degree of divergence  is positive, the maximum in formula (4.21) is reached on
the diagram itself, and  = 0. then, only the rst term is taken into account in the
above-mentioned series. thus, not all of the -line-related propagators and vertex factors
depend on km
} in (4.14).

we then obtain

here we neglect terms of order  in the denominator because the singularity at km

integrable under the given conditions for  and everything can be calculated in zero order
in  at  = 0. thus, the dependence on external momenta can be completely collected
into an easily obtained common factor.

4.5 application to the yukawa model

the yukawa model involves diagrams that do not satisfy condition (4.3). these are
displayed in figs. 3a and b. we have k = 0 for diagram a and + = 0 for diagram
b.

nevertheless, these diagrams can be easily included in the general scheme of reasoning.
to this end, one should subtract the divergent part, independent of external momenta,
in the integrand of the logarithmically divergent (in two-dimensional space, with xed
internal transverse momenta) diagram a. we obtain an expression with k < 0 (i.e.,

29

which converges in two-dimensional space) and + = 0, as in diagram b. this means
that the integral over q+ converges only in the sense of the principal value (and it is
this value of the integral that should be taken in the light-front coordinates to ensure
agreement with the stationary noncovariant perturbation theory). this value can be
obtained by distinguishing the q+-even part of the integrand.

two approaches are possible. one is to introduce an appropriate regularization in
transverse momenta and to imply integration over them; then, it is convenient to dis-
tinguish the part that is even in four-dimensional momenta q. the other is to keep all
transverse momenta xed; then, the part that is even in longitudinal momenta qk can be
released. for the yukawa theory, we use the rst approach. for the transverse regular-
ization, we use a smearing of vertices, which is equivalent to dividing each propagator
2. in four-dimensional space, diagram a diverges quadratically. under
by 1 + qi

introduction and subsequent removal of the transverse regularization, the divergent part,
which was previously subtracted from this diagram, acquires the form c1 + c2 p2
.

after separating the even part of the regularized expression, we x all of the transverse
momenta again. then it turns out that diagrams a and b in fig. 3 meet conditions
(4.3) and one can show that after all of the operations mentioned, the exponent  (see
(4.22)) does not decrease for any of their congurations. hence, they can be included in
the general scheme without any additional corrections.

2/

let us rst analyze the primary congurations (see the denition in sec. 4.4). in the
numerators, k appears only in the zero or one power and there are no loops where the
numerators of all of the lines contain k. consequently, one always has  > 0, r  0,
and r  0 (see the denitions in sec. 4.3). analyzing the properties of the expression
r
  r
+ for the yukawa model diagrams, we conclude from (4.22) that   0 always
holds. the general form of the nonzero primary congurations with  = 0 is depicted in
fig. 4. note that they are all congurations with two external line.

fig. 4: nonzero congurations in the yukawa model: p is the external momentum, and +
or  symbols on the line indicate that the corresponding term is taken in the numerator
of the propagator. in conguration b, the part that is proportional to + is taken.

further, it is clear that there are no nonzero real congurations (see the comment at the
end of sec. 4.4), and it can be shown by induction that there are no nonzero compensating
or secondary congurations either (the denitions are given in sec. 4.4 also). thus, only
primary or primary-like congurations can be nonzero and all of them have the form

30

shown in fig. 4. it can be shown that their degree of divergence  is positive and the
maximum in formula (4.21) is reached for the diagram itself. thus, the reasoning above
and below formula (4.23) applies to them. then, denoting the congurations displayed
in figs. 4a-d by da  dd, we arrive at the equalities da = +
cb, dc = cc
p
and dd = cd, where the expressions ca  cd depend only on the masses and transverse
momenta, but not on the external longitudinal momenta, and have a nite limit as   0.
now we assume that da  dd are not single congurations but are the sums of all con-
gurations of the same form and that integration over the internal transverse momenta has
already been carried out, (with the above-described regularization). in four-dimensional
space, the diagrams da and db diverge linearly while dc and dd diverge quadratically.
therefore, because of the transverse regularization, the coecients cc and cd in the limit
of removing this regularization take the form c1+c2p2
, where c1 and c2 do not depend on
the external momenta (neither do ca, cb)). thus, to generate all nonzero congurations
by the light-front hamiltonian, only the expression

ca, db = +
p

hc = c1 2 + c2 p2


2 + c3 

+
p

,

(4.24)

should be added, where  and  are the boson and fermion elds, respectively, and ci,
are the constant coecients.

comparing (4.24) with the initial canonical light-front hamiltonian, one can easily
see that the found counter-terms are reduced to a renormalization of various terms of
the hamiltonian (in particular the boson mass squared and the fermion mass squared
without changing the fermion mass itself). the explicit lorentz invariance is absent,
which compensates the violation of the lorentz invariance inherent, in the light-front
formalism.

note that in the framework of the second approach, mentioned at the beginning of this
section, one can obtain the same results. the only dierence is that in two-dimensional
space, the contributions from the congurations displayed in fig. 3 would additionally
depend on external transverse momenta. however, this dependence disappears after inte-
gration over internal transverse momenta with the introduction and subsequent removal
of an appropriate regularization.

in the pauli villars regularization, it is easy to verify that the expression r

+ 
r +r from (4.22) increases. this is because the number of terms in the numerators of the
propagator increases. then, the contribution from the -lines does not change, while the
-lines belonging to dr make zero contribution to r
+ and r, but 1 contribution
to r. since  > 0, this regularization makes it possible to meet the condition  > 0
for the congurations that were nonzero (one additional boson eld and one additional
fermion eld are enough). then it turns out that the canonical light-front hamiltonian
need not be corrected at all.

all of the above reasoning was organized such that it could be applied to a theory like this

tions with arbitrarily large numbers of external lines. an example of such a conguration
is given in fig. 5.

indeed, using formula (4.22), we can see that for the conguration in fig. 5,  = 0

the pauli-villars regularization does not improve the situation because it does not aect

thus, within the framework of the above-described method for correcting the canonical
light-front hamiltonian of the gauge theory, an innite number of counter-terms must be
added to the hamiltonian. note, however, that the formulated conditions for the vanishing
of the conguration are sucient, but, generally speaking, not necessary. because of this
and because of the possible cancellation of dierent congurations after integration w.r.t.
transverse momenta, the number of necessary counter-terms may be smaller.

5 transverse lattice regularization of gauge theories

on the light front

ultraviolet regularization of nonabelian gauge theories via introduction of space-time
lattice is widely used in nonperturbative considerations [27]. this regularization is in-
troduced in a gauge invariant way. for canonical formulation on the lf we use trans-
verse lattice regularization of bardeen-pearson type [28] which allows the action to be

32

polynomial in independent variables. as before we formulate the theory on the interval
l  x  l assuming periodic boundary conditions for all elds in x. further we
consider again the u(n) theory of pure gauge elds because this example is technically
more simple than the su(n) theory.

the components of gauge eld along continuous coordinates x+, x can be taken
without modication and related to the sites of the lattice. transverse components are
described with complex n  n matrices mk(x), k = 1, 2. each matrix mk(x) is related
to the link directed from the site x  ek to the site x. the transverse vector ek connects
two neighbouring sites on the lattice being directed along the positive axis xk (|ek|  a):

v
x  ek

mk(x)

the matrix m +

k (x) is related to the same link but with opposite direction:

v

in this section for the index k the usual rule of summation on repeated indices is not
used, and where it is necessary the sign of a sum is indicated. the elements of these
matrices are considered as independent variables. for any closed directed loop on the
lattice we can construct the trace of the product of matrices mk(x) sitting on the links
and order from the right to the left along this loop. for example the expression

tr nm2(x)m1(x  e2)m +

2 (x  e1)m +

1 (x)o

is related to the loop shown in g. 6.

it should be noticed that a trace related to closed loop, consisting of one and the same
link passed in both directions, is not identically unity because the matrices mk are not
unitary (see, for example, g. 7).

the unitary matrices u(x) of gauge transformations act on the m and m + in the

following way:

mk(x)  mk(x) = u(x)mk(x)u +(x  ek),

m +

k (x)  m+

k (x) = u(x  ek)m +

k (x)u +(x).

(5.1)

to connect these matrices with usual gauge eld of continuum theory we can write

in this formulation there are no most complicated constraints like (2.79) for the zero

reappear in a form which contains quantum operators in a denite order. this order was
not clear earlier.

and require that this value be nite. for the physical states with p = 0 we can nd a
state giving minimum to the hamiltonian. we consider this state as the vacuum state.
here the problem is to solve the reduced schroedinger equation with variables vi and i
v
which are independent of x.

analog of this lattice formulation in (2 + 1)-dimensions with the hamiltonian modied
by addition of some eective interaction terms, while ignoring all zero modes in x, was
considered in [29, 30] in the framework of color dielectric model approach [31, 32]. the
results of mass spectrum calculation at strong coupling can be tted to the spectrum
obtained with usual wilson-polyakov lattice theory [27]. however the continuum limit
cannot be reached in this model.

in our lattice formulation the diculty with going to weak coupling limit (g  0)
becomes more transparent. the resulting hamiltonian, written in the canonical variables,
explicitly contains the terms with zero modes (in x) having coupling constant in the
denominator, so that usual perturbative limit does not exist. for example the vacuum
state corresponding to zero vacuum expectation values of mk(x) does not coincide with
continuum theory vacuum where these values must be unity. a possible solution of this
problem can be found in a modication of canonical lf formulation excluding zero modes
in x while modifying the lf hamiltonian so that the theory remains equivalent to original
lorentz and gauge invariant formulation after removing the regularizations. one can tried
to do this by comparison of corresponding perturbation theory series.

6 conclusion

the lf hamiltonian approach to quantum field theory briey reviewed here is an at-
tempt to apply a beautiful idea of fock space representation for quantum eld nonpertur-
batively in the framework of canonical formulation on the lf. the problem of describing
the physical vacuum state becomes formally trivial in this approach because such vacuum
state coincides with mathematical vacuum of lf fock space.

however the breakdown of lorentz and gauge symmetries due to regularizations gen-
erates diculties in proving the equivalence of lf formalism and usual one in lorentz
coordinates. this problem can be solved for nongauge theories but turns out to be very
dicult for gauge theories in special (lf) gauge which is needed here. nevertheless we
hope that these diculties can be overcome by nding a modied form of canonical lf
hamiltonian which generates the perturbation theory equivalent to usual covariant and
gauge invariant one.

then both sides of eq. (a.1.1) become the sum of expressions of the same form in which,

the integral over {qk

a clamping of the contour or the point qi

easy to check that this bending is possible. (since the contours of integration over qk

are bent and qi
, one should only check that such bk exist,

where the necessary bi are expressed in the same way, i.e., that bi obey the conservation
laws and ow only along the full lines). with this bending, rather small in relation to the
deviation and the size of the deviation region, the contours do not pass through the poles
because, for the denominator of each line from the set in question, we have

after bending the contours, integral (a.1.2) is absolutely convergent in qk

now let us prove that if b is a quite small, nite vicinity of the point {qk

the other alternative is excluded by the above condition for b. to make this clear, one
should introduce such coordinates  in the qk-space that the boundary of the domain b
is determined by the equation 1 = a = const and then argue as above for the coordinates
 with   2.
 if tlie
integration in qk
+ is carried out within the sector under consideration. on pointing out
that the result, of internal integration in (a.1.2) does not depend on the bending, we add
the integrals over all sectors and conclude that (a.1.2) converges in {qk
} that
lies outside the sphere bl, then expression (a.1.2) is equal to zero. we consider the
momentum qi
 of one line. flowing along the diagram, it can ramify or it can merge
with other momenta. clearly, two situations are possible: either it ows away completely
through external lines, or, probably, after long wandering, part of it, q, makes a complete
loop. the former situation is possible only if |qi
|, where all external momenta
leaving the diagram (but not entering it) are summed. obviously, s can be chosen such
that for {qk
 > q
holds for all momenta of its lines and the positive direction of the momenta is along the
loop. then the integral over qk
+ of the loop in question can be interchanged with the
} (because it is absolutely and uniformly convergent for all qk
integrals over {qk
) and the

residue formula can be used to perform this integration. since, for the loop in question,
the momenta qi
 of the lines of this loop are separated from zero and are of the same
sign, the result is zero. this has a simple physical meaning.
if we pass to stationary
noncovariant perturbation theory, we nd that only quanta with positive q can exist.
in this case, external particles with positive p are incoming and those with negative p
are outgoing. then, the momentum conservation law favors the occurrence of the rst
situation.

} from b, a line exists whose momentum violates this condition.

the latter situation results in the existence of a loop, where the inequality qi

the entire outside space for b can be composed of the above domains bl (everything

converges well at innity due to the factor exp(pi qi
of (a.1.1), one can substitute the integration domain v  bl for v, set the limit in 
under the sign of integration over {qk

the limit in  under the integration sign because the domain of the integration over {qk

it is necessary to prove the correctness of the following three procedures: (i) setting

(iii) setting the limits in  and  under the signs of dierentiation with respect to y . in

i.e., a limit on the integrated function arises, and, thus, the limit in  can be put under
the integral sign. the situation is similar for case (ii). it is evident from (a.2.1) that the
function  can be singular only if the eigenvalues of matrix a become zero. on nding
the lower bound of these eigenvalues, one can prove through rather long reasoning that
bounds (a.2.2), (a.2.3) exist if condition (4.3) is satised.

after the limits in  and  are put under the integral sign, it is not dicult to
interchange them with the dierentiation with respect to y . one need do it only for
i > 0 (for each i) and, in this case, one can show that the eigenvalues of the matrix a
are nonzero and  is not singular.
