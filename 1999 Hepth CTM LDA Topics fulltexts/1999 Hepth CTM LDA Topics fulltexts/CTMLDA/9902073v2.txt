abstract

we discuss the gauge theory mechanisms which are responsible for
the causal structure of the dual supergravity. for d-brane probes we
show that the light cone structure and killing horizons of supergrav-
ity emerge dynamically. they are associated with the appearance of
new light degrees of freedom in the gauge theory, which we explicitly
identify. this provides a picture of physics at the horizon of a black
hole as seen by a d-brane probe.

1 introduction

given the conjectured dualities between supergravity and gauge theory [1, 2],
it is natural to ask how the causal structure of supergravity arises from gauge
theory. in particular we would like to understand  from the gauge theory
point of view  why objects in supergravity must move on trajectories that
stay within their future light-cones.

this question is non-trivial because supergravity generally lives in a space-
time with more dimensions than its gauge theory dual. the extra dimensions
of supergravity correspond to the moduli space of vacua of the gauge theory.
the moduli space carries a euclidean metric, with no a priori restriction on
how fast an object can travel on it. so some dynamical mechanism must be
present in the gauge theory to enforce causality for motion on the moduli
space. the question can be sharpened by turning on a temperature. this
modies the causal structure of the supergravity background, through the ap-
pearance of a black hole with a non-degenerate horizon. how is this change
in causal structure reected by the dynamics of nite-temperature sym?

we rst consider supergravity probes, such as dilaton wavepackets in
ads5, which map to objects that move on the base space of the gauge theory.
for such probes the supergravity causal structure arises from kinematics in
the sym: causality in supergravity is related to the causal structure on the
base space by the uv/ir correspondence. then we turn to d-brane probes,
made by breaking the gauge group to su(n) u(1). these probes move on
the moduli space of the gauge theory. we show that the restriction on their
velocities arises dynamically, through the appearance of a new light degree
of freedom in the gauge theory: a pair of w particles becomes light as the
velocity of a brane probe approaches the local speed of light. as a closely
related phenomenon, we also discuss the limiting electric eld on a d-brane
probe. finally, we turn to black holes, and show that an isolated w particle
becomes massless at the horizon. this makes contact with our previous
proposal [3], where we argued that a non-extremal horizon is detected by a
d-brane probe as the onset of a tachyon instability[4].

to support these claims we use the sym  supergravity correspondence
to indirectly calculate the mass of a w in sym, along the lines of the wilson
loop computations pioneered in [5, 6]. but in the nal section of this paper
we perform an explicit diagrammatic calculation of the mass of a w . the
diagrammatic calculation is valid at suciently high temperature (at the
edge of the region of correspondence with supergravity), and shows that at
least in this special region these claims follow directly from the sym itself.

2 supergravity probes of ads5 causality

we begin with supergravity probes of ads5  s5. this is a simple example
in which the light cone structure of the supergravity arises from kinematics
of the gauge theory. the metric and dilaton are

where d3 is a numerical constant and e2 = g2

the supergravity to be valid. consider an object build out of supergravity
elds, at rest on the s5, but with some velocity in the u direction. this
velocity must satisfy

(2)

in order that the object not move on a space-like trajectory.

how does such a restriction arise in the sym? the dual su(n) gauge
theory lives on the boundary of ads5 with coordinates (t, x||). a super-
gravity excitation at a radial coordinate u corresponds via holography to an
excitation in the sym with size [7, 8, 9, 10]

x|| =

(3)

as the supergravity probe moves in the u direction its size changes in the
sym. translating the supergravity condition (2) into gauge theory terms
using (3), one nds that causality in supergravity implies the restriction

but this is just the statement that in the gauge theory the size of an excita-
tion cant change faster than the speed of light. an equivalent observation
has been made by susskind [11], that the time for a supergravity excitation
to propagate directly across ads space is equal to the time for a sym excita-
tion to travel around the boundary of ads. other discussions of ads/cft
causality have been given in [12, 13, 14].

so for supergravity probes causal propagation arises as a consequence of

kinematics in the sym, via the uv/ir relationship (3).

3 d-brane probes of causality

we proceed to study the mechanisms which enforce causality on the motion
of a p-brane probe in the near-horizon geometry of an extremal black p-
brane. the dual theory is p + 1 dimensional sym in a certain range of
couplings [15], higgsed to su(n)  u(1). we will show that causality is
enforced dynamically, through the appearance of new light degrees of freedom
in the gauge theory at a limiting velocity. we also discuss the closely related
phenomenon of a limiting electric eld.

3.1 causality and the dbi action

to establish a framework for our subsequent discussion, we begin by exam-
ining the supergravity eective action for a p-brane probe. this is given by
the dbi action [16, 17, 18] together with chern-simons couplings [19, 20].

s = tpz eq det(g + b + f ) +z c  eb+f

(6)

the eects we will discuss correspond to the restriction that this action be
real, det(g + b + f ) < 0. we would like to understand how this bound arises
from sym dynamics.

we rst consider the case b + f = 0, where the restriction simplies to
det g < 0, the condition for the probe to travel inside its future lightcone.
the action for the probe is

in the dual sym one considers an su(n + 1) gauge theory broken to

(9)

this is somewhat surprising from the sym point of view, since the moduli
space does not carry a causal structure, and there is no a priori kinematical
restriction on how fast a probe can move.

we also consider the case of a brane at rest but with a u(1) electric eld
i present on its worldvolume. this is a closely related situation, since an
f0
electric eld maps to velocity under t-duality. from (6) one sees that there
is a maximal eld strength

xi (cid:16)f0

i(cid:17)2

< 1 .

(10)

we seek to understand the sym origin of these restrictions.

all these restrictions arise because the probe action has a born-infeld
term, which becomes singular when the velocity or electric eld gets too
large3.
in string theory, the born-infeld action is the eective action for
massless open strings.
it arises from integrating out massive open string
states at tree level. in general we expect a singularity of an eective action
to reect the fact that a new degree of freedom is becoming light. such a
phenomenon is well-known in the context of open string eective actions:
in at space, above a critical limiting value of the electric eld, an open
string with oppositely-charged ends develops a tachyon instability [21, 22].
intuitively, when the electric eld becomes larger than the string tension the
string is unstable and stretches indenitely.

2a higgs vev cant be time dependent in innite volume, so we should think of the

brane as compactied on a large torus.

3the eective action is nite but non-analytic when the limiting velocity is approached.
but making a legendre transform one sees that the hamiltonian diverges at criticality:
the vacuum energy of the sym blows up.

4

the born-infeld action is also expected to arise as the eective action of
sym at large n [23, 24, 25]. when written in terms of the t hooft coupling
e2 note that the supergravity result (7) is o(n). so it should come from a
sum of planar diagrams with the topology of a disk, where a w runs around
the boundary of the disk and is dressed by su(n) degrees of freedom that
ll in the interior. the fact that the resulting eective action is non-analytic
at a critical velocity or electric eld suggests that some degree of freedom
which was integrated out becomes light at the critical eld.

it is instructive to regard this non-analyticity as a breakdown of pertur-
bation theory. the sym eective action has a double expansion in v2/4
and g2
e = e2/3p [23]. the diagonal terms in this expansion are expected
to re-sum to give the dbi action (7). at weak coupling, where g2
e  1 and
a one-loop calculation is reliable, the perturbation series breaks down when
the velocity expansion diverges, at v2/4  1. this is understood as a failure
of the born-oppenheimer approximation: w pair creation becomes possible,
and gives an imaginary part to the eective action [26, 27, 28]. on the other
hand, at strong eective coupling g2
e  1, it is expected that the pertur-
ev2/4
bation series breaks down when the diagonal expansion parameter g2
becomes of order one: this is the point (9) at which the dbi action is singu-
lar. note that at strong coupling the diagonal expansion breaks down while
the velocity expansion is still good, since v2/4  1/g2

ef f  1.

as we will show in the next section, the state which becomes light as the
probe velocity or electric eld is increased is a pair of w s, neutral under the
su(n)u(1). the mass of an isolated w remains large; it is the interaction
between them that makes the pair light.

3.2 w masses at strong coupling

we want to argue that a w -pair becomes light as the velocity or electric eld
approaches criticality. this could in principle be studied directly in the sym
by summing planar diagrams. in section 5 we will carry out a diagrammatic
calculation, valid for suciently high temperatures, but for now we take an
indirect approach, and use the correspondence with supergravity to compute
the energy of a pair at strong coupling.

we do this by adopting methods introduced in [5, 6] to compute wilson
lines in large-n gauge theory. from the point of view of string theory, the
worldline of a w is the boundary of a string worldsheet which has been
attached to the probe d-brane. the action for the w worldline can be
computed by evaluating the worldsheet action for the corresponding string.
at large n and large eective coupling we can treat the worldsheet classically,

5

ignoring uctuations and string loop corrections.

we consider several instructive examples, which are soluble and serve to
illustrate the behavior we expect in more general situations. first we examine
a w pair in an electric eld on a brane at rest. this provides a guide to the
qualitative behavior a string worldsheet in the backgrounds of interest. then
we consider a w pair on a moving brane. for a particular family of brane
trajectories we can solve for the string worldsheet, and show that the pair
becomes massless exactly at criticality. finally we study an isolated w on a
brane moving along an arbitrary trajectory, and show that its mass remains
large even as the velocity is increased. although we explicitly treat the case
of an ads5 background, the same calculations can be done for any p-brane.

3.2.1 w pair in an electric eld

we seek the classical worldsheet of a fundamental string that starts and ends
on a d3-brane which is located at a xed position u = uf and has an electric
1 turned on in the x 1 direction. we look for a static solution to
eld e = f0
the equations of motion using the ansatz

x 0 = 
x 1 = l
u = u()

  <  < 
0    

this treatment is essentially identical to [5, 6]; the only new observation is
that by including an electric eld we can stabilize the static solution at a
nite value of uf .

the worldsheet action is nambu-goto plus a boundary term.4 evaluated

the boundary conditions are satised when u0 = e1/2uf . note that as we
increase the electric eld u0 approaches uf , so the string stays closer to the
3-brane. but at the same time by (12) the separation l between the two
w particles decreases. note that l goes to zero at the critical eld e = 1;
this may be an artifact of our static ansatz.

3.2.2 w pair at criticality

consider a brane moving along a trajectory u = (x 0), and make the
following ansatz for a string worldsheet.

x 0 = 
x 1 = l
u = ( )

this describes a segment of string lying entirely within the the brane world-
volume. the string equations of motion are satised provided the brane
trajectory obeys

5this is not physically possible in supergravity, of course, but we are only using this

solution to understand how the same bound arises in sym.

7

when this condition is obeyed the system is at criticality. note that the
length of the string in the x 1 direction l remains arbitrary. also note that
when the velocity of the brane equals the local speed of light the electric eld
necessary to stabilize the string endpoints vanishes.

evaluating the action for this conguration we nd

e .

when the boundary conditions (15) are satised the bulk and boundary
actions exactly cancel, showing that a w pair becomes massless at arbitrary
separation in a critical eld.

3.2.3 mass of an isolated w

as we have seen, a w pair becomes massless when the electric eld and
velocity become critical. this could occur in the gauge theory for two distinct
reasons: either the mass of an individual w particle goes to zero and the
interactions are small, or the mass of a single w remains nite but a large
interaction potential cancels the rest energy of the pair.

to decide between these possibilities we study a single w in isolation.
this is easiest in the velocity case, with vanishing electric eld. an isolated
w can be obtained from a w pair by sending the separation l   while
holding the velocity xed. as can be seen in the example of section 3.2.1, at
large l the worldsheet will tend to adopt a conguration in which the string
stretches from the brane close to the horizon at u = 0 and then travels along
the horizon before returning back out to the brane.6

this means that we can compute the mass of an isolated w by studying
the worldsheet of a string that stretches straight from the brane to the hori-
zon. such a solution is easy to obtain: for a brane moving on an arbitrary
trajectory u = (x 0) the string worldsheet is

x 0(, ) = 
1


u(, ) =

 ( )

6for an extremal background we expect the classical string worldsheet to change
smoothly as l increases, but at nite temperature the minimal-action worldsheet changes
discontinuously at a nite value of l [29, 30].

8

evaluating the nambu-goto action for this worldsheet one nds

s = 

1

2 z dx 0 (x 0) .

the w is at rest in the gauge theory, so we can directly read o its (time-
dependent) mass: mw = 1

2 .

note that mw is given in terms of the instantaneous higgs vev by the
usual formula, without any corrections involving the velocity. in particular
mw remains nite as the velocity of the brane approaches the speed of light.
this means that the phenomenon discussed above, of a w pair at some xed
separation becoming light at the critical velocity, must be understood as due
to a large interaction energy between the two w s, which cancels their rest
energy in the limit of critical velocity.

given that w pairs become light as the velocity or electric eld is in-
creased, it is natural to wonder if large amounts of pair production will take
place. we feel that pair production remains highly suppressed below criti-
cality, for reasons that are simplest to explain for electric elds. note that
although the energy of a w pair becomes small, the mass of an isolated w
remains large, so the pair is not completely free to separate in the electric
eld. indeed the static classical solution (11) suggests that as the electric
eld is increased the two w particles are forced to move closer together.
this reduces their dipole moment, which makes them very weakly coupled
to the electric eld. from the point of view of string theory, apart from the
fact that pair production is suppressed by gs  0, the w pair corresponds
to a neutral string, which further suppresses pair production [26]. so we do
not expect much pair production to take place as long as the eld is below
critical.

pair production should set in above the critical eld. for classical strings
this happens abruptly, as soon as the electric eld exceeds the critical value.
but it would be interesting to understand whether quantum eects can
smooth out the transition. this is an issue of 1/n corrections to the gauge
theory. the classical computations we have performed are only valid in the
strict n   limit. at nite n the su(n) degrees of freedom can uctuate,
and it seems reasonable that this corresponds to the light-cone uctuations
expected in quantum gravity.

4 d-brane probes of horizons

it is interesting to extend our discussion of causality to include nite tem-
perature eects. on the supergravity side, nite temperature modies the

9

causal structure of the spacetime, through the formation of a black hole with
a non-degenerate horizon. the presence of this horizon must somehow be
reected in the nite-temperature dynamics of sym.

to be more precise, we wish to address the following question. the dual
gauge theory selects a preferred set of coordinates for supergravity. the
time coordinate of the sym corresponds to a timelike killing vector of the
supergravity background.
in supergravity this killing vector can become
null, at so-called killing horizons. for example, this always happens at the
event horizon of a stationary black hole [31], and it also happens in ads5 at
u = 0 (which is not a true event horizon). what is the signature of a killing
horizon in the gauge theory?

to study this we place a d-brane probe at some higgs vev  in the gauge
theory. our proposal is that when the value of the higgs vev corresponds to
the position of a killing horizon, the mass of a w goes to zero in the gauge
theory. note that we are talking about a single isolated w particle, not the
w -pair discussed in the previous section.

this proposal originated in our earlier work [3], where we studied the
way in which a black hole absorbs and thermalizes a d-brane probe. we
argued that the w (mass)2 matrix has a zero eigenvalue when the higgs vev
takes the value  = 0 which corresponds to the position of the horizon.7
for non-extremal black holes we argued that there is a tachyon instability
for  < 0. the tachyon instability gives an imaginary part to the probe
eective potential, which causes absorption, and also makes it possible for
the probe to rapidly thermalize with the black hole. for extremal black holes
a w goes massless but no tachyon develops, and the absorption mechanism
is more plausibly string pair creation [3].

we rst consider the case of degenerate horizons (killing horizons with
zero surface gravity8). for example, consider the near-horizon geometry of
an extremal black p-brane (5). the timelike killing vector t becomes null
at u = 0. for a dp-brane probe this point indeed corresponds to the ori-
gin of moduli space, where the w s become massless. another example is a
d-string probe of an extremal d1-d5-momentum black hole [32, 33]. again
the timelike killing vector becomes null at the point which corresponds to
the origin of moduli space, where new massless particles appear. these ex-
tremal black holes are supersymmetric, so no tachyon instability can develop,
which means that the thermalization rate for infalling matter is very slow [3].
but this is consistent with the fact that these degenerate horizons have zero

7at nite n this is better thought of as the position of the stretched horizon (see the

discussion section).

8but possibly non-zero area

temperature.

let us now consider the non-degenerate killing horizons which arise for
non-extremal black branes. for simplicity we treat the near-horizon geometry
of a ten-dimensional 0-brane black hole, although the same discussion could
be given for any p-brane charge [15]. the string-frame metric and dilaton
are

where h(u) = 1  u 7

thus there is a limit on the radial velocity of the probe

the simple identication between the u coordinate of supergravity and
the higgs vev  of the gauge theory no longer holds when the black hole has

at extremality this reduces to the expected result  = u, and we see that an
extremal horizon indeed maps to the origin of moduli space. but away from
extremality the horizon corresponds to a non-zero higgs vev 0 = (u0)  u0.
note that the interior of the horizon u < u0 in supergravity corresponds to
imaginary higgs vevs in the gauge theory.

away from the horizon the physics of this bound is essentially the same as
in the previous section, with a w-pair becoming massless due to interactions
when the velocity approaches its limiting value.

but note that even for zero velocity the eective action (17) is singular at
the horizon, where h(u) vanishes.9 this non-analyticity signals the break-
down of the born-oppenheimer approximation. but unlike the situation in
section 3, the breakdown is now due to an isolated w becoming massless.
to show this, we proceed as in section 3.2.3, and calculate the mass of an
isolated w from the worldsheet action for an elementary string stretched
between the probe and the horizon. this is identical to the calculations per-
formed in [29, 30] in the context of nite-temperature wilson lines. for a
brane located at u = (x 0) this gives the w mass mw = (  u0) /2.
we see that a single w indeed becomes massless at the horizon. extrapola-
tion to  < u0 would give an imaginary mass, since u becomes a timelike
coordinate inside the horizon.

5 causality in m(atrix) theory

for non-conformal p-branes the supergravity background (5) is only valid for
a limited range of the radial coordinate [15]. in particular, for a system of
d0-branes, the description in terms of ten-dimensional supergravity breaks
down at short distances, and must be replaced by m-theory. we now briey
discuss causality in this regime.

a minor point is that m(atrix) theory [1] has a decoupled u(1) sector
describing center of mass motion.
sector the theory is free
and there is no limit on how rapidly a scalar eld can change. but this is
consistent with the fact that m(atrix) theory is a light-front description of
m-theory. in light front coordinates the requirement of causality10

in the c.m.

a restriction does arise, however, on the transverse relative velocity. this

where we have used rm 3 = 1/2 and r = (2)2g2
y m . this agrees
precisely with the bound (8) extracted from the ten dimensional supergravity
background.

this agreement isnt surprising, since the classical supergravity back-
grounds are so closely related. but it does suggest that w -pairs become
massless in the gauge theory at the critical velocity (22), even in the m(atrix)
theory regime.

6 direct calculation of the w mass

in this section we discuss the direct evaluation of the w mass for a system
of d0-branes at a particular temperature, and show that it agrees with the
supergravity result for a black hole of the same temperature. the supergrav-
ity is only valid up to black hole temperatures of order tc  e2/3, because at
this temperature the curvature at the horizon becomes of order one in string
units [15]. above tc the gauge theory is weakly coupled. therefore at t  tc
we should be able to qualitatively match perturbative sym calculations onto
supergravity calculations.

(23)

we work in the high temperature regime t > tc. at high temperatures the
gauge theory is weakly coupled, so the naive expectation is that the partition
function can be obtained from the tree-level spectrum of massless bosons and
fermions. this logic fails for the bosons, because higher loop corrections,
although suppressed by powers of the coupling, are in fact infrared divergent
due to the bosonic zero modes.11

these infrared divergences are cured through the generation of a thermal
mass for the bosons. to obtain the mass gap we must re-sum part of the
perturbation series. this can be done as follows. as we argue below, at high
temperatures the fermions make a negligible contribution to the mass gap.
so we temporarily ignore them, and approximate the bosonic sector of the
sym action (23) by the gaussian action

s0 =

l(cid:17) .

(24)

here l labels fourier modes in the euclidean time direction. to x the
parameters 2
l we make a large-n variational approximation [37]. this gives
a gap equation for the eective propagator

by scaling this equation one can show that the dimensionless eective propa-
l /e2/3, only depends on the dimensionless

l = n2

gator at large n, namely e2
eective temperature et = t /e2/3.

the second term on the right hand side of the gap equation is a ther-
mal mass for the bose elds. in fact this gap equation takes into account
all leading high-temperature corrections to the bose propagator. in writing
the gap equation we have ignored corrections to the propagator involving a
single fermion loop, as well as multiloop corrections. but the fermion loop
is negligible at high temperatures (it vanishes in the high temperature limit,
due to the antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions). and multi-

11at nite temperature the fermions are antiperiodic and do not have zero modes.

14

loop corrections to the propagator are small at high temperatures, where the
theory is weakly coupled.12

to solve the gap equation we introduce the size of the thermal state,

dened by the range of eigenvalues of the matrices x i.

the gap equation gives a consistency condition which determines rrms.

(26)

in this approximation the sym consists of 9n 2 bosonic harmonic oscillators
with frequency 4rrms, plus 8n 2 decoupled massless fermions, so the sym
free energy at high temperatures is given by13

fsy m  9n 2 log[2 sinh(2rrms)]  8n 2 log 2.

(27)

these are the standard results for perturbative sym in this temperature
regime.

the correct results in the low temperature regime t  e2/3 can be ex-
tracted from the dual supergravity background (16). one nds that the
horizon radius, energy and entropy are given by [15]

e2/3(cid:19)2/5
u0  e2/3(cid:18) t
esu gra  n 2e2/3(cid:18) t
e2/3(cid:19)14/5
ssu gra  n 2(cid:18) t
e2/3(cid:19)9/5

(29)

12once the thermal mass has been taken into account multiloop corrections truly are

suppressed at weak coupling.

13there are also ghosts associated with the choice of axial gauge a0 = 0, but their

contribution to the partition function is just det  = 1.

15

we see that the supergravity results for the energy and entropy agree with
the perturbative sym results (28) at t  e2/3. moreover, the higgs vev
0 at which a probe 0-brane develops a tachyon instability in the gaussian
ensemble (24) can be computed, and one nds that [3]

0(cid:16)t = e2/3(cid:17)  e2/3 .

(30)

this agrees with the supergravity result that u0|t =e2/3  e2/3. thus on the
edge of validity of the supergravity description one can apply a gaussian
approximation to the sym, and one nds that the horizon of the black hole
indeed coincides with the onset of a tachyon instability for a 0-brane probe.

directly analyzing the sym at low temperatures is a dicult problem.
but the bosonic sector of the gauge theory is easier to study: the gaussian
approximation (24), (25) is a good description of bosonic large-n yang-mills
quantum mechanics at any temperature.14 thus for the bosonic theory we
have

fbose = 9n 2 log[2 sinh(2rrms)]

and in the low temperature regime (t  e2/3)
e2/3

1
2

rrms 
ebose  9n 2e2/3
sbose  n 2(t )

(31)

where (0) = 0 and (e2/3) = 1. the energy is just the ground state energy
of the bosonic harmonic oscillators. notice that even at zero temperature
the ground state uctuations  rrms in the bosonic theory are very large.
in fact they extend out to the edge of the region  e2/3 in which (in the
supersymmetric case) supergravity is valid.

at temperatures below e2/3 the fermions in the sym are crucial for can-
celing the enormous ground state energy of the bosons which appears in (31).
while inclusion of the fermions will lower the ground state energy it cannot
signicantly alter < tr x 2 >, which continues to correspond to the size of the
entire region in which supergravity is valid. so generically all the interesting
supergravity physics, and in particular the horizon radius u0, lies deep inside
the region of the bosonic ground state uctuations [11, 38].

14one can calculate the leading corrections to the gaussian approximation for the

bosonic partition function and show that they are small.

7 conclusions and discussion

we have analyzed the emergence of causal structure in supergravity in view
of the sym  supergravity correspondence. we have shown that for d-
brane probes the supergravity restriction, that a probe travel slower than
the local speed of light, arises dynamically in the gauge theory, through the
appearance of a light composite state of two w s. the same phenomenon is
responsible for the limitation on electric eld. we have also conrmed that
a killing horizon in supergravity is associated with a w becoming massless,
and that with non-zero surface gravity the w may further become tachyonic.
it is amusing to see that whenever a d-brane probe tries to move on a lightlike
path, a massless mode appears in the sym. this gives a coherent and simple
picture of the origin of supergravity causal structure for d-brane probes.

we would like to comment on the picture of black hole physics that seems
to arise. it has been argued [39, 40] that there should be a unitary description
of black hole formation and evaporation from the point of view of an exter-
nal observer. for this to happen the semiclassical approximation to quantum
gravity (i.e. matter elds propagating on a xed background) should break
down near the black hole horizon even though the curvature there is small.
the black hole should have a stretched horizon, at a radius slightly larger
than the radius of the event horizon. hawking radiation emerges from the
stretched horizon which is endowed with the thermal properties of the black
hole. it can be shown [41] that the semiclassical approximation breaks down
if one uses spacetime foliations associated with outside observers.
in this
scheme the stretched horizon arises naturally as the locus of points where
the semiclassical approximation breaks down. it was also argued that the
description of physics as seen by observers falling into the black hole is com-
plementary to the description of the black hole as seen by the external ob-
servers.

in the supergravity  sym correspondence one identies the sym time
coordinate with the timelike killing coordinate outside the black hole horizon.
this means that the sym description of a black hole state corresponds to an
outside observers description of black hole physics. in classical supergravity,
corresponding to leading 1/n eects in the sym, the stretched horizon and
event horizon cannot be distinguished. this is the limit we have considered
in this paper. subleading corrections, however, do distinguish them. at
nite n the thermodynamic limit is replaced by statistical mechanics, and
uctuations can occur.
in particular the value of the tachyon instability
radius will uctuate. it seems natural to us to associate the outer limit of
the tachyon instability with the stretched horizon. this is why a probe will
thermalize at the stretched horizon, where the semiclassical approximation

17

breaks down. as the gauge theory develops a massless mode at the stretched
horizon, the ir/uv correspondence suggests that physics there is inuenced
by quantum gravity eects.

below the higgs vev corresponding to the stretched horizon, the gauge
theory has no space time interpretation. instead the probe has entered a re-
gion where the non-abelian degrees of freedom control the physics. thus for
the outside observer the region behind the stretched horizon has no spacetime
interpretation, unlike the situation for an infalling observer.
