a geometric approach to the standard model in terms of the cliord algebra c7 is advanced.
the gauge symmetries and charge assignments of the fundamental fermions are seen to arise from
a simple geometric model involving extra space-like dimensions. the bare coupling constants are

found to obey gs/g = 1 and g/g = p3/5, consistent with su (5) grand unication but without

invoking the notion of master groups. in constructing the lagrangian density terms, it is found that
the higgs isodoublet eld emerges in a natural manner. a matrix representation of c7 is included
as a computational aid.

i. introduction

in many physics equations of a fundamental nature, cliord (geometric) algebras [1] may be employed to recast
conventional expressions into more holistic and aesthetically pleasing forms. this approach often reveals insights
which were previously obscured by an inappropriate choice of architecture. the result may allow the consolidation
of incongruous terms, suggest missing pieces, or reveal new restrictions imposed by identifying privileged subspaces
within the chosen algebra.

the present paper explores the minimal standard model in terms of the cliord algebra c7. the aim here is to
demonstrate that the seemingly disparate gauge symmetries u (1)y  su (2)l  su (3)c may be unied under a single
simple geometric model. the implied formalism is then used to construct analogues of the conventional lagrangian
density terms.

in sec. ii the basic algebraic operations and conventions are laid out, as much of the notation used varies consider-
ably within the cliord algebra community. a brief recapitulation of the application of c3 to the description of at
space-time, as developed by baylis [2], is presented as the proper foundation for the addition of higher space-like di-
mensions. a matrix representation of c7 is oered in order to better elucidate the structure of the higher-dimensional
spinors used and to demonstrate the connection to the conventional dirac algebra. section iii details the gauge sym-
metries of the standard model as plane-rotational invariances of the c3 (physical) part of an extended current-density
expression involving all of the fermions of a single generation. the various group generators are worked out explicitly
for the specic spinor representation used. in sec. iv the gauge formalism developed is then applied to the construc-
tion of each of the various terms in the lagrangian density. the bare coupling constants then follow immediately
from the normalization of the double-sided set of generators. it is also shown that the minimal higgs eld [3] has a
natural origin, involving higher-dimensional components of the current.

ii. algebraic foundations

in the real cliord algebra c3, the vector elements {e1, e2, e3} are chosen to represent the three physical space-like

directions. the product of any number of vectors is completely determined by the anticommutator

{ej, ek} = 2jk.

(1)

the vectors can be reduced to linear combinations of

all higher-order products of
forms
{1; e1, e2, e3; e1e2, e2e3, e3e1; e1e2e3}. the three bivector forms and single trivector form are taken to represent planes
and the volume element respectively [4].
two basic real conjugations which are anti-automorphic involutions are frequently used in this paper. the reversion
of k  c3, denoted k , is obtained by reversing the order of appearance of all vector elements within k. for example,
(2)

the 8 basis

(e1e2e3) = e3e2e1 = e1e2e3.

1

both reversing the order and negating all vector elements of k denes cliord conjugation, denoted by k. for
example,

within c3, the latter operation serves to negate the vector and bivector portions while leaving the scalar and trivector
invariant. for both of these operations we clearly have

(e1e2) = (e2)(e1) = e1e2.

(3)

(ab) = b a,
(ab) = ba.

(4)

one type of structure that will be of central importance in this paper is that of projectorspairs of real idempotent

terms p satisfying

an example in c3 are the elements

 = p = p 
p 2
,
pp = 0,
p+ + p = 1.

p3 =

1
2

(1  e3).

(5)

(6)

in applying this formalism to relativistic physics, time may be allocated to the scalar part of a general real vector

v = v0 + vjej. the minkowski metric then arises naturally through the norm of v given by

the delimiters in eq. (7) will be used throughout this paper to designate the prevailing non-algebraic notation, outside
of which there is no metric implied in the summation convention for repeated indices.

one of the agreeable aspects of this formalism is that the lorentz transformations have a particularly lucid form.

proper and orthochronous lorentz transformations of vectors are represented by

v v = vv.

(7)

where l is any unimodular element: l l = 1, which can be expressed as the product [5]

v  lv l,

l = exp(/2) exp(/2),

(8)

(9)

where  = iei and  = iijkejek. pure rotations lr = exp(/2) are characterized by the unit plane of rotation
ijkejek/()1/2. similarly, pure boosts lb = exp(/2) are specied by the rapidity ( )1/2 directed along a unit
vector in the direction of the boost. the clear geometric interpretation of this method will be employed later when
the gauge transformations are introduced.

objects such as eq. (7) are clearly lorentz invariant scalars, since by eqs. (4) and (8) we have

v v  lv (l l) v l = lv v l = (l l)v v = v v .

(10)

one must be careful here to distinguish between invariant scalars and the time component of a four-vector, which
both occupy the same place in the algebra but transform dierently through eq. (8). the notation e0 will often
be used for the time component, with the understanding that it is algebraically just the identity element satisfying
e0 = e0. for example, a lorentz invariant trivector representing the full space-time volume element can be written as

e0e1e2e3  l(e0e1e2e3) l = e0e1e2e3.

(11)

again, we make no algebraic distinction between this and the trivector e1e2e3, leaving it to be implicitly understood
by the transformation rules which one is meant. in general, the same algebra will be used to construct a number of
dierent objects, which may be further classied by how they transform.

spinors may be dened as entities which transform according to the rule

  l.

2

(12)

under this prescription, spinors span all of the basis forms, but contain some projector structure on the opposite side
of the lorentz transformation operator. to illustrate this point in c3, consider the spinor

 = 2(0r + 1re1 + 1ie2e3 + 0ie1e2e3)p+3,

(13)

which has been contrived to transform under (12) in the same manner as the right-chiral1 portion of the conventional
weyl representation column spinor [6]. once  is explicitly dened in this manner, the projector structure is unaltered
by any lorentz transformation. conversely, multiplying any xed element onto  from the right will not aect the
lorentz transformations. writing a current vector as

we can see that the choice of projector in this case is not unique, since  may be multiplied on the right by a rotation
operator r, having the same form as lr. this leaves the current invariant by

 =  e,

(14)

and rotates the spatial vector in the projector through

  rr = r r = ,

(1 + e3)r = r(1 + re3r

).

(15)

(16)

one might be tempted to use this as the basis for some su(2) current symmetry, but instead we shall x the spatial
projector into a specic direction by dening the current as

j = p+3.

(17)

since p 
lorentz transformation of the light-like vector 1
the lorentz transformation of the current is then

+3 = p+3, we need now only consider the p+3 spinor forms. the current is then viewed as a sort of pre-
2 (e0 + e3), with the spinors acting as the transformation operation.

where the internal structure reects a choice in the form of the spinors and is treated as a lorentz invariant. the
form of eq. (17) still admits a geometric u(1) gauge symmetry, since an internal rotation of the projector about the
plane e1e2 yields

j  lp+3l = ljl,

(18)

+3 exp(3e1e2/2) = exp(i3/2)+3.

(19)

this seemingly innocuous restriction that the physical projector should remain gauge invariant will now be extended
to a higher-dimensional space, where a more elaborate projector structure on the spinors leads to an interesting
framework in which the complete gauge symmetry of the standard model arises in a natural manner.

a. higher dimensions

each extra spatial dimension beyond the three physical vectors {e1, e2, e3} is accommodated simply by introducing
a new ej in accordance with eq. (1). the commutation of any higher-dimensional (j > 3) vector with any element
k  c3 may be summarized by

ejk = k ej.

(20)

the denitions of reversal (k ) and cliord conjugation ( k) exemplied in eqs. (2) and (3) are extended to encompass
higher dimensions with no additional modications. as vector components, each of these extra dimensions is then
manifestly lorentz invariant. for example,

e4  le4l = l le4 = e4.

(21)

1to avoid confusion with later double-sided transformations, the term -chiral is preferred in place of -handed.

3

no further presumptions are made regarding the true nature of these additional dimensions, other than that they are,
in a sense, inaccessible directly in at space-time if lorentz transformations cannot betray their presence.

rotations in higher dimensions, which are key to the forthcoming discussion of gauge symmetries, are managed by
directly extending the form of eq. (9) to accommodate the exponentiation any element proportional to a unit bivector
in c7 representing the plane of rotation. since rotations in c3 leave all higher dimensions invariant, it is trivial to
map the same framework to any plane in c7 by symmetry. note that in euclidean spaces of dimensionality greater
than three, there are an innite number of planes orthogonal to a given direction. it is no longer sucient outside of
c3 to characterize a rotation by an axis.

the choice of adding four extra space-like dimensions {e4, e5, e6, e7} to form c7 is arrived at by simple counting
arguments. assuming four complex numbers (eight basis forms) for each fermion, one generation consisting of an
electron, a neutrino (assuming both left- and right-chiral), three up quarks and three down quarks, requires 64 basis
forms for the spinors. each additional dimension doubles the number of basis forms, so c7, with 128 basis forms, is
appropriate since only half of these will be used under the p+3 projection restriction.

c7 is also attractive in that the total volume element of the algebra

et  e1e2e3e4e5e6e7

(22)

commutes with all of the basis forms and squares to 1, and can therefore be identied with the unit imaginary. this
occurs for every c4n+3. if one were to settle for c6, for example, the full volume element of that algebra would
anticommute with all vectors, and one would be compelled to consider its inclusion as an additional dimension
regardless. this is also the case with the dirac algebra, since 5  i0123 anticommutes with all .

building upon the dirac algebra dened by

b. c7 matrix representation

{, } = 2g,
a faithful 8  8 matrix representation of c7 may be constructed by
ek (cid:18) 0k
0 0k (cid:19) ,
1 0(cid:19) ,
e6 (cid:18) 0 1

0 1(cid:19) ,
1 (cid:18) 1 0
0 0 (cid:19) ,

0

e4 (cid:18) 123
i 0(cid:19) .
e7 (cid:18) 0 i

0

0

123 (cid:19) ,

(23)

(24)

it is trivial to prove by contradiction that since the equivalent matrices satisfy the anticommutator (1), the matrix
representations of the 128 basis forms over the reals span all complex 8  8 matrices. the total volume element et is
equivalent to the diagonal matrix [i]88 and will be used interchangeably with the unit imaginary. for example, we
may write algebraically

e1e2e3 = ie4e5e6e7.

(25)

this aords a complex space which will be useful when comparing algebraic terms to those formulated in conventional
notation. note that of the 128 basis forms, only 1 and i have traceless matrix representations, therefore the complex
scalar portion of any algebraic term k  c7 may be extracted by calculating the trace 1
8 t r(m ) of its equivalent
matrix. embedding the dirac algebra in this manner supplants the need to introduce any explicit articial metric as
in eq. (23). this is advanced as the proper means to add extra space-like dimensions to the dirac algebra.

in developing the structure of spinors, the columns of an arbitrary complex 8  8 matrix are factored out in terms
of the c7 basis forms. this is directly analogous to representing spinors as column matrices in the conventional dirac
formalism, except now we may include several distinct fermion elds in the same term by using dierent columns for
each. it is illustrative to adopt a particular  matrix representation so that the columns may be factored explicitly.
the weyl representation is again chosen here because it yields a clear partition between the right- and left-chiral
spinor components in both the column and algebraic forms.

consider the top four complex elements of the rst column, which are equivalent to




0

  [(0 + 1e1)  (2  3e1)e5]p+3pp+.

this retains a core spinor structure similar to that of spinors in c3, multiplied by two new projectors which have
been abbreviated by

the bottom four components of the rst column translate as

0

  [(0 + 1e1)e5e6 + (2  3e1)e6]p+3pp+,

(27)

(28)

which has the same projector structure as the upper four components. the chiral designation has been interchanged
in accordance with the conjugation of the lower 0k submatrix in ek. each of the eight possible products p3pp
corresponds to a real diagonal matrix which projects out the column associated with each projector set. for example,

p1  p+3pp+  diag(1, 0, ..., 0).

(29)

anticipating that an su(2) doublet will arise from the degrees of freedom within a given column, and considering
the submatrix structure in (24), the upper and lower four components are ascribed to distinct fermions. transcribing
the remaining columns into algebraic form using the weyl representation, the four columns corresponding to p+3
projections are summarized in table i, where

r  (0 + 1e1)p+3,
l  (3  2e1)p+3,
and the factor of 8 has been inserted for later normalizations.
projector structure and are accessible through a dierent choice in eq. (30).
evidently, the chiral projector for all of the fermions in table i is given by

in general, other representations have a similar

(30)

pr/l =

1
2

(1  e4e5e6e7)

operating from the left-hand side. this is easily seen by monitoring the sign changes in the element

e4e5e6e7 = (ie4e5)(ie6e7)

(31)

(32)

as it both passes through the core spinor, where it commutes with any physical vector, anticommutes with any
higher-dimensional vector, and is then absorbed into the column projectors. the parity operator is given by

p :    = e1e2e3e4,

(33)

where  denotes the entire spinor set of table i. both the projector and operator also have clear matrix representations
through (24).

the projectors {p3, p, p} all satisfy p  = p and are mutually commuting [7]. consequently, in adopting eq.
(17) as the form for the particle current, the only surviving terms are those arising from within the same column. the
remaining columns {2, 3, 5, 8} have algebraic forms akin to those of table i, but are p3 projections and therefore do
not contribute. the total current obtained from simply adding the algebraic equivalents of all eight column-spinor
doublets into a single element  is then

j = p+3

=xp+3xu,l

j 

(i)e + (higher-dim. terms).

(34)

the sum here runs over the spinors assigned to the upper and lower portions of the p+3 columns. this is most easily
veried by computing the trace of the matrix representations of the algebriac products je. the eight currents of a
single generation of fermions are now incorporated into one expression. the residual part of the current involves cross-
current terms and mass-like terms of the form   between the upper and lower fermions of the same column, all

5

projected onto higher-dimensional elements. for the moment, we will be concerned with only the physical components
of the current, deferring the higher-dimensional results to a later discussion of the gauge coupling terms and higgs
eld in the lagrangian.

the above construction of the spinors can also be performed without any matrix representation scaolding. it is suf-
cient to specify that the spinor doublets should be minimal left-ideals of c7. however, the matrix representation will
prove a useful instructive device when making introductory comparisons with the conventional gauge transformations.

iii. gauge symmetries

the various gauge symmetries of the standard model will now be constructed by considering rotational transfor-
mations on the total spinor which leave the physical parts of the current in eq. (34) invariant. internal rotations are
transformations

from the right-hand side of the spinor that leave e3 invariant, since then

  r

j  rp+3r = j.

the space of available internal planes of rotation in c7 is spanned by the set of fteen bivector generators

ejek : (j, k)  {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}, j < k.
external rotations are comprised of the more limited set of transformations

  r

(35)

(36)

(37)

(38)

from the left of the spinor that leave the physical vectors of the current invariant. the external rotation generators
are spanned by the six planes

ejek : (j, k)  {4, 5, 6, 7}, j < k.

(39)

an additional restriction is made in that one of the spinors, namely the right-chiral neutrino, is to be exempt from
any such transformations. this will prove sucient to completely specify the conventional gauge structure of the
standard model.

we begin by arbitrarily assigning the lepton doublet to the rst column, with the neutrino and electron occupying
the upper and lower spinors respectively. the remaining three p+3 columns are likewise assigned to up and down
quark doublets. in excluding the right-chiral neutrino, the six external generators are reduced to three, since the
set may be regrouped into the three listed in table ii, which implicitly contain the left-chiral projector, while the
right-chiral partners are discarded. each generator characterizes a simultaneous independent rotation about two
commuting planes. these generators satisfy

with the antisymmetric structure constants f123 = 1. the conventional presence of the unit imaginary in front of t 
c
in eq. (40) has been absorbed into the properties of bivectors.

[t 

a, t 

b] = fabct 
c,

(40)

in the matrix representation (24), the generators t 

on the left-chiral portions of the spinors yielding

a are nonzero only for the central 4  4 submatrix. these act

t 
a  ia/2  122l,

where a are the standard pauli matrices. therefore, the eect of the transformation

on the total spinor is identical to that of the prevailing su (2) prescriptions

  exp(at

d(cid:19)l

(41)

(42)

(43)

in considering the broader set of internal transformations, it is useful to think in terms of shuing entire columns
about in the matrix representation, which is the only structural change a rotation solely from the right-hand side can
accomplish, aside from introducing phase factors. to remove the right-chiral neutrino from this process we insulate
the rst column by discarding any candidate generators t for which p1t 6= 0. this determines the surviving terms
t1 through t7 arranged in table iii. for example, p1t1 = 0 while p1(e4e6 + e5e7) 6= 0. this reduces the degrees of
freedom from fteen to eight, and the remaining plane e1e2 can then be tted into t8 under the same restriction to
complete an su (3) symmetry. these generators satisfy

where the antisymmetric structure constants are given by

[ta, tb] = fabctc,

f123 = 1,

f147 = f165 = f246 = f257 = f345 = f376 =

f458 = f678 =

,

(44)

(45)

note that a similar symmetry would have existed from the left-hand side, if it were not that the vectors e1 and e2 were
required to remain invariant as elements of the spatial current. the negative sign in eq. (44) has been introduced
simply to maintain consistent f123 constants shared by the two non-abelian symmetries while avoiding subsequent
sign disparities in the gauge-coupling lagrangian terms, which are an artifact of the double-sided transformations.

to verify that these generators induce the same eect as in the conventional arrangement, label columns 4, 6, and
7 as red, green and blue respectively, then transcribe the generators ta back into matrix form using (24). extracting
the 4  4 submatrix formed by the rows and columns 1, 4, 6 and 7 yields only a lower-right 3  3 submatrix i
a,
where a are the well-known gell-mann matrices. therefore, the transformation

leaves the rst column invariant and is identical in its eect on the remaining p+3 spinor components to

   exp(ata)

which is equivalent to the more familiar

(cid:0) r, g, b (cid:1) (cid:0) r, g, b (cid:1) exp(ia

a/2),




r
g
b


  exp(iaa/2)


r

 .

(46)

(47)

(48)

the dierence here is that the symmetry arises naturally from the geometric architecture and is not formed by
arbitrarily imposing an su (3) symmetry acting in some abstract space. of course, one may deduce the eects of
both of these sets of generators by dealing strictly with the algebraic elements and reach the same conclusions. it is
a useful exercise for some of the manipulations that will follow.

there remains one symmetry which has not been exploited as yet. we may consider a synchronized double-sided
rotation which has the eect of various phase transformations on the spinors and which conspires to cancel out in the
case of the right-chiral neutrino. the sole candidate for such an operation is

with the u (1) double-sided generators given by

  exp(0t 

0) exp(0t0),

0 = 1e4e5 + 2e6e7,

t 
t0 = 3e1e2 + 4e4e5 + 5e6e7,

where the k are real coecients satisfying

1  2 + 3 + 4  5 = 0.

(49)

(50)

(51)

the latter restriction follows directly from the projector structure of the right-chiral neutrino spinor. as this is to
represent a distinct symmetry, the left- and right-side generators must commute with all su (2) and su (3) generators
respectively. this imposes the additional constraints

7

the trivial solution may be normalized to

1 = 2,

t 

0 =

applying this operation to each spinor in turn proves to be identical to the conventional u (1)y transformation

(j)  exp(i0y(j))(j),

(52)

(53)

(54)

with the yj weak hypercharge assignments listed in table iv. this is most easily veried by examining the matrix
representation of the innitesimal transformation

   + 0t 

0 + 0t0

(55)

in order to derive the electromagnetic charges we must look for linear combinations of the generators {t 

for each of the p+3 columns. all of these weak hypercharge values now arise naturally from a single algebraic operator
which was derived from symmetry constraints, and there is no need to articially insert the charges for each particle.
0  t0, t

yielding assignments that are invariant under the parity transformation of eq. (33). note that the generators t3
and t8 have been excluded here since no linear combination has a uniform eect on the three quarks. since the
generators from the left must commute with the parity operator e1e2e3e4, the only possibility is to isolate the generator
e6e7 = (t 

0) on the left. the u (1)em symmetry is then specied by the generators

this is essentially the basis of the gell-mann-nishijima formula [8,9]

q = t3 +

y.

(57)

(58)

(59)

one may be tempted here to think that the restrictions in eq. (52) are simply a circuitous way of establishing the

same situation, since eq. (59) is contrived to satisfy the symmetry constraints

y (l) = y (el),
y (ul) = y (dl),
q(l) = q(r), q(ul) = q(ur),
q(el) = q(er), q(dl) = q(dr),

(60)

which completely determines the relative lepton assignments if y (r) = 0 is imposed. however, no analogy of the
latter restriction exists in the quark sector, as there are no such assumptions concerning y (ur). this leaves the quark
system indeterminate with an innite choice of possible charges under eq. (59). the solution in eq. (53) contains
additional structural information which is lost in the standard prescription and eectively derives the observed charge
assignments for the quarks. ultimately, this may be traced to the identication of the privileged subspace of bivectors
within the larger algebra, a choice which is unavailable in the conventional notation.

all of the above transformations may now be combined into a single expression

  exp(0t 

0 + 

at 

a) exp(0t0 + btb),

(61)

which exhausts the plane-rotational symmetries under the condition that the right-chiral neutrino is to be disengaged
from all gauge transformations.

iv. lagrangian terms

in this section, the preceding gauge formalism and overall strategy of consolidating terms will be applied to the
lagrangian density. the previous disregard for higher-dimensional products in the current will now be justied in
that the form chosen for the fermion terms extracts only select components of the current.

consider the algebraic form

e.

(62)

since the matrix representations for the vectors of c7 are hermitian, the matrix m associated with any general
element k  c7 satises the isomorphism

(m )t  k .

(63)

the term  may then be viewed as a stack of complex conjugate row spinors. as multiplication by e from the left
cannot mix the columns of , the diagonal of the matrix representation of (62) contains the contraction of each row
spinor with elements from its associated column spinor. from the representation of e in (24), it is then clear that

heis =xf

j (f )
 ,

(64)

where the s-bracket denotes the real scalar part. note that the sum includes the lower chiral-inverted spinor, since the
sign of 0k is reversed in the lower right 4 4 submatrix of ek. taking the real scalar part here, and with later terms,
is simply convenient shorthand notation for what could also be achieved by adding various symmetric counterparts
to the algebraic expressions.

it is sometimes convenient to invoke the algebraic equivalent of the square-matrix trace theorem

when dealing with the real scalar part. for example, we have

tr(ab) = tr(ba)

heis = heis,

(65)

(66)

which is then seen to be manifestly gauge invariant for physical vectors e since the physical part of the current 
remains invariant.

the algebraic spatial derivative is dened as

operating to the right. a unidirectional derivative is sucient since only the real scalar part is to be extracted,
symmetrizing the operation regardless. in analogy to the usual fermion derivative term in the lagrangian, we then
have

  0 + 1e1 + 2e2 + 3e3

(67)

l = hi is = xf

(f )i(f ).

(68)

it must be emphasized that although this expression appears similar to the conventional version, it contains all fermion
elds of one generation in a single algebraic term.

explicitly writing i = e0e1e2e3e4e5e6e7, the lagrangian component (68), for example, is then manifestly lorentz

it is sucient to verify invariance to rst order in  using the innitesimal transformation

(71)

(72)

note that t  = t for all generators, and all external t  commute with the physical gauge elds.
the usual charge currents are contained within eq. (71). for example,

rather than belabor the comparison of these terms with conventional expressions, it will simply be mentioned that

l1 = 

g
2 iy (f )bj (f )
 .

(73)

note that t0 by itself would be the singlet generator associated with the often ruminated ninth gluon, which has
now been absorbed into the denition of the weak hypercharge.

in constructing the free-eld expressions, the design here is to consolidate the internal and external transformations
into two separate terms. the physical part of the tensor associated with each generator tc occupies the six vectors
and bivectors of c3 and may written in the form

the full generator portion is handled through the contraction

fc = ( wc  wc)  g wawbfabc.

lf =

b{t

b} + fafb{ta, tb}is.

(74)

(75)

where a = 0 and b = 0 are now included in the sum, since t 
0 and t0 commute with all other generators on their
respective sides and also do not contract any scalar elements with them. the anticommutator in eq. (75) is evidently
necessary in the case of internal rotations since products such as t4t5 = 1
8 (e7e6 + e2e1) would otherwise introduce
spurious terms through the presence of a physical plane. this also ensures that under the gauge transformations of
eq. (70), which induce the transformation

the scalar part in (75) remains invariant since the only purely physical element contracted by the generators is then
the identity element.

the main reason for displaying the free-eld terms in this manner is to emphasize a key point concerning the eld

normalizations. the w and g elds may be entered into eq. (75) directly, since they share a common factor of

fa  fa + fabcbfc,

and are obliged to insert w0 = g0 =p3/20b in order to recover the conventional expression

(77)

(78)

(79)

at unication energies, where one would expect pure geometry to dominate, the gauge transformations of wa and
ga via eq. (70) should share a conjoint coupling constant relating the geometric rotation angle to the eld strengths.
it then follows immediately that the bare coupling constants obey

which results in a weinberg angle [10] of sin2 w = 3
8 . radiative corrections are assumed to lower the weak mixing
angle to the observed value of sin2 w  0.23 at accelerator energies. it has not been examined as yet what role the
extra space-like dimensions might play in such a renormalization procedure carried out within this framework.
conspicuously absent in the previous lagrangian terms are those projecting out the higher-dimensional mass-like
components of the current in eq. (34). it should be mentioned that these reside on the 8-dimensional lorentz-invariant
space {e4, e5}  p  {e6, e7}  p, and provide a natural inclusion of the higgs complex scalar isodoublet h and
anti-higgs eh through the identication

h = (1e6 + 2e7)p+  (3e5 + 4e4)p
3 + i4(cid:19),
 (cid:18)1 + i2
eh = (1e6 + 2e7)p  (3e5 + 4e4)p+
1  i2 (cid:19),
 (cid:18)3 + i4

in the expression

lm =

gf2h(h + eh)is.

(81)

(82)

these algebraic elements form a carrier space for the set of external gauge generators where, for example, the trans-
formation required for gauge invariance,

h  exp(0t 

0 + 

at 

a)h exp(0t 

0

b),

is equivalent to the conventional notation

(cid:18)+
0(cid:19)  exp(iy 0  iaa/2)(cid:18)+
0(cid:19).

(83)

(84)

the weak hypercharge assignment of y = 1 (y = 1) for the higgs particle (antiparticle) is recovered naturally
from the double-sided algebraic transformation. here again, the higgs eld is no longer an articial appendage cast
in some abstract space, but emerges readily from the geometry and is associated with the higher-dimensional vector
components of the current.

the form of eq. (82) is an illustrative example for equal fermion masses. distinct masses may be introduced through
weighted projectors on both sides of the spinor set . this particular area is not understood at present, but it is
encouraging that there seems to be additional structure to work with here.

for completeness, the remaining parts of the minimal higgs sector may also be written algebraically. the gauge-

invariant free-eld and potential terms respectively are

lh = h( h 
lv = hh 2 + h 4 + is,

0, h]  g wj[t

(85)

where eq. (20) provides for the minkowski contraction of the physical components. the gauge symmetry may broken
by choosing a vacuum expectation value

analogous to the conventional choice. this leads directly to the vector-boson mass relations of the weinberg-salam
model [10,11], the relevent initial term being

h0 = e5p,   2/,

v. conclusion

a common criticism on the application of cliord algebras is that, despite any alluring framework that may be
constructed, geometric approaches are merely reformulations of conventional expressions and are consequently devoid
of additional insights. in the present work, such an amelioration prompted the addition of extra space-like dimensions
and was essential in identifying the otherwise obscured geometric subspace in which the gauge symmetries abide.
these symmetries are no longer relegated to abstract spaces, but are seen to arise naturally from the architecture of
higher-dimensional spinors. as a consequence, the proposed unication of the elementary-particle forces follows from
purely geometric concerns.

note that the value of sin2 w = 3

8 at unication energies is identical to the often touted result from minimal su (5)
grand unication [12]. this is not surprising, as both originate from the normalization of the weak hypercharge oper-
ator. however, the contention here is distinctly dierent. in the geometric approach, the second symmetry-breaking
of the strong and electroweak forces arises naturally by invoking double-sided transformations. the introduction of a
master group such as su (5) to accomplish this adds extra gauge bosons and the hierarchy problem associated with
their experimental absence. furthermore, there is seldom any physical justication for a particular abstract master
group, other than its suiting a selection process under various constraints. this has been done here to some extent
in that the choice of c7 was to accommodate the number of observed fermions. however, the notion that higher
dimensions are directly responsible for the presence of gauge groups is more fundamental, as the physical basis for
those symmetries is apparent.

an obvious deciency of this model in its present form is the need to suppress the right-chiral neutrino. also lacking
is a geometric rationale for the inclusion of three generations of fermions and for some indication as to the origin of
their disjointed masses. work is continuing on these and other aspects of the standard model within this framework.

[4] within c3, the trivector element both commutes with all of the basis forms and squares to 1, and can therefore be
identied with the unit imaginary: j  e1e2e3. this reduces the eight-dimensional real space of the basis forms to a complex
four-dimensional space over the basis elements {1, e1, e2, e3}. for example, we may write eq. (13) as  = 2(0 +1e1)p+3.
this has been tactfully avoided here since the unit imaginary will be identied with the full volume element of c7. the
results of this work can also be derived using the c3 denition, but there is the added algebraic hazard that j does not
commute with higher-dimensional vectors. see, for example, w. e. baylis, j huschilt, and jiansu wei, am. j. phys. 60
(9), 788 (1992).

[6] there are various conventions for the weyl representation. to avoid confusion, the choice used throughout this work is

explicitly stated as

k

 0 =(cid:18) 0 1

0(cid:19) , k =(cid:18) 0
k

0 (cid:19) ,
l (cid:19) , g = (1, 1,1,1).
(cid:18) r

this is consistent with, for example, m. kaku, quantum field theory (oxford university press, new york, 1993).

[7] a similar primitive idempotent structure for particle doublets has been proposed for the algebra c1,6, but there are crucial
dierences both in the algebras themselves and in allotting time to the scalar component here. see, for example, j. s. r.
chisholm, and r. s. farwell, properties of cliord algebras for fundamental particles, in cliord (geometric) algebras,
