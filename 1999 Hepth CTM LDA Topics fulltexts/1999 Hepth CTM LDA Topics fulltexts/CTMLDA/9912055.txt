(ii) | h| h 2. case | + p| , universe inationary. naive holographic bound fails miserably, heb well. since case rcc parametrically equal |h|1, follows ceb works well heb. (iii) | h| h 2 i.e. || p. since p eective energy density pressure, problems causality. case occurs, instance, near turning point expanding universe recollapses result negative cosmological constant, positive spatial curvature (or both). naive heb apparent horizon bound (ahb) {$9902173$} fail here, boussos prescription ne. would like show ceb easily cope third case. consider either closed universe perfect uid thermal equilibrium constant equation state p = , 1 > > 1, additional small negative cosmological constant = . universe starts expanding, reaches maximal size, contracts towards singularity. case, matter entropy within comoving volume constant time, near point maximal expansion apparent horizon, hubble length, diverge, causing violation heb ahb. however, xed comoving volume, sceb a3r1 cc, and, since rcc never larger maximal value, 7 ceb chance better. see explicitly, note that, case, independently , r2 cc = 1/3max 1/2(1 + )0a3(1+), 0 initial energy density ratio scale

steins boussos. systems limited gravity whose size exceeds schwarzschild radius: r > rg, bekensteins bound given < sbeb = l2 p r rg, boussos pro- cedure results holography bound (2) {$9911002$}, < shol = l2 p r2, since r > rg, sbeb < shol, therefore boussos bound less stringent bekensteins. consider ceb applied region size r containing isolated system. expressing ceb form (3) one immediately obtains: sceb = l1 p r3/2e1/2h1/2 = (shol sbeb)1/2 , (11) implying sbeb sceb shol. conclude isolated systems limited self-gravity bekenstein bound tightest, followed ceb and, nally, boussos holographic bound. similar scal- ing properties heb discussed {$9907012$}. scaling laws also follow (apparently unrelated) quantum measurement arguments, see . regions space contain much energy corresponding gravitational radius rg exceeds r, bekensteins bound weakest, naive holography bound strongest (but often wrong). boussos proposal (see also {$9902173$}) uses apparent horizon rah ceb uses rcc. homogeneous cosmologies, rcc < rah, since r2 cc, according (7), always larger average two terms appearing r.h.s., precisely r2 ah = h 2 + /a2. since, xed volume, bounds scale like r1 ah r1 cc, immediately nd ceb generally generous ahb proposed 9 {$9902173$}. makes possible ceb fullled negative cosmological case discussed above, ahb heb violated. comparison boussos proposal subtle, since makes use ah area bound entropy light sheets. converted bound entropy space-like region inside ah special cases. makes boussos bound fullled even straight ahb fails. summarize, found that, systems strong gravity, sahb sheb sceb, sbousso sbeb , i.e., ceb boussos holographic bound strongest (yet apparently safe) bounds, bekensteins weakest. instead, naive holography bound comes badly: implied bekensteins case limited gravity, tight (and hence typically wrong) case strong gravity. boussos modication fares much better naive holographic bound. believe, however, ceb, applicable space- like regions, stands terms physical motivations potential practical uses. anticipate applications ceb study possibility black hole remnants carry enough entropy restore unitary evolution. ceb may converted new kind generalized second law following {$9907032$}, used study cosmological singularities. investigation possibilities left, however, future work. acknowledgments thank j. bekenstein, r. bousso, m.
