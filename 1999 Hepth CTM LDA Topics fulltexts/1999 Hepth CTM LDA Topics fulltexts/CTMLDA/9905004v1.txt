abstract

we analyze the coulomb branch of matrix string theory in the presence of ns5-

branes. if we regard the components of u (1) gauge elds as the dualized longitudinal
coordinates, we obtain the symmetric product of ads3  s3  r4 as the geometry
of coulomb branch. we observe that the absence or presence of the nonzero electric

ux determine whether the string propagates in bulk as an ordinary closed string or is

forced to live near the boundary.

we further discuss the issues of physical spectrum from the viewpoint of matrix

string theory. we show that the twisted sectors of cft on the symmetric orbifold,

which correspond to glued strings, turn out to yield many chiral primaries that were

hitherto considered to be missing. we also comment on the threshold energy in liou-

ville sector where continuous spectrum begins.

1 introduction

the theory of gravity or string theory on three-dimensional anti de-sitter space (ads3) is

one of the most interesting topics of late. this subject is known for a long time as the case

where the gravitational degree of freedom in bulk can be described by some conformal eld

theory on the boundary. after maldacena presented the celebrated conjecture on the duality

between the gravity on ads space and cft on its boundary[1], the case of ads3 achieves

particular interest, because we know cft in two dimensions much more than any other

dimensions. it may be possible to prove the maldacenas conjecture in more detail in the

case of ads3/cf t2. much works have been done along this line[2][13].

in string theory, ads3 space arises as the near-horizon geometry of the bound states of

d1/d5-branes, and usually we take its s-dual and consider the string theory on ns1/ns5-

brane background, in order to avoid the diculty to consider the string theories on rr

backgrounds. the duality between string theory on ads3 and certain boundary cft has

also been discussed extensively. the generators of boundary superconformal algebra were

directly constructed out of vertex operators on the worldsheet of superstring[2]. there are

attempts to compare the spectrum of chiral primaries and observe the correspondence to

some extent[5, 7].

there are further attempts to realize the ward identities of the boundary cft in terms

of string theory on ads3, in which another analysis of the boundary cft was given[6].

although there were some confusions between these two approaches, some recent works[11,

12] put these concepts in order. now it turns out that string theory on ads3 has two distinct

sectors corresponding to two dierent congurations of worldsheet. they are called as the

short string sector and the long string sector. the long strings are forced to live near

the boundary with some xed winding number, while the short strings can have arbitrary

congurations of worldsheet and are free to propagate in bulk. the two sectors lead to

two dierent explanations for the origin of the central charge of the boundary cft, as was

discussed in [12]. the main purpose of the present paper is to propose a unied framework

including both the short and long string sectors, based on matrix string theory[14].

one of the unresolved problems regarding the spectrum of chiral primaries is the mis-
match of its upper bound. in the string theory on ads space it is of order  k, where k

1

is the number of 5-branes. on the contrary, it is argued that the bound becomes of order
 pk in the boundary cft, where p is the number of 1-branes. as was stated in our pre-
vious paper[7], it is natural to think that this discrepancy is due to the fact that we are

only considering the theory of a single string in the bulk gravity side. so we expect that

the multi-string system based on matrix string theory may solve this inconsistency. in this

paper we show this is indeed the case.

this paper is organized as follows. we begin with the analysis of the coulomb branch of

matrix string theory in the presence of ns5-branes. we are then lead to the sigma model on

the moduli space of coulomb branch, which is identied as the second quantized string theory
on ads3  s3  r4. twisted sectors of this orbifold cft correspond to glued strings, which
are long strings made from some fundamental strings glued together.1 the long/short string

sectors are distinguished by the presence/absence of nonzero electric ux on the worldsheet.

we shall also discuss the spectrum of chiral primaries from the viewpoint of matrix

string theory, especially the issue of missing chiral primaries and the threshold for continuous

spectrum pointed out in [12].

throughout this paper we denote ns5-brane charge as k and ns1-brane charge as p,

following the convention of [2].

2 analysis of gauge theory

matrix string theory of type iia superstring[14] is dened as the large n limit of n = (8, 8)
u(n) sym theory in two dimensions. to incorporate k longitudinal ns5-branes extending

along 016789-directions, we add k hypermultiplets belonging to the fundamental represen-

and one adjoint plus k fundamental hypermultiplets.

tation of u(n).

group is generically broken down to u(1)n . the massless scalar elds parametrizing the

moduli space are n abelian vectormultiplets, which correspond to the string coordinates

1 hereafter we shall use the term glued string for strings which are made by gluing some fundamental

strings together. we will keep the term long string for dierent objects, which appear in [11, 12].

along the directions transverse to ns5-branes (2345 directions), and n neutral hypermul-

tiplets corresponding to the coordinates along 6789 directions. usually the 6789 directions

are compactied on t 4 or k3, by which the bound state of ns1-branes and ns5-branes are

viewed as a string in the remaining six dimensions. but in this article we would like to forget

about all the subtleties concerning the compactication of matrix string theory, focusing

mainly on the six-dimensional part.

one can obtain the exact metric of moduli space by one-loop analysis. this was done in

[15, 16] for the case of n = 1, and the calculation goes much the same in the case of generic

n.

in n = (2, 2) terminology, an abelian vector multiplet consists of a chiral and a twisted-
chiral multiplets, (, ). we can write down the most generic action for these multiplets as
an integral of a function k(, , , ) over superspace[17]. the condition for k to give a
n = (4, 4) supersymmetric gauge theory of vectormultiplets is given by

ki j + ki j = 0 , ki j  kj i = 0

the metric and b eld on the target space are given by

ds2 = ki j did j  ki j did j
b = 

1
4

(kij didj  ki j did j  k ij d idj + k i j d id j)

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

taking spin(4) symmetry and the permutation symmetry into account, we can conclude

that the most generic form for k is given by

ki

k = xi
ki = a(i i  i i) + b

(2.4)

ln i ln i z

i i d


ln(1 + )


terms with coecients a and b are tree and one-loop contributions, respectively, and we can
x them as a = 1

2g2 , b = k
4 .

we would like to note here that the one-loop contributions to the eective action arise

only from the fundamental hypermultiplets, so it is proportional to k. the one-loop contri-

bution of adjoint elds cancel each other, which is natural because the system has a larger

supersymmetry with 16 supercharges when the fundamental hypermultiplets are absent.

here, b is some open three-dimensional space whose boundary is the worldsheet of matrix
string. in the maldacenas near horizon limit or the weak coupling limit of iia superstring

theory, we send g2  g2
s to zero and drop the tree term from the action. then the metric
of the target space is no longer asymptotically at. the four-dimensional spatial directions
now have a tube metric, and it is expected that we obtain the ads3  s3 geometry by
incorporating the longitudinal directions. after rewriting the coordinates of s3 by the group

element of su(2) the action becomes

note that the level of the bosonic part of swzw in (2.7) should be shifted to k 2 by means
of the chiral rotation making the fermionic elds free. hence the level of the total current

including the fermionic contribution should remain k, as was discussed in [16, 18, 19].

3 short strings and long strings

various interesting phenomena occur when we compactify the spatial direction on s1. al-

though the gauge eld in two-dimension has no dynamics, it carries some topological infor-

mations, according to which we can classify the sectors of matrix string theory.

4

one such phenomenon is that there emerges various sectors which are labeled by the

periodicity conditions along s1. as was explained in the original papers on matrix string

theory[14], we can twist the periodicity of elds which take values in the cartan subgroup

of u(n) by elements of weyl group, namely, the n-th permutation group. the twisted

sectors are pictorially understood as glued strings, or some strings mutually glued into a

single string. for example, there is a sector which is labeled by the n-th cyclic permutation.

this sector is interpreted as the sector where n fundamental strings are joined together to

form a glued string. as we shall explain later, the glued strings constructed in this way are

accountable for the missing chiral primaries.

another interesting phenomenon is the presence of nonzero u(1) electric ux. in the at

background with no ns5-brane charge, this ux describes the existence of d0-branes[14],

and in the t-dualized framework it describes the (p, q)-string sectors[20, 21]. however, as

our discussion below is based on the eective action (2.7), the presence of electric ux may

have a dierent interpretation. we shall show below that the string becomes long if there

is nonzero electric ux on its worldsheet.

to simplify the problem, we focus on the case of a single string (the case n = 1) for the

time being. to see the implication of nonzero electric ux, let us write down the relevant

terms in the eective action below;

s = 

k

4 z

d2x (cid:18) +

1
2

e2f f(cid:19) + . . .

(3.1)

here the liouville eld  is dened as y = e and the worldsheet  is a cylinder or

the two-punctured sphere. we can quantize the system canonically, in the a0 = 0 gauge.

the only dynamical variable is the wilson line u = exp(cid:18)i a1 dx(cid:19), and (u)  u n is the
eigenfunction of the electric eld strength   e2e, which is the canonical conjugate of
the wilson line. note the eigenvalue is quantized due to the periodicity of the wilson line.

when there is nonzero electric ux, it yields the following contribution to the eective action

(here we move to the euclidean signature):

s  z

d2x e20n2 ,

n  z

(3.2)

to minimize the action, we must have 0   (or y = 0) conguration if there is nonzero
electric ux. on the contrary, 0 is arbitrary if there is no electric ux. hence we come to

5

the conclusion that the string is forced to live near the source ns5-branes if there is nonzero

electric ux on the worldsheet.

in the present situation, the ns5-branes are located at the origin y = 0. if we t-dualize
the system, the parametrization of the radial direction is reversed, namely, y = 0 and y = 
is interchanged.

we would like to see the correspondence between the eective action of matrix string
theory and the action of superstring on ads3  s3 in some detail. to do this, we shall rst
move to the euclidean worldsheet. as was obtained in the previous section, the eective

eld theory has the following liouville part

d2x(cid:18)  + e 2

k ff(cid:19)

s =

(3.3)
where  = 2k up to a constant shift. to ensure the conformal invariance, we must add
the improvement term

to the above action. the coecient q must be determined such that the term e 2

have the correct conformal dimension. then the eective action is given by

s =

this theory has the central charge

below we show that one must choose q dierently for long and short strings. the argument

is based on [22], and the observation of [12] that the cft on the short and long strings

describe respectively the coulomb branch and the higgs branch near the small instanton

singularity.

it is easy to see the correspondence of this cft and the world-sheet theory of short string

on ads3 background. the worldsheet action of a fundamental string on ads3 is given by

[2];

or equivalently, by introducing the auxiliary elds ,  we have;

(3.6)

(3.7)

the short string theory on ads3 is dened on an arbitrary compact riemann surface, because

it should describe arbitrary propagation and interaction of closed strings in bulk. (, )-

system should have the conformal dimensions (1, 0) as in wakimoto representation[23]. from

these facts we see the operator h 1 cannot take nonzero classical value. the rns
superstring action on ads3 background is obtained as the supersymmetric extension of the
above action. in quantizing the system, we can choose the light-cone gauge   z, + = 0
(+ is the fermionic coordinate along the longitudinal direction) of [8, 12] and eliminate

the longitudinal degrees of freedom. after this gauge xing, we nd that the cft of the

transversal degrees of freedom coincides with the one we have obtained from the gauge theory

analysis, including the improvement term of the liouville part.

here we make an important remark. the gauge condition   z is quite dierent from
the nonzero classical value of i 1. one must not confuse these two distinct notions. if

we impose the light-cone gauge condition on a string theory dened on a generic riemann

surface, we should impose it on each of the local coordinate patches. even in at background

the light-cone gauge cannot be imposed globally if we take a generic riemann surface as the

worldsheet.

2. long string (n 6= 0)

as we have seen above, in the case of n 6= 0 the worldsheet of the string is must be near
k e also indicates that the gauge
eld az and az should have the geometric dimension (1, 0) and (0, 1), and the operator

7

k

charge q = 2k s 2

k

 should have the conformal weight (1,1). this leads to the liouville background

. the central charge becomes now c = 6k.

this sector is identical to the cft on the long string in the light-cone gauge, which is

discussed in [8, 12]. as was discussed in these papers, we can bosonize the eight free fermions

in this theory to dene eight spin elds, which is fermions in the sense of worldsheet as well.
using these spin elds we can construct a n = (4, 4) superconformal algebra with c = 6k.
it is the sum of the two superconformal algebras arising from the r4 part and the remaining
part, with c = 6 and c = 6(k  1), respectively.

now we would like to compare our cft with the cft on the long string worldsheet.

recall that matrix string theory describes the iia strings and the (short or long) strings on
ads3  s3 are the objects in iib string theory. so to make a comparison we have to apply
t-duality to the two-dimensional eld theory.

let us start from iib side. the relevant part of the world-sheet action is given by

(3.6), and we rewrite  = 0 + i1. of course 0, 1 are the time and spatial coordinates

parameterizing the boundary of euclidean ads3. we can partially gauge-x the conformal
symmetry by the condition 0 = t, and obtain

s =

1

8 z

d2x(cid:26)  + e 2

k (cid:16)(t1)2 + (x1)2 + 2x1(cid:17)(cid:27) ,

(3.8)

we can t-dualize this action according to the standard procedure(see, for example, [24]),
with respect to the u(1) isometry 1  1 + 

s =

d2x(cid:26)  + e 2

k (cid:16)(t1)2 + (x1)2(cid:17) + 2it1(cid:27) ,

(3.9)

where 1 denotes the dual coordinate of 1.

on the other hand, our eective action of matrix string theory(3.3) can be rewritten, if

a suitable source term is added, as follows;

s =

=

1

8 z
8 z

1

d2x(cid:26)  + e 2

k (cid:16)(ta1)2 + (xa1)2(cid:17) + 2ita1(cid:27)

a1dx(cid:19)

(3.10)

where we have chosen a0 = 0 gauge, and added a gauge-xing term with respect to the

residual gauge symmetry. this action (3.10) is clearly the same as (3.9) if we make the
identication 1 = a1.

8

some comments are in order. first of all, long strings have nonzero winding number

hi 1di = 1, which implies that  should be of conformal dimension 1. this assignment

of conformal weight is consistent with the interpretation that  and a are dual to each

other. then it must be possible to put the classical value of  as  = z globally. hence long

strings must have cylindrical worldsheet, which is in contrast with short strings.

moreover, the term  2e 2

k x in (3.8) plays a role of the source term for the winding
number of , while the corresponding term  2ita1 in the dual action (3.10) is no other
than the source term for the electric eld   e 2
e. therefore we can say that nonzero

winding number of  in iib theory side precisely corresponds to nonzero electric ux in the

k

iia matrix string theory side.

in the above argument we can see explicitly, as stated previously, the interchange of y = 0
and y =  under t-duality transformation. hence a long string, which is forced to live near
y  0 in iia picture, is at y  + in iib picture.

all the argument given above was based on a proposal of [22] that we should assign

the canonical dimension 0 to the gauge eld a in the coulomb branch cft, while we

should assign the geometrical dimension 1 in the higgs branch. although originally we have

been analyzing the coulomb branch, the nonzero electric ux requires the redenition of the

conformal dimension of gauge eld, which then leads us to the physics of the higgs branch.

at the same time the object becomes a long string, whose dynamics suitably describes the

higgs branch cft near the small instanton singularity, as was discussed in [12].

4 twisted sectors

matrix string theory contains various sectors in which some fundamental strings are glued

together. the eld contents on the worldsheet of glued strings are the same as those of a

single string, so we can determine whether a glued string is long or short in the same way

as in the case of a single string. a generic sector of matrix string theory corresponds to a

set of glued strings, each of which has an arbitrary length. some of them are long, i.e. there

is nonzero electric ux on their worldsheet. the sum of the length of the long strings is the

ns1-brane charge p, which is xed. by the argument of the charge conservation, two strings

can be glued together only when there are equal electric ux on the two worldsheets[21]. in

9

particular, a long string and a short string cannot be glued together. then we are led to
the following conformal eld theory for this system: symn p(mshort) symp(mlong), where
mshort, mlong stand for the theories for a single short, long string given in the previous
section. here we mean by symn (m) the n-th symmetric product of a conformal eld
theory m. this operation is dened in a similar manner as the sigma model on a symmetric
orbifold mn /sn is dened from the sigma model on m.

matrix string theory contains various twisted sectors describing many glued strings. so

we expect that all of the connected and disconnected worldsheets having arbitrary genera

can be reproduced in the large n-limit. moreover, we further expect that the integration

over the moduli of the worldsheets corresponds precisely to the large n limit of matrix string

theory. this was conjectured in [14], and more detailed analyses were given in [25] based

on the interpretation of the bps instantons in matrix string theory as several plane curves.

although the analyses of [25] were done in the at background, this remarkable claim may

be true even in the presence of ns5-branes. in this way we might be able to recover the full
second quantized iib superstring theory on ads3  s3  r4 for the short string sector in
the large n-limit.

how about the long string sector? since the ns1-brane charge p is xed, we have at most

p-glued long string sector. this means that we cannot consider a worldsheet of a long string

with arbitrarily large genus (although we assume p >> 1). furthermore the moduli of the

worldsheet should be freezed, because the worldsheet of a long string must be cylindrical,

lying near the boundary of ads3 in the iib picture. therefore it is more appropriate to

regard the cft of the long string sector as the boundary cft itself, rather than the theory

of gravity or string theory in bulk ads3.

in our previous paper[7] we treated the rst quantized rns superstring on ads3  s3 
t 4 in the covariant formalism. we have constructed there a brst invariant state that

corresponds to the vacuum of the spacetime scft for the case of p = 1. as for p > 1 no

such state was found. this observation ts nicely with the results obtained in this paper.

we can see that if there were a single string carrying a winding charge greater than 1,

it would lead to an inconsistency. in fact, the assumption hi 1di = p or   zp implies
that (, ) have the conformal weights (p+1,p), hence we have to improve the stress tensor

10

as follows;

ttotal = tworldsheet + pj 3.

(4.1)

this stress tensor would give rise to the central charge c = 6kp2, if the worldsheet theory

were originally a critical string theory. hence this naive argument cannot explain the correct
central charge unless |p| = 1.

in addition, our previous arguments have shown that the shift in the conformal weight

of the gauge eld a due to the electric ux is always 1, no matter how large the ux is. in
the iib picture the conformal weight of  is always 1 when there is nonzero electric ux
in iia picture, regardless of how large it is. so the winding number of a single long string is

always 1.

so, the winding charge p > 1 must be carried by some glued long strings. they must

be composed of precisely p numbers of the single long strings, which leads to the cft of
symp(mlong) with the correct central charge c = 6kp. we believe that the matrix string
theory is the most natural framework to explain why such an orbifold cft arises.

5 spectrum in the long string sector

in this section we discuss the spectrum of chiral primaries in the long string sector. as was
given in the previous section, the cft of the long string sector is given by symp(mlong),
where mlong is the cft of a single long string. mlong is the product of a super liouville
theory with q = 2k s 2
, an swzw theory with level k and the superconformal sigma
model on m 4.2 the m 4 part and the remaining part have n = (4, 4) superconformal algebras
with the central charge c = 6 and c = 6(k  1), respectively. according to this product
structure, any chiral primary of mlong can be written as a product of a chiral primary of m 4

2 up to the previous section we thought that m 4 = r4. in this section we shall somehow generalize

k

the situation and consider m 4 as one of r4, t 4 or k3. of course, as we have mentioned previously, if we

consider the generalization for the choice of the internal manifold at the stage of matrix string theory, there

must arise the subtleties concerning on the compactication of matrix theory on higher-dimensional torus.

but we shall forget about all the diculties and simply replace r4 by t 4 or k3 in this section.

o(, l) = o ol,

(  h (m 4), l = 0, . . . , k  2).

(5.1)

here o is one of the chiral primaries of m 4 part. they are labeled by the cohomology
element  of m 4. ol is a chiral primary of the remaining part, which has the following
form[12, 26];

we are now interested in the single particle states, we only have to consider the zm-twisted

sector, or the sector of a single glued string of length m.

the superconformal algebra (sca) suitably acting on the hilbert space of zm-twisted

sector is constructed in the following manner (see for example [27]): first we make up the

n, ga

n , k 

n o of the glued string variables in the similar manner as that of the
sca nl
single long string mlong with c = 6k. second, we must mod out by zm-action, and get
the desired sca a with c = 6mk. more explicitly, we should dene the superconformal
generators (in the ramond sector) for the zm-twisted sector as follows3

in this expression for ln the second term of rhs corresponds to the contribution from the
schwarzian derivative of the covering map w = zm.

we can now present the complete spectrum of chiral primaries for the zm-twisted sector.

the ramond vacua in this sector should have the same spectrum of weight and r-charge as

those in the cft of a single long string;

l
0|, l; (m)i =

finally we translate the above relations in the ramond sector to those in ns sector by means
of the spectral ow. as a result, the chiral primaries in zm-twisted sector o(, l; (m)) have

according to whether m is even or odd. it is the main reason why we here work in the ramond sector and

make use of the spectral ow instead of dealing with the ns sector directly.

h = j =

q() + l + k(m  1)

(5.10)

(l = 0,   , k  2, m = 1,   , p)

in this way we can reproduce almost all the chiral primaries of single particle type that is

expected from the correspondence with the scft on sympk(m 4),except for the absence of

the following sequence of states;

h = j =

h = j =

(m = 1,   , p).

(5.11)

notice that the case m = 1 in (5.11) is no other than the rst missing state discussed in

[12]. in that work it was discussed that the absence of this state is related to the small-

instanton singularity of the moduli space of d1/d5-brane bound states. we nd its cousins

in the zm-twisted sectors m > 1 . although we still have the missing states in the framework

of matrix string theory, they are not too many. especially, the bound for the r-charge

, which would



make the counting of the chiral primaries above the threshold dicult. this result is based

on the study of liouville theory[28], in which it is claimed that we have two dierent types

of states in quantum liouville theory: one of them is a non-normalizable state which form a

discrete spectrum, and the other is a normalizable state which form a continuous spectrum.
the latter appears above the threshold 0 
liouville theory. here we shall show that the threshold value also becomes p-times larger
when we consider the cft of p long strings, symp(mlong).

, where q is the background charge of

it is easy to see this in the untwisted sector. we only have to nd the normalizable state
with the smallest conformal weight in this sector. obviously this state has the form |0ip,
where |0i is the normalizable state with the lowest energy in the single long string theory;

(5.12)

therefore the threshold for the untwisted sector is equal to 0

.

in order to calculate the threshold value for general twisted sectors we have to recall the

denition of the virasoro operator in the zm-twisted sector(5.7). then the threshold for the

zm-twisted sector becomes as;

(5.14)

we make one comment. it is known that the spectrum of chiral primaries in sympk(m 4)

sigma model agrees with that of supergravity, below the bound 
proved in the case of m 4 = k3 by analyzing the elliptic genus[29], and more recently in

. this claim is rst

has been proved in the case of m 4 = t 4 by analyzing the new susy index[30]. the

value of the upper bound is the same,

pk

. although apparently the origins of the bound

are dierent between the analyses of [29, 30] and ours, there might be some relationship
between the two. this is because supergravity on ads3  s3  m 4 background has only
the discrete spectrum, and so the emergence of continuous spectrum leads to a failure in the

correspondence between the description of supergravity and the boundary scft.

6 conclusions and discussions

in this paper we studied the multi-string system on ads3  s3  m 4 in the framework of
matrix string theory. among other things, we have successfully presented a unied frame-

work of the various short and long string sectors. although gauge eld in two dimensions

has no local physical degrees of freedom, it plays an extremely important role, namely, the

vev of electric eld on the worldsheet distinguishes the short and long string sectors.

now we would like to mention on some problems to be discussed in future works.

in section 3 we have shown the t-duality between the action of matrix string and the

action of string on ads3  s3, as far as their bosonic parts are concerned.
interesting to investigate further and see the full t-duality. of course, some fermions are

missing on the gauge-theory side (which would correspond to the superpartner of bosonic

sl(2, r) currents on the superstring theory.) perhaps this aspect will be better understood

when we come to a deeper understanding of the relation between the u(1) gauge symmetry

of matrix string theory and the reparametrization invariance of the superstring theory. to

this aim the formulation of matrix theory in a manifestly covariant manner may be useful.

some approaches to this subject were given in [31].

in section 5 we discussed the problem of the missing chiral primaries by the analysis of

the cft of p long strings. although we still have some states missing as was pointed out in

[12], the correspondence with the sympk(m 4) sigma model is not too bad. in particular,
by taking account of the various glued strings we have reproduced the bound 
precisely the same as is expected from the analysis of the sympk(m 4) sigma model.

which is

on the other hand, there seems to be a further subtlety regarding the spectrum of the

multi-particle chiral primaries, for our construction seems to yield the spectrum interpretable

as the cohomology of symp(symk(m 4)), not of sympk(m 4). in other words there should be

an u-duality transformation which change the value of k and p, preserving their product. at

present it is not clear whether our construction in the framework of matrix string theory has

this duality symmetry. in any case we will need further study to get a complete understanding

of this issue.

the problem of the threshold for continuous spectrum is also interesting. we have shown

that our analysis of the cft of p long strings yields p-times larger value for the threshold,

between the supergravity in bulk and the boundary scft fails. perhaps it may be interesting

the above threshold coincides with the energy at which the rst excited btz black hole (the

massless btz black-hole) appears.
