abstract

the second-order dierential equation describes harmonic oscillators, as well
as currents in lcr circuits. this allows us to study oscillator systems by
constructing electronic circuits. likewise, one set of closed commutation re-
lations can generate group representations applicable to dierent branches
of physics.
it is pointed out that polarization optics can be formulated in
terms of the six-parameter lorentz group. this allows us to construct opti-
cal instruments corresponding to the subgroups of the lorentz groups. it is
shown possible to produce combinations of optical lters that exhibit trans-
formations corresponding to wigner rotations and iwasawa decompositions,
which are manifestations of the internal space-time symmetries of massive
and massless particles.

i. introduction

in our earlier papers [1,2], we have formulated the jones vectors and stokes parameters
in terms of the two-by-two and four-by-four matrix representations of the six-parameter
lorentz group [3]. it was seen there that, to every two-by-two transformation matrix for the
jones vector, there is a corresponding four-by-four matrix for the stokes parameters. it was

found also that the stokes parameters are like the components of minkowskian four-vectors,
and two-component jones vectors are like two-component spinors in the relativistic world.
this enhances our capacity to approach polarization optics in terms of the kinematics of
special relativity.

indeed, we can now design specic experiments which will test some of the consequences
derivable from the principles of special relativity. the most widely known example is the
wigner rotation. this has been extensively discussed in the literature in connection with
the thomas eect [4], berrys phase [5,6], and squeezed states of light [7].

in our earlier papers, we discussed an optical lter which will exhibit the matrix form of

(cid:18) 1 u
1(cid:19)

0

(1.1)

applicable to two transverse components of the light wave, where u is a controllable param-
eter. when applied to a two-component system, this matrix performs a superposition in the
upper channel while leaving the low channel invariant. the question is whether it is possible
to produce optical lters with this property.

in ref. [1], we approached this problem in terms of the generators of the lorentz group.
it is very dicult, if not impossible, to manufacture optical devices performing the function
of group generators. in the case of optical lters, this means an innite number of layers of
zero thickness. in the present paper, we deal with the same problem from the experimental
point of view. we will present a specic design for optical lters performing this function.
we will of course present our case in terms of a combination of three lters of nite thickness.
in order to achieve this goal, we use the fact that polarization optics and special relativity
shares the same mathematics. this aspect was already noted in the literature for the case of
the wigner rotation [6]. the concept of the wigner rotation comes from the kinematics of
special relativity, in which two successive non-collinear lorentz boosts do not end up with
a boost. the result is a boost followed or preceded by a rotation. thus we can achieve a
rotation from three non-collinear boosts starting from a particle at rest. since each boost
corresponds to an attenuation lter, it requires three attenuation lters to achieve a wigner
rotation in polarization optics.

while the wigner rotation is based on lorentz transformations of massive particles, there
are similar transformations for massless particles. here, two non-collinear lorentz boosts do
not result in one boost. they become one boost preceded or followed by a transformation
which corresponds to a gauge transformation. in two-by-two formalism, the transformation
takes the form of eq.(1.1). we shall show in this paper that the lter possessing the prop-
erty of eq.(1.1) can be constructed from one rotation lter and one attenuation lter. in
mathematics, this type of decomposition is called the iwasawa decomposition [8,9].

while the primary purpose of this paper is to discuss lters and their combinations in po-
larization optics, we provide also concrete illustrative examples of wigners little group [10].
the little group is the maximal subgroup of the lorentz group whose transformations leave
the four-momentum of a given particle invariant, and has a long history [11]. the wigner
rotation and the iwasawa decomposition are transformations of the little groups for massive
and massless particles respectively. it is interesting to note that these transformations can
be also achieved in optics laboratories.

in sec. ii, we review the formalism for optical lters based on the lorentz group and
explain why lters are like lorentz transformations. it is shown in sec. iii, that a rotation

2

can be achieved by three non-collinear lorentz boosts. in sec. iv, we spell out in detail how
the iwasawa decomposition can be achieved from the combination of two optical lters.

ii. formulation of the problem

in studying polarized light propagating along the z direction, the traditional approach is
to consider the x and y components of the electric elds. their amplitude ratio and the phase
dierence determine the degree of polarization. thus, we can change the polarization either
by adjusting the amplitudes, by changing the relative phases, or both. for convenience,
we call the optical device which changes amplitudes an attenuator and the device which
changes the relative phase a phase shifter.

let us write these electric elds as

(cid:18) ex
ey (cid:19) = (cid:18) a exp {i(kz  t + 1)}

b exp {i(kz  t + 2)}(cid:19) .

(2.1)

where a and b are the amplitudes which are real and positive numbers, and 1 and 2 are
the phases of the x and y components respectively. this column matrix is called the jones
vector. in dealing with light waves, we have to realize that the intensity is the quantity we
measure. then there arises the question of coherence and time average. we are thus led to
consider the following parameters.

s11 = < e
s12 = < e

xex >,
xey >,

s22 =< e
s21 =< e

y ey >,
y ex > .

then, we are naturally invited to write down the two-by-two matrix:

c = (cid:18) < e

< e

xex > < e
xey > < e

y ex >
y ey >(cid:19) ,

(2.2)

(2.3)

where < e
matrix [12].

i ej > is the time average of e

i ej. the above form is called the coherency

it is sometimes more convenient to use the following combinations of parameters.

s0 = s11 + s22,
s1 = s11  s22,
s2 = s12 + s21,
s3 = i (s12  s21) .

(2.4)

these four parameters are called the stokes parameters in the literature [12].

we have shown in our earlier papers that the jones vectors and the stokes parameters
can be formulated in terms of the two-by-two spinor and four-by-four vector representations
of the lorentz group. this group theoretical formalism allows to discuss three dierent
sets of physical quantities using one mathematical device. in our earlier publications, we
used the concept of lie groups extensively and used their generators based on innitesimal
generators.

in this paper, we avoid the lie groups and work only with explicit transformation ma-

trices. for this purpose, we start with the following two matrices.

(2.5)

if the above matrices are applied to the minkowskian space of (ct, z, x, y), the matrix b
performs a lorentz boost:

while r leads to a rotation:

t = (cosh )t + (sinh )z,

z = (sinh )t + (cosh )z,

z = (cos )z  (sin )x,

x = (sin )z + (cos )x.

(2.6)

(2.7)

in our previous paper, we discussed in detail what these matrices do when they are applied
to the stokes four-vectors.

in the two-component spinor space, the above transformation matrices take the form

(cid:18) e/2

0

0

e/2 (cid:19) ,

(cid:18) cos(/2)  sin(/2)

cos(/2) (cid:19) .

sin(/2)

(2.8)

we discussed the eect of these matrices on the jones spinors in our earlier publications.

in this paper, we discuss some of nontrivial consequences derivable from the algebra
generated by these two sets of matrices. we shall study wigner rotations and iwasawa
decompositions. the wigner rotation has been discussed in optical science in connection
with berrys phase, but the iwasawa decomposition is a relatively new word in optics. we
would like to emphasize here that both the wigner rotation and iwasawa decomposition
come from the concept of subgroup of the lorentz groups whose transformations leave the
momentum of a given particle invariant.

iii. wigner rotations

there are many dierent versions of the wigner rotation in the literature. basically, this
rotation is a product of two non-collinear lorentz boosts. the result of these two boosts
is not a boost, but a boost preceded or followed by a rotation. this rotation is called the
wigner rotation.

in this paper, we approach the problem by using three boosts described in fig. 1. let

us start with a particle at rest, with its four momentum

4

fig. 1. closed lorentz boosts. initially, a massive particle is at rest with its four momentum
pa. the rst boost b1 brings pa to pb. the second boost b2 transforms pb to pc. the third
boost b3 brings pc back to pa. the particle is again at rest. the net eect is a rotation around
the axis perpendicular to the plane containing these three transformations. we may assume for
convenience that pb is along the z axis, and pc in the zx plane. the rotation is then made around
the y axis.

pa = (m, 0, 0, 0),

(3.1)

where we use the metric convention (ct, z, x, y). let us next boost this four-momentum
along the z direction using the matrix

b1 =

resulting in the four-momentum

pb = m(cosh , sinh , 0, 0).

(3.2)

(3.3)

let us rotate this vector around the y axis by an angle . then the resulting four-

momentum is

pc = m (cosh , (sinh ) cos , (sinh ) sin , 0) .

(3.4)

instead of this rotation, we propose to obtain this four-vector by boosting the four-
momentum of eq.(3.3). the boost matrix in this case is

the net result of these transformations is b3b2b1. this leaves the initial four-momentum

(3.10)

(3.11)

this matrix performs a rotation around the y axis and leaves the four-momentum of eq.(3.1)
invariant. this rotation is an element of wigners little group whose transformations leave
the four-momentum invariant. this is precisely the wigner rotation.

this relativistic eect manifests itself in atomic spectra as the thomas precession. oth-
erwise, the experiments on wigner rotation in special relativity is largely academic. on the
other hand, as was noted in the literature, this eect could be tested in optics laborato-
ries. as for the stokes parameters, the above four-by-four matrices are directly applicable.
indeed, each four-by-four matrix corresponds to one optical lter applicable to polarized
light.

in order to see this eect more clearly, let us use the jones matrix formalism. the

two-by-two squeeze matrix corresponding to the boost matrix b1 of eq.(3.2) is

6

s1 = (cid:18) e/2

0

0

e/2 (cid:19) .

(3.12)

the two-by-two squeeze matrix corresponding to the boost matrix of eq.(3.5) is now

s2 = (cid:18) cos(/2)  sin(/2)

cos(/2) (cid:19)(cid:18) e/2

sin(/2)

0

0

e/2 (cid:19)(cid:18) cos(/2)

 sin(/2)

sin(/2)

cos(/2)(cid:19) ,

(3.13)

where the parameters  and  are given in eq.(3.6). after the matrix multiplication, s2
becomes

s2 = (cid:18) cosh(/2)  sin(/2) sinh(/2)

cos(/2) sinh(/2)

cos(/2) sinh(/2)

cosh(/2) + sin(/2) sinh(/2)(cid:19) .

(3.14)

this is a matrix which squeezes along the direction which makes the angle ( + )/2 with
the z axis. the two-by-two squeeze matrix corresponding to b3 of eq.(3.8) is

s3 = (cid:18) cosh(/2)  cos  sinh(/2)

 sin  sinh(/2)

 sin  sinh(/2)

cosh(/2) + cos  sinh(/2)(cid:19) .

(3.15)

now the matrix multiplication s3s2s1 corresponds to the closure of the kinematical triangle
given in fig. 1. the result is

s3s2s1 = (cid:18) cos(/2)  sin(/2)

cos(/2) (cid:19) ,

sin(/2)

(3.16)

where  is given in eq.(3.11).

iv. iwasawa decompositions

in sec. iii, the lorentz kinematics was based on a massive particle at rest. if the particle
is massless, there are no lorentz frames in which the particle is at rest. thus, we start with
a massless particle whose momentum is in the z direction:

where k is the magnitude of the momentum. we can rotate this four-vector to

ka = (k, k, 0, 0),

kb = (k, k sin , k cos , 0)

by applying to ka the rotation matrix

r+ =




1
0
0 cos +  sin + 0

1

cos +

sin +

0

0

0

,




(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

with + =  + /2.

if we rotate kb around the y axis by 2, the resulting four-momentum will be

7

fig. 2. two rotations and one lorentz boost which preserve the four-momentum of a massless
particle invariant. the four-momentum ka is rotated to kb by r+. it is then boosted to kc by
the boost matrix b. the rotation matrix r brings back the four-momentum to ka. the initial
momentum is along the z direction, and the boost b is made also along the same direction. the
rotations are performed around the y axis.

kc = (k, k sin , k cos , 0).

it is possible to transform kb to kc by applying to kb the boost matrix

with

b =

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

we can transform kc to ka by rotating it around the y axis by (  /2). the rotation

matrix takes the form

this t matrix plays an important role in studying space-time symmetries of massless par-
ticles.
if this matrix is applied to the four-momentum ka given in eq. (4.1), the four-
momentum remains invariant. if this matrix is applied to the electromagnetic four-potential
for the plane wave propagating along the z direction with the frequency k, the result is a
gauge transformation.

again, the above four-by-four matrices are directly applicable to the stokes parameters.
on the other hand, if we are interested in designing optical lters, we need two-by-two
representations corresponding to the four-by-four matrices given so far. the two-by-two
squeeze matrix corresponding to the boost matrix b of eq.(4.5) is

s = (cid:18) e/2

0

0

e/2 (cid:19) ,

while the two-by-two matrices corresponding to r+ of eq.(4.3) and r of (4.7) are

r = (cid:18) cos(/2)  sin(/2)

cos(/2) (cid:19) ,

sin(/2)

(4.9)

(4.10)

where + and  are given in eq.(4.3) and eq.(4.7) respectively. they satisfy the equations

+ +  = 2,

+   = .

the relation between  and  given in eq.(4.6) can also be written as cosh(/2) = 1/ cos ,
which is more useful for carrying out the two-by-two matrix algebra.

the matrix multiplication rsr+ leads to

t = rsr+ = (cid:18) 1 2 tan 

(cid:19) .

0

conversely, we can write the

(cid:18) 1 2 tan 

0

1

(cid:19) = rsr+.

(4.11)

(4.12)

the t matrix can be decomposed into rotation and squeeze matrices. this possibility is
called the iwasawa decomposition. in the present case, t of eq.(4.11) can also be written
as

t = rs n(r)1 r1o r+
= nrs (r)1o (r1r+)

(4.13)

the matrix chain rs (r)1 is one squeeze matrix whose squeeze axis is rotated by /2,
and the matrix product r1r+ becomes one rotation matrix. the result is

t = s()r(2),

(4.14)

with

9

s() = (cid:18) cosh(/2) + cos  sinh(/2)

sin  sinh(/2)

sin  sinh(/2)

cosh(/2)  cos  sinh(/2)(cid:19) ,

r(2) = (cid:18) cos   sin 

cos  (cid:19) .

sin 

(4.15)

it is indeed gratifying to note that the t matrix can be decomposed into one rotation and
one squeeze matrix. the squeeze is made along the direction which makes an angle of /2
or (/2  )/2 with the z axis. the angle  is smaller than /2.

we have discussed in our earlier papers [1,2] optical lters with the property given in
eq.(4.11). we said there that the lters with this property can be produced from an innite
number of innitely thin lters. this argument was based on the theory of lie groups where
transformations are generated by innitesimal generators. this may be possible these days,
but the method presented in this paper is far more practical. we need only two lters [14].
we are able to achieve this improvement because we used here the analogy between po-
larization optics and lorentz transformations who share the same mathematical framework.

concluding remarks

in this paper, we noted rst that both the wigner rotation and the iwasawa decomposi-
tion come from wigners little group whose transformations leave the four-momentum of a
given particle invariant. since the lorentz group is applicable also to the jones vector and
the stokes parameters, it is possible to construct corresponding transformations in polariza-
tion optics. we have shown that both the wigner rotation and the iwasawa decomposition
can be realized in optics laboratories.

the matrix of eq.(1.1) performs a shear transformation when applied to a two-
dimensional object, and has a long history in physics and engineering. it also has a history
in mathematics. the fact that a shear can be decomposed into a squeeze and rotations is
known as the iwasawa decomposition [8].

among the many interesting applications of shear transformations, there is a special
class of squeezed states of photons or phonons having the symmetry of shear [13]. the
wave-packet spread can be formulated in terms of shear transformations [15].

as we can see from this paper, a set of shear transformations can be formulated as a
subset of lorentz transformations. this set plays an important role in understanding inter-
nal space-time symmetry of massless particles, such as gauge transformation and neutrino
polarizations [11,16,17].
