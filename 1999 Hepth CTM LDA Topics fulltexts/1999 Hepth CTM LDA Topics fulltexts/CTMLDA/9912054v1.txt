introduction

the apparently simplest model of space-time beyond minkowski space is de sitter

space.

its high (maximal) degree of symmetry makes it the typical framework to

investigate quantum eld theory outside at space.

one of the essential ingredients of quantum eld theory are the various green func-

tions of the elds. for the scalar eld on de sitter space, the rst work on the subject

is, in our knowledge, the paper of geheniau and schomblond [1]. these authors

have used the harmonicity property of de sitter space, i.e. the possibility to solve

klein-gordon equation by a function depending only on the geodesic distance, to

obtain the expression of the pauli-jordan propagator (x, y). soon after, cahen,

geheniau, gunther and schomblond [2] have obtained the expression of the analo-

gous green function s(x, y) for the spinorial eld. their method consisted essentially

to compute s(x, y) rst with y xed at the origin of a coordinate patch, and then,

to generalize the expression so obtained for an arbitrary couple of points by using

parallel transport. later, schomblond and one of the authors of this work (ph.s)

have obtained a fock space description of the scalar [3] , spinorial and vectorial [4]

propagators by computing them as mode sums. the main result in [3] was that by

imposing invariance conditions (with respect to the isometries of the space) and x-

ing the behaviour at short distances of the propagator, a uniqueness theorem holds.

all ambiguities about the denition of particles, expressed by arbitrary bogoljubovs

transformations, are resolved. at the same time, candelas and raine [5] obtained a

similar result using the harmonicity properties of the space to write a schwinger rep-

1

resentation of the feynman propagator depending only on the geodesic distance and

satisfying a regularity boundary condition (imposed on the kernel of the schwinger

representation).

let us emphasize that, for the massless scalar eld (2 = 0), it is impossible to ob-

tain a fully de sitter invariant vacuum state. this result was rst noticed by spindel

[6] and independently rediscovered in 1982 by vilenkin and ford [7].

it has been

discussed in details by allen and folacci [8, 9]. allen has also obtained explicitly

de sitter invariant representations for the green functions of the spinorial, vectorial

and gravitational elds [10, 11, 12], under the assumption a priori that these green

functions could be expressed in terms of products of functions of the geodesic distance

with maximally symmetric bispinors or bitensors.

a drawback of this geometrical construction of the green functions is that we have

no information about the existence of an underlying fock space, i.e. a vacuum state

such that expectations values of elds products with respect to it give the correspond-

ing green functions. actually, for the gravitational eld, the situation is the same

as for the massless spin 0 eld [1]: there exists de sitter invariant green functions,

but no corresponding vacuum state. representations of these green functions have

been obtained by allen and turyn [12, 13] and by antoniadis and mottola [14]. both

results, which dier only by gauge choice, are obtained as analytic continuation of

green functions built on the euclidean 4-sphere. a direct evaluation of the gravi-

tational propagator as mode sums in physical space (de sitter space) has been done

by tsamis and woodard [15]. their construction leads to a result analogous to the

one already obtained for the massless, minimally coupled scalar eld: there is no de

2

sitter invariant vacuum state for the massless spin 2 eld.

in this note, we shall perform the calculation of the propagator for the massive spin

2 eld. more precisely, we consider the gravitational perturbation eld equations

introduced by lichnerowicz [16], which corresponds to a mixture of spin 0 and spin

2 elds. in section 2, we summarize the eld equations and remind the mode sums

representations of the various propagators.

in the third section, we specialize the

eld equations on (3+1) de sitter space and solve them explicitly on a half de sitter

space. we then obtain the propagators by summing modes. in section 4, we establish

coordinate-free and manifestly o(4, 1) invariant representations of the propagator. in

section 5,we discuss quickly the analytic continuation of the modes and propagators

on the full de sitter space.

ii metric perturbation on einstein space

following lichnerowicz [16], we write the equations of motion for massive metric

perturbations on an einstein background space (r = g) as

r(h) = h

(1)

where r (h) denotes the terms linear in the components of the tensor h in the

expansion of the ricci tensor evaluated on the metric g = g + h. the factor  on the
right hand side of eq.(1) is related to a mass term as m 2 = 2(). this denition of
mass is meaningful because m 2 = 0 corresponds to pure gravity. hereafter, we shall

denote by m

r2 = 2 the eigenvalues of the quadratic casimir operator i1 considered

3

by borner and durr [17] who have used the notations m2 = 2 and m0 = i (see
eq.(47)).

from the bianchi identities, written for the metric g, we deduce that solutions of

eq.(1) satisfy automatically the de donder conditions:

(  )h = 0

.

(2)

in these equations, as in the rest of this paper, we have introduced the einsteinian
conjugate tensor h = h  1
civitta connection built on the metric g which is used to lower and raise the indices.

, and the covariant derivatives refer to the levi-

2gh

consequently, eq.(1) is equivalent to the system constituted by eq.(2) and

2h + 2rh  2(  )h = 0

.

a particular solution of eqs (2,3) is given by:

h =  + (  )g

when  satises the scalar eld equation :

2 + 2 = 0 .

this scalar eld is proportional to the trace:

h
 = (4  6)

,

and describes the spin 0 content of h, which is a mixture of spins 0 and 2.

equation (1) can be derived from the lagrangian :

+ggg + ggg  ggg) 
+gg  gg) 

1
2hh q, 


2


2

hh (gg

hhp,

(7)

which is unique, up to trivial transformations (rescaling and addition of divergences).

from it we deduce the expression of a conserved current, a sesquilinear form on the

space of complex solutions of eq.(1):

j(h, k) = i(hk  kh)q,

and, by integration on a cauchy surface , a symplectic structure:

h  k = z

dj(h, k) = (k  h) = (k  h).

(8)

(9)

if {ah} is a complete set of positive frequency modes, labelled by the index a, and
satisfying the relations

ah b h = ab
ah b h = ab
ah b h = 0 = ah  bh

(10)

we may obtain as mode sums the usual green functions of the quantum eld h

associated to the classical eld h. the pauli-jordan propagator (x, y), dened by

the commutator [h(x), h(y)], is given by:

(x, y) = ixa

ah(x)ah(y) a h(x)ah(y)

,

(11)

5

while the symmetric (often called hadamard) propagator 1(x, y), dened as the
vacuum expectation value of the anti-commutator h{h(x), h(y)}i, is:

1(x, y) = xa

ah(x)ah(y) +a h(x)ah(y)

,

(12)

and the feynman propagator f (x, y):

f (x, y) =

1
2

[1(x, y) + i(x, y)(x, y)] ,

(13)

where (x, y) = 1 according as the point x is in future or the past of y.

iii field equations on de sitter space

the four dimensional de sitter space h 4 can be seen as the homogeneous coset space

o(4,1)/o(3,1), i.e as the sphere of equation:

abx ax b = r2

(a, b = 0, ..., 4)

(14)

imbedded in a ve dimensional (at) minkowski space m 5. using the parametriza-

tion:

 =

r2

x 4  x 0

,

xi =

rx i

x 4  x 0

(i = 1, 2, 3)

(15)

the metric induced on h 4 reads as

g =

r2

2  d2 +xi

(dxi)2! .

6

(16)

de sitter space-time is a space of constant curvature: r = 

3 (gg  gg),
the relation between the cosmological constant  and the radius r of the space being:

 = 3/r2 .

on de sitter space eq.(3) becomes equivalent to

2 h +(cid:18)8

3

  2(cid:19) h 

2
3

gh

 = 0 .

(17)

hereafter we shall in a rst step restrict ourselves to the chart  > 0, which covers

only one half of the full de sitter space. it is the domain corresponding to the causal

past of a physical observer (region o on g.1).

to solve the system of equations (17) we have found useful to use the rescaled quan-

tities introduced in [15]:

k =

2
r2 h

and to pass to the fourier transformed variables :

k(, ~p) =

1

(2)3/2 z d3p ei~p.~xk(, ~x) .

where ~p.~x = pi pixi.

7

(18)

(19)

moreover it is natural to express these fourier components in a local frame adapted

to the vector ~p. to this aim, we introduce the four vectors u()(~p) whose components

with respect to the natural coordinate frame (, xi) are:

u
(0) = (1, 0, 0, 0)

u
(3) = (0, pi/p)

u
(1,2) = (0, i

,

p = sxi
(1,2)), with xi

pii

(pi)2

(20)

(1,2) = 0 .

they satisfy the orthogonality relations

gu

()(~p)u

()(~p) =

r2
2 

.

(21)

we shall also make use of the projector on the spacelike directions orthogonal to ~p:

2

 =

2

r2 (cid:16)u(0)u

(3)(cid:17)
(0)  u(3)u
(2)(cid:17)
(1) + u(2)u

r2 (cid:16)u(1)u

.

=

(22)

once expressed in this frame, the components of (19) split into longitudinal and

transverse parts :

k l = u

(3)k0 =

pi

k0i

,

,

conversely, the components of (19) with respect to the natural frame read

k0i = ui

(3)k l + k 
i

,

kij = ui

(3)uj

(3)k ll + ui

(3)k l

in terms of these variables eq.(2) splits into:

summing the appropriate equations (35, 38, 40) we recover with the help of eqs (31,

32, 33) the trace equation (5) written in terms of its fourier transformed variable:

k 

2


k +(cid:18)p2 +

m

2(cid:19) k = 0

.

(41)

the general solution of this equation is given by a combination of hankel functions

(see [18]):

with

k(, ~p) = (p)3/2ha(~p)h(1)

0 (p) + b(~p)h(2)

0 (p)i

(42)

and

 (p) = ei 
h(1)

2 h (1)

 (p) = [h(2)

 (p)] ,

(43)

(44)

where h (1)

 , h (2)


are the usual hankel functions dened in [18].

from eqs (4, 5) and eq.(35) we obtain (assuming m + 4 6= n(n + 1), n  z, see
comment after eq.(66) ):

k00 = q 

2

3(m + 4) (cid:18) 3



k  (p2

2 )k(cid:19)

where q is the general solution of the homogeneous part (k = 0) of eq.(35):

q = (p)7/2hc(~p)h(1)

 (p) + d(~p) h(2)

 (p)i

and here

 = i sm +

15
4

.

11

(45)

(46)

(47)

from these solutions and eq.(31) we obtain algebraically the k l component:

k l = i

p " q 

4


q +

2p2

3(m + 4) (cid:18) k +

k(cid:19)# .

(48)

in the same way eq.(32) gives immediately

k ll =

)q(cid:21) 

2

3(m + 4) (cid:20) 1



k  (p2 +

m + 3

2

)k(cid:21) .

(49)

the equation (37) is decoupled from the others. its general solution is :

k 

j = (p)5/2hcj(~p)h(1)

 (p) + dj(~p)h(2)

 (p)i .

(50)

where cj(~p) and dj(~p) are 3-vectors orthogonal to ~p and  is again given by eq.(47).

this leads directly, thanks to eq.(33), to

k l
j = 

i

p (cid:18) k 
j 

4


k 

j (cid:19) .

(51)

finally it remains to solve eq.(40) for k 

jl

. the general solution of the homogenous

part is still given by a combination of hankel functions of the same index  (see

eq.(47)):

12

q

jl = (p)3/2hcjl(~p) h(1)

 (p) + djl(~p) h(2)

 (p)i ,

(52)

while a particular solution can be expressed in terms of q and k, leading to the

general solution:

k 

jl = q

jl  jl "

1

3(m + 4) (cid:16) k  (3 + m)k(cid:17) +

1

2p22 (2 q + (m  4)q)# (53)

the integration constants cjl (and similarly djl) can be expressed with the help of the

projector (22) as:

cjl(~p) = xm,n

(jmln 

1
2 jlmn)emn(~p)

(54)

where emn(~p) is arbitrary. this form insures that cjl is transverse to ~p and traceless
in order to verify eq.(30).

to be complete we have still to check that the longitudinal components (48, 49,

51), obtained from the divergence equations, are really solutions of the second order

equations (36, 38 and 39). they are!

now we may write a complete set of modes, solutions of eqs (2,17) as:

h(, ~x, ~p) =

ei~p.~x

(2)3/2

r2
2 k(, ~p) .

(55)

13

however instead of considering their natural components it is more useful to split

the modes according to their spin contents.

indeed, such a decomposition leads

automatically to orthogonal modes and it will just remain to normalize them. so we

shall write the general complex solution of the eld equations as

h(, ~x) = xi z d3p[ai(~p)hi

(, ~x, ~p) + b+

i (~p)hi

(, ~x, ~p)]

(56)

where the index i runs over six values corresponding to the spin 0 and spin 2 content

of the eld (see appendix for the explicit form of the modes).

if we assume that the amplitudes ai(~p), bi(~p) are operators obeying usual canonical

commutation relations:

[ai(~p), a
hbi (~p), b

i (~p )] = ii (~p  ~p )
i (~p )i = ii (~p  ~p )

[ai(~p), ai (~p )] = [bi (~p), bi (~p )] = [ai(~p), bi(~p )] = ... = 0 ,

(57)

the modes hi

 have to be normalized to 3(~p  ~p).

anticipating on the discussion of section v, we impose now that all modes depends
only on h(2) functions, with their various d coecients equal to 1. this choice is
it results from the requirements
compatible with the commutation relations (57).

that 10) the green functions are de sitter invariant 20) they have the same short

14

distance behaviour as in at space. the coecients of normalization of the modes

with respect to the scalar product (9) are displayed in the appendix. inserting these

modes in the general expression of the green functions (13) we obtain

the occurrence of the factor sec() in eqs(64,65) implies that the special values
of  = n + 1
, i.e. m + 4 = n(n + 1) need a special analysis. these values of the
2
index of the modes correspond to eigenvalues of the laplace-beltrami operator on the
4-sphere s4, i.e. situations where the analytic continuation of the propagators built
on s4 onto de sitter space fails [14]. in these cases it doesnt exist de sitter invariant
states; the invariant propagators describe expectations values of the eld with respect
to a density matrix.

iv invariant representation of the green functions

the (, ~x) coordinates (15) cover only one half of de sitter space corresponding to the
causal past of a physical observer (region o on g.1). this domain is bounded by a
future event horizon (x 0 = x 4 in eq.(15)) and is invariant under a seven parameter
subgroup of the full de sitter group o (4, 1). this group is isomorphic to r+
0  e(3),
as it is obvious from the writing (16) of the metric. it consists of the e(3) euclidean

motions preserving pi(dxi)2 in eq.(16) and the dilatations  7 k, ~x 7 k~x.
on this domain we may express the green functions in terms of obviously geomet-
rically invariant quantities. let us consider two points (p, q) belonging to o and
denote by x a and y a (a = 0, ..., 4) their coordinates in the embedding m 5 space.
the tangent vectors at the ends of the unique geodesic in o joining them are:

ya  pxa
t a
r|p2  1|1/2 ,
p =
q = x a + py a
t a
r|p2  1|1/2

,

where:

p =

abx ay b

r2

x.y
r2 =



2
p + 2

q  (~xp  ~xq)2

the components v a

p parallely transported from p to q are

v a
q = v a

v.tq
tq.tq

tq

(67)

(68)

(69)

and v a

q = v a

p when the geodesic is a null one (tp .tp = 0 = tq.tq)

we deduce immediately from this the expression the m 5 components of the tensor of
parallel transport from p to q :

a

b = a

b 

x axb + y ayb + x axb  py ayb

r2(p + 1)

(73)

using the previous expressions of the components of tp , tq and  and expliciting
the action of the derivatives in eqs (58) to (63) we obtain by identication invariant
expressions of the green functions. the details of the calculations are very tedious
and we dont reproduce them here. to illustrate the method, we shall consider only
the case of the massive vector eld. it has been demonstrated in [6] that the (, )
component (in the coordinates system (15) ) of the feynman propagator, dened by
the equation (g 2  r  m 2g)f   = 0 is given by:
 (p)#

m 2 (~x  ~y)"(

(x, y) =

f

with:

19

(75)

the others components are given by similar expressions (dierential operators acting
on invariant functions of p, see [6]). on the other hand, the most general maxi-
mally symmetric invariant bitensor with the same index structure as the vectorial
propagator reads as the combination:



f (p) + t 

p tqg(p)

so, the vectorial invariant feynman propagator f 

 can be written as:

f 

 = 

(p) + t 

p tq(p)

(76)

(77)

for some functions (p), (p). equation (74) can be reexpressed as a function of p

and  = 
 :

f 

(x, y) =

(78)

thanks to eq.(68). comparing this expression with the (, ) component of eq.(77), in
which the terms are grouped together according to their powers of , we may identify
the coecients (p) and (p) of the decomposition:

(p) =

and possibly use the other components of the propagator to check the results. they
are in agreement with those given in [10].

a similar calculation involving only two types of components: 00,0i and 00,i,j 

allows to determine the invariant form of the propagator:

v scalar green function revisited

in ref [3] we have shown that the greens functions of the scalar eld equation on the
domain o :

(2  m 2)    2

r2 (2

 + ~2) +

2
r

  m 2!  = 0

(87)

can be written as a superpositions of modes expressed in terms of hankel functions :

u~p() =


2r

0 = ism2r2 

9
4

3/2hc(~p)h(1)

0 (p) + d(~p)h(2)

0 (p)i ei~p.~x

(88)

with |d(~p)|2  |c(~p)|2 = 1,
and c(~p)d(~p)  c(~p)d(~p) = 0 , the last conditions
resulting from the normalisation condition u~p  u~p = 3(~p  ~p) . these conditions
are not sucient to x the vacuum (the positive frequency modes). if we impose the
vacuum to be invariant with respect to the 7-parameter isometry group of o, extra
(necessary) conditions appear. the coecients c(~p) and d(~p) have to be constant.
the resulting green functions still depend on three parameters. denite values of
these parameters are obtained by imposing that the short distance singularities of the
feynman propagator are the same as in at space:

lim
1

2f () = 1

22 , where

p = cosh(


r

)

then one obtains:

c = 0 ,

d = 1 ,

(89)

(90)

because the phase of d becomes irrelevant. the feynman propagator for m 6= 0, is
given by:

f (x, y) =

1

16r2

(m 2r2  2)

cos 0

f (cid:18)3

2

+ 0,

3
2  0; 2;

1 + p

2  i(cid:19) .

(91)

22

while for m = 0 one obtains [3] :

f (x, y) =

1

+ cte#
42r2 " 1
4r2 (  )((p  1) + (p  1))


1  p  ln(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)



r2 (p  1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

i

(92)

which is only e(3) invariant. we plan to discuss the physical signicance of this
choice of modes in a forthcoming publication [19].

up to now, all the expressions of the modes that we have considered where dened
only on o. if we extend the denition of  and ~x by eq.(15) on the full de sitter
space (excepted on the horizon h, i.e. the 3-surface x4 = x0) we may analytically
continue the modes by considering the behaviour of a wave packet near h. typically,
such wave packet behaves as:

(, ~x) = z

f (~p)d3p

4 ei(p~p~x)f (~p)d3p

(93)

the kircho (poisson) formula giving the solution of the massless scalar wave equa-
tion in at space insures that this expression remains nite on the horizon, despite the
presence of the divergent factor ||. the continuation of the modes across the horizon
is obtained by looking in the region  < 0 which combination of hankel functions
have an asymptotic expansion that matches with the one used in eq.(93). this leads
us immediately to an expression of the modes valid on the full de sitter space:

u~p() =


2r ||3/2[()h(2)

v0 ((  i)p)  i()h(1)

v0 ((  i)p)]

ei~p.~x
(2)

3

2

.

(94)

inserting this expressions of modes in integrals like those considered in eqs (64, 65),
we conclude that the expression (91) is valif on whole de sitter space, with p still
given by eq.(68) whatever are the signs of  and 

note that the region o = h 4 \ o is isometric to o but with time running in the
opposite way. this is in accord with the fact that it is precisely the hankel function
h(1)(|p|) which is coupled to h(2)(|p|), these two functions being of opposite fre-
quences on both o and o. finally, note also that by the continuation r 7 i r we
obtain invariant expressions of green functions on anti-de sitter space.
