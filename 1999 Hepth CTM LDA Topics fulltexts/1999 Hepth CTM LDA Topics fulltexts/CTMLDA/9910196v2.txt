abstract

we study the structure of the monopole conguration in u(2) non-commutative
super yang-mills theory. our analysis consists of two steps: solving the bps
equation and then the eigenvalue equation in the non-commutative space. cal-
culation to the rst non-trivial order in the non-commutativity parameter  shows
that the monopole exhibits a certain non-locality. this structure is precisely the
one expected from the recent predictions by the brane-conguration technique.

1 introduction

the fertile developments in string theory in this half a decade have enabled us to understand
various perturbative and non-perturbative phenomena in eld theories by geometrical intu-
itive pictures. this progress in string theory is now beyond the province of reproduction of
the result of the eld theories, that is, now the string theory has predictive power in various
eld theories.

one of the most intriguing examples is the 1/4 bps dyon solution in 4-dimensional
n = 4 super yang-mills theory (sym). the study of the 1/4 bps states in sym was
triggered by the discovery of the stable string network in type iib string theory [1, 2]. when
this string network has its ends on d3-branes, these states preserve 1/4 supersymmetries
of the original d3-brane worldvolume theory [3]. after the study from the string theory
side, there appeared some works [4, 5, 6, 7] in which explicit eld theoretical solutions for
the corresponding solitons were constructed. the properties of the solution favor the string
theory interpretation with respect to their (p, q)-charges, masses and supersymmetries.

recent topics of the string-theoretical realization of eld theories are concerning the space
non-commutativity [8, 9, 10]. the non-commutative super yang-mills theory (ncsym) is
realized as a decoupling limit of the worldvolume theory on d3-branes in the non-trivial
ns-ns 2-form background. taking advantage of this equivalence, some basic properties of
localized objects in this exotic eld theory were analyzed [11]. the brane congurations
corresponding to the monopoles, dyons and 1/4 bps dyons were constructed, and they
were shown to have the same masses and supersymmetry properties as the ordinary sym
counterparts. one fascinating prediction from this brane technique is that the monopole in
the ncsym has non-locality  due to the tilt of the d-string suspended between two d3-
branes (see g. 1). believing that the brane conguration of this gure precisely captures
the eld theoretical properties, the conguration of the monopole in the ncsym should
reproduce the tilted line, as the eigenvalues of the higgs eld. the ends of the d-string
appear to be magnetic charges, hence the eld theoretical solution should contain dipole
structure.

in this paper, we explicitly solve the bps equation for the monopole of the ncsym to the
rst non-trivial order in ij which species the non-commutativity. this 1/2 bps solution
has the same mass as the ordinary sym monopole, in agreement with the prediction by
string theory. solving the non-commutative eigenvalue equation in sec. 3, we show in sec.
4 that the solution actually reproduces the tilt of the suspended d-string. examining the
magnetic eld, the dipole structure is also found. in the nal section, we summarize the
paper and give some discussions.

2 non-commutative bps equation and its solution

the bogomolnyi-prasad-sommereld (bps) monopole solution [12, 13] of the ordinary sym
is saturating a particular energy bound which is usually called the bps bound. since this
bound is topologically sensible, the state saturating the bound is stable. now in the case of
the ncsym, unfortunately the topological argument seems not to be valid due to the high
complexity of the -product. even with this complexity, we can argue a similar mass bound
as in the following [11].

the energy of the system without the electric eld is given by

e = trz d3x(cid:20) 1

2

fij  fij + di  di(cid:21) ,

where we have dened the eld strength and the covariant derivative as

fij  iaj  jai  iai  aj + iaj  ai,

di  i  iai   + i  ai.

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

we have put the yang-mills coupling constant gym equal to unity. the -product is dened
with the non-commutativity parameter ij by

(f  g)(x)  f (x) exp(cid:18) i

2

ij

where {f, g} is the poisson bracket,


i



j(cid:19) g(x) = f (x)g(x) +

i

{f, g}(x) + o(2),

(2.4)

{f, g}(x)  ijif (x) jg(x).

(2.5)

we shall take as the gauge group the simplest one u(2). note that the group su(2) is
not allowed here since the algebra of any special unitary group is not closed when the
multiplication is dened by the -product. the energy (2.1) is bounded below by a surface
integral as follows:

e =

trz d3xhijk (fij  dk + dk  fij) + (fij  ijkdk)  (fij  ijldl)i

1
2

 trz d3xkhijk (fij  )i.

(2.6)

(2.7)

if the solution of the non-commutative bps (ncbps) equation,

di +

1
2

ijkfjk = 0,

has the same asymptotic behavior as the ordinary bps solution, then the energy remains
the same. this fact will be conrmed to the rst non-trivial order in  by explicitly solving
the ncbps equation (2.7).

we shall solve the ncbps equation (2.7) to o() in the small  expansion. let us express

the gauge eld as

ai  (aa

i + aa
i )

1
2

a +(cid:16)a0

i + a0

i(cid:17) 1

2

 ,

(2.8)

where the upper (lower) case component elds are of o(0) (o(1)). the scalar  is expressed
in a similar manner. first, the o(0) part of the ncbps equation (2.7) is nothing but the
ordinary bps equation, and we adopt the well-known bps monopole solution as the o(0)
part of the solution:

a =

xa

f (r), aa

i = aij

w (r), 0 = a0

i = 0,

where the the functions appearing in the solution are

(2.9)

(2.10)

the dimensionful parameter c determines the mass scale of the monopole. for later conve-
nience, we present the asymptotic behavior of these functions:

f (r) = c 

1
r

+ o(ecr),

w (r) =

1
r

+ o(ecr).

(2.11)

next let us proceed to the o() part of the ncbps equation (2.7). plugging (2.8) into

the ncbps equation (2.7) and taking the o() part, the u(1) component reads

i0 +

k}(cid:19) = 0,

and does not contain the su(2) elds (aa
i , a). on the other hand, the su(2) component
of the o() part of the ncbps equation decouples from the u(1) elds, and is in fact the
linearized equation for the uctuation (aa
i , a) obtained from the ordinary bps equation.
i , a) corresponds to a -dependent gauge transformation on the
since any solution for (aa
bps solution (2.9), we take aa

i = a = 0 hereafter.

now our task is to solve the equation (2.12). the ansatz for the bps monopole solution
(2.9) was the covariance under the rotation of the diagonal so(3) subgroup of so(3)gauge 
so(3)space.
in order to solve eq. (2.12), we put the following ansatz for the u(1) elds
i , 0) respecting the covariance under the generalized rotation, in which we rotate also the
(a0
parameter ij:

a0
i = ijxja(r),

0 = ijijkxkb(r),

(2.13)

where a(r) and b(r) are functions of r to be determined. putting these ansatz (2.13) and
the explicit forms of the bps solution (2.9) into the dierential equation (2.12), we obtain
the following two equations as the coecients of dierent tensor structures:

a + b + rb +

a + 2b 

1
4r2 w (w + 2f ) = 0,
4r2 w (w + 2f )(cid:21) = 0.

d

dr (cid:20) 1

the solution to eqs. (2.14) and (2.15) is given by

a(r) =

1
4r2 w (w + 2f )  2

c1
r3 + c2,

b(r) =

c1
r3 + c2,

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

with two arbitrary constant parameters, c1 and c2. the parts in (2.16) containing these
constant parameters are actually solution to the homogeneous part of eq. (2.12):

i0 + ijkja0

k = 0.

(2.17)

since the c2 part of the scalar 0 diverges at the innity, we put c2 = 0. as for the c1 part,
a careful substitution into the left hand side of eq. (2.17) gives in fact a term proportional
to ii(1/r) = 43(r). hence the c1 part is not a solution at the origin, and we shall also
put c1 = 0. finally the desired solution of the equation (2.12) is

a0
i = ijxj

1
4r2 w (w + 2f ),

0 = 0.

(2.18)

note in particular that the scalar eld receives no correction to this order. since the whole
solution has the same leading asymptotic behavior as the bps solution (2.9), we nd that
the non-commutativity does not change the mass of the monopole.

the generalized rotational covariance for a0

i allows two other terms with dierent structures, ijkjk and

xijkljkxl. however, eq. (2.12) implies the vanishing of these two terms.

3 non-commutative eigenvalue equation

the conguration of the d-string suspended between two parallel d3-branes is described
by the deformation of the surface of the d3-branes in the spirit of the bion (born-infeld
soliton) physics [14, 15]. the extent of this deformation of the d3-brane surface is given by
the eigenvalues of the scalar eld on the d3-branes. we saw in the previous section that
there is no additional contribution of o() in the scalar eld conguration. however, since
we are now dealing with the theory with the -product, the eigenvalue problem should be
dierent from that in the usual commutative case.
in this section, we see that the o()
terms are actually generated in the eigenvalues of the scalar eld.

we propose that the eigenvalue equation for a matrix valued function m to be considered

in the non-commutative case is

m  v =   v,

(3.1)

where v and  are the eigenvector and the eigenvalue, respectively. though there are other
candidates for the non-commutative eigenvalue equation, the present one (3.1) has advan-
tages over the others in various respects as we shall see in this and the nal sections.

for solving (3.1) to o(), let us make the expansion

m = m0 + m1,

v = v0 + v1,

 = 0 + 1,

where the subscript number species the order of . then the o() part of (3.1) reads

m0v1 + m1v0 +

{m0, v0} = 0v1 + 1v0 +

{0, v0}.

(3.3)

multiplying v

(3.4)

in view of the application to the present ncbps solution, let us consider the particular case
with

m0 = m0(r)bxaa

(bxi  xi/r),

m1 = 0,

and hence 0 = m0(r) and bxaav0 = v0. then, eq. (3.4) is calculated to give

with i  (1/2)ijkjk. note that 1 (3.6) is independent of the signature of 0. we obtained
the last expression of (3.6) using the explicit form v0 = (x1  ix2, r  x3)t. however, the
general formula for 1, eq. (3.4), is in fact invariant under the local phase and scale transfor-
 , f  }v0 = 0 valid for any f (r). this corresponds
mation of v0 due to the identity v
to the fact that the eigenvalue  of (3.1) is invariant under the right multiplication v  v  h
for an arbitrary h(r). we shall discuss the gauge transformation property of the eigenvalues
in the nal section.


0{m0  0

let us evaluate various eigenvalues of the system using the formula (3.6). first, the scalar

eigenvalues are obtained by substituting m0(r) = f (r)/2r2 as

 =

f (r) 

ibxi
4r2 f (r) + o(2).

(3.7)

next, we shall consider the eigenvalues of the magnetic eld bi  (1/2)ijkfjk near the
innity r  . the magnetic eld itself is given from the solution (2.18) as

2r2bxaa +

2r3 (ij  3bxibxj) j

r4(cid:19) .
  + o(cid:18) 1

(3.8)

bi =  bxi

c

bxi/2r2 and m1(r, ) = c (ij  3bxibxj) j

we would like to evaluate the o() contribution to the eigenvalues by putting m0(r) =
 /2r3. since m0(r) in this case is o(1/r2), using
the formula (3.6), the order of the correction to the eigenvalues from this part is found as
o(1/r4). thus near the innity, the o(1/r3) part of the eigenvalues of the magnetic eld is
saturated by m1.

4 interpretation of the eigenvalues

in this section, we shall see how the eigenvalues (3.7) and (3.8) reproduce the brane cong-
uration depicted in g. 1. in the brane picture, the end of the d-string is seen as a magnetic
charge in a single d3-brane worldvolume theory. the prediction from the brane congura-
tion is that the magnetic charge on each end of the d-string is actually moved in dierent
directions between the upper and lower d3-branes, as shown in g. 1. this shift is specied
by the spatial vector i.

now, the eigenvalues of the magnetic eld (3.8) indicate that the u(1) part of the mag-
netic eld exhibits a dipole structure. this structure is exactly the one expected from the
brane picture above. noting that the zero-th order solution (2.9) represents 1/2 charge on

since the denition of the magnetic eld contains the -product in itself, we should calculate also the

poisson bracket term. however, this term contributes only to the o(1/r4) part in (3.8).

the upper d3-brane and 1/2 charge on the lower, it is easy to derive the non-locality i as

i = ci.

(4.1)

this result veries the prediction of ref. [11] with the identication c = u.

although the magnetic charges are expected to indicate only the locations of the ends of
the d-string, the eigenvalues of the scalar eld must reproduce not only the locations of the
ends but also the slope of the d-string. in fact, the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues
(3.7) is given using (2.11) as

(4.2)

eq. (4.2) implies rst that in the upper and the lower d3-brane the end of the d-string sits
at xi = ci/2 and xi = ci/2, respectively. hence the non-locality is precisely given by
i = ci, in agreement with the result (4.1) from the magnetic eld. secondly, in order to
read o the slope of the d-string from (4.2), we rewrite it as

 =

this equation means that, for a given value of , the corresponding worldvolume coordinate
is located on a sphere with its center at xi = i. interpreting the trajectory of the center
as the d-string, our analysis reproduces precisely the tilt of the suspended d-string.

in g. 2 we present the curves of the eigenvalues of the scalar eld. the thin straight lines
represent the brane conguration of g. 1. the dashed curves denote the eigenvalues of the
scalar eld with  = 0. comparing these with the bold curves representing the eigenvalues
(3.7) with  6= 0, we can read o the simple brane conguration of ref. [11]. (the reason
why the bold curves are cuto for small |x1| in g. 2 is that the o() term of the scalar
eigenvalues (3.7) are actually divergent at the origin r = 0. we shall discuss this problem in
the next section.)

5 summary and discussion

in this paper, we solved the bps equation of the ncsym to the rst non-trivial order in .
evaluating the eigenvalues of the solution, we explicitly showed that the solution exhibits
the brane conguration of the tilted d-string, given in ref. [11]. magnetic eld has the dipole
structure, and the scalar eld is also shifted to reproduce the tilted trajectory of the d-string.

some comments are in order. our rst comment is on the gauge transformation prop-
erty of the eigenvalue  in our non-commutative eigenvalue equation (3.1). of course, the
eigenvalue  in eq. (3.1) is never strictly invariant under the local gauge transformation of
m,

m  u 1  m  u.

(5.1)

however, we can show that the eigenvalue has a fairly nice property under (5.1). consider
an innitesimal gauge transformation on m with u =   + i ( = ). then, the changes of
m0 and m1 under the gauge transformation are

m0 = i [m0, ] ,

m1 = i [m1, ] 

1
2

({m0, }  {, m0}) .

(5.2)

taking into account that the zero-th order eigenvector v0 transforms as v0 = iv0, the
change of 1 of eq. (3.4) under the gauge transformation is given after a little algebra as

1 = v


0{, 0}v0,

(5.3)

for a normalized v0. since 0 is gauge invariant, the result (5.3) implies that, at least to o(),
the gauge transformation corresponds to a coordinate transformation on the eigenvalue (r).
in the u(2) case with (r) = a(r)a + 0(r) , the form of the coordinate transformation is
xi = ij (cid:16)j0 + v

0av0 ja(cid:17).



8

therefore, we have shown that the eigenvalue of (3.1) for m and the one for u 1m u are
related by a coordinate transformation on the d3-branes and hence are physically equivalent,
at least to the rst non-trivial order in . recalling also that the eigenvalue of (3.1) is
independent of the choice of the eigenvector and that the scalar eigenvalue (3.7) has an
invariance under the simultaneous rotation of xi and ij, the eigenvalue equation (3.1) we have
adopted is a satisfactory one. these good properties, in particular, the gauge transformation
property of , are expected to persist to higher orders in .

our second comment is on another type of non-commutative eigenvalue equation,

m  v = v  ,

(5.4)

where, compared with (3.1), v and  are interchanged on the right hand side. eq. (5.4) has
a property that the eigenvalue  is invariant under the gauge transformation (5.1) of m.
however, for a given m the eigenvalues are not unique and do depend on the choice of the
eigenvectors v. what is worse, in the analysis similar to those in sec. 3 by adopting (5.4), we
can show that it is impossible to obtain the the scalar eigenvalues possessing an invariance
under the simultaneous rotation of xi and ij. these are the reasons why we did not adopt
(5.4).

our nal comment is concerning the singular nature of the scalar eigenvalues (3.7) at the
origin r = 0. since we have adopted the eigenvalue equation (3.1), the matrix whose diagonal
entries are these eigenvalues is no longer a solution of the bps equation. hence although
the eigenvalues (4.2) diverge at the origin, the energy of the conguration is still nite. we
would need a technique beyond the expansion in powers of  to dissolve the singularity at
the origin.

our analysis in this paper can straightforwardly be applied to the case of dyons. we
obtain a result consistent with the non-locality predicted by [11]. it would be an interesting
subject to study the non-commutative 1/4 bps dyons using our formulation.

note added

while writing this paper, we became aware of the paper [16] which has an overlap concerning
the solution of sec. 2.
