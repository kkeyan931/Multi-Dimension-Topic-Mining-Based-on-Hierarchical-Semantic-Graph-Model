abstract

we present a description of the type iib ns-ns p-branes in terms
of topological solitons in systems of spacetime-lling brane-antibrane
pairs. s-duality implies that these spacetime-lling branes are ns9-
branes, s-dual to the d9-branes of the type iib theory. the possible
vortex-like solutions in an ns9, anti-ns9 conguration are identied
by looking at its worldvolume eective action. finally we discuss the
implications of these constructions in the description of bps and non-
bps states in the strongly coupled heterotic so(32) theory.

1 introduction

recently, very signicant progress has been made in our understanding of the
role of non-bps congurations in string theory, and interesting connections
between some bps branes and non-bps branes have been uncovered (see [1]
for reviews and references therein). it is by now well-known that the bps
dp-branes of the type ii theories can be understood as bound states of a
certain number of spacetime-lling branes or brane-antibrane pairs in the
theory. in the type iib case one considers spacetime-lling brane-antibrane
pairs built out of bps type iib d9-branes charged with respect to the rr
10-form potential [2], whereas in type iia the spacetime-lling branes are
the non-bps d9-branes introduced by horava in [3]. the bps dp-branes
appear as topological defects in the worldvolume of these unstable systems.
an improved understanding of the physics of tachyonic excitations present
in unstable branes or brane-antibrane pairs has been the key ingredient for
these developments [4]. the presence of tachyons is no longer viewed as
a severe pathology of the theory, and a tachyon can be considered like a
true higgs eld which tends to develop a stable vacuum expectation value.
the simplest example is the description of a bps dp-brane in terms of the
condensation of the tachyonic mode of the open string stretching between
a pair of d(p+2) anti-d(p+2) branes [5], process which can be iterated to
construct lower dimensional d-branes by brane descent relations.

starting with an unstable system of spacetime-lling brane-antibrane
pairs, one can analyse the homotopy groups of the vacuum manifold of the
higgs eld (tachyon) which appears in the system, and deduce the possi-
ble stable defects corresponding to stable d-branes [2, 3, 6].
in the type
iib case, the system of coincident d-branes and anti d-branes is in fact
characterised by equivalence classes of pairs of vector bundles (one for the
d-branes and one for the anti d-branes) which correspond to congurations
of spacetime-lling branes up to creation and annihilation, and permit to
classify the stable dp-brane charges 1. these classes appear to be described
in a mathematical framework in terms of k-theory groups [7, 2]. more pre-
cisely, in the type iib case the stable dp-brane charges are classied by the
k-theory groups k(s9p), where the sphere s9p represents the dimensions
transverse to the worldvolume of the p-brane (compactied by adding a point
at innity) and k stands for the subgroup of k dened by restricting the
equivalence classes to the same number of branes and antibranes. there is a
close relation between k-theory (which characterises the conserved d-brane

1in type iia, since one starts with unstable uncharged d9-branes, describing the con-

served charges in terms of equivalence classes is less direct [3].

charges and congurations of spacetime-lling branes up to creation and an-
nihilation) and homotopy theory (which classies the topological defects).
the k-theory groups of spheres are equal to the homotopy groups of the
vacuum manifold of the higgs eld that appears in the worldvolume theory
of the system of spacetime-lling d9 anti-d9 branes.

these beautiful developments in our understanding of bps and non-bps
states refer mainly to d-branes, and very little is known about possible exten-
sions to the ns-ns charged p-branes (see however [8, 9] for some qualitative
results). in this paper, we propose to make a step further in this direction
and study in the framework of type iib theory such possibilities. we consider
the s-dual picture of the usual spacetime-lling brane-antibrane construction
of type iib, and by studying a system of coincident ns9 anti-ns9 branes dis-
cuss the dierent possible topological defects in the type iib and heterotic
so(32) theories.

the paper is organised as follows. in section 2 we review the construction
of the bps dp-branes of type iib as bound states of spacetime-lling d9 anti-
d9 pairs. section 3 discusses the s-dual picture and shows how the ns-ns
branes of the type iib theory can be understood as bound states of ns9
anti-ns9 systems. we then turn in section 4 to the study of the p-branes
of the heterotic so(32) theory as bound states of ns9 anti-ns9 branes in
a heterotic background.
in particular, we consider the description of the
heterotic so(32) theory as an orientifold of strongly coupled type iib by the
s-dual of worldsheet parity reversal [10, 11]. finally, section 5 contains the
conclusions.

2 type iib dp-branes as bound states

in this section we briey review the construction of the bps dp-branes of
the type iib theory as bound states of a certain number of spacetime-lling
d9 anti-d9 pairs [2]. the bps dp-branes appear as topological solitons in
the worldvolume of this system, and the explicit way in which they couple
can be simply read from the worldvolume eective action of the 9, 9 pairs.
the wess-zumino part of the worldvolume eective action of a dp-brane

is given by [12]:

s = zp+1

c  tref

(2.1)

where c is the complex of dierential forms which is the sum of the rr
potentials. more specically, in the case of n coincident d9-branes we are
interested in, one has:

3

swz

d9 = zr9+1

trhc (10) + c (8)  f + c (6)  f  f + c (4)  f  f  f +

+c (2)  f  f  f  f + c (0)f  f  f  f  fi ,

(2.2)

where c (p) denotes a p-form rr-potential, f = db(1)  u(n) 2 represents
the ux of a fundamental string ending on the branes, and the trace is taken
over the u(n) indices.

the eective action describing brane-antibrane pairs contains additional
worlvolume elds. one has, in addition to f , a second eld strength f ,
associated with the antibranes, and a complex charged tachyon eld t . the
wz term has a similar but slightly more involved structure [13]. it contains
a term :

z c  (ef  ef 

)

(2.3)

along with tachyon-dependent terms which we will not consider here since
they will not be important for our discussion. in fact, to discuss the possible
realisations of d-branes as topological defects one can focalise on the wz
terms of the brane action (2.2) instead of the ones of the brane-antibrane
pairs (2.3), bearing in mind that the topologically non-trivial character of
the soliton can be carried by one of the two eld strengths, say f (see for
instance [5]).

we now turn to the analysis of the wz terms of (2.2). the second term in
this action provides a description of the d7-brane as a bound state d9, anti-
d9. the d9, anti-d9 system is unstable due to the existence of a tachyonic
mode in the open strings connecting the two types of branes. the tachyon
can condense in a topologically non-trivial way [5], and this condensation is
accompanied by a localised magnetic ux such that:

trf = integer .

(2.4)

zr2

therefore a vortex soliton behaving as a d7-brane is induced, since the inte-

gration of trf gives a coupling rr7+1 c (8) in the d9, anti-d9 eective action.

similarly, the other terms in this action describe other type iib dp-branes
as bound states of a certain number of pairs d9, anti-d9. generically, a p-
brane can be realised, by a stepwise reasoning, as a bound state of a system
of n (p + 2k)-brane anti-brane pairs for n = 2k1 [2], since the homotopy

the vector eld since it will be irrelevant in the discussion that follows.

for f  u(2), since for k = 2 n = 2. the structure of the wz term implies
that this instanton-like conguration carries c (6) charge, and can therefore be
identied as a d5-brane. in this way the d5-brane is realised as a bound state
of 2 d9, anti-d9 pairs of branes. the structure of the rest of the terms in the
wz action completes a general pattern: d7=(d9, anti-d9), d5=2 (d9, anti-
d9), d3=4 (d9, anti-d9), d1=8 (d9, anti-d9) and d(-1)=16 (d9, anti-d9),
of type iib dp-branes as bound states of d9, anti-d9 pairs. this realisation
of the bps dp-branes as topological defects is coherent with the fact that
the reduced k-theory groups classing the conserved d-brane charges in type
iib are given by [2] k(s n), with n = 9 p, and that these groups are related
to the homotopy groups (see for instance [6]) as: k(s n) = n1(u(n)) for
suciently large n (i.e. in the stable range). one thus has k(s n) = z for
p odd and k(s n) = 0 for p even.

3 the s-dual picture

one important property of the type iib theory is however missing from the
previous construction, namely its s-duality symmetry, also manifest at the
level of the p-brane solutions. this symmetry implies that if, in particular,
the d1- and the d5-branes can be understood as vortex-like solutions in
pairs of d9, anti-d9 branes, the same should also be possible for the f1- and
ns5-branes, in this case as topological solitons in systems of ns9, anti-ns9
branes.

the so-called ns9-brane is by denition the s-dual of the d9-brane of
the type iib theory, and it is charged with respect to a non-dynamical 10-
form ns-ns eld, s-dual to the c (10) rr-potential to which the d9-brane
is minimally coupled [14]. this brane is indeed predicted by the analysis
of the type iib spacetime supersymmetry algebra [15]. its eective action
was constructed in [11] by performing an s-duality transformation in the d9-
brane worldvolume eective action. in this reference, and previously in [10],
it was also argued that the ns9-brane should play a role in the construction of
3the gauge group of the n brane-antibrane pairs is u(n) u(n), but it is broken to

the diagonal u(n) by the tachyon eld.

5

the heterotic string with gauge group so(32) as a nonperturbative orientifold
of the type iib theory. we will comment on the details of this construction
in the next section.

the ns9-brane eective action predicts the f1- and the ns5-branes as
bound states of 8 and 2, respectively, ns9 anti-ns9 pairs of branes. the anal-
ysis is the same than the one we have just made from the d9-brane world-
volume eective action. the d3-brane, being a singlet under the sl(2,z)
s-duality group, can be realised as a bound state of either d9, anti-d9 or
ns9, anti-ns9 branes, since both types of branes carry rr 4-form charge.
the same thing happens with the 7-brane and the instanton, though in this
case the explicit form of the solutions and worldvolume eective actions de-
scribing the branes at strong coupling is dierent from that in the weak cou-
pling regime (see [16]). in all these congurations the object whose tachyonic
mode condenses is a d1-brane, stretched between the ns9, anti-ns9 pairs.
the explicit form of the ns9-brane worldvolume eective action reads [11]:

swz

ns9 = zr9+1
+b(2)  f  f  f  f +

c (0)

(c (0))2 + e2

trhb(10) + c (8)  f + b(6)  f  f + c (4)  f  f  f +

f  f  f  f  f# .

(3.1)

here f describes the ux of a d1-brane ending on the ns9-branes4, b(10) is
the ns-ns 10-form potential with respect to which the ns9-brane is charged
and c (8) is the s-dual of the 8-form rr-potential (see [16]). the second term
in this action describes a 7-brane, realised as a bound state of one pair of
ns9, anti-ns9 branes. this conguration was predicted in [9], as implied
by the realisation of the m-theory kaluza-klein monopole as a bound state
of a pair m9, anti-m9. the third term in (3.1) is the s-dual of the term:

rr9+1 tr[c (6)f f ], that we discussed in the previous section, and describes

a ns5-brane as a bound state of two pairs of ns9, anti-ns9 branes. similarly,
the b(2)-term describes a fundamental string as a bound state of eight pairs
of ns9, anti-ns9 branes.

the structure of the ns9-brane wz terms implies that the ns-ns branes
of the type iib theory can be understood as bound states of ns9, anti-
ns9 pairs of branes. the general pattern that is derived from this analysis
is: d7=(ns9, anti-ns9), ns5=2 (ns9, anti-ns9), d3=4 (ns9, anti-ns9),
f1=8 (ns9, anti-ns9) and d(-1)=16 (ns9, anti-ns9), of type iib p-branes
as bound states of ns9, anti-ns9 pairs. therefore, we see that all the branes
predicted by the analysis of the type iib spacetime supersymmetry algebra,

4we have again omitted the contribution from the rr 2-form potential.

6

apart from the pp-wave and the kaluza-klein monopole, can be realised as
bound states of any of the two types of spacetime-lling branes of the theory.
of course for this to hold the ns9-branes must be considered on an equal
footing with the rr 9-branes. the pp-wave and the kaluza-klein monopole
solutions are only dened in spacetimes with one special, isometric, direc-
tion. in the case of the pp-wave this is the direction of propagation of the
wave, whereas in the monopole case this is the taub-nut ber of the trans-
verse space. therefore these branes cannot be understood as bound states
of spacetime-lling branes that do not see any of these special directions.

4 heterotic so(32) branes as bound states

in this section we discuss how the solitonic branes of the heterotic so(32)
theory can be understood as bound states of spacetime-lling branes. we
start by reviewing the type i case, since our description will strongly rely on
the s-duality connection between the two theories.

4.1 the type i case

all stable branes in the type i theory, including also non-bps ones, can be
realised as bound states of a certain number of d9, anti-d9 pairs of branes
[2]. the denition of the type i theory as an orientifold of type iib by its
worldsheet parity reversal symmetry makes clear that the analysis of section
2 holds straightforwardly in this case, with the only consideration of the
projections induced by the orientifold construction in the dierent gauge
elds. in particular the u(n) gauge group of a set of n coincident d-branes
is broken to so(n) for d1- and d9-branes and to sp(n) for d5-branes [17].
the general pattern of stable5 type i branes in terms of bound states of d9,
anti-d9 pairs is: d8=(d9, anti-d9), d7=2 (d9, anti-d9), d5=4 (d9, anti-
d9), d1=8 (d9, anti-d9), d0=16 (d9, anti-d9), d(-1)=32 (d9, anti-d9)
[2]. the d8, d7, d0 and d(-1) branes are non-bps. in the type i theory a
stable6, non-bps, p-brane with p even can be realised as a bound state of
bps (p+1), anti-(p+1) branes, given that the tachyonic mode that survives
in the spectrum in the type iib case is now projected out by the orientifold

5the d7 and d8 non-bps branes are however unstable due to the presence of a tachy-
onic mode in the open strings with one end on the brane and the other on one of the 32
d9-branes [18].

6the brane can end up however being unstable due to the presence of tachyonic modes
in the open strings with one end on the 32 d9-branes. this happens to be the case for
the d7 and d8 branes, as we have just mentioned.

7

construction [5], [19]. in this way the d8 is obtained as d8=(d9, anti-d9)
and the d0 as d0=(d1, anti-d1)=16 (d9, anti-d9). the d7 and d-instanton
are obtained as: d7=(d7, anti-d7), d(-1)=(d(-1), anti-d(-1)) from type
iib branes, since the orientifold projection exchanges the brane with the
antibrane and eliminates the tachyon. therefore, d7=(d7, anti-d7)=2 (d9,
anti-d9), d(-1)=(d(-1),anti-d(-1))=32 (d9, anti-d9), using that in type iib:
d7=(d9, anti-d9), d(-1)=16 (d9, anti-d9) [2].

the general pattern of stable type i branes shows in particular that the
same bps brane in the type i and type iib theories can be obtained as a
bound state of a dierent number of spacetime-lling branes and antibranes.
as an example of how the number of spacetime-lling branes changes from
the type iib to the type i theory let us consider in some detail the case of the
d5-brane. in the previous section we discussed how 3(u(2)) = z implied
that the d5-brane could be understood as an instanton-like conguration
from 2 pairs of d9, anti-d9 branes. in the type i theory the gauge group of a
single d5-brane is sp(1)=su(2), and this implies that four pairs d9, anti-d9
are needed in the construction: a set of 4 pairs of d9, anti-d9 branes has
so(4)=su(2)su(2) gauge symmetry. one su(2) is used in the instanton
construction of the d5-brane and the other survives as its gauge group.
the d1-brane however is constructed from the same number of d9, anti-
d9 pairs of branes in the type i and type iib theories. one may wonder how
this is compatible with the intermediate step in which a d1-brane is realised
as a bound state (d5, anti-d5) in type i [5], whereas in the type iib case
one has that d1=2 (d5, anti-d5) 7. this dierent number of d5, anti-d5
branes is due to the fact that in the type i theory a single d5-brane carries
already an su(2) gauge group, and therefore the d1-brane can be realised
as a bound state of a single pair d5, anti-d5. then: d1=(d5, anti-d5)=8
(d9, anti-d9), using that in type i d5=4 (d9, anti-d9).

4.2 the heterotic case

it was argued in [10] [11] that the heterotic string with gauge group so(32)
could be obtained as a nonperturbative orientifold construction of the type
iib theory. this construction is determined by s-duality: if the type i the-
ory can be dened as an orientifold of the type iib theory by its worldsheet

7this is implied by the structure of the d5-brane worldvolume eective action, which

contains a term:

again an su(2) gauge structure is needed in order to have an integer instanton number.

parity reversal symmetry, its s-dual, i.e.
the heterotic so(32) should be
dened at strong coupling as an orientifold of the type iib theory by the s-
dual operation of worldsheet parity reversal. perturbatively, this operation
coincides with the (1)fl symmetry of the type iib theory, where fl is the
left-moving fermion number. modding out the type iib theory by (1)fl
gives rise to the type iia string [20], and this is determined by the twisted
sector that has to be added in order to restore modular invariance. how-
ever one can consider adding anomaly cancelling 9-branes as in the type i
theory, and this is the way in which the heterotic string can be produced.
s-duality determines that the background 9-branes must be ns9-branes, and
also that, nonperturbatively, (1)fl can be dened as the operation revers-
ing the orientation of the d-string. this worldsheet operation has associated
an orientifold xed plane with -32 ns-ns charge, and this charge is cancelled
through the addition of 32 ns9-branes, with one unit of ns-ns charge. to-
gether they reproduce the gauge sector of the heterotic so(32) supergravity
[11], including corrections in  already computed in the literature [21].

the massless spectrum of the heterotic f-string can be described in terms
of open d-strings with both ends on the f1, dd d-strings, and with one end
on the f1 and the other on an ns9-brane, dn d-strings, [11]. the dd d-
strings contribute with 8 scalars and 8 right-handed majorana-weyl spinors,
whereas the dn d-strings contribute with 32 left-moving fermions. the
analysis is completely analogous to that in [22], which shows that the bps
d-string of the type i theory has the same worldsheet structure than the
so(32) heterotic string. in that case open dd and dn f-strings provide
the d-string with the right massless eld content of the heterotic. in our
case the open f-strings are replaced by open dd and dn d-strings, which
have however the same massless sector than the f1-branes. this description
of the heterotic string arises at strong coupling. however, given that the
massless states are bps, it can be as well extrapolated to the weak coupling
regime. in this limit the so(32) charges tethered to the f1 are pulled onto
its worldsheet, since d1/f1  1/gs   and the d-strings collapse to a
point, giving the usual so(32) heterotic worldsheet currents.
so far the discussion has been focussed on the massless bps states. the
heterotic so(32) theory contains as well perturbative massive states in the
spinorial representation of so(32), which are non-bps but stable, given that
they are the lightest ones transforming as spinors of so(32). sen [5], [19]
showed that the correct way of describing these states at strong coupling is in
terms of a weakly coupled type i (d1, anti-d1) system. this conguration is
unstable due to the presence of a tachyonic mode in the open strings stretched
between the two branes, and moreover, since the two branes are spinors

9

under so(32) 8 the bound state cannot transform as a spinor. however,
compactifying the d-strings and switching on a z2 wilson line the tachyonic
mode can condense into a stable conguration dierent from the vacuum,
and transforming as a spinor of so(32) [5]. the mass of this conguration
was also computed in [5] and shown to correspond to a d-particle 2 times
heavier than the bps d-particle of the type iia theory. in the convention of
. at strong coupling
the second reference in [1] this mass reads: m =
one has, in the heterotic side:

2


1
gi

m =

2


gh ,

(4.2)

and this allows to determine how the mass of the perturbative spinorial states
in the heterotic theory, given by m = 2
 , gets renormalised as one increases
the heterotic coupling constant.

we can now take the following point of view to describe the spinorial
non-bps states of the heterotic theory in the strong coupling regime. a
bound state d0=(d1, anti-d1) in the weakly coupled type i side predicts a
bound state (f1, anti-f1) in the strongly coupled heterotic theory. s-duality
determines that each of these f1s transforms in the spinor representation of
so(32), since dn open d-strings contribute with these quantum numbers,
and that the whole system is unstable due to the presence of a tachyonic
mode in the open d-strings stretched between the two f1s. s-duality de-
termines as well that if the system is compactied a state transforming as a
spinor under so(32) should emerge after the condensation of the tachyonic
mode. the mass of this state is formally given by the same expression as
in the weakly coupled type i case. in the d0 = (d1, anti-d1) system the
mass is evaluated at the critical radius rc where the eective mass square
of all the tachyonic excitations becomes non-negative and the two lightest
ones have zero mass [5]. this yields to md0 = 2(2rc)d1 where rc = q 
2 .
then it is argued [5] that this mass is actually independent of the radius
of the compactication, providing us with the mass of the d-particle in the
non-compact limit. now, in the (f1, anti-f1) heterotic system the corre-
2 gh and the mass
2 . this provides
an alternative interpretation of the result (4.2) in terms of an (f1, anti-f1)
bound state. this description at strong coupling is also natural from another
point of view. in the heterotic theory the non-bps states in the spinorial

sponding strong coupling radius is given by rc = q 
gh, where we used f1 = 1
is m = 2(2 rc)f1 = q 2

8a bps d1-brane carries the quantum numbers of the spinorial representation of

so(32) [23].

10

representation of so(32) correspond to unwrapped fundamental strings, i.e.
to strings not charged with respect to the ns-ns 2-form potential. this
charge cancellation is simply achieved by the f1, anti-f1 superposition.

it is also interesting to point out that the heterotic fundamental string
can arise as a bound state of a pair of ns5, anti-ns5 branes, since this is the
s-dual conguration of the d1=(d5, anti-d5) bound state in type i. this
is implied by s-duality and can be read as well directly from the ns5-brane
eective action truncated to a heterotic background, in particular from the

term [24]: rr5+1 trhb(2)  f  fi. in turn, the ns5-brane is obtained as a

bound state of four ns9, anti-ns9 pairs of branes. this is s-dual to the
d5=4(d9, anti-d9) conguration in type i, and can also be derived from
the ns9-brane eective action (3.1) truncated to a heterotic background9.
as we discussed in the previous section, from the so(4) gauge structure
of four d9, anti-d9 pairs of branes only an su(2) subgroup survives after
the instanton construction, and it remains as the gauge group of the d5-
brane.
in a polchinski-witten type of analysis this yang-mills multiplet
with su(2) gauge symmetry comes from open strings with both ends on
the d5-brane, whereas the d5-brane so(32) currents arise from dn open
strings, i.e. from strings with one end on the 5-brane and the other on a d9-
brane [17]. hull [10] argued that the same massless modes should be present
on the heterotic 5-brane worldvolume, in this case coming from open d-
strings with dd and dn boundary conditions, and with ns9-branes as the
spacetime-lling branes. therefore, the ns5, anti-ns5 pair of branes has
an su(2)  so(32) gauge structure, from which the su(2) is used in the
instanton construction of the f-string and the so(32) group survives as its
gauge structure.

finally, let us mention that s-duality seems to imply that the s-dual of
the non-bps type i d-instanton has the eect of breaking the o(32) gauge
group of the heterotic at strong coupling10 to its so(32) gauge symmetry
group (see [2]).

5 conclusions

we have presented a description of the ns-ns p-branes of the type iib
theory in terms of bound states of pairs of ns9, anti-ns9 spacetime-lling

theory and it is also supported by the worldvolume structure of the ns9-

brane. orientifolding this, strongly coupled, type iib theory by the s-dual
of worldsheet parity reversal we have provided a description of the heterotic
so(32) branes as topological solitons in systems of ns9, anti-ns9 pairs of
branes truncated to a heterotic background. the picture that emerges is
s-dual to the stable brane spectrum of type i in terms of bound states of d9,
anti-d9 branes, and gives an interesting description of the strongly coupled
non-bps spinorial states of the heterotic so(32) in terms of bound states
(f1, anti-f1), as well as a description of the f-string as a bound state (ns5,
anti-ns5).

t-duality on the strongly coupled type iib theory also gives interesting
predictions in the type iia side. we have seen that the type iib fundamen-
tal string can be obtained as a bound state (ns5, anti-ns5) as: f1=(d3,
anti-d3)=2 (ns5, anti-ns5), where the tachyonic mode of a d-string con-
denses. the t-dual picture describes a fundamental string as a bound
state of two ns5, anti-ns5 branes, where rst the tachyonic mode of a
d2-brane condenses and then the tachyonic mode of a dierent brane, a
d0-brane: f1=(d2, anti-d2)=2 (ns5, anti-ns5)11. from the worldvolume
eective action of the type iia ns5-brane this is described by the term:

rr5+1 b(2)  da(2)  dc(0), where a(2) and c(0) denote, respectively, the 2-form

and scalar worldvolume elds of the ns5a-brane (see [25]).

the t-dual picture of our description of type iib branes from ns9, anti-
ns9 systems gives a realisation of type iia branes as bound states of ns9a-
branes, which are t-dual to the ns9-branes of the type iib theory. this
9-brane is predicted by the analysis of the type iia spacetime supersymme-
try algebra [15], but contains a killing direction in its worldvolume, some-
thing that is determined both from the t-duality transformation and from its
eleven dimensional description as an m9-brane (see [11]), so that it is really a
domain-wall type of solution and not a spacetime-lling brane. therefore, it
seems that if one wants to have brane descent constructions which preserve
ten dimensional lorentz invariance one is constrained to use the non-bps
but spacetime-lling d9-branes introduced by horava in [3].

finally, it would also be interesting to analyse similar congurations to
the ones studied in this paper in the heterotic e8  e8 theory. t-duality
on the strongly coupled heterotic so(32) theory should provide interesting
congurations in the strongly coupled heterotic e8e8 side, in its description
as a nonperturbative orientifold of the type iia theory [11]. we hope to
report progress in this direction in the near future.

11we can alternatively consider the process: f1=(d4, anti-d4)=2(ns5, anti-ns5). now
rst a d0-brane condenses and then a d2-brane. these intermediate processes have been
discussed in [8, 9].
