abstract

in this paper a general solution is found for a ve dimensional orbifold spacetime
that induces a k = 0 cosmology on a three-brane. expressions for the energy density
and pressure on the brane in terms of the brane metric are derived. given a metric on
the brane it is possible to nd ve dimensional spacetimes that contain the brane. this
calculation is carried out for an inationary universe and for a metric that corresponds
to a radiation dominated universe in standard cosmology.
it is also shown that any
k = 0 cosmology can be embedded in a at ve dimensional orbifold spacetime and the
equation of the three-brane surface is derived. for an inationary universe it is shown
that the surface is the usual hyperboloid representation of de sitter space, although it
is embedded in an orbifold spacetime.

introduction

over the last few years there has been a great deal of interest in the possibility that
we live on a three dimensional brane embedded in a higher dimensional space. horava
and witten [1] showed that in the strongly coupled limit e8  e8 heterotic string theory
can be viewed as an 11 dimensional theory on the orbifold r10  s1/z2 with gravitons
propagating in the bulk and super yang-mills elds conned to the two ten-branes that
form the boundary of the spacetime. recently a novel solution to the hierarchy problem
was proposed [2, 3, 4] by considering the possibility that n of the compactied dimensions
are large. it was shown that the eective 4 dimensional planck mass mpl is related to
the 5 dimensional planck mass m via m 2
pl  m 2+nv(n), where v(n) is the volume of the
compactied space. thus, if the extra dimensions are large enough it is possible to have
a small m (even on the order of a tev) with mpl  1019 gev. therefore, the hierarchy
problem can be solved by reducing the 5 dimensional planck mass. for m  1 tev they
found that n > 2 to avoid conicts with observations if the standard model elds are
conned to a three brane while gravity propagates in the bulk. for n = 2 astrophysical
constraints force m > 100 tev [5, 6] and the size of the dimensions is constrained to be
< 5  105 mm.
two other interesting possibilities were recently suggested by randall and sundrum
[7, 8]. in their rst model they considered a ve dimensional spacetime with the fth
dimension, labeled by w, compactied on s1 with wc  w  wc and with the orbifold
symmetry w  w. the brane at w = 0 is a domain wall with positive tension and
the brane at w = wc is a domain wall with negative tension. they showed that mass
scales on the negative tension brane can be severly suppressed, leading to a solution
of the hierarchy problem. of course, this assumes that we live on the negative tension
brane. it was shown by shiromizu, maeda, and sasaki [9] that the eective einstein eld
equations on the negative tension brane involve a negative gravitational constant which
means that gravity would be repulsive instead of attractive. however, they showed that
one does recover the correct einstein equations in the low energy limit on the positive
tension brane. more recently, it has been shown [10] that the problem with the negative
tension brane may disappear if the extra dimension is stabilized by a radion eld. in
the second scenario of randall and sundrum we live on the positive tension brane and
the negative tension brane is moved o to innity. thus, in this scenario the extra
dimension is innite in extent. as usual the elds of the standard model live on the
brane and gravity lives in the bulk. they showed that there is a single gravitational
bound state conned to the brane that corresponds to the graviton. they also showed
that, even though the extra dimension is innite, the eective gravitational interaction
on the brane is that of a four dimensional spacetime with some very small corrections.
some aspects of the cosmology of branes embedded in higher dimensional spacetimes
have been examined. binetruy, deayet, and langlois (bdl) [11] showed that the scale

where k(5) is the ve dimensional einstein constant.
i have dropped a term in this
equation proportional to t55 by taking the bulk to be empty. as they pointed out, this
equation is similar to one of the equations from standard cosmology except that the
source terms are nonlinear. this leads to nonstandard cosmological evolution. csaki,
graesser, kolda, and terning [12] then showed that one can get standard evolution at
late times if the brane has a cosmological constant b. note that b is dierent than the
bulk cosmological constant, as it is conned to the brane. if b >> , p the right hand
side of (1) gives the usual source terms plus nonlinear corrections that will become small
at late times. one remaining dierence between this scenario and the standard one is
that equation (1) is second order. in the standard scenario the evolution is governed
by a rst order equation and the initial condition a(t = 0) = a0 (if there is an initial
singularity a0 = 0) is sucient to determine the solution for a given equation of state
in a k = 0 universe. on the other hand, the k = 0 cosmology on a brane depends on
a(t = 0) as well. specic ve dimensional and three-brane cosmologies have also been
discussed by various authors [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].

in this paper a general solution is found for a ve dimensional orbifold spacetime
that gives a k = 0 cosmology on a three-brane. the energy density and pressure on the
brane are written in terms of the metric on the brane. it is shown that it is possible
to nd ve dimensional spacetimes that contain a brane with a given metric. this
procedure is carried out for an inationary universe and for a metric that correspond
to a radiation dominated universe in standard cosmology.
it is also shown that any
k = 0 cosmology can be embedded in a ve dimensional at orbifold spacetime and the
embedding equation is found. for an inationary universe it is shown that the surface
is the usual hyperboloid representation of de sitter space, although it is embedded in an
orbifold spacetime.

cosmology in the five dimensional space-time

here we consider a ve dimensional spacetime with w labeling the extra dimension. the
fth dimension is taken to be compactied on s1 with wc  w  wc. an orbifold
s1/z2 is produced by identifying w and w, so that the range of w can be taken to be
0  w  wc. the spacetime contains a three-brane at w = 0 and at w = wc. these
branes will, in general, have non-zero surface energies and pressures. we will take the
brane at w = 0 to be the brane we live on and the brane at w = wc will be a hidden
brane.

to simplify the form of the metric we can use a gaussian normal coordinate system
in this coordinate system g55 = 1 and g5 = 0 ( =

based on the brane at w = 0.

0, 1, 2, 3). assuming that the three dimensional spatial sections are at gives

ds2 = b2(t, w)dt2 + a2(t, w)[dx2 + dy2 + dz2] + dw2.

(2)

since it is always possible to write a two dimensional metric in conformally at form we
can take the metric to be

ds2 = c(t, w)[dw2  dt2] + a2(t, w)[dx2 + dy2 + dz2].

transforming to retarded and advanced coordinates u = t  w and v = t + w gives

ds2 = c(u, v)dudv + a2(u, v)[dx2 + dy2 + dz2]

the einstein eld equations rkl = gkl in the bulk give

where  = 2/3(5) and (5) is the ve dimensional cosmological constant. first con-

c(u, v) = c1f

where f (u) and g(v) are arbitrary functions of u and v respectively and c1 is an arbitrary
constant. if ua = va = 0 then

a = a1

c(u, v) = f (u)g(v).

(11)

where a1 is a constant. since all of these solutions correspond to minkowski spacetime
on the brane and in the bulk they will not be discussed further. if va = 0 and ua 6= 0
then

c(u, v) = c2h



transforming (9) and (10) back to (t, w) coordinates and imposing the orbifold con-

a similar result holds if ua = 0 and va 6= 0.
dition w  w gives
ds2 = | f(u) g(v)|[f (u) + g(v)]2/3(dw2  dt2) + [f (u) + g(v)]2/3(dx2 + dy2 + dz2)

where u = t|w| and v = t +|w| and i have absorbed some constants into the denition
of t and w. since the sign of c1 cannot be absorbed the coecients gtt and gww should
have a  sign. i have forced the correct spacetime signature by using absolute values
instead and by restricting f and g to be positive. note that f and g interchange roles
as we cross the brane at w = 0. transforming (12) back to (t, w) coordinates gives

ds2 = | h(u)|k(v)(dw2  dt2) + h2(u)(dx2 + dy2 + dz2)

(14)

where k has been taken to be positive. this metric corresponds to a at ve dimensional
spacetime since the riemann tensor vanishes. however, the geometry induced on the
brane will not, in general, be at. for notational simplicity the metric in both cases will
be written as

ds2 = n2(t,|w|)[dw2  dt2] + a2(t,|w|)[dx2 + dy2 + dz2]

(15)

where n and a are given in (13) or in (14).

now consider  6= 0. here  will be taken to be positive, as in the randall-sundrum

model. eliminating c(u, v) from (5) and (7) and integrating gives

a(u, v) = h[f (u) + g(v)]

(16)

where h, f (u), and g(v) are arbitrary functions. solving for c(u, v) from (5) and (7)
gives

where  is an arbitrary constant. substituting a(u, v) and c(u, v) into (6) gives

c(u, v) = f (u)g(v)h[f (u) + g(v)]

hh + 2(h)2 =

the solution then simplies to

the four dimensional spacetime on our brane will be described by the metric

thus given f and g or h and k we can nd the metric and the energy-momentum tensor
on the brane. for example if f (t) = g(t) we nd that

ds2

(4) = d 2 +  (dx2 + dy2 + dz2)

(33)

where d = | f|(2f )1/3dt. this is the spacetime for a radiation dominated universe
in the standard scenario. however, as can be seen from (29) and (30) the pressure
and energy density on the brane vanish! note that this is consistent with equation (1)
found by bdl. it is also important to note that minkowski space is also a solution
for the spacetime on the brane if  = p = 0. surprisingly, at spacetime also arises
with  = 3p = (4/k2
it is important to note that the
energy densities and pressures above arise in the ve dimensional einstein equations.
if an observer on the brane dened t (4)
 the energy densities and pressures
obtained would dier from the above expressions. once we have f (t) and g(t), which
specify the cosmology on the brane, we can extend the solution into the bulk by using
(23) or (24). for example if f + g =constant, which gives at spacetime on the brane,
then

ds2 = f (t  |w|)2(dw2  dt2) + dx2 + dy2 + dz2.

(34)

this is at ve dimensional spacetime. if f (t) = g(t) = t on the brane the bulk metric
is given by

ds2 = d 2 +  (dx2 + dy2 + dz2) +

dw2,

(35)

which corresponds to a ve dimensional anisotropic kasner cosmology. of course, for
other choices of f and g the bulk spacetime metric will depend on w.

for the remainder of this section i will work with metrics of the form (14). as
discussed earlier all metrics of this form correspond to a at ve dimensional spacetime.

to see this let u = h(u) and v = k1(v) = r k(v)dv (for simplicity i have taken h > 0).

in these coordinates the metric is given by

ds2 = dudv + u2(dx2 + dy2 + dz2).

the coordinate transformation that takes this to the at spacetime metric

ds2 = dudv + dx2 + dy2 + dz2

is

u = u

v = v + ux2

xk = uxk

(36)

(37)

(38)

where x2 = xkxk. this transformation can easily be found by using the null geodesics
as coordinate lines. thus, the transformation from (t, w, xk) to (t, w, xk) is given by

t = 1

w = 1

2[k1(t + w) + (x2 + 2)h(t  w)],
2[k1(t + w) + (x2  2)h(t  w)],

(39)

xk = h(t  w)xk,

(t  w), v = (t + w), and  is a constant with dimensions of length.
where u = 1
the orbifold in ve dimensions is produced by identifying the points x(t, xk, w) and
x(t, xk,w), where  labels the ve dimensional spacetime. the surface of the brane
can therefore be parameterized by

t = 1

2 [k1(t) + (x2 + 2)h(t)],

w = 1

2 [k1(t) + (x2  2)h(t)],

xk = h(t)xk,

(40)

where (t, xk) are the coordinates on the surface. this surface can also be described by
the equation

t2  w2  x2  y2  z2 =   t  w

 ! k1"h1  t  w

 !# .

now given any metric of the form

ds2

(4) = dt2 + a2(t)(dx2 + dy2 + dz2)

(41)

(42)

it is easy to see that h(t) = a(t) and k1(t) = r dt

a(t) . thus, any k = 0 cosmology can
be embedded in a at ve dimensional orbifold spacetime. for example consider the
inationary cosmology with a(t) = eht. the equation of the surface is

t2  w2  x2  y2  z2 = 

1
h 2 .

(43)

this is the usual hyperboloid representation of de sitter space except that it is embedded
in an orbifold spacetime.

finally, we will show that it is possible to nd a three brane metric and the equation
of its surface given the energy density on the brane. instead of working with the metric
in the form (24) it is convenient to work in a coordinate system in which the metric
takes the form

ds2

(4) = d 2 + a2( )[dx2 + dy2 + dz2]

(44)

conclusion

a general solution was found for a ve dimensional orbifold spacetime that induces a
k = 0 cosmology on a three-brane. expressions for the energy density and pressure
on the brane where found in terms of the metric on the brane. it was shown that it
is possible to nd ve dimensional spacetimes that contain the brane given the brane
metric. this procedure was carried out for scale factors a( ) = eh and a( ) =  1/2. it
was also shown that any k = 0 cosmology can be embedded in a at ve dimensional
orbifold spacetime and the embedding equation was found. for an inationary universe
it was shown that the surface is the usual hyperboloid representation of de sitter space,
although it is embedded in an orbifold spacetime.
