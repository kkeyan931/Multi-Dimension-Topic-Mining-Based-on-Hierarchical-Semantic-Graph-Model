abstract

the critical dynamics of the chiral symmetry breaking induced by gauge interac-
tion is examined in the wilson renormalization group framework in comparison with the
schwinger-dyson approach. we derive the beta functions for the four-fermi couplings in
the sharp cuto renormalzation group scheme, from which the critical couplings and the
anomalous dimensions of the fermion composite operators near criticality are immediately
obtained. it is also shown that the beta functions lead to the same critical behavior found
by solving the so-called ladder schwinger-dyson equation, if we restrict the radiative
corrections to a certain limited type.

1. introduction

the chiral symmetry breaking phenomena has been one of the key issues to be un-
derstood in the non-perturbative dynamics of gauge theories. the analytical study of
this problem has been initiated by the nambu-jona-lasinio (njl) model [1], which was
introduced as the eective theory with four-fermi interactions. for gauge theories par-
ticularly the schwinger-dyson (sd) equaitons in the ladder approximation with landau
gauge [2, 3] have been intensitively studied and applied not only to qcd but also to the
various models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking [4, 5]. in qcd, the ladder
sd equation with the running gauge coupling constant, the improved ladder [6], was found
to give good results even qantitatively [7]. however the ladder sd equations are known
to suer from some serious problems, specially the strong gauge dependence [8] and the
diculty to proceed beyond the ladder approximation [9].

on the other hand the wilson renormalzation group (rg) [10] has been known to oer
the powerful method to analyze critical phenomena and has been applied to the various
dynamical problems mainly in the statistical mechanics. the so-called exact rg equations
[10, 11, 12], which are the concrete formulation of the wilson rg in the momentum
space, has been recently applied to numerical study of non-perturbative dynamics in eld
theories. the application to the qcd dynamics has been also considered in this framework
[13]. the advantageous features of this method, compared with the sd approach, are that
the critical behavior is analyzed directly form the rg eqautions, and that it admits the
systematic improvement of approximation by the derivative expansion and truncation
of the wilsonian eective action [14, 15]. interestingly it is rather recent that the rg
method has been applied to the fermi liquid theory of superconductvity [16], which the
njl model was considered in analogy with. also it should be noted that the fermi liquid
theory of high density qcd was studied by the rg analyses [17].

in this paper we examine the chiral critical dynamics in gauge theories by using the
exact rg equations, specially putting our attention to the comparison with the sd ap-
proach. there have been known several formulations of the exact rg. here we simply
employ the wegner-houghton rg equations [11], which are derived with sharp momen-
tum cuto, in the so-called local potential approximation for our present purpose. the
analyses with the exact rg equations with smooth cuto may be performed as well [18].
it will be found that the critical behavior is determined from the beta-functions of the
eective four-fermi couplings induced by gauge interaction with remakably simple calcula-
tion. the phase boundary and also the anomalous dimensions of the composite operators
of fermions near the criticality will be evaluated. our approximation scheme adopted
here is even better than the ladder approximation performed in the sd equations on the
critical behavior. actually, as is seen later, if we make further approximation so as to
pick up only a few types of the radiative corrections, then the critical behavior is reduced
to be identical to that obtained by solving the ladder sd equation.

2. scheme of the rg equations

the ladder sd equation for the fermion mass function is given in the form of an integral
equation, where the momentum integration is carried out with sharp cuto. in order to
see the direct relation between the critical dynamics obtained by the two methods; the

1

sd equation and the rg equation, we consider the exact rg equation dened with sharp
cuto in this paper. there have been known the several formalisms for the exact rg
[10, 12]. here we shall adopt the so-called wegner-houghton rge [11] derived as follows.
if we devide the freedom of the quantum eld (p) into the higher freqency modes
with |p| >  and the lower frequency modes with |p| <  by introducing the cuto scale
 in the euclidean formalism, then the wilsonian eective action at this scale, se[; ],
may be dened by integrating out the higher frequency modes in the partition function.
namely

z = z y|p|<0

d(p) es0[;0] = z y|p|<

d(p) ese[;],

(1)

where s0 denotes the bare action with the bare cuto 0. this eective action contains the
general operators invariant under the original symmetries in the bare action, for example
the chiral symmetry of our present concern.

the wegner-houghton rge determines the variation of the wilsonian ective ac-
tion under the innitesimal change of the cuto . for example, the rge for the d-
dimensional scalar eld theory is found to be given exactly as

,(2)

where t = ln(0/) is introduced as the scale parameter. the 1st line of the rge
represents nothing but the canonical scaling of the eective action. while the 2nd line
comes from the radiative corrections which correspond to the tree and the 1-loop feynman
diagrams including only the propagators with the momentum of the scale .

in the practical analysis it is inevitable to simplify this rge by some approximation.
here we shall examine the rge in the so-called local potential approximation [11, 19]. in
this approximation the radiative corrections to any operators containing derivatives are
ignored in the rge (2). therefore solely the potential part of se, ve, may be evolved
with the shift of . it should be noted that the wave function renormalization is ignored
in this scheme. the rge for the scalar theory is given explicitly by

(3)

where ad = 2/(4)d/2(d/2) is the factor from the momentum integration. this equa-
tion oers us a set of the innitely many beta functions for the general couplings appearing
in ve. however it should be noted here that each beta function may be evaluated through
just one loop corrections with the general eective interactions. the non-perturbative
nature of the rge is supposed to be maintained by solving the innitely many coupled
renormalization equations. actually it has been known that this approximated rge is
quite eective in the case of the scalar theories [14, 15]. the generalization of this rge to
include fermions has been also studied in the relation with the triviality-stability bound
for the higgs boson mass in the standard model [20].

now let us consider to apply this formulation to the massless fermions coupled by
gauge interaction. for example we may take the action of the massless qed as the bare
action

where  is the gauge parameter. as is well known, the gauge invariance is not main-
tained anymore, once the momentum cuto is performed. therefore the generic gauge
non-invariant operators are generated in the wilsonian eective action. then we must
encounter the rather complicated problem to pick up the special rg ows corresponding
to the gauge invariant theories in the innite dimensional coupling space. recently it has
been discussed how to deal with the gauge theories in the framework of the wilson rg
by using the modied slavnov-taylor identities [21].

here, however, we shall simply ignore the corrections to the operators including the
gauge elds as well as imposing the local potential approximation as the rst step to-
wards the analysis of the chiral symmetry breaking phenomena. then we may avoid the
intriguing problem of the gauge invariance, since any gauge non-invariant operators do
not appear in the eective action. this approximation is indeed so rough as to make the
beta function of the gauge coupling vanish identically, therefore it cannot be supposed
to give any picture of the real dynamics of the gauge theories. however, on the other
hand, the so-called ladder approximaton used in the sd approach also totally ignores the
vertex corrections as well as the corrections to the gauge kinetic functions. therefore it
would be meaningful to examine the rge in this scheme in comparison with the sdes
in the ladder approximation. the eect of the running gauge coupling will be discussed
in section 4. nevertheless this approximation scheme is thus rather crude, it will be seen
that the chiral critical behavior may well be described. actually it will be found that this
approximation is even better than the ladder approximation applied for the sd equations.
the wilsonian ective action to be solved by the rge in this scheme is now reduced

to the form of

where ve(, ) denotes the general potential composed of the chiral symmetric multi-
fermion operators. these multi-fermion operators, which are induced by exchange of the
photon with higher momentum. the so-called gauged njl model is often examined
in the sd approach and the phase diagram in the two parameter space of the gauge
coupling and the four-fermi coupling has been examined [3]. however, in the rg point
of view, this coupling space should be regarded as a subspace of the innite dimensional
coupling space of the wilsonian eective action. it should be noted also that these multi-
fermi operators are irrelevant or non-renormalizable, and therefore, are not considered in
the perturbative qed. however they cannot be simply discarded in the strong coupling
region. it will be seen in the next section that the four-fermi coupling turns out to be
relevant near the criticality and plays a crutial role for the critical dynamics of the chiral
symmetry breaking.

3. critical dynamics of the chiral symmetry

in this section we examine explicitly the wegner-houghton rge in the approximation

3

discussed in the previous section. the form of the eective potential ve written in terms
of the fermions is found to be restricted into a polynomial composed of the following
parity and chiral invariant operators, which are mutually independent;

1

2 n( )2  ( 5)2o ,

o1 = ( )2 + ( i5)2 = 
o2 = ( )2 + ( 5)2,
o3 = n( )( 5)o2
.

therefore the 4-fermi part of the eective potential may be written down as

ve(, ; t) = 

gs(t)

22 n( )2 + ( i5)2o +

gv (t)

22 n( )2 + ( 5)2o .

(6)

(7)

hereafter let us call gs the scalar four-fermi coupling and also gv the vector four-fermi
coupling. 1

now let us evaluate the radiative corrections to these four-fermi operators, since it will
be found enough to see only these couplings for the purpose of understanding the critical
dynamics. by using the propagator of the gauge eld in the landau gauge ( = 0), the
rg equations for the four-fermi couplings are found to be

where we introduced the rescaled couplings, gs = gs/(42), gv = gv /(42),  =
3e2/(42). here we should note that any multi-fermi couplings more than four do not take
part in the radiative corrections for the four-fermi couplings owing to the 1-loop nature
of the rge. therefore we may obtain the rg ows within the 2 dimensional coupling
space (or 3 dimensional, if the gauge coupling is also taken into account) irrespectively to
other couplings.

in fig.1 the feynman diagrams representing the one-loop corrections to the four fermi
couplings are shown. let us call the corrections given by the diagrams in the dashed-
line box in fig.1 the ladder type, and the others the non-ladder type hereafter. if
we approximate the rge by restricting to the ladder type correction, then the beta
function for the scalar four-fermi coupling is found to be given by

fig.1: feynman diagrams of the radiative corrections to the four-fermi
couplings gs and gv considered in the rge (8). the diagrams sur-
rounded by the dashed line show the ladder type corrections.

(0, 0) is the ir trivial xed point, and (1, 1/8) is the uv xed point on the critical surface.
2 the rg ows are found as is shown in fig.2. it is seen that there are two phases divided
by a critical surface. the chiral symmetry is supposed to be spontaneously broken in
the upper region in fig.2. then we may realize that the chiral symmetry breaking is
caused essentially by the strong scalar four-fermi interaction, not by the vector four-fermi
interaction.

it is also easy to evaluate the exponents which are important physical quantities in
the critical dynamics. by linearlizing the rg equations around the uv xed point, the
dimensions of the relevant four-fermi coupling and the irrelevant four-fermi coupling are
found to be 2 and 5/2 respectively. the relevant four-fermi operator is given by the
combination of orel = o1  (1/8)o2. the renormalized trajectory in fig.2 is given by
the straight line passing through the non-trivial xed point. indeed we may deduce from
the rges (8)

d
dt

(gs  8gv ) = (2 +

1
2

gs)(gs  8gv ),

(10)

which means that once the combination of (gs 8gv ) is vanishing at a point, then it keeps
null along the renormalization ow. therefore the renormalized trajectory is precisely
given by the line of gs = 8gv . namely the eective four-fermi operator in the low energy
is just orel irrespectively to the phases.
next let us examine the rg equations (9) given by the ladder type corrections. for
each gauge coupling  there are the uv xed point and the ir xed point, which are
found to be

2 strictly speaking (g 

v ) = (1, 1/8) is not a xed point, since the beta function for the eight-fermi
coupling does not vanish there. however it turns out to be the non-trivial xed point for the space-time
dimension of 2 < d < 4. we do not consider the point (4, 2), since it seems to be fake due to this
approximation.

where + is for the uv xed point and  is for the ir xed point. namely they form a
xed line in the (, gs) space as shown in fig.3. the phase boundary is also shown in
fig.3. the upper region is supposed to be the chiral symmetry broken phase. the critical
gauge coupling is given by

cr = 1.

(12)

indeed this critical surface just coinsides with that obtained by solving the sde in the
ladder approximation [2, 3].

the anomalous dimension of the four-fermi coupling gs, g = 2 + dim[gs], near criti-

cality is immediately deduced from the rge (9) as

g = 4g

s() +  = 2(cid:16)1 + 1  (cid:17) ,

(13)

which is also found to coincide with the result by the ladder sde [3]. therefore it is seen
that our approximation used to derive the rges (8) is certainly better than the ladder
approximation. moreover it is easy to take the all corrections shown by fig.1 including
the ladder type ones in our framework. it should be noted that the sum of corrections
of the ladder diagram and the crossed ladder given in the last line of fig.1 is found to
be free from gauge parameter dependence. thus this extention of approximation beyond
ladder is signicant to obtain the gauge independent results [18]. we would like to
stress here that the exact rg equations allow us to examine the critical dynamics by
remarkably simple calculation, which is a clear contrast with the sd approach.

s(), g

now we are in a position to go beyond ladder by examining the full rg equations
(8). the xed line (g
v ()), which is given by the solution of the 3rd order equation
in turn, is shown in fig.3 and also in fig.4 by projection to the (, gs)-plane and (gv , gs)-
plane respectively. it is seen that the critical gauge coupling is now found to be slightly
bigger than the value in the ladder approximation, (cr = 1.0409). in fig.4 the critical
surface separating the two phases is also shown by the cross sections at various gauge
coupling up to the critical one. the critical surface given in the case of ladder type
should be compared with the cross section between the critical surface and the gv = 0
plane, which is found as shown in fig.3. it is seen that the phase boundary obtained by
our scheme is shifted towards outside compared with the phase boundary, which has been
known so far in the ladder sd approach.

the exponents at the xed line also are similarly obtained. the exponent or the
dimension of the relevant operator, which was found to be 2 in the previous analysis for
 = 0, reduces as the gauge coupling becomes larger. then it eventually vanishes at
 = cr, which is also seen directly from the eq.(8). in fig.5 the anomalous dimension
of the relevant four-fermi coupling g is presented in comparison with the ladder value
given by eq.(14).

before ending this section let us mention the anomalous dimension of the fermion
mass operator, which we denote m. in order to evaluate it we may incorporate the mass
term in the eective action. then the beta function for the mass m may be derived by
one-loop diagrams and is found to be

vanishes, therefore the vector four fermi coupling does not appear in this beta function.

dimensions satisfy the relation, m = g/2, which has been known also in the analysis of
the ladder sde [3]. in our analysis, however, m turns out to be fairly larger than g/2
and also than m obtained so far in the ladder sd approach.

4. rg ow with the running gauge coupling

so far the eect of the renormalization of the gauge coupling has been totally ignored,
therefore the obtained phase diagrams do not reect the realistic ones for gauge theories.
in the sd approach, the so-called improved ladder approximation [6], in which the gauge
coupling is simply replaced by the running coupling subject to the perturbative rge
apart from the sd framework, has been often used. however this prescription cannot
be regarded as systematic improvement of the approximation. on the other hand, in
the wilson rg framework it is possible to include the correction to the gauge coupling
naturally by improvement of the previous approximation. this makes a clear contrast to

if we try to treat the non-perturbative dynamics by strong gauge interactions faithfully
in the wilson rg framework, we must encounter the hard problems such as extraction of
the gauge invariant theories, development of simple approximation scheme, incorporation
of the topological excitations and so on. however, as a primitive approximation, we
may evaluate the wilson beta function of the gauge coupling by the 1st order correction,
namely the perturbative one. then it is enough to solve the rg equations given by (8) in
turn coupled with the perturbative rg equation for the gauge coupling . in fig.6 the rg
ows for qed obtained in this manner are shown in the (, gs)-plane. the critical surface
separating the spontaneously broken and the unbroken phases is maintained, while the
non-trivial xed points turn out disappear. note that the point (, g
v ) = (0, 1, 1/8) is
not a xed point in 4 dimensions.

s, g

the rg ows for the qcd like asymptotically free gauge theory is shown in fig.7.
these results should be compared with those obtained by solving the sd equations [22].
it is seen that the phase structure is completely swept o. the entire reagion is supposed
to be in the broken phase of the chiral symmetry, since the 4-fermi coupling keeps growing
in the infrared. the eective theories on the attracting line coming out from the trivial
xed point correspond to the continuum limit of qcd. namely this line gives the so-called
renormalized trajectory of qcd. however other ows of the gauged njl models, specially
starting at the critical point of the njl model in the uv limit, do not converge on the
renormalized trjectory. therefore it may be supposed that these ows show other renor-
malized trajectories. if this is the case, the gauged njl model oers non-perturbatively

8

renormalizable theories dierent form qcd. indeed existence of the non-trivial continuum
limit other than qcd, or renormalizability of some kinds of the gauged njl models has
been claimed so far [22, 23]. in our frame work of the non-perturbative rg, renormal-
izability of the gauged njl model may be shown by examining whether these ows are
really the renormalized trajectories or not. such studies will be reported separately [24].

5. discussions

in this paper we examined the chiral critical behavior of the gauge theories in the
wilson rg framework. we considered evolution of the eective potential composed of
the chirally invariant multi-fermi operators by the exact rg equation with sharp cuto
in the local potential approximation. the rg ow of the four-fermi couplings were found
to determine the phase structure. it is straightforwards and remarkably easy to nd the
critical surface and the anomalous dimensions of the composite operators of fermions
in this framework. moreover the critical dynamics obtained by solving the ladder sd
equations are exactly reproduced by restricting the radiative corrections taken in the beta
functions to the ladder type. while our rg equations contain also the non-ladder
type corrections, which are neccessary to obtain gauge independent physical results [18],
though we have considered only the case of the landau gauge in this paper.

however we cannot assert with this analysis that the chiral symmetry is indeed spon-
taneously broken in the region supposed to be the broken phase. in order to clarify it
we need to evaluate the order parameters such as the dynamical mass of the fermion, the

9

condensation of the composite operator of fermion, and so on. evaluation of these order
parameters is important especially in qcd, because they are the physical quantities to
show the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. while, for example, the spontaneous gen-
eration of the fermion mass itself seems to be even non-trivial in the wilson rg picture,
since the wilsonian eective action remains chiral symmetric in evolution, that is, there
is no room for the mass term to show up. these issues as well as the method to evaluate
the order parameters in the wilson rg framework will be also reported in a separate
publication [25].

in our analyses the rg eqaution for the gauge coupling was approximated by the per-
turbative one. of course the fully non-perturbative treatment for the rge is required to
see the dynamics of strong gauge interaction in infrared. it would be still an open ques-
tion whether the wilson rg approach gives a useful framework in this non-perturbative
region. however it may be said that the non-perturbative rg has a good chance to seek
for the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking phenomena in gauge theories further by going
beyond the level examined so far in the sd approach.
