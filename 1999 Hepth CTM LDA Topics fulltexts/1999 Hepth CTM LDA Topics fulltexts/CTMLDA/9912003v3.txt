abstract we consider the canonical quantization of fermions on an odd di-

mensional manifold with boundary, with respect to a family of elliptic hermitean

boundary conditions for the dirac hamiltonian. we show that there is a topological

obstruction to a smooth quantization as a function of the boundary conditions. the

obstruction is given in terms of a gerbe and its dixmier-douady class is evaluated.

0. introduction

in this paper we study the hamiltonian quantization of massless fermions on a

compact odd-dimensional manifold x with boundary y = x. field theories on

manifolds with boundary arise in several situations including gravitation on odd

dimensional anti-de sitter spacetimes [w]. our aim is to investigate topological

obstructions (or anomalies) arising from non-trivial topology in the boundary con-

ditions. we assume that a riemannian metric and spin structure is given on x.

the dirac eld might also be coupled to a yang-mills potential but in this pa-

per we shall concentrate only on the problem of the dependence of the canonical

quantization on the boundary conditions.

the obstruction to canonical quantization arises in the following way. we have

a family of hermitean dirac hamiltonians in a 1-particle space h. let g be the

parameter space for the family. in quantization the 1-particle space h is replaced

by a fock space fg (with g  g) and the 1-particle hamiltonian dg by a second
quantized hamiltonian dg. if the hamiltonians do not have any zero modes this does

not cause any problems. the fock space associated to the parameter g is dened

as the representation space for the algebra of canonical anticommutation relations

(car) with a vacuum vector (dirac sea) corresponding to the polarization of the

1-particle space h = h+(g)  h(g) to positive and negative eigenmodes of the

hamiltonian dg.

in case of zero modes the above construction is not continuous as a function of

the parameter g since h(g) is not a continuous function of g. this is a familiar

problem in the hamiltonian quantization of chiral fermions and its resolution is

related to the appearance of schwinger terms in the gauge current algebra which

form an algebraic obstruction to gauge invariant quantization of chiral fermions.

topologically the obstruction can be understood in terms of the structure of the

space a/g, the space of vector potentials modulo gauge transformations.

in the case at hand the space a/g is replaced by the parameter space g for

boundary conditions. the spectrum of the hamiltonian dg depends on the bound-

ary conditions and in the case of massless fermions zero modes will occur.

it turns out that one can avoid a detailed analysis of the zero mode set of the

family of hamiltonians (which in general is a complicated task). instead, the prob-

lem of constructing representations of the car algebra can be rewritten as the

problem of prolonging a principal bundle p over g, with structure group ures, to
a principal bundle with the structure group ures. here ures is the group of imple-
mentable bogoliubov automorphisms of the car algebra and ures is its central

extension. the bundle of fock spaces can be viewed as an associated bundle to the
prolongation, through a representation of ures in a fock space.

the topological obstruction to the bundle prolongation is a three-cohomology

class on the base g, the dixmier-douady class. in the case of chiral fermions this

has been discussed before in [cmm1]. in the present paper we shall compute the

dd class on the parameter space g and we show that it indeed gives a nonzero

obstruction to a continuous second quantization of fermions.

2

it turns out that the parameter space g can be naturally identied as the group

of unitary operators g in a xed hilbert space such that g  1 is a trace class

operator. the cohomology of this group is known. it has one generator in each

odd dimension and no generators in even dimensions. an explicit representation

for the odd generators is given by the wess-zumino-witten type dierential forms

tr (dgg1)2k+1 on the group manifold. we are interested only on the form with

k = 1 and we shall prove that this (when properly normalized) is the dixmier-

douady class for the bundle prolongation.

the plan of the paper is as follows. in section 1 we shall describe the parametriza-

tion of self-adjoint elliptic boundary conditions for dirac operators in odd dimen-

sions and recall some facts about canonical quantization. in section 2 we shall go

through some technicalities related to local triviality of the relevant bundles and

explain in more detail the relation between canonical quantization and the princi-

pal bundle p. in section 3 we rst explain general aspects of gerbes and their dd

class and we give two dierent constructions for a universal ures bundle (bundle

with contractible total space) over the parameter space g. these will be needed in

section 4, where we nally compute the dd class for the bundle prolongation and

the associated gerbe.

1. boundary conditions and fock spaces

we consider dirac operators on an odd dimensional compact manifold x with

boundary y. as an additional technical assumption we require that the metric

becomes a product metric near the boundary and that the normal component of

the gauge potential a and the normal derivatives of a vanish at the boundary.

then near the boundary the dirac equation can be written as

ictt = hy ,

where hy is the dirac operator on the boundary, t is a local coordinate in the

normal direction and ct denotes cliord multiplication by the unit normal in the t

direction. the operator hy anticommutes with cliord multiplication by ct.

in order that the dirac operator in the bulk x becomes an elliptic fredholm

operator we use atiyah-patodi-singer type boundary conditions. these elliptic

3

boundary conditions are labelled by projection operators p on the boundary hilbert

space l2(y, s) (where s denotes the combined spin and gauge vector bundle) such

that the dierence p  p+ is a trace-class operator. here p+ is the projection on

to the spectral subspace on which hy is positive. the boundary condition is then

written as

p |y = 0.

the precise estimate on p  p+ is actually not very critical in the following. of-

ten one requires that p  p+ is a smoothing operator. this has advantages when

studying the analytical properties of dirac determinants. however, for analyzing

topological properties of the family of dirac operators parametrized by such bound-

ary conditions it turns out to be more convenient to work in the trace-class setting.

in order that dp is hermitean we must have

p ct = ct(1  p ).

we shall use the parametrization of the boundary conditions studied in [s]: for each

boundary projection p above we think of p (l2(y, s)) as the graph of an unitary

operator

t : s+  s,

where s are the eigenspaces of the chirality operator ct on the boundary. if t0 is
the unitary operator corresponding to the projection p+ then k = t t 1

should

0

dier from the identity operator in l2(y, s) by a trace-class operator.

denote by g the group of all unitaries g in l2(y, s) such that g  1 is a trace-

class operator. thus g is the parameter space of the elliptic hermitean boundary

conditions for the family of dirac operators dp and henceforth we write dg, g  g

to denote elements in this family.

for each g  g we would like to produce a fermionic fock space fg carrying

an irreducible quasi-free representation of the canonical anticommutation relations
(car) and a compatible action of the second quantized dirac operator dg. here

quasi-free means that there is a vacuum vector |0 > fg such that

a(v)|0 >= 0 = a(u)|0 >

for all v  h+ and u  h where h+  h is the polarization of the 1-particle

hilbert space h = l2(x, s) to positive and negative frequencies with respect to

4

the dirac operator dg. the car algebra is generated by the relations

a(u)a(u) + a(u)a(u) =< u, u >

for u, u  h with all other anticommutators zero and the hilbert space inner

product < ,  > is antilinear in the rst argument.

note that in general one cannot expect that there would be a continuous choice

|0 >= |0 >g of vacuum vectors parametrized by the boundary conditions g  g;

the vacuum line bundle (in case it is well-dened) could be nontrivial. in fact, we

shall show that there is a more serious problem: there is a topological obstruction

to the above quantization of fermions parametrized smoothly by elements of g.

the obstruction appears as follows. in order to dene the quasi-free represen-

tation of the car algebra we need a polarization h = h+(g)  h(g) of the

1-particle space h. this polarization should be a continuous function of the bound-

ary condition g  g. furthermore, each fock space fg dened by the polarization

should contain the vacuum vector for the dirac operator dg = ictt + hy,g, that is,

the vacuum dened by the splitting to positive and negative spectral subspaces of

dg. this requirement is equivalent to the condition that the plane h+(g) lies in the

innite-dimensional grassmannian grg consisting of all closed subspaces w  h

such that the dierence pg  qg is hilbert-schmidt; here pg is the orthogonal pro-

jection onto h+(g) and qg is the orthogonal projection onto the positive spectral

subspace of dg.

we have now a bundle of innite-dimensional grassmannians {grg| g  g}

(modelled by the ideal of hilbert-schmidt operators) over the base g. we still

need to show that this bundle is dened in terms of local trivializations and smooth

transition functions. once this is done we will show that the potential obstruction

to quantization is the topological nontriviality of this bundle.

proposition 1. the bundle gr is smoothly locally trivial.

the proof is given in appendix 1.

2. the obstruction to canonical quantization

a closer examination reveals that the discussion in section 1 is not quite accurate

5

in the sense that often one would be satised with a determination of the car

algebra representation without an explicit choice of the vacuum vector.

to explain this let us denote by ures the group of unitaries t in a complex

polarized hilbert space h = h+ h such that the commutator [p+, t ] is hilbert-

schmidt; here p+ is the orthogonal projection onto h+. this group acts naturally

and transitively on the grassmannian gr(h+) consisting of closed subspaces w 

h such that pw  p+ is hilbert-schmidt, where pw is the orthogonal projection

onto w.

over gr(h+) there is a canonical complex line bundle det. when the projec-

tion from w to h+ has fredholm index equal to zero, the ber at w is the set

of equivalence classes [q, ], where q : h+  w is an isomorphism such that

p+q  idh+ is trace-class and   c. the equivalence is dened by (q, ) 

(qt1, det t), where t : h+  h+ is an isomorphism with t  1 trace-class; for

details, see [prse].

a central extension ures of ures acts in the total space of det, [prse]. this

extension acts unitarily in the fermionic fock space corresponding to the given

polarization h = h+  h.

if a representation of the car is given with respect to a polarization h =
h+  h then the set of (normalized) fock vacua is a ures orbit through some

xed vacuum |h+ > dened by the polarization. the orbit of h+ under the ures
action is the innite-dimensional grassmannian gr(h+) and the ures orbit in the

fock space is the set of vectors of unit length in the canonical determinant bundle

det over gr(h+).

in the case of a family of grassmannians, the construction of the family of car

representions can now be formulated as the problem of prolonging the grassman-

nian bundle to a bundle with ber equivalent to the determinant bundle det.

there is an illuminating alternative formulation of the prolongation problem which

we shall now describe.

the grassmannian gr(h+) is a homogeneous space ures/(u (h+)u (h)). the

topology of the block diagonal unitary group u (h+)  u (h) is trivial by kuipers

theorem. thus ures contracts to gr(h+). it follows that the prolongation of a ures
bundle over some base manifold to a ures bundle is equivalent to the problem of

prolonging the associated grassmann bundle to a bundle with model ber det.

6

the relevance of the ures bundle in fock space quantization is immediate: selecting
a model fock space with a ures action, one can construct a bundle of fock spaces
as an associated vector bundle to a given ures bundle.

to close the circle, we note that starting from the given grassmanian bundle

over the parameter space g one constructs a natural ures bundle p such that the

grassmannian bundle is recovered as an associated bundle. if h = h+  h is any

xed polarization then the ber of p at g  g consists of all unitaries h in h such

that h  h+  grg.

instead of looking at the specic construction of the ures bundle over the family

of boundary conditions g we can extend this to another universal construction over

the space of all (bounded) self-adjoint fredholm operators f such that the essential

spectrum is neither negative nor positive. this means that the spectral subspaces

both on the negative and positive side of the real axis are innite-dimensional. the

topology in f is dened by the operator norm. the fact that dirac operators are

unbounded need not bother us since we shall be really interested only on the spectral

resolutions dened by the sign operators (d  )/|d  |, which are bounded.

the space f retracts onto the subspace f consisting of operators with essential
spectrum at 1, [as]. thus it is sucient to study the ures bundle p  over f.
a at a  f is dened as the set of unitary operators g in h+  h
the ber p 
such that g  h+ belongs to the grassmannian gr(wa) where wa is the positive

spectral subspace of the operator a.

the proof of the local triviality of the bundle p  is a slight extension of the

argument which was used in the proof of proposition 1. first, we can choose an

operator norm continuous (smooth) section f : u (h)/(u (h+)  u (h))  u (h)
(again by kuipers theorem). dening u, for 1 >  > 1, as the open set in f

consisting of operators a such that  6= spec(a) then g(a) = f ((a)/|a|) is
a local section of p  with local norm continuous transition functions g = g1

 g.
the hilbert-schmidt norm continuity (and smoothness) of the o-diagonal blocks

follows as in proposition 1 since, by our assumption about the essential spectrum

of a, the spectral subspaces corresponding to the open intervals ], [ are nite-

dimensional for 1 <  <  < 1.

7

3. a universal construction

in this section g denotes the group of unitary operators g in h such that g  1

is trace-class.

let p be a locally trivial principal ures bundle over g. the lie algebra of ures

is dened by the standard 2-cocycle

(1)

c(x, y ) =

1
4

tr [, x][, y ].

let (u) be a family of open contractible sets covering the base g. let l  ures be
the complex line bundle associated to the circle bundle 1  s 1  ures  ures  1.

let  : u  p be a family of local trivializations of the bundle p. let g be

the corresponding family of ures valued transition functions. we dene a family of

local line bundles over the open sets u = u  u by pull-back, l = g

l.

since ures is a group we have a natural isomorphism

(2)

lg  lf  lgf

for all g, f  ures. this gives a family of isomorphisms

(3)

l  l = l

over the common intersections u = u  u  u . thus we have a bundle

gerbe q over the base g, [cmm1,cmm2]. the product structure gives also a
1.

1 and therefore an isomorphism l  l

natural isomorphism lg  lg1

combining this with (3) we obtain a natural trivialization f of the product

bundle l  l  l over u.

the family {f} of trivializations (local s 1 valued functions) satises the co-

cycle condition

ff 1

ff 1

 = 1

on the intersections of four open sets.

because of the relations (3) the local curvature forms  = g

c satisfy the

relations

(4a)

[] + [] + [] = 0

8

in de rham cohomology h 2(u) on the base. note that these equations do not

hold on the level of dierential forms. however, this can be corrected by adding an

exact 2-form d to each of the closed forms ; the modied forms  satisfy

then

(4b)

 +  +  = 0.

actually, because of the given local trivializations f on triple intersections we

have the consistency condition

(5)

f = 0,

where  is the connection on the trivial bundle l l l composed from

the connections on the factors l with curvature forms . in fact, (5) implies

(4b): if a is a local potential, da = , then (5) can be written as

df + (a + a + a)f = 0,

and multiplying by f 1

 and then taking the exterior derivative gives the cocycle

relations (4b) for the forms .

if () is a partition of unity on g subordinate to the covering (u) then we can

produce a closed 3-form on g in the usual way. first, we have a closed 3-form 

on u,

 = dx

 = x

d.

since  = 0 on u they can be pasted together to give the closed 3-form 3 on

g. this is the de rham form of the dixmier-douady (dd) class of the bundle gerbe.

of course, this description disregards all potential torsion information. however,

for our purposes the dierential form picture is quite sucient since we going to

show that there is already on this level an obstruction to quantization.

unfortunately the existence of a partition of unity on the innite-dimensional

manifold g does not appear to be known. however, in order to dene the dd

class as an element of the dual of the 3-homology classes it is sucient to use the

partition of unity on the (singular) homology 3-cycles and to pull-back the forms

 down to the embedded 3-cycles and then proceed as above. an alternative

solution would be to replace g by the group of unitaries diering from the identity

9

by a hilbert-schmidt operator (which is a hilbert manifold) where we would have

a partition of unity.

note however that whichever method we use to dene the dd class we can

normalize it so that its integral around closed 3-cycles is 2 times an integer.

in the case when the gerbe is coming from a principal ures bundle p over g

there is another method to construct the dixmier-douady class which gives directly

the integrals of 3 over 3-cycles in g. the homology cycles can be generated by

mappings from s 3 to g, so we shall restrict to this case.

map the 3-disk d3 onto the sphere s 3 such that the boundary is mapped to one

point g  s 3. pulling back the bundle p to d3 leads to a trivial ures bundle over

d3. in this trivialization the boundary s 2  d3 is mapped to the ber pg over g.

selecting a base point x in the ber we can identify pg  ures. the integral of the

curvature form c over s 2 gives then the integral of 3 over s 3  g. note that the

result does not depend on the choice of the base point x since a dierent choice x

is related by a right translation x = x  q by an element q  ures. the cohomology

class [c] is invariant under right (and left) translations on the group manifold. one

can check that this construction gives the same result as the one starting from the

cocycle of 2-forms . namely, selecting a local trivialization of the bundle p at

g  g such that g is mapped to the point x in the ber, we observe that the map

s 2  ures above is just the transition function from the local trivialization over d3

to the local trivialization around g. the rest follows from stokes theorem, using

the fact that  = d1  d1 on the overlap and that  =  = 3 on u.

universal ures bundle over g. let p be the space of smooth paths (parametrized

by 0  t  2) in g with initial point 1  g. we also require that the derivatives of

g(t) vanish at the end points. to each g  p there corresponds a vector potential

a on the circle s 1, with values in the lie algebra g of g, a(t) = g(t)1g(t). the

group g of based loops at 1  g acts freely from the right on p through gauge

transformations ag = g1ag + g1g and the set of orbits is p/g = g. since

clearly p is contractible, p is the universal g bundle over g. the local triviality

of the path bration is obtained by the exponential mapping; locally, near the unit
element, the trivialization is (g, h) 7 h, where g  g, h(t) is a based loop at 1, and
h(t) = exp(tz)h(t) with exp(2z) = g.

by bott periodicity, g is homotopy equivalent with ures. actually, we can

10

dene a group homomorphism j : g  ures which is a homotopy equivalence, see

appendix 2 for proofs. the group g acts, by denition, as the unitary group of 1

+ trace-class operators in a complex hilbert space h. let h = l2(s 1, h) and let

h = h+ h be the polarization to nonnegative and negative fourier components.

then each g  g acts naturally in h, by pointwise multiplication, and this action

gives the promised homomorphism to ures(h+  h). the homomorphism can be
used to dene an associated bundle p = p g ures with ber ures. this latter

bundle is then a universal ures bundle over g, see proposition 2.

remark. there is an alternative construction of the universal ures bundle over g

which makes its appearance in quantum eld theory (qft) more transparent. for

each gauge potential a(t) = g(t)1dg(t), g  p, let wa be the set of unitary opera-

tors t in h such that the projections onto the subspaces t  h+ and h+(da) dier

by a hilbert-schmidt operator; here h+(da) is the positive frequency subspace for

the dirac operator da. it is easy to see that if both t, t   wa then t  = t h

for some h  ures. consequently, one can view wa as a ber in a principal ures

bundle over p [cmm2]. the base is contractible, thus there exists a global section

a 7 ta. actually, we can construct explicitly a global section by setting

ta = tf 1df = f,

that is, ta is the multiplication operator by the function f (t) on the interval [0, 2].

we can dene a ures valued 1-cocycle for the natural g action on p by

s(a; g) = t 1

a tag .

in the case of the choice ta = f above, we have simply s(a; g) = g. this cocycle
denes the same associated ures bundle p over g as above, by the equivalence
relation (a, t )  (ag, t s(a; g)) for g  g and t  wa.

proposition 2. the total space of the bundle p is contractible and thus p  g

is the universal ures bundle over g.

proof. by a well known theorem in homotopy theory [g] a space with the homotopy

type of a cw complex is contractible if it is weakly homotopy equivalent to a point.

all of the spaces we consider are banach manifolds and have the homotopy type

that of a cw complex. we want to compare the homotopy groups of p, which are

11

all trivial, with the homotopy groups i( p). from the appendix 2 we know that the

embedding j of g to ures is a homotopy equivalence. this embedding extends to
an embedding of principal bundles j : p  p by mapping p  p to the equivalence
class of the pair (p, e)  p  ures in p; e is the identity element in ures. on each

bre this map reduces to j. this means we have a commutative diagram

i(g)



j 
 i(ures)



i+1(g)

where the up arrows represent the connecting maps for the homotopy long exact
sequences for the locally trivial brations p and p respectively.

since i(p ) = 0 for all i, by the homotopy exact sequence

...i+1(g)  i(g)  i(p )  i(g)  ...

the connecting map k : i+1(g)  i(g) is an isomorphism (both groups are

known to be 0 when i is odd and equal to z when i is even (these facts rely on

results of palais, see [q] for a discussion). from the commutative diagram above
it follows that the corresponding map for the bering ures  p  g is also

an isomorphism and from the homotopy long exact sequence for this bering we
conclude that i( p ) = 0. moreover this shows that j is a weak homotopy equivalence
from which we deduce that p is a contractible.

4. the dixmier douady class

next we want to relate the dixmier-douady class 3  h 3(g, z) of the various

gerbes over g to the natural curvature 2-form on the group g. recall that this

curvature form on g is the homogeneous 2-form

(6)

2 =

1

2 zs1

tr (g1dg)

d
dt

(g1dg).

we start from the universal g bundle p over g and its bundle gerbe as de-

scribed in section 2.

proposition 3. the cohomology class [3] is represented by the closed 3-form

12

(7)

3 =

1

12

tr (g1dg)3.

proof. we have to show that the integral of 3 over any closed 3-cycle on g agrees

with the integral of 3. we can generate 3-cycles by 3-spheres, so we take as the

3-cycle a (dierentiable) mapping  of s 3 into g. since g is connected, we can

assume the image under  of s 3 is such that the poles of s 3 are mapped to the

unit element in g.

we cut the 3-cycle s 3 along the equator to two disks b+ and b. over these

disks the pullback under  of the principal bundle p  g is trivial; choose a pair of

local trivializations  over b. concretely, the local trivializations can be dened

as follows. for each x  s 2 on the equator we have path t 7 +(x)(t)  s 3 by

connecting the point x by a segment of a great circle to the to the north pole.

similarly, we obtain a path (x)(t) by connecting x by a great circle to the south

pole. we choose the parametrization such that t = 2 corresponds to the point x

and t = 0 corresponds to either of the poles (which is mapped to the unit element

in g). setting  =    the transition function on the equator (with values

in g) is then given by +(x, t) = (x)(t)g(x, t) for some g(x, .)  g. on the

other hand, (x, t) 7 (x, t) is a parametrization of points on (b)  g and

therefore, by a simple calculation,

12zs3

3 = x=zb
= zs2s1

tr (

1d)3

tr (g1dg)3 + 3zs2

tr 

1d  dgg1.

the second term on the right vanishes since g(x, 2) = 1 on s 2. the rst term

on the right is

(8)

zs2s1

tr (g1dg)3 = 12zs2

2.

on the other hand, the integral on the right is equal to the integral of 3 over

s 3; this follows, by stokes theorem, directly from the construction of the dd class

13

3 from the family of local 2-forms  such that    =  and d =  =

3|u; recall that the class [] is given by the pull-back of 2 with respect to the

transition function g : u  g.

thus indeed

(9)

zs3

3 = zs3

3

and so 3 and 3 represent the same cohomology class.

the dd class is an obstruction to writing the line bundles l as tensor prod-

ucts l  l

 of local line bundles over the open sets u on the base, that is, an

obstruction to a trivialization of the gerbe q.

we use the following theorem, taken from [[k], theorem 3.17] in a slightly re-

formulated form:

theorem 1. [k]. let m be a compact space and [m, g] the set of homotopy classes

of maps from m to g. then k 1(m ) is isomorphic with [m, g]. the group structure

in the latter group is given by pointwise multiplication of maps.

on the other hand, we have seen that p can be viewed as an universal ures

bundle (or, what is essentially the same, as an g bundle) over g. thus we can

construct ures bundles over any compact space m by pulling back this universal

bundle via a map from m to g.

the index theorem in [mp], proposition 12, tells us that for a compact subset

m  g k 1(m ) is realised by homotopy classes of maps into the family of odd-

dimensional dirac operators parametrized by the boundary conditions m. by the

above theorem we can conclude that the universal ures bundle over g can be

identied as a (universal) ures bundle over the family of dirac operators (identied

topologically as the family g of boundary conditions).

in the case of the universal ures bundle over g we already know the dd class

of the bundle gerbe q is given by the generator (7) (devided by 2) of h 3(g, z).

thus this is also the (nontrivial) obstruction to a trivialization of the gerbe over

the space of dirac operators parametrized by the boundary conditions g.

as a conclusion we obtain our main result:

theorem 2. there is an obstruction to a prolongation of the ures bundle p (as

dened in section 2) over a compact submanifold m  g of hermitean elliptic

14

boundary conditions, that is, an obstruction to the construction of the bundle of

fermionic fock spaces for the dirac operators parametrized by m. the dixmier-

douady class of the obstruction is given by the restriction of the de rham class 3

to m.

in particular, the obstruction is nontrivial when m = u (n ) is any nite-

dimensional subgroup of g with n  2.

remark 1. we could interpret our family of dirac operators parametrised by g

as an element of k 1(g) if the latter were dened as homotopy classes of maps into

the self adjoint fredholm operators. as g is not compact this is problematic. for

our purposes it is enough to work with compact subsets.

remark 2. in the case of an odd-dimensional manifold without boundary there is

a similar obstruction to gauge invariant quantization, related to schwinger terms

in current algebra, [cmm1, cmm2]. recently the case of gravitational schwinger

terms was discussed in the same formalism, [em].

appendix 1: proof of the proposition 1

let t0 be any xed boundary condition, with t0 : s+  s a unitary map. if

t is another boundary condition then the graph of t is obtained from the graph
of t0 by the unitary transformation (u+, u) 7 (u+, g  u) with g = t t 1
0  g
and u  s. in a small open neighborhood u of 1  g we can choose in a smooth

way, for any g  u, a smooth path g(t) such that g(0) = 1 and g(1) = g; this is

achieved for example by writing g = exp(z) and setting g(t) = exp(tz).

near the boundary y we may think of the l2 functions on x as functions f (t, y)

on [0, 1]  y (where t is a parameter in the normal direction at the boundary) and

we can extend the action of g in the boundary hilbert space l2(y, s) to an action

on h = l2(x, s) by setting

(r(g)f )(t, x) = (f+(t, x), g(t)  f(t, x))

in the tubular neighborhood [0, 1]  y and r(g) acts as an identity on f outside

of this neighborhood. the map g 7 r(g) is smooth with respect to the l1 norm

in g and the operator norm in the algebra of bounded operators in l2(x, s). this

15

follows from the smoothness of the embedding of trace-class operators to the algebra

of bounded operators and from the smoothness of the exponential mapping.

clearly r(g) is an unitary operator in l2(x, s) and it maps the domain dom(dg)

onto the domain dom(d1) of the reference dirac operator. thus dg is unitar-

ily equivalent to the dirac operator r(g)dgr(g)1 in the xed reference domain

dom(d1).

next we choose a smooth mapping from the space of polarizations  in h to the

unitary group u (h) such that  = f ()0f ()1 where 0 is the xed reference

polarization given by the sign of the dirac operator d1. this mapping exists be-

cause the space of polarizations u (h)/(u (h+)  u (h)) is a contractible banach

manifold (with respect to the operator norm) by kuipers theorem.

with these tools we can write an explicit local trivialization of the grassmannian

bundle gr over g. near the unit element in g the hilbert-schmidt grassmannians

are parametrized as

(g, ) 7 f (g)f (g)1,

where   gr1 and g = r(g) dg

|dg | r(g)1. we have assumed that zero does not
belong to the spectrum of dg; otherwise, we replace dg by dg   for some real

number  in the neighborhood of g = 1.

because of the potential non-triviality of the kernel of the operator dg we cannot

have a global trivialization of the bundle. however, for each real number  the

trivialization described above is well-dened in the open set g consisting of those

elements g for which  / spec(dg). the transition function on the overlap g  g

is then given by

 7 f (g())1f (g())f (g())1f (g()),

where g() is dened as g above but with the shifted operator dg  . by the

construction, the transition function h(g) = f (g())1f (g()) satises

[0, h] = f (g())1f (g())

with  = g()  g(). now on the overlap g  g the dierence  has

constant nite rank and therefore also [0, h] has constant nite rank. a norm

continuous mapping to operators of constant nite rank is continuous also with

16

respect to the hilbert-schmidt norm (or with respect to any lp norm) which proves

the continuity of the ures valued transition functions. the same argument can then

be used for the derivatives of the transition function.

appendix 2: proof of the homotopy equivalence j

we dene a system of closed n forms (n = 2, 4, 6, . . . ) on the hilbert-schmidt

grassmannian gr(h+) for the polarization h = h+  h, by

(a-1)

n = antr f (df )n,

where f is the grading operator associated to w  gr(h+), that is, f restricted to

w is +1 and the restriction to w  is 1. note that since f 2 = 1, the dierentials

df anticommute with f. thus for odd n the form n vanishes identically; an is a

normalization coecient given by

an = (

1
2i

)j (j  1)!
(2j  1)!

, with n = 2j.

with this normalization the form n is the generator in h n(gr(h+), z).

since ures/(u (h+)  u (h)) = gr(h+) and the diagonal subgroup is con-

tractible, the natural projection p : ures  gr(h+) can be used to pull back the

generator n to the generator n in h n(ures, z). the projection can be written as

p(g) = gg1 = fg, where  is the grading associated to w = h+. it follows that

the pull-back of df is [, fg], where  = dgg1 is the maurer-cartan 1-form on

ures, and so

(a-2)

n = antr fg[, fg]n.

the homotopy type of both g and ures is known. the homotopy groups

vanish in odd dimensions whereas in even dimensions the homotopy groups are all

isomorphic with z, [c],[prse], [q]. a generator xn of the homotopy group n(ures)

when paired with the generator n of h n(ures, z) gives < xn, n >= 1. thus the

only thing we need to check to prove that the embedding j : g  ures is a

homotopy equivalence is to show that < j(yn), n >= 1 for all even n, where yn is

the generator of n(g).

17

the odd generators in h (g, z) are given by the dierential forms

(a-3)

2j1 = a2jtr 2j1.

from this one obtains by transgression the even generators in h (g, z),

(a-4)



2j = (2j + 1)a2j+2zs1

tr (g(t)g(t)1)2j.

we shall show that 

n is in the same cohomology class as the restriction of n to

the subgroup g  ures. provided that this is the case, we have 1 =< yn, 

n >=<

j(yn), n > and thus indeed j(yn) is the generator of n(ures), and consequently j

is a homotopy equivalence.

note that [, fg] = g[g1dg, ]g1 and therefore

(a-5)

n = antr [l, ]n,

where l = g1dg. the proof of the equivalence of n and 

n is through a standard

trick using the cartan homotopy method. we set l = 0 + 1 where 0 commutes

with  and 1 anticommutes with . dene gt = t2

1 + (1  t)2

0 for 0  t  1.

then by dl = 2

l we get

dgt =

gt = (2

actually, gn

0 is not trace-class. however, this operator is an even wedge power

of 0 and by the permutation properties of the wedge product it is a commutator

of some zero order pseudodierential operators on the circle. such an operator

is always conditionally trace-class: this means that the trace is evaluated by rst

taking the trace over matrix indices, then integrating the product symbol over

the circle and nally integrating over the momentum variable from  to  and

18

taking the limit   . but for conditionally trace-class operators tr[a, b] 6= 0,

in general.

in the present case we can write

(a-8)

tr gn

0 =

1
2

tr [0, 2n1

0

]

where we have used the fact that 0 commutes with . if a(x, p) and b(x, p) are

the symbol functions of a pair of zero order psdos a, b on the circle, then the

conditional trace of the commutator [a, b] is given by the expression

(a-9)

tr[a, b] =

p=

dp



p zx

dx tr (cid:18) a

x

(x, p)b(x, p)  a(x, p)

b
x

(x, p)(cid:19) .

since in the expression (a-8) above the momentum variable is contained only in

 = p/|p| and the derivative of this symbol is twice the delta function in momentum

space, we obtain

(a-10)

tr gn

0 =

1
2

i

2 zx

tr 2n1 d
dx

dx.

note that in the case n = 1 this is just the curvature on a loop group arising

from the canonical central extension of the loop algebra.

by integration in parts, we can conclude that the integral of (a-10) over any

compact 2n manifold m2n in g is equal to the integral

(a-11)

i

4 zm2n zs1

dx tr 2n(g1 d
dx

g) =

i

4(2n + 1) zs1m2n

tr 2n+1

and therefore this last expression under the integral sign represents the same coho-

mology class as (a-10), and therefore after a multiplication by the normalization

coecient a2n, through (a-7), the same class as (a-4). note that the coecient

in front of the integral on the right-hand side of the equation is equal to the ratio

a2n+2/a2n which is necessary to recover the correct normalization for 2n+1. this

proves that < j(yn), n >=< j(yn), 

n >= 1.
