questions pose someday seem inappropriate, much way longer see computation total cross section important problem strong interactions. still, hope questions phrase helpful confronting issues face thinking formulation string theory connection nature. now, approach string theory suered certain schizophrenia. weak coupling, beautiful picture, containing gravity, gauge interactions, chirality,

moduli describe compactication (at least, discussed above, cases low energy supersymmetry). course, hope accidents. ratios scales might small, couplings eective lagrangians might small, simply accident. underlying theory still likely strongly coupled. without assumptions, one little hope predicting anything 4 theses circumstances. discuss below, supersymmetry, holomorphy, symmetries may
