abstract

schrodinger equation with two-component wave function which de-
scribes a relativistic spin 1/2 particle in a weak electromagnetic eld is
obtained.
in the same approximation schrodinger equation with tradi-
tional norm condition and one-component wave function for a spinless
particle is obtained as well. to construct it foldy-wouthuysen procedure
with the electron charge value as the small parameter is used.

introduction

attempts to describe the electron which moves with the speed close to the
speed of light by two-component wave function appeared after the creation
of the relativistic quantum mechanics.
it was connected with the fact that
in the nonrelativistic case the electron is described by two-component wave
function. however, in 1932, dirac had shown that the relativistic electron is
described by four-component wave function which is the solution of the dirac
equation. trying to nd pauli equation as the limit case of dirac equation foldy
and wouthuysen [1] supposed for it the unitary transformation method. this
method allowed describing the positive energy states of the free particle by the
large components of the four-component spinors and negative energy states by
the small components. it means that the positive energy state is described by
the spinor which has third and fourth components equal to zero and the negative
energy state is described by spinor with the rst and second components equal to
zero. in the case of the presence external electromagnetic eld such separation
had been done approximately with 1/c as the small parameter.
in this way
schrodinger equation with two-component wave function was received which is
suitable in the weakly relativistic case. berestetskii and landau received this
equation by other method that diers from foldy-wouthuysen procedure [2].

however the weakly relativistic equation is not good for the particle which
moves with the speed very close to the speed of the light. had used foldy-
wouthuysen procedure the attempt to describe relativistic particle by two-
component wave function in the presence of a weak external electromagnetic

eld had been done in 1962 [3]. but in the [3] higher derivatives with re-
spect to potentials of the electromagnetic eld were neglected.
in 1995 [4]
landau-berestetskii method was used to separate the large and the small
components in the dirac equation for the spin 1/2 particle in the weak eld
approximation. but as for us this solution of the problem is not quite appre-
hensible.

in this paper foldy-wouthuysen procedure is used to construct schrodinger
equation with two-component wave function for relativistic electron in a weak
external electromagnetic eld. schrodinger equation for a relativistic spinless
particle in a weak external electromagnetic is also obtained. as in [3] and [5] we
take into account the contributions of the rst order by small parameter e but
we take also into account higher derivatives with respect to the eld potentials.
in the special case when we neglect higher orders derivatives we obtain result
[3], [5].
in [4] higher orders derivatives is taken into account also, but our
method and result diers from method and result [4].

2 relativistic spin-1/2 particle interaction with a

tion

foldy and wouthuysen showed how one could nd such representation where
the wave function of a free particle with respect to positive energy state is
spinor with the third and the fourth components equal to zero. spinor with
the rst and the second components equal to zero respond to the negative en-
ergy state.
in foldy-wouthuysen representation the rst two components of
the wave function are called large components and the second two compo-
nents are called small components. beside that, dirac hamiltonian has the
diagonal form in foldy-wouthuysen representation. it means that dirac equa-
tion can be written as the system of two equations. the rst equation of this
system contains only the large components and the second equation contains
only the small components. therefore one can separate large and small

components. the unitary operator makes transmission to foldy-wouthuysen
representation u0(p) :  = u0(p)

u0(p)u +

0 (p) = u +

0 (p)u0(p) = 1;

in this way dirac equation for the free particle will be the next

1

p2(p)((p) + mc2)(cid:16)(p) + mc2 + c~p(cid:17) .

u0(p) =

e = u0(p) hdu +

0 (p) = (p);

cle.

where (p) = pm2c4 + c2 p2 - the relativistic energy operator of the free parti-

the equation for dirac particle in the stationary electromagnetic eld is
obtained from equation (1) by well known substitution e  e  e, p  ~ =
p  e/c a

e = hc~~ + mc2 + ei .

in the presence of the external electromagnetic eld it is impossible to separate
large and the small components in the equation (8) by means of foldy-
wouthuysen procedure exactly. it is possible to do it approximately using a
perturbation theory with a small parameter. foldy and wouthuysen supposed
the inverted value of the light speed 1/c as the small parameter.
it means
that one considers the case when the particle energy is not very large. in our
work the value of the electron charge e is the small parameter. this value
characterises the electron interaction with the electromagnetic eld. therefore
we consider the case of the weak particle interaction with the eld and the
arbitrary particle energy. aiming to get the diagonal hamiltonian let us do
the unitary transformation in the equation (8) by means of the operator u (~) :
 = u (~).

the obtained hamiltonian is diagonal in the zeroth order in the constant of the
interaction. the rst order contains the diagonal part d and the nondiagonal

part nd. in order to exclude the nondiagonal part its necessary to manage
a unitary transformation ones again. after that we would obtain the diagonal
hamiltonian in the zeroth and in the rst orders. we also would obtain the
terms of the second order in the small parameter. those terms are small and
we do not take them into account.
in this way the large and the small
components can be separated in the equation for relativistic spin 1/2 particle
in the weak electromagnetic eld. but the separation of components can be
done by other method. in order to do it let us write operators d and nd in
the next form

d =

taking into the account that

we can write the equation (10) in the next form

e = (~~) + e + e ;

e = (~~) + e  e .

(17)

(18)

(19)

let us express the function  from the equation (19) in the case of the positive
energy, and the function  from the equation (18) in the case of the negative
energy

 = (e + (~~)  e)1e ,
 = (e  (~~)  e)1e ;

(20)

(21)

i. e.   e when e > 0, and   e when e < 0. after putting (20) into
the equation (18) and (21) into the equation (19) and neglecting the terms of
the second orders we get the approximate dirac equation in foldy-wouthuysen
representation

e  

 ! = h(~~) + e di  
 ! .

(22)

here the function  responds to the positive energy state and the function 
responds to the negative energy state.

4

if we neglect the contribution of the second order then the norm condition

of the wave function 

z +dv = z (+ + +)dv = 1;

can be written using only the function  in the case (e > 0)

z + dv = 1 .

(23)

(24)

therefore we can write two-component schrodinger equation for the relativistic
electron in the weak external electromagnetic eld

where

e = h ;

h =  (~~) + e.

(25)

(26)

from (26) it is easy to get pauli spin and weakly relativistic hamiltonians
[2]. for that one should expand (26) in series 1/c and take the terms of the
zeroth and the rst orders. therefore result (25) and (26) is a generalisations
of pauli spin equation and weakly relativistic equation.

it is also possible to manage weil transformation in the (22). weil trans-
formation for the operator a is function a(q, p), (a  a) which is determined
by the expression [5]

a(q, p) = z du e

ui ;

here |p  1
2 ui - is eigenvector of the impulse operator which responds to eigen-
2 u. if the operator a is the function which depends only on p or only
value p  1
on r then weil transformation is the same function which depends on p or q
respondly. weil transformation of the multiplication of two operator responds
expression which is determined by weil transformation of every operator. in
order to nd weil transformation for operator d which is determined by (11)
one should know weil transformation which responds to multiplication of three
operators. according to [5] the formula

a b c  exp( ih

2   (b)

p !)x,

ak,b,c,l

is true for the multiplication of three operators a(p), b(r), c(p) which act
on spinors and have weil transformation ak,(p), b,(r), c,l(p). let us write
weil transformation for the hamiltonian (22). the transmission formulas to
this representation contain higher derivatives with respect to the potentials of
the electromagnetic eld. if they are neglected then blount result is obtained

where b - bor magneton.

let us consider the operator a of dirac theory in foldy-wouthuysen repre-
sentation for the positive energy states. in dirac theory operator a act on four
component wave function. let us respond it operators which act only on large
components. if operator u au + is diagonal the matrix element h|u au +|i
can be written as

h|u au +|i + h|u au +|i

(28)

here

|i =   

0 ! ;

|i =   0

 ! .

the second term in the (28) is of the second order in small parameter e and
can be dropped down. therefore the operator of the dirac theory a should be
replaced by the projection of the operator u au + on the subspace of large
if the operator u au + is nondiagonal then the matrix element
components.
h|u au +|i can be written as

h|u au +|i + h|u au +|i .

here we can neglect nothing. but from expression (20) we can nd

therefore, from expressions (30) (29) the operator of dirac theory a should be
replaced by the projection of the operator

(32)

on the subspace of large components. in this place the remark must be done.
the operators (e + (p))1 and  in the expressions (29) and (30) should be
permuted. it can be done when we use fourier transformation to the potentials
of the eld. after that the value e should be replaced by the operator (p).

interaction of the relativistic spinless particle with
a weak electromagnetic eld

the problem of description of spinless particle in a weak electromagnetic eld
by one-component wave function with traditional norm condition is quite anal-
ogous to the description of dirac particle. that is why it is not necessary to
explain it in detail and we will write only the main results.

if external electromagnetic eld is absent we can separate the large and the
small components in the equation (34) using the transformation  = u0(p),
where

u0(p) =

1

2pmc2(p) (cid:16)(p) + mc2 + ((p)  mc2)(cid:17) .

in the presence of an external electromagnetic eld it is not possible to separate
large and small components in the equation (34) exactly. in order to make
it approximately let us use the operator u (~) = u0(~) for transmission to foldy-
wouthuysen representation. taking into account only values of the zeroth and
the rst order in small parameter e we get shrodinger equation which describe
a spinless particle in a electromagnetic eld

the wave function  is one component function and satisfy a traditional norm
condition

the hamiltonian (39) can be expend in series in small parameter 1/c. if we
took into account several rst contributions of this series we get the relativistic
corrections to hamiltonian of the nonrelativistic spinless particle [6].
