abstract

we discuss, in terms of the ads3-cft2 correspondence, a one-parameter family of

(asymptotically ads3) conical geometries which are generated by point masses and inter-

polate between ads3 and btz spacetimes. we show that these correspond to spectral
ow in n = (4, 4) scft2 which interpolate between ns and r sectors. our method
involves representing the conical spaces as solutions of three-dimensional supergravity
based on the supergroup su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2). the boundary cft we use is based on
the d1/d5 system. the correspondence includes comparing the euclidean free energies

between supergravity and scft for the family of conical spaces including btz black

holes.

introduction and summary

the recently conjectured adsd+1/cftd correspondence has led to a number of remarkable
predictions for n = 4 yang-mills theory in four dimensions. considering the fact that
such a correspondence potentially denes quantum gravity in these backgrounds, one

should be able to describe various interesting dynamical phenomena in gravity as well,

including, e.g. black hole formation. the case of d = 3 is particularly attractive because

both ads3 and cft2 are more tractable than their higher dimensional counterparts and

has nevertheless a rich physics content.

a particularly interesting class of solutions of three-dimensional gravity with  < 0 are

conical spacetimes [1] which are generated by a point mass at the origin (see equation (5)).

if the mass exceeds a certain critical value, the conical spacetime becomes a btz black

hole. indeed, it was observed by [4] peleg and steif that in the context of a gravitational

collapse of a shell of variable rest mass, the resulting spacetime is conical unless the rest

mass exceeds a critical value. at this value there is a critical phase transition and a btz

black hole is formed.

it was pointed out by brown and henneaux [2] that the conical spacetimes are asymp-

totically ads3 and they belong to the class of geometries whose asymptotic isometry
group is virasoro  virasoro. therefore it seems reasonable to expect, in the light of
ads/cft correspondence, that these spaces should correspond to boundary conformal

eld theories. it is already known [3] that the end-points of the one-parameter family

of metrics ( = 0, 1), namely the pure ads3 and the zero-mass btz black hole (see below
equation (8)), correspond to the ns and r sectors of a n = (1, 1) superconformal eld
theory (scft).

if we go back to the origin of the ads3-cft2 correspondence [6], namely to the near-
horizon limit of the d1/d5 system, the natural supersymmetry of the scft is n = (4, 4).
(this corresponds to a supergravity based on the group g = su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2) [9]).
in terms of such a scft, there is a natural interpolation between the ns and r sectors

called spectral ow [10]. it was conjectured some time back [12] that the conical spaces

should correspond to spectral ow, the defect angle being related to the parameter of the

ow (see equation (21)). one evidence was that the adm mass in supergravity matched

2

exactly with l0 + l0 in the scft (see equation (26)) for all values of the interpolating
parameter. this connection has also been mentioned recently in [13].

in incorporating conical spaces in the ambit of ads3-cft2 correspondence, the rst

step is to realize the conical spaces as supersymmetric solutions of three-dimensional

gravity, since the boundary theory mentioned above is supersymmetric. if one tries to

generalize to conical spaces the work of [3] which embeds btz and ads3 in the framework
of (1,1)-type1 ads3, the conical spaces turn out to be non-supersymmetric: the killing

spinors, in particular, are quasiperiodic and hence not globally dened. if, however, one
tries to realize these as solutions of su(1, 1|2) su(1, 1|2) supergravity, which is natural
from the viewpoint of the boundary theory, the killing spinors become globally dened.

this construction also allows us to establish the main point of the bulk-to-boundary

correspondence in this case: since the same supergroup is represented in the bulk theory

and in the boundary theory, we can nd the operator in the supergroup which deforms

the value of the spectral parameter in the scft and the operator which changes the

value of the defect angle in the supergravity. we nd that the same operator causes

the one-parameter ow in both cases, thus establishing the correspondence between the

spectral ow and conical spaces.

as additional evidence for this correspondence we compute the euclidean free energy

of the family of spacetimes and compare with the corresponding quantity in scft. the

btz free energy, which has already been discussed in [16, 17], is shown to be reproduced
by scft based on the symmetric product sq1q5(t 4) at high temperatures. the free

energies of the conics are reproduced at low temperatures.

as an o-shoot of our construction we nd a vertex operator in the scft which

corresponds to creation of a point mass geometry in an asymptotically ads3 space. the

scattering of such point masses (including the cases when they form a black hole [5]) is

naturally represented in terms of correlation function of such vertex operators.

this paper is organized as follows.

in section 2, we discuss the conical spaces as
solutions of three-dimensional supergravity (with  < 0) based on g = su(1, 1|2) 
su(1, 1|2). in section 3 we make the identication with spectral ow in n = (4, 4) scft.
1for the denition of (p, q)-type ads3 supergravity, please see [21]. note the dierence with the
notation n = (p, q) which represents the number of supersymmetries in the left- and right-moving
sectors respectively of the scft.

3

in section 4 we compute the euclidean free energies of these spaces from supergravity. in

section 5 we compute the free energies from the scft viewpoint and compare with the

results of section 4. in the concluding section (sec. 6) we discuss the issue of scattering of

the point masses and black hole formation in terms of correlation functions in the scft.

2 conical spaces as solutions of supergravity based on g

the action for three-dimensional supergravity (with cosmological constant  < 0) based
on g  su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2) is as follows [14, 15]:

the same three-dimensional supergravity can be obtained from type iib string theory
compactied on k = t 4  s3 (with constant ux on s3). recall that the near-horizon
geometry of the d1/d5 system involves kads3 whose (super)isometries are g. similarly
the near-horizon geometry of the ve-dimensional black hole is k btz [16]. this implies
in an obvious fashion that ads3 and btz are solutions of (1). furthermore, the three-
dimensional newtons constant g(3)

n and the ads radius l are given by the following string

theoretic expressions:

where v4 is the volume of t 4 and gs is the string coupling (we are working in the units

conical spaces

as mentioned in the introduction, there is a one-parameter family of classical solutions

of three-dimensional gravity (with  < 0) discovered by deser and jackiw which are

asymptotically ads3 and interpolate between the ads3 and zero-mass btz solutions.
these represent geometries around a point mass m, 0 < m < 1/(4g(3)

n ) which create a

conical singularity at the origin. the metric is given by

ds2 = dt2( +

r2
l2 ) + dr2( +

r2
l2 )1 + r2d2,

(3)

it is easy to see that there is a conical singularity at the origin r = 0 with defect angle

the parameter  varies from 0 to 1, and is related to the point mass m at the origin:

 = 2(1  )

m =

1  
4g(3)
n

(4)

(5)

we will denote these spaces by x. note that the mass m is the deserjackiw mass which

is dierent from the btz denition of mass, denoted by m, which is given by

m = /(8g(3)
n )

btz and ads3 as end-points:

recall that the metric of pure ads3 is given by

ds2 = dt2(1 +

r2
l2 ) + dr2(1 +

r2
l2 )1 + r2d2

while the metric for btz black holes is given by

j
2r

j

dr2 + r2(j

2r2 dt + d)2

(6)

(7)

(8)

where m and j refer to the mass and the angular momentum of the btz black hole
(j  m).

it is clear that the space x becomes ads3 for  = 1, whereas for  = 0 it becomes

btz with m = 0 (m = 0  j = 0).

5

we have already remarked that ads3 and btz are supersymmetric solutions of (1).

we will now show that the entire family of spaces x can be obtained as supersymmetric

solutions of (1).

it is known [19]2 how to embed the conical spaces (3) as supersymmetric solutions in

(2, 0)-type ads3 supergravity. the solution looks like:

adx = 

l
2

d

where a is the u(1) gauge eld appearing in the graviton supermultiplet.

the embedding into n = (4, 4) is a straightforward extension of the above:

dx = 
a3

l
2

d, a dx = 0

(9)

(10)

where the superscripts 3, refer to the r-parity group su(2).

it can be explicitly checked that the equations of motion following from (1), as well as

the killing spinor equations ensuring supersymmetry are satised by the above solution.

the equations of motion reduce to those of the u(1) problem [19] with the ansatz (10). as

far as the killing spinors are concerned, the solution in our case is a doublet constructed

out of the solution of the u(1) problem. the killing spinor equation in the present case

is

where 1 is the complex conjugate of 1, the latter being the killing spinor in the u(1)
problem [19].

connection with (1, 1)-type ads3 supergravity:

we emphasize that extended supersymmetry is quite essential to construct the conical

spaces as supersymmetric solutions. the killing spinors have holonomies under both the

spin connection and the gauge connection. under either one of them the spinors are

2we thank p.townsend for pointing out reference [19] to us.

quasiperiodic, corresponding to the fact that the (1, 1)-type killing spinors constructed

using the formulae of [3], which see only the spin connection, are quasiperiodic. with

extended supersymmetry (i.e., (p, q)-type ads3 supergravity, with either p or q or both

greater than 1) there is a u(1) gauge eld. the holonomy under this gauge connection

cancels that under the spin connection, making the killing spinors periodic and hence

globally dened. the ns or r boundary conditions of the spinors of [3] for  = 1, 0 now

refer to the condition that the holonomy under the gauge connection, represented by the

wilson line

is 1 or 1 respectively.

w = tr exp[

i

lz adx],

(13)

conics as one-parameter family of gauge transforms

it is clear from the above discussion that the family of solutions can be parameterized
uniquely by the value of the wilson line w (the metric is xed once we specify this).
we can, therefore, change from the classical solution x=0 to x by making a gauge

transformation

a  u1au + iu1u, u(t, r, ) = exp[i()t 3],

() = 

(14)

the reason why the wilson line w changes is that u is not single-valued. in other words,
(14) describes an improper gauge transformation.

the equations of motion demand that the metric changes appropriately from its value

at  = 0 to the value at . it is interesting to note that this change in the metric can also be
understood as an (improper) sl(2, r)sl(2, r) gauge transformation. following [20, 21]
we combine the dribein em
n  into an sl(2, r)sl(2, r) vector
potential a. for the metric (3), it turns out to be

as emphasized before, the gauge transformation of the metric can be regarded as a

consequence of the gauge transformation (14) and the equations of motion. for compari-

son with the boundary cft, we note that the gauge transformation (14) is implemented

in the quantum theory by the operator

bu = exp[icj3]

where cja, a = 1, 2, 3 are generators of the su(2) part of su(1, 1|2).

3 correspondence with spectral ow

(17)

we have already remarked that the brown-henneaux virasoro algabra can be supersym-
metrized [3] by embedding the ads3 or btz solutions in n = 1 supergravity, and that
the realizations of the superconformal algebra corresponding to the ads3 and btz solu-

tions respectively map to the ns and r sector of the boundary conformal eld theory.

in the context of extended supersymmetry, as we have remarked above, the ads3 and
btz solutions correspond to a wilson line w equal to 1 or 1. in order to facilitate
comparison, let us dene the gauge-invariantized fermion

  u[a], u[a] = exp[

i

lz p

p0

a]

(18)

the ads3 and btz solution correspond to antiperiodic or periodic  respectively. it is
this  of supergravity that maps to the fermion  of cft.

now, we know that there is a one-parameter ow, called spectral ow, between periodic
and antiperiodic boundary conditions in the case of n = 4 superconformal theory [10].
this corresponds to quasiperiodic boundary condition on :

(ze2i) = exp(i)(z)

(19)

8

let us compare this ow with the one-parameter ow caused by the wilson line (eqs. (14)
and (17)). we note that the gauge-invariantized fermion  satises, under    + 2
(20)

(ze2i, r  ) = exp(i) (z)

where z = ei(t+). this suggests that the hilbert space corresponding to spectral ow is

the realization of boundary scft for the conical spaces, with the identication

 = 

(21)

the fact that this is the right correspondence follows by noting that spectral ow in the

scft is dened in terms of the generator [10, 11]

bu = exp[icj3]

where cj3 is the su(2) r-parity current. thus the su(2) generator for spectral ow (22)

is the same as the su(2) generator (17) in the bulk that changes the conical defect angle.

this is exactly as it should be for the proposed ads/cft correspondence to work.

the equality of (17) and (22) under the ads/cft correspondence proves our assertion.

a rather important consequence of the above correspondence is that we know exactly

what state in the cft corresponds to a point mass in the bulk that creates the conical

singularity, namely it is the state

(22)

(23)

|i  bu|0i,

this suggests a boundary representation in terms of cft vertex operators of a point

mass in the bulk and consequently a representation of their scattering in terms of cft

correlation in the sense of [7, 8]. we will make some more remarks on this in the concluding

section. related remarks also appear in [24] in a somewhat dierent context.

we note that we are parameterizing the ow in supergravity by the wilson line only,

by adopting the attitude that the metric gets xed as a consequence of the equation of

motion. for example, the adm mass for the metric corresponding to the wilson line (10)

is

the counterart of this statement in cft is that by performing a spectral ow along j 3

we automatically change the value of l0 on the ground state from 0 to

m = /8g(3)

n

(24)

l0 = 

c
24

2

9

(25)

similar remarks apply to l0. using (2) and the fact that c = 6q1q5 (see section 5) for
the ads3 and btz points, it is easy to see that

m =

l0 + l0

l

.

(26)

we see that (24) and (25) agree with (26) if we use  = 2, which is the same condition

as in eqn. (21). this provides additional support to our proposed correspondence. this

matching has recently also been mentioned in [13].

we will continue to explore this correspondence in the rest of the paper in the context

of the euclidean free energy.

4 the euclidean free energy of asymptotically ads3 solutions

in this section we will compute the euclidean free energy of conical spaces (also of ads3

and btz) following the method of gibbons and hawking [22]. let us recall that the free

energy is given by

z  exp[f ()] =z d[elds] exp[s]

(27)

where s is now the euclidean version of the action written in (1).

boundary conditions:

in the above equation,  denotes boundary conditions on the elds. as noted in [16],
the boundary (corresponding to r  ) is t 2, coordinatized by  and the euclidean time
  it, with appropriate identications. for the ads3 solution, the identications are
(28)

(, )  ( + ,  + 2)

where  denotes inverse temperature and is arbitrary. for the btz solution (with mass m

and euclidean angular momentum je = ij) the identications are (dictated by smooth-

ness of metric)

where 0 and  are given by

(, )  ( + 0,  + )

in anticipation we note that implication of the identications is that the boundary geom-

etry is that of a torus with the modular parameter proportional to 0 + i. therefore the

partition function of the dual cft need to be evaluated on the torus with the modular

parameter proportional to 0 + i. the boundary condition on the elds is that the

bosonic elds must have the same values at identied points whereas the fermion elds

must have the same value upto a sign (periodic (p) or antiperiodic (a)). since we are

talking about identications on a two-torus, the fermion boundary conditions can be

 = (p, p ), (p, a), (a, p ), (a, a)

(31)

where the rst entry denotes boundary condition in the  direction and the second entry

denotes boundary condition along the  direction.

for the conical spaces, the identication is the same as for ads3, except that the

specication of the functional integral includes the wilson line (equation (10)) as a part

of the boundary condition.

saddle points

we will evaluate (27) by nding saddle points of the action subject to specic boundary

conditions. these are euclidean versions of the classical solutions that we have described
in the previous section. by virtue of the equation of motion r = 6/l2, the euclidean
action s of a classical spacetime x is simply its volume times a constant. to be precise,

s(x) =

vol(x) = z

the ranges of ,  follow from the identications mentioned above. the lower limit r0

of the r-integral is identically zero for ads3 and the conical spaces, whereas for btz

it denotes the location of the horizon (the euclidean section is dened only upto the

horizon). the upper limit r is kept as an infrared regulator to make the volume nite.

we will in practice only be interested in free energies relative to ads3 and the r-dependent

divergent term will disappear from that calculation.

free energy of btz:

we will now compute the free energy of btz relative to ads3. the ads3 solution can

be at any temperature  while the temperature of the black hole is xed to be 0. to

compare with the ads3 background one must adjust  so that the geometries of the two

manifolds match at the hypersurface of radius r (in other words, we must use the same

infrared regulator on all saddle points of the functional integral). this gives the following

relation

0 = vuut

substituting the value of 0 in terms of  and taking the limit r   we obtain

s(bt z)  s(ads3) =

for convenience let us dene the left and right temperatures [16] as

it is easily seen that the btz black hole dominates when (1/+ + 1/) is much larger

once again,  is determined in terms of  by the requirement that the hypersurface

in the next section we will compare with the free energy computed from the boundary

spacetime the btz black hole with j = m = 0 (which is simply the space x0, also

denoted btz0):

5 the partition function from the cft

the aim of this section is to calculate the partition function of the (4, 4) cft on the
orbifold t 4q1q5/s(q1q5). the partition function will depend of the boundary conditions

of the fermions of the cft. dierent bulk geometries will induce dierent boundary

conditions for the fermions of the cft. we will rst calculate the partition function

when the bulk geometry is that of the btz black hole.

cft partition function corresponding to btz

the fermions of the cft are periodic along the angular coordinate of the cylinder if

the bulk geometry is that of the btz black hole. this can be seen by observing that

the zero mass btz black hole admits killing vectors which are periodic along the angular

coordinate [3]. therefore the zero mass btz black hole correspond to the ramond sector

of the cft. the general case of the btz black hole with mass and angular momentum

correspond to excited states of the cft over the ramond vacuum with

l0 + l0 = ml
l0  l0 = je

(45)

where m and je are the mass and the (euclidean) angular momentum of the btz black

hole. therefore the partition function of the btz black hole should correspond to

z = trr(e2i l0e2i l0)

(46)

the hilbert space of the cft on the orbifold t 4q1q5/s(q1q5) can be decomposed into

twisted sectors labeled by the conjugacy classes of the permutation group s(q1q5). the

conjugacy classes of the permutation group consists of cyclic groups of various lengths.

the various conjugacy classes and the multiplicity in which they occur in s(q1q5) can

be found from the solutions of the equation

q1q5xn=0

nnn = q1q5

(47)

where n is the length of the cycle and nn is the multiplicity of the cycle. the hilbert

14

space is given by

h = mp nnn=q1q5on>0

snnhpn

(n)

(48)

snh denotes the symmetrized product of the hilbert space h, n times. by the symbol
hpn
(n) we mean the hilbert space of the twisted sector with a cycle of length n in which
only states which are invariant under the projection operator

pn =

1
n

nxk=1

e2ik(l0 l0)

(49)

are retained. the values of l0 or l0 in the twisted sector of length n is of the form p/n
where p is positive integer. this projection forces the value of l0  l0 to be an integer
on the twisted sector. it arises because the black hole can exchange only integer valued

kaluza-klein momentum with the bulk [18].

the dominant contribution to the partition function arises from the maximally twisted

sector. that is, from the longest single cycle of length q1q5. it is given by

z =xm,n

d(q1q5n + m)d(m)e2in e2im /q1q5e2im /q1q5

(50)

where ds are the coecients dened by the expansion

3( ) #2
zt 4 ="2(0|

d(n)e2i n

(51)

in the above equation zt 4 is the partition function of the holomorphic sector of the cft
on t 4. we will rst evaluate the sum

p (m,  ) =

d(q1q5n + m)e2in

for large values of q1q5 we can use the asymptotic form of d(q1q5n + m)

d(q1q5n + m)  exp(cid:18)2qq1q5n + m(cid:19)

(52)

(53)

substituting the above value of d(q1q5n + m) in p (m,  ) we obtain a sum which has an

integral representation as shown below.

p (m,  ) =

where p denotes principal value of the integral.

we are interested in the high temperature limit of the partition function. the leading

contribution to the integral in the limit   0 is

p (m,  ) qiq1q5/ eiq1q5/2i2m /q1q5

substituting the above value of p (m,  ) the partition function becomes

(55)

z =qiq1q5/

xm=0

d(m)e2im /q1q5  exp (iq1q5(1/2  1/2))

(56)

thus the free energy at high temperatures is given by

 ln z = iq1q5

this exactly agrees with (39) with the identication  = i+/(2l).

cft partition function corresponding to conical spaces

we will focus on the low temperature (large ) behaviour. at low temperature, using

 = i/(2l) ( real in this case), the partition function is given by

z  tr exp[2i l0  2i l0)] = exp[(e0 + e0)](1 + o(exp[]))

(58)

where e0, e0 represent the ground state values of l0, l0, and  represents the excitation
energy of the rst excited level. according to our proposal, the boundary cft for conical

spaces corresponds to the hilbert space of spectral ow satisfying the relation (21). by

using (25) and (26), we nd that

 ln z =

(e0 + e0)

(59)

which agrees exactly with (44) (note that for the zero-mass btz solution the above

expression vanishes).

6 concluding remarks

we have argued that point mass geometries in three dimensional quantum gravity with

negative cosmological constant are part of the phenomenon of ads/cft correspondence.

16

the boundary cft corresponds to spectral ow with the spectral ow parameter identi-

ed appropriately with the point mass, or equivalently ((21)) with the defect angle of the

conical singularity.

the above identication also leads to a correspondence between vertex operators of the

boundary cft with states in the bulk that corresponds to the point mass, thus leading

to a possible description of scattering of such point masses in terms of cft correlations.

in this context it would be very useful to connect with the work of steif [5] where multi-

point-mass classical solutions were discussed. in particular, the spatial geometry of such

solutions were obtained by quotienting two dimensional hyperbolic space by appropriate

sub-groups of sl(2, r). for example, quotienting by sub-groups that generate elliptic

isometries gives rise to point particles, while those with hyperbolic isometries lead to

black holes.

the interesting thing about these multi-body solutions is that they are generally not

static, and therefore can be used to study black hole formation by collision of point

particles, or more complicated processes like collisions of black holes. in the light of the

ads/cft correspondence, it would be interesting to know how such processes manifest

themselves in the cft picture. more precisely, what eect does quotienting the spatial

slice have on the cft? we have found a hint to this answer in this paper, for the simple

case of a single point particle: it corresponds to a certain vertex operator in the scft

(representation of a point mass in the bulk as vertex operator in a boundary liouville

theory has been discussed recently in [23]). the understanding of more general quotients

holds the promise of providing insights into some very interesting processes in (2+1)

dimensional gravity.

another interesting point to emerge in this paper is that the partition function of

the dual cft agrees exactly with that of the supergravity at high temperatures. this is

remarkable as the partition function of the cft was computed in weak coupling and the

supergravity result is expected to be a prediction for the cft result at strong coupling.

note that this agreement works for arbitrary angular momentum, in particular for j = 0

which is far from extremality and hence is far from the bps limit.
