abstract

a eld theoretical framework for the recently proposed photon
condensation eect in a nonlinear fabry-perot cavity is discussed. the
dynamics of the photon gas turns out to be described by an eective
2d hamiltonian of a complex massive scalar eld. finite size eects
turn out to be relevant for the existence of the photon condensate.

1 introduction

this work originates from a very recent experimental proposal [1] in order
to detect a bose-einstein condensation and a new superuid state of light.
the apparatus [1] consists basically of a planar fabry-perot cavity lled with
a nonlinear polarizable medium responsible for an eective repulsive short-
range four-photon interaction. the mirrors of the cavity have a low but nite
transmittivity, allowing photons of an incident laser beam to enter and leave
the cavity, so that a steady-state condition is achieved after many photon-
photon collisions. following [1], the weak interaction between the photons
can be viewed as a four-photon term arising from a repulsive pairwise in-
teraction provided by a self-defocusing kerr nonlinear medium inside the
fabry-perot cavity [2]. moreover, due to the boundary conditions required
by the fabry-perot, one is led with an eective two-dimensional nonrela-
tivistic massive weakly-interacting photon gas conned in the cavity. the
nonrelativistic regime is due to the paraxial propagation of the light inside
the resonator [1, 2]. this eective 2d weakly-interacting photon gas displays
a bogoliubov type dispersion relation, suggesting the existence of a bose-
einstein photon condensate and of a possible superuid state of light.
in
particular, one of the tasks of the experiment is to investigate the existence
of the sound-like waves corresponding to the collective phonon excitations
in the photon superuid, which, according to [1], should propagate with a
velocity whose value vc is a few thousandths of the vacuum speed of light,
vc = 4.2  107cm/s. a follow-up experiment is being planned [1] in order
to demonstrate that the sound wave velocity vc is a critical velocity for the
photon (super)uid, corresponding to the existence of persistent currents.

it is useful now to spend a few words on the meaning of the bose-einstein
condensation for this 2d photon gas, as is well known that there are quite
severe restrictions on the existence of a bose-einstein condensation in mo-
mentum space for a weakly-interacting 2d gas in the thermodynamic limit
for any nonvanishing temperature [3, 4, 5].
we underline rst of all that the system realized by the experimental set-
up of [1] is a zero-temperature bose gas. we know that for an ideal bose
gas a macroscopic number n0 of particles will condense occupying the zero-

1

momentum state; however the presence of interactions could strongly modify
this picture, in such a way that the presence of the condensate is no longer so
obvious [6, 7]. nevertheless, in our case the interaction is very weak, and we
may think that n0 remains a macroscopic number. moreover, the presence
of a nonvanishing interaction is crucial in order to imply a redenition of
the spectrum of the excitations which gives rise to the bogoliubov dispersion
relation.
another remarkable issue is the fact that the photon gas ought to be consid-
ered here as a genuine nite-sized system, as the whole apparatus possesses
a nite small volume (i.e. the cavity volume) and the average number n
of photons inside the cavity is kept nite as well. also, the fabry-perot
boundary conditions play a crucial role in order to provide an eective mass
for the photons [1], which turns out to be proportional to the inverse of the
separation length l between the mirrors of the cavity. the situation looks
very close to that of trapped bose gases [8, 9, 10], for which the bose-einstein
condensation has been observed even in the case of 1d dimensionally reduced
systems [13, 11]. for these inhomogeneous nite-sized systems the existence
of a bose-einstein condensation is not, strictly speaking, a phase transition
[11, 12, 4, 5]. rather, it is a direct consequence of the experimental evidence
[8, 9, 10, 11] of a macroscopic occupation of the lowest state. it is worth
remarking that the number n0 of photons occupying the lowest state has
been estimated [1] to be of the order of n0 = 8  1011.
the aim of the present work is to propose and analyse a possible theoret-
ical set up. we shall be able to show that the eective 2d weakly-interacting
massive photon gas can be actually obtained by a four-photon qed-inspired
hamiltonian, once the gauge freedom and the fabry-perot boundary condi-
tions have been properly taken into account.

2 the eective hamiltonian

as the starting qed-inspired eective hamiltonian describing a weak repul-
sive four-photon interaction we take the following gauge invariant expression

he =zv

v being the volume1 of the fabry-perot cavity. the coupling constant  is
positive and at
 stand for the transverse gauge invariant components of the
gauge eld, i.e.

at
 = (g 


2 )a =

1
2 f ,

where g = diag(+,,,) is the at minkowski metric and

f = a  a .

(2.2)

(2.3)

in order to motivate the choice of the hamiltonian (2.1) we underline that,
according to [2], the eld propagation inside the cavity in the paraxial ap-
proximation is described by a nonlinear schrodinger equation. the eective
hamiltonian (2.1) can then be obtained by requiring that the heisenberg
equations of motion for the eld reproduce the nonlinear schrodinger equa-
tion in the semiclassical limit [2].

although not needed, it is worth remarking that expression (2.1) can
be immediately generalized in a gauge invariant way to a typical two-body
interaction, namely

he =zv
for some short-range repulsive potential u(x  y).
being interested in the analysis of the ground state of the hamiltonian
(2.1), we shall work in the static situation in which all elds are assumed
to be time-independent. accordingly, we shall make use of the so called
temporal gauge

(2.4)

a0 = 0 ,
a = a (x ) ,

(2.5)

which implies

1as we shall see in the next section, the boundary conditions required by the fabry-

perot cavity do allow for usual integration by parts.

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

obviously, expression (2.8) is left invariant by the time-independent gauge
transformations, i.e.

ai = i(x ) .

(2.9)

this spatial type of gauge invariance can be xed by imposing the axial gauge
condition

a3(x ) = 0 ,

(2.10)

naturally suggested by the geometry of the fabry-perot cavity. here the
z-axis is chosen to be coincident with the direction of propagation of the
laser beam incident on the fabry-perot. the mirrors of the cavity lie in the
transverse xy plane.
however, as is well known, condition (2.10) does not x completely the gauge
freedom and allows for a further residual local invariance, corresponding to
the gauge transformations on the plane xy ortogonal to the z-axis. in fact,
owing to the equation (2.10) , for the eld strength fij we get

fa3 = 3aa ,
fab = aab  baa ,

a, b = 1, 2 .

(2.11)

it is apparent then that the components of fij are left invariant by the
following z-independent transformations

(2.12)
where x  = (x, y). this further residual gauge invariance (2.12) can be
xed by requiring the additional condition

aa = a(x) ,

aaa = 0 ,

(2.13)

from which it follows that the two gauge elds aa can be identied with their
transverse components. finally, for the fully gauge xed eective hamilto-
nian we obtain

the starting point for the analysis of the spectrum of the excitations of the
weakly coupled photon gas.

3 the spectrum of the excitations

in order to analyse the spectrum of the hamiltonian (2.14), we have rst to
properly take into account the boundary conditions of the problem. these
require the vanishing of the elds at the reecting surfaces of the mirrors of
the fabry-perot cavity, i.e.

aa(x, z) =

1

l eaa(x) sin(


l

n0z) ,

(3.15)

where l is the distance between the mirrors and where the xed integer n0 is
related to the frequency  of the laser beam incident on the cavity through
n0/l = . it should be pointed out that the form of the eld (3.15) requires
the assumption that the spacing between the modes of the cavity is so large
that only one longitudinal mode is excited by the laser beam [2]. concerning
now the xy plane, periodic boundary conditions will be assumed.

5

inserting equation (3.15) in the expression (2.14) and performing the
integration over the z-axis, we easily get the following 2d dimensionally
reduced eective hamiltonian

(3.16)

where m = n0/l =  is the eective mass of the photon gas conned in the
fabry-perot cavity. it is worth mentioning that the paraxial approximation
guarantees that the photons have a nite eective mass also when tunneling
eects due to the low but nite transmittivity of the mirrors are taken into
account [1]. setting

ea1 = ( + ) ,
ea2 = i(  ) ,

we obtain the nal form of the four-photon hamiltonian

describing an eective weakly-interacting massive 2d photon gas. this hamil-
tonian displays a u(1) global phase symmetry, which follows from the o(2)
rotational invariance in the xy plane of the dimensionally reduced 2d eec-
tive hamiltonian (3.16). moreover, for a paraxial propagation of the light
2  m, so that the photon gas is
in fact nonrelativistic. in order to obtain the spectrum of the hamiltonian
we expand the elds ,  in fourier modes

(3.21)

of course, expression (3.20) is nothing but the starting hamiltonian of [1].
now we can proceed with the standard analysis of the weakly-interacting
bose gas within the bogoliubov approximation [1, 12]. assuming that the
number n0 of excitations occupying the zero-momentum state is macro-
scopic2, i.e. n0  1, and neglecting higher order interaction terms above the
condensate, the hamiltonian (3.20) is diagonalized by means of a bogoliubov
transformation

expression (3.24) provides a nonvanishing critical velocity for the phonon
sound-like waves

2we recall here that n0 is of the order of 8  1011, so that the condition n0  1 is in

fact veried.

4 conclusion

in this work we have derived a possible theoretical set up for the photon con-
densation eect proposed in [1], starting from a nonlinear qedinspired
hamiltonian. in particular, we have shown that the dynamics of the photon
gas inside the fabry-perot cavity lled with a nonlinear polarizable medium
is described in terms of a 2d dimensionally reduced eective hamiltonian
of a massive complex scalar eld. this implies that the transverse dimen-
sions of the cavity should play a crucial role in the photon condensation. in
fact, according to our eld theory description, if one takes as possible ther-
modynamic limit3 n, a  , n/a =const., the lowest lying phonon of the
bogoliubov spectrum would play the role of the goldstone boson correspond-
ing to the spontaneous breaking of the u(1) symmetry of the hamiltonian

3we remind that a is the available area of the cavity in the transverse plane xy.

8

(3.18). however, it is well known that spontaneous symmetry breaking can-
not take place in two-dimensions, due to the infrared divergencies associated
to massless scalar elds [14].

therefore, as in the case of trapped bose gases, the photon gas has to be
considered as a genuine nite-sized system, the transverse dimensions of the
cavity providing a natural infrared cut-o4.

thus, we expect that these nite size conditions should be actually real-
ized in the experimental framework in order to observe the photon conden-
sate. the role played by the niteness of the system is under investigation.
in this context, it would be also very interesting to study the possibility of
the existence of a kosterlitz-thouless phase transition for the 2d photon
(super)uid.
