abstract

we discuss the conditions under which 4d gravity is localized on domain walls in 5d anti
de sitter spaces. our approach is based on considering the limits in which the localized
gravity decouples. we nd that gravity is localized if the wall is located a nite distance
from the boundary of the antide sitter space and has a nite tension. in addition, it has
to be a function source of gravity.

1 introduction

the only consistent theory of quantum gravity is superstring theory which lives in ten
dimensions. traditionally the extra six dimensions are compactied on a manifold of
string or planck size in order to render them unobservable. four dimensional gravity is
obtained from ten dimensional gravity by dimensional reduction on the small six manifold.
recently, two interesting modications to this scenario have been investigated. on one
hand, the existence of dbranes in string theory with only super yangmills (sym)
interactions on their worldvolume was discovered. the sym theory arises from the low
energy physics of the open strings which live on the branes. gravity does not propagate
on dbranes but only in the bulk of space which surrounds them. on the other hand, it
was noticed that the internal compact six dimensional manifold does not have to be string
or planck scale if only gravity can propagate in the bulk. in fact, present day limits on
newtons law can be accomodated with two or more rather large dimensions of micron to
milimeter size[1]. in this case, the weakness of gravity relative to the gauge interactions
is a result of the large compact dimensions.

more recently, it was argued that there is no need to compactify extra dimensions at
[2] it was shown that gravity can
all in order to get four dimensional gravity.
be localized on domain walls in antide sitter (ads) space.
in this manner, one can
eliminate compactication with all its wellknown problems like moduli, stability etc.
at rst sight this seems to contradict the wellknown adscft duality which relates a
bulk gravitational theory to a boundary eld theory. in particular on the boundary of
the ads space there is no gravity. this work arose from trying to clarify this apparent
contradiction.

in ref.

in this letter, we nd the necessary conditions for localization of gravity on domain
walls in ads space. in the following, we will use the terms brane or domain wall inter-
changably. the branes in this language do not necessarily refer to dbranes of string
theory. we analyze the conditions under which the four dimensional gravity decouples
and interpret the absence of these conditions as the necessary conditions for localization
of gravity. we nd that gravity is localized on branes in ads space if the brane is a
nite distance away from the boundary of the ads space and has a nite tension. it is
also crucial for the brane to contribute to the stressenergy tensor as a function source
as for domain walls in supergravity. these are the conditions that seem necessary for
localizing gravity on the brane worldvolume. the reason is related to the nonnormal-
izable bulk graviton modes in ads space. in pure ads space there is no gravity on the
boundary since the nonnormalizable graviton modes cannot be excited there. however,
in the presence of a brane and under the above conditions these modes are eliminated.
the new space with the brane at its boundary is not ads but a truncated version of it
which is symmetrical on both sides of the brane. as a result, gravity can propagate on
the boundary of the new space given by the brane worldvolume. the above also applies
to more general cases such as intersections of branes in higher dimensional spaces[3, 4].

1

recently, there have been a number of papers investigating dierent aspects of this and
related scenarios[5]-[9].

the letter is organized as follows. in the next section we review the solution for the 3
brane in ads5 and localization of gravity in four dimensions. in section 3 we show that 4d
gravity decouples in certain limits. the absence of these are interpreted as the necessary
conditions for localized gravity. section 4 includes are conclusions and a discussion of our
results.

2 localized gravity on branes

we begin by reviewing the solution for a 3d domain wall in ads5 located a nite distance
away from the boundary of ads5. in this conguration the ve dimensional graviton has
a massless normalizable zero mode on the worldvolume of the brane[2],[3]. therefore
gravity is localized or trapped in four dimensions. consider a 3d domain wall in ads5 a
nite distance from the boundary. we assume that the brane couples only gravitationally
to the 5d bulk theory. the action specifying the dynamics of the brane-bulk system is

s = zm

where the bulk cosmological constant, , is negative (since the bulk is ads5), the brane
tension  is positive and 2
5 where m5 is the fundamental mass scale of the bulk
theory.

5 = 8/m 3

the equations of motion which follow from (3) are

(2)

where the stress-energy tensor is a combination of the domain wall situated at z = l and
the ads5 bulk terms. note that the wall contribution is given by a function in the z
direction which cuts all bulk gravitational modes on the wall. we are looking for solutions
to the above equations which reect the symmetries of the 3-brane, i.e. 3 + 1 dimensional
lorentz symmetry. the solution is given by (in poincare coordinates, in terms of the
shifted coordinate z = z + l)[2],[3]

ds2

5 =

l2

(|z| + l)2 (dxdx + dz2)

(3)

here l is related to the bulk cosmological constant and m5 by l2 = 6/2
5 and l is the
distance of the brane to the boundary of ads5. this is similar to but not quite ads5 due
to the absolute value sign and the nonzero distance l. in fact, in this metric the portion
of ads5 from the brane to the boundary is deleted and the bulk geometry is symmetric

2

on both sides of the brane due to the absolute value sign. the dierence between this
space and ads5 are essential for localization of gravity on its boundary, i.e. the brane
worldvolume. the metric in eq.
(3) is a solution of einsteins equations only if the
tension of the wall is ne tuned to be  = 62

5l2/l3.

in order to show that gravity is localized on the brane we solve the equation of motion

for the linearized graviton in the above background

where

(5)

and h = (z)3/2h with (z) = l/(|z| + l).

the massless four dimensional mode of the graviton is obtained by setting h(x, z) =

eipx(z) and solving the eective schrodinger equation

(cid:18)

z + v (z)(cid:19)  =

(6)

where  labels the eigenfunctions. this potential has a repulsive piece which goes to zero
for |z|  l, and an attractive  function. the 4d massless graviton corresponds to a
bound state with the wavefunction

(z) = s l2

l3 (z)3/2.

in this case, the 4d gravitational action is given by

s = m 3

5 z dz3 z d4xqg(4)r(4)

thus, the four dimensional graviton couples with the strength

m 2

p = m 3

5 z dz3 =

(9)

the result for mp is identical to the case in which 5d gravity is compactied on a circle
of size l3/l2. it can also be shown that gravity behaves as if it is four dimensional down
to distances  l3/l2 whereas for shorter distances it becomes the higher dimensional bulk
gravity[3]. we see that gravity behaves as if it is compactied on a circle whereas in
reality the fth dimension is innite.

as long as l 6= 0 i.e. the brane is not on the boundary of ads5 all values of l give
equivalent but dierent solutions. this can be seen from the tranformation x  x, z 
1z which is a broken symmetry (by the nonzero value of l) of the solution in eq. (3).

3

this transformation takes l  l/ which corresponds to a new solution. dierent values
of l are superselection sectors of the theory since the brane worldvolume is innite. if
we want we can conveniently choose  so that l/ = l in which case the metric becomes
that of ref. [2]. (in the following we assume that l 6= l in order to clarify the role of the
distance to the boundary l.) this symmetry is closely related to the wellknown scaling
radial translation equivalence of the adscft duality. in that context, it is known that
a scale transformation on the boundary is equivalent to a radial displacement in the bulk.
this is precisely the transformation we considered above.

3 decoupling localized gravity

in this section we nd the necessary conditions for localizing bulk gravity on a lower
dimensional brane worldvolume. we only consider 3branes in bulk ads5 however our
results can be easily generalized to higher dimensions. the method we employ is to nd
out under what conditions or in which limits the localized 4d gravity decouples. we
interpret the absence of these conditions as necessary conditions for localizing gravity.
without a brane in ads5 bulk there is no gravity on the boundary as is wellknown from
the adscft duality which relates a gravitational bulk theory to a eld theory on the
boundary. this is due to the fact that there are nonnormalizable bulk gravitational modes
which cannot be excited on the boundary. localization of gravity on the brane is related
to the fact that the presence of the brane eliminates these nonnormalizable modes.

we rst consider the limit l  0. in this limit the brane approaches the boundary
and overlaps with it. from the solution in eq. (3) we see that in this limit the spacetime
goes to ads5 which has no gravity on its boundary. this means that localized 4d gravity
decouples in this limit. we also see from eq. (9) that when l  0, mp diverges. this is
another indication that 4d gravity decouples in this limit. thus, the rst condition for
localization of gravity is the presence of a brane at a nite distance from the boundary of
ads5.

we can also see this from the bound state wavefunction in the transverse z direction
given by (z)  l(z)3/2. it is easy to see that when l 6= 0, the bound state wavefunction
(z) is normalizable and gravity is localized. on the other hand, when l = 0, (z) is not
normalizable. therefore there is no bound state in the transverse direction and gravity
cannot be localized on the brane. the full geometry of the brane in ads5 is a truncated
version of ads5 which eliminates the nonnormalizable bulk graviton modes.

the second limit we consider is l nite and xed but   0, i.e. the limit in which
the tension of the brane vanishes. this is a nontrivial limit because in order for eq. (3)
to be a solution to einsteins equations we need  = 6/2
5l or using the denition of l,
 = 6/5. because of this relation we cannot take the   0 limit and keep the bulk
curved. in order to be able to take   0 and keep  xed we consider a system of two
branes at a distance with positive tensions 1 and 2[5]. the two branes can be at a nite

4

distance only if 6 > 2
1,2. note that due to the this condition the brane worldvolumes
are ads4 slices of the 5d metric with negative overall energy density. the metric which
corresponds to this case is given by[5]

52

ds2

5 = a2(w)(cid:16)dx2 + e2hx(dt2 + dy2 + dz2)(cid:17) + dw2

here h = ih where

(10)

(11)

(12)

due to the presence of the two branes at w = 0 and w = wc and the absolute value sign
in the metric the identications w  w and w  w + wc have to be made in (10). this
is precisely what would be obtained by compactifying the transverse direction on a circle
of size wc and orbifolding by z2. this metric is equivalent to the one in eq. (3) when
h = 0 with the redenition of the transverse coordinate lexp(|w|/l) = |z| + l. note that
the condition h = 0 can be written as  = 6/2
5l using the denition of l. it can be
shown that the branes are separated by a distance wc given by
56(1 + 2)
6 + 2
512

tanh(s 2

wc) =

(13)

we would like to use this conguration with two branes to reach a conguration with
only one brane which does not satisfy the relation  = 6/2
5l. in order to get rid of the
second brane we take the distance between the branes to innity. we see that wc  
requires
(14)

(6  51)(6  52) = 0

by choosing the tension of the second brane to satisfy 6 = 2
2 we send it to innity.
as a result, we are left with only one brane with positive tension 1 in ads5, but now
there is no correlation between 1 and . this is precisely the situation we wanted to
examine for the limit 1  0. in this picture, the second brane with a tension xed by 
plays a role similar to a regulator. now consider a very large but nite distance between
the two branes. then using

where a(w) is the warp factor we nd that

p =

(15)

(16)

we see that in the limit 1  0, mp diverges and 4d gravity decouples.

the third condition for localizing gravity on branes is the requirement that the brane
contribute as a -function to the stressenergy tensor which is the source of gravity as in
eq. (2). in supergravity in ads space with a domain wall this is indeed the case. consider
for example the eective lowenergy bosonic action (in d spacetime dimensions)

l = g  r

()2 + ea!

which appears in dimensionally reduced supergravity where

a2 =  +

2(d  1)
d  2

(17)

(18)

is a constant. note that this is similar to eq.(1) without the brane source term but with
a dilaton coupling. for a = 0 there is the wellknown solution which is antide sitter
space. for a 6= 0 however, the solution is a d  2 dimensional domain wall[10]

ds2 = h 4/(d2)dxdx + h 4(d1)/(d2)dy2

(19)

situated at y = 0 with h(y) = 1 + k|y|. (here h is  of the previous solution with
k = 1/l.) the curvature is smooth everywhere except at y = 0 where it has a function
singularity. this is due to the brane tension which must be included in eq.
(17) for
consistency. this -function source cuts all graviton modes on both sides of the brane, in
particular it cuts the nonnormalizable modes of the bulk graviton which allow gravity to
be localized on the brane.

finally, there can be domain wall congurations which look like eq. (3) but with a
power p of  dierent than two as in eq. (19)[11]. such congurations appear in theories
obtained by dimensional reduction of higher dimensional supergravity. then from eq. (9)

m 2

p = m 3

5 z dz3p

(20)

thus mp is nite and there is 4d gravity only if p < 1/3. the same bound also
guarantees that the bound state wavefunction in eq. (7) is normalizable.

4 conclusions and discussion

in this letter, we found the necessary conditions for localizing gravity on 3d branes (or
domain walls) in ads5. gravity is localized on the brane if 3d brane is located a nite
distance away from the boundary of ads5. the four dimensional planck scale is inversely
proportional to this distance. as a result, the smaller the distance to the boundary
the weaker is 4d gravity. when the brane is on the boundary, 4d gravity decouples as is

6

expected from the wellknown adscft duality. another condition for localizing gravity
is a nite brane tension. since for these solutions, the brane tension is proportional to
the cosmological constant this cannot be examined in a trivial manner. thus, we started
from two positive tension branes in ads5 and sent one of them to innity by xing its
tension. then we found that 4d planck scale is inversely proportional to the tension of the
remaining brane. as a result, if the tension of the brane goes to zero 4d gravity decouples.
the third condition for localization of gravity is that the contribution of the brane to the
stressenergy tensor must be a function. this is indeed the case for domain walls in
supergravity. the function cuts all momentum modes of the bulk graviton including
the ones which are nonnormalizable in full ads5 without the brane. we stress that the
geometry with the brane in the bulk of ads5 is a modied space where the part of ads5
from the brane to the boundary is deleted and the space is symmetric on both sides of
the brane. since the bulk graviton modes are now normalizable on the brane they can
be excited and this gives rise to 4d gravity. this can also be seen by inspecting the
normalizable graviton wavefunction in the fth dimension transverse to the brane.

in refs.

[2],[3], it was shown that gravity is localized on the brane by solving the
linearized einstein equations in the background of the brane in ads5. one nds that
there is a graviton zero mode in 4d which is localized around the brane. this analysis is
clearly perturbative since it considers only weak elds. it is not clear whether the same
result can be obtained for strong gravity. in particular, it is not clear how to think about
black holes either in the bulk or on the brane in this context. for example, if there is a
5d black hole inthe bulk, it is not clear how to reduce it to 4d or whether it will look
like a 4d black hole. perturbative 4d gravity looks like 5d bulk gravity compactied on
a circle of size l3/l2; however it does not seem that the same is true for 5d black holes.
similarly, it is not clear how 4d black holes which must exist look like in the bulk.

another issue is whether localization of gravity which was shown in (super)gravity can
be realized in string theory. this has been the subject of refs. [6] to some degree. in string
theory a possible setup would be iib string theory on ads5  s5 with a d3 brane in the
bulk. the part of ads5 between the brane and the boundary can be deleted by an orbifold
about the brane position. naively, the appearance of gravity on the d3 brane world
volume is very surprising since the d3 brane worldvolume theory is supersymmetric
yangmills theory at low energy. if gravity can be localized in string theory it would be
important to understand whether there is a bulk/boundary duality as in the adscft
case. in the adscft duality the dimension transverse to the boundary is holographic,
i.e. it is related to the energy scale of the boundary theory. it is not clear that this will
continue to be the case when gravity is localized on the brane.

on the more phenomenological side it is not clear how ination can be realized. pre-
voiusly considered mechanisms for ination on branes such as brane ination, asymmetric
ination and dterm ination[12] cannot be easily used in this context. this is either
due to the absence of the scalar (parametrizing the distance between branes) and radion
elds or due to the absence of an anomalous u(1) symmetry on the brane. in [5, 7] it was

7

shown that if there is an overall nonzero vacuum energy on the brane it will inate. this
requires a time dependent negative cosmological constant in the bulk, e.g. a bulk scalar
with a negative vacuum energy and a potential suitable for ination. such scalars seem to
exist in gauged supergravity and may indeed lead to ination on the brane[13]. it is im-
portant to see whether these scalars have potentials which can satisfy all the requirements
of acceptable ination.
