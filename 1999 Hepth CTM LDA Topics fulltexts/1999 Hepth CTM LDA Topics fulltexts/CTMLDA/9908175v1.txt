abstract

we determine the spectrum of graviton excitations in the background geometry of the ads
soliton in p+2 dimensions. via the ads/cft correspondence, this corresponds to determining
the spectrum of spin-two excitations in the dual eective p-dimensional eld theories. for the
cases of d3- and m5-branes, these are the spin-two glueballs of qcd3 and qcd4, respectively.
for all values of p, we nd an exact degeneracy of the spectra of these tensor states and certain
scalar excitations. our results also extend the perturbative proof of a positive energy conjecture
for asymptotically locally ads spacetimes (originally proposed for p=3) to an arbitrary number
of dimensions.

1 introduction

the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3]  for a comprehensive review, see ref. [4]  has
provided new perspectives on the holographic principle [5], which asserts that a consistent
theory of quantum gravity in d dimensions must have an alternate formulation in terms of a
nongravitational theory in d 1 dimensions. this equivalence is implemented in the ads/cft
correspondence with a duality between a gravitational theory in d-dimensional anti-de sitter
space and a conformal eld theory on a (d  1)-dimensional boundary space. using this
correspondence, one can gain new insights into both of the theories on either side of the duality.
on the one hand, quantum gravity is reformulated as an ordinary quantum eld theory and so
one has a new framework with which to study the perplexing puzzles surrounding black holes
and hawking evaporation. on the other hand, the duality has become a useful tool with which
to study a wide class of strongly coupled eld theories in a non-perturbative framework.

in the latter context, the ads/cft correspondence has been extensively used to study
qcd-like eld theories by considering a variety of solutions to ads supergravity  see, for
example, refs. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. the original proposal by witten[6] was made in the setting
of string theory, where the conformal eld theory is a supersymmetric gauge theory. one can
describe ordinary (i.e., nonsupersymmetric) yang-mills theory by compactifying one of the
spatial directions on a small circle and imposing antiperiodic boundary conditions on the
fermions around this direction. in this case, the additional fermions and scalars appearing in
the supersymmetric eld theory would acquire large masses of the order of the compactication
scale, leaving the gauge elds as the only low energy degrees of freedom. on the supergravity
side, this proposal corresponds to considering spacetimes which are asymptotically ads locally,
but not globally. the relevant supergravity solution was found[6] to be the ads soliton 
following the nomenclature of ref. [13]  that is the double analytic continuation of a planar
ads black hole.
in this geometry, the circle direction smoothly contracts to a point in the
interior and as a result of this nontrivial topology, the supergravity fermions (and their dual
gauge theory counterparts) are antiperiodic on the asymptotic circle.

in the special case of supergravity on ads5, which arises in the throat geometry of d3-
branes, the dual eld theory is four-dimensional n = 4 su(n) super-yang-mills theory and so
upon compactication, the above construction produces an eective model of three-dimensional
ordinary yang-mills theory, i.e., qcd3 [6]. similarly beginning with ads7, which arises from
m5-branes, and compactifying two directions, one produces a model of qcd4 [6]. this idea
has been exploited[3, 7] to make predictions about the large-n behavior of these qcd theories
at strong coupling. specically, it was shown[6] that these theories generically produce an
area law for spatial wilson loops and possess a mass gap, both of which are evidence for
connement. the spectrum of scalar glueballs for qcd3,4 was been calculated[7], and found
to be remarkably similar to that calculated by lattice techniques[14, 15, 16]. a similar scalar
spectrum was calculated for arbitrary dp-branes in ref. [10].

in this paper we will extend the work of refs. [7, 10] by calculating the complete spectrum
of spin-two excitations of the eectively p-dimensional eld theories which are dual to the
ads soliton in p + 2 dimensions. in the cases, for which p = 3 or p = 5, this amounts to a
determination of the spin-two glueball spectra in qcd3 and qcd4. for all values of p, we nd
a surprising degeneracy between the spin-two states and scalar excitations associated with a
minimally coupled massless scalar eld propagating on the ads soliton background.

1

another interesting development motivated by the ads/cft correspondence was the pro-
posal of a new positive energy conjecture for asymptotically locally ads spaces [13]. this
investigation was originally motivated by the observation that in asymptotically at space-
times geometries in which an asymptotic circle is contractible are unstable because the energy
can be arbitrarily negative[17]. for gravity with a negative cosmological constant, one does nd
that the ads soliton has a nite negative energy. however, in ref. [13] for ve dimensions, it
was shown that this solution is perturbatively stable and that the negative energy is naturally
identied with the casimir energy of the dual eld theory  see also ref. [18]. hence motivated
by the ads/cft correspondence, it was proposed that the ads soliton is in fact the minimum
energy solution with the given asymptotic structure. our present calculation extend the results
of ref. [13] by providing a perturbative proof of the stability of the ads soliton which holds in
all dimensions d  4. hence we are lead to extend the positive energy conjecture of ref. [13]
beyond ve dimensions, which was the focus of their discussion.

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we review the standard approach to calcu-
lating glueball spectra using ads/cft correspondence. in section 3, we calculate the spectrum
of spin-two excitations in the eld theory dual to the ads soliton in arbitrary dimensions. in
section 4, we consider our results as a perturbative proof of the positive energy conjecture of
ref. [13] extended to arbitrary dimensions. section 5 contains a further discussion of our results.

2 review of scalar spectra

in the framework of string theory where the ads/cft duality is best understood, simple
backgrounds are both supersymmetric and conformally invariant. both of these symmetries
must be eliminated to construct models of real world qcd. wittens suggestion[6] described
above breaks supersymmetry with the antiperiodic fermion boundary conditions, and breaks
the conformal invariance by introducing a scale, namely the size of the circle. the appropriate
supergravity background satisfying the desired boundary conditions is the ads soliton. for
this solution, witten argued that the supergravity elds must have a discrete spectrum, and
hence a mass gap would exist in the dual eld theory[6]. the ads/cft correspondence gives
the interpretation that the the supergravity modes represent excitations of particular gauge
theory operators, which then possess a discrete mass spectrum. these results were veried in
detail in refs. [7, 8].

generalizing to p + 2 dimensions, the ads soliton metric may be written as

ds2 =

r2

l2 (cid:16)f (r)d 2 + dxdx(cid:17) +
with f (r) =  1 

rp+1 !

rp+1

l2
r2 f 1(r)dr2

(1)

where dxdx is the p-dimensional minkowski metric. this geometry can be constructed by
a double analytic continuation of a planar ads black hole in horospheric coordinates  see, for
example, the discussion in ref. [13]. the geometry is only locally asymptotically ads because
implicitly the  coordinate is chosen to be periodic in order to avoid a conical singularity at

2

r = r. choosing the period to be

 =

4l2

(p + 1)r

(2)

the circle parametrized by  smoothly shrinks to a point at r = r. as a result, in the context
of supergravity, the fermionic elds and their dual gauge theory counterparts are antiperiodic
around the  circle.

this geometry was considered for the special cases p = 3 and 5 in ref. [7, 8] where the mass
spectra for 0++ glueballs in qcd3 and qcd4 were calculated.1 ref. [7] also presents the mass
spectra for 0 and 0+ glueballs by considering the appropriate supergravity elds. scalar
glueball spectra have also been analyzed in detail in refs. [20].

one proceeds by solving the linearized wave equation for a minimally coupled massless

scalar eld propagating in the above background (1). specically one considers the equation

2 =

1

g

(cid:16)gg (cid:17) = 0 .

(3)

in the case of p = 3, i.e., d3-branes, this scalar corresponds to the dilaton which is dual
to the gauge theory operator which is the supersymmetric extension of trf 2 [21, 2, 7]. one
introduces the ansatz  = b(r)eikx, where b(r) is the radial prole to be determined and the
momentum k is a p-vector with only components in the minkowski space directions spanned
by the coordinates x. one then has k2 = m 2 giving the invariant mass-squared of the dual
scalar operator in the eective p-dimensional eld theory. substituting this ansatz into eq. (3)
one obtains an ordinary dierential equation for the radial prole b(r),

r (rp+1  rp+1)

b(r)

r (rp+1  rp+1)

b(r) = 0

(4)

to facilitate our analysis, this equation can be put into a schrodinger-like form [10, 20] by
redening the wave function b(r) as b(r) = (r)(r) where,

(r) = s

r  r

r(rp+1  rp+1)

.

(5)

and then performing a change of variables according to r = r(1 + ey). eq. (4) now takes the
form:

where the eective potential is given by

 (y) + v (y) (y) = 0

v (y) =

(7)

this complicated analytic form for the potential belies a relatively simple shape, as shown in
gure 1. now one must tune the potential by adjusting the parameter m 2 so that eq. (6)

between type iia superstrings in ten dimensions and m-theory in eleven dimensions [19].

yields a normalizable bound state at zero energy. one thing that is easily veried is that
the scalar eld uctuations produce no instabilities for this supergravity background. that is
there are no tachyonic solutions since when m 2 is negative (or even positive but small  see
below) the potential well in gure 1 disappears and v (y) is everywhere positive. the equation

2note that the calculation described here for the ads soliton in p+2 dimensions is not the same as that in
ref. [10]. there minahan considers the propagation of the dilaton for a generalized dp-brane background. thus
the results only agree with the present analysis for the special case p = 3.

exist even without making the wkb approximation. in terms of the original r coordinate in

3 the graviton spectrum

the purpose of the present paper is to repeat these calculations for gravitons propagating in
the adsp+2 soliton, and hence to calculate the spectrum of spin-two excitations for the eective
p-dimensional eld theories. the latter excitations are those associated with the stress-energy
tensor t of the conformal eld theory as this is the operator coupling to the ads metric
perturbations, i.e., the gravitons, according to the ads/cft correspondence [22, 23]  see
discussion in ref. [18]. to determine the spectrum, we must solve the equations of motion for
the gravitons on the background (1). specically we write the perturbed metric as

gab = gab + hab

(15)

where gab denotes the background metric (1) which is a solution of einsteins equations in p + 2
dimensions with a negative cosmological constant:

3in comparing with the results of ref. [10], note that m 2(here) = 2m 2(there).

rab +

p + 1
l2 gab = 0 .

(16)

linearizing the latter equations of motion, the metric perturbation hab must satisfy [24]:

1
2ab hc

c +

1
22hab  c(ahb)c 

p + 1
l2 hab = 0

(17)

where the background metric gab is used to raise and lower indices as well as to dene the
covariant derivatives in this equation. now in analogy to the scalar eld calculations, we make
the ansatz that the graviton is given by hab = hab(r)eikx where hab(r) is the radial prole tensor
and k is a p-dimensional momentum vector with k2 = m 2. to determine the spectrum, we
must solve eq. (17) with this ansatz as an eigenvalue problem for the mass m.

a feature here is the fact that hab(r) is a tensor and there are thus a variety of polariza-
tions, or graviton modes, that need to be considered. further there are the ambiguities in the
metric perturbations arising from dieomorphism invariance, which we handle by imposing a
transverse gauge: hak = 0. for massive excitations we may always, via the appropriate
lorentz boost, choose to work in the rest frame4 so that the momentum can be written as
k =  

t . in this case, the transversality condition becomes,

hak = 0  hat = 0 a

(18)

our implicit notation for the p-dimensional minkowski space coordinates is x = (t, xi) with
i = 1, . . . , p  1.

3.1 simple transverse traceless polarizations

in presenting the solutions of eq. (17), we begin with the gravitons polarized in the directions
parallel to the hypersurface spanned by the coordinates x, i.e., we give the solutions with

h a = hra = 0 = hak

 a ,

(19)

where we have included the gauge condition (18) in this list of restrictions. from the point of
view of the dual eld theory, these excitations correspond to spin-two states. other polarizations
would be interpreted as scalar or vector states in the p-dimensional eld theory  see below.

a consistent solution is provided by the following ansatz

hab = ab

r2
l2 h(r)

(20)

where the constant polarization tensor ab satises the restrictions given in eq. (19). solving
the equations of motion (17) imposes one further restriction on the polarization, namely, it
must be traceless

 = 0 .

(21)
thus eq. (20) describes (p + 1)(p  2)/2 independent modes, which can be described as (p 
1)(p  2)/2 o-diagonal polarizations, e.g.,
12 = 21 = 1 ,

otherwise ab = 0

(22)

4our analysis was done for the completely general case, however, here we anticipate a spectrum with positive

denite mass squared.

6

and (p  2) traceless diagonal polarizations, e.g.,

11 = 22 = 1 ,

otherwise ab = 0 .

(23)

we also observe that (p + 1)(p  2)/2 corresponds to precisely the number of polarizations of
a massive spin-two particle in p dimensions.

for all of these independent polarizations, the radial prole h(r) satises the same dier-

ential equation. substituting the above ansatz (20) into eq. (17) yields

2h(r)
r2 +

(p + 2)rp+1  rp+1
r(rp+1  rp+1)

h(r)

r

+

m 2l4rp3
(rp+1  rp+1)

h(r) = 0

(24)

as for the case of the scalar equation (4), we put this equation into a schrodinger-like form by
setting h(r) = (r)(r) with

and by again changing variables according to r = r(1 + ey). eq. (24) now takes the form,

(r) = s

r  r

r(rp+1  rp+1)

,

where the eective potential is given by,

 (y) + v (y)(y) = 0

v (y) =

(25)

(26)

(27)

now let us compare this eective potential (27) with eq. (7) for the minimally coupled
massless scalar eld considered in the previous section. one sees immediately that the eective
potentials (7) and (27) are identical! in fact, the equations of motion (4) and (24) are also
identical.
in other words, the scalar and the transverse traceless gravitons considered here
have exactly the same equations of motion and hence they have identical mass spectra, for all
values of p. via the ads/cft correspondence, this implies the degeneracy of tensor and scalar
excitations in the corresponding dual eld theories, i.e.,

m2++
m0++

= 1 .

(28)

in the case of qcd3, the prediction is that the glueball spectra of the operators t rf 2 and t
are degenerate. we will comment more on this degeneracy in the discussion section.

within the wkb approximation, we may read o the spectrum of the transverse traceless
gravitons from the results of the scalar eld analysis in eqs. (13) and (14). note, however, that
the scalar-tensor degeneracy is an exact statement, which holds outside of any approximation
scheme used to compute the masses.

3.2 exotic polarizations

the remaining linearized graviton solutions come in two categories. the rst would appear as
vectors in the dual eld theory, and they may be given with the same ansatz as in eq. (20)

hab = ab

r2
l2 h(r)

(29)

however, in this case the nonvanishing components of the polarization tensor take the form

  =  = v ,

with k  v = 0 and v  v = 1 .

(30)

thus this vector solution contains (p  1) independent modes. substituting into the equations
of motion (17) now yields the radial equation

h(r) = 0 .

(31)

using the eld redenition h(r) = (r)(r) where now (r) = q rr

rp+2 and again changing
variables to the y coordinate as before, we nd a schrodinger-like equation where the potential
is given by:

v (y) =

(32)

(34)

note in this case that the inner turning point, r (given in terms of the original r coordinate),
is situated away from the surface r = r. given these results, the wkb mass spectrum is:

(35)

note that this wkb result is very similar to that for the scalars (and transverse traceless
gravitons) given in eq. (13), with the only dierence being in the coecient of the o(n) term.
for the cases of interest for qcd3,4, this expression yields

r2 = 50. there are

and so these vector excitations are slightly heavier than the tensors or scalars. the latter
applies generally for p < 7, while in fact the vectors become lighter for p > 7. at p = 7, one
nds that the vector spectrum here is degenerate with that for the scalars, however, this is a
degeneracy which only holds within the approximations of our wkb calculation. since the
eective potentials (7) and (32) remain dierent for p = 7, this degeneracy should be lifted by
higher order corrections, but we can not say which set of states will give the heavier spectrum.

the last polarization is diagonal and would appear as a scalar excitation in the p-dimensional
eld theory. to construct this nal solution of the linearized equations of motion (17), we begin
with the following ansatz:

r2
h  (r) = 
l2 f (r)h(r)
r2
l2  a(r) +
h(r) =
l2
r2 f 1(r)c(r)

hrr(r) =

hr(r) = ik d(r)

kk

m 2 (b(r) + a(r))!

(37)

where f (r) is as dened in eq. (1) and all other components of hab vanish. note that we have
not imposed the transverse gauge condition (18) in the ansatz above. substituting this ansatz

9

into eq. (17), consistency of the equations requires

a(r) =

c(r) =

h(r)

1
p  1
2prp+1  (p  1)rp+1 h(r)

(p + 1)rp+1

while the function d(r) is determined by b(r) and h(r) through the relation

(38)

d(r) =

p(p + 1)2rp+2rp+1h(r)

r

+

(2prp+1  (p  1)rp+1)2 l2m 2

.

(39)

hence one has the freedom to choose d(r) by making the appropriate choice for the functional
form of b(r). for the present calculations, a convenient choice is to eliminate the derivative
terms appearing in eq. (39), which allows one to express the polarization tensor explicitly in
terms of h(r). this gauge choice is accomplished by choosing

which yields

b(r) = 

(p + 1)rp+1

2prp+1  (p  1)rp+1 h(r)

d(r) =

2p(p + 1)2rp+2rp+1h(r)

m 2l2 (2prp+1  (p  1)rp+1)2 .

(40)

(41)

an alternative choice is to set b(r) = a(r), for which the diagonal components of the
polarization along the x directions have the form   . thus this choice makes manifest
the lorentz invariance of this polarization in the p dimensions of the eld theory  otherwise
it would only be lorentz invariant up to a gauge transformation  and so it is obvious that
these modes are actually dual to scalar excitations in the eld theory.5

using the results in eq. (38), the coupled set of equations (17) reduce to a single second
order linear ode for the function h(r) which upon redening h(r) by h(r) = (r)(r) where

(r) = s

and changing to the y coordinate of the previous sections takes the standard schrodinger form

the potential is written here in a way so that it only diers from the scalar potential (7) by
the addition of the last term.

5note that with b = a in eq. (37), there are still the o-diagonal components hr  k, but they do not
constitute an independent vector. further one could remove these components with an innitesimal dieomor-
phism with va = d(r) exp(ik  x) r
a, but then the ansatz for the diagonal components becomes even more
complicated.

4 positive energy conjecture

in this section, we consider the implications of the above results for the positive energy con-
jecture put forth in ref. [13]. while the conjecture there was formulated for ve dimensions,
here we wish to consider the generalization to an arbitrary number of dimensions (greater than
three). hence consider solutions of einsteins equations in p + 2 dimensions with a negative cos-
mological constant, which asymptotically approach the ads soliton metric gab given in eq. (1)
with

where the perturbation hab has the following asymptotic behavior

gab = gab + hab

hab = o(rp+1), har = o(rp1), hrr = o(rp3)

with a, b 6= r .

(46)

(47)

then e(gab)  e(gab) with equality obtained if and only if gab = gab. in ref. [13], it was veried
that, for the case of p = 3, the ads soliton is perturbatively stable to all linearized deformations
of the metric. in the following, we apply directly the results obtained in section 3 to give a
proof of perturbative stability of this solution in arbitrary numbers of dimensions.

the essential point is that in the spectra calculated in the previous section, we found that
m 2 > 0 in all cases. hence through the ads/cft correspondence, these metric uctuations

will be dual to positive energy excitations of the eld theory, with e = p ni i where ni is

the number of quanta excited in a particular mode with frequency  = kt. from this point
of view, negative energies or instabilities would be signaled by the appearance of tachyonic
excitations with m 2 < 0. for a complete discussion of perturbative stability of the ads soliton,
one should also consider all linearized solutions including those with momenta in the compact
 direction. naively, one expects that adding such internal momenta will only increase the
masses. in fact, this intuition is correct, and we leave the detailed analysis of these modes to
appendix a. hence m 2 > 0 for all graviton modes, and so this indicates that the ads soliton
is stable against all linearized metric uctuations in any number of dimensions.

given that we wish to determine whether a particular solution of einsteins equations is
perturbatively stable against metric deformations, we should be able to address this question in
a purely gravitational framework, without reference to the ads/cft correspondence. we do
so now by considering the construction for gravitational energy by abbot and deser[25]. one
begins by dividing the metric as in eq. (46), but now the metric deformation hab is considered
to be dened globally. given this decomposition and the fact that the background metric gab
satises einsteins equations with a negative cosmological constant,

rab

the equations determining the deformation hab may be written as[25]:

(49)

here the superscript l denotes that these curvature terms have been linearized in hab, while
the stress-energy tensor on the right-hand side is dened to include all terms second order

12

and higher in hab. because the left-hand side of eq. (49) obeys the background bianchi identity,

a(cid:16)rl

ab  1/2gabrl + p(p + 1)/(2l2)hab(cid:17) = 0, the einstein equations (49) dictate that

(50)
as an exact result, where a denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the background
metric gab. further, it is understood that all indices are raised and lowered here using the
background metric. now, given a killing vector a of the background metric, one has

atab = 0

a(cid:16)tabb(cid:17) = 0

z  (t  )

(51)

(54)

as a result of the killing vector identity, ab + ba = 0, and the symmetry of tab. denoting
the one-form
(52)

(t  ) = dxa tabb ,

then the dual (p + 1)-form is closed, i.e.,

d  (t  ) = 0 ,

(53)

given the vanishing divergence in eq. (51). thus integrating this form over a p + 1 dimensional
surface with a time-like normal

yields a conserved charge.6 now focusing our attention on the time-like killing vector aa = t
of the ads soliton background, the killing energy is dened as the conserved charge

e =

1

8g z  (t  )

(55)

where the normalization is chosen here to match that of alternate denitions for asymptotically
ads spacetimes, such as in refs. [18, 26, 27, 28].

the preceding discussion refers to an exact solution of einsteins equations, i.e., given the
metric decomposition (46) with the background satisfying eq. (48), eq. (49) is satised to all
orders in hab. in the analysis of the previous section, we have only been considering metric
deformations which satisfy the linearized einstein equations (17), i.e., all of the higher order
terms implicit in tab in eq. (49) have been dropped. consistent with this linearized analysis,
our strategy will be to identify the stress-energy density of our perturbed spacetimes to be the
contributions quadratic in hab in eq. (55). this approach will be sucient to identify whether
or not the background metric is perturbatively stable.

it is simplest to apply this analysis to the transverse traceless modes of section 3.1. we

write the metric perturbation as

hab = ab

r2
l2 h(r, , x)

(56)

where the constant polarization tensor satises the constraints ra =  a = 0 = ah, as
well as  = 0. also the polarization will be normalized such that abab = 2, as in the

where  = kt. clearly now, this expression is manifestly positive denite, and so the ads
soliton is perturbatively stable to deformations by these modes. note that this classical result
is consistent with that stated above from the ads/cft correspondence.
in particular, the
lorentz-invariant measure for momentum modes is dp1k/(~k) which is why the eld theory
energy is proportional to  while the classical result (58) has a factor of 2. further the
quantum number operator in the eld theory will be proportional to the eld squared as in
eq. (58), and the factor of g1 would be absorbed using the canonical normalization for the
quantum graviton eld  see, e.g., ref. [30]. note that here we assume a simple local mapping
between the perturbative quantum eld in the supergravity theory, i.e., the gravitons, and the
dual quantum eld in the conformal eld theory, as in the discussions of ref. [31]  see below,
however. performing the same analysis for the exotic polarizations of section 3.2 and appendix
a is more complicated. the results are simple, however, if we consider only the modes which
are independent of the compact coordinate  . for example, consider our ansatz for the vector
modes

(59)
where the nonvanishing components of the polarization tensor are   =  = v with k  v = 0
and v  v = 1. note that in order to produce a sensible energy, we have again taken the real
part of the ansatz used in section 3. such a metric perturbation then yields

ansatz presented in eq. (82) for the scalar modes, we nd a relatively simple expression for the
quadratic killing energy

e =

both of these expressions are manifestly positive denite, and so obviously the ads soliton is
perturbatively stable to deformations by these modes.

the gravitational calculation of the energy of the vector and scalar modes becomes far more
complicated. for example, for the vector modes with  -dependence, one works with the real
part of the ansatz described in eq. (77) of the appendix. inserting this into the above formulae
(55) yields an extremely long expression for the energy density. one can arrange this expression
in powers of the ads radius l giving,

where the remaining implicit terms at o(q2/l4) and o(q4/l8) ll another page and a half,
and are not particularly illuminating. in particular, while one can see immediately that the
rst term above is positive denite, the sign of the remaining higher order contributions is not
obvious. therefore establishing that the energy in eq. (62) is positive denite requires a more
extended analysis. we will not present such an analysis here, but one can be condent in the
result since there is also the much simpler proof relying on the ads/cft duality described
above. one also runs into similar complications in calculating the gravitational energy for the
scalar modes with nontrivial  -dependence.

as a nal point on the discussion of the gravitational energy, it may be disconcerting that
the expressions for the vector and scalar modes with nontrivial  -dependence, e.g., eq. (62), are
so complicated. these expressions suggest that there is a complicated nonlocal relationship be-
tween the quantum operators producing the graviton excitations in the ads soliton background
and the dual operators in the eld theory. this result may be surprising given that in ref. [31],
a simple identity was established between the ads and cft quantum modes for all excitations.
however, that analysis applied for a (super)gravity background which was purely anti-de sitter
space, and the identication relied on the large symmetry group of this background. only a
small part of this symmetry group survives for the ads soliton background, and so perhaps
it not so surprising that the relationships can become more complicated. these complications
are probably also related to the nonlocal expressions that arise for various metric components
in the relevant graviton modes, e.g., see eq. (78).

5 discussion

in this paper we have calculated the complete spectrum of metric uctuations of the (p + 2)-
dimensional ads soliton given in eq. (1). the dual conformal eld theory will be formulated
on a (p + 1)-dimensional background geometry m p  s1 with metric

ds2 = dxdx + d 2

(63)

where  inherits the same period  as in eq. (2).
in the limit, that this circle direction is
small, the eld theory should become eectively p-dimensional. from string theory, it is in
this situation that the ads soliton has been suggested to give a dual description of ordinary
yang-mills theory in three or four dimensions. for the polarizations which are conned to the
x directions then, our results correspond to the mass spectrum of the spin-two excitations of
the eective p-dimensional eld theory. a second interesting implication of our analysis is that
since we have found that m 2 > 0 for all of the modes, our results conrm the perturbative
stability of the (p+2)-dimensional ads soliton, and thus provide evidence the positive energy
conjecture of ref. [13] can be extended to arbitrary numbers of dimensions.

2p(p + 1)  1 physical degrees of freedom.

being a massless spin-two eld, the graviton propagating in any (p+2)-dimensional space-
time has 1
in the present case, these degrees of
freedom are organized as representations of the p-dimensional lorentz symmetry of the ads
soliton background. these are: (p + 1)(p  2)/2 modes in massive spin-two representations,
p 1 polarizations in massive vector representations, and 1 set of massive scalar states. each of
these sets of states is further labeled by the integer n giving the momentum in the  -direction,
i.e., q = 2n/. these graviton modes are dual to operators in the corresponding conformal

15

eld theory with the same quantum numbers. in fact, one knows that the relevant operator is
the stress-energy tensor tab of the (p+1)-dimensional eld theory as this is the operator cou-
pling to the ads metric perturbations according to the ads/cft correspondence [22, 23]. of
course, the various components of tab are decomposed according to the so(1, p 1) symmetry
of the boundary manifold (63) matching the decomposition of the metric uctuations described
above.

thus when the various graviton modes are excited in the ads soliton background, there
should be a corresponding excitation in the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor in the
dual eld theory description. one can verify that the metric uctuations fall o with precisely
the appropriate rate to yield a nonvanishing htabi, i.e., hab = o(rp+1) in p+2 dimensions [18].
examining the asymptotic behavior of the eective potential for any of the modes, one nds

v (y >> 0) 

(p + 1)2

(64)

thus to leading order in this regime, the normalizable solution of the schrodinger equation
behaves as

(y >> 0)  e

p+1

2 y  (cid:18) r
r (cid:19)

p+1

.

(65)

now while the details of the eld redenition factor varies from mode to mode, one nds that
they all have the same asymptotic behavior at large r, namely (r >> 0)  (r/r)
2 , and
hence to leading order, the radial prole becomes

p+1

h(r) = (r)(r)  (cid:18)r

r (cid:19)p+1

.

(66)

finally various components of the metric uctuations contain r2h(r) = o(rp+1), giving pre-
cisely the desired fall o.

so for example, the transverse traceless gravitons correspond to inducing an excitation of

the stress-energy in the eld theory with

hti   cos(k  x + q )

(67)

where  is the polarization tensor appearing in the metric uctuation which satises k =
0 = . similarly for the vector modes, one nds from eq. (77) that the nonvanishing
stress-energy components are

ht i  v cos(k  x + q )

and hti 

q
m 2 (kv + vk) cos(k  x + q )

(68)

where k  v = 0 and v  v = 1. here, although there are nontrivial metric components hr,
asymptotically they fall o too rapidly to contribute in the calculation of htabi [18]. finally for
the scalar mode (37) with q = 0, one nds

ht i  (p  1) cos(k  x)

and hti    +

kk

m 2 ! cos(k  x)

(69)

note that all of these stresses are traceless and transverse in the p+1 dimensional background
ai = 0 = htabikb where ka = (k, q). note that the three
(63) of the eld theory, i.e., ht a

16

expressions above correspond to the additional stress-energy associated with the graviton. the
ads soliton itself also induces an nontrivial casimir stress-energy [18].

note that with a single mode excited in its rest frame, i.e., with ka = (m, 0, . . . , 0, q), no
energy density is induced. there are only stresses in the spatial directions for all such modes.
however, in general there is a nontrivial expectation httti, and in fact there are regions of
negative as well as positive energy density because of the cosine factors. note however that the
negative and positive contributions precisely cancel out to yield zero total energy at this order.
for example, in the cases where q 6= 0, integrating over the compact  -direction is enough to
produce a vanishing result. this is the expected result since the induced energy densities here
are linear in the amplitude of the metric uctuations, and we found in section 4 that the total
energy was in fact quadratic in this amplitude. similar observations were made in ref. [32] where
the scattering of gravitons in ads space was considered. the vanishing total energy emerging
from these calculations is a result of the fact that we have only considered the linearized einstein
equations in discussing the present graviton modes. if one were to completely solve the full
einstein equations or at least solve them to next order in the amplitude of the waves, one
would nd that the long-range metric perturbations would receive second-order contributions

yielding e = r d dp1xi httti > 0. the integrand of the energy expressions in section 4 would

be closely related to the source terms for the second order contribution in the metric uctuation
htt. these second order contributions would ensure that while there are locally regions with
negative energy density, they are always accompanied by regions with a larger net positive
energy density, in keeping with the quantum interest conjecture[33].

since the vector modes couple to  -components of the stress-energy tensor (even with q = 0)
in the eld theory, as shown in eq. (68), and the background metric (63) is diagonal, one would
require that these modes should decouple if the ads soliton is to provide a good description of an
eective p-dimensional eld theory.7 in fact, however, there is no evidence of such decoupling8
as the masses of all states are roughly of the order  1. in fact, as noted before, the vector
modes are lighter than the spin-two modes for p > 7. this is similar to the non-decoupling of
excitations on the internal s5 found in considering the case of p = 3 [29]. in this string theory
context, one might consider the eect of -corrections to the string theory action [34]. such
higher derivative terms would modify both the ads soliton background [35] and the equations of
motion. however, we did not pursue these lengthy calculations. in the context of the higher s5
harmonics, it was found that the leading -corrections did not produce the desired decoupling,
and it was conjectured that decoupling may only result through nonperturbative eects [29].

a surprising result that we have found is that for all values of p the spectrum of the spin-
two modes is exactly degenerate with that of a minimally coupled massless scalar eld. in the
dual eld theory, there will be an exact degeneracy of the corresponding spin-two and spin-zero
excitations. in particular then, in the case of p = 3 where the eective eld theory is ordinary
(i.e., nonsupersymmetric) yang-mills theory in three dimensions[6], there will be a degeneracy
of the spin-two glueballs associated with the stress tensor t, and the spin-zero glueballs
associated with the operator trf 2. we emphasize that the degeneracy of these spectra is a
consequence of the fact that the dilaton and the gravitons satisfy precisely the same equation
7the same should be true for the scalar modes. however, with q = 0 only ht i 6= 0 in eq. (69), and this

of motion, and is not an artifact of the wkb calculations presented in section 3. there is
a similar degeneracy for spin-two and scalar glueballs in qcd4, which is associated with the
ads7 soliton with p = 5 [6]  see below. this is a surprising prediction of the ads/cft
correspondence as current lattice simulations[14, 15, 16] certainly do not provide any evidence
of such a remarkable degeneracy. rather the lattice calculations suggest that the spin-two
excitations should be more massive than the scalar glueballs. for the lowest lying glueballs,
simulations for qcd3 [14] estimate m2++/m0++  1.65  0.04 for the large n limit. similarly,
for qcd4 [15], lattice calculations suggest m2++/m0++  1.39  0.13 in the large n limit.
(the errors quoted are the statistical errors arising in extrapolating to the continuum from
the lattice.) of course, this discrepancy between the lattice calculations and the ads/cft
correspondence is not a direct contradiction. the gravity calculations performed here would be
valid for su(n) gauge theory in the large n limit in of (very) large t hooft coupling g2n. in
contrast the lattice results would hold for weak t hooft coupling. hence it might be that this
degeneracy is a result of the strong coupling limit relevant for the supergravity calculations.
again, it would be interesting to see to what extent the degeneracy is lifted by -corrections
to the low energy action.
it would also be interesting to see if this degeneracy survives in
other supergravity models exhibiting qcd-like behavior[11, 12] (such as running couplings and
asymptotic freedom).

we have no insight as to why the spectrum of the spin-two graviton modes should be
degenerate with that of a scalar eld in general. however, for p = 3, it can be related to
previous observations about d3-branes.
in ref. [22], it was found that in the background
geometry of a d3-brane, the gravitons polarized along the world-volume had an action of the
form,

(70)

i = 

1

64g10 z d10xghabhab

and thus, from the point of view of the transverse space and time, they behave as minimally
coupled massless scalars. as a result, it was shown that the classical absorption cross-sections
were identical for these gravitons and the dilaton. now it is easy to verify that the same
observations still hold true in the geometry of an analytically continued near-extremal d3-
brane, as long as the graviton polarizations have no  -components. the throat geometry of
such a d3-brane would be the direct product of the ads5 soliton with a ve-sphere. the ads5
soliton geometry is comprised of the world-volume directions and the radial direction in the
transverse space.
in the spectrum calculations on the ads soliton background, one focuses
essentially on the time and radius part of the wave equation, which would be identical to that
arising in the propagation of an s-wave in the throat geometry. thus one can interpret the
result, that the eld equations governing the spin-two modes are the same as for a scalar eld,
as a reection of the above observation that these spin-two modes behave as scalar elds in the
transverse space.

in ref. [10], minahan calculated the spectrum of the dilaton (a minimally coupled massless
scalar) propagating in the throat geometry of an analytically continued near-extremal dp-brane
for general p. these throat geometries are not precisely the same as the adsp soliton as these
backgrounds also contain a nontrivial dilaton eld, except for p = 3. one may note, however,
that there is a matching of his dilaton spectrum for the d1,3,4-branes with that of a scalar
in the ads soliton with p = 2, 3, 5, respectively. of course, this is not a surprise for the d3-
brane where the throat geometry is just the ads soliton with p = 3. for the d4-brane, the
matching arises because this brane in the type iia string theory can be lifted to an m5-brane

18

in d=11 supergravity [36], where the throat geometry contains an ads7 soliton factor with
p = 5. similarly through a chain of dualities, the d1-brane of the type iib string theory can
be related to the m2-brane, where the ads2 soliton with p = 2 appears in the throat geometry.
however, note that there are no scalar elds in d=11 supergravity. the string theory dilaton
arises as part of the eleven-dimensional metric. hence the matching of the spectra that we
noted above only occurs because of the degeneracy of spin-two graviton modes and scalar eld
excitations in the ads soliton background, since minahan [10] actually calculated the spectrum
of a particular mode of the graviton in a dual description. in fact, in the case of the m2-brane
for which there are no spin-two excitations, the degeneracy arises as an artifact of the wkb
approximation for which the spin-zero graviton spectrum (45) matched that of the scalar eld
(13).

the case of the m5-brane is of particular interest as it may give a dual description of qcd4
[6]. one can regard the eld theory as being obtained from the compactication of the six-
dimensional (0, 2) conformal eld theory on s1  s1 where the rst circle is much smaller than
the second circle, on which one also imposes supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions [6].
in terms of the ads/cft correspondence, this is equivalent to m-theory on an ads soliton
with p = 5 in a direct product with a four-sphere. the ads soliton geometry is

ds2 =

r2

l2 (cid:16)f (r)d 2 + dz2 + dxdx(cid:17) +
with f (r) = 1 

r6

l2
r2 f 1(r)dr2

(71)

where z and  are the coordinates parameterizing the rst and second circles above, respectively.
as described above, dimensionally reducing on z yields type iia string theory on the throat
geometry of a(n appropriate) d4-brane. now with respect to the x-directions, there are two
spin-zero modes in the metric uctuations. the rst would be the polarization identied as
the scalar mode given in eq. (37) with p = 5. the second would be a mode identied as a
transverse traceless mode in section 3.1 with a polarization tensor of the form

zz = 4

and  =  +

kk
m 2

.

(72)

as both of these modes would contain hzz uctuations, they would both seem to mix with
the ten-dimensional string theory dilaton [37]. we are not sure how these two modes are dis-
tinguished, but presumably one should decouple while the other is dual to spin-zero glueballs
associated with the operator trf 2 in qcd4. in any event, at least with in the wkb approxi-
mation, the spectra of both modes are degenerate, and so our calculations suggest a degeneracy
of the spin-two and spin-zero glueballs at least in the large n limit of qcd4.

a appendix

in this appendix, we provide some of the details for the analysis of the metric uctuations
with nontrivial  -dependence. in this case the ansatz made in section 3 is extended to hab =
hab(r)ei(kx+q ) where q is the momentum in the compact direction given by q = 2n/ for any
integer n and the period  is given in eq. (2). for the purposes of gauge xing, it is natural
to include q as the last component of a (p + 1)-dimensional momentum vector, ka = (k, q).
for the sake of simplicity, we will choose to work in the p-dimensional rest frame of these
excitations, i.e., with an appropriate lorentz boost, we set ka = (m, 0, . . . , 0, q). now the
natural transversality condition to impose on the metric perturbations becomes

where  a = ra = ta = 0. substituting the extended ansatz into eq. (17), one nds that
the only eect of adding the compact momenta is to shift the mass term in eq. (24) by m 2 
m 2q2/f (r) where f (r) is the function appearing in the metric in eq. (1). after performing the
same wavefunction redenition and change of variables as described in section 3.1, the equation
of motion becomes schrodinger-like (26) with an eective potential

note that the turning point for y  0 is now at a nite coordinate distance due to the inclusion
of a non-zero compact momenta. this has the anticipated eect of shifting the mass spectrum
upwards from that given in eq. (13). in any event, one can verify that for m 2 < 0 the potential
is everywhere positive and so the schrodinger equation yields no normalizable zero-energy
solutions. hence, since the spectrum has m 2 > 0 for all of these spin-two modes, they clearly

20

do not present any diculty for the stability of the ads soliton. finally, we also note that
the above results are again identical to that for the massless, minimally coupled scalar in the
case that internal momentum is included. the the spectra of these two set of modes remains
identical when one allows for nontrivial  -dependence.

next we consider the vector modes with nontrivial  -dependence. in this case, the ansatz
for the polarization of eq. (29) had to be modied as well. using the transverse gauge condition
(73) in the rest frame, a consistent ansatz is given by

h i =

r2
l2 h(r), hti = 

q
m

r2
l2 h(r), hri = 

q
m

r2
l2 a(r)

(77)

for some i  {1, . . . , p  1}, and all other components of hab are zero. consistency of this
ansatz in the equations of motion (17) requires that

a(r) =

rp+1 (1 + q2/m 2)  rp+1

redening the radial prole according to h(r) = (r)(r) with

(78)

(79)

and then making the usual change of variables, r = r(1 + ey), leads to an eective potential of
the form,

note that this is nearly identical to eq. (32) except for the last term which is proportional to
q2. this eective potential has the following asymptotic behavior,

note that setting q = 0 in the expression for v (y  0) is not consistent. this simply reects
the fact that the two limits y   and q  0 do not commute. in any event, comparing these
limiting values to those of eq. (33) one sees in a 1
m expansion that a non-vanishing compact
momenta will lead to a larger mass gap than in the q = 0 case. alternatively, one can show that
the potential is positive everywhere for m 2 < 0, and hence there are no tachyonic excitations.
that is the ads soliton is perturbatively stable against these vector modes with nontrivial
 -dependence.

finally, we consider the scalar modes for which the ansatz for the polarization must be
extended beyond that in eq. (37). again, the transversality constraint (73) and consistency of
the equations of motion guide us in constructing the following ansatz

i, j = 1, ..., p  1

h  (r) = 
hij(r) =

htt(r) =

hrr(r) =
hrt(r) = im d(r)
h t(r) = 
h  (r)
h r(r) = iq e(r)

q
m

where f (r) is the function appearing in the metric (1), while c(r), d(r) and e(r) are functions
xed by consistency of the equations of motion (17). when q = 0, this ansatz corresponds
to the polarization in eq. (37) with b(r) = 0. substituting the ansatz into the linearized
einstein equations (17), one can eliminate the functions c(r), d(r), e(r) in terms of h(r) and
its derivatives to obtain a single second order equation for h(r). next one redenes the radial
prole by h(r) = (r)(r) with

and changes to the y coordinate as before. in the end, (r) satises the schrodinger equation
with the eective potential

(84)

one can easily see that setting q = 0 in this expression reproduces the result in eq. (43). this
potential behaves in the asymptotic regions as

(p + 1)2

p(p + 2)

ey +  3p(p + 2)
v (y  0) =
v (y  0) =   2p(p + 2)q2 + (7p  10)(p + 1)m 2

note that in this case, the two limits y   and q  0 do commute for the present
calculations. once again it can be seen that to leading order in 1
m the potential near the
interior turning point is increased by the inclusion of a non-zero value of the compact momentum
however the turning point remains at y = . further one can show again that there are no
tachyonic excitations since the potential is everywhere positive for m 2 < 0. hence as expected,
these scalar modes do not yield any instabilities for the ads soliton when one allows for a
nontrivial  -dependence.
