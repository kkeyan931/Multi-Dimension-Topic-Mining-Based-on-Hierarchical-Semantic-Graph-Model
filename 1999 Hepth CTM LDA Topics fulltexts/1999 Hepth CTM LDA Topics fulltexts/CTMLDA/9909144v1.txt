abstract

we present some multiplets of n = 2 o-shell supergravity in ve dimensions. one
is the super yang-mills multiplet, another one is the linear multiplet. the latter one is
used to establish a general action formula from which we derive an action for the super
yang-mills multiplet. the super yang-mills multiplet is used to construct the nonlinear
multiplet with gauged su(2). this nonlinear multiplet and the action formula for the
yang-mills multiplet enable us to write down an su(2) gauged supergravity which we
nally truncate to arrive at gauged supergravity with gauge group so(2).

1 introduction

in a recent paper [1] we have presented an o-shell formulation of n = 2 supergravity in ve
spacetime dimensions. our construction started from globally supersymmetric yang-mills
theory from which we derived the multiplet of currents. by dualizing this multiplet we ob-
tained the linearized transformation rules of the minimal multiplet which we subsequently
completed to the full, nonlinear ones. the eld content of this multiplet is listed in table
1. the propagating elds are the vielbein ea
m, the gravitino m and the graviphoton am.

table 1: field content of the minimal multiplet in d = 5.

besides these elds some auxilliary elds are needed which ensure the matching of bosonic
and fermionic degrees of freedom o the mass shell. as can be seen from the table, the
o-shell extension requires all in all 40 + 40 components. since at least 48 + 48 components
are needed in order to construct a supergravity lagrangian, 8 + 8 components are missing.
these 8 + 8 components were added to the theory by introducing the nonlinear multiplet.
furthermore, using this multiplet, we were able to break the su(2) automorphisms which
were gauged by the auxilliary eld ~vm to a global su(2), leading to an o-shell lagrangian
of supergravity.

in this note we continue the construction of locally supersymmetric o-shell theories
in d = 5. we use the minimal formulation throughout, i.e. with unbroken su(2) and
40 + 40 components. at the end, the nonlinear multiplet is introduced leading to the
desired lagrangians. our nal result will be gauged supergravity, i.e. ads supergravity
(for a recent review on supersymmetry in ads space, see [2]). in principle there are two
possible versions of gauged supergravities:

the rst one consists in gauging the complete automorphism group by introducing an
additional super yang-mills multiplet with gauge group su(2). the resulting su(2) 
su(2) is then broken to a residual su(2) which gauges the complete automorphisms,
where in contradistinction to the minimal case, the gauge eld is now propagating. we
will not present the explicit lagrangian but explain in some detail its construction.

table 2: field content of the super yang-mills multiplet in d = 5. the index a is a gauge
group index.

the second formulation of gauged supergravity uses the graviphoton am belonging to
the supergravity multiplet to gauge an so(2) subgroup of the automorphism group. the
resulting theory contains a cosmological constant. the lagrangian will be presented in
section 4.

the plan for this note is as follows.

in the next section we nd the transformation
laws of the locally supersymmetric yang-mills multiplet. in section 3 the linear multiplet
is presented. it allows the construction of a general action formula which is used to nd
an action for the super yang-mills multiplet. in section 4 we move on to the main topic
of this work, the construction of gauged supergravity. this requires the inclusion of a
nonabelian gauge symmetry in the nonlinear multiplet is presented there. finally, we give
the lagrangian for o-shell supergravity in anti de sitter space.

2 the super yang-mills multiplet

the eld content of the super yang-mills multiplet is given in table 2. we found the
locally supersymmetric transformation laws starting from the rigid ones which are given
in [3] by imposing the commutator algebra of the minimal multiplet, i.e. the multiplet
containing 40+40 components as constructed in our recent work [1]. one nds that this
algebra has to be modied. in addition to the terms given there, a eld dependent gauge
transformation appears in the commutator of two supersymmetry transformations:

[q(), q()] = . . . + gauge(ig mba

m  ig m a).

(2.1)

the dots represent the eld dependent transformations of [1], gauge() is a gauge transfor-
mation with parameter  and g is the gauge coupling constant which has (mass-) dimension
1/2 in ve dimensions.

the next step would be to construct an action for this multiplet. however, as will turn
out and as expected from the four dimensional case [4], this action is rather complicated.
to circumvent its direct construction, it is useful to construct rst the linear multiplet,
for which an action is easily found. since a certain combination of elds belonging to the
super yang-mills multiplet forms a linear multiplet, this formula can then be used to give
an action for the super yang-mills multiplet, as will be discussed at the end of the next
section.

3 the linear multiplet

the linear multiplet is a useful device for the construction of invariant actions [5]. since
the highest component of this multiplet is a scalar n which transforms in the globally
supersymmetric case into a total derivative, an invariant is given by

z d5x n.

this relation is easily extended to the locally supersymmetric case. it will be shown below,
following the construction in the four dimensional case [4], that a certain combination of

table 3: field content of the linear multiplet in d = 5. the subtracted degree of freedom
of the vectoreld is due to the constraint (3.1).

components of the minimal multiplet as constructed in [1] forms a linear multiplet, so that
knowing an action for the linear multiplet, an action for the minimal multiplet is known,
too. furthermore, the super yang-mills multiplet can be embedded in a similar manner
in the linear multiplet which will simplify the construction of an action for this multiplet
considerably.

the complete eld content of the linear multiplet is given in table 3.

it contains a
vector which is conserved in the rigid supersymmetric limit, i.e.   w = 0. of course, this
constraint will be modied in the locally supersymmetric case; its actual form is given in
eq. (3.1).

in the globally supersymmetric limit, the linear multiplet is dual to the maxwell mul-

tiplet, i.e. by requiring invariance of the coupling term 2

z d5x(cid:16)baw a + mn + i   ~x ~y(cid:17)

we deduced the rigid transformation laws of the linear multiplet which were then completed
to the locally supersymmetric ones by enforcing the gauge algebra (2.1).

in addition, the elds may transform in a real representation of a nonabelian gauge

group. if such a gauge symmetry is included, the elds tranform like

n = iatan,

where the t a generate this representation and a is the transformation parameter. the

2from this point of view the conservation of the vector wa is a direct consequence of the fact that ba

is a gauge eld.

is invariant under supersymmetry and u(1) gauge transformations. to check the latter
symmetry the constraint (3.1) has to be used. note the formal similarity of this action
with the four dimensional result [4].

as stated above, a certain combination of elds belonging to the minimal multiplet

forms a linear multiplet. the exact correspondence is

using this relation in (3.2) leads to the action for the minimal multiplet given in [1].

as for the minimal multiplet it is also possible for the super yang-mills multiplet of
the preceding section to nd certain combinations of elds which form the components of a
linear multiplet. since we know an action formula for this multiplet, eq. (3.2), we can nd
in this way an action for the super yang-mills multiplet. because the exact correspondence
is rather complicated, we give only the lowest dimensional eld of the linear multiplet:

(~y ab, ab, n ab, w ab

(3.3)

the remaining components of this linear multiplet can then be computed by repeated
supersymmetry variation of this expression. note again the similarity of this result with
the result of breitenlohner and sohnius [4].

the next step is to project out a gauge singlet by considering the contraction of the
indices a and b in (3.3). we write this as a trace. the lagrangian density for the super

(3.4)

note the appearance of a term linear in c (the last term in the second line), as expected
from the counting of degrees of freedom. as in the pure supergravity case, this eld has
to be replaced using the nonlinear multiplet.

4 gauged supergravity

as discussed in the introduction, there are two possibilities for gauged supergravity. first,
one can gauge the complete automorphisms by introducing in addition to the supergravity
multiplet an su(2) vector multiplet. the second posssibility is to gauge an so(2) subgroup
of the su(2), where the gauge eld of the so(2) is the graviphoton, which belongs to the
supergravity multiplet. we will discuss the rst possibility only roughly, following the
pioneering work of de wit, [6]. for the second possibility , i.e. ads supergravity, we will
present detailed formulas. our strategy in this case follows closely the work of de wit et
al. on four dimensional conformal supergravity, [7].

to gauge the automorphism group of the supersymmetry algebra we have to return to
the nonlinear multiplet which has been constructed in [1]. its components are listed in
table 4. a constraint of the form av a + . . . = 0 was required to render this multiplet
supersymmetric. the index  of i
 transformed under global su(2) transformations.
the rst step towards gauged supergravity is to gauge this su(2) by introducing a super
yang-mills multiplet with components

where the arrows denote the 3 of su(2) and the tilde on
morphism group su(2). to gauge the su(2), the derivatives acting on i
 which appear
in various transformation laws of elds belonging to the nonlinear multiplet have to be
replaced by gauge covariant derivatives:

however, imposing the commutator algebra with the modication due to the extra su(2)
given in eq. (2.1) on the nonlinear multiplet requires further modications of the transfor-
mation laws. these are (besides the implicit replacements of the derivatives by covariant
derivatives, cf. (4.2), and various supercovariantizations):

so that new = old + . furthermore, the constraint of the nonlinear multiplet as given

variantizations there appear also extra terms:

(4.3)

the dots represent again the terms already present in [1] and for clarity we have given the
cterm.

to gauge the complete su(2) automorphism group with a propagating eld one should
proceed as follows. first, one has to plug in the modied constraint (4.3) in the super

9

yang-mills lagrangian (3.4). next, the su(2)  su(2) is broken to a residual su(2) by
choosing

i

 = i
.

(4.4)

to maintain this gauge, a eld dependent su(2) transformation with parameter

~ = 2~  + ~

has to be added to the transformation laws of the elds. here ~ is the transformation
parameter of the su(2). as a consequence, there are now two elds, ~bm and ~vm, trans-
forming as gauge elds of the residual su(2). further, there is a derivative term   in
the supersymmetry transformation law of ~vm. all this can be remedied by redening

m = ~vm  g ~bm + 2 m~ 
~b 

(4.5)

~b 

m is now inert under gauge transformations and of auxilliary dimension.

to gauge an so(2) subgroup of the su(2) automorphism group one could proceed by

setting

~ =

~ex = 0,

~m =

1
2

(0, 1, 0)t ,

~bm =r 2

3

(0, am, 0)t .

(4.6)

inspection of the supersymmetry transformation laws for the super yang-mills multiplet
(2.2) shows that this choice is supersymmetric. furthermore, one should perform the
following redenitions which lead to canonical kinetic terms:

 =  +

abbrab,

v 
ab = vab

23bfab.

(4.7)

however, a shortcut of this procedure is to start by imposing (4.6) and the redenitions
(4.7) rst. after having replaced the c eld in the lagrangian by the constraint (4.3) and
having chosen the gauge (4.4), the original su(2)  su(2) is broken to so(2). to stay in
the gauge (4.4), an su(2) transformation with parameter

~ = 2~  + (0, 2, 0)t

has to be addded to the supersymmetry transformation laws. again, as in the case with
gauged su(2) discussed above, there are now two elds which transform as gauge elds
for the so(2), namely v 2

m and am. to get rid of this, we dene a new vectoreld

m = ~vm  gr2

~v 

(0, am, 0)t  2 m~ 

which is inert under the so(2). after replacing
