abstract

we compare two opposite ways of performing a 3d reduction of the
two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation beyond the instantaneous approxi-
mation and salpeters equation. the more usual method consists in per-
forming an expansion around an instantaneous approximation of the prod-
uct of the free propagators (propagator-approximated reduction). the
second method starts with an instantaneous approximation of the bethe-
salpeter kernel (kernel-approximated reduction). in both reductions the
nal 3d potential can be obtained by following simple modied feynman
rules. the kernel-approximated reduction, however, does not give the cor-
rect scattering amplitudes, and must thus be limited to the computation
of bound states.

our 3d reduction of the three-fermion bethe-salpeter equation is in-
spired by these results. we expand this equation around positive-energy
instantaneous approximations of the three two-body kernels, but these
starting approximations are given by propagator-approximated reductions
at the two-body level. the three-fermion bethe-salpeter equation is rst
transformed into a set of three coupled equations for three wave functions
depending each on one two-fermion total energy, then into a set of three
3d equations and nally into a single 3d equation. this last equation
is rather complicated, as it combines three series expansions, but we use
it to write a manageable expression of the rst-order corrections to the
energy spectrum.

the bethe-salpeter equation [1, 2] is the usual tool for the study of relativis-
tic bound states. the principal diculty in the treatment of this equation
comes from the existence of unphysical relative time variables. in the two-body
bethe-salpeter equation the simplest way of eliminating the (in this case single)
relative time variable consists in performing an instantaneous approximation
of the bethe-salpeter kernel (kernel-approximated reduction): one replaces the
complicated kernel given by eld theory by a simpler expression, independent
of the initial and nal relative energies in the momentum space representation.
a 3d equation (salpeters equation [3] ) follows immediately. it is also possible
to get salpeters equation from an instantaneous approximation of the product
of the two free propagators: one replaces this product by a 3d propagator times

2

a delta (the constraint) xing the relative energy (propagator-approximated
reduction).

the derivation of salpeters equation using a kernel-approximated reduction
appears to be the most natural one. for the calculation of the higher-order
correction terms (towards a theoretical equivalence with the original bethe-
salpeter equation, at least for what concerns the bound state energy spectrum),
the propagator-approximated reduction has been preferred by most authors [4-
19] including us [17, 18, 19]. we found an example of a kernel-approximated
reduction in articles by phillips and wallace [20], who tune their instantaneous
approximation of the kernel in order to make the corrections vanish up to a
given order. it is however our tentative of 3d reducing the three-fermion bethe-
salpeter equation [21] which led us to consider this alternative approach (see
below).

this work is divided into two parts. in the rst part we present the two 3d
reduction methods of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation. we do not insist
on the propagator-approximation reduction as we already closely examinated
it elsewhere [17, 18, 19], and we focus on the kernel-approximated reduction,
comparing it with the other method.

we meet a rst diculty coming from the fact that the kernel-approximated
reduction does not lead directly to an symmetric potential.
in the case of a
total-energy depending potential like here, this does not necessarily imply that
the nal energy spectrum will not be real. it is however interesting to get a 3d
equation with a symmetric potential by performing a supplementary expansion.
the resulting double expansion (triple if we consider also the higher-order irre-
ducible graphs contributing to the kernel) does not complicate the enumeration
of the contributions. it is indeed possible, as in the propagator-approximated
reduction, to get the nal potential by slightly modifying the feynman rules
used in the calculation of the 4d o mass shell transition operator.

the most concise way of presenting the two reduction methods consists in
writing their respective 3d o mass shell transition operators in terms of the cor-
responding 4d o mass shell transition operator of eld theory. two reductions
which share the same 3d o mass shell transition operator correspond indeed
to 3d equations which can be transformed into each other at the 3d level. in
the propagator-approximated reduction, the 3d operator is obtained from the
4d one by applying a constraint which is also satised by the free solutions, so
that the corresponding 3d equation gives not only the bound states, but also
the correct physical scattering amplitudes, although the original homogeneous
bethe-salpeter equation was only valid for bound states. we loose this bonus
with the kernel-approximated reduction.

we close this rst part with the calculation of the second-order contributions
to the 3d potential using the kernel-approximated reduction method, in the case
of a simple kernel given by a one-photon exchange graph (in feynman gauge).
each term is given by the residues of two poles in the initial and nal relative-

3

energy complex planes. the poles can come from the propagators only, or one
of them can come from the kernel. the contributions of the kernel poles are not
negligeable, at least in this case. beyond the ladder approximation, however,
they could be partially cancelled by the contributions of the rst crossed term.

in a recent work [21], we proposed a three-fermion bethe-salpeter equation with
three instantaneous, cluster-energy independent and positive-energy kernels.
such an equation can easily be transformed, without supplementary approx-
imation or perturbation expansion, into a 3d equation. the instantaneous two-
body kernels were chosen in order to reproduce the two-body potentials obtained
with a propagator-approximated reduction in the pure two-body case. with this
choice, our 3d equation satises a cluster separability requirement: switch-
ing o two of the three mutual interactions leads to a free equation for one
fermion, plus a 3d equation for the two other fermions, equivalent to the exact
bethe-salpeter equation for these two fermions. the remaining discrepancy (at
least in the predicted energy spectrum) between the exact three-fermion bethe-
salpeter equation and our three-fermion 3d equation must then be considered
as a three-body relativistic eect, the computation of which is the purpose of
the second part of the present work. around a positive-energy instantaneous
approximation of the three two-body kernels (the three-body irreducible terms
being entierely included in the perturbation), we perform three consecutive ex-
pansions of the correction terms: the three-fermion bethe-salpeter equation is
rst transformed into a set of three coupled equations for three wave functions
depending each on one two-fermion total energy, then into a set of three 3d
equations and nally into a single 3d equation. the resulting expression for
the 3d equation is rather complicated, as it combines three series expansions,
but we use it to write a manageable expression of the rst-order corrections to
the energy spectrum. the contributions of the poles of the propagators to this
energy shift are easy to compute in terms of the bethe-salpeter kernels with
two of the three fermions on their mass shell, in the spirit of gross spectator
model [22, 23]. the contributions of the singularities of the kernels themselves
(which could be important) remain to be computed but this should be done in
the framework of more specic models.

what about cluster separability? we should not be surprised by uncor-
rect cluster-separated limits, as the three-fermion homogeneous bethe-salpeter
equation is valid only for three-body bound states. correct limits would again
be a bonus. the cluster-separated limits of our 3d equation are two-fermion 3d
equations built with the potentials corresponding to the starting instantaneous
two-body kernels. they are thus correct if these potentials are the full poten-
tials corresponding to reductions of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation.
another choice, like that based on the simpler born approximation, would lead
to a 3d equation whith uncorrect cluster separated limits, but could still be
used in the computation of three-fermion bound states.

2 the two-fermion problem.

2.1 notations.

we shall write the bethe-salpeter equation for the bound states of two fermions
[1] as

 = g0k,

(1)

where  is the bethe-salpeter amplitude, function of the positions x1, x2 or of
the momenta p1, p2 of the fermions (according to the chosen representation).
the operator k is the bethe-salpeter kernel, given in a non-local momentum
representation by the sum of the irreducible two-fermion feynman graphs. the
operator g0 is the free propagator, given by the product g0
2 of the two
individual fermion propagators

where the hi are the dirac free hamiltonians of eigenstates ei :

hi = ~i .~pi + i mi

(i = 1, 2).

we shall dene the total (or external, cm, global) and relative (or internal)
variables:

and give a name to the corresponding combinations of the free hamiltonians:

s = h1 + h2 ,

s =

(h1  h2).

(7)

2.2 3d reduction using an instantaneous approximation

of the propagator.

the free propagator g0 will be approached by a carefully chosen expression g,
combining a constraint xing the relative energy, and a global 3d propagator.
there exists an innity of possible combinations [4-19] which would be equiv-
alent if all correction terms could be computed. our choice in this work will
be

g = ++z dp0 g0(p0) = 2i (p0 s) ++ g0 12.

(8)

5

where ++ is the free positive-energy projector:

ij = i

1j
2,



i =

ei  hi

2ei

.

and g0 the 3d propagator:

g0 =

1

p0  s + i

(9)

(10)

this choice of g is not necessarily the best one for working in the pure two-
fermion framework, but it is the simplest one for the presentation of our two
and three-fermion results. we shall write the free propagator as the sum of the
approached propagator, plus a remainder:

g0 = g + gr.

the bethe-salpeter equation becomes then the inhomogeneous equation

 = g0k = (g + gr) k  =  + grk,

with

 = gk.

(11)

(12)

(13)

solving (formally) the inhomogeneous equation (12) and putting the result into
(13), we get

 = gk(1  grk)1 = gk t 

(14)

where

obeys

k t = k(1  grk)1 = k + kgrk + ... = (1  kgr)1k

(15)

k t = k + kgrk t = k + k t grk.

(16)

the reduction series (15) re-introduces in fact the reducible graphs into the
bethe-salpeter kernel, but with g0 replaced by gr. equation (14) has the
same bound state spectrum as the original bethe-salpeter equation.

in the inversion of (1grk) and similar operators below, we have to assume
that eq. (1grk) = 0 has no solution for the values of p0 considered (i.e.
the values belonging to the bound state energy spectrum of the bethe-salpeter
equation).

the relative energy dependence of eq. (14) can be easily eliminated:

and  obeys:

 = (p0 s) 

 = g0 v t 

6

(17)

(18)

where v t is proportional to the positive-energy part of k t with the initial
and nal relative energies xed to s :

v t = 2i ++ 12k t (s, s) ++.

in less compact but more precise notations:

12k t (s, s)  z dp

0, p0)(p0 s).

0dp0(p

0 s)12k t (p

(19)

(20)

note that we write (p

0, p0) but (s, s), as we keep s in operator form.

these 3d reductions can also be described in terms of transition operators.

the 4d transition operator is

t = k + k g0 k +   

(21)

and k t can be obtained by keeping only the gr part of g0 in it. we have
also

t = k(1g0k)1 = k(1grkgk)1 = k(1grk)1(1gk(1grk)1)1

= k t (1gk t )1 = k t + k t gk t +   

so that the 3d transition operator is given by

v t + v t g0 v t +    = 2i12 t g

(22)

(23)

with

t g = k t ++(s, s) + k t ++(s, s) g k t ++(s, s) +    = t ++(s, s)

(24)

k t ++(s, s) = 12 ++ 12k t (s, s) ++ =

1
2i
t ++(s, s) = 12 ++ 12 t (s, s) ++.

12v t

(25)

(26)

we see that the 3d transition operator is a constrained form of that of eld
theory. both operators become equal to the physical scattering amplitude when
both fermions are on their positive-energy mass shells. conversely:

t = k t + k t gk t + k t g(k t + k t gk t +   )gk t

= k t + k t gk t + k t g t g gk t .

(27)

a bethe-salpeter equation leading directly to the same 3d reduction can be
obtained by replacing the kernel k by the instantaneous positive-energy ker-
nel k t ++(s, s). in this case the 4d transition operator t becomes equal to
t ++(s, s) = t g.

7

the rst-order correction term to the energy is

p0  p (0)

0 = 2i < ++ 12 (kgrk)(s, s) ++ > .

(28)

we must not forget that p (0)
, (kgrk)(s, s) and the zero-order wave func-
tions are in general total energy dependent, so that (28) is in fact a numerical
equation in p0 (or a matricial equation in case of degenerescence). if the p0
dependence of the zero-order potential is of higher-order, one has only to take
the p0 dependence of p (0)

into account.

2.3 3d reduction using an instantaneous approximation

of the kernel.

we shall now consider an approximation of the bethe-salpeter kernel:

the bethe-salpeter equation becomes

k = k 0 + k r.

 = g0k 0 + g0k r

 = (1  g0k r)1g0k 0 = gk k 0

(29)

(30)

(31)

with

gk = g0 + g0k rg0 + g0k rg0k rg0 +     g0 + gkr .

(32)

if we now specialize k 0 to an instantaneous positive-energy kernel (k 0 inde-
pendent of p0 and equal to 12++12k 0++ ), eq. (31) leads to the 3d
equation

 = (g0 + gkr ) v 

(33)

(34)

(35)

with

 = ++z dp0 (p0),
++ z dp

1
2i

gkr = 

v = 2i 12k 0,

0 dp0 gkr(p

0, p0) 12 ++.

the rst-order energy shift is, with the replacement gkrv   gkr(p0 s) :

1
2i

0 = 

p0p (0)

< (p 0s)z dp

0 dp0 g0(p

0, p0)g0(p0) 12 (p 0s) > .
(36)
here again, all elements of (36) are total energy-dependent. although (36)
is symmetric, the perturbation potential (p0  s)gkrv of (33) is not. this
does not exclude the possibility of a real energy spectrum:
if we admit an
energy dependence of the potential (which we can not avoid), we have also

0)k r(p

8

the possibility of performing an innity of rearrangements of the equation. we
can for example render the potential symmetric by expanding eq. (33) in the
same way as eq.
(12) of section (2.2). we can equivalently start with the
corresponding 4d equation (31):

 = (g0 + gkr) k 0 =  + gkr k 0

 = g0k 0 = g0k 0(1  gkr k 0)1  = g0k k 

where

k k = k 0 + k 0gkrk 0 +   

(37)

(38)

(39)

is a symmetric positive-energy instantaneous potential, since it begins and ends
with k 0 . the 3d equation is then

 = g0 v k ,

v k = 2i 12 k k ,

 =z dp0  (p0)

(40)

and the rst-order energy shift is still given by (36). as for the propagator-
approximated reduction, we can represent the various contributions by feynman
graphs. we can indeed get k k by considering the transition operator

t = (k 0 + k r ) + (k 0 + k r ) g0 (k 0 + k r ) +   

(41)

and skipping some terms according to the two rules:

 each term must begin and end with k 0
 there must be at least one k r between two consecutive k 0.

the 3d transition operator is now 2i12t k with

t k = k k + k k g0k k +    = k k(1  g0k k)1

= k 0(1  gkrk 0)1(1  g0k 0(1  gkrk 0)1)1
= k 0(1  gkrk 0  g0k 0)1 = k 0(1  gk k 0)1

= k 0(1  (1  g0k r )1g0k 0 )1

= k 0(1  g0k r  g0k 0 )1(1  g0k r ) = k 0(1  g0k )1(1  g0k r )

replacing then k r by k k 0 and t (1g0k) by k gives

k 0(1 + g0t ) (1  g0k r )

t k = k 0 + k 0g0k 0 + k 0g0 t g0k 0.

(42)

(43)

in contrast with what happens in the propagator-approximated reductions, the
on mass shell restriction of this operator is not the physical scattering amplitude
of eld theory. in fact, the bethe-salpeter equation (1), without inhomogeneous
term, is a bound state equation, and for the bound states we are only interested
in the poles of (43). these poles are the poles of t, unless the integrations on

9

p
0, p0 make some residues vanish. getting also the correct physical scattering
amplitudes was a welcome bonus of the propagator-approximated reductions.

if we want t in terms of t k, we can write (42) as

t k(1  g0k r )1 = k 0(1 + g0t ) = (k  k r )(1 + g0t )

= t  k r (1 + g0t ) = (1  k r g0 )t  k r

t = (1  k r g0 )1 t k (1  g0k r )1 + (1  k r g0 )1 k r

= (1 + t rg0) t k (1 + g0t r) + t r

with

we have a large freedom in the choice of k 0. we could choose

t r = k r + k rg0k r +    .

k 0 = 12 ++ 12 k(s, s) ++.

(44)

(45)

(46)

(47)

we could also keep only the ladder term of k, or a part of it in (47), like the
coulomb part of the one-photon exchange contribution. we could use k t (in
this case we expect that the remainder of k k does not nally contribute to the
total energy spectrum) or an approximation of it (one and two photon exchange
terms, for example). phillips and wallace [20] suggested to choose k 0 in order
to annihilate gkr exactly or up to a given order. if we choose to annihilate it
at rst-order, the rst-order energy shift (36) vanishes and we get

k 0 =

1
(2)2

12 (g0)1++z dp

0, p0)g0(p0) 12 (g0)1++.
(48)
the skipping of terms in (41) is then improved, as we must now have at last
two k r between two consecutive k 0. if we choose to annihilate gkr exactly,
we get, using (45), (35) and the relation gkr = g0t rg0 :

0 dp0 g0(p

0)k(p

0)t (p

1
(2)2

0 dp0 g0(p

12 (g0)1++z dp

0, p0)g0(p0) 12 (g0)1++ = t k
(49)
which is the ++ projection of the expression given in [20] (they use salpeters
propagator and write thus ++ instead of ++ ). in this case, t k gives
the correct physical scattering amplitudes when p 0  e1+e2, as the operators
(g0)1 kill the contributions of the singularities other than the poles of g0.

2.4 one-photon exchange.

let us now compute (48) with k given by the one-photon exchange graph, in
feynman gauge:

k =

p0  p10  e2 + i

(51)

performing the integration in p10 by closing the integration path clockwise, we
get the residues of the poles at p10 = e

(52)

the possibility of k0 being equal to e
1e1, leading to a double pole, has been
taken into account by leaving an interval of length  around this value in order
to take the   0 limit afterwards. this can also be done by replacing the
1e1  k0  i)1 by their principal parts, or equivalently by adding
poles (e
a i(k0  e
1 + e1) to each one. for the integral in k0 we shall close the
integration path counterclockwise in the rst term and clockwise in the second
one. in each case we shall have a pole of the propagator at k0 = e
1e1 (the 
reduces the contribution of this pole by a factor 2) and a pole of the kernel at
k0 = |~k| and k0 = |~k| respectively. the nal result is:

(53)
here again, we must take the principal parts of the poles in |~k| = |e
1e1| in the
future integrals in ~k. the rst term comes from the residues of the poles of the
propagators only, while the two other terms combine the residues of one pole
of the propagators and one pole of the kernel. closing the integration paths
in the opposite directions would interchange the two fermions in the rst term
and modify the two other terms accordingly. at lowest order, the expression
between brackets becomes

1e1)2~k2 replaced by simply ~k2 (coulomb
to the rst term of (53) with (e
potential). we see anyway that the relative time dependence of the kernel
contibutes more to (53) via the residues of its poles than directly. we should
however consider also the contribution of the lowest-order crossed graph, which
could partially cancel (53). we know indeed that, in well chosen propagator-
approximated reductions, all higher-order contributions cancel mutually at the
one-body limit [15, 18].

3 the three-fermion problem.

3.1 three-fermion bethe-salpeter equation.

the bethe-salpeter equation is now:

where k123 is the sum of the purely three-body irreducible contributions. let
us rst consider the case of three two-body positive-energy, instantaneous and
cluster-energy independent interactions k 0

and independent of p
ij0, pij0, pij0 ). the bethe-salpeter equation becomes in
this case

this leads to a set of three coupled integral equations in the ij. we shall search
for solutions analytical in the im(pk0) < 0 half planes and close the integration
paths clockwise in these planes. the only singularities will then be the poles of
the free propagators. performing the integrations with respect to the pij0 gives
then

and similarly for 23 and 31 (from now on, we shall often write the equations
for the (12) pair only, understanding the two other equations obtained by cir-
cular permutations on the ijk indexes). solving (58) with respect to 12(p30)
gives a wave function which is analytical in the im(p30) < 0 half plane, and
conrms thus the existence of such solutions. furthermore, equation (58) shows
that the three projections +

the 3d equation

in order to recover, at the three 2+1 separated clusters limits, the propagator-
approximated 3d reductions (subsection 2.2 above).

for the general three-fermion bethe-salpeter equation (55) it seemed to be
a good idea to try an expansion around a set of positive-energy instantaneous
approximations of the two-body kernels. we rst tried to start with approxi-
mations giving the 3d equation (59) in a more direct way than above, like

with k 0
12 given by (61). the zero-order 3d equation is in each case (59), but the
correction terms spoil the result: with (62) or (63) they contain supplementary
zero-order contributions. with (64) they contain no supplementary zero-order
contributions, but the correction terms can not easily be sorted by increasing
order. we must thus proceed more carefully. we nally decided to start with a
positive-energy, instantaneous and cluster-energy independent approximations
of the two-body kernels, like (61) or its born approximation, adding the third
+
k projector in order to avoid unnecessary complications, and to proceed in
three steps, inspired by the demonstration (55)-(59):

i) transform the bethe-salpeter equation (55) into a set of three coupled

equations for the ij(pk0).

ii) transform this set into a set of three coupled 3d equations for the ij(hk)

(these are not the faddeev equations).

iii) transform this last set into a single 3d equation for , dened as the

mean of the ij(hk).

3.2 three coupled equations for three cluster-energy de-

pending amplitudes.

let us rst write the bethe-salpeter equation (55) in a more compact form:

with

(65)

(66)

k = (g0

3)1k12 + (g0

1)1k23 + (g0

2)1k31 + k123.

(67)

with these notations, we can formally perform the same manipulations as in
the two-fermion problem (subsection 2.3):

k = k 0 + k r

 = g0k 0 + g0k r

 = (1  g0k r)1g0k 0 = gk k 0

(68)

(69)

(70)

with

gk = g0 + g0k rg0 + g0k rg0k rg0 +     g0 + gkr.

(71)

since eq. (70) ends with k 0, we can transform it into a set of three coupled
equations for the ij(pk0), using the denition (57):

12(p

30) = xk z dpk0 gk

12,ij (p

3.3 three coupled 3d equations.

the product of propagators (75) will be included in a clockwise path integral
in p10, to which only the pole of g0
1(p10) at p10 = h1 contributes. this is no
more true in the general case, but we can isolate a part of g0
1(p10) which leads
to the same result:

g0

1(p10) = g

1(p10) + gr

if we neglect the last term of (82) the two preceding terms vanish also by
integration, and we recover the result of the positive-energy instantaneous ap-
proximation. we shall thus move the rst term of (82) to the left-hand side,
consider the two next terms (second line) as the principal contributions, and
the three last terms as perturbations. the dierence between this approach
and that based on (64) lies in the fact that we do not replace immediately p
by h3 in the rst term. we get

in matricial form. we shall dene

the action of the projector  on m 0 is

 m 0 = m 0, m 0  =

v = v12 + v23 + v31.

(92)

we shall now transform the matricial equation (91) into a scalar equation for

  =  m ( 1 + m + m m +   )  

(93)

in which m = m r. taking the scalar product with u leads nally to

in this equation, v contains the projector +++ at left and at right, while
m r contains it at right. we can thus trivially transform (94) into an equation
for +++.

3.5 first-order energy shift.

the 3d reduction above is rather complicated, since it implies three levels of
series expansions. the computation of the rst-order energy shift remains how-
ever tractable. the energy shift is, keeping only the terms which contribute at
rst-order:

p0  p (0)

0 = < (p0  s)

u ( 1 + m 0 ) m r u > .

(95)

we can make the replacements

1 + m 0 = 1 + m 0

as the contributions of the rst and third terms cancel mutually. we remain

are then easy to compute, as gij(pk0) in (101) is to be taken at pk0 = hk. we

12 with the initial fermion a, the
nal fermion b and the spectator fermion 3 on their positive-energy mass shells.
we have to consider 9 terms in 4 dierent groups:

12 we denote 2i12k r

k = k = 3
k = 1 or 2, k = 3
k = 3, k = 1 or 2
k = 1 or 2 , k = 1 or 2

ba = 11, 12, 21 or 22

ba = k1 or k2
ba = 1 k or 2 k

ba = kk

we still have some freedom in the choice of ba which we could use to get
a real energy shift, for example by choosing a = b in the three rst groups.
the contributions of an instantaneous part k ri
12 would sum into a
< v ri
12. the corrections
corresponding to the dierences between the various v rba
are a step towards
gross spectator model [22, 23].

12 > but we could also include this k ri

12 directly in k 0

12 of k r

12

the principal task remains however the calculation of the contributions of
the singularities of the k r
ij , for the integration paths dened by our choices of
ab above. as we saw in section 2.4, these contributions could be as important
as these coming directly from the relative time dependence of these kernels
(they could however be partially cancelled by the contributions of two-body
non-ladder terms and three-body terms [15, 18, 22] ). a general expression
would be obtained by removing the delta part of the propagators containing
the poles considered in (103), using (73). to go further, however, we should
specialize to specic three-fermion problems. it must be noted that the ratio
gij(pk0) g1
k (pk0). if
the singularities of k r in the complex pk0 plane lie far from the positive-
energy mass shell, this ratio can be approximated by (pk0  hk)1 g1
ij (hk)
and takes a relatively low value, suggesting us to neglect the contribution of the

ij (hk) of (101) is no more 1 in the terms containing gr

18

corresponding gr

k (pk0) to (100). we could then make the replacement

vi (p0)  = 2i xk6=u

vij k(cid:2)g0

k(pk0)(cid:3)1

(pk0  hk) + xk=u

vij

(104)

in (100). we isolated the contributions of the unconnected terms k = u (like
k = 3 combined with k = 3 and k r
12 ). the resulting energy shift is now
manifestly real.

3.6 cluster separability.

physically, if we switch o the (23), (31) and (123) interactions, we are left
with a pair of interacting fermions (12) and a free fermion (3). we would like
to read this on our nal 3d equation. however:

 the cluster-separability condition may be satised by an exact 3d reduc-

tion, but not by its truncated forms.

 even with an exact 3d reduction, the cluster separability property is a wel-
come bonus, not a requirement: the bethe-salpeter equation (55), from which
we started, is indeed correct for three-fermion bound states only.

in our calculations above, the cluster-separability property is in general
spoiled by our iteration of (83), which starts with a term which vanishes at the
(12) cluster-separated limit. the (12)-limit equation is then built with the ap-
proached 2i12k 0
12 only. the cluster separability can however be restored
by performing a supplementary iteration, like our replacement of v by p0s in
(97), leading the the cluster-separable correction (103). another possibility con-
sists in our previous choice (61) of k 0
ij. with this choice, the cluster-separated
limits are exact. moreover, the corresponding two-body scattering amplitudes
are also correct. our choice (61) of k 0
ij is thus a priori the most interesting. a
simpler choice (as its born approximation) would however not be uncorrect in
the calculation of the higher-order corrections to the three-fermion bound state
spectrum.

4 conclusions

the kernel-approximated reduction is an interesting alternative to the more
usual propagator-approximated reduction, although the resulting 3d equation
is valid only for bound states.
in both cases, the 3d potentials can be ob-
tained with simple modications of the feynman rules which give the transition
operator in eld theory. further investigations on the kernel-approximated re-
ductions, with comparison with the other method (one-body limit, introduction
of an external potential, gauge invariance, numerical examples, etc...) would be
useful.

19

our 3d reduction of the three-fermion bethe-salpeter equation provides in
principle a way of progressively improving a manageable approximated 3d equa-
tion. we use it to give a manageable expression of the rst-order energy shift.
the contributions of the free propagator poles to the energy shift are easily
calculated in terms of the bethe-salpeter kernels with two of the fermions on
their mass shell, in the spirit of gross spectator model. the contributions of
the singularities of the kernels themselves should be computed in more specic
frameworks ( he3 atom, triton, three-quark systems...) and could be important,
as suggested by our computation of the rst-order energy shift in the framework
of the one-photon exchange model for the two-fermion problem.
