abstract

a quantization of (2 + 1)-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant is

presented and quantum aspects of the (2 + 1)-dimensional black holes are studied thereby.

the quantization consists of two procedures. one is related with quantization of the

asymptotic virasoro symmetry. a notion of the virasoro deformation of 3-geometry is

introduced. for a given black hole, the deformation of the exterior of the outer horizon is
.
its quantization provides unitary irreducible representations of the virasoro algebra, in

identied with a product of appropriate coadjoint orbits of the virasoro groups ddi s1

which state of the black hole becomes primary. to make the quantization complete,

holonomies , the global degrees of freedom, are taken into account. by an identication

of these topological operators with zero modes of the liouville eld, the aforementioned
unitary representations reveal, as far as c  1, as the hilbert space of this two-dimensional
conformal eld theory. this conformal eld theory, living on the cylinder at innity of the

black hole and having continuous spectrums, can recognize the outer horizon only as a

one-dimensional object in sl2(r) and realize it as insertions of the corresponding vertex

operator. therefore it can not be a conformal eld theory on the horizon. two possible

descriptions of the horizon conformal eld theory are proposed.

1 introduction

it has been proposed [1, 2, 3] that supergravity (and string theory) on adsd+1 times a compact

manifold is equivalent to a conformal eld theory living on the boundary of adsd+1. supergrav-

ity (and string theory) on asymptotically adsd+1 space-time is also expected [3] to be realized

by a boundary eld theory on a suitable vacuum.

investigations of the bulk quantum gravity, in particular, to clarify ads black holes as the

quantum gravitational states, will lead a deeper insight on our understanding of the ads/cf t

correspondence. in three dimensions, a description of gravity in terms of gauge theory [4] is

known, by which quantum gravity in three dimensions seems to be tractable and thus consid-

eration about such quantum gravitational states will become possible.

in this article we present a quantization of (2 + 1)-dimensional gravity with negative cosmo-
logical constant  = 1/l2 and thereby investigate quantum aspects of the (2 + 1)-dimensional
black holes from the perspective of the ads3/cf t2 correspondence.

the quantization consists of the following two procedures. the rst is related with quan-

tization of the asymptotic virasoro symmetry found by brown and henneaux [5]. to describe

it we introduce in section 2 a notion of the virasoro deformation of three-geometry. it is orig-

inally dened as a deformation of a suitable non-compact simply-connected region in sl2(r)

and is given by the coadjoint action of the virasoro groups ddi s1

ric from sl2(r) provides a metric of the deformed region. given a black hole, we can take,

+  ddi s1

. induced met-



as such a non-compact simply-connected region, a covering space of the exterior of the outer

horizon. its virasoro deformation commutes with the projection. therefore we can obtain a

family of the deformed quotients. this denes the virasoro deformation of the exterior of the

outer horizon of the black hole. the induced metric of the deformed region becomes that of its

quotient, which can be understood as a deformed metric of the black hole obtained in [6]. the

asymptotic virasoro symmetry turns out to be the innitesimal form of this deformation. the

family of the deformed quotients will be identied with a product of the coadjoint orbits of the

virasoro groups ddi s1

with the cosmological constant. in section 3 we provide quantization of the asymptotic vira-

labeled by mass and angular momentum of the black hole together



soro symmetry or the virasoro deformation of the exterior of the outer horizon. it is prescribed

by quantization of the corresponding coadjoint orbits. quantization of each orbit turns out to

1

give a unitary irreducible representation of the virasoro algebra with central charge c = 3l
2g .
state of the black hole becomes the primary state of the representation. all the excited states

of the representation correspond to the local excitations by the virasoro deformation, that

is, as noted in [7], gravitons. ads3 is also examined. quantization of its virasoro deforma-

tion turns out to provide a unitary irreducible representation, in which state of ads3 is the
sl2(r)+  sl2(r)-invariant primary state.

although the quantization of the virasoro deformations leads the unitary irreducible rep-

resentations of the virasoro algebra, it is not sucient as a quantization of three-dimensional
gravity. if one takes the perspective of sl2(r)+  sl2(r) chern-simons gravity [4], the vi-
rasoro deformation corresponds to local degrees of freedom of the theory and, in order to make

the quantization complete, we must take into account of the global degrees of freedom, i.e.,

holonomies. we start section 4 by discussing their quantization. having quantized holonomies,

it is very reasonable to expect from the perspective of the ads3/cf t2 correspondence that, by

an identication of these topological operators with the zero modes of a suitable two-dimensional

quantum eld, the unitary irreducible representations obtained by the quantization of the vi-

rasoro deformations could be reproduced as the hilbert space of the two-dimensional conformal
eld theory. this expectation turns out to be true at least when c  1. the holonomy vari-
ables will be identied with the zero modes of a real scalar eld x, which is interpreted as

the liouville eld. the state of ads3 is identied with the sl2(c)-invariant vacuum of this

conformal eld theory. the states of the black holes are the primary states obtained from the

vacuum by an operation of the corresponding vertex operators. excitations of the liouville

eld are equivalent with the generators of the virasoro deformation. this eld theory admits

to have continuous spectrums as expected.

having obtained the quantization of three-dimensional gravity by the liouville eld theory,

the following question may arise : how can one understand the three-dimensional black holes

in two dimensions where the liouville eld lives ? the liouville eld theory is living on a

two-sphere which is obtained by a compactication of the boundary cylinder at innity of

the black holes. to answer this question it becomes necessary to understand how the virasoro

deformation recognizes the outer horizon of the black hole. it will be shown at the end of section

4 that it recognizes the outer horizon not as a two-dimensional object but as a one-dimensional

object in sl2(r). therefore the boundary liouville eld x can see the outer horizon only as a

2

one-dimensional object. compactication of the boundary cylinder to a sphere simultaneously

makes the solid cylinder to a three-ball, by which this one-dimensional outer horizon intersects

with the boundary sphere at two points. the boundary liouville eld theory recognizes its

intersections as insertions of the corresponding vertex operator.

a microscopic description of the three-dimensional black holes has been proposed by carlip

[8] and strominger [9, 10] using a conformal eld theory on the horizon. since the virasoro de-

formation of the exterior of the outer horizon can not recognize the horizon as a two-dimensional

object, the boundary liouville eld theory can not be equivalent to the horizon conformal eld

theory. in section 5 we propose two possible descriptions of the horizon conformal eld theory.

one is a string theory in the background of a macroscopic string living in sl2(r). world-

volume of the macroscopic string should be identied with the two-dimensional outer horizon,

by which we can obtain the virasoro algebra on the horizon as its uctuation by microscopic

string. the other is a conformal eld theory which could be obtained by the virasoro deforma-

tion of the region between the inner and outer horizons of the black hole. the second possibility

seems to imply an interpretation of the conjecture made by maldacena [1], in terms of a gauge

transformation.

2 more on geometry in three dimensions

the btz black holes 1 [11] are three-dimensional black holes specied by their mass and angular
momenta. the btz black hole with mass m( 0) and angular momentum j will be denoted
by x(j,m ). one can avoid a naked singularity by imposing the bound, |j|  ml, on the allowed
value of its angular momentum. in terms of the schwarzschild coordinates (t, , r), where the
ranges are taken  < t < +, 0   < 2 and 0 < r < +, the black hole metric ds2
has the form

x(j,m )

ds2

x(j,m )  n 2(dt)2 + n2(dr)2 + r2(d + n dt)2.

n and n  are functions of the radial coordinate r and given by

where g is newton constant. in the case of ml = |j|, the black hole is called extremal. it holds
r+ = r and then the outer and inner horizons coincide with each other. when ml > |j|, it is
called non-extremal.

2.1 more on the black hole

the exterior of the outer horizon r = r+ of the btz black hole will play an important role
throughout this paper. we denote the exterior of the outer horizon of x(j,m ) by x +
x +

(j,m ) n(t, , r)  x(j,m )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) r > r+o. it is known [11, 12] that the black hole can be identied

with an appropriate quotient of sl2(r). we will need a further detailed description of this
relation between x +
in this subsection we provide it for the case of the
non-extremal black holes, that is, the case of ml > |j|. discussion presented here becomes a
prototype for the other cases, which will be treated briey in the next section.

this metric is an exact solution of the vacuum einstein equation with the negative cosmological

where 0  ,  < 2 and 0   < + 2. with this cartan decomposition one can see that
sl2(r) is topologically a solid torus. see fig.1.

of sl2(r)+  sl2(r) chern-simons gravity. to present the description, it is convenient to
introduce a mapping, sl2(r)+  sl2(r)  sl2(r), by

with this perspective, we can consider the following decomposition of h into a product of
sl2(r)-valued functions h() :

h = h(+)1

h().

(2.9)

this decomposition is equivalent to construct a pre-image of z0 in the mapping (2.7). it is

unique up to the left diagonal sl2(r) gauge transformation. this symmetry turns out to be
the three-dimensional local lorentz symmetry. given such sl2(r)-valued functions, we can
associate at sl2(r) connections a()

as follows :

(2.10)

it turns out that a0  (a(+)

the non-compact simply-connected region z0 is a covering space of x +

besides the identication of the schwarzschild angular coordinate,    + 2. see fig.3. this

using this parametrization or coordinates of z0, let us provide an explicit form of the

corresponding classical solution of the chern-simons gravity. the sl2(r)-valued function h,

which is dened in (2.8), can be read in this coordinate as

after the change of the coordinates, which can be read from (2.5) and (2.17), it coincides with

the induced metric ds2

used in the identication with the black hole becomes simple :

(w, w, )  (w + 2, w  2, ).

(2.22)

therefore we can also say that the quotient of z0 by the identication (2.22), together with

the induced metric (2.21), is identied with the exterior of the outer horizon of x(j,m ).

2.2 generalization of at connection

a generalization of the at sl2(r)+  sl2(r) connection (2.20) is examined [14, 6] to nd
a realization of the asymptotic virasoro symmetry [5] in terms of the chern-simons gravity. it

has the following form

the sux b and b label the at connections. to be consistent with the equivalence relation
(2.22), we assume that b and b are respectively real functions of w and w with 2 periodicity.

the asymptotic virasoro algebra may be realized by the following generators of the in-

in the asymptotic region they behave as   2f  f w and   2 f  f  w. these coincide

2.3 generalization of black hole

given the at connection (2.23), one can construct a metric according to the prescription of

the chern-simons gravity. denote this metric by ds2

(b,b). it has the form

(2.28)

it is also possible to obtain a region of sl2(r), analogous to z0, on which the induced metric
from sl2(r) is precisely given by (2.28). since a(+)

it is an interesting but hard task to describe the region z(b,b) explicitly. nevertheless, the
following argument shows that z(b.b) is generically dierent from z0 in sl2(r), which is enough
for our discussion in this article. we rst notice that the completion of z0 at  = 0 is achived

by adding the one-dimensional line p oq (fig.2) in sl2(r). it is a counterpart of the outer
horizon in sl2(r) 3. this can be read from the induced metric ds2
(b0,b0) of z0. the counterpart
of the horizon is located at  = 0, that is,  = 1

as regards a generic z(b,b), the analogue of the horizon will be read from the singularity of the

work,  should satisfy  > 1

of z0. (the vector elds  and  can be expected to be integrated step by step from z0 to z(b,b)
in sl2(r).) the completion of z(b,b) at  = 1
(c/6)2 will be done by adding a two-dimensional
space-like surface in sl2(r). this can be also understood from the behavior of the induced

if one identies w and w with the coordinates of circles, each deformation f b and  f
given in (2.26) can be regarded as the coadjoint action of the virasoro algebra with the central

the coadjoint orbits of b0 and b0

may be identied with the family of the regions z(b,b) of sl2(r). strictly
speaking, we should consider not z(b,b) itself but its quotient obtained by the identication
(w, w, )  (w + 2, w  2, ). this is because the information about b0 and b0, that is,
about mass and angular momentum of the black hole, is encoded not in z0 itself but, through

the parametrization (2.17), encoded in the way how to take the quotient. the actions of the

virasoro algebra are consistent with the equivalence relation used in the quotient. therefore

we can discuss about the virasoro deformation of the quotient space. let y(b,b) be the quotient
z(b,b)/ . in particular y(b0,b0) is identied with x +

the black hole x(j,m ). the virasoro groups ddi s1

it should be emphasized that the above virasoro deformation can not transform the black
hole x +
(j,m) which mass m and angular momentum j are dierent
from m and j. this can be understood by the fact that any constant shifts of b0 and b0
are not allowed in (2.26) since f and f are taken to be 2-periodic for the consistency with

the equivalence relation used in the projection . what the deformation generates are the
oscillating modes of b(w) and b( w). the deformed metric ds2
are originally the light cone coordinates (2.13).

3 3-geometries as the virasoro coadjoint orbit

3.1 coadjoint orbits of the virasoro group

the virasoro algebra is the lie algebra of the virasoro group ddi s1, which is the central
extension of di s1, the group of dieomorphisms of a circle. it consists of vector elds f (w) d
dw
on the circle together with a central element c. a general element has the form f (w) d
dw  iac
with a a real number. let us write it by the pair (f, a). the commutation relation is given by

[(f, a1), (g, a2)] =(cid:18)f g  fg,

1

48z 2

0

dw(f g  fg)(cid:19) .

(3.1)

the coadjoint representation of the virasoro algebra consists of quadratic dierentials b(w)(dw)2

together with the dual central element c. a general coadjoint vector (an element of the dual
of the virasoro algebra) has the form b(w)(dw)2 + itc with t a real number. let us denote it

by the pair (b, t). the pairing between coadjoint and adjoint vectors are given by

h(b, t), (g, a)i =

1

2z 2

0

dwb(w)g(w) + ta.

(3.2)

this is invariant under reparametrizations of the circle. the coadjoint action of the virasoro

algebra is

f (b, t) = (f b + 2fb 

t
12

f, 0),

(3.3)

where, the action of the central element being trivial, we write (f,a) as f for short. the dual

pairing (3.2) is invariant under the action of the virasoro algebra,

fh(b, t), (g, a)i = hf (b, t), (g, a)i + h(b, t), f (g, a)i

= 0,

(3.4)

where f (g, a) is given by (3.1).

as can be seen in (3.3) the dual central element c is invariant under the coadjoint action.

the value of t determines the central charge. we shall set t = 3l
(2.16) we will write this t as c. and wb0, written as w ()
b0,b0

2g . according to the denition
at the end of the previous section,

is the coadjoint orbit of (b0, c), that is, the ddi s1-orbit of (b0, c). the transformation (3.3)

also shows that wb0 is a homogeneous space of di s1. therefore we can parametrize the orbit

13

by elements of di s1 ( modulo the little group h ) : for s  di s1, letting ws = s(w), the
integrated form of (2.26) or (3.3) becomes

bs(ws)(dws)2 =(cid:20)b0 +

c

12{ws, w}(cid:21) (dw)2,
dws/dw  3

2(cid:16) d2ws/dw2
dws/dw (cid:17)2

(3.5)

. then bs provides

where {ws, w} is the schwarzian derivative, {ws, w}  d3ws/dw3
the corresponding element of wb0.

according to the kirillov-souriau-kostant theory [16], each coadjoint orbit admits to have

a canonical symplectic structure dened by the dual pairing. if one regards tangent vectors at

bs as vector elds on the circle, the symplectic form  can be described as follows :

|bs(u, v) = h(bs, c), [(u, 0), (v, 0)]i,

(3.6)

where u = u(ws), v = v(ws) denote tangent vectors at bs.

generators of the virasoro algebra are given by hamiltonian functions on wb0. if one takes

lm = ieimw d

dw , the commutation relation (3.1) becomes

[lm, ln] = (m  n)lm+n +

c
12

m3m+n,0.

the corresponding hamiltonian functions are given by

lm(s) = h(bs, c), (eimws, 0)i,

(3.7)

(3.8)

where s  di s1 is thought as the coordinate of wb0. using the prescribed symplectic structure
[16] they turn out to satisfy the (classical) virasoro algebra :

{lm, ln} = i(m  n)lm+n + i

3-geometries as the virasoro coadjoint orbit

we generalize our argument given in the previous section to the cases of the massive-extremal

and massless black holes. for each of them there appears an appropriate region z0 of sl2(r).

can deform each z0 in sl2(r). this will be described



the virasoro groups ddi s1

+  ddi s1

by the coadjoint action of the virasoro group. quotient of the deformed region, obtained in a

similar manner as the non-extremal case, provides a deformation of the exterior of the outer

14

horizon. each quotient has a metric induced from sl2(r), which is nothing but the deformed

metric of the black hole considered in [6]. the family of these quotients will be identied with

the product of the coadjoint orbits w (+)
values (j, m) of the black hole by using (2.16). we also examine the case of ads3. in this case

it becomes necessary to study gsl2(r), the universal cover of sl2(r). taking an appropriate
region of gsl2(r), it becomes possible to repeat an argument similar to the black holes. in

the equivalence relation used in the quotient (3.13) acquires the form (2.15) in these new

particular deformations of the massive-extremal black hole x +

notice that r = 0 is not a true singularity. it is merely a coordinate singularity. nevertheless,

to provide the virasoro deformation of this space which is analogous to the black holes, it is

required to consider the complement of r = 0 rather than the whole. actually this complement
is an analogue of x +

sl2(r) has a topologically nontrivial circle. the universal cover gsl2(r) can be obtained
by making this s1 to a line. this is equivalent to a simple change of the identication of w and
w in the cartan decomposition into an identication, (w, w)  (w + 2, w  2). the universal

3.3 quantization of the virasoro coadjoint orbits

for a given coadjoint orbit wb0, the hamiltonian function l0(s) generates the s1-action and
can be considered as an energy function of the orbit. b0 is a xed point of this circle action

and corresponds to the classical vacuum. we will discuss about the stability of this vacuum.

write s  ddi s1 in the form s(w) = w +pn sneinw, where sn are complex numbers satisfying
sn = sn. these sn with n 6= 0 provide local coordinates in the neighborhood of b0. s0 acts
trivially on b0 (cf.(3.3)). the behavior of the energy function in the neighborhood of b0 can be

seen by inserting the above s into (3.8) and expanding it with respect to sn. the expansion

turns out [17] to be the form

l0(s) = b0 +xn

n2(b0 +

c
24

n2)|sn|2 + o(s3
n).

(3.26)

the stability of the classical vacuum will be assured by the condition, l0 being bounded from

below at b0. it is achieved only when b0 satises

b0  

c
24

.

(3.27)

all the coadjoint orbits corresponding to the 3-geometries under consideration are satisfying

this stability condition.

the orbit wb0 which satises the condition (3.27) can be quantized. this provides a unitary

irreducible representation of the virasoro algebra. actually it is quantized [18, 19, 17] by the

kahler quantization or geometric quantization method. the coadjoint orbit is topologically
the homogeneous space di s1/h. the little group h is s1 for the black holes, and sl2(r)
6. for these h, the homogeneous space di s1/h becomes a complex manifold. the

for ads3

complex structure turns out [17] to be compatible with the symplectic structure (3.6). thereby

the orbit wb0 which we need, becomes kahler. the complex line bundle on the orbit with its 1st

chern class  provides the unitary irreducible representation on the space of the holomorphic

sections.

to describe the representations it is convenient to shift the virasoro generator l0 to l0 + c
24.

with this shift the algebra (3.7) becomes the standard form

[lm, ln] = (m  n)lm+n +

c
12

(m3  m)m+n,0.

(3.28)

6generators of h can be seen easily by solving f (b0, c) = 0 (3.3) for each cases.

19

any representation of the virasoro algebra with the central charge c can be specied by its
highest weight state |hi. the state |hi, which is called primary, satises l0|hi = h|hi and
ln|hi = 0 for n  1. in addition to these conditions the primary state |0i satises l1|0i = 0.
so it is a sl2(r) invariant state.

unitary representations are the representations in which ln satisfy the condition ln = ln.
the unitary irreducible representations which are obtained by the quantization of the orbits
can be summarized as follows [17] 7: for the orbit of wb0 with b0 > c/24, the corresponding
it is a module
unitary irreducible representation is given by the verma module vh=b0+ c
obtained by successive actions of ln (n  1) on |b0 + c
24i. it has the form

24

.

vb0+ c

24

= mn1n2nk1

cln1ln2    lnk|b0 +

c
24i.

(3.29)

for the orbit wc/24, the corresponding unitary irreducible representation is given by an ana-
logue of the verma module v0. it is obtained by successive actions of ln (n  2) on |0i. we
call this module v0. it has the form

v0 = mn1n2nk2

cln1ln2    lnk|0i.

(3.30)

gathering these results about quantization of the orbits we can prescribe quantization of

the asymptotic virasoro symmetry of the 3-geometries or their virasoro deformations in the

the outer horizon can be identied with the product of the coadjoint orbits w (+)
b0  w ()

the quantizations of the orbits w (+)

ads3.

24i of the representation . for ads3, the deformations of ads+

20

excitations by ln correspond to the virasoro deformation of y(b0,b0) = z0/ . originally
it is the deformation of z0 in sl2(r) which by no means provides any transformation of the
black hole to another one having dierent mass and angular momentum 8. nevertheless, these

degrees of freedom provide the unitary representations of the virasoro algebra. this shows that

these degrees of freedom can be included in the physical spectrum as (massive) gravitons [20].

4 quantization of three-dimensional gravity

as we have seen, quantizations of the virasoro deformations of the btz black holes and ads3
lead the unitary irreducible representations of the virasoro algebra at least when 3l
2g  1. one
may wonder quantization of three-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant

becomes complete by these quantizations. but it does not so. if one takes the chern-simons

gravity viewpoint, these deformations correspond to the local degrees of freedom of the theory
(gravitons), that is, oscillating modes of b and b in the at connection (2.23). to make the
quantization 9 complete, one must take into account of the global degrees of freedom, i.e.,

holonomies. the holonomy variables should be dynamical in the chern-simons gauge theory.

in our context this requires an introduction of their conjugates. given a suitable poisson

structure on the holonomy variables and their quantizations, it is very reasonable to expect

from the perspective of the ads3/cf t2 correspondence that, with an identication of these

quantum operators with the zero modes of an appropriate two-dimensional quantum eld, the

unitary representations obtained in the previous section could be reproduced as the hilbert

space of the two-dimensional conformal eld theory. this expectation turns out to be true at
least when 3l
2g  1. the holonomy variables can be identied with the zero modes of a real

scalar eld x. this scalar eld should be interpreted as the liouville eld in the ultimate.

we start with the description of the poisson structure of the holonomies. then we turn to

construction of the unitary irreducible representations in the framework of the liouville eld

theory or the coulomb gas formalism. finally we make identications between the states of

the three-dimensional gravity and those of the liouville eld theory.

8it is not a reparametrization of z0.
9it would give a quantum gravity in the non-topological phase [4].

21

4.1 holonomy variable

for a given closed path , holonomy of a connection a = (a(+), a()) along the path is given

by

h ()[]  p er

a()

,

(4.1)

where p denotes the path ordering. since we can assume a is at, h[] = (h (+)[], h ()[]) is
invariant up to conjugation under smooth deformations of . in particular trh () are homotopy

invariant. the btz black holes originally admit to have a nontrivial holonomy around a closed
path connecting (w, w, ) and (w + 2, w 2, ) in the constant  surface. let us call this path
1. if there is only one nontrivial holonomy there appears no symplectic structure. in order

to make it a dynamical variable we need to introduce another closed path. let 2 be a path
, ) in the constant  surface. if one regards

, w +r c/6
connecting (w, w, ) and (w +q c/6
it as a closed path and then considers about a holonomy around this path, the quantities 
and  together with r may become dynamical.
in this extended phase space, the btz
black holes themselves will become a lagrangian submanifold  =  = 0. this extension is a

b0

b0

generalization of the o-shell extension of the euclidean black holes examined by carlip and

teitelboim [21].

the at connection which describes x +

(j,m ), the exterior of the outer horizon of the non-
extremal btz black hole, is given by (2.20). the holonomy of this connection around the path

1 can be evaluated as

h (+)[1] = h(+)(w + 2, w  2, )h(+)1

therefore we obtain

(4.4)

(4.5)

to describe the poisson structure of these holonomies in the chern-simons gravity, we

follow the recipe developed by nelson, regge and zertuche [22]. it states that holonomies in a

constant time surface have non-vanishing poisson brackets when the underlying paths intersect

with each other. if one regards the radial coordinate  as a time, the following poisson algebra
of trh ()[i](i = 1, 2) can be obtained :

ntrh ()[1], trh ()[2]o =

a comparison of these weights with that of the in-fock vacuum given in (4.18) makes us adjust

the background charge of the liouville eld to

,

(4.26)

and, accepting this background charge, it also leads an identication of the black hole state

with the following in-fock vacuum :

these are the values allowed by the unitarity condition (4.20). the region (a) in fig.4 cor-
responds to the black holes. all the excitations in the fock space f in

k(j,m )  f

k(j,m )

can be

27

identied with the excitations owing to the virasoro deformation of x +

to gravitons.

to work the above machinery completely, the central charge (2.16) of the virasoro deforma-

therefore these two coincide in this limit. the deviation at nite c is of order 1/c.

the state of ads+

3 has been identied with the primary state |0i|0i. it is invariant under
sl2(r)+  sl2(r). thereby we can identify this state with the sl2(c)-invariant vacuum of
the liouville eld theory :

the sl2(c)-invariant vacuum is the fock vacuum with  = 1 ( = 1) in (4.21) (the origin

are also allowed as far as they satisfy 0 < ,   1. notice that (, ) = (0, 0), that is,
(, ) = (0, 0) in (4.20) corresponds to the state of the massless black hole x +
(0,0). consider a
state |kiin|kiin, where k and k have the form given in (4.21). the weights of this state are
respectively  2l
16g + l
16g . using (4.25) one can read mass and angular momentum
as m =  2+2
16g . therefore the corresponding 3-geometry is conic [23]. this
means that the state |kiin  |kiin is that of a conical singularity. the region (b) in fig.4
corresponds to the conical singularities. rather surprisingly, its virasoro deformation gives

16g and  2l
16g and j =  (22)l

16g + l

rise to the unitary representation. this might imply that conical singularities with the allowed

mass and momentum get mild quantum mechanically. our understanding of singularities in

classical relativity may be required to change in quantum theory.

the values of b0 and b0 which correspond to k and k are  2l

conical singularity. in particular, when  = , the appearance of the conical singularity is due
to a particle with mass 1

4.3.2 how can we understand 3d black holes in two dimensions ?

having obtained the correspondence between the states of the three-dimensional quantum grav-

ity and the two-dimensional conformal eld theory, one may ask how the three-dimensional

black holes can be understood in two dimensions where the conformal eld lives.

to investigate this question, it is useful to discuss rst the case of the conical sigularities.
the state |kiin  |kiin of the conical singularity can be obtained by an operation of the

where x(z, z) = x(z) + x(z) and fx(z, z)  x(z)  x(z) 14. if one takes the path-integral

figure 7: the conical singularity seen by the boundary liouville eld x

the liouville eld x treats the conical singularity as an insertion of the corresponding vertex

operator. this vertex operator has the following origin in three-dimensions. to explain this, we

rst remark that the p1 where the liouville eld theory lives can be regarded as that obtained

by a compactication of the boundary cylinder at innity. this compactication also makes

the solid cylinder to a three-dimensional ball. in such a compactication to a three-ball, the

conical sigularity located at the center must intersect with the p1 precisely at the two points,
0 and . see fig.7. now, back to the path-integral expression given in (4.35), we can say
that these intersections of the conical singularity with the boundary sphere are realized as the

vertex operators in the boundary liouville eld theory. in particular, the gravitational state
of a particle with mass 1

4g sitting at the center of ads3 can be treated by an insertion of the

corresponding vertex operator.

nextly let us discuss about the case of the black holes. basically we follow the same argument

as above. the black hole state (4.27) can be obtained by an operation of the corresponding

vertex operator on the sl2(c)-invariant vacuum,

|j, miin = lim

the following manner :

(4.37)

31

this path-integral representation also provides some idea about our interpretation of the black

holes in the two dimensions.

we rst remark that the outer horizon of the black hole can not be recognized as a two-

dimensional object under the virasoro deformation. see fig.3 for the non-extremal case. it is

treated as a one-dimensional object for the massive black hole, and as a point for the massless

black hole. the virasoro deformation is originally introduced as a deformation of the non-

compact simply-connected region z0. this region of sl2(r) is the covering space of the

exterior of the outer horizon of the black hole. under the virasoro deformation what one can

recognize as the outer horizon is the counterpart of the outer horizon on sl2(r). it is obtained

by the completion of z0 at  = 0. we can easily see that these completions for the cases of the

massive extremal and massless black holes are respectively given by adding one-dimensional

and zero-dimensional objects. being zero-dimensional in the massless case may be understood

as a degeneration from the massive case.

we hope to explain the geometrical origin of the insertion of the vertex operator in (4.37).

let us examine rst the compactication of the boundary cylinder of the black hole x +
to the p1. t =  circles of the boundary cylinder are mapped to the two points 0 and 
of the p1. this compactication of the boundary also provide a compactication of the bulk
geometry. now we will ask what it gives rise to. we can assume reasonably that t =  slices
of x +
(j,m ) are compactied to 0 and  of the p1. if one accepts this assumption, the outer
horizon must be compactied to 0 and  of p1. this is because the t =  slices of x +
(j,m )
include the outer horizon after the completion. see fig.3. this shows that the intersections of

(j,m )

the black hole with the boundary sphere are realized by the vertex operators as described in

(4.37). see fig.8.

5 towards conformal field theory on the horizon

to provide a microscopic description of black holes in quantum gravity or string theory is a

very impressive and enlightening issue. for the three-dimensional black holes such a microscopic

description has been proposed by carlip [8] and strominger [9, 10]. it states that microscopic

states of the black holes are the states of a conformal eld theory on the horizon. although

at present we do not know exactly what conformal elds do live on the horizon, their proposal

32

0

figure 8: the black hole seen by the boundary liouville eld x

makes it possible to give statistical mechanical explanations of the thermodynamical properties

of the black hole.

receiving their proposal, many questions will arise. first of all, can one identify the bound-

ary liouville eld theory with a conformal eld theory on the horizon ? our answer is no.

as explained at the end of the last section, the virasoro deformation of the exterior of the

outer horizon can not recognize the horizon as a two-dimensional object. it can recognize the

horizon only as a one-dimensional object. this means that the virasoro algebra obtained from

the deformation cannot be the virasoro algebra on the horizon. on the other hand, this defor-

mation provides the asymptotic virasoro algebra, which generators are gravitons in bulk and

are identied with the excitations of the boundary liouville eld. this eld theory has the

continuous spectrums. therefore these two conformal eld theories are by no means equivalent

to each other.

if one accepts this answer, one might be led to another question : what conformal eld

theory is living on the horizon ? to this question we can not answer denitely. here we would

like to propose two possible descriptions of this conformal eld theory. the rst one is based

on a simple hypothesis : the virasoro algebra of the horizon conformal eld theory should

generate the virasoro deformation of the horizon. to work this hypothesis, we need, rst

of all, to treat the outer horizon as a two-dimensional object. if one takes the chern-simons

gravity viewpoint, it is doubtful whether one can handle the outer horizon as a two-dimensional

object. to be successful, presumably one needs the string theory viewpoint. namely, if the two-

dimensional horizon is identied with a macroscopic string in sl2(r), the horizon conformal

33

eld theory would be string theory on this background. it describes quantum uctuations of

the macroscopic string and will lead the microscopic description of the black holes. but it is

not clear, at least for us, to what extent this string theory is analyzable.

the second possible description of the horizon conformal eld theory is based on the hypoth-

esis : the virasoro deformation of the region between the inner and outer horizons should lead

the virasoro algebra on the horizon conformal eld theory. this hypothesis can be regarded

as an analogue which we used in the construction of the boundary liouville eld theory. in

particular it may allow us to follow the similar step as we took for the study of the exterior of

the outer horizon.

to be explicit, let us consider the region between the inner and outer horizons of the non-
15. a covering space of x(j,m ) is given

extremal btz black hole x(j,m ). we will call it x(j,m )
by a non-compact simply-connected region of sl2(r) consisting of the group elements

because the allowed ranges of the coordinates are dierent from each other. (for a0 (2.20) the

a deformation of z1 could be constructed in such a manner that it is related with the virasoro

deformation of z0 by an appropriate gauge transformation. thus obtained deformation will
dene the virasoro deformation of z1 and thereby that of x(j,m ), the region between the inner
and outer horizons of the black hole. the corresponding conformal eld theory will be regarded

as the horizon conformal eld theory.

the second description of the horizon conformal eld theory may provide another inter-

pretation of the surprising conjecture made by maldacena [1], which may be understood in

our situation as a correspondence between the boundary and horizon conformal eld theories

under a suitable renormalization group ow. the second description, if it is correct, implies a

possibility of a realization of this correspondence in terms of gauge transformation.

we thank s. mano for useful discussions.
