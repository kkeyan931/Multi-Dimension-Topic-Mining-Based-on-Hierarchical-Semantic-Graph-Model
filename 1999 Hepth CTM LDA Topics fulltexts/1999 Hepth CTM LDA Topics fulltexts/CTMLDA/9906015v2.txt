abstract

in a nonrelativistic contact four-fermion model we show, that simple -cut-o prescrip-
tions together with a denite ne-tuning of the  dependence of bare quantities give the
exact solutions for two-particle sector and goldstone modes. their correspondence with
the self-adjoint extension into pontryagin space is established leading to self-adjoint semi-
bounded hamiltonians in three-particle sectors as well. renormalized faddeev equations for
the bound states with fredholm properties are obtained and analysed.

introduction

models with four-fermion interaction arise in a wide range of problems both in quantum eld
theory and condensed matter physics [1]. contact four-fermion interaction models shed a light
on the low-energy hadronization regime of qcd where the perturbative approach fails. they
are used as qualitative and quantitative descriptions of various phenomenological data in hadron
physics. the non-perturbative nature of the bound states in both hadron and condensed matter
physics challenges numerous eorts to develop in quantum eld theory the non-perturbative
methods which particularly aim at an explicit non-perturbative solution of the corresponding
theoretical model [2].

the success of four-fermion models originates, rstly, from the fact, that these models em-
body chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking [3]. it is well known, however, that such
models are nonrenormalizable within the conventional perturbation theory. calculations around
four-fermion models face ultraviolet divergencies. these divergencies are treated, as a rule, by
introducing an ultraviolet cut-o  indicating the range of validity of the model. the math-
ematical reason of the divergencies partially becomes apparent in the framework of extension
theory. the very singular interactions in such models can not be considered as a correct quan-
tum mechanical potential. therefore, every n particle fock state has to be studied within the
extension theory prescriptions.
the non-relativistic contact four-fermion models are particularly interesting, because in these
frameworks they possess a family of the exact analytical three-dimensional solutions in one- and

two-particle sectors. these solutions, for example, can be considered as a basis to study the
mechanism of bosonization and condensation in hartree-fock approximation.

it should be stressed, that a vector current-current contact term leads to a generalized
point two-particle interaction which, in the modern extension theory, appears simultaneously
as a local and separable nite rank perturbation containing a nite set of arbitrary extension
parameters with clear physical meaning. thus, in contrast to some popular belief, the contact
eld interaction promises to become physically even more rich and predictive than the usual
(non-local) separable one.

the non-relativistic limit of the contact four-fermion model was developed in our previous
articles [4], [5], [6]. there was demonstrated, that such contact quantum eld models possess
exact two-particle solutions. we claried the mathematical origin of the model divergencies
and gave a simple prescription how to treat them nonperturbatively. to this end a functional
dependence of all model bare quantities on a cut-o  was assumed. next, this functional
dependence was determined by means of the limiting procedure relating the nite observables and
innite bare quantities at    in one-particle and two-particle fock states. in the present
paper the investigation of our model is continued, to include the three-particle sector as well.
it will be elucidated, how the vacuum, one-particle, and two-particle renormalized fock states
completely dene the three-particle ones, demonstrating self-consistency of our renormalization
prescription, whose mathematical basis is provided by the extension theory.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 the operator diagonalization of the initial
hamiltonian is described. in section 3 and appendix a the underlying singular two-particle
problem is reviewed. sections 4, 5 and 6 contain our main analysis of three-particle equations
with some details placed in appendix b. one can trace the long history of the development of
singular two- and three-particle problems in the recent articles [7] (and references therein). we
would like to notice here, that our consideration follows the idea of [8], [9] and especially [10],
but we use another possibility to regularize the instantaneous (anti) commutation relations with
the same regularization as for the interaction.

it is easy to show, that for this a system the symmetries sut (2) and u (1) turn out to be
spontaneously broken and there are four composite goldstone states associating with spin-ip

here jn() and dp () are dened in appendix a by eq. (76) and (83). the galileo invariance
of this solution is restored only due to the limit    in the same manner as for the goldstone
states above. we notice from (7), (29), (32), that there is no direct relation between the character
of the point interaction and the sign of the quartic contact self-interaction in (1). one can always
choose for a given g() the -dependence of bare parameters m(), e0() (32) to leave the
m(), e0() nite at   . whereas the g() is determining by the two-particle eigenvalue

as a dimension transmutation condition [8], [9] transforming the bare coupling constants 0,
0 (23) and the cut-o  into unknown binding and scattering dimensional parameters b and
 [6].
in this way, these real quantities become an arbitrary parameters of the self-adjoint
extension and certain of them are expressed through the coecients of formal -series (34) of
bare quantities (32) by the ne-tuning relations (36). within these relations the nite one-
particle spectra for qq-channels take the following forms: (four positions of the l.h.s. are in

as 1{}  0 (33), a non zero solution, similar to (25), (26), (28), (29) (without restriction
(31)), appears only if one discriminates the terms of subsequent order of formally the same
divergences < k2 > (7) and < [k2] > (76). these divergences originate from regularizations of
the anticommutator (3), (4) in one-particle spectrum and two-particle interaction kernel (14)
respectively. their dierence reecting their dierent physical nature may be easily treated as
a xed shift of the cut-o    + /3, manifesting itself in < [k2] > < k2 > + and in
(36). however, such a shift breaks down the above goldstone solution (21) at any nite  even
for p = 0. thus, the existence of the bound (and scattering) states in the a a-channel and in
the aa( a a)-channel, as well as the goldstone mode implies the mutually exclusive conditions
of ne tuning (35), (36), (37), (38). thats why in appendix a we trace the further fate of
goldstone states and the derivation of the solution (29) in the framework of extension theory by
means of the procedure which, in certain sense, is equivalent to the divergence manipulations of
such kind.

really, a simple normalization test for the scattering solution (28), (29) shows the necessity
of at least one additional discrete q-depended component for the wave function, with a positive
or negative metric contribution according to the sign of . so, strictly speaking, we deal with
a self-adjoint extension of the initial free hamiltonian which is restricted on the appropriate
subspace of l2, onto extended hilbert (or pontryagin) space l2  c 1, (l2  c 1) [12], [13].
however, this additional discrete component of the eigenfunctions only corrects their scalar
product.
it is completely dening by the same parameters of the self-adjoint extension but
does not aects the physical meaning of obtained solution in ordinary space [11]-[15]. besides

7

(see appendix a), it would be inappropriate to associate this additional components with the
additional set of creation-annihilation operators [12].

another extension appears for the choice of nite bare mass, that is true only for the
b-system and for (a)-case of the a-system. thus g0,1 = 0,1 = 0, and (32), (33), together
with the condition (83), lead to the solution, coinciding with the well known extension in l2
[8] of the singular operator from (24) with 0  0, for which: ()

the kernel (44) obviously reproduces all permutation symmetries and a momentum conserva-
tion. therefore, it seems convenient to simplify the separation of the spin-symmetry structure
from the coordinate wave function for p 6= 0 by the using of the formal functions of three
dependent variables, like d(p,j,m)
(~q1~q2~q3) (42), introducing suitable formfactors (further

one can easily recognize for nite  the interiors of square brackets in the kernels of that
equations to be the exact o-shell extensions (80) of the corresponding half-o-shell two-particle
t-matrices from the l.h.s. of (29), (30). however, the renormalized version of these o-shell
t-matrices obviously coincide with the respective on-shell ones, given by r.h.s. of (29), (30) (see
appendix a). so, one observes, when   , the restoration of the galileo invariance, as in two-
particle case [6], and comes to further simplications ~cx,y,z = bx,y = 0. they yield to the one

s-wave kernel of the rst of the equations (68), (69) at   , however, for the rst of eq.(67),
as well as for all p-wave kernels above and here, the limit is zero under these conditions. so,
~c1,2,3(~q) = q1(~q; ~p) = 0, and eq. (68), (69) degenerate into the system for the functions of
only one variable q2,3(~q; 2~r)) = a2,3(~q). that means a3(~q) = a2(~q)  a(~q), returning
(61) for a(~q)  a(~q) with  = 1. this equation up to
us virtually to the previous eq.

a multiplicative constant /2 coincides with the shondins equation [12]. as it was shown in
[12], [7], the asymptotic behavior (62) provides, that we deal with a self-adjoint semi-bounded
below three-particle hamiltonian in the both cases. however, the hamiltonians related to more
slowly vanishing t-matrix for other two-particle extensions (40) are unbounded, manifesting the
collapse in three-particle system under consideration.

the absence of any vector parameters for p = 0 implies, that a(~q)  a(q) for zero total

a simple analysis, carried out in appendix b, shows, that for the appropriate conditions the
integral operator written here is equivalent to the symmetrical quite continuous and positively

for positive . we conclude in the case  = 1, that the bound states of three identical
fermi-particles of any type a, a, b, c can not appear in this model for such self-adjoint semi-
bounded extension. at the same time, the case  = 1 describes the bound states of aaa

6 conclusions

let us resume the main points of our considerations. we pick out among the various eld
operator realizations of singular hamiltonian (1) with rich internal symmetry the only realization
with spontaneous symmetry breaking. then, we reveal the denite -dependence of bare
mass and coupling constant keeping the galileo invariance of the corresponding simple exact
goldstone solutions. this dependence, in turn, together with a natural subtraction procedure,
xes the self-adjoint extensions of the hamiltonian in one- and two-particle sectors; this latter
determines the well-dened three-particle hamiltonian.

so, in ref. [6] and here we have formulated unambiguous renormalization procedure extract-
ing a renormalized dynamics from nonrenormalizable contact four-fermion interaction. this
procedure is self-consistent in every n -particle sector, it is closely connected with the construc-
tion of the self-adjoint extension of the corresponding quantum mechanical hamiltonians and
with the restoration of galileo invariance.

it has been shown, that the simple -cut-o and natural subtraction prescriptions with
the denite  dependencies of bare quantities, xed by ne-tuning relations, reduce the eld
hamiltonian (1) into the family of self-adjoint semi-bounded hamiltonians in one-, two-, and
three-particle sectors with above exact solutions, correctly dened for scattering and bound
states, as well as for goldstone mode, containing a nite set of arbitrary extension parameters

m0, e()

a0 , b,  with clear physical meaning for all two-particle channels of a,b,c-systems.

thus, the developed renormalization procedure may be considered as a direct generalization
onto strongly singular point interactions of the berezin-faddeev procedure [8], [16]. from the

13

point of view of quantum eld theory it gives an example of a nonperturbative renormalization
for the four-fermion interaction. it is interesting to note, that the initial two-particle operator
(24) here is the same as the operator of diejen and tip [15], at the same time, the shondins [12]
and fewsters [13] hamiltonians may be considered as the various possible renormalized ones.

the following conclusions are in order. the renormalization procedure with -cut-o pre-
scription and ne-tuning relations on the one hand, and extension theory on the other hand
maintain the same s-wave two-particle solution (29), (62) from the various points, supplement-
ing each other. nevertheless, the additional physical conditions are necessary to make a choice
among the various mathematical possibilities. e.g., to have three-particle bound state, it is nec-
essary to consider aaa-channel with two-particle bound state in aa-channel only, i.e. the case
0 = 3/5. it is worth to note, that identifying a, a as a constituent light quark, antiquark
and considering m0 as thier constituent mass  330 mev, one nds from (21) for goldstone
mass mg = (2/5)m0 = 132 mev, that is very close to the pion mass m. at the same time,
it is sucient two parameters b and  to reproduce the masses of the corresponding -meson
and nucleon as the two- and three-particle bound states with the wave functions (29), (72)
respectively.

belyaev and w.sandhas for useful remarks, and the referees of few-body systems for careful
reading of manuscript.

appendix a: goldstone mode against extension theory.

here it is shown how extension theory maintains the solution (29). according to the general
shondins construction [14] developed for our case in [15], self-adjoint extensions of any operator
of type (24) are generating as extensions of laplace operator h0 = 2
x from the subspace
of h0 = l2 hj|i = 0 xed by functionals h~k|ji = j(~k)  hj, 1(~k) = 1, 2(~k) = ~k2
into pontryagin space of type h0  c 1  c 1 with forthcoming narrowing onto positively dened
subspace. the resolvents of all such self-adjoint extensions are containing in the closure (in
pontryagin space) of kreins formula for the resolvent associated with our rank 2 perturbation
(for s-wave):

so, besides r0(z), only this term remains for  = 0 with nite b2

after subtraction dp
{}(b) with the condition (83) and the ne-tuning
relations (36), the limit    for (80), as well as for the t-matrix t(z) (81), certainly, leads to
solution (29), (62), while (z), (cid:0)1(z)(cid:1)22 vanish. however, (33) entails for the case {}, that
(z)  0 already for nite , leaving the resolvent (78) in diagonal form with the last term:
 h~x|1i(cid:16)1(z)(cid:17)22 h1|~yi = v  3(~x)3(~y)
{} =   2  p 2. (84)
g(p) according to (33), (36),
(38), and the generalized solution (21) v  h~x|1i = v  3(~x) is still exact wave function of
the goldstone states (18) for p = 0 at nite m,  as well. however, its contribution (84) into
the resolvent disappears with    for arbitrary . thus, for  6= 0, the described procedure
gives in fact the limit of t(z) (81) only, like the procedure in ref. [12].
the kreins formula for a resolvent of an extended operator is essentially the second identity
(74), where, by denition, the arbitrary nite constant hermitian matrix l1 has nothing to
do with the bare matrix l1
(75). the above subtraction procedure for denominator (80)
will be evidently reproduced by the relations l1 = 0,  = b2 < 0 for (z, ). to make it
meaningful, as the rst step, the pre-pontryagin space is constructed by adding to h0-subspace
the generalized defect elements |(n)
i = (r0())jn |ji  hn, j  1  n  0, where
. . .  h1  h0  h1  . . . is subscale [15] of usual sobolev scale [16]; as the next step, the
i|(n)
prescription for their scalar products is introduced h(m)
which for divergent
cases m + n > 0 are equated to elements of arbitrary hermitian matrix. our denition of them

so, this matrix of derivatives is negatively dened in accordance with the conditions derived
in [14]. the generalized defect space here is spanned by the kets |(0)
i. they are
combining into the |1i = |(1)
1 i regenerating the goldstone degree of freedom
for the scattering eigenstate which ensues from (78), (79). however, this defect element can
not become an eigenvector of extended hamiltonian, because now the (z, ) 6= 0. this is
the price of the possibility to normalize the smoothed scattering eigenstate in the (positive)
norm topology of the pontryagin space obtained by completion of suitable pre-pontryagin space
[14] spanned in turn by the kets [15] |i = |i + c0|(0)
i with c0, c1  c 1,
  h1. the simplied extension space of sec.3 and [12], [13] h0  c 1 (h0  c 1) arises here
under additional condition (~x = 0) = 0 [6]. thus, the function h~x|1i = 3(~x) is playing a
dual role: as a generalized goldstone state eigenfunction in -cut-o approach, or as a total
defect component of scattering (and bound) eigenstates in extended space of extension theory.
the point is that goldstone state, considering as a bound state with zero binding energy at
zero orbital momentum, is forbidden as usual square-integrable solution of quantum mechanical
schrodinger equation with a short range potential. thats why this purely quantum eld degree
of freedom disguises as the additional discrete dimension of extended space.

d w (cosh  ) ( ) ln(cid:18) 2 cosh(  ) + 1
2 cosh(  )  1(cid:19) ;

cosh  t ( cosh  ) .

(88)

here w (cosh  ) is even function of  and  is a suitable positive constant introduced for conve-
nience. note, that the last kernel has additional eigenfunctions with opposite (even) parity.

according to general restrictions from the two- and three-particle scattering problems [17]
we suppose  > 0,  > b  0. therefore, from (62) t ((q)) > 0 tends to zero fast enough to
make meaningful the next substitution:

( ) = ( ) =

this is obviously true for arbitrary t ((q)) with the above properties and transforms (88) into
the equation with symmetrical quite continuous kernel:

at last, the simple explicit expressions follow for both  () and ( ) from (89) at b = 0,

e () =

e( ) =

and similarly for (), (). this allows direct application of faddeevs consideration [17] to eq.

numerical solution of eq.(90) shows this asymptotic behavior in fact starts from the ground
state m = 1 for interesting odd solutions fm(), corresponding to integer m > 0. to be more
exact, for m = 1, 2, 3, 4, one has m  (m + )/0, where   0.060.
