we apply the dmrg method to the 2 dimensional delta function poten-

tial which is a simple quantum mechanical model with asymptotic freedom

and formation of bound states. the system block and the environment block

of the dmrg contain the low energy and high energy degrees of freedom,

respectively. the ground state energy and the lowest excited states are ob-

tained with an unprecedent accuracy. we compare the dmrg method with

the similarity rg method and propose its generalization to eld theoretical

models in high energy physics.

]a hallmark of an asymptotically free theory such as qcd is that it contains many
degrees of freedom, with very dierent energy scales, which are coupled by the interaction

hamiltonian. perturbative methods are valid for short distance physics but they fail for

small momentum transfers or for energy scales where the bound states are formed. the

existence of multiple energy scales suggests that the renormalization group approach is

the correct strategy to attack these non perturbative problems. in recent years there has

been several proposals to extract eective low energy hamiltonians using rg methods.

of particular interest is the light-front hamiltonian approach advocated in references [1,2]

which uses a similarity rg method (srg) [3,4]. in this method the rg ow is given by an

unitary transformation which diagonalizes the hamiltonian by succesive elimination of the

o-diagonal matrix elements. the srg-cuto can be seen as the width of the band which

1

contains the non vanishing o-diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian. at the end of

the srg ow the width is zero and the corresponding hamiltonian contains it its diagonal

all the eigenvalues of the original one.

in this letter we shall propose an alternative rg approach to study asymptotically free

models using the density matrix renormalization group (dmrg). we shall also show the

relations and dierences between the dmrg and the srg methods. the dmrg was pro-

posed by white in 1992 to solve the problems of the old real space rg methods encountered

in the 70s, which led in those days to their abandon in favour of montecarlo techniques

[5]. the dmrg has by now become a standard numerical rg method applied to many

body problems in condensed matter and other branches of physics ( see references [6,7]

for reviews). it is thus challenging to test how the dmrg handles the subtle dynamics of

asymptotically free theories. to our knowledge this is the rst paper devoted to the subject.

for this reason we have choosen as a theoretical lab a simple model possesing the essen-

tial properties of asymptotic freedom and formation of bound states, which are shared by

realistic theories like qcd.

the natural candidate for such a simple model is provided by a 2d quantum mechanical

particle subject to a delta function potential [8]. the solution of the 2d delta function

schrodinger equation requires a regularization and renormalization schemes as in an ordinary

quantum eld theory. we shall use for our purposes the lattice regularization introduced

by glazek and wilson in their srg study of the problem [9,10]. these authors formulated

the problem in momentum space where the states are labelled by an integer n that ranges

between an infrared cuto m and an ultraviolet cuto n (i.e. m  n  n). the kinetic
energy en of the state n increases exponentially as en = b2n, where b is an arbitrary constant
greater than one. for numerical computations we shall take the value b = 2 as in references
[9,10]. the interaction hamiltonian between the states n and m is given by genem,

where g is the coupling constant of the problem. the discrete lattice hamiltonian h is

dened by the matrix elements

2

hnm = n,mb2n  g bn+m, m  n, m  n

(1)

an overall shift of the levels by a constant term, i.e. n  n + n0, implies that hnm scales
with the factor b2n0. this is a discrete version of scale invariance, which is broken by the

infrared and ultraviolets cutos m and n. the latter symmetry implies that all the scales

contribute to the observables. as an illustration of this fact let us calculate the energy of the

trial wave function (n) = cbm n, which yields a good approximation to the exact ground

state (gs) for large values of n (c is a normalization constant). a simple computation yields

[9]

hhi = c2b2m [(n  m + 1)  g(n  m + 1)2]

(2)

this result means that all the scales contribute on equal footing to the gs energy, which

makes very hard an accurate determination of its value by methods other than the exact

one. the srg applied to the case m = 21, n = 16 and g = 0.06 [9,10] yields a gs
energy with a error of 10%, which in any case is a remarkable result taken into account the

10 orders of magnitude between the infrared and ultraviolet cutos. for the latter choice

of parameters the hamiltonian (1) has one bound state with energy equal to 1 and 37
scattering states with positive energy.

the rst step in the dmrg method is the partition of the system in two pieces called the

system block and the environment block [5]. the correct choice of these blocks is dictated

by the physics of the problem. in our case we shall choose the system block bl

 to be given

by the low energy levels n which lie between the infrared cuto m and the scale  (i.e.

m  n  ), while the environment block bh
the ultraviolet cuto n and the scale  (i.e.   n  n). the whole system, with energy
levels ranging from m to n, is obtained as the superblock bl
+3, where  and  are

 will contain the high energy levels n between

  bh

the n =  + 1 and n =  + 2 energy levels respectively (see g.1).

the parameter  varies from m to n  3 and it labels the dmrg ow. let us supose
we want to nd the gs of the whole system. we shall choose a trial gs wave function (n)

as follows,

(n) =

where l ( resp. r+3) is a normalized vector which describes the contribution of the low

( resp. high) energy block bl

 ( resp. bh

+3) to the gs of the superblock bl

  bh

+3. the

ansatz (3) is the momentum space version of the real space dmrg applied by white to

study a free particle in a box [6,7]. our approach is close in spirit to the momentum space

dmrg method proposed by xiang [11]. the energy of the state (3) can be conveniently

written as

h|h|i = ha|hsb()|ai

(4)

where |ai is the vector (a1, a2, a3, a4) and the superblock hamiltonian hsb() is the 4  4
matrix given by

hsb() =





hl hl hl hlh

hl h h hh

hl h h hh

hlh hh hh hh





(5)

whose entries read

hl = hl|h|li,
h = h+1,+1,
hl = p
hh = pn
hh = pn

hh = hr+3|h|r+3i
h = h+2,+2
hl = p

n=m hn,+2l(n)

(6)

n=m hn,+1l(n),

n=+3 hn,+1r+3(n), hlh = hl|h|r+3i
n=+3 hn,+2r+3(n) h = h+2,+3

where hn,m are the matrix elements given in eq. (1). notice that eq.(4) takes the form of an

eigenvalue problem in a reduced vector space with only 4 degrees of freedom. the gs of the

superblock can be found by looking for the lowest eigenvalue e1() of the 4 4 matrix hsb.
the variational nature of the construction gives an upper bound of the exact gs energy. if

the vectors l and r+3 coincide with the low energy and high energy pieces of the exact gs

wave function then the dmrg algorithm presented so far would reproduce the exact result.

of course this is not in general the case but nevertheless, one can actually use the dmrg

algorithm to improve in succesive steps the gs energy. the idea is to apply a continuity

argument. suppose we shift the scale  to the next high energy level, say  + 1. then the

new low energy vector l

+1 will be related to the previous one l by the equation

the data l

as the renormalization of the block bl

 . the next step is to construct the superblock

and so on. this procedure is iterated until the scale  = n  3, where one reverses the

+2

5

dmrg steps in order to update the high energy blocks bh

 using the low energy blocks

built in the previous steps. after a few sweeps from low to high energy and viceversa the

lowest eigenvalue of the superblock hamiltonian (5) converges to a x value which gives the

dmrg estimation of the gs energy. to start out the process one has to grow up the system

to its actual size. this can be done by considering superblocks of the form bl

m +p  bh

n p

where p = 0, . . . , (n  m  3)/2. the last value of p yields a system containing all the
scales from m to n. the low and high energy blocks constructed in the warm up are

the starting point for the sweeping procedure explained above (see [6,7] for details). the

previous algorithm has been generalized in reference [12] to nd out not only the gs but

the low lying excitations as well.

let us now present our dmrg results for the case considered in references [9,10], where

m = 21, n = 16 and g = 0.06060600032108866. the latter value of g is choosen in
such a way that the exact ground state energy of (1) is given exactly by 1. the dmrg
algorithm presented above gives the exact ground state energy with an error of 1014 (see

table 1). for simple quantum mechanical problems, like a particle in a box or a potential,

the dmrg gives gs energies with this order of precision [6,12].

in the latter examples

the discrete hamiltonians are tridiagonal matrices whose entries vary smoothly through the

lattice. these feautures are not shared by the hamiltonian (1) which indeed varies quite

abruptly from entry to entry while having all entries non vanishing. using the extension of

the dmrg proposed in [12] we have also computed the gs and the lowest 3 excited states

of the hamiltonian (1). in table 1 we compare our dmrg results with the exact ones in

terms of the relative deviation

as shown in table 1 the accuracy of the excited states energies is lower than that of the

gs. this feauture is peculiar to the delta function hamiltonian and it does not arise for the

quantum mechanical models studied in [12]. there are several reasons for the unprecedent

accuracy of the dmrg applied to the hamiltonian (1). recall that the srg method gives

the gs energy with a 10% error [9,10]. first of all the dmrg gives a variational upper bound

to the exact gs energy which is usually improved in every dmrg step. secondly all the

matrix elements of the whole hamiltonian are used many times to feedback the superblock

so that no information is lost. finally, the dmrg method focus on the determination of

the gs and the low lying states, while the srg method considers all the eigenstates.

moreover the dmrg oers the possibility to reconstruct the actual shape of the gs

wave function.

in g.2 we plot the wave function in the warm up, which is rather bad,

together with the one obtained after the rst sweep, which converges to the exact shape.

after the third sweep the dmrg wave function is indistinguishable from the exact one. all

these results show that the dmrg gives in fact the exact bound state of the discrete delta

function potential within the machine precision.

it is interesting to investigate the nature of the dmrg ow as compared with the one of

7

the similarity rg method. in the srg the eective hamiltonian h(s) evolves as a function

of s according to the wegner equation [4],

dh(s)

ds

= [[hd(s), h(s)], h(s)]

(10)

where hd(s) is the diagonal part of h(s). the initial condition of eq.(10) is h(0) = h,

where h is the original hamiltonian of the problem. the parameter s ranges from 0 to 
and it can be identied with the inverse square of the energy width , i.e. s = 1/2. eq.

(10) implies that h(s) is related to h by an unitary transformation and therefore they share

their eigenvalues. when s increases, the o diagonal matrix elements of h(s), located at

distances greater than the width  = 1/s, become very small. when s =  the eective
hamiltonian h() is diagonal and all its entries coincide with the eigenvalues of h. the
numerical integration of eq.(10) requires of course to follow the evolution of all the entries

of h. one would like instead to project the eective hamiltonians to smaller matrices in

order to reproduce the bound state eigenvalue. this idea has indeed been pursued in [10]

with results within an accuracy of order 10 to 20%. the dmrg method gives a solution

to this problem yielding the exact bound state energy. hence we may wonder if the dmrg

gives an exact realization of the srg ideas. to this end we have studied the rg ow of the

eigenvalues ei()(i = 1, . . . , 4) of the superblock hamiltonian (5). in g.3 we plot the lowest

eigenvalue e1, together with the remaining ones scaled down by a factor b2. we can clearly

see from g.3 that e1 stays constant through all the dmrg steps while ei(i = 2, 3, 4) vary

with the energy scale b2 with some deviations depending on the energy region. the plateaus

correspond to low energy regions while the oscillations and bumps occur for intermediate

and high energies. to a rst order approximation, which is almost exact for the plateaus,

the superblock hamiltonian (5) can be written as

e1

where o is a unitary matrix. using eq.(11) one can show that the superblock hamiltonians

satisfy the following second order recursion relation,

hsb() =

1

b+b1 (cid:16)b1uhsb( + 1)u 

 + bu 

1hsb(  1)u1(cid:17)

where u = oo

h1 

dhsb
d  [, hsb],

dh1
d

= [, h1]

(12)

(13)

where  = do

d o

. eq.(13) is a second order diferential equation which is to be compared

with the rst order equation eq.(10). the dmrg ow is a sort of similarity transformation

with some eigenvalues running with the scale. using the standard rg terminology the

lowest eigenvalue e1 can be associated with a marginal operator while the eigenvalues ei for

i = 2, 3, 4 are associated with infrared irrelevant operators which vanish at the xed point

hamiltonian hsb( = m). indeed all the entries of hsb( = m) are very small except for

the entry hh = 0.999 whose value is close to the bound state energy. these results suggest
that the exactness of the dmrg method is due to a careful treatment of the irrelevants

operators, which in other rg methods are dicult to control in general.

from a conceptual point of view the dmrg oers a new way of thinking about cut-

os and rg ows in high energy physics. traditional cutos remove high energy states

while the lowering of the cuto produces eective operators for lower energies [13]. in the

lagrangian formulation this strategy can be implemented perturbatively without much di-

culty. however in the hamiltonian formulation it gives rise to small denominators problems

involving energy dierences between the states kept and the states truncated in the rg

process [14,9]. this latter problems do not arise in the dmrg truncation for it uses a non

perturbative self-consistent algorithm to nd the best choice of the eective hilbert spaces

and hamiltonians.

the next step in the application of the dmrg to high energy physics is of course to

consider eld theoretical models with asymptotic freedom and bound states. the main ideas

presented in this letter can in principle be generalized to this type of models.

is very encouraging.
