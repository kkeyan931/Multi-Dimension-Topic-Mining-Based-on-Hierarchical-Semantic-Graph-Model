abstract

we study the proposed duality between the 5-dimensional supergravity/superstiring
on ads3s2 and the 2-dimensional n = (0, 4) scft dened on the boundary of ads-
space. we construct explicitely the n = (0, 4) scft by imposing the quiver projec-

tion developed by douglas-moore [12] on the n = (4, 4) scft of symmetric orbifold,

which is proposed to be the dual of the 6-dimensional supergravity/superstiring on
ads3  s3.

we explore in detail the spectrum of chiral primaries in this quiver scf t2. we
compare it with the kaluza-klein spectrum on ads3  s2 and check the consistency
between them. we further emphasize that orbifolding of bulk theory should not corre-

spond to orbifolding of the boundary cft in the usual sense of two dimensional cft,

rather corresponds to the quiver projection. we observe that these are not actually

equivalent with each other when we focus on the multi-particle states.

1 introduction

ads3/cf t2-duality has been understood most sucessfully among the several proposals

of adsd+1/cf td-duality [1, 2, 3] in general dimensions. this is due to the fact that the

two dimensional conformal symmetry is very powerful to analyze the spectrum, and three

dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological term can be quantized by recasting it to

chern-simons theory [4, 5]. among other things, one of the most remarkable success is the

complete agreement between the bps kaluza-klein (kk) spectrum of supergravity theory
(sugra) on ads3  s3  m 4 (with m 4 = t 4 or k3) and the spectrum of chiral primary
states of n = (4, 4) scf t2 with the target manifold symn (m 4) [6, 7]. however, analyses on

the models with less supersymmetries are still far from complete. in this paper we shall focus
on the correspondence between the 5-dimensional sugra on ads3  s2 and the n = (0, 4)
scf t2 dened on the boundary of ads3.

the most general examples which realize this geometry in the near horizon limit are
given by considering the m-theoty compactied on some calabi-yau 3-fold m 6 (including
the cases m 6 = t 6, t 2  k3) [1, 8, 9], and we can construct the boundary n = (0, 4)
scf t2 by making m5-brane wind around a suitable supersymmetric 4-cycle p in m 6 with
non-vanishing triple self-intersection: p 3 6= 0. although it is known that these cf t2 can
thoroughly reproduce the correct bekenstein-hawking entropy in the microscopic level, it is

still a non-trivial problem to analyse the detailed spectra of chiral primaries. the present

work is motivated by this fact.

to resolve the diculty to study the n = (0, 4) scf t2 derived from this conguration of

m5, we shall choose another way. that is, we will work out in a t-dualized framework. we
focus on the limited examples m 6 = t 6 or t 2  k3 through this paper, and can easily nd
that the above brane congutation of m5 is equivalent by t-duality to the system of d1-d5-

tn5 in iib string theory. (here tn5 means taub-nut 5-brane, also sometimes called

kk 5-brane, which is dened as a taub-nut solution in the transversal 4-dimensional

space). we take this brane conguration as the starting point to analyse the n = (0, 4)

scf t2 following the several authors [10, 11]. the advantage to do so is as follows: the d1-

d5 system leads to the well-known and well-studied n = (4, 4) scf t2 we already mentioned,
and putting these branes at the location of singularity of taub-nut ( ale) can be also

1

described by the familiar procedure [12], which is realized by imposing suitable projection

on the chan-paton (cp) indices. we shall call this projection as the quiver projection

through this paper. in this manner we can reduce our problem to a tractable one. we will

dene the physical hilbert space of the desired (0, 4) scf t2 by directly imposing the quiver

projection on that of the (4, 4) scf t2, and will obtain the complete agreement between the
chiral primary states and the spectrum of kk excitations in the 5d sugra on ads3  s2
under the maldacena limit.

this paper will be organized as follows:

in section 2 we give a short review about some known results of the 5-dimensional sugra
with ads3  s2-geometry. particularly, we demonstrate the brane conguration on which
our construction of the boundary scf t2 is based.

our main discussions will be presented in section 3. we there give our proposal of the

boundary n = (0, 4) scf t2 as the one constructed by making use of the quiver techniques

[12], and explore the detailed spectrum of the chiral primary states. our analyses consist

of three parts; the single particles in the untwisted sector (of the symmetric orbifold), the

single particles in the twisted sectors, and lastly we discuss the spectrum of the general multi-

particle states. we will nd out the complete agreement between the bps kk spectrum
of the ads3  s2-sugra and the chiral primaries in the quiver (0,4) scf t2 we will
dene. we also emphasize, especially in relation to the analysis on multi-particles, that our

scf t2 dened by the quiver techniques is not equivalent with that dened by the usual

orbifoldization. we observe that the results of sugra support the quiver (0,4) scf t2, not

the one obtained by orbifoldization.

in section 4 we summarize our results and give a few comments about open problems.

2 5d sugra on ads3  s2

in this section we briey survey some known results with respect to the 5-dimensional
sugra dened in the space-time ads3s2 for our convenience. we begin with the simplest
example: m-theory compactied on m 6 = t 6. we can also present the similar arguments

2

for the case of m 6 = t 2  k3.

for the 6-torus m 6 = t 6, the m5-brane wrapped around a suitable susy 4-cycle

which we previously mentioned means nothing but the three intersecting 5-branes [13]. let
(x5, x6, . . . , x11) be the coordinates along the internal space m 6, and consider the following
5-brane conguration (we of course regard x0 as the time coordinate);

 q1 m5s extending along the (016789),
 q2 m5s extending along the (01567 11),
 q3 m5s extending along the (01589 11).

the 11-dimensional metric corresponding to this brane conguration is given as follows [13];

ds2

11 = (h1h2h3)2/3 {(h1h2h3)1((dx0)2 + (dx1)2) + (h1h2)1((dx6)2 + (dx7)2)
+ (h2h3)1((dx5)2 + (dx11)2) + (h3h1)1((dx8)2 + (dx9)2) + (dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2))o ,

(2.1)
where (r, , ) stands for the spherical coordinates along the (x2, x3, x4)-directions which are

transversal to all of the branes, and the harmonic functions hi in this transversal space

should be dened as

hi(r) def= 1 +

2lp qi
2rv1/3  1 +

lp qi
4rv1/3 .

(2.2)

in the expressions of this harmonic functions lp means the 11-dimensional planck length
(which is dened, in our convention, by g11 = 167l9
p from the 11-dimensional newton
constant g11), 2  4 means the area of unit 2-dimensional sphere and we set the volume
of the internal space m 6 as vol(m 6) = v (2lp )6. under the maldacena limit, that is,

d  q1q2q3  , with l  lp (cid:18) d
v (cid:19)

1/3

>> lp xed,

(2.3)

this metric reduces to that of ads3  s2  m 6;

dx+dx +

(d2 + sin2 d2) + ds2(m 6),

(2.4)

u!2
ds2 =   l

l(cid:19)2
du2 +(cid:18)u
where we set u = 2lr, x = x0 + x1.

it is proposed [1] that the boundary cft for this example should correspond to an
n = (0, 4) scf t2 dened on the triple intersection of m5s (x0, x1-directions). this cft
is the simplest example among those studied in [8, 9] and was rst considered in [13] in the

3

context of the microscopic analysis on black-hole entropy. its central charge can be evaluated

under the large n limit (2.3) by counting the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom.

we can also evaluate it by means of the famous formula by brown-hennaux [14] c =

3l
2g3
according to the discussion given in [15]. recalling that the 3-dimensional newton constant

g3 is computed as

4lp

, (2.5)

we can immediately obtain the familiar central charge c = 6d which reproduces the correct

bekenstein-hawking entropy.

although this evaluation seems satisfactory, this is not the whole story in the ads3/cf t2-

correspondence. this scft dened on the triple intersection of 5-branes is not so powerful

to analyse the detailed structure of spectrum. therefore, we shall take a dierent framework.

it is easy to nd the following equivalence by t-duality;

m/(t 6(56789 11))

q1 m5 (016789)

q2 m5 (01567 11)

q3 m5 (01589 11)




=

iia/(t 5(56789))

t 5t 6t 7

 iib/( t 5(56789))

q1 ns5 (016789)

q2 d4 (01567)

q3 d4 (01589)

q1 t n5 (016789)

q2 d1 (01)

.
(2.6)

q3 d5 (016789)






in the last line t n5 (016789) strictly means that the transversal space (x2, x3, x4, x5) is
the taub-nut space with the monopole charge q1 (the s1-ber is along x5). lastly, let us
consider the decompactication limit of taub-nut space, which means (x2, x3, x4, x5) gets
the structure of the ale space ale(aq11)  c2/zq1.

in this way we have led to the system of q1  q1q2 d1 and q1  q1q3 d5 wrapped around
t 4(6789), which are located at the singularity of the orbifold c2/zq1 (the 2345th-directions).
(the origin of the extra factor q1 in the brane charges is the existence of mirror images by
the orbifold zq1-action.) this brane conguration leads to the geometry ads3s3/zq1 t 4.
some analyses on this ads3 geometry were given in [10] and, more recently, the studies

from the viewpoints of string theory along the same line as [16] were presented in [11].

however, we shall take a route which is dierent from them and is rather analogous to the

works [17, 18, 19, 20]. the familiar techniques to put d-branes at the locations of orbifold

4

singularities were invented by douglas-moore [12] and we shall call this procedure the quiver

projection in this paper. in the next section we will construct the boundary scft by means

of this projection from the well-known (4, 4)-scft corresponding to the q1d1-q5d5 system
which has the near-horizon geometry ads3  s3  m 4. furthermore, we will explore the
spectrum of chiral primaries in this quiver (0, 4)-scft, and will observe how we can get
the complete agreement with the kk-spectrum of 5d sugra on ads3  s2.

in the case of m 6 = t 2  k3 we can likewise t-dualize the orginal system, at least for
the elliptic k31. we can again arrive at the q1d1-q5d5 system such that d5s are wrapped
around k3 and all of the branes are located at the orbifold point of c2/zq1. we can also make
up the boundary (0, 4) scf t2 by the quiver projection, but there is one subtle point. it is

known [8, 9] that the central charge of this boundary cft suers quantum correction, when
m 6 is a curved manifold. it seems dicult to realize this correction in the framework of our

quiver scf t2. however, since this correction becomes negligible if taking the maldacena

limit, we can expect it works in the k3 case, too.

to close this section let us present the bps kk-spectra on ads3s2m 6 sugra (m 6 =
t 6, t 2k3) which are given in [21, 6, 11, 22]. these spectra shold be encoded to the family of
the short representations of super lie group sl(2, r)lsu(1, 1|2)r describing the symmetry
of ads3  s2-sugra. the general irreducible representations of sl(2, r)l  su(1, 1|2)r
are classied by three half integers (h, h, j)  1
2z0. h denotes the highest
weight of sl(2, r)l-factor and h, j correspond to those of su(1, 1|2)r. the bps condition
can simply read as h = j. we here express the each short representation by the notation
(j ; s), where s def= h  h  h  j denotes the spin, in the similar manner as [6]. actually
s is equal to the spin of the lowest component of the bps multiplet in the ads3-space.

under these preparations the bps kk-spectrum for ads3  s2  t 6 can be written as
1of course, the moduli space of elliptic k3 is merely a subspace of the full moduli space of k3. but our

concern in this paper is to evaluate the degeneracy of chiral primaries, which does not depend on the generic

value of moduli.

the mass spectrum of kk excitations is given from the values of conformal weights by

the famous formula [2, 8, 6];

(2.9)

3 quiver n = (0, 4) scf t2 as the boundary cft

as was demonstrated in the previous seciton, the situation we should study is summarized

as follows;

 q1 d1 extending along (x0, x1).
 q5 d5 extending along (x0, x1, x6, x7, x8, x9), and the space along (x6, x7, x8, x9) is

m 4 = t 4, k3.

6

 the space (x2, x3, x4, x5) is the orbifold c2/zq1, and all of the branes sit at the orbifold

singular point x2 =    x5 = 0.
here we set q1  q1q2, q5  q1q3.

notice that our orbifold group zq1 acts along the directions transverse to all of the branes.
it is dierent from the situations intensively studied in [12], in which the orbifold group
acts along (x6, x7, x8, x9)-directions and we can get a natural interpretation of kronheimer-

nakajimas theorem with respect to the instantons on ale spaces [23] by means of the brane

theory.

nevertheless, we can apply the same techniques and can easily write down the inner

and outer quiver diagrams to encode the matter contents. by this prescription we can

obtain an n = (0, 4) supersymmetric theory which is an example of the general models with

(0, 4) susy discussed in [25, 26], called adhm gauged linear -model. in principle the

ir limit of its higgs branch will provide us the desired n = (0, 4) scf t2.

however, there are subtle points.

in the quantume level it is not easy to determine

exactly the low energy eective theory of the adhm linear -model, because we only have

less supersymmetries. moreover, even in the cases with n = (4, 4) susy, the famous
proposal of the target space symq1q5(m 4) is still a conjecture except the easiest example
m 4 = r4. no one succeeded in justifying this proposal completely from the viewpoint of
two-dimensional quantum gauge theory.2

this (4, 4) -model on symq1q5(m 4) nonetheless has a great success in ads3/cf t2-

duality [24, 6, 7, 28]. so it seems to be the model worth taking as a good starting point.

in order to dene our boundary n = (0, 4) scf t2, we shall directly carry out the quiver
projection on the n = (4, 4) orbifold scf t2 on symq1q5(m 4) in place of taking the ir limit

of the adhm linear -model. this is our standpoint on which the analyses in this paper

will be based.

2in fact, there is a dierent proposal of the ir eective theory [27]. this has the same degrees of freedom,

but a dierent discrete symmetry which should be gauged as orbifold cf t2. so, it may lead to the dierent

spectrum of chiral primaries.

7

3.1 chiral primaries of the quiver (0,4) scf t2 : untwisted sector

first, we discuss the simpler example: m 4 = t 4. let ,  =  be the spinor indices in
the (x2, x3, x4, x5)-space and a, a =  be those in the (x6, x7, x8, x9)-space (compactied on
t 4).

the description of the untwisted sector of (4,4) scf t2 on symq1q5(t 4) is elementary.
we have 4q1q5 numbers of free bosons x a a
(ai) (a = 0, . . . , q11
color indices, i = 0, . . . , q5  1 avor indices) as the fundamental elds, which roughly
correspond to the degrees of freedom of the 1-5 open strings. the superconformal sym-

(ai) and free fermions  a

(ai),  a

metry is realized by the following currents (we only write the left-mover.);

this generates the n = 4 (small) superconformal algebra (sca) with central charge c =
6q1q5. (the usual convention of su(2)-current is j i(z)  i
j (z) (i = 1, 2, 3).) the
subalgebra of zero-modes {l1, l0, ga
0 } and their counterpart of right-mover com-
poses the super lie algebra su(1, 1|2)l su(1, 1|2)r corresponding to the symmetry super-
group in ads3  s3 geometry.

0|i.

(3.3)

so, we can characterize the chiral primary states by the two quantum numbers (j, j) - spins
of the two su(2)-currents j , j  .

as is well-known, the chiral primary elds, which corresponds to the chiral primary states

by the standard operator-state correspondence in unitary cf t2, composes a ring by means

of the simple operator products that has no singularity. this ring is called chiral ring, and

from the viewpoints of ads3/cf t2-duality the generators of chiral ring are identied with

the single particle states [24] (see also [6]). so, let us call them the chiral primaries of single

particle type.

by taking the sq1q5-invariance into account, we can explicitely construct all of the chiral

primaries of single paritcle type in the untwisted sector;

(ns-ns vacuum)

needless to say, these correspond to the cohomology ring of t 4.

let us now try to reduce the (4,4) theory in the untwisted sector to the (0,4) scf t2

by the quiver techniques [12], and analyse the spectrum of chiral primaries of single-particle

type.
in order to introduce the quiver projection it is convenient to rewrite the indices
(ai) (a = 0, . . . , q1  1, i = 0, . . . , q5  1) as ((a, j) (i, j)), where a = q1a + j (a =
0, . . . , q2  1, j = 0, . . . , q1  1), i = q1i + j (i = 0, . . . , q3  1, j = 0, . . . , q1  1). dene the
complex coordinates z 1 = x2 + ix3, z 2 = x4 + ix5 and set z = 
. the actions

of the isometry group su(2)l  su(2)r along (x2, x3, x4, x5)-directions ( s3) are realized

by

(gl, gr)  su(2)l  su(2)r : z 7 glzgr.

in particular, let us consider the zq1  su(2)l action generated by gl = 

(  e2i/q1), in other words,

z 1 7 z 1, z 2 7 1z 2.

(3.6)

as was discussed in several papers (see for example [29]), this su(2)l  su(2)r is no other
than the r-symmetry group of (4,4) scf t2 considered above. therefore, we can expect
that orbifolding3 by this zq1-action breaks the susy of left-mover completely.

under these preparations the quiver projection associated to the orbifold group zq1 should

be dened as

x a a

((a,j+n), (i,j +n)) = x a a
 a
((a,j+n), (i,j +n)) = n  a
((a,j+n), (i,j +n)) =   a

((a,j), (i,j )).

((a,j), (i,j )),

((a,j), (i,j )),

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

it is not so dicult to check that this projection actually breaks susy down from (4,4)

to (0,4). we have no supercharges of left-mover after this projection is performed. obviously

the central charge c = 6

the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom decrease to 1/q1 by them, and hence we have
q1q5
q1  6q1q2q3 as expected. this evaluation is also consistent

moreover, the condition (3.7) suggests that the projected theory should have the target

space sym
more precisely the discrete symmetry we must gauged reduces to sq1q2q3 (zq1)q1q2q3  sq1q5.
in order to see how this (zq1)q1q2q3 acts on the cp indices, it may be useful to recast the cp
indices as

3the term orbifolding here is somewhat inaccurate, as was remarked in [18]. we will later discuss this

((a, j), (i, j))  (j, a, i ; n)  (a ; n),

(3.10)

point carefully, especially relating it with the analysis of multi-particle states.

10

where we set j  j  j  zq1 and n  j. we also introduced the abbreviated notation
a  (j, a, i)  zq1  zq2  zq3. the element m  {ma}  (zq1)q1q2q3 acts on (a ; n) in a
natural way;

(a ; n) 7 (a ; n + ma).

(3.11)

notice that this (zq1)q1q2q3-action is local in the sense that it acts independently for each
of the q1q2q3 numbers of cp indices a  (j, a, i). this fact will become important in our
later discussions about multi-particle states.

this (zq1)q1q2q3-invariance has no meaning for the right-mover, since it is trivially satised
because of (3.7), (3.9). but, taking acount of the condition for  a (3.8), we nd that only
the states which are su(2)l-neutral (modulo zq1) survives when the (zq1)q1q2q3-invariance
are imposed.

thanks to this fact, we can immediately obtain the spectrum of chiral primaries of the
single particle type in the untwisted sector. consider the su(1, 1|2)l-multiplets dened on
each chiral primary of (4, 4) theory (3.4), and we only have to pick up the su(2)l-neutral

primary states in this multiplet;

seem to be possible. they are indeed the 1/4 bps states in the (4,4) theory, and chiral pri-

maries in the sense of the (0,4) theory, because they have the su(2)l-invariance. however,

they (and their cousins) do not contribute to the elliptic genus of the (4,4) theory (in the
case of m 4 = k3, precisely speaking, and they should also exist for k3 = t 4/z2 after per-
forming the z2-orbifoldization)4, and thus they are expected to correspond to some unstable
excitations. to get a complete understanding of this subtlety we may perhaps need to study

in detail the modular property of our (0,4) model. it is beyond the scope of this paper, and

we would like to discuss this problem elsewhere. in any case we shall only consider the (0,4)

chiral primaries of the single particle type obtained from those for (4,4) theory, which are

surely stable excitations because they contribute to the (4,4) elliptic genus.

the analysis for the case of m 4 = k3 is also easy. since the spectrum of chiral primary
does not depend on the generic points of moduli space, we may simply regard as k3 = t 4/z2.
the constraint of z2-invariance kills the odd cohomologies. hence, in (3.12) only the states

it should be remarked that in the orbifold t 4/z2, we further have the z2-twisted sectors
which correspond to the blow-up modes of 16 xed points. in fact we must take account

of them to recover the full cohomology of k3. however, because all the contributions from

these twisted sectors are (1, 1)-cohomologies, we get no chiral primaries from these sectors

(the su(2)l-modules for them do not include neutral states). of course, this is not the

case when we deal with the twisted sectors of symmetric orbifold at the same time. we will

later observe how the chiral primaries corresponding to these extra (1, 1)-forms appear in
4in fact, in [6], the structures of the 1/4 bps states which have h = 1, j = 0, h  j = arbitrary, and can
contribute to the elliptic genus are concretely examined. it is there claimed that all of them are either some

descendants of the chiral primaries of single particle type (in the (4,4) sense) or some multi-particle states.

the bps states considered here (3.13) do not belong to this list.

the twisted sector of symmetric orbifold.

3.2 chiral primaries of the quiver (0,4) scf t2 : twisted sector

the analysis for the twisted sector is more complicated than that for the untwisted sector.

each twitsted sector of the symmetric orbifold corresponds to a yang tableau (n1, . . . , nl),

and this is decomposed into a set of zni-twisted sectors, each of which describes a single-

particle state with a large value of r-charge (see for example [24]).

since we are here concerned about only single particle states, we only have to learn

how to describe the zp-twisted sector which corresponds to the blow-up modes of one of
the orbifold singularities such that x a a
(ap1ip1). it is known that this can
be elegantly but somewhat abstractedly described on some fock space [30]. namely, one

(a0i0) =    = x a a

can prepare the bosonic and fermionic oscillators (in ramond sector) associated to all the
even and odd cohomology elements of m 4 respectively. the oscillators of the type 1()
(  h(m 4)) correspond to the untwisted sector and those of the type p() describe the
zp-twisted sector. although this description has many excellences, it may be more useful for

our purpose to describe concretely the chiral primaries in terms of the -model variables

themselves.

we must introduce the zp-twisted string or the long stirng with length p to describe
this sector. we label the objects in this sector by the index a  [(a0i0), . . . , (ap1ip1)],
ai = 0, . . . , q1  1, ii = 0, . . . , q5  1, such that (aiii) 6= (ajij) for i 6= j. the long string
coordinates for this sector (dened on the world-sheet 0    2 which is rescaled from
the p-times one 0    2p) is given as follows ( means each eld x a a,  a,   a);

a() = (arir)(p  2r),   2r

p

these variables x a a

can produce the superconformal currents of the central charge

c = 6 in the same way as the untwisted sector (3.1). however, the condition of zp-invariance
which should be imposed on the physical hilbert space leaves us only the modes n  pz for
the bosons and the ramond fermions, and the modes n  p(cid:18)1
+ z(cid:19) for the ns femions.
by this moding out, we can obtain the superconformal currents { ln, ga
r , j } properly

these generate the n = 4 sca with c = 6p. the anomaly term in the expression of ln
essentially corresponds to the schwarzian derivative of the conformal mapping z 7 zp).
observing these denitions (3.15), we can nd that the ns vacuum |0,ai of zp-twisted
sector (corresponding to the twist eld which creates a cut on the world-sheet by the state-

operator correspondence) should possess the following properties;

it may be slightly surprized that the ns vacuum |0,ai itself is not a chiral primary according

(3.15), one can

nd out that we must ll the ns vacuum with all the fermionic oscillators + a

zp-twisted sector are written in the following form;

|(q,q), (p  1)i = xa

|q,ai  | q,ai,

(3.19)

where the summation should be taken over all the possible zp-twisted strings labeled by a,
and the left(right)-moving parts are dened by

now, let us consider the reduction to the (0,4) theory. to observe how the quiver pro-

5this means that the chiral primary state |(q,q), (p  1)i is identied with the element p((q,q))|0i

of the fock space translating the cohomologies of the hilbert scheme [30, 24].

15

(as we already observed, when p = 2k + 1, the fermionic elds  a
a

,   a
a

should have the

half-integral mode expansions. it is straightforward to generalize our discussions here to this
case, and we omit it.) it is obvious that the set of twisted elds {(s)
a }s=0,...,p1 describes
the same degrees of freedom as a does. these should have the monodromies;

(s)

the meaning of the quiver projections for x a a (3.7) and   a (3.8) is very easy. as
was already mentioned, these simply reduce the degrees of freedom from symq1q5(m 4)
to symq1q2q3(m 4). thus we only have to deal with the twisted sectors of the type; a 
[(a0i0), . . . , (ap1ip1)]  [(a0; n0), . . . , (ap1; np1)], where ai  zq1  zq2  zq3, ni  zq1
and, among other things, ai 6= aj (i 6= j) holds.

let us next discuss the (zq1)q1q2q3-invariance. let m  {ma}  (zq1)q1q2q3, and we dene

the action of (zq1)q1q2q3 on the cp indices of twisted sectors as follws;

m(a) = h(a0; n0 + ma0), . . . , (ap1; np1 + map1)i ,
where a  [(a0; n0), . . . , (ap1; np1)] as above. this acts trivially on x a a

1
recall that, when p is odd, |0,ai is su(2)l-neutral, but it has an extra su(2)l-charge 
2
for the cases with even p. the conditions (3.29), (3.30) again imply that only the states
possesing the 2j 3

0 -invariance survive after performing the quiver projection.

in summary the chiral primaries of the twisted sectors in (0,4) theory can be constructed

by the following procedures (we shall again focus on only the surely stable excitations as

we already commented):

 first, we should consider all the (single particle) chiral primaries in the twisted sectors

of symq1q2q3(m 4)-scf t2 (not for symq1q5(m 4)).

 second, consider su(1, 1|2)l-module over each of them, and pick up the primary states

such that

2j 3

0|i = |i,

(3.31)

which are the desired chiral primary states in our (0,4)-theory.

since we already know the explicit forms of chiral primaries of (4,4)-theory, it is straight-

forward to write down those for (0,4)-theory according to the above prescription. however,

to avoid unessential complexity, we here only present the spectrum of them. they corre-
spond to the short representations of sl(2, r)l  su(1, 1|2)r, and we express each of them
by (j; s), where

3

j
0|i(
( l0 

l0|i) = j|i
l0)|i = s|i

(r-charge)

(spin)

(3.32)

in the same way as in sugra. moreover, we express the space of sl(2, r)l  su(1, 1|2)r
irreps. in which lowest component is a boson (fermion) by h(+)

scft (h()

scft) as before.

here we give a comment before we exhibit the spectrum of chiral primaries. by the

q1k
2

above prescription we should take acount of not only the states with j 3
0 = 0 but also with
j 3
0 -charges correspond to
0 =
the very massive modes in string theory. in fact, in the original ads3  s2-geometry this
charge is identied with the winding along x5-direction (in our t-dualized framework, the

(k  z0). however, the states possessing non-zero j 3

kk momentum along the taub-nut circle), and hence the states with this winding are
much heavier than the kk excitations on s3 (we are now assuming these winding modes
have the masses of the extent of planck mass, and the kk excitations on s3 have the masses

17

valid.

planck.), which means these states are negligible in the region where sugra is

notice also that our quiver scf t2 describes the branes at the xed point of the orbifold
c2/zq1, which is the decompactication limit of the taub-nut space. so, the stringy heavy
states just mentioned become lighter under this orbifold limit. the exsistence of these
extra states with non-zero j 3

0 -charges in our quiver scf t2 does not mean a failure of the

ads3/cf t2-correspondence.

therefore, we here only present the spectra of the light chiral primaries with vanishing

j 3
0 -charges, which should be compared with the results of sugra. we will give the complete
spectra including non-zero j 3
0 -charges in appendix, since they have rather complicated forms.
by including the contributions from all of the untwisted and twisted sectors, we can

obtain the following spectrum for m 4 = t 4 (we set d  q1q2q3 again);

let us now turn to the studies for m 4 = k3. as in the previous discussions in the

untwisted sector, we regard k3 = t 4/z2.

for the untwisted sector in the sense of z2-orbifold, we need to make little change in
the above results for m 4 = t 4. the requirement of z2-invariance simply kills the odd

18

cohomologies of t 4, and we obtain the contributions from the (4, 4) chiral primaries of the
following types; |(0,0), (p  1)i, |(2,0), (p  1)i, |(0,2), (p  1)i, |(2,2), (p  1)i and also the
four series of the type |(1,1), (p  1)i.

to get the complete spectrum we must also make the twisted sectors of z2-orbifold join
in our game. there are 16 twisted sectors corresponding to each xed points of t 4/z2. we
here only focus on one of them, because all of them have the same algebraic structure. at

the same time we take the zp-twisted sector in the sense of the symmetric orbifold.

in these expressions the extra zero-point energies and r-charges assigned to the ns vacuua

have their origins in these twisted mode expansions. the superconformal currents in this
twisted sector (that is, the twisted in the meaning of both t 4/z2 and the symmetric

orbifold) are also dened as before (3.15), and they give us only one chiral primary state for
each sector, which has the form |(1,1), (p  1)i;

of course, there are 16 independent such states corresponding to each twisted sectors of
t 4/z2, and they compensate the missing cohomologies of symq1q5(k3). thus we can get
the 20 sequences of the form |(1,1), (p  1)i by including also the 4 contributions from the
untwisted sector.

the next step is the same as that in the case of t 4. we can take the quiver projection

for this twisted sector and can obtain the spectrum which is modded out by 2j 3

0 . gathering

the contributions from all the sectors, we can lastly obtain the next spectrum for k3;

to end this section we present a comparison with the results of sugra given in the

previous section. by comparing the results (2.7), (2.8) and (3.33), (3.39), we can notice that

both are equivalent except the following slight dierences:

first, we of course have now the upper bound for r-charges, which is essentially the one

rst remarked in [24] (stringy exclusion principle). this dierence is not problematic at all,
as far as we work in the suciently large d  q1q2q3 assumed in the maldacena conjecture.
the second dierence is owing to the existence of the chiral primaries |(0,2), (0)i, |(2,0), (0)i
in the (4,4) theory. they correspond to the degrees of freedom which essentially exists only

on the boundary (called singleton) [21, 6]. thus we have no contradiction even if we

cannot nd them in the bulk theory.

20

in this way we can conclude that the spectrum of chiral primaries of our quiver scf t2 is
consistent with that of the sugra in the ads3 s2-geometry at least for the single particle
states. we must further study the multi-particle states to claim the complete agreement

between them. the next subsection will devote to this subject.

3.3 discussions about multi-paritcle states

in the previous subsection we have shown that our quiver scf t2 can produce the spec-
trum of single particle states which is consistent with that of sugra on ads3  s2. the
essential part of our discussion was that the quiver projection works on the hilbert space as
moding out by 2j 3

0 . at this point one might ask the followin questions:

is the quiver projection truly needed? why cant we dene the hilbert space of the bound-
0|i = |i on the hilbert space of

ary (0,4) scf t2 by directly imposing the constraints 2j 3
(4,4) scf t2 on symq1q5(m 4)?

the answer to the rst question is yes, and we can answer to the second question as

follows: one of the evidences for us to need the quiver projection is given by evaluating the
degrees of freedom. if we naively mode out by 2j 3

0 to dene the (0,4) theory (to get a more

suitable candidate of the (0,4) theory, one should further incorpolate the twisted sectors of

this orbifoldization to ensure the modular invariance), we will obtain the (0,4) scf t2 with

the same central charge c = 6q1q5 as that of (4,4) theory. but we want the scf t2 with

the 1/q1 times degrees of freedom. as was already seen, the quiver projection actually yields

the (0,4) scf t2 with the central charge c =

6q1q5

q1  6q1q2q3.

the second reason why we need to consider the quiver projection is more crucial and has

a deep relationship to the analysis of the multi-particle states. roughly speaking, in order to

be consistent with the spectrum of sugra, the multi-particle states in the boundary scf t2
should have the structure  o1o2   |0i, where oi denotes some descendant of the chiral
primary of single particle type. in [7] it is shown that, in the (4,4) scf t2 on symq1q5(k3),

general bps states which contribute to the elliptic genus have indeed such forms, if their

q1q5 + 1

q1q5

. in other words the correspondence of the chiral
r-charges are less than
primaries between the ads3  s3-sugra and the boundary (4,4) scf t2 are satisfactory

in the level of multi-particle states at least in the large q1q5-limit6.

the constraints 2j 3

now, we rst try to dene the hilbert space of the (0,4) theory h(0,4) by simply imposing
0|i = |i on the hilbert space of (4,4) theory h(4,4). (here, we overlook
the problem about the central charge we already mentioned.) as we observed in the previous
section, the h(0,4) so dened includes the suitable spectrum of the single particle states. but,
how about the multi-particles? if we admit the complete agreement between the spectrum
of (4,4) scf t2 and the ads3  s3-sugra mentioned above, we will obtain the following
general forms of the bps states of (0,4) scf t2;

|i = o1o2   |0i,

[2j 3

0 , oi} = rioi, xi

ri  q1z,

(3.40)

where oi denotes the 1/4 bps observables of the single particle type in the sense of (4,4)
susy (only the right-moving susy are preserved), and the reader should read [ , } as the
(anti-)commutator for the bosonic (fermionic) eld oi. the important point is that each ri
need not be a multiple of q1, although |i must be zq1-invariant. such |i is of course a
multi-particle states in the sense of the (4,4) theory, but generally not in the (0,4) theory,
because the constituents oi may not belong to the physical hilbert space h(0,4).

on the other hand, the hilbert space of multi-particle states in sugra should be dend

by taking the (symmetric or anti-symmetric) tensor products of single particle states. this
fact brings us the result that the sugra on ads3  s3/zq1 should include only the multi-
particle states of the following type;

|i = o1o2   |0i,

[2j 3

0 , oi} = rioi,

(ri  q1z).

(3.41)

clearly the states with the form (3.41) merely spans the subspace of that for (3.40). we

thus face the existence of many missing states, if we adopt the simple prescription of orb-
ifoldization by 2j 3
0 !

next let us observe how we can resolve this inconsistency by considering the quiver

projection. we should notice that each of single-paricle operators has the next cp index

structure; oi = xa(i) oi, a(i), where a(i)  h(a(i)

0 ; n(i)

0 ), . . . (a(i)

pi1; n(i)

pi1)i labels one of the zpi-

twisted sector. (if pi = 1, one should understand it as the untwisted sector, of course.) the
6the analysis by means of elliptic genus given in [7] has no power in the case of m 4 = t 4, because the

elliptic genus is trivially zero for the toroidal model. but, we here assume the similar good correspondence
of bps states exists for t 4, too.

22

general multi-particles in the (4,4) theory have the forms;

|i = o1o2   |0i  

xa(1) o1, a(1)


xa(2) o2, a(2)


   |0i.

(3.42)

0 =    = m(i)

pi1 = m(i), where m(i)

the quiver projection again brings us the requirements of the (zq1)q1q2q3-invariance with
respect to the cp indices. especially, we can take an element m  {ma} of (zq1)q1q2q3 such
that m(i)
. it is the most important to notice that
we can choose these m(i)  zq1 independently for each i, because of the locality of our zq1-
symmetry. therefore, according to the discussions given in the previous subsections, we nd
that the 2j 3
oi, in contrast to the usual orbifoldization of cft.

0 -invariance are separately imposed on each of the single particle components

r  ma(i)

r

in this way we can conclude that the quiver projection does reproduce the consistent

spectrum of multi-particles (3.41). we can also rephrase: the orbifoldization of bulk sugra

does not correspond to the orbifoldization of the boundary cft, rather correspond to the

quiver projection of it!

4 summary and comments

in this paper we have proposed a candidate for the suitable boundary scf t2 which is
dual to the sugra on ads3  s2  m 6 (m 6 = t 6, t 2  k3) by the quiver techniques.
we presented a detailed analysis on the chiral primaries, including all of the twisted sectors

of symmetric orbifolds, and obtained the spectrum which is consistent with sugra in the

maldacena limit.

it is plausible and may not be so surprised that the quiver projection on the single particle

states leads to the simple moding out prescription by 2j 3

0 . but for the multi-particle states,

this procedure of orbifolding leads to the wrong results. we must carefully consider the

quiver projection, not the orbifolding, to get a consistent spectrum of the multi-particles.

however, because of just this fact that our quiver scf t2 is not an usual orbifold scf t2,

it will become a subtle problem whether it has actually the modular invariance. needless

to say, the modular invariance is an important consistency condition of cf t2 on torus,

23

and in addition, in the thermodynamical studies on the ads3-gravity including some btz

black-holes [33], it is expected to yield a very powerful tool [4, 24]. the check of modular

invariance for the quiver scf t2 seems a challenging and an important problem, and we

hope to investigate this problem in future.

one of the natural generalizaitons of the studies in this paper is the works for m 6 = cy3.
although the analyses for the completely general cy3 seem very dicult, it might be possible

to apply our formulation at least to some elliptic cy3. we can reduce by the ber-wise

t-duality the original system of m5 to the one composed of a d3 wrapped around a susy

2-cycle in the base manifold of the elliptic bration, located at the singularity of an orbifold.

it may be also interesting to compare our quiver scf t2 with the space-time cft [11]

given in the string theoretical approach along the line of [16].

it is worth remarking the

fact that the quiver projection can completely reproduce the (0,4) version of the stringy

exclusion principle of [24] (that is, the unitarity bound of the arbitrary chiral primary is
j  q1q2q3 
mentioned, and the former is easily shown by counting the degrees of freedom and by taking

, and that for the single particle is j 

. the latter was already

q1q2q3

acount of the fermi statistics.). whether this bound can be also explained in the framework

of [11] is an important test. to answer this question completely, we may need rst to

study carefully the unitarity bound for the (4,4) space-time cft [16], maybe based on the

discussions given in [34]. to this aim the approach from the matrix string theory [35] may

become more ecient than that of the old fashioned string on ads3 back-ground. some

studies along this line will be presented in [36].

a complete spectra of the chiral primaries in quiver

(j; s)k for the irreducible sl(2, r)l  su(1, 1|2)r-modules in which all the states should
satisfy
