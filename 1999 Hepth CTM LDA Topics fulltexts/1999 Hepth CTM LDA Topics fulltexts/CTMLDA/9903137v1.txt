abstract

we investigate the integrability of the so(n ) principal chiral model on a half-
line, and nd that mixed dirichlet/neumann boundary conditions (as well as pure
dirichlet or neumann) lead to innitely many conserved charges classically in invo-
lution. we use an anomaly-counting method to show that at least one non-trivial
example survives quantization, compare our results with the proposed reection ma-
trices, and, based on these, make some preliminary remarks about expected boundary
bound-states.

1 the principal chiral eld

we rst recall some preliminaries. a full treatment of the model on the innite line can
be found elsewhere[1]. the principal chiral model may be dened by the lagrangian

l = tr(cid:16)g1g(cid:17) ,

(1)

where the eld g(x) takes values in a compact lie group g, here chosen to be so(n). it
has a global gl  gr symmetry with conserved currents

j(x, t)l

 = g g1,

j(x, t)r

 = g1g

(2)

which take values in the lie algebra g of g: that is, j = jata (for jl or jr: henceforth we
drop this superscript) where ta are the generators of g. the equations of motion are

j(x, t) = 0 ,

j  j  [j, j] = 0 ,

symmetries (parities)

2(t  x). the pcm has additional involutive discrete

(5)

and, for g = so(n),

 : g 7 mgm 1



jl 7 mjlm 1 ,

jr 7 mjrm 1 ,

(6)

where m is an o(n) matrix with determinant 1.

2 boundary conditions for the half-line

we place the model on the half-line  < x < 0. immediate suggestions for boundary
conditions (bcs) might be the (free) neumann condition 1g = 0 at x = 0, implying
jl
1 (0, t) = jr
0 (0, t) =
0 (0, t) = 0. following moriconi and de martino[2], we generalize these to mixed conditions,
jr
with (both l and r) j0(0, t) = 0 on m components of the quantum vector multiplet, and
j1(0, t) = 0 on the n m others. this implies

1 (0, t) = 0, or the dirichlet condition 0g = 0 at x = 0, implying jl

j1(0, t)  so(m) ,

j0(0, t)  so(n m) ,

(7)

which, along with j  0 as x  , we shall take as our classical bcs. we have not
attempted to nd bcs which distinguish l from r. neither have we found the boundary
lagrangian corresponding to the dirichlet conditions.

it immediately follows from (3) that

1j0(0, t) = 0j1(0, t)  so(m)

1j1(0, t) = 0j0(0, t)  so(n m) ,

and thence that all higher derivatives of j0 and j1 at x = 0 are in either the so(m) or the
so(n m) subgroup.

3 local conserved charges on the half-line

in recent work[1] we investigated local conserved charges on the full line, and found that
the densities of the (odd-spin s) simple charges

qs = z 



tr(js+1

+ ) ,

qs = z 



tr(js+1
 )

(which arise from the conservation laws

tr(js+1

+ ) = 0 ,

+tr(js+1

 ) = 0 (cid:17)

(8)

(9)

must be generalized to certain polynomials in order to obtain a set which commute both
mutually and with the pfaan charge, which exists only for n even, and arises from

(cid:16)i1i2...in 1in (j+)i1i2...(j+)in 1in(cid:17) = 0 .

we rst demonstrate that our bcs lead to conservation of

on the half-line. this follows from

q|s|  qs + qs

dx 0tr(js+1

+ ) + 0tr(js+1
 )

dx 1tr(js+1

+ )  1tr(js+1
 )



dq|s|
dt



= z 0
= z 0
= tr(cid:16)j(0, t)s+1

 (cid:17) ;
+  j(0, t)s+1

(10)

(11)

(12)

because s is odd, the trace always is always of the form tr(j0(0, t)j1(0, t)...), and so vanishes.
further, from the calculation on the full line[1], we see that on the half-line

{q|r| , q|s|} = (const) [tr(tcj+(0, t)s) tr(tcj+(0, t)r)  tr(tcj(0, t)s) tr(tcj(0, t)r)]

= (const) tr(cid:16)j(0, t)r+s  j+(0, t)r+s(cid:17)

by completeness, and so also vanishes. the same reasoning ensures conservation and
commutation of the polynomial charges. however, it does not imply the conservation of

the pfaan charge, and we have found no subtler reasoning which does so. thus the simple
charges (11) are the maximal commuting set we have found.

for the group so(n) the pfaan charge is the only charge which is odd under  . further,
if we had considered su(n), where conserved charges on the full line exist for s both odd

3

and even, the reasoning above would have failed to guarantee conservation of the even-s
charges, which are precisely those odd under . our suspicion is therefore that, in general,

only charges which are even under all such parities are conserved on the half-line with
mixed bcs, so that boundary scattering will mix parity-doublets. this is reminiscent of
the situation in ane toda eld theories[3], where general bcs did not imply conservation
of odd-spin charges.

finally we consider quantum charge conservation. here the only method available is
the anomaly-counting of goldschmidt and witten[4], and the only non-trivial (i.e. s > 1)
charge which this method guarantees to be conserved on the full-line, and which we have

found to be classically conserved on the half-line, is that for s = 3. the point is that the
classical conservation law is modied by quantum anomalies[4,1] to become

tr(j4

(for some unknown ci), the most general anomaly possible with the correct symmetries.
on the full line it is enough for conservation that the right-hand side is a total derivative,
but on the half-line we must check[2] that the coecients of each ci individually satisfy the
procedure laid out in (12). they do so, and there is thus at least one non-trivial quantum
conserved charge on the half-line, which should be enough to ensure quantum integrability.

4 boundary s-matrices and the spectrum

recall that the bulk spectrum consists of particle multiplets with masses ma = 2m sin(cid:16) a

in representations (v, v ) of gl  gr, where v is a reducible representation of g whose
highest component is the ath fundamental representation of g. these run from a = 1 to
a = n  1 where n = 2n + 1, or a = n  2 where n = 2n. there are also spinor multiplets:

n 2(cid:17),

in fact the particle
one in the former case, two in the latter, which form a  -doublet.
multiplets represent a larger yangian algebra of non-local charges, yl(g)  yr(g), of which
they are the fundamental irreducible representations.

4

on the half-line, if we are correct in believing that odd-parity charges are not conserved,
0 dx which generate
gl  gr were considered on the half-line by mourad and sasaki[5], who pointed out that

the parity-doublets will be broken. further, the charges qa = r ja

dqa
dt

= ja

1 (0, t) .

(13)

those qa corresponding to a residual so(n  m)l  so(n  m)r symmetry therefore
remain conserved, as might be expected given that the bc was free for precisely those
components. we have found no residue of the non-local charges and thus of the yangian

symmetry, however.

let us nish by comparing our results briey with the reection matrices which, building
on the work of cherednik[6], we have constructed[7] for the scattering of the rst (vector)
and second (adjointsinglet) (as representations of g) multiplets of the bulk theory o

the boundary. these contain a residual so(n m) symmetry, and so might be expected
to match the bcs given. the decomposition of the boundary s-matrices appears not to

respect any residual yangian symmetry, again as expected.

the rst and second multiplet s-matrices take the form

k1() = 1() (p   [n  2m]p +)

k2() = 2() (cid:16)p 

a(cid:17) ,
a  [n 2m 2]p2 + [n 2m 2][n 2m +2]p +

where 1 and 2 are scalar prefactors[7] with no physical-strip poles, and

[x] =

 + ix/2h
  ix/2h

(14)

(15)

(with h = 2n  2). p + and p  are orthogonal projectors, of dimensions m and n m
respectively, taking the forms

p + =   im l
0 !

0

and

p  =   0 l

0 inm ! ,

(16)

where l is an m  (n  m) matrix which cannot be determined by the boundary ybe
or the crossing/unitarity condition. p +
a project similarly onto the second-rank
antisymmetric tensor, whilst p2 is a mixed projector for which we have no interpretation.
to describe the principal chiral model we must use

a and p 

x1() k1 l()  k1 r() ,

5

where x1() is a cdd factor with a zero at  = n 2m
i (and no poles on the physical strip),
introduced so that the overall pole here remains simple. (notice also that if boundary
scattering really does mix parity-doublets then some more complicated construction would
be needed if we were dealing with spinor, as opposed to vector, multiplets.)

2h

what is l for our boundary conditions? recall our comment at the end of section two,
that at x = 0 not only j0 and j1 but also all their (time- and space-)derivatives are in either
the so(m) or the so(n m) subgroup. if the same is true of the boundary lagrangian,

then there will be no operator in the model which can link the m and nm sub-multiplets,
and we must have l = 0.

to understand the full pole structure, and thus the spectrum, is a longer-term project.
fusing to obtain higher projectors is a dicult calculation, and without doing so we can

make no denite statements: fused scalar prefactors can easily be vitiated by cancellations
in the matrix structure. however, it is simple to see that ka will have a pole factor
[n  2m + 2a  2], and we believe that this projects onto the so(m)-restriction of the
ath antisymmetric tensor. following the ideas of ghoshal and zamolodchikov[10], in which
a pole at i0 in ka leads to a boundary bound-state (bbs) of mass ma cos 0, the bbs
spectrum may therefore be expected, for m < n/2, to include states of mass

(higher than this and the poles leave the physical strip), with the ath multiplet being the

ath antisymmetric so(m) tensor. notice that the ath multiplet is degenerate in mass, and
has the same dimension as, the (m a)th. as a increases beyond m > n/2 the number
a suitable x1 may be obtained by setting x = 1+2m 2n in a minimal version (that is, with
coupling-constant dependence removed) of (3.40) of fring and koberle[8]; we do not reproduce it
here.

 if l = 0 then we might, following the l  n  l reciprocity noted[9] for su (n) boundary s-
matrices broken by diagonal boundary terms to su (l)  su (nl)  u (1), expect an m  nm
symmetry. but this would place free and dirichlet bcs on the same footing, with residual
so(n  m )  so(m ) symmetry, contradicting (13); further, our reection matrices are not
invariant under m  n m .

of states falls, with a reciprocity m  hm, though this does not extend to the masses,
whose average increases as m increases, as seems natural for these bcs.

finally we note that the scattering described here is o the boundary ground state, but
reection matrices k [b]
a () also exist for the scattering of the ath particle o the bth bbs.
for our matrices (14) we have checked explicitly, using the bootstrap mechanism for these
states, that the second bbs appears as a pole in k [1]
1 .
