abstract

after some recalls on the standard (non)-linear  model, we discuss the interest of b.r.s.
symmetry in non-linear  models renormalisation. we also emphasise the importance of
a correct denition of a theory through physical constraints rather than as given by a
particular lagrangian and discuss some ways to enlarge the notion of renormalisability.

1 introduction

the subject of non-linear  models is relevant to this meeting for two reasons :

 carlo becchi has been involved in that eld in several occasions. a tentative list could

be :

 axial anomaly in a linear  model with fermions (1973) [1],

 non-linear  model and the bosonic string (1986-1988) [2],

 renormalisability and i.r. niteness in non-linear  models on coset spaces (1987-

1988) [3],

 non-linear  model with wess-zumino term (1989) [4],

 non-linear  model with (4,0) supersymmetry (1990) [5].

 in paris, with galliano valent and francois delduc [6], between 1983 and 1987 we studied
the quantisation of non-linear  models in 2 space-time dimensions for a large class of
target spaces including cp 1, cp n, the grassmannians, kahler symmetric then kahler
homogeneous ones. after his sabbatical year in paris in 1981, we kept contact with carlo
and his group and i had the chance to suggest a collaboration between our two groups,
which led to the renormalisation of all coset-space models with the algebraic methods `a la
b.r.s. [3]. my personal interest in that eld was mostly its use as a toy model to discuss
new theoretical ideas such as on shell renormalisation and the enlargment of the notion
of what a renormalisable theory might be.

in the rst part of this talk, i will recall some well known facts on non-linear  models whose
physical interest goes back to current algebra, p.c.a.c., broken symmetries and goldstone
mechanism. other elds such as statistical models in 2 +  dimensions, 1/n non perturbative
methods, mass gap computations or string vacuum description, will not be considered (see
however the talk of francois delduc [7]).

in a second part, i will explain the power of b.r.s. methods in that eld, the possible
apparent non-renormalisability and end with some open questions on generalised renormal-
isability.

2 the old o(n+1)  model.

2.1 the linear  model.

in their famous paper, gellmann and levy [8] present several lagrangians ensuring a realisation
of the partially conserved axial current (p.c.a.c.) observation ; one of them was proposed
by schwinger [9] and writes :

l = (1/2)[(~)2 + ()2]  (1/2)m2[~2 + 2] + (/4)[~2 + 2]2 + l breaking ,

(1)

where the breaking of o(n + 1) to o(n) is given by a non vanishing  eld expectation value,
resulting from a linear

l breaking = c  .

in presence of the term (2), the axial current conservation is broken according to the strong
p.c.a.c.- adler condition :

j a i
 (x) = i  i , x

 < j a i

 (x)x >= c < i(x)x > + contact terms .

(5)

note that, in a nice paper of 1973 [1], carlo becchi gave the rst complete analysis of a linear
 model with fermions, dened by the requirement of the p.c.a.c.-adler condition (5).

2.2 the non-linear sn model.

in their paper, gellmann and levy also proposed another lagrangian, taking into account the
experimental absence of any particle  similar to the pions ; moreover, it also explains the
smallness of the mass of the pions when compared to others hadrons. thanks to the constraint

~2 + 2 = f 2
 ,

i generators are now non-linear ones thanks to the replacement  = qf 2

the o(n + 1) symmetry is now non-linearly realised [10]. the algebra (4) is left unchanged
but the w a
  ~2 . the
pion eld belongs to the symmetric space sn = o(n + 1)/o(n) . the lagrangian (1) now
describes massless particles. the non zero mass of the physical pions - and the correlative non
exact conservation of the axial current - will result either from an explicit breaking

l = cqf 2

  ~2 ,

or from a nambu-golstone mechanism, through the spontaneous breaking of the o(n + 1)
symmetry to the vector o(n) one. the axial symmetry is now non-linearly realised,
according to :

and the axial current is :

  ~2 ,   ~ = ~(~.~) ,

j a i

 (x) = qf 2

  ~2i  iqf 2

  ~2 with j a i

 (x) = c i(x) .

(7)

at the end of the sixties, physicists use the geometry of coset spaces g/h to study various
realisations of the chiral symmetry [ understood as being rather su (2)su (2)
o(3) ] ; later
on, this geometrical approach was generalised, in the framework of 2-dimensional eld theory,
to an arbitrary riemmannian manifold (see [11] for a review), as i recall in the next subsection.

2.3 the non-linear  model.

given an arbitrary n-dimensional riemannian space, the lagrangian density is 1 written :

where

l = (ds)2 =

1

2 hg ij()iji ,

(8)

 the elds i are considered as coordinates on the manifold (the target space),

 g ij() is a metric on the manifold,

  is the space-time (inverse)metric.

when isometries are present - for instance when the manifold is an homogeneous one (coset
space g/h) -, they may be realised in various ways :

hw g/h

i

, ji = ifij() ;

(9)

fij() is constrained by the lie algebra structure and, thanks to the invariance of the distance,
related to the target space metric. for example, in the sn case, the standard parametrisation
gives :

fij(~) = ijqf 2

  ~2 , gij(~) = ij +

the stereographic parametrisation of schwinger [12] gives :

ij
  ~2 ;
f 2

fij(~) =

1
2

ij(f 2

  ~2) + ij , gij(~) =

ij

(f 2

 + ~2)2

;

note that the change of coordinates between these two parametrisations is non-linear :

~ =

f~

f +qf 2

  ~2

 ~ =

~

2f 2

 + ~2)

(f 2

.

other choices have been considered, for example one where det || gij ||= 1 ( charap [13]), with
the hope that they will lead, to all-order of perturbation theory, to nite s-matrix elements in
4 dimensions.

let us end that section by some comments.

2.4 remarks and comments.

 as physics should be independent of the parametrisation, in those days some people
consider the choice of parametrisation as a kind of gauge choice [13] : this idea was later
on taken up in the framework of the use of b.r.s. symmetry in non-linear  models and
non-linear eld redenitions [14].
notice that in a recent work, blasi et al. [15] prove the equivalence theorem - independence
of s matrix elements under reparametrisations of the elds - by that very idea : the new
terms in the lagrangian density, corresponding to a change of gauge, are b.r.s. variation
of something, and then unphysical ones.

1 here we do not consider a wess-zumino term in the lagrangian ( in two space-time dimensions, anti-
symmetric tensors  and bij would respectively replace  and gij ). note that carlo becchi has also been
involved in that situation ( in a work with olivier piguet [4]).

becchis birthday meeting..,february 1, 2008...

 a perturbative approach requires the choice of a special point s on the manifold m
(e.g. the south pole for stereographic parametrisation). however, if the manifold is an
homogeneous one, all points are equivalent. on the other hand, in the case of generalised
non-linear  models dened on an arbitrary target space, this independence results from
the existence at the quantum level of some compatibility conditions ensuring the existence
of a globally dened metric on m, as pointed out by friedan [11] and thoroughfully
discussed by carlo becchi at the 1987 ringsberg meeting [16].

 given some point s on m, it would be simpler to have a covariant perturbative ex-
pansion : as rst shown by meetz, normal coordinates give such a geometric formulation
[17]. at the one-loop order, the divergences are proportional to the ricci tensor of the
target space metric :

l  4(0)riccij [g()]ij .

for any symmetric space the ricci tensor is proportional to the metric tensor, then the
corresponding models are one-loop renormalisable. other situations, as well as an all-
order analysis, will be discussed in the next section.

 i would like to emphasize that, in the sixties, physicists tried to take the p.c.a.c. -
adler condition (5) as the very denition of a right theory. they considered the
lagrangians (8) as eective lagrangians and agreed on the importance of the algebra
of isometries - the ward identities. for example, many eorts [18] were done to enforce
p.c.a.c. in higher orders of perturbation theory (in 4 space-time dimensions).

it seems to me that after 1972 or so, there appeared some confusion : i feel that the successes
of dimensional regularisation for gauge theories - with the kind of magic that accompanies
its use - and the discovery of the standard model with its simple lagrangian, somehow
obscure the comprehension ; so, in the rest of this talk, i shall comment on the denition and
renormalisation of non-linear  models, this time in two space-time dimensions where they are
power counting renormalisable, the canonical dimension of the elds being zero.

3 from ward identities to b.r.s. symmetry.

in the presence of non-linear transformations of the elds, the standard trick is to add to the
eective action sources for these variations, as well as for their successive iterations. in doing
so, one may need an innite series of sources. this makes the quantum analysis a priori a
tremendous task : however, in some cases it may be carried out :

 when there exists a special parametrisation of the coset space such that the series of
transformations closes in a nite number of steps. this is the case for sn in the standard
parametrisation, as well as for the grassmannians [19] ;

 for kahler coset spaces, there is a u(1) charge, which helps to control the innite tower of
transformations. in particular, our group in paris was able to exhibit a parametrisation
where the isometries are holomorphic :

i = i + f i

jkjk + gi

jkjk ,  i = i + f i

jkj 

k + gi

jkj 

k ,

and so to give a complete all order analysis of the non-linear  models on homogeneous
kahler spaces [20].

6

g. bonneau..,february 1, 2008

but, if one recalls that the algebra involves commutators rather than products of transforma-
tions and that for coset spaces the commutator of two innitesimal transformations gives an-
other innitesimal group transformation, it is tempting to promote the parameters of the trans-
formations to anti-commuting ones (fadeev-popov constant ghosts). this idea was proposed
by alberto blasi and renzo collina for the sn model [21], and we used it in our genoa-paris
collaboration to obtain a complete algebraic proof of the renormalisability of any homogeneous
non-linear  model [3]. let us remark that :

 we replace ward identities by b.r.s. invariance and slavnov identities. no parametri-

sation being now specied, it is not surprising that the eld may be non-linearly renor-
malised 2. the b.r.s. invariant eective action writes :

(0) = s(1) + a(0) ,

(10)

where s is the slavnov operator, a(0) the invariant action and (1) an arbitrary local
functional in the elds and their derivatives, constrained by power counting arguments
and of fadeev-popov charge -1 ;

 this rst extension of the notion of renormalisability (as an innite number of
renormalisation constants appear) was rst exhibited by piguet and sibold in supersym-
metric models [22] and widely discussed at the 1987 workshop in ringsberg [14].

during this workshop, breitenlohner and maison exposed their eorts to quantise n=2 super
yang-mills theory [23] : on the one hand, they came up against the diculty of an innite
series of sources and realized that this b.r.s. idea will reveal itself very fruitful. on the other
hand, they also came up against the diculty of open algebras that occur in supersymmetric
theories (the algebra only closes on-shell and, moreover, in their situation, modulo a gauge
transformation). this problem of on-shell closed algebras was tackled by kallosh [24], solved
through the formalism of balatin and vilkovisky [25] and exemplied by piguet and sibold in
their analysis of wess-zumino model without auxiliary elds [26].

this oers a new success of b.r.s. formalism as one may dene a modied slavnov
operator and a modied eective action that take care of that non-closure of the algebra. the
challenge of breitenlohner and maison was nally answered by maggiore [27] ; moreover, this
method was also used in the study of n = 2 and n = 4 supersymmetric non-linear  models
[28] and recently applied by blasi and maggiore to broken algebras [29].

4 on some apparent non-renormalisabilities.

in that section, i want to illustrate on concrete examples, two problems that result from too
naive a use of dimensional regularisation.

4.1 non-linear renormalisation of the elds.

take the o(n) invariant lagrangian :

2 contrarily to the homogeneous kahler case where in our parametrisation, using ward identities, we prove

that the eld is not renormalised (z = 1)

dimensional regularisation gives as 1-loop eective lagrangian :

using standard arguments, one would conclude that for n 6= 2, the model is non-
renormalisable. this would be rather unpleasant as the lagrangian (11) is the ordinary sn
one in the stereographic parametrisation (subsect. 2.3). as shown in [30], this is a special case
of on-shell renormalisability, as the s-matrix elements can be renormalised through a coupling
and mass renormalisation :

indeed, result (12) may be understood as a non-linear renormalisation of the elds according
to :

4.2 unsucient denition of the model.

 for n = 2, the model appears to be 1-loop renormalisable with :

and zg2 = 1 ,

which means a vanishing  function at that order [32]. this is ne, but, at 2-loop order,
still in the minimal dimensional scheme, the calculation gives non-renormalisability. it
is then tempting to try an o(h) additive modication of the lagrangian : as shown
in [33], renormalisability is recovered, but the candidate 1-loop lagrangian is not
completely determined : this signals an unsucient denition of the model !

 the solution : for n = 2, the classical action satises the factorisation properties of
an integrable model (complex sine-gordon [34]). the model should be dened
by the non-production physical property, which means an innite number of
identities. with francois delduc, we prove that, enforcing one-loop factorisability,
the o(h) nite counterterms are completely xed and as an extra bonus we get the
vanishing of the  function at 2-loops order [33].

g. bonneau..,february 1, 2008

 comments :

 as the factorisation property is specic of 2-dimensional space-time, it is not
surprising that dimensional regularisation leads to quantum corrections, often
called spurious anomalies.

 in the eighties, many uncorrect claims were published - for example on a possible
violation of the adler-bardeen theorem in super-yang-mills. as shown in [35],
most of them were due to the identication of (minimal) regularisation with
a renormalisation scheme. the magic of minimal dimensional regularisation
leads to a blind faith understanding of the lagrangian as the theory, as opposed
to people involved in soft pions and chirality business in the sixties.

this is the right moment to recall a nice expression of carlo becchi :

the lagrangian is an opinion...

 for n > 2, the model is 1-loop non-renormalisable, even on-shell, as s-matrix elements
cannot be made nite through some renormalisation of the parameters of the classical
lagrangian (14). this should be related to the absence, in ordinary perturbation theory,
of o(n) symmetric integrable models.

5 concluding remarks : generalised renormalisability ?

in the previous subsections, we discussed how the study of non-linear  models, taken as toy
models, leads to trivial  extensions of the notion of renormalisability : possible non linear
renormalisations of the elds and on-shell renormalisability.
in these concluding section, i
comment on two other directions :

 friedans approach [11] :

friedan discusses renormalisation in the space of metrics, which, in the absence of
isometries, a priori leads to some unpredictiveness as a theory with an arbitrary metric
gij[] on the manifold m would involve an innite number of parameters.
if only a
nite number of them are physical ones, the theory is acceptable and may be called
a renormalisable theory. of course, the important part lies in the denition of what
are physical parameters. for instance, does a geometrical constraint (ricci atness,
hyperkahlerness,..) suciently reduce the space of parameters for a given manifold ? a
complete answer to that question is not known yet.

 the eective action point of view [36] :

the b.r.s. methods have been used in a series of papers [37] where it is claimed that
the goal of the physicists of the sixties [18] - that is to say the validity, to all orders
of perturbation theory, of the low energy theorems for non-linear  models, in d = 4
dimensions - has been reached. in another spirit, gomis and weinberg [36] note that,
given a standard renormalisable theory, the integration over some massive elds leads to
an action which is power counting non-renormalisable. however, they argue that such a
theory is physically predictive and then should be considered as renormalisable in an
extended sense. moreover they discuss the a priori constraints that should be imposed on
the form of the bare action to make possible the absorbtion of any innity coming from
loop graphs by an allowed counterterm. here also, more work is to be done.
