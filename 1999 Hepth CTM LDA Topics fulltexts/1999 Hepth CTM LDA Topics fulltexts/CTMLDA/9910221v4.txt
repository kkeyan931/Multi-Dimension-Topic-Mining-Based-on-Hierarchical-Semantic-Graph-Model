abstract

we introduce a model designed to describe charged particles as stable
topological solitons of a eld with values on the internal space s 3. these
solitons behave like particles with relativistic properties like lorentz con-
traction and velocity dependence of mass. this mass is dened by the
energy of the soliton. in this sense this model is a generalisation of the
sinegordon model1 from 1+1 dimensions to 3+1 dimensions, from s 1
to s 3. for large distances from the center of solitons this model tends
to a dual u (1)-theory with freely propagating electromagnetic waves. al-
ready at the classical level it describes important eects, which usually
have to be explained by quantum eld theory, like particle-antiparticle
annihilation and the running of the coupling.

1 introduction

the standard model of particle physics describes electromagnetic, weak and
strong interactions and includes three generations of fermions. up to now all
possible predictions of the standard model are in agreement with experiment.
nevertheless, in connection with the standard model there are still many inter-
esting questions which demand for further explanations. the deepest of them
may be the origin of mass, the experimental evidence for three generations of
fermions and of three types of interactions, strong, electro-weak and gravita-
tional forces. further there are a lot of interesting properties which by the
standard model are accounted for in a very abstract way. a prominent prob-
lem is the running of the couplings. the naivly formulated action turns out
to predict only useless innite numbers. a redenition of the theory is neces-
sary. in the renormalisation procedure it turns out that the theory can only
be formulated in a consistent way if the coupling constant varies with the
transfered momentum, a property which is reproduced very well in high en-
ergy experiments. in the standard model it is necessary to treat fermions with

morphism between the sinegordon model and the thirring model which was shown in 2
dimensional space-time.

special anticommuting numbers, with grassman variables, in order to account
for the pauli principle. the vacuum of quantum eld theory turns out to be a
most complicated state. the qcd vacuum, the vacuum of quantum chromo
dynamics, seems to account for the connement of colour charges only, if it has
the properties of a magnetic medium. in this sense quantum eld theory has
reintroduced the concept of ether in a form which is compatible with relativity.
there are further many well established and accepted eects which could ask
for some deeper understanding. to this group belong the well known relativistic
properties of particles, like the velocity dependence of mass, lorentz contraction
and time dilatation which are usually derived from the basic lorentz transfor-
mation properties and in this way not accessible to an intuitive understanding.
there are questions which occupy the mind of physicists since decades like
the einstein-rosen-podolsky paradox and the absence of magnetic monopoles.
from an extreme point of view one could compare the high level of abstaction
of theoretical physics with the epicycles in the ptolemaeic world system and hope
for a more intuitive explanation of physical phenomena.

there are some hints for the origin of the above mentioned problems. gauge
theories, the basic theories for the standard model, treat fundamental fermions
as point-like particles. the fermionic determinant in the path integral formu-
lation of quantum eld theory turns out to be a summation over all possible
pathes of these point-like fermions. the fermions interact with the gauge eld
only via the registration of a generalised phase of the gauge elds along these
pathes. a long standing puzzle in this connection is the so called fermion dou-
bling problem. it was proven by nielsen and nyonima [1] that it is not possible
to formulate fermionic elds in a discretised world with periodic boundary con-
ditions in a unique manner.

there is a simple 1+1dimensional model [2], the sinegordon model which
has a characteristic type of 2-kink solutions which are topological excitations.
they have many simple properties, which request a rather complicated treat-
ment within the standard model of particle physics. a chain of elastically con-
nected pendula on a horizontal mechanical transmission line is a simple me-
chanical model which in the continuum limit follows the sinegordon equation.
the properties of a moving kink give a very intuitive understanding of relativis-
tic properties. a kink-soliton can be accelerated by an increase of torsion and
therefore of energy stored in the kink. lorentz contraction and the velocity
dependence of the energy of the kink follow exactly the well-known formulae of
special relativity. the velocity of the kink is limited to the speed of the prop-
agation of small amplitude waves, i.e. the mechanical analog of the speed of
light. kinks and anti-kinks behave like positive and negative charges. equal
kinks repel and opposite kinks attract each other. kink-antikink pairs can an-
nihilate to two waves propagating in opposite directions. the repulsion of two
kinks is increasing with their relative velocity. the increase of the torsion of
kinks in a collision may appear as a simple analog of the running of the coupling
with the momentum transfer. two kinks can never be at the same place  a
behaviour requested by the pauli exclusion principle. these analogies between
sinegordon model and basic physical properties dont include the propagation

2

of waves. in the sinegordon model there are no free waves propagating with
the speed of light. the potential energy allows only for photons with a mass.
low amplitude waves follow a 1+1dimensional klein-gordon equation.

the analogies of the sinegordon model inspired skyrme in his hope for an
unied field theory of mesons and baryons [3]. it seems that the investigations
in this eld were restricted to the description of strongly interacting particles.
we will present in this article an application of similiar ideas to the descrip-
tion of electric charges, especially electrons, and electro-magnetic elds. the
3+1dimensional model presented in this article tries to generalize the appeal-
ing properties of the sinegordon model and includes further free propagating
waves.

2 formulation of the model

the fundamental idea of gauge theories is the existence of a local coordinate
system for the internal degrees of freedom like weak-isospin or colour and the
independence of all observations from the orientation of this system. one of
the basic ideas of our model is that gauge theories need only be reproduced at
large distances from charges. at short distances we want to generalize the sine
gordon model where one assigns to any point in 1+1dimensional space-time
a denite eld variable, a phase. according to the standard model of strong
and electro-weak interactions the most obvious internal (colour) degrees of
freedom seem to be an su (2)-eld for leptons and an su (3)-eld for hadrons.
in the following we will concentrate on su (2)-elds. it is essential for our model
that these elds can form topological solitons with the properties of monopoles.
to emphasize the strong relation between our model and dierential geom-
etry and in order to have a sound basis for a comparison of this model with the
skyrme model and gauge theories, we introduce in subsection 2.1 the concept
of local coordinate systems, connection and curvature. since we do not intend
to derive a lagrange density from another theory, in the further subsections
we are going to give arguments for the form of the lagrangian. this is cho-
sen in such a way that solitons with a coulomb eld are topologically stable.
readers familiar with dierential geometry and gauge theories are adviced to go
immediately to subsection 2.6 where the lagrange density is introduced which
is the mathematical starting point of the model and only then to have a look
at the hedgehog ansatz (27), the energy density for static soliton elds (41),
the non-linear dierential equation (42) and the discussion of its solutions in
sect.(2.4).

2.1 local coordinate systems and geometry

we want to generalise the 1+1dimensional sinegordon model with eld vari-
ables in s1 to a 3+1dimensional model with eld variables in s3, the three
dimensional sphere in four dimensions. we introduce in this subsection the
dierential geometry on s3. there are various possibilities to introduce an

3

algebra for this space. the simplest of them may be an su (2)-eld in the den-
ing representation and the oldest algebra is that of hamiltons quaternions [4].
quaternions are generalisations of complex numbers which contain a real part
and three imaginary parts with the corresponding units i, j and k, with the
non-commutative multiplication law i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = 1. it is well known
that the properties of these units are just the properties of paulis spin matrices
i = i1, j = i2, k = i3.

an su (2)-eld assigns to every point x = (ct, ~x) in space-time a unimodular

quaternionic number q(x) by

q = q0 + ikqk = (cid:18) q0 + iq3

q2 + iq1

q2 + iq1

q0  iq3 (cid:19) with |q2| := q2

0 + ~q2 = 1.

(1)

the condition q2

0 + ~q2 = 1 restricts the parameter-space of su (2)-matrices
to the unit-sphere s3 of r4. the unimodularity of su (2)-matrices shows up in
their exponential representation as a generalised phase-factor

q = ei~n~ with q0 = cos , qk = nk sin , ~n2 = 1.

(2)

the generalised phase ~n~ = nkk is a generalised imaginary part of a
quaternionic number, an element of the su(2)-algebra (in the dening represen-
tation).2

we can dene the scalar product of two quaternions p and q via the scalar

product of the corresponding vectors (q0, ~q) and (p0, ~p) in r4

p  q = q  p := q0p0 + ~q~p =

1

tr(qp ) =

tr(qp ).

(3)

along a path ~x(s) in space-time, parametrized by a parameter s, the eld
q(s) denes, as we will discuss below, a rotation of a local coordinate system
and may induce a curvature which we can relate to the electric eld strength.
the situation is analog to that on the curved surface of earth, which has the
topology of s2, of the usual sphere. at the north-pole we can dene a local two
dimensional coordinate system, e.g. by the 0 and 90 meridians and identify
them with the real unit 1 and the imaginary unit i. therefore, any vector in
the tangential plane of the north-pole can be represented by a complex number
w. a parallel transport of the coordinate system from the north-pole along
meridians, characterised by the azimutal angle , inherits the basic system to
arbitrary positions (, ) on earth. they are rotated by  with respect to the
direction of the meridians. a parallel transport of a twodimensional tangential
vector w from (, ) along an arbitrary big circle results in a change of its phase
by some . the vector-eld ~ which describes the continous rotation of the
local coordinate system depends on the direction d~s of movement, it is the eld
of connection coecients or christoel symbols

w d~s w = (1  id) w = (1  isds) w.

(4)

2we use the summation convention that any latin index that is repeated in a product is
automatically summed on from 1 to 3. the arrows on variables in the internal space indicate
the set of 3 elements ~q = (q1, q2, q3) or ~ = (1, 2, 3) and ~q~ = qkk.

4

for the above mentioned case of an su (2)-eld the parameter space is s3.
we can dene three orthogonal unit vectors at the north-pole with q = 1,
e.g. the three imaginary quaternionic units or 1, 2 and 3. the set of vectors
(su(2)-algebra elements) ~v~ = vkk builds the tangential space at the north-
pole. the product v = ~v~q is an element of the tangential space at q, since
its scalar product with q according to eq.(3) vanishes

v  q =

1
2

tr(v q) =

1

tr(~v~qq) =

vktrk = 0.

(5)

therefore, by its action on k, q inherits a local coordinate system kq to each
position on s3 and also to any point in coordinate-space r3.

(10)

where we again use the vector symbol for vectors in the tangential space q

with q(s) = cos (s) + i~~n(s) sin (s) and

(sq) q = i~n ~n + sin  cos  ~n  sin2  ~n  ~no = i~~s

we get

~s = ~n + sin  cos  ~n  sin2  ~n  ~n,

(11)

(12)

3the choice of the basis vectors does not inuence the relations between physical objects.
using the left adjoint basis q
:= qk instead of the right adjoint basis kq would be
k
completely equivalent and would lead to the same coordinate independent nal results. gauge
dependent quantities like the connection ~s would of course look slightly dierent

s =  ~n  sin  cos  ~n  sin2  ~n  ~n,

as it is shown in sec. 3.

where the dot represents the derivative with respect to s.4 the derivatives of
the basis vectors q
k at q along some path parametrised by s have components
in the tangential plane at q, i.e. along q
k , and a component in radial direction
q. these components can be found multiplying eq. (10) from the left with k
and using

(~~a) (~~b) = ~a~b + i~~a  ~b.

we get

l + iskq = isklq

or in matrix notation

s~q = is~q + i~sq.

(13)

(14)

(15)

in dierential geometry the equivalent formulae are known as the formulae of
gau/ss [5]. the connection matrix s describes the (passive) rotation of the
unit vectors of the local coordinate system in internal space along the curve
parametrised by s

(s)kl = skl = (tj)kl sj

with

(tj)kl = ijkl.

(16)

tj are the generators in the (adjoint) t = 1representation of su (2) with

[tj, tk] = ijkltl,

t 
j = tj,

tr (tjtk) = 2jk.

(17)

for the understanding of the matrix elements of s in addition to eq. (16) we
give the relations

sj =

tr(tjs),

~s =

tr( ~t s)

(18)

(19)

4in gauge theories expression like (sq) q appearing in eqs.(10) and (11) are usually
associated with trivial connections and zero curvature. in this respect we would like to re-
mind that the concepts of connection elds and curvature go back to dierential geometry
of curved spaces by carl friedrich gau/ss. our elds are dened on the unit sphere s 3,
whose gaussian curvature is obviously one. the curvature tensor in dierential geometry is
designed to measure areas on curved surfaces. therefore, it seems rather natural to allow for
non-vanishing curvature tensors for elds dwelling on unit spheres. in our notation the trivial
connection would read 2~s. the factor 2 appears due to the fact that the su (2) generators
in the fundamental representation are k/2, whereas in eq. (11) there appears only k. it
is easy to check that for the trivial connection ~
s = 2~s the maurer-cartan equation (24)
looks like a vanishing curvature tensor (22).

(20)

r measures the area ~s  ~t in internal space
rstkm = i (sktm  tksm) = ilkmlijsitj = (tl)km(cid:16)~s  ~t(cid:17)l

. (21)

in dierential geometry r is called the riemann-christoel curvature tensor.

in agreement with the theorema egregium of carl friedrich gau/ss eq. (21)
relates the area ~s ~t with the connection  and its derivatives. the step from
dierential geometry to physics is done by interpreting the curvature tensor r
as a eld in fourdimensional space-time. two indices (s, t) of r are related to
the coordinate space and two indices (k, m) to the internal (colour) space. r
has these properties in common with the eld strength tensor f in non-abelian
gauge theories. up to a sign convention the relation of f to the gauge eld a
is identical to the relation between r and . it reads in matrix notation

rst = st + ts + i [s, t] .

due to eqs. (16) and (17) we get

~t (cid:16)~s  ~t(cid:17) = i [s, t] .

from eqs. (20) and (21) there follows the very important relation

st  ts = 2i [s, t] .

after removal of the generators ~t it reads

s~t  t~s = 2~s  ~t.

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

this equation is well-known under the name maurer-cartan structural equa-
tion. it is the necessary and sucient condition that the su (2)-eld q can be
reconstructed from the vector eld s [3]. it follows also from the q-components
of eq.(19).

due to eqs. (22)-(25) we have now several useful expressions for the area

rst ds dt in internal space

rst ds dt = ~t (cid:16)~s  ~t(cid:17) ds dt = (st + ts + i [s, t]) ds dt =

(26)

= i [s, t] ds dt = 

(st  ts) ds dt.

after deriving connection and curvature in agreement with dierential ge-
ometry we are now going to relate them to vector potential and eld strength
and introduce step by step the various terms in the hamiltonian, designed to

7

describe particles with a coulomb eld as solitons stabilized by their topological
properties. since we would like to use this hamiltonian or the corresponding la-
grangian as the starting point of our model there is no way to derive them. the
only justication of these terms is the predictive power and the simplicity of the
model. readers which do not like such pedagogical introductions and prefer to
start from a dening lagrangian and to derive immediately all properties from
it are adviced to switch to subsection 2.6 where the dening lagrangian of the
model is given. in subsection 2.2 we introduce the electric eld and its energy.
by adding a potential energy we get in subsection 2.3 the total energy of static
eld congurations. the variation of the prole function of hedgehog solutions
leads to a non-linear dierential equation for stable soliton congurations. we
are able to solve this equation for a special case analytically in subsection 2.4.
further solutions of the variational problem we investigate numerically. after
introducing the magnetic eld and solitons moving with constant velocity in
subsection 2.5 we arrive at the space-time formulation in subsection 2.6.

2.2 the electric monopole

for the description of electric charges we want to take advantage of the topology
of s3 using the well-known hedgehog ansatz

q = cos  + i nkk sin , with  = (r),

~n =

~r
r

(27)

for the su (2)-eld q of eq.(2), which we would like to call the soliton-eld. the
parameter space of su (2) is s3, the unit sphere in four dimensions. the basic
idea is to describe charged particles by eld congurations which cover only
1/2 of s3. in s3 such eld congurations
an odd number nw of hemispheres s3
have an open boundary s2
int, a unit sphere in three dimensions, dened by
q0 = 0, qk = nk. this sphere in internal space is related to the innite far sphere
 in coordinate space by ~q = ~n = ~r
s2
r . by this construction we expect forces of
innite range between such particles. for an even number nw of coverings, s2

is related to a single element in parameter space. we anticipate forces of nite
range only.

we get regular hedgehog elds (27) for

(0) = n0,

() = (0) +

nw

2

,

and expect

nw    odd
nw    even

charged eld conguration,

uncharged eld conguration.

(28)

(29)

(30)

without loss of generality we can put n0 = 0.

we aim now to relate the dierential geometrical concepts of subsection 2.1
to physics and apply them to the hedgehog ansatz. we follow the concept of

8

gauge theories and relate vector potential to connection and eld strength to
curvature.

in spherical coordinates the connections rdr, d and d correspond
to translations by dr, rd and r sin d. therefore, we introduce the dierential
line elements

lr dr = dr,

l d = r d,

l d = r sin  d

(31)

and identify up to a measure system dependent constant the curvature r of
eq. (26) with the electric ux through the corresponding area in space. since
we would like to formulate a model for the most elementary charge, the electron,
we write

er = 

e0

40

r
ll

, e = 

e0

40

rr

, e =

(32)

where the constant is adjustet to the charge e0 of the electron and the inter-
national measure system (si). the connection  we related correspondingly to
the dual gauge eld c by line elements

cr = 

e0

40

r
lr

, c = 

e0

40


l

(33)

according eq.(12) using the hedgehog ansatz (27) we get the connection

~r = (r) ~er,
~ = sin  [cos  ~e  sin  ~e] = sin  ~e,
~ = sin  sin  [sin  ~e + cos  ~e] = sin  sin  ~e,

(34)

where ~er, ~e, ~e and ~e = cos  ~e  sin  ~e, ~e = sin  ~e + cos  ~e are the
corresponding unit vectors and the prime indicates derivatives with respect to
r.

the electric eld strength which is dened up to the measure dependent
constant as the ratio of the area r in internal space to the corresponding area
in physical space reads with eq. (26)

er = 

e =

these expressions correspond to the eld strength tensors in dual non-

behaviour at large distances is dominated by the curvature component r. in

(36)

and is given by the charge of the electron in agreement with gau/sss law.

in the skyrme model, which in our notation treats only even winding num-
bers nw, the eld strength vanishes faster than 1/r2 at spatial innity. in that
model it is common to use another denition of the eld strength. it reads in
our notation5

fst  st  ts  2i [s, t] = 0.

(37)

this expression vanishes due the maurer-cartan equation (24), see e.g. eq.
(1.34) of ref. [3]. since this eld strength is zero, this denition would suppress
the observation of the electric eld produced by a soliton at large distances.
in this case the soliton could not be interpreted as a physical electron whose
electric eld behaves like a coulomb eld. that is why in our case the eld
strength and the curvature related to it should be dened in a way which is
asymptotically compatible with the eld strength of an electromagnetic eld at
large distances.

in this case at r   only the radial part of the electric eld should survive,
and the observer should feel only the coulomblike eld of an electric charge.
therewith the observer would not be able to distinguish whether this eld is
produced by a pointlike particle or an extended topological object. since ex-
perimentally our topological object should be detected by virtue of its electric
charge we prefer to call this topological object an electron.

in the skyrme model, see e.g.

[3], the energy contribution (38) is called
the skyrme term. it is very well known that the skyrme term is not able to

10

stabilize a topological eld conguration. this can be concluded from a simple
scaling argument. lets start from an arbitrary eld conguration with energy
e = he and make a scale transformation by a factor  > 1, it follows, the
energy decreases by a factor 1/ and the minimisation of the integral in (39)
leads to an unbounded increase of the size of the object.

2.3 stabilization of the monopole solution

in order to stabilize the solution (29) we have to add a term which scales under
transformations ~r  ~r with a positive power of . if we used a mass term
for the vector elds c we would arrive at the skyrme model which has only
topological stable solutions of type (30).

the potential term which we look for should vanish for  = (2n + 1)/2
and should be an even function of q0 = cos . we will discuss in the following
potential energy densities of the form

hp =

cos2m , m = 1, 2, 3,    ,

(40)

where by dimensional arguments we had to introduce a fundamental length
parameter r0. such potential terms scale with 3 and keep the topological
soliton together like the potential energy term in our onedimensional analogon,
the sinegordon model.

with this assumption the total energy functional reads in scaled coordinates

 = r

h = he + hp =

d(cid:20) sin4 

22 + ( cos )2 + 2 cos2m (cid:21) .

(41)

which besides the power m contains a single free parameter, a fundamental
length scale r0. another possibility would be to use cot2  in the potential
energy density.

all contributions to the static energy (41) are positive. the energy is there-
fore bounded from below by the energy of trivial eld congurations with
q =const. and q0 = cos  = 0. every topological sector, characterised by
its winding number nw which was dened in eq. (28), has its own minimal
conguration. there is a simple reason for the stability of non-trivial eld con-
gurations, the competition between two terms in the energy with dierent scale
dependence. the energy density of the electric eld tries to diminish the curva-
ture of the eld conguration and therefore to enlarge the region of space with
cos  6= 0. on the other hand the potential energy aims at compressing the eld
conguration.

the existence of stable eld congurations follows from the solution of the
variational problem. variation with respect to cos () in eq. (41) leads to a
non-linear second order dierential equation

with the boundary condition (28) for the hedgehog ansatz (27). some of the
solutions of (42) we will discuss in the next subsection.

stabilization is a common problem for models of topological objects. for
the stabilization of the topological solution in the georgi-glashow model [6],
based on a triplet of scalar higgs elds and the so(3)-gauge group, t hooft
and polyakov [7] used a higgs-potential. of course, due to the consideration of
classical solutions of equations of motion they could have used any potential for
scalar elds leading to the higgs mechanism providing the appearence of non-
zero masses of gauge elds in the spontaneously broken phase. the standard
form of the higgs-potential for the stabilization of the soliton is imposed by the
requirement of renormalisability. if one is not restricted by the requirement of
renormalisability, that is just the case of our approach, the stabilizing potential
can be any one [8]. another important point distinguishing our approach and
that of t hooftpolyakov is in the denition of the eld strength.
in the t
hooftpolyakov approach the higgs eld is used as a lens projecting the non-
abelian eld strength onto the electromagnetic one. in our case such a projection
runs automatically through the steep fall-o of the transversal components of
the electric eld of the topological electron at large distances. concerning the
renormalisability of the model preliminary results obtained for the hamiltonian
induced by quantum uctuations around static topologigal solitons in the hedge-
hog ansatz (27) have shown the appearance of only trivial divergencies which
can be absorbed in the normalisation factor of the partition function [9].

2.4 discussion of monopole solutions

in eq.(41) we gave the energy of a static eld conguration of hedgehog type
(27). we have shown that the minimisation of this energy leads to the non-linear
dierential equation (42). for m = 3 we can give the lowest energy solution
(nw = 1) of this minimisation problem in analytical form

there are further solutions of eq. (42) with higher winding numbers nw,
these can be determined numerically by minimising the energy functional (41).
the prole function (r) and the three contributions to the radial energy den-
sities h for the numerical solutions to the winding numbers nw = 3 and 5 for a
potential energy term with power m = 3 are also shown in fig. 1.

for these solutions we get the following energy ratios

increasing the power m of the potential term (40) one gets higher ratios. the
results for some powers are shown in fig. 2. they are again determined by
numerical minimisation of the action functional (41). the indicated errors are
the energy dierences which result from a doubling of the integration intervals.
as we will discuss in more detail in sect. 4 nw is a topological quantum num-
ber which is conserved in transitions. increasing the power m the mass ratios
increase with an increasing power of nw and may even reach the experimental
mass ratios 1 : 207 : 3477 of electron, muon and tauon around m  350. there
is a certain freedom in the choice of the potential energy term (40). but more
detailed investigations are needed in order to study all consequences of various
choices of the potential.

the stable soliton solutions show an interesting relation between the con-
tributions of the potential and the electric energy to the total energy. this
relation can even be used in numerical calculations to test the accuracy of the
approximation. in the next section we treat the relativistic behaviour of the
solitons. it will turn out that this relation is a necessary condition for the rel-
ativistic behaviour of the solitons of our theory. one can easily show that this
type of virial theorem is guaranteed by the functional form of the energy ex-
pression, it is well-known in skyrme-models under the name of hobart-derrick
necessity condition [3]. let us follow this important argument and return to
the scale transformations which we mentioned in connection with the stability
of solitons. we have found that against such scale transformations x  x the
electric energy behaves like 1
 and the potential energy like 3. for a stable
solution the derivative of the energy (41) with respect to  has to vanish

for.

2.5 particle properties of solitons

one of the nice features of the sinegordon model is the relativistic behaviour
of its solitons. to gain insight into the corpuscular nature of the solitions of this
model we introduce the speed of light c and investigate a conguration moving
with a constant velocity  = v/c in z-direction

qv(x) = cos (|~r  ~vt|) + i ~

~r  ~vt
|~r  ~vt|

sin (|~r  ~vt|),

(49)

in fourdimensional space-time x = (ct, ~x). for the vector-eld  of connection-
coecients we dene an additional time component ( = 0)

 = ~t ~ = ~t

1
2i

tr(cid:8)~ (q) q(cid:9) .

(50)

this allows to introduce a curvature in space-time directions and the corre-
sponding physical quantity, the magnetic induction ~b

cbk :=

e0

40

(0k  k0  i [0, k]) .

(51)

in addition to the static contribution to the energy density of the moving soliton
we therefore expect dynamic, magnetic contributions

h := t + v, v := he + hp,

t := hm,

he :=

trc2 ~b2, hp :=

(52)

.

in all dynamical systems with a competition between static and dynamic
degrees of freedom, allowing for an oscillatory behaviour, one has to search for
solutions where variations of the static part are compensated by variations of
the dynamic part and therefore the sum of both contributions is a constant of
motion and the dierence an extremum. this requirement is the basis for the
lagrangian formalism, where one looks for an extremum of the action

s := z d4xl, l := t  v.

due to the special t-dependence in eq. (49) we get

0 = z, 0 = z.

and the relations

cbx = ey,

cby = ex,

cbz = 0.

(53)

(54)

(55)

follow immediately. these equations are well known from special relativity for
the relation between electric and magnetic elds in a reference frame moving
with velocity v in negative z-direction with respect to a static charge. here,

15

they follow from the assumption that the soliton doesnt change its shape with
time.

moving sinegordon solitons are compressed relative to the static congu-
rations as requested by their relativistic behaviour. to nd an analogous be-
haviour of our solitons we transform the coordinates ~x of the laboratory system

to uncontracted comoving coordinates


~x


z = (z  vt),


x,


y = x, y,

(56)

with a scale factor  which we can x by the above mentioned variational prin-
ciple. according to (49) and (50) this transformation implies

the rst two of these conditions are fullled due to the symmetry of the so-
lution of the minimisation problem in the comoving frame. the last one is a
consequence of the derrick-hobart necessity condition, as discussed at the end
of sect. 2.4.

this discussion shows that it is possible to understand the relativistic be-
haviour of particles, e.g. lorentz contraction and velocity dependence of mass,

16

on a microsopic basis through the dynamics of the soliton eld. lorentz con-
traction turns out to be a consequence of the necessity to accelerate the soliton
eld. additional electric curvature energy of q is needed for this acceleration
process which can be transformed locally in magnetic (dynamic) energy. both
parts contribute to the relativistic energy of the moving particle

2.6 fourdimensional formulation

in subsections 2.2 - 2.5 we gave a motivation for the choice of the eld variables
q and the lagrangian of our model. to every point x in space-time we assign
an su (2)-eld, which can be identied with a unimodular quaternionic number.
we want to take advantage of the topolgy of the parameter space s3 of q, the
unit sphere in four dimensions. an easy way to work with these eld variables
is to use the fundamental representation of su (2) with pauli-matrices ~

q(x) = ei(x)~n(x)~ = q0(x) + ikqk(x),

q0 = cos , qk = nk sin , ~n2 = 1, 0   

the lagrangian

consists of a conventional part

l = ldual  hp

ldual =

(64)

(65)

and a potential term

the form of ldual and of the curvature tensor

r =  +   + i [, ]

(67)

is in full agreement with dual non-abelian su (2) gauge theory.
in analogy
to this theory we call therefore the internal space the colour space. the dual

17

this agreement can also be nicely seen expressing the lagrangian (64) in terms

furthermore, due to

r = i[, ] = (~  ~ ) ~t = ~r ~t

(70)

ldual is identical to the skyrme term in the skyrme model. the agreement
between expressions (67) and (70) is caused by the maurer-cartan equation
(24) and leads to an expression for the curvature tensor in terms of the rotor of
the connection eld

~r = 

1
2

(~  ~).

(71)

the maurer-cartan equation (24) garantues that the soliton eld q can be
reconstructed from the connection

 = ~ ~t , k = i tr (q q k
2

).

in the variables  and ~n of eq. (63) the connection reads

~ =  ~n + sin  cos  ~n  sin2  ~n  ~n,

(72)

(73)

~n, ~n and ~n  ~n form an orthogonal dreibein for ~. the square of the
curvature in the lagrangian (64) turns out to be a function of q0 = cos  and
the derivatives q0 and ~n

(74)

ldual tends to decrease the curvature of the soliton eld q by increasing
the size of solitons. the potential term hp on the other hand tries to diminish
regions where trq is non-zero and to shrink solitons, therfore reducing the
eective parameter space from s3 to s2 in space regions as large as possible.

18

we have discussed in sect. 2.3 that this competition between the curvature
term ldual and the potential term hp leads to a variational problem for stable
hedgehog solutions. the existence of non-trivial solutions we have shown in
sect. 2.4 by giving special examples. these solitonic solutions are characterised
by a topological quantum number, the winding number nw. we will demon-
strate in sec. 3 that this model has a further topological quantum number, the
electric charge. in sec. 4 we will show that the winding number agrees with
the topological charge in its standard form. since these topological quantum
numbers are conserved independent of any dynamics they guarantee that the
solitons survive scattering processes.

3 gauge transformations and u (1)-gauge theory

with the lagrangian (64) we succeeded to formulate a theory for topological
solitons with a coulomb eld. let us now investigate the relation of the su (2)-
eld to the u (1)-eld of charges in maxwells theory. according to the electro-
weak model one could think of a u (1)  su (2)-structure of these degrees of
freedom. but due to the cartesian product there are no special solitons which
could be introduced by an additional u (1)-eld and there is no simple possibility
to transfer eld strength from su (2) to u (1)-degrees of freedom. it turns out
that this relation can be formulated in a much simpler way. at large distances
from the center of a charged soliton the potential term hp restricts the eld
degrees of freedom to an s2-sphere, to the sphere s2

int with

q0 = 0  q2

1 + q2

2 + q2

3 = 1

for

r  .

(75)

in this region the potential term can be neglected and the remaining degrees of
freedom are the ~n-elds which appear in the expression (74) for the square
of the curvature. they dwell in the tangential spaces of the sphere s2
int. on
this sphere we can choose the local coordinate systems arbitrarily. therefore,
we arrive at a dual-u (1)-gauge theory. as we suggested in subsection 2.1 on
the north-pole of this sphere we can identify the unit vectors in  = 0 and 90-
directions with the real unit 1 and the imaginary unit i. a parallel transport of
this coordinate system along the meridians  = const. inherits a local coordinate
system to any position (, ) of s2
int. the connection coecients can easily be
derived. we have obviously

 = 0.

(76)

a parallel transport of a vector along a parallel of latitude by the angle d leads
to a (passive) rotation of the coordinate system by d. this value we have to
decrease by the angle d cos  for the rotation of the osculating great circle and
get for the connection

d = (1  cos )d.

(77)

19

if we take into account the spherical symmetry ( = ,  = ) of the soliton,
multiply with the charge factor  e0
and divide by the corresponding distance
40
l d = r sin  d we get the dual vector potential

c = 0, c = 

e0



40

r sin

1  cos 

40

r sin 

.

(78)

the dual vector-potential forms circles around the z-axis and is singular for
 = . this potential is characteristic of a dual dirac monopole, of an electric
monopole of charge e0, with a singularity of the u (1)-potential along the
negative z-axis. its electric eld strength is given by

~e = ~  ~c = 

e0

40

~er
r2

(79)

a formulation of electrodynamics in terms of dual potentials was given in
ref.[10].

in the following we will see that such a vector-potential we can also get by
a gauge-transformation of the connection eld (34) which in the limit of large
radial distances reads

r = 0,  =  ~t ~e,  = sin  ~t~e,

for

r  .

(80)

we have seen in eqs. (5) and (8) that the vectors q

k = kq form an or-
thonormal basis in the tangential space at q. a gauge transformation is nothing
else than a rotation of this basis in the tangential space with some su (2)-matrix

we insert the transformation ~q = ~q in eq. (15) and multiply from the

left with  and get

s~q = i  (s + is) ~q + i ~sq = i

sq.

(84)

20

by comparing to eq. (15) we read o that the  in the tangential direction (the
connection) transforms dierently

s  

s =  (s + is) 

from that in the radial direction

sk = sk  

sk = klsl,

(85)

(86)

which transforms like a vector. therefore, the maurer-cartan equation (24) is
preserved for constant  only, i.e. for global gauge transformations.

a special gauge transformation is the transformation from the right adjoint
k := qk by  = q in
s in the left adjoint basis we can read from eq. (85)

k := kq of eq. (6) to the left adjoint basis q

basis q
eq. (81). the connection

if we specify  = ei


2 or equivalently

 = eit = 1 + i sin  t + (cos  1) t 2
,

we get from (80) and (85) after some calculation


r = 0, 

 = 0, 

 = (cos   1) t3.

(87)

(88)

(89)

(90)

this result agrees with eq. (77). therefore, our soliton at large distances
behaves like a dual dirac monopole. the dirac string of the u (1)-formulation
appears as a consequence of the the internal su (2)-structure of the monopole.
at large distances the soliton eld of the monopole dwells at s2

int

q(x)  i~

~r

~(x)  ~n  ~n.

(91)

the hedgehog eld is completly regular, but turning all internal direction vectors
~n in z-direction leads to a singularity of the u (1) eld, to the dirac string.

the u (1) structure of solitons at large distances has interesting consequences.
solitons behave like electric charges. positive and negative charges add like in-
teger numbers. solitons feel coulomb- and lorentz-forces.

at large distances from an ensemble of solitons and antisolitons we have
to full the condition (75). this denes a mapping of the internal s2
int to
the innite far sphere s2
 in coordinate space. it is well-known from topology
that such non-singular mappings can be classied into homotopy classes. these

21

homotopy classes form a group which in our case is isomorphic to the group of
integers and can be written in the compact form [11]

2(s2) = z.

(92)

we conclude, due to their topological origin all electric charges are integer mul-
tiples of the unit charge e0.

we get from eq. (73)

is(u,v)

dudv (~u  ~v) ~n = is(u,v)

dudv (u~n  v~n) ~n sin2 .

(93)

this integral may take arbitrary values as long as sin2  is arbitrary. regions
with cos  6= 0 are suppressed by the potential energy (66) in the lagrangian.
a region with cos  6= 0 can in general decay in excitations with cos  = 0, i.e.
in abelian excitations. this means that such a region radiates a conventional
electro-magnetic eld. this happens especially in the annihilation process of a
soliton with an antisoliton. we conclude that regions with cos  6= 0 survive in
soliton cores only. if a surface s(u, v) does not cross such soliton cores we get

i s(u,v)

cos =0

dudv ruv = i s(u,v)

cos =0

dudv (u~n  v~n) ~t .

(94)

since the cross-products of two tangential vectors of s2
tion ~n, the integral

int points in radial direc-

i s(u,v)

cos =0

dudv

1
2

tr[ruvtn] = i s(u,v)

cos =0

dudv (u~n  v~n)~n = 4z

(95)

adds up all the area elements u~n  v~n dudv of s2
int and counts the number z
of its coverings, as we discussed above. therefore, we dene the electric charge
by

ze0 = 

e0

8 i s(u,v)

cos =0

dudv tr[ruvtn].

(96)

by topological reasons there are no partial coverings of s2

int possible. there-
fore, the soliton model can only describe integer charges, the electric charge is
quantised. that is a dierence to normal electrodynamics which can describe
all sizes of charges. a u (1) path integral over gauge degrees of freedom contains
many unphysical states which do not fulll gau/sss law. to take into account
physical states only one has to construct a projection operator which projects
on states fullling gau/sss law[12].

corresponding eq. (74) in the lagrangian outside of soliton cores there enter

only derivatives of the soliton eld

1
2

trr r  (~n  ~n)2 .

(97)

therefore, any change of the local coordinate system (84) is allowed. this leads
to the lagrangian of a dual u (1) gauge theory with integer multiples of the
elementary charge only.

22

4 topological charge

we can interpret the soliton eld as a parametrisation of the internal space
with external coordinates x, y, z or r, , .
if we move in space by a line
element ls ds we move in colour space by a line element ~sds. obviously, the
vectors ~r, ~, ~ form a (non orthonormal) coordinate system at the point q
in internal space. the volume element in internal space corresponding to the
volume element lrdr ld ld = dr rd r sin d is therefore

~r(~  ~) drdd.

(98)

integrating over this volume element we can dene a topological charge q count-

since the topological charge q agrees with the winding number nw it char-
acterises static solutions. furthermore, as we will now discuss, any dynamic
nite energy conguration can be characterised by the number q of coverings
of hemispheres s3
1/2. as we discussed in sec. 3 due the potential term hp in the
lagrangian (64) a dynamic eld conguration has to converge for r   to a
u (1) eld conguration characterised by the electric charge ze0, the number z
of coverings of s2
int, of the sphere with q0 = cos  = 0, as dened in eq. (92).
for nite energy congurations the space region with q0 6= 0 must be nite.
due to the curvature term ldual = hm  he in the lagrangian neither z nor
q can be changed by any dynamics. z and q are therefore invariant under any
scattering process.

in the following we will prove the time independence of the topological charge
q in an analytical consideration. for simplicity we work in cartesian coordinates
with l = 1. we introduce the topological current according eq. (100)

k =

1
62 ~ (~  ~),

(102)

23

with the 4dimensional antisymmetric tensor 0123 = 1230 = 1. in terms of
the time-component of the topological current the topological charge reads

q(t) = z d3rk0(x).

(103)

with tr [abc] = 2iabc, eq.(10) and qq + qq = 0 the topological

current can be represented in an equivalent form

k =

1
62 ~(~  ~) =
1
122 tr[qqqqqq] =

=

1
122 tr[(i~~)(i~~)(i~~)] =

1

122 tr(cid:2)qqqq(cid:3) .

(104)

which agrees completely with topological currents introduced in instanton physics
[13] and the skyrme model [3].

the topological current (104) is obviously conserved

k =

=

1

722 tr(cid:2)qqqq(cid:3) =
722 tr(cid:2)qq qqqqqq(cid:3) = 0.

1

(105)

the r.h.s of this equation is zero due to the symmetry properties of the trace
and the tensor . this entails the conservation of the topological charge

dq(t)

dt

= z d3r


t

k0(x) = cz d3r k(x) = 0,

(106)

if no soliton is allowed to leave the system. this implies that the stabilizing po-
tential energy has great inuence on the conservation of the topological charge.
in fact, due to the stabilizing potential hp the solution of the classical equations
of motion acquires the shape of a localised soliton with the spatial current ~k,
the spatial part of a topological current, vanishing at r   steeper than 1/r2.
this has allowed to use

z d3r div ~k(x) = is 2



d~s ~k(x) = 0

(107)

for the derivation of eq. (106).

there is an interesting consequence of the conservation of the topological
charge. we can conclude that f f vanishes identically: this follows with
eq.(10) from the conservation (105)

0 = tr(cid:2)qq qqqqqq(cid:3) =
= tr[(i~~)(i~~)(i~~)(i~~)] =
= 2 (~  ~)(~  ~) = tr[r r]  tr[f  f ],

(109)

this vanishing of f f is identical to the statements that electric eld strengh ~e
and magnetic eld strengh ~b are everywhere in space-time orthogonal to each
other and that there is no anomaly.

another interesting property which follows from the identication of the
eld-strenght tensor with the curvature of the soliton eld is the conservation of
electric ux. this is the dual bianchi identity. it can be derived from eqs. (67)
and (70)

 r = (~  ~) ~t = 

1
2

(  ) = 0

(110)

and the symmetry of double derivatives. therefore, the non-abelian electric
current

el =  ~f  = 0
~j

(111)

vanishes identically. from the vanishing of the non-abelian electric charge fol-
lows that there are no sources for a non-abelian electric eld and the non-abelian
electric ux-lines are closed

i ~ei = iijkj ~ck = 0.

(112)

this does not mean that the abelian electric ux through such closed surfaces

is vanishing, as we discussed at the end of sect. 3.

5 equations of motion

another interesting insight in the model we get from the equation of motion.
in sect. 2.3 we discussed the variational problem for the hedgehog ansatz (27)
which leads to the non-linear dierential equation (42). now we are going to
investigate the general variatonal problem of our model.

we vary the soliton eld q(x) by q in the tangential plane at q

q = i ~ ~ q

(113)

and get the quantities

~ = i tr (q q ~
2

),

q0 =

1
2

tr q =  ~ ~q

(114)

25

and from (72) follows the variation of the connection eld

~ = tr (q q ~
2i

= tr ([q q, q q]

) + tr (q q ~
2i
~
)  tr (q q ~
2i
2i

) =

)  =  ~   2 ~  ~.

(115)

the variation of the curvature term of the lagrangian (64) reads

[

1
4

~r ~r ] = ~[~  ~r] = ~ [~  ~r ],

(116)

and that of the potential term (66)

 =

d
dq0

q0 = ~ ~q

d
dq0

.

since the variation ~ is arbitrary the equation of motion follows

[~  ~r] + ~q

d
dq0

= 0.

from this equation we read that there is a current

~j  = ~  ~r

(117)

(118)

(119)

which is conserved in regions of vanishing potential energy hp, i.e. outside of
soliton cores. soliton cores are a source of this current

 ~j  = ~q

d
dq0

.

(120)

in a static soliton only the space components of ~ and ~r are non-vanishing.
therefore, the time-component of ~j vanishes identically. this leads to the
interpretation that ~j is a stationary magnetic current inside the soliton and the
origin of its static electric eld.

in physical units this magnetic current reads

~j =

e0c
2

~j .

(121)

with his help and the relation (68) between f and ~r we get a very simple
form for the lagrange density (64)

l = 

1
8

~c~j  hp.

(122)

there is another nice interpretation of the equation of motion (118). with

expression (71) for the curvature and using ~r  ~r = 0 we conclude

~   ~r + ~q

d
dq0

= 0.

(123)

26

this equation suggests to introduce the obviously conserved non-abelian mag-
netic current

~j
mag = 

~f  ,

~j

mag = 0.

(124)

according to the equation of motion in regions of vanishing potential energy hp
mag and the dual vector potential ~c have
the non-abelian magnetic current ~j
the same direction in colour space. inside of solitons there is also a transversal
colour component

6 energymomentum tensor

in this section we derive the explicit expression for the energymomentum ten-
sor (x). with (74) and (66) we write the lagrangian (64) in the form

the expression we get

(129)

we would like to emphasize that in classical electrodynamics [14] the energy
momentum tensor should be specially symmetrised.

now we consider the various components of the energymomentum tensor
 and express them in terms of electric and magnetic elds (68). 0

these equations generalize the expressions for the energy-momentum tensor

and internal su (2) degrees of freedom.

7 relativistic mechanics of a topological elec-

tron

from the energymomentum tensor 
(x) of sect. 6 we are now going to derive
the 4momentum of a topological electron. like in sect. 2.5 we treat a soliton
moving in the laboratory system with constant velocity ~ = ~v/c. the three-
dimensional space in the comoving frame is characterised by its normal






(x) = (1, 0, 0, 0)

(133)

in fourdimensional minkowski space. in the laboratory sytem  (x) has the
components

 (x) = (,  ~ ).

(134)

with the invariant 3volume element d3 
4vector

r in the comoving frame we dene the

d (x) = (x) d3
r

and the 4momentum

p  =

c z 

 (x) d3
r .

(135)

(136)

inserting eqs. (130-132) we get the components of the momentum 4vector in
terms of electric and magnetic elds

for congurations static in the comoving reference frame we derived in eq. (55)
a relation between the magnetic and the electric eld which we can write in
more general form

~bi(x) = ijkj ~ek(x).

inserting this equation in eq. (137) we get

p 0 = 

p i = i

(138)

(139)

since the lagrange density is a lorentz scalar we can evaluate it in the comoving
coordinate system. there it is equal to the negative value of the hamiltonian
density

p 0 =

(140)

these formulae conrm that a topological electron moving with velocity c ~
respects the relation between the energy p 0 =  m0c2 and the 3momentum
p i = i  m0c of a classical particle

pp  = m2

0c2.

(141)

this shows that solitons, topological stable objects, behave like classical
particles and can scatter at each other. in the next section we are going to show
that the interaction of these solitons with external electric and magnetic elds
follows newtons equation of motion. solitons experience coulomb and lorentz
forces.

8 interaction with external elds

the forces acting at solitons follow from the divergence of the energymomentum
tensor (129) which is the vector f of the force density

f = 

 = 

f hc
4

{~ [~  (~  ~)] +

(142)

+ ~ [~  (~  ~)]  ~[~  (~  ~)]  }.

after inserting the denition (119) of the current ~j  we get

f = 

f hc
4

{~ ~j  + ~ ~j   ~ ~j   }

(143)

29

and with the curvature tensor in terms of a rotor (71)

f = 

f hc
4

{2 ~r ~j  + ~  ~j    }.

(144)

we are now going to show that this expression vanishes for a closed system. its
rst term is zero

~r ~j  = (~  ~)[~  ~r] = (~~)(~ ~r)  (~~)(~ ~r) = 0

(145)

due to the orthogonality of ~ and ~r and due to the contraction of the
antisymmetric tensor ~r with the symmetric tensor ~~. the second term
~ ~j  of eq. (144) agrees with the third term   due to the equation of
motion (120)

~  ~j  = ~~q

d
dq0

=  sin 

d
dq0

= q0

d
dq0

=  .

(146)

we conclude that the force density for a closed system vanishes everywhere,

f = 0.

(147)

in order to describe the inuence of external elds we have to decompose
them from internal elds which have their origin in the internal current ~j .
this is only approximately possible. since ~j  is not related to an external eld
~rext

 the term (145) is not vanishing and leads to an external force

f ext

 = 

f hc

2 z d3r ~rext



~j  = z ~f ext

 d3r~j.

(148)

this external force describes the interaction of a charge distribution with ex-
ternal electromagnetic elds and has a form which resembles the well-known
coulomb and lorentz forces. but the realisation of these forces is dual to that
in electrodynamics. as one can immediately see from eqs. (119) and (121)
a static soliton is characterised by a vanishing time component ~j0 and non-
vanishing space-components ~ji. this spatial current interacts with the external
electric eld which is represented by a curvature of the soliton eld created by an
external source. due to the lorentz invariance of the formulation it follows that
moving solitons feel a lorentz force of a strength proportional to their velocity.
this force appears also in dual form as an interaction of the time component of
the soliton current with the time component of the curvature eld.

there may be a further interaction due to a possible violation of eq. (146) by
external elds. this interaction is due to a non-vanishing external connection
eld ~ at non-vanishing  ~j .

in the limit of distances large compared to the fundamental length r0 the
soliton eld degenerates to q = i~~n and solitons can be described by worldlines
x ( ) and the action of a free solitonic particle of mass m0

sf p = m0c2z d z d4x 4(x  x( ))r dx

d

dx 
d

.

(149)

30

in this limit it is possible to show that electromagnetic forces are a consequence
of topology [15]. let us follow these arguments.

we dene an abelian eld strength f by

f (x) = 

e0

40c

[~n(x)  ~n(x)]~n(x)

(150)

and get from eq. (65) the action of a free abelian eld

sf f = 

1

40 z d4x f(x) f  (x) =

1

40 z d4x f (x)f  (x).

(151)

from eq. (95) we obtain the ux condition

is(u,v)

dudv fuv(x) = 

e0
0

z(s)

(152)

where z is the charge inside of the closed surface s(u, v) parametrised by u and
v. since this equation holds for any volume it holds also dierentially

f (x) = 

e0

0c z d

x ( )

d

4(x  x( )).

(153)

in a variational procedure we can add to the action of the free eld and of the
free soliton the constraint (153) with a lagrange multiplier a(x) and get the
action

s =z d4x{

extremising s with respect to x ( ) leads to

dx

.

(155)

by a variation with respect to ~n one obtains the relation between f(x) and
a(x)

f(x) = a   a

(156)

which shows that the lagrange multiplier appears as the gauge potential of an
abelian eld and the action (154) is that of an abelian theory. the phase space
of this abelian theory is restricted to physical states [12] with charges restricted
to integer multiples of the elementary charge e0, as was discussed in sect. 3.

solitons feel coulomb- and lorentz forces. their interaction with the electro

9 types of stable soliton congurations

the topological charge q can be used to classify stable su (2) soliton cong-
urations which are solutions of the variational problem (42). in sect. 2.4 we
discussed stable eld congurations of hedgehog type (27). for these congu-
rations the colour direction ~n agrees with the unit vector in space ~r/r. stable
soliton congurations exist for q = 1, 3, 5,    . as dened in eq. (96) these
congurations are also characterised by the electric charge e0.

by a global rotation of the local coordinate system the connection  trans-
forms like a vector (86). therefore, electric and topological charge are invariants
under such global gauge transformations.

schematic drawings of such stable soliton congurations are very instructive.
in fig. 3a we depict a eld conguration with q = 1. the soliton eld q is
uniquely represented by its imaginary part ~q = ~n sin . one can clearly see that
the singularity of the ~n-eld at the center is suppressed by sin  approaching
zero. an example of this eld after a global gauge transformation is shown in
fig 3b. it results from a -rotation of the colour vectors around the z-axis.

for the choice ~n = ~r/r the soliton elds are characterised by negative
topological and positive electric charge. two such eld congurations are shown

soliton elds of a positron. the left diagram corresponds to the choice ~n =  ~r

and the right diagram to ~n = ( x

r ) for the internal colour degrees of
freedom. both soliton elds are equivalent.

r , y

in fig. 4. the right diagram diers again from the left one by a rotation of the
local coordinate systems by  around the z-axis.

since negative winding numbers in eq. (63) are equivalent to negative ~n it is
useful to consider the combined quantity ~q = ~n sin  which is the imaginary part
of the soliton eld q. in the left diagram of fig. 3 we show a schematic picture
of the hedgehog solution (27) with q = 1. by a global rotation of the locale
coordinate systems we get other solutions with the same energy and topological
charge since ~ transforms like a vector (85). the right diagram of fig. 3 shows
the hedgehog solution after a -rotation around the z-axis.

as we discussed already in sect. 2.2 there seems to be a strong similiarity
between the properties of solitons and charged leptons. one could therefore
try to identify higher topological charges with  and  leptons. but it seems
dicult to describe the high mass rations between these leptons.

due to the potential energy term (40) we cant construct soliton states of
nite energy with an even topological charge (30) and a prole function (~r)
depending only on the radius r. we can ask whether soliton elds are possible
with a prole function which is not spherically symmetric? lets concentrate
for symplicity at congurations which cover s3
1/2 twice. for them (~r) would
have to approach in all radial directions an element with zero potential energy,
q(, , ) = i~~n(, , ). somewhere in space one expects two center elements
of su (2), which would also be the centers of two interacting solitons. such
congurations we are going to discuss in the next section. there we will also
develop some ideas about the relation of such congurations to spin quantum
numbers.

33

9.1 many-particle states

there are some interesting puzzles in the conventional treatment of many-
fermion systems.
in quantum mechanics we expand states of many fermions
in a basis of product wave functions, of slater determinants. the antisymmetry
of many particle wave function guarantees that two equal particles dont occupy
the same place. when the interacting particles leave the interaction region they
become independent and nally only single particle states are measured in a
detector. due to antisymmetry of the many-particle wave function quantum
mechanics predicts in general an entangelment of states and cant predict which
components are really measured. the reduction of the wave function in the
measurement process is still an open question. a further puzzle concerns the
non-locality of the anti-symmetric wave function and is presently again in hot
discussion under the name of the einstein-podolsky-rosen paradox.

in this article we treat fermions as topological excitations of a bosonic eld.
because of their topological structure the pauli principle in its rst version,
that fermions cant occupy the same quantum state, is guaranteed automati-
cally. the simplest and very instructive example is a pair of solitons in the
sinegordon-model. if two solitons approach each other, they are repelled. a
two-soliton function is a function of one coordinate only describing a doubly
charged state. it is not constructed as a product wave function of two essen-
tially point-like objects. in analogy to this behaviour, there is no need for an
antisymmetry of a fermionic many-particle state in our topological model, there
is no reduction of the wave function after a spatial separation of scattering parti-
cles and no epr-paradox for fermions. these eects seem to be connected with
the description of a many-fermion state by a superposition of antisymmetric
product wave functions of point-like structureless objects.

we will now discuss qualitatively some two-particle congurations in our
soliton model. in this way we will also get some insight how the spin properties
of fundamental particles may be implemented. the simplest two-particle states
could be particle-antiparticle, positronium-like, states.
in the sinegordon-
model such states are not stationary. solitons and antisolitons attract each
other and annihilate. in a mathematical construction we can stabilize soliton-
antisoliton solutions by appropriate constraints in a variational procedure. we
constrain our solutions by xing the positions of the centers of positive and
negative charges to

~r+ = (0, 0, 

r
2

),

~r = (0, 0, +

r
2

).

(159)

and assume for simplicity the distance r between the two centers to be much
larger than r0.

positronium is uncharged and the u (1) gauge eld gets trivial at innity,
i.e.
it approaches a constant. therefore, without loss of generality we can x
the soliton eld at innity to q() = i3. an appropriate combination of the
elds of solitons and antisolitons of fig. 3 leads to a common soliton eld of
the type depicted in fig. 5. it is rotational symmetric around the z-axis. the

34

z

figure 5: schematic diagram of the eld ~n sin  for a positronium-like state. it
is rotational symmetric arout the z-axis. we want to underline that the arrows
do not indicate the electric ux lines but rather the values of the soliton eld.
it is interesting to see that approaching centers do not lead to an increase of
curvature of the soliton eld, the two opposite charges can easily annihilate if
they belong to the same hemisphere of s3 as discussed in the text.

quaternion eld in the center of the positive and negative charge is a center
element of su (2). it can still be chosen arbitrarily. it can be easily understood
from fig. 6 that congurations with equal center elements q( r
2 ) = q( r
2 )
have lower energy than those with dierent center elements q( r
2 ) = q( r
2 ).
fig. 6 shows the schematic prole of the behaviour of the internal variable 
along the z-axis. the upper diagram with two equal center elements has no zero
at r = 0 and corresponds to a quaternion eld which covers one hemisphere of
s3 twice, at least for large distance of the two charges. for an approaching pair
the coverings of the hemisphere are not anymore complete and the curvature
term in the energy should reduce. such a conguration seems to correspond to
the ground state of positronium which is a spin-singlet state. as rst numerical
calculations show the two charges feel an attractive coulomb potential at large
distances and start to annihilate at short distances. this can also be seen
graphically from fig. 5. approaching charges do not lead to an increase of the
curvature of the soliton eld. the lower diagram of fig. 6 depicts a conguration
which covers the whole sphere s3 and cant contract to a trivial eld. it could
be assigned to triplet positronium which can only decay via emission of three
photons.

state.

of positronium it may seem naturale to relate the center elements of solitons
q = 1 to spin-up and spin-down states of electrons. but the relation between
magnetic spin quantum numbers and center elements is not so simple. quantum
mechanics allows a slow rotation of electrons from spin-up to spin-down states.
in this soliton model one cant transform a soliton with a center element q = 1
by a rotation to q = 1. this gives the hint that soliton elds which dier by
a multiplication with a center element should be treated as identical. in other
words the soliton congurations should be classied by the group so(3) =
su (2)/z2. in this case one could not directly assing a magnetic spin quantum
number to soliton elds modelling a single electron. only to manyparticle
states one could assign a spin via the dierent possibilities to get connected eld
congurations in so(3). the two types of congurations discussed above would
then correspond to two congurations on s3
1/2 with dierently connected double
coverings of s3
1/2. the singlet conguration with a trivial connectedness and the
triplet conguration which is connected only via the identication of pairs of
su (2) elements with the same element of so(3).
in this sense there is not
much dierence between su (2) and so(3) congurations and we can continue
to think in terms of su (2) eld congurations which seem much simpler to

36

imagine and to depict. we have to keep in mind only that eld conguations
which dier by a global multiplication with a center element are identical.

with the so(3) interpretation there remains the essential dierence to quan-
tum mechanics that to single electrons we cant attribute a spin quantum num-
ber.
in this respect it may be interesting that there is no successful stern-
gerlach experiment for single electrons. according to the knowledge of the
author such types of experiments work only for uncharged systems, like the
famous experiment which was done with neutral ag-atoms.
in our model a
rotation of a single electron would correspond to a global gauge transformation
(81) of the soliton eld. such a transformation by  around the z-axis was
applied in fig. 3 between left and right diagram. it seems obvious that such a
rigid rotation in the whole space is not possible in nite time due to the nite
speed of light. such a rotation seems easily possible for an uncharged ag-atom
whose soliton eld should be non-trivial only inside the atomic radius.

other interesting eld-congurations are those corresponding to electron
pairs. one can get a rst trial conguration of that type by glueing together two
identical soliton congurations, like that in the left diagram of fig. 3. but in
this way one gets a eld conguration with very high curvature in the boundary
plane, i.e. a highly excited state. in a minimisation process the two solitons start
to rotate against each other and end up in a conguration which is schemati-
cally shown in fig. 7. we want to emphasize that these diagrams depict the
imaginary part ~q = ~n sin  of the soliton eld and not the electric ux lines.
the electric ux lines are given by the curvature of the soliton eld. outside
of the soliton cores at ~r = (0, 0, r/2) they are expected to be identical to the
well-known ux lines between equal charges. in the soliton eld in fig. 7 the
part corresponding to the upper electron is identical to the soliton eld in the
left diagram of fig. 3. the lower part results from a rotation by  around the
y-axis around the center of the corresponding soliton. one can clearly see that
at large distances from the charge centers the soliton eld approaches sin = 1
and covers the internal sphere s2 twice as it is necessary for a system with
electric charge 2e0. the two cuts through the soliton elds show that rota-
tional symmetry is lost on the level of the soliton eld. it should not be lost on
the level of electric ux lines for distances large compared to r0 after a gauge
transformation of the su (2)-eld to a u (1)-eld. as rst numerical calcula-
tions show such eld congurations have the behaviour of a repulsive coulomb
potential. this behaviour is expected also from the shape of the soliton eld.
if the two equal charges approach each other the curvature in the x-z-plane in-
creases leading to a repulsion of the two charges. again we expect an inuence
from the choice of the su (2) center elements at the two charge centers. for
q( r
1/2 are not com-
plete. this state is therefore slightly favored by the curvature energy and should
describe the 1s0 ground state of a double electron system. the soliton eld is in
this case symmetric under a -rotation around the y-axis which exchanges the
two electrons. for the other case, q( r
2 ) two dierent hemispheres
in internal space are completely covered corresponding most likely to an excited
spin-triplet state. according to the above described so(3) interpretation one

can extract the non-trivial center element of su (2) from the eld of the cor-
responding electron, e.g. for negative z-values. this reverts the arrows in the
negative z-region of the diagrams in fig. 7. the soliton eld is then asymmetric
against an exchange of the two particles via a -rotation around the y-axis.

this rst qualitative analysis seems to indicate that one can possibly relate
the choice of center elements in the centers of the solitons with the spin quan-
tum numbers in quantum mechanics. a more detailed analysis including orbital
angular momenta will of course be necessary for a deeper understanding of the
relation of the soliton eld to the quantum mechanical wave-function and its
symmetry properties. in this respect it will also be of big interest to study the
behaviour of single solitons and many-soliton congurations in external mag-
netic elds and to compare it with the well-known experimental results.

10 conclusions

our picture of the submicroscopic world has moved far away from intuition.
there may be some hope that we can nd a description which leads us to a
deeper understanding of fundamental particles and their properties.

in this model we generalise the sinegordon model to four dimensions. our
aim is to treat fermions as topological excitations of a bosonic eld. we intro-
duce a eld of unimodular quaternions, an su (2)-eld for the internal degrees
of freedom. the lagrangian contains essentially two terms, a curvature term

38

and a potential energy term. the curvature term agrees with the skyrme term
of the skyrme model, it corresponds further to the curvature term in gauge
theories. with respect to gauge theories there is the essential dierence that in
gauge theories the basic eld is the gauge eld which denes the parallel trans-
port of vector or spinor elds from one local coordinate system to another. in
our model the basic eld is the soliton eld. the gauge eld is a derived eld,
the eld of connection coecients between dierent local coordinate systems
and can be expressed fully in terms of the soliton eld. the second term in the
lagrangian is a potential term. it corresponds to the potential term in the sine
gordon model and leads to the stabilisation of nontrivial soliton solutions. it
breaks the rotational symmetry in the internal space s3. since the bottom of
the potential is a two-dimensional manifold it allows for two types of massless
excitations, the two polarisations of freely propagating electro-magnetic waves.
this model has several interesting features which solve long standing puzzles

in particle physics.

 it explains by topology why only electric particles appear in nature and

not their magnetic counterparts.

 it treats fermions as extended objects. therefore, many deep diculties
of quantum eld theories seem not to appear in this theory. there seems
to be no need for renormalisation leading to a momentum dependence
of coupling constants. such a dependence on the transfered momentum
appears quite naturally for topological fermions as an analogon to hookes
law for elastic bodies at a microscopic level.

 the origin of mass is explained by the eld energy of these extended

particles.

 relativistic properties of fundamental particles, like velocity dependence
of mass and lorentz contraction, can be understood at a microscopic level
analogous to the sinegordon model.

 there is no need to introduce special anticommuting elds, grassmann
elds, to describe the dynamics of fermions. all eld components are real
valued in this model. the essential point in the description with quater-
nionic elds seems to be that unimodular quaternions allow for a smooth
transfer of energy from one degree of freedom to another. such a possi-
bility for an energy transfer we nd in many basic phenomena in physics,
especially in all oscillatory motions. in oscillating pendula the energy os-
cillates between kinetic and potential energy, in two coupled pendula the
energy is transfered periodically between the two pendula, in electromag-
netic waves the eld energy oscillates between electric and magnetic eld
components, in the quantum mechanical description of a free particle the
energy oscillates between the real and the imaginary part of the wave func-
tion, etc. in our model two of the eld components seem to be undamped,
those are essentially the two polarisations of the electro-magnetic, of the
u (1)-eld. all other components are massive and therefore damped. they

39

cannot propagate freely in space. this last property seems to be impor-
tant for an extension of the model to other fundamental forces, like the
colour and the weak force.

 our model of topological fermions suggests a classical resolution to the
epr paradox for fermions. the wave functions of many fermions are not
antisymmetrised product wave functions of point-like particles but rather
intrinsically of many body type. for large distances topological fermions
approach asymptotically unique single-particle states. our model possibly
sheds also some light on the problems which appear in quantum mechanics
in connection with the reduction of the wave function in the measurement
process.

 there is a well-known doubling problem in the formulation of fermionic
elds on a discretised space-time lattice. the soliton model of fermions
resolves this problem by treating them as extended objects.

there remain of course many open questions in connection with this topo-

logical model of fermions. some of them were already mentioned.

 it is not yet clear whether the running of the coupling, the dependence of
the strength of the interaction on the transfered momentum, is described
quantitatively correct.

 a quantisation of the model is possible via the path integral formula-
tion. quantum corrections can be evaluated around the soliton solutions.
a related problem concerns the analysis of the renormalisability of this
quantised theory.

 there are many questions in connection with the spin properties of solitons
and their interaction with an external electro-magnetic eld. especially
it should be claried if the interaction of singlet and triplet positronium
states with an external magnetic eld is adequately described.

 the structure of excited positronium states with non-zero angular mo-
mentum must be studied and the decay properties of positronium states
have to be compared with the experimental predictions.
in our model
singlet positronium can annihilate without topological restrictions, since
its winding number is zero. in the quantum eld theoretical description
it decays via twophoton emission, whereas triplet positronium decays
via three-photon emission. in our model triplet positronium has winding
number two. its decay is inhibited and the appropriate mechanism for its
decay is still unclear.

 we studied a special form of the potential energy density hp. there are
other forms possible which lead to nite energy predictions. since the
prediction of the spectrum of charged leptons seems not to be in very
good agreement with the experiment, one should possibly think about
other dependences.

40

 in potentials with innitely high walls one expects excited states char-
acterised by the number of osziallor quanta. such states one could also
expect for the solitons of this model. are these the same states which
we have characterised by the winding number nw? it is an interesting
question if such states could be excited by the transversal electromagnetic
eld.

 a more general question concerns the extension of the model to higher
groups treating other types of interactions. it seems quite clear that an
extension to su (3) should be used to describe the colour force inside
strongly interacting particles. according to the standard model, w-bosons
are the gauge bosons of the weak interaction. one could speculate that w-
bosons, as they have a denite mass, are not quanta of fundamental elds
but rather composite objects, i.e. topological excitations of an su (4)- or
su (5)-eld.

 baryons in an su (3)-model should most likely not be described by three
separated fundamental objects, the quarks, rather by topological stable
su (3) eld congurations describing the whole baryon. this may lead
to an explanation of connement by intrinsic topological properties of the
gluon eld. there would be no need for a non-trivial vacuum, a picture
which is used in quantum chromo dynamics.

 a deep puzzle concerns the structure of neutrinos. originally the author
believed that neutrinos are connected with even winding numbers of the
quaternion eld. but this idea turned out to be erroneous. it is not yet
clear how neutrinos should be included in some version of this topological
model of fermions.

if some version of this model should turn out to be a good candidate for
the description of fundamental particles it should be compatible with quantum
mechanics. via the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics this should
be easily possible.

the dierential geometrical formulation of this model seems to give a nat-
ural possibility for the inclusion of general relativity. but it is not clear how a
gravitational 1/r2-force could appear between neutral particles. better under-
standable seems a variation of the speed of light in matter and a deection of
plane electro-magnetic waves by solitons.
