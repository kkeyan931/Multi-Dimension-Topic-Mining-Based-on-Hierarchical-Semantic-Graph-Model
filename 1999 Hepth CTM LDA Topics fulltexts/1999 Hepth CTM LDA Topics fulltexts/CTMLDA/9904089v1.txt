non-standard overview on the possible formulation towards a unied model
on the lattice is presented. it is based on the generalized gauge theory which
is formulated by dierential forms and thus expected to t in a simplicial
manifold. we rst review suggestive known results towards this direction.
as a small step of concrete realization of the program, we propose a lattice
chern-simons gravity theory which leads to the chern-simons gravity in the
continuum limit via ponzano-regge model. we then summarize the quanti-
zation procedure of the generalized gauge theory and apply the formulation
to the generalized topological yang-mills action with instanton gauge xing.
we nd n = 2 super yang-mills theory with dirac-kahler fermions which are
generated from ghosts via twisting mechanism. the weinberg-salam model
is formulated by the generalized yang-mills action which includes conness
non-commutative geometry formulation as a particular case.
in the end a
possible scenario to realize the program is proposed. the formulations given
here are by far incomplete towards the nal goal yet include hopeful evi-
dences. this summary of the overview is the extended version of the talk
given at nishinomiya-yukawa memorial symposium (nishinomiya-city japan,

1 introduction

it is obviously the most challenging problem how to formulate the quantum gravity

and the standard model in a unifying and constructive way. towards a possible so-

lution to this problem, the current trend is heading to the string related topics[1][2].

it is, however, not obvious that the string is the only possible formulation lead-

ing to the unied theory including quantum gravity. in fact, the two dimensional

quantum gravity was formulated by a lattice gravity, the dynamical triangulation

of random surface[3] which was analytically conrmed by liouville theory[4]. on

the other hand the three dimensional einstein gravity was successfully formulated

by the chern-simons action even at the quantum level [5]. there are thus other

formulations of quantum gravity than the string related formulation.

one of the important motivations that the super string could be the genuine

formulation of unifying all the forces of gauge theories is that the super string may be

able to control the divergences even with gravity, and thus the renormalizability and

unitarity are natural consequences of the formulation. an alternative formulation

to control the divergences would be the lattice formulation.

suppose we aim to formulate a unied model, what could be the possible criteria

to believe that it could be a realistic model. eventually the unied model should

explain the origin of the following phenomenological parameters and characteristics:

1. the group structure of the standard model: su(3)  su(2)  u(1).
2. the number of generation = 3.

3. the pairing structure of quarks and leptons in the standard model: quarks

interact strongly, weakly and electromagnetically while leptons interact dier-

ently.

4. our space-time is four dimension and minkowskian.

5. the quark and lepton masses, the mixing parameters; cabbibo-kobayashi-

maskawa angles and possible lepton mixing angles.

1

the fundamental unied theory should eventually propose a mean to evaluate

the item 5 quantitatively. from the experiences of the lattice qcd it would be di-

cult to calculate the phenomenological quantities analytically from the fundamental

theory. instead we need to evaluate them numerically thus we need to formulate a

constructive denition of a regularized unied theory including gravity.

concerning to the issues of quantum gravity it is more dicult to judge what

could be the experimental evidences to conrm the quantum nature of the gravity.

it could possibly be reected to the large scale structure of the universe yet un-

convincing. as we show later the quantum gravity in two dimensions can be well

understood by the numerical simulations on the lattice which are conrmed analyt-

ically as well. we expect that numerical method by lattice would be the only mean

to evaluate the quantum nature of gravity even in higher dimensions.

we thus believe that lattice theory is again a good candidate to fulll our re-

quirements for the quantitative unied theory.

in the above phenomenologically

known results the rst four items could be understood easier than the last one and

could be related with the super symmetry.

in this summary of overview we propose the generalized gauge theory which

was proposed previously by the present author and y.watabiki [6] as a formulation

towards a unied model on the lattice. in order to persuade the readers to accept the

ideas and formulation i will collect the suggestive known results and include several

recent investigations towards this direction and thus the summary is aimed to be self-

contained. our formulation is a non-standard approach towards the unied model

and the formulation is not yet completed but there are several hopeful evidences that

this approach may play an important role for the unied theory of the fundamental

interactions.

here we list the contents of this summary towards a non-standard approach of

a unied model on the lattice.

2 suggestive known results towards unied model

on the lattice

2.1 fermionic matter on the lattice

in considering the formulation towards the unied model on the lattice, i will rst

give a very suggestive and simple example to gure out how to nd the possible

model on the lattice. the rst example is the two dimensional ising model. it is

well known that the ising model has a second order phase transition point and the

model leads to a free fermion theory in a at space at the phase transition point

in the continuum limit.
in this system the lattice is the two dimensional square
lattice and the matter eld is sitting at the sites of the lattice and takes value 1.
what is surprising here is that the simple square lattice with the simplest matter

at the site reproduces the fermionic matter in the continuum limit. it is by now

established that the ising spin on the dynamically triangulated lattice reproduces

the free fermion coupled to a gravitational background in the continuum limit. see

g.1. this is a very symbolic example that matter fermion is generated via degrees

of freedom of eld sitting on sites and the curved space-time background is generated

by the dynamically triangulated lattice in the continuum limit. in other words eld

theoretical matter and background gravitational eld are essentially reproduced by

the lattice formulation.

4

it is important to recognize that there is a microscopic formulation to see how

the fermionic degrees appear at the lattice level[7][8]. let me sketch the formulation.

the partition function of ising model is

z = x=

exp{ x<ij>

ij},

(2.1)

where < ij > is a nearest neighbor pair of sites on a two dimensional square lattice.

we introduce the so called disorder parameter[9]

x =

xy

exp {2},

(2.2)

where the exponents in the product correspond to the links which are crossed by
the dashed line starting from the dual site x and ending at . we introduce the
product of the disorder variable x and order variables x

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

where x1, x2, x3 and x4 are original sites and surround the dual site x. here we
assume that the  variables are always inside some correlation function (x) =
xx < xx    >. then the eect of the disorder variable is to ip the sign of
 in the action along the dashed line.

there is the following identity:

 exp{2} = ch(2)  sh(2),

(2.7)

which combines with the disorder variable x and leads to a graphical relation

= ch(2)

 sh(2)

(2.12)

equivalently

1(x) = ch(2)2(x  1)  sh(2)3(x  1),

(2.9)

where 1 is a unit vector of 1 direction on the lattice. we can obtain similar relations
for 2(x), 3(x) and 4(x), where we can use the invariance under a simultaneous
change of n  n and n  n for an arbitrary given site n.

(3(x)  4(x)),

(2.10)

(2.11)

we obtain

where the unit vectors are related 3 = 1 and 4 = 2. this can be understood as a
hopping relation of the  elds on the lattice. under the proper renormalization of
the  elds, the hopping matrix is identied with the inverse propagator of fermion

elds[7].

it is important to recognize that the microscopic description of the elds on the

lattice is reected to the eld theoretic description of fermionic eld in the continuum

limit.

by now we know that the ising spin located at sites of a dynamically triangulated

lattice leads to a fermionic matter coupled to gravity in the continuum limit[10][11].

in this case there is also a microscopic description of how fermionic degrees appear

on the random lattice. let me briey sketch the derivation. here we dont follow

to the matrix model formulation[11] but give more direct derivation. we rst note

the standard observation concerning ising model: the general conguration of spins

can be considered as a set of alternating black drops ( = 1) and white bubbles
( = 1). the boundaries between drops and bubbles are drawn on the dual graph.
see g. 2 . the dual graph includes only three vertex on a dual site and thus
coincides with feynmann graphs of 3 theory. if we look at particular dual site, a

boundary line may pass through the site or may not touch at all.

6

figure 2: ising spin on a dynamically triangulated lattice

we can show that the above mentioned property is reproduced by the following

fermionic action on the lattice[10]

with the action

s =

(i)k(i, j)(j).

(2.14)

we adopt the notation  =  and the normalization of grassmann integral

z d2  = .

(2.15)

there are two important properties to be satised by the action. (1) the boundary

line does not possess particular direction thus the fermion must have majorana

nature. (2) the back-tracking motion is absent. these properties are satised by

the following constraints:

(1)

(2)

(i)k(i, j)(j) = (j)k(j, i)(i)

k(i, j)k(j, i) = 0.

the majorana condition (1) can be written in a matrix form:

2k(i, j) = (2k(j, i))t ,

where (2) = i is the pauli matrix and t stands for transpose.

7

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

the above two constraints will be satised, provided k(i, j) has the form

k(i, j) = a(ij)(1 + 1n1(ij) + 3n3(ij)),

(2.19)

where

a(ij) = a(ji), n1(ij) = n1(ji), n3(ij) = n3(ji),

(n1(ij))2 + (n3(ij))2 = 1.
(2.20)

we can then guess a possible strategy how to get a eld theory coupled gravity

on the lattice. the gravitational background is generated by the dynamical tri-

angulation and the matter elds are generated by the elds on the simplex of the

simplicial manifold.

2.2 success of two dimensional quantum gravity on the

lattice

as we have seen in the previous section that ising model on the two dimensional

square lattice is equivalent to the free fermion theory of the at space time in the

continuum limit. on the other hand it is analytically known by now that ising model

on the randomly triangulated lattice is equivalent to the free fermion theory coupled

to the two dimensional gravity[10][11]. these examples suggest that curved space

time is generated by the random lattice and the matter elds are induced by some
degrees of freedom on a simplex: for ising model 1 values on the sites (0-simplex).
in two dimensions the relation between the lattice theory and the corresponding

continuum eld theory were analytically established with the help of conformal eld

theory. the central charge c specifying a matter content of the continuum theory

is a measure to dierentiate dierent types of matrix models. the equivalence of a

lattice model and the corresponding matrix model is established and the liouville

theory gave complementary understandings to the lattice theories[4][3][12].

in two dimensional quantum gravity conformal dimensions are predicted both

by lattice models and the corresponding continuum theories and gave the same

predictions. it is important to measure these physical quantities. numerically it
has been conrmed that two dimensional quantum space time coupled to c = 2
matter show clear fractal scaling and the fractal dimension is consistent with the

theoretical value[13][14].

2.2.1 microscopic description of two dimensional random surface

in general it is highly nontrivial how to relate a microscopic description of lattice the-

ory and the corresponding continuum theory. in two dimensions it is possible to take

a continuum limit of lattice theories for some particular cases. it has already been

established that the matrix model is powerful tool to solve some lattice models in

two dimensions and the procedure how to get the continuum limit is established[12].

here we give an example which has well dened microscopic description of c = 0

lattice model and the continuum limit.

we rst derive a transfer matrix of two dimensional random surface on the lattice

and take the continuum limit and derive the fractal structure of the c = 0 random

surface, a dynamically triangulated lattice without matter[15].

we consider the cylinder amplitude n(l, l; r; n) which counts a number of pos-

sible triangulations of random surface for a shape of cylinder with a entrance loop
length l, a marked exit loop length l, the geodesic distance of the two loops r and the

number of triangles n. see g. 3. this quantity satises the following composition

law:

n(l, l; r1 + r2; n1 + n2) =xl

n(l, l; r1; n1)n(l, l; r2; n2).

figure 5: one step entrance moves

we dene the following quantity by summing up the triangles with a parameter k:

n(l, l, r) 

xn=0

k nn(l, l; r; n)  ( n (r))ll,

which satises the following relation

( n (r))ll = (( n(1))r)ll.

(2.22)

(2.23)

we can thus claim that ( n (1))ll is the transfer matrix of two dimensional surface.
we now dene the generating function of the transfer matrix by parametrizing y
and y for the entrance and exit loop length, respectively

n(y, y; k) 

xl,l=0

yl(y)l

n(l, l; 1).

(2.24)

it is surprising to recognize that the generating function of the transfer matrix can

be obtained by a simple geometric series of the possible one steps

n (y, y; k) = (2yy2k + y2ykf )

xn=0
[yy2k + y2ykf + y2f + yk(f  1)]n

2yy2k + y2ykf

=

1  yy2k  y2ykf  y2f  yk(f  1)

,

(2.25)

where f is a disk amplitude derived by brezin, itzykson, parisi and zuber[16]. the

term in the parenthesis in the rst line of (2.25) is possible one step forward with

marked point of the exit loop in the dynamical triangulation while the four terms

in the square bracket is all the possible steps forward in the entrance loop. see g.4

and 5. it is interesting to note that the geometrical structure of the random surface

10

is directly reected to the analytic expression of the transfer matrix.

for the c = 0 random surface it is known how to take the continuum limit of

random surface for the disk amplitude f by [16]. here we simply point out that

the continuum limit of the generating function of the transfer matrix can be taken

in a well dened way. we can then obtain a continuum expression of the cylinder

amplitude by solving dierential equation. the details of this interesting example

to obtain the continuum expression from the above lattice transfer matrix can be

found in [15]. by using the continuum cylinder amplitude we can derive interesting

quantities which have direct relation with the fractal structure of the random surface

and thus can be measured numerically.

let (l; r)dl be the continuum counterpart of the number of loops belonging

to the boundary whose lengths lie between l and l + dl. here l and r are

continuum counterparts of l and r, respectively. the (l; r)dl turns out to be a

scaling function in the continuum limit

(l; r)dl = (cid:16) 3

7(cid:17) 1

r2 (x5/2 +

2

x3/2 +

14
3

x1/2)exp(x)

(2.26)

with x = l/r2 as a scaling parameter. it is very surprising that there is a scal-

ing function for the quantum gravity. this (l; r)dl can be compared with the

numerically measured value.

2.2.2 numerical results on the fractal structure of two dimensional

quantum gravity on the lattice

it is important to ask what could be the observables of quantum gravity, which could

be numerically measured. we have conrmed the fractal nature of the quantum
gravity for c = 2 model numerically[13], which is the rst numerical conrmation
of the fractal nature of quantum gravity. we have analyzed the following scalar
fermion models corresponding to c = 2 model:
d idiexp{ x<ij>

( i  j)(i  j)}

s = xt z yit
= xt

1

det(t )

=

n + 2

tn +1rn +1,

(2.27)

11

where all the possible triangulation t are summed up. the scalar fermions are

located on the dynamically triangulated lattice sites and thus (t ) is the lattice

laplacian for the triangulation t . tn +1 and rn +1 are the number of tree and rainbow

diagrams with n vertices and external lines, respectively. tree feynman diagrams
of 3 theory and planar triangulations have one to one correspondence. here we x

the topology of the surface as a sphere and the number of triangles to be n. tn and

rn satisfy the same schwinger-dyson equation:

tn =

n1xk=1

tktnk,

(2.28)

which leads to the solution tn = (2n  2)!/n!(n  1)! and rn has the same form.

since we know the analytic expression of tn and rn we can reconstruct arbitrary

triangulation of sphere topology by combining the tree and rainbow diagrams with
the correct weight. the essential point of the c = 2 model is that it has the very
simple relation (2.27) due to the rst power of the lattice laplacian. then tn and rn

have very simple form and thus numerically huge number of triangulated surfaces

can be generated.

we have used the formulation called recursive sampling method to generate

the surface conguration numerically which was initiated by agistein and migdal

for c = 0 model [17]. we have measured several quantities, in particular the number

of triangles v (r) within a geodesic distance r parameterized by

v (r)  < number of triangles within r steps >  r.

(2.29)

we have found that the fractal dimension  approaches a constant value   3.55
with large n( 5  106). this is the clear sign of the fractal scaling of two dimen-
sional random surface[13]. see g.6

we have thus numerically conrmed that the fractal structure is the essential

observable of two dimensional quantum gravity. in these numerical measurements

we needed huge number of triangles to get saturated value of the fractal dimension.

later we have used the formulation of nite size scaling methods applied to

the quantum gravity and then we obtained very accurate value of the fractal di-

mension even with relatively smaller number of triangles but with huge number of

congurations[18]. we dene the following quantity:

12

figure 6: direct measurement of fractal dimension of c = 2 model

< ln(r) >

ln(l, r),

xl=1

(2.30)

where l(r) is the length of boundary loops located at r steps from a marked point

and (l, r) is the lattice counterpart of the quantity dened in (2.26) for a given num-

ber of triangles n. finite size scaling formulation of the two dimensional quantum

gravity predicts the following formula:

< ln(r) >  (n)2n/df fn(y)

(n  2)

y =

,

(2.31)

r

(n)1/df

where n is the number of triangles and f (y) is a scaling function and y is the scaling

parameter. as we can see in gs.7, the data are beautifully scaling for f2, f3, f4

with various numbers of triangles which are given in gures.

the numerical result for the fractal dimension of quantum space time coupled
to c = 2 matter by comparing the above formula with the numerical distributions
of f s is

df = 3.56  0.04.

on the other hand we gave the theoretical prediction of the fractal dimension of

two dimensional space time coupled to c matter by liouville theory [14]

df = 2

25  c + 49  c
25  c + 1  c

the numerical result and the theoretical data are perfectly consistent.

here we have given an example, c = 2 model, of two dimensional quantum
gravity which are well understood numerically and analytically. we claim that the

essence of the two dimensional quantum gravity is the fractal nature of the space

time.

2.3 susskind fermionstaggered fermiondirac kahler

fermion on the lattice

if we want to put fermions on the lattice, there is the well known chiral fermion

problem. the problem states that we cannot put chiral fermions on the lattice with

avoiding species doublers[19]. or otherwise it is stated that the anomaly vanishes

if we put fermions in a chiral invariant way[20]. wilsons proposal on this respect

is to introduce non-chiral term in the lattice action and then each species doubler

except for one gets a mass of order the inverse lattice constant and thus disappear

in the continuum limit[21]. then the chirality will be recovered and the remaining

unique species generates the necessary anomaly in the continuum limit.

in fact

there is a clear chiral invariant line on the hopping parameter-coupling constant

plane where the quak mass and the pion mass vanishes in the wilsons lattice qcd

formulation[22].

there is an alternative approach on this problem. the origin of the species

doublers are related to the simplicial nature of the manifold. susskind proposed an

14

idea to collect these species doublers to construct dirac fermions[23]. for example
in four dimensional square lattice there are 24 = 16 corners of brillouin zone in the

momentum space and each doubler corresponds to a component of the dirac spinors

thus leads to four avor copies of dirac fermions.

one of the essential points here is to recognize that the species doublers in

the conguration space correspond to points located at the center of the sim-

plexes of the fundamental hyper cube. this is related to do with the fact that the

susskind fermion formulation is the at space version of the dirac-kahler fermion

formulation[24][25] which is formulated by dierential forms and thus independent

of the particular choice of lattice shape and thus can be identied as a fermion

formulation on the simplicial manifold.

here we explain this situation by starting from the naive fermion formulation.

if we naively discretize the dirac equation on the square lattice we obtain

sf =

1

2xx,

[(x)(x + )  (x + )(x)],

(2.33)

where x denotes the lattice site with integer coordinates x1, x2,   , xd in units of
lattice spacing which is taken to be 1.  is the unit vector along the th direction.

the -matrices satisfy the following cliord algebra:

{, } = 2,

(2.34)

with the conventions  =  in d-dimension. we proposed the following transfor-
mation which relates the naive fermion formulation and susskind fermion formula-

tion [26]:

where

(x) = a(x)(x),

(x) = (x)a(x),

a(x) = x1

1 x2

2    xd
d .

(2.35)

(2.36)

then the naive fermion formulation of dirac action leads to

sf = 

1

2 xx,,

with

(x)[(x)(x + ) + (x + )(x)],

(2.37)

(x) = (1)x1+x2++x1.

15

(2.38)

this formulation is called staggered fermion formulation in lattice qcd. the 

matrices in the naive fermion formulation have now disappeared in the staggered
fermion formulation. instead we get c  2[d/2] copies of spinors.

we now consider d-dimensional hypercube dened on the lattice, with its origin

at the site 2y and corners

x = 2y + ,

 = 0 or 1,  = 1,   , d.

(2.39)

thus  labels the set of c 2 d-dimensional vectors which point on the corners of the

hypercube. we introduce the following notations for the convenience:

(2y + )  (1)y(y)
(2y + )  (1)y(y)
(1)y = (1)y1++yd.

then sf can be written in the following form[27]:

,(y)],

sf =xx,x,

[(y)

,(y) + (y)e

where the rst and second lattice derivatives are

(2.40)

(2.41)

(2.42)

(2.43)

(2.44)

introducing the following notation for the fermionic elds to get rid of the factor of

trace in (2.43):

(y) = cx,a
(y) = cx,a

qa(y)

qa(y)a

(2.45)

we obtain the nal form of dirac-kahler fermion action on the at space

sf = 2dxy,

[q(y)(  1)q(y) + q(y)(5  tt5)q(y)].

(2.46)

the fermionic part of this action can be interpreted as susskind fermions while this

action has bosonic counterparts as well. the bosonic part including second derivative

is higher order than the fermionic part with respect to the lattice constant. in the

fermion bilinears the rst matrix acts on greek indices interpreted as dirac indices,

the second one on latin indices interpreted as avor indices. t stands for the matrix
 when acting on avor space, and 5 = 12    d.

2.4 chern-simons gravity and ponzano-regge model

2.4.1 chern-simons gravity

in this subsection we explain formulations of three dimensional gravity. we rst

summarize the chern-simons gravity formulated by witten[5]. we choose the gauge

group as euclidean version of three dimensional poincare group iso(3). then we

dene one form gauge eld and zero form gauge parameter as

a = ea

pa + a

ja,
v = apa +  aja,

(2.47)

where ea

 and a

 are dreibein and spin connection, respectively, and  and  are
the corresponding gauge parameters. the momentum generator pa and the angular

momentum generator ja of iso(3) satisfy

[ja, jb] = abcj c,

[ja, pb] = abcp c,

[pa, pb] = 0.

(2.48)

using the invariant quadratic form which is special in three dimensions, we can

dene the inner product

hja, pbi = ab,

hja, jbi = hpa, pbi = 0.

(2.49)

we then obtain einstein-hilbert action of three dimensional gravity from chern-

simons action

the component wise gauge transformation of a = dv is given by

ea

a

 = da  abcebc,
 = d a.

(2.51)

(2.52)

at this stage it is important to recognize that the local lorentz transformation is

generated by the gauge parameter 

ea

a

 = abcebc,
 = d a,

(2.53)

while the gauge transformation of dieomorphism is generated by the gauge param-

eter 

ea

a

 = da,
 = 0.

(2.54)

three dimensional einstein gravity is thus elegantly formulated by chern-simons

action. this is essentially related to the fact that the three dimensional einstein

gravity does not include dynamical graviton and thus can be formulated by the

topological chern-simons action. the equivalence of the above action and einstein-
hilbert action is, however, valid only if the dreibein ea

 is invertible. the quantiza-
tion and perturbative renormalizability around the nonphysical classical background
ea
 = 0 is the natural consequence of the formulation.

2.4.2 ponzano-regge model

ponzano and regge noticed that angular momenta of 6-j symbol can be identi-

ed as link lengths of a tetrahedron[28]. in particular they showed the following

approximate relation:

(1)p6

i=1 ji( j1 j2 j3

j4 j5 j6) 

1

12v

cos(cid:18)sregge +



4(cid:19) (all ji  1),

(2.55)

where sregge is the regge action of regge calculus[29] for a tetrahedron having
link length jk (k = 1  6) which correspond to the angular momentum of the
corresponding 6-j symbol and v is the volume of the tetrahedron.

figure 8: tetrahedron with angular momenta on the links

based on this observation they proposed the following partition function:

zpr = lim

xj yvertices

()1 yedges

(2j + 1) ytetrahedra

(1)p ji( j1 j2 j3
j4 j5 j6) .

(2.56)

thus the partition function zpr is the product of the partition function of each

tetrahedron which reproduces the cosine of the regge action in contrast with the

exponential of the regge action in regge calculus. there is an argument about

the origin of the cosine, that right and left handed contributions of the general

coordinate frames contribute separately and thus the summation of the exponential

with the dierent sign factor for the regge action appears.

it is thus natural to

expect that this action leads to a gravity action.

important characteristic of the ponzano-regge action is that it has a topological

nature on a simplicial manifold. the action is invariant under the following 2-3

and 1-4 alexander moves. the 2-3 and 1-4 moves are related to the following 6-j

j7 j2 j3)( j7 j2 k

the geometrical correspondence of 2-3 and 1-4 moves with two tetrahedra into three

tetrahedra and one tetrahedron into four tetrahedra is obvious from g.9. in the

formula of 1-4 move there appears the following innite sum which is then introduced

as a regularization factor in the denominator with a cuto :

(2.59)

it is known that these two alexander moves reproduce any three dimensional sim-

plicial manifold. thus the partition function zpr is invariant under the variation of

metric and is expected to be topological.

there is a beautiful generalization of this model to avoid the above cut o de-

pendence by introducing the quantum group formulation as a regularization by

20

turaev and viro[30]. their proposal triggered number of later investigations for

three dimensional lattice gravity[31][32][33]. turaev, ooguri-sasakura and boula-

tov suggested the equivalence of the chern-simons gravity and the ponzano-regge

model[30][31][32].

in the later section we show that the continuum limit of the lattice ponzano-

regge model leads to the chern-simons gravity by explicitly constructing a lattice

gauge gravity model.

2.5 four dimensional gravity on the lattice

in analogy with the formulation of three dimensional gravity by chern-simons action

and 6-j symbols of the ponzano-regge model, it is possible to formulate a four

dimensional topological gravity by bf theory and 15-j symbols [34]. there are

variants of the similar four dimensional models developed later [35][36].

ooguri proposed the following model on the four dimensional simplicial manifold

composed of four dimensional fundamental simplexes:

z =xc

1

nsym

n4(c)zc,

(2.60)

where the summation pc is over oriented four dimensional symplicial manifolds,

and nsym is a symmetric factor and n4(c) is a number of 4-simplexes in c. the

partition function for a given c is

zc = xj yt:triangles

(2jt + 1) ytetrahedra{6j} y4-simplexes{15j}

= xj xm,n yt:triangles

(2jt + 1) yt :tetrahedraz dut dj1,t (ut )    dj4,t (ut ), (2.62)

(2.61)

where the rst line is the symbolic presentation of the geometrical nature of the four

dimensional fundamental simplex which has ten triangles, each of which corresponds

to 3-j symbol, and ten 3-j symbols lead 15-j symbol, which is analogous to the

situation where 6 angular momenta were assigned to the links of tetrahedron and

four triangles of a tetrahedron carry four 3-j symbols which leads to a 6-j symbol in

three dimensions. by using the orthonormality of the 6-j symbols one can show that

the results of this summation is independent of the choice of splitting of the vertices

21

and depends only on the structure of the complex c, where extra 6-j symbols are

necessary to keep this invariance. this is again analogous to the alexander move

invariance of the ponzano-regge model.

the second line of eq.(2.62) comes from the fact that the 15-j and 6-j symbols

are written down by 3-j symbols and the products of 3-j symbols can be replaced

by the products of d functions by using the following relations:

m2n2(u ) dj3

m3n3(u) =  j1 j2 j3

n1 n2 n3! , (2.63)

m1n1(u)dj2

m1 m5 m6!  j4 j2

j5

j6

j5 j3

m4 m5 m3! , (2.64)

where the 3-j symbols carry mi suces which correspond to the third components

of the angular momentum ji. each tetrahedron t carries a group element ut , and
j1,t ,   j4,t are the spins on the links dual to the four triangles of t . the matrix
elements dj s are multiplied around triangles in c. each triangle t is shared by a
nite number of tetrahedra; t1(t), t2(t),   , tnt(t). we can perform the sum over
the spin-jt on the link dual to t using the formula

xjt

(2jt + 1)trhdjt(u (t)

t1 )    djt(u (t)

tnt

)i = (u (t)

t1    u (t)

tnt

, 1).

(2.65)

after carrying out du integration we obtain the condition that the holonomy around

the triangle t is trivial, the lattice version of at connection condition.

the above result suggests that zc is related to the partition function of the bf

model which is dened for an oriented manifold m as

zbf =z db daexp(izm

< b, da + [a, a] >),

(2.66)

where a is a connection one-form on the manifold m, while b is a lie algebra valued

two-form and <, > is the invariant bilinear form on the lie algebra. in this so called
bf action[37] with f  da + [a, a], we can consider b as lagrange multiplier then
we obtain the at connection condition which is equivalent to the lattice version

obtained from eq.(2.65). this action is the four dimensional counterpart of the

chern-simons action in the sense that the at connection condition is the equation

22

of motion. we can thus naively expect that the 15-j model leads to the bf theory

in the continuum limit. this is similar to the situation that the ponzano-regge

model leads to the chern-simons gravity in the continuum limit which we are going

to show in the later section.

3 a possible formulation towards gauge grav-
ity coupled to matter on the simplicial lattice
manifold

3.1 a possible formulation towards unied model on the

lattice

from the known results which we have collected in the last subsections, i intend to

gure out my personal view on what could be the necessary formulation to realize

the possible formulations towards unied model on the lattice.

i found that the example of ising spin on the square lattice and dynamically

triangulated lattice are the most convincing examples of the following picture: a

regularized gravitational background can be generated by the dynamical triangula-

tion and the matter eld fermions can be generated by some degrees of freedom of

elds located on the simplexes of a simplicial manifold. lattice models of conformal

eld theories give many more varieties of the similar examples where matter central

charge c takes dierent values for dierent type of lattice models. one may wonder

it would be special case of two dimensional eld theory due to the conformal invari-

ance on the second order phase transition point of two dimensional lattice models.

i nd it is very natural to expect to have the similar mechanism working even in

higher dimensions.

it would be, however, very dicult to solve four dimensional

lattice models analytically while it was possible to solve two dimensional model

analytically and derive the corresponding conformal invariant continuum models.

as we have seen in the analyses of the fractal structure of quantum gravity,

numerical simulation played an important role.
in the two dimensional example
of c = 2 model theoretical and numerical analyses on the fractal dimension were
perfectly consistent. since we dont expect the solvability in higher dimensional

23

lattice gravity models with matter, numerical simulations may play an important

role again. in considering the present situation, the lattice qcd would be a good

example to nd analogy in the lattice gravity formulation. lattice qcd is not

solvable but is perfectly correct formulation of qcd even in non perturbative regime.

the lorentz invariance is lost but the gauge invariance was strictly kept in the nite

lattice regime.

we need to nd a gravitational counterpart of the lattice qcd formulation. in

three dimensions chern-simons gravity is formulated as a gauge theory. it would

be thus very instructive to nd lattice gravity formulation of chern-simons gravity.

as we show in the next section it is possible to formulate the chern-simons gravity

in analogy with wilsons lattice qcd formulation. what is surprising there is that

the continuum limit of the chern-simons gravity can be considered analytically with

the help of ponzano-regge model.

we nd it is instructive that the three dimensional gravity is formulated by

gauge theory of one form with chern-simons action. if one can formulate a gauge

theory in terms of forms, the general coordinate invariance is automatic. on the

other hand it is also very natural to expect that the gravity theory can very well

be formulated by a gauge theory. if we intend to formulate a lattice gravity theory

as a gauge theory we need to formulate gauge theory in terms of dierential forms.

furthermore dierential forms have very natural correspondence with simplexes on

the simplicial manifold. as we can see in g.10 the elds of dierential forms are

naturally put on the simplexes. we thus propose that the generalized gauge theory

which are formulated by dierential forms would be a good candidate to formulate

lattice gravity theory even with matter fermions, possibly dirac-kahler fermions,

which are also formulated by dierential forms[24][25].

3.2 generalized gauge theory

the generalized chern-simons actions, which were proposed by the present au-

thor and watabiki about ten years ago, is a generalization of the ordinary three-

dimensional chern-simons theory into arbitrary dimensions [6]. we summarize the

results in this section. the essential point of the generalization is to extend a one-

figure 10: dierential forms on the symplices

form gauge eld and zero-form gauge parameter to a quaternion valued generalized

gauge eld and gauge parameter which contain forms of all possible degrees. cor-

respondingly the standard gauge symmetry is extended to much higher topological

symmetry. these generalizations are formulated in such a way that the general-

ized actions have the same algebraic structure as the ordinary three-dimensional

chern-simons action.

since this generalized chern-simons action is formulated completely parallel to

the ordinary gauge theory, the generalization can be extended further to the topolog-

ical yang-mills action and generalized yang-mills actions of arbitrary dimensions.
in the most general form, a generalized gauge eld a and a gauge parameter v

are dened by the following component form:

a = 1 + i  + ja + k a,
v = 1a + ia + j + k,

(3.1)

(3.2)

where (, ), ( , ), (a, a) and ( a, a) are direct sums of fermionic odd forms,

fermionic even forms, bosonic odd forms and bosonic even forms, respectively, and

they take values on a gauge algebra. the bold face symbols 1, i, j and k satisfy the

25

algebra

12 = 1,
ij = ji = k,

j2 = 21, k2 = 121,

i2 = 11,
jk = kj = 2i, ki = ik = 1j,

(3.3)

where (1, 2) takes the value (1,1), (1, +1), (+1,1) or (+1, +1). throughout
this paper we adopt the convention (1, 2) = (1,1) unless otherwise stated, then
the above algebra corresponds to the quaternion algebra. the following graded lie

algebra can be adopted as a gauge algebra:

[ta, tb] = f c
[ta, ] = g
{, } = hc

abtc,

a,

tc,

(3.4)

where all the structure constants are subject to consistency conditions which follow

if we choose  = ta especially, this algebra

from the graded jacobi identities.
reduces to tatb = kc
abtc which is closed under multiplication. a specic example of
such algebra is realized by cliord algebra [38]. the components of the gauge eld
a and parameter v are assigned to the elements of the gauge algebra in a specic
way:

a = taaa,

 = ta a,  = ,
 =  ,

a =  a,
a = a.

(3.5)

a = taaa,  = taa,

an element having the same type of component expansion as a and v belong to
 and + class, respectively, and these elements fulll the following z2 grading
structure:

[+, +]  +,

[+, ]  ,

{, }  +,

where +  + and   . the elements of  and + can be regarded as gen-
eralizations of odd forms and even forms, respectively. in particular the generalized
exterior derivative which belongs to  is given by

q = jd,

(3.6)

and the following relations similar to the ordinary dierential algebra hold:

{q, } = q,

[q, +] = q+,

q2 = 0,

26

where +  + and   . to construct the generalized chern-simons actions,
we need to introduce two kinds of traces

tr[ta,  ] = 0,
str[ta,  ] = 0,

tr[,  ] = 0,
str{,  } = 0,

(3.7)

where (  ) in the commutators or the anticommutators denotes a product of gen-
erators. in particular (  ) should include an odd number of s in the last eq. of
(3.7). tr is the usual trace while str is the super trace satisfying the above relations.

these denitions of the traces are crucial to show that the generalized gauge the-

ory action can be invariant under the generalized gauge transformation presented

bellow.

as we have seen in the above the generalized gauge eld a and parameter v,
and the generalized dierential operator q play the same role as the one-form gauge

eld and zero-form gauge parameter and dierential operator of the usual gauge

theory, respectively. we can then construct generalized actions in terms of these

generalized quantities. we rst dene a generalized curvature

f  {q + a, q + a} = qa + a2.

(3.8)

we can construct generalized actions of chern-simons form, topological yang-

mills form and yang-mills form. they have the standard forms with respect to the

generalized quantities

1

3a3(cid:19) ,

sgcs = zm
sgy m = zm
sgy m = zm

2aqa +

tr(cid:18)1
tr (ff ) ,
tr (f  f ) ,

(3.9)

where  is generalized hodge star dened later. the product of the generalized elds
should be understood as wedge product. the generalized trace tr have several
types: tr = trq or tr = strq. trq(  ) and strq(  ) (q = 1, i, j, k) are dened
so as to pick up only the coecients of q from (  ) and take the traces dened by
eq.(3.7). the reason why we obtain the four dierent types of action is related to

the fact that the generalized actions in the trace are quaternion valued and thus

27

we should pick up particular combination in order to keep the generalized gauge

invariance.

for example the generalized chern-simons action 1

3a3, belongs to 
class and thus possesses the four dierent component types, the same types as in a
of (3.1). for example the k-th component of the generalized chern-simons action

2aqa + 1

is even dimensional bosonic component and thus the action

se

gcs =zm

trk(cid:18)1

2aqa +

1

3a3(cid:19)

(3.10)

is even dimensional bosonic action while j-th component of the generalized chern-

simons action is odd dimensional bosonic component and thus the action

so

gcs =zm

strj(cid:18)1

2aqa +

1

3a3(cid:19)

(3.11)

is odd dimensional bosonic action. it is also possible to obtain fermionic generalized

chern-simons actions by taking 1-th and i-th components. we then need to pick up

d-form terms to obtain d dimensional actions dened on a d-dimensional manifold

m. we can thus construct any dimensional generalized chern-simons actions.

on the other hand the generalized topological yang-mills action ff belongs
to + class and thus possesses the four dierent component types, the same types
as in v of (3.2). for example the 1-th component of the generalized topological
yang-mills action is even dimensional bosonic component and thus the action

sgy m =zm

str1 (ff )

(3.12)

is even dimensional bosonic action. we can similarly construct odd dimensional

bosonic action by taking i-th component of the generalized topological yang-mills

action.

important fact is that these generalized chern-simons actions and the topologi-

cal yang-mills actions are invariant under the following generalized gauge transfor-

mations:

a = [q + a,v],

(3.13)

where v is the generalized gauge parameter dened by eq.(3.2). it should be noted
that this symmetry is much larger than the usual gauge symmetry, in fact topological

28

symmetry, since the gauge parameter v contains as many gauge parameters as gauge
elds of various forms in a.

there is another suggestive topological nature due to the parallel construction

with the standard gauge theory. in ordinary gauge theory the integral for the n-th

power of the trace of curvature is called chern character and has topological nature.

in the generalized gauge theory it is possible to dene generalized chern character

which is expected to have topological nature related to generalized index theorem

str1(f n) = str1(q2n1),
tri(f n) = tri(q2n1),

(3.14)

(3.15)

where 2n1 is the generalized chern-simons forms. especially, for n = 2 case
in (3.14), we obtain the topological yang-mills type action of (3.12) related to the

generalized chern-simons action with one dimension lower on an even-dimensional

manifold m,

zm

str1f 2 =zm

str1 q(cid:16)aqa +

2

3a3(cid:17)!,

(3.16)

which has the same form of the standard relation.

in the case of the generalized yang-mills action the story is dierent. in order to

dene the generalized yang-mills action we need to dene the dual of the generalized

curvature by dening hodge star operation which breaks the gauge symmetry of the

higher forms as will be explained later. correspondingly the generalized yang-mills

action is not invariant under the generalized gauge transformation (3.13).

if we,

however, restrict to use the zero form gauge parameter then the action recovers gauge

invariance. it is, however, important to recognize that the generalized yang-mills

formulation is essentially the general realization of the non-commutative geometry

formulation of gauge theory `a la connes[39]. we can thus formulate the weinberg-

salam model by our generalized yang-mills action which will be explained later.

4 gravity on the lattice

29

4.1 first step towards the generalized chern-simons ac-

tions on the lattice

here we rst show the concrete expressions of generalized chern-simons actions in

two, three and four dimensions. for generalized gauge elds and parameters we

introduce the following notations:

a = ja + k a

 j( + ) + k( + b + 1h)

v = 1a + ia

 1(v + 1b + v ) + i(u + u),

(4.1)

(4.2)

where we have omitted the fermionic gauge elds ,  and gauge parameters ,  for

simplicity. here zero, one, two, three, four form gauge elds and gauge parameters

are denoted as , , b, , h and v, u, b, u, v , respectively.

by substituting eq.(4.1) into se

gcs of eq.(3.10) and eq.(3.11) and pick-
ing up two, three and four form part of the action, we can obtain more explicit

gcs and so

expressions of our generalized chern-simons actions in two, three and four dimen-

sions.

s2 = z tr{(d + 2) + 2b},
s3 = z str{
s4 = z tr{b(d + 2) + (d + {, }) + b2 + 2h}.

3  (db + [, b]) + 2},

these actions are invariant under the following gauge transformations:

 = [, v],

 = dv + [, v]  {, u},
b = du + {, u} + [b, v] + [, b],
 = db + [, b] + [, v]  {b, u} + {, u},
h = du  {, u} + {, u} + [h, v] + [b, b] + [, v ],

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

which are obtained by substituting eqs.(4.1) and (4.2)into the gneralized gauge trans-

formations (3.13).

30

equations of motion derived from the actions s2, s3 and s4 are

2 = 0,

d + [ ,  ] = 0,
d + 2 + {, b} = 0,
db + [ , b ] + [ ,  ] = 0,
d + {, } + b2 + {, h} = 0,

(4.7)

which are component-wise expressions of the vanishing generalized curvature f = 0
as equations of motion of the generalized chern-simons action, obtained by substi-

tuting (4.1) into (3.8).

classically we have already shown that gravity theories can be formulated by

using the generalized chern-simons actions of two, three and four dimensions. in

two dimensions sl(2, r) topological gravity formulated by verlinde and verlinde[40]

can be formulated as a local gauge theory of the generalized chern-simons action

by using cliord algebra[38]. in three dimensions the gravity theory formulated by

generalized chern-simons action with three dimensional super poincar`e algebra[41]

leads to the standard chern-simons gravity of einstein-hilbert action formulated by

witten[5]. thus classically three dimensional einstein gravity can be formulated by

both the standard chern-simons action and the generalized chern-simons action. in

four dimensions a topological conformal gravity can be formulated by the generalized

chern-simons action with conformal algebra[38]. in these analyses the zero form

gauge eld, as a classical solution of the equation motion, played a role of order

parameter of gravity phase. in other words the above mentioned gravity theories

are realized when the zero form part of the classical solution vanishes.

classically gravity theories in two, three and four dimensions are formulated by

the generalized chern-simons actions. we have recently shown that the quantization

of the generalized chern-simons actions can be carried out[43]. it turned out that

the quantization of the generalized chern-simons action is highly nontrivial due to

the innite reducibility of the theories. we will briey explain the formulation of

the quantization later. we thus know how to quantize the above mentioned gravity

theories.

31

since these gravity theories are formulated by the generalized chern-simons ac-

tions we naively expect that we may be able to formulate these gravity theories on the

simplicial lattice manifold by simply putting n-form gauge elds on the n-simplexes

of the manifold. the story is not so simple as we show the three dimensional example

in the following.

4.2 lattice chern-simons gravity

hereafter we concentrate on the three dimensional gravity since the formulation of

the three dimensional einstein gravity is established by the standard chern-simons

action. firstly it should be noted that the generalized chern-simons action includes

the standard chern-simons action as a part of the full action.

to make the story simpler we consider how to formulate the standard chern-

simons action, which is the part of the generalized chern-simons action composed

of one form only, on the simplicial manifold.

we consider a three-dimensional piece-wise linear simplicial manifold which is

composed of tetrahedra. in 3-dimensional regge calculus it is known that curvature

is concentrated on the links of tetrahedra[29]. we intend to formulate a lattice

gravity theory in terms of gauge variables, dreibein e and spin connection . in

analogy with the lattice gauge theory where link variables surrounding a plaquette

induce a gauge curvature, we have proposed the formulation that dual link variables
u(l) = e(l) located at the boundary of a dual plaquette p (l   p (l)) associated to
an original link l induce the curvature of the gravity theory [45][46]. it was further
pointed out that the dreibein ea(l) is located on the original link l.

in order to

avoid sign complications we consider a euclidean version of three-dimensional local

lorentz group so(3) but exclude su(2) case. here we explicitly construct a lattice

chern-simons gravity by extending our previous formulation. the details of the

formulation can be found in [44].

here we slightly modify the formulation given above in order that each tetrahe-

dron gets independent contribution to the partition function and at the same time

the orientability could be naturally accommodated. we divide the dual link, which

connects the centers of neighboring tetrahedra, into two links by the center of mass

figure 11: dual link variables on  p

of the common triangle of the neighboring tetrahedra. we may keep to use the

terminology of dual plaquette and dual link even for those modied plaquettes and

links. correspondingly we put dierent link variables u for the doubled dual links.

we then assign the directions of u-links inward for each tetrahedron as shown in

fig.11.

using these variables, we consider the following lattice version of iso(3) chern-

simons gravity action on the simplicial manifold,

slcs =xl

abcea(l)hln y p (l)

(cid:13) uibc

,

(4.8)

where,  p (l) is a boundary of the p (l), which is a (dual) plaquette around the link
(cid:13) u denotes the product of u(l) along  p (l). we dene the curvature

l, and y p (l)

f ab(l) of the link l by the following equation,

h y p (l)
(cid:13) uiab

hef (l)iab

.

(4.9)

the leading term of f with respect to the lattice unit is the ordinary curvature
d +    similar to the ordinary lattice gauge theory.

33

classically the chern-simons action impose a torsion free condition as an equa-

tion of motion. the torsion free nature is lost at the quantum level since we integrate

out the dreibein and spin connection. we now introduce the following vanishing

holonomy constraint which relates the dreibein and spin connection even at the

quantum level:

h y p (l)
(cid:13) uiab

eb = ea.

(4.10)

the dreibein ea associated to a original link may be parallel transported around the
boundary of the dual plaquette  p (l) to the original location and yet the direction

of the dreibein should not be changed. we may interpret this constraint as a gauge

xing condition of gauge dieomorphism symmetry which we will explain later. due

to the constraint the group so(3) becomes eectively abelian, i.e. the direction
of the rotation associated with the curvature is parallel to that of ea. this can be

seen as follows: we can reduce the above constraint to the following one:

f abeb = 0,

(4.11)

here we should reconsider the constraint (4.10). firstly it should be noted

is an element of so(3) and thus the eigenvalue equation of this

hence f a  1
that the h y p (l)

2abcf bc is parallel to ea: ea  f a.
(cid:13) uiab

element always has eigenvalue +1. thus the number of the independent constraints

in eq.(4.10) is not three but two. taking into account the parallel and anti-parallel
nature of ea and f a in the constraint, we can rewrite the correct constraint equation

e3

|f|

+

ea

|e|! +

2ya=1

  f a
|f| 

ea

|e|!# ,

(4.12)

where |e| and |f| are length of ea and f a, respectively. the coecient factor e3
|e|
necessary to keep the rotational invariance of the constraint relation, which can be

is

easily checked by polar coordinate expression of the constraint relation.

now we show that discreteness of the length of the dreibein |e| comes out as a
natural consequence of the specic choice of the lattice gauge gravity action. we

rst introduce the following normalized matrix i,

i  i aja,

i a 

f a

f afa

,

34

(4.13)

here [ja]bc = iabc is the generator of so(3). this matrix satises the following

relation,

then

eii = 1  i 2(1  cos ) + ii sin ,

ei2ni = 1, n  z.

(4.14)

(4.15)

using the above relation and f a  ea by the constraint (4.10), we nd that our
lattice chern-simons action slcs has the following ambiguity:

abcea(l)hln ef (l)ibc
abcea(l)hln ef (l)+i2niibc
[2ea(l)fa(l) + 4n|e(l)|]

slcs = xl
= xl
= xl
= slcs +xl

4n|e(l)|,

here |e| is the length of ea, |e|  eaea. this ambiguity leads to an ambiguity in

the partition function

z =z dude eislcs =z dude eislcs+ipl 4n|e|.

(4.16)

imposing the single valuedness of eislcs, we obtain the constraint that pl 2|e(l)|
should be integer, or equivalently |e(l)| should be half integer.

4.2.1 gauge invariance on the lattice

the gauge transformations of the continuum chern-simons gravity have been given

by (2.52) which includes the local lorentz gauge transformation (2.53) and the

gauge transformation of dieomorphism (2.54). we rst note that the dreibein and

the curvature dened in (2.51) transform adjointly under the local lorentz gauge

transformation

ea
 = abcebc,
 = abcf b
c.

f a

(4.17)

we consider that the lattice version of the local lorentz gauge parameters are

sitting on the dual sites and the middle of the original links, the same point of the

35

dreibein. for simplicity we consider here in this section that the dual link is not

divided into two dual links by the center of original triangle. then the dual link
variable u(l) = e(l) transforms under the lattice local lorentz transformation as

u(l)  v 1u(l)v ,

(4.18)

where the gauge parameters v and v  are elements of so(3) and located at the end
points of dual link l. dening the matrix form of the dreibein by ecb
 (l) = abcea(l),

we can rewrite the lattice chern-simons action (4.8) by

tr(e(l)f (l)),

(4.19)

slcs =xl

.

where f (l)ab =hln y p (l)

(cid:13) uiab

corresponding to the continuum local lorentz transformation, we can dene the

lattice version of local lorentz transformation of e(l) and f (l) according to (4.18)

e(l)  v 1e(l)v,
f (l)  v 1f (l)v.

(4.20)

it is obvious that the lattice chern-simons action (4.19) is invariant under the lattice

local lorentz transformation.

the continuum chern-simons gravity action is invariant under the gauge trans-

formation of dieomorphism (2.54) which transforms dreibein ea
nection a

 but not spin con-
. we can show that the lattice chern-simons action is invariant under the
lattice version of gauge dieomorphism by formulating the lattice version of bianchi

identity[44].

we now point out that the constraint (4.10) or equivalently (4.11) breaks the

lattice gauge dieomorphism while the lattice chern-simons action itself is invariant,

as is shown above. the lattice dreibein is transformed but the lattice curvature is

not transformed under the lattice gauge transformation of the dieomorphism. the
precise expression of the constraint (4.12) tells us that the dreibein ea can be rotated

by using two gauge parameters of the gauge transformation of dieomorphism to be
parallel or anti-parallel to the curvature f a. the length of the dreibein is discretized

and thus the third gauge parameter can be exhausted. in this sense we can identify

36

the equivalent constraint, (4.10), (4.11), (4.12) as a gauge xing condition of the

lattice gauge transformation of dieomorphism.

4.2.2 calculation of partition function

in the previous section we have found that the length of dreibein is discretized to

half integer for so(3). taking into account the discreteness of the dreibein, the

total partition function leads

zl,

z = z duyl

,

where zl is the partition function associated with a link l.

4.2.2.1 e integration

due to the rotational invariance of the constraints, we can take e3 as the third
direction of local lorentz frame without loss of generality. we can then evaluate ea

integral of zl immediately thanks to the delta functions

j (eiaja) = j (||) =

where || is the length of a, we nd

sin(cid:16)(2j + 1)||
2(cid:17)
sin(cid:16)||2(cid:17)

,

j (|f|)  j1(|f|) = 2 cos(j|f|).

37

(4.23)

(4.24)

this calculation is not precise, because the summation is not convergent. we need

to show that there is a regularization procedure which leads to a validity of the

above calculation after the regularization.

it is possible to give the similar formulation by using heat kernel regularization.

then the action leads

zl = 

1

8xj

(2j + 1)j ej(j+1)t.

(4.25)

this regularization factor ej(j+1)t breaks the alexander move invariance of the

partition function but it will be recovered at the end of the calculation when we
take the limit t  0.

4.2.2.2 u integration

after ea integration and dividing the unimportant constant factorql(1/8), the

partition function leads

z =z duyl

xj=0

(2j + 1) j(cid:16) y p (l)

(cid:13) u(cid:17) ej(j+1)t,

(4.26)

where we take t  0 limit in the end of calculation. we now carry out du integra-
tion of this partition function. thanks to the character of the partition function,

du integration is straightforward. we show that the ponzano-regge partition func-

tion will be reproduced after du integration with 6-j symbols together with correct

coecients and sign factors.

before getting into the details we gure out how 6-j symbols appear. the char-

acter in the partition function is a product of d-function around the boundary of

dual plaquette associated to a original link. each tetrahedron has six original links

and there are two dual links which is a part of a product on the boundary of the dual

plaquette associated to each original link. in other words three dual links associated

38

to a du integration thrust into each triangle from the center of the tetrahedron.

therefore twelve dual links are associated to a tetrahedron. each du integration of

the product of three d-function reproduces two 3-j symbols, thus we get eight 3-j

symbols for each tetrahedron. four out of eight 3-j symbols lead to a 6-j symbol

and the rest of four 3-j symbols lead to give a trivial factor together with the 3-j

symbols from the neighboring tetrahedra.

we rst note that the character appearing in the partition function is a product

of d-functions

j (|f|) = j(cid:16) y p (l)

(cid:13) u(cid:17) = dj

m1m2(u1)dj

m2m3(u2)    dj

mkm1(uk),

(4.27)

where ui is a dual link variables on the boundary of dual plaquette p (l) associated
to a link l and mi is the third component of angular momentum j which is assigned

to the link l. as we have already pointed out that the direction of ui for each

link is dened inward for each tetrahedron. on the other hand the direction of the

loop composed of the product of dual links associated to the link l can be chosen
arbitrarily. therefore some of ui in the above d-functions are ui . if the original
link l is a link of a particular tetrahedron, two d-functions out of the above product

are located inside the tetrahedron.

we now choose a particular situation which is shown in fig.12. the twelve

d-functions associated to this particular tetrahedron are

figure 12: dual links related to neighboring tetrahedra and the orientability

we can now use the formula relating the integration of three d-functions and two

we now use the formula given in (2.64) which relates 6-j symbol and four 3-j symbols

which carry mi suces associated to the center of the tetrahedron. we then nd

6-j symbols after du1du2du3du4 integration

(4.31)

here we are considering so(3) case then the third component of the angular
momentum mi is integer and thus we can use the relation ()mi = ()mi. we now
look at the rest of the 3-j symbols in eq.(4.31) which carry the suces i, j, k, l. as

we can see from fig.12 that du1 integration reproduces two 3-j symbols and one of

them associated to the suces mk is absorbed to reproduce the 6-j symbol and the

other 3-j symbol carrying the suces ik could be combined with another 3-j symbol
obtained from du1 integrations of the neighboring tetrahedron. those 3-j symbols
are associated to the boundary triangle of the two neighboring tetrahedra carrying

sux ik. in this particular case of fig.12 we obtain the following two 3-j symbols

i b

i = xi1i2i3

()i1+i2+i3  j1 j2 j3

i1 i2 i3!  j1 j2 j3
i1 i2 i3! .

since the three angular momentum vectors j1, j2, j3 construct the boundary trian-
gle, the third components satisfy the relation i1  i2  i3 = 0. using the following
formula:

xm1m2m3  j1 j2 j3

m1 m2 m3!  j1 j2 j3

m1 m2 m3! = 1,

(4.32)

and noting ()i1+i2+i3 = ()i1i2i3 = 1 for so(3) case, these two 3-j symbols lead
to a trivial factor. thus all the terms together lead to the ponzano-regge partition

function.

4.2.3 the continuum limit of the lattice chern-simons gravity

we have explicitly shown that the partition function of the iso(3) lattice chern-

simons action exactly coincides with the ponzano-regge model after the integration

of the dreibein and the dual link variables. the discreteness of the length of the

dreibein is the natural consequence of the logarithm form in the lattice chern-simons

action. on the simplicial lattice manifold constructed from tetrahedra, the drei beins

are located on the original links while the lattice version of the spin connection, the

dual link variables are located on the dual links.

41

since the ponzano-regge model is invariant under the 2-3 and 1-4 alexander

moves, the partition function is invariant under how the three dimensional space is

divided into small pieces by tetrahedra. it is natural to expect that the partition

function is invariant in the continuum limit and thus the lattice chern-simons action

leads to the continuum chern-simons action.

in the iso(3) lattice chern-simons action there are 6 gauge parameters. two

gauge parameters of the lattice gauge dieomorphism can be used to rotate the
dreibein ea to be parallel or anti-parallel to the curvature f a and the remaining

one gauge parameter of the lattice gauge dieomorphism can be exhausted to make

the length of the dreibein discrete. there remain three gauge parameters of the

lattice local lorentz gauge symmetry, which are expected to convert into the three

vector parameters of general coordinate dieomorphism symmetry. there are two

reasons to expect this scenario. firstly the lattice action coincides with the ponzano-

regge model which is alexander move invariant and is thus expected to be metric

independent.

in fact the lattice chern-simons action in the continuum limit is

metric independent since it is composed of one form. secondly the general coordinate

transformation of dieomorphism and the local lorentz transformation are on shell

equivalent in the continuum iso(3) chern-simons gravity[5].

it is interesting to recognize that the drei bein and spin connection are located

on the original and dual links, respectively. this geometrical dual nature will be the

reection of the algebraic dual nature of the iso(3) chern-simons gravity where

the abelian momentum generators pa and the angular momentum generator ja are

algebraically dual to each other[42].

5 quantization of generalized gauge theory

since the generalized gauge theory has nontrivial algebraic structures, we need to

understand the origin of these algebras. for example the quaternion structure plays

a very crucial role to treat the generalized elds and parameters in a uniform way.

we expected that the quaternion structure will be essentially related with the al-

gebraic structure of the quantization of the theories. this expectation has turned

out to be true. we found several other interesting features of the generalized gauge

42

theory in the quantization procedure. here in this section we briey summarize how

to quantize the generalized chern-simons action[43]. in particular we concentrate

on the quantization of even dimensional generalized chern-simons actions. to be

concrete for the notations we focus on the four dimensional case here. the details

of the quantization of two dimensional model is given in [43]. the extension to odd

dimensions goes quite parallel to the even dimensional case.

we consider to quantize the even dimensional generalized chern-simons action

3a3(cid:19),

(5.1)

where the explicit component wise notations for the classical gauge elds and gauge

parameters are given in (4.1) and (4.2).

an important characteristic of the generalized chern-simons action is the innite

reducibility of the action which can be stated as follows. we extend the generalized
gauge eld and parameter to accommodate the ghost and the ghost for ghost    as

v2n = j (u2n + u2n) + k (v2n + b2n + v2n)  ,

v2n+1 = 1 (v2n+1 + b2n+1 + v2n+1)  i (u2n+1 + u2n+1)  +,

(5.2)

(5.3)

n = 0, 1, 2,   ,

where v0  a and v1  v and the parameters with n (> 1) correspond the n-th
reducibility parameters. the innite reducibility of the generalized chern-simons
actions can be seen by the transformation of vn
vn = ()n[ q + a , vn+1 ]()n+1,

n = 0, 1, 2,  

(5.4)

which satises the on-shell relation

(vn) = vn(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)vn+1vn+1+vn+1  vn

= 0,

(5.5)

where we have used the equation of motion of generalized chern-simons action. in
the above equations, [ , ]()n is a commutator for odd n and an anticommutator for
even n. since the transformation (5.4) for n = 0 represents the gauge transformation,

eq.(5.5) implies that the gauge transformation is innitely reducible.

43

in order to quantize this kind of system we need to introduce innite series of

ghosts as generalized elds

n = 0,1,2,   ,,

where the index n indicates the ghost number of the elds and the elds with even

(odd) ghost number are bosonic (fermionic). the elds with ghost number 0 are the

classical elds

c0 = , c0 = , c0 = b, c0 = , c0 = h.

then we redene a generalized gauge eld

ea = 1 + i  + ja + k a  ,

4!

c2n+1dx  dx  dx  dx(cid:17),

where we have explicitly shown the dierential form dependence.

using the above denitions of generalized gauge elds, we dene the following

extended generalized action which has the same form as the original one

smin =z tr0

k(cid:18)1
2 eaq ea +

1

3 ea3(cid:19),

(5.8)

where the upper index 0 on tr indicates to pick up only the part with ghost number

0. we can then show that this action satises the master equation of antibracket

formalism `a la batalin and vilkovisky[47].

in the construction of batalin and vilkovisky, ghosts, ghosts for ghosts   and the
corresponding antields are introduced according to the reducibility of the theory.
we denote a minimal set of elds by a which include classical elds and ghost

44

elds, and the corresponding antields by a. if a eld has ghost number n, its
antield has ghost number n  1. then a minimal action is obtained by solving
the master equation

(smin(, ), smin(, )) = 0,

(x, y ) =

where s0 is the classical action and z an
an+1an+1 represents the n-th reducibility trans-
formation where the reducibility parameters are replaced by the corresponding ghost

elds.

the brst transformation and the nilpotency of the transformation can be shown

by using generalized elds

 ea  s ea = ef i,

s2 ea21  21 ea = [ q + ea , ef ]21 = 0,

where the last relation holds due to the generalized bianchi identity. we can then

show that smin satises the master equation

smin = (smin, smin),k = (smin, smin)   = 0,

where ( , ) is the original antibracket dened by (5.9) with the following identica-

tions of antields:

c2n = c 2n1,

c2n = c

c2n = c 
2n1 .

(5.13)

45

in order to x gauge completely we need to introduce the non-minimal action

with the proper choice of gauge fermion. we can then eliminate the antields via

the chosen gauge fermion. we just mention here that all these procedures can be

completed properly[43]. we can thus complete the quantization of the generalized

chern-simons action in even dimensions.

6 generalized yang-mills theory

interesting applications of the generalized gauge theory would be to nd the realistic

correspondence with the known formulations. needless to say that the yang-mills

action has been playing a crucial role to describe the three out of four fundamental

forces of our nature and may play again an important role in describing unied

theory of all the four fundamental forces including gravity.

here in this section we concretely show that the generalized yang-mills ac-

tion is fundamentally related to the super symmetry and interpretation of matter

fermions[48] and non-commutative geometry formulation of gauge theory[49].

6.1 generalized topological yang-mills theory

in this subsection we analyze the two dimensional version of the generalized topo-

logical yang-mills action and show that the instanton gauge xing of the generalized

topological yang-mills action leads to a n = 2 super yang-mills theory together

with the twisting procedure. in four dimensions witten showed that a topological

gauge theory having n = 2 super symmetry leads to the n = 2 super yang-mills

theory with the twisting procedure[50]. later it has been pointed out that the

n = 2 super yang-mills theory with the twisting procedure can be derived from the

topological yang-mills action with instanton gauge xing[51]. this subject has been

intensively investigated [52] in particular the twisting mechanism has been cleared

up in two dimensions with the help of super conformal eld theory[53].

our formulation of this section[48] is the two dimensional realization of the known

four dimensional scenario and can be extended to arbitrary dimensions.

to make the formulation concrete and simpler we specify to the two dimen-

sional case. as we have already mentioned that the action we consider satises the

46

following well known relation:

zm

str1f 2

0 =zm

str1 q(cid:16)a0qa0 +

0(cid:17)!,
2
3a3

(6.1)

where a0 and f0 are the two dimensional counter part of the generalized classical
gauge eld and curvature. more explicitly they are given by

a0 = j + k(cid:16) + b(cid:17)
f0 = qa0 + a2

0

 ,

= 1(cid:16)d + 2 + {, b} + 2(cid:17) + i(cid:16)d + [, ](cid:17)

(6.2)

(6.3)

(6.4)

 +.

due to the topological nature of the action, i.e., the action vanishes identically

if the two dimensional manifold m does not have boundary, the action has so called

shift symmetry. in other words the action is invariant under the gauge transforma-
tion of an arbitrary function e0. thus the gauge transformation of the generalized
topological yang-mills action has the following form:

a0 = [q + a0,v0] + e0,

(6.5)

(6.6)

(6.7)

where v0 is the generalized gauge parameter
v0 = 1(cid:16)v + b(cid:17) + iu
e0 = j(1) + k(cid:16)(0) + (2)(cid:17)

 +,

 ,

while e0 is a new gauge parameter of the shift symmetry and is given by

where (0), (1) and (2) are zero-, one- and two form bosonic gauge parameters,

respectively. at this stage the readers may wonder why we should keep the original
gauge transformation in the gauge transformation of a0 in (6.5) since the gauge
parameter of the shift symmetry e0 is an arbitrary function and could absorb the
it will turn out later that both of
change of the original gauge transformation.

the shift symmetry and the original symmetry are essential to induce n = 2 super

symmetry with matter fermions via twisting procedure.

the generalized topological action has the following obvious reducibility:

v0 = v1,
e0 = [q + a0,v1].

47

(6.8)

thus this system is a rst stage reducible system in the terminology of batalin and

vilkovisky. correspondingly we need to introduce ghost elds c (n) and ec (n) with
respect to the gauge parameters v0 and e0, and ghost for ghost eld (n) with respect
to v1 , respectively. here the sux (n) with n = 0, 1, 2 denotes the form degree.

we then redene the generalized gauge eld by introducing the ghost eld c (n)

a = 1c (1) + i(cid:16)c (0) + c (2)(cid:17) + j + k(cid:16) + b(cid:17)

 .

(6.9)

we need to introduce another generalized eld to accommodate the ghost of the

shift symmetry ec (n) and ghost for ghost (n)

c = 1(cid:16)(0) + (2)(cid:17) + i(1) + j(cid:16)ec (0) + ec (2)(cid:17) + kec (1)

 +.

(6.10)

here c belongs + and could be identied as a part of generalized curvature later.
furthermore we extend the dierential operator q by introducing the brst

operator s as a fermionic zero-form

q  q + qb = jd + is,

 .

(6.11)

it should be noted that s commutes with d, i.e. [d, s] = 0 and s2 = 0. this operator

satises the nilpotency property because of quaternionic structures

q2 = 0.

(6.12)

the following graded leibnitz rule acting on generalized gauge elds a,b   can
be derived:

q(ab) = (qa)b + ()|a|a(qb),

(6.13)

where |a| = 0 for a  + and |a| = 1 for a  .

we can now dene the generalized curvature by using the redened gauge eld

f = qa + a2
= f0 + c,

(6.14)

where the second relation is imposed to relate the brst transformation of the

components elds. the nilpotency of the brst transformation is assured by the

bianchi identity of the generalized eld

qf + [a,f ] = 0.

48

(6.15)

the component wise expressions of brst transformation can be read from (6.14)

and (6.15).

6.1.1

instanton gauge fixing of topological yang-mills model

we next introduce a particular model to carry out explicit analyses. in particular

we choose the cliord algebra as a graded lie algebra, which closes under the

multiplication and is simplest nontrivial example. more specically we take the

following two dimensional antihermitian euclidean cliord algebra:

t a : 1,

5,

 : a,

(6.16)

abab = i3
where a = (i1, i2), which satisfy {a, b} = 2ab and 5 =
with 12 = 1. a grading generator can be identied by 5 and then we dene the

1
2

super trace

the two dimensional generalized topological yang-mills action leads

str(  ) = tr(5   ).

s0 =

1

2zm
str1f 2
0 ,
= zm
d2x(cid:16)f||2 + ab(d)a(d)b(cid:17)
= zm
d2x (cid:16)2||2 + abab(cid:17),

(6.17)

where the scalar part of the one-form eld s and the two form eld ba do not

appear in the action. it can be seen from the above relation that the square of the

generalized curvature is related to the one dimensional generalized chern-simons

action with the particular choice of the graded lie algebra.

we can now nd out a two dimensional instanton relation of our generalized

topological yang-mills action by imposing self- (anti-self-) dual condition

in the present model we take the following duality relation for the gauge algebra

 f0 = f0.

(6.18)

and the quaternions

 1 = 5,

bb,

5 = 1,

a = a
49

1 = 1,

i = i.

(6.19)

we can then nd the following minimal condition of the action leading to instanton

relations:

1

1

=

2z str1f0  f0 +
2z str1f0  f0

4z str1(cid:16)f0  f0(cid:17)  (cid:16)f0  f0(cid:17)
1
= z d2x (cid:16)1

2
1

f  ||2(cid:17)(cid:16)1
2(cid:16)(d)a  

a

f  ||2(cid:17)
b(d)b(cid:17)(cid:16)(d)a  

2

+

a

c(d)c(cid:17)!.

(6.20)

then the instanton condition is the absolute minima of the generalized yang-mills

action

f  ||2 = 0,

we now derive the gauge xed action with instanton relations as gauge xing

conditions together with the following landau type gauge xing condition for the

ec  = 0.

(6.23)

we introduce a set of antighost elds , a,  and c, and lagrange multipliers,

e, a,  and . these elds obey the standard brst subalgebra

where  and  are arbitrary parameters. in the second line of (6.25) brst trans-

formations of the component elds from (6.24), (6.14) and (6.15) are used.

6.1.2 twisted n = 2 super yang-mills action with dirac- kahler fermions

we now modify the gauge xed action sg-f of (6.25) by adding brst exact terms

and making the action hermite and taking the particular choice of the parameters

 and

(6.26)

it is easy to see that the kinetic terms of a, ec, , , a and eca are nondegenerate

while that of  is degenerate. indeed this action is invariant under the following

so(2) gauge transformations with a gauge parameter v,

gauge = v,

gauge(a, eca, a) = 2va
gauge(ec, , , , ) = 0.

b(b, ecb, b),

51

(6.27)

we claim that this action possesses brst symmetry and n = 2 twisted su-

per algebra up to the above gauge symmetry. the algebra will be summarized

for fermionic family of scalar brst generator s and the vector and pseudo-scalar

counterpart s and es as follows:

s2 = igauge,

{s, s} = 2i  2igauge,
{s, s} = 2iggauge,
{es, s} = 2i
{es,es} = 2igauge,
{es, s} = 0.

(6.35)

the more detailed conrmation of the component wise expressions for the twisted

n = 2 super algebra is given in ([48]).

in this formulation we nd out very interesting and nontrivial correspondence.

we point out that the fermionic elds corresponding to ghosts and lagrange mul-

tipliers can be interpreted as dirac-kahler fermion elds and thus the twisting pro-

cedure is nothing but the dirac-kahler interpretation of fermionic elds appearing

in the quantization procedure.

the kinetic terms of multiplet (, ec, ) and (eca, a) in the action (6.26) can

be expressed as

s = z d2x(iec   iec  iaeca)
= z d2xtr(cid:16)i + i(cid:17),

where we denote   22 (a + b) and   1
22(a  b). it should be noted that
the gauge transformation on dirac-kahler eld  can be recognized as so(2) avor

(6.36)

group.

as we have seen in the formulation, the fermionic elds appearing in the quanti-

zation procedure such as ghosts and lagrange multiplier turns into the dirac-kahler

matter fermion.

it would be important to conrm algebraically that the dirac-

kahler fermions transform as spinor elds and posses half integer spin unlike the

ghost elds.

usually n = 2 super algebra includes the generator r corresponding to a con-

served current r associated with r-symmetry. the procedure of the topological

twist is related with the redenition of the stress tensor t. we can dene new
stress tensor t  by the following relation without spoiling current conservation law
of r,

t  = t + r + r.

(6.37)

this modication of the stress tensor leads to a redenition of the lorentz rotation

generator j

j = j + r.

(6.38)

this rotation group is interpreted as the diagonal subgroup of so(2)  so(2)i. in
other words the topological twist is essentially achieved by identifying spinor and

isospinor indices.

in the present model we can identify the transformation of the r-symmetry is

the transformation of the avor symmetry for the dirac-kahler fermion elds

r = (cid:16) 1

2

5(cid:17),

r = (cid:16) 1

2

5(cid:17).

53

(6.39)

then the lorentz transformation induced by the generator j is

j  = 

1

[5, ],

while the lorentz transformation of j is

j  =

2

5.

(6.40)

(6.41)

we can obtain the same relations for . this implies that dirac-kahler fermion

elds exactly transform as spinors and carry spin one half.

6.2 weinberg-salam model from generalized gauge the-

ory

connes has pointed out that the weinberg-salam model can be formulated as a

particular case of the noncommutative geometry formulation of a gauge theory[39].

roughly speaking his idea is the following. consider a manifold which is composed

of a direct product of discrete two points and four dimensional at space and dene

a connection and dierential operator on this manifold. due to the discrete nature

of the two points the dierential operator can be represented by two by two matrix.

thus the connection or equivalently the gauge eld is now represented by two by two

matrix and thus possesses diagonal and o-diagonal components. then the weak

and electromagnetic one form gauge elds are assigned to the diagonal component

while the zero form higgs elds are assigned to the o-diagonal components. then

the spontaneously broken weinberg-salam model comes out naturally from the pure
yang-mills action by taking the group su(2)  u(1)[39][54].

6.2.1 generalized gauge theory with dirac-kahler fermions

in this subsection we show that the two by two matrix representation of the gauge

elds are easily accommodated by the quaternions of the generalized gauge eld

since the quaternion algebra can be represented by two by two matrices. we can,

however, point out that our generalized gauge theory is more general formulation

as noncommutative geometry since it includes not only zero and one form of gauge

elds but also all the possible form degrees of gauge elds[49].

54

in formulating generalized yang-mills action we need to dene the inner product

to construct the action. in the sense of the generalized topological yang-mills theory

the inner product has been dened by the naive wedge product. here we intend to

incorporate fermionic form degrees of freedom in accordance with the generalized

gauge eld. we then formulate the fermionic form degrees by dirac-kahler fermion

formulation to generate matter fermions. we thus need to dene a new inner product

to accommodate both the generalized gauge elds and dirac-kahler elds.

we keep to use the generalized gauge eld and parameter as dened above in

(4.1) and (4.2). in addition we introduce fermionic matter generalized eld

 = 1 + i   
 = j + k  +,

(6.42)

where  and  fermionic odd forms while  and  are fermionic even forms. we
now extend the generalized dierential operator q = jd into

d = jd + km,

(6.43)

where m is a bosonic constant matrix. in this subsection we consider the formulation

only in four dimensions.

it is straightforward to generalize the formulation into

arbitrary even dimensions.

this dierential operator has the following grading structure:

da = { d, a }, a  ,
dv = [ d, v ], v  +.

(6.44)

(6.45)

the graded leibniz rule can be easily checked, but the nilpotency is not satised in
general: d2 = 1m2. the gauge transformation of the generalized curvature has
extra factor due to the non-nilpotency of the dierential operator

f = [ f , v ] + [ d2, v ]
= [ f , v ]  [ m2, v ].

(6.46)

in order to dene generalized yang-mills action with dirac-kahler fermions as
matter we introduce the notion of cliord product or simply cup product  which

55

was introduced by kahler and should be dierentiated from the wedge product
[24][25]. we consider an element u which is the direct sum of forms

u =

1
p!

mxp=0

u1pdx1      dxp,

where m  d with d as spacetime dimension.

we then dene the linear operator e,

eu =

m1xp=0

1
p!

u1pdx1      dxp,

(6.47)

(6.48)

which is understood as a dierentiation of the polynomial of dierential form with
respect to dx. in particular it has the role of contracting operator as

edx1  dx2  dx3  dx4    

= g1

+ g3

 dx2  dx3  dx4      g2
 dx1  dx2  dx4      g4

 dx1  dx3  dx4    
 dx1  dx2  dx3     +    .(6.49)

we further dene sign operators  and  which generate the following sign factors:

p(p1)

2 up

up = pup  (1)
up = (1)pup,

(6.50)

where up is a p-form variable.

we can now dene the cup (cliord) product of u and v

u  v =

1
p!

mxp=0

p{p(e1    epu)}  e1    epv,

(6.51)

where v has the similar form as u in (6.47). the sign factor p and the operator p
are necessary to conrm the associativity of the cup product

(u  v)  w = u  (v  w).

we introduce the generalized yang-mills action

sg =z tr[  (d + a) + f  f ]1  1

56

(6.52)

(6.53)

where  is hodge star operator and in particular 1 = g 1
4! 1234dx1  dx2 
dx3  dx4 in four dimensions with g as the metric determinant. the simbol 1
denotes to pick up the coecient of 1 for the quaternion expansion in the trace.

we then dene the generalized gauge parameter

v = 1v,

(6.54)

where v is 0-form gauge parameter and thus v  +. this has a clear contrast with
the generalized gauge parameter of generalized chern-simons formulation where all

the degrees of dierential forms were introduced.

we now claim that the generalized yang-mills action with dirac-kahler matter

fermion is gauge invariant under the following gauge transformation:

a = [d + a,v],
 = v  ,
 =   v,

(6.55)

where we have used the notation [a,b] = a b b a. here we should mention
that in the quaternion algebra we should choose the sign choice (1, 2) = (1, 1) to

prove the generalized gauge invariance of the generalized yang-mills action (6.53).

6.2.2 weinberg-salam model from generalized gauge theory as non-

commutative geometry formulation

in the formulation of previous subsection we have introduced all the degrees of

dierential forms but only zero form for the generalized gauge parameter. the

reason why we have introduced only zero form gauge parameter is that the action is

not gauge invariant under the higher form gauge parameters. hereafter we introduce

only zero form and one form gauge elds for the generalized gauge eld and do not

consider the dirac-kahler fermionic matter for simplicity.

we take the algebra of super group su(2|1) as the graded lie algebra. su(2|1)

generators can be represented by 3  3 matrices [54]

with t = 12(t1it2). t3, y correspond to a generator of a weak isospin and a weak
hypercharge, respectively. this algebra contains su(2)  u(1)y in the even graded
parts ti, y , and su(2) doublet in the odd graded parts , 
 whose subscripts 
correspond to the generators with eigenvalues  1
2 of the generator t3. indeed higgs
doublet which we have introduced as lie algebra valued gauge elds corresponds to
these odd parts. it is interesting to note that the super symmetric algebra of su(2|1)
can be accommodated in the generalized gauge theory even without fermionic elds.

the gauge eld is now expanded by corresponding elds of the generators

a = j(cid:16)iaiti +

i
23

by(cid:17) + k(cid:16) i
2

(6.56)

where ai, b and 0, + are real su(2)u(1)y gauge elds and complex higgs scalar
elds respectively. we can choose a particular form of the constant matrix m of the
generalized dierential operator m = i2(v+ + v

) which leads

v spontaneously break down to the special direction which is required from the

consistency of the extended dierential algebras.

higgs potential term can be minimized by shifting the eld with y =  1
to the ratio of the mass of physical higgs m and weak boson mw to m
mw

the predictions from this scheme agree with noncommutative geometric mod-

els [39][54]. this model has fewer parameters than the usual weinberg-salam model

and has predictive power on the higgs mass.

7 possible scenario and conjectures for unied

model on the lattice

i would like to discuss a possible scenario and then propose conjectures of unied

model on the lattice based on the analyses of previous sections and suggestive known

results.

constructive and reguralized quantum theory of gravity will be given by dynam-

ically triangulated simplicial lattice manifold. in two dimensional quantum gravity

we have enough evidences that this is the fact and we have the analytical and numer-

ical formulations to describe it. as we have seen in the three dimensional example of

chern-simons gravity the lattice manifold may be interpreted as spin graph where

links carry the quantum numbers of angular momentum. two dimensional topolog-

ical gravity has similar nature as the chern-simons gravity where links may carry

conformal spin quantum numbers[40]. in four dimensional lattice gravity formula-

tions there are similar evidences[34][35][36].

gauge theory formulation of the lattice gravity and matter will be formulated

by the generalized gauge theory. in other words the generalized gauge theory for-

mulated by dierential forms may play a crucial role in formulating a lattice gravity

since the dieomorphism invariance is automatic in the formulation of dierential

forms. furthermore dierential forms and simplexes have one to one correspondence

and thus the elds on the forms can naturally be put on the corresponding simplexes.

quaternion algebra may play a crucial role in the formulation of the lattice

gravity formulated by the generalized gauge theory.

in other words even forms,

odd forms, fermions and bosons are the fundamental algebraic ingredients which are

nicely classied by the quaternion algebra. furthermore the graded lie algebra will

be another fundamental algebra which governs the gauge structure of the generalized

gauge theory, in particular, the super symmetry. thus the semi-direct product of

the graded lie algebra and the quaternion algebra is the fundamental structure of

the generalized gauge theory and may play an important role in formulating lattice

gravity as a gauge theory.

fermionic matter will be generated from the ghosts of quantization by the twist.

the twisting procedure is essentially related with the dirac kahler fermion formu-

61

lation as we have shown in the quantization of topological yang-mills action. the

fermionic ghosts appear as fermionic dierential forms and can be put on the sim-

plicial lattice similar as the bosonic elds. we need to understand this twisting

mechanism from lattice point of view.

as we have seen in the quantization of the generalized chern-simons actions we

needed to introduce innite number of ghosts due to the innite reducibility of the

system[43]. it is interesting to consider possible physical aspects of the introduction

of an innite number of the ghost elds. an immediate consequence is a democracy

of ghosts and classical elds, i.e., the classical elds are simply the zero ghost number

sector among innitely many ghost elds and thus the classical gauge elds and ghost

elds have no essential dierence in the minimal action.

furthermore fermionic and bosonic gauge elds are treated in an equal footing

and the series of innite ghosts originated from the classical fermionic and bosonic

elds are complementary. in other words if we only introduce bosonic classical elds

in the starting action we need to introduce fermionic elds with odd integer ghost

number and bosonic elds with even integer ghost number as we have shown in sec-

tion 5. if we introduce the classical fermionic gauge elds, the odd and even nature

should be reversed for the ghost numbers when introducing the corresponding ghost

elds to the fermionic gauge elds. it seems to mean that even the fermionic and

bosonic elds have no essential dierence in the generalized chern-simons theory.

in other words fermionic elds, bosonic elds, classical elds and ghost elds are

mutually inter-related via the quantization procedure.

super symmetry is the natural consequence of topological symmetry with partial

gauge xing of instanton conditions. thus the introduction of super symmetry is

realized via quantization procedure.

in the generalized gauge theory graded lie

algebra plays an important role leading to the super symmetry.

the lessons from the lattice chern-simons gravity of the section 4 tell us that

the drei bein and spin connection can be simply put on the original and dual lattice,

respectively. this means that the elds of dierential forms from the generalized

gauge theory will be put on both of the original and dual lattice.

the standard model including weinberg-salam model will be realized by the

62

generalized gauge theory via non-commutative geometry mechanism. in particular

the quaternion algebra plays an essential role here again to formulate the gauge the-

ory of all the dierential forms. it should be noted that conness non-commutative

geometry formulation of weinberg-salam model is a particular example of our gen-

eralized gauge theory formulation. connes has speculated that the discrete two

points which he introduced in the non-commutative geometry formulation can be

interpreted as the discrete distance of the space time structure which is physically

related with the higgs vacuum expectation value[39].

in our generalized gauge theory the quaternion algebra is playing a fundamental

role and should have some physical or geometrical interpretation. i would like to

give conjectures on the possible interpretation of the quaternion and the fermion-

boson correspondence following to the suggestive examples of analyses given in this

summary.

conjectures

the generalized gauge theory will be formulated on the simplicial lattice manifold

and may play a fundamental role in formulating a unied model on the lattice.

quaternion algebra is responsible for dierentiating even simplexes, odd simplexes

corresponding to even forms and odd forms, and original simplicial lattice and the

dual simplicial lattice reecting boson and fermion nature. in particular discrete

two points in terms of non-commutative geometry would correspond to the original

lattice and dual lattice.

matter fermions are generated from ghosts via twisting mechanism which is

nothing but the dirac kahler fermion formulation. bosons and fermions are dual

to each other in the lattice simlex sense. in other words bosons are sitting on the

original lattice while fermions are sitting on the dual lattice and vice versa. chiral

fermion problem will be understood via dirac kahler fermion formulation. this

duality relation would be analogous to the ising model where the disorder variable

dened on the dual lattice is related to the fermion eld as shown in the subsection

2.1. strong coupling and weak coupling duality of krammers and wannier type is

working here and the fermion will be a soliton on the dual lattice. the origin of

63

the seiberg and witten formulation[55] will be related to the duality of original and

dual lattice.

due to the complete duality of the original lattice and the dual lattice where

fermions and bosons are located on the mutually dual lattices the super symmetry is

the natural consequence for the whole system. the super symmetry transformation

and the gauge transformation are the change of the elds from one simplex to the

other on the original lattice and the dual lattice. this is analogous to the lattice

gauge theory where even sites and odd sites exchange corresponds to the chiral

transformation.

instanton will play an essential role in this bosonization mechanism and also in

the breaking of the higher super symmetry or the topological symmetry.

the phenomenological results like the group structure of the standard model and

the number of the generations mentioned in the introduction will be understood from

this point of view.

questions

there are still many fundamental questions. in this summary we have mainly dis-

cussed topological eld theories which do not include dynamical degrees of freedom.

then the question arises:

how do the dynamical degrees of freedom appear starting from the theory with

higher symmetry such as n = 2 super symmetry and topological symmetry ?

we can guess that the classical solution like instanton may play an important role

to resolve the higher symmetry into lower symmetry but the mechanism is not yet

clear. the topological symmetry or n = 2 super symmetry may play a similar role

as the kinetic term in the lagrangian formulation of eld theory. the eld theories

keeping higher symmetry such as topological symmetry or higher super symmetry

may not yet have genuine non-perturbative interactions which break the symmetry

dynamically.

there are other questions concerning to the number of dimensions of our space-

time and minkowskian nature. string approach may be able to understand this

question[56]. i believe that the string approach and our approach is not incompatible

but rather complementary.
