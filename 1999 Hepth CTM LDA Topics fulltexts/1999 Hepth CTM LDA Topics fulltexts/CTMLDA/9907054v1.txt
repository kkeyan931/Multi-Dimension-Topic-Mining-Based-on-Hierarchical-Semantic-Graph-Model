abstract: we review the construction of non-supersymmetric open string vacua in various dimen-
sions. they can be obtained either projecting the (compactied) non-supersymmetric 0b theory,
or applying the scherk-schwarz mechanism to open strings. generically, these vacua generate a
non-vanishing cosmological constant. however, one can construct particular kinds of scherk-schwarz
compactications with vanishing cosmological constant, at least for low orders, based on asymmetric
orbifolds. a generic feature of these models is that supersymmetry remains unbroken on the branes
at all mass level, while it is broken in the bulk in a way that preserves fermi-bose degeneracy at each
mass level in the perturbative string spectrum

1. introduction

motivated by the ads/cft correspondence con-
jecture [1], in the last year we have witnessed
to an increasing interest in non-supersymmetric
string theories. on the one hand, the type 0b
theory has been proposed as the gravitational
description (on some appropriate background) of
non-supersymmetric gauge theories on d3-branes
[2]. on the other hand, the presence of non-
supersymmetric conformal xed lines has sug-
gested the existence of non-supersymmetric string
vacua with vanishing cosmological constant [3].
since type 0 theories have only bosonic excita-
tions, this last scenario requires non-standard orb-
ifold compactications of type ii superstrings [4].
consistent non-supersymmetric vacuum con-
gurations in various dimensions have been re-
cently constructed in dierent contexts. in the
field theory limit the scherk-schwarz mecha-
nism [5] provides an elegant realization of su-
persymmetry breaking by compactication. the
higher dimensional elds are single valued on the
internal manifold up to a (quantized) r-symmetry
transformation. as a result, the scale of super-
symmetry breaking is quantized in units of the
inverse size of the internal manifold. this mech-

anism has been extended to the full perturbative
spectrum in models of oriented closed strings [6]
and in the corresponding open descendants [7].

it has long been known that, besides the ve
supersymmetric strings, there are a number of
non-supersymmetric theories in ten dimensions
[8]. it was shown in [9] that the type 0a and 0b
theories allow the construction of open descen-
dants following [10]. typically, these theories in-
clude in their spectrum tachyonic modes (both in
the closed and in the open sector) and thus have
often been regarded as toy models. recently, it
has been shown that tachyons in the open sector
can be stabilized [11] and then do not represent
an inconsistency of the theory. nevertheless, in
order to study consistent string vacua one should
get rid of all tachyonic modes. to this end, one
can use the crosscap constraint [12] to change
the world-sheet projection, , in the closed un-
oriented sector and remove all tachyonic modes
both in the closed and open unoriented sectors
[13, 14, 15, 16] .

typically, these two dierent approaches to
the construction of non-supersymmetric string
vacua all generate a non-vanishing cosmological
constant at one loop. thus, in order to describe
the four-dimensional low-energy world one should
nd mechanisms that break supersymmetry with-

out generating any cosmological constant at least
on suitable branes. these kinds of compacti-
cations do exist and are related to asymmetric
orbifolds [4]. the main idea consists nding par-
ticular kinds of projections that break supersym-
metry only in the (anti-)holomorphic sector, thus
ensuring the vanishing of the (one-loop) partition
function. when projected with respect to the
combined action of all the orbifold generators,
the resulting model is non-supersymmetric, but
has an equal number of fermionic and bosonic
degrees of freedom at each mass level.

this paper is organized as follows. in sec-
tion 2 we review some basic facts about the con-
struction of open descendants, and in particular
discuss the crosscap constraint. in section 3 we
discuss the construction of tachyon-free open de-
scendants of the 0b theory in six and four dimen-
sions. in section 4 we present non-supersymmetric
vacuum congurations of open strings with van-
ishing cosmological constant. these are open de-
scendants of the model introduced in [18] .

2. the crosscap constraint

let us review some known facts about the con-
struction of open descendants. the starting point
is a theory of oriented closed strings invariant
under the world-sheet parity . for example,
one can consider type iib or type 0 theories in
d = 10, or any d-dimensional theory whose torus
partition function

t = x

a,b

anab b

(2.1)

is dened through a gso projection nab com-
patible with world-sheet parity. then the -
projection halves the torus amplitude t and adds
to it the contribution of the klein bottle. actu-
ally, one has the freedom to project onto states
invariant under a modied world-sheet symme-
try  = j , where j is some automorphism
of the parent theory. typically, j corresponds
to a dierent gso projection in the parent the-
ory that manifests itself in a dierent modular
invariant combination of characters (the matrix
nab) in the torus partition function. however,
there are cases in which j reects an ambiguity
in dening the klein bottle amplitude associated

to a given gso projection of the closed oriented
string. in this case, they represent exhotic solu-
tions to the crosscap constraint [12].

the action of j on a given state |ai associ-
ated to the character a appearing diagonally in
t translates into a sign a in the corresponding
contribution to the klein bottle amplitude

k = 1

2 x

(2.2)

consistently with supersymmetry (if present) and
with the crosscap constraint

abc = +1 if nabc 6= 0 ,

(2.3)

where the tensor nabc encodes the fusion rules of
the states |ai.

an interesting example is the compactica-
tion of type iib on a circle of radius r. in this
case, the -projection is accompained by a z2
shift on the compact coordinate and then the re-
sulting klein bottle amplitude

k = 1

2 (v8  s8) x

()mq(m/r)2

(2.4)

introduces minus signs for the odd momentum
states [19, 20]. then, an s modular transforma-
tion reveals that there are no contributions from
massless states to the transverse channel that, as
a result, does not develop any tadpole for mass-
less unphysical states. one is not allowed to in-
troduce d-branes, and the theory does not con-
tain open strings.

more examples of generalized -projections
are oered by the type 0b theory. one has four
distinct choices, namely the standard -projection
and three additional j -projections, with j =
 (the z2 shift of the previous example), j =
()fr and j = ()gr , where fr (gr) is the
space-time (world-sheet) fermion number opera-
tor. in d = 10 these dierent projections have
been analyzed in [13]. particularly interesting
is the j = ()gr case, that results in a non-
supersymmetric non-tachyonic model. the non-
perturbative consistency of these models has been
recently addressed in [21]. their conclusion is
that the ()fr projection is ruled out since
in the decompactication limit it does not lift
to any symmetry of m-theory. this leaves only
the standard  projection and the non-tachyonic
one.

3. open descendants of the 0b string

the starting point is the 0b string in d = 10.
it can be constructed as an orbifold of type iib,
where the symmetry to be gauged is ()fl+fr.
obviously, this projection removes all the (space-
time) fermions and introduces, in the twisted sec-
tor, a tachyon and additional rr states. in terms
of characters of ane so(8) at level one, the
massless and massive excitations of the 0b string
can then be collected in the torus partition func-
tion

t = |o8|2 + |v8|2 + |s8|2 + |c8|2 ,

(3.1)

aside from transverse bosonic modes. due to the
presence of the tachyon, the theory is unstable
unless one goes o-criticality, and the vev of the
tachyon is chosen to precisely compensate the
decit of central charge [22]. ten-dimensional
stable non-tachyonic vacuum congurations can
indeed be constructed modding out type 0b by
the combination ()gr [13]. since the klein
bottle amplitude now antisymmetrizes all the sta-
tes associated to the o8 character, this projec-
tion removes the tachyon from the closed spec-
trum. typically, this is not sucient to guar-
antee the stability of the open descendants. a
new complex tachyon in the bi-fundamental of a
gauge group u(n )  u(32 + n ) appears in the
open unoriented sector, where each unitary group
comes from the two dierent d9-branes that exist
in type 0b. however, tadpole conditions do not
x the number of d9 and, say, d9-branes sepa-
rately. as a result, one is free to choose n = 0, -
nally obtaining a non-tachyonic model with xed
gauge group. it should be noted that the con-
sistency of the construction forces one to relax
the dilaton tadpole. for 0b theories this does
not cause any problem, since ns and r elds are
no longer related by space-time supersymmetry.
the tadpole of the dilaton, or of any other phys-
ical eld, can then be disposed by the fishler-
susskind mechanism [17].

one can now try to generalize this construc-
tion to d-dimensional vacua. toroidal compacti-
cations can be treated precisely in the same way,
since they do not introduce new structures. on
the contrary, interesting new features are present
in orbifold compactications. since the start-

ing theory is not supersymmetric, one can study
both supersymmetric orbifolds [14, 15] and non-
supersymmetric ones [16] 1. for supersymmet-
ric t 4/zn and t 6/zn an exhaustive analysis
shows that, for generic n , the untwisted sec-
tor includes a tachyon, directly related to the
ten-dimensional tachyon of 0b, invariant under
the action of zn . typically, one nds additional
(complex) tachyons in the twisted sectors. how-
ever, these can not be projected out in the open
descendant by any j projection at generic (non-
rational) points in the moduli space since, for a
geometric action of the orbifold generators, the
associated partition function belongs to the fam-
ily of charged conjugate modular invariants. this
means that states in the -twisted sector are pai-
red with states in the 1-twisted one, and the
net number of tachyons is then simply halved by
any -projection. an exception are the orbifolds
t 6/z3 and t 4/z2, since they do not generate
tachyonic modes in the twisted sectors.

the t 6/z3 orbifold [14, 15] resembles the
one studied in [23] aside from the fact that now
one is starting from the 0b theory. the low-
lying excitations of the resulting theory comprise
a tachyon, the metric tensor, two abelian vectors
and sixty scalars from the untwisted sector and
162 = 27  6 scalars from the 27 xed points in
the twisted sectors. the only states that are ef-
fectively left-right (anti-)symmetric are the tachy-
onic vacuum, g, the two a and two scalars
related to the dimensional reduction of the dila-
ton and of the (dualized) ns-ns antisymmetric
tensor. then, the standard klein bottle ampli-
tude would project out the two vectors and the
b , while keeping the tachyon. on the con-
trary, combining the world-sheet parity with the
world-sheet fermion number, ()gr, has the
virtue of removing the tachyon from the spec-
trum while keeping one of the two vectors, con-
sistently with the crosscap constraint. the re-
maining massless states are simply halved by any
-projection, since their holomorphic and anti-
holomorphic parts come from dierent sectors.
summarizing, the non tachyonic spectrum com-

1by supersymmetric orbifolds here we mean orbifold
compactications that would give supersymmetric vacua
if one started from type ii, type i or (supersymmetric)
heterotic strings.

prises the graviton, an abelian vector and 111
scalars.

moving to the open unoriented sector, also in
this case we see a doubling of the gauge group.
this reects the doubling of the rr sector in the
0b theory, that introduces two dierent kinds of
d9-branes. in addition, the ()gr projection en-
hances the so(n) factors that one would naively
expect for a z3 orbifold [23] to u(n) groups.
thus, tadpole cancellations2 partially x the form
of the chan-paton gauge group
gcp = (cid:2)u(n)  u(m)2(cid:3)99 

 (cid:2)u(8 + n)  u(12 + m)2(cid:3)99 .

while leaving the total dimension arbitrary. as
for the ten-dimensional case, one nds in the
spectrum a complex tachyon in the 99 sector. it
is then evident that the choice n = m = 0 leads
to an open sector free of tachyons with a u(8) 
u(12)2 gauge group. the remaining (charged)
massless excitations comprise three scalars in the
[(8, 12, 1)  (8, 1, 12)  (1, 12, 12)  c.c] repre-
sentations, one dirac fermion in the (28, 1, 1) 
(1, 12, 12) representations, and, nally, three chi-
ral fermions in the (8, 1, 12) (8, 12, 1) (1, 66,
1)  (1, 1, 66) representations [14, 15]. the van-
ishing of the irreducible part of the gauge anomaly
is a consequence of the cancellation of twisted
tadpoles [24].

let us now turn to the t 4/z2 orbifold. as
one would expect, here we have a richer struc-
ture, since the orbifold group includes an element
that squares to the identity (the generator itself).
as a result d5-branes are also present [25, 26].
moreover, the projection ()gr introduces mi-
nus signs in the twisted sector of the klein bot-
tle amplitude, consistently with the fact that the
fusion of an untwisted state with a twisted one
gives another state that belongs to the twisted
sector: the crosscap constraint then forces one
to introduce further signs in the twisted sector.
as we have already discussed, the inclusion of the
world-sheet fermion number in the -projection
removes the tachyon from the closed unoriented
sector. the massless states that survive the pro-
jection give a chiral spectrum consisting of the

discuss later on, the fishler-susskind mechanism is to be
invoked to cure the uncancelled dilaton tadpole.

metric tensor, 4 antiself-dual 2-forms, 20 self-
dual 2-forms and 99 scalars, while the open un-
oriented sector contains two pairs of d9 and d5-
branes with a chan-paton gauge group

gcp = [u(n)99  u(16 + n)99 ] 

 [u(m)55  u(16 + m)55 ] (3.2)
the open tachyons correspond to open strings
stretched between d9 and d9 branes and d5 and
d5 branes. it is then evident that if one sets n
and m to zero, consistently with tadpole condi-
tions, the resulting model is free of any closed and
open tachyons. the remaining massless scalars
and spinors charged under the chan-paton gauge
group contribute to the cancellation of the irre-
ducible part of the anomaly polynomial, while a
generalized green-schwarz mechanism is at work
to cancel the residual reducible anomaly [27].

actually, this model allows two dierent spec-
tra of charged states [14, 15]. this is due to the
possibility of adding discrete wilson lines in the
mobius amplitude, i.e. relative phases between
holes and crosscaps [9]. this results into a dif-
ferent p transformation, and, thus, in a dierent
mobius vacuum amplitude. precisely the inclu-
sion of discrete wilson lines in d = 6 allowed
the authors of [9] to construct the u(16) u(16)
model, rediscovered after some years in [26]. dif-
ferent t 4/z2 type 0b descendants neatly can be
constructed at rational points in the internal lat-
tice. for example, starting from the so(8) lat-
tice as in [9, 20] new massless scalars collapse to
zero mass, in a way reminiscent of what happens
in the bosonic and heterotic strings, for which
one has symmetry enhancement at special points
in the moduli space. moreover, one has sev-
eral choices of inequivalent sign assignements for
the klein bottle amplitude, that lead to dier-
ent non-tachyonic vacuum congurations. due
to the presence of an antisymmetric tensor back-
ground in the so(8) lattice, one expects chan-
paton gauge groups of reduced rank [28] and ad-
ditional self-dual 2-forms related to a dierent
klein bottle projection in the twisted sector [29].
compactications on the simplest instance
of non-supersymmetric orbifolds have been re-
cently considered by blumenhagen and kumar
[16]. they studied the t 6/z2 case, where all

4

internal coordinates are reversed under the z2.
typically, this particular projection does not sat-
isfy the constraints of modular invariance for the
superstring.
it acts as a z4 action on the ra-
mond sector, and introduces phases in the ns-
r and r-ns sectors. however, the action on
the type 0b is perfectly consistent. one can
project further the theory by ()gr to get non-
tachyonic four-dimensional open string vacua. the
result is similar to the 6d one previously dis-
cussed, but with d3-branes instead of d5-branes.

4. non-supersymmetric vacua with

vanishing cosmological constant

non-supersymmetric vacua with a vanishing cos-
mological constant can be obtained as asymmet-
ric orbifolds of type ii and/or type i superstrings.
the simplest instance of these models can be ob-
tained considering the generators [18]

f = [(14, 1; 15), (04, vl; 4, vr), ()fr ] ,
g = [(15;14, 1), (4, wl; 04, wr), ()fl ] , (4.1)
that dene a non-abelian space group orbifold s
[30]. here the rst entry inside the square brack-
ets denotes rotations, the second denotes shifts
on the internal compactication lattice while the
third entry denotes projections on states with
even left (right) space-time fermion number. a
semicolon separates holomorphic and antiholo-
morphic coordinates. the asymmetric nature
of the orbifold requires that the internal four-
dimensional lattice splits into a product of four
circles with self-dual radius r = . level
matching requires  be a shift by r/2, while
no further constraints are imposed on the ra-
dius of the fth coordinate, for which the shifts
vl,r = wr,l act as a2 shifts in the notation of
[31].

,

due to the presence of ()fl

r , the g (f )
generator projects out all gravitini coming from
the (anti)holomorphic sector, and therefore the
combined action of f and g breaks supersym-
metry completely, while ensuring the vanishing
of the one-loop contribution to the cosmologi-
cal constant. in [32] it was argued that higher
order perturbative corrections to the cosmologi-
cal constant vanish as well. there are, however,

non-perturbative contributions originating from
wrapped d-branes that can be studied perturba-
tively on the dual heterotic model [18] or com-
puting the d-brane spectra using boundary-state
techniques [33].

in order to construct the orbifold (4.1), it
is simpler to restrict onself to the abelian point
group p [30], thus dening a new compactica-
tion lattice 4,4(so(8))  1,1(r). in this case,
p reduces to an abelian z2z2 orbifold. the re-
sulting one-loop partition function involves only
the modular orbit generated by the untwisted
sector. this fact has two dierent interpreta-
tions in the space group and in the point group
approaches to the orbifold. in the former, it is
due to the fact that the path integral receives
contributions only from commuting spin struc-
tures [30], whereas in the latter the disconnected
orbit vanishes due to the simultaneous action of
shifts and rotations [34].

invariance under world-sheet parity forces one
to start with the type iib superstring modded
out by the elements (4.1). using the characters
of ane so(2n) at level one, the massless con-
tributions to the torus amplitude read

tuntw  |v4o4|2 + |s4s4|2 +

(o4v4)( c4 c4)  (c4c4)( o4 v4) ,

tf gtw  8 |o4s4  c4o4|2 ,
that translate into the following ve-dimensional
eld content: the metric tensor, seven abelian
vectors, six scalars and eight fermions from the
untwisted sector, and eight vectors, forty scalars
and sixteen fermions from the f g-twisted sector.
due to the presence of the shifts, the f and g-
twisted sectors are massive, so that no massless
gravitini originate from them.

the construction of the open descendants re-
quires suitable contributions from the klein bot-
tle, annulus and mobius strip world-sheet topolo-
gies [10, 9].
in the following we will just de-
scribe the main features of the model and we refer
the interested reader to [35] for details3. at the
massless level one nds the following contribu-

3see also [36] for a dierent approach to the construc-
tion of the d-brane structure for the asymmetric orbifold
(4.1).

tions:

k  (v4o4s4s4)+(62) (o4s4c4o4) (4.2)
from the klein bottle amplitude,

a  2m m (v4o4  s4s4) +

from the annulus amplitude, and, nally,

(4.3)

m  (m + m )( o4 v4  c4 c4)

(4.4)

from the mobius amplitude. since the action
of the generators f and g is equivalent to a t-
duality transformation, the open unoriented sec-
tor involves only one kind of charges, a linear
combination of (wrapped) d9 and d5-branes. in
the klein bottle amplitude we have explicitly writ-
ten how the -projection acts on the f g-twisted
sector. not all the contributions are treated in
the same way.  (anti-)symmetrizes the (r-r)
ns-ns sector of six (f -invariant combinations of)
xed points , and (anti-)symmetrizes the (ns-
ns) r-r sector of the remaining two xed points.
this is due to the presence of a non-vanishing bab
background in the so(8) lattice [37, 29].

the cancellation of tadpoles of unphysical
massless states in the transverse channel then
xes the size of the chan-paton gauge group, so
that m = m = 8. the rank reduction is due
both to the presence of a non-vanishing back-
ground for the ns-ns antisymmetric tensor in
the so(8) lattice [28, 37, 29] and to the identi-
cation of (wrapped) d9 and d5-branes under
the action of the orbifold generators (4.1). the
massless closed unoriented spectrum comprises
a graviton, 4 abelian vectors, 31 scalars and 12
fermions. the massless unoriented open sector
is by itself supersymmetric, and comprises an
n = 2 vector multiplet with gauge group u(8),
as well as a hypermultiplet in the representations
28 28. moreover, the amplitudes k, a, and m
are supersymmetric at each mass level, compat-
ibly with the vanishing of the (one-loop) cosmo-
logical constant. this has to be contrasted with
what usually happens in m-theory breaking of
type i models [7] and in the heterotic dual of
[18, 35], where supersymmetry is realized in the
gauge sector only at the massless level.

in conclusion, one can study the limiting be-
havior of the type i model for large and small ra-
dius. for r  0 new uncancelled tadpoles arise
in the transverse channels, thus inducing linear
divergences in the ve-dimensional gauge theory
on the branes [38]. on the contrary, as r  
the action of the f and g generators is trivial-
ized, while the sector projected and/or twisted
by the combined f g action survives. the decom-
pactication limit then corresponds to a t 4/z2
orbifold. due to the presence of a non-vanishing
ux for the ns-ns bab, the type i compactica-
tion comprises at massless level additional ten-
sor multiplets and has a chan-paton group with
reduced rank. one nds a d = 6 n = (1, 0)
supergravity multiplet coupled to 5 tensor mul-
tiplets and 16 hypermultiplets from the closed
unoriented sector together with a vector multi-
plet in the adjoint representation of u(8)  u(8)
and charged hypermultiplets in the representa-
tions (28  28, 1)  (1, 28  28)  (8, 8)  (8, 8)
from the open unoriented sector, one of the mod-
els of [9, 20]. the presence of additional tensor
multiplets calls for a generalized green-schwarz
mechanism for the cancellation of the residual
anomaly [27].
