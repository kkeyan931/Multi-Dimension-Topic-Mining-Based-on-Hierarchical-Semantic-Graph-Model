abstract
in this paper we construct non-abelian gauge theories with fermions and
scalars that nevertheless possess asymptotic freedom.the scalars are taken
to be in a chiral multiplet transforming as (2, 2) under su(2)l  su(2)r
and transforming as singlets under the colour su(3) group. we consider
two distinct scenarios, one in which the additional scalars are light and an-
other in which they are heavier than half the z-boson mass. it is shown that
asymptotic freedom is obtained without requiring that all additional cou-
plings keep xed ratios with each other. it is also shown that both scenarios
can not be ruled out by what are considered standard tests of qcd like r-
parameter, g-2 for muons or deep inelastic phenomena. the light mass sce-
nario is however ruled out by high precision z-width data (and only by that
one data).the heavy mass scenario is still viable and is shown to naturally
pass the test of avour changing neutral currents.it also is not ruled out
by precision electroweak oblique parameters.many distinctive experimental
signatures of these models are also discussed.

1 introduction

quantum chromodynamics (qcd) is today believed to be the correct theory
of strong interactions. the reasons for this belief are, on the one hand, the
fact that the global symmetries of qcd and that of the observed hadronic
world are the same, and on the other hand, the phenomenon of asymptotic

1

freedom(af) [1]1.
indeed, asymptotic freedom (af) allows one to make
experimental comparisons with the predictions of qcd in the deep inelastic
regime and the evidence in favour of qcd appears to be quite compelling.
nevertheless,
it is extremely important to analyse the experimental data
within a broader theoretical framework that contains qcd as a special case.
the need for a framework to analyse data that is larger than the theory
one is trying to uphold is fairly obvious. otherwise the data analysis is likely
to be biased by elements of the theory itself. of course, no analysis of the
data is possible without some theoretical framework. but such a theoretical
framework should be as broad as possible. for example, analysis of gravi-
tational phenomena in the framework of brans-dicke theory, parametrised
by an additional parameter  over and above those of general theory of
relativity (gtr), leading to very large values of  ( gtr is the   
limit) is a superrior vindication of gtr than the one done entirely within
the framework of gtr. speaking in the modern language of renormalisation
group and fixed points, several rg-trajectories could, for example, be ow-
ing towards the same infra-red xed point and in the vicinity of that xed
point several ows could be practically indistinguishable ( this is illustrated
in g. 1). a wider analysis of the data would be in terms of the universality
class to which the xed point belongs while an analysis based on a particular
theory would correspond to one of the many trajectories owing into the
xed point.

such a broader framework must necessarily possess the property of af
without which it would be impossible to make any credible statements about
deep inelastic phenomena. also, on theoretical grounds it is believed today
that only those theories possessing af can be consistent [3]2. while the
relationship between af and scaling is not straightforward, as argued by
gross, non-af theories are unlikely to lead to scaling. from the works of
gross and coleman[4] it is well known that non-abelian gauge elds are

1 seiler and patrasciou [2]have, however, presented a dissenting perspective on asymp-

totic freedom and reliability of perturbative methods in non-abelian gauge theories

2 in a pragmatic sense one could argue that since we do not believe even theories like
qcd or the standard model to be valid at arbitrarily large energy scales, the issue of
whether a theory should possess af is a moot one though the presence of af in the sense
of a region where couplings are small and get smaller with scale, would be important from
a phenomenological point of view. even such a pragmatic view would perhaps admit that
the ultimate theory would possess af.

2

indispensable, at least in four dimensions, for realising af. it is also by
now well known that the matter content of gauge theories has important
repercussions for the survival of af. for example, for su(3) colour gauge
theories, more than 16 families of quarks in the fundamental representation
of the gauge group would spoil af. however, relatively less is known about
the inuence of scalar elds on af. in some specic cases, depending on the
choice of the scalar representation af could be obtained by ne-tuning the
scalar self-coupling , but did not occur naturally as in qcd. to paraphrase
g. thooft:  in gauge theories with fermions and scalars the situation is
complicated. if one imposes the condition that all beta functions come out
negative one usually nds that all coupling constants should keep xed ratios
with each other[5]. however, in this paper we show that the situation need
not be as restrictive as that.

in this paper we consider alternatives to qcd by enlarging the matter
sector to include elementary scalar elds. we are using the phrase  matter
elds in a generalised sense to include all elds that couple directly to quarks
or to gluons. one may argue that what we have considered here are really
alternatives to the standard model. we prefer to view our attempts as
alternatives to qcd because the symmetry structure of the extended sector
is su(2)l  su(2)r. of course inclusion of the u(1)-sector of electroweak
interactions eventually reduces the su(2)r part of this symmetry.
we restrict our attention to cases where the additional scalars are colour
singlets. this restriction can obviously be removed and an even larger class
of theories studied. we postpone such an analysis to the future. of course,
if the scalars were not colour singlets, even the one loop -function for the
qcd coupling constant would change and it is doubtful whether the nice
features obtained here would survive. in fact it is believed that in qcd it
will be hard to add scalars (coupled to gluons) while keeping af because the
quarks are in the fundamental representation and that that is the reason why
fundamental scalars that couple to the strong gauge group can not exist[5].
this choice of the colour singlet scalars was strongly motivated for us by
the fact that the gell-mann-levy linear -model with quarks substituted for
nucleons has been found to provide a very reasonable description of the nu-
cleon as well as of the strong interactions at nite temperature and density.
while the linear model was not asymptotically free and could therefore be
considered only as a low energy eective theory, the tantalising new question
that emerges is that of the af of the alternative theories with a chiral multi-

3

plet of scalar elds. it was established in [6] that such a model can indeed be
af in certain regions of the parameter space. what was however not clear
at that time was the relation of this model to qcd itself; even the possibility
that this theory is indistinguishable from qcd could not be ruled out.

in the present work we consider this issue at length by rst establishing
that there are indeed classes of such theories that are asymptotically free
in all the additional couplings and that af is stable against inclusion of
the electro-weak sector 3, and that not all of them are equivalent. we then
proceed to confront these classes with existing experimental data to see their
viability. our analysis shows that for deep inelastic scattering the leading
behaviour of this theory in the ultra violet is identical to that of qcd. this
is so as the yukawa coupling and the scalar self coupling go to zero faster
than the qcd coupling. in fact, the numerical factors that arise are such as
to make even the subleading qcd corrections to be marginally larger than
the contributions of these extra couplings. this is important as some high
energy experiments are already sensitive to these subleading corrections.

we further nd that the usual strong interaction tests for qcd based
on the properties of quarks and gluons will all go through for this theory.
the other set of tests for the particle content of qcd include the precision
measurements like the r parameter and the g-2 for the muon. here we will
have extra contributions from our new scalar color singlet partons which
couple to the photon. however , we nd both these precision tests cannot
condently rule out our theory in favour of qcd.

a careful analysis of the avour changing neutral currents of our model
reveals more or less uniform coupling to all avours if signicant avour
changing neutral currents are to be avoided. in contrast,extensions of the
standard model available in the literature like two higgs doublet models
(thdm),supersymmetric extensions of standard model like ssm,mssm etc
generically predict dominant coupling to heavy avours as well as coupling to
associated leptons. our model naturally avoids coupling of the chiral scalars
with leptons.

the most important conclusions we have reached are that while the al-
ternatives with massless or nearly massless chiral multiplets are ruled out by

3this is of course true only when the u(1) couplings are ignored. also, the higgs-
yukawa and the higgs self-coupling of the standard model violate af. these features are
not altered in our alternative models.

4

high precision z-width data[7] (interestingly they are ruled out at present
only by this one observable), those with suitably massive chiral multiplets
can not be ruled out by current experimental data. we then propose a va-
riety of experimental tests for such extended models that have hitherto not
been performed.

in such a theories, a distinctive signal will be the appearance of an excess
of four jet events in e+e - collisions over what is to be expected from the
standard model. such four jet signals arise as the massive scalars eventually
decay into qq pairs.
though the aleph collaboration [20, 21, 22] had reported seeing such an
excess of four jet events in e+e collisions at s = 130,136,161 and 172 gev
respectively, they have subsequently attributed the excess to uctuations and
do not see any excess in the later runs. nevertheless, it is intertesting that so
many features of the additional four jet events that follow naturally and in a
parameter-free manner in our theories[8] were reported by aleph in their
earlier claims. the disappearance of the aleph events does not repudiate
our model. it only raises the limit on the mass of the scalars which is also
consistent with other precision searches for additional heavy particles. the
present lower limit on the masses of such particles is around 100 gev.

the precision tests of the standard model based on the so called oblique
parameters s,t&u [24, 25, 26] also do not rule out the extensions considered
here.

the latter are bound states the , ~ of eqn (1) are elementary, to be thought

it is further assumed that in the extended sector there is no spontaneous

2.1 higgs sector

since the additional multiplet has to be massive,it is economical to have their
masses generated by the higgs mechanism. the simplest way to do this is
by introducing the coupling

(10)

note that both eqn (1) and eqn (10) are invariant under su(2)l  su(2)r
of eqn (3). if the higgs is not too light but lighter than the top quark, this
channel would be the most dominant mode for higgs to decay and would open
a new window into higgs search. this additional coupling to higgs raises
new issues;for example, the renormalisation group eqns for the ow of both
the yukawa coupling gy and the scalar self coupling  will now change due
to the additional coupling . more importantly, the renormalisation group
ow for the higgs coupling parameters of the standard model will change due
to the coupling of the higgs to the chiral multiplet considered here. these
issues will be addressed elsewhere. it also raises the issue of radiative mixing
between the chiral multiplet and higgs particle, which by design is absent at
tree level. this is discussed in detail later in the text.

2.2 unitarity constraints

one of the key properties of the standard model is the unitarity of all scat-
tering amplitudes. the standard model higgs kills the bad high-energy be-
haviour of processes like w w  w w and w w  f f where f is any
fermion. introduction of new bosons into the theory that couple to fermions
and gauge bosons should not spoil this . the necessary and sucient condi-
tions for this are [23]

igh0

hv v

ig2
h0
i v v  gh0

i v v = g2
i f f = ghv v  ghf f

(11)

where h is the standard model higgs and h0
i are all the neutral scalar elds
of the theory including the analog of h. in our theory, since there is no ssb
in the chiral - multiplet sector, no v v coupling is introduced and the above
conditions are trivially satised.

(cid:16)g2
3 = (cid:17)

(12)

where t = ln(p/).
to this order the -function for the qcd coupling does not receive any
contribution from gy, , g or g as neither the chiral multiplet nor the electro-
weak gauge bosons couple directly to gluons.

the situation with the beta functions for gy,  is , however, more intricate.
if the u(1)-coupling g is large, radiative corrections will spoil the su(2)l 
su(2)r structure.
instead of a single yukawa coupling as in eqn(1), one
would have

y ukawa = gy1(ul dl)ur + gy2(ul dl)dr + h.c

(13)

where  = c is the charge-conjugate of . we will show shortly that the
u(1)-coupling can be neglected in the one-loop analysis and one can continue
to use the form as in eqn(1). before doing that we derive the full beta

in these equations, the terms in bold are the ones arising out of loops with
m as the largest mass (except the cases where the one of the internal fermion
lines is that of top quark). the signicance of these terms will be claried
shortly. already at this stage it is clear that the u(1)-coupling g has a
negligible inuence. this follows from the fact that g2  g2 and that g2 is
already about a fourth of g2
3 (say, near the scale of the z-mass; at lower scales,
due to the non-asymptotically free nature of g, the importance of it becomes

9

even less). but this would be a little hasty though correct observation. to
see this, let us introduce, following [9], 1 = g2

where a = 11  2nf /3. thus we see that the contributions due to  should
really be negligible in comparison to a  8  9/4 in order that we can
ignore the u(1)-couplings as it is the sign of a  8  9/4  c in eqns(14)
that determines whether the ows are asymptotically free or not. it is also
signicant for this discussion that all the gauge couplings g3, g, g enhance
the tendency towards asymptotic freedom. for nf = 6, 5, a  8 = 1, 1/3
respectively and one can have af regions for 1, 2 irrespective of the values
of , . at a scale  mz where a  8 = 1/3, 9/4  0.6 and 17  0.12
and thus neglecting the  contribution leads to an error of about 10%.in
the eqn for the average of 1, 2 this error is in fact only about 8%.
it
should however be kept in mind that eventually the u(1)-coupling grows in
the asymptotia because of the lack of asymptotic freedom in this coupling.
but in practical terms this coupling begins to equal the other couplings only
around  1014gev or so, which is a scale far beyond the scope of our model.
we therefore emphasise that our discussion of asymptotic freedom is within
the natural framework where asymptotia means a scale much larger than all
the natural scales of the theory and for our model should be thought of as
in the range 100-1000 gev.

it should be observed that if we neglect the  contribution, a consistent
solution to eqn(14) is 1 = 2. in the wilson rng spirit we take this branch
as dening our theory. then the terms in boldface in these eqns vanish with
the consequence that as we cross the mass threshold at m, the ow eqns of
the theory are unmodied. we shall return to a discussion of the eects of
various mass thresholds shortly.

thus we can return to analysing the theory in terms of a single gy and in

terms of  = g2

as it stands, the above eqn can not be integrated analytically because  is a
function of . it is however illuminating to consider eqn(15) after neglecting
the -dependent term, as in that case the eqn is analytically soluble and pos-
sesses qualitatively similar features as the full equation. thus the equation

for the nf = 6 case where a = 7, calling c = 1/12, there are two regimes:

the region 0 <  < c:
in this case  / > 0. this implies that  decreases as  decreases,
that is,  will decrease with increasing momentum scale. we can integrate
the  equation to get

fore, the leading behaviour of this theory in the ultraviolet is given by that of
standard qcd , with the yukawa coupling contributing only in sub leading
order.

the region  > 1/12 is also of interest, though from a dierent physical
perspective. however, the theory is not af in this region. therefore we shall
not consider it anymore in this paper.

11

the above analysis is valid for q2  m2

t . for the region mb  q  mt,
the relevant behaviours are : c = 1/36,   k1/23. for nf  4 this
approximate eqn does not admit any af regime. but by the time the eective
nf reaches 4,   2.74 and the one-loop analysis need not be trusted.
now let us return to the more precise eqn(15). as mentioned earlier, the
explicit dependence of  makes it dicult to analyse this equation analyti-
cally. however, the precise form of  can be obtained by integrating the ow

where nf , ns are the number of fermion and (complex) scalar multiplets in the

model, if ng is the number of quark-lepton generations, nf = 2ng. however,
it is more instructive to separate the lepton and quark contributions as all the
lepton thresholds would be contributing, but not all the quark thresholds.
then, nf = 3

triples the value of c! this is clearly of great relevance to the phenomenology
of this model. an accurate numerical solution of these eqns will be provided

3.1 threshold eects

we have treated the ow equations without regard to the various mass thresh-
olds. a precise treatment of this is very complicated and is not warranted
right now. however, the qualitative trends can be analysed. as one comes
down from deep asymptotia, the rst mass threshold to be encountered(in
our model) is the top mass threshold at  175gev . below this(actually
much below this, but we shall not go into such ner details), the eective
nf = 5 and it remains at this value till we reach the bottom threshold at
5 gev where it jumps to 4. in regions where nf  4 one loop results need
not be reliable. as one goes below the threshold at mz, the  contributions
to the ow equations drop out. of course, the  contributions arising out of
the massless photon exchanges are always present, but due to the combined
eects of the asymptotically free nature of (which therefore keeps increas-
ing towards the infrared) and the non-asymptotically free nature of g(which
therefore keeps decreasing towards the infrared) ,  actually decreases very

13

rapidly. as we have already remarked,the threshold at m has no eect.
this is a very important property of the model which allows the ow eqns
derived above both for the scenario in which the chiral multiplet is light mass
as well as the case where they are considered to be at least as massive as
mz/2. thus for nf  4, our one-loop ow eqn reduces to the approximate
form of eqn(16) which has no asymptotically free solutions.
for the purposes of our paper (in the context of the discussion on g2 for
muons) it is important that regions where qcd is perturbatively treatable,
our theory is too. af for the scale > mb implies   1/36. thus at q = mb,
the yukawa couplings are small. now the lack of af for q < mb has the
desired eect of making  even smaller as we go to smaller energy scales.
thus gy is perturbatively treatable wherever qcd is.

3.2 scalar self-coupling

coupling . we leave all details of the calculation and merely present the full

this is the same type of eqn that was considered in [9]; it depends only on 
and can be easily solved analytically. it is found that only on a single trajec-
tory in the [r, ] parameter space, that is the so called invariant line [11]-[18],
the behaviour of r for the regime n 
g < 1/12 is such that r  0 in the

14

ultraviolet. it follows further that   12n

g in the extreme ultraviolet even

in gs. 3 and 4 we have shown the ow diagrams for r according to eqn
(30) for the case n  g  = 3(a = 7). of particular importance is the function
r+() which is the positive root of

r2 + 18r + 4r/  216 = 0

(33)

such that r > r+, dr

fig. 3 shows r+() as well as the unique trajectory ( the invariant line ) on
which r is regular everywhere. every point on this line ows to r = 0 in

the uv as r = 48 and approaches r = 9 + 279 in the ir. for points
d is positive. the point  = 1/36 at which the value
of r on the invariant line is rc = 81 + 6777 is shown by the cross. the
typical ows are shown in g. 4. the curve above the invariant line but to
the right of  = 1/36 is such that all points on it ow to r =  in the ir,
but approach the invariant line in the uv. the ow to the right of  = 1/36
but below the invariant line is such that all points on it ow to r = 0 in
the ir at some nite scale and eventually to negative r, but converge to the
invariant line in uv. likewise, the ow to the left of  = 1/36 which is above
the invariant line is such that all points on it move to r in the ir but to
r =  at a nite scale in the uv. the ow to the left of  = 1/36 below
the invariant line is such that it ows to r in the ir but goes to r = 0 at
a nite scale in the uv and eventually to negative values of r.

on the other hand, the structure of the eqn(29) shows that there can be
no solution for r that is regular as   0. but there is no reason for r to be
regular for  to be asymptotically free because  could be vanishing slower
than g2
in fact an inspection of eqn(29)
shows that as   0 r must approach c/ where c satises

y and yet be asymptotically free.

thus we have classes of theories that are not only af in all their couplings,
but become increasingly indistinguishable from qcd at high energies. as far
as af is concerned one loop analysis is stable against higher loop corrections
[4]. since these classes of theories are af, they are all candidates for a
consistent theory of strong interactions.

3.3 higgs- chiral scalar mixing

since both the chiral multiplet and the standard model higgs doublet cou-
ple directly to quarks and electroweak gauge bosons, quantum uctuations
generically lead to a mixing between them. the typical loop diagrams that
contribute to such mixing is shown in g. 5. these diagrams are also di-
vergent. thus renormalisability of the model would require the most general
higgs-chiral scalar coupling and not just the coupling in eqn (8). it is also
clear that the mixing generated by these diagrams reduces su(2)l su(2)r
to su(2)lu(1). in current literature one usually nds such couplings under
the assumtion of some discrete symmetries. such discrete symmetries which
in our case are present at tree level, are broken by quantum corrections. the
most general such potential without assuming any discrete symmetries is

v = 2

(36)

our model at tree level is assumed to be such that only 1, 2, 1, 2, 3
are non-vanishing. when quantum uctuations are taken into account, all
these parameters become scale dependent and one can not consistently put
them to zero at all scales. but the scale evolution of these parameters could
be such that for all practical purposes the parameters chosen to be zero
at tree level remain very small for all scales of interest. to establish this
completely satisfactorily requires a lot of work. instead, we shall show the
reasonableness of this by estimating the sizes of various diagrams after they
have been renormalised to keep the renormalised values of these parameters
at zero at some scale.

in the self energy type of graphs of g. 5, the dominant contribution
comes from the top quark loop. the higgs- top coupling is taken to be
  3/4. taking s = /(4)  0.1 and  = 1/36, one gets gy  1/5.5.

the self-energy graph at top mass scale can thus be estimated to be

should be compared with 2
. thus the mixing eect here
is indeed small. the mixing terms that are quartic in elds can be of the
type h 3, h 22, or h3. of these, h 3 can only be induced by quark
loop diagrams and here too the top loop would dominate. the expected
h 3-coupling is gy(3/4)3
82  103. likewise the h 22 induced by w-loop is
 (g2)2

chiral multiplet can be safely neglected.

4 massless scenario

in this section we consider the scenario where m is small. physically, this
circumstance could either arise when the su(2)l  su(2)r is spontaneously
broken giving rise to goldstone bosons with small masses due to some explicit
breaking by quark mass terms, or when the su(2)l  su(2)r symmetry
is manifest with a small chiral invariant mass term for the scalars. in the
following we analyse how this scenario is constrained by data on r-parameter,
g  2 for muons and high precision z-width data.

4.1 the r parameter
the r parameter measures the ratio of (e+e  hadrons) to (e+e 
+). in qcd , at high energies, the former is approximated by (e+e 
q q). when the energies are well below the z mass we can neglect the
contribution of the z mediated processes to r. to leading order , then, the
r parameter measures the total number of operational avours (of course,
multiplied by the number of colors of the quarks ), modulated by their charge
squared .

as we move to higher generations the r parameter changes rapidly at
quark mass thresholds. at thresholds we also encounter many resonances
which also give rapid changes in the r parameter. however, away from
thresholds r can be quite stable. therefore in the region above bb threshold
we expect r to be stable apart from qcd corrections. but as we approach

17

s = mz, a new class of diagrams become operative and subsequently the r
parameter has a steady rise to the z peak.

there is thus an energy region , 20- 40gev , where the eect of the z is
yet very small , where r is relatively stable. to leading order , that is , in
the absence of qcd corrections, here r0 = 11/3.

the r parameter will change for our theory as we have new scalar charged
partons , the + that couple to the photon which will contribute to the
hadronic cross section. for the the zero mass partons considered by us the
contribution to the r parameter is exactly calculable and is given by r = 1/4.
this additional contribution should be clearly visible, particularly in the
region: 20 - 40 gev . the contribution of z - exchanges are negligible in this
region.

the r parameter receives qcd corrections and the qcd corrected r
parameter in this region is: r(s) = r0(1 + s/ + ...) the measured value
of the r parameter in this region has a world average of 4.02. the dierence
between this number , 4.02 , and r0 = 11/3 is supposed to come from the
qcd corrections and yield a value for s at this energy scale.

however if we add the extra contribution of our new partons, r0 =
11/3 + 1/4 = 3.91, leaving only a decit of .11 to be accounted for by the
qcd corrections. the corresponding value of the qcd coupling will then
be too low to be admissable. however the systematic errors at amy, topaz
etc are not so small , of the order of 5% . also, dierent groups have re-
ported r in this region to be as high as 4.2 or even as low as 3.8 . this
circumstance means that our theory cannot be ruled out as the eect we are
considering is r/r = 6 %. it is worth pointing out that experimentally low
multiplicity ( 5) jets are not counted as these are very unlikely in qcd.
on the other hand, for the color neutral pionic partons of our theory, we
expect to have only low multiplicity jets most of which would have been ex-
cluded by experimental cuts.4 of course, two prong events would have been
counted as +-pairs and could have shown up as anomalies which could be
distinguished by their dierent angular dependence as compared to leptons.
given these facts the r parameter is not at present a denitve test for
this theory versus qcd though reduced systematic errors could put things

4 this exemplies the point made in the introduction whereby biases based on a par-
ticular theoretical framework ( qcd, in this case ) can surreptiously inuence the way the
data is analysed.

4.2

g-2 for the muon

the contribution to g-2 , the muon magnetic moment, can be potentially
disturbed by the presence of additional charged particles. our theory, in the
light mass scenario considered in this section, has particles with zero or light
masses coupling to photons thereby contributing additionally to the photon
propagator. such a contribution to the propagator can be related to the
contribution to the r parameter we have just considered . this is precisely
how g-2 is calculated in the literature [19]. in this work the contribution to
g-2 for the muon , av , is given by

av = z4m2

dtk(t)r(t)

(37)

where r(t) is the r-ratio and k(t) is a known function.
however , the manner in which zero mass scalar partons enter the low
energy description of r(t) ( where t is the centre of mass energy ) is subtle.
at low energy there is mixing between our zero mass partonic pions and the
pseudoscalar channel . this will generate a higher mass state with quantum
numbers of the pion in addition to the the usual goldstone pion  associated
with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. since we cannot calculate
the mass of this non-perturbatively generated extra state we can only use
experiment to glean its mass. the particle data book lists the rst additional
state with pion quantum numbers at 1.3 gev. at low energies then we must
use this state to calculate the extra contribution to the photon self energy or
the r parameter as the usual pions contribution is already accounted for in
the standard treatment of hadronic contributions to g-2. the threshold for
the contribution of this state then starts at 2.6 gev. this puts us in the
perturbative qcd regime.
before computing the extra contributions a few remarks are in order:
1) the low energy regime, 0.8-2.0 gev, has to be gleaned from experiment
as perturbative qcd can not be used . the contribution to av from this
region as listed in table 2 of [19] is (1404  100).1011 as this is evaluated
from experimental data, one cannot dierentiate the contributions from qcd
and our theory . 2) perturbative qcd is used for t > 2gev2 ( table 1
of [19]) except for the threshold regions which are populated by numerous

19

resonances, where again one has to only rely on experimental data, and can
not dierentiate between our theory and qcd. these regions are: 3.3- 3.6
gev, 3.6 - 4.9 gev and 9 - 14 gev.

thus it is only for regions for which estimates are made via perturba-
in
tive qcd that comparison between this theory and qcd is possible.
respect of the foregoing discussion this region for us must begin at t > 2.6
gev. we briey sketch how the additional contribution can be evaluated
i) k(t) goes as 1/t2. assuming
for our theory in the region 2.6 - 3.1 gev:
r(t) = r0 and using eqn(10) we can get the two contributions for 1.4-2.6
gev and 2.6-3.1 gev for qcd. the partial contribution for the region , 2.6
-3.1 gev is found to be 1/10 of the total.
ii) the extra contribution to
r assuming zero mass pionic partons is r = 1/4 whereas the qcd con-
tribution is r0 = 2. thus the fractional extra contribution is 1/8.
iii)
this is further down when we take into account the mass of the excited
state (1.3 gev). a rough estimate is provided by mutiplying by the phase
space factor (1  4m 2/t) = 0.17 taken at the average value 2.85 gev for
t. the total extra contribution for the region 2.6-3.1 gev works out to
1.2 1011. below we display the contributions and errors for various regions:

the extra contribution of our theory falls within the sum of the theoretical
and the systematic errors . the error in the low energy region , 0.8-2 gev is
roughly 100 1011. by comparison, all our extra contributions are negligible.
we are therefore led to the conclusion that g-2 for the muon despite being
a very high precision measurement of the charged-particle content of theories
cannot dierentiate between qcd and our theory - a rather non trivial result.

where  = (12s2)/cs) with s being sinw and c2 = 1s2. the contribution
to the hadronic width of z-boson due to the extra scalars can be calculated
easily:

at sin2  .25, this works out to roughly 4.5% of the total width z. the
high precision lep data only allows total uncertainty of about .3%.
this immediately rules out the extended version where the chiral sym-
metry in the extended sector is spontaneously broken or where the chiral
symmetry in the extended sector is manifest with low mass for the multiplet,
or where chiral symmetry is fully broken but with light masses for the chiral
scalars.

in conclusion, by explicit construction of an alternative theory to qcd for
the strong interactions we have found that all precision tests for qcd except
forthe z width cannot select between the two theories. only by extending the
theories to the full electrweak standard model do we nd an unambiguous
support in favour of qcd from the z width. this underscores the fact that
most tests and vindications of qcd that are to be found in archival refrences
in the literature are just not adequate and that only the z width is precise
enough to be the nal arbiter[7].

a dierent version of this theory where the chiral multiplet mass of more
than one half the z mass will be exempt from this problem this is considered
in the next section.

5 massive scenario

the main conclusion from our analysis of the massless scenario is that m <
mz/2 is not viable. in this section we consider the opposite scenario that
m > mz/2. before looking at the signatures for such a scenario, we rst

21

investigate the constraints on the model by flavour changing neutral cur-
rents(fcnc) as well by the oblique parameters s, t & u.

5.1 flavour changing neutral currents

in the standard model f = 2 processes like the ones mediated by

are severely suppressed compared to their generic values. while these
processes could be generically of order gf , they actually turn out to be
of order g2
f . this remarkable suppression, borne out by data, is due to the
unitarity of the so-called ckm matrix for three generations. in our model too
fcnc processes must be likewise suppressed; otherwise they are immediately
ruled out. a natural question to ask is whether there is an analogue of the
ckm matrix for our model too. as in the standard model we introduce
mass-eigenstate quark-elds through

r = t 
r
l = s
l

(40)

now it is important to see whether fcnc are introduced in our model.

we must have

lyukawa = fab 

a( = i5~  ~)

b

(41)

in order that the interaction preserve su(2)l- invariance. here  is the dirac
eld. on splitting the dirac eld into its left and right-handed components
and rotating them into the mass-eigenstate basis one obtains

(42)

now there are potential fcnc terms even at tree level because of the rst two
terms in the above expression. however, the contributions to tree level from
fcnc due to  and 0 exactly cancel, and there are no tree level fcnc
in this model. this is true both for f = 2 and f = 1 processes. this
is unlike the situation in generic two higgs doublet models, where often the
couplings have to be ne-tuned to keep tree-level fcnc under control. this
is because in such models, the analogs of  and 0 are not mass-eigenstates;
instead, the mass-eigenstates are linear cominations of (h0, , 0) where h0
is the higgs of the minimal standard model. this is again due to the fact

22

that the most general higgs potential that is su(2)  u(1)-invariant, allows
such a mixing(of course the analogs of () are mass-eigenstates even in such
models). on the other hand in our model the higgs-chiral multiplet coupling
term has to be su(2)l  su(2)r-invariant, which only allows

||2  (2 + ~2)

(43)

and this keeps (, 0) as mass eigenstates even after ssb, except for the small
mixing eects described in sec.3.3.

this cancellation of fcnc due to the tree-level f = 1 vertices persists
even for the one-loop contributions of the type shown below the fcnc
generated by the last two terms of eqn() are more complicated and involve
deeper analysis. the generic contributions to ds  sd involve box diagrams
of two types:a) w  exchange and b) exchanges shown below in addition,
unlike the standard model case, there are several f = 2 operators to deal
with. we shall illustrate this for the particular case of ds  sd by adopting
the notation that d1s2  s3d4 shall be denoted by (1, 2, 3, 4). thus
the case of g.1 is (l, r, l, r).in principle 16 possibilities are possible.but
for the w exchange, at the w-vertex only ls are allowed. this way the
number of possibilities is cut down considerably. also, diagrams where the
internal i-quark propagator connects quark elds of dierent helicities are
suppressed by m2
w . thus the independent classes to be counted are: for
the w -exchange, (l, r, l, r) and for the -exchanges, (l, l, , ) and
(r, r, , ).

if we had considered fcnc for urcr  crur, the rst of these eqns would

thus we see that natural suppression of all fcnc operators would re-

theorems(which are quite easily proved) to show that this can happen only
when the matrix f is proportional to the identity-matrix.

it is also clear that these have to be diagonal unitary matrices.

this is the unique solution to natural fcnc suppression in this model. it
is instructive to pause and reect whether this manner of fcnc suppression
amounts to ne-tuning in this model. a particular solution is not a ne-
tuned solution if it enhances the symmetries of the system. in the absence
of su(2)  u(1) couplings our solution indeed enhances the symmetry from
su(2)lsu(2)r to su(3)horsu(2)lsu(2)r. thus if the standard model
is not truly fundamental but only an eective description, then there could
be an intermediate phase(at scales above the weak scale) where nature may
have preferred su(3)horsu(2)lsu(2)r. if that is so, the chiral-multiplet
may be even more fundamental than what we may have been thinking.
lastly, we see that our solution to the suppression of fcnc can not
generically yield cp-conservation. the minimal cp-nonconservation can be
achieved by taking w (1,2)

to be unit matrices.

are also indebted to him for many useful discussions.

recall that the various (p 2) are mass and wavefunction renormalised. be-
cause (0) = 0, mass renormalisations for , z are automatically taken
care of. to discuss wavefunction renormalisation, we compute (p 2) where
 denotes dierentiation wrt p 2. the result is

f1(a) = 2/9  8/3a2 + 16/3a3 arctg(1/2a)

it should be noted that f1(a)a  0. the fully renormalised quantities
renormalised at p 2 = m 2 denoted by (p 2)(m ) are given by

(p 2)(m ) = (p 2)  (m 2)  (p 2  m 2)(m 2)

(64)

the case m = 0 will be explicitly worked out as the limit a   could be
problematic for a numerical evaluation. the result is

(p 2)(0) =

5.3 other precision tests for the model

: the coupling of the chiral multiplet to the electroweak bosons given by
eqns(6-7) leads to additional contributions to various processes of the elec-
troweak theory. one of the sensitive tests for qcd is the value of the r-
parameter. as the cross-section for the pair production of the scalars at
lep energies is of the order of a 1pb, the r-parameter is not very sensi-
tive to the presence of the scalars. the other important precision test is
the g-2 for muons. there are two types of additional contributions to g-2
that arise. one is due to the enhanced ultraviolet degrees of freedom and

28

m2

m2


the other due to additional hadronic interactions . the contributions due to
the former arise out of the modication of the photon propagation function
the analytic result is g = 
for m = 45gev this amounts to
2
g = 4  1014 and hence insignicant. the shift due to the modication
of hadronic interactions is much harder to estimate precisely. one should
expect very little dierence between qcd and the extended theories here
because of the expected decoupling of massive particles. one expects the
additional interactions to produce changes in g-2 at the level of g2
1
2 times
the dominant hadronic contributions. this amounts to less than 2 parts in
1000 of the dominant hadronic contributions and is hence much less than the
known theoretical uncertainties in g-2.

6 four jet events

as mentioned in the introduction, though the aleph collaboration has now
retracted its earlier claims of having seen excess four jet events, many features
reported by them earlier follow naturally and in a virtually parameter-free
manner from our model. we nd it worthwhile to present them here as
generic features of four jet events for our model.

in our model one expects excess four jet events identied with the decay
products of the scalars which have no couplings to the leptons. hence one
of the characterstic features of such four jet events in our model are: a) no
leptons with high transverse momentum wrt the jets are expected. b) no
events of the type  + cs and  +    are expected.
the following table gives in pb the cross-sections for e+e  0(neut)
and to +(char) as a function of s and scalar mass. taking into account
the fcnc constraint that the scalars couple nearly equally to all avours,
the branching ratios for having at least 2 b(b) jets (r2b) and four b(b) jets
(r4b) are also given.

in our model the widths of the scalars are : ,0

y
with a top mass of 170 gev, only ve avours contribute to the decay of
neutrals, leading to a width of about 1.88 gev. likewise, the latter works
out to 0.75 gev/avour, and the width of charged scalars is about 1.5 gev.
these should be the expected widths for the di-jet mass-sum distribution.
we present a comparison of the expected properties of four jet events in our
model with what one would expect from some other models in the following
table.

7 other experimental signatures

in this section we shall discuss some other experimental signatures for the
extended theories that appear feasible at the moment.

7.1 real photon processes

in electron-proton(ep) scattering experiments, by restricting to suitable re-
gions of scattered electron angles and energies, one can get almost real pho-
tons. we now describe the new events predicted by the extended model in
those regions.

the dominant process in ep-scattering is essentially electron-quark scat-
tering (eq) which manifests itself as a 2 jet event with activity throughout the
rapidity region. the advantages of working with nearly real photons is that
this dominant process is kinematically forbidden. indeed, the leading order
process now is q > qg which experimentally manifests itself as 2+1(the
gluon jet, the scattered quark jet and the beam jet) jet topology with no
rapidity gaps. in the extended theory we now have the additional process
q > q(). these events are characterised by 2+2 jet topologies where
the last two jets arise out of the decay of (), and there will be signicant
rapidity gaps in the (q, ), (, beam) regions. now the relative fraction of
these events to the dominant qcd process is  n 
g = 1/12 apart from some
phase space suppression. this is a sizeable eect.

7.2

ep scattering

in ep scattering the dominant qcd process is the 2 jet event with no rapidity
gap produced by the subprocess eq > eq. of the 2 jets, the quark jet is
produced back to back with the electron in the eq centre of mass frame. in the
extended model, the dominant process is eq > eq(). the distinguishing

31

features of these new events are that only the rapidity region between the
beam jet and the quark jet is lled. also, the quark jet is no longer back
to back with the electron in the eq centre of mass frame and can in fact be
produced at suciently small angles.

7.3 pp(p) scattering

in addition to the dominant one gluon exchange, now one can exchange the
scalar particles leading to a slightly dierent angular distribution for jets.
the scalar admixture will roughly be a fraction n 
g and could easily be
about 3%. another way this could manifest is in a slightly dierent estimate
for s in pp(p) reactions compared to e+e or ep reactions.
