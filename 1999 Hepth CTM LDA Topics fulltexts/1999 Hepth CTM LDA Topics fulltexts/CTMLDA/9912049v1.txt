abstract

we show how non-near horizon p-brane theories can be obtained from two embedding constraints in
a at higher dimensional space with 2 time directions. in particular this includes the construction
of d3 branes from a at 12-dimensional action, and m2 and m5 branes from 13 dimensions. the
worldvolume actions are determined by constant forms in the higher dimension, reduced to the
usual expressions by lagrange multipliers. the formulation aords insight in the global aspects of
the spacetime geometries and makes contact with recent work on two-time physics.

1 introduction

it is well known that the description of an ads space in d dimensions is facilitated by
embedding it in a at d + 1 dimensional space with two time directions. the embedding is
obtained by one constraint and gives a manifestly so(d  1, 2) symmetric description of the
global properties of the geometry. any choice of coordinates on the d-dimensional manifold
will break this manifest symmetry.

an even more obvious example of extending the dimension for a better understanding of
the geometry is the description of the sphere geometry sd in a d + 1 dimensional at space.
the two examples above are combined in [1], where the adsp+2  sn1 near-horizon
geometry of p branes in d = p + n + 1 dimensions is described starting from a at (d + 2)-
dimensional space. two constraints are imposed, which respectively reduce p + 3 dimensions
to the adsp+2 manifold and n dimensions to the sn1 sphere. the borninfeld actions
for the near-horizon theories of various branes are obtained from those in a at (d + 2)-
dimensional space by adding terms with two lagrange multipliers, imposing the embedding
constraints. the wesszumino (wz) terms in the actions are obtained from a (p + 2) form,
which is integrated over a (p + 2)-dimensional manifold which has the worldvolume as its
boundary.

it is interesting therefore to ask whether the full spacetime metric of a brane may be
isometrically embedded in ied,2. apart from its possible relevance to the existence of exotic
theories with two times, it is possible that isometric embeddings of d-brane and m-brane
metrics as submanifolds of at space may have some technical advantages for quantising
particles or strings moving in these backgrounds, since one may think of them as free particles
or strings subjected to non-linear constraints. one might try to implement diracs procedure
for quantization with constraints.

we will generalise the constructions of [1] for non-near horizon brane geometries. we
will show that even if the geometry is not a product of an ads with a sphere, the brane
geometry can be embedded in a at (d + 2)-dimensional space with two time directions.
the two constraints are in this case not expressed on separate coordinates of the embedding
space, but involve a non-trivial mixing of the coordinates. also the forms for the wz terms
are obtained in this picture. for that construction, we follow [3] where it is proposed that a p
brane evolving in a space with two times should couple to a (p + 3)-form eld strength. the
eld strength is contracted to a (p + 2)-form which can be used for the wz term. to do this
contraction we will have to introduce an extra vector eld which only in the near-horizon
limit will be of an elegant form.

one may wonder whether the whole geometry cannot be embedded with just one extra
dimension and why we need two time directions in the embedding space. first of all it has
been shown [4] that the embedding of a surface in a at space of co-dimension 1 imposes, by

1

use of the einstein equations of motion, that the surface has constant curvature, if the surface
has dimensionality d > 2. this corresponds to the familiar cases of the embedding of spheres
and (anti)de sitter manifolds in at spaces with only one more dimension. therefore, in
order to embed a brane background, we need at least two extra dimensions.

to determine the signature of the metric of the embedding space we use the following
argument. an interesting aspect of brane spacetimes is that they are not globally hyperbolic4.
according to penrose [5], a global isometric embedding into a at space with one time, i.e.
into ien,1, is not possible for a spacetime which is not globally hyperbolic. one needs at least
two times. penroses argument is essentially that the restriction of the time coordinate x 0
of ien,1 to the embedded spacetime m would serve as a time-function on m, i.e., a function
which increases along every future directed timelike curve. moreover, if the embedding is
suitably regular, the level sets (constant time slices) would actually serve as cauchy surfaces
on m, implying global hyperbolicity. no such obstruction arises for embeddings into at
spacetimes with more than one time.

what we will describe in this paper is therefore a minimal embedding of general brane

backgrounds in at spaces with two extra dimensions and (d, 2) signature.

in the case of particles in brane backgrounds, the constraints determining the embedding
in a space with two time directions can be studied in the hamiltonian formalism leading to
canonical quantization. we rst treat these constraints as second class constraints, nding
the corresponding system of dirac brackets. furthermore, as discussed in [6, 7], particle
systems in spaces with two times can also be associated with rst class constraints closing
an sp(2) algebra (the local version of the sp(2) relating coordinates and momenta in phase
space). we will obtain these constraints. however, it turns out that the action for a particle
in a brane background can be written as a gauge-xed form of the actions constructed in [6]
only in the case of conformally at metric, i.e. in the near-horizon limit.

in section 2 we give the embedding of the geometry, rst in general and then comment
on the near-horizon approximation, and on connecting regions separated by coordinate sin-
gularities. the worldvolume actions will be constructed in section 3. the essential step
in that section is the construction of the forms. first, general results for the electric eld
strengths are given, before completing the construction for the cases d3, m2 and m5 sep-
arately. in section 4 we will give the dirac analysis of constraints in the particle case and
make connection with the works of [6].

4a space is called globally hyperbolic if it possesses a cauchy surface

2 embedding: the geometry

in this section we describe the embedding of a so(n) invariant p-brane in a (d + 2) =
(n + p + 3)-dimensional spacetime. we will obtain the embedding by demanding that the
known metric of the brane is obtained from a at (d, 2) metric. thus, we demand that
the embedding is isometric.5 with an ansatz where the d + 2 at coordinates are written
in terms of a particular mixing of hyperspherical and horospherical coordinates, 3 of these
coordinates are left as unknown functions of the coordinate r describing the distance from
the brane. this leads to two constraints, as we rst show for a rather general type of metric
in d dimensions with so(p, 1)  so(n) symmetry. then we specialize to the metric for
non-dilatonic d- and m-branes. in the third subsection, we look to the structure beyond the
horizon to get insight in the global structure.

2.1 the general case

the p-brane original spacetime is d dimensional, and the geometry can generally be de-
scribed by a metric of the form

ds2 = a(r)2hdt2 + dxp.dxpi + b(r)2dr2 + c(r)2d2

n1 ,

(2.1)

where dxp.dxp is the p-dimensional spacelike part on the worldvolume, and d2
n1 is the
n-sphere metric. the metric has manifest poincare invariance on the world volume, as well
as so(n) invariance in the transverse space.

now we consider the embedding space, for which we consider cartesian coordinates x m ,

with m = 0, . . . , d + 1, which we divide as follows

x 
x p+1
x p+2
x 

 = 0, . . . , p

 = p + 3, . . . , d + 1 .

x m = 


the at metric with signature (d, 2) can be written as

(2.2)

(2.3)

ds2 = (dx 0)2 + (dx 1)2 + ... + (dx p+1)2  (dx p+2)2 + ...(dx d+1)2 .

5an embedding is said to be isometric at a point p i g(u, v ) = g(fu, fv ), where (m, g) is the manifold
to embed, (m , g) embedding space, f is the embedding (f : (m, g)  (m , g)), f is the dierential of f ,
and u and v are two elements of tpm [8, 9]. this basically means that length and angles are preserved
in mapping from tpm to tpm . when chart induced bases are used both on m and m , we have for the
isometric condition g = x a

,x b

,gab.

3

from the viewpoint of the embedding, the (d + 2)-dimensional coordinates x m are the
embedding functions. hence, the d-dimensional geometry will be described by two con-
straints in the (d + 2)-dimensional coordinates, in the same way that a sphere s2 embedded
in r3 is described by one constraint in the 3-dimensional coordinates, namely the equation
x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = r2 in cartesian coordinates. we now describe one way to obtain these
two constraints. we start by making a change of coordinates in the (d + 2)-dimensional
spacetime so as to make manifest a subgroup so(p, 1)  so(n)  so(p + n + 1, 2). this is
achieved by using a mixture of hyperspherical and horospherical coordinates {, z, x, , n},
as follows

x p+2  x p+1 =
x p+2 + x p+1 = z +

,


z

x  = 

x
z

x  = n ,

xx,

(2.4)

where n parametrise6 the sphere sn1. with this change of coordinates, the metric reads

2

ds2 = d2 +

z2 hdxdx + dz2i + d2 + 2dndn .

in the comparison between (2.5) and (2.1) we identify dxdx with dt2 + dxp.dxp and
dndn with d2
n1. then ,  and z are functions of r to be determined. the comparison
gives

= a(r)

 = c(r)

z
d2 +

2
z2 dz2 + d2 = b(r)2dr2 .

(2.6)

these encode the two aforementioned constraints, for we reduce from three degrees of free-
dom (, z, ) to one (r). the dierential equation can further be written as

(2.5)

(2.7)

as p(n)2 = 1 and hence, the metric on this sphere, d2

6the n can be seen as the cartesian coordinates in rn so that they dene the unit sphere sn1
n1 is given by the euclidean metric on rn
restricted to the hyperspherical hypersurface . the relation between n and the usual hyperspher-
is e.g. for p = 3: n6 = sin() sin(1) sin(2) sin(3) sin(4),
ical angular coordinates (, 1, ..., n2),
n11 = sin() sin(1) sin(2) sin(3) cos(4), n10 = sin() sin(1) sin(2) cos(3), n9 = sin() sin(1) cos(2),
n8 = sin() cos(1), n7 = cos().

4

where the prime denotes dierentiation with respect to r. hence, we can impose the con-
straints while making the coordinate transformation (or, in other words, while dening the
embedding functions) by replacing (2.4) by

x   x p+2  x p+1 = a(r)
x +  x p+2 + x p+1 = f (r) + a(r)xx
x  = a(r)x
x  = c(r)n .

(2.8)

we can, furthermore, express the constraints in terms of the x a coordinates only. de-
noting the inverse function with an overbar, i.e., f(f ) = f (f) = identity, we can write
r = a(x p+2  x p+1). thus, our two constraints are

1(x +, x , x ) = x x +  x x  x f (a(x )) = 0

2(x , x ) = x

(x )2 hc(a(x ))i2

= 0 .

(2.9)

these constraints are thus determined by the functions a, c and f . the latter is determined
up to a constant by (2.7) in terms of a, b and c. note that so far there is no denition
of the radial variable r. we can use dierent parametrizations. e.g. it will turn out that
in some cases it is useful to take a or c itself as the radial variable. thus in the rst case
one may take the equations here with a(r) = r, and in the second case c(r) = r. in the
standard brane cases, the functions a, b and c will take the form of some harmonic function
to some power in the transverse space to the brane. we will further adopt the name r for
that transverse coordinate, use just the name a for the parameter in the rst mentioned
parametrization, and use r for the radial coordinate such that c(r) = r.

2.2 non-dilatonic d- and m-branes

from now on we will assume that the functions a, b and c are indeed harmonic functions
in n dimensions with a at limit at r  . for non-dilatonic d- and m-branes, they are of
the following form

1

r(cid:19)

h = (cid:18)1 +
a(r) = h  1
b(r) = h

c(r) = rh

here a priori r > 0 and r = 0 corresponds to the horizon, but we will come back to this in
section 2.3.2. the values for p,  and

for these branes are summarised in table 1. under these conditions, the second constraint

with an explicit form for the functions a, b and c we can evaluate the function f .

which is dened for 0 < x  1. this means that f (r) is well dened in the region r > 0,
which is what we were looking for.

the near-horizon approximation. it is well known that the isometry group of adsn, i.e.
so(n  1, 2), acts as the conformal group on an (n  1)-dimensional lorentzian manifold
(in particular on its conformal boundary). it has also been known for some time [10] that
ads spacetimes arise as the geometry of some bps branes in the near-horizon limit. for
instance, for the m2, m5 and d3 branes, the near-horizon geometry is adsp+2  sdp2.

6

therefore, if we study these branes on the backgrounds of their own near-horizon geometries,
conformal eld theories on the branes worldvolumes should arise. in [1], such a study was
performed by embedding the near-horizon supergravity solutions in a (d + 2)-dimensional
spacetime. as we discussed in the previous section, for the three mentioned solutions the
geometry takes a form like (2.1) with a, b and c given by (2.10). for small r, we get

b =

(2.15)

so that for the three cases, the embedding functions (2.8) reduce to those used in [1].

2.3 passing through the horizon

using the embedding (2.8) we can now study the global properties of the brane geometries.
before considering the higher dimensional d- and m-branes, let us rst look at the easier
and lower dimensional example of the extreme reissnernordstrm (rn) black hole (a large
list of embedding functions for other solutions of general relativity is given in [11]).

2.3.1 example: extreme reissnernordstrm black hole

the rn black hole ts our general embedding scheme with d = 4 and p = 0,  = 1,
w = 1. here, rather than working with the radial variable r as in (2.10), we use the variable
r, which, as mentioned at the end of section 2.1, has the property c(r) = r. then the
functions a and b are given by a(r) = b(r)1 = 1  1/r. the variable r is just shifted
with respect to r, as r  r + 1, and the horizon is now at r = 1 and r = 0 corresponds to
the singularity. using (2.7), we then nd

frn (r) =

1

r  1  3r  r2  4 log |r  1| .

the near-horizon limit of the extreme rn metric is ads2  s2. ads spaces are naturally

dened by their embedding. figure 1 shows ads2 using two dierent parametrizations.

right: hyperspherical coordinates ( x 0 = 1 + u2 cos v, x 1 = 1 + u2 sin v, x 2 = u). note
x  = x 1  x 2.

notice that the horospherical embedding seems to have problems at x  = 0, because this
parametrization goes bad as a = x   0. this is just an artifact of the parametrization and
is not a feature of the embedded surface itself, as can be seen from the other parametrization.
the holes in the left gure are due to limits in the range of t and r. e.g. we have to start
from a nite r > 0 in order to have no singularities in the functions.

the entire reissnernordstrm black hole geometry can be drawn in a similar fashion
using parametrization (2.8) as is shown in gure 2. note that we used a slightly dierent
orientation as in the ads2 pictures.

we can read o the following global features from the picture. the geometry consists of
2 distinct regions: region i, the asymptotically at region for r > 1 which corresponds to
x  > 0. for big r the surface attens and x   1, which is the at limit. region ii is
the region inside the horizon (x  < 0). the singularity (r = 0) corresponds to x   .
the two regions are connected in an ads-throat (compare with gure 1). it seems that these
two regions are disconnected, the constant time lines all diverge near x  = 0 and never cross
the horizon. as in the ads case, this is just an artifact of the parametrization. actually,
we know that the near-horizon geometry is equivalent to ads2, which has no problems at
its horizon.

to infalling lightlike geodesics. in the v parametrization they pass through the horizon into
the interior region and end at the singularity instead of diverging at the horizon

one of the features of ads spaces is that they admit closed timelike curves, which can
be clearly seen in gure 1. the usual remedy for this is to consider the covering space cads
instead of ads itself. looking at gure 2 we see that our rn black hole geometry suers
from the same problem, it admits closed timelike curves (remember that x 0 and x 2 both are
timelike directions). again this is remedied by considering the covering space. the result
of this of course is that the space then consists of multiple universes.
it is this covering
space that is depicted in the familiar penrose-carter diagram for the extreme rn black hole
(gure 3).

in text books one usually shows that the horizon of a black hole is regular by adopting
special coordinates in which you can follow the geodesics through the horizon inside the
black hole, the so-called advanced (or retarded) finkelstein coordinates. we can do the
same thing with our embedding as is shown in gure 2.

2.3.2 non-dilatonic branes

as discussed in [12], the general brane solution case (2.10) can be divided in two classes: p
odd or p even.

let us rst consider the p odd case. in the region r > 0, the exterior region, the function
if we take a to be our new radial
a(r) is analytic and positive and vanishes as r  0.
variable instead of r, we see that a can be continued through the horizon to negative a [12].

10

the range of a is from -1 to 1. the analytic extension of the metric is

ds2 = a2dxdx +(cid:16)1  ap+1(cid:17) 2

 (cid:20)w2(cid:16)1  ap+1(cid:17)2

a2da2 + d2(cid:21) ,

which is even in a. this leads to

f (a) =  w

(cid:17) + 2bap+1(cid:16) p

p+1, 2

(cid:17)i .

(2.16)

(2.17)

the embedding functions (2.8) are then odd in a. this means that the embedded space is
symmetric around the horizon and completely nonsingular. (up to a factor, a corresponds
to  in [12], where the same continuation was discussed.) the penrose diagram for these p
odd brane geometries is show in gure 3. for the non-dilatonic branes, the d3 and m5 t
this picture. the embedding (gure 4) nicely shows these features. it is clearly visible there
is no interior region, just two symmetric exterior regions connected in the ads-throat as
was expected from the penrose diagram.

in the p even case, the metric and embedding functions are neither even or odd.

it
is useful in this case to adopt so-called schwarzschild coordinates, which are dened by
r = r + 1. in these coordinates the horizon (which still is a coordinate singularity) is
at r = 1. at r = 0 there is a true coordinate singularity (the radial variable used in
the reissnernordstrm example actually was a schwarzschild variable). expressed in this
coordinate, a(r) can be continued through the horizon into negative a and its range is
{, 1}. as already stated in [12], the penrose diagram for these spaces is equivalent to
the extreme reissnernordstrm diagram (see gure 3).
the embedding of the m2-brane metric illustrates these features (gure 5). the ex-
pression (2.14) of f is well dened only in the region r > 1. it is not possible to nd a
continuous expression for f valid in both regions (0 < r  1 and r > 1). but, nevertheless,
a continuous embedding is obtained using in the interior region

notice that the global structure of the m2 indeed resembles that of the extreme rn black
hole (compare gure 5 and 2)

as in the rn case, we can directly read o some of the global properties from the gures.
again the spaces admit closed timelike curves or, as it is put in [2], they are wrapped in
time. the alternative is of course again taking the covering space, resulting in an innite
stack of connected universes.

to show that the horizon is completely regular, we can reparametrise the embedding
in finkelstein coordinates as in the case of the rn black hole. figure 6 shows part of the
embedding of the m5-brane metric using these finkelstein coordinates. the constant v lines
(v is the advanced finkelstein time coordinate v = t + r as dened in most text books)
correspond to infalling lightlike geodesics and they clearly pass the horizon into the next
region.

3 the brane action

we would like to write the action of a brane placed in the background of other branes using
the embedding in the d + 2 = n + p + 3 spacetime. a typical (schematic) form of the action
is

sp+1 = zw
+ zw

dp+1q det g +zb (w =b)

(p+2) +

dp+1[11(x +, x , x ) + 22(x , x )] ,

(3.1)

where w is the (p + 1)-dimensional world volume of the brane. the expression for g diers
for each case. for example, for dp-branes g  x m x n m n + f, with f the eld
strength of the gauge eld living on the world volume of the brane. the elds 1, 2 are
two lagrange multipliers implementing the constraints (2.9). (p+2)(x m ) is a function of
the forms coupling to the brane, such that it reduces to the appropriate wesszumino term
when projected on the physical hypersurface determined by the constraints. the explicit
form of (p+2) will be determined, for the non-dilatonic d3-, m2- and m5-brane cases, in the
next subsections.

3.1 embedding the eld strength

let us now study the embedding in the (d + 2)-dimensional space of the eld strengths
appearing in the wesszumino term of the action (3.1). we will follow the suggestion of
[3]. the idea would be that a brane (extended in p spatial directions) uctuating in a
spacetime with two times should evolve in both the time directions, and therefore couple to
a (p+3)-form eld strength. we assume therefore that the (d + 2)-dimensional theory can
be coupled to rank p + 3 electric eld strengths ke, and to rank n magnetic eld strengths
km, coupling to branes with p space-like directions evolving in 2 times. we then ask that
the rank p + 2 eld strengths f coupled to p-branes in d-dimensional supergravity be a
restriction of ke (ke + km for the d3-brane case) to the d dimensional hypersurface .

14

this ansatz is the most natural one for the d3-brane, because in this case the 10-dimensional
self-dual eld strength is extended to a self-dual eld strength in 12 dimensions. if there
were a supergravity theory in d = 12, the bosonic conguration with at (10, 2) space and a
constant self-dual eld strength would solve the equations of motion. this is obvious for the
maxwell equation (there can be no chernsimons terms built from a 5 form potential in 12
dimensions and so the maxwell equation would take the standard form), but for the einstein
equations it is only true because the eld strength is self-dual. in a d-dimensional spacetime
with euclidean or kleinian signature (i.e. zero or two times) a self-dual eld strength has a
vanishing energy momentum tensor for d = 4 mod 4. (for lorentzian signature it is d = 2
mod 4). what this would mean is that the ten-dimensional d3-brane solution would just be
the projection to a complicated hypersurface of an almost trivial 12-dimensional supergravity
solution.

let us start by analysing how an electric (p + 2)-form eld strength f (p+2) coupling to
a p-brane gets embedded in the (d + 2)-dimensional space. our aim is to obtain f as a
restriction of a p + 3-form k (p+3) to the d-dimensional hypersurface .

a general non-dilatonic brane is described in d dimensions by the elds [13]

ds2 = h  2

 = const. = 0 ,

1 +    + dx2

dp2i ,

(3.2)

with the notations of section 2. the only non-vanishing components of the eld strength
f = dg, are those related with the components given above by antisymmetry. taking that
into account, we can write the (electric) eld strength as

where prime denotes dierentiation with respect to r.

f = (p + 1)apadr  dt  dx1      dxp ,

(3.3)

to nd the embedding, we start by considering a constant (p+3)-form in d+2 dimensions

(3.4)

primed indices run over  = 0, . . . , p + 2. in order to get a rank (p + 2) eld strength, we
contract ke with a vector eld v , with components v = v m ( 
xm ), which we take to be
arbitrary (there is a sign ambiguity in this contraction; we chose to make it on the left, i.e.
a

). such a contraction yields

where we dened v   v p+2  v p+1. next we impose that ke(v )| = f . to determine
v m , we use the ansatz v m = (v , v ) = ((r)x , v ). because ke only has components
in the longitudinal directions, v  stays undetermined. when the eld strength also includes
a magnetic part, this v  comes into play, as we will see in the next section. it follows that,
in order for (3.6) to match with (3.3), (r) has to obey

(r)(

w2 , which matches with

3.2 d3-brane embedding

the 10-dimensional wesszumino term is the integral of the self-dual eld strength f that
couples to the d3-branes solution of the type iib supergravity theory. for the 12-dimensional
theory we construct a self-dual 6 form k, i.e.

where 12 is the volume form on the 12-dimensional spacetime. our aim is to obtain f as
a restriction of k to the 10 dimensional surface . the d3-brane is described by the elds

 k  k = 12|k|2,

(3.10)

16

(3.2) introduced in the previous subsection, with p + 1 =  = 4, d = 10.
in this case,
the only non vanishing components of the eld strength f = dg are those related to the
components in (3.2) by either antisymmetry or self-duality. taking that into account we can
write the (anti)self-dual eld strength as

f = h h 2dt  dx  dy  dz  dr + h h  1

2q|g|d  d1  d2  d3  d4,

where prime denotes dierentiation with respect to r. in terms of the embedding functions,
the last expression reads

(3.11)

(3.12)
where (5)  sin()4 sin(1)3 sin(2)2 sin(3)d  d1  ...  d4 is the volume form on the
unit 5-sphere.

f = 4aa3dt  dx  dy  dz  dr + 4(5) ,

to nd the embedding, we start by considering a constant self-dual six-form in twelve

dimensions

k =

(

1...  dx 

5 + 1...6dx 1  dx 1...  dx 6),

(3.13)

we have written k in a manifestly so(4, 2)  so(6) invariant form. in order to get a rank
5 eld strength, we contract, as we have done for the general electric case, k with a vector
eld v , with components v = v m (

xm ). such a contraction yields



k(v ) =

5 + 1...6v 1dx 2  ...  dx 6) .

(3.14)

then, we reduce the resulting 5 form to the 10-dimensional hypersurface by using the em-
bedding functions (2.8). by requiring the matching k(v )| = f , we get the constraints for
our vector eld v . the resulting 5 form k(v ) is the looked-for wesszumino form 5.
let us analyse separately the two terms in the right hand side of (3.12), (3.13) and (3.14).
the electric part has already been studied in the general case in the previous subsection. in
this case it gives v  = (r)x  with

(r) =

2

2(x x)3  x m xm

.

(3.15)

the angular part in (3.13) can be rewritten in terms of the radial coordinate r and of

the angular coordinates ,i (i = 1,   , 4) as

1...6dx 1      dx 6 = c c 5gs5dr  d  d1      d4

= c c 5dr  5 ,

17

(3.16)

where gs5 is the determinant of the metric of the unit 5-sphere in polar coordinates.. in order
for the second term in (3.14) to match with the second term in (3.12), we have to require
that the vector v points in the radial direction when decomposed on the r, , i basis, that
is

(3.17)

(3.18)

this gives

1...6v 1dx 2  ...  dx 6 = c c 5v  r

the matching with (3.12) requires

v  r

x  = (c c 5)1 ,

which is solved, with the ansatz v  = (r)x , by7

v  = c 6x  = (1 + r4) 3

2 x  .

we notice that (r = 0) = (r = 0) = 1, so that in the near-horizon approximation we
have v m = x m and k(v ) becomes the potential for the 12 dimensional self-dual form k
(up to a constant), making contact with the work in [1]. the general form of the vector eld
in terms of the 12-dimensional coordinates is

v

v  =

(3.21)

3.3 m2-brane embedding

for m2 the wesszumino form is the rank 4 (electric) eld strength f . we require that this
eld strength be a restriction of ke to the 11-dimensional hypersurface.

the fundamental m2 brane is described in 11 dimensions by the elds (3.2) with p+1 = 3,

 = 6, and f = dg an electric eld strength, i.e.

f = 3aa2dx0  dx1  dx2  dr .

(3.22)

repeating the general analysis, we require that f = k(v )|, where k is a constant

5-form in 13 dimensions

4a2f + r2(1 + 2r6)

(3.24)

and v  stays undetermined. written in terms of 13 dimensional coordinates, the general
form of the vector eld v m is

v m = (cid:16)v 

, v (cid:17) =  

8x 

x x [3 + 2(x x)3]  4x m xm

, v ! .

(3.25)

the 4 of (3.1) is k(v ).

3.4 m5-brane embedding

let us now perform a similar construction for the m5-brane background. we start with the
11 dimensional metric describing the geometry of the m5-brane

ds2 = h 1/3(dt2 + dx2

1 +    dx2

5) + h 2/3(dr2 + r2d(4)) ,

(3.26)

with h = 1 + 1/r3. the m5 is a solitonic solution of 11 dimensional supergravity [14], and
is coupled in a magnetic way to the 4-form

f (4) = da(3) = h h  1

2q|g| d  d1      d3 = 3(4)

and in an electric way to the 7-form

f (7) = f (4) + a(3)  f (4) = h 2h  dx0  . . .  dx5  dr .

(3.27)

(3.28)

the expression (3.28) for the electric coupling to m5 has the same form (3.3) as the
general electric eld strength discussed previously, so we can apply the same procedure.
analogously to the m2 case, we start from a constant 8-form k (8) in d = 13 and contract it
with an arbitrary vector (lets call it v m

1 ) to a 7-from

k (8)(v1) =

(3.30)

19

extra complications arise when we want to describe the m5 propagating in the back-
ground of the antisymmetric gauge elds f (4) and f (7) of eleven dimensional supergravity.
indeed [15] the 3-form eld strength h living on the world volume of the m5 couples to the
above elds giving the following expression for the wesszumino term:

7| = f (7)  1

2h  f (4) .

(3.31)

it is therefore this last expression that has to be embedded in the 13-dimensional space.
we will follow and generalize the discussion in [1], where an analogous treatment of the m5
wesszumino term has been given for the near-horizon case.

being a eld living on the physical world volume of the brane, only dened over .

as for the near-horizon limit, we only need the embedding of the elds f (7) and f (4), h
to nd the embedding of f (4) we can proceed in a way completely similar to the magnetic

part of the d3-brane eld strength: we start from a constant 5-form in 13 dimensions

k (5) = k (8) =

6
5!

1...5dx 1  dx 1...  dx 5,

(3.32)

in order to get a rank 4 eld strength we contract, as we have done for the other cases, k
with a vector eld v2, with components v2 = v m

xm ). such a contraction yields

2 ( 

k (5)(v2) =

6
4!

1...5v 1

2 dx 2  ...  dx 5,

(3.33)

then we reduce the resulting 4 form to the 11 dimensional hypersurface by using the em-
bedding functions (2.8)

k (5)(v2)| = c c 4v 

2

r
x  4

(3.34)

by requiring k (5)(v2)| = f (4), we can solve for the vector eld v2, which turns out to be
(following the same arguments as for d3) v m

free and

2 ), with v

2 , v 

2 = (v 
v 
2 = c 5x 

(3.35)

note that the two vectors v m
2 have constrained components on orthogonal subspaces
(v1 on the indices  and v2 on the indices ), so we can use for the projection the single
vector v m = (v 

1 and v m

1 , v 

2 ).

we then nd, analogously to [1], that the 7-form appearing in the embedded wess

zumino term has the following form

which, restricted to the hypersurface , reduces to the closed form (3.31).

7 = k (8)(v )  1

4 particles in brane-background

we would like to analyse now the behaviour of a probe particle put in a p-brane back-
ground. in particular, we would like to see if the above construction (embedding in a higher
dimensional at space) can shed new light on the dynamics of the system.

we can interpret the particle in a background as a constrained hamiltonian system and
apply to it the standard rules of constrained quantization.
in particular, the constraints
(2.9) selecting the physical hypersurface can be seen to appear in that context as second-
class primary constraints.

recently, however, an approach has been developed by bars [6] for studying hamiltonian
systems embedded in higher dimensional spaces with two times. here the constraints follow
from an sp(2) gauge symmetry internal to the particle system8. they are therefore rst-class
constraints (instead of second class). in that way it was shown that any physical system
that can be written as a gauge xed form of a particular d + 2 dimensional action with
sp(2) gauge symmetry (the action (2) in [6]) has in fact a (maybe hidden) so(d, 2) o shell
symmetry.

having found an embedding of brane backgrounds in a at spacetime with two time
directions, it is natural to wonder if a system given by a particle in brane background could
be written as gauge xed form of the bars action (and has therefore, if this would be the
case, a hidden so(d, 2) invariance).

it turns out that, in general, this is not true: the action for a particle in a brane back-
ground can be written as gauge xed form of the bars action only when the background
metric is conformally at, that is only in the asymptotic regions of the background. the
details of our application of the construction in [6] are given in section (4.2). before doing
this, let us describe how the resolution of the constraints works when using the second-class
constraints approach.

4.1 hypersurface as a set of second class constraints

we should start from a free hamiltonian in the embedding space,

on which we impose the following two constraints

h0 = p m pm = 4p+p + p 2

 + p 2


(4.1)

(4.2)
(4.3)

8it is a local version of the sp(2) global group relating coordinates and conjugate momenta in phase space

1 = x +x  + (x )2 + x f (x ) ,
2 = (x )2  c(x )2 ,

21

to constrict the motion of the particle to the hypersurface (note, + =  1
2 , + = 2).
note that f (x ) should be interpreted as f (a(x )). following the general procedure
of quantising constrained hamiltonian systems, we add these primary constraints to the
hamiltonian

h = h0 + uii .

(4.4)

in order to nd out whether there are any secondary constraints, we calculate the bracket
of the primary constraints with the hamiltonian

the brackets are dened by {x m , pn} = m
constraints:

i = {i, h}  {i, h0} + uj{i, j} ;

(4.5)

n . from this we nd the following two secondary

1 = x 
2 = x p + (c 2)p+ ,

p  (x f )p+ ,

(4.6)

where a prime denotes dierentiation with respect to x . taking the bracket of the new
constraints with the hamiltonian h we nd two equations that allow to x the coecients
ui: there are no tertiary constraints.

these four constraints are all what is called second-class, because there is no subset of
them that has zero bracket with all other constraints. in order to deal with them we make
use of the dirac analysis [16]. let us introduce the so called dirac brackets

where a = (i, i) , a = 1, ..., 4 and c ab is the inverse of the matrix

{f, g}d = {f, g}  {f, a}c ab{b, g} ,

ab = {a, b} ,

(4.7)

(4.8)

which is nonsingular because all constraints are second-class.

with these new brackets we can calculate the equations of motion via hamiltons equa-

tions

(4.9)
applying this to our case we nd some very non-trivial dierential equations for the x m ,
describing the motion of a particle conned to the embedded spacetime

x m = {x m , h0}d ,

pm = {pm , h0}d .

4.2 first-class constraint approach

we refer, for the context discussed here, to the series of papers of bars and collaborators
[6, 7] of the last year.

there, many systems are discussed where the apparent symmetry of the action can be
enlarged to a bigger, non linearly realized, so(d, 2) hidden symmetry with explicit time-
dependent generators. they show that all these (very dierent) actions can be written as one
and the same action in d + 2 dimensions, with (d, 2) signature, where the so(d, 2) is now
linearly realised. in that context, the dierent actions can be seen as following from dierent
gauge choices of an hidden sp(2) gauge symmetry present in the d + 2 dimensional action.
in some sense, the point of view in [6, 7] is that every time that there is an hidden so(d, 2)
o-shell symmetry in an action, this should indicate that there is an underlying two-times
physical spacetime controlling the system. the action considered, is just one of a collection
of actions all related by some sort of duality, and all derivable by the same underlying higher
dimensional theory through a particular gauge choice.

a nice point is that, in particular, the constraints that dene the embedding of the
ads5  s5 in 12 dimensions can be seen as originating from particular choices of the sp(2)
gauge on the 12-dimensional action. this suggests that the same could be extended to our
case, just with more general constraints. we were, therefore, lead to investigate if that
scenario also ts in the non near-horizon case.

let us consider the bars action [6]

(4.15)

(4.16)

and e1 is the worldline einbein.

to this aim, we make use of the embedding (2.8), that is

x m = (a(r), f (r) + a(r)xx, a(r)x, c(r)n) .

(4.17)

by requiring the action (4.14) to be invariant for variations with respect to the functions
ai

j, we get the three constraints: x m xm = 0, x m pm = 0, p m pm = 0.
the constraint x m xm = 0 gives

from (2.7) and (4.18), we can eliminate f (r) and obtain

a(r)f (r) = c 2(r) .

where b is given by (4.19). this action has the form (4.15).

in this way we have seen that, under condition (4.19), the action for a particle in a
brane background has an hidden so(d, 2) symmetry. we have then found that bars action
(4.14) reduces, by appropriate gauge xings, to the action (4.15) not for the general brane-
background metric (2.1) but only when the constraint (4.19) is satised.

this condition is fullled for an ads  s metric with equal radii for the two factors, but
not for a general brane background, with a, b, c given by the usual harmonic functions.
in particular, this is true for the near-horizon limit of d3, but not for m2 and m5.
in
fact, condition (4.19) follows precisely by imposing the metric (2.1) to be conformally at.

our aim in this paper has been to develop a global description of the spacetime geometries of
m-branes and d-branes by isometrically embedding them in at spacetimes with two extra
dimensions and two times, thus extending the ideas of [1]. we have gained a rather clear
global picture of the geometry, giving insight in the structure around coordinate singularities
and in the symmetries. in particular the dierences between p-branes with p even and p odd,
previously pointed out in [12], are clearly apparent. like the familiar embedding of anti-de
sitter spacetime as a quadric, our embeddings are periodic in time. this is consistent with
some suggestions in [2], but one may of course always pass to a covering spacetime.

in the context of supergravity and string theory, p branes are coupled to (p + 2)-form
eld strengths (rr forms). an embedding of the brane thus has to include, besides the
embedding of the geometry, a prescription for the forms in the higher dimensional space.
this is obtained by dening constant (p + 3)-forms in d + 2 dimensions, and contracting
them using a vector v . the form of v is determined by matching the projection on the
surface with the known forms for d3, m2 and m5. unfortunately, the geometric signicance
of the vector eld v , remains unclear. in the case of m2 brane it is not even unique, since the
v  components are arbitrary. a co-dimension 2 surface has a 2-dimensional normal plane.
in the d3 and m5 cases, the vector v does not lie in this 2-plane, except in the near-horizon
limit. specically, the normal 2-plane is spanned by 1 and 2. one may check that v
is not a linear combination of 1 and 2. the bosonic action for probe branes in the
embedded background (3.1) is completely determined after the construction of v .

one motivation for our work was the possibility of using this approach to quantise strings
moving in these backgrounds. this we have not done, but we have indicated how diracs
theory of constrained systems could in principle be used to quantise a point particle. one
point of interest is that this would automatically build in the periodic temporal boundary
conditions of [2] showing at least that the suggestion is mathematically consistent. our
work also makes contact with recent ideas on physics with two times.
in particular we
see diculties in extending the methods of [6] from the vicinity of the throat to the entire
spacetime.

finally it is possible that the methods developed in this paper may be applicable to
scenarios in which one regards the universe as a brane embedded in a higher-dimensional
spacetime.
