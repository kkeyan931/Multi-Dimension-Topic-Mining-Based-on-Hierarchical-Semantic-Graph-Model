abstract

generalized weierstrass formulae for surfaces in four-dimensional space
r4 are used to study (anti)self-dual rigid string congurations. it is shown
that such congurations are given by superminimal immersions into r4.
explicit formulae for generic (anti)instantons are presented. particular
classes of surfaces are also analyzed.

string theory based on the combined nambu-goto-polyakov action has been
intensively studied during the last decade (see e.g. [1,2]). while formulated for
the target space of arbitrary dimensions, it exhibits special interesting properties
in four dimensions. in this case, in particular, one can introduce an additional
topological -term which modies essentially the properties of the strings [3,4].
such a total action is of the form

where

s = sn g + sp + i  i

sn g = 0z [d]
0 z h

sp =

and i is the self-intersection number given by

special classical congurations, called instantons, play an important role in
the string theory governed by the action (1). they are the solutions of the
system [3]

solutions of the system (5) and their properties have been studied by dier-
ent methods in a number of papers [1-10]. but the complete description of
instantons is still missing.

in this letter we use the generalized weierstrass representation (gwr) for
surfaces in r4 to analyze solutions of the system (5). we show that general
instantons of the theory (1) are given by superminimal immersions into r4.
explicit form of generic instantons is presented. we consider also some special
classes of surfaces (developable surfaces, surfaces with at normal bundle) which
are of non-instanton type but are of importance for the string theory too.

the generalized weierstrass representation (gwr) for surfaces in r4 has
been proposed recently in [11,12]. it starts with the two two-dimensional dirac
equations

1z = p1
1z = p1

,
,

2z = p2
2z = p2

,

.

(6)

where z is a complex variable, bar denotes the complex conjugation, , 
( = 1, 2) and p are complex-valued functions. given the potential p(z, z) and
solutions ,  of the system (6), one denes four real-valued functions x 
( = 1, 2, 3, 4) as

x 1 + ix 2 = z
(12dz + 12dz) ,
x 1  ix 2 = z(cid:0)12dz  12dz(cid:1)
x 3 + ix 4 = z(cid:0)12dz + 12dz(cid:1)
x 3  ix 4 = z(cid:0)12dz + 12dz(cid:1)

,

,

,

(7)

where  is a contour in the domain g (z  g). formulae (7) give a conformal
immersion of a surface with local coordinates z, z where z = 1 + i2 into r4.an
advantage of the gwr (7) is that many geometrical objects take a simple and
compact form. namely, the induced metric is given by

ds2 = u1u2 dz dz

(8)

where u = ||2 + ||2 ( = 1, 2), the gaussian curvature k and normal
curvature kn are of the form

k = 

2

u1u2

[log (u1u2)]zz

,

kn =

while the mean curvature vector h is

2

u1u2 (cid:20)log(cid:18) u2

u1(cid:19)(cid:21)zz

(9)

h =

2

u1u2

[re (p21 + p12) , im (p21 + p12) ,

re(cid:0)p12  p12(cid:1) , im(cid:0)p12  p12(cid:1)(cid:3)

.

(10)

using the formulae (6)-(10), for the nambu-goto and the polyakov action one
gets [11,12]

sn g = 0z u1u2 d1 d2
0 z |p|2d1 d2

sp =

,

.

(11)

(12)

then for the self-intersection number (or the total normal curvature, or the rst
chern number c1() ), one gets the following expression

i =

c1 =

i

8 z zg(cid:18)log

(13)

where g denotes the boundary of the domain g. for the tensors t

(15)

now let us consider self-dual and anti-self-dual congurations. they are given
by equation

where c

 are constant tensors.

in the self-dual case, using (15), one gets

 = c
t



a2 = b2

(16)

(17)

where a and b are arbitrary constants. eectively one has, obviously, only one
arbitrary constant.

the constraint (17) is compatible with the system (6) if p = 0. so, in virtue
of (10), the self-dual congurations are given by minimal surfaces in r4. this
result is not new (see e.g. [9]). further, using the gwr (17), one obtains

x zz  x zz =(cid:0)11z  1z1(cid:1)(cid:0)2z2  22z(cid:1)

.

(18)

taking into account the constraint (17), one concludes that

(cid:16)x zz(cid:17)2

= 0

.

(19)

the constraint (19) denes the, so-called, superminimal immersion when at each
point of a surface its curvature ellipse is a circle [13].

so instantons in the theory (1) are given by surfaces superminimally im-

mersed into r4.

similarly, in the anti-self-dual case the expressions (14) give the constraint

c1 = d1

(20)

where c and d are arbitrary constants. again, this constraint implies that p = 0

and (cid:16)x zz(cid:17)2

= 0.

so, both instantons and anti-instantons of the string theory in r4 governed
by the action (1) are given by the formulae (6), (7) with p = 0 and the constraints
(17) or (20), respectively.

superminimal immersions in r4 have attracted essential interest in dieren-
tial geometry (see e.g. [13,14]). an advantage of the gwr in this case is that
it allows to obtain simple explicit formulae for such immersions. namely, for
the self-dual case the formulae (7) imply

and for the anti-self-dual case one has

a(cid:0)x 1 + ix 2(cid:1)z = b 12
(cid:0)x 3 + ix 4(cid:1)z = 12
(cid:0)x 1  ix 2(cid:1)z = 12
c(cid:0)x 3 + ix 4(cid:1)z = d 12

,

,

,
,

(cid:0)x 1 + ix 2(cid:1)z = 12
a(cid:0)x 3 + ix 4(cid:1)z = b 12
c(cid:0)x 1  ix 2(cid:1)z = d 12
(cid:0)x 3 + ix 4(cid:1)z = 12

,

,
.

(21)

(22)

where 1, 2 are arbitrary anti-holomorphic functions and 1, 2 are arbitrary
holomorphic functions.

the relations (21) give

a(cid:0)x 1 + ix 2(cid:1) + b(cid:0)x 3 + ix 4(cid:1) = a (z)
b(cid:0)x 1 + ix 2(cid:1)  a(cid:0)x 3 + ix 4(cid:1) = b (z)

,

(23)

where a (z) and b (z) are arbitrary anti-holomorphic and holomorphic func-
tions, respectively. in the case (22) one gets

d(cid:0)x 1  ix 2(cid:1)  c(cid:0)x 3 + ix 4(cid:1) = c (z)
c(cid:0)x 1  ix 2(cid:1) + d(cid:0)x 3 + ix 4(cid:1) = d (z)

,

(24)

where c (z) and d (z) are arbitrary anti-holomorphic and holomorphic func-
tions.

hence, for instantons

x 1 + ix 2 =

1

|a|2+|b|2 [aa (z) + bb (z)]

,

x 3 + ix 4 =

and for anti-instantons

x 1  ix 2 =
x 3 + ix 4 =

1

|a|2+|b|2 (cid:2)ba (z)  ab (z)(cid:3)
|c|2+|d|2 (cid:2)dc (z) + cd (z)(cid:3)
|c|2+|d|2 [cc (z) + dd (z)]

thus, instantons and anti-instantons are given by explicit formulae (25) and (26)
where a, b, c, d are arbitrary functions and a, b, c, d are arbitrary constants.
particular cases of these formulae corresponding to a = 0 or b = 0, c = 0 or
d = 0 have been found, in fact, in the paper [7] where some concrete examples
have been also presented.

now we will consider some other interesting congurations dierent from

instantons.

the developable surfaces (surfaces for which the gaussian curvature k = 0)
are the simplest of them. they are given by the gwr (7) where ,  ( =
1, 2) obey the system (6) with the additional constraint

(cid:16)|1|2 + |1|2(cid:17)(cid:16)|2|2 + |2|2(cid:17) = |a(z)|2

(27)

where a(z) is an arbitrary holomorphic function.

another class of surfaces, the so-called surfaces with at normal bundle,
correspond to the vanishing normal curvature kn = 0. in virtue of (9), they
are generated by the gwr (6), (7) with the additional constraint

(cid:16)|2|2 + |2|2(cid:17) = |a(z)|2(cid:16)|1|2 + |1|2(cid:17)

(28)

where a(z) is an arbitrary holomorphic function. surfaces with at normal bun-
dle represent themselves an important class of surfaces in r4 (see e.g. [15,16]).
choosing a = 1, dierentiating (28) with respect to z and using (6), one

gets

1z1 + 11z = 2z2 + 22z

.

(29)

this condition is satised, in particular, if there are functions q and eq such that

(30)

1z = q1
1z = q1

,
,

equations (6) and (30) imply

q1z  p1z = 0
eq2z  p2z = 0

,
,

5

.

,

2z = eq2
2z = eq2
p1z  q1z = 0
p2z eq2z = 0

,
.

(31)

equations (31) are of the beltrami type. the theory of such type of equations
is well-developed (see e.g. [17]). so, one has the class of surfaces in r4 with at
normal bundle generated by the gwr formulae (7) where  and  ( = 1, 2)
are dened by equations (31).

where 1(z, z) = 2(z, z) is an arbitrary function. a subclass of such surfaces,
the so-called surfaces with the harmonic gauss map, is associated with the
additional constraints

p = a (|1|2 + |1|2) = b(|2|2 + |2|2)
