abstract

a new attempt is demonstrated that qfts can be uv nite if they are
viewed as the low energy eective theories of a fundamental underlying theory
(complete and well-dened in all respects) according to the modern standard
point of view. this approach is much simpler in principle and in technology
comparing to any known renormalization program. some subtle and dicult
issues can be easily resolved. the importance of the procedure for dening
the ambiguities is fully appreciated in the new approach. some simple but
important nonperturbative examples are discussed to show the power and
plausibility of the new approach.

now, it has become a standard point of view that a fundamental theory (well
dened in every aspect) underlies the present qfts that are in fact low energy (le)
eective theories for the phenomena in le ranges [1]. but as far as the author
knows, we are still lacking a formulation that can yield nite results in a natural
way making use of this point of view. here i would like to present a new approach
directly based on this principle [2].

in this point of view, all the feynman amplitudes (fas) or the various green
functions given by a present qft should correspond to the le limits of certain
subset of the well-dened green functions given by the underlying theory. em-
ploying a generating functional or path integral formalism [3] to assemble these
green functions for each of the subsets, the true formulation should be
{}; {ji}; {})}(cid:27)

z 0({j i};   )  l{} (cid:26)z d(i

{}) exp{is(i
6= z d(i) exp{is(i; {ji})},

(1)

(2)

where {} are the underlying fundamental parameters in the underlying theory and
{j i} are the external sources specifying the le phenomenon. the elementary elds
and the action for the qfts are the le limits of the corresponding ones derived from
the underlying theory that depend on the underlying parameters. the dots with an
overline represents the possible remaining eects of the underlying parameters({}).
the inequality (2) is just the origin of uv ill-denedness, the non-commutativity of
the le limit operation and the summation over the paths. only the convergent
fas are indierent to the order of operations. the present qfts are just ill-dened
le reformulations or reorganizations of these subsets of fas or green functions.

in the following i will sketch a recipe for getting rid of the illdenedness natu-
rally following from the standard point of view with the existence of the underlying
theory that is well dened in every aspect.

first we show that the following important relation holds for 1-loop ill-dened

fas (1-loop divergent feynman graphs)

z dnq(cid:16)pj(cid:17)

f (q, {pj}, {mk}) = (cid:16)pj(cid:17)

0({pj}, {mk}),

(3)

with   1 being the usual supercial divergence degree of r dnqf (q, {pj}, {mk})
so that the lhs of eq.(3) exists (nite), (cid:16)pj(cid:17)
denoting dierentiations wrt the
external parameters {pj}s of the amplitude and 0(...) is the le limit of the ampli-
tude calculated in the underlying theory (i.e., the internal momentum integration is
performed rst).

the proof is very simple, since

dnq(cid:16)pj(cid:17)

l{}

f(q, {pj}, {mk}; {l})

f (q, {pj}, {mk}) = z dnq(cid:16)pj(cid:17)

r
= z dnql{} (cid:16)pj(cid:17) f (q, {pj}, {mk}; {l})
= l{} z dnq(cid:16)pj(cid:17) f(q, {pj}, {mk}; {l})
({pj}, {mk}; {l}) = (cid:16)pj(cid:17)
= l{} (cid:16)pj(cid:17)

0({pj}, {mk}).

(4)

the second and the fth steps follow from the commutativity of the two operations
and l{} as they act on dierent arguments, the third step is due to the
f (q, ...) and the fourth is justied from the existence of

(cid:16)pj(cid:17)
existence of r dnq(cid:16)pj(cid:17)
r dnq f (q, ...; {l})(= (...; {l})).
the right end of eq.(3) can be found now as the left end exists as a nonpolynomial
(nonlocal) function of external momenta and masses. to nd 0({pj}, {mk}), we
integrate both sides of eq.(3) wrt the external momenta  times indenitely to
arrive at the following expressions

(cid:18)zp(cid:19)

h(p)0({pj}, {mk})i = 0({pj}, {mk}) + n ({pj}, {c})

= npl({pj}, {mk}) + n ({pj}, {c})

(5)

with {c} and {c} being arbitrary constant coecients of an   1 order polyno-
mial in external momenta n  and npl being a denite nonpolynomial function of
momenta and masses. evidently 0 is not uniquely obtained within conventional
qfts at this stage, its true expression should contain a denite polynomial part
(n (   ; {c}) with c = c  c) (which is unknown yet and thus blurred by
ambiguities ({c})) implying that it should have come from the le limit operation.
we can take the above procedures as eorts for rectifying the ill-dened fas,

i.e.,

z dnqf (q, {pj}, {mk}) >=< npl({pj}, {mk}) + n ({pj}, {c})

(6)

with >=< indicating that lhs is rectied as rhs [4]. although ambiguous, the rhs
of eq.(6) is the best we can achieve within the present qfts.

as we have addressed, the cs arise in fact from the le limit operation, they
should be uniquely dened for any specic low energy phenomenology up to possible
equivalence. dierent (inequivalent) choices of these constants either are incorrect
or simply lead to irrelevant predictions. since dierent regs and/or ren conditions
just correspond to dierent choices of the constants, we may nd, especially in
nonperturbative cases (such important examples can be found in ref.
[5]), that
they would lead to rather dierent renormalized le theories, or even could not
describe relevant low energy physics. thus, the underlying theory does stipulate or
inuence the eective ones through these constants though the underlying parameters
do not explicitly appear in the le formulations. all the known programs failed to
fully appreciate this important issue. for further discussions, see ref. [2, 6].

now we consider the treatment for the multi-loop case which is very simple and

straightforward.

suppose a multi-loop graph  (we will use the same symbol to denote the graph
and the fa associated with it if it is not confusing) contains at least overall diver-
gence, we proceed like the following (just like in the 1-loop case), (we will use in the
following   1 to denote the overall divergence index [3] for any graph  and {l}
to refer to the internal momenta, all the partial dierentiation operators and their
inverse (denoted by 1
 ) act upon the momenta only external to the very internal
integration of the graph under consideration)

0(   ; {c0

i })  l{} z y dl f({l},    ; {})

 {l{} z y dl f({l},    ; {})}

here we note that the dierentiation wrt the external parameters created a sum
of graphs {} (without overall divergence) from the original graph . any overall
divergence (including overally overlapping ones) is hence killed [7]. each graph in the
set  is a product of disconnected subgraphs (each subgraph itself may contain
overlapping divergences). the le limit operator crossed all the other parts but
stopped before the divergent subgraphs. all the dots in the expressions refer to the

3

parameters (some of them are themselves internal momenta to some (sub)graphs)
external to the loop integrations for the subgraphs. since some loop momenta are
external to other subgraphs, one should not carry out these loop integrations before
the ill-dened subgraphs are treated.

as the ill-dened subgraphs in [] are disconnected with each other, we now
treat each of them separately as a new total graph and go through the procedures
from eq.(7) to eq.(10) again and again till we meet the smallest subgraphs that are
completely convergent. in this course, the le limit operator crosses more and more
parts of the total graph till the nal part, then we get the integrands totally expressed
with propagators and vertices given by the eective theories and we can begin to
perform all the loop integrations backwardly, i.e., from the smallest subgraphs up
to larger graphs till all the internal loop integrations and all the inverse operations
(indenite integration) wrt various external momenta (after the associated internal
integrations) are done, a natural order from our treatment. [it is worthwhile to note
that at each level of the subgraphs, the loop integrations are guaranteed to be
convergent due to weinbergs theorem [8]].

the resulting expression will be a denite nonlocal function plus nonlocal am-
biguities (due to subgraph divergences) and local ambiguities if  is suering from
overall divergences.

here some remarks are in order.
a. it is evident that overlapping divergences are just automatically resolved in

our approach, there is nothing special about it.

b. in our treatment of the ill-dened graphs, since every loop integration actu-
ally performed is convergent, the linear transformations of the internal momenta do
not alter the results of the loop integrations. due to the inverse operator, these lin-
ear transformations of the integration variables will at most change the ambiguous
constants that are yet to be determined. thus these linear transformations merely
lead to reg eects. this observation implies that one should not worry about the
variable shifting and routing of the external momenta that belong to the transfor-
mations just described. for further physical implications of this property see ref.
[6].

here i would like to cite a recent work that fully exhibits the diculties with the
old reg and ren schemes, the work by phillips et al [5] where it is demonstrated that
in the nonperturbative contexts the cuto scheme and the dimensional regularization
(dr) scheme are inequivalent to each other. this is due to that dierent reg
schemes yield dierent degrees of divergences which in turn deform the theory quite
dierently (inequivalent choices of the constants). more irremovable divergences in
a reg scheme means less rationality in using it, and hence the cuto scheme has no
better chance than the dr scheme to yield reasonable conclusions.

reexamining the problem within our approach one would revive the eective
eld theory approach to the le nuclear physics initiated by weinberg [9] from the
recent criticism [10](for more details and discussions, see [6]).

as a matter of fact the qm hamiltonian with singular potentials (like the

4

delta-potentials) needs self-adjoint extension and an additional parameterthe fam-
ily parameternecessarily appears which upon dierent choices leads to dierent
or inequivalent (le) physics [11], just supporting our point of view. thus, such
nonperturbative problems can be critical touchstones for these schemes.

for the ir problem please refer to ref. [6] where a new possibility of treatment
is suggested basing on a similar idea that the present qfts go wrong in the ir ends
of the spectra.

in summary, we discussed briey the approach recently proposed by the author
and the important consequences following from it. we have overcome many typical
diculties and shortcomings associated with old reg and ren frameworks. the
method is simple and powerful in many respects.
