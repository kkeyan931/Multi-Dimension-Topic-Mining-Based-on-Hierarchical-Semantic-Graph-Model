abstract

the multidimensional n = 4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics (susy
qm) is constructed using the supereld approach. as a result the component
form of the classical and quantum lagrangian and hamiltonian is obtained.
in the considered susy qm both classical and quantum n = 4 algebras
include central charges and it opens various possibilities for the partial super-
symmetry breaking. it is shown, that the quantum mechanical models with
one quarter, one half and three quarters of the unbroken(broken) supersym-
metries can exist in the framework of the multidimensional n = 4 susy qm,
while the one-dimensional n = 4 susy qm, constructed earlier, admits only
the one half or total supersymmetry breakdown. we illustrate the constructed
general formalism, as well as all possible cases of the partial susy breaking
on the example, which is the direct multidimensional generalization of the
one-dimensional n = 4 superconformal quantum mechanical model. some
open questions and possible applications of the constructed multidimensional
n = 4 susy qm to the known exactly integrable systems and to the prob-
lems of quantum cosmology are briey discussed.

i. introduction

the supersymmetric quantum mechanics (susy qm), being introduced rst in refs.
[1]  [2] for the n = 2 case turns out to be a convenient tool for investigating problems of
the supersymmetric eld theories, since it provides the simple and at the same time quite
adequate understanding of various phenomena, arising in the relativistic theories.

the important question of all modern theories of fundamental interactions, including su-
perstrings and m  theory is the problem of the spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry.
supersymmetry, as a fundamental symmetry of the nature, if exists, has to be spontaneously
broken at low energies, since particles with all equal quantum numbers, except the spin, are
not observed experimentally. the several (rather dierent) mechanisms of the spontaneous
breakdown of supersymmetry have been proposed in particle physics in order to resolve this
problem. one of them is to add to the supersymmetric lagrangian the so called d , or f 
terms, which are invariant under supersymmetry transformations as well but break the su-
persymmetry spontaneously due to the nonzero vacuum expectation values or, alternatively,
to introduce into the theory some soft breaking mass terms by hand; the latter procedure
does not spoil the nonrenormalization theorem of the supersymmetric eld theories and was
successfully applied for constructing the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard
model (see ref. [3] and refs. therein). the next mechanism of susy breaking is the dy-
namical (nonperturbative) breakdown of the supersymmetry, caused by instantons (see, for
example, [4] and refs. therein). in this case the energy of tunneling between topologically
distinct vacua produces the energy shift from the zero level, hence leading to the sponta-
neous breakdown of supersymmetry. and, nally, the mechanism of the partial spontaneous
breaking of the n = 2 supersymmetry in the eld theory was proposed recently in ref.
[5]. this mechanism is based on the including into the lagrangian two types of the fayet 
iliopoulos terms  electric and magnetic ones and it leads to the corresponding modication
of the n = 2 susy algebra of ref. [6].

the problem of the spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry could be investigated in
the framework of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics as well. the conjecture, that
supersymmetry can be spontaneously broken by instantons [1]  [2] was investigated in
details by several authors for the case of n = 2 susy qm [7]  [9]. however the most
physically interesting case is provided by the n = 4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics,
since it can be applied to the description of the systems, resulted from the realistic n = 1
supersymmetric eld theories (including supergravity) in four (d = 4) dimensions after the
dimensional reduction to one dimension.

one-dimensional n = 4 susy qm was constructed rst in refs. [10]  [11]. the
partial breaking of supersymmetry, caused by the presence of the central charges in the
corresponding superalgebra was also discussed in ref. [11].
it was the rst example of
the partial breaking of supersymmetry in framework of susy qm and the corresponding
mechanism is in full analogy to that in ref. [5] in the eld theory. the main point is that
the presence of the central charges in the superalgebra allows the partial supersymmetry
breakdown, whereas according to wittens theorem [1], no partial supersymmetry breakdown
is possible if the susy algebra includes no central charges. the main goal of our paper is
further generalization of the construction, proposed in ref. [11] for the multidimensional
case and investigation of partial breaking of supersymmetry under the consideration.

2

the question of the particular importance is to consider the supersymmetric algebra with
the central charges for the several reasons. first, it provides a good tool to study the dyon
solutions of quantum eld theory since in such theories the mass and electric and magnetic
charges turns out to be the central charges [12]. second, the presence of the central charges
produces the reach structure of supersymmetry breaking. namely it is possible to break a
part of all supersymmetries, leaving all others exact [13]. in fact, the invariance of a state
with respect to the supersymmetry transformation means the saturation of the bogomolny
bound and this situation takes place in n = 2 and n = 4 supersymmetric yang  mills
theory [14]  [15] as well as in theories of an extended supergravity [16].

the investigation of supersymmetric properties of branes in m  theory also revealed
that the partial breakdown of supersymmetry takes place. namely the ordinary branes break
half of the supersymmetries, while intersecting and rotating branes can leave only 1/4,
1/8, 1/16 or 1/32 of the supersymmetries unbroken [17]. the known examples of the break-
down of the supersymmetries in supersymmetric quantum mechanics are the cases, where
either all the supersymmetries are broken(exact) or only half of all the supersymmetries are
broken(exact) [11]. in this paper we demonstrate the possibility of the three  quarters or
one  quarter of the supersymmetry breakdown in the framework of multidimensional n = 4
susy qm. the later case (3/4 of the supersymmetries are exact) has not been observed
before neither in supersymmetric eld theories nor in susy qm and seems to be quite
interesting by itself even without specifying the physical origin of the phenomena.

the paper is organized as follows. in sec. ii we present a formal construction of n = 4
multidimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics: classical and quantum hamiltonian
and lagrangian, susy transformations, supercharges algebra and so on. in sec. iii partial
supersymmetry breaking is investigated and all possible cases of the partial susy break-
down are listed.
iv we give an exactly solvable example, which illustrates main
properties of the introduced formal constructions. this example is interesting by itself since
we consider the multidimensional generalization of the n = 4 superconformal quantum me-
chanics [11], [18], which is naturally related to the extremal rn black holes in near horizon
limit and ads/cft correspondance [19]. in sec. v we conclude with some open questions
and further perspectives.

in sec.

ii. d  dimensional n = 4 susy quantum mechanics

in this section we describe the general formalism of d  dimensional (d  1) n = 4
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, starting with the supereld approach and concluding
with the component form of the desired lagrangian and hamiltonian.

consider n = 4 susy transformations

(2.1)

in the superspace, spanned by the even coordinate t and mutually complex conjugated odd
coordinates a and a. the parameters of n = 4 susy transformations a and a are

the

following

{qa, qb} = b

ah,

[h, qa] = [h, qa] = 0.

(2.3)

the automorphism group for a given algebra is so(4) = su(2)  su(2) and the generators
of the n = 4 susy transformations are in the spinor representation of one of the su(2)
groups.

the next step is to construct irreducible representations of the algebra (2.3). the usual

way of doing this is to use the supercovariant derivatives

da =

(2.4)

and impose some constraints on the general supereld. hereafter we deal with the supereld
i (i = 1, ..., d), subjected to the following constraints:

[da, da]i = 4mi,
dadai = 2ni,
da dai = 2ni,

(2.5)

where mi are real constants, while ni and ni are mutually complex conjugated constants.
the explicit form of the supereld i is the following:

(   t). note, that in the case when all the constants mi, ni, ni are equal to zero, the
supereld (2.6) represents d trivial copies of the supereld , given in ref. [20], which
describes the irreducible representation of one-dimensional n = 4 susy qm. the latter
supereld contains one bosonic eld , four fermionic elds a and a and three auxiliary
bosonic elds bb

a (i = 1, 2, 3) are ordinary pauli matrices.

abi, where (i )b

a = (i)b

another irreducible representation of the algebra (2.3) can be constructed after making

the appropriate generalization of the constraints given in ref. [10]:

1our conventions for spinors are as follows: a = bba, a = abb, a = bba, a = ab b, a =
(a), a = (a), ()  aa = 212, ( )  a a = (), 12 = 1, 12 = 1.

(acdc db + bcdc da) = 0.

(2.7)

the technique of constructing n = 4 susy invariant lagrangians is absolutely the same
for both cases and therefore we shall not consider the second one separately.

the components of the supereld (2.6) transform under the n = 4 transformations as

follows:

i = a i

ai = bbai

(2.8)

now one can write down the most general form of the lagrangian, invariant under the

above-mentioned n = 4 susy transformations:

l = 8(z d2d2 (a(i)) +

a
bibbi

a ),

(2.9)

where a(i) is an arbitrary function of the supereld i, called the superpotential. the
second term is the fayet  iliopoulos term and a
i are just constants. the
expression for the lagrangian (2.9) is the most general one in the sense, that any other
n = 4 susy invariant terms added will lead with necessity to the higher derivatives in the
component form.

bi = (i )b

ai

after the integration with respect to the grassmanian coordinates a and a one obtains

the component form of the lagrangian (2.9):

l = k  v,

where di is a standard covariant derivative, dened with the help of the introduced christof-

for the conserving supercharges, corresponding to the susy transformations (2.8), leaving
the invariance of the lagrangian:

(2.21)

(2.22)

these formulae for the conserved supercharges complete the classical description of the
desired n = 4 susy multidimensional mechanics and now to quantize it we should analyze
its constraints.

following the standard procedure of quantization of the system with bosonic and

fermionic degrees of freedom [21], we introduce the canonical poisson brackets:

{i, pj} = i
j,

{ai, p(),bj} = a

b i
j,

{ i

a, pb

( ),j} = a

b i
j,

(2.23)

where pi, p(),ai, and pa
form of the momenta:

( ),i are the momenta, conjugated to i, ai and i

a. from the explicit

pi = gij

i,

p(),ai = igij

j
a,

pa
( ),i = igijaj,

(2.24)

(2.25)

with the metric gij given by (2.16), one can conclude , that the system possesses the second
 class fermionic constraints:

(),ai = p(),ai + igij j
a,

since

and a

( ),i = pa

( ),i + igijaj,

{a

( ),i, (),bj} = 2igija
b .

(2.26)

(2.27)

therefore, the quantization has to be done using the dirac brackets, dened for any two
functions va and vb as

{va, vb}dirac = {va, vb}  {va, c}

1

{c, d}

{d, vb}.

(2.28)

as a result we obtain the following dirac brackets for the canonical variables:

{i, pj}dirac = i

(2.32)

note the appearance of the central charges in the algebra. this fact is extremely important
especially for the investigation of partial supersymmetry breaking, given in the next section.

replacing the dirac brackets by (anti)commutators using the rule

one obtains the quantum algebra:

and i in (2.39) is the corresponding spin connection. therefore, the quantum super-
charges (2.35)  (2.36) are mutually hermitean conjugated and the resulting quantum hamil-
tonian hquant. is a hermitean self  adjoint operator as well.

as a result, the equations (2.34)  (2.40) completely describe the general formalism of
n = 4 susy d  dimensional quantum mechanics and this provides the basis for the anal-
ysis of its main properties.

iii. partial susy breaking

let us investigate in details the question of the partial supersymmetry breakdown in the
framework of the constructed n = 4 susy qm in an arbitrary d number of dimensions.
as it was mentioned in the introduction, the problem of partially broken supersymmetry is
very important for applications in supergravity, superstring theories and in m  theory as
well, and supersymmetric quantum mechanics turns out to be an adequate mighty tool for
investigating of the corresponding problems in supersymmetric eld theories.

9

we shall see that in contrast to the one-dimensional n = 4 susy qm, the multidimen-
sional one provides also the possibilities when either only one quarter of all supersymmetries
is exact (for d  2), or one quarter of all supersymmetries is broken (for d  3).

in order to study partial susy breaking it is convenient to introduce a new set of real

 valued supercharges:

sa = qa + qa,

t a = i(qa  qa).

(3.1)

(3.2)

in the equations above the su(2) covariance is obviously damaged. this is the price we pay
for passing to the realvalued supercharges. however, for the further discussion the loss of
the covariance does not cause any problems. the label a has to be considered now just
as the number of the supercharges, denoted as s and t .

the new supercharges form the following n = 4 superalgebra with the central charges:

{sa, sb} = h(a
{t a, t b} = h(a
{sa, t b} = i(a

b + b
b + b
bi  b

bi + b
bi + b

a) + (a
a) + (a
ai)mi + i(abini + ab

ai)mi + (abini  ab
ai)mi  (abini  ab

i ni),
i ni),

i ni).

(3.3)
(3.4)
(3.5)

the algebra (3.3)  (3.5) is still nondiagonal. however, some particular choices of the
constant parameters mi, ni and b
ai bring the algebra to the standard form, i.e., to the form
when the right hand side of (3.5) vanishes and the right hand sides of (3.3) and (3.4) are
diagonal with respect to the indexes a and b.

now we consider several cases separately.

a. four supersymmetries exact / four supersymmetries broken

if we put equal to zero all central charges, appearing in the algebra, then no partial
breakdown of supersymmetry is possible. in this case all supersymmetries are exact, if the
energy of the ground state is zero; otherwise all of them are broken. this statement is
obviously independent of the number of dimensions d.

b. two supersymmetries exact

the case of the partial supersymmetry breakdown, when the half of the supersymmetries
are exact, have been considered earlier [11] in the framework of one-dimensional n = 4 susy
qm, but we shall describe it for completeness as well. consider one-dimensional (d = 1)
n = 4 susy qm and put all constants entered to the right hand sides of (3.3)  (3.5) equal
to zero, except

m1

and 3
1.

(3.6)

then the algebra (3.3) - (3.5) takes the form

10

{s1, s1} = 2h + 2m13
1,
{s2, s2} = 2h  2m13
1,
{t 1, t 1} = 2h + 2m13
1,
{t 2, t 2} = 2h  2m13
1.

(3.7)

it means that if the energy of the ground state is equal to m13
1 and the last-mentioned
product is positive, then s2 and t 2 supersymmetries are exact, while the other two are
1 is negative, then s1 and t 1 supersymmetries are exact, provided the
broken.
energy of the ground state is equal to  m13
1.

if m13

c. one supersymmetry exact

the case of the three  quarters breakdown of supersymmetry is possible if the dimension
of n = 4 susy qm is at least two (d  2). indeed, let us keep for d = 2 the following set
of parameters nonvanished:

3

1, 1

2, m1

and re(n2)  n 2.

(3.8)

then one obtains

further choice

{s1, s1} = 2h + 2m13
{s2, s2} = 2h  2m13
{t 1, t 1} = 2h + 2m13
{t 2, t 2} = 2h  2m13

(3.9)

(3.10)

leads to the case, when only t 2 supersymmetry is exact, while all others are broken if the
1 is negative, then t 1
1 > 0. if m13

then t 2 supersymmetry is broken, while all others are exact under the condition, that the

1. if the last-mentioned product is positive, then
t 2 supersymmetry is exact, while all others are broken, provided that the energy of the
ground state is 3m13
1 and we arrive to the three-dimensional generalization of the case c.
obviously, when considering three-dimensional n = 4 susy qm one can either keep
the parameters (3.8) under the condition (3.10), or the parameters (3.6), or put all of
them equal to zero, and therefore obtain all particular cases of spontaneous breakdown of
supersymmetry, discussed earlier. it is also obvious, that all this cases can be obtained from
higher dimensional (d  3) n = 4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

to summarize this section one should note, that according to the given general analysis
of partial susy breaking in n = 4 multidimensional susy qm, there exist possibilities to
construct the models with 1
4 supersymmetries unbroken, as well as models with
totally broken or totally unbroken supersymmetries. however, the answer on the question
which one of these possibilities can be realized for the considered system, depends crucially
on the form of the chosen superpotential and on the imposed boundary conditions of the
quantum mechanical problem.

iv. explicit example

for the better illustration of the ideas of the previous section it is useful to consider a
particular choice of the superpotential a(i). as it was mentioned before for considering all
possible cases of the partial supersymmetry breakdown the minimal amount of the superelds
needed is three. therefore let us take three superelds of the type (2.6) and choose the
constants mi, ni, ni and a

bi in accordance with the expressions (3.6), (3.8) and (3.11).

the simple and at the same time interesting example is the case, when the superpotential
is the direct sum of terms, each being a function of only one supereld. this gives the
possibility of the considerable simplication of the classical and quantum hamiltonians and
the supercharges as well [11]. we choose the explicit form of the superpotential as

a(i) = ilni,

i = 1, 2, 3

(4.1)

12

and consider the physical bosonic components of the superelds i as the functions of the
new variables xi, namely:

making the following redenition of the fermionic variables

i = (xi)2.

ai = aivuut2

2a
(i)2 ,

i
a = i

avuut2

2a
(i)2 ,

(4.2)

(4.3)

where no summation over the repeated indices is assumed, one obtains the canonical com-
mutation relations between fermions

{ai, j

b } = a

b ij.

(4.4)

inserting the expressions (4.1), (4.2) and (4.3) into (2.37), one obtains three-dimensional
superconformal n = 4 quantum mechanics [18] with

hquant. = h 1 + h 2 + h 3,

(4.5)

i.e., as it could be concluded from the fact that the superpotential is diagonal with respect to
the superelds considered, the total hamiltonian is also the direct sum of three hamiltonians,
each of them containing the bosonic and fermionic operators of only one type. the explicit
form of the hamiltonians h i, (i = 1, 2, 3.) is

(4.8)

the next step is to nd the energy spectrum of the quantum hamiltonian (4.5).

since the bosonic and fermionic variables of each type are completely separated, the
eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian (4.5) is the direct product of the eigenfunctions of the
hamiltonians (4.6) - (4.8) and the total energy is just a sum of the energies, corresponding
to the hamiltonians h i.

13

let us nd the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian h 1. consider the general state in
the reduced fock space, spanned by the fermionic creation and annihilation operators 1
and a1, obeying the anticommutation relations (4.4) with i = 1:

a

|i = x1(x1)|0i + y a

a|0i + z1(x1) 1

have been investigated in details for the nonsupersymmetric theory in refs. [22]  [23] and
in the framework of n = 2 supersymmetric quantum mechanics in refs. [23]  [26] as well.
the most detailed and complete study has been done by das and pernice [23], where the
eigenfunctions and the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian of the type (4.14) where found
after appropriate regularization of the potential and superpotential, depending on either
one considers nonsupersymmetric or n = 2 supersymmetric problem. however, as it can
be seen from (4.1) and (4.2) the superpotential in our n = 4 case for the hamiltonian with
1
x2 term in the potential energy is regular in contrast to the case of n = 2 supersymmetric
quantum mechanics and therefore we use the results of paper [23], which are obtained after
the regularization of the potential, but not of the superpotental.

for the problem considered one obtains (we take the value of the parameter 3

1 without

loss of generality to be equal +1).

if we also choose 1

absolutely the same as in (4.15)  (4.18). the only dierence is, that the parameter m1
should be replaced by n 2 or m 3 respectively. however, the eigenfunctions, corresponding
to e2
iv are the linear combinations of the states of zero and two fermionic sectors,
since the fermionic number operator 2
aa2 does not commute with the hamiltonian h 2. the
energies e2
iii are also the linear combinations of the both states of one fermionic
sector, because the matrix (1)b
a is not diagonal. the analogous situation takes place for the
hamiltonian h 3.

ii and e2

now we are in a position to describe partial supersymmetry breaking following the lines

of the previous section.

first, let us consider the one dimensional case, with m1 equal to zero. as it was mentioned
above, zero value of m1 is the branching point and therefore the energy spectra (4.16) and

15

(4.17), as well as the wavefunctions in these regions completely coincide. therefore, one has
the couple of supersymmetric ground states 1

iii and all supersymmetries are exact.

as it was mentioned in the previous section, in order to describe the halfbreaking of
supersymmetry it is enough to consider only the spectrum of the hamiltonian h 1. inserting
the corresponding eigenvalues of the operator h 1 for each range of the parameter m1 into
equations (3.7), one obtains that half of supersymmetries are always broken.

considering the spectra of the hamiltonians h 1 and h 2 one can obtain the three 
quarter breakdown of supersymmetry. indeed, from the equations (3.9), (3.10) and (4.15) 
(4.18) one can conclude, that either t 1 or t 2 supersymmetries are exact, depending on the
range of parameter m1. the corresponding ground state wavefunctions obviously are

(4.19)

(4.20)

(4.21)

(4.22)

in order to study the possibility of the one-quarter breakdown of supersymmetry one
has to consider the three-dimensional case, i.e., the spectra and the wavefunctions of the
hamiltonians h 1, h 2 and h 3. using the equations (3.12), (3.13)  (3.15) and (4.15)  (4.18)
one can conclude, that for the considered model the one-quarter supersymmetry breakdown
is impossible, since the energy of the ground state equals to 3m1, rather than to m1, as
it is required for the annihilation of the ground state by the operators s1, s2 and t 1.
this obviously does not mean that one-quarter supersymmetry breakdown is impossible in
principle, it means instead that this eect is impossible for the simple model we considered.
indeed, let us consider the same three-dimensional problem, but restricting ourselves

now with the nonnegative values of coordinates, i.e., x1  0, x2  0 and x3  0.

the spectrum of h (4.14) when x belongs to the nonnegative half-axis is slightly dier-
ent [22]2 and it opens the possibility to construct the ground state, invariant under three
unbroken supersymmetries. according to ref. [22] we have

e()

k

= 2k   + 1,

(4.23)

where  is given by

2 in fact, as it was recently shown by a. das and s. pernice [23], the energy spectrum, obtained
in [22] is correct, if one considers the problem only on the half-axis.

16

 = +

1
2q1 + 8g,

(4.24)

and k is the nonnegative integer. if   1 then the energies e()
must be excluded from
the spectrum since the corresponding wavefunctions are no longer normalizable. otherwise
one has to consider both sets of solutions. applying these results to the problem under
consideration, and putting again 3

3 = 1 one obtains for h 1:

1 = 1

2 = 2

k

1
i = |4m1 + 1|,
1
ii = |4m1|,
1
iii = |4m1|,
iv = |4m1  1|.

and therefore the energy spectra have the form

i

4e1,()
4e1,()
4e1,()
4e1,()

= 2k1
ii = 2k1
iii = 2k1
iv = 2k1

i  |4m1 + 1| + 1,
ii  |4m1|,
iii  |4m1| + 2,
iv  |4m1  1| + 1,

(4.25)

(4.26)

and the same expressions for the spectra of h 2 and h 3, with m1 substituted by n 2 and m 3
respectively. the both signs before the second terms has to be taken for ei , if  1
4  m1 < 0 ;
for eii and for eiii, if 0  m1 < 1
2 . let us further restrict the value
of the parameter to belong to the open interval  1
4 < m1 < 0. then due to the equations
(3.13)  (3.15) and (4.26) the minimal energy of the system with k1

4 ; for eiv , if 1

4  m1 < 1

iii = 0 is:

i = k2

i = k3

emin. = e1,

i + e2,

i + e3,

iii = m1,

(4.27)

and according to (3.12) we have the supersymmetric ground state with three supersymme-
tries being unbroken.

in this section we have considered quite schematically the one-, two- and three-
dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric versions of the quantum oscillator with an additional
1
x2 term in the potential energy. however we believe, that even this simple analysis gives a
good illustration of all possible cases of the partial supersymmetry breakdown in multidi-
mensional n = 4 susy qm. one should also stress the crucial meaning of the boundary
conditions in the question of the partial supersymmetry breakdown, as it was shown for the
case of the one-quarter supersymmetry breakdown in the considered example.

v. discussion

in this paper we have described the general formalism of multidimensional n = 4 super-
symmetric quantum mechanics and studied the various possibilities of partial supersymmetry
breaking, illustrating them by the exactly solvable example.

however, the several questions, which seem to be of a particular importance are left still
opened. indeed, it would be interesting to investigate other possibilities of changes of the

17

bosonic end fermionic variables, namely for the cases, when in contrast with (4.1) and (4.2),
the superpotential a(i) is not a direct sum of the terms, each containing only one supereld
i and when the bosonic components of these superelds depend on several variables xi.
the detailed study of this problem can lead to the possible n = 4 supersymmetrization and
quantization of various pure bosonic integrable systems, such as n -particle calogero and
calogero  moser models, which are related to the rn black hole quantum mechanics and to
d = 2 sym theory [27]. this approach also can answer the question about the general class
of the potentials, which lead to the superconformal n = 4 theories in higher dimensions.

another topic which has been left uncovered in this paper is the possible application of
the constructed multidimensional n = 4 susy qm to the problems of quantum cosmology.
the possible embedding of pure bosonic eective lagrangians, derived from the homogeneous
cosmological models to the n = 4 susy qm can shed a new light on the old problems of
boundary conditions and spontaneous susy breaking in quantum cosmology, which were
investigated recently in the framework of n = 2 supersymmetric sigma  model approach
[28]  [29].

all these questions are under intensive study now and will be reported elsewhere.
