abstract

we study the low-energy eective theory of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills
theory with ade gauge groups in view of the spectral curves of the periodic toda
lattice and the a-d-e singularity theory. we examine the exact solutions by using
the picard-fuchs equations for the period integrals of the seiberg-witten dieren-
tial. in particular, we nd that the superconformal xed point in the strong cou-
pling region of the coulomb branch is characterized by the ade superpotential.
we compute the scaling exponents, which agree with the previous results.

1 introduction

seiberg and witten showed that the low-energy eective theory of n = 2 supersymmetric

gauge theory in four dimensions is determined by the prepotential, a holomorhic function

of the period integrals of the meromorphic one-form (the seiberg-witten dierential) on

a riemann surface[1]. for a simple lie group g, it has been proposed in [2, 3] that the

spectral curve of the periodic toda lattice associated with the dual ane lie algebra (bg)

provides the riemann surface which describes the coulomb branch of n = 2 supersym-

metric yang-mills theory with the gauge group g. in the case of gauge theories with some

matter hypermultiplets, the spectral curves and related integrable systems are discussed

in [4]. other systematic approaches based on the heterotic/type ii duality[5] or the m5

branes [6] are also studied extensively.

in the preset work we will study the exact solution of the low-energy eective theory

from the viewpoint of the spectral curve of the periodic toda lattice. for ade type

gauge groups, the spectral curves are shown to be the sum of the superpotential of two-

dimensional topological landau-ginzburg models of ade type and that of the topological
cp 1 model. in a series of papers[7, 8, 9, 10], we have studied various aspects of the exact

solution of the seiberg-witten theories with ade gauge groups by using two-dimensional

topological eld theories.

this paper is organized as follows: in sect. 2, we introduce the spectral curve of the

periodic toda lattice associated with the dual of the ane lie algebra (bg) for the gauge

theory with gauge group g. in sect. 3, we consider the ade gauge groups and express
the spectral curve as the sum of the superpotential of the topological cp 1 model and

the ade minimal model. using the at coordinates in the a-d-e singularity theory,

we derive the picard-fuchs dierential equations obeyed by the period integral of the

seiberg-witten dierential. we then show that these equations are equivalent to the
gauss-manin system for the ade minimal model and the cp 1 model and the scaling

relation for the seiberg-witten dierential. in sect, 4, we study an exact solution in the

strong coupling region. argyres and douglas[11] showed that there exists a non-trivial

rg xed point in the coulomb branch such that the massless solitons with mutually non-

local charges coexist and the theory corresponds to n = 2 superconformal eld theory,

1

where the gauge invariant order parameters have fractional dimensions with respect to

the bps mass. we investigate this argyres-douglas point in the coulomb branch of the

n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory for ade gauge groups.

2 spectral curves and a-d-e singularity

the low-energy properties of the coulomb branch of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories

with gauge group g are exactly described by holomorphic data associated with certain

algebraic curves. in particular, the bps mass formula is expressed in terms of the period

integrals of the so-called seiberg-witten (sw) dierential sw :

roots of the lie algebra and 0 = , where  denotes the highest root. we consider
a representation r with d dimensions. let e be generators associated with the roots

of the casimirs. the exponents ei of g is related to qi by qi = ei + 1. the second order

casimir u2 has degree 2 and the top casimir ur has degree qr = h, where h is the coxeter

for simply-laced lie algebra g, bg is self-dual, i.e. (g(1)) = g(1). for non-simply laced
lie algebras, we have cbr

need the twisted ane lie algebra to construct the spectral curve. the characteristic

due to h 6= h, the spectral parameter z or its dual 2/z appears in the spectral curve in a
nontrivial way. now we will write the explicit form of the spectral curves for d-dimensional

representation d of non-simply laced lie algebra g.

ar (x) and

we6(x1, x2, x3) = x4

(20)

it is, however, found in [13] that w 27

e6 is a single-variable version of the lg superpotential
for the e6 minimal model. on the other hand, the singularity of the form of (20) is ob-

tained by considering the bration of ale spaces[5]. the relation of these two description

of the seiberg-witten curves are discussed in [12].

for non-simply laced cases, we have rather nontrivial wg(x) from the spectral curves

although in the two dimensional case, the lg superpotentials are obtained from the simply

laced one by the folding procedure[14]. the functions w r

note that for cr and g2 cases, the superpotentials w r

two-dimensional topological lg theory.

3 picard-fuchs equations and 2d topological landau-

ginzburg models

in this section we consider the ade gauge groups. to describe the moduli space of the
coulomb branch we adopt the at coordinate system (t1, t2,   , tr) developed in the a-
d-e singularity theory instead of the conventional casimir coordinates (u1, u2,   , ur).
the coordinate transformation is read o from the residue integral

ti = cii dxw r

g (x, u)

ei
h ,

i = 1,   , r

(29)

with a suitable constant ci [13, 15]. notice that the overall degree of w r

g is equal to h.

the at coordinates ti are expressed as polynomials in ui.

firstly we discuss the role of at coordinates in the two-dimensional topological

landau-ginzburg models. we dene the primary elds i(x, t) as the derivatives of the

superpotential wg(x, t):

i(x, t) =

wg(x, t)

ti

.

(30)

we choose the normalization factor cr such that r(x, t) = 1. we now consider two-

dimensional topological gravity coupled to topological lg model[16]. in this case, the

primary eld r is regarded as the puncture operator p . in the at coordinate system,
the topological metric ij = hijpi is independent of ti and takes the form:

ij = ei+ej,h.

(31)

furthermore, the primary elds obey the operator product expansions

i(x, t) j(x, t) =

rxk=1

cij

k(t) k(x, t) + qij(x, t) xwg(x, t).

(32)

the atness condition implies that the function qij(x, t) in (32) satises

2wg(x, t)

titj

= x qij(x, t).

(33)

the structure constants c k
the relation fijk(t) = klc l

ij(t) are related to the three-point function fijk(t) = hijki by
ij(t). in two-dimensional topological theory, all the topological
correlation functions are determined by the free energy f (t). the three point function
fijk(t) is given by 3f (t)/titjtk.

8

the associativity of the chiral ring (ij)k = i(jk) implies the relation c l
il. let us introduce r  r matrices ci, fi and  by (ci)k

lk =
ij, (fi)jk = fijk and

j = c k

ijc n

c l

jkc n

 = (ij). the associativity condition leads to the commutativity of the matrices ci;

cicj = cjci.

(34)

using fi = ci, we obtain the witten-dijkgraaf-verlinde-verlinde (wdvv) equation:

fi1fj = fj1fi,

(35)

which is one of the important relations in two-dimensional topological theory.

now we go back to the four-dimensional gauge theory. we consider the period integral

of the sw dierential sw (28):

 =z

sw

(36)

along the certain one-cycle  on the spectral curve (16). in terms of the superpotential

wg(x, t), the sw dierential takes the form:

it is shown in [7] that  obeys the set of dierential equations:

sw =

titj  =

qwg(x, t)2  42
rxk=1

ij(t)tk tr ,

c k

(37)

(38)

which is called as the gauss-manin system in the singularity theory.

in addition to the gauss-manin system, the sw dierential satises another two

dierential equations. from the scaling relation to the superpotential

  rxi=1

qititi + xx! wg(x, t) = hwg(x, t),

we obtain the scaling relation for the period :

  rxi=1

qititi + h  1!  = 0.

(39)

(40)

the nal dierential equation is obtained by regarding the l.h.s. of the spectral curve
(16) as the superpotential of the topological cp 1 model [18]:

wcp 1(z) = z +

2
z  tr.

9

(41)

since log 2 and tr are at coordinates of the cp 1 model, we obtain the cp 1 relation:

(cid:16)()2  422

tr(cid:17)  = 0.

(42)

(44)

(45)

combining the scaling relation (40) and the cp 1 relation (42), we obtain the dierential

equation

 = 0

(43)

by solving the gauss-manin system (38) and the scaling equation (43), we may analyze

the exact solutions in the coulomb branch. for classical gauge groups, the present picard-

fuchs equations are shown to be the same as those appeared in the previous works[19],

in which various gauge theories with or without hypermultiplets are discussed.

in the weak coupling region where the scale parameter 2h = 42 are small, the solu-

tions of these picard-fuchs equations are studied extensively using various methods[19,

20], which are shown to agree with the microscopic instanton calculation [21]. in the next

section, we study the solutions in the strong coupling region. but before going to the next

section, we discuss an important consequence of the gauss-manin system. since the dual

period adi also satises the gauss-manin system (38), this gauss-manin system provides
the third-order dierential equation for the prepotential f (a):

where

efijk =

rxl=1

cij

l eflrk,

efijk = tiaitj aj tk akfijk,
fijk = ai aj akf (a)
the equations (44) is very similar to fijk(t) = c l

ijkl in two-dimensional topological

theory. let us introduce matrices efi, g and fi dened by (efi)jk = efijk, g = efr, and
(fi)jk = fijk, respectively. then we nd the wdvv equations in the seiberg-witten
theory[22, 9]:

which may be written in the form

efig 1 efj = efjg 1 efi,
k fj = fjf 1
fif 1
k fi.

10

(46)

(47)

in addition to the wdvv equation, the prepotential satises the scaling equation[23]:

  rxi=1

aiai + h!f (a) = 2f (a).

(48)

this scaling equation is important to calculate the instanton correction to the prepotential

in the weak coupling region[8]. recently it is shown that the prepotential satises further

non-trivial equations [24] obtained from the whitham hierarchy. instanton correction to

the prepotential has been calculated in this framework[25] for some gauge theories. it

would be interesting to study the relation between the wdvv equation approach and

this formulation.

4 superconformal point

one of interesting phenomena in the strong coupling physics of n = 2 supersymmetric

gauge theory is the existence of non-trivial n = 2 superconformal xed point in the

coulomb branch[11, 26, 27]. at this point, massless solitons of mutually nonlocal charges

coexist. the superconformal eld theory is characterized by the scaling operators with

non-trivial (fractional) scaling dimensions. in particular, the calculations of the scaling

exponents based on the exact solution suggest that the superconformal xed points are

characterized by the a-d-e classication[27]. we will study this rg xed point in view

of the picard-fuchs equations obtained in the previous section.

for g = ade, the superconformal xed points exist at

t1 =    = tr1 = 0,

tr = 2.

we take the plus sign without loss of generality. let us introduce new at coordinates ti
by shifting tr by 2:

ti = ti,

(i = 1,   , r  1),

tr = tr + 2

(49)

since the ope coecients c k

ij(t) are independent of tr [8], the gauss-manin system does

not change its form under this change of coordinates:

 titj 

rxk=1

k(t)tk tr!  = 0,

and consider the limit   0. we are interested in the solution of the sw periods which
behave like

as   0. since

ti = qii,

the gauss-manin system (50) for i, j < r becomes the dierential equations for f () with

where c k

ij() = c k

ij(t)qi+qj qkh. as for the scaling equation (51), the second term is
dominant in the superconformal limit. we thus nd that f () should satisfy the equation

  

h + 2

qlll# f () = 0

r1xl=1

this equation determines the exponent  in (53) such as

 =

(56)

(57)

the superconformal eld theory is characterized by the scaling operator trqi, whose

conformal dimension is measured with respect to the bps mass (1). from (53) and (57),

we have

htrqii  (mbp s)

2qi
h+2

12

(58)

thus the scaling dimension of htrqii is 2qi/(h + 2), which agrees with the result of [27].
we could examine the above arguments from the viewpoint of the sw curve. in terms

of the parameters t, the sw curve becomes

z +

2
z

= wg(x; t) = wg(x; t)  2.

let us introduce  by

 = z +


z

.

(59)

(60)

then the curve is expressed in the form of the ade superpotential with the gaussian
part 2:

the sw dierential then becomes

2 = wg(x; t).

sw =

in the superconformal limit, expanding the above formula around  = 0 we obtain

2n+1

wg(x, t)

up to the total derivative term. after rescaling x = x, the leading term in (63) is

sw =

2i



h+2

2 qwg(x; 1,   , r1, 1)dx +    ,

(61)

(62)

(63)

(64)

which also leads to the exponent (57). note that the derivative of the sw period integrals:

is the period of the curve

h+2

qwg(x; )
y2 = wg(x; 1,   , r1, 1).

(65)

thus we nd that the superconformal xed point is simply characterized by the ade
superpotential wg(x, t). the sw curve reduce to the hyperelliptic type curve (65). for
example, let us consider the a2 case. the sw curve (65) is given by

y2 = x3  x  1,

13

which is nothing but the curve of su(2) gauge theory with nf = 1 at the superconformal

point (the small torus in [11]). the gauss-manin system (50) becomes

(cid:20)(43  27)2

(cid:21) f () = 0.

(66)

one may solve this equation around  = 0 found that the results agree with those obtained

in [11].

5 discussion

in this paper, we have seen the close relationship between the four-dimensional gauge

theory with ade gauge group and two-dimensional topological lg models coupled to

topological gravity. we have examined the exact solutions around the superconformal

points using the picard-fuchs equations and showed that the superconformal points are

simply characterized by the a-d-e singularity. for other gauge theories with or without

matter hypermultiplets, on the other hand, it is dicult to extend the present results

because of the complexity of the superpotential. but at the superconformal point we would

expect that the curves become simple and are classied by the a-d-e singularity[27].

the two-dimensional topological eld theory would provide a useful tool for analyzing

the physics in both weak and strong coupling region.

it seems interesting to compare the expansion (63) of the sw dierential around the

superconformal point with that around the origin (ti = 0) of the coulomb branch:

sw = 

1
2i

1

42

xn=0

(2n)!

22n(n!)2

wg(x, t)2n+1dx
(2n + 1)(42)n .

(67)

in [10], it has been shown that the period integrals of (67) are expressed directly in terms of
the one-point function hn(i)i of the n-th gravitational descendant n(i) of the primary
eld i in two-dimensional topological lg models coupled to topological gravity. the one-

point function satises the same gauss-manin system, which is evaluated by the residue

integrals[15]:

hn(i)i = bn,i

iji wg(x, t)

rxj=1

ej
h +n+1,

(68)

14

where bn,i is certain constant. in this formulation, the gauss-manin system (38) is also

derived from the topological recursion relation [17]:

hn(i)xy i =xj hn1(i)jihjxy i

and the puncture equation (in the small phase space):

hp

syi=1

ni(i)i =

sxi=1h

syj=1

nj ji(j )i.

(69)

(70)

one might expect that the similar relation would be hold in the superconformal case,

which would be important to understand the relation between the sw theory and d < 1

topological strings.
