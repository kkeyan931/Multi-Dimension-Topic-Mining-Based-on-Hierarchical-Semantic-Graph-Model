abstract

we develop a new, systematic approach towards studying the integrability of
the ordinary calogero-moser-sutherland models as well as the elliptic calogero
models associated with arbitrary (semi-)simple lie algebras and with symmetric
pairs of lie algebras.
it is based on the introduction of a function f , dened
on the relevant root system and with values in the respective cartan subalgebra,
satisfying a certain set of combinatoric identities that ensure, in one stroke, the
existence of a lax representation and of a dynamical r-matrix, given by com-
pletely explicit formulas. it is shown that among the simple lie algebras, only
those belonging to the a-series admit such a function f , whereas the aiii-series
of symmetric pairs of lie algebras, corresponding to the complex grassmannians
su (p, q)/s(u (p)  u (q)), allows non-trivial solutions when |p  q|  1. apart
from reproducing all presently known dynamical r-matrices for calogero models,
our approach provides new ones, namely for the ordinary models when |pq| = 1
and for the elliptic models when |p  q| = 1 or p = q .

1 introduction

the calogero-moser-sutherland models, or calogero models, for short, constitute an
important class of completely integrable hamiltonian systems, intimately related to
the theory of (semi-)simple lie algebras [1-6]. unfortunately, the group-theoretical
underpinnings of their integrability are far less understood than in the case of the toda
models, which allow for a completely general and uniform treatment in terms of root
systems of ordinary (semi-)simple lie algebras and/or ane lie algebras. indeed, it has
proven surprisingly dicult to extend the results obtained for the ordinary calogero
model based on sl(n, c), such as the lax pair found in ref. [2] and the r-matrix given
in ref. [7], to other simple lie algebras.

in recent years, a number of attempts has been made to improve this situation.
one of these is based on hamiltonian reduction, starting out from the geodesic ow on
the corresponding group and leading to the construction of lax pairs and dynamical
r-matrices [8]. however, the approach is rather indirect and the results do not really
crystallize into explicit formulas, except for a few examples that are worked out expli-
citly; moreover, it remains unclear why the traditional more direct approach [4, 5, 6]
works for certain simple lie algebras such as sl(n, c) but fails for others. other authors
have addressed important issues concerning integrability of the elliptic models, where
the pair interaction potential is given by the doubly periodic weierstra function  and
the main objects can be extended to include a spectral parameter  ranging from the
construction of a lax pair [9] and of a dynamical r-matrix [10] in the sl(n, c)-case
to the more recently achieved construction of a lax pair for other simple lie algebras
[11]; however, it seems that dynamical r-matrices for other simple lie algebras are still
missing.

one of the central features that distinguishes the calogero models from the (far
simpler) toda models is that their r-matrix is not a numerical object but has a dy-
namical character. generally speaking, the main function of the r-matrix is to control
the poisson brackets between the components of the lax matrix l, according to the
well-known formula

{l1, l2} = [r12, l1]  [r21, l2] .

(1)

numerical r-matrices are well understood mathematical objects that play an impor-
tant role in the theory of quantum groups. or rather its classical counterpart, the theory
of lie bialgebras [12, 13]. on the other hand, the mathematical status of dynamical
r-matrices is not nearly as clear: there does not even seem to exist any generally ac-
cepted denition. the rst examples of dynamical r-matrices appeared in the study
of the nonlinear sigma models on spheres [15, 16, 17] and, more generally, on rieman-
nian symmetric spaces [18]. unfortunately, the analysis of the underlying algebraic
structure is hampered by technical problems due to the fact that these models are not
ultralocal [19] and hence poisson brackets between components of the transition matrix
t constructed from the lax matrix l show discontinuities that must be removed by

2

regularization. therefore, it seems much more promising to undertake such an analysis
not in the context of two-dimensional eld theory but in the context of mechanics,
where such technical problems are avoided due to nite-dimensionality of the phase
space. this leads us naturally to the calogero models  the only known class of models
with a nite number of degrees of freedom where dynamical r-matrices make their
appearance.

in view of this situation, we have developed a new systematic approach towards
studying the integrability of the calogero models associated with arbitrary (semi-)
simple lie algebras and with symmetric pairs of lie algebras. we show that by intro-
ducing an appropriate function f dened on the relevant root system and taking values
in the respective cartan subalgebra, we can formulate a general ansatz both for the
lax pair and for the r-matrix through which the proof of integrability (equivalence
between the equation of motion and the lax equation l = [l, a]) and the proof of
the poisson bracket relation (1) can be reduced to essentially one and the same set of
combinatorical identities. these state that for any two roots  and 

(with , = gn,) in the case of simple lie algebras and

2 g (f) = , + ,

2 g (f) =  

, +  

,

(2)

(3)

in the case of symmetric pairs; for more details, including an explanation of the no-
tation, we refer to the main body of the text. it is worth noting that this is a highly
overdetermined system of equations which will admit non-trivial solutions only in spe-
cial circumstances; its deeper algebraic meaning is yet to be discovered.

the plan of the paper is as follows. in sect. 2, we briey review the basic notation
and collect the main conventions from the theory of semisimple lie algebras and sym-
metric spaces that are needed in our calculations. then we present the construction of
the lax pair and of the r-matrix for the calogero model, in terms of the function f , for
(semi-) simple lie algebras in sect. 2 and for symmetric pairs in sect. 3, and we show
how both the integrability of the model and the poisson bracket relation (1) can be
reduced to the combinatorical identity given above. moreover, we show in sect. 2 that
the only simple lie algebras for which a function f with the desired property exists are
those belonging to the a-series, i.e., the lie algebras sl(n, c); the resulting r-matrix
coincides with that given in ref. [7] for the ordinary calogero model and with that
given in ref. [10] for the elliptic calogero model. in sect. 3, we study as an example the
aiii-series of symmetric pairs of lie algebras, corresponding to the complex grass-
mannians su(p, q)/s(u(p)  u(q)), and we prove by explicit calculations that there
are non-trivial solutions, depending on free parameters, when |p  q|  1. for p = q,
the r-matrix thus found coincides with that given in ref. [8] for the ordinary calogero
model, while the one derived for the elliptic calogero model is new. for |p  q| = 1,
all r-matrices found seem to be new. together, these also provide r-matrices for all
calogero models, ordinary and elliptic, associated with any one of the four classical
root systems an, bn cn and dn.

2 algebraic preliminaries

root systems belong to the most important and intensively studied objects of discrete
geometry, partly because of the central role they play in various areas of algebra. the
most traditional application of root systems is to the classication of (semi-)simple
lie algebras and of symmetric pairs of lie algebras, due to cartan. in the rst case,
one obtains only the so-called reduced root systems, whereas the second case leads to
general root systems, reduced as well as non-reduced ones, and to the appearance of
non-trivial multiplicities.

throughout this paper, g will always denote a complex semisimple lie algebra.
fixing a cartan subalgebra h of g, let h denote its dual,   h the root system of
g with respect to g and h
r the real subspace of h spanned by the roots  (  ).
furthermore, let (. , .) be the invariant bilinear form on g, normalized so that with
respect to the induced bilinear forms on h and h, also denoted by (. , .) and related to
each other by

(, ) = (h, h) ,

(4)

with

for all h  h ,

(h, h) = (h)

(5)
the long roots have length 2. the real subspace of h spanned by the generators h
(  ), on which (. , .) is positive denite, will be denoted by hr. we also x a weyl
chamber c and a weyl alcove a; these are open subsets of hr with boundaries formed by
hyperplanes on which some root    vanishes and by hyperplanes on which some root
   assumes integer values, respectively. recall that the choice of a weyl chamber
c establishes an ordering in , the positive roots being the ones that assume strictly
positive values on c. the dierent weyl chambers are permuted by the elements of
the weyl group w (g) of g, which is the nite group generated by the reections s in
hr along the roots   . finally we choose a basis of generators {e /   } in g
normalized so that
(6)

(e, e) = +,0

and therefore obeying the standard cartan-weyl commutation relations

[h, e] = (h) e

for all h  h ,

[e, e] = h ,

[e, e] = n, e+ ,

(7)

(8)

(9)

with structure constants n, which satisfy n, = n, and which, by denition,
are supposed to vanish whenever  +  is not a root  in particular when    = 0 .
these conditions determine uniquely the h (according to eqn (5)) but not the e,
because it is always possible to rescale the root generators e according to

e  e

 = a e

with aa = 1

(10)

4

which entails a rescaling of the structure constants according to

n,  n 

, =

aa
a+

n, .

(11)

this freedom can be used in order to impose the additional normalization conditions

n, =  n, .

(12)

as it it turns out, this determines the root generators e and the structure constants
n, uniquely up to signs. another important relation between the structure constants
that we shall use frequently is the following cyclic identity: if , ,    are any three
roots that add up to zero, then

n, = n, = n, .

(13)

in addition, assuming that r is the rank of g, we may choose an orthonormal basis
{h1, . . . , hr} of hr; then

r

(hj)hj = h .

(14)

xj=1

in the subsequent computations we shall make extensive use of these relations, often
without further mention. for proofs, see for example [20].

in the symmetric space situation, we shall assume more specically that g is the
complexication of a real semisimple lie algebra g0 of rank r and that we are given a
direct decomposition

of g induced from a cartan decomposition

g = k  m

of g0; then

g0 = k0  m0

gk = k0  im0

(15)

(16)

(17)

denes a compact real form gk of g. writing  for the conjugation in g with respect
to g0 and  for the conjugation in g with respect to gk (note that these commute), the
corresponding cartan involution  is simply their product:  =  =  . this is an
involutive automorphism of g which is +1 on k and 1 on m; moreover, it preserves the
invariant bilinear form (. , .) on g introduced before, which means that the direct sums
in eqns (15)-(17) are orthogonal, characterizing the direct decompositions (16) and (17)
as being associated with a riemannian symmetric space of the noncompact type and
of the compact type, respectively. the decomposition of elements corresponding to the
direct decompositions (15)-(17) into eigenspaces under  is written as

x = xk + xm ,

(18)

5

where obviously

xk = 1

2 (x + x) , xm = 1

2 (x  x) .

(19)

next, let a0 denote a maximal abelian subalgebra of m0, h0 a maximal abelian subal-
gebra of g0 with a0  h0, b0 its orthogonal complement in h0 and let a, b and h denote
the corresponding complexications; then h is a cartan subalgebra of g and

h = b  a
h0 = b0  a0

with
with

b = h  k
b0 = h  k0

a = h  m ,
,
, a0 = h  m0 .

the real subspace hr of h introduced before then splits according to

hr = ib0  a0

(20)

(21)

and the decomposition of elements corresponding to the direct decompositions (20)-(21)
into eigenspaces under  is written as

where obviously

h = hb + ha ,

hb = 1

2 (h + h) , ha = 1

2 (h  h) .

(22)

(23)

next, we note that the conjugations ,  and the involution  induce bijective trans-
formations of the root system  onto itself that for the sake of simplicity will again be
denoted by ,  and , respectively; they are characterized by the condition

(g) = g ,  (g) = g  , (g) = g ,

where g is the one-dimensional subspace of g generated by e and are explicitly given
by

()(h) = (h) , ( )(h) = ( h) , ()(h) = (h)

for h  h . (24)

in the following we write  for the linear functional on a obtained by restricting a given
in this way the root system   h gives rise to the
linear functional  on h to a.
restricted root system   a:

accordingly the root system  itself decomposes into two parts,

 = {  = |a /   } .

where

 =   0 ,

 = {    /  6= } = {    /  6= 0} ,
0 = {    /  = } = {    /  = 0} ,

6

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

where obviously 0 is the root system of the subalgebra k since linear functionals on
h whose restriction to a vanishes may be naturally identied with linear functionals
on b.
in contrast to ordinary roots, restricted roots will in general have non-trivial
multiplicities, dened as follows:

m = card{    /  = } .

(29)

as before, we also x a weyl chamber c and a weyl alcove a, but these are now open
subsets of a0 (rather than of hr) with boundaries formed by hyperplanes on which some
root    vanishes and by hyperplanes on which some root    assumes integer
values, respectively. the choice of such a weyl chamber c now establishes an ordering
only in , the positive roots in  being the ones that assume strictly positive values on
c, but this can of course be extended to an ordering in . it is interesting and useful
to note the behavior of the conjugations ,  and of the involution  with respect to
this ordering:

   =    ,   =   ,    ,
  0 =  =   ,   =   ,  =  .

again, the dierent weyl chambers are permuted by the elements of the weyl group
w (g, ) of (g, ), which is the quotient of the subgroup w(g) of the weyl group w (g)
of g consisting of those elements that commute with the involution , modulo those
elements that act trivially on a0. finally we assume the basis of generators {e /   }
in g to be chosen so that, apart from the normalization condition (6), the cartan-weyl
commutation relations (7), the additional normalization condition (12) and the cyclic
identity (13), we have the following simple behavior under the conjugations ,  and
the involution :

e =  e ,
 e =  e ,
e = e .

in particular, the structure constants are -invariant:

n, = n, .

(30)

(31)

that such a choice is always possible is a non-trivial statement which apparently cannot
be easily found in the literature and whose proof we therefore present in appendix 1.
in addition, assuming that r is the rank of the symmetric pair (g, ) and r+s is the rank
of the lie algebra g (which by denition means that r = dim a and r + s = dim h), we
may also choose an orthonormal basis {h1, . . . , hr} of a0 together with an orthonormal
basis {hr+1, . . . , hr+s} of ib0 to form an orthonormal basis {h1, . . . , hr+s} of hr; then

(hj)hj = (h)a ,

(hj)hj = (h)b .

3 calogero models for semisimple lie algebras

3.1 denition of the models, lax pairs and r-matrices

with the conventions stated above we can introduce the calogero model associated
with the root system  of the lie algebra g. to begin with, we have to specify the
conguration space of the theory, which in the case of the ordinary (rational or trigono-
metric) calogero model is the previously mentioned weyl chamber c and in the case
of the elliptic calogero model is the previously mentioned weyl alcove a. in any case,
q is an open subset of hr, so the phase space of the model is the associated cotangent
bundle t q = q  h
r, which for the sake of simplicity will often be identied with
the tangent bundle t q = q  hr. the hamiltonian for the ordinary (rational or
trigonometric) calogero model is dened by

h(q, p) =

1

2(cid:16)

r

xj=1

p2

j + x  

g

2

 w((q))2(cid:17) ,

while that for the elliptic calogero model is dened by

h(q, p) =

1

2(cid:16)

r

xj=1

p2

j + x  

g

2

 ((q))(cid:17) ,

(33)

(34)

where w is a smooth, real-valued function on r\{0} to be specied soon, while  denotes
the doubly periodic weierstra function (see below). the coecients g (  ) are
positive real coupling constants satisfying the condition

g = g .

(35)

a stronger assumption that we shall always make is that they are invariant under the
action of the weyl group w (g) of g:

gw = g

for all w  w (g) .

(36)

for later use we introduce the following combination of coupling constants and structure
constants:

using the abbreviations

, = g+ n, .

p =

r

xj=1

pjhj

, q =

qjhj ,

r

xj=1

(37)

(38)

we can write the hamiltonian equations of motion as vector equations in hr: they read

q = p

p =  x

q = p ,

p =  1

2 x

 ((q)) h

g

(40)

for the elliptic calogero model.

concerning the choice of the potential functions w in eqn (33) and  in eqn (34), it
is well known that these functions must satisfy a certain set of functional equations that
we shall discuss briey in order to make our presentation self-contained. an elementary
property is that w is supposed to be odd while  is even:

w(t) =  w(t) , (t) = (t) .
the basic functional equation imposed on w is the following:

(cid:16) w(s)

w(s)

+

w(t)

w(t) (cid:17) w(s + t) + w(s) w(t) = 0 .

(41)

(42)

dierentiating with respect to s and to t and subtracting the results gives a second
functional equation:

(cid:16) w(s)
2 w(s) 

w(t)

2 w(t)(cid:17) w(s + t) = w(s) w(t)  w(s) w(t) .

(43)

the solutions are derived in refs [4, 5, 6]: there are essentially three dierent ones,
satisfying the relation

w(t)
2 w(t)  w(t)2 = 

k
2

,

(44)

(45)

where k is a numerical constant that allows to distinguish between them, namely

w(t) = 1/ t

with

k = 0 ,

w(t) = 1/ sin t

w(t) = 1/ sinh t

with k = +1 ,
with k = 1 ,

which explains the terminology rational (for the rst case) and trigonometric (for
the last two cases). on the other hand,  is a meromorphic function on the complex
plane with second order poles at the points of its lattice of periodicity , consisting of
the integer linear combinations n11 + n22 of its two basic periods 1 and 2, which
are two arbitrarily chosen but xed complex numbers; explicitly, it can be dened by
the series expansion

(z) =

1

z2 xn1,n2  z

(n1,n2)6=(0,0)

(cid:18)

1

(z  n11  n22)2 

1

(n11 + n22)2(cid:19) .

9

for later use, it will be convenient to also introduce the weierstra sigma function,
an entire function on the complex plane that can be dened by the innite product
expansion

(z) = z yn1,n2  z

(n1,n2)6=(0,0)

(cid:18)1 

z

n11 + n22(cid:19) exp(cid:26)

z

n11 + n22

+

1
2

z2

(n11 + n22)2(cid:27)

and the weierstra zeta function, another meromorphic function on the complex plane
with rst order poles at the points of the same lattice of periodicity, which can be
dened by the series expansion

(z) =

obviously,

finally, we set

1

z xn1,n2  z

(n1,n2)6=(0,0)

(cid:18)

1

z  n11  n22

+

z + n11 + n22

n11 + n22 (cid:19) .

(z) =

(z)
(z)

, (z) =   (z) .

(z1, z2) =

(z1 + z2)
(z1)(z2)

.

(46)

(47)

clearly, these functions have the following symmetry properties under reection at the
origin:

(z) =  (z) , (z) =  (z) , (z) = (z) ,

(z1,z2) =  (z1, z2) .

(48)

(49)

moreover, they satisfy a set of functional equations that can all be derived from a single
quartic identity for the weierstra sigma function, namely

(z1 + z2) (z1  z2) (z3 + z4) (z3  z4)
+ (z2 + z3) (z2  z3) (z1 + z4) (z1  z4)
+ (z3 + z1) (z3  z1) (z2 + z4) (z2  z4) = 0 .

we shall restrict ourselves to listing the identities that will actually be needed in the
following calculations: they are

(s, u) (s, u) =  ((s)  (u)) ,

(s, u) (s, u)  (s, u) (s, u) = (s) ,

(s, u) (t, u)  (s, u) (t, u) = ((s)  (t)) (s + t, u) ,

(s, v  u) (s + t, v) + (t, u  v) (s + t, u) =  (s, u) (t, v) ,

(s, u  v) (s, u) + ((v  u) + (u)) (s, v) = (s, v) ,

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

10

where  denotes the derivative of  with respect to the rst argument and all arguments
must be dierent from zero mod . note that, for example, eqn (51) can be immediately
derived from eqn (50) by dierentiation with respect to the rst argument and from eqn
(52) by passing to the limit s + t  0. note also that these properties do not depend
on the choice of the periods 1 and 2, but for the applications we have in mind, it will
be important to suppose that 1 equals 1 whereas 2 is a complex parameter, usually
denoted by  .

with these preliminaries out of the way, we can pass to discuss the lax pair and
the r-matrix of the calogero model. it is at this point that an important dierence
between the ordinary and the elliptic calogero models appears, because the lax pair
and the r-matrix of the latter depend on spectral parameters that are absent in the
former. however, these do not enter through the root system, as happens in the toda
models, but rather show up explicitly in the coecient functions.

within the present framework, the lax pair consists of two mappings1

l : t q  g

and

a : q  g

(55)

each of which will in the elliptic case depend on an additional spectral parameter u, such
that the hamiltonian equations of motion can be rewritten in the lax form, namely

l = [l, a]

for the ordinary (rational or trigonometric) calogero model and

l(u) = [l(u), a(u)]

for the elliptic calogero model. similarly, the dynamical r-matrix is a mapping1

r : q  g  g

(56)

(57)

(58)

which will in the elliptic case depend on two additional spectral parameters u and v,
such that the poisson brackets of l can be written in the form

for the ordinary (rational or trigonometric) calogero model and

{l1, l2} = [r12, l1]  [r21, l2]

{l1(u), l2(v)} = [r12(u, v), l1(u)]  [r21(v, u), l2(v)]

(59)

(60)

for the elliptic calogero model, where as usual l1 = l  1 , l2 = 1  l and r12 = r ,
r21 = rt , with .t denoting transposition of the two factors in the tensor product.

1as we shall see, a and r depend only on the position variables and not on the momentum variables,

i.e., they are functions on t q that descend to functions on q.

11

as is well known, the lax equations (56) or (57) imply that the ad(g)-invariant poly-
nomials on g are conserved under the hamiltonian ow, whereas the poisson bracket
relations (59) or (60) imply that they are pairwise in involution.

in analogy with the formulas found in the literature for special cases, in particular
the case where g = sl(r + 1, c) [7, 10], we postulate a lax pair and an r-matrix; they
are explicitly given by

(65)

(66)

for the elliptic calogero model. here, the f form a collection of generators which are
supposed to belong to hr and can be viewed as a (vector valued) function

which we shall suppose to be even:

f :   hr

f = f .

(67)

(68)

in the sequel we shall derive a combinatoric equation which determines f completely.
together with the functional equations discussed above, it will be the basic ingredient
for proving the equivalence between the hamiltonian equations of motion and the lax
equations, as well as the validity of the poisson bracket relations.

12

for the elliptic calogero model, the calculation goes as follows. first, we use the
eqns (64) and (65) to compute the following expression for the dierence between the

here, the double sum over commutators [e, e] appearing in the commutator between
l(u) and a(u) has, after antisymmetrization of the coecients in  and , been split
into two contributions, one corresponding to terms where  +  = 0 and the other to
terms where  +  6= 0, which are nonzero only if  +   . inserting the functional

that, for the elliptic calogero model, the lax equations (57) will be equivalent to the
hamiltonian equations of motion (40) if and only if for all roots   , we have

x  

((q)) g(cid:0)2 g (f)  ,  ,(cid:1) = 0 .

(69)

the same calculation with (s, u) replaced by w(s) and (s) replaced by w(s)/2w(s)
leads to the conclusion that, for the ordinary (rational or trigonometric) calogero
models, the lax equations (56) will be equivalent to the hamiltonian equations of
motion (39) if and only if for all roots   , we have

w((q))
2 w((q))

x  

g(cid:0)2 g (f)  ,  ,(cid:1) = 0 .

(70)

since these relations must hold identically in q, we are led to postulate the validity of
the following combinatoric identity:

2 g (f) = , + ,

for ,    .

(71)

passing to the poisson bracket relation (60) in the elliptic case, we use eqn (64) to
compute the lhs, starting out from the canonical poisson brackets

{pj, qk} = jk ,

which give

{pj, ((q), u)} = ((q), u) (hj) ,

and hence, due to the identities (14) and (38),

{p, ((q), u)} = ((q), u) h .

this leads to the following momentum independent expression for the lhs of eqn (60):

{l1(u), l2(v)} = x  

i g(cid:16)((q), v) h  e  ((q), u) e  h(cid:17) .

(72)

to compute the rhs of eqn (60) we observe rst that it is also momentum independent,
since the only possibly momentum dependent terms cancel:

[r12(u, v), p1]  [r21(v, u), p2]

(p)(cid:16)((q), u  v) e  e  ((q), v  u) e  e(cid:17)

= 0 .

the remaining terms are, according to eqn (14),

[r12(u, v), l1(u)  p1]  [r21(v, u), l2(v)  p2]

i g ((u  v) + (v)) ((q), u) e  h

where the last four terms have been obtained by splitting each of the two terms con-
taining tensor products of a root generator with the commutator of two other root
generators, say [e, e]  e or e  [e, e], into two contributions: one corre-
sponding to terms where  +  = 0 and one corresponding to terms where  +   ;
moreover, some renaming of summation indices has been performed. using eqns (12)
and (13) and rearranging terms, we get

inserting the functional equations (53) and (54), we are nally left with

the rst term gives precisely the rhs of eqn (72), so the last double sum must vanish.
thus we are led to conclude that, for the elliptic calogero model, the poisson bracket
relation (60) will hold if and only if the following combinatoric identity is valid:

g (f)  g (f) = ,

for ,    .

(73)

the same calculation with (s, u) and (s, v) both replaced by w(s), (s, u  v) and
(s, vu) both replaced by w(s)/w(s) and  replaced by zero leads to the conclusion
that, for the ordinary (rational or trigonometric) calogero model, the poisson bracket
relation (59) will hold if and only if the same combinatoric identity (73) is valid. more-
over, this identity is easily shown to be equivalent to the previously imposed identity
(71).

the two basic results thus obtained are not entirely independent because the hamil-
tonian is a quadratic function of the l-matrix whereas the a-matrix is essentially just
the composition of the r-matrix with the l-matrix. more precisely, using the invari-
ant bilinear form (. , .) on g to identify g with its dual space g and to reinterpret r
as a linear mapping from g to g rather than as a tensor in g  g,2 we can form the
composition r  l and r(u, v)  l(u), respectively; then

and, due to eqn (44),

h = 1

2 (l, l)

a = r  l

for the ordinary (rational or trigonometric) calogero model while

h = res|u=0(cid:18) 1

2u

(l(u), l(u))(cid:19)

and, due to eqns (50) and (54),

(74)

(75)

(76)

gf

r(u, v)  l(v) = a(u)  ((u  v) + (v)) l(u) + i (v) x  

2more precisely, the convention used is to apply the identication between g and g to the second

factor in the tensor product g  g.

16

a(u) = res|v=u(cid:18) 1
v  u

r(u, v)  l(v)(cid:19) + (u) l(u)

(77)

and hence

for the elliptic calogero model, provided that the function f mentioned above satises
the simple constraint equation

gf = 0 .

x  

(78)

therefore, using the general fact that the poisson bracket relations (59) and (60) imply
the lax equations (56) and (57) if one simply substitutes r l for a and r(u, v) l(u)
for a(u), respectively, shows that with the above choices the lax equations follow from
the poisson bracket relations.
(for the convenience of the reader, the proof of this
general fact is reproduced in appendix 2.)

concluding, we mention the fact that in view of the invariance of the structure

constants n, under the action of the weyl group,

nw,w = n,

for all w  w (g) ,

(79)

together with that of the coupling constants g, as required in eqn (36), the function
f must be covariant (equivariant) under the action of the weyl group:

fw = w(f)

for all w  w (g) .

(80)

3.2 solution of the combinatoric identity

up to now it is not clear whether and eventually for what choice of the coupling
constants g, there exists a (vector valued) function f as in eqn (67), satisfying the
required combinatoric identity (71). in the following, we want to answer this question
in full generality, for all semisimple lie algebras.

to begin with, observe that the problem for semisimple lie algebras is easily reduced
to that for simple lie algebras. in fact, when a semisimple lie algebra is decomposed
into the direct sum of its simple ideals, its root system will be decomposed orthogonally
into irreducible root systems, and since the sum of any two roots belonging to dierent
subsystems is not a root, the combinatoric identity (71) will split into separate identities,
one for each of the simple ideals, and with an independent choice of coupling constants
for each of them.

to analyze the problem for simple lie algebras, we remark rst of all that, due to
the fact that all roots of a simple lie algebra having the same length constitute a single
weyl group orbit, the choice of coupling constants is severely restricted:

17

 g is simply laced  ar (r 1), dr (r 4), e6, e7, e8:

all roots have the same length, and there is only a single coupling constant g,
which should be nonzero. as a result, the coupling constants drop out from eqn
(71), which reduces to

2 (f) = n, + n, .

(81)

 g is not simply laced  br (r 2), cr (r 3), f4, g2:

the root system splits into precisely two weyl group orbits, and there are precisely
two coupling constants, gl for the long roots and gs for the short roots, at least
one of which should be nonzero.
in fact, we can be somewhat more precise,
requiring that for the simple lie algebras so(2r + 1, c) of the b-series, gl should
be nonzero while for the simple lie algebras sp(2r, c) of the c-series, gs should
be nonzero; when r = 2, both should be nonzero. otherwise, the hamiltonian of
the corresponding calogero model (as given in eqns (33) or (34)) would decouple,
that is, would decompose into the sum of r copies of the same hamiltonian for a
system with only one degree of freedom, and such a system is trivially completely
integrable.

note also that the function f , if it exists, must be unique, since otherwise all coupling
constants would have to vanish. (the argument relies on the fact that even when there
are roots of dierent length, the space h
r is already generated both by the long roots
and by the short roots alone.)

a trivial case is that of the simplest of all simple lie algebras, namely the unique
one of rank 1, sl(2, c). here, we may simply set f  0 because there is just a single
positive root, so that the rhs of the combinatoric identity (71) vanishes identically.

more generally, a particular role is played by the simple lie algebras sl(n, c) of
the a-series. to handle this case, we rst x some notation. the correctly normalized
invariant bilinear form on sl(n, c) is the trace form in the dening representation, which
can in fact be extended to a non-degenerate invariant bilinear form on gl(n, c):

(x, y ) = trace (xy )

for x, y  gl(n, c) .

(82)

letting indices a, b, . . . run from 1 to n, we introduce the standard basis of gl(n, c)
consisting of the matrices eab with 1 at the position where the a-th row and the b-th
column meet and with 0 everywhere else; they satisfy the multiplication rule

and hence the commutation relation

eabecd = bcead

[eab, ecd] = bcead  daecb .

18

(83)

(84)

the cartan subalgebra h of g = sl(n, c) will be the usual one, consisting of all trace-
less diagonal matrices; this can be extended to the standard cartan subalgebra h of
g = gl(n, c), consisting of all diagonal matrices; then hr and hr consist of all real
traceless diagonal and of all real diagonal matrices, respectively. obviously, the matri-
ces ha  eaa form an orthonormal basis of hr and the linear functionals ea given by
projection of a diagonal matrix h to its entries,

ea(h) = haa

for h  hr ,

form the orthonormal basis of h

r dual to the previous one. moreover, setting

e = e1 + . . . + en ,

(85)

(86)

we see that h
next, the root system of sl(n, c) is given by

r can be identied with the orthogonal complement of e in h

r and r = n1.

 = { ab = ea  eb / 1  a 6= b  n} ,

with root generators eab  eab (1  a 6= b  n) and with

hab = eaa  ebb .

(87)

(88)

the commutation relations (84) then lead to the following explicit expression for the
structure constants nab,cd  nab,cd :

nab,cd = bc  ad ,

(89)

valid for 1  a, b, c, d  n with a 6= b and c 6= d. moreover, using the aforementioned
orthonormal bases to identify hr and h
r with rn, we see that the weyl reection sab
along the root ab operates on a vector in rn by simply permuting the a-th and the b-th
component, so the weyl group w (sl(n, c)) of sl(n, c) is just the permutation group in
n letters.

with these preliminaries out of the way, we proceed to search for a collection of
matrices fab  fab (1  a 6= b  n) that belong to hr, with fba = fab as required
in eqn (68), satisfying the property (80) of covariance under the weyl group and the
combinatoric identity

2 ((fab)cc  (fab)dd) = 2 cd(fab) = ncd,ab + ncd,ba = da  cb + db  ca ,

(90)

valid for 1  a, b, c, d  n with a 6= b and c 6= d, corresponding to eqn (81). obviously,
the rhs vanishes if the sets {c, d} and {a, b} coincide and also if they are disjoint. this
means that the a-th and b-th entry of the matrix fab have to be equal and also that all
other entries of the matrix fab have to be equal among themselves. thus we can write

fab =

1
2

ab (eaa + ebb) +

1
n

ab 1 ,

19

with real coecients ab and ab to be determined. if on the other hand we choose c and
d so that the intersection of the sets {c, d} and {a, b} contains precisely one element,
the rhs is equal to 1, and the equation is solved by putting ab = 1 whereas the
other coecient is xed to be ab = 1 by the condition that fab should be traceless.
the result is the following

theorem 3.1 for the complex simple lie algebras sl(n, c) of the a-series, there exists
a non-trivial solution to the combinatoric identity (71) which is given by

fab = 

1
2

(eaa + ebb) +

1
n

1 .

(91)

this solution also satises the constraint equation (78).

the question whether other complex simple lie algebras admit a similar solution has
a negative answer:

theorem 3.2 let g be a complex simple lie algebra not belonging to the a-series, i.e.,
not isomorphic to any of the complex simple lie algebras sl(n, c). then the combina-
toric identity (71) has no solution.

in the proof, we shall for the sake of simplicity use the pertinent invariant bilinear form
(. , .) to identify the space hr with its dual h
r and introduce a basis {e1, . . . , en} which
is orthonormal except possibly for an overall normalization factor; then the root system
 will be considered as a nite subset of rn and f will be a map from  to rn required
to satisfy the combinatoric identity

2 g (, f) = , + ,

for ,    .

as observed before, when g is simply laced, this relation reduces to

2 (, f) = n, + n,

for ,    .

in particular, the solution for an given by eqn (91) is recast into the form

fab = 

1
2

(ea + eb) +

1
n

e

(1  a 6= b  n) .

(92)

(93)

(94)

we begin with the case of the complex simple lie algebras so(2n, c) of the d-series,

with n  4, which are simply laced and for which  consists of the following roots:

 kl =  (ek  el) ,  kl =  (ek + el)

expanding the generators fkl  fkl and f 
respect to the orthonormal basis {e1, . . . , en} of rn, we now argue as follows.

kl  fkl

(1  k < l  n) .
in their components with

(95)

20

 when the sets {p, q} and {k, l} are disjoint (this possibility exists because we are
assuming n  4), none of the expressions  pq  kl,  pq  kl,  pq  kl,
 pq  kl
is a root, so using eqn (93) with  = pq as well as  = pq and
 = kl as well as  = kl, we infer that both fkl and f 
kl must be orthogonal
to both pq and pq, i.e., to ep and to eq. in other words, the components of fkl
and of f 
kl along any basis vector except ek and el must vanish, i.e., both fkl and
f 

kl must be linear combinations of ek and el.

 when the sets {p, q} and {k, l} are equal, then once again none of the expressions
 pq  kl,  pq  kl,  pq  kl,  pq  kl is a root, so using eqn (93) with
 = pq as well as  = pq and  = kl as well as  = kl, we infer that both
fkl and f 
kl must be orthogonal to both kl and kl, i.e., to ek and to el. in other
words, the components of fkl and of f 
kl along the basis vectors ek and el must
vanish.

thus we arrive at the conclusion that eqn (93) forces f to be identically zero, which
is of course a contradiction because the rhs of eqn (93) is not identically zero: more
specically, it does not vanish when we set  = pq or  = pq and  = kl or
 = kl, assuming that the intersection of the sets {p, q} and {k, l} contains precisely
one element.

it is interesting to note that the rst part of the above argument fails when n = 3
and a solution indeed exists in this case, with fkl and f 
kl proportional to the basis
vector klmem. this is to be expected due to the isomorphism between so(6, c) and
sl(4, c), which at the level of root systems can be implemented by expressing the basis
vectors e1, e2, e3 for the root system of d3 in terms of the basis vectors e1, e2, e3, e4 for
the root system of a3, as well as their sum e, by setting

ek = ek + e4  1
2 e

(1  k  3) ,

which induces an isomorphism between the corresponding root systems given by

 kl =  kl

,  kl =  klm m4

(1  k < l  3) .

(96)

(97)

thus the solution for a3 given by eqn (94) can be translated into a solution for d3 :

fkl = 1

2 klmem , f 

kl =  1

2 klmem

(1  k < l  3) .

(98)

the proof of the theorem for the other complex simple lie algebras is greatly sim-
plied by comparing the eventual solution for a complex simple lie algebra g with that
for a complex simple lie algebra g when the latter, say, is a subalgebra of the former
of the same rank. in this case, a cartan subalgebra of the latter also serves as a cartan
subalgebra of the former, so that the root system  of g can be identied with a subset
of the root system  of g. it is then clear that the solution for g must restrict to the
solution for g. more specically, this means that for   
 , the generator f for

21

g must (possibly up to a universal normalization factor3) coincide with the generator
f for g. in particular, this makes it obvious that the nonexistence of a solution for g
will automatically imply the nonexistence of a solution for g.

this argument can be immediately applied choosing g to be one of the complex
simple lie algebras so(2n, c) of the d-series, with n  4, to prove the theorem for
almost all other complex simple lie algebras:

 bn (n  4): bn contains dn,
 cn (n  4): cn contains dn,
 e8: e8 contains d8,
 f4: f4 contains d4.

therefore, all that remains is to analyze a few isolated cases, namely b2 = c2, g2,
b3 and c3, e6 and e7. this can be done by applying similar arguments to the ones
already used before.

 b2 = c2 or so(5, c) = sp(4, c) :

the root system consists of four long roots and four short roots, which can be
written in the form

long roots:  e1  e2
short roots:  e1 , e2

when g is realized as so(5, c) (b2) or in the form

long roots:  2e1 ,  2e2
short roots:

 e1  e2

(99)

(100)

when g is realized as sp(4, c) (c2). either way, analyzing the combinatoric iden-
tity (92) with  any long root results in a contradiction (provided we take into
account the condition that neither of the two coupling constants gl and gs should
vanish): when  is a long root, neither of the two expressions  +  and   
will be a root, so the rhs must vanish, leading to the conclusion that f must
vanish, but when  is a short root, then one and only one of the two expressions
 + and  will be a root, so the rhs cannot vanish, leading to the conclusion
that f cannot vanish.

3if the index of the embedding of g into g is not equal to 1, some formulas will be modied because

it will appear as a normalization factor relating the invariant bilinear forms for g and for g.

22

 b3 or so(7, c) and c3 or sp(4, c) :

the root system for b3 consists of twelve long roots and six short roots, which
can be written in the form

long roots:  ek  el
short roots:

 ek

(1  k < l  3)
(1  k  3)

,

(101)

while the root system for c3 consists of six long roots and twelve short roots,
which can be written in the form

 2ek
long roots:
short roots:  ek  el

(1  k  3)
(1  k < l  3)

.

(102)

note that both systems contain the system d3 as a subsystem: it is generated by
the roots of the form  ek  el (1  k < l  3). therefore, the values of f on any
root  of this form must, according to eqn (98), be proportional to klmem. but
then analyzing the combinatoric identity (92) with  any root of this form and
 any root of the form em (for b3) or 2em (for c3) results in a contradiction
(provided we take into account the condition that the coupling constants gl for
b3 and gs for c3 should not vanish): when m is equal to k or l, then one and only
one of the two expressions  +  and    will be a root, so the rhs cannot
vanish whereas the lhs is obviously equal to zero; similarly, when m is dierent
from both k and l, then neither of the two expressions  +  and    will
be a root, so the rhs must vanish, whereas the lhs is typically dierent from zero
(except when the other coupling constant (gs for b3 and gl for c3) vanishes).

 g2 :

the root system consists of six long roots and six short roots, which can be written
in the form

long roots:  kl =  (2jklej  ek  el)
short roots:

 kl =  (ek  el)

(1  k < l  3)
(1  k < l  3)

,

(103)

spanning the subspace orthogonal to the vector e = e1 + e2 + e3. note that this
system is the disjoint union of two subsystems that are copies of the system a2.
in particular, the value of f on any short root kl must, according to eqn (94), be
proportional to the long root kl. but then analyzing the combinatoric identity
(92) with  any short root and  the corresponding long root results in a con-
tradiction (provided we take into account the condition that neither of the two
coupling constants gl and gs should vanish because otherwise, we would really be
dealing not with a g2 model but with an a2 model in disguise): since neither of
the two expressions kl + kl and kl  kl will be a root, the rhs must vanish,
whereas the lhs is typically dierent from zero (except when the coupling constant
gl vanishes).

23

 e7 :

the root system consists of 126 roots, all of the same length, spanning a 7-
dimensional subspace of r8, which can be written in the form

 kl =  (ek  el)
 78 =  (e7  e8)
 kl =  (ek + el)

(1  k < l  6)

 ,..., =  1

(1  k < l  6)
(1)s(k) ek!
xk=1
where the s(k) (k = 1, . . . , 6) are 0 or 1 and such that p6
is odd.
applying the same arguments as in the dn case, we see that fkl and fkl
(1  k < l  6) must be orthogonal to ek (k = 1, . . . , 6) as well as to e7  e8 and
can therefore be expressed in the form

2 e8  e7 +

k=1 s(k)

(104)

,

6

fkl = fkl (e7 + e8)
fkl = fkl (e7 + e8)

.

obviously, these generators are also orthogonal to all roots of the form ,...,.
but then analyzing the combinatoric identity (93) with  = kl or  = kl and
 an appropriate root of the form ,..., results in a contradiction. for example,
letting 12 be any root of the form

1

2 (e8  e7  (e1  e2)  e3  e4  e5  e6)

with an even number of minus signs, we see that 12  12 is not a root whereas
12 + 12 is a root, so the rhs cannot vanish, whereas the lhs is necessarily equal
to zero.

 e6 :

the root system consists of 72 roots, all of the same length, spanning a 6-
dimensional subspace of r8, which can be written in the form

 kl =  (ek  el)
 kl =  (ek + el)

(1  k < l  5)
(1  k < l  5)

 ,..., =  1

(1)s(k) ek! ,
where the s(k) (k = 1, . . . , 5) are 0 or 1 and such that p5

is even.
applying the same arguments as in the dn case, we see that fkl and fkl must
be orthogonal to ek with k = 1, . . . , 5 and can therefore be expressed in the form

2 e8  e7  e6 +

xk=1

k=1 s(k)

to show that these generators are also orthogonal to the vector e8  e7  e6 and
hence to all roots of the form ,...,, we use the combinatoric identity (93) with
 = kl or  = kl and  an appropriate root of the form ,...,. for example,
letting 

12 be any root of the form

1

2 (e8  e7  e6 + (e1 + e2)  e3  e4  e5)

with an even number of minus signs and letting +

12 be any root of the form

1

2 (e8  e7  e6 + (e1  e2)  e3  e4  e5)

12 + 12 nor +

12 + 12 nor 

12 and f12 to be orthogonal to +

with an odd number of minus signs, we see that neither 
12 12 is
a root and neither +
12  12 is a root, forcing f12 to be orthogonal
to 
12, so both must be orthogonal to the vector
e8  e7  e6 and hence to all roots of the form ,...,. but then analyzing the
combinatoric identity (93) with  = kl or  = kl and  another appropriate
root of the form ,..., results in a contradiction. for example, letting 12 be any
root of the form

1

2 (e8  e7  e6  (e1  e2)  e3  e4  e5)

with an odd number of minus signs, we see that 12  12 is not a root whereas
12 + 12 is a root, so the rhs cannot vanish, whereas the lhs is necessarily equal
to zero.

this completes the proof of our no-go theorem, theorem 3.2.

to conclude this section, we briey summarize the main results. the only integrable
calogero models that allow a lax formulation with a dynamical r-matrix, directly in
terms of simple lie algebras, are the ones based on the simple lie algebras sl(n, c) of
the a-series. using the abbreviation

v (t) = (cid:26) 1

2 w(t)2

for the ordinary (rational or trigonometric) case

for the elliptic case

(cid:27) ,

(106)

for the potential, their hamiltonian (108) or (110) is given by

h(q, p) = 1

2 x1k6=ln

v (qk  ql) ,

(107)

which is the calogero hamiltonian associated to the root system an1. inserting the
solution (91) of the combinatoric identity (71) reproduces the known results, both for
the lax pair [2, 4, 5, 6] and the r-matrix [7, 10]. moreover, our analysis shows why it
is not possible to extend this technique to other simple lie algebras.

4 calogero models for symmetric pairs

4.1 denition of the models, lax pairs and r-matrices

the formulation of the calogero models associated with restricted root systems of
symmetric spaces, rather than ordinary root systems of lie algebras, requires only minor
modications. more specically, we introduce the calogero model associated with the
restricted root system  of the symmetric pair (g, ) as follows. the conguration
space q of the theory is again a weyl chamber c or weyl alcove a in the appropriate
sense, that is, it is now an open subset of a0, and the phase space of the model is the
associated cotangent bundle t q = q  a
0, often identied with the tangent bundle
t q = q  a0. the hamiltonian for the ordinary (rational or trigonometric) calogero
model is then dened by

or equivalently

h(q, p) =

1

2(cid:16)

r

xj=1

p2

j + x

m  g

 w( (q))2(cid:17) ,

h(q, p) =

 w((q))2(cid:17) ,

while that for the elliptic calogero model is dened by

j + x  

m  g

or equivalently

h(q, p) =

r

g

 ((q))(cid:17) ,

where w and  are as before. the coecients g  = g (  ) are positive real coupling
constants whose denition will be extended from  to all of  by setting

they satisfy the symmetry condition (35) and are -invariant:

g = 0

for   0 .

g = g = g .

(112)

(113)

a stronger assumption that we shall always make is that they are invariant under the
action of the subgroup w(g) of w (g) associated with the symmetric pair (g, ):

gw = g

for all w  w(g) .

(114)

26

for later use we introduce the following combination of coupling constants and structure
constants:

 
, = 1

4(cid:16)g+ n, + g+ n, + g+ n, + g+ n,(cid:17) .

using the abbreviations (38) as before, we can write the hamiltonian equations of
motion as vector equations in a0: they read

(115)

q = p ,

p =  x

 w((q)) w((q)) (h)a

for the ordinary (rational or trigonometric) calogero model and

q = p

p =  1

the general considerations on the structure of the lax pair and the r-matrix remain
unaltered, so we may pass directly to postulate a lax pair and an r-matrix; they are
explicitly given by

and the f form a collection of generators which are now supposed to belong to ib0
and can be viewed as a (vector valued) function

f :   ib0
which we shall assume to be even and -invariant:

f = f = f .

(125)

(126)

we shall now once again derive a combinatoric equation which determines f completely
and which, together with the functional equations discussed in the previous section, will
be sucient to prove the equivalence between the hamiltonian equations of motion and
the lax equations, as well as the validity of the poisson bracket relations.

i g ((q), u) ( q) e  x  

basically, the proof goes as previously but it presents some additional subtleties.
as before, we concentrate on the elliptic calogero model. first, we use the eqns (121)
and (122) to compute the following expression for the dierence between the two sides
of the lax equation (57):
l(u)  [l(u), a(u)]
= p + x

here, the double sum over commutators [e, e] appearing in the commutator between
l(u) and a(u) has, after antisymmetrization of the coecients in  and , been split
into three contributions, one corresponding to terms where + = 0, one corresponding
to terms where  +   0 and one corresponding to terms where  +   . inserting
the functional equation (51) to transform the rst two of these contributions (note that

28

 +   0 implies (q) + (q) = 0 for all q  q) and the functional equation (52) to
transform the third contribution (note that  +    implies (q) + (q) 6= 0 mod 
for all q  q) and rearranging terms, we get

the vanishing of the sum of the rst two terms and of the third term are precisely the
equations of motion, so the last double sum must vanish. thus we are led to conclude
that, for the elliptic calogero model, the lax equations (57) will be equivalent to the
hamiltonian equations of motion (117) if and only if for all roots   , we have

x  

((q)) g(cid:0)2 g (f)  ,  ,(cid:1) = 0 .

(127)

the same calculation with (s, u) replaced by w(s) and (s) replaced by w(s)/2w(s)
leads to the conclusion that, for the ordinary (rational or trigonometric) calogero mod-
els, the lax equations (56) are equivalent to the hamiltonian equations of motion (39)
if and only if for all roots   , we have

w((q))
2 w((q))

x  

g(cid:0)2 g (f)  ,  ,(cid:1) = 0 .

(128)

since these relations must hold identically in q but the coecient functions are invariant
under the substitution   , we are led to postulate the validity of the following
combinatoric identity:

2 g (f) =  

, +  

,

for ,    .

(129)

passing to the poisson bracket relation (60) in the elliptic case, we use eqn (121) to
compute the lhs, starting out from the same canonical poisson brackets as before but
now using the identities (32) and (38) to conclude that

{p, ((q), u)} = ((q), u) (h)a ,

leading to the following momentum independent expression for the lhs of eqn (60):

{l1(u), l2(v)} = x  

i g(cid:16)((q), v) (h)a e  ((q), u) e (h)a(cid:17) . (130)

to compute the rhs of eqn (60) we observe rst that it is also momentum independent,
since once again, the only possibly momentum dependent terms cancel:

the remaining terms are, according to eqn (32),

where the last twelve terms have been obtained by splitting each of the four terms
containing tensor products of a root generator with the commutator of two other root
generators, say [e, e]  e or e  [e, e], into three contributions: one corre-
sponding to terms where  +  = 0, one corresponding to terms where  +   0 and
one corresponding to terms where  +   ; moreover, some renaming of summation

the rst term gives precisely the rhs of eqn (130), so the last double sum must vanish.
thus we are led to conclude that, for the elliptic calogero model, the poisson bracket
relation (60) will hold if and only if the following combinatoric identity is valid:

g (f)  g (f) =  

,

for ,    .

(131)

the same calculation with (s, u) and (s, v) both replaced by w(s), (s, u  v) and
(s, vu) both replaced by w(s)/w(s) and  replaced by zero leads to the conclusion
that, for the ordinary (rational or trigonometric) calogero model, the poisson bracket
relation (59) will hold if and only if the same combinatoric identity (131) is valid.
moreover, this identity is easily shown to be equivalent to the previously imposed
identity (129).

once again, the two basic results thus obtained are not entirely independent be-
cause the hamiltonian is a quadratic function of the l-matrix whereas the a-matrix is
essentially just the composition of the r-matrix with the l-matrix. more precisely,

h = 1

2 (l, l)

and, due to eqn (44),

for the ordinary (rational or trigonometric) calogero model while

a = r  l

h = res|u=0(cid:18) 1

2u

(l(u), l(u))(cid:19)

and, due to eqns (50) and (54),

r(u, v)  l(v) = a(u)  1

2 ((u  v) + (u + v)) l(u) + i (v) x

and hence

(132)

a(u) = res|v=u(cid:18) 1
v  u

2 (2u) l(u)

for the elliptic calogero model, provided that the function f mentioned above satises
the simple constraint equation

gf = 0 .

x  

(136)

thus once again, we may conclude that the lax equations follow from the poisson
bracket relations.

concluding, we mention the fact that in view of the invariance of the structure

constants n, under the action of the entire weyl group w (g) of g,

nw,w = n,

for all w  w (g) ,

(137)

34

together with the invariance of the coupling constants g under the action of the sub-
group w(g) of w (g) associated with the symmetric pair (g, ), as required in eqn (114),
the function f must be covariant (equivariant) under the action of this subgroup:

fw = w(f)

for all w  w(g) .

(138)

4.2 solution for the aiii-series

as an example that provides non-trivial solutions to the combinatoric identity (129)
derived above, we consider the symmetric pairs corresponding to the complex grass-
mannians, the symmetric spaces of the aiii-series, which are given by the choice

g = sl(n, c) , g0 = su(p, q) , gk = su(n) ,

(139)

where n = p+q and p  q . in order to take advantage of the calculations performed in
sect. 3.2 for the sl(n, c) case, we choose a representation in which the cartan subalgebra
h of g is the standard one, consisting of purely diagonal matrices; this forces us to deviate
from another standard convention, adopted, e.g., in ref. [20], according to which the
involution  is given by conjugation with a matrix having p entries equal to +1 and q
entries equal to 1 on the diagonal. instead, we shall represent all matrices in sl(n, c)
in the (3  3) block form

n l (cid:16). . .(cid:17)n

and the automorphism  is given by conjugation

taking into account that the conjugation  with respect to the compact real form
gk = su(n) should be given by

 x =  x 

for x  sl(n, c) ,

(143)

where . denotes hermitean adjoint, in order to guarantee that the matrices constituting
gk = su(n) continue to be the traceless antihermitean matrices, we conclude that the
conjugation  with respect to the real form g0 = su(p, q) must in this representation
be given by

x =  jp,qx jp,q
35

for x  sl(n, c) ,

so the matrices constituing g0 = su(p, q) are the traceless matrices of the form

where a, c and d are arbitrary complex matrices whereas b, e and f are antiher-
mitean matrices. similarly, the matrices constituing the intersection k0 of the two real
forms are the traceless matrices of the form

where c1 is an arbitrary complex matrix whereas a1, b1 and e1 are antihermitean
matrices. finally, the matrices belonging to the complementary space m0 appearing in
the decompositions (16) and (17) are the traceless matrices of the form

where c2 is an arbitrary complex matrix whereas a2 is a hermitean matrix and e2 is
an antihermitean matrix. in particular, the p-dimensional subspace a0 that appears as
the ambient space for the conguration space of the calogero models consists of the
real diagonal matrices of the form

whereas its (q  1)-dimensional orthogonal complement ib0 in hr consists of the real
traceless diagonal matrices of the form

continue to let indices a, b, . . . run from 1 to n, but we shall use the following termi-
nology to characterize the subdivision of this range indicated by the (3 3) block form
introduced above: an index a will be said to belong to the rst block if 1  a  p, to
the second block if p + 1  a  q and to the third block if q + 1  a  n; moreover,
we introduce the following abbreviation to characterize the action of the involution 
on these indices:

(a) = a + q

(a) = a
(a) = a  q

for 1  a  p
for p + 1  a  q
for q + 1  a  n

.

(151)

this allows for a considerable simplication of the notation. for example, we have

with

ab = (a)(b) ,

eab = e(a)(b) .

(152)

(153)

in particular, the two parts of the root system  of sl(n, c) appearing in the decom-
position (26) are given by

and

 = { ab   / a or b belongs to the rst or third block} ,

0 = { ab   / a and b belong to the second block } .

for the sake of completeness and for later use, we specify explicitly the elements of
 and the resulting restricted root system , with the corresponding multiplicities.

the corresponding root generators continue to be given by eab  eab (1  a 6= b  n,
with a or b belonging to the rst or third block), since these also satisfy the constraints
listed in eqn (30). however, in contrast to the sl(n, c) case studied in sect. 3.2, we must
now deal with the possibility of encountering nontrivial coupling constants gab  gab
(1  a, b  n). a priori, these are only dened when a or b belong to the rst or third
block, but their denition will be extended to all values of a and b by setting

gab = 0

if a and b belong to the second block ,

(158)

as postulated in to eqn (112), and by adding the convention

gaa = 0 .

(159)

using eqn (89), we can then derive the following simple expressions for the combinations
ab,cd  ab,cd and  
ab,cd introduced in eqns (37) and (115), respectively:

ab,cd   

ab,cd = 1
 

ab,cd = gad bc  gbc ad ,
4(cid:16)gad bc  gbc ad + g(a) d (b) c  g(b) c (a) d
+ ga (d) b (c)  gb (c) a (d) + g(a)(d) (b)(c)  g(b)(c) (a)(d)(cid:17) ,

(160)

(161)

valid for 1  a, b, c, d  n with a 6= b and c 6= d. next, we have for the weyl reections
(162)

sab  = s(a)(b) .

this relation implies that the weyl group w (sl(n, c), ) associated with this symmetric
pair can be realized not only as the quotient of a subgroup but actually as a subgroup
of the weyl group w (sl(n, c)) of sl(n, c), namely the subgroup generated by the re-
ections sa (a) = s(a) a with index a in the rst block (or equivalently in the third
block) and by the products of reections sab s(a)(b) = s(a)(b) sab with both indices a
and b in the rst block (or equivalently in the third block). under the action of this
group,  decomposes into three distinct orbits, namely

{ ab / a and b belong to the rst or third block, b 6= a, b 6= (a)} ,

{ a (a) / a belongs to the rst or third block} ,

n ab .

a belongs to the rst or third block and b to the second block

a belongs to the second block and b to the rst or third blocko ,

or

(163)

(164)

(165)

and so there will be three independent coupling constants which, following refs [4, 5, 6],
we shall denote by g, g1 and g2. explicitly,

38

 gab = g if a and b belong to the rst or third block, with b 6= a and b 6= (a),
 ga (a) = g(a) a = g2 if a belongs to the rst or third block,
 gab = g1 if a belongs to the rst or third block and b to the second block or if a

belongs to the second block and b to the rst or third block.

note also that at least the coupling constant g should be non-zero, since otherwise,
the hamiltonian of the corresponding calogero model (as given in eqns (108), (109) or
(110), (111)) would decouple, that is, would decompose into the sum of p copies of the
same hamiltonian for a system with only one degree of freedom, and such a system is
trivially completely integrable.

with these preliminaries out of the way, we proceed to search for a collection of
matrices fab  fab (1  a 6= b  n, with a or b belonging to the rst or third block)
that belong to ib0, with fba = fab = f(a)(b) as required in eqn (126), satisfying the
property (138) of covariance under the weyl group and the combinatoric identity

cd,ba

(166)

= 1

cd,ab +  

2 gcd ((fab)cc  (fab)dd) = 2 gcd cd(fab) =  
4(cid:16)gcb da  gda cb + gca db  gdb ca
+ g(c) b (d) a  g(d) a (c) b + g(c) a (d) b  g(d) b (c) a
+ gc (b) d (a)  gd (a) c (b) + gc (a) d (b)  gd (b) c (a)
+ g(c)(b) (d)(a)  g(d)(a) (c)(b) + g(c)(a) (d)(b)  g(d)(b) (c)(a)(cid:17) ,
valid for 1  a, b, c, d  n with a 6= b and c 6= d, corresponding to eqn (129). note
that note also that the condition fab  ib0 means that fab must be a real traceless
diagonal matrix whose entries satisfy

(fab)cc = (fab)(c)(c) ,

(167)

whereas the invariance under the reections sa (a) = s(a) a with index a in the rst
block (or equivalently in the third block), which belong to the weyl group w (sl(n, c), )
and act trivially on the space ib0, means that

fab = f(a) b = fa (b) = f(a)(b) .

(168)

therefore, it suces to determine fab in the following three cases: when a and b
both belong to the rst block, with a 6= b, when a belongs to the rst block while
b belongs to the third block, with b = (a), and nally when a belongs to the rst
block while b belongs to the second block. moreover, the system of equations (166) is
obviously invariant under the substitution c  (c), d  (d) and under the exchange
of c and d, as well as under that of a and b. now obviously, the rhs of eqn (166)
vanishes if the sets {c, d} and {a, b, (a), (b)} are disjoint, so eqn (166) will in this
case be satised, independently of the choice of the coupling constants, if we assume

39

all entries of the matrix fab except (fab)aa, (fab)bb, (fab)(a)(a) and (fab)(b)(b) to be
equal among themselves. similarly, the case when the set {c, d} is contained in the set
{a, b, (a), (b)} will provide relations between the remaining entries of the matrix fab.
to nd these, we observe that, due to the invariance mentioned above, it is in this
case sucient to evaluate eqn (166) with c = a and d = b, d = (b), d = (a). now
when a and b both belong to the rst block, with a 6= b, the rst two cases (d = b and
d = (b)) lead to the relation

2 g ((fab)aa  (fab)bb) = 0 ,

while the third (d = (a)) gives a trivial identity. similarly, when a belongs to the rst
block while b belongs to the third block, with b = (a), the rst and last case coincide
(d = b = (a)) and give a trivial identity, while the second (d = (b)) is excluded. thus
taking into account the fact that g 6= 0, we can cover both situations in one stroke by
writing

fab =

1
4

ab(cid:0)eaa + e(a)(a) + ebb + e(b)(b)(cid:1) +

1
n

ab 1

with real coecients ab and ab to be determined. finally, when a belongs to the rst
block while b belongs to the second block, the rst two cases coincide (d = b = (b))
and lead to the relation

while the third (d = (a)) gives a trivial identity, suggesting that we should write

2 g1 ((fab)aa  (fab)bb) = 1

2 g2

with real coecients ab, ab and ab to be determined, subject to the constraint

fab =

1
2

ab(cid:0)eaa + e(a)(a)(cid:1) + ab ebb +
2 g1 (ab  2ab) = g2 .

it remains to check eqn (166) for the cases where the intersection of the sets {c, d}
and {a, b, (a), (b)} contains precisely one element. once again, due to the invariance
mentioned above, it is in this case sucient to evaluate eqn (166) with c = a and
with c = b, supposing that d /{a, b, (a), (b)}. when a and b both belong to the rst
block and also when a belongs to the rst block while b belongs to the third block,
with b = (a), this equation is solved identically, independently of the choice of the
coupling constants, by putting ab = 1. on the other hand, when a belongs to the
rst block while b belongs to the second block, we obtain non-trivial relations between
the coupling constants, which are the following. if c = a 6= b, choosing d /{a, b, (a)}
to belong to the rst or third block gives

2 g ab =  g1 ,

while choosing d /{a, b, (a)} to belong to the second block (which is only possible
when q  p + 2) gives

g1 ab = 0 .

40

similarly, if c = b 6= a, choosing d /{a, b, (a)} to belong to the rst or third block
gives

2 g1 ab =  g ,

while choosing d /{a, b, (a)} to belong to the second block (which is only possible
when q  p + 2) gives

g1 = 0 .

finally, xing the coecients ab by requiring that fab should be traceless, we arrive at
the following

theorem 4.1 for the symmetric pairs associated with the complex grassmannians,
which are the symmetric spaces of the aiii-series corresponding to the choice (139)
with n = p + q and p  q , a non-trivial solution to the combinatoric identity (129)
exists if and only if either q = p or q = p + 1 and is given as follows:

 q = p :

the function f is given by

(169)

(170)

(171)

this solution also satises the constraint equation (136).

the only statement that has not yet been proved is the last one, referring to the
identity (136). this is easily done by computing separately the sum over the dierent

41

weyl group orbits: using the matrices introduced in eqn (150), we see that the rst
gives 4 times a contribution of the form

to conclude this section, it seems worthwhile to briey discuss a few limiting cases,
noting that the vanishing of certain coupling constants allows to eectively reduce the
restricted root system to a subsystem. in fact, eqn (157) reveals that the system of
restricted roots associated with the complex grassmannian su(n, n)/s(u(n)  u(n))
and with the complex grassmannian su(n, n + 1)/s(u(n)  u(n + 1)) is of type cn
and of type bcn, respectively.4 inserting into the hamiltonian (108) or (110) and using
the abbreviation (106) for the potential, we obtain the following special cases:

 su(n, n)/s(u(n)  u(n)), g2 = 0 :

h(q, p) = 1
2

n

xk=1

p2
k + g

2 x1k6=ln

(v (qk  ql) + v (qk + ql))

(174)

which is the calogero hamiltonian associated to the root system dn.

which is the calogero hamiltonian associated to the non-reduced root system
bcn, subject to the constraint imposed by the quadratic equation (173), which
in particular requires g1 6= 0.

thus all calogero hamiltonians associated with the classical root systems are com-
pletely integrable, admitting a lax pair formulation with a dynamical r-matrix.
