abstract. we study the spectral properties of the transfer matrix for a gonihedric

random surface model on a three-dimensional lattice. the transfer matrix is indexed

by generalized loops in a natural fashion and is invariant under a group of motions

in loop-space. the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix can be evaluated exactly in

terms of the partition function, the internal energy and the correlation functions of

the two-dimensional ising model and the corresponding eigenfunctions are explicit

functions on loop-space.

1 introduction

the triviality of simple random surface models on the lattice, due to the dominance

of branched polymers [1], and the non-scaling of the string tension in analogous

euclidean invariant models based on dynamical triangulations [2] made it imperative

to study models with an action depending on the extrinsic curvature of surfaces. for

a review of work in this area up to 1997, see [3].

one of the models with extrinsic curvature dependent action is the so-called

gonihedric random surface model introduced in [4] and further studied in [5, 6,

7]. this model is unstable in the simplest cases [8]. however, there is a lattice

discretization of the model [9, 10] which is not plagued by stability problems and is

more amenable to analytical study, see [11]-[16]. another lattice model with similar

properties was introduced and studied in [17].

in [18] a simplied version of the three-dimensional gonihedric lattice model was

studied and the two largest eigenvalues of the transfer matrix were determined. in

this paper we nish the calculation of the spectrum of the transfer matrix for the

model and nd all the eigenfunctions explicitly.

2 transfer matrix for loops

let t3 denote a sublattice of z3 of size mmn with periodic boundary conditions.
we shall think of the third coordinate direction where the lattice has extension n

as the time direction. the conguration space of the system we wish to study is
a collection of subsets of the plaquettes in t3, denoted m, which we refer to as
singular surfaces or simply as surfaces. a collection of plaquettes m belongs to m
if and only if any link in a plaquette in m belongs to an even number of plaquettes
in m. this means that the surfaces in m do not overlap themselves but they can
intersect themselves at right angles and they are closed. note that the surfaces need
not be connected. it is not hard to see that the conguration space m is identical to
the conguration space of the three-dimensional ising model on the periodic lattice

t3. the surfaces are in one to one correspondence with phase boundaries.

we say that a link  in a surface m  m is an edge if  is contained in exactly
two plaquettes that meet at a right angle. we denote the collection of all edges in

2

m by e(m). the action s(m) of the surface m is dened as the total number of
edges in m

note that no action is associated with those links where the surfaces crosses itself.

s(m) = #e(m).

(1)

the partition function is given by

z() = xm m

es(m ).

(2)

we dene an intermediate plane in r3 to be a plane that lies parallel to but in

between planes where one of the coordinates takes an integer value.

if we slice

a surface m (regarded as a subset of r3) by an intermediate plane we obtain a

collection of links which we shall call generalized loops or simply loops. the collection

of all possible loops that can arise in this way will be denoted . a collection of

links p in an intermediate plane belongs to  exactly when each vertex in p belongs

to an even number of links in p . we note that the loops  coincide with the phase

boundaries that arise in the two-dimensional ising model.

it will not come as a

surprise that this close connection to the ising model will make the present model

exactly soluble in a very strong sense.

for p   we let |p| denote the number of links in p . note that if p1, p2  ,

then the symmetric dierence

(p1  p2) \ (p1  p2)  p1p2  

is again a loop in . it is easy to check that

|p1p2| = |p1| + |p2|  2|p1  p2|

(3)

(4)

and d(p1, p2) = |p1p2| is a metric on .

let k(p ) denote the number of corners of p , i.e. the number of vertices of order 2
whose adjacent links are at right angles. let us denote by h the space of real-valued
functions on . let k be the operator on h whose matrix (kernel) is given by [11]
(5)

k(p1, p2) = exp ((k(p1) + k(p2) + 2|p1p2|)) .

with this notation the partition function of the model can be expressed as

zn () = tr k n


3

(6)

by slicing surfaces in intermediate planes orthogonal to the time direction. this
partition function can be evaluated if we ignore the interesection term |p1  p2|
in this
in the exponent of k or if we replace k(p1) + k(p2) by k(p1p2) [11].
approximation the model becomes a stack of noninteracting two-dimensional models.

the critical beahaviour of the model is identical to that of the two-dimensional ising

model and the free energy can be computed exactly by standard methods [19].

here we will make an approximation dierent from the one of [11]. we drop the

curvature terms in the action and study the simplied transfer matrix

k(p1, p2) = exp(cid:16)2(|p1p2|  m 2)(cid:17) ,

(7)

where we have inserted a normalization factor m 2 in the exponent for later conve-

nience. dropping the curvature term is the same as neglecting the action associated

with edges in the time-direction. we note the mathematical analogy of the transfer
matrix (7) with the transition function exp(|x  y|), x, y  rd, for random walk
in rd. this makes it reasonable to regard k as describing the diusion of loops.

with abuse of notation we denote the new transfer matrix (7) by the same

symbol as the old one (5). this should not cause any confusion since we stick to the

notation of eq. (7) in the sequel.

3 eigenvalues of the transfer matrix

in this section we solve the eigenvalue problem

k(p, q)i(q) = i()i(p ),

(8)

xq

i  h. we prove that only the eigenvalues depend on , not the eigenfunctions.
the eigenvalues can all be expressed in terms of the partition function, the internal

energy and the spin correlation functions of the two-dimensional ising model. the

eigenfunctions are explicit functions on  which can be normalized to take only the
values 1 and 1.
note rst that

xq

k(p, q) = xq

e2(|q|m 2)

= 0(),

4

(9)

where we have in the rst step shifted the summation variable from q to pq
(permissible since the mapping p 7 pq is bijective) and 0() is the partition
function of a two-dimensional ising model on a periodic m  m lattice. this lattice
will be denoted t2. the loops q are the phase boundaries of the ising model and

the ising spin variables sit on the lattice dual to t2.

it follows from eq. (9) that the constant function is an eigenfunction of k and

0() is the corresponding eigenvalue. since all matrix elements of k are positive

and all entries in the eigenvector corresponding to 0 have the same sign, it follows

from the perronfrobenius theorem that 0 is simple and it is the largest eigenvalue

of k. we conclude [18] that the free energy per site in the present model is the

same as the free energy per site in the two-dimensional ising model. in particular,

the two models have the same critical point and the same specic heat. however, the

correlations are dierent, and we proceed to the calculation of the next eigenvalue

of k.

let us introduce the notation

hp|qi  2m 2  2|pq|,

(10)

so k(p, q) = exp (hp|qi). we nd it convenient to think of hp|qi as the inner
product between the loops p and q even though the set of loops is of course not a
linear space. we shall refer to hp|qi as the invariant product on .

if p is a loop we let p denote its complement, i.e. the loop made up of exactly

those links in t2 that p does not contain. we let 0 denote the empty loop and u
the loop that contains all links in the lattice. then 0 = u and p = pu. the
invariant product is clearly symmetric in its two arguments and it has the following

properties:

hp|pi = 2m 2
hp|0i = 2m 2  2|p|
hp| qi = hp|qi.

(11)

(12)

(13)

one can easily construct a nite dimensional inner product space which contains all

loops in a natural fashion such that the inner product of loops coincides with the
invariant product and the loops lie on a sphere of radius 2m.

5

the invariant product is invariant under a nonabelian group g of motions in

loop-space generated by

 the translations of loops

a  t2,

 generalized antipodal maps

ta : p 7 p + a,

aq : p 7 pq,

q  ,

 reections and rotations in t2.

(14)

(15)

invariance means that hgp|gqi = hp|qi for any g  g. as explained above we can
view the set of loops as a sphere and we are free to regard the empty loop as the

north-pole and the complete loop u at the south-pole. loops increase in size as
one moves from north to south. the mapping p 7 p is in this picture the usual
antipodal map and the mappings aq all have the property a2
q = i where i is the

identity map.

the group g acts on the functions in h in a natural way:

g(p ) = (g1p ).

let on denote the linear operator on h with matrix elements

on(p, q) = hp|qin.
then on is invariant under the action of g on h, i.e.

gong1 = on

(16)

(17)

(18)

and the operators on commute with each other. since they are symmetric it follows

that they have common eigenvectors and the same applies of course to the transfer

matrix

on.

(19)

this proves that the eigenvectors of k are independent of .

k =

xn=0

6

in view of the invariance of the transfer matrix under g it is natural to look for

eigenvectors which depend on p only via the invariant product. let us dene

we claim that

q(p ) = hp|qi.

kq = 1()q

for any q  , where

1() =

in order to prove eqs. (21) and (22) it is convenient to introduce a function

(25)

on . if  / q then   pq if and only if   p . similarly, if   q then   pq
if and only if  / p . we conclude that

(pq) = (p )(q).

it follows that

xp

eh0|p i(pq) = xp

eh0|p i(p ) (q)

eh0|p ih0|pi (q).

2m 2 xp

the last equality is obtained by observing that the sum

eh0|p i(p )

xp

7

(26)

(27)

(28)

is independent of  due to the translational and rotational invariance of the invariant

product and using eq. (24). this proves eqs. (21) and (22) since it suces to verify

k(p , p )hp|qi = 1hp |qi

xp

(29)

for p  = 0 due to the invariance of k under g. in fact we have shown that the
functions q, are all eigenfunctions of k with the eigenvalue 1.

we now use the elementary functions q, to construct the higher eigenfunctions

of k. let 1 and 2 be two distinct links. dene

q1q2,12(p ) = q1,1(p )q2,2(p ).

then, by eq. (26),

(kq1q2,12) (0) = 2(1, 2)q1q2,12(0),

i.e. q1q2,12 is an eigenfunction of k with eigenvalue

2(1, 2) = xp

eh0|p i1(p )2(p ).

(30)

(31)

(32)

note that 2(1, 2) depends on the links 1 and 2 but only on their relative orien-

tation and the distance between them. of course the eigenvalue also depends on 

but we suppress this from our notation.

similarly, if the links 1, 2, . . . , n are all distinct, then

q1...qn,1...n(p ) =

qi,i(p )

n

yi=1

is an eigenfunction of k with the eigenvalue

(38)

(39)

for any n > 1 but do not have a general proof of this inequality. it can be checked

in special cases using the explicit form of the two spin correlation function [20] and

the cluster property of correlations.

4 multiplicities

as remarked above, the largest eigenvalue 0 is simple by the perronfrobenius

theorem. let us consider the rst nontrivial eigenvalue 1 with eigenfunctions q,.

since q, is a multiple of 0, by the constant (q) it suces to consider the

functions 0, = . we claim that these functions are linearly independent so the
multiplicity of 1 is at least 2m 2.

suppose there are constants c such that

c (p ) = 0

x

(40)

for any p  . we adopt the convention that sums on  run over all links in t2
unless otherwise specied. then

 xp

c + x /p

c = 0.

by taking p = 0 we also obtain

it follows that

x

xp

c = 0.

c = 0

9

(41)

(42)

(43)

for any p  . let now x and y be two dierent lattice points in t2 and suppose
p is made up of two simple nonintersecting curves 1 and 2 from x to y. then

clearly

x1

c =  x2

c.

(44)

let 3 be one more simple curve from x to y which also avoids 1 and 2. then

we can join 3 with either 1 or 2 to make a closed curve (i.e. a loop) in . we

conclude that

which implies that

x1

c = x3

c = x2

c

c = 0

xi

(45)

(46)

for i = 1, 2, 3. now take x and y to be nearest neighbours and 1 the curve that

joins them by one link 1. it follows that c1 = 0 and hence c = 0 for all  since x

and y are arbitrary.

we could have obtained the above result more easily by noting that the functions
 are mutually orthogonal in the natural inner product on h which we denote by
(  ,  ). this follows from the fact that 12 with 1 6= 2 is an eigenfunction of k
with an eigenvalue 2(1, 2) 6= 0 so 12 is orthogonal to the constant function,
i.e.

hence,

(1, 12) = xp

1(p )2(p ) = 0.

(1, 2) = 12 2m 2

(47)

(48)

since the total number of loops in  is equal to 2m 2

. this can also be seen by a

direct calculation.

if the inequality (39) is valid then the multiplicity of 1 is exactly 2m 2. this
follows from the fact that the functions q1...qn,1...n span h. we now prove this
spanning property.

let 1, 2, 3, 4 be four dierent links which contain the same vertex. we shall

call such a collection of links a star. in this case

1(p )2(p )3(p )4(p ) = 1

(49)

10

for any loop p since p contains 0, 2 or 4 of the links 1, . . . , 4. if 1, 2, 3, 4 are a
star and n  4 it follows that

q1...qn,1...n = q5...qn,5...n.

let l = {1, . . . , n} be a collection of links in t2 and dene

el(p ) = yl

(p ).

(50)

(51)

clearly el = q1...qn,1...n so in order to prove the spanning property it suces to
identify 2m 2
mutually orthogonal functions of the form el. we adopt the convention

e = 1.

if l and l are two collections of links we say that they are equivalent if the
symmetric dierence ll is a star or the symmetric dierence of two or more
stars. this denes an equivalence relation on the set of all collections of links. if l
is a collection of links let [l] denote the equivalence class of l. it is easy to see that
the total number of elements in each equivalence class is 2m 2
and the number of
dierent equivalence classes is also 2m 2
from t2 is 4m 2
then

since the total number of collections of links
. if we choose one li from each equivalence class [li], i = 1, . . . , 2m 2

,

(eli, elj ) = xp ylij

(p ),

(52)

where lij is a maximal subset of lilj which contains no star. hence, for i 6= j,
(53)

(eli, elj ) = (1, elij ) = 0

since lij is nonempty for i 6= j. this proves that {eli} is a family of mutually
orthogonal functions.

5 discussion

using the results derived in the previous section it is quite easy to calculate corre-

lation function, i.e. functions of the form

g(n )



(p, q) = xm =p q

es1(m ),

(54)

where the loops p and q lie in two intermediate constant time planes separated by

n lattice spacings. in eq. (54) we sum over all surfaces whose intersection with the

11

two intermediate planes are p and q and s1(m) is a modied action functional,

counting only edges that are orthogonal to the time direction. we have

g(n )



(p, q) = (p , k n

 q),

(55)

where p and q are delta functions in h. up to normalization we can interpret
g(n )
(p, q) as the probability of having the loop p at time n given that we have q



at time 0. an easy calculation gives

g(n )



(p, q) = 2m 2

2

2m

xi=1

eli(pq)n
li,

(56)

where the sum runs over the orthogonal family of functions constructed in the last

section and li is the eigenvalue of k corresponding to eli.

unfortunately it is not clear how to extend the analysis of the present paper to

include the curvature terms in the action of the full model. the original transfer
matrix (5) is not invariant under the group g, only translations and rotations remain
symmetries. the constant function is not an eigenfunction any more. the only result

that survives is the fact that the largest eigenvalue is in this case also simple by the

perronfrobenius theorem.

however, we have managed to solve exactly a three dimensional lattice model

that describes the diusion of loops. as a surface model it is not isotropic but can

be viewed as a stack of two-dimensional ising systems with an intereaction that is

suciently simple for us to solve the model exactly.
