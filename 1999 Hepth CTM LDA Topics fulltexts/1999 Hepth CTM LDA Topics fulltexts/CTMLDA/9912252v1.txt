abstract

we nd an analytic solution of the bethe ansatz equations (bae) for the special
case of a nite xxz spin chain with free boundary conditions and with a complex
surface eld which provides for uq(sl(2)) symmetry of the hamiltonian. more precisely,
we nd one nontrivial solution, corresponding to the ground state of the system with
anisotropy parameter  = 1

2 corresponding to q3 = 1.

dedicated to rodney baxter
on the occasion of his 60th birhday.

it is widely accepted that the bethe ansatz equations for an integrable quantum spin
chain can be solved analytically only in the thermodynamic limit or for a small number
of spin waves or short chains. in this letter, however, we have managed to nd a special
solution of the bae for a spin chain of arbitrary length n with n/2 spin waves.

it is well known (see, for example [1] and references therein) that there is a correspondence
between the q-state potts models and the ice-type models with anisotropy parameter
q
 =
2 . the coincidence in the spectrum of an n-site self-dual q-state quantum potts
chain with free ends with a part of the spectrum of the uq(sl(2)) symmetrical 2n-site xxz
hamiltonian (1) is to some extent a manifestation of this correspondence.

where  = (q + q1)/2. this hamiltonian was considered by alcaraz et al. [1] and its
uq(sl(2)) symmetry was described by pasqier and saleur [2]. the family of commuting
transfer-matrices that commute with hxxz was constructed by sklyanin [3] incorporating a
method of cherednik [4].

baxters t-q equation for the case under consideration can be written as [5]

t(u)q(u) = (u + /2)q(u  ) + (u  /2)q(u + )

(2)

where q = exp i, (u) = sin 2u sin2n u and t(u) = sin 2u t (u). the q(u) are eigenvalues of
baxters auxilary matrix q(u), where q(u) commutes with the transfer matrix t (u). the
eigenvalue q(u) corresponding to an eigenvector with m = n/2  sz reversed spins has the
form

m

equation (2) is equivalent to the bethe ansatz equations [6]

q(u) =

sin(u  um) sin(u + um).

in a recent article [9] it was argued that the criteria for the above mentioned correspon-
dence is the existence of a second trigonometric solution for baxters t-q equation and it
was shown that in the case  = /4 the spectrum of hxxz contains the spectrum of the ising
model. in this article we limit ourselves to the case  = /3. this case is in some sense triv-
ial since for this value of , hxxz corresponds to the 1-state potts model. we nd only one
eigenvalue t0(u) of the transfer-matrices t (u) when baxters equation (2) has two indepen-
dent trigonometric solutions. solving for t (u) = t0(u) analytically we nd a trigonometric
polynomial q0(u) the zeros of which satisfy the bethe ansatz equations (4). the number of
spin waves is equal to m = n/2. the corresponding eigenstate is the groundstate of hxxz
with eigenvalue e0 = 3

2(1  n), as discovered by alcaraz et al. [1] numerically.

when does a second independent periodic solution exist? this question was considered

in article [9]. here we use a variation more convenient for our goal.

let us consider t-q equation (2) for  = 

l , where l  3 is an integer. let us x a
sequence of spectral parameter values vk = v0 + k, where k are integers and write k =
(vk  /2), qk = q(vk) and tk = t(vk). the functions (u), q(u) and t(u) are periodic
with period . so the sequences we have introduced are also periodic with period l, i.e.,
k+l = k, etc..

setting u = vk in (2) gives the linear system

tkqk = k+1qk1 + kqk+1.

(5)

the matrix of coecients for this system has a tridiagonal form. taking v0 6= m
is an integer, we have k 6= 0 for all k.

2 , where m

it is straightforward to calculate the determinant of the l  2  l  2 minor obtained
by deleting the two left most columns and two lower most rows. it is equal to the product
2
123 . . . l1, which is nonzero, hence the rank of m cannot be less than l  2. here

2

we are interested in the case when the rank of m is precisely l  2 and we have two linearly
independent solutions for equation (5). let us consider the three simplest cases l = 3, 4
and 5. the parameter  is equal to 

3 , 

4 and 

5 respectively.

for l = 3 the rank of m is unity and we immediately get t0 = 2, t1 = 0 and

t2 = 1. returning to the functional form, we can write

t0(u) = t0(u)/ sin 2u = (u + /2)/ sin 2u = cos2n u.

(6)

this is the unique eigenvalue of the transfer-matrix for which the t-q equation has two
independent periodic solutions. it is well known (see, for example, [6]) that the eigenvalues
of hxxz are related to the eigenvalues t(u) by

e =  cos (n + 2  tan2 ) + sin 

t(/2)
t(/2)

.

(7)

for the eigenstate corresponding to eigenvalue (6) we obtain e0 = 3/2(1  n). this is the
groundstate energy which was discovered by alcaraz et al. [1] numerically.

below we nd all solutions of baxters t-q equation corresponding to t (u) = t0(u).
zeros of these solutions satisfy the bae (4). in particular we nd q0(x) corresponding to
physical bethe state.

for l = 4, deleting the second row and the forth column of m we obtain a minor with
2 ) = t(u). considering

determinant 03(t0 + t2). it is zero when t2 = t0, i.e., t(u + 
the other minors we obtain the functional equation

t(u + /8)t(u  /8) = (u + /4)(u  /4)  (u)(u + /2).

(8)

this functional equation was used in [9] to nd t(u) and show that this part of the spectrum
of hxxz coincides with the ising model. it would be interesting to nd a corresponding q(u).
lastly for l = 5, minor m35 (the third row and the fth column are deleted) has deter-

minant 04(t0t1 + 1t3  02). setting this to zero we have

t(u)t(u + /5) + (u + /10)t(u + 3/5)  (u  /10)(u + 3/10) = 0.

(9)

it is not dicult to check that in this case all 44 minors have zero determinant and that the
rank of m is 3. thus we have two independent periodic solutions of baxters t-q equation.
note that this functional relation coincides with the baxter-pearce relation for the hard
hexagon model [10]. we have obtained the same truncated functional relations that have
been obtained in [9] with the same assumptions.

we now consider the solution of baxters equation for  = 

3 and t = t0. for  = 

3 and

transfer-matrix eigenvalue t0(u) = cos2n u, the t-q equation (2) reduces to

(u + 3/2)q(u) + (u  /2)q(u + ) + (u + /2)q(u  ) = 0.

(10)

this equation can be rewritten as

f (v) + f (v + 2/3) + f (v + 4/3) = 0,

(11)

3

where f (v) = sin v cos2n (v/2) q(v/2) has period 2. the trigonometric polynomial f (v) is
an odd function, so it can be written

f (v) =

k

xk=1

ck sin kv,

where k is the degree of f (v). then equation (11) is equivalent to c3m = 0, m  z.

the condition that f (v) be divisible by sin v cos2n (v/2) is equivalent to

(

d
dv

)if (v)|v= = 0,

i = 0, 1, . . . , 2n.

for even i this condition is immediate, whereas for i = 2j  1 we use (12) to obtain

k

(1)kckk2j1 = 0,

xk=1,k6=3m

j = 1, 2, . . . , n.

(12)

(13)

(14)

our problem is thus to nd {ck} satisfying the last equation. this problem is a special
case of a more general problem which can be formulated as follows. given a set of dierent
complex numbers x = {x1, x2, . . . , xi} we seek another complex set b = {1, 2, . . . , i}
where i 6= 0 for some i, so that

ip (xi) = 0

i

xi=1

(15)

for any polynomial p (x) of degree not more than n  1. it is clear that for i  n the
system b does not exist. if 1 6= 0, for example, the product (x  x2)(x  x3) . . . (x  xi)
provides a counterexample.

let i = n + 1. we try the polynomials

n

pr =

(x  xi),

yi=1,i6=r,

r = 1, 2, . . . , n.

condition (15) gives rpr(xr) + ipr(xi ) = 0 and we immediately obtain

r = const

n +1

yi=1,i6=r

(xr  xi)1,

(16)

(17)

which is a solution because the system (16) forms a basis of the linear space of n  1 degree
polynomials. so for i = n + 1 we have a unique solution (up to an arbitrary nonzero
constant) given by (17). it is easy to show that for i = n +  we obtain a -dimensional
linear space of solutions.

returning to (14) we consider n = 2n, n a positive integer. fix i = n + 1 = 2n + 1.
the degree k becomes 3n + 1. it is convenient to use a new index k = |3 + 1| , where
||  n. equation (14) can be rewritten as

(3 + 1)2(j1) = 0,

j = 1, 2, . . . , n,

(18)

n

x=n

4

where we use new unknowns  = (1)c|3+1||3 + 1| instead of ck. using (17) and (12) we
obtain the function f (v)

f (v) =

n

x=n

(1)(cid:18) 2n + 2

n   (cid:19)(cid:18) 2n  2

n +  (cid:19) sin(3 + 1)v.

we recall that the solution of baxters t-q equation for t (u) = t0(u) is given by

q0(u) = f (2u)/(sin 2u cos2n u)

(19)

(20)

and its zeros {uk} satisfy the bae (4).

another way to derive the above solution is to observe that the function f (v) satises a
simple second order linear dierential equation. indeed, it is easily seen that the functions
f +(x) and f (x), where

f +(x) =

(1)(cid:18) 2n + 2

n   (cid:19)(cid:18) 2n  2

n +  (cid:19)x+ 1

3

n

x=n

3 and f (x) = f +(1/x).

are the two linearly independent solutions of the dierential equation

{(( + n)2  1/9)/x + (  n)2  1/9}f + = 0,

(21)

(22)

dx .1 now the fact that there is a combination f (v) of f +(e3iv) and f (e3iv)
where  = x d
which vanishes to order 2n + 1 at v =  follows immediately from the fact that x = 1 is
a singular point of the dierential equation (22) and that the indicial equation at this point
has roots 0 and 2n + 1. in terms of the variable v, equation (22) becomes

d2f
dv2 + 6n tan(3v/2)

df
dv

+ (1  9n2) f = 0.

(23)

the zeros of f (v), the density of which is important in the thermodynamic limit, are
located on the imaginary axis in the complex v-plane. so it is convenient to make the change
of variable v = is. it is also useful to introduce another function g(s) = f (is)/ cosh2n(3s/2).
the dierential equation for g(s) is then

g +  9n(2n + 1)

2 cosh2(3s/2)

 1! g = 0.

(24)

let g(s0) = 0. for large n we have in a small vicinity of s0 an approximate equation g+2
0g =
0. this equation describes a harmonic oscillator with frequency 0 = 3n/ cosh(3s0/2). the
distance between nearest zeros is approximately s = / and we obtain the following
density function which describes the number of zeros per unit length

(s) = 1/s = / = 3n/( cosh(3s/2)).

(25)

1up to a change of variables this is just the standard hypergeometric dierential equation, and in fact

f +(x) = const f (2n, 2/3  2n, 5/3, x)x1/3n

we note that equation (24) has a history as rich as the bae. eckart [11] used the
schrodinger equation with bell-shaped potential v (r) = g/ cosh2 r for phenomenological
studies in atomic and molecular physics. later it was used in chemistry, biophysics and
astrophysics, just to name a few. for more recent references see, for example, [12].
