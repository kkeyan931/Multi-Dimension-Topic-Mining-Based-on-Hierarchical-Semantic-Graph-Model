abstract

an eective supergravity description of all instabilities of n4 = 4 super-
strings is derived. the construction is based on the n4 = 4 bps mass
formula at nite temperature and uses the properties of n4 = 4 gauged
supergravity. it provides the boundaries of the various thermal phases in
the non-perturbative moduli space. it also draws a precise picture of the
dynamics in the high-temperature heterotic phase. this brief contribu-
tion summarizes results obtained in collaboration with i. antoniadis and
c. kounnas.

string theories (at weak coupling) generically exhibit high-temperature instabilities
due to a density of states growing exponentially with the energy. at the hagedorn
temperature [1], a winding state becomes tachyonic and the string theory enters a new
phase with a non-zero value of this state. the existence of the hagedorn temperature
can be established by studying the mass formula, derived from the modular invariant
partition function at nite temperature [2]. finite temperature is formally equivalent
to a compactication of (euclidean) time on a circle with radius (2t )1. bound-
ary conditions depending on statistics break supersymmetry and, because of modular
invariance, modify gso projections.

to obtain information on the phases in the vicinity of a hagedorn transition, one
approach is to construct an eective eld theory for the light and tachyonic states. in
[3], this problem has been solved for n4 = 4 strings1. a n4 = 4 supergravity
ref.
is dened by a parametrization of its scalar manifold and a choice of the gauging
applied to the vector elds present in the yang-mills and supergravity multiplets. the
gaugings related to, for instance, torus-compactied heterotic strings [4] or scherk-
schwarz supersymmetry breaking [5] are known. the knowledge of the specic gauging
corresponding to nite temperature allowed the construction of eective supergravity
lagrangians for the temperature instabilities of perturbative heterotic and type ii
strings and the study of the high-temperature phases [3].

in ve dimensions, heterotic strings on t 4  s 1, iia and iib strings on k3  s 1 are
related by s- and t -dualities. a non-perturbative extension of the perturbative descrip-
tion of strings at nite temperature with a universal (duality-invariant) temperature
modulus should then display an interesting structure of thermal phases. these theo-
ries are eectively four-dimensional at nite temperature and an eective lagrangian
description of the thermal phases would be a four-dimensional supergravity. this con-
struction has been performed in ref. [6]2, and the present contribution is a summary
of this work.

our procedure is rstly to write the nite-temperature generalization of the n4 = 4
non-perturbative bps mass formula, taking into account the expected dualities and the
various perturbative heterotic, iia and iib limits. secondly, an eective supergravity
is constructed by identifying the appropriate eld content (potentially tachyonic states
and the minimal set of necessary moduli), the parametrization of the scalar manifold
and, most importantly, the gauging for n4 = 4 bps states at nite temperature. notice
that our analysis will be restricted to bps states breaking half of the supersymmetries.
in terms of the (heterotic) string coupling gh and the t 2 torus radii r and r6, the

supersymmetric bps mass formula is [8]:

the mass formula (2) possesses the same duality properties as the zero-temperature
expression (1) and r, the inverse temperature, is a duality-invariant quantity. eq.
(2) gives the states and critical values of the temperature radius at which a tachyon
appears. each corresponds to the hagedorn transition of a perturbative string, either
heterotic, or iia or iib. it also contains new information (on critical values of h
and/or r6) since it also decides which tachyon arises rst when t  1/r increases.
we now want to construct an eective (four-dimensional) supergravity for the ve-
dimensional strings at nite temperature. to describe instabilities, we may truncate
the n4 = 4 spectrum and retain only the necessary moduli and potentially tachyonic
states, as indicated by mass formula (2). the resulting truncated theory will have
n4 = 1 supersymmetry3 and include chiral multiplets only.

the scalar manifold of a generic, unbroken, n4 = 4 theory is [9, 10]

  sl(2, r)

u(1) !s  g/h,

g/h =  

so(6, r + n)

so(6)  so(r + n)!ti ,a

.

(4)

the manifold g/h of the vector multiplets splits into a part that includes the 6r
moduli ti, and a second part with the innite number n   of bps states. we need
to keep three moduli s, t and u (for the temperature radius r, the torus radius r6
and the string coupling) and three pairs of winding states z 
a , a = 1, 2, 3, to generate

3 the four gravitinos are treated identically by nite temperature eects.

the instabilities, as indicated by mass formula (2). thus, r = 2 and n = 6 in eq. (4).
the truncation from n4 = 4 to n4 = 1 proceeds then as for the untwisted sector of a
z2  z2 orbifold. the rst z2 leaves n4 = 2 unbroken and the manifold is
so(4)  so(6)!a

u(1) !t  sl(2, r)

u(1) !s   sl(2, r)

u(1) !u  

 sl(2, r)

so(4, 6)

.

the rst three factors are vector multiplets (s, t , u), the last one a hypermultiplet
component (z 
a ). the second z2 truncation cuts the hypermultiplet component in two
kahler manifolds:

 

so(2, 3)

so(2)  so(3)!z +

a

 

so(2, 3)

so(2)  so(3)!z

.

the structure of the truncated scalar manifold and the poincare n4 = 4 constraints on
the scalar elds [10] indicate that the kahler potential can be written as [3, 5]

a , z +

a , z 

a ) = 1  2z 

k =  log(s +s)log(t +t )log(u +u )log y (z +
with y (z 
b ). this kahler function can be de-
termined for instance by comparing the gravitino mass terms in the n4 = 1 lagrangian
and in the z2  z2 truncation of n4 = 4 supergravity.
the last piece to dene the eective supergravity is the superpotential. finding the
correct gauging of n4 = 4 supergravity for mass formula (2) requires some guesswork.

eqs. (5) and (6) dene an eective supergravity which includes in its solutions the
thermal phases of ve-dimensional n4 = 4 heterotic, type iia and type iib strings,
and respects all expected duality symmetries.

the scalar potential is complicated but a closed expression can be worked out4. it
is stationary at z 
a = 0 (zero winding background value). at this point, masses follow
the formula (2), as they should. this solution corresponds to the low-temperature
phase. tachyons only arise in directions re(z +
a )  za, and truncating further to
these directions leads to a very simple potential:

in these expressions, ha = za/(1  zbzb), s = re s, t = re t , u = re u, heterotic
temperature duality is tu  (tu)1 and iiaiib duality is t, h2  u, h3.
limited space permits us to only briey review the analysis of the eective theory.

1) in four-dimensional planck units, the temperature is duality-invariant:

t = (2r)1,

r2 = 2stu.

(8)

2) the low-temperature phase, with zero background values of the winding states z 
a ,
is universal to the three strings. it is in some sense a self-dual phase, as can be seen
for instance in the pattern of supersymmetry breaking. since

(gs

s )1/2 gs = (gt

t )1/2 gt = (gu

u )1/2 gu = 1

(9)

(other derivatives of g = k + log |w|2 vanish), the canonically normalized goldstino
is the sum of the fermionic partners of s, t and u. and the gravitino mass is

this phase certainly exists in the perturbative regime of each string.

3) the boundaries of the low-temperature phase are the values of s, t, and u at which
a winding state becomes tachyonic:

4) type ii instabilities arise when su < 4 (iia) or st < 4 (iib). from the heterotic
point of view, they are avoided as long as

only type ii thermal instabilities exist in this heterotic strong-coupling regime and
h decides whether the type iia or iib instability will have the
lowest critical temperature. if on the contrary the heterotic string is weakly coupled,
gh < gcrit., the high-temperature heterotic phase is reached for values of the radius r6
verifying

the large and small r6 limits, with xed gh, again lead to type iia or iib instabilities.

supergravity is solved by a background with a dilaton linear in a space-like direction.
the fate of supersymmetry is interesting.
inequality (15) indicates that the high-t
heterotic phase only exists for weakly-coupled heterotic strings, and by duality in non-
perturbative type ii regimes. accordingly, supersymmetry breaking arises from s: only
gs is non-zero. it turns out, as observed in ref. [3], that the spectrum of moduli and
heterotic perturbative winding modes z 
is supersymmetric6. but this degeneracy
does not exist for heterotic dyonic modes z

the signicance of this mass pattern is somewhat ambiguous. the residual space-time
symmetry with a linear dilaton is three-dimensional and local supersymmetry does not
imply mass degeneracy in this dimension [11]. this mass pattern however survives in
ve-dimensional type iia and iib limits, indicating then broken supersymmetry.
7) the linear dilaton background leads to a central charge decit7 c = 4. it can be
described by a non-critical string with the corresponding central charge. the appro-
priate string background is a non-compact parafermionic space, in which degeneracy

of perturbative bosonic and fermionic uctuations is ensured by n4 = 2 (or n3 = 4)
supersymmetry. this agrees with the space-time solution with linear dilaton: the
background is left invariant by the half of the supercharges in the n4 = 4 algebra.
