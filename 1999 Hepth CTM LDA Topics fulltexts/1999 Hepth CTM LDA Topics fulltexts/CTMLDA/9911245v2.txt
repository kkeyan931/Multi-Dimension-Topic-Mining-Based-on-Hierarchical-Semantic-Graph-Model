abstract

we derive a bps-type bound for four-dimensional born-infeld action with constant b
eld background. the supersymmetric conguration saturates this bound and is regarded
as an analog of instanton in u(1) gauge theory. furthermore, we nd the explicit solutions
of this bps condition. these solutions have a nite action proportional to the instanton
number and represent d(p4)-branes within a dp-brane although they have a singularity
at the origin. some relations to the noncommutative u(1) instanton are discussed.

in recent development of string theory, it has been realized that noncommutative

spacetime is naturally appeared in the d-brane physics. indeed, it has been known that

in a certain limit the transverse coordinates of d-branes can be regarded as matrices. this

fact implies the non-commutativity of spacetime [1]. furthermore the noncommutative

yang-mills theory is realized on the world volume of d-branes with constant b eld

background. this has been shown in the context of matrix theory in [2] and more directly

considering open strings ending on the d-branes in [3, 4, 5].

in [11], seiberg and witten has promoted this idea deeper and argued that the non-

commutative yang-mills theory is equivalent to the ordinary gauge theory. they have

also discussed the relations between the ordinary instantons and the instantons in the

noncommutative yang-mills theory [6, 7] which has no small instanton singularities. 
the instantons represent the d(p  4)-branes within the dp-brane.

in the u(1) case, the eective action on the brane for the slowly varying elds has

been known as the dirac-born-infeld action [12]. it has been shown in [11] that the bps

condition of the ordinary dirac-born-infeld action and a noncommutative one are equiv-
alent in a limit   0 with an appropriate rescaling of the metric. the noncommutative
u(1) gauge theory has instanton solutions [6] though the ordinary u(1) gauge theory can

not has a nonsingular solutions with nonzero instanton numbers. in the limit, they have

also constructed the bps solutions with a nite instanton number and a singularity at

the origin.

in this paper we consider the bps condition of the ordinary dirac-born-infeld action

with  xed nite. we derive the bps-type bound for the born-infeld action with

constant b eld background and show that the supersymmetric conguration indeed

saturates this bound. moreover we nd the solutions of this bps condition. these
solutions have a nite action proportional to the integral of f  f and may represent
d(p  4)-branes in a dp-brane though they have a singularity at the origin. although
these solution can not be valid because of the singularity, we expect that the solutions is

approximately valid away from the singularity. thus the u(1) instanton solutions maybe

teach us the relations between the two theories.

the noncommutative instanton on the torus has been discussed in [8]. the monopole in the non-

commutative yang-mills theory has been considered in [9, 10]

1

let us consider the four-dimensional bosonic born-infeld lagrangian,

s = t z dx4qdet (g + 2(f + b)),

where t is a constant [12] and parameterize the metric as

gij = 2 ij.

(1)

(2)

first we discuss a bps-type bound for the born-infeld action with constant b+ and

b = 0. here we concentrate on the gauge eld conguration with

ij = f (x)b+
f +
ij ,

(3)

for simplicity. this can be achieved by taking the gauge potential to the form considered

in [11],

ai = bijxjh(r),

(4)

and in [11] it has been stated that this is the most general u(2)-invariant ansatz where
the u(2) is a subgroup of so(4) that leaves b+ xed.

dening b2 = (b+)2/4 and

d0 = 2 + b2  pff,
d1 = f + 1

d2 = f +

pff
2 + b2 = d1 

1

2 + b2 d0,

(5)

(6)

(7)

we can show that

det(cid:20) 1

2 g + (f + b+)(cid:21) = 4 +

2(f + b)2 + (pf(f + b))2

= 4 + 22nb2pff + 2f (f + 1)b2o+(cid:16)b2 pff  2b2(f + 1)(cid:17)2

0 + 4b2(2 + b2)d1d2

= d2
= (d0 + 2b2d2)2 + 4b22(d2)2  (d0 + 2b2d2)2,

(8)

where we have used f 2 = fijfij = (f +)2 + (f )2 and 4pff = f f = ((f +)2  (f )2).
therefore using s|f =0 = (2)2 t (2 + b2), we obtain an inequality
s  s|f =0  (2)2 t z dx4 (pff + 2b2d2).

(9)

2

here we simply have assumed that d0+2b2d2  0. the inequality (9) is a generalization of
the bps-type bound for dbi action with b = 0 [14] to the nonzero b eld. this bps-type

bound is saturated by the conguration which satises the nonlinear equation d2 = 0.

later we will see that this equation is also a bps condition to preserve supersymmetry
if we consider the supersymmetric extension of s. note that d0 + 2b2d2 is a constant

plus a total derivative and depends only on the boundary value of the gauge eld because
f = f +

ij /b+
ij .

now we consider the four-dimensional dirac-born-infeld action which is an n = 4
supersymmetric eective action for a d-brane if we ignore o(f ) terms. we can obtain
s by setting all scalars and fermions to zero.

below we will restrict our attention to the minimal n = 1 supersymmetric extension

of bosonic born-infeld action considered in [13], which is a part of the dirac-born-infeld

action since we expect that the other elds in full dirac-born-infeld action do not aect

the analysis performed in this paper.

it is known that there are two distinct supertransformations for this action [13]. one

is a liner supertransformation given by

 = (f +
  = (f 

ij + b+

ij + b

 ,

ij )ij 

ij )ij

  ,

(10)

where  is a parameter of the transformation. the other one is nonlinear and broken if

constant part of f + b vanishes. this is given by [13] [11],

for f = 0 and a constant b, it can be shown that a combination of  +  with

(13)

below we will search the bps solution for the action with a constant b+ 6= 0 and

b = 0. then eq.(12) becomes

b+

22 ij 
and the bps condition ( + ) = 0 is equivalent to

as a direct consequence of this, f + should be proportional to b+ and we set

then eq.(15) becomes

ij = f (x)b+
f +
ij .

(14)

(15)

(16)

22(f + 1) {2  b2  2f b2  pff} = q{2  b2  2f b2  pff}2 + 42(f + 1)2b2. (17)

because the lhs of this equation is positive, we have solutions only if

22(f + 1)  {2  b2  2f b2  pff} = 2f (2 + b2) + 2 + b2 + pff  0,

(18)

is satised. then the eq.(17) is equivalent to

0 = 4b2(f + 1){(f + 1)(2  b2) +(cid:16)2 + b2 + 2f b2 + pff(cid:17)}

= 4b2(2 + b2)d1d2.

(19)

therefore there are two types of solutions of bps condition. the rst one is d1 = 0 with
d0  0. the second one is

d2 = f +

pff
2 + b2 = 0,

(20)

with

d0  0.

to proceed further, we assume that the solution of (15) has the gauge eld of the form

(4). we move to a ame where

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

hence the solutions of the rst condition 0 = d1 = (4h+rh2)/2 are h = 1/2+e/r4
where e is some constant. however, evaluating d0 = 2 + e2/r8  0, we nd that this
solution can not be accepted unless  = e = 0.

to obtain solutions with f decaying suciently rapidly for large r, we now solve the

second condition (20)

0 = f +

(26)

note that the gauge potential and the eld strength have a singularity at r = 0 and n does

not have to be quantized in this analysis. later we will shortly discuss these problems.

we also note that if this solution satises the condition (21), it is also a solution of the
equation of motion of bosonic born-infeld action with a constant f + background except

at the origin.

to show that this solution satises (21), remember the formula

pff = b2 1

(r4h2).

(30)

(31)

from this, we conclude d0  0 for the solution satisfying (28). according to (28), however,
b2(cid:17)2
the gauge potential has a nonzero imaginary part if n < 0 and (cid:16)1 + 2
b2 r4 . thus

we conclude that the solution (4) with (28) is consistent if and only if n > 0.

< 32n

we can see that the instanton number is n from the computation

although the solution has the singularity at r = 0, its action is nite and proportional

to the instanton number. this follows from the bps-type bound (9) and d2 = 0. indeed

we obtain

s  s|f =0 = t z dx4 (cid:26)qdet (g + 2(f + b)) qdet (g + 2(b))(cid:27)

= t (2)242n.

(33)

if we consider a dp-brane, t becomes its tension and the instantons represents d(p  4)-
branes within it [15, 16]. in this case, the eective lagrangian contains a chern-simons

term

lcs =

1

2(2)2 zdp

cp3  f  f,

(34)

where cp3 is a rr (p  3)-form. in the instanton background, this induces a coupling
(35)

cp3,

lcs = n zd(p4)

which implies that n is the number of the d(p  4)-branes. since the tension of a dp-
brane is tp = 1/(gs(2)p() p+1
2 ), the action of the instantons within the brane is given
by

s  s|f =0 =

gs(2)p4() p3

2

n

,

(36)

and agrees with the tension of the d(p  4)-brane.

here we should require n to be an integer number. it is possible that this quantization
of n is required if we include the o(f ) terms into the action. however even if this is
indeed so and considering the r  rc region, n dened in (28) can be corrected to become
a non-integer number by inclusion of these terms.

now we study the solutions in various limits. first in the r  rc region, the solution

becomes

h  

2 + b2

r (cid:19)4
8b2 (cid:18)rc

and in the r  rc region it becomes

h  

2 + b2

r (cid:19)2
8b2 (cid:18)rc

,

.

(37)

(38)

the zero slope limit of [11],   

2 , gij = ij with   0, corresponds to   0. in
this limit the corresponding action of the noncommutative theory becomes the f 2 action

1

7

and the bps condition becomes f + = 0. this condition has been matched with eq. (15)
in the limit. the solutions (28) agree with the solutions obtained in [11] in the   0
limit.

if we take b  0 limit, the instantons are expected to be very small to be able to
escape from the dp-brane, as the small instanton singularity in the world volume non-
abelian gauge theory of dp-branes. indeed, we can easily show that in the b  0 limit,
r2
c  b/2 and f  b
r4 in the region r  rc. thus in this limit the instantons are
localized in the very small region with the length scale rc( 
b )s with 1/4 < s < 1/2 and the
singularity becomes worse. the usual   0 limit corresponds to   . in this limit
also, the instantons become small instantons.

2

1

we expect that in the region r  rc the solutions obtained in this paper is valid because
f is very small. however, since the solutions vary too rapidly near the origin, the eects
of the o(f ) terms can not be neglected. the solutions may become nonsingular due to
the correction from these terms and correspond to the nonsingular noncommutative u(1)

instantons.

finally we represent the natural parameters g and  in the noncommutative gauge

theory by the ones in ordinary gauge theory. denoting gij = 2ij and

 = (2)2(g + 2b)1b(g  2b)1 =

(39)

(40)

(41)

we note that r2

c is roughly identied with the scale of noncommutativity t.

in conclusion we have derived the bps-type bound for four-dimensional born-infeld

action with constant b eld background. the supersymmetric u(1) instanton congu-

ration saturates this bound. we have found the explicit solutions of this bps condition.

although this solution has a singularity at the origin, but this has a nite action which

is consistent with the interpretation of this as d(p-4) branes within dp-branes. some

8

relations to the noncommutative u(1) instanton has been discussed. to further explore

the connection between two theories it will be interesting to investigate the bps solution

of the world volume theory of the multiple dp-branes with constant b eld because in

this case the usual non-abelian instanton is not singular.
