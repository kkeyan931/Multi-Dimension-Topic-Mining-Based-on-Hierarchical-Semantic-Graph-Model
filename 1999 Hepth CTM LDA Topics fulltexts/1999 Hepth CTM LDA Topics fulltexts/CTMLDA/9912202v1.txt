abstract

it is shown how w -algebras emerge from very peculiar canonical transformations with
respect to the canonical symplectic structure on a compact riemann surface. the action of
smooth dieomorphisms of the cotangent bundle on suitable generating functions is written in
the brs framework while a w -symmetry is exhibited. subsequently, the complex structure
of the symmetry spaces is studied and the related brs properties are discussed. the specic
example of the so-called w3-algebra is treated in relation to some other dierent approaches.

1 introduction

in the last decade, a large body of literature has been devoted to the study of the so-
called w -algebras. the latter were rst introduced as higher spin extension of the virasoro
algebra, [1, 2], through the operator product expansion (ope) of the stress-energy tensor and
primary elds in two dimensional conformal field theory (cft). whenever the ope of some
(primary) elds is needed for dynamical analysis, the associated cft provides the computational
artillery and selects the monomials of the expansion. since a way of extending the bidimensional
conformal symmetry yields the notion of w -algebras, in this context cft arises as a perturbative
groundstate around which one expands the theory. w -algebras have been widely occurred in two
dimensional physics, such as the 2d anisotropic oscillator, coulombian and generalized hartmann
potentials, gravitation (w -gravity), condensed matter (quantum hall eect), integrable models
(kdv, toda), phase transitions in two dimensions, intermediate statistics, solitary waves since
the intrinsic intertwining between internal and space time symmetries realized in these algebra
provide an amazing landscape to discuss dynamics in a physical context. the interested reader
is referred to some review papers such as [3, 4, 5, 6], and many others which have been implicitly
quoted for the sake of brevity.

however, it turns out that the ope mechanism is not the most natural way to get an
algebra.
indeed, the discovery of composition laws in products between quantum elds at
coincident points, when inserted in green functions of complete set of states, do not allow to
dene an algebra. beyond them, further mathematical properties have to be imposed, so that
a lot of mathematical verications, spread in the literature, have to be performed. anyhow the
role played by cft in all the basic aspects of w -algebras is crucial for these reasons and their
mathematical aspects and geometrical origin are important questions [7].

furthermore, the distinctive feature of the (local) conformal symmetry in two dimensions is
that it provides an innite number of conservation laws. it turns out that this innite symmetry
has several consequences as was rst shown in [8]; a conformal symmetry is a (local) dieomor-
phism (i.e. a locally smooth and invertible map) which acts on the hilbert space of the theory
as a symmetry.

for all these above reasons one can ask whether a more canonical approach, such as the
ones leading to noether theorem in lagrangian field theory, or canonical transformations, may
provide the construction of a certain type of w -algebras. indeed, if we can nd some kind of
space-time transformations (due to the local character of these algebras) where all the formal

2

requirements (associativity, existence of inverse and so on) are fullled, then the usual calculation
artillery of field theory allows a realization of these algebras. in doing so, a larger insight in
the intrinsic nature of this symmetry could be achieved.

already witten [9] has suggested that these algebras could have a space-time origin as
symplectic dieomorphisms, and hull [10] gave some examples in terms of dieomorphisms
acting on elds (the so-called w -matter).

in this paper we shall construct some of these w -algebras from only coordinate symmetries
on the cotangent bundle. in particular, we shall derive generating functions for a very restrictive
class of canonical transformations whose reduction will provide in general an innite chain of
smooth changes of coordinates from a background and to new coordinate frames.

in mathemathical terms, we shall study a realisation of the algebra of dieomorphisms on
the cotangent bundle over a world-sheet , di0(t ), which extends the w -algebra. a par-
ticular attention will be devoted to the complex structure mappings induced by these canonical
transformations.

in section 2 we shall describe the geometrical approach which will lead to b.r.s transfor-

mations as they will be given in section 3.

the general reduction to w -symmetry will be described in section 4 and in particular the w
symmetry will be derived. a particular attention will be paid on the role of complex structure of
each two dimensional graded space whose dieomorphism algebra will generate the wn algebras.
in particular the generalization of the beltrami dierential parameters will also be discussed.
our approach will be complementary to those given in [11, 12, 13].

in order to illustrate the construction, we shall discuss in section 5 the w3 case. two
dierent dieomorphism symmetries will give rise to two kinds of w3-algebras respectively.
firstly, a geometrical meaning will be given for the w3-algebra already discussed by sorella et
al [14] and found through the ope mechanism by many authors [15]. secondly, it will be shown
how the w3 algebra given by grimm et al [17], and ader and coworkers [18], [19] arises from
the construction.

2 the geometrical approach

given a smooth compact 2d-surface , we shall right away choose a prescribed local complex
analytic coordinates (z, z). on the smooth cotangent bundle t , we will use throughout the

3

paper local adapted complex coordinates (z, z; yz, yz), with bre coordinates (yz, yz) [20] for the
natural coframe associated to the holonomic coordinates (z, z). the former will be shorthandly
denoted by (z, y). the canonical 1-form,  on t  then locally writes in the local chart u(z,y)
of t ,

the fundamental 2-form,   d, reads in local adapted coordinates on t ,

|u(z,y)

= yzdz + yzdz.

and is closed. by stokes theorem, one also has

|u(z,y)

 dyz  dz + dyz  dz,

z

 = z

,

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

which vanishes if  is without boundary.

let us now consider a smooth change of local coordinates on t , (z, z; yz , y z), or (z, y )

for short. the canonical form then locally reads,

and the corresponding fundamental 2-form,

|u(z,y )

= yz dz + y z dz,

|u(z,y )

= d = dyz  dz + dy z  dz.

(2.4)

(2.5)

this smooth change of local coordinates on t  turns out to be a canonical transformation if
the fundamental 2-form remains invariant, which means that, on u(z,y)  u(z,y ),

|u(z,y)

= |u(z,y )

,

(2.6)

this condition selects particular coordinate transformation laws which are usually called canon-
ical transformations [21]. eq.(2.6) implies that on u(z,y)  u(z,y ),

|u(z,y)

 |u(z,y )

= df,

(2.7)

where f is a generating function in the base coordinates (z, z, z, z) on u(z,y)  u(z,y ) which
is dieomorphic to r2 r2 and  is the projection on . it will be however more convenient

4

to use the local coordinates (z, y ) by introducing the generating function (z, y ) through a
legendre transformation of f ,

d(z, y )  d(cid:18)f (z, z) + yz z + y z z(cid:19) = yzdz + yzdz + dyz z + dy zz.

(2.8)

the function (z, y ) is the generating function of the canonical transformation (z, y) 
(z, y ). it is locally dened (up to a total derivative) in the independent coordinates (z, y ) of

the smooth trivial bundle   r2 and has a non-singular hessian, ||
total dierential is

2
zy

|| 6= 0. on   r2 the

d = dzz + dzz + dyz



yz

+ dy z



y z

 dz + dyz ,

(2.9)

and d2 = 0 yields d2

z = d2
yz

= dzdyz + dyz dz = 0, or in local coordinates,
(cid:20)z,

yz(cid:21) = 0,

(cid:20)z,





yz(cid:21) = 0,

(2.10)

with the complex conjugate expressions. since d2 = 0 we get the important identities,

yz = yz,



y z

z =



yz

z,



yz

yz = z,



y z

yz = z,

(2.11)

(and their c.c.). the generating function  induces the following canonical transformation
dened by,

(z, z) = (z, z),

yz(z, y ) = (z, y ),

z(z, y ) =



yz

(z, y ),

(yz , y z ) = (yz , y z),

(2.12)

(2.13)

with also the complex conjugate coordinates.
in account of this choice of generating func-
tion, ((z, z); yz, yz) becomes a family of local smooth sections of the cotangent bundle t 
parametrized by y and over u(z,y)  u(z,y ).

as is well known, by the implicit function theorem, eq.(2.12) is locally solved in y (z, y) and

plugging into eq.(2.13) one ends with

z(z, y) = (cid:18) 

yz

(z, y )(cid:19) |y =y (z,y).

(2.14)

 from now on, we shall reserve s for   z,   z.

5

one also checks that

|u(z,y)

= dz(z, y )|y =y (z,y),

(2.15)

where the 1-form, dz(z, y ), on   r2, is evaluated on a solution y (z, y) of eq.(2.12). accord-
ingly, the fundamental 2-form simply reads,

|u(z,y)

= d|u(z,y)

= dy(cid:18)dz(z, y )|y =y (z,y)(cid:19) = (cid:18)dy dz(z, y )(cid:19)|y =y (z,y),

(2.16)

where the r.h.s. may be viewed as the restriction onto solutions y (z, y) of a 2-form exact on
each factor of the product   r2. an important remark is in order. due to d2 = 0, the
2-forms dyz z  dyz + dyz z  dy z or dzyz  dz + dzyz  dz identically vanish in . this
yields two very particular classes of canonical transformations, in particular, those which allow
reparametrizations of z(z, y ) in the yz bre coordinate only. one has the following theorem.

theorem 1 on the smooth trivial bundle   r2, the vertical holomorphic change of local
coordinates,

z((z, z), (yz , y z ))  z((z, z), f(yz ), y z),

(2.17)

where f is a holomorphic function in yz, while the horizontal holomorphic change of local
coordinates,

yz(z, z, (yz , y z ))  yz(f (z), z, (yz , y z)),

(2.18)

where f is a holomorphic function in z, are both canonical transformations.

the latter type of canonical transformations states that the fundamental 2-form remains un-
changed under local holomorphic changes of the local z-coordinate on the basis, namely holo-
morphic changes of charts. in the former, one can restrict oneself to a very particular situa-
tion. since any smooth change of local complex coordinates on the base riemann surface ,
(z, z)  (z(z, z), z(z, z)), can be obtained by the generating function,

(z, y ) = z(z, z)yz + z(z, z)y z ,

(2.19)

one may consider more generally on   r2 the following holomorphically split generating
function in the vertical direction, namely,

(z, y ) = 1((z, z), yz ) + 1((z, z), y z).

(2.20)

6

considering the expansion around yz = y z = 0, the generating function  will be written

in formal power series,

(z, y ) = xn1

(cid:20) 1

(2.21)

where we have set (z, y )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)yz ,y

counterpart,

z =0 = 0, and introduced together with its complex conjugate

z (n)(z, z)  (cid:20) 1

n!(cid:18) 

yz(cid:19)n

1(z, y )(cid:21)|yz =0

(2.22)

as the jet coordinates of  at y = 0 with respect to y parametrized by (z, z). making use
of these jet coordinates will provide a new scenario for generating w -algebras. note also that
taking y = 0 implies y = 0.

we shall now introduce some quantities which will be useful in the sequel. let us denote,

(z, y ) = z

(z, y ) = z



yz


y z

(z, y ),

(z, y )(z, y ) = z

(z, y ),

(z, y )(z, y ) = z



yz


y z

(z, y ),

(z, y ).

(2.23)

before being restricted to the solutions y = y (z, y), the globally dened fundamental 2-form
(2.16) rewrites in the (z, y ) independent local coordinates,

(z, y ) = (cid:18)dyz + dy z(cid:19)  dz +(cid:18)dy z + dyz(cid:19)  dz

= dyz  (cid:18)dz + dz(cid:19) + dy z  (cid:18)dz + dz(cid:19)

from which one can read o by construction,

dzz(z, y ) = (z, y )(cid:18)dz + (z, y )dz(cid:19)

dy yz(z, y ) = (z, y )(cid:18)dyz +

(z, y )(z, y )

(z, y )

dy z(cid:19)

(2.24)

(2.25)

setting rather (z, y )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)yz ,y

 is connected to the identity map zyz + zy z .

=0 = 0(z, z), induces that 1-form y is dened up to the coboundary d0. also

z

7

(and the c.c. expressions). the latter reveal a parametrization of complex structures by a
beltrami dierential depending on the vertical coordinate y , (z, y ), on the base surface 

according to the complex coordinates (z, z), and by

(z, y )(z, y )

(z, y )

on the vertical ber when

(yz , y z ) complex coordinates are used. the restriction condition d|y =y (z,y) = 0 gives,

d|u(z,y )

= (z, y )dz  dz  dyz + ((z, y )(z, y ))dz  dz  dy z
+ ((z, y )(z, y ))dz  dz  dyz + (z, y )dz  dz  dy z
(cid:18)(z, y )(cid:18)dz + (z, y )dz(cid:19)(cid:19)  dyz
yz(cid:18)(z, y )(cid:18)dz + (z, y )dz(cid:19)(cid:19)  dy z = 0,

+ dy z 

+ dyz 





y z

and yields the beltrami identities,

(z, y ) = ((z, y )(z, y )),



y z

(z, y ) =



yz(cid:18)(z, y )(z, y )(cid:19)

together with their complex conjugate expressions. the liouville theorem follows from,

(2.26)

(2.27)

z(z, y )

z

det(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= (z, y )(z, y )(1  (z, y )(z, y )) = det(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

y(z, y )

y

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

(2.28)

therefore, one can consider two distinct smooth changes of local coordinates which are indeed
strictly related through the given generating function . the former on the base, (z, z) 
(z, z) for xed (yz , y z ), and the latter on the ber over (z, z), (yz, yz)  (yz, y z),

accordingly, the transformation laws of the derivative operators on each factor of the base

or on the cotangent ber respectively read,

z =

z  (z, y )z

(z, y )(1  (z, y )(z, y ))

,



yz

|y =y (z,y) = (z, y )(cid:18) 

yz

+ (z, y )



yz(cid:19)|y =y (z,y)  (z, y )|y =y (z,y)dz,

(2.29)

(2.30)

(with their c.c. expressions) and where the combination dz of the vertical derivatives with
respect to the (yz, yz) ber coordinates has been introduced. first, it has to be noted that
eqs.(2.27) infer the following important identity,

dz ln (z, y )|y =y (z,y) =

z

d

(z, y )|y =y (z,y) + (z, y )|y =y (z,y)dz|y =y (z,y)(z, y )

1  (z, y )|y =y (z,y)(z, y )|y =y (z,y)

,

(2.31)

8

with of course the c.c. formula, and secondly, from eq.(2.10) one gets,

(cid:20)z, dz(cid:21) = z log (z, y )|y =y (z,y)dz,
(cid:20)z, dz(cid:21) = z log (z, y )|y =y (z,y)dz

= (cid:18)(z, y )|y =y (z,y)dz  (z, y )|y =y (z,y)(cid:20)z, dz(cid:21)(cid:19),

(and the c.c. expressions), and,

(cid:20)dz, d

z(cid:21) = (dz(z, y )|y =y (z,y))


yz

z

 (d

(z, y )|y =y (z,y))

,

from which one veries that yz and yz turn out to be independent ber coordinates,

(cid:20) 

yz

,



yz(cid:21) = 0.

3 the smooth dieomorphism action

(2.32)

(2.33)

(2.34)

so far we have considered canonical transformations as changes of local coordinates on
the cotangent bundle t  while those generated by holomorphically split generating func-
tions in the vertical coordinates have been preferred. since our strategy amounts to choos-
ing (z, y ) as independent local coordinates with generating function (z, y ), it is recalled
that yz = (z, y ) denes a section of the cotangent bundle t   . one may won-
der how (z, y ) is aected by the action of smooth dieomorphisms of the trivial bundle
  r2 as a manifold with coordinates (z, y ).
in order to implement the dieomorphism
action, the brs dierential algebra setting will be used, see e.g.
[22]. we consider the ac-
tion of smooth dieomorphisms homotopic to the identity map, t = id + t c + o(t), where
c = z(z, y ) + z(z, y ) + z(z, y ) 
y , is the smooth faddeev-
yz
popov ghost associated to vector elds with respect to the background complex coordinates
(z, y ), s z = s y = 0. the corresponding innitesimal action on elds over the cotangent bundle
is obtained by a (graded) lie derivative encoded in a nilpotent brs operation s  lc = ic dd ic,
s 2 = 0.

+ z(z, y ) 

   +  

y

z

mathematically speaking, c is the generator of the grassmann algebra of the dual of the lie algebra of smooth

dieomorphisms.

9

then at the innitesimal level, the brs variation of (z, y ) locally writes,

s(z, y ) = lc(z, y ) = (z, y )  y(z, y ) + (z, y )  z(z, y )  (z, y ),

(3.1)

where (z, y ) is a grassmann function subject to s(z, y ) = 0. the variation of the funda-
mental 2-form (2.16) in u(z,y)  u(z,y ) writes,

s(z, y ) = dyz dz(z, y ),

(3.2)

and for the canonical 1-form one has, in virtue of eq.(2.15),

s|u(z,y)

s|u(z,y )

= dz(z, y )|y =y (z,y)
= (cid:20)d(cid:18)yz



(z, y ) + y z

yz



y z

(z, y )(cid:19)  dyz (z, y )(cid:21)|z=z(z,y )

(3.3)

in such a way that the invariance of  and  writes,

s z

 = s z

 = 0.

(3.4)

to the general canonical transformations given by eqs.(2.12) and (2.13) preserving the symplec-
tic form  as stated in eq.(2.6), there will correspond the innitesimal variations respectively,

syz(z, y ) = z(z, y ),

sz(z, y ) =



yz

(z, y )  z(z, y ),

(3.5)

and their complex conjugates. the latter is the innitesimal transformation of the new local
holomorphic coordinate z in terms of the ghost vector c = zz + z z expressed in the new
system (z, z). we also have,

s(z, y ) =



yz

z(z, y ),

s(cid:18)(z, y )(z, y )(cid:19) =



y z

z(z, y ).

(3.6)

in order to restore the explicit dependence in the y coordinates, from eqs.(3.5) and (2.30), one
denes,

sz(z, y )  z (z, y ) =



yz

(z, y )  (z, y )c(z, y ),

(3.7)

so that,

c(z, y ) =

1

(z, y )

z(z, y )

10

(3.8)

we now restrict ourselves to the solutions y = y (z, y) according to the strategy dened in

eq.(2.30),

where we have set,

c(z, y )|y =y (z,y) = dz(cid:18)(z, y )|y =y (z,y)(cid:19)

= c(z, y) + (z, y )|y =y (z,y)c(z, y),

(3.9)

c(z, y) =



yz(cid:18)(z, y )|y =y (z,y)(cid:19),

c(z, y) =



yz(cid:18)(z, y )|y =y (z,y)(cid:19).

(3.10)

thus eq.(3.8) when restricted to the solutions y = y (z, y) is given by (3.9) in terms of a
derivative of  with respect the background (yz, yz) local ber coordinates. this ansatz is of
course strongly supported by the implicit function theorem which is supposed to be understood
from now. moreover, one has the following identity,

(cid:20)s, dz(cid:21) = c(z, y )z log (z, y )dz  c(z, y )dz

= c(z, y )(cid:20), dz(cid:21)  c(z, y )dz

which yields the variations,

s(z, y ) = (cid:18)(z, y )c(z, y )(cid:19)

s(z, y ) = c(z, y )(z, y )  (z, y )c(z, y ) + c(z, y )

sc(z, y ) = c(z, y )c(z, y )

sc(z, y) = (c(z, y) + c(z, y))c(z, y)

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

(and their c.c. expressions).

4 towards a w -algebra presentation

we have previously chosen canonical transformations described by the change of local com-

plex coordinates parametrized by y ,

z(z, z)  z((z, z), yz ) = z(z, z) + xn2

n z (n)(z, z)yz

n1

(4.1)

11

where z (n)(z, z) has been dened in eq.(2.22). the choice of yz as an independent variable,
accordingly gives that the mappings,

(z, z)  (z (n), z

(n)

),

n  1,

(4.2)

generate a tower of smooth changes of local complex coordinates on the base riemann surface,
each of them will be shown to be local solutions of a beltrami like equation.

4.1 the complex structures underlying the z (n) local complex coordinates

it is now shown how each (z (n), z

(n)

) coordinates dene new complex coordinates pertaining

to a complex structure. indeed, by construction one can write,

dzz (n)(z, z) = (cid:20) 1
 z (n)

where we have introduced

(z, z)  (cid:20) 1
z (n)

z =0  z (n)(z, z).

z (n)
z

(z, z)z

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

since the generating function is supposed to be complex analytic in y , both the convergence of
the series (2.21) and the requirement that the mappings, (z, z)  (z (n), z
), preserve the
orientation lead to the condition |z

z((z, z), n)|  1.

obviously few examples can better clarify this point; this will be performed in the most

simple cases in the next section.

we do not pretend to exhaust and to classify all the w algebras in our context (more
examples and a deeper insight in critical situations will be needed), but we hope to reduce to
an unique geometrical setting the more common w algebras studied in the literature.

4.2 the w -symmetry

we derive now a w -symmetry from the previous construction combining both the dieo-
morphism action and the canonical transformations via the b.r.s machinery. for each n we
dene the dieomorphism action on the local complex coordinate z (n) by,

sz (n)(z, z)  (n)(z, z)  (cid:20) 1

n!(cid:18) 

yz(cid:19)n

(z, y )(cid:21)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)yz ,y

z =0

(4.10)

13

which are invariant ghost functions since the s nilpotency gives:

s(n)(z, z) = 0.

in more details, one has

(n)(z, z) = (cid:20) 1
= z (n)

n!(cid:18)

c(n)(z, z) = (cid:20) 1

(4.13)

and where the non local coecients (k1)(n, (z, z)) have been previously introduced in eq.(4.9).
from the very denitions one obtains the obvious law of transformation under dieomor-

phisms,

sc(n) =

n

xr=1

r c(r)zc(nr+1).

moreover, one can see that the (n, 1)-conformal elds (4.8) are also given by,

(n)
z =


c

c(n),

(4.14)

(4.15)

so that by a trick related to dieomorphisms [23], namely, (cid:26)s,

brs variations,



c(cid:27) = , one easily obtains their

where the new ghost vector eld,

has as variation,

kz((z, z), n) =

n

xk=1

(k1)(n, (z, z)) c(k)(z, z)

skz((z, z), n) = kz((z, z), n)kz ((z, z), n),

and since by construction,

(4.19)

s(cid:20)z (n)

one nally gets,

(z, z)z

z((z, z), n)(cid:21) = sz (n) = (n) = (z (n)

z((z, z), n) = kz((z, z), n)z

z((z, z), n)  z

z((z, z), n)kz((z, z), n) + kz((z, z), n). (4.21)

for each n a dieomorphism brs-structure with a ghost kz((z, z), n) (non local in the complex
structure parameters) can be put into evidence.

while the case n = 1 identies the dieomorphism symmetry, we show now that for each

sector of the grading n = 1    we shall individuate a w symmetry.

the new ghost elds dened by:

q!(cid:18) 
with c(1,0)(z, z) = cz(z, y)|y=0, transform as,

c(p,q)(z, z) = (cid:20) 1

(4.23)

notice that the variations of c(p,q) contain the elds c(r,s) with degrees r  p and s  q. the
previous transformations (4.23) induce the following commutation relations, for currents dened
through the nilpotent functional brs operator,

  z

c(p,q)(cid:19),

(4.24)

15

namely, {, } = 0, leads to,

(cid:20)t(p,q)(z, z), t(r,s)(z, z)(cid:21) = p z(2)(z  z)t(p+r1,q+s)(z, z)  r z(2)(z  z)t(p+r1,q+s)(z, z)

+ q z(2)(z  z)t(p+r,q+s1)(z, z)  s z(2)(z  z)t(p+r,q+s1)(z, z).

(4.25)

which turn out to be a realization of the so-called w-algebra according to [10], if no limit is
put on the grading indices. otherwise, if a truncation criterium is given (by xing a suitable
upper limit on the series in eq.(2.21)) a wn-algebra (with n obviously nite) can be constructed
as will be seen in the next section for the most simple examples.

5 the w3 example

in the literature there exist two types of the named w3-algebra, namely the former is obtained
by a eld realization [10, 14] which is on-shell, while the latter is given by reduction [7, 15,
16, 17].
it will be shown down below how those two realizations of w3-algebra, will be re-
obtained from our construction only grounded on the combination of canonical transformations
and dieomorphisms.

5.1 the chiral w3-gravity

we have seen in the preceding section how the sequences of smooth changes of local complex

coordinates,

(z, z)  (z (n), z

(n)

),

n = 1, 2    

(5.1)

generate the w algebra. by the way we can arbitrarily truncate the series to a non empty
subset (or at least only one) of these invariance laws and see the physical consequences it will
imply. the simplest example is obtained by considering only the smooth change of local complex
coordinates,

(z, z)  (z (2), z

(2)

),

while neglecting the previous one of the lower order,

(z, z)  (z, z).

16

(5.2)

(5.3)

this will show, upon imposing the dieomorphism invariance, the coordinate origin of the chiral
w3 algebra previously obtained by sorella et al [14].

following the notation of the previous section we have successively,

sz (2) = (2) = z (2)

z

z (2)
z = z (2),
c + 2c(2)  z (2)
z = (2) = (cid:18)z (2)

 = z,
z kz(2),
z kz(2)(cid:19)

sz (2)

kz(2) = c +

where we have set

2

(z
z )
z (2)

z

c(2)  c +

z
2

c(2),

z =

2
2(z
z )
z (2)

z

.

the nilpotency condition on sz (2) gives,

skz(2) = kz(2)kz (2).

(5.4)

(5.5)

(5.6)

(5.7)

(5.8)

the decomposition of the ghost kz(2) turn out to be so useful to see how the underlying
coordinate z behaves under the cotangent dieomorphisms.

in fact while the c term is the usual ghost of the (z, z)  (z, z) mapping, the z

2 c(2)
term upgrades the dieomorphism to the (z, z)  (z (2), z
) level. the parameter z does
contain the relative change of the z coordinate with respect to the background (z, z) used to
describe the (z (2), z
) invariance. so the independent study of the behaviour of kz(2) and
z
2 c(2) under eq (5.8) gives more details on the realization of the dieomorphism. in order to
have a more precise geometrical information we shall x the c(2) brs transformation to be,

(2)

(2)

sc(2) = cc(2) + 2c(2)c,

(5.9)

in order to deduce the consistent transformation of z and to derive the consistent breaking of
the symmetry (z, z)  (z, z).

now, in term of the k(2) ghost the previous equation (5.9) rewrites,

sc(2) = kz(2)c(2) + 2c(2)kz(2) 

c(2)c(2)

3
2

(5.10)

17

where eq.(5.6) has been used. in particular we get,

s(cid:18)c(2)c(2)(cid:19) = kz(2)(c(2)c(2))  3c(2)c(2)kz(2).

the nilpotency condition on c(2) reads,

0 = s 2c(2) = (cid:18)skz(2)  kz(2)kz (2)(cid:19)c(2)  2c(2)(cid:18)skz(2)  kz(2)kz (2)(cid:19) 
2(cid:18)s  (kz(2))(cid:19)c(2)c(2).



3

(5.11)

(5.12)

modifying in a consistent way the brs transformations of both c and  while preserving
eq.(5.6), allows one to set,

where, from the nilpotency condition,

sc = cc + x ,

now from s 2c(2) = 0 we obtain,

which can be solved by setting,

sx = cx  cx .

x c(2) = 2c(2)x

x = c(2)c(2) 16

c(2)3c(2)(cid:19)

(5.13)

(5.14)

(5.15)

(5.16)

where we have been forced to introduce a spin (2, 0)-conformal eld t . since x has to satisfy
eq.(5.14), t is subject to the consistency condition,

st = ct + 2ct + c(2)w +

c(2)w + 3c

2
3

(5.17)

which allows us to introduce a spin (3, 0)-conformal eld w whose brs behaviour can be
calculated from the nilpotency condition applied on (5.17). to sum up, we have computed the
most general deformation of the c ghost eld compatible with the xed variation (5.9) of c(2).
from the very denition (5.6) of kz(2), and after using (5.10), the variation skz(2) can be

expressed in terms of both the kz(2) and c(2) ghosts only. one gets,

(cid:18)skz(2)  kz(2)kz (2)(cid:19)  (cid:18)s(cid:18) z

2 (cid:19)  (cid:18) z

2

kz(2)(cid:19)(cid:19)c(2) = x  c(2)c(2)(cid:18) 2
2 (cid:19)

z

(5.18)

18

requiring the dieomorphism symmetry implemented by (5.8), on the one hand, eq.(5.12)
reduces to,

(cid:18)c(2)c(2)(cid:19)(cid:20)s(cid:18)z(cid:19)  (cid:18)zkz(2)(cid:19)(cid:21) = 0.

(5.19)

and on the other hand, by plugging (5.16) into (5.18), one gets,

c(2)(cid:18)s(cid:18) z

2 (cid:19)  (cid:18) z

2

kz(2)(cid:19)(cid:19) = c(2)c(2)(cid:18) 16

z

2 (cid:19) + (cid:18)c(2)2c(2)

a direct comparison shows that  = 0, and thus

where  is a ghost graded zero quadratic dierential which labels a - ambiguity. the nilpo-
tency allows to compute the brs variation of . however as above, the latter will be exhibited
up to a - ambiguity and so on. the closure of a minimal brs algebra will be achieved by
imposing,

so that we are left with

(5.22)

(5.23)

(5.24)

showing that both the elds t and w are non local elds. finally for the sake of consistency,
one checks,

s(cid:18)kz(2)(cid:19) = 0.

(5.25)

in the case (5.19) the smooth change of complex coordinates (z, z)  (z (2), z

) will be
preserved under dieomorphisms and the ghost kz(2) transforms as a factorized ghost vector
eld, while

19

(5.26)

the parameter z

z is compatible with the complex structure dened by the z (2) coordinates,

and the geometrical quantities z

are covariant ; in particular the object:

z

sj = kz(2)j .

transforms as:

the latter implies,

(  ((z, z), 2))j 



z (2)

j = 0

so that j is holomorphic in z (2). so we can parametrize:

in conclusion the well-dened (chiral) brs algebra (already treated in [14] in a brs frame-

work), dened by

sc = cc +

sc(2) = cc(2) + 2c(2)c,

s = (cid:18)(cid:18)c +

2

c(2)(cid:19)(cid:19)(5.31)

describes a dieomorphism symmetry hidden in the choice of the parameters which leads to a
dieomorphism ghost kz(2) = c + z

2 c(2).

the z parameter describes the relative tuning between the change of complex coordinates

(z, z)  (z (2), z

(2)

) with respect to the same (z, z) background, namely

z =

kz(2)
c(2)

.

(5.32)

5.2 the induced w3-gravity

according to theorem 1, one considers as a canonical transformation the following vertical
smooth change of coordinates z(z, y )  z (z, y ), where z(z, y ) = yz (z, y ) and where
z (z, y ) is dened by the following replacement,

z (2)(z, z)  z (2)((z, z), yz ) 

1

2(cid:18) 

yz(cid:19)2

(z, y ) = xn0

(n + 2)(n + 1)

2

z z (2+n)(z, z) (5.33)
y n

20

in the expansion (4.1) of the z(z, y ) coordinate. one has

z (z, y ) = z(z, z) + 2 yz z (2)(z, z) + xn2

(n + 1)2 y n

z z (n+1)(z, z),

(5.34)

showing that the corresponding generating function  coincides with  up to the second order
in yz. furthermore, z (2)((z, z), yz ) has as brs variation,

sz (2)((z, z), yz ) =

1

2(cid:18) 

yz(cid:19)2

(z, y ) 

1

2 xn0

(n + 2)(n + 1)y n

z (n+2)(z, z) =

= z (2)

z

(z, z)c(z, z) + 2(z, z)c(2)(z, z) + z (2)

((z, z), yz )  z (2)

z

((z, z), yz )kz

2((z, z), yz ),(5.35)

where in complete analogy with the construction given in section 3 we have,

skz

2((z, z), yz ) = kz

2((z, z), yz )kz

2((z, z), yz )

now it is easy to realize that

z (2)
z

((z, z), yz )  z (2)((z, z), yz ) = z (2)

z

(z, z) + xn1

(n + 2)(n + 1)y n

z z (2+n)

z

from which, similarly to the previous example, it follows that,

(5.36)

(z, z)

(5.37)

kz

2((z, z), yz ) = c(z, z) +

 c(z, z) +

2(z, z)
z (2)
((z, z), yz )

z((z, z), yz )

z

2

c(2)(z, z) + z((z, z), yz )

c(2)(z, z) + z((z, z), yz )

(5.38)

therefore if we impose the condition eq(5.36) together with eqs.(5.13)(5.9), the previous con-
z((z, z), yz ) and z((z, z), yz ) are
dition  = 0 can be avoided since the b.r.s variations of 
at our disposal for this purpose. we do not write these variations since they are unimportant
in the treatment. but it has to be noted that in the (z, z) plane (with no yz dependence) only
the couple of ghost elds c(z, z), c(2)(z, z) will survive and whose brs variations are given by,

sc = cc  c(2)c(2) 16
3
sc(2) = cc(2) + 2c(2)c,

t + (cid:18)c(2)2c(2) 

2
3

c(2)3c(2)(cid:19)

(5.39)

21

where for the sake of deniteness t turns out to be a projective connection, in contrast to
the quadratic dierential constructed in the previous example. the nilpotency condition infers
altogether that t is assigned a well dened transformation law

st = ct + 2ct  c(2)w 

c(2)w + 3c,

2
3

in terms of a cubic dierential w, whose variation is,

sw = cw + 3cw +

2
3

t (cid:18)c(2)t (cid:19) +



24(cid:18)5c(2) + 2c(2)3t

+ 10t 3c(2) + 15t 2c(2) + 92t c(2)(cid:19).

(5.40)

(5.41)

however the nilpotency condition on w holds whatever  is. requiring that all the variations
are globally dened infers that  = 1. thus we get the well-dened exact dierential system,

sc = cc 

16
3

c(2)c(2)t + (cid:18)c(2)2c(2) 

2
3

c(2)3c(2)(cid:19)

sc(2) = cc(2) + 2c(2)c

st = ct + 2ct  24c(2)w  16c(2)w + 3c
24(cid:18)5c(2)

t (cid:18)c(2)t (cid:19) +

1

sw = cw + 3cw +

2
3

+ 2c(2)3t + 10t 3c(2) + 15t 2c(2) + 92t c(2)(cid:19)

(5.42)

this brs algebra has already been described in a dierent context by [17], [18].

6 conclusions

in this paper we have introduced a systematic approach to w -algebras based on canonical
transformations by means of an abstract symplectic structure.
it is however as claimed by
witten and hull, the action of dieomorphisms of the cotangent bundle which generates these
w -symmetries. our construction provides a brs formulation of a local symmetry which is
recognized to be that of w -algebras (see bilal et al. in [7], and [11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]) but
without any care about the opes of primary elds. it may also shed some new light in the
study of their geometrical structure [7].

as shown for the w3 specic examples, various w -algebras may emerge from the construc-
tion. moreover, one may ask oneself about the link between the truncation procedure in the yz

22

variable (which xes the rank of the algebra) and the relative conformal weights of the pri-
mary elds whose opes give rise to the algebras. one answer to this question might originate
from the locality principle of qft and the intrinsic symplectic structure introduced through the
canonical quantization scheme. indeed, by xing the maximum order of the coframe in the yz
coordinate, the relative eld momentum representation in the associated field theory carries
this operation in its tensorial content, but the mechanism is not completely understood by the
authors yet. in the paper, we have also presented a possible space-time origin of these algebras
which ought to be useful in the study of induced w -gravity. although most of our discussion
have been rather complete and general, the absence of a physical-phenomenological framework
is the more important limit of the present treatment.

more examples are needed for further investigations in the role played by such symmetries
in physics, as recalled in the introduction. this requires either a lagrangian or an hamilto-
nian approach in which the quantization procedure can be performed according to the physical
context. the former will be studied elsewhere.
