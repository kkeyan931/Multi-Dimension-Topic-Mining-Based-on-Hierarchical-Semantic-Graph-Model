abstract

bps electric and magnetic black hole solutions which break half of supersym-
metry in the theory of n = 2 ve-dimensional supergravity are discussed.
for models which arise as compactications of m-theory on a calabi-yau
manifold, these solutions correspond, respectively, to the two and ve branes
wrapping around the homology cycles of the calabi-yau compact space. the
electric solutions are reviewed and the magnetic solutions are constructed.
the near-horizon physics of these solutions is examined and in particular
the phenomenon of the enhancement of supersymmetry. the solutions for
the supersymmetric killing spinor of the near horizon geometry, identied as
ads3  s2 and ads2  s3 are also given.

introduction

considerable progress has been made in the study of bps black hole states of the low-
energy eective actions of compactied string and m-theory 2. this was mainly motivated
by the important role that these states play in the understanding of the non-perturbative
structure behind string theory. toroidal compactications of string theory give rise to
vacua with n = 4 and n = 8 supersymmetry and bps states of these models are
restricted by the large supersymmetry. corrections to these solutions and their entropies
can only arise from higher loops, as the lowest order corrections are known to vanish. four
and ve dimensional n = 2 supergravity models coupled to vector and hyper-multiplets
can arise, for example, from type ii string and m-theory compactied on a calabi-yau
threefold. an important step in the study of n = 2 black holes was the realisation that
their entropy is given in terms of the extremum of the central charge and that the scalar
elds of the theory take xed values at the horizon independent of their boundary values
at spatial innity [1].

the perturbative and nonperturbative corrections for the n = 2 supergravity
models seem to make the study of their bps black hole solutions more intricate. however,
the rich geometric structure of these theories [3, 4] considerably simplies the analysis of
their black hole solutions. for instance, the black hole metric in four dimensions can
be expressed in terms of symplectic invariant quantities where the symplectic sections
satisfy algebraic constraints involving a set of constrained harmonic functions [5]. in a
similar way to einstein-maxwell theory [6], dierent types of solutions can be obtained
depending on the choice of harmonic functions. the solutions also depend on the choice of
the prepotential which denes the theory. in ve dimensions, the black hole solutions [7]
can be expressed in terms of the rescaled cubic homogeneous prepotential which denes
very special geometry [4].

the bps solutions can be regarded as solitons interpolating between two vacua:
minkowski at space at innity and adsp+2  sdp2 near the horizon [8, 9, 10], where
p is the dimensionality of the solution. anti-de sitter spaces and spheres are known
to admit killing spinors which we refer to as geometric killing spinors. at a generic
point in space-time, the bps solution breaks half of supersymmetry. however, if at
the near horizon the supersymmetric killing spinor, dened by the zero mode of the
gravitinio supersymmetry transformation, can be identied with the geometric spinor,
then supersymmetry is enhanced. this restoration of supersymmetry have been discussed
in the literature for the cases where the near horizon geometry was identied with the
spaces ads2  s2 [8, 9], ads5  s5, ads3  s7 , and ads7  s3 [10]. in ve dimensional
supergravity models with vector multiplets, our concern in this paper, the restoration of
supersymmetry of a double-extreme black hole solutions [11] near the horizon in four and
ve dimensions has been discussed in [1, 12] and also for the rotating case in [13]. the
analysis of the pure ve dimensional supergravity case (without vector multiplets) was

2for reviews see for example [2]

performed in [14].

general bps black hole solutions which break half of supersymmetry of d = 5,
n = 2 supergravity theory with an arbitrary number of vector supermultiplets, were
obtained in [7]. there it was also demonstrated that the entropy of these black holes
is given in terms of the extremised central charge. the near horizon geometry of these
solutions is the same as that of the double-extreme solutions in accordance with the
attractor behaviour. the main result of this paper is the analysis of general magnetic-
string solutions3, which in compactied m-theory on a calabi-yau manifold, correspond
to ve branes wrapped around the four cycles of the calabi-yau compact space. the
enhancement of supersymmetry at the near horizon of these solutions is shown and we
derive the expression of the killing spinor of the maximally supersymmetric horizon. the
analysis of [12] is also completed by obtaining the form of the killing spinor for the near
horizon geometry for the electric bps solution given by ads2  s3.

the theory of ve dimensional n = 2 supergravity with vector supermultiplets was con-
sidered in [17]. the compactication of n = 1, d = 11 supergravity [16], i. e., the low
energy limit of m-theory, down to ve dimensions on calabi-yau 3-folds (cy3), results
in a d = 5, n = 2 supergravity coupled to abelian vector supermultiplets based on the
structure of very special geometry [4]. the ve dimensional theory contains the gravity
multiplet, h(1,1)  1 vector multiplets and h(2,1) + 1 hypermultiplets, (h(1,1), h(2,1)) are the
hodge numbers of cy3. the (h(1,1)  1)-dimensional space of scalar components of the
abelian vector supermultiplets coupled to supergravity can be regarded as a hypersurface
of a h(1,1)-dimensional manifold whose coordinates x i() are in correspondence with the
vector bosons (including the graviphoton). in ve dimensions, an n = 2 vector super-
multiplet has a single scalar eld and therefore the scalar manifold is real. the dening
equation of the hypersurface is

v(x) = 1

(2)

and the prepotential v is a homogeneous cubic polynomial in the coordinates x i()

v(x) =

where cijk are the topological intersection numbers and xi are the dual special coor-
dinates (the four cycles).

of 3 m-5-branes and a boost along the common string in [15]

2 electric bps black holes

in the compactied m-theory on a calabi-yau manifold, electrically point and magneti-
cally charged string-like bps states correspond to the two- and ve-branes of m-theory
wrapped around the two- and four-cycles of the calabi-yau space. though the details of
the low-energy lagrangian depend very much on the compactied calabi-yau space, the
analysis of the bps solutions can be considerably simplied by the rich geometric struc-
ture based on very special geometry [4] underlying the n = 2 ve-dimensional theories
with vector supermultiplets. electrically charged bps solutions of the ve dimensional
theory have been analyzed in [7] and will be reviewed in this section.

the supersymmetry transformation laws for the fermi elds in a bosonic back-

ground are given by [7, 17]

where  is the supersymmetry parameter and d the covariant derivative.4 the metric
for the bps electric black hole solutions can be brought to the form [7]

ds2 = e4u (dt + wmdxm)2 + e2u (d~x)2.

(6)

the vanishing of the supersymmetry transformations of the gravitino and gauginos, for
the choice 0 = i, imposes the following relations for the supersymmetry variation
parameter, u, wm, the scalar elds and the gauge elds

t = 0,
(m + mu) = 0,

(8)

where 0 is a constant spinor satisfying 0 = i.

the various physical variables can be xed in terms of space-time functions, by
solving the equations of motion for the gauge elds 5. from the lagrangian (1), we derive
the following equation of motion for the gauge elds,

(10)

where hi are harmonic functions, hi = hi + qi

r2 , hi are constants and qi are electric

it is convenient to express the solution in terms of the geometry of the internal

space, i. e., in terms of the cubic polynomial v. dene the rescaled coordinates

then the underlying very special geometry implies that

yi = e2u xi ,

y i = eu x i ,

e3u = v(y ) =

cijky i y j y k ,

and thus the electric black hole solution metric has the form

ds2 = v 4/3(y )(dt + mdxm)2 + v 2/3(y )(d~x)2,

black holes with rotational symmetry can be constructed using the above general
solution. changing to polar coordinates dened by, x1 + ix2 = r sin ei, x3 + ix4 =
r cos ei, and specializing to solutions with rotational symmetry in the two orthogonal
planes, i. e., w = w(r, ), w = w(r, ), wr =  = 0, then the self-duality condition
of the eld strength of wm gives for a decaying solution, w =  
r2 cos2 .
therefore, the general form of the metric solution with rotational symmetry in the two
orthogonal planes is given by

r2 sin2 , w = 

ds2 = v 4/3(y )(cid:16)dt

where

d2

3 = (d2 + sin2 d2 + cos2 d2).

(14)

(15)

it was demonstrated in [12] that for double-extreme black holes in ve dimensions

supersymmetry is enhanced at the near horizon where the metric takes the form

ds2 = (

2r
r0

)2dt2 + (

2r
r0

)2dr2 + r2

0d2
3,

(16)

with the geometry ads2  s3. also these results were extended to the rotating case where
similar conclusions hold [13]. in reality one can obtain the stronger result that for a general
electric bps black hole in ve dimensions with vector supermultiplets, supersymmetry
is restored at the near-horizon. this is because both extreme and double-extreme black
holes have the same form of metric at the near horizon. this can be seen by examining the
general solution near the horizon, (r  0). there v(y ) can be approximated as follows.

vhor(y ) =

1
3

(y i hi)hor =

1
3

(y i)hor(

qi
r2 ).

however, y i

hor = v 1/3

hor (y )x i

hor, and thus

v 2/3
hor (y ) =

1
3

(ze)cr

r2

(17)

(18)

where ze = qi x i is the electric central charge, and (ze)cr is its value at the horizon.
moreover, equation (10) which denes the moduli over space-time becomes near the hori-
zon

(zexi)hor = qi ,

(19)

which is what one obtains from the extremisation of the central charge. comparison of
the form of our metric near the horizon with (16), implies that the two forms are related
by

r2
0 =

(ze)cr

3

,

r =

2r0

.

(20)

the proof for the enhancement of supersymmetry for the double extreme black hole
solution therefore remains unchanged for the general electric bps solution as the metrics
near the horizon are identical.

here we complete the analysis by solving for the killing spinor near the horizon.

there the gravitino supersymmetry transformations become

3 bps magnetic solutions

in this section we construct general bps magnetic string-like solutions which break half
of supersymmetry of d = 5, n = 2 supergravity theory coupled to vector supermultiplets.
as a general metric for the magnetic string-solution we write

ds2 = e2v (dt2 + dz2) + e2u (d~x)2,

(23)

where (d~x)2 = (dx1)2 +(dx2)2 +(dx3)2, and (x1, x2, x3) are the transverse dimensions. the
functions u and v are taken to be independent of (t, z). the non-vanishing funfbeins for
the metric in (23) are

(24)

(25)

first we consider the supersymmetry variation of the gauginos and nd the conditions
that must be satised by a supersymmetric bosonic conguration. these conditions are
obtained by setting the fermions and their supersymmetry variations to zero. using (4),
the gaugino transformation can be rewritten in the form

i = 

1
4 (cid:16)gij ix i f j

  3ixi ix i(cid:17) .

the vanishing of the gaugino transformation thus gives

gij ix i (cid:16)mnf j

mn + 2imx j m(cid:17)  = 0,

where we have used the relation

gij x j = 

3
2

xi ,

(26)

(27)

(28)

which follows from very special geometry. assuming that the susy parameter satises

 = 10,

(29)

a condition which implies that half of supersymmetry is broken. using (29), it can be
shown that

(30)
if one also writes x i = eu h i, then (27) together with the relation x iix i = 0, implies
the following

mn = ie3u mnpp,

this, with (30) x the gauge eld strengths to be

mnf i

mn = 2ieu ph ip.

f i
mn = mnpph i .

moreover, using the relation 1

6 cijkx i x j x k = 1, one concludes that

e3u =

1
6

cijkh ih j h k.

(31)

(32)

(33)

therefore, using the relations of very special geometry, the vanishing of the gaugino
supersymmetry variation for a choice of the supersymmetry parameter, xes the relation
between the gauge eld strengths, x i and u.

the vanishing of the gravitino supersymmetry transformation xes the metric as

well as the supersymmetry parameter itself. the vanishing of the t-component gives

t = (cid:18)t +

moreover, using the expressions for the scalar elds and gauge eld strengths we get

mn =

a a0.

therefore, from (34), we get the conditions

v =

u,

t = 0.

similarly, the z component of the gravitino supersymmetry variation gives

(36)

(37)

z = (cid:18)z +

mn(cid:19) .
using ximnf i
a a , we deduce that z =
0. moreover, one obtains from the vanishing of the space-components of the gravitino
supersymmetry variations

mn = 2ippu , z = e1

z 1, p = ep

where 0 is a constant spinor satisfying  = 10.

here we give a summary of what we have done so far. we are seeking a background

which breaks supersymmetry and we have obtained the following conguration

f i
mn = mnpph i,

x i = eu h i ,

v = 

1
2

u.

(41)

in order to x the scalar functions h i, one has to solve for the equations of motion and
the bianchi identities for the gauge elds. doing so, the h i are then xed and are given
by a set of harmonic functions

h i = gi +

,

(42)

pi
r

where gi are constants and pi are magnetic charges. as for the electric black hole solutions,
we dene new coordinates y i = eu x i , in terms of which the magnetic string solution
takes the following simple form

3 (dt2 + dz2) + v(y )

ds2 = v(y ) 1
f i
mn = mnpph i ,
y i = h i .

2

3 (dr2 + r2d2 + r2 sin2 d2),

(43)

in the electric case, the horizon geometry is given by ads2  s3 and the black
hole entropy, related to the horizon volume s3, is given in terms of the extremised electric

9

central charge. for the magnetically charged d = 5 bps black string, one similarly nd
that for our solution the extremised value of the bps tension is related to the volume
of the s2 where the near horizon geometry is given by ads3  s2. this can be easily
demonstrated. the magnetic central charge related to the tension of the magnetic string
states is dened by zm = pi xi. to nd the extremum we set

izm = i(xi)pi =

1
3

cijkx ii(x j )pk = 0.

it follows that the critical values of x i and its dual are given by [18]

x i =

pi
zm

,

xi =

cijkpj pk

z 2

and thus the critical value of the bps string tension is

(zm)3

cr =

cijkpipj pk .

at the near horizon (r  0) we have

e3u =

(44)

(45)

(46)

(47)

therefore the values of the moduli at the horizon are those which extremise the magnetic
central charge. with these limits, the metric and the gauge elds at the horizon could
then be expressed in the form

r

ds2 =

we now demonstrate the enhancement of supersymmetry at the horizon for the
magnetic solutions. for the near horizon metric, the gaugino transformation reduces to

(49)

the above variation vanishes identically without any conditions imposed on the super-
symmetry parameter. this is basically due to the fact that the magnetic central charge is

10

extremised at the horizon. from the gravitino supersymmetry transformations near the
horizon we get the equations

in conclusion, with the help of the relations of very special geometry, bps electric
and magnetic solutions of m-theory on a calabi-yau manifold were obtained. our analysis
applies to all n = 2 ve dimensional supergravity and not only to models with higher-
dimensional origin, i.e, those obtained from compactifying 11-dimensional supergravity
on a calabi-yau manifold. the solutions depend on the prepotential which denes the
theory. we note that in the electric solutions, the rescaled four-cycles yi are given in terms
of harmonic functions and thus in order to nd the explicit space-time solution one has
to solve for the two-cycles x i. in the magnetic case, however, it is the rescaled two-cycle
which is given in terms of a harmonic function and thus the explicit space-time solution
is known for all prepotentials. we have demonstrated that supersymmetry in enhanced
at the near horizon of the general electric and magnetic solutions. the solutions for the
killing spinors of the near horizon geometries, ads2  s3 and ads3  s2 are given.

6the dependence of the killing spinor on zm can be absorbed by the redenition of coordinates,
