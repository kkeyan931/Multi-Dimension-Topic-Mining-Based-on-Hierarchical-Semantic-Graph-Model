+(cid:18) dy 2z0 2z0 d(cid:18) ds d(cid:19)2 = l2 2 (2.4) order obtain l2 4a=2 = 2 2z0 d(cid:18)(cid:18)dx 2z0 d"(cid:18) dx d(cid:19)2 d(cid:19) + y(cid:19)2 + 2 dx d# . + 2y d(cid:19)2 +(cid:18) dy

prove  5 theorem 2.1.if y( ) smooth function period 2 y( ) = 2r0 0, inequality (2.6) holds becomes equality y( ) = cos + b sin ,i.e. trajectory circle(physical appli- cations fact discussed ref.) result (2.1) extended case curve may self-intersections. going need case how- ever.instead,we shall consider extension result nonat sur- faces. case sphere radius r ,it could shown  l2 4a - a2 r2 (2.7) equality holding circle sphere.in case pseudo- sphere (surface constant negative curvature )of radius r= , i=1 ,we obtain, instead (2.7),the following result: l2 + 4 . (2.8) obviously,if (2.8) holds ,then inequality type given (2.1) holds well.beacause this, following ahlfors  ,let us dene extremal length () via () = sup l2() a() (2.9) closed set curves metric surface dened way lc () =zc |dz| a() =zz 2dxdy 6 (2.10) (2.11) area enclosed contour c z = x + iy . curves well surfaces boundaries. remark 2.2. denition () extended open get feeling results ,let us consider rectangle r sides b let c curve joins opposite sides rectangle. then,for and,from here, az0 (x + iy) dx lc() bz0 az0 dxdy blc() . (2.12) (2.13) help (2.11) (2.13) obtain well b2l2() ab az0 bz0 2dxdy = aba r() . (2.14) result obtained help schwarz-type inequality  zzr 2 1dxdy zzr 2dxdyzzr dxdy 1 = abzzr 2dxdy . (2.15) inequality (2.14) produces ,in turn, b l2() r() () . (2.16) time,if choose = 1 inside r (and = 0 outside),then l() = ab = a() () b . arrive conclusion ,that rectangle r b = ( r) . 7 (2.17) denition,the modulus = b = 1 ,in general, m() = inf a() l2() . help obtain rectangle r following result : r() =zzr 2dxdy a2m . (2.18) (2.19) happens central result entire development shall demonstrate rest work.to purpose ,let us discuss related problem calculation modulus annulus ,i.e. doubly connected region made two concentric rings c1 c2 radius r1 < r2 .by choosing polar system coordinates,we obtain ,by analogy (2.12), l() 2z0 (cid:0)rei(cid:1) rd (2.20) closed curve separates c1 c2 .from here, l() r 2z0 l() ln(cid:18)r2 r1(cid:19) zzd drd . (2.21) resembles much (2.13) and,therefore,by analogy (2.14) obtain , l2() ln2(cid:18)r2 r1(cid:19) zzd 2 drd . 8 (2.22) again,using schwarz inequality, zzd 1 r 2 dr dr r 2z0 rdrd r2zr1 r1(cid:19) 2 ln(cid:18)r2 l2() ln2(cid:18) r2 zzd r1(cid:19)zzd nally obtain, produces immediately l2() a() 2 r1(cid:17) . ln(cid:16) r2 rdrd , (2.23) rdrd . (2.24) (2.25) choose = 2r (where parameter determined below,in eq.(2.23)),then (2.25) converted equality l() = a() = a2 r1(cid:17) .as case rectangle ,we conclude,that 2 ln(cid:16) r2 m( d) = 1 2 r1(cid:19) . ln(cid:18)r2 accordingly,by analogy (2.19) ,we write a( d) l2()m( d) (2.26) (2.27) case coincides obviously eq.(2.25). let us observe that,actually,the rectangle r annulus could mapped conformally other. moreover,it shown () conformal invariant.this easily understood notice conformal mapping z z have, construction , ,accordingly,the area da dened |dz| = |dz| da = 2dx dy = 2 2 dz dz = 2 2 9 dz dez . (2.28) (2.29) invariance da follows directly invariance length element dl = |dz| checked directly eq.(2.29). clearly,the metric determines surface properties.in particular,the singularities metric correspond surface singularities (defects) shall demonstrate. meantime,let us consider detail conformal mapping rectangle r onto .to facilitate understanding ,it useful visualize mapping,e.g.see fig.1.the mapping plane ( d) z- fig.1 plane ( r) performed following equation: z = ln 2i . (2.30) maps annulus cut along positive axis rectangle .the cut could avoided convert rectangle r cylinder height b (by identifying  ).the periodicity explicitly seen rewriting eq.(2.30) form = exp(cid:18)2iz (cid:19) (2.31) ,obviously,(z) = (z + a). combining eqs.(2.26) (2.30) obtain, m( d) = 1 2 r(cid:19) ln(cid:18)1 .using eq.(2.27) obtain, 1 2 ln(cid:0) 1 r(cid:1) = b a( d) a2m , (2.32) (2.33) coincides exactly result (2.19) anticipated.we shall need also use results annulus curve c connects inner circle c1 outer circle c2 .simple calculation shows l2() a() 1 2 r1(cid:19) . ln(cid:18)r2 if,as before,we choose r2 = 1 r1 = r ,then obtain , = b , 2 ln(cid:0) 1 r(cid:1) = 10 (2.35) (2.36) ,as before, a( d) b2 = ab. duality results (2.23) (2.36) happens important shall demonstrate section 4. meantime,we need introduce concept quadratic dierential.this accomplished next section. 3 essentials quadratic dieren- tials let us begin eq.(2.31).using equation obtain following se- quence results = 2i dz dz = 2i (dz)2 = a2 (d)2 (2)2 2 (3.1) last expression represents rst example quadratic dieren- tial.more formaly,we provide following denition 3.1. let z = f (z) coformal mapping domain onto let (z) function wich transforms dz(cid:19)2 (z) = (z)(cid:18)dz , z = f (z), (3.2) expression (z) (dz)2 called quadratic dierential. (3.2) follows,that quantity invariant respect map- pings :z z ,i.e. (z) (dz)2 = (z) (dz)2 . (3.3) eq.(3.1) represents example general result given eq.(3.3).comparison eq.s(2.28) (3.3) suggests us introduce denition 3.2. dierential |dw| = |(z)| remark 3.3.a)in terms element ( length) associated . 1 2 |dz| called lenght |dw| length usual euclidean 2 association 1 length ;b)(z) identied ,in principle, |(z)| actualy formal shall explain , section 4 . discussion follows,in particular,that 1 (dw)2 = (z) (dz)2 11 (3.4) suppose,that another w 1 (d w)2 = (z) (dz)2 . (3.5) then,clearly, w = w + const. moreover,by taking square root eq.(3.4) obtain, here,we obtain well dw dz w = (z) = zz dzp(z) . =p(z). (3.6) (3.7) dierential equation complex plane riemann surface,etc. ow lines equation used extensively part work.now ,we would like provide additional details. purpose ,let us consider quadratic dierential type (dw)2 =(cid:18)n + 2 2 (cid:19)2 zn (dz)2 (3.8) n integer (n 1). use eq.(3.6) provides us result, w = (z) = z n+2 2 , dw dz 2 (cid:19) z =(cid:18)n + 2 n 2 . (3.9) (3.10) eq.(3.9) typical example conformal mapping.for mapping ,with respect origin z-plane, whole z-plane subdivided sectors (n 1) 2 n + 2 k arg z 2 n + 2 (k + 1), k = 0, 1, ..., n + 1, (3.11) arg z covers one sectors,the resulting image cov- ers either upper lower w-plane.if consider set par- allel lines(parallel w axis w-plane), im w = an, = const, n = 12 0, 1, 2, ...,these parallel lines go parallel lines one sectors z-plane y-type singularity obtain result depicted fig.2.in case thorn ,n=-1 ,and mapping whole fig.2 z-plane (with cut along x 0 axis) upper w-plane. horizontals w-plane go horizontals z-plane depicted fig.3.straightening fig.3 ow lines explains reason word measured foliations intro- duced part i(e.g.see fig.21 part i).from examples previous section follows ,that singularities producing poles order >2 acceptable since identify |(z)| 2(z),then area,eq.(2.11), be- comes divergent.this means,in particular,that singularities depicted fig.4 known literature liquid crystals mathematicaly ill-dened(see also next section additional details).the singularities fig.4 n > 1 permissible,in principle, could considered along lines similar discussed part (see ref. section 6 below). mathematically permissible quadratic dierentials brought standard form follows.consider mapping (z) = exp(cid:18)2i l (z)(cid:19) . (3.12) analogous eq.(2.31) l length quadratic dierential (z). analogy eq.(3.1) ,we = 2i l p(z)dz (z) (dz)2 = l2 (2)2 (d)2 2 (3.13) ow lines dened quadratic dierential concentric cir- cles (fig.4 ,part i).this important result since allows map arbitrary mathematicaly permissible quadratic dierential standard dierential,eq.(3.1) (or (3.13)),so rest arguments related annulus rectangle presented section 2 could carried without change. results broadly generalized now.to purpose let us take another look eq.(3.12).what actually mapping riemann surface r quadratic dierential lives surface annulus.clearly,such mapping limitations.that , might well mapping exist ring domain |z| = r .the size domain determines size annulus (or punctured disk).without going intricate details correspondence thee domainswe provide 13 theorem 3.4.if quadratic dierential closed trajec- tories r respective lengths li ,then characteristic ring domains (i.e.the maximal ring domains swept closed trajectories cover r set measure zero.for holomorphic quadratic dierential compact surface genus g 2 number characteristic ring domains 3g-3. proof.please,consult refs..
