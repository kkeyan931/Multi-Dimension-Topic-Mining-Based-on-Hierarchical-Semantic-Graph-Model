introduction

this paper gives a complete selfcontained proof of our result announced in
[6] showing that renormalization in quantum eld theory is a special instance
of a general mathematical procedure of extraction of nite values based on
the riemann-hilbert problem. in order that the paper be readable by non-
specialists we shall begin by giving a short introduction to both topics of
renormalization and of the riemann-hilbert problem, with our apologies to
specialists in both camps for recalling well-known material.

perturbative renormalization is by far the most successful technique for
it is well known
computing physical quantities in quantum eld theory.
for instance that it accurately predicts the rst ten decimal places of the
anomalous magnetic moment of the electron.

the physical motivation behind the renormalization technique is quite clear
and goes back to the concept of eective mass in nineteen century hydrody-
namics. thus for instance when applying newtons law,

(1)

f = m a

to the motion of a spherical rigid balloon b, the inertial mass m is not the
mass m0 of b but is modied to

(2)

m = m0 + 1

2 m

where m is the mass of the volume of air occupied by b.

it follows for instance that the initial acceleration a of b is given, using the
archimedean law, by

m g =(cid:16)m0 + 1

2 m(cid:17) a

(3)

and is always of magnitude less than 2g.
the additional inertial mass  m = m  m0 is due to the interaction of b
with the surounding eld of air and if this interaction could not be turned
o there would be no way to measure the mass m0.
the analogy between hydrodynamics and electromagnetism led (through
the work of thomson, lorentz, kramers. . . [10]) to the crucial distinction
between the bare parameters, such as m0, which enter the eld theoretic
equations, and the observed parameters, such as the inertial mass m.

2

a quantum eld theory in d = 4 dimensions, is given by a classical action
functional,

(4)

s (a) =z l (a) d4x

where a is a classical eld and the lagrangian is of the form,

(5)

l (a) = (a)2/2 

m2
2

a2 + lint(a)

where lint(a) is usually a polynomial in a and possibly its derivatives.
one way to describe the quantum elds (x), is by means of the time ordered
greens functions,

(6)

gn (x1, . . . , xn ) = h 0|t (x1) . . . (xn )| 0i

where the time ordering symbol t means that the (xj)s are written in
order of increasing time from right to left.
the probability amplitude of a classical eld conguration a is given by,

(7)

ei s(a)

h

and if one could ignore the renormalization problem, the greens functions
would be computed as,

(8)

gn (x1, . . . , xn ) = nz ei s(a)

h a(x1) . . . a(xn ) [da]

where n is a normalization factor required to ensure the normalization of
the vacuum state,

(9)

h 0 | 0i = 1 .

it is customary to denote by the same symbol the quantum eld (x) appear-
ing in (6) and the classical eld a(x) appearing in the functional integral.
no confusion arises from this abuse of notation.

if one could ignore renormalization, the functional integral (8) would be easy
to compute in perturbation theory, i.e. by treating the term lint in (5) as a
perturbation of

(10)

l0() = ()2/2 

m2
2

2 .

with obvious notations the action functional splits as

(11)

s() = s0() + sint()

where the free action s0 generates a gaussian measure exp (i s0()) [d] =
d.

the series expansion of the greens functions is then given in terms of gaus-
sian integrals of polynomials as,

gn (x1, . . . , xn ) =  xn=0
  xn=0

in/n!z (x1) . . . (xn ) (sint())n d!
in/n!z sint()n d!1

.

(12)

the various terms of this expansion are computed using integration by parts
under the gaussian measure . this generates a large number of terms
u (), each being labelled by a feynman graph , and having a numerical
value u () obtained as a multiple integral in a nite number of space-time
variables. we shall come back later in much detail to the precise deni-
tion of feynman graphs and of the corresponding integrals. but we now
know enough to formulate the problem of renormalization. as a rule the
unrenormalized values u () are given by nonsensical divergent integrals.
the conceptually really nasty divergences are called ultraviolet1 and are
associated to the presence of arbitrarily large frequencies or equivalently
to the unboundedness of momentum space on which integration has to be
carried out. equivalently, when one attempts to integrate in coordinate
space, one confronts divergences along diagonals, reecting the fact that
products of eld operators are dened only on the conguration space of
distinct spacetime points.
the physics resolution of this problem is obtained by rst introducing a
cut-o in momentum space (or any suitable regularization procedure) and
then by cleverly making use of the unobservability of the bare parameters,
such as the bare mass m0. by adjusting, term by term of the perturbative
expansion, the dependence of the bare parameters on the cut-o parameter,

1the challenge posed by the infrared problem is formidable though. asymptotic expan-
sions in its presence quite generally involve decompositions of singular expression similar
to the methods underlying renormalization theory. one can reasonably hope that in the
future singular asymptotic expansions will be approachable by the methods advocated
here.

4

it is possible for a large class of theories, called renormalizable, to eliminate
the unwanted ultraviolet divergences. this resolution of divergences can
actually be carried out at the level of integrands, with suitable derivatives
with respect to external momenta, which is the celebrated bphz approach
to the problem.
the soundness of this physics resolution of the problem makes it doubtful
at rst sight that it could be tied up to central parts of mathematics.
it was recognized quite long ago [11] that distribution theory together with
locality were providing a satisfactory formal approach to the problem when
formulated in conguration space, in terms of the singularities of (6) at coin-
ciding points, formulating the bphz recursion in conguration space. the
mathematical program of constructive quantum eld theory [13] was rst
completed for superrenormalizable models, making contact with the deep-
est parts of hard classical analysis through the phase space localization and
renormalization group methods. this led to the actual rigorous mathemat-
ical construction of renormalizable models such as the gross-neveu model
in 2-dimensions [12]. the discovery of asymptotic freedom, which allows
to guess the asymptotic expansion of the bare parameters in terms of the
cut-o leads to the partially fullled hope that the rigorous contruction can
be completed for physically important theories such as qcd.
however neither of these important progresses does shed light on the ac-
tual complicated combinatorics which has been successfully used by particle
physicists for many decades to extract nite results from divergent feynman
graphs, and which is the essence of the experimentally conrmed predictive
power of quantum eld theory.
we shall ll this gap in the present paper by unveiling the true nature of
this seemingly complicated combinatorics and by showing that it is a special
case of a general extraction of nite values based on the riemann-hilbert
problem.
our result was announced in [6] and relies on several previous papers [7, 16,
17, 18, 4] but we shall give below a complete account of its proof.
the riemann-hilbert problem comes from hilberts 21st problem which he
formulated as follows:

prove that there always exists a fuchsian linear dierential equation
with given singularities and given monodromy.

in this form it admits a positive answer due to plemelj and birkho (cf. [1]
for a careful exposition). when formulated in terms of linear systems of the

5

form,

(13)

y(z) = a(z) y(z) , a(z) = xs

a 
z  

,

where s is the given nite set of singularities,  6 s, the a are complex
matrices such that

(14)

x a = 0

to avoid singularities at , the answer is not always positive [2], but the
solution exists when the monodromy matrices m (g.1) are suciently
close to 1. it can then be explicitly written as a series of polylogarithms
[19].

figure 1

another formulation of the riemann-hilbert problem, intimately tied up
to the classication of holomorphic vector bundles on the riemann sphere
p1(c), is in terms of the birkho decomposition

(15)

 (z) = (z)1 +(z)

z  c

where we let c  p1(c) be a smooth simple curve, c the component of
the complement of c containing  6 c and c+ the other component. both
 and  are loops with values in gln(c),

(16)

 (z)  g = gln(c)

 z  c

and  are boundary values of holomorphic maps (still denoted by the same
symbol)

(17)

 : c  gln(c) .

the normalization condition () = 1 ensures that, if it exists, the de-
composition (15) is unique (under suitable regularity conditions).

the existence of the birkho decomposition (15) is equivalent to the van-
ishing,

(18)

c1 (lj) = 0

of the chern numbers nj = c1 (lj) of the holomorphic line bundles of the
birkho-grothendieck decomposition,

(19)

e =  lj

where e is the holomorphic vector bundle on p1(c) associated to , i.e. with
total space:

(20)

(c+  cn)  (c  cn) .

the above discussion for g = gln(c) extends to arbitrary complex lie
groups.

when g is a simply connected nilpotent complex lie group the existence
(and uniqueness) of the birkho decomposition (15) is valid for any . when
the loop  : c  g extends to a holomorphic loop: c+  g, the birkho
in general, for z  c+ the
decomposition is given by + = ,  = 1.
evaluation,

(21)

is a natural principle to extract a nite value from the singular expression
(z). this extraction of nite values coincides with the removal of the pole
part when g is the additive group c of complex numbers and the loop  is
meromorphic inside c+ with z as its only singularity.
we shall rst show that for any quantum eld theory, the combinatorics of
feynman graphs gives rise to a hopf algebra h which is commutative as
an algebra. it is the dual hopf algebra of the envelopping algebra of a lie
algebra g whose basis is labelled by the one particle irreducible feynman
graphs. the lie bracket of two such graphs is computed from insertions of
one graph in the other and vice versa. the corresponding lie group g is
the group of characters of h.
we shall then show that, using dimensional regularization, the bare (un-
renormalized) theory gives rise to a loop

our main result is that the renormalized theory is just the evaluation at
z = d of the holomorphic part + of the birkho decomposition of .
we begin to analyse the group g and show that it is a semi-direct product
of an easily understood abelian group by a highly non-trivial group closely
tied up with groups of dieomorphisms. the analysis of this latter group
as well as the interpretation of the renormalization group and of anomalous
dimensions are the content of our second paper with the same overall title
[8].

2 the hopf algebra of feynman graphs

the hopf algebra structure of perturbative quantum eld theory is by now
well established [7, 16, 17, 18, 4]. to the practitioner its most exciting aspect
is arguably that it is represented as a hopf algebra of decorated rooted trees
[7, 18, 4] or, equivalently, as a hopf algebra of parenthesized words on an
alphabet provided by the skeleton expansion of the theory [16]. the relation
to rooted trees exhibits most clearly the combinatorics imposed on feynman
graphs so that overlapping subdivergences can be resolved to deliver local
counterterms [17]. the hopf algebra structure can be directly formulated on
graphs though [17, 4]. it is this latter representation to which we will turn
here, to make the contact with the notation of collins textbook as close as
possible.

feynman graphs  are combinatorial labels for the terms of the expansion
(12) of greens functions in a given quantum eld theory. they are graphs
consisting of vertices joined by lines. the vertices are of dierent kinds
corresponding to terms in the lagrangian of the theory.

we shall require that the theory we start with is renormalizable and include
all corresponding vertices in the diagrams.

8

thus, and if we start, for notational simplicity,2 with 3 in d = 6 dimen-
sions, we shall have three kinds of vertices:3

the three line vertex

corresponding to the 3 term of the lagrangian;

the two line vertex

the two line vertex
grangian.

corresponding to the 2 term of the lagrangian;

corresponding to the ( )2 term of the la-

in general the number of lines attached to a vertex is the degree of the
corresponding monomial in the lagrangian of the theory. a line joining two
vertices is called internal. the others are attached to only one vertex and are
called external. to specify a feynman graph one needs to specify the values
of parameters which label the external lines. when working in conguration
space these would just be the space-time points xj of (12) associated to
the corresponding external vertices (i.e. those vertices attached to external
lines). it will be more practical to work in momentum space and to specify
the external parameters of a diagram in terms of external momenta.
it
is customary to orient the momenta carried by external lines so that they
all go inward. the law of conservation of momentum means that for each
connected graph ,

we shall use the following notation to indicate specic external structures of
a graph . we let (0) be the graph with all its external momenta nullied,
i.e.

2our results extend in a straightforward manner to any theory renormalizable by local

counterterms.

3in the case of a massless theory, there will be only two kinds, as the two-line vertex

corresponding to the 2 term is missing.

of p is irrelevant in (2). this notation might seem confusing at rst sight
but becomes clear if one thinks of the external structure of graphs in terms
of distributions. this is necessary to have space-time parameters xj on the
same footing as the momentum parameters pj using fourier transform. we
shall return to this point in greater detail after the proof of theorem 1.

a feynman graph  is called one particle irreducible (1pi) if it is connected
and cannot be disconnected by removing a single line. the following graph
is one particle reducible:

we let 
(i) be the feynman graph with  as set of internal lines,  () as
external lines, and external structure given by nullied external momenta
for i = 0 and by (2) if i = 1.
in the sum (6) the multi index i has one value for each connected component

lets (i) be the product of the graphs 
(i) corresponding to the connected
components of . the graph /(i) is obtained by replacing each of the
connected components  of  by the corresponding vertex, with the same
(i).9 the sum (6) is over all values of the multi index i. it is

by construction, the 1pi graphs

can have common external legs  ()   () 6= .

example (9) shows what happens in general for graphs with no subgraph
fullling (7), i.e. graphs without subdivergences. example (10) shows an
example of overlapping subdivergences. example (11) also, but it illustrates
an important general feature of the coproduct () for  a 1pi graph,
namely that ()  hh(1) where h(1) is the subspace of h generated by
1 and the 1pi graphs. similar examples were given in [7, 17].
the coproduct  dened by (6) on 1pi graphs extends uniquely to a homo-
morphism from h to h  h. the main result of this section is ([16, 17]):
theorem 1. the pair (h, ) is a hopf algebra.
proof. our rst task will be to prove that  is coassociative, i.e. that,

(13)

(  id)  = (id  )  .

12

d

since both sides of (13) are algebra homomorphisms from h to h  h  h,
it will be enough to check that they give the same result on 1pi graphs .
thus we x the 1pi graph  and let h be the linear subspace of h spanned
by 1pi graphs with the same external structure as . also we let hc be the
subalgebra of h generated by the 1pi graphs  with two or three external
legs and with external structure of type (i), i = 0, 1. one has by (6) that

(  id)       1 = x

where  =  is allowed now in the summation of the right hand side.
we need a nice formula for  (i) which is dened as

where the subset  of the set (1) of internal lines of  is now allowed to
be empty (which gives 1  ) or full (which gives   1). of course the
sum (19) is restricted to  such that each component is 1pi and satises
(7) relative to  = j
(ij ). but this is equivalent to fullling (7) relative to

(20)

() = () .

13

indeed since  is a subgraph of  one has ()  () but every line
  () is a line of  which meets (1) and hence belongs to  which
gives equality.
the equality (20) also shows that the symbol 
(k) in (19) can be taken
relative to the full graph . we can now combine (17) (18) and (19) to
write the following formula:

where both  and  are subsets of the set of internal lines (1) of  and
 is a subset of . both  and  satisfy (7). since  is not necessarily
connected we need to dene the symbol (i)/
(k) as the replacement in the
not necessarily connected graph (i) of each of the component of  by the
corresponding vertex. the only point to remember is that if a component
of  is equal to a component of  the corresponding index kj is equal to ij
(following (19)) and the corresponding term in / is equal to 1.

to prove that the sums (21) and (25) are equal it is enough to prove that

let us show that the map  which associates to every admissible subset  of

since each connected component of  is contained in a connected component
of , we see that  () is admissible in . note that when a connected
component 0 of  is equal to a connected component of  its image in 
is dened to be empty. for the components of  which are not components

(k) by those components of

the inverse of the map  is obtained as follows. given  an admissible
subset of , one associates to each component of  its inverse image by 
which gives a component of . moreover to each vertex v of  which does
not belong to  but which came from the contraction of a component of
, one associates this component as a new component of . it is clear then
that    6=  and that  is admissible in  with  () = .

15

to prove (27) we can thus x  and  =  (). for those components of
 equal to components of  the index i0 is necessarily equal to k0 so they
contribute in the same way to both sides of (27). for the other components
there is freedom in the choice of i0 or j0 but using (29) the two contribu-
tions to (27) are also equal. this ends the proof of the coassociativity of
the coproduct  and it remains to show that the bialgebra h admits an
antipode.

this can be easily proved by induction but it is worthwile to discuss various
gradings of the hopf algebra h associated to natural combinatorial features
of the graphs. any such grading will associate an integer n ()  z to each
1pi graph, the corresponding grading of the algebra h is then given by
(30)

deg (1) = 0

deg (1 . . . e) =x n (j) ,

and the only interesting property is the compatibility with the coproduct
which means, using (6), that

(31)

deg () + deg (/) = deg ()

for any admissible .

the rst two natural gradings are given by

(32)

and

(33)

i () = number of internal lines in 

v () = v ()  1 = number of vertices of   1 .

an important combination of these two gradings is

(34)

l = i  v = i  v + 1

which is the loop number of the graph or equivalently the rank of its rst
homology group. it governs the power of h which appears in the evaluation
of the graph.

note that the number of external lines of a graph is not a good grading
since it fails to fulll (31). for any of the three gradings i, v, l one has the
following further compatibility with the hopf algebra structure of h,
lemma. a) the scalars are the only homogeneous elements of degree 0.

proof. a) since the diagram
v () = 0 is excluded. also if l () = 0 the  is a tree but a tree diagram
cannot be 1pi unless it is equal to

b) since x is a linear combination of homogeneous monomials it is enough
to prove b) for  i and in fact for 1pi graphs . using (6) it is enough
to check that the degree of a non empty  is strictly positive, which follows
from a).

we can now end the proof of theorem 1 and give an inductive formula for
the antipode s.
the counit e is given as a character of h by
(35)

e (1) = 1 , e () = 0

  6=  .

the dening equation for the antipode is,

(36)

m (s  id)  (a) = e (a) 1

 a  h

and its existence is obtained by induction using the formula,

(37)

s (x) = x x s (x ) x 

for any non scalar homogeneous x  h using the notations of lemma 2.
this antipode also fullls the other required identity [7, 16],

m (id  s)  (a) =  (a) 1

 a  h.

this completes the proof of theorem 1.

let us now be more specic about the external structure of diagrams. given
a 1pi graph, with n external legs labelled by i  {1, . . . , n} we specify its
external structure by giving a distribution  dened on a suitable test space
s of smooth functions on
(38)

n(pi)i=1,...,n ; x pi = 0o = en .

17

thus  is a continuous linear map,

(39)

 : s (e)  c .

to a graph  with external structure  we have associated above an element
of the hopf algebra h and we require the linearity of this map, i.e.
(40)

(,11+22) = 1 (,1) + 2 (,2) .

one can easily check that this relation is compatible with the coproduct.
there is considerable freedom in the choice of the external structure of
the 1pi graphs which occur in the left hand side of the last term of the
coproduct formula (6). we wrote the proof of theorem 1 in such a way that
this freedom is apparent. the only thing which matters is that, say for self
energy graphs, the distributions 0 and 1 satisfy,

(41)

0 (a m2 + b p2) = a , 1 (a m2 + b p2) = b ,

where p = p1 is the natural coordinate on e2 and m is a mass parameter.
this freedom in the denition of the hopf algebra h is the same as the
freedom in the choice of parametrization of the corresponding qft and it is
important to make full use of it, for instance for massless theories in which
the above choice of nullied external momenta is not appropriate and one
would rely only on 1(bp2) = b.
for simplicity of exposition we shall keep the above choice, the generalization
being obvious.
we shall now apply the milnor-moore theorem to the bigraded hopf algebra
h. the two natural gradings are v and l, the grading i is just their sum.
this theorem rst gives a lie algebra structure on the linear space,

(42)

m s (e) = l

where for each 1pi graph , we let s (e) be the test space associated to
the external lines of  as in (38). given x  l we consider the linear form
zx on h given, on the monomials , by
(43)

h, zxi = 0
unless  is a (connected) 1pi, in which case,

(44)

h, zxi = h, xi

18

where  is the distribution giving the external structure of  and where x
is the corresponding component of x. by construction zx is an innitesimal
character of h and the same property holds for the commutator,
(45)

[zx1 , zx2] = zx1 zx2  zx2 zx1

where the product in the right hand side is given by the coproduct of h, i.e.
by

(46)

hz1 z2, i = hz1  z2,  i .

the computation of the lie bracket is straightforward as in [9] p. 207 or [7]
and is given as follows. one lets j, j = 1, 2 be 1pi graphs and j  s (ej )
corresponding test functions.
for i  {0, 1}, we let ni (1, 2; ) be the number of subgraphs of  which
are isomorphic to 1 while

(47)

/1(i)  2 .

we let (, ) be the element of l associated to   s (e), the lie bracket
of (1, 1) and (2, 2) is then,
(48) x,i

i (1) ni (1, 2; ) (, 2)  i (2) ni (2, 1; ) (, 1) .

what is obvious in this formula is that it vanishes if i (j ) = 0 and hence
we let l0 be the subspace of l given by,

(49)

l0 =  s (e)0 , s (e)0 = {; i () = 0 , i = 0, 1} .

it is by construction a subspace of nite codimension in each of the s (e).
we need a natural supplement and in view of (41) we should choose the
obvious test functions,

(50)

0 (p) = m2, 1 (p) = p2 .

we shall thus, for any 1pi self energy graph, let

(51)

((i)) = (, i) .

similarly for a vertex graph with the constant function 1. one checks using
(48) that the (i) for 1pi graphs with two or three external legs, do generate
a lie subalgebra

(52)

lc =nx  ((i))o .

19

we can now state the following simple fact,

[, ] =xv

 v 

theorem 2. the lie algebra l is the semi-direct product of l0 by lc. the
lie algebra l0 is abelian, while lc has a canonical basis labelled by the (i)
and such that

 v  xv
where  v  is obtained by grafting  on  at v.
proof. using (48) it is clear that l0 is an abelian lie subalgebra of l. the
lie bracket of ((i))  lc with (, )  l0 is given by
(53)

x ni ((i), ; ) (, )

which belongs to l0 so that [lc, l0]  l0.
to simplify the lie bracket of the ((i)) in lc we introduce the new basis,

(54)

(i) = s () ()

where s () is the symmetry factor of a feynman graph, i.e. the cardinality
of its group of automorphisms. in other words if another graph  is isomor-
phic to  there are exactly s () such isomorphisms. from the denition
(47) of ni (1, 2; ) we see that s (1) s (2) ni (1, 2; ) is the number of
pairs j1, j2 of an embedding

(55)

and of an isomorphism

j1 : 1  

(56)

j2 : 2  /1 (i) .

giving such a pair is the same as giving a vertex v of type (i) of 2 and an
isomorphism,

(57)

j : 2 v 1   .

since there are s () such isomorphisms when   2 v 1 we get the
formula of theorem 2 using (48).

it is clear from theorem 2 that the lie algebra lc is independent of the
choice of the distributions j fullling (41). the same remark applies to l
using (53).

20

by the milnor-moore theorem the hopf algebra h is the dual of the en-
velopping algebra u (l). the linear subspace h(1) of h spanned by 1 and
the 1pi graphs give a natural system of ane coordinates on the group g
of characters of h, i.e. of homomorphisms,
(58)

 : h  c ,  (xy ) =  (x)  (y )

 x, y  h

from the algebra h to complex numbers.
we shall only consider homomorphisms which are continuous with respect
to the distributions labelling the external stucture of graphs.
the group operation in g is given by the convolution,

(59)

(1  2) (x) = h1  2,  xi

 x  h .

the hopf subalgebra hc of h generated by the 1pi with two or three external
legs and external structure given by the i, is the dual of the envelopping
algebra u (lc) and we let gc be the group of characters of hc.
the map   /hc denes a group homomorphism,
(60)

 : g  gc

and as in theorem 2 one has,

proposition 3. the kernel g0 of  is abelian and g is the semi-direct
product g = g0 > gc of g0 by the action of gc.
proof. a character  of h belongs to g0 i its restriction to hc is the
augmentation map. this just means that for any 1pi graph  one has
 ((i)) = 0. thus the convolution of two characters j  g0 is just given
by,

(61)

(1  2) () = 1 () + 2 ()

for any 1pi graph . this determines the character 1 2 uniquely, so that
1  2 = 2  1.
let us now construct a section  : gc  g which is a homomorphism. we
just need to construct a homomorphism,

(62)

from characters of hc to characters of h, such that
(63)

  e =   
e/hc =  .

21

it is enough to extend  to all 1pi graphs (, ) where  is the external

structure, this then determines e uniquely as a character and one just has

to check that,

(64)

(1  2)e = e1  e2 .

we let e (, ) = 0 for any 1pi graph with n 6= 2, 3 external legs or any 1pi

graph with 2 or 3 external legs such that,

(65)

 ((p2)i) = 0

i = 0, 1

if n = 2 ,

i = 0 if n = 3 .

(66)

uniquely.

to check (64) it is enough to test both sides on 1pi graphs (, ). one uses
(6) to get,

by (41) this gives a natural supplement of hc(1) in h(1) and determines e
(e1  e2) (, ) = e1 (, ) + e2 (, ) +x 1 ((i)) e2 (/(i), ) .
for any (, ) in the above supplement of hc(1) the right hand side clearly
vanishes. the same holds for (1  2)e (, ) by construction. for any
(, i)  hc(1) one simply gets the formula for (1  2) (, i) = (1 
2)e (, i). this gives (64). we have thus proved that  is a surjective ho-
momorphism from g to gc and that  : gc  g is a group homomorphism
such that

(67)

   = idgc .

let us now compute explicitly the action of gc on g0 given by inner

automorphisms,

(68)

one has

(69)

.

1

 (1)  = e1    e1
(  e1

1 ) (, ) =  (, )

for any (, ) in the supplement of hc(1) in h(1). thus,
(70)

 (1) () (, ) =  (, ) +x 1 ((i))  (/(i), ) .

22

this formula shows that the action of gc on g0 is just a linear representation
of gc on the vector group g0.

a few remarks are in order. first of all, the hopf algebra of feynman graphs
as presented in [17] is the same as hc. as we have seen in theorem 2 and
proposition 3, the only nontrivial part in the hopf algebra h is hc. for
instance, the birkho decomposition of a loop (z)  g, is readily obtained
from the birkho decomposition of its homomorphic image, c(z)  gc
since the latter allows to move back to a loop 0(z)  g0 with g0 abelian.
dealing with the hopf algebra h allows however to treat oversubtractions
and operator product expansions in an eective manner.

second, one should point out that there is a deep relation between the hopf
algebra hc and the hopf algebra of rooted trees [7, 16, 17]. this is es-
sential for the practitioner of qft [4]. the relation was rst established
using the particular structures imposed on the perturbation series by the
schwinger-dyson equation [16]. alternative reformulations of this hopf al-
gebra conrmed this relation [15] in full agreement with the general analysis
of [17].
a full description of the relation between the hopf algebras of graphs and
of rooted trees in the language established here will be given in the second
part of this paper [8].

3 renormalization and the birkho decomposi-

tion

we shall show that given a renormalizable quantum eld theory in d space-
time dimensions, the bare theory gives rise, using dimensional regularization,
to a loop  of elements in the group g associated to the theory in section
2. the parameter z of the loop  (z) is a complex variable and  (z) makes
sense for z 6= d in a neighborhood of d, and in particular on a small circle
c centered at z = d. our main result is that the renormalized theory is
just the evaluation at z = d of the holomorphic piece + in the birkho
decomposition,

(1)

 (z) =  (z)1 + (z)

of the loop  as a product of two holomorphic maps  from the respective
components c of the complement of the circle c in the riemann sphere
c p 1. as in section 2 we shall, for simplicity, deal with 3 theory in d = 6

23

dimensions since it exhibits all the important general diculties of renor-
malizable theories which are relevant here.

the loop  (z) is obtained by applying dimensional regularization (dim.
reg.) in the evaluation of the bare values of feynman graphs , and our
rst task is to recall the feynman rules which associate an integral

(2)

u (p1, . . . , pn ) =z dd k1 . . . dd kl i (p1, . . . , pn , k1, . . . , kl)

to every graph .

for convenience we shall formulate the feynman rules in euclidean space-
time to eliminate irrelevant singularities on the mass shell and powers of

i = 1. in order to write these rules directly in d space-time dimensions

it is important ([14]) to introduce a unit of mass  and to replace the coupling
constant g which appears in the lagrangian as the coecient of 3/3! by
3d/2 g. the eect then is that g is dimensionless for any value of d since
the dimension of the eld  is d
the integrand i (p1, . . . , pn , k1, . . . , kl) contains l internal momenta kj,
where l is the loop number of the graph , and results from the following
rules,

2  1 in a d-dimensional space-time.

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

assign a factor

1

k2+m2 to each internal line.

assign a momentum conservation rule to each vertex.

assign a factor 3d/2 g to each 3-point vertex.

assign a factor m2 to each 2-point vertex(0).

assign a factor p2 to each 2-point vertex(1).

again, the 2-point vertex(0) does not appear in the case of a massless theory.
there is moreover an overall normalization factor which depends upon the
conventions for the choice of the haar measure in d-dimensional space. we
shall normalize the haar measure so that,

(8)

z dd p exp (p2) = d/2 .

24

this introduces an overall factor of (2)dl where l is the loop number of
the graph, i.e. the number of internal momenta.
the integral (2) makes sense using the rules of dimensional regularization
(cf. [5] chap. 4) provided the complex number d is in a neighborhood of
d = 6 and d 6= d.
if we let  be the external momenta structure of the graph  we would like
to dene the bare value u () simply by evaluating  on the test function
(2) but we have to take care of two requirements. first we want u () to
be a pure number, i.e. to be a dimensionless quantity. in order to achieve
this we simply multiply h, ui by the appropriate power of  to make it
dimensionless.
the second requirement is that, for a graph with n external legs we should
divide by gn 2 where g is the coupling constant.
we shall thus let:

(9)

u () = g(2n ) b h, ui

where b = b (d) is the dimension of h, ui.
using (3)-(7) this dimension is easy to compute. one can remove all 2-
point vertices from the graph  without changing the dimension of u since
removing such a vertex removes an internal line and a factor (6), (7) which
by (3) does not alter the dimension. thus let us assume that all vertices of 
are 3-point vertices. each of them contributes by (3 d/2) to the dimension
and each internal line by 2, and each loop by d (because of the integration
on the corresponding momenta). this gives

(10)

dim (u) =(cid:18)3 

d

2(cid:19) v  2 i + d l .

one has l = i  v + 1, so the coecient of d in (10) is i  3
2 v + 1 = 1 n
2 .
(the equality n = 3 v  2 i follows by considering the set of pairs (x, y)
where x  (0) is a vertex, y  (1) is an internal line and x  y.) the
constant term is 3 v  2 i = n thus,
dim (u) =(cid:18)1 
(11)
b =(cid:18)1 

2(cid:19) d + n .
2(cid:19) d + n + dim  .

we thus get,

(12)

n

n

25

thus (11) and (12) are valid for arbitrary 1pi graphs (connected) since both
sides are unchanged by the removal of all two point vertices.
to understand the factor g2n in (9) let us show that the integer valued
function,

(13)

order  = v3  (n  2)

where v3 is the number of 3-point vertices of the 1pi connected graph ,
and n the number of its external lines, does dene a grading in the sense
of (31) section 2. we need to check that,

(14)

order () + order (/) = order 

using the notations of section 2, with  connected. if  is a self energy graph
one has order  = v3 which is the number of 3-point vertices removed from
 in passing to /, thus (14) follows. if  is a vertex graph, then order
 = v3  1 which is again the number of 3-point vertices removed from 
in passing to / since  is replaced by a 3-point vertex in this operation.
thus (14) holds in all cases.

thus we see that the reason for the convention for powers of g in (9) is to
ensure that u () is a monomial of degree order () in g.
we extend the denition (9) to disjoint unions of 1pi graphs j by,

(15)

u ( =  j) =  u (j) .

one can of course write simple formulas involving the number of external
legs and the number of connected components of  to compare u () with
h, ui as in (9).
before we state the main result of this paper in the form of theorem 4
below let us rst recall that if it were not for the divergences occuring at
d = d, one could give perturbative formulas for all the important physical
observables of the qft in terms of sums over feynman graphs.
it is of
course a trivial matter to rewrite the result in terms of the u () dened
above and we shall just give a few illustrative examples.

the simplest example is the eective potential which is an ordinary function,

(16)

c  v (c)

of one variable traditionally noted c.

26

the nth derivative v (n) (0) is just given as the sum, with s () the symmetry
factor of ,

(17)

v (n) (0) =x

1/s ()h0, ui

where 0 is evaluation at 0 external momenta, and where  varies through all
1pi graphs with n external momenta and only 3-point interaction vertices.10
we thus get

(18)

v (n) (0) = gn2 nd ( n

2 1)x

1

s ()

u ()

but this expression is meaningless at d = d which is the case of interest.
if instead of evaluating at 0 external momenta one keeps the dependence on
p1, . . . , pn one obtains the expression for the eective action,

(19)

 =xn

1

n! z dd x1 . . . dd xn (n)(x1, . . . , xn) c(x1) . . . c(xn)

where (n) (p1, . . . , pn) is given by (18) evaluated at external momenta given
by the pjs.
for expressions which involve connected diagrams which are not 1pi, such
as the connected greens functions one just needs to express the bare value
of a graph u (p1, . . . , pn ) in terms of the bare values of the 1pi compo-
nents which drop out when removing internal lines which carry a xed value
(depending only on p1, . . . , pn ) for their momenta.

k

q

p

p

p

p + k 

p + q

in this example we get u (p,p) = u1(p,p) u2(p,p) where j is the
one loop self energy graph.
similarly for expressions such as the greens functions which involve dia-
grams which are not connected one simply uses the equality

(20)

u1  2 = u1 u2

10the reader should not forget that we committed ourselves to an euclidean metric,
so that appropriate wick rotations are necessary to compare with results obtained in
minkowski space.

27

where 1  2 is the disjoint union of 1 and 2. in all cases the graphs
involved are only those with 3-point interaction vertices and the obtained
expressions only contain nitely many terms of a given order in terms of the
grading (13). if it were not for the divergences at d = d they would be the
physical meaningful candidates for an asymptotic expansion in terms of g
for the value of the observable.
let us now state our main result:
theorem 4. a) there exists a unique loop (z)  g, z  c, |z  d| < 1,
z 6= d whose -coordinates are given by u ()d=z.
b) the renormalized value of a physical observable o is obtained by replacing
 (d) in the perturbative expansion of o by + (d) where

 (z) =  (z)1 + (z)

is the birkho decomposition of the loop  (z) on any circle with center d
and radius < 1.

proof. to specify the renormalization we use the graph by graph method [3]
using dimensional regularization and the minimal substraction scheme. we
just need to concentrate on the renormalization of 1pi graphs . we shall
use the notations of [5] to make the proof more readable. our rst task will
be to express the bogoliubov, parasiuk and hepp recursive construction of
the counterterms   c () and of the renormalized values of the graphs
  r (), in terms of the hopf algebra h.
we x a circle c in c with center at d = 6 and radius r < 1 and let t be
the projection

(21)

t : a  a

where a is the algebra of smooth functions on c which are meromorphic
inside c with poles only at d = 6, while a is the subalgebra of a given
by polynomials in 1
z6 with no constant term. the projection t is uniquely
specied by its kernel,

(22)

ker t = a+

which is the algebra of smooth functions on c which are holomorphic inside
c.
thus t is the operation which projects on the pole part of a laurent series
according to the ms scheme. it is quite important (cf. [5] p. 103 and 6.3.1

28

p. 147) that t is only applied to dimensionless quantities which will be
ensured by our conventions in the denition (9) of u ().
being the projection on a subalgebra, a, parallel to a subalgebra, a+, the
operation t satises an equation of compatibility with the algebra structure
of a, the multiplicativity constraint ([18]),
(23)

t (x y) + t (x) t (y) = t (t (x) y + x t (y))

 x, y  a .

(by bilinearity it is enough to check it for x  a, y  a.)
we let u be the homomorphism,

(24)

u : h  a

given by the unrenormalized values of the graphs as dened in (9) and (15).
it is by construction a homomorphism from h to a, both viewed as algebras.
let us start the inductive construction of c and r. for 1pi graphs  without
subdivergences one denes c () simply by,

(25)

c () = t (u ()) .
the renormalized value of such a graph is then,

(26)

r () = u () + c () .

for 1pi graphs  with subdivergences one has,

(27)

(28)

c () = t (r ())

r () = r ()  t (r ())

where the r operation of bogoliubov, parasiuk and hepp prepares the graph
 by taking into account the counterterms c () attached to its subdiver-
gences. it is at this point that we make contact with the coproduct (ii.6) of
the hopf algebra h and claim that the following holds,
c() u (/) .
(29)

r () = u () + x 



6=

the notations are the same as in ii.6. this formula is identical to 5.3.8 b)
in [5] p. 104 provided we carefully translate our notations from one case to

29

the other. the rst point is that the recursive denition (27) holds for 1pi
graphs and  =  j is a union of such graphs so in (29) we let,
(30)

c () =  c(j) .

this agrees with (5.5.3) p. 110 in [5].
the second point is that our c () is an element of a, i.e. a laurent series,
while the counterterms used in [5] are in general functions of the momenta
which ow through the subdivergence. however since the theory is renor-
malizable we know that this dependence corresponds exactly to one of the
three terms in the original lagrangian. this means that with the notations
of ii.6 we have,

(31)

c() =x(i)

c((i)) u (/(i))

where c() is the graph with counterterms associated to the subdivergence
 as in collins 5.3.8 b).

to check (31) we have to check that our convention (9) is correct. as we
already stressed the power of the unit of mass  is chosen uniquely so that
we only deal for u , c and r with dimensionless quantities so this is in
agreement with [5] (2)p. 136. for the power of the coupling constant g it
follows from (14) that it denes a grading of the hopf algebra so that all
terms in (31) have the same overall homogeneity. there is still the question
of the symmetry factors since it would seem at rst sight that there is a
discrepancy between the convention (4) p. 24 of [5] and our convention in
(9). however a close look at the conventions of [5] (cf. p. 114) for the
symmetry factors of c() shows that (31) holds with our conventions. we
have thus checked that (29) holds and we can now write the bph recursive
denition of c and r as follows, replacing r by its value (29) for a 1pi
graph  in (27), (28),

(32)

(33)

c () = tu () + x 
r () = u () + c() + x 



6=



6=

c() u (/)

c() u (/) .

30

we now rewrite both formulas (32), (33) in terms of the hopf algebra h
without using the generators . let us rst consider (32) which together
with (30) uniquely determines the homomorphism c : h  a. we claim
that for any x  h belonging to the augmentation ideal
(34)

one has the equality,

eh = ker e

(35)

(36)

where we use the following slight variant of the sweedler notation for the
coproduct  x,

c(x) = t (u (x) +x c(x ) u (x ))
 x = x  1 + 1  x +x x   x  , x  eh

and where the components x , x  are of degree strictly less than the degree

of x. to show that (35) holds for any x  eh using (30) and (32) one
denes a map c  : h  a using (35) and one just needs to show that c  is
multiplicative. this is done in [6] [18] but we repeat the argument here for
the sake of completeness. one has, for x, y  eh

(xy ) = xy  1 + 1  xy + x  y + y  x + xy   y  +

(37)

y   xy  + x y  x  + x   x y + x y   x y  .

thus using (35) we get

(38)

c (xy ) = t (u (xy ))  t (c (x) u (y ) + c (y ) u (x) +

c (xy ) u (y ) + c (y ) u (xy ) + c (x y ) u (x )

+ c (x ) u (x y ) + c (x y ) u (x y )) .

now u is a homomorphism and we can assume that we have shown c  to be
multiplicative, c (ab) = c (a) c (b) for deg a + deg b < deg x + deg y .
this allows to rewrite (38) as,

(39)

c (xy ) = t (u (x) u (y ) + c (x) u (y ) + c (y ) u (x)

+ c (x) c (y ) u (y ) + c (y ) u (x) u (y ) + c (x ) c (y ) u (x )

+ c (x ) u (x ) u (y ) + c (x ) c (y ) u (x ) u (y ) .

let us now compute c (x) c (y ) using the multiplicativity constraint (23)
fullled by t in the form,

(40)

t (x) t (y) = t (xy) + t (t (x) y) + t (x t (y)) .

31

we thus get,

(41)

c (x) c (y ) = t ((u (x) + c (x ) u (x )) (u (y ) +
c (y ) u (y )) + t (t (u (x) + c (x ) u (x )) (u (y ) +

c (y ) u (y )) + t ((u (x) + c (x ) u (x )) t (u (y ) + c (y ) u (y )))

by applying (40) to x = u (x) + c(x ) u (x ), y = u (y ) + c(y ) u (y ).
since t (x) = c (x), t (y) = c (y ) we can rewrite (41) as,
(42)

c (x) c (y ) = t (u (x) u (y ) + c (x ) u (x ) u (y )
+ u (x) c (y ) u (y ) + c (x ) u (x ) c (y ) u (y ))

t (c (x)(u (y ) + c (y ) u (y ))  t ((u (x) + c (x ) u (x )) c (y )) .
we now compare (39) with (42), both of them contain 8 terms of the form
t (a) and one checks that they correspond pairwise which yields the mul-
tiplicativity of c  and hence the validity of (35) for c = c . we now have
a characterization of c independently of any choice of generators of h and
we can rewrite (33) in intrinsic form too,

(43)

r(x) = hc  u, (x)i

 x  h

which can be checked using (33) and the multiplicativity of both sides of
(43).
it is convenient to use the notation c  u for the homomorphism
h  a given by,
(44)

(c  u )(x) = hc  u, (x)i

 x  h .

we are now ready to check that (43) gives the birkho decomposition of the
loop  (z), z  c of elements of the group g of section 2, associated to the
homomorphism,

(45)

u : h  a .

the precise denition of  is as follows. each complex number z  c denes
a character of the algebra a given by,
z(f ) = f (z)
(46)

f  a

which makes sense since f is smooth on the curve c. thus z  u is a
character of h and hence (cf. section 2) an element of g,
(47)

(z) = z  u

 z  c .

32

next we can similarly dene two other loops with values in g, namely,

(48)

(z) = z  c , +(z) = z  r

 z  c .

the multiplicativity of both c and r, h  a ensures that we are dealing
with g-valued loops. the equality (43) just means,

(49)

+(z) = (z) (z)

 z  c

since (44) is the same as the operation of pointwise product in g for g-valued
loops. it remains to check that  extends to a g-valued map holomorphic

in c+. by (35) one has c(eh)  a and every z  c denes using (46) a
character on a with  = 0 the trivial character. it thus follows that 
extends to a g-valued map holomorphic on c and such that,

(50)

() = 1 .

similarly, by (35) one has t ((c  u )(x)) = 0 so that r(eh)  a+ = ker t .
since every z  c+ denes using (46) a character of a+ we see that +
extends to a g-valued map holomorphic in c+. this shows that (49) gives
the birkho decomposition of  and that the renormalized value r() of any
1pi graph is simply obtained by replacing the ill dened evaluation (d) by
+(d).

again, a few remarks are in order. first, the above decomposition singles
out the use of minimal subtraction together with dim.reg. as a favoured
approach. from here, one can nd the relation to other schemes using the
methods of [18]. in [8] we will discuss the global nature of the group gc, its
relation with dieomorphism groups and with the renormalization group.
we shall also discuss the relation between the quantized calculus and the
reduction to rst order poles implicitly allowed by the above combinatorial
structure.

finally, the reader might expect that the relation to the riemann-hilbert
problem indicates the presence of a dierential equation in z which relates
the z dependence of counterterms and renormalized greens functions to
derivations on the hopf algebra. such a dierential equation can be given
and the relation of monodromy to anomalous dimensions will be discussed
in [8] as well.
