abstract

we discuss z2  z2 orientifolds where the orbifold twists are accompanied by shifts
on momentum or winding lattice states. the models contain variable numbers of d5

branes, whose massless (and, at times, even massive) modes have variable numbers of

supersymmetries. we display new type-i models with partial supersymmetry break-

ing n = 2  n = 1, n = 4  n = 1 and n = 4  n = 2. the geometry of these
models is rather rich: the shift operations create brane multiplets related by orbifold

transformations that support gauge groups of reduced rank. some of the models

are deformations of six-dimensional supersymmetric type-i models, while others have

dual m-theory descriptions.

introduction

2

freely acting orbifolds are a useful tool for connecting string vacua with dierent num-

bers of supersymmetries. the resulting models provide string realizations of the scherk-

schwarz mechanism [1, 2, 3], where additional supersymmetries may be recovered in an

appropriate decompactication limit. if the original model has extended supersymmetry,

the corresponding bps states, still present in the vacuum with lower supersymmetry, have

mass shifts determined by the spontaneous breaking. as a result, duality relations generally

continue to hold by the adiabatic argument, and the dynamics of the new vacua simplies

greatly [4].

type i models may be directly linked [5] to models of oriented closed strings, and in

particular to those considered in [3]. they allow an interesting new possibility compared to

the heterotic and type ii models studied previously [6, 7]: branes orthogonal to the coor-

dinate used for the breaking have full supersymmetry for their massless excitations at tree

level, and feel the breaking only through radiative corrections. this phenomenon, gener-

ically non-perturbative on the heterotic side, is of some interest in the current literature

on brane kaluza-klein scenarios, where it is usually referred to as brane supersymmetry

[8]. from a more technical perspective, the closed sector of these models involves asym-

metric projections, so that the construction of the open descendants presents some peculiar

features. asymmetric models have recently been studied in a dierent context, since they

provide an interesting route toward a small or vanishing cosmological constant [9]. the

corresponding open descendants, studied in [10], display an even more peculiar feature: all

massive brane modes, not only the massless ones, can have an extended supersymmetry

[8].

in this work we provide new examples of this class of models in the context of z2  z2
orbifolds where the conventional projections are accompanied by z2-valued momentum or

winding lattice shifts. their open descendants exhibit n = 4  n = 1 or n = 2  n = 1

3

partial supersymmetry breaking, and involve interesting d-brane congurations, with a

rich geometrical structure, that we describe in some detail. these models display enhanced

supersymmetry for the massless modes on the branes, and in some cases also for their

massive excitations, as the asymmetric orbifolds discussed in [10]. the presence of extended

supersymmetry in some of the branes, however, has a drawback in the present construction,

since the models we exhibit here are not chiral.

an important new feature is that the branes typically arrange themselves in multiplets

of images that are interchanged by some of the orbifold operations. the components of

a multiplet share the corresponding chan-paton charges and, as a result, the rank of the

corresponding gauge groups is reduced, as in models with a quantized ns antisymmetric

tensor [11]. here the displacement of branes that results in the creation of the multiplets

is generally unavoidable, so that even the most symmetric conguration typically involves

several images. moreover, the image branes play a crucial role in the local tadpole can-

cellation along the (shifted) directions transverse to the branes. more precisely, as we will

discuss in detail in explicit models, a doublet of image branes ensures the local cancellation

of tadpoles introduced in one transverse direction by its two orientifold plane charges, while

a quadruplet of image branes ensures local tadpole cancellation in two transverse (shifted)

directions. these conditions are eective if the various types of branes do not intersect,

a property shared by all our congurations. as a result, in most of our models the local

tadpole conditions are automatically satised, thanks to the images that appear since the

branes are generally forced away from their xed points. other brane congurations with

less supersymmetry are also possible, but they do not satisfy local tadpole cancellation.

compared with toroidal examples, where local tadpoles require that the gauge group, of

rank 16, be broken by wilson lines [14] , in our examples a set of m image branes share

the same gauge group that, however, has a rank reduced to 16/m.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we describe the structure of the su-

4

persymmetric z2  z2 model without discrete torsion1. in section 3 we dene the shift
orientifolds and describe qualitatively their main properties, the structure of the corre-

sponding d-brane congurations and identify various instances of brane supersymmetry.

in section 4 we present the conformal eld theory description and the open string parti-

tion functions for branes away from xed points in simple examples, while in section 5 we

describe a model with n = 2  n = 1 breaking that displays rather clearly all the salient
features of our constructions. section 6, 7 and 8 contain a description of models with two,

one and zero sets of d5 branes, including their limiting behaviors for large or small radii

where extended supersymmetry is recovered, and their relation to m-theory compactica-

tions. finally, section 9 contains the summary of our results and our conclusions.

2. supersymmetric z2  z2 models

there are two classes of supersymmetric z2  z2 models, that dier from one another
because of the presence of discrete torsion [13]. in the partition function, this is a sign

associated to an independent modular orbit, with crucial eects both on the massless eld

content and on the structure of the descendants. these orbifolds are singular limits of

calabi-yau spaces, with hodge numbers (3, 51) and (51, 3) respectively.

the torus amplitudes for the supersymmetric z2  z2 models are

where [12].

where 1, 2 and 3 denote the three lattice sums associated to the three internal tori t45,

t67 and t89 of the compactication and  = 1. here, as in all following amplitudes, we
are leaving the contributions of transverse bosons implicit. the choice  = 1 denes the

model without discrete torsion, while the choice  = 1 denes the model with discrete
torsion. the model with discrete torsion is quite interesting, since its descendants contain

chiral fermions, but presents some diculties, since some of the untwisted tadpoles can

not be eliminated in the usual way, and will be discussed elsewhere.

as usual, the arguments depend on q = exp(2i ) and its conjugate, where  is the

modulus of the torus. for later convenience, we have expressed the torus amplitude in

terms of the 16 quantities tij (i = o, g, h, f ):

tio = io + ig + ih + if

tih = io  ig + ih  if

,

tig = io + ig  ih  if

with o2, v2, s2, c2 the four o(2) level-one characters. the ordering of the four factors

refers to the eight transverse dimensions of space time and, in particular, the rst factor is

associated to the two transverse space-time directions. the notation (o, g, h, f ) reects the

four operations in z2  z2. aside from the identity o, these act as -rotations on two of
the three internal tori, namely

g : (+,,)

,

f : (, +,)

,

h : (,, +)

.

(2.4)

one can now follow the usual procedure and build the three additional amplitudes

that, together with (2.1), determine the spectrum of the open descendants: klein-bottle

k, annulus a and mobius strip m. there are actually a number of distinct choices for
k, that correspond to dierent choices for three signs (1,2,3) that dene the world-
sheet projection for twisted states. in all cases these signs are related to the parameter 

introduced previously, since they must satisfy

1 2 3 = 

.

(2.5)

thus, the models with discrete torsion require an odd number of negative signs, while

the models without discrete torsion require an even number of negative signs. let us now

introduce the restrictions of the full lattice sums i to their momentum and winding sub-

lattices. these will be denoted by pi and wi, where the index identies the corresponding

7

two-torus. in later sections, as in [6, 7], we shall also need sums with alternating signs in
one direction of the two-torii, that we shall denote succinctly as (1)mp or (1)nw . in
terms of these quantities the klein-bottle amplitude in the direct channel is

k =

4(cid:19)2(cid:27) .(2.6)

the discrete torsion has a crucial eect on this term. indeed, while for  = 1 the massless

twisted contributions are diagonal combinations of the  s, and describe n = 2 vector mul-

tiplets, for  = 1 they are o-diagonal ones that describe (chiral-linear) hypermultipets,
and therefore do not contribute to the klein bottle amplitude. this feature reects itself

in the nature of the terms (pi + wi) in k. while for  = 1 these have no massless
contributions, for  = +1 they do, and one has additional options, related to the i. for

instance, starting from the original twisted n = 2 vector multiplets, in the klein-bottle

projection 1 = 1 selects n = 1 chiral multiplets, while 1 = 1 selects vector multiplets.
an s transformation turns this expression into the corresponding vacuum-channel am-

where the superscript e stands for the usual restriction of the lattice terms to their even

this is neatly displayed by conning the attention to the terms at the origin of the lattices,

that are to group into perfect squares. indeed, the corresponding amplitude,

displays four independent squared reection coecients, related to the 9-brane and to

the three types of 5-branes, only if eq. (2.5) is satised.

it should be appreciated that

the constraint (2.5) implies that, in the presence of discrete torsion, at least one of the

orientifold charges is reversed. this is the problem we mentioned at the beginning. here

we conne our attention to the choice 1 = 2 = 3 = 1 for the model without discrete

torsion.

it is instructive to review the structure of the open descendants for the model without

discrete torsion. the orbifold breakings are not allowed in this case: the twisted terms

involve diagonal combinations of the (non-self-conjugate) characters ij, that cannot ow

in the tube channel. the allowed terms describe the familiar nn, nd and dd strings or,

in brane language, the 99, 5i9 and 5i5i terms, together with additional, more peculiar, 5i5j

strings. for the sake of simplicity, let us also refrain from introducing wilson lines, insert

all 5-branes at the origin and exclude a quantized ns bab, in order to obtain a relatively

simple model with a maximal gauge group.

the annulus amplitude for the model without discrete torsion is

4(cid:19)2(cid:27) .

(2.9)

aside from the standard nn terms associated with the 9-branes, there are indeed three

types of standard d2

i terms, and corresponding ndi terms. each of these didi strings,

however, is only conned within one of the three two-tori, but is free to move at will on it.

in addition, there are three other types of strings of a more peculiar nature, where dirichlet

9

and neumann conditions are entangled. the need for all these types of strings can easily

be appreciated by noticing that, relatively to the three internal two-tori, the three twists

of the z2  z2 orbifold result in open string ends with boundary conditions of four types:
nnn, ndd, dnd and ddn. combining these boundaries in all possible ways yields

all types of open strings present in the model. aside from the familiar nn, ndi and didi

strings, the spectrum thus includes three additional types of open strings, that are dd

with respect to a torus and nd with respect to the others. for instance, the combination

of ndd and dnd is a string of this type, dd in the third torus and nd in the rst two.

notice that the mobius amplitude reveals the presence of four symplectic gauge groups. the

lack of breaking terms, however, requires a rescaling of the four charges by a factor two, in

order to grant a proper particle interpretation, and the resulting gauge group is usp(16)4.

this model was discussed in [15] and, at a rational point, was previously considered in [16].

the massless spectrum can be easily read from a and m. it is clearly not chiral, and
is thus free of gauge and gravitational anomalies. rescaling the charges, so that n = 2n

and di = 2di, one obtains

a0 =

n2 + d2

1 + d2

2 + d2

(2.19)

these amplitudes describe the adjoint vector multiplets of the four usp(16) groups, three

chiral multiplets, each in the (120, 1, 1, 1), (1, 120, 1, 1), (1, 1, 120, 1) and (1, 1, 1, 120), and

six chiral multiplets in the (16, 16, 1, 1) and in ve additional bi-fundamental representations

that dier by permutations of the factors.

3. general properties of z2  z2 shift orientifolds

if conventional orbifold operations are combined with shifts (l, r), the resulting mod-

els provide string realizations [3] of the scherk-schwarz mechanism [1]. in this section we

would like to describe the salient features of the combined eects of shifts (l, r) and

z2  z2 orbifold operations on the open descendants of type-iib compactications. as in

12

[6, 7], we shall distinguish between symmetric momentum shifts (p) = (, ) and antisym-

metric winding shifts (w) = (,), since the two have very dierent eects on the resulting
spectra. these orbifolds correspond to singular limits of calabi-yau manifolds with hodge

numbers (19, 19), (11, 11) and (3, 3) in the cases of one, two and three shifts respectively.

let us begin by introducing a convenient notation to specify the orbifold action xi 
(xi) on the complex coordinates for the three internal tori. there are several ways to

combine the three operations g, f and h of eq. (2.4) with shifts in a way consistent with

the z2  z2 group structure. however, up to t-dualities and corresponding redenitions
of the  projection, all non-trivial possibilities are captured by

1(1, 2, 3) =

,

2(1, 2, 3) =

, (3.1)

where the three lines refer to the new operations, that we shall continue to denote by

g, h and f , and where i indicates the combination of a shift in the direction i with
it is simple to convince oneself that the two matrices 1 and 2
an orbifold inversion.

essentially exhaust all interesting possibilities within this class of models. in order to reach

this conclusion, it is important to recognize that when a shift only occurs in combination

with an orbifold inversion, it corresponds to a mere rotation of the xed points, up to

t-dualities and redenitions of the  projection. models of this type are not freely-acting

orbifolds, but rather conventional z2 z2 orbifolds with unconventional  projections, and
therefore are not discussed in this paper, although in some cases they lead to interesting

chiral spectra. for instance, a similar winding shift eliminates some branes and yields chiral

open descendants. another possibility, not considered here, is to combine the  projection

with only one of the two group elements of z2  z2.

t-duality transformations can be neatly discussed referring to the tables (3.1), if these

are supplemented by an additional line corresponding to the identity operation. a t-

duality along a torus simply ips the signs in the corresponding column and interchanges

13

momentum and winding shifts. for instance, starting from 1 and performing a t-duality

along t67 and t89 would result in the table

redenition of , that now includes a factor (1)1+
2.

2,

in the following, we shall display a set of independent models, corresponding to various

choices of momentum and winding shifts, while restricting our attention to a conventional

 projection. other choices for , including shifts, may be similarly discussed. as in

[18, 19], they generally aect the brane content, removing (or even adding) branes. with

this proviso, we can conne our attention to ten dierent types of z2  z2 shift orbifolds.
a simple and general rule predicts the types of allowed branes, and will be justied in

the following sections:

when a line of the table contains p or w, the corresponding brane is eliminated.

on the other hand, our choice of referring to a conventional  projection will always

result in leaving the d9 branes unaected. up to t-dualities and redenitions of , one

can then shown that all interesting brane congurations may be captured referring to the

ten dierent models of table 1.

table 1. types of shift models.

in listing these models, we have made suitable choices of axes, so that when a single d5

brane is present, this is always the rst, d51, and when two are present, these are always

d51 and d52. all these models have n = 1 supersymmetry in the closed sector, but

present interesting instances of brane supersymmetry [6, 8]: additional supersymmetries

are present for the massless modes, and at times also for the massive ones [10], conned to

some branes. it is therefore interesting to display, for all the models of table 1, the number

of supersymmetries of the massless modes for the various branes present. the results are

summarized in table 2:

table 2. brane supersymmetry for the various models.

since the p123 case was already discussed in [7], in the following we can conne our attention

to the nine remaining classes of models.

in all models with one or two shifts, the supersymmetry enhancement for the mass-

less modes on the branes may be traced directly to the phenomenon described in [6, 7]:

projections accompanied by momentum shifts orthogonal to a brane do not reduce the

supersymmetry of the massless modes. as an example, let us consider the w1p2 model

that contains d9 and d51 branes. after performing a t-duality along the rst and the

third tori, the d9 branes turn into d52 branes and the d51 branes turn into d53 branes,

while the resulting model has momentum shifts in the rst two directions. these are both

orthogonal to the d53 branes, and the corresponding massless modes have indeed n = 4

supersymmetry. on the other hand, one of these shifts is parallel to the d52 branes and

breaks the corresponding supersymmetry to n = 2. models with three shifts are more

subtle, due to the z2  z2 group structure of the transformations, but may be understood

along similar lines.

16

with this proviso, we can conclude this section by giving another simple rule, that will

be justied in the next section, to predict the amount of supersymmetry for the massless

modes of a brane:

supersymmetry is enhanced for the massless modes on a brane when the scherk-

schwarz breaking is induced by momentum shifts orthogonal to it, or in all cases

that may be linked to this by suitable t -dualities.

4. structure of the shift orientifolds

in this section we would like to describe how to construct the vacuum amplitudes for

the open descendants of z2  z2 shift-orbifold models.

in all cases the starting point is a deformation of the torus amplitude (2.1), where mo-

mentum or winding shifts induce corresponding modications of the twisted contributions.

for instance, for the case of two momentum shifts the torus amplitude is

t =

in all these deformed models, the independent orbit related to the discrete torsion is absent.

the corresponding open descendants are essentially determined by the direct-channel
klein-bottle amplitude k and by the transverse-channel annulus amplitude a. moreover,
the former, to which we now turn, is fully specied by the corresponding table (1 or 2)

and by our choice of working with a conventional  projection.

the klein-bottle amplitudes are generically aected by the shifts, that can make the

17

transverse-channel contributions massive. as in the supersymmetric case discussed in sec-

tion 2, the direct-channel amplitude, k, includes four distinct contributions, corresponding
to p1p2p3, p1w2w3, w1p2w3 and w1w2p3 where, as in previous sections, pi and wi in-

dicate lattice sums restricted to zero windings or zero momenta, respectively. these four

terms reect the z2  z2 structure of these models, and determine their content of d9,
d51, d52 and d53 branes. whenever these terms are accompanied in k by phases induced
by the shifts, the corresponding vacuum-channel contributions are lifted in mass, and tad-

pole conditions eliminate the corresponding branes. in order to describe this eect in some

detail, let us identify the two types of projected lattice operators corresponding to the shift

matrices 1 and 2 of eq. (3.1) :

v1 = ei(p1lx1l+p2lx2l+p3lx3l+(lr)) + (1)1+2 ei(p1lx1lp2lx2lp3lx3l+(lr))
+(1)2+3 ei(p1lx1l+p2lx2lp3lx3l+(lr)) + (1)1+3 ei(p1lx1lp2lx2l+p3lx3l+(lr)) ,
v2 = ei(p1lx1l+p2lx2l+p3lx3l+(lr)) + (1)1 ei(p1lx1lp2lx2lp3lx3l+(lr))
+(1)2+3 ei(p1lx1l+p2lx2lp3lx3l+(lr)) + (1)1+2+3 ei(p1lx1lp2lx2l+p3lx3l+(lr)) ,

(4.3)

(4.2)

where (1) is (1)m for a momentum shift and (1)n for a winding shift. these operators
combine with diagonal untwisted oscillator contributions, such as |oo|2, and can thus ow
both in the klein bottle k and in the transverse-channel annulus amplitude a. as we have
seen, the four types of contributions to k, that correspond to p1p2p3, p1w2w3, w1p2w3
and w1w2p3, involve restricted lattice sums. they arise from operators like those in eqs.

(4.2) and (4.3), specialized to the cases of vanishing momenta or windings, that are therefore

eigenvectors of . moreover, for the p1p2p3 case the eigenvalue is always one, while in the
other cases it is simple to see from eq. (4.2) that the eigenvalues are (1)1+2, (1)2+3
and (1)2+3 for the 1 case, and (1)1, (1)2+3 and (1)1+2+3 for the 2 case. the
end result is that, aside from twisted contributions, the klein bottle projections for the two

cases may be written in the form

18

k1 =

and

k2 =

1

8 np1p2p3 + (1)1+2p1w2w3 + (1)2+3w1p2w3 + (1)1+3w1w2p3o too

8 np1p2p3 + (1)1p1w2w3 + (1)2+3w1p2w3 + (1)1+2+3w1w2p3o too

,

(4.4)

.

(4.5)

in order to describe the brane content of a given model, one can then specialize these

equations to the corresponding choice of (momentum or winding) shifts. whenever a phase

has a nontrivial eect on a restricted lattice sum, the corresponding transverse-channel

contribution is lifted in mass, and the tadpole conditions eliminate the corresponding brane.

for instance, for the p1w2w3 sum this is the case for a momentum shift along the rst

torus, and/or for winding shifts along the other two tori. in order to discuss a concrete

example, let us consider the p23 model. in this case the only phases present are 2 = m2

and 3 = m3, while the corresponding multiplication table is 2. then, aside from twisted

contributions

k =

1
8 {p1p2p3 + p1w2w3 + (1)m2w1p2w3 + (1)m3w1w2p3} too

,

(4.6)

and consequently one is left only with d9 and d51 branes.

the twisted contributions to the klein-bottle amplitude can then be induced most
conveniently, in all models, from the terms in k at the origin of the lattices, that they are
to complete into perfect squares. we shall see several examples of this procedure in the

following sections.

the other crucial ingredient of the construction, to which we now turn, is the transverse-
channel annulus amplitude a. this presents some subtleties, since the shift orbifold re-
stricts the allowed untwisted modes. these constraints have a simple geometrical origin: in

general, the xed tori of one operation are paired by the others and form multiplets, whose

19

members must accommodate identical brane sets. as a result, branes are accompanied by
a number of images, and the restrictions on the form of a determine their minimal cong-
urations. this is reminiscent of what happens in ordinary orbifolds when, by a continuous

deformation, a brane is moved o a xed point, but in shift orbifolds the presence of image

branes is in general unavoidable.

in order to prepare the grounds for the discussion of the shift orbifolds, it is instructive

to see how the displacement of branes works in the t 4/z2 orbifold. this phenomenon, rst

discussed in [21], may be given a complete description in conformal eld theory starting

from the torus amplitude

the simplest conguration, where all d5 branes are at the same xed point and no

wilson lines are introduced, results in the gauge group u(16)9  u(16)5. the familiar
spectrum [20, 21] comprises two pairs of hypermultiplets in the (120, 1) and (1, 120) from

the 99 and 55 sectors, and an additional 59 hypermultiplet in the (16, 16).

here n denotes the total number of d9 branes, d denotes the total number of d5 branes

left at the origin,  counts the number of displaced branes, and rn and rd account

for the eect of the orbifold breaking on the chan-paton charges at the xed points. if

 6= 1/2, the moved branes are also away from the other xed point on the circle, and
the corresponding breaking terms r are absent. since the consistency of the conformal

21

theory in both channels allows only breaking terms for branes sitting at xed points, one

is forced to let  = 2d, thus eectively splitting the charge between image branes. this is

somewhat reminiscent of the splitting induced by a quantized ns bab [11], and indeed the

rank of the gauge group is correspondingly reduced. these features reect the geometry of

the brane conguration, that includes pairs of images interchanged by orbifold operations.

the structure of m implies that in this case the gauge groups carried by the displaced
branes are symplectic and have a reduced rank [21]. we would like to stress that, while in

the absence of breaking terms the  contributions appear to have enhanced supersymmetry,

this is actually reduced by the mobius projection, as was the case for the supersymmetric

z2  z2 model without discrete torsion discussed in section 2. on the other hand, in
the following sections we shall see that in shift orbifolds m respects the enhancement of
supersymmetry. summarizing, for  6= 1/2 the d5 gauge group generically breaks from
u(16) to u(16  2d)  usp(2d). on the other hand, for  = 1/2 the pairs of images meet
at the other xed point on the circle. the orbifold breakings are now allowed for all d5

branes, and the rank of the d5 gauge group is correspondingly enhanced. in the transverse

channel, the modied breaking terms

reect the position of the d5 branes, that now occupy both xed points along the circle,

and indeed at the origin eq. (4.12) becomes

n(cid:21)

.

(4.13)

these results have a direct bearing on the main subject of this paper. indeed, if some

orbifold operation were to interchange the two xed points where we have placed the d5

branes, as will be the case in the z2z2 shift orientifolds discussed in the following sections,
one would be forced to set d =  and rd = r, and as a result for  = 1/2 a would
include the projector

.

(4.14)

summarizing, the presence of brane multiplets in the vacuum conguration reects itself
in the presence of corresponding projection operators in a.

we can now turn to describe how the projection operators may be determined for the

two classes of models corresponding to 1 and 2. the starting point are the projected

lattice operators v1 and v2 of eqs. (4.2) and (4.3), that combine in the closed spectrum

with diagonal untwisted oscillator contributions, such as oo. they are clearly allowed in
a, and determine the nn and didi terms, and thus the brane content of the models. if
we let the corresponding states ow in the tube, all terms in v1 and v2, being degenerate

in mass, are accompanied by the same power of q, and thus one inherits the projectors

1  1 + (1)1+2 + (1)2+3 + (1)1+3
2  1 + (1)1 + (1)2+3 + (1)1+2+3

,

.

(4.15)

(4.16)

in order to give a concrete example, let us refer again to the p23 model, that as we have

seen has d9 and d51 branes. in this case

 =

1

2 (cid:16)1 + (1)m2+m3(cid:17)

,

(4.17)

and all states owing in the transverse channel of the annulus must have correlated mo-

menta, both even or both odd in the corresponding two circles of the last two tori. clearly,

 has no eect on the d9 contribution, that in the transverse-channel annulus amplitude

only involves windings. however, it does play a crucial role for the sector associated to the

d51 brane. in this case, the transverse-channel contribution corresponds to w1p2p3, and

the projection aects the momenta in the last two sums. since the poisson transform of the

restricted sum is proportional to p1(w2w3 + w n+1/2

2

w n+1/2

3

), where the w n+1/2

i

in the last

two factors denote shifted sums, in the direct channel  gives rise to a doublet of branes.

as we have seen, this is precisely the type of conguration required by the structure of the

shift orbifold.

23

5. an interesting example with n = 2  n = 1 breaking

in this section we would like to describe in some detail an interesting class of models,

obtained introducing in the table 2 of eq. (3.1) momentum shifts p2 and p3 in two lattice

directions, where n = 2 supersymmetry is spontaneously broken to n = 1. the previous

analysis reveals that, in addition to d9-branes, they also contain d51 branes. they have

the rather interesting feature of displaying various numbers of supersymmetries in the bulk

and on the branes in a relatively simple setting. the thumb rule of section 3 predicts in

this case n = 1 supersymmetry for the d9 branes, since the two shifts are parallel to their

world volume, and n = 2 supersymmetry for the massless modes of the d51 branes, since

they are acted upon by the g projection, while the two shifts are orthogonal to their world

volume.

whereas the 99 strings are rather conventional, and have the usual three projection terms,

although aected by the momentum shifts as in the simpler models of [6, 7], the congu-

ration of the 55 strings is more peculiar, and admits a nice geometrical interpretation: it

corresponds to a doublet of branes, associated to a pair of tori xed by g and interchanged

by f and h. only the g projection is present, since in this sector the physical states are

combinations of pairs localized on the image branes. in this case the full d51 spectrum,

not only its massless modes, has enhanced supersymmetry. we have already stressed that

multiplets of branes are a generic feature of these shift orbifolds. even if one attempts to

insert all branes at a xed point, the other operations typically move them, and give rise

to multiple images. this is summarized for this class of models in gure 2, where the three

axes refer to the three two-tori t45, t67 and t89. as usual, the massive untwisted excitations

of these orbifold models have enhanced supersymmetry, although they have only a fraction

25

of the lattice modes present in the toroidal case. more precisely, the g projection forbids

this extension in the rst torus, while in the second and third tori the projected combi-

nations of lattice states have indeed n = 2 supersymmetry in the 99 sector and n = 4

supersymmetry in the 55 sector.

figure 2. d51 brane conguration for the p23 model

the previous considerations determine the structure of the breaking terms in the trans-

verse channel: as we have anticipated, the d51 branes occupy a pair of xed tori, while

all others are empty. then, according to the rule discussed in the previous section, in the

transverse channel the breaking terms are to group into the structures

while the gauge groups allowed by the tadpole conditions in this class of models are

(5.15)

the tree-level spectrum of the d9 branes has n = 1 supersymmetry, while the whole

spectrum of the d51 branes, orthogonal to the directions used to induce supersymmetry

breaking, has indeed n = 2 supersymmetry. this is one more instance of the phenomenon

discussed in [6, 7], and extended to the whole spectrum in [10], as suggested in [8]. the

massless spectrum is not chiral, and includes 99 chiral multiplets in the representations

(o(o  1)/2, 1, 1), (1, g(g  1)/2, 1), (o, g, 1), (o, g, 1) and their hermitian conjugates, one
pair of 55 hypermultiplets in the representation (1, 1, d(d  1)/2), and 59 hypermultiplets
in the representations (o, 1, d) and (1, g, d).

it is instructive to discuss the behavior of this spectrum in the decompactication limit

for the directions used to break supersymmetry. in [7] we studied some simpler examples,

where momentum (or winding) shifts along one coordinate were combined with a single z2

orbifold inversion in other directions. in these cases it is relatively simple to understand

how, in the singular r   (r  0) limit, the deformed spectrum collapses into a
continuum of momentum (winding) modes with n=4 supersymmetry. on the other hand,

in the decompactication limit, the p2p3 models discussed in this section recover only n=2

supersymmetry. this is already a subtler setting, even in the supersymmetric case without

shifts:

in this limit the untwisted bulk states are still in the presence of walls, so that

their momentum modes are still projected, while some twisted states are moved to innity,

together with the corresponding xed points. in these shifted non-compact orbifolds, the

momentum modes for the untwisted states merge in the limit in an extended continuum,

but some of the xed points, with the corresponding brane content, move away to innity.

moreover, in these open-string models the singular limit is usually accompanied by the

emergence of new tadpoles [14, 6], that may be eliminated arranging for local cancellations

[26]. actually, in this case if only one of the radii r2 and r3 tends to innity, the local

28

tadpole conditions are identically satised. this fact has a simple geometric reason: the

image doublets of d51 branes saturate locally the rr charge. we would like to stress that

the identied images carry the same gauge group, a fact to be contrasted with the simpler

toroidal setting of [14]. on the other hand, when both radii are large, the saturation requires

a further breaking of the d51 gauge group to u(4)u(4). in the decompactication limit of
these p2p3 models, a single set of d5 branes is left, with a u(4) gauge group, while the others

are moved to innity. this limiting conguration may still be linked to the conventional
u(16)9  u(16)5 setting of the compact t 4/z2 orbifold, albeit in a (u(4)5)4 conguration,
and where 12 of the d51 branes have been moved to innity in the decompactication

limit.

6. freely-acting orbifold models with two d5 branes

in this section we describe other classes of shift models of this type, with two d5 branes.

our aim is to give a geometrical interpretation of the corresponding brane multiplets and

to exhibit their m theory limits, whenever they exist, as well as their massless spectra. for

the sake of brevity, we shall only display direct-channel amplitudes.

6.1. one momentum shift

this case corresponds to introducing a single momentum shift p3 in the table 1 of eq.

(3.1). the resulting models contain d9, d51 and d52 branes. the direct-channel klein

then require a gauge group

[u(o)  u(g)]9  [u(8)]51  [u(8)]52 .

(6.6)

the massless spectrum is again not chiral and has n = 1 supersymmetry on the d9

branes and n = 2 supersymmetry on the two types of d5 branes, that are orthogonal

to the direction used for the breaking. the 99 spectrum contains chiral multiplets in the

representations (o(o  1)/2, 1, 1, 1), (1, g(g  1)/2, 1, 1), (o, g, 1, 1) and (o, g, 1, 1) and their
conjugates. on the other hand, the 55 spectrum contains pairs of n = 2 hypermultiplets

in the representations (1, 1, d1(d1  1)/2, 1) and (1, 1, 1, d2(d2  1)/2). finally, the 59 spec-
trum includes hypermultiplets in the representations (o, 1, d1, 1), (1, g, d1, 1), (o, 1, 1, d2) and

(1, g, 1, d2).

the brane content of the p2p3 models discussed in the previous section is eectively a

truncation of this, since the additional momentum shift eliminates the d52 branes. here

one can follow more closely the decompactication limit of the single direction that ac-

commodates the shift and, interestingly, the resulting low-lying modes originate from a

superposition of states in two orbifold directions. thus, the two orthogonal sets of d5
branes are eectively parallel in this limit, where a more conventional u(16)9  (u(8)5)2
structure is recovered. the annulus amplitude is compatible from the start with local tad-

pole cancellations, because of the doublet structure of the d51 and d52 branes. moreover,

two sets of d5 branes are present in the limit, where the corresponding u(8)  u(8) gauge
group nds the usual explanation in terms of horava-witten walls [22], as in the simpler

examples of [6, 7].

6.2. one winding shift and one momentum shift

31

this case corresponds to introducing a winding shift w2 and a momentum shift p3 in

the table 2 of eq. (3.1). the resulting models contain d9, d51 and d52 branes. the

and the d52 branes into d5

the p2p3 model discussed in section 5, via a t-duality in the rst two tori. still, we have

chosen to display it, since it shows how a simple redenition of  can aect both the brane

distribution and the superymmetry of the massless modes.

we can parameterize the charges according to

n = 2(n + n) ,

d1 = 2(d1 + d1) ,

d2 = 4d2 ,

g = i(n  n) ,

g1 = i(d1  d1) ,

(6.10)

and the tadpole conditions

n = 8 ,

d1 = 8 ,

d2 = 8

(6.11)

then require a gauge group

u(8)9  u(8)51  so(8)52

.

(6.12)

the massless spectrum is again not chiral and has n = 2 supersymmetry on the d9 and

d51 branes, and n = 4 supersymmetry on the d52 branes. our thumb rule explains rather

naturally the rst two results: the d9 branes are not aected by the (parallel) winding

shift, while the d51 branes are not aected by the (orthogonal) momentum shift.

aside from the gauge multiplets, the massless spectrum contains pairs of n = 2 hyper-

multiplets in the representation (28, 1, 1) from the 99 sector, in the representation (1, 28, 1)

from the 5151 sector, and in the representation (8, 8, 1) from the 951 sector.

in this case the interesting limits are r2  0 and r3  . now all local tadpoles
are canceled, even in the simultaneous limit, without the need of any further splitting.

this interesting property nds again a natural explanation in the geometry of the brane

33

multiplets. indeed, while the d9 and d51 branes, orthogonal to one of the directions where

shifts have been introduced, are properly arranged in doublets, the d52 branes, orthogonal

to both, are arranged in quadruplets. this structure is, again, exactly as needed to ensure

local tadpole cancellation. moreover, as quadruplets are moved by all projections, their

massless modes have n = 4 supersymmetry.

the massless spectrum is again not chiral and has n = 2 supersymmetry on the d9

branes and n = 4 supersymmetry on the d51 branes. actually, the whole massive spectrum

of d51 branes has n = 2 supersymmetry. our thumb rule explains rather naturally these

properties: the d9 branes are not aected by the (parallel) winding shift, while the d51

branes, orthogonal to both directions of breaking (after t45 duality) arrange themselves in

a quartet geometry, with n = 4 supersymmetry. the multiplet structure of the branes is,

once more, directly compatible with all local tadpole cancellations. aside from the gauge

multiplets, the spectrum contains pairs of n = 2 hypermultiplets in the representation

figure 7. d9 and d51 branes for the w1p2p3 model, after t45 duality.

the gure shows, after a t45 duality, the conguration of the d9 branes (now d7 branes,

represented as two planes), and of the d51 branes (now d3 branes) in the model.

also in this case, we can parameterize the charges according to

n = 2(n + n) ,

f = i(n  n) ,

d1 = 4d ,

(7.10)

and the tadpole conditions

then require a gauge group

38

n = d1 = 32 ,

u(8)9  so(8)51 .

(7.11)

(7.12)

again, with a discrete wilson line on the mobius strip, one can also obtain a class of models

with d9 gauge groups so(n)  so(16  n).

the massless spectrum is again not chiral and has n = 2 supersymmetry on the d9

branes and n = 4 supersymmetry on the d51 branes. moreover, the whole massive spec-

trum of d51 branes has n = 2 supersymmetry. aside from the gauge multiplets, the

spectrum contains pairs of n = 2 hypermultiplets in the representation (28, 1) from the

99 sector. in this model the d9 brane is orthogonal to the r1 direction, while the d51

brane is orthogonal to all three directions used for the breaking. therefore, the complete

local tadpole cancellation in the simultaneous limit r1  0, r2, r3   requires a further
splitting for the d51 brane, with a resulting gauge group u(8)9  [so(4)  so(4)]51.

7.3. one momentum shift and two winding shifts

this case corresponds to introducing a momentum shift p2 along the second torus, and

two winding shifts w1 and w3 along the other two tori in the table 1 of eq. (3.1). the

letting n = 4n and d1 = 4d, the tadpole conditions result in the gauge group

.

(7.16)

in this model the interesting limits are r1, r3  0 and r2  . the d9 branes are
orthogonal to the r1, r3 directions, while the d51 branes are orthogonal to the r1, r2

directions. thus, complete local tadpole cancellations ask for quadruplets of d9 and d5

branes, that is indeed the conguration shown in figure 8. the resulting massless spectrum

has n = 4 supersymmetry, both on the d9 and on the d51 branes, while the massive

spectrum has n = 2 supersymmetry on both.

8. freely-acting orbifold models without d5 branes

in this section we provide a description of the remaining classes of shift models, that do

not contain d5 branes. as in the previous sections, for the sake of brevity we only display

direct-channel amplitudes.

also in this case, we can parameterize the charges according to

g = i(n  n)

,

and the tadpole conditions

then require a gauge group

again, with a discrete wilson line on the mobius strip, one can also obtain a class of models

with d9 gauge groups so(n)so(16n). the spectrum is again not chiral and has n = 2
supersymmetry at all mass levels. aside from the gauge multiplets, the spectrum contains

pairs of n = 2 hypermultiplets in the representation (28, 1) from the 99 sector.

the interesting limits to consider in this case are r1   and r2, r3  0, and the
in the simultaneous r2, r3  0 limit, local
tadpole conditions ask for a quadruplet structure, while the d9 branes have actually a

d9 branes are orthogonal to r2 and r3.

41

doublet structure. therefore, the simultaneous local tadpoles ask for a further breaking

u(8)  u(4)  u(4), while of course the separate limits r2  0 (or r3  0) are not
singular.

8.2. three winding shifts

this case corresponds to introducing three winding shifts w1, w2 and w3 along the three

tori in the table 1 of eq. (3.1). the direct-channel klein bottle amplitude is

(cid:21)

(8.9)

letting n = 4n the tadpole conditions result in the gauge group so(8)9 and the full

spectrum has n = 4 supersymmetry. the d9 branes are orthogonal to all three directions

used for the breaking and the relevant limits to study here are r1, r2, r3  0. all local
tadpole conditions are automatically satised, thanks to the quadruplet structure of branes,

with the exception of the simultaneous limit r1, r2, r3  0, where new tadpoles ask for
the further breaking so(8)  so(4)  so(4).

9. conclusions

in this paper we have investigated the open descendants of z2  z2 orbifolds where the
orbifold twists are accompanied by various shifts on momentum or winding modes. these

shifts result in a generalization [3] of the eld-theoretical scherk-schwarz mechanism [1] for

42

(partial) supersymmetry breaking. therefore, in all our models the partial breaking of su-

persymmetry may be regarded as spontaneous: extended supersymmetry can be recovered

as some radii tend to innity (zero) in the case of momentum (winding) shifts. we have

encountered new instances of the phenomenon noticed in [6, 7]: the massless spectrum of

branes orthogonal to the breaking direction is unaected at tree level, and therefore has

typically extended supersymmetry. this, in its turn, makes these models not chiral. we

have actually found that in several cases the extended supersymmetry is a property of the

full spectrum, not only of the massless modes, as in the asymmetric orbifolds studied in [10].

we have displayed some models with n = 2  n = 1, n = 4  n = 2, n = 4  n = 1
partial breakings, in addition to the other types, with n = 4  n = 0, n = 2  n = 0
and n = 4  n = 2 breakings, discussed in [6, 7]. in particular, in section 3 we have
collected a number of general results on a class of these shifted orbifolds, to which several

others may be related via various t-dualities and modications of the  projection.

these models display an interesting new geometric feature: since the shifts typically

move the xed points of the orbifolds, branes that would be at xed points in the unshifted

case are actually moved away from them (or, more precisely, from xed tori, in these

z2  z2 models). this gives rise to multiplets of, say, m image branes, that are typically
interchanged by some of the orbifold transformations and are left invariant by others.

thus, in general only some of the orbifold projections aect the partition function, and as

a result the massless modes, and often even the massive ones, have generically extended

supersymmetry. the rank of the corresponding gauge groups is also aected, and is reduced

to 16/m. this phenomenon of brane displacement, discussed for the supersymmetric t 4/z2

model in [21], presents some analogies with the corresponding one induced by quantized

ns  ns antisymmetric tensor eld backgrounds in the compact space [11].

we have also seen how, in general, the shifts make some of tadpole terms in the klein

bottle massive, eliminating the corresponding d5 branes, and we have presented explicit

realizations of models with two, one and no d5 branes in the spectrum. all these models

are not chiral, a feature that can be traced to the lack of some of the breaking terms for

nd or didj strings or, equivalently, to the multiplet structure of the branes.

we have provided an m-theory interpretation of some of the models, that can be related

to scherk-schwarz deformations along the eleventh dimension of m-theory compactied on

an appropriate manifold [23, 6, 7]. in this case, once a local tadpole cancellation condition

is fullled in the coordinate used for the breaking, two sets of branes orthogonal to the

breaking direction may be interpreted as a pair of horava-witten walls.

these models provide examples of partial supersymmetry breaking where gravity can

be decoupled from the brane dynamics. thus, it would be interesting to study in detail

the structure of the eective eld theory and to compare it with the known realizations of

partial supersymmetry breaking [24]. moreover, the issue of radiative corrections is quite

interesting, and was partly addressed, for the gauge couplings, in [25]. for branes parallel to

the breaking direction, the corrections have a logarithmic dependence on the corresponding

radius, while for branes orthogonal to the breaking coordinate, in models with local tadpole

cancellation, they are exponentially small, in agreement with the considerations presented

in [26].
