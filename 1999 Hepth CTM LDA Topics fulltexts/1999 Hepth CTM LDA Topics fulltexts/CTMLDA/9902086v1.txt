abstract

in this letter we shall discuss a description of non-supersymmetric four-dimensional yang-
mills theory based on type 0 strings recently proposed by klebanov and tseytlin. the
three brane near-horizon geometry allows one to study the uv behaviour of the gauge
theory. following minahan and klebanov and tseytlin we shall discuss how the gravity
solution reproduces logarithmic renormalization of coupling constant ge extracted from
quark-antiquark potential and then show that eective coupling constant gm describing
monopole-antimonopole interactions is of zero-charge type and dirac condition gegm = 1
is scale invariant in logarithmic approximation.

1 introduction

non-perturbative description of yang-mills elds in four dimensions is still one of the most
challenging problems in modern theoretical physics. one of the most popular views is that
in the large n limit this description must be based on some kind of string theory. in spite
of the huge amount of work on the subject in the last two decades the proper description
of su(n) gauge theories in the large n limit is still an open problem. nevertheless, it
was a remarkable progress in the last two years which gave us a deeper understanding of
non-perturbative aspects of gauge theory using new ideas in string theory. the duality
of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills to ten dimensional supergravity on ads5  s5
[1][2][3] has been used to obtain exact results in the large n limit of the strongly coupled
superconformal gauge theory. this theory has vanishing beta function and is realized as
the world-volume theory of n coincident d3-branes of type iib string theory. this set of
branes causes the near horizon geometry of ads5  s5 and the classical type iib theory
can be approximated by the compactied supergravity in the limit iib  0, gef f large
but xed.
the interaction between charged particles has been analyzed in this context. the
massless sources might be delicate to deal with, since their long-range elds are exponen-
tially suppressed due to conformal invariance. hence, the eorts have been concentrated
on the study of massive electric and magnetic particles. the computation of the nambu-
goto action in an ads background for a static string conguration allowed rey and yee
[4] and maldacena [5] to nd the coulomb potential between quark and antiquarks at
zero temperature. some results have been also obtained for nite temperature [6], [7], [8]
where a new conning branch appears. in [9] minahan extended the results of nite tem-
perature to the cases of monopole-antimonopole and monopole-quark interactions. here,
he nds an attractive coulomb force for the monopole-antimonopole pair as a function of
the coupling manifestly dual under the transformation ge  1/gm. therefore, the dirac
condition corresponding to the gauge theory has arised as a result of stringy computations.
the number of interesting predictions due to the ads/cft conjecture has led to
do research into a possible extension to the non-supersymmetric case. by heating up
a maximally supersymmetric gauge theory all the supersymmetries get broken. in this
approach the gauge theory is dual to near-extremal branes whose near-horizon geometry
corresponds to a black hole in ads space [7][10]. recently, a dierent approach was
suggested by polyakov [11] : the type 0 string theory [12] in d  10 could be used to
extend the ads/cft duality to non-supersymmetric non-conformal eld theories [11].
this idea inspired the conjecture of klebanov and tseytlin: the existence of a duality
between the non-supersymmetric four dimensional su(n) gauge theory coupled to 6
adjoint scalars elds and a background of type 0 string theory involving a non-vanishing
tachyon eld [13].

the presence of such a tachyon instability could seem fatal. however it disappears
due to a non-perturbative mechanism and the type 0 theory can be used to describe a

1

tachyon-free gauge theory. in this non-supersymmetric theory the coupling constant is
expected to depend on scale. nevertheless, the linear logarithmically dependence with
the scale which should appear for the eective coupling constant in accordance with the
short-distance behaviour of the gauge theory [14] does not agree with the squared log
dependence found for the eective string coupling [15], [16].

in order to shed some light to this puzzle we will study in this letter the leading order
for the eective electric and magnetic coupling constants. in section 2 we describe a near-
horizon geometry in type 0b theory caused by a set of n electric d3-branes. in section 3
we will obtain following calculations of minachan [15] (see also [16]) the running electric
coupling constant ge(l) from the computation of wilson loop describing quark-antiquark
pair.
in section 4 we will use a similar method based on the dbi action for a d-
string to study the magnetic coupling constant gm(l) describing monopole-antimonopole
interaction and obtain the result that dirac condition ge(l)gm(l) = 1 is scale invariant
as it is expected from s-duality.

2 near-horizon geometry for the type 0b electrically

charged d3-brane

in the near-horizon limit the iib string theory has the geometry of ads5  s5 with
a self-dual 5-form whose ux through the s5 sphere xes the charge of the solution. this
theory has been proved to be dual to the n=4 supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory on
the boundary s4  s5 whose conformal invariance is due to the non-running dilaton.
however, in type 0b string theory this conformal invariance is broken. this model
has a closed string tachyon, all the fermionic partners have been removed and the r-r
sector doubled. this doubling seems to be crucial for the theory to describe a tachyon-free
gauge theory. this theory also have d-branes [17]. the coupling of the tachyon eld t to
the r  r nform gauge eld strength shifts the eective mass of t stabilizing in such a
way the supergravity background [13].
the ansatz for the metric corresponding to the type 0b electrically charged d3-brane

background proposed in [13] is the following

ds2 = e

2 5d2 + e 1

2 dx2

|| + e

1

2 d2

(2.1)

where ,  and  are functions of , parameter related to the radial direction u transverse
to the 3-brane world-volume x||. then the action for the model can be described by a
toda mechanical system

in this potential the rst term comes from the tachyon mass term m 2 = 1

tachyon eld and f (t ) a function given by

f (t ) = 1 + t +

1
2

t 2 + o(t 3).

(2.5)

for a large number of branes, the mass of the tachyon can be neglected and the tachyon
can be shown to be a maximum of the function (2.5), f (t ) = 0. then,

t = tvac = 1,

f (t ) =

it is clear that if t = 0 we get the constant dilaton and decoupled  and  elds

 = 0, e = 2q, e = 21/2,  =

(2.6)

(2.7)

which leads to the standard r  r d3-brane solution [18]. however, when t is nonzero
we can just nd approximate solutions. in the uv the dilaton is expected to be slowly
varying, at least compared to  and . under this assumption, minahan [15] solved the
equations of motion of (2.2) for  and  and found

e = c1, e = c21/2,

(2.8)

c1 = 2q and c2 = 2 being two constants in a rst order approximation. then, using
(2.8) as inputs he obtained that

exp(cid:18)

,

(2.9)

2 /(t 2c1), is a leading order solution of the equation of motion for the
with c0 = 8c 5
dilaton. the integration constant 0 is assumed to be 0 >> 1 to assure that the gauge
theory length scale is much greater that the string scale. from (2.9) we can see that the
gauge theory coupling constant 1/gy m is no longer constant and depends on the energy.
thus, if we take the gauge coupling constant as 1/g = 4/g2
y m , then its leading order
behaviour is

1

= e = 212q(log u/)2

(2.10)

where it has been set  = u4 and  << u is a lower limit for the energy. then, the
coupling constant runs but with the unexpected power two for log u/ instead of the
linear dependence which appears for the eective coupling constant in qcd.

finally the solution (2.9) can be used to computed the leading order correction to c1

and c2

(2.12)

in the einstein frame, ds2
e, the metric (2.12) corresponds to ads5  s5 space
in the large u limit but the lower the energy the more important the corrections are and
the curvature of s5 becomes smaller than that of ads5 leading to a 10 dimensional space
with negative total curvature [15],[16] 2.

s = e/2ds2

as we are interested in the high energy limit we will consider in the following that the
metric in the einstein frame is still that of the ads5  s5 space but in the string frame
we have a running dilaton

which scales as (log u/)n.

3 the quark-antiquark interaction

a pair of massive quark-antiquark in the background of n electric d3-branes can
be realized as a string starting and ending on a d3-brane which has been separated
an innity distance from the set of n branes [5][4]. this separation breaks the group
u(n + 1) to u(n)  u(1) by giving an expectation value < h > to a higgs eld. the
massive w-bosons which appear have a mass proportional to < h > and transform in
the fundamental representation of u(n). they will play the role of quarks.

1in our units  = 1
2 higher order corrections for the einstein metric can be found in [16].

sheet, then the action for the string is

s =

2 z d d qdet gmnx mx n,

(3.1)

gmn being the euclidean metric in (2.13). since we are interested in a static conguration
independent of the 5 modes, we take  = t,  = x where x is a direction along the three-
branes. the action simplies to

where x  = 1, t is a constant due to the integration over t and

(3.3)

is the running dilaton we found in the previous section. notice that, although the
dilaton did not appear explicitly in the original action for the string (3.1) the running
radius of the ads space makes it to enter the game. this fact will be relevant in order
to provide the linear log dependence for the gauge coupling constant.

the action (3.2) does not show any explicit dependence on x and that allows us to

solve its euler-lagrange equation of motion

= 0.

(3.4)

since we are working in the approximation of a large value for log u/, the x log u/ is a
sub-leading correction and the factor e/2 can be thought of as a constant. thus, we can
approach (3.4) to

(3.6)

which leads to

where the leading order of u0, the minimum value of u, is a constant to be determined.
if we consider the quark placed at x = l/2 and the antiquark at x = l/2 the minimum
value for u occurs at x = 0 by symmetry. therefore we can write x as a function of u

(3.8)

now taking into account (3.6), (3.7) and the value for u0 (3.8) we can return to (3.2) to

since  is an uv cuto for the energy  << u0 we can approach

log (yu0/) = log y + log u0/  logl0/l

(3.9)

(3.10)

where we have used the relation (3.8) with l0 = r2
l << l0. therefore we have found that the leading contribution to the energy is

this result is innity because we are including the masses of the quarks which correspond
to strings stretched from the d3-brane at umax to the n d3-branes at u = 0. then, by
integrating the energy up to umax we will subtract the regularized mass and nd that the
remaining energy is nite [5]

eq q =

(3.12)

and, as claimed in [15], the eective coupling between a heavy quark and its antiquark
does show the expected linear dependence

this result leads to reconsider the relation 1/g = 4/g2

the pair of massive monopole-antimonopole in the background of n electric d3-branes
can be simulated in a similar way as the quark-antiquark pair of the previous section. for
the monopole-antimonopole conguration we will take a type 0 electric d-string with both
ends on a d3-brane separated an innity distance from the set of n branes. the same
approach was used in [9] in case of n = 4 superconformal yang-mills theory. the world
sheet action for the d-string spread in the 01 plane is the born-infeld action 3

s =

2 z dtdx eqdet gmnx mx n,

(4.1)

gmn being the euclidean metric in (2.13). we will suppose a static conguration inde-
pendent of the 5 modes and, in such a way, this action can be written as follows

(4.2)

(4.3)

it is remarkable to notice that this action diers from that of the quark-antiquark (3.2)
just in the factor e. this factor will be crucial to obtain a dierent log dependence
for the monopole eective gauge coupling constant. again the running radius of the ads
space changes the dilatonic factor of the action providing, as we will see, the linear log
dependence for the eective magnetic coupling.

the action (4.2) does not depend explicitly on x either and the euler-lagrange equa-

tion of motion for this variable reads

e/2

we can suppose again that the factor e/2 has a slow variation and use

(4.5)

to be able to write x as a function of u (3.7) and to x the value of u0 (3.8). hence
the minimum of the energy for the monopole-antimonopole conguration happens to be

3 a tachyon-dependent function k(t ) might appear as a multiplicative factor [13]. however, in case
of a constant tachyon it is not likely to play a relevant role in the determination of the log dependence of
the gauge coupling constant.

the same constant as that of the quark-antiquark case in a rst approximation. however,
from (3.4) and (4.4) we expect them to dier due to higher order corrections.

now we can plug the results (3.7) and (3.8) into the expression (4.2) to obtain the

in this case, the innity is due to the masses of the monopoles, d-strings joining the

will allow us to subtract the regularized mass and obtain a nite result

5 conclusion and acknowledgments

in this letter we showed that the dual gravity description of non-supersymmetric gauge
theories conjectured recently has been used in this paper to check that dirac condition is
rg invariant (at least in a logarithmic approximation) which is a necessary element for
the self-consistency of the theory. we also see that in this theory the running coupling
constant is rather proportional to exp(/2) than to exp() as one could expect. the

8

fact that there is a square of logarithm in exp() was crucial to obtain the correct
renormalization of the magnetic coupling constant. we did not answer the question why
the coupling constant is square root of what we might expect naively and this seems to be
open important question. it will be nice to nd running coupling constant in this theory
using other approaches, for example studying instanton eects and we plan to return to
this issue in the future.
