abstract

cylindrical gravitational waves of einstein gravity are described by an integrable
system (ernst system) whose quantization is a long standing problem. we propose
to bootstrap the quantum theory along the following lines: the quantum theory is
described in terms of matrix elements e.g. of the metric operator between spectral-
transformed multi-vielbein congurations. these matrix elements are computed
exactly as solutions of a recursive system of functional equations, which in turn is
derived from an underlying quadratic algebra. the poisson algebra emerging in its
classical limit links the spectral-transformed vielbein and the non-local conserved
charges and can be derived from rst principles within the ernst system.

among the noteworthy features of the quantum theory are: (i) the issue of
(non-)renormalizability is sidestepped and (ii) there is an apparently unavoidable
spontaneous breakdown of the sl(2, ir) symmetry that is a remnant of the 4d
dieomorphism invariance in the compactied dimensions.

1. introduction

attempts to construct a quantum theory of gravity based on a functional integral formu-
lation have so far been unsuccessful. initially this was thought to be a breakdown only
of its perturbative expansion. meanwhile various reasonably looking discretized versions
of the functional integral have (in all likelihood) failed to produce a continuum limit of
the desired form. this may indicate the necessity to incorporate specic forms of mat-
ter, it may indicate a failure of the functional integral approach, or the analogy to the
quantization of conventional eld theories may just be physically misleading altogether.
in any case it seems desirable to locate the source of the problem more clearly by study-
ing model situations suciently complex to make (non-)renormalizability an issue, but
tractable enough to be mathematically controllable.

an intriguing such system is the ernst system, an innite dimensional subsector (the two
killing vector eld reduction) of the full phase space of general relativity; see [1][6] and
references therein. together with its abelian truncation it has become a prominent testing
ground to explore certain quantum issues of gravity; see e.g. [7][13]. the reduced phase
space is equivalent to that of a two-dimensional dieomorphism invariant eld theory.
the latter couples 2d gravity via a dilaton eld  to a 2d matter system equivalent
to the noncompact o(1, 2) nonlinear sigma-model. this means, the matter degrees of
freedom are mappings n :   h2 from the 2d spacetime manifold  to the hyperboloid
h2 = {n = (n0, n1, n2)  ir1,2 | n  n = (n0)2  (n1)2  (n2)2 = 1, n0 > 0}.
if h
denotes the (lorentzian) metric on  and r(2)(h) its scalar curvature, the action of the
two-dimensional system is given by

s =z

d2xh(cid:26)r(2)(h) +

1
2

 hn  n(cid:27) ,

(1.1)

where    is the bilinear form on ir1,2. the relation to the coset action principles
usually employed in the literature and that to the original ernst variables is described in
appendix a.

depending on the signature of , this sector physically describes either stationary ax-
isymmetric solutions or gravitational waves with additional symmetries. the latter case
comprises  depending on the norm of   the gowdy universes, colliding plane wave
solutions, and (the case considered here) cylindrical gravitational waves. the original
einstein-rosen waves form a collinearly polarized subsector, they have n1  0, and are
thus described by the abelian o(1, 1) subtheory of (1.1).

at rst sight, the action (1.1) seems perfectly amenable to conventional quantum eld
theoretical techniques. upon closer inspection however, one is quickly led to address the
following questions:

(i) can one expect 2d conformal invariance to be unbroken?

1

(ii) what is the physics of the at space sigma-model with target space h2?

(iii) is the theory (1.1) renormalizable in perturbation theory?

let us briey comment on these issues:

(i) flat space non-linear sigma-models are known to exhibit dynamical mass genera-
tion, destroying the 2d conformal invariance of the classical theory. in the gauge
h = e2 (where  is the at 2d minkowski metric) the classical system (1.1)
likewise exhibits a conformal symmetry, and o-hand there is no reason why it
should not again be broken in the quantum theory. rather, there are strong indica-
tions for a dynamical breaking of the conformal symmetry from other 2d quantum
gravity models [14, 15]. in any case, it seems advisable not to employ 2d conformal
invariance as a guiding principle to construct the quantum theory.

(ii) although sigma-models with a non-compact target space have been studied for some
time [16][21], even basic qualitative features are unknown. perturbative renormal-
izability in the presence of an infrared cuto should largely parallel that of the
compact case [22]. however the free eld fock space carrying a nonlinear realiza-
tion of the o(1, n) group action has indenite metric [21] and the projection onto a
physical state space is not fully understood. likewise the extent to which the results
[23, 24] on the infrared niteness carry over has to be examined. one might hope a
non-perturbative construction to be feasible via the lattice approach. specically,
the results of a lowest order large n analysis of the o(1, n) models [16, 17, 18] sug-
gest that a non-trivial continuum limit theory might emerge when using spacelike
hyperbolic variables n  n = 1/g0, g0 > 0, and sending the bare coupling constant
g0 to zero. (classically this is the region where the hamiltonian density fails to be
positive semi-denite.) relying on these indications one would further guess that
the resulting qft is massive, has unbroken o(1, n) symmetry, a positive denite
physical hilbert space, and a unitary s-matrix. however this scenario has not been
corroborated so far.

(iii) here, renormalizability should mean in particular that the target space geometry
h2 is left intact by the renormalization process. in conformal gauge one may take
 as a loop counting parameter, in which case the model is 1-loop renormalizable
in the background eld expansion [25]. for higher loops however one cannot expect
o-hand that the results for the generalized riemannian sigma-models [26, 27] used
in the context of string theory, employing a much weaker notion of renormalizability,
will carry over. let us emphasize that the answer is not automatic even if one takes
the (ultraviolet and infrared) renormalizability of the non-compact sigma-models
in at space for granted. one way to see this is to x the 2d dieomorphism
invariance in (1.1) completely and to identify  with one of the coordinates on  (this
corresponds to the 4d weyl coordinates). then (1.1) becomes a at space action,
though with an explicit coordinate dependence which in particular destroys poincare

2

invariance. clearly the presumed renormalizability of the poincare invariant at
space theory is not very indicative for the behavior of the other system.

in summary none of the conventional quantum eld theoretical techniques presents itself
to construct a quantum theory for (1.1). we propose therefore to bootstrap the quantum
theory from structures linked to its classical integrability. in upshot the quantum theory is
described in terms of matrix elements e.g. of the metric operator between certain spectral-
transformed multi-vielbein congurations. these matrix elements are described exactly
as solutions of a recursive system of functional equations, which in turn are derived from
an underlying dynamical algebra. the poisson algebra emerging in its classical limit
links the spectral-transformed vielbein and the non-local conserved charges and can be
derived from rst principles within the ernst system. schematically one can summarize
the approach as follows:

dynamical algebra 

functional equations

exact matrix elements

for sequences of

meromorphic functions 

in (renormalized)
quantum theory

a

we rst briey describe the ingredients of the above scheme and then comment on why
we expect it to yield a viable quantum theory for the ernst system.
the data for the dynamical algebra d are: a solution r of the yang-baxter equation, a
real parameter , and a choice of -operation. there are two sets of generators t ()b
and wa(), where   ic, and the indices a, b refer to a basis in a nite dimensional vector
space. the algebra d = d(r, ,) associated with the data is basically the most general
simple associative algebra, where simple means that all ideals have been divided out.
in the case at hand the data are as follows: r is the rational sl2 r-matrix multiplied with
a scalar function that ensures a suitable unitarity and crossing condition. the parameter
 vanishes, which corresponds to the case where the algebra has an enlarged center.
the latter roughly speaking ensures that the quantum theory has the same number of
dynamical degrees of freedom as the classical theory. for any other value of  this
correspondence would be violated and degrees of freedom transversal to the reduced phase
space would become dynamical (without describing a consistent bigger portion of the full
phase space). the possible -structures turn out to fall into several equivalence classes;
the proper one is selected by matching it against that of the classical poisson algebra.
once the correct dynamical algebra d has been identied one considers linear functionals
d  x  h|x|i  ic over d, where the vectors h| and |i are characterized by
the conditions: t +()b
ah|. the  are numerical
matrices subject to certain consistency conditions, and in general h|i = 0. given such
a functional one can introduce the sequence of functions

a|i and h|t ()b

a|i = +b

a = b

fan...a1(n, . . . , 1) = h|wan(n) . . . wa1(1)|i , n  1 .

(1.2)

the relations of the dynamical algebra then imply that this sequence satises a recursive
system of functional equations, where the consistency of the underlying algebra ensures the

3

consistency of the functional equations. conversely the original functional over d provides
an abstract solution to the functional equations. the functional equations can be grouped
into two sets (i) and (ii). the set (i) characterizes the functions (1.2) for xed n, the
second set (ii) prescribes how the solutions of (i) are arranged into sequences. essentially
(ii) stipulates that the functions (1.2) have simple poles whenever two -variables dier
by a xed purely imaginary number (which in physical units equals il2
pl/lz, lpl being the
planck length and lz the unit length along the symmetry axis) and that the residues at
these poles are linked to a function (1.2) in n  2 variables.
having arrived at the functional equations one can in principle forget about their deriva-
tion and take them as the starting point. the aim then is to construct explicit solutions in
the form of sequences of meromorphic functions f (n) = fan...a1(n, . . . , 1). to understand
their physical interpretation the analogy to the form factor approach [28] to relativistic
integrable qfts is useful. for these systems a similar interplay between a dynamical
algebra and a system of functional equations (the so-called form factor equations) exists
[29, 30]. the solutions f (n) in that case describe the form factors of the qft, i.e. matrix
elements of some local operator between the physical vacuum and an asymptotic multi-
particle state.
in the case at hand of course a conventional quantum eld theoretical
framework is not available; in particular scattering states in the usual sense are unlikely
to exist. nevertheless the functions f (n) can still be interpreted as the matrix elements
of some operator between a ground state and a multi-wa() conguration. from the
analysis of the semi-classical limit one nds that the wa() are the quantum counterparts
of a spectral-transformed vielbein variable. moreover the analogy to the icip1 system
(cf. appendix a) suggests to view them as conned degrees of freedom rather than gen-
erators of scattering states. similarly as in the form factor approach the identication of
the operator whose matrix elements are obtained in that way requires external input. of
course identication here to some extent just means making contact to a conventional
quantum eld theoretical formulation where the operator in question is constructed as a
composite operator from a set of fundamental eld operators. as explained before such
a more conventional formulation is presently not available for the ernst system, so that
the identication of the operator underlying a sequence f (n) in this sense has to be left
for future work.

note that at no stage any renormalization procedure entered. this is a known, yet striking,
feature of the form factor approach. mathematically it can be understood in terms of the
extreme rigidity of the underlying dynamical algebra, which simply does not allow for
interesting continuous automorphisms that could account for a renormalization process.
the same is true in the present setting and suggests that the functions f (n) indeed are
exact matrix elements that do not require renormalization.

physically our most important nding is an apparently unavoidable spontaneous break-
down of the global sl(2, ir) invariance that is a remnant of the original 4d dieomorphism
invariance in the killing coordinates. technically this emerges because the consistency
conditions on the matrices  mentioned before eq. (1.2) do not admit a sl(2, ir) in-
variant solution. as a consequence the functions f (n) are invariant only under a maximal

4

compact so(2) subgroup. despite the trivial technical origin the symmetry breaking is
a genuine dynamical feature intimately linked to the structure of the dynamical algebra;
in particular it disappears in the semi-classical limit.

as explained before we also regard it as more likely than not, that the 2d conformal
invariance of the classical theory (1.1) will be broken in the quantum theory. a-fortiori
then also the dieomorphism invariance in the two non-killing coordinates of the ernst
system will be lost. together both remnants of the original 4d dieomorphism invariance
(i.e. that it the killing and in the non-killing coordinates) appear to be broken in the
quantum theory for dynamical reasons. being a eld theoretical phenomenon that does
not have a counterpart in systems with nitely many degrees of freedom, the result may
well have signicance beyond the symmetry-reduced theory.

in the next section, the dynamical algebra d is
the article is organized as follows.
introduced and the functional equations (i), (ii) for the matrix elements (1.2) are derived.
in section 3 we discuss the semi-classical limit of the construction and explain the relation
to the phase space of the classical ernst system. also various aspects of the symmetry
breaking are detailed. a compilation of useful action principles for the matter sigma-model
is deferred to appendix a. in section 4 a solution technique for the functional equations
(i), (ii) is described. we adapt techniques from the algebraic bethe ansatz which are
summarized in appendix b. in particular, the apparently new concept of sequential
bethe roots and bethe vectors is introduced. finally a list of explicit solutions for the
functions (1.2) with n  4 is collected in appendix c.

2. dynamical algebra and functional equations

here we describe the dynamical algebra and derive the functional equations (i), (ii) for
the objects (1.2). the discussion is naturally organized into two steps. first an algebra
di is introduced giving rise to the functional equations (i). then di is shown to still
contain two-sided ideals; the factor algebra obtained by dividing out these ideals is the
full dynamical algebra d and gives rise to the additional functional equations (ii). we
begin by describing di and initially keep the data (r, ,) generic.

2.1 w -extended yangian doubles

the algebras di are centrally extended yangian doubles dy(r) with generators t ()b
supplemented by generators wa(). we write w y (r, ,), where r is a is a solution of
the yang-baxter equation satisfying unitarity and crossing. further  is a real parameter
and  refers to a choice of -operation. lower indices refer to a basis in a nite dimensional
vector space v ; upper indices refer to the dual basis, where indices are raised and lowered

by means of the constant charge conjugation matrix cab and its inverse c ba, associated
with the given r-matrix. for the moment we only need the data r and ; the possible
-operations will be discussed below. to any r-matrix and parameter  one can assign
an associative algebra w y with unity by postulating the following exchange relations
among its generators:

with 12 := 1  2. the parameter h is included for later convenience; it can be given
any non-zero value by a rescaling of the  variables. for convenience we also assume that
real boosts in the  variables are unitarily implemented, i.e. eikx()eik = x( + ),
with   ir, for any generator x() of the algebra. for completeness we also note the
precise form of the yang baxter equation

(2.1)

(2.2)

we add a few remarks. the algebra dy(r) is a well-known structure. for  = 2
it can be viewed as a presentation of the quantum double of some underlying innite
dimensional hopf algebra [31]. the (tw) and (ww) relations are then characteristic for
the intertwining operators between quantum double modules [32, 33]. particular cases

are the yangian double or the quantum double of uq(bg), in which case the parameter 
can be related to the central extension via c = 2i(1  /2). here we do not make use of
the co-algebra structure and always treat  as a real numerical parameter. the case of
the critical level with enlarged center [34, 35] in our conventions corresponds to  = 0; for
the sl2 yangian case it will be studied in detail below.

6

in preparation, we introduce the following quadratic element which turns to play a decisive
role in the w y algebras

in particular,
it follows from these relations that the (generalized) quantum current
d() = c abdab() lies in the center of the algebra w y (r, 0,), for any r-matrix obeying
a standard crossing relation with a symmetric charge conjugation matrix cab. much of
the construction described in the rest of the paper could therefore be transferred to a
fairly general class of innite dimensional quantum algebras.

with the application to the quantum ernst system in mind however we specialize already
at this point to the sl2 yangian r-matrix [36, 37, 38]. its charge conjugation matrix is
anti-symmetric which enforces a slight modication of the above scheme. the relevant
r-matrix is then given by

a, b, ... = 1, 2 ,

(2.8)

next we determine the possible -operations of the wy-algebras with the r-matrix (2.5).
starting with a general linear ansatz one nds

wa() = f a
a wa( + ih)
a = f a
t +()b
a eb
a = (e1)b

t ()b

b t ( + ih/  ih)b
b (f 1)a

a

a t +( + ih/  ih)b
a ,

where e, f are gl(2, ic) matrices satisfying

ee = 11 ,   {1} , f f  = 11 ,

det e  det f = 1 .

(2.9)

(2.10)

any solution of (2.10) yields a consistent -operation (2.9), for any value of . we omitted
a trivial overall shift by a purely imaginary number in the arguments on the right hand
side of (2.9). we also omitted scalar prefactors on the right hand side which can be
removed by a rescaling of the generators. the operator dab() is basically hermitian with
respect to any of the -operations (2.9), (2.10)

dab() = dba( + ih/  2ih) , d() = d( + ih/  2ih) ,
where d() := c abdab() .

(2.11)

clearly, most of these -operations will be equivalent in being related by an automor-
phism of the wy-algebra. such automorphisms are provided by sl(2, ic) basis transfor-
mations wa()  f a
a  f a
a gb
a, f, g  sl(2, ic), under which the
-structure (2.9) transforms covariantly as

a wa(), t ()b

b t ()b

e 7 g1eg ,

 7  ,

f 7 f f f 1 .

(2.12)

it is not hard to classify the inequivalent -structures in the general case. with regard
to the ernst system however we restrict attention to real linear transformations and thus

8

require the matrices e, f to be real. this leaves four cases for the possible -operations,
corresponding to the sign choices sign(det f ) = sign(det e) and   {1}. consider rst
f : if det f = 1 then f = a1, where a  so(2) and j, j = 1, 2, 3, are the pauli
matrices. if det f = 1 then f = 11. in the former case one can achieve f = 3 by a
similarity transformation; in the latter case one can take f = 11, because the sign can be
absorbed either into e or into a rescaling of the generators. it turns out that det f = 1
is the case relevant for the ernst system, so for brevity we consider the possible es only
for det e = 1. the general solution of e2 = 11, e  sl(2, ir), then is readily worked
out. for  = 1 it leaves only e = 11, for  = 1 one nds a two-parameter family of
es; by a similarity transformation each of its members can be mapped onto e = i2. in
summary, we always take f = 11 in (2.9), which leaves only two inequivalent -structures
implemented by real e matrices, namely

 = 1 : e = 11

and

 = 1 : e = i2 .

(2.13)

note that with the second choice the sl(2, ir) basis transformations acting on the upper
index are restricted to the so(2)  sl(2, ir) subgroup leaving e xed.
from now on di will denote the algebra w y (r, 0,) with the r-matrix (2.5), the param-
eter  = 0, and the -operation (2.9) with f = 11 and e given by one of the matrices in
(2.13). the case with  = 1 will turn out to be the one relevant for the ernst system.
often we shall treat the  = 1 case as well in order to emphasize the crucial dierences
entailed by the seemingly minor ip. for convenient reference let us note explicitly

wa() = wa( + ih)
t +()b

a

a = eb
a = eb

b t (  ih)b
b t +(  ih)b
a ,

t ()b

(2.14)

with e as above, as the -operation of di. sl(2, ir) transformations acting on the
lower index are -automorphisms of di, and similarly so(2) rotations acting on the
upper index. generic sl(2, ir) transformations acting on the upper index in contrast
are automorphisms but do not preserve the -structure. rather the matrix e transforms
covariantly as e  g1eg, g  sl(2, ir).
in addition di admits some simple -automorphisms given by -dependent rescalings of
the generators. explicitly

wa()  () wa() , t ()b

a  () t ()b
a ,

(2.15)

are -automorphisms of di provided the scalar functions (), () obey

() = ( + ih) ,

() = ( + ih) ,

9

()(  ih) = 1 .

(2.16)

the last equation in particular entails that () are 2ih periodic functions.

2.2 diagonalizing the center at the critical level  = 0

for  = 0 the quantum current is central. explicitly

[d(1) , wa(2)] = 0 = [d(1) , t (2)b

a] ,

re 21 6= 0 .

(2.17)

the second equation is well known [34]. the rst one follows similarly from (2.4), which
also explains the origin of the cdd-like sinh-prefactor in (2.5).1 since d() is central it
is natural to search for representations of di on which d() acts like a multiple of the
unit operator. the fock space representations of the yangian double at the critical level
inherited from a free eld realization [39, 35] do not have this property. experience from
other contexts suggests to search for appropriate representations in terms of functionals
over the algebra di.
specically we consider vector functionals (called t-invariant)

di  x  hxi = h|x|i ,

built from a pair of vectors |i and h| satisfying

t +()b

a|i = +()b

a|i ,

h|t ()b

a = ()b

ah| ,

(2.18)

(2.19)

where () are numerical matrices which according to (t1), (t2) carry one-dimensional
representations of the yangian algebra y (sl2) respectively. this implies () = ()
with 2ih-periodic scalar functions () and constant matrices , satisfying the relations
()(  ih) = 1 and ccdc
b = cab. it is natural to supplement the conditions on
() by the rst condition in (2.16). a rescaling (2.15) of the t  generators then allows
one to dispense of the -dependence of the  matrices in (2.19). henceforth we shall use
constant  matrices. hermiticity h(x)i = hxi then imposes the conditions

ad

h+b

(2.20)

1however, the relations (2.17) do not imply that the antisymmetric part of dab() decouples alge-

braically. dening

mab() :=

i
2

(dab() + dba()) ,

the relations (2.4) (at  = 0) do not hold with dab() replaced by mab(). we shall see in section 3 how
to separate the symmetric part of dab() in the classical limit.

natural choices are:  = 11 for  = 1, and  = 11, + = e for  = 1, in which case

clearly any t -invariant functional (2.18) is uniquely determined by its values on strings
of w-generators, for which we introduce some extra notation

a, respectively.

a = eb

fa() := fan...a1(n, . . . , 1) := hwan(n) . . . wa1(1)i ,

(2.23)

where re ij 6= 0, i 6= j,  = (n, . . . , 1), a = (an, . . . , a1). sometimes also the shorthand
f (n) for the value of h  i on a string of n w -generators will be used. with these denitions
one computes

hwan(n) . . . wak+1(k+1) d(0) wak(k) . . . wa1(1)i

(2.24)

(2.25)

implicit in (2.25) are two important features reecting the fact that d(0) is central:
the right hand side of (2.25) is k independent and for xed   icn and varying 0  ic
the t (0|) form a one-parameter family of commuting matrices. hence they can be
simultaneously diagonalized and on the eigenvectors d(0) will act like a multiple of the
unit operator. we are thus lead to restrict attention to those functionals (2.18) (or later
a subset thereof) for which the functions (2.23) obey

t (0|)b

a fb() =  (0|)fa() .

(2.26)

11

we note the following hermiticity properties of the t -matrices and their eigenvalues:

ht (0|)b
ai
 (0|) =   (

= t (

0  2ih|t + ih)bt
at ,

0  2ih|t + ih) ,

(2.27)

which follow from (2.11), (2.24) and the general hermiticity condition h(x)i = hxi.
the notation is t = (1, . . . , n), at = (a1, . . . , an), etc. a further important property
of the eigenvalues  (0|) of (2.26) is

 (k  ih|)  (k  2ih|) = 1 ,

k = 1, . . . , n .

(2.28)

to derive this, consider the matrix t (0|)t (0  ih|), which describes the action of
d(0)d(0  ih) within the matrix elements (2.23). then

[t (0|)t (0  ih|)]b

= b

a ,

k = 1, . . . , n ,

(2.29)

a(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)0=kih

as may be veried by direct computation from (2.25).

the matrix b
a in (2.25) can be thought of as describing the deviation from the sl(2, ir)
symmetry. in particular t (0|) is invariant only under the subgroup of sl(2, ir) matrices
obeying
(2.30)
for  = 1 one may take  = 11 and the condition is empty. for  = 1 the solutions
of (2.30) can be seen to generate a maximal compact subgroup so(2)  sl(2, ir). this
holds irrespective of any further constraints on the matrix , but for the reasons outlined
in section 2.3 we take  to be real. of course  still has to obey the constraints in (2.21)
and the most general real solution to them may be parameterized as

c = b

c
a b

c c
a .

(, ) :=  sh
 ch  sh! ,
 1

 ch

0 6=   ir,   ir .

(2.31)

an sl(2, ir) basis transformation in (2.24) maps  in (2.25) onto gg1, g  sl(2, ir).
the transformed  matrix still obeys the constraints in (2.21) and hence can be parame-
terized as in (2.31), however with dierent values for  and . the  matrices therefore
dene a conjugacy class in sl(2, ir). the transfer matrix t and its eigenvalues depend
on the representative gg1, while the eigenvalues are class-functions, i.e. depend only
on the conjugacy class. in particular the eigenvalues of  itself are i, independent of 
and . for any xed matrix  the solutions of (2.30) then generate the missing compact
conjugacy class of sl(2, ir). explicitly the solutions of (2.30) are given by

b

a() = b

a cos  + (, )b

a sin  for

 = 1 , 0   < 2 .

(2.32)

12

as anticipated, they generate an so(2) subgroup of sl(2, ir). furthermore, they satisfy
c bmn

a(). the invariance of t (0|) is expressed by

m()cna = b

t (0|)c

a b1

c1() . . . bn

cn() = c1

a1() . . . cn

an() t (0|)b
c .

(2.33)

in particular, (2.33) allows one to break up the eigenvalue problem (2.26) into subsectors
of xed so(2) charge; cf. appendix b.
the diagonalization (2.26) of t of course is the object of the bethe ansatz. we shall be
interested in solutions which are in addition equivariant with respect to the usual repre-
sentation of the permutation group sn on the space of tensor-valued functions. whence
we require

 s  sn .
it suces to specify the action of the generators s1, . . . , sn1 of sn:

fa() = ls()b

a fb(s1) ,

sj(n, . . . , 1) = (n, . . . , j, j+1, . . . , 1) ,

1  j  n1 ,

and the product

lss() = ls()ls(s1) ,  s, s  sn .

(2.34)

(2.35)

(2.36)

not surprisingly, the system (2.26) is compatible with (2.34) provided the eigenvalues
 (0|) are completely symmetric in  = (n, . . . , 1), which we henceforth assume to be
the case. it suces to verify the asserted compatibility for the generators of sn; this in
turn follows from the identities

lsj (sj)a

b = t (0|sj)b
a ,

1  j  n1 .

(2.37)

2.3 further properties of the eigenvectors

the joint solutions (2.26) and (2.34) enjoy a number of other remarkable properties. first
they are also solutions to an asymptotic form of the deformed knizhnik-zamolodchikov
equations (kze) [40, 28], where in the present conventions 2i(1  /2) parameterizes
the level. the critical level  = 0 corresponds to the limiting case where these equations
degenerate into an eigenvalue problem for mutually commuting matrices qk, namely (see
e.g. [41])

with

qk()b

a fb() = qk() fa() ,

qk()b

a := d

c t c

ak (k|n, . . . , k+1)bn...bk+1

an...ak+1t bk

d (k|k1, . . . , 1)bk1...b1
ak1...a1 .

(2.38)

(2.39)

13

to see the relation to (2.26) note

t (0|)b

a(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)0=kih

= qk()b

a .

(2.40)

hence (2.38) is a consequence of (2.26) with qk() =  (k  ih|). the converse is also
true as we show in appendix b2. the t eigenvalue problem (2.26) and the seemingly
weaker qk eigenvalue problem (2.38) therefore are equivalent for  = 0.
for  6= 0 the deformed kze has been found to have an algebraic counterpart [30]:
supplementing the relations of w y(r) by

wa( + ih/) = cmnt ( + ih/)m

a wk() t +( + ih/  ih)n

l c kl ,

(2.41)

the matrix elements (2.23) automatically solve the deformed kze with level i(2  /),
or equivalently a cyclic equation with shift parameter . moreover the relation (2.41)
endows the algebra with a modular structure characteristic for a quantum system at
nite temperature 1/. here we show that much of this structure survives in the limit
  0.
we begin by showing that the joint solutions of (2.26) and (2.34) also enjoy the following
cyclic property

(2.42)
here  is the coxeter element  = sn1 . . . s1  sn, acting by cyclic permutation
(n, . . . , 1) = (1, n, . . . , 2) on elements of icn and

fa() = ()b

afb(1) .

()b

a :=   (n  2ih|) b1

anbn

an1 . . . b2
a1 .

(2.43)

afa(1),
of course one could also have used (2.34) to obtain the relation fa() = l()b
where l() is the representation matrix of   sn dened by (2.35), (2.36). consistency
is ensured by the fact that

l()b

a fb(1) = ()b

a fb(1) ,

(2.44)

on the joint solutions of (2.26) and (2.34). in other words, although () and l() are
distinct as matrices, they act in the same way on the solutions of (2.26) and (2.34). this
follows from

fa()

(2.28)

=

(2.25)

(2.35),(2.36)

a fb()

d (n|n1, . . . , 1)bn1...b1
an1...a1d fb()

an l1(1)b

an1...a1 fb()

14

and together with (2.34) we obtain (2.42) and (2.44). one may check that consistently
the matrix t has the cyclic property

t (0|)b

an1...a1c c
a = t (0|1)bn1...b1d
a t (0|1)b

= ()a

an (1)bn

d

a 1()b

b .

(2.45)

from here one can show that the cyclic equation (2.42) is in fact equivalent to the qk
eigenvalue problem: specializing (2.45) to 0 = k  ih yields cyclicity relations for the
qk matrices and their eigenvalues

qk1()b

a = qk()bn1...b1d

an1...a1c c

an(1)bn
d ,

qk1() =  (k  ih|) = qk() .

(2.46)

in particular modulo the exchange relations (2.34) the eigenvalue equation (2.38) for
k = n, say, entails all others. on the other hand from the computation before (2.45) one
also sees that the cyclic equation (2.42) and the qn eigenvalue equation are equivalent.
combining both facts shows the asserted equivalence of (2.38) and (2.42).

a further property of the qk matrices and their eigenvalues is unravelled by iterating the
cyclic equation (2.42)

nyk=1

an . . . b1

a1fb() ,

qk() fa() = ()n bn
nyj=1

a = ()n

[q1() . . . qn()]b

bj

aj ,

(2.47)

where the second equation follows from the rst one together with the fact that for generic
s the matrices qk have maximal rank. from (2.28) one nds qk()qk(ih) = . finally
the qk() have two properties that are readily seen only in the bethe ansatz construction
relegated to appendix b: for real  they are pure phases and the phase is a gradient; see
also [41, 42]. explicitly, qk() = qk()1 and

qk() = eik() , with k() = (nk) , k = 1, . . . , n ,

(2.48)

where () = () := i ln  (n ih|). the fact that the qk() are pure phases is linked
to having  in (2.21) chosen to be real.

real -matrices are also natural because they allow one to introduce a quadratic form
on the space of solutions to (2.26), (2.34). consider the following quadratic form on the
space of v n-valued functions

hf, gi =z dn fa()c abgb() .

(2.49)

15

it is manifestly hermitian hf, gi = hg, fi and sl(2, ir) invariant. equations (2.34),
(2.38), and (2.42) give rise to symmetry operations which are unitary with respect to h , i
in the sense that

hf, gi = hf , gi
f 
a() = ls()b

for

a fb(s1) ,

s  sn ,

a() = qk()1 qk()b
f 

a fb() ,

f 
a() = ()b

a fb(1) .

(2.50a)

(2.50b)

(2.50c)

hence, for real b
a, h , i induces a quadratic form h , isol on the space of functions f 
which are the joint solutions of (2.34), (2.26)  (2.34), (2.38)  (2.34), (2.42).
now let us return to the algebraic description. since for  = 0 (and only then) the kze
(2.38) and the cyclic equation (2.42) are consequences of the t -eigenvalue problem (2.26)
and (2.34) one expects that in the algebra di extra algebraic relations hold which imply
(2.38), (2.42) for the matrix elements (2.23). this is indeed the case and the relevant
relations are

!= f ,

cmnt ()m

a wk() t +(  ih)n

l c kl = wa() d(  ih) ,

d(  2ih)d(  ih)wa() = wa() .

(2.51a)

(2.51b)

the rst relation can be veried simply by pushing t  to the right using (tw). equation
(2.51b) then is required for compatibility with the -operations (2.9). indeed, applying 
to (2.51a) yields

cmnt (  ih)m

k wl() t +(  2ih)n

ac kl = d(  2ih) wa() .

(2.52)

employing associativity and (t2) one recovers (2.51a) i (2.51b) holds. inserting now
(2.51a) into the k-th position of a matrix element (2.23) precisely produces the k-th kze-
equation (2.38). using the (ww) relations any of them can be seen to be equivalent to
the cyclic equation (2.42). finally the algebraic consistency relation (2.51b) amounts to
(2.29) when used within the matrix elements (2.23).

let us summarize the construction until here. for  = 0, the quantum current lies in the
center of the algebra di. searching for t-invariant functionals (2.18), (2.19) on which it
acts like a multiple of the unit operator, leads to the eigenvalue problem (2.26). we were
interested in those solutions which also enjoy the r-matrix exchange relations (2.34) and
found that they have a number of remarkable bonus properties. most notably, they satisfy
the asymptotic form (2.38) of the deformed kze, which we showed to be equivalent to
the cyclic equation (2.42). moreover on the space of permutation equivariant functions

16

(2.34) the three requirements: t eigenvalue problem (2.26), qk eigenvalue problem, and
the cyclic condition (2.42) are all equivalent. the actual solution e.g. of the t eigenvalue
problem (2.26), (2.34) is relegated to appendix b. all this was for a xed number n
of variables j. next we show that the eigenvectors and eigenvalues for dierent n can
naturally be arranged into sequences.

2.4 sequences of eigenvectors

apart from the non-trivial center, the algebra di = w y (r, 0,) contains further two-
sided ideals which should be divided out. the following relations (r) can be checked to
arise in this way and we suspect them to be the only ones2

(r)

wa( + ih)  wb() = () cab d(  ih) ,
c abwa(  ih)  wb() = (  ih) d(  2ih) ,

where the function () satises () = (). under the action of the -automorphism
(2.15) () changes according to

()  ()

()( + ih)
()+( + ih)

.

(2.53)

we will later comment on specic choices for (). the algebra di where in addition the
relations (r) are imposed, is our complete dynamical algebra d.
the operator product wa(1)wb(2) turns out to be singular as 21  ih, with a rst
order pole. the   in (r) indicates a normal product dened roughly by taking the
residue at the pole. a more precise denition will be given below in terms of its action
within the t-invariant functionals. for the moment we are only interested in the algebraic
properties of the relations (r).

a stronger, uncontracted version of the second relation is

wa(  ih)  wb() = (  ih)dab(  2ih) .

(2.54)

let us momentarily denote these relations by (r1), (r2) and (r3), respectively. recall
that the exchange relations (tw) are valid also for re 12 = 0, while for the (ww)
relations these points are a-priori excluded. consider the following formal extension of
(ww) to 12 = ih,

wa( + ih)  wb() = rcd

ab(ih) wd()  wc( + ih) ,

2it appears to be a general rule that reducibility of a tensor product of fundamental representations is
always caused by a pole in the r-matrix [43, 44]. according to (tw) the wa play the role of intertwiners
between two such representations.

(2.55)

17

the extra minus sign of (2.55) with respect to (ww) is in accordance with the residue
interpretation of the  -product. then:

(r2) = (r3) by means of
(r1)  (r2), (r3) by means of

(2.51), (tw) ,

(2.55) .

(2.56)

the rst implication can be seen by starting from wa( ih) wb(), replacing wa( ih)
in favor of d(  2ih)1cmnt (  ih)m
l c kl, then using (tw)
to move t + to the right and nally applying (r2). thus (r2) and (r3) are equivalent
in d and both are readily seen to be formally equivalent to (r1) once one is allowed to
use (2.55). in order to avoid potential troubles with the formal identity (2.55), however,
we postulate both equations (r) independently, keeping in mind that they are formally
related by (2.55).

a wk(  ih)t +(  2ih)n

we can now restore topological concepts by calling a t-invariant functional (2.18) analytic
if:

(i) the dependence of the values f (n) on the parameters n, . . . , 1 is locally analytic,

possibly with branch points but without cuts.

(ii) for x, y  di the expectation value hx wa(1)wb(2) y i has a simple pole at
12 = ih with residue (2)hx cabd(2  ih) y i; similarly hx c abwa(1)wb(2) y i
has a simple pole at 12 = ih with residue (2ih)hxd(22ih)y i. in particular
this denes the   product in (r).

from now on we assume all functionals (2.18) to be analytic in this sense. the relations
(r) then imply the n  n2 recursive relations (ii) given below for the functions (2.23).
they link the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the eigenvalue problem (2.26), (2.34) in
n and in n2 variables.
in summary we arrive at the following system of functional equations:

(i)

a fb() =  (0|)fa() ,

t (0|)b
fa() = r c

d

ak+1ak (k+1,k)fan...dc...a1(n, . . . , k, k+1, . . . , 1) ,

where n is xed, k = 1, . . . , n1, and t is the transfer matrix (2.25). the solutions of
the functional equations (i) for n and n2 are linked by
(ii)

res k+1=k+ih fa() = (k)  (k  ih|pk) cak+1ak fpka(pk) ,
res k+1=kih c ak+1ak fa() = (k  ih)  (k  2ih|pk) fpka(pk) ,

 (0|)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k+1=kih

=  (0|pk) .

18

(a)

here k = 1, . . . , n 1, and we adopted the notation pk = (n, . . . , k+2, k1, . . . , 1),
pka = (an, . . . , ak+2, ak1, . . . , a1). equation (iic) arises as consistency condition for
(iia,b) whenever their right hand sides are non-vanishing, using the properties

cbk+1bk t (0|)b

c ak+1ak t (0|)b

a(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k+1=k+ih
a(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k+1=kih
qk()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k+1=k+ih

pka ,

(2.59)

=  (k  ih|pk) ,
=  (k  2ih|pk) .

(2.60)

(2.61)

of the transfer matrix. observe that specializing here 0 to k  ih yields relations recip-
rocal to (2.40). similarly on the level of the eigenvalues (iic) for 0 = k  ih gives

the restrictions of  (0|) to 0 = kih and to k+1 = kih commute. for completeness
let us also note the recursive equation implied by (2.54)

res k+1=kihfa() = 

1
2

(k  ih) cbk+1bk qk+1()b

a(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k+1=kih

fpkb(pk) .

(2.62)

clearly, viewed as a projection, n  n  2, the recursive operation dened through (ii)
must have a large kernel. simply counting the dimensions one expects 2n eigenvectors on
the left hand side of (ii) to be mapped onto only 2n2 on the right hand side. conversely
given a solution of (i) in n2 variables it is non-trivial that the equations (ii) can be
integrated to a function of n variables within the class of solutions of (i). the explanation
why this is possible stems from the underlying algebraic framework.
recall the notation d for the algebra di = w y (r, 0,) supplemented by the relations
(r). as in section 2.2 we can consider t-invariant functionals, now over the algebra d,
i.e.

i : d  ic , x  hxi ,

h
ht (0)b

a xi = b

a hxi ,

hx t +(0)b

ai = +b

a hxi ,

(2.63)

keeping all other notations. again, such a functional will be completely determined by
its values on strings of w -generators. by construction, it gives rise to a solution of the
system of functional equations (i), (ii) with the identication fa() := hwa()i,  and
vice versa. symbolically we arrive at a one-to-one correspondence:

3. semi-classical limit and phase space of the ernst system

here we study the semi-classical limit of the regular part of the dynamical algebra and
show that essentially the same poisson algebra describes the classical phase space of the
ernst system. in particular this lends a physical interpretation to the variables t ()b
a
and wa().

3.1 semi-classical limit of the dynamical algebra

we begin with the classical limit of the algebra di and assume that semi-classically the
operator products in di behave like a moyal product, i.e.

xy = x cly cl 

ih
2 {x cl, y cl} + o(h2) ,

where x cl, y cl are the corresponding functions on phase space. usually we shall drop
the superscript cl when no confusion is possible. upon expansion in h the exchange
relations (t1), (tw), (ww) then provide the symplectic structure of a classical poisson
algebra:

[wa()] = wa() .

(3.3)

the classical analogue of the matrix dab() from (2.3) is given by

dab() = ccdt ()c

at +()d

with [dab()] = dba() .

(3.4)

20

separating the symmetric hermitian and the anti-symmetric part for  = 1 yields

dab() =: imab()

cab d() , d() = c abdab() ,

detmab() +

d()2 = 1 =  det dab() .

(3.5)

since for  = 1 d() is purely imaginary, one has in particular detm()  1.
we proceed by showing that the antisymmetric part of dab() (and hence also detmab) is
not a dynamical degree of freedom of the poisson algebra (3.1)(3.3). one indication is the
fact that it poisson-commutes with the generators t ()b
a and wa(). more specically,
there exists an automorphism of the poisson algebra such that d() is mapped onto a
prescribed numerical constant, e.g. d()  0 for  = 1, yielding detm() = 1. to nd
the automorphism consider rst the following rotation:

t +()b

a  y++t +()b
a  y+t +()b

t ()b
wa()  wa() ,

a + y+t ()b
a ,
a + yt ()b

(3.6)

which obviously is a homomorphism of the poisson algebra (3.1). note, that the param-
eters y.. may depend on  here. if we further specify them to be of the form

y =

cos 

1 1

2 d() sin(2)

,

y =

sin 

1 1

2 d() sin(2)

,

with  = (), the map (3.6) extends to an automorphism of the full structure (3.1),
(3.2). the condition

+() =  () ,

(3.7)

nally ensures compatibility with hermiticity (3.3). for  = 1 thus + =  =:  must
be real-valued, as is d(). for  = 1 both d() and + =  =: i,   ir are
purely imaginary. under this automorphism the antisymmetric part of the matrix dab()
transforms as

d()  d() :=

d()  d() :=

d()  2 sin(2)

2 d() sin(2)
d()  2i sinh(2)
1  i

for

for

 = 1 .

(3.8)

for  = 1 there are two disjoint orbits of d()  ir under the poisson automorphism (3.6),
the interval [2, 2] and its complement. in particular, the xpoints of (3.8) at d = 2
are fake and correspond to a noninvertible map (3.6). for  = 1, on the other hand,
the poisson automorphism (3.6) acts transitively on d()  iir. this means starting
from any non-zero value of d(), this automorphism can be used to dene new generators

21

of the poisson algebra (3.1)(3.3) for which the new d()  d() vanishes. this fact
ensures that one can always work with symmetric sl(2, ir) matrices

mab() := idab()    1

2 arcsinh( 1

2 id()) = mba() .

(3.9)

further one can assume m() to have positive trace. this is because a vanishing trace
would contradict the positive determinant, so that trm() must be either positive or
negative. since t ()b
a, wa()  wa() is a -automorphism of the poisson
algebra (3.1), (3.2), (3.3) one can take trm() > 0. the poisson brackets of m() follow
from the classical limit of (2.4d)

the poisson algebra (3.10) turns out to provide a direct link to the phase space of the
ernst system which will be detailed in section 3.2.
we focused on the regular part di of the dynamical algebra here because the various
operations invoked: taking the semi-classical limit, taking the residue at 12 = ih
in particular
and applying the automorphism (3.6) are mutually non-commuting.
taking the semi-classical limit of the relation (r) would require further specications.
however since we introduced topological concepts only on the level of the matrix elements,
not for the algebra, it is convenient to discuss the semi-classical limit of the recursive
structure directly on the level of the functional equations (i), (ii) and their solutions;
cf. section 4.

3.2 phase space of the classical ernst system

the classical phase space of the ernst system can be described in various ways. a non-
redundant parameterization is in terms of gauge invariant symmetric sl(2, ir) matrices
mab(), which can be viewed as the scattering data from each of which a classical
solution can be reconstructed. these matrices can be shown, starting from the canonical
poisson brackets associated with the action (1.1), to carry the poisson structure (3.10) [45].
hence in this non-redundant parameterization there is a direct correspondence between
the phase space of the ernst system and the subsector (3.9), (3.10) of the poisson manifold
emerging in the classical limit of the dynamical algebra d.
in the quantum algebra we saw in section 2.2 that the antisymmetric part of dab() does
not decouple algebraically. this enforced to work with the bigger algebra generated by
t ()b
a, wa(), and to implement the decoupling in terms of an eigenvalue problem. we
now show that a poisson algebra essentially equivalent to (3.1) also naturally emerges in

22

the ernst system. moreover this lends a physical interpretation to the variables t ()b
a
and wa() in (3.1).

we begin by recalling that the scalar sector of the ernst system is given by an sl(2, ir)
valued matrix v m
a which essentially contains the vierbein components of the compactied
dimensions. the model is invariant under global sl(2, ir) and local so(2) transforma-
tions 3

v m

b (x) hm

with gb

a  sl(2, ir) , hm

n (x)  so(2) .

(3.11)

this invariance has its roots in the four-dimensional theory, sl(2, ir) descending from
linear dieomorphisms in the compactied coordinates, so(2) being a remnant of the
corresponding part of the local lorentz group. the bilinear combination

mab(x) = v m

a (x)v n

b (x) mn ,

(3.12)

is invariant under local so(2) transformations and corresponds to the metric components
in the compactied dimensions. note that the symmetric mn symbol appearing here is
invariant only under the so(2) subgroup of sl(2).

the dynamics of the ernst system is captured by a lax pair [3, 4] whose spectral parameter
 in contrast to the at space integrable systems  depends explicitly on the space time
coordinates, see [6] for a review. for deniteness, we focus of the case of cyclindrical
gravitational waves. in particular the worldsheet then has lorentzian signature and can
be covered by coordinates x = (t, r), t  ir and r > 0. for the description of the linear
system, light-cone coordinates x = t  r are most convenient. it is then given by

(3.13)

here, q and p are the compact and non-compact components of the sl(2, ir)-valued
current v 1v lying in so(2) and its orthogonal complement, respectively. the spectral
parameter  is given by the following explicit function

(x; ) =

1

r(cid:18)t   q(  t)2  r2 (cid:19) ,

(3.14)

of the 2d coordinates x = (t, r) and a constant  which may be understood as the
underlying constant spectral parameter of (3.13).

3we use abstract index notation in this section to indicate the transformation behavior of the objects:
indices a, b, . . . from the beginning of the alphabet refer to covariance under sl(2, ir), whereas indices
k, l, . . . from the middle of the alphabet refer to covariance under local so(2) rotations.

the associated monodromy matrices u(r, r, t| ) are obtained in the usual way as path
ordered exponentials of the lax connection

(3.15)

which are unique functionals of the connection l = 1
2 (l0l1) . the integrand in (3.15)
lives on the twofold covering of the complex -plane where we choose the branch cut
of (3.14) varying on the real -axis while z runs from r to r. the monodromy matrix
u(r, r, t| ) hence is well dened for  / ir. under (3.11) it transforms as

u(r, r, t| )n

m 7 h1(t, r)k

m u(r, r, t| )l

k h(t, r)n
l ,

(3.16)

in particular, it is invariant under the global sl(2, ir) transformations.

assuming regularity of the currents at the spatial boundaries and time-independence at
spatial innity  corresponding to the classical sector of gravitational waves with regular
ernst potential on the symmetry axis  we dene the following objects for real values of
the parameter :

t +()b

a := i lim

0 v0(t)n

a u k

n (0,, t| +i) (v)l

c ckl c cb ,

t ()b

n (0,, t| i) (v)l

c kl c cb ,

a u m

with

(3.17a)

(3.17b)

the t () are conserved and the w () are conserved up to a local gauge transformation

v0(t) := v(0, t) ,

v := v(, t) = v() .

the fact that the last equation is not 2d covariant is due to the explicit appearance of
the time t in the integration boundary of w m
a (). observe however that according to
equation (3.18) the time derivative of w m
a () is continuous in  since q1(t, r = 0) = 0, as
follows from the eld equations derived from (1.1) and regularity of the vielbein v m
a on the
symmetry axis. as indicated we shall usually suppress the time-dependence of w m

the notation. restoring it momentarily wa() ; wa(t, ) one nds for the time evolution

where 2 is the pauli matrix and (t, ) is real for real . note, that in contrast to w (t, ),
the function (t, ) is dened by integrating over a null line in spacetime, and may hence
not be considered as canonical object on a xed time slice. in particular, this makes it
dicult to compute its poisson brackets.

the matrices t () satisfy (3.2) whereas the w () obey

clearly any gauge invariant quantity build from these monodromy matrices will be time
independent. a gauge invariant object of particular interest is the bilinear combination

mab() = i t ()c

a t +()d

b cdc = w m

a ()w n

b () mn .

(3.22)

the second equality follows from the denition (3.17) in the limit t   and shows
that the matrix mab is symmetric in the indices a, b, and has positive trace.
in par-
a dened by (3.17), the combination d() = c abccd t ()c
ticular, for the t ()b
at +()d
b
vanishes automatically. the decomposition of m() into the product of t  corresponds
to the riemann-hilbert decomposition; the matrices t () are holomorphic in the upper
resp. lower half of the complex -plane. it may further be shown that

mab(  ir) = mab(t = , r = 0) ,

(3.23)

i.e. this matrix coincides with the physical scalar elds on the axis r = 0 [5, 45]. from the
viewpoint of the inverse scattering transform, equation (3.23) is a striking result. usually,
the scattering data associated with a given solution live at timelike innity and have no
direct relation to the original eld variables. in contrast, for the ernst system, equation
(3.23) means that the scattering data live on the symmetry axis r = 0 and are directly
related to the original vielbein variables. the second gauss-like decomposition of m into
the bilinear product of w s in (3.22) therefore corresponds to the decomposition of the
metric into a spectral-transformed vielbein. as anticipated by the notation, the matrices
(3.22) can be identied with (3.9) and the decomposition in (3.22) may be viewed as the
classical analogue of (2.54).

the fact that the scattering data have an interpretation in terms of the original eld
variables imposes an interesting causality constraint, which also claries the structure
of the monodromy matrices w m
a (): monodromy matrices of the form (3.17b) (path
ordered integrals over nite space intervals without any specication of conditions on

25

the physical elds at the boundary of the interval) do not arise in the usual at space
integrable systems. the raison detre in the ernst system is the space-time dependence
of the spectral parameter (3.14). the lax connection (3.13) degenerates at certain points
in space-time though the physical currents remain regular. this happens at the spatial
boundaries r = 0,, but also, curiously, at r = |t|,  a point by no means distinguished
in the physical space-time. however this point does have special signicance for the causal
past of the point (, 0) on the symmetry axis. for given t0 and  (with t0 < , say) consider
the intersection of the causal past of (, 0) with the t = t0 surface, i.e. the interval [0, t0].
according to causality in the (t, r) lorentzian space, the vielbein on the symmetry axis
at time t =  should be a functional of the initial data on the interval [0, t0] only, which
due to the range of integration in (3.17b) it indeed is; cf. fig. 1.

the linear transformations (3.25) provide a -automorphism of the poisson algebra even
after (3.21) has been eaten up by xing the -structure (e.g. m
ac = ac) and even
when working with so(2) gauge xed w m
a () matrices. we shall return to the distinction
between (3.21) and (3.25) in section 3.3.

the poisson brackets of the monodromy matrices t  coincide with (3.1a,b), where again
the coordinate dependence of the spectral parameter  plays a crucial role in the com-
putation [45]. evaluating the general formula from [45], one similarly obtains for the

evidently the poisson structure is not closed but contains the transition matrices u(2 | 1),
etc. on the right hand side. nevertheless the jacobi identities can be veried, and (3.26)
denes a consistent poisson structure on the phase space of the ernst system. as remarked
earlier, the combination d() = c abccd t ()c
consistency thus requires that d() also poisson commutes with w m
a () (with respect to
the brackets (3.26)),  which indeed can be veried to be the case. moreover it can be
shown that (3.26) induces the poisson structure (3.10) for the gauge invariant phase space
functions mab(), i.e. the same as the somewhat simpler poisson structure (3.1) obtained
from the classical limit of our dynamical algebra. thus, up to redundancies, (3.26) can be
regarded as equivalent to (3.1c,d) in the sense that both induce the same structure on the
space of objects invariant under the so(2) gauge transformations in (3.11).4 the extra

b here vanishes automatically.

at +()d

4a similar point of view is e.g. usually adopted to study the symplectic structures on the moduli space

of at connections on riemann surfaces [46].

27

u-terms in (3.26) can be viewed as being a remnant of the gauge dynamics (3.19). the
problem is that (3.26) can not readily be rewritten as a poisson bracket structure on the
initial data w m
a (0, ). this is because although the time evolution (3.19) can be viewed
as a gauge transformation, the transformation is a nonlocal functional of the dynamical
variable q+(x), so that at some point non-equal-time poisson brackets would have to be
evaluated. in principle, however, we view the wa() in (3.1) as being gauge xed or gauge
invariant and time-independent versions of a linear combination of w 1
a (). we
have not been able so far to properly map the poisson brackets (3.26) onto (3.1) for such
a combination. our main argument that it should be possible is, that on gauge invariant
objects like m() both induce the same poisson structure.
one can also check that the counting of degrees of freedom works out: there are two types
of redundancies in (3.26). first (3.26) is invariant under the symmetry transformations
(3.21). in particular the local gauge transformations w m
n (t,|  t|) eec-
tively remove one degree of freedom. in addition (3.26) has a one-dimensional poisson
center generated by the determinant det w m
a (). thus (3.26) contains only two physical
degrees of freedom for the w m

a ()  w n

a () elds, just as (3.1c,d).

a () and w 2

taking the equivalence of (3.26) and (3.1c,d) for granted, the recursive relations (r) can be
viewed as a quantum implementation of the identity (3.22) and the determinant condition
(3.20). to see this set

w 

a () = w m

(3.27)

where ad : sl(2, ir)  su(1, 1) is the isomorphism (a.11) or (b.2). then the w 
are complex elds transforming as w 
formations with h = cos 11 + sin e. further, they obey

2 (mab()  cab) ,

(3.28)

using the denition (3.22) and the determinant condition (3.20). in the quantum theory
(3.28) will turn into a singular operator product. parallel to (r) one can stipulate

a (  ih)  w 
w 

b () = i

2 dab(  2ih) ,

(3.29)

while all   products of w + with itself and of w  with itself are supposed to vanish.
for simplicity we set  = i here and only noted the counterpart of (r2), i.e. (2.54); the
interplay with the other versions is analogous to (r1)  (r3). the obvious -operation is
w 

a ( + ih). finally, consider the linear combinations

a () = w 

va() = ei()w +

a () + ei()w 

a () ,

(3.30)

with parameter () = (t, ), obeying () = ( + ih). if in addition we take () to
be ih-periodic, the   products (3.29) etc. for w 
a () imply (r) for va() with  = i. if

28

the w  in (3.30) are rescaled by (), obeying () = (  ih), the same holds with
() = i()( + ih), a form we shall use later. in principle we could have developed
the entire formalism of section 2 for an enlarged quantum algebra with a pair of w 
a ()
generators and exchange relations like those in di for both of them. the advantage of
working with the linear combinations (3.30) is that the recursive relations are simpler
because the same rule applies to each pair of v -generators. we do not expect substantial
diculties in deriving a system of functional equations analogous to (i), (ii) for matrix
elements of mixed strings of w  generators. observe however that according to (3.29) the
recursive structure in any case determines only the propagation of the gauge invariant
parts. for example, matrix elements with only w +s would only be constrained by the
analogue of the functional equations (i).

as remarked before we prefer to analyze the semi-classical limit directly on the level of
the functional equations (i), (ii) and their solutions. observe however that comparing
the formal h  0 limit of (3.29) with (3.28) and (3.5) one can match the expressions by
taking d() = 2i. clearly the poisson algebra (3.26) admits an automorphism analogous
to (3.6). starting from d = 0 one can achieve d = 2i by taking sh2 = 1. the
conjecture that the poisson structures (3.1) and (3.26) are fully equivalent, translates into
one concerning the status of the eld (). as long as it is regarded as an independent
parameter, the linear combination (3.30) will obey poisson brackets of the form (3.1),
modied by the extra u-terms. by allowing () to become dynamical (as in (3.19))
one may hope to render the va() time independent and either gauge xed or gauge
invariant. at the same time the u-terms should disappear, making the correspondence
va() ; wa() precise.
summarizing, in the classical limit the dynamical algebra di gives rise to a phase space
parametrized by symmetric sl(2, ir) matrices m equipped with the poisson structure
(3.10) and the two alternative riemann-hilbert and gauss decompositions into matrices
t  and w , respectively. the resulting poisson algebra (3.1)(3.3) essentially coincides
with that deduced from the fundamental poisson brackets in the classical ernst system;
admittedly yet with some loose ends.

3.3 symmetry breaking

in retrospect we can now also highlight some aspects of our quantum formulation. as
noted in section 2.1, the antisymmetric part of dab() does not decouple algebraically
within di. thus in order to avoid that the quantum theory has an extra dynamical oper-
ator eld d(), one is forced to go to the critical level  = 0, where d() becomes central.
however an automorphism of the form (3.6), (3.8) no longer exists in the quantum theory;
the spectrum of d() on the state space described by the matrix elements (2.23) is a char-
acteristic feature of the system. remarkably the state space exhibits a (spontaneous)
breakdown of the classical sl(2, ir) invariance that is a is a remnant of the original four
dimensional dieomorphism invariance in the killing coordinates: as we have seen before

29

for  = 1 the eigenvalue problem (2.26) is invariant only under the so(2) subgroup,
while the algebra itself and the spectrum of d() still are fully sl(2, ir) invariant. this
suggests that, in contrast to the prevalent assumptions in many approaches to quantum
gravity, dieomorphism invariance is not sacrosanct; it might be broken for dynamical
reasons.

in view of the possible implications it seems worthwhile to critically reexamine the line
of argument and to see whether, in the context of the present framework, the conclusion
can be avoided. to address the issue, it is convenient to introduce shorthands for the
dierent sl(2, ir) actions involved. let sl2d be the sl(2, ir) action (3.21) inherited
via (3.11) from the linear dieomorphisms in the killing coordinates. let sl2l be the
sl(2, ir) action (3.25) acting by basis transformations on the lower index. finally denote
by sl2u the sl(2, ir) action w m
a . the latter two
have obvious counterparts in di and its classical limit, the sl2d action then corresponds
to the diagonal action diag(sl2l  sl2u ). on dab() both sl2d and sl2l act as

a ()  w m

a (), t ()b

a  gb

bt ()b

dab()  gc

agd

b dcd() ,

(3.31)

and similarly for mab(). thus if sl2l, and hence (3.31) is broken, also the invariance
under sl2d must be violated. on the other hand, we saw in section 2 that on the matrix
elements (2.23) the sl2l invariance is indeed broken down to its so(2) subgroup.

to conrm this result let us reexamine the underlying assumptions. technically, the
result only hinges on the fact that for  = 1 the hermiticity conditions (2.20) do not
permit a solution yielding   11. one can also convince oneself that simple modications
(restoring a -dependence in , use of a graded hermiticity requirement, etc.) either
do not aect the above feature or are at odds with the classical limit.
in particular,
allowing  to become complex (and hence to have a nonvanishing trace by (2.21)) does
not help. the solutions  of (2.30) would then be given by real linear combinations of
 +  = 2  tr11 and 11, and would still generate not more than a so(2) subgroup of
sl(2, ir). ultimately, the reason why the seemingly kinematical hermiticity requirement
can have such a severe impact on the choice of the relevant representations is, that the
algebra d and its -structure already contain most of the dynamical information about
the system.

the close relation to the hermiticity requirement also explains why a group averaging
procedure does not provide a way out. since the eigenvalues in (2.26) are sl(2, ir)
invariant, one might hope that by averaging over the conjugacy class (2.31) the invariance
of t and its eigenvectors can be restored. leaving aside the arbitrariness stemming from
the non-uniqueness of a regularized invariant measure on sl(2, ir), the main problem with
this proposal is that the only sl(2, ir) invariant outcome of the averaging procedure in
t can be a av  11. this however violates the hermiticity condition, and one is lead back
to the discussion of the preceding paragraph.

one might also suspect that the lack of sl(2, ir) invariance in (2.26) is already present
on the level of the (classical or quantum) algebra through the lack of sl(2, ir) invariance

30

a  gb

of the -structure (3.3) or (2.9) with respect to the upper index. since the denition of
d() involves a contraction over an upper index pair, one might argue, that the violation
of sl(2, ir) invariance already enters at this point. however, this is not the case. though
not invariant, the -structure (3.3) is sl(2, ir) covariant. an sl2u rotation of the form
wa()  wa(), t ()b
a provides an automorphism of the algebra d under
which the -structure (2.9) transforms covariantly as in (2.12). but in the hermiticity
equations (2.11) the matrix e drops out; both the operator d() and its hermiticity
condition (2.11) are invariant under both the sl2u and the sl2l actions of the sl(2, ir)
algebra. however its matrix elements (2.23) are not! it is clear that the phenomenon
disappears in the classical limit because then d() can be set to zero. in summary we
conclude that the classical sl2l symmetry, and by (3.31) therefore the sl2d invariance,
being a remnant of the 4d dieomorphisms in the killing coordinates, is spontaneously
broken in the quantum theory.

because of the coupling to gravity, no conict with the coleman-mermin-wagner theorem
[47, 48] arises. in lattice formulations usually also the compactness of the global symmetry
group is assumed in order to ensure the existence of the regularized functional integral.
if, as in colemans version [48], the existence of the quantum eld theory and the noether
current is postulated, the result should hold also for non-compact groups. however the
poincare invariance and the cluster property are essential for the argument. for the
ernst system the former is manifestly absent and the latter would at least require a
re-interpretation. in the statistical mechanics context, one way to look at the mermin-
wagner theorem is as a tug of war between entropy and energy. for a at space sigma-
model in 2d the entropy always wins, forcing the system to remain in a disordered state
even at low temperatures. from this perspective the above result indicates that the
coupling to gravity changes this entropyenergy balance such that a breaking of the
sl(2, ir) symmetry becomes possible.

concerning the worldsheet dieomorphism invariance, it is clear that if 2d conformal
invariance is broken, so is invariance under dieomorphisms. classically the constraints
induced by xing the conformal gauge h = e2 in the action (1.1) are

t = 2b  tr[pp] .

(3.32)

here b =  1

2 ln|+| is a conformal scalar and p is the coset part of the current ap-
pearing in (3.13). their poisson brackets form two commuting copies of the virasoro-witt
algebra. further (3.32) can be checked to generate innitesimal conformal transforma-
tions on gauge invariant objects, otherwise an additional so(2) gauge transformation is
induced.
in particular, for the conserved charges (3.17) and weyl coordinates  = r
one has {t(t, r) , t ()b
a} = 0, and modulo some technical subtleties a similar equation
holds for w m
a (). classically the (weakly) vanishing of the constraints is compatible with
the equation of motion for . the latter can be integrated to express  in terms of  and
p. o-shell the essential dynamical features of  should be captured by the quantum
counterparts of its poisson brackets with t ()b
a (). the latter turn out to be

(3.34)

that is, translations in  are unitarily implemented, and the generator k is the quantum
counterpart of the conformal factor in the 2d metric.

4. exact matrix elements

we return now to the functional equations (i), (ii) of section 2. as outlined, its solutions
are conjectured to describe exact matrix elements in the quantum theory, without the
need for any renormalization. we begin by describing a solution algorithm for (i), (ii).

4.1 solution algorithm

before turning to the solution procedure, let us note some simple structural features of
(i) and (ii). clearly a solution of (i) is determined only up to multiplication by a scalar
function completely symmetric in n, . . . , 1. the recursive equations (ii) cut down this
ambiguity to scalar, symmetric functions solving

p ()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k+1=kih

= p (pk) .

(4.1)

in other words, if (f (n))nn0 (with n even or odd depending on the starting member) is
a sequence solving (i), (ii) and (p (n))nn0 is a sequence solving (4.1), then the sequence
obtained by pointwise multiplication, (p (n)f (n))nn0, again is a solution of (i), (ii). ac-
cording to (iic), the eigenvalues sequences are an example of a sequence (4.1) but there
are many others, e.g. power sums pn
j=1 esj/h, with s odd, or any smooth scalar function
of n + . . . + 1  2(t1 + . . . + t), where t are the bethe roots of appendix b. usually one
will be interested in solutions of (i), (ii) which are minimal in the sense that one cannot
naturally split o a solution of (4.1). apart from these obvious ambiguities we expect
that associated with each starting member f (n0) there is basically only a single sequence
solving (i), (ii).

32

to actually nd solutions of (i), (ii) we make an ansatz of the form

(kl)
kl  ih
where c(n)() absorbs the () dependence and () satises

fa() = f a() c(n)()yk>l

,

() = r()() ,
()(  ih) = 1 .

(4.2)

(4.3)

the rationale for (4.3) is that the rst relation eectively replaces (ib) by exchange
relations with a rational r-matrix, the second one turns out to achieve the same for the
recursive relations (iia,b). the solution of (4.3) analytic in the strip h/2 < im  < h/2
is given by

() = tanh

the functional equations (4.3) are readily vered by means of the integral representation

r() =  exp(iz

(4.5)

in addition () has the following properties: it has a simple pole at  = ih with residue
h0, where 0 := i(ih) = lim0 /(h/)  1.54678. the only real zero is at  = 0.
further it obeys () = () and ()  i for   , cf. fig. 2.
it remains to specify the prefactors c(n)() in (4.2), supposed to absorb the () depen-
dence and overall constants. for deniteness we assume () to be of the form

() = i ()( + ih) ,

(4.6)

where () satises () = ( + ih). the overall i in (4.6) takes care of the  = 1
hermiticity property. comparing with (2.53) one sees that (4.6) amounts to xing the
normalization of the t  (i.e. ()  1) while still allowing for automorphisms (2.15)
with a nontrivial (). the restriction to () = 1 is not indispensible; however since
their h  0 limits can only be 1 anyhow, not much generality is lost. conversely any
prescribed () enjoying suitable analyticity and fall-o properties can be written in the
factorized form (4.6). with () of the form (4.6) we then take

c(n)() = c(n0) (n) . . . (n0+1) 1

finally we enter with the ansatz (4.2) into the functional equations (i) and (ii). the
equations (i) translate into

(4.9)

the redenition of t renders the components of t (0|) polynomial in the j0ih. the
associated eigenvalues  (0|) turn out to be rational functions of j, 0 and the bethe
roots, cf. (b.18). the solutions f in n and n2 variables are now linked by

f a()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k+1=k+ih
c ak+1akf a()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k+1=kih

(4.10c)

34

where again (4.10c) applies only when the right hand sides of (4.10a,b) are nonvanishing.
clearly any one of the eqs (4.10c) implies the other, we noted them both for symmetry.
the system of eqs (4.8), (4.10) for f is now quasirational in the sense that all ingredients
are rational functions in j, 0 and the bethe roots, while the bethe roots themselves are
algebraic functions of the j.

the proper hermiticity requirements are

[f a()] = f at (t + ih) ,

[f e;n...1()] = f e;1...n(t + ih) .

(4.11)

the rst one is just the general hermiticity requirement expressed in terms of f . the
second one is the transcription into the charged basis introduced in appendix b1. in
brief one can switch to a basis in v n on which the matrices  and  in (2.31), (2.32) are
diagonalized. the components of f (n) in the new basis are denoted by fe;n...1(), where
j  {1} and e = n + . . .+ 1. under a u(1)  so(2) rotation (2.32) they transform as
fe()  eiefe(), i.e. with charge e. it is easy to see that the functional equations (i), (ii),
or (4.8), (4.10), then split up into decoupled sectors of xed charge e  {n, n2, . . . ,n},
making the charged basis particularly useful for their analysis. in group theoretical terms
the basis transformation is related to the isomorphism sl(2, ir)  su(1, 1).
let us now address the problem of solving the functional equations (4.8), (4.10), in the
charged basis. as indicated eq. (4.8a) can be solved by means of the bethe ansatz; some
details are provided in appendix b. in upshot an eigenvector we;n...1() is constructed
by introducing a set of auxiliary variables t1, . . . , t,  = (n e)/2, such that a candidate
eigenvector we;n...1(t|) = we;n...1(t1, . . . , t|n, . . . , 1) turns into a proper eigenvector,
provided the parameters are turned into judiciously chosen functions of the js, i.e.

we;n...1() = we;n...1(t()|) ,

t(): solution of bae (b.19) .

(4.12)

here bae are the bethe ansatz equations whose solutions are (complicated) algebraic
functions t(),  = 1, . . . , , completely symmetric in the js. the candidate eigenvec-
tor can be chosen to be polynomial in the j and the auxiliary parameters t. a bethe
eigenvector we() solving (4.8a) will not necessarily obey (4.8b). by (b.31) we know
however that

we;n...1() ,

(4.13)

f e;n...1() = e() yk>l

i

kl + ih

solves both (4.8a) and (4.8b). here e() is a completely symmetric function in j not
constrained by (4.8a,b) in any way.

in general a solution of (4.8a,b) will not satisfy (4.10). the generic expression (4.13) how-
ever contains two pieces of information left unspecied so far. first the choice of a specic
bethe eigenvector and second the choice of a specic symmetric function e(). the ob-
vious way to proceed is to try adjusting these two ingredients such that also the recursive

35

ically expects (cid:16) n

equations (4.10) are satised. as explained in appendix b the choice of the proper bethe
eigenvector amounts to a choice of the proper bethe root. for the charge e sector one typ-

(cid:17) independent eigenvectors with distinct eigenvalues (though there may

be some degeneracies). we expect that typically one and only one of them in addition
satises the recursive equations (4.10a,b) in which case the associated eigenvalue satises
(4.10c). moreover the sequential eigenvector and eigenvalue can already be identied on
the level of the bethe roots. we call a solution of the bae (b.19) in n variables j a
sequential -tuple of bethe roots, if it is real for real j and satises

t()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k+1=k+ih
t()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k+1=kih

= t(pk) ,

= k 

ih
2

,

 = 1, . . . ,   1 ,

k = 1, . . . , n1 ,

(4.14)

where on the right hand side of the rst equation a sequential (1)-tuple in n2 variables
occurs. observe that the combination e = n2 is invariant under n 7 n2,  7 1;
as indicated it can be identied with the conserved u(1)  so(2) charge carried by
f (n)
. in other words the sequential solutions to the bae can naturally be arranged into
e
sequences of xed charge e where consecutive members are linked by (4.14). in appendix b
we show that such sequential bethe roots exist and that the eigenvalues  (0|) associated
with a sequence satisfy the recursive equations (iic). upon restriction to k+1 = k  ih
the corresponding eigenvectors should then always become proportional to the right hand
side of (4.10a,b).

having xed the bethe eigenvector in (4.13) to be one associated with a sequential bethe
root, the only freedom left resides in the symmetric function e(). the aim now is to
adjust it such that eqs (4.10a,b) hold identically. since in the n  n2 recursion step
the bethe roots t,  < , enter via  (0|pk), it is natural to require that e() is a
rational function in n, . . . , 1 and t1, . . . , t1, invariant under shifts j  j + const.
schematically,

e() = e() :

symmetric, shift invariant,
rational in n, . . . , 1 and t1, . . . , t1.

(4.15)

we have veried these features for n  4 by explicit computation and are condent that
they are generic.

in summary we arrive at the following solution procedure for the recursive functional
equations (i), (ii) or their quasirational form (4.8), (4.10):

(a) for given n and given so(2) charge e = n2, n4, . . . ,n+2 compute the trial
2(n  e) bethe parameters and has

eigenvector we(t|) via (b.17). it contains  = 1
(cid:16) n
(cid:17) independent components.

36

(b) verify that for any bethe root satisfying (4.14) the restrictions of f e() in (4.13) to
k+1 = k  ih are proportional to the right hand sides of (4.10a,b). multiply by a
scalar function e() of the type (4.15) such that (4.10a,b) holds.

(c) when feasible compute the sequential -tuple of bethe roots explicitly. repeat the

procedure for n 7 n+2.

the explicit form of the sequential bethe roots will usually be available only for small n;
its existence is ensured by the results in appendix b. together (a)  (c) produces a solution
to the quasirational system (4.8), (4.10). inserting into (4.2) then yields a solution of the
original system of functional equations (i), (ii). for claritys sake let us emphasize that we
have not proven step (b) to work always. however we veried it on suciently non-trivial
examples to conjecture with some condence that it does. a plausibility argument of
course stems from the very algebraic construction used to derive (i), (ii). a t-invariant
functional is an n-independent object, once it exists at all it will automatically produce
a non-terminating sequence of functions f (n) solving (i), (ii). the case e = n is excluded
in (a) because those solutions of (4.8) necessarily vanish upon restriction to k+1 = kih.
however they will naturally serve as a starting member f (n0) to a sequence. the above
procedure then yields semi-innite sequences (f (n))n|e|, which we expect to be basically
uniquely determined by their starting member f (|e|). to illustrate the scheme, we have
collected the rst few members of the charge e = 0,1,2 sequences in appendix c.

4.2 semi-classical limit

let us now consider the classical limit of these solutions. recalling from (4.2), (4.13)

fe;n...1() = c(n)() e() we;n...1() yk>l

i(kl)
kl + h2 ,
2

(4.16)

this amounts to studying the h  0 limit of the various ingredients. for the transcendental
function () in (4.4) one simply has (cf. fig. 1)

() = i + o(h) .

for the scalar prefactor e() the explicit results of appendix c suggest that

e() = cl

e () + o(h) ,

(4.17)

(4.18)

where cl
e () is a ratio of homogeneous polynomials in n, . . . , 1. however provided e()
depends on the bethe roots (which will generically be the case) the corresponding factor
will no longer be symmetric in n, . . . , 1. this feature is related to the curious behavior

37

of the bethe roots in the h  0 limit discussed in appendix b4. recall for real n, . . . , 1
the sequential bethe roots are real-valued and completely symmetric in all variables. for
h  0 however one has

t() = j() + o(h2) ,  = 1, . . . ,  ,

(4.19)

where the index j()  {1, . . . , n} of the preferred variable j() is determined by the choice
of branch in the bethe root and the relative size of the  variables. further j() 6= j()
for  6= . the bethe vector (b.17) contains an explicit power of h = h(ne)/2 (since the
matrix operator b(t|) is o(h)). taking out this explicit power we dene

wcl

e;n...1() = lim
h0

h we;n...1() .

(4.20)

as shown in appendix b4, wcl

e;n...1() has only one non-vanishing component

wcl

e;n...1() = 0 unless

(n, . . . , 1) = (n, . . . , 1) ,

(4.21)

where (n, . . . , 1)  {}n is a particular sign conguration of charge e. the sign pattern
(n, . . . , 1) of the non-vanishing component is determined by the asymptotics (4.19) of
the bethe roots t1, . . . , t as follows: let i = {j(1), . . . , j()}  {1, . . . , n} be the subset
of indices appearing on the right hand side of (4.19). then

j =( 1 if
1 if

j / i
j  i .

(4.22)

viewed as a scalar function of the s the component we;n,...,1() is a homogeneous poly-
nomial of degree (n1), however again no longer a symmetric one.
combining (4.16)  (4.22) we conclude that for n > n0 the leading term f cl
h-expansion of fe;n...1() is given by

e;n...1() in the

f cl
e;n...1() = d(n)

where

e;n...1() + o(h+1) ,

where  = (n  e)/2 as before and

d(n)
e () = ()n(n1)/2c(n)()cl .

(4.23)

(4.24)

here we assumed that () in (4.6) has a regular h  0 limit cl() in terms of which the
limit c(n)()cl = limh0 c(n)() is dened. as remarked before a xed relative size of the

38

variables n, . . . , 1 is implicit in (4.23), say n > . . . > 1. the results for other orderings
then are compatible with the classical limit of the exchange relations in (i), i.e.

f cl
e;n...1(n, . . . , 1) = f cl

e;n...kk+1...1(n, . . . , k, k+1, . . . , 1) .

(4.25)

in particular f cl
e;n...1() is separately symmetric in all j with j = 1 and all j with
j = 1. as described before they are also eigenvectors of the semi-classical transfer
matrix (b.39) with eigenvalues (b.40).

it is then natural to ask whether the f cl also obey a classical counterpart of the recursive
relations (ii). this is not automatic since one cannot a-priori expect the operation of
taking the residue at k+1 = k  ih to commute with the limit h  0. examples where
they dont commute are the function (k+1,k), the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix, or
the bethe roots. nevertheless for the nal solutions it turns out that both operations do
commute,  up to a numerical factor z:

lim

h0hhres k+1=k+ihfe;n...1()i = z res k+1=kf cl

e;n...1() ,

(4.26)

and similarly for the appropriate residue at k+1 = k  ih. the derivation of (4.26) is
deferred to appendix b. in principle the proportionality constant could depend on the
solution considered. the explicit checks of (4.26) on the n  4 solutions however suggest
that it is universal and given by: z = ()n0/2, 0  1.54678. using (4.26) in (iia,b)
one nds that both reduce to a single recurrent relation for f cl
kj(cid:19) .(4.27)

e;n...k+2k1...1(pk)(cid:18) xj6=k+1,k

e;n...1() = cl(k) ck+1kf cl

z res k+1=k f cl

j

the last factor on the right hand side equals the leading term, restricted to k+1 = k
and k+1 + k = 0, in the h expansion (b.40) of the transfer matrix eigenvalues. this
is the consistency condition on (4.27) analogous to (iic). ((iic) itself cannot naively be
expanded in powers of h, due to the non-commutativity of the two operations mentioned
earlier.)

in summary, the solutions of the functional equations (i), (ii) admit a consistent semi-
classical expansion. the leading term (4.23) of this expansion has, for a given ordering of
n, . . . , 1, only one non-vanishing component; dierent orderings being related by (4.25).
further these leading terms are themselves linked by the recurrence relation (4.27). of
course it is tempting to ask whether the leading terms have a direct interpretation in
the classical theory. this is beyond the scope of the present paper; however the vertex
operator formalism of [49, 50] should be the appropriate framework to address the issue.

39

5. conclusions

motivated by the fact that none of the conventional eld theoretical techniques presents
itself to develop a quantum theory for the ernst system, we proposed to bootstrap the
quantum theory from structures linked to its classical integrability. starting from a few
reasonable assumptions on the nature of the quantum counterparts of these integrable
structures, a very rigid computational framework emerged. the eventual outcome are
meromorphic functions f (n)(), conjectured to describe exact matrix elements in the quan-
tum theory, without the need for any renormalization.

on a technical level, our main result is the system of functional equations (i), (ii) for
the functions f (n)(). one of the equations is a standard eigenvalue problem for the
transfer matrix, which is why the functions f (n)() can be viewed as bethe eigenvectors,
however very special ones. the special feature is that they are members of semi-innite
sequences in a similar way the form factors of an integrable qft are; consecutive members
being linked by recursive relations. the solution procedure of the functional equations
for ordinary form factors [28] ( = 2) and for replica deformed ones [30] ( generic) can
be viewed as selecting those special solutions of the deformed kze enjoying such extra
recursive relations. employing the integral representation for the latter [40, 41, 42], the
integrands can be seen to obey recursive relations similar to our  = 0 ones [51]. this
might indicate that the  = 0 system of functional equations found here can serve as a
master system, from whose solutions the solutions of the  6= 0 systems can be obtained
by a universal integral transformation.

physically, the most interesting nding is the spontaneous breakdown of the sl(2, ir)
symmetry that is a remnant of the 4d dieomorphism invariance in the compactied
dimensions. the matrix elements f (n)() and hence the state space generated by the
physical operators supposed to underly them are covariant only under the so(2) subgroup,
despite the fact that the algebraic framework is fully sl(2, ir) covariant. clearly in a
next step one should try to gain a better understanding of the eld theoretical meaning
of the matrix elements f (n)() and how physically interesting quantities can be computed
in terms of them. to this end it would be important to develop, at least to some extent,
a more conventional eld theoretical formulation. a combination of perturbative and
semi-classical techniques should be adequate for this purpose.

non-perturbatively one might aim at developing a dynamical triangulations approach,
using the exact results proposed here, or quantities computed thereof, as a guideline. in
particular, it would be important to understand the statistical mechanics origin of the
dynamical breaking of the sl(2, ir) symmetry, e.g. as a tug of war between energy and
entropy as in conventional spin models. the mechanism may well contain clues for the
breaking of dieomorphism invariance beyond the symmetry reduced theory.

appendix a: action principles for coset sigma models

as outlined in the introduction the 2d matter sector of the ernst system is a nonlinear
sigma-model whose target space is a (noncompact) homogeneous space. such sigma-
models are known as coset sigma models, they are classically integrable and several action
principles and parameterizations turn out to be useful. although in the bulk of the paper
no direct use of these actions is made, both the parameterizations employed and the origin
of the (gauge) symmetries is best understood in the terms of these action principles. for
simplicity we omit the coupling to 2d gravity here, each of the coset sigma-models can
be coupled to gravity as in (1.1).

coset sigma models describe the dynamics of generalized harmonic maps from a 2-dim.
spacetime  to a homogeneous space of the form g/h, where g is a (simple) matrix lie
group and h a maximal subgroup of g. for the purposes of this appendix, we take  to
be 2-dim. minkowski space with signature (+,). there are two useful action principles
for these coset sigma models. a gauge theoretical one

s[v, q] =

1

2z d2x tr[dv v 1 dvv 1] ,

(a.1)

where v is a group-valued eld transforming as v  vh under an h-valued gauge
transformation, and q is the associated connection ensuring that dv = v  vq
transforms covariantly. clearly the gauge symmetry removes dim h degrees of freedom
leaving dim g/h physical ones. alternatively, one can choose a non-redundant parame-
terization of the coset space by matrices m  g obeying a suitable quadratic constraint
m0(m) = 11, where 0 is an involutive outer automorphism of g. the subgroup h can
then be characterized as being xed by a related involutive automorphism  of g, given
by  (g) = g1
0 0(g)g0, for some xed g0  g which likewise satises g00(g0) = 11. ex-
plicitly, the matrices m can be constructed as m = vg1
0 0(v 1); they are gauge invariant
and parameterize the coset space as v runs through g. using mm 1 = 2dvv 1, the
action (a.1) becomes

s[m] =

specically we are interested in the case g/h = sl(2, ir)/so(2)  su(1, 1)/u(1).
the theory with a compact target space su(2)/u(1) can be seen to have two useful
reformulations. one as a u(1) gauge theory on the projective space ip ic2 =: icip1, known
as the icip1 model. the second one parameterizes the coset matrices m in (a.2) by
real 3-dim. unit vectors and yields the s2 heisenberg spin-model.
(the latter is also
known as the o(3) nonlinear sigma-model, though o(3)/o(2) would be the proper coset
notation.) the aim in the following is to derive similar reformulations for the noncompact
su(1, 1)/u(1) model.

41

we begin with the counterpart of the ic ip1 formulation and choose an explicit parame-
terization of the su(1, 1) matrix elds. since v  su(1, 1) i g3g = 3 one has

(a.3)

here and below j, j = 1, 2, 3, are the pauli matrices. the automorphism  in the case
at hand is given by  (g) = 3g3, g  su(1, 1), i.e. g0 = i3 and 0 = id in the general
framework outlined before. on the component elds  acts as  (z1) = z1,  (z2) = z2.
the condition h  h  u(1) i  (h) = h then yields the above parameterization of
h. the gauge transformations v  vh simply amount to z1  z1ei, z2  z2ei and
a  a + , where q = ia3. inserting this parameterization of v and q into
the action (a.1) one nds

s[z, a] =z d2x(z + iaz)  (z  iaz) ,
z2! , w  z = w

z = z1

where z = (z

1, z

2) ,

z  z = 1 .

(a.4)

this is a u(1) gauge theory on the lorentzian projective space ip ic1,1, and is a non-
compact analogue of the icip1 model. the su(1, 1)/u(1) coset theory can therefore be
viewed as a matrix version of (a.4).

the second reformulation of the su(1, 1)/u(1) theory starts from the coset action (a.2)
and yields a hyperbolic counterpart of the s2 spin-model. in upshot it simply amounts to
parameterizing the matrices m by elements of the 2-dim. hyperboloid h2, replacing the
sphere s2 in the compact case. following the general construction we rst compute the
gauge invariant matrix

(a.5)

elements y of the lie algebra su(1, 1) are characterized by 3y = y 3. a convenient
basis is  0 = i3,  1 = 1,  2 = 2. for any real triplet n = (n0, n1, n2) the matrixpj nj j
denes an u(1, 1) matrix which squares to the multiple (n0)2 + (n1)2 + (n2)2 of the unit
matrix. the relations

m =xj

nj j  inj = z   jz , j = 0, 1, 2 ,

(where the    is that of (a.4)) then provide an isomorphism

su(1, 1)/u(1)  h2 ,
h2 = {n  ir1,2 | n  n = (n0)2  (n1)2  (n2)2 = 1 , n0 > 0} ,

(a.6)

(a.7)

42

where r1,2 is the ambient lorentzian vector space of signature (+,,). substituting
(a.6) into the coset action (a.2) one obtains

s[n] = 

1

4z d2x n  n , n  n = 1 ,

(a.8)

where the bilinear form    is that of r1,2. an alternative way of arriving at (a.8) would
have been to vary (a.4) with respect to a and substitute the (algebraic) equation of
motion back into the action. we preferred the above route in order to have the link (a.6)
to the coset matrices m at our disposal. the action (a.8) is also convenient to verify that
the energy density of the system is positive denite

h = 

1
2

[0n  0n + 1n  1n] > 0 .

to see (a.9) one dierentiates the constraint and uses schwarz inequality

(n0)2 =

(n0)2 
2xj=1

njnj < (n1)2 + (n2)2 ,  = 0, 1 .

(a.9)

(a.10)

it is essential here that the hyperboloid is timelike, for a spacelike hyperboloid the energy
density would be indenite.

in the above we started with the complex su(1, 1)/u(1) coset space because it is the
description most convenient in the bulk of the paper. the dimensional reduction of the
4d einstein-hilbert action however initially yields a sl(2, ir)/so(2) matter sigma-model
[2]. the relation is given by the isomorphism

(a.11)

for the h2 variables one gets

n0 =

(a2 + b2 + c2 + d2) , n1 = (ac + bd) , n2 =

(a2 + b2  c2  d2) .

(a.12)

the automorphism  for sl(2, ir) is inner and is given by  (g) = (gt )1 = (i2)1g(i2),
i.e. by  (a) = d ,  (b) = c on the above components. it evidently selects the proper
so(2) subgroup which is mapped onto the diagonal su(1, 1) matrices in (a.3). on the
gauge invariant h2 variables  (in either the sl(2, ir) or the su(1, 1) version) acts as

43

 (n0) = n0,  (n1) = n1,  (n2) = n2, which maps h2 onto itself and has only the trivial
xed point n = (1, 0, 0). in the coset space sl(2, ir)/so(2) one can pick representatives
given by upper triangular sl(2, ir) matrices. a conventional parameterization is

v =  1/2 b1/2

1/2 ! , 1/2 > 0 , b  ir .

0

(a.13)

the combination e =  + ib then is the ernst potential used in the general relativity
literature. in this parameterization the hyperbolic spins read

n0 =

2 + b2 + 1

, n1 = 

b


, n2 =

2 + b2  1

.

(a.14)

in particular the einstein-rosen waves have b  0, i.e. n1  0, and are thus described
by a o(1, 1) matter sigma-model. for the gauge invariant m matrix in the sl(2, ir)
description one obtains

m = vi2v 1 = vv t i2 = 

n1

n2  n0

n2 + n0

n1 ! ,

(a.15)

related to the su(1, 1) version (a.5), (a.6) by ad, as it should. contact to the param-
eterization used e.g. in (3.23) is made by lowering one index, mab = im b
in the case of the compact coset space su(2)/u(1) the counterpart of the action (a.4)
yields the classical icip1 model, the counterpart of (a.8) yields the o(3) nonlinear sigma-
model. heuristically one can then think of the n-elds as mesonic bound states of
the quark-doublets z, via nj = zjz. the analogy is correct in the sense that in the
quantum eld theory only the n-eld generates scattering states.

a cbb, etc.

appendix b: diagonalization of t

here we describe the solution of the eigenvalue problem (2.26), (2.34) for case  = 1,
where only the so(2)  sl(2, ir) invariance remains. the remaining abelian symmetry
is nevertheless useful in that it still allows one to decompose the full problem into pieces
of lower dimensionality.

44

b.1 decomposition into charge e sectors

to this end we switch to a basis in v n diagonalizing . with the choice  = (, )
in (2.31) the eigenvalues are i and we simply label the components with respect to the
new basis by the sign of the corresponding eigenvalue, i.e.

wn...1() = an

n . . . a1

1 wan...a1() , j  {} .

(b.1)

for the inverse matrix we use the index staggering (1)
the nonvanishing components of 

 are +

it obeys det  = i and (a
) = a
. clearly, the same transformation also diagonalizes
the matrix () in (2.32), i.e. 
() = 
2 (+ ). the charge conjugation matrix
becomes c =  . for simplicity we shall refer to the basis (b.2) as the charged
basis (regarding the phase ei as associated with a u(1) charge) and to the original
basis as the real basis. we write e for the u(1) charge of wn...1(), i.e. e = n + . . .+ 1
is the number of + minus the number of  in a multi-index.
in group theoretical terms ad yields a two-parameter family of automorphisms sl(2, ir)
 su(1, 1) generalizing (a.11). it suces to verify this on the level of the lie algebras.
let  0 = i3,  1 = 1,  2 = 2 denote the basis of su(1, 1) used before. the matrices
1 j, j = 0, 1, 2, then are readily checked to be real and trace-free, and hence can
serve as a (non-standard) basis of sl(2, ir).

returning to the eigenvalue problem (2.26) it follows from (2.33) that

t (0|)n...1

n...1 = 0 , unless n + . . . + 1 = n + . . . + 1 .

(b.3)

in the charged basis (2.26) therefore decomposes into decoupled sectors of dimension

me(n) = n

! =  n

n! = me(n) ,

 :=

1
2

(ne) .

(b.4)

explicitly we write

t e(0|)we() =  e(0|)we() ,

e = n, n2, . . . ,n+2,n ,

(b.5)

where we() is a column vector of length me(n). for convenience we split o here a scalar
factor

t (0|) =

nyj=1

r(j0  ih)
j0  2ih t (0|) ,

(b.6)

45

which renders the components of t (0|) polynomial in the j0  ih. similarly the kze
eigenvalue problem (2.38) splits up into decoupled sectors with xed charge. the eigenval-
ues qe;k() in the charge e sector are phases and in addition obeyqn
k=1 qn(kn) = ()nie,
which follows from (2.47). again it is convenient to split o a scalar function from the
qk() matrices and write

qk() = iyj6=k

r(jk) qk() ,

t (k  ih|) = hyj6=k

(jk  ih) qk() .

(b.7)

the reduced eigenvalues in the charge e sector dened by

qe;k() we() = qe;k() we() ,

i.e. qe;k() =

1

h yj6=k

1

jk  ih

 e(k  ih|) ,

(b.8)

will then satisfy

qe;k() = ien .

nyk=1

(b.9)

the t eigenvalue problem (b.5) is in fact equivalent to the seemingly weaker qe;k eigen-
value problem (b.8). to see this note that t (0|) is a polynomial in 0 of degree n  1,
due to the tracelessness of . the second relation in (b.7) therefore amounts to n linear
equations for the n matrix-valued coecients of this polynomial. provided all variables
j are distinct these equations turn out to be independent, so that the t (0|) matrix
is uniquely determined by the qk() matrices. by expanding the t eigenvalue problem
into powers of 0 one sees that also the eigenvalues  (0|) must be polynomials of degree
n  1 in 0. by the same token they will be uniquely determined by their values at n
points, i.e. by the eigenvalues qe;k(). explicitly one nds

 e(0|) = h

nxj=1

qe;j()yk6=j

(0k +ih)(kjih)

jk

.

(b.10)

finally let us note a number of useful involution properties linking the spectrum in the
charge e and the charge e sector. since
t (0|)n...1

n...1 = t (0|)n...1
n...1 ,

(b.11)

one infers:

if
if

e(0|)  specte(0|)
qe;k()  spec qe;k()

then
then

e(0|)  specte(0|) ,
qe;k()  spec qe;k() .

(b.12)

46

in particular for charge e = 0 this means all eigenvalues come in pairs diering only by
a sign. for e 6= 0 the sign ip e 7 e amounts to  7 n  so that by (b.4) one
expects, at least for generic rapidities, the eigenvalues to be in 1-1 correspondence. under
complex conjugation one has [wn...1()] = w1...n(t +ih) and a counterpart of the
rst equation in (2.27). combined with (b.11) this implies

if

e(0|)  spec te(0|)

then

e(

0  2ih| + ih)  specte(0|) .

(b.13)

for the corresponding eigenvectors one can choose normalizations such that

[wn...1()] = w1...n(t + ih) ,

(b.14)

which also matches the properties of the bethe ansatz vectors (b.17) below.

b.2 bethe ansatz equations

the aim in the following is to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in (b.5) explicitly.
for small n this can be done by brute force but for generic n it is useful to parameterize
the solutions in terms of the roots of the bethe equations. the literature on the bethe
ansatz is enormous, some guidance can be obtained from the book [52] and e.g. the
following papers [53, 54, 55, 56]. transferred to the present context the construction can
be outlined as follows: denote by

a := (1)+

an(1)+

an1 . . . (1)+

a1 ,

(b.15)

a cyclic vector on which the operator t from (2.25) in the charged basis acts as follows

a

b

a(1)

c t

c

b(0+ih|)b

a b =   iqj(0j +2ih) a

0



iqj(0j +ih) a ! . (b.16)

b

a(0|)b

a denotes the monodromy matrix (2.25) with the same prefactor taken out
here, t
as in (b.6). following the bethe ansatz procedure we generate candidate eigenstates from
 by the repeated action of b(t|) := a
b(t+ ih|). the matrix operators
b(t|) are commuting for dierent values of t and each b(t|) lowers the so(2) charge
of a candidate eigenstate of t by the two units. the candidate eigenstates can be made
proper eigenstates by turning the parameters t into judiciously chosen functions of the
j. in upshot one obtains eigenvectors

a(1)

c t c

with eigenvalues

 e(0|) =

iqj(j02ih)q(0t+ih/2)

q(0t + 3ih/2)



iqj(j0ih)q(0t+5ih/2)

q(0t + 3ih/2)

, (b.18)

where the bethe roots t are solutions of the following bethe ansatz equations (bae)

nyj=1

jtih/2
jt +ih/2

=  y6=

ttih
tt +ih

,

 = 1, . . . ,  .

(b.19)

the only modication of the bae as compared to the standard case  = 1 is the sign on
the r.h.s. which comes from the ratio of the eigenvalues of . these equations ensure that
 e(0|) is indeed a polynomial in 0 of degree n  1, as anticipated in section b1:

 e(0|) = (1)n1h n1

0

(n2)
h(n21)xj

(j  3ih/2) + 2x

+ . . .

=:

n1xp=0

p
0  e;p() ,

(b.20)

(t  3ih/2)i

(b.21)

where the coecients obey  e;p() =  e;p( +3ih). for e = n no bethe roots are required
and (b.17), (b.18) should be interpreted as wn;a() = a and

 n(0|) = iyj

(j0  2ih)  iyj

(j0  ih) ,

(b.22)

from which one computes qn;k = 1, k = 1, . . . , n. since for e = n the eigenvalue problem
(b.5) is one-dimensional it follows from (b.12) that  n(0|) =  n(0|) and qn;k = 1.
in the expressions (b.18) for the eigenvalues coming out of the bethe ansatz however this
is not obvious as now n bethe roots are required, rather than none as in the charge n
sector. more generally the charge e and charge e sector enter asymmetrically in the
bethe ansatz construction, though by (b.12) they are practically identical.

the eigenvalues qe;k() of the asymptotic qkze equations are accordingly given by

qn;k = 1 ,

qe;k() = y

ktih/2
kt+ih/2

,

|e|  n2 .

(b.23)

the explicit form (b.23) allows to directly check many of the properties which we have
derived in the main text. inspection of the bae (b.19) shows that for real j the bethe

48

roots appear in (possibly degenerate) complex conjugate pairs (t , t
). the qe;k() there-
fore indeed are pure phases, consistent with (2.48). assuming the bethe roots to be
completely symmetric functions of the j eq. (b.23) also makes manifest the cyclic prop-
erty (2.46) of the qe;k(). for the product of the eigenvalues qe;k() we obtain with (b.19)
and (b.23):

yk

qe;k() = () y6=

ttih
tt+ih

= ine ,

(b.24)

conrming (b.9) and thus (2.47).

finally the logarithmic derivative of the bae yields

ih

(ktih/2)(kt+ih/2)

which may be used to prove that

2ih k(t  t)
= x6=
(tt)2  (ih)2
+xj

ih kt

(jtih/2)(jt+ih/2)

(b.25)

,

k ln qe;l() = l ln qe;k() ,

(b.26)

as claimed in (2.48) and in accordance with [41, 42].

let us also briey comment on the solutions to the bae. in analogy to the homogeneous
case (all j equal [56]) one expects that only the solutions with t 6= t,  6= , are
relevant. assuming that t  t 6= 0,ih the eqs (b.19) can be rewritten in polynomial
form. specically they constitute a system of  polynomial equations of degree +n1
for the unknowns t  1
n (n + . . . + 1),  = 1, . . . , , whose coecients are symmetric
polynomials in bj = j 1
n(n +. . .+1), j = 1, . . . , n. the point of adding and subtracting
the center of mass term is that the bjs are boost invariant. in particular it follows that

(n + . . . + 1) are boost invariant ,

(b.27)

t 

i.e. are (completely symmetric) functions of the dierences jk only.

it may be instructive to exemplify the construction for the simplest case n = 2:

e = 2 : bethe roots: 

 2(0|2, 1) = h(20 + 10  3ih) ,

q2;2 = q2;1 = 1 ,

e = 0 : bethe roots:

t =

1

2h1 + 2 qh2 + 2
12i ,

 0(0|2, 1) = hqh2 + 2

21 ,

q0;2(2, 1) = is ih + 12
ih  12

= q0;1(1, 2) ,

49

e = 2 : bethe roots:

t1 =

t2 =

1

1

2h1 + 2 +qh2 + 2
12i
2h1 + 2 qh2 + 2
12i
q2;2 = q2;1 = 1 .

 2(0|2, 1) = h(20 + 10  3ih) ,

(b.28)

let us now return to the eigenvectors (b.17). clearly any eigenvector is only determined
up to multiplication by an arbitrary scalar function, or the corresponding linear combi-
nations in the case with degeneracies. the bethe eigenvectors (b.17) will in general not
obey the exchange relations

f e;n...1() = r k k+1

k+1k (k+1,k)f e;n...1(sk) ,

r()++

++ =  + ih
 + ih

, r()+

+ =

, r()+

+ =

 + ih

,

(b.29)

going along with the redened monodromy matrix t 
 (0|). however, it is not dicult
to modify them so that they do. due to the symmetry  e(0|s) =  e(0|), s  sn, a
joint solution of (b.5), (b.29) can be obtained simply by symmetrizing with the r-matrix:
let sn  s  ls() be the representation of the permutation group analogous to (2.35),
(2.36), just with r replaced by r. the identity (2.37) remains valid with l replaced by
l and implies that

f e;n...1() 

1

n! xssn

ls()n...1

n...1 we;n...1(s1) ,

(b.30)

is an eigenvector obeying also (b.29). here  indicates that one is still free to multiply
by a completely symmetric function in j without aecting (b.5), (b.29). observe that
since we(s) = we(t(s)|s) = we(t()|s) the operations: r-symmetrization and in-
serting the bethe roots t = t() commute. it is clearly convenient to rst perform
the symmetrization and then insert the bethe roots. taking once more advantage of the
equivariance properties analogous to (2.37) one nds that the symmetrization just results
in a scalar prefactor. explicitly, for any given bethe eigenvector (b.17) the product

f e;n...1()  yk>l

i

kl + ih

we;n...1() ,

(b.31)

solves both (b.5) and (b.29). it is manifestly polynomial in the bethe roots and rational
in the js.

50

b.3 sequential bethe roots

let us examine the behavior of the bethe ansatz equations and their solutions under
pinching k+1  k  ih of the insertions n, . . . , 1. the relations (ii) imply that the
so(2) charge of the eigenvectors is conserved under k+1  k  ih, i.e.

n  n2 ,

e  e ,   1 .

(b.32)

this suggests that the bethe roots describing these (special) eigenvectors might likewise
be related. indeed the bae (b.19) are consistent with the following n  n2 reduction
of its solutions

t()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k+1=kih
t()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k+1=kih

= k 

ih
2

= t(pk) ,

for  <  ,

(b.33)

since the bethe roots are symmetric in all j it suces to verify (b.33) for the k+1 = k+ih
case. the other then formally follows from applying the 
k + ih reduction to
 = (n, . . . , k+1, k  ih, k1, . . . , 1).
it is easy to verify that with (b.33) the bae
(b.19) for  <  reduce to the bae with n2 insertions for the t(pk). the equation
for  =  is a bit more subtle and requires to specify the limit in which the pinched
conguration is approached. entering with the ansatz

k+1 = 

t() = k +

ih
2

+ /z() + o() ,

for

k+1 = k +ih +  ,

(b.34)

into the  =  bae one obtains for n > 2

y<

ih ! yj6=k,k+1

(b.35)

= (1z) yj6=k,k+1

jkih

.

this can be taken to dene z = z() in (b.34), showing the consistency of the reduction
rule for t() as   0.
of course, not every solution of the bae will satisfy (b.33), in fact the vast majority will
not. the argument shows however that under the same genericity assumptions under
which solutions exist at all, there also exists at each recursion step n  2 7 n at least
one -tuple of bethe roots enjoying the property (b.33). in addition (b.33) is compatible
with the following reality condition

t() = t() ,

 = 1, . . . ,  .

(b.36)

51

here we refer to the observation after (b.23) that the solutions of the bae come in
pairs (t(), t()), where in general t() 6= t(). we call a solution of the bae a
sequential tuple of bethe roots, if all roots are distinct, real in the sense of (b.36), and
satisfy (b.33).5
to justify the terminology let us consider the behavior of the eigenvalues  (0|) under
k+1  k + ih. from (b.33) one nds
 ik0(k0  2ih) y<
 yj6=k,k+1

(j0ih) y<

 e(0|)

k+1k+ih

= k0(k0  2ih)  e(0|pk) ,

(b.37)

and similarly for k+1 = k  ih. hence for any -tuple of bethe roots satisfying (b.33)
the associated eigenvalues satisfy the recursive relation (iic) from section 2.4

e(0|)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k+1=kih

= e(0|pk) .

(b.38)

one can also easily verify (2.61) i.e. the fact that the limits 0  kih and k+1  k+ih
of  (0|) commute.

b.4 semi-classical limit

the semiclassical limit of the transfer matrix t (2.25) follows directly from (2.8):

h or, with a numerical h, in the region im 0k  h, im lk  h, l 6= k, in order to prevent
a mixing of dierent powers of h. the absence of a term of order h0 in (b.39) is due to
the tracelessness (2.22) of  and distinguishes this case from the usual situation  = 1 (see
e.g. [54, 57]). the same fact implies 2

hamiltonians hk form a family of mutually commuting operators. (in fact the hk can
be viewed as the hamiltonians of an abelian so(2) knizhnik-zamolodchikov system).
simultaneous diagonalization of the k yields eigenvectors with only one nonvanishing

component wn...1, (n, . . . , 1)  {}n, in the charged basis, pj j = e. on these eigen-

vectors the hk already act diagonally. thus the rst terms in the semiclassical expansion

this phenomenon can also be understood in terms of the bethe ansatz. examination
of the explicit solutions of the bethe roots for n = 2, 3 indicates that the symmetry in
n, . . . , 1 gets lost in the limit h  0 and that they typically behave like

t() = j() + (ih)2 s() + o(h3) ,

(b.41)

for some j()  {1, . . . , n} with j() 6= j() for  6= . this curious behavior is directly
linked to the seemingly innocent sign ip in the bethe ansatz equations (b.19). indeed,
entering with (b.41) into the bae and matching coecients in powers of h one nds at

(b.42)

generally one can show that the bethe roots admit a power series expansion in h (in the
region im kl  h, k 6= l) whose coecients are uniquely determined by the assignment
  j() in (b.41).
expanding the ba expression for the eigenvalues (b.18) one obtains

in the second line we inserted (b.41) and denoted by i = {j(1), . . . , j()}  {1, . . . , n}
the subset of js appearing on the right hand side of (b.41). comparing now with the
result (b.40) we conclude that j = 1 if j / i and j = 1 if j  i. a similar
computation then yields
(b.44)

qe;k() = k + o(h) ,
which one can also check to be consistent with (b.10).

appendix c: explicit solutions for n  4

here we illustrate the solution procedure for the functional equations (i), (ii) outlined
in section 4 and list the rst few members of the charge e = 0,1,2 sequences. the
eigenvectors will be given in the charged basis (b.1); we denote by f e;n...1(), j  {}
the n-th member of the charge e sequence in this basis. taking advantage of the duality
described in appendix b one can restrict attention to positive charges.

let us begin with the charge e = 1 sector. for n = 1 one will naturally take f1; = f 1;
be prescribed non-zero constants which serve as the starting member of the sequence. for
later convenience we take f 1; = +, and c(1) = 1. to determine the n = 3 member we
follow the procedure (a)  (c) described in section 4. the components of the bethe trial
vector (b.17) are

w1;++() = hu3u2 ,
w1;++() = hu3(u1  ih) ,
w1;++() = h(u2  ih)(u1  ih) ,

(c.1)

where uj = j  t + ih/2 and t is the bethe parameter. the ansatz (4.13) reads

f 1;321() = 1()

i3

(21 + ih)(31 + ih)(32 + ih)

w1;321() ,

(c.2)

for step (b) one rst veries that the consistency conditions

f 1;321()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)3=2+ih;t=2+ih/2  c32f 1;1 ,
c 32f 1;321()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)3=2ih;t=2ih/2  f 1;1 ,

(c.3)

(and a similar pair for k = 1) are obeyed. following (4.15) the symmetric function 1()
searched for to turn (4.10) into identities should be a rational, boost invariant function
of the j. naturally one will select the one with the smallest possible numerator and
denominator degrees. since  (0|1) = h this xes

f 1;321() = 2i

(c.4)

so far only the existence of the sequential bethe root, i.e. its dening properties (4.14)
have been used. for n = 3 one can still nd it explicitly, a presentation valid for   ir3

is

+h(9h2 + 4(1213 + 2321 + 3132))3  16(13 + 23)2(12 + 32)2(21 + 31)2i1/2
where the expression under the square root is positive for all   ir3. further s1/3 is
dened to be the cube root of s that is real for 3 = 1
2 (1 + 2) (and cyclic) and equals
the positive square root of [9h2 + 4(1213 + 2321 + 3132)]. with this choice one has

,

[s1/3] = [9h2 + 4(1213 + 2321 + 3132)] s1/3 ,

for   ir3 ,

(c.6)

and t() is indeed real for   ir3. it is also instructive to study the branch points of
this bethe root. they are located at the zeros of the square root in (c.5) and have no
intersection with the strip |im ij| < h. e.g., as a function of 3 the bethe root has 4
branch points of order 2 such that moving 3 around two of them interchanges the two
non-sequential bethe roots whereas the other two separate the sequential bethe root from
the non-sequential ones. under pinching 2  1 +ih the latter two vanish at complex
innity which is just in agreement with the desired behavior (4.14).

having illustrated the procedure for the charge e = 1 case we now just present the results
for the e = 2 and e = 0 series. for e = 2 we take f ++() = i(21  ih) with c(2) = 1 as
the starting member. the n = 4 member is conveniently expressed in terms of the bethe
trial vectors, which for n = 4, e = 2 read

w2;+++() = hu4u3u2 ,
w2;+++() = hu4u3(u1  ih) ,
w2;+++() = hu4(u2  ih)(u1  ih) ,
w2;+++() = h(u3  ih)(u2  ih)(u1  ih) ,

(c.7)

with uj = j  t + ih/2. the symmetric rational function 2() is conveniently described
in terms of a basis of boost invariant symmetric polynomials

2 = b4b3 + b4b2 + b4b1 + b3b2 + b3b1 + b2b1 ,
3 = b4b3b2 + b4b3b1 + b4b2b1 + b3b2b1 ,
4 = b4b3b2b1 ,

where bj = j  1

4pk k. explicitly it is given by
2() = 163[124 +  2

2  8h22 + 7h4] ,

(c.8)

and satises

2()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)4=3+ih

the nal result is

f 2;4321() = 2() yk>l

i

kl + ih

w2;4321() .

(c.10)

for the e = 0 sequence one has two options, it can start at n0 = 0 or at n0 = 2. of course
already the n = 2 members will be dierent and accordingly two distinct sequences will
emerge. for the n0 = 0 series one naturally takes f = f = h with c(0) = 1 as the starting
member. the next member of the series is then given by

f 0;+() =

f 0;+() =

2i

21 + ih

2i

21 + ih

hu2 ,

h(u1  ih) .

(c.11)

alternatively one can consider an e = 0 series starting at n0 = 2. an appropriate starting
member then is

f 0;+() = i(21  ih) hu2 ,
f 0;+() = i(21  ih) h(u1  ih) ,

(c.12)

and we take c(2) = 1. equivalently this amounts to having 0(2, 1) = 2 for the n0 = 0
series and 0(2, 1) = 2

21 + h2 for the n0 = 2 series.

to describe the n = 4 members of both sequences we again rst note the the bethe trial
vectors. for n = 4, e = 0 there are two bethe parameters t1, t2. we set uj := jt1+ih/2,
vj := j  t2 + ih/2, in terms of which the bethe trial vectors come out to be

w0;++() = h2v4v3u4u3(cid:16)u2v1 + u1v2  ih(u1+v2)  h2(cid:17)
w0;++() = h2v4u4(cid:16)u3u2(v2ih)v1 + (u2ih)(u1ih)(v3ih)v2(cid:17)
w0;++() = h2v4(v1ih)u4(u1ih)(cid:16)u3v2 + u2v3  ih(u2+v3)  h2(cid:17)
w0;++() = h2(v3ih)(v2ih)v1u4u3u2 + h2(v4ih)v3v2(u3ih)(u2ih)(u1ih)

 h4v4u4u3(u1ih)

 h4(v3ih)u4u3(u1ih)  h4v2u4(u2ih)(u1ih)

56

w0;++() = h2(v1ih)(u1ih)(cid:16)(v3ih)v2u4u3 + (v4ih)v3(u3ih)(u2ih)(cid:17)
w0;++() = h2(v2ih)(v1ih)(u2ih)(u1ih)(cid:16)u4v3 + u3v4  ih(u3+v4)  h2(cid:17)

 h4(v1ih)(u1ih)u4(u2ih)

as required they are invariant under uj  vj and enjoy the property (b.14).
the symmetric multiplier functions 0() are now given by the product of a symmetric
polynomial v0() and a factor u0() depending on the rst bethe root. explicitly

n0 = 0 series:

n0 = 2 series:

where

u0() =

(c.15)

with 0() given in (c.13).
the semi-classical limit of these n  4 solutions is readily taken, and one can verify the
general pattern described in section 4.2. specically let us verify the semi-classical residue
equation (4.27), and along the way determine the constant z in (4.26). it is convenient
to work with the reduced functions f . so, in a rst step we note the counterparts of
equations (4.23)  (4.27) in terms of f. one nds

lim

h0(cid:20)hf e;n...1()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k+1=k+ih(cid:21) = z f

and similarly for k+1 = k  ih, the recursive equations (4.10) turn into

matching (4.26) against (c.17) one nds

z = ()n10 z , 0  1.54678 .

it remains to verify (c.18) and to determine z. to this end we rst note

which for the e() involving bethe roots is note quite automatic. it follows however from
the observation that the classical limit of the t (b.41) and the pinching operation (b.33)
commute in the relevant situations: (c.21) is only relevant when the right hand side of
(c.18) is non-vanishing; that is when k+1 6= k, and when a branch of the bethe roots
is selected by having all but k+1 real, say. with these specications one can choose a
labeling of the bethe roots such that j() 6= k, k + 1 for all  < . indeed, since either
k  i or k +1  i, only one of the corresponding s appears on the right hand side of
(b.41), which one can label to be j(). this ensures the asserted commutativity with the
pinching operation (b.33).

a similar argument can then be applied to the remainder f e()/e(). the components
of the bethe vectors are symmetric polynomials in the bethe roots, and after canceling

common terms against theqk>l 1/kl numerator, the operation to be performed on the left

hand side of (c.17) is known to have a regular limit. the result must thus be proportional
to the right hand side. a proportionality constant dierent from 1 can arise as a remnant
of the before-mentioned cancellations. in principle, the constant z could depend on the
solution considered. however the explicit evaluation for the n  4 solutions suggests the
universal value z = 1/2.

to see this, note e.g.

n0 = 0 series .

from here one can readily verify (c.18) with z = 1/2.
