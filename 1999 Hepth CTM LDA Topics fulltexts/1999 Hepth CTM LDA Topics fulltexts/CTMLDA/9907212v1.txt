abstract. the quantum theory of a free particle in two dimensions with non-local bound-

ary conditions on a circle is known to lead to surface and bulk states. such a scheme is

here generalized to the quantized maxwell eld, subject to mixed boundary conditions. if

the robin sector is modied by the addition of a pseudo-dierential boundary operator,

gauge-invariant boundary conditions are obtained at the price of dealing with gauge-eld

and ghost operators which become pseudo-dierential. a good elliptic theory is then

obtained if the kernel occurring in the boundary operator obeys certain summability con-

ditions, and it leads to a peculiar form of the asymptotic expansion of the symbol. the

cases of ghost operator of negative and positive order are studied within this framework.

1. introduction

in the late eighties, non-local boundary conditions for operators of laplace type found

some interesting applications to physical problems, i.e. the behaviour of a free bose gas

and the phenomenon of boseeinstein condensation. more precisely, the work in ref. 1

studied the stationary schrodinger equation for a free particle in polar coordinates on a

circle of radius r:

in eq. (1.2), qr is dened as

qr(r(  ))u(r, )d = 0.

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.3)

where q is integrable and square-integrable on r: q  l1(r)  l2(r). both positive
(e > 0) and negative (e < 0) eigenvalues are admissible. in the former case, two sets of

eigenfunctions are obtained: surface states, which decrease exponentially with increasing

distance from the boundary, and bulk states, corresponding to more extended eigenfunc-

tions. for negative eigenvalues, only surface states are found to occur.

interestingly, (even) for a free schrodinger operator, a non-local boundary condition

such as the one in (1.2) may lead to two sets of solutions which, in other physical problems,

are normally obtained under quite dierent conditions. we have therefore tried to under-

stand whether the above scheme admits an extension to some fundamental eld theory.

the rst non-trivial example is given, in our opinion, by an abelian gauge theory, i.e. the

2

free maxwell eld fab  aab  baa in vacuum, where ab is the electromagnetic po-
tential and  is the levicivita connection of the background geometry. at the classical
level, this may be studied by imposing a supplementary condition of lorenz type:

bab = 0,

(1.4)

so as to obtain the homogeneous wave equation for the electromagnetic potential. in the

quantum theory via path integrals, one performs gaussian averages over gauge functio-

nals,2 hereafter denoted by (a), to avoid summing over gauge-equivalent eld cong-

urations. this is achieved by adding the term [(a)]2

2

to the original maxwell lagrangian,

where  is a gauge parameter.

in particular, in the one-loop semiclassical theory, the

resulting gauge-eld operator p b

a acting on ab is found to have a non-degenerate lead-

ing symbol. this operator is hence elliptic, with a well dened green function, thanks
4 fabf ab.

to the introduction of a term that breaks the gauge invariance properties of 1

moreover, to the gauge functions of the classical theory, for which

f ab  ab + bf

(1.5)

leads to the same eld equations as ab, there correspond two fermionic ghost elds in the

quantum theory (usually referred to as ghost and anti-ghost, although they are actually

independent2), with the associated ghost operator. its classical counterpart is clearly

obtained if one remarks that the supplementary condition (1.4) is preserved under the

action of (1.5) if and only if the gauge function obeys the equation

f = 0. the form

of the equation obeyed by f will depend, of course, on which supplementary condition is

chosen.

if one accepts the view that the potential a is more fundamental than the maxwell

eld f = da (this is suggested by the aharonovbohm eect and by the emphasis on

dierential operators in the path integral), the boundary conditions should also involve

the potential and the ghost in the rst place (rather than using components of ~e and

~b). this formulation, although not compelling, is certainly appropriate if one studies the

gauge-eld operator p b

a , since this acts on ab, and therefore cannot be properly studied

3

without specifying the boundary conditions on ab. a set of gauge-invariant boundary

conditions is obtained upon requiring that the tangential components of a should vanish

at the boundary:

jointly with the gauge-averaging functional, i.e.

[ak]m = 0,

[(a)]m = 0.

(1.6)

(1.7)

one can in fact prove that both eq.

(1.6) and eq.

(1.7) are preserved under gauge

transformations on the potential if the ghost eld obeys homogeneous dirichlet conditions

(see ref. 3 and our appendix):

[]m = 0.

(1.8)

in particular, if (free) maxwell theory is quantized in the lorenz gauge (cf. eq. (1.4)),

equations (1.6) and (1.7) are found to imply a robin boundary condition on the normal

component of the potential, i.e.

(cid:20) a0

n

+ a0trk(cid:21)m

= 0,

(1.9)

where k is the extrinsic-curvature tensor of the boundary.

section 2 studies a non-local modication of eq. (1.9) inspired by eq. (1.2), jointly

with the request of gauge invariance of the whole set of boundary conditions. the resulting

gauge-eld and ghost operators are studied in sec. 3, and the conditions for an elliptic

theory are analyzed in sec. 4. concluding remarks are presented in sec. 5, and relevant

details are given in the appendix.

2. boundary conditions: non-locality and gauge invariance

since we are interested in a generalization of the model described by eqs. (1.1)(1.3) to

maxwell theory expressed in terms of the potential, we are led to modify the robin sector

of the boundary conditions (1.6) and (1.9), by requiring that

(cid:20) a0

n

+ a0trk(cid:21)m

+ rz 



qr(r(  ))a0(r, )d = 0.

(2.1)

4

however, to avoid having a non-local boundary operator which spoils gauge invariance of

the boundary conditions, we should be able to regard eq. (2.1) as a particular case of eq.

(1.7) when the boundary condition (1.6) is imposed. thus, upon choosing the normal to

the boundary in the form n b = (1, 0), we are led to consider a gauge-averaging functional

(hereafter all indices take the values 0 and 1)

where qa is dened by

(a)  bab + n bqb,

qa  narz 



qr(r(  ))n bab(r, )d,

(2.2)

(2.3)

which ensures that (see (2.1))

[n bqb]m = [q0]m = rz 



qr(r(  ))a0(r, )d.

(2.4)

the full set of boundary conditions is now given by (1.6), (2.1) and the dirichlet condition

(1.8) on the ghost.

3. ghost and gauge-field operators

the ghost operator is obtained by taking the dierence between the gauge-averaging func-

tional (a) and the same functional when acting on the gauge-transformed potential
ab  ab + b (see (1.5)). in our problem, by virtue of the choice (2.2), one nds

(a)  (a) = p,

(3.1)

where the action of p, the ghost operator, reads

p =    rz 
 gacac = bb. such a ghost operator is an integro-dierential

qr(r(  ))n cc(r, )d,

(3.2)



having dened

operator by virtue of the occurrence of qb in (2.2).

5

the corresponding gauge-eld operator is also integro-dierential, because it is ob-

tained from the lagrangian

after writing it in the form

4. ellipticity

the compatibility of gauge invariance of the boundary conditions with their non-local

character has been shown to lead to integro-dierential gauge-eld and ghost operators.

before we can regard all this as a viable scheme, some consistency checks are in order. in

particular, we are here interested in preserving the ellipticity of the theory, which is known

to hold when local boundary conditions of mixed nature are imposed.4

for this purpose, we here focus on the ghost operator given in (3.2), because the novel

features arising from the pseudo-dierential framework are already clear at that stage.

this makes it necessary to use the denition of ellipticity for pseudo-dierential operators,

which is rst given on open subsets of rm and then extended to deal with changes of

coordinates, as is shown in secs. 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 of ref. 4. the key steps are as follows.4

(i) a linear partial dierential operator p of order d can be written in the form

p  x||d

a(x)d
x ,

where (i denotes, as usual, the imaginary unit)

|| 

k,

mxk=1
x1(cid:19)1

7

d

x  (i)||(cid:18) 

xm(cid:19)m
...(cid:18) 

,

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

and a is a c function on rm for all . the associated symbol is, by denition,

p(x, )  x||d

a(x),

(4.4)

i.e. it is obtained by replacing the dierential operator d

x by the monomial . the pair
(x, ) may be viewed as dening a point of the cotangent bundle of rm, and the action of
p on the elements of the schwarz space s of smooth complex-valued functions on rm of
rapid decrease is given by

p f (x) z ei(xy)p(x, )f (y)dyd,

(4.5)

where the dy = dy1...dym and d = d1...dm orders of integration cannot be interchanged,

since the integral is not absolutely convergent.

(ii) pseudo-dierential operators are instead a more general class of operators whose symbol

need not be a polynomial but has suitable regularity properties. more precisely, let sd be

the set of all symbols p(x, ) such that4

(1) p is smooth in (x, ), with compact x support.

(2) for all (, ), there exist constants c, for which

 p(x, )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)  c,(1 + ||)d||,
for some real (not necessarily positive) value of d, where || pm

k=1 k (see (4.2)). the
associated pseudo-dierential operator, dened on the schwarz space and taking values in

(4.6)

x d

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)d

the set of smooth functions on rm with compact support:

p : s  cc (rm),

is dened in a way formally analogous to eq. (4.5).

(iii) let now u be an open subset with compact closure in rm, and consider an open
subset u1 whose closure u 1 is properly included into u : u 1  u . if p is a symbol of order

8

d on u , it is said to be elliptic on u1 if there exists an open set u2 which contains u 1 and

positive constants ci so that

|p(x, )|1  c1(1 + ||)d,

for ||  c0 and x  u2,4 where

|| qgab(x)ab =vuut
mxk=1

2
k.

(4.7)

(4.8)

the corresponding operator p is then elliptic.

in our problem, we revert to the use of cartesian coordinates, so that the above denitions

can be immediately applied. hereafter, (x, y) and (x, y) are coordinates of the points x

and x of r2, respectively. qa is the operator dened by a convolution (cf. eq. (2.3))

qaf (x, y)  naz 

z 



q(x  x, y  y)f (x, y)dxdy,

(4.9)

where the unit normal to the circle has components

x

,

.

n1 = nx =

n2 = ny =

px2 + y2
px2 + y2

y

the gauge-averaging functional is taken to be (cf. eq. (2.2))

(a)  bab + n bqb
z 
= bab +z 



q(x  x, y  y)n cac(x, y)dxdy.

(4.10)

(4.11)

(4.12)

hence the action of the ghost operator reads (cf. eq. (3.2))

p =   z 

z 



q(x  x, y  y)n cc(x, y)dxdy.

(4.13)

9

recall now that the boundary conditions (1.6) and (1.7) are gauge-invariant if and only

if the ghost eld obeys homogeneous dirichlet conditions (1.8) on the boundary. we can

therefore use the identity (k is again the extrinsic-curvature tensor of the boundary)

qn cc = c(n cq)  (trk)q  n c(cq),

(4.14)

the divergence theorem (here br (cid:8)x, y : x2 + y2  r2(cid:9)):

zbr c(n cq) =zbr

n cq dc,

(4.15)

and integration by parts, to cast eq. (4.13) in the form

p =   +z 

z 

h((trk) + n cc)qi(x, y)dxdy.

equation (4.16) shows clearly that, on setting

w (x, y)  trk + n cc,

the integral operator on the right-hand side has kernel given by

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

(4.19)

where ex  x  x,ey  y  y. thus, the corresponding symbol can be evaluated from eq.

(2.1.36) in ref. 5:

q

(x, y; x, y)  w (x, y)q(x  x, y  y)
= (trk)q(ex,ey) + nx

ey
p(x, ) =z eiz(x; x  z)dz.

ex

in our case, eqs. (4.18) and (4.19) imply that the symbol of the ghost operator p in eq.
(4.16) is given by

z 



p(x, y; 1, 2) = ||2 +z 
= ||2 +z 

z 



10

ei(z11+z22)(x, y; x  z1, y  z2)dz1dz2

ei(z11+z22)f (x, y, z1, z2)dz1dz2,

(4.20)

where

f (x, y, z1, z2)  (trk)q(z1, z2) + nx

(4.21)

q

ex(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z1,z2

q

ey(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z1,z2! ,

because ex = z1 when x = x  z1, and ey = z2 when y = y  z1. to achieve ellipticity in

the interior of br we now impose the majorization (4.7), re-expressed in the form

|p(x, y; 1, 2)|  ec1(1 + ||)d,

1 . on the other hand, by virtue of (4.20), it is always true

that

for all ||  c0, where ec1  c1
|p(x, y; 1, 2)| (cid:18)||2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z 
z 

to ensure ellipticity in br  br it is therefore sucient to impose that



ei(z11+z22)f (x, y, z1, z2)dz1dz2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:19) .
|f (x, y, z1, z2)|dz1dz2(cid:19) ,

(4.22)

(4.23)

(4.24)

(4.25)

to go from (4.23) to (4.24).

for example, if d < 0, the majorization (4.24) can lead, for ||  c0, to

c2

z

|f (x, y, z1, z2)|dz1dz2,

(4.26)

which is satised if

q(z1, z2)  l1(r2),

(4.27)

11

and also (see (4.21))

in particular, the equality of left- and right-hand side can be considered in (4.26), so

that the resulting order d of the ghost operator p can be evaluated in the form

q

ex(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z1,z2

and

q

(4.30)

where

thus, this particular order of the ghost operator is negative, in agreement with the as-

sumption leading to (4.26), if c1(c2

0  i) ]0, 1[.

moreover, strong ellipticity should also be studied.4,5 for this purpose, following ref.

5, we assume that the symbol of the ghost operator given in eq. (4.20) is polyhomogeneous,

in that it admits an asymptotic expansion of the form

p(x, y; 1, 2) 

xl=0

pdl(x, y; 1, 2),

where each term pdl has the homogeneity property

pdl(x, y; t1, t2) = tdlpdl(x, y; 1, 2),

(4.31)

(4.32)

for t  1 and ||  1. the principal symbol p0 of the ghost operator is then, by denition,

p0(x, y; 1, 2)  pd(x, y; 1, 2).

(4.33)

strong ellipticity (see comments in sec. 5) is formulated in terms of the principal symbol,

because it requires that5

re p0(x, y; 1, 2) =

1

2hp0(x, y; 1, 2) + p0(x, y; 1, 2)i  c(x)||di,

(4.34)

12

where x  br, c(x) > 0 and ||  1.
in other words, given a positive function c, the
product c(x)||di should be always majorized by the real part of the principal symbol of
the ghost operator. indeed, the symbol (4.20) is such that

p(x, y; t1, t2) = t2(cid:16)2

(4.35)

by virtue of (4.31), (4.32) and (4.35) we nd that the kernel q should have an asymptotic

(4.36)

moreover, the term on the right-hand side of (4.36) with l = 0 should be the one occurring

in the condition (4.34) for strong ellipticity. our understanding of the necessary class of

kernels has therefore made progress.

last, if the order of the ghost operator p is positive and even, one can use theorem
1.7.2 in ref. 5 to prove ellipticity with dirichlet boundary conditions as in eq. (1.8).

since we have previously discussed the case of negative order, it is necessary to describe

how such a positive order can be obtained. to begin note that, if f is a c function on
rm with compact support, one can dene a symbol of order d for any d  r by using the
formula4

the associated kernel is then5

p(x, )  f (x)(1 + ||2)

(x, y) = (2)mz ei(xy)p(x, )d.

(4.37)

(4.38)

13

consider now, for simplicity, the case m = 1 and d = 4. such formulae make it then
necessary to evaluate the kernel  by studying the integral (hereafter x  x  y)

j(x) z 



eix(1 + 22 + 4)d,

(4.39)

which is meaningful within the framework of fourier transforms of distributions.6 to get

an explicit representation, we write j(x) in the form

j(x) z 



lim
a0

ea2

eix(1 + 22 + 4)d,

(4.40)

(4.41)

(4.43)

the link with the theory of distributions is now clear if one bears in mind that the following

regular distribution:




e 2 2

converges in the space of all continuous linear functionals to the delta functional as   .
if one sets  = 1a , x = 2 , the integral j1,a converges therefore to  times the delta
functional as a  0. one can treat similarly j2,a and j3,a, and hence prove explicitly the
distributional nature of the kernel  obtained from (4.37)(4.39).

to sum up, positive orders of the ghost operator, which are necessary to prove el-

lipticity with dirichlet boundary conditions, lead to a kernel (x, y; x, y) (see (4.18)) of

14

distributional nature. an explicit representation can be obtained by an m-dimensional
generalization of the integrals (4.41)(4.43). moreover, the kernel q(x  x, y  y) which
contributes to (x, y; x, y) should be such that the asymptotic expansion (4.36) holds.

this makes it possible to pick out the principal symbol which occurs in the strong ellip-

ticity condition (4.36).

5. concluding remarks

in the rst part of our paper we have shown how to choose non-local boundary conditions

for the quantized maxwell eld in a way compatible with the request of complete gauge

invariance of the resulting boundary operator. this scheme has been found to lead to

gauge-eld and ghost operators of integro-dierential nature. in the second part of our

paper we have studied more carefully the ghost operator within the framework of pseudo-

dierential operators on r2. interestingly, such an operator remains elliptic in the interior

of the region considered therein provided that the kernel occurring in the boundary oper-

ator fullls the summability conditions (4.27) and (4.28). moreover, strong ellipticity for

the ghost holds if (4.36) and (4.34) are satised. the above results are, to our knowledge,

completely new in the physical literature, although some non-local aspects in the quanti-

zation of maxwell theory had been studied, for example, in refs. 7 and 8. the ultimate

meaning of strong ellipticity is that it ensures the existence of the asymptotic expansion of

the l2-trace of the heat semigroup associated to the given operator,4 so that the resulting

conformal anomaly is well dened in one-loop quantum theory. from the mathematical

point of view, strong ellipticity is a precise formulation of existence and uniqueness of

smooth solutions with given boundary conditions in an elliptic boundary-value problem.4

as far as physics is concerned, it now appears crucial to understand which novel

features of quantized gauge theories can result from the consideration of pseudo-dierential

boundary-value problems. last, but not least, such investigations might have a non-trivial

impact on the attempts of quantizing the gravitational eld, where the role of a non-local

formulation9,10 is also receiving careful consideration.

15

appendix

since not all readers might be familiar with boundary conditions on the potential and the

ghost eld for maxwell theory, we nd it appropriate to prove why the ghost has to obey

homogeneous dirichlet conditions in our problem.

if tangential components of the potential are set to zero at the boundary as in eq.

(1.6), the preservation of this part of the boundary conditions under gauge transformations

leads to

[k]m = 0.

(a.1)

but tangential derivatives only act on the part of  depending on the local coordinates
on the (m  1)-dimensional boundary, and hence, if eq.
is automatically satised.

in other words, the operations of tangential derivative and

(1.8) is imposed, eq.

(a.1)

restriction to the boundary turn out to commute.

moreover, if p is symmetric and elliptic, the eld  can be expanded in a complete

orthonormal set of c eigenvectors  of p, for which

in other words, one can write

which implies, by virtue of eq. (3.1),

p = .

c,

(a)  (a) =x

c.

thus, if eq. (1.8) holds, which is satised when

[]m = 0  ,

(a.2)

(a.3)

(a.4)

(a.5)

then the vanishing of the gauge-averaging functional at the boundary is a gauge-invariant

boundary condition as well on the remaining part of the potential (we are ruling out

the occurrence of zero-modes, i.e. non-vanishing eigenvectors  belonging to the zero

eigenvalue  = 0). thus, the boundary conditions (1.6) and (1.7) are both gauge invariant

under the same condition on the ghost if eq. (1.8) is satised.
