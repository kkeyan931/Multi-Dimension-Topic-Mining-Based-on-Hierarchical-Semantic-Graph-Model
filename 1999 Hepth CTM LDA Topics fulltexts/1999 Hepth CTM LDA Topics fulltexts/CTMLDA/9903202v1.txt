abstract

a noncommutative associative algebra of n = 2 fuzzy supersphere
is introduced. it turns out to possess a nontrivial automorphism which
relates twisted chiral to twisted anti-chiral superelds and hence makes
possible to construct noncommutative nonlinear -models with ex-
tended supersymmetry.

1 introduction

supersymmetric nonlinear -models with n = 2 supersymmetry in two di-
mensions are important objects in modern mathematical physics. they pos-
sess a very rich structure interesting by itself and nd also applications, for
instance, in superstring theory. it is a well-known fact that the models with
n = 1 supersymmetry can be constructed for an arbitrary geometry of the
target space. however, the n = 2 case requires the target space to be kahler
[1] if we consider the case without torsion.

there exists a very convenient description of the n = 2 -models based
on the n = 2 superspace.
in this paper, we shall show that the n = 2
superspace can be constructed also on the noncommutative sphere. more
precisely, we shall construct a noncommutative n = 2 supersphere. note
that the notation n = 1 or n = 2 refers usually to the poincare-like superal-
gebras in which the anticommutators of the supercharges are the generators
of translations of the underlying bosonic space. we shall see soon, however,
that due to the fact that the two-sphere is conformally at we can keep this
terminology also for spherical worldsheets.

noncommutative geometry [2] is the generalization of the ordinary ge-
ometry in which an algebra of functions which encodes the geometry of an
ordinary space is replaced by certain noncommutative algebra. as an exam-
ple we take a noncommutative (or fuzzy) sphere which is an object intro-
duced by several researchers in the past [3, 4, 5, 6] with various motivations.
berezin himself has quantized the standard round symplectic structure on
the two-sphere and he found that this can be done only for integer values
of the inverse planck constant. for example if h = 1/n, the quantized al-
gebra of observables (=the fuzzy sphere) coincides simply with the algebra
of (n + 1)  (n + 1) matrices. when n   the size of the algebra ap-
proaches innity; in fact, one recovers the standard algebra of functions on
the commutative sphere. eectively, the quantization cuts o the large an-
gular momenta. this fact lead independently several authors [4, 5, 6] to
use the fuzzy sphere as a regularization of elds theories formulated on the
ordinary sphere.

it turns out that this regularization has an important advantage of pre-
serving the standard so(3) invariance of the ordinary sphere. this is a quite
remarkable fact because the regulated theory contains only a nite num-
ber of degrees of freedom and, even more importantly, the regulated sphere

1

continues to be a geometric object so it makes sense to formulate theories
non-perturbatively directly on it.

the list of the virtues of the fuzzy regularization is not exhausted by
the so(3) invariance and the nite number of degrees of freedom. in fact,
one can introduce fuzzy monopole congurations [7, 8] and, perhaps even
more remarkable, to regulate supersymmetric [6] and supersymmetric gauge
theories [10] while manifestly preserving supersymmetry, supergauge sym-
metry and the nite number of degrees of freedom. it is indeed the purpose
of this paper to show that models with extended supersymmetry are also
regularisable by the method.

in section 2, we introduce the extended n = 2 supersphere and its non-
commutative deformation. moreover, we shall identify a nontrivial automor-
phism of the structure which will prove very useful in constructing n = 2
theories. section 3 presents the construction of the commutative and non-
commutative n = 2 supersymmetric nonlinear -models on the sphere.

2 n = 2 fuzzy supersphere

an n = 1 fuzzy supersphere has been constructed in [6] with a goal to
regularize n = 1 supersymmetric nonlinear -models. the reader may nd
an alternative more concise description of the structure in [10]. in the n = 2
case, the construction begins in a similar way than in the n = 1 one but
there is a point of depart in which new (and welcome) structural ingredients
enter. here are the details.

consider the algebra of polynomial functions on the complex c 2,2 super-
plane, i.e. algebra generated by nite sums of monomials in bosonic vari-
ables , ,  = 1, 2 and in fermionic ones a, a,  = 1, 2. the algebra is
equipped with the super-poisson bracket

{f, g} = f  g   f g + (1)f +1[af ag + af ag].

(1)

and with the graded involution [11]
() = , ( ) = , (a1) = a1, (a2) = a2, (a1) = a1, (a2) = a2,
(2)
satisfying the following properties

(ab) = (1)abba,
2

(a) = (1)aa.

(3)

we can now apply the (super)symplectic reduction with respect to a moment
map  + aa  1. the result is a smaller algebra a, that by denition
consists of all functions f with the property

{f, ii + aa  1} = 0.

(4)

moreover, two functions obeying (4) are considered to be equivalent if they
dier just by a product of (  + aa  1) with some other such function.
the smaller algebra a (the reason for using of the subscript  will become
clear soon) will be referred to as the algebra of superfunctions on an n = 2
supersphere1. it will be sometimes more convenient to work with a dierent
parametrization of a, using the following coordinates
b =

b =

(5)

a
2 ,

a
2 .

z =

z =

1
2 ,

1
2 ,

the poisson bracket (1) then becomes

{f, g} = (1 + zz + bb)[(1 + zz)(zf zg  zf zg)

bz((1)f zf b g  b f zg) + b z(b f zg  (1)f zf b g)

+ (1)(f +1)(bb + ))(b f b g + b f b g)].

(6)

a natural berezin integral on a can be written as

i(f ) =

1

(2i)2 z d 1d1d 2d2da1da1da2da2 ( +aa1)f.

it can be rewritten as

i(f ) 

1

2i z dz  dz  db1  db1  db2  db2f.

(7)

(8)

(note i(1) = 0.)

1note that in case we did not consider the fermionic variables a, a, we would obtain,
as the result of the symplectic reduction, the algebra of functions on the standard bosonic
sphere. in case of considering only one pair of fermionic variables a, a we would obtain
the n = 1 supersphere.

3

strictly speaking, the generators z, z, b, b are not elements of the algebra
a. what is true is that a is (nitely) linearly generated by the functions
of the following form

zkzk(b1)l1

(b1)l1

(b2)l2
(1 + zz + bb)m

(b2)l2

,

k + l1 + l2, k + l1 + l2  m,

(9)

where k, k, l, l, m are non-negative integers. it is not dicult to understand
the form (9) of the elements of a. indeed, we rst note that z, z, b, b can
be also interpreted as a local chart coordinates of the n = 2-supersphere
obtained by the stereographic projection from the north pole. if we do the
projection from the south pole, we obtain a complementary chart with local
coordinates w, w, b
w. a transition rule on the overlap of the two charts
reads

w, b

w = 1/z,

w = 1/z,

w = b/z,
b

w = b/z.
b

(10)

it is now a simple matter to check that the functions of the form (9) will
transform into

wmkl1l2

wmkl1l2

w)l1
(1 + ww + b
wb

(b1

w)l1
(b1
w)m

(b2

w)l2

(b2

w)l2

.

(11)

since 0  m  k  l1  l2  m and 0  m  k  l1  l2  m for k + l1 +
l2, k + l1 + l2  m; k, k, l, l, m  0 we see that the elements of a are
form-invariant with respect to the coordinate transformation (10).
the reason to use the coordinates z, z, b, b is simple: they will enable
us to establish a connection between standard n = 2 supersymmetric non-
linear -models dened on the at euclidean space and their counterparts
on the n = 2 supersphere. in fact, we shall see that the at models in the
coordinates z, z, b, b and the spherical models in the same coordinates have
the same eld theoretical action! they dif f er, however, in the sense that
the algebras of the superelds in both cases are dierent. in the at case the
supereld is an element of the algebra of superfunctions on the euclidean
n = 2 superspace while in the spherical case the supereld is an element of
a.
let us now introduce a lie superalgebra t which will turn out to contain
all relevant structure of the n = 2 nonlinear -models on the sphere. it has
, c 
seven even generators r, r3, z, z3, c and eight odd ones c, c 
 .

we denote the corresponding hamiltonians by small characters; they are
given by

r = 21;

r3 =

z3 =

r+ = 12,

1
( 11  22),
2
1
(a1a1  a2a2),
2
c = 11 + 22 + a1a1 + a2a2;

z+ = a1a2,

z = a2a1;

(12)

(13)

(14)

c+ = a21 + 2a1,

c = a22 + 1a1;
c
 = a11  2a2;
 = a12 + 1a2;
c
c
 = a21  2a1.

we should remember that these hamiltonians are actually preimages of the
true hamiltonians in the process of the symplectic reduction. since they
anyway commute with the moment map (c 1) it is possible and technically
preferable to work with them. a reader who wishes to work directly with
expressions in terms of z, z, b, b coordinates can simply use the equations
(12) -(18) and the following relation

1
22 = 1 + zz + b1b1 + b2b2.

one obtains, for example,

c+ =

zb2 + b1

1 + zz + b1b1 + b2b2 ,

c =

zb1  b2

1 + zz + b1b1 + b2b2

(19)

(20)

and so on for all hamiltonians (12) -(18). in particular, the hamiltonian c
becomes simply

c = 1.

(21)

the last equation does not mean, however, that c gets detached from the
superalgebra t . it rather means that t is the central extension of t /c by
c.
the (graded) commutation relations of the superalgebra t are given by
the poisson brackets of the hamiltonians (12)-(18). though this is a correct

5

denition, we prefer to give an explicit list of nonvanishing commutators
because many results of this paper depend directly on them. here they are

(27)
(28)
we note that the commutation relations of t /c coincide with those of the
anomaly free subalgebra of the n = 4 super-virasoro algebra [12].
let us dene an automorphism  of the algebra t which plays a crucial
role in our construction. it is easy to verify that the commutation relations
of t are invariant if

]+ = [c 

 ]+ = c.

, c 

r

 = r, r

3 = r3, z 

+ = z, z 

3 = z3, c  = c.

(29)

the action of the automorphism on the odd generators is given by the no-
tation itself and by the claim that the automorphism is involutive i.e.
it
squares to the identity map.

it is a matter of a simple inspection to see that the associative algebra
a, which denes the n = 2 supersphere, is linearly and multiplicatively
generated by four odd variables c, c
 and three even ones l, l3, dened by2

l3 = r3

(30)

(31)

2although c = 1 in a, it is useful to indicate c in (30) and (31) because these formulae

hold also in the noncommutative case where c 6= 1.

6

note that

l
+ = l,

l
3 = l3

(32)

and that l, l3 are not independent variables as they are subject to the fol-
lowing relation

l2
3 + l+l = 1/4.

(33)

but the relations (32) and (33) characterize the ordinary bosonic sphere!
moreover, the only nonvanishing poisson brackets among the generators
l, l3, c, c

, c turn out to be

{l3, l} = l,
{c, c

} = c.

{l+, l} = 2l3;

(34)

(35)

in other words, ls and cs completely decouple and we see that the algebra
a is a direct product of the algebra b of the functions on the ordinary
sphere and of the grassmann algebra gr4 with four generators c, c
. this
direct product concerns not only the associative multiplication but also the
poisson structure. the immediate conclusion of those facts is that it is very
easy to quantize the n = 2 supersphere. the corresponding noncommutative
algebra an is simply the ordinary bosonic fuzzy sphere [4, 5, 6] tensored with
a cliord algebra cf4 with four generators c, c
. here and in what follows
we shall often use the same symbol for non-deformed generators and for their
deformed counterparts . it should be clear from the context which usage we
have in mind.

we remind that the bosonic fuzzy sphere is a (n+1)(n+1) dimensional
matrix algebra where the integer parameter n plays role of the inverse planck
constant [6, 9, 10]. since the poisson brackets (34) and (35) are to be replaced
by commutators scaled by the inverse planck constant, we get the following
commutation relations for the noncommutative generators l, l3, c, c
 and
c of the n = 2 fuzzy supersphere

[l3, l] = 

1
n

l,

[l+, l] =

2
n

l3;

[c, c

]+ =

1
n

c.

(36)

(37)

moreover, we dene the graded involution  in the noncommutative case by
(32) on l, l3 and by the notation and the second property (3) on c, c
. it

7

is easy to nd the explicit forms of the matrices l, l3, c, c

 and c:

l =

1
n

(l  1),
1
n

c =

l3 =

1
n

(l3  1),

c = (1 +

1
n

)(1  1);

(1  ),

c
 =

1
n

(1  
),

(38)

(39)

where the rst entry of the tensor product corresponds to the bosonic fuzzy
sphere and the second entry to the cliord algebra. l, l3 are generators
of su(2) lie algebra in the representation with spin n/2 and s and s
are standard dirac matrices with respect to the euclidean metric in four
dimensions normalized according to

[, 

]+ = c = 1 + 1/n.

(40)

note that due to the tensor product structure of the n = 2 supersphere, the
normalization of the central term c must be 1 in the limit n   but it is
otherwise a free parameter of the construction. it is the choice c = 1 + 1/n
which makes possible to construct n = 2 supersymmetric -models on the
n = 2 fuzzy supersphere.

let us study the properties of the algebra an.

it turns out that we
shall need a non-commutative analogue of the automorphism . actually, we
dened  as the automorphism of the lie superalgebra t and not yet of a.
on the other hand,  can be directly dened to act on the whole algebra a
as the morphism of the (graded) multiplication. for instance,

(l3c+) = l

3c
+.

(41)

since we know that the poisson bracket (6) is compatible with the associative
multiplication in a, we conclude that  is the authomorphism of the both
associative and poisson structure of a.
we can equally well use another set of generators for describing the alge-
, l
bra a, namely, the set c
l
3 = r3

and they also turn out to full the relations

l
+ = l
,

l
3 = l

and

(l

3)2 + l

+l

 = 1/4.

(44)

(45)

moreover, the only nonvanishing poisson brackets among the generators
l
, l

, c

3, c

 are as follows
3, l
{l

{l

} = 2l
3;

} = l
,
, c
{c

(46)

(47)

the relations (46) and (47) are actually the direct consequences of the fact
that  is the automorphism of the poisson algebra a. nevertheless, we
prefer to state them explicitely in order to stress the equal footing of the two
sets of generators.

of course, we can now construct the noncommutative deformation of the
n = 2 supersphere, by quantizing the set of the new circled generators. thus,
the n = 2 fuzzy supersphere will be again nothing but the tensor product
of the bosonic fuzzy sphere with the cliord algebra cf4. a question arises:
how the uncircled and the circled fuzzy superspheres t together? let us
look for a key for answering this question in the commutative case a, where
the circled variables can be written in terms of the non-circled ones as follows

c

(2l3c

(48)

(49)

(50)

(51)

now we take the formulae (48)-(51) as the def inition of the circled variables
in the non-commutative case where l, l3, c; c
, c are given by (38) and (39).
the operator formulae (48) and (49) are remarkable since they involve
cubic terms in the old uncircled generators. this causes that the usual or-
dering problem leads in this case to an operator rather than a c-number

9

ambiguity. indeed, writing the cubic terms in (48) and (49) requires the x-
ing of a certain ordering; in fact, the commutators (not anticommutators!)
[c
, c] in (48) and (49) do the job. a slight change of the ordering in any of
the denitions (48),(49) would completely destroy a crucial property of this
maps, namely, the circled variables full exactly the same properties as the
noncircled ones. explicitely,

[l

[l

] =

[c

(52)

(53)

and all remaining graded commutators vanish. remind that the relations
(52) and (53) are not postulated but they are derived from the relations (36)
and (37) and the denitions (48) and (49). the normalization and reality of
l
3, l

 is also correct since one can verify that

(l

3)2 + l

+l

 = l2 + l+l = 1/4 + 1/2n

and

l
+ = l
,

l
3 = l
3.

(54)

(55)

thus we conclude that the uncircled n = 2 fuzzy supersphere is the same
thing as the circled one. the mapping  preserve the commutation relations
among the generators therefore it can be extended to the whole supersphere
as the automorphism of its associative product. moreover,  is an involutive
automorphism since (51) and (52) are manifestly involutive and a tedious
computation shows that the denitions (48) - (51) imply

(61)

the construction of the involutive automorphism  is the main result of
this section. in what follows, we shall always enjoy a freedom of choosing
to work in one of the two  related equivalent parametrization of the n = 2
fuzzy supersphere.

3 n = 2 nonlinear -models

3.1 the commutative case

the basic fact of life in the n = 2 at euclidean superspace is that a la-
grangian density of a eld theoretic model does not involve derivatives. all
dynamics is encoded in constraints imposed on n = 2 superelds in a way
compatible with the n = 2 supersymmetry. for example, the lagrangian of
an n = 2 supersymmetric -model on the euclidean plane is given by

s = z dzdzdb1db1db2db2k( ).

(62)

here (z, z, b1, b1, b2, b2) and (z, z, b1, b1, b2, b2) are superelds on the plane.
they are subject to the following constraints

d+ = d = 0; d  = d+  = 0

(63)

and k( ) is the kahler potential of a target kahler manifold with complex
coordinates , . the supersymmetric covariant derivatives are dened as

d+ = b2 + b1z,

d+ = b2 + b1z, d = b1 + b2z,

d = b1 + b2z.
(64)
note that the at measure in the integral (62) coincides with the n = 2
round measure (8). because of this fact, the model (62) can be reinter-
preted as a model on the n = 2 supersphere. for this interpretation, it is
sucient to declare that both  and  are not the superelds on the plane

11

but but they are rather elements of the algebra a i.e. of the algebra of the
superfunctions on the n = 2 supersphere. more precisely, the superelds are
linear combinations of the elements of a of the form (9) with coecients
being ordinary numbers, when l1 +l2 +l1 +l2 is even and grassmann numbers
when l1 + l2 + l1 + l2 is odd. these grassmann numbers anticommute with
the odd generators of a. as a result, the superelds ,  are even. this
remark is important when we calculate the poisson brackets involving the
superelds or when we use the graded involution.

the constraints (63) turn out to be equivalent to
, } = 0,
{c

{c, } = 0,

(65)

where {., .} is the round poisson bracket (6) and the hamiltonians c, c

are given in (15) and (17). the constraints (63) or (65) dene so-called
twisted chiral and twisted anti-chiral elds, respectively.
in order to have
another viable set of poisson bracket constraints, giving so-called chiral and
anti-chiral superelds [1], we would have to change the symplectic structure
(6). this is easy but we shall not discuss it in this paper because the resulting
picture is completely analoguous to the twisted one. we just remark, that
from the point of view of the poisson bracket (6) on the n = 2 supersphere,
the twisted elds are more natural than the untwisted ones.

there is an inconspicuous but, in fact, an important detail that concerns
the (graded) involution in (62) denoted by a bar. it acts on the generators
z, z, b1, b1, b2, b2 following the notation itself . this involution is not the
same as the one denoted by  in section 2 (cf. (2)), although they coincide
on the bosonic variables z, z. in fact,  is rather a world-sheet involution.
it is with respect to  that the generators l, l or l
, l full the correct
reality conditions (32) of the bosonic generators of the (fuzzy) sphere. on
the other hand, the bar involution sets the reality properties of fermionic
elds if the supersymmetric action is written in components. these reality
properties propagate to the quantization of eld theoretical model and dene
an involution on the hilbert space of the quantum eld theory. we remark
that all this is also a standard at space supersymmetric story although many
authors do not provide a detailed discussion of various involutions in game.
their approach is simple and pragmatic, once a lagrangian is worked out in
components, an involution on fermions is set which makes the action real. in
our case, we have to be more careful since an experience [6, 9] teaches us that

12

only superelds as whole are deformable; in other words, the notion of the
component elds may loose sense after the noncommutative deformation.

once we have dened the -model (62) on the commutative n = 2 su-
persphere, it is natural to ask what is its algebra of supersymmetry. there
is a huge formal supersymmetry algebra of the theory (62) known as the
n = 2 super-de-witt algebra (whose central extension is n = 2 virasoro
algebra [12]). it is actually dened as the lie superalgebra of vector elds
that preserve the constraints (63) [13] and, explicitely, it is generated by even
chiral (anti-chiral) vector elds lk, jk, k  z ( lk, jk, k  z) and odd chiral
(anti-chiral) ones g

the barred generators are given by the same formulas with z, b1, b2 replacing
z, b1, b2. it turns out that only eight chiral generators l1, l0, j0, g
and
 1
eight anti-chiral ones l1 l0, g
preserve the algebra a of the superelds
 1
on n = 2 supersphere. obviously, they form a lie subalgebra of the full de
witt algebra. it therefore seems that the algebra of supersymmetry of the
model on the sphere has sixteen complex dimensions. however, it is not so
because we have to impose two further condition which the supersymmetry
algebra has to full:

1) since we are interested in the noncommutative deformation of the n = 2
-model (62) we have to consider only those generators which act by means
of the poisson bracket (6). this means that they are the hamiltonian vector
elds and, in the noncommutative case, they will act via the commutators.
this reduces the supersymmetry algebra to an eight dimensional lie super-
algebra spl(2, 1). it is generated by four even generators r, r3, z3 and four
odd ones c

lie subalgebra of t hence its commutation relations are contained in (22) -
(28).

2) we require that a supersymmetric transformation  realized on both su-
perelds  and  respect the conjugacy of the elds, in other words,

 =  .

(72)

this reduces the supersymmetry algebra of the commutative model (62) to
a certain real form of the spl(2, 1) algebra. explicitely, the spl(2, 1) super-
symmetry transformation is given by
+ + c 

 = (+c

and in the same way for . the grassmann parameters ,  have to full

(74)

(75)

these conditions correspond precisely to the choice of the real form of the
spl(2, 1) superalgebra.

we have to check that the constraints (65) are compatible with the

, z+, c form spl(2, 1) multiplets under the

spl(2, 1) supersymmetry. the most simple way to see it is to note that
1) the quadruples c, z, c and c
adjoint action in t (xy);
2) {c, } and {c, } trivially vanish;
, } = 0 imply {z, } = 0 and
3) the constraints {c, } = 0 and {c
{z+, } = 0, respectively. this is true because of the explicit formulae (61).
we conclude that the model (62) on the commutative sphere is spl(2, 1)
supersymmetric, because also the measure of the integral (8) is invariant with
respect to the hamiltonian vector elds. indeed, one can straightforwardly
check that

for whatever t, f  a.

i({t, f}) = 0

(76)

3.2 the noncommutative case

here are the ingredients needed for dening the noncommutative deformation
of the n = 2 supersymmetric -model (62):

1) the bar involution in the noncommutative case for it coidenties the
supersymmetry algebra and ensures the reality of the lagrangian k( ). it
turns out that in the commutative case the bar involution can be expressed
in terms of the automorphism . explicitely,
l = l
,

l3 = l
3,

c = c.

(77)

c = c
,

 = c
c
 ,

since the automorphism  continues to make sense on the n = 2 fuzzy super-
sphere, we can use the relations (77) as the denition of the barred quantities
in the noncommutative case. note, however, that the barred involution is
not an automorphism of the algebra an although its action on the generators
l, l3, c, c
 of an is expressible in terms of the automorphism . the point
is that the bar involution acting on the product of two generators is not a
morphism of the associative product in an since it is dened by the rst rule
of (3), e.g.

c+c

 = c

c+ = c
+ c
.

the automorphism , in turn, does respect the mutiplication, e.g.

(c+c

) = c

+c
 .

(78)

(79)

we actually use rst rule of (3) to dene the barred involution of all elements
of an hence the second rule of (3) has to be veried. for example, we can
calculate (c
+) by using the formula (48) and the rst rule of (3). but one
can use also (77) and the second rule of (3), i.e.

c
+ = c = c.

(80)

the consistency of the denition requires that both ways of calculating must
be equivalent. fortunately, this is the case and we have the bar involution
also in the noncommutative case.

2) we need also the noncommutative analogue of the integral (8).
it is
a simple exercise to show that the commutative measure in the variables

15

z, z, b, b can be rewritten in the variables l, l3, c, c

 as follows

dzdzdb1db1db2db2 = dl+dldl3(l+l + l2

3 

1
4

)dc+dcdc

+dc
.

(81)

thus we see that the measure is simply the direct product of the round
measure on the bosonic sphere and of the at measure in the remaining
fermionic variables.

upon the berezin quantization, the integral over the bosonic measure
1
becomes
n+1tr [6]. the fermionic measure, in turn, becomes the supertrace
str (not the trace!) over the cliord algebra cf4. indeed, the generators
c, c
 of the cliord algebra satisfy the canonical anticommutation relation
of a quantum mechanical system with two fermionic degrees of freedom. the
cliord algebra can be identied with the algebra of linear operators acting
on the corresponding fock space. the latter is naturally graded so we obtain
the supertrace as

str(.)  tr(.),

(82)

where  is the grading operator. it is a textbook fact that, upon the quanti-
zation of the fermionic system, the berezin integral becomes the supertrace.
it is easy to see it directly in the case of one fermionic oscillator only. then
the only nonzero berezin integral is the one over cc; this is also true for the
supertrace in the quantum case.

the integral (denote it in) in the noncommutative case has a crucial

property

(83)
for any a, b  an. this property plays the same role in the noncommutative
case as (76) in the commutative one. namely it will ensure the supersym-
metry of the following action

in(ab  (1)abba) = 0

sn = in(k( )).

(84)

this is the action of the n = 2 supersymmetric nonlinear -model on the
fuzzy sphere. the superelds  and  are now elements of the fuzzy algebra
an. more precisely, if we take any element of an, it can be written as a
polynomial in the generators l, l3, c, c
. now the coecients in front of odd
polynomials of the superelds have to anticommute with those polynomials,
for example one has

c+l+l = c+l+l.

16

(85)

the coecients in front of the even polynomials commute with them:

rlc+c = lc+cr.

(86)

these rules are, of course, standard in the superworld. in the commutative
case, s in (85) were the grassmann numbers belonging to some grassmann
algebra p . in the noncommutative case, however, they are the grassman
numbers tensored with the grading  of the linear space hn where an acts.
the tensoring with  is the representation of p (due to 2 = 1) and it ensures
the correct commutative limit of the superelds , . on the other hand, r
in (86) can be interpreted as a complex multiple of the unit element of an.
an important thing is that s are odd and rs even. thus the superelds
,  are even.

the constraints in the noncommutative case are dened by the formulae

n[c, ] = 0, n[c

, ] = 0.

(87)

note that the only change with respect to the commutative case is the re-
placement of the poisson brackets by the commutators scaled by the inverse
planck constant n. of course, the hamiltonians c, c
 are elements of an.
the spl(2, 1) supersymmetry transformation  is again generated by the
 given by (12),(13),(16) and

noncommutative hamiltonians r, r3, z3, c
(18). explicitely

, c

 = n(+[c

+, ] + [c

+ , ] + [c
+ [z3, ] + 3[r3, ] + +[r+, ] + [r, ]).

 , ] + +[c

, ]

(88)
here , 3,  are numbers and the parameters  and  are the quantities
of the type  in (85). this is important for ensuring that a commutator of
two supertransformations with dierent coecients is again a supertransfor-
mation. the parameters of  are again to full the same relations (74) and
(75) as their counterparts in the commutative case. with this assigment we
can easily check that we have also in the noncommutative case

 =  .

(89)

one can prove that the constraints (87) are compatible with the super-
symmetry transformation in the same way as in the commutative setting.
summing up, we have constructed the n = 2 spl(2, 1) supersymmetric non-
linear -model on the noncommutative sphere. two n = 1 osp(2, 1) subsu-
persymmetries can be obtained by setting respectively  =  and  = .

17

3.3 solving the constraints

in the at space commutative case, one can do more than just dene the -
model by the action (62) and the constraints (63). indeed, one can eectively
solve (63) and cast the action (62) in terms of the solutions of the constraints.
here we are going to show that all this can be performed also on the com-
mutative n = 2 supersphere and even on the noncommutative one. indeed,
due to the poisson brackets/commutation relations (34),(35)/(36),(37) we
immediately conclude, that any element of a or an of the form

(l, l3, c)

(90)

solves the rst set of the constraints in (87) and any element of the form

(l

, l

3, c
)

(91)

solves the second set. let us moreover show that every solution of (87) is of
the form (90). indeed, it is a simple matter to check that every element 
of a or an can be unambiguosly written as
 = (l, l3, c) + (l, l3, c)c

+c
.
(92)
now the fact that (l, l3, c) is the most general solution of (87) is the
direct consequence of the poisson brackets/commutation relations (34)-(37).
the same argument holds also for the circled variables.

+ + +(l, l3, c)c

 + +(l, l3, c)c

finally, we remark how we can cast in components the action on the
commutative n = 2 supersphere. we use the fact that l, l3  a are
the generators of the ordinary sphere (cf. (32) and (33)). we can therefore
introduce variables u, u such that

l+ =

u

1 + uu

,

l =

u

1 + uu

,

l =

uu  1
uu + 1

.

then

c+ =

ub2 + b1
1 + uu

c = b2 + ub1
1 + uu

.

comparing with (20), we have

u = z + b1b2,

u = z + b2b1

18

(93)

(94)

(95)

and we arrive at

 = (z + b1b2, z + b2b1, b1, b2).

much in the same way, we obtain

 = (z + b2b1, z + b1b2, b1, b2).

(96)

(97)

expanding (96) and (97) in b, b, inserting in the action (62) and integrating
over b, b, we obtain the standard action of the n = 2 supersymmetric -
model in components.

4 outlook

for the purpose of the quantization of the model, say by a path integral, it
is sucient to work directly in the supereld formalism. nevertheless, it is
perhaps of interest to know whether one can introduce the component elds
also in the noncommutative case. in the n = 1 case it turned out [6] that
one could not do that for a simple reason that the n = 1 supersphere is not
the n = 0 supersphere tensored with some algebra. in the n = 2 case the
question is more subtle. one has to nd variables between the circled and
the uncircled ones, like z, z, b, b in the commutative case, such that the
n = 2 supersphere would be the product of the bosonic fuzzy sphere and
the cliord algebra in these intermediate variables. this is needed for being
able to take the supertrace over the cliord algebra separately and cast the
action as the trace over the bosonic fuzzy sphere only. it is an open problem;
personally we feel that it is not possible.

another natural question concerns coordinate transformations on the
kahler target. although for some simple manifolds (like complex projec-
tive spaces) one can completely dene the kahler potential working in one
chart, one should anyway look for a more invariant denition of the theory.
of course, this problem does not concern only the theories on the noncom-
mutative worldsheets but arises in general in the studies of quantum theory
of the nonlinear -models
