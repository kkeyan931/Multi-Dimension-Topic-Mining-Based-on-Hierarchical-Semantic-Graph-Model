abstract

by explicit construction of the adhm data, we prove the existence of a charge
seven instanton with icosahedral symmetry. by computing the holonomy of this
instanton we obtain a skyrme eld which approximates the minimal energy charge
seven skyrmion. we also present a one parameter family of tetrahedrally symmetric
instantons whose holonomy gives a family of skyrme elds which models a skyrmion
scattering process, where seven well-separated skyrmions collide to form the icosa-
hedrally symmetric skyrmion.

1 introduction

skyrmions are a type of topological soliton in three-dimensional space which are
of interest to physicists, in that they are candidates for a solitonic description of nuclei.
numerical simulations reveal that the minimal energy skyrmions often have a great deal
of symmetry, and in particular the charge seven skyrmion has icosahedral symmetry[4].

one approach to the study of skyrmions is the suggestion by atiyah and manton[2]
that low energy skyrmions of charge n may be approximated by computing the holonomy
of a charge n instanton in euclidean ir4 along lines parallel to the euclidean time-axis.
this proposal therefore predicts the existence of a charge seven instanton with icosahedral
symmetry.
in this paper we verify that indeed such an instanton exists by presenting
the corresponding adhm data. we then use this data to compute the holonomy of the
instanton and hence generate a skyrme eld of charge seven with icosahedral symmetry,
which is an approximation to the minimal energy skyrmion.

manton has proposed[16] that the low energy dynamics of n skyrmions may be ap-
proximated by motion on a nite dimensional manifold of charge n skyrme elds, and one
reasonable choice for such a manifold appears to be the moduli space of n-instantons[2].
in such an approximation a scattering of seven skyrmions is described by a one-parameter
family of 7-instantons. we present such a family of instantons, obtained by imposing
tetrahedral symmetry, and compute the associated skyrme elds. we display the baryon
density isosurfaces for this scattering process, in which six skyrmions approach along the
cartesian axes a seventh skyrmion at the origin. the skyrmions merge to form rst a
dodecahedron, then a cube, and nally the dual dodecahedron before again separating
along the cartesian axes leaving a single skyrmion remaining at the origin. part of this
scattering process, where the dodecahedron deforms to its dual, is believed to be an im-
portant vibrational mode of the dodecahedral skyrmion, and these are of relevance when
considering the quantization of skyrmions[3].

2 an icosahedral 7-instanton

in this section we shall present the adhm data for an icosahedrally symmetric 7-
instanton. first, we briey recall the adhm construction of instantons[1] and give an
explanation of symmetry in a gauge theory.

the adhm data for an su(2) n-instanton consists of a matrix

m = (cid:18) l
m (cid:19)

(2.1)

where l is a row of n quaternions and m is a symmetric n  n matrix of quaternions. by
the adhm constraints we shall mean the condition

m m is a real matrix,

(2.2)

where m  denotes the quaternionic conjugate transpose of m.

2

the rst step in constructing the instanton from the adhm data is to form the matrix

(x) = (cid:18)

l

m  x11n(cid:19)

(2.3)

where 11n denotes the n  n identity matrix and x is the quaternion corresponding to a
point in ir4 via x = x4 + ix1 + jx2 + kx3.
the second step is then to nd the (n + 1)-component column vector n(x), of unit

length, which solves the equation

n(x)(x) = 0.

(2.4)

the nal step is to compute the gauge potential a(x) from n(x) using the relation

a(x) = n(x)n(x).

(2.5)

this denes a pure quaternion which can then be regarded as an element of su(2) using
the standard representation of the quaternions in terms of the pauli matrices.

in order that these steps make sense it is necessary that the adhm data satisfy an
additional invertibility condition: that the columns of (x) span an n-dimensional quater-
nionic space, for every x. equivalently this condition can be expressed as:

(x)(x) is invertible for every x.

(2.6)

in the absence of this condition adhm data satisfying (2.2) only gives rise to a self-dual
gauge eld with singularities (corresponding to the points x where (2.6) fails).

2.0.1 symmetric instantons

it will be useful to start by considering the problem of symmetric instantons in a general
context. thus let g  so(3) be a subgroup of the rotation group of euclidean 3-space,
and make it act on ir4 by rotations on (x1, x2, x3), leaving x4 alone. this action has a very
convenient description using quaternions. for this, replace g by the corresponding binary

group eg  su(2) (the double cover of g obtained from the double cover su(2)  so(3)).

now

su(2) = sp(1) = {u  ih : uu = uu = 1}

(2.7)
and x 7 uxu1 clearly preserves the x4 (real) component of x. it also acts on the imaginary
part of x by the rotation in so(3) corresponding to u in su(2). (in fact this gives a
construction of the double cover of so(3) by su(2).) from now on, whenever we speak
of a subgroup of so(3) acting on ir4, we shall mean that it acts in the way we have just
described.

in order to get a grip on the problem of imposing symmetry in a gauge theory, let
us introduce a rank-2 vector bundle e over ir4 and assume that our gauge potential a

denes a connection on e. if eg acts on e then it makes good sense to require a to be
invariant (or symmetric) under this action. in this case an action of eg on e consists of

3

the data of a unitary map (g, x) : ex  egxg1 for each g  eg and x  ir4, depending

smoothly on x, and satisfying (1, x) = the identity, and

(f, gxg1)(g, x) = (f g, x) for all f, g, eg, x  ir4

(2.8)

both sides of this equation being maps ex  e(f g)x(f g)1 .
it is important to note that one cannot assume that there exists a gauge in which
all the s are equal to the identity. what is true, however, is the following. let a be

any xed-point of the action of eg, i.e. any point on the x4-axis. for such a point, (2.8)
reads (f, a)(g, a) = (f g, a) for all f, g, eg, giving a representation of eg on the bre

ea. this representation changes to an equivalent one under changes of gauge, so if this
representation is non-trivial, there cannot be any gauge with the s all equal to the
identity.

conversely, given any complex 2-dimensional representation  of eg, we may dene an

action of eg on a bundle over ir4 by putting

(g, x) = (g)

(2.9)

relative to some background gauge. obviously this action restricts to the representation 

on the bre ea. in fact, if eg is a nite subgroup of su(2), any action of eg on e is of this

form for some representation . (this is so because ir4 is topologically trivial and can be
contracted to the xed-point set of the action. in general the classication of actions on
bundles is more complicated.)

given a bundle e with an action , we can state the condition for a gauge potential

to be symmetric:

a(gxg1) = (g, x)a(x)(g, x)1  (g, x)(g, x)1.

(2.10)

in this context, the s are often referred to as compensating gauge transformations a
practice we shall occasionally follow in this paper. the term (g, x)(g, x)1 vanishes
if the action is in the standard form (2.9). notice that if (2.10) is satised then the cur-
vature (eld-strength) transforms like f (gxg1) = (g, x)f (x)(g, x)1 and for example
the action density tr(ff ) is a g-invariant function on ir4.
technical remark since the object of physical signicance, the gauge potential, takes its
values in the adjoint bundle of e, it is most natural to impose symmetries on this bundle.
thus we suppose that g acts on ad(e), covering the action of g on ih (so g  g gives a
linear map ad(e)x  ad(e)gxg1 for every x in ih). then it does not necessarily follow
that such an action of g on ad(e) lifts to an action of eg on e. moreover this failure
occurs in at least one physically interesting example, the cubic instanton of [15].

to explain how this problem can be understood, we remark that, as above, the action of
g on ad(e) restricts to give a representation of g on ad(e)a for any point a xed by the
action. since ad(e)a may be identied with the lie algebra of su(2) and hence with ir3,
in general the image of g by this representation will be a subgroup of so(3) isomorphic

4

on ea and this extends, as in (2.9) to an action on the whole of e. however it is in general

to some quotient group f = g/h of g. in general the double cover ef  su(2) of f acts
not the case that ef is a quotient of the binary group eg. in the case of the cubic instanton,

g is the rotation group of the cube, h is the klein viergruppe (consisting of the identity
and the half-turns about the three coordinate axes) and f is isomorphic to the dihedral
group of order 6.

in the general case, it still happens that a double cover bg, say, acts on e, but this need

not be the binary group eg. with f, ef as above,

bg = {(g, f )  g  ef : p(g) = q(f )}.

here p : g  g/h = f is the map to the factor group and q : ef  f is the double-cover.
the restriction to bg of the projection g  ef  g is then a 2 : 1 map, as one can easily

verify from the denitions.

if g is the icosahedral group, this complication does not arise owing to the fact that g
is then a simple group (being isomorphic to the alternating group a5) and h must either
be 1 or g.

2.1 symmetric adhm data

returning to the adhm description (2.3), this will be eg-symmetric if for every g  eg, we

have compensating gauge transformations

(gxg1) = (cid:18) (g)

u(g)(cid:19) (x)u(g)1

(2.11)

for every g in eg. the rst matrix has been decomposed into blocks corresponding to (2.1)
so  is 1  1 and u is n  n. in order to preserve the shape of (x), u(g) must be the
product of a real orthogonal matrix with a unit quaternion, while (g) can be any unit
quaternion. (recall that the matrix m is symmetric.)

considering the coecient of x on each side of (2.11), we obtain

u(g)xu(g)1 = gxg111n.

(2.12)

by taking x = 1, i, j, k one deduces that u(g) = w(g)g where w(g) is real. hence adhm
data are eg-invariant if

(g)lw(g)1g1 = l, w(g)gmw(g)1g1 = m,

(2.13)

where w is a real n-dimensional representation of eg and  is a quaternionic 1-dimensional
representation of eg.
the reason for the notation (w, ) is that (x) can be viewed more invariantly as
an ih-linear map w  w  ih  e where w is an n-dimensional real vector space and
e is the bre at  of the bundle carrying our su(2) gauge potential. (the space w can
in turn be identied with the zero-modes of the coupled dirac operator, but we shall not

need this fact.) here we are using the su(2)-structure to think of e as a 1-dimensional
quaternionic vector space.

2.2 a little representation theory

the problem of choosing the representations w and  and of constructing the invariant
matrices (2.13) will now be considered. let us rst compare it with the analogous problem
of constructing symmetric nahm data (and hence symmetric monopoles [10, 12, 13]). the
single most important dierence between these problems is that in the nahm case one
knows which representation (the analogue of w) is going to arise. that is because one
knows that the nahm data form the irreducible n-dimensional representation of su(2) at
the end-points, and this su(2) really does correspond to the rotation group of ir3. thus
in the cited work on symmetric monopoles, the approach was to understand explicitly how

the invariants corresponding to the klein polynomials.

in the instanton case, by contrast, we do not have such information about w . since w

the standard representations of su(2) decompose under the action of eg, making use of
is identiable with a space of dirac zero-modes, one can compute the character of w as a eg-

representation space using some equivariant index theory, but the information coming from
this is not particularly useful. instead we exploit the fact that the representation theory
of nite subgroups of su(2) can be understood very explicitly. since every irreducible

representation of eg eventually appears in the standard representations of su(2), the two

approaches are closely related in principle, though this may be rather cumbersome in
practice.

we shall now, therefore, describe the irreducible representations of the binary icosahe-

dral group eg following john mckays famous paper[18]. mckay observed that a convenient
picture of the representation theory of eg is given by the extended e8 dynkin diagram:

3

each node stands for an irreducible representation of eg. here 1, . . . , 6 arise simply by
restriction of the corresponding representations of su(2) to eg. the other representations

6

2, 3, 4, of dimensions 2, 3, 4 respectively, will be described shortly. first we shall explain
the role of the edges in the diagram: the node  is joined to  if and only if  is a summand

in the decomposition of   2 into irreducible representations of eg. in general, this would
lead to a directed graph, but for subgroups of su(2),  occurs in 2 i  occurs in 2.
moreover, the multiplicity is always 0 or 1. thus we read o, for example 62 = 345.
since moreover as su(2)-representations, 6  2 = 5  7, we nd that

7 = 3  4 as representations of eg.

this decomposition corresponds to the existence of the icosahedral klein polynomial of
indeed the decomposition is equivalent to the existence of a non-trivial eg-
degree 12.

in view of this last observation, it remains to describe 2 and 3.
table of eg, these two representations look exactly like 2 and 3, but with the sign of 5
representations, in the following sense. identify eg with a nite subset of points of ih such
that all the coordinates of these points lie in q(5). in other words, for every g  eg, the
coecients of i, j, k, (as well as the real part) are each of the form a + b5, where a and b
are rationals. (we shall show how to do this in a moment.) consider the conjugation on
q(5),  7  which takes a + b5 to a  b5. then 2 is the representation x 7 gx,
3 is the representation x 7 gx(g)1 (on pure imaginary x) and 4 is the representation
x 7 gxg1. this recipe denes a representation because of the property  = ()
for any ,   q(5) and it is clear that the character of the primed representation is
obtained by changing the sign of 5, just as required. it so happens that only the primed
versions of 2 and of 3 are new representations. remark that despite the notation, 4 is not
the primed version of 4; we hope that no confusion will result from this notation.

in this discussion note that 3 and 4 are real representations: they act on im(ih) or ih,
viewed as 3 and 4-dimensional real vector spaces. by contrast, 2 is essentially complex;
it is not the complexication of any real representation. we point out further that 4 has

the following alternative description. a 5-dimensional representation of eg arises through
the identication of g with the alternating group a5 and letting this act by permutations
of the coordinates in ir5. this is the sum of a trivial representation and an irreducible
4-dimensional representation on v  ir5, v = {y  ir5 : y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 = 0}. this
representation on v is isomorphic to 4.
coxeter, in [9], gives a description of the binary icosahedral group (his notation is
h5, 3, 2i) which has the property mentioned above, namely that all coordinates lie in q(5).

for this, the icosahedron is oriented in such a way that the coordinate axes in ir3 pass
through edge-midpoints. in particular, the half-turns about the coordinate axes lie in g.

in terms of quaternions, these half-turns correspond to i, j, k. then eg is generated by
these together with one other element of order two such as u2 = (i +  j   1k)/2.
setting
(2.14)

u1 = j, u2 = (i +  j   1k)/2, u3 = i

one gets a set of generators of eg.

in terms of these, the ve-fold rotation is given by
a = u1u2, the three-fold rotation by b = u2u3 and the two-fold rotation by c = u3u1
and

a5 = b3 = c 2 = abc

we can now write explicitly the action of the generators u1, u2, u3 in the irreducible

necessary, we shall denote by  the action of eg in the representation corresponding to .

the following identities involving  will be used without comment in what follows:

 1 = (5  1)/2,   =  1,    1 = 1,  +  1 = 5,  2 +  2 = 3.
 thinking of 2 and 2 as quaternionic 1-dimensional representations, we have

2(i) = 2(i) = i, 2(j) = 2(j) = j, 2(k) = 2(k) = k,

2.3 the adhm description of an icosahedral 7-instanton

to construct the adhm data for an icosahedral instanton of charge n, we must choose a

maps and attempt to use them to solve the adhm constraints.

real representation of eg of dimension n (the space w ) and a 1-dimensional quaternionic
representation (the space e). having done so, we write down the most general eg-invariant
notational remark in the rest of this paper, we shall use the term eg-map to denote
any linear map between representation spaces of eg that intertwines the eg-actions. we
following the monopole situation, we suppose w = 7 = 3  4. from mckays

shall also often use schurs lemma without comment.

correspondence we have

3  2 = 6, 4  2 = 6  2.

w = 3  4, e = 2.

since l is required to be a eg-map from w  2 into e, there is only one possibility for
e which allows l 6= 0: the only 2-dimensional representation that occurs in w  2 is 2.
hence we take
(2.15)
the quaternionic matrix m is naturally viewed as a map w  w  2  2. the mckay
correspondence can be used also to calculate the space of such eg-maps. now m breaks
up naturally into a real component and a pure imaginary component, corresponding to
2  2 = 1  3. the real component of m must be a multiple of the identity on the
irreducible summands 3 and 4, yielding two free parameters. the pure imaginary part of
m gives maps 3  3 3, 3  4 3, and 4  4 3. from the mckay correspondence,
there are no non-zero maps 3  3  3, but there is in each case a one-dimensional space
of maps 3  4  3 and 4  4  3.
to sum up, we have the following parameter-count for eg-symmetric adhm data: one
in the component of l that maps 4  2  2; two from the real part of m; and three from
the imaginary part of m. in the following lemma we compute explicitly these invariant
maps. although maple has been used to assist with these computations, they are quite

more specically, this means that for each g  eg, we have

4  3  4. since this is skew symmetric, it cannot be used as a diagonal block in the
matrix m from the adhm data, since m is required to be symmetric. it follows that the
most general eg-invariant adhm data, with w = 3  4, is given by

where a, b, c, d are real numbers and we have used the fact that b is pure imaginary to
write bt = b. one computes

thus the adhm constrainsts are satised i a2 = c2 and c(b d) = 0. if c = 0, then a = 0
and the top row l of m is identically zero. this yields a singular instanton and hence is
not allowable. hence c 6= 0, b = d and a = c. since, moreover,

the two choices of sign lead to gauge-equivalent adhm data and hence to gauge-equivalent
instantons.

what we have found is a charge-7 icosahedral instanton that is unique up to the ob-

a maple calculation shows that (x)(x) is invertible for every x, so that this is a non-
singular instanton.

2.4 the associated skyrmion

having constructed the adhm data for an icosahedral instanton we now wish to make
use of this to compute a skyrme eld. recall the proposal of atiyah and manton[2] which
results in the following explicit prescription for the skyrme eld

u(x) = p exp(cid:18) z +



a4(x, x4) dx4(cid:19).

(2.18)

here u(x) is the su(2)-valued skyrme eld in ir3, p denotes path ordering and a is the
gauge potential of a yang-mills instanton eld in ir4.
for an instanton of charge n this holonomy produces a skyrme eld with baryon number
n. although this procedure does not give exact solutions to the skyrme model it does give
elds which are good approximations to important skyrmion congurations, in the sense
of having not only the correct symmetries but also energies which are only a few percent
above those of the numerically known skyrmion solutions. for example, the 1-instanton
generates a hedgehog skyrme eld and by adjusting the scale of the instanton, which
may be regarded as a free parameter in the approximation, it is possible to obtain an
approximation whose energy is only 1% above that of the true solution (which is known
only numerically).

the minimal energy skyrmions of charge two, three and four have axial, tetrahedral
and cubic symmetry respectively[7].
in each of these cases instantons have been found
with the correct symmetries, so that computing their holonomies produces skyrme elds
which are good approximations to these skyrmions[2, 15]. it should be noted that in these
multi-instanton examples the holonomy can not be computed analytically and therefore

numerical methods must be employed. specically, if eu (x, x4) denotes the solution of the

matrix ordinary dierential equation

with the initial condition eu(x,) = 112, then u(x) = eu(x,). the above set of ordinary

dierential equations, with x regarded as a parameter, need to be solved numerically, for

(2.19)

4eu = a4eu

11

which we employ a standard runge-kutta method. in principle, since we have the adhm
data explicitly, it is possible to obtain an exact analytic expression for a4 by performing
some quaternionic linear algebra. however, this is a non-trivial computation, even with
the use of a symbolic computer algebra package, and is of little practical use. furthermore,
since we are employing a numerical algorithm to solve equation (2.19) then it is sensible
to compute a4 numerically also. to achieve this, note that equation (2.4) states that the
vector n(x) is orthogonal to each of the columns of the matrix (x). thus we can compute
n(x) using a quaternionic gram-schmidt orthonormalization process and hence a4(x) by
using a nite dierence approximation to equation (2.5).

applying our numerical scheme to the adhm data of the icosahedral 7-instanton de-
rived above we obtain a skyrme eld whose baryon density isosurface is displayed in figure
1.11. this surface, which looks identical to that obtained from full eld simulations of the
skyrme model[4], resembles a dodecahedron, with the baryon density being maximal at the
vertices of the dodecahedron and holes at the centre of each face. we have not attempted
to nd the instanton scale at which the energy of this skyrme eld is minimized since to
perform an accurate calculation would require a more substantial amount of computing
time. the important point is that we have demonstrated that an icosahedrally symmetric
7-instanton exists whose holonomy produces a good approximation to the minimal energy
7-skyrmion.

3 seven skyrmion scattering

the aim of this section is to obtain a family of instantons which describes a seven
skyrmion scattering process in which seven well separated skyrmions merge to form the
dodecahedral 7-skyrmion. in order to understand this scattering it is useful to rst consider
the analogous situation for monopoles, since from numerical simulations it appears that
many skyrmion scattering events are remarkably similar to known monopole scatterings[5].
a dodecahedral 7-monopole exists[12] whose energy density isosurface looks very similar
to the baryon density isosurface shown in figure 1.11. in fact it was known earlier that
a tetrahedral 3-monopole and a cubic 4-monopole also exist[10] and again they resemble
the corresponding skyrmions[13]. in studying symmetric monopoles it is useful to consider
rational maps, which we outline below.

the n-monopole moduli space is dieomorphic to the space of degree n rational maps
between riemann spheres, with the equivalence relation that two maps that are equal after
a rotation of the target sphere are identied. the rational map arises from the monopole
as the scattering data along a half-line emanating from a chosen origin[14]. explicitly, let
z be a point on the riemann sphere and consider hitchins equation

(dr  i)s = 0

(3.1)

for the two-component eld s, along the radial half-line through the point z. here dr is
the covariant derivative in the radial direction and  is the higgs eld. up to a constant
multiple, there is a unique solution s = (s1, s2)t which decays as r  . let r be the

12

ratio of the components of this solution evaluated at the origin, that is, r = s1
s2|r=0. now
consider how r varies as we choose a new direction for the half-line by changing the value
of z. then, as proved by jarvis[14], r is a holomorphic function of z of degree n, where n
is the charge of the monopole elds occuring in (3.1). the eect of a gauge transformation
is to transform r by an su(2) mobius transformation, and after taking this equivalence
into account, there is a one-to-one correspondence between n-monopoles and rational maps
r(z) of degree n.

if a map r(z), of degree n, is g-invariant (up to mobius transformations) then there
is an n-monopole with symmetry g, and vice versa. in ref.[11] many symmetric maps are
presented but the one of relevance here is the following degree seven map which arises after
the imposition of the symmetry th

r(z) =

bz6  7z4  bz2  1
z(z6 + bz4 + 7z2  b)

.

(3.2)

th is the group of rotations of a tetrahedron extended by inversion symmetry and, after a
choice of orientation, the above one-parameter family, with b real, gives all such maps. since
this one-parameter family is the xed point set of a group action then it is a geodesic in the
7-monopole moduli space. using the geodesic approximation[17] this family describes a
low energy seven monopole scattering process as b varies along the real line from  to .
changing the sign of b can be undone with a mobius transformation plus the replacement
z 7 iz, which corresponds to a rotation by 90 about the x1-axis. if b = 7/5 then

the map has icosahedral symmetry, and represents the dodecahedral 7-monopole and its
dual, whereas at b = 0, which is the midpoint of the scattering process, the map has cubic
symmetry. in the limit as b   the map degenerates to r(z) = z, which represents a
single monopole at the origin, the other six monopoles having moved o to innity along
the cartesian axes.

in summary this geodesic models a scattering event where six monopoles, moving in
along the cartesian axes, merge with a single monopole at the origin to form rst a
dodecahedron and then a cube, after which the process reverses but with a 90 rotation.
the purpose of the remainder of this section is to present a one-parameter family of skyrme
elds which describe a similar scattering of skyrmions. at this point it is important to
note that although an ansatz exists for skyrme elds in terms of rational maps[11], this
approximation only works for skyrme elds which have a shell-like structure. thus, for
example, using the rational map (3.2) with b = 7/5 gives a good approximation to the
dodecahedral 7-skyrmion, but the rational map ansatz breaks down for large b and can
not be used to describe well separated skyrmions. thus we need to turn to the instanton
approximation to attempt to produce skyrme elds which describe this process.

the upshot of the above discussion is that we now want to consider 7-instantons with

symmetry th.

3.1 tetrahedral deformations of the icosahedral instanton

we have described the general framework for the construction of symmetric adhm data.
what we seek now is the most general family of tetrahedral 7-instantons that contains the

in su(2) of the rotation group of the tetrahedron. to study tetrahedral deformations, we

icosahedral 7-instanton. denote by et the binary tetrahedral group, i.e. the double cover
realize et as a subgroup of eg generated by i, j, k and the three-fold rotation (1 + i + j +
k)/2. (we continue to take eg to be generated by the ui of (2.14).) conjugation by this
given representations of eg yield representations of et and we can attempt to follow the

procedure described above. it is preferable rst to impose the inversion from the subgroup
th, however, since this forces the two diagonal blocks in m to be zero.

quaternion gives a 120-rotation about the axis in the direction (1, 1, 1) in ir3. then the

to explain this, we must rst show in what sense the data (2.17) are inversion sym-
metric. for this we must again nd compensating gauge transformations j1 and j2 such
that

it is easy to see that the essentially unique choice for this, in the case of the adhm data
(2.17), is given by

(x) = j1(x)j 1
2 .

j1 =

0

0
0
114
0
0 113


 , j2 = (cid:18)114

0

0

113(cid:19) .

the reason for the simple form of these matrices is that the inversion x 7 x is central
and so must act by  the identity in any irreducible representation of eg.

now any adhm data that is inversion-symmetric in this sense must have the form

m = 


v
0
0 c
c t
0




relative to the usual block-decomposition. the row-vector v and 4  3 matrix c are
constrained by having to be symmetric under et , where this acts by restriction of the
given eg-representations. since 2 = 2 and 3 = 3 as et representations, we have that
4 = 2  2 = 1  3 as et -representations. one may check that v is invariant i it has the

form (0, 1i, 1j, 1k) and that c is invariant if it has the form

c =




2i 2j 2k
p
rj
qi
rk
qj
p

qk
p
ri




where 0, 1, 2, p, q, r are real numbers.

the next task is to impose the adhm constraints; these yield the equations

im(vv + cc t) = 0, im(c c) = 0.

14

it is straightforward to show that these reduce to the three equations

01 = 2(p + q  r), 2

1 = qr  p(q  r), 2

2 = qr + p(q  r).

solving for the s in terms of p, q, r, we conclude that the general th invariant adhm
data are given by

where

0 = (p + q  r)vuut qr + p(q  r)

qr  p(q  r)

, 1 = qqr  p(q  r), 2 = qqr + p(q  r).

(3.4)

here we have three free parameters, p, q, r, but we require only a one-parameter family
for our application. one of the free parameters is an overall scale factor, which corresponds
to the multiplication of m by a scale, and this can only be determined by computing the
energy of the associated skyrme eld. we will therefore set this scale to one, as it can be
easily reintroduced later. as p, q, r are homogeneous coordinates we can x this scale by
setting r = q1.

to get some insight into the interpretation of the parameters, let us consider the special
case p = 0. then from (3.4), 0 = (q q1), 1 = 2 = 1; denote the corresponding matrix
(3.3) by m (q). if q =  , then 0 = 1 and m ( ) coincides with the icosahedral matrix
(2.17). if q is interpreted as the exponential of a time parameter t, then q runs from 0
to  as t runs from  to , and time-reversal is the transformation q  q1. this
transformation is equivalent to a 90 rotation about the x1 axis. indeed if we denote by
n (q) the adhm data obtained from m (q) by replacing q by q1, i by i, j by k and k by
j, then we have

we conclude that the value q =  1 is also a dodecahedral instanton (obtained from (2.17)
by a 90 rotation) and that at q = 0 we have an instanton symmetric under the symmetry

15

group of the cube (since this group is generated by the tetrahedral group together with
any 90 rotation about one of the coordinate axes).

this one-parameter family thus has all the symmetry properties expected of the seven
skyrmion scattering process. however it turns out that it does not have the correct asymp-
totic behaviour as q goes to 0 or . this was veried both by numerical work and asymp-
totic analysis. the problem can be traced to the fact that the rst entry of the top row
(q  q1) blows up as q  0,.
therefore we try to nd a more general family with the same symmetry properties but
allow p 6= 0 to improve the asymptotic behaviour. in particular we want time-reversal to
continue to correspond to the replacement q 7 q1. then it can be seen that if we make
the replacements
(3.7)

q 7 q1, p 7 p, i 7 i, j 7 k, k 7 j

which, because of (3.4), result in

0 7 0, 1 7 1, 2 7 2,

(3.8)

equivalent adhm data are obtained. (the compensating gauge transformation is as in
(3.5) and (3.6).) note that the xed point set of the time reversal transformation, in other
words the midpoint of the scattering process, is given by q = 1, p = 0, which indeed has
cubic symmetry as it should.

these arguments show that if p is any function of q with the properties

p(q1) = p(q), p( ) = 0

(3.9)

then the corresponding family of adhm matrices will have the correct symmetry prop-
erties: the rst condition gives that the data at q and at q1 are equivalent up to a
90-rotation; the second ensures that the data at  reduce to the icosahedral data (2.17).
we are now left with nding the variable p as a function of q; this can not be determined

from symmetry arguments alone. a simple function satisfying (3.9) is given by

p = 

(q  q1)((q  q1)2  1)

(q  q1)4 + 1

.

(3.10)

the numerator of p is the simplest function having the required zeros and symmetry
properties, whereas at this stage the only fact we know about the denominator is that it
must be a symmetric function of (q  q1). however, as we shall now see, the form of
the denominator is highly constrained by examining the asymptotic limit of the scattering
process, where all seven instantons are well separated, and this leads naturally to the given
solution.

order behaviour of p is

the asymptotic out state corresponds to the limit q  , and in this limit the leading
(3.11)

p = q1 + o(q5).

hence in this limit we nd that

0 =

1
2

+ o(q2), 1 = 2 + o(q2), 2 = q1 + o(q3).

(3.12)

this matrix is of the form identied by christ, stanton and weinberg[8] as representing
well separated instantons. the leading order terms lie on the diagonal of the square part
of the matrix and determine the instanton positions, giving one instanton at the origin and
the other six on the cartesian axes at a distance q from the origin. the terms of next order
all lie on the top row of the matrix and these give the scales and su(2) orientations of the
instantons. the fact that all the entries on the top row have unit length means that each
instanton has scale one. since the rst entry in the top row is one, then on computing the
holonomy the skyrmion at the origin will be in standard orientation, whereas, for example,
the fact that the second and sixth entries in the top row are i, means that the skyrmions
located on the x3-axis have an orientation which is obtained from the standard one by
rotating the skyrmion by 180 around the x1-axis. these kinds of congurations, that is
three collinear skyrmions such that the outer skyrmions are rotated by 180 about a line
perpendicular to the line joining the inner skyrmion, are known to give attractive initial
conditions for full eld simulations[5]. thus we see that our adhm data has the correct
asymptotic properties to produce the conguration which we require.

17

now we address the possible freedom in the choice (3.10) that we have made. the
main eect of changing the denominator in (3.10) is to alter the scale of the instanton at
the origin in the limit in which the other six are far from it. the requirement that this
scale is nite as q   determines that the leading term in the denominator of p must be
(q q1)4 with coecient one. only even powers of (q q1) are allowed by symmetry and
it can be shown that the coecient of (q  q1)2 must be zero if the scale of the instanton
at the origin is to be not only nite but equal in value to the scale of the instantons which
are moving along the cartesian axes. there remains the freedom to change the value of
the constant in the denominator of (3.10) but clearly this has little eect since it is only
relevant for small values of (q  q1) and the numerator contains (q  q1) as a factor.
using this adhm data for increasing values of q we compute skyrme elds whose
baryon density isosurfaces are shown in figure 1. the various values of q corresponding to
each gure are given in the table below.

table 1. parameter values for the scattering shown in figure 1.

from figure 1 we see that indeed our family of instantons describes the sought after
scattering process. figure 1.1 clearly shows the six skyrmions on the cartesian axes and
a skyrmion at the origin. as the skyrmions approach, figure 1.2, the one at the origin
shrinks until it disappears completely, figure 1.3. the skyrmions then merge until the
dodecahedron is formed, figure 1.5, after which the conguration twists until it turns into
a cube, figure 1.8. this process is then reversed but accompanied by a 90 rotation around
the x1-axis, so that for example the dual dodecahedron is formed, figure 1.11, and the
skyrmions nally separate again along the cartesian axes, figure 1.15.

an important dierence between monopoles and skyrmions is that monopoles are bps
solitons, and therefore all congurations of the same charge have equal energy, whereas for
skyrmions this is certainly not the case and the potential energy of dierent congurations
is an important factor in considering the dynamics. we have not computed the scale factor
of each conguration to minimize the energy of our skyrme elds since, although this could
be done if required, it would involve a substantial amount of computing time. however, we
have ensured that the scale factor is the order of unity for all q, so that we get an accurate
representation of the baryon density isosurfaces. qualitatively we know that for all the
family of skyrme elds the energy per skyrmion is less than it is for seven well separated
skyrmions, and that the minimum energy congurations are the two dodecahedra. from
numerical simulations[6] it is known that the energy of the cubic 7-skyrmion is above
that of the dodecahedron but it is still substantially less than that of seven well separated
skyrmions. thus the true dynamical evolution depends upon the initial speeds of the

18

incoming skyrmions, together with the amount of energy lost through radiation as the
process evolves. however, it is expected that if the incoming speeds are great enough then
the whole scattering process displayed in figure 1 would take place. radiation eects will
mean that for most speeds the incoming skyrmions will eventually get trapped at one
of the dodecahedra, and perhaps if the skyrmions are initially static then only the rst
portion of the scattering process will occur and the cube may never be formed, but this
depends upon the amount of radiation generated. by performing full eld simulations,
using the numerical code described in [5, 6], with initial conditions given by the instanton
generated skyrme eld, it has been veried that the true dynamical evolution does follow
the sequence described above and the family of instanton generated skyrme elds provides
an accurate approximation to the skyrmion scattering process.

in current approaches to the quantization of skyrmions a rst step is to examine the
vibrational modes of the minimal energy skyrmion at each charge[3]. thus for charge seven
it is the vibrational modes of the dodecahedral skyrmion which need to be studied and
clearly one mode is the tetrahedral deformation we have displayed. thus if the amplitude
of the deformation is sucient then one of the important vibrational modes will be the
one considered here where the dodecahedron deforms to its dual via a cube.

4 conclusion

we have used the adhm construction to present a charge seven instanton with icosahe-
dral symmetry whose holonomy generates a skyrme eld which approximates the minimial
energy dodecahedral 7-skyrmion. furthermore, by imposing tetrahedral symmetry we have
found a family of adhm data which we used to generate skyrme elds that model a seven
skyrmion scattering process that results in the formation of the dodecahedral 7-skyrmion.
there are a number of other highly symmetric skyrmions, such as the icosahedrally
symmetric charge seventeen skyrmion which resembles a buckyball[11], and the methods
used here could also be applied to construct the adhm data of the predicted correspond-
ing instantons. in particular it would be interesting if the instanton approach led to an
understanding of the formation of the buckyball 17-skyrmion from individual skyrmions.
