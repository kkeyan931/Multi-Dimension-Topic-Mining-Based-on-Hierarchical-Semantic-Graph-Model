abstract

the consequences of coupling of the torsion (highest curvature) term to the lagrangian of a
massive spinless particle in four-dimensional space time are studied. it is shown that the modied
system remains spinless and possesses extended gauge invariance. though the torsion term does
not generate spin, it provides the system with a nontrivial mass spectrum, described by one-
dimensional conformal mechanics. under an appropriate choice of characteristic constants the
system has solutions with a discrete mass spectrum.

1 introduction

the search of lagrangian models, describing spinning particles, has a long story. most popular
approach in this direction is the formulation of the lagrangian on the space-time, extended by the
anticommuting variables, which upon quantization provide the system with the nontrivial spin. this
approach is closely related with the supersymmetric eld theories and is essential for the formulation
of superparticle systems.

there is another, pure bosonic, approach in which the lagrangian is formulated on the direct
product of the initial space-time by some orbit of poincare group. the actions of this sort are, in fact,
the particle counterparts of born-infeld type systems. this approach seems to be interesting due its
visible relation with orbit method of kirillov-konstant-souriau [1]. most developed investigation of
such systems has been presented in refs. [2]. notice that the bosonic approach is the only correct in
(2 + 1)-dimensional systems, due to anyonic nature of planar particle.

the bosonic approach admits an aesthetically attractive modication, where the additional bosonic
variables are encoded in the dependence of the lagrangian on higher-order derivatives. these systems
seem to be interesting not only for their clear geometrical meaning. the higher-derivative parts in
their lagrangians can be generated by some eld-theoretical mechanism, e.g. arising as quantum
corrections. investigation of such sort of particle systems became popular after remarkable work of
polyakov [3], where he show, that evaluation of the eective action of cp 1 model minimally coupled
to the chern-simons eld for the charged solitonic excitation results in the action

sef f = z (m +


2

k2)|dx|,

(1.1)

where k2 is world-lines torsion and  is eld coupling strength.

later it was found, that this system describes anyonic analog of majorana eld equations [4]. due
to further studies it became a part of physical folklore that relativistic systems can get nontrivial spin,
if one adds to the lagrangians the higher-derivatives terms (more precisely, the terms, depending on
reparametrization invariants (extrinsic curvatures) of world-line). some signicant observations were
done in connection with this subject, particularly, in the description of three- and four- dimensional
particle with majorana spectrum [7], 4d massless particles [5]. the relation of the mentioned massless
particle model with w algebras has also been established [6].
only the rst and second extrinsic curvatures were considered.
in this note we attempt to ll this gap and consider the simplest four-dimensional analog of (1.1)
given by the action [8]

however, such systems were not studied completely even in the four- dimensional space-time, where

s = z (c0 + ck3)ds,

ds = |dx|  sd 6= 0

(1.2)

where  is an arbitrary evolution parameter and k3 is the torsion (highest curvature) of a worldline
in 4d space.

we will show that this system possesses interesting properties which make it drastically dierent
from other four- and three- dimensional massive particle systems depending on extrinsic curvatures:

 it has a zero spin;
 it possesses, in addition to reparametrization invariance, the extra gauge degrees of freedom: its

classical trajectories are restricted by the condition

where q = k1/k2, and m denotes the mass of the system.
when  < 0, the upper sign corresponds to the time-like trajectories, while other solutions
corresponds to the space-like ones.

 when  < 1/2, the solutions with space-like trajectories possess a discrete spectrum with
massive and tachionic sectors, while the solutions with time-like trajectories possess continuous
spectrum containing massive, massless, and tachionic solutions.

the paper is arranged as follows:

in section 2 we construct the hamiltonian system corresponding to the model under consideration
(1.2). we show that the system possesses an extended gauge invariance and a zero spin. the geometry
of its classical trajectories and quantum spectrum (in the euclidean space) are dened by the one-
dimensional conformal mechanics (with a repulsive potential).

in section 3 we reformulate the hamiltonian system constructed in section 2 in the minkowski

space and consider the properties of its mass spectrum.

2 hamiltonian formulation

in this section we give the hamiltonian formulation of the model (1.2).

recall that the extrinsic curvatures ka of a (non-null) curve in four-dimensional space can be

dened via the frenet equations for the moving frame ea :

x = se1,

a cb = 


ea = k b

,

ka1 = ska1,

(2.1)

(2.2)

where x are coordinates of four-dimensional space, and ea are elements of the moving frame.
while k1, k2 are positive quantities, the sign of the highest curvature k3 (torsion) is not uniquely
dened by the frenet equations [9]. without loss of generality we assume below that k3 > 0.

in the euclidean space ab = ab, so the frenet equations read

one can transform the frenet equations in the euclidean space into those in the minkowski space,

ea = kaea+1  ka1ea1,

e0 = e5  0.

(2.3)

performing the following transition

(ea, ka, ka1, s)  (iea, ika, ika1, (i)1a s)

(2.4)

for some index a.
indeed, this transformation preserves the form of the matrix in (2.2), while the element ea becomes
time-like: e2
a = 1. so, we can give our basic derivations for the euclidean case, reformulating them
for the minkowski space for a nal analysis.

it follows from (2.3) that

s =  x2,

ka = eaea+1 = q e2

a  k2

a1.

(2.5)

thus, the lagrangian appearing in the action (1.2) in the euclidean space can be replaced by the
following one

l = c0s + cq e2

3  k2

2 + p( x  se1) +xi

pi1( ei1  ki1ei + ki2ei2) xi,j

dij (eiej  ij ), (2.6)

where x, p, ei, pi1, s, ki, dij are independent variables, i, j = 1, 2, 3.

3

now we can perform the legendre transformation for this lagrangian (referring for details to [10]).
the variables pi1 represent the momenta conjugated to ei1, whereas the momenta conjugated to
(s, ki1, dij) lead to the trivial constraints
ps  0,

pi1  0,

pij  0.

(2.7)

setting k3 6= 0 we nd that the momentum conjugated to e3 is of the form

taking into account (2.5), we get the constraints

p3 = c(cid:0) e2

3  k2

2(cid:1)1/2

e3.

p3e3  0, p3e1  0, p2

3  (p3e2)2  c2  0.

(2.8)

(2.9)

then the construction of primary hamiltonian system becomes straightforward.

to simplify the resulting system, one can stabilize trivial primary constraints (2.7) and exclude
them from our considerations, which makes the variables s, ki1, dij lagrangian multipliers. without
loss of generality one can also impose the gauge conditions (see for a details [10])

after these manipulations we get the hamiltonian system

p3e2  0, p2e2  0, p2e1  0.

 = dp  dx +pi dpi  dei,

h = s(pe1  c0) +pi ki1i1.i + k3

with primary constraints

pe1  c0  0,

i1.i  pi1ei  piei1  0, p2
where variables s, ki, dij play the role of lagrangian multipliers.

3  c2  0,

let us stabilize the primary constraints (2.11)-(2.14).

stabilization of (2.11) gives the following xation of the lagrangian multipliers dij :

so that the equations of motion read

2di.j = k3ci.3j.3  sc01.i1.j,

x = e1,

e1 = k1e2,

e2 = k1e1 + k2e3,
e3 = k2e2 + k3p3/c
p3 = k3ce3  k2p2,
p2 = k1p1 + k2p3,

p1 = sp + k1p2 + sc0e1,

p = 0.

(2.10)

(2.11)
(2.12)

(2.13)
(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

stabilizing the remaining primary constraints, we get the following rst-stage secondary constraints

pe2  0, p1e3  0, p3p2  0.

(2.17)

4

from the ortogonality of (ei, p3/c) to p2, which follows from (2.14),(2.11),(2.17) we conclude that

stabilizing the rst and second constraints from (2.17) and the constraint (2.18), we get

p2  0.

where

then we get

where

k2 = qk1,

k3 = sc0/cq2,

p1 = qp3,

1/q 

pe3
c0

6= 0.

p = c0e1 + c0e3/q + pp3,

consistency of the equations of motion (2.16) with the frenet equations implies that

p  pp3/c2.

ea = {ei, e4  p3/c} :

eaeb = ab.

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

(2.24)

therefore, the initial hamiltonian system can be formulated purely in terms of the moving frame ea,
coordinates x, and momentum p, while the relations (2.24), (2.22) play the role of constraints.

taking into account the constraint (2.22)), we get the expressions for the rotation generators:

j = p  x +xi

pi  ei = p  (x  qp3/c0)

and the casimirs

p2 = (cp)2 + c2

0(1 + 1/q2), w2  (p  j)2 = 0.

(2.25)

(2.26)

thus, the system possesses a zero spin despite the dependence of the initial lagrangian on higher
derivatives.

the expression for rotation generators (2.25) hints us to introduce the eective coordinate

x  x  qp3/c0 :

x = sp/c0, p = const

(2.27)

whose evolution equations look similar to the convenient relation between velocity and momentum of
a massive particle (note, that in spite of these relations the mass of the system is not equal to c0).

the reduction of the initial hamiltonian system (2.10) by the constraints (2.24), (2.22), (2.20)

leads to the following unconstrained system

red = dp  dx +

dp  dq, hred =

the external curvatures of the system are related with the modular coordinate q as follows

k 2

2 k3

.

(2.28)

(2.29)

so, the system under consideration possesses extended gauge invariance since the trajectories with the
same ratio k1/k2 are gauge equivalent.

reducing the system (2.28) by p, to exclude the trivial part of dynamics (2.27), we get that the

evolution of the parameter q is described by the textbook mechanical system [11]

dp  dq, h0 = p2/2 +

as well as at the quantum one.

thus, adding of the torsion term increases the absolute value of momenta of the system with
0. the system (2.30) is known in literature as a conformal

respect to the torsionless system, p2  c2
mechanics, due to the symmetry of its action under conformal transformations generated by

h0 = p2/2 +

c2
0q2 , d = pq, k = q2/2 .
2c2

(2.31)

the energy spectrum is continuous and has the lowest bound e = 0 which is not normalizable. in
[12] the conformal symmetry of this system has been used for solving the problem of the ground state.
recently this mechanism has been found to be adequate to the problem of motion of charged
particle in the eld of a charged black hole [13]. due to this observation the interest to the conformal
mechanics and its supergeneralizations [14], is renewed in the context of study of probe d0-brane
dynamics in the external d-brane eld (see e.g.[15] and refs therein). conformal mechanics arises in
our model a dierent context: it denes local gauge symmetry of the particle system.

3 transition to minkowski space

in the previous section we constructed the constrained hamiltonian system corresponding to the
action (1.2) in the euclidean space. we found that the evolution and the geometry of this system are
described in terms of the non-relativistic conformal mechanics with repulsive potential. the purpose
of this section is to consider the relativistic aspects of this system, i.e. to investigate the model (1.2)
in the minkowski space. as we have mentioned in the beginning of section 2, we can use the results
concerning the euclidean case, since the frenet formulae in the euclidean space can be transformed
into the ones in minkowski space with the use of transition (2.4), where a denotes an element of
moving frame which becomes time-like, i.e. e2
a = 1. correspondingly, for the transition to time-like
trajectories we have to choose a = 1, while for the transition to space-like trajectories we have to
choose a 6= 1. we do not consider here systems with light-like trajectories.

for convenience we will use the notation

p2  m 2,  =

c0
c

,

(3.1)

so that m 2 >, =, < 0 corresponds to the massive, massless, and tachionic sectors of the system,
respectively.

to reformulate the system under consideration in the minkowski space we have to supply the
transition (2.4) with appropriate transformations of characteristic constants c0, c and momenta pi
which preserve the form of the initial action (1.2) and the initial hamiltonian system, namely,

a = 1 :
a = 2 :
a = 3 :
a = 4 :

(e1, p1, k1, s, c0)  (ie1,ip1, ik1,is, ic0);
(e2, p2, k2, k1)  (ie2,ip2, ik2, ik1),
(e3, p3, k3, k2, c)  (ie3,ip3, ik3, ik2,ic),

(c, k3)



(ic, ik3).

(3.2)

indeed, it is easy to see that it is only the ortonormality condition eaeb = (1)aaab that is changes
in (2.10) under this transformation. consequently, the reduced system (2.30) with appropriately
changed parameters describes the eective hamiltonian system corresponding to the action (1.2) in
the minkowski space.

6

the transition (3.2) induces the following transformation of the parameters and coordinates of the

reduced system (2.30)

(p, q, , c0, s) 

thus, the reduced system reads

(p, q, , c0, s)

(p, iq, i, ic0,is)
(ip,iq, i, c0, s)
(p, q, i, c0, s)

if a = 1
if a = 2
if a = 3
if a = 4.

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

thus, in both cases the system possesses the solutions described by conformal mechanics with a
repulsive (a = 1, 2) and an attractive (a = 3, 4) potentials. the classical solutions of these systems
are of the form

q2 = (cid:26) eas2 + (1)[a]2/ea,

2s,

if e 6= 0,

if e = 0, a = 3, 4

when the potential is attractive (a = 3, 4), the parameter s is dened on the domain

s  (cid:26) ]  |/e|,

]|/e|, [,

|/e|[,

if e < 0,
if e > 0.

while the quantum spectrum of the mechanics with a repulsive potential is continuous, the spectrum
of conformal mechanics with an attractive potential can be both continuous and discrete. the discrete
spectrum corresponds to the strongly attractive potential (|| > 1/2) and has an innite number of
energy levels [16].

we rst consider the systems with repulsive potential

dp  dq, h0 =

2q2 ,

2 = (cid:26) (1  m 2/c2
2e
0),
(1 + m 2/c2
0),

if  < 0, a = 0
if  > 0, a = 1

(3.6)

notice that while in the rst case trajectories are time-like, those are space-like in the second case.
since the energy e is positive both in classical and quantum cases, we get the restrictions on the
admissible value of the mass

for  < 0 and time-like trajectories (a = 1),

 m 2 < c2
0,
 m 2 < c2

0, for  > 0, a = 2.

7

thus, in the rst case there are massive, massless, and tachionic states, while in the second case the
system is tachionic.

now we consider the systems with an attractive potential. in this case all trajectories are space-like

and are dened by the mechanics

dp  dq, h0 =

2 = (cid:26) (1 + m 2/c2
2e

0)
(1 + m 2/c2
0)

if  < 0, a = 3
if  > 0, a = 4

(3.7)

the spectrum of conformal mechanics with an attractive potential is continuous for e > 0 and for
e  0, 2 < 1/4 (see [11]).
if the potential is strongly attractive 2 > 1/4, and e < 0, the system has a dicrete spectrum
with an innite number of bound states given by the expression [16]

en = h2b2 exp 2n
p2  1/4

, n = 0,1,2, . . . ,

where b is an undened phase factor.
so,

n/c2

 (cid:19)2

|| > 1/2.

(3.8)

therefore, for  > 0 the discrete branch corresponds to pure tachionic states, while for  < 0 it
contains massive, massless, and tachionic sectors.
