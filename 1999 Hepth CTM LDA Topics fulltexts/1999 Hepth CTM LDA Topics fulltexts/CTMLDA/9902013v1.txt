abstract

the bogolyubov transformations of eld variables in the holomor-
phic representation are generalized to systems with constraints where
the evolution parameter in the reduced phase space is one of the dy-
namical variables of the extended phase space.

the bogolyubov quasiparticles are determined by the diagonaliza-
tion of the equations of motion (but not only of the hamiltonian)
to get conserved numbers of quasiparticles. this approach is ap-
plied for the description of particle creation in the models of early
universe.

1 introduction

the bogolyubov transformations [1] were applied to get the energy spectrum of the weakly
non-ideal bose gas and they can be considered as an eective mathematical tool to construct
integrals of motion of complicate systems.

in this paper, we apply the bogolyubov transformations to construct integrals of motion of

constrained systems invariant with respect to reparametrization of time: t = t(t).

this reparametrization-time invariant system plays an important role for the theory of
gravitation, in particular, for the description of the early universe. the main problems of
consideration of the constrained systems are to extract the invariant dynamics with respect to
an internal evolution parameter, and to get corresponding integrals of motion. recently, the
invariant dynamic description of constrained systems was formulated using explicit resolving the
energy constraint [2, 3, 4]. it allows us to remove one of variables (with a negative contribution
into the constraint) from the phase space, to convert it to the internal evolution parameter of the
corresponding reduced system, and to nd the relationship between this evolution parameter
and the measurable time interval in gravitation [2, 3, 4] and cosmological models [5].

the problem of the present paper is to construct integrals of motion by the bogolyubov
transformations in the context of the above-mentioned hamiltonian reduction [2, 3, 4].
in
the next section, we formulate the problem using as an example an oscillator-like model of a
massive scalar eld in the frw metric [6, 7, 8, 9]. in section 3, we introduce the bogolyubov
transformations to diagonalize equations of motion. section 4 is devoted to the description of
creation of a massive particle in the early universe.

2 statement of problem

we rst consider an oscillator-like model of a massive particle in the at frw metric described
by the action [6, 7, 8, 9]

w e = z t2

t1

dt(p q  p0   n[

p 2
0
4v0

+ h(p, q)]) ,

where  is the cosmic scale factor (r/r0) multiplied by the planck constant

,

h(p, q) is the hamiltonian of a massive particle

h =

1
2

(p2 + q22()) ; 2() = k2 + 2,

(1)

(2)

(3)

v0 is a three-dimensional space-volume. action (1) retains the main peculiarity of gr, the
invariance under reparametrization of the coordinate time: t  t = t(t). the problem is to
nd the evolution of variables p0, , p, q with respect to the invariant conformal time

ndt = n dt = dt

(4)

of an observer in the comoving frame of reference.

as a consequence of the time-reparametrization invariance, the set of classical equations

is accompanied by the constraint

w

= 0  

p 2

4v0

+ h = 0

with two solutions

(p0) = 2qv0h.

the substitution of this solution into the equation for p0 (the third equation in (5)) leads to
the equation:

the integral form of this equation

is known [5] as the friedmann law of the evolution of the measurable time interval with respect
to the scale factor (2) of the universe.

to solve equation (9), we need the dependence of physical variables on the scale factor ,

which can be found from (5) with the use of equation (8)

dq

dt = d

dt

dq

d = q() dq

d = p

(10)

dp

dt = d

d = q() dp

d = 2()q.

the scale factor  in this equations represents the internal evolution parameter. we can nd
the corresponding reduced action for eqs.(10) by the substitution of the explicit solution of the
constraint (6),(7) into the initial action (1):

w r =

2=(t2)

z1=(t1)

d[p

dq

d  2qv0h].

(11)

thus, the considered hamiltonian reduction (11) of the time-reparametrization invariant sys-
tems faces three times:

 the rst is the coordinate time (t) in the initial extended action (1).
 the second time is the internal evolution parameter of the reduced system (11) which is

one of former variables of the extended system ().

 every action of relativistic theory has to be supplemented with a geometrical convention
which connects a measurable invariant interval (t ) (4) with variables of the extended
system.

3

the friedmann law of the universe evolution is a consequence both of the variation principle

for action (1) (or (11)) and the convention (4) [2, 3, 4].

the einstein theory of gravity is mathematically equivalent to a scalar version of the con-
formal invariant weyl theory [2, 3, 4] with the scalar  as the measure of integrable change
of the length of a vector in its parallel transport. however, the einstein theory and the weyl
one correspond to dierent conventions about the measurable interval. the einstein conven-
tion with the measurable (proper) time dtf = dt (/) leads to the frw cosmological picture
with the expanding universe, while, the conformal invariant measurable time (t ) leads to the
hoyle-narlikar cosmology where the reason of the red shift is alteration of masses of particles
formed by the higgs-weyl scalar eld  and the conformal invariant size of the universe is an
integral of motion.

three dierent times of hamiltonian reduction correspond to three dierent energies:

 constraint (for coordinate time),
 evolution momentum p0 (for evolution parameter),
 measurable energy (for measurable time)

em = 

dw r
dt

.

(12)

all these energies depend on the invariant times (, t ).
the problem is to nd integrals of motion of the considered time-reparametrization

system, and describe creation of particles in the evolution of the universe.

3 the bogolyubov transformation

we dene particle-like variables as the holomorphic representations of the standard variables
[10]

q(t) =

(a+(t) + a(t)) ; p(t) = ir 

2

(a+(t)  a(t)).

(13)

(14)

(15)

there is the quantum eld theory convention that we measure the number of particles

na(t) = {a+(t)a(t)} 
in the considered case this quantity is not conserved

(a+a + aa+).

in particular, just this quantity forms the observable density  and evolution of the universe

(16)

the main goal of our paper is to show that there are the bogolyubov transformations of the
particle variables

b+ = a+ +  a,

b = a + a+,

(17)

which diagonalize the corresponding classical equations expressed in terms of particles (a+, a),
so that the number of quasiparticles is conserved

in terms of the particle variables (13) the action (1) has the form

4 creation of particles

as  has left the phase space to convert into the internal evolution parameter, in quantum
theory, we can quantize only the particle sector

[a, a+] = 1 ;

[b, b+] = 1

(36)

in the following, we restrict ourselves by the universe in the state of vacuum of quasiparticles :

b < 0|b+b|0 >b= 0 ; < 0|{a+a}|0 >=

we can see that there can be the period of ination-like evolution of the scale factor in gr, or
the higgs eld in conformal unied theory [2, 3, 4], with respect to the conformal world time
(measurable in cut).

5 conclusion

the conceptions of particle and quasiparticle were considered in constrained systems with
the time-reparametrization invariance. the main peculiarity of such systems is the internal
evolution parameter as one of variables of the extended phase space. after the hamiltonian re-
duction all equations of motion of the constrained system are converted into the reparametriza-
tion invariant equations for variables in the reduced phase space with respect to the evolution
parameter. relativistic systems are dened also the proper (measurable) time of an observer
in a comoving frame of reference. the dependence of the measurable time on the internal
evolution parameter determines the universe evolution law in the form of the red shift or the
hubble parameter.

accordingly, there are two dierent energies: the evolution energy (as the momentum with
negative contribution to the energy constraint) and the measurable energy as the variation of
the reduced action with respect to the measurable time with negative sign.

we dene particles as variables in the holomorphic representation which diagonalizes the
evolution energy. just this energy forms the observable hubble parameter. therefore, these
particles can be treated as observable ones. as a number of particles is not conserved, we
construct the bogolyubov quasiparticles which digonalize the equations of motion. a number of
quasiparticles is conserved, and they are required to nd a set of integrals of motion to describe
the measurable time in the parametric form depending on initial data.

these denitions strongly dier from the conventional approach [6, 7, 8, 9] which goes from
the conserved particles as initial data to unconserved quasiparticles with diagonalization
only of the hamiltonian.
