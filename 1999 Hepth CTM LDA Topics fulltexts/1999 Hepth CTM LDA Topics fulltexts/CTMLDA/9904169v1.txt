using a sigma model formulation of the eld equations as on a two-dimensional manifold we
provide the proof of a black hole uniqueness solutions in n = 4, d = 4 supergravity subject to
certain boundary conditions. we considered the black hole solutions both in su (4) and so(4)
versions of the underlying theory.

i. introduction

during the last years there has been a considerable resurgance of mathematical studies of topics related to the

black hole equilibrium states. not only restricted to the pure vacuum einstein or einstein-maxwell theory but also

including nonlinear matter models, general sigma models or elds occuring in the low energy limits of the superstring

theories.

in his pioneering investigations [1,2] israel established the uniqueness of the schwarzschild metric and its reissner-

nordstrom generalization as static asymptotically at solutions of the einstein and einstein-maxwell vacuum eld

equations subject to the condition of regularity outside a well behaved ergosurface where the static killing vector

becomes null. in view of the subsequent demonstration [3,4] that in the static case (though not more generally) the

ergosurface will be an event horizon, it follows that the schwarzschild and reissner-nordstrom solutions are the only

einstein or einstein-maxwell (non-extreme) solutions that satisfy the condition of being static black hole metrics in

the strict modern sense of the term.

israels article [1] was the foundation of the next works of muller zum hagen et al. [5] and robinson [6] establishing

the generalization of israels theorem of the uniqueness of the schwarzschild black hole solution.

the uniqueness results for rotating congurations, i.e., for stationary and axisymmetric black hole spacetimes were

achieved by carter in [7] and completed by hawking and ellis [26] and the next works of carter [4,9], robinson [10]

and wald [11]. these works were devoted to the vacuum case. bunting [12] and mazur [13] generalize these results

to the electromagnetic case. buntings approach was based on using a general class of harmonic mappinng between

riemannian manifolds. in mazurs proof the key point was the observation that the ernst eqs. described a nonlinear

sigma model on a symmetric space. the review of the new methods presented by bunting and mazur was discussed

in [14].

bunting and masood-ul-alam [15] used the positive mass theorem [16,17] to prove the uniqueness, the spherical

symmetry or the nonexistence for several static black hole solutions of the einsteins eqs.

in ref. [15] the afore

mentioned technique was explored to prove the nonexistence of multiple black holes in the asymptotically euclidean

static vacuum spacetime. they found the conformal transformation which caused that the mass of the spatial part of

1

the metric was equal to zero, but the scalar curvature tensor was non-negative. ruback [18] applied this technique to

prove the uniqueness theorem for charged black holes in static einstein-maxwell spacetime. masood-ul-alam [19] gave

an alternative, much simpler, a rigorous proof that the unique non-degenerate electrovac static black hole metrics are

the reissner-nordstrom family. it was done without assuming the connectedness of the event horizon. the further

generalization of the uniqueness proof for the static electrovac black holes including the case of a non-vanishing

magnetic charge was proposed by heusler [20]. he used a generalization of the conformal factor and established the

nonexistence of multiple black hole solutions of einstein-maxwell system with electric and magnetic elds in a static,

asymptotically at spacetime. heusler [21] demonstrated also the uniqueness of multiple black hole solutions for any

self-coupled, stationary scalar mapping (sigma-model) with nonrotating horizon.

using the fact that einstein-abelian gauge eld eqs. can be formulated as a sigma model on the adequate kahler
manifold, gurses [22] found that (n  1) abelian gauge charged kerr black hole is a unique stationary black hole
solution of einstein-abelian gauge eld eqs. in ref. [23], he also proved that, the boundary value problems of some

sigma models in a non-riemannian background have unique solutions.

quite recently a uniqueness theorem was extended to the case of the ernst solution and c-metric [24].

uniqueness theorems for black holes are closely related to the problem of staticity. lichnerowicz [25] was the rst

who considered the idea of staticity for a stationary perfect uid, locally static in the sence that its ow vector

was connected with the killing vector. the next extensions was atributed to hawking [26] (vacuum case) and the

hawkings strong rigidity theorem [8] emphasized that the event horizon of a stationary black hole had to be a killing

horizon. recently, sudarsky and wald [27], by means of the notion of an asymptotically at maximal slice with

a compact interior, obtained the conditions that the solution of einstein-yang-mills eqs.

is static when it had a

vanishing yang-mills electric eld on static hypersurfaces. they also reached to the conclusion that nonrotating

einstein-maxwell black hole must be static when it has a vanishing magnetic eld on static slices [28].

for a recent review concerning various aspects of uniqueness theorems for nonrotating and rotating black holes see

[29], while the mathematical rigor of the afore mentioned problems has been studied in the review articles provided

by chrusciel [30,31].

recently, there has been an active period for constructing black hole solutions in the string theory which seems the

most promising for a theory of quantum gravity (see [32] for a recent review of the subject).

the uniqueness of static, charged dilaton black hole solutions in the low energy string theory was certied by

masood-ul-alam [33]. he found a conformal spatial metric which had the sucient properties for existing suitable

dirac spinors. by means of the lichnerowicz eq. it was shown that these spinors are constant.

the alternative proof of a uniqueness of a static charged dilaton black hole was provided by gurses and sermutlu

[34]. they used a sigma model formulation of equations of motion. the problem of black hole solutions and their

uniqueness in axion-dilaton gravity was studied by bowick et al. [35]. they managed to nd uniqueness theorem in

the case of the minimal coupling of axion eld to gravity. cambell et al. [36] showed the existence of axion hair for a

kerr black hole and calculated it explicitily in the case of a slow motion. they considered axion elds with a lorentz

chern-simons coupling to gravity. a dilaton coupling to axion elds strengths were considered in [37], where the

authors calculated dilaton hair arising from the specic axion source.

2

wells [38] wrote down the analogue of the robinsons identity for dilatonic black holes which allowed him to prove

uniqueness theorem for a class of accelerating stringy black holes.

the problem of staticity theorems in einstein-maxwell axion-dilaton gravity was studied by rogatko in ref. [39],

where the modied carter arguments were used to nd staticity conditions for elds and the metric. it was found, in

ref. [40], that static black hole solutions in the above theory had vanishing electric and axion-electric elds on static

slices.

our paper is organized as follows. in sec.ii we present the equations of motion for the bosonic sector of n = 4, d = 4

supergravity in a static axially symmetric spacetime. introducing the adequate forms of the pseudopotentials and

complex scalars enables us to write eqs. of motion as two complex ernst-like eqs. then, using the matrix formulation

of ernst eqs., conceived by gurses and xanthopoulos [41], we reached the conclusion that two metrics satisfying the

eqs. of motion and having the same boundary conditions must be equal to each other in all points of the region of

the two-dimensional manifold. which implies in turns, that all black hole solutions in the theory under consideration

subject to the same boundary conditions are the same everywhere in the spacetime. we considered the su (4) and

so(4) versions of the underlying theory. we conclude in sec.iii with a brief summary of our researches and their

implications.

ii. uniqueness of black hole solutions

a. doubly charged black holes in su (4) version of n = 4, d = 4 supergravity

superstring theories provide interesting generalizations of the einstein-maxwell theory in the so-called low energy

limit. a dimensionally reduced superstring theory can be described in terms of n = 4, d = 4 supergravity. it turned

out, that one can refer to the so(4) version [42] or su (4) one [43]. in our paper, we shall consider bosonic sectors of

these theories, taking into account two u (1) gauge elds and a dilaton eld , called u (1)2 theories. we begin with

the su (4) version of n = 4, d = 4 supergravity, which the action is of the form [42,44]

isu(4) = z d4xg(cid:2)r  2()2  e2(cid:0)ff  + gg(cid:1)(cid:3) ,

(1)

where the strengths of the gauge elds are descibed by f = 2[a] and g = 2[b]. the resulting equations
of motion, derived from the variational principle, are as follows:

r = e2(cid:18)2ff

(cid:0)e2g(cid:1) = 0.

(5)

the black hole solutions in the theory under consideration were widely discussed by kallosh et al. in ref. [44].

our main task will be to prove the uniqueness of the obtained results. we want to provide some continuity with

the researches of gurses [23,34], in some respects to generalize them, we shall present our analysis of the problem in a

3

form and notation similar to theirs. first, we shall formulate the corresponding eqs. of motion as a two-dimensional

sigma model and prove the uniqueness of the static solution under the same boundary conditions. in order to do so

we introduce the static axially symmetric line element expressed as

ds2 = e2dt2 + e2 (cid:2)e2 (cid:0)dr2 + dz2(cid:1) + r2d2(cid:3) ,

(6)

where  and  depended only on r and z coordinates. the components of the u (1) gauge strength tensors will be in

the direction of time f = (a0, 0, 0, 0) and in the azimuthal angle g = (0, 0, 0, b). in our further considerations

we assume that the components of the u (1) gauge elds are functions of r and z. then, the resulting eqs. of motion

are as follows:

2  e22(cid:0)a2

0,r + a2

0,z(cid:1) +

where 2 is the laplacian operator in the (r, z) coordinates, namely, 2 = 2
from eq.(11) or (12) one can determine the function  if , , a0, b are known. hence, the essential part of the

eqs. of motion consists of eqs.(7-10).

now, let us dene the quantities

and

e =   ,

m =   ,

a0 =

a02

,

b =

ib2

.

consistently with the above denitions, eqs.(7-10) can be rewritten in the forms

2e + e2e a0 a0 = 0,

2 a0 + 2e a0 = 0,

2m + e2m b b = 0,

4

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

 b + 2m b = 0.

thus, we obtain two pairs of eqs., one described in terms of a0, e and the other for b and m .

we observe that eq.(16) allows us to dene a pseudopotential (a), given by

(a)r = re2e a0,z,

(a)z = re2e a0,r,

while from eq.(18), one can establish the following (b) pseudopotential:

(b)r = e2m b,z

r

,

(b)z =

e2m b,r

r

.

(18)

(19)

(20)

then, we want to rewrite the eqs.(15-18) in the forms similar to the ernst ones. in order to do this, we introduce

two complex scalars, determined by

1 = ree + i(a),

2 = em + i(b).

now, eqs.(15-16) and (17-18) can be arranged into the following two complex eqs.:

(1 + 1)21 = 211,
(2 + 2)22 = 222,

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

where a bar denotes complex conjugation.

eqs.(23) and (24) are two ernst eqs., which each of them combine in a convenient and a symmetric fashion the two

eqs. governing ,  and the adequate gauge eld. each of them dened a sigma model on su (2)/u (1).

it was shown in ref. [41], that the various combinations of ernsts eqs. were included in the single matrix eq. in our

case, the matrix eq. is determined by

where the subscript (i) in p matrix refers respectively to a, b gauge elds. the explicit form of the matrices are

rhp 1

(i) rp(i)i + z hp 1

(i) zp(i)i = 0,

(25)

given by

p(a) =

1

ree (cid:18) 1

(a)

(a)

r2e2e + 2

(a)(cid:19) ,

p(b) =

1

em (cid:18) 1

(b)

(b)

e2m + 2

(b)(cid:19) .

(26)

one can check that, the above matrix eqs. when written out explicitly in terms of its elements constitute four eqs.,

all of them are various combinations of eqs. (23-24) and eqs. the complex conjugate of them.

in order to prove a uniqueness theorem we shall follow the line described by gurses [23]. to begin with, one should
assume enough dierentiability for the matrices components in a region d of the two-dimensional manifold m with
boundary d. let p(i)1 and p(i)2 will be two dierent solutions of eqs. (25) respectively for the cases of a and b
gauge elds, than the dierence of their eqs. will have be given by

(cid:16)p 1

(i)1(cid:0)q(i)(cid:1) p(i)2(cid:17) = 0,

5

(27)

where q(i) = p(i)1p 1

(i)2. multiplying eq.(27) by q

(i), one arives at the expression

2q(i) = t rh(cid:16)q

(i)(cid:17) p 1

(i)1(cid:0)q(i)(cid:1) p(i)2i ,

(28)

where q = t rq. taking into account hermicity and positive deniteness of the matrices p(i)1 and p(i)2, we can

postulate the form of the above matrices, satisfying

where  = 1, 2. the explicit forms of the matrices a and b can be established as follows:

p(a) = aa
,

p(b) = bb
,

a =

1

ree/2 (cid:18) 1

(a)

0

ree (cid:19) ,

b =

1

em/2 (cid:18) 1

(b)

0

em (cid:19) .

using relation (29) one can rewrite eq.(28) in the form

where j(a) = a1

1 (q(a))a2 and j(b) = b1

2q(i) = t r(cid:16)j 
1 (q(b))b2. thus, the explicit versions of q(i) are given by

(i)j(i)(cid:17) ,

q(a) = 2 +

q(b) = 2 +

1

r2ee1+e2 h(cid:0)(a)1  (a)2(cid:1)2
em1+m2 h(cid:0)(b)1  (b)2(cid:1)2

+ r2(cid:0)ee1  ee2(cid:1)2i ,
+(cid:0)em1  em2(cid:1)2i .

1

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

it is evident that on the boundary q(a) = q(b) = 2 and their rst derivatives disappear there. taking into account
the boundary conditions on d, one can integrate eq.(31) to obtain the relation

zd

t r(cid:16)j 

(i)j(i)(cid:17) = 0.

(34)

the expression (34) implies vanishing of j(a) and j(b), which in turns causes that q(i) = const in all region d.
because of this fact, q(i) = i matrix on d, then q(i) = i in d. therefore we reach to the conclusion that,
p(i)1 = p(i)2 at all points of the region d of the two-dimensional manifold m.

as was mentioned in ref. [34], the other way of reaching these conclusions is to observe that, vanishing of (34)
implies the harmonicity of q in d region. since q(i) = 2 on the boundary d, then it must be equal to the same
constant value in the region d. thus, p(i)1 = p(i)2 in d.
the above considerations enables us to formulate the main result, the following.
theorem: consider a two-dimensional manifold m equipped with a local coordinates (r, z). suppose that, d is a region
in m with boundary d. let p(i) be hermitian, positive denite two-dimensional matrices with unit determinants,
respectively for i = a, b gauge elds. suppose further that, matrices p(i)1 and p(i)2 satisfy eq.(27), namely

(cid:16)p 1

(i)1(cid:0)q(i)(cid:1) p(i)2(cid:17) = 0,

(35)

in the region d and have the same boundary conditions on d. then, in all points of the region d, one has that
p(i)1 = p(i)2.

the doubly charged dilaton black holes in su (4) version of n = 4, d = 4 supergravity are characterized by mass

m , the f -eld electric charge, the g-eld magnetic charge and the dilaton charge . the above theorem envisages

that all black holes subject to the same boundary conditions, as the solution obtained by kallosh et al. in ref. [44],

are the same everywhere in the spacetime.

6

b. doubly charged black holes in so(4) version of n = 4, d = 4 supergravity

the bosonic part of the so(4) version of n = 4 supergravity in four dimensions can be described by the action

[42,44]

iso(4) = z d4xghr  2()2 (cid:16)e2ff  + e2 g g(cid:17)i ,

(36)

where the strengthes of the gauge elds are descibed by f = 2[a] and g = 2[g]. the equations derived
from the variational principle are as follows:

r = e2(cid:18)2ff

 

1

(cid:0)e2f (cid:1) = 0,
(cid:16)e2 g(cid:17) = 0.

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

the components of the u (1) gauge elds are in the time direction [44], namely f = (a0, 0, 0, 0) and g =

(g0, 0, 0, 0). as in the proceding paragraph the components of the u (1) gauge elds are functions depending only on

(r, z) coordinates. the eqs. of motion in metric (6) satisfy

thus, with the substitution

and

e =   ,

n =   ,

a0 =

a02

,

g0 =

g02

,

we nd that, eqs. of motion can be rewritten as follows:

(48)

2e + e2e a0 a0 = 0,
2 a0 + 2e a0 = 0,
2n + e2n g0 g0 = 0,
2 g0 + 2n g0 = 0.

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

now, the pseudopotentials for gauge elds a and g have the same form as in eq.(19), where one should substitute the

adequate values of e, (n ) and derivatives of the gauge elds under consideration. then, using eq.(21) to introduce

the complex scalars, enables to rewrite the system of eqs.(49-52) as the decoupled two ernsts like eqs. then, the

proof follows the same line as that of the proceding subsection. finally one can reach the conclusion, that all points
of the region d equipped with the boundary d on two-dimensional manifold m, p(i)1 = p(i)2.
in view of the foregoing uniqueness theorem, we conclude that all doubly charged black hole solutions characterized

by mass m , the f -eld electric charge, the g-eld electric charge and the dilaton charge , with the same boundary

conditions as found in ref. [44] are the same everywhere in the spacetime.

iii. conclusions

in our work we were studying the doubly charged dilaton black holes in the bosonic sector of n = 4, d = 4

supergravity, being the low energy limit of the superstring theories. we were interested in the uniqueness of these

solutions. using the method proposed in ref. [23] and nding the adequate forms of pseudopotentials and complex

scalars for su (4) and so(4) versions of the theory, we were able to nd that eqs. of motion could be arranged in

the two ernsts eqs. for each of the gauge elds appearing in the theory. these eqs. give the ernsts formulation of

the generalized einstein eqs. for the bosonic sector of n = 4, d = 4 supergravity. then, using the idea of gurses and

xantopoulous [41] that ernst eqs. are included in the single matrix eq., we prove the uniqueness of the previously

[44] obtained black hole solutions.

it will be interesting to nd the exact form of the ernst eqs. for more complicated version of the low energy string

theory, for instance einstein-maxwell axion-dilaton gravity or n = 8 black holes now intensively studied [45]. we

hope to return to these problems elsewhere.
