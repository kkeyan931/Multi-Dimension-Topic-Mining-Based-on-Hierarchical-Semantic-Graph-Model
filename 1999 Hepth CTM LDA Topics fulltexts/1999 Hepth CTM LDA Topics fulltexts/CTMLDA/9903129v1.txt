abstract

examples of stable, non-bps m-theory membrane conguration are constructed via m(atrix)
theory. the stable membranes are localized on o4 or o8 orientifolds, which project chan-
paton gauge bundle of m(atrix) zero-brane partons to usp-type. the examples are shown to
be consistent with predictions based on k-theory analysis.

introduction

at present, m(atrix) theory [1] is the only known nonperturbative, partonic denition of m-

theory, which unies all perturbative superstring theories. for example, it has been found

that the m(atrix) theory captures successfully the dynamics of supergraviton, compactication

on lower-dimensional space with or without orbifolds/orientifolds, and identication of twisted

states thereof. in particular, the theory were able to encompass all known bps states in string

and m-theories.

in this paper, we point out that m(atrix) theory is also able to encompass stable but non-

bps states as well. we will be illustrating this in the simplest context, namely, membrane

(m2) in the presence of z2 orientifold planes, especially, for congurations in which they are
parallel each other. in this case, two types of orientifold o are possible, projecting onto so
or usp chan-paton gauge bundles 2 for the zero-brane partons.

in m(atrix) theory, the m2 on an z2 orientifold is described in covering space as a pair

of m2 and m2 conguration, thus breaking all the supersymmetries completely (unless the

membrane is on top of the orientifold). this is signalled, among others, by the presence of a

tachyonic mode in the uctuation spectrum around the m2 and m2 conguration. among the

uctuations, only those compatible with the orientifold will survive. we will thus investigate

under what orientifold choices the tachyonic mode might be removed out of the uctuation

spectrum. by exploiting projection conditions of the chan-paton indices, we will be showing
that the m2 on an o4+ or o8+ orientifold is a stable, non-bps conguration.

recently, there has been progress in classifying stable non-bps states in string theory [2]-

[11]. generic non-bps states are aicted with tachyon modes, which leads to an instability

for the states to decay or annihilate. as shown armatively by sen [2], the tachyon conden-

sation (with or without orientifolds) leads to plethora of bps and (stable) non-bps d-branes,

thus shed new light on the identication of ramond-ramond charges. moreover, witten [6]

has shown that possible stable ramond-ramond charge conguration formed out of tachyon

condensation is most suitably classied in terms of k-theory. for example, type i theory is
equipped with o9 and it allows non-bps d(-1), d0, d7 and d8-branes which can carry z2

charges, in addition to the well-known supersymmetric d1, d5 and d9 branes. it has been also
found that non-bps d3 and d4 branes exist as localized states in o5+ plane. d3-branes corre-
spond to (unwrapped) d2-branes in type iia string theory and, due to bott periodicity, o9+

2in this paper, we will be denoting orientifold p-planes with so (usp) chan-paton gauge bundles as op

(op+) planes.

will also allow non-bps d3-branes. from these results, one would then anticipate existence of
a stable, non-bps m2 conguration located on o4+ or o8+ orientifold with usp chan-paton

gauge bundle. the present work may then be regarded as a natural extension of these results

within string theory to m-theory dened via m(atrix) theory.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we will briey recapitulate the dynamics of

a pair of m2 - m2 in m(atrix) theory. we will extend the method developed by aharony and

berkooz [12], from which the presence of tachyon mode and orientifold projection thereof can

be formulated in the most transparent way. in section 3, we will recapitulate the denition of

the orientifold in m(atrix) theory and the rule of orientifold projection to uctuation spectrum.
in section 4, we will study m2 on o8 orientifold with particular attention to the fate of

tachyon mode and, using the orientifold projection rules presented in section 3, show that
o8+ orientifold projects out the tachyon mode and hence lead to a stable, non-bps state.
in section 5, we will study m2 on o4 orientifold and draw the same conclusion that o4+

orientifold projects out the tachyon mode. in section 6, we will conclude with a brief discussion
on comparison with k-theoretic analysis, where the m2 on o4+ or o8+ orientifolds is known

to be a stable, non-bps state with z2 charges.

2 m2 - m2 dynamics

we will begin with, in m(atrix) theory, dynamics of m2 - m2 conguration drawing particular

attention to the tachyonic instability. in fact, the dynamics has been studied by aharony and

berkooz [12]. in this section,we will repeat essential part of their analysis relevant for foregoing

discussions, but in a more transparent notation. the m(atrix) theory is a nonperturbative

denition of the m-theory, whose action is given by

s = z dt tr(cid:20) 1

[x i, x j]2 + t dt + it i[x i, ](cid:21) .
here, x i, a are adjoint representations of gauge group u(n), and dt = t  i[a0,
covariant derivative. in m(atrix) theory, a conguration of m2 - m2 , separated by a distance

(dtx i)2 +

and all other x is and as vanishing. here, q, q, p, p are (n  n) submatrices obeying
[q, p ] = [ q, p ] = ic1, c = o(1/n).
it is straightforward to check that eq.(2) solves the
equations of motion derived from the action, eq.(1).

as eq.(2) breaks all supersymmetries spontaneously, there will be corrections to the total

energy of m2 - m2 conguration. at leading order, the correction gives rise to a static, inter-

brane potential, which can be extracted by applying the born-oppenheimer approximation 

integrate out small uctuations around the conguration, eq.(2). for the born-oppenheimer

approximation, relevant parts of uctuations are from o-diagonal submatrices:

x i = x i

mm +(cid:18) 0
y i

y i

0 (cid:19) ;

a = (cid:18) 0

ta

a

0 (cid:19) .

(3)

expanding the potential energy parts in eq.(1) up to quadratic order in z  (y i, a), one
obtains various terms of the form tr(z 
ao1zbo2), where o1,2 are generic functions of classical
conguration, eq.(2), viz. of q, q, p, p and r. taking adjoint basis for the uctuations, za,bs,

one can represent these terms compactly as

tr(z 

2 )zb.

ao1zbo2) = z 
 z

a(o1  1 + 1  ot

among the quadratic terms, the bosonic uctuations y3,   , y8 are in a diagonal form:

q = q  1  1  qt
p = p  1 + 1  p t.

(5)

consistent with [q, p ] = [q, p ] = ic1, it is always possible to take a realization taking q, q

as symmetric matrices and p, p as antisymmetric ones, so that

q = q  1  1  q
p = p  1  1  p .

(6)

one thus nds that eq.(4) can be interpreted as a quantum mechanical system of two-

particles connected by a spring, where coordinates and conjugate momenta operators of the

two-particles are q, q and p, p , respectively. moreover, the uctuation matrices ymns are

interpreted as wave functions, where q, p s and q, p s act on the chan-paton index m and

n, respectively. thus, ymns are two-body wave functions in which the rst and the second

particles are in m-th and n-th excited states. moreover, eq.(6) exhibits clearly that degrees

3

of freedom associated with the center of mass of the analog system consisting of two particles

decouple completely, as physically ought to be the case.

using the commutation relation, [q,p] = 2ic1, one obtains the uctuation spectrum of

y3,   , y8 as

m 2

(n; r) = r2 + 2c(2n + 1),

(n = 0, 1, 2,  ).

for the bosonic uctuations y1,2,9, the quadratic part is coupled one another:

1 , y 

2 , y 

9 )

pq + 2ic

diagonalizing eq.(8), one obtains, in addition to a zero-mode, two uctuation spectrum

m 2

m 2

||(n; r) = r2 + 2c(2n  1)
||+(n; r) = r2 + 2c(2n + 3)

(n = 0, 1, 2,  ).

(7)

(8)

(9)

an important point to be noted for later discussion is that, upon diagonalizing the matrix,

eq.(8), the n-th harmonic oscillator eigenstate of y9 is always accompanied by a linear combi-
nation of the (n + 1)-th and the (n 1)-th eigenstates of y1,2s. thus, y1, y2 are even functions
when y9 is an odd one, and vice versa.

for fermionic coordinates, the same interpretation as the above goes through (except that
the wave functions a are grassmannian) and the uctuation spectrum is grouped into a pair,
a consequence following from the fact that as are projected by  = 12 for each membrane

conguration. half of them are

m 2

f(n; r) = r2 + 2c(2n)

(n = 0, 1, 2,  )

m 2

f+(n; r) = r2 + 2c(2n + 2) ,

(n = 0, 1, 2,  )

(10)

(11)

and the others are

respectively.

now, the potential between membrane and anti-membrane arises from summing over zero

point uctuation energies, viz. graded sum of the bosonic and fermionic mass spectra obtained

above:

4qr2 + 2c(2m  2)  4qr2 + 2c(2m)(cid:19) .

4

(12)

this yields the static interaction potential between m2 and m2 . evidently, when the m2 and
m2 approaches close, viz. r < 2c, the interaction develops a complex-valued potential energy,
a signal of tachyonic instability. note that the tachyon mode arises from the lowest eigenvalue

of y1, y2 uctuation, see eq.(9).

3 m(atrix) orientifolds

in m(atrix) theory, orientifolds are dened as quotient condition on x i, a, the moduli space

variables parametrizing transverse spacetime in the discrete light-cone description. to be spe-
cic, we will be considering a spacetime of the form rp,1  m9p/, where m 9p is a smooth
manifold and  = z2 is a discrete symmetry group acting on m9p.

3.1 m(atrix) z2 orientifolds

the m(atrix) orientifold op is dened as a quotient condition on covering space variables of

chan-paton gauge bundle u(2n):

x|| = +mx||
x = mx
a =  ma

(rp, 1
(m9p

coordinates)

coordinates)

tm 1

tm 1

tm 1,

(13)

here,  = 9p10p    9 is the product of dirac gamma matrices of m9p. consistency
of the quotient condition restricts possible types of the matrix m [14]. one then obtains, for
a symmetric choice of m = 1  1, the projected chan-paton bundle is so(2n), while, for
an antisymmetric choice of m = 1  2, the projected bundle is usp(2n). in what follows,
we will denote m(atrix) orientifold with so or usp projections as op or op+, respectively.
the variables x and half of as belong to adjoint representation of the respective chan-
paton gauge bundle. the variables x|| and the other half of as transform as symmetric
(antisymmetric) tensor representation under the so (usp) gauge bundles, respectively. note
that, for s1/z2, t5/z2 and t9/z2 compactications, a consistent choice of the orientifold
projection was found to be o8 [13, 14, 15], o4+ [16, 17], and o0 [18, 19], respectively 3.

3our classication of m(atrix) orientifolds is slightly dierent from those used, for example, in [6, 8, 9]. in
our notation, the chan-paton gauge bundles refer to m(atrix) zero-brane partons on orientifolds. in m(atrix)
theory, this notation provides a more convenient bookeeping.

5

3.2 rules of orientifold projection

consider, near an orientifold (of transverse distance r/2 away), placing an m2 parallel to

the orientifold plane. in covering space, the conguration corresponds to an m2 - m2 pair,

separated by a distance r.

after orientifolding, the o-diagonal submatrices of x i, as in eq.(13) will become symmet-

ric or antisymmetric, depending on the choice of chan-paton gauge bundles. this is because,
in covering space description, uctuation modes of x i, as that are not consistent with ori-
entifold condition will be projected out [14]. for op, it turns out y||s are symmetric, while
ys are antisymmetric. for op+, it is the opposite, viz. y||s are antisymmetric, whlie ys are
symmetric. for as,  eigenstates of  are symmetric and antisymmetric, respectively.

in analyzing the uctuation spectrum, we have interpreted y i, as as quantum-mechanical

wave functions of an analog sytem, which consists of two particles connected by a spring.

orientifold operation takes a transpose of each matrices, see eq.(13). as the chan-paton indices

ymn, mn are interpreted as that the rst harmonic oscillator is in m-th excited state and the

second in n-th excited state, under orientifold operation, the sign of relative coordinates between

the two harmonic oscillators gets reversed. this implies that, in symmetric submatrices, only
even modes (n = 0, 2, 4,  ) will survive, while, in antisymmetric submatrices, only odd modes
(n = 1, 3, 5,  ) will do so.

thus, projection rules of m(atrix) orientifold would be that, for op orientifold correspond-

ing to so chan-paton gauge bundle, even modes of y|| and odd modes of y will only survive.
for as, half of even modes and half of odd modes will survive. for op+ orientifold corre-

sponding to usp chan-paton gauge bundle, odd modes of y|| and even modes of y will only
survive. for as, again, half of even modes and half of odd modes will survive.

using orientifold projection rules stated as above, we will now analyze m2 on o8 and

m2 on o4 congurations in detail.

4 m2 on m(atrix) o8-orientifold

utilizing the uctuation spectrum of m2 - m2 analyzed in section 2, we will now examine

stability of m2 located near an o8-orientifold in m(atrix) theory.

6

4.1 m2 conguratoin near o8-orientifold

we will be taking o8-orientifold spans r8,1 = (t, x 1,   , x 8). the m2 is then located at
a distance r/2 along x 9, the coordinate of m/z2, and extended along (x 1, x 2) directions.
from the supersymmetry transformation rules, one nds easily that the m2 -o8 conguration

breaks all the supersymmetries of the m(atrix) theory.

we will now analyze the stability for o8-orientifold projections explicitly. this amounts

to examining fate of the (complex-valued) tachyon mode, the diagonal linear combination of
y 1, y 2 in eq.(8), under the orientifold projection.

4.2 m2 on o8 orientifold

for o8 orientifold corresponding to so chan-paton gauge bundle, from the above projection

rules, one only keeps even modes of eq.(7) and eq.(8) , and even and odd modes separately

for eqs.(10,11).

stability of the m2 conguration may be examined, for example, from the static potential

when the m2 is located o the o8 orientifold at a distance r/2:

vso(r) =



xm=1(cid:18)qr2 + 2c(4m  5) +qr2 + 2c(4m  1) + 6qr2 + 2c(4m  3)
2qr2 + 2c(4m  4)  4qr2 + 2c(4m  2)  2qr2 + 2c(4m)(cid:19) .

(14)

terms in the rst line are contribution of even modes of y 1, y 2, which will automatically
projects into odd modes of y 9 at the same time, and of even modes of y 3,   , y 8. likewise,
those in the second line are contributions from even and odd modes of (1 )a, respectively.
at short distance, r  0, the potential, eq.(14), is complex-valued, as seen from the
m = 0 contribution of the rst term in the summand. this signals a tachyonic instability of the
m2 located near the o8-orientifold. to explore r   long distance behavior, it is convenient
to reexpress the potential, eq.(14), into an integral representation, using the identity:

a = 

1

s3/2 eas.

one nds

vso(r) = 4r

(15)

(16)

.

expanding the integrand for small s, which is a convergent expansion in the limit under consid-
eration, one obtains a long-distance behavior of the static potential for the m2 -o8 orientifold

conguration:

vso(r) = +4r 

3c3

4r5 + o(cid:18) 1

r7(cid:19) ,

(r  ).

(17)

the potential is attractive. we thus conclude that, near an o8 orientifold, the m2 is attracted

to the orientifold plane and eventually becomes a tachyonic conguration.

4.3 m2 on o8+ orientifold

we next turn to o8+ orientifold corresponding to usp chan-paton gauge bundle. according

to the projection rules, one now need to keep odd modes of eq.(7) and eq.(9), and even and

odd modes of eqs.(10,11), respectively.

again, we will infer the stability of m2 conguration conveniently by locating it at a dis-

tance r/2 o the orientifold and measure the static potential:

vusp(r) =



xm=1(cid:18)qr2 + 2c(4m  3) +qr2 + 2c(4m + 1) + 6qr2 + 2c(4m  1)
2qr2 + 2c(4m)  4qr2 + 2c(4m  2)  2qr2 + 2c(4m  4)(cid:19) .

(18)

most signicantly, one notes that the tachyon mode of eq.(9) (the n = 0 mode of m 2
||) is
completely projected out in the background of o8+-orientifold. the static potential of m2 is
then well-dened for r  0.

at long distance, r  , using the integral representation, one nds:
s3/2 er2se2cs sinh4(cs)

vusp(r) = 4r 

sinh(4cs)

ds

.

4

 z

(19)

(20)

expanding the integran for small s, one obtains:

vusp(r) = 4r 

3c3
4r5 + o(

1
r7 ) ,

indicating a repulsive long-range force. thus, we conclude that the m2 near an o8+-orientifold

exhibits a stable but non-bps conguration.

4.4 compact m1/z2 orientifolds and twisted sector states

in our discussion so far, we have implicitly assumed that the covering space m of the orientifold
is noncompact. if m is compact, say, m = s1/z2, then in order to cancel anomalous uxes
carried by the orientifolds, one needs to introduce a twisted sector in the m(atrix) theory. for

s1/z2, t5/z2 and t9/z2 cases, complete spectrum of the twisted sector has been determined

8

previously [14, 16, 18]. one may inquire if the conclusion in the previous subsections on non-
bps m2 on m(atrix) orientifolds would be modied in case the covering space m is compact,
viz. if the eects of twisted sector spectrum is included.

for s1/z2, consistency condition of anomalous ux and gauge anomaly cancellations xes

uniquely that the two orientifolds (located at two diagonal points on the s1 covering space)
are o8 ones and that the twisted sector consists of eight supersymmetry singlet fermions on

each orientifold. the twisted sector fermions, which transform as fundamental representation
under the so(2n) chan-paton gauge bundle and couples only to x 9 minimally.
inferring
x 9 from eq.(2), for all twisted sector fermions, uctuation energy spectrum will then be r/2,
independent of the analog harmonic oscillator excitation level n 4.

the o-diagonal y i, as submatrices in the untwisted sector has (n n) degrees of freedom
overall. however, for each uctuation mode, there are n-fold degeneracy, corresponding to

the center of mass motion of the analog two-particle harmonic oscillator system. projecting
these degeneracy out, uctuation energy spectrum of y i, as have eectively n-fold degeneracy

only. the twisted sector fermions belong to fundamental representation of the chan-paton

gauge bundle, so their uctuation energy spectrum is n-fold degenerate, the same as that of
untwisted sector. this implies that the leading-order, linear potential for m2 on o8, eq.(16),

is cancelled exactly by the contribution of twisted sector fermions, resulting in an attractive

long-range potential.

another possibility is that the two orientifolds at s1/z2 xed points are o8 and o8+ type

ones, respectively. in this case, as the anomalous ux from each orientifold cancels each other,

there is no need to introduce a twisted sector. in this case, m2 appears a stable state locally
near o8+ orientifold, but as it is transported near to o8 orientifold, m2 ought to exhibit

tachyonic instability. thus, in this case, stability of m2 would depend, in a complicated way,
both on the volume of s1/z2 (viz. distance between o8+ and o8) and on location r/2 of the

m2 .

4.5

summary

m2 is a stable, non-bps conguration when located on o8+ orientifold, but exhibit tachyonic
instability when located on o8 orientifold.

4 if each twisted sector fermion is displaced at locations mi, the uctuation spectrum is changed to {r/2+mi}

accordingly.

5 m2 on m(atrix) o4-orientifold

in this section, we will extend the analysis of section 3 to m2 located on o4-orientifold in

m(atrix) theory.

5.1 m2 versus o4-orientifold

we will consider an m2 extended parallel to an o4-orientifold. the o4-orientifold spans
r4,1 = (t, x 1,   , x 4) and an m2 stretched along (x 1, x 2) directions at a distance r/2 along
x 9 direction. thus, in the covering space viewpoint, the conguration is given as in eq.(2),

viz. a m2 - m2 dipole separated each other by a distance r. again, the m2 -o4 conguration

is not a bps state as it breaks all of thirty-two supersymmetries of the m(atrix) theory.

we will now analyze stability of the m2 on o4 orientifold explicitly following the same

analysis as the o8 orientifold case.

5.2 m2 on o4 orientifold

for o4 orientifold corresponding to so chan-paton gauge bundle of zero-brane partons,
from the orientifold projection rules, one only keeps even modes of y 1,   , y 4, odd modes of
y 5,   , y 9, and even / odd modes for each chiral sector of as.

the potential for m2 -o4 is then readily obtained by summing over the modes that are

left after the orientifold projection:

vso(r) =



xm=1(cid:18)(cid:26)qr2 + 2c(4m  5) +qr2 + 2c(4m  1)(cid:27)
+(cid:26)2qr2 + 2c(4m  3) + 4qr2 + 2c(4m  1)(cid:27)
2qr2 + 2c(4m)  4qr2 + 2c(4m  2)  2qr2 + 2c(4m  4)(cid:19) .

(21)

terms in each line come from projection to even modes of y 1, y 2 for the rst line, which
automatically picks up odd modes of y 9, and to even and odd modes of y 3, y 4 and of y 5,   , y 8
respectively for the second line. terms in the third line are from even and odd modes of for
(1  )a, whose decomposition follows from the fact that [, ] = 0 .

obviously, for r  0, the static potential is complex-valued, arising from the presence of a
tachyon mode even after the orientifold projection (the n = 0 term in eq.(9)). thus, m2 near
o4-orientifold is not a stable state.

10

behavior of the static potential for r   can be extracted from an integral representation:

one nds that the potential is attractive. thus, much as in o8-orientifold, the m2 localized
near o4-orientifold will be attracted toward the orientifold and eventually absorbed into it.

5.3 m2 on o4+ orientifold

turning next to o4+ orientifold corresponding to usp chan-paton gauge bundle of zero-brane

partons, from the projection rules, one now keeps

vusp(r) =

2qr2 + 2c(4m)  4qr2 + 2c(4m  2)  2qr2 + 2c(4m  4)(cid:19)

again, terms in the rst line come from projection to odd modes of y 1, y 2, which automatically
projects to even modes of y 9, and those in the second line are from projection to odd modes
of y 3, y 4 and even modes of y 5,   , y 8, respectively.

from eq.(24), one clearly sees that the static potential for r  0 is well-dened, as the

tachyon mode, (n = 0 of eq.(9)), is projected out completely, as in the o8+-orientifold.
for r  , the static potential can be extracted from the integral representation:

5.4 t5/z2 orientifolds and twisted sector states

if the covering space m5 of the orientifold is compact, from the analysis of section 4.4, one
would expect that the stability as well as static potential of the m2 conguration becomes

modied. the modication arises due to interaction between the m2 and twisted sector of the

orientifold.

in so far as the twisted sector is concerned, there is one important dierence of the o4-

orientifold from the o8-orientifold. it has actually more to do with peculiarity of the twisted
sector in o8 orientifold. for example, the twisted sector of the o8 orientifold consists only of

fermions that are gauge singlets under the chan-paton gauge group [14, 13, 15].

in contrast, for o4+ orientirfold, the twisted sector is described by (dimensional reduction
of) chiral multiplets of d = 6,n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory. thus, the twisted sector
modes are localized at the xed points and do not couple to elds along the orientifold directions,

viz. the excitation energy spectrum is again a function of r alone. as such, when summing up

the uctuations, bosonic contribution of the twisted sector is cancelled exactly by the fermionic

contribution. thus, for m2 near o4 orientifold, the twisted sector does not lead to any change

to the stability criterion nor to the static potential energy.

5.5

summary

m2 is a stable, non-bps conguration when located on o4+ orientifold, but exhibits a tachy-
onic instability if located on o4 orientifold.

6 comparison with k-theoretic classication

one would like to see whether the stable conguration of non-bps m2 on orientifolds analyzed

in the previous section can be understood from an independent analysis, for example, k-theory

classication. the relevant k-theoretic analysis has been already given in [9] . according to
[6, 7], the ramond-ramond charges in type iia string theory takes values in k1(x), the
subgroup of k(s1  x) consisting of trivial elements when restricted to a point on s1.

for z2 orientifolds, according to the proposal of [9], the ramond-ramond charges of dq-

12

brane on op-orientifold is classied by 5

ko(dpq, dpq) = ko(pq)()

(27)

for op-orientifold which projects the chan-paton gauge bundle of dp-brane to so-type, and

ksp(dpq, dpq) = ksp(pq)() = ko(pq+4)()

(28)

for op-orientifold which projects the chan-paton gauge bundle of dp-brane to usp-type, re-
spectively. here, dp,q denotes the unit disc in rp+q to which the z2 involution acts as +1 on
the rst p directions and as 1 on the remaining q directions, and bott periodicity has been
invoked.

applied to the cases of interest, where p  q = 2 or 6, one nds

and

p  q = 2

: ko2() = z2
ksp2() = 0

for so  projection
for usp  projection

p  q = 6

: ko6() = 0
ksp6() = z2

for so  projection
for usp  projection.

(29)

(30)

recall that we have adopted, from m(atrix) theory point of view, a more natural notation for

classifying orientifold projection to so or usp chan-paton gauge bundle was in terms of that of

zero-brane partons of the m(atrix) theory (see the footnote 3). in the weak coupling limit of the

m-theory, the zero-brane parton is identied with the d0-brane of type iia string theory and,

similarly, m-theory orientifolds with type iia orientifolds. one can thus associate, taking into
account of the bott periodicity, the m(atrix) o8 orientifolds with type iia o8 orientifolds
with projection to usp(so) chan-paton gauge bundles, and m(atrix) o4 orientifolds with

type iia o4 orientifolds with projection to so (usp) gauge bundles.

one thus nds that the k-theory classication given in eqs.(29, 30) matches perfectly with

the result we have deduced directly from m(atrix) theory in the previous sections, provided the

latter is interpreted in the weak coupling, type iia string theory limit of the m-theory.

7 conclusion

in this paper, in m(atrix) theory, we have presented a few examples of a stable, non-bps

m-brane conguration on an m-orientifold plane. we have proposed m(atrix) theory rules for

orientifold projection to the uctuation spectrum around a given conguaration and hence for

stability criterion. we have found that the examples found directly using the rules are in perfect

agreement with the predictions based on k-theoretic classication. our approach is inherently

based on m(atrix) theoretic description of bps branes and orientifolds and is readily applicable

to the type iib matrix theory [20] or to the type i matrix theory [21].

moreover, combining the method developed in this paper with recent work of [22], where
m(atrix) theory (p 2)-brane is constructed as a vortex conguration of the eective abelian
higgs model on the worldvolume of p-brane and p-brane pair, it ought to be possible to explore

deeper aspects of stable (bps or not) branes in m-theory. further results along this direction

will be reported elsewhere.

we are grateful to b.s. acharya, m.r. gaberdiel, k. hori and a. sen for helpful discussions.
