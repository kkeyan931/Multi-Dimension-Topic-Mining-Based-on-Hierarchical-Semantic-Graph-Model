1 introduction

d-branes at orbifold singularities have been intensively studied for recent years (see [1]-[17]
for example). one of the purposes is to investigate geometries of spacetime. d-branes serve
as tools to study ultrashort structure of spacetime. so it is interesting to study geometries
by using d-branes as probes and compare them with geometries probed by point particles
or fundamental strings. orbifolds provide nontrivial but relatively simple examples for
such a purpose.

another motivation to study d-branes on orbifolds is to construct large families of gauge
theories. various choices of orbifolds lead to gauge theories with various supersymmetries
and dimensions. it is well-known that gauge theories can be constructed by using brane
congurations following the work of [18]. investigations from dierent approaches and com-
parison between them are useful to clarify various aspects of gauge theories. investigations
along this line have been made in [19, 20, 12] for example.

in this paper, we study d-branes on three-dimensional nonabelian orbifolds c3/ with
  su(3). for these cases, the gauge theories have 1/8 supersymmetry compared with
type ii string theory. it is known that nite subgroups of su(3) are classied into ade-
like series [21, 22, 23]. we are concerned with d-type subgroups (3n2) and (6n2),
where n is a positive integer and the number in braces represents the order of the group.
in studying d-brane gauge theory on c3/, the quiver diagram of  plays an important
role. the quiver diagram of  is a diagram which represents algebraic structure of .
it consists of nodes and arrows connecting the nodes. the nodes represent irreducible
representations of , while the arrows represent structure of tensor products between a
certain faithful three-dimensional representation and the irreducible representations. in the
gauge theory, the nodes represent gauge groups and the arrows represent matter contents.
the quiver diagrams of the groups (3n2) and (6n2) were calculated in [16]. the quiver
diagram of (3n2) can be considered as a z3 quotient of that of zn  zn, and the quiver
diagram of (6n2) is obtained by a further z2 quotient. in [16], it was also pointed out that
these quiver diagrams have similar structure to a web of (p, q)5-branes of type iib string
theory [28, 29]. so it is natural to expect that the d-brane gauge theories can be realized
by brane congurations involving such a web of (p, q) branes. the purpose of the present
paper is to construct brane congurations corresponding to d-branes on c3/(3n2) and
c3/(6n2).

in constructing brane congurations, the brane box model [30, 12] provides useful
information. the brane box model is a realization of d-brane gauge theory on c3/zn  zn
via brane congurations. what is remarkable on the brane box model is that there is a
correspondence between the quiver diagram of zn  zn and the brane conguration for
c3/zn zn. we use such a correspondence as a guideline to construct brane congurations
for c3/. as stated above, the quiver diagram of (3n2) is a z3 quotient of that of
zn  zn. therefore, combining with the correspondence between quiver diagrams and
brane congurations, we expect that the brane conguration for c3/(3n2) is obtained

2

from that for c3/zn  zn by a z3 quotient. however, we can not dene a z3 quotient on
the brane box conguration since the z3 is not a symmetry of the conguration. so we
can not use the brane box conguration itself as a conguration for c3/zn  zn. instead,
we construct a brane conguration with a z3 symmetry maintaining the correspondence
with the quiver diagram of zn  zn. it consists of d3-branes and a web of (p, q) 5-branes
of type iib string theory. the brane conguration for c3/(3n2) is obtained from such
a conguration by a z3 quotient. we can see that the conguration naturally reproduces
the structure of the quiver diagram of (3n2). in other words, the brane conguration can
be considered as a physical realization of the quiver diagram. the brane conguration for
c3/(6n2) is obtained by a further z2 quotient.

the quiver diagram of  is also a key ingredient in the discussion of what is called
mckay correspondence[24]-[27]. the mckay correspondence is a relation between the
representation theory of a nite group  and the geometries of cd/. it was originally
found for d = 2 and   sl(2, c). the mckay correspondence states that the quiver
diagram of  coincides with a diagram which represent intersections among exceptional

divisors of gc2/. (fx represents the minimal resolution of x.) we are concerned with
its generalization to three dimensions. if  is abelian, c3/ becomes a toric variety, and
its resolution can be discussed by using toric method.
in [31], relations between brane
congurations and toric diagrams were discussed. applying such arguments to the case
 = zn  zn, we can see that the brane conguration and the orbifolds are related by t-
duality, and the brane conguration is graphically dual to the corresponding toric diagram.
combining with an observation that the brane conguration for c3/ can be regarded as
the quiver diagram of , we can say that the quiver diagram and the toric diagram are
related by t-duality. since the toric diagram represents geometric information of the
orbifold such as intersections among exceptional divisors, it leads to an interpretation that
the three-dimensional mckay correspondence can be understood as t-duality.

the organization of this paper is as follows.

in section 2, we review a prescription
to obtain worldvolume gauge theory of d-branes on an orbifold c3/. we also present
quiver diagrams for  = (3n2) and (6n2) calculated in [16].
in section 3, we rst
review the brane box model. then we construct a brane conguration for c3/zn  zn
which is appropriate to construct brane conguraions for nonabelian orbifolds. by taking
its quotient, we construct brane congurations for c3/(3n2) and c3/(6n2). we argue
that the structure of the quiver diagrams of (3n2) and (6n2) can be explained by the
brane congurations. in section 4, we discuss relations between brane congurations and
toric diagrams. based on the discussion of [31] which relates brane congurations and toric
diagrams, we present evidence that the three dimensional mckay correspondence may be
interpreted as t-duality. section 5 is devoted to discussions.

2 quiver diagrams for d-branes on nonabelian orb-

ifolds

in this section, we review the results of [16], in which the quiver diagrams for d-branes
on orbifolds c3/ with  = (3n2) and (6n2) were obtained. we start with n parallel
d1-branes on c3 where n = || is the order of . we will discuss the reason to take
d1-branes in sections 3 and 4. the eective action of the d-branes is given by the di-
mensional reduction of ten-dimensional u(n) super yang-mills theory to two-dimensions.
the bosonic eld contents are a u(n) gauge eld a and four complex adjoint scalars x 
( = 1, 2, 3) and y . fermionic eld contents are determined via unbroken supersymmetry,
so we do not touch upon them. we take  to act on complex three-dimensional space
corresponding to x . since y is irrelevant in the following discussions, we set y = 0.
next we project this theory onto  invariant space. the condition is expressed as

rreg(g)arreg(g)1 = a,
 rreg(g)x rreg(g)1 = x 

r3(g)

(2.1)
(2.2)

where g  , r3 is a three-dimensional representation of  which acts on spacetime indices
 and rreg is the n  n regular representation of  which acts on chan-paton indices.
r3 denes how  acts on c3 to form the quotient singularity. the condition (2.1) implies
that gauge elds surviving the projection are -invariant parts of rreg  r
reg. since the
regular representation rreg has the following decomposition

rreg = r

a=1nara, na = dimra

(2.3)

where ra denotes an irreducible representation of  and r is the number of irreducible
representations of , we obtain the following expression,

rreg  r

reg|inv = abna nbra  rb|inv

= ana na.

(2.4)

here we used schurs lemma. the equation means that the gauge symmetry of the resulting
theory is

ry

a=1

u(na).

if we consider n d-branes on the orbifold, the gauge group becomes

ry

a=1

u(nna).

one can see the matter contents after the projection (2.2) in a similar way. they are -
reg. by dening the tensor product of the three-dimensional

invariant parts of r3 rreg r
representation r3 and an irreducible representation ra as

r3  ra = r

b=1nabrb,

(2.7)

4

(2.5)

(2.6)

one obtains the following expression,

r3  rreg  r

reg|inv = abcnabna ncrb  rc|inv

= abnabna nb.

(2.8)

it means that nab is the number of bifundamental elds which transform as na  nb under
u(na)  u(nb).

the gauge group and the spectrum are summarized in a quiver diagram. a quiver
diagram consists of r nodes corresponding to irreducible representations and arrows which
connect these nodes corresponding to bifundamental matters. outgoing arrows represent
fundamentals and ingoing arrows represent anti-fundamentals. nab is the number of arrows
from the a-th node to the b-th node.

2.1 (3n2) case

the group (3n2) consists of the following elements

ai,j =




i
0
n
0 j
n
0 ij

n

n

n

(2.9)
where n = e2i/n and 0  i, j < n. the n2 elements {ai,j} correspond to a three-
dimensional reducible representation of the abelian group zn  zn. the elements of the
group (3n2) are obtained by multiplying the the following matrices



1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1

0 1 0
0 0 1
1 0 0

0 0 1
1 0 0
0 1 0


 ,




(2.10)





 ,




to the elements {ai,j}. the matrices (2.10) are the elements of the group z3, so the group
(3n2) is isomorphic to the semidirect product of zn  zn and z3.

we rst consider the cases with n / 3z. the irreducible representations of (3n2)
consists of one-dimensional representations and three-dimensional representations. there
are 3 one-dimensional representations which we denote as r
1 ( = 0, 1, 2). the three-
dimensional representations are labeled by two integers (l1, l2)  zn  zn with (l1, l2) 6=
(0, 0). furthermore there are equivalence relations among the representations r(l1,l2)

,

3

r(l1,l2)

3

 r(l1+l2,l1)

3

 r(l2,l1l2)

3

.

(2.11)

thus the three-dimensional representations are labeled by the lattice points (zn  zn 
(0, 0))/z3 where the action of z3 is dened by the relation (2.11). by counting the number
of the lattice points in (zn  zn  (0, 0))/z3 one can see that there are (n2  1)/3 three-
dimensional irreducible representations. thus the gauge group of the d-brane worldvolume
theory on c3/(3n2) is u(1)3  u(3)(n2

1)/3.

. by calculating tensor products between r(m1,m2)

now we choose the three-dimensional representation acting on the spacetime indices to
be r(m1,m2)
and irreducible representa-
tions of (3n2), we can depict the quiver diagram of (3n2) in a closed form. an example
will be given in section 3. however, it becomes very complicated as n increases, so it is
not useful to analyze structure of the gauge theories. therefore we would like to depict the
quiver diagram of (3n2) in a form such that its structure becomes simple. to this end,
it is useful to dene r(0,0)

as

3

3  r0

1  r1

1  r2
1.

(2.12)

3

r(0,0)
then the tensor products of r(m1,m2)
compact form,

3

and the irreducible representations are given by a

r(m1,m2)

3

 r(l1,l2)

3

= r(l1+m1,l2+m2)

3

 r(l1m2,l2+m1m2)

3

 r(l1m1+m2,l2m1)

3

.

(2.13)

although r(0,0)
is not an irreducible representation, the expression (2.13) is so simple
that we tentatively forget the structure (2.12) and treat it as if it were an irreducible
representation.

3

as stated above, a quiver diagram consists of nodes associated with the irreducible
representations and arrows associated with the structure of the tensor products. in the
present case, the irreducible representations are labeled by two integers modulo n, so we
put the nodes on the lattice points of zn  zn. the equation (2.13) indicates that there
are three arrows which start from each node (l1, l2). the end points are (l1 + m1, l2 + m2),
(l1  m2, l2 + m1  m2) and (l1  m1 + m2, l2  m1). the quiver diagram is obtained
by putting such arrows to each node in zn  zn and identifying the nodes according to
the z3 equivalence relations (2.11). thus the quiver diagram of (3n2) is basically a z3
quotient of that of zn  zn. it is depicted in figure 1. only one set of three arrows is
depicted for simplicity although such a set of arrows start from every node. due to the
z3 identication, the fundamental region is restricted to the parallelogram surrounded by
dashed lines. to be precise, however, we must take the equation (2.12) into consideration.
except for the xed points, z3 quotient means that three one-dimensional nodes related
by z3 must be identied. such nodes become three-dimensional after the z3 quotient. for
the xed points such as the node at the origin, the z3 quotient must be understood as a
splitting into three one-dimensional nodes as indicated by the equation (2.12). the rule
of the z3 quotient on arrows is dened according to the rule on nodes since each arrow is
determined by specifying the starting node and the ending node.

for the cases with n  3z, there are 9 one-dimensional representations which we
denote as r
1 ( = 0, 1, . . . , 8) and three-dimensional representations labeled by (l1, l2) 
zn  zn  f where f = {(0, 0), (n/3, 2n/3), (2n/3, n/3)}. as in the n / 3z cases, there are
equivalence relations (2.11). by counting the number of the lattice points in (zn  zn 
f )/z3, one can see that there are (n2  3)/3 three-dimensional irreducible representations
when n/3 is an integer. so the gauge group of the d-brane theory is u(1)9  u(3)(n2
3)/3.

the quiver diagram is shown in figure 2. it is essentially the same as in the n / 3z cases
except that the nodes (n/3, 2n/3) and (2n/3, n/3) lie at xed points of the z3 action.

2.2 (6n2) case

we now turn to the group (6n2). the group (6n2) with n a positive integer consists of
{ai,j, ci,j, ei,j} in (2.9) and the following matrices.

to the elements {ai,j} in (2.9). note that the six matrices (2.10) and (2.19) are the
elements of the symmetric group s3 of order six. thus the group (6n2) is isomorphic to
the semidirect product of zn  zn and s3.

when n/3 is not an integer, the irreducible representations consist of 2 one-dimensional
representations, 1 two-dimensional representation, 2(n  1) three-dimensional represen-
tations and (n2  3n + 2)/6 six-dimensional representations. thus the gauge group is
u(1)2 u(2)u(3)2(n1) u(6)(n2
3n+2)/6. we denote the one-dimensional representations
as rt
1 (t  z2), the two-dimensional representation as r2 and the three-dimensional repre-
sentations as r(l,l)t
, where l = 1, 2, . . . , n  1 and t takes values in z2. the six-dimensional
representations are labeled by (l1, l2)  zn  zn  f  where f  = {(0, 0), (l, l), (l, 0), (0, l)}.
as in the (3n2) cases, there are equivalence relations among the representations r(l1,l2)

hence the six-dimensional representations are labeled by the lattice points (zn  zn 
f )/s3. here s3 is the semidirect product of groups z3 and z2 whose action are dened
by the relations (2.20) and (2.21) respectively. (n2  3n + 2)/6 is the number of the lattice
points in (zn  zn  f )/s3 when n/3 is not an integer.

the quiver diagram is depicted in figure 3. due to the additional z2 identication of (2.21),
the fundamental region is restricted to, say, the lower triangle surrounded by dashed lines
in figure 3. we note that the nodes at (l, l) correspond to xed points of the z2 action
dened by (2.21). in addition, the node at the origin corresponds to a xed point of the
z3 action dened by (2.20).

when n/3 is an integer, the irreducible representations consist of 2 one-dimensional
representations, 4 two-dimensional representations, 2(n  1) three-dimensional represen-
tations and (n2  3n)/6 six-dimensional representations. so the gauge group is u(1)2

cases except that the node (2n/3, n/3) lies at a xed point of the z3 action.

3 brane congurations for nonabelian orbifolds

in the last section, we have presented the quiver diagrams for d-branes on orbifolds c3/
with  = (3n2) and (6n2). unexpectedly the quiver diagrams have a resemblance to
the structure of string junctions [28] or webs of (p, q) 5-branes [29]. three (p, q) strings of

string theory. similar conditions must be satised to form a prong of (p, q) 5-branes. the
arrows in the quiver diagrams representing matter contents have the same structure. it is
likely that the gauge theory represented by the quiver diagram have something to do with
string junctions or a web of (p, q) 5-branes. in this section, we consider realizations of the
gauge theories of d-branes on the nonabelian orbifolds by using such brane congurations.
to investigate the brane congurations for nonabelian orbifolds c3/, we rst review
the brane box model, which is a brane conguration corresponding to d-branes on an
abelian orbifold c3/zn  zn [30, 12]. as noted in the last section, the nite groups (3n2)
and (6n2) are closely related to zn  zn. we study the brane congurations for c3/
based on the brane box model by using relations between the groups  and zn  zn.

irreducible representations of the nite group zn zn consist of n2 one-dimensional rep-
with (l1, l2)  zn zn. we choose the three-dimensional representation

resentations r(l1,l2)
which denes the geometry of the orbifold to be

r3 = r(1,1)

1  r(1,0)

then the decomposition of the product r3  r(l1,l2)

becomes

= r(l1+1,l2+1)

the quiver diagram is given in figure 5. the point we would like to emphasize is that the
quiver diagram for the orbifold c3/(3n2) (c3/(6n2)) is essentially that for the orbifold
c3/zn  zn with the z3 equivalence relation (2.11) (the s3 equivalence relation (2.20) and
(2.21)).

the brane box is a model that provides the same gauge theory as the d-brane world-
volume theory on c3/zn  zn.
it consists of the following set of branes; ns5-branes
along 012345 directions, ns5-branes along 012367 directions and d5-branes along 012346
directions. the brane box conguration is shown in figure 6. it represents the brane con-
guration on the 46-plane. ns and ns 5-branes are indicated by horizontal and vertical
lines respectively. d5-branes lie on each box bounded by ns and ns 5-branes. in the
brane box model, the rst ns5(ns5)-brane and the (n+1)-th ns5(ns5)-branes must be
identied. the interest focuses on the gauge theory on the world-volume of the d5-branes.
being nite in 46 directions, the d5-branes are macroscopically (3+1)-dimensional. each
box provides a gauge group u(na) where na denotes the number of d-branes on the a-th
box. open strings connecting d-branes on neighboring boxes provide matters. in the ab-
sence of ns5 and ns5-branes, two possible orientations are allowed for the strings. the

orientation of ns5 and ns5-branes induces a particular orientation for the strings. one
possible choice of orientations of strings is shown in figure 6 [30]. only one set of three
open strings is drawn although such a set of strings stretch from every box. the oriented
open strings stretching from d-branes on the a-th box to d-branes on the b-th box provide
bifundamental matters na  nb. thus the matter contents of the brane box model are just
what determined by the quiver diagram in figure 5. we make a list of correspondence
among representation theory, gauge theory, quiver diagram and brane box model in table
1.

we regard the correspondence between the quiver diagram and the brane conguration
as a guideline in constructing brane congurations. as discussed in section 2, the quiver
diagram of (3n2) is obtained from that of zn  zn by the z3 quotient. thus a naive guess
leads to the idea that the brane conguration for the orbifold c3/(3n2) is obtained from
the brane box conguration by the z3 quotient. however, we can not dene a z3 quotient
on the brane box conguration since z3 is not a symmetry of the conguration of figure
6. instead, we construct a brane conguration for c3/zn  zn which has the z3 symmetry
maintaining the correspondence of table 1. global structure is determined by the require-

11

ment that it provides appropriate gauge groups and matter contents given in table 1. the
requirement of the z3 symmetry leads to a condition on the local structure. naively it
leads to a prong which consists of three branes with directions (m1, m2), (m2, m1  m2)
and (m2  m1, m1) on a plane. however, the z3 equivalence relation (2.11) is dened
on the lattice of irreducible representations.
it means that the z3 action on the brane
conguration is dened in reference to the lattice of boxes. thus it is necessary to take
directions of alignment of boxes into account. there are innitely many possibilities which
satisfy these criteria. two examples are depicted in figure 7(a) and (b).

(b)

figure 7: two examples of brane congurations with a z3 symmetry and the correspon-
dence to the quiver diagram of zn zn. arrows represent open strings connecting d-branes
on neighboring boxes. the small parallelogram bounded by dashed lines represents funda-
mental region under the action of z3.

these gures represent brane congurations on the 56-plane. the lines indicate (p, q)
5-branes which extend along 01234 directions and p +  q direction in the 56-plane. here we
take  = i. the dierence between figure 7(a) and figure 7(b) is charges (p, q) of 5-branes.
three types of 5-branes in figure 7(a) have (p, q) charges (2, 1), (1, 1) and (1, 2),
while three types of 5-branes in figure 7(b) have (p, q) charges (1, 1), (1, 0) and (0, 1).
although we do not have a way to judge which is the right one at present, we will discuss in
section 4 that the figure 7(b) is the right one for the brane conguraiton for c3/zn  zn.
each hexagon plays the role of each square of the brane box model. in contrast to the
brane box model, however, d-branes on each box must be d3-branes stretching along
0156 directions to maintain 1/8 supersymmetry. since d3-branes are bounded by (p, q)
5-branes in 56-directions, their eective action is two-dimensional. this is why we started
with d1-branes on orbifolds.

to realize the correspondence given in table 1 for  = (3n2), we must identify the
rst row and the n-th row and the rst column and the n-th column. as in the brane box

12

model, each box gives a gauge group u(na) where na is the number of d-branes on the
a-th box. we let the number of d1-branes on c3/zn  zn be one, then na becomes one
for every box. matters come from open strings which connect d-branes on neighboring
boxes. the presence of (p, q) 5-branes induces a particular orientation for the strings.
relative orientations of strings are restricted by the requirement of the invariance under
the z3 action. there are two possibilities; one is shown in figure 7. the arrows indicate
the orientations of strings stretching from one box. again only one set of three open
strings is drawn although such a set of strings stretch from every box. these open strings
reproduce the matter contents determined by the quiver diagram in figure 1 for the case
r(m1,m2)
. another set of orientations is obtained by reversing the orientations of all
arrows, which is essentially equivalent to the case shown in figure 7. although we discussed
orientations of open strings by the requirement of the z3 invariance, it is necessary to nd
out a reason that only such orientations are allowed based on string theory.

now that we have a brane conguration for c3/zn  zn with a z3 symmetry, we make
a z3 quotient to obtain a brane conguration for c3/(3n2). the z3 quotient on the
brane conguration is dened through that on the quiver diagram. by the z3 quotient,
fundamental region becomes the small parallelogram bounded by dashed lines in figure
7. we would like to show that the brane conguration precisely reproduces the structure
of the quiver diagram of (3n2). we take n = 4 as an example. the quiver diagram
of (3n2) with n = 4 can be depicted in a closed form as in figure 8(a). the brane
conguration for c3/(3n2) can also be drawn in a closed form as in figure 8(b). it is

arrows represent open strings connecting d-branes on neighboring boxes.

basically a z3 orbifold of a two-torus t 2. three apexes in figure 8(b) corresponds to the
xed points of z3. there are three d-branes on ve boxes which do not include the xed
points, and hence each box gives a gauge group u(3). on the other hand, the d-brane on
the box which include the xed point has spiral structure as illustrated in figure 8(b) due
to the orbifolding procedure. in this case, an oriented open string stretching from the i-th

13

d-brane to the j-th d-brane is the same as an open string stretching from the (i + 1)-th
d-brane to the (j + 1)-th d-brane (modulo 3). since the (i, j) component of the gauge
eld comes from the oriented open string from the i-th d-brane to the j-th d-brane, the
3  3 components of the gauge eld take the following form,

a 




a1 a2 a3
a3 a1 a2
a2 a3 a1


 .

(3.4)

it means that the box including the xed point gives the gauge group u(1)3 instead of u(3).
as for the matters, they come from open strings which connect d-branes on neighboring
boxes. locally, every boundary between two boxes has the same structure; there are three
d-branes on both sides, so each boundary gives a matter with 3  3 components. the
(i, j) component comes from an oriented open string stretching from the i-th d-brane on
one side to the j-th d-brane on the other side. dierence comes from global structure
of d-branes meeting at each boundary. it determines how the matters transform under
the gauge groups.
if boxes on both side do not include xed points of z3, the matter
transforms as a bifundamental 3  3 of u(3)  u(3). if a box on one side of the boundary
include a xed point, the corresponding representation 3 splits into 1  1  1 1. thus the
3  3 components of the matter coming from such a boundary split into three 3  1 or three
1  3. they coincide with the spectrum indicated by the arrows in the quiver diagram.
collecting these results, one can see that the brane conguration in figure 8(b) presicely
reproduces the structure of the quiver diagram in figure 8(a).

in the n / 3z case, only one of the three apexes is included in a box and the other two
lie at boundaries of some boxes as shown in figure 8(b). for n  3z, on the other hand,
we can see that three apexes lie inside of three boxes respectively. therefore each box at
the apex gives a gauge group factor u(1)3 in accordance with the structure of the quiver
diagram.

now we would like to comment on the correspondence between the brane conguration
and the quiver diagram. in the denition of the z3 action on the quiver diagram, a rather
elaborate rule was necessary in relation to the xed points of z3. in contrast, the rule of
the z3 quotient are automatically reproduced via the brane congurations although the
quotienting procedure on the brane congurations is simple. in this respect, we can say that
the brane conguration inherently posesses necessary property which the quiver diagrams
should have. in other words, it seems reasonable to regard the brane conguration as a
realization of the quiver diagram in the language of physics.

the brane conguration for c3/(6n2) is obtained by making a z2 quotient in addition
to the z3 quotient for c3/(3n2). the z2 quotient is determined through the relation
(2.21) which denes the z2 action on the quiver diagram. one can see that the brane

1if we consider n d-branes on an orbifold, the gauge group coming from the box including a xed point
is u (n )3 instead of u (3n ). accordingly, 3n dimensional representation splits into n  n  n ; each n
represents n -dimensional representation of each u (n ).

14

conguration reproduces the structure of the quiver diagram of c3/(6n2) by a similar
argument to the c3/(3n2) cases.

4 physical interpretation of mckay correspondence

in this section, we would like to discuss relations between the brane congurations obtained
in the last section and geometries of c3/. as we mentioned, the brane conguration for
c3/ plays the role of the quiver diagram of , hence the relation can be considered as a
relation between the tensor product structure of irreducible representations of  and the
geometry of c3/. such a relation has been discussed in mathematics as the mckay corre-
spondence. we will present evidence that the mckay correspondence may be understood
as t-duality.

before we come to the discussion on duality, we make it clear what we mean by the term
mckay correspondence. the mckay correspondence was originally observed for two-
dimensional orbifolds[24]. it is a relation between the quiver diagram of  and a diagram

representing intersections among exceptional divisors of gc2/. both of them coincide

with a certain dynkin diagram of ade lie algebra. we consider its straightforward
generalization as a three-dimensional mckay correspondence. that is, we use the term
mckay correspondence to refer to a relation between the quiver diagram of  and a diagram

which represents intersections among exceptional divisors of gc3/. if  is abelian, c3/

becomes a toric variety and its resolution is discussed by using toric method. in this case,
information on intersections among exceptional divisors is represented by a toric diagram.
in summary, we use the term mckay correspondence in dimension three as a relation

between the quiver diagram of  and the toric diagram of gc3/.

fortunately, relations between brane congurations and toric varieties were generally
discussed in [31]. to explain the idea of [31], we briey review toric virieties. a com-
plex d-dimensional toric variety involves real d-dimensional torus t d. certain cycles of
the torus t d shrink on some loci of the toric variety. a toric variety is determined by
specifying which cycles shrink where. such information is represented by a diagram in
real d-dimensional space, which we call a toric diagram. information on (co)homology of
the toric variety is encoded in the toric diagram. for toric varieties with vanishing rst
chern class, toric diagrams are reduced to diagrams in (d  1)-dimensional space. as we
are considering complex three-dimensional toric varieties with vanishing rst chern class,
their toric diagrams represent how a torus t 2 of the toric variety shrinks. more precisely,
what is identied with loci where t 2 shrinks is a dual diagram of the toric diagram. a line
in the dual diagram with a slope q/p represents locus at which a (p, q) cycle of t 2 shrinks.
keeping the property of toric varieties in mind, we turn to the explanation of [31] which
relates brane congurations and toric diagrams. it is known that m-theory on t 2 and type
iib string theory on a circle s1 are related by a kind of t-duality [32]. vanishing (p, q)
cycles of t 2 of m-theory corresponds to (p, q) 5-branes of type iib string theory. if we

15

consider m-theory on a toric variety and dualize in this sense along the 2-torus t 2 of the
toric variety, we obtain type iib string theory on a circle with (p, q) 5-branes; the skeleton
of the dual diagram is identied with a web of (p, q) 5-branes.

we would like to apply this argument to the case  = zn  zn. the toric diagram of
a certain resolution of the orbifold c3/zn  zn is depicted in figure 9. its dual diagram
depicted in figure 10 represents a web of (p, q) 5-branes in the sense described above. the

figure 9: the toric diagram for
a resolution of c3/zn  zn with
n = 4.

figure 10: the dual diagram of
figure 9.

brane conguration in figure 10 has the same structure as the conguration for c3/zn zn
in figure 7(b) at least locally. in this sense, the brane conguration for c3/zn  zn, which
can be interpreted as the quiver diagram of zn  zn, and the toric diagram of c3/zn  zn
are related by t-duality. the global structure of figure 10, however, is dierent from that
of figure 7(b); to obtain the brane conguration in figure 7(b), we must combine two
brane congurations in figure 10 and make a certain identication. the dierence stems
from the non-compactness of the orbifold. the models discussed in section 3 are so-called
elliptic models; they are compactied along 56 directions to t 2. on the other hand, the
toric diagram in figure 9 represents an open variety which does not have such compactness.
in fact, such a manifold is not appropriate to perform t-duality since the radii of the circles
performing t-duality become innite as the distance from the singularity becomes innite.
in order to make the t-duality argument precise, we must replace the toric variety by a
maniofold which have the same local structure but have another asymptotics, so that the
radii of the circles are nite at innity. it is analogous to the replacement of c2/zn with a
taub-nut space. we hope that the correspondence between the brane conguration and
the toric diagram can be made denite when such a replacement is properly taken into
account.

thus it needs further study to make the t-duality argument precise, but there are
some evidences to support such an argument. first, we would like to point out a nontrivial
coincidence between the physical argument presented above and mathematical argument

16

on the mckay correspondence. in resolving the singularity of c3/zn  zn, there are many
possibilities related by topology changing process called a op. among such resolutions,
only one resolution represented by the toric diagram in figure 9 has a relation to the brane
conguration for c3/zn  zn. in the mathematical argument [27], the mckay correspon-
dence is proved only for a paticular kind of resolution. it is so-called the hilbert scheme
of c3/zn  zn, whose toric diagram is nothing but figure 9. although the formulation
of the mckay correspondence in [27] is dierent from the naive one we are considering,
it seems reasonable to regard the coincidence as a supporting evidence for the t-duality
interpretation of the mckay correspondence.

now we turn to the case  = (3n2). since the orbifolds c3/(3n2) is not a toric
variety, we can not directly apply the above argument. however, the brane conguration
for c3/(3n2) is obtained from that for c3/zn  zn by the z3 quotient. so we use this
relation to discuss the geometry of c3/(3n2). the z3 action on the brane conguration
can be translated to the action on the toric diagram through the relation between the
figure 9 and figure 10. for example, z3 acts cyclically on three apexes of the triangle
which lies at the center of the toric diagram. since each lattice point inside the toric
diagram represent an exceptional divisor, the z3 quotient means that the three divisors
must be identied. in this way, we obtain a z3 quotient of the toric variety c3/zn  zn.
the z3 action on the quiver diagram is illustrated in figure 11.

figure 11: the z3 quotient of the toric diagram for c3/zn  zn.

in fact, resolutions of the singularity of c3/(3n2) were discussed in [33, 34, 35].
broadly speaking, the singularity is resolved by the following procedure. first, consider
toric resolutions of the abelian orbifold c3/zn  zn. then perform a certain z3 quotient,
and nally resolve singularities which occur due to the z3 quotienting procedure. the
group z3 permutes exceptional divisors of the toric resolution of c3/zn  zn.
in fact,
the z3 quotient is equivalent to that represented in figure 11 if we consider figure 9 as
a resolution of c3/zn  zn. although the z3 actions are equivalent, the origins are quite
dierent. the z3 action in figure 11 were determined by the discussion on the quiver
diagrams, so it originates from the representation theory of (3n2). on the other hand,

17

the z3 action in the process of the resolution of the singularity comes from geometrical
argument. the coincidence between the two z3 actions can be considered as one aspect of
the mckay correspondence for  = (3n2), and again it serves as a supporting evidence
for the t-duality interpretation of the mckay correspondence.

now we comment on the dierence between the brane conguration of figure 7(a) and
that of figure 7(b). they are only dierent in (p, q) charges of 5-branes. from the toric
geometry point of view, however, there is an essential dierence [29]. the toric diagram
corresponding to the conguration of figure 7(a) before the z3 identication is depicted
in figure 12(a). in the gure, there is a lattice point in each triangle in contrast to figure
9. it means that the orbifold singularity is not fully resolved. to resolve fully the orbifold
singularity, we must subdivide the toric diagram as shown in figure 12(b). then each
junction of (p, q) 5-branes is replaced by figure 12(c)2. on the other hand, each junction
in figure 7(b) can not be made such a replacement. therefore we can determine the right
(p, q) charges of 5-branes by requiring that each junction can not be replaced by a set of
junctions as in figure 12(c).

5 discussions

in this paper, we have studied brane congurations corresponding to d-branes on non-
abelian orbifolds c3/(3n2) and c3/(6n2) based on the analyses of the quiver diagrams.
we rst constructed the brane conguration for c3/zn  zn by requiring that it had a
z3 symmetry. it consists of a web of (p, q) 5-branes and d3-branes. by making a z3 (s3)
quotient, we have obtained the brane condigurations for c3/(3n2) (c3/(6n2)). the

2this kind of conguration is considered in [36] in the context of brane box models.

18

structure of the quiver diagrams of (3n2) and (6n2) can be naturally explained via the
brane congurations. we have also discussed relations between the brane congurations
and toric diagrams. based on the argument which relates branes and the toric geometry,
we have pointed out that the three-dimensional mckay correspondence may be understood
as t-duality.

in [12], it was shown that d3-branes on orbifolds and the brane box model are related by
t-duality. now we would like to make a rough argument to relate the brane congurations
and d-branes on orbifolds. we start with type iib string theory with a web of (p, q) 5-
branes along 01234 directions and one direction of the 56 plane and d3-branes along 0156
directions. we rst t-dualize along direction 9 and decompactify along direction 10. then
we obtain m-theory on an orbifold c3/(3n2) with m5-branes along 01569(10) directions.
here c3/(3n2) extends to 56789(10) directions. to obtain type iib string theory on
orbifolds, we take a limit that the direction 1 shrinks. then we obtain type iia string
theory on c3/(3n2) with d4-branes along 0569(10). next we perform t-dualities along
256 directions. then we obtain type iib string theory on c3/(3n2) with d3-branes. here
c3/(3n2) extends to 56789(10) directions, while d3-branes extend to 029(10) directions.
if such an argument on duality is true, the right interpretation of the d1-branes discussed
in section 2 seems to be d3-branes wrapped around two directions of the orbifold. d-
branes wrapping on each cycle of an orbifold stick to the singularity [37, 38]. however,
since we are considering a set of d-branes which corresponds to the regular representation
of (3n2), they are allowed to move away from the singularity [12]. anyway it needs
further investigation on the argument of duality.

one of the important problems which should be claried is the structure of the kahler
moduli space of nonabelian orbifolds. for three-dimensional abelian orbifolds, their kahler
moduli spaces were examined in [3] by using a toric method combining with the fact that
toric varieties can be realized as vacuum moduli spaces of two-dimensional gauged linear
sigma models [39]. on the other hand, this method can not be applied to nonabelian
orbifolds since they are not toric varieries. the nonabelian orbifolds, however, are related
to toric varieties through a quotienting procedure. it would be interesting to investigate
whether the quotienting procedure can be incorporated into the toric method to analyze
the structure of kahler moduli space of nonabelian orbifolds.

it is also interesting to generalize the work to other cases. for the e-type subgroups of
su(3), a catalogue of quiver diagrams is given in [14]. it is so complicated that construction
of brane congurations seems to be dicult. however, unbroken supersymmetry may
provide us a guide to the construction. for   su(4), classication of nite subgroups
were summarized in [40]. since there is no supersymmetry in these cases, quiver diagrams
representing bosonic matter contents and those representing fermionic matter contents are
dierent. it would be interesting to nd a mechanism to provide such asymmetric matter
contents from brane congurations.
