abstract

we present several non-trivial examples of the three-dimensional quantum
nambu bracket which involve square matrices or three-index objects. our
examples satisfy two fundamental properties of the classical nambu bracket:
they are skew-symmetric and they obey the fundamental identity. we con-
trast our approach to the existing literature on the quantum deformations
of nambu mechanics. we also discuss possible applications of our results in
m-theory.

1 introduction

in 1973 nambu [1] proposed a generalization of hamiltonian mechanics and
statistical mechanics involving odd-dimensional phase-spaces. in particu-
lar, in the case of a three-dimensional phase-space labeled by x, y, z nambu
proposed the following generalized hamilton evolution equation

df
dt

=

(h1, h2, f )

(x, y, z)

(1)

where the right hand side (r.h.s.) denotes the three-dimensional jacobian
of h1(x, y, z), h2(x, y, z), f (x, y, z) with respect to x, y, z and denes the
classical nambu bracket. nambus proposal was motivated by the general
validity of the liouville theorem, as it is apparent from the form of the
evolution equation (1).

it was then noticed that various physical systems described by this formal-
ism in n phase-space dimensions can be realized as singular hamiltonian
systems in 2n phase-space dimensions [2]. the original proposal of nambu
has also been given an elegant geometric formulation by takhtajan [3].

the quantization problem of the classical nambu bracket turned out to
be very dicult. the only existing approach uses an unusual version of
deformation quantization called zariski quantization [4], [5]. however, an
explicit realization of the quantum nambu bracket in terms of matrices, as
posed in the original paper by nambu, still seems to be lacking.

it is one of the aims of this article to present several non-trivial examples
of the quantum version of the nambu bracket in terms of ordinary matrices
and also in terms of three-index objects (cubic matrices). our main moti-
vation for this investigation comes from an expectation that the quantum
nambu bracket might turn out to be a useful technical tool in m-theory.

the article is organized as follows: rst, in section 2, we briey review
the connection between volume preserving dieomorphisms and the clas-
sical nambu bracket, and point out some novel structural features of the
latter. then in section 3, we give an explicit matrix realization of the three-
dimensional quantum nambu bracket which satises two crucial properties
of its classical counterpart: skew-symmetry and the fundamental identity.
we contrast our results to the existing examples obtained in the formalism
of zariski quantization [5]. in section 4, we give an explicit realization of the
three-dimensional quantum nambu bracket in terms of three-index objects,

1

which we call cubic matrices.
in section 5, we present the generalization
of our approach to the n-dimensional quantum nambu bracket. finally in
section 6, we discuss possible applications of our results in m-theory.

2 volume preserving dieomorphisms and the

classical nambu bracket

consider a three-dimensional space parametrized by {xi}. the three-dimensional
volume preserving dieomorphisms (vpd) on this space are described by a
dierentiable map

such that

where, by denition

xi  yi(x)

{y1, y2, y3} = 1

{a, b, c}  ijkiajbkc

(2)

(3)

(4)

is the nambu-poisson (np) bracket, or nambu bracket, or nambu triple
bracket, which satises [3], [4], [5], [6]

1. skew-symmetry

{a1, a2, a3} = (1)(p){ap(1), ap(2), ap(3)},

(5)

where p(i) is the permutation of indices and (p) is the parity of the
permutation,

2. derivation

{a1a2, a3, a4} = a1{a2, a3, a4} + {a1, a3, a4}a2,

(6)

3. fundamental identity (fi-1) [3], [6]

{{a1, a2, a3}, a4, a5} + {a3, {a1, a2, a4}, a5}
+{a3, a4, {a1, a2, a5}} = {a1, a2, {a3, a4, a5}}.

(7)

2

the three-dimensional vpd involves two independent functions. let
these functions be denoted by f and g. the innitesimal three-dimensional
vpd generator is then given as

d(f, g)  ijkif jgk
 dk(f, g)k.

the volume-preserving property is nothing but the identity

idi(f, g) = k(ijkif jg) = 0.

(8)
(9)

(10)

given an arbitrary scalar function x(xi), the three-dimensional vpd acts as

d(f, g)x = {f, g, x}.

(11)

apart from the issue of global denition of the functions f and g, we can
represent an arbitrary innitesimal volume-preserving dieomorphism in this
form.

on the other hand, if the base three-dimensional space {xi} is mapped
into a target space of dimension d + 1 whose coordinates are x  ( =
0, 1, 2, . . . , d), the induced innitesimal volume element is

d  q{x , x , x }2dx1dx2dx3,

(12)

provided the target space is a at euclidean space. the volume element is
of course invariant under the general three-dimensional dieomorphisms.

the triple product {x , x , x } is also invariant under the vpd. or

more precisely, it transforms as a scalar. namely,

{y , y , y }  {x , x , x } = d(f, g){x , x , x } + o(2)

(13)

for

y = x + d(f, g)x.

(14)

this is due to the the fundamental identity fi-1 which shows that the op-
erator d(f, g) acts as a derivation within the np bracket. for xed f and
g, we can dene a nite transformation by

x(t)  exp(td(f, g))  x =



x

n=0

tn
n!

{f, g, {f, g, {. . . , {f, g, {f, g, x}} . . . , }}}

(15)

3

which satises the nambu equation of motion [1]

d
dt

x(t) = {f, g, x(t)}.

(16)

the nambu-poisson structure is preserved under this evolution equation.

let us now consider the group property of the three-dimensional vpd.

first we derive, using the fi-1

[d(f1, g1), d(f2, g2)]x  {f1, g1, {f2, g2, x}}  {f2, g2, {f1, g1, x}}
= {{f1, g1, f2}, g2, x} + {f2, {f1, g1, g2}, x}.

(17)

the second line, however, does not have manifest antisymmetry under the
interchange 1  2. to understand what this means, we note that the nambu
bracket dened by (4) satises the following identities in addition to the fi-1
as pointed out by hoppe [7]

1. fi-2

2. fi-3

{a[1, a2, {a3, a4], b}} = 0

(18)

{{a1, a2, a3}, a4, b}  {{a2, a3, a4}, a1, b}

+{{a3, a4, a1}, a2, b}  {{a4, a1, a2}, a3, b} = 0.

(19)

here we changed the order of the elements, using skew-symmetry,
from
hoppes original form. it is claimed in [7] that two of the identities fi-1,
fi-2, fi-3 are independent. we wish to show that fi-2 and fi-3 can be
derived from fi-1 and skew-symmetry.

the identity fi-2 and skew-symmetry property enable us to rewrite (17)

as

{{f1, g1, f2}, g2, x} + {f2, {f1, g1, g2}, x} = {{f2, g2, f1}, g1, x}

{f1, {f2, g2, g1}, x}.

(20)

thus we recover the required antisymmetry under 1  2.

however, in our case, the left hand side (l.h.s.) of the rst line in (17) is
antisymmetric by denition, and therefore (20) must hold identically. thus

4

we conclude that the identity (20) is actually a consequence of the original
fundamental identity fi-1, contrary to hoppes statement [7].

note that in going from the rst line to the second line in (17), the
explicit form of the nambu bracket need not be used, nor the property of
skew-symmetry. if the property of skew-symmetry with respect to the rst
two entries is assumed, (20) is equivalent to the fi-3. hence, the fi-2 is also
a consequence of the fi-1.

the algebra of d(f, g) now takes the form

[d(f1, g1), d(f2, g2)] =

1
2(cid:16)d({{f1, g1}, g1}, g2) + d(f2, {f1, g1, g2})

 d({f2, g2, f1}, g1)  d(f1, {f2, g2, g1})(cid:17).

(21)

one important lesson is that the skew-symmetry property (5) is not necessary
for the group structure of the transformations generated by d(f, g). what
is then the role of skew-symmetry from the view point of symmetry? one
obvious fact is that the property of skew-symmetry with respect to the rst
and the second entries means that only the independent part of the two
parameter functions f and g contributes to the transformation, in the sense
that

d(f, g) = d(f + cg, g) = d(f, g + cf )

(22)

for arbitrary constant c.

in the case of the usual poisson structure, the algebra of two-dimensional

area preserving dieomorphisms is given by

where

[d(f1), d(f2)] = d(f3)

f3 = {f1, f2}

d(f )x = {f, x}

(23)

(24)

(25)

formally, the three-dimensional vpd algebra should also be expressible in
the form

[d(f1, g1), d(f2, g2)] = d(f3, g3)

(26)

is it indeed possible to express (f3, g3) in terms of the nambu bracket? it
turns out that the three-dimensional analogue of the commutator algebra

d(a[1)d(a2]) = d({a1, a2})

(27)

5

can be written using the quantum triple nambu commutator [1]

[a, b, c]n  abc  acb + bca  bac + cab  cba

(28)

as follows

or equivalently

d(a[1, a2)d(a3]n , b) = 2d({a1, a2, a3}, b),

(29)

d(b[1, b2)d(a[1, a2)d(a3]n , b3]n ) = 4d({a1, a2, a3}, {b1, b2, b3}). (30)

both relations are equivalent to the fundamental identity

{a1, a2, {a3, b, c}} + {a2, a3, {a1, b, c}} + {a3, a1, {a2, b, c}}

= {{a1, a2, a3}, b, c}

.(31)

this result suggests that there is a new kind of symmetry based on a new
composition law whose innitesimal algebra is given by the triple commuta-
tor (28). as far as we know this type of symmetry has not been observed
previously in the literature. it is tempting to conjecture that this symmetry
is related to the gauge transformations that are not of yang-mills type as in
[8].

3 square matrices and the quantum nambu

brackets

the problem of discretization of p-dimensional volume preserving dieomor-
phisms is related to the issue of quantization of the p-dimensional nambu
bracket. apparently there exists in the literature only one solution of the
quantization problem of nambu brackets which is based on a non-standard
deformation quantization called zariski quantization [4]. the quantum nambu
bracket constructed in [4] is skew-symmetric and obeys both the derivation
property and the fundamental identity. there also exists an example of a
quantum nambu bracket constructed via the same deformation quantization
procedure, which is skew-symmetric and obeys the fundamental identity,
but does not satisfy the derivation property [5].

in this section we wish to give an explicit matrix realization of the quan-
tum nambu bracket, which is skew-symmetric and obeys the fundamental

6

identity. our simple example should be contrasted to the example con-
structed in [5].

what do we mean by a quantum triple nambu bracket? in general we
want an object [f, g, h] which satises properties analogous to the classical
nambu bracket {f, g, h} as listed in the previous section. (here f, g, h are
functions of three variables, and the nature of f, g, h is left open for the
moment.) thus [f, g, h] is expected to satisfy [3], [4], [5], [6]

1. skew-symmetry

[a1, a2, a3] = (1)(p)[ap(1), ap(2), ap(3)],

(32)

where again p(i) is the permutation of indices and (p) is the parity of
the permutation,

2. derivation

[a1a2, a3, a4] = a1[a2, a3, a4] + [a1, a3, a4]a2,

(33)

3. fundamental identity (f.i.)

[[a1, a2, a3], a4, a5] + [a3, [a1, a2, a4], a5]
+[a3, a4, [a1, a2, a5]] = [a1, a2, [a3, a4, a5]].

(34)

(note that the two-dimensional quantum nambu bracket which satises
above properties is just the usual commutator of matrices [a, b]  ab bc.
in this case the f.i. reduces to the jacobi identity.)

first we point out that there exists a matrix realization of the triple
quantum nambu bracket which satises the property of skew-symmetry and
the fundamental identity. to demonstrate this claim we dene a totally
antisymmetric triple bracket of three matrices a, b, c as

[a, b, c]  (tra)[b, c] + (trb)[c, a] + (trc)[a, b].

(35)

then tr[a, b, c] = 0, and if c = 1, [a, b, 1] = n[a, b], where n is the rank
of square matrices.

it is quite easy to prove the fundamental identity now. the f.i. is just

an adjoint action involving matrices x, y, a, b, c

[x, y, [a, b, c]] = [[x, y, a], b, c] + [a, [x, y, b], c] + [a, b, [x, y, c]].

7

using the denition of the triple bracket, the l.h.s. is equal to

(tra)[x, y, [b, c]] + c(a, b, c) = tratrx[y, [b, c]]  tratry [x, [b, c]]
(36)

+c(a, b, c)

where c(a, b, c) denotes the cyclic permutation of a, b, c.

on the other hand, the r.h.s. of the f.i. is equal to

(trx)[[y, a], b, c] + (try )[[a, x], b, c] + (tra)[[x, y ], b, c] + c(a, b, c).
(37)

it is easy to see that

(tra)[[x, y ], b, c] + (trb)[[x, y, ], c, a] + (trc)[[x, y ], a, b] = 0.

(38)

this is because each term is proportional to a product of two traces of the
three matrices a, b, c, and they cancel. for instance, from the rst term
in the above equation we have (tratrb)[c, [x, y ]], while from the second
term we have (trbtra)[[x, y ], c] - the two add up to zero. because of
the above equation, the r.h.s. of the f.i. simplies to (trx)[[y, a], b, c] +
(try )[[a, x], b, c] + c(a, b, c).

we can now see why the l.h.s. is equal to the r.h.s. from both the
l.h.s. and r.h.s. every term upon expansion is proportional to a product
of two traces, one comes from trx or try , another from tra, trb or trc. for
example, on the l.h.s. there is a term

(tratrx)[y, [b, c]],

while from the r.h.s., we nd

(tratrx)([b, [y, c]]  [c, [y, b]]).

this term is equal to the one from the l.h.s. by virtue of the jacobi iden-
tity. the same is true for other terms, simply by doing permutations. this
completes the proof of the fundamental identity.

given our example of a three-dimensional quantum nambu bracket, let

us consider the following gauge transformation

a  i[x, y, a],

(39)

8

where we introduce the factor i, because we take all matrices to be her-
mitian. this transformation represents an obvious quantum form of the
three-dimensional volume preserving dieomorphisms.

by the denition of the triple bracket, the gauge transformation takes the

following explicit form

a = i ([(trx)y  (try )x, a] + (tra)[x, y ])

(40)

where the rst term in the parentheses is just the usual su(n) gauge trans-
formation, and the second term is apparently new.

the rst important property of the gauge transformation, in addition to
satisfying the generalized composition rule (or the f.i.), is that tr(ab) = 0
provided tra = trb = 0. to see this look at

tr(ab) = i[tr([x, y, a]b) + tr([x, y, b]a)]

which in turn is equal to

i[tr([(trx)y  (try )x, a]b) + (a  b)] = 0.

the crucial point is that since tra = 0, the last term in the gauge transfor-
mation (40) is absent, therefore the gauge transformation is just an su(n)
gauge transformation. thus, we have the following general result:

if trai = 0, i = 1, ...n, then

tr(a1a2 . . . an)

(41)

is gauge invariant.

note that the gauge transformation of a commutator does not satisfy the

usual composition rule, namely

[x, y, [a, b]] 6= [[x, y, a], b] + [a, [x, y, b]].

to see this, we only need to realize that the gauge transformation of [a, b] is
just an su(n) transformation, since tr[a, b] = 0. on the other hand, there is
an additional term on the r.h.s. of the above inequality, (tra)[[x, y ], b] +
(trb)[a, [x, y ]].
if tra = trb = 0, then the gauge transformation of the
commutator [a, b] satises the composition rule. similar comments apply
to [[x i, x j], [x l, x k]], since although tr[x i, x j] = 0, [x i, x j] itself does not
satisfy the composition rule.

9

we can also dene a triple quantum nambu bracket involving fermionic
matrices. if there is only one fermionic matrix involved in a triple bracket,
the denition is the same as in (35), and the f.i. identity holds. if there are
two fermionic matrices,  and , dene

[a, , ] = (tra){, } + (tr)[, a] + (tr)[, a],

(42)

where {, } =  + , and tr{, } = 0. due to this property and the
jacobi identity involving fermionic matrices, the f.i. still holds. note that
this triple bracket is symmetric in  and .

if all three matrices are fermionic, we can dene the following fermionic

triple quantum nambu bracket

[, , ] = (tr){, } + (tr){, } + (tr){, }.

(43)

obviously this triple bracket is totally symmetric in three fermionic matrices.
again we can repeat the same steps as before to show that the f.i. holds.

notice that the form of the gauge transformation (40) indicates that a
bosonic hermitian matrix a can be transformed into a form proportional to
the unit n  n matrix as long as tra 6= 0. in other words, since the gauge
transformation is traceless, one can show that a hermitian matrix can be
brought to the following form

a 

1
n

tra1n .

to prove this note that the rst term in (40) represents the usual su(n)
gauge transformation, and it can be used to diagonalize a; the second term
helps to balance all the eigenvalues of a. hence, to diagonalize a rst,
choose x to be a hermitian matrix and y = 1, so that a = in[a, x] -
which is a standard su(n) gauge transformation. once a is diagonalized
this way, choose x, y  su(n), so that the rst term in (40) is absent, and
a = i(tra)[x, y ]. by choosing suitable x and y , we can let [x, y ] be any
element in the cartan algebra of su(n), so that any residual of a in this
cartan algebra can be gauged away, thus proving the above statement.

one nal remark: one might wonder whether there exists a c-number
for our three-dimensional quantum nambu bracket (35), i.e. whether there
exists an element e such that

[e, a, b] = 0

(44)

10

for arbitrary elements a, b? it appears that there is no solution for this
condition except e = 0 for the triple nambu bracket dened above.
notice also that if we consider the triple commutator of the form

[g, a, b]

it follows from the property of skew-symmetry that this bracket is invariant
under a  a + g and b  b + g. in other words, [g, g, b] = [g, a, g] = 0
precisely because of the property of skew-symmetry.

4 cubic matrices and the nambu bracket

in this section we want to address the following question: is there a many-
index matrix representation of the three-dimensional quantum nambu bracket?
for example, the three-dimensional classical nambu bracket is naturally re-
alized in terms of functions of three variables. then it is natural to ask: is it
possible to realize the three-dimensional quantum nambu bracket in terms
of three-index objects aijk (cubic matrices)? it turns out that the answer to
this question is positive. in this section we give some explicit examples of the
three-dimensional quantum nambu bracket written in terms of three-index
objects or cubic matrices.

let us introduce the following generalization of the traces

hai  x

pm

apmp,

habi  x

pqm

apmqbqmp,

habci  x

pqrm

apmqbqmrcrmp,

(45)
which satisfy habi = hbai and habci = hbcai = hcabi. let us fur-
thermore dene a triple-product

(abc)ijk  x

p

aijphbicpjk = x

pqm

aijpbqmqcpjk.

(46)

given this triple-product we dene the following skew-symmetric quantum
nambu bracket

[a, b, c]  (abc) + (bca) + (cab)  (cba)  (acb)  (bac). (47)

the middle index j of aijk can be treated as an internal index for the matrix
realization of the three-dimensional quantum nambu bracket we considered

11

in the previous section. therefore we expect that the f.i. should be satised.
this indeed turns out to be the case. note also that h(abc)i = hbihaci 6=
habci and h(abc)di = hbihacdi.

then by using the following relations

((abc)de) = ((adc)be) = (ab(cde)) = (ad(cbe)),
(a(bcd)e) = (a(dcb)e),

(48)

one can directly prove that the skew-symmetric nambu bracket (47) with the
triple-product (46) obeys the f.i. (34)

the trace habi has the property

h [x, y, a]b i + h a[x, y, b] i = 0,

provided hai = hbi = 0. therefore, since h [a, b, c] i = 0 for any three-
index objects a, b and c, the trace of the product of nambu brackets
h [a, b, c][d, e, f ] i is gauge invariant. notice that if we generalize the
trace (45) as

ha1a2    ani  x

p1,p2,,m

a1

p1mp2a2

p2mp3    an

pnmp1,

n = 1, 2,    ,

(49)

we can also demonstrate that the trace of any product of nambu brackets
h [a, b, c][d, e, f ]    [x, y, z] i is gauge invariant.

let us also dene iijk  (j)
(j)
ik = 1, if i = k, for any j. then

ik , where (j)

ik = 0, if i 6= k, for any j and

(aib) = hii x

p

aijpbpjk,

(iab) = (bai) = haib,

(iai) = hai(j)
ik ,

(iia) = (aii) = hiia,

(50)

and [a, i, b] = pp(aijpbpjk  bijpapjk). hence for any middle index j,
[a, i, b] reduces to the usual commutator [a(j), b(j)] for the matrices a(j)
ik 
aijk and b(j)

ik  bijk.

finally we list other examples of triple-products (abc)ijk which also
satisfy the same relations as eq. (48) and hence lead to the f.i. for the skew-
symmetric nambu bracket (47)

x

pq

aijpbqjqcpjk, x

pqmn

aijpbqmqcpnk, x

pqmn

ainpbqmqcpjk.

(51)

5 generalization: n-dimensional quantum

nambu bracket

we can now generalize and formalize our construction for the n-dimensional
quantum nambu bracket which obeys the n-dimensional fundamental iden-
tity f in:

[x1,    , xn1, [a1,    , an]] =

n

x

i=1

[a1,    , [x1,    , xn1, ai],    , an]. (52)

let ai be operators and let haii be some c-numbers (traces). let
us dene a generalized n-dimensional bracket given an (n  1)-dimensional
bracket as follows:

[a1, a2,    , an] 

n

x

i=1

(1)i1haii[a1,    , ai,    , an].

(53)

here ai stands for the term that is omitted. moreover, let us assume that
the trace hai has the property h [a1,    , an] i = 0. note that if the (n1)-
dimensional bracket is also related to the (n  2)-dimensional bracket with
the same trace hai as in the n-dimensional case, then [a1,    , an] = 0.

by a straightforward computation, one can show that if an (n  1)-
dimensional nambu bracket is skew-symmetric and satises f in1 then the
corresponding n-dimensional bracket is also skew-symmetric and obeys f in
(52).

6 conclusions

in this article we have constructed several explicit examples of the quantum
nambu bracket in terms of square matrices and three-index objects - cubic
matrices. our examples satisfy two crucial properties of the classical nambu
bracket: skew-symmetry and the fundamental identity. our results should
be compared to the existing literature on the deformation quantization ap-
proach to nambu mechanics [5]. we have also discussed the generalization
of our approach to the n-dimensional quantum nambu bracket. notice that
it still remains on open question whether all three properties of the classical

13

nambu bracket - skew-symmetry, derivation and the f.i. - can be realized in
terms of square or cubic matrices.

we wish to conclude this article by outlining a few possible applications
of our formulation. one possible application of our results is in relation
to the yet unknown mathematical structure of the space-time uncertainty
relation in m-theory [9]. there seems to exists a naive similarity between
the form of the space-time uncertainty relation in m-theory and the three-
dimensional quantum nambu bracket [9]. it would be interesting to formulate
this intuitive relation more precisely. also, in view of the fact that space-
time uncertainty principle captures important qualitative features of matrix
theory [10] it would be very interesting to see whether our results could be
relevant for the still unsolved problem of covariantization of matrix theory
[11]. one universal technical aspect of any attempt to covariantize matrix
theory is to promote all spacetime coordinates to matrices, and then to gauge
x a matrix, say the light-cone time matrix, to proportional to the identity
matrix. this demands enlarging the gauge symmetry. our model of nambu
bracket presented in sect. 3 gives rise to gauge symmetry large enough to
achieve this goal.

furthermore, given the fact that the light-cone action for a super p-brane
is invariant under the volume preserving dieomorphisms [8] and given the
obvious relationship between p-dimensional (p  2) volume preserving dif-
feomorphisms and p-dimensional classical nambu brackets [12], [13], [8], we
expect that our results should shed some light on the quantization prob-
lem of p-branes in m-theory and the unknown structure of the non-abelian
antisymmetric tensor gauge theory that emerges in the case when p  3 [8].

we hope to return to some of these problems in the future.

appendix

sucient condition for the f.i.

in this appendix we will give a sucient condition for the f.i. (34). to
nd this, it is worth to recall the classical case: why does the nambu poisson
bracket obey the classical f.i.?

for the usual poisson bracket {a, b} = apbq  bpaq with ap  pa, it

is natural to dene a non-commutative product as (ab)  apbq. then

((ab)c) = apbpqcq + appbqcq,
(a(bc)) = apbpcqq + apbpqcq.

(a.1)

we thus distinguish three kinds of triple-products: apbpqcq, appbqcq and
apbpcqq. the second triple-product is symmetric under the interchange of
bq and cq; the third is symmetric under the interchange of ap and bp.

we can generalize this to the quantum case. let us dene three kinds
of triple-products (abc)m m = 0, 23, 12 which possess symmetries of their
classical counterparts (abc)23 = (acb)23 and (abc)12 = (bac)12. then
a sucient condition for the jacobi identity is

((ab)c) = (abc)0 + (abc)23,
(a(bc)) = (abc)12 + (abc)0.

(a.2)

for the usual square matrices, only one triple-product, (abc)0, is non-zero
and hence the sucient condition is nothing but the property of associativity
((ab)c) = (a(bc)), as expected.

in the case of a three-dimensional nambu bracket, the associativity is
too weak for the f.i., and the corresponding sucient condition turns out
to be more complicated. if we dene the classical nambu triple-product as
(abc)  apbqcr, in analogy with the treatment of the poisson bracket,

15

then

((abc)de) = apbqcprdqer + apbpqcrdqer + appbqcrdqer,
(a(bcd)e) = apbpqcqdrer + apbpcqqdrer + apbpcqdqrer,
(ab(cde)) = apbqcpdqerr + apbqcpdqrer + apbqcprdqer.(a.3)

thus we have to consider six kinds of quintuple-products which possess var-
ious obvious symmetries.

again we can generalize this to the quantum case. let us consider six
kinds of quintuple-product with symmetries analogous to their classical coun-
terparts

(abcde)24 = (adcbe)24,
(abcde)35 = (abedc)35,
(abcde)13 = (cbade)13,

(abcde)24,35 = (adcbe)24,35 = (abedc)24,35,
(abcde)12,45 = (bacde)12,45 = (abced)12,45,
(abcde)13,24 = (cbade)13,24 = (adcbe)13,24.

(a.4)

thus we have found that the sucient condition for the f.i. for the skew-
symmetric nambu bracket (47) is

((abc)de) = (abcde)24 + (abcde)35 + (abcde)24,35,
(a(bcd)e) = (abdce)35 + (abcde)12,45 + (acbde)13,
(ab(cde)) = (abcde)13,24 + (abcde)13 + (abcde)24. (a.5)

note that the condition of associativity ((abc)de) = (a(bcd)e) =
(ab(cde)) does not guarantee the f.i. unlike the case of matrices, where
the jacobi identity is implied by the associativity of the matrix product. the
examples in section 4. are such that only one quintuple-product (abcde)24
is non-zero and (a(bcd)e) is a trivial quintuple-product which implies
(a[bcd]e) = 0.
