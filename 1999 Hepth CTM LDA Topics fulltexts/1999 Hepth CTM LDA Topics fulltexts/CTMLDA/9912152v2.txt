we show how turning on flux for rr (and ns-ns) eld strengths on non-compact

calabi-yau 3-folds can serve as a way to partially break supersymmetry from n = 2 to

n = 1 by mass deformation. the freezing of the moduli of calabi-yau in the presence of

the ux is the familiar phenomenon of freezing of elds in supersymmetric theories upon

mass deformations.

1. introduction

type ii strings compactied on calabi-yau threefolds give rise to n = 2 theories in

4 dimensions. the geometry of calabi-yau threefold and its moduli space provides a deep

insight into the dynamics of n = 2 gauge theories. it is thus natural to ask if the simple

operation of breaking supersymmetry from n = 2 to n = 1 (say by addition of mass

terms) has a calabi-yau counterpart. if so, this may provide insight into the dynamics of

n = 1 gauge theories.

a particular approach to breaking supersymmetry in the context of type ii compact-

ication on calabi-yau threefolds was taken in [1] where ramond-ramond elds strengths

were turned on. it was shown, however, that one either preserves all n = 2 supersymme-

tries (and freeze the moduli of calabi-yau to make it correspond to singular limits such as

the conifold) or one breaks the supersymmetry completely. furthermore it was argued in

[2] that this is a general result.

on the other hand it was found in [3] that in the context of n = 2 quantum eld

theories it is possible to add n = 2 fi terms, and break the supersymmetry to n = 1.

these constructions were generalized to the local case in [4] (see also [5]). there seemed,

therefore, to exist a conict between the results coming from considerations of type ii

compactications on calabi-yau threefolds which suggested nding n = 1 supersymmetric

theories by turning on uxes is not possible, whereas eld theory arguments suggested that

some such deformations should be possible.

we will see in this paper that indeed we can obtain partial supersymmetry breaking by

considering non-compact calabi-yau manifolds with uxes turned on. the way this avoids

the no-go theorem in [2] is by taking a certain decompactication limit, which renders

some elds non-dynamical. in other words, it would have corresponded to a theory with

no supersymmetric vacua in the compact situation, and where it not for making some elds

non-dynamical, we could not have obtained partial supersymmetry breaking. however, as

far as geometric engineering of n = 1 theories are concerned the non-compactness of the

calabi-yau is a perfectly acceptable condition, and this is already the case for geometric

engineering of n = 2 theories.

the organization of this paper is as follows: in section 2 we show how supersymmetry

can be partially broken by considering a simple generalization of models of [3] where we

include two n = 2 vector multiplets. in section 3 we consider type ii compactications

on calabi-yau threefolds and show why turning on rr uxes (and in addition ns ux h

1

for type iib) is equivalent to turning on fi terms in the n = 2 supersymmetric theory.

we also review the no-go theorem of [2] and show how it may be avoided in certain non-

compact limits. in section 4 we briey review aspects of n = 2 geometric engineering and

show how rr ux can give mass to the adjoint eld breaking the theory to n = 1 and

freezing some of the calabi-yau moduli.

main results of this paper have also been obtained by peter mayr [6]. related ideas

have also been considered in [7].

2. partial supersymmetry breaking and mass generation

in this section, we present a simple generalization of the model discussed in [3] which

exhibits partial supersymmetry breaking with mass generation for n = 1 multiplets. it

involves two n = 2 vector multiplets, s and a, with the prepotential

f (s, a) =

i
2

s2 +

1
2

sa2 ,

(2.1)

where  is a real constant, and with the superpotential (which in general can be taken to

be a linear combination of periods)

w = es + mfs = (e + im)s +

m
2

a2 ,

(2.2)

where e = e1 + ie2 and m = m1 + im2 are complex constants and fs = f /s. the
corresponding lagrangian is n = 2 supersymmetric. the constants e and m correspond to

n = 2 electric and magnetic fayet-iliopoulos terms, respectively. in the manifestly n = 2

supersymmetric notation of ref.[3]:

re ~e = (e1 e2 0) ,

~m = (m1 m2 0) .

(2.3)

the superpotential of eq.(2.2) gives rise to the following potential for the scalars

s =  + i and a = b + ia :

v =

| ea  mb |2
(  a2)

.

(2.4)

in the above equation, we neglected an irrelevant, additive constant term. the potential

has a zero-value minimum at a = b = 0. for generic values of e and m, both n = 2

supersymmetries are broken spontaneously. there are, however, two special congurations

of these parameters:

e  im = 0 ,

2

(2.5)

for which supersymmetry is broken partially to n = 1. in this case, both scalars a and b,

as well as the fermionic component of the n = 1 chiral multiplet a acquire an equal mass

of |m|/. the simplest way to prove formally that such a partial breaking does indeed

occur is to follow the method of [3] and examine the supersymmetry variations of fermions.

in this way, one can identify the n = 2  n = 1 goldstino as one of the two fermionic

components (gauginos) of the s multiplet. in fact, the full n = 2 vector multiplet s and

the n = 1 vector component of a remain massless while the n = 1 chiral multiplet a

acquires a mass.

the above model can be generalized to more complicated prepotentials, of the form

f (s, a) = f (s) +

1
2

sa2.

(2.6)

as in the previous case, the potential has a minimum at a = 0. however, there is also

another minimization, with respect to s, which yields two solutions

e + mfss = 0

or

e + m f s s = 0 ,

(2.7)

similar to (2.5). it is easy to see that the above equation is exactly the condition for partial

supersymmetry breaking. hence we conclude that an n = 1 supersymmetric vacuum exists

also in the general case. in particular, the mass |m|/ is generated again for the n = 1

chiral multiplet a.

so far we have been discussing the case of global n = 2 supersymmetry.

in the

context of string theory we of course have local n = 2 supersymmetry. in such a case to

obtain n = 2 global limit we have to take some particular limit, where gravity decouples,

say by taking in the type ii context weak limit of string coupling constant, and perhaps

some other limits for other elds. in this context we can break n = 2 to n = 1 in an even

simpler way. set  = 0, so that the prepotential is just

f =

1
2

sa2

this would have given a singular kinetic term for s in the global case, but it is perfectly

ne in the local case. we can think of s for example as the heterotic string coupling
constant. we now turn on fi term fs + fa. we take the limit where the vev of s
becomes large (i.e. weak coupling heterotic string limit). in this limit s becomes non-
dynamical. and the superpotential term w = 1
2 m(a)2 (where a is related to a by a
shift) simply gives mass to the scalar a, breaking n = 2 to n = 1. it is this realization

of partial supersymmetry breaking that we will nd applicable in the calabi-yau context

later in this paper.

3. type iib on calabi-yau 3-fold with h-ux

consider compactication of type iib on a calabi-yau threefold. we would like to
consider turning on ux for ns and r threeform eld strengths h n s and h r. this is a

case already considered in [2] following the work of [1] and more recently from the viewpoint
of f-theory in [8,9]. the theory has h2,1 vector multiplets and h1,1 + 1 hypermultiplets
in addition to the n = 2 gravitational multiplet, where hp,q denotes hodge numbers of

calabi-yau. the relevant modication to the eective action due to turning on h-ux is

in interactions with the vector multiplets. let  denote the holomorphic threeform on the

calabi-yau. we write the eective lagrangian we obtain in 4 dimensions in an n = 1

supersymmetric framework. the net eect of turning on h-ux is to add a superpotential

of the form

w =z   ( h n s + h r)

(3.1)

in the 4-dimensional eective theory, where  denotes the complexied coupling constant
of type iib strings. note that h n s and h r are dual to some integral 3-cycles cn s and
cr and the above formula can also be written as

w =z cn s +cr



to see how (3.1) arises note that if we consider a ve brane (ns or r) wrapped around a

3-cycle c in the calabi-yau, it corresponds to a domain wall in 3+1 dimensional theory,

whose bps bound for tension should be given by w across the domain wall. on the

other hand the tension of the 5-brane should be rc  (times  in the case of ns 5-brane).

since the 5-brane wrapped around c changes the h ux across the domain wall by a

3-form dual to the c cycle we see that this gives the expected change w . this argument

was discussed in [8] in the context of f-theory on 4-folds, and type iib on calabi-yau

3-folds is a special case of it.

we can also write (3.1) explicitly if we choose a basis for h3(m, z), given by (a, b),
,  = 0, ..., h2,1, with a  a = b  b = 0 and a  b = 
. sometimes we refer to
a as the electric cycles and b as the magnetic cycles. this clearly is a basis dependent
denition. let

x  =za



f =zb



moreover denote the dual 3-cycle to the h-uxes by

 c n s + c r = ea + mb

4

where

c n s = e1

a + m1b

c r = e2

a + m2b ,

(3.2)

and the complex vectors e and m are dened as:

e = e1

 + e2


m = m1 + m2 .

(3.3)

the superpotential (3.1) can be written explicitly as

w =zcr

 + zcn s

 = ex  + mf

(3.4)

as is well known there is a prepotential f (x), a homogeneous function of weight 2 in x

in terms of which

f = f .

thus the fi terms are realized by h uxes in type iib string compactication on calabi-

yau threefolds.

3.1. type iia version

the same analysis can be done in the type iia language (for the case of type iia on

calabi-yau 4 folds see [10]). in fact mirror symmetry already tells us what the story will

be in the type iia case. the story is much simpler in the context of just turning on the

h r ux. in this case the mirror corresponds to turning on f 2, f 4 and f 6 uxes which

are dual to 4, 2 and 0 cycles on calabi-yau 3-fold. the analog of (3.1) is now

w = n0 +zc2

k +zc4

k2

where k denotes the kahler class on the calabi-yau threefold and n0 denotes the quantum

of f 6 ux. the above formula receives world sheet instanton correction as is well known,

and in fact by mirror symmetry one can recover the instanton corrected superpotential w

on the calabi-yau.

5

3.2. scalar potential

our next step is to obtain the scalar potential corresponding to the superpotential

(3.4). we would like to maintain a manifest n = 2 supersymmetry, however this is not

possible in the locally supersymmetric case because the superpotential is a genuinely n = 1

quantity. instead of turning to the fully-edged n = 2 supersymmetric formalism [11] (like

in ref.[2]), we can try to obtain the potential by compactifying the 10-dimensional action.

alas, this is not so simple in view of the absence of a fully covariant, o-shell formulation

of type iib supergravity. the best we can do is to start from the non-self-dual (nsd)

action [12] employing a 4-form eld strength which is not self-dual. the equations of

motion of iib supergravity follow from the nsd action after imposing the self duality

constraint at the level of eld equations. using the nsd action to determine the scalar

potential is somewhat questionable, nevertheless it is interesting to compare the result

with the superpotential (3.4). in fact, this method will provide an independent derivation

of (3.4).

in order to parameterize the h-uxes, we will use the h 3(m, z) basis (, ), dual

to the (a, b) basis of h3(m, z), with r    = 

 , r    = r    = 0.

the uxes can be written as

h n s = e1

 + m1 ,

h r = e2

 + m2 .

(3.5)

in the presence of the uxes, the 10-dimensional kinetic terms give rise to the potential:

v = (2im )1z ( h n s + h r)  ( h n s + h r).

(3.6)

the integration over the calabi-yau manifold can be performed by using standard prop-
erties of (, ) basis (see e.g. [13,14]), with the result

v = (2im )1[m(imn ) m + (e + mren )(imn )1(e + mren )] ,

(3.7)

where n is the period matrix [14] while e and m are the complex vectors dened in (3.3).

the potential can be rewritten as

v = (2im )1[(e + m n )(imn )1(e + mn )] + m  e ,

where the constant term

m  e  m1e2

  m2e1
 .

6

(3.8)

(3.9)

as we will discuss in the next subsection m and e should be chosen so that m  e is zero

(for cancellation of 3-brane tadpoles), which we will assume is the case.

in order to relate the above potential with the superpotential (3.4), we rst use the

identity [14]:

ek(z,z)(imn )1 = 2 x x   2dix  gi d x  ,

(3.10)

where k is the kahler potential of the n = 2 vector multiplet moduli zi, i = 1, . . . , h2,1,
and gi is the inverse metric on the vector moduli space. the above expression contains

the kahler covariant derivatives:

dix  = (i + ki)x .

by using the relations

nx  = f ,

ndix  = dif

we can rewrite the potential as

v = e[k(z,z)+ek(, )](cid:2)gidiw dw + eg  d w d w(cid:3),

where w is the superpotential (3.4). the dilaton kahler potential

 ln[(   )/2i] and accordingly,

d w = ( + ek )w ,

  = (   )2.

eg  = ek 1

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

is ek(,  ) =

(3.14)

eq.(3.13) is very similar to the standard n = 1 supergravity formula for the potential.
however, it is not exactly the same: for instance, the 3|w |2 term is missing. this appar-

ent discrepancy has a simple explanation. although the superpotential does not depend

on hypermultiplets, except on the dilaton  , the potential receives contributions from the
kahler covariant derivatives1 with respect to chiral components of all hypermultiplets, in-
cluding the calabi-yau volume etc. all these contributions are proportional to |w |2 and
must cancel the 3|w |2 term. the coecient 3 is related to the fact that the 4d coupling

is rescaled by the volume of the internal calabi-yau threefold.

now we consider the rigid supersymmetry limit of (3.13) and (3.4). the weyl rescaling

of the metric that restores the planck mass mp l in the action introduces the factors m 2

p l in

1 for simplicity, we assume here that the quaternionic hypermultiplet manifold is kahler.

7

front of the ricci scalar r and scalar kinetic terms; the potential acquires a factor of m 4

p l.
gravity decouples in the mp l   limit and the only scalars surviving as dynamical elds
are those with the kahler metric  m 2
p l ; all other scalars freeze and can be treated
as constant parameters. in order to recover the globally supersymmetric models of the

type discussed in section 2 and in ref.[3] from type iib theory with h-uxes, we scale
the holomorphic sections as (x 0, f0)  1 and (x , f)  m 1
p l ,  > 0. the kahler
potential k(z, z) scales then as m 2
p l , so the vector moduli survive as dynamical elds
in the mp l   limit while  and other hypermultiplets decouple and can be treated
as (complex) parameters. furthermore, we set e0 = m0 = 0 and adjust the remaining
fayet-iliopoulos parameters so that the superpotential (3.4) scales as m 3
p l . in this way
[11], we obtain from (3.13) a nite potential corresponding to the rigid superpotential
w = eizi + mifi [3]. the procedure of taking the rigid limit can be further rened to

treat some vector moduli in a special way (such as the s eld discussed in the previous

section), in order to freeze them in a way similar to  . this will be useful in the context

of geometric engineering of n = 1 theories, to be discussed in the next section.

3.3. supersymmetric vacua

now we analyze supersymmetric solutions with superpotential given by (3.4). the
condition for getting a supersymmetric solution with r4 background in this context has

been studied by [2] with the conclusion that either there are no supersymmetric vacua

or that the n = 2 is preserved at the vacua.

in particular no n = 1 supersymmetric

vacua were found in this way. let us review these results in the n = 1 setup that we are
considering. the condition for nding supersymmetric vacua in r4 background is that

w = dw = 0

where dw denotes the derivative of w with respect to all chiral elds.
in the context
of compact calabi-yau, considered in [2], turning on both h n s and h r can preserve

supersymmetry only if

z h n s  h r  m  e = 0.

(3.15)

otherwise these uxes induce anti-3-brane charge in the uncompactied spacetime (pro-

portional to r h n s  h r) and to cancel it we will necessarily break supersymmetry. if

h n s and h r satisfy (3.15) then we can choose both of them be dual to some a-cycles (i.e.

8

m=0). if we denote the dual three cycles by n1a1 and n2a2 with periods rai

superpotential will take the form,

 = xi the

w = n1 x1 + n2x2.

the condition that w = dw = 0 in terms of physical elds zi = xi/x0, is equivalent to

dw = 0 in terms of the xi variables. since x1 and x2 are independent elds, we see that

condition dw/dx1 = dw/dx2 = 0 has no solutions, and so supersymmetry is completely

broken.

so we see that if we consider smooth calabi-yau manifolds there are no supersym-

metric solutions. however, near singular calabi-yau manifolds the low energy eective

lagrangian description breaks down and one could have additional light elds. the par-

ticular case of conifold was studied in [1]. in that case, say we have a vanishing a cycle,

and we turn on a ux dual to that cycle. this means we have a superpotential

w = a

a light wrapped d3 brane which in n = 1 language corresponds to chiral elds  and

where a =ra  and  = n1 + n2 . let us set n2 = 0. if a is shrinking we have in addition
e with charge 1 respectively under the u (1) gauge eld whose supersymmetric scalar

partner has vev hi = a. so the actual lagrangian superpotential should be modied to

now the condition that w = dw = 0 has a solution and is given by

w = a + ae

a = 0

e = 

in fact it is possible to check that this actually preserves the full n = 2 supersymmetry.

even though some other singularities of calabi-yau manifolds have also been considered

in [2] none has been shown to lead to n = 1 unbroken supersymmetry (though a full no-go

theorem is not available in this context).

9

3.4. how to obtain n = 1 supersymmetry?

it thus seems dicult to obtain an n = 1 supergravity solution with h-ux turned

on for compact calabi-yau manifolds. how could we possibly relax some conditions to

make this possible? the hint comes from considering n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills

theories. in these cases one expects to have a mass gap with some number of vacua c2(g)

given by the dual coxeter number of the group. moreover one can assign a superpotential

to each vacuum given by

wk = kexp(s/c2(g))

where s = 1/g2 and k is an c2(g) root of unity. the meaning of this superpotential is that

the domain walls stretched going from one vacuum to the other will have a central terms

for their tension given by the dierence of the corresponding values of the superpotential.

in the usual n = 1 yang-mills the coupling constant s is not a eld but a parameter. but

we can actually promote it to a chiral eld whose vev is given by the coupling constant.

if we do that, then we will also have to consider dwk/ds = 0 for nding supersymmetric

ground states, otherwise we would get a positive energy given by

gs s|swk|2

where gs s is the inverse to the kahler metric for s. however, dwk/ds = 0 has no solutions,

which means that we have no supersymmetric vacuum (or any vacuum in this case). but

clearly we can embed the usual n = 1 gauge theory in this theory, simply by taking the

kinetic term for s eld to be very large and thus eectively freezing it (this corresponds
to making gs s vanishing and thus giving no energy to the vacuum). note in this case that

even if s is treated as a parameter the vacuum has an energy and so the supersymmetric

background makes sense if we decouple the gravity, by taking mp l  . this is in fact

how we will generate n = 1 qfts by turning on h-uxes; namely, as we will see later,

the eld s will play the role of an extra eld, whose dynamics we will freeze in the limit

of interest and concentrate on a decoupling limit where gravity is irrelevant. this will in

particular avoid the no-go theorem of [2] for obtaining n = 1 solutions .

10

4. geometric engineering for n = 2 theories and their partial breaking to

n = 1

in preparation of our discussion for turning on rr-uxes and breaking n = 2 theories

to n = 1 we rst review some relevant aspects of geometric engineering for n = 2 gauge

theories, in the context of type iia compactication on calabi-yau threefold and its type

iib mirror (see [15-18] for more detail). instead of being general, consider a simple example:

let us review how the su (2) yang-mills is geometrically engineered: we consider in type
iia a local cy geometry where a p 1 is bered over another p 1. the simplest possibility is
f  p 1
p 1
f goes to zero we obtain an enhanced su (2) gauge symmetry
from the a1 singularity. to suppress the gravity eects we take gs  0. the area of p 1
b ,
s, determines the coupling constant for the su (2) gauge theory:

b . in the limit the p 1

s =

1
g2

we can identify the size of p 1
precisely, we have the classical relation that

f , a, with the vev of a scalar in the adjoint of su (2); more

a2 = ht r2i.

b and zero size p 1

one considers the regime where s is large and a is small. this is the same as taking a
nite size p 1
f in the string frame in the limit where gs  0 (the eective
mass of d2 branes is given by a = a/gs and s = s /gs where the a and s  denote the
volume of the p 1s in the string frame). in this limit the eld s becomes non-dynamical
and plays only the role of a parameter in the eld theory. the n = 2 prepotential in this

case has the following structure

f =

1
2

sa2 + a2loga2 +xn

cna24nexp(ns)

(4.1)

for some constants cn. note that s can be absorbed into a redenition of a. in fact this
is the limit one is taking in the geometry, namely we take a  0 and s   keeping the
combination a4exps xed. the way this expression is obtained is to use mirror symmetry
to compute the worldsheet instanton corrections in this type iia background by relating

it to complex structure variation in a type iib background. physically, the net result is

that the apparent instanton corrections in (4.1) can be related to one loop corrections to
the prepotential summed over all d2 branes wrapped around the p 1  p 1 geometry. in
other words

f = sa2 + xbp s m

m2logm2

and the rich structure of the instanton corrections gets mapped to an intricate structure

of wrapped bps d2 branes in this geometry, in the limit we are taking.

11

4.1. adding the flux and breaking n = 2  n = 1

now we are ready to add the ux. we choose the ux to be an rr 2-form ux in

the direction dual to the 2-cycle p 1

b . this means according to our discussion in section 3,

generating a superpotential given by

w =

f
s

in the context of type iib it means turning on a specic rr h-ux dual to the 3-cycle

representing s. in that context f/s is a classical computation of periods. now, it has

been shown [19] that

f
s

= constant  u

where u = htr2i, and the classical result u = a2 receives quantum correction exactly as
given by u = constant  f

s . in particular, not just a, but also u itself is among the periods
of the type iib calabi-yau geometry (this was a crucial fact for extracting gauge theory

implication of type iib geometry [15]). we thus have a superpotential

w = constant  u

this can be viewed in the gauge theory language as a mass deformation (giving mass to the

scalar partner  of the vector multiplet) breaking n = 2  n = 1. to nd whether there

are any supersymmetric vacua one will have to analyze it, exactly as was done originally

in the eld theory context by seiberg and witten [20]. namely one nds near the points

where there is a massless dyon, a modication of the superpotential, by including the light

states. in this case we get (somewhat analogous to the conifold case)

and one nds an n = 1 supersymmetric solution

w = mu + (ad  a0)e

u
ad

e = m

ad = a0

in the type iib context this corresponds to freezing some complex moduli of calabi-yau

threefold and rendering some other moduli non-dynamical.

12

4.2. generalizations

it is clear that this generalizes to a large number of n = 2 gauge models engineered

in [18] (at least for the cases where the beta function is not zero). just as was done above

for the su (2) case, one turns on in the type iia context independent rr 2-form ux in

the bases whose sizes control the coupling constants of various gauge groups. by going
over to its type iib mirror, the rr ux turns into a particular h r ux, which again serve

to freeze the moduli in the type iib side, exactly as was done for the su (2) case above.
