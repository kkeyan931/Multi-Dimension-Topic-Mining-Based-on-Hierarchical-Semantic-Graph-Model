abstract

we formulate an eective schrodinger wave equation describing the quan-
tum dynamics of a system of d0-branes by applying the wilson renormal-
ization group equation to the worldsheet partition function of a deformed
-model describing the system, which includes the quantum recoil due to the
exchange of string states between the individual d-particles. we arrive at
an eective fokker-planck equation for the probability density with diusion
coecient determined by the total kinetic energy of the recoiling system. we
use galilean invariance of the system to show that there are three possible
solutions of the associated non-linear schrodinger equation depending on the
strength of the open string interactions among the d-particles. when the open
string energies are small compared to the total kinetic energy of the system,
the solutions are governed by freely-propagating solitary waves. when the
string coupling constant reaches a dynamically determined critical value, the
system is described by minimal uncertainty wavepackets which describe the
smearing of the d-particle coordinates due to the distortion of the surrounding
spacetime from the string interactions. for strong string interactions, bound
state solutions exist with eective mass determined by an energy-dependent
shift of the static bps mass of the d0-branes.

i. introduction and summary

despite the enormous amount of activity over the past few years towards understanding
the dynamics of dirichlet p-branes [1], the problem of demonstrating that a system of n
moving d-particles can form a bound state is still unresolved. it is relevant to the matrix

theory conjecture [2] in which these particles are interpreted as kaluza-klein modes of 11-
dimensional m-theory compactied on a circle and are described by the supersymmetric
n  n matrix quantum mechanics that is obtained from dimensional reduction of n = 1
supersymmetric yang-mills theory in ten dimensions. the existence of such a tower of states

is equivalent to the statement that the quantum mechanics admits exactly one bound state
for each n. the original threshold bound state problem was addressed in [3] and recent

progress has been made in [4]. however, beyond the proof of existence in the case n = 2, the
general case n > 2 remains in large part an open problem. in this paper we shall address
the bound state problem for a system of n non-relativistic, recoiling d0-branes by studying

their moduli space dynamics in certain limits.

the eective worldvolume dynamics of a single dp-brane coupled to a worldvolume gauge

eld and to background supergravity elds is described by the action [1]

idp = tpz dp+1 er det

,

[g + b + 2f] + tpz dp+1 hc  e2f +b  gip+1

(1.1)

the rst term in (1.1) is the dirac-born-infeld action with tp the p-brane tension,  the
string regge slope,  the dilaton eld, f = da the worldvolume eld strength, and g and b

the pull-backs of the target space metric and neveu-schwarz two-form elds, respectively, to
the dp-brane worldvolume. it is a generalization of the geometric volume of the brane tra-

jectory. the second term is the wess-zumino action (restricted to its p + 1-form component)
with c the pullback of the sum over all electric and magnetic ramond-ramond (rr) form
potentials and g a geometrical factor accounting for the possible non-trivial curvature of the
tangent and normal bundles to the p-brane worldvolume. it describes the coupling of the
dp-brane to the supergravity rr p + 1-form elds as well as to the topological charge of the

worldvolume gauge eld and to the worldvolume gravitational connections. the fermionic
completion of the action (1.1), compatible with spacetime supersymmetry and worldvolume

-symmetry, has been described in [5]. for a recent review of the born-infeld action and its
various extensions in superstring theory, see [6].

while the generalization of the wess-zumino lagrangian to multiple dp-branes is obvious
(one simply traces over the worldvolume gauge group in the fundamental representation),
the complete form of the non-abelian born-infeld action is not known. in [7] it was proposed

2

that the background independent terms can be derived using t -duality from a 9-brane action
obtained from the corresponding abelian version by symmetrizing all gauge group traces in

the vector representation [6]. a direct calculation of the leading terms in a weak supergravity
background has been calculated using matrix theory methods in [8]. based on the type i

formulation, i.e. by viewing a d-particle in the neumann picture and imposing t -duality
as a functional canonical transformation in the string path integral [9], the eective moduli

space lagrangian was derived in [10] and shown to coincide (to leading orders in a velocity
expansion) with the non-abelian born-infeld action of [7]. in the following we will use this

moduli space approach to d-brane dynamics to describe some properties of the multiple
d-brane wavefunction.

the novel aspect of the approach of [10] is that the moduli space dynamics induces

an eective target space geometry for the d-branes which contains information about the
short-distance spacetime structure probed by multiple d-particles. based on this feature,

string-modied spacetime and phase space uncertainty relations can be derived and thereby
represent a proper quantization of the noncommutative spacetime seen by low-energy d-

particle probes [11]. the crucial property of the derivation is the incorporation of proper
recoil operators for the d-branes and the short open string excitations connecting them. the
smearing of the spacetime coordinates ya
i (in general i = 1, . . . , 9  p label the transverse
coordinates of the dp-brane and a = 1, . . . , n the component branes of the multiple d-brane
conguration) of a given d-particle as a result from its open string interactions with other

branes can be seen directly from the formula for the variance

(ya

(1.2)

i

where y ab
are the u(n)-valued positions of the d-particles (a = b) and of the open strings
connecting branes a and b (a 6= b), and in is the n n identity matrix. the recoil operators
give a relevant deformation of the conformal eld theory describing free open strings, and
thus lead to non-trivial renormalization group ows on the moduli space of coupling con-

stants. the moduli space dynamics is thereby governed by the zamolodchikov metric and
the associated c-theorem. physically, the recoil operators describe the appropriate change of
quantum state of the d-brane background after the emission or absorption of open or closed

strings. they are a necessary ingredient in the description of multiple d-brane dynamics,
in which coincident branes interact with each other via the exchange of open string states.

the quantum uncertainties derived in [10,11] were found to exhibit quantum decoherence
eects through their dependence on the recoil energies of the system of d-particles. this

suggests that the appropriate quantum dynamics of d0-branes should be described by some
sort of stochastic string eld theory involving a fokker-planck hamiltonian.

3

as in [6,7], the derivation in [10] assumes constant background supergravity elds. how-
ever, another important ingredient missing in the moduli space description are the appro-

priate residual fermionic terms from the supersymmetry of the initial static d-brane cong-
uration. while the recoil of the d-branes breaks supersymmetry, it is necessary to include

these terms to have a complete description of the stability of the d-particle bound state.
as shown in [12], the energy of the bound states of d-branes and strings is determined by

the central charge of the corresponding spacetime supersymmetry algebra. nonetheless, the
bosonic formalism that we display below can be exploited to a large extent to describe at

least heuristically the quantum phase structure of the multiple d-particle system and, in
particular, determine the mass and stability conditions of the candidate bound state. one
reason that this approach is expected to yield reliable results is that we view the system

of d-branes and strings as a quantum mechanical system (rather than a quantum eld
theoretical system as might be the case from the fact that t -duality is used to eectively

integrate over the transverse coordinates of the branes), with the d-brane recoil constituting
an excitation of this system. the recoiling system of d-branes and strings can be viewed

as an excited state of a supersymmetric (static) vacuum conguration. the breaking of
target space supersymmetry by the excited state of the system may thereby constitute a
symmetry obstruction situation in the spirit of [13]. according to the symmetry obstruction

hypothesis, the ground state of a system of (static) strings and d-branes is a bps state, but
the excited (recoiling) states do not respect the supersymmetry due to quantum diusion

and other eects. phenomenologically, the supersymmetry breaking induced by the excited
system of recoiling d-particles will distort the spacetime surrounding them and may result

in a decohering spacetime foam, on which low energy (point-like) excitations live. this mo-
tivates the study of non-supersymmetric d-branes recoiling under the exchange of strings.

such quantum mechanical systems exhibit diusion and may be viewed as non-equilibrium
(open) quantum systems, with the non-equilibrium state being related naturally to the pic-
ture of viewing the recoiling d-brane system as an excited state of some (non-perturbative)

supersymmetric d-brane vacuum conguration.

the main relationship we shall exploit in obtaining the quantum dynamics of multiple

d-particle systems is that between the dirichlet partition function in the background of
type ii string elds and the semi-classical (euclidean) wavefunctional [y i] of a dp-brane.
this relation is usually expressed as [14,15]

z =z dy i [y i]

(1.3)

the wavefunction [y i] is expressed in terms of the generating functional which sums up all
one-particle irreducible connected worldsheet diagrams whose boundaries are mapped onto
the d-brane worldvolume. integration over the worldvolume gauge eld is implicit in  to

4

ensure type ii winding number conservation. dirichlet string perturbation theory yields

[y i] = exp

xh=1

e(h2) sh[y i]

(1.4)

where sh denotes the amplitude with h holes, in which an implicit sum over handles is as-
sumed. however, as we will discuss in the following, the identication (1.3) is not the only

one consistent with the approach to d-brane dynamics advocated in [10], and one may in-
stead identify the worldsheet dirichlet partition function, summed over all genera, with the

probability distribution corresponding to the wavefunction . using this identication, the
wilson renormalization group equation has been proposed as a dening principle for obtain-

ing string eld equations of motion, including the appropriate fischler-susskind mechanism
for the contributions from higher genera [14]. when applied to dirichlet string theory, we

shall nd that the consistent d-brane equation of motion follows from the renormalization
group equation.

more precisely, within the framework of a perturbative logarithmic conformal eld the-

ory approach to multiple d-brane dynamics [10], we will show that the intricate quantum
dynamics of a system of interacting d-particles is described by a non-linear schrodinger

wave equation. the corresponding probability density is of the fokker-planck type, with
quantum diusion coecient d given by the square of the modulus of the recoil velocity
matrix of the bound state system of d-particles and strings:

d = cg 
where cg is a numerical constant and u i
ab is the (renormalized) constant velocity matrix of
a system of n d-particles arising due to the d-particle recoil from the scattering of string

tr| u i|2

9xi=1

(1.5)

states. this phenomenon is in fact characteristic of liouville string theory, on which the
above approach is based. since the d-particle interactions distort their surrounding space-

time, these non-linear structures may be thought of as describing short-distance quantum
gravitational properties of the d-brane spacetime. non-linear equations of motion for string

eld theories have been derived in other contexts in [16]. from this nonlinear schrodinger
dynamics we shall describe a multitude of classes of solutions, using galilean invariance of
the d-brane dynamics which is a consequence of the corresponding logarithmic conformal al-
gebra. we will show that bound state solutions do indeed exist for string couplings gs larger
than a dynamically determined critical value. the eective bound state mass is likewise

determined as an energetically induced shift of the static, bps mass of the d0-branes. in
fact, we shall nd that there are essentially three dierent phases of the quantum dynamics

in string coupling constant space. below the critical string coupling the multiple d-brane

5

wavefunction is described by solitary waves, in agreement with the description of free d-
branes as string theoretic solitons, while at the critical coupling the quantum dynamics

is described by coherent gaussian wavepackets which determine the appropriate quantum
smearing of the multiple d-particle spacetime. these results are shown to be in agreement

with the previous results concerning the structure of quantum spacetime [10,11].

we close this section by summarizing some of the generic guidelines that we shall use in

this paper for constructing a wavefunctional for the system of d-branes. we will use a eld
theoretic approach by identifying the hartle-hawking wavefunction

0  ese

(1.6)

where se is the eective euclidean action. we shall discuss the extension to string theory
and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of using this identication. we shall also
identify the probability density with the genus expansion of an appropriate worldsheet -

model:

p = 00 = xgeneraz dx es[x]

(1.7)

the arguments in favour of this identication will be reality, and the occurence of statistical

probability distribution factors which appear in the wormhole parameters after resummation
of (1.7) over pinched genera. the wilson-polchinski worldsheet renormalization group ow,

coming from the sum over genera as in (1.7), yields a fokker-planck diusion equation

tp = d 2p    j

(1.8)

where d is the diusion operator dened in (1.5) in terms of (renormalized) recoil velocity
matrices, and j is the associated probability current density. the equation (1.8) will follow
from the gradient ow property of the -model -functions, which is also necessary for the
helmholtz conditons or equivalently for canonical quantization of the string moduli space.
the knowledge of the fokker-planck equation (1.8) alone does not lead to an unambigu-

ous construction of the wavefunction . there are ambiguities associated with non-linear
-dependent phase transformations of the wavefunction:

 7 ein,() 

n,() =  log || +  arg  + (cid:16){y ab

i }, t(cid:17)

(1.9)

where t is the liouville zero mode. furthermore,  is then necessarily determined by a
non-linear wave equation if a diusion coecient d is present, as will be the case in what
follows. the non-linear schrodinger equation has the form

6

ih t = h0 +



(1.10)

ih

2 d 2p
p

where p =  is the probability density. this is a galilean-invariant but time-reversal
violating equation, exactly as expected from previous considerations of non-relativistic d-
brane dynamics and liouville string theory. eq. (1.10) will be the proposal in the following

for the non-linear quantum dynamics of matrix d-branes (this was noted in passing in [17]).

ii. quantum mechanics on moduli space

in [10] it was shown how a description of non-abelian d-particle dynamics, based on
canonical quantization of a -model moduli space induced by the worldsheet genus expansion

(i.e. the quantum string theory), yields quantum uctuations of the string soliton collective
coordinates and hence a microscopic derivation of spacetime uncertainty relations, as seen by

short distance d-particle probes. in the following we will proceed to construct a wavefunction
for the system of d0-branes which encodes the pertinent quantum dynamics. to start, in
this section we shall clarify certain facts about wavefunctionals in non-critical string theories

in general, completing the discussion put forward in [15].

a. liouville-dressed renormalization group flows

consider quite generally a non-critical string -model, dened as a deformation of a

conformal eld theory s with coupling constants {gi}. the worldsheet action is

s[x;{gi}] = s[x] +z

d2z givi[x]

(2.1)

where vi are the deformation vertex operators and an implicit sum over repeated upper and
lower indices is always understood. we assume that the deformation is relevant, so that the
worldsheet theory must be dressed by two-dimensional quantum gravity in order to restore

conformal invariance in the quantum string theory. the corresponding liouville-dressed
renormalized couplings {i} satisfy the renormalization group equations

i + q i = i()

(2.2)

where the dots denote dierentiation with respect to the worldsheet zero mode of the liou-
ville eld. here q is the square root of the running central charge decit on moduli space

and

i() = hii + ci

jkj k + . . .

(2.3)

7

are the at worldsheet -functions, expressed in terms of liouville-dressed coupling con-
stants. in (2.3), hi are the conformal dimensions and ci
jk the operator product expansion
coecients of the vertex operators vi. the minus sign in (2.2) owes to the fact that we con-
ne our attention here to the case of central charge c > 25 (corresponding to supercritical

bosonic or fermionic strings).

upon interpreting the liouville zero mode as the target space time evolution parameter,

eq. (2.2) is reminescent of the equation of motion for the inaton eld  in inationary
cosmological models [18,19]. in the present case of course one has a collection of elds {gi},
but the analogy is nevertheless precise. the role of the hubble constant h is played by the
central charge decit q. the precise correspondence actually follows from the gradient ow
property of the string -model -functions for at worldsheets:

i = gij 

gj c

(2.4)

where c = q2 is the zamolodchikov c-function which is associated with the generating
functional for one-particle irreducible correlation functions [20], and gij is the matrix inverse
of the zamolodchikov metric

gij = 2|z|4 hvi(z, z) vj(0, 0)i

(2.5)

on the moduli space m({gi}) of -model couplings {gi}. then the right-hand side of (2.2)
also corresponds to the gradient of the potential v in inationary models:

 + 3h  = 

dv
d

(2.6)

where  is the inaton eld in a suciently homogeneous domain of the universe.

b. the hartle-hawking wavefunction

in [10,15] it was shown, through the energy dependence of quantum uncertainties, that
some sort of stochasticity characterizes non-critical liouville string dynamics, implying that

the analogy of eq. (2.2) with the equations of motion in inationary models should be made
with those involving chaotic ination [19]. let us now briey review the properties of these

latter models. in such cases, the ground state wavefunction of the universe may be identied
as [21]:

0(a, ) = exp se(a, )

(2.7)

where se is the euclidean action for the scalar eld a( ) and the inaton scalar eld ( )
which satisfy the boundary conditions:

8

a(0) = a

,

(0) = 

(2.8)

and  is the euclidean time.

to understand how eq. (2.7) comes about, we appeal to the hartle-hawking interpreta-
tion [21]. consider the greens function hx, t|0, ti of a particle which propagates from the
spacetime point (0, t) to (x, t):

hx, t|0, ti =xn

n(x)n(0) eien(tt) =z dx eis(x,|tt|)

(2.9)

where {n} is the complete set of energy eigenstates with energy eigenvalues en  0 (the
sum in (2.9) should be replaced by an appropriate integration in the case of a continuous

spectrum). to obtain an expression for the ground state wavefunction, we make a wick
rotation t = i , and take the limit    to recover the initial state. then in the
summation over energy eigenvalues in (2.9), only the ground state (n = 0) term survives
if e0 = 0. the corresponding path integral representation becomes r dx ese (x), and one

obtains eq. (2.7) in the semi-classical approximation.

for inationary models which are based on the de sitter spaces ds4 with

one has

and hence

a( ) = 1() cos ()

se(a, ) = 

3

16v ()

0(a, ) = exp

3

16v ()

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

thus the probability density for nding the universe in a state with  = const., a = 1() =

q 3

8v () is

p = |0|2 = e3/8v ()

(2.13)

the distribution function (2.13) has a sharp maximum as v ()  0. for inationary models
this is a bad feature, because it diminishes the possibility of nding the universe in a state
with a large  eld and thereby having a long stage for ination. however, from the point
of view of liouville string theory, the result (2.13), if indeed valid, implies that the critical
string theory (since v  q2 there) is a favourable situation statistically, and hence any
consideration (such as those in [10]) made in the neighbourhood of a xed point of the

renormalization group ow on the moduli space of running coupling constants is justied.

9

c. moduli space wavefunctionals

let us now proceed to discuss the possibility of nding a schrodinger wave equation for
the d-particle wavefunction. the identication (2.7) in the inationary case needs some

careful verication in the case of the topological expansion of the worldsheet -model (2.1).
in liouville string theory, the genus expansion of the partition function may be identied

[15] with the wavefunctional of non-critical string theory in the moduli space of coupling
constants {gi}:

(2.14)

(2.15)

({gi}) = xgeneraz dx es[x;{gi}]  ef [{gi}]

where

f [{gi}] =

xh=0
(gs)h2 fh[{gi}]

is the eective target space action functional of the non-critical string theory. the sum
on the right-hand side of (2.15) is over all worldsheet genera, which sums up the one-
particle irreducible connected worldsheet amplitudes fh with h handles. the gradient ow
property (2.4) of the -functions ensures [10,15] that the helmholtz conditions for canonical
quantization are satised, which is consistent with the existence of an o-shell action f [{gi}].
in that case, the eective lagrangian on moduli space whose equations of motion coincide
with the renormalization group equations (2.2) is given by [10]

lm(t) = i gij j

(2.16)

and it coincides with the zamolodchikov c-function. the semi-classical wavefunction deter-
mined by (2.14) is thereby determined by the action c[] regarded as an eective action on

the space of two-dimensional renormalizable eld theories. thus the probability density is
p[{gi}] = e2f [{gi}], which implies that the minimization of f [{gi}] yields a maximization
of p[{gi}], provided that the eective action is positive-denite. this is an ideal situation,
since then the minimization of f [{gi}], in the sense of solutions of the equations f /gi = 0,
corresponds to the conformally-invariant xed point of the -model moduli space, thereby

justifying the analysis in a neighbourhood of a xed point.

however, the identication (2.14) is not the only possibility in non-critical string theory,

as will be discussed below, in particular in connection with the schrodinger dynamics of
d0-branes. the main point is that upon taking the topological expansion in liouville string
theory, the couplings gi become quantized in such a way so that

xgenera

z dx es[x;{gi}] = zm({gi})

di e 1

22 i gij j z dx es(0)

 [x;{gi +i}]

(2.17)

10

where the prime on the sum means that the genus expansion is truncated to a sum over
pinched annuli of innitesimal strip size, s(0)
 [x;{gi}] is the tree-level (disc or sphere) action
for the -model, and i are worldsheet wormhole parameters on the moduli space m({gi})
of the two-dimensional quantum eld theory. the gaussian spread in the i in (2.17) can
be interpreted as a probability distribution characterizing the statistical uctuations of the
coupling constants gi. the width  is proportional to the logarithmic modular divergences
on the pinched annuli, which may be identied with the short-distance innities log  at
tree-level [10] ( is the worldsheet ultraviolet cuto scale). the result (2.17) suggests that

one may directly identify the genus expansion of the worldsheet partition function as the
probability density

2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)({gi}, t)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

 p({gi}, t)

(2.18)

for nding non-critical strings in the moduli space conguration {gi} at liouville time t (the
worldsheet zero mode of the liouville eld). in this way one has a natural explanation for

the reality of eq. (2.17) on euclidean worldsheets. if the identication of the genera summed
partition function with the probability density holds, i.e. with the square of the wavefunction
({gi}, t) rather than the wavefunctional itself, then one may obtain a temporal evolution
equation for (2.18) using the wilson-polchinski renormalization group equation on the string
worldsheet [14]. this will be described in section iv.

notice that if one interprets the topological expansion of the worldsheet partition function
as the probability density for the non-critical string conguration {gi}, then the simple
argument leading to eq. (2.7) is not valid here. in such a situation the action in eq. (2.9),
which refers to the string moduli space, is not the same as the eective target space action
f [{gi}], but rather something dierent, corresponding to the phase of the wavefunctional
({gi}, t) whose probability density (2.18) corresponds to the genera summed worldsheet
partition function. this is not necessarily a bad feature, as we shall see, although in most
treatments the target space eective action f [{gi}] is identied with the moduli space action
the local worldsheet renormalization
upon identication of the liouville zero mode (i.e.

group scale) with target time. for this, we observe that the statistical interpretation of the
resummed worldsheet partition function is compatible with the interpretation in [10] of the

gaussian wormhole parameter distribution function in eq. (2.17) as being responsible for
the quantum uncertainties of d-branes. this follows trivially from the fact that

2

= e2f ({gi},t)

(2.19)

then, any correlation function may be written as

hvi1    vini = zm({gi})

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)({gi}, t)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
dgi (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)({gi}, t)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

which using eq. (2.19) gives the connection between the two probability distributions.

iii. matrix d-brane dynamics

in this section we shall briey review the worldsheet description of [10] for matrix d0-

brane dynamics. the partition function is given by [9]

i = 1, . . . , 9 label spacetime and spatial directions of the target space, which we assume has

the complex auxilliary elds a( ) and a( ), a = 1, . . . , n, transform in the fundamental
representation of the brane gauge group, and they live on the boundary of the worldsheet

 which at tree-level is a disc whose boundary is a circle  with periodic longitudinal
coordinate   [0, 1] and normal coordinate   r. they have the propagator h a( )b()i =
ab (   ), where  denotes the usual step function. the integration over the auxilliary
elds with the measure (3.3) therefore turns (3.2) into a path-ordered exponential functional

of the elds x which is the t -dual of the usual wilson loop operator for the ten-dimensional
gauge eld (a0, 1
2 y i) dimensionally reduced to the d-particle worldlines. in this picture,
a0 is thought of as a gauge eld living on the brane worldline, while y aa
, a = 1, . . . , n,
are the transverse coordinates of the n d-particles and y ab
, a 6= b, of the short open
string excitations connecting them. we shall subtract out the center of mass motion of the
assembly of n d-branes and assume that yi  su(n). we shall also use su(n)-invariance
of the theory (3.1) to select the temporal gauge a0 = 0.

(3.5)

instead of being forced to sit on a unique hypersurface as in the case of a single d-brane, in

the non-abelian case there is an innite set of hypersurfaces on which the string endpoints
are situated. in this sense the coordinates (3.5) may be thought of as an abelianization
of the non-abelian d-particle coordinate elds y ab

.

to describe the non-relativistic dynamics of heavy d-particles, the natural choice is
i (x0) =
to take the couplings to correspond to the galilean boosted congurations y ab
y ab
i x0, where ui is the non-relativisitic velocity matrix. however, logarithmic modular
i + u ab
divergences appear in matter eld amplitudes at higher genera when the string propagator
l0 is computed with dirichlet boundary conditions. these modular divergences are can-
celled by adding logarithmic recoil operators [10,22] to the matrix -model action in (3.1).

from a physical point of view, if one is to use low-energy probes to observe short-distance
spacetime structure, such as a generalized heisenberg microscope, then one needs to con-
sider the scattering of string matter o the assembly of d-particles. for the galilean-boosted

multiple d-particle system, the recoil is described by taking the deformation of the -model
action in (3.1) to be of the form [10]

is the regulated step function whose   0+ limit is the usual step function. the operators
(3.7) have non-vanishing matrix elements between dierent string states and therefore de-
scribe the appropriate change of quantum state of the d-brane background. they can be

13

thought of as describing the recoil of the assembly of d-particles in an impulse approxima-
tion, in which it starts moving as a whole only at time x0 = 0. the collection of constant
matrices {y i

(3.1).

ab, u j

the recoil operators (3.7) possess a very important property. they lead to a deformation
of the free -model action in (3.1) which is not conformally-invariant, but rather denes a

logarithmic conformal eld theory [23]. such a quantum eld theory contains logarithmic
scaling violations in its correlation functions on the worldsheet, which can be seen in the

present case by computing the pair correlators of the elds (3.7) [22]

logarithmic divergence of the conformal blocks of the theory. note that (3.10) vanishes as
  0, so that the logarithmic worldsheet divergences in (3.9) cancel the modular annulus di-
vergences mentioned above. an essential ingredient for this cancellation is the identication

[22]

1
2 = 2 log 

(3.11)

which relates the target space regularization parameter  to the worldsheet ultraviolet cuto

scale .

logarithmic conformal eld theories are characterized by the fact that their virasoro
generator l0 is not diagonalizable, but rather admits a jordan cell structure. here the
operators (3.7) form the basis of a 2  2 jordan block and they appear in the spectrum
of the two-dimensional quantum eld theory as a consequence of the zero modes that arise
from the breaking of the target space translation symmetry by the topological defects. the
mixing between c and d under a conformal transformation of the worldsheet can be seen

explicitly by considering a scale transformation

   =  et/

(3.12)

using (3.11) it follows that the operators (3.7) are changed according to d = d + tc
and c = c. thus in order to maintain scale-invariance of the theory (3.1) the coupling

14

constants must transform under (3.12) as [22,24] y i = y i + u it and ui = u i, which are
just the galilean transformation laws for the positions y i and velocities u i. thus a scale
transformation of the worldsheet is equivalent to a galilean transformation of the moduli
space of -model couplings, with the parameter 2 identied with the time evolution pa-

rameter t =  log . the corresponding -functions for the worldsheet renormalization

group ow are

from the renormalization group equations (3.13) it follows that the renormalized velocity

operator in target space is truly marginal,

d u i

(3.17)

which ensures uniform motion of the d-branes. it can also be shown that the renormalized
string coupling gs is time-independent [10]. if we further dene the position renormalization

(3.18)

then the -function equations (3.13) coincide with the galilean equations of motion of the

d-particles, i.e.

the d-particles. the moduli space lagrangian (2.16) is then readily seen to coincide with

iv. evolution equation for the probability distribution

in this section we will derive the temporal evolution equation for the probability density
p({gi}, t) following the identication of time with a worldsheet renormalization group scale
(i.e. the liouville zero mode). the basic identity is the wilson-polchinski equation for the

case of the worldsheet action (2.1) which reads [14]

e

g(z  w) =d 

(4.2)



is the two-point function computed with respect to the conformal eld theory action s[x].
the basic assumption in arriving at eq. (4.1) is that the ultra-violet cuto  on the string

16

(4.1)

worldsheet appears explicitly only in the propagator g(z  w), as can always be arranged
by an appropriate regularization [14].

henceforth we shall concentrate on the specic case of interest of a system of n interact-
ing d-particles. then, upon summing up over pinched genera, there are extra logarithmic

divergences in the greens function (4.2) coming from pinched annulus diagrams, which may
be removed by the introduction of logarithmic recoil operators, as explained in the previous

section. using primes to denote the result of resumming the topological expansion over
pinched genera, we then have that

e =

(4.3)

where the correlator hiint includes the disc and recoil interaction contributions. subtracting
the disc -dependence in normal ordering, the remaining dependence on the worldsheet
cuto comes from the two-point functions of the logarithmic recoil operators, giving terms
of the form





x(z)x(w) 

 log d 
the leading divergence comes from the correlation function hd(z)d(w)i  log , which
follows upon the identication (3.11). thus we may write

(cid:16)accc(z)c(w) + acdc(z)d(w) + addd(z)d(w)(cid:17)e

where cg > 0 is a numerical coecient whose precise value is not important, and we have
used the fact that u i  su(n).

in the case of a system of recoiling d0-branes, the -model couplings in eq. (4.7) are given
by (3.6) with the abelianized couplings (3.5) of y ab
viewed as the boundary values for the
open string embedding elds xi( ) on the d-brane. this means that the elds xi( ) are

the fact that terms of the form x0(x0) and (x0)(x0) vanish with the regularization (3.8)
[10]. the terms involving xi( )xj() will average out to yield terms of the form

ab|2 hc( )c()i  o(2)

(4.9)

where we have used the logarithmic conformal algebra. at leading orders, these terms vanish,
but we shall see the importance of such sub-leading terms later on.

using the dirichlet correlator

(4.10)

(4.11)

which has the eect of renormalizing the velocity matrix u i

o(2) terms for the moment, we nd that the remaining terms in the wilson-polchinski
renormalization group equation (4.1) yield a diusion term for the probability density:

ab  u i

tp[y, u; t] = cg

9xj=1

nxa,b=1| u j

yip[y, u; t] + o(2)

this equation is of the fokker-planck type, with diusion coecient

d = cg

9xi=1

nxa,b=1| u i
ab|2

(4.12)

(4.13)

coming from the quantum recoil of the assembly of d-particles. the diusion disappears

when there is no recoil. note that (4.13) naturally incorporates the short-distance quantum
gravitational smearings for the open string interactions (compare with eq. (1.2)), and it

18

arises as an abelianized velocity for the constant auxilliary eld conguration a( ) = a( ) =
1 a = 1, . . . , n.

the evolution equation (4.12) should be thought of as a modication of the usual conti-
nuity equation for the probability density. indeed, as we will now show, the o(2) terms in
eq. (4.12) coming from (4.9) are of the form yiji, where
2im(cid:16) yi  yi(cid:17)

ji =

hm

(4.14)

is the probability current density. here

m =

1

gs

,

hm = 4gs

(4.15)

are, respectively, the bps mass of the d-particles and the moduli space planck constant. 1

for this, we note rst of all that such terms should generically come in the form

 yiji = 

hm

m (cid:16)2

yi arg (cid:17)p 

hm
m

(yi arg )yip

(4.16)

the second term in eq. (4.16), upon identication of the probability density p with the
genera resummed partition function on the string worldsheet, is proportional to the world-
sheet renormalization group -function, given the gradient ow property (2.4) of the string

eective action [20], so that

yip = 2p gijj

(4.17)

which is to be understood in terms of abelianized quantities. in the present case the renor-
malization group equations are given by (3.17) and (3.19) and, since the couplings u ab
i
are truly marginal, we are left in (4.17) with only a zamolodchikov metric contribution
gcc = 2n4hc( )c( )i (note that here one should use suitably normalized correlators

1the identication (4.15) of plancks constant in the d-particle quantum mechanics on moduli
space with the string coupling constant is actually not unique in the present context of considering
only the exchange of strings between d-particles. as discussed in [10], the most general relation,
compatible with the logarithmic conformal algebra, involves an arbitrary exponent  through
hm = 4(gs)1+/2. the exponent  arises from specic mechanisms for the cancellation of modular
divergences on pinched annular surfaces by appropriate world-sheet short-distance innities at
lower genera. the only restriction imposed on  is that it be positive denite. as shown in [10],
the standard kinematical properties of d-particles are reproduced by the choice  = 2
3 . a choice of
 6= 0 seems more natural from the point of view that modular divergences should be suppressed
for weakly interacting strings. however, in the present case, we assume for simplicity the value
 = 0, which yields the standard string smearing  for the minimum length uncertainty. the
incorporation of an arbitrary   0 in the formalism is straightforward and would not aect the
qualitative properties of the following results.

19

hi which yield the behaviour (4.17)). from the logarithmic conformal algebra it therefore
follows that a term with the structure of the second piece in eq. (4.16) is hidden in the

contributions (4.9) which were dropped as being subleading in . furthermore, from (3.15),
(4.16), (4.5), (4.8) and (4.9) it follows that to leading orders

yi arg  = 

cgui

2


9xj=1

ab|2
nxa,b=1| u j

(4.18)

where ui = dyi/dt is the worldsheet zero mode of the abelianized, renormalized velocity
operator. it then follows that to leading orders we have 2

yi arg  = 0.2

thus, keeping the subleading terms in the target space regularization parameter  leads

to the complete fokker-planck equation for the probability density p = :

tp[y, u; t] = yiji[y, u; t] + d 2

yip[y, u; t]

(4.19)

where ji is the probability current density (4.14), with  the wavefunctional for the system

such quantum diusion is characteristic of all liouville string theories [15,17,25]. the re-

sulting quantum dynamics, including the quantum diusion which arises from the d-brane
recoil, is described by the schrodinger wave equation which corresponds to this fokker-

planck equation. this equation is analysed in detail in the next section.

v. non-linear schr odinger wave equations

given the fokker-planck equation (4.19), there is no unique solution for the wavefunction

, as we discuss below, and the resulting schrodinger wave equation is necessarily non-linear,
due to the diusion term [26,27]. consider the quantum mechanical system with diusion

2noncommutative position dependent terms arising from commutators [yi, yj] appear only at two-
loop order in -model perturbation theory [10]. an interesting extension of the present analysis
would be to generalize the results to include these higher-order terms into the quantum dynamics.
however, given that the pertinent equations involve only the abelianized coordinates (3.5), we do
not expect the inclusion of such terms to aect the ensuing qualitative conclusions. the eect
of the noncommutativity is to render the quantum wave equation for the system of d-particles
non-linear, through the recoil-induced diusion from the multi-brane interactions, as we discuss in
the subsequent sections (for a single brane one would obtain a free wave equation governing the
quantum dynamics).

20

which is described by the fokker-planck equation (4.19) for the probability density p = .
in [26] it was shown that, by imposing dieomorphism invariance in the space ~y  m and
representing the symmetry through the innite-dimensional kinematical symmetry algebra
c(m) + vect(m), one may arrive at the following non-linear schrodinger wave equation:
(5.1)

h0 =

yi + vm(~y, ~u; t)

(5.2)

(5.3)

here vm(~y, ~u; t) is the interaction potential on moduli space and the real continuous quantum
number d in (4.13) is the classication parameter of the unitarily inequivalent dieomor-
phism group representations. other models which have more than one type of diusion
coecient can be found in [26,27].

a crucial point [27] is that there exist non-linear phase transformations of the wave-

function  (known as quantum mechanical gauge transformations) which leave invariant
appropriate families of non-linear schrodinger equations, and also the probability density p.
such transformations do not aect any physical observables of the system. this implies that
the choice of  is ambiguous, once a density p is found as a solution of eq. (4.19) on the
collective coordinate space {y ab
i } of the d-branes. an important ingredient in nding such
transformations is the assumption [27,28] that all measurements of quantum mechanical sys-

tems can be made so as to reduce eventually to position and time measurements. because of
this possibility, a theory formulated in terms of position measurements is complete enough
in principle to describe all quantum phenomena. this point of view is certainly met by
the d-brane moduli space, whereby the wavefunctional depends only on the couplings {gi}
and not on the conjugate momenta pi = ihm /gi . the group of non-linear gauge trans-
formations acts on each leaf in a foliation of a family of non-linear schrodinger equations,
such that the two-dimensional leaves of the foliation consist of sets of equivalent quantum

mechanical evolution equations.

it follows that then one can perform the following local, two-parameter projective gauge

transformation of the wavefunction [27]:

(5.4)

under which the probability density is invariant, but the probability current transforms as

here (t) and (t) 6= 0 are some real-valued time-dependent functions. the collection of all
non-linear transformations n, obeys the multiplication law of the one-dimensional ane
lie group af f (1). under (5.4) there are families of non-linear schrodinger equations that
are closed (in the sense of gauge closure). a generic form of such a family, to which the

non-linear schrodinger equation (5.1) belongs, is

the gauge group af f (1) acts on the parameter space of the family (5.6). some members
of this family are thereby linearizable to an ordinary schrodinger wave equation under the
action of (5.4). these are the members for which there exists a specic relation between d
and d [27], and for which ehrenfests theorem of quantum mechanics receives no dissipative
corrections. the quantum mechanics of d-particles is not of this type, given that there
is denite diusion, dissipation and thus time irreversability. however, as discussed in

[10,22,24], one needs to also maintain galilean invariance, which is a property originating
from the logarithmic conformal algebra of the recoil operators. as described in [27], there is a

class of non-linear schrodinger wave equations which is galilean invariant but which violates
time-reversal symmetry. for this, it is useful to rst construct a parameter set of equations
of the form (5.7) which remain invariant under the gauge transformations (5.4). we may

describe the parameter family of equations (5.6) in terms of orbits of af f (1) by regarding
 = 2m1 and  = 2m1 as the group parameters of an af f (1) gauge transformation (5.4).
then the remaining ve parameters in (5.7) are taken to be the functionally-independent
parameters j, j = 1, . . . , 5, which are invariant under af f (1) and are dened by

(5.9)

a detailed discussion of the corresponding physical observables is given in [27]. for our

purposes, we simply select the following relevant property of the non-linear schrodinger
equation based on the parameter set (5.9).

consider the eect of time-reversal on the non-linear schrodinger wave equation. setting

t  t is equivalent to introducing the following new set of coecients:

i = 1, 2

j = 1, . . . , 5

(i)t = i
(j)t = j
(vm)t = vm

(5.10)

where the superscript t denotes the time-reversal transformation.
it is straightforward
to show [27] that, in terms of the js, there is time-reversal invariance in the non-linear
schrodinger equation if the two parameters 1 and 4 are both non-vanishing. on the other
hand, a straightforward calculation also shows [27] that galilean invariance sets 4 = 0,
thereby implying that a family of non-linear schrodinger wave equations which is invariant

23

under g(9) but not time-reversal invariant indeed exists. for a single diusion coecient
d 6= 0, as in the case (4.13) of recoiling d-branes, one may set dcj = 0 (corresponding to
the af f (1) gauge choice 1 = 0) and thereby obtain the set of gauge invariant parameters:

1
2 d
1 =
2 = 2g4
s
3 = 1
4 = 0
5 = g4

s 

1
4 d2

(5.11)

the parameter set (5.11) breaks time-reversal invariance, as expected from the non-trivial

entropy production and decoherence characterizing the worldsheet renormalization group ap-
proach to target space time involving liouville string theory [10,15,29]. but it does preserve

galilean invariance, as is required by conformal invariance of the non-relativistic, recoiling
system of d-particles.

one may therefore propose that the fokker-planck equation for the probability density
p on the moduli space of collective coordinates of a system of interacting d-branes implies
a schrodinger wave equation for the pertinent wavefunctional which is non-linear, galilean-

invariant and has a time arrow, corresponding to entropy production, and hence explicitly
broken time-reversal invariance. the existence of a dissipation d  tr| u i|2, due to the
quantum recoil of the d-branes, implies that the ehrenfest relations acquire extra dissipative
terms for this family of non-linear schrodinger equations. for example, one can immediately

obtain the relations [26]

of extra dissipation terms in (5.12) in the ehrenfest relation for the momentum operator

bpi = ihm yi, which are proportional to tr| u i|2, may now be compared to the generalized

heisenberg uncertainty relations that were derived in [10]. these extra terms are determined

by the total kinetic energy of the d-branes and their open string excitations, and they show
how the recoil of the d-brane background produces quantum uctuations of the classical

24

spacetime dynamics. the relationship with quantum uncertainty relations will be discussed
in the next section.

vi. solutions of the matrix d-brane wave equation

in this section we shall discuss the situation governing some of the solutions [26,30] of the

class of non-linear schrodinger equations (5.6) which will be of interest to us in the context
of the quantum states of a system of many d-particles. we may parametrize the generic
wavefunctional  by an amplitude 1(~y, t) and a phase 2(~y, t) as

 = exp (1 + i2)

(6.1)

which, on account of (5.6), satisfy the following coupled system of non-linear partial dier-
ential equations [30]:

0 = t1  222
0 = t2 + 222

yi1  12

(6.3)

where we have selected the gauge 1 = 0. notice that there are ambiguities in the phase
function 2 in (6.1), which imply that the non-linear schrodinger equation (5.6) and the
amplitude and phase equations (6.2) are not completely equivalent. however, any solution
of the phase and amplitude equation yields a solution of the non-linear schrodinger equation

(5.6). this is the commonly accepted point of view [30], and the one which we adopt in this
paper.

a. mass superselection rules

one of the key properties of the matrix d-brane system that we have exploited extensively
thus far is its galilean invariance (or equivalently that the matrix -model deformation

25

denes a logarithmic conformal eld theory). it is worthwhile to rst mention some basic
facts concerning galilean invariant quantum eld theories in the non-dissipative case (d = 0)
[31]. consider two non-relativistic spinless elds 1 and 2 of masses m1 and m2 with a
quartic 12 interaction mediated by a two-body potential v (~x  ~y). the corresponding
haag expansions of their asymptotic elds are determined by haag amplitudes fi(~x~xa, t
ta; ~x  ~xi, t  ti), where a = 1, 2 labels the two elds and i labels the dierent bound states
of the system. then the function fi(~x1  ~x2) dened through the equal time relation

fi(~x1  ~x2; ~x1  ~xi) =  ~xi 

m1~x1 + m2~x2

m1 + m2 ! fi(~x1  ~x2)

for the stationary bound state problem. this shows that the modied haag amplitude is

exactly the schrodinger wavefunction of the bound state, with the reduced mass of the two
particle system.

the important property used in arriving at the result (6.5) is the galilean invariance

of the system. the unitary projective representations of the galilean group that arise in
non-relativistic quantum mechanics cannot be reduced to vector representations, in contrast

to the situation for most other physically relevant groups, such as the poincare and lorentz
groups. explicit mass parameters appear in the phase factors of these representations which

lead to the bargmann superselection rule [32] that the sum of the masses appearing in the
kinetic terms of the hamiltonian must be conserved in every physical process. this implies,

in particular, that the mass of any bound state must simply be the sum of the masses of
its constituents. note that since we are dealing with a non-relativistic theory, the energy
is not equal to the mass and indeed the energy of a two-particle bound state diers from
the sum m1 + m2 by the binding energy. since in the case of a composite system of n
heavy d-particles, the non-linear schrodinger equation also stems from the very specic

galilean invariance of the matrix d-brane dynamics, one might expect this superselection
rule to carry over to the present diusive situation. this would then imply that the mass
appearing in the eective kinetic term should be nm = n g1
colours n can be absorbed into the normalization of the mass, i.e. the n-body d0-brane

s /, and the number of

system behaves just like a single d-brane. however, this is not what we shall nd below
when we derive the extended haag decomposition which takes into account the diusion
terms, i.e. of the quantum recoil of the d-particles. the massive dirichlet string exchange

which generates contact interactions among d-branes and gives rise to a non-linear quantum
mechanical evolution equation must correctly be incorporated in order to distinguish a single

26

brane from the non-abelian matrix d-branes. in the following we shall derive the modied
superselection criteria that arise in the present context.

b. stationary solutions

the rst important class of solutions of interest to us here are the stationary solutions
which are dened as usual [26] by tp = 0. this is equivalent to assuming t1 = 0.
consider the free case whereby the moduli space interaction potential is ignored, vm = 0.
then, setting 1(~y, t) = const., one obtains from the amplitude equation in (6.3) the plane
wave solutions (~y, t) = 0 ei(~k~y(~k)t), with a modied dispersion relation obtained from
the resulting phase equation in (6.3):

t2(~y, t)  (~k) =  hm

2m

+ c3d! ~k 2

(6.6)

notice that for the galilean invariant but time-reversal violating case (5.11), with d = 0,
the dispersion relation (6.6) is that of a non-relativistic massive free particle.

the fact that such plane wave solutions exist is an important feature of the present

approach to the description of the eective dynamics of a system of many d-particles. as
discussed in sections iv and v, the pertinent wave equation of a system of n d-particles,

interacting via the exchange of strings, is written down in terms of the abelianized positions
yi in (3.5), rather than an n-body quantum mechanics that one would expect from the
eective yang-mills reduction arising in the standard low-energy description of multiple d-
particle dynamics [3]. this seems to tie in nicely with the heuristic fat brane picture of the

multiple d-brane system advocated in [33], according to which one treats the assembly of
d-particles as a single one with string interactions now encoded in the diusion term (4.13).
had one instead started with the yang-mills matrix quantum mechanics from the onset,

then one would have obtained a linear schrodinger equation with interactions taken care of
by the yang-mills potential. this is what had been studied in the literature so far [3], with

no denite, general conclusions about the bound state problem for strings and d-particles
(see [4] for recent developments). in the present approach, we eectively reduce the quantum

mechanics to a single body problem (the dynamics of the fat brane [33]), at the cost of
obtaining a non-linear wave equation. this explains quite naturally the dispersion relation

(6.6) in the case where string interactions between the d-branes are ignored. note also that
the energy is proportional to g2
s and thereby depends on the open string excitations between
the constituent d-particles.

a non-trivial issue concerns the nature of the eective moduli space potential vm(~y, ~u; t)
in the context of the -model

among the constituent d-particles of the fat d-brane.

27

approach to the system of recoiling d-particles [10], the eective potential vm among the d-
particles is determined by the zamolodchikov c-function for the deformed -model at hand,

which according to the discussion in [10] and in section iii, is given by the born-infeld la-
grangian (3.20). in the context of the (abelianized) fat brane picture, therefore, one would

expect that the relevant born-infeld eective action can be reduced to the one containing

only velocity terms of the form trq1  | u i|2, given that the coordinate-dependent commu-

tator terms in (3.22) may be neglected to a rst-order approximation, i.e. to leading orders
in -model perturbation theory [10]. such a coordinate independent potential may then be

shifted to zero, and hence the free particle case vm = 0 discussed above corresponds to the
galilean invariant multiple d-particle system in a rst-order approximation. this is similar
in spirit (but not identical) to a discussion of the ground-state properties of the multiple

d-particle system, given that the absence of the non-commutative commutator terms in the
born-infeld action (3.20) also guarantees unbroken supersymmetry in the standard eective

yang-mills target space description of multiple d-particle systems [34]. this commutative
limit is a saddle-point solution of the full u(n) quantum gauge theory.

however, the free case is not a satisfactory approximation if one wishes to include quan-
tum uctuations about such ground states, i.e. to properly incorporate string interactions
between the d-particles which may enable them to form a bound state. such a case would

correspond to o-shell non-conformal backgrounds in a -model context which naturally
appear when one considers a quantum eld theory of d-particles [17,25]. unfortunately, the

precise form of the eective moduli space potential in that case is still not known in a closed
form (see [10] for the rst few terms in a velocity expansion of the c-function). for instance,

it is known [3,34] that when a string stretches between two d-particles one obtains a linear
(conning) potential, but the inclusion of an arbitrary number of strings complicates the

situation. moreover, as discussed in section v, there is no unique way of associating the
non-linear schrodinger equation (5.6) to the eective fokker-planck equation for the proba-
bility distribution (4.19) which was derived by world-sheet renormalization group methods.

in particular, the precise form of the eective potential in the linear part of the associated
schrodinger equation is irrelevant for yielding the fokker-planck equation (4.19). this latter

equation is essentially that which governs the quantum mechanics on moduli space. as we
now show, the present approach enables one to make some non-trivial (and generic) state-

ments about the existence of bound state solutions in the multiple d-particle system under
consideration, without precise knowledge of the eective moduli space potential vm(~y, ~u; t).

to this end we discuss a second class of stationary solutions of the non-linear schrodinger
equation (5.6), which are valid for a generic (but appropriate) potential vm. such a case
incorporates the complex dynamics that binds strings and d-particles in fat d-brane

28

congurations. let us make the ansatz

2(~y, t) = m11(~y)  t

(6.7)

in the galilean invariant case (5.11) of relevance to us here, the function (6.7) also solves
(6.3) and the resulting phase equation for 1 is

eq. (6.11) corresponds to an ordinary linear schrodinger wave equation of a particle in the

the wavefunctions (6.13) are square-integrable,   l2(m), if (~y)1/ are.

depending on the form of the potential vm, such solutions may correspond to bound

states of the aliated linear equation (6.11), with the same potential vm but with a shifted
eective mass (6.12). it is desirable that the eective mass be positive, or otherwise the

interaction potential changes its sign. this requires  > 0 in (6.10). for a xed string
coupling constant, from (4.13) we see that the requirement of positivity of the eective
bound state mass m translates into a limiting velocity for the d-brane dynamics. in the
abelian case, this limiting velocity is just the speed of light [35], as follows from the form
of the abelian born-infeld action which coincides with the standard relativistic free particle

29

action in this case. here we nd the bound on the velocities of the multiple d-particle
system appropriate to the non-abelian born-infeld action and the formation of bound state

composites. alternatively, for a given order of magnitude of the diusion coecient (4.13)
set by the recoil velocities of the d-particles, we nd that bound state solutions exist for
string couplings stronger than a critical value gs given by

gs =vuut

cg
2

9xi=1

tr| u i|2

(6.14)

the solutions of the non-linear schrodinger equation dier from the bound state solutions

of the aliated linear equation by a spatially dependent phase proportional to the diusion
coecient d. in the framework of the fat brane picture of [33], such bound states may be
thought of as corresponding to bound state solutions of a system of d-particles interacting
via the exchange of strings. the existence of a critical coupling (6.14) is then physically

appealing, because it implies the formation of bound state condensates of d-particles and
strings for strong enough string interactions, in similar spirit to the conventional quantum
eld theoretic case. this is in agreement with the fact [34] that for weak string interactions

between the constituent d-branes, the eective spacetime is commutative and no bound
states can form. when the string interactions become strong, bound states form and render

the eective target space geometry noncommutative. note that in the present case, the
critical coupling (6.14) depends non-trivially on the (kinetic) energy scale of the recoiling

d-particles, indicating that a certain minimum amount of energy is required to form the
bound state. this velocity dependence is also quite natural, since it means that no bound
states can form if the d-particles move too quickly relative to one another.

let us note also that (6.13) is the analog of the haag decomposition in the non-diusive
case, since it is obtained from a linear schrodinger equation via a non-linear, quantum

mechanical gauge transformation. this non-linearity implies that the bound state solutions
of the aliated linear wave equation with shifted mass m and potential vm(~y, ~u) acquire
a phase that depends on ~y through the haag amplitude (~y). the transition from the
non-linear equation to a related linear one is mediated in part by this ~y-dependent phase.

the eective bound state mass (6.12) is then the analog of the bargmann superselection
criterion in the present case, which we see is modied by a non-linear transformation of the
original bps mass m and also the quantum recoil diusion.

c. gaussian wave solutions

the non-linear schrodinger equations admit additional non-trivial solutions of a gaussian
wave type. such congurations acquire particular importance in the fat d-particle context,

30

given that among them there are solitary waves, and one would expect their appearance in
view of the role of d-branes as solitons in string theory. the gaussian wave ansatz for the

wave-functional  is described by

1(y, t) = 
2(y, t) = 

1
2

log (t)

(y  s(t))2
8m(t)2 +
2m(cid:16)a(t)y2 + b(t)y + c(t)(cid:17)
1

(6.15)

where we have restricted ourselves, for simplicity, to one spatial dimension y, given that
the gaussian cases are separable [30]. here s, , a, b, c are real-valued functions of t which

are determined from the amplitude and phase equations (6.3) by equating the dierent
powers of y that appear. this leads, in general, to a system of coupled non-linear ordinary
dierential equations for these functions of t [30,36]. this set of equations can be reduced to

two ordinary second order dierential equations for  and s, and a, b, c may be expressed
directly in terms of the solutions of these equations.

for our purposes we note that one may explicitly construct gaussian wave solutions in
the free case vm = 0. among them are also gaussian solitary wave solutions with time-
independent width (t) = 0 = const. for the free case vm = 0, the amplitude and phase
equations (6.3) imply that a necessary condition for the existence of such solutions is [30]

2 + 5 = g4

s  d2

4

= 0

(6.16)

which, on account of (4.13) and (4.15), would imply extreme ne tuning between the mag-
nitude of the velocities of the recoiling d-particles and the string coupling gs. thus it is
unlikely to be met in a generic situation, so that the class of gaussian solitary waves do

not seem to describe the d-brane dynamics (see however the discussion below for a dierent
interpretation).

nonetheless, the gaussian ansatz (6.15) allows one to carry out some explicit calculations
and thereby see directly the eect of the quantum recoil through the non-linearity of the
wave equation. this also enables one to make some non-trivial consistency checks of the

present formalism. as an illustration, consider the free case vm = 0, for which the dierential
equation for the function s(t) is that of the classical motion of a free particle, s = 0. galilean
invariance may then be used to set s(t) = 0 for all t, because a general solution s(t) = u0t+s0
can be obtained from the s = 0 one by a g(1) transformation. the remaining dierential

equations can be easily integrated by quadratures to give the solutions [36]

where 0, f0 and c0 are appropriate integration constants and  is dened in (6.10). the
complete solution for the wavefunction  is then obtained by substituting (6.17) into (6.15)

and (6.1) with s = 0. from this solution it is straightforward to compute expectation values
of operators in terms of gaussian integrals, and in particular arrive at the variance relation

(6.18)

the uncertainty relation (6.18) corresponds to that of a minimum uncertainty

wavepacket, with eective planck constant determined by the string coupling, as is conjec-
tured in [10]. in fact, eq. (6.18) has a remarkably similar form to the modied heisenberg
uncertainty relations that were derived in [10] directly from the string -model genus ex-

pansion, in that it contains a diusion term proportional to the total kinetic energy of the
d-particles and their open string excitations which implies that the accuracy with which

one can measure position and momentum in a system of d-particles depends on the (recoil)
energy that arises in the measurement process. such an energy dependence is characteristic

of string-modied uncertainties and quantum gravitational eects. at time t = 0 we can
expand the right-hand side of (6.18) for slowly moving branes to get

(6.19)

to leading orders in -model perturbation theory and for weakly coupled strings, the mo-

[10]. choosing sgn f0 = 1, it follows that (6.19) has the usual form of the string-modied
heisenberg uncertainty relation:

(6.20)

the solution to the equation for the extrema of y in (6.20) as a function of p leads
to the usual minimum measurable length, and hence to the standard expectations that it

32

is not possible to probe distances smaller that the intrinsic string length or the spacetime
planck length using only d-particle probes (note that for f0  0 there is no bound on the
measurability of lengths in the spacetime). notice that one may in fact use the complete form
of the phase space uncertainty relations derived in [10], along with the modied ehrenfest

relations (5.12), as a necessary criterion to determine in general if a candidate wavefunction
represents the true quantum states of the d-particles and strings. we shall not do so here,

but rather carry on with the heuristic analysis and present one nal possible description of
the quantum dynamics of the system.

d. solitary wave solutions

there exist other types of solitary waves which may occur for certain regions of the
two-dimensional parameter space spanned by 2 and 5. the construction of such solutions
in the free case vm = 0 may be carried out as follows [30]. for the galilean invariant case
under consideration, if 1 and 2 are solutions of the equations (6.7) and (6.8), then the
galilean boosted amplitude and phase

1(~y, t) = 1(~y  ~ut)
2(~y, t) = 2(~y  ~ut, t)  m~u  ~y 

m~u 2

2

3t

(6.21)

with ~u a constant velocity, are non-stationary solutions of (6.3). such transformations take

the original galilean invariant solution of the non-linear schrodinger equation (5.6),(5.11),
with 4 = 0, 3 = 1, to solutions in the more general case

 21(1 + 3) + 4 = 0

(6.22)

the resulting solution for the wave-functional  then reads

(~y, t) = 0 exp 1(~y  ~ut)  i"4m11(~y  ~ut) + m~u  ~y +
where 0 is a constant. the associated probability density p =  is itself a solitary wave,
moving with constant speed and without changing its shape:

3t + t#!

2

p(~y, t) = |0|2 exp 21(~y  ~ut)

(6.24)

in the particular case where 2 (2 + 5) < 0, i.e.  < 0, one obtains square-integrable
solitary wave solutions of the form [30]

(6.25)

notice that the condition  < 0 is opposite to that for the existence of positive eective

mass bound states in the aliated linear schrodinger equation (6.11). this implies that
such coherent solitonic states cease to exist for string couplings stronger than the critical

value (6.14), for given recoil velocities of the d-particles.

such solitary waves may play an important role in the underlying dynamics of a sys-

tem of d-particles. the fact that they arise in the fat brane picture indicates that the
latter degree of freedom constitutes an eective coarse-grained description of macroscopic
quantum coherent states that may characterize (under the specied conditions) a certain

phase of the ground state of a system of d-particles interacting among themselves via the
exchange of strings. from this point of view, the critical coupling situation (6.16) where
gs = gs , corresponding to gaussian solitary waves, may be thought of as a critical regime
separating the bound state phase from the solitary wave coherent phase. it should be noted,
however, that although the wavefunctions (6.13) and (6.25) are non-analytic around gs = gs,
this change of solution should not be regarded as some phase transition in string coupling

constant space. rather, when the string interactions become weak enough to untighten the
bound states of d-particles and strings, the quantum dynamics is described by minimum
uncertainty wavepackets which produce the appropriate smearing to the quantum spacetime.

outside of this regime the d-particles behave as freely propagating solitary waves lending
another interpretation to the notion of d-branes as string theoretic solitons. it should also be

stressed that this heuristic picture is complementary to the picture discussed in [10], where
the microscopic structure of groups of recoiling d-particles under the exchange of strings

has been studied in detail in a -model context. in the present picture one nds an eective
quantum mechanics for a coarsed grained description of the multiple d-particle system,

in which lumps of d-particles are described as single bodies obeying a non-linear diusive
schrodinger dynamics which encodes their interactions. as mentioned before, this analysis
is at present preliminary and must thought of as a heuristic picture for the d-brane dynam-

ics, given that it neither incorporates supersymmetry nor the precise form of the eective
moduli space potential vm. the above discussion has only centered around the free case as

an illustration, which is correct only to a certain approximation, since the abelianization of
the collective coordinates of the d-particles, on which the free particle picture is based, is

not accurate beyond this mean eld approximation.

34

vii. conclusions

the above discussion completes the rst analysis concerning the construction of a
schrodinger-type wave equation (here non-linear) for the wavefunctional of a collection of
d-particles. this equation is the present proposal for the complicated quantum dynamics of

dirichlet branes, at least within the framework of worldsheet -model perturbation theory.
further analysis should concentrate on the applicability of such studies to interferometric

devices, which might probe planckian physics. the non-linear schrodinger dynamics that we
have described above to characterize generic systems of d-branes should also be compared to

the linear modications of schrodinger wave equations in open quantum mechanical systems
interacting with a stochastic type environment. such types of interactions are customarily

assumed in many approaches to quantum gravity.

there are, in general, arguments against non-linear schrodinger wave equations, mostly
stemming from the fact that non-linearities may lead to superluminal propagation, i.e. mo-

tion which goes faster than the speed of light (see the discussion in [27] and references
therein). in the d-brane picture advocated above, there is the advantage of expressing the

system in a closed but non-linear form, i.e. writing a self-consistent quantum equation
which comprises only known degrees of freedom, including recoil. in the above analysis we

did not use environment operators, which are usually unknown and assumed to be generi-
cally of a stochastic form. in the present approach we have demonstrated the existence of
quantum diusion and of stochasticity [10,15] in the sense of gaussian probability distribu-

tions obtained explicitly as a result of summing over all worldsheet genera (i.e. coming from
the quantum string theory).

moreover, as shown in [10], the resulting o-shell target space action underlying the
schrodinger dynamics near a xed point in moduli space (where the entire approach is

valid) is the non-abelian born-infeld action, which implies a limiting velocity (equal to
the speed of light) for the d-particle dynamics [35]. this feature prevents superluminal

propagation. thus the issues of superluminal propagation due to a non-linear schrodinger
wave equation, which were originally advocated in [37], cannot apply to the d-particle
cases. these issues express such conceptual diculties as the possibility of using long-

ranged quantum correlations to send instantaneous signals, and of communicating among
dierent quantum mechanical worlds in a multiple world interpretation. as noted in [27],

since non-linear gauge transformations on the wavefunctional can be found which linearize
the non-linear schrodinger wave equation, such claims cannot be correct in general. the

fokker-planck equation that we have derived for the probability density may correspond to
a linear schrodinger wave equation, but of an open system, i.e. including interactions with

environmental degrees of freedom (in agreement with the analysis of [17,37]). however, the

35

non-linear wave equation involving only functionals of , and thereby closing the system, is
preferred. we do not need to appeal here to the unknown environmental degrees of freedom

to describe the recoil-induced diusion of d-brane dynamics.

although the arguments for superluminal propagation are overcome by the existence of a

born-infeld lagrangian for the d0-brane dynamics, a more direct approach is desired since
the fokker-planck diusion equation implies that an external environment is present for the

d-brane dynamics. this may be argued through the fact that the non-linear eects that we
have considered cannot produce superluminal propagation because the present formalism
is self-consistent only for weakly-coupled strings with gs  0 (corresponding to heavy d-
particles and hence very small velocities). light string states are then obtained by s-duality
under which the resulting schrodinger wave equation may indeed become linear.

notice also that the time-reversal violation of the eective wave equation that we have
obtained is implied directly (through entropy production) by the fact that decoherence is

present in the system of d-particles. however, if cp t is conserved in a standard string
theory, then t violation should occur if cp symmetry breaking is present. in the born-

infeld lagrangian one may have induced cp violation in four dimensions, for example, by
the introduction of topological instanton terms. in string phenomenology such terms arise
quite naturally upon compactication of the target space. the present approach which

allows decoherence (due to the energy dependence of the quantum uncertainties) therefore
provides a natural explanation of the supression of cp symmetry in string theory. but

generally in decohering quantum mechanical systems cp t is not conserved, so the above
approach also dierentiates between standard particles and recoiling d-particles.

we close by mentioning that non-linear quantum dynamics may be desirable from another
point of view discussed recently in [38]. the non-linear evolution of correlated systems (i.e.

those involving the dynamics of many particle states) may be free from the contamination
by negative probabilities which inict the corresponding linear case. the d-brane systems
we are considering here always involve many d-branes interacting with each other via the

exchange of closed string states.
in the present picture [10] single d-particles are only
viewed as a limiting case of a multi-brane system where the constituent branes are separated
at macroscopic distances compared to the string length . the non-linear dynamics,
therefore, which we proposed in this article, may be essential for guaranteeing complete

positivity of the system in the generalized sense discussed in [38]. if one accepts the modern
viewpoint of string-inspired phenomenology of the observable world [39], according to which

the latter is represented as a d-brane interacting with other branes via the exchange of closed
string bulk states only, then the above-mentioned issues may be of crucial importance for a
consistent formulation.
