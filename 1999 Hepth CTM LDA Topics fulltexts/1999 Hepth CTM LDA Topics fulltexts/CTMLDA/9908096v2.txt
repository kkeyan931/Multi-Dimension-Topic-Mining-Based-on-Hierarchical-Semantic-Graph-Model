abstract

we study the question of existence and the number of normalized vacuum states
in n = 4 superyangmills quantum mechanics for any gauge group. the mass
deformation method is the simplest and clearest one.
it allowed us to calculate
the number of normalized vacuum states for all gauge groups. for all unitary
groups, #vac = 1, but for the symplectic groups [starting from sp(6) ], for the
orthogonal groups [starting from so(8)] and for all the exceptional groups, it is
greater than one. we also discuss at length the functional integral method. we
calculate the decit term for some nonunitary groups and predict the value of the
integral giving the principal contribution. the issues like the bornoppenheimer
procedure to derive the eective theory and the manifestation of the localized vacua
in the asymptotic eective wave functions are also discussed.

introduction

consider the theory obtained by the dimensional reduction of n = 4, d = 4 superyang
mills theory (which is obtained in turn by the dimensional reduction of n = 1, d = 10
sym theory to four dimensions) when the whole space is shrinked to a point and we
are dealing with a supersymmetric quantum mechanical (sqm) system involving 16 real
supercharges. in (9+1)dimensional notations,

the specics of the n = 4 theory (compared with n = 1 and n = 2 theories) is that the

is the gauss law constraint. we are interested only in the gauge invariant states ga|i = 0
for which the second term in (1.4) vanishes, and we have the standard algebra of extended
sqm. the dynamics of this theory (and more simple sqm theories with 8 and 4 real
supercharges obtained by dimensional reduction of n = 2 and n = 1 sym theories) was
a subject of intense interest since the middle of eighties [1, 2]. as was rst noted in [2],
the spectrum of the hamiltonian (1.2) is continuous and the band of delocalized states
starts right from zero. the reason for that is very simple. the classical potential energy
in the hamiltonian (1.2) goes to zero if

s = 1, . . . , r, where r is the rank of the gauge group. back in 1982 witten noticed that,
in supersymmetric case, this valley is not lifted by quantum corrections [3]. as a result,
the low energy wave functions tend to smear out along the valley. as the valley (or alias,
the vacuum moduli space) (1.7) is not compact, the motion is innite, the wave function
is delocalized, and the spectrum is continuous.

one can make this statement more accurate, writing down the supercharges and hamil-
tonian describing the motion along the valley of slow variables in bornoppenheimer
spirit. in the lowest order in the bornoppenheimer expansion parameter 1/(g|a|3), the
result is very simple [3, 4]

if the orthonormal basis in the cartan subalgebra is chosen (for clarity, the sum over s is
written explicitly). thereby, the problem is reduced to the problem of free motion in the
(d  1)r = (2n + 1)rdimensional at space [with a certain discrete symmetry imposed;
this symmetry will be discussed in details in the appendix, and a detailed derivation of
eq.(1.8) will be given in sect. 4 ]. the spectrum is obviously continuous.

the theory (1.2) is interesting by itself, but also because of its relations to brane
dynamics. the hamiltonian (1.2) for the gauge group su(n) in the large n limit just co-
incides with the mass operator of 2+1 supermembranes embedded in 9+1 - dimensional
space [5]. the fact that the spectrum of (1.2) is continuous means that the supermem-
brane mass spectrum is continuous [4, 6]. the realization of this fact has quenched early
attempts to build up a supermembrane theory (where supermembranes were treated as
fundamental objects ).

the revival of interest to the hamiltonian (1.2) was due to a recent discovery that
on top of delocalized continuum spectrum states, the hamiltonian (1.2) enjoys also a
normalized vacuum state. 1 the existence of such a state is very important for dbrane
theory (in the modern approach where dbranes are not believed to be fundamental
ingredients of the theory, but kind of solitons in the holy grail mtheory). in the following,
we will not use the brane terminology, however, and will concentrate on studying the
dynamics of the hamiltonian (1.2) as it is.

originally, the existence of the normalized supersymmetric vacuum state was demon-

strated when calculating carefully the witten index

(1.9)

for the hamiltonian h. for the systems where the spectrum is discrete and where all the
states are localized, this is a rather straightforward method. as all the bosonic states
with non-zero energy have their fermionic counterparts, the expression tr{(1)f eh}
does not depend on  in this case. one can present tr{(1)f eh} in the functional
integral form and calculate it in the limit   0 where the functional integral is reduced
1the eective hamiltonian in eq.(1.8) does not enjoy such a normalized vacuum. there is no con-
tradiction here because the supersymmetric vacuum state of the full hamiltonian (1.2) is localized in the
region g|a|3  1 which is just the region where the eective theory (1.8) makes no sense. an important
remark, however, is that the existence of the normalized vacuum in the full theory (1.2) can be conjec-
tured by analyzing the dynamics of the eective free theory [7, 8]. we will discuss it in details in sect. 5
of the paper.

for systems with continuous spectrum, the situation is more intricate. instead of the

trn(1)f eho = xn

(1.13)

we have continuous integrals involving boson and fermion spectral densities which, gen-
erally speaking, are not equal even though the hamiltonian is supersymmetric, and we
cannot argue anymore that the supertrace tr{(1)f eh} is independent. we can
write

the rst term here is called the principal contribution and the second term is known as
the decit term. in many cases, the second term is just zero even though the spectrum
is continuous. the example of such benign system is the spectrum of massless dirac
operator on r4 in the instanton background (as it is well known, the chiral symmetry of
this problem can be presented as supersymmetry [10]). as the instanton eld falls away
rapidly at large distances, we have the continuum spectrum states with asymptotics of
plane waves. but on top of that, we also have the normalized fermion zero modes. their
number is given by the atiyahsinger theorem, and the atiyahsinger index is nothing
else as the witten index in this particular problem. it can be presented in the form (1.14)
where the decit term is absent. the benign nature of the dirac system is related to
the fact that we can compactify r4 on s4 (so that the spectrum becomes discrete) while
preserving the supersymmetry.

but it is not so for the problem under consideration. both principal and decit term
contribute on equal footing here. let us briey comment rst on the calculation of the
principal term. to begin with, assume that the gauge group is su(2) (the most simple
case). one can show that the corresponding nite dimensional integrals (for n = 1,
n = 2, and n = 4 theories) have the form

respectively. the integrals in the r.h.s. of eq.(1.15) were rst correctly calculated in
ref.[2]. however, the correct expressions (1.15) dier from the expressions quoted in
ref.[2] by the overall factor 1/4 in the case of n = 1 theory, and by 1/8 in the case of
n = 2 and n = 4 theories. correspondingly, the correct results (found in [11]):

dier from the results quoted in refs.[2] by these factors. 2

the calculation of the principal contribution for more complicated groups is a rather
intricate business. for higher unitary groups su(n), it was done in recent [12]. the result
is

where the sum in the last formula runs over all integer divisors m of n including n, but
not including 1.

the results (1.16, 1.17) are fractional, but the number of supersymmetric normalizable
vacuum states is, of course, integer. that means that in our case the decit term cannot
be zero. and it is not. a not so dicult calculation (which we will dwell upon in details
later) displays

for the su(n) gauge group. subtracting (1.18) from (1.17), we nally obtain

(iw )n =1 = (iw )n =2 = 0,

(iw )n =4 = 1 ,

(1.18)

(1.19)

i.e. the quantum mechanical systems obtained by the dimensional reduction of n = 1
and n = 2 supersymmetric yangmills theories with su(n) gauge group does not have a
normalizable supersymmetric vacuum state at all, while the theory (1.2) has exactly one
such state.

this is ne, but the method just outlined has two disadvantages. first, it is indirect
and does not give a clue how the wave function of the normalized vacuum state looks like.
second, it is far from being obvious how to generalize this method to non-unitary groups.
the calculation of the primary contribution is especially tricky. already the paper [12]
where the principal contribution was calculated for unitary groups was technically very

2this is not just an arithmetic error. the dierence in normalization factor stems from dierent
methods used when deriving (1.15). the authors of ref.[11] implemented gauge invariance by imposing
gauss law constraint on the wave functions while the starting point in ref.[2] was the hamiltonian with
the constraints explicitly resolved on the classical level. the missing factors can be restored in this
approach if taking into account the condition of discrete weyl invariance for the wave functions. see
appendix for more details.

dicult. we have no idea how to generalize it to symplectic, orthogonal, or exceptional
groups. what we are able to do is to calculate the decit term for other groups. we will
present these calculation in sect. 4.

our main message, however, is dierent. as has been observed in [13], the presence
of the normalized vacuum state in n = 4 theory can be established without coming to
grips with dicult calculations of the integrals for witten index. it suces to deform
the theory adding the mass term to the matter elds (we are thinking now of our theory
in n = 1 4-dimensional terms where it involves the gauge multiplet and 3 chiral matter
multiplets in the adjoint representation of the group). establishing the supersymmetric
vacua becomes now an almost trivial business of solving some simple algebraic equations.
the number of quantum vacua just coincides with the number of (gaugeinequivalent)
solutions of these classical equations. it turns out that for unitary groups, there is only
one such solution.
if the mass is large, the bornoppenheimer approximation works,
and one can just write down the vacuum wave function explicitly. we are interested in
the theory in the opposite limit m  0 where this cannot be done. but, by continuity,
the normalizable vacuum state exists for any mass, however small it is. it is a natural
hypothesis that the state remains to be normalizable also at the point m = 0. this
hypothesis is conrmed by the indirect calculations of iw .

the great advantage of this mass deformation method is that its generalization to
higher groups is not dicult. it turns out that the problem is reduced to the problem
of classication of the so called distinguished nilpotent elements of a complex simple
lie algebra the solution of which has been known to mathematicians for a long time. for
higher simplectic [starting from sp(6)], higher orthogonal [starting from so(8)] and for
all exceptional groups, the solution is not unique, and there are several supersymmetric
normalized vacuum states.

in the next section, we will write down the equations determining the positions of the
classical vacua in the large m limit, solve them for the unitary groups, and discuss at some
length the philosophy of this method. sect. 3 is devoted to solving these equations for
other groups. the nal result for the counting of supersymmetric vacuum states presents
the content of theorem 6. in sect. 4, we calculate the decit term in eq.(1.14) for some
groups. in sect. 5, we discuss a third way to deduce the existence of the normalized vac-
uum state(s) in n = 4 sym quantum mechanics: via studying the asymptotic solutions
for the eective theory. we present a simple derivation for the asymptotic supersymmetric
wave function in the su(2) case. calculation of the principal contribution to the witten
index in the su(2) theory is the subject of the appendix.

2 mass deformation of the n = 4 theory.

as we have mentioned before, the problem (1.1, 1.2) has exciting reverberations for d
branes and mtheory. however, the dynamics of this quantum mechanical model can be
understood better if exploiting the other relation: the relation of (1.1, 1.2) and of the
conventional 4dimensional supersymmetric eld theory. in 4dimensional language, the
variables aa

(2.5)

the appearance of the higgs average (2.5) breaks down the gauge invariance completely;
all gauge elds and their superpartners acquire mass of order m. as the solution (2.5) is
unique, the same applies to the matter elds irrespectively of whether we are at the vicinity
of classical vacua with hivac  c or hivac = 0. when mass is large m  echar  g2/3,
the state (2.5) is separated from the sector hivac = 0 by a high barrier.
in the limit
m  , this barrier becomes unpenetrable, and if in the morning we wake up in the
sector with hivac  0, we are going to stay there also by the end of the day. the presence
of heavy matter elds would not be felt and the dynamics would be the same as in n = 1
4dimensional sym theory.
on the other hand, when mass is small, the barrier disappears and the new vacuum
state overlaps essentially with the conventional vacuum sector. in the limit m  0, the
state (2.5) goes over into the celebrated localized supersymmetric vacuum state of the
hamiltonian (1.2).

let us emphasize that the nal conclusion that yes, there is such a localized super-
symmetric state is valid irrespectively of whether we are thinking in the language of the
sqm system (1.1, 1.2) or in the language of the associated 4dimensional eld theory. in

7

the former case, one should speak about a deformation of the hamiltonian (1.2) leaving
only 4 of 16 real supercharges q conserved. even for nonzero m, the system involves
the continuum spectrum associated with the (4dimensional) gauge potentials aa
i . for
large m, the localized state is well separated from the continuum spectrum states but, in
the limit m  0, it is kind of mixed up with them making the analysis dicult. still,
the true index, the number of the normalized vacuum states does not depend on m and
for the su(2) gauge group, is equal to 1.

if we are thinking in terms of 4dimensional eld theory, the most convenient way
to treat it is to put it in a nite spatial volume. that makes the spectrum discrete and
just removes all uncertainties connected with nonzero decit contribution in eq.(1.14).
if you like, going from quantum mechanics to eld theory dened in the box presents a
convenient infrared regularization making the motion nite and preserving supersymmetry
it plays the same role as the compactication r4  s4 for the dirac operator
[15].
in gauge eld background. the only dierence is that, for the problem (1.2), such a
regularization brings about a lot of (innitely many) new degrees of freedom, but as we
know since [3] how to handle them in case when the spatial box is small, it is not a real
problem.

in the eld theory with large mass, we have one extra state at large values of higgs
average, and also two conventional vacuum states of n = 1 sym theory coming from
the region   0 where the heavy matter elds decouple. in this approach, the answer
iw = 1 is not obtained as a dierence iw = i p
4 , but rather as the dierence
iw = 3  2, with 3 being the witten index of the n = 4 sym eld theory while 2 is
the witten index of n = 1 sym eld theory. this reasoning emphasizes again that the
separate terms like 5/4, 1/4 or 3, 2 have no particular physical meaning. only the total
answer iw = 1 is meaningful.

one more remark is in order. as we see, when going from m =  to m = 0, the new
vacuum state appears in the physical spectrum, and it comes from innity of conguration
space. this phenomenon is well known. this happens e.g. in the models of wesszumino
type when the asymptotics of superpotential is changed. various gauge susy models
involving this phenomenon have been recently constructed. one example is the n = 1
theory with the g2 gauge group where superpotential for matter elds is modied by
adding a cubic term [16]. another classic example is n = 2 supersymmetric qcd [17].
some pecularity of n = 4 theory is that we do not add here any unusually high power in
superpotential, but just a quadratic mass term (while the cubic term was already there).
it was conjectured in [3] that the witten index in supersymmetric gauge theories with
nonchiral matter content (so that the mass terms can be added) is the same as in the
pure sym theory. we see that it is not true in this case. but it is true e.g. in the n = 2
theory where we have only one scalar eld and no cubic superpotential.
let us discuss now higher unitary groups. we have to solve again the equation system
(2.4), but with an additional requirement: the higgs average obtained should break the
gauge invariance completely and give mass to all gauge elds (otherwise, the wave func-
tions would smear out along the at directions corresponding to the remaining massless
elds, and the state would not be localized.

in mathematical language, that means that we are looking for the triples f = a

f ta
belonging to our lie algebra g which satisfy the relations (2.4) and whose centralizer

8

there is no such g  g that [g, f ] = 0 for all f = 1, 2, 3). as was
is trivial (i.e.
noted in ref.[14], this problem is reduced to the mathematical problem of classifying the
embeddings su(2)  g with trivial centralizer factorized over the action of the complexied
group g.
let us prove it. let g be the complex connected simple lie group with trivial center
such that g is its lie algebra. the group g acts on g faithfully via the adjoint represen-
tation. let k be a maximal compact subgroup of g. then there exists on g a unique
(up to a positive factor) positive denite hermitian form such that

k = {g  g|g = g1} .

let

p = {g  g|g = g and g is positive denite} .

then k  p = {1} and one has the following well-known polar decomposition

g = kp .

(2.6)

in other words, in any representation, the matrix representing the element of the complex
group g can be written as a product of a unitary and a positively dened hermitean
matrix.

lemma 1. if k  k, p  p , and pkp1  k, then pk = kp.
proof. we have:

for some k1  k. applying  to both sides of (2.7), we get

pk = k1p

comparing (2.7) and (2.8), we get

pk1p1 = k

p2kp2 = k

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

thus, p2 commutes with k, but since p is positive denite hermitean, we deduce that p
commutes with k as well.

corollary 1. if a1 and a2 are two real subalgebras of lie k  g isomorphic to su(2)
such that they are conjugate by an element g  g, then they are conjugate by an element
of k.

proof. we write g = kp, where k  k, p  p . then

(ad p)a1 = (ad k1)a2  lie k

denoting by ai the subgroup of k whose lie algebras are ai, we deduce:

(ad p)a1 = (ad k1)a2  k .

it follows from lemma 1 that (ad p)a1 = a1, hence a1 and a2 are conjugate by k.

theorem 1. triples of elements (t1, t2, t3) of g satisfying the equations

j ] = 0

1, it suces to show that conditions (i) and (ii) imply that tj = t 
j .

(i) [tj, tk] = ijkltl
(ii) [tj, t 
are conjugate by g if and only if they are conjugate by k.
proof. condition (i) means that tj form a basis of su(2)  g. in view of corollary
we may assume that tj  lie k (since the maximal compact subgroups of g are
conjugate). thus, we have a homomorphism  : sl(2)  g such that [su(2)]  k.
hence it suces to show that equations (i) and (ii) on three elements tj of sl(2) imply
that tj  su(2).

let 1, 2, and 3 be an orthonormal basis of su(2). we have for some g  sl(2) :

gtjg1 = j ,

j = 1, 2, 3 .

writing g = kp (polar decomposition) and replacing j by k1jk, equation (ii) gives:

xj

p2(jp2j)p2 = xj

jp2j ,

(2.10)

where p2 is a positive denite hermitean matrix. choosing a suitable basis, we may
assume that j are the pauli matrices. a direct calculation shows that (2.10) implies that
p = 1.

when g = su(n), there is only one such embedding (we will prove it rigourously in the
next section). it is sucient to write down the generators of su(2) in the representation
with the spin j = (n  1)/2 and treat them as the elements of the su(n) algebra in the
fundamental representation. for example, for su(3), the nontrivial triple is

1 + i2 = 


0 1 0
0 0 1
0 0 0

0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0

(2.11)

the existence and uniqueness of the solution means that the n = 4 theory with su(n)
gauge group has one and only one normalized vacuum state in agreement with (1.19).

the problem is reduced to nding all the solutions of the equation system (2.4) for an
arbitrary gauge group. it is not a trivial problem but, fortunately, its solution can be easily
derived from related problems that have actually already been solved by mathematicians.
let us rst introduce some basic notations and denitions. let g be a complex simple
lie algebra and g be the corresponding complexied group. choose a cartan subalgebra
h in g . a convenient choice of basis in g is a union of the basis of h and the root vectors
e: [h, e] = (h)e for any h  h,  (the linear forms on the cartan subalgebra) being
3 for any root ,  is also a root, and the whole set of roots  can be
the roots.

3in other notation, [hi, e] = ie for a particular basis hi in h.

10

decomposed into a set of positive roots + and a set of negative roots . if   ,
we will use the notation f for e. the commutator [e, f]   lies in the cartan
subalgebra. with the standard choice of normalization for the root vectors, [, e] = 2e
and [, f] = 2f,  is called the coroot. for any coroot , the identity

exp{2i} = 1  g

(3.1)

holds. for any ,    with  +  6= 0, [e, e] is proportional to e+ with nonzero
coecient if  +   , and [e, e] = 0 otherwise. a set of r simple roots (i) and the
corresponding simple root vectors ei, fi can be chosen so that all other root vectors are
obtained from ei, fi by a number of subsequent commutations. the corresponding coroots

(i)  hi present a convenient basis in the cartan subalgebra. the set {ei, fi, hi} is called
the chevalley generators. an element i  h commuting with all but one pair of simple
root vectors, so that

[i, ej] = ijej,

[i, fj] = ijfj ,

is called fundamental coweight.

an element x of a lie algebra g is called nilpotent (resp. semisimple) if ad x  [x, is a
nilpotent (resp. diagonalizable) operator on g. a subalgebra of g is called reductive if it
is a direct sum of simple subalgebras and a torus (i.e. commutative subalgebra consisting
of semisimple elements).

the following result is due to morozov, jacobson, dynkin, and kostant. its proof can

be found in [18, 19, 20].

theorem 2. let e be a nonzero nilpotent element of a simple complex lie algebra

g. then

(a) there exist elements h, f  g such that
[h, f ] = f,

[h, e] = e,

[e, f ] = h ,

(3.2)

i.e. ce + ch + cf is isomorphic to the 3dimensional simple algebra sl(2, c). in this
case, the element f is nilpotent and element h is semisimple with integer or half-integer
eigenvalues.

(b) if ce + ch + cf  is another 3dimensional simple algebra containing e, then there

exists g  g such that g(e) = e, g(h) = h, g(f ) = f .
elements of g and conjugacy classes of 3dimensional simple subalgebras of g.

(c) there is a bijective correspondence between conjugacy classes of nonzero nilpotent

it follows from theorem 2a that one has the eigenspace decomposition with respect

to ad h :

g = jz/2 gj,

[gi, gj]  gi+j, e  g1, f  g1

(3.3)

in other words, [h, x] = jx if x  gj. let g+ = j>0 gj, g = j<0 gj. the proof of the
following result may be found in [21].

theorem 3.
(a) the centralizer of e (resp. f ) in g is a sum of a reductive subalgebra m+ of g0 and

a subalgebra of g+ (resp. g) consisting of nilpotent elements (of g).

11

(b) [m+, e] = g1, [m, f ] = g1. in other words, the m +orbit of e (resp. m orbit of

f ) in g1 ( resp. g1) is open and dense.

(c) ad e: g0  g1 and ad f : g0  g1 are surjective linear maps. in particular, dim

g0  dim g1.

a nilpotent element e is called distinguished if m+ = 0. the following result is straight-

forward. its proof may be found in [18, 21].

theorem 4. a nilpotent element e is distinguished if one of the following equivalent

properties holds:

(i) the centralizer of e in g lies in g+, i.e. it consists of nilpotent elements.
(ii) dim g0 = dim g1.
(iii) dim g0 = dim g1.

a 3dimensional simple subalgebra of g is called distinguished if its (unique up to

conjugacy) nonzero nilpotent element is distinguished.

theorem 5. a 3dimensional simple subalgebra a of g is distinguished if and only if

its centralizer in g is zero.

proof. let a be a distingushed subalgebra of g and let e be the corresponding (dis-
tingushed) nilpotent element. but the centralizer c(a) of a in g is a reductive subalgebra
which lies in the centralizer of e, which consists of nilpotent elements due to theorem 3a,
hence c(a) = 0.

conversely, let a = ce + ch + cf be a 3dimensional simple subalgebra of g with
zero centralizer. then with respect to the adjoint representation of a in g, g decomposes
into a direct sum of nontrivial irreducible submodules vi such that dim(vi  gj) = 1 if
|j|  s and s  j  z, and dim(vi  gj) = 0 otherwise [see (3.3)]. it follows that dim g0
= dim g1 = dim g1, hence e is distinguished by theorem 4.

choose chevalley generators ei, hi, fi (i = 1, . . . , r) of g. the dynkin diagram with
dots on some of its nodes is called marked. such a marking denes a zgradation g = j gj
if we let deg ei = - deg fi = 1 if the i-th node is marked, and deg ei = deg fi = 0 otherwise.
a marking is called distinguished if

dim g0 = dim g1

(3.4)

according to dynkin [18] (see also [21]), one has a bijective correspondence between
conjugacy classes of distinguished nilpotent elements of g and distinguished markings of
the dynkin diagram of g. namely, given a distingushed nilpotent element e of g, we
construct a zgradation (3.3) of g by ad h and choose a set of positive roots + such
that [h, e]  1
2 (h)e if   +. it turnes out that (h) = 0 or 2 if  is a simple root,
hence we get a zgradation of g corresponding to a marked dynkin diagram. conversely,
given such a gradation, we pick e  g1 such that [g0, e] = g1 and take h  g0 such that ad
h denes this gradation. due to (3.4), there exists a unique f  g1 such that [e, f ] = h
giving a 3dimensional simple subalgebra with zero centralizer.
example 1. look again at eq.(2.11) dening the distingushed sl(2) subalgebra in

the sl(3) algebra. we have

1 + i2 = e + e  e , 1  i2 = f + f  f , 3 =  +   h ,

(3.5)

12

where  and  are two simple roots. the gradation dened by h involves: (i) g0 which
coincides in this case with the cartan subalgebra; (ii) g1 (resp. g1) with the basis e,
e ( resp. f, f); and (iii) g2 (resp. g2) with the basis e+ ( resp. f+). obviously,
the condition (3.4) is satised.

example 2. consider an arbitrary simple lie algebra g. choose an element   h
such that [, ei] = ei for all positive simple roots ei. the element  denes the canonical
gradation of the lie algebra (corresponding to the dynkin diagram with all nodes marked)
such that g0 is the cartan subalgebra; the basis of g1 ( of g1 ) is the system of positive
(negative) simple root vectors; g2 (resp. g2 ) is spanned by the root vectors of level 2
(resp. 2), etc. obviously, dim g0 = dim g1 = dim g1 = r.

in the sl(n) case, eq.(3.6) is reduced to the

we see thereby that, for any g, a solution of the equations (2.4) exists which provides
us with at least one normalized vacuum state for any gauge group g. for most of simple
groups, however, the solution is ] not unique. the simplest group involving more that one
supersymmetric vacuum is the group g2.

example 3. the system of roots of g2 is depicted in fig.1a, the system of corre-
sponding coroots 4 in fig.1b, and the dynkin diagram is drawn in fig. 1c. we have put
the dot on the long simple root , but not on the short root  (here and in the following
short roots will be denoted by smaller circles). thereby, a certain nontrivial marking of
the dynkin diagram is dened. the corresponding zgradation involves:

g0 with the basis , , e, and f
g1 with the basis
g1 with the basis
g2 with the basis
g2 with the basis

e, e+, e+2, and e+3;
f, f+, f+2, and f+3;
e2+3;
f2+3

(3.7)

the condition (3.4) is satised, and hence the marking in fig. 1b is distinguished.

let us construct now the corresponding distingushed sl(2) subalgebra, the distin-

guished triple (e, f, h). first, let us nd the required element of the cartan subalgebra

h :

[h, e] = e,

[h, e] = 0

(3.8)

so that the gradation (3.7) is realized by the action of ad h. this is just the fundamental
coweight corresponding to the node  of the dynkin diagram. in our case, h = (2 +

element of g1

choose

and impose the requirement [e, f ] = h. substituting here the standard commutators

f  g1 = a1f + a2f+ + a3f+2 + a4f+3 ,

[e+, f+] = ( + ) = 3 + 

[e+2, f+2] = ( + 2) = 3 + 2
[e+3, f+3] = ( + 3) =  + 

[e+, f] =

[e+2, f+] = [e+3, f+2] = e ,

we obtain 3 equations for 4 complex parameters ai:

|a1|2 + 3|a2|2 + 3|a3|2 + |a4|2 = 2
|a2|2 + 2|a3|2 + |a4|2 = 1
a2a1 + 2a3a2 + a4a3 = 0

(3.9)

(3.10)

dierent solutions to this equation system are related to each other by conjugation. the
convenient choice is a1 = a4 = 1, a2 = a3 = 0 which gives the triple

e = e + e+3,

f = f + f+3,

h = 2 + 

(3.11)

the distinguished sl(2) subalgebra of the lie algebra of g2 with the basis (3.11) is not
equivalent by conjugation to the universal subalgebra (3.6). therefore, the n = 4 su-
persymmetric yangmills quantum mechanics with the g2 gauge group has two dierent
normalized supersymmetric vacuum states.

example 4. consider the marked dynkin diagram for the sp(6) group drawn in fig.

2. the corresponding zgradation involves:

g0 with the basis , , , e, f ,
g1 with the basis
g2 with the basis
g3 with the basis

e, e+, e, e+, e2+ ,
e++, e+2+ ,
e2+2+ ,

(3.12)

and the subalgebras g1, g2, g3 spanned by the corresponding negative root vectors.
the condition (3.4) is satised, and hence the marking in fig. 2 is distinguished.

the fundamental coweights corresponding to the marked nodes:

(3.14)

all other solutions of this equation system are equivalent to eq(3.14) by conjugation. the
triples (3.14) and (3.6) present two inequivalent by conjugation distinguished sl(2) sub-
algebras of the lie algebra of sp(6). this gives two dierent normalized supersymmetric
vacuum states.

example 5. consider the marked dynkin diagram for the so(8) group drawn in fig.

3. the corresponding zgradation involves:

g0 with the basis , , , , e, f
g1 with the basis
g2 with the basis
g3 with the basis

e, e, e, e+, e+, e+,
e++, e++, e++,
e+++, e+++2

,

(3.15)

and the corresponding subalgebras g1, g2, g3. we have dim(g0) = dim(g1) = 5, and
hence the marking in fig. 3 is distinguished.

the distingushed triple can be constructed along the same lines as in the previous

example. it is (up to a conjugation):

h = 2( +  + ) + 3 ,
e = e + ei/3e + e2i/3e + e+ + ei/3e+ + e2i/3e+
f = f + ei/3f + e2i/3f + f+ + ei/3f+ + e2i/3f+ .

(3.16)

this triple together with the universal triple (3.6) gives us two dierent normalized su-
persymmetric vacuum states.

the full classication of distinguished markings for all algebras was done in refs.[18,

21]. translating it into our physical language gives immediately the following result:

theorem 6. the number of inequivalent by conjugation solutions of eq.(2.4) and
hence the number #vac[g] of dierent normalized supersymmetric vacua in the theory
(1.2) with gauge group g is

(a) #vac[su(n)] = 1.

(b) #vac[sp(2r)] coincides with the number of partitions of r into distinct parts. 5
(c) #vac[so(n)] coincides with the number of partitions of n into distinct odd

parts. 6

(d) #vac[g2] = 2, #vac[f4] = 4, #vac[e6] = 3, #vac[e7] = 6, and #vac[e8] = 11.

a nilpotent element of sp(n) [resp. so(n)] is distinguished i, viewed as an element of
gl(n) it can be conjugated to a jordan form with distinct even (resp. odd) sizes of jordan
blocks, and this jordan form completely determines the conjugacy class. denote by s the
number of these blocks; s just coincides with the number of nonzero distinct parts in the
partition of r = n/2 [resp. n].

let g = g/z (z  center of g) be the adjoint group. let sl(2) = ce + ch + cf  g
and let ge,h,f be the centralizer of this sl(2) in g. by a theorem of kostant [20], ge,h,f is
the maximal reductive subgroup of ge (the centralizer of e in g). the sl(2) is distinguished
if and only if the group ge,h,f is a nite group isomorphic to the group of components of
ge. the groups ge,h,f are always trivial in the sl(n) case and are isomorphic to zs1
in
the sp(2r) and so(2r + 1) cases and to zs2
in the so(2r) case, where s is the number
of jordan blocks of the nilpotent elements (see above). the nilpotent element e in the
universal distinguished triple (3.6) consists of just one block for sp(2r) and so(2r + 1) and
of two blocks for so(2r), and ge,h,f is always trivial.

let us illustrate it in the sp(6) example. sp(6) is a subgroup of su(6) leaving invariant
the form c  where  and  are some 6plets of su(6) and the antisymmetric
5for r = 1 or r = 2, we have only one universal solution (3.6). for r = 3 = 3 = 2 + 1, we have two

inequivalent solutions, for r = 6 = 6 = 5 + 1 = 4 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 3, we have four solutions, etc.

then the coroots of sp(6) are represented by the diagonal matrices 6  6:

the block j1 is formed be the center of the matrix (the columns and rows 3,4) and the
block j2  by its periphery. the triple (3.19) corresponds to the partition r = 3 = 2+1.
2 2 = 4 and 2 1 = 2 are the dimensions of the jordan blocks in (3.20). the centralizer
of the triple (3.19) in sp(6)/z2 is z2 whose nontrivial element is diag(1, 1,1,1, 1, 1).
in the so(8) example discussed above, we have two jordan blocks corresponding to
the partition 8 = 5 + 3, s = 2 and ge,h,f is trivial.

a. alexeevski [22] showed that for exceptional lie algebras, the groups ge,h,f are
always isomorphic to one of the symmetric groups sm where m = 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. we
list all the distinguished marked dynkin diagrams for exceptional lie algebras and the
corresponding values of m in the table in fig. 4. note that in all cases m = 1 for the
universal distingushed triples.

let us give the explicit construction of ge,h,f for g2. consider the following elements

of the group g2:

a = exp{2i/3}
b = exp(cid:26) i

2

(e + f)(cid:27) exp{ih/2}

(3.21)

with h = 2 +  as in eq.(3.11). the triple (3.11) is invariant under the action of a
and b. for the element a, it follows directly from the standard commutators [, e] =
3e, [, e+3] = 3e+3. the element b realizes the automorphism 7
( + )  ( + 2) ,
f  f+3, f+  f+2

e  e+3, e+  e+2,

(3.22)

(the rst line in eq.(3.22) describes the action of b on the cartan subalgebra of g2; it
is just the weyl reection of the system of coroots in fig. 1b with respect to the line
orthogonal to ). again, the triple (3.11) is invariant.

a and b satisfy the relations

a3 = 1, b2 = 1,

ab = ba2

(3.23)

the rst two of them follow immediately from the denition h = 2 +  and from the
property (3.1), and the third one is easily veried if leaving aside the common u(1) factor
exp{ih/2} and writing the su(2) part in the matrix form:
e2i/3 ! , b    0 i

the elements a, b satisfying the dening relations (3.23) generate the group s3, the cen-
tralizer of the distinguished exceptional triple (3.11) in g2.

in the physical language, the presence of non-trivial nite centralizers ge,h,f means
that our higgs averages, the solutions to eq.(2.4), in many case break down the gauge
symmetry not completely, but a discrete subgroup of the original gauge group remains
unbroken. some isolated examples of the systems where this phenomenon takes place
have been discovered before (see e.g. ref.[24]), but our construction with 3 adjoint scalar
elds is much more natural and gives a rich family of such examples.

4 decit term.

4.1 generalities. su (2) case.

as we have seen, solving the equation system (2.4) is the most direct and the most simple
way to obtain the answer. but the other ways to calculate the index, in particular the

7a side remark is that b is an exceptional element in the sense of ref.[23]: the fundamental group of
the centralizer gb = [su (2)]2/z2 is non-trivial (more exactly, the relevant fact is that the fundamental
group involves a non-trivial nite factor).

20

traditional way based on the formula (1.14) present also a considerable methodic interest.
the principal contribution has been calculated only for the unitary groups, and we do not
know now how to do it in other cases. speaking of the decit term, its calculation is much
more simple. in this section, we rst describe following refs.[11, 25] how the decit term
is calculated for the unitary groups and generalize this calculation to some orthogonal,
symplectic, and exceptional groups.

the main idea is the following. let us regularize the theory in infrared putting it in
i )2  r2. such a regularization breaks down
the large but nite ball with rigid walls (aa
supersymmetry, and the supertrace tr{(1)f eh} acquires a certain dependence so
that the integral in the second term in eq.(1.14) does not vanish. it turns out that this
gives a nonvanishing contribution also in the limit r   we are interested in ! it is
more or less clear (we address the reader to ref.[11] for details) that this is associated
with the behavior of the theory at large |a|. 8 however, as we have already noted, at
large |a|  g1/3 the theory is greatly simplied. basically, it is given by the eective
hamiltonian in eq. (1.8).
strictly speaking, the statement expressed in the last sentence is wrong and we will
see it soon. it is true, however, for, say, su(2) or su(3) gauge groups. it makes sense to
understand rst the spirit of the argumentation in the simplest su(2) example, and then
we will easily understand how to correct it in more complicated cases.

we will briey describe now the bornoppenheimer approach suggested in [3], de-
veloped in details in [26, 27, 4] and rediscovered in recent [7, 8, 28]. if the gauge group
is su(2) and (aa
i )2 is large, we can subdivide the physical bosonic variables (there are
altogether 24 such variables: 3  9 modulo 3 gauge degrees of freedom) into two groups:

of parameters) the ground supersymmetric state of h0 has zero energy and the gap

8another way of reasoning not requiring a rigid ball regularization and not using eq.(1.14) is the
following: the functional integral for the index in the limit   0 includes not only the contribution of
possible normalizable supersymmetric vacuum state, but is also contaminated by the lowlying states
of the continuum spectrum. the decit term is exactly this continuumdriven contamination whose
dynamics depends on the large |a| region.

(4.8)

the only thing which is left to understand is what happens when the derivative /ci
acts on the fermion part of the wave function (4.5). the latter depends on ci because the
choice (4.3) is possible only for some particular value of ci. when ci is shifted, the fermion
part of the hamiltonian (4.1) is modied and so is the fermion structure of its vacuum
wave function. let us rst consider the n = 1 theory with the hamiltonian written in
eq.(a.1). slow bosonic variables present a 3vector ci and we have just a couple of fast
weyl fermions a

(4.9)

(4.10)

this structure is orthogonal to (4.9) and gives zero after averaging.

a certain complication of the n = 4 case is due to the fact that a

 do not form a
representation of so(9). for a generic ci, the hamiltonian h0 does not conserve the fast
fermion charge (4.4), and the form of the wave function is more compicated than that in
eq.(4.9). we can make use of the so(9) invariance, however, and assume a special form
of the shift ci: c4 = . . . = c9 = 0. in 4dimensional language, that means that only
the gauge eld is shifted and scalar elds are not. in that case, the vacuum wave function
involves the product of 4 factors like in eq. (4.9) and its dierentiating over ci produces
the structure (4.10) with zero projection on the vacuum state.

thus, we have shown that

h0|/ci|0i = /ci

and the eective supercharge (4.6) is given by eq.(1.8). we have derived it for the su(2)
theory, but the derivation can be easily generalized for other groups. we will comment
on that a bit later.

the eective hamiltonian (in the su(2) case, it is just the 9dimensional laplacian)
can be obtained as (1/16){q, q}+ or also determined with the bornoppenheimer
procedure (which is a little bit trickier than for supercharges because one should take into

23

account also the contribution of excited states in eq.(4.2) [26, 27] ). qe
(properly normalized) 0(xslow).

 and h e act on

the simple result (1.8) is specic for pure supersymmetric yangmills theories and
theories with nonchiral matter content. for chiral theories (like qed with one left chiral
supereld of charge 2 and 8 right chiral superelds of charge 1, or the su(5) theory with
a left quintet and a right decuplet), the second term in the analog of (4.7) and also the
term due to the action of the derivative /ci onto 0(xfast) do not vanish after averaging.
a berry phase (with singularity at |a| = 0 ) appears [26]. also, for nonchiral theories,
but in the nexttoleading bornoppenheimer order, the calcutations are more involved
and the expressions are less trivial, the vacuum moduli space acquires a (conformally at,
but not just at) metric, etc [27]. all this is irrelevant in our case, however.

as the decit term is related to the large values of |a| and as, for such large values, our
original problem is equivalent to (1.8), the decit term of the original hamiltonian should
be equal to the decit term of h e. h e describes free motion and its spectrum consists
of delocalized plane waves. obviously, the total index (1.14) of h e is zero. and that
means that the decit term for h e (and hence the decit term for original hamiltonian
(1.2) should coincide with the principal contribution in h e.

naively, the latter seems to be zero. indeed, the classical hamiltonian h e = pipi/2
does not depend on fermion variables, and the fermion integrals in the analog of eq.(1.12)
should give zero. this is not true, however, and the reason is that not all eigenstates of
h e are physical and contribute in the supertrace tr{(1)1eh}. the matter is that
the requirement of the gauge symmetry of the wave functions imposes the requirement
of weyl invariance on the eigenstates of the eective hamiltonian [3]. in the su(2) case,
this weyl invariance corresponds just to the simultaneous sign reversal for ci and . the
wave functions should not change under such a transformation.

to be more precise, wave functions depend on ci and holomorphic variables   dened
like in eq.(1.3). in 4dimensional language, 8 complex variables can be interpreted as 4
weyl 4d spinors f with  = 1, 2 and f = 0, 1, 2, 3 (0 is the abelianized version of
gluino and (1,2,3) are related to the fermion components of chiral matter multiplets).
thus, we impose the requirement

(ci, ) = (ci,  )

(4.11)

it is not dicult to implement the discrete symmetry (4.11) in the path integral language.
the supertrace projected on the states invariant under the action of the weyl symmetry
(4.11) can be presented as the integral

substituting it in eq.(4.12), we nd that: (i) the rst term  supertrace for the system

and it is nonzero:

the factor 28 in the numerator comes from the fermion integrals and the factor 29 in the
denominator  from the bosonic integrals.

note that the result (4.14) holds universally for n = 4 theory and also for n = 2 and
n = 1 theories. indeed, for n = 1, we have just two fermionic variables and 3 bosonic
variables, for n = 2, we have 4 fermionic variables and 5 bosonic variables. we obtain

what happens for other groups ? let us start with applying the same logics and calculate
the decit term in the original nonabelian theory as the principal contribution in the
abelian eective theory (1.8) where only the weyl invariant states

(wcs

i, ws

) = (cs

i, s
)

(4.15)

are taken into account. let us call this contribution the proper decit term (we will
see by the end of this section that it is not the whole story and, generically, some other
contributions appear.)

the generalization of eq.(4.12) can be easily written:

iw =

substituting here the corresponding generalization of (4.13) and doing the integrals, we
obtain

iw =

det(1  w)

(4.17)

where  means that the sum is done over all elements of w with det(1 w) 6= 0. again,
this is true for all n .

it is instructive to compare the result (4.17) with the formula

iw =

#w xww

which counts the number of vacuum states within the sector of constant gauge potentials
for the n = 1 sym theory dened on small 3torus. 9 we have here the same set of

(4.19)

the problem of counting the states on 3torus is especially simple. one can show that
the sum in the r.h.s. of eq.(4.18) is equal to r + 1 for any group [23] which justies the
original wittens conjecture [3]. there is no such simple universal formula for the sum
(4.17), however. one should calculate it case by case.

consider rst the higher unitary groups [25]. the cartan subalgebra of su(n) is
realized by the matrices diag(a1, . . . , an), a1 + . . . + an = 0. the weyl group is the group
sn of permutations of an. only the elements w  w with det(1  w) 6= 0 contribute
in the sum (4.17). these are the so called coxeter elements corresponding to the cyclic
permutations of {an}. there are (n  1)! such elements (while #w = n!). all they are
equivalent by conjugation and have one and the same det(1  w). take the element

(this is just the permutation a1  a2  . . .  a1  . . . an1  a1 written as a matrix
in the basis {a1, . . . , an1}. one can show that det(1  w) = n. therefore, the proper
decit term for the su(n) gauge group is

i prop. def.

[su(n)] =

(4.21)

10there are at least two other ways to derive (4.18). first, one can duly take into account the de-
pendence of k on bosonic dynamical variables, but implementing besides (4.15) also the periodicity
conditions

(cs

i + ls

i ) = (cs
i )

is a set of 3 sdimensional vectors leaving invariant the weyl lattice.

where ls
in other words, for
i
the theory dened on the torus, global structure of our gauge group becomes important, and the weyl
symmetry involves not only rotations, but also translations [for su (2) we have, besides the symmetry
ci,   ci,, also the symmetry ci  ci + 2ni/(gl) with integer ni]. one can be convinced that
the eects brought about by the weyl rotations cs
i  wcs

cancel each other, and the answer (4.18) is reproduced.

formula (4.18) is also well known to mathematicians. it gives the number of invariants of w in the
grassman algebra over h  h which is equal to r + 1 due to [30] (see [23]). incidentally, eq.(4.18) with 2
replaced by 1 is equal to 1 since w has no nontrivial invariants in the grassman algebra over h [30].

26

as a simple exercise, one can calculate the sums in eqs.(4.18, 4.19) and derive 11

d = 4 :
d = 6 :
d = 10 :

iw = n
iw = n3
iw = n7

(4.22)

let us go over now to nonunitary groups. consider rst the groups so(2r + 1)
and sp(2r) [the root systems for these groups are dual to each other, their weyl groups
coincide, and the proper decit term (4.17) is the same]. it is easier to think in symplectic
language. the elements of cartan subalgebra of sp(2r) can be represented as the diagonal
matrices diag (a1, . . . , ar,a1, . . . ,ar). the weyl group is the product of the group sr
of permutations of ai and r z2 factors corresponding to the reections ai  ai. the
essential complication compared to the unitary case is that many dierent conjugacy
classes contribute in the sum (4.17). in the simplest case of sp(4) = so(5), #w = 8,
and 3 elements of two dierent conjugacy classes contribute:

w =   1

we have also made explicit calculations for sp(6), so(7), and g2. the results are given
in table 2 below.

4.3 total decit vs. proper decit.

eq.(4.21) is the correct result for the decit term for the unitary groups when n is prime.
but if n is not prime, eq.(4.21) is only one of the contributions. the total decit term
is given by the sum (1.18) over the divisors of n. in ref.[25], the appearance of these
extra terms was explained in terms of dparticles and dinstantons. we present here a
conventional (or, better to say, a conservative) explanation.

some problem appears already on the level of su(3). the vacuum valley is labelled

by two 9vectors ai and bi so that

(aa

i )slowta = diag(ai, bi  ai,bi )

(4.25)

let us nd now the su(3) version of (4.1) . to this end, we substitute a = aslow + afast
in the hamiltonian (1.2) and pick up the leading terms in |afast|/|aslow|. the potential
11it is remarkable that the same result for the d=10 theory is obtained with the thooft twisted

boundary conditions [31].

thus, there are 48 fast variables divided naturally into three groups: a1,2
satisfying

the condition (2a  b)a1,2 = 0, a4,5
satisfying the condition (a + b)a1,2 = 0, and
a6,7
satisfying the condition (2b  a)a1,2 = 0. (six variables with nonzero projection
i
(2a  b)a1,2, etc. are the gauge degrees of freedom; two other gauge degrees of freedom
are hidden in 48 variables: we should require that eigenstates of h0 be annihilated by
the gauss constraints g3 and g8 ).

i

again we have a supersymmetric oscillator. or rather combination of several oscilla-
tors with frequencies g|2a b|, g|a + b| and g|2b a|. the standard bornoppenheimer
philosophy of refs.[3, 4] works when these frequencies are much larger that the charac-
teristic energy scale g2/3, i.e. when

g|2a  b|3  1,

g|a + b|3  1,

g|2b  a|3  1

in other words, the eigenvalues a, b  a, and b should not be very small by absolute
value, and also they should not be too close to each other. from mathematical viewpoint,
the condition for the eigenvalues in eq.(4.25) are dierent means that the centralizer of
the generic element (4.25) in (9 copies of) su(3) coincides with the (9 copies of) the cartan
subalgebra of su(3).

when, say, 2ab  0, the elds a1,2

i become massless. at the point 2a = b, they form
together with the elds a3
i the su(2) gauge multiplet. a very important point is that
though the standard bornoppenheimer approach breaks down here, we still can treat
the system in bornoppenheimer spirit, only the classication of the dynamic variables
into fast and slow categories is modied. we have now 9 slow variables

(aa

i )slowta = diag(ai, ai,2ai )

(4.27)

i and a6,7

we still have abelian fast variables a4,5
. there are 32 such variables (a4,5a =
a6,7a = 0 !). they involve 31 physical variables and a gauge degree of freedom associated
with the rotation around the color axis 8. besides, we have 27 variables a1,2,3
which can
be called semi-fast (we will see very soon why). these 27 variables involve 24 physical
semi-fast variables and 3 gauge degrees of freedom. 12 the total wave function can be
written as [cf. eq.(4.2)]

(we did not display here explicitly the dependence on the fermion superpartners, but one
should remember that they are also present). osc

oscillator wave functions (4.5) with c = 3a. the characteristic scale of |a4,5|, |a6,7| is

(4.29)

explains why we called the variables a1,2,3 semi-fast. but as far as the bornoppenheimer
method is concerned, there is no distinction between fast and semi-fast variables.
once the condition g|a|3  1 is satised, we are allowed to integrate out both a47 and
a1,2,3 and write down the eective theory for a8  a. again, this theory is just (1.8)
with only one term in the sum and describes free motion in 9dimensional space.
a very important distinction compared with the su(2) case is, however, that we should
not impose now the invariance requirement with respect to any kind of discrete symmetry
for the eective wave functions 0(ai , ). indeed, nontrivial elements of the weyl group
do not leave the subspace (4.27) invariant. once we have xed the gauge as in eq.(4.27),
there is no more freedom. as a result, the valley (4.27) gives zero contribution to the
index, and the only non-zero one comes from the generic valley (4.25) with oscillator wave
functions in the fast sector.

the rst example where this eect of extra subvalleys with non-abelian fast sector

provides a contribution in the index is the su(4) theory. consider the subspace

(aa

i )slowta = diag(a, a,a,a)

(4.30)

it presents 9 copies of a certain subalgebra ha = diag(a, a,a,a) of the cartan sub-
algebra of su(4). the centralizer of ha in su(4) is su(2)  su(2)  u(1) and involves
nonabelian factors which support localized vacuum states. on the other hand, there
exist now a nontrivial subgroup wa of the original weyl group w = s4 leaving the
subalgebra ha invariant and acting on its elements faithfully. this is just z2 a non-trivial
element w of which corresponds to the sign reection a  a. thereby, we have to im-
pose now the symmetry requirement like in eq.(4.15). in the linear basis in ha, w = 1
and hence det(1  w) = 2 6= 0. as a result, the eective theory on the subvalley (4.30)
has a nonzero index (=1/4), and the total decit term is

i tot def
w

[su(4)] = (cid:18) 1

16(cid:19)generic valley

+ (cid:18)1

4(cid:19)subvalley (4.30)

(4.31)

for su(4), there is no other subvalley giving a nontrivial contribution in the index.

let us have an arbitrary group g, its lie algebra g and the cartan subalgebra h. let
us formulate the conditions on the subalgebra ha  h for the subvalley associated with ha
provide a nonzero contribution in the index:

(i). the centralizer of ha in g should involve a semi-simple factor .

29

(ii). consider a subgroup wa of the weyl group w leaving invariant ha . there should
be at least one element w  wa such that det(1 w) 6= 0 (w is understood as a matrix in
the basis on ha, not h).

(iii) the center of the centralizer of ha in g should coincide with ha.
(i) is necessary for the presence of a localized vacuum state in the fast sector. 13 (ii) is
required for the eective theory to have a nonzero index. the condition (iii) guarantees
that our bornoppenheimer separation of the variables is justied and that all non-valley
eld variables are indeed fast. 14

theorem 7. let g = su(n). the only subalgebras ha of its cartan subalgebra satisfy-
ing the conditions (i)  (iii) are the cartan subalgebras of su(m), m|n. the corresponding
subvalley gives the contribution 1/m2 to the decit term in the index.
proof. the conditions (i) and (iii) imply that ha presents a subalgebra of h commuting
with a certain nontrivial set of root vectors. for su(n) an element of h is represented
by a traceless diagonal matrix. a subalgebra ha consists of such matrices for which
some of the elements are equal, i.e. matrices of the form (a, . . . , a, b, . . . , b, c, . . . , c, . . . )
where a is repeated k1 times, b repeated k2 times, etc. to fulll the condition (ii), a
permutation which maps this ha in itself and has no xed vectors should exist. that
implies k1 = k2 = . . . = k. the relevant subgroup wa is sm with k = n/m: it involves
permutations of the set (a, b, c, . . . ). the corresponding contribution to the index is 1/m2.
thereby, the result (1.18) for the total decit term for the unitary groups is proven.

the subalgebras ha can be found and their contribution to the decit term can be
calculated also for nonunitary groups. as was just noted, the property equivalent to
(i), (iii) is that there exists a subset of roots a   such that ha = {h  h|(h) =
0 for all   a}. it is easy to see that, up to w conjugacy (conjugacy by an element of
the weyl group), we may choose a to be a subset of simple roots. given a subset a of the
set of simple roots, let wa = {w  w| w(ha)  ha} and let

w ia

then the total decit term is given by the sum

(4.32)

(4.33)

here the summation is taken over all subsets a of the set of simple roots modulo w 
equivalence. we will calculate the sum (4.33) for the (nonunitary) groups of the second
and of the third rank.

sp(4). a generic element of h can be presented as a diagonal su(4) matrix

diag(a, b, b,a). the dynkin diagram is depicted in fig.5a. the corresponding coroots
13we want to emphasize here that nonzero contributions from subvalleys like in eq.(4.30) to the decit
term are specic for the n = 4 theory. in the n = 1 and n = 2 cases, such localized vacuum states do
not appear, and the total decit term coincides with the proper one.
14an example of ha which ts the conditions (i), (ii), but does not t the condition (iii) is ha =
diag(0, 0, a,a)  h[su(4)]. here the variables diag(b, b,b,b) are exactly as slow as diag(0, 0, a,a).
that means that the system does not want to stay on the valley diag(0, 0, a,a), but smears out along
a larger valley diag(b, b, a  b,a  b). this latter valley does not t, however, the condition (ii).

of wa being w : {a  a} ) and the contribution (4.32) to the index is equal to 1/4.

ve dierent nontrivial subalgebras ha associated with the sets {}, {}, {, }, {, },

case (which is not surprising as the sets of roots of the algebras sp(6) and so(7) are dual
to each other) and the total decit term is 139/128.

adding the total decit term and the number of normalized vacua determined earlier
with the mass deformation method, we obtain the predictions for the principal contri-
bution to the index.

besides two methods discussed above, the mass deformation method and the functional
integral method, there is also a third way to detect the presence of the localized supersym-
metric vacuum state in the hamiltonian (1.2). one can study the solutions of the equation
q|vaci = 0 in the asymptotic region g|a|3  1 where the dynamics is described by the
eective theory (1.8).
to understand better the philosophy of this method, consider at rst a toy model.

in ddimensional space. we will assume that the spherically symmetric potential v (r)
dies away at innity as a power faster that 1/r2. then, at large r, our equation  = 0
has formally two solutions: (i) (r) = const and (ii) (r)  r2d. the rst solution is
not normalizable at innity whereas the second one (the greens function of the laplacian
in d dimensions) is if d  5 (the measure is r |(r)|2rd1dr).

let us choose d = 5. the solution of the free laplacian equation (r)  r3 is
normalizable at innity, but not at zero. intuitively, it is rather clear that, if the potential
v (r) is attractive and the well is deep enough, a zero energy solution with the required
asymptotics may be found. indeed, one can be easily convinced that the equation (5.1)
with the potential

v (r) =

(5.3)

of course, the presence of the normalized at innity zero energy solution of the free
schrodinger equation is just a necessary condition for the existence of a zero energy so-
lution of the full schrodinger equation normalized in the whole domain and does not
guarantee it yet. if the potential has other form than that in eq.(5.2), if it is e.g. re-
pulsive, eq.(5.1) has no solutions. if, however, this necessary condition is not satised,
we can be sure that solutions are absent. this would be the case, for example, for the
conventional 3dimensional schrodinger equation in the swave (the asymptotic normal-
izability condition for the function  rl1 is satised for l  1 , and one can invent
a 3dim problem with the normalized zero energy solution in the pwave, but it would
not be a ground state: the swave states with negative energy would be present in the
spectrum.)

let us return now to our sym quantum mechanics. only the theory with the su(2)
gauge group has been analyzed with this method so far, and we will restrict ourselves
to that case. the problem is supersymmetric and the vacuum wave function satises
not only the schrodinger equation h|vaci = 0, but also the equation q|vaci = 0. the
necessary condition for a normalized solution to this equation to exist is that the equation

following ref. [8] but using the explicit form of the eective supercharges in eq.(1.8)
which simplies the reasoning and the derivation a lot, let us describe how such a solution
for the n = 4 theory can be constructed. the wave function

sij =

(ij )

(5.6)

[with  being expressed via   and   according to eq.(1.3)], we will obtain again a
function of the form (5.5).

this representation is reducible. to understand it, note rst that, when substituting
(1.3) in (5.6), we obtain generically the terms of three types:    ,    , and
    . that means that, though the fermion charge is not a good conserved quantity
16, the fermion parity operator (1)f is: it commutes with sij and anticommutes with
16the precise meaning of this statement is the following.

i) the full hamiltonian (1.2) does not
commute with the full fermion charge. ii) the eective hamiltonian in (1.8) commutes with the slow
fermion charge f slow =    , but it does not help much because we are in a position to solve eq.(5.4)
involving the supercharge rather than hamiltonian, and the commutator [q, f slow] is a mess. the
solution to eq.(5.4) is not going to have a denite slow fermion charge.

33

the supercharge. thus, a wave function involving only even powers of   preserves its
form under the action of sij. and so does the wave function involving only odd powers
of  .

as it turns out, the latter presents an irreducible 128plet of so(9). this is a kind
of raritaschwinger spinvector (128)i, i = 1, . . . , 9;  = 1, . . . , 16 satisfying the con-
straints (i)(128)i = 0. the remaining 128 components of the wave function with
(1)f = 1 split in two irreducible representations 44 + 84. the rst one is the traceless
symmetric tensor (44)ij and the second one is the antisymmetric tensor (84)ijk.
let us pick up the symmetric 44plet 17 and construct our asymptotic wave function

the fermion structure in eq.(5.8) is odd in   and presents our raritaschwinger 128
plet. we may write

({k)(44ferm)ij} = ik(128ferm)j + jk(128ferm)i + ij (128ferm)k

(5.9)

substituting it in eq.(5.8), we obtain zero due to the property (1/|c|7) = 0.
the existence of the normalized at innity solution to the equation (5.4) is specic
for the n = 4 theory. let us show that no such solution exists in the n = 1 and n = 2
cases. let rst n = 1. the situation is much simpler than for n = 4 because the fermion
variables  are complex spinors in the representation 2 of the so(3) group. they are
the holomorphic variables on which the wave function depends, and one need not bother

to construct some other variables like  . the operator of the fermion charge f = 
commutes with the hamiltonian here and the properties

hold. 22 = 4 components of the wave function slow
(ci, ) are decomposed into two
singlets with f = 0, 2 and a doublet with f = 1. we see that a construction like in
eq.(5.8) is impossible and all the solutions to the equation (5.4) have the form slow
=
const(ci)f () and are not normalizable.

in the n = 2 case, the fermion variables ,  = 1, . . . , 4 belong to the representation
4 of so(5). again, they are complex and can be chosen as holomorphic variables on which
wave functions depend. again, [h e, f ] = 0, the properties (5.10) are fullled, and one
can look for the solutions of eq.(5.4) in a sector with a particular f . a 16component
wave function is decomposed into 2 singlets with f = 0 and f = 4, 2 quartets with
f = 1, 3, and 5plet and a singlet with f = 2. we can in principle construct the function

which lowers and rises spinor indices [when recalling that so(5)  sp(4), c is the an-

the result of the action of the supercharge qe

 is also zero.

however, our best try (5.11) is not an admissible solution because it does not satisfy
the requirement of weyl invariance (4.15). throwing it away, we are left with nothing.
speaking of the n = 4 eective wave function (5.7), it is weyl invariant, is annihilated
by eective supercharges and normalizable at innity. it is the asymptotic solution we
were looking for.

obviously, the function (5.7) satises also the equation

h e slow

0

(ci,  ) = 0

(5.12)

in the n = 4 theory, there is a unique lorentzinvariant function satisfying the equation
(5.12): this is how the solution (5.7) was originally found [7]. note, however, that for
n = 2 the equation (5.12) involves three extra weyl and lorentzinvariant solutions:
slow
0 = 1/|c|3, slow
0 = (c )2/|c|3. these eective wave
functions are not annihilated by the eective supercharges and do not correspond to any
normalized supersymmetric vacuum state in the full theory.

0 = c /|c|3, and slow

it would be interesting to generalize this analysis for other groups. in particular, for the
groups sp(2n  6), so(n  8) and for the exceptional groups, the full theory has several
normalized solutions and hence the asymptotic equations (5.4), (5.12) should have several
normalized weylinvariant solutions. a good educated guess is that, for the supercharge
equation, the inverse is also true and any lorentz and weylinvariant solution to the
equation (5.4) can be promoted up to a normalized supersymmetric vacuum in the full
theory.

6 conclusions.

we have discussed three dierent techniques which allow one to deduce the existence of
the normalizable supersymmetric vacuum states in the n = 4 sym quantum mechanics:
(i) the method of mass deformation, (ii) the functional integral method, and (iii) the
asymptotic wave function method. the mass deformation method is, of course, the most
straightforward and the simplest one. it allowed us to obtain the result and determine
the number of normalized states for all gauge groups.

but two other methods are also interesting and valuable. first, it is really thrilling
to see how the completely dierent ways of reasoning give the identical results for the
physical witten index whenever the comparison is possible (at the moment, the existence
of a supersymmetric vacuum state for the su(2) group is observed with all three methods
and with the methods (i) and (ii)  for higher unitary groups.) second, the method (i)

35

involves a possible weak point: we are sure of existence of the quantum supersymmetric
vacuum (vacua) for large mass, but cannot prove that all the states we have found stay
normalizable in the limit m  0. it might happen in principle that one or several or all
such states become delocalized at this point. we do not nd it probable, but independent
conrmation of our result by other methods, especially with the functional integral method
which is the most bulletproof is highly desirable.

we are indebted to a. elashvili, n. nekrasov, and a. vainshtein for illuminating

discussions.

note added. it appears that there is also the fourth method to calculate #vac which
uses the dbrane language and ideology. in the very recent [33], our results for #vac in
the case of symplectic and orthogonal gauge groups were reproduced in this way.

we will describe here how the results (1.16) are obtained and explain the reasons of
disagreement between the results of the old [2] and new [11] calculations.

the starting point of ref.[2] was the cecottigirardello formula (1.10) for the index.
however, this formula cannot be directly applied to the gauge theories where the degrees of
freedom forming the physical phase space are not explicitly singled out. to use eq.(1.10),
we have rst to resolve the gauss law constraints. consider the simplest n = 1 theory

(so that the nondynamic variables aa

restored), and calculating the fermion determinant, the integral can be expressed even-
tually in the symmetric form (1.15) (with n = 1), but with the extra overall factor
4. calculating the integral gives iw = 1 which is 4 times larger than the correct value
iw = 1/4.

the resolution of this paradox is the following.

iw = 1 is the correct value for
the cecottigirardello integral (1.10) for the index of the gaugexed hamiltonian h g.f.
obtained when substituting eq.(a.6) into eq.(a.4). however, h g.f. is not completely
equivalent to the original hamiltonian (a.1) with the constraints (a.2). note that h g.f.

the symmetry (a.9) presents a remnant of the original gauge symmetry [it corresponds to
multiplying aa
 by the orthogonal matrices v ab = diag(1,1, 1), diag(1, 1,1)
and diag(1,1,1) ] and plays exactly the same role as the weyl symmetry of the eective
hamiltonian in eq.(1.8) discussed at length in sect. 4 19. the states non-invariant under
the symmetry (a.9) are not physical ones and should be discarded.

we know already from sect. 4 how to implement such a discrete symmetry for the

path integral for the index. in the full analogy with eqs.(4.12, 4.16), we may write

the last factor comes from the potential where we have neglected the small terms  (a1,2
. this integral is estimated as  9/2g3 which vanishes together with two other terms in
eq.(a.10) in the limit   0. thus, the nal result for the index in the n = 1 theory is

(a.13)

we see that the requirement of invariance of the wave functions with respect to the
symmetry (a.9) has reduced the value for the index fourfold. this is related to the fact
that the principal contribution alone does not count the number of normalized vacuum
states, but is contaminated by the contribution of the continuum spectrum states.

in is instructive to consider a simple example of the system with discrete spectrum
where this phenomenon does not happen. take the oscillator with the hamiltonian
19it that case the symmetry was not z2  z2 , but just z2 because we were interested with abelian

classical vacuum congurations for which two of three elements of the diagonal matrix b

k vanish.

(x  x,   ). the index of the system involving only the states even under this
symmetry is given by the integral

iw = 1 corresponds to the presence of a supersymmetric bosonic vacuum state invariant
under the transformation x,   x,.
k(   ) vanish and the result is given by eq.(a.13).
this result was obtained in [11] by another method. instead of resolving explicitly the
gauss law constraints and then coming to grips with implementing carefully the residual
discrete gauge symmetry, we could write

iw =

(a.15)

where k(   ) is now the evolution operator of the unconstrained hamiltonian (a.1) (and
82 is the volume of the so(3) gauge group). the integral (a.15) automatically takes
into account only the gaugeinvariant states in the spectral decomposition of k(   ). it
is reduced to the integral (1.15) with a correct prefactor.
for the n = 2 and n = 4 theories, the analogs of eq.(a.15) lead to the result (1.15)
with the correct coecient. and the same result can be obtained by resolving explicitly
the gauss law constraints and implementing the discrete symmetry z2  z2. we have
repeated the calculations of ref.[2b] and obtained the results iw [h g.f.] = 1 for the n = 2
theory and iw [h g.f.] = 5 for the n = 4 theory which dier from the original results of
[2b] by a factor of 2. dividing it further by #(z2  z2) = 4, we reproduce the
ref.
result (1.15).
