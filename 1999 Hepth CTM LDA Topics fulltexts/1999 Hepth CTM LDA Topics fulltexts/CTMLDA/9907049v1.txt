a universal disentangling formula for
coherent states of perelomovs type

kazuyuki fujii and tatsuo suzuki

abstract

a universal disentangling formula (such as the baker-campbell-
hausdor one) for coherent states of perelomovs type (|zi = exp(za
za)|0i) which are dened for generalized oscillator algebras is given.

0 introduction

coherent states play an important role in quantum physics, in particular
quantum optics, see [1] and its references. they are very useful in performing
stationary-phase approximations to path integral, see [1] or [2], [3], [4].

to begin with, let a and a be canonical annihilation and creation opera-
tors in the harmonic oscillator. we set |0i a normalized vacuum (a|0i = 0 and
h0|0i = 1). the (normalized) coherent state |zi is dened as an eigenfunction
of a:
(0.1)

for

a|zi = z|zi

z  c.

this |zi is written as

|zi = e |z|2

2 eza

|0i = ezaza|0i.

in obtaining the last equality, we have used the fundamental baker-campbell-
hausdor formula

ea+b = e 1

2 [a,b]eaeb

(0.2)

whenever [a, [a, b]] = [b, [a, b]] = 0. maybe this is the rst disentangling
formula.

next, we denote by {k+, k, k3} operators expressing spin k (k  1/2)
representation of su(1, 1). then perelomov dened the following coherent
state

|zi = ezk+zk|k, 0i

for

z  c,

(0.3)

see [5], [1]. to this system, we cannot apply the baker-campbell-hausdor
formula (0.2), but have a disentangling formula of another type [5], [6]: for
 = (z tanh|z|)/|z| (z  c)

ezk+zk = ek+elog(1||2)k3ek.

from this we have

|zi = (1  ||2)kek+|k, 0i.

(0.4)

(0.5)

in view of these two cases, a following question arises. for a generalized
oscillator algebra a = {1, a, a, n}, we can consider a coherent state of
perelomovs type
(0.6)

for

|zi = ezaza|0i

z  c.

what kind of disentangling formulas apply to this system? such a formula
is not known as far as we know.

in this letter, we give a disentangling formula to this system and recover
the two results stated above as particular case. our formula is expressed as an
innite series, so it is not easy to nd a function form such as e|z|2, tanh|z|,
etc, except for some simple cases. therefore our work is a rst step to obtain
the real universal disentangling formula. further study will be expected. the
details and further developments of this letter will be published elsewhere,
[7].

1 coherent states

let us make a short review of coherent states, [1]. we set {1, a, a, n  aa}
the oscillator algebra,

[n, a] = a, [n, a] = a, [a, a] = 1.

(1.1)

the fock space on which a and a act is h  {|ni |n  0} and whose actions
are

a|ni = n + 1|n + 1i,
a |ni = n  1|n  1i,
n|ni = n|ni,

2

(1.2)

where |0i is a normalized vacuum (a|0i = 0 and h0|0i = 1). from (1.2),
states |ni are given by

|ni =

(a)n
n! |0i.

these states satisfy the orthogonality and completeness conditions

hm|ni = mn,



xn=0|nihn| = 1.

an unnormalized coherent state |z) is dened as
z  c.

a|z) = z|z)
this equation is easily solved to be

for

or from (1.3)

|z) =

zn
n!|ni,



xn=0

|z) =

(za)n

n!



xn=0

|0i = eza

|0i.

from (z|z) = e|z|2, the normalized coherent state becomes

|zi 

1

q(z|z)

eza

|0i = e |z|2

2 eza

|0i.

therefore |zi is written as

|zi = ezaza|0i.

(1.3)

(1.4)

(1.5)

(1.6)

(1.7)

(1.8)

(1.9)

here we have used the fundamental baker-campbell-hausdor formula

ea+b = e 1

2 [a,b]eaeb

(1.10)

whenever [a, [a, b]] = [b, [a, b]] = 0. (1.10) is a rst disentangling formula
(it is not easy to derive (1.9) from (1.8) without knowing this formula). in
what follows we call coherent states (1.9) a perelomovs type and study in
detail. on the other hand, we call (1.5) a barut-girardellos one, but we are
not concerned with it in this letter, see [8], [9], [10].

2 the disentangling formula for perelomovs

coherent states

let {k+, k, k3} be a weyl basis of lie algebra su(1, 1)  sl(2, c),
0 1 ! .

k+ =   0 1

k =   0

0

1 0 ! ,

0 0 ! ,

0

k3 =

1

2   1

then we have

[k3, k+] = k+,

[k3, k] = k,

[k, k+] = 2k3.

(2.1)

next we consider a spin k ( 1/2) representation of su(1, 1)  sl(2, c) and
set its generators {k+, k, k3},

[k3, k+] = k+,

[k3, k] = k,

[k, k+] = 2k3.

(2.2)

we note that this (unitary) representation is innite dimensional. the fock
space on which {k+, k, k3} act is hk  {|k, ni |n  0} and whose actions
are

k+|k, ni = q(n + 1)(2k + n)|k, n + 1i,
k|k, ni = qn(2k + n  1)|k, n  1i,
k3|k, ni = (k + n)|k, ni,

(2.3)

where |k, 0i is a normalized vacuum (k|k, 0i = 0 and hk, 0|k, 0i = 1).
we have written |k, 0i instead of |0i to emphasize the spin k representation,
see [2]. from (2.3), states |k, ni are given by

|k, ni =

(k+)n

qn!(2k)n|k, 0i,

where (a)n is the pochammers notation

(a)n  a(a + 1)   (a + n  1).

these states satisfy the orthogonality and completeness conditions

hk, m|k, ni = mn,



xn=0|k, nihk, n| = 1k.

now let us consider the coherent state of perelomovs type

|zi  ezk+zk|k, 0i

for

z  c.

4

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

this is an extension of (1.9). we want to disentangle (2.6). but, since

[k+, [k+, k]] = 2k+ 6= 0,

[k, [k+, k]] = 2k 6= 0,

we cannot use the baker-campbell-hausdor formula (1.10). in spite of this
fact, we fortunately have an another disentangling formula, [5], [6]:

lemma 2.1 for  = (z tanh|z|)/|z| (z  c)

ezk+zk = ek+elog(1||2)k3ek.

therefore we obtain from (2.3)

|zi = (1  ||2)kek+|k, 0i.

(2.7)

(2.8)

a comment here is in order. in this lemma,  plays an essential role and,
moreover,  is an element of poincare disk;

  d  {z  c| |z| < 1}

in contrast to z  c. this dierence is important, see [5].
have dierent disentangling formulas according to algebras.

as a consequence of section 1 and 2, coherent states of perelomovs type

now we come to a natural question: is there a universal disentangling
formula which does not depend on characteristics of algebras? in the next
section, we treat this question and give some answer.

3 a universal disentangling formula

let a  {1, a, a, n} be a generalized oscillator algebra [11], [12],
[a, a] = f (n + 1)  f (n),

[n, a] = a,

[n, a] = a,

(3.1)

where f is an entire function satisfying f (0) = 0 and f (n) > 0. the fock
space on which a and a act is {|ni |n  0} and whose actions are

a|ni = qf (n + 1)|n + 1i,
a|ni = qf (n)|n  1i,
n|ni = n|ni,

where |0i is a normalized vacuum. from (3.2), states |ni are given by

|ni =

(a)n
j=1 f (j)|0i.

qqn

(3.2)

(3.3)

these states satisfy the orthogonality and completeness conditions

hm|ni = mn,



xn=0|nihn| = 1.

now we dene a coherent state of perelomovs type as

|zi  ezaza|0i

for

z  c.

(3.4)

(3.5)

though we want to disentangle (3.5), useful formula such as (1.10) in section
1 or (2.7) in section 2 are not known for a general algebra a as far as we
know. therefore we must construct a disentangling formula for (3.5).

let us describe our main result.

proposition 3.1 we have

|zi =



xn=0

n!

(n + 2j)!



xj=0

where (n + 1, j) is dened as




(n + 1, j)(|z|2)j


(za)n

n!

|0i,

(3.6)

(n + 1, 0) = 1,

(n + 1, j) =

n+1

xk1=1

f (k1)

k1+1

xk2=1

f (k2)   

kj1+1

xkj =1

f (kj).

(3.7)

this is just what we call a universal disentangling formula in the title of this
letter. we note that (n + 1, j) satisfy the recurrence formula

(n + 1, j) = (n, j) + f (n + 1)(n + 2, j  1).

(3.8)

it is interesting that (3.7) is a bit similar to a discrete form of path-ordered
integral.

to start with, we treat the harmonic oscillator f (n) = n. in this case we

show that (3.6) coincides with (1.8). applying the well-known formula

n

(k)j =

xk=1

(n)j+1
j + 1

,

where (k)j is the pochammer notation, to (3.7) repeatedly, we have

(n + 1, j) =

(n + 1)2j

(2j)!!

=

(n + 2j)!

n!2jj!

,

(3.9)

6

so that

n!

(n + 2j)!



xj=0

(n + 1, j)(|z|2)j =

(|z|2)j
2jj!



xj=0

= e |z|2
2 .

(3.10)

because this quantity is independent of n, we obtain the following corollary.

corollary 3.2

|zi = e |z|2

2 eza

|0i.

we could recover the result in section 1.

next, we consider the spin k representations of su(1, 1). we show that

(3.6) coincides with (2.8). in this case

f (n) = n(2k + n  1),

(3.11)

we have only to calculate (n + 1, j). but

(n + 1, 0) = 1,

(n + 1, 1) =

n+1

xk=1

k(2k + k  1) =

(n + 1)(n + 2)(n + 3k)

.

the situation becomes dicult more and more for j  2.
problem 3.3 is it possible to determine (n + 1, j) completely?

here we change our strategy. in the following, we shall develop a general
theory.

(3.13)

here let us determine a dierential equation which {in(r) |n  0} satisfy
instead of determining themselves.

and

in(r)  rn

(3.14)

(3.15)

from this proposition, if we can solve (3.14) with boundary conditions (3.15),
then we can determine |zi making use of (3.12).
(3.14) becomes

now we go back to the case (3.11); f (n) = n(2k + n  1). in this case

d

in = nin1  (2k + n)in+1.

(3.16)

then the solution with (3.15) are known to be

in(r) = (cosh r)2kn(sinh r)n

= (cosh r)2k(tanh r)n = (1  tanh2 r)k(tanh r)n.

(3.17)

therefore by (3.12)

that is, setting  = (z tanh|z|)/|z|,
corollary 3.5 we have

we could also recover the result in section 2.

|zi = (1  ||2)kek+|k, 0i.

4 an application to elementary number the-

ory

in this section, we apply the result of section 3 to elementary number theory.
for the case f (n) = n(2k + n  1), we gave two dierent disentangling
formulas to the coherent state |zi; (2.8) and proposition 3.1. we in particular
consider the case n = 0 in (3.13):

i0(r) =



(1)j(1, j)
xj=0

i0(r) = (cosh r)2k

r2j
(2j)!

by (3.13),

by (3.17).

(4.1)

(4.2)

8

from these we have a simple formula

(cosh r)2k =



(1)j(1, j)
xj=0

r2j
(2j)!

,

where

(n, j) =

n

xk=1

f (k)(k + 1, j  1),
1
2

.

f (k) = k(2k + k  1), k 

we moreover set k = 1/2.

cosh r



=

(1)j(1, j)
xj=0

r2j
(2j)!

,

f (k) = k2.

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

in this case, let us calculate (1, 1)  (1, 3) explicitly.

(1, 1) = f (1) = 1,
(1, 2) = f (1)(f (1) + f (2)) = 1 + 4 = 5,
(1, 3) = f (1)2(f (1) + f (2)) + f (1)f (2)(f (1) + f (2) + f (3))

= 5 + 4  14 = 61.

on the other hand, the expression of 1/ cosh r is well-known to be

1

cosh r



=

(1)jej
xj=0

r2j
(2j)!

,

(4.8)

(4.9)

where ej are the euler numbers and are given by the recurrence formula

e0 = 1,

for example, we have

(1)k  2n

2k ! enk = 0.

n

xk=0

e1 = e0 = 1,

e2 =   4
2 ! e1  e0 = 6  1 = 5,
e3 =   6
4 ! e2   6
2 ! e1 + e0
= 15  5  15  1 + 1 = 61.

comparing (4.6) with (4.9),

9

(4.10)

(4.11)

lemma 4.1 we have

(1, j)|k=1/2 = ej.

(4.12)

but our (1, j) and ej are clearly distinct expressions (compare (4.8) with
(4.11)). in fact, it is not easy to prove that {(1, j)|k=1/2} satisfy the equa-
tion (4.10) directly (try a direct proof). moreover, if we dene generalized
euler numbers ej by

1

(cosh r)2k =



(1)j ej
xj=0

r2j
(2j)!

,

(4.13)

then (1, j) in (4.3) is an another expression of ej.

in conclusion, our work could give an another expression to some facts
in elementary number theory from a viewpoint of representation theory. we
can expect more applications.

5 discussion

in this letter, we dened coherent states of perelomovs type for a gener-
alized oscillator algebra, and gave a disentangling formula to them. since
our formula is given by complicated innite series, it is not easy to nd a
function form except for some simple cases. but our formula doesnt depend
on special skills of algebras, so it is universal !

we have not yet applied our formula to nonlinear algebras dened in
[13], [14] (in which coherent states of barut-girardellos type have been con-
structed). this is an interesting subject.

our work is nothing but a rst step to obtain the real universal disentan-
gling formula for coherent states of perelomovs type. we hope that based
on our work the ultimate disentangling formula will be obtained in the near
future.
