abstract

we complete our study of non-abelian gauge theories arbitrary number of dirac fermion-
sin the framework of epstein-glaser approach to renormalization theory. we consider the
consistency of the model in the third order of the perturbation theory and we obtain the
so called axial anomalies. however, we get some discrepancies in comparison to the stan-
dard literature. more precisely, we prove that one has to consider two group-covariant
tensors instead of the usual one.

1 introduction

in some preceding papers [7], [8] we have extended results of aste, dutsch and scharf [1],
[5], [2] concerning the uniqueness of the non-abelian gauge theory describing the consistent
interaction bosons of spin 1.
it appeared that the gauge invariance principle is a natural
consequence of the description of spin-one particles in a factor hilbert space: gauge invariance
expresses the possibility of factorizing the s-matrix to the physical space, which is usually
constructed using the existence of a supercharge q according to the cohomological-type formula:
hphys = ker(q)/im(q). the obstructions to such a factorisation process are the well-known
anomalies. the case when the spin-one bosons of non-null mass are admitted in the game was
studied in [5], [2] for the concrete case of the electroweak interaction i.e. when the gauge group
is exactly su(2)  u(1).
in [8] we have analyzed the same problem considering that the spin-one bosons can have
non-null masses and we did not impose any restriction on their number and masses and we did
not took into account the matter elds. similar results have been obtained in [10]. we have also
considered the eect of including dirac fermions and we have proved that the cancelation of
the anomaly in the second order of the perturbation theory brings, beside the relations obtained
in [7], new relations on the numerical coecients of the left and right handed components of
the interaction lagrangian. more precisely, a group theoretical property appears, i.e. these
coecients can be organised as two representations of the gauge algebra:
a with
a, b, . . . = 1, . . . , r group indices; the usual notations are tr
a . also, a representation
property

in this paper we continue the analysis going to the third order of the perturbation. the main
result is the following. the cancelation of the anomaly in the third order of the perturbation
theory shows that the usual condition of cancelation of the axial anomaly must be amended.
in fact, we prove that one has to consider two tensors, one of vectorial and the other of the
axial nature

vabc  x1,2,3=
aabc  x1,2,3=

(1 + 12 + 23 + 31) t r (t1

b , t3

c ])

(1 + 2 + 3 + 123) t r (t1

a {t2

b , t3

c })

and the anomalies are absent i we have one of the following two possibilities: (a) vabc 6 0; or
(b) vabc = 0, aabc = 0.

also a new condition on the couplings of the higgs elds appear.
we mention here that the term aabc is similar to the one appearing in the usual treatments
of the adler-bell-jackiw anomaly. however, the usual expression is given by (see for instance
[12]):

aabj

abc  t r(cid:0)t+

a {t+

b , t+

c }(cid:1)  t r(cid:0)t

a {t

b , t

c }(cid:1) .

the structure of the paper is the following one.

in the next section we summarize the
description of non-null mass spin-one bosons and construct the the s-matrix up to the second
order of the as in [8]. we also consider the coupling of yang-mills elds with dirac fermions

summarizing the results of [8]. in section 4 we go to the third order of the perturbation theory;
in [10] the analysis of the pure boson sector is performed and leads to some restrictions on the
coupling of the higgs bosons. we investigate the dirac fermionic sector and we get the new
conditions on the fermionic representations (a) or (b) from above. we also analyze briey the
higgs sector with the computational methods developed in [7] and [8] because we will nd a
supplementary condition on the scalar coupling which does not appear in [10].

2 general description of the vector bosons

2.1 spin-one relativistic free particles

with positive mass

as in [7], we take the one-particle space of the problem h to be the hilbert space of an unitary
irreducible representation of the poincare group. we give below the relevant formul for
particles of mass m > 0 and spin one.

the upper hyperboloid of mass m  0 is by denition the set of functions x +
m(p)  dp

m  {p 
r4| kpk2 = m2} which are square integrable with respect to the lorentz invariant measure
d+
2(p) ; (in fact only classes of functions identical up to null-measure sets are consid-
ered). the conventions are the following: k  k is the minkowski norm dened by kpk2  p  p
and p  q is the minkowski bilinear form p  q  p0q0  p  q. if p  r3 we dene  (p)  x +
according to  (p)  ((p), p), (p)  pp2 + m2.

let us consider the hilbert space h  l2(x +

m, c4, d+

m) with the scalar product

(2.1. 1)

where < u, v >c4 p4

the following (non-unitary) representation of the poincare group:

i=1 uivi is the usual scalar product from c4. in this hilbert space we have

(ua,) (p)  eiap  (1  p)

and the following non-degenerate sesquilinear form:

the indices ,  take the values 0, 1, 2, 3 and the summation convention over the dummy indices
is used. then one has

(ua,, ua,) = (, ),

for   l,

(uit, uit) = (, ).

(2.1. 4)

p(p) = 0}. then one can prove
let us consider the following subspace of h: hm  {  h|
that the sesquilinear form (,)|hm
as a consequence, the representation (2.1. 4) of the poincare group leaves invariant the
subspace hm and the restriction of this representation to this subspace (also denoted by u)
is equivalent to the unitary irreducible representation h[m,1] of the poincare group (describing
particles of mass m > 0 and spin 1 [11].) the couple (hm, u) is called a spin-one boson of
mass m.

is strictly positively dened.

we turn now to the second quantization procedure applied to such an elementary system.
we express the (bosonic) fock space of the system fm  f +(hm)  n0h
0  c as
a subspace of an auxiliary fock space h  f +(h)  n0hn, h0  c. one canonically
identies the nth-particle subspace hn with the set of borel functions : (n)

let us consider the following subspace of h: h  f +(h) = n0h

(2.1. 2)) which leaves the induced sesquilinear form invariant.

m)n  c which are square summable and verify convenient symmetry properties with
in h the expression of the scalar product is naturally induced by (2.1. 1) and we have a

adopted previously for the hilbert space hn we can take them to be formed by those elements
n which verify the transversality condition k1
of h
moreover, the sesquilinear form (,)|h is strictly positively dened and there exists an
canonical isomorphism of hilbert spaces fm  h.
we can dene the corresponding eld as an operator on the hilbert space h in complete
analogy to the electromagnetic eld; we dene for every p  x +
m the usual annihilation and
creation operators a(p) and a

m, c2, d+

m) and also hgh

+  l2(x +

have to introduce beside the fermionic ghosts some bosonic ghost.

we now give an alternative description of the fock space fm using the ghosts elds; we
we consider the hilbert space hgh
  l2(x +
m, c, d+
m)
with the natural scalar products. in this spaces act the usual unitary representations of the
poincare group. the fock space f gh  f (hgh
+ ) is called ghost particle hilbert
space. let us dene the auxiliary fock space hgh  h  f gh where h has been dened previ-
ously. we can write hgh = 
n,w,l,s=0hnwls where one can identify hnwls with the set of borel
functions (nwls)
0 )n+w+l+s  c which are square integrable with respect to
the product measure (+
m)(n+w+l+s) and verify convenient (anti) symmetry properties.; here
k  (k1, . . . , kn), p  (p1, . . . , pw), q  (q1, . . . , ql) and r  (r1, . . . , rl).
b#(t)
c#(t) and a#(t) (see [8]). they verify usual canonical (anti)commutation relations and behave
naturally with respect to poincare transformations.

in this representation we can construct the annihilation and creation operators a#

1,...,n(k; p ; q; r) : (x +

 )  f +(hgh

 (t),

then the elds u(x),

u(x) and (x) can be constructed; they are called the fermionic

(resp. bosonic) ghost elds.

now we can dene the operator:

q  zx +

m

d+

m(q)(cid:2)k(cid:0)a(k)c(k) + a

(k)b(k)(cid:1) + im (a(k)c(k)  a(k)b(k))(cid:3)

called supercharge. its most important property is

q2 = 0 = im(q)  ker(q).

(2.1. 13)

(2.1. 14)

an explicit expression of the supercharge in this representation can be found in [8].
as a consequence, we have

theorem 2.1 there exists the following vector spaces isomorphism:

where the subspace h has been dened previously. the isomorphism (2.1. 15) extends to a
hilbert space isomorphism:

ker(q)/im(q)  h

(2.1. 15)

(with an appropriate scalar product) and the factorized representation of the poincare group
coincides with the representation acting into the space h.

ker(q)/im(q)  fm

one can easily see that one can take the limit m  0 in the expressions for the various
hilbert spaces and quantum elds and also on the expression of the supercharge q.in this
limit we can write hgh  hgh
is the hilbert space generated by the elds
a(x), u(x), u(x) and h is generated by the scalar ghosts. then the supercharge (2.1. 13)
takes the form q = q  1 where q coincides formally with the expression of q for m  0 but
acts only in hgh
0 . moreover, we have: ker(q)/im(q)  ker(q)/im(q)h i.e. we can see
that the states from h decouple completely and can be considered physical. moreover, one
can see that, in this case, nothing prevents us to consider that the scalar ghost has a non-zero

0  h where hgh

0

mass. this observation is essential for the construction of the standard model, because a scalar
ghost eld corresponding to a null mass boson, if considered a physical eld of non-zero mass
is nothing else but the higgs eld [2].

one denotes by w the linear space of all wick monomials on the fock space hgh i.e.
containing the elds a(x), u(x), u(x) and (x). if m is such a wick monomial, we dene by
gh(m) the degree in u (resp. in u). the ghost number is, by denition, the expression:

the brst operator is dened by linearity, the action on the elementary elds:

gh(m)  gh+(m)  gh(m)

(2.1. 16)

dqu = 0,

dq u = i(a + m),

dqa = iu,

dq = imu;

(2.1. 17)

and the derivation property:

dq(mn) = (dqm)n + (1)gh(m )m(dqn),

m, n  w.

(2.1. 18)

the class of all observables on the factor space emerges (see theorem 2.1): an operator
o : hgh  hgh induces a well dened operator [o] on the factor space ker(q)/im(q)  fm if
and only if it veries: dqo|ker(q) = 0. because d2
q = 0, not all operators verifying the condition
(2.1) are interesting. in fact, the operators of the type dqo are inducing a null operator on the
factor space; explicitly, we have:

is trivial.

[dqo] = 0.

(2.1. 19)
if the interaction lagrangian is a wick monomial t1  w with gh(t1) 6= 0 then the s-matrix
the analysis of the possible interactions between the bosonic spin-one eld and matter
follows the usual lines (see [8]). let hmatter be the corresponding hilbert space of the matter
elds; it is elementary to see that we can realize the total hilbert space htotal  fm  hmatter
as the factor space ker(q)/im(q) where the supercharge q is dened on hgh  hgh hmatter
by the obvious substitution q  q  1.

2.2 massive yang-mills fields

as in [8], we rst dene in an unambiguous way what we mean by yang-mills elds. all
the elds will carry an additional index a = 1, . . . , r and this can be realized with an ap-
propriate modication of the hilbert spaces (auxiliary or physical). so we have the elds:
a = 1, . . . , r given by obvious expressions in such a way that the one-particle
aa, ua, ua, a
subspace is a direct sum of r copies of elementary heavy bosons of masses ma,
a = 1, . . . , r
and spin 1.

these elds verify the following equations of motion:

((cid:3) + m2

a)ua(x) = 0,

((cid:3) + m2

a)ua(x) = 0,

((cid:3) + m2

a)a(x) = 0,

a = 1, . . . , r.

(2.2. 1)

the canonical (anti)commutation relations are:

{ua(x), ub(y)} = abdm(x  y)  1,

[aa(x), ab(y)] = abgdm(x  y)  1,
[a(x), b(y)] = abdm(x  y)  1;

(2.2. 2)

and all other (anti)commutators are null. the supercharge is given by (see (2.1. 13)):

q 

r

xa=1 zx +

ma

d+

ma(q)(cid:2)k(cid:0)aa(k)c

a(k) + a

a(k)ba(k)(cid:1) + ima(cid:0)aa(k)c

a(k)  a

a(k)ba(k)(cid:1)(cid:3)

(2.2. 3)

and veries all the expected properties.

the krein operator can be dened and used to construct a sesquilinear form such that we

have

aa(x) = aa(x),

ua(x) = ua(x),

ua(x) = ua(x), a(x) = a(x).

(2.2. 4)

the ghost degree is dened in an obvious way and the expression of the brst operator is

similar to the previous one. in particular we have (see (2.1. 17)):

dqua = 0,

dq ua = i(a

a + maa),

dqa

a = iua,

dqa = imaua,

a = 1, . . . , r.

(2.2. 5)
if we take into account the last observation from the preceding subsection, it appears that
it is possible to make in the formalism presented above some of the masses null. in this case the
corresponding scalar ghosts can be considered as physical elds and they will be called higgs
elds. moreover, we do not have to assume that they are massless i.e. if some boson eld a
a
has zero mass ma = 0, we can suppose that the corresponding higgs eld a has a non-zero
mass: mh
a = ma.
moreover, this process of attributing a non-zero mass to the scalar partners of the zero-mass
vector elds should not inuence the brst transformation formula (2.2. 5); thats it, this
formula remains unchanged.

a is non-zero ma 6= 0, then we have mh

a . if the mass of the vector eld a

we will construct a perturbation theory a la epstein-glaser for the free elds a

a, ua, ua and
y m imposing the usual axioms of causality,

a,

a = 1, . . . , r in the auxiliary hilbert space hgh,r

unitarity and relativistic invariance. moreover, we want that the result factorizes to the physical
hilbert space in the adiabatic limit. this amounts to

lim0 dqz(r4)n

dx1    dxng(x1)   g(xn)tn(x1, . . . , xn)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ker(q)

= 0,

n  1.

(2.2. 6)

if this condition if fullled, then the chronological and the antichronological products do
factorize to the physical hilbert space and they give a perturbation theory verifying causality,
unitarity and relativistic invariance.

if one completely exploits the condition of gauge invariance in the rst order of perturbation
theory obtaining the generic form of the yang-mills interaction of spin-one bosons. we assume
the summation convention of the dummy indices a, b, . . . = 1, . . . , r. the result from [8] is:

theorem 2.2 let us consider the operator

t1(g) = zr4

dx g(x)t1(x)

(2.2. 7)

dened on hgh,r
y m with t1 a lorentz-invariant wick polynomial in a, u, u and  verifying also
(t1) = 4. if t1(g) induces an well dened non-trivial s-matrix, in the adiabatic limit, then it
necessarily has the following form:

t1(g) = zr4

dx g(x) [t11(x) + t12(x) + t13(x)]

(2.2. 8)

where we have introduced the following notations:

t11(x)  fabc [: aa(x)ab(x)a
abc [: a(x)b(x)a

a(x) :  : a
c (x) : mb : a(x)ab(x)a

here the various constants from the preceding expression are constrained by the following

conditions:

- the expressions fabc are completely antisymmetric

and verify:

fabc = fbac = facb

- the expressions f 

(ma  mb)fabc = 0,

(2.2. 17)

moreover, we have:

dqt1(x) = it 

1 (x)

where:

(2.2. 18)

(2.2. 19)

(2.2. 20)

(2.2. 21)

the expression t1 from the preceding theorem veries the unitarity condition

t1(x) = t1(x)

if and only if the constants fabc, f 
condition:

abc and f abc, have real values; it also veries the causality

[t1(x), t1(y)] = 0,

x, y  r4

s.t.

(x  y)2 < 0.

one can causally split this commutator and obtain the generic expression of t2(x, y); in
general, this is not a well-dened operator on the factor space hr
y m . one can show that this
can happen if and only if some severe restrictions are placed on the constants appearing in the
expression of the interaction lagrangian.

9

theorem 2.4 the generic expression of the distribution t2 leads, in the adiabatic limit, to an
well dened operator on hr

y m if and only if:

(a) the constants fabc verify the jacobi identities:

fabcfdec + fbdcfaec + fdacfbec = 0;

(2.2. 22)

in particular, there exists a compact lie group g with fabc as structure constants; moreover g
is of the form g  h1   hk  u(1)   u(1) with h1, . . . hk compact simple lie groups.

(b) the constants f 

abc verify the identity:

(2.2. 23)

in other words, if we dene the r  r (antisymmetric) matrices ta,

a = 1, . . . , r according to

(ta)bc  f 

bca,

a, b, c = 1, . . . , r,

(2.2. 24)

then they are an r-dimensional representation of the lie algebra lie(g) determined by the
structure constants fabc.

the representation ta exhibited in the statement of the theorem is nothing else but the repre-
sentation of the gauge group g into which the higgs elds live.

now we have

2.3 yang-mills fields coupled to matter

we study here the possibility of coupling yang-mills elds to matter. we suppose that we
are given the hilbert space of matter hmatter which should also be a fock space. then
the coupled system is described in the tensor product hilbert space fy m  hmatter. one can
describe this fock space considering hgh,r
y mhmatter with the corresponding supercharge
operator and forming the quotient ker(q)/im(q). we will consider here that the matter
is formed from dirac fermions only. we summarize the results of [8] with some new material
added. first, we have the generalisation of theorem 2.2:

y m  hgh,r

theorem 2.6 let us consider the operator

t1(g) = zr4

dx g(x)t1(x)

(2.3. 1)

dened on hgh,r

elds, verifying also (t1) = 4. then t1(g) can induce an well dened non-trivial s-matrix, in

here ja and ja are lorentz covariant currents build only from the matter elds with (ja) =
1, 2, 3 and t1,matter contains only the matter elds. moreover the following conservation law
should be valid:

the expression for t1 veries the unitarity requirement if and only if we have:

ma = 0.

a = 1, . . . , r,
and veries the causality condition if and only if:

the detailed structure of the interaction lagrangian is given by the following results. we

dene the mass matrix by:

then we have:

proposition 2.8 suppose that the dirac fermions generating hmatter are a of masses ma

the generic expression of the second order chronological product t2(x, y) can be found in

[8] and the conditions of factorization to the physical space are given in:

theorem 2.9 the second order chronological product t2 induces, in the adiabatic limit, an

moreover, the expression of the nite renormalization remains the same as in the pure

yang-mills theorem (see formula (2.2. 27)).

we exhibit now some total divergence structures which will be of use in the analysis of the

factotisation condition in the third order of the perturbation theory.

2(x, y) + i(x  y)l(x)

(2.3. 20)

this corollary leads us to a formula of the same nature as (2.3. 8), thats it a total divergence

structure for the second order chronological products.

proposition 2.11 let us dene the canonical chronological and antichronological products by:

t c

2(x, y) + t1(x)t1(y) = ac

2(x, y) + t1(y)t1(x)

and respectively

t

2(x, y)  rc

2(x, y) + t1(y)t1(x) = ac

then one has

a similar statement is valid for the antichronological product:

(2.3. 23)

(2.3. 24)

the expressions t 

i (x, y) and t


i (x, y), (i = 1, 2) have causal factorisation properties of the

same type as the chronological products, thats it:

1 (x, y) = (cid:26) t

1 (x, y) + t

2 (x, y) + t

1 (y)t1(x).

(2.3. 27)

the factorisation properties are now elementary because we have nice support properties

for the expressions r

i (x, y) and a

i (x, y), for i = 1, 2.

a deeper analysis of the relations from the statement of the preceding theorem is posssible:

t

a = 1, . . . , r,

(2.3. 28)

a = if

(2.3. 29)

(2.3. 30)

a, b = 1, . . . , r,

s
a =

i
ma

(mt

a  t

a m),

ma 6= 0,

mt

a = t

ma = 0.

finally, the hermiticity conditions are equivalent to:

(t

a) = t
a,

(s

a) = s
a ,

a = 1, . . . , r,

 = 

so in the relation (2.3. 30) one should consider only one of the two signs.

the expressions (2.3. 11) and (2.3. 12) for the currents can be written as follows:

(2.3. 31)

and the components corresponding to the signs + (resp. ) are called chiral components
of the currents. for further convenience we denote them as follows: j;

it will also be convenient to decompose even further these expression according to the pres-

3 third-order gauge invariance

3.1 causal splitting of distribution

we remind here the basic facts about distribution splitting, following essentially [9]. we will
use, for simplicity formal notations. let d(x)  s (rm) be a distribution. we say that it has the
cuasi-asymptotics d0(x)  s (rm) in x = 0 with respect to the continuos and positive function
 if for any test function (x) the following limit exists:

lim0

()mzrm

dmx d(x)(x)

(3.1. 1)

exists and determines a distribution d0(x) 6 0. equivalently, in momentum space, we say that
the distribution d(p)  s (rm) has the cuasi-asymptotics d0(p)  s (rm) in p =  if the
following limit exists:

lim0

dmp d(1p)(p)

()zrm
exists and determines a distribution d0(p) 6 0.
(a)
() exists and it is of the form
0(a) = a. the number  is called the order of singularity of the distribution. we note for
further use the following fact:

in both cases, one can show that the limit 0(a)  lim0

(3.1. 2)

lemma 3.1 if di,
distribution d  d1 + d2 has the order of singularity  = max(1, 2).

i = 1, 2 are two distributions with order of singularity 1 6= 2 then the
if 1 = 2 then the same assertion stays true if the two distributions have dierent supports.

let us dene the causal cones with apex x by:

v +(x)  {y  r4|(y  x)2  0,
and the following subsets from r4n:

y0  x0},

v (x)  {y  r4|(y  x)2  0,

y0  x0}(3.1. 3)


n (x)  {(x1, . . . , xn)  r4n|xj  v (x),

j = 1, . . . , n}.

(3.1. 4)

then we say that the distribution d(x)  s (r4n) has causal support if we have supp(d) 
n (0)  
+
n (0). we say that the couple of distributions (a, r) is a causal decomposition of a
distribution d with causal support if we have

d = a  r, with supp(a)  +

n (0),

supp(r)  

n (0).

(3.1. 5)

it is possible to show that such a decomposition always exists. we can give explicit formul

for the fourier transforms of a and r.

15

proposition 3.2 suppose  < 0. in this case, the causal splitting (3.1. 5) is unique if we
impose that the distributions a and r have the same order of singularity  as the distribution
d. moreover, we have the following expressions:

a(p) =

i

2 zr

dt

t + i0

d(p  tv),

r(p) =

i

2 zr

dt
t  i0

d(p  tv)

(3.1. 6)

where v  +
formul do not depend on the choice of v.

n (0) is arbitrary. in particular, this means that the right hand sides of the preceding

we call the preceding causal splitting the minimal solution.

in the case of positive singularity order, the formul are more complicated. we give them

for a particular but important case.

proposition 3.3 suppose  > 0 and that there exists an open set e  rm such that 0  e
and e  supp( d) = .
then, for any    there exists a causal distribution given by the following formulfor
n (0)  
p  +

n (0):

a(p) =

1

2i zr

dt

d(tp)

t+1(t  1  i0)

,

r(p) =

1

2i zr

dt

d(tp)

t+1(t  1 + i0)

.

(3.1. 7)

for an arbitrary p these distributions can be reconstructed by analytic continuation. the

order of singularity of the distributions a and r is .

we call the splittings given above the central solution. for  =  we say that we have
a minimal solution. there is a dierence between the two case, namely, for positive order of
singularity, one can nd other splittings of the distribution d such that (a) = (r) = (d). in
fact, the arbitrarines can be shown to be an arbitrary polynomial of maximal degree  in p.

we also note that if the distribution d has some supplementary invariance properties, as for

instance, poincare invariance, the central splitting preserves them.

now we dene in an abstract setting the notion of anomaly. let d be a set of distributions

with order of singularity  and with causal support. let us dene the distribution

d 


x
1

d.

(3.1. 8)

suppose that one can nd some distribution splittings d = a  r and d = a  r such that

a =


x
1

a,

r =


x
1

r.

(3.1. 9)

then we say that there is no anomaly. on the contrary, if such a splitting does not exists, we
call the expression

a

(3.1. 10)


x

16

an anomaly. the main problem in establishing the gauge invariance of the s-matrix (or in our
approach, the possibility of factorizing s to the physical hilbert space) comes from the possible
appearance of anomalies in the process distribution splitting.

we can describe rather well the expression of the anomalies in two cases and we will see

that these cases are all we need to perform the splittings in the next subsection. we have:

proposition 3.4 in the conditions described above, suppose that we have (d) < 0 and (d) <
0. then, if we apply the distribution splitting described by prop. 3.2 to d and d, there is no
anomaly.

the proof consists in simply computing the anomaly according to the denition (3.1. 10)
and observe that it is proportional to v. but v is arbitrary, so it can be made arbitrary small.

the case of positive order of singularity is a little more complicated. in general, we have

(d) = (d) + 1

(3.1. 11)

because the operation of derivation, increases the order of singularity. however, this is not the
rule, and there are cases when this do not happen i.e. we have

(d) < (d) + 1.

(3.1. 12)

this is exactly the case when anomalies do appear and we have their explicit expression

given in the following proposition:

proposition 3.5 in the conditions described in the statement of the proposition 3.3, suppose
that we have   (d) > 0, 0  (d) > 0 and
0 <  + 1. then, if we apply the minimal
distributions splitting described by prop. 3.3 to d and d, the anomaly is given by the following
formula for p  +

n (0)  

n (0)

a(p) =

1

2i zr

dt(cid:18) 1

t+2 + . . . +

1

t0+2(cid:19) d(tp)

(3.1. 13)

(and for arbitrary p by analytic continuation.) the anomaly given above is a polynomial in p
having only the terms with the degree of homogeneity between  and 0.

17

3.2 the derivation of the anomaly

in this section we will analyze the possible obstructions to factorization of the s-matrix in
the third order of the perturbation theory. in principle, there is no dierence with respect to
the preceding section. nevertheless, the details of distribution splitting are considerably more
more complicated and the same is true for the whole combinatorial argument. as before, we
will investigate the action of the brst operator dq on the third order commutator

where

d3(x, y; z) = a(x, y; z)  r(x, y; z)

a(x, y; z)  t1(z)t 2(x, y)  t2(x, z)t 1(y)  t2(y, z)t 1(x),
r(x, y; z)  t 2(x, y)t1(z)  t 1(y)t2(x, z)  t 1(x)t2(y, z);

(3.2. 1)

(3.2. 2)

(3.2. 3)

here we have put, for simplicity: t2  t c
2 ,
as in the case of the second order factorization condition, the eect of applying the brst
operator on the third order commutator is a total divergence expression. this follows easily
from the denitions given above and formul (2.3. 8) and a similar one for the second order
chronological products (2.3. 23) + (2.3. 24). in fact, a much more convenient expression can
be found:

t 2  t

c
2.

proposition 3.6 there exists a formula of the following type:

dqd3(x, z; y) = i


x d

1 (x, y; z) + i


y d

2 (x, y; z) + i


z d

3 (x, y; z)

(3.2. 4)

where the distributions d
+
2 (0)  

2 (0).

i (x, y; z),

i = 1, 2, 3 have causal support, thats it supp(d

i (x, y; z)) 

proof:
we apply to the equations (3.2. 2) and (3.2. 3) the brst operator and use the formul (2.3.
i = 1, 2, 3 :

8) and (2.3. 23). we get the following expressions for the distributions d

i (x, y; z),

d
1 (x, y; z) = [t1(z), t

d
2 (x, y; z) = [t1(z), t
d
3 (x, y; z) = [t 



1 (x, y)]  [t 
2 (x, y)]  [t 2(x, z), t

2 (x, z), t 1(y)]  [t 


1 (x)],
1 (y, z)t 1(x)],
2 (y, z)t 1(x)].

(3.2. 5)

now the support properties can be proved using the causal support properties exhibited in

the proposition 2.11 and applying some ideas from [6] (cid:4)

i (x, y; z),

to proceed further, we need some alternative expressions for the distributions with causal
support d
i = 1, 2, 3. the idea is that in the preceding expressions there are two
types of terms: ones with a factor of the type (x  y) and the others.
it is convenient to
separate them. it is also convenient to eliminate completely the antichronological products.
the result is the following one:

18

proposition 3.7 the following formul are true:

1 (x, y; z) = [r0,

1 (x, z), t1(y)] + [t 

1 (x, y), t1(z)]  [r0,

1 (z)]  [a0,

2 (x, y; z) = d

2(x, y), t

(3.2. 6)

now we present the main result.

theorem 3.8 the distribution t3(x, y, z) induces (in the adiabatic limit) an well dened ex-
pression on the (physical) factor space if and only if, beside the conditions from the statement
of theorem 2.2, we also have the following set of supplementary conditions:

(i) we have either: (a) vabc 6 0; or (b) vabc = aabc = 0. here the expressions vabc and aabc

have been dened in the introduction by the formul:

and respectively

vabc  x1,2,3=

aabc  x1,2,3=

(ii) we must also have

(1 + 12 + 23 + 31) t r (t1

(3.2. 14)

in the preceding relations, we have denoted by sa,b,... the operator of symmetrization in the

corresponding indices.

proof:
the proof is extremely long and intricate, although the idea is, basically simple: we have to
split causally the equality (3.2. 4) and see if there are some obstructions to this process. the
justication of this procedure can be found in the previous two papers dedicated to this topics
and references quoted there. to gain some simplicity, we divide it in a number of steps.

(i) if we group linear independent wick monomials, then we can write the rst distribution

from (3.2. 6) as follows:

where

d

1 = d

1a + delta

terms

(3.2. 15)

(3.2. 16)
here the (numerical) distributions of the type d must have also causal support. in fact, the
general structure of these distributions is:

here the distributions d#

d(x, y; z) = x d#
i (x  y),

1 (x  y)d#

2 (x  z)d#
i = 1, 2, 3 can be of the type

(3.2. 17)

(3.2. 18)

with the elds (x) as factors in t 
1 (x) and (y), (resp. (z)) as factors in t1(y) (resp. t1(z));
by the sign # we indicate that some of the distributions d(+) from above must be substituted
by the corresponding advanced or retarded parts: dadv(ret).

in fact, the rules of these substitutions are the following: one applies wick theorem to the

expression

and keeps only the terms where there are eective wick contractions. next, one one has to
make the substitutions indicated above in some factors. after inspecting the expression of d

from the preceding proposition, we arrive quite naturally at a formula of the type:

d(x, y; z) = x{dret

where we have used the (translation invariant) variables 1  x  z,

let us dene the distributions

x d;1,...,n

d1,...,n

x d1,...,n

(3.2. 20)

(3.2. 21)

if we can nd a causal distribution splitting of the four sets of distributions such that we

have, for instance, for the advanced parts:

a1,...,n
i

=


x a;1,...,n

i

,

a1,...,n
j;

=


x a1,...,n

j

.

(3.2. 22)

then it can be easily seen that one can causally decompose the distribution dqd
1a such that
the total divergence structure is preserved. more precisely, if we dene similarly to (3.2. 16):

1a(x, y; z) = xi,n
a

d;1,...,n
i

(x, y; z)wi;1,...,n(x, y; z) +xj,n

d1,...,n

j;1,...,n(x, y; z)

then this is the advanced part of d
the advanced part of
1a(x, y; z).

x d



1a(x, y; z) and moreover, the expression 

(3.2. 23)
1a(x, y; z) is

x a

so, if (3.2. 22) can be fullled, there will be no anomalies coming from the rst piece of

dqd3.

comparing to the results of the preceding subsection, we start to investigate, in our par-

ticular case, the possibility of appearance of anomalies.

(ii) it is important to establish a standard procedure of splitting of the distributions. we
will do this below in such a way that we will be able to apply the propositions 3.2 and 3.3 from
the preceding subsection. we have to circumvent somehow the possibility that the conditions
of the proposition 3.3 are not met. this is particularly important because if there are null-
mass particles in the theory, some of the distributions appearing in the expression dqd3 will
certainly not fulll this requirements; more precisely the point 0 will be included, in general,
in the spectrum of the fourier transform of some of these distributions. although it is possible
to modify the formula from prop. 3.3 such that these cases are also covered (see [4]), this
modication makes the analysis more complicated that it already is! we will prefer a dierent
trick.

let us consider a typical distribution (3.2. 20) and exhibit the dependence on the masses:
d(1, . . . , l). the problems are created by those distributions for which some of the parameters
1, . . . , l can be null. we rst can prove that the preceding distribution admits a taylor

21

expansion with rest:

d(1, . . . , l) = d(, . . . , ) +x(i  )

d
i

(, . . . , ) + . . .

1

+

k! x(i1  )   (ik  )

kd

i1 . . . ik

(, . . . , ) + rk+1(1, . . . , l)

(3.2. 24)

where the last contribution is the taylor rest and  > 0 is an arbitrary parameter. now it
is not dicult to see that for expressions of the type (3.2. 20) the preceding series has the
following nice properties:

- every term in the sum has the order of singularity with at least one unit less than the
preceding term. this means that is we take k suciently large we can make the order of
singularity of the taylor rest  2;
- if the distribution d has causal support, then every term in the series has also causal
support; indeed the operations derivation and of xing the parameters to the value  cannot
destroy the support properties. in fact the structure of the type (3.2. 20) is conserved by this
operations;

- all the terms in (3.2. 24), except the last one, have in the momentum space the following

structure (we use the notation p  p1 + p2):
1)g1 + (p2

(p2

1  2

2  2

2)g2 + (p 2  2

3)g3

(3.2. 25)

with i > 0,

i = 1, 2, 3. in particular, these terms meet the conditions of proposition 3.5.

as a consequence, we adopt the following standard procedure of splitting distributions of
the type (3.2. 20): for all terms of the series (3.2. 24) we apply proposition 3.5 and for the
taylor rest we apply proposition 3.4. as a consequence of prop 3.4 the taylor rest does not
produce anomalies. the nice thing about this recipe is that one can compute the anomalies for
the rst k terms of (3.2. 24) using the minimal central decomposition formula.

(iii) now we apply the splitting procedure described above and we have two cases.
(i) the rst one is given by the rst terms of the formula (3.2. 16) i.e. the distributions do
not carry the index ; the index appears in the corresponding wick monomial. it is not hard
to see that in this case we have:

(cid:18) d

x(cid:19) = (d) + 1;

(3.2. 26)

as a consequence, proposition 3.5 shows that these terms do not produce anomalies.

(ii) the second case corresponds to the second term in (3.2. 16) and we have distributions

carrying the index . there are two subcases:

(a) the index  comes from a derivative
in this case one investigates a typical term of (3.2. 20); the fourier transform of such a

term has the structure

d(p1, p2) = const.zr4

r d1(r) d2(p1  r) d3(p2 + r)

22

or

d(p1, p2) = const.zr4

(p1  r) d1(r) d2(p1  r) d3(p2 + r).

one investigates now if it is possible that ( d

x ) < (d) + 1. by applying the derivation,
in the preceding formul we get r 7 p1  r and respectively p
1  p1  r so the order
of singularity increases, except for the case when the variable r is xed in the rst (resp. the
second) case to 0 (resp. to p1) i.e we have d1(r)  (r) (resp. d2(s)  (s)). but it is easy to
see that this cannot happen in all terms appearing into formul of the type (3.2. 20). so, this
case does not produce anomalies.

1  r 7 p2

(b) the index  comes from a matrix 
in this case, we can have two subcases:
(b1) d  () f
this case does not lead to anomalies, as in case (a) above.
(b2) d = t r () f with  a matrix depending on (p1, p2).
in this case we have

d = t r (  p1) f

so the term of maximal degree in p can cancel from purely algebraic reasons, thats it by taking
of the trace.

we conclude that there are two type of terms which can produce anomalies:
(a) those of the type (b2) from above in which a trace is present;
(b) those coming from the delta terms appearing in the formula (3.2. 6). these terms have
been analyzed previously in [10] and we will mention briey the outcome using our methods,
at the very end of the proof.

(iv) we concentrate now on the anomalies of origin (a). there are four types of terms x 
1

(see (3.2. 19)) which can produce such an anomaly; let us list them:

x 

a (x)ab(y)j

1 (x, y; z) = ua(x)j
x 
2 (x, y; z) = ua(x)j
x 
3 (x, y; z) = ua(x)j
x 
4 (x, y; z) = ua(x)j

b (y)ac(z)j

c (z),
a (x)b(y)jb(y)c(z)jc(z),
a (x)ab(y)j
b (y)c(z)jc(z),
a (x)b(y)jb(y)ac(z)j
c (z).

(3.2. 27)

in these terms we have to consider wick contractions leading to traces. it is not hard to

see that in this case the generic expression (3.2. 16) becomes:

d

abc (x, y; z) : ua(x)ab(y)ac(z) : +d
1 (x, y; z) = d
abc(x, y; z) : ua(x)b(y)ac(z) : + d
d

abc(x, y; z) : ua(x)b(y)c(z) : +
abc(x, y; z) : ua(x)ab(y)c(z) : +

where by    we mean the terms which cannot produce anomalies.
according to the general strategy developed so far, we have to compute explicitly the ve
types of distributions appearing in this formula and investigate if, after applying the operator

x it is possible that the order singularity does not increase by an unit, as we would normally

d
a(x, y; z)ua(x) +   (3.2. 28)

23

listed above are, in fact a sum of eight contributions: x 

expect. if we index the two chiral pieces of the currents from the formul (2.3. 34) and (2.3.
35) by appointing an  which can take the values + or , then it is clear that every one of
the operators x 
where
i
we have denoted ()  (1, 2, 3). moreover, every operator of the type x ()
is a sum of
eight terms because we have in every chiral component we have a vector piece coming from
the factor 1
25. so, in fact we have a further
decomposition

2 and an axial piece coming from the piece 1

i = p() x ()

i

i

x ()

i = x ()

i(v v v ) + x ()

i(v aa) +    x ()

i(aaa).

so, all in all, every distribution appearing into the formula (3.2. 28) is formed of 4  4  4
pieces. we investigate a typical piece. from the generic formula (3.2. 20) one can nd, paying
attention to the signs appearing in wick theorem for fermions:

next, one should perform a fourier transform of the distribution given above and after that

construct the the taylor series (3.2. 24). we consider the rst term of the series

i.e. we put all the fermion masses equal to a certain positive value m.

after some very tedious computations the following result is obtained:

abc  d
f 

abc (m, . . . , m)

f 
abc (p1, p2) =

xi=1

f 
abc(i)(p1, p2)

(3.2. 30)

(3.2. 31)

where the three terms correspond to the three pieces of the generic expression (3.2. 25). the
structure of these components is given below:

f 
abc(1)(p1, p2) =

8(2)6 zr4

r2  m 2  ir0

=

abc;(3)(p1, p2) (3.2. 34)
where pi are some polynomials having terms of third order and of rst order degree in the
variables r, p1 and p2.

(p0)(p 2  4m 2)g

in particular, they have dierent support properties, so one can compute the order of sin-
gularity of the preceding distribution by studying the three terms individually and applying
lemma 3.1. next, we can easily establish that the order of singularity of these terms is given
by the highest power part of the polynomials. so, we have after some computations that:

f 
abc(i)(p1, p2) = vabc f 

abc(i)(v )(p1, p2) + aabc f 

abc(i)(a)(p1, p2) +   

(3.2. 35)

here the expression vabc and aabc have been dened by the formul (3.2. 7) and (3.2. 8);

by the dots we understand contributions with lower order of singularity.

the vector and axial parts from this formula are induced by the corresponding decomposi-

tion of the polynomials from (3.2. 32)-(3.2. 34) into a vector and a axial part:

abc(i) = p 
p 
we give only the expression for i = 3.

abc(i)(v ) + p 

abc(i)(a),

i = 1, 2, 3.

(3.2. 36)

p 
abc(3)(v ) = vabct r( )(r  p1)r(r + p2)

(3.2. 37)

(3.2. 38)

and

p 
abc(3)(a) = aabct r(5 )(r  p1)r(r + p2) .

now it is clear that we must study the order of singularity of distributions of the following

type:

3(v )(p1, p2) = zr4
f 

dr{[(r0 + p10)(r0 + p20)  (r0  p10)(r0  p20)]
((r  p1)2  m 2)((r + p2)2  m 2)t r( )(r  p1)r(r + p2)
r2  m 2  ir0

1

(3.2. 39)

25

and

3(a)(p1, p2) = zr4
f 

dr{[(r0 + p10)(r0 + p20)  (r0  p10)(r0  p20)]
((r  p1)2  m 2)((r + p2)2  m 2)t r(5 )(r  p1)r(r + p2)
.
r2  m 2  ir0

1

(3.2. 40)

then we should contract them with p1 and see what happens with the order of singularity.

the results are obtain by elementary computations. we have:

( f 

3(v )) = ( f 

3(a)) = 1.

now we turn to the distributions

f 
3(v )(p1, p2)  p1 f 

3(v )(p1, p2),

f 
3(a)(p1, p2)  p1 f 

3(a)(p1, p2)

and nd that something interesting, nally happens. indeed we have:

( f 

3(v )) = ( f 

3(v )) + 1

but

( f 

3(a)) = ( f 

3(a)).

(3.2. 41)

(3.2. 42)

(3.2. 43)

(3.2. 44)

the same analysis goes through for the other two terms from the formula (3.2. 31). so,

nally we obtain two distinct cases:

(a) vabc 6 0
in this case we have

( f 

abc) = ( f 

abc ) + 1

(3.2. 45)

and the distributions do not produce anomalies when we split them causally.

(b) vabc = 0
we have two subcases:
(b1) aabc 6 0
in this case an anomaly can appear. the explicit computation uses the proposition 3.5 and
goes as in [9]. in particular, only the last term of the expression (3.2. 31) gives something
non-trivial and one obtains:

a
abc =

1
6i

aabcp1p2.

(3.2. 46)

(b2) aabc = 0

in this case the distribution f 

abc vanishes and from the proposition 3.5 it follows that the
anomaly must be a constant (independent of p1 and p2). we start again from the generic expres-
sion (3.2. 29) for the distribution d
abc and observe from considerations of lorentz invariance
the generic expression (3.5) of the anomaly that we must have

a = k0p1p2 + k1p
1p

1 + k2p

2p

2 + k3p

1p

2 + k4p

2p
1

(3.2. 47)

26

with ki functions of the invariants p2
1,
be in fact equal to 0.

2 and p 2. it is clear now that these functions has to
p2

we must consider now the next term in the taylor series (3.2. 24) for the distribution d
abc .
it is easy to prove that this term can have the order of singularity at most 0 so it can produce
an anomaly which is a constant. then, the same reasoning as before applies and there are no
anomalies. the third term of the taylor series can be also be analyzed and, again, it does not
produce anomalies. in conclusion, the distribution d
abc can produce anomalies only in the case
vabc = 0, aabc 6 0.
we now analyze the other distributions from the expression (3.2. 28). we begin with
d
abc and observe that this distribution can be obtained from d
abc by making some simple
transformations: ,   1,
c . but in this case the axial part of this
distribution will be null because t r(5) = 0 so, repeating the same argument as before,
we conclude that the second term from (3.2. 28) does not produces anomalies.

b  s2
t2

c  s3

b and t3

the next two terms of the formula (3.2. 28) have the structure (3.2. 32)-(3.2. 34) but
the polynomials are of degree 2. this means that these distributions can have the order of
singularity at most 0. but in this case, the anomaly must be a constant. on the other hand, a
direct inspection of the anomaly, starting from the proposition 3.5 and using consideration of
lorentz covariance, leads to a generic form of the anomaly:

a = p
where li are functions of the invariants p2
1,
functions has to be in fact equal to 0.

1l1 + p

2l2

p2
2 and p 2. as before, it is clear that these

finally, we analyze the last contribution from (3.2. 28) i.e. the distribution d

a. first, we
prove as before that the axial part is 0. next, we observe from lorentz covariance arguments
that we must have

d
a(p1, p2) = p

1a1 + p

2a2

so

da(p1, p2)  p1 d

a(p1, p2) = p2

1a1 + p1  p2a2.

this implies that we have (da) = (d

a) + 1 and, according to prop. 3.5, there are no

anomalies.

so, we can summarize the result of the analysis for the rst term d

1 from the formula (3.2.
6) as follows: the anomalies can appear only in the case vabc = 0, aabc 6 0 and in this case,
the explicit expression in the coordinates space is

a = 

i
6

aabc(x  z)(y  z) :


x ua(x)


x ab(x)ac(x) :

(3.2. 48)

which is not a coboundary, as can be easily proved.

it is easy to prove that the second term from the formula (3.2. 6) produces the same

anomaly.

an important dierence comes in the analysis of the last term of (3.2. 6). we follow the
same line as before, and get distributions of the type (3.2. 39) and (3.2. 40). but now we must

27

contract these distributions with p because the distribution d
to z. it is easy to prove that in this case the axial part is null, so there are no anomalies.

3 is dierentiated with respect

and we obtain the rst condition from the statement of the theorem.

in conclusion, we can have only the anomaly (3.2. 48) in the conditions vabc = 0, aabc 6 0
(v) we still have to investigate the possible anomalies coming from the delta terms from
the expressions (3.2. 6) d
i . as we have said before, these terms have been analyzed in [10].
we present here briey the analysis of these terms using our technology and we nd a new
condition of consistency which seems to be missing in this references. for i = 1 only the term
i(y z)[t 
1 (x), l(y)] can produce anomalies. one can compute the commutator and select the
terms which will lead, in principle, to an anomaly. we get:

but in [3] it is proved that the rst expression is, in fact, null due to the jacobi identity.
also the third expression can be shown to be null. we are left with the other terms which are
2 and d
not coboundaries. the other anomalies coming from the other delta terms from d
can be analyzed similarly. in the end, they lead to the conditions from the statement. (cid:4)

we have analyzed in full generality the possibilities of coupling non-trivially heavy bosons of
spin one with dirac fermions and determined some restrictions of the type of the abj anomaly
which are new in the literature. these restrictions might put severe restrictions on the models
and deserve further investigations.

we end with the following proposition

proposition 3.9 the expression vabc has the alternative expression

vabc = ifbcdt r(tatd + t

at

d).

(3.2. 55)

in particular, there exist lie groups for which this tensor is not identically null.
