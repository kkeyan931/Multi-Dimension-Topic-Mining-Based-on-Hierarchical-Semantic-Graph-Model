abstract

the renormalization group (rg) method as a powerful tool for reduction of evo-
lution equations is formulated in terms of the notion of invariant manifolds. we
start with derivation of an exact rg equation which is analogous to the wilsonian
rg equations in statistical physics and quantum eld theory. it is claried that the
perturbative rg method constructs invariant manifolds successively as the initial
value of evolution equations, thereby the meaning to set t0 = t is naturally under-
stood where t0 is the arbitrary initial time. we show that the integral constants in
the unperturbative solution constitutes natural coordinates of the invariant mani-
fold when the linear operator a in the evolution equation has no jordan cell; when
a has a jordan cell, a slight modication is necessary because the dimension of the
invariant manifold is increased by the perturbation. the rg equation determines
the slow motion of the would-be integral constants in the unperturbative solution
on the invariant manifold. we present the mechanical procedure to construct the
perturbative solutions hence the initial values with which the rg equation gives
meaningful results. the underlying structure of the reduction by the rg method as
formulated in the present work turns out to completely t to the universal one elu-
cidated by kuramoto some years ago. we indicate that the reduction procedure of
evolution equations has a good correspondence with the renormalization procedure
in quantum eld theory; the counter part of the universal structure of reduction
elucidated by kuramoto may be the polchinskis theorem for renormalizable eld
theories. we apply the method to interface dynamics such as kink-anti-kink and
soliton-soliton interactions in the latter of which a linear operator having a jordan-
cell structure appears.

1 introduction

there is an ever growing interest in the renormalization groups (rg) [1, 2, 3] in various
elds of science and mathematical physics since the work of wilson[4, 5, 6]. the essence of
the rg in quantum eld theory (qft) and statistical physics may be stated as follows:
let (, g(), ) be the eective action (or theromodynamical potential) obtained by
integration of the eld variable with the energy scale down to  from innity or a very large
cuto 0. here g() is a collection of the coupling constants including the wave-function
renormalization constant dened at the energy scale at . then the rg equation may
be expressed as a simple fact that the eective action as a functional of the eld variable
 should be the same, irrespective to how much the integration of the eld variable is
achieved, i.e.,

(, g(), ) = (, g(), ).

if we take the limit   , we have

d(, g(), )

d

= 0,

(1.1)

(1.2)

which is the wilson rg equation[4], or the ow equation in the wegners terminology [5];
notice that eq.(1.2) is rewritten as


g 

dg
d




.

= 

(1.3)

if the number of the coupling constants, the theory is called renormalizable. in this case,
the functional space of the theory does not change in the ow given by the variation of
; one may say that the ow has an invariant manifold.

a notable aspect of the rg is that the rg equation gives a systematic tool for ob-
taining the infrared eective theories with fewer degrees of freedom than in the original
lagrangian relevant in the high-energy region. this is a kind of reduction of the dy-
namics. finding eective degrees of freedom and extract the reduced dynamics of the
eective variables in fact have constituted and still constitute the core of various elds
of theoretical physics. in qcd written in terms the elds of quarks and gluons, the low
energy eective theories in which gluons are integrated out may be nambu-jona-lasinio
type lagrangians [7]; see for example [8].
if the quarks are further integrated out the
eective theories should be sigma models written solely with meson elds[9]: the ow
equations, variants of the rg equation, may give a foundation on such sigma models as
eective theories of qcd at low energies[10, 11, 12]; for a review, see [13]: in terms of
notions in the theory of dynamical systems, the functional space represented by a sigma
model may be an attractive submanifold of qcd.

statistical physics may be said to be a collection of theories on how to reduce the dy-
namics of many-body systems to one with fewer variables, since the work of boltzmann[14].

bogoliubov showed that bbgky( bogoliubov-born-green-kirkwood-yvon) hierarchy can
be reduced to boltzmann equation with a single-particle distribution function for dilute
gas systems.[15] as indicated by kuramoto[16], bogoliubov seems to have claimed that
the dilute-gas dynamics has an attractive manifold spanned by one-particle distribution
function. boltzmann equation in turn can be further reduced to the hydrodynamic equa-
tion (navier-stokes equation) by a perturbation theory like chapman-enskog method[17].
recent development of the theories of pattern formation with dissipative structures gives
a good example how to reduce complicated ordinary and partial dierential equations to
simple equations with slow variables, such as landau-stuart equation, the time-dependent
ginzburg-landau equation and so on.[18] kuramoto revealed an underlying universal
structure of the perturbative reduction of such all evolution equations [16].

some years ago, it was shown by an illinois group[21, 22, 23] and bricmont and
kupiainen[24]that the rg equations can be used for a global and asymptotic analysis of
ordinary and partial dierential equations, hence giving a reduction of evolution equations
of some types. a unique feature of the illinois groups method is to start with the naive
perturbative expansion and allow secular terms to appear; the secular terms correspond
to the logarithmically divergent terms in qft; then introducing an intermediate time 
and rewriting perturbative solutions in terms of renormalization constants reminiscent of
those appearing in the perturbative renormalization theory in qft, gell-mann-low type
rg equation is applied to obtain the evolution equations for the renomalization constants
which are functions of  . finally, equating  with the time t appearing in the original
perturbative solution, they obtained global solutions of dierential equations. bricmont
and kupiainen [24] applied a scaling transformation (block transformation) to obtain
asymptotic behavior of nonlinear diusion equations in a rigorous manner.

subsequently, one of the present authors (t.k.) formulated the illinois groups method
in terms of the classical theory of envelopes [25, 26]: he indicated that the rg equation
can be interpreted as the basic equation for constructing envelopes of a family of curves (or
surfaces for partial dierential equations). he also developed a short-cut prescription for
the renormalization procedure without introducing an intermediate time  but utilizing
an arbitrary initial time t0. in latest papers[27], it was shown that the rg method can
be best formulated as the method dealing with the initial values at arbitrary t = t0; the
initial values at t = t0 are determined so that the unperturbative solutions which are
valid only locally around t = t0 are continued smoothly; this procedure is nothing but to
construct the envelope of the perturbative solutions. he emphasized that the rg method
is a powerful tool for reduction of evolution equations and demonstrated it by applying
the method to obtain so-called the amplitude equations for systems of equations. he
also suggested that if the phase equations describing slow motions in the system where a
continuous symmetry is broken, which are classical counter part of the nambu-goldstone
modes in qft, the rg method should be able to derive the phase equations.

the rg method developed by the illinois group has been applied by many authors
to quite a wide class of problems successfully. to mention some of them; graham[28]
derived a rotationally invariant amplitude equation appearing in the problem of pattern

formation. some kinds of phase equations were also derived; oono [29] discussed the
interface dynamics relevant in the spinodal decomposition, sasa derived a diusion type
phase equation, and maruo et al [31] derived kuramoto-sivashinsky equation[32]. the
method was applied to analyze asymptotic behavior of the non-linear equations appear-
ing in cosmology[33, 34]. boyanovsky and de vega also used the method to derive an
anomalous transport coecient [35] relevant in the non-equilibrium states in the early
universe and qgp (quark-gluon plasma). before that, the boltzmann equation had been
derived as an rg equation [36]. the rg method was also shown to be a powerful tool to
resum divergent perturbation series appearing in problems of quantum mechanics[37, 27].
tzenov applied the method to obtain global solutions appearing accelerator physics[38].
possible relation between renormalizability and integrability of hamilton systems was
discussed by yamaguchi and nambu[39]. the method was proved to be applicable to
discrete systems[40], too.

although such extensive applications have been made, only few works are known
which attempt to reveal the underlying reasons why the rg method works to some kinds
of equations but not to others[25]. nevertheless, it was indicated in [26, 40] that the rg
method by the illinois group works when the unperturbed solutions are neutrally stable
solutions. a decade ago, kuramoto revealed in an excellent paper[16] the universal under-
lying structure of all the existing perturbative methods for reduction of evolution equa-
tions; he noticed that when a reduction of evolution equation is possible, the unperturbed
equation admits neutrally stable solutions, and succeeded in describing the reduction of
dynamics in geometrical terms, i.e., attractive manifolds or invariant manifolds[20]. in the
present paper, focusing on the aspect of the rg method as a powerful tool for reducing
evolution equations, we shall present a comprehensive formulation of the perturbative rg
method in terms of the notion of invariant manifolds, guided by this kuramotos work: we
start with adapting the exact rg equations of wilson type (ow equations) in quantum
eld theory [4, 5] to dierential equations (evolution equations); one may recognize that
the rg method described in terms of envelopes is best formulated in the framework of
wilson rg. then conning ourselves to cases where a perturbative treatment is possible,
we shall show that an invariant manifold exists when the rg method works, and that the
rg method is a method to construct the invariant manifold and the reduced dynamics on
it in a mechanical way. in this method, the initial values of the solution at an arbitrary
time t = t0 in the successive perturbation orders are determined so that the initial value
make an invariant manifold, thereby the condition to set t0 = t will be naturally emerged.
we emphasize that the present formulation give a nice foundation for the prescriptions
adopted in [25, 26, 27].

the following should be mentioned here: (1) the relevance of wilson type rg equation
to their method was noted by chen et al[22] and pashkov and oono[36], although their
formulation was totally based on the gell-mann-low type perturbative rg method. (2)
shirkov [3] claried that the rg equation concerns with the initial values and emphasized
the lie group structure of the rg method[41]; he extracted the notion of functional
self-similarity (fss) as the essence of the exact rg. he claims that the wilson rg is an
approximation to the bogoliubov rg which is exact[3]. (3) the present reduction method

4

based on the wilson rg equation completely ts to the universal structure of reduction of
evolution equations elucidated by kuramoto[16]. although his actual presentation of the
theory was based on the reductive perturbation theory and involves some ansatz on forms
of the solutions, he emphasized that the universal structure which he revealed should not
be dependent on the perturbation methods one employs. one will see that his anzats
are derived naturally in the rg method. it may mean that his formulation of reduction
of evolution equations, which is actually a natural extension of the asymptotic method
by krylov, bogoliubov and mitropolski for non-linear oscillators[42], is an rg theory
although the term rg is not used[36].

once the underlying structure of the reduction of dynamics given by the rg method
has become clear, one will recognize that the method could be applied to problems which
have not been treated in the rg method so far although other methods are applied
to them. one will also see that the rg method is simpler to apply to them than the
previous methods. as such a problem, we take the problem to extract the interface
interactions[43, 44, 45, 46], which are typical examples to be treated by the method of
phase equations.

in 2, we formulate the rg method as a method of reduction of dynamics, starting
from the non-perturbative ow equation (rg equation). then on the basis of the per-
turbation theory, we show, guided by the presentation given in [16], the way how the
invariant manifold which is supposed to exist to the evolution equation under considera-
tion can be constructed in our method. we shall remark that the existence of an invariant
manifold corresponds to the notion of the renormalizabilty in quantum eld theory. in
3, some simple but typical examples including the takens equation [49] are worked out
to demonstrate how the rg method construct invariant manifolds and give the reduced
dynamics on them. in 4, we show how to deal with generic systems which involve a linear
operator a having zero-eigenvalue where a may or may not have a jordan cell. as exam-
ples with a jordan cell, we shall show that the rg equation gives the normal forms [50] of
the two-dimensional equations including the takens and the bogdanov equation [51], and
deal with an extended version of takens equation with three-degrees of freedom. in 5,
we apply the method to some problems such as the unstable motion in the lotka-volterra
system and the hopf bifurcation in the brusselator[52]. although the examples treated in
2-5 are simple ordinary dierential equations, we believe that these examples should be
instructive also for experts of the rgs or ow equations in quantum eld theory and/or
statistical physics. in 6, we also apply the method to extract the interface dynamics of a
kink-anti-kink interaction in the tdgl equation in one-dimension and the soliton-soliton
interaction in the kdv equation. the nal section is devoted to a brief summary and
concluding remarks.
in appendix a, we summarize rules in a scheme of an operator
method for constructing special solutions suitable for the rg method. in appendix b,
we show that the period of the lotka-volterra system [53] around the non-trivial xed
point obtained previously[26] in the rg method coincides with that extracted by frame
[55] in a quite dierent way.

2 reduction of evolution equations with the rg method

in this section, we shall formulate the rg method in terms of the notion of invariant
manifold.

2.1 the rg equation as the ow equation for initial values

2.1.1 non-perturbative rg equation

let us take the following n-dimensional dynamical system;

dx
dt

= f (x, t),

(2.1)

where n may be innity. we remark that f may depend on t explicitly. we suppose that
the equation is solved up to an arbitrary time t = t0 from an initial time, say, at t = 0, to
give x(t) = w (t), and then we are trying to solve the equation with the initial condition
at t = t0,

x(t = t0) = w (t0),

(2.2)

with w (t0) being unspecied yet. in fact, w (t) as a function of t is a solution of (2.1) by
denition. the solution may be written as x(t; t0, w (t0)). we stress that the solution
needs not be given by a perturbation method; if the solution is given non-perturbatively,
the resultant equations remain non-perturbative ones.

now, making use of x(t; t0, w (t0)) thus obtained, we determine w (t0) based on a
simple fact of dierential equations. when the initial point is shifted to t0, the resultant
solution should be the same, i.e.,

x(t; t0, w (t0)) = x(t; t0, w (t0)).

taking the limit t0  t0, we have[27]
x
t0

dx
dt0

=

+

x
w

dw
dt0

= 0.

(2.3)

(2.4)

this equation gives the evolution equation or the ow equation of the initial value w (t0).
this has the same form as that of the renormalization group (rg) equation in quantum
eld theory, hence the name of the rg method. we emphasize that the equation (2.4)
is exact; we have not used any argument based on perturbation theories. this equa-
tion corresponds to the non-perturbative rg equations (ow equations) by wilson[4],
wegner-houghton[5] and so on in quantum eld theory and statistical physics[13]: the
reader should have recognized that t0 corresponds to the energy scale to which the in-
tegration is performed in the quantum eld theory. the quantities corresponding to the

6

coupling constants will be found to be the integration constants. one will also recognize
that the existence of an invariant manifold of a dynamical system corresponds to the
renormalizability. we also notice that one needs not to equate t0 with t at this stage.

2.1.2 perturbative rg equation

so far, only the perturbative expansion method is available to make x(t; t0, w (t0)). in
this case, x(t; t0, w (t0)) and x(t; t0, w (t0)) may be valid only for t  t0 and t  t0.
this condition is naturally satised if we restrict that t0 < t < t0 (or t0 < t < t0)
because the limit t0  t0 is to be taken. thus when a perturbative expansion is used for
constructing x(t; t0, w (t0)), we demand a more restrictive rg equation as given by[27]

=

w

dw

dt0 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t0=t

notice that the demand to set t0 = t has naturally emerged.

= 0.

(2.5)

we remark that a geometrical interpretation of this equation has been given on the
basis of the classical theory of envelopes [25, 26, 27]: when t0 is varied, x(t; t0, w (t0))
gives a family of curves with t0 being a parameter characterizing curves. then eq.(2.5) is
the condition to construct the envelope of the family of curves which are valid only locally
around t  t0. the envelope is given by x(t; t0 = t) = w (t), i.e, the initial value. it is
noteworthy that w (t) satises the original equation (2.1) in a global domain up to the
order with which x(t; t0) satises around t  t0[25, 26]. in fact, one can see that

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t0=t

(2.6)

2.2

invariant manifolds and renormalizability

in this section, we follow [16] for notations. if the theory has an invariant manifold m
with the dimension less than n, we may have supposed that the initial point is on the
manifold. let the invariant manifold m is represented by the coordinate s. the reduced
dynamics of eq.(2.1) on m may be given in terms of a vector eld g by

and the manifold m is represented by

ds
dt

= g(s),

x = r(s).

7

(2.7)

(2.8)

our task is to obtain the vector eld g and the representation of the manifold r in a
perturbation method. we consider a situation where the vector eld f is composed of
an unperturbed part f 0 and the perturbative one p , i.e.,

f = f 0(x) +   p (x, t).

(2.9)

here notice that f 0 has no explicit t-dependence, while p (x, t) does. we assume that
the unperturbed problem is solved and an attractive invariant manifold m0 is easily found.

now we try to solve eq.(2.9) by a perturbation theory with the initial condition

x(t0) = w (t0),

at t = t0. the decisive point of our method is to assume that

w (t0) = r(s(t0)),

(2.10)

(2.11)

that is, the initial point is supposed to be on the invariant manifold m to be determined.
now we apply the perturbation theory, expanding

x(t; t0, w (t0)) = x 0 +x nx n(t; t0, w (t0)).

(2.12)

here we have made it explicit that x is dependent on the initial condition. we should
also expand the initial value,

with

w (t0) = w 0(t0) + (t0),

(t0) =

xn=1

nw n(t0).

now the unperturbed equation reads

dx 0
dt

= f 0(x 0).

as promised, we suppose that an attractive manifold is found for this equation as

where c is the integral constant vector with dimc = m and may depend on t0.

x 0(t) = r(s(t; c)),

here comes an important point of our method; we identify that

s(t0) = c(t0),

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

which gives a natural parametrization of the manifold m0. this is a simple but a sig-
nicant observation; notice that we need not to give any ansatz to the representation of
the manifold because we only have to solve the unperturbed equation and the integral
constants are trivially obtained.

the deformation of the manifold  will be determined perturbatively on the two

principles, i.e.[16],

8

1. the function  should be independent of w 0, and

2. the resultant dynamics should be as simple as possible because we are interested to

reduce the dynamics to a simpler one.

the choice of the  is intimately related to that of the forms of the perturbative

solutions. for example, the rst order equation reads

dx 1
dt

= f 0(x 0)x 1 + p (x 0).

(2.18)

the solution to this inhomogeneous equation is composed of a sum of the general solution
of the homogeneous equation and the special solution of the inhomogeneous equation.
if the unperturbed solution x 0(t) has a part of neutrally stable solution, there appear
secular terms in the special solution as well as genuinely independent functions. it turns
out that the secular terms can be utilized to renormalize out the homogeneous solutions
at t = t0[25, 26]; this is a kind of renormalization conditions. then the shift of the initial
value is now determined as

w 1(t0) = x 1(t = t0).

(2.19)

notice that the initial value is determined after solving the equation, hence the functional
form of it as a function of t0 is explicitly given. of course, one can make w 1(t0) = 0
by further adding unperturbed solutions; this prescription, however, will generally give
a more complicated dynamics. it means that the choice of  has ambiguities, but the
demand to obtain the simplest dynamics give it uniquely. in 3 and 4, we shall give a
mathematical and mechanical procedure to select the initial values in accordance with
the above rules using some examples.

we can repeat the procedure to any order of the perturbation. we remark that by
this procedure the modication of the initial value (t0) and hence the total initial value
w (t0) are given solely in terms of c(t0);

w (t0) = w 0[c] + [c].

(2.20)

now the dynamics of c(t) is determined by the rg equation eq.(2.5);

= 0,

(2.21)

dx

dt0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t0=t

=

x

t0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t0=t

+

x
c 

dc

dt0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t0=t

which is an evolution equation of c(t). then the manifold m (more precisely, the trajec-
tory on it) is represented as

x = w (t) = w 0[c(t)] + [c].

(2.22)

eq.s (2.21) and (2.22) are essentially the basic postulates in kuramotos theory of reduc-
tion of evolution equations[16]: thus we have derived the kuramotos basic equations in

9

the rg method; namely kuramotos theory is actually the rg theory for reduction of
evolution equations. eq.(2.22) means that the dynamics is renormalized to that for c.
one can now see a correspondence between the renormalizability of the theory in quantum
eld theory[9] and the existence of a nite dimensional invariant manifold in the theory of
dynamical systems: c = (c1, c2, . . . , cm) correspond to the collection of renormalizable
coupling constants and  to unrenormalizable operators; one may say that the fact that 
can be represented solely with c is analogue of the polchinski theorem[6, 9] in quantum
eld theory.

a comment is in order; when the unperturbed system is given by a linear operator
with a jordan cell, there will be a slight modication of the above scenario due to a
technical complexity; see an example in the next section and the general argument given
in 4.

3 simple examples

in this section, we consider four simple equations to show our formulation of the rg
method at work as a tool for reduction of evolution equations. we shall show how the
initial values at t = t0 in higher orders are determined by the two principles that terms
proportional to the unperturbed solution are suppressed and that possible fast motions
disappear. the resultant forms of the unperturbed solutions composed of the secular terms
proportional which vanish at t = t0 and the functions independent of the unperturbed
solution. the nal forms turn out to be the same as those given in the scheme adopted
in [25, 26, 27], where unstable manifolds and cases with a jordan cell were not dealt with
though. the resultant initial value represent the invariant manifold, and the rg equation
gives the slow dynamics on the manifold.

3.1 a simple model with a reduction

we rst consider the following simplest equation with a reduction[16];

dx/dt = f (x, y),

(3.1)
writing u(x, y) = t(x, y) and we expanding u as u = u0 + u1 +    , with un(x, y) =
t(xn, yn) (n = 0, 1, ...). we solve the equation with the initial value w (t0) at t = t0. we
suppose that w (t0) is on an attractive manifold m.

dy/dt = y + g(x).

the unperturbed equation reads

x0 = 0,

y0(t) = g(c0) + c1et,
the solution to which is readily obtained as x0(t) = const. = c0,
with ci (i = 0, 1) being the integral constants; we make it explicit that ci may depend

y0 = y0 + g(x0),

(3.2)

10

on the initial time t0 as ci = ci(t0). since we are interested in the asymptotic behavior
as t  , we take the stationary solution putting c1 = 0;

accordingly,

x0(t) = const. = c0,

y0(t) = g(c0),

w 0(t0) = t(c0, g(c0)),

which suggests that the unperturbed invariant manifold m0 is given by

y = g(x),

although the time dependence x(t) is not yet known.

the rst order equation reads

(t  a) x1

y1! = f (x0, y0)

0

!,

with

0

a =(cid:18) 0

g(x0)  1(cid:19) .
au 1 = 0, au 2 = (1)u 2; u 1 =  1

we notice that

1!.
g!, u 2 = 0

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

then the special solution with the initial value w 1(t0) is obtained as follows:

y1! = e(tt0)aw 1(t0) +z t
 x1

t0

dse(ts)a f (x0, y0)

0

!,

= e(tt0)a[w 1(t0) + f gu 2] + {(t  t0)f u 1  f gu 2}.

(3.9)

here we have used the relation that t(1, 0) = u 1  gu 2. for the solution to describe a
slow motion, the rst term should vanish; thus we are naturally led to the choice of the
initial value as

w 1(t0) = f gu 2,

(3.10)

to kill the fast motion. thus we have also

x1(t; t0) = f (c0, g(c0))(t  t0),

y1(t; t0) = f (c0, g(c0))g(c0){(t  t0)  1}.

(3.11)

we notice that the solution and the initial value satisfy the rules given in the preceding
subsection; w 1(t0)  (t0) is independent of w 0(t0).

11

up to this order,

u(t; t0) =(cid:18) x(t; t0)

y(t; t0)(cid:19) =(cid:18)

with

w (t0) = x(t0)

y(t0)!  w 0(t0) + (t0) = 

c0(t0) + f (c0, g(c0))(t  t0)

g(c0)  g(c0)f (c0, g(c0))(1 + t0  t)(cid:19) ,
g(c0)  g(c0)f (c0, g(c0))!.

c0

(3.12)

(3.13)

now the rg equation eq.(2.5) applied to eq.(3.12) gives the evolution equation for

c0(t);

dc0
dt

= f (c0, g(c0)).

(3.14)

since x(t) = c0(t), eq.(3.14) gives the reduced dynamics, and the slow manifold is given
by u(t) = w (t), or in terms of the components,

x(t) = c0(t), y(t) = g(c0)  g(c0)f (c0, g(c0))).

one sees that the attractive manifold is given by

y(x) = g(x)  g(x)f (x, g(x)),

(3.15)

(3.16)

and the original two-dimensional evolution equation has been reduced to the one-dimensional
equation eq.(3.14).

in short, to obtain the invariant manifold and the slow dynamics on it, we have started
with a neutrally stable solution with an integral constant, which constitutes a natural
representation of the invariant manifold. the constant moves slowly by the perturbation
and the whole dynamics is given through this slow variable. the evolution equation of the
slow dynamics is given by the rg equation and the trajectory on the invariant manifold
is given as the initial value in the rg method uniquely. the initial value in the higher
order has been determined so that the fast motion disappears.

generic systems which have a linear matrix having zero-eigen value will be extensively

analyzed in 4.

3.2 when the unperturbed solution is oscillatory

in the present subsection, we shall examine a case where the unperturbed solution has
another type of neutral stability, i.e., is oscillatory . we shall treat a simplest equation
with the geometrical terms putting an emphasis on the fact that the rg method concerns
with the initial value. we shall see that the initial values are selected naturally which in
turn give the same forms as obtained in [25].

12

as the simplest example, we deal with the dumped oscillator;

x +  x + x = 0,

(3.17)

with 0 <  < 1. this system does not exhibit a decrease of the degrees of freedom,
nevertheless the dynamics is reduced to a set of simpler equations for the amplitude and
the phase, separately by the rg equation.

with the denition u = t(x, y), y = x, eq.(3.17)is converted to

y!,
(t  a)u =  0

with

a =(cid:18) 0

1 0(cid:19) .

1

(3.18)

(3.19)

we expand the dependent variable and the initial value in taylor series as u(t) =
u0 + u1 + 2u2 +    and w (t0) = w 0 + w 1 + 2w 2 +    , with ui = t(xi, yi). the
lowest order solution reads with the (complex) integral constant c(t0);

y0(t; t0)!,
u0(t; t0) = ceitu + + ceitu   x0(t; t0)

(3.20)

where u  = t(1,i); au  = iu . this is a neutrally stable solution. the initial
value in this order reads,

with

w 0(t0) = z(t0)u + + c.c.,

z(t0) = c(t0)eit0.

here c.c. denotes the complex conjugate.

the rst order equation reads

(t  a)u1 = y0(t)

1
2i

(u +  u ),

(3.21)

(3.22)

(3.23)

with the initial condition u1(t0, t0) = w 1(t0) which is not yet known but to be determined.
the equation is readily solved as follows;

u1(t; t0) = e(tt0)aw 1(t0) 
= e(tt0)a(cid:20)w 1(t0) 

1

2(cid:20){(t  t0)ceitu +

ceitu } + c.c.(cid:21) , .

1
2i

(3.24)

13

which leads to the natural choice of the initial value

w 1(t0) =

1
2i{z(t0)u +  z(t0)u } = 1[z, z],

(3.25)

because otherwise the rst term of (3.24) gives rise to terms which could be renormal-
ized away into the unperturbed solution with a redenition of c. we emphasize that a
renormalization procedure enters here. hence

u1(t; t0) = 

1
2{(t  t0)c(t0)eitu + 

1
2i

y1(t; t0)!.
c(t0)eitu } + c.c.  x1(t; t0)

(3.26)

similarly, the second order solution is given by

u2(t; t0) = e(tt0)aw 2(t0) 

2iz t
= e(tt0)a(cid:20)w 2(t0)  {

1

+

ic
8

[{i(t  t0)2 + (t  t0)}u + + {t  t0 + i/2}u]eit + c.c.. (3.27)

thus we are led to the choice of the initial value

w 2(t0) = 

1
16

z(t0)u  + c.c. = 2[z, z],

(3.28)

because of the same reason as in the rst-order case. hence

u2(t; t0) =

ic
8

[{i(t  t0)2 + (t  t0)}u + + {t  t0 + i/2}u ]eit + c.c..

(3.29)

collecting all the terms up to the second order, we have

u(t; t0) = ceitu + 

c
2 {(t  t0)u + +

i
2

u }eit,

i2c

+

with the initial value

[{i(t  t0)2 + (t  t0)}u + + {t  t0 + i/2}u ]eit + c.c., (3.30)

8

w (t0) = z(t0){u +  i


4

u  

2
16

u } + c.c..

the rg equation eq.(2.21) gives

c + (/2 + i2/8)c = 0.

(3.31)

(3.32)

parametrizing c as c = (a/2)  exp(i), we have the equations governing the amplitude
and the phase, respectively,

a + /2  a = 0,
14

 = 2/8,

(3.33)

which yields a(t) = a0e/2t and (t) = 2t/8 + 0 with a0 and 0 being constants.
since u(t) = w (t), we have the nal solution to the dumped oscillator as

x(t) = a0e/2t{(1 

2
16

) cos(t + 0) +


4

sin(t + 0)},

(3.34)

with  = 1  2/8 being the angular velocity. the above expression is slightly dierent
from that given in [25] where the equation is treated as a scalar equation; a redenition
of the constants a0 and 0 transforms the solutions to each other in this order. we see
that although the number of the dimension of the equation is not changed, the dynamics
is reduced to simpler equations (3.33) for the amplitude and the phase. the initial values
in the higher order equations have been determined so that terms proportional to the
unperturbed solution do not appear; such higher order terms have been renormalized
away by a redenition of the integral constant in the unperturbed solution.

3.3 unstable motion in the double-well potential

next, we show that unstable manifolds are also constructed by the present method, using
the double-well potential in mechanics;

x = x  x3.

let us obtain the unstable motion around the origin by applying the rg method.

putting x = y and dening u = t(x, y), we have a system of equation

dt  a! u =   0
  d
x3!.

(3.35)

(3.36)

we solve the equation around an arbitrary t = t0 with the initial value w (t0). the
solution is written as u = u(t; t0, w (t0)). we expand u = u0 + u1 +    . accordingly
the initial value w (t0) which is to be determined self-consistently is also expanded as
w = w 0 + w 1 +    .

the lowest order solution reads

u0(t; t0) = c+(t0)etu + + c(t0)etu ,

(3.37)

where we have suppressed the w -dependence of u0 and u  = t(1,1) are the eigen
vectors of a belonging to the eigen values 1, respectively. the initial value w 0(t0)
accordingly reads

w 0(t0) = u0(t; t0) = c+(t0)et0u + + c(t0)et0u ,

which will imply that the trajectory is in a hyperbolic curve

m0 = {u = (x, y)|(x + y)(x  y) = const}

15

(3.38)

(3.39)

with the asymptotic lines y = x.
the rst order equation reads

  d
dt  a! u1 =

1
2

(c+(t0)et + c(t0)et)3(u +  u ),

(3.40)

which is solved with the initial value w 1(t0) formally as

u1(t; t0) = e(tt0)aw 1(t0)

= e(tt0)a[w 1(t0) +

with

(f+(t; t0)u + + f(t; t0)u ),

(3.42)

(3.43)

thus the rst-order initial value w 1(t0) is chosen to be

w 1(t0) = 

1
2

(f+(t0; t0)u + + f(t0; t0)u ),

(3.44)

because otherwise the rst term of (3.41) gives rise to terms proportional to the unper-
turbed solution which should be renormalized away with the redenition of c. we
notice that w 1(t0) is a function of a(t0) = c(t0)et0;

w 1(t0) = 1[a+, a].

(3.45)

applying the rg equation to u(t; t0) = u0(t; t0) + u1(t; t0), one obtains

du

dt0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t0=t

which leads to

c+ =

c =

.

(3.47)

noting that c+(t)c(t) = const  c+c, one obtains the solution to the rg equation as
follows;

c+(t) = c+e3c+ct/2, c(t) = ce3c+ct/2.

(3.48)

16

thus one nds that the global solution is given by

u(t) = w (t) = w 0[a+, a] + 1[a+, a],

= a+(t)u + + a(t)u 



8(cid:20){2a3

}u 2(cid:21),

(t)}u +

(3.49)

where a(t) = cexp{(1  3c+c/2)t}. in this case, the unstable manifold is repre-
sented solely with a and the dynamics on the manifold is given through the evolution
of these variables.

3.4 an example with a jordan cell; takens equation

as examples which involve a linear operator with a jordan cell, we take the takens
equation [49] in the present subsections.

the takens equation is given by

x = y + ax2,

y = bx2.

(3.50)

since we are interested in a slow motion in the vicinity of the origin, we make a scale
transformation;

x = x,

y = y,

(3.51)

where  is a small parameter. to make the equation to be balanced, one nds that  = ;
we choose  =  = 1 for simplicity. then we end up with

x = y + ax 2,

y = bx 2.

(3.52)

expanding as x = x0 + x1 +   , and y = y0 + y1 +  , we rst solve the equation
around t  t0 with the initial value w (t0) = t(x(t0), y (t0)) = w 0(t0) + w 1(t0) +   ,
where t0 is arbitrary.i the equations in the rst few orders read

x0 = y0,
x1 = y1 + ax 2
0 ,

y0 = 0,

y1 = bx 2
0 ,

(3.53)
(3.54)

and so on.

we take the stationary solution as the lowest order one to describe a slow motion on

an invariant manifold, in accordance with the previous treatment; namely,

x0(t; t0) = const = c0(t0),

y0(t; t0) = 0,

(3.55)

17

c0(t0) is an integral constant. accordingly, w 0(t0) = t(c0(t0), 0), i.e., the unperturbed
manifold m0 is the x axis.

then the rst order equation is solved successively from y1 to x1 to yield

y1(t; t0) = bc 2

x1(t; t0) =

b
2

0 (t0)(t  t0) + c1(t0),
0 (t0)(t  t0)2 + (c1(t0) + ac 2
c 2

0 (t0))(t  t0),

(3.56)

where c1(t0) is another integral constant. accordingly, w 1(t0) = t(0, c1(t0)); namely,
the modication of the invariant manifold is given in the y direction;

m1 = {(x, y )|(x, y ) = (c0, c1)}.

up to this order, we have

x(t; t0) = c0(t0) + {
y (t; t0) = {bc 2

0 (t0)(t  t0) + c1(t0)},

b
2

c 2
0 (t0)(t  t0)2 + (c1(t0) + ac 2

0 (t0))(t  t0)},

with w (t0) = t(c0(t0), c1(t0)).

now applying the rg equation to x(t; t0) and y (t; t0) thus obtained, we have

c0 = (c1 + ac0(t)),

c1 = bc 2
0 .

the trajectory is given by

x(t) = x(t; t) = c0(t),

y (t) = y (t; t) = c1(t),

(3.57)

(3.58)

(3.59)

(3.60)

(3.61)

which shows that the original takens equation is reproduced. this means that takens
equation is irreducible and can not be reduced to a simpler equation.

a few comments are in order: in this case, the invariant manifold is represented with
two variables in accordance with the dimension of the jordan cell although the dimension
of the unperturbed solution is one; namely, the dimension of the invariant manifold is
increased from that of the unperturbed manifold m0. the amplitude of the trajectory in
the second direction, c1(t) is small compared with the amplitude in the rst direction
c0, while the time dependence of the second variable is large in comparison with the rst
variable.

4 generic systems with the linear operator having

zero-eigen values

in this section, we shall examine invariant manifolds and slow motions given by generic sys-
tems which have a linear operator having zero-eigen values. we shall show how uniquely

18

the initial values are chosen by using a simple formula for the special solutions to dier-
ential equations as in the previous section; the initial values are determined successively
so that possible fast motions, nor terms proportional to the unperturbed solution appear.
we call these unwanted terms dangerous ones. we shall also show a necessary condition
on the type of equations for the rg method to be applicable, which condition is relevant
when the linear operator has a jordan cell.

we treat the following rather generic vector equations in this section:

tu = au + f (u),

(4.1)

where tu = u/t, a is a linear operator, f a nonlinear function of u and  is a small
parameter (|| < 1). we assume that a has zero eigenvalue and other eigenvalues of a
have a negative real part.

we are interested in constructing the attractive manifold m at t   and the reduced
dynamics on it. we try to construct solve the problem in the perturbation theory by
expanding u as

u(t; t0) = u0(t; t0) + u1(t; t0) + 2u2(t; t0) +    ,

(4.2)

with the initial value w (t0) at an arbitrary time t0. we suppose that the equation has
been solved up to t = t0 and the solution has the value w (t0) at t0. actually, the
initial value must be determined by the perturbative solution self-consistently; indeed,
u(t) = w (t) is the solution to (4.1) in the global domain. therefore it should be also
expanded as follows;

w (t0) = w 0(t0) + w 1(t0) + 2w 2(t0) +    ,

= w 0(t0) + (t0),

(4.3)

where (t0) is supposed to be an independent function of w 0. they are not yet known
at present but will be determined so that the perturbative expansion becomes valid. one
of the main purposes in this section is how sensibly the initial values can be determined
order by order.

the equations in the rst few orders read

(t  a)u0 = 0,
(t  a)u1 = f (u0),
(t  a)u2 = f (u0)u1,

where

(f (u0)u1)i =

nxj=1{(f (u0))i/(u0)j} (u1)j,

if u is an n-dimensional vector.

(4.4)
(4.5)
(4.6)

(4.7)

w treat the two cases separately where a has semi-simple 0 eigenvalues or a jordan

cell.

19

4.1 when a has semi-simple zero eigenvalues

in this subsection, we treat the case where a has semi-simple 0 eigenvalues. let the
dimension of kera be m;

we suppose that other eigenvalues have negative real parts;

au i = 0,

(i = 1, 2, . . . , m).

au  = u ,

( = m + 1, m + 2,   , n),

(4.8)

(4.9)

where re < 0. one may assume without loss of generality that u is and u s are
linearly independent.

the adjoint operator a has the same eigenvalues as a has;

a u i = 0,
a u  =  u ,

(i = 1, 2, . . . , m),

(4.10)
here we suppose that u i and u s are linearly independent. without loss of generality,
one can choose the eigenvectors so that

( = m + 1, m + 2,   , n).

h u i, u i = 0 = h u , u ii,

(4.11)

with 1  i  m and m + 1    n.

we denote the projection operators by p and q which projects onto the kernel of a and
the space orthogonal to kera, respectively. the projection operators can be constructed
in terms of u i and u i (i = 1, 2, . . . , m) as follows: let up be an n  m matrix dened
by up = (u 1, u 2, . . . , u m) and u p by u p = ( u 1, u 2, . . . , u m), then

p = up ( u


p

up )1 u


p ,

(4.12)

and q = 1  p .

since we are interested in the asymptotic state as t  , we may assume that the

lowest-order initial value belongs to kera:

w 0(t0) =

ci(t0)u i = w 0[c].

(4.13)

mxi=1

thus trivially, u0(t; t0) = e(tt0)aw 0(t0) = pm
i=1 ci(t0)u i. we notice that a natural
parametrization of the invariant manifold in the lowest order m0 is given by the set of the
integral constants c = t(c1, c2,   , cm) being varied.

the rst order equation (4.5) with the initial value w 1(t0) which is not yet determined

is formally solved to be

u1(t; t0) = e(tt0)aw 1(t0) +z t

t0

20

dse(ts)af (u0(s; t0)).

(4.14)

we remark that one may assume that the initial value w 1(t0) is independent of w 0(t0),
namely w 1(t0) belongs to the q-space, because if w 1(t0) had a component belonging
to kera, the component could be renormalized away into w 0. inserting the identity
i = p + q between the two functions in the integral, we have

u1(t; t0) = e(tt0)a[w 1(t0) + a1qf (w 0(t0))]

+(t  t0)p f (w 0(t0))  a1qf (w 0(t0)).

(4.15)

the rst term has a possibility to give rise to a fast motion, which should be avoided
and called dangerous term: the dangerous terms here are analogous with divergent
terms in quantum eld theory, which are subtracted away by counter terms, analogue to
the initial values w i here, self-consistently. indeed it is nice that the initial value w 1(t0)
not yet determined can be chosen so as to cancel out the dangerous term as follows;

w 1(t0) = a1qf (w 0(t0)),

(4.16)

which satises p w 1(t0) = 0 and is a function solely of c(t0). thus we have for the rst
order solution

u1(t; t0) = (t  t0)p f  a1qf ,

(4.17)

where the argument of f is w 0[c]. notice that eq.(4.17) is consistent with (4.16).
we remark that what we have done is actually a simple thing; we have suppressed the
unperturbed part that would be dumped out as t  .

now the invariant manifold is modied to m1 given by

m1 = {u|u = w 0  a1qf (w 0)}.

if one stops to this order, the approximate solution reads

u(t; t0) = w 0 + {(t  t0)p f  a1qf}.

then the rg equation u/t0|t0=t = 0 gives

w 0(t) = p f (w 0(t)),

which is reduced to an m-dimensional coupled equation,

ci(t) = h u i, f (w 0[c])i,

(i = 1, 2,   , m).

(4.18)

(4.19)

(4.20)

(4.21)

the global solution representing a trajectory on the invariant manifold up to this order
is given

u(t) = u(t; t0 = t) =

mxi=1

ci(t)u i  a1qf (w 0[c]),

(4.22)

with c(t) being the solution to (4.21).

21

in short, we have derived the invariant manifold as the initial value represented by
(4.22) and the reduced dynamics (4.21) on it in the rg method in the rst order approx-
imation.

the second order solution can be obtained as follows. as has been done in the rst

order case, the second order solution is formally given by

u2(t; t0) = e(tt0)aw 2(t0) +z t

t0

dse(ts)af (u0(s; t0))u1(s; t0).

(4.23)

we may assume again that the initial value w 2(t0) belongs to the q-space. a straight-
forward evaluation of the integral yields

u2(t; t0) = e(tt0)ahw 2(t0) na1qf a1qf  a2qf p foi

+a1qf a1qf  a2qf p f  (t  t0)np f a1qf + a1qf p fo
(t  t0)2p f p f ,

1
2

+

(4.24)

where the argument of f and f  is w 0[c]. the initial value can be now determined so
as to cancel out the dangerous term, i.e., the fast moving part, as before;

w 2(t0) = a1qf (w 0)a1qf (w 0)  a2qf p f ,

(4.25)

which belongs to the q-space. this implies that the invariant manifold is modied to m2
represented by w = w 0[c] + [c];   w 1 + 2w 2. thus we obtain for the second
order solution
u2(t; t0) = a1qf a1qf  a2qf p f  (t  t0)np f a1qf + a1qf p fo

(4.26)

+

1
2

(t  t0)2p f p f .

notice that eq.(4.26) is consistent with (4.25). thus the full expression of the solution
up to the second order is given by
u(t; t0) = w 0(t0) + {(t  t0)p f  a1qf}

+2(cid:20)a1qf a1qf  a2qf p f  (t  t0)np f a1qf + a1qf p fo
(t  t0)2p f p f(cid:21).

(4.27)

1
2

+

the rg equation u/t0|t0=t = 0 reads

w 0(t)  p f  a1qf  w 0 + 2np f a1qf + a1qf p fo = 0.

(4.28)

operating the projections p and q to the both sides of (4.28), respectively, we have

w 0(t)  p f + 2p f a1qf = 0,
 a1qf  w 0 + 2a1qf p f = 0.

22

(4.29)
(4.30)

firstly, we notice that the last equation (4.30) is reduced to
a1qf ( w 0 + p f ) = 0,

which is identically satised on account of (4.29) up to this order. thus, we end up with
the reduced equation given by

w 0(t) = p f  2p f a1qf ,

which is further reduced to

for i = 1, 2, . . . , m.

ci = h ui, f  f a1qfi,

(4.31)

(4.32)

the global solution giving the trajectory on the invariant manifold is given by the

initial value as

u(t) = w (t) = w 0[c] + [c]

= w 0[c]  a1qf + 2{a1qf a1qf  a2qf p f},

(4.33)

with c(t) being the solution to (4.32). notice that the argument of f and f  in the
above expression is all w 0, hence the r.h.s is a function of c, i.e., u(t) = u[c]. recall
that c was the integral constants of the unperturbed solution.

a couple of remarks are in order: (1) when the present formulation is applied to the
lorenz model around the rst bifurcation point which is simple one, the result coincides
with that given in [26]; in other words, the present formulation gives a foundation to
the prescription adopted in that paper. (2) the present formulation using the projection
operators and the resultant rg equation (4.32) governing the slow motion resemple those
by mori theory [57] for stochatic motions.

4.2 when a has a jordan cell

in this subsection, we treat the case where a has a jordan cell. we assume the jordan
cell is two-dimensional for simplicity, and we dene the normalized vectors u 1 and u 2 by

the conjugate vectors u 1 and u 2 satisfy

au 1 = 0, au 2 = u 1.

a u 2 = 0, a u 1 = u 2,

where a is the conjugate of a. the normalization condition is given by

h u 1, u 1i = h u 2, u 2i = 1,

23

(4.34)

(4.35)

(4.36)

where h , i denotes the inner product. we denote by p the projection operator to the
subspace (p-space) spanned by u 1 and u 2;namely, for any vector u,

p u = u 1 + u 2,

(4.37)

with  = h u 1, ui and  = h u 2, ui.

let q be the projection operator to the subspace (q-space) compliment of the p-space.

then one can verify that

etau = eta(p + q)u,

= ( + t)u 1 + u 2 + etaqu.

(4.38)

so much for the preliminaries.

now let us proceed to obtain the asymptotic solution to (4.4) as t   by the
perturbation method: since we are interested in constructing the invariant manifold, let
us take the stationary solution as the lowest order one;

accordingly, the initial value reads

u0(t; t0) = c0(t0)u 1,

w 0(t0) = c0(t0)u 1.

(4.39)

(4.40)

notice that we have not included a component in u 2 direction. the lowest order manifold
is

m0 = {u|u = c0u 1}.

(4.41)

the rst order solution is formally given by (4.14). the rst order initial value is

chosen to be independent of w 0;

w 1(t0) = c1(t0)u 2 + qw 1(t0).

a simple evaluation of the integral in (4.14) gives the rst order solution as

u1(t; t0) = e(tt0)a[qw 1(t0) + a1qf ]

+{c1(t0)(t  t0) + f (t  t0) + f
+{c1(t0) + f (t  t0)}u 2  a1qf + o((t  t0)n2),

(t  t0)2}u 1

1
2

where

f = h u 1, fi,

f = h u 2, fi.

(4.42)

(4.43)

the argument of f in the above expressions is w 0[c0]. the initial value can be deter-
mined so as to cancel out the fast mode as before, namely,

qw 1(t0) = a1qf ,

24

(4.44)

which implies that the invariant manifold is modied to

m1 = {u|u = c0u 1 + c1u 2  a1qf}.

then the solution up to the rst order is obtained as

u(t; t0) = c0(t0)u 1 + (cid:20){f (t  t0) + c1(t0)(t  t0) +

+{f (t  t0) + c1(t0)}u 2  a1qf(cid:21).

1
2

f (t  t0)2}u 1

the rg equation in this order is given by

0 = c0u 1  {(f + c1)u 1 + (f  c1)u 2 +

1
a

qf  c0u 1,

which leads to

c0 = (cid:16)h u 1, fi + c1(cid:17) ,

c1 = h u 2, fi.

we now see that the trajectory in the invariant manifold m1 is given by

u(t) = w (t)  w 0[c0] + w 1[c0],

= c0(t)u 1 + c1(t)u 2  a1qf ,

(4.45)

(4.46)

(4.47)

(4.48)

(4.49)

with c0(t) and c1(t) being governed by (4.48). notice that u(t) is a functional of c0(t)
and c1(t).

the second order solution is obtained, similarly. the formal solution to the second
order equation is given by eq.(4.23). let g = c1(t0)u 1 + f u 1 + f u 2 and h =


qf + c1u 2. then, a simple manipulation as before gives

1
a

u2(t; t0) = e(tt0)a[w 2(t0) + {a1qf h + a2qf g}]

+(t  t0)na1qf g + p f ho  {a1qf h + a2qf g}
+o((t  t0)2).

thus the initial value is determined to be

(4.50)

(4.51)

w 2(t0) = (cid:16)a1qf h + a2qf g(cid:17) ,

so that the fast modes disappear; notice that g belongs to the q-space. accordingly, the
invariant manifold is modied now in an apparent way; so we do not write the specication
of the second order manifold m2. hence we have

u2(t; t0) = (t  t0)na1qf g + p f ho  {a1qf h + a2qf g}

+o((t  t0)2).

(4.52)

25

applying the rg equation to u = u0 + u1 + 2u2 thus obtained, we have
c0u 1  (f + c1)u 1 + ( c1  f )u 2  a1qf  c0u 1

2na1qf g + p f ho  2na1qf  c1u 2 + a2qf  c1u 1o = 0

operating p and q to (4.53), we obtain

0 = c0u 1 +  c1u 2  g  2p f h,
0 = 2a2qf  c1u 1  a1qf n c0u 1 +  c1u 2  go .

we remark that from (4.54) and (4.55),

qf u 1 = 0

(4.53)

(4.54)

(4.55)

(4.56)

must hold as a compatibility condition, which gives a necessary condition for the rg
method to work for higher approximations. with this condition taken for granted, g is
reduced to g = f u 2.

equating the components in the u 1, u 2 in (4.54), we have the reduced dynamics as

follows,

c0 = (h u 1, f + f hi + c1),
c1 = h u 2, f + f hi,
where the argument of f and f  is w 0(t) = c0(t)u 1.

the trajectory on the manifold m2 is given by

u(t) = w (t) = w 0(t) + w 1(t) + 2w 2(t),

= c0(t)u 1 + c1(t)u 2  a1qf

2{a1qf h + h u 2, fia2qf u 2}.

(4.57)
(4.58)

(4.59)

comments are in order: the solution is solely described by the coordinates c0 and c1
representing the p space as in the previous subsection. conversely, the dynamics can not
be described only by the coordinate in the zero-th manifold in this case; the dimension of
the invariant manifold is increased from that of the unperturbed invariant manifold. we
remark that the formulae obtained above are completely consistent with those given for
the takens equation in 3.

4.3 practical way

we have formulated the rg method so that it is claried that the method concerns with
the initial values and the invariant manifold is constructed as the initial value, perturba-
tively: the initial values are determined so that terms proportional to the unperturbed

26

solution and those representing fast motions disappear in the perturbed solutions.
in
eect, the special solutions of the higher order equations are composed of secular terms
which are proportional to the unperturbed solution and vanish at t = t0 and solutions
independent of the unperturbed solution. we remark that this way of construction of the
perturbative special solutions have been adopted in [25, 26, 27]. in this subsection, having
known the above fact, we present the rules for constructing the special solutions in the
form of an operator method; a detailed account of this method is given in appendix a.
this subsection will constitute a practical summary of the results obtained in the previous
subsections.

when we try to obtain an invariant manifold and the reduced dynamics on it, the

solution to the unperturbed equation (4.4) is given by a stationary one

u0(t; t0) = w 0(t0).

(4.60)

then the rst order solution is given by

u1(t; t0) =

1

t  a

f (u0) =

= (t  t0)p f +

1

t  a
qf .

(p f (u0) + qf (u0)),

(4.61)

here (a.16) and (a.17) have been used and a1 is written as 1
a .

similarly, the second order solution is given by

u2(t; t0) =

which coincides with (4.26). here we have used the formulae (a.20), (a.21) and (a.22).
the eciency of the operator method is apparent.

next, let us consider the case where a has a two-dimensional jordan cell. we take a

stationary solution as the zeroth-order one;

u0(t; t0) = c0(t0)u 1.

(4.63)

notice that the kernel of a is not yet fully spanned by the solution. then the rst
order solution is given by a sum of the remaining component of kera and the special

27

solution;

u1(t; t0) =

1

t  a{0} +

1

t  a

(p f (u0) + qf (u0)),

which is found to coincide with eq.(4.42). here (a.17) and (a.27) have been used. the
ta{0} =
unperturbed solution
b = 0, which is solved to yield
a(t)u 1 + b(t)u 2, one has a coupled equation a = b,
a(t) = c1(t0)(t  t0), b(t) = c1(t0).

ta{0} may be obtained in the following way: putting

1

1

the second order solution is given by

u2(t; t0) =

=

f (u0)u1(t; t0),

(p + q)f (u0)u1(t; t0).

(4.65)

1

1

t  a
t  a

then the r.h.s. is a sum of terms which are in the form 1
ta (t 
t0)nqg(u0), which are calculated in appendix a. actually, since terms proportional to
(t  t0)n (n  2) do not contribute to the rg equation nor to the resulting trajectory,
one needs not calculate the terms of the form 1
ta(t  t0)np g(u0) with n  1. thus we
easily reach the nal result given in (4.52).

ta (t  t0)np g(u0) or

1

4.4 normal form

as a simple example, we try to reduce the following two-dimensional evolution equation
with a jordan cell;

x = y + a1x2 + b1xy + c1y2,

y = a2x2 + b2xy + c2y2,

(4.66)

with ai, bi and ci (i = 1, 2) being constant. as in the takens equation examined in 3,
we make a scale transformation

then the equation is reduced to

x = x,

y = y.

where

(t  a)u = f (u), u = t(x, y ),
a2x 2 + b2xy + c2y 2!.
0 0(cid:19) , f (u) = a1x 2 + b1xy + c1y 2

a =(cid:18) 0 1

28

(4.67)

(4.68)

(4.69)

here the p-space is spanned by

0!,
u 1 = 1

1!,
and u 2 = 0

(4.70)

which satisfy au 1 = 0 and au 2 = u 1. and u i = u i (i = 1, 2).

expanding as u = u0 + u1 +    , with ui = t(xi, yi), we rst solve the equation

around t  t0 with the initial value w (t0) = w 0(t0) + w 1(t0) +   .

we take the stationary solution as the lowest order

u0(t; t0) = a0(t0)u 1,

(4.71)

where a0(t0) is an integral constant. accordingly, w 0(t0) = t(a0(t0), 0); the unperturbed
manifold is the x axis.

according to the general argument given in 4.2, we need to calculate the following

quantities;

f = h u 1, f (u0)i = a1a2

0(t0),

f = h u 2, f (u0)i = a2a2

0(t0).

(4.72)

notice that qf (u0) = 0, identically. then one has

a2
u1(t; t0) = {a1(t0)(1 + a1a1(t0))(t  t0) +
2
0(t0)(t  t0)}u 2,

+{a1(t0) + a2a2

0(t0)(t  t0)2}u 1
a2

(4.73)

where a1(t0) is another integral constant. accordingly, w 1(t0) = t(0, a1(t0)). then

if we stop at this order, the rg equation reads

m1 = {u|u = t(a0, a1)}.

a0 = (a1 + a1a2

0),

a1 = a2a2
0.

(4.74)

(4.75)

this is the takens equation; notice the trajectory is given by x(t) = x(t; t) = a0(t), y(t) =
y (t; t) = 2a1(t). it means that the rg method gives mechanically the normal form [50]
of the reduced equation. this is conrmed by proceeding to the second order.

in the present case, g = 0 and h = a1(t0)u 2, and

p f (u0)h = a1{b1a0u 1 + b2a0u 2}.

then the second order solution is found to be given by

u2(t; t0) = (t  t0)a1{b1a0u 1 + b2a0u 2} + o((t  t0)n2),

accordingly, w 2(t0) = 0.

(4.76)

(4.77)

29

up to this order, we have u = u0 + u1 + 2u2. then the rg equation reads

a0 = a1 + (a1a2
a1 = a2a2

0 + b2a0a1,

0 + b1a0a1),

(4.78)

which is the normal form when the linear matrix is of jordan form[50]. the trajectory
is given by x(t) = a0(t), y(t) = 2a1(t). thus one sees that the rg equation gives the
normal form of the reduced evolution equation on the invariant manifold. we remark
that when a1 = b1 = 0, the rg equation is nothing but the bogdanov equation[51].

we remark that one needs the second order solution to give the bogdanov equation,

while the takens equation is obtained in the rst approximation.

4.5 an extended takens equation

as the nal example, we deal with an extension of the takens equation to a system with
three-degrees of freedom;

x = y + ax2,

y = bx2,

z = z + f (x, y, z),

(4.79)

where f (x, y, z) is analytic function of (x, y, z). we shall show the compatibility condi-
tion (4.56), which becomes relevant only when the system has more than two-degrees of
freedom, gives a restriction to the form of f (x, y, z).

with u = t(x, y, z), (4.79) is converted to

where

(t  a)u = f (u),

a =

0 1 0
0 0 0
0 0  1

 , f (u) =

ax2
bx2

f (x, y, z)

 .

notice that a has a two-dimensional jordan cell;

au 1 = 0, au 2 = u 1, au 3 = u 3,

(4.80)

(4.81)

(4.82)

where u 1 = t(1, 0, 0), u 2 = t(0, 1, 0), u 3 = t(0, 0, 1). the projection operator to the
subspace {u 1, u 2} is given by p = diag(1, 1, 0), while q = 1  p = diag(0, 0, 1). we
also notice that u i = u i (i = 1, 2) in this simple example. we are interested in the
asymptotic behavior of the solution at t  . we rst solve (4.80) around t  t0 with
the initial value w (t0) at t = t0 by the perturbation theory. the solution may be written
as u(t; t0, w (t0)), which is expanded as u = u0 + u1 + 2u2 +   . the initial value which
is determined self-consistently with u is also expanded as w = w 0 + w 1 + 2w 2 +   .

30

when t  , we may take the stationary solution as an asymptotic one to the lowest

order equation;

u0(t; t0) = c0(t0)u 1.

(4.83)

accordingly the initial value reads w 0(t0) = c0(t0)u 1, which implies that the unper-
turbed invariant manifold is given by

m0 = {u|u = c0u 1},

(4.84)

namely the x axis.

according to the general formulation given in the previous sections, to obtain the rst

order solution, we only have to evaluate

f = h u 1, f (u0)i = ac 2

0 (t0),

a1qf (u0) = f (u0)u 3.

f = h u 2, f (u0)i = bc 2

0 (t0),

then we end up with

u1(t; t0) = {ac 2
+{bc 2

0 (t0)(t  t0) + c1(t0)(t  t0) +
0 (t0)(t  t0) + c1(t0)}u 2 + f (u0)u 3.

1
2

bc 2

0 (t0)(t  t0)2}u 1

accordingly,

w 1(t0) = c1(t0)u 2 + f (u0)u 3,

which implies that the modied invariant manifold is given by

m1 = {u|u = t(c0, c1, f (c0, 0, 0))}.

(4.85)

(4.86)

(4.87)

(4.88)

if we stop at this order, the full solution is given by u  u0 + u1. applying the rg

equation, we have

c0 = (ac 2

0 + c1),

c1 = bc 2
0 .

(4.89)

and the trajectory on the manifold mm1 is given by

u(t) = c0(t)u 1 + c1(t)u 2 + f (c0(t), 0, 0)u 3.

(4.90)

to go to the second order, we need rst to examine the compatibility condition;

0 = qf (u0)u 1 =

f (x, y, z)

x

u 3,

(4.91)

with u0 = t(c0, 0, 0), which means that when y = z = 0, f (x, y, z) does not depend on
x.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)u=u0

31

with this condition assumed, we can proceed to the second order. to obtain the second
order rg equation, we notice the following; h = a1qf (u0)+c1u 2 = f (u0)u 3 +c1u 2
and hence f (u0)h = 0. thus the rg equation which gives the evolution equation of
c0,1(t) is not modied by the second order perturbation.

to obtain the second order correction to the trajectory, we need to evaluate the fol-

lowing;

 a1qf h = (f (u0)
f
a2qf u 2 = 
u 3,
y

f
z

+ c1

f
y

)u 3,

(4.92)

where the derivatives are evaluated at u = u0 = t(c0(t), 0, 0). thus the second order
correction of the initial value reads

w 2(t0) = (f (u0)

f
z

+ c1

f
y  f

f
y

)u 3.

hence the trajectory in the second order approximation is given by

u(t) = w (t) = c0(t)u 1 + c1(t)u 2 + f (u0)u 3

+2(f (u0)

f
z

+ c1

f
y  f

f
y

)u 3.

(4.93)

(4.94)

here c0,1(t) are governed by the takens equation (4.89). we see that the higher order
terms does not aect the dynamics but modies the trajectory only in the u 2 and the
q-direction.

similar discussions can be made for the following extended bogdanov equation,

x = y,

y = ax2 + bxy,

z = z + f (x, y, z),

(4.95)

where f (x, y, z) is an analytic function.

4.6 discussion

we have applied the naive perturbative expansion as the starting point of the rg method.
however, the naive perturbation expansion is not always a good starting point. there are
cases where a scaling transformation is needed to convert the unperturbed equation to a
non-jordan form before applying the perturbative expansion. let us take the following
example;

u =(cid:18) 0 1  

 0 (cid:19) u,

32

(4.96)

with u = t(x, y). the exact solution reads

u(t) = aetu + + betu ,
where  =q(1  ) and u  = t(1,q/(1  )); i.e.,

x(t) = aet + bet, y(t) =q/(1  )  (aet  bet).

(4.97)

(4.98)

due to the appearance of the singular term , the naive perturbation does not give
a sensible result even in the rg method. in this case, we rst try to convert the equation
so that the converted equation has no jordan nature in the unperturbed part. this can
be performed by a scale transformation; x = ,
t =  . to make the
unperturbed part to be a non-jordan form, we choose that    +  = 1 +   +  = 0,
which is satised with  = 0,  =  = 1/2, i.e., x = , y = ,
t =  /. the
converted equation reads

y = ,

d
d

=   ,

d
d

= ,

(4.99)

which can be now solved by the rg method with no diculty. the result obtained by
the rg method up to o(2) reads

x(t) = aet + bet, y(t) = (1 + /2)(aet  bet),

with  = (1  /2).

(4.100)

5 applications i

in this section, we present examples of non-linear equations for which the unperturbed
linear operator has no zero eigenvalues but a pair of eigenvalues i (i = 1, 2); (i) 1,2 = i
and (ii) 1,2 =  where  and  are real numbers. the rst case is discussed in [25, 26]
as well as in 3. we present it here for completeness.

5.1 brusselator

this is an example of systems showing a hopf bifurcation. an rg treatment of generic
systems with a bifurcation has been given in [26] where an emphasis is put on the relation
of the rg method with the envelope theory. here we treat this interesting example in
the present formulation emphasizing the aspect of the rg method as the one to construct
attractive manifolds.

the brusselator is given by

x

y
t

= a  (b + 1)x + x 2y + dx
= bx  x 2y + dy

2y
x2 ,

2x
x2 ,

(5.1)

where a(> 0), b(> 0), dx and dy are constant. we here treat a uniform system, hence
the terms with the spatial derivatives vanish. the steady state is given by (x0, y0) =
(a, b/a). shifting the variables as  = x  x0,  = y  y0, and dening u = t(, ),
we have

with

d
dt

u =(cid:18) (b  1) + a2

b  a2 (cid:19) + f (, )(cid:18) 1
1(cid:19) ,

f (, ) = b/a  2 + 2a + 2.

(5.2)

(5.3)

the linear stability analysis shows that when b exceeds the critical value bc = 1 + a2,
there arises a bifurcation.

now let us analyze the slow motion and the slow manifold around the bifurcation

(critical) point. we dene the following variables

 = (b  bc)/bc,  =q||, and  = sgn(),

(5.4)

accordingly,  = 2. we rst expand u and the initial value u(t = t0; t0) = w (t0) as
taylor series w.r.t : u = u1 + 2u2 + 3u3 +   , and w = w 1 + 2w 2 + 3w 3 +   .

the rst order equation reads

(t  l0)u1 = 0,

with

l0 =(cid:18) a2

(a2 + 1)  a2(cid:19) .

the solution is readily found to be

u(t; t0) = c(t0)u eit + c.c.,

with  = a and

u =(cid:18) 1

here c is the (complex) integral constant. accordingly,

w 1(t0) = c(t0)u eit0 + c.c..

5.2 unstable motion in lotkavolterra system

the lotka-volterra (lv) equation[53] is known to be integrable, although the exact ana-
lytic solutions of it are not known. the equation was already treated in the rg method
by one of the present authors (tk), and an approximate solution was constructed explic-
itly around the non-trivial xed point[26]. a numerical comparison of the results with
the exact solution shows that the solution given by the rg method well approximates
the exact solution in a global domain even when the small parameter in the equation , 
(see below) are as large as 0.8 [54]. the purpose of the present subsection is to apply the
rg method for analyzing the equation around the unstable xed point (the origin).

lotkavolterra equation reads

( x = ax  xy
y = by + xy

(5.19)

here,x = x(t),y = y(t) and a, b, ,  are positive constants. in this work, we treat the case
where 0 <  < 1 and 0 <  < 1 so that the perturbation theory can be applied.

there are two xed points; (i) x = y = 0 and (ii) x = b/,

y = a/. one can see
that the xed point (i) is asymptotically unstable. an approximate but globally valid
solution around the second xed point was obtained in [26]. in this paper, we treat the
rst xed point.

with the new variables dened by x = 

 ,

y =  (5.19) is converted to

du
dt

= au + f (u),

36

(5.20)

where

u = 

!, a =  a 0

1!.
0 b ! , f (u) =   1

(5.21)

one see that the xed point (i) is asymptotically unstable in the linear approximation.
our aim here is to obtain the dynamics around the unstable xed point and construct
the unstable manifold using the rg method.

for later convenience, we introduce the normalized eigenvectors of a;

where u 1 = t(1, 0) and u 2 = t(0, 1).

au 1 = au 1, au 2 = bu 2,

(5.22)

now let us apply the rg method to construct an approximate solution valid in a global
domain. we suppose that the equation is solved up to arbitrary t = t0 from the time,
say t = 0, at which the genuine initial condition is imposed. with this up-to-dated initial
value w (t0), we try to construct the solution to (5.20) around t  t0 by the perturbation
theory, expanding u as u = u0+u1+2u2+0(2). thus u may be written as u = u(t; t0).
we also expand the initial value w (t0) = w 0 + w 1 + 2w 2 + o(3).

the equations to be solved are

(

d

(5.23)

(5.24)

(5.25)

and so on, where t(i, i) = ui (i = 0, 1, 2...). it turns out that one needs to treat sepa-
rately depending on whether a 6= b or a = b.

case a: a = b

this is the interesting case where secular terms appear and the rg method plays a role
to construct an approximate solution in a global domain. the unperturbed solution reads

u0 = c1(t0)eatu 1 + c2(t0)eatu 2,

(5.26)

implying the initial condition w 0(t0) = c1(t0)eat0 u 1 + c2(t0)eat0 u 2. the rst order
solution now reads

1

u1 = c1c2
= w 1(t0),

t  a

(u 1  u 2) =

c1c2

a

(u 1 + u 2),

(5.27)

which is constant and independent of u0(t).

37

using the formulae in appendix a, the second order solution is also obtained. col-
lecting all the terms thus obtained, we have an approximate solution valid around t  t0;

c1c2

u(t : t0) = c1(t0)eatu 1 + c2(t0)eatu 2 +

(5.33)

here, the constants c1 and c2 are determined by the initial condition imposed at t = 0.

some remarks are in order: (1) our solution (5.31) shows that the speed to approach
to and to escape from the origin is shifted from a to a 2c1c2/a  , which is dependent
(2) the unstable manifold can be
on the initial condition as expressed by c1 and c2.
constructed explicitly from (5.32) and (5.33). solving et and et from these equations
and making the product of them, we have

c = (x  y )(y  x),

(5.34)

where x = 
a . (5.34) shows that the
unstable manifold is the hyperbolic curve which has the non-orthognal asymptotic lines
coming out of the point t(x0, x0) with the slopes  and 1/, respectively .

6 applications ii: pulse interactions

in this section, we apply the rg method to obtain the dynamics of interacting pulses
(or fronts) in one dimension. some yeas ago, a systematic method was developed by ei
and ohta[45] to this problem on the basis of the phase dynamics approach [19] which
involves a solvability condition. we shall show how the dynamics of interacting pulses
obtained by them can be derived mechanically in the present method virtually without
any assumptions. in other words, we shall derive the phase equations describing the front
and pulse interactions in the rg method for the rst time, although interface dynamics in
spinodal decomposition[29], a diusion equation[30] and kuramoto-shivashinski equation
[31] as the phase equations have been derived in the rg method by others. as repre-
sentative examples of pulse dynamics, we take up the kink-antikink interactions in the
time-dependent ginzburg-landau (tdgl) equation and the soliton-soliton interaction in
the kortweg-de vries (kdv) equation.

6.1 kink-anti-kink interaction in tdgl equation

the tdgl equation we study is given by

with

u
t

= 2 2u

x2 + f (u),

f (u) =

1
2

u(1  u2),

(6.1)

(6.2)

where u = u(x, t) is a real scalar function and  < 1. we remark that (6.1) has a stationary
solution

u(x, t) =  tanh

x  h
2  u(x  h),

(6.3)

where u(x) satises u() = 1 and u(0) = 0. u(x  h) (u(x  h)) is called a kink
(an antikink) at the position x = h.

6.1.1 interaction of one kink and antikink

we rst consider the interaction of one kink and antikink. suppose the initial data at
t = 0 are given by

u0(x; x1(0), x2(0)) = u(x  x1(0)) + {u(x  x2(0))  1},

40

where x2(0)  x1(0) >> ; i.e., the kink (antikink) is located at x = a (x = b). since
u0(x; x1(0), x2(0)) is not a solution to eq.(6.1), the position of the kink x1 and the antikink
x2 will move slowly. our task is to nd the equation governing the dynamics of x1(t) and
x2(t) at t > 0.

to apply the rg method to solve this problem, we rst identify the small parameter
and the integral constants in the unperturbed solution, which will move by the perturba-
tion. when x2  x1 >> , u0(x; x1, x2) in the neighborhood of x = x1 may be represented
by

u0(x; x1, x2) = u0(t; x1)(x) + s(x),

u0(t; x1)(x) = u(x  x1),

where  is a small parameter because the eect of the antikink u(x  x2)  1 is small
around x = x1; the order of  is exp((x2  x1)/). this implies that as the unperturbed
solution around x  x1, we may take u0(t; x1), where x1 is a constant. thus we are led
to represent the solution at t  t0 by

u(x, t) = u0(t; x1(t0))(x) + s(x) + v(x, t),

with v(x, t) as small as . inserting (6.4) into (6.1), we have

tv = av + (f(u0)  f(1))s + o(2 + |v|2),

with

av (cid:18)2 2

x2 + f(u0)(cid:19)v.

(6.4)

(6.5)

(6.6)

here, we have made use of the fact that u0 and s + 1 are stationary solutions to eq.(6.1);
we also note that f(1) = f(1).

(6.5) is an equation of the type discussed in 4.1. indeed, owing to the translational
invariance of the tdgl equation (6.1), the self-adjoint operator a has a zero eigenvalue
with the eigenfunction u1 together with the corresponding adjoint eigenfunction eu1

(6.7)

u1(x) = fu1(x) = xu(x  x1).

therefore, one can obtain the approximate solutions of (6.5) and the dynamics of x1(t)
according to the procedure developed in 4.1.

the solution of the eigenvalue problem for the operator a may be seen in text books
on quantum mechanics[47]. let p be the projection operator onto the kernel of a and q
the one onto the subspace compliment to the kernel a; we call the respective subspaces
p - and q-space. we notice that

p u =

< u1, u >
< u1, u1 >

u1(x),

where < u, v > denotes the inner product dened by

< u, v >=z 



u(x)v(x)dx.

41

(6.8)

(6.9)

now let us apply the rg method to solve v, thereby obtain the dynamics of x1(t).

first we expand v as

v = v1 + o(2).

(6.10)

the equations for v1 read

tv1 = av1 + (f(u0)  f(1))s.

in this case, w0(t0) in 4.1 is u(xx1(t0)). w1(t0) in q-space is given by (a)1q{f(u0)
f(1)}s by (4.16) and v1 is

v1(t; t0)(x) = (t  t0)p (f(u0)  f(1))s(x) + a1q(f(u0)  f(1))s(x).

(6.11)

thus, we have an approximate function

u(t; t0)(x) = u(x  x1(t0)) + v1(t; t0)(x).

applying the rg equation to u(t; t0)(x), one has

u

t0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t0=t

leading to the dynamics governing x1,

0 =

=  x1xu(x  x1)  p (f(u0)  f(1))s(x) + o(2),

x1 = 

= 

+ o(2)

< u1, u1 >

< u1, (f(u0)  f(1))s >
< xu(x  x1), (f(u(x  x1))  f(1)){u(x  x2)  1} >
< xu(x), (f(u(x))  f(1)){u(x  (x2  x1))  1} >

< u1, u1 >

+ o(2)

+ o(2)

= 
= 12e

< u1, u1 >

x2x1

 + o(2),

(6.12)

which coincides with the result by carr-pego[44], fuco-hale[46] and ei-ohta[45] where
an explicit evaluation of the inner products is also given.

6.1.2 kink-antikink interaction in the presence of innite kinks and antikinks

we next consider an initial value problem of eq.(6.1) with the initial condition where
innite kinks (antikinks) are located periodically at x = h + 2n (x = h + 2n) with
n = 0,1,2... [44, 46]: we suppose that the intervals of a kink and the neighboring
antikinks are much larger than the width of a kink (antikink), i.e., h  . in this situation,

42

the problem may be formulated as an inital value problem with one kink at x = h in a
nite domain 0 < x < 1 with a neumann boundary condition, i.e.,

=

u

x(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=0

.

u

x(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=1

(6.13)

the initial prole in this case can be approximately represented by the function

u0(x; h) = u(x  h) + {u(x + h  2)  1} + {u(x + h) + 1},

 u0(x) + 1r(x) + 2(x)

(6.14)
(6.15)

where the second and the third terms denote the small eects coming from the antikink
at x = 2  h and x = h, respectively; the smallness of the eects are represented by
the parameters 1 and 2, which are the orders of exp(2h/) and exp(2(1  h)/),
respectively.

let us represent the solution for t > 0 by

u(x, t) = u0(x; h) + v(x, t),

(6.16)

where |v(x, t)| is supposed to be as small as 1 and 2. inserting (6.16) into eq.(6.1), we
have

tv = av + (f(u0)  f(1))(1r + 2) + o(2

1 + 2

2 + |v|2)

(6.17)

in a similar manner with (6.5). here, av  (2 2
associated with zero eigenvalue in this case is u1 = xu(x  h).

x2 + f(u0))v and the eigenfunction

let us apply the rg method to solve v, thereby obtain the dynamics of h(t). first

we expand v as

v = 1v1,0 + 2v0,1 + o(2

1 + 2

2).

the equations for v1,0 and v0,1 read

tv1,0 = av1,0 + (f(u0)  f(1))r,
tv0,1 = av0,1 + (f(u0)  f(1)),

(6.18)

(6.19)
(6.20)

respectively. these are of the same form as treated in 4.1, hence readily soloved to be
(6.21)

v1,0(t; t0)(x) = (t  t0)p (f(u0)  f(1))r(x) + a1q(f(u0)  f(1))r(x),

by chosing the initial value

v1,0(t0; t0)(x) = a1q(f(u0)  f(1))r(x),

(6.22)

and v0,1(x, t) with r(x)  (x). thus, we have

u(t; t0)(x) = u(x  h(t0)) + 1v1,0(t; t0)(x) + 2v0,1(t; t0)(x).

43

applying the rg equation to u(t; t0)(x), one has

0 =

u

t0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t0=t

=  hu(x  h)  p (f(u0)  f(1))(1r(x) + 2(x))

+o(2

1 + 2

2),

leading to the dynamics governing h,

< u1, (f(u0)  f(1))(1r + 2) >

< u1, u1 >

+ o(2

1 + 2
2)

h = 
= 12(cid:18)e 2h

  e

2(1h)

 (cid:19) + o(2

1 + 2

2),

which also coincides with the known result by carr-pego[44] and fusco-hale[46].

6.2 soliton-soliton interaction in kdv equation

the kdv equation reads

which has a one-pulse solution given by

tu + 6uxu + 3

xu = 0,

u(x, t) =

sech2(cid:20)c(x  ct)

2

c
2

(cid:21) (x  ct; c),

with c being a velocity.

(6.23)

(6.24)

(6.25)

(6.26)

we consider the following problem; when two suciently separated pulses with almost

the same velocities are located at x1(0) and x2(0) where |x2(0) x1(0)|  1/c, how will

the locations xi(t) (i = 1, 2) change at t > 0? to solve this problem, ei and ohta [45]
started with the ansatz

u(x, t) = (x  ct  x1; c + x1) + (x  ct  x2; c + x2) + b(x  ct, t).

(6.27)

in the present work, we shall apply the rg method without any ansatz to this problem
and show that the same evolution equation as that obtained by ei and ohta is derived,
thereby give a foundation of their treatment.

to study the problem, it is convenient to change the independent variables to

t = t,

z = x  ct,

(6.28)

namely to change to the comoving frame with the pulse. then the equation is converted
to

tu + f [u] = 0,

44

(6.29)

with

we remark that

f [u] = czu + 6uzu + 3
z u.

f [(z  b; c)] = 0,

with b being an arbitrary constant.

let us suppose that the solution around t = t0 > 0 is given by

u(z, t) = (z  z1(t0); c) + (z  z2(t0); c) + v(z, t),

 (1) + (2) + v,

(6.30)

(6.31)

(6.32)
(6.33)

where |z2  z1| is suciently large. to study the eect coming from the other pulse, it is
sucient to consider the case of either z  z1 or z  z2. then v is considered to be small.

substituting eq.(6.32) into (6.29), we have the equation govering v as

tv + f [(1) + (2)]v + 6z((1)(2)) + o(|v|2) = 0.

(6.34)

here we have used the identity f [(1) + (2)] = f [(1) + (2)]  f [(1)]  f [(2)] =
6z((1)(2)) on account of eq.(6.31).

now let z  z1, then (2) is small and we may put

with a small parameter  whose order is ec(z2z1). then, (6.34) of v becomes

(2) = (z  z2(t0)) = g(z  z2(t0)),

tv = a(1)v  6z((1)g) + o(2 + |v|2),

where

a(1) = f [(1)] = cz  3

z  6(z(1) + (1)z).

transforming z  z1(t0) to z, we see (6.36) becomes

tv = av  6z (g(h)) + o(2 + |v|2),

where a = f () and g(h)(z) = (z  h) with h = z2(t0)  z1(t0).

(6.35)

(6.36)

(6.37)

(6.37) is an equation of the type discussed in 4.3; the linear operator a has a jordan
cell reecting the translational invariance of kdv equation and the arbitrariness of the
velocity of a pulse,

where

au1 = 0, au2 = u1,

u1 = z, u2 = c.

45

(6.38)

(6.39)

the adjoint operator a of a reads

a = cz  + 3

z  + 6z ,

(6.40)

which has also a two-dimensional jordan cell. the zero mode eu2 of a is found to be [45]
it is known [48] that there exists a function eu1 which satises

(6.41)

(6.42)

eu2(z) = (z; c).
aeu1 = eu2.

the explicit form of it will be given later.

let p be the projection operator onto the subspace spanned by u1 and u2, and q

onto the subspace compliment of the p -space.

noting that |v|  o() and expanding v as

one has for v1 from (6.37)

v = v1 + 2v2 +    ,

tv1 = av1  6z (g(h)).

(6.43)

(6.44)

now we can proceed according to the general procedure given in 4.3 as follows: note
that u0 and hence w0(t0) in 4.3 correspond to (z  z1(t0); c) because both of them
comes from the translation invariance with respect to z. let us solve the equation (6.44)
with the initial value w1(t0). then, we have

v1(t; t0) = e(tt0)aw1(t0)  6z t

t0

e(ts)az (g(h))ds,

(6.45)

with

w1(t0) = c(t0)u2 + qw1(t0)

(6.46)

as discussed in 4.3. here we note that although w1(t0) could have a u1 component, its
eect can be taken into account by a redenition of z1(t0) which is not yet determined.
according to the discussion given in 4.3, the q-component of w1 should be

qw1(t0) = a1q(6z (g(h))).

thus we have

v1(t; t0)(z) = (cid:26)(t  t0)c(t0) + (t  t0) +

(t  t0)2(cid:27) u1
+{c(t0) + (t  t0)}u2  a1q(6z (g(h)))

1
2

46

(6.47)

(6.48)

and the approximate function

u(t; t0)(z) = (z  z1(t0); c) + v1(t; t0)(z  z1(t0)),

where

 =

< eu1,6z (g(h)) >

< eu1, u1 >

,

 =

< eu2,6z (g(h)) >

< eu2, u2 >

.

applying the rg equation to u(t; t0)(z), one has

u

t0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t0=t

=  z1z(1) + h{c  }u (1)

1 + { c  }u (1)

2 i + o(2),

where u (1)
u (1)

is similarly given. since

where (h)(z) = (z  h), and putting c(t) = c1(t), we nally obtain the equations of
motion governing the position of the kink and the speed of it,

z1 = c1 +

< eu1,6z ((h)) >

< eu1, u1 >

,

c1 =

< eu2,6z ((h)) >

< eu2, u2 >

similarly, one can readily obtain the equation for z2. this is the main result in this
subsection.

eliminating c1 from the above equations, one can compare our result with those given

by ei and ohta[45]. we rst notice that

z1 =

(6.55)

and similarly

z2  16c5/2ec(z2z1),

(6.56)

which coincide with the result by ei and ohta[45]. in short, we have derived the equation
describing the soliton-soliton dynamics in the kdv equation given by ei and ohta with
fewer ansatz on the basis of the rg method.

as noticed above, the system (6.53) have more information for the soliton-soliton
dynamics than (6.55) (or (6.56)) because (6.53) gives the the change of the velocity c1
as well as the speed of the position z1. it is intriguing to see an explicit form of (6.53),
which will provide more detailed information of the dynamics of the solitons.

the right hand side of the equation for c1 in (6.53) is already given in (6.55). let us

calculate the r.h.s. of z1. the adjoint eigenfunction eu1 is given by

c(s; c)ds + ,

eu1 =z z



where  = m1/m2 with m1 = 1/2 (cid:18)z 
and m2 =< , c >[48]. m2 is
evaluated to be c/2[45]. we here evaluate m1. we rst notice that c = /c+zz/2c.
then by a partial derivative, we have

cds(cid:19)2



z z



cds =



hence m1 = 1/2c and

7 brief summary and concluding remarks

we have formulated the rg method as a powerful tool for reduction of evolution equa-
tions in terms of the notion of invariant manifolds, starting from the exact wilson rg
equation. we have given an argument as to why t0 should be set t = 0 in the perturba-
tive rg method. we have shown that the perturbative rg method constructs invariant
manifolds successively as the initial value of evolution equations; the integral constants
in the unperturbative solution constitutes natural coordinates of the invariant manifold
when the linear operator a in the evolution equation has no jordan cell. when a has
a jordan cell, there is a slight complication because the dimension of the invariant man-
ifold is to change by the perturbation. the rg equation determines the slow motion
of the integral constants in the unperturbative solution on the invariant manifold. we
have worked out several examples to demonstrate our formulation. we have emphasized
that the underlying structure of the reduction by the rg method completely ts to the
universal structure elucidated by kuramoto[16] a decade ago. the prescription suggested
by the present formulation has turned out to be the same as that adopted in [25, 26]. we
have applied the method to interface dynamics such as kink-anti-kink and soliton-soliton
interactions in the latter of which a linear operator having a jordan-cell structure appears.

in the present work, actual calculations are all based on the perturbation theory,
although we have started the formulation with the exact ow equation. recently, variants
of the exact rg equations or ow equations are applied to various problems such as the
chiral symmetry breaking in qcd[13], the bose-einstein condensation in alkali atoms
[58] and so on. there, in stead of the perturbation theory, a truncation of the functional
spaces are usually employed as a practical method of calculations. one may thus imagine
that a possible practical method for applying the non-perturbative rg method could be
a scheme similar to, say, the galerkin method[59]. such a non-perturbative rg method
should be most interesting for analyses of partial dierential equations. an attempt to
apply a kind of non-perturbative rg equation to partial dierential equations is given in
[60].

appendix a an ecient operator method of solution suitable

for the rg method

in this appendix, we shall summarize rules for obtaining appropriate special solutions
of non-homogeneous equations appearing in the higher orders in the perturbatve rg
method. the essential point of the present method is to consider the equations with
initial conditions at t = t0; the initial values are determined so that the terms in the
special solutions disappear which either could be renomarized away by a redinition
of the integral constants in the unperturbed solution or are the ones describing a rapid
motion. we show that the simple rules to write down the special solutions with such
initial conditions can be summarized as an operator method.

let us consider the special solution to the equation given by

with the initial condition at t = t0,

(t  a)u(t; t0) = f (t),

u(t0, t0) = w (t0).

the solution reads

u(t; t0) = ea(tt0)w (t0) + eatz t

t0

dseasf (s).

let a be a semi-simple matrix with eigenvalues  ( = 1, 2, ...);

the case where a has a jordan cell will be considered later.

au  = u .

let

(a.1)

(a.2)

(a.3)

(a.4)

f (t) = etu  + e tu  + etu ,

(a.5)

with  6= , then the solution is evaluated to be

u(t; t0) = ea(tt0)"w (t0) 
+(t  t0)etu  +

e tu  +

the rst line suggests that the initial value should be chosen as

w (t0) =

1

  a

e t0u  +

1

  a

et0u ,

51

(a.6)

(a.7)

where the rst term corresponds to the one which could be renormalized away by a
redeniton of the unperturbed solution and the second term to a rapid motion. thus we
end up with the special solution given by

u(t; t0) = (t  t0)etu  +

1

  a

e tu  +

next, we consider the case where a has a semi-simple zero eigenvalue;

let p and q be the projection operator onto the space spanned by u 0 and its orthogonal
compliment, respectively. if g is a constant vector, then one can easily verify that

au 0 = 0.

(a.27)

(a.28)

finally we consider the case where a has a two dimensional jordan cell;

the adjoint has also a jordan cell;

au 1 = 0, au 2 = u 1.

a u 1 = 0, a u 2 = u 1.

(a.24)
the adjoint operator a is dened by hv , aui = hav , ui, where hv , ui is the her-
mitian inner product. we dene the projection operators p and q onto the subspace
{u 1, u 2} and its orthogonal compliment, respectively. we suppose that the following
normalization condition is satised;

a vector u in the p-space is decomposed as u = h u 2, uiu 1 + h u 1, uiu 2.

h u 2, u 1i = 1,

h u 1, u 2i = 1.

let g be a constant vector, then one has,

thus, for example,

(n + 2)(n + 1)

53

(t  t0)(n+2)h u 1, giu 1.

the formulae involving qg are the same as those in the semi-simple case.

the extension to the case where a has a higher dimensional jordan cell is easy. for

instance, when a has a three-dimensional jordan cell such as

au 1 = 0, au 2 = u 1, au 3 = u 2,

(a.29)

one can easily verify that

dsz s

where the adjoints satisfy

a u 1 = 0, a u 2 = u 1, a u 3 = u 2.

the normalization condition reads h u 3, u 1i = h u 2, u 2i = h u 1, u 3i = 1.

54

appendix b the period of the lotka-volterra equation

the lotka-volterra equation admit periodic solutions. an approximate but globally
valid periodic solution was explicitly constructed by the rg method by one of the present
author.[26] the main purpose of this appendix is to show that the solution constructed
there gives the period which coincides with that obtained by frame[55] in a quite dierent
approach. to make the argument selfcontained, however, we shall repeat the rg analysis
but in a mathematically more simple way than that given in [26].

introducing the new variable u = t(, ) by

x = (b + )/,

y = a/ + ,

eq.(5.19) is reduced to the following one:

where

(cid:18) d
dt  l0(cid:19)u = (cid:18) 1
1(cid:19) ,
l0 =(cid:18) 0 b
0 (cid:19) .

u =(cid:18) 
(cid:19) ,

a

(b.1)

(b.2)

(b.3)

l0 has the eigenvalues  = iab  i, with the corresponding eigenvectors given by
u 1 = t(1,i/b) and u 2 = u 1, respectively. here a denotes the complex conjugate of
a. to make the following calculation as transparent as possible, we rst transform the
equation to the form where l0 is diagonalized. then one nds that the vector equation
(b.2) is reduced to a scalar equation

  d
dt  i! z = 

i

b

(z2  z2),

(b.4)

where  = 1/2  (1  ib/) and z(t) = 1/2  ( + ib/  ). this equation apparantly has a
much simpler form than that treated in [26].

now we try to solve (b.4) around t  t0 by the perturbation theory by expanding
z = z0 + z1 + 2z2 + o(2), with the initial condition z(t; t0) = w (t0). w (t0) is also
expanded as w (t0) = w0(t0) + w1(t0) + 2w2(t0) + o(2).

a simple manipulation gives the solution as follows;

z(t; t0) = c(t0)eit +

(b.6)

since |c(t)|2 = const. as easily veried from (b.6), one may put c = a

being a real constant. then (b.6) implies that  = 2a2/24b2  (1 + b2/2), hence
(t) = 2a2/24b2  (1 + b2/2)t + .

for a calculational convenience, let us dene  by (t) = t +  with

(b.7)

which implies that c(t)eit = a/2 (sin  i cos ). then we have nally the components

it is remarkable that we have obtained the modied angular velocity  depending on

that the period trg = 2/ coincides with that given by frame up to o(2).

it should be remarked here that c2 is actually a constant because our system has a
conserved quantity b ln x  x + a ln y  y = const. in fact, one can easily verify that

c2 =

note that  and  needed to calculate the r.h.s. of each other up to o(2). (b.15) are only
