abstract

we determine the exact quantum particle reection amplitudes for all known vacua
of a(1)
n ane toda theories on the half-line with integrable boundary conditions.
(real non-singular vacuum solutions are known for about half of all the classically
integrable boundary conditions.) to be able to do this we use the fact that the par-
ticles can be identied with the analytically continued breather solutions, and that
the real vacuum solutions are obtained by analytically continuing stationary soliton
solutions. we thus obtain the particle reection amplitudes from the corresponding
breather reection amplitudes. these in turn we calculate by bootstrapping from
soliton reection matrices which we obtained as solutions of the boundary yang-
baxter equation (reection equation).

we study the pole structure of the particle reection amplitudes and uncover an un-
expectedly rich spectrum of excited boundary states, created by particles binding to
the boundary. for a(1)
4 toda theories we calculate the reection amplitudes
for particle reection o all these excited boundary states. we are able to explain
all physical strip poles in these reection factors either in terms of boundary bound
states or a generalisation of the coleman-thun mechanism.

introduction and overview

the study of two-dimensional integrable quantum eld theories is interesting because it allows
one to calculate exactly things like the quantum behaviour of solitons, the weakstrong coupling
duality, the eects of space-time boundaries, etc. exact studies in two dimensions allow one to
speculate more condently about these phenomena also in higher dimensions. a particularly
rewarding class of integrable quantum eld theories to study are the ane toda eld theo-
ries (atfts). some of their nice features include: they exhibit weakstrong coupling duality,
they have quantum group symmetries [2], they have solitons and breathers [30, 33], and, most
importantly for this paper, they have a rich set of integrable boundary conditions [11, 3].

for the particles of real coupling ane toda theories without boundaries it has been possible
to nd the exact s-matrices, describing the evolution of arbitrary asymptotic incoming particle
states into asymptotic outgoing particle states [1, 5, 8, 15]. it has been a longstanding challenge
to extend these results to the half-line with integrable boundary conditions.

we will only deal with a(1)

n toda theory in this paper. the classical equation of motion for

the n-component bosonic eld of a(1)

n toda theory is

t   2
2

x +

m2


n

xi=0

iei = 0.

(1.1)

the i, i = 1,    , n are the simple roots of the lie algebra an = sln+1 and 0 is minus the
highest root. we will use units so that the mass scale m = 1. note that the coupling constant 
could be removed from the equations of motion by rescaling the eld and therefore the coupling
constant plays a role only in the quantum theory.

it has been discovered in [11, 3] that this equation of motion can be restricted to the left
half-line x < 0 without losing integrability if one imposes a boundary condition at x = 0 of the
form

where the boundary parameters ci satisfy either

 x +

n

xi=0

ci iei/2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=0

= 0,

which gives the neumann boundary condition, or

ci = 0 ,

(i = 0, 1, . . . , n) ,

ci = 1 ,

(i = 0, 1, . . . , n) ,

(1.2)

(1.3)

(1.4)

which will be denoted as the (++... ...) boundary conditions.

the original ideas needed to determine the full s-matrix in the presence of integrable
boundary conditions are due to cherednik [7], ghoshal and zamolodchikov[28] and fring and
koberle[21]. as a consequence of the higher-spin symmetries of ane toda theory all ampli-
tudes factorise into products of the two-particle scattering amplitudes and the single-particle

1

reection amplitudes. these amplitudes in turn are strongly restricted by the requirements
of real analyticity, unitarity, crossing symmetry and the bootstrap equations. we recall some
details regarding this in section 2.

if one knows the spectrum of the integrable theory under investigation, these constraints are
usually strong enough to determine the amplitudes uniquely. this explains the success in nding
the s-matrices for ane toda theories on the whole line, because one can read o the particle
spectrum directly from the lagrangian. in a theory on the half-line however a large number of
boundary bound states can exist in addition to the particle states. unfortunately there is no
obvious way how to read o the spectrum of boundary states directly from the lagrangian. this
is the reason why many previous attempts to determine the reection amplitudes relying only
on the above mentioned constraints have failedc. we will see below that the correct reection
factors have a rather intricate boundary state spectrum.

the new approach to nding the particle reection amplitudes which we will use in this paper
has been proposed in [26]. it is based on an earlier discovery that the lowest breather states in
imaginary coupling toda theory can be identied with the fundamental particles in the real cou-
pling theory in the sense that the particle s-matrices are obtained from the breather s-matrices
by analytic continuation in the coupling constant [23, 24]. previously this phenomenon was
only known to be exhibited by the sine-gordon model. in [26] it was proposed that the same
should also hold for the reection amplitudes. analytic continuation of the breather reection
amplitudes should give the particle reection amplitudes.

in [26] the reection equation for a(1)

the breather reection amplitudes are determined by bootstrap from the reection ampli-
tudes of the constituent solitons. the soliton reection amplitudes in turn can be obtained by
solving the reection equation which is the analogue of the yang-baxter equation for reection
amplitudes.
2 toda theory was solved and the particle
reection amplitudes for a(1)
2 toda theory with neumann or (+ + +) boundary condition were
calculated. the results are briey recalled and then generalised to a(1)
n toda theory with arbi-
trary n in section 3. we obtain the reection amplitudes for the uniform (+ +    + +) boundary
condition in eq.(3.16) and nd that they conrm an early conjecture made in [11]. the reec-
tion amplitudes for the neumann boundary condition, which we conjecture to be obtained by
duality, are given in eq.(3.20).

a prerequisite for progress towards deriving the reection amplitudes for the other integrable
boundary conditions was an understanding of their classical vacuum solutions. bowcock [4]
determined these vacuum solutions for a(1)
n toda theories. this study of classical solutions was
simplied and generalised in [16]. it was found that for about half of all integrable boundary
conditions in a(1)
n toda theory real-valued vacuum solutions can be obtained by analytically
continuing a solution describing a stationary soliton in front of the boundary. we therefore call
these boundary conditions solitonic. some details of this are given in section 4. with this
knowledge it is then easy to obtain the particle reection amplitudes for the vacuum states for
these boundary conditions. this is done in section 5. we nd that the boundary conditions fall

csee however [11, 12] in which conjectures were based on calculations of boundary solutions. some of these

conjectures we will conrm to be correct.

into (n + 1)/2 equivalence classes (where k is the integer part of k). namely all boundary
conditions whose vacuum solutions are obtained from solitons in the same multiplet or from
solitons in the conjugate multiplet give rise to the same reection amplitudes. the result for
the reection amplitudes can be found in eqs. (5.5), (5.4).

in section 6 we study the pole structure of these reection amplitudes. this constitutes
most of the work in this paper. we discover that the vacuum reection factors have simple
poles which imply the existence of excited boundary states. we can obtain the amplitudes for
reection o these excited boundaries by using the boundary bootstrap equations. these in
turn have new poles implying the existence of yet more excited boundary states.

2 and a(1)

we have performed this analysis in detail for the cases of the a(1)

4 toda theories. in
each of these cases we end up with an array of boundary states. the number of excited boundary
states grows as the coupling constant becomes smaller. as an example we have plotted in gures
1 and 2 the spectrum of boundary states for the solitonic boundary conditions of a(1)
2 ane toda
theory at two dierent values of the coupling constant b = 2
4 ). in gure 1 we have also
indicated which particle has to bind to the boundary to go from one state to the other by labels
on the lines connecting the states. a more illuminating animated plot of the spectrum can be
found on this papers web site at http//www.mth.kcl.ac.uk/~delius/pub/reflection.html.
the amplitudes for the reection of the particles o these boundary states are given explicitly

in section

in eq.(6.7) for a(1)
eqs. (6.28) and (6.29) for the second class. we have also begun the analysis for a(1)
3
6.3.

2 /(1 + 2

in these reection amplitudes there are also a large number of physical strip poles which do
not correspond to new bound states but have an explanation in terms of a boundary generalisa-
tion [20] of the coleman-thun mechanism [9]. the way in which this works conveys the strong
impression that there is some magic at work which awaits a deeper explanation.

2 exact s-matrices and reection amplitudes

this section gives a brief review of the properties of particle s-matrices and reection amplitudes
and the consistency equations which they are subject to. for an excellent presentation of this
material see [13].

the reason why the full s-matrices of ane toda theories can be determined exactly is that
these theories possess higher-spin symmetries. a higher-spin symmetry implies that the sum of
some power of the momenta of the particles is conserved during scattering. this allows only
processes in which the incoming particles have the same momenta as the outgoing ones. fur-
thermore a higher-spin symmetry acts on the particles by shifting them by amounts proportional
to powers of their momenta. this allows one to separate the interaction regions as illustrated
in gure 3. this implies that any s-matrix factorizes into a product of 2-particle s-matrices.

if the particles live on a half-line, then in addition to scattering with each other they are
also going to reect o the boundary. ideally one would hope that a multi-particle process will
now factorise into a succession of two-particle scatterings and single-particle reections o the
boundary, as depicted in gure 4. of course all momentum-dependent translation symmetries

figure 4: in the presence of an integrable boundary any multi-particle process factorises into a
product of two-particle scatterings and single-particle reections.

in the space direction will be broken by the boundary. however one can choose the boundary
condition in such a way that it preserves those parts of the higher-spin-symmetries which eect
momentum-dependent translations in the time direction and these suce to separate the inter-
action regions. thus in order to determine the full s-matrix on the half-line we only need the
single-particle reection matrices and the two-particle s-matrices. the later will not be changed
by the presence of the boundary because the particle scatterings could be shifted arbitrarily far
away from the boundary.

in ane toda theory all particles are distinguished by their masses and higher-spin charges

and therefore the s-matrix has to be diagonal.

the scattering and the reection amplitudes have to be unitary, real analytic and 2i-

as an illustration we give the scattering amplitudes for a(1)

by going from the mandelstamm variable s to the relative rapidity variable  the physical
sheet has been mapped to the physical strip 0 < im() <  (see for example [37] for details).
every pole on the physical strip has to have a physical explanation. in the example above the
amplitude s11 has a pole from the block (2) at  = 2i/3 which corresponds to the propagation
of a particle of type 2 in the forward channel, as depicted in gure 5 a).

a further consequence of the higher-spin symmetries and the corresponding momentum-
dependent translation of particle lines is the bootstrap principle.
it expresses the scattering
amplitudes for bound states in terms of those of the constituent particles. for example the
bound state pole discussed above leads to the following bootstrap equation which gives s12 in
terms of s11,

this provides an independent consistency check on the amplitude s12 given in (2.7) which was
already determined by crossing symmetry. in practice there is a large number of such bootstrap
consistency equations and these, together with the requirement that any pole on the physical
strip needs to have a physical explanation, are strong enough to determine the s-matrices of all
ane toda theories uniquely.

similar relations exist for the reection amplitudes. firstly there is a bootstrap equation
relating the reection amplitudes of the dierent particles to each other, depicted in gure 7.
secondly every pole on the physical strip requires a physical explanation. for reection ampli-
tudes the physical strip in the rapidity plane is bounded by im()  /2. our example in (2.9)
has two simple poles on the physical strip, namely at  = i 
these correspond to the propagation of excited boundary states as illustrated in gure 5 b). the
reection amplitudes for reection of these excited boundaries is determined by the following

the bootstrap equations would probably again be strong enough to determine the reection
amplitudes uniquely if one knew the spectrum of excited boundary states a priori. however this
is not easy to derive directly and therefore we took a dierent route, to be described below.

not only tree diagrams as those in gure 5 give rise to poles on the physical strip. rather
any feynman diagram in which some internal lines are on-shell can produce poles. for example
the box diagram in gure 6a) will lead to a second order pole if all the internal lines can be
simultaneously on shell (which does not happen in a(1)
2 but in higher toda theories). the
order of the pole is determined by the number of lines on shell minus twice the number of loop
integrations. the boundary diagram in gure 6(b) has six internal lines and two loop momenta
and will thus generically lead to a second order pole unless the reection amplitude in the middle
of the diagram does itself have poles or zeros at this point. this boundary generalisation of the
coleman-thun mechanism [9] was discovered by dorey et.al. in [20].

thus to check a conjectured amplitude one should draw all possible diagrams which can
have internal lines on shell, determine what kind of poles they lead to, and then compare with
the pole structure of the conjectured amplitude. these checks have been carefully performed
for the scattering amplitudes of ane toda theory on the whole line. we will do the same for
our reection amplitudes for a(1)
4 toda theory in section 6 and will nd that it works
quite miraculously. a similar analysis has been performed for the reection amplitudes in the
boundary scaling lee-yang model [20].

3 reection amplitudes for neumann and (+ +    + +) boundary

conditions

3.1 reection in a(1)

2 atft revisited

in a recent paper [26] one of us constructed reection amplitudes for a(1)
recall the main results of this work here.

2 atft. we briey

the construction was based on new solutions to the a(1)

2 boundary yang-baxter equation
(bybe). some of these new solutions, the so-called k-matrices, were conjectured to describe
the reection of the fundamental solitons in imaginary coupling a(1)
2 atft. by comparison
with semi-classical calculations [16] it was possible to identify the two reection matrices which
correspond to the neumann and the uniform (+++) boundary conditions. using the boundary
bootstrap equations, the reection amplitudes for the breathers in the theory were constructed.
due to the identication of the lowest breathers in the imaginary coupling theory with the
fundamental particles in the real coupling theory, it was then possible to nd the reection
amplitudes for the particles in the real coupling a(1)
2 atft via a simple analytic continuation.
this led to the following particle reection amplitudes, corresponding to the neumann and

the uniform (+++) boundary conditions respectively,

in which the brackets are dened as in (2.4) with h = 3. these amplitudes are in agreement
with classical and semi-classical calculations [12, 31, 34].

given that the s-matrices in the bulk theory have long been known to be self-dual under a
weakstrong coupling duality, it was widely expected that a duality like that can also be found
in atft on a half-line. however, the above reection amplitudes are not self-dual, but instead
are dual to each other, i.e.

k n

1 ()  k1() ,

(as  

4


) .

(3.3)

this generalises the analogous result in the sinh-gordon theory in [14].

in the following we demonstrate how these results can be generalised to the case of a(1)
n
atfts. just as in the a(1)
case, our construction of particle reection amplitudes begins with
2
proposing a reection matrix for the fundamental solitons in imaginary coupling atft with
uniform (+ +    + +) boundary condition.

3.2 notation

we use the notation of [24]. whenever we deal with solitons or breathers, we use the following
parametrisation of the rapidity:

 = i

h
2

 ,

and the bracket notation

(cid:18)a(cid:19)i



[a]
[a]

,

[a]  sin(cid:16) 

h

(3.4)

in which h = n + 1 is the coxeter number of the ane lie algebra a(1)
imaginary toda coupling constant  in the following way:

n , and  is related to the

 = 

4
2  1 .

(3.5)

this is related to the function b() in eq.(2.8) which is used in real coupling toda theory by
 = 2/b. we introduced the subscript i in order to distinguish this block notation from the
block notation of eq.(2.4) which we use when dealing with the fundamental particles.

soliton reection matrices

3.3 the diagonal a(1)
n
although new non-diagonal solutions to the a(1)
n bybe have been found recently [27], it will
turn out that here we only need the diagonal solutions. in these k-matrices all non-diagonal
entries are zero, which signicantly simplies all other equations, like the bootstrap, crossing
and unitarity conditions.

we know from the classical calculations in [16] that solitons are always reected into an-
tisolitons by the boundaries which we are consideringd. we are therefore only interested in
those solutions of the bybe in which the solitons change into antisolitons, which means the
k-matrices are maps:

ka(a)() : va  vn+1a ,

(a = 1, 2, ..., n) .

(3.6)

it is fairly straightforward to show that there is a solution to the a(1)

n bybe of the form

ka(1)() =

1 0 . . .
0 1
...

a1() ,

dalso a soliton-preserving boundary conditions exists [17] but we do not consider it here.

10

which is a n  n square matrix, which maps the solitons in the rst multiplet into their charge
conjugate partners in the nth multiplet. a1() is an overall scalar factor, which is determined
by the requirements of boundary unitarity and boundary crossing.

similarly as in the a(1)
2

case from [26] the two conditions of boundary unitarity and boundary

crossing lead to the following equations for a1():

a1() a1() = 1 ,

a1( + n+1
a1( + n+1

=

a1( + n+1

(3.8)

in which a1 = an is the overall scalar factor of the charge conjugate reection matrix, and
f1,1() is the scalar factor of the a(1)
n s-matrix which was given in [24]. we can solve these
equations in the same way as it was done in [26], and we obtain the minimal solution

there is the freedom to add certain cdd factors to this solution as described in subsection 3.5.
we have checked that these soliton reection amplitudes agree semiclassically with the soliton
time-delays calculated in [16] for the uniform (+ +    + +) boundary condition.

in principle it would now be possible to obtain the other soliton k-matrices ka(a)() for
(a = 1, . . . , n) by using the bootstrap equations. however, since we are mainly interested in the
reection amplitudes for the breathers and subsequently for the particles in the real coupling
theory, we can rst construct the reection amplitudes for the particle of type 1 and then use
the bootstrap equations directly in the real coupling theory.

3.4 the breather and particle reection amplitudes

the scattering amplitude for two solitons of type 1 and type n (= 1) has a pole at  = n+1
2   1
corresponding to the formation of the lowest breather state b(1)
1 . this leads to the breather
bootstrap equations which were described in great detail in the appendix of [26]e. without
going into further detail we can write down the result for the breather reection amplitude,

efor the sine-gordon model the breather reection amplitudes were obtained by ghoshal in [29].

11

the fact that solitons reect into antisolitons in the charge conjugate multiplet ensures that the
breather reection is purely diagonal.

since the breather b(1)

n atft, we
obtain the reection amplitude for this particle through analytic continuation   i in (3.11).
we nd

1 () corresponds to the rst particle in real coupling a(1)

b

2(cid:19) ,

(3.12)

in which we now use the block notation (2.4) and the parameter b = 2/. in analogy to the
construction of the exact s-matrices [5], it is possible to construct the reection amplitudes for
all other particles from this lowest reection amplitude. in a(1)
n atft two particles, say a and
b, can fuse into a particle a + b at the rapidity dierence  = i a+b
n+1 (if a + b < n + 1). the
bootstrap principle for an integrable theory on the half-line states that the reection of two
particles is independent of whether the fusion into a third particle occurs before or after they
reect o the boundary. this leads to the following boundary bootstrap equation [21] which is
illustrated in gure 7:

ka+b() = kb(cid:18)  i

a

n + 1(cid:19) sa,b(cid:18)2 + i

b  a

n + 1(cid:19) ka(cid:18) + i

b

n + 1(cid:19) ,

(3.13)

in which sa,b() is the real coupling a(1)

n ane toda s-matrix, which can be written in the form

sa,b() =

a+b1

yab+1

step 2

(cid:18)p + 1(cid:19)(cid:18)p  1(cid:19)(cid:18)p  1 + b(cid:19)(cid:18)p + 1  b(cid:19) .

(3.14)

we have chosen a  b. we can now obtain any ka() from k1() by applying (3.13) successively

a  1 times:

ka() = k1(cid:18) + i

a  1

n + 1(cid:19) a1
yc=1

k1(cid:18)  i

a + 1  2c

n + 1 (cid:19) sac,1(cid:18)2 + i

3c  a  1

n + 1 (cid:19) .

(3.15)

using the formula (3.14) for the s-matrix we can compute the right hand side of (3.15) explicitly,
and we obtain

ka() =

a

yc=1(cid:18)c  1(cid:19)(cid:18)c  n  1(cid:19)(cid:18)c +

b

2(cid:19)(cid:18)c  n 

b

2(cid:19) .

(3.16)

it is interesting to note that this result agrees with a conjecture which was made for these reec-
tion amplitudes already 5 years ago in [11]. it is easy to check that these reection amplitudes
satisfy the necessary boundary crossing relation

ka()ka( + i) = saa(2).

figure 7: the boundary bootstrap relation

we also nd that the amplitudes are invariant under charge-conjugation,

the classical limit (b  0) of ka() is

ka() = ka() .

ka()  (cid:18)a(cid:19)(cid:18)a + n + 1(cid:19) .

(3.18)

(3.19)

this agrees with the classical result in formula (4.22) of [4].

in the sinegordon theory [14] as well as the a(1)

2 atft [26] it was found that the posi-
tive boundary condition and the neumann boundary condition are dual to each other under
the weakstrong coupling duality   4
 . therefore, we conjecture that the dual reec-
tion amplitude to (3.16) describes the reection of a(1)
n ane toda particles from a boundary
with neumann boundary condition. the dual of (3.16) can simply be obtained by changing
b  2  b,

b

2(cid:19)(cid:18)c + n + 1 +

b

2(cid:19) .

first we check the classical limit of these amplitudes and we nd

k n ()  1 ,

(b  0) ,

(3.20)

(3.21)

which supports the conjecture that k n
a () are the reection amplitudes for the neumann bound-
ary condition. in fact, here we can go one step further since kim [31] has computed the reection
amplitudes for the neumann boundary condition up to rst order in the coupling constant. if
we expand k n () in terms of 2 and compare the o(2) term with the perturbative result of
[31] we nd that they are indeed identical.

3.5 cdd pole ambiguities

the scalar factor in the soliton reection matrix is not uniquely xed by the equations (3.8).
rather the minimal solution given in eq.(3.9) can be multiplied by any factor () which satises

()() = 1 ,

( +

n + 1

4

) = ( +

n + 1

4

) .

(3.22)

such ambiguities are often referred to as cdd pole ambiguities. in order for the soliton bootstrap
equations to be satised the factors must obey the additional condition

() =

n

yk=1

(cid:18) +

n + 1

2

  k(cid:19) .

these equations are solved by the following expressions

c() = (cid:18) c

2

(cid:19)i(cid:18) n + 1

2

 

c
2

(cid:19)i

,

(3.23)

(3.24)

for c = 1, 2,     n+1
2

(actually c can run from 1 to n but that does not give any new factors

since c() = n+1c().) the inverse of this, i.e. (c())1 = (cid:18) c

2   n+1
a solution of eq.(3.23). the possible cdd factors are products of any of these blocks.

2(cid:19)(cid:18) c

2 (cid:19), is also

after the bootstrap to the breather reection amplitude and analytic continuation to the

particle amplitude a soliton cdd factor c() would lead to a particle cdd factor

kc() =(cid:18) n + 1

2(cid:19) .

(3.25)

the classical limit (b  0) of these factors is equal to 1.

we suspect that it will be impossible to nd a physical explanation of the extra poles supplied
by these cdd factors. therefore we will from now on work with the solution without cdd
factors for which we will show the consistency of the pole structure in section 6.

4 the vacuum solutions for the solitonic boundary conditions

we will now discuss the vacuum solutions to real coupling a(1)
half-line with boundary condition of the form (1.2),

n ane toda theory on the left

 x +

n

xi=0

ci iei /2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=0

14

= 0

(4.1)

two of these boundary conditions are rather special because their vacuum solution is simply
the constant solution  = 0. the simplest is the neumann condition which is obtained if all
the boundary parameters ci are equal to zero. the other is the boundary condition which has
all ci equal to +1. we will refer to it as the uniform (+ +    + +) boundary condition. the
boundary condition which has all ci equal to 1 is also satised by the constant solution  = 0
but for this boundary condition there exists another real solution with the same energy.

in [16] we explained that if the ci are equal to 1 with at least one being 1 and if they

satisfy the constraint

ci = 1,

n

yi=0

(4.2)

then the vacuum solution is obtained by taking a solution describing a stationary soliton on
the left half-line and continuing it to real . the soliton has to have a topological charge 
determined by

(1)i = ci,

i = 1, . . . , n.

(4.3)

we will refer to these boundary conditions as the solitonic boundary conditions.

for details of how we put a stationary soliton in front of the boundary we refer to [16]. it
turns out that a soliton with topological charge  gives the same vacuum solution as a soliton
with topological charge , which is good because both  and  give the same boundary
condition if substituted into eq.(4.3). in this section we will explain how to nd this topological
charge  given the boundary parameters ci.

it is known that the topological charges of the single soliton solutions all lie in fundamental
representations of an. a fundamental representation i is the representation whose highest
weight is the fundamental weight i. the fundamental weights i are dened by their property

i  j = ij,

i, j = 1, . . . , n.

any  can be written as a linear combination of the fundamental weights,  = pn

i=1 aii.
it is clear that eq.(4.3) implies that the coecient ai is even if ci = 1 and it is odd if ci = 1.
we will show below that the unique positive weight  which satises eq.(4.3) and which lies in a
fundamental representation is obtained by setting all the even ai to zero and letting the odd ai
alternate between +1 and 1 (with the highest non-vanishing coecient being +1 so that the
weight is positive). furthermore one can determine the particular fundamental representation
a in which the weight  lies by adding the indices of the fundamental weights multiplied by
their coecient in the expansion of . we illustrate this rule by a few examples:

c = (1, 1)
c = (1, 1, 1, 1)
c = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

 = 2  1  i
 = 4  2  i
 = 5  2 + 1  i

with i = 2  1 = 1,
with i = 4  2 = 2,
with i = 5  2 + 1 = 4,

(4.4)
(4.5)
(4.6)

where c = (c1, c2, . . . , cn). c0 is not needed because it is determined in terms of the other

cis by the condition in (4.2), namely c0 =qn

i=1 ci.

15

let us summarise the above rule for the relation between the boundary parameters ci and

the topological charge  of the soliton in a theorem.

theorem 4.1. let ci be the parameters specifying a solitonic boundary. let p = {k1, k2, . . . , ka}
be the ordered set of indices (with k1 < k2 <    < ka) for which the boundary parameters are
1, i.e., ck = 1 for k  p . if p is not empty then there is a unique positive weight  which
satises

and lies in a fundamental representation. it is given by

(1)i = ci,

i = 1, . . . , n,

and lies in the i-th fundamental representation where

a

 =

(1)aj kj ,

xj=1

i =

a

xj=1

(1)ajkj.

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

the rest of this section is devoted to the proof of this theorem and can be skipped. we

needed one elementary fact from the representation theory of simple complex lie algebras:

theorem 4.2. if  is a weight of some irreducible representation then   i is also a weight
of the representation i   i > 0. all weights of the representation are obtained from the
highest weight by repeatedly subtracting simple roots in all possible ways according to this rule.

we will use this to construct the weights of the fundamental representations of an.

it is
convenient to introduce an n + 1 dimensional euclidean space with orthonormal basis vectors
ei, i = 1, . . . , n + 1. we embed the n dimensional root space of an into this space such that it is
i=1 ei. an overcomplete and non-orthonormal

the hyperplane perpendicular to the vector e =pn+1

(but nevertheless useful) basis for the root space is given by the n + 1 vectors

i = ei 

1

n + 1

e,

i = 1,    , n + 1.

(4.10)

it is overcomplete because n+1 = pn

i=1 i. the simple roots can be chosen to be

i = ei  ei+1 = i  i+1,

i = 1, . . . , n.

(4.11)

the corresponding fundamental weights are

i =

i

xa=1

a,

i = 1, . . . , n.

(4.12)

we can now give the expressions for all the weights in the fundamental representations.

16

proposition 4.3. the weights of the i-th fundamental representation i are all vectors that are
given as a sum of i dierent basis vectors,

kj 6= kj  for j 6= j ) .

(4.13)

i =( i
xj=1

kj(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

in other words, the weight vectors of i are all vectors with i 1s and n  i 0s when expanded in
the  basis. they are positive if the n + 1st entry is 0. the dimension of the i-th fundamental
representation is

dim i =(cid:18)n + 1
i (cid:19) .

(4.14)

proof. consider any weight vector  whose entries are only 1s and 0s. the scalar product of
such a vector with a simple root j is positive only if the vector has a 1 at the j-th position and a
0 at the j + 1-st position. then and only then will   j also be a weight, according to theorem
4.2. the eect of subtracting j from  will be to shift the 1 at the j-th position one step to the
right. doing this repeatedly one can transform the highest weight vector i = (1, . . . , 1, 0, . . . , 0),
which has all the i 1s to the left and the 0s to the right, into any other vector with i 1s.
furthermore one will never obtain a weight vector with more or less than i 1s. the number of
dierent vectors with i 1s and the rest 0s is equal to the number of ways one can choose i sites
out of n + 1 and this gives the dimension of the i-th fundamental representation.

if one inverts the expressions (4.12) for the fundamental weights one arrives at the following

expressions for the basis vectors in terms of the fundamental weights

1 = 1,

i = i  i1,

i = 2, . . . , n,

n+1 = n.

(4.15)

substituting these in the above proposition one obtains the following corollary.

corollary 4.4. the positive weights in the i-th fundamental representation are linear combina-
k=1 akk, with the following restrictions on the coecients:

tions of fundamental weights,  =pn

1. the coecient of the largest occurring fundamental weight is 1, the coecient of the next
largest occurring fundamental weight is 1 and so on, the non-zero coecients alternating
between +1 and 1.

2. the coecients multiplied by the indices of the corresponding fundamental weights sum up

to i,

k ak = i.

n

xk=1

17

(4.16)

we are now in a position to prove our main theorem 4.1. the fact that a weight  given by
eq.(4.8) lies in the i-th fundamental representation with i given by eq.(4.9) is simply a rewriting
of corollary 4.4. it is obvious from i  j = ij that this  satises eq.(4.7). to prove that 
is the unique positive weight in a fundamental representation satisfying eq.(4.7) we only have
to observe that the total number of weights in the fundamental representations is

dimi =

n

xi=1

n

xi=1 (cid:18)n + 1

i (cid:19) = 2n+1  2

(4.17)

and thus the number of positive weights is equal to 2n  1 which is also equal to the number of
boundary conditions which satisfy eq.(4.2) and dont have all ci equal to 1.

5 the reection amplitudes for the solitonic boundary conditions

we can now utilise the result from the preceding section in order to construct the reection
amplitudes for the solitonic boundary conditions. we have seen that we should be able to
obtain them by putting a stationary soliton in front of the boundary. in the case of an incoming
breather this leads to an additional breathersoliton scattering process before and after the
reection o the boundary as illustrated in gure 8. the new reection amplitude is then
just the product of the two s-matrix elements and the reection amplitude for the uniform
(+ +    + +) boundary.

we thus obtain the following reection amplitudes for the particles in a(1)
boundary conditions:

n atft with solitonic

k (b)

a () = ka() m (b)

a () ,

in which ka() is given by (3.16). because of the symmetry relation (5.2) we nd that

(5.6)

this is needed for consistency because if a soliton of weight  lies in representation b then its
antisoliton of weight  lies in the conjugate representation n + 1  b and as we had mentioned
in section 4, both of these solitons give rise to the same vacuum solution and should therefore
also give the same particle reection factors.

something that wasnt obvious from the classical calculations is the fact that all solitonic
boundary conditions corresponding to topological charges  in the same fundamental represen-

tation vb or its dual vn+1b lead to the same reection amplitudes. there are only(cid:4) n+1

of boundary conditions, each corresponding to a pair of conjugate representations. the classical

2 (cid:5) classes

19

vacuum solutions look quite dierent for dierent members of these classes but their quantum
reection amplitudes turn out to be the same.

it is again easy to check that the above reection amplitudes (5.5) satisfy the necessary
boundary crossing and unitarity conditions. we can also look at the classical limit of these
amplitudes and we nd

6 poles and boundary bound states

in order to show the consistency of all reection amplitudes we have constructed, we need to
examine their pole structure and show that all physical strip poles can be explained in terms of
boundary bound states or in terms of some other processes which can be regarded as analogues
of the generalised coleman-thun mechanism in the bulk theory [20].

6.1 fixed poles

all a(1)
n ane toda particle reection amplitudes, as given in (3.16, 3.20, 5.5), contain the same
coupling constant independent part and we can therefore discuss the pole structure in this part
collectively for all boundary conditions. because ka = kn+1a we only need to consider the case
a  n+1
2 . once we have found the diagrams which explain the poles in ka, the poles in kn+1a
are explained by the charge conjugated versions of the same diagrams (i.e., we simply have to

replace every particle in a diagram by its antiparticle). the term qa

contains poles on the physical strip at

c=1(cid:18)c  1(cid:19)(cid:18)c  n  1(cid:19)

 = i

p

n + 1

,

p = 1, 2, . . . , a  1 .

(6.1)

the location of these poles does not depend on the coupling constant. they arise from the
triangle diagram depicted in gure 9 in which all lines are on-shell. it is clear that this reection
process only exists for p = 1, 2, . . . a  1 because otherwise particle a  p does not exist.

the angles in the diagram are not drawn to scale. they are determined by the requirement
that the internal particle lines should be on shell. the angles between the particle lines and

n+1p in the reection amplitude

the vertical are equal to i times the rapidity of the particles. thus, for example, to determine
the angle between the lines of particles p and a  p we only need to know the relative rapidity
at which particles p and a  p will fuse to form the particle a. this is  = i
n+1a, as can be
read o from either the masses of the particles or from the location of the corresponding pole
in the s-matrix element sp,ap. the angle is therefore equal to 
n+1a. this is also the angle
between the line of particle p and the boundary. in diagram 9, as in all diagrams which follow,
we have indicated the angle at which a particle line meets the boundary by giving a number

n+1. similarly, we give the angle of the
in parentheses which states the angle as a multiple of
incoming line in the lower left hand of the diagram. this gives the location of the pole produced
by the diagram.

diagram 9 contains three internal lines and one loop and will therefore lead to a simple pole
in the reection amplitude for particle a, provided that the reection of particle p does not
take place at a rapidity at which kp() displays a pole or a zero. the rapidity of particle p is
 = i
n+1a, as can be read o from the angle given. because p < a, kp does not have any pole or
zero at this location and therefore the diagram does indeed lead to a simple pole.

this diagram explains all  independent poles in all a(1)

n reection amplitudes. in the neu-
mann as well as the (++...+) boundary reection amplitudes there are no further poles. how-
ever, for the reection amplitudes (5.5) for the solitonic boundaries there are coupling constant
dependent poles. below we will study the pole structure in detail for a(1)
4 toda theo-
ries. we will restrict our attention to a coupling constant in the range 0 < b < 1 (recall that
in general 0  b  2) and we will exclude any non-generic rational values at which special
cancellations might take place.

we have labelled the vacuum state by b0,0 to distinguish it from the excited boundary states
bn,m to be derived below. in [11] a calculation of the classical reection amplitude had lead to
an expression for this reection amplitude containing an unknown function c of the coupling
constant. the conjecture coincides with our result if one sets c =  b
2 .

k1 contains no poles in the physical strip. so there are two physical strip poles in (6.3),

namely at

l =

(6.5)

where h only exists in the physical strip if b  1. we restrict our analysis to this case.

let us begin with the pole h in k b0,0

, which we expect to correspond to a boundary bound
state (or excited boundary). the reection amplitudes for the reection from this boundary
bound state can easily be computed using the boundary bootstrap equation eq.(2.13). the
boundary bound state formed by an incoming particle 1 with rapidity h will be denoted by b1,0.
the reection amplitude for particle 1 scattering o boundary b1,0 is

we nd that this reection amplitude again contains physical strip poles, some of which corre-
spond to new boundary bound states. through repeated application of the boundary bootstrap
equation and by considering all possible physical strip poles, we eventually obtain a whole array
of boundary bound states, which can be labelled by bn,m, in which n (m) is the number of
particles of type 1 (2) bound to the boundary. in addition it turns out that n or m can be

22

negative, but only as long as n + m  0. this ensures that there are no boundary states with
energies lower than the ground state b0,0.

puted and we nd

it is easy to check that these reection amplitudes all satisfy the necessary boundary unitarity,
crossing and bootstrap conditions. the blocks in (6.7) have been arranged such that the second
block in each line is the crossing transform of the rst block in this line, i.e. each line is of the

form (cid:18)a(n, m)(cid:19)(cid:18)h  a(m, n)(cid:19). the reection amplitudes for particle 2 can be obtained by

charge conjugation

(6.8)

in order to test the consistency of these reection amplitudes, we now have to explain all the
poles in these new reection amplitudes. to do this we will need to know the possible particle
fusings for a(1)
2 . they are 1 + 1  2 and 2 + 2  1, both occurring at a relative rapidity of
 = 2 i
3 .

first let us consider the case of n + m > 0. there are physical strip poles in the rst blocks
on the rst and second line and in the second block on the third line of eq.(6.7), which can be
explained by the diagrams in gure 10. note that diagram 10(c) only exists if m > 0. this
agrees with the fact that the corresponding pole in the amplitude moves o the physical strip for
m  0. there is an additional pole on the physical strip in the case of n  0 (but still n+m > 0)
in the rst block in the third line. this pole can be explained in terms of the reection process
in gure 11. it can be checked that the reections in the centre of diagrams 10(c) and 11 occur
at a zero in the corresponding reection amplitudes, and therefore these diagrams yield simple
poles, as expected.

now we turn to the case of n + m = 0 which is slightly dierent. in this case the second and

fourth line in (6.7) cancel each other and we get

note that a special phenomenon occurs whenever b = 1

2n with n integer. then the
states bna,n+a are degenerate with the states bn+a,n for all a > 0 and similarly the states
bn+a,na are degenerate with the states bn,n+a.

charge of the states against their energy.

4 toda theory in detail instead of a(1)

for purely accidental reasons we have studied a(1)
3 . however
a(1)
3 has a self-conjugate representation, as do all a(1)
n toda theories with n odd. this is a reason
why one might wish to look at a(1)
3 toda theory in detail. the single stationary soliton solutions
for solitons in the self-conjugate representation on the half-line have a slightly dierent form
from the others. usually the soliton solutions on the left half line are obtained by placing a
mirror antisoliton on the unphysical right half line. for the self-conjugate soliton the soliton
and its mirror antisoliton collapse into a single soliton because they are both stationary and
of the same type. one still obtains real-valued non-singular vacuum solutions after analytic
continuation of these solutions to real coupling. however one might expect that this dierence
in the classical theory might lead to some new phenomenon in the reection amplitudes for the
boundary conditions corresponding to a self-conjugate representation.

in the a(1)

3 toda theory the (+  +), ( + +) and (  ) boundary conditions
correspond to a soliton in the self-dual representation 2. we will give some of the reection
amplitudes for this case. the theory contains boundary states obtained by binding n1 particles
of type 1 and n3 particles of type 3 to the boundary. the reection amplitudes for particles of
type 1 and 2 reecting o these boundaries are

the pole in k n1,n3
on line (a) is due to the propagation of boundary state bn1+1,n3 in the direct
channel (similar to diagram 10(a)), that on line (b) is due to the propagation of boundary state
bn11,n2 in the crossed channel (similar to diagram 10(b)). the pole on line (c) is due to a
diagram similar to that in gure 11. also for the poles in k n1,n3
from the rst block on line (a)
and the rst block on line (b) one easily nds similar diagrams. this explains all poles for n1
and n2 positive.

however if the pole in k n1,n3

in line (b) is to be interpreted as being due to the propagation
of a state bn11,n3 this means that there will also have to be states with negative n1 as long as
n1+n2  0. the corresponding poles in k n1,0
also require states with negative n3. the reection
amplitude k n1,n3
develops additional poles in the rst block in line (c) if n1 < 0 and from the
rst block in line (c) if n3 < 0. these poles indicate the existence of more boundary bound
states. we have not performed the bootstrap calculations to determine the reection amplitudes
o these new states. thus it is an open question whether there is a consistent explanation of
all the poles in this case.

the rst class contains the boundary conditions ( + + + ), (+ + +  ), (+ +   +),

rst or fourth fundamental representation in front of the boundary. the corresponding vacuum

remains non-negative. the reection amplitudes o these boundary bound states are found to

and it is therefore sucient if we explain the pole structure of the reection amplitudes for
particles 1 and 2, the poles in the reection amplitudes for particles 3 and 4 are then explained
by the charge conjugated diagrams. if n2 + n3 equals to 0 or 1 then some coincidences occur in
the above products of blocks. we will therefore rst concentrate on the case n2 + n3 > 1.

has physical strip poles in lines (a) and (b) which are explained by the rst two
diagrams in gure 13. if n3  0 the pole from the rst factor on line (b) is not on the physical
sheet and diagram 13(b) does not exist. if n2  0 then the second factor on line (b) is on the
physical sheet and is explained by the third diagram in gure 13.

k (1)n2,n3

2

it can be checked that the reections in the middle of the three processes in gure 13 all
occur at a zero in the corresponding reection amplitudes, and therefore these diagrams yield
simple poles as expected.

the physical strip poles in k (1)n2,n3

can be explained by the diagrams in gures 14, 15 and
16. we have drawn diagram 15(d) for the case n2 > 0. if n2  0 then the diagram changes
slightly to 16(d). diagram 15(e) only exists if n2 > 0. for n2  0 the corresponding pole moves
o the physical strip. there is an additional pole on the physical strip in the case of n3 < 0 in
the second block in line (e) of k (1)n2,n3
. this pole can be explained in terms of diagram 16(e).
the diagrams 15 and 16 all have 13 internal lines and 5 loops. this would lead to a third
order poles. however it can be checked that the two reection factors appearing in every diagram
contribute a zero, thereby reducing the diagram to a simple pole. the scattering amplitudes
which appear in these diagrams do contribute neither a pole nor a zero. note that the diagrams
15(e) and 16(e) are not as symmetric as we have drawn, rather the two reections are taking
place at dierent angles, as indicated by the numbers in parentheses.

next we turn to the case of n2 = n3 which is rather special.

in k (1)n2,n3

there is a

cancellation between line (a) and line (d), leaving

in this case none of the diagrams in gure 13 exist, because they would all involve a state with

n2 + n3 < 0 which we postulated not to exist. the poles in line (b) from (cid:18) 5
(cid:18) 5

2(cid:19) correspond to the rst two processes in gure 17.

the pole in line (a) still receives a contribution from the process in gure 14(a). however this
pole does not satisfy the bootstrap equation which one would expect on the basis of gure 14(a).
the reason is that there is now a second diagram contributing to this pole, shown in gure 18(a).
the processes in gures 14(b) to 16(e) disappear, because they would involve boundary

states with n2 + n3 < 0. the pole in line (d) from(cid:18) 3

2  (2n + 1) b

2(cid:19) is explained by the diagram

18(d).

for a given b with 0 < b < 1 the following boundary bound states exist

bn2,n3 ,

for all integers n2, n3 with n2 + n3 > 0 and 

bn,n and bn,n ,

,

finally we consider the case where n2 = n3 + 1. in k (1)n2,n3

the two blocks in line (b)
coincide and give rise to a double pole. the reason for this is the fact that the reection process
in the middle of diagram 13(b) or 13(c) no longer provides a zero because it is a reection of a
boundary with n2 + n3 = 0. similarly in k (1)n2,n3
the blocks in line (c) combine with those in
line (d) to form double poles, as do the two blocks in line (e). again this is because one of the
reection amplitudes in each of the diagrams 14(c), 15(a), and 15(b) or 16(b) ceases to supply
a zero.

6.4.2 the second class of boundary conditions

the second class contains the boundary conditions ( + +  +), ( +  + +), (+ +  + ),
( +   ), (+  + + ), (+  +  +), (  +  ), (   + ), (    +) and (+    ).
their vacuum solutions are obtained by putting a soliton from the second or third fundamental
representation in front of the boundary. the corresponding vacuum reection amplitudes are

all of these reection amplitudes have a pole from a block(cid:18) 1

2(cid:19), indicating that all particles

can bind to the boundary. indeed we nd a whole lattice of boundary bound states bn1,n2,n3,n4.
for reasons to be explained below this lattice is restricted from below by the three conditions

n1 + n2  0,

n2 + n3  0,

n3 + n4  0.

(6.27)

as previously the array is also bounded above because the poles at which the bound states
are created move o the physical strip. using the usual bootstrap equations, the reection
amplitudes o these boundary bound states are found to be

if n1 = n2.

again the reection amplitudes for particles 3 and 4 are obtained by charge conjugation.
notice that these reection amplitudes for the second boundary condition contain those for the
rst boundary condition as a factor. we only need to explain the poles introduced by the new
additional factors. these all depend on n1 or n4 and must thus be due to diagrams involving the
emission or absorption of particles 1 or 4 from the boundary. for k (2)n1,n2,n3,n4
() the relevant
diagrams are displayed in gure 19, while for k (2)n1,n2,n3,n4

() they are given in gure 20.

1

diagram 20(j) exists only if n4 > 0. otherwise the corresponding pole lies o the physical
sheet. if n1  0 then diagram 20(i) changes to diagram 21(i). also if n1  0 then the second
pole in line (j) is on the physical sheet, and corresponds to diagram 21(j).

it is a fun exercise to go through all the special cases for which blocks in the reection ampli-
tudes coincide. for example if n4 + n1 = 0 then line (i) cancels against line (l). correspondingly
gures 20(i) and 21(i) no longer provide poles because the reection amplitudes in the middle
of those diagrams have double zeros. the disappearance of the zero in line (l) at n4 + n1 = 0 in
turn has the eect that diagrams 20(j) and 21(j) provide double poles if n4 + n1 = 1 which is
correct because then the two blocks on line (j) coincide.

if n1 + n2 = 0 then the pole on line (f) in k (2)n1,n2,n3,n4

disappears and thus diagram 19(f)
also has to disappear. that means that we need to exclude any boundary bound states with
n1 + n2 < 0. from the charge conjugated amplitudes we see that we also have to exclude states
with n4 + n3 < 0. this is the justication for the restriction on the lattice of states mentioned
above.

the poles in line (g) and (a) in k (2)n1,n2,n3,n4

1

have a new explanation if n1 + n2 = 0 in terms

of the diagrams in gure 22, and diagram 13(c) and its corresponding pole disappear.

at n1 + n2 = 0 also the diagrams 14(b), 15(d), 16(d), 15(e), 20(i) 21(i) and 21(j) disappear.
most of the corresponding poles also disappear but the rst poles on lines (d) and (e) do not
and are explained by the two new diagrams in gure 23.

we should still draw more diagrams to explain new poles which become relevant if one of the

37

indices becomes suciently negative. however we imagine that the reader will be exhausted by
now and so are we and we will therefore stop here. clearly what is needed is a more systematic
treatment which could explain why everything falls into place so miraculously.

7 discussion

the most striking result of this paper is probably the fact that the boundary of real coupling
ane toda theory has such a rich spectrum of boundary states. already in the simplest case
of a(1)
2 toda theory the spectrum is rather intricate, as displayed in gures 1 and 2. the pole
structure of the reection amplitudes necessitates the existence of these states. if one of them
were absent there would be unexplained poles. however we can not exclude the possibility that
there might be even more states. there are many simple poles in the reection amplitudes
which we were able to explain by anomalous threshold diagrams and for which we therefore did
not have to introduce new boundary states. however it is possible that some of the anomalous
threshold poles mask genuine bound state poles. this does happen in the s-matrices of non
self-dual ane toda theories [15, 10]. whether it happens in a(1)
n toda theory with a boundary
could only be decided if one were able to calculate the residues of the anomalous threshold
poles and compare them to the actual residues of the poles in the reection amplitudes to see
if there is a mismatch. such calculations were carried out in perturbation theory for the toda
s-matrices [6, 15] but we do not know how to perform such calculations in the presence of the
boundary.

another result of this paper, which was not obvious from the classical analysis, is that many
classically dierent integrable boundary conditions are equivalent at the quantum level, in the
sense that they give rise to the same boundary states and the same reection amplitudes.

when the classical real-valued vacuum solutions of a(1)

n toda theory with solitonic boundary
conditions were obtained in [16] it was remarked that they contain a continuous parameter. we
were wondering what consequence this vacuum degeneracy would have in the quantum theory.
for the (      ) boundary condition of a(1)
2n+1 toda theory this degeneracy had been
observed earlier in [22]. in that paper it was implied that the vacuum degeneracy implies that
the theory is unstable. we disagree with that interpretation. the present paper shows that
it is consistent to assume that the quantum theory picks a unique stable vacuum state.

we have derived reection amplitudes for those integrable boundary conditions which satisfy
the constraint that the product of all boundary parameters is +1. these are the boundary
conditions for which non-singular real vacuum solutions can be obtained by analytic continuation
of stationary soliton solutions. we have no results for those boundary conditions for which the
product of all boundary parameters is 1.

the durham group had made a conjecture in [11] for the boundary conditions which has all
ci = 1. for n odd this is a solitonic boundary condition of type (n + 1)/2 and we can compare
their conjecture with our result. not surprisingly our results dier because the calculations
in [11] were based on a constant vacuum, whereas we use a vacuum obtained by continuing

38

a stationary soliton solution, which has the same energy as the constant solution. so these
theories appear to have two dierent vacuum sectors. for the (+ +    + +) boundary condition
on the other hand the constant solution is the lowest energy solution and the conjecture made
in [11] does agree with our result (3.16).

the results of this paper are of course not rigorous. at several stages we had to make
assumptions. we will list the most important ones here so that the reader can decide how much
condence he wants to put into them.

1) we have assumed that the scalar factor of the soliton reection matrix is given by eq.(3.9)
which was the minimal solution of the equations (3.8). however there is the freedom of including
cdd factors of the form (3.24). we believe that inclusion of any of these cdd factors would
lead to an inconsistent pole structure after bootstrap, but we have not performed a careful
analysis of this. the semiclassical comparision between or reection matrix and the classical
time delay which we have performed does not detect the cdd factors.

2) we have assumed that the classical solutions to the solitonic boundary conditions found
in [16] are indeed the solutions of lowest energy. the calculations performed during the work
on [16] have given us strong condence that this is indeed the case but we dont know of any
way to prove it.

3) the classical vacuum solutions which we use are obtained by analytic continuation to real
coupling of solutions describing a stationary soliton in front of the boundary in the imaginary
coupling theory. we have assumed that therefore also the particle reection amplitudes in
the real coupling theory are obtained by the same analytic continuation of the corresponding
breather reection amplitude in the imaginary coupling theory. this assumption can really only
be justied a posteriori by the fact that it has led to consistent results.

clearly, we have not exhausted the subject of toda reection amplitudes in this paper.
while we have indeed given the reection amplitudes for all known vacuum solutions satisfying
integrable boundary conditions, we have completely worked out the reection amplitudes for
the excited boundary states only for two theories.

we have not discussed the special coincidences and truncations which can occur at special
rational values of the coupling constant. we have given an example of such a phenomenon at
the end of section 6.2 where a coupling constant b = 1
2n with n any integer leads to a degeneracy
in the spectrum.

furthermore, we have restricted our attention to the regime where the coupling constant
satises b < 1. the spectrum of bound states changes drastically as soon as b equals 1. the
study of the case b > 1 is related to the question of weakstrong duality. ane toda theory in
the bulk displays a fascinating weakstrong coupling duality under which   4
 or b  2  b.
in particular the s-matrices of a(1)
n toda theory are self-dual under this transformation of the
coupling constant. now that we have the reection amplitudes we can study the interesting
question of how s-duality works in the presence of boundaries. the only thing which we can say
so far is that the neumann boundary condition is dual to the (+ +    + +) boundary condition.
previously this duality had been observed in the sine-gordon model [14] and the a(1)
theory
2
[26].

without having to do any detailed comparisons we can immediately say that none of the

39

reection amplitudes which we have calculated coincide with the reection amplitudes which had
been conjectured in [21, 31, 32, 35]. these papers had assumed that the reection amplitudes
should be invariant under b  2  b which ours manifestly are not.

working out the explanation of the pole structure of the reection amplitudes in the examples
2 and a(1)
of a(1)
4 toda theory has been rather tedious. however it has been quite fascinating to see
the miraculous way in which these toda theories have managed to be consistent. but miracles
demand to be studied and (eventually) understood. this probably will require more cases for
more dierent algebras to be worked out. it should be possible to give explicit formulas for the
particle reection factors o the excited boundary states in a(1)
n theories for general n, starting
from our formula (5.5) for the particle reection amplitudes o the vacuum boundary state.

to extend the results to algebras other than a(1)

n one will have to repeat the analysis of section
3 to nd the soliton reection matrices as solutions of the corresponding reection equations and
then the breather reection amplitudes by bootstrap. to formulate the reection equations one
will need to use the soliton s-matrices which are known for many algebras [24]. we suspect that
again the simplest diagonal solutions of the reection equations will correspond to the uniform
(+ +    + +) boundary condition. because in all studied cases it has been found that the
particle s-matrices are obtained from the breather s-matrices by analytical continuation to real
coupling, it is to be expected that the same will hold for the reection amplitudes.

to nd the reection amplitudes for other integrable boundary conditions we used our knowl-
edge of the corresponding vacuum solutions from [16]. the results of that paper can also be
used to nd vacuum solutions for the solitonic boundary conditions in c(1)
n toda theories and
therefore the analysis of this paper could be carried over to those cases. clearly one would like
to eventually go beyond a case-by-case analysis and obtain general formulas for the reection
amplitudes. would formulas as elegant as those provided by dorey [19] for the s-matrices in
terms of root systems be possible?

we hope that the exact results for the reection amplitudes, which we have given in this
paper, will be a useful guide in the attempts to generalise standard quantum eld theoretic
techniques to eld theories with boundaries. for example, perturbation theory in the presence
of a non-constant boundary background is a non-trivial matter. so far only one-loop calculations
for constant backgrounds have been performed [32, 34] and our results conrm them.
