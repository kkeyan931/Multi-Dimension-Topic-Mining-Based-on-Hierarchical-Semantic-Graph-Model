abstract

we develope the analogue of s-duality for linearized gravity in (3+1)-dimensions. our

basic idea is to consider the self-dual (anti-self-dual) curvature tensor for linearized gravity

in the context of the macdowell-mansouri formalism. we nd that the strong-weak coupling

duality for linearized gravity is an exact symmetry and implies small-large duality for the

cosmological constant.

1.- introduction

it is well known that linearized einstein gravitational theory in four dimensions is similar

to the source free maxwell theory. since s-duality has been successfully applied to abelian

gauge theories and non-abelian gauge theories [1-10] as well as gravity [11-15], it seems

natural to ask whether similar methods may be applied to linearized gravity. however,

while in the abelian case there is an exact strong-weak duality, yang-mills and gravity do

not possess such a symmetry.

in this work, we show that in spite of gravity, in general, does not possess an exact

strong-weak symmetry linearized gravity does. in fact, we derive a s-dual action for lin-

earized gravity which is connected to the original linearized gravitational action by strong-

weak duality transformation. our strategy essentially consists in two steps; rst in writing

linearized gravity as abelian gauge theory and second taking recourse of the macdowell-

mansouri formalism.

just as u(1) duality has been very important to explore s-duality in larger theories such

as n = 2 super yang-mills theory with gauge group su(2) [16-17], one should expect that

linearized gravitational duality may also be an important tool for investigating s-duality

analogue of other theories such as n = 1 supergravity in four dimensions.

the plan of this work is as follows: in section ii, we show that it is possible to see lin-

earized gravity as an abelian gauge theory. in section iii, we briey review the macdowell-

mansouri theory and propose an action for linearized gravity in the context of such a theory.

in section iv, we generalize our proposed action to include self-dual and anti-self-dual lin-

earized gravity and we compute the partition function of such a generalized action. finally,

in section v, we make some nal comments.

2.- linearized gravity as a gauge theory

the starting point in linearized gravity is to write the metric of the space-time g =

g(x) as

g =  + h ,

where h is a small deviation of the metric g from the minkowski metric

() = diag(1, 1, 1, 1).

the rst-order curvature tensor is

f =

1
2

(h  h  h +  h),

which is invariant under the gauge transformation

h =  + ,

here,  is an arbitrary vector eld and   

x .

it is not dicult to see that f satises the following relations:

f = f = f = f ,

f + f + f = 0,

f + f +  f = 0.

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

it is interesting to note that the dual f  1

2  f  

 , where  is a completely

antisymmetric levi-civita tensor with 0123 = 1 and the indices are raised and lowered by

means of  and , does not satisfy the relations (4) unless the vacuum einstein equations

f = f 

 = 0 are satised [18].

let us introduce the gauge eld

3

a =

1
2

(h  h).

note that a = a. using (3), we nd that a transforms as

a = ,

where  =   .

the expression (5) allows to write the curvature tensor f 

 as

f 
 = a

  a
 .

(5)

(6)

(7)

thus, we have shown that the tensor f 

 may be written in the typical form of an abelian

maxwell eld strength f a

 = aa

   aa

, where the index a runs over some abelian group

such as u(1)  u(1)  ...  u(1). note that f 


is invariant under the transformation

a

 =  which has exactly the same form as the transformation of abelian gauge

elds aa

 = a, where a is an arbitrary function of the coordinates x.

3.- linearized gravity a la macdowell-mansouri

the central idea in the macdowell-mansouri theory [19-20] (see also refs.

[21-31]) is

to represent the gravitational eld as a connection one-form associated to some group that

contains the lorentz group as a subgroup. the typical example is provided by the so(3,2)

anti-de sitter gauge theory of gravity.

in this case the so(3,2) gravitational gauge eld

ab

 =  ba



is broken into the so(3,1) connection ab

 and the 4a

 = ea

 vierbein eld.

thus, the anti-de sitter curvature

rab

 = ab

  ab

 + ac

  b

c  ac

  b

c

leads to

rab

 = rab

 + ab



4

(8)

(9)

and

where

r4a

 = ea

  ea

 + ac

 ec  ac

rab

 = ab

   ab

 + ac

  b

c  ac

  b

c

is the so(3,1) curvature and

ab

 = ea

eb

  ea

.

it turns out that t a

  r4a

 can be identied with the torsion.

the macdowell-mansouris action is

s =

1

4 z d4xrab

rcd

abcd,

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

where  is the completely antisymmetric tensor associated to the space-time, with 0123 =

1 and 0123 = 1, while abcd is also the completely antisymmetric tensor but now associated

to the internal group s(3,1), with 0123 = 1. we assume that the internal metric is given

by (ab) = (1, 1, 1, 1). therefore, we have 0123 = 1. it is well known that, using (9), (11)

and (12), the action (13) leads to three terms; the hilbert einstein action, the cosmological

constant term and the euler topological invariant (or gauss-bonnet term).

it is worth

mentioning that the action (13) may also be obtained using lovelock theory (see [32] and

references there in).

let us now apply the macdowell-mansouri formalism to linearized gravity as developed

in section 2.

first, consider the extended curvature

f 

 = f 

 + 
 ,

where



 = 

 h

  

h

  

 h

 + 

 h
.

5

(14)

(15)

the central idea is to consider the extended curvature (14) as the analogue of the curvature

(9) of the macdowell-mansouri formalism. thus, we may identify f 

 and 

 with the

linearized versions of rab

 and ab

 , respectively. in fact, if we write ea

 = ba

 + la

, where ba


corresponds to the at metric  and la

 is a small deviation of ea

 , we nd h = ba

lb

ab +

ba
 lb

ab and therefore using (5) we get a = (la

)+f. here, (la

) = babbab

 (la
)

and f = bala

  bala

. (it is important to note that ab

 (la

) can be obtained by setting the

torsion (10), for weak gravity, equal to zero.) thus, up to a gauge transformation a is

equal to the linearized connection ab

 (la

). the essential dierence between ab

 (la

) and the

full connection ab

 is that the latter is associated to the lorentz group while the former to

an abelian group. this can easily be seen from the transformation a

 =  of the

gauge eld a

 , since in general a gauge eld a transforms as a =  + [a, ].

let us now propose the action

s =

1

4 z d4xf  

 f 

 .

(16)

we shall show that this action is reduced to einstein linearized gravitational action (fierz-

pauli action ) with cosmological constant and a total derivative (topological term). sub-

stituting (14) into (16) yields

s = 1

4 r d4x f  

 f 

   + 1

2 r d4x 

 f 

  

using (15) we nd that (17) is reduced to

+ 1
4 r d4x 



 .

s = 1

4 r d4x f  

 f 

   + 2r d4x 

h

 f 

  

(17)

(18)

+4r d4x 

h

 

h

 .

since 

  = 

 and  



  = 2

 , where in general 

  is a gener-

alized delta, we discover that (18) can be written as

6

s = 1

4 r d4x f  

 f 

   + 8r d4xh(f  1

2 f )

(19)

8r d4x(h2  hh).

here, we used the following denitions: f  f, f  f and h =  h.

we recognize the second term and the third term in (19) as the einstein action for linearized

gravity with cosmological constant, while the rst term is a total derivative (an euler topo-

logical invariant or gauss-bonnet term). note that the usual cosmological factor  in the

third term can be derived simply by changing   a2, where a is a constant, and rescaling

the total action s  1

4 1s, with  = a2.

4.- s-duality for linearized gravity

in order to develope a s-dual linearized gravitational action we generalize the action (16)

as follows;

s =

1
4

( +)z d4x +f  



+f 

  

1
4

( )z d4x f  



f 

 ,

where  + and   are two dierent constant parameters and f 

 is given by

where

f 

 = (

1
2

)m 

  f  
 ,

m 

  =

1
2

(

   i

 ).

(20)

(21)

(22)

it turns out that +f 

 is self-dual, while f 

 is anti self-dual curvature. therefore, the

action (20) describes self-dual and anti-self-dual linearized gravity.

we may now follow a similar procedure as in the references [5-8] for abelian yang-mills

and [11, 14, 15] for gravity. here, however, in order to show the exactness of s-duality

symmetry in linearized gravity, it turns out to be more convenient to follow the procedure

7

of reference [1] due to witten. for this purpose let us rst introduce a two form g and let

us set

h

  f 

  g
 .

(23)

we assume that g

 satises the same symmetric properties as f 

 , given in (4), namely

g = g = g = g ,

g + g + g = 0.

now, consider the extended action

se = 1

4( +)r dx4 +h 



+h

   1

4( )r dx4 h  



(24)

(25)

h

 

+ 1
2 r d4x +w 



+g

   1

2 r d4x w 



g

 ,

where w = v   v is the dual eld strength satisfying the dirac quatization

law

z w  2z.

(26)

it is not dicult to see that, beyond the gauge invariance a  a d, g  g, the partition

function

is invariant under

z = z d+gdgdadhdv ese

a  a + b and g  g + db,

(27)

(28)

where b


is an arbitrary one form.

starting from (25) one can proceed in two dierent ways. for the rst possibility, we

note that the path integral that involves v is

z dv exp(

1

2 z d4x +w 



+g

  

8

1

2 z d4x w 



g

 ).

(29)

integrating over the dual connection v , we get a delta function setting dg = 0. thus, using

the gauge invariance (28), we may gauge g to zero, reducing (25) to the original action (20).

therefore, the actions (25) and (20) are, in fact, classically equivalents.

for the second possibility, we note that the gauge invariance (28) enables one to x a

gauge with a = 0. (it is important to note that, at this stage, we are considering a and

h as independent elds in the sense of palatini.) the action (25) is then reduced to

se = 1

4( +)r dx4 +g 



+ 1
2 r d4x +w 



where

+g

   1

4( )r dx4 g 



g

 

+g

   1

2 r d4x w 



g

 ,

g 
   

  g 
 .

in virtue of (31) the extended action (30) becomes

se = 1

4( +)r dx4 +g 



+g

4( )r dx4 g 



g

before integrating h, let us consider the identity

m  


m 

   = 4im

(33)

which can be obtained from the denition (22). here, m = m  

  . using this

identity and the denition (15) for  

 we obtain

 ,

b

 = {( +)+g

}

b =

( +   ).

using (34)-(37) we learn that the action (32) can be written as

se = 1

 .

we note that the third and fourth term in (38) have exactly the same form as the second

and third term of (17). therefore, using the denition (15) for  

 and making similar

calculations for obtaining (19) we get

se = 1

where b  b, and b   b. note that b plays the role of a cosmological

constant.

we can now integrate out h in the reduced partition function

10

z = z d+gdgdhdv ese ,

with se given by (39). we rst get the relation

b 

1
2

b = 2b( h  h).

using this expression the action se given in (39) becomes

se = 1

before we perform the integrals over +g 

 and g 

 we still need to rearrange the third

integral of (42). for this purpose let us introduce the denition

b = c   c.

(43)

note rst that b = 3c. therefore, we nd 1

the identity

(49)

we are ready to perform the path integral of (48) with respect to +g 

 (similarly for

( +) s

(50)

it is not dicult to see that ( +)+g

(53). the action (54) is, of course, the dual action. note that the action (54) has the dual

gauge invariance v  v  d and is of the general type (20) but with    1

 , where 

can be either  + or  . therefore, we have shown that the coupling transforms as    1


when one changes from the action (20) to the action (54). it is interesting to note that 

plays the role of dual perturbation metric.

5.-final comments

in this article, we have shown that it is possible to construct a s-dual action for linearized

gravity. our two main ideas were to rewrite linearized gravity as an abelian gauge theory and

to take recourse of macdowell-mansouri formalism. the analysis of s-duality for a linearized

gravity then follows as in the case of abelian gauge theories. an important step was the

realization that the transformation (28) provides with enough symmetry to set a = 0. after

some long computations we nally prove that the partition function for linearized gravity

has the s-dual symmetry

za,h( ) = zv,(

1


),

13

(57)

where za,h( ) is the partition function associated to the action (20), while zv,( 1

 ) is the

partition function associated to the action (54).

it seems that the present work can be extended without essential complications to the

case of linearized supergravity. as it is known, the weak eld limit of supergravity in four

dimensions reduces to the sum of the fierz-pauli and rarita-schwinger actions, which are

the unique actions for spin 2 and 3/2 without ghost (see [31] and references there in). this

means that we can write the partition function for linearized supergravity as a product of

two partition functions: one corresponding to linearized gravity and the other correspond-

ing to rarita-schwinger eld. taking recourse of self-dual and antiself-dual supergravity

and considering separately self-dual-antiself-dual linearized gravity and self-dual-antiself-

dual rarita-shwinger, one can nd the linearized supergravity-s-dual symmetry . for lin-

earized gravity one may proceed as in previous sections, while for rarita-schwinger eld

one may use the method developed in reference [11]. in this way, one should expect to get

the s-dual linearized supergravity symmetry za,h,( ) = zv,,( 1

 ), where  is the rarita-

shwinger eld and  its dual. at present, we are investigating in detail this possibility and

we expect to report our results in the near future.

it is known that the s-duality gauge invariance is a matter of great interest in connection

with m-theory [33-39] and supersymmetry [1,16,17] it may be interesting to see whether the

present work can be useful in those directions.

finally, it is worth mentioning the physical meaning, as well as the possible relevance,

of the strong coupling limit of linearized gravity. for this purpose, we rst need to clarify

the physical meaning of the coupling constants  + and  . write the action (16) as

s =

1

16 z d4xf  

 f 

 .

(58)

as was mentioned at the end of the section 3,  can be identied with the cosmological

constant. now, using (22) it is not dicult to see that the action (20) can be reduced to

s =

1
8

( +   )z d4xf  

 f 

  +

i
8

14

( + +  )z d4xf  

 f 

 .

(59)

thus, if we consider the expressions

 + =

2

we nd that the action (59) can be written as

if we now recall the case of gauge theory where  + and   are dened as

 + =

  =

(60)

(61)

(62)

we see that the cosmological constant  is playing the role the gauge coupling constant g2 and

that  is playing the role of a  constant. just as in gauge theory the duality transformation

   1

 , where  can be either  + or  , can be considered, in its simple form, as a duality

of the gauge coupling constant g2  1

g2 , in the case of linearized gravity (according to (60))
 can be considered as a duality of the cosmological constant   1
 .

the duality    1

this result seems to suggest a new mechanism to make small the cosmological constant, at

least in linearized gravity (although similar conclusions must be possible in more general

cases as in references [11]-[15]). in particular, the mechanism discussed in this work may

be of physical interest in kaluza-klein theories where in the process called spontaneous

compactiction, normally, results a very large cosmological constant.
