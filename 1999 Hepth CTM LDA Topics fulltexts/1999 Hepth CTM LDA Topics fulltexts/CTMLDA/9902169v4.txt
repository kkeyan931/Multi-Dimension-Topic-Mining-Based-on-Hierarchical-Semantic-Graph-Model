abstract

we suggest that the boundary cosmological constant  in c < 1 unitary string theory be re-

garded as the one-dimensional complex coordinate of the target space on which the boundaries

of world-sheets can live. from this viewpoint we explicitly construct analogues of d-instantons

which satisfy polchinskis combinatorics of boundaries. we further show that our operator

formalism developed in the preceding articles is powerful in evaluating d-instanton eects, and

also demonstrate for simple cases that these eects exactly coincide with the stringy nonper-

turbative eects found in the exact solutions of string equations.

recent progress has revealed the vital role of d-branes [1] in the nonperturbative aspects

of string theory. for understanding nonperturbative dynamics which arises from the d-branes,

it has been particularly important to consider the combinatorics of boundaries of world-sheets.

in fact, polchinski made an interesting observation sometime ago [2] that the stringy non-
perturbative eects of the form ec /g [3] (g is the coupling constant of closed strings) could
be explained in terms of the combinatorics of boundaries in a target space with d-instanton

background. the point is that when summing up connected diagrams in such target space, one

should take into account not only connected world-sheets, but also congurations where discon-

nected world-sheets are attached together at a d-instanton. then in the weak coupling limit,
the dominant contribution comes from the disk amplitude c/g for each world-sheet, which
will be accumulated to the form ec /g after summing over the number of attached world-sheets.

in order to investigate such many-boundary systems, however, it should be more natural

and convenient to use quantum string elds which can create and annihilate the boundaries of

world-sheets. furthermore, if we can introduce the quantum elds that create loop boundaries

of dirichlet type, then the interactions and combinatorics of d-branes can be dealt with in

a second-quantized way. though for critical strings it seems dicult to fully carry out this
program in string-eld language at hand,1 there might be a chance to do it for c  1 unitary
case, because almost all the dynamical variables can be gauged away with 2d dieomorphism,

leaving the external lines only zero-modes (the positions). this implies that the string eld

theory could reduce to a local eld theory in this case. we will show that actually the string
eld theory for c = 1  6/p(p + 1) (p = 2, 3, ...) reduces to a chiral 2d conformal eld theory
by identifying the target-space coordinate with the so-called boundary cosmological constant

. in particular, the solitons dab constructed by the present authors [5, 6] (to be described
below) are interpreted as analogues of d-instantons and shown to satisfy combinatorics similar

to that of polchinski.

we start our discussion with recalling that noncritical c = 1 string theory is a d = 2 critical
string theory with linear dilaton background [7]: g(x) =  = diag(1, +1), b(x) = 0
and (x) = (q/2)x 1, where x  ( = 0, 1) are coordinates of target space, and g(x),
b(x) and (x) are, respectively, the background metric, antisymmetric 2-tensor and dila-
ton. upon requiring the nl model with this background to be invariant under the weyl

transformation as well as the 2d dieomorphism, the value of q is uniquely determined up to

sign (which can be absorbed into a redenition of x 1) as q = q2(26  d)/3 = 4/, and

1 an attempt in critical string eld theory can be found in [4], where the interaction between a d-brane and

a closed string eld are investigated by coupling the string eld to the boundary state.

this solution has no higher  corrections since the system is essentially gaussian (hereafter we
take the cft unit,  = 2). the nl-model action with this linear dilaton term has exactly
the same form with that of liouville gravity coupled to c = 1 conformal matter if a spatial
coordinate is regarded as liouville eld,  = x 1:

s[x ] = z d2qg( 1

ric such that its geodesic curvature vanishes.)
only the 2d dieomorphism on a nl model with a scalar eld x 0 (with negative metric)
and express the world-sheet metric as gab = egab which uctuates around a xed metric gab.
furthermore, the c < 1 case can be realized from c = 1 (d = 2) by making a lorentz boost
on (x 0, x 1)  (x 0 cosh   x 1 sinh , x 0 sinh  + x 1 cosh ) as well as on q with hyper-
bolic angle e = (1  c + 25  c)/26 [10], and the corresponding nl-model action with

vanishing cosmological constant would be (after the wick rotation x = ix 0):

in 2d gravity we can introduce the macroscopic-loop operator (l) [11] that is dened
eectively as creating a loop boundary of length l on the random surface. its laplace transform

is dened with the boundary cosmological constant  as ()  r 0 dl el (l), and when
c = 1  6/p(p + 1) it is expanded around  =  (equivalently l = 0) as

() =

p xn onn/p1,

where ons are scaling operators and have the following form [8, 9]:

on = z d2qg en() einx(),

(3)

(4)

with n = 0(n2p1) and n = 0(n1) [9]. note that these operators are also invariant
under the shift x  x + 2/0. this implies that the external on-shell states eectively live
on a target space with the x-direction compactied with radius 1/0, while the bulk of the
world-sheet lives whole in the 2d target space. this is a specialty of the discrete unitary series.

now we are going to argue that this  could be regarded as a coordinate of target space.

one justication comes from the 2d-gravity side. in fact, in the matrix-model regularization

3

of this system, the () is obtained as the continuum limit of the resolvent of a random matrix
m, f (p ) = tr (p  m)1, by setting p = pc ea with pc the convergence radius of h f (p )i
around p =  and a the lattice spacing. on the other hand, according to our experience in
any matrix models which generate random surfaces in c-dimensional target space (see [12] for

example), the argument of the resolvent is always identied with an extra coordinate of target

space (thus totally d = c + 1-dimensions). this motivates us to identify  with a coordinate

of target space.

this idea can be elaborated more if we stand on the string-theory side. in fact, substituting

eq. (4) into (3), we have

()  z d2qg xn

 z d2qg

en0() ein0x() n/p

1

 1/p  e0(()+ix()) .

(5)

here we have used en0(()+ix()) em0(()+ix())  e(n+m)0(()+ix()), since the singulari-
ties from contact interaction both for  and x cancel each other. we also neglected possible

coecients on the right hand side of (4) which would not give essential changes to the sin-
gularity behavior in (5). noticing that the whole expression includes only  (not ),2 and
also that the integrand is a delta function in a complex plane, we thus see that the role of

() is substantially to create a loop boundary in one-dimensional complex target space with
the (exponentiated) coordinate . furthermore, due to the form  1/p, any observables should
be invariant under the rotation   e2ip which corresponds to the shift x  x  2/0.
although the above arguments might require to be rened more, we may conclude that the

on-shell boundaries live on a complex one-dimensional target space with a chiral coordinate 
with periodicity   e2ip, and the role of the operator () is to pin the world-sheet at the
point  1/p = e0(+ix).

an operator formalism of c < 1 string eld theory is developed in [5, 6]. there the string

eld () is expressed as the rst derivative of a scalar eld 0(), and has the following mode

expansion under the zp-twisted vacuum |  i: ()  0() = (1/p)pnz nn/p1 with
[n, m] = n n+m,0 and n |  i = 0 (n  0). it thus raises a monodromy among p scalar elds
a() (a = 0, 1, ..., p  1) as a(e2i) = [a+1]() with [a]  a (mod p). the correlation
functions (generally disconnected) are then given by

h (1)    (n)i  z

dl1    dln el11lnn d (l1)    (ln)e

2 this is also a specialty of c < 1. for c = 1 there will appear both  and  as well as extra discrete states.
the relationship between c = 1 and c < 1 is reminiscent of the one between ads3 and ads2 in the ads/cft

correspondence [13].

and the connected correlation functions are obtained as their cumulants. here the normal order-

characterizes the theory and corresponds schematically to the nl-model action s = p2p+1

here ca() and ca() (a = 0, 1, ..., p 1) are fermions constructed from the scalars by bosoniza-
tion:

ca() = ka : ea() :,

ca() = ka : ea() :,

(9)

where ka is a cocycle factor that ensures the correct anticommutation relations between dif-
ferent indices a 6= b, and all the operators are again normal-ordered with respect to sl(2, c)
in addition to the w1+ constraints, we further require that | i be a
invariant vacuum.
decomposable state.3

now we try to construct the d-instanton operator in this operator formalism. by denition

it should be expressed as an operator that species a point  at which boundaries of world-sheets

are glued together (see fig. 1). since there exists a redundancy reecting the invariance under

one-dimensional dieomorphism along each boundary, this should be gauge-xed if one would

like to count only independent congurations. this can be simply done by creating strings at
 not with 0() but with 0(), since for the latter the redundancy that is proportional
to loop length is automatically divided out: 0()  r 0 dlel (1/l) (l). taking also into
account the monodromy of scalar elds, we should equally treat all the a()s as such gauge-
xed string elds. thus, after summing over the number of the boundaries glued at , we
a /n!) (a())n = exp {qaa()}, where 1/n! is a statistical factor and we assume
have pn(qn
3 a state | i is called decomposable if it is written as | i = eh |  i, where h is a bilinear form of the
fermions. this is equivalent to the statement that  (x) = h  | exp{p
n=1 xnn} | i is a  function of the
kp hierarchy [19]. it is proved in [17] that this set of conditions (w1+ constraints and decomposability) is
equivalent to the douglas equation [20], [p, q] = 1.

are mapped to a single point  in the target space.

that a boundary of a connected world-sheet is accompanied with weight qa for each a().
furthermore, we need to make an integration over the collective coordinate  of d-instanton.
the path of the integration surrounds  =  p times, which corresponds to the integration over
x with 0  x  2/0. we are thus lead to the following partition function of n d-instantons:

zn = i p

d1   i p

dn * n
yi=1

e~q~(i)+ ,

(10)

where ~q~(i) = pp1

a=0 qaa(i) and i represents the collective coordinate of the i-th d-instanton.
note that this equation actually realizes polchinskis combinatorics of boundaries [2]. after

summing over n, we obtain the grand-canonical partition function:

z =

n
n!

zn



xn =0

= (cid:28) exp(cid:26)i p

d e~q~()(cid:27)(cid:29) ,

(11)

where 1/n! is a statistical factor and  is a fugacity. equations (10), (11) imply that our

d-instanton can be identied with an object which locally couples to the scalar elds a() at
the position  with charges qa.

this is not the end of story. in fact, the charges qa in (11) cannot take arbitrary values,

since in order for the expression to give a correct background, the state expnh p d e~q~()o| i

6

must satisfy the w1+ constraints when | i does. this is equivalent to the condition that
the operator h p d e~q~() should commute with any generators of the w1+ algebra, and it is
shown in [5] that, for this condition to hold, only two charges among qa can take nonvanishing
values with 1. this is actually the combination for which the operator can be expressed as a
fermion bilinear, and has exactly the same form with the operator dab that was introduced in
[5, 6]:

dab = i p d

2i

ca()cb()  i p d

2i

ea()b()

(a 6= b).

(12)

furthermore, since there are various ways to choose the pairs a and b, we can introduce the

corresponding fugacities ab, and nally have the following form instead of (11):

z = * ya6=b

exp {abdab}+ = * ya6=b

exp(cid:26)abi p

d ea()b()(cid:27)+ .

(13)

thus, we conclude that the dab is the operator that creates a d-instanton and the qa6=b eabdab

the creation operator of multi d-instantons. notice that in [6] the form of the multi d-instanton

operator was originally determined by requiring that the decomposability be preserved when
acting on | i.

in the rest of this article, we briey explain how the nonperturbative eects due to d-

instantons can be calculated in our operator formalism, and show that they coincide with those

eects that were found in exact solutions of string equations. most of the argument here will

closely follow [5, 6], and to make the comparison most easily, we mainly consider the string

susceptibility in the d-instanton background:

where t and g are the cosmological and string coupling constant, respectively, and we have
set b1 = t, b2p+1 = 4p/((p + 1)(2p + 1)), bn = 0 (n 6= 1, 2p + 1). the free energy
e in (14) can be evaluated around  = 0 by rewriting it as follows:
e ab dab(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where

(15)

(16)

thus, expanding eabdab in (15) with respect to ab and picking up only the rst-order term, we
get the string susceptibility which includes one-d-instanton eect:

u(t, g, ) = upert(t, g) + g2xa6=b

ab 2

t h dab i + o(2

ab).

(17)

here upert(t, g) is the string susceptibility which is perturbatively evaluated at ab = 0. we will
make a comment on multi-d-instanton eects later.

the expectation value of dab in (17) can be represented as

h dab i = i p d

since a connected n-point function has the following expansion in g:

h a1(1)    an(n)ic =



xh=0h a1(1)    an(n)i(h)

c g2+2h+n,

+   (cid:27) .

(18)

(19)

we know that in the weak coupling limit, leading contributions to the exponent come from

spherical topology (h = 0):

h dab i = i p d

2i

e (1/g) ab() + (1/2) kab() + o(g)

(20)

with ab()  h a()  b()i(0) and kab()  h (a()  b())2 i(0)
. these functions
ab() and kab() can be calculated by integrating the disk and cylinder amplitudes (h ()i(0)
and h (1)(2)i(0)
c ) [11] followed by analytic continuation. for example, ab() can be eval-
uated as

c

ab() = h a()i(0)  h b()i(0)

= d 0(e2ia)e(0)

d 0(e2ib)e(0)

d h ()i(0)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)e2ib

.

(21)

thus, the leading contribution in the weak coupling limit can be calculated by applying the

saddle point method in the complex  plane. to do so, it is convenient to introduce a new

coordinate s which is dened by

s() =

1

t (cid:18) +q 2  t(cid:19) ,

8

(22)

for which ab(s) is expressed as

ab(s) = p (cid:20)

1

r + 1 n(a  b)sr+1 + (a  b)s(r+1)o
r  1 n(a  b)sr1 + (a  b)s(r1)o(cid:21) ,


1

(23)

where p = 21/p t(2p+1)/2p/(p + 1),  = e2i/p and r = (p + 1)/p. the saddle points are found
at s0 = e(npab)i/(p+1), which gives

ab(s0) =

8p

21/p  (2p + 1)

t

(24)

here n takes integers which satisfy ab(s0) < 0 (see [5, 6] for detailed investigations). they
give the leading nonperturbative eects that are proportional to e(1/g) ab(s0). coecients can
also be calculated explicitly by performing an integration around the saddle points (see [5, 6]).

next, we compare these nonperturbative eects with those that were found in the exact
solutions of string equations. in the p = 2 (pure gravity) case, the string equation is 4u2 +
(2g2/3)2
t u = t (painleve i equation) [21]. the leading nonperturbative eect can be calculated

by expanding the equation around upert = t/2 + o(g2) and is found to be u  u upert 
ec/g with c = 46 t5/4/5 [3, 21, 22]. this exponent coincides with 01(s0) with n = 0, 1 and

10(s0) with n = 3, 4 in (24).

for the p = 3 (ising) case, the string equation is 4u3 +(3g2/2)(tu)2 +3g2u2

t [23]. the leading nonperturbative eects are of the form ec/g with c = 66 t7/6/(21/3  7)
or 123 t7/6/(21/3 7). the set of these exponents agrees with that of dierent negative values

t u+(g4/6)4

t u =

of ab(s0) in (24).

we nally consider the p = 4 (tricritical ising) case. the string equations are now coupled

dierential equations for two unknown functions u and v [24]:

2v  2g4t
0 = 40u3 + 40uv + 15g2(tu)2 + 10g2ut
2u
5t = 20u4 + 40v2 + 50g2u(tu)2 + 20g2tutv + 20g2u2t
3u + 11g4ut

2u)2 + 13g4tut

2v + 11g4(t

2u + 10g2t

 20g2ut

4u

(25)

4u + g4t

4v.

(26)

the leading nonperturbative eects are of the form ec/g with c = 213/4q5  5 t9/8/9 or
211/4q5  5 t9/8/9. the set of these exponents completely accord with that of dierent

negative values of ab(s0) in (24).

moreover, we can also evaluate multi-d-instanton eects by using our formalism. as an

example, the p = 2 (pure gravity) case was considered in detail in [6] and the string susceptibility

9

in the multi-d-instanton background was obtained as

u(t, g, ) = 

t
2

+ 6 r g t1/8 e 46 t5/4/ 5g  (cid:16)1 + r g t5/8e 46 t5/4/ 5g(cid:17)2

.

(27)

here we have neglected contributions from higher topologies, and r is the renormalized fugacity
which absorbed an integration constant that arises when integrating cylinder amplitudes. this

u(t, g, ) exactly reproduces a series of nonperturbative corrections in the string equation for

pure gravity [6].

these examples conrm that the stringy nonperturbative eects found in the exact solutions

of string equations can be interpreted as d-instanton eects.

in this short letter, we demonstrate that the conformal eld theory that used to be a tech-

nical tool to compactly describe macroscopic-loop amplitudes, is actually the eld theory that

describes the target space where the boundaries of world-sheets live. we also explicitly construct

analogues of d-instantons which satisfy polchinskis combinatorics of boundaries. it is sur-

prising that our operator formalism can be naturally applied to this combinatorics. moreover,

we show that this formalism is powerful in evaluating the d-instanton eects and demonstrate

for p = 2, 3, 4 that these eects coincide with the stringy nonperturbative eects found in the

exact solutions of string equations. finally we point out the similarities between noncritical

strings and the sine-gordon theory (or more generally ane su(p) toda eld theories) since

for both the fundamental degrees of freedom are described by scalar elds a corresponding
to the fundamental weights (this is actually su(p), not u(p), because pp1
a=0 a = 0 under
the w1+ constraints), while the solitons are expressed by their exponentials in a combination
associated with the roots, exp (a  b).
