eichler integrals and string theory

abstract

in this article, it is shown how to obtain objects called eichler integrals in the mathematical
literature that can be used for calculating scattering amplitudes in string theory. these eichler
integrals are also new examples of eichler integrals with poles.

1

introduction

the concept of an eichler integral is closely related to the concept of automorphic forms. although
automorphic forms have a large range of applications in physics and, in particular in string theory,
eichler integrals remain relatively unknown objects to both mathematicians and physicists. one
can picture an eichler integral as a generalization of the concept of automorphic forms, and they
are related to the better known beltrami dierentials that are used in string theory, in particular
in the calculation of multiloop scattering amplitudes of strings.

this article begins with a description of the main properties of automorphic forms with some
examples that will be useful when we describe the new eichler integrals. the denition of eichler
integrals is given next, with some examples that can be used in string theory.

2 automorphic forms

an automorphic form of weight q is a function [1] (z) that transforms in the following way under
a projective transformation pa:

 (pa(z)) = (cid:20) pa(z)

z

(cid:21)q

(z) .

automorphic forms with just one pole will be more of our interest, since the order of the pole is
limited in a simple way by the riemann-roch theorem [2]. we now give some examples of these
functions.

2.1 example 1

a simple case of an automorphic form of weight q can be given for the case where there is just one
projective transformation p (z) given by

p (z) = w(z  ) +  ,

where  is the nite xed point of the transformation (the other xed point is at innity) and w is
the multiplier. an automorphic form (z) of weight q can then be given by

in the case where p (z) has two nite xed points, when it can be expressed by

(z) = (z  )q .

p (z) =

(x  )  w(z  )

(z  )  w(z  )

,

an automorphic form of weight q is given by

(z) = [(z  )(z  )]q .

2.2 example 2

in the case of a single projective transformation p (z) with just one xed point, we may have
automorphic forms with poles, given by

n(z) = (z  )q(cid:18) 

t(cid:19)n1

p(t) ,

t = ln(z  )  ln() ,

where n is the order of the pole and p(t) is the wierstrass p function [3] with periods ln w and
2i.

in the case of p (z) having two nite xed ponits, we have

(z) = [(z  )(z  )]q(cid:18) 

t(cid:19)n1

p(t) ,

instead.

2.3 example 3

t = ln(cid:18) z  

z  (cid:19)  ln(cid:18) 

(cid:19) ,

still another way of obtaining an automorphic form on a genus g riemann surface is considering
the following function [1] (called a poincare series):

(z, ) = xa (cid:20) dta(z)

dz

(cid:21)q

  k

ta(z)  

,

where k is an arbitrary constant and the sum pa is over all elements of the schottky group, which

is the group of all possible combinations of the projective transformations pb(z), b = 1, . . . , g.

under a transformation z  tb(z), one gets

 (tb(z), ) = xa (cid:20) dtatb(z)

dz

(cid:21)q

  k

tatb(z)  

.

2

we now perform a change of variables tatb(z) = tc(z). using the chain rule we have

d
dz

so that we have

tc(z) = (cid:20) d

dz

tatb(z)(cid:21) 
b(z)(cid:3)qxa (cid:20) dtc(z)

dz

d
dz

tb(z) ,

(cid:21)q

  k

tc(z)  

.

 (tb(z), ) = (cid:2)t 

since we are summing over all the elements of the schottky group, the series above is equivalent
to the original one, so that we have

i.e. it is an automorphic form of weight q.

 (tb(z), ) = (cid:2)t 

b(z)(cid:3)q (z, ) ,

2.4 example 4

in the multiloop case, let us consider only projective transformations pa with nite xed points a
and a. we then consider the following series:

pw(z) = xb

(z  b)(z  b)

wb(b  b)

wb


,

(1)

where the sum is over all the elements of the schottky group formed by these transformations and
wb and  are innitesimals. we then have that

[ta(z)  b] [ta(z)  b]

1

wb(b  b)

(a  waa  b + wab)(a  waa  b + wab)

=

t 
a(z)

pw (ta(z)) = xb
wa(a  a)2 xb
(cid:20)z 

(aa  waaa  ba + waba)

(a  waa  b + wab)

(cid:21)(cid:20)z 

(aa  waaa  ba + waba)

(a  waa  b + wab)

(cid:21) wb



.

making then the following change of variables:

c =

c =

(1  wa)aa  (a  waa)b

a  waa  (1  wa)b

(1  wa)aa  (a  waa)b

a  waa  (1  wa)b

,

,

wc = wb ,

pw (ta(z)) = t 

a(z)xc

(z  c)(z  c)

wc(c  c)

wc


,

wc =

wc
wb

wb .

we may write

where we have used

(2)

(3)

(4)

since we are summing over all elements of the schottky group (with the condition that the xed
points are nite), we then see that the expression on the right hand side is equivalent to the series
we started with, so that

pw (ta(z)) = t 

a(z)pw(z) .

3

we may also consider the following two series:

p(z) = xb
p(z) = xb

(1  wb)

wb(b  b)2 (z  b)2 b
wb(b  b)2 (z  b)2 b

(1  wb)





,

.

(5)

(6)

using the same change of variables (2)-(4) and the fact that

we then obtain

c =

c =

c
b
c
b

b =

b =

wa(a  a)2

[a  waa  (1  wa)b]2 b ,

wa(a  a)2

[a  waa  (1  wa)b]2 b ,

p (ta(z)) = t 
p (ta(z)) = t 

a(z)p(z) ,
a(z)p(z) .

we have then obtained three examples of automorphic forms with weight 1.

3 eichler integrals

an eichler integral of order q is dened in the following way [4] [5]:
transforms like

it is a function f (z) that

f (ta(z)) = (cid:20) ta(z)

z

(cid:21)q

hf (z) + p q+1(z)i ,

where p q+1(z) is a polynomial at most of order q + 1. it can be pictured as a generalization of the
concept of automorphic form. eichler integrals are related with automorphic forms in the following
way [4]: given an eichler integral f (z) of order q, we then have

(z) = (cid:18) 

z(cid:19)2q+1

f (z) ,

(7)

where (z) is an automorphic form of weight q + 1, i.e.

 (ta(z)) = (cid:20) ta(z)

z

(cid:21)q+1

(z) .

here are some examples of eichler integrals.

3.1 example 1

a trivial example of an eichler integral is given by any polynomial of order 2, i.e. any function of
the form

f (z) = a + bz + cz2 ,

where a, b, and c are constants. such a function transforms like

f (ta(z)) = t 

a(z)(cid:20)f (z) +

1

w(  )2 (d + ez + f z2)(cid:21) ,

4

where

d = (1  w)2a + (1  w)(  w)b hw2(1  w)  2w(  1) + w2i c ,

e = 2(w  )(1  w)a  2(1  w)2b + [2w( + )  2(w + )] c ,
f = (2  w2)(1  w)a + (1  w)(  w)b  w2(2  w)c .

dierentiating it three times, we obtain

d3
dz3 f (z) = 0 ,

which is a sort of automorphic form (a trivial one) so equation (7) holds.

3.2 example 2

there are not many examples of eichler integrals with poles in the literature. the rst one was
given by ahlfors [4]. in our notation, his eichler integral is given by

f (z, ) = xb

[z  tb()]1(cid:2)t 

b()(cid:3)q ,

where the sum is over all elements of the schottky group.

this function transforms in the following way:

f (ta(z), ) = (cid:2)t 

a(z)(cid:3)q1(f (z, ) +xb " t 

(t 

atb()
a(z))q1/2

 1# [z  tb()]1(cid:2)t 

b()(cid:3)q) .

(8)

(9)

the second term in the right hand side can be shown to be a polynomial of degree q. this eichler
integral has just one simple pole at  = z.

in order to obtain eichler integrals with poles of higher order, one just has to form derivatives

with respect to :

fk+1(z, ) =

k
 k f (z, )

where fk+1(z, ) is an eichler integral with a pole of order k + 1 at  = z.

3.3 example 3

as it will be shown now, not all eichler integrals must transform in such a complicated way. it is
not hard to nd examples of eichler integrals with simple and useful transformations.

as explained before, an eichler integral can be obtained by simply integrating an automorphic
form a certain number of times. it is possible to show that every automorphic form of weight q can
be expressed in terms of the following poincare series:

g(z, ) = xb (cid:2)t 

b(z)(cid:3)q

  k

tb(z)  

,

(10)

where k is an arbitrary constant.

if we now take the case q = 1 we have simply

g(z, ) = xb (cid:2)t 

b(z)(cid:3)1

  k

tb(z)  

(  k)(cid:20)

= xb

1

z + (bb  dd)/(ab  cb)



1

z + db/cb(cid:21) ,

5

and, by (7), we may obtain an eichler integral of weight zero simply by integrating this expression
once. doing this we obtain the following:

f (z, ) = xb

(  k) ln(cid:18)

cb

[(ab  cb)z + (bb  db)]

(ab  cb)

(cbz + db)

(cid:19) + c ,

where c is a constant of integration that can be set to zero.
we may then make the following change of coecients:

am = ab  cb
bm = bb  db

,

,

cm = cb ,
dm = db ,

and the function f (z, ) becomes simply

f (z, ) = xm

(  k) ln(cid:18) cm(amz + bm)

am(cm + dm) (cid:19) .

performing the conformal transformation

ta(z) =

aaz + ba
caz + da

with ca 6= 0 in the expression above, we obtain

f (ta(z), ) =xm

(  k) ln(cid:18) cm [am(aaz + ba) + bm(caz + da)]
am [cm(aaz + ba) + dm(caz + da)](cid:19) .

if we now make another change of variables,

ab = amaa + bmca
bb = amba + bmda

,

,

cb = cmaa + dmca ,
db = cmba + dmda ,

we then have

f (ta(z), ) = xb
= xb

(abda  cabb)

(  k) ln(cid:18) (cbda  cadb)
(  k)(cid:20)ln(cid:18) cb(abz + bb)

(abz + bb)

(cbz + db)(cid:19)

ab(cbz + db)(cid:19) + ln(cid:18) ab(cbda  cabb)

cb(abda  cabb)(cid:19)(cid:21) .

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

since we are summing over all transformations tb(z) with cb 6= 0, the rst term of expression

(16) is just f (z, ) and we then have

f (ta(z), ) = f (z, ) +xb

(  k) ln(cid:18) ab(dbaa  cbba)

cb(bbaa  abba)(cid:19) .

(17)

the second term of expression (17) can be readily identied as a constant, i.e. a polynomial in z
of degree 0, so that it is proved that the function f (z, ) is an eichler integral with weight 0.

we now consider automorphic form (10) with weight 2:

g(z, ) =xb (cid:2)t 

b(z)(cid:3)2

  k

tb(z)  

,

6

(18)

where k is a constant and the sum is over all elements of the schottky group. according to the
theory of eichler integrals, if we integrate an automorphic form of weight 2 three times we shall
obtain an eichler integral of weight 1.
if we take tb(z) to be of the form

we may then write this function in the following form:

tb(z) =

abz + bb
cbz + db

g(z, ) = xb

  k
ab  cb

1

(cbz + db)3 [z + (bb  db)/(ab  cb)]

.

this can be easily integrated. considering the case where cb 6= 0 and performing integration three
times on this automorphic form we obtain the following function:

(  k) [(ab  cb)z + (bb  db)]2

1
2

f (z, ) = xb
 ln(cid:18)

cb

[(ab  cb)z + (bb  db)]

(cid:19)

(ab  cb)

1

2(ab  cb)db + 1

(cb + db)
b (ab  cb)2 + c1z2 + c2z + c2
4c2

+

2cb(ab  cb)

z 

where c1, c2 and c3 are constants resulting from the integrations. choosing these integration
constants in such a way as to cancel with the polynomial part of expression (19) we then obtain

(19)

(20)

(21)

1
2

f (z, ) = xb
 ln(cid:18)

(  k) [(ab  cb)z + (bb  db)]2

cb

[(ab  cb)z + (bb  db)]

(ab  cb)

(cb + db)

(cid:19) .

we can now make the change of coecients (12) and the function f (z, ) becomes

f (z, ) = xm

1
2

(  k)(amz + bm)2 ln(cid:18) cm(amz + bm)
am(cm + dm) (cid:19) .

this expression should be an eichler integral and we are going to show it indeed is.

if we

perform the conformal transformation

with ca 6= 0 in the expression above, we obtain

ta(z) =

aaz + ba
caz + da

f (ta(z), ) = xm

(cid:21)2
(  k)(cid:20) am(aaz + ba) + bm(caz + da)

am [cm(aaz + ba) + dm(caz + da)] (cid:19) .

caz + da

(22)

(23)

if we now make another change of variables, given by (15), we then have

f (ta(z), ) = t

ab(cbz + db)(cid:19) + ln(cid:18) ab(dbaa  cbba)

cb(bbaa  abba)(cid:19)(cid:21) .(24)

since we are summing over all transformations tb(z) with cb 6= 0, the rst term of expression (24)
is just f (z, ), and we then have

f (ta(z), ) = t 

a(z)"f (z, ) +xb

1
2

(  k)(abz + bb)2 ln(cid:18) ab(dbaa  cbba)

cb(bbaa  abba)(cid:19)# .

(25)

the second term of expression (25) can be readly identied with a polynomial in z of degree 2

so that it is proved that the function f (z, ) is an eichler integral.

4 example 4

we consider now the case

t (z) =

az + d
cz + d

,

that can be written in terms of the nite xed point  and the multiplier w as

t (z) = w(z  ) +  .

(26)

(27)

in string theory, and in particular in the group theoretic approach [6], we will be interested
in functions that are associated with conformal transformations that cause innitesimal changes in
the moduli of a riemann surface with genus g. in one loop, i.e. a riemann surface with genus 1,
we have one nite xed point , one xed point at innity, and the multiplier w. in order to x the
modular invariance of the theory, we must x three variables. besides the one xed point that has
been already xed at innity, we can choose to x the nite xed point and one of the variables
associated with the incoming strings so that the multiplier w will be the only variable associated
with the loop left.

we then want a function that has the eect of changing the multiplier w innitesimally, i.e. we

want a function that transforms like

i.e.

and

f (t (z)) = t (z)f (z) 

t (z)

f (t (z)) = t (z)(cid:20)f (z)

(z  )(cid:21)

f (s(z)) = f (z) ,

(28)

(29)

(30)

where s(z) = e2iz and where  and w are innitesimals.

a function that transforms in this way was found in references [6] and [7] in the context of

string theory. it is given by

f (z) =

w
w

(z  ) (ln(z  )) ,

(31)

where the function (t) is given by

the function (t) is weierstrass  function,

p2(cid:19) ,

where p is the semi-period of the function and is given by p = nw1 + mw2, (n, m  z), where

the weierstrass  function transforms in the following way:

w1 = ln w , w2 = 2i .

(t + w1) = (t) + 2(w1/2) ,
(t + w2) = (t) + 2(w2/2) ,

and the term ln(z  ) transforms like

ln (t (z)  ) = ln w + ln(z  ) ,

so that we have

ln(cid:16)e2iz  e2i(cid:17) = ln(2i) + ln(z  ) ,
f (t (z)) = t (z)(cid:20)f (z) 

(z  )(cid:21) .

w
w

(32)

the function (t) can be related to the theta function [3] in the following way:

(t) =

d
dt

ln (t,  ) ,

where (t,  ) has periods w1 = ln w and w2 = 2i.

if we take the third derivative of the function f (z), we obtain

g(z) = f (z) =

w
w

1

(z  )2 (cid:20)p(t) +

(i)

i

 p (t)(cid:21) ,

where t = ln(z  ) and p(t) is weierstrass p function with periods w1 = ln w and w2 = 2i,
given by

p(t) = 

(t)

d
dt

which transforms like

i.e. it is an elliptic function.

p(t + w1) = p(t + w2) = p(t) ,

since p(t) and its derivatives do not change under a transformation of t + ln w or t + 2i, we

then have

g (t (z)) =

1

w2 g(z) = (cid:2)t (z)(cid:3)2 g(z) ,

i.e. g(z) is an automorphic form with weight 2, as expected from the relation (7). so we have
veried that f (z) is an eichler integral.

9

4.1 example 5

we shall now search for a function with transformation properties similar to those of (28), but now
for the case of many projective transformations. we want a function that transforms like

fw (ta(z)) = t 

a(z)fw(z) 

ta(z)

wa

wa



,

(33)

where

ta(z) =

a(z  a)  waa(z  a)

(z  a)  wa(z  a)

,

for every a = 1, . . . , g, i.e. the action of ta(z) on this function causes innitesimal changes in the
multipliers wa. so this function must transform like

fw (ta(z)) = t 

a(z)(cid:20)fw(z) +

(z  a)(z  a)

wa(a  a)

wa

 (cid:21) .

in addition to this, we also demand that

fa (sa(z)) = fa(z) ,

(34)

(35)

where z  sa(z) is the transformation that takes z once around the aa loop for a = 1, . . . , g.

in order to nd the eichler integral that transforms like this, we shall make analogies between
the function in one loop and the function that we must have for the multiloop case. first we notice
that the series pw(z) dened in (1),

transforms like

pw(z) = xb

(z  b)(z  b)

wb(b  b)

wb


,

pw (ta(z)) = t 

a(z)pw(z) ,

so that it is the generalization for the multiloop case of the polynomial (z  ) for the one loop
case.

now we must try to nd an analog of the weierstrass  function suitable to the multiloop case.
this can be obtained by rst generalizing the concept of a  function and of the weierstrass 
function. this function is given by the hyperelliptic  function [8] [9] or best, by the  function
dened in the appendix. in our rst attempt we attach a b(v) function to every element of the
series pw(z), so that we have

f1w(z) = xb

wb


(z  b)(z  b)

wb(b  b)

b(v) .

this function will not transform the way we want, since the term (z  b)(z  b)/(b  b) and the
rst abelian integrals vb(z) do not transform in the same way. we then go to the next step, which
is making  a function not of the rst abelian integrals vb(z), but of the variables ub(z) (such a
change of variables is justied in baker [8], section 192), such that

ub(z) = ln(cid:18) z  b

z  b(cid:19)  ln(cid:18) a

a(cid:19) .

10

under a change z  ta(z), these variables will change like

ub (ta(z)) =

ta(z)  b
ta(z)  b

=

(a  waa  b + wab)

(a  waa  b + wab) hz  (aawaaaba+bwaa)
hz  (aawaaaba+bwaa)

(awaab+wab)

(awaab+wab)

.

i
i

performing the same change of variables as in (2)-(4), we then obtain

where the coecient wca is given by

ta(z)  b
ta(z)  b

= wca

z  c
z  c

,

so that

wca =

(1  wa)c  (a  waa)
(1  wa)c  (a  waa)

,

ub (ta(z)) = ln wca + uc(z) .

we then redene the generalized  function (v) in the following way:

(u) =



xn=

g

exp 
xc,d=1


this function transforms like

(nc + c)

1
2

ln wcd(nd + d) +

g

xc=1

2ic(nc + c) +

g

xc=1

uc(nc + c)


.

(u + ) = exp (

g

xc=1

pc(cid:18)uc +

1
2

c(cid:19) 

g

xc=1

[ipcqc  2i(qcc  pcc)]) (u) ,

where b is now given by

b =

g

xc=1

(2ibcpc + ln wbcqc) = 2ipb +

g

xc=1

ln wbcqc .

dening now

we have

and

b(u) =


ub

ln (u) ,

b (u (ta(z))) = b(u)  ab

b (u (sa(z))) = b(u) .

we then dene the following function:

f (z) = xb

wb


(z  b)(z  b)

wb(b  b)

b (u(z)) .

this function transforms like

(36)

(37)

fw (ta(z)) = t 

wc


(z  c)(z  c)

wc(c  c)

a(z)xc
a(z)"xc

wc


= t 

(cid:2)c (u(z))  ac(cid:3)

c (u(z)) 

wa



(z  a)(z  a)

wa(a  a) #

(z  c)(z  c)

wc(c  c)

11

and

fw (sa(z)) = fw(z) .

since we are summing over all the elements of the schottky group, we then have

fw (ta(z)) = t 

fw (sa(z)) = fw(z) ,

a(z)(cid:20)fw(z) 

wa

(z  a)(z  a)



wa(a  a)

(cid:21) ,

which are the transformation properties we wanted. so we have obtained the eichler integral that
has the eect of changing innitesimally the variables wa of a riemann surface of genus g.

one way to verify this is a true eichler integral is to take its third derivative. the result must

be an automorphic form of weight 2. taking the third derivative of (37), we have

gw(z) 

d3

dz3 fw(z) = xb

wb

wb (cid:20)

(b  b)

(z  b)(z  b)(cid:21)2

(cid:2) pbc (u(z))  p  (u(z))(cid:3) ,

(38)

where

is the hyperelliptic p function and

pbc(u) = 


uc

b(u)

p 

bc(u) =

2
u2
c

pbc(ub) .

it can be easily veried that pbc(u) and its derivatives are invariant under changes z  ta(z)

and z  sa(z), so that the function g(z) transforms like

i.e. it is an automorphic form of weight 2. this conrms fw(z) as an eichler integral.

gw (ta(z)) = (cid:0)t 

a(z)(cid:1)2 gw(z) ,

(39)

4.2 example 6

in the same way we found a function (eichler integral) that changes the variables wa of a rie-
mann surface innitesimally we now want to nd a function that will change the variables a
innitesimally. this means this function must transform like

f (ta(z)) = t 

a(z)f(z) 

ta(z)

a

a


,

for every a = 1, . . . , g, what implies that we want this function to transform like

f (ta(z)) = t 

a(z)(cid:20)f(z) +

(1  wa)

wa(a  a)2 (z  a)2 a

 (cid:21) .

(40)

we also demand that

f (sa(z)) = f(z) .

the method to obtain this function is analogous to the one used in the example 5, but now we use,
instead of the poincare series pw(z), the series given in (5):

p(z) = xb

b


(1  wb)
wb(b  b)2 (z  b)2 .

12

the function (eichler integral) with the properties we need is then given by

f(z) = xb

b


(1  wb)
wb(b  b)2 (z  b)2 b(u) .

(41)

4.3 example 7

similarly, if want a function that changes the variables a innitesimally, we then need it to
transform like

f (ta(z)) = t 

a(z)f(z) 

for every a = 1, . . . , g, i.e.

a


,

ta(z)

a

f (ta(z)) = t 

a(z)(cid:20)f(z) +

(1  wa)

wa(a  a)2 (z  a)2 a

 (cid:21) .

we also demand that

we then use the poincare series (6),

f (sa(z)) = f(z) .

p(z) = xb

b


(1  wb)
wb(b  b)2 (z  b)2 ,

and build the eichler integral

f(z) = xb

b


(1  wb)
wb(b  b)2 (z  b)2 b(u) ,

which has the correct transformation properties.

a some geometrical objects dened on a genus g riemann surface

a.1 generalized  functions

the generalized  function is dened in the following way [8]:

(v; , ) =



xn=
xa=1

+

g

va(2)abvb + i(na + a)ab(nb + b)(cid:21)

g

xa,b=1(cid:20) 1

exp

[va(na + a) + 2ia(na + a)]) ,

2i

13

where the sum p

n= means the sum over all na, a = 1, . . . , g. here, va and vb are the g rst
abelian integrals, (2)ab is a symmetric g  g matrix, na and nb are integers and a and a are
vectors with g components that are the characteristics of the function.

if all the lements in the rows p and q are integers, this function transforms like [8]

(v + ; , ) = exp( g

xa=1(cid:20)ha(cid:18)va +

1
2

a(cid:19)  ipaqa + 2i(qaa  paa)(cid:21)) (v; , )

where v +  stands for the sums va + a (a = 1, . . . , g) where

and

a = 2i

g

xb=1h2(1)abpb + 2(2)abqbi

ha =

g

xb=1h2(1)abpb + 2(2)abqb)i

where (1) and (2) are g  g matrices and p, q are g-vectors.

we can x (2)ab = 0. thsi implies

we then have the following function:

(1)ab = 

1
2

ab .

(v; , ) =



xn=

which transforms like

g

xa,b=1

exp


i(na + a)ab(nb + b) +

g

xa=1

[va(na + a) + 2ia(na + a)]

a(cid:19)  ipaqa + 2i(qaa  paa)(cid:21)) (v; , ) .

,

(v + ; , ) = exp( g

xa=1(cid:20)ha(cid:18)va +

this is the function that is generally reered to as the generalized  function in the literature.

we may dene the well-known object called the prime form in terms of the generalized 

function, which is its most general denition. it is given by

where

e(z, ) =  (v(z)  v())" g
xa=1
(v)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)v=0

b(0)wb(z)#1/2
a(0)wa(z)#1/2" g
xb=1
(v)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)v=0

, b(0) 

a(0) 


va


vb

,

and wa(v), wb(v) are rst abelian dierentials.

a.2 hyperelliptic  function

we now dene the hyperelliptic -function [8] [9]:

this function transforms in the following way:

a(v) =


va

ln (v; , ) .

a(v + ) = ha + a(v) =

g

xb=1h2(1)abpb + 2(2)abqbi + a(v) .

the analogy with the one loop -functions is complete when we associate the matrices (1) and (2)
with the numbers (w1/2) and (w2/2), respectively. we then have the identity

g

xc=1

2iac(2)cb  2i(1)ab = ab .

a function that will be more useful to us is one that is invariant under a change  = 2iqa so

that we must x (2)ab = 0. such a function, say a, is dened by

and transforms like

a(v) =


va

ln (v; , )

a(v + ) = pa + a(v) .

more particularly, this formula shows that the function  is invariant under a change a = 2iabpb
for b 6= a.
it only changes, and then only by a constant term, under the transformation a =
2iaapa for any pa.

a.3 hyperelliptic p function

we now dene the hyperelliptic p function in the following way [8] [9]:

pab =


vb

a(v) =


vb


va

ln (v) .

this function is invariant under changes a = 2ipg

pab(v + ) = pab .

b=1 ab + 2iqa, i.e.
