abstract

the thermal dynamics of d-branes and of open superstrings in background gauge
elds is studied. it is shown that d-brane dynamics forbids constant velocity motion
at nite temperature. t-duality is used to interpret this feature as a consequence
of the absence of an equilibrium state of charged strings at nite temperature in a
constant background electric eld, as a result of debye screening of electric elds.
the eective action for the polyakov loop operator is computed and the correspond-
ing screening solutions are described. the nite temperature theory is also used to
illustrate the importance of carefully incorporating wuyang terms into the string
path integral for compact target spaces.

1 introduction and summary

one of the fundamental problems in superstring theory is to understand the behaviour
of strings in external elds. it is relevant to question about the existence and nature of
possible non-perturbative vacuum states. using duality, it is also important for under-
standing various aspects of d-brane dynamics. an example of an external eld problem
which has been studied extensively is that with a constant electromagnetic eld [1][6].
gauge elds couple to charges which live at the endpoints of open strings, and the mod-
ication of the vacuum energy by a slowly varying gauge eld is known to be described
by the borninfeld action [1]

(1.1)

where the factor of inverse string coupling comes from the fact that this is a tree level (disc)
amplitude. here and in the following . . . will denote higher order terms in the (covariant)
derivative expansion of the external elds. there are corrections to the eective action
(1.1) at the one-loop (annulus diagram) and higher loop orders. by t-duality, the born
infeld action gives the eective dynamics of d-branes [7] and is very useful in determining
the couplings of degrees of freedom in the d-brane to string theory as well as supergravity
degrees of freedom. in this paper we will study the eective action for gauge elds in
a thermal state of superstring theory. we will be particularly interested in how the
borninfeld action (1.1) is modied by temperature and what this modication implies
about electric elds. we shall compute the leading temperature corrections to (1.1) for
weakly-coupled strings and slowly-varying external elds.

in the path integral approach to nite temperature superstring theory, the spacetime
is taken as ten dimensional euclidean space with time x0 compactied on a circle of
circumference  = 1/kbt , where kb is boltzmanns constant and t is the temperature.
then, euclidean external gauge elds must be periodic in x0,

a(x0, ~x) = a(x0 + , ~x)

(1.2)

in this case, it is impossible to x a gauge where a0 = 0. on the other hand, it is
possible to x a gauge where a0 is independent of the euclidean time x0 and is diagonal,
(a0)bc(x0, ~x) = a(~x)b bc. we will consider the special case where the external gauge eld
is in an abelian u(1) subgroup of the full non-abelian chanpaton gauge group, and set
all spatial components of the gauge elds to 0. the generator of the abelian subgroup is
characterized by the eigenvalues eb which are interpreted as u(1) charges and

the disc amplitude (1.1) is unmodied at nite temperature, because the disc world-
sheet cannot wrap the cylindrical target space and thus cannot distinguish between a
compactied and an un-compactied spacetime. the rst corrections due to tempera-
ture appear in the annulus amplitude. we shall nd that the free energy is given by the
functional

and  denote the standard jacobi theta-functions.

the dependence of the eective potential on the temporal component of the gauge
eld is familiar from nite temperature gauge theory.
in particular, it implies debye
screening of electric elds. consider the linearized equation for the minima of the free
energy, which after rescaling can be written in the form
 ~2a(~x) + 2a(~x) = 0

(1.6)

this equation has exponentially decaying solutions a(~x)  e |~x| where, at low tempera-
tures (kbt  1), the debye screening mass  is given by

it is clear for this reason that constant electric elds cannot be extrema of the eective
action. another way to see that the existence of constant electric elds is incompatible
with the existence of a debye mass is the following. if we try to make a constant abelian
electric eld by choosing the background gauge eld
a(~x) = ~e  ~x

(1.8)

then the integral over ~x that one would have to do in computing the temperature correc-
tions to the free energy would vanish because of the property

z d9x 2 



~e  ~x(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

i2

22t! = 0

(1.9)

which is a consequence of supersymmetry. this property can be interpreted as a result
of debye screening, i.e. that the nite temperature string theory forbids constant electric
elds. all states except the ground state contain excitations of charged particles and
therefore have innite energy. in fact, because of the schwinger mechanism [5], even the
ground state is unstable.

3

in the following sections we will demonstrate this result directly using the boundary
state formalism. two dierent gauges are commonly used to study constant electric elds,
the static gauge, (a0, ~a) = ( ~e~x, 0), and the temporal gauge, (a0, ~a) = (0, ~ex0). in the
temporal gauge, the gauge potential is not periodic in euclidean time, but it is periodic
up to a gauge transformation,

~a(x0 + , ~x) = ~a(x0, ~x) + ~(cid:16) ~e  ~x(cid:17)

(1.10)

in this case, it is necessary to augment the usual coupling of the edge of a charged open

string to the gauge eld by adding a wuyang term [8], h a dx  h a dx + , in

order to compensate the gauge transformation (1.10). the geometrical reasoning for
adding this term is explained in appendix a. in the next section we shall use the example
of a relativistic charged particle to illustrate how the wuyang term is essential if the
partition function is to be independent of the gauge choice. one byproduct of the following
analysis will therefore be the importance of incorporating such terms into the superstring
path integral for generic target space compactications involving external elds.

under t-duality, external gauge elds map onto the trajectories of d-branes, whose
long wavelength dynamics are described by supergravity. thermal states of d-branes are
of interest as non-bps states of superstring theory. in the supergravity picture, they have
a natural hawking temperature and radiation which can be interpreted as the emission
of closed string modes by a non-extremal d-brane conguration. it has been suggested
[9] that the gravitational hawking temperature and the temperature of a boltzmann gas
of d-branes should be identied. it is therefore natural to study the thermodynamics of
d-branes and to understand the special aspects of d-brane dynamics which arise when
they are in a thermal state. it has been shown [10] that the eective action for a gas
of d0-branes which is obtained by summing over physical (gso projected) superstring
states is



se[~x] =

z0

d ( 1

e 2|~x|/2

+ . . .)

(1.11)

the rst term, which is the relativistic free particle lagrangian for the d0-branes, follows
from the borninfeld action (1.1) and t-duality. it is correct up to higher derivatives of
the relative position vector ~x( ) with respect to the euclidean time  . the second term,
which we have given the low temperature limit of, comes from the annulus amplitude and
is valid only for static branes. corrections to the annulus amplitude at nite temperature
which take into account the time dependence of ~x are not known.

unlike at zero temperature, where the system of static d0-branes is a bps state and
this potential would vanish due to supersymmetry, temperature breaks supersymmetry
and leaves the residual short-ranged attractive interaction. the potential in eq. (1.11) was
obtained from the superstring annulus free energy with dirichlet boundary conditions [11]

and incorporating the dynamics of the time component of the gauge eld a0( ) on the
d-particle worldline. on the other hand, at zero temperature the motion of an assembly
of d0-branes at constant relative velocity ~v = ~x also breaks supersymmetry. the leading
velocity dependent gravitational attraction between a pair of d0-branes in ten dimensional
supergravity is proportional to ~v 4/|~x|7 [7, 12]. the exact one-loop potential at zero
temperature is again given by the annulus amplitude which in this case is [7, 13, 14]

d-branes.
only on worldsheet derivatives of a string embedding coordinate.
it then proceeds by
replacing axi by iabbxi and the resulting replacement of neumann boundary conditions
for xi with dirichlet conditions. we are interested in examining the t-dual of the string
in a constant electric eld ~e. this should produce an open string whose endpoints are
constrained by dirichlet boundary conditions to end on a d-brane which is moving with
a constant velocity ~v = 2e ~e [7]. indeed, in the temporal gauge, the coupling of the

constant electric eld exp ieh ~ex0  t~x is replaced by the vertex operator for a moving d-
brane exp eh ~ex0 n~x [15], where t and n are the derivatives tangential and normal to

the boundary of the string worldsheet, respectively. however, we shall nd that, at nite
temperature, both of these couplings must be augmented by a wuyang term which
breaks the translation invariance in the direction of the electric eld ~e. the t-dual
of the wuyang term can be obtained in principle, but it is a complicated, non-local
expression. we shall nd, however, that it has a simple presentation within the boundary
state formalism. once it is taken into account, we can show that, just as debye screening
forbids constant electric elds in open superstring theory, it also forbids the constant
motion of d-branes. this implies that there is a damping of their motion analogous to
debye screening.

2 thermodynamic partition function in a constant

electric field

2.1 relativistic particle

to illustrate the general ideas, it is instructive to begin with the case of a relativistic
charged scalar particle in a constant electric eld at nite temperature. the extension

5

to strings will be straightforward and the nal result can be represented as a sum over
particles with masses given by the open string spectrum and appropriate degeneracies.
the diagonal elements of the (unnormalized) thermal density matrix are given by the
euclidean path integral

(2.1)

where [x(t)] is the abelian phase factor in the given electromagnetic background. the
temperature t = 1/kb enters via the boundary conditions

x0(s) = x0(0) + n (integer n),
~x(s) = ~x(0) = ~y,

(2.2)

which compacties the euclidean time coordinate x0 on a circle of circumference . the
parameter s plays the role of the proper time during which the particle propagates along
the given trajectory x(t) that can wind n times around the space-time cylinder, while m
is the particle mass. the path integral (2.1) is to be summed over all winding numbers
n  z.

the constant electric eld can be described in the static gauge by the vector potential

a0(x) =

2
  ~f  ~x,

~a(x) = ~0 ,

(2.3)

where we have denoted the temporal component f0i of the euclidean eld strength
tensor by ~f  fi(i = 1, . . . , d 1). it is related to the electric eld ~e in minkowski space
by
(2.4)

~f = i ~e.

the constant  in eq. (2.3) can always be taken to lie in the interval [0, 1) due to the
periodicity of x0.
it plays a crucial role at nite temperature as we will discuss, but
for now  is simply associated with choosing a reference point where the potential a0
vanishes. since a is single valued for the gauge choice (2.3), the phase factor is simply

[x(t)]  exp i

note that one can choose a more general gauge

a0(x) =

2
  (1  c) ~f  ~x,

~a(x) = c ~f x0,

(2.6)

6

so that (2.3) corresponds to the choice c = 0. for this choice, ~a is multivalued due to the
boundary condition (2.2) so that the wuyang term [8] has to be included in the phase
factor which now takes the form

[x(t)]

(2.7)

this formula is derived in appendix a. integrating by parts, it is easy to see that (2.5)
and (2.7) coincide as they should due to gauge invariance.

substituting (2.5) in eq. (2.1), we get a gaussian path integral of the form of that for
the harmonic oscillator [16]. it is convenient to choose coordinates where ~f = (f, 0, . . . , 0).
the result then reads

and d is the dimension of space-time. eq. (2.8) is similar to the density matrix for (spinor)
quantum electrodynamics at nite temperature in the presence of a constant background
electric eld [17]. the path integral derivation of it is sketched in appendix b.

the formula (2.8) resembles the density matrix for a harmonic oscillator of frequency
f . this feature can be easily understood in second quantization, where the eigenvalues
of the operator i0 which enters the kleingordon operator are given by the matsubara
frequencies 2m/, which results at each level m in the hamiltonian

(2.11)

(2.12)

we get eq. (2.8).

the dependence on ~y in eq. (2.8) implies the violation of translational invariance of
the theory. its appearance is most easily understood in the temporal gauge (given by (2.6)
with c = 1) where only ~a depends on x. the term  ~f  ~y/2 in the rst argument of
the theta function in (2.8) comes in this gauge entirely from the wuyang term

 n ~f  ~x(0) = n ~f  ~y ,

(2.13)

which was added to the exponent of the phase factor  to guarantee global gauge invari-
ance.

if we were instead to choose a vector potential which is a periodic function of t = x0,
then the gauge eld would be single-valued and no wuyang term would be required.
the simplest example is a eld ~a(t) which is a linear function of t for 0  t <  and then
returns to its initial value ~a(0) at t = ,

where  is the step function. the thermal density matrix is then translationally invariant:

~aper(t) = ~f t(cid:16)1  (t  )(cid:17),

(2.15)

3 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

the choice of periodic vector potential (2.14) diers from what is considered above for a
constant electric eld since

~aper(t) = ~f  ~f  (t  ).

(2.16)

the lesson to be learned from this example is that the thermal partition function in a
constant electric eld is trivial since the integration of eq. (2.8) over ~y picks up only the
term of winding number n = 0 and the temperature dependence disappears. there are no
excited states in the external eld and only the ground state exists as a stable conguration
of the charged particle. this feature occurs because there is no globally dened periodic
vector potential ~a(x0) in this case as is required by the standard formulation. only in
time-dependent backgrounds, such as eq. (2.14) which involves a time-localized point
source of electric eld, does there exist excited congurations of the system.
in this
latter case, the imaginary part of eq. (2.15) at the poles of the contour integration, i.e.
at f s = 2i (integer ), yields the standard (zero temperature) schwinger probability
amplitude for the creation of charged particle pairs in scalar quantum electrodynamics.
note that there is a big dierence between constant electric and magnetic elds, because
in the latter case the eld strength tensor does not have a component in the compactied
direction and the magnetic eld would enter only in the pre-exponential factors of the
thermal density matrix, while the argument of the theta function would be the same as
without the eld.

2.2 strings

consider an open superstring with independent u(1) charges e1 and e2 at its endpoints in
an electromagnetic background. here, strictly speaking, by an abelian background eld
we mean a eld in an abelian subgroup of the chanpaton gauge group o(32) of type-i
superstring theory. we are interested in the case e1 6= e2. however, unitarity requires the
existence of neutral strings in the spectrum. consider a string scattering amplitude with
the given charges at the endpoints. an amplitude with an even number of external legs
can be sliced in many dierent ways into intermediate states. some of these intermediate
states will consist of open strings with the charge e1 or e2 at both of its endpoints. an
amplitude with an odd number of external legs necessarily involves at least one neutral
string in the scattering process. although these neutral string states will not be relevant
to debye screening or the corresponding t-dual d-brane dynamics, they do contribute to
the total scattering amplitudes which will involve sums of the form

f =

1

2 xe1,e2q

f (e1, e2)

(2.17)

where q is the set of charges in the decomposition of the fundamental representation of
the open superstring chanpaton gauge group under the embedding of u(1) induced by
the background electromagnetic eld.

the open superstring partition function in a constant magnetic eld at nite temper-
ature has been calculated in [6]. we will now show that charged superstrings at nite
temperature forbid constant electric elds. the bosonic sector of this system can be
described in rst quantization by the polyakov path integral

fb(e1, e2) = z dgab z dx e sb[gab,x]

(2.18)

where the action in the conformal gauge and in euclidean spacetime is

sb =

1

4 z

d2z zx zx + ie1 i1

a(x) dx + ie2 i2

a(x) dx

(2.19)

finite temperature only aects the system when the string worldsheet  can wrap the
compact time direction, so the leading string diagram of interest is the annulus1 with local
coordinates z =  e 2i with 0    1 and a    1, where a = e t is the teichmuller
parameter of the annulus. we enforce the periodicity constraint in the euclidean time by
substituting

x0(, ) 7 x0(, ) + n

(2.20)

and then later on summing the path integral over all winding numbers n  z.

1the mobius strip has only a single connected boundary, so that only neutral strings contribute to
the mobius amplitude. as mentioned above, neutral superstrings will not play a signicant role in the
subsequent analysis.

9

we shall choose the periodic gauge eld conguration (2.3). with these choices the

action (2.19) becomes

sb =

d ~f  ~x(a, ) x0(a, ).

(2.21)

there is a zero mode on the annulus given by x = y = const. normally, the action does
not depend on it and integrating it out in the path integral produces a factor vd1, with
vd1 the volume of space. in the present case it contributes to eq. (2.18) the factor

z dd1y e i(e2e1)n ~f~y =  (2)d1 (d1)(cid:16)(e2  e1)n ~f(cid:17).

(2.22)

so unless n = 0 (the zero temperature condition), or  = 0 (the dual of the zero tem-
perature condition), or e1 = e2 (neutral strings), the free energy of the string gas is zero.
thus for charged strings at nite temperature in a constant background electric eld, the
partition function picks up only the  independent n = 0 sector.

this simple calculation exemplies the fact that the translation non-invariance of
the nite temperature string theory produces a non-trivial zero mode integration which
localizes the string gas onto its ground state conguration, unless the strings themselves
are neutral. this is of course anticipated from the example of the relativistic particle
above and the fact that the one-loop string free energy comes from an innite tower
of particle states.
in the following we will argue that this ground state localization is
evidence for debye screening of electric elds and the appearance of a debye mass. we
will then use t-duality to translate this into a statement about d-brane dynamics.

3 debye screening in superstring theory

3.1 boundary state formalism

we will now compute the free energy of charged open superstrings in a constant electric
eld by performing a modular transformation t = 1/s of the annulus amplitude, which
interchanges the roles of  =  ln  and , and working in the closed string channel
with a cylindrical worldsheet, i.e. the boundary state formalism. in this representation,
0    s parametrizes the length of the cylinder so that the boundaries are at  = 0, s,
and 0    1 parametrizes the closed string which propagates through the cylinder
with time coordinate  . the standard eld theoretic proper time is then s = 2s (the
same as for a particle). boundary states are coherent closed string states which insert

10

a boundary on the worldsheet and enforce on it the appropriate boundary conditions.
they are constructed by applying the boltzmann weight operator e sb| =0, constructed
from the action (2.19), to the vacuum state of the closed string hilbert space [2]. finite
temperature only aects the bosonic zero modes, and we therefore consider only these
contributions in detail. the bosonic part of the boundary state which corresponds to one
end of an open superstring is created in part by the wilson loop operator

[x(, )] = exp ie

where e is the charge of the open string endpoint and (x) is the appropriate wuyang

angle e dened by

(3.2)

we shall choose coordinates in which ~f = (f, 0, . . . , 0) and the gauge (2.6) with c = 1.
then the wuyang term is

(x) = f x1( = 0)hx0( = 1)  x0( = 0)i

(3.3)

to see what eects nite temperature imposes on the boundary states, we consider
(3.1) as an operator on the closed string hilbert space. the closed string mode expansions
are

and it is straightforward to see that the oscillator part of (3.5) cancels the extra boundary
integration in (3.1) which comes from the winding number term in the mode expansion of
x0 in eq. (3.4). the total oscillator contribution to the action is therefore the standard one
for open strings in constant background electric elds. this simple calculation illustrates

11

the importance of incorporating the wuyang term in compactications involving external
elds.

in the bosonic sector, the boundary state |b, ei is required to satisfy the rotated

boundary conditions which follow from varying the worldsheet action (2.19) [2, 5],

at t = 0. the fermionic boundary coupling in the worldsheet superstring action is

unaected by nite temperature, and it is given by a similar rotation as in eq. (3.12)

on the fermionic oscillators and on the ramond zero-mode states (see [2, 14, 20] for the
explicit expressions). however, nite temperature breaks supersymmetry and modies the
gso projection operator due to the winding numbers w0 around the compact temporal
direction [21]. this means that the sum over worldsheet spin structures contains an extra
weighting (1)w0 for the (, +) spin structure in the neveu-schwarz sector.

a factor of 1(0|it)4 in eq. (3.15) comes from the bosonic oscillator modes in the eight
directions transverse to the 01 plane, and a factor 1(0|it) comes from the ghosts while
the rotated light-like degrees of freedom contribute 1(|it). these latter two contri-
butions cancel each other in the neutral string limit e1 = e2 or in the absence of the
electric eld. the sum of theta functions in the last line of eq. (3.15) similarly comes
from the fermionic oscillators with the rst two representing the contributions from the
neveu-schwarz spin structures and the last one the ramond sector component. the delta
function comes from the overlap hk1

1i after using the orthogonality condition (3.10).

we see once again that the free energy of charged superstrings is independent of
temperature. the triviality in the present case arises because the operator (3.6) translates
the momentum k1 in the boundary states (3.9) by the dual momentum in the temporal
direction. in the case of neutral superstrings, whereby e1 = e2 = e and  = 0, we may use
the jacobi abstruse identity

and the series expansion

eq. (3.21) coincides with the standard expression for the partition function of the neutral

the fact that for a given set of charges e1, e2 the spectrum must contain neutral strings
(c.f. eq. (2.17)), we arrive at the total one-loop annulus amplitude in the closed string

3.2 eective action for the polyakov loop

one can readily see from eq. (3.15) the correlation between the dependence of the correla-
tor of polyakov loops on the temporal gauge eld component a0 and the vanishing of the
electric eld. for a charged string at nite temperature, in order for the rst exponential
in eq. (3.15) to depend on a0, the delta function must force f = 0. taking this zero eld
limit, we can use eq. (3.15) to see the occurrence of debye screening from the fact that
there is a non-trivial eective action for the polyakov loop operator. instead of eq. (3.1),
we will consider a more general condensate of photon vertices dened by the path ordered
polyakov loop operator

p[a] = y

tr p exp i i

a(x) dx

(3.25)

associated with the open superstring chanpaton gauge group. the boundary of the

string worldsheet is in general a set of disconnected closed loops,  = s . the

screening of electric elds owes to special properties of the nite temperature theory. as
all observables must be periodic in x0, at least up to a gauge transformation, the temporal
gauge eld a0(x) has a special status, since not all gauge transformations are allowed.
the gauge transformations u which are allowed are those for which u is periodic up to
an element of the center of the gauge group,

u(x0 + , ~x) = e i u(x0, ~x)

(3.26)

this symmetry is a result of the fact that all string states transform in either the adjoint
or other zero n-ality representations of the chanpaton gauge group.3 related to this

3note that  =  for type-i superstrings, but later on we shall consider analogous statements for

d-branes in which the gauge group will be u (n ) for some n and  is arbitrary.

15

symmetry is the fact that screening occurs only for elds in the su(n) subalgebra of u(n)

where pb(a0)bb = 0 mod n. the true gauge group is not u(n) but rather the quotient

of u(n) by its center, or u(n)/u(1) = su(n)/zn .

this feature results in two facts. first of all, we can always choose a gauge where a0
is time-independent and diagonal. however, at nite temperature one cannot completely
remove the a0s by the residual abelian gauge invariance because of the existence of the
non-trivial gauge invariant holonomy (3.25). secondly, there is a global symmetry under
the simultaneous translation of all diagonal elements of a0,

aaa
0 (~x)  aaa

0 (~x) + 

(3.27)

this global symmetry can be restricted to the zn subgroup of u(1) where  = 2n/
(integer n). it is a result of the existence of large gauge transformations,

a  u (a  i) u1

(3.28)

where u = e 2inx0eb/ and eb is the matrix whose only non-vanishing entry is (eb)bb = 1.
this gauge transform is periodic in x0 and under which

a0  a0 +

2n



eb

(3.29)

the eective potential should exhibit this invariance. in a static diagonal gauge where
the worldsheet boundary wraps the periodic time direction, the polyakov loop operator

is given by p = pb e iab(x). then f (x)  1 lnhp(x)i is the free energy that would

be required to introduce a heavy fundamental representation quark into the system and
thereby gives information about connement.

for example, via a gauge transformation we can consider the background eld

abc

0 (x) = bc ab
0

(3.30)

where ab
0 are constants. when the worldsheet  is an annulus, the eective action is a sum
over the dierences between all abelian u(1)n charges ab
0 located at the two boundaries
of . this is easily incorporated into the boundary state formalism described above, and
from eq. (3.15) we nd that the eective potential for the polyakov loop operator is given
by

the rst term in eq. (3.36) comes from the lowest lying n = 0 states which have degen-

3.3 some properties of the eective action

the coecient of the expansion of eq. (3.34) or eq. (3.36) to order a2
0 yields an expression
for the debye screening mass 2/2. the leading contribution is given in eq. (1.7) and
it is the same as the debye mass that one would calculate in ordinary ten-dimensional
yang-mills theory. this is due to the fact that the dominant term in eq. (3.36) at low
temperatures comes from only the particle-like excitations of the strings. the leading
stringy corrections are exponentially suppressed by factors e /. in the low temper-
ature regime these corrections play no role in the debye screening. this exponential
suppression is a result of supersymmetry which leads to cancellation of the leading order
stringy corrections to the mass . it is interesting that stringy eects only play a role at
temperatures near the hagedorn transition. notice also that 2  t /th(0), so that well
below the critical temperature the debye mass is small and the electric elds become more
and more long-ranged. this suggests that there should exist gauge eld congurations
with a relatively mild time dependence for which there is no screening of the (time
dependent) electric elds (such as the example given at the end of section 2.1).

the functional [a] above is the leading term in the derivative expansion of the full
eective potential for the gauge eld a(x)b = eb a(x). as discussed in section 1, it should

17

be added to the tree-level borninfeld lagrangian for the eld a0(~x), thereby determining
the one-loop, temperature corrections to the gauge eld eective action of the superstring
theory. the solutions of the resulting equations of motion then determine the allowed,
on-shell gauge eld congurations which lead to a conformally-invariant theory at nite
temperature. at low temperatures, the modied borninfeld action is given by the free
energy

(3.37)
we can think of the modied borninfeld action (3.37) as a generalization of the sine-
gordon theory representation of the classical coulomb gas where the standard kinetic
term (~a)2 is replaced by the borninfeld lagrangian. the sine-gordon theory has
well-known soliton solutions, which correspond to solitary waves of the plasma phase of
the coulomb gas.
it is interesting to note that the borninfeld generalization of the
coulomb gas (3.37) also has solitons. consider the ansatz where a(x) depends on only
one space coordinate. then the non-linear equation for the extrema of (3.37) is solved by
the function a(x) which is obtained from the integral

4 t-duality and moving d-branes

the boundary state formalism of the previous section presents the most ecient way to
map the results for the electric eld problem into statements about d-brane dynamics at
nite temperature. string theory in background gauge elds is related by t-duality to
open string theory with moving d-branes. the prerequisite for this relation is translation
invariance of the external elds in the directions which will be compactied. this means
that the gauge elds should be translationally invariant up to a gauge transformation.
generally this is hard to do in rst quantization because the required wuyang terms spoil
the translation invariance. but, as we now demonstrate, the boundary state formalism
gives a precise prescription for obtaining the t-dual d-brane picture.

for this, we compactify the neumann string coordinates xi  xi

n for i = 1, . . . , dp1
on circles of circumferences li. this modies the closed string mode expansions (3.4)
along the rst d  p  1 spatial directions to

where n1 is the kaluzaklein index and w1 the winding number around the compactied
direction along which the electric eld lies. the wuyang term in this case is given in
appendix a and, for the gauge choice of section 3.1, it coincides with eq. (3.5). the zero
mode contribution to the wilson line integral in eq. (3.1) at  = 0 is modied to

 i sw0,w1 = 2iew0 

ief

(4.2)

which now contains the rotation generator on the spacetime torus (again parametrized by
dual momenta). the oscillator contributions are again unchanged, and in the boundary
states (3.8) the zero mode momentum states in eq. (3.9) are now also discretized in the

rst dp1 spatial directions. upon applying the zero mode operator e i sw0,w1 to the fock

vacuum, which shifts the total light-like momentum, we nd that the only modication
to the boundary state is again in the bosonic zero mode part which now becomes

the shifts in the kaluzaklein integers in eq. (4.3) imply that the electric eld must be

where n is an integer. the constraint (4.4) is derived in appendix a from a purely math-
ematical point of view and is shown to be a topological quantization condition associated
with the presence of the wuyang term.

now we apply a t-duality transformation along the compact spatial directions and
write down the corresponding boundary state for a moving dp-brane. this mapping
interchanges the neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions for the open string along
the rst d  p  1 spatial directions. the new string coordinates xj

(4.8)

is the velocity of the string endpoint in the direction 1 transverse to the d-brane. the
constraint (4.8) can be thought of as momentum quantization along the compact boost
direction, with the quantum of velocity equal to the speed in going once around the dual
circle in a single unit of matsubara time. the dirichlet boundary conditions in eq. (4.7)
may be alternatively expressed by setting the operators equal to xed positions yi
0 at  = 0
which we interpret as the transverse coordinates of the dp-brane. note that the angle
e dened in eq. (3.2) is interpreted in the dual picture as the euclidean rapidity of the
d-brane motion, so that the twist parameter (3.17) becomes the relativistic composition
of the velocities of two branes [7].

the boundary conditions (4.7) are solved by acting on fock vacua with the dual version

(4.11)

n 7 a1

which in the closed string parametrization at  = 0 is obtained from eq. (3.5) by reect-
ing the left-moving oscillators a1
n. for the case of d-brane motion, the wuyang
term (4.11) is associated with maintaining reparametrization invariance of the d-brane
worldvolume along the boosted direction at nite temperature. its eect when the oper-
ator (4.9) is written in terms of closed string mode expansions is identical to that of the
electric eld problem. note that o-shell the eld (4.11) has a very complicated, non-local
form. it is this feature which makes a path integral calculation technically problematic,
in contrast to the boundary state formalism which uses on-shell string embedding elds.

upon decompactifying the dual circles in every spatial direction but the boosted one,

we arrive at the dp-brane boundary state [14, 19, 20]

cos e |dpx, y0; vi(0) exp o(e)|0ia|0ia |bghi |b,ei (4.12)

20

cose inserts the appropriate lorentz contraction factor. the operator o(e) is obtained
from eq. (3.12) by changing the sign of ai
n for i = 1, . . . , dp1. the ghost and fermionic
boundary states are identical to those used in section 3.1, while the bosonic zero mode
part of the boundary state is now

|dpx, y0; vi(0) =

(4.13)
where n1 = w1 is the dual momentum and w1 = n1 the dual winding number around the
compact boost direction. as before the closed string zero-mode operator (4.2) accounts
for the boosted boundary conditions in the light-like plane, while the transverse dirichlet
boundary conditions in eq. (4.7) are enforced by the delta-function operators in eq. (4.13)
which are dened by the fourier expansions

(4.14)

these delta-functions have the eect of introducing extra terms, proportional to |~y|2, into
the energy levels coming from the masses of the open string excitations which stretch
between a pair of branes at separation |~y|. the compactness of the boost direction is
required since the operator (4.9) shifts the temporal kaluzaklein momentum n0 by
vq1/2, which is only an integer when the momentum q1 is discretized and the velocity
is quantized according to eq. (4.8). likewise, the operator e i sw0,n1 shifts the kaluza
klein momentum n1 along the boost direction by l1vw0/ , which with the topological
quantization condition (4.8) is an integer only for w0 = 0. the dirichlet zero mode
boundary states are thus

(4.15)

it is important to realize that the form (4.15) for the boundary state is only valid
at nite temperature and velocity. for a static dp-brane the boost direction can be
decompactied and the boundary state is instead given from eq. (4.13) as

|dpx, y0; v = 0i(0) =

(4.16)
which produces a non-trivial winding mode dependence in the temperature direction. if
we had used instead of eq. (4.8) the dual quantization condition v = n / l1, n  z,

21

in eq. (4.13), then the kaluzaklein momenta of the boundary states would be n0 = 0
and n1 = w0v l1/  while their winding numbers would be arbitrary. this state would
then coincide with eq. (4.16) in the zero velocity limit. however, as shown in appendix
a, eq. (4.8) has a deep mathematical origin and is the correct one to use for the present
problem.
it arises from the mathematical property that the light-like torus has non-
trivial cech cohomology which makes it impossible to dene a globally non-singular vector
potential on it with non-vanishing ux. we see then that the zero mode boundary state
(4.15) is the appropriate t-dual of eq. (3.9) which contains as well a sort of temperature
duality transformation, in the sense that the boosted boundary conditions forbid closed
string windings around the temporal direction but now the closed string energies are
non-vanishing.

we see that from the onset the dp-brane boundary state represents only the trivial
w0 = 0 state at nite temperature. this property may be attributed to the fact that the
closed string operator which is used to boost a static d-brane boundary state [14] doesnt
commute with the compactication of the boost plane and thereby produces a non-trivial
projective phase. indeed, the free energy

may be computed using eq. (4.15) and the results of section 3.1. here an extra factor
of 2 has been inserted to take into account of the fact that one can interchange the roles
of the two endpoints of an oriented string [23]. after computing the discrete overlaps
of states using the orthogonality conditions, one can safely take the decompactication
limit l1   with w1 = 0 and q1 = 2n1/ l1 a xed continuum momentum variable.

(4.19)

in both cases where either v1 6= v2 or v1 = v2, one reproduces only the zero temperature
results for the scattering amplitude of a pair of moving dp-branes [7, 14] or the cancel-
lation of the gravitational attraction with the ramond-ramond repulsion between static
branes [23].

22

in contrast to that of the charged string, the moving d-brane boundary state (4.15)
represents only the ground state conguration. this dierence is easily understood when
one considers the lorentz invariance of the brane dynamics, i.e. that one can always boost
into the rest frame of a single moving d-brane. a pair of static dp-branes corresponds
to a neutral superstring in the t-dual picture, so that it is only possible to write down a
non-trivial temperature dependent interaction between a pair of static branes [10, 11], as
given in section 1. this triviality comes from the same zero mode operators, associated
with the presence of the wuyang term, as in the electric eld problem. it is therefore at-
tributed to the debye screening of electric elds that we described in the previous section.
in the present case, the screening comes from the dependence of the static interaction po-
tential on the gauge eld a0 that lives on the brane worldvolume (see eq. (1.12)) and it
results in a damping of the d-brane motion at nite temperature. it would be interesting
to understand more precisely how the features of the superstring eective action that we
discussed in section 3 aect the non-extremal thermal states of d-branes. in particular, it
would be interesting to understand how the information about a possible deconnement
phase transition stored in the eective potential for the polyakov loop operator is relevant
to the corresponding dimensionally-reduced supersymmetric yang-mills theory descrip-
tion at nite temperature. this may be useful in determining precisely how to unify the
two non-extremal deformations of d-brane congurations (by temperature and velocity)
and thereby describe the thermodynamics of their gravitational interactions. it may also
prove useful to a better understanding of the statistical mechanics of d-branes.

appendix a the wuyang term

in this appendix we will describe the formalism for adding wuyang terms to the action
in the presence of topologically non-trivial gauge elds. such terms are generally required
whenever a gauge connection on a compact space has a non-trivial ux. in that case, it
is not a globally dened dierential form on the conguration manifold and can only be
dened locally with respect to an open covering of the space. demanding that the action
be independent of the choice of covering used (or equivalently of the gauge choice) re-
quires the addition of (generalized) wuyang terms. we shall rst describe the formalism
generally in the case of an arbitrary compact manifold m, and then afterwards discuss

23

the specic cases of interest in this paper. more details can be found in [24], for example.
let {ua} be a nite open cover of the manifold m, and assume that the cover is
good, i.e. each ua and each non-empty intersection of the uas is a contractible open
set which is dieomorphic to an open ball in rd. a gauge eld a on a non-trivial line
bundle over m is given by the specication of a one-form a(a) dened everywhere on ua.
on each non-empty intersection of two open sets ua and ub of the cover, the corresponding
gauge elds a(a) and a(b) are related by a gauge transformation:

a(a)  a(b) = d(ab)

on ua  ub

(a.1)

by denition, the 0-form (ab) satises (ab) = (ba). now consider the situation on a
non-empty triple overlap of sets ua, ub and uc. summing up the three equations of the
form (a.1) which come from the distinct pairwise intersections of the three open sets, we
arrive at the equation

which by poincares lemma implies that

d(cid:16)(ab) + (bc) + (ca)(cid:17) = 0

(ab) + (bc) + (ca) = c(abc) = const.

on ua  ub  uc

the locally constant functions c(abc) satisfy the cocycle equations

c(abc)  c(bcd) + c(cda)  c(dab) = 0

(a.2)

(a.3)

(a.4)

and they encode deep topological information about the line bundle over m. they dene a
two-cocycle of the cech cohomology group h 2
c(m, r) of the manifold m with coecients
in the constant sheaf r. this group measures the obstructions to passing from local to
global data on m. there is a natural isomorphism between the cech cohomology group
and the ordinary derham cohomology group h 2

dr(m).

we now consider the appropriate modication of the wilson loop operator

w [a] = exp ii

a

(a.5)

integrated over a cycle  of m. since a is only locally dened on m, this integral
needs to be carefully dened using an open cover of m. consider a triangulation of m
such that the simplices induce a one-dimensional simplicial decomposition of the cycle
 = sa la. one each line la there is a gauge eld one-form a(a) as above, and so naively

the appropriate denition of (a.5) should be

w [a] = exp ixa zla

a(a)

(a.6)

however, the operator (a.6) transforms non-trivially under deformations of the simplicial
decomposition. it is straightforward to see that the induced change in integrand is a sum

24

of terms of the form d(ab) (according to (a.1)), so that by stokes theorem we should

intersection point of the lines la and lb. we must then cancel out the dependence on the
choice of locations of points pab in the double overlaps, which according to (a.3) requires

add the term pa,b (ab)(pab) to (a.6) in order to cancel this variation. here pab is the
the addition of the term pa,b,c c(abc).. in this way we arrive at the consistent topological

extension of the wilson loop integral:

w [a] = exp i

xa zla

a(a) xa,b

(ab)(pab) + xa,b,c

c(abc)


(a.7)

the operator (a.7) is independent of the choice of triangulation of the manifold m.

however, the operator (a.7) is ambiguous up to the choice of constants c(abc) (for ex-
ample, as we will see below, there are choices of covers which have no triple intersections).
although these constants do not alter the classical theory, in a path integral approach to
the quantum theory we must demand that the wilson loop operator (a.7) be independent
of the c(abc)s. this imposes the quantization condition

c(abc) = 2 n(abc)

,

n(abc)  z

(a.8)

mathematically, this simply means that c(abc)/2 denes a two-cocycle of the integer cech
cohomology h 2
c(m, z). in fact, this constraint imposes a quantization condition on the
ux of the gauge eld through any two-cycle  of m. to see this we consider the induced
covering of  by two-simplices a, such that the intersection of any two simplices a and
b is a line lab while the intersection of any three lines lab, lbc and lca is a point pabc.
we may then compute

(a.10)

let us now turn to the specic examples discussed in the text. for the cases discussed
in sections 2 and 3, we take m = s1  rd1, and the wilson loop integral over the circle
s1. the minimal good covering of s1 consists of three open sets ua which respectively
overlie the line segments [0, 
3 , ]. the covering may then be extended
trivially through the rd1 directions to give a good cover of the entire manifold m. for
the gauge choice (2.6), the transition functions (12) and (23) may be taken to vanish,
while the third one satises (a.1) which gives

3 ] and [ 2

3 ], [ 

3 , 2

0(13) = 0
~(13) = nc ~f

at t = 0, where we have used (2.2). integrating (a.11) gives

(13)(0) = nc ~f  ~x(0)

(a.11)

(a.12)

and, since the minimal covering has no triple intersections, the wilson loop operator
(a.7) yields the phase factor (2.7). note that in this case there is no analog of the ux
quantization condition (a.10) owing to the absence of non-trivial two-cycles in the present
manifold m, or equivalently that h 2

c(m, z) = 0 in this case.
  s1

a  u (l)

next we consider the case of the manifold m = s1

l  rd2 which is relevant to
the analysis in section 4. the minimal good cover of the torus s1
l consists of nine
open sets u ()
b which are obtained from the product of the minimal good coverings
of the circle described above. again the covering is trivially extended to the whole of m.
for the gauge choice (2.6) it follows from the above example that the only non-vanishing
transition function is (13)
l. now, however, the
condition (a.1) reads

l which is induced by those of s1

  s1

 and s1

0(13)
~(13)

l = ml(1  c)f
l = nc ~f

at t = 0 (with m the winding number around s1

l), so that we may take

(13)
l (0) = ml(1  c)f x0(0) + nc ~f  ~x(0)

(a.13)

(a.14)

the discreteness of the electric eld (4.4) along the compactied direction can now be seen
as a consequence of the cohomological quantization condition (a.10). taking  = s1

we have vol() = l and thus
