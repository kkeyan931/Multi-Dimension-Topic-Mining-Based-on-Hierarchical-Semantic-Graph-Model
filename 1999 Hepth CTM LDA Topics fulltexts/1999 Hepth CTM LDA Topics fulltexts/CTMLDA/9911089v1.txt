recently, various models of b  f theories in 3 + 1 dimensions, either in relation to the

bosonization of fermionic models [1], or with respect to their dual stueckelberglike gauge

models [2], have been considered. in this note we would like to show how to dualize b  f

models in a general way. also we show that such dualization is a special case of a general

formalism of pdualization of interacting eld theories. here we give a brief review of the

general pdualization procedure proposed in [3]. as usual, one denes a parent lagrangian

from which original and dual theories can be obtained. parent lagrangians are not uniquely

dened and there exist various methods for their constructions [4]. one of commonly used

method is based on a shift symmetry which has been also adopted in [2].

instead we

choose in our approach, what we believe to be, a simpler and more transparent formulation

of parent lagrangian. it will describe dualization of any interacting, theory of pforms in

arbitrary spacetime dimension [3]. let us start with a theory of a potential pform v (x) in

arbitrary dimensions d interacting with an a priori external current k(x). the dual eld h

is a d  p  1 form with the rank p as p  d  1. parent lagrangian is constructed as

lp = 

1

2(d  p  1)!

h1...dp1 h 1...dp1 +

1

(d  p  1)!

h 1...dp1 f 

1...dp1( v )

+

1

(d  p  1)!

k 1...dp1 h1...dp1

(1)

with the notation f 1...dp1( v ) =

1

(p+1)! 1...dp1dp...dfdp...d(v )

and

fdp...d( v )   [ dpvdp+1d ]. since, in general, dual eld h can be also a gauge po-

tential the external current k is not conserved, i.e. k 6= 0.

dualization proceeds in the following way:

i) varying the parent lagrangian with respect to the eld h leads to an equation of motion

h lp = 0  h 1...dp1 = f 1...dp1( v ) + k 1...dp1

(2)

the above equation, inserted back into (1), gives the interacting theory for the v eld

described by the lagrangian

lv,k =

1

1

1...p+1( v ) + k1...p+1 i2

2(p + 1)! h f 
2(p + 1)! h f1...p+1( v )  (1)(p+1)(dp1)k 

= 

1...p+1 i2

(3)

where, the k  is the hodge dual of the current k, and the factor (1)(p+1)(dp1) comes

from epsilon contractions. one sees from (3) that there is a current contact term in the

theory for v . such terms are unavoidable products of dualization procedure, and it turns

out that they are necessary to make dualization consistent [5], [6]. they will turn out to be

essential for what we are going to prove.

ii) the dual theory, on the other hand, is obtained varying parent lagrangian with respect

to the eld v which gives equation of motion as

v l = 0

:

1 h 

1...p+1 = 0

which has solution

h1...dp1 =  [ 1 b2...dp1 ]  h1...dp1(b)

(4)

(5)

therefore, the dual eld h is dened through (4), and it turns out to be a eld strength

of the dual potential b. (5) inserted back in (1) gives the dual theory for the eld b, coupled

to an external current k

lb,k = 

1

2(d  p  1)!

h1...dp1(b) h 1...dp1(b) +

+

1

(d  p  1)!

k 1...dp1 h1...dp1(b)

(6)

the end result of our dualization procedure is that to any interacting theory of the p

form v , described by the lagrangian (3), corresponds a dual interacting theory in terms of

the dual potential b, described by the lagrangian (6). one can verify that this procedure

reproduces all known dual theories as described for example in [4] ( see nal discussion ).

at this point one may wonder how can this procedure produce dualization of b f theories?

before we address the above question we rewrite, by partial integration, the interaction term

of the dual theory as

lb,int. 

1

(d  p  1)!

k 1...dp1 h1...dp1(b)

= 

1

(d  p  2)!

(1 k 12...dp1) b2...dp1

(7)

also notice that the described dualization procedure will not be aected if one adds to

the parent lagrangian (1) any function of the external current k. therefore we choose to

modify (1) , for the reason to become clear soon, as

lp  lp +

1

2m2(d  p  2)!

( 1k 12...dp1 )2

(8)

and a mass parameter m has to be introduced for dimensional reasons.

what we claim is that the general interaction term (7) is equivalent to the b  f terms in

special cases. to see this, let us rewrite the external current k as the hodge dual of a new

gauge eld a. by new gauge eld we mean independent of the gauge elds v and h,

which are subject to the dualization procedure.

k 1...dp1 =

m

(p + 1)!

1...dp1dp...d adp...d

(9)

inserting (9) into (7) we nd that the interaction term h(b)k translates into

lb,int. 

m
d!

1...db1...dp2 [ dp1adp...d ]  m b1...dp2f 

1...dp2(a)

(10)

which is a generalized b f term. qe d. then, the lagrangian (3) of the original theory

for v becomes

lv,a = 

1

2(p + 1)! (cid:16)  [ 1 v2...p+1 ] + m a1...p+1 (cid:17)2

2(p + 2)!

f 2

1...p+2(a)

(11)

(11) makes clear the choice of the function f (k), previously introduced in the parent

lagrangian. it gives a kinetic term of the new gauge eld a. therefore, starting from a

general interacting theory, we obtain gauge invariant, stueckelberglike lagrangian, of a

massive p + 1form potential a, where the starting pform v eld acts as a stueckelberg

conpensator.

the dual b  f theory of such stueckelberglike model follows directly from (6) as

lbf =

this is the general result we were set to prove in this note.

to make the nal result more transparent let us look at specic case of (3 + 1) dimensions.

we nd the following models:

1. choice of rank p = 0 implies identication of various elds as v  , b  b,

a  a. from the above formulae one nds the stueckelberg gauge theory of the

massive vector eld as

l =

model is given by

and so on ad nauseam, for other spacetime dimension.

the rst and the last models in the above examples are exactly those described in [2]

while we showed that the general formalism gives also a third model based on vector

tovector gauge eld dualization. as a conclusion, we have shown how stueckelberglike

massive gauge theories of an external gauge potential a, introduced as the hodge dual of

the external current k, and their dual b  f models, represent special cases of a general

dualization procedure of interacting theories. realization of stueckelberglike model is due

to the fact that dualization procedure combines the eld strength of the potential v and

the external current k in the form (3), thanks to the existence of the contact term k 2. our

general procedure thus enables to consider dual theories at will by appropriate choice of

the external current. note that the choice a = 0 in the stueckelberglike four dimensional

examples reproduces all known four dimensional dual free theories, i.e.

scalar to kalb

ramond (either way), and vector to vector. this proves the power and generality of the

proposed method.
