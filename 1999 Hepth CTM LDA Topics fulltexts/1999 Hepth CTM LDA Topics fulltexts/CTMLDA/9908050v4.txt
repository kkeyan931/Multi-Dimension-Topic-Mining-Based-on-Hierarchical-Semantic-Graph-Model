abstract

we consider the integrable xxz model with the special open boundary conditions.
we perform quantum group reduction of this model in roots of unity and use it for
the denition of minimal models of interable lattice theory. it is shown that after this
quantum group reduction sklyanins transfer-matrices satisfy the closed system of the
truncated functional relations. we solve these equations for the simplest case.

i. introduction

one of the most interesting open problem in conformal field theory is the connection
between its integrable structure [1] and the fermibose correspondence. this correspon-
dence manifests itself in the generalizations of rogerramanujian identities for characters
of minimal models of cft [3] discovered by kedem, klassen, mccoy and melzer [2]. the

simplest example of such identity is the following equation for a character of m(3, 4) minimal
model(ising model):

[tk(12k+1)  t(4k+1)(3k+1)] =

m>0

tm2/2

the l. h. s. of the identity has a natural explanation as feiginfuchs-felder representation of
the space of states of the model in terms of free bosonic eld. the r. h. s. can be interpreted [2]
as a partition function of right moving (chiral) fermions of one kind.

the similar identities were found in [2] for generic minimal model m(p, p + 1) with p  3.
in this case the r. h. s. can be considered as partition functions for p  2 species of right
moving fermions. it was shown by r.kedem and b.mccoy tahat the fermionic states arise
as low lying excitations in bethe ansatz approach for the 3-potts model which corresponds
to m(5, 6) minimal model. it would be interesting to generalize these results for general
m(p, p + 1) case.

in [1] the continuous eld theory version of the commuting transfer-matrices of integrable
lattice theory have been constructed and the conjecture that eigenvectors of these transfer-
matrices form the fermionic basis of virasoro characters has been claimed.

so the investigation of the connection between fermi-bose correspondence and integrable
structure of cft continues to be interesting both in the continuous eld theory and in the
integrable lattice theory and is one of the main motivations of this work [4].

the plan of the paper is the following. in part ii we consider the integrable xxz model
with special open boundary conditions which was investigated rstly by alcaraz et al. [5].
according to pasqier and saleur [6] we use the quantum group reduction of this model
for the denition minimal models of interable lattice theory (lm(p, p + 1)) which coincide
with minimal models of cft m(p, p + 1) in the termodinamic limit. in part iii we show
that after this quantum group reduction sklyanins transfer-matrix t (u) satises a closed
system of the truncated functional relations. in part iv we solve these equations for the
case lm(3, 4).

it was observed in [5, 7] that the eigenvalues of 2l-site xxz hamiltonian (2) with the
coupling  = /4 and  = /6 (we denote q  e) are exactly coincide with some of
the eigenenergies of l-site self dual quantum ising and 3-potts models with free ends (see
also [8]).

the remarkable properties of the model are connected with its uq(sl(2)) symmetry found
by pasqier and saleur [6]. namely hamiltonian hxxz commutes with the generators x, y ,
h of this quantum algebra dened as follows

x =

(3)

due to the quantum group symmetry the spectrum of the hamiltonian can be classied
according to the represenation theory of the algebra. for generic q its representations are
equivalent to the ones of the ordinary u(sl(2)) algebra and the conguration space (c2)n of
the spin chain can be splited into a direct sum of irreducible highest weight representations
j (j is the highest weight) which are in one-to-one correspondence to the ordinary sl(2)
representations. for example in n = 4 case (c2)4 can be decomposed as 2 + 31 + 20.

we will concentrate on the case qp+1 = 1 [10, 6]. in this case the generators x and y

are nilpotent on the space of states of the model

x p+1 = 0,

y p+1 = 0

(4)

as the consequence we obtain the very dierent picture of decomposition the conguration
space (c2)n .

for example if q4 = 1 and we try to decompose (c2)4 we get the following [6]. the
(c2)n decomposes now into sum of one bad 8-dimensional representation (2, 1) of type i
and four another good representations 22 + 21 of type ii [6]. the type ii representations
are isomorphic to the ordinary u(sl(2)) ones. what about the type i representation (2, 1)
it can be considered as a result of gluing of two representations 2 and 1. this (2, 1) rep-
resentation is indecomposable, but is not irreducible for it contains 3-dimensional invariant
subspace.

in general qp+1 = 1 case [10, 6] the conguration space splits into sum of bad type i
representations with highest weights sz  p/2 and good type ii repr-s with highest weights
sz < p/2 which are simultaneously not subspaces of some bad ones. the highest weight
vectors vj of the good repr-s can be characterized [6] by the following condition

vj  vp  ker x/ im x p

(5)

because of uq(sl(2)) invariance of hxxz we can restrict its action on the space vp. we will
call the result of this quantum group reduction as the minimal model of integrable lattice
theory (lm(p, p + 1)) because its termodinamic limit is m(p, p + 1), the ordinary minimal
model of cft with the virasoro central charge c = 1  6

p(p+1) [5, 6, 9].

iii. the quantum group reduction and the truncation
of the fusion functional relations

the xxz model(2) was solved by alcaraz et al [5] using the coordinate bethe ansatz method.
sklyanin constructed the family of transfer-matrices t (u) [11, 12, 14] commuting between
themselves and with hxxz. it was shown in [13] that sklyanins transfer-matrix t (u) com-
mutes with the quantum group uq(sl(2)). so the action of t (u) as well as hxxz can be
restricted on the space vp if qp+1 = 1. to perform this quantum group reduction for t (u)
we will use baxters t -q equation [9]

t(u)q(u) = (u + /2)q(u  ) + (u  /2)q(u + )

(6)

where (u) = sin 2u sin2n u and t(u) = sin 2u t (u) and q(u) are eigenvalues of baxters
auxilary matrix q(u) commuting with t (u).

the eigenvalue q(u) for the eigenvector with m = n/2  sz reversed spins has the

following form

q(u) =

m

ym=1

sin(u  um) sin(u + um)

the equation (6) is equivalent to bethe ansatz equations [14]

sin(uk  /2)#2n
" sin(uk + /2)

=

m

ym6=k

sin(uk  um + ) sin(uk + um + )
sin(uk  um  ) sin(uk + um  )

(7)

(8)

for the model (2) provided that t (u) has no poles.

the baxters equation (6) can be thought as a discrete version of a second order dier-
ential equation [1]. so we can look for its second (linearly independent) solution p (u) with
the same eigenvalue t(u) as in (6)

t(u)p (u) = (u + /2)p (u  ) + (u  /2)p (u + )

(9)

it follows from (6) and (9) that

q(u + )p (u)  p (u + )q(u)

(u + /2)

=

q(u)p (u  )  p (u)q(u  )

(u  /2)

(10)

if / is irrational it means that both parts of (10) are equal const and we can choose
it be 1. it means just a normalization of p (u). thus we obtain the quantum wronskian
condition[1]

q(u  /2)p (u + /2)  p (u  /2)q(u + /2) = (u)

(11)

4

if  is a rational part of  the expresions in (10) could be equal a periodic function
f (u) such that f (u + ) = f (u), but we assume that in this case f (u) is also equal to 1.

inserting (11) to (6) or (9) we obtain

t(u) = q(u  )p (u + )  p (u  )q(u + )

let us divide (11) by q(u + /2)q(u  /2), we get

p (u + /2)
q(u + /2)



p (u  /2)
q(u  /2)

=

(u)

q(u + /2)q(u  /2)

(12)

(13)

the r. h. s. of (13) a fraction of two trigonometric polynomials. so there exist the single

way to express it as the following sum

(u)

q(u + /2)q(u  /2)

= r(u) +

a(u + /2)
q(u + /2)



b(u  /2)
q(u  /2)

(14)

where r(u + ) = r(u) is a trigonometric polynomial whose degree degr(u) = 2n + 2  4m
and a(u+) = a(u) and b(u+) = b(u) are some trigonometric polynomials whose degree
are less than degq(u) = 2m. then (12) can be rewritten as follows

t(u)

q(u + )q(u  )

= r(u + /2) + r(u  /2) +

+

a(u + )
q(u + )



b(u)
q(u)



a(u)
q(u)



b(u  )
q(u  )

(15)

the term a(u)b(u)

q(u)

in the r. h. s. must vanish for it has extra poles which are absent in

the l. h. s. of (15). so we obtain that a(u) = b(u) and hence

(u)

q(u + /2)q(u  /2)

= r(u) +

a(u + /2)
q(u + /2)



a(u  /2)
q(u  /2)

provided that f (u) is such function that

r(u) = f (u + /2)  f (u  /2)

we can rewrite (13)

p (u + /2)
q(u + /2)



p (u  /2)
q(u  )

=

= f (u + /2) +

a(u + /2)
q(u + /2)

 f (u  /2) 

a(u  /2)
q(u  /2)

(16)

(17)

(18)

it means that we can choose the second solution of baxters equation (9) in the following

form [16]

p (u) = f (u)q(u) + a(u)

(19)

5

the new constructed solution of baxters equation is not a periodic function in the general

case. it is a periodic function if and only if there exists a periodic solution of (17) f (u).

we delay the discussion of the question when such solution does exist and get now the

consequences of its existence provided it takes place.

let us dene the following function

tk(u) = q(cid:16)u  (k+1)

2

(cid:17) p (cid:16)u + (k+1)

2

where k is any nonnegative integer.

(cid:17)  p (cid:16)u  (k+1)

2

(cid:17) q(cid:16)u + (k+1)

2

(cid:17)

(20)

comparing with (11) and (12) we see that t0(u) = (u) and t1(u) = t(u). it is easily to

obtain [16] from (20) the following functional equations for tk(u)

2

(cid:17) (cid:16)u  (k+1)
(cid:17)
2(cid:17) (cid:16)u  (k+2)

2

(cid:17)

(21)

tk(cid:16)u + 

2(cid:17) tk(cid:16)u  

2(cid:17)  tk+1(u)tk1(u) = (cid:16)u + (k+1)

2

tk(u)t1(cid:16)u  (k+1)

2

(cid:17) = tk+1(cid:16)u  

2(cid:17) (cid:16)u  k

2 (cid:17) + tk1(cid:16)u + 

these functional relations [17] coincide with the relations for eigenvalues of the fused
transfer-matrices of the xxz model received by zhou in [9] and by behrend, pearce, and
obrien in [19] for the abf models with xed boundary conditions.

let us return now to the question about existence of the periodic solution of (17). re-
calling that (u) = (u) and the denition (14) of r(u) we conclude that r(u) also is
an odd trygonometric polynomial whose degree degr(u) = 2n + 2  4m  2 provided the
number of the reversed spins m is not more than n/2. so such polynomial can be written
as follows

2n +24m

r(u) =

xm=1

rm sin mu

(22)

where rm are some coecients which are dened from (14).

if / is irrational the periodic solution of (17) does exist and has the following form

f (u) = 

1
2

2n +24m

xm=1

rm
sin m
2

cos mu

(23)

but if / is rational number the situation is more sophisticated. namely we will concentrate
on the case  = 

p+1 corresponding to lm(p, p + 1) model. in this case we get from (23)

f (u) = 

1
2

2n +24m

xm=1

rm
sin m

2(p+1)

cos mu

(24)

so if we try to nd the solution in sector when 2n + 2  4m  2(p + 1) or equivalently
sz  p/2 we see from (24) that the periodic solution does not exist. the reason is just a
resonance.

thus we conclude that a periodic f (u) and the second periodic solution of baxters
equation exist if we apply it to subspaces of the conguration space with sz < p/2 ! we see
that this inequality coinsides with the condition for the quantum group reduction from the
part ii . so we arrive to the main statement of this section:

6

the second periodic solution of baxter equation for  = /(p + 1) case exists if
and only if the conguration space of the model is undergone quatum group
reduction.
and for this case we have the additional relations for eigenvalues of the transfer-matrices
tk(u). the equation (20) takes now the following form

tk(u) = q(cid:16)u  (k+1)

so we see that

2(p+1)(cid:17) p (cid:16)u + (k+1)

2(p+1)(cid:17)  q(cid:16)u + (k+1)

2(p+1)(cid:17) p (cid:16)u  (k+1)
2(p+1)(cid:17)

and

tp(u) = 0

tp1k(u) = tk(u + /2)

(25)

(26)

(27)

so we obtain the second main statement of this section:

quantum group reduction of the model is equivalent to the truncation of func-
tional relations (21). 1

iv. the solution of the truncated functional equatios.
case  = /4.

in the case  = /4 (or q4 = 1) the truncated fuctional equations take the following form

t(u + /8)t(u  /8) = (u + /4)(u  /4)  (u)(u + /2)

(28)

after substitution (u) = sin 2u sin2n u to (28) we obtain

t(u + /8)t(u  /8) = 22n [sin2n +2 2u  cos2n +2 2u]

(29)

these equations have been considered and solved in [20] as the equations for the transfer
matrix of ising model on the cylinder.

for t (u) = t(u)

sin 2u we can rewrite the last equation as

22n 1t (u + /8)t (u  /8) =

n/2

yk=1

where we suggest n be even and

|k(u + /8)|2|k(u  /8)|2

(30)

k(u) = sin(2u + /4)  k sin(2u  /4)

and  = exp math
n +1 .

using that k(u + /8) = kk(u  /8) we nd 2n/2 real solutions of (30)

t (u) = tn1,...,nn/2  2

we recognize in integers {nk} the occupation numbers of the fermions of one dimensional
ising model. it is not suprising because lm(3, 4) exactly coincides with ising model as was
mentioned above [5, 7, 8].
