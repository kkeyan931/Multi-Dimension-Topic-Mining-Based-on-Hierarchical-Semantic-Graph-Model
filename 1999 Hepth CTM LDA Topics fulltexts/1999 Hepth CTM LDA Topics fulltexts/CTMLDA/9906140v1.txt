1 introduction

we construct poincare algebra in quantum eld theory using perturbative
similarity renormalization group procedure for hamiltonians. using the
scalar eld theory with interaction  g3 as an example, we obtain eec-
tive generators of the poincare group up to the second order in the coupling
constant g and show that they fulll all commutation relations of the poincare
algebra up to this order.

the canonical quantization procedure starts from a local lagrangian and
provides expressions for poincare generators p  and m  in free eld the-
ory. unfortunately, beyond the free eld case, canonical formulae for the
generators lead to divergences in the presence of local interactions. we have
to impose a cuto on kinematical variables, such as three-momenta of bare
particles, to make a theory nite. the regularization renders nite candi-
dates for the interaction-dependent generators but the cuto destroys formal
poincare symmetry of a local theory.

one can choose a regularization that will not destroy kinematical sym-
metries and then commutation relations between kinematical and dynamical
generators in poincare algebra are still satised, but the commutation re-
lations between dynamical generators are violated by the cuto-dependent
terms. in order to remove the bare cuto eects on nite particle dynam-
ics we use the similarity renormalization group procedure for hamiltonians.
this procedure achieves two goals:
it provides us with a method for nd-
ing counterterms in the initial bare generators and it also denes eective
particle dynamics for which we can seek eective poincare algebra genera-
tors in perturbation theory. the latter are free from the poincare symmetry
violating cuto eects.

our procedure is carried out using light-front form of dynamics, for two
reasons. one reason is that this form of dynamics has 7 kinematical and only
3 dynamical poincare generators, according to the classication of dirac [1],
while other forms have at least 4 dynamical generators. the other reason
is that the ground state formation problem of quantum eld theory can be
easily separated from the perturbative derivation of the poincare algebra in
light-front dynamics. this will be explained in next sections.

readers interested in the historical development of the poincare alge-
bra construction in light-front hamiltonian approach to particles dynamics
should consult ref. [2].

if the generators given by eqs. (4) - (10) were well dened, they should
obey the algebra given in appendix. however, p  and m j contain terms
proportional to g. these terms produce innities when multiplied by each
other or when applied to bare particles states in perturbation theory. we
have to introduce a cuto to make the theory nite.

we use the following cuto denition:

if we could consider only states with invariant masses m less than ,
then gj and g12 would provide vanishing contributions in matrix elements
1 and m j
between such states and thus could be ignored. unfortunately, p 
1
can produce states with invariant mass above  when acting on states with
m < . this means that we cannot limit ourselves to states with m < 
in the bare theory. we see that the regulrization alone is not sucient to
construct a desired set of poincare generators.

3 renormalization

the idea of renormalization is to eliminate from explicit consideration en-
ergy scales for above the range of physical interest and include eects of
their existence in eective interactions. we apply this idea using similarity
renormalization scheme [4], [5].

the initial regularized hamiltonian, i.e. p 

 of eq. (5) with added coun-
terterms, is transformed by a special unitary transformation into an eective
hamiltonian with a width .  is a parameter of dimension of mass and
it denes an upper bound on the energy change the action of the hamilto-
nian can induce. in our case,  measures the change of invariant mass and
our eective hamiltonian does not couple states with low and high invari-
ant masses. both, the transformation and the counterterms are found in
perturbation theory.

the unitarity of the transformation guarantees that both initial and ef-

fective hamiltonians have the same spectra.

starting from the regularized hamiltonian h we construct the whole
set of hamiltonians parametrized by . the hamiltonian h is expressed by
annihilation and creation operators corresponding to . h corresponds to
 =  and is also denoted by h. by assumption, all these hamiltonians
are equal,

h1(q1) = h2(q2) = h(q) .

(18)

annihilation and creation operators are represented here by q. we assume
that annihilation and creation operators corresponding to dierent s are
unitarily equivalent;

q = sqs

 .

(19)

6

the condition of equivalence of hamiltonians gives

h(q) = sh(q)s

 .

adopting the notation

we have

h = h(q) ,

h = s

hs

(20)

(21)

(22)

and the hamiltonian h(q) is obtained from h by replacing q with q.

transformation s and counterterms in h(q) = h are found from
the condition that all matrix elements of h between states of eective parti-
cles (created or destroyed by q) with nite relative momenta are independent
of  when   . the similarity renormalization group procedure is based
on this condition [4], [5].

for any operator a we can use the same transformation s,

and obtained the corresponding pertubative expansion (see appendix)

a = s

as

a1 = a1 + [a0, 1] ,

a2 =

1
2

[[a0, 1], 1] + [a1, 1] + [a0, 2] ,

(23)

(24)

(25)

where an denotes terms order gn.

the key element of the evaluation of eective poincare generators is that
they are expressed using operators q for eective particles. in other words,
they remain unchanged but reexpresed in terms of eective degrees of free-
dom.

in the case of hamiltonian p  the transformation simplies to

p 

1 = fp 

1 ,

p 

2 = f{p 

2 +

1
2

[(1 + f)p 

1, 1]} .

(26)

(27)

details of the similarity transformation are given in references [4] and [5]

and are not repeated here.

after the transformation all kinematical generators remain independent
of interactions. three dynamical generators, p  and m j, up to the second

7

order in g, get the similarity form factor f and m j obtains new terms
induced by the regularization.

 and m 2

2 that come out not narrowed by the similarity
form factor f are terms containing b13(p1, p2, p3, p4) and b22(p1, p2, p3, p4).
however, these terms produce non-zero results only when acting on states
with invariant mass close to . utilizing the fact that the commutators
between p 
 of second order in g are violated only by gj and
g12 and the latter give zero when acting on states with nite invariant masses,
we see that the existence of gj and g12 is irrelevant when one considers only
states of eective particles with nite small invariant masses. the essential
feature of the similarity renormalization group procedure is that one can
restrict the space of eective particles states that way with no error when
  .

the restriction to nite invariant mass states of eective particles is pos-
sible because matrix elements of the commutator, c, of any operator d
which has the width  and any other operator o, between states with nite
invariant mass, are of the following form

=xk h(2  |m2

i  m2

(40)

one can see that shi|c|jis vanish if o is non zero only when acting on
states with invariant masses on the order . namely, the  functions in d,
produced by similarity transformation, limit the range of intermediate states
to nite mass states and cause that o is not able to couple with intermediate
states |ki with invariant masses on the order of    if the external states
of eective particles have nite invariant masses.

10

here, m j

2 is not near-diagonal, but both m 1

1 get a similarity
factor f and m j
are diagonal. we can conclude that the second order in
g poincare algebra in eective theory is satised in the weak sense in matrix
elements between nite invariant mass states of eective particles. gj and
g12 vanish weakly in this sense when   .

1 and m 2

it is important to note that without the similarity transformation to ef-
fective particles, p  and m j would not have a near diagonal structure and
they would couple states with small invariant masses states with invariant
masses near . in such situation it would be impossible to apply the above
argument and obtain a valid poincare algebra in the weak sense.

4 conclusion

the construction presented here is only a rst step one can make seeking
derivation of a relativistic eective theory from rst principles of eld quan-
tization. we have not discussed here problems one has to solve before obtain-
ing physically interesting in a results from theory such as qcd. expansion
in an eective coupling constant should replace the expansion in the bare
coupling constant. we also did not discuss problems arising when projecting
poincare generators on a space with nite number of eective particles.
