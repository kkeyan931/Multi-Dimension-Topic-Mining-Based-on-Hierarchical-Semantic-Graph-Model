it is shown that the borninfeldtype modication of the quadratic yangmills action suggested
by the superstring theory gives rise to classical particle-like solutions prohibited in the standard
yangmills theory. this becomes possible due to the scale invariance breaking by the borninfeld
nonlinearity. new classical glueballs are sphaleronic in nature and exhibit a striking similarity
with the bartnik-mckinnon solutions of the yangmills theory coupled to gravity.

the standard yangmills theory does not admit clas-
sical particle-like solutions [13]. more precisely, this fa-
mous no-go result asserts that there exist no niteenergy
nonsingular solutions to the fourdimensional yang
mills equations which would be either static, or non-
radiating timedependent. [3]. non-existence of static
solutions can be related to conformal invariance of the
yangmills theory, which implies that the stressenergy
tensor is traceless : t 
 = 0 = t00 + tii, where
 = 0, ..., 3, i = 1, 2, 3. given the positivity of the en-
ergy density t00, this means that the sum of the principal
pressures tii is everywhere positive, i.e. the yangmills
matter is repulsive. this makes the mechanical equilib-
rium impossible [4].

the higgs eld breaks the conformal invariance of the
pure yangmills theory and so in the spontaneously bro-
ken gauge theories particle-like solutions may exist. two
types of such solutions are known: magnetic monopoles
and sphalerons. topological criterion for the existence of
monopoles is the non-triviality of the second homotopy
group of the broken phase manifold 2(g/h) associated
with the conguration of the higgs eld. thus topolog-
ically stable monopoles exist in the so(3) gauge theory
with a real higgs triplet, in which case g/h = s 2, but
do not exist in the su (2) gauge theory with a complex
higgs doublet, where the symmetry is completely broken
(the higgs broken phase manifold is s 3).

however, in the theory with doublet higgs another
particlelike solution has been found by dashen, has-
slacher and neveu [5].
its existence was explained by
manton [6] as a consequence of nontriviality of the third
homotopy group 3(s 3), indicating the presence of non
contractible loops in the conguration space. this so-
lution is the sphaleron; it sits at the top of the poten-
tial barrier separating topologically distinct yangmills
vacua. because of this position, the sphaleron is neces-

1

sarily unstable. still its role is very important, since in
presence of fermions it can mediate transitions without
the conservation of fermion number.

in the latter case, the manifold of the higgs broken
phase coincides with the gauge group manifold, and it is
not quite clear, whether it is the topology of the higgs
eld, or the topology of the yangmills eld itself which
is crucial for the existence of this solution. this issue was
claried after the discovery of sphaleronlike solutions
in the su (2) gauge theory coupled to gravity, without
higgs elds at all. particlelike solutions in this theory
were found numerically by bartnik and mckinnon (bk)
[7]; their relation to sphalerons has been explained by
galtsov and volkov [8] and sudarsky and wald [9] (for
a recent review, see [10]). this and other examples (sim-
ilar solutions exist in the at space yangmills theory
coupled to the dilaton) show that the topological reason
for the existence of sphalerons in the theories with gauge
elds is the non-triviality of third homotopy class of the
yangmills gauge group (note that 3(g) = z for any
simple compact lie group g). the higgs eld in this
case just plays a role of attractive agent balancing the
repulsive yangmills forces. in other words, its function
is to break the scale invariance of the yangmills theory
rather than the gauge invariance. the same symmetry
breaking may occur due to gravity or the presence of dila-
ton eld, which do not imply a spontaneous breaking of
the gauge symmetry.

the superstring theory gives rise to one important
modication of the standard yang-mills quadratic la-
grangian suggesting the action of the born-infeld (bi)
type [1113]. such a modication also breaks the scale
invariance, so the natural question arises whether in
the borninfeldyangmills (biym) theory the non-
existence of classical particle-like solutions can be over-
ruled. this is particularly intriguing since now neither
gravity, nor scalar elds are involved, so one is thinking
about the genuine classical glueballs. note that a mere

scale invariance breaking, being a necessary condition,
by no means guarantees the existence of particle-like so-
lutions, and a more detailed study is needed to prove or
disprove this conjecture. our investigation shows that
the su (2) biym classical glueballs indeed do exist and
display a remarkable similarity with the bk solutions of
the einsteinyangmills (eym) theory.

nonabelian generalisation of the borninfeld action
presents an ambiguity in specifying how the trace over
the the matrixvalued elds is performed in order to de-
ne the lagrangian. here we adopt the version with the
ordinary trace which leads to a simple closed form for the
action. in fact, another trace prescription is favored in
the superstring context, namely, the symmetrized trace
[11], but so far the explicit lagrangian with such trace is
known only as perturbative series [14]. for our purposes
the full non-perturbative lagrangian is needed, so we
consider the ordinary trace, presenting some arguments
at the end of the paper about the possibility of extension
of our results to the theory with symmetrized trace.

the biym action with the ordinary trace looks like a
straightforward generalisation of the corresponding u (1)
action in the square root form

here the dimensionless gauge coupling constant (in units
h = c = 1) is set to unity, so the only parameter of the
theory is the constant  of dimension l2, the critical
eld strength. it is easy to see that the bi non-linearity
breaks the conformal symmetry ensuring the non-zero
trace of the stressenergy tensor

this quantity vanishes in the limit   0 when the
theory reduces to the standard one.

which  can be eliminated by the coordinate rescaling

a trivial solution to the eq.(7) w  0 corresponds to
the pointlike magnetic bi-monopole with the unit mag-
in the born
netic charge (embedded u (1) solution).

for time-

to minus the lagrangian, so the total energy (mass) is

let us look now for essentially nonabelian solutions
of nite mass. in order to assure the convergence of the
integral (8) the quantity r 1 must fall down faster than
r3 as r  . thus, far from the core the bi correc-
tions have to vanish and the eq.(7) should reduce to the
ordinary ym equation. the latter is equivalent to the
following two-dimensional autonomous system [1518]:

w = u,

u = u + (w2  1)w,

(10)

where a dot denotes the derivative with respect to  =
ln r. this dynamical system has three non-degenerate
stationary points (u = 0, w = 0, 1), from which u =
w = 0 is a focus, while two others u = 0, w = 1 are
saddle points with eigenvalues  = 1 and  = 2. the
separatices along the directions  = 1 start at inn-
ity and after passing through the saddle points go to
the focus with the eigenvalues  = (1  i3)/2. the
function w( ) approaching the focus as    is un-
bounded. two other separatices, passing through saddle
points along the directions specied by  = 2, go to inn-
ity in both directions. since there are no limiting circles,
generic phase curves go to innity or approach the focus,
unless w = 0 identically. all of them produce a divergent
mass integral (8). the only trajectories remaining bound
as    are those which go to the saddle points along
the separatrices specied by  = 1.
the only
reasoning one nds
nite-energy congurations with non-vanishing magnetic
charge are the embedded u(1) bi-monopoles.
indeed,
such solutions should have asymptotically w = 0, which
does not correspond to bounded solutions unless w  0.
the remaining possibility is w = 1, w = 0 asymptoti-
cally, which corresponds to zero magnetic charge. com-
ing back to r-variable one nds from (7)

from this

that

w = 1 +

+ o(r2),

(11)

leaves the strip, it has to diverge. the divergence occurs
at some nite  = 0 with the following leading term :

where c is a free parameter. this gives a convergent in-
tegral (8) as r  . note that two values w = 1
correspond to two neighboring topologically distinct ym
vacua.

now consider local solutions near the origin r = 0. for
convergence of the total energy (8), w should tend to a
nite limit as r  0. then using the eq.(7) one nds
that the only allowed limiting values are w = 1 again.
in view of the symmetry of (7) under reection w  w,
one can take without loss of generality w(0) = 1. then
the following taylor expansion can be checked to satisfy
the eq.(7):

w = 1  br2 +

b2(44b2 + 3)
10(4b2 + 1)

r4 + o(r6),

(12)

with b being (the only) free parameter.

as r  0, the function r tends to a nite value

r = r0 + o(r2),

r0 = 1 + 12b2.

(13)

by rescaling r2r0 = r2 one can cast the eq.(7) again into
the form of the dynamical system (10), so by the same
reasoning the series (12) may be shown to correpond to
the local solution starting as   ,  = ln r from
the saddle point u = 0, w = 1 along the separatrix  = 2.
another bounded w satisfying the dynamical system (10)
might start at the focal point. but then in terms of r

w  cr sin 3

ln r + !

(14)

with  = const, this does not satisfy the assumption
r  const, therefore it is not a solution of the initial
system (7). thus we proved that any regular solution of
the eq.(7) belongs to the one-parameter family of local
solutions (12) near the origin.

it follows that the global nite energy solution start-
ing with (12) should meet some solution from the family
(11) at innity. since both these local solutions are non
generic, one can at best match them for some discrete
values of parameters. to complete the existence proof
one has to show that this discrete set of parameters is
non-empty. the idea of the proof is as follows. first,
rewrite the eq.(7) in the resolved form

w =  w + w(w2  1),

where the negative friction coecient is

the eq.(15) may be presented in the form of the energy
equation

e =  w2,

(1  w2)2.

(18)

for the ordinary quadratic yang-mills system   1, so
the energy e diverges soon after the solution leaves the
strip [1, 1]. however, in the present case  can become
negative when w and w grow up, and this can stop fur-
ther acceleration or even reverse it. one has to show
that this may happen before w leaves the strip [1, 1].
observe that in the eq.(15) all terms except for r/r in
 (16) are invariant under rescaling kr  r, while the
r-term changes to
r r1 +

k4
r4 [2 w2 + (1  w2)2].

(19)

thus, xing the scale k2 = b, where b is the free param-
eter of the local solution (12), one nds that, for su-
ciently large b, the function  can be made negative in
any desired region. now, if b is too large, the sign of the
derivative w will be reversed, and w will leave the strip
in the positive direction. for some precisely tuned value
of b the solution will remain a monotonous function of 
reaching the value 1 at innity (fig.1). this happens
for b1 = 12.7463.
by a similar reasoning one can show that for another
ne-tuned value b2 > b1 the integral curve w( ) which
has a minimum in the lower part of the strip and then
becomes positive will be stabilized by the friction term
in the upper half of the strip and tend to w = 1. this
solution will have two nodes. continuing this process
we obtain the increasing sequence of parameter values bn
for which the solutions remain entirely within the strip
[1, 1] tending asymptotically to (1)n. the lower val-
ues bn found numerically are given in tab.1.

it is easy to show that w can not have local minima
for 0 < w < 1, w < 1 and can not have local max-
ima for 1 < w < 0, w > 1.
in view of (11)(12) one
nds that any regular solution lies entirely within the
strip 1 < w < 1 and has at least one zero. once w

this picture displays a striking similarity with the one
occuring for the eym system [7,10]. however, there is
one important distinction. in the eym case the sequence
bn converges to a nite value b, and the limiting solu-
tion exists with an innite number of zeros [18]. in our
case the sequence bn has no nite limit. the region of
oscillations expands with growing n, and so does the size
of the particles (see fig. 2). typically, the rst and the
last amplitude have large enough values, while in the mid-
dle zone the amplitude of oscillations becomes very small
with increasing n (i.e. an observer placed inside the core
will see the unscreened magnetic charge). on the con-
trary, with n increasing the mass rapidly converges to
the nite value (9) corresponding to the abelian solution
w  0.

contiuously deformed to the trivial vacuum w  1 and
therefore are topologically trivial.
if one uses the biym lagrangian dened with the sym-
metrized trace, the equation of motion still preserves the
form (7) with another friction coecient  and an addi-
tional function of two variables w2, (1  w2)2 in front of
the force term. it can be shown that the minima/maxima
argument used above still holds as well as the -scaling
argument. therefore we expect that classical glueballs
will persist in this version of the biym theory too.

it can be expected that the spectrum of magnetic
monopoles in the biymhiggs theory is aected by
sphaleronic excitations like in the case of gauge mono-
poles coupled to gravity (for discussion and references
see [10]). the occurence of the limiting value of  found
in [14] is likely to be a typical signal.

like in the bk case, solutions with odd and even node
number n have dierent physical meaning [10]. the low-
est one with n = 1 is the direct analog of the sphaleron. it
can be shown to have the chern-simons number q = 1/2,
to possess a fermionic zero mode and it is expected to
have one odd-parity unstable decay mode along the path
from the initial to the neighboring vacuum. the poten-
tial barrier between the neighboring vacua hence has a
nite height. higher odd-n solutions also have q = 1/2,
but possess more than one decay direction leading to the
neighboring vacuum; they are expected to have n odd-
parity negative modes. solutions with even values of n
have q = 0, and correspond to the paths in the phase
space returning back to the same vacuum. these may be
