abstract

current superalgebras and corresponding schwinger terms in 1 and 3
space dimensions are studied. this is done by generalizing the quantiza-
tion of chiral fermions in an external yang-mills potential to the case of
a z2-graded potential coupled to bosons and fermions.

introduction

since the suggestion of supersymmetry as a possible symmetry in nature there
has been an increased interest in theories allowing for a z2-graded extension.
in this paper we will nd z2-graded generalizations of the lundberg[1] and
mickelsson-faddeev[2, 3] cocycle, and the underlying formalism. the cocycles
under consideration appear in the representation theory of the innite dimen-
sional lie algebras map(m ; g) of smooth maps from a d-dimensional compact
manifold m to a compact, semi-simple lie algebra g (e.g. g = su(n )). these
maps can be interpretated as gauge transformations in some gauge theory.

when m is a c manifold with a riemannian- and a spin structure there
is a natural embedding of map(m ; g) and a(m ), the set of yang-mills con-
gurations, into some sets gp and grp, p = (d + 1)/2, respectively. how this
is made will be described later. the lie algebras gp and grassmannians grp
are used in the algebraic investigation of the representations of map(m ; g). to
dene them one considers a separable hilbert space h and a grading operator
f0 (i.e. f0 = f 
; the star denotes the hilbert space adjoint) such
that the spaces h = (1  f0)h are innite dimensional. then gp is dened as
the lie algebra of all bounded operators x on h such that ([f0, x][f0, x])p
is trace class (we recall, see ref. [4], that an operator a on h is trace class if

0 = f 1

0

pn |(fn, afn)| is nite for an arbitrary orthonormal basis {fn} in h, and in
that case its hilbert space trace tr(a) =pn(fn, afn) exists, i.e. it is nite and
basis independent). similarly, grp is dened as the set of grading operators f
such that ((f  f0)(f  f0))p is trace class. the embedding described above

2

is then possible for the case h = l2(m ; v ), where v is a representation space
of g.

the representation theory for the case p = 1 (d = 1) is well-understood (see
for example ref. [5]). the reason is that elements in gp can only be implemented
(or second quantized) in the physical relevant representation of the eld algebra
if p = 1. it is also known how to make a z2 extension of the p = 1 case and a
graded lundberg cocycle has been obtained[6].

in higher dimensions the situation is much more dicult. a straight forward
attempt to second quantize elements in gp, p > 1 will fail. one will have to deal
with innities corresponding to the divergencies arising in certain feynman di-
agrams in gauge theory models. there exists several dierent renormalization
methods to handle such divergencies. the one we will use is close to the one
used in ref. [7]. here the implementations is by forms obtained by an appropri-
ate multiplicative regularization. for this, the grassmannians grp needs to be
introduced. the case d = 3 and chiral fermions leads to the mickelsson-rajeev
cocycle[8]. a corresponding boson cocycle has been obtained in ref. [9].

in this paper we will generalize the results described above to a z2-graded
case. a local form of the cocycles will be calculated, and some applications
motivated by gauge theory models will be considered.

2 preliminaries

to x notation we summarize some basic facts about z2-graded vector spaces
and algebras. an element v in a z2-graded vector space v = v0  v1 is said to
be homogeneous of degree , deg(v) = , if v  v,   z2  {0, 1}. if v is also
an algebra with grading preserving multiplication, i.e. v  v, w  v  vw 
v+ , then it is called a z2-graded algebra. we dene the supercommutator
[,]s : v  v  v , to be the bilinear map

[v, w]s = vw  (1)deg(v)deg(w)wv.

(1)

this formula, as well as all other formulas in the paper, is by linearity also
dened for non-homogeneous elements. equipped with the supercommutator,
v becomes a lie superalgebra (this subject is described in ref. [10]). every
linear operator x on v can be written in matrix form

x10 x11 (cid:19)
x =(cid:18) x00 x01

(2)

corresponding to the decomposition v = v0  v1. then deg(x) =  + 
denes a grading which provides every algebra of linear operators on v with a
z2-structure.

we will now consider a z2-graded hilbert space and dene certain operators
acting thereon. let h = h0 h1 be an innite dimensional separable z2-graded

3

hilbert space with the subspaces h0 and h1 both innite dimensional. let p
denote the orthogonal projection onto h: h = ph, and introduce the klein
operator  = p0  p1. we denote by b the algebra of bounded operators on h
and by b2p the schatten ideal classes (see ref. [4] consisting of operators x  b
such that (x x)p has a converging hilbert space trace (or supertrace, which
will be dened later). especially, b1 and b2 are the ideal of trace class and
hilbert-schmidt operators, respectively. we dene

grp (f0) = {f  b; f 2 = 1 and f  f0  b2p}

for some xed operator f0  b obeying

[f0, ] = 0

f0 = f 

0 = f 1

0

.

(3)

(4)

the operator f0 will be thought as being the sign of the free hamiltonian. it
is also useful to introduce the classes

gp(f ) = {x  b; [f, x]s  b2p}.

(5)

we regard the subspaces h0 and h1 as the one-particle spaces of charged
bosons and fermions, respectively. using the bosonic and fermionic fock spaces
fb(h0) and ff (h1) (dened in ref. [5] for example) with vacua b and f we
construct the fock space f(h) = fb(h0)ff (h1) with vacuum  = bf .
the bosonic and fermionic creation and annihilation operators can be combined
to the operators

a(f ) = ab(p0f )  11 + 10  af (p1f )

(6)

and a(f ) = a(f ), f  h, the fock space adjoint, which act on f(h). they
obey a(f ) = 0, and have a common, dense and invariant domain in f(h).
introducing the grading

deg(cid:0)a(p f )(cid:1) =  = deg (a(p f )) ,   z2, f  h

we can extend the canonical commutation relations (ccr) and anticommuta-
tion relations (car) of the bosonic and fermionic creation and annihilation
operators to the canonical supercommutator relations[6] (csr)

(7)

(cid:2)a(f ), a(g)(cid:3)s = (f, g) 1

[a(f ), a(g)]s = 0 f, g  h

(8)

where (,) is the scalar product in h. we now dene the csr algebra over h
to be the quotient of the free  algebra with complex coecients, generated by
a(f ), a(f ), f  h, and the identity 1, by (the two sided  algebra generated
by) a(f ) = a(f ), a(c1f1 + c2f2) = c1a(f1) + c2a(f2) and the relations in
(8). a representation of this algebra was constructed above, usually referred

4

to as the free (fock-cook) representation of the csr algebra. from a physical
point of view this representation is not satisfactory since it provides us with a
hamiltonian operator that is unbounded from below. we will instead consider a
representation where this is avoided (a so called highest weight representation
 see ref. [11]). using the elements in the free representation the so called
quasi-free representation of the csr algebra can be constructed:

a(f ; f0) = a(p f0
a(f ; f0) = a(p f0

+ f ) + a(jp f0
 f )
+ f )  a(jp f0
 f )

(9)

where j is a conjugation in h (an antilinear norm-preserving operator obeying
j 2 = 1) commuting with  and with p f0
 = (1  f0)/2. the procedure of
going from the free to the quasi-free representation is a generalization of the
well known process of lling the dirac sea.

3 second quantization and z2-graded cocycles

for certain bounded operators x on h the corresponding fock space operator
d(x; f0) can be dened. it is by denition the operator on f(h) that has
vanishing vacuum expectation value

< , d(x; f0) >= 0

and satises

(10)

(11)

f  h.

(cid:2)d(x; f0), a(f ; f0)(cid:3)s = a(xf ; f0),

where < , > denotes the scalar product in f(h). the relation (11) denes
d(x; f0) up to an additive c-number possibly depending on x. one way to
x the value of the c-number is by using eq. (10). let {fn}
n= be a complete
system of orthonormal homogeneous vectors in h with f0fn = nfn, where the
eigenvalues are indexed such that n<0 = 1 and n0 = 1. then it is easy to
see that if the operator d(x; f0) exists, it must be of form

d(x; f0) =



(fn, xfm) : a(fn; f0)a(fm; f0) :

xn,m=

(12)

where the normal ordering is dened by

: a(fn; f0)a(fm; f0) : =(cid:26) (1)deg(fm)a(fm; f0)a(fn; f0)
(13)
the necessary and sucient condition for existence of d(x; f0) is that x 
g1(f0)[6].

if n = m < 0
otherwise.

a(fn; f0)a(fm; f0)

5

the operator x will throughout the paper be thought of as the generator of
an innitesimal gauge transformation. the wave functions on which it acts are
assumed to be dependent on some f  gr1(f0) and second quantized according
to the polarization in h given by f0. to take into account the action a gauge
transformation has on f (corresponding to its action on the hamiltonian) we
introduce the operator g(x; f0) = d(x; f0) + lx , with the lie derivative
lx , x  g1(f0) acting on functionals m(f ), f  gr1(f0), as
m(cid:16)f  t [f, x](s) + o(t2)(cid:17) |t=0.

(lx m)(f ) =

d
dt

(14)

taking the supercommutator of two gs gives the relation

[g(x; f0), g(y ; f0)]s = g ([x, y ]s ; f0)  c(x, y ; f0), x, y  g1(f ). (15)
the schwinger term

c(x, y ; f0) = d ([x, y ]s ; f0)  [d (x; f0) d (y ; f0)]s .

(16)

can be calculated by taking the vacuum expectation value of (16) and perform-
ing some algebraic manipulations. the result is

c1(x, y ) = c(x, y ; f0) = 
=

2

str(cid:16)f0 [f0, x](s) [f0, y ](s)(cid:17)
strc(cid:16)x [f0, y ](s)(cid:17) .

(17)

since deg(f0) = 0 our notation (s) is to illustrate that the commutator as well
as the supercommutator may be used in the equations. the conditional trace,
conditional supertrace and ordinary supertrace can be dened in terms of the
ordinary trace according to

strc(a) = trc(a) =
str(a) = tr(a) a  b1.

1
2

tr ((a + f0af0)) ,

a + f0af0  b1

(18)

the term c is a graded generalization of the lundberg cocycle[1]. the graded
jacobi identity is equivalent with the 2-cocycle relation

c([x, y ]s, z; f0) + graded cyclic perm. = 0, x, y, z  g1(f0).

(19)

if a dierent condition than (10) had been used to determine the c-number
ambiguity in (11), then g(x; f0) would have been changed to g(x; f0) + (x)
for some complex valued function  of g1(f0). this would in turn change the
cocycle c to c + , with

(x, y ) = ([x, y ]s).

(20)

6

the new cocycle is in the same cohomology class as the old one since they dier
only by a function of type , a coboundary.

when considering the corresponding situation for some f  gr1(f0) we

dene g(x, f ), x  g1(f ) (or equivalently x  g1(f0)) by

g(x, f ) = u (f )g(x, f0)u(f )

(21)

for some unitary operator u(f ) on f(h). obviously it obeys a relation as
the one in (15) and with the same schwinger term. changing g(x, f ) by a
c-number (x; f ) gives a new kind of coboundary:

(x, y ; f ) = ([x, y ]s; f ) lx (y ; f ) + (1)deg(x)deg(y )ly (x; f ). (22)
since the schwinger term then can be f -dependent, the 2-cocycle relation will
now be

c([x, y ]s, z; f )  lx c(y, z; f ) + graded cyclic perm. = 0, x, y, z  g1(f ).
(23)
d(x; f ) does no longer exist as an operator when x  g2(f ) and f 
gr2(f0). therefore some additional regularization is needed. a useful ob-
servation is that d(x; f ) can still be dened as a sesquilinear form[13, 14].
proceeding as in the ungraded case[7] we make use of this by nding a cobound-
ary (b)(x, y ; f ) for x, y  g1(f ), f  gr1(f0) such that (b)(x, y ; f ) is
divergent when we extend to g2(f ) respective gr2(f0) and the divergency is
such that c1(x, y ) + (b)(x, y ; f ) will be nite.

we will now try to nd such a b. first we state:

lemma 1 let b(x; f ) = 1
gr1(f0). then

proof using the denition of coboundary (22) we get

the rst term vanish since it is the supertrace of a supercommutator. since
f0[f0, y ](s) = [f0, y ](s)f0 the third term cancels the f -independent part of
the second term. we are then left with (24) which was to be proven.

theorem 1 for x, y  g1(f ), f  gr1(f0) and c2(x, y ; f ) = c1(x, y ) +
b(x, y ; f ) it holds that

c2(x, y ; f ) =

1
8

strc(cid:16)(f  f0)h[f0, x](s) , [f0, y ](s)is(cid:17)

(29)

which exists even for x, y  g2(f ), f  gr2(f0)
the form of c2 is obtained by adding the expressions (17) and (24). that it is
convergent for the given classes is easily seen by the following calculation:

c2(x, y ; f ) =

1
str(cid:16)((f  f0) + f0(f  f0)f0)h[f0, x](s) , [f0, y ](s)is(cid:17)
16
= 

str(cid:16)(f  f0)2f0h[f0, x](s) , [f0, y ](s)is(cid:17) .

1
16

(30)

thus it can be written as a supertrace of a trace class operator and is therefore
well dened. the function c2 is a graded generalization of the mickelsson-
rajeev cocycle [8]. when x  gp(f ), f  grp(f0), p > 2 the fundamental
ideas are the same as for p = 2, and for this reason we omit to study these
cases.

8

4 a local form of the cocycles

we will now determine the form of the cocycles for the case h = l2(rd)  v ,
where the nite dimensional z2-graded space v introduces a natural grading
in h by: f : rd  v  f  h. several of the calculations in this section
are based on rules for psdos, summarized in the appendix. from now on we
restrict to the case of x,y and f being psdos of order 0. the operators x
and y are also assumed to be compactly supported (in conguration space).
we add the condition that the (super)commutator with f0 for x and y should
to be a psdo of order 1, while the corresponding condition for f is that
f  f0 should be of order 1 (the motivation for these conditions will become
clear later).
it is equivalent with the fact that the operators are in gp(f0)
respective grp(f0) for 2p = d + 1. this is a consequence of the fact that a
psdo on rd is traceclass if and only if its symbol is of order d  1 (see
appendix). it means that when d = 1 no regularization has to be done and the
cocycle of interest is c1. when d = 3 the operators under consideration are in
g2 and gr2, respectively. a renormalization procedure has to be performed,
leading to the cocycle c2.

for a compactly supported psdo a of form (74) and of order k the cut-o

supertrace can be expanded as

str(a) = z ddxz

ddq
(2)d p(q)strv (a)(q, x)

0

= ck+d(a)k+d + ... + c1(a) + clog(a) log(

)

+c0(a)0 + c1(a)1 + ...

(31)

with 0 some scale parameter, p(q) = (1  |q|
 ), and  is the heaviside
function. the -independent term c0(a) is of particular interest to us. we will
refer to it as the regularized supertrace str(a). it is just the supertrace when
the argument is a trace class operator. the operators that will be considered
here are such that clog(a) is zero and thus the regularized supertrace is well
dened. a psdo that is compactly supported, homogeneous of order d and
whose symbol can be written as a total derivative in momentum space has
the property that the cut-o supertrace is -independent and equal to the
regularized supertrace of the operator. this is a nice property so we now try
to nd coboundaries that can be added to the cocycles (17) and (29) in a way
that the resulting new cocycles can be written as a cut-o supertrace of such
an operator. an example of a psdo whose symbol to highest order can be
written as a total derivative with respect to some momentum space variable is
the supercommutator of two psdos

(32)

this is shown by using the formula (77) for calculating the symbol of the
product of two psdos. the second term in the expression is uninteresting to
us since it vanishes when integrating if one of the operators under consideration
is compactly supported. the lower order terms in the expression can also be
written as a sum of total derivatives of momentum and conguration variables.
motivated by the discussion above we try to nd some functions b1 and b2 such
that the new cocycles

c1 = c1  b1
c2 = c2  b2  b1

can be written as a regularized supertrace of a supercommutator.

str (f0x)

str(cid:0)f f0[f0, x](s)(cid:1)

will do if the restriction (f0)(q, x) = (f0)(q) is put on f0. from a phys-
ical point of view this is reasonable if thinking of f0 as the sign of the free
hamiltonian. it implies that

str(f0af0) = str(a)

is true for a trace class. the relation

strc(a) = str(a)

(35)

(36)

holds therefore if a is conditional trace class since it obviously holds when a
is trace class. now, using (17), (32)(36) and the linearity of the regularized
supertrace, we obtain

similarly, using

= str(cid:16)[f0, [x, y ]s](s)(cid:17) = 0

(38)

and the f -dependent part of the calculation in the proof of lemma 1 with the
supertrace replaced by the regularized supertrace (remember that the regular-
ized supertrace of a supercommutator is not necessary zero and the expression
in (27) is therefore useful) together with (29) and (33)(36) gives

5 two examples

some concrete examples will now be considered. the operators of interest are
the hamiltonian h = h0 + a and compactly supported gauge transformations
ex . the free hamiltonian h0, a and x are assumed to be psdos such
2)(q, x) = |q|2, while a and x are assumed to be of order 0. let
that (h0
f(0) = sgn(h(0)), using the spectral theorem with sgn(x) = 1 (1) for x  0
(x < 0). then

(h 2)(q, x)

= |q|2(cid:18)1 +

(h0)(a) + (a)(h0)

|q|2

(cid:19) (q, x) + o(|q|0)

(41)

and using (77),

(1/h 2)(q, x)
|q|(cid:18)1 

=

2|q|2

1

(h0)(a) + (a)(h0)

11

(cid:19) (q, x) + o(|q|3)

implying

(f )(q, x) =

|q|(cid:18)(h0) +

(a)
2 

(h0)(a)(h0)

2|q|2

(cid:19) (q, x) + o(|q|2).

(43)

thus we get that f  f0 is a psdo of order 1.

performing an innitesimal gauge transformation gives

(h0 + a)  (h0 + ax ) = (h0 + a [a, x]s [h0, x](s)) +o(|q|1). (44)
since both a and ax are psdos of order 0 we see that a gauge transformation
must obey the condition that [h0, x](s) is of order 0. this in turn implies that
[f0, x](s) is of order 1.
the way the operators have been introduced here they fulll all restric-
tions put in the former section. the results obtained there can therefore be
used. two dierent choices of h0, a and x will be considered in the next
section. for each choice the cocycles (37) and (40) will be calculated. note
that we only have to specify h0, a and x to highest order (as psdos) since
it is only this part of them that appears in the formulas for the cocycles. in
both cases v = vspin  vcolor  vz2 , that is, the boson and fermion wave-
functions will be assumed to have an equal number of spin and color (inter-
nal degrees) components. it is useful to dene some additional (super)traces:
strv = trspinstrcolor = trspintrcolorstrz2 .

the equations (37) and (40) for the cocycles has a momentum integration
over a domain that contains the origin. now, since there are factors 1
|q| in the
integrand, coming from (f(0)), the integral is not well dened. to avoid this
problem the factors 1
|q| will be regularize close to the origin in momentum space.
it turns out (see below) that the formulas for the cocycles are independent of
how such an infrared regularization is made. it is so since stokes theorem may
be used and thus the cocycles depend only on the behavior of the integrand
in a neighborhood of the boundary of the integration domain in momentum
space. we denote our regularized function by 1
and dene it to be equal to
1
|q| when |q|   and some smooth function when |q|  .

5.1 case 1

the operators will here be written in a matrix form according to the decompo-
sition h = h0  h1, just as was done in (2). to get a rather simple form of the

12

cocycles (37) and (40) we mimic the chiral fermion case and assume that also
the energy spectrum in the boson space is determined by the fermion hamil-
tonian. we choose to consider vector potentials that are of the same form in
all four sectors and it should be a generalization of the ordinary potential in
the fermion to fermion sector. thus:

q/ (cid:19) (a)(q, x) = a/(x) =(cid:18) a/00(x) a/01(x)
a/10(x) a/11(x) (cid:19)

where j , j = 1, 2, 3 are the usual pauli spin matrices and the as are
assumed to commute with these. motivated by the ungraded case (the usual
gauge transformations leading to the conservation of the electric charge) we
restrict ourselves to the case of x being a multiplication operator; (xf )(x) =
x(x)f (x), commuting with the pauli matrices.

when d = 1 a simple calculation leads to

this is recognized as a graded generalization of the ane kac-moody cocycle
(see ref. [11]).

let us now consider the case d = 3. since tr(j) = 0, j = 1, 2, 3, the rst

term in (39) vanishes and thus we may use equation (40). since

since j

the expression |q|r
|q| with 1 whenever it occurs in the integrand as long as 
is greater than the small regularization parameter . therefore the relation

this is recognized as a graded generalization of the mickelsson-faddeev cocycle[2,

of the schwinger term for chiral fermions.

5.2 case 2

massless bosons can be described by a vector-valued (needed for the spin and
the internal degrees of freedom) function  obeying the klein-gordon equation

2 = 0.

introduce the conjugate momentum,  =

where  denotes the fermionic wavefunction. the case when the elds , 
and  have an equal number of spin components will be considered. we choose
to consider gauge transformations x of the form

x(x) =

idx(x) dx(x) d
ix(x) d
|d|2

x(x)

x(x)

|d|2 idx(x)

x(x)

where the x12 (x)s are multiplication operators commuting with the pauli
matrices. the motivation for this choice is the following. we would like to have
multiplication operators commuting with the pauli matrices that mixes the 
and  among themselves. this motivates the choice of the four elements in the
corners of the matrix. the form of the remaining elements (to highest order)
follow directly from this and the condition that the (super)commutator with
h0 should be of order 0 together with the claim that the form of the gauge
transformation should be preserved under the supercommutator. taking the
(super)commutator with h0 gives

[h0, x(x)](s) =


i[d, x(x)] d
[d, x(x)]
|d|2
id[d, x(x)] d[d, x (x)] d
i[d, x(x)] d
|d|2

[d, x(x)]

[d, x(x)]

|d|2 id[d, x(x)]

which motivates us to consider vector potentials of form

ia/(x) d
|d|2

a/(x)

a/(x)

a/(x)

where the a/12(x)s are as in the former section (in the case d = 3 they are a
sum of pauli matrices multiplied with multiplication operators that commutes
with the pauli matrices).

to easier see the structure of the operators, they will be conjugated by

it is easy to check that the formulas for the cocycles (37) and (40) are inde-
pendent of such a conjugation (use (43) and identities as |h w
0 | = |h0|). thus,
w -conjugated operators can be used in the calculations.

when d = 3, the rst term in (39) will vanish by the same reason as for the

pseudodierential operators (psdo)

here some facts about psdo will be summarized (see ref. [16] and ref. [17]). a
psdo a on the hilbert space l2(rd)  v , v a nite dimensional vector space
and n = dim(v ), is determined by its symbol (a) which is a smooth n  n
matrix valued function, such that

(af ) (x) =

1

(2)d/2 z ddq(a)(q, x) f (q)eiqx

where

f (q) =

1

(2)d/2 z ddxf (x)eiqx

f  l2(rd)  v.

(72)

(73)

the psdo we are concerned with admits asymptotic expansion of their

symbols as

(a)(q, x)  (a)k(q, x) + (a)k1(q, x) + (a)k2(q, x) + ...

(74)

where k is an integer and

(a)j (q, x) = j(a)j(q, x),

for  > 1,|q|  1.

(75)

such a psdo is said to be of order k. a psdo a that has only one term in its
expansion

(a)(q, x)  (a)k(q, x)

is said to be homogeneous of order k.

the symbol for the product of two psdos is given asymptotically by

(ab)(q, x) x (i)|m|

m!

(cid:0)m

q (a)(q, x)m

x (b)(q, x)(cid:1)

(76)

(77)

where the sum is over all sets of nonnegative integers m = (m1, ..., md),
m1 + ... + md,

, etc., and m! = m1!...md!.

... md
xd

x = m1
m

x1

finally, the trace of a trace class operator in rd is given by

tra =

1

(2)d z ddxddqtrv (a)(q, x).

18

|m| =

(78)

thus, an operator with compact support in conguration space is hilbert-
schmidt if and only if it has a symbol of order d/2 or less.
