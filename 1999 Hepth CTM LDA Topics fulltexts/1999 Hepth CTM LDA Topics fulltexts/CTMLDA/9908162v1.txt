abstract

coincident m2 branes at a conical singularity are related to m theory on ads4  x7 for an
appropriate 7 dimensional sasaki-einstein manifold x7. for x7 = q1,1,1 = (su(2)  su(2) 
su(2))/(u(1)  u(1)) which was found sometime ago, the infrared limit of the theory on n
m2 branes was constructed recently. it is the su(n)  su(n)  su(n) gauge theories with
three series of chiral elds ai, i = 1, 2 transforming in the (n, n, 1) representation, bj, j = 1, 2
transforming in the (1, n, n) representation and ck, k = 1, 2 transforming in the (n, 1, n)
representation. from the scalar laplacian of x7 on the supergravity side, we discuss the
spectrum of chiral primary operators of dual n = 2 superconformal eld theory in 3 dimensions.
we study m5 branes wrapped over 5-cycle of x7 which were identied as (three types of) baryon
like operators made out of n chiral elds recently. we consider m5 brane wrapped over 3-cycle
of x7 which plays the role of domain wall in ads4. the new aspect arises when baryon like
operators(m5 branes wrapped over 5-cycle) cross a domain wall(m5 brane wrapped over 3-
cycle), m2 brane between them must be created.

introduction

in [1] the large n limit of superconformal eld theories (scft) was described by taking the
supergravity limit on anti-de sitter (ads) space. the scaling dimensions of operators of scft
can be obtained from the masses of particles in string/m theory [2, 3]. in particular, n = 4
su(n) super yang-mills theory in 4 dimensions is described by type iib string theory on
ads5  s5. this ads/cft correspondence was tested by studying the kaluza-klein (kk)
states of supergravity theory and by comparing them with the chiral primary operators of the
scft on the boundary. there exist also n = 2, 1, 0 superconformal theories in 4 dimen-
sions which have corresponding supergravity description on orbifolds of ads5  s5. the eld
theory/m theory duality also provides a supergravity description on ads4 or ads7 for some

superconformal theories in 3 or 6 dimensions. the maximally supersymmetric theories and
the lower supersymmetric cases were also realized on the worldvolume of m theory at orbifold

singularities.

the gauge group of the boundary theory becomes so(n)/sp(2n) [4] by taking appropri-
ate orientifold operations for the string theory on ads5  s5. according to general arguments
in [4], type iib string theory on ads5  x5 where x5 is a ve dimensional einstein mani-
fold with ve-form ux is dual to a four dimensional scft. in [5] it was found that for the
x5 = (su(2)  su(2))/u(1), the string theory on ads5  x5 can be described by n = 1
supersymmetric su(n)  su(n) gauge theories coupled to four bifundamental chiral super-
elds and supplemented by a quartic superpotential. a eld theory analysis of anomalous three
point funtion reproduced [6] the central charge expected by supergravity. baryon like chiral

operators [7] made out of n chiral superelds were identied with d3 branes wrapped over the
3-cycle of x5 and domain wall in ads5 was interpreted as d5 brane wrapped over 2-cycle of
x5. moreover the full kk spectrum analysis was done in a series of paper [8, 9].

by generalizing the work of [4] to the case of ads7  rp4 where the eleventh dimensional
circle is one of ads7 coordinates, (0, 2) six dimensional scft on a circle rather than uncom-

pactied full m theory was described in [10]. for su(n) (0, 2) theory, a wrapped d4 brane on
s4 together with fundamental strings was interpreted as baryon vertex. furthermore 3 dimen-
sional extension [11] was obtained by considering d6 branes wrapping on rp6. backgrounds of
the form ads4 x7 arise as the near horizon geometry of a collection of m2 branes in m theory
[12]. many examples where x7 is a coset manifold g/h were studied in the old days of kk

theories. it is natural to ask what is dual superconformal eld theory corresponding to m theory
on ads4  x7? as a rst step, we will consider only x7 = q1,1,1 in this paper. recently the
dual theory corresponding to this specic compactication in [13] turns out to be a nontrivial
infrared xed point. it is the su(n)  su(n)  su(n) gauge theories with three series of
chiral elds ai, i = 1, 2 transforming in the (n, n, 1) representation, bj, j = 1, 2 transforming

1

in the (1, n, n) representation and ck, k = 1, 2 transforming in the (n, 1, n) representation.
1 the global symmetry of the gauge theory is su(2)  su(2)  su(2) where each of doublets
of chiral elds transforms in the fundamental representation of one of the su(2)s.

since q1,1,1 described as the coset spaces g/h where g = su(2)  su(2)  su(2) and
h = u(1)  u(1) has the isometry su(2)  su(2)  su(2)  u(1) [16], we are looking for
an isolated singularity calabi-yau fourfold with this symmetry. that is, the geometry of eight
dimensional cone is calabi-yau fourfold while that of seven dimensional x7 is sasaki-einstein
manifold [12, 17]. 2 let us consider the complex manifold c,

on c8. this equation describes a surface which is smooth apart from the origin. the apex or
node is a double point, i.e. a singularity for which c = 0 and dc = 0 but for which the matrix
of second derivatives is nondegenerate. note that if zi solves (1) so does zi for any , so the
surface is made of complex lines through the origin and is a cone. the base of the cone is given
by the intersection of the space of solution of (1) with a sphere of radius 1 in c8,

|z0|2 + |z1|2 + |z2|2 + |z3|2 + |z4|2 + |z5|2 + |z6|2 + |z7|2 = 1.

(2)

these eight coordinates, invariant c action described by toric geometry [15] can be expressed
by triple product of six chiral elds ai, bj, ck with some independent embedding equations. it
turns out that two d term equations modded out by the action of two u(1)s give exactly the
manifold (s3  s3  s3)/(u(1)  u(1)). the metric on the conifold may be written as

ds2 = dr2 + r2gijdxidxj,

(i, j = 1, 2,   , 7)

(3)

where gij is the metric on the base of the cone that is exactly q1,1,1. the radial coordinate r is
identied with the fourth coordinate of ads4 and the section of the cone is identied with the
internal manifold q1,1,1. see also many papers [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] dealt with conifold
singularity.

in this paper, in section 2, we recapitulate the spectrum of scalar laplacian on q1,1,1 found
in [26] sometime ago, using the metric and seven coordiantes of q1,1,1 explicitly. the hyper-
multiplet spectrum in kk harmonic expansion on q1,1,1 agrees with the chiral elds predicted
by dual conformal eld theory as shown by [13]. in section 3, we clarify the property of three

baryon like operators identied as m5 branes wrapped around 5-cycle. in section 4, we claim
that m5 brane wrapped over 3-cycle of q1,1,1 plays the role of domain wall in ads4 and explain
corresponding dual eld theory when the baryon like operators cross the domain wall. finally
we will come to remaining wrapped branes.

1a dierent dual scft proposal was made in [14, 15].
2 the minimal supersymmetric n = 1 cft analysis and its rg ow have been studied when m2 branes are

located at the conical singularity on eight dimensional manifold with spin(7) holonomy in [18].

2 laplacian of q1,1,1 and spectrum of chiral operators

to describe the spectrum of chiral primaries in the qn1,n2,n3 cft we need the expression for
scalar laplacian on qn1,n2,n3. since x7 = qn1,n2,n3 is a u(1) bundle over s2s2s2, we take the
spherical polar coordinates (i, i), i = 1, 2, 3 to parametrize i-th two sphere, as usual, and the
angle  parametrizes the u(1) ber. by inverse kaluza-klein method, the seven dimensional
metric consists of u(1) ber coordinate together with a potential and six dimensional base
s2  s2  s2. from the most general expression for harmonic two-form u(1) eld strength, the
metric on qn1,n2,n3 is given by [27, 28, 29]

where c is a constant, i are scaling factors and nis characterize the winding numbers of the
u(1) eld over three s2s. the angles vary over the ranges

i  (0, ), i  (0, 2),   (0, 4).

(5)

all nis must be integers because we assigned period 4 on the variable . notice that all three
integers nis are necessary to characterize these spaces(while m pqr space can be characterized
by only two integers). one obtains inverse metric gi,j from (4) and the nonzero components are

the allowed range of variables,

notice that for ni = 0 and ni = 1 (11) determines the eigenvalues of the laplacian on s2 and

where a, b, c, i, j are smooth in the interval i  (0, ) and have a behavior at the end
points that can be determined by usual formula 3. the solutions are regular when they can be
expressed in terms of a hypergeometric polynomials. it is known that 4 this happens when

the rst equation in (15) comes from the relation between the lowest energy eigenvalue and
the mass which appears in the ads4 wave equation. the relation of dalembertian in ads4
to casimir operator was obtained in [30, 31]. for the scalars,  = 3

2q1 + m2/4. the
second relation in (15) comes from the formula of mass m2 = e + 176  24e + 36 in [32]
where the normalization for this is (  32 + m2)s = 0 for scalar eld s. this can be read o
directly from the eigenvalues of  because the relating elds have a mode expansion in terms
of the scalar eigenfunctions on qn1,n2,n3. other bosonic spectrum and fermionic spectrum can
be obtained by calculating higher spin laplacian also which are more complicated. see also
[33]. although the spectrum of dimensions on all the qn1,n2,n3 is not much interested in, q1,1,1
exhibits an interesting feature which is relevant to superconformal algebra. in this case, the
einstein condition implies that i = 4/3 and 1/c2 = 8/3(coming from the explicit form of
ricci tensor [28, 29] which we did not write down) and hence from (14)

e(q1,1,1) =

where li  |s|, s = 0, 1

the integer r charge, r is related to s by s = r/2. let us take r  0. one can nd the lowest
value of  is r and corresponds to a mode scalar with li = s because e(q1,1,1) becomes 32(2s2+
3s) with  = 24 and plugging back to (15) then  = r. thus we nd a set of operators lling
out a (r + 1, r + 1, r + 1)r/2 multiplet of su(2)su(2)su(2)u(1) where a subscript is
u(1) charge r/2 and the number r + 1 is the dimension of each su(2) representation.  = r
saturates the bound on  from superconformal algebra. it was shown in [13] recently that from
the harmonic analysis on q1,1,1 and the spectrum of su(2)  su(2)  su(2) representation
of the osp(2|4) hypermultiplets, the hypermultiplet of conformal dimension  = r and u(1)
charge s = r/2 should be in the representation li = s = r/2. 5

according to [34], the information on the laplacian eigenvalues allows us to get the spectrum

of hypermultiplets of the theory corresponding to the chiral operators of the cft. this part of
spectrum was given in [13] and the form of operators is tr(abc)r where the su(2)s indices are
totally symmetrized. from this, the dimension of abc should be 1. although the complete

5as pointed out in [25], there is a subtlety for nding the correct conformal dimension among two roots, +
which we denoted as simply  in (15) and  with minus sign, in the supergravity side. so far we assumed that
the integer number r is greater than 1. so the square root of rst equation in (15) gives rise to 2r 3. however,
when r = 1, this expression goes like 3  2r. therefore, we have to choose  in order to get the correct
conformal dimension which is equal to r. so in our case, this is another example of the ads/cft duality where
the unconventional  branch has to be chosen for the operators which has r charge of 1. recall that the s7
case where the spherical harmonics correspond to traceless symmetric tensors of so(8). all chiral operators in
the n = 8 su (n ) theory correspond to the conventional branch of dimension + except just one case. it is
well known that this family of operators with dimension  = k/2, k = 2, 3, is trx i1x i2  x ik where x i
are the scalars in the vector multiplet. using (  3) = m2, it is easy to see that  = k/2 = +, k = 3, 4,
and  = k/2 = , k = 2.

kk spectrum is not known yet, we expect that the relevant operators in higher towers are
descendant elds of tr(abc)r which would have the form of trf 2

from the discussion of [26], the rst series( = 1) give rise to possess extra massless super-
multiplets while from the second series( = 2) there are additional massless 0+ in massive
supermultiplets. the supermultiplet containing (2, 2, 2)1/2 has to include another scalars and
one of them corresponds to the lower component of the supereld tr(abc) which has dimen-
sion  = 1 while other corresponds to the upper component which has dimension + = 2.

therefore supersymmetry requires that one chooses dimension + for one scalar and  for

the other. it is easy to check that the value of 45 + e/4  636 + e is greater than equal to

0 for all possible values of e. there are no states below the breitenlohner-freedman bound
[35]. it is possible to have the second solution with minus sign in front of square root in (15)

provided the conformal dimension  is greater than or equal to 1/2 which is a unitary bound.
whether decendant elds whose dimensions are larger than the dimension of its chiral primary
parent are protected or not will be clear when one understands the full supergravity solution.

3 baryon like operators

by putting a large number of n of coincident m2 branes at the conifold singularity and taking
the near horizon limit, the metric becomes that [36, 13] of ads4  q1,1,1

logical constant  and scale factor l. since m2 branes have the operators with dimension n
by m2 tension formula and m5 branes have the operators with dimension n through the rela-
tion between mass, tension [37] and volume of branes, we consider wrapping a m5 brane over
5-cycle of q1,1,1. three 5-cycles spanning h5(q1,1,1) are the restrictions of the u(1) bration
to the product of two of the three p1s. a 5-cycle of minimum volume is to take the subspace
at a constant value of (3, 3) in the metric (4). to calculate the 5 volume, vol(5-cycle), it is
necessary to nd the determinant of the following metric by taking the subspace at a constant

value of, for example, (3, 3) in the metric (4)

where dk1kn
is the completely symmetric su(2) clebsch-gordon coecient corresponding to
forming the n + 1 of su(2) out of n 2s. therefore, the su(2)  su(2)  su(2) quantum
numbers of b1l are (n + 1, 1, 1). in order to understand these su(2) quantum numbers, it
is necessary to do collective coordinate quantization of the wrapped m5 brane along the ve
coordinates (, 2, 2, 3, 3) which acts as a charged particle because nonzero betti number
of q1,1,1 implies nonperturbative states only which can be charged. since the lowest angular
momentum of a charge particle is n/2, the ground state collective coordinate wave functions
form a n + 1 dimensional representation of the rst su(2) which rotates the rst s2. this s2
is not wrapped by m5 brane because it is localized at a constant coordinate (1, 1). of course,
wrapped m5 brane is a singlet under other su(2)s.

similarly, one can construct baryon like operators which transform as (1, n + 1, 1),

state collective coordinate wave functions represent a n + 1 dimensional representation of the

here the elds c

the ground state collective coordinate wave functions represent a n + 1 dimensional represen-
tation of the third su(2) which rotates the third s2. under the symmetry which exchanges
the fundamental elds a, b, c of the gauge groups su(n)1  su(n)2  su(n)3, these oper-
ators map to m5 branes localized at either constant (2, 2) or (3, 3). the existence of three
types of baryon operators is related to the fact that the base of u(1) bundle of internal space
is s2  s2  s2. since each of a, b, c has dimension 1/3 in the construction [13] due to the
fact that we have seen the conformal dimension of abc is 1 in the previous section and a
permutation symmetry among them, the dimension of the baryon like operators is n/3 which

is in agreememt with supergravity calculation we have worked before (24). this implies that
three 5-cycles are supergravity representations of conformal operators (25), (26) and (27).

for consistency check, one can consider the dimension of pfaan operator in so(2n) gauge
theory. gauge invariant baryonic operator a1a2n a1a2    a2n 1a2n has dimension n/2. the
so(2n) theory is dual to ads4  rp7 and the dual pfaan wrapping m5 brane on a rp5

moreover, an n = 2 theory [38] results from z3 orbifold action on s7 dened by coordinatizing
r6 by three complex numbers z1, z2, z3 orthogonal to m2 brane worldvolume and considering the
map zk  e2i/3zk for all k. minimal area 5-cycles on s7/z3 can be constructed by intersecting

the theory has gauge group su(n)1  su(n)2  su(n)3 with three (n, n) representations
between each pair of gauge groups. baryon like operators as in (25), (26) or (27) from the
bifundamental matter have dimension n/2.

4 domain walls in ads4 and other wrapped branes

since ads4 has three spatial dimensions, m2 branes in ads4 could potentially behave as a
domain wall. since m2 brane is the electric source of the four form eld g4, the integrated

hodge dual of four-form ux over 7 manifold rx7 g4 jumps by one unit when one crosses the
domain wall. this means the gauge group of the boundary conformal eld theory can change, for
example, from su(n)1su(n)2su(n)3 on one side to su(n +1)1su(n +1)2su(n +1)3
on the other side for ads4  q1,1,1. of course, for the anti-m2 brane, the gauge group will
change su(n  1)1  su(n  1)2  su(n  1)3. the similar situation also occurs when
m5 brane is wrapped on a specic 3-cycle of q1,1,1 to make a m2 brane in ads4. using the
orthonormal bases generated by the vielbeins of q1,1,1 for given metric (4)

where i = 1, 2, 3, the harmonic representatives of second, third and fth cohomology groups can
be written in terms of these combinations. note that from 4-th cohomology, h 4(q1,1,1, z) =
z2  (12 + 13 + 23) where is are the generators of the second cohomology group of
the p1s, 3rd homology h3(q1,1,1, z) can be obtained. in general, 3-cycle can be viewed as a
bration of  over 2 sphere parametrized by some combination of (i, i), i = 1, 2, 3, but we are
thinking a domain wall(a m5 brane wrapped over 3-cycle) together with baryon like operator(a

9

m5 brane wrapped over 5-cycle). in the previous section, we considered 5-cycle as a bration of
 over (i, i, j, j), i, j = 1, 2, 3. we take 3-cycle as 3 dimensional space orthogonal to 5-cycle
except one common direction. there exist three ways for m5 brane to be wrapped on 3-cycle
depending on the choice of three s2s in the base of u(1) bundle. when on one side of the domain
wall one has the original su(n)1su(n)2su(n)3, then on the other side the corresponding
one is su(n)1  su(n)2  su(n + 1)3 if we take rst 3-cycle. the matter elds ai, bj, ck are
lling out 2(n, n, 1) 2(1, n, n + 1) 2(n, 1, n + 1). similarly, if we take second 3-cycle, on
the other side the corresponding gauge group is su(n)1  su(n + 1)2  su(n)3. the matter
elds ai, bj, ck are lling out 2(n, n + 1, 1)2(1, n + 1, n)2(n, 1, n). also if we take third
3-cycle, on the other side the corresponding gauge group is su(n + 1)1  su(n)2  su(n)3.
the matter elds ai, bj, ck are lling out 2(n + 1, n, 1)  2(1, n, n)  2(n + 1, 1, n).

let us consider what happens if the baryons(wrapped m5 branes over 5-cycle) cross a

domain wall(wrapped m5 brane over 3-cycle). let us wrap m5 brane around particular 5-
cycle which is invariant both under the group su(2)b under which the elds bj transform and
the group su(2)c under which the elds ck transform. then the corresponding state in the
su(n)1 su(n)2 su(n)3 eld theory is b1 of (25). in the su(n)1 su(n + 1)2 su(n)3
theory, we have

where su(2) indices are omitted. these are either a fundamental of su(n + 1)2 or a funda-
mental of su(n)1. this is no longer a singlet because when one antisymmetrizes the color
indices on a product of n or n + 1 bifundamentals of su(n)1  su(n + 1)2  su(n)3 there
if we have m wrapped m5 branes over 3-cycle rather than a single
exists one free index.

wrapped m5 brane over 3-cycle, then according to m units of ux, the gauge group will be
su(n)1  su(n + m)2  su(n)3.

the wrapped m5 brane must have m2 brane attached to it. the new aspect of the domain

wall is that m2 brane must stretch from it to wrapped m5 brane. recall [39, 40] that two m5
branes with one common direction cross, a m2 brane stretched between them is created. by

dimensional reduction to the type iia string theory one can nd t dual version of hanany
witten eect [41]:when a ns5 brane and a d5 brane sharing two common directions pass

through each other, a d3 brane must be created. the action containing a chern simon term

is proportional to r g4(2, 2, 3, 3) b2(y0, ) indicating that g4 acts as a souce of b2 where

g4 = dc3 is four-form eld in m theory and b2 is a rr b eld. from the ux through
the baryonic m5 brane along (y0, , 2, 2, 3, 3) in the presence of domain wall m5 brane
along (y0, y2, y3, , 1, 1), the net charge that couples to b eld gives rise to a m2 brane along
(y0, y1, ) stretched between m5 branes is created. we can reduce to type iia string theory

10

along the , which is common to all branes. then d4 brane along (y0, 2, 2, 3, 3) passing d4
brane along (y0, y2, y3, 1, 1) creates a fundamental string along (y0, y1) direction.

similarly, if we consider m5 brane around particular 5-cycle which is invariant both under
the group su(2)a under which the elds ai transform and the group su(2)c under which the
elds ck transform. then the corresponding state in the su(n)1  su(n)2  su(n)3 eld
theory is b2 of (26). then the corresponding su(n)1  su(n)2  su(n + 1)3 theory has

which become a non singlet because when one antisymmetrizes the color indices on a product

that is, either a fundamental of su(n + 1)3 or a fundamental of su(n)2. moreover, when
we consider m5 brane over 5-cycle which is invariant both under the group su(2)a under
which the elds ai transform and the group su(2)b under which the elds bj transform, the
su(n)1  su(n)2  su(n)3 eld theory has b3 of (27). the corresponding su(n + 1)1 
su(n)2  su(n)3 theory has

in this case also there is one free index when one antisymmetrizes the color indices on a product

from h 3(q1,1,1, z) = h 6(q1,1,1, z) = 0, there are no states associated with branes wrap-
ping 4-cycle or 1-cycle. for m5 branes, there are three types of wrapping because there exist
nonzero h5(q1,1,1, z), h3(q1,1,1, z) and h2(q1,1,1, z). the rst case involves 5-cycle and pro-
duces particle in ads4 associated with baryon like operators (25), (26) and (27). the second
case involves 3-cycle and produces a domain wall we have discussed. the last one involves m5

brane wrapping 2-cycle and produces threebrane in ads4. at this moment, we do not know how
this can be realized in the full m theory and it is not clear what is interpretation of boundary
conformal eld theory. when m5 brane is wrapped around the eleventh circle s1 orthogonal to
2-cycle, then in type iia description, this is equivalent to twobrane in ads4. for m2 branes,

there exists only one type of wrapping which involves 2-cycle and produces particle in ads4
because m2 brane can not wrap higher dimensional space 5-cycle or 3-cycle. the mass of m2
brane wrapped 2-cycle goes like n from the mass formula which was not appropriate for the
candidate of baryon like operator that must behave like as n.

5 conclusion

in summary, since ads4  q1,1,1 is a supersymmetric holographic theory based on a compact
manifold q1,1,1 which is not locally s7, the dual su(n)1  su(n)2  su(n)3 gauge theory can
not be obtained from a projection of the n = 8 theory. the dual representation of baryon like
operators from a symmetric product of n bifundamental matter elds, fully antisymmetrized
on upper and lower indices separately, is a m5 brane wrapped around an 5-cycle in q1,1,1.
three ways of embedding 5-cycle are orbits of two of the three su(2) global symmetry groups
of the theory. a m5 brane wrapping 5-cycle can be regarded as a charge particle allowed

to move on the 2-cycle parametrizing remaining orbits. the 5 volume of the su(2) orbits
gives a dimension for the operators n/3 which matches exactly the eld theory. by using the
baryon like operators, wrapped m5 branes around 3-cycle of q1,1,1 behave as a domain wall
separating the original su(n)1  su(n)2  su(n)3 from, for example, su(n)1  su(n +
1)2  su(n)3. the crucial point was that a m2 brane is created when a m5 brane(wrapped
around 5-cycle) crosses a m5 brane(wrapped around 3-cycle). this means that a baryon is
no longer a singlet that agrees with the eld theory observation, because there exists one free

index when antisymmetrizing the color indices on a product of n or n + 1 bifundamentals of
su(n)1  su(n + 1)2  su(n)3.

there are various g/h models which has at least a supersymmetry less than or equal
to three in 3 dimensions. it is already known that there exists a dual conformal eld theory
corresponding to m pqr space. it is natural to ask how other cases can be realized in the boundary
conformal eld theories. it would be interesting to study whether one can nd wrapping branes

over various cycles of possible x7s and discuss their eld theory interpretations. the theory
of m2 branes at orbifold singularity, for example, c4/ tells us a variety of supersymmetric
theories [12] depending on how  acts. it is not known what is boundary conformal eld theory
corresponding to m2 branes at c4/(z2  z2) [42]. it is quite interesting to see how our conifold
description can be obtained from a deformation of orbifold singularity.

we would like to thank k. oh and r. tatar for collaboration in the early stages of this

project.
