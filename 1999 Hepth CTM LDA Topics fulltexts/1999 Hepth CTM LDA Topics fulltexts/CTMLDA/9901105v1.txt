abstract

membrane source-probe dynamics is investigated in the framework of the nite n-sector
dlcq m theory compactied on a two-torus for an arbitrary eleventh circle size. the
non-perturbative two fermion terms in the one-loop eective action of the matrix theory,
the (2+1)-dimensional supersymmetric yang-mills theory, is obtained by the supersymme-
try argument, including full instanton corrections. on the supergravity side, we compute
the classical probe action up to two spin fermion terms based on the classical super-
membrane formulation in an arbitrary curved background geometry produced by source
membranes satisfying the bps condition; two fermion terms turn out to correspond to the
spin-orbit couplings for membranes. we nd precise agreement between two approaches
when the background space-time is chosen to be that of the dlcq m theory, which is
asymptotically locally anti-de sitter.

1 introduction

by now considerable body of evidence toward the feasibility of the quantum description

of m theory via matrix theory [1, 2] has been accumulated. especially within the frame-

work of the discrete light-cone quantization (dlcq), the explicit scattering calculations

performed in matrix theory were successfully compared to the supergravity calculations;

becker, becker, polchinski, and tseytlin considered the scattering between two d-particles

(m-momentum) and showed that the matrix side calculation for the eective action pre-

cisely reproduces the eleven-dimensional supergravity side calculation up to two loops [3].

similarly in the context of the membrane scatterings, especially for the weak coupling

limit (the limit where the size of the eleventh circle is small), the agreement between the

two approaches was obtained by many authors [4]-[10]. recalling that the focus of the

most of these analysis has been the perturbative brane dynamics, what we attempt in

this paper is a systematic study of the non-perturbative brane dynamics.

our approach is based on two recent lines of developments. first, it was observed in

[11, 12, 13] that the appropriate space-time background geometries for the description of

the n-sector dlcq m theory compactied on a p-torus (p > 1) are not asymptotically
at4. for the membrane dynamics, that can be mostly easily studied within the context

of the m theory compactied on a two-torus, the relevant background geometry is asymp-

totically locally anti-de sitter (ads) type [12, 13]. in this paper, we will study, in detail,

the consequence to the eective action of these non-asymptotically at background ge-

ometries. second, initiated by stern, sethi and paban [14, 15], it has been noted that the

strong coupling dynamics and thus the eective action of supersymmetric gauge theories

is strongly constrained by the requirement of the supersymmetry. in the case when there

are sixteen supercharges, the constraints are strong enough to uniquely determine the full

non-perturbative eight fermion terms of the one-loop eective action (up to an overall

constant) of the (2+1)-dimensional supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) theory [15]. the

analysis presented in this paper is to give an m theory interpretation of the stern-sethi-

4for the m -momentum dynamics and the matrix quantum mechanics, as was rst formally noted in
[3] and claried in [11], the background geometry is described by the (zero-mode part of) aichelberg-sexl
type shockwave geometry [13]. this geometry is asymptotically at in eleven dimensions and the time
coordinate is asymptotically light-like.

pabans work in terms of the m theory in non-asymptotically at background geometries

of refs. [12, 13].

according to the argument of seiberg and sen [16], the microscopic dynamics of dlcq

m theory compactied on a two-torus is described by the (2+1)-dimensional sym theory

(we loosely call it matrix theory throughout this paper). what we nd in this paper is;

the dlcq supergravity eective action whose computation is based on ref. [12, 13] pre-

cisely agrees with the matrix theory eective action calculated by the techniques based on

ref. [14, 15] for an arbitrary value of the coupling constant (or the radius of the eleventh

circle), consistent with ref. [2]. this precise agreement will be explicitly veried for two

fermion terms in the eective action independently computed in both approaches, as well
as purely bosonic f 4 terms. it turns out that the two fermion terms, now including full

non-perturbative corrections, can be interpreted as spin-orbit couplings for membranes.

in the context of the matrix quantum mechanics versus supergravity, the spin-orbit cou-

plings for the d-particles were successfully computed and positively compared in both

approaches at the perturbative level [17]-[22]. since we consider an arbitrary value of the

eleventh circle size, our results applies equally well to the iia theory d2-branes, as well

as the eleven-dimensional m membranes. when we take the size of the eleventh circle to

the innity, the background geometry of refs. [12, 13] becomes an anti-de sitter space
tensored with a xed size seven sphere, ads4  s7. in this case, the duality conjecture of
maldacena [23, 24] relates the supergravity to the conformal phase (the infra-red limit) of

the (2+1)-dimensional sym theory. since we independently compute the eective action

for each theory, our results constitute a strong supporting evidence for the maldacena

conjecture.

the material presented in sec. 2.1 and sec. 2.2 is partially based on our results reported

in ref. [25] on the membrane dynamics in the dlcq m theory.

2 membrane dynamics: dlcq m theory compacti-

ed on a two-torus

this section is organized as follows.

in sec. 2.1, we start from the calculation of the

bosonic eective action for the spinless probe membrane moving in the background ge-

2

ometry of a spinless source membrane in the dlcq supergravity framework. since the

eleventh direction is compactied, our eective action includes all the contribution from

the mirror membranes. this result is reshued by applying the poisson resummation

formula along the eleventh direction for further analysis. in sec. 2.2, we positively test

the correspondence between the dlcq supergravity and matrix theory at the level of the

bosonic eective action. our logic is as follows; utilizing the sixteen supersymmetries of

(2+1)-dimensional sym theory, stern, sethi and paban [15] determined the exact eight

fermion terms in the eective action. we start by recalling why their analysis works and,

based on a supersymmetry argument, we show that we can calculate the exact purely

bosonic eective action from their eight fermion terms. thus determined eective action

from the sym theory is shown to be identical to the supergravity bosonic eective action

computed in sec. 2.1. based on the same supersymmetry argument, we sketch how to

recursively determine higher fermion terms from the purely bosonic term, and we per-

form the calculations to explicitly obtain the two fermion terms including full instanton
corrections5.

in sec. 2.3, we understand the dlcq supergravity side meaning of the

two-fermion terms of the matrix theory eective action. instead of considering a spinless

probe membrane, we investigate the spinning probe membrane dynamics using the curved

background supermembrane formalism of ref. [27] that was further analyzed in ref. [28],

while for simplicity the source membrane is still kept spinless. this analysis is performed

on a general curved background geometry produced by source membranes satisfying the

bps condition. the leading two fermion contribution of the spin eects to the eective

action is calculated to be the spin-orbit couplings; we explicitly determine the spin-orbit

couplings for membranes. this two fermion eective action obtained from the purely

supergravity side analysis turns out to be exactly identical to the two fermion terms com-

puted in matrix theory in sec. 2.2 when we choose the harmonic function of the dlcq

supergravity as in sec. 2.1. our analysis in sec. 2.3 points toward the possibility that

the eective action computed from both approaches should agree for all fermion number

terms.

5in our forthcoming article [26], we will determine, in the framework of supersymmetric quantum
mechanics, all fermion one-loop terms via supersymmetric completion and work out the corrected super-
symmetry transformation due to the inclusion of the one-loop terms.

2.1 preliminary: bosonic eective action from dlcq super-

gravity analysis

following the argument of seiberg and sen to take appropriate chains of u-dual trans-

formations, the background geometry of the n-sector dlcq m theory compactied on

a two-torus is given by the following eleven-dimensional covering space metric [12, 13]

ds2

11 = h2/3(dt2 + dx2

8 + dx2

9) + h1/3(dx2

1 +    + dx2

7 + dx2

11),

(1)

where the covering space eleventh coordinate x11 parameterizes a real line, and we require

the periodic identication of that coordinate via

x11  x11 + 2r.

(2)

the eleventh direction thus becomes a circle with a radius r. the n coincident source

membranes wrap the torus that extends over the x8 and x9 directions. the eleven-

dimensional harmonic function h is given by

h =



xn=

n

(r2 + (x11 + 2rn)2)3 ,

(3)

where  is a dimensionful constant and we introduce an so(7) invariant r2 = x2

1 +  +x2
7.
the harmonic function h contains the contribution from all mirror charges to respect the
periodicity under the lattice translation x11  x11 + 2r.

in the limit of the vanishingly small r, we can replace the summation in eq. (3) with

an integration and recover the near-horizon geometry of the n d2-branes of the type iia

supergravity. at the decompactication limit of the dlcq m theory, that corresponds

to the large r limit, the eleventh direction becomes indistinguishable from other non-
compact directions (x1,   , x7). in particular, the summation in the expression for h gets
dominated by the n = 0 term, which has the manifest so(8) symmetry; the transversal

so(7) symmetry gets enhanced to the so(8) symmetry at the decompactication limit.
in terms of an so(8) invariant r2 = r2 + x2
11, the harmonic function h in this limit has
a simple power law dependence on r like r6. since the transversal space metric h1/3
scales as r2, we see that the background geometry precisely becomes ads4  s7, where
the seven-sphere s7 has a constant size [29]. this is the limit where we have the large

4

n correspondence between the ads supergravity and conformal eld theory (cft), in

which the ads supergravity and the cft near the infrared xed point, i.e., the conformal

phase of the (2+1)-dimensional sym theory, become a dual description to each other [23].
in the context of the n = 8, (2+1)-dimensional sym theory, the moduli space of the
coulomb branch is described by n abelian dual magnetic 8 scalars and 7n scalars i,

where i = (1, ..., 7) is the vector index of the so(7) r-symmetry. the yang-mills coupling
constant g2
ym has mass dimension one, and the values of the n magnetic scalars should
be periodically identied with a period proportional to g2
ym. the moduli space is then n
symmetric product sn (r7  s1). in our supergravity set-up, we have n identical source
membranes, whose bps solution space can be parametrized by 7n positions in the non-

compact direction (x1, ..., x7) and n positions along the m theory circle; we reserve the

right to construct multi-center solutions from eq. (3) without violating the bps condition.

at the origin of the sym theory moduli space, i.e., in the case of the n coincident source

membranes as in eq. (3), it is known that the sym theory ows to an interacting spin(8)
invariant theory in the infra-red limit [30]. since the g2

ym has mass dimension one, the
infra-red limit corresponds to the strong coupling limit. the argument of seiberg and
sen [16] implies g2
p r2, where gs, ls and mp denotes the string coupling,
string scale and the eleven-dimensional planck mass, respectively6. the strong coupling
limit in the sym theory consequently implies the decompactication limit r   on the
supergravity side. we have already seen from eq. (1) that in the decompactication limit,

ym = gs/ls = m 3

the transverse symmetry of the background geometry enhances to so(8) from so(7), and
the background geometry becomes ads4s7 for the n coincident source membranes. this
suggests the validity of the aforementioned duality between the infra-red, i.e., conformal,

phase of the (2+1)-dimensional sym and the ads4 supergravity.

one of the main themes of our paper, the correspondence between the matrix theory

and the supergravity on the asymptotically locally anti-de sitter background geometry

is motivated by the consideration along the above line at least for the large r limit. our

primary interest here, however, will be to study the case of the arbitrary values of n and
r (thus g2

ym) following the dlcq prescription of ref. [2]. on the supergravity side, the
s. since the period of x11 is proportional to r, the period of
p = g2

ym, as mentioned before.

6from eq. (41), we nd that 8 = x11/l2
s = r2m 3

8 should be proportional to r/l2

5

treatment of the nite r is straightforward; we simply have to add all contributions from
the mirror membranes to respect the lattice translation symmetry x11  x11 + 2r, as
we did in eq. (3). however, on the sym theory side, we expect considerable instanton
ym is not very small7. the generic contributions from instantons to
corrections when g2
the eective potential are exponential terms, while the harmonic function from the super-

gravity has power law dependence. the key observation to solve this apparent problem

is to recall that the (2+1)-dimensional sym theory is the dimensional reduction of the

ten-dimensional sym theory. we reshue the series summation of eq. (3), that is the

lattice translation along the eleventh circle, using the poisson resummation formula:



xn=

f (n) =



xm=z 



d f () e2im .

the resummation can be exactly performed to yield the following identity.

each term of (5) is the harmonic function of the eight dimensional (x1,   , x7, x11)
transversal space. the rst term of (6) is in fact the harmonic function of the seven
dimensional (x1,   , x7) space. as such, it appears in the construction of the iia super-
gravity d2-brane solutions. it vanishes when we act (11)2 and thus it is the contribution

on the sym theory side, doing the perturbative calculations would be enough. the agreement between
the perturbative one-loop sym theory and the classical d2-brane dynamics was reported already in the
literature [4, 5, 6] (modulo the r independent v4 term which vanishes in the dlcq supergravity as shown
in eq. (13)).

from the massless modes under the kaluza-klein dimensional reduction along the m the-

ory circle. the remaining exponential terms are from the massive kaluza-klein modes;
when we act (11)2 to the m-th term, we get the eigenvalue m2/r2. in ref. [7], noting
that 2 cos x = exp(ix) + exp(ix), these remaining terms were interpreted as originating
from the m-momentum transfer between the source and probe d2-branes. from the yang-

mills theory point of view, the exponential terms look generically like the m-instanton
contributions. the r4 and r5 terms of the m-th term in (6) represent the perturba-

tive corrections in the m-instanton background. a priori, these perturbative corrections
should continue to all orders of the coupling g2

ym. however, as we will show in sec. 2.2, the
constraints from the remaining sixteen supersymmetry based on the argument of ref. [15]

cut the contribution at the nite order.

we now consider the purely bosonic dynamics of a probe membrane, which is taken
to be spanning the x8, x9 directions and is moving with a constant velocity v i = 0x i
( i = 1,   , 7) in a direction transversal to the probe and x11. the background geometry
for the nite value of r has the so(7) symmetry and the velocity is a so(7) vector,

consistent with the symmetry of the background geometry. the action for the probe

membrane is

s = t2z d3h  g

(9)

where t2 is the membrane tension and c  is the three-form gauge eld of the eleven-

dimensional supergravity. here i, j, k are the world-volume indices and the hatted indices

represent the eleven-dimensional indices. the metric gij is the induced metric on the

world-volume of the probe membrane given by

gij = gij + ix ijx j g i j ,

(10)

where the indices i, j represent the directions transversal to the probe. we choose the
static gauge where 0x0 = 1x1 = 2x2 = 1 and other derivatives of xi with respect to xj
are zero. we plug the metric eq. (1) with the function h of eq. (3) into the action s and

expand it in powers of the transverse velocity v. the action s becomes

the rst term of eq. (13) is the usual potential between two d2-branes in the ten-

dimensional type iia theory [6] and the second term is the potential due to the eect of

a single m-momentum transfer [7]. the approximate potential eq. (13) shows a notable
feature that there is no r independent v4 term that appeared in [7]. had we started

from an asymptotically at background geometry, that term will inevitably appear. in

the large n limit, it is natural to drop the term as was done in, for example, [6]. in the

dlcq framework, however, this term is automatically absent [10, 11]. this feature is

also present in the case of the exact potential, eq. (12).

2.2 matrix theory calculation of two fermion terms

according to the prescription of seiberg and sen, the dlcq m-theory on a two-torus is

described by a system of d2-branes wrapped on its t -dual two-torus [16], which becomes

very large when the original two-torus has a vanishingly small size. when the number

of d2-branes is n, the action for the system is just the (2+1)-dimensional u(n) sym

theory. the eective potential between the source and the probe membranes is given

by the eective potential of the sym theory, and we compare the supergravity bosonic

eective potential eq. (12) to the bosonic eective potential of the sym theory. we

note that our supergravity side calculation is actually for the two-body dynamics of the

8

source and the probe. from the gauge theory point of view, we do not give the vacuum

expectation values to the scalars that represent the position of the n source membranes,

thereby making them localized at one transversal space-time point, corresponding to the

origin of the sym theory moduli space.

since the metric of the moduli space of the (2+1)-dimensional the sym is at, the

tree-level eective action of the sym theory can be straightforwardly written as8

(0) = z d3x(cid:18)1

2

uiui +

i
2

 (cid:19) ,

(14)

where ui = i = f0i, the i-th component of the electric eld. the scalars i (i = 1,   , 7)
are the seven scalars of the vector multiplet (thereby having the so(7) symmetry). as-
signing an ordering o() = 1 and o() = 1/2, we note that o((0)) = 2. the action

(14) is invariant under the tree-level supersymmetry transformation:

i = ii ,

 = i d
dt

i = uii ,

(15)

where we assign o() = 1/2. the general structure of the one-loop eective action (1),
which is of the order o((1)) = 4, looks schematically like [17, 18]

(1) = z d3x(cid:16)f (0)u4 + f (2)u3h2i + f (4)u2h4i + f (6)uh6i + f (8)h8i(cid:17) ,

(16)

where [p] denotes a generic p fermion structure, and f (p) represents the bosonic coecient
function of the corresponding p fermion structure. upon adding this one-loop term (1)
to the tree-level term (0), the supersymmetry transformation law in eq. (15) should be

modied; we thus write the one-loop corrected supersymmetry transformation as

i = ii + n i,
 = uii + m .

(17)

8for our later purpose, we do not write terms in action with 1i and 2i. similarly, except for
the supersymmetric partner terms of the bosonic tree-level terms, we do not write fermion derivative
terms. the spinors have 2 of so(2, 1) indices and it is always implicitly assumed that an appropriate
2 2 matrix is sandwiched between two fermions. we use 8 representation of spin(7), but sometimes we
implicitly use 8c or 8s of spin(8). essentially, we are considering the center of mass dynamics of the
probe membrane. as such, our presentation closely parallels the supersymmetric quantum mechanics of
[14] and we follow their notation for the most part.

9

we note that o(n) = 2 and o(m) = 3 and, therefore, we can schematically write

n i = u2n i(0) + un i(2)h2i + n i(4)h4i

and

m = u3m (0) + u2m (2)h2i + um (4)h4i + m (6)h6i .

when we take the supersymmetry variation of the (0) + (1), the supersymmetry trans-
formation eq. (15) leaves (0) term invariant up to the order two. however, the correction
term in eq. (17) produces fourth order terms from (0). up to an order of four terms,
when it comes to (1) part, considering the variation of (1) under eq. (15) is enough;
the correction terms in eq. (17) when acting on (1) will produce terms of order six.
the variation ((0) + (1)) contains one, three, ve, seven and nine  terms, and they

have to separately vanish for the invariance of the eective action under supersymmetry

transformations. specically, we have:

(23)

(24)

b(f (0)u4) + f (f (2)u3h2i) + uiu2 n i(0) +
b(f (2)u3h2i) + f (f (4)u2h4i) + uiu n i(2)h2i  +

 m (6)h6i  = 0 ,

i
2

b(f (8)h8i) = 0 ,

where b and f represent the supersymmetric variation of the bosonic elds and the

fermionic elds, respectively. the key insight of paban, sethi and stern [15] is that the

eight fermion terms can be exactly computed via eq. (24) up to an overall constant without
the knowledge of other fermion number terms, n i and m; [8] consists of terms with zero,
two and four scalar structure. generically, the one-loop eective action (1) of the sym

theory is the summation of a perturbative term and m-instanton terms. hereafter, for the

notational convenience, we call the perturbative term 0-instanton sector. the function

f (p) consists of the instanton summation and we represent it as f (p) = p

m= f (p)

m where

where t ijkl is the eight fermion structure. the function f (p)

q,m denotes the bosonic coecient
function of the q scalar structure term of the m-instanton sector in p fermion terms. we

remark that eq. (25) gives the perturbative term, when we set m = 0, proportional to
13.

a crucial observation rst made in ref. [25] is that the bosonic zero fermion term

m can also be determined without the knowledge of n i and m, once the f (8)
f (0)
4,m terms are
determined. to explicitly see this, we pick out the maximum scalar structure terms from

the supersymmetric variation of the bosonic elds is appearing in eq. (27) will reduce

the scalar number, and these terms are not shown in eqs. (33)-(35) since they are no longer

maximum scalar structure terms. at each p-fermion term order, there are contributions
from the maximum scalar number terms of n i(p1) and m (p1). however due to the time

derivative

,

these contributions always include uii factor.
in contrast, in (32) the contribution is
i(u2)2. in (33)-(35), recalling that the 2p-fermion structure is in general a p-copy product
of i1j1    ipjp, n and up appearing there are always anti-symmetrized. therefore,
the contributions from n i(p1) and m (p1) do not mix with contributions from (32)-(35),

and each of the contributions has to separately cancel with the contributions (28)-(31).

2.3 membrane spin-orbit coupling from supergravity: matrix
theory-supergravity correspondence for two fermion terms

we now calculate membrane spin-orbit couplings from the classical supergravity side. for

this purpose, we consider the dynamics of a spinning probe membrane moving in the back-

ground geometry produced by spinless source membranes. the bps background elds

produced by the source membranes are known to be determined by a harmonic function

in iia supergravity or in eleven-dimensional supergravity. a notable technical feature of

our calculation is that we perform the calculation for an arbitrary choice of the harmonic

function in the eleven-dimensional supergravity. thus, by linearly superposing all mirror

brane contributions, which results from the compactication of the m theory circle, our

results are applicable to both type iia d-membranes and m-membranes. this will be

14

useful for the comparison to the matrix theory side calculations in sec. 2.2, since we in-

cluded full non-perturbative instanton corrections when computing the matrix theory side

results. by appropriately choosing the constant of motion for the harmonic function, the
spin-orbit couplings for the asymptotically at and so(1, 2)so(8) invariant background
geometry can be immediately written down from our analysis. for the precise agreement

with the matrix theory side calculations, we need, however, a non-asymptotically at
background geometry that is asymptotically locally ads4  s7.

in the superspace formalism with superspace coordinates z m () = (x (), ()) as
functions of the world-volume coordinates  i, the probe dynamics of the supermembranes
in the eleven-dimensional supergravity is described by the following action [27]9

9our conventions for indices are as follows. we use () for bosonic curved space indices and
( ) for fermionic curved space indices. we write these two indices collectively as (m n p ) .
among the bosonic indices, the directions tangential to membranes will be denoted as (ijk ), and
the directions perpendicular to the branes, ( i j k ). turning to the tangent space, we use (rst)
for bosonic tangent space indices and (abc) for fermionic tangent space indices. collectively these
two indices will be written as (abc ). among the tangent space bosonic indices, (ijk ) represent
the directions tangential to membranes, and ( i j k ), the perpendicular directions. the bosonic world
volume indices will be denoted as (ijk ). our signature choice for the metric throughout this paper is
( + +), and the totally anti-symmetric three-form tensor satises 012 = 012 = +1.

the dirac conjugate is dened as  = it 0. since we are considering spinless background

geometries, the background gravitino eld is set to zero. the spin connection and the

four-form gauge eld for the background geometry are denoted as st and

f = 4[c],

respectively, where the bracket implies the antisymmetrization normalized to unity. the
k eleven-dimensional gamma matrix products r1 rk are totally antisymmetrized (nor-
malized to unity) with respect to all indices. the symbols t 
and dx  are dened



as

where h is a harmonic function dened on the transversal space to the source membranes.

function from each source membrane. the metric (50) determines the non-vanishing

vielbeins and spin connections as

(52)

(53)

we note that the repeated indices in eq. (53) are not summed. for the description of the
j
probe membrane, we use the static gauge where we set ixj = 
i . due to the existence
of the -symmetry for the membrane action (47), the fermion  are constrained to satisfy

the -symmetry gauge xing condition

(1  ) = 0 ,

16

(54)

where  = 012. paying attention to the center of mass motion of membranes, we set

0x i = v i , 1x i = 0 , 2x i = 0.

(55)

the static limit is when v i = 0. by plugging eqs. (52)-(55) into the rst term of eq. (47)

via eq. (48), we obtain

up to two fermion terms. in deriving eqs. (56) and (57), we use the majorana properties
for the spinor  such as r1 rk = 0 for k = 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10 and the -projection condition

(54).

for the slow speed expansion, we introduce an ordering where o(v) = 1, o(i) = 1
and o() = 1. adding eqs. (56) and (57) and retaining terms of order up to four, we

obtain

upon deleting all the two fermion terms, we recover the bosonic eective action of sec. 2.1.

we note that the static potential vanishes up to two fermion terms consistent with the
analysis of [32], and the fermion terms other than the spin-orbit coupling term of (4)
all contain spinor eld derivatives. since  is a majorana spinor satisfying f 2 ii =

17

(f )ii(f ) for an arbitrary scalar function f , the transformation of the spinor  into 
via

 = 2h1/3

(62)

brings the quadratic terms l(2) to the tree-level action (14) of the (2+1)-dimensional sym
theory with the standard normalization, recalling (0)2 = 1. to compare the action
eq. (58) to the one derived in sec. 2.2, we decompose so(1, 10) spinor  into so(1, 2)
spin(7) (or so(1, 2) spin(8) in the decompactifcation limit r = ) by assigning it an
so(1, 2) index  and spin(7) index (or spin(8) index in the decompactication limit) a,
a. furthermore, as a simple background choice as before, we suppose v i and a are a
constant number and a constant spinor, respectively. then, the fermion derivative terms

drop out and we nally obtain

(63)

up until now, our derivation is valid for an arbitrary harmonic function h. choosing

h of sec. 2.1 corresponding to the asymptotically locally ads4 background geometry,

we nd that the action (63) is identical to the matrix theory one-loop eective action
(0) + (1)

spinorbit from eqs. (14), (39) and (42).

3 discussions

our analysis in this paper suggests that the supersymmetry might be the key element

for the agreement between the matrix theory and the supergravity. with sixteen super-
charges, the f 4 term in the supersymmetric yang-mills theory eective action is strongly

constrained to be determined up to an overall numerical factor, which can in turn be

uniquely xed by the known perturbative analysis of, for example, ref. [7]. on the super-

gravity side, the bosonic background geometries are determined by the bps equations.

once this background geometry is determined, the fermionic parts of the eective action

can also be determined by the supersymmetry. therefore, considering our previous work

[25] that showed the agreement of the bosonic eective action between the two approaches,

it is not surprising to nd a precise agreement for the spin-orbit coupling terms.

18

a pleasing feature of the eective action eq. (63) is that as soon as we assume the

background geometry satisfying the bps ansatz (thereby requiring h be a harmonic func-

tion), the classical fermionic action from supergravity immediately assumes the form of the

one-loop fermionic terms generated by the supersymmetric completion of the sym the-

ory. furthermore, for an arbitrary harmonic function h, the quadratic (free eld) classical
action l(2), eq. (59), looks as if it is a theory on a at background geometry (including
fermion term). this behavior is consistent with the atness of the (2+1)-dimensional

sym theory moduli space. a similar behavior, in the context of the yang-mills quan-

tum mechanics with sixteen supercharges, was observed for the tree-level supersymmetric

yang-mills theory eective action [14], where the non-renormalization theorem for the

terms was also proved.

the precise agreement between the matrix theory side description and supergravity

was veried for an arbitrary value of the eleventh circle radius and for all distance r,

consistent with the dlcq procedure of ref. [2], which was conjectured to be valid for the

nite n (for a xed value of p = n/r, n is proportional to r). the background metric

that produces this agreement is that of the asymptotically locally ads4 metric. in the

decompactication limit of the eleventh circle, this background geometry precisely reduces
to that of ads4s7. in this case, the harmonic function h vanishes to the power of r6 as
one approaches the asymptotic innity, unlike the asymptotically at geometries where h

goes to one. it is amusing to note that, therefore, the relationship eq. (62) between  and

 is the multiplication by an innitely large scale factor. this transformation is rather

similar to the removal of the pole contribution for the spinning elds in the treatment

of the ads/cf t correspondence, which results the holographic identication of the bulk

elds and the boundary elds up to conformal transformation [24].

there are several lines of generalizations to the analysis presented in this paper.

one issue is the determination of the static potential between two membranes. eight

fermion terms of the (2+1)-dimensional sym theory was, as noted before, already non-

perturbatively obtained in ref. [15]. on the supergravity side, the full expansion up to all

fermion terms of the supereld in terms of the component elds is available in ref. [33],
at least in the ads4 s7 background geometry. it will be interesting to explicitly verify if

19

the agreement between the strong coupling sym theory and the membrane dynamics in
ads4 supergravity holds for eight fermion terms and to test if, of the possible 256  256
membrane-membrane polarization states, only 256 states have the vanishing static po-

tentials. secondly, since we expect that the consideration of the spinless probe in the

presence of a spinning source will produce the same answer to the one obtained here,

due to the two-body nature of the source-probe dynamics, it will be interesting to do the

explicit calculations of the bosonic probe action in the presence of a non-trivial gravitino

eld. in this case, as noted in [32], the non-vanishing gravitino eld induces rotations in

the background geometry. this was in fact an approach taken by [19] for the supergravity

side analysis to determine the spin-orbit couplings for particle dynamics, which was in

turn shown to be identical to that of the supersymmetric yang-mills quantum mechanics

two fermion terms.
