abstract

exponential regularization of orthogonal and anti-de sitter (ads) space is pre-

sented based on noncommutative geometry. we show that an adequately adopted

noncommutative deformation of geometry makes the holography of higher dimensional

quantum theory of gravity and lower dimensional theory possible. detail counting for

observable degrees of freedom of quantum system of gravity in the bulk of noncom-

mutative space soq(3) and the classical limit of its boundary surface s3 is discussed.

taking noncommutivity eect into account, we get the desired form of entropy for our

world, which is consistent with the physical phenomena associated with gravitational

collapse. conformally invariant symmetry is obtained for the equivalent theory of the

quantum gravity living on the classical limit of boundary of the noncommutative ads

space. this is the bases of the ads/cft correspondence in string theory.

1 introduction

by making use of the idea that a quantum system of gravity may possess far less

degrees of freedom than usually expected for a 3 + 1 dimensional eld theory[1][2], it

was suggested recently that there is an ads/cft correspondence[3] [5]: the string

theory (m theory) on background of the form adsd  mdd is dual to a conformal eld

theory living on the spacetime boundary. here adsd is an anti-de sitter (ads) space

of spacetime dimension d, and mdd is a certain compactication space of dimension

d  d with d = 10 for string theory (d = 11 for m theory). a strong support for the

proposal comes from comparing spectra of type iib string theory on the background

of ads5 s5 and low-order correlation functions of the 3+1 dimensional n = 4 su(n)

super yang-mills theory. the dual super yang-mills theory lives on the boundary of

the ads space. to each eld i there is a corresponding local operator oi in the

conformal eld theory. the precise relation between string theory in the bulk and eld

theory on the boundary is

ze(i) = eise (i) = ht eirb

b,ioi

i ,

(1)

where se is the eective action in the bulk and b,i is the eld i restricted to the

boundary. in the large n limit, the string theory is weakly coupled and supergravity is

a good approximation to it. thus it is possible to describe a precise recipe expressing

correlation functions of the n = 4 super yang-mills theory in four dimensions in terms

of a calculations of tree approximation to supergravity performed in the bulk.

at rst sight, it seems very strange for us that quantum theories in dierent space-

time dimensions ever could be equivalent in any sense. the key to understand it is the

fact that the theory in the larger dimension is always a quantum theory of gravity. for

such theories the concepts of holography has been introduced by t hooft[1] based on

phenomenological study of the black hole theory and was referred as a generic proper-

ties of quantum system of gravity. the ads/cft correspondence is just an example

2

of the realization of the holography on quantum theory of gravity. from point of view

of general relativity, gravity is nothing but spacetime geometry. to check the malda-

cena conjecture, one has to start from investigating of adequate geometry description

for quantum theory of gravity. because the holography is a generic properties of the

quantum gravity, in principle, it should be deduced naturally from geometric proper-

ties of spacetime. t hooft showed that simple regularization of spacetime can not give

correct account of observable degrees of freedom for quantum theory of gravity. on

the other hand, the poor understanding of physics at planck scale also indicates that

the small scale structure of spacetime might not be adequately described by classical

continuum geometry. thus, new geometry should be introduced for quantum grav-

ity. it has long time been suspected that the noncommutitive spacetime might be a

realistic picture of how spacetime behaves near the planck scale[6][7]. strong quan-

tum uctuations of gravity may make points in space fuzzy. the noncommutative

geometry description[8][9] is a strong candidate for quantum theory of gravity. we

wish the holography can be obtained explicitly based on noncommutative geometry

picture of quantum gravity and show the ads/cft correspondence by demonstrat-

ing conformally invariant symmetry on the boundary surface of noncommutative ads

space.

in this paper, we present a kind of special regularization with exponentially increas-

ing spacetime cuto for both orthogonal and ads space based on noncommutative

geometry.

it is used to argue that the same minimal cuto of any geometry is the

planck scale lp, that the most direct and obvious physical cuto is from the formation

of microscopic black holes as soon as too much energy would be accumulated into too

small a region[1]. we show that an adequately adopted noncommutative deformation

of geometry makes the holography of higher dimensional quantum system of gravity

and lower dimensional theory possible. as an example, detail calculations are carried

out for the counting of observable degrees of freedom of quantum gravity in the bulk

of noncommutative space soq(3) and the classical limit of its boundary surface s3.

3

results show that a very small (may be < 1015) displacement of the noncommuta-

tive deformation parameter from its classical value 1 reduces sharply the entropy of

the quantum system of gravity. the desired entropy expression s = 4m 2 + c of

the universe can be deduced naturally. conformally invariant symmetry is obtained

for the equivalent theory of the quantum gravity, which lives on the boundary of the

noncommutative ads space. this is the bases of the ads /cft correspondence in

nonperturbative string theory and m theory.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we discuss the noncommutative

orthogonal space soq(3). the algebra satised by the coordinates and derivatives

is decoupled into three independent subalgebras by introducing of a new set of vari-

ables. quantum coherent states are constructed as reference ones for investigating

representations of the spacetime algebra. forms of hilbert space show clearly that the

noncommutative spacetime is discretely latticed with exponentially increasing space

distances. the noncommutative deformation parameter is determined by an algebraic

equation. the noncommutative space soq(3) has a same entropy or observable de-

grees of freedom with the classical s3 surface. section 3 is devoted to the study of

noncommutative ads2n space. conjugate operation is set up for the noncommutative

ads space. this conjugation has a induced counterpart for the set of decoupled coordi-

nates and derivatives. hilbert space of the noncommutative ads2n space is constructed

based on quantum coherent states. discrete lattice structure of the noncommutative

ads2n with exponentially increasing space distances is obtained. holography makes the

quantum system of gravity on the noncommutative ads2n space equivalent to the con-

formally invariant quantum theory living on the classical limit of its boundary surface.

this is crucial for the ads/cft correspondence of string theory and m theory. by

almost same procedures, properties of the noncommutative ads2n1 space are shown

in section 4. in section 5, some concluding remarks are given.

2 noncommutative geometry and holography

we begin by discussing the quantum space soq(3) with coordinates xi (i = , 0, +).

the commutation relations[10] among coordinates xi are

xx0 = qx0x ,
x0x+ = qx+x0 ,
x+x  xx+ = (q1/2  q1/2)x0x0 .

the algebra satised by derivatives is of the form

0 = q10 ,
+  + = (q1/2  q1/2)00 .

0+ = q1+0 ,

the action of derivatives on the coordinates is

x = 1 + q2x + qx00 + (q  1)x++ ,
x0 = qx0  q1/2x+0 ,
x+ = x+ ,
0x = qx0  q1/2x0+ ,
0x0 = 1 + qx00 + qx++ ,
+x = x+ ,

+x0 = qx0+ ,

0x+ = qx+0 ,

+x+ = 1 + q2x++ .

it is convenient to introduce the dilatation operators

(5)

(6)

the dilatation operators obey

+x+ = q2x++ ,
xk = q2xk ,

++ = q2++ ,

k = q2k ,

for k = 0,  .

the real form soq(3, r) (noted simply as soq(3) whenever no confusion rised) of the

noncommutative space soq(3) is obtained by a consistent conjugation

xi = cjixj ,

i = q2cij1 q1/2[+, xj] +

q

1 + q

[00, xj]! ,

(7)

where the metric cij is of the form

c =

.




it is should be noticed that throughout this paper we limit us at the case of q being

real.

by making use of the dilatation operators + and , we introduce a new set of

coordinates and derivatives

d = q11/2

[x i, x j] = 0 ,
[i, x j] = 0 ,

[i, dj] = 0 ,

[di, xj] = 0 ,
for i 6= j .

q in terms of the set of independent operators x j and

dj is of the form

(10)

at the q  1 limit, s3

q reduces to the familiar s3 surface with radius r.

the conjugate operation on x j and dj is induced by what on xj and j (eq.(7)),

thus, we conclude that the quantum heisenberg-weyl algebra corresponds to the

noncommutative space soq(3) can be decoupled into three independent subalgebras.

and then, one can investigate properties of the noncommutative space by constructing

hilbert spaces of the three quantum subalgebras.

d = q2d ,

x  = q2x  ,

(12)

we construct a quantum coherent state |zi as

|zi = expq2(

has been used and the reference state |0i was chosen such that x |0i = 0.

as in the classical case, the coordinate x  is diagonal in the quantum coherent

state basis

x |zi = z|zi .

(14)

the real value of parameter z may be interpreted as position of an indispersive wave-

pocket[11]. here we should notice that z can be any complex number because of us

working on a general quantum orthogonal space. the complex values of the quantum

coherent state parameter are consistent with conjugate operation on the noncommu-

tative space.

7

denote the quantum coherent state as

|0, zi  |zi ,

we can construct a representation for the quantum algebra a based on the quantum

coherent state as

x |n, zi = q2nz|n, zi ,
d|n, zi = q12n1z1|n + 1, zi ,
|n, zi = |n  1, zi .

(15)

it is clear from the hilbert space representation of the quantum algebra a that

the coordinates of the noncommutative orthogonal space is discretely latticed with

exponentially increasing space distances. in fact, this is in agreement with the discrete

dierence representation of quantum derivatives,

df (x ) =

f (q2x )  f (x )

(q2  1)x

.

similarly, we can construct the reference states |0, zi0 and |0, zi+ as

|0, zi0 = expq1(

|qz|)

(d0)m|0i0 ,

x 0|0i0 = 0 ,

|0, zi+ = expq2(

|q2z|)

x +|0i+ = 0 .

it has been strongly argued that the most direct and obvious physical cuto of space-

time is from the formation of microscopic black holes as soon as too much energy would

be accumulated into too small a region. thus, from a physical point of view, the black

holes should provide for a natural cuto all by themselves. the cuto distance scale

is suspected to be the planck scale. because of this origin of spacetime cuto, any

geometry we working on there should be a same minimal cuto lp. for the classical

geometry, the spacetime regularization is equal distance and thus there is one degree of

freedom per planck area. however, from the above discuss of noncommutative geome-

try, the spacetime is discretely latticed with exponentially increasing space distances.

thus, much less information can be stored in the noncommutative geometry. in fact,

this may be the origin of the holography for quantum system of gravity.

for the noncommutative space soq(3) with radius r, if the assumed minimal cuto

induced by the black holes themselves is the planck scale lp, it is not dicult to count

the degrees of freedom nbulk,

nbulk 

=

(q2ilp  q2(i1)lp)2

xi=1
q4 ln(cid:16) r
lp(cid:17)

2(q2  1)2 ln q

.

,

q2n = r ,

(21)

by taking the deformation parameter of the noncommutative space value to be deter-

mined by the algebraic equation

9

q4(q2  1)2 ln q =

(22)

lp(cid:17)
ln(cid:16) r
lp(cid:17)2 ,
8(cid:16) r

we can check that nbulk is exact equal to the degrees of freedom on the classical limit

of its boundary surface with radius r, nboundary,

nboundary =

4r2

l2
p

.

and then one can write down the entropy of our world at planck scale,

s = 4m 2 + c ,

(23)

(24)

where m is the mass of the world (black hole) in natural units and c a constant

entropy can not determined. this just is what was called holography or dimension

reduction in quantum theory of gravity by t hooft. at planck scale, our world is not

3 + 1 dimensional. rather, the observable degrees of freedom can best be described as

if they were boolean variables dened on a 2 dimensional lattice, evolving with time.

it is clear now that the exact meaning of the holography can interpreted as that the

quantum theory of gravity in higher dimensional noncommutative space is equivalent

to the theory living on the classical limit of spacetime boundary. this supplies a

reasonable picture for the t hoofts holography.

3 noncommutative ads2n space and exponential reg-

ularization

the noncommutative ads2n space can be dened as the 2n-dimensional noncommu-

tative real hyperboloid embedded in a (2n + 1)-dimensional space with coordinates xi

it is easy to check that, at the q  1 limit, the noncommutative ads2n space deduces

to the familiar ads2n space

for the noncommutative ads2n space, in components, the commutation relations

among coordinates are

for i > 0 ,

for i > 0 .

(27)

the commutation relations among the coordinates and derivatives are as follows

the dilatation operator satises

the noncommutative ads2n space is accompanied with the conjugation[12]

(30)

for k > 0, using the notations

yk = xk + qk+1/2lk+k ,

we complete the hilbert space constructure of the noncommutative ads2n space. this

shows that the noncommutative ads2n space is discretely latticed with exponentially

increasing space distances. the minimal cuto induced by the quantum gravity itself is

the planck scale lp. as in the case of noncommutative orthogonal space, the exponential

regularization may eectively reduce the amount of observable degrees of freedom of

the noncommutative ads2n space, even one can not enumerate it exactly because of

being innite[14]. an adequately adopted noncommutative deformation parameter q

(it may be even more closer to 1 than the case of limited geometry) can equate the

entropy of the quantum system of gravity in the bulk of noncommutative ads2n space

and what on the classical limit of its boundary. the commutative boundary is equal

for the noncommutative ads2n1 space, commutation relations among coordinates xi

   , n) are

xixj = qxjxi ,
xixi = xixi + qi2li1

for i < j and i 6= j ,

= q2xixi + qi2li ,

for i > 0 ,

where we have used the notation for intermediate lengths

the algebra satised by the derivatives can be written compactly as

ij = q1ji ,
ii = ii + qi2i1

for i < j and i 6= j ,

for i > 0 .

the commutation relations among the coordinates and derivatives are as follows

ixj = qxji  qqj kxij ,

for i 6= 0 ,
for j > i, and j 6= i ,

for k > 0, using the notations

then, the quantum heisenberg-weyl algebra corresponds to the noncommutative

dk|n, zi = q12n1z1|n + 1, zik ,
k|n, zi = |n  1, zik .

as the noncommutative ads2n space did, the noncommutative ads2n1 space is also

discretely latticed with exponentially increasing space distances. the minimal cuto

induced by the quantum gravity itself is the planck scale lp. the exponential regular-

ization eectively reduces degrees of freedom in the noncommutative ads2n1 space.

a very small amount of displacement of the noncommutative deformation parameter q

from unity equates the entropy of the quantum theory of gravity in the bulk of noncom-

mutative ads2n1 space and what on the commutative limit of its boundary surface.

the commutative boundary is equal distance regularized and possesses a conformally

invariant symmetry. thus, the equivalent theory living on the spacetime boundary of

the quantum system of gravity on the background of noncommutative ads space is a

conformal eld theory. this is the bases for the ads/cft correspondence.

5 concluding remarks

in this paper, by constructing hilbert space with quantum coherent state as reference

one, we have presented a kind of special regularization with exponentially increasing

spacetime cuto for both orthogonal and ads space based on noncommutative ge-

ometry. it has been used to argue that the same minimal cuto of any geometry is

the planck scale lp, that the most direct and obvious physical cuto is from the for-

mation of microscopic black holes as soon as too much energy would be accumulated

into too small a region. we have obtained results which show a very small (< 1015)

displacement of the noncommutative deformation parameter from its classical value

(1) reduces sharply the entropy of quantum system of gravity. the noncommutative

deformation parameter was determined by a well-dened algebraic equation. the non-

commutative space soq(3) with such a deformation parameter have the same entropy

19

or degrees of freedom with classical s3 surface. this is just the so called hologra-

phy for quantum theory of gravity. the holography makes the quantum theory of

gravity on the noncommutative adsd space equivalent to the conformally invariant

quantum eld theory living on the classical limit of its boundary. this is the bases of

the ads/cft correspondence of string theory and m theory. here we should stress

that the proper geometry for quantum gravity may be noncommutative but not clas-

sical continuum geometry. this is in agreement with the long time suspecting that

the small scale structure of spacetime might not be adequately described by classical

continuum geometry and the noncommutative spacetime might be a realistic picture of

how spacetime behaves near the planck scale. strong quantum uctuations of gravity

at this spacetime scale may make points in space fuzzy. all of the strangeness for the

quantum theories in dierent spacetime dimensions ever could be equivalent are come

from the noncommutative geometry description of the quantum gravity. the exact

form of the ads/cft is concerned with noncommutative ads space and the classical

limit of its boundary surface (on which the conformal eld theory lives). this suggests

that the gravity-gauge theory connection should be of the form: the string theory or

m theory on the noncommutative background of the form adsq

d  m q

dd is dual to

a conformal eld theory living on the classical limit of spacetime boundary. for the

type iib string theory on the noncommutative background adsq

5  s5

q spectra can

compare with low-order correlation functions of the 3 + 1 dimensional n = 4 su(n)

super yang-mills theory. the dual super yang-mills theory lives on the classical limit of

noncommutative ads spacetime boundary. only both in the large n and commutative

limit, the string theory is weakly coupled and the supergravity is a good approxima-

tion to it. therefore, in fact as t hooft suspected[1], the nature is much more crazy at

the planck scale than even string theorists could have imagined. formalisms of string

theory (gravity) on noncommutative geometry have to be constructed to gain sights of

unication of gravity and quantum mechanics.
