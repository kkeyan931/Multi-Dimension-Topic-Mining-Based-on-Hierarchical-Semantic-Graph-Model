abstract: we nd novel bound states of ns5, d6 and d8-branes in massive type
iia string theory. as the ns gauge transformations can change the chern class of
the rr eld these congurations should be thought of as nonlocal objects called
gerbes. we develop a global formalism for theories that involve massive tensor elds
in general, and apply it in massive type iia supergravity. we investigate the t-dual
ns5/d5-brane congurations in type iib, and relate them to an f-theory compact-
ication on calabiyau three-fold. we comment on the implications to consistency
conditions for brane-wrapping and the classication of d-brane charges in terms of
k-theory classes.

1. introduction

gauge symmetry has certainly proved to be one of the most ecient tools both
in quantum eld theory and in string theory. physically it facilitates the study of
complicated systems by enlarging the space where these systems are embedded, and

1

ensures the stability of, for instance, such solitonic objects as instantons. these
physical ideas are usually formulated mathematically in the language of ber bun-
dles, which are global constructions that encode much relatively easily accessible
information of the topology of the underlying manifold. in this article we give ex-
amples of string theory congurations that go beyond the realm of globally dened
bundles and belong in a sense to a stringy extension of gauge theories.

in a well dened theory two symmetries might seem to conict in that one
of them could shift the conserved charge of the other. this situation arises for
instance in any theory that involves massive tensor elds, such as many world-volume
eective theories in string theory, or the massive type iia supergravity. there a gauge
symmetry of one eld seems to shift the characteristic class of another eld. this
situation seems to fall outside the usual mathematical discussion that makes use of
everywhere dened bundles. recently, there have appeared constructions that seem
to be able to accommodate this kind of situations [1, 2]. these constructions, gerbes,
are most conveniently described in terms of locally dened line bundles, as opposed
to the everywhere dened ber bundles we referred to above. they are the next
logical step in a sequence that starts with functions on a manifold, and is followed by
line bundles. these constructions have already been applied in quantum eld theory
in [3, 4, 5].

in this paper we present some inherently nonlocal objects in string theory, and
show how to analyze them as gerbes. these objects arise naturally when one em-
ploys the symmetries of the eective type iia supergravity theory to the full. the
example at hand is a bound state of ns5-branes and d6-branes in the presence of a
cosmological constant. gerbes cannot be seen as local objects in the same sense as
normal bundles or chanpaton bundles can. this fact also sheds light on some of
the diculties encountered in classifying type iia d-branes in terms of ber bundles.
in [6] it was suggested that d-brane charges could be described by k-theory
classes. the classication of a large class of the cases encountered in string theory was
performed (for trivial ns two-form backgrounds) in [7], and continued in [8, 9, 10].
the classication was based on the idea that supersymmetric d-branes could be
built as bound states of non-supersymmetric higher-dimensional d-branes [11]. the
stability of a these braneanti-brane constructions depends on the properties of the
branes normal and chanpaton bundles. on the other hand, vector bundles on a
manifold x are in general classied in k-theory. this leads to a partial classication
of d-brane charges in terms of the groups k(x) in type iib and k 1(x) in type iia.
the classication was also extended to comprise the so-called twisted ber bundles,
which are essentially trivial gerbes. having introduced gerbes as generalizations of
ber bundles the next logical step would be to extend this classication to something
that should then be the k-theory of gerbes, in order to cope with general ns two-
form backgrounds and the cosmological constant in the case of type iia. this still
remains to be done.

2

in all of these congurations the integral cohomology class of the ns eld strength
plays a central role. it appears as an obstruction to wrapping a brane on a subman-
ifold or, in certain cases, to classifying d-brane charges in k-theory, and it is the
characteristic class of a gerbe. these appearances are intimately connected. in this
paper we attempt among other things to clarify the role played by the two-form ns
eld in string theory. in the same way that a line bundle has a natural character-
istic class related to, say, in the case of the dirac monopole bundle to the number
of monopoles, the characteristic class of the gerbe will in our constructions describe
the number of ns5-branes. the local line bundles needed for dening a gerbe imply
that there are, in a certain sense, nonlocal d6-branes. nevertheless, we can nd a
globally dened modied eight-form eld strength. the topological stability of these
constructions follows from the gerbe structure.

another central ingredient will be the zero-form eld strength in type iia string
theory, the cosmological constant. we shall consider it a section of a constant sheaf;
allowing it to jump would indicate the presence of a d8-brane. for the most part
of the paper the cosmological constant will be a true, though non-zero, constant as
turns out to be necessary for the consistency of a gerbe. string theory would seem
to resolve, as we shall argue, at least those problems that arise from the presence of
the cosmological constant by simply relating the problematic type iia solutions to
more classiable ones in type iib.

in order to gain further understanding of these systems we nd the t-dual solu-
tions on the type iib side. these turn out to include a non-trivial axion, ns5/d5-
brane dyons, d7-branes and orbifold singularities. stability considerations in iia
lead one to a consistent treatment of the decit angle in type iib. the form-eld
equations of motion can be solved explicitly, but the metric and the dilaton must
be extracted from an f-theory construction on an elliptically bered calabiyau
three-fold.

the article is organized as follows: we begin with a toy model that involves
massive tensor elds in general. we then give a brief account of what a gerbe is.
we present our ansatz in massive type iia and solve the form-eld equations of
motion, dualize the solutions, and relate the construction to an f-theory solution.
we then discuss the classication of in particular type iia branes in k-theory and
the consistency conditions for brane wrapping in the last section.

2. global structures in eld theory

2.1 massive form-elds

the constructions that we shall make use of below are characteristic to any theory,
where tensor elds become massive. these theories include the maxwellproca the-
ory, romans massive iia supergravity [12], and eective world-volume theories on

3

branes [13, 14]. in order to extract the essential features of these systems, it may be
helpful to start by considering the toy model

s = zx

dc  dc + (mc + dl)  (mc + dl) + . . . .

(2.1)

here c is a (p + 1)-form eld over a space-time x, l is a p-form sometimes called
the stuckelberg eld, and m is a constant. the action is invariant under the trans-
formations

and

c  c + da

l  l  ma

c  c

l  l + da .

(2.2)

(2.3)

in general these transformations remain symmetries of the theory, when e.g. da is
replaced by a closed form, say f . in this case, however, a is dened only locally.

in order to see what physical states there are one has to x the gauge. any
conguration (c, l) lies locally on the gauge orbit of (c + dl, 0). the l-eld is thus
not physical, and can be gauged away. in this gauge c is obviously a massive tensor
eld, the mass being given by the parameter m. one may ask what happens in the
theory when one takes the limit m  0. the two elds decouple, and the physics is
described by a massless tensor eld and a u(1) gauge theory. the physical hilbert
spaces of the theory are rather dierent depending on the value of m.

2.2 transition functions

physical states can generally be described as equivalence classes of elds modulo
symmetries. when we are building a theory on a topologically non-trivial space
we must rst cover the space (say, x) by a suitable collection of local charts {u}.
fields dened on dierent charts are related by symmetries of the theory  this means
simply that the actions of transition functions on dierent elds are given essentially
by gauge transformations. in this well known way e.g. tensor elds become sections
of (x, r).

a particular conguration is described so that one gives the (not yet gauge xed)
elds on each coordinate patch, and tells what gauge transformation g has to be
done on the intersection u  u to interpolate between dierent local descriptions.
for instance, in the example above we can take c  p+1(x, r) and set

c = g  c = c + da .

(2.4)

4

from this construction certain consistency conditions ensue. for example the

transition functions of a vector bundle must obey the cocycle condition

(g) = ggg = 1

(2.5)

on triple intersections of local charts. gluing the local theories together on a given
space is not always possible; obstructions to this are most conveniently discussed in
cech cohomology, cf. section 3.1.

let us apply this to the toy model of section 2.1: given an atlas u on the
space x we can dene a eld theory where elds on dierent patches are related
by the gauge transformations (2.2) and (2.3). the latter transformations suggest
for p = 1 an underlying line bundle l  x, provided the global extension of the
local form dl denes an integral cohomology class. this class characterizes the
topology of the bundle. the former gauge transformations have a similar action on
c. these transformations, however, have a peculiar action on the line bundle l; it
seems as if we could shift the characteristic class of the bundle l by a symmetry of
the theory. this suggests to consider structures where there are dierent line bundles
on dierent coordinate patches. these structures are most conveniently described in
terms of gerbes.

3. gerbes

as was in the case of the ambiguities introduced by gauge symmetries, even the
ambiguity in dening the right line bundles for stuckelberg elds can be turned into
an asset. in the same way that the former lead us to work with ber bundles, the
latter should lead us to consider gerbes. here we shall follow the lecture notes of
hitchin [2].

3.1 cech cohomology

let f = z2 or u(1) and assign to each n-fold intersection of local charts a map to f

fi1,,in : ui1     uin  f .

(3.1)

that is antisymmetric in its indices. then we can dene a coboundary operator by
setting

(f )i1,,in+1 = exp

n+1

xk=1

(1)k+1 log fi1,,k,,in+1

.

(3.2)

for example, the transition functions of an orthogonal or a unitary vector bundle
dene such functions for n = 2, namely f = det(g).

the cohomology h (x, f) of this complex, namely the cocycles (i.e. functions
that satisfy f = 0) modulo coboundaries (i.e. exact functions f = h), is called

5

cech cohomology. it characterizes the topology of the manifold and not only the
choice of cover, if the cover is ne enough [15]. for instance, the rst stiefelwhitney
class w1  h 1(x, z2) which is constructed using transition functions of a tangent
bundle is an obstruction to orientability. the second stiefelwhitney class w2 simi-
larly over z2 is constructed using lifts of these transition functions into the spin-cover.
a non-trivial w2 obstructs spin-structure.

3.2 denitions

a space x together with a collection of maps g as in (3.1) for n = 3 is called a
gerbe [2] if

(g) = 1 .

(3.3)

this is an obvious analogue of the condition (2.5). in the same way that a chern
class characterizes a line bundle, a class in h 3(x, z) characterizes a gerbe.

there is an equivalent but a somewhat more concrete denition of a gerbe that

makes use of local line bundles [2]. it postulates that there exist

1) a line bundle l on each intersection u  u.

2) an isomorphism l  l1
.

3) a trivialization  of

that satises () = 1.

l  l  l

(3.4)

the local trivialization of a gerbe on a two-fold intersection of local charts l is a
dierence of line bundles,

l = l  l1


.

(3.5)

this should be seen as an analogue of the observation that a dierence (quotient) of
two trivializations of a line bundle (i.e. non-zero sections) is an ordinary function. in
general it is possible to dene higher gerbes as dierences of lower gerbes; here we
shall only make use of the one-gerbes dened above.

3.3 connection

similarly to the curvature two-form of a line bundle that can be used to represent
the rst chern class, there is a three-form that can represent the characteristic class
of a gerbe. the three-form is constructed using a locally dened two-form gauge
potential b  2(u). the forms must satisfy the compatibility condition that the
dierence on a two-fold intersection u  u

b  b = f

(3.6)

6

be a curvature of a local line bundle. the curvature of the gerbe is then simply a
global three-form [g] = db  h 3(x, r). similarly to the chern class of a line
bundle, also the curvature of a gerbe must be in integral cohomology.

this is exactly the situation we encountered in the massive tensor theories: a
local two-form that can shift the characteristic class of a local line bundle by a
symmetry of the theory.

4. an ansatz in massive type iia

type iia string theory provides a physical example of a system, where the consid-
erations of the previous section are realized. there the mass parameter on the level
of supergravity [12] arises as the vacuum expectation value of the dual of a top-form
eld strength, cf. [16, 17]. furthermore, both of the equivalents of the elds c and l
turn out to carry charges associated to nonperturbative excitations in the full string
theory, namely ns5-branes and d6-branes. it is therefore necessary to understand
the spectrum in the m 6= 0 phase without going directly to the naive unitary gauge
l = 0.

below we shall present an ansatz, and show that it is consistent with all bianchi
identities and form-eld equations of motion. in section 6.2 we relate the t-dual of
the ansatz to a system of vebrane dyons in f-theory compactied on a calabiyau
three-fold.

4.1 the modied eld strength

let c be the free sum of rr elds. the modied eld strengths of type ii eld
theories are [18]

r(c) = dc  g  c + meb ,

(4.1)

where b is the ns two-form, g = db, and m the mass parameter of the type iia
theory. the bianchi identities are

dr(c)  g  r(c) = 0 .

(4.2)

the equations of motion follow from romans action [12], which in our notation is

s = z e2(  r + 4d  d 

1
2

g  g)



1
2

r(c)  r(c) +

1
2

d1(r[4]  r[4]  g)

(4.3)

the only non-trivial components of r[2k] being those for 2k = 0, 2, 4. dualizing in
the path integral leads to the dual eld strengths r[102k] = ()k  r[2k] as in [19].

7

let acp be the chanpaton gauge potential supported on the brane world-

volumes. then the rr form symmetry acts on the various elds according to [18]

rrc = d  g   + eb
rrb = 0

rracp = 0 .

the system possesses also a ns symmetry, namely

nsc = m eb
nsb = d

nsacp = 2 .

(4.4)

(4.5)

as explained above, when we build a twisted theory on a manifold it does not matter
what the exact values of c and b are. instead, the physical condition is that the
modied eld strengths r(c) and g be globally dened sections of (x). the rr
symmetry is the ordinary form symmetry in disguise. we can, again, allow d  f
to be cohomologously non-trivial. then the ns symmetry, for m 6= 0, changes the
chern classes or intersection numbers of the rr elds.

4.2 topology and rr elds

we consider an ansatz that supports ns5-brane, d6-brane and possibly d8-brane
charges in massive type iia theory. these congurations including their supersym-
metries have been discussed in a dierent context for example in [20, 21]. many
non-supersymmetric solutions of the massive type iia supergravity were constructed
already in ref. [12]. supersymmetric solutions include the d8-brane of [22] and [17].
other solutions were found in [19, 23].

in order to nd the relevant perturbative lagrangian we rst consider the bianchi
identities (4.2). it will turn out to be consistent to set c [3] = c [5] = 0 and to assume
b  b = 0. from the duality equations it then follows that

dc [7] =   (dc [1] + mb)

dc [9]  g  c [7] = m .

(4.6)

(4.7)

from (4.6), (4.7) and the fact that we shall be able to choose a b-eld that satises
b  b = 0 it follows that it is sucient to consider the action

s0 = z e2(  r + 4d  d 
r[8]  r[8] +z c [7]   ,

g  g)

(4.8)

where  is the poincare dual of the d6-brane. also the anomalous couplings should
be included, but it turns out that the equations of motion remain the same provided
tr(f  f  f ) = 0, where f = dacp.

8

consider1 a space-time locally of the form m 1,5  r  s3, and a xed point
p  s3. we cover the sphere with two hemispheres u0 and u1, so that the point p is
outside u0. let h satisfy

h = [v ]  2p  h 3(s3, z) ,

(4.9)

where [v ] is the de rham class of the volume form i.e. generator of h 3(s3, z), p is
the poincare dual of the point p, q is a parameter, and  = {d, d} is the hodgede
rham laplacian2. on the coordinate patch u1 we can similarly dene

h1 = [v ] .

(4.10)

for nding the three-forms h, h1 it was necessary that the relevant cohomology
classes on the right-hand side vanish.

we can now give our ansatz for the various form-elds. the ns two-form is

locally dened

the eld strength

b = (cid:26) q dh

q dh1

on u0
on u1

.

g = db = q [v ]

(4.11)

(4.12)

is globally dened. this ansatz supports q ns5-branes that are cut out of the origin
in r4\{0}  r  s3.

for generality we consider the mass parameter in romans supergravity as a

locally constant r-sheaf

m = (cid:26) m0

m1

on u0
on u1

.

(4.13)

this may lead to d8-brane charge. before introducing the metric the d8-brane is not
exactly localized. on the intersection of charts u0  u1 the charge is the dierence
in cosmological constants q(d8) = m1  m0.

as we are interested in bound states that involve d6-branes the correct electric
rr-form is c [7], whereas c [1] should be regarded as its magnetic dual. these are
naturally both gauge dependent objects, and the eld that we should match over the
intersections is r[8]. it is convenient to consider the dierence

f = (cid:16)dc [1](cid:17)1

(cid:16)dc [1](cid:17)0

= m0b0  m1b1

(4.14)

1the present ansatz makes use of a construction in [2].
2the hodge star  and the operator d refer to operations on s 3 and to the metric normalized

to r 1 = 2.

9

and to assume e.g. (dc [1])0 = 0. the d6-brane charge can be calculated integrating
over the charge density on a disc d  u1

zd

df = zd

(m0  m1) q v  2m0q p

= (m0  m1) q vol(s2)  2m0q .

(4.15)

(4.16)

let us now investigate the various eld strengths in detail: considering m0 = m1 =
m we only see the contribution coming from the extracted point. the physical
interpretation is that in that point a dirac string emerges through the sphere s3  r4
 this is just the d6-brane.

in order to see what happens if m0 6= m1 we should modify the above calculation
by setting h = [v ], which is possible locally on u0. the total ns eld strength is
globally dened; physically this means that we can with impunity put ns5-branes
inside a d8-brane. we can stretch the disc d over which integration is performed as
to cover all of the sphere but a point. in this limit the integral yields

zr3

df = 2 (m0  m1) q .

(4.17)

this means that there is a ux corresponding to (m0  m1)q d6-branes at the
excluded point. a similar phenomenon was observed in [21], where passing a ns5-
brane through a d8-brane produced a d6-brane tube between the ns5 and d8-
branes.

the two-fold intersection of charts u0  u1 is topologically a cylinder. we shall
nd it convenient to describe it as a line bundle  : c  s2 over a two-sphere. as
f is closed outside p we can write for concreteness

f =

mq

2

d cos   d ,

(4.18)

where (r, , ) are the local coordinates and we are suciently near p. as the formula
does not depend on r it descends naturally to a two-form on the sphere s2. further
away from p the formula depends on the details of the bration of c.
if we can
show that f is in integral cohomology we have constructed a gerbe. we defer this
discussion to section 4.3. the ux f is not dened far a way from p, but it is purely a
property of the cylinder intersection of the two charts. the gauge invariant physical
quantity is r[8] =   r[2]. on u0 we have r[2] = mb0. this actually extends to the
whole sphere as r[2] = mqdh. the electric eld strength is

r[8] =

mq

b

dh  vol(m 1,5  r),

(4.19)

where b is the conformal factor in front of the sphere metric in ten dimensions. the
function h satises

2h = 1  2(3)(p) .

(4.20)

10

the equation of motion is satised provided we insert the following six-brane source

 = mq (v  2 p) .

(4.21)

the d6-branes are supported in p and spread evenly over the sphere. the ns two-
form equation of motion reduces to ensuring that

e2 vol(m 1,5  r)

vol(s3)

(4.22)

does not depend on the coordinates of the sphere.

4.3 charge quantization

we want to interpret the non-gauge invariant two-form f as the curvature of a
suitable line bundle on the cylinder c : u0  u1  s2  r. if this can be done the
whole of the structure extends to a gerbe, as was explained in section 3. the bundle
we are looking for l01  s2 can be taken to have the same base space s2 as the
cylinder itself. the condition for l01 to be a globally on s2 dened line bundle is
that the curvature two-form be in integral cohomology

(cid:20) f
2(cid:21)  h 2(s2, z) .

(4.23)

as the factor vol(s2) in the formula for the ux (4.16) depends continuously on the
choice of d3, we are lead to the quantization conditions

m0 = m1
m0q  z .

(4.24)

(4.25)

the rst one implies that a d8-brane would separate gerbes from each other. the
cosmological constant m0 is quantized [18] because of the chernsimons terms in
the anomalous couplings. here this leads to a quantization of q as well.

without the help of gerbes it would be dicult to see how the d6-brane charge
should be quantized, or conserved, as the eld strength f is not globally dened, and
as its chern class can be changed by ns gauge transformations. here the quantiza-
tion follows from imposing the gerbe structure explained in section 3. conservation
follows from the fact that the ux arises from comparing two b-elds; even if the
b-elds are shifted by a non-trivial two-form in the cohomology of the three-sphere
(minus the point) the ux remains the same, provided m1 = m0. this is exactly the
condition that we stay inside a given gerbe.

the quantity that is invariant in eld theory is r[2]. in our example there are

no electric sources for this eld d  r[2] = 0, but

dr[2] = m0q (v  2p) .

(4.26)

11

this integrates to zero over the sphere, which just means that the sphere is able
to absorb the ux emanating from p. from the eld theory point of view this is a
consequence of the quadratic coupling between b and dc [1] that turns ux into the
b-eld [13, 14]. the closest parallel to this is the anomalous coupling between the
chanpaton eld strength and the rr potentials. there will be a net ux out of
the sphere only if it is placed on top of the d8-brane, where the ux can ow.

the ux of g emanates from the origin where there is a source. except exactly
at the d6-brane this ux turns into the charge density of r[2] implying a monopole
distribution spread evenly over the sphere. of course once we embed the sphere in
r4 the density falls o with the distance from the ns5-branes. the physical sources
in string theory are the d6-branes with which one associates the locally dened beam
of ux f through the point p.

5. t-duals in type iib

massive type iia solutions can be related to type iib solutions using a scherk
schwarz compactication, where the compact coordinate z  s1 has period lb. ap-
plying t-duality on the d6-brane world-volume of the congurations in sec. 4.2 and
using the massive t-duality rules of [17, 24] yields3

c [0] =  + mz
c [2] =  c [0]q  dh + j [2] ,

where  is the vacuum expectation value and the current j [2] satises

dj [2] = 2 q c [0] p .

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

the exact forms of c [6] and c [8] depend on the (yet unknown) metric.

notice in passing that restricting to the branes i : m 1,5  x the pull-backs

i[g] = 0 vanish, and any spinc-manifold m 1,5 satises the consistency condition

i[h] = w + [d]

(5.4)

for a brane to wrap on it as it is stated in [25]. here h = hns, hrr, [d] is the
poincare dual of the (here absent) boundary of a three-brane ending on the ns5/d5-
brane, and w is some characteristic class constructed naturally out of the topology
of the brane. most notably it could be (w2), where  : h 2(x, z2)  h 3(x, z) is
the bockstein homomorphism  or possibly the characteristic class of the brane, if it
happens to be a gerbe cf. sec. 7.

3the hodge star refers again to the metric on s 3 with volume 2.

the eight-form charge signals the presence of d7-brane sources cf. sec. 6.2. if the
bounding sphere s3 here is the same as the one in the iia picture we obtain the
ns5-branes we started from.

let us show now that it is possible to choose the topology in such a way that
a non-zero ux could be captured by some other three-surface than the previously
used s3. we could choose this surface to be a circle bundle  : m 3  s3  s2
with the same base manifold s2 we used for the cylinder  : c  s2. the ber will
be the isometry direction s1. above, we got a generator of h 2(s2, z) by pushing
forward d(h  h1) by . this is the poincare dual of the ber of the cylinder
bundle, and only well dened in c. let us now choose a section of the cylinder
bundle i : s2  c. the form idh is again proportional to the generator of
h 2(s2) and carries information about the choice of bration. we can pull this form
back to m 3 using . assuming that h 1(m 3) = 0 any closed one-form is exact,
and idh = d(h + v) where v is an arbitrary closed vertical form. there is
indeed a eld that we should associate with the vertical form, namely v = dc [0].
these choices of the components of h,v carry information about how the isometry
direction s1  z is embedded in m 3. the d5-brane charge turns out to be related
to the linking number (hopf invariant)

5.2 topology of the ansatz

let us recapitulate the construction thus far.
in type iia the conguration was
described in terms of a gerbe. we were considering a system that included ns5-
branes, and locally dened d6-branes that ended in the ns5-branes. if there was a
compact isometry direction in the world-volume of the d6-brane we could t-dualize
the system. we considered, for simplicity, a dual system with parallel ns5-branes
and d5-branes. it turned out that the d6-brane ux could get entangled with the
isometry direction in such a way as to produce d5-brane charge in addition to the
previously found ns5-brane charge. hopf invariants classify knots on s3 so that, in
a sense, we have tied the type iia d6-brane into a knot on the type iib side.

the obtained geometry, though maybe convoluted if described as above, is not
unfamiliar. we may combine the isometry circle and the ber of the cylinder c into
another cylinder c   the transverse space has then the structure of a cylinder bundle
over a sphere, where the cylinder c  is the ber and the sphere is the usual base space.
this space can then be related to an elliptically over a sphere bered four-manifold
with a singular ber. furthermore, there is d7-brane charge, which implies a decit
angle in the iib metric. this charge is associated to a world-volume which is obtained
from the d6-brane m(d6) modding out by isometries s1, and adding the sphere
that has been serving us as a base manifold, or as m(d7) = (m(d6)  m 3)/s1. in
section 6.2 we shall use global consistency conditions to patch these local descriptions
together and relate the geometry of the system to an f-theory compactication.

6. generalizations

the construction can be naturally generalized for a nite set of extracted points

p = {p|  i}  s3 ,

(6.1)

by just repeating the above procedure for each point separately. one then obtains for
each   i a pair of sets u 
1 = qdh 
1
in an obvious generalization of section 4.2. we now have to ensure that the arising
line bundles on each two-fold intersection obey the condition (3.4).

0 = qdh  and b

0 and u 

1 . let us dene b

the open neighborhoods of the xed points can be chosen so that they do not

intersect. we shall have to consider the following intersections of local charts

a) for intersections u 
the chern class was

1 u 

0 nothing new happens, and we get the bundles l(p).

m(b

0  b

1 ) = qm p = c1(cid:16)l(p)(cid:17) ,

(6.2)

where p stands for the (properly normalized) two-form in (4.18).

14

b) on u 

0  u 

0 we call the bundle l. this intersection is again topologically a

cylinder (three-sphere minus 2 points), and one nds

m(b

0  b

0 ) = qm (p  p) .

the chern class is hence the dierence of the separate chern classes

c1(cid:16)l(cid:17) = c1(cid:16)l()(cid:17)  c1(cid:16)l()(cid:17) .

c) the last cases to dene are the intersections u 

0  u 

1 . now we get

m(b

1  b

0 ) = qm p = c1(cid:16)l(p)(cid:17) .
0  u 

0 we observe

on the triple intersection u 

1  u 

c1(l(p)) + c1(l) + c1(l(p)) = 0 ,

which means that the product bundle

l(p)  l  l(p)

is indeed trivial.

irrespective of the number of points the characteristic class is

[h] = q[v ]  h 3(x, z) .

(6.3)

(6.4)

(6.5)

(6.6)

(6.7)

(6.8)

notice also that base spaces of the line bundles cannot be described as simple em-
beddings into space-time. they are entirely properties of the two-fold intersections
and hence,
in a sense, mutually non-local. the gerbe manages to describe the
topology of the space s3\p; in our case it is merely a catalog of the various non-
trivial two-cocycles in h 2(s3\p, z). this geometric picture is similar to that in
e.g. refs. [26, 27].

6.1 consistency and f-theory on a calabiyau three-fold

in addition to verifying the equations of motion, which is a local statement of the
stability of the system, we should also consider global consistency.
in particular,
due to the decit angle found above it is not consistent to consider only one point
p = {p}. we should also take care that the system is at rest, which amounts to
picking the points in the set p where the ux comes out of the sphere in a symmetric
way. it follows that some discrete subgroup  of so(4) should act as permutations
in p. the system will therefore look as if the ns5-branes were put on the top of an
orbifold singularity in the origin  the gauge theory on its world-volume is therefore
the one described in [28, 29].

15

locally in type iib the transverse space will then look for  = zn like a taub
nut space. in e.g. [30] the b eld was set proportional to the self-dual harmonic
two form of the taubnut space, the deformations of which contributed to the
number of zero modes that were needed in completing the dyon spectrum. this
provides a type iib interpretation for the ubiquitous factor vol(s2) that appeared in
various charges. in our construction it characterized the choice of the base manifold
s2  s3 using which we tie the sphere s3 together with the compact direction in the
scherkschwarz compactication.

6.2 geometry of the ansatz

in section 5.2 we saw that the congurations that support the dyonic vebrane
charges have an elliptically over a sphere bered transverse space, and that there is
d7-brane charge. above we found that a stable solution should be invariant under .
we have now to patch these local cylinder bundles together in a way that guarantees
the consistency of the global metric. all of this is rather suggestive of an orbifold limit
of a k3 compactication. related congurations have been studied e.g. in [13, 31, 32].
a smooth type iib compactication on a k3 is, however, not the right answer as
it would have twice as much supersymmetry as the original ns5/d6-brane system
in type iia. instead, we shall somehow have to take into account the vebranes
that have been put in the orbifold singularity in order to break the supersymmetry
properly to a quarter of the full type iib supersymmetry.

let us consider for a moment the type iib system without the vebranes. the
fact that our system involves an axion that depends on the coordinates of the elliptic
ber was just a consequence of the scherkschwarz reduction. on the other hand,
any scherkschwarz compactication of type iib on a circle can be formulated as
an f-theory compactication on a torus bundle over that circle [33]. in particular,
an f-theory solution with the same supersymmetry, a monodromy around the d7-
branes/orientifolds that shifts the axion, and the same weak coupling orbifold limit
of a k3 singularity was already obtained in [34, 35, 36]: the compactication there
was an elliptically over cp 1  cp 1 bered calabiyau three-fold that reduced in ten
dimensions in weak coupling to type iib theory on k3  m 1,5/()fl     in the
notation of [36].

compactication on k3 and orientifolding by ()fl     both break supersym-
metry by a half, so that in the end we have the right amount of it. the fact that the
third cohomology group of a k3 vanishes reects the fact that we must put the ve-
brane dyons in the orbifold singularities of the k3. also the third cohomology group
of cp 1  cp 1 vanishes. we see that the dyon charges should arise from topologi-
cal winding numbers only on the level of the full calabiyau three-fold whose third
cohomology is non-trivial. we conclude that we have found at least a candidate for
an f-theory compactication that in type iib gives rise to the right rr charges and

16

the right ns5-brane charge. we interpret this as an f-theory argument for, even if
not a proof of, the consistency of the dilaton and the graviton equations of motion4.

7. k-theory classication of branes

it has been suggested in [6, 7] and further elaborated in [8, 9, 10] that k-theory
of the world-volume of the brane classify d-brane charges. the mapping from the
brane into the pertinent k-theory class [7] uses the normal bundle of the embedded
submanifold, which should have a spinc-structure. a non-trivial w  h 3(z, z)
obstructs such a structure, and it follows from the consistency condition (5.4) that
the the pull-back of the ns three-form eld strengths vanish.

this situation was generalized to the class of congurations involving a ns eld
in this case one was lead
strength that is purely torsion in integral cohomology.
to consider the k-theory of twisted bundles [7]: these are bundles whose transition
functions do not necessarily satisfy (2.5) but instead

(g) = h ,

(7.1)

where  is the obstruction to spinc-structure and h is the lift of [g] from
h 3(x, z) to h 2(x, u(1)). these objects are trivial gerbes.

7.1 branes ending on branes

what does happen then, when the restriction of [g] does not vanish on the brane?
this leads one to consider branes ending on branes [7]. the world-volume theory
will then contain couplings of the form c  dl of section 2.1 (cf. [13, 14]) and the
present considerations are applicable.

the consistent treatment of the world-volume theory involves gerbes along the
lines of the construction in section 4.2, and the characteristic class represented by
the three-form eld strength [g] is, again, that of the gerbe on the brane. in the
present construction the identication of the ns three-form eld strength as the
characteristic class of the gerbe motivates the point of view that the ns three-form
incorporates all the topological information of the system  thus including a possible
obstruction to spin-structure. this leads us too look upon the consistency condition
(5.4) as saying that the left-hand side i[g] + w , which characterizes the intrinsic
topology of the brane whose world-volume theory we are looking at must equal the
right-hand side [d], which are the sources. the natural way to write the consistency
equation in the form topology equals matter is then

4notice, however, that orientifolding imposes restrictions on the two-form potentials.

i[g] = [d] .

(7.2)

17

this condition is the direct generalization of the formula of electrodynamics stating
that the chern class of a maxwell bundle equals the class that characterizes the dirac
string

[f ] = [2string] .

(7.3)

conversely, the obstruction for wrapping a brane on a cycle should be the character-
istic class of the gerbe on the cycle.

7.2 classication in type iia

the type iia theory presents a couple of problems in the direct application of k-
theory: the transverse space has odd dimension, and the analysis in [7] for type
iib has no obvious analogue. also, the branes to which the cosmological constant
m should naively couple are not submanifolds of space-time  after all their world-
volume should have dimension 1. nevertheless string theory tells us [16] to treat the
cosmological constant m = r[0] on equal footing with any other rr eld strength.
finally, on the level of type iia supergravity the two-form ux is not gauge invariant
and it is only dened locally, as we have seen in the previous sections.
instead,
the classication group of type iia d-brane charges has been suggested in [7] to be
k 1(x). in [8] this picture was realized by building supersymmetric d-branes starting
from non-supersymmetric d9-branes.

the appearance of gerbe solutions calls for an extension of the classication to
something that should be the k-theory of gerbes. however, as the complications
on the type iia side are connected with the appearance of the mass parameter,
in some cases a straightforward cure is simply to t-dualize the congurations to
type iib theory, where all eld strengths couple to geometric objects. this is of
course only possible in the congurations that posses at least one compact isometry
direction needed to perform t-duality, and will not circumvent the issues that arise
in general ns two-form backgrounds. the features that were in iia understood as
consequences of having a cosmological constant then turn into characteristics of a
scherkschwarz compactication with respect to a coordinate whose period is related
to the type iia mass parameter. classication of type iia d-branes wrapping on
a submanifold z should be done in terms of the pertinent group on the type iib
side, namely k(z  s1), or some modication thereof, where s1 is the circle with
respect to which the duality transformation was performed. note that the circle
may lie also on the d-brane world-volume, in which case one might be compelled
to consider k(z/s1). as in [7] these considerations seem to point towards the only
other available independent k-theory group, namely k 1(z).

8. summary

in this article we have investigated some applications of gerbes in string theory and

18

supergravity. we showed how these inherently nonlocal constructions appear natu-
rally in theories that involve massive tensor elds analogously to how ber bundles
appear whenever there is a gauge symmetry. we used this insight in analyzing the
ns5/d6-brane systems that appear in massive type iia supergravity. this leads to
quantization conditions that, in particular, relate the cosmological constant to the
ns5-brane charge. the d8-branes were interpreted as domain-walls between gerbes.
we then proceeded to look for the equivalent t-dual systems on the type iib side.
the dual branes were the ns5-brane and d5-brane dyons. because the used mas-
sive t-duality involved a non-trivial scherkschwarz compactication the axion eld
became non-trivial, and carried d7-brane charge related to the iia cosmological con-
stant. the system was identied as an f-theory compactication on an elliptically
bered calabiyau three-fold.

these considerations imply foremost that gerbes are a natural part of string
theory. the immediate reason for their appearance on the type iia side was the
zero-form rr eld strength, i.e. the cosmological constant. the fact that the corre-
sponding string theory objects would be 1-dimensional renders a direct k-theory
classication of d-brane charges dicult on the type iia side. a straightforward
method to nd the classication groups for type iia is then to look at the t-dual
objects on the iib side. we also considered wittens consistency conditions for brane
wrapping and found that they are closely related to gerbe structures. indeed, the in-
tegral cohomology class of the ns three-form should be interpreted as a characteristic
class of a gerbe.

we are now in position to use gerbe structures to study nonlocal phenomena, such
as branes on orbifold singularities in type iib. this picture should also prove useful
in classifying d-brane charges in the presence of non-trivial ns two-form background.
it would also be interesting to see what implications these constructions might have
on the spectrum of m-theory.
