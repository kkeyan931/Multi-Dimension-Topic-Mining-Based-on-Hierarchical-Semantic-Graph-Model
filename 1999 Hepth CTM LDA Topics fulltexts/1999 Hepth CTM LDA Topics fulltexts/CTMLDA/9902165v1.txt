abstract

we propose a lattice version of chern-simons gravity and show that the
partition function coincides with ponzano-regge model and the action leads
to the chern-simons gravity in the continuum limit. the action is explicitly
constructed by lattice dreibein and spin connection and is shown to be in-
variant under lattice local lorentz transformation and gauge dieomorphism.
the action includes the constraint which can be interpreted as a gauge xing
condition of the lattice gauge dieomorphism.

1 introduction

it is not obvious that the string is the only formulation leading to the quantum grav-

ity. in fact, two dimensional quantum gravity was formulated by a lattice gravity,

the dynamical triangulation of random surface. on the other hand, three dimen-

sional einstein gravity was successfully formulated by the chern-simons action even

at the quantum level[1]. it is natural but nontrivial expectation that the three di-

mensional gravity will be formulated on the lattice. in particular it is natural to ask

how one can formulate the chern-simons gravity on the lattice.

ponzano and regge (p-r) proposed a 3-dimensional lattice gravity model based

on 6-j symbols[2] about 30 years ago. at the early 90s turaev and viro (t-v)

proposed q-deformed version of the p-r model[3] and then turaev pointed out that

the partition function of the t-v model is the square of the partition function of

su(2) chern-simons gauge theory which is equivalent to the palatini action with

a cosmological term[4][5]. on the other hand ooguri and sasakura showed that

the p-r model is equivalent to the iso(3) chern-simons theory[5]. they showed

the equivalence by using the wave function of wheeler-dewitt equation and the

knowledge of conformal eld theory. the proof is, however, indirect.

there is also another indirect approach to show the equivalence of the p-r model

and chern-simons gravity. vanishing curvature condition is the equation of motion

of the chern-simons gravity and can be used to derive 6-j symbol via orthogonality

of character[6][7][8]. thus the equivalence is on the classical level.

apart from these development two of the present authors (kawamoto and nielsen)

proposed a gravity version of wilsons lattice gauge theory[9] where the plaquette

action plays a fundamental role. there was an independent proposal[10] similar to

ours.

in this paper we extend the formulation previously proposed by the authors and

explicitly construct a lattice chern-simons gravity by identifying the location of

dreibein and spin connection on a simplicial lattice manifold. after the integration

of the dreibein and spin connection, we obtain the ponzano-regge model. we clarify

the lattice version of local lorentz transformation and the gauge dieomorphism.

we then give arguments that the lattice action leads to the chern-simons action in

1

the continuum limit.

the standard chern-simons action is formulated by one form gauge eld and

zero form gauge parameter. since the three dimensional chern-simons gravity is

formulated only by forms, the general coordinate dieomorphism invariance of the

action is trivial and should be reected on the lattice. the standard chern-simons

action has been generalized into arbitrary dimensions[11] by introducing all the

possible form degrees.

it has been analysed that the two and four dimensional

generalized chern-simons actions lead to a two dimensional topological gravity and

four dimensional topological conformal gravity,respectively, at the classical level[12].

one of the important aim of the current analysis of the lattice chern-simons gravity

is to extend the formulation given here into other dimensions including four by using

the generalized chern-simons actions.

2 brief summary of chern-simons gravity and

ponzano-regge model

2.1 chern-simons gravity

we rst summarize the chern-simons gravity formulated by witten[1]. we choose

the gauge group as euclidean version of three dimensional poincare group iso(3).

then we dene one form gauge eld and zero form gauge parameter as

a = ea

pa + a

ja,

v = apa +  aja,

(2.1)

where ea

 and a

 are dreibein and spin connection, respectively, and  and  are
the corresponding gauge parameters. the momentum generator pa and the angular

momentum generator ja of iso(3) satisfy

[ja, jb] = abcj c,

[ja, pb] = abcp c,

[pa, pb] = 0.

(2.2)

using the invariant quadratic form which is particular in three dimensions, we can

dene the inner product

hja, pbi = ab,

hja, jbi = hpa, pbi = 0.

(2.3)

2

we then obtain einstein-hilbert action of three dimensional gravity from chern-

simons action

where

z dada +

2
3

a3e = z eaf a

 d3x,

f a
 = a

  a

 + a

bcb

c
.

the component wise gauge transformation of a = dv is given by

ea

a

 = da  abcebc,
 = d a.

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

at this stage it is important to recognize that the local lorentz transformation is

generated by the gauge parameter 

ea

a

 = abcebc,
 = d a,

(2.7)

while the gauge transformation of dieomorphism is generated by the gauge param-

eter 

ea

a

 = da,
 = 0.

(2.8)

three dimensional einstein gravity is thus elegantly formulated by chern-simons

action. this is essentially related to the fact that the three dimensional einstein

gravity does not include dynamical graviton and thus can be formulated by the

topological chern-simons action. the equivalence of the above action and einstein-

hilbert action is, however, valid only if the dreibein ea

 is invertible. the quantiza-
tion and perturbative renormalizability around the nonphysical classical background

ea
 = 0 is the natural consequence of the formulation.

it has been pointed out that iso(3) chern-simons gravity action is equivalent

to the palatini action for three dimensional gravity, which is essentially the three

dimensional version of bf theory[13]. in bf theory b is a one form on the three
dimensional manifold taking values in l
manifold taking values in lg, where l
case l

g and f is a curvature two form on the
g is the dual algebra of lg. in the present
g  lg coincides with the lie algebra of iso(3) group. due to the algebraic

dual nature of b and f , the gauge transformations of the palatini action include the

same gauge transformations (2.7) and (2.8) as iso(3) chern-simons gauge theory.

2.2 ponzano-regge model

ponzano and regge noticed that angular momenta of 6-j symbol can be identied as

link lengths of a tetrahedron. in particular they showed the following approximate

relation:

(1)p6

i=1

ji( j1 j2 j3

j4 j5 j6 ) 

1

12v

cos(cid:18)sregge +



4(cid:19) (all ji  1),

(2.9)

where sregge is the regge action of regge calculus[14] for a tetrahedron having
link length jk (k = 1  6) which correspond to the angular momentum of the
corresponding 6-j symbol and v is the volume of the tetrahedron. based on this

observation they proposed the following partition function:

zpr = lim

 xj yvertices

()1 yedges

(2j + 1) ytetrahedra

j4 j5 j6 ) .
(1)p ji( j1 j2 j3

(2.10)

thus the partition function zpr is the product of the partition function of each

tetrahedron which reproduces the cosine of the regge action in contrast with the

exponential of the regge action in regge calculus. there is an argument about

the origin of the cosine, that right and left handed contributions of the general

4

coordinate frames contribute separately and thus the summation of the exponential

with the dierent sign factor for the regge action appears.

it is thus natural to

expect that this action leads to a gravity action.

important characteristic of the ponzano-regge action is that it has a topological

nature on a simplicial manifold. the action is invariant under the following 2-3

and 1-4 alexander moves. the 2-3 and 1-4 moves are related to the following 6-j

relations:

i=1

(1)k+p9
xk
= ( j3 j4 j5
j6 j1 j2 )( j3 j4 j5

ji(2k + 1)( j1 j8 k
j9 j8 j7 ) ,

j7 j2 j3 )( j7 j2 k

j6 j9 j4 )( j6 j9 k
j8 j1 j5 )

(2.11)

and

xki " 4
(2ki + 1)# (1)p ki()1( j1 j2 j3
yi=1

( j3 j4 j5

k4 k2 k1 )( j1 j5 j6

k1 k2 k3 )( j4 j6 j2
k3 k1 k4 )
k4 k3 k2 ) = (1)p ji( j1 j2 j3

j4 j5 j6 ) . (2.12)

the geometrical correspondence of 2-3 and 1-4 moves with two tetrahedra into three

tetrahedra and one tetrahedron into four tetrahedra is obvious from fig.2. in the

formula of 1-4 move there appears the following innite sum which is then introduced

as a regularization factor in the denominator with a cuto :

() =

1

2j1 + 1

xk2, k3  ,

(2k2 + 1)(2k3 + 1)

|k2  k3|  j1  k2 + k3



=

(2j + 1)2 

xj=0

43
3

(  ).

(2.13)

it is known that these two alexander moves reproduce any three dimensional

simplicial manifold. thus the partition function zpr is invariant under the variation

of metric and is expected to be topological.

in this paper we show that the continuum limit of the lattice ponzano-regge

model leads to the chern-simons gravity by explicitly constructing lattice gauge

gravity model.

3 lattice chern-simons gravity action

we consider a three-dimensional piece-wise linear simplicial manifold which is com-

posed of tetrahedra. in 3-dimensional regge calculus curvature is concentrated on

the links of tetrahedra. we intend to formulate a lattice gravity theory in terms

of gauge variables, dreibein e and spin connection . in analogy with the lattice

gauge theory where link variables surrounding a plaquette induce a gauge curvature,
it was proposed in [9] and [10] that dual link variables u(l) = e(l) located at the
boundary of a dual plaquette p (l   p (l)) associated to an original link l induce
the curvature of the gravity theory. it was further pointed out that the dreibein

ea(l) is located on the original link l.

we propose to use a lattice version of chern-simons action, which is a modied

version of the one in [9], and show that the length of dreibein e(l) is naturally

discretized. in the chern-simons formulation, the dreibein ea and spin connection

ab are lie algebra valued gauge elds. for a moment we consider a euclidean

version of three-dimensional local lorentz group so(3) and discuss su(2) case

figure 3: dual link variables on  p

later.

here we slightly modify the formulation given above in order that each tetrahe-

dron gets independent contribution to the partition function and at the same time

the orientability could be naturally accommodated. we divide the dual link, which

connects the centers of neighbouring tetrahedra, into two links by the center of mass

of the common triangle of the neighbouring tetrahedra. we may keep to use the

terminology of dual plaquette and dual link even for those modied plaquettes and

links. correspondingly we put dierent link variables u for the doubled dual links.

we then assign the directions of u-links inward for each tetrahedron as shown in

fig.3.

using these variables, we consider the following lattice version of chern-simons

action on the simplicial manifold,

slcs = xl

abcea(l)hln y p (l)

(cid:13) uibc

,

(3.1)

where,  p (l) is a boundary of the p (l), which is a (dual) plaquette around the link
(cid:13) u denotes the product of u(l) along  p (l). we dene the curvature
l, and y p (l)

7

f ab(l) of the link l by the following equation,

(cid:13) uiab
h y p (l)

 hef (l)iab

.

(3.2)

the leading term of f with respect to the lattice unit is the ordinary curvature
d +    similar to the ordinary lattice gauge theory.

it is the unusual point of this action (3.1) that we have taken logarithm of the
wilson loop u along  p (l) to extract the curvature. because of this logarithm,

however, this action has several nice features. firstly, this action itself is already

hermitian in contrast with the ordinary lattice gauge theory due to the hermiticity

of lie algebra valued curvature. secondly, as we show in the following, the length

of dreibein e is discretized as a natural consequence of the logarithm.

classically the chern-simons action impose a torsion free condition as an equa-

tion of motion. the torsion free nature is lost at the quantum level since we integrate

out the dreibein and spin connection. we now introduce the following vanishing

holonomy constraint which relates the dreibein and spin connection even at the

quantum level:

(cid:13) uiab
h y p (l)

eb = ea.

(3.3)

the dreibein ea associated to a original link may be parallel transported around the
boundary of the dual plaquette  p (l) to the original location and yet the direction

of the dreibein should not be changed. we may interpret this constraint as a gauge

xing condition of gauge dieomorphism symmetry which we will explain later. due

to the constraint the group so(3) becomes eectively abelian, i.e. the direction

of the rotation associated with the curvature is parallel to that of ea. this can be

seen as follows: we can reduce the above constraint to the following one:

f abeb = 0,

(3.4)

2abcf bc is parallel to ea: ea  f a.

hence f a  1
(cid:13) uiab

the h y p (l)

here we should reconsider the constraint (3.3). firstly it should be noted that

is an element of so(3) and thus the eigenvalue equation of this ele-

ment always has eigenvalue +1. thus the number of the independent constraints

8

in eq.(3.3) is not three but two. taking into account the parallel and anti-parallel

nature of ea and f a in the constraint, we can rewrite the correct constraint equation

e3

|e| " 2
ya=1

  f a
|f|

+

ea

|e|! +

2

ya=1

  f a
|f| 

ea

|e|!# ,

(3.5)

where |e| and |f| are length of ea and f a, respectively. the coecient factor e3
|e| is
necessary to keep the rotational invariance of the constraint relation, which can be

easily checked by polar coordinate expression of the constraint relation.

now we show that discreteness of the length of the dreibein |e| comes out as a
natural consequence of the specic choice of the lattice gauge gravity action. we

rst introduce the following normalized matrix i,

i  i aja,

i a 

f a

f afa

,

(3.6)

here [ja]bc = iabc is the generator of so(3). this matrix satises the following

relation,

then

eii = 1  i 2(1  cos ) + ii sin ,

ei2ni = 1, n  z.

(3.7)

(3.8)

using the above relation and f a  ea by the constraint (3.3), we nd that our lattice
chern-simons action slcs has the following ambiguity:

abcea(l)hln ef (l)ibc
abcea(l)hln ef (l)+i2niibc
[2ea(l)fa(l) + 4n|e(l)|]

slcs = xl
= xl
= xl
= slcs +xl

4n|e(l)|,

here |e| is the length of ea, |e|  eaea. this ambiguity leads to an ambiguity in

the partition function

z = z dude eislcs = z dude eislcs+ipl 4n|e|.

(3.9)

9

imposing the single valuedness of eislcs, we obtain the constraint that pl 2|e(l)|
should be integer, or equivalently |e(l)| should be half integer.

in the above arguments we have restricted the dual link variables to so(3). if

we extend the arguments to su(2) the discrete nature of the dreibein is modied

as follows. first of all we need to use the triplet representation of su(2) for the

dual link variables since the sux of the color variable should vary from 1 to 3 to be

compatible with our lattice chern-simons action (3.1). we may then use the same

generators of so(3), [ja]bc = iabc, for the triplet representation of su(2). this

representation is, however, not faithful (injective).

in other words an element of

the triplet representation used by those generators and the corresponding element

of su(2) is not one to one but one to two correspondent. due to this degeneracy of

the representation the periodicity relation (3.8) for su(2) should be modied to

ei4ni = 1, n  z.

(3.10)

accordingly we need to modify factor 2 in the corresponding relations in the above,
i.e., 4|e(l)| should be substituted for 2|e(l)| in su(2) case.

4 gauge invariance on the lattice

the gauge transformations of the continuum chern-simons gravity have been given

by (2.6) which includes the local lorentz gauge transformation (2.7) and the gauge

transformation of dieomorphism (2.8). we rst note that the dreibein and the

curvature dened in (2.5) transform adjointly under the local lorentz gauge trans-

formation

ea
 = abcebc,
 = abcf b
c.

f a

(4.1)

we consider the lattice version of the local lorentz gauge parameters are sitting

on the dual sites and the middle of the original links, the same point of the dreibein.

for simplicity we consider here in this section that the dual link is not divided

into two dual links by the center of original triangle. then the dual link variable
u(l) = e(l) transforms under the lattice local lorentz transformation as

u(l)  v 1u(l)v ,

10

(4.2)

where the gauge parameters v and v  are elements of so(3) and located at the end
points of dual link l. dening the matrix form of the dreibein by ecb
 (l) = abcea(l),

we can rewrite the lattice chern-simons action (3.1) by

slcs = xl

tr(e(l)f (l)),

.

(4.3)

where f (l)ab = hln y p (l)

(cid:13) uiab

corresponding to the continuum local lorentz transformation, we can dene the

lattice version of local lorentz transformation of e(l) and f (l) according to (4.2)

e(l)  v 1e(l)v,
f (l)  v 1f (l)v.

(4.4)

it is obvious that the lattice chern-simons action (4.3) is invariant under the lattice

local lorentz transformation.

there are, however, some subtleties on the gauge invariance of the lattice action.

in dening the lattice curvature f (l)ab = hln y p (l)
and ending dual site of the product y p (l)
(cid:13) u to dene the lattice curvature. see fig.3.
we then need to bridge between the dual site and the center of the original link of
e(l) by new link variables u and u 1. the action associated with this particular

, we need to choose a starting

(cid:13) uiab

dual plaquette is

tr(cid:16)e(l) uhln y p (l)

(cid:13) ui u 1(cid:17) = tr(cid:16)v 1e(l)v v 1 uv v 1hln y p (l)

(cid:13) uiv v 1 u 1v(cid:17)

 tr(cid:16)e(l)hln y p (l)

(cid:13) u i(cid:17).

(4.5)

then the newly introduced link variable transforms similar as the dual link variable
u  v 1 uv , where v and v  are located on the the center of the original link and
the dual site, respectively. we can, however, use one of the gauge parameters, say the
one at center of the original link, v 1, to tune in such a way that this link variable
leads to a trivial factor u  v 1 u v   1. we then redene the matrix form of the
dreibein v 1e(l)v = e(l) and the curvature v 1hln y p (l)
(cid:13) u . we can

(cid:13) uiv  = ln y p (l)

thus gauge away the variable u . this can be allowed since we have enough gauge

parameters on the dual sites and on the original links because of the geometrical

reason that our simplicial manifold is constructed out of tetrahedra. we can now

identify the nal expression of (4.5) as the one in (4.3). accepting this arguments

we have conrmed that our lattice chern-simons action is invariant under lattice

local lorentz transformation.

the continuum chern-simons gravity action is invariant under the gauge trans-

nection a

formation of dieomorphism (2.8) which transforms dreibein ea

 but not spin con-
. we try to identify the lattice counter part of this gauge transformation
and show the gauge invariance. the gauge invariance of the continuum action by

the gauge dieomorphism (2.8) can be shown by using bianchi identity. here we

rst formulate the lattice version of integrated bianchi identity

(4.6)

for a three dimensional simplicial manifold randomly constructed from tetrahe-

dra, several original links could be connected to an original site. since an original
link l is dual to the corresponding dual plaquette p (l), an original site is surrounded

12

by dual plaquettes which topologically construct s2 sphere. in general the sphere

could take arbitrary shape. for simplicity we here assume that the sphere is a

tetrahedron. in this case the original site is in the center of the tetrahedron and

the triangles of the tetrahedron are the dual plaquettes. dual link variables uk
(k = 1  6) are located on the dual links, the edges of the tetrahedron, where
the directions of the dual link variables can be arbitrarily chosen. original links lk
(k = 1  4) are sticking from the center through the triangles. see fig.4.

we rst note the following identity:

y u  u2u4u 1

3 u3u5u 1

1 u1u6u 1

2 u2u 1

6 u 1

5 u 1

4 u 1

2 = 1.

we now dene

ln(u2u4u 1
ln(u1u6u 1

2 ) = f3,

ln(u3u5u 1
5 u 1

6 u 1

1 ) = f2,
4 u 1

ln(u2u 1

2 ) = f 
4.

due to the baker-hausdor formula the above relations lead

here we have dened irregular lattice curvature f 

4 which has u2 and u 1

in the

product of dual link variables. this type of irregular denition is unavoidable in

deriving lattice bianchi identity due to the geometrical reason leading to the type

of identity of (4.7). we can then identify

we notice that [k, fk] term is the integrand in the volume integration. k should

13

thus be dened as an average spin connection inside the dual volume, the tetrahedron

in the present case. since the curvature itself could be interpreted as an average spin

connection on a dual plaquette, the k dened in (4.11) is the particular average

of the curvature and thus can be interpreted as the average spin connection in the

dual volume with respect to fk.

we now show the lattice gauge dieomorphism invariance of the lattice chern-

simons action (4.3). we rst consider the term related to the fourth link l4 and

make local lorentz transformation

(4.12)

tr(cid:16)e(l4)f (l4)(cid:17) = tr(cid:16)v 1e(l4)v v 1f (l4)v(cid:17)

 tr(cid:16)e(l4)u2f (l4)u 1
6 u 1

5 u 1

2 (cid:17) = tr(cid:16)e(l4)f (l4)(cid:17),

4 ). here we take the gauge choice v = u 1

where f (l4)  f4 = ln(u 1
and
further redene v 1e(l4)v = e(l4), we obtain the nal expression. from now on
we identify e(l4) = e(l4). in this way we can introduce the unusual denition of
the curvature f 
4 of (4.8) in the lattice chern-simons action. hereafter we rename
f 

2

4 as f4.

the lattice version of the gauge transformation of dieomorphism (2.8) can be

given by using the k dened above

ek(lk) = k + 0  [k, 0],
where k is the matrix gauge parameter, (k)ab  bacc
k.

(4.13)

then the lattice gauge transformation of dieomorphism for the lattice action

(4.3) leads

slcs = xl

tr(cid:16)e(l)f (l)(cid:17)

xk=1

due to the bianchi identity (4.10). here we have used the following relation:

tr(cid:16)[k, 0]fk(cid:17) = tr(cid:16)0[k, fk](cid:17).

14

(4.14)

(4.15)

we have thus completed the proof of the invariance of the lattice chern-simons

action under the lattice gauge transformation of dieomorphism.

we now point out that the constraint (3.3) or equivalently (3.4) breaks the lattice

gauge dieomorphism while the lattice chern-simons action itself is invariant, as

is shown above. the lattice dreibein is transformed but the lattice curvature is

not transformed under the lattice gauge transformation of the dieomorphism. the

precise expression of the constraint (3.5) tells us that the dreibein ea can be rotated

by using two gauge parameters of the gauge transformation of dieomorphism to be

parallel or anti-parallel to the curvature f a. the length of the dreibein is discretized

and thus the third gauge parameter can be exhausted. in this sense we can identify

the equivalent constraint, (3.3), (3.4), (3.5) as a gauge xing condition of the lattice

gauge transformation of dieomorphism.

5 calculation of partition function

in the previous section we have found that the length of dreibein is discretized to half

integer for so(3) and a quarter for su(2). to be specic we restrict our arguments

for so(3) for a moment. in order to accommodate the discrete nature of the length

of the dreibein, we rst note an identity

constraints without changing the value of the partition function.

due to the rotational invariance of the constraints, we can take e3 as the third

this calculation is not precise, because the summation is not convergent. we need

to show that there is a regularization procedure which leads to a validity of the

above calculation after the regularization.

we propose to use the heat kernel regularization. we rst consider the following

heat equation:

 k(u, u ; t) =


t

k(u, u ; t),

lim
t0

k(u, u ; t) = (u, u ),

(5.6)

16

where the laplacian is dened on the group manifold, k(u, u ; t) is the heat kernel
and (u, u ) is the delta function. then the regularized character will be given by

j (u; t) = z du j (u )k(u, u ; t).

(5.7)

all these quantities are dened on the group manifold so(3). in particular the

laplacian on the group manifold will be related in general to the 2nd casimir oper-

ator, the square of the angular momentum in case of so(3). hence the character of

spin-j representation j , which is essentially the trace of the matrix representation,
is the eigenfunction of the laplacian with the eigen value j(j + 1),

 j = j(j + 1)j .

noting the completeness of the character

(u, u ) = xj

j (u)j (u ),

we can immediately obtain the heat kernel solution

(5.8)

(5.9)

k(u, u ; t) = xj

ej(j+1)tj (u)j (u ).

(5.10)

substituting the heat kernel solution into (5.7) and using the orthogonality of the

character,

we obtain an explicit form of regularized character

z dui(u)j (u) = ij ,

j (u; t) = ej(j+1)tj (u).

the summation is now convergent and should be replaced by

zl = xj

j 2(j  j1)
j 2(j ej(j+1)t  j1e(j1)j t),

which leads to the regularized result

(5.12)

zl =

(2j + 1)j ej(j+1)t.

it is interesting to note that this link partition function coincides with the heat-

kernel lattice gauge theory action but the interpretations and the origin of the terms
are quite dierent[6][7][15]. this regularization factor ej(j+1)t breaks the alexan-

der invariance of the partition function but it will be recovered at the end of the
calculation when we take the limit t  0.

one of the remarkable points of this result is that the factor 2j + 1 has appeared

in the link partition function zl, which is the same and necessary factor for the

p-r model to assure the alexander invariance. another important point is that

the character has appeared after the ea integration, which makes u integration

straightforward.

5.2

u integration

after ea integration and dividing the unimportant constant factor ql(1/8), the

partition function leads

z = z du yl



xj=0

(2j + 1) j(cid:16) y p (l)

(cid:13) u(cid:17) ej(j+1)t,

(5.14)

where we take t  0 limit in the end of calculation. we now carry out du integra-
tion of this partition function. thanks to the character of the partition function,

du integration is straightforward. we show that the ponzano-regge partition func-

tion will be reproduced after du integration with 6-j symbols together with correct

coecients and sign factors.

before getting into the details we gure out how 6-j symbols appear. the char-

acter in the partition function is a product of d-function around the boundary of

dual plaquette associated to a original link. each tetrahedron has six original links

and there are two dual links which is a part of a product on the boundary of the dual

plaquette associated to each original link. in other words three dual links associated

to a du integration thrust into each triangle from the center of the tetrahedron.

therefore twelve dual links are associated to a tetrahedron. each du integration of

the product of three d-function reproduces two 3-j symbols, thus we get eight 3-j

symbols for each tetrahedron. four out of eight 3-j symbols lead to a 6-j symbol

and the rest of four 3-j symbols lead to give trivial factor together with the 3-j

figure 5: dual links related to neighbouring tetrahedra and the orientability

we rst note that the character appearing in the partition function is a product

where ui is a dual link variables on the boundary of dual plaquette p (l) associated
to a link l and mi is the third component of angular momentum j which is assigned

to the link l. as we have already pointed out that the direction of ui for each

link is dened inward for each tetrahedron. on the other hand the direction of the

loop composed of the product of dual links associated to the link l can be chosen
arbitrarily. therefore some of ui in the above d-functions are u 
i . if the original
link l is a link of a particular tetrahedron, two d-functions out of the above product

are located inside the tetrahedron.

we now choose a particular situation which is shown in fig.5. the twelve d-

functions associated to this particular tetrahedron are

here we are considering so(3) case then the third component of the angular
momentum mi is integer and thus we can use the relation ()mi = ()mi which
is not correct if mi is half integer in case of su(2). we now look at the rest of the

3-j symbols in eq.(5.20) which carry the suces i, j, k, l. as we can see from fig.5

that du1 integration reproduces two 3-j symbols and one of them associated to

the suces mk is absorbed to reproduce the 6-j symbol and the other 3-j carrying
the suces ik could be combined with another 3-j symbol obtained from du 

1 inte-
grations of the neighbouring tetrahedron. those 3-j symbols are associated to the

boundary triangle of the two neighbouring tetrahedron carrying sux ik. in this

particular case of fig.5 we obtain the following two 3-j symbols

i b

i = xi1i2i3

()i1+i2+i3   j1 j2 j3

i1 i2 i3 !  j1 j2 j3

i1 i2 i3 ! .

since the three angular momentum vectors j1, j2, j3 construct the boundary trian-
gle, the third components satisfy the relation i1  i2  i3 = 0. using the following
formula:

xm1m2m3  j1 j2 j3

m1 m2 m3 !  j1 j2 j3

m1 m2 m3 ! = 1,

(5.21)

and noting ()i1+i2+i3 = ()i1i2i3 = 1 for so(3) case, these two 3-j symbols lead
to a trivial factor.

it should be pointed out here that the above factor reproduces a negative sign
if ik is half integer in case of su(2) since ()i1+i2+i3 = ()2i1()i1+i2+i3 = 1.
some of negative sign factors can be removed by using the triangle relation and
()m1i1 = ()m1+i1, which holds even for half integer values since m1 and i1 are
both the third components of j1. we cannot, however, get rid of all the negative sign

21

factors for the dual link loop associated to the original link in this way. therefore

we need to point out that there appear oating negative sign factors for su(2) case.

finally we have found that our partition function is the same as that of the
j=0(2j + 1)2.
since our partition function is divergent with the same reason, we should introduce

ponzano-regge model, except for the regularization factor () = p

the same regularization factor as the p-r model.

which exactly coincides with the ponzano-regge model after the integration of the

dreibein and the dual link variables. the discreteness of the length of the dreibein

is the natural consequence of the logarithm form in the lattice chern-simons action.

on the simplicial lattice manifold constructed from tetrahedra, the dreibeins are

located on the original links while the lattice version of the spin connection, the

dual link variables are located on the dual links. we have explicitly shown that the

lattice chern-simons action is invariant under the lattice version of local lorentz

transformation and the lattice gauge dieomorphism. in order to get the topological

gravity theory at the quantum level, we need a constraint which solves the spin

connection as a function of the dreibein. we have found the constraint which can

be interpreted as the gauge xing condition of the lattice gauge dieomorphism.

since the ponzano-regge model is invariant under the 2-3 and 1-4 alexander

moves, the partition function is invariant under how the three dimensional space is

divided into small pieces by tetrahedra. it is natural to expect that the partition

function is invariant in the continuum limit and the lattice chern-simons action

leads to the continuum chern-simons action.

it is interesting to note that the algebraic dual nature of the one forms e and 

in the bf theory or equivalently in the palatini action, is reected on the geometric

22

dual nature of e and u = e on the lattice. in other words, e and  are dened in
the lie algebra l
g and lg are dual to each other
with g = so(3) and l
g  lg = iso(3)[13]. the one form e and the link variable
u = e are dened on a original links and dual links, respectively, and thus the dual

g and lg, respectively, where l

nature of the algebra is reected in the geometry on the lattice.

in the iso(3) lattice chern-simons action there are 6 gauge parameters. two

gauge parameters of the lattice gauge dieomorphism can be used to rotate the

dreibein ea to be parallel or anti-parallel to the curvature f a and the remaining

one gauge parameter of the lattice gauge dieomorphism can be exhausted to make

the length of the dreibein discrete. there remain three gauge parameters of the

lattice local lorentz gauge symmetry, which are expected to convert into the three

vector parameters of general coordinate dieomorphism symmetry. there are two

reasons to expect this scenario. firstly the lattice action coincides with the ponzano-

regge model which is alexander move invariant and is thus expected to be metric

independent.

in fact the lattice chern-simons action in the continuum limit is

metric independent since it is composed of one form. secondly the general coordinate

transformation of dieomorphism and the local lorentz transformation are on shell

equivalent in the continuum iso(3) chern-simons gravity[1].

in this paper we have concentrated on the relation between the iso(3) chern-

simons gravity and ponzano-regge model. the q-deformed ponzano-regge model

proposed by turaev and viro[3] is expected to be related with so(4) or so(3, 1)

chern-simons gauge theory and lead to einstein gravity with a cosmological term[1][5].

it is thus natural to extend the present formulation into the lattice gauge gravity

with cosmological term and try to nd the connection with the q-deformed version

of ponzano-regge model. there are already several trials on these directions[17][18]

but our lattice formulation may give new insights.

since our lattice gauge gravity formulation of the present paper has natural

correspondence with the regge calculus[9], it is expected that the extension to four

dimension is straightforward and is expected to be related with the bf gravity

theory which has 15-j interpretation[19]. as in the present formulation the area of

the triangle will be discretized in four dimensional lattice gauge gravity theory[20].

23

it will be interesting to extend the current formulation into the lattice version of

generalized chern-simons gravity. the three dimensional generalized chern-simons

action includes not only one form gauge eld but also zero, two and three form gauge

elds[11]. it will be interesting to ask what the role of other form gauge elds is.

it should also be noted that the four dimensional generalized chern-simons action

includes bf term together with several other terms which include zero, one, two,

three, and four forms.
