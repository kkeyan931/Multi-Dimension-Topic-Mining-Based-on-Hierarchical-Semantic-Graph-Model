in this short note, we would like to show simple mechanisms, how
from action for non-bps dp brane proposed by sen we can simply obtain
action describing supersymmetric d(p-1) brane in iia theory.

1 introduction

in the last year, many new results about d branes in string theories have
emerged. in the remarkable series of paper by sen [5, 6, 12, 13, 14] the problem
of nonsupersymmetric conguration in string theories has been studied.
it is
clear, that non bps d branes in iia, iib theories are as important as super-
symmetric ones. on the other hand it is known, that non bps are not stable,
so they can decay into supersymmetric string vacuum, which is a consequence
of tachyon eld, that lives on world-volume of non-bps brane. but presence of
non-bps brane in the string theory is important from one reason. we can con-
struct on the world-volume of non-bps brane kink solution of tachyonic eld,
which forms d brane of dimension smaller than original non bps brane, and
this solution can be stable from topological reason (for a review of this subject,
see [4, 2] ). witten generalised this construction and showed, that all branes in
iib theory can be constructed as topological defects in space-time lling world-
volume of d9 branes and d9 antibranes [7]. horava extended this construction
to the case of iia theory and showed, that all branes in iia theory can emerge
as topological solutions in space-time lling non bps d9 branes . horava also
proposed an intriguing conjecture about matrix theory and construction of d0
branes in k theory [8, 15]. for review of the subject d branes and k theory,
see [10], where many references can be found.

in recent paper, sen [1] proposed an supersymmetric action for non -bps
d branes. because non -bps branes break all supersymmetries, it seams to be
strange to construct supersymmetric action describing this brane. but when
we remember, that this brane moves in supersymmetric world or iia or iib
theory, this action certainly could be possible. sen showed, that this action has
to contain the full number of fermionic zero modes (32), because this non-bps
d brane breaks completely supersymmetry. on the other hand, bps brane
contain 16 zero modes because breaks one half of supersymmetry. sen showed
that this action has origin in supersymmetric action describing bps d brane.
this action is manifestly symmetric under all space-time supersymmetries. sen
argued, that ordinary action for bps brane contain dbi term and wz term,
which are invariant under supersymmetry but only when they both are in the
action for d brane, the action is invariant under local symmetry on brane, 
symmetry, that is needed for gauging away one half of fermionic degrees of
freedom, so that on bps brane only 16 physical fermionic elds live, as should
be for bps brane. sen showed, that dbi term for non- bps brane is exactly
the same as dbi term in action of bps brane (when we suppose, that other
massive elds are integrated out, including tachyon) that is invariant under
sypersymmetric transformations, but has no a  symmetry, so that number of
fermionic degrees of freedom is 32, as should be for nonsupersymmetric d brane.
sen also showed, how we could include the tachyonic eld into action. be-
cause mass of tachyon is of order of string scale, there is not any systematic
way to construct this eective action for tachyon, but sen proposed an general
form of the term containing interaction between tachyon and other light elds
on world-volume of non-bps brane. this term has a useful property, that for

1

constant tachyon eld, this term is zero, so that the action for non-bps vanishes
identically, so we end with supersymmetric vacuum.

in next section, we would like to extend this construction to the situation,
when all massless elds living on world-volume of non-bps brane in iia theory
vary slowly, and when we suppose trivial background coming from closed string
sector, which means, that background metric is at and b eld is zero. (we will
not discuss issue with nonzero b eld leading to the noncommutative geometry
[16]). then we can expand dbi action and we obtain action for ym term
and action for left and right handed fermions on d brane. now we start to
construct function describing interaction tachyon with massless elds. we will
show, that in case of kink solution of tachyonic eld, we must set one half of
fermionic elds to zero and as sen argued [1], action reduces to the action for
supersymmetric d brane. in the limit of zero size we can construct an action for
supersymmetric d brane of dimension smaller than the original brane, which
can correctly reproduce general arguments of [5, 7, 8]. when we also use the
results of [17] we obtain action for bps brane .

in conclusion, we will discuss other problems with non-bps brane and rela-

tion of this construction to the k theory.

2 action for non-bps brane in iia theory

we start this section with recapitulating basic facts about non-bps branes in
iia theory, following [1]. let ,  = 0, ...p are world-volume co-ordinates on d
brane. fields, living on this d brane arise as the lightest states from spectrum
of open string ending on this brane. this open strings have two cp sectors [6]:
rst, with unit 2  2 matrix, which corresponds to the states of open string with
usual gso projection (1)f |i = |i where f is world-sheet fermion number
and |i is state from hilbert space of open string living on dp brane. the
second cp sector has cp matrix 1 and contain states having opposite gso
projection (1)f |i =  |i. the massless elds living on dp brane are ten
components of x m (), m = 0...9, u(1) gauge eld a() and 32 component
of fermionic eld  transforming as majorana spinor under transverse lorenz
group so(9, 1). we can write  as sum of left handed majorana-weyl spinor
and right handed majorana-weyl spinor

 = l + r, 11l = l, 11r = r

(1)

all elds except r comes from cp sector with identity matrix, and r comes
from sector with 1 matrix.

as sen [1] argued, action of non bps d brane should go to the action of
bps brane, when we set r = 0 (we have opposite convention that [1] ). from
this reason, action of non-bps brane in [1] has been constructed as supersym-
metric dbi action, which is manifestly supersymmetric invariant, but has not
 symmetry, so we cannot gauge away one half of fermionic degrees of freedom,
so that this action describes non-bps brane. in the following, we will not need

2

the general form of this action, because to obtain kink solution on their world-
volume, which can be interpreted as d(p-1) brane, we must xing gauge, so we
should work in static gauge:

s = cz dp+1q det(g + f )

g + f =  + ijij + f
2l( + i i)l  2r( + ii) r +
+(lm l)(lm l + rm  r) +
+(rm r)(lm l + rm r)

(2)

where f = a  a is a eld strength for gauge eld and c is constant
equal to the dp brane tension (we work in units ls = 1) .

now if we set r = 0, we obtain action for bps d brane as in ref. [18].
the next thing is to include the eect of tachyon.

in order to get some
relation between tachyon condensation and supersymmetric branes, we would
like to have an eective action for massless eld and tachyon living on world-
volume of non-bps brane. this eective action should appear after integrating
out all massive modes of open string ending on dp brane. because tachyon
mass is of order of string scale, there is no systematic way to obtain eective
action for this eld but we can still study some general properties of this action.
following ref.[1], the eective action for non-bps dp brane with tachyonic eld
on its world-volume should have a form:

s = z dp+1qdet(g + f )f (t, t, dt, ... g

a , g

s ) + iw z (3)

where g
a , s are symbols introduced in [16], which are appropriate quantities
for open string in presence of general background arising in closed string sector.
in this note, we are interested in the simplest case, where metric is at and b
eld is zero, so this quantities can be taken to be trivial.

in the function f the constant c is included , so that for t = 0, f = c
and we obtain action for non-bps d brane (2). this function has a important
property [1], that for tachyon eld t = t0, this function is zero:

f (t0) = 0

(4)

2 we also have iw z = 0 due to the fact, that wz term has a form for non-bps
dp brane [17]:

iw z = czp+1

c  dt  e2f +b  g

(5)

2in fact, in [1] was argued, that in case of constant t , f reduces to the potential for tachyon
and as a consequence of general form of potential for tachyon, this term is zero for t = t0.
in this article, we slighty change behaviour of this function, becouse we only demand, that
in point on world-volume, where tachyon is equal its vacuum value t0, we should recover
supersymetric vacuum, so that there are no elds living on non-bps brane, so we have (4).

3

where g is geometrical part of wz term, but in our case we take normal and
tangent bundles to be trivial, so this term is trivial as well. we see, that for
t = const., this terms is zero. when on the whole world-volume the tachyon
is equal its vacuum value t0 (recall, that vacuum value of elds is the value,
that minimise potential for this eld), the action is identical zero and we end
with pure supersymmetric vacuum, which is satisfactory result, because we ex-
pect, that after tachyon condensation, non-bps brane disappears and we obtain
supersymmetric vacuum.

now we are interested in nontrivial behaviour of tachyon on world-volume
of non-bps brane.
in other words, we would like to construct kink solution
for tachyon. as was explained elsewhere [5, 8], when we have one non-bps
brane, tachyon eld must be real and consequently there is no coupling between
tachyon and gauge eld living on world-volume of non-bps d brane. it can be
shown [5, 6], that potential for tachyon must be even function of t, so that we
have two values of t, that minimise potential for tachyon. in other words, we
have two ground(vacuum) states for tachyon eld : {t0, t0} 3.

to have contact with construction of supersymmetric d brane as topological
solution on world-volume of non-bps brane, we expect, that massless eld living
on non-bps brane are slowly varying, so that we can expand dbi action in
standard form, when derivatives of massless elds are small, so we obtain action
for u(1) gauge eld and massless scalars i, i = p + 1, ...9 describing transverse
uctuations of brane, as in ordinary construction of bps branes [19, 20]. there
are also terms for fermionic elds r, l so that action has a form

s = z dp+1(f f  + 2ijij + f.t.)f (t, t...) + iw z

(6)

where f.t. means term containing both left handed and right handed fermionic
elds r, l. we need not to know direct form of this term, we only must know,
that in case of r = 0 and t = 0, this action goes into gauge xed action for
bps dp brane.

now we would like to construct kink solution for the tachyon eld. this
means, that we must solve equation of motion for tachyon, which can be ob-
tained from (6). because tachyon is present only in f function, we can obtain
equation of motion for tachyon from this function. in the next part we must
determine on some physical grounds form of this function with interaction terms
between tachyon and other massless elds, which must be present in this func-
tion, because as in ref.[1], when we set t=0, we must obtain action for non-bps
brane.

we write f as

f = c(v (t ) + g(t, r, l))

(7)

where v(t) is potential for tachyon and in g we have included kinetic term
for tachyon and all interaction terms between tachyon and spinor elds and we

3to see, why tachyon is real, we must consider general case of n non-bps branes, where
tachyon must be in adjoin representation of u (n ) gauge group [8] . because u(1) has no adjoin
representation, tachyon eld is real eld with charge zero. this has important consequence in
construction f function in (3).

4

have used the fact, that tachyon has charge zero with respect of gauge eld a.
for the same reason there is no interaction term between tachyon and scalar
eld i, because we know, that non-bps dp brane transform under t duality
into non-bps d(p1) brane, which results into transformation of component of
gauge eld in direction of t transformation into scalar eld describing position
of t dual d(p-1) brane in dual direction, and because tachyon has no charge
with respect to gauge eld, we can conclude, that there is also no interaction
between tachyon and scalar eld(we have at metric and b=0, so that we have
no interaction between tachyon and light elds coming from closed string sector).
now we must discuss possible form of g function. we know from previous
discussion, that l comes from cp sector with identity matrix and r comes
from cp sector with 1. as we know, open string amplitudes comes with factor
containing trace of cp matrix. interaction vertex with two fermionic lines and k
tachyon lines contain following trace (we are interested only in terms with two
fermionic elds without derivatives, because interaction with more fermionic
elds and with more derivatives do not give new information):

tr((1)k11)

(8)

where rst term correspond to the tachyon, the second to l and the third
to r. from the identity tr(2n+1
) = 0 it is clear, that k must be odd. we
dont know the exaxt form of interaction between tachyon and spinor elds, but
the simplest term has to have a form with one eld from left handed sector and
one eld from right handed sector and one tachyon:

1

g(t, r, l) = t rl  t t

(9)

, where we take only terms with two derivatives of tachyon into g. we believe,
that higher terms in interaction do not spoil our result.

now, we are ready to construct kink solution on non-bps brane. we sup-
pose, that tachyon is function only one co-ordinate, say x1. firstly, we should
ask what happen, when t is equal one of vacuum expectation value in one par-
ticular point. we know, that f in (6) must be zero in this point, because we
should obtain pure supersymmetric vacuum here:

f = c(v (t0) + t0rl = 0

(10)

, because v (t0) is zero and t = t0 is nonzero, the only possibility is to take
either r or l to be zero and we choose r = 0 in point, where t = t0. we
must also mention, that other elds are not restricted in this particular point.
in kink solution, tachyon approaches in limit x1   one vacuum value
(say t0) and then in limit x1   the vacuum value t = t0. we can
take special limit of this solution, when tachyon is dierent from its vacuum
expectation value t0 only in small region around point x1 = 0 and in extreme
case, we take t to have a form:

t (x1) = (cid:26) t0,

t0 x1 > 0

x1 < 0

(11)

5

of course, this is very special function and there could be some opinions, why
we do not take terms with higher derivatives into g, but we expect, that these
terms make behaviour of our solution more singular, so that in any case, f looks
like f  (x1)(this can be seen from the fact, that potential term in (10) is nite
function and singular behaviour comes from derivative term). now from (9) we
can obtain the equation of motion for tachyon

d2t
dx2
1

+ rl +

dv
dt

= 0

(12)

dt  (x1) and dt 2

we know, that dv (t )
dx2 is singular as well, but because delta
function is even function, this function is odd, so that we expect, that these
two terms cancel among themselves, we can conclude, that in order to satisfy
equation of motion for tachyon, we must demand, that r is zero in x1 = 0 as
well.

r = 0

(13)

this result is with agreement with our original assumption, that massless
elds vary slowly on world-volume of non-bps brane, because in case of non-
trivial dependence of r on x1, its derivative would by proportional to the delta
function and then r certainly does not vary slowly on world-volume of non-bps
brane.

we know, that in extreme case (11), we have

f (x1)  c(x1)

(14)

and when we insert this term into (6), we obtain action for (p-1) dimensional
brane 4, but there are two puzzles, which must be resolved. firstly, when we
insert (14) into (6), we also obtain following terms

x1|x1=0

, where  is any massless world-volume eld. but we know, that there is no
dependence of any eld in resulting (p-1) dimensional action on x1, so we must
demand, that this term is zero.

x1|x1=0 = 0

(15)

the other problem arises with scalars describing transverse uctuation of d
brane. any dp brane has (9-p) world-volume scalars describing uctuation of
this brane in transverse directions. original non-bps action has (9-p) scalar
elds, but now we have action for (p-1) brane, so that there should be (10-
p) scalars. we can obtain this additional scalar from gauge eld. remember,

4we must remember, that we are working in units ls = 1, so that tension of dp is (
c  1/g ), but when we would work in units, where ls is not one , than integral over x1 would
be multiplied with ls , so we would obtain tension for d(p-1) brane as t  cls 



1
glp

s

ls
+1
s

gl

which is a correct tension for d(p-1) brane

6

that in original action we have had a term (now m, n goes from 0...p and
,  = 0...p  1 ):

fm n f m n = 2f1f 1 + f f 

(16)

we see, that additional scalar can be rst component of gauge eld a1, that

has kinetic term

2f1f 1 = 2a1a1

(17)

, which is the same as term for scalar elds in (6), so that after renaming
a1 = p, we obtain (10-p) scalars which is a correct number for d(p-1) brane.
from previous facts and from (13) we conclude, that kink solution on non-
bps dp brane forms bps d(p-1) brane, that is localised in x1 direction. this
can be also conrmed with wz term [17], that in extreme case has a form
(dt (x1) = (x1)dx1)

iw z = zp

c  e2f

(18)

which has the same form as wz term for bps dp brane.

3 conclusion

in previous part we have obtained kink solution of tachyon on world-volume
of non-bps dp brane in iia theory and we have shown, that this solution
really describes bps d(p-1) brane in iia theory, which is in agreement with
[5, 7, 8] and in some sense can serve as further support of their results. we have
obtained this result only in the simplest case of interaction between tachyon and
fermionic elds, but we believe, that higher terms in potential do not spoil this
result, but the question remains open. (but from general argument of [7, 8],
this solution should exist, so that seams to us, that this simple calculation could
lead to correct result.)

the next step in this work is to extend this analysis to the case of non-bps
in iib theory . the other problem is relation between action for non-bps brane
in iia theory and k theory proposed in ref.[8]. in this construction, all d branes
arises as topological solitons on world-volume of space-time lling non-bps d9
branes with appropriate gauge group.
it would be interesting to extend our
analysis to the case of non-abelian gauge group on world-volume of non-bps d
brane, following [8], and then possibly to the case of non-bps d9 brane.
