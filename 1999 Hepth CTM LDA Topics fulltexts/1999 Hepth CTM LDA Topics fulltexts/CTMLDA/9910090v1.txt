abstract

we consider heterotic string compactications to four dimensions when instantons
shrink to zero size.
if the standard model gauge group originates from the new
gauge symmetry associated with the small instantons singularity, then the weakly
or strongly coupled heterotic string scales can be taken to be arbitrarily low. the
so(32) and e8e8 gauge groups can then be very weakly coupled even at the string
scale and behave as non-abelian global symmetries. we comment on a possible role
of small instantons in supersymmetry breaking.

1 introduction

the string scale, compactication scale, and planck scale and the relations between them,
are of great importance for understanding the dynamics of string theory and its phe-
nomenological applications. these relations depend strongly on the choice of the string
vacuum [1]. in this note we consider heterotic string compactications to four dimensions
when instantons shrink to zero size [2, 3, 4] in weakly and strongly coupled [5] limits
of heterotic strings. we discuss some aspects of the resulting four-dimensional n = 1
supersymmetric gauge theories.

one of the main aims of our study is to illustrate how the heterotic string scale can
be made arbitrarily low. lowering the compactication scale [6], the string scale [7] and
quantum gravity scale [8] to tev or to intermediate energies [9, 10] allows new perspectives
on phenomenological applications of string theory. it was argued that this is possible for
type i string theory in [11], for the horavawitten compactications of m-theory in [9]
and for type ii string theory in [12] (see also [13]).

the paper is organized as follows. in the next section we will briey discuss heterotic
string compactication. in section 3 we will consider the singularities when so(32) in-
stantons shrink to zero size and discuss phenomenological aspects of the four-dimensional
n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories. we show that if the standard model gauge group
originates from the new gauge symmetry associated with the small instantons singularity,
then both the weakly and strongly coupled heterotic string scales can be taken to be
arbitrarily low. the so(32) gauge group can be very weakly coupled even at the string
scale and play the role of a non-abelian global symmetry. in section 4 we will consider
the singularities when e8  e8 instantons shrink to zero size. we comment on a possible
role of the small instantons in supersymmetry breaking.

2 heterotic string compactication

consider e8  e8 and the so(32) heterotic string theory with a tendimensional string
coupling h = exp(h) and a string scale lh. at low energies the eective tendimensional
description is in terms of a super yang-mills theory coupled to supergravity. the ten
dimensional gauge coupling g10 and the gravitational coupling 10 are

we will be interested in a compactication of weakly coupled heterotic string theory on
a calabiyau 3-fold. concretely, we will consider calabiyau 3-folds of the form of a k3

bration over a p 1 base. the four-dimensional gravitational coupling 4 is related to the
newton constant gn

4 = 8gn . the latter is given by

below we ignore the model dependence arising from the factor f and take f = 1. these
lead to:

h = 4

as is clear from (2.4), requiring a gauge coupling h of order 1 implies that lh is of
order lp. in [14] it was suggested to use one-loopmodied relations with the inclusion
of threshold correction due to d large dimensions with size r. in such a case, while h
governs the strength of gravitational interactions, the gauge interaction are governed by:

(2.5)

with c a constant containing the beta-function coecient. we see that for large lh a
coupling of order 1 is obtained if the denominator is correspondingly small. here r is
bounded to be smaller than  tev1 and d = 1, 2 for the supersymmetric case and up to
6 for the non-supersymmetric case. this leads roughly to bounds of a string scale higher
than  1011 gev in the rst case and  107 gev in the second one.

in the following we use the fact that (2.3) does not apply to gauge sectors of weakly
coupled heterotic string that do not descend from the ten-dimensional so(32) or e8 
e8 gauge groups. such gauge sectors arise from singularities in the moduli space of
the compactication where extra massless particles are present and there is an extra
gauge symmetry. we will consider the enhanced gauge symmetries associated with the
singularities when so(32) 2 or e8  e8 instantons shrink to zero size. this phenomenon
cannot be seen in the conformal eld theory description, but can be seen at a weakly
coupled heterotic string description.

3 so(32) small instantons

consider rst the case of the weakly coupled so(32) heterotic string theory compactied
on a k3 bration over a p 1 base. we will work in the adiabatic limit of a large p 1
base, which simplies the discussion but is not essential. in this limit we can use a local
description as a compactication to six dimensions on the k3 bre. in order to specify
a compactication of the heterotic string on a manifold m, we have to choose a gauge
bundle v . one requirement from the compactication is that

1
2

p1(v ) =

1
2

p1(m) ,

(3.1)

where p1 is the rst pontryagin number. for k3 it means that we have to choose the
gauge bundle to have instanton number 24. witten argued [2] that at the singularity,
associated with a collapse of k instantons at the same point in k3, a new sp(k) gauge
symmetry appears. in addition massless hypermultiplets appear. they consist of (32, 2k)
of the so(32)  sp(k) gauge group and a massless hypermultiplet in the antisymmetric
representation of sp(k), which is a singlet of so(32).

the gauge coupling of the new gauge group is dierent from the so(32) gauge cou-
pling. in order to determine the new gauge coupling it is useful to consider the dual picture
of the instantons collapse in type i string theory at strong coupling. the analogue in the
type i picture of the collapse of k instantons at the same point is k coinciding ve-branes.
the enhanced gauge group is the ve-branes world-volume gauge group and the mass-
less hypermultiplets are the matter content of the world-volume gauge theory. they are
obtained by analysing the zero modes of the open strings attached to the d5-branes [2].
the six-dimensional sp(k) gauge coupling is g2
i , where i = exp(i) is the
ten-dimensional type i string coupling and li is the type i string scale. the duality map
i = hl2
l2
between type i string theory and the heterotic string theory is i = 1/h,
h.
thus, the six-dimensional gauge coupling of the small instanton sector at the heterotic
side is given by g2

d5 = (2)3il2

si = (2)3l2
h .

we would now like to reduce the six dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory
on the p 1 and obtain a four-dimensional n = 1 gauge theory. on the type i side this
means wrapping the d5 branes on the base p 1. the spectrum of the four-dimensional
theory can be obtained as in [15]. here we have to to take into account the non-trivial
bration of the bre k3 over the base p 1, which leads to a twist of the dirac operator on
p 1. the reduction preserves one covariantly constant spinor, yielding n = 1 supersym-
metry in four dimensions. the sp(k) vector elds survive the reduction as well as some
of the six-dimensional matter hypermultiplets. for instance when k = 1, sp(1)  su(2)

3

the 32 hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of the su(2) gauge group give
rise to four doublets in four dimensions [15].

the four-dimensional gauge coupling reads

sp =

(3.2)

where vp 1 is the volume of the base. the conguration where one identies the stan-
dard model gauge group with the small instantons gauge sector will allow us to consider
arbitrary low heterotic so(32) string scale.

there are three dimensionless expansion parameters in the system that we require to
be small in order for the weakly coupled description to be valid. the rst is the expansion
parameter of the perturbative string description in ten dimensions 2

let us now analyse these conditions for the validity of the weakly coupled description.

we can view the weakness of gravitational interactions as arising either from a large
k3 volume or from a very small string coupling constant. for instance, taking sp  1/10
as a rough estimate, the rst possibility arises, with a choice:

the above discussion is valid till the gauge coupling (3.2) is large sp  l2

and we cannot trust a perturbative analysis. passing to the dual type i description is

not useful either, since at these energies the heterotic so(32) gauge coupling so = 4 l2

l2
h
is still weak and therefore the so(32) gauge coupling on the type i side is large. at this
energy scale the system in no longer four-dimensional and we probe the physics of six
dimensions.

if h is chosen to be very small, at energies below the string scale, the unbroken part
of the so(32) symmetry is very weakly coupled and it is seen from the sp(k) side as a
non-abelian global symmetry. such kinds of symmetries can be useful for phenomeno-
logical issues such as forbidding operators that could lead to proton decay or other exotic
processes. on the other hand the gravitational interactions are still weak at the string
scale. the main experimental signature would be the observation of eects due to the
kaluzaklein modes of p 1. if one instead explains the weakness of gravitational inter-
actions by a large k3 volume (as in type i scenarios) then at energies of order l1
h the
so(32) symmetry coupling is of the same order as the one of sp(k) and cannot be viewed
as a global symmetry. this is due to the sum of the contributions from the kaluzaklein
states propagating in the k3. moreover at the string scale the gravitational interactions
are now of the same strength as the gauge ones.

a large class of models with various gauge groups and matter content for which the
above discussion continues to hold can be obtained by shrinking instantons at ade singu-
larities of k3 [17]. on the type i side these models are obtained by placing the ve-branes
at these singular points [18, 19]. in these models the gauge groups are products of the
classical gauge groups qi,j,k so(ni)sp(mj)u(lk) arranged according to quiver (moose)
diagrams related to the extended dynkin diagrams of the ade groups.

finally we note that instead of a compactication on the base p 1, we can reduce to
four dimensions on two circles with non-trivial boundary conditions on the circles. this
leads to n = 0 gauge theories in four dimensions. the above discussion continues to hold
at energies e  1/r, where r is the radius of the circles. at higher energies we will
probe these two compact coordinates, by producing the associated kaluzaklein states.

4 e8  e8 small instantons

consider now the case of e8 e8 heterotic string compactied on a k3 bration over a p 1
base, in the adiabatic limit. denote by n1, n2 the instanton numbers of the two e8 groups.
we have to choose the gauge bundle with n1 + n2 = 24. when we shrink some of the
instantons to zero size we do not get a new gauge symmetry in six dimensions. instead,
we get massless tensor multiplets and hypermultiplets in six dimensions [3, 4]. the six-

5

dimensional tensor multiplet contains a 2-form eld b which is self-dual db = db. in
the dual picture of m-theory compactied on s1/z2, this process is viewed as placing m5-
branes near one of the e8 walls. there are tensionless strings that arise from membranes
stretched between the m5-branes and the e8 wall and couple to b. when we reduce on
p 1 the tensor multiplets do not give rise to gauge elds but rather to matter multiplets.
this is due to the fact that there are no 1-forms  on p 1, which otherwise would enable
us to decompose db = f   and obtain the gauge eld strength f .

we can however obtain vectors elds in six dimensions and a large class of gauge
groups and matter content by shrinking e8 instantons at ade singularities [17]. for
instance, if we shrink k instantons at an1 singularity we get a gauge group qn1
i=2 su(i) 
su(n)k2n+1  qn1
j=2 su(j) with bi-fundamental matter. the six-dimensional gauge cou-
plings of these gauge groups is determined by vacuum expectation values (vevs) hi of
scalars in particular tensor multiplets [17]. these scalars in six dimensions have dimension
two and we can choose vevs hi  1/l2
h. upon reduction on p 1 we can identically repeat
the discussion in the previous section for the weakly coupled heterotic strings case. for
the horavawitten compactications an arbitrarily low scale can be obtained by taking
all or some of the ve dimensions transverse to the m5-brane large.

5 discussion

we have argued that the tree-level gauge and gravitational couplings dependence on the
string and compactication scales allow the latter to be arbitrarily low. in addition to the
necessity for building realistic models, many important questions related to the dynamics
of string theory remain to be addressed. for instance: how is supersymmetry broken?,
does this allow the size of the couplings to be small or the volumes large, as required for
lower values of the string scales? and how do loop corrections modify our analysis?

here we would like to briey comment on some issues of supersymmetry breaking. an
interesting possibility is to use the small instantons to break supersymmetry. for this
we choose a gauge bundle with (n1, n2) instanton number such that n1  n2 = 24 and
shrink the n2 anti-instantons. this conguration breaks suspersymmetry completely. on
the strongly coupled heterotic side, described by m-theory compactied on s1/z2, this
would correspond to placing n2 anti-m5-branes on one of the walls. supersymmetry is
then broken at the eleven-dimensional planck scale. this would need to be at tev if we
live on the anti-m5-branes, at intermediate energies if we live on the opposite wall, and
somewhere in between if we live on the same wall (gauge mediation). this is the heterotic

6

theory scenario corresponding to the proposal of [20] for type i vacua. obviously the issue
of stability has to be addressed in these models.

another possibility is to break supersymmetry spontaneously by wrapping the m5-
brane on the boundary wall around a non-supersymmetric cycle [21] (the use of ve-
branes in the bulk as hidden sector to break supersymmetry was suggested in [22]). this
is useful, for instance, in scenarios with a non-standard embedding [23] where the volume
on the hidden wall of the calabiyau space is large, making the gauge interaction on
the wall weaker than needed to induce non-perturbative eects that are able to break
supersymmetry at desired scales. also when small instantons are localized at dierent
points of k3, they may act as hidden sectors as in the f-theory scenario of [24]. the
observable and hidden sectors communicate through both gravity and the so(32) or
e8 e8 gauge symmetries. finally, for very low values of the string scale, one may replace
in all models discussed above the base p 1 of the calabiyau 3-fold by two circles with
boundary conditions that break all the supersymmetries.

to summarize, we considered generic features of the gauge theories arising from small
instantons and pointed out to some aspects that are of phenomenological relevance, such
as a possibility to lower the string scale, extremely weakly coupled gauge symmetries
that act as global non-abelian symmetries, and nally a possible role in the dynamics of
supersymmetry breaking. these, we believe, deserve further studies.
