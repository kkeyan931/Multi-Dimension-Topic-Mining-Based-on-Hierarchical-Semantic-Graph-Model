abstract

we derive a new form of loop equations for light-like wilson loops.
in bosonic theories those loop equations close only for straight light-
like wilson lines. in the case of n = 1 in ten dimensions they close
for any light-like wilson loop. upon dimensional reduction to n = 4
sym in four dimensions, these loops become exactly the chiral loops
which can be evaluated semiclassically, in the strong coupling limit,
by a minimal surface in anti de-sitter space. we show that the ads
calculation satises those loop equations. we also nd a new fermionic
loop equation derived from the gauge theory fermionic equation of
motion.

1 introduction

loop equations were proposed [1] in an attempt to understand the string
theory that governs connement in qcd. the loop equations are dynamical
equations for the wilson loop [2], which in the string picture is the bound-
ary of an open string. the equation is given by a second order dierential
operator which annihilates smooth loops, and gives a non-trivial result for
self-intersecting loops. they can be proven by a formal derivation, and there-
fore should be solved by any (regularized, but not renormalized) calculation
of the wilson loop. indeed, they are solved by perturbation theory [3] and
by lattice qcd. in the case of two dimensional pure gauge, which is soluble,
this solution also solves the loop equation[4].

an important feature of loop equations is that they are correct at all
values of the coupling constant. that is the basis for the hope of under-
standing connement through them. in particular, they constitute a test for
any proposed denition of the theory at strong coupling.

the famous maldacena conjecture [5, 6, 7]1 states that n = 4 supersym-
metric u(n) gauge theory in four dimensions is dual to type iib string theory
on a background geometry ads5  s5 (with certain 5-form ux). according
to the conjecture [9, 10] the expectation value of a wilson loop is given at
large n and strong coupling by a minimal surface calculation. this is exactly
such a non-perturbative denition of a gauge theory, and it is natural to ask
if this ansatz solves the loop equation.

this question was addressed recently [11], and the conclusion was that
to the extent that the equations could be checked they are solved by string
theory. the main diculty in applying the loop equations to the ads calcu-
lation was that the ads ansatz is simple only for a restricted family of loops.
if the loop is smooth its expectation value is given by a minimal surface only
if it satises a local bps condition that the coupling to the scalars is equal to
the coupling to the gauge elds. if one writes the wilson loop (in lorentzian
space) as

(1.1)

w =

n

trp exp(cid:18)ii (cid:16)a x + i yi(cid:17) ds(cid:19) ,

where a are the gauge elds and i the scalars, the condition is | x| = | y|.
the regular denition of the loop laplacian requires dierentiation in all

directions, and so breaks this constraint. therefore in that paper we had
to guess how to extend the ansatz also to loops which break the constraint
slightly. there is a bigger problem for loops with cusps or intersections, then
the constraint is broken by a large amount and therefore the loop equations
could not be checked.

in this paper we nd a new form for the loop equations which does not
require dierentiation away from the constraint. one dierentiates only in
eight independent bosonic and eight fermionic directions which commute
with the constraint. those equations also behave better under supersymme-
try, and in fact the loop laplacian is the anticommutator of two fermionic
operators. one of the fermionic operators generates another loop equation
derived from the gauginos equations of motion.

those equations can be derived also in non-supersymmetric gauge theo-
ries, but only for a very restricted family of loops. the wilson loop has to
be a straight light-like line.

in the next section we review the regular form of the loop equations (for

non-supersymmetric theories).

the derivation of the light-cone loop equations is presented in section 3.
the proofs of some of the equations presented in that section are given in
the appendix, because they are rather horrible.

we conclude with a discussion on how those loop equations can be ap-
plied to the wilson loops that are calculated by minimal surfaces in ads.
the equations are satised by smooth loops with no self intersections. they
cannot be checked when the loops have cusps or intersections, since those
loops cannot be calculated by a minimal surface when the constraint is sat-
ised. we also speculate about other applications for this formalism, and
present some suggestions for future work.

2 short review of loop equations

let us rst review the regular form of the loop equation in pure yang-mills,
as the new form will use many of the same techniques. for more complete
reviews see [12, 13].

2

the action of pure gauge theory in any number of dimensions is2

s = 

1
4g2

y m z dx trff ,

and the wilson loop is given by

w =

1
n

trp exp(cid:18)ii adx(cid:19) ,

where the integral is over a path parametrized by x.

the rst functional derivative of the loop is



x(s)

w = i x(s)f a

trp(cid:20)t a(s) exp(cid:18)ii adx(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

f is the eld strength and t a(s) is a generator of the gauge group inserted
at the point s along the loop.

the second derivative can insert another f into the loop, but also has

a contact term

2

x(s)x(s)

w =  x(s)f a

 x(s)f b

 trp(cid:20)t a(s)t b(s) exp(cid:18)ii adx(cid:19)(cid:21)
(s  s)trp(cid:20)t a(s) exp(cid:18)ii adx(cid:19)(cid:21) .

(2.4)

i x(s)df a

to write the loop equations we want to retain only the contact term. there-
fore we integrate s over an interval of vanishing width around s, picking out
only the delta function term. the loop laplacian is dened as

l = lim

0i dsz s+

s

ds

2

x(s)x(s)

.

(2.5)

from (2.4) we get

lhwi = ii ds x(cid:28)(df)a(s)

1
n

trp(cid:20)t a(s) exp(cid:18)ii adx(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:29).

(2.6)

2the complete action contains a gauge xing term and ghosts. those appear also in

the equations of motion, but can be dropped by a ward identity [3].

3

so we see that l inserts the variation of the action xdf into the loop.
this insertion into the loop would be zero if we use the classical equation of
motion, but quantum corrections produce contact terms. to see that, one
can write the equations of motion as the functional derivative of the action
s and use the schwinger-dyson equations, i.e. integration by parts in the
functional integral,

y mz dai ds
lhwi = g2
y m*i ds x(s)
= g2

eis

aa(x(s))



aa(x(s))

1
n

trp(cid:20)t a(s) exp(cid:18)ii adx(cid:19)(cid:21)+.

the functional derivative /a(x(s)) in this equation is formally evaluated
as

(2.7)

lhwi = i



n 2 i dsi ds (x(s)  x(s)) x(s) x(s)

(cid:28)trp(cid:20)t a(s)t a(s) exp(cid:18)ii adx(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:29).

we then use the relation between the generators of su(n),

t a
nmt a

kl = nkml 

nmkl

n

.

(2.8)

(2.9)

ignoring the 1/n term, the trace is broken into two. this gives the correlation
function of two loops. in the large n limit, the correlator factorizes and we
obtain,

lhwi = ii dsi ds (x(s)  x(s)) x(s) x(s)hwssihwssi.

(2.10)

here wss is a wilson-loop that start at s and goes to s and wss goes from s
to s. they are closed due to the delta function.

according to equation (2.10) lhwi should receive contributions from
self-intersections of the loop. every intersection point contributes a term
proportional to the dot product of the two tangent vectors. likewise, at a
cusp we expect to get a term proportional to the product of the right and left
tangent vectors. it seems like we should also count the trivial case of s = s,

4

when wss = 1 and wss = w . in most of the literature on the loop equation,
this trivial self-intersection is ignored. in any case, it can be taken care of by
multiplicative renormalization of the loop operator. for a supersymmetric
loop, there should be no renormalization and the leading contribution from
the trivial self-intersection cancels, because x2 = 0.

3 light-cone loop equations

after presenting the regular loop equations, we derive the light-cone loop
equations, utilizing constrained derivatives. first we derive them for bosonic
theories (where they usually dont give closed loop equations), and then for
the supersymmetric case. somewhat similar ideas were used in the context
of the type iib matrix model in [14, 15].

3.1 bosonic case

the bosonic light-cone loop equations can be derived in any dimension. but
since we will eventually turn to the n = 4 theory in four dimensions, we will
do it for the bosonic sector of that theory. for other cases there are changes
in numerical factors.

the theory has four gauge elds and six scalars. we work in ten dimen-
sional notations, where they are all denoted by a ( = 0 . . . 9). because
euclidean supersymmetry is a bit tricky, we work in lorentzian signature
(, +,   , +).
tion m2 = x x = 0. we use light-cone coordinates x = ( x0 + x1) /2 so

our goal is to write loop equations for loops satisfying the on-shell condi-

the constraint is 2 x x+ + xi xi = 0. a variation that preserves this constraint
will be of the form x x+ + x+ x + xi xi = 0. we take xi to be the
independent variations; then one can use reparametrization invariance to set
x to a constant and  x = 0. then solve

so

x+ = z s

(3.1)

(3.2)

5

the contribution from the second term in (3.1) is less singular, because of
the integral. since we are interested only in the most singular contact term
it can be ignored.

therefore we can dene a dierential operator that commutes with the

constraint

where the last term comes from the cross term, /xi acting on xi (with a

loop.

3 to reduce clutter, we drop the integration signs in this equation, but on the right
hand side we still mean that only the contact term is picked out and the expression is
integrated around the loop. the same will be done in many of the equations that follow,
where some obvious parts of the equations are omitted.

the last term is a total derivative, so for a closed (topologically trivial) loop
it integrates to zero.

for a straight line x = 0, so the second term is the same as the third and

is also a total derivative. ignoring the total derivatives we nd

(3.8)
this is the same as what the unconstrained loop laplacian gives. going
through the regular procedure (2.6)(2.10) we get

(3.9)

plus nonzero contributions at intersections.

the regular loop equations can be dened locally on the loop, not inte-
grated around it. the constrained loop equations work only when integrating
along the loop.

if the wilson loop is not a straight line, the constrained variation does

not give a closed loop equation. but the extra term i x x

in the supersymmetric case.

3.2 supersymmetric wilson loop
the n = 4 gauge theory in four dimensions has, in addition to the gauge
elds and scalars, also gauginos . the wilson loop could couple also to
them, or in other words, the bosonic loop we considered so far belongs to a
supermultiplet, whose other members have also fermionic parameters. still
working in ten dimensional notations, in the light-cone  breaks into 1 in
the 8s of so(8) and 2 in the 8c (1 = +2 = 0).

the light-cone. q1 (after rescaling) acts by

(3.10)

(3.11)

as was shown in [11], the loops satisfying the masslessness condition
x2 = 0 are locally bps, and depend on only eight fermionic parameters.
therefore, to write the supersymmetric wilson loop we introduce a fermion
a in the 8s. the supersymmetric wilson loop is

eq1 (and eq2) are other susy generators acting on x giving  by

(3.13)

there are a few justications for including the action of eq1. for one we were

unable to write loop equations without it. but also, regarding the wilson
loop as the rst quantized action for a w-boson of a broken su(n + 1) gauge

8

group, we should use the supersymmetry generators of that group, which
also act on the xs.

it is useful to write the supersymmetric loop as

to simplify the equations we used the anti-symmetric symbol [. . .] (normal-
ized by 1/6).

the action of eq1 gives

both couple to a. this modies the on-shell condition to 2 x x+ + xi xi +

this is the equation of motion for the supersymmetric gauge theory, which
allows us to complete the loop equations. by the usual manipulations this is
equal to

llc

[0]hwi = ii dsi ds x(s) x(s)4(x(s)  x(s))hw1ihw2i. (3.22)

when /a acts on the bosonic loop it brings down i x, but acting on the
supersymmetric loop (3.14) will bring down more terms of higher order in .
it is easy to see, though, that all those terms are zero when multiplied by x.
in the above we considered only the  = 0 part of the action of llc on
the loop. when  = 0 the on-shell constraint is x2 = 0, so the right hand
side vanishes for a smooth loop. but when  6= 0, as we mentioned before,

10

2  = 0, so we expect to get this extra
the constraint is modied to x x + i
term at higher orders in . indeed calculating the term linear in  one nds
many terms, most of them hopefully cancel, but some terms that remain are

we can use this to write a schwinger-dyson equation, or a fermionic loop

and the contribution from a smooth point is proportional to x x  i
which is indeed zero.
if the loop has cusps or intersections there will be
a contribution from all those points proportional to i/2 where  is a uv
cuto and a function of the angle between the two tangent vectors.

there might be other terms at higher orders in , but we should hope
they are also zero.
it would be nice to nd a manifestly supersymmetric
derivation of those equations, or another way to check them to all orders
in .

3.4 fermionic identities

we prove in the appendix that when acting on a loop q1 = q1 and q2 = q2 by
an explicit calculation for the rst few orders in . part of the calculation is
simply based on the construction of the loops in terms of q1, but at higher
orders in  the calculation becomes non-trivial involving fierz identities and
loop equations. one can also check the commutators of those operators, it
is easy to see that

{q1a, q1b} = i

where the last equality can be easily proven, and is related to reparametriza-
tion invariance. those commutators agree with those of the supercharges up
to a sign, as they should.

note that q1 is not the same as / (3.16), rather it has the opposite
sign on the second term. this is similar to n = 1 supersymmetry in four
dimensions where the susy generator is the same as the fermionic covariant
derivative up to such a sign ip.

12

since the action is invariant under supersymmetry, one might have hoped
to use the supersymmetry generators to write loop equations. but the su-
percharges cannot be expressed in terms of constrained variations, therefore
this is impossible. instead the constrained variations are

but since those are not symmetries of the action, they dont annihilate the
loop.

one can also dene

among themselves they commute to zero, but with q1 and q2

{q1a, q1b} = 2 xab,
{q1a, q4b} = {q2b, q3a} = xiiab,
2 x+ ab,
{q2 a, q4b} = 

and the right hand side is the light-cone decomposition of  x.

to see a dierent linear combination than x(df  1
got for the supersymmetrized loop laplacian. again if you continue to the
next step you nd that each term gives xii, and again at smooth points
they are canceled by the relative minus sign.

one might have actually expected two loop equations based on the fer-
mionic equation of motion, but we can get only one. since x2 = 0 the
factor x in (3.37) projects onto half the equations. we did get a dierent
fermionic loop equation in the piece linear in  in llc (3.23).

since q1 and q2 are symmetries of the loop, anticommuting them with
d should give an operator which annihilates the loop. the anticommutator
with q1 is trivial, but with q2 one gets (after some algebra) the light-cone
loop laplacian

nq2 a, dbo = i

4 conclusions

our main result is the operator llc dened in (3.17), which commutes with
2   = 0 and when acting on a wilson loop gives a
the constraint x x + i
closed loop equation. when the loop is smooth the equation reads

llchwi = i



3 i ds(cid:18) x x +

i
2

 (cid:19)hwi  0.

(4.1)

hwi  exp(cid:16)

 a(cid:17) ,

(4.2)

where  means that the most divergent pieces cancel. with cusps or inter-
sections there will be more divergent terms proportional to the product of
the two tangent vectors.

there is also a fermionic operator d, a dirac operator on loop space,
which also annihilates the loop. the operator llc is the anticommutator of
d with a supersymmetry generator.

the ads/cft correspondence tells us how to calculate some wilson
loops at strong t hooft coupling using minimal surfaces in ads. the ansatz
is

with a a legendre transform of the area of the minimal surface ending along
the loop at the boundary of ads.

for smooth loops this calculation, in terms of a minimal surface, is valid
only for loops satisfying the constraint x x = 0 (where x includes the
couplings to both scalars and gauge elds). therefore we can check if the
ansatz solves the light-cone loop equation.

the calculation is very simple. to leading order in  we get

llchwi  z ds   a

xi(s)!2

hwi.

(4.3)

it was argued [11] that, as long as the constraint is satised, the expectation
value of the loop is not divergent. since /xi commutes with the constraint,
it will give a nite result when acting on a. that means that there are no
divergent terms, as in (4.1).

this is not a very strong test of the conjecture, since those equations
are satised by any functional that assigns those loops a nite value. but it
does agree with the assertion that those loops are nite, and that the leading
behavior is proportional to .

it would be more interesting to check the equation for loops with cusps
and intersections, where the right hand side is not zero. unfortunately, those
loops can be evaluated by minimal surfaces only when x2 6= 0. so the new
loop equations are not valid. there were problems with using the other form
of the loop equations in this case too.

the calculation with the regular loop laplacian required extending the
ansatz (4.2) to loops that break the constraint. applying the light-cone loop
laplacian does not require this extension, and is therefore more reliable.

15

this argument applies to the ads calculation with both lorentzian and
euclidean signature. in the euclidean theory there are still light-like lines,
since the parameters that couple to the scalars are imaginary.

we derived the light-cone loop equations for bosonic theories, where they
close only for straight light-like lines. there might be applications of those
loop equations for qcd. for example, it might be possible to apply them to
wilson loops wrapping the compact light-like direction in dlcq of gauge
theories. for the n = 4 theory they close for any loop satisfying the con-
straint. we did not check if and when one can write such loop equations for
theories with n = 1 or n = 2 supersymmetry, which could be interesting.
when loop equations were rst constructed there was a hope to use them
to quantize the qcd string. this program was never completed, yet it is
tempting to think that if the regular loop equations are related to covariant
quantization of the qcd string, the light-cone equations are related to light-
cone quantization of the string. since light-cone quantization is easier in
some cases, it might enable progress in this direction. in the case of n = 4
sym, by the maldacena conjecture, the qcd string is just a fundamental
string in ads background.

it would be interesting to generalize to arbitrary loops. that would re-
quire an operator which commutes with a constraint like x2 = m2 and gives
a closed loop equation.

also, the equations were checked for the few lowest orders in the fermionic
it would be nice to nd a formulation that will prove the

parameter .
equations to all orders in .
