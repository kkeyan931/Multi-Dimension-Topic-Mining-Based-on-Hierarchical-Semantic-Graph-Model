(3) 4 ab = + 1 ab covariant dierential form respect spin connection ab, = 1 {a, b} = 2ab. two values possible two independent representations cliord algebra three spacetime dimension. naively one expects massless black hole corresponds ground state boundary cft, looks reasonable ads vacuum (m = 1/8g) disconnected black-hole spectrum (m 0), although ads vacuum lowest energy. however, choice ground state gives wrong answer bekenstein-hawking entropy, using ads vacuum instead gives correct answer. restrict spectrum solely black holes, corresponding cft seems restricted r- sector only. know well cannot modular invariant theory restricting r-sector only, contribution partition function r-sector transforms ns-sector modular transformations {$9309145$}. furthermore operator product expansion (ope) algebra superconformal theory   ,   ,   . (4) means cannot restrict cft r-sector only. moreover, identity come ope algebra eventually. examine carefully, note ads vacuum quite disjoint black hole spectrum, connected via singular point particle geometries (see preprint version, hep-th/9204099 ). becomes quite clear consider boundary geometries. actually one create massless black hole ads3 head-on collision two massless particles {$9309145$}. case mass gap, = 1/8g, ads3 spacetime massless black hole exactly matches energy two particles. spatial 5 geometry point particle conical singularity {$9309145$}. conical singularity serious problem. one resolve singularity replacing matter distribution small region point particle. fact, high energy scale, point particle structure resolved. important thing string cannot see orbifold xed point singular. look boundary conformal structure starting geometry. metric r = r0 surface geometry generated point particle source mass = 2/8g bulk 1 dt2 0 l2 + d2! , + 2, ds2 = r2 0 < 1, (5) note decit angle 2(1). redened (1+l2/r2 t. convenient work euclidean scheme. 0)1/2t ds2 e = r2 0(cid:16)d 2 + d2(cid:17) , (6) = it/l euclidean time. one focus r = r0 region rescaling 0 = 2 + d2. although boundary topology s1, angular geometry ds2 ds2/r2 decit angle. map cylindrical geometry decit angle conical one, i.e. boundary conformal cone, following exponential conformal mapping w = e +i( w = e i): ds2 cone = dwd w r22(dr2 + r2d2), (7) w holomorphic coordinate cone. introduced polar coordinates r = (e )1/ = / show conical structure, 0 r < w = z/ get , conformal plane: + 2. another conformal transformation w(z) = z/, ds2 cone = z1 z1dzdz.

(9) thus conformal weight primary cone related plane follows (with similar expressions l0): (lcone)0 = (lplane)0 + c 24 ( 1)( + 1). (10) note lcone interpolates lcylinder (for 0) lplane (for = 1). spinning particle case, follow similar step. case l0 l0 shifted dierently l0 l0 6= 0. another thing connects two limit. spectral ow two states corresponding boundary cft. however, realize spectral ow one actually needs extended supersymmetry. fact, one show black hole horizon, supersymmetry enhancement. see let us consider killing spinor equation massless black hole case. r l dt l 1 2 = + 2l rdt = 0 + l 01 d12!! 1 + rd2! ldr r solutions = 1; = 1; r 2l r 2l x! x! + + = r+ = 1 r = 1 r = r, 7 (11) (12) (13) x = t0/l + 2. due -dependent terms, two four killing spinors survive upon identication + 2. however near horizon -dependent terms drop relatively small compared 1/r terms, four solutions survive enhancing supersymmetry. enhancement surprising thing see similar cases discussed {$9309145$}. actually enhancement supersymmetry boundary cft consistent spacetime supersymmetry. horizon boundary cft (for microscopic degrees freedom btz black holes) located, solve entropy problem. (1,1)-type ads supergravity bulk gives rise (2,2) supersymmetric horizon cft. one ask, mass black hole zero, boundary cft makes sense, horizon point. problem btz black hole coordinate patch cannot cover whole region ads3. fact, r = 0 point null surfaces global coordinates ads3, deliminating poincare region {$9309145$}. black hole spectrum, say, ads3 spacetime conical geometries point particles, one take boundary point nite radius. boundary geometry looks regardless value radius have. isomorphism, maps r-sector ns-sector (2,2) supersymmetric cft spectral ow {$9309145$}. want show spectral ow fact symmetry transformation, i.e. superconformal transformation superspace. see write super stress-energy tensor superspace formalism follows: j (z, +, ) = j(z) + +g(z) + g+(z) + i+t (z). superconformal transformation stress energy tensor given j (z, +, ) (d+ +) j (z, +, ) + ik 4 s(z, z), (14) (15) = derivative . z = (z, +, ) complex n = 2 supercoordinate. z superderivatives s(z, z) n = 2 super-schwarzian general, + superconformal transformation super riemann surface given 8 z = f (z), + = ++(z)+ + +(z), = +(z)+ + (z), (16) following superconformal condition: ++ = qf ei, = qf ei, + = + = 0, (17) functions f (z) (z). conventional conformal transformation corresponds case = 0. prime denotes derivative respect z. components super stress-energy tensor transform k 2 j(z) f j(z) g+(z) (f ) (z) (f )2 (z) + 2f j(z) + 2 ei g+(z), 3 g(z) (f ) 3 2 ei g(z) k 4 2()2 + f f 3 2 f f !2 . (18) denoting right hand sides j(z), g (z) t(z) respectively, one simplify (z) = g 0 (z)ei(z), (19) whole expression j(z) = j0(z) t(z) = t0(z) + 2j0(z) k = c/3 used. note j0(z), g , g c 6 c 6 ()2, 0 (z) t0(z) nothing standard superconformal transformation. rephrasing j ij/2 ln z, led spectral ow map n = 2 superconformal symmetry. means spectral ow understood kind superconformal transformation. twist operator connects ns-vacuum r-vacuum tool set primary operators. (the interpretation expected spectral ow higher extended superconformal symmetry.) true vacuum turns ns-vacuum. makes ce = c, whatever theory horizon cft is. another advantage spectral ow understand black hole creation (r-state) particle (ns-state) collisions terms ope. particle collision would ope two ns-states, seems making r-state impossible. however spectral ow, actually make 9   + (20) + = 1 actually 1 = . cardys formula, counts physical degrees freedom, must invariant symmetry, thus spectral ow. rel- evance spectral ow black hole entropy discussed ref. , unitary representation n = 2 superconformal algebra {$9309145$} used. description spectral ow terms charged particles coupled chern-simons gauge theory discussed dierent setting {$9702088$}. calculate black hole entropy horizon cft, know central charge c conformal weight horizon state black hole. use results recently obtained carlip . c = 3r+ gt , = r+t 8g , (21) inverse hawking temperature arbitrary periodicity, aect result entropy. dierently asymptotic cft, central charge c depends inner outer horizon radius r, r+ black hole. dierent black hole gives dierent cft horizon. another remarkable thing horizon cft central charge c right moving mode vanishes case. features also found {$9812056$}. three dimension, one determine arbitrary periodicity follows. given black hole mass angular momentum j , conformal data xed (21). horizon state conformal weight (, ) contributes bulk mass angular momentum j. although energy horizon state needs equal bulk mass must proportional other; + = ml + , dimensionless constants adjust dierent scalings dierent base points energy respectively. one also nd relation angular momentum horizon state bulk angular momentum j = j. energy gap beween r-vacuum ns-vacuum horizon cft matches mass gap massless black hole ads vacuum. 10 c 24 = l 8g , (22) tells us c = 3l/g /t = l/r+. therefore ambiguity periodicity concerned dierent energy scalings horizon cft bulk ads geometry. carlips results known facts ads vacuum one determine completely, therefore x periodicity.

(23) central charge c together conformal weight ( , j) = results correct statistical entropy 2r+/4g. lastly, would like comment success string theory gives correct entropy, regardless delicate arguments give supergravity theory. successes specify microscopic structure works making use bps arguments. least weak coupling regime, point microscopic structure resides world volume d-branes. weak coupling region, meaningless say bulk geometry. d1-d5-kk case, eective world volume theory (4,4) supersymmetric sigma model symmetric product k3 . owing extended supersymmetry, cardys formula applied point ground state spectral ow long r-sector ns-sector fully included calculation. fortunately world volume theory, reason pick r sector ground state true ground state. several works seem produce correct central charge entropy using ads/cft correspondence, also without referring points resolved above. fact, one needs address question true ground state scheme also far microscopic structure specied. (even though microscopic 11 structure specied, one determine ground state using supersymmetry.) calculation two point function stress energy tensor, priori assumed ground state ns-sector since poincare coordinates (without identication) usually used. however, one neglect 3-sphere part ads3s3, supersymmetry asymptotic boundary n = 1 r sector ground state supersymmetry enhancement asymptotic boundary dierently horizon. therefore spectral ow expected asymptotic cft. one resort method say ns vacuum true vacuum asymptotic cft. acknowledgements would like thank j. de boer, a. giveon n. ohta discussions. work supported kosef (981-0201-002-2) korea research foundation (1998-015-d00073). 12
