on the flattening of negative curvature via t-duality with a

non-constant b-eld

abstract

in an earlier paper, alvarez, alvarez-gaume, barbon and lozano pointed out,
that the only way to atten negative curvature by means of a t-duality is by
introducing an appropriate, non-constant ns-ns 2-form b. in this paper, we are
investigating this further and ask, whether it is possible to t-dualize adsd space
to at space with some suitably chosen b. to answer this question, we derive the
relation between the original curvature tensor and the one of the t-dualized metric
involving the b-eld. it turns out that there is one component which is independent
of b. by inspection of this component we show that it is not possible to dualize
adsd to at space irrespective of the choice of b. finally, we examine the extension
of ads to an ads5 s5 geometry and propose a chain of s- and t-dualities together
with an sl(2, z) coordinate transformation, leading to a dual d9-brane geometry.

by now the ads-cft conjecture [1, 2, 3] has passed an enormous amount of tests (see
[4] for a review). most of them explored the large n duality between the boundary-cft
and the supergravity on ads5. the common radius of the s5 and the length-scale of the
ads5, r, is given by r4 = ()2, with  = g2
y m n representing the t hooft coupling. in
general supergravity as the low-energy limit of string-theory is trustworthy only at large
scales, i.e. small curvatures. thus tests of the duality probing the supergravity regime
explore the    parameter region. this predicts how the cft at large n behaves in
the extreme non-perturbative regime.
the interesting parameter regime, interpolating between the perturbative   0 and
the extreme non-perturbative    regime, demands that we keep  nite. since the
closed string coupling constant gs and the yang-mills coupling constant are related via
g2
y m = 4gs, the large n limit with  nite, requires gs  0. thus via the ads-cft
conjecture, we are able to extract the full quantum information about the cft in the large
n limit by calculating simply iib string tree-diagrams. unfortunately, this wonderful
perspective is obstructed by the fact, that iib string-theory in the rns-formulation on
an ads5  s5 background with n units of rr 5-form ux through the s5 is still obscure
(see [5] for an approach). on the other hand there are proposals for a gs-formulation [6]
which is non-linear and therefore its quantization and computation of string scattering
amplitudes seems to be dicult.

since string-theory on an ads5  s5 background is not readily available, one may
seek resort to a dual description of iib string-theory on a, hopefully, easier background.
as a rst step into this direction, we want to analyze in this paper, whether pure adsd
space can be dualized to at minkowski space. this would have important consequences
for the cosmological constant in string-theory brane-worlds based on a bulk adsd space
[7]. the concrete motivation for this problem stems from the observation, made in [8],
that the only way to atten negative curvature under t-duality is by introducing an
appropriate torsion, generated by b, in the initial space-time. this can be seen from
the following formula2, relating the dual curvature scalar r to the initial curvature scalar
[8]

r = r + 4  ln k +

here a = k/k2, k = g with the associated eld-strength f = a  a.
furthermore,  ln k = 1g (cid:0)gg ln k(cid:1) denotes the dalembertian with respect to
the initial metric. as usual, the torsion 3-form is the eld strength3 h = db of the ns-
ns 2-form b. the killing vector, corresponding to the assumed translational isometry
exhibited by the initial space-time, is given by k and its norm dened by k = pgkk.
one could now try to solve (1) for r =  and r = 0, with  a positive constant. but

this would include any solution of the vacuum einstein equations. to decide whether we
arrive at at space after t-dualization, we have to regard the riemann curvature tensor.
let us start quite generally by assuming some coordinate representation of a d-
dimensional manifold, given by4 x = (x0, x1, . . . , xd2, xd1) = (x, x) ;  = 0, . . . , d 2.
furthermore, the initial metric is supposed to be of the form

ds2 = gdxdx + gdxdx .

we observe, that our choice of g = 0 cannot be compensated by an appropriate choice of
some real-valued b (only an imaginary would suce). the reason why we set neverthe-
less g = 0, from the outset, is the following. according to (1), a non-vanishing g = k
tends to make the curvature scalar of the dual metric more negative. since we start with
a negatively curved adsd and aim to bring it to at space, a k 6= 0 would obstruct our
intention.
we assume that the metric g(x) and the ns-ns 2-form b(x) do not depend on
x. these conditions are exactly those, which are required in order to leave the -model
action

s =

2 z d2z (g + b) x  x 

invariant under innitesimal shifts x  x + k. the killing vector associated with the
resulting abelian translational isometry, is k = /x, with k = (k, k) = (0, . . . , 1).
with the resulting norm k = g of the killing vector, a more convenient expression
for the metric (2) in view of our later application, is given in terms of an anholonomic
vielbein co-base by

where the chosen anholonomic vielbein el = (ea, ei) reads

ds2 = abeaeb + eiei = mnemen ,

ea = ea

later, we will also need the inverted vielbein of the isometry direction e

the above mentioned -model action is invariant [9] to rst order in  under the
translational isometry x = k, if k satises the killing equation (lkg) = kg, +

for some 1-form w. here lk and d denote the space-time lie- and exterior derivative.
locally, this is solved by w = ikb  v with dv = ikh for some 1-form v. under ik we
understand the interior product. from now on, we will choose the gauge w = 0, which
leads us, together with the identity (ikb) = kb = b, to

the t-dual metric g reduces in the case of k = 0 to

g = gvv + k2 .

the strategy of the calculation of the dual riemann-tensor will now be as follows.
with the aid of cartans structure equations, we determine the curvature tensor and its
t-dual in the el = {ea, ei}, resp. t-dual el = {ea, ei} co-base. in order to compare both
of them, it is further necessary to switch to the equivalent expressions in the common
holonomic co-base dx = (dx, dx) with the help of the aforementioned vielbeins.

therefore, let us begin with (3) and avail ourselves of cartans rst structure equation

as an application of these formulae, we now want to examine, whether d-dimensional
adsd space allows a t-dualization to at space under the inclusion of some suitably
chosen b. because both spaces, regarded as string backgrounds, leave all supersym-
metries intact this is a reasonable question to ask. we choose the following coordinate
representation for adsd

ds2 =

with l being the ads-radius.
it exhibits a negative, constant curvature scalar r =
d(d  1)/l2. let us rst choose for the isometry direction one of the yj coordinates,
e.g. yd2. we will see below how the results for this case extrapolate to the case of
a dierent isometry direction.
in our above convention, the adapted coordinates are
x0 = t, x1 = y1, . . . , xd3 = yd3, xd2 = r, xd1  x = yd2. the curvature tensor of the
negatively curved, maximally symmetric adsd is given by r =  1
l2 (gg  gg),
which reduces in our parameterization to6

and all other components vanishing. in particular, this gives r =  r4
l6 
l2(cid:1)r
r
. now, we had found one component, (13), of the dual curvature-tensor, which
was independent of v, resp. b and hence allows answering the above posed question.
plugging in the actual norm of the killing vector k = r/l for the above adsd metric, we
obtain for the right-hand side of (13) the expression 1
. obviously, this
does not fulll the requirement r = 0 for at space and is not even asymptotically at.

this can be extrapolated to any other isometry direction of adsd by noting that another
isometry direction dierent from the above choice of yd2 can be related to this one by a
general coordiante transformation x  x. however, the tensor transformation property
r (x) = (a
 = x/x, then guarantees that this term
is still non-vanishing in contrast to what one would need for a dual at spacetime. thus,
we can conclude that at space cannot be reached from pure adsd via t-duality under
the inclusion of some appropriately chosen b.

eventually, we turn briey to the important ads5  s5 extension of ads. here it
seems possible to relate the iib d9-brane geometry, which describes d=10 space itself,
to the ads5  s5 geometry. in order to do so, one has to start with a six-fold t-duality,
transforming the d9-brane to the d3-brane. then, dualizing a iib d3-brane to its own
near-horizon geometry, one reaches ads5  s5. this can be done following the work of
[10]. having t-dualized the d9-brane, the d3-brane geometry in string-frame reads

performing a further t-duality over x3, x2 brings us to the iib d1-brane. an s-duality
transformation then yields the fundamental iib string solution

the crucial step to get rid of the constant in the harmonic h8 function, consists of perform-
ing rst an sl(2, r) coordinate transformation on the coordinates t, x1 and subsequently
a t-duality transformation in the new x1 direction. provided that we choose the special
sl(2, r) coordinate transformation

t =

x1 = 2x1 ,

(20)

we are guaranteed that the transformation is globally well-dened on (t, x1) space, which
has the topology of a cylinder due to the compactication of x1. after t-duality in
x1 direction the result is a modied fundamental string without constant part in the
harmonic function

it is important to note that the last t-duality has again been along a space-like direc-
tion. therefore we are secured to stay in the type ii string-theory framework instead of
changing to type ii* [11].

now, proceeding in the inverse manner, a second s-duality promotes us to a modied
d1-brane. ultimately, with two t-dualities in the x2, x3 directions we end up with a modi-
ed d3-brane solution without a constant part in its harmonic function. as is well-known,
this gives the ads5  s5 geometry. notice, however, that the d3-brane solution is only
locally dual to the ads5  s5 solution. in order to perform the various t-dualities, the
brane has to be wrapped on a torus with all worldvolume coordinates taken to be periodic.
therefore the coordinates of the nal ads5  s5 geometry in addition have to be identi-
ed globally. as mentioned in [10] this has the eect that only half the killing spinors of
ads5 remain. thus, only locally we have a maximally supersymmetric ads5s5 solution.
globally, the d3-brane as well as the dual solution break half the supersymmetry.
a word of caution is in order. the spacetime-lling d9-brane is supposed to describe
at ten-dimensional minkowski spacetime [12]. however, the d9-brane breaks half the
supersymmetry, whereas at space does not. the resolution to this puzzle comes from the
well-known fact, that the open-string sector of n d9-branes is only consistent, if we have
n = 32 of them and perform an orientifolding by the world-sheet parity  :     .
this breaks half the supersymmetry and the resulting type i so(32) theory gives us in
addition to the at ten-dimensional minkowski solution a spacetime-lling o9 orientifold
xed plane. it would be interesting to study the inuence of dualities on the cosmologi-
cal constant in string-theory more generally. in particular the strongly coupled heterotic
string [13] whose non-perturbative open membrane boundary-boundary interactions lead
to a non-vanishing positive vacuum energy [14] (see also [15]) would be an interesting
candidate to study.
