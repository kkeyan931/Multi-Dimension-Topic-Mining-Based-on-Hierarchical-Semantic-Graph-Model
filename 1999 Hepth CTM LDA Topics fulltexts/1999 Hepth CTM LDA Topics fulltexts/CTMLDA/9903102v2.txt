1 introduction

the quantum zitterbewegung plays important but hidden role in physics of spin particles.
it reveals itself nontrivially, e.g., under description of interaction of dirac particle with
electromagnetic eld at the relativistic quantum mechanical level. with minimal coupling
prescription, the electromagnetic eld interacts locally with the point charge whose coordi-
nates exhibit the zitterbewegung [1], whereas the attempt of reformulating the interaction
in terms of pryce-newton-wigner coordinates [2] having no trembling component in their
evolution makes the theory to be nonlocal [3].

the superposition of rectilinear and trembling motions may result in helical trajectory
it is this picture of motion that is a characteristic
for the quantum dirac particle [4].
feature of various classical models of 4d spinning particles [5][10] and 3d anyons [11][15].
however, these models with the underlying zitterbewegung suer from the same problem
which emerges for the pseudoclassical models of 4d higher spin particles [16]. they, unlike
the simplest pseudoclassical model for dirac particle [17], fail to be consistent under attempt
to switch on interaction with an arbitrary gauge or gravitational eld.

the success of spin-1/2 pseudoclassical model [17] indicates that more detailed analysis
of the hidden role of the zitterbewegung in the theory of spinning particles may be useful.
in model [17], the velocity of the particle contains a term being a classical analog of the
quantum zitterbewegung. such term has a pure nilpotent nature (see the next section) and,
as a consequence, generally the motion of the particle in model [17] cannot be visualized.
besides, the direct classical analog of the dirac hamiltonian h =  0(pii +m) generating the
zitterbewegung is given there by a pure nilpotent quantity. the diculties with nilpotency
are absent in the models with even spin variables. it was observed [7] that classically the
velocity of the massive spinning particle in such models may take any value up to the velocity
of light. with superluminal velocities for the massive particle, unlike the massless case [6],
one looses the time interpretation for x0 component of the vector x [7]. it was also shown
[7, 6] that the classical zitterbewegung is not gauge-invariant and the modied coordinates
of the particle revealing no trembling motion in their evolution are the classical analogs of
the non-covariant newton-wigner coordinates. but in dirac theory the usual (covariant)
coordinates revealing the zitterbewegung play more fundamental role from the viewpoint of
interactions. therefore, the classical models for spinning particles which would reproduce
exactly the peculiar nature of the quantum zitterbewegung  the instant velocity of the
massive particle equal to the velocity of light  could play a special role in the theory.

recently, the geometrical model with higher derivatives has been constructed in ref.
[18]. unlike the known geometrical models of 4d spinning particles and 3d anyons, it
is formulated from the very beginning on the light-like curves. like the known models
with higher derivatives [12], the model [18] has a spectrum similar to that of the majorana
equation, which possesses the massive, massless and tachyonic solutions. after reduction by
extra constraint singling out a massive state, one can arrive nally at the model of massive
spinning particle with light-like world trajectories.

in this letter we shall show that the model for massive 4d spinning particles and 3d
anyons with light-like world-lines may be constructed in another way: by reducing the model
of spinning particles of a xed mass to the light-like curves. the model obtained in this way
does not contain higher derivatives and has no hidden tachyonic states which could reveal

2

themselves after switching on interaction. it has a property of universality which manifests
itself in the same form for the lagrangian in 4 and 3 dimensions. finally, it allows us to
explain the peculiarity of the light-like trajectories produced due to the zitterbewegung from
the viewpoint of reduction and reparametrization invariance.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we shortly discuss the zitterbewegung in
pseudoclassical model [17] and show how the model of spinning particle [7] can be obtained
via the formal bosonization of the former model. in section 3 we obtain the massive model
of spinning particle with light-like world trajectories by the reduction to the light-like curves.
we discuss dierent reduction procedures giving rise to the same nal lagrangian of a simple
form which explicitly guarantees the velocity of light for the particle. section 4 concerns the
quantum theory of the model in 4 and 3 dimensions. section 5 is devoted to discussion and
concluding remarks.

2 bosonization and zitterbewegung

the pseudoclassical model for the massive dirac particle in 4 dimensions is given by the
lagrangian [17]

l =

1
2e

( x  i)2 

e

m2  im5 

i

i
2

5 5,

(2.1)

where  and 5 are grassmann (odd) variables, which are transformed after quantization
(up to the numerical factors) into 5 and 5 matrices. variables e and  are even and odd
lagrange multipliers associated with reparametrization symmetry and local supersymmetry
of the system generated by the rst-class constraints

p2 + m2  0,

p + m5  0

(2.2)

by means of the poisson-dirac brackets {x, p} = , {, } = i , {5, 5} = i.
corresponding hamiltonian equations of motion for the space-time coordinates of the particle
have the form

x = ep + i,

(2.3)

i.e. in addition to the translational part along the energy-momentum vector p, the velocity
has additional term being classical analog of the quantum zitterbewegung. however, in
contrast with the quantum case, this additional term has a nilpotent nature due to which
the classical zitterbewegung cannot be characterized numerically and in general the motion
of the particle cannot be visualized.

to visualize the classical zitterbewegung, let us realize the formal bosonization of the
pseudoclassical model by substituting the odd grassmann (classical fermionic) variables ,
5 and  for the even (classical bosonic) variables q, q5 and v. with such substitution the
kinetic term for spin variables q and q5 will be a total derivative. to nd the appropriate
kinetic term, it is necessary to note that for the grassmann variables there is no usual concept
of the length. the bosonized elongated velocity x = x  vq does not feel the length of
the vector q either since the local change, q  q,  = ( ) 6= 0, can be compensated
by the transformation v  1v leaving x to be invariant. the term mvq5 is invariant

3

under rescaling of q5 in the same way. therefore, one can construct the kinetic term which
would be invariant under local rescaling qm   qm , where we have introduced the notation
qm = (q, q5). taking also into account that kinetic term for spin variables in (2.1) is of
the rst order in parameter evolution derivative (and, as a consequence, the corresponding
term of the action is reparametrization invariant), we take  n2 as a kinetic term for
the bosonic spin variables, where  is a nonzero parameter, nm = qm /q2 and we suppose
that q2 = qm qn m n > 0, n2  0, m n = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1). finally, we arrive at the following
lagrangian for 4d spinning particle [7]:

l =

1
2e

( x  vq)2 

e
2

m2  mvq5  q n2.

(2.4)

at the hamiltonian level the system (2.4) is described by the set of rst class constraints

1 =  q  0, 2 = 2 q2  2  0, 3 = pe  0, 4 = pv  0,

5 = p2 + m2  0, 6 = pq + mq5, 7 = p + m5  0,

(2.5)
(2.6)

among which constraints (2.5) are primary and (2.6) are secondary constraints, and the
quantity

h =

e
2

5 + v6 +

4

x

a=1

waa

(2.7)

plays the role of the total hamiltonian with wa = wa( ), a = 1, . . . , 4, being arbitrary
functions. here m are the momenta canonically conjugate to qm , {qm , n} = m n . what
is the physical sense of the nontrivial constraints 1, 2, 6 and 7? the last two constraints
play the same role as the odd constraint from (2.2): eectively they are the square root
constraints from the mass shell constraint 5, {6, 7} = 5, and kill the nonphysical degrees
of freedom associated with the time components q0 and 0 whose quantum analogs could
produce negative norm states. constraint 1 generates the above mentioned local rescaling
transformations and guarantees that there are no oscillation radial-like degrees of freedom
which could be associated with the change of the scale of internal variables. therefore, the
system can have only the internal rotational degrees of freedom. on the surface of other
constraints, the constraint 2 can be written in the equivalent form

s 2  2  0,

(2.8)

where

s =

1

2p2 pm 

is the spin vector and m  is the conserved angular momentum of the particle. so, like the
initial model (2.1), the bosonized model (2.4) also describes the particle with xed mass and
spin. one notes that the constraint analogous to (2.8) appears in the form of spirality-xing
condition in the twistor theory of massless spin particles [19]-[23].

hamiltonian (2.7) generates the equations of motion

x = ep + vq

(2.9)

4

being the bosonized version of eq.
(2.3), i.e. now the classical analog of the quantum
zitterbewegung can be visualized though it is not gauge-invariant [7]. taking into account
constraints 5 and 6, eq. (2.9) gives x2 = e2m2 + 2emvq5  q2v2. as we have mentioned,
the analysis shows that the velocity of the particle may take any value up to the velocity of
light ( x2  0), but cannot be superluminal ( x2 > 0) [7].
in conclusion of this section let us note that the obtained model can be transferred to
the 3-dimensional space-time. classically, the only dierence of the 3d case from the 4d
case consists in the spin nature. in 3d spin has a nature of a pseudoscalar [15],

s =

1

2p2 pm .

(2.10)

here the constraint 2 is, again, reduced to the condition of the form (2.8) but with s being
pseudoscalar (2.10). thus, all the results of the next section on the reduction of the model
to the light-like curves will be valid for both cases of 4 and 3 dimensions with the described
dierence which has to be implied. essential distinction between the two cases will happen
at the quantum level and this will be discussed in what follows.

3 reduction to the light-like world trajectories

let us require that the velocity of the spinning particle like the instant velocity of the
quantum dirac particle would be equal to the velocity of light. this can be achieved at the
lagrangian and hamiltonian levels with exactly the same nal result. first, let us impose
the condition

providing x2 = 0 as a gauge condition. it can be represented equivalently as

 = e2m2 + 2emvq5  q2v2  0

q5 

1
2

(q2ve1m1  emv1)  0.

(3.1)

(3.2)

we can treat this condition as a gauge for the constraint 1 and exclude the variables
q5 and 5 from the system with the help of the set of second class constraints 1 and
(3.2) by means of the dirac brackets or by reducing symplectic two-form of the system,
 = dp  dx + d  dq + d5  dq5, to the surface of these second-class constraints. then,
performing the inverse legendre transformation for the reduced hamiltonian, we arrive at
the lagrangian

l =

1
2e

x2  xqv 

2m

q2v 2 + m2q q2v 2 + 2 qq v v + q2 v 2,

(3.3)

where v = v/e. this lagrangian can also be derived by the direct substitution of (3.2) into
eq. (2.4). obviously, lagrangian (3.3) describes light-like motion of the particle since the
equation of motion for e gives directly the necessary relation x2 = 0. at the hamiltonian
level the reduced system (3.3) is described by the set of rst class constraints

1 = q  pv v  0, 2 = 2(q2v 2 + m2)2  4m22v 2  0, 3 = pe  0,
4 = 2pqv + q2v 2 + p2  0, 5 = p + pv v 2  0, 6 = p2 + m2  0,

(3.4)
(3.5)

5

where constraints (3.4) are primary and eq. (3.5) gives the set of secondary constraints. from
the explicit form of the constraints it is clear that the canonical pair v and pv eectively
plays the role of the removed scalar variables q5 and 5. in particular, the constraint 2
playing the role of spin-xing condition may be represented in the form (2.8) if to take into
account other constraints.

one can simplify lagrangian (3.3) if to note that it depends on q and v only via
introducing the dimensionless vector q = v q/m, we represent

the combination v q.
lagrangian (3.3) in the equivalent form

l =

x2
2e  m xq 

2

1 + q2q q2.

(3.6)

at the hamiltonian level the physical equivalence of the reduced system (3.6) to the initial
system (2.4) may be established in the following way. in this case the complete set of primary
and secondary hamiltonian constraints is the set of 4 rst class constraints:

1 = p2 + m2  0, 2 = 2(q2 + 1)2  42  0,
3 = pq + 1
2m(q2  1)  0, 4 = p + q  0,

(3.7)
(3.8)

where  are the momenta canonically conjugate to q. on the surface of other constraints,
the constraint 2 is reduced to the spin-xing condition (2.8). one can introduce the con-
ditions 1 = q  0 and 2 = q2  1  0 as the gauges for the constraints 3 and 4.
this set of 4 second class constraints is equivalent to the set of constraints pq  0, p  0,
q  0 and q2  1  0. one can arrive at the same set of second class constraints and rst
class constraints 1 and 2  2  0 if to introduce at the hamiltonian level into the model
(2.4) the gauges q5  0 and 5  0. indeed, these two gauges form themselves the set of
second class constraints. reducing the system to the surface dened by them we shall get
the mixed set of rst and second class constraints specied above with substitution of q
and  for q and .

one can also arrive at the lagrangian (3.6) if to treat relation (3.1) as a constraint on
v. then, reducing the system to the surface of constraints (3.1) and pv  0, and performing
the inverse legendre transformation, we arrive at the lagrangian of the form (2.4) but with
v = v e, where v = v (q2, q5) is dened by the equation v 2q2 + 2mv q5  m2 = 0. finally,
realizing the substitution q = v q/m, we get the lagrangian (3.6).
due to the invariance of the terms vq, vq5 and  n2 in (2.4) under the local transforma-
tions qm   qm , v  1v, one can remove the lagrange multiplier v by introducing new
variables qm = m1ve1 qm before the reduction procedure. then the lagrangian (2.4) can
be represented in the physically equivalent form

l =

x2
2e  m xq 

e
2

m2(1 + 2q5  q2)  q n 2,

(3.9)

where nm = qm /q q2. now, the reduction to the light-like curves may be realized by
the substitution q5 = 1
2(q2  1) into lagrangian (3.9). the result is given by the same
lagrangian (3.6).

6

we have reduced the model of spinning particle to the light-like curves dened by the
relation x2 = 0. is it possible to use for reduction the relativistic-invariant condition of more
general form

x2 =  2

(3.10)

with  being a constant? the answer is no and the special role of the light-like case
( = 0) may be understood as follows. if  6= 0, then by changing the scale of the parameter
evolution,   ||1 , we change condition (3.10) for the relation x2 = 1. the latter
relation is nothing else as the proper time gauge condition, i.e. for  6= 0 eq. (3.10) destroys
the reparametrization invariance and xes the parameter evolution. the special role of
 = 0 case in eq. (3.10) can also be understood from the observation that if we change
x2 in lagrangian (3.6) for x2   2,  6= 0, the equation of motion for e will be eq. (3.10),
but the term  2/2e in the lagrangian will destroy the reparametrization invariance of the
action. therefore, we conclude that introducing relativistic-invariant condition (3.10) into
the theory for  6= 0 is the parametrization-xing procedure, whereas reduction with  = 0
is the only possible case to be consistent with the reparametrization invariance of the theory
for the massive spinning particle. this observation gives an explanation for the paradox of
the special role played by the light-like world-lines in the theory of massive spinning particles
and sheds some light on the nature of the zitterbewegung.

4 on quantum theory of the model

we have demonstrated that the realized reduction procedure giving rise to the model of
massive spinning particle in 4 and 3 dimensions does not change the physical content of the
initial system. therefore, the results on the quantum theory of the model (2.4) in 4 and 3
dimensions can be used. the interested reader may found the details on the covariant and
reduced phase space quantization of the system (2.4) for these two cases in refs.
[7] and
[11], but here we restrict ourselves only by a short comment on the results stressing their
topological aspects.

in the case of 4 dimensions before taking into account the spin-xing condition (2.8), the
internal conguration space of the system can be described eectively by one 3-dimensional
unit vector, i.e. it is a sphere s 2, whereas the internal phase space is the cotangent bundle
t s 2. as a consequence, the spin operator has a nature of orbital angular momentum
[24]. then taking into account spin-xing condition (2.8) leads to the quantization of the
parameter :  = n(n + 1), n = 1, 2, . . .. as a result, spin of the particle takes the
corresponding integer value s = n.

in the case of 3 dimensions, the internal conguration space of the system is described
eectively by a 2-dimensional unit vector, i.e. it is a sphere s 1 (circle). the internal phase
space (before reduction to the spin-xing surface (2.8)) is the cotangent bundle t s 1, and
the eigenvalues of the quantum spin operator can take arbitrary values on the real line [24].
no quantization condition appears for the parameter here. due to the quantum analog of
the spin-xing condition (2.8), spin of the particle takes two values s = j in the case when
|| = j and j > 0 is integer or half-integer number. for   r, || 6= j, the violation of the
classical p -invariance happens at the quantum level and spin takes either the value s = +
or s = .

7

to describe in 4d half-integer spins, the system has to be modied by using two sets of
spin variables [8], qi
m , i = 1, 2, instead of one set used here. in this way the internal cong-
uration space of the system may be described eectively by the pair of mutually orthogonal
unit vectors, i.e.
topologically it will be equivalent to the manifold of doubly-connected
so(3) group. such a dierence is sucient to describe integer and half-integer spin states
at the quantum level [24]. for the appropriately modied model [8] the reduction to the
light-like curves may be realized in the way similar to the described here.

it is worth to note that at the quantum level the quantization of the pseudoclassical
model (2.1) in 4d and 3d does not reveal so essential dierence as for the obtained bosonic
model. for the system (2.1), the only dierence is that in 3d the model gives rise to the
pair of dirac equations corresponding to spin s = +1/2 and s = 1/2 instead of one dirac
equation in 4d [25].

5 discussion and outlook

in the analysis of the classical analog of the quantum zitterbewegung we started from the
(locally) supersymmetric pseudoclassical lagrangian (2.1) describing spin-1/2 dirac particle.
as a nal result, we arrived at the bosonic lagrangian (3.6), which universally describes 4d
spinning particles and 3d anyons on the light-like curves. in both cases spin is dened by
the parameter  which, due to the topological reasons, is quantized in 4d but can take
arbitrary real values in 3d.

constructing the intermediate bosonic lagrangian (2.4), we essentially exploited the
properties of (locally) supersymmetric spin-1/2 particle action. in other words, our derivation
was based on (2.1) not only as on a starting point, but the applied bosonization procedure
itself was governed by the nature of the initial spin-1/2 particle supersymmetric action. with
the help of the nal form of the lagrangian (3.6), obtained via reduction of (2.4), we observed
that the peculiarity of the light-like trajectories produced due to the zitterbewegung can be
explained from the viewpoint of interplay of reparametrization invariance and reduction.

in our constructions we did not insist on attaching physical meaning to the grassmann
variables since one is only supposed to compute physical quantities after quantization. the
impossibility to describe the zitterbewegung in pseudo-classical approach was used here as
one of the motivations for its analysis with which we found that the special role of the
light-like trajectories for the massive spinning particles can be understood at the classical
level.

to conclude, let us indicate some problems that deserve further attention.
first, we note that a priori there is no obstruction for applying the ideas of the formal
bosonization constructions to the case of locally supersymmetric string. what will be the
physical content of the bosonic string constructed in such a way?

the spin-xing constraint (2.8) is reminiscent of the spirality-xing condition in twistor
formulation of the massless spin particles [19]-[23].
it would be interesting to investigate
the zitterbewegung aspect for the massive spinning particles using the twistor approach.
however, it is clear that the 4d-3d universality of our model (3.6) would be not so explicit
in the twistor theory, in which two types of spinors have to be distinguished in 4d, whereas
the 3d case is characterized by the presence of only one type of spinors.

8

the reduction procedure used for the system (2.4) cannot be applied directly for the
p -noninvariant models of 3d anyons [13, 15]. the reason is that their corresponding la-
grangians do not contain the analog of scalar variable q5. probably, to reduce those models
to the light-like curves, they rst should be modied appropriately by introducing some
auxiliary scalar variable. by the same reason it is not clear either how the corresponding
reduction procedure could be realized within the framework of the twistor approach applied
for describing massive spin particles.

finally, it seems to be interesting to continue the investigation of the model given by the

lagrangian with light-like world-lines (3.6) in the context of switching on interactions.
