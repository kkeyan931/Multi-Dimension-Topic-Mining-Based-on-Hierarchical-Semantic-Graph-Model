abstract

we consider a two-point spatial lattice approximation to an open
string moving in a at background with b eld. it gives a constrained
dipole system under the inuence of a vector potential. solving and
quantizing this system recover all the essential features of a noncom-
mutative space. in particular, open string interactions induce a canon-
ical product structure on the hilbert space of the dipole system. it
coincides with the usual star product, even though the position opera-
tors can be thought of as mutually commuting. modication of gauge
transformations in this noncommutative space also naturally emerges.

1 introduction and ideology

in the passage from classical to quantum mechanics, physical observables
of a system, which are functions on its phase space, become operators on
the hilbert space of physical states. the canonical commutation relations of
heisenberg

[x , p] = h


(1.1)

require as well as epitomize this fundamental change. thus in the quantum
world the phase space ceases to be a normal space, and the notion of it as
being made up of well dened points becomes invalid (the uncertainty prin-
ciple). rather than a function that evaluates at each point of phase space,
physical observables w (x, p ) must be understood as a whole operator. this
is how algebraic operations on them are performed. in particular, multiplica-
tions among operators are associative but generically noncommutative. this
is an instance of noncommutative geometry.

by contrast, other parts of the canonical commutation relations

[x , x ] = 0

(1.2)

indicate that the coordinates on the conguration space form a set of com-
muting observable and are simultaneously measurable. the usual point-
based geometry of the conguration space therefore survives. wavefunctions,
or more generally elds on it, obtain values at each point and algebraic op-
erations are performed pointwise.

it is perhaps only natural to go one step further and pass onto some non-
commutative geometry for the conguration space as well. for curiositys
sake it intrigues to see what transpires when wavefunctions and elds become
noncommutative objects, but from what sort of physical system would such
circumstances arise in the rst place? one class of such scenarios has recently
been uncovered: the matrix theory [1] naturally accommodates noncommu-
tative tori [2]. subsequently it is shown how heisenberg-like commutation
relations such as

[x , x ] = 

(1.3)

apply to the coordinate elds on the ends of an open string. in particular, 
is nonvanishing if so is the background for the anti-symmetric rank two tensor
b [3]. a noncommutative product of functions of the xs also appear in
the operator product expansion on the open string boundary [4].

1

this is of course not the rst time noncommutative geometry has been
advocated to play a role in (open) string theory. in [5], a noncommutative
but associative algebra quite naturally emerged from type i string theory and
was essential in formulating a string eld theory. however, this underlying
space of that algebra is very large and complicated even in its classical and
commutative form. it is the space of open paths in space-time. using the
terminology for open string quantization, it includes not only the wavefunc-
tion of the center of mass coordinates, but also those of the innite tower
of oscillators. somewhere among them one should be able to discern the
noncommutative geometry of just the space-time. the aim of this brief note
is precisely to extract this piece of information. in section two we truncate
the theory of an open string ending on a d-brane to a constrained quan-
tum mechanical model for its two end points. this dipole system inherits a
noncommutative product structure on its hilbert space from the open string
interaction. we show that it coincides the with star product in deformation
quantization in section three. this model allows us also to study also how
the usual gauge transformations are deformed in noncommutative geometry.
finally, we give some remarks.

2 the constrained dipole model

in conformal gauge, the free action for an open string starting and ending on
the same (single) d-brane is

s =

4 z
+z2

d2hg(cid:16) y  y   y y (cid:17) + b(cid:16) y y   y  y (cid:17)i
d a(y ) y  z2

d a(y ) y .

(2.1)

here 2 and 1 label the two boundaries of the open string worldsheet . g
and b are constant backgrounds for the metric and rank two anti-symmetric
tensor elds respectively. a is the background gauge potential for a constant
u(1) eld strength on the d-brane. the term involving b is a locally exact,
can be replaced by an integral on the boundaries, and absorbed by a 

 see also [6].

a + bx . we will do so in the rest of the paper and henceforth drop any
explicit reference to b, writing the action more succinctly as

s =

1

4 z
+z2

d2(cid:16) y 2  y 2(cid:17)
d a(y ) y  z2

d a(y ) y .

(2.2)

unless otherwise specied, we will also restrict our attention to the spatial
part of the target space-time for which f = da is nondegenerate, assuming
that the background allows such a decomposition. the full solution of the
equation of motion requires the boundary condition

1
2 gy  = f y .

(2.3)

now we approximate the spatial extent of the open string by a lattice
of two points, situated at the two boundaries and labeled accordingly. let
the width of the string be 2/. then spatial derivative y  is approximated
by 

2 (y2  y1), and the action (eq. 2.2) by

s = z d "

with parameters that are more suggestive for particle mechanics,

it is the action of a dipole of total mass m equally divided at two points linked
by a spring with hooke constant k. however, one also has to remember to

as usual we use g and g1 to lower, raise, and contract indices.

(2.12)

these are precisely the dirac brackets for coordinate elds on the string
boundaries found in [3].

it turns out to be instructive to use the variables

x  = (y 

2 + y 

1 )/2,

s = (y 

2  y 

1 )/2.

(2.13)

in term of them, the quantum commutation relations for the constrained
system are

[x , s] = 



1
2

(2.14)

(2.15)

but at the same time

[x , x ] = 0 = [s, s]

therefore the xs and the ss separately each make a complete set of com-
muting observables. since the xs are the center of mass coordinates of
the dipole system, that they commute seems at rst sight contrary to the
spirit of noncommutative geometry, yet we shall show presently that it is
precisely in terms of these commuting coordinates that a familiar type of
noncommutative algebra naturally emerges.

3 space noncommutativity

in [5] it is observed that type i string theory naturally gives rise to a noncom-
mutative product: imagine gluing the right end of one open string to the left
end of another give a new open string. this process is at once obviously non-
commutative but associative. it is also much in the spirit of the chan-paton
factors in resembling the multiplication of matrices through contraction of
adjacent covariant and contravariant indices:

(mn)a

b  m a

c n c
b .

open string elds, however, are big and unwieldy objects, and there are vary-
ing schemes to implement the actual product. however, any good product
should have one thing in common. it should be compatible with the open
string interacts, just as in eld theory pointwise product of elds (wavefunc-
tions) represent their pointwise interaction in a second quantized theory. all
purely open string interactions can be reduced to the process of two open
string joining together at one boundary and become another open string.
this is what a good product of open string elds should describe. what
happened to the interior of the strings must be complex and depend on

5

gauge choices, but at least the wavefunction dependence on two adjacent
end points gets contracted. on the other hand, in reducing the open string
to the dipole system (eq. 2.6), the end points are what is of the string. thus
string interaction induces a canonical product on the hilbert space h of the
dipole system.

because the xs form a complete set of commuting observables, states
in h space can be written as functions of them. to write out the sought
product, however, it is convenient to choose another basis. in light of (eq.
2.12), h has a tensor product structure h2  h1. hi is the hilbert space
associated with the i-th endpoint, furnishing a representation for yi in (eq.
2.12). h2 and h1 are canonically isomorphic. choosing a basis of states |zii
for hi, the product on h is dened by

(|z2i2  |z1i1)  (|z

2i2  |z

1i1)  (hz1||z

2i)|z2i2  |z

1i1.

(3.1)

the explicit calculation is carried out by rst choosing from the y2s a
maximal set of commuting operators {z2}. the corresponding operator {z1}
from the z1s is similarly a maximal commuting set in light of (eq. 2.12).
we also divide the xs into x = (z1 + z2)/2 and x being the rest. the
eigenstates of the zis furnish a set of basis for hi suitable for use in (eq.
3.1). using (eq. 2.12), one nd the conversion matrix between this and the
x basis that diagonalizes the xs:

hx|(|z2i2  |z1i1) = (x  (z2 + z1)/2) exp(cid:18) 

4

1

 x(z

2  z

1 )(cid:19).

(3.2)

using this, we nd the product in (eq. 3.1) is explicitly given by

x=x=x

.

(3.3)



x!1(x)2(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(1  2)[x] = exp  

2

 
x

it coincides with the star product studied by mathematicians in deformation
quantization.

this product structure also implies a map from a state (x) in h to an
operator  acting on h. this map is one-to-one but not onto. to see what
kind of operators one can obtain from a wavefunction (x), note that by (eq.
2.14) s is realized as an operator on h as follows:

s = 


2

 
x

6

(3.4)

therefore we can rewrite (eq. 3.3) as

(1  2)[x] = 1(x + s)2(x)  12(x)

with

  (y2) = (x + s).

(3.5)

(3.6)

being understood as an operator. it is easy to convince oneself that this map
is an algebra homomorphism:

12 = (1  2).

(3.7)

treating (eq. 3.3) as an operator  acting on the state 1 gives us an
analogous map

with the property

  (y1) = (x  s)

12 = (2  1).

(3.8)

(3.9)

in more abstract language, 1 and 2 act on the same module h from left
and right respectively. they always commute.

we can now deduce how gauge transformation would aect the con-
strained dipole. the action (eq. 2.6) by itself implies that under an in-
nitesimal transformation a  a + (x), the wavefunction changes its
phase by a position dependent exp(y2)(y1). the constraints (eq. 2.7)
change the story by making the y s noncommuting operators. under an
innitesimal , the wavefunction changes by

(x) = i(  )(x) = i((x)  (x)  (x)  (x)).

(3.10)

for nite ,

(x)  exp(x) (x)  exp((x)) = exp exp

 (x)

(3.11)

where

expf (x) 



xn=0

f (x)  f (x)     n times     f (x).

(3.12)

the originally abelian u(1) gauge group now becomes non-abelian.

on account that  is anti-symmetric, there is no operator ordering ambiguity in

writing 1(x + s), 2(y2), or the like.

4 remarks

after the work reported here had been completed and as the author was
preparing for a talk on it, a paper appeared [6] that discussed some related
issues and employed a quantum mechanical model resembling the one used
here but without the constraints (eq. 2.7).

just as the nal version of this paper is being made, another paper on
related subjects appeared on the archive [7]. among other issues, it studied
gauge bosons on d-branes with background b eld in relation to noncom-
mutative geometry. gauge boson physics is not touched upon in the present
paper because in throwing out all the bulk degrees of freedom to obtain (eq.
2.6) one removes all the oscillator parts of the string eld. hence only a
scalar particle, namely the tachyon, remains in (eq. 2.6). while its physics
is relatively simple, it can serve as a systematic and tractable probe for
noncommutative space in a way akin to how d0-branes can probe various
objects in string theory.
