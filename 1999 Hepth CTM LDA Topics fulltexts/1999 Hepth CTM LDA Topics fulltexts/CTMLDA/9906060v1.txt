abstract

this is a review article in which we will introduce, in a unifying fashion
and with more intermediate steps in some dicult calculations, two innite-
dimensional lie algebras of quantum matrix models, one for the open string
sector and one for the closed string sector. physical observables of quantum
matrix models in the large-n limit can be expressed as elements of these
lie algebras. we will see that both algebras arise as quotient algebras of a
larger lie algebra. we will also discuss some properties of these lie algebras
not published elsewhere yet, and briey review their relationship with well-
known algebras like the cuntz algebra, the witt algebra and the virasoro
algebra. we will also review how yangmills theory, various low energy
eective models of string theory, quantum gravity, string-bit models, and
quantum spin chain models can be formulated as quantum matrix models.
studying these algebras thus help us understand the common symmetry of
these physical systems.

1 introduction

as physicists, there are a number of phenomena in strong interaction, quan-
tum gravity and condensed matter physics which we want to understand.

quantum chromodynamics (qcd) is the widely accepted theory of strong
interaction. it postulates that the basic entities participating strong interac-
tion are quarks, antiquarks and gluons. in the high-energy regime, the theory
displays asymptotic freedom. the coupling among these entities becomes so
weak that we can use perturbative means to calculate experimentally mea-
surable quantities like dierential cross sections in particle reactions. indeed,
the excellent agreement between perturbative qcd and high energy particle
phenomena form the experimental basis of the theory.

nevertheless, strong interaction manifests itself not only in the high-
energy regime but also in the low-energy one. here, the strong coupling
constant becomes large. quarks, anti-quarks and gluons are permanently
conned to form bound states called hadrons, like protons and neutrons.
hadrons can be observed in laboratories. we can measure their charges,
spins, masses and other physical quantities. one challenging but important
problem in physics is to understand the structures of hadrons within the
framework of qcd; this serves as an experimental verication of qcd in the
low-energy regime. hadronic structure can be described by something called
a structure function which tells us the (fractional) numbers of constituent
quarks, antiquarks or gluons carrying a certain fraction of the total momen-
tum of the hadron. the structure function of a proton has been measured
carefully [1]. there has been no systematic theoretical attempt to explain
the structure function until very recently [2]1. in this work, the number of
colors n is taken to be innitely large as an approximation. the resulting
model can be treated as a classical mechanics [4, 5, 6]; i.e., the space of ob-
servables form a phase space of position and momentum, and the dynamics
of a point on this phase space is governed by the hamiltonian of this clas-
sical system and a poisson bracket2. this is because quantum uctuations
abate in the large-n limit  the green function of a product of color singlets
is dominated by the product of the green functions of these color singlets,

1see ref.[3] for a more pedagogical and updated account.
2ref.[7] provides an excellent discussion for such a geometric formulation of classical

mechanics.

and other terms are of subleading order3. it is possible to derive a poisson
bracket for yangmills theory in the large-n limit. this poisson bracket can
be incorporated into a commutative algebra of dynamical variables to form
something called a poisson algebra [10].

as an initial attempt, only quarks and anti-quarks in the qcd model
in ref.[2] are dynamical. a more realistic model should have dynamical
gluons in addition to quarks. gluons carry a sizeable portion of the total
momentum of a proton [1] and are thus signicant entities. one notable
feature of a gluon eld is that it is in the adjoint representation of the gauge
group and carries two color indices. these can be treated as row and column
indices of a matrix. this suggests gluon dynamics can be described by an
abstract model of matrices.

besides strong interaction phenomena, another fundamental question in
physics is how one quantizes gravity. the most promising solution to this
problem is superstring theory [11]. here we postulate that the basic dy-
namical entities are one-dimensional objects called strings. quarks, gluons,
gravitons and photons all arise as excitations of string states. if the theory
consists of bosonic strings only, the ground states will be tachyons. to re-
move tachyons, fermions are introduced into the theory in such a way that
there exists a symmetry between bosons and fermions. this bosonfermion
symmetry is called supersymmetry4 a superstring theory which is free of
quantum anomaly must be ten-dimensional. since we see only four macro-
scopic dimensions, the extra ones have to be compactied.

a partially non-perturbative treatment of superstring theory is through
entities called dp-branes [11]. they are extended objects spanning p dimen-
sions. open strings stretch between dp-branes in the remaining dimensions,
which are all compactied. there is a non-trivial background gauge eld
permeating the whole ten-dimensional space-time. the dynamics of the end
points of open strings can be regarded as the dynamics of dp-branes them-
selves, each of which behaves like space-time of p dimensions.

dierent versions of string theory were put forward in the 80s. lately,
evidence suggests that there exist duality relationship among these dierent

3for an introductory discussion on this point, see refs.[8] and [9].
4supersymmetry could also be viewed as a symmetry which unies, in a non-trivial
manner, the space-time symmetry described by the poincare group, and the local gauge
symmetry at each point of space-time. the symmetry between bosons and fermions then
come as a corollary. see refs.[12] or [13] for further details.

versions of string theory and so there is actually only one theory for strings.
the most fundamental formulation of string theory is called m(atrix)-theory
[14]. currently, there is a widely-believed m-theory conjecture which states
that in the innite momentum frame (a frame in which the momentum of
a physical entity in one dimension is very large), m-theory [14] can be de-
scribed by the quantum mechanics of an innite number n of point-like
d0-branes, the dynamics of which is in turn described by a matrix model
with supersymmetry.

besides the m-theory conjecture, there are a number of dierent ways of
formulating the low-energy dynamics of superstring theory as supersymmet-
ric matrix models [11].

we can use matrix models to describe condensed matter phenomena, too.
one major approach condensed matter physicists use to understand high-tc
superconductivity, quantum hall eect and superuidity is to mimic them
by integrable models like the hubbard model [15].
(this is a model for
strongly correlated electron systems. its hamiltonian consists of some terms
describing electron hopping from site to site, and a term which suppresses
the tendency of two electrons to occupy the same site. we will write down
the one-dimensional version of this model in a later section.) it turns out
that the hubbard model and many other integrable models can actually be
formulated as matrix models with or without supersymmetry.

thus matrix models provide us a unifying formalism for a vast variety of
physical phenomena. now, we would like to propose an algebraic approach
to matrix models. the centerpiece of the classical mechanical model of qcd
in refs.[6] and [2] is a poisson algebra. we can write the hamiltonian as an
element of this poisson algebra, and can describe the dynamics of hadrons and
do calculations through it. in string theory, the string is a one-dimensional
object and so it sweeps out a two-dimensional surface called a worldsheet
as time goes by. worldsheet dynamics possesses a remarkable symmetry
called conformal symmetry  the lagrangian is invariant under an invertible
mapping of worldsheet coordinates x  x which leaves the worldsheet metric
tensor g(x) invariant up to a scale, i.e., g
(x) = (x)g(x), where (x)
is a non-zero function of worldsheet coordinates. this invertible mapping is
called the conformal transformation. it turns out that the conformal charges,
i.e., the conserved charges associated with conformal symmetry, in particular
the hamiltonian of bosonic string theory, can be written as elements of a lie
algebra called the virasoro algebra [16, 17]. through the virasoro algebra,

4

we learn a lot about string theory like the mass spectrum and the s-matrix
elements.

the relationship between conformal symmetry and the virasoro algebra
illustrates one powerful approach to physics  identify the symmetry of a
physical system, express the symmetry in terms of an algebra, and use the
properties of the algebra to work out the physical behavior of the system.
sometimes, the symmetry of the physical system is so perfect that it com-
pletely determines the key properties of the system.

the above argument suggests that we may get fruitful discovery in gluon
dynamics, m-theory and superconductivity if there is a lie algebra for a
generic matrix model, and we are able to write its hamiltonian in terms of
this lie algebra, which expresses a new symmetry in physics.

2 formalism and examples of quantum ma-

trix models in the large-n limit

examples of quantum matrix models fall into three broad classes: yangmills
theory, string theory and one-dimensional quantum spin systems.

it should be obvious why yangmills theory can be expressed as a quan-
tum matrix model. identify the trivial vacuum state |0i with respect to the
annihilation operators characterized by eq.(1) below, i.e., the action of any
of these annihilation operators on this vacuum state yields 0. a typical phys-
ical state is a linear combination of traces of products of creation operators
acting on this vacuum state. (in the context of yangmills theory, this is
a color-singlet state of a single meson or glueball.) a typical observable is
a linear combination of the trace of a product of creation and annihilation
operators. naively, we may think that the ordering of these operators is
arbitrary, depending on the details of that physical model only. actually,
the planar property of the large-n limit [18] comes into play here, and only
those traces in which all creation operators come to the left of all annihila-
tion operators survive the large-n limit. moreover, the large-n limit brings
about a dramatic simplication of the action of this collective operator on a
physical state  the unique trace of a product of creation operators acting
on the vacuum will not be broken up into a product of more than one trace of
products of creation operators acting on the vacuum, and it is not possible

5

for a product of more than one trace of products of creation operators to
merge into just one trace of products of creation operators. in other words,
an observable propagates a color-singlet state into a linear combination of
color-singlet states [19].

this explains why we can mimic a string as a collection of string bits. in
this context, a physical state is a string, open or closed, and the concluding
statement of the previous paragraph implies that an observable replaces a
segment of the string with another segment, without breaking it and with-
out joining several strings together. this is a desirable simplifying feature
for some string models. an important feature of this string-bit model is that
wherever this segment lies on the string, it will be replaced by the new seg-
ment at exactly the same location. in other words, the action of an observable
involves neighbouring string bits only, and is translationally invariant with
respect to the string.

this brings us to quantum spin chain models. since the two most impor-
tant properties of a quantum spin chain model is that a spin interacts with
neighbouring spins (not necessarily nearest neighbouring spins though) only,
and the interaction is translationally invariant, we can write down a typical
quantum spin chain model as a quantum matrix model in the large-n limit,
so long as the boundary conditions match.

we are going to present these ideas systematically in this section.
first of all, we will present an abstract formalism of quantum matrix
models. we will then use a yangmills theory with only bosonic adjoint
matter elds to serve as a generic example to show how yangmills theo-
ries with dierent matter contents are expressed as quantum matrix models.
next, we will turn to string theory, and see the various ways quantum matrix
models are related to it. finally, we will present a formal way of transcribing
a quantum spin chain system into a quantum matrix model in the large-n
limit, and give some examples from bosonic spin systems. since many of
them are known to be exactly integrable, and have even been exactly solved,
we thus give here some examples of quantum matrix models, with or without
supersymmetry, which are exactly integrable or even exactly solved. these
models either involve cyclically symmetric spin chains satisfying the periodic
boundary condition, or involve open spin chains satisfying open boundary
conditions.

2.1 formulation of quantum matrix models in the

large-n limit

let us give a unifying and more comprehensive review of the formulation
of quantum matrix models in our previous papers [20, 21]. the multi-index
notations introduced in appendix a of ref.[20] and that of ref.[21] will be
used extensively. the reader can understand these two appendices without
reading the main texts of those two references.

think of the row and column indices of those annihilation and creation
operators as the row and column indices of an element in u(n). we will call
them color indices, as this is the case in yangmills theory (subsection 2.2).
let a1
2(k) be an annihilation operator of a boson in the adjoint representation
for 1  k  . (here  is a positive integer.) let () be an annihilation
operator of a fermion in the fundamental representation for 1    f .
(here f is also a positive integer.) lastly, let () be an annihilation
operator of a fermion in the conjugate representation. we will call k and 
quantum states other than color. the corresponding creation operators are
a1
() and () with appropriate values for k and . we will say
2 (k), 
that these operators create an adjoint parton, a fundamental parton and a
conjugate parton, respectively. most of these operators commute with one
another except the following non-trivial cases:

there are two families of physical states (or color-invariant states in the
context of gauge theory). one family consists of linear combinations of states
of the form

c+1(2)|0i.

(kc)

c+1

1 (k1)3

here we use the capital letter k to denote the integer sequence k1, k2, . . . , kc.
unless otherwise specied, the summation convention applies to all repeated

7

color indices throughout this whole review. we will justify the use of the
notation  later. this term carries a factor of n raised to a certain power
(the proof that this is the
to make its norm nite in the large-n limit.
correct power is similar to that given in appendix a in which we will prove
a closely related statement.) we will call these open singlet states. these
are open string states in string-bit model. the other family consists of linear
combinations of states of the form

k  n c/22

1 (k1)3

2 (k2)   1

c (kc)|0i.

(5)

these are closed singlet states. these are closed string states in string-bit
model. this state is manifestly cyclic:

k1k2 = k2k1.

(6)

figs.1(a) and (b) show a typical open singlet state, whereas figs.1(c) and
(d) show a typical closed singlet state.

now let us construct physical operators acting on these singlet states. it
turns out that there are ve families of them. the rst family consists of
nite linear combinations of operators of the form

 a+1(3) 

(7)

1(2)a1

2(j1)   a b

where a = #( i) and b = #( j). we say that this is an operator of the rst
kind. figs. 2(a) and (b) show the diagrammatic representations of this family
of operators. in the planar large-n limit, a typical term of an operator of
the rst kind propagates an open singlet state to another open singlet state:

however, it annihilates a closed singlet state:

4 (cid:16)k(cid:17) = 0.

(8)

we can visualize eq.(8) in fig. 2(c). the fact that this operator does not
split a singlet state into a product of singlet states, and it does not combine
a product of singlet states together to form a singlet state has been known

figure 1: (a) a typical open singlet state in detail. it consists of the creation
operators of a conjugate parton of the quantum state 1, four adjoint partons
of the quantum states k1, k2, k3 and k4, and a fundamental parton of the
quantum state 2. these creation operators are represented by a solid square
at the top, four solid circles in the middle, and a solid square at the bottom,
respectively. all these operators carry color indices. if two circles, or a circle
and a square, are joined by a solid line, then the two corresponding operators
share a color index, all possible values of which we sum over, regardless of
how thick the solid line is. the arrow indicates the direction of the integer

figure 2: (a) a typical operator of the rst kind. on the left, there is a solid
square representing the creation operator of a conjugate parton with the quan-
tum state 1. below it are two solid circles representing the creation operators
of adjoint partons with the quantum states i1 and i2. at the bottom is another
solid circle representing the creation operator of a fundamental parton with
the quantum state 3; on the right, there is a hollow square representing the
annihilation operator of a conjugate parton with the quantum state 2. be-
low it are four hollow cirlces representing the annihilation of adjoint partons
with the quantum states j1, j2, j3 and j4. at the bottom is another hollow
square representing the annihilation operator of a fundamental parton with
the quantum state 4. again two circles, or a circle and a square, are joined
by a solid or thin line whenever the corresponding operators share a common
color index with all possible values. the arrows indicate the directions of the
integer sequences i and j. notice that
j is put in reverse. (b) an operator
of the rst kind in brief. the sequence of creation operators is simplied to
a thick line, and the sequence of annihilation operators is simplied to a thin

with the numbers of creation or annihilation operators they carry. (c) the
action of an operator of the rst kind on the adjoint parton portion of an
open singlet state (eq.(8)). the dotted lines connect the line segments to be
annihilated together. this action produces an open singlet state as shown
on the right of the arrow.

j  is the reverse of

10

for a long time [19], and is ultimately related to the planarity of the large-n
limit [18]. we will provide a non-rigorous diagrammatic proof of this fact in
appendix a, where we work on the action of an operator of the second kind
(to be dened below) on an open singlet state. the reader can easily work
out the actions of operators of other kinds by the same reasoning.

eq.(8) justies the use of the direct product symbol . this equation
2 acts as a ff matrix on the vector 5 in a f -dimensional
shows that 1
j acts as an innite-dimensional matrix on the vector s k in an
space, f i
innite-dimensional space, and l3
l4 acts as another f  f matrix on the
vector 6 in another f -dimensional space. thus an operator of the rst
kind is an element of the direct product gl(f )  f  gl(f ). here, gl(f )
is the lie algebra of the general linear group gl(2f ), and the innite-
dimensional lie algebra f spanned by f i
j is isomorphic to the inductive
limit gl+ of the gl(n)s as n  .

on the r.h.s. of this equation, there will only be a nite number of non-
zero terms in the sum (bounded by the number of ways of splitting k into
k is
subsequence), so there is no problem of convergence. for example, if
shorter than j, the right hand side will vanish. we can visualize this equation
in fig. 3(c). this equation shows why we can treat this operator as a direct
product of the operators 1
j and the identity operator. the rst operator
acts as a f  f matrix on 3s, the second one acts on s k, whereas the
last one acts trivially on 4s. this operator annihilates a closed singlet
state:

we will say more about the mathematical properties of these physical
operators in later sections.

how these physical states and operators show up in actual physical systems,
starting with yangmills theory.

2.2 examples: yangmills theory

the simplest example for this class of models is 2-dimensional yangmills
theory with adjoint matter elds. for the sake of pedagogy, we will give a
detailed exposition below. the following presentation is closely parallel to
ref.[22]. as will be shown below, there is no dynamics for the gauge bosons
in 2 dimensions. the quantum matrices in the above abstract formalism is
realized as canonically quantized adjoint matter elds. dierent matrices
carry dierent momenta. the linear momentum and hamiltonian of the
model can be expressed as linear combinations of the ve families of operators
introduced above.

we need a number of preliminary denitions. let g be the yangmills
coupling constant,  and  ordinary space-time indices, a a yangmills
potential and  a scalar eld in the adjoint representation of the gauge group
u(n), and m the mass of this scalar eld. both  and a are n  n
hermitian matrix elds.
if we treat the yangmills potential as the lie-
algebraically valued connection form and  a ber on the base manifold
of space-time in the language of dierential geometry5, then the covariant
derivative is

the minkowski space action of this model is

d =  + i [a, ] .

bundle is ref.[23]. however, readers who are not interested in dierential geometry may
well take the covariant derivative to be given shortly for granted.

is the longitudinal momentum current. note that a+ has no time dependence
in eq.(24) and so the gauge eld is not dynamical at all in the light-cone
gauge. let us split a+ into its zero mode a+,0 (this is a mode which is
independent of x.) and non-zero mode a+,n, i.e.,

the lagrange constraints for them are

a+ = a+,0 + a+,n.

z dxj + = 0, and

2
a+,n  g2j + = 0,

(25)

respectively. now we can use these two equations to eliminate a+ in eq.(24)

(31)

if the annihilation and creation operators here satisfy the canonical com-
mutation relation eq.(1), except that the kroneckar delta function k1k2 in
eq.(1) is replaced with the dirac delta function (k1  k2) here, then the
adjoint matter eld will satisfy eq.(30). a state can be built out of a series
of creation operators acting on the trivial vacuum, and it takes the form

1 (k+

1 )a2

2 (k+

2 )   ac

c (k+

however, in general this state does not satisfy the lagrangian constraint
eq.(25). only those of the form given in eq.(5) satisfy this constraint. we
thus obtain a model whose physical states are the physical states introduced
in the previous subsection.

using eqs.(28) and (30), we can quantize the light-cone momentum and

get

p + = z

(32)

where k
k is dened in eq.(16). we have dropped the superscript + in k
to simplify the notation. this is a concrete example in which a physical
observable is expressed as a linear combination of the operators introduced
in the previous section. (here k can take on an innite number of values, and
the regulator   . nonetheless, taking the regulator to innity has an
inuence on technical details only, since we are talking about a eld theory
without divergences in this limit.) to obtain a similar formula for the light-
cone hamiltonian, we need to express, in momentum space, the longitudinal
momentum current as a quantum operator rst. dene the longitudinal
momentum current in momentum space to be

eq.(36) shows that the light-cone hamiltonian is a linear combination of
operators of the fourth kind.

the above formalism can be easily generalized to dierent cases. studying
glueballs in quantum chromodynamics [24] requires the incorporation of more
than one adjoint matter elds. take the large-n limit as an approximation
for pure yangmills theory. if we assume that the gluon eld, i.e., the gauge
eld, is not dependent on the transverse dimensions (in other words, we
take dimensional reduction as a further approximation), the gluon eld will
precisely be the adjoint matter elds. the number of adjoint matter elds is
the same as the number of transverse dimensions in the system.

to study mesons, we need to include fundamental and conjugate matter
elds [25]. they will serve as quark and antiquark elds, respectively. the
reader can nd the expressions for the light-cone momentum and hamiltonian
of a dimensionally reduced model of mesons in terms of the rst four kinds
of operators in ref.[20].

2.3 examples: quantum gravity and string theory

there are several ways to study quantum gravity and its most promising
candidate, string theory, in terms of quantum matrix models. one idea is
based on the crucial observation that the dual of a feynman diagram can be
taken as a triangulation of a plannar surface, which serves as a lattice approx-
imation to a geometrical surface. the partition function for two-dimensional
quantum gravity can then be approximated by a matrix model in the large-n
limit [26, 27]. whether the matrix model is classical or quantum, and the
exact form of its action depends on what the conformal matter eld coupled
to quantum gravity is. this, in turn, is equivalent to a string theory with
certain dimensions [28]. this approach has the virtue that it reveals some
non-perturbative behavior of string theory. for example, a 3-dimensional
non-critical string theory is equivalent to a model of two-dimensional quan-
tum gravity coupled with conformal matter with the conformal charge c = 2.
then this model of quantum gravity is further mapped to a one-matrix model
in the large-n limit with 3 interaction, i.e., the action of this matrix model
is

2

1
2

2 

1
3n

 +

s = z d2xtr  1

3! ,
where  is an n  n matrix, and  and  are constants.
the second way is to consider the low-energy dynamics of string theory
if we exclude all feynman diagrams with more than
[11]. for example,
one loop in a bosonic open string theory with n chanpaton factors, we
will retain only a tachyonic matrix eld  with three-tachyon coupling, and
yangmills gauge bosons minimally coupled to tachyons. the action is

(37)

s =

2 tr(2) +

3s 2

 tr(3)

(38)

where  is the regge slope, and g is the gauge boson coupling constant.

the third way is to approximate a string by a collection of string bits
[29]. a closed singlet state then represents a closed string, and an open
singlet state represents an open string.

22

the fourth way is to consider the low-energy dynamics of dp-branes [11].
let 1, 2, . . . , and p be the coordinates inside the p-brane. the action
turns out to be another matrix model:

s = tpz dp+1e [det(gab + bab + 2fab)]1/2 ,

where tp is the brane tension,

and

gab() =

x 
a

x 
b g(x())

bab() =

x 
a

x 
b b(x())

(39)

(40)

(41)

are the induced metric and antisymmetric tensor on the brane, and fab is
the background yangmills eld. if supersymmetry is incorporated into the
theory, and if we further assume that spacetime is essentially at, the action
shown in eq.(39) will be turned into a supersymmetric yangmills theory.

closely related to the d-brane action is the m-theory conjecture and the
matrix string corollary. according to this corollary, the action of type-iia
string theory in the innite momentum frame is given by the matrix form of
the greenschwarz action [30].

the presence of a multitude of methods to transcribe string theory to

matrix models shows their intimate relationship.

2.4 examples: quantum spin chains

quantum spin chain systems form another major class of models which can
be expressed as quantum matrix models. there are various reasons to study
quantum spin chain systems. the essence of many condensed matter and
high energy phenomena are captured by them. for example, we can use the
ising model to study ferromagnetism, lattice gas, order-disorder phase tran-
sition [31], lattice quantum gravity and even string theory [32]. in addition,
the integrability of these models provides rich insight in pure mathematics
like quantum groups and knot theory [10]. the bethe ansatz [33] and the
closely related yangbaxter equations [34, 35] are well known to be power-
ful tools in studying and exactly solving many of these spin chain systems.

23

these tools provide us a way to determine the integrability of and solve the
associated quantum matrix models. a better knowledge in quantum ma-
trix models should thus help us understand exactly integrable models and
condensed matter systems better, and vice versa.

there is a one-to-one correspondence between spin chain systems whose
collective spin chain states are cyclically symmetric and satisfy the periodic
boundary condition, spin chain systems satisfying open boundary conditions,
and quantum matrix systems in the large-n limit. (a connection between
spin systems and matrix models was observed previously in ref.[36].) we will
illustrate the idea using the simplest spin chain model, the one-dimensional
quantum ising model satisfying the periodic boundary condition [37, 38, 39].
a typical collective state of the whole spin chain can be characterized by
a sequence of c 2-dimensional column vectors, where c is the number of
sites in the spin chain. spin-up and spin-down states at the p-th site are
characterized by the p-th column vectors

0 ! and   0
  1

1 ! ,

respectively. a cyclically symmetric spin chain state can be constructed by
summing over all cyclic permutations of this sequence of c column vectors.
the hamiltonian h spin

at dierent sites (i.e., with dierent subscripts) commute with each other.
moreover, they satisfy the periodic boundary condition  x,y,z

c+1 =  x,y,z

.

we can paraphrase the model in terms of the states and operators of
quantum matrix models as follows. a closed singlet state corresponds to a
cyclically symmmetric spin chain state. we allow the existence of only one
each adjoint parton corresponds to a spin. there are 2 possible quantum
states (i.e.,  = 2) other than color for an adjoint parton. a(1) (color indices
are suppressed) corresponds to a spin-up state, whereas a(2) corresponds
to a spin-down state. therefore a typical collective state of a cyclically

24

symmetric spin chain can be denoted by k, where k is an integer sequence
of c numbers, each of which is either 1 or 2.

let us turn to the hamiltonian in eq.(42). consider the operator  x

column vectors, respectively, into

(2, 1) or (2, 2), then they will be replaced with (2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 2) or (1, 1),

(45)

let us underscore that the matrix model dened by the hamiltonian h matrix
in eqs.(44) or (45) is an integrable matrix model in the large-n limit.

ising

notice that the hamiltonian of the ising spin chain model possesses trans-
lationally invariant terms which describe nearest neighbour interactions only.
in general, any spin chain model which possesses the same kind of terms can
be transcribed to a quantum matrix model in the large-n limit by the equa-
tion

where x ij
if the spin chain

state at the p-th state is j, then it is changed to i; otherwise, the operator
annihilates the spin chain state and we get 0. the reader can take a look
at refs.[40] or [21] for some more examples of exactly integrable quantum
matrix models obtained from exactly integrable spin chain models satisfying
the periodic boundary condition.

there is also a one-to-one correspondence between open spin chains and
quantum matrix models in the large-n limit. the relation between a  and
hubbard operators is almost the same as that in eq.(46), except that the
summation index p runs from 1 to c  a + 1 this time. it can be easily seen
that the corresponding hubbard operators for an li

and integrable supersymmetric quantum matrix models [42].

3 a lie algebra for open strings

as we have just been seen in the previous chapter, quantum matrix models
in the large-n limit are of very wide applicability in physics. this leads us
naturally to the following question: can we do something more in addition to
writing down the physical observables of these models as linear combinations
of the operators introduced in subsection 2.1? one major milestone in un-
derstanding the physics of these models will be to obtain the spectra of some
of these observables, or at least to obtain their key qualitative properties.

a number of systematic analytic approaches have been developed to solve
classical matrix models in the large-n limit, another class of models widely
used in physics [43, 44, 45]. on the other hand, the method employed for
studying the spectra of the hamiltonians of various versions of yangmills
theory in recent years is numerical in nature (e.g., ref.[22]). a lot of ef-
fort has been spent to develop more accurate and sophisticated numerical
analysis, and we have a fairly large body of knowledge in the numerical
solutions of these quantum matrix models.
it should be nice to see how
much this approach can tell us about the various interesting physical sys-
tems. nonetheless, it should also be nice if we have several other approaches
to the same problem; some results which may be dicult to obtain in one
approach may be pretty trivial in another. a combination of the knowledge
gained from dierent approaches can lead us to much deeper understandings
of the physics.

27

in section 1, we indicated that understanding the symmetry of a physical
system can lead to the elucidation of important features of it. this provides
us another approach: what is the symmetry of quantum matrix models?
a continuous symmetry in physics is usually expressed as a lie group, or
its innitesimal form, a lie algebra.
is there a lie algebra for quantum
matrix models? or more specically speaking, are the physical observables
of quantum matrix models elements of a lie algebra?

yes, such a lie algebra exists.
indeed, we introduced two lie algebras, the grand (open string) algebra
and the algebra c, for open and closed bosonic strings in refs.[20] and [21],
respectively. the fact that we can give a unifying account of all quantum
observables for open and closed singlet states suggests that there may be
a way to treat these two lie algebras on an equal footing.
in fact, they
are quotient algebras of a bigger algebra which in turn is a subalgebra of
a precursor algebra. some familiarity of the grand open string algebra and
c, however, is necessary to see how this works. we will therefore review a
hierachy of subalgebras and quotient algebras, from the simplest to the most
non-trivial, of a simplied version of the grand open string algebra in which
there are only one degree of freedom for the fermion in the fundamental rep-
resentation, and one degree of freedom for the anti-fermion in the conjugate
representation. we will also derive some results about the structure of these
algebras not published elsewhere.

another point worthy mentioning here is that these algebras are related
intimately with the cuntz algebra [46, 47] and the witt algebra [48, 49,
50], the central extension of which is the virasoro algebra [16]. further
understandings of these well-known algebras can help us a lot in explaining
the physics of quantum matrix models.

after acquiring some expertise in this kind of lie algebraic arguments,
we will study the full algebra, the grand string algebra, for all ve kinds of
operators, and some more subalgebras of it in subsequent sections.

3.1 operators of the first three kinds

we will review what we have learnt so far about the lie algebras for the op-
erators of the rst three kinds in ref.[20] which will be useful in constructing
the grand string algebra later, and state some other properties of them which
have not been published yet.

28

the adjoint matter portion of the operators of the rst kind form a lie

algebra with the following lie bracket

j , f k
hf i

j f i
l i =  k

l   i

lf k
j .

(51)

this lie algebra f can be derived from the commutator of the associative
algebra of these operators. f is isomorphic to gl+, the lie algebra, with
the usual bracket, of all complex matrices (aij)i,j  z+ such that the number
of nonzero aij is nite. the isomorphism is given by a one-one correspondence
between the multi-indices i and the set of natural numbers z+r, for example
by a lexicographic ordering6.

operators of the second kind form another lie algebra. this is again the

commutator of an associative algebra with the multiplication law

the rst three terms on the r.h.s. of eq.(53) are diagrammatically repre-
sented in fig.7. we will call the lie algebra dened by eq.(53) the leftix
algebra or l. (we justify this name as an abbreviation of left multi-matrix
algebra.)

6this is a total ordering > among integer sequences such that i > j for the sequences

i and j if either

1. #( i) > #( j ); or
2. #( i) = #( j ) = a 6= 0, and there exists an integer r  a such that i1 = j1, i2 = j2,

. . . , ir1 = jr1 and ir > jr.

explicitly, the total ordering can be presented as

 < 1 < 2 <  <  < 11 < 12 <  < 1
< 21 <  < 1 <  <  < 111  .

to understand the properties of this lie algebra better, let us determine
its cartan subalgebra and the root spaces with respect to this cartan sub-
algebra. we will follow the denition of the cartan subalgebra given by
humphreys [51]. to understand this denition, we need a number of prelim-
inary notions. let l be a lie algebra. dene the descending central series by
l0 = l, l1 = [l,l], l2 = [l,l1], . . . , li = [l,li1]. l is called nilpotent
if ln = 0 for some n. the normalizer of a subalgebra k of l is dened
by nl(k) = {x  l|[x,k]  k}. a cartan subalgebra of a lie algebra l
is a nilpotent subalgebra which is equal to its normalizer in l. a cartan
subalgebra of a lie algebra is a nilpotent subalgebra of it such that the nor-
malizer of the nilpotent subalgebra is the nilpotent subalgebra itself. it turns
out that all vectors of the form l i
i , where i is either empty or an arbitrary
nite integer sequence of integers between 1 and  inclusive, span a cartan
subalgebra of the algebra l. the proof of this proposition can be found in
appendix c.

this also gives a one-one correspondence (counting rule) between the set of values of the
indices and the set of natural numbers:   1, 1  2, . . . ,    + 1, 1   + 2, etc..

is

as a result, every f k

root vectors of the algebra l. a proof that there are no root vectors other
than the f k
l will be provided in appendix d. we therefore conclude that
every root space is one-dimensional.

moreover, l and l are the extended cuntzlie algebra and the cuntzlie
algebra, respectively.

we can get further insight of l and l by considering the special case
 = 1. then all integer sequences are repetitions of the number 1 a number
of times. we can then simplify the notations and write s k as s#( k) and l i
j
as l#( i)

as in an earlier discussion, the subspace f1 spanned by all the vectors of
d form a proper ideal of this  = 1 algebra l1. we can deduce

the form f c
from eq.(56) that

hl a

di = (b  c)f a+ cb

(62)

0 + f and l0

we can now form the quotient algebra of cosets of the form v + f, where v
is an arbitrary vector of the algebra l1. this quotient algebra is spanned by
the cosets l a
b + f1, where a and b run over all 0, 1,   ,. it is
straightforward to show that the following lie brackets hold:
hl a
0 + f1, l c
hl a
0 + f1, l0
hl0
b + f1, l0

0 + f1i = f1;
d + f1i = f1; and
d + f1i = f1.

(63)

32

therefore, this quotient algebra is an abelian algebra.

the relationship between l and the cuntz algebra acquires a new mean-
1. a and a are the building

0 and a  l0

ing in this special case. let a  l1

b = (cid:16)a(cid:17) a

a and a satisfy

aa = 1.

(64)

(65)

this is the dening relation for the toeplitz algebra [52]. note that the com-
mutator between a and a is a nite-rank operator, the projection operator
to the vacuum state. thus if we quotient the toeplitz algebra by f1, we will
get an abelian algebra generated by the operators satisfying

aa = 1,

and aa = 1.

(66)

this is just the algebra of functions on a circle, and is consistent with the
fact that the quotient algebra characterized by eq.(63) is abelian. thus
we can regard the cuntz algebra as a non-commutative multi-dimensional
generalization of the algebra of functions on the circle.

the lie algebra r spanned by the operators of the third kind is similar

to l. its lie bracket is

a vector in f can be expressed as an element in r as well:

all the operators of the rst three kinds together form a bigger lie algebra
m. this lie algebra embraces all the ones discussed so far as subalgebras.
the additional lie bracket needed is one between an operator of the second
kind and that of the third kind, as shown:

verifying that the action of the r.h.s. on an arbitrary open singlet state s m
j s m ) is not enough to validate this binary operation
gives l i
between these two operators as a lie bracket because eqs.(54) and (68)
together imply that the set of all nite linear combinations of the operators
in l and r is not linearly independent, which in turn implies that the
jacoby identity may not be satised. we will properly justify eq.(70) in the
section 3, where we will see that we can treat m as a subalgebra of yet
another larger lie algebra. a typical term in the above equation is depicted

it is impossible to nd a nite linear combination of this
kind of operators whose action on an arbitrary singlet state is exactly the
same as the composite operator i

because we are going to prove a similar but more general statement in the
next section in appendix g.) nevertheless, a remarkable thing here is that
the lie bracket between two operators of the fourth kind can still be equated
with a nite linear combination of this kind of operators by the requirement

tion of how we carry out computations involving multi-indices. fig.10 gives
diagrammatic representations of the rst nine terms. we will call the lie
algebra dened by eq.(73) the centrix algebra .

let us explore the structure of . all vectors of the form i

i , where i
is an arbitrary nite integer sequence of integers between 1 and  inclusive,
span a cartan subalgebra 0
 of the centrix algebra. the proof is pretty
much the same as the one shown in appendix c.

eqs.(79), (80) and (81) are illustrated in figs.11, 12 and 13, respectively. it
follows from these three equations that the quotient algebra v  / m 
 is
the lie algebra of a set of outer derivations of the cuntz algebra. as we have
shown in ref.[20], v simplies precisely to the witt algebra in the special
case  = 1. thus, the lie algebra of this set of outer derivations of the cuntz
algebra is a generalization of the algebra of vector elds on the unit circle.

4 open string and closed string algebras

in the previous section, we studied a lie algebra for bosonic open strings,
and gained some expertise in how to study its structure. we will use this
skill to fulll our promise in the preceding section, which is to study the full
lie algebra for open and closed strings, or in other words, the lie algebra for
the ve kinds of operators discussed in section 2.1.

to achieve this purpose, we need to dene a precursor lie algebra which
we will call the heterix algebra among some physical operators. these physi-
cal operators are nothing but the ones dened in subsection 2.1, except that
the ranges of values of the quantum states other than color (see the sec-
ond paragraph in subection 2.1) are changed. we will derive this algebra in
subsection 4.1. then the grand string algebra will be seen as a subalgebra
of the heterix algebra. readers who are only interested in the denition of
this algebra may skip this section. occasionally returning to it to look up
the relevant denitions. in subsection 4.2, we will give the denition of a
algebra of operators acting on open and closed singlet states. we will call
this the grand string algebra. the dierence between this lie algebra and
the precursor algebra is that there are more than one degree of freedom at
the ends of the open singlet states. at rst glance, this algebra is somewhat
larger than the precursor algebra. ironically, we will derive this grand string
algebra as a subalgebra of the precursor algebra by manipulating the numbers
of degrees of freedom in an accompanying appendix.

 , then ik2 > j k2 =

40

in subection 4.3, we will derive a lie algebra just for open strings. this
will be a quotient algebra of the grand string algebra.
in section 4.4, we
will derive a lie algebra for closed strings as another quotient algebra of
the grand string algebra. we will see that the corresponding lie algebra,
which we will call the cyclix algebra, for bosonic closed strings has a closed
relationship with the witt algebra, too.

to have a glimpse of how to use these algebras in the study of physical
systems, we will turn to the ising model again in section 4.5. it is well known
that there are many ways of solving the quantum ising model in one dimen-
sion. one method which is close to the spirit of the original way onsager
himself solved the model [37] is via the onsager algebra [53]. we will see
that actually this onsager algebra is a subalgebra of the cyclix algebra, and
we can use the cyclix algebra directly to obtain some conserved quantities of
the ising matrix model. this example may give us a clue of how to use these
lie algebras more eectively in the future.

4.1 derivation of a precursor algebra

we are going to derive a precursor algebra. the grand string algebra will be
identied as a subalgebra of this algebra in the next section.

let 

 (k) be an annihilation operator for a boson in the adjoint represen-
tation for 1  k   + 2f , and let  and  be annihilation operators for
an antifermion in the conjugate representation and a fermion in the funda-
mental representation, respectively. moreover, let 
 be the
corresponding creation operators. the annihilation and creation operators
satisfy the usual canonical (anti)-commutation relations, the non-vanishing
ones being

(c.f. eqs.(2) and (3) in ref.[21]). the set of all f i
j s is linearly
independent. this was proved in appendix a of ref.[21]. (notice that the
open singlet states are needed for the linear independence.
if we simply
considered their actions on closed singlet states only, the set would not be
linear independent.)

j s and i

the next thing we are going to do is to construct a precursor lie algebra
out of the two families of color-invariant operators. if the product of any two
of these operators were well dened, i.e., if we could write down the product
as a nite linear combination of color-invariant operators, the easiest way
to obtain a lie algebra would certainly be to dene the lie bracket of two
operators as a sum or dierence of their products in dierent orders of the
operators. however, such a product is actually not well dened; this is shown
in appendix g. now consider the commutator of two operators. it can be
shown that the actions of these commutators on singlet states are identical
to the actions of some observables. if we dene the commutator to be the
color-invariant operator whose action on t 
c is identical to it, then we

ators in m , in general we will obtain a color-invariant operator of the
form tr(                 )   tr(          ) multi-
plied by a factor of n raised to some power. however, figs. 14(b), (c)

4.2 denition of the grand string algebra

we are going to give a precise denition of a lie algebra of the operators
dened in section 2.1 acting on closed or open singlet states. unlike the
open singlet states in section 4.1, the numbers of degrees of freedom of the
fundamental and conjugate elds are arbitrary. the proof that this is really
a lie algebra will be given in appendix h.

consider a vector space of all nite linear combinations of all ve families

of operators listed in table 1.

in this table, 1  1, 2, 3, and 4  f , i and j are non-empty
sequences of integers between 1 and  inclusive, and i and j are empty or
non-empty sequences of integers also between 1 and  inclusive. the reader
can regard the ve types of vectors as operators dened in eq.(129), or as
axiomatic entities satisfying a set of lie brackets to be described immediately.
we call a vector or an operator an operator of the rst, second, third, fourth
or fth kind if it is a nite linear combination of operators, all of which are
of the rst, second, third, fourth or fth form enlisted above, respectively.

let us describe the lie brackets among dierent kinds of operators. the

we call the lie algebra dened by the lie brackets from eqs.(97) to (103)

the grand string algebra.

let to be the vector space of all nite linear combinations of singlet states
of the form 1  s k  2 where 1  1, 2  f and all integers are between
1 and  inclusive in k, which may be empty. also let tc be the vector
space of all nite linear combinations of singlet states of the form k such
that all integers are again between 1 and  inclusive in k, which has to be
non-empty, and that k satises eq.(6). if we treat the operators to  tc
as the ones dened in the subsection 4.1, we will nd that the actions of an
operator of the rst kind are precisely given by eqs.(8) and (9); those of the
second kind by eqs.(11) and (12); those of the third kind by eqs.(14) and
(15); those of the fourth kind by eqs.(17) and (18); and those of the fth
kind by eqs.(21) and (22). alternatively, we can dene the actions of the
operators of the ve kinds on to  tc by these ten equations, and show that
to  tc provides a representation for this lie algebra.

4.3 open string algebra

now that we have the grand string algebra at hand, we are going to derive
the lie algebra of operators acting on open singlet states only as a quotient
algebra of it. we will call this the open string algebra, and identify some
subalgebras of it. the lie algebra of operators acting on closed singlet states
only will be considered in the next section.

since every element of the grand string algebra maps a state in to to a
state in to, and a state in tc to a state in tc, to and tc furnish two rep-
resentation spaces to the algebra. the representations of the operators in

53

the algebra, of course, form a lie algebra for each of these two representa-
tion spaces. however, since none of these two representation spaces provide
faithful representations to the grand string algebra, some operators vanish.
consider the lie algebra generated by the representation to rst. we are
going to call this algebra the open string algebra. since all operators of the
fth kind sends any state in to to zero, there are only 4 kinds of operators
in this algebra. the lie brackets of these operators are the same as those in
the previous section, except that we set all f i
j s to be zero, i.e., only eq.(103)
needs to be modied. let us write  as  in this open string algebra. note
that the operators in this algebra are not linearly independent; there are
many relations among them. for example,

there are many subalgebras and ideals in the open string algebra. they

were described in table 3 in ref.[20].

4.4 closed string algebra

let us turn our attention to the lie algebra of operators acting on closed
singlet states only. it is generated by the representation space tc. we will
call this the closed string algebra or the cyclix algebra c. since acting any
operator of the rst three kinds on tc yields zero, this lie algebra is obtained
by considering the lie bracket among operators of the fourth and fth kinds
only. thus the closed string algebra is characterized by eqs.(101), (102) and
(103). we will write  as g in the closed string algebra. again the operators
are not linearly independent; in fact, any operator of the fth kind can be

54

written as a linear combination of operators of the fourth kind as

or

can generate many other relations. from eq.(102), we see that the set of
all f i
 for the cyclix algebra. we conjecture that
c is precisely the quotient of the lie algebra given by eqs.(101), (102) and
(103) by the kernel of eqs.(105) and (106). we showed in ref.[21] that this
conjecture is true for  = 1. shown in the same reference was the fact
1 and m 
that if  = 1, then the quotient of the closed string algebra by f 
1,
viewed as another proper ideal of the closed string algebra, yields the witt
algebra. this fact should be much more transparent in the unied account
of both the open string algebra and the closed string algebra in this article:
set  = f = 1 in the grand string algebra, then quotient out m1 (which is
spanned by all operators of the rst three kinds and some linear combinations
of operators of the fourth kind shown in eq.(129) with the primes removed)
and f 
1 (which is spanned by all operators of the fth kind and some linear
combinations of operators of the fourth kind shown in eqs.(105) and (106)),
and we will get the witt algebra. the two apparently dierent ways of
obtaining the witt algebra in refs.[20] and [21] are just dierent orders of
quotienting out the same set of operators.

a cartan subalgebra and the associated root vectors of the  = 1 closed

string algebra is discussed in ref.[21].

4.5 the ising model revisited

in this and the last section, we have mostly been studying issues in mathe-
matics. let us see how to use these mathematical results in physics. a good
starting point should be a model which is simple enough that we know a
great deal of it so that we can see how the algebraic point of view we have
been discussing t in.
in section 2.4, we introduced a number of exactly
solvable matrix models. the ising model is the simplest, and let us look into
this model to see what can be learnt.

there are many dierent ways of solving the ising model. one which is
closer to the original spirit of onsagers approach is via the so-called onsager
algebra [37, 53]. consider a system whose hamiltonian has the form

h = h0 + v

(109)

with the two terms in the hamiltonian satisfying the dolangrady conditions
[54, 55]:

and

[h0, [h0, [h0, v ]]] = 16[h0, v ],

[v, [v, [v, h0]]] = 16[v, h0].

(110)

(111)

then we can construct operators satisfying an innite-dimensional lie alge-
bra

[am, an] = 4gmn, [gm, an] = 2an+m  2anm, and [gm, gn] = 0 (112)

by the following recursion relations:

a0 = h0, a1 = v, an+1  an1 = 1

2[g1, an],

g1 = 1

4 [a1, a0], and gn = 1

4[an, a0].

(113)

this lie algebra is called the onsager lie algebra. it is known to be iso-
morphic to a xed-point subalgebra of the sl(2) loop algebra l(sl(2)) with
respect to the action of a certain involution [56]. we can now use the onsager
algebra to generate an innite number of conserved quantities [57]:

qm = 

1
2

(am + am + am+1 + am+1) .

(114)

56

thus any such system should be integrable.

in the case of the ising model we choose h0 and v as above. the lie
brackets of the cyclix algebra then allows us to verify the dolangrady con-
ditions. thus we can construct the onsager algebra as a proper subalgebra
of c. because of the relationship between the onsager algebra and the loop
algebras, this suggests a deep relationship between c and the loop algebras.
certainly, if we understand some other features of the algebras we have
described in this article better, we will be in a better position to under-
stand yangmills theory, the low energy behavior of string theory, and many
integrable systems.

appendix

a actions of operators on physical states in

the large-n limit

we are going to illustrate (though not rigorously prove) why in the planar
large-n limit, an operator representing a term in a dynamical variable sends
singlet states to singlet states. we are going to conne ourselves to the action
of operators of the second kind dened in section 2.1 only. the reasoning is
similar for operators of other kinds.

assume that the operator is of the form eq.(10) and the open singlet
state is of the form eq.(4). let a = #( i), b = #( j ) and c = #( k). so there
are a creation operators and b annihilation operators for adjoint partons in
the operator of the second kind, and c creation operators for adjoint partons
in the open singlet state. there is a factor of n ( a+b)/2 in the operator of the
second kind and a factor of n ( c+1)/2 in the open singlet state, so initially
there is a total factor of n ( a+b+ c+1)/2. a term in the nal state is either
an open singlet state or a product of an open singlet state and a number of

57

closed singlet states. no matter how many closed singlet states there are in
this term, n should be raised to the power of ( a b + c + 1)/2 in order that
the term survives the large-n limit. it is therefore that only the operations
which produce a factor of n b survive the large-n limit.

to clarify the argument, we need to rene the diagrammatic representa-
tions of an operator of any kind and a singlet state more carefully. note that
in figs. 1(a) and (c), each square carries one color index whereas each circle
carries two color indices. we can put these indices at the ends of the thick
or thin lines attaching to them, as is shown in figs. 19(a) and (b).

figure 19: (a) a typical open singlet state given by eq.(4). the color indices
are explicitly shown. note that each square carries 1 color index, whereas each
circle carries 2 color indices. moreover, the color indices at the two ends of a
connecting solid line are the same. (b) an operator of the second kind given
by eq.(10). only the color indices of the annihilation operators are shown.
(c) the action of an operator of the second kind with no annihilation operator
of an adjoint parton on an open singlet state. to get a non-vanishing nal
state, we need 2 = 1. the creation and annihilation operators removed in
the nal state are depicted as dotted squares or dotted circles. algebraically
the dotted line joining the operator of the second kind and the open singlet
state is 1

a+1. clearly the nal state is an open singlet state.

consider the case when there are no annihilation operators for adjoint
partons in the operator of the second kind, i.e., b = 0. fig. 19(c) shows
the action of such an operator on an open singlet state.
it destroys the
solid square in fig. 19(a) and the hollow square in fig. 19(b). the ends

58

of the lines originally attached to the squares are now joined together by
a dotted line with an appearance dierent from other dotted lines in the
diagrams. algebraically this dotted line is a kronecker delta function. the
factor involving n in the nal state is n ( a+ c+1)/2. this is precisely the factor
for an open singlet state with a + c partons in the adjoint representation.

figure 20: the action of an operator of the second kind on an open singlet
state. (a) the annihilation operator of an adjoint parton in the operator of
the second kind contracts with the rst creation operator of an adjoint parton
in the sequence of adjoint partons in the initial open singlet state. the nal
state is also an open singlet state. this action survives the large-n limit.
(b) here this annihilation operator contracts with the creation operator of a
later adjoint parton in the sequence. the nal state is a product of an open
singlet and a closed singlet. however, this term is negligable in the large-n
limit.

now consider the case when there is one annihilation operator of an ad-
joint parton in the operator of the second kind, i.e., b = 1. the action of this
operator needs to produce a factor of n in order for the nal state to survive
in the large-n limit. consider the following two cases illustrated separately
in figs. 20(a) and (b). in the former diagram, the annihilation operator of an
adjoint parton in the operator of the second kind contracts with the creation
operator of the rst adjoint parton in the initial open singlet state. this
results in a close loop with no squares or circles but two dotted lines only.
algebraically this loop is the factor 1
1, which in turn is equal to n. the
remaining parts of this diagram form an open singlet state. thus the singlet

1 1

59

state survives the large-n limit. in the latter diagram, the annihilation op-
erator of the adjoint parton in the operator of the second kind contracts with
the creation operator of a later adjoint parton in the adjoint parton sequence
of the initial open singlet state. this time the nal state is a product of an
open singlet together with a closed singlet. however, there is no closed loop
with solid and dotted lines only. this implies that no extra factor of n is
produced and so this term can be neglected in the large-n limit.

figure 21: (a) contraction of circles. see the text for details.
(b) the
surviving term in the large-n limit of the action of an operator of the second
kind with b annihilation operators of adjoint partons on an open singlet state.
the nal state is also an open singlet state.

let us now turn to the case when b is an arbitrary positive integer. the
annihilation operator of a conjugate parton in the operator of the second
kind will contract with the creation operator of a conjugate parton in the
initial open singlet state. this will produce 1 dotted line. the b annihilation
operators of adjoint partons in the operator of the second kind will contract
with b creation operators of adjoint partons in the initial meson state. this

60

will further produce 2b dotted lines. hence there are 2b + 1 dotted lines. one
of these dotted lines has to be recruited to join the creation and annihilation
operators in the nal state. in order for the nal state to survive in the large-
n limit, we need a factor of n b, as explained above. since the minimum
number of dotted lines to produce a closed loop without squares or circles
is 2, the factor n b can be obtained only if there are b closed loops, every
closed loop has 2 dotted lines only, and there are no circles or squares in
any closed loop. this can be done only if the 2 dotted lines join 2 adjacent
pairs of creation and annihilation operators. moreover, only 1 dotted line can
be uninvolved in any closed loops. consider fig 21(a), where we contract 2
circles h1 and s1, producing 2 dotted lines l1 and l2. since one of these dotted
lines has to be lie within a closed loop, a pair of circles adjacent to h1 and
s1 has to be contracted. in fig 21(a), h2 and s2 are contracted and hence
we obtain l3 and l4. then either l1 or l4 (or both) has to lie within a closed
loop. if we continue this argument, we will obtain fig. 21(b). as is clear
from the gure, the nal state is an open singlet state. thus we conclude
that in the large-n limit, an operator of the second kind propagates open
singlet states to open singlet states. the actions of operators of other kinds
can be understood similarly.

b associativity of the algebra for the oper-

ators of the second kind

lowing identity:

c cartan subalgebra of l

this can be seen by the following argument. let us call the subspace spanned
by all the l i
j ] = 0 for any integer sequences i and
j. thus m is an abelian subalgebra. in particular, m is niltpotent. to
proceed on, we need the following two lemmas:

i s m. from eq.(53), [l i

i , l j

lemma 1 let

n

i , l k
[l i

l ] =

mk and nk are positive integer sequences
are non-zero numerical coecients.

where n is a nite positive integer,
such that l
then

nk 6= l

mk
nk

nk
mk

for k 6= k, and 
#( mk)  #( nk) = #( k)  #( l)

for every k = 1, 2, . . . , n.

this lemma can be proved by using eq.(53) with j = i.

lemma 2 with the same assumptions as in the previous lemma, we have

#( mk) + #( nk)  #( k) + #( l)

for every k = 1, 2, . . . , n.

this lemma can also be proved by using eq.(53) with j = i. let m be a
positive integer. now we are ready to show for arbitrary non-zero complex
, where i = 1, 2, . . . , m and arbitrary integer sequences lis and
numbers

for i 6= i, and ki 6= li for at least one i, that there

2. #( kj) + #( lj)  #( ki) + #( li) for any i = 1, 2, . . . or m such that

#( kj)  #( lj) = #( ki)  #( li).

if #( kj)  #( lj), then consider

#( kj) and #( nik) = #( lj). by lemmas 1 and 2, we get #( ki) = #( kj)
and #( li) = #( lj). however, we also know that ki 6= kj or li 6= lj and
so there is no k  {1, 2, . . . , ni} such that eq.(117) holds. this leads to a
contradiction and so we conclude that

(116), we deduce that [l
#( kj)  #( lj), then [l
] does not belong to m. hence, the
normalizer of m is m itself. we therefore conclude that m is a cartan
subalgebra of the algebra l. q.e.d.

d root vectors of l

all we need to do is to show that any root vector has to be of the form given
q, where only a nite number of the numerical
p 6= 0, be a root vector. in addition, we can assume without

p = 0. we can deduce from eq.(11) that

can easily convince himself or herself that such an a s

we are going to show that the commutator between two operators of the

showing that eq.(73) satises eq.(72). this involves a tedious compuatation
involving a delta function dened in appendix a of ref.[20]. the properties
of this delta function will be extensively used. let us consider the action
of the commutator of two s on s p . if
p is empty, then eq.(73) certainly
satises eq.(72). therefore we only need to consider the case when p is not

(127)

where m is a root. as a result, we can combine eqs.(126) and (127) together
to obtain an equation which is too long to be written down here for any
integer sequences i, k and m.

let us nd an as

r in f such that r 6= s, as

r2 = 0 for all
r1s, s1s, r2s and s2s such that r1r2 = r and s1s2 = s, and as2
r2 = 0 for
all r2s and s2s such that r1r2r3 = r and s1s2s3 = s for some r1, r3,
s1 and s3. the reader can easily convince himself or herself that such an as
r
always exists. let us choose i = r and k = s in eq.(126). then when we
combine eqs.(126) and (127), we get

r 6= 0, as1

r1 = as2

m = r

therefore, we obtain after some manipulation that

this means

hf r

6= 0; and
6= 0.

since f is a proper ideal, so f  f. now eq.(82) shows clearly that
f = f r
s . the same equation also shows that each root vector space must be
one-dimensional. q.e.d.

g product of two color-invariant operators

we will show by contradiction that the product of two color-invariant op-
erators is in general not well dened. consider the case when  = 1, and

71

assume that the operators 
11...1 and
f (a)
(b) = f 11...1
11...1 , where the number 1 shows up a times in the superscript and
b times in the subscript of . moreover, let (c) = (11...1) and sc = s11...1,
where the number 1 shows up c times.

 (1) are bosonic. let a

b = 11...1

2, . . . , and s are non-zero complex numbers for some positive integers r

thus we assume instead that 1

(q) (sr+1) = (r2 + 2r  1)sr+1, leading to a contradiction8.

1 = 1

this proof can be easily generalized to include fermions and to the case

h grand string algebra

we would like to show that the binary operations given in section 4.2 are
lie superbrackets. thus they constitute a lie superalgebra.

dene the following operators:

+2f

j  i

j  i

j 

ij  f i
ii
j ;

jj  f i
ij

j ; and

lij

+2f

xi=1
xj=1
xj=1

+2f

8this proves our assertion at the beginning of section 3.2, namely that the product
of two operatros of the fourth kind cannot be written as a nite linear combination of
operators of this kind

the reader can verify that

consider the subspace of the singlet states spanned by all states of the

form

1  s k  2  s1+, k,2++f and k  k,

(132)
where any integer in k and k is between 1 and  inclusive, and 1  1, 2 
f . (the justication of the use of the direct products  will be obvious
shortly.) eq.(87) tells us that this denition of k satises eq.(6):

k = k2k1.

(133)

next, consider a subset of color-invariant operators in the heterix algebra
consisting of all nite linear combinations of
j  i
i
j ;
f i
j  f i
j ;
j  l1+, i
2  l i

; and

(134)

73

i or

j is between 1 and  inclusive, and 1 
where any integer in i, j,
1, 2, 3 and 4  f . (again it will be obvious shortly why the direct
products are appropriate.) it can be shown that this subset of color-invariant
operators form a subalgebra of the heterix algebra. a fortiori, this subset
forms a lie algebra. moreover, the subspace of the states dened above is a
representation space for this lie algebra, albeit a reducible one according to
eq.(104).
