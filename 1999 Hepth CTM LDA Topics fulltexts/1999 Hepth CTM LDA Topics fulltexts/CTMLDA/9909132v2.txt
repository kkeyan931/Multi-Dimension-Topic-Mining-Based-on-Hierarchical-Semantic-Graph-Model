abstract

we consider the constraints on the eective lagrangian of the rank-one gauge eld on d-

branes imposed by the equivalence between the description by ordinary gauge theory and

that by non-commutative gauge theory in the presence of a constant b eld. it is shown

that we can consistently construct the two-derivative corrections to the dirac-born-infeld

lagrangian up to the quartic order of eld strength and the most general form which

satises the constraints up to this order is derived.

introduction

there are two dierent descriptions of the eective lagrangian of the gauge elds on

d-branes in at space, with metric gij, in the presence of a constant neveu-schwarz

neveu-schwarz two-form gauge eld (b eld) bij. the rst one is the conventional one in

terms of ordinary gauge elds with ordinary gauge invariance. the gauge transformation

and eld strength are familiar, which are for rank-one gauge theory,

ai = i,

fij = iaj  jai,

fij = 0.

(1.1)

in this formulation, the b-dependence of the eective lagrangian l is only in the combi-
nation b + f .

the other one is in terms of non-commutative gauge elds [1] where the algebra of

functions is deformed to a non-commutative, associative one dened by

f (x)  g(x) = exp   i

ij 
i



 j! f (x + )g(x + )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)==0

= f g +

ijif jg + o(2),

i

(1.2)

(1.3)

with

ij = (2)2

g + 2b

b

,

and the gauge transformation and eld strength for rank-one gauge theory are correspond-

ingly deformed to

 + i  ai  i ai  ,


ai = i
fij = i aj  j ai  i ai  aj + i aj  ai,
fij = i  fij  i fij  .



(1.4)

the eective lagrangian l( f ) in the latter formulation takes the same form as the one
l(f ) in the former [2] except that the product of functions is replaced with the  product

2

(1.2) and that lorentz indices are contracted by the metric gij which is dierent from

the metric gij used in the description in terms of ordinary gauge theory:

gij = gij  (2)2(bg1b)ij,
g  2b!ij

(g1)ij =  

1

g + 2b

g

1

.

(1.5)

(1.6)

the b-dependence in the latter formulation is encoded in , g and the coupling constant.

the equivalence of the two descriptions is recently discussed in detail [2] which is real-
ized by the transformation between the non-commutative gauge eld a and the ordinary

one a,

a(a) + 

a(a) = a(a + a),

(1.7)

with innitesimal  and (, a). the two lagrangians in terms of a and a should be

related as

l(b + f ) = l( f ) + total derivative,

(1.8)

under the transformation (1.7). this was veried in [2] for the dirac-born-infeld (dbi)
lagrangian in the approximation that eld strength is slowly varying. we should note
here that the relation between a and a (1.7) is determined independently of the form of

the eective lagrangian and thus the condition (1.8) imposes constraints on the form of

the lagrangian as is argued in [2] that the dbi lagrangian is the only lagrangian which

satises (1.8) in the approximation that eld strength is slowly varying.

the applicability of the argument that the two formulations are equivalent and the

condition (1.8) should be satised is, however, more general and not restricted to such

cases. it would be a non-trivial question whether the condition (1.8) can indeed be satised

when we include derivative corrections to the dbi lagrangian. if we assume that it is

possible, the next question to be raised is to what extent the lagrangian is constrained

by the condition (1.8). in the present paper, we consider the questions for two-derivative

corrections to the dbi lagrangian up to the quartic order of eld strength in rank-one

gauge theory. we derive the most general structure which satises the condition (1.8) up

to this order.

 for a recent review of the dirac-born-infeld theory see [3] and references therein.

the organization of this paper is as follows. in section 2, we rst consider how f 4

terms are determined by the requirement (1.8) to illustrate our method for this simplest

case. we then extend our discussions to two-derivative corrections in section 3. section

4 is devoted to conclusions and discussions.

2. determination of f 4 terms

it is already argued in [2] that the dbi lagrangian satises the condition (1.8) in the

approximation that eld strength is slowly varying as we mentioned in section 1 and

most of the calculations in the present section are nothing but the reorganization of those

in [2]. however, in addition to the purpose of the illustration of our method which will

be applied to the determination of derivative corrections in the next section, it would

be instructive to see how f 4 terms are determined from the information on the f 2 term

alone without the information on the whole form of the lagrangian in order to extend

our consideration to derivative corrections of which we do not know the whole structure.

let us begin with some preparations. the equation (1.7) is solved in the expansion

with respect to  [2]. for rank-one gauge theory, it is given by

klak(lai + fli) + o(2),

1
ai = ai 
2
1
 =  +
klkal + o(2).
2

for the eld strength, it follows from the solution for a that

fij = fij  kl(fikflj + aklfij) + o(2).

we need to expand g1, , the  product (1.2) and fij with respect to :

(g1)ij = (g1)ij + (2)2(g1bg1bg1)ij + o(4),

ij = (2)2(g1bg1)ij + o(4),

i
2

f  g = f g 
fij = fij + (2)2(g1bg1)kl(fikflj + aklfij) + o(4).

(2)2(g1bg1)klkf lg + o(4),

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

 it was pointed out in [4] that there are ambiguities in perturbative solutions to the equation (1.7)
which are related to gauge transformation and to eld redenition. however, it is easily veried that
our results will not be modied essentially by the presence of such ambiguities up to the order we are
discussing.

4

the discussions presented in this paper do not depend on the dimension of space-time on

which the gauge theory is dened, namely, the dimension of world-volume of the d-brane.
we only need to multiply an appropriate power of  to the lagrangian to make the action

dimensionless.

let us rst verify that the f 2 term

l(f ) = tr(g1f g1f ) + o(2)  (g1)ijfjk(g1)klfli + o(2),

(2.8)

satises the condition (1.8). the left-hand side of (1.8) is

l(b + f ) = tr(g1(b + f )g1(b + f )) + o(2)

= tr(g1b)2 + 2tr(g1bg1f ) + tr(g1f )2 + o(2)

= tr(g1f )2 + constant + total derivative + o(2).

(2.9)

the non-commutative counterpart, the right-hand side of (1.8), is

l( f ) = tr(g1 f  g1 f ) + o(2) = tr(g1f g1f ) + o(2).

(2.10)

thus (1.8) is satised for (2.8). this may seem trivial but is important: the f 2 term
(2.8) is qualied as an initial term of a consistent lagrangian in the  expansion. let us

dene the initial term condition as follows: if f (f ) satises

f (b + f ) = f (f ) + total derivative,

(2.11)

we say that f (f ) satises the initial term condition. in this terminology, tr(g1f g1f )

satises the initial term condition.

now we go on to the order o(2). the non-commutative side tr(g1 f  g1 f ) is

evaluated as follows:

tr(g1 f  g1 f ) = tr(g1 f g1 f ) + o(4)

= tr(g1 f )2 + 2(2)2tr(g1b)2(g1f )2 + o(4)

= tr(g1f )2

+2(2)2trg1b(g1f )3 
+2(2)2tr(g1b)2(g1f )2 + total derivative + o(4). (2.12)

(2)2tr(g1bg1f )tr(g1f )2

the existence of o(bf 3) terms and o(b2f 2) terms in (2.12) implies that the correspond-

ing terms must exist on the commutative side as well. the sources for such terms are
tr(g1(b + f ))4 and (tr(g1(b + f ))2)2 which are expanded as follows:

tr(g1(b + f ))4 = tr(g1f )4 + 4trg1b(g1f )3

+4tr(g1b)2(g1f )2 + 2tr(g1bg1f )2

+ constant + total derivative,

(2.13)

(tr(g1(b + f ))2)2 = (tr(g1f )2)2 + 4tr(g1bg1f )tr(g1f )2

+2tr(g1b)2tr(g1f )2 + 4(tr(g1bg1f ))2

+ constant + total derivative.

(2.14)

by comparing the o(bf 3) terms in (2.12) with those in (2.13) and (2.14), we can uniquely
determine the structure at o(2) as

1
2

(2)2tr(g1(b + f ))4 

1
8

(2)2(tr(g1(b + f ))2)2.

(2.15)

now the comparison of the o(b2f 2) terms provides a consistency condition. there are

three missing terms in (2.12) in comparison with (2.15). the two of them are combined

into total derivative:

(2)2(cid:20)tr(g1bg1f )2 

1
2

(tr(g1bg1f ))2(cid:21) = total derivative.

the last one

(2)2tr(g1b)2tr(g1f )2

(2.16)

(2.17)

can be taken care of by the b-dependence of the coupling constant. the lagrangian l(f )
in terms of the ordinary gauge theory should be multiplied by det g/gs where gs is the
string coupling constant and we write the corresponding factor on the non-commutative
side as det g/gs. the new coupling constant gs can depend on b. the b-dependence
in our point of view, we
of gs was determined in [2] by using the dbi lagrangian.

cannot use the dbi lagrangian: we are now determining its form.

it is determined

perturbatively by the presence of the term (2.17) as follows:

det g

gs

det g

gs

=

(cid:20)1

4

(2)2tr(g1b)2 + o(4)(cid:21) .

(2.18)

6

this completes the consistency check of the o(b2f 2) terms.

the presence of the structure (2.15) in turn requires the existence of the corresponding

structure on the non-commutative side, which is

1
2

(2)2tr(g1 f )4

arbitrary 

1
8

(2)2(tr(g1 f )2)2

arbitrary,

(2.19)

where the subscripts arbitrary imply that the ordering of the four eld strengths in

each term is arbitrary. since the product in the non-commutative gauge theory is the
non-commutative  product, we have to specify the ordering of eld strengths as in the
case of f 4 terms in the yang-mills theory. however, the non-commutativity becomes
relevant only at higher orders in the  expansion:

(2)2tr(g1 f )4

arbitrary 

1

(2)2(tr(g1 f )2)2

arbitrary

1
2

=

1
2

(2)2tr(g1 f )4 

1
8

(2)2(tr(g1 f )2)2 + o(4),

(2.20)

where the product in the second line is ordinary one, so the ordering problem does not

matter at the order we are discussing. inversely, the consideration at the present order

alone cannot constrain the ordering. it would be interesting to see if the discussion at

higher orders can determine or constrain the ordering.

to summarize, we have seen that the lagrangian

l(b + f ) =

det g

gs

(cid:20)tr(g1(b + f ))2 +

(2)2tr(g1(b + f ))4

(2.21)


and its non-commutative counterpart

l( f ) =

arbitrary + o(4)(cid:21) ,

(2.22)

coincide up to total derivative under the denition of gs (2.18), namely, the condition

(1.8) is satised. thus we uniquely determined the f 4 terms as

det g

l(f ) =

gs

(2)2(tr(g1f )2)2 + o(4)(cid:21) ,

(2.23)

from the requirement (1.8) alone. the resulting lagrangian coincides with the  expan-

sion of the dbi lagrangian if it is multiplied by

(2)2

4(2)p() p+1

2



(2.24)

when the dimension of the space-time is p + 1.

we would like to make a comment here. from the fact that we have determined the

f 4 terms uniquely from the f 2 term it follows that it is impossible to organize the f 4

terms so as to satisfy (1.8) without the f 2 term. in other words, no f 4 structure can

satisfy the initial term condition dened in (2.11). we can show this explicitly by writing

the most general f 4 terms and seeing if they satisfy (2.11). it is not dicult to see that

the o(b2f 2) terms on the left-hand side cannot be arranged to total derivative.

3. determination of two-derivative corrections

since we have explained our strategy in detail in section 2, it would not be dicult to

apply it to the two-derivative corrections to the dbi lagrangian. in the rst part of this

section, we construct one of consistent lagrangians with two derivatives up to the quartic

order of eld strength. we then derive the most general form of the lagrangian up to

this order in the second part.

3.1 construction of a consistent lagrangian

the two-derivative corrections to the dbi lagrangian can rst appear at order o()

compared with the f 2 term. using the integration by parts and the bianchi identity, any
term of order o() can be transformed to the following form up to an overall constant:

l(f ) = (g1)nm(g1)ijnfjk(g1)klmfli.

(3.1)

it is possible to absorb this term into the f 2 term (2.8) by eld redenition. however,

we do not know in which denition of the gauge eld the transformation (2.1) is valid

in general so we should not make such redenition in determining the possible form of

 we absorbed an appropriate power of  into the overall constant as well to simplify the following

expressions.

8

the lagrangian. it is easily seen that (3.1) satises the initial term condition (2.11) since

i(b + f )jk = ifjk for a constant b.

to construct the non-commutative counterpart l( f ) of this lagrangian, we have to

replace the derivatives in (3.1) with covariant derivatives dened by

di fjk = i fjk  i ai  fjk + i fjk  ai,

(3.2)

since non-commutative gauge elds are non-commutative even when the rank is one. now

the non-commutative lagrangian becomes

l( f ) = (g1)nm(g1)ij dn fjk  (g1)kl dm fli.

since the gauge transformation of di fjk is

( di fjk) = i  di fjk  i di fjk  ,

the action made from (3.3) is gauge invariant.

(3.3)

(3.4)

now let us evaluate (3.3) in the  expansion. the covariant derivative of eld strength

dn fij is expanded as

dn fij = nfij

+(2)2(g1bg1)kl(n(fikflj) + fnklfij + aknlfij) + o(4). (3.5)

using this result, (3.3) is evaluated as follows:
(g1)nm(g1)ij dn fjk  (g1)kl dm fli

= (g1)nm(g1)ij dn fjk(g1)kl dm fli + o(4)
= (g1)nm(g1)ij dn fjk(g1)kl dm fli

+(2)2h(g1bg1bg1)nm(g1)ijnfjk(g1)klmfli
+2(g1)nm(g1bg1bg1)ijnfjk(g1)klmflii + o(4)

= (g1)nm(g1)ijnfjk(g1)klmfli

+(2)2h2(g1)nm(g1)ijnfjk(g1)kl(g1bg1)pq(m(flpfqi) + fmpqfli)

+(g1bg1bg1)nm(g1)ijnfjk(g1)klmfli

tr(g1bg1f )(g1)nm(g1)ij(g1)klnfjkmfli

1
2

+2(g1)nm(g1bg1bg1)ijnfjk(g1)klmflii

+ total derivative + o(4).

(3.6)

9

lorentz indices in most of the expressions in what follows are contracted with respect to
the metric gij so that we simplify the expressions by making g1 implicit as

aibi  (g1)ijaibj,

2  (g1)ijij,

(3.7)

unless the other metric gij is explicitly used. with this convention, (3.6) is expressed as

(g1)nm(g1)ij dn fjk  (g1)kl dm fli

= nfijnfji

+(2)2 [2nfijnfjk(bklfli + fklbli) + 2nfijfnkbkllfji

1
2

bklflknfijnfji + bnkbklnfijlfji + 2nfijnfjkbklbli(cid:21)


+o(4) + total derivative.

(3.8)

we can easily guess the o(2) terms which we have to add to (3.1) to satisfy the condition

(1.8) from the o(b2f 3) part of (3.8). by replacing b in the o(b2f 3) part of (3.8)

with f and taking into account the symmetry factors, we have the following lagrangian:

l(f ) =

det g

gs

hnfijnfji + 2(2)2nfijnfjkfklfli

1
4

+(2)2fnkfklnfijlfji 

(2)2fklflknfijnfji + o(4)(cid:21) . (3.9)
by expanding l(b + f ), we can see that it generates the o(b2f 3) terms in (3.8). the
consistency check of o(b22f 2) part can be done just as in the case of section 2. there
is one missing term in (3.8) compared with the o(b22f 2) part of l(b + f ). precisely
the same denition of the coupling constant gs in the non-commutative gauge theory as

(2.18) produces the missing term. there is again the ordering ambiguity in the o(2f 4)
terms on the non-commutative side l( f ) but it does not matter at the order we are
considering just as in the preceding section.

thus we have succeeded in constructing a lagrangian (3.9) with two derivatives up to

the quartic order of eld strength which satises the condition (1.8) under the denition

of gs (2.18). however, the lagrangian (3.9) may not be the unique one which satis-

es the requirement (1.8). let us reconsider the procedure by which we obtained (3.9),

namely, replacing b in the o(b2f 3) part of (3.8) with f . the resulting lagrangian can

10

surely produce o(b2f 3) part of (3.8) as we have seen. however, it may not the unique

possibility. take the second term

2nfijnfjk(bklfli + fklbli)

(3.10)

on the right-hand side of (3.8) as an example. the term nfijnfjkfklfli generates (3.10)

when we replace f with b + f but nfijn(fjkfklfli) also generates (3.10) with extra

unwanted terms. there are possibilities that such extra terms can be arranged to total

derivative so as to satisfy (1.8). we will consider such possibilities in the next subsection.

at any rate, the fact that we found a consistent form of two-derivative corrections
(3.9) at least at the current order in the  expansion is non-trivial and interesting itself.

it remains to be investigated whether it persists to higher orders.

3.2 solutions to the initial term condition

let us go back to the problem whether or not the lagrangian (3.9) is the unique one
which satises (1.8). assume that there is another lagrangian l(f ) satisfying (1.8)
which coincides with l(f ) (3.9) at o(2f 2) but diers at o(2f 4). then the dierence
l(f )l(f ) also satises the condition (1.8) but it does not have o(2f 2) part. therefore
the o(2f 4) part of it must satisfy the initial term condition (2.11). now the problem of

uniqueness reduced to the question whether there are solutions of the form o(2f 4) to

the initial term condition.

what we should do is now clear. first write the most general terms of order o(2f 4)

and replace f with b +f . the resulting terms are quadratic with respect to b so that we

should look for combinations of terms such that the o(b) and o(b2) parts are arranged

to total derivatives respectively.

any term of order o(2f 4) can be transformed to the following form using the inte-

gration by parts and the bianchi identity [5]:

l =

7

xi=1

biji,

(3.11)

where

j1 = nfijnfjifklflk,

j2 = nfijnfjkfklfli,

11

j3 = fnifimnfklmflk,

j4 = nfnimfimfklflk,

j5 = nfnimfijfjkfkm,
j7 = 2fijfjkfklfli,

j6 = 2fijfjifklflk,
2fij = ikfkj  jkfki.

(3.12)

we will call this basis {ji} as the andreev-tseytlin basis. this basis is useful when we
consider eld redenition because the rst three coecients b1, b2 and b3 in this basis do

not change under eld redenition and unambiguous [6]. however, the following basis

will turn out to be more convenient for the problem at hand:

l =

5

xi=1

aiji + a6j 

6 + a7j 
7,

where

j 
6 = fijnfjifklnflk,

j 
7 = fijnfjkfklnfli.

the two bases are related as follows:

1
2

1
j 
j1 
6 = 
2
j6 = j1  2j 
6,

j6,

j 
7 = 2j2  j7,
j7 = 2j2  j 
7.

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

let us denote the o(bn) part of ji with its f replaced by b + f as ji(bn) (and similarly
for j 

i).
first consider the o(b2) part. explicit expressions for ji(b2) and j 

i(b2), and their

variations with respect to ai are

j1(b2) = nfijnfjibklblk,

j1(b2) = 4bklblkai2jfij,

j2(b2) = nfijnfjkbklbli,
j2(b2) = 2bkmbmlai2lfik  2bimbmjai2kfkj,
j3(b2) = bnibimnfklmflk,

j3(b2) = 4bkmbmlaikjlfij,

j4(b2) = nfnimfimbklblk,
j5(b2) = nfnimfijbjkbkm,
j 
j 
6(b2) = bijnfjibklnflk,
j 
7(b2) = bijnfjkbklnfli,

j 

12

j4(b2) = 2bklblkai2jfij,

j5(b2) = 2bkmbmlaijklfji,

6(b2) = 4bijbklai2jflk,

7(b2) = 4bijbklai2lfjk,

(3.16)

where total derivatives are neglected. we can see the four dierent structures bklblkai,
bimbmjai, bkmbmlai and bijbklai in ji(b2) and j 
i(b2). they must vanish re-
spectively for a combination of ji(b2) and j 
i(b2) to be total derivative. solving this
condition, we found that the most general combinations of ji(b2) and j 
i(b2) which are

total derivatives are

6  2j 
7).
this is a necessary condition for the initial term condition (2.11).

l = a1(j1  2j4) + a3(j3 + 2j5) + a6(j 

(3.17)

it follows that the

number of independent solutions to the initial term condition is three at most.

next consider the o(b) part. ji(b) and j 

i(b) are

j1(b) = 2nfijnfjibklflk,

j4(b) = 2nfnimfimbklflk,

j3(b) = 2bnifimnfklmflk,

j 
6(b) = 2bijnfjifklnflk,

j5(b) = nfnimfijbjkfkm  nfnimfijfjkbkm,
j 
(3.18)
7(b) = 2bijnfjkfklnfli,

where we omitted j2(b) since its appearance in solutions is forbidden by the necessary
condition (3.17). in this case, we can divide ji(b) and j 

i(b) into two parts: terms with
bijai and terms with bklai. both parts must vanish respectively for a combination of
ji(b) and j 

i(b) to be total derivative.

consider the terms with bijai. the relevant combinations in (3.17) are

[j1(b)  2j4(b)] = 8bijaijn(fnlmflm  mfnlflm) + terms with bklai,
[j3(b) + 2j5(b)] = 2bijain(jfklnflk + 2lflknfkj) + terms with bklai,
[j 
7(b)] = 4bijain(jfklnflk  2lflknfkj) + terms with bklai,

6(b)  2j 

(3.19)

where total derivatives are neglected. we found that the only combination where the

 we can show that the bijai part of [j1(b)2j4(b)] is not proportional to that of [j3(b)+2j5(b)]
(or equivalently to that of [j 
7(b)]) as follows. the latter contains the structure bij aiaj
while it is absent from the former. moreover, both of them have the structure ba 3a 2a but the index
j in each term of the former belongs to one of the derivatives in  3a while it is not the case for the latter.

(j

(3.20)

thus we have obtained an additional necessary condition for the initial term condition

(2.11), which is

l = a3(cid:20)(j3 + 2j5) +

(j

(3.21)

now the number of independent solutions reduced to one at most. in order to determine

if the particular combination (3.21) satises the initial term condition (2.11), it remains

to evaluate the bklai part of (3.20) to see if it vanishes. it would be straightforward to

do that but it requires rather tedious calculations. we will take a dierent approach in

the following instead of performing such explicit evaluation.

let us repeat the calculations in the previous subsection with (3.1) replaced by

l(f ) = ifikjfjk,

(3.22)

although this lagrangian is proportional to (3.1) up to total derivative as we mentioned be-
fore. the non-commutative counterpart of this lagrangian (g1)ij(g1)kl(g1)nm di fjn
dk fln is expanded with respect to  as follows:

(g1)ij(g1)kl(g1)nm di fjn  dk flm

= ifikjfjk

bklflkifijnfnj + 2bimbmlifljkfkj + bjmbmnifijkfkn(cid:21)


+o(4) + total derivative.

(3.23)

as we have done in the previous case, it is not dicult to nd the following lagrangian

l(f ) =

det g

gs

hifikjfjk + 2(2)2fimfmlifljkfkj

+(2)2fjmfmnifijkfkn

4

(2)2fklflkifijnfnj + o(4)(cid:21) ,

(3.24)

which generates the o(b2f 3) and o(b22f 2) parts of (3.23) under the denition of gs

(2.18). this is another lagrangian which satises the condition (1.8).

the o(2f 4) terms of both lagrangians (3.9) and (3.24) can be expressed in the

andreev-tseytlin basis (3.12) as follows:

det g

gs

l1 =

(cid:20)nfijnfji + (2)2(cid:18)2j2 + j3

(3.27)

since

nfijnfji = 2ifikjfjk + total derivative,

(3.28)

the o(2f 4) part of (2l2)  l1 satises the initial term condition (2.11), which is

(3.29)

this precisely coincides with the combination appeared in the necessary condition (3.21).

thus we have shown that the combination of o(2f 4) terms (3.21) satises the initial

term condition (2.11) and that it is the only solution since we have shown that the number

of independent solutions is one at most.

to summarize, we derived the most general form of the lagrangian with two derivatives

which satises (1.8) up to the quartic order of eld strength. our result is

l(f ) =

that for the lagrangian without derivatives in the previous section so that we can super-

pose the two lagrangians without violating the condition (1.8). the resulting expression

where a, b and c are arbitrary constants. this is the most general form of the lagrangian

which satises the condition (1.8) up to two derivatives and up to the quartic order of
eld strengthk.

4. conclusions and discussions

we considered the constraints on the form of the eective lagrangian of the rank-one

gauge eld on d-branes imposed by the condition that the two descriptions in terms of

the ordinary and non-commutative gauge theories in the presence of a constant b eld

are equivalent and are related by (1.8). we rst explained how the form of f 4 terms is

uniquely determined from the information on the f 2 term alone by the condition (1.8).

we then applied our method to two-derivative terms and derived the most general form

of them up to the quartic order of eld strength. the result is summarized in (3.31).

our result shows that the equivalence of the two descriptions can persist beyond the

approximation that the eld strength is slowly varying at least to the rst non-trivial
order in the  expansion. moreover, we found that the requirement of the equivalence

highly constrains the form of the eective lagrangian. not only the equivalence of the

two descriptions is important conceptually but also it may be useful practically. we hope

that our approach provides a new perspective on the analysis of the dynamics of the gauge

eld on d-branes.

finally, let us compare our result with ones obtained from other methods and discuss

possible future direction of our approach. it would be helpful to discuss how our nal

k we can show that there are no non-vanishing o(f 3) and o( 2f 3) terms in rank-one gauge theory.

result (3.31) behaves under eld redenition in comparing with results in the literature.

as we mentioned before, the coecients in front of the o(2f 2) term, j4, j5, j6 and j7

in the andreev-tseytlin basis change under eld redenition. we can make them vanish

if we redene the gauge eld ai as follows:

a
2c

ai = ai 
+(2)3 

(2)jfji 
a  b
8c

nfinfklfkl

a  2b

2c

nfikfnlflk 

a  b

nfknfilflk! . (4.1)

then the lagrangian (3.31) is rewritten in terms of fij = i aj  j ai as

(2)2det g
l =
gs(2)p() p+1
+(a  b)(2)3(cid:18)
+o(4)i ,

2 (cid:20)c fij fji + c(2)2(cid:18)1

n fijn fji fkl flk + 2n fijn fjk fkl fli + fni fimn fklm flk(cid:19)

(4.2)

where total derivatives are neglected. it can be seen from this expression that the condi-

tion (1.8) determines the coecients which do not change under eld redenition almost

uniquely except some overall constants.

now let us compare (4.2) with results obtained from other methods. the derivative

corrections to the dbi lagrangian were derived from the string four-point amplitude [5]
or from the two-loop -function in the open string  model [6] . the o(2f 4) terms in
the bosonic string case are proportional to

while our result is proportional to

1
4



j1  2j2 + j3

1
4



j1 + 2j2 + j3.

(4.3)

(4.4)

these are very close but dier in a sign. we do not understand the origin of such

discrepancy. for the superstring case, it was found that o(2f 4) terms vanish [5, 8]. this

 very recently, the derivative corrections to the d-brane action were derived from the method of

generalized boundary state for bosonic string theory [7] and for superstring theory [8].

 this expression is slightly dierent from (4) in [6] but the author was informed of a misprint in (4)

of [6]: the last coecient b3 should have sign +.

17

is consistent with our result because our method did not determine the overall factor and

allows it to vanish. it should be claried whether or not the discrepancy is characteristic

of bosonic strings.

in this paper, we have concentrated on rank-one gauge theory. one of possible exten-

sions of our approach is to consider higher-rank gauge theory. in particular, it would be an

interesting question whether our approach can constrain the ordering of non-abelian eld

strengths. the perturbative solution to (1.7) for the higher-rank case is already presented

in [2] and in fact it is not dicult to see that the calculations presented in section 2 can

be extended to the higher-rank case as well at the order we have considered. however,

the discussion at this order could not determine the ordering of eld strengths. it would

deserve to extend our consideration to higher orders to discuss the problem.

another motivation for extension to higher orders is to investigate how terms with

dierent numbers of derivatives are related by the condition (1.8). the constraints on

terms without derivatives presented in section 2 and those on two-derivative corrections

in section 3 are almost independent at the order which we have considered except that

the denitions of gs on both sides must be the same to superpose the two lagrangians.

however, the independence may not persist to higher orders. this problem would be

more important for the higher-rank case where the separation between eld strengths and

covariant derivatives becomes ambiguous.

note added

in proving that the combination (3.21) satises the initial term condition, it was as-

sumed that the non-commutative counterpart of the relation (3.28) holds as well. however,

it turned out that this is not the case since from

dn fij  dn fji = 2 fik  dj di fjk + total derivative,
2 di fik  dj fjk = 2 fik  di dj fjk + total derivative,

it follows that

dn fij  dn fji + 2 di fik  dj fjk

= 2 fik  [ dj, di] fjk + total derivative

18

= 4i fij  fjk  fki + total derivative
= 2(2)2bnmfijnfjkmfki + o(4) + total derivative.

thus the conclusion which we can derive from the fact that the lagrangians l1 and l2
satisfy the condition (1.8) is not that the combination

f (f )  

1
4

j1 + 2j2 + j3 + 2j5 

1
4

j6 + j7

satises the initial term condition but that

f (b + f ) = f (f )  2bnmfijnfjkmfki + total derivative,

so that there is no solution of the form o(2f 4) to the initial term condition.

this does not change our nal result (3.31), however the reason why we can add

the part proportional to b in (3.31) is not that it satises the initial term condition but
that we can add the term 2 fik  [ dj, di] fjk = 4i fij  fjk  fki which vanishes in the
commutative limit when we construct the lagrangian on the non-commutative side. this
ambiguity in constructing l( f ) from l(f ) is characteristic of the rank-one gauge theory
because the f 3 term no longer vanishes for higher-rank cases and if we could succeed in

generalizing the part proportional to b in (3.31) to the higher-rank cases, its existence

would be naturally understood by the fact that the f 3 term satises the initial term

condition.

furthermore, several important developments in our understanding have been made

recently [9].

it has turned out that it is in general possible to constrain the eective

lagrangian without assuming the form of the eld redenition (2.1) and its form is rather

regarded as a consequence of the compatibility of the description by non-commutative

gauge theory with that by ordinary gauge theory. moreover, it has turned out that

gauge-invariant but b-dependent corrections to (2.1) are generally possible and necessary

for some cases including the case of bosonic string theory, which resolves the discrepancy

between (4.3) and (4.4).
