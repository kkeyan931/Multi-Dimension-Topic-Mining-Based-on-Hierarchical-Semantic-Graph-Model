we prove the monopole condensation in qcd by demonstrating that the monopole potential ac-
quires a mass through the quantum correction, which could induce the dual meissner eect and
guarantee the connement of color in the non-abelian guage theory. the proof is made by separat-
ing the topological degrees which describes the non-abelian monopoles from the dynamical degrees
of the potential, and integrating out all the dynamical degrees of qcd.

one of the most outstanding problems in theoretical
physics is the connement problem in qcd. it has long
been argued that the monopole condensation could ex-
plain the connement of color through the dual meissner
eect [1,2].
indeed, if one assumes the monopole con-
densation, one could easily argue that the ensuing dual
meissner eect guarantees the connement [3,4]. but so
far there has not been a satisfactory proof how the de-
sired monopole condensation could take place in qcd.
in this direction, however, there has been a remarkable
progress in the lattice simulation during the last decade.
in fact the recent numerical simulation has provided an
unmistakable evidence which supports the idea of the
magnetic connement through the monopole condensa-
tion [5,6]. the purpose of this letter is to provide a
possible theoretical mechanism of the monopole conden-
sation in qcd. utilizing the parametrization of the qcd
potential which accommodates the topological degrees ex-
plicitly we show that the monopole potential acquires a
mass through the quantum correction, after we integrate
out all the dynamical degrees of the non-abelian poten-
tial. this provides us a natural mechanism for the dy-
namical generation of the mass gap which triggers the
dual meissner eect in qcd.

to prove the magnetic connement in qcd it is im-
portant for us to remember how the magnetic ux is con-
ned in the superconductor through the meissner eect.
in the ginzberg-landau description of superconductivity
the meissner eect is triggered by the mass term for the
electromagnetic potential, which determines the penetra-
tion (connement) scale of the magnetic ux. in the mi-
croscopic bcs description this eective mass, of course,
is generated by the electron-pair (the cooper pair) con-
densation. this suggests that, for the connement of
the color electric ux, one need the condensation of the
monopoles. so the essence of the connement in qcd lies
in the dynamical generation of the eective mass for the
monopole potential. to demonstrate this one must rst
identify the monopole potential, and separate it from the

generic qcd connection, in a gauge independent manner.
for this it is important to understand the mathematical
structure of the non-abelian gauge theory. a charac-
teristic feature of the non-abelian gauge theory is its
rich topological structure manifested by the non-abelian
monopoles, and the -vacuua and the instantons. so it is
crucial to take into account the nontrivial topology when
one discusses the connement. fortunately there exists
a natural reparametrization of connection which acco-
modates the topological degrees explicitly, and allows us
to separate the monopole potential from the generic non-
abelian potential in a gauge independent way [2,3]. with
this separation of the monopole potential one can obtain
the desired magnetic condensation by proving that the
monopole potential acquires a mass after one integrates
out all the dynamical degrees of the non-abelian gauge
potential.

consider su (2) for simplicity. a natural way to
accomodate the topological degrees is to introduce an
isotriplet unit vector eld n which selects an abelian
direction at each space-time point, and to decompose the
connection into the abelian part which leaves n invariant
and the remaining part which forms a covariant vector
eld [2,3],

~a = an 

1
g
= a + ~x,

n   n + ~x

(n2 = 1),

(1)

where a = n  ~a is the electric potential. notice
that the abelian projection a is precisely the connection
which leaves n invariant under the parallel transport,

d n =  n + g a  n = 0.

 a =

(4)

notice that a still describes an su (2) connection which
enjoys the full su (2) gauge degrees of freedom. more
importantly, a retains the full topological characteris-
tics of the original non-abelian potential. clearly the
isolated singularities of n denes 2(s2) which describes
the non-abelian monopoles. indeed a with a = 0 and
n = r describes precisely the wu-yang monopole [7,8].
besides, with the s3 compactication of r3, n character-
izes the hopf invariant 3(s2)  3(s3) which describes
the topologically distinct vacuua [9,10].

the above discussion implies that there exists a sub-
class of the non-abelian gauge theory called the restricted
gauge theory, which contains only the abelian projection
which nevertheless has the full non-abelian gauge de-
grees of freedom [2,3]. to understand this, notice that
with the abelian projection a one has

f = (f + h)n,
f = a   a,

h = 

1
g

n  ( n   n) = c  c,

(5)

this shows that the yang-mills theory can be viewed as
the restricted gauge theory which has an additional gauge
covariant charged vector eld (the valence gluons) as its
source [3].

clearly our parametrization (1) of the potential has
an important advantage to allow us to separate the non-
abelian monopole potential from the generic qcd con-
nection. indeed with

~a = ~b + ~c,

~b = a n + ~x, ~c = 

1
g

n   n,

(10)

one can interpret ~b as the gluon potential which de-
scribes the dynamical degrees, and ~c as the monopole
potential which describes the topological degrees, of the
non-abelian potential. with this separation the proof
of the monopole condensation is reduced to the proof of
the dynamical generation of the eective mass for the
monopole potential ~c.

with these preliminaries we are ready to prove the
monopole condensation in qcd. we will do this by show-
ing that the eective theory of qcd, which one obtains
after integrating out all the dynamical degrees, can be
written as

indeed with n = (sin  cos , sin  sin , cos ), one nds

which describes precisely the diracs monopole potential
around the isolated singularities of n. this tells that the
restricted gauge theory

(7)

describes the dual dynamics of qcd with the dynami-
cal degrees of the abelian subgroup u (1) as the electric
component and the topological degrees of su (2) as the
magnetic component [2,3].

with (1) one has

~f = f + d ~x  d ~x + g ~x  ~x,

notice that the mass term of the monopole potential is
manifest in the eective lagrangian, which is what one
need to trigger the dual meissner eect. as interestingly
this is precisely the skyrme-faddeev lagrangian which
allows the topological knot solitons as the classical solu-
tions [11]. so the monopole condensation could be con-
rmed by the proof of the skyrme-faddeev lagrangian
as an eective lagrangian of qcd. the fact that a gen-
eralized non-linear sigma model of skyrme-faddeev type
could be interpreted as the eective theory of qcd has
been established recently [12]. but in view of the physical
importance of the issue we give an independent deriva-
tion of the eective action of qcd in the following.

consider the generating functional for (9)

w [j, ~j] = z dad ~x exp[iz (
+ aj + ~x  ~j)d4x].

(13)

we have to perform the functional integral with a proper
choice of a gauge, leaving ~c as a background. to do
this we rst x the gauge with the condition

~f = a n + d ~x +  ~c  ~f = 0,

lgf = 

1

2 h(a)2 + ( d ~x +  ~c)2i .

(14)

with (3) the corresponding faddeev-popov determinant
can be written as

m ab =

b =

g

{2ab + (na nb  2nb na)

+ na2 nb  nb2na

(15)

so the generating functional takes the form with  = 1,

with the introduction of an auxiliary antisymmetric ten-
sor eld the quartic interaction of ~x can be reduced to
a quadratic interaction of the antisymmetric tensor eld,
which can easily be integrated out [12]. with this under-
standing the integration over ~x results in the following
functional determinant in one loop approximation,

where , 1, and 2 are the renormalized coupling con-
stants. this completes the derivation of the eective ac-
tion of qcd, which demonstrates that the monopole po-
tential acquires an eective mass after the quantum cor-
rection. obviously the mass scale sets the connement
scale.

notice that, in terms of the topological eld n, the

which is identical to the eective lagrangian of qcd
that we obtained recently [12]. clearly the above analysis
provides an independent conrmation of the fact that a
generalized non-linear sigma model of skyrme-faddeev
type could describe the eective theory of qcd.

there have been two competing proposals for the cor-
rect mechanism of the connement in qcd, the one em-
phasizing the role of the instantons and the other empha-
sizing that of the monopoles. our analysis strongly sup-
ports the monopole condensation as the physical mech-
anism for the connement of color in qcd. more im-
portantly it identies the dynamical symmetry breaking
mechanism of the monopole condensation, and demon-
strates the existence of the mass gap in the infra-red limit
of qcd based on the rst principles.

we conclude with the following remarks:

1) there is one subtlety in our derivation of the monopole
condensation. in the meissner eect the potential which
acquires the mass was the one whose time-component
describes the coulomb interaction. but in our analysis
the potential which acquires the mass was the one whose
space-like components describes the monopoles. to keep
the exact analogy, we may have to introduce the poten-
tial which is dual to our monopole potential, and show
that this dual potential acquires a mass [2,3]. but in the

euclidean approach which we have adopted in our anal-
ysis this subtlety may not be a serious drawback [13].
2) our analysis conrms that it is the restricted qcd
which plays the central role in the connement of color
[2,12]. it has all the non-abelian characters of qcd, with
the multiple vacuua and the topological monopoles. it is
the condensation of this non-abelian monopoles which
triggers the dual meissner eect. with the decomposi-
tion (1) the valence gluon ~x becomes a colored source
which one can add to (or remove from) the theory at
ones disposal, and is not likely to play any important
role in the connement mechanism.
3) it must be clear from our analysis that the monopole
condensation is a generic feature of the non-abelian
gauge theory. in fact a generalization of the above anal-
ysis to an arbitrary group g should be straightforward
[2,3]. the connection can be decomposed into the dual
potential degrees of the maximal abelian subgroup h
and the gauge covariant valence gluon degrees of g/h.
the monopole condensation could be obtained by inte-
grating out all the dynamical degrees of the non-abelian
gauge potential.

a more detailed discussion, including the generaliza-
tion of our result to su (3), will be presented in a forth-
coming paper [13].
