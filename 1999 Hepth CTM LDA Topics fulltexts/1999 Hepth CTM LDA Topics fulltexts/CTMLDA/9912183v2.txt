abstract

we describe in detail the techniques needed to compute scattering am-
plitudes for colored scalars from the innite tension limit of bosonic string
theory, up to two loops. these techniques apply both to cubic and quartic in-
teractions, and to planar as well as nonplanar diagrams. the resulting eld
theories are naturally dened in the spacetime dimension in which they are
renormalizable. with a careful analysis of string moduli space in the schottky
representation we determine the region of integration for the moduli, which
plays a crucial role in the derivation of the correct combinatorial and color
factors for all diagrams.

1 introduction

it is well known that all perturbative states in string theory have a squared mass
proportional to the string tension t . thus, in the lowenergy regime (or zero
slope limit,  = 1/(2t )  0), the heavy string states become innitely massive
and decouple, while the light states survive and their dynamics can be eectively
described by an ordinary eld theory. it was understood, already in the old days of
dual models, that one can dene this pointlike limit in dierent ways, so that it is
possible to recover dierent eld theories. in the rst application of this idea [1], the
treelevel amplitudes of a scalar eld theory with cubic interactions were derived
from the corresponding amplitudes among scalar string states; it was then shown
that, if massless spin1 states are selected, in the lowenergy limit one can reproduce
the tree diagrams of yangmills theory [2], while, if closed string are considered,
one obtains the amplitudes of einsteins gravity [3, 4].

in more recent years further steps were taken, and string techniques were actu-
ally exploited as a simplifying tool that can substitute feynman diagrams for the
explicit calculation of scattering amplitudes and other quantities of interest in eld
theory. for example, eective actions and threshold eects of interest for string
unication were computed in [5, 6, 7]; stringinspired techniques were applied to
the evaluation of oneloop qcd scattering amplitudes [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and renor-
malization constants [13, 14, 15]; graviton scattering amplitudes were computed and
their relation to gauge amplitudes explored [16, 17]; progress was made towards the
extension of the method to more than one loop [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], to amplitudes
with external fermions [24], and to oshell amplitudes [25]. string techniques also
served to stimulate the development of new techniques in eld theory, that preserve
some of the nice features of the string formalism [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31].

at rst sight, the use of extended object for constructing particle scattering
amplitudes may appear as an unnecessary detour, since one is interested only in
the zeroslope limit. however, as is now well understood, this procedure presents
many useful features. for instance, string amplitudes are naturally written in a way
that takes maximal advantage of gauge invariance, and the color decomposition is
automatically performed. at higher order in the perturbative expansion, further
advantages become apparent: the loop momentum integrals are already performed,
so that helicity methods can be readily employed, and the result for a set of feyn-
man diagrams of a given topology is presented directly as a schwingerparameter
integral. moreover, one does not nd the large proliferation of diagrams charac-
teristic of eld theories, which makes it extremely dicult to perform high order
calculations. in the case of closed strings one gets only one diagram at each order,
while in the open string the number of diagrams remains small. finally, in the case
of bosonic strings, the expressions of scattering amplitudes and of the measure of
integration on moduli space are known explicitly for an arbitrary perturbative or-
der; in the sewing procedure [32, 33], they can be obtained from tree level diagrams

1

by identifying pairs of external legs with an appropriate propagator.

on general grounds, a striking dierence between eldtheoretic and string
derived amplitudes is the degree of correlation in the calculation of dierent am-
plitudes in dierent eld theories. in eld theory, dierent amplitudes are largely
independent of each other, and thus in each computation one has to start from the
same basic ingredients, the feynman rules; also, results obtained in one theory can
rarely be exploited in computations for a dierent theory: in fact, introducing some
modication in the dening feynman rules, all subsequent results are aected. in
the string approach, the situation is dierent: the basic ingredients of all calcula-
tions always arise from quantities dened on the string worldsheet, and thus are
not dependent on the specic denition of the eld theory limit one may consider.
in particular, the building blocks are the measure of integration over string moduli
and the laplacian green function on the string worldsheet, essentially the two
point correlator of twodimensional scalar elds. this means that a large fraction of
the calculation is done in a general framework, without specifying which states will
be selected by the eld theory limit. all these results can then be exploited for de-
riving dierent amplitudes in a given eld theory, or even for calculations applying
to dierent eld theories. for instance, the number of external particles does not
play such a dramatic role in determining the complexity of the calculation. as we
will show explicitly in the twoloop case, one can learn a lot of information about
the shape of the relevant string worldsheets by studying simple vacuum bubble
diagrams. the results obtained in this way will not be modied by the insertion
of external legs. similarly, there are relations among calculations in dierent theo-
ries; in fact, one chooses a specic eld theory only when one selects, in the string
master formula, the contributions of a specic state. technically this step simply
amounts to a taylor expansion of all functions appearing in the string amplitude,
keeping the appropriate powers of the variables describing the string worldsheet.
clearly, the building blocks of the calculation are not modied by changing the
string state one focuses on; also, the overall normalization and the integration re-
gion over string moduli are xed once and for all. in general, this unifying way of
treating amplitudes of dierent theories brings many simplications; for instance,
the tensor algebra associated with the propagation of spin1 (or spin2) particles is
bypassed, and the computational complexity of these amplitudes is almost reduced
to that of scalar amplitudes.

despite all the advantages just described, so far the technique has been fully
applied only to massive scalars and to massless gauge bosons and gravitons, and has
been completely successful only at one loop. there are several technical reasons for
this limitation: the extension to fermions requires in principle the use of superstring
amplitudes, and the multiloop technology in that case has not yet been completely
developed; the extension to massive particles with spin is in principle possible, how-
ever one should realize that string theory is clearly illequipped to reproduce eld
theories with several mass scales, since all scales at the string level are proportional
to the string tension t ; nally, the extension to two and more loops has proved

2

harder than expected, because it requires a detailed understanding of multiloop
string moduli space, whose corners contributing to the eld theory limit manage
to reconstruct the particle amplitudes in a highly nontrivial way. the present
paper is a step towards the solution of the problems connected with the application
of string techniques to multiloop diagrams. in particular, we study the twoloop
open string moduli space, determine the correct integration region over moduli and
punctures in the eld theory limit, and show how dierent corners of moduli space
cooperate to reconstruct individual feynman diagrams, with the correct symmetry
and color factors.

in this paper we focus on the study of scalar interactions. this means that
both for external and for propagating states we will select the contributions com-
ing from the open string tachyon, a lorentz scalar taking values in the adjoint
representation of the chanpaton group, which we shall take to be u(n). in sec-
tion 2 we will introduce the technical tools needed for the computation of bosonic
string amplitudes, and the schottky parametrization of the string worldsheet. in
section 3 we will show how one can dene two dierent pointparticle limits, by
matching in dierent ways the eld coupling constant g, which is kept xed when
 0, to the unique string coupling gs. the two matchings lead to a cubic scalar
interaction in d = 6  2, and to a quartic scalar interaction in d = 4  2, respec-
tively. each eld theory naturally arises in the spacetime dimension in which it is
renormalizable, essentially because the string scale in the intermediate stages plays
the role of a renormalization scale, and disappears from the matching conditions
when the eld coupling becomes dimensionless. as a rst check, some treelevel
amplitudes are derived from the string master formula.
in section 4 we turn to
oneloop diagrams, which are fairly straightforward to handle, and thus serve as a
useful preliminary to twoloop calculations. we give explicit expressions for multi
leg oneparticleirreducible diagrams both for cubic and quartic interactions, and
we show how nonplanar color structures (subleading in the largen limit) are cor-
rectly reproduced in the string framework. finally, in section 5, we turn to the more
challenging problem of twoloop diagrams. dierent calculations are presented, up
to the fourpoint amplitude, both for cubic and quartic interactions. we present a
detailed analysis of the twoloop moduli space in the eld theory limit, which leads
us to recover the correct results including the normalization factors1. indeed, it is
clear that for these more complicated diagrams the color decomposition and the
combinatoric coecients are obtained more easily from the string approach than
from usual eld theory techniques. in section 6 we present our conclusions, and
our current assessment of the status of our method.

1a dierent method to identify the regions of moduli space corresponding to twoloop quar-
tic interactions, and to compute the corresponding amplitudes, has recently been introduced in
ref. ([34]).

2 multiloop scalar amplitudes in string theory

as we have already anticipated, in bosonic string theory it is possible to write in
a compact form a generic loop amplitude among string states, with an arbitrary
number of loops and external legs. this formula can be immediately specialized to
the case where all external states are scalars. the full, normalized, hloop scattering
amplitude [19] of m tachyons with momenta p1, . . . , pm , can be written as

a(h)

m (p1, . . . , pm ) =

.

(2.1)

here gs is the dimensionless string coupling constant, and the product of traces
is the appropriate u(n) chanpaton factor for a generic hloop diagram with
h + 1 boundaries labelled by the index r.
in the planar case it becomes simply
n h tr(a1    am ). g(h)
ri,rj is the correlator of two worldsheet bosons located at zi
on the boundary labelled ri, and at zj on the boundary rj, while [dm]m
is the
h
measure of integration over moduli space for an open riemann surface with h
loops and m punctures. notice that since we consider u(n) as a gauge group,
we have to take into account only string amplitudes with oriented worldsheets;
thus nonplanar diagrams arise only when loops are formed by sewing together two
nonconsecutive punctures. here we will not be interested in the exact expression
of the geometric objects appearing in eq. (2.1), which can be found in [35]; rather,
we will focus on their general features, in order to emphasize the properties which
play a crucial role in the eld theory limit. for a more complete presentation of
the mathematical tools we will briey describe here, we refer to ref. [35]. as is
well known, the schottky parametrization is particularly suited for the study of
the eld theory limit, so we will work always within this framework. in fig. 3, in
section 4, and fig. 6, in section 5, we present the one and the twoloop string
worldsheets in the schottky representation. it is easy to see how the idea of adding
loops is implemented in this formalism. one starts from the upper half complex
plane (equivalent to the disk, representing the treelevel scattering amplitude), and
adds two circles with the same radius and with centers on the real axis, which must
then be identied via a projective transformation. each loop is thus characterized
by three real parameters: the positions of the two centers on the real axis, and
the radius of the circles, which x respectively the position and the width of the
holes added to the surface. the positions of the various circles are related to the
xed points of the projective transformations under which the pairs of circles are
identied, usually denoted by  and , ( = 1, . . . , h), while the width of the holes
is determined by the third parameter characterizing the projective transformation,
the multiplier k. it is possible to use the projective invariance of string theory to

4

x the location of up to three of the punctures zi, or of the xed points, but one
cannot x the multipliers, which in fact drive the eld theory limit.
in general,
it is convenient to x, say, two s and one , except in the oneloop case, where
one has only two xed points; in this case one also species the position of one of
the punctures. in the eld theory limit, the surface must degenerate into a graph,
and all massive string modes must decouple. one can show in general [18] that
the relevant region of string moduli space is the region k  0, and furthermore
the taylor expansion of the integrand of the string amplitude in powers of the
multipliers corresponds to a sum over the mass levels of the states circulating in the
loops. thus, for the eld theory limit of scalar amplitudes, we can always ignore all
higher powers in the multipliers. in this limit, the integration measure in eq. (2.1)
reads

h = (a, b, c)

h

y=1" dk d d

 (  )2# [det (i )]d/2  m
yi=1

v i (0)! ,

(2.2)

where the factor (a, b, c) is the faddeevpopov determinant associated with
the xing of the overall projective invariance, and  is the period matrix of the
surface, whose explicit expression at one and two loops will be given in eqs. (4.6) and
(5.7) below. note that all the dependence on the external states is concentrated
in the last term. the factors v i (0) originate from the need to introduce local
coordinates on the surface, vi(z), around each puncture, in order to perform the
sewing procedure. before discussing their role, let us introduce explicit expressions
for the green functions we will need. also in this case, we report here just the
leading term in the taylor expansion in the multipliers (see [35] for the complete
string expressions). at one loop, if the two punctures are on the same boundary,
one nds [15]

g(1) (zi, zj) = log |zi  zj| +

otherwise one must use the non-planar green function

g(1)
n p (zi, zj) = log |zi + zj| +

2 log k

log2 |zi|
|zj|

.

(2.4)

notice that in eqs. (2.3) and (2.4) we have already chosen the projective gauge
 = 0 and   , so that only the multiplier k appears explicitly. at two loops
the bosonic green function becomes a little more complicated because one has to
deal with a nontrivial dependence on the moduli of the two holes. in the planar
case

g(2)(z1, z2) = log |z1  z2| +

(z1  2)(z2  2)

,

,

.

(2.6)

as was already noticed in [15], at one loop, these green functions do not have
the expected periodicity properties. this is not really surprising, since it is known
that the factor exp[g(zi, zj)] appearing in the master equation (2.1) has conformal
weight (1/2, 1/2) in the two variables (zi,zj) and not zero. thus to give a global
denition to eq. (2.1), one should multiply it by a function of conformal weight
(1/2, 1/2). this suggests that one can recover a well behaved geometric object
if the local coordinates v i (0) compensate for this problem by having conformal
weight 1. a natural choice is to dene the v i (0) by using the inverse of the
abelian dierentials, which are the only globally dened objects having conformal
weight one. by following this idea one recovers at one loop the choice made in [15]
where v i (0) = 1(zi) = zi, since, in this case, there is a unique abelian dierential,
(z) = 1/z. at two loops, one is lead to identify the inverse of v i (0) with a linear
combination of the two dierentials 1(zi) and 2(zi); to x the normalization,
we will follow ref. [21], and require that this linear combination be normalized to
one when one integrates it around the eld theory propagator on which the leg is
inserted. this is sucient to x the local coordinates for the purpose of the scalar
eld theory limit.

the string expressions reported here contain just the leading order in the mul-
tipliers; moreover, as we anticipated in the introduction, in order to derive the eld
theory limit of eq. (2.1), one has to expand the integrand also in powers of all the
other variables. the logarithmic terms, however, are nonanalytic and must have
a special status. in fact, it turns out that they measure the length of eld theory
propagators in units of , and so are directly related to the schwinger proper times
of the limiting eld theory. this means that, technically, the zeroslope limit has
to be taken after introducing the eld theory variables that have to be kept xed:
the string coupling constant has to be translated to the appropriate eld theory
coupling, while the logarithmic terms in the integrand must be interpreted in terms
of proper times, in general as ln (x)  t/. the exact form of this change of inte-
gration variables depends on the particular corner of moduli space considered, as
we will see in detail in the following sections.

although we gave explicit expressions for all functions entering in eq. (2.1),
our master formula is still a formal expression, since we have not yet specied the
exact region of integration of the various parameters. we do not attempt to solve

6

this problem in its most general form; however, in the following sections, we will
determine the correct region of integration, at least in the eld theory limit, for
the one and twoloop diagrams. here we just anticipate the basic idea. one
starts by considering the vacuum amplitudes, where it is possible to focus only
on the worldsheet shape, without having to consider external punctures. in this
way one determines the region of integrations over the xed points, by requiring
that the surface never become singular; on the other hand, the integration over the
multipliers is xed by symmetry arguments and is chosen in order to avoid double
counting of equivalent congurations. when external legs are added, this setup is
not essentially modied. from this analysis of the string worldsheet one can draw
a clear representation of the various boundaries of the surface, and the punctures
can take all possible values on these boundaries.

3 treelevel matching conditions

we begin our analysis of the eld theory limit by establishing the relationships
between the string coupling and the couplings of the cubic and quartic theories
we want to reproduce. this is done, as in eective eld theory, by computing the
simplest amplitudes both with strings and elds, and matching the results. the
string amplitude is, of course, uniquely dened: dierent matchings correspond to
dierent ways of taking the innite tension limit, and they lead to dierent eld
theories in dierent dimensions. having established the connection between the
couplings, we go on to describe the computation of simple tree diagrams, with up
to six external legs.

the onshell, treelevel, colorordered, mpoint scalar amplitude in bosonic
string theory is readily derived from eq. (2.1), by choosing as green function sim-
ply g(zi, zj) = ln|zi  zj|. the result is the correctly normalized kobanielsen
amplitude,

remaining integrals range between 0 and 1.

turning to eld theory, let us rst consider a scalar u(n) theory dened by the

(3.6)

where  =  is a scalar eld taking values in the adjoint representation of u(n),
and our generators are normalized by tr() = /2. feynman rules for scalar
u(n) theories and several useful formulas for color structures are collected in the
appendix. the colorordered 3point amplitude (dened as i times the relevant
feynman diagram) in this theory is simply

a(0)

3 (p1, p2, p3) = 2g3 tr (a1a2a3)

comparison with eq. (3.3) yields the matching condition

g3 = 4gs (2)(d6)/4

,

(3.7)

(3.8)

already derived in [19]. note that the coupling is dimensionless in d = 6, as it
must. we can now use eq. (3.8) to compute higher order scattering amplitudes in
the theory dened by eq. (3.6), using the string master formula. as a rst simple
example, consider the 4point amplitude, which becomes

2note that here we use a convention slightly dierent from the one employed in ref. [19]; in
particular we choose a coupling constant g3 which is four times bigger than the one of [19], in
order to reduce the number of factors of two in the amplitudes.

8

to get a sensible zero slope limit we must extract from the integral a factor ()1.
this can be done by focusing on the potentially singular regions z  0 and z  1,
corresponding to s and tchannel exchange respectively (the uchannel diagram
cannot contribute to this color structure). according to the general discussion of
section 2, and considering the region z  0, we do this by setting z = exp(tz/),
with tz nite and   0. neglecting o() corrections, the change of variables
yields

which exactly matches the correct result in eld theory, provided the string metric
is used.

it is clear that the dierent diagrams contributing to a given color ordering
arise from dierent corners of string moduli space, and they are easily identied
by the pole structure of their propagators. to illustrate this in a slightly less
trivial conguration, let us consider the 6point amplitude in eq. (3.5), and let us
attempt to separate the contributions to two dierent given diagrams, say those
portrayed in fig. 1. using the matching condition, eq. (3.8), one easily sees that

the string amplitude is proportional to ()3, so that we need to take a limit in all
three integration variables, which corresponds to the extraction of three propagator
poles. if we want to specify the region in moduli space relevant for diagram a, we
must qualitatively have z5 very close to z6 = 0, and z3 very close to z4. moreover the

three pairs of variables (z1, z2), (z3, z4) and (z5, z6) have to be kept widely separated
from each other. the desired change of variables is

precisely the desired result.

for the other diagram of fig. 1, one has to consider a dierent change of vari-
ables; in particular, since now we do not want to group external particles in pairs,
all zis must be taken widely separated. thus the corresponding ordered proper
times are simply dened as ti =  ln zi. following the same steps just described,
it is the easy to check that the expected result for diagram b is obtained. we
note in passing that nding the numerical coecient of a given color ordering for
a given feynman diagram may be a rather cumbersome task with the conventional
feynman rules, whereas it is immediate here.

let us now turn our attention to quartic interactions. we want to reconstruct

the amplitudes derived from the lagrangian

l4 = trh  m22 + g44i

which, in particular, yields the colorordered vertex

(3.16)

the starting point is now eq. (3.4), where however in this case we do not need to
generate any extra powers of , as was done to go from eq. (3.9) to eq. (3.10). here
the overall dimensionality is correct, so all we need to do is take the   0 limit
and integrate over z without introducing any weight in special corners of moduli
space. in other words, the quartic vertex arises from integration over nite regions

of moduli space, and not from its boundaries (regions of innitesimal size in the
eld theory limit). as   0, the integrand of eq. (3.4) simply becomes 1, so we
get
(3.17)

.

comparison with eq. (3.16) yields the matching condition

g4 = 4g2

s (2)(d4)/2

.

(3.18)

the same matching condition might have been obtained in a dierent way, by rst
considering the 3 diagrams contributing to a(0)
4 , and then explicitly deleting the
internal propagators by setting their proper times to 0, inserting in turn a (tz/)
and a ((t  tz)/). these  functions should however be regularized, since they
are located at the boundaries of the integration region. in such circumstances it is
natural to weigh each  function with a factor 1/2, and this reproduces the matching
in eq. (3.18). this second method is closer in spirit to the techniques of [34].

to show that this procedure can be generalized to higher order amplitudes, let
us consider also for 4 a particular diagram contributing to the 6point amplitude.
note that there are 105 diagrams contributing to the 3 6point amplitude, but
only 10 with quartic vertices. we consider, as an example, the diagram depicted in
fig. 2. using the matching condition eq. (3.18) in the string amplitude, eq. (3.5),

one sees that the amplitude has an overall factor of . thus we need to take
precisely one singular limit in one of the integration variables, corresponding to
the extraction of a single propagator pole. for the particular diagram at hand,
qualitatively, we would like to keep z4 and z5 close to z6 = 0, while leaving z3 close
to 1. this can be achieved by the change of variables

z3 = x
z4 = et4/
z5 = y et4/

,

(3.19)

with no proper times associated with x and y. neglecting as usual terms suppressed
by powers of , we get

where we neglected o(k) terms in the measure of integration that will not contribute
to the eld theory limit, and we have introduced the local coordinates vi(z), accord-
ing to the general discussion of section 2. projective invariance has been used to
choose the xed points of the single schottky generator as  = 0 and   , and
to x z1 = 1. in this conguration the worldsheet of the string (an annulus) can be
represented as in fig. 3. for a planar conguration, all punctures are constrained

to lie on the same boundary of the string world sheet, thus, having xed z1 = 1,
all other zi should be integrated over the interval b = k < zi < b = 1/k, with
the restriction on the ordering implied by the color trace. this would complicate
the calculation of the eld theory limit, since there would be contributions both

onto the interval [k,k]. in fact, dening the eective oneloop green function by

(4.2)

and choosing v i (0) = zi, according to our general discussion, it is easy to check
that the eective green function at the string level is a function only of the ratio
ij = zi/zj, and satises

g(1) (ji, k) = g(1) (ij, k)
g(1) (kji, k) = g(1) (ij, k)

.

(4.3)

using these properties, one can map all congurations with a subset of punctures in
the interval [1, 1/k] to congurations in which those punctures have been moved
to the interval [k,k], preserving the ordering on the circle. this procedure yields
the integration region in eq. (4.1). in the eld theory (k  0) limit the eective
green function has the form

g(1) (zi, zj; k) = log s zi

for zi > zj.

the generalization of eq. (4.1) to the case of nonplanar diagrams is known [36],
and easily understood. a non planar diagram has punctures on both boundaries,
so the factor of n = tr1 is replaced by the trace of the chanpaton factors cor-

responding to the punctures on the second boundary (the interval [1/k,k]

in fig. 3). the region of integration of the corresponding zi is an ordered region
on the negative real axis. the string green function involving two punctures on
the negative real axis is precisely the same as the one discussed above, since it is
a function only of the ratio ij, which remains positive when both zs change sign.
the only subtlety involves the green function connecting punctures on dierent
boundaries. in this case the terms in the green function arising from loop momen-
tum integration behave dierently, and one should choose v i (0) = |zi|, so that the
green function remains real, and does not have any singularity when |zi|  |zj|. in
the eld theory limit one nds simply

|zi|

where the two zs have opposite signs.

as usual, the eld theory limit is governed by the multiplier k, which must be taken
to be exponentially suppressed as   0, so that the length of the string loop may
become innite in units of . the tachyon double pole is regulated, as described
in ref. ([19]), by setting dk/k2 = exp(m2 log k) dk/k. the appropriate change of

all puncture coordinates must become exponentially small as   0, so that
the correct power of  may be generated. dening the feynman parameters as

compared with the eldtheoretic result,

where xij = xi  xj. we note in passing that deriving the coecient of the leading
color trace from the feynman rules is not trivial for the general diagram with n
legs. in fact, the above could be considered as a simple proof that the coecient
is n for any n. the expression for the integrand as a function of the parameters
xi also appears automatically in the most symmetric form; note that this is the
correct form for arbitrary values of the external momenta pi, on or oshell.

before going on to perform a similar calculation for quartic interactions, it is
worthwhile to pause to consider two instructive special cases of eq. (4.8), and a
slight generalization of it in the case of the fourpoint function. first of all we
would like to point out that eq. (4.8) holds in eld theory for all n, including
n = 2, because of what appears at rst sight as a fortunate coincidence: in fact in
eld theory the color factor for the two point function is twice the one appearing
in eq. (4.8), essentially because tr(ab) = tr(ba). however this factor of 2 is
compensated by a symmetry factor of 1/2, which is only present for the twopoint
amplitude. string theory takes into account these two facts simultaneously and
automatically.

another unexpected feature of the twopoint function in eld theory is the fact
that, if one allows the external scalars to take values in the u(1) factor of u(n), that
is if one allows the indices a, b to take the value 0, one nds that the color factor
of the corresponding diagram doubles. this is easily seen from eqs. (a.10) and
(a.12), in the appendix. this fact is unexplained from the point of view of feynman
diagrams, but it has a natural explanation in string theory. in fact, if in string theory
we allow the external legs to be color singlets, the amplitude receives a contribution
from a new diagram, the one with the two legs inserted on dierent world sheet
boundaries. this diagram, which is nonplanar from the point of view of string
theory, contributes at the same order in n because with a correctly normalized u(1)
0)tr(1) = (tr(0))2. furthermore,
generator (see the appendix) on nds that tr(2
it is easy to check that the functional form of this new diagram is precisely the same
as that of the original diagram, with the same overall factor and integration region.
this is the rst simple example of the correct handling of nonplanar contribution
in string theory.

we conclude this section by giving a further nontrivial example of a non
planar contribution to a oneloop amplitude. we consider the fourpoint function,
which in eld theory yields contributions proportional to double color traces, such
as tr(a1a4)tr(a2a3). these double trace contributions naturally arise in string
theory from the simultaneous insertion of punctures on the two dierent string
boundaries. in eld theory, on the other hand, these terms receive contributions
from dierent feynman diagrams. choosing for example the cyclic order (1, 2, 3, 4)
for the external legs, the complete color factor in eld theory is given by

c1234 = n [tr (a1a2a3a4) + tr (a4a3a2a1)]

+ 2tr (a1a2) tr (a3a4) + 2tr (a1a3) tr (a2a4)
+ 2tr (a1a4) tr (a2a3)

,

(4.9)

15

so that the coecient of the chosen term is 2. one should keep in mind, how-
ever, that the particular color structure tr(a1a4)tr(a2a3) receives contributions
also from two other distinct feynman diagrams, corresponding to the noncyclic
permutations of the external particles in the original one (in the present case, the
orderings (1, 3, 2, 4) and (1, 4, 2, 3)). string theory must, and does, assemble the
contributions of the dierent diagrams to the chosen color structure into a single
string conguration. this can be veried by using the non-planar green function
eq. (4.5), and considering all possible ways of inserting the punctures on the bound-
aries. since we wish to place the puncture z4 on the same boundary as z1 = 1, it
must lie on the positive real axis in fig. 3. as explained above, this leads to the
integration region k  z4  1. for the other two punctures, on the negative axis,
the integration region is 1  {z2, z3}  k, with no restriction on the relative
ordering of z2 and z3. changing variables to x2 = z2 and x3 = z3, we have once
again four punctures on the positive real axis, which can be placed in the interval
[k, z1 = 1] in six dierent orderings. note that the six orderings are distinguishable
in the eld theory limit, because the logarithmic term in the generic green function
has a dierent eld theory limit depending on the ordering, log(zi  zj)  log(zi),
for zi > zj. an explicit calculation shows that the orderings x2  x3  z4 and
z4  x3  x2 conspire to reconstruct the contribution to the chosen trace of the
eld theory diagram with cyclic ordering (1, 2, 3, 4), with the correct overall factor
of 2. similarly, the orderings x2  z4  x3 and x3  z4  x2 reconstruct the con-
tribution of the diagram with cyclic ordering (1, 2, 4, 3), while the remaining two
orderings give the last diagram. once again, the building blocks of the nal result
are assembled in novel and nontrivial way.

4.2 oneloop quartic interactions

as in the previous section, it is possible to give a general expression for the oneloop,
colorordered, oneparticleirreducible diagram with n external legs, but only quar-
tic vertices, shown in fig. 5. using the matching condition eq. (3.18) in eq. (4.1),

the integrals in dyi, ranging over nite regions of moduli space, are logarithmically
divergent and need to be regularized. this divergence is actually a further mani-
festation of the tachyonic nature of the bosonic string ground state, and must be
dealt with by the same method used to handle the double pole dk/k2: one must
substitute y1
i  exp(m2 log yi). in this case, however, there is no proper time
associated with yi so the exponential factors are suppressed as   0 and must
be neglected. the product of all dyi integrals then yields simply a factor of unity.
this procedure can be further justied by noting that the factors of y1
arise from
the factors (v i (0))1 in eq. (4.1), which are characteristic of tachyon propagation
and are absent, for example, in gluon amplitudes. in fact eq. (4.1) can be consis-
tently continued to an arbitrary value of the string intercept a = m2
6= 1, as
was done in [37]. in that case one nds that the measure of integration changes
as dk/(k2qi v i (0))  (dk/k)(kqi v i (0))a, indicating that the singularities gen-

erated by the projective transformations v i (0) are of the same type as the double
pole in the multiplier k.

once again, this matches the result arising from the feynman diagram in fig. 5,
with the restriction that paired external legs must not be of the same color. this
provides a simple proof of the fact that for such diagrams the coecient of the
leading color trace is 2n/2n.

we conclude this section by noting a special case that arises in the computation
of these loop amplitudes, when two consecutive external particles ((2n  1, 2n))
annihilate in two colorless states running in the loop. let us, for instance, focus
on the special case of eq. (4.13) where n = 2; this of course represents a tadpole
diagram. for this diagram eq. (4.13) yields

which is one half of the result obtained in eld theory. this discrepancy can be
understood by observing that the color factor in eld theory is of the form

cab = 8 ntr(ab) = dabd

 + 2dad 

b

.

(4.15)

the rst contraction of dtensors, which contributes one half of the total result,
represents an anomalous color ow corresponding to a 3 tadpole diagram, in
which the colored scalars a and b = a annihilate into a color singlet state which
then selfinteracts. clearly in this channel the full u(n) color ow is prohibited,
and only the u(1) factor contributes. this term is missed by eq. (4.13), but can
be reproduced by rst generating a oneparticlereducible 3 diagram and then
deleting the zeromomentum propagator, thus attaching the loop to the external
legs. a similar peculiarity will arise when we will consider the twoloop 4 vacuum
bubbles. also in that case a tadpolelike conguration forcing the color ow to be
restricted to u(1) is present. this kind of term is always related to corners of moduli
space corresponding to oneparticlereducible diagrams, and this is signaled by a
color factor which displays a combinations of d symbols typical of these diagrams.

5 twoloop diagrams

generalizing the approach described in the previous section to the twoloop case
is not a straightforward task. first, the explicit expressions of the measure and of

18

the other geometrical objects present in eq. (2.1) are more complex, so that the
computation of physically interesting quantities (such as yangmills amplitudes)
has to be performed by means of a computer program. second, there are also
conceptual novelties, and the procedure described in the previous section cannot
be applied directly to a twoloop calculation. many of the new features are related
to the fact that now the string worldsheet is a twoannulus and some of the
simplifying choices that are usually made at oneloop are not possible any more. for
example, in eq. (4.1) the xed points played no role, because they could be gauge
xed to zero and innity. in twoloop calculations, on the other hand, the shape
of the string worldsheet can vary in a nontrivial manner. in fact, the measure
eq. (2.2) crucially depends on at least one of the xed points, which means that the
relative position of the two holes cannot be xed. thus, for a better understanding
of the new geometrical features, it is worthwhile to start the study of twoloop
string amplitudes by considering in detail the schottky parametrization, as it arises
from the sewing procedure leading to eq. (2.1). basically, the twoloop surface can
be constructed starting at one loop and identifying two external legs. this is done
by cutting away from the oneloop string worldsheet two circles, and identifying
their boundaries. if one chooses to sew together the puncture xed at z1 = 1 with
one of the other legs on the same boundary (i.e. with zi > 0 in order to construct
a planar diagram), one obtains the twoloop surface depicted in fig. 6.

we x projective invariance by choosing 2 = 0, 2   and 1 = 1. then the
positions and radii of the circles in fig. 6 are completely determined as functions
of the multipliers k1, k2 and of the xed point 1; in fact, following [19], one can
verify that

b = a = qk2 , c =

d =

, c =

1 + 1k1
1 + k1

1  k1
1  k1

1  k1

, d =

1 + k1
1 + k1

,

, b = a =

1
k2

.

(5.1)

(5.2)

one can check that the points a, b, c and d are identied with a, b, c and d,
respectively, under the action of the two generators of the twoloop schottky group,
i.e. the projective transformations mapping the circles k1,2 into their images k1,2.
by cutting open a twoannulus, it is possible to map the two segments (aa) and

(dd) onto the inner boundaries of the worldsheet, which is natural since their
length depends only on k1 and k2. then the union of (bc) and (cb) represents
the external boundary. note that, in order to avoid a degenerate surface, the
various identied circles should not overlap. this simple consideration gives a rst
constraint on the region of integration of the string moduli. in fact, by requiring
that b does not touch c one obtains

figure 6: in the schottky parametrization, the twoannulus corresponds to the part
of the upperhalf plane which is inside the big circle passing through a and b,
and which is outside the circles k1, k1 and k2.

while the same requirement on the segment (dd) leads to

d  d =

1  k1
1 + k1

(1  1) ,

(5.4)

so that  < 1. now the interpretation of the three moduli, k1, k2 and 1, is
particularly simple. in fact, k2 is the radius of the circle k2, while the radii of k1
and k1 are equal and depend on k1

rk1 = qk1(cid:18) 1  1

1  k1(cid:19) .

(5.5)

furthermore, 1 turns out to be inside k1, while the point 1 = 1 is inside k1.
therefore, in this conguration, the circle k1 is xed while k1 can move, depending
on the value of 1. in particular, if the point d is very close to d, 1 is almost equal
to 1, while if c is near to b, then 1 is of order of k1 + k2. in other words, it is
possible to interpret 1 as the distance between the two loops. when 1  1, one
may expect the eld theory limit (at least for cubic interactions) to yield reducible
diagrams with the two loops widely separated, while when 1  k1 +k2  0 one

should obtain the irreducible diagrams with the two loops attached to each other.
another observation relevant for deriving the region of integration of world
sheet moduli is that in the explicit form of all geometrical objects (for instance,
the green function or the measure) the multipliers k1 and k2 appear symmetrically,
reecting the equivalence of the two loops. therefore, in order to avoid double
counting of equivalent congurations, one can order the multipliers, by choosing
for example k2 < k1. note that the multipliers will always be associated with
eld theory proper times, so in the zeroslope limit their ordering should always be
interpreted as strong ordering.

a nal remark has to be made about the possibility of taking the attractive
xed point  bigger in modulus than the repulsive one . as was shown in [38], in
the closed string case these congurations are related to the one with || < || by
the residual part of the modular invariance group which survives in the eld theory
limit. in the open string case there is no modular invariance, but these surfaces
should describe the propagation of closed string states, and they should not be
included in our analysis. thus, for our purposes, we will always restrict || to be

20

less than ||. summarizing, we have found for k1, k2 and 1, in the eld theory
limit, the same region of integration derived by roland [38] for the closed string,
i.e. 0  k2 < k1 < |1|  1. we are now ready to move on to the evaluation of

twoloop diagrams, starting with the simplest ones to verify our assumptions.

5.1 vacuum bubbles

let us start by briey describing the simplest amplitude, the twoloop vacuum
bubble with cubic interaction. in this case (m = 0 and h = 2), with the projec-
tive gauge choice and integration region described above, and using the matching
condition for cubic interaction , eq. (3.8), eq. (2.1) simply becomes

in eq. (5.6) only the determinant of the period matrix is needed; at leading order
in the two multipliers, it is

42 hlog k1 log k2  log2 i .

(5.7)

note that, as expected, the two multipliers k1 and k2 play the same role and all the
expressions are symmetrical in the exchange of k1 and k2.

as discussed in the previous section, we expect a contribution to the eld theory
result from the limit 1  1 (together with k1, k2  0); in this case, the appropriate
change of variables is

t1 =  log k1 ,

t2 =  log k2 ,

t3 =  log(1  1) .

since eq. (5.9) is symmetrical in t1 and t2, it is possible to perform the integration
over t1 and t2 independently from 0 to  by introducing a factor of 1/2. in this way
one obtains the same result of the reducible vacuum bubble of the 3 eld theory
dened by eq. (3.6), including the correct normalization. again, the factor of 1/4
in the normalization of this diagram in eld theory is a combination of color and
symmetry factors, which are unied in the present approach.

the second expected contribution comes from the limit 1  0 and should give
the irreducible vacuum diagram. in this case each loop is made of two dierent

21

propagators, and this suggests a dierent identication between eld theory proper
times and string variables. in fact, the experience acquired at one loop leads us
to expect that the multipliers ki should be associated with the length of an entire
loop. thus we set

q1 =

= et1/

, q2 =

, q3 = 1 = et3/

.

(5.11)

since eq. (5.11) is completely symmetrical, we can introduce a factor of 1/3! and
perform the three integrals independently from 0 to . in this way one correctly
reproduces the irreducible vacuum bubble of our 3 theory. note that by using a
single starting formula, eq. (5.6), we have been able to obtain two diagrams which
have a dierent weight. while in eld theory this relative factor of 3 between the
two vacuum bubble amplitudes is due to the combination of dierent combinatorial
and color factors, in the string approach this relative normalization appears because
eq. (5.6) has dierent symmetry properties in the two regions of moduli space that
yield the two vacuum bubbles.

it is interesting to see what happens if one considers also nonplanar string
worldsheets. from fig. 6, one can see that a nonplanar surface may arise if the
circle k1 is centered on the negative axis. the identications established in the
planar case still hold and by following them it is easy to realize that the surface has
only one boundary. when  approaches to zero, the calculations follows exactly
the same pattern we have just seen and the result is again eq. (5.11), but with a
factor of n only, instead of n 3, since here we have only one boundary. if however
one tries to mimic the limit which gave the reducible bubble, that is ||  1, one
sees that there is no singularity in eq. (5.6). in fact, now  approaches 1 and it
is not possible to associate a schwinger proper time to the combination (1  ):
this corner of moduli space gives a vanishing contribution showing that only the
irreducible bubble receives subleading corrections in n. by using the equations
given in appendix, it is easy to recover the same result from a eld theory analysis.
we conclude our discussion of twoloop vacuum bubbles by briey considering
the single diagram arising in the case of quartic interaction. here we see at work
the mechanism that was suggested for the oneloop 4 tadpole, in section 4. in
fact, the eld theory color factor of the vacuum bubble is of the form

c = d

 d

 + 2 dd

= 2 n 3 + 2 n (n 2 + 1) ,

(5.12)

where we emphasized the dierent origin of the various factors of n. the symmetry
factor, on the other hand, is 1/8. using string theory, and the matching condition

22

eq. (3.18), one sees that the overall normalization of this diagram in the planar
case is n 3g4. now, however, one must introduce proper times only for the two
multipliers, since there are only two propagators in the diagram. thus the overall
symmetry factor for the completion of the integration region is 1/2 instead of 1/6,
for both color ow patterns. if we proposed to add them, it would appear that the
string gives a result too big by factor of two. the solution to this puzzle lies in the
observation that in both congurations one needs to integrate over a nite range in
, extending to   1, as in eq. (5.6). one must regulate the singularity as   1,
without having a proper time associated with 1  . singularities of this kind were
studied in refs. ([15, 22]), and the correct prescription (a  function regularization)
turns out to be that these integrals yield precisely a factor of 1/2. notice that the
nonplanar contribution can arise only from the irreducible diagram, which justies
the fact that the coecient of n in eq. (5.12) is 1/2 of the coecient of n 3.

5.2 twopoint amplitudes

in this section, scalar amplitudes with two external states are considered; in partic-
ular, the irreducible diagrams of fig. 7 are derived directly from eq. (2.1), without
using the simplied procedure described in [19]. instead, we follow the procedure
just employed for the vacuum bubbles and, for each diagram, we look at the ap-
propriate corners of the integration region of the various string variables. the new

the 3 theory.

ingredients needed in eq. (2.1) in presence of external particles are the twoloop
bosonic green function and, if one wants to extrapolate the result oshell, the new
expressions of the local coordinates v i (0). it was shown in [19, 20] that from the
green function in eq. (2.5) the general structure of twoloop 3 diagrams can be
recovered. moreover roland and sato showed in [20] that the string master formula
(2.1) reduces to the particle theory amplitudes in the worldline approach, even in
the multiloop case. however, in those papers there is no derivation for the region
of integration over the punctures zi; this should be given in terms of the parame-
ters determining the shape of twoloop worldsheet. lacking this information, it
is dicult to x the correct normalizations of the various diagrams, since dierent

23

corners of the region of integration over the punctures can contribute to the same
eld theory diagram. we will now show that, in order to determine the integration
region for the punctures zi, it is sucient to use the simple geometrical description
of fig. 6, and the analysis of vacuum amplitudes outlined in the previous sections.
in fact, as discussed in the introduction, a general feature of the string approach is
that the calculations of diagrams with dierent number of external legs are closely
related to each other. for instance, it is clear from the analysis of vacuum bubbles
that, in order to construct irreducible diagrams, the limit 1  0 must be consid-
ered. at this point one can freeze the worldsheet shape and put the punctures in
all possible congurations on the three boundaries, remembering that, since we are
interested in planar amplitudes, both states must lie on the same boundary of the
twoannulus.

let us start by considering the case in which the punctures are inserted on
the internal boundary represented by the segment (aa). they should then be

integrated in the interval [1/k2,k2]. analogously, if they are on the other

internal boundary, the region of integration is the interval [d, d], while for the
contributions of the external boundary each zi must be allowed to range between b
and c, and between c and b. in the conguration with small multipliers (qi  0)
the worldsheet becomes a graph, and each boundary degenerates into the union of
two distinct eld theory propagators. it is interesting to note that it is possible to
identify the specic corners of moduli space associated with each rst quantized eld
theory diagram, already at the string level. in fact, if z  [a, a], the contributions
obtained correspond to a diagram with the external particles always attached to
the rst loop; but it turns out that they are emitted from the propagator shared
by the two loops if z  [1,1], while the intervals z  [1, a] and z  [a,1]
correspond to emission from the propagator not shared with the second loop.
in order to show that this identication is correct, let us calculate the two
loop diagram with one external state in the region [1,1] and the other in the
region [a,1] that should contribute to the rst diagram of fig. 7. as for the local
coordinates, here we impose again that v i (0) = |zi|, since the punctures are on a
boundary that, from the point of view of the schottky parametrization, is identical
to the one encountered in the oneloop case. of course, other choices lead to the
correct result [19, 21] and only a yang-mills calculation, where higherorder terms
in qi are relevant, can discriminate among the various options. in this region, the
variable u of eq. (2.6) can be approximated as u  |z1|1. thus from eq. (2.1) one
can derive a rst contribution to the diagram in fig. 7, by treating the quadratic
poles of the qi variables in the usual way, and by introducing proper times ti as in
eq. (5.10). one nds

z1 + 2tz1tz2t1(cid:17) , (5.14)
and where  = (t1t2 + t1t3 + t2t3). the schwinger proper times tzi are related, as
expected, to the positions of the punctures by tzi =  log |zi|. it can be checked
that the integrand of eq. (5.13) is exactly what one expects from a eld theory
calculation, but the region of integration over proper times appears strange.
in
fact, the whole expression is not symmetric in the exchange of any two proper
times, unlike the case of vacuum diagrams, eq. (5.11). thus, it is not possible to
immediately complete the integration region of t1 and t3 extending it to innity;
moreover, from the eld theory analysis one would expect the proper time tz1 to
vary between 0 and t2, while the string result covers only part of this region.

these problems are treated by taking into account also the other regions of the
integration over the punctures that contribute to the eld theory diagram of fig. 6.

for instance, another conguration that should be considered is z2  [,k2]
with z1 remaining in the same interval as before. in this case u can be approximated
as u  /|z2|, and from eq. (2.1) one gets

these results seem completely dierent from eq. (5.13), and in fact it is dicult
to relate them to the diagram of fig. 6, since the green function is not the one
expected. however, this happens just because eq. (5.15) is not expressed in terms
of the most convenient variables; in fact, by changing tz1  t2+t3tz1 the integrand
in eq. (5.15) becomes exactly that of eq. (5.13) and the region of integration over
tz1 becomes the interval [ 1
2 (t2 + t3), t2]. at this point the two contributions can be
summed by simply extending the integration of tz1 from 0 to t2 and, as far as the
punctures are concerned, the expected eld theory result is obtained. note that the
integrand of eq. (5.13) is symmetric under the simultaneous exchanges tz1  tz2
t2  t3, as implied by the worldsheet representation of these regions of integration
(see fig. 8). this consideration suggests that the symmetry in the exchange among
t1, t2 and t3 must be obtained only when the external states are put on the other
two boundaries. in fact, when the two punctures are on the boundary (d, d) the
nal result is exactly that of eq. (5.13), but with the roles of t2 and t1 exchanged.
some changes should however be introduced into the procedure, since this boundary
is not in the usual oneloop form (that is with the multipliers at 0 and ). first,

25

.

the text.

the local coordinates should be expressed in terms of the abelian dierential of
this loop; second, the variables zi are not the ones that are directly related to the
schwinger proper times. in fact, the minimum value of z in this conguration is d,
eq. (5.1), and not k1, as one should expect from the symmetry with the case just
considered. in this case the string variable directly related to the schwinger proper
time is

z  1(cid:19) ,

x = (cid:18)z  
,k1], as expected by symmetry. with these

(5.17)

which ranges in the interval [ 1
k1
changes, the analysis of the integration on the second boundary is completely similar
to the one discussed above.

the contributions coming from the congurations with the punctures on the
external boundary can be calculated along the same line. for the local coordinate
one can choose the most symmetric combination of the two abelian dierentials,
since this boundary surrounds both loops

v i (0)1 = 1 + 2 .

(5.18)

the complete result will now be the combination of four regions, corresponding to
z1  b, b and z2  c, c. the four regions combine into a single integral, as for
the two contributions (5.13) and (5.15), and give the same result as eq. (5.13) with
t3 and t1 exchanged.

taking into account all boundaries, one gets a completely symmetric expression,
that should be further multiplied by a factor of two, since in all the computations
presented the role of z1 and z2 can be exchanged, as was discussed after eq. (2.2).
at this point one can perform the integration over t1, t2 and t3 independently,
introducing, a factor of 1/3! that cancels the factor of two coming from the z1  z2
symmetry, and the triple counting arising from the three dierent rst quantized

is simply

the expected result.

by using the identication among eld theory propagators and regions of inte-
gration, it is possible to derive also, in a similar way, the other irreducible twopoint
3 diagram in fig. (7). this diagram has dierent symmetries, which implies, in
eld theory, that its normalization diers from the one of eq. (5.19) by a factor of
two. without entering the details of the calculations, it is easy to see the string
origin of this dierence.
in fact, as should be clear from fig. 9, in this case it
is possible to consider two worldsheet congurations for each rst quantized dia-
gram, besides the usual exchange between the external legs z1 and z2; this fact is
eventually responsible for the dierent normalization. the result is

calculation can be simply determined by picking one of the various corners of in-
tegrations that are relevant for each diagram. all the other contributions only

27

transform the regions of integration into the expected ones. this step can also
be done by hand, by counting the number of congurations contributing to the
diagram, and dividing it by the factor of 1/3! needed to perform the integration
independently. however, if the symmetrization is carried out explicitly, it gives a
nontrivial check on the correctness of the result, that can be useful when computing
more complicated amplitudes.

we turn very briey to the case of quartic interactions, by considering the
diagram in fig. 10. the simplest way to get the correct result for this diagram is

a

perhaps to use the technique that was briey mentioned in section 3, when the 4
matching was performed by inserting  functions for the proper times that must
vanish in order to obtain quartic vertices. choosing for example the boundary

[a, a] in fig. 6, one sees that the punctures must be integrated between 1/k1
and k1. after splitting the integration region into eld theory propagators,
as was done to obtain the 3 diagrams, we can simply insert the appropriate 
functions, say ((tz1  t2)/), with strength 1/2 since they are all located at the
boundaries of the integration regions. four ways of inserting two such  functions
yield an overall actor of unity. including the other boundaries in the same way to
complete the integration region yields

duce.

5.3 fourpoint amplitudes

as a last nontrivial check of our technique for 3 amplitudes, we have computed
the twoloop fourpoint diagram depicted in fig. 11. to extract this diagram from
the general expression of the string master formula eq. (2.1), we can proceed in
two steps: rst, since we are interested in an irreducible conguration, we have to
consider the limit 1  0 and introduce the change of variables eq. (5.10), which

28

1

generates the structure of the irreducible two-loop vacuum bubble; then we have to
consider all possible ways of inserting the four punctures. two conditions must be
respected: the cyclic order is xed, say to (1, 2, 3, 4), and the pairs of external legs
(4, 1) and (2, 3) must attach to dierent propagators. for example, considering the
boundary corresponding to the interval [a, a] in fig. 6, we can place 1 and 2 inside
the interval [1,1] and 2 and 3 outside, or viceversa. similar reasonings apply
to the other two boundaries. thus, introducing proper times for all the zi variables
and summing up all the contributions, we obtain the expression

where the functions ga and gc have been dened in eqs. (5.14) and (5.21) respec-
tively. this result is exactly the leading color term of the eld theory diagram of
fig. 11, as expected.

6 concluding remarks

in this paper we analyze in detail the method to dene and compute eld theory
limits of string amplitudes and study in particular the case of scalar states. concep-
tually, the target eld theory is identied by isolating in the string amplitude the
quantities that have to be kept xed when  goes to zero. this step is essentially
determined by looking at the simplest diagram, as was done in section 3; in this
way one can establish a mapping between gs and the coupling constant of the eld
theory one wants to reproduce. having done this, it is possible to introduce imme-
diately the dimensional schwinger parameters ti which measure the length of the
various propagators in units of . this operation absorbs the residual dependence

29

on the string tension contained in the overall normalization, so that it becomes
possible to take the limit   0, keeping the eld coupling constant and proper
times ti xed. the mapping between string logarithms and schwinger parameters
is usually rather intuitive. as was stressed through the various calculations, it is
quite easy to follow, from a geometrical point of view, how the string worldsheet
degenerates into a graph and how to relate each corner of the integration region to
a specic feynman diagram.

in all our calculations, we have always found a precise matching between the
string results and the eld theory feynman diagrams. we think that this work
shows that string techniques are by now mature, and can be condently used to
simplify the computation of many quantities in eld theory. the results obtained in
this way can be rmly trusted; in fact, the derivation of the combinatorial factors is
easier and the tedious algebra of color decomposition is avoided. moreover, during
the calculation itself, one has the possibility to perform novel consistency checks.
for instance, in twoloop calculations one has to obtain the same result from very
dierent regions of the string moduli space. we have shown that this is necessary
in order to reconstruct the region of integration over the schwinger proper times
that is expected from eld theory.

the generalization of this approach to the physically interesting case of yang
mills theory is, of course, computationally more demanding. one has to deal with
derivatives of the green function, and all stringy quantities have to be expanded
up to rst order in the multipliers, since the spin1 particle is not the ground
state of the bosonic theory. furthermore, besides this technical problem, there is
also a conceptual dierence. as we discussed, the three twoloop moduli k1, k2
and  are on the same footing from the eld theory point of view; in fact, they
are all associated to 3 propagators. their role in the schottky parametrization
is, however, quite dierent, since only the ks are really multipliers, while  is a
xed point. this asymmetry is not evident in the study of 3 diagrams and one
obtains directly from the string expression the correct results, with the expected
eld theory symmetry. for instance, eq. (5.20) is invariant under the exchange
of t1 and t3. however, it is already clear from the study of yangmills vacuum
bubbles [22], that the dierent origin of the various parameters in the schottky
description plays a nontrivial role in this more complicated case. we think that
the study of the worldsheet geometry will provide other useful information for the
derivation of pure glue amplitudes from the string master formula, and we hope
that our analysis is a further step in this direction.

appendix

we collect in this appendix the feynman rules for the scalar theories we are
considering, our conventions and several useful formulas concerning the computation
of color factors.

the feynman rule for the cubic scalar vertex described by the lagrangian in

eq. (3.6) is simply

v = i g3 d

,

(a.1)

where d is the completely symmetric u(n) color tensor, described below. simi-
larly, for the quartic interaction in eq. (3.15), the rule is

v = i g4(cid:16)dd

 + dd

 + dd

(cid:17) .

(a.2)

notice that in eld theory we use the standard metric (+,,,), whereas string
theory is naturally formulated in the metric with opposite sign.
to derive the u(n) color algebra, it is useful to start from su(n) matrices, and
then complement them with the diagonal u(1) generator. in the following we will
denote u(n) indices with greek letters, {, , . . .}, and su(n) indices with latin
ones, {a, b, . . .}, so that, say,  = {0, a} if we assign the value 0 to the u(1) index.
throughout the paper, most of the calculations have been performed with external
particles restricted to the su(n) subgroup, unless explicitly stated. we normalize
our generators as

tr () =

with this normalization, the su(n) generators satisfy

to promote the above equations to u(n) we must add a correctly normalized u(1)
generator, which can be taken proportional to the identity matrix,

the anticommutation relations for the u(n) generators can then be summarized

note that this implies d0 = q 2

one can generalize eqs. (a.4) and (a.5) to

it is worth noticing however that eq. (a.10) does not smoothly generalize to the
case in which one or more of the external indices take their values in the u(1)
subgroup. for example one nds

finally, a useful formula to connect between standard feynman rules and color
ordered ones is

the analogous formula for the structure constants fabc serves the same purpose in
qcd.
