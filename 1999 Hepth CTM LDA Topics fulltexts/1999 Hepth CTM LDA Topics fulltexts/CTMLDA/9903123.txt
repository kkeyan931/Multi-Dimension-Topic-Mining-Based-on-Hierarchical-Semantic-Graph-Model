duality relates two models radically dierent perturba- tive expansions spectra. secondly, analysis web string dualities shows may derived combining t-duality . duality conjecture so(32) heterotic string type theory basically relies uniqueness corresponding supergravity models. fact, two tree-level eective actions turn related {$9510169$} eld redenition inverts coupling constant. duality thus identies weak coupling regime one theory strong coupling regime other. rst check conjecture, shown {$9511053$} world- volume theory d-string type identical world-sheet theory heterotic string. particular explains appearance so(32) spinor representation type theory. evidence conjectured duality given literature, mainly relying existence bps states. well known, bps states form short (or ultra-short) multiplets supersymmetry algebra mass related charge. fact stable protected radiative corrections. hence, properties analysed computed perturbatively weak coupling reliably extrapolated strong coupling. tests heterotic/type duality conjecture comprise comparison bps spectra compactied theories {$9801128$}, also bps saturated terms eective actions uncompactied {$9510173$} compactied cases . however, rst massive level heterotic string contains perturbative states stable bps. stability follows fact lightest states carrying quantum numbers spinor representation so(32). since cannot decay, states present also strong coupling regime. then, heterotic/type duality correct, type theory support non-perturbative stable congurations spinors so(32). finding checking multiplicities therefore non-trivial test heterotic/type duality. turns {$9808141$} pair formed d1-brane anti d1-brane type (wrapped circle z2 wilson line) describes conguration quantum numbers spinor representation so(32) (for reviews see {$9904207$}). thus system right candidate describe non-perturbative regime stable non-bps states heterotic string mentioned above. however, superposition brane anti-brane unstable due presence 1 tachyons open strings stretching brane anti-brane {$9511194$}. problem dening properly superposition treating tachyon instability arises. addressed a. sen remarkable series

thinks type iib dp-branes p odd. however, one keep mind d-particle non-supersymmetric non-bps conguration. furthermore unstable, due fact tachyons spectrum open strings living world-line. tachyons turn odd world-sheet parity , hence disappear one performs projection get type string {$9510169$}. therefore, d-particle found sen stable non-perturbative conguration type transforms spinor so(32). paper analyze type d-particle point view closed string operator formalism, construct representation terms boundary state . boundary state approach convenient useful method describe bps d-branes, nd couplings various closed string elds {$9510169$} also determine interactions (for applications boundary state see example refs. ). refs. , shown boundary state formalism also applied successfully describe non-bps congurations certain orbifold models. here, use approach study superposition d-string anti d-string type iib theory, construct corresponding boundary state proper normalization. then, extending sens arguments, manage incorporate eects tachyon condensation directly boundary state, show explicitly particular value tachyon v.e.v. boundary state describes non-bps d-particle. moreover, show result achieved means suitable discrete transformation eectively accounts tachyon condensation initial d-string anti d-string pair. using construction also compute directly mass non-bps d-particle nding agreement sens result. closed string operator formalism, projection reduces type iib type implemented adding boundary state type ii crosscap state  uniquely determined requirement tadpole cancellation. way one obtains eective boundary state type 2 d-branes eciently used study properties interactions. applying procedure non-bps d-particle, construct corresponding boundary state
