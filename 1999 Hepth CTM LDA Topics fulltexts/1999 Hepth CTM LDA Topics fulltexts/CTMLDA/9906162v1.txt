abstract

by analysing supersymmetry transformations we derive new bps equations for the d=11

vebrane propagating in at space that involve the world-volume three-form. the equa-

tions generalise those of 2,3,4 and 5 dimensional special lagrangian submanifolds and

are relevant for describing membranes ending on these submanifolds.

1 introduction

the world-volume theories of branes in string theory and m-theory are an interesting

setting for studying bps equations. one notable feature is that the solutions incorpo-

rate a spacetime interpretation [1, 2, 3] which arises from the fact that the scalar elds

describe the embedding of the brane in a target space. the world-volume theory of the

d=11 vebrane, for example, has a bps self-dual string soliton that preserves 1/2 of

the world-volume supersymmetry, or equivalently, 1/4 of the spacetime supersymmetry

[3]. it is charged with respect to the world-volume self-dual three-form and one scalar

eld is excited that is harmonic in four variables. the simplest solution with a single

centre can then be visualised as a semi-innite membrane ending on the vebrane. this

conguration can be represented as

m5 : 1 2

3 4 5

m2 : 1

6

,

(1)

with the self-dual string lying in the 1 direction and the 6 direction corresponding to the

excited scalar eld.

here we will derive the bps equations corresponding to adding more membranes

to this conguration. specically, we will analyse congurations with 2,3,4 and 5 in-
tersecting membranes, lying in the {2, 7}, {3, 8}, {4, 9} and {5, 10} directions, which
preserve 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 and 1/32 of the spacetime supersymmetry, respectively. the

bps equations are obtained by analysing the supersymmetry transformations of the ve-

brane world-volume theory in a at target space. each membrane in the conguration of

intersecting branes suggests which projections to impose on the supersymmetry parame-

ters and in addition which scalar elds should be active. this information then leads to

the bps equations.

we will argue that the equations are appropriate for describing a membrane ending

on a vebrane world-volume some of which is a special lagrangian submanifold. to see

this we note that a consequence of the projections is that one can add vebranes for

free, i.e., without breaking further supersymmetry. following [4, 5], it was shown in [6]

(see also [7, 8]) that a conguration of intersecting vebranes gives rise to bps equations

on the world-volume of a single vebrane that imply that the vebrane world-volume

1

(or part of it) is a calibrated submanifold [9]. by adding extra membranes to (1) we

nd that the vebranes we can add for free correspond to the special lagrangian calibra-

tions. more precisely, adding 2,3,4 and 5 membranes corresponds to the projections for

vebranes related to 2,3,4 and 5 dimensional special lagrangian manifolds, respectively.

the full bps equations will involve the world-volume three-form and can be interpreted

as membranes ending on such vebrane world-volumes1. it should be emphasised that

since the bps equations incorporate back reaction, the vebrane world-volume will in

general no longer be special lagrangian. both the geometry and the topology could be

dierent.

let us illustrate this interpretation further for the simplest case. adding a membrane
in the {2, 7} directions to (1) implies that we can add an anti-vebrane in the {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
directions for free to obtain:

m5 :

1 2 3

4 5

m2 :

1

m2 :

m5 :

2

4 5 6

.

(2)

the two intersecting vebranes alone correspond to a two-dimensional special lagrangian
submanifold, or equivalently, a complex curve in the {1, 2, 6, 7} directions. this is the
m-theory setup that has been used to analyse n = 2 superyang-mills (sym) theory

[11]. by including the membranes, the corresponding bps equations will have solutions

that can be interpreted as a membrane ending on this curve. in the yang-mills setting

these congurations will correspond to monopoles and dyons. such membranes were rst

considered in [12, 13, 14] without including the back-reaction on the vebrane. the bps

equations that we discuss here which do include the back-reaction were rst presented in

[10, 15] and the application to dyons was analysed in [15]. in [10, 15] the bps equations

were derived and checked in a certain approximation in the covariant formalism of

the vebrane [16]. here we shall derive the exact bps equations in the hamiltonian

formalism [17]. a consequence of this is that we will be able to present the exact energy

functional for these congurations that was presented in approximate form in [19].

1note that bps equations for other congurations of intersecting vebranes and membranes were

derived in [10].

2

after discussing this case we will consider three intersecting membranes. we will

see that the projections for the membranes imply the projections corresponding to a

three dimensional special lagrangian submanifold. such submanifolds are relevant for

describing n=2 sym in d=3 [20] and the equations for the membranes correspond to

solitonic excitations in these theories. the bps equations that we derive provide a

starting point to analyse such states.

the projections for four intersecting membranes automatically imply those for ve so

we will consider these cases together. the resulting bps equations are appropriate for

studying membranes ending on four or ve dimensional special lagrangian submanifolds.

the bps equations for the ve membrane case are in fact the most general in the sense

that by setting certain scalar elds to zero we can recover the bps equations for all

previous cases. in all cases the equations are rather complicated and (almost) no attempt

will be made for nding solutions here.

2 two intersecting membranes

to derive the bps equations we will use the hamiltonian formalism of the vebrane

theory [17] which is derived from the lagrangian formalism of [18]. the bosonic world

volume elds consist of scalars x ,  = 0, . . . , 10, and a closed three form eld-strength

h that satises a self-duality condition. in the static gauge we have x 0 = 0, x a = a,

a = 1, . . . , 5, where (0, a) are coordinates on the vebrane world-volume. we will only

consider static, bosonic congurations2 x t (a), t = 6, . . . , 10, habc(a), and we shall

take a at target space. the spatial components of the world-volume metric, gab, are

then given by

gab = ab + ax t bx t .

(3)

it was shown in [10] that bosonic congurations that preserve supersymmetry must

satisfy

qdet(g + h)ab = 0" 1

5!

a1...a5a1...a5 

g
2

ab h ab + ata#  ,

(4)

2in the hamiltonian formalism we only need to specify the spatial components of h.

3

where

h ab =

tf =

abc1c2c3hc1c2c3 ,

1
g
abcdehabchdef ,

1
3!
1
4!

(5)

and  is a 32 component majorana spinor satisfying  = 1. we use the convention that
12345 = 1. the gamma-matrices a are the at spacetime matrices, a, pulled back to

the world-volume:

a = a + ax t t .

it is useful to introduce the density

hab = g h ab

(6)

(7)

so that the closure of the three-form h is then a hab = 0.

we now turn to the congurations of two membranes intersecting a vebrane ac-

cording to the pattern (2). to preserve supersymmetry we must impose the following

projections on the supersymmetry parameters:

012345 = 

016 = 

027 = 

(8)

and hence the conguration preserves 1/8 of the supersymmetry. these projections
imply that 034567 =  which means that we can indeed include the nal vebrane in
(2) for free, as claimed earlier. to realise this conguration of intersecting branes as a

supersymmetric conguration of the rst vebrane we set all scalar elds to zero except
for x 6  y 1 and x 7  y 2, which will be functions of a = (i, ), i = 1, 2,  = 3, 4, 5.
by substituting this ansatz into (4) and imposing the projections (8) we will be able to

derive the bps equations.

it will be convenient to introduce the notation (1, 2)=(6, 7), so that projections

on the spinor imply that

11 = 22 = 12345

12 = 21 .

4

(9)

we then nd that

12345 = [(1  det iy j)12345 + iy i + iy jij12 + y ii
+ (y jjy i  y ijy j)i + y 1y 2] .

(10)

similarly

habab = [( h12ijiy j + hiy i)12345 + (y k hiiy lkl  h12(1  det iy j))12
(11)

 hii  hjjy ii + ( h12iy i  h[iy j]ij)21  h]

1
2



and

taa = taa + taay ii .

(12)

to ensure the equality of the two sides of (4) the sum of (10-12) must vanish expect

for terms proportional to 12345. we conclude that

h = 0
hi = y i
h12 =
iy i = 0 .

ijiy j + y ky iiy lkl

1  det iy j

(13)

the rst equation comes from noting that  =  + . . . and ensuring that the 

terms vanish. the next three equations follow from the vanishing of the terms i, 12

and , respectively. using these it is straightforward to show that the i and 21

terms also vanish. these equations also imply that

t = y 1y 2
ti = 0 .

(14)

from the functional form of gab we then conclude that ta = gabtb = ta. these facts then

ensure the vanishing of the , i and i terms.

to match the two sides of (4) we are thus left to show that

qdet(g + h) = 1  det iy j + y iy i + h12(1y 2  2y 1) .

(15)

5

we rst note that the determinant can be rewritten

det(gab + hab) = g +

1
2

hab hab + gabtatb .

and using (14) we have

gabtatb = (y 1  y 2)2 ,

(16)

(17)

where  = (3, 4, 5). we can then use mathematica to show using (13) that (15) is
indeed an identity. the closure of h imposes one additional equation:

y i = ijj h12

(18)

in summary, we have shown that (13), (18) are the relevant bps equations corre-

sponding to the conguration of intersecting branes in (2), and that the solutions will

preserve 1/8 of the spacetime supersymmetry. these bps equations were rst presented

in [10, 15] using the covariant formalism of the vebrane [16]. the preservation of super-

symmetry was checked up to terms quadratic in the spatial derivatives . by contrast

here we have checked the supersymmetry in the hamiltonian formalism exactly.

the form of h1 in the bps equations is somewhat analogous to that of a membrane
in the {0, 1, 6} directions and h2 that of a membrane in the {0, 2, 7} directions. more
specically, if we set y 2 = 0, say, then we precisely obtain the bps equations for a

single self-dual string in the 1 direction. alternatively, if one sets  = 0 and imposes
1y 2 = 2y 1 we get h = 0 and combined with the last equation in (13) we are left
with the cauchy-riemann equations for y 1, y 2 as a function of 1, 2, corresponding

to the two intersecting vebranes. we thus conclude that the equations generalise the

cauchy-riemann equations to include a non-zero h and thus are relevant for describing

membranes ending on complex curves in four dimensions, or equivalently, a two dimen-

sional special lagrangian submanifold. as the equations include the back-reaction of

the membrane on the vebrane geometry, the vebrane world-volume will in general no
longer be a complex curve in the {1, 2, 6, 7} directions because only half of the cauchy-
riemann equations are imposed. note that one can impose 1y 2 = 2y 1 and still have
non-zero h if  6= 0. these equations are somewhat simpler, but it was shown in [15]
that they do not admit nite energy solutions, and hence only provide an asymptotic

description of the dyons in n=2 sym theory. finally, if one imposes i = 0 we obtain

6

the bps equations for the delocalised intersecting self-dual strings discussed in [6] and

[22].

we conclude this section with a comment about the energy of solutions solving (13).

it was shown in [21] that the energy density squared of static vebrane congurations is

given by

e 2 = det(gab + hab) + tatbmab ,

(19)

with mab = abgab. for the congurations we have been considering we have tatbmab = 0
and hence

e = qdet(gab + hab)
1  det iy j

det g  (y 1  y 2)2

=

.

(20)

this last expression diers from that given in [19] but agrees with it up to terms quadratic

in the spatial derivatives which was the approximation employed there. note that if we
impose the other cauchy-riemann equation on y 1 and y 2, 1y 2 = 2y 1, we obtain

e = 1 + jy ijy i + y iy i

(21)

as in [19].

3 three intersecting membranes

we now consider adding another membrane to the conguration (2) to obtain

m5 : 1

2 3 4

5

m2 : 1

m2 :

m2 :

2

3

.

(22)

to preserve supersymmetry we must now impose 038 =  in addition to (8). this

means that the conguration preserves 1/16 of the spacetime supersymmetry.
denote (6, 7, 8)  (1, 2, 3) then we have

if we

ii = 11 = 12345
ij = ji

i 6= j ,

no sum on i

7

(23)

where i, j = 1, 2, 3. as in the previous section these projections imply that we can add

several other vebranes for free. in fact one nds we can add the vebranes corresponding

to three dimensional special lagrangian submanifolds (see section 2.2 of [6]).

to realise the intersection of such membranes and vebranes on the rst vebrane we
let three scalars be active: (x 6, x 7, x 8)  (y 1, y 2, y 3) with y i = y i(j, ), where in
this section i = 1, 2, 3 and  = 4, 5. as before we substitute this into (4) and impose the
projections to determine h. the vanishing of the terms with , , i and ij imply,
respectively, that

iy i = det(iy j)
h = 0
hi = mijy j
hij = ijkak
al = (iy j + y my imy j)ijkm 1
kl

where the matrix m is dened as

mij = ij  det

i|j

(ky l)

(24)

(25)

where the subscript on the deti|j indicates that we remove the ith row and jth column of
the matrix ky l before taking the determinant. it is then straightforward to show that

the i and [ij] terms automatically vanish using the lemmas

hiiy j = y iiy j  y j(ly l)
mijkyj = ky i  (ly l)ik

one can use mathematica to show that (24) implies

1
2

y iy jijk

tk = 
t = y ijy kijk

and hence the vanishing of the k and  terms. by expanding the identity

y [iy jky l] = 0

8

(26)

(27)

(28)

one can then show that

tiiy l + ty l = 

1
2

y iy jijkky l

(29)

and hence the i terms vanish. to complete the proof of supersymmetry one is then left

to prove that

qdet(g + h) = 1 

1
2

(iy i)2 +

1
2

iy jjy i + hiy i + hijiy j

(30)

this can again be established using mathematica. the closure of the three form h then

implies that

 hj + i hij = 0 .

(31)

the other equation, a ha = 0, is automatically satised by virtue of (24).

let us discuss some special cases of these equations. firstly we note that if we impose

(32)
then we have h = 0 and the equations are simply those of a three dimensional special
lagrangian submanifold [9]. the more general equations can thus be seen to include

iy j = jy i ,

y i = 0

cases relevant for describing membranes ending on such submanifolds. note that we can

just impose the rst equation in (32) leading to the equations for a three dimensional

special lagrangian manifold with non-zero three-form. by analogy with the case of two

intersecting membranes one is lead to suspect that this simplication will not admit nite

energy solutions.

we next consider the case where y i is a function of  only. in this case the self-dual

strings are delocalised in the i directions. in this case we nd

hi = y i
hij = h = 0

(33)

and the closure of h then implies that the y i are harmonic functions of two variables.

the solutions of these delocalised membranes then have a logarithmic behaviour. note

that the energy of these solutions is

finally, if we set y 3 = 0 then the equations become exactly those of the last section

e = 1 + y iy i .

(34)

corresponding to two intersecting self-dual strings.

9

4 four and five intersecting membranes

the projections imposed on the spinor parameters for the case of four intersecting mem-

branes with a vebrane automatically imply the projections for a fth membrane so we

shall analyse these cases together. the general conguration can be written

(35)

where  represents the number 10. in addition to (8) we must impose 038 = , 049 = 

05 = . we then have:

aa = 11 = 12345
ab = ba

a 6= b

no sum on a

(36)

where (1, . . . , 5)(6, . . . , ) and a, b = 1, . . . , 5. these projections are those for ve
dimensional special lagrangian submanifolds; the corresponding vebranes that one can

add to (35) for free can be found in section 2.4 of [6]. for this case all ve scalar
elds (x 6, . . . , x )(y 1, . . . , y 5) are excited. again we substitute into (4) and demand
equality. the right hand side of (4) becomes

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

which comes from the identity [aybcydeyf ] = 0, we conclude from (43) that the 0a

terms also vanish.

we have thus shown that solutions to the bps equations (38) and (41) together with

the closure of h, a hab = 0, preserve 1/32 of the supersymmetry provided that

we have not quite been able to show this with mathematica using the machines available.

however, we have made some highly non-trivial checks and we strongly expect that it is

in fact true.

note that if ay b = by a we have hab = 0 and the bps equations truncate to those of
a ve dimensional special lagrangian submanifold [9]. we note also that setting y 5 = 0

11

will give rise to the bps equations for four intersecting membranes associated with a

four dimensional special lagrangian submanifold, while if in addition we set y 4 = 0 we

recover the equations obtained in the last section. thus, these bps equations are the

most general of the type considered in this paper.

5 conclusions

we have constructed bps equations corresponding to membranes ending on vebranes

and revealed how they generalise those of special lagrangian submanifolds. the only

new solutions that were presented here were those corresponding to three delocalised

intersecting membranes. it would be very interesting to construct less trivial solutions,

but the analysis presented in [15] for two intersecting membranes indicates that this could

be very dicult.

if we dimensionally reduce the general conguration (35) on one of the vebrane

directions then we obtain a d-4-brane intersecting a fundamental string with four d-

2-branes. by reducing the bps equations that we have derived one will obtain bps

equations for the abelian dirac-born-infeld theory relevant for these congurations. by

additional t- and s-duality transformations, one can in principle obtain bps equations

for many dierent congurations of intersecting branes. following [21] it was shown in

[23] that simpler bps equations for the abelian dirac-born-infeld theory have a natural

analogue for the non-abelian theory. presumably this will also be true for these more

complicated cases.
