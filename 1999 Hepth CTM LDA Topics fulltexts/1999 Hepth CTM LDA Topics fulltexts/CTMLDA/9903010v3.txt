abstract

in this note a simple calculation of one loop threshold corrections for the so(32)
heterotic string is performed. in particular the compactication on t 2 with a wilson line
breaking the gauge group to so(16)so(16) is considered. using heterotic type i duality,
these corrections can be related to quantities appearing in the quantum mechanics of type
i d0 particles.

1. introduction

the quantum mechanics of d0 branes and coming with it the question of existence

of bound states of d0 branes is important for various string dualities. m-theory/type iia

duality implies that there is a single bound state of n d0 branes for any n corresponding

to kaluza-klein modes on the m-theory circle [1]. the relevant index for the case of two

d0 branes was computed in [2],[3]. in this calculation the index is split into a bulk and

boundary term which in turn is expressed as a zero dimensional matrix integral, whose

value for arbitrary n was conjectured in [4] using results from [5]. the bulk term of the

index was calculated directly in [6] using methods of topological eld theory.

another interesting example of quantum mechanics of d0 particles appears in the
so called type i theory, which describes d0 particles in the presence of d8 branes and
orientifold o8 planes [7][8][9][10]. this theory is important for the matrix theory formu-
lation of the heterotic string [11][12][13][14][15]. type i string theory is dened as the
iia orientifold on s1/z2 which is t-dual to type i theory. there are two orientifold eight
planes at the two ends of the interval and sixteen d8 branes in between. if eight d8 branes
are on top of each orientifold plane, the gauge symmetry is given by so(16)  so(16).
the strong coupling limit of this system is given by m-theory on s1/z2 [16]. the states
which are not present in perturbative type i spectrum, but which are needed to ll out
the e8  e8 multiplets, are given by bound states of d0-particles [17][18]. hence we have
to look for bound states of d0-particles transforming in the 128 and 120 of so(16).

it is interesting to nd the description of these states in the heterotic so(32) theory
where they are perturbatively realized. these states are bps states with nr = 0(1/2) for
the r(ns) sector. the mass and level matching [10][17][19] conditions become

here y is a wilson line along s1 and p are momenta in so(32) lattice and m and n
are the momentum and the winding along s1 respectively. with a wilson line given by
y = (08, (1/2)8), so(32) is broken to so(16)  so(16) and the analysis in [17] shows
that the states with nl = 0 and even n lie in the (120, 1) + (1, 120) of so(16)  so(16)
whereas the states with odd n lie in (128, 1) + (1, 128)

2. heterotic one loop thresholds

the duality of the so(32) heterotic and type i strings in ten dimensions makes it

possible to calculate some nonperturbative eects on the type i side due to euclidean d-

branes exactly by a one loop calculation on the heterotic side. the simplest case in which
such a calculation is possible arises for the heterotic string compactied on a two torus t 2
[20][21][22][23][24]. worldsheet instantons on the heterotic side get mapped to wrapped

euclidean d-branes on the torus, which provide d-instanton eects in eight dimensions.

there are one loop heterotic thresholds [25][26] which are bps-saturated and related

by supersymmetry to anomaly canceling terms [27] and therefore presumably exact at one

loop. the one loop integrals involved are almost holomorphic since only bps-states run in

the loop and hence the loop integrals can be calculated exactly. for the so(32) heterotic

string the relevant loop amplitude for gravitational thresholds with wilson lines is given

by

id = n (2)dzf

3. two torus compactication with wilson lines

we are interested in the t 2 compactication with the kahler and complex struc-
ture modulus t, u . the so(32) gauge symmetry will be broken to so(16)  so(16) by
introducing wilson lines on the two torus of the following form

y 1
i = (08, 1
2

), y 2

i = (08, 08).

(3.1)

2

this choice of wilson lines corresponds in the type i picture to eight d8 branes sitting on
top of each of the two o8 planes, canceling dilaton and ramond-ramond sources locally.
we want to calculate the one loop thresholds of the form t8tr(r4), t8tr(f 4)1 and
t8(tr(f 2)1)2 in the presence of this wilson line. the subscript on the eld strength in the
second and third term indicates that the trace is taken over the rst so(16) factor. the
integrals that will appear in this calculations are of the following form

(3.4)

(3.5)

the form of the operator q in (3.2) depends on the threshold in question. for gravitational
thresholds t8tr(r4) and t8(tr(r2))2 q is independent of the spin structures and a in (3.4)
and is given by (2.3).

the operator q for tr(f 4) and (tr(f 2))2 can be found by gauging (3.4)[25]. the
wilson line (3.1) breaks the gauge group to so(16)  so(16) and the thirty two free
fermions of the so(32) lattice are split into two sets of sixteen in (3.4). the result depends
on the spin structures [a, b] for the sixteen fermions which are associated with the rst
so(16) in (3.4). for the tr(f 4) threshold the operators are given by

qtr(f 4)(cid:20) 1
qtr(f 4)(cid:20) 0
qtr(f 4)(cid:20) 0

0(cid:21) ( ) =

4. evaluation of integral

the integral (3.2) can be evaluated using the method of orbits [28]. in the present

context this technique was discussed in [20][21] and in [22], where type i thresholds with

certain wilson lines present were evaluated using results from [29]. without wilson lines

it is straightforward to show that under the modular sl(2, z) transformations  = (a +
b)/(c + d) with a, b, c, d  z,ad  bc = 1

1

2(cid:12)(cid:12)(1u )a(cid:18)

=

d(cid:19)(cid:18) 
1(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)

c

2

.

(4.1)

the summation over all integer matrices matrices a can then replaced by the summation

over all equivalence classes of sl(2, z) orbits. there are three dierent cases, the trivial
orbit a = 0, the degenerate orbit det(a) = 0 and the non degenerate orbit det(a) 6= 0

in the following we will consider only the non degenerate orbit, where the fundamen-
tal f is unfolded into the double cover of the upper half plane h. the non degenerate
sl(2, z) orbits fall into the following equivalence classes

a = (cid:18) k

0

j

p(cid:19) ,

k > 0, 0  j < k, p  z.

(4.2)

when wilson lines are present, matters are more complicated but using the well known
transformation properties of the theta functions under    + 1,   1/ is is easy to

4

see that for both qtr(f )4 (3.6) and q(tr(f )2)2 (3.7), qc(y, a) dened in (3.4) behaves in
the following way

qc(y, a)(

a + b
c + d

) = qc(y, a(cid:18) a b

d(cid:19))( ).

c

(4.3)

hence the method of orbits can be used to unfold the integral. for the non degenerate

orbit we get

(4.4)

in order to evaluate (4.4) it is convenient to split the summation over equivalence classes
a in (4.2) into four seperate sectors a(i), i = 1,    , 4.

0

a(1) = (cid:18) 2k 2j
p (cid:19) ,
a(2) = (cid:18) 2k + 1 2j
p (cid:19) ,
a(3) = (cid:18) 2k 2j + 1
p (cid:19) ,
a(4) = (cid:18) 2k + 1 2j + 1

0

0

0  2j < 2k,
0  2j < 2k + 1,
0  2j + 1 < 2k,

(4.5)

p (cid:19) 0  2j + 1 < 2k + 1.

the expansion of qc(y, a(i)) appearing in (4.4) in powers of q = exp(2i ) and powers
of 1/2 is given by

qc(y, a(i))( ) = xn1,r0

c(i)
n,r

1
 r
2

qn.

(4.6)

the integral (4.4) is then of the form in,r dened in appendix. such integrals were evalu-
ated in [20][21] and the main results are reviewed in the appendix for completeness.

the terms of order 1/q in (4.6) are problematic for the type i interpretation as
discussed in section 6. for all qc(a(i)) which will be considered later it turns out that
only the a(1) and a(3) sector contribute terms of order 1/q in the integral. in addition
we shall nd that c(1)
1,r. in this case the summation over j of the two terms can
be combined giving p0j<2k exp(j/k) = 0 and hence these contribution vanish when

1,r = c(3)

summed over j.

in section 6 only terms of order q0 in (4.6) will directly related to quantities in type i
qm, which corresponds to taking the limit u2  . for these terms the nonholomorphic
pieces in the (tr(f 2))2 and (tr(r2))2 due to the presence of e2 will not supressed by inverse
powers of u2 in the u2   limit as explained in the appendix.

using (a.5) the i0,0 part of the integral (4.4) can be expressed as,

i0,0 = xk,p nc(1)

in all examples considered below we nd that c(2)
a(2) and a(4) sector can be combined, rearranging the summation gives

0,0 = c(4)

more one nds c(1)
0,0 = 232/26325. plugging

5. type i quantum mechanics

in order to determine the existence of bound states of d0 branes an index of the d0

brane qm has to be computed. in the case of type iia d0 branes in ten dimensions this

was done for the case of two d0 branes in [2],[3]. in this calculation the index is split into a

bulk and boundary term which in turn is expressed as a zero dimensional matrix integral.
the hamiltonian for the (0, 8) quantum mechanics governing d0-particles in type i

is given by (in the gauge a0 = 0 and following the notation of [9])

h =

tr(cid:16)2

(5.1)

all elds but the  are given by an orientifold projection of the su (n ) d0-particle quan-

tum mechanics, where xi and  transform as the traceless symmetric representation of
so(n ) which is given by the real matrices of the lie algebra of su (n ). the spinor 
transforms as 8c spinor of so(8) realated to the supersymmetries of the d0 brane unbro-
ken by the presence of the d8 brane. in addition we have the trace part xi and  which
are singlets under so(n ) and do not enter in the interacting hamiltonian (5.1).  and

  transform under the adjoint representation of so(n ) which is given by the imaginary
elements of su (n ) and transform as 1 and 8s of so(8) respectively. the chiral fermions
i
i transform in the real (8, 2n ) of so(8)  so(2n ). giving nonzero values to the pa-
rameters mij corresponds to moving the d8 branes away from the orientifold planes. the
index calculated below will in principle depend on the values of the parameters mij . in
the following we will mostly be interested the case of all mij = 0 in the hamiltonian. the

gauss constraint is given by

g = [j, xj]  [, ] + i  i   + ii t
i .

the index of qm is given by

in = lim


tr(1)f eh ,

(5.2)

(5.3)

where the trace is taken over gauge invariant states which satisfy g = 0. an integration

by parts turns the index into a bulk zn and decit term in , where i = zn + in and
the bulk term is given by

zn = lim

tr(1)f eh.

(5.4)

6. type i interpretation

we want to use the results for the heterotic thresholds to determine matrix integrals
of d0 particles in type i quantum mechanics. for simplicity we will consider a square
torus with radii r1, r2 , the kahler and complex structure moduli are then given by

t = bns

12 + ir1r2, u = i

r2
r1

.

(6.1)

under heterotic type i duality the coupling constants, metric and ast eld are related by

het = 1/i , i ghet

 = gi

, bhet

 = bi

 .

(6.2)

under a t-duality along the rst circle type i gets mapped to type i, where the radii are
related by

ri

1 = 1/ri 

, r1i 

= i , brr,i

12 = arr,i 

2

.

(6.3)

hence the heterotic moduli t and u get mapped to

t = arr

2 + i

r2


, u = ir1r2.

(6.4)

in the type i variables the heterotic modulus t has the interpretation of the action of a
euclidean d0 brane worldline on a circle of radius r2. on the other hand the modulus u is
independent of the type i coupling constant and can be interpreted as the action of open
string worldsheet instantons which stretch between the two 8-brane/orientifold planes. in
the limit of innite separation of the 8-brane/orientifold planes r1   all contributions
of the form exp(2ku ) will therefore vanish for k > 0. for this limit to be meaninful it is

important that terms of order 1/q in the integral (4.4) do not contribute as mentioned in
section 4, since they will behave as exp(2u2) which diverges as u2  . note that the in
the limit u2   the two o8 planes eectively decouple. a calculation as in section 4 for a
t8tr(f1)2tr(f2)2 threshold, where the two traces are over the two dierent so(16), reveals
that there are no terms which survive the u2   limit. hence the traces involving only
one so(16) factor should be sensitive only to the qm of d0 particles on one o8 plane. the

situation for the gravitational threshold might be more complicated allthough the counting

of fermionic zero modes suggests that the thresholds are only related to d0-branes on one

of the two o8 planes. in the following we will identify exp(2in t ) term in the threshold

with the euclidean action for a worldline of a bound state of n d0 branes. the prefactor

of the threshold should then be related to the bulk partition function zn of the index for

9

n type i d0-particles. this is the same idea used in [4] for the iia d0 particle quantum

mechanics. for odd n the i0,0 calculated in (4.11),(4.14) and (4.16) are of the same form

and it is tempting to conjecture that the value of zn up to an n independent numerical

factor is given by

zn = constxn|n

1
n

, n odd.

(6.5)

the value of zn is determined up to an n independent constant which can in principle be

determined by a careful analysis of the relative normalization of the heterotic calculation
and the type i qm. on the other had for even n , i.e. n = 2n, the results for the

integrals i0,0 have a dierent structure than (6.5). the terms in i0,0 (4.11),(4.14) and
(4.16) proportional to exp(2i2nt ) are given by

with some constants c1 and c2 and it is natural to assume that the bulk part of the index

has the same structure, allthough it is at present not clear whether one can read o the

value of the constants from (6.6) directly.

a possible explanation for this behavior of the thresholds for even n could be that

the heterotic threshold corrections are not related directly to the bulk part of the index

but to some correlation function for the qm, which diers from the bulk index for 2n d0

particles but is proportional to it for odd number of d0 particles.

the elds entering the quantum mechanics also contain eight singlet bosons xi.i =
1,    , 8 and eight fermions a, a = 1,    8. the r4 threshold then corresponds to the loop

10

amplitude of a d0 brane coupling to four gravitons. the vertex operator for a graviton

with polarization ternsor hij coupling to the d0 branes is given by

v (h) = hij kkik

 x jeikx .

(6.10)

the insertions of the four graviton vertices soaks up the eight fermionic zero modes a.
the so(n ) part of the qm does not couple to these center of mass coordinates and
hence the r4 threshold should then be multiplied by a partition function of the so(n )

degrees of freedom which we interpret as the bulk term for the qm.

in the case of tr(f 4) and (tr(f 2))2, the situation is more complicated since the gauge

elds live on the d8 brane and there is a coupling between these and the so(n ) qm via
a
i . a vertex for a gauge eld with eld strength f ij
ij

for a d0 brane is of the form

v (f ) = f ij

ij ij

i

aj

a eikx .

(6.11)

hence a d0-brane loop coupling to four gauge elds will correspond to the insertion of

aj

four such vertex operators, which again soak up the eight  zero modes. the insertion
of i

a in the path integral of the so(n ) is equivalent to taking derivatives /mij of
zn in (5.4). the results of the heterotic threshold corrections predict these correlation
functions, if this interpretation is correct.

in particular the heterotic threshold calculation implies that there is a dierence between

the case n even and n odd for these correlation functions.

it would be interesting to

check this conjectured result explicitly.

7. d0-particle loop

there is a simple picture of the result for the bulk part of the index zn in (6.5). n
d0 particles will form bound states which transform (according to heterotic type i duality)

as the 128 of so(16) for odd n and as the 120 of so(16) for even n. one can imagine
that the d0 particles are stuck on the d8-o8 branes. the tr(f1)4 can then be interpreted
as coming from a loop of d0 particles with four graviton vertex operators (6.10) inserted.

where  is the mass of a d-particle. if the d-particle is stuck on the d8-brane the momen-

tum integral is nine dimensional, i.e. d = 9. furthermore inserting four vertices to soak
up fermionic zero modes introduces a factor of t4, i.e. k = 4 in (7.1). after integrating out

the loop momentum and performing a poisson resummation over n, we get

contribution of a charge n d0 particle winding m times givs

(7.3)

note that there is a dierences to the case of the iib d0 particle analysis given in [4]. due

to the fact that the momentum integral is only nine dimensional (since we assumed that the

d0 brane is stuck on the orientifold plane) the integral reduces to a bessel function k1/2
instead of k1. since the series expansion for k1/2 terminates after one term this implies
that there is no innite asymptotic series of corrections. this behavior should reect the
exact cancellation of bosonic and fermionic uctuations for the type i quantum mechanics.
note also that the extra contribution for the tr(f )4 and (tr(f 2))2 thresholds for n = 2n
could be interpreted as coming from n d0 particles with charge two. this might come
from d0 particle pairs which move pairwise o the d8 plane and form a bound state with

twice the charge.

8. conclusions

in this note a heterotic one loop calculation of threshold corrections in the presence of

wilson lines was performed. using the heterotic type i duality and the t-duality relating
type i and type i it was argued that from these thresholds information about certain
quantities calculated in type i quantum mechanics can be extracted. at the moment the

12

0,0

status of this claim is not certain. a puzzling feature is the dierence in the structure of
zn calculated in section 4 for even and odd number of d0 particles. in particular for the
gravitational threshold i tr(r4)
seems unlikely to be directly related to the bulk term for
even n . one (disappointing) possibility is that the quantities calculated in this note are not
directly related to the bulk terms of the index (or correlation functions) for type i qm. on
the other hand it would be very interesting to adress this question by a direct calculation
of in type i qm for arbitary n . this seems to be a very dicult task. another interesting
question would be to consider more general wilson lines than (3.1) corresponding to moving

the d8 branes o the orientifold planes [9][10]. in principle the calculation in this note

can easily be generalized to the more general case. in addition it is not clear wether the

part of the threshold which depend on exp(2iu ) have an interpretation in the d0-brane

quantum mechanics.

appendix a. evaluation of the integrals

in this appendix we review the evaluation of integrals appearing in the heterotic

threshold calculation. the basic technique was developed in [28] for more details in this

context see [20][21].

(a.4)

we are primarily interested in the evaluation of the integrals in the large u2 limit.
easy to see that the leading contribution in (a.3) is obtained when all the derivatives act
on the exponential in (a.3). since a = n2u2/(t2k2) + o(1) all the integrals i0,r will be
suppressed by factors of 1
for r > 0, because the leading term is proportional to n, which
u r

it is

vanishes for n = 0. the nal result for for the leading u2 independent term in i0,0 is the
given by

where in applications of this formula in section 4 the sumation range of j depends on the
