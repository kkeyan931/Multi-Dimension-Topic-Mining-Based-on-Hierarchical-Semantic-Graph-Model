(1)wf odd w anticommutes fermions green-schwarz formalism, fermions must antiperiodic sectors odd winding number. similarly, gso projection g |i = |i imply p2 must multiple 1/r2. looking (1.1) see two possibilities. either (1)f equal +1 p2 = n/r2 (1)f = 1 p2 = (n + 1/2)/r2. sectors p2r2 integer half-integer, integer p2r2 project fermions half-integer p2r2 project bosonic states. thus four kinds sectors; odd even w combined integer half-integer p2r2. even w boundary conditions untwisted theory odd values w must impose antiperiodic boundary conditions green-schwarz fermions . 2 since sectors even values w well-known (we keep bosons fermions according p2), note sectors odd values w ground state 8 (1/24 1/48) = 1/2 excitations left-moving right-moving sector (the ground state ns-ns sector rns formalism). words, ground state nondegenerate bosonic tachyon. must also take account condition l0 = l0, precisely (nl = nr = 0 ground state even w nl = nr = 1/2 odd w dene n = p2r2) (1.2) nl = nr + nw. furthermore integer n must project fermions spectrum. even w (which means also even nw) leaves us bosonic states untwisted iia theory. odd w (which implies integer nw) fermionic modes half-integers see due (1.2) number left-moving right-moving fermionic excitations must equal mod 2. therefore level matching condition (1.2) automatically projects fermionic states. similarly half-integer n must get rid bosonic states. w even, nw integer odd apart (1.2) must also independently impose condition (1)f = 1 get fermionic part spectrum type iia string theory. however w odd (which implies nw half-integer fermions antiperiodic), see mismatch 1/2 modulo 1 nl nr (1.2), bosons projected automatically result level-matching condition (1.2). cases saw (1)f projection automatic sectors odd values w. general property orbifolds twisted sectors trip around closed string equivalent symmetry g, gso projection g |i = |i direct consequence level-matching condition. tachyons? even values w part spectrum type iia strings, tachyon. however odd values w, nd tachyon. recall m2 = 4 nl + (cid:18) n r2 2 wr2 (cid:19) = 4 nr + (cid:18) n r2 + 2 wr2 (cid:19) .

however, large n analysis suggests scales like positive power n, another reason black hole interpretation seem viable. 5. conclusions make disasters? believe work solid evidence absence lorentz invariant vacuum m-theory based rohm com- pactication. rohm strings certainly degrees freedom matrix model, even cannot derive (apparently meaningless tachyon un- bounded eective potential) string perturbation expansion (as consequence absence nonrenormalization theorem). however, naive physical intuition based string perturbation series, suggest stable solution corresponding rohm model, lorentz invariant. cannot trust perturbative calculations detail, least imply vacuum energy system negative (hypothetical) stable minimum. (we remind reader even large radius, tachyon appears, potential calculated rohm negative system wants ow smaller 18 radius). perhaps nonsupersymmetric anti-desitter solution m-theory rohm model ows. many problems interpretation, since involves changing asymptotic boundary conditions generally covariant theory. normally one would imagine m-theory two dierent sets asymptotic boundary conditions breaks two dierent quantum mechanical systems simply talk other. nite energy states one set boundary conditions simply overlap nite energy states another (the denition energy completely dierent). aside note extremely interesting question arises systems (un- like rohm compactication) metastable minkowski vacuum. semiclassical approximation  one sometimes nd instantons represent tun- neling minkowski vacuum bubble anti-desitter space. idea make sense fully quantum mechanical theory, particularly one believes holographic principle? coleman de luccia argue system inside ads bubble unstable recollapse interpret disaster cosmic proportions: minkowski space lls bubbles, expanding speed light, interior becomes singular nite proper time. hard imagine scenario could described holographic framework3. rate, clear fate rohm compactication depends crucially sense one might argue change vacuum expectation values. attempt study light cone frame doomed start. notorious defect light cone approach nding correct vacuum extremely dicult. involves understanding cancelling large n divergences limiting dlcq, changing parameters light cone hamiltonian. correct vacuum nite distance away eld space naive vacuum one constructs original dlcq hamiltonian, may simply mean true hamiltonian little resemblance one one starts. physical arguments good guide, problem may even severe. correct vacuum may even light cone frame hamiltonian formulation. confess jumped technical details construction thinking physical arguments above. nonetheless, feel failure useful reminder gravitational physics dierent quantum eld theory, indication extreme delicacy susy breaking m-theory. 3this taken simply indication holographic description asymptotically spacetimes somehow sick. coleman de luccia instanton also exists asymptotically ads framework, two negative energy vacua. higher energy state small vacuum energy semiclassical analysis practically unchanged. so, coleman deluccia phenomenon really exists m-theory able nd framework studying within ads/cft. 19 acknowledgments work supported part doe grant number de-fg02-96er40559.
