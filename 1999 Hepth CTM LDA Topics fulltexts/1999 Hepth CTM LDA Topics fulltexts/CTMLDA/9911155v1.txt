we employ the dirac-like equation for the gauge
eld proposed by majorana to obtain an action that
is symmetric under duality transformation. we also
use the equivalence between duality and chiral sym-
metry in this fermion-like formulation to show how the
maxwell action can be seen as a mass term.

i. introduction

recently many papers have been published ex-
ploring the issue of electromagnetic duality. this
production has been motivated by the relation be-
tween duality symmetry and theories with strong
and weak coupling. another motivation has been
due to the presence of various duality symmetries
in the string theories, specically, the target space
duality (t-duality), which is the symmetry of the
low energy eective eld theory and the s-duality
(the generalization of the electric/magnetic dual-
ity) which is the invariance under the sl(2, r) du-
ality transformations of the equations of motion for
the bosonic sector of the heterotic string. besides
these, a very important interest resides in the elec-
trically and magnetically charged black holes in the
semiclassical view [1].

consequently, one of the rst dualities observed,
the electric-magnetic duality in maxwells equa-
tions, has received great attention. however, the
problem that arises in preserving the duality sym-
metry and, at the same time, the manifest lorentz
covariance when the duality is implemented is a
very dicult obstacle. the main objective in the
literature is to construct a duality symmetric ac-
tion being manifestly lorentz invariant.

schwarz and sen (ss) [2] proposed a dual invari-
ant action in which one more potential has been
introduced generalizing the t-duality symmetric

string action [3] to the case of the heterotic string.
however, this formulation is not manifestly covari-
ant. but it is classically and quantically poincare
invariant. one way to recover the manifest lorentz
invariance is producing a non-polynomial action,
but it dicults the quantization. an alternative
procedure is to use the hamiltonian formalism in
which, after the introduction of an innite set of
elds (this idea was rst used to analyze chiral
bosons [4,5]) it is possible to get suitable duality
conditions [6]. the corresponding action, in ten di-
mensions, containing an innite number of elds,
is manifestly invariant under electromagnetic du-
ality transformation after compactication to four
dimensions giving a local maxwell action with elec-
tric and magnetic sources [7].

in the approach of the source-free maxwell the-
ory in an arbitrary background geometry, the dual-
ity symmetry under general electric/magnetic eld
rotations can be implemented in a non-local way,
as was introduced by deser and teitelboim (dt)
[8], where if the manifest covariance is lost, we can
construct quadratic actions for these models.
it
can be proved that this formulation is equivalent to
the schwarz-sen ones [9] via path integral formal-
ism. in the reference [10] it was introduced sources
into these non-manifestly invariant actions. the
covariantization of this procedure has been accom-
plished in [11].

khoudeir and pantoja (kp) [12], getting back
the non-polynomial action scheme, suggested a
lorentz invariant version of the ss model intro-
ducing the concept of an auxiliary time-like con-
stant vector in the action. however, the constant
property of this vector in fact violates the manifest
covariance. pasti, sorokin and tonin (pst) [13],
making good use of this idea, proposed a gener-
alization of the dt, ss and kp duality symmet-
ric actions presenting the kp unit norm auxiliary
vector as a lorentz frame vector eld that can be
related to the gravitation interaction. the action
constructed is manifestly covariant.

in this work we use the fermion-like formulation
of e. majorana [14,15] for the maxwell theory to
construct an action that is invariant under rela-

tivistic and duality transformations. the paper is
organized as follows: in section 2 we make a review
of the work of majorana and obtained a dirac-like
expression for the maxwell equations in the ab-
sence of sources. this femion-like formulation sug-
gest us to explore the chiral aspects in the theory.
it is accomplished in section 3.
in section 4 we
prove that in this formulation, duality is a kind of
chirality and in this context we introduce our ac-
tion which is invariant under duality and obeys the
poincare algebra on-shell. finally, the conclusion
and nal observations are in section 5.

where s are three matrices 33, dened by (si)jk =
i ijk, where ijk is the levi-civita totally anti-
symmetric tensor normalized so that 123 = 1 and
s   = (si)jk jbk.

with this denition the si matrices have the ex-

plicit structure

now we want to look for a fermion-like formula-
tion of these equations based on the work of majo-
rana [15]. in his work majorana has enhanced the
role in electrodynamics of the complex quantity
f = e  ib. this importance has been attempted
lately by weinberg [16] and others [17]. the main
motivation for this construction is the well known
fact that at statistical level, the electric and mag-
netic elds e and b are connected (through the
quantity e2 + b2) to the local mean number of
photons. hence, it can be constructed an expres-
sion for the probability quantum wave of a photon
in terms of e and b. it provides a meaning dif-
ferent of the usual one, where the electromagnetic
four-potential is introduced.

the rst step is to construct elements and vec-
tors that allow us to couple two equations in only
one. to accomplish this we note that equations (3)
and (4), for j = 0, can be rewritten as

in order to express eq. (5) and (6) in a fermion-
like formulation we dene two important 6  6 ma-
trices,

0 i (cid:19) and ~ = (cid:18) 0 s

0 = (cid:18) i 0
0 and ~ are equivalent to the dirac gamma ma-
trices. this way we can also introduce a matrix
that is equivalent to diracs 5,

s 0 (cid:19) ,

(9)

i 0 (cid:19)
5 = (cid:18) 0 i

(10)

where i is the 3  3 identity matrix. one can check
that { 5 ,  } = 0 ,  = 0, . . . , 3.

with these denitions equations (5) and (6) can

be put in a more compact form

i


t

=

1
i

(s  ) 

 ( t + s   )  = 0

(11)

which resembles the massless dirac equation, and
one can consider  as a (quantum) wave function
for the photon of the type

 = (cid:18) e

i b (cid:19)

and

(12)

(13)

 = (cid:0) e

ib (cid:1)

where  =  0 is an analog of the hermitian
conjugated denition. notice that only e and b
have physical meaning and we will use e and b
as auxiliary elds. so, we can note that   =

e2 + b2, with e = e and b = b, as we have
stressed before. now we can see the importance
of the introduction of the complex notation in the
construction of  as a dirac spinor.

in terms of the  matrices we may rewrite (11)

(23)

 ( 0 t + ~   )  = 0

(15)

and

or in a compact form

   = 0 ,

(16)

expressing a covariant-like form.

iii. chirality and duality

transformations

we can also note that eq. (16) is invariant under

the chiral transformation

   = ei  5 

(17)

 i

(i b)

t

=

1
i

(s  ) e ,

(24)

which are the hermitian conjugated of (5) and (6)
respectively. the equations of motion for e and b
are obtained from

l
e
i

= 0

and

l
b
i

= 0 ,

(25)

and as result we have equations (5) and (6).

equations (1) and (2) for  = 0, comes from the
fact that e and b are orthogonal to the propaga-
tion vector, namely

in terms of the elds e and b we have

k  e = 0

and

k  b = 0 .

(26)

e = cose  sinb
b = cosb + sine ,

(18)

which is a rotation and, particularly for  = /2
we recover the duality transformation.

this invariance can also be veried in the fol-

lowing lagrangian density

l = i  ( 0 t + ~   ) 

(19)

or compactly l = i   , where the vectors 
and  must be taken conveniently as independent.

in terms of e and b it is given by

l = i e e + i b b  e s  b + b s  e ,

the mass term. it is well known that a term like
  breakes the chiral invariance. in this formula-
tion it is given by

  = e  e  b  b .

(27)

which resembles the maxwell lagrangian density
(with e = e, b = b) and highlights the con-
nection between chiral symmetry and duality. a
mass term in the dirac-form is not invariant under
chiral transformation and the maxwell lagrangian
is not invariant under duality transformation.

iv. the generators of the

poincar e algebra

which is rst-order in time derivative and conse-
quently has a hamiltonian formulation. the phys-
ical quantities of the theory are real and the main
role of the auxiliary elds is in the mathematical
construction of the maxwell equations.

we can see that the equations of motion for e
and b can be obtained from the euler-lagrange
equations

notice that, as the schwarz-sen model, eq. (20)
is not a lorentz scalar. however, it is our task now
to demonstrate that the theory is relativistically
invariant as it obeys the poincare algebra.

we construct the generators of the poincare
algebra in the usual way, that is, the energy-
momentum tensor as

so, we have demonstrated that the action in eq.
(20) describes a theory that is relativistically in-
variant on-shell.

v. conclusions

it was analyzed an already known fermion-like
formulation for the electromagnetic theory and we
have introduced a corresponding lagrangian in-
variant under duality transformation. this in-
variance can be seen as a particular case of chi-
ral transformation in the fermion-like formulation.
we have carried out our analysis in order to verify
the poincare invariance of this formulation, and
have found that, although not being manifestly
covariant, it is relativistically invariant on-shell.
we also have compared the chiral variant mass
term with the maxwell lagrangian, which is du-
ality noninvariant.
