abstract

we propose that stromingers method to derive the btz black hole
entropy is in fact applicable to other asymptotically ads3 black holes
and gives the correct functional form of the entropy. we discuss var-
ious ads3 solutions in the einstein-maxwell theory, dilaton gravity,
einstein-scalar theories, and einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory. as
far as we are aware, all solutions are consistent with our proposal.

1 introduction

strominger has derived the bekenstein-hawking entropy of the banados-
teitelboim-zanelli (btz) black hole [1, 2] from the asymptotic virasoro
algebra [3]. recently, we applied stromingers method [4] to a solution
found by martnez and zanelli (mz) [5]. this is the static solution of three-
dimensional gravity with a conformal scalar eld. the solution is not ads3
but it is asymptotically ads3 (see section 3 for the denition of asymptot-
ically ads3); therefore, it has the asymptotic virasoro algebra. we found
that the functional form of the bekenstein-hawking entropy agrees with the
boundary conformal eld theory (cft) prediction. the overall numerical
coecient does not agree however; this is because this approach gives the
maximum possible entropy for the numerical coecient [6].

in this paper, we consider the extension of our approach. we propose that
stromingers method is in fact applicable to other asymptotically ads3 black
holes and gives the correct functional form of the entropy. in section 2, we
discuss the stationary black hole solution of three-dimensional gravity with
a conformal scalar eld. when angular momentum j = 0, it reduces to the
mz solution. the bekenstein-hawking entropy formula of the black hole
has the same form as cardys formula, e.g., the entropy is the sum of the
holomorphic part plus the anti-holomorphic part.

in section 3, we discuss other asymptotically ads3 black holes. we con-
sider solutions of the einstein-maxwell theory, dilaton gravity, einstein-scalar
theories, and einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory [1], [7]-[19]. as far as we are
aware, all solutions are consistent with our proposal.

in appendix a, we discuss the hamiltonian formalism [20] to dene the
mass and angular momentum of black holes. we also prove that the charges
in the hamiltonian formalism are conformally invariant up to the reference
terms for a generic einstein-scalar theory in appendix b.

2.2 stationary solution

a stationary metric can be written as

ds2 = (n )2(r)dt2 + f 2(r)dr2 + r2(r){d + n (r)dt}2.

(8)

in 2+1 dimensions, a stationary black hole solution can be generated from a
static black hole solution by a coordinate transformation since the trans-
formation can be done only locally [21].

this is because the spacetime is not simply connected; closed curves which
encircle the horizon cannot be shrunk to a point. thus, the rst betti number
b1 is equal to one and there is a closed 1-form which is not exact. suppose a
stationary solution is generated from the following transformation:

t = at + b,

(9)

where x and x are the coordinates of a static and a stationary solution;
a and b are constants. there is a timelike killing vector  = t in both
solutions. the vector elds are mapped onto each other under a global
dieomorphism. given the vector, one can construct a 1-form v which is
inverse to ; v  /||2. in the static solution, v = dt, which is an exact
1-form. this is transformed as v = adt + bd formally in the stationary
solution. this is a closed 1-form but not exact because the period of v
about closed curves c enclosing the horizon does not vanish:

zc

v = bzc

d = 2b.

(10)

thus, these 1-forms are mapped to each other only locally. because a metric
maps vectors to 1-forms, this means that metrics cannot be mapped to each
other either.

one also has to make the transformation  = bt+a and 2  r2/(a2b2)
as r   in order that the resulting metrics become asymptotically ads3.
we therefore make the following coordinate transformation to the r+ = 1
solution:

l   r+ r

r+ !  t

l ! ,

(11)

l  ! =

.

(12)

this is the same coordinate transformation used to generate the stationary
btz black hole. the coordinate transformation ensures that n  and grr
vanish at r = r under appropriate conditions.

applying the coordinate transformation, one obtains

(14)

as in the btz black hole, we now identify    + 2 instead of .

since n  and grr vanish at r = r, r represent the locations of the outer
and the inner horizon. this can be seen by using eddington-finkelstein like
coordinates:

dv = dt + h(r)dr,

d  = d + k(r)dr,

(15)

where

h(r) =

thus, the surface r = r+ is a null surface generated by the geodesics

at r = r+. here, we used g r = 0 at r = r+. so, r decreases or remains

on the other hand, the inner horizon r = r is actually singular because

formalism for a slightly more general action than eq. (1). for the action (1),
the charges are given by eq.(64). using the zero-mass black hole

for the stationary solution (13).

in order for the solution to be a black hole (i.e., no naked singularity),

one must have r+  r or

m > 0,

|j|  ml.

(25)

however, in the extreme limit |j| = ml, the singularity completely disap-
pears; the solution becomes the extreme btz black hole by an appropriate
coordinate transformation.

the static limit r = rerg is always outside the outer horizon since g00 is a

monotonically decreasing function and g00 > 0 at the outer horizon.

the metric (13) approaches ads3 asymptotically, 1 i.e.,

ds2  

r2
l2 dt2 +

l2
r2 dr2 + r2d2.

(26)

moreover, the metric satises the boundary conditions given by brown and
henneaux [22]. therefore, there should exist the asymptotic virasoro alge-
bra.

2.3 thermodynamics

the entropy of the black hole is given by

sbh =

r+
3g

.

(27)

the entropy does not satisfy the area law sbh = a/(4g). this is because
the solution (13) is not written in terms of the einstein metric [4].

the horizon r = r+ is also a killing horizon, i.e., a null surface to which

a killing vector is normal. the relevant killing vector is

 =


t

+ h




,

where h is the angular velocity at the horizon:

the surface gravity  is dened by the killing vector as

(28)

(29)

(30)

1when we write . . . approaches ads3 asymptotically in this paper, it means that the
leading order terms of the metric are the same as the ads3 metric; this is dierent from
asymptotically ads3 which constrains subleading terms in the metric.

6

therefore, we dene the hawking temperature as
r2
+  r2
r+l2


2

162

t =

=

.

(31)

the hawking temperature depends on the normalization of the timelike
killing vector. since the spacetime is asymptotically ads3, there is no nat-
ural normalization we can take. equation (31) is the hawking temperature
with respect to the killing vector t. but the killing time is not the same
as the ane time of the asymptotic observer unlike asymptotic at space-
times; therefore, the physical signicance of the killing time is not entirely
clear. the temperature t (r) as seen by the observer at distance r = r is
given by the tolman relation [23]:

t (r) =

t

n (r)

,

(32)

which vanishes at innity; there is an innite redshift at innity.

from eqs. (23), (24), (27), and (31), one can check that the rst law of

thermodynamics is satised:

dm = t ds + h dj.

(33)

now, in terms of the mass (23) and the angular momentum (24), the

entropy is given by

sbh =

2

3 


s 2l(lm + j)

3g

+s 2l(lm  j)

3g

.

(34)

this has the same form as cardys formula, i.e., the entropy is the sum of
the holomorphic part plus the anti-holomorphic part. moreover, m and j
appear in the same form as l0 and l0 eigenvalues [4]. all these may be
reminiscent of the asymptotic cft.

however, the overall numerical coecient does not agree with the asymp-
totic cfts result. the central charge does not change from the pure-gravity
result due to the no-hair theorems [4]. then, one get for the cft prediction
as

s l(lm + j)

3 other ads3 solutions

in this section, we briey discuss other asymptotically ads3 solutions for
three-dimensional gravity with a cosmological constant and matter elds.
actually, only known asymptotically ads3 solutions are those for einstein-
scalar theories. thus, these are the only solutions to which one can apply
stromingers method. this is fortunate however; the entropy for other so-
lutions does not have the same form as cardys formula. in this sense, all
known solutions are consistent with our proposal.

to make discussion clear, we give the denition of asymptotically ads3:

(i) they should contain the black hole solution in question.

(ii) they should be invariant under the ads3 group o(2, 2) at spatial in-

nity.

(iii) they should make the surface integrals associated with the generators

of o(2, 2) nite.

in particular, conditions (i) and (ii) require that

(i) the metric of the solution should satisfy the boundary conditions given

by brown and henneaux [22].

3.1 einstein-maxwell theory

a static electrically charged solution was obtained by [1]. it was later gen-
eralized by various authors [7, 8, 9, 10]. the most general solution in this
category is [10]. the solution found by [9] is not a black hole, so is unin-
teresting for our purpose. these solutions approach ads3 asymptotically,
but none of the solutions are asymptotically ads3; the gauge eld produces
o(ln r) terms in metrics. note that condition (i) constrains the subleading
terms in metrics as well. moreover, the mass and angular momentum diverge
because of the logarithmic term, thus violating condition (iii) as well.

8

3.2 dilaton gravity

solutions are found by [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. the most general solution in
this category is [14, 16]. the action considered by [13, 16] is (in the string
metric)

(39)

when  = 1, the action corresponds to the low-energy bosonic string ac-
tion with a world-sheet conformal anomaly. the  = 1 solution is not
asymptotically ads3 though. the solutions satisfy condition (i) if  > 1.
the action of chan and mann [11, 14] is in the einstein metric and solutions
are not asymptotically ads3 except for pure gravity. however, the solutions
satisfy condition (i) in the string metric. the solutions after the transfor-
mation become those of [13, 16]; they satisfy condition (i) when 1 < n < 2
in their notation. refs. [12, 15] consider the d = 3 kaluza-klein theory with
a cosmological constant and corresponds to the  = 0 action.

for the static solutions, the entropy is written as

sbh =



2ag (cid:26) + 1

 + 2

8gm(cid:27)

1

2 + 1

2(2+3)

.

(40)

thus, the entropy does not have the form of cardys formula except when
   (pure gravity).

however, one cannot apply stromingers method to the solution. one ac-
tually needs to enforce stronger conditions than brown-henneauxs boundary

9

conditions. otherwise, the charges j [] associated with the symmetries di-
verge in general for deformed spacetimes. in other words, they do not satisfy
condition (iii).

for instance, consider the second term of eq. (64):

for metrics which

satisfy condition (i),

gijkl(cid:16)djqkl  qkldj(cid:17)  o(1).

(41)

since u  exp(2)  r1/(+1), the mass is generally expected to diverge.
thus, the boundary conditions one really needs are (a, b = t, )

e2qrr = o(r4), e2qra = o(r3),

e2qab = o(1),

e2 = o(r1/(+1)),

(42)


g is the zero-mass
for the metric perturbation q = g 
black hole metric. such a condition restricts the virasoro algebra so that the
canonical realization of the virasoro algebra does not exist.

3.3 einstein-scalar theories

chan has obtained a variety of solutions [17] which include the mz solution
as a special case. 2 some of them are asymptotically ads3:

 solution (22) of ref. [17]: the solution is not a black hole, but rather a

naked singularity.

 solutions (24) and (38): the solution does not satisfy condition (i), so

is not an asymptotically ads3.

 solutions (33) and (40): the solution satises condition (i). using
eq. (63), one can show that scalars do not contribute to the charges
j [] under asymptotic behavior of canonical variables and surface de-
formation vector; we have the same surface term as the one for pure
gravity. thus, the charges j [] obey the virasoro algebra and the
central charge does not change from the pure-gravity result.

2we use the word dilaton only if a theory is invariant under the dilatation,   +a.

when gauge elds are present, the gauge elds are allowed to transform as well.

10

 solution (28): the solution satises condition (i). however, the scalar
contributes to the charges j [], so one needs to reexamine the algebra.
the black holes (33) and (40) have the entropy sbh  m , so the functional

form agrees with cft predictions.

incidentally, some of chans actions contain m explicitly as a coupling
constant, so m is not an integration constant. one can redene the coupling
constants so that m does not appear in actions. he argues that this causes
a problem since the mass diverges in his quasilocal stress tensor formalism.
however, the mass remains nite in the hamiltonian formalism and agrees
with m in the original actions. also, for the solution (22), the mass in the
hamiltonian formalism diers by a numerical factor from the one given by
chan.

3.4 einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory

solutions are obtained by [10, 11, 18, 19]. the action of [10, 11, 18] is

s =

1

16g z d3xg e2(cid:26)r  4()2 +

2

l2  f 2(cid:27)

(43)

in the string metric. the gauge eld f couples to the dilaton in the ns-ns
gauge eld form. the most general solution for the action is [10].
the static electric solutions in the string metric are given by

where m is a parameter related to the mass of the solution. the solutions
of [10, 11] satisfy condition (i) in the string metric when  > 1. however,
it has the same problem as dilaton gravity. however, in general, the entropy

11

does not have the same form as cardys formula either. ref. [19] considers
a gauge eld which does not couple to the dilaton in the ns-ns eld form.
the solution of [19] does not approach ads3 asymptotically.
incidentally,
the presence of gauge elds could extend the virasoro algebra.

if one can rewrite the surface term (61) in terms of a total variation by

some asymptotic conditions, h dsi i i[] = j [], the hamiltonian h[] =
h[] + j [] has well-dened variational derivatives. for example, for three-
dimensional einstein gravity (with or without a conformally coupled scalar
eld), j is given by

the hamiltonian h[] is the generator of the transformation associated
with the surface deformation vector . if the vector  is an asymptotic killing
vector, then h[] is the generator of the asymptotic symmetry and gives a
conserved charge associated with it. since we have the constraint h[]  0,
the numerical value of the h[] is just the surface term j [].
if there is a timelike or rotational asymptotic killing vector, /t or /,
one can dene the mass or angular momentum as j [/t] and j [/]
respectively.

it is obvious from the above discussion that in the regge-teitelboim for-
malism, we can x the values of the charges only up to the reference values.

b conformal invariance of charges

in this appendix, we consider the dependence of the charges on the choice of
the conformal frame.

a conformal transformation such as g = 2() g is merely a change
of variables, so physical quantities such as the mass and angular momentum

14

should be invariant under a conformal transformation. we will show that
the charges in the regge-teitelboim formalism are actually invariant under
a conformal transformation, up to the reference values.

under a conformal transformation, various geometrical quantities trans-

form as

g = 2 g,

qg = ng,

since the bulk hamiltonian is given by neglecting surface term, the bulk
hamiltonian in the tilde frame is simply given by replacing various quantities
in the original hamiltonian with the corresponding quantities in the tilde
frame.

the canonical variables transform as (hij,  ; ij, p)  (hij,  =  ; ij, p),

where

hij = 2()hij,
ij = 2()ij,

p = p  2  d

after some calculation, we get

h =  h,

hi = hi.

on the other hand, since

n = n(dt) = (g00)1/2(dt) = (2g00)1/2(dt)

= 1(cid:16) n (dt)(cid:17) = 1n,

we have

 = n + i(i)

= ()n + i(i)
= n + i(i).

h[] = h[],

hence, we obtain

in each conformal frame, the surface term i i, which is necessary for well-
dened variation principle, has the same form in terms of quantities in the
conformal frame. by a straightforward calculation, we can also show

i = i.

that is,

d si i i[] = dsi i i[],

 j [] = j [].

this means that the values of the charges are independent of the choice of
conformal frames, up to any terms such as the reference values which vanish
for a variation of the canonical variables.
