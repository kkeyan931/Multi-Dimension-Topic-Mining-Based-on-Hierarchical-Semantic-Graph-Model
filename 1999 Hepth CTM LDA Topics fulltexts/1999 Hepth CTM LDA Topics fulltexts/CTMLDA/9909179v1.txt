abstract

we present a calculation of three point functions for a class of chiral operators, includ-
ing the primary ones, in d = 3, n = 8; d = 6, n = (2, 0) and d = 4, n = 4 superconformal
eld theories at large n . these theories are related to the infrared world-volume descrip-

tions of n coincident m2, m5 and d3 branes, respectively. the calculation is done in the

framework of the ads/cft correspondence and can be given a unied treatment employ-

ing a gravitational action in arbitrary dimensions d, coupled to a p + 1 form and suitably
compactied on adsd2p  s2+p. the interesting cases are obtained setting (d, p) to
the values (11, 5), (11, 2) and (10, 3).

0. introduction

the ads/cft correspondence [13] is a useful tool to study strongly coupled confor-

mal eld theories (cft). it relates the generating functional for correlation functions of

gauge invariant operators in certain large n cft to the on-shell value of a corresponding
dual supergravity action suitably compactied on ads  m spaces. when the dual pair
is known, a tree-level computation on the supergravity side gives a prediction on the oth-

erwise inaccessible strongly coupled cft. the most studied case relates iib supergravity
on ads5  s5 to d = 4, n = 4 large n su (n ) super yangmills (sym) theory, where a
variety of correlation functions have already been computed using the correspondence (see

the review [4] also for a list of references). in particular, three point functions for a set of

chiral primary operators (cpo), namely those corresponding to the so-called single trace

operators, have been computed in [5]. other three point functions involving the cpos

have been computed more recently in [6,7], in part with the aim of addressing eventually

the more complicated case of their four point functions [8].

the d = 4, n = 4 sym theory, which can be thought of as describing the low energy
dynamics of d3 branes in type iib superstring theory, is not the only example with 16

supersymmetric charges. other dual pairs involving maximally supersymmetric cft have
been identied in [1], namely 11d supergravity on ads7  s4 / d = 6, n = (2, 0) large
n scft and 11d supergravity on ads4  s7 / d = 3, n = 8 large n scft. these
pairs describe the low energy physics of n coincident m5 and m2 branes of m-theory,

respectively. in this respect, the ads/cft correspondence has been used in [9] to identify
cpo three point functions in the d = 6, n = (2, 0) scft case, while the present authors
produced in [10] the set of cpo three point functions for both cases. in this last reference,

we could treat simultaneously both cases by employing a gravitational action in arbitrary
dimensions d, coupled to a 1 +p form, suitably compactied on adsd2ps2+p. setting
at the end (d, p) to the values (11, 2) and (11, 5) allowed us to recover the m5 and m2

cases, respectively. we also noticed, with some surprise, that the general model with

(d, p) = (10, 3) was able to reproduce the super yangmills case worked out in [5].

as promised in [10], in this paper we present more details on the calculation leading

to the cpo three point functions for all of these maximally supersymmetric cfts. in

addition, we extend it to include another class of scalar chiral operators sitting in the

same short supermultiplets identied by the chiral primaries.

including them gives us

the chance of producing quite large a class of three point functions with minor eorts.

note that obtaining the additional three point functions from the cpo ones by using the

superconformal algebra seems possible in principle, but may be rather cumbersome. the

2

sources for the cpos are given according to the ads/cft correspondence by the kaluza

klein tower of scalar elds with lowest mass, to be denoted by si, while the extra primary
operators we wish to consider are scalar operators which couple to another kaluzaklein

tower of scalars to be denoted by ti. these si - ti elds are identied as mass eigenstates
contained in the perturbations of the trace of the metric on s2+p and of the 1 + p form on
s2+p. also, we show why our general model is expected to reproduce the super yangmills
case by setting (d, p) = (10, 3). this gives us the opportunity of computing a new class

of three point functions for the latter theory.

the paper is organized as follows. in sect. 1 we show why and how all these various

cases of maximally supersymmetric cft can be treated in a unied scheme which employs

a general gravitational action. in sect. 2 we present the calculation identifying the bulk

cubic couplings of those physical uctuations which couple to the primary operators of our

interest. in sect. 3 we use the couplings to compute the normalized three point functions

for the given set of primary operators. finally, in sect. 4 we present our conclusions and

leave appendix a to set some notations for the scalar spherical harmonics on the sphere

sn.

1. justication of the method

we consider rst the case of branes in m-theory. according to the ads/cft cor-

respondence principles [14], the low energy world volume conformal eld theory of n

coincident m5 (m2) branes at large n is described by d = 11 supergravity compactied
on ads7  s4 (ads4  s7) [1113]. the conformal operators of the cft on the ads
boundary are related by duality in a precise way to the operators of the bulk ads eld

theory representing the uctuations of the supergravity elds around a maximally super-

symmetric freundrubin background [14]. as explained in the introduction, the aim of

this paper is the computation of a class of bosonic three point functions of these cfts.

thus, we need to consider only a certain subset of bosonic uctuations described below.

the action of the bosonic sector in the usual 3 form formulation of d = 11 supergravity

on m11 is given by

i =

1

42 zm11 hr(g) g 1  f4  gf4 + 2

1
2

3 a3  f4  f4i.

(1.1)

here, r(g) is the ricci scalar of the metric g and f4 = da3 is the 4 form eld strength of
the 3 form eld a3.

3

for the m5 theory, m11 = ads7  s4. the freundrubin background g, a3 is
such that g is factorized and f4 = f(0,4)
1. the uctuations of g and a3 around the
background, relevant in the analysis that follows, are such that g remains factorized and
f4 = f(0,4) + da(0,3). by dimensional reasons, for such uctuations the integrand of the
chernsimons term vanishes identically. thus, we may use the truncated action

i =

(1.2)

1

42 zads7s4 hr(g) g 1  f4  gf4i,
g = g  g, f4 = f(0,4) + da(0,3).

(1.3)
for the m2 theory, m11 = ads4  s7. the freundrubin background g, a3 is such
that g is factorized and f4 = f(4,0). the relevant uctuations of g and a3 around the
background are such that g remains factorized and f4 = f(4,0) + da(3,0). the integrand
of the chernsimons term vanishes identically for such uctuations in this case as well by
dimensional reasons. thus, we may use the action

i =

1

42 zads4s7 hr(g) g 1  f4  gf4i,
g = g  g, f4 = f(4,0) + da(3,0).

(1.4)

(1.5)

supercially, this seems to parallel the m5 case closely. however, a closer inspection reveals
that the relevant scalar uctuation contained in a(3,0) comes about as the solution of the
constraint

d g  a(3,0) = 0

(1.6)

entailed by gauge xing at quadratic level, which is dicult to implement in an oshell
fashion. this problem can be solved by means of a standard dualization trick. on notes

that the action r (da3gda3) is the reduction of the more general action r (f4gf4 +
2f7  (f4  da3)) upon substituting the f7 eld equation f4  da3 = 0. substituting
rst instead the a3 and f4 eld equations df7 = 0, f7 = gf4, one gets the equivalent
dual action r (da6  gda6), where a6 is the 6 form eld solving the bianchi identity
1 consider the d dimensional space time md = adsd2p  s2+p. we say that a
metric g on md is factorized if g has the block structure g = g  g, where g, g are
metrics on adsd2p, s2+p, respectively. we denote form degree on md by a subx, e.
g. r is a r form on md. similarly, we denote form degree on the factors adsd2p, s2+p
by a pair of suxes, e. g. (r,s) denotes a r + s form on md that is a r form on adsd2p
and a s form on s2+p.

4

in the dual formulation, the freundrubin background g, a6 is such that g
df7 = 0.
is again factorized and f7 = f(0,7). the relevant uctuations of g and a6 around the
background are such that g remains factorized and f7 = f(0,7) + da(0,6). to summarize,
the action is

i =

1

42 zads4s7 hr(g) g 1  f7  gf7i,
g = g  g, f7 = f(0,7) + da(0,6).

(1.7)

(1.8)

we now turn to the case of d3 branes in type iib superstring theory. according

to the ads/cft correspondence, the low energy world volume conformal eld theory of

a large number of coincident d3 branes is described by d = 10 type iib supergravity
compactied on ads5  s5. again, the conformal operators of the cft on the ads
boundary are related by duality in a precise way to the operators of the bulk ads eld

theory representing the uctuations of the iib supergravity elds around a maximally

supersymmetric selfdual freundrubin background [15]. to compute the set of bosonic

three point functions we are interested in, we need to consider only a certain subset of

bosonic uctuations described below. we may try to proceed as we did above dealing with

m theory and begin our discussion from the fully covariant action of the bosonic sector of

type iib supergravity worked out in ref. [16], but this does not seem to bring us that far.

thus, we follow a dierent path which we are now going to explain.

for the d3 brane, space time is m10 = ads5  s5. the relevant elds are the metric

g and the ramondramond 4 form eld a4 with selfdual eld strength f sd

5 = da4

further, einsteins eld equations hold

5 = gf sd
f sd
5 .

(1.9)

(1.10)

5 i  gf sd
r(g)ij g 1 = f sd
ijklmdxj  dxk  dxl  dxm.
4! f sd

5 i = 1

5 j

where r(g)ij is the ricci tensor and f sd

the selfdual freundrubin background g, a4 is such that g is factorized and f sd
5 =
2 ( f(0,5) + g f(0,5)). the relevant uctuations of g and a4 around the background are
2 (a(4,0) + a(0,4)).

2 1
such that g is factorized, as usual, and f sd
the selfduality equations relate the uctuations a(4,0), a(0,4) as

5 + da4, where a4 = 2 1

5 = f sd

g (d(1,0)a(0,4))  d(0,1)a(4,0) = 0,
g (d(0,1)a(0,4))  d(1,0)a(4,0) + (g  g) f(0,5) = 0.

(1.11a)

(1.11b)

5

therefore, a(4,0) is not independent of a(0,4) as eq. (1.11a) allows in principle to express
a(4,0) in terms of a(0,4). taking the selfduality equations into account, one can check that
einsteins equation can be written in terms of a(0,4) only

r(g)ij g 1 = ( f(0,5) + da(0,4))i  g( f(0,5) + da(0,4))j

 1

2 gij( f(0,5) + da(0,4))  g( f(0,5) + da(0,4)).

(1.12)

let us examine the above eld equations from another point of view. we consider an

action of the form

i = zads5s5 hr(g) g 1  f5  gf5i,

(1.13)

where g is a metric and f5 = da4 is a 5 form eld strength, not necessarily selfdual. we
pick a freundrubin like background g, a4 where g is factorized as usual and f5 = f(0,5).
we restrict to uctuations for which g remains factorized and f5 = f(0,5) + da(0,4). the
eld equations deduced from this action for the a(0,4) uctuations are

d(0,1)(cid:0) g (d(1,0)a(0,4))(cid:1) = 0,
d(0,1)(cid:0) g (d(0,1)a(0,4)) + (g  g) f(0,5)(cid:1) + d(1,0)(cid:0) g (d(1,0)a(0,4))(cid:1) = 0.

from (1.14a), recalling that h 1

derham(s5) = 0, one has

for some 4 form a(4,0). substituting this relation in (1.14b), one gets

g(d(1,0)a(0,4)) = d(0,1)a(4,0)

d(0,1)(cid:0) g (d(0,1)a(0,4))  d(1,0)a(4,0) + (g  g) f(0,5)(cid:1) = 0.

using that h 0

derham(s5) = r, this equation can be integrated once, yielding

g(d(0,1)a(0,4))  d(1,0)a(4,0) + (g  g) f(0,5) = (5,0),

where the 5 form (5,0) satises

d(0,1)(5,0) = 0,

(1.14a)

(1.14b)

(1.15)

(1.16)

(1.17)

(1.18)

but is otherwise arbitrary. as h 5

derham(ads5) = 0, there is a 4 form (4,0) such that

(5,0) = d(1,0)(4,0),

d(0,1)(4,0) = 0.

(1.19)

now, from (1.15), it is evident that a(4,0) is not uniquely dened and might be redened
into a(4,0)  (4,0). by doing so, we can assume that

(5,0) = 0

6

(1.20)

in eq. (1.17). we could have arrived to eq. (1.20) more directly by noting that we need
to consider only small perturbations around the chosen background. taking the limit
of vanishing perturbations in eq. (1.17) and requiring that the background satises the
resulting equation of motion xes (5,0) = 0. in conclusion, eqs. (1.14a), (1.14b) have the
same content as eqs. (1.11a), (1.11b). the einsteins eld equations following from (1.13)
are the same as (1.12). thus, by the above reasoning, the selfdual dynamics of the relevant
bosonic type iib uctuations is reduced to that of the the eld g and a(0,4) with action

i =

1

42 zads5s5 hr(g) g 1  f5  gf5i,
g = g  g, f5 = f(0,5) + da(0,4).

(1.21)

(1.22)

the upshot of the above discussion is that all three models described above may be

treated on the same footing as follows, in spite of their dierent physical content.

space time md is adsd2ps2+p. the relevant elds are the metric g and the 1 +p
form eld a1+p. the freundrubin background g, a1+p is such that g is factorized and
f2+p = f(0,2+p). the relevant bosonic uctuations of g and a1+p around the background
are such that g remains factorized and f2+p = f(0,2+p) + da(0,1+p). the action eectively
describing the dynamics of the uctuations is

i =

1

42 zadsd2ps2+p hr(g) g 1  f2+p  gf2+pi,
g = g  g, f2+p = f(0,2+p) + da(0,1+p).

(1.23)

(1.24)

the physically important cases are those for which (d, p) = (11, 2), (11, 5), (10, 3).

2. implementation of the method

we are now going to concretely implement the method described in the former section.
our starting point is the general action in eq. (1.23). one can easily verify that the eld
equations admit the standard adsd2p  s2+p solution gij, ai1i1+p generated by the
freund rubin ansatz [14]. for this, the only non vanishing components of the riemann
tensor and eld strength are given by

r = a1(gg  g g),
r = a2(g g  gg),

a1 =

a2 =

(1 + p)

(d  2)(d  3  p)
(d  3  p)
(d  2)(1 + p)

e2,

f12+p = e12+p ,

other f = 0,

7

e2,

(2.1a)

(2.1b)

(2.2)

where 12+p denotes the standard volume form on the unit sphere and e is an arbitrary
mass scale parametrizing the compactication 2.

we expand the action in uctuations around the background gij, ai1i1+p . we
parametrize the uctuations gij, ai1i1+p of the elds gij, ai1i1+p around the back-
ground as in [11]

d4p g,

g = h  1
g = k + l,
k = 0,
g = m + n + n + (    1
m

 = 0,

2+p g  )q + 1

2+p g,

m = 0,

 n = 0,

a11+p = (1 + p) [1 a21+p] + 11+p

a31+p = 0.

 b,

(2.3a)

(2.3b)

(2.3c)

(2.4)

fluctuations of the other components of ai1i1+p can be disregarded as they are inde-
pendent from the ones we are interested in, and we can set them directly to zero. before
describing the calculation, we note that one could partially x the gauge by eliminating
those gauge invariances that do not correspond to the usual reparametrization and form
gauge invariances from the adsd2p perspective. this could be done by imposing

2+p gg

g = 0;

(cid:0)g  1

(cid:1) = 0,
ai1ip = 0,

(2.5a)  (2.5b)
(2.6)
as shown in [11]. these conditions imply in particular that l = 0, n + n = 0,
2+p g  )q = 0 and a1p = 0. so, upon gauge xing, the eld equations
(    1
of the elds l, n, q and a1p must be enforced by hand as constraints. however, in the
sequel we will not need to proceed this way. rather, we will identify the action describing
the dynamics of the physical scalar elds contained in the -b uctuations by taking care
of the constraints associated with the various gauge invariances using eld redenitions.

denote md indices. late greek lower case letters , , ,  . . . denote adsd2p indices.
early greek lower case letters , , , , . . . denote s2+p indices.

above, we show the terms containing the elds h, , b only, since they contain the
relevant scalar uctuations s and t which couple to the chiral operator of the boundary
conformal eld theory of our interest.

instead of xing the gauge right away, we isolate the relevant scalar degrees of freedom
by performing suitable eld redenitions, as done in [17,18]. we write the ads metric
uctuations as

as previously mentioned, the elds q and l act as lagrange multipliers enforcing cer-
tain constraints involving h, , b. such constraints, however, do not aect the quadratic
and cubic terms of the elds s and t in the action, which are thus gauge invariant. this
can be shown as follows.

to linear order, the constraints can be read o from the part i constr

of the quadratic
action i[2] which is linear in the elds directly involved by gauge xing such as l, n, q,

in this way, the linear order constraints are simply conditions on  and decouple from s
and t. at higher orders, the constraints yielded by gauge xing are therefore of the form



 = c(, s, t) + . . . ,

  

 = d(, s, t) + . . . ,

(2.31a)

(2.31b)

where c(, s, t), d(, s, t) are certain composites of the elds , s, t of polynomial
degree at least 2 and the ellipses denote contributions containing other elds. thus, it is

evident that the  terms of the quadratic action yield no sss, sst, tts, ttt couplings at

cubic level via the constraints. since there are no , b terms in the quadratic action,

the constraints cannot generate any sss, sst, tts, ttt couplings from these at cubic level.

higher order terms involving  produce obviously no contribution to the cubic coupling
terms of s and t. thus, the s, t action i st
[3] is not aected by the constraints associated
with gauge xing as announced.

from (2.13) and (2.17a), it appears that the kinetic term of the elds si with k = 0, 1
vanishes. therefore, such elds are non propagating gauge degrees of freedom. consistency

requires that they should decouple from all the propagating physical elds. indeed it is
easy to check that the coupling constants gsss
i1i2i3 (cfr. eqs. (2.16a)(2.16c))
all vanish whenever the elds si with k = 0, 1 are involved. to this end, one has to use
the property that the triple contraction hci1ci2ci3i vanishes unless the values of the non
negative integers k1, k2, k3 are such to allow complete contraction of the so(3 + p) indices
of the ci s (see appendix a1).

the expressions of the coupling constants gi1i2i3 simplify considerably when the con-
stant  (cfr. eq. (2.17d)) vanishes. this happens precisely for (d, p) = (11, 2), (11, 5),
(10, 3). these values correspond to the physically interesting cases of ads7s4, ads4s7,
ads5  s5.

3. application of the method

we are now ready to compute two and three point functions in the scfts using the
adsd+1/cftd correspondence. the general formulas derived in [19] work with ads radius
set to 1. assume that the ads scalar elds i correspond to the cft local eld oi. the
mass mi of i and the conformal dimension i of oi are related as

where ijk is the cubic coupling constant of i, j , k multiplied by the appropriate sym-
metry factor. the factors wi parametrize unknown proportionality constants which relate
the elds i to the sources of the operators oi, as in [5]. these factors can presumably
be xed by carefully studying absorption processes on the branes [20]. however, for the
present purposes we follow ref. [5] and x them to normalize the two point functions as

hoi(x)oj(y)i =

|x  y|2i

.

(3.5)

with this canonical normalization the three point functions are readily computed.

4. conclusions

we have derived three point functions for a set of chiral operators, including the pri-
mary ones, for the large n limit of maximally supersymmetric cftd in d = 3, 4, 6 using the
ads/cft correspondence. in obtaining such results we have used a general gravitational

action which could treat the dierent cases simultaneously. we have obtained the three

point couplings for the bulk elds on ads working at the level of the action. however, we

21

have also checked the correctness of our results by computing with a dierent method a

subset of the couplings. this method consists in identifying the quadratic corrections to

the linearized equations of motion and integrating them into an action, as done in [5].

some of the nal results for the three point correlation functions are not new, and can

be used as a check on our lengthy calculation and procedure. in particular, in the super
yang-mills case (ads5  s5) we have reproduced exactly the correlation functions for the
cpo hos
k(z)i re-
cently computed in [6] (the relevant bulk coupling are also given in [7]). other correlators

k(z)i worked out in [5], and the correlators hos

j (y)os

i (x)os

i (x)os

j (y)ot

are new predictions from the ads/cft correspondence. they could in principle be ob-

tained from the cpo correlators by a systematic use of the superconformal algebra [21],
though we have not attempted to do so. for the d = 6, n = (2, 0) scft (ads7  s4) we
[9]. actually, their results dier slightly
can compare our results for the cpos with ref.

from ours, though those authors seem to agree with our ndings [22]. all other results are
new as new is the case of the d = 3, n = 8 scft (ads4  s7).

we should mention that in obtaining the values of the correlation functions for cer-

tain extremal cases we have implicitly used an analytic continuation in the conformal

dimensions of the operators [23]. these extremal cases have the property that the bulk

three point couplings of the supergravity source elds apparently vanish. however this

zero is compensated by a divergent integral over ads to produce a nite nal result. a

recent analysis on these issues has appeared also in [24], supporting the use of analytic

continuation.

a1. scalar spherical harmonics

we describe the n-sphere of radius  = e1 by sn  {z2 = 2|z  rn+1}, and use
scalar spherical harmonics dened by yi = cii1...ik xi1 ...xik , where the coordinates xi = ezi
live on the unit sphere and the tensors cii1...ik form an orthonormal basis of the completely
i1...ik = ij . the yi are eigenfunctions of the
symmetric traceless tensors so that cii1 ...ikcj

one has

 yi = e2k(k + n  1)yi .
