gauge transformations on massless spin-1/2

particles and neutrino polarization as a

consequence of gauge invariance

the two-by-two representation of the sl(2, c) group is for spin-1/2 particles. start-
ing from this two-by-two representation, it is possible to construct the four-by-four
matrices for spin-1 particles. for massless particles, it is possible to construct four-
potentials from two-component sl(2, c) spinors. four potentials are subject to
gauge transformations and are gauge-dependent. then this gauge dependence nec-
essarily comes from the two-component spinors which make up the four-potential.
then there must be a gauge-dependent spinor. this gauge-dependent spinor is dis-
cussed in detail. it is shown that neutrino polarization is a consequence of gauge
invariance applicable to the two-by-two representation of the sl(2, c) group.

1 introduction

the purpose of this paper is to discuss the internal space-time symmetries of
massless particles, particularly their gauge degrees of freedom. the internal
space-time symmetries of massive and massless particles are dictated by the lit-
tle groups of the poincare group which are isomorphic to the three-dimensional
rotation group and the two-dimensional euclidean group respectively.1 the lit-
tle group is the maximal subgroup of the lorentz group whose transformations
leave the four-momentum of the particle invariant. using the properties of
these groups we would like to address the following questions.

on massless particles, there are still questions for which answers are not
readily available. why do spins have to be parallel or anti-parallel to the
momentum? while photons have a gauge degree of freedom with two pos-
sible spin directions, why do massless neutrinos have only one spin direction
without gauge degrees of freedom? the purpose of this note is to address
these questions within the framework of wigners little groups of the poincare
group.1

the group of lorentz transformations is generated by three rotation gen-
erators ji and three boost generators ki. they satisfy the commutation rela-
tions:

[ji, jj] = iijkjk,

[ji, kj] = iijkkk,

[ki, kj] = iijkjk.

(1)

in studying space-time symmetries dictated by wigners little group, it is im-
portant to choose a particular value of the four-momentum, for a massive

1

point particle, there is a lorentz frame in which the particle is at rest. in this
frame, the little group is the three-dimensional rotation group. this is the
fundamental symmetry associated with the concept of spin.

for a massless particle, there is no lorentz frame in which its momentum
is zero. thus we have to settle with a non-zero value of the momentum along
one convenient direction. the three-parameter little group in this case is iso-
morphic to the e(2) group. the rotational degree of freedom corresponds to
the helicity of the massless particle, while the translational degrees of freedom
are gauge degrees of the massless particle.2

in this report, we discuss rst the o(3)-like little group for a massive
particle. we then study the e(2)-like little group for massless particles. the
o(3)-like little group is applicable to a particle at rest. if the system is boosted
along the z axis, the little group becomes a lorentz-boosted rotation group,
whose generators still satisfy the commutation relations for the rotation group.
however, in the innite-momentum/zero-mass limit, the commutation relation
should become those for massless particles. this process can be carried out
for both spin-1 and spin-1/2 particles. this group-contraction process in
principle can be extended all higher-spin particles.
in this report, we are
particularly interested in spin-1/2 particles.

in sec. 2, we study the contraction of the o(3)-like little group to the
e(2)-like little group. in sec. 3, we discuss in detail the e(2)-like symmetry
of massless particles. secs. 4 and 5 are devoted to the question of neutrino
polarizations and gauge transformation.

recently, the lorentz group has established its prominence in optics. for
instance, from the mathematical point of view, squeezed state are innite-
dimensional unitary representations of the lorentz group. as for nite spinor
representations, it is possible to formulate optical lters in terms of the two-
by-two matrix of the sl(2, c) group. in sec. 6, we give a brief review of the
recent development in this eld and its relevance to the physics of neutrinos
and photons.

2 massless particle as a limiting case of massive particle

the o(3)-like little group for a particle at rest is generated by j1, j2, and
j3. if the particle is boosted along the z direction with the boost operator
b() = exp (ik3), the little group is generated by j 
i = b()jib().
because j3 commutes with k3, j3 remains invariant under this boost. j 
1 and
j 
2 take the form

j 
1 = (cosh )j1 + (sinh )k2,

j 
2 = (cosh )j2  (sinh )k1.

(2)

2

the boost parameter  becomes innite if the mass of the particle becomes
vanishingly small. for large values of , we can consider n1 and n2 dened
as n1 = (cosh )1j 
1 respectively. then, in the
innite- limit,

2 and n2 = (cosh )1j 

n1 = k1  j2,

n2 = k2 + j1.

these operators satisfy the commutation relations

[j3, n1] = in2,

[j3, n2] = in1,

[n1, n2] = 0.

(3)

(4)

j3, n1, and n2 are the generators of the e(2)-like little group for massless
particles.

in order to relate the above little group to transformations more familiar
to us, let us consider the two-dimensional xy coordinate system. we can make
rotations around the origin and translations along the x and y axes. the
rotation generator lz takes the form

lz = i(cid:26)x


y

 y



x(cid:27) .

the translation generators are

px = i


x

,

py = i


y

.

these generators satisfy the commutation relations:

(5)

(6)

[lz, px] = ipy,

[lz, py] = ipx

[px, py] = 0.

(7)

these commutation relations are like those given in eq.(4). they become
identical if lz, px and py are replaced by j1, n2 and n3 respectively. this is
the reason why the little group for massless particles is like e(2).

3 symmetry of massless particles

the internal space-time symmetry of massless particles is governed by the
cylindrical group which is locally isomorphic to two-dimensional euclidean
group.2 in this case, we can visualize a circular cylinder whose axis is parallel
to the momentum. on the surface of this cylinder, we can rotate a point around
the axis or translate along the direction of the axis. the rotational degree of
freedom is associated with the helicity, while the translation corresponds to a
gauge transformation in the case of photons.

the question then is whether this translational degree of freedom is shared
by all massless particles, including neutrinos and gravitons. we shall see in

3

this paper that the requirement of gauge invariance leads to the polarization
of neutrinos.3 since this translational degree of freedom is a gauge degree of
freedom for photons, we can extend the concept of gauge transformations to
all massless particles including neutrinos.

if we use the four-vector convention x = (x, y, z, t), the generators of

rotations around and boosts along the z axis take the form

j3 = 


0 i 0

respectively. there are four other generators, but they are readily available
in the literature.4 they are applicable also to the four-potential of the electro-
magnetic eld or to a massive vector meson.

the role of j3 is well known.5 it is the helicity operator and generates

rotations around the momentum. the n1 and n2 matrices take the form4

the transformation matrix is

d(u, v) = exp {i (un1 + vn2)}

1 + (u2 + v2)/2

.

(10)




if this matrix is applied to the electromagnetic wave propagating along the z
direction

a(z, t) = (a1, a2, a3, a0)ei(zt),

(11)

which satises the lorentz condition a3 = a0, the d(u, v) matrix can be
reduced to3

d(u, v) = 


0
1
0
1
u v
u v

0 0
0 0
1 0
0 1

.




(12)

if a3 = a0, the four-vector (a1, a2, a3, a3) can be written as

(a1, a2, a3, a0) = (a1, a2, 0, 0) + (0, 0, , ),

(13)

4

with a3 = . the four-vector (0, 0, , ) represents the four-momentum. if
the d matrix of eq.(12) is applied to the above four vector, the result is

(a1, a2, a3, a0) = (a1, a2, 0, 0) + (0, 0, , ),

(14)

with  =  + (1/) (ua1 + va3). thus the d matrix performs a gauge trans-
formation when applied to the electromagnetic wave propagating along the z
direction.3,6,7

with the simplied form of the d matrix in eq.(12), it is possible to give
a geometrical interpretation of the little group. if we take into account of the
rotation around the z axis, the most general form of the little group transfor-
mations is r()d(u, v), where r() is the rotation matrix. the transformation
matrix is

r()d(u, v) = 


cos 

cos   sin  0

(15)

since the third and fourth rows are identical to each other, we can consider the
three-dimensional space (x, y, z, z). it is clear that r() performs a rotation
around the z axis. the d matrix performs translations along the z axis.
indeed, the internal space-time symmetry of massless particles is that of the
circular cylinder.2

4 massless spin-1/2 particles

the question then is whether we can carry out the same procedure for spin-1/2
massless particles. we can also ask the question of whether it is possible to
combine two spin 1/2 particles to construct a gauge-dependent four-potential.
with this point in mind, let us go back to the commutation relations of eq.(1).
they are invariant under the sign change of the boost operators. therefore,
if there is a representation of the lorentz group generated by ji and ki, it is
possible to construct a representation with ji and ki. for spin-1/2 particles,
rotations are generated by ji = 1
2 i or
ki = () i
2 i. the lorentz group in this representation is often called sl(2, c).

2 i, and the boosts by ki = (+) i

if we take the (+) sign, the n1 and n2 generators are

n1 = (cid:18) 0

0

i

0(cid:19) ,

n2 = (cid:18) 0 1

0 0(cid:19) .

(16)

on the other hand, for the (-) sign, we use the dotted representation for n1
and n2:

n1 = (cid:18) 0

i

0

0(cid:19) ,

n2 = (cid:18) 0

1

0

0(cid:19) .

(17)

5

there are therefore two dierent d matrices:

d(u, v) = (cid:18) 1 u  iv

1 (cid:19) ,

0

d(u, v) = (cid:18)

1

u  iv

0

1(cid:19) .

(18)

these are the gauge transformation matrices for massless spin-1/2 particles.3,4
as for the spinors, let us start with a massive particle at rest, and the
usual normalized pauli spinors + and  for the spin in the positive and
negative z directions respectively.
if we take into account lorentz boosts,
there are two additional spinors. we shall use the notation  to which the
boost generators ki = (+) i
2 i
are applicable. there are therefore four independent spinors.4,8 the sl(2, c)
spinors are gauge-invariant in the sense that

2 i are applicable, and chi to which ki = () i

d(u, v)+ = +,

d(u, v)  = .

(19)

on the other hand, the sl(2, c) spinors are gauge-dependent in the sense that

d(u, v) =  + (u  iv)+,

d(u, v) + = +  (u + iv) .

(20)

the gauge-invariant spinors of eq.(19) appear as polarized neutrinos in the
real world. the dirac equation for massless neutrinos contains only the gauge-
invariant sl(2, c) spinors.

5 the origin of gauge degrees of freedom

however, where do the above gauge-dependent spinors stand in the physics of
spin-1/2 particles? are they really responsible for the gauge dependence of
electromagnetic four-potentials when we construct a four-vector by taking a
bilinear combination of spinors?

the relation between the sl(2, c) spinors and the four-vectors has been
discussed in the literature for massive particles.4,9 however, is it true for the
massless case? the central issue is again the gauge transformation. the four-
potentials are gauge dependent, while the spinors allowed in the dirac equation
are gauge-invariant. therefore, it is not possible to construct four-potentials
from the dirac spinors. however, it is possible to construct the four-vector
with the four sl(2, c) spinors.4,8 indeed,

+ + = (1, i, 0, 0),

  = (1, i, 0, 0),

+  = (0, 0, 1, 1),

 + = (0, 0, 1, 1).

(21)

6

these unit vectors in one lorentz frame are not the unit vectors in other
frames. the d transformation applicable to the above four-vectors is clearly
d(u, v) d(u, v).

d(u, v) d(u, v)|+ + >= |+ + > (u + iv)|+  >,

d(u, v) d(u, v)|  >=   > (u + iv)|+  >,

d(u, v) (u, v)|+  >= |+  > .

(22)

the component  + = (0, 0, 1, 1) vanishes from the lorentz condition. the
rst two equations of the above expression correspond to the gauge transfor-
mations on the photon polarization vectors. the third equation describes the
eect of the d transformation on the four-momentum, conrming the fact that
d(u, v) is an element of the little group. the above operation is identical to
that of the four-by-four d matrix of eq.(12) on photon polarization vectors.

it is possible to construct a six-component maxwell tensor by making com-
binations of two undotted and dotted spinors.4 for massless particles, the only
gauge-invariant components are |++ > and |   >.10 they correspond
to the photons in the maxwell tensor representation with positive and neg-
ative helicities respectively.
it is also possible to construct maxwell-tensor
elds with for a massive particle, and obtain massless maxwell elds by group
contraction.12

6 lorentz group in polarization optics

in studying polarized light propagating along the z direction, the traditional
approach is to consider the x and y components of the electric elds. their
amplitude ratio and the phase dierence determine the degree of polarization.
thus, we can change the polarization either by adjusting the amplitudes, by
changing the relative phases, or both.
let us write these electric elds as

(cid:18) ex
ey (cid:19) = (cid:18) a exp {i(kz  t + 1)}

b exp {i(kz  t + 2)}(cid:19) .

(23)

where a and b are amplitudes which are real and positive numbers, and 1
and 2 are the phases of the x and y components respectively. this column
matrix is called the jones vector. in dealing with light waves, we have to realize
that the intensity is the quantity we measure. then there arises the question
of coherence and time average. we are thus led to consider the following

7

parameters.

s11 =< e 

xex >,

s22 =< e 

y ey >,

s12 =< e 

xey >,

s21 =< e 

y ex > .

(24)

these four quantities are known as the stokes parameters.

it is possible to treat the expression of eq.(23) as a two-component spinor
to which two-by-two sl(2, c) matrices are applicable. it is also possible to treat
the above parameters as the four components of a minkowskian four-vector.13
it is thus possible to study the symmetries of spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles by
performing polarization experiments in optics laboratories.
