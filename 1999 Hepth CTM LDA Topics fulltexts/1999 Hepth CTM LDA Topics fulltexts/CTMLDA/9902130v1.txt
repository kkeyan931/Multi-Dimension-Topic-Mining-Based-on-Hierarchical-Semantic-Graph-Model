mass and decay spectra of the piecewise

uniform string

i. brevik, a.a. bytsenko, and a.e. gonc alves

abstract. mass and decay spectra are calculated for quantum
massive exitations of a piecewise uniform bosonic string. the
physical meaning of the critical temperatures characterising the
radiation in the decay of a massive microstate in string theory is
discussed.

the composite string, in which the (relativistic) string is assumed
to consist of two (or more) separately uniform pieces, is a variant of
the conventional theory. this theory has been generalized and further
studied from various points of view [1] - [11]. the composite string
model may serve as a useful two-dimensional eld theoretical model.
usually, a two-dimensional eld theory describes a particular classi-
cal solution of string theory by constructing a matter system. the
vanishing total central charge of a system ensures the existence of a
brst operator, playing a crucial role in world-sheet and space-time
gauge invariance. such an operator can be interpreted as a generator
of linearized gauge transformations, mixing ghosts and matter.

it is very important that two-dimensional topological eld theories
(like ordinary string models) can sometimes be given space-time inter-
pretations for which the usual decoupling of ghosts and matter does
not hold. for example, three-dimensional chern-simons gauge theory
can arise as a string theory [12]. relations between gauge elds and
strings present fascinating and unanswered questions. the full answer
to these questions is of great importance for theoretical physics. it will
provide the true gauge degrees of freedom of the fundamental string
theories, and therefore also of gravity [13].

x (,  ) ( = 0, 1, 2,   (d  1)) specify the coordinates on the world
sheet. the action has the form

s = 

1

2 z d dt ()x x,

(1)

where t (), the position-dependent tension t () = ti +(tiiti)(
li), contains the step function (y > 0) = 1, (y < 0) = 0. the
tensions ti and tii are associated with the pieces li and lii of the
string. the momentum conjugate to x  is p () = t () x . the
hamiltonian of the two-dimensional sheet becomes accordingly

h = z 

0 hp() x   li d =

2 z 

0

t ()( x 2 + x 2)d,

(2)

where l is the lagrangian. the basic condition that we shall impose,
is that h = 0 when applied to the physical states. this is a more
weak condition than the strong condition t = 0 (,  = 0, 1) on the
energy-momentum tensor, applicable for a uniform string.

2. we quantize the system according to conventional methods as
presented in ref. [10] (see for detail ref. [14]). in accordance with the
canonical prescription in region i the equal-time commutation rules are
required to be

ti[ x (,  ), x (,  )] = i(  ),

and in region ii

(3)

tii[ x (,  ), x (,  )] = i(  ),

(4)
where  is the d-dimensional metric. these relations are in confor-
mity with the fact that the momentum conjugate to x  is in either
region equal to t () x . the remaining commutation relations vanish:

[x (,  ), x (,  )] = [ x (,  ),

(5)
the quantities to be promoted to fock state operators are n(s) and
n(s) (rst branch, region i), n(s) (rst branch, region ii), n(s1)
and n(s1) (second branch, region i), and n(s1) (second branch,
region ii), where s = lii/li. these operators satisfy

x (,  )] = 0.


n(s) = 

n (s), 
n (s1), 

n(s) = 
n (s),
n(s1) = 

n (s1),


n(s1) = 

(6)

for all n.

for the rst branch we then get

n(s), 

m(s)] = nn+m,0,

[

n(s), 

m(s)] = 4nxn+m,0,

(7)

with a similar relation for the n. here we put x = ti/tii. for the
second branch we get analogously

[

n(s1), 

m(s1)] = nn+m,0,

m(s1)] = 4nxn+m,0.

the commutation relations for the second branch are analogous, only
with the replacement s  s1. in the following we shall limit ourselves
to the rst branch only. the hamiltonians and mass are given by

and the condition ( ) = ( ) has been used. once the free energy
has been found, the other thermodynamic quantities can readily be
calculated. for instance, the energy u and the entropy s of the system
are u = (f )/, s = 2f/.

the integrand in eq. (14) is ultraviolet nite if

(17)

for a xed value of tii the hagedorn temperature is thus depends on
s. finally, let us consider the limiting case in which one of the pieces
of the string is much shorter than the other. physically this case is of
interest, since it corresponds to a point mass sitting on a string. since
we have assumed that s  1, this case corresponds to s  . we let
the tension tii be xed, though arbitrary. it is seen, rst of all, that
the hagedorn temperature (17) goes to innity so that f is always
ultraviolet nite, c  0, tc  . next, since exp (2t(s)/822)
can be taken to be small we obtain

physically speaking, the linear dependence of the rst term in eq. (18)
reects that the casimir energy of a little piece of string embedded in
an essentially innite string has for dimensional reasons to be inversely
proportional to the length li = /(1 + s)  /s of the little string.
the rst term in (18) is seen to outweigh the second, integral term,
which goes to zero when s  .

njnj is the occupation number of the n th mode. the inclusive
photon spectrum for the decay of state {nn} is given by the sum over
all states x satisfying the mass condition and has the form [15]

polarization vector and k = 0.
it can be shown that non-planar
contribution does not change the above result [15].

let m0 and 0 be the kaluza-klein momentum and winding number
associated with the state of closed string compactied on a circle of
radius r. for the piecewise uniform string the calculation of spectrum
factorizes into left-right parts of branch i, and a branch ii (note also
that [hi, hii] = 0). following the calculation presented in [15] we
obtain the nal result:

right- and left-moving modes are correspondingly given by t2 = 2(m 2

)1/2/(am), where q = m0/r  0r
and a = 2[(d  2)/6]1/2.
the decay spectrum can be given by analogy with black holes [16]:

the radiative spectrum from microscopic string states related with
region i and ii is exactly thermal. when m  q+, t2  t3 =

when s  0 (tc  0).

our fundamental theory is based upon the following two conditions
at the junctions: the transverse displacement itself, as well as the trans-
verse force, has to be continuous. moreover, we make two simplifying
assumptions: rst, the tension ratio x is taken to be small, x  0.
this assumption implies that the eigenvalue spectrum for the compos-
ite string becomes quite simple: there are two branches, the rst branch
corresponding to n(s) = (1 + s)n while the second branch correspond-
ing to n(s1) = (1 + s1)n, with n an integer. our second assumption
is that s is an integer.

we consider the rst branch only. the right- and left-moving ampli-
tudes in region i can be chosen freely, while the amplitudes in region ii
are thereafter xed. the oscillations in region i are therefore as for a
closed string, whereas the oscillations in region ii are standing waves,
corresponding to an open string. this is the physical background why
there is only one single critical temperature tc in region ii in eqs.(20)
and (22), while there are two critical temperatures t2 and t3 in region
i. it should be emphasized once more that our composite string is rela-
tivistic, in the sense that the transverse velocity of sound is everywhere
in the string equal to velocity of light. how to construct a compos-
ite string theory in the absence of this relativistic requirement is not
known.

finally we note that the black hole entropy behaviour can be un-
derstood in terms of the degeneracy of some interacting fundamental
string excitation mode. generally speaking the fundamental string and
p-brane approach can yield a microscopic interpretation of the entropy.
it will be interesting to consider phases of the piecewise uniform (super)
string and the bekenstein- hawking entropies of black holes associated
with this string. the entropies can be derived by counting black hole
microstates; the laws of black hole dynamics could then be identied
with the laws of thermodynamics. we hope that the proposed cal-
culation will be of interest in view of future applications to concrete
problems in string theory, quantum gravity and in black hole physics.
