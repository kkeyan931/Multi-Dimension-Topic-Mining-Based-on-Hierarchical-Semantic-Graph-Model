on generations

alejandro rivero

february 1, 2008

abstract

the well known operator ordering ambiguity could motivate the exis-
tence of generations. this possibility is explored by exploiting the rela-
tionship between ordering and discretization rules.

1 wilson fermion as analogy

non commutative geometry is not the only area knowing how to get mass
terms from nowhere. lattice theorists learnt time ago a nice trick from wilson.
consider the forward and backward discrete derivatives, +,  as usual

+f (x) =

f (x + )  f (x)



, f (x) =

f (x)  f (x  )



suitable derivatives in the lattice can be implemented as any linear combi-

quantum eect avoids the limit  going to zero, then the system taking account
dx f  f + 2f and, if two derivatives
of the ambiguity should be written d
are done, in order to account for the ambiguity we shall rewrite

m

dx2 f  m( + 12)( + 22)f

just as a funny notation, dene e(x)  f (x),   f ,   f , then:

dx2 = m02e + m12 + m22

note that m0, m1, m2 contain orders of 0, 1, 2 respectively.

introduction

please keep in mind that the real game is expected to be played in the ncg
space, where some additional sheets can accomodate more structure.

proposals to get the structure of quantum elementary objects from the dis-
cretization of space or its regularization are signicant in the literature. but we
are not aware of any suggestion to extract from there the spectrum of elemen-
tary fermions. this would include four avours of particles, two chiralities and
three generations.

we advanced this idea last year [5], jointly with other conjectures of diverse
quality (mostly slippery). as a piece of the puzzle, it was already suggested that
the existence of three generations of elementary particles is the method nature
uses to parametrize the ambiguity of quantization. here some additional toy
models are proposed to explore this point.

this letter is mainly a progress report, please refer to an hypothetical [4]
for context. denite advance will come someday from the interplay of lattice
theory and ncg; some attention has been put on it from the lattice side [6, 7],
but the ncg counterpart seems to sleep since [8] et al.

it is possible also to try to start sooner, let say from a naive ladder dl(x) 
(x  l), to see it as an innite matrix mechanics, and then duplicate, collect
and reorder vectors to connect with the above scheme. this naive ladder is
easier to link with other formulations, say kauman or costella, to name a pair
of interesting ones.

4 from quantization ambiguity to generations

consider x+ = f (t+)f (t)
quantization ordering rules. for generic ordering take x() =  x+ +  x.

and x = f (t)f (t)

. see [2] for their relation to

apply the previous method. you will need to duplicate the vector space,

and presumably to draw a more sophisticated representation af of functions.

for instance, let it be

f (t  ) + f (t)(cid:19) , f =

2 (cid:18) f (t + ) + f (t  )

f =

2 (cid:18) f (t + ) + f (t)
m4 m2(cid:19), and set d = (cid:18)

m = (cid:18) m1 m3

thus, putting m1 = m2 = 2/, m3 = m4 = 2/,

so that ambiguity xing at a combination ,  can be related via those toys to
a two generations structure with mass eigenvalues proportional to   . far
away from the order of magnitude of the real thing except if   , which, on
the other hand, is the usual symmetric guess,  =  to get weyl.

we conjecture that if our lagrangian had second order derivatives, we should
need three generations (alternatively, it could be considered to take dierent
ambiguity xing in each derivation). simultaneous tting of rst and second
derivatives is also interesting, because it suggests special mass relationships (for
instance,     1/).

the a matrix in the example shows an aspect more sensate in the basis
of mass eigenvectors, but we have preferred to keep it diagonal. out of the
toy model, more serious derivations must be done, for instance using [d, a] =
g[d, x] = [d, x] g with x coming from the obvious coordinate function f (x) =
x, and then linking the so dened derivatives g, g with the objects of barrow-
majid non-commutative calculus, and so on.

5 from pseudofermions to innitesimal

use  to regularize the lagrangian. our dierential elements are then replaced
by nite dierential slices.

a discrete dierential in a point is an ane covector instead of a free one,
which is the usual limit case. in 0 + 1 it is given by two points, that become two
parallel planes in physical space. the famous[3] wine dance argument from
feynman applies: rotation of one point is topologically equal to exchange.

our pseudo fermions in the previous section would absorb into themselves
this property, for the discrete summation to proceed without topological consid-

erations. ideally, the rule should be applied for each of the four dierentials1 in
3+1 space in order to get four fundamental particle elds. vectorial gauge elds
and anti-particles must be added following recipes in [1], in order to establish
dualities between homology and cohomology, thus guaranteeing the usual prop-
erties of integral calculus. this should also require some relationship between
masses of dierent particles, hopefully.

an additional clue should come from the uses of grassman variables (for in-
stance, in superspace formalism). reminder that such variables were suggested
in the xixth century as a way to formalize innitesimal calculus. a grass-
man variable could be presented as a very small interval such that its square
was orders of magnitude smaller, thus zero in approximative calculations. we
could expect that our fermions had some map into grassman variables when
the continuous limit is taken 2.

other attemtp to link dierentials and fermions is the kahler-dirac equation.

6 from there to the limit?

field theory is about nding the extremal of a functional f [f ]. to accomplish
it, we regularize the functional introducing two scales, two units a, a of position
and momentum respectively. then the limit is taken to remove the scale. if
aa  0, it is called classical eld theory. if aa  h, being h a nite constant, it
is called quantum eld theory.

point is, references to continuous and discrete worlds seem to forgot that
the former is built from the latter. the proof of existence of classical objects
involves a regularization jointly with a jump to the limit. it has been so since
archimedes age. but from wilson we know that such proofs are equivalent
to the existence of xed points in the space of regularizations, and that the
argument can be developed by referring anything to an scale h0. just as the
limit of a series an/bn  0/0 is got by referring all its elements to a nite
constant denominator.

the metaphysical justication of our toys would be to come someday to
claim that qft is the correct proof of existence of classical eld theory (well, it
should be closer to the proof of existence of a variational calculus). and that,
by some reason, nature does not like to make the jump into this limit.

postlude

even if you has not liked anyone of the previous, i am sure you will like this:
copenhagen, yet playing at the duchess theater, up the strand.

i was prevented about the script, but the author has made a deep research,
more careful than the usual newspaper comments about the meetings between

1if you feel uncomfort identifying dierentials and particles, try instead to say low energy
modes of an 1-brane (sorry, the temptation was too strng, at least i have put it on a footnote.
but please remember why they were called p-things, the p-branes). to identify particle elds
with special choosing of coordinate elds seems too far-fetched, but it is appealing to think
of conned elds as angular coordinates, without length units. so we have mixed feeling
about it.

2this is touchy, as those variables in classical mechanics are only a trick to formalize
variational calculus (we simply look for solutions f [f + ] = f [f ]); their role could be dierent

he asks for simplicity in the dialogue, because they must be able to explain
