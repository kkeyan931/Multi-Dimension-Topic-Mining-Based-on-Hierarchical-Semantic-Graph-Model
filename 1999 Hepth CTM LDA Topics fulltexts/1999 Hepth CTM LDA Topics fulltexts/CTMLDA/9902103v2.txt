flow equations

for the quantum electrodynamics

on the light-front

gutachter: prof. dr. franz wegner

prof. dr.hans-christian pauli

abstract

the method of ow equations is applied to qed on the light front. requiring that the
particle number conserving terms in the hamiltonian are considered to be diagonal and the other
terms o-diagonal an eective hamiltonian is obtained which reduces the positronium problem
to a two-particle problem, since the particle number violating contributions are eliminated.

using an eective electron-positron hamiltonian, obtained in the second order in coupling,
we analyze the positronium bound state problem analytically and numerically. the results ob-
tained for bohr spectrum and hyperne splitting coincide to a high accuracy with experimental
values. the rotational invariance, that is not manifest symmetry on the light-front, is recovered
for positronium mass spectrum.

except for the longitudinal infrared divergences, that are special for the light-front gauge
calculations, no infrared divergences appear. the ultraviolet renormalization in the second
order in coupling constant is performed simultaneously. to preserve boost invariance we take
into account the diagrams arising from the normal ordering of instantaneous interactions. using
ow equations and coupling coherence we obtain the counterterms for electron and photon
masses, which are free from longitudinal infrared divergences.

abstrakt

in dieser arbeit wird die methode von flugleichungen im lichtkegel-formalismus auf die
qed angewandt. wir konstruieren einen eektiven, block-diagonalen hamiltonian, wobei wir
fordern, da diejenigen terme, welche die teilchenzahl erhalten, diagonal sind, wahrend alle
anderen terme nichtdiagonal sind. dieser eektive hamiltonian vereinfacht das positronium-
problem auf ein zweikorper-problem, weil die anteile, die eine teilchenzahlanderung verur-
sachen, eliminiert sind.

mittels des eektiven elektron-positron-hamiltonians, der in der elektromagnetischen kop-
plung von zweiter ordnung ist, werden die bindungszustande des positroniums analytisch und
numerisch untersucht. unsere resultate fur das bohr-spektrum und die hyperfeinaufspaltung
stimmen sehr gut mit den experimentellen werten uberein. die rotationsinvarianz, welche auf
dem lichtkegel nicht mehr gewahrleistet ist, kann fur das massenspektrum wieder hergestellt
werden.

auer longitudinalen infrarot-divergenzen, die fur die lichtkegel-eichung spezisch sind,
treten bei den rechnungen keine infrarot-divergenzen auf. die renormierung der ultraviolet-
divergenzen bis zur zweiten ordnung in der kopplungskonstanten erhalt man mit der kon-
struktion des hamiltonians automatisch. um die invarianz des renormierten hamiltonian unter
boosts sicherzustellen, berucksichtigen wir auch die diagramme, welche aus der normalordnung
von instantanen wechselwirkungen entstehen. die aus den flugleichungen und der kop-
plungskoharenz resultierenden counterterme der photon- und elektronmasse erhalten dann
keine longitudinalen infrarot-divergenzen.

introduction

quantum chromodynamics (qcd) is widely accepted as the microscopic theory of strong inter-
action, where quarks and gluons are considered as the elementary degrees of freedom. but we
are still unable to solve this theory on the macroscopic level (in the low energy domain) and to
obtain an accurate description of the structure of hadrons, which are the strongly interacting
particles observed in nature.

a central goal of modern theoretical particle physics is to build a bridge between microscopic

(high energy) and macroscopic (low energy) domains of qcd.

at the microscopic level the theory is dened completely, and no further development seems
to be necessary. on the other side, when it comes to the macroscopic hadron world, there is
no rigorous way to calculate hadron properties immediately from qcd. one still has to resort
to dierent phenomenological methods and qcd-inspired models of covariant eld theory to
calculate the hadron mass spectrum, form factors, wave functions, etc. also lattice calculations
serving as a model-independent method in covariant eld theory improved our understanding
of the hadronic structure. however, besides dierent problems, this approach is still strongly
limited by the available computer power.

in this work we use the light-front formulation of eld theory, which is best suited for solving
relativistic bound state problems in qcd [1], because of the simplied vacuum structure.
we believe that light-front eld theory together with the renormalization group approach for
hamiltonians [2],[3] provides a good strategy to reach the above mentioned goal. the physical
idea behind this approach is to use the renormalization concept for hamiltonians on the light-
front to get an eective, low-energy hamiltonian.

recently, glazek and wilson suggested the renormalization scheme for hamiltonians, called
similarity renormalization by the authors, where they developed a renormalization group and
the basic elements of renormalization group calculations for hamiltonians on the light-front [3].
an alternative approach for hamiltonian renormalization, the method of ow equations, was
proposed by wegner [2]. it is common for both methods that they renormalize the canonical
hamiltonian of light-front eld theory to a given order of perturbation theory. a basic advantage
of the method of ow equations in comparison to the similarity renormalization scheme is that
one obtains an eective, renormalized hamiltonian for a limited (truncated) fock space.

the method of ow equations is based on the following idea: performing a set of innitesi-
mal unitary transformations, with the condition that the particle number conserving terms in
the hamiltonian are considered to be diagonal and the other terms o-diagonal, it is possible
to get the block-diagonal eective hamiltonian, where the particle number in each block is con-
served. this reduces the bound state problem to a few-body problem, since the particle number
violating contributions are eliminated. this procedure is similar to the tamm-danco space

6

truncation [33] in the sense that also in this truncation particle number changing interactions
are eliminated. the eective hamiltonian constructed by ow equations is automatically renor-
malized to the given order in the coupling constant, since an elimination of particle number
changing sectors can not be achieved in one step but rather sequently for transition amplitudes
from large to small energy dierences.

low-energy qcd is challenging and explicit calculations become complicated due to the
nonperturbative nature of this theory. to test and to illustrate our approach we consider
qed3+1 in the light-front dynamics and investigate the corresponding positronium bound
state problem.

this work is organized as follows: in chapter 2 we outline the theoretical framework by
giving the key ingredients of the ow equation method and by enumerating their applications
to problems of solid state physics and statistical mechanics done so far. the approach of
similarity renormalization is also considered. in chapter 3 we review the methods and results
known for light-front qed3+1. to second order in the coupling constant we obtain the eective,
renormalized qed hamiltonian (chapter 4), which reduces the positronium problem to a two-
particle problem to be analyzed further analytically (chapter 5) and numerically (chapter 6)
for positronium bound states. the renormalization issues of light-front qed are considered in
chapter 7.

flow equations

in this section we give the key ingredients of ow equations method and set up the framework
to use ow equations for the problems of high-energy physics.

flow equations are introduced in order to bring hamiltonians closer to diagonalization.
the method is based on the numerical recipe by jacobi, consisting of unitary transformations
between two states which makes the connecting o-diagonal matrix elements vanishing. if this
is repeated for all o-diagonal matrix elements again and again then the o-diagonal matrix
elements will become arbitrarily small.
it is characteristic for these equations that matrix
elements between degenerate or almost degenerate states do not decay or decay very slowly.
in the next section we follow the original work of wegner [2] to introduce ow equations for
hamiltonian matrices.

2.1 flow equations for hamiltonian matrices

the aim is to nd continuous unitary transformation, that brings hamiltonian to diagonal-
ization. continuous unitary transformation depend on the ow parameter l. we call it u(l).
in what follows we assume that u(0) = 1 is valid and that u() brings the given hamilto-
nian operator h or the given matrix h to the diagonal form. the operator h acquires the
l-dependence through the unitary transformation u(l)

h(l) = u +(l)hu(l)

(2.1)

if the transformation u(l) were known, one would nd h() and the problem would be
solved. generally, one does not know the transformation, which diagonalizes the given matrix.
therefore the transformation is formulated in innitesimal form

dh(l)

dl

= [(l), h(l)]

(2.2)

here  is the generator of transformation;  is antihermitian + = . the connection between
the unitary transformation and its generator is given

u(l) = exp z l

0

(l)dl!

where the ordering along l-axis is imposed. one has for the matrix elements

dhk,q(l)

dl

=xp

(k,p(l)hp,q(l)  hk,p(l)p,q(l))

8

(2.3)

(2.4)

the generator  must be chosen in a way, that the matrix h is more and more diagonal as l
k,q falls monotonously. we separate h = hd + hr and use

increases. we demand, that pk6=q h2

that use that t rh 2 is invariant under the unitary transformation

t rh 2

d + t rh 2

r = t rh 2 = const

(2.5)

pk6=q h2

k,q = t rh 2

r monoton falls when t rh 2

d increases. one has

dt rh 2
d

dl

dlxq

h2

q,q = 2xq

hq,qxp

(q,php,q  hq,pp,q) = 2xp,q

p,qhp,q(hp,p  hq,q)

(2.6)

the right hand side must be negative. the possible choice for the generator is p,q = hp,q(hp,p
hq,q) or

 = [hd, hr]

we have

dhk,q(l)

dl

=xp
h2
k,q = 

d

dl xk6=q
since pk6=q h2
the limit l  . therefore one has

h2

(hk,k(l) + hq,q(l)  2hp,p(l))hk,p(l)hp,q(l)
dlxk
d

k,k = 2xk,q

(hk,k  hq,q)2h2

k,q = 2xk,q

(2.7)

2
k,q

(2.8)

k,q falls monotonously and is restricted from below, the derivative must vanish in

(l) = [hd, h] l 0

(2.9)

practically we have reached the aim, the matrix commute with its diagonal part as l  .
the eqs. (2.2) and (2.9) are called ow equations for hamiltonians and are the basis for the
work presented further.

2.2 similarity transformation

another method to diagonalize hamiltonians continuously was suggested independently by
glazek and wilson [3], which has been called similarity transformation by the authors. in this
subsection we follow the original work of glazek and wilson [3] to give the key ingredients of
this scheme.

we dene the unitary transformation, that brings the hamiltonian operator in a form, where
no transitions between the states with energy dierence larger than  are present. the role of
ow parameter plays , which corresponds to the ultraviolet (uv)-cuto (see chapter 7) and
is changed continuously.

the hamiltonian operator h (and other quantities) depend then on the continuous param-
eter . the hamiltonian is given as a sum h = h0 + hi, where h0 is the free hamiltonian
and hi contains (not renormalized) interactions and counterterms.

we separate each matrix m into two parts, m = d(m)+r(m). let ei are the eigenvalues

of h0, and

xij = |ei  ej|
ei + ej + 

uij = u(xij), rij = 1  uij = r(xij)
9

(2.10)

and u(x) is the function, which is 1 for small arguments and vanishes for large arguments.
explicit one can choose for u(x)

u(x) = 1 f or 0  x 
u(x) f alls monotonously f rom 1 to 0 f or

1
3

u(x) = 0 f or

2
3  x  1

1
3  x 

2
3

(2.11)

we dene d(m)ij = uijmij and corresponding r(m)ij = rijmij. as we introduce uij and
rij, we have the continuous transition between d(m) and r(m).
it is important in order
to avoid the divergences in renormalization equations. when one chooses u(x) = (x0  x),
then one has the original denition for d(m) and r(m). the continuous transformation for
hamiltonian operator can be written as before in the form

dh
d

= [, h]

(2.12)

the generator  is chosen in a way that d(h) = h. for practical purpose to distinguish in
the calculations between the hamiltonian operator h and its d-part, it is useful to introduce
the operator q, such that

h = d(q)

then one has for the matrix elements

duij
d

qij + uij

dqij

d

= ij(ej  ei) + [, hi]ij

(2.13)

(2.14)

one is not able to nd q and  from this equation. the reason is, that for the given 
the hamiltonian operator h can be additionally transformed unitary without breaking the
condition d(h) = h. thus one has one more condition. we rewrite the above equation in
the form

uij

dqij
d  ij(ej  ei) = gij

where we dene

gij = [, hi]ij 

duij
d

qij

now let

and

uij

dqij

d

= d(g)ij

ij(ej  ei) = r(g)ij
now all functions are dened. one has

rij

duij
d

uij!

and

ij =

= uij[, hi]ij + rij

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

there are no small energy denominators in these equations. these equations should be solved
iteratively.

2.3 flow equations for solid state physics

flow equations were successfully applied to dierent systems in solid state physics. unitary
transformation in the form of exact diaginalization of hamiltonian operator has been tested in
(1) model of impurity in the electron band [5];
(2) dissipative quantum systems, in particular for spin-boson problem [6];
(3) lipkin model [7];
(4) problem of interacting electrons and phonons in a solid (referred to as bcs-theory) [10].
in all these models a system of interest couples to its environment hamiltonian (for example, in
(1) single impurity couples to the band of electrons; in (2) a small quantum system couples to the
thermodynamical bath). the aim is then to decouple small system from its large environment
to nd a behavior of the system. it is dierent from what is usually done: most theoretical work
starts o by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom and then using suitable approximation
schemes for the time evolution of the reduced density matrix of the small quantum system.
in general the approach of hamiltonian diagonalization is particularly suited for studying low-
energy properties of the system, thereby being complementary to most other approximation
schemes.

in some cases the aim to get the diagonal hamiltonian operator for l   can not be
reached. it was shown in the original work of wegner [2] for the model of interacting fermions
in one dimension, that a literal use of the concept of hamiltonian diagonalization can lead to
convergency problems. in the case discussed there the divergences appeared as l  . the
way out, as proposed by wegner [2], is to bring hamiltonian operator instead of diagonal to
the block-diagonal form, where the number of quasiparticles is conserved in each block.

in many cases it is enough to transform the given hamiltonian to the block-diagonal form.
in particular it is so, when the block, which describes the states of interest, can be treated fur-
ther with other methods. there are many known transformations, that construct in this way
from the initial hamiltonian operator an eective hamiltonian operator, acting in a smaller
hilbert space and which is simpler to consider. flow equations, where block-diagonalization is
performed, have been compared with the following transformations
(1) the schrieer-wol transformation, which reduces the anderson model with single magnetic
impurity to the kondo problem [8];
(2) the foldy-wouthuysen transformation, which decouples the dirac equation into two two-
component equations, one of which gives in the nonrelativistic limit the known pauli equation
[9];
(3) the frohlich transformation, which constructs from the electron-phonon interaction an ef-
fective electron-electron interaction [10]. in all these cases ow equations re-examine the trans-
formations used before.

2.4 flow equations in eld theory

in this section we set up the framework to use ow equations for the problems of high-energy
physics. we remind, that ow equations perform the unitary transformation, which brings the
hamiltonian to a block-diagonal form with the number of particles (or fock state) conserving in
each block. in what follows we distinguish between the diagonal (here fock state conserving)
and rest (fock state changing) sectors of the hamiltonian. we break the hamiltonian as

h = h0d + hd + hr

(2.21)

11

where h0d is the free hamiltonian; and the indices d,r correspond to diagonal,rest parts
of the hamiltonian, respectively. the ow equation for the hamiltonian eq. (2.2) and the
generator of unitary transformation eq. (2.7) are written [2]

= [, hd + hr] + [[hd, hr], h0d] + [[h0d, hr], h0d]

dh
dl
 = [h0d, hr] + [hd, hr]

in the basis of the eigenfunctions of the free hamiltonian

h0d|i >= ei|i >

one obtains for the matrix-elements between the many-particle states

= [, hd + hr]ij  (ei  ej)[hd, hr]ij  (ei  ej)2hrij

dhij
dl
ij = (ei  ej)hrij + [hd, hr]ij

the energy dierences are given by

ei  ej =

n2xk=1

ei,k 

n1xk=1

ej,k

(2.22)

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

where ei,k and ej,k are the energies of the created and annihilated particles, respectively. the
generator belongs to the rest sector, i.e. ij = rij, dij = 0. in what follows we use

[ or, hd]d = 0
[ or, hd]r 6= 0

(2.26)
where or is the operator from the rest sector (for example hr or r) and hd is the diagonal
part of hamiltonian.

for the diagonal (n1 = n2) and rest (n1 6= n2) sectors of the hamiltonian one has

correspondingly

dhdij

dl

dhrij

dl

= [, hr]dij

= [, hd + hr]rij  (ei  ej)[hd, hr]rij +

duij
dl

hrij
uij

where we have introduced the cuto function uij(l)

uij(l) = e(eiej)2l

(2.27)

(2.28)

the energies ei(l) start to depend on the ow parameter l in the second order of perturbation
theory, that is taken into account by the renormalization of single-particle electron and photon
energies (see chapter 7).

the main dierence between these two sectors is the presence of the third term in the rest

, which insures the band-diagonal structure for the rest part

sector duij
dl

hrij
uij
hrij = uij hrij

(2.29)
in the rest sector the matrix elements with the energy dierences larger than 1/l are
i.e.
suppressed. in the similarity renormalization scheme [3] the width of the band corresponds to
the uv cuto . the connection between the two quantities is given

l =

1
2

12

(2.30)

the matrix elements of the interactions, which change the fock state, are strongly suppressed,if
the energy dierence exceeds , while for the fock state conserving part of the hamiltonian
the matrix elements with all energy dierences are present. as the ow parameter l   (or
  0) the rest part is completely eliminated, except maybe for the matrix elements with
i = j. one is left with the block-diagonal eective hamiltonian.

generally, the ow equations are written

dhij
dl

= [, hd + hr]ij  (ei  ej)[hd, hr]ij +

ij = [hd, hr]ij +

1

ei  ej  

duij
dl

uij!

duij
dl

hij
uij

(2.31)

where the following condition on the cuto function in diagonal and rest sectors, respectively,
is imposed

udij = 1
urij = uij

(2.32)

one recovers with this condition the ow equations eq. (2.27) for both sectors. other unitary
transformations, which bring the hamiltonian to the block-diagonal form, with the fock state
conserving in each block are used [3]

and [4]

where uij +rij = 1; and the constrain eq. (2.32) on the cuto function in both sectors is implied.
one can choose the sharp cuto function uij = (  |ij|).

chapter 3

light-front eld theory

3.1 introduction

the development of light-front eld theory dates back to the work of dirac [11], where he
introduced the light-front coordinates (the coordinate vector is x = (x+, x, x) with x =
x0  x3 and x = (x1, x2)) and the concept of front form dynamics for hamiltonians. dirac
suggested, that a hamiltonian operator can propagate a physical system either in the usual
time x0 (instant form dynamics) or in the light-front time x+ (front form dynamics). the
latter form of relativistic dynamics combines the restricted principle of relativity with the
hamiltonian formulation of dynamics [11].

later the rules for front form perturbation theory were formulated [12], and the equivalence
of this theory with the feynman rules of covariant perturbation theory was established [13],[14].
recent interest in light-front coordinates is driven mainly by two topics: low-energy bound
state problem in qcd, where light-front coordinates oer a scenario in which a constituent
picture of hadron structure can emerge from qcd, because of the simplied vacuum on the
light-front [20], [31], [22]; and high-energy scattering processes, where light-front coordinates
are the natural coordinates of the system [49], [22]. for an extensive list of light-front references
through the early 1990s see [1], for the list of recent reviews see [21], [22] and references within.
below we give briey an introduction to light-front eld theory (for introduction see also

[23]).

light-front (lf) quantization is very similar to canonical equal time (et) quantization
(here we closely follow ref.
[15]). both are hamiltonian formulations of eld theory, where
one species the elds on a particular initial surface. the evolution of the elds o the initial
surface is determined by the lagrangian equations of motion. the main dierence is the choice
of the initial surface, x0 = 0 for et and x+ = 0 for the lf respectively. in both frameworks
states are expanded in terms of elds (and their derivatives) on this surface. therefore, the
same physical state may have very dierent wave functions1 in the et and lf approaches
because elds at x0 = 0 provide a dierent basis for expanding a state than elds at x+ = 0.
the reason is that the microscopic degrees of freedom  eld amplitudes at x0 = 0 versus eld
amplitudes at x+ = 0  are in general quite dierent from each other in the two formalisms.
from the purely theoretical point of view, various advantages of lf quantization derive from
properties of the ten generators of the poincare group (translations p , rotations ~l and boosts
~k) [15]. those generators which leave the initial surface invariant ( ~p and ~l for et and p,
~p, l3 and ~k for lf) are simple in the sense that they have very simple representations in

1by wave function we mean here the collection of all fock space amplitudes.

14

terms of the elds (typically just sums of single particle operators). the other generators, which
include the hamiltonians (p0, which is conjugate to x0 in et and p+, which is conjugate
to the lf-time x+ in lf quantization) contain interactions among the elds and are typically
very complicated. generators which leave the initial surface invariant are also called kinematic
generators, while the others are called dynamic generators. obviously it is advantageous to have
as many of the ten generators kinematic as possible. there are seven kinematic generators on
the lf but only six in et quantization.

the fact that p, the generator of x translations, is kinematic (obviously it leaves x+ = 0
invariant!) and positive has striking consequences for the lf vacuum[15]. for free elds p2 = m2
implies for the lf energy p+ = (m2 + ~p) /p. hence positive energy excitations have positive
p. after the usual re-interpretation of the negative energy states this implies that p for a
single particle is non-negative [which makes sense, considering that p = p0  p3]. p being
kinematic means that it is given by the sum of single particle momenta p. combined with
the non-negativity of p this implies that, even in the presence of interactions, the physical
vacuum (ground state of the theory) diers from the fock vacuum (no particle excitations)
only by so-called zero-mode excitations, i.e. by excitations of modes which are independent
of the longitudinal lf-space coordinate x. due to this simplied vacuum structure, the lf-
framework seems to be the only framework, where a constituent quark picture in a strongly
interacting relativistic eld theory has a chance to make sense [16, 17, 18, 19]. this is the most
attractive feature of lf-frame to approve constituent quark model desription for qcd.

3.2 preceding work

as far as progress is concerned, the light-front approach is not so far along; most research eort
has occurred since late 1980s [1]. progress is currently limited by conceptual issues, mainly by
problems in renormalization program.

further the methods available in the light-front eld theory to solve the bound state problem

are discussed. then the results for positronium problem on the light-front follow.

3.2.1 models and methods in the light-front eld theory

the ultimate goal of the light-front eld theory is to start with qcd lagrangian and, with
a minimum of approximation, calculate the hadron spectrum. the basic idea behind this ap-
proach is to use hamiltonian techniques in the coordinate system best suited for relativistic
dynamics. for light-front eld theory, physically interesting observables are quite easily calcu-
lated then from the bound state wave-functions.

further we review several methods to solve the bound state problem in the light-front eld

theory.

there are several attempts to solve for qcd bound states in the light-front approach,
based on simplication of initial qcd3+1 lagrangian. instead of real qcd3+1 dierent mod-
els, resembling qcd and having its main properties (connement, asymptotic freedom as in
transverse lattice model, and also chiral symmetry breaking as in collinear model) are solved.
collinear (tube) qcd model is a phenomenological model for light-front qcd, where the
transverse momenta of all constituents are neglected. this reduces the qcd3+1 lagrangian
to an eective 1 + 1 dimensional theory, which is then solved for the spectrum, distribution
amplitudes and form factors of mesons [25].

in the transverse lattice qcd approach one formulates an eective light-front hamiltonian

15

for su(n) yang mills theory in 2 + 1 [26] ((3 + 1) [27]) dimensions using two continuous space-
time dimensions with the remaining transverse space dimension (two transverse dimensions)
discretized on a lattice. in the case of (2 + 1) - dimensional theory the reduction to a (1 + 1) -
dimensional theory takes place, that enables to investigate the string tension and the glueball
spectrum.

the goal of such toy model studies is to build intuition which one can hopefully apply
to qcd3+1. however, while these models have been very useful for studing nonperturbative
renormalization in 1 + 1 dimesional lf eld theories, it is not clear to what extend these results
can be generalized to suciently nontrivial theories in 3 + 1 dimensions.

in other approaches one reduces the initial hamiltonian of light-front eld theory to an
eective, low-energy hamiltonian, which can be solved for bound states. dierent methods are
used to construct such an eective hamiltonian on the light-front.

first group of methods, known as tamm-danco approach, is based on tamm-danco
truncation [33] and projection technique in fock space (bloch-fleshbach technique). by tamm-
danco truncation one simply restricts the full fock space to several lowest fock sectors of
interest. the problem of renormalization arises in this approach, since in a limited fock space
the diagrams, needed for renormalization but containing more fock components in intermediate
state as allowed, inspite of it must be thrown away. the method of iterative resolvents developed
by pauli, together with discretized light cone quantization (dlcq) approach is the synthesis of
the methods from the rst group [28], [29]. in this approach one repeats projecting high fock
components upon the lower in sequence several times. thus constructed few-body eective
hamiltonian describes most adequately low-lying bound states. application of this method to
qed is discussed below.

second group of methods uses renormalization group concept to construct low-energy hamil-
tonian. similarity renormalization scheme [3], formulated by glazek and wilson, develops
a renormalization group and the basic elements of renormalization group calculations for
hamiltonians on the light-front. in this method continuous unitary transformation, similar-
ity transformation, is performed to bring the hamiltonian operator hij to a band-diagonal
form |ei  ej|  . it turns out, that the width of the band  corresponds to the energy scale
and plays the role of uv cuto, changing of which gives rise to renormalization group running
of hamiltonian. also new interactions, not present in canonical theory hamiltonian, appear
through this scaling.

the alternative approach for hamiltonian renormalization, the method of ow equations [2],
was proposed independently by wegner. one performs a set of innitesimal unitary transfor-
mations to get the block-diagonal eective hamiltonian, with the particle number conserving
in each block. this reduces the bound state problem to a few-body problem, since the particle
number violating contributions are eliminated.

there is a need for an eective formalism for gauge theories: nobody ever has solved rigor-

ously a relativistic many-body theory in 3 + 1 dimensions.

3.2.2 results for light front qed3+1

in this section we review the results obtained by others on positronium problem in the light
front dynamics. first we discuss the rst group of methods based on tamm-danco approach
(tamm-danco truncation and projection technique in fock space). the numerical recipes are
well elaborated there.

brodsky, pauli, and tang [32] showed how to set up the positronium bound state problem
in dlcq (discretized light cone quantization) with a tamm-danco truncation [33] to two

16

sectors of fock space: (i) the electron-positron sector, and (ii) the electron-positron-photon
sector. in order to solve the associated eigenvalue problem, the diagonalization of the discretized
hamiltonian, and variational methods were used. the leading results for the triplet ground
state of positronium were obtained not quit satisfactory. to produce signicant results by
diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix, one would have had to include much more fock states
or to improve the numerical convergence of the method applied.

krautgartner, pauli, and wolz [34] derived the continuum limit in the positronium model
discussed above for the calculation analytically, and with a prescription for handling an infrared
divergence they showed that to leading order the binding energy for positronium results. they
have used an eective interaction, obtained from a projecting of the |ee >-sector onto the
|ee >-sector. the corresponding eective integral equation was solved numerically using the
method of coulomb counterterms, introduced to improve numerical convergence. the results
obtained for bohr spectrum and hyperne splitting show an excellent convergence and coincide
with the expected values. for the rst time the relativistic eects as ne structure could be
investigated (numerically) in the light-front hamiltonian approach.

kaluza and pauli [35] showed that reasonably accurate numerical results can be obtained
with proper renormalization of the hamiltonian, although logarithmic divergences remain in
their calculations. these divergences are not a serious problem if one uses a suciently small
cuto and weak coupling. for calculation of ne structure the diagonalization technique was
improved to enlarge the fock space feasible with the computer. but the convergence of spectra
was rather poor, since no proper counterterms for the coulomb singularity of the relativistic
problem were taken.

kaluza and pirner extended the work in [34] through the ne structure [36].
pauli formulated the method of iterative resolvents [28], which enables, in general, to take
into account innite many high fock states by projecting in sequence high fock sectors unto the
lower fock sectors. the main advantage of the method is, that it requires the inversion of the
eective sector hamiltonians, corresponding to the given fock sectors, at each step of iteration,
instead of inversion of the full hamiltonian matrix, standing in the bound state equation.
to avoid in the leading order the infrared divergences (collinear singularities) the full energy
appeared in the interaction kernel for the electron-positron bound state was replaced with a
free energy. in the physical amplitudes the collinear singularities are exactly cancelled by the
dynamical terms [45]. pauli and trittmann have solved numerically the corresponding light-
front integral equation for positronium bound state in the continuum limit [30], including the
coulomb counterterm technique in the computer code. the results show excellent convergence
and coincide to a high degree of accuracy with the expected values.

renormalization program for positronium in the light-front qed was performed using sim-
ilarity renormalization scheme (similarity transformation and coupling coherence) by several
authors. perry has shown [37] that the resultant eective hamiltonian leads to standard lowest
order bound state results, with the coulomb interaction emerging naturally.

for the rst time jones,perry, and glazek [39] presented using similarity renormalization
a systematic analytic calculation in a light-front hamiltonian approach of the singlet-triplet
spin splitting in the ground state of positronium through order 4. the standard singlet-triplet
splitting of positronium was obtained with degeneracy of triplet state, that recovers rotational
symmetry that is non-manifest symmetry in the light-front eld theory.

dominant part of the splitting between the 2s 1

jones, and perry have calculated also the lamb shift in the same approach [40]. the
energy levels in hydrogen was obtained.
all calculations in similarity renormalization approach were done within the perturbative

2

and 2p 1

theory and results for spectrum were obtained with several approximations analytically.

we do not mention here applications of both methods, tamm-danco approach [41] and

similarity renormalization [20], to bound state problem for light-front qcd.

3.3 canonical qed hamiltonian

in this section we write the canonical qed3+1 hamiltonian in the light-front gauge and also
give briey its derivation from lagrangian density, following the original work of zhang and
harindranath [24]. the qed hamiltonian in the secondary quantization is given further, which
is used in the main part of the work (in the chapters 4,5,7).

boundary. a careful treatment of the denition of 1/+ is necessary. a suitable denition of

in practice, we dene the inverse longitudinal derivative in momentum space. we explic-
itly put the momentum representation of the eld operators into the respective terms of the
hamiltonian, multiply the elds out explicitly, and then replace the inverse derivatives by ap-
propriate factors of longitudinal momentum with the restriction |p+|/p +   = 0+ [p + is the
total longitudinal momentum of the physical state of interest]. the absolute value sign on |p+|
is required for the instantaneous interactions. for example, a product of two elds gives

hamiltonian bound state problem on
the light-front

in this chapter we outline the program we follow to solve the bound state problem on the
light-front. this includes two issues: the derivation of eective hamiltonian and solving the
corresponding bound state equation. the rst point is discussed here explicitly in application
to positronium bound state problem. the methods to solve bound state equation (analytically
and numerically) are discussed in the next chapters.

4.1 introduction

we use the method of ow equations to construct an eective hamiltonian starting from the
light-front formulation which can be used to solve the bound state problem. the physical idea
behind this approach is to use renormalization concept for hamiltonians to get an eective,
low-energy hamiltonian for a limited fock space. the bound state problem is reduced then to
a few-body problem with the eective hamiltonian acting on the energy scale of bound state
formation.

the key to renormalization of hamiltonians is to diagonalize the hamiltonian operator [3].
we have discussed briey in chapter 2 the methods to diagonalize hamiltonians continuously,
suggested by wegner [2] and glazek and wilson [3], which have been called ow equations and
similarity renormalization by the authors, resp.

it is common to both methods that they eliminate by means of a unitary transformation
initially the o-diagonal matrix elements between states with large energy dierences and con-
tinue with states closer and closer in energy, so that o-diagonal matrix elements between states
of energy dierence larger than  are eliminated or strongly suppressed. the nal aim is to
eliminate them completely (  0) and to obtain a diagonalized hamiltonian.
we have mentioned in chapter 3, that a literal use of this concept can lead to convergence
problems [2]. as was suggested by wegner [2], one may leave the idea of diagonalizing immedi-
ately in favor of block-diagonalizing. if matrix-elements between states of equal particle num-
ber are considered diagonal, then the procedure brings the hamiltonian into a block-diagonal
form. application of ow equations to an n-orbital model has shown, that procedure of block-
diagonalizing works much better, where block-diagonalization with respect to the quasiparticle
number (number of electrons above the fermi edge plus number of holes below the fermi edge)
is performed [2].

it becomes apparent from the calculations by jones, perry and glazek [39] on the basis of

23

the similarity transformation, that this scheme works well down to energy dierences of the
order of rydberg, but if one goes below, then contributions in higher orders in the coupling
become important.

indeed it seems to be rather dicult to obtain bound states from plane waves by continuous
unitary transformations. in eliminating only the terms which do not conserve the number of
particles one postpones the diagonalization, but reduces the problem to one in the space of
xed particle number [46]. thus for the positronium problem it is sucient to determine the
one- and two-particle contribution of the hamiltonian for electrons and positrons.

basically the procedure is very similar to that of the elimination of the electron-phonon
interaction [10] which yields an eective attractive interaction between electrons responsible
for superconductivity. both the method of ow equations and the similarity remormalization
[10] (the ref. to a. mielke) yield results dierent from frohlichs original ones [52] but in very
good agreement with more sophisticated methods. in qed it is the interaction of the electrons
with the photons instead of the phonons which has to be eliminated.

a basic advantage of the methods of similarity renormalization and ow equations in com-
parison to conventional perturbation theory is, that one obtains normally less singular eective
interactions.

this procedure is similar to the tamm-danco fock space truncation [33, 30] in the sense

that also in this truncation particle number changing interactions are eliminated.

we dene an eective hamiltonian

h ef f  uhu +

(4.1)

where h is the bare hamiltonian and the unitary transformation u is determined by the ow
equations below.

4.2 flow equations in the perturbative frame

in chapter 2 we have set up the framework to use ow equations in the eld theory. in this
section we formulate the equations, obtained in chapter 2, for a canonical qed hamiltonian in
the perturbative frame.
flow equations read

dh(l)

dl

= [(l), h(l)]

(l) = [hd(l), hr(l)]

(4.2)

where the hamiltonian is given h = hd + hr, with hd and hr including all the terms from
the diagonal and the rest sectors, resp.

our goal is to transform the hamiltonian into blocks with the same number of (quasi)-
particles. this means, that we dene the diagonal part hd as the part of the interaction
which conserves the number of particles (electrons, positrons, photons), and the rest hr as
the particle number changing part.
in the case of qed(qcd), where the electron-photon
(quark-gluon) coupling is present, the number of photons (gluons) is conserved in each block
of the nal eective hamiltonian.

as a result of the unitary transformation new interactions are induced (see below). they
are absent at l = 0 and are generated as l increases. they also give rise to new terms in the
generator of transformation (l). this in its turn generates new interactions again.

24

to be able to perform the calculations analytically we proceed in a perturbative frame
and truncate the series assuming the coupling constant is small. in the case of qed on the
light-front one has for any nite value of l

h(l) = h (0)

d + h (1)

r + h (2)

d + h (2)

r + ...

(4.3)

where the superscript denotes the order in the bare coupling constant, h (n)  en; the in-
dices d and r indicate the diagonal and the rest parts correspondingly. the part h (0)
is
d
the free hamiltonian, corresponding to the single particle energies with the structure in sec-
ondary quantization a+a, b+b, d+d, where a, b, d are the annihilation operators of the photons,
electrons and positrons correspondingly; h (1)
denotes the electron-photon coupling (of the
type a+b+b); h (2)
is the second order diagonal part of the hamiltonian, having the structure
d
b+d+bd, b+b+bb, d+d+dd (in the light front they correspond to the canonical instantaneous (seag-
ull) and to newly generated interactions in the diagonal sector in second order). note, that the
diagonal part in the ow equations is not only the free hamiltonian but the full particle number
conserving part of the eective hamiltonian. the choice of only h (0)
d as the diagonal part gives
rise to the band-diagonal structure of the eective hamiltonian in each particle number sector
in the similarity renormalization scheme [53]. however, this makes a dierence for the diagonal
part only if one goes beyond third order in e.

note, that though in general the commutator [[h (0)

the ow equation due to the denition of the diagonal part. the corresponding commutator
[[h (0)
d ] in the non-diagonal sector insures the band-diagonal form for the rest in-
teraction and also gives rise to the dierent structure of the generated interaction (the integral
term) in the rest and diagonal sectors.

the commutator [(1), h (1)] gives rise to new terms in second order in the bare coupling

group corrections to the electron (photon) masses. the coupling constant starts to run in third
order in e.

4.3 eective low-energy hamiltonian

4.3.1 eective electron-positron interaction

in this section we follow mainly the work [53]. we calculate by means of ow equations the
eective interaction between electron and positron, generated in the second order in coupling
e by elimination of electron-photon vertex. we use the canonical qed hamiltonian on the
light-front in second quantization, given in chapter 3.

eeee eq. (3.7),eq. (3.8) of the canonical light-
front qed hamiltonian. the order of the eld operators in both interactions satises the
prescription of standard feynmann rules in the |ee > sector.
we note, that generated interaction eq. (4.20) is a new interaction, induced by ow equations
in the second order in coupling, and corresponds to the dynamical photon exchange; while the

27

instantaneous term eq. (4.21) enters the canonical light-front qed hamiltonian and describes
the instant photon exchange. instantaneous term is special for the light-front calculations 1.

to the leading (second) order we neglect the l dependence of the energies (which start to
run in the second order in coupling constant, see chapter 7) in the interactions, that enables to
write the ow equations for the corresponding couplings.

stantaneous and generated interactions) orders are

ment < [(1)(l), hee] >|ee> is understood as the corresponding commutator between the free
electron-positron states, namely < p3s3, p4s4|...|p1s1, p2s2 >. in the order o(e2) there is also
the contribution of the commutator < [(1), hee] > to the free hamiltonian in one-electron and
one-photon sectors, that denes the renormalization of electron and photon masses, resp., (see
chapter 7). renormalization group running of both (instantaneous and generated) interactions
starts in the order o(e4), and the electron-photon coupling starts to run in the order o(e3).

neglecting the dependence of the light-front energies on the ow parameter l (that is the

corrections of higher orders), the solution of eq. (4.24) reads

tions can be found in appendix a. in what follows we use the notations of this appendix.

[10]. they used equal time canonical electron-phonon hamiltonian known from bcs-theory. the elimination
of electron-phonon interaction by the ow equations generates a new interaction between electrons, that denes
an eective electron-electron interaction. this eective interaction leads to the leading coulomb behavior.

where we sum over exchange and annihilation channels.

in the chapters 5 and 6 we use the eective electron-positron interaction eq. (4.39) to

calculate positronium mass spectrum.

in the next section we outline the general computational strategy to solve for bound states

of positronium using an eective hamiltonian.

4.3.2 positronium model (general computational strategy)

in this section we give the program to solve positronium bound state problem in the light-front
dynamics. this approach can be applied also to the other systems.

required that the particle number (fock state) conserving terms in the hamiltonian were
considered to be diagonal and the other terms o-diagonal an eective hamiltonian was ob-
tained which is block-diagonal in particle number (fock) space. this means, that the diagonal
sectors are decoupled, since the particle number (fock state) violating contributions are elim-
inated, and one is able then to truncate the full fock space in the eective hamiltonian to
the lowest fock sectors of interest. the bound state problem is reduced then to a few-particle
hamiltonian problem. sure, this is true to the given order of perturbation theory. this is the
idea of the approach.

below we illustrate schematically this procedure for the case of light-front qed, where the

positronium bound state problem is reduced to a two-particle problem.

we start with the light front schrodinger equation for the positronium model

hlc|n >= m 2

n|n >

(4.40)

where hlc = p p is the invariant mass (squared) operator, referred for convenience to as
the light front hamiltonian of positronium and |n > being the corresponding eigenfunction;
n labels all the quantum numbers of the state.
the canonical hamiltonian of the system hlc contains innitely many fock sectors (i.e.
one has for the positronium wave function |n >= cee|(ee)n > +cee|(ee)n > +cee|(ee)n >
+...) and each fock sector contains states with arbitrarily large energies. we now
(1) introduce the bare cuto (regularization) with the result h b() - the bare hamiltonian;
(2) perform the unitary transformation by means of ow equations with the result h ef f -

the eective renormalized hamiltonian (table 1 for nite value of );

eective, renormalized hamiltonian acting in the electron-positron sector.

(3) truncate the fock space to the lowest fock sector (|ee >) with the result h ef f - the
then the eigenvalue equation reads

h ef f|(ee)n >= m 2

n|(ee)n > .

(4.41)

the eective light front hamiltonian consists of the free (noninteracting) part and the eective
electron-positron interaction

h ef f = h (0) + v ef f

(4.42)

31

the light front equation eq. (4.41) is then expressed by the integral equation (the coordinates
are given in g.(4)

; s3, s4|v ef f|x, ~k; s1, s2 > n(x, ~k; s1, s2) = 0

(4.43)

the kernel of this equation, the eective electron-positron interaction v ef f , was obtained in
the previous section, eq. (4.39). note, that the eective interaction v ef f , present in eq. (4.43),
is boost invariant (i.e. does not depend on p +). the integration domain d in eq. (4.43) is
restricted by the covariant cuto condition [45]

m2 + ~k2


x(1  x)  2 + 4m2

which allows for states which have a kinetic energy below the cuto .

(4.44)

in the chapter 5 we solve eigenvalue equation eq. (4.41) analytically, using the bound state
perturbation theory. in the chapter 6 we solve the corresponding integral equation eq. (4.43)
numerically, using the numerical methods elaborated in tamm-danco approach and discussed
in the section 3.2.2.

we have considered here |ee >-sector. in the next section we consider extended fock space
to give diagrammatic representation of the eective hamiltonian, obtained in the second order
in e.

4.3.3 eective, renormalized qed hamiltonian

in this section we review diagrammatic rules for the eective hamiltonian, obtained by ow
equations in the second order in e. it is useful to represent hamiltonian matrix elements in
the form of table, consisting of dierent fock blocks, each of them has innite many matrix
elements describing the transition between corresponding fock states and with innite many
energy dierences (table 1). in this representation the canonical eld theory hamiltonian on
the light-front has denite structure, that is simpler than that in equal-time formalism. on
the light-front the vacuum does not uctuate. this means, that only one- and two-particle
transitions are possible, three- and more-particle transitions are absent. in the case of qed
on the light-front one-particle transitions are dened by the electron-photon interaction and
two-particle transitions are given by the instantaneous interactions. kinetic energy term is
diagonal in fock space representation, also there are instantaneous terms that does not change
particle number. the canonical qed hamiltonian has therefore pentadiagonal structure in this
representation [28].

now consider the eective qed hamiltonian. we do not include instantaneous diagrams,
since the ow equations do not change them to the second order in coupling. we start with the
situation, when the rest (fock state changing) sector consists of matrix elements of electron-
photon vertex, and the diagonal (fock state conserving) sector has matrix elements of kinetic
terms for electron and photon. we perform the unitary transformation to eliminate the rest
sector. in the second order in e the elimination of electron-photon vertex generates one- and
two-particle operators. the elimination of rest sector in the next orders in e generates many-
particle operators.

32

the matrix elements of the eective hamiltonian, obtained by ow equations in the second
order in e, namely the diagrams in dierent fock sectors are depicted in table 1. dot denote
the zero in the second order matrix elements. corresponding analytic expressions for the
matrix elements in diagonal and rest sectors are listed in g.(2). the diagrammatic rules
are obtained by direct calculation of matrix elements between free particle states. we consider
the situation with nite . the matrix elements of the rest sectors are squeezed in the energy

band pipf = |p pi p pf | < ; there are matrix elements with all energy dierences in
diagonal sector. as   0 the rest sector is completely eliminated to the given order of
perturbation theory. one ends up with the block-diagonal eective hamiltonian, where in each
block the fock state is conserved.

for completenes we give below the matrix elements of eective interactions in dierent
fock sectors, generated by the ow equations in the second order in coupling constant. the
transitions between fock states and corresponding matrix elements are given, resp.,
in the diagonal sectors

where dots denote the higher fock sectors; one obtains the next higher fock sector, when in the

in eq. (4.45),eq. (4.46) to get the explicit form of interactions in both sectors listed in g.(2).
rest diagrams are drawn schematically to show the dierence between the interactions in
diagonal and rest sectors. namely, for the rest sectors we imply, that the corresponding
momentum exchange must be done in the diagrams of g.(2) to get analytical expressions for
diagrams depicted in table 1.

in the second order ow equations give rise to the mass corrections in one-particle sector.
it turns out that the electron, photon mass corrections are equal, but have the opposite sign,

33

to the standard electron, photon self energy terms, obtained in the light-front perturbation
theory. we consider this explicitly in the chapter 7. in order to make the diagrammatic rules
complete we include mass diagram for the photon in the table (sector | > | >). after the
unitary transformation is performed the electron (photon) mass depends on the cuto

m2

0   ,

(4.48)

where  is the self energy term (m0 = 0 for a photon), and subscript 0 denotes the bare mass.
in the third order the coupling constant gets the cuto dependence, i.e. e = e0(1 + o(e2
)),
that is beyond our consideration.

the two-component lf theory, introduced by zhang and harindranath [24], as compared
to four-component formalism of brodsky and lepage, is formulated purely in terms of physical
degrees of freedom; so that each term in the eective, renormalized hamiltonian corresponds
to a real dynamical process (or give renormalization term). dierent diagonal sectors of the
eective hamiltonian contribute to: in | > sector - to self energy photon operator, in |ee >
sector - to electron-positron bound state (or corresponding scattering process), in | > sector
- to light-light scattering, in |ee > sector - to compton scattering, et. cetera (see table 1).
in the previous section we considered this formalism in application to the positronium bound
state problem.

chapter 5

positronium spectrum (analytically)

in this chapter we solve an eective eigenvalue equation for positronium, obtained in the pre-
vious chapter, analytically. we perform the bound state calculations perturbatively. the idea
of calculations is the following. we split an eective hamiltonian h ef f into h (0), a part which
is solved nonperturbatively, and v , the dierence between the original hamiltonian and h (0).
the eects of v are to be computed using bound state perturbation theory. the criteria for
choosing h (0) is that it approximates the physics relevant for the given bound states (positron-
ium in our case) as closely as possible. as a consequence, h (0) contributes the dominant term to
the mass spectrum and the bound state perturbation theory converges with respect to v /h (0).
for qed, where the analytic answer is known, the leading order solution h (0) is simply given
by a sum of kinetic terms and the coulomb potential. this result arise straightforward from
the form of the eective electron-positron hamiltonian in the nonrelativistic limit. for more
complicated theories as qcd the hint to choose h (0) comes from phenomenological models.

in the next section we dene explicitly bound state perturbation theory for positronium
system. the calculation of bohr spectrum and the ground state spin-splittings is given further.
in analytical calculations of singlet-triplet spin-splitting we follow the work [39].

5.1 bound state perturbative theory (bspt)

first introduce instead of the light front parameterization g.(3), used before for the single-
particle momenta, the instant form. we express the variable (x, ~) in terms of the equal-time
variable ~p = (pz, ~) as

x =

pz~p2 + m2!

1

2 1 +

~p2 = p2

z + ~2


and similarly for x and ~p

2 as function of p



z.

the jacobian of this transformation, j(p), is

j(p) =

dx
dpz

=

2
 + m2

2(~p2 + m2)3/2 .

the instant form is used for practical purposes:

it is simpler to recover the rotational

symmetry there, the symmetry that is not manifest in the light-front frame.

we choose the leading order hamiltonian operator for positronium

h (0) = h + vcoul ,

(5.4)

35

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

where h is the free part (sum of corresponding kinetic terms) and vcoul is the coulomb interac-
tion

vcoul =

.

let us solve the corresponding schrodinger equation on the light-front

h (0)|n (p ) >= en|n (p ) > ,

(5.5)

(5.6)

where p is the positronium momentum. the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for positronium
bound state on the light-front are dened in a standard way

further we use the matrix elements of v , that are dened as

we remind that tilde above the interaction terms denotes the rescaled potential (v = v /p +2),
that does not depend on the total momentum p +, i.e. is invariant under the light-front boosts.

5.3 positroniums ground state spin splitting

in this section we use the eective electron-positron interaction eq. (5.25) to calculate the ground
state singlet-triplet splitting for positronium. we follow the work [39], where the similarity
renormalization scheme was used to get an eective electron-positron interaction.

there is an important dierence between the two approaches, ow equations and similarity
transformation. flow equations eliminate the matrix elements between states with large energy
dierences (|ei  ej| > , where  is an eective uv-cuto), but only for those blocks that
change the number of quasiparticles. the value of  =    corresponds to the initial
bare hamiltonian, a nite  determines the eective hamiltonian at an intermediate stage, for
 = 0 the elimination of the particle number changing sectors is complete and the eective
hamiltonian is block-diagonal in particle number. one can work then in a few (or even one)
lowest fock sectors.

the eective hamiltonian, obtained by the similarity transformation, is band-diagonal in the
energy space. 1 the width of the band  (namely 2/p +) introduces the articial parameter
in the procedure, which must be adjusted from the physical reasoning. the eective uv-cuto
must be low enough to neglect the contribution of high fock states, but is restricted from below
to stay in perturbation theory region. in the case of positronium the window of opportunity
is simple to choose, since there are two dynamical energy scales in qed, m22
p + , that is
one of the reasons why qed calculations have been always so successful. namely one chooses
m22 << 2 << m2, and the eective electron-positron interaction does not depend on  and
is dened on the energy scale of positronium bound state formation [39]. in the case of qcd,
unfortunately, there is no such window, and the procedure of tting the cuto seems to be
nontrivial [20]. in the case of ow equations elimination of particle number changing sectors
can be performed completely, so that there is no articial parameter (as eective uv-cuto)
left in the eective hamiltonian.

p + and m2

we use the potential eq. (5.17), that appears in the nonrelativistic schrodinger equation for
positronium eq. (5.13), and denes the nonrelativistic binding energy bn (m 2
n  4m2+4mbn ).
the eective electron-positron interaction eq. (5.25) has the following form in the nonrelativistic

can drop in n1, except for the leading order term o(1), the diagonal part in spin space. also

reproduced the coulomb potential, dened before as the leading order term in bspt.

we combine this expression with the kinetic term from the schrodinger equation, eq. (5.13),

and write it in the form

here the potential v (r) plays a dierent role in the two terms. in the rst term, corresponding
to kinetic energy, it generates an eective mass of the electron, which depends on the relative
position and manifests the non-locality of the interaction. the second term is the usual potential

brisudova and perry [42] tried to bring the eective light-front hamiltonian of positronium,
obtained in the second order in coupling by similarity transformation, to the rotational invariant
form. they succeeded to get the correct spin-spin interactions, namely they obtained the
familiar breit-fermi spin-spin and tensor terms. they failed to reproduce the standard (equal-
time) spin-orbit interaction using the eective hamiltonian in the order o(e2). the reason can
be the following.

each spin enters the electron-positron interaction with a factor of order q/m as compared
to the leading coulomb interaction, that is of order q2. thus the two-spin interaction enters
only in the order q0 or higher. the only contribution to ne structure splitting, 4, comes from
order e2 (from the terms e2q0). the same holds for the spin-triplet splitting (which is quadratic
in the spin), discussed above. the contributions to the spin-orbit coupling are of the order q1.
in the order 4 also term e4q2 is important, its contribution to the mass spectrum in order 4
must be considered together with the contribution of e2q1 term. to get the correct spin-orbit
splittings one has to derive the eective interaction to the order e4.

spin independent interaction is of order q2 and contain also subleading terms in q (q1, q0).
the spin-independent term e2q0 contribute to the ne structure splitting, in the order 4. in
this order also terms of order e4q1 and e6q2 are important. thus to obtain all contributions
of order 4 one has to consider the eective interaction in order e2, e4 and e6.

chapter 6

positronium spectrum (numerically)

this part of the work is done in collaboration with dr. u.trittmann. in this chapter we suggest
the form of the eective electron-positron interaction, that preserves the rotational symmetry
(at least on the level of the mass spectrum). using this interaction the light-front integral
equation for positronium bound states is solved numerically1.

6.1 light-front bound state equation

the eective light-front eigenvalue equation for positronium bound states reads (see subsection
4.3.2)

h ef f|(ee)n >= m 2

n|(ee)n > .

(6.1)

where n labels all quantum numbers, and the eective light-front hamiltonian consists of the
free (noninteracting) part and the eective electron-positron interaction

h ef f = h (0) + v ef f

(6.2)

note, that the rescaled value (that does not depend on p +) of the eective electron-positron
interaction, obtained in the chapter 4, stands in eq. (6.1),eq. (6.2). the integral light-front
equation in the momentum space, corresponding to eq. (6.1), is given

in order to introduce the spectroscopic notation for positronium mass spectrum we integrate
out the angular degree of freedom , where ~k = k(cos , sin ), by substituting it with the
discrete quantum number jz = n, n  z (actually for the annihilation channel only |jz|  1 is

momentum l, and total spin s.
it should be noted that the denition of angular momen-
tum operators in light-front dynamics is problematic because they include the interaction (see
introduction in the chapter 3).

we proceed now to solve for the positronium spectrum in all sectors of jz. we formulate
therefore the light-front integral equation eq. (6.3) in the form where the integral kernel is given
by the eective interaction for the total momentum jz eq. (6.6). after the change of variables

6.2 brodsky-lepage prescription of the light-front dy-

namics: eective electron-positron interaction

in this section we write the eective electron-positron interaction, using the light-front prescrip-
tion as formulated by brodsky and lepage [45]. the problem in the light-front eld theory
is, that parity and rotational invariance are not manifest symmetries, leaving the possibility
that approximations or incorrect renormalization (in our case not gauge invariant regulariza-
tion) might lead to violations of these symmetries for physical observables. the formulation
for light-front eld theory of brodsky, lepage is for practical use, since it enables to pick up
the rotation violating part in the electron-positron interaction and to cancel its contribution in
the mass spectrum.

in what follows we write the second order solution of the ow equations in a useful for
our calculations form (subsection 6.2.1) and exploit it below to calculate the eective electron-
positron interaction, using brodsky-lepage prescription of light-front qed (subsection 6.2.2).

6.2.1 first and second order solutions of the ow equations

in this section we express the solutions of the ow equations in the rst and second orders of
perturbation theory through the similarity function. the similarity function denes the rate
how fast the rest sectors are eliminated with the ow parameter l (or eective uv-cuto );
exact denition is given below.

we consider the ow equations, written in the form eq. (2.31)

h = h0d +xn

where h (n)  en, e is the bare coupling constant (here we do not refer to the denite eld
theory). to the order of n in coupling constant the ow equations in both sectors are given

  0 f() = 0) as the cuto function u().

6.2.2 eective electron-positron interaction

the exchange channel brings the dominant contribution to the mass spectrum. we focus
therefore on the electron-positron interaction in the exchange channel. we use eq. (6.19) to
calculate the generated electron-positron interaction in the second order in e.

e4q1 and e6q2 are important. these terms arise from the next orders transformation of both
electron-photon vertex and also instantaneous term. since the coulomb interaction, that is
the only spin-independent part of electron-positron interaction, arise from g term in the
eective interaction v ef f , we expect that the spin-independent  term in the order e2q0
will be compensated in the mass spectrum by the corresponding terms of the order e4 and e6.
compare eective electron-positron interaction eq. (6.38), generated in the second order in
e by ow equations, with the electron-positron interaction arising from perturbative photon
exchange. the electron-positron interaction in the light-front perturbation theory is given by
a sum of dynamical photon exchange v phot and the instantaneous interaction, v p t = v phot +
v inst. the instantaneous term is given by eq. (6.37), and the v phot term, dened by the diagram
with one photon exchange, is [45]

given the eq. (6.50), the instantaneous interaction v inst eq. (6.37), which is the source of
infrared divergences, is precisely canceled by the part in v phot corresponding to emission and

where the condition eq. (6.49) (eq. (6.50)) is imposed. this is the remarkable result, that shows
that specifying the unitary transformation in a proper way one can get rid of  term in the
eective interaction eq. (6.38), the term that causes the infrared divergences in longitudinal
direction.
in all other cases we need to introduce the symmetric cuto condition eq. (6.33)
(eq. (6.34)) on q+ to cancel the divergent contribution in physical observables.

what is the status of  term in the eective electron-positron interaction v ef f eq. (6.38)?
the  term describes instant emission and absorption of longitudinal photon and is specic
in the light-front gauge computations. as was discussed above, this term is not desirable in the
electron-positron interaction and can be considered as a consequence of the unitary transfor-
mation performed. the physical reason for its appearance is the violation of lorenz and gauge
symmetries by the derivation of the eective, renormalized hamiltonian. the rst problem in
the light-front eld theory is that whenever the generator of a symmetry is dynamical (contains
interactions) it is somewhere between very dicult and impossible to monitor and maintain
that symmetry at each step of a calculation - unless of course one can solve the theory ex-
actly. this concerns parity and rotational invariance, that are not manifest symmetries on the
light-front. the second problem is that whenever we use the hamiltonian technique, the naive
regularization by introducing the cutos breaks the gauge invariance (and also lorenz covari-
ance), and forces the bare hamiltonian to contain a larger than normal suite of counterterms

54

to enable a nite limit as the cutos are removed. one way is, that the counterterms are then
adjusted to reproduce physical observables and to restore the symmetries broken by cutos.
the other way is to nd the gauge invariant procedure for regularization of hamiltonians. the
attempt in the latter direction was made by brodsky, hiller, and mccartor [47]. solving the
yukawa theory they have tried to preserve more symmetries by using pauli-villars procedure
for regularization.

in the next section we use the eective electron-positron interaction v ef f eq. (6.38), namely

its g part, to calculate mass spectrum and wave functions for positronium.

equal to the cuto function f (x) = u(x), the eective electron-positron interaction reads

gauss-legendre algorithm (gaussian quadratures). to improve the numerical convergence the
technique of coulomb counterterms is included. the problem has been solved for all components
of the total angular momentum, jz. since we calculate the values of an invariant mass squared,
a strong coupling constant  = 0, 3 has been chosen. the latter means also, that the method
of ow equations is applicable in non-perturbative regime. we get the ionization threshold
at m 2  4m2, the bohr spectrum, and what is more important, the ne structure. the
agreement is quantitative (for the lowest eigenvalues), particularly for the physical value of the
ne structure constant  = 1

the gure (5) is the summary of the spectra for dierent components of the total angular
momentum, jz. as one can see, certain mass eigenvalues at jz = 0 are degenerate with certain
eigenvalues at other jz to a very high degree of numerical precision. as an example, consider
the second lowest eigenvalue for jz = 0. it is degenerate with the lowest eigenvalue for jz = 1,
and can thus be classied as a member of the triplet with j = 1. correspondingly, the lowest
eigenvalue for jz = 0 having no companion can be classied as the singlet state with j = 0.
quite in general one can interpret 2jz,max + 1 degenerate multiplets as members of a state with
total angular momentum j. one can get the quantum number of total angular momentum
j from the number of degenerate states for a xed eigenvalue m 2
n. such form of spectrum is
driven by rotational invariance. it is a remarkable result, we restore the rotational symmetry
in the light-front positronium calculations on the level of mass spectrum.

the integral equation is approximated by gaussian quadratures, and the results are studied
as a function of the number of integration points n, as displayed in figures (6) and (7). on
the g.(6) the mass squared eigenvalues m 2
n for jz = 0 are shown as functions of the number
of integration points n = n1 = n2. one sees, that the results stabilize themselves quickly.
to nd out if the degeneracy obtained is merely a numerical artifact, or a property of the
positronium model, consider g.(7). the mass (squared) discrepancy between the jz = 0 and
jz = 1 eigenvalues is plotted versus the number of integration points n for three dierent
states. it is important, that the convergence of the value m 2(13s1) with n occurs. but the
mass gap does not converge to zero, rather to some small value  105. the mass gap for
21p1 state vanishes as n increases, while for 23p1 state m 2 converges again to a nite small
number  104. kaluza and pirner [36] and trittmann and pauli [30] found that in light-front
perturbation theory there is a discrepancy between the case of jz = 0 and jz = 1.

renormalization in the light-front qed

7.1 introduction.

in this section we consider the renormalization group problem for light-front qed, arising rst
in the second order in coupling. renormalization in the light-front eld theory is much more
complicated than in covariant feynman perturbation theory, and is nontrivial already in the
leading order for qed. generally, there are three renormalization problems that are signaled
by the divergence of the free energy:
(1) ~p2
;
(2) p+  0;
(3) p+ = 0.

the divergences from (1) are ultraviolet (uv), producing counterterms that are local
in the transverse direction. while the counterterm structure is richer than what is required
in manifestly covariant perturbation theory, in perturbative regime one has that masses are
relevant operators, and other gauge interactions are marginal.

the divergences from (2) are infrared (ir), producing counterterms that are nonlocal at
least in the longitudinal direction and which may also be nonlocal in the transverse direction.
these infrared divergences do not appear in feynman perturbation theory in covariant gauges.
they must cancel perturbatively for gauge invariant matrix elements in qed. coupling co-
herence xes the infrared divergent part of the hamiltonian as a power series in the gauge
coupling, allowing us to next consider re-summations that preserve cancellation of all infrared
divergences.

finally, (3) is the vacuum problem, that we do not consider here. the light-front vacuum is
trivial, except for zero modes. the light-front gauge a+ = 0 has a singularity at longitudinal
momentum p+ = 0, i.e. the zero-modes p+ = 0 should be treated specially, that is called the
problem of zero-modes. one can connect (3) and (2), but we ignore the problem of zero modes
in qed (at least here).

in light-front renormalization group transverse and longitudinal directions scale separately,
and transverse scaling runs the cuto. we assume transverse locality and identify relevant
and marginal operators using power counting, which is valid in the perturbative regime. the
longitudinal scale is not important for the perturbative classication of operators. this means,
that entire functions of longitudinal momenta (their dimensionless ratios), including any longi-
tudinal momentum scale introduced by cuto, appear in the relevant and marginal operators.
the simplest way to adjust the new operators is to x broken by the cuto covariance (lorenz
covariance) and gauge invariance in physical observables. generally, innite number of coun-

58

teterms must be added to the hamiltonian to restore these symmetries in observables, and to
obtain nite results. as a result, the renormalizability and as a consequence predictive power
of the theory seem to be problematic.

coupling coherence, developed by perry and wilson [44], says how to deal in practice with
the functions that appear in marginal and relevant light-front operators and how to reduce the
number (innite number) of couplings, that arise by renormalization scaling when the sym-
metries of the theory (rotational and gauge invariance) are broken by cutos. we demand
that these additional counterterms required to restore the symmetries run coherently with the
canonical renormalizable couplings - that is we do not allow them to explicitly depend on the
cuto but only implicitly through the canonical renormalizable couplings dependences on the
cuto. in other words, coupling coherence provides the condition under which a nite num-
ber of running variables determines the renormalization group trajectory of the renormalized
hamiltonian. also it is conjectured that coupling coherence restores (or reveal) symmetries
broken by the regulator or vacuum.

coupling coherent hamiltonian written in terms of dimensionless couplings for  << 

satises
h = u(, )h(, e, m, w, c(e, m))u +(, )  h(, e, m, w(e, m), c(e, m))

(7.1)

where u(, ) is the unitary transformation dened by ow equations. the additional require-
ment to eq. (7.1) is that all dependent couplings (represented by c in the argument of the
hamiltonians) vanish when the independent marginal couplings are set to zero. in eq. (7.1), e
and m are independent dimensionless marginal and relevant couplings, respectively; w rep-
resents the innite set of independent dimensionless irrelevant couplings; c(e, m) represents
the innite set of dependent dimensionless relevant, marginal and irrelevant couplings. more
about classication of couplings see [44].

the initial bare hamiltonian h does not satisfy eq. (7.1) a priori, its form changes under
the action of transformation u(, ).h must be adjusted until its form does not change.
this adjustment is the process of renormalization. coupling coherence is a highly nontrivial
constraint on the theory and to date has only been solved perturbatively. further we present
the solution of eq. (7.1) for qed in the second order in coupling (we calculate the electron and
photon mass operators), that turns out to be simple because coupling constant does not run
until the third order.

in the second order in coupling the program we proceed to nd renormalized electron and

photon masses is the following:
(1) regularize the canonical light-front qed hamiltonian. in this case, we introduce the bare
cuto , that regulates the divergences in transverse direction, and introduce the second order
mass counterterm m (2)
 , where m is
the mass term in free hamiltonian h0;
(2) perform the unitary transformation u(, ). the second-order change in the hamiltonian
is given in eq. (4.14) (section 4.2), which gives in one-body sector the shift to the electron
(photon) mass

 . we start with the bare cuto mass m2

 = m2 + m (2)

z 



< [(1), hee] >onebody d  (  )

(7.2)

where (1) is the rst order generator of transformation, dened by ow equations as (1) =
[h0, hee], hee is the electron-photon vertex operator, and  is proportional to the value of
the integral in eq. (7.2) at the point  and denes mass correction, namely self energy term.

59

physically, in the electron sector the energy scales  down to  from photon emission have been
integrated out and placed in eective interactions (the corresponding in the photon sector);
(3)
renormalize the hamiltonian, i.e. adjust the hamiltonian that its form does not change
under the unitary transformation eq. (7.1) using coupling coherence. as a result we get the
renormalized (in the given order) hamiltonian h.
in this case, since the electron-photon
coupling does not run until third order, the constraint eq. (7.1) is simple to solve: to second
order the self-energy must exactly reproduce itself with   
 + o(e4)] = [m2 + m (2)

 + o(e4)]

(7.3)

(7.4)

[m2  (  ) + m (2)
= [m2   + o(e4)]

this xes the counterterm

m (2)

 =  + o(e4)

i.e. in the second order electron (photon) mass squared runs coherently with the cuto according
to eq. (7.1) as

 = m2  
m2

(7.5)

(4) using the renormalized hamiltonian h calculate physical observables, that due to the
constraint of coupling coherence are cuto and renormalization scale independent (are nite as
   and   0, where  is uv regulator in transverse direction and  is ir regulator in
longitudinal direction (generally, it can be a set of regulators), and are independent of  or any
other scale introduced by renormalization), and manifest the symmetries of the theory broken
by cutos. we calculate the physical mass of electron (photon), that includes the running
mass m from h and in the second order the perturbation theory corrections. in the electron
sector these corrections arise from the low-energy photon emission, since h still has the photon

emission interaction below  of the form fr d2xdxhee. (one has in the photon sector the

corresponding interaction term, where the energy of ee pair is restricted by .) it turns out,
that the electron (photon) perturbative mass-squared shift is exactly equal to the self-energy
term obtained in (3)

m2 =  + o(e4)

therefore the physical mass-squared is given

m2

phys = m2

 + m2 = m2   +  = m2

(7.6)

(7.7)

where m2 is the renormalized electron mass-squared in the free hamiltonian h0. this result
is to be expected, that shows that the renormalization procedure using ow equations and
coupling coherence is successful (at least in the second order).

all details of calculation can be found in two sections that follow. the renormalization
scheme presented seems to work trivially simple in the second order. but there are diculties,
that one encounters in practical calculations. the integral in eq. (7.2) is infrared singular
(in both electron and photon sectors), resulting in infrared divergent self-energy and hence
infrared divergent running mass m, with new types of divergences (the electron mass has
both linear and logarithmic infrared divergences). this is in accordance with the discussion
presented above. the longitudinal cuto violates boost invariance and the mass operator, that
is a function of a longitudinal momentum scale introduced by the cuto, is required to restore
this symmetry in physical results. indeed, as shown by perry [37], the divergent self-energy is

60

exactly canceled by perturbative mixing with small-x photons (see eq. (7.6),eq. (7.7)), resulting
in nite mass.

we try to preserve boost invariance, that is manifest symmetry on the light-front, in the
second order qed calculations on the level of renormalized hamiltonian. we take into account
the diagrams arising from the normal ordering of instantaneous interactions. the bare light-
front qed hamiltonian contains both the instantaneous interactions and the electron-photon
vertex, therefore instantaneous terms must accompany the latter also by scaling from the ener-
gies  down to  eq. (7.1). we get the running electron and photon masses free from infrared
divergences, moreover both electron and photon mass conterterms contain the known from the
covariant perturbation theory types of divergences. unfortunately, the electron wave function
renormalization constant z2 contains mixing uv and ir logarithmic divergences and also pure
ir logarithmic divergence; the renormalization constant z2 in photon sector is ir nite. it is
argued in [50], that the mixing ir divergences are cancelled in gauge invariant quantities. it
is shown in [24], that the mixing divergences are also cancelled completely in the old-fashioned
hamiltonian theory for the coupling constant renormalization. in x+-ordered hamiltonian the-
ory, the mixing divergences cannot and should not be removed as indicated by the negativity
of the second order correction of the wave function renormalization constant, that must result
in a physical theory [24].

zhang and harindranath [24] performed the similar calculations of self-energy mass oper-
ators in light-front qcd, using perturbation theory frame. they have tested dierent types
of regulators to regularize the transverse uv divergences; the regulator for ir divergences
was chosen in accordance with the prescription for boundary terms, arising in the light-front
hamiltonian (see chapter 3). in the scheme discussed above the transverse regulator arise au-
tomatically at the stage (2), where the unitary transformation, dictated by ow equations, is
performed. this is important, since operator classication and renormalization itself are driven
by the scaling in transverse direction. the problem, that still remains, is the violation of rota-
tional and gauge symmetries by this regulator, in other words, by the ow equations. we leave
this problem for future investigation.

further the detailed calculations of electron and photon self energies and physical masses,

using the program outlined above, are presented.

7.2 flow equations for renormalization issues

as was discussed above and in chapters 3 and 4, the commutator [(1), hee] contributes to the
self-energy term, giving rise to the renormalization of fermion and photon masses to the second
order. the ow equation for the electron (photon) light-cone energy p is

dp
dl

=< [(1), hee] >self energy ,

(7.8)

where the matrix element is calculated between the single electron (photon) states < p, s|...|p, s >.
we drop the nite part and dene p = p(l) < |h0| >. integration over the nite range
gives

p  p =z l

l

< [(1), hee] >self energy dl = 

((p)  (p))

p+

,

(7.9)

that denes the cuto dependent self energy (p). the mass correction and wave function
renormalization constant are given correspondingly, cf. [24]

m2

 = p+p(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)p2=m2 = (m2)

(7.10)

p

p (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)p2=m2

the on-mass-shell condition is dened through the mass m in the free hamiltonian h0.

we show further, that to the second order o(e2) the electron and photon masses and
corresponding wave function renormalization constants in the renormalized hamiltonian vary
in accordance with the result of 1-loop renormalization group equations. this can serve as
evidence for the equivalence of the ow equations and wilsons renormalization. therefore
we have rewritten the mass correction m2
 through the self energy term, arising in 1-loop
calculations of ordinary perturbative theory. the negative overall sign stems from our denition
of the ow parameter, namely for l > 0 we are lowering the cuto dl =  2

3 d.

we start with the bare cuto mass m2

 = m2 + m (2)

 , where m (2)

 is the second order mass

counterterm. according to eq. (7.9),eq. (7.10) the electron (photon) mass runs

m2

 = m2

  [(m2)  (m2)]

(7.11)

dening, due to renormalizability, the counterterm m (2)
dence of the renormalized mass on the cuto 

 = m2

 = (m2) and the depen-

m2

 = m2 + m2

 = m2   .

(7.12)

we calculate explicitly the self-energy term. the electron energy correction contains several
terms

p =< p, s|h  h0|p, s >=  3xn=1

pn!  (3)(p  p)ss .

(7.13)

the rst term is induced by the ow equation in single electron sector, namely comes from the
commutator [(1), hee]

p1 = z 

l

< [(1), hee] >self energy dl = 

1(p)

it reads, cf. eq. (c.10) in appendix c,

this term explicitly depends on the cuto  (l = 1/2) through the similarity function, that
plays the role of a regulator in the loop integration

r = f 2

p,k, = exp(2(cid:18)p,k

 (cid:19)2) .

(7.16)

eq. (7.15) corresponds to the rst diagram in g.(9).

two instantaneous diagrams, the second and third in g.(9), contribute the cuto indepen-
dent (constant) terms. they arise from normal-ordered instantaneous interactions in the single
electron sector and can be written as

pn = pn(l = 0) = cn < o o+ > v inst

performed before the regulator is taken into account [24]. (in the second integral the electron
momentum is replaced by the gluon one due to momentum conservation). the brackets [ ]
denote the principle value prescription, dened further in eq. (7.27).

the loop integral over k eqs. (7.20) and (7.21) contains two types of divergences: uv in
the transversal coordinate  and ir in the longitudinal component k+. the physical value
of mass must be ir-nite. we show, that the three relevant diagrams together in fact give an
ir-nite value for the renormalized mass; this enables to determine counterterms independent

it is remarkable that we reproduce with the cuto condition of eq. (7.24) the standard result
of covariant perturbative theory calculations including its global factor 3/8. as was mentioned
above, the dierence in sign, as compared with the 1-loop renormalization group result, comes
from scaling down from high to low energies in the method of ow equations.

the similar regularization for the intermediate state momenta in the self-energy integrals,
called global cuto scheme, was introduced by w. m. zhang and a. harindranath [24]. in our
approach the uv-regularization, that denes the concrete form of the regulator r, arises nat-
urally from the method of ow equations, namely from the unitary transformation performed,
where the generator of the transformation is chosen as the commutator  = [hd, hr]. note
also, that the regulator r, eq. (7.23), in general is independent of the electron momentum p+
(rescaled cuto 1  ), and therefore is boost invariant.

two instantaneous diagrams, arising from the normal-ordering hamiltonian, must be added
to the rst term with the same regulator r. then the full perturbative energy correction
 p =  p1 +  p2 +  p3 is

 p = p

where p is dened in eq. (7.13). this means for the perturbative mass correction

mp t 2

 = 

(7.52)

(7.53)

and the self-energy term  is given in eq. (7.30).

we combine the mass operator, renormalized to the second order, eq. (7.12), and the per-

turbation theory correction, eq. (7.53), to obtain the total physical mass to the order o(e2)

m2

e = m2

 + m2 = (m2 + )   = m2 + o(e4) .

(7.54)

this means, that to the second order o(e2) the physical electron mass is, up to a nite part,
equal to the electron mass, that stands in the free (canonical) hamiltonian h0.

along the same line one can proceed for the photon mass. one nds in the second order
in coupling, that the photon mass counterterm, obtained from the ow equations eq. (7.44)-
eq. (7.46), is equal up to the overall sign to the perturbative photon mass correction. this
means, that in the order o(e2) the physical photon mass is equal to the photon mass term in
the free hamiltonian, i.e.

m2

ph = 0 + o(e4)

(7.55)

68

here the photon mass in the canonical qed hamiltonian is equal to zero to preserve gauge
invariance.

at the end we note, that the similarity function fpipf , restricting the electron-photon vertex,
plays the role of uv (and partially ir) regulator in the self energy integrals. this means, that
the regularization prescription of divergent integrals follows from the method of ow equations
itself. moreover, the energy correction (i.e. mass correction and wave function renormalization
constant), obtained from the ow equations, coincide up to the overall sign with the 1-loop
renormalization group result. this is the remarkable result, indicating to the equivalence of
ow equations and wilsons renormalization.

chapter 8

conclusions and outlook

in this work we applied the method of ow equations to qed on the light-front. we have
outlined a strategy to derive an eective low-energy hamiltonian on the light-front by means
of ow equations, considered in the light-front dynamics. application of the ow equations
with the condition, that particle number conserving terms are considered diagonal and those
changing the particle number o-diagonal led as in other cases to a useful eective hamiltonian.
the main advantage of this procedure as compared with the similarity renormalization
of glazek and wilson [3] is, that nally states of dierent particle number are completely
decoupled, since the particle number violating contributions are eliminated down to  = 0. thus
one is able to truncate the fock space and the positronium problem reduces to a two particle
problem, which was analyzed analytically (since in leading order one obtains the nonrelativistic
coulomb problem) in the chapter 4, and numerically in the chapter 5 for positronium bound
states.

the eective hamiltonian, obtained by the similarity transformation, is band-diagonal in
the energy space. the width of the band  introduces the articial parameter in the procedure,
which is dened from the physical reasoning ( is low enough to neglect the contribution of high
fock states, but is restricted from below to stay in perturbation theory region). flow equations
as used here with the particle number conserving part of hamiltonian to be diagonal, have no
additional parameter and converge well as   0 [2] to the eective hamiltonian, which is
block-diagonal in particle number and are used therefore directly for the numerical calculations
of the spectrum.

the procedure of elimination of nondiagonal blocks, that change the number of quasiparti-
cles, is performed not just in one step as in the method of tamm-danco truncation but rather
continuously for the states with dierent energies in sequence. this is the main advantage of
the proposed method as compared with tamm-danco truncation, the possibility to perform
simultaneously the ultraviolet renormalization of the initial hamiltonian.
in general, in the
denite order of perturbation theory all counterterms, associated with canonical operators of
the theory and also with possible new operators induced by unitary transformation, can be ob-
tained in the procedure [53]. since dierent sectors of the eective hamiltonian are decoupled,
one does not encounter the usual diculties of tamm-danco truncation and the methods
related to it. namely, the counterterms to be introduced are sector- and state- independent
[46].

if one goes beyond the tree approximation then one obtains terms with ultraviolet di-
in the second order in coupling the electron and
vergences which have to be renormalized.
photon divergent mass corrections are generated by ow equations. there are the same type
of uv-divergences as obtained in the covariant perturbation theory, the ir-divergences in the

70

longitudinal direction and mixed uv- and ir-divergences in the mass terms. the two lat-
ter types of divergences are specic for the light-front qed calculations. they signal, that the
boost invariance is broken, since an explicit dependence on the longitudinal ir-cuto occur. to
preserve boost invariance in the renormalized hamiltonian we take into account the diagrams
arising from the normal ordering of instantaneous interactions. using then ow equations and
coupling coherence we obtain the counterterms for electron and photon masses, that are free
from ir-divergences.

simultaneously also terms describing interactions between more than two particles are gen-
erated. in this approach we were not faced with infrared problems, except for the longitudinal
ir-divergences, which arise due to the light-front gauge formulation and must be treated prop-
erly. these divergences, arising on the level of eective qed hamiltonian, show that some
symmetries of the initial theory, that are not manifest on the light-front, are broken. the rst
problem in the light-front eld theory is that whenever the generator of a symmetry is dynam-
ical (contains interactions) it is practically impossible to monitor and maintain that symmetry
at each step of a calculations- unless of course one can solve the theory exactly. this concerns
parity and rotational invariance, that are not manifest on the light-front. the second problem
is that whenever we use the hamiltonian technique, the regularization by introducing bare cut-
os breaks the gauge invariance (and also lorenz covariance), and forces the bare hamiltonian
to contain a larger than normal suite of counterterms to enable a nite limit as the cutos are
removed. one way is, that the counterterms are then adjusted to reproduce physical observ-
ables and to restore the symmetries broken by the cutos. the other way is to nd the gauge
invariant procedure for regularization of hamiltonians. the attempt in the latter direction was
made by brodsky, hiller, mccartor [47]. solving the yukawa theory they have tried to preserve
more symmetries by using pauli-villars procedure for regularization.

in our calculations, the eective electron-positron interaction, obtained in the second order
in coupling, contains the ir-divergent term, describing instant emission and absorption of lon-
gitudinal photon. the physical reason for its appearance is the violation of lorenz and gauge
symmetries by the derivation of the eective, renormalized hamiltonian. we use the symmetric
cuto condition for ir-divergences in the eective interaction to cancel their contribution to
the mass of positronium. we nd, that in this case the rotational symmetry is restored on the
level of positronium mass spectrum.

in order to solve the ow equations analytically we were forced to apply in this work the
perturbation theory expansion. one is able to improve this approach systematically by going
to higher orders in the coupling. it is a remarkable result, that the eective electron-positron
hamiltonian, obtained in the second order in coupling, gives the correct bohr spectrum and
hyperne splitting for positronium.

we consider ow equations as a method which can also be used beyond perturbation theory
in a self-consistent way. examples in solid-state physics are the ow of the tunneling-frequency
in the spin-boson model [6] and of the phonon energies in the electron-phonon coupling [10].
due to the ow the couplings decay even at resonance.

matrix elements of the eective
interaction.exchange channel

in this appendix we follow the scheme of the work [30] to calculate the matrix elements of
the eective interaction in the exchange channel. here, we list the general, angle-dependent
matrix elements dening the eective interaction in the exchange channel eq. (6.55) (part
i), and the corresponding matrix elements of the eective interaction for arbitrary jz, after
integrating out the angles eq. (6.6) (part ii). the whole is given for the similarity function
f() = u() = (2  ||) eq. (2.34) with the sharp cuto. the eective interaction
generated by the unitary transformation in the exchange channel reads eq. (6.58),eq. (6.61)

the energy denominator (  and a corresponding) in the case of perturbative theory is given
for completeness.

it is useful to display the matrix elements of the eective interaction in the form of ta-
bles. the matrix elements depend on the one hand on the momenta of the electron and
positron, respectively, and on the other hand on their helicities before and after the inter-
action. the dependence on the helicities occur during the calculation of these functions
e(x, ~k; 1, 2|x, ~k
; 1, 2) in part ii as dierent

kronecker deltas [45]. these functions are displayed in the form of helicity tables. we use the
following notation for the elements of the tables

; 1, 2) in part i and g(x, k; 1, 2|x, k


fi(1, 2)  ei(x, ~k; x, ~k


); gi(x, k; x, k


)

also we have used in both cases for the permutation of particle and anti-particle

f 3 (x, ~k; x, ~k


) = f3(1  x,~k; 1  x,~k


)

(b.5)

(b.6)

one has the corresponding for the elements of arbitrary jz; in the case when the function addi-
tionally depends on the component of the total angular momentum jz = n we have introduced

fi(n) = fi(n)

(b.7)

b.1 the general helicity table.

to calculate the matrix elements of the eective interaction in the exchange channel we use
the matrix elements of the dirac spinors listed in table b.1 [45]. also the following holds
v(p)v(q) = u(q)u(p).

we introduce for the matrix elements entering in the eective interaction eq. (b.1)
