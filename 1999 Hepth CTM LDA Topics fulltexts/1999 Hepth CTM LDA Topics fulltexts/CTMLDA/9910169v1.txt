we re-examine the graceful exit problem in the pre-big bang scenario of string cosmology, by
considering the most general time-dependent classical correction to the lagrangian with up to four
derivatives. by including possible forms for quantum loop corrections we examine the allowed region
of parameter space for the coupling constants which enable our solutions to link smoothly the two
asymptotic low-energy branches of the pre-big bang scenario, and observe that these solutions can
satisfy recently proposed entropic bounds on viable singularity free cosmologies.

i. introduction

it is generally accepted that standard cosmology pro-
vides a consistent picture of the evolution of the uni-
verse from the period of primordial nucleosynthesis to
the present. however, as we extrapolate further into the
past, our knowledge becomes less certain as we appear
to be inevitably lead to an initial curvature singularity
[1]. the emergence of string theory as the favoured can-
didate to unify the forces of nature has led a number of
authors to investigate the cosmology associated with it
(for a recent review see [2]). one such approach has been
pioneered by veneziano and his collaborators, and em-
ploys the rich duality properties present in string theory
[36], and leads to a class of solutions which eectively
talk about a period before the big bang, the pre-big bang
scenario [6,7]. the universe expands from a weak cou-
pling, low curvature regime in the innite past, enters a
period of ination driven by the kinetic energy associ-
ated with the massless elds present, before approaching
the strong coupling regime as the string scale is reached.
there is then a branch change to a new class of solutions,
corresponding to a post big bang decelerating friedman-
robertson-walker era. in such a scenario, the universe
appears to emerge because of the gravitational instability
of the generic string vacua [8,9]. in many ways this is a
very appealing picture, the weak coupling, low curvature
regime is a natural starting point to use the low energy
string eective action. however, there are a number of
problems facing the scenario. one is that of initial condi-
tions, why should such a large universe be a natural ini-
tial state to emerge from and does it possess enough ina-
tion before entering the strong coupling regime [10,11,8]?
the second is how can the dilaton eld be stabilised in
the post big bang phase? it must be decoupled from the
expansion since variations in this scalar eld correspond
to changes in masses and coupling constants, which are
strongly constrained by observation [12,13]. a number of
attempts have been made to do this; by including dilaton
self-interaction potentials and trapping the dilaton in a
potential minimum [14] and by taking into account the

back-reaction on the dilaton eld from quantum parti-
cle production [15]. the third is the graceful exit prob-
lem. how can the curvature singularity associated with
the strong coupling regime be avoided, so as to allow a
smooth branch change between the pre-big bang ina-
tionary solution and a decelerating post big bang frw
solution? the simplest version of the evolution of the
universe in the pre-big bang scenario inevitably leads to
a period characterised by an unbounded curvature. no-
go theorems prevent the inclusion of a single potential to
catalyse a branch change in vacuum-dilaton cosmology
[16,17]. the current philosophy is to include higher-order
corrections to the string eective action. these include
both classical nite size eects of the strings, and quan-
tum string loop corrections and have already met with
some success [18,15,19].

the motivation behind this paper is to investigate the
graceful exit issue by studying in detail a physically mo-
tivated action at both the classical and quantum level
which can incorporate a number of appealing features,
such as being able to maintain scale factor duality (sfd),
even when these higher order corrections are included.

the classical corrections to the low energy eective
string action usually have associated with them xed
points where the hubble parameter in the string frame
is constant and the dilaton is growing [18]. we will see
that although physically very appealing, the sfd invari-
ant action does not drive the evolution of the universe
into a good xed point (in agreement with brustein and
madden [20]), and moreover the inclusion of quantum
corrections do not lead to a smooth exit into the deceler-
ating frw branch, rather they lead to a regime of insta-
bility. fortunately, relaxing the sfd condition leads to
many interesting features: the loop corrections introduce
an upper (lower) bound for the curvature in the string
(einstein) frame, suggesting that a graceful exit is vi-
able in this context, and indeed we present a number of
successful exits.

the paper is organised as follows. in section 2, we dis-
cuss the eective low energy action of the heterotic string
including o() corrections arising from the nite size ef-

1

the stage when the universe completes a smooth transi-
tion to the post-big bang branch, characterised by a xed
value of the dilaton and a decelerating frw expansion.
one of the unresolved issues of the transition concerns
whether or not the actual exit takes place at large cou-
pling, e  1. if it occurred whilst the coupling was still
small, then we would be happy to use the perturbative
corrections we are adopting. however, if the universe
is driven into the strong coupling regime before the exit
proceeds then we might expect to have to adopt a dier-
ent approach which involves the use of non-perturbative
string phenomena. such a possibility has recently been
proposed in the context of m-theory [19,22].

the type of corrections we will be considering involve
truncations of the classical action at order . although
a eld redenition mixing the dierent orders in  does
not change the physics if one considers all orders in ,
it inevitably leads to ambiguities when some orders are
truncated. this means that the cosmological evolution
arising from such actions truncated at order  should
really only be considered as an indication of the possi-
ble cosmological behaviour. the most general form for
a correction to the string action up to fourth-order in
derivatives has been presented in refs [23]- [25]:

fects. in section 3 we review previous studies of graceful
exit using a truncated form of these corrections and then
make a comparison with the full classical correction. we
also extend these descriptions by including possible one-
and two-loop quantum corrections. these turn out to
be crucial in order to provide a successful graceful exit
to the pre-big bang scenario [15,20]. particle creation is
then used to stabilise the dilaton in the post-big bang
era. finally in section 4 we summarise our main results.

ii. string effective action

the pre-big bang scenario is an inationary model
starting with a generic state of extremely weak cou-
pling and curvature, pictured as a gravitational collapse
in the einstein frame. this rather trivial asymptotic
past state is followed by a dilaton-driven kinetic ination
phase which has to be long enough to solve the dierent
cosmological problems inherent to standard cosmologies
[8]. later on, this superinationary period should be
smoothly connected to the frw regime, characterised
by a decelerating expansion and a frozen or slowly evolv-
ing dilaton, whose present expectation value gives rise to
the universal gravitational constant.

we shall take as our starting point the minimal

4dimensional string eective action:

(0) =

=

1

 z d4xgl(0)
 z d4xge2nr + 4()2o,

1

 + . . . and r = r

where we adopt the convention (, +, +, +), r
 =

 and set our units such
that h = c = 16g = 1. by low-energy tree-level eec-
tive action, we mean that the string is propagating in a
background of small curvature and the elds are weakly
coupled. however, the evolution from the pre-big bang
era to the present is understood to be characterised by a
regime of growing couplings and curvature. this means
that the universe will have to evolve through a phase
when the eld equations of this eective action are no
longer valid. hence, the low-energy dynamical descrip-
tion has to be supplemented by corrections in order to
reliably describe the transition regime.

the nite size of the string will have an impact on
the evolution of the scale factor when the curvature of
the universe reaches a critical level, corresponding to

the string length scale s   (xed in the string

frame), and such corrections are expected to stabilise the
growth of the curvature into a de-sitter like regime of
constant curvature and linearly growing dilaton [18,21].
eventually the dilaton will play a major role, and since
the loop expansion is governed by powers of the string
coupling parameter gs = e, these quantum corrections
will modify dramatically the evolution when we reach the
strong coupling region [21,15]. this should correspond to

(c) =

1

 z d4xgl(c)
= k0z d4xge2nar2

(1)

+c(cid:8)r 

1
2

gb + b()2
gr(cid:9) + d()4o,

(2)

where the parameter 0 allows us to move between dif-
ferent string theories and we will set k0 =  1
4 to agree
with previous studies of the heterotic string [18]. r2
gb =
rr  4rr + r2 is the gauss-bonnet com-
bination which guarantees the absence of higher deriva-
tives. in xing the dierent parameters in this action we
require that it reproduces the usual string scattering am-
plitudes [2325]. this constrains the coecient of r2

with the result that the pre-factor for the gauss-bonnet
term has to be a = 1. but the lagrangian can still be
shifted by eld redenitions which preserve the on-shell
amplitudes, leaving only that the three remaining coe-
cients of the classical correction satisfy the constraint

2(b + c) + d = 16a.

(3)

there is as yet no denitive calculation of the full loop
expansion of string theory. this is of course a big problem
if we want to try and include quantum eects in analysing
the graceful exit issue. the best we can do, is to propose
plausible terms that we hope are representative of the
actual terms that will eventually make up the loop cor-
rections. we believe that the string coupling gs actually
controls the importance of string-loop corrections, so as
a rst approximation to the loop corrections we multiply
each term of the classical correction by a suitable power

2

of the string coupling [15]. when loop corrections are
included, we then have an eective lagrangian given by

l = l(0) + l(c) + ae2l(c) + be4l(c),

(4)
where l(0) is given in eq. (1) and l(c) given in eq. (2),
with the constant parameters a and b actually control-
ling the onset of the loop corrections.

iii. numerical solutions

in this section, we consider the impact of both the
classical and quantum corrections of eq. (4). naively, we
would expect that the latter should only become signif-
icant as we enter the strong coupling regime. depend-
ing on the value of the dilaton eld, the loop corrections
are indeed negligible in the weak coupling regime as the
dilaton   , so we expect that the solutions to the
extended equations of motion should initially be simi-
lar to the lowest-order description, with the classical and
quantum corrections introducing an upper bound for the
solutions, thereby regulating their singular behaviour.

following brustein and madden [15], we dene the
parameters hs as the hubble expansion in the string
frame, he as the hubble expansion in the einstein frame
and  the derivative of the dilaton eld with respect to
cosmic time, ts. hence, the solutions to the equations
of motion resulting from eq. (1) can be expressed as

2  = (3  3)hs, where the upper (lower) sign refers

    3hs/2 [21]. also,

to the pre- (post-) big bang solution. although start-
ing in the perturbative regime, the (+) branch (hs > 0,
 > 0 and he < 0) evolves toward a curvature singular-
ity, and the low-energy eective description breaks down.
more precisely, we expect modications to become sig-
nicant when the curvature is of order the planck length
s and the low-energy eective action has to be replaced
by one which includes higher-order eects in . it has
been known for some time that a necessary condition to
obtain a successful exit is the violation of the null en-
ergy condition (nec), which corresponds to a change of
sign of the shifted dilaton,
to allow a smooth connection to the usual decelerated
friedmann universe where the dilaton will become xed,
the hubble rate in the einstein frame has to become
positive after the branch change. using the conformal
transformation relating the string frame to the einstein
frame, ge
, the hubble expansion in the e-
frame can be expressed as a function of s-frame quanti-
ties, he = e{hs }. this relation denes the einstein
bounce eb = hs  , signalling a change of sign of the
hubble rate in the einstein frame [21]. thus we see that
a number of dierent conditions must be satised for a
successful exit to be obtained. in the gures below, all
these constraints are presented as lines on the plots, i.e.
the (+) and () branches of the low energy string action,
the nec and the einstein bounce. we now go on to look
at some particular examples.

the dilaton for the case a = 1, b = c = 0 and d = 16. the
y-axis corresponds to h, and the x-axis to 2 /3. the initial
conditions for the simulations have been set with respect to
the lowest-order analytical solutions at ts = 1000. the
straight black lines describe the bounds quoted in section ii.
the dotted magenta line shows the impact of the classical
correction due to the nite size of the string. a  denotes
the xed point. the contribution of the one-loop expansion is
traced with a dashed cyan line (a = 4). the dash-dotted blue
line represents the incorporation of the two-loop correction
without the gauss-bonnet combination (b = 0.1). finally,
the green plain line introduces radiation with  = 0.08 and
stabilises the dilaton.

a. minimal case

the natural setting b = c = 0 leads to the well-known
form which has given rise to most of the studies on correc-
tions to the low-energy picture. in references [18,21], the
authors demonstrated that this minimal classical correc-
tion regularises the singular behaviour of the low-energy
pre-big bang scenario. it drives the evolution to a xed
point of bounded curvature with a linearly growing dila-
ton (the star in fig. 1  which agrees with the results
of [18,21]), suggesting that quantum loop corrections -
known to allow a violation of the null energy condition
(p +  < 0)- would permit a branch change to the frw
decelerated expansion in the post-big bang era. indeed,
the addition of loop corrections leads to a () frw-
branch as pictured in fig. 1. however, we still have to
freeze the growth of the dilaton. following [15], we intro-
duce by hand a particle creation term of the form  ,
where  is the decay width of the  particle, in the equa-
tion of motion of the dilaton eld and then coupling it
to a uid with the equation of state of radiation in such
a way as to preserve overall conservation. this allows
us to stabilise the dilaton in the post-big bang era with
a decreasing hubble rate, similar to the usual radiation
dominated frw cosmology.

b. scale factor duality case

in [2325], the authors considered the particular com-
bination b = c = 16 which has the remarkable prop-
erty of introducing scale factor duality at the order 
in the correction to the low-energy action at the price of
discarding non-sfd invariant terms of higher order and
making a modication to the denition of sfd at order
alpha. unfortunately, as can be seen in fig. 2, this
choice of parameters does not lead to a successful exit.
the classical correction forces the curve to head away
from the branch changing and exit region. in fact even
including loop corrections it is impossible to violate the
nec, given in fig. 2 by the line  = 0. such an obser-
vation was previously also made in [20]. what appears
to be happening is that including the one-loop correction
drives the system into a regime where the acceleration
of the scale factor (a) diverges. this is a singular point
in the equation of motion and is indicated by the star
in fig. 2. as discussed in [20], it may be that working
with higher orders in the corrections, further alterations
of the form of sfd may be required.

of the shifted dilaton (2 ) for the sfd case, with a = 1,
b = c = 16 and d = 16. straight lines are identical to
those in fig. 1. the classical correction makes the curve
turn the wrong way (dotted magenta). the inclusion of the
one-loop correction (dashed) leads to a regime of instabil-
ity: the evolution meets the curve corresponding to a  
(plain). two cases are explicitly shown: a = 0.5 in blue and
a = 16 in cyan, whereas the meeting points for other choices
of the pre-factor a are pictured with stars (*).

c. the general case

relaxing the sfd constraint allows us to investi-
gate the full classical and quantum correction up to
four derivatives and leads to many interesting situations.

4

when a = 1 and d = 16, this implies that the coef-
cient of the curvature-dilaton contribution has the op-
posite sign to that of the ()2 term. fig. 3 shows
the evolution of the solution for b = c = 4. the
xed point obtained by adding classical corrections to
the lowest-order action is well located as the evolution
has already reached the nec region of the (h, ) phase
space, indicating that generic loop corrections will drive
the evolution across the einstein bounce. indeed, setting
a = +4 we see that the evolution crosses the einstein
bounce as well as the () branch. this suggests that the
violation of the nec is too large and will not give an
upper bound to the curvature in the einstein frame. an
extra two-loop term is thus required to instigate the tran-
sition to a decelerated expansion in the einstein frame.
as shown in fig. 3 when such a term is included with
b = 0.3, we obtain a successful implementation of the
graceful exit. once again, we invoke particle production
in order to eventually stabilise the dilaton in the usual
frw cosmology.

the shifted dilaton (2 ) for the case a = 1, b = c = 4
and d = 16, with a = +4 (dashed cyan) and b = 0.3
(dash-dotted blue). the plain green line includes the eect of
the particle creation, with  = 0.2. the frw and fp lines
represent solutions for the xed points given in eq. (5).

an important issue concerns the sensitivity of our re-
sults to the values of the parameters a, b, c, d, a and b.
do we nd successful transitions for only a small range
of these values, in which case we should be concerned
that our solutions are not representative of the typical
case? fortunately, we have established that there does
exist a range of values of the parameters which allow for
successful exits between the two branches. in the case
just described, the condition b = c = 4 is not par-
ticularly important, similar behaviour is obtained with
other combinations satisfying b = c. indeed the curve
of xed points in the plane (h, ) for the case b = c is
given by the implicit equation:

in fact other combinations of these two parameters only
modify the shape of the transition as long as we satisfy
the inequality [20]

1.912 d + 2.553 b  16.083.

(6)

in other words, they tend to leave intact the nal be-
haviour of the solutions when loop corrections are added.
moreover, it is not vital that we have b = c either and
we have obtained a class of solutions which do not im-
pose that condition. as mentioned earlier, the role of a
and b is to determine the onset when loop corrections
become important. generally we nd that a successful
exit requires a > 0, but this is not always the case. de-
pending on the specic values of the other coecients,
we nd that b can be positive or negative.

d. entropic bounds

there has recently been considerable interest in the
possibility that entropy considerations can provide new
constraints on the allowed evolution of the universe
[2629]. veneziano has suggested that in the context
of string cosmology, non-singular cosmologies should re-
spect at all times a hubble entropy bound [27]. brustein
has proposed that such solutions should satisfy a slightly
dierent bound arising from a generalised second law of
thermodynamics (gsl) [28]. do our non-singular solu-
tions satisfy these bounds?

we will concentrate on the example of the hubble
entropy bound [27]. following beckensteins work [30],
veneziano suggested that for a homogeneous cosmology,
the radius of the largest black hole that can form is de-
termined by the largest causal scale available, namely the
hubble radius h 1. the maximum entropy enclosed in
such a universe corresponds to having one black hole in
a hubble volume. dening nh = a3h 3 to be the number
of cosmological horizons within a given comoving volume
and sh = |h|2e2 the maximal entropy within the
horizon corresponding to a black hole of radius h 1, the
hubble entropy is given by shb = a3he2 [27]. from
this it follows that:

t shb = nh tsh + sh tnh .

(7)

enforcing that the rate of change of this geometric en-
tropy t shb  0 leads to the reduced inequality

h
h  2   0

(8)

with the lowest-order solutions of the pbb scenario sat-
urating this geometric bound [27,31,32]. furthermore,

it indicates that a xed point necessarily occurs for
non-positive  (a conclusion that also follows from the
presence of a conserved quantity in the solutions [18]).
brustein et al. provided evidence in [29] that the bound
was satised for the non-singular solutions arising out of
the purely classical correction eq. (2) satisfying a = 1
and the constraint eq. (3). we have conrmed this result,
although we have also found that all the non-singular
solutions we have obtained, when including loop correc-
tions, lead to violations of this bound over short time
intervals. however, as pointed out by veneziano, this is
really a global bound, in the asymptotic future, as we
enter the frw phase, we always nd that shb has in-
creased. an example of this can be seen in fig. 4.

the dotted line represents the classical correction, then the
loop corrections with a = +4 (dashed line) and b = 0.3
(dash-dotted line). the plain green line also includes the ef-
fect of particle creation, with  = 0.2.

the comparison becomes a bit more dicult when con-
sidering the bound proposed by brustein arising from a
generalised second law of thermodynamics (gsl) [28].
we do nd a class of solutions which satisfy such a bound
for positive values of the chemical potential  that he in-
troduced, but we also nd solutions which violate the
bound. it is dicult to draw any real conclusion from
this, not least because we do not know the precise form
of the quantum corrections or particle production the
true graceful exit solution will contain. it is certainly in-
teresting that there are regions of parameter space where
the bound is satised. the nature of these bounds is also
under active consideration at the moment [33].

iv. conclusions

in this paper, we have obtained a class of non-singular
cosmologies, based on a physically well motivated eec-
tive action given in eqs. (1), (2) and (4). the inclu-

5

sion of such classical and quantum corrections can lead
to an evolution which smoothly joins the inationary
pre-big bang solution with a decelerating frw universe.
the classical correction is based on an enhanced form of
the action which includes up to four derivatives in the
elds. the importance of quantum loops in achieving
a smooth transition has become manifest, in agreement
with [15,20]. furthermore, we observe that these non-
singular solutions can satisfy the recently proposed en-
tropics bounds when loop-corrections are included.

although encouraging, the solutions we have presented
still have side eects; in particular we had to stabilise the
dilaton by hand. also, it proved quite dicult to obtain
the transition in the weak coupling regime, generally we
found that the transition occured in the cross-over regime
between weak and strong coupling, i.e.   0.7 in the
it is not clear whether this is a
case b = c = 4.
real problem for such models. perhaps a better choice
of parameters would lead to a solution occuring in the
weak coupling regime. an intriguing issue is the unusual
behaviour surrounding the sfd case. why do these sin-
gular regions arise and what do they correspond to phys-
ically?

finally, we would like to comment on a possible natu-
ral extension of this work. recently in refs [34,35] the
authors have developed a technique to determine the
large-scale cmb anisotropy and power spectra generated
by massless axionic seeds in the pre-big bang scenario.
they numerically determined the cmb anisotropy power
spectrum and pointed out the dierences (isocurvature
hump at l  40 and rst acoustic peak at l  300) with
more standard adiabatic models. these are fascinating
results, but are based on numerical solutions for the cur-
vature and dilaton that have not really avoided the cur-
vature singularity. instead they are frozen at some scale,
and then begin evolving again once the post big bang
frw branch is entered. we are in a position to pro-
vide solutions where the background elds evolve right
through the transition in a singularity free manner, and
it would be useful to determine how such an evolution im-
pacts on the modes leaving the horizon during the tran-
sition period. how (if at all) do they inuence the cmb
spectrum at large l? this is currently under investiga-
tion.
