abstract

we study fractional branes in n = 2 orbifold and n = 1 conifold theories. placing
a large number n of regular d3-branes at the singularity produces the dual ads5  x 5
geometry, and we describe the fractional branes as small perturbations to this background.
for the orbifolds, x 5 = s5/ and fractional d3-branes excite complex scalars from the
twisted sector which are localized on the xed circle of x 5. the resulting solutions are
given by holomorphic functions and the eld-theoretic beta-function is simply reproduced.
for n regular and m fractional d3-branes at the conifold singularity we nd a non-
conformal n = 1 supersymmetric su (n + m )  su (n ) gauge theory. the dual type
iib background is ads5  t1,1 with ns-ns and r-r 2-form elds turned on. this dual
description reproduces the logarithmic ow of couplings found in the eld theory.

1. introduction

by now there exists an impressive body of evidence that type iib strings on ads5x 5
are dual to large n strongly coupled 4-d conformal gauge theories, in the sense proposed
in [1,2,3]. here x 5 are positively curved 5-d einstein spaces whose simplest example s5
corresponds to the n = 4 supersymmetric su (n ) gauge theory. one may also quotient
this duality by a discrete subgroup  of the su (4) r-symmetry [4,5]. the resulting back-
grounds with x 5 = s5/ are dual to quiver gauge theories with gauge group s(u (n )n)
and bifundamental matter [6], which describe d3-branes near orbifold singularities. in such
orbifold theories, in addition to regular d-branes which can reside on or o the orbifold
xed plane there are also fractional d-branes pinned to the xed plane [7,8]. our goal
in this paper is to consider the eect of such fractional branes on the dual supergravity
background. there is good motivation for studying this problem because, as we discuss
below, introduction of fractional branes breaks the conformal invariance and introduces
rg ow.

it has also been possible to construct dual gauge theories for x 5 which are not locally
s5. the simplest example is x 5 = t1,1 = (su (2)su (2))/u (1) which turns out to be dual
to an n = 1 superconformal su (n )  su (n ) gauge theory with a quartic superpotential
for bifundamental elds [9,10]. in this theory, which arises on d3-branes at the conifold
singularity, it is also possible to introduce fractional d-branes [11,12], and we study their
eects in this paper.

having constructed the gravity duals of xed-point theories, the next logical step is
to study the dual picture of the rg ow. a natural setup for this problem is provided
by the supersymmetric ows connecting orbifold theories and the (generalized) conifold
theories. it is clear, though, that in order to have a consistent picture one cannot restrict
oneself to the  invariant supergravity elds only, and needs to add the massless elds
coming from the twisted sectors. this program was initiated in [9,13], and in this paper
we focus on the role of the twisted sector elds in creating rg ows. considerable progress
on supersymmetric rg ows in other situations has also been made recently [14] (for a
review see [15]). for important work done in studies of non-supersymmetric rg ows see
[16,17].

the basic picture common to all rg problems is that the radial coordinate r of ads5
denes the rg scale of the eld theory, hence the scale dependence of couplings may be
read o from the radial dependence of corresponding supergravity elds.

since the rg ows of couplings in physically relevant gauge theories are logarithmic,
an important problem is to nd gravity duals of logarithmic ows. attempts in this direc-
tion have been made in the context of type 0b string theory [18,19,20]. this is an nsr

1

string with the non-chiral gso projection (1)f + f = 1 which breaks all spacetime super-
symmetry [21] (it is also a (1)fs orbifold of the type iib theory). type 0b theory has
two basic types of d3-branes, electric and magnetic, and we will see that it is appropriate

to call them the fractional branes. if equal numbers of the electric and magnetic branes are
stacked parallel to each other, then we nd on their world volume a u (n )  u (n ) gauge
theory coupled to six adjoint scalars of the rst u (n ), six adjoint scalars of the second

u (n ), and weyl fermions in bifundamental representations. this theory is a regular
zz2 orbifold of the n = 4 u (2n ) gauge theory and hence is conformal in the planar limit
[22,23]. 1

in general, in orbifold theories there are as many types of fractional branes as there

are nodes of the quiver diagram (i.e. the number of gauge groups in the product), or the

number of the irreducible representations of the orbifold group . if one takes a collection

of the fractional branes of each type and the branes corresponding to the irreducible
representation ri are taken ni = dimri times then one gets a single regular d-brane
which can depart to the bulk. more specically, the charge of the fractional brane of ri
type is

qi =

ni
||

(1.1)

where || is the order of the orbifold group. it is well known that pi niqi = 1.

the fractional branes act as sources for the twisted closed string states of the orbifold

theory. in the type 0b example discussed above the two u (n ) groups correspond to the

electric and the magnetic d3-branes, hence these are the two types of fractional branes for

this particular zz2 orbifold. indeed, such branes have tadpoles for the twisted rr 4-form
and for the tachyon [18,24]. if we stack n parallel electric branes only, then we nd an

irregular orbifold theory where the zz2 action does not act on the gauge indices. this
gives su (n ) gauge theory coupled to six adjoint scalars, which is not a cft [18].

equations satised by the gravity dual of this theory were derived in [18], and solved

after some assumptions in [19,20]. the rg ow of the dilaton, which is related to the

gauge coupling, comes from the equation

2 = 

1
4 t 2e/2 .

(1.2)

1 the zz2 is generated by (1)fs , where fs is the fermion number, together with conjugation

by  = (cid:18) i

0 i(cid:19) where i is the n  n identity matrix. this orbifold is called regular because

0

 is traceless.

2

since the tachyon eld t has a source f 2
5 , it departs from zero and causes the dilaton to
depend on r. assuming that t approaches a constant for large r it was found that the rg
ow is logarithmic in the uv [19,20]. while this scenario has a number of uncertainties
(due to the lack of detailed knowledge of the t -dependence in the eective action) it
suggests a mechanism for rg ow of couplings in the dual gravity picture of fractional
branes.
in particular, the presence of twisted elds sourced by the fractional branes
plays the crucial role.

the stack of electric d3-branes denes gauge theory coupled to six scalars elds, but
it is obviously of more interest to remove the scalars and study the pure glue theory [25].
one way of embedding it into string theory is to consider a zz2 orbifold of type 0b by
reection of six coordinates [26]. the regular orbifold theory has gauge group u (n )4
coupled to a chiral eld content:

 four quadruples of bi-fundamental fermions transforming in (ni, ni+1), i = 0, 1, 2, 3;

4  0,

 four sextets of bi-fundamental scalars in (ni, ni+2).

now there are 4 gauge groups in the product, hence there should be 4 dierent types of
fractional branes. if we stack n fractional d3-branes of the same type then we nd pure
glue u (n ) gauge theory on their world volume [26]. this suggests that fractional branes
may provide a link to string duals of realistic gauge theories.2

with this eventual goal in mind, in this paper we study gravity duals of fractional
branes in supersymmetric conifold and orbifold theories: the susy removes some of the
eective action uncertainties present in the type 0b case. to simplify matters further we
consider theories where functions for t hooft couplings g2
ymn are of order 1/n rather
than of order 1. such gauge theories occur on m fractional d3-branes parallel to n regular
d3-branes, with m held xed in the large n limit. in the simplest examples we consider,
the gauge group is then su (n + m )  su (n ).

the large number n of regular d3-branes produces the dual ads5  x 5 background,
and for our purposes we may ignore the back-reaction of the m fractional d3-branes on it.
however, the fractional branes act as sources for an extra set of elds, namely the 2-form
potentials bnsns and brr. the ux of these 2-forms through a certain 2-cycle of x 5
(more precisely its deviation from the value at the orbifold point) denes the dierence
between g2
ym for the gauge groups factors. in the n = 2 supersymmetric orbifold cases the
2-cycles are collapsed, so that the twisted sector elds corresponding to the 2-form uxes
are conned to ads5s1 where s1 is the xed circle of s5/. by studying the dependence
2 it seems unclear, however, whether the fractional d3-branes in the zz4 theory which are stuck

to the xed fourplane exist, for their ux has nowhere to escape to.

3

of these twisted sector elds on the ads5 radial coordinate r we nd the logarithmic ow
of the gauge couplings consistent with eld theory expectations. in fact, the twisted sector
elds are given by holomorphic functions of the complex variable z = rei where  is the
s1 coordinate (previously known solutions of n = 2 gauge theories are also characterized
by holomorphic functions [27,28,29]).3 remarkably, in the limit we are studying all string-
scale corrections are small, so that the use of eective supergravity equations is justied.

2. fractional branes on the conifold.

let us start by reviewing what is known about regular d3-branes at conical singu-
larities. if a large number n of d3-branes is placed at the apex of a 6-d cone y 6 with
metric

ds2

cone = dr2 + r2ds2

5 ,

(2.1)

then the near-horizon region of the resulting 10-d geometry has the metric

1 + dx2

2 + dx2

dr2
r2 + ds2

5(cid:21) ,

r4 (dt2 + dx2

ds2 = r2(cid:20) r2
this geometry is ads5  x 5 where x 5 is the base of the cone (if y6 is ricci-at then
x 5 is a positively curved einstein space [31,9]. type iib theory on this background is
conjectured to be dual to the conformal limit of the gauge theory on n d3-branes placed
at the apex [9,10].

r4  gsn ()2 .

(2.2)

an example where such a duality has been tested extensively is when y 6 is the conifold,
which is a singular calabi-yau manifold described in terms of complex variables w1, . . . , w4
by the equation [32]

xa=1

a = 0 .

the base of this cone is t1,1 = (su (2)  su (2))/u (1) whose einstein metric may be
written down explicitly [32],

(2.3)

the n = 1 superconformal eld theory on n regular d3-branes placed at the singularity of
the conifold has gauge group su (n ) su (n ) and global symmetry su (2) su (2) u (1)
3 supergravity duals of logarithmic rg ows in n = 2 gauge theories are being independently

studied in [30].

[9]. the chiral superelds a1, a2 transform as (n, n) and are a doublet of the rst su (2);
the chiral superelds b1, b2 transform as (n, n) and are a doublet of the second su (2).
the r-charge of all four chiral superelds is 1/2 and the theory has an exactly marginal
superpotential w = ij kltraibkajbl.

iib supergravity modes on ads5  t1,1 have been matched in some detail with oper-
ators in this gauge theory whose dimensions are of order 1 in the large n limit [33,34]. in
addition, string theory has heavy supersymmetric states obtained by wrapping d3-branes
over 3-cycles of t1,1. they have been shown [11] to correspond to dibaryon operators
whose dimensions grow as 3n/4 (schematically, these operators have the form deta or
detb). further, one may consider a domain wall in ads5 obtained by wrapping a d5-
brane over the 2-cycle of t1,1 (topologically, t1,1 is s2 s3). if this domain wall is located
at r = r then, by studying the behavior of wrapped d3-branes upon crossing it, it was
shown in [11] that for r > r the gauge group changes to su (n + 1)  su (n ). note that
this is precisely the gauge theory expected on n regular and one fractional d3-branes!
thus, a d5-brane wrapped over the 2-cycle is nothing but a fractional d3-brane placed
at a denite r.4 the identication of a fractional d3-brane with a wrapped d5-brane is
consistent with the results of [35,8,36,12].

as shown in [11], this suggests a construction of the type iib dual for the n = 1
su (n + m ) su (n ) gauge theory. in particular, the background has to contain m units
of r-r 3-form ux through the 3-cycle of t1,1:

zc 3

h rr = m .

(2.4)

if m is xed as n   then the back-reaction of h rr on the metric and the f5 back-
ground may be ignored to leading order in n . however, as we will show, the background
must also include the ns-ns 2-form potential

where 2 is the closed 2-form corresponding to the 2-cycle which is dual to c 3,

bnsns = ef (r) 2 ,

zc 2

2 = 1 .

the desired connection with the rg ow is due to the fact that [5,9,11,10]

4 similarly, a regular d3-brane serves as a domain wall between su (n )  su (n ) and su (n +
1)  su (n + 1) gauge theory. this has a simple interpretation in terms of higgsing the theory.

(2.8)

where  are the anomalous dimensions of the elds ai and bj. for m = 0 we nd
a xed point with a = b = 1/4 which corresponds to r-charge 1/2. this is the
superconformal gauge theory dual to ads5  t1,1 with vanishing 2-form potentials. for
m 6= 0 it is impossible to make both beta functions vanish (even if we allow the anomalous
dimensions of a and b to be dierent) and the theory undergoes logarithmic rg ow:

(2.9)

near the xed point we expect a + b = 1/2 plus small corrections, hence the rhs
gives  m log(/).

let us reproduce this result in supergravity. we need the type iib sugra equations
of motion involving the 2-form gauge potentials. we will write these equations in the
ads5  t1,1 background with constant  = c0 + ie (this is the sl2(zz) covariant
combination of the dilaton and the r-r scalar of the type iib theory):5

g is the complex 3-form eld strength,

dg = if5  g .

g = h rr +  h nsns ,

(2.10)

(2.11)

which satises the bianchi identity dg = 0. note that the rhs of (2.10) originates from
the chern-simons term

z c4  h rr  h nsns .

(2.12)

since the fractional d3-brane (the wrapped d5-brane) creates r-r 3-form ux through

t1,1, h rr should be proportional to the closed 3-form which was constructed in [11],

h rr  m e  (e1  e1  e2  e2 ) .

(2.13)

5 we will check later that this background has no corrections of order m/n which is the order

at which we are working.

in these coordinates, the closed form 2 which enters (2.5) is given by

2  e1  e1  e2  e2 ,

so that

eh nsns  df (r)  (e1  e1  e2  e2 ) .

since f5 = vol(ads5) + vol(t1,1), f5  h nsns = 0. let us set the r-r scalar c0 = 0.
then we see that the real part of (2.10) is satised for all f (r). from the imaginary part

we have

(2.15)

quite remarkably, our solution of type iib sugra equations has reproduced the eld
theoretic beta function for
2 n to order m/n . this establishes the gravity dual of

on n regular and m fractional d3-branes placed at the conifold singularity.

it is not hard to see that there are no other eects of order m/n : the back-reaction
of the 3-form eld strengths on the metric, dilaton and the f5 comes in at order (m/n )2.

g2
for this quantity agrees with the eld theory rg equations provided that the sum of
the anomalous dimensions, a + b, has no corrections of order m/n . this is a simple
gravitational prediction about the gauge theory. it is of further interest to study the order
(m/n )2 eects on the background and compare them with eld theory, but we postpone
these calculations for future work.

3. fractional branes in n = 2 orbifold theories.

in this section we will be concerned with the n = 2 supersymmetric orbifolds of type
iib strings. before introducing d-branes these are backgrounds of the form ir5,1  ir4/.
to write down gravity duals of fractional branes we follow the strategy used in the last
section: we rst stack a large number n of regular d3-branes creating the dual ads5 
s5/ background and then introduce the fractional branes as small perturbations on this
background. we nd an important dierence from the conifold case, however, because
s5/ does not have any nite volume 2-cycles. a blowup of this space produces 2-cycles
but breaks the n = 2 supersymmetry. for this reason we work with the singular space
where the 2-cycles are collapsed (we will see that this turns out to be simpler than the
non-singular case discussed in the previous section).

thus we consider the type iib superstring in the background ads5  s5/ where 
is one of the a,d,e subgroups of su (2) whose action on s5 is induced from the standard
action on r4  c2 times the trivial action on ir2. therefore, we get the action of  on ir6
having a xed two-plane 0  ir2. this action descends to s5 and the xed plane becomes
a xed circle s1.

the metric on s5/ reads:

ds2

5 = d2 + cos2d2 + sin2ds2

s3/ ,

(3.1)

and the xed circle is at  = 0.

string theory in this background has extra massless elds compared to the -invariant
elds of the ten dimensional iib supergravity. these elds are localized at the xed circle
s1. in the paper [13] the multiplets of the ve dimensional gauge supergravity these elds
fall in were identied.

the simple meaning of these elds is the following: if one were to blow up the xed
circle to obtain a smooth einstein metric then the topology of the resulting vefold is
such that the non-contractable two-spheres ci are supported. these spheres intersect each
other according to the dynkin diagram of the corresponding a,d,e lie group:

ci  cj = aij

now, reducing the ten dimensional supergravity elds along these cycles leads to new
elds in six dimensions spanned by s1  ads5. of particular importance for us are the
nsns and rr two-forms bnsns and brr. they give rise to the scalars:

nsns
i

= zci

bnsns,

rr

i = zci

brr

(3.2)

8

these elds are present even if one did not perform the blowup: they come from the

twisted sector of the string theory.

we now proceed with writing the eective action for these elds (here we have set the

r-r scalar to zero):

these elds transform nicely under the sl2(zz) group:

where  is the coordinate on the circle s1.

let us introduce the complex coordinate on the space transverse to ir1,3: z = rei.
we are interested in elds which have no ir1,3 dependence. for these elds the action
(3.3) takes on the following form (assuming that  is constant, otherwise we get covariant

derivatives instead of ordinary ones):

where we introduced the notation t = sin. the xed circle is at t = 0. the elds  acts
as sources for the  equations of motion. irrespectively of the precise form of (3.6) the
source term in the dilaton equation of motion is:

 (t)r5eaij(i j + i j) ,

(3.7)

(this expression is valid for c0 = 0,  = const). thus, the source term vanishes for
holomorphic  and the dilaton is allowed to remain constant. this argument may suer
from some subtleties in case of badly singular i.

fractional branes.

in string theory bnsns , brr do not have to be globally well-
dened two-forms - they behave like gauge elds. the same applies to the scalars i
in particular, if we add the k-th fractional
obtained by the reduction of the b-elds.

the solution must have a logarithmic monodromy:

one may be concerned about the appearance of the logarithm because j is dened on

the periodicity in this direction may be ignored for large n (this is because the -functions
for j are of order 1 for a nite number of fractional branes, so that the evolution of the
couplings is relatively slow).
in any event, the theory with a fractional brane may be
regulated far in the uv by adding a fractional anti-brane at large r:

this way the theory becomes conformal again for r  |zreg|. on the other hand, the
singularities of i at the locations of fractional branes are presumably removed by the
instanton corrections which will be discussed below.

instanton corrections. as the space-time dilaton is constant for the solutions we
discuss we may hope that the solutions we nd are valid, at least far away from the
locations of the fractional branes, but not too far to make some of the gauge factors
extremely strongly coupled. when we approach the branes, the log(z) behaviour  makes
the fractional d-instantons favorable. the creation amplitude of the fractional d-instanton

part of the picture which we are advocating is the possibility of having instanton corrections
coming from the instantons of each group factor. also, the appearance of the (p, q) types of
the instantons is the consequence of the s-duality non-trivially realized in the eld theories

under consideration.
