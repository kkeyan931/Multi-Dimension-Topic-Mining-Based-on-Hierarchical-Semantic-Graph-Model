abstract

using the natural extension of the notion of the generalized coherent

states the scalar and spinor ones for the de sitter group so(4, 1) are

constructed. these systems of coherent states obey the de sitter

invariant klein-gordon and dirac equations and correspond to the

massive spin 0 and 1/2 particles over de sitter space. these coherent

states are used for the construction of the invariant scalar and spinor

propagators over de sitter space.

i. introduction

generalized coherent states (cs) for the arbitrary lie group rstly introduced

by a.m.perelomov at 1972 are the powerful tool for the various physical problems.
the system of cs is composed by the overcomplete set of the vectors |i of the
some hilbert space h parametrized by the points of the some symmetric space
g/h. the most important property of the system of cs is its invariance under the
some representation of the group g acts on the space h. various general properties
of cs, its construction for the concrete spaces g/h and its applications were the
subject of numerous publications [1,2]. one of these applications is the invariant

describing of the particles in symmetric spaces. in refs. [3,4] the coherent states for
the spaces so(3, 2)/so(3) so(2) and so(4, 1)/so(3) were applied to the phase
space describing of the particles in the anti-de sitter space so(3, 2)/so(3, 1) and

de sitter (ds) space so(4, 1)/so(3, 1).

following ref. [5], in the present paper the cs for the ds and so(4, 1)/k
spaces (where k are the so-called parabolic subgroups of the ds group) are used
for the describing of the massive spin 0 and 1/2 particles over ds space. it is shown

that these cs obey the ds-invariant klein-gordon and dirac equations in ds space.

using these cs the invariant scalar and spinor two-point functions over ds space

are constructed.

the present paper is constructed as follows. in sec.ii the some necessary proper-

ties of the ds group are considered. its realizations as the group of transformations

of the lemaitre coordinate system of the ds space, its four-spinor representation
and the representation as the group of the conformal transformations of r3 space
are examined. the general classication of the irreducible representations of the

ds group is given too. sec.iii is devoted to the construction of the invariant wave

equations for the scalar and dirac particles. the ds-invariance of the klein-gordon

equation in the de sitter space is well-known; although a lot of papers were de-

voted to the invariant dirac equation over ds space (see refs. [6,7] and references

therein) this problem is not exhausted. we built the representation of the ds group

for the spin 1/2 particles starting from the general classication of the represen-

tations of the ds group; we make the distinction between the two dierent sets of

the ve-dimensional -matrices which is necessary for the obtaining of the correct

2

four-dimensional form of the dirac equation. it is shown that the obtained invari-

ant dirac equation is reduced to the general-covariant one using the some matrix

transformation.

in sec.iv we construct the systems of cs for the ds group. as

the our denition of cs is somewhat broader that the one given by a.m.perelomov

then we at rst consider the general scheme of the construction of cs. using the

representation of the ds group acts on the functions depending on the real three-

vector the two systems of cs for the ds space correspond to the particles and

antiparticles and obeys the klein-gordon equation are constructed. within the

coordinate-independent multiplier these systems of cs coincide with the so-called

plane waves in the ds space (or horospherical waves) considered in refs. [8,4].

the scalar product of the two cs coincides with the two-point function on the ds

space considered in ref. [8]. these cs are the cs in the sense of a.m.perelomov
too. using the representation of the ds group acts on the constant 4  2-matrices
we show that our extension of the notion of cs allows us to construct the cs for the
spaces so(4, 1)/k in the form of 4  2-matrices. within the common multiplier
the columns of these matrices coincides with the basic dirac spinors for particles

and antiparticles. the product of the scalar and matrix cs gives us the solution of

the ds-invariant dirac equation in the form of plane waves, which generalize the

plane waves for spin zero particles. using these spinor plane waves the invariant

spinor two-point function is constructed. it is shown that this two-point function

may be obtained by the acting of the ds-invariant spinor operator onto the some

ds-invariant scalar function.

we shall use the following types of indices: a, b, . . . = 0, . . . , 3, 5; , , . . . =

0 . . . 3; a = 1, 2, 3, 5; i, k, . . . = 1, 2, 3. the four-vector indices may be omitted;
then the dot  denotes the scalar product using the galilean metric tensor  =
diag(+1,1,1,1). the 3-vectors are picked out by the bold type.

ii. representations of the de sitter group

the ds group g = so(4, 1) is the group of the linear transformations of the
ctitious ve-dimensional real space with the coordinates xa preserves the quadratic
form abxaxb = 1, where ab = diag(+1,1, . . . ,1). hereafter we consider that
x5 = 1 + x  x > 0; then the coordinates x covers the half of the ds space and

3

the internal metric reads

g =  

xx
(x5)2

,

g =  + xx.

the action of an arbitrary element g  g of the ds group on the ds space we
denote as x 7 xg. the stationary subgroup of an arbitrary point of the ds space is
h = so(3, 1); then the ds space is the coset space g/h.

the generators of the ds group are j ab = j ba; the subgroup h is composed

by the generators j. the commutation relations are

[jab, jcd] = adjbc + bcjad  acjbd  bdjac.

let us construct the operators

it is easy to show that they compose the abelian subalgebras:


i = ji5  j0i.

[+

i , +

k ] = [

i , 

k ] = 0.

(1)

(2)

one can take the operators +, , j 50 and jik as the new set of the generators
of the ds group; we denote the subgroups generated by them as t +,t ,t 0 and
r = so(3) respectively. besides (2) the commutation relations are

[+

i , 

[

i , jkl] = 

k ] = 2j 50ik + 2jik

k il

[j 50, jik] = 0,

casimir operators:

is an analog of the pauli-lubanskis pseudovector in the poincare group.

there are two series of the so(4, 1) irreducible representations [9]:

4

(4)

(5)

1) p,q, p = 1/2, 1, 3/2, . . . ; q = p, p  1, . . . , 1 and 1/2. the values of casimir

operators in this series are

c2 = p(p + 1) + q(q  1)  2
c4 = p(p + 1)q(q  1).

(6a)

(6b)

2)  m,s. there s is spin, s = 0, 1/2, 1, . . .; m corresponds to mass. if s is integer

then m2 > 0; if s is half-integer then m2 > 1/4; if s = 0 then m2 > 2.

c2 = m2 + (s(s + 1)  2)
c4 = m2s(s + 1).

scalar representation.

its generators marked by the (l) above are the killing

vectors of the ds space:

5 = x5 
j (l)

,

j (l) = (x  x)


x .

they compose the representation  m,0 as

w (l)
a = 0  c (l)

4 = 0.

(8)

(9)

by the virtue of (2) the generators (1) in the scalar representations are the derivatives

along the some new coordinates:

(l) =



y

.

(10)

then, in the ds space the two dierent lemaitre coordinate systems may be intro-
duced. combining (8),(10) and (1) gives the connection of y and x. new time
coordinate independent from the y we denote as y0
 = ; then the transformations
from the old coordinates to the new ones are

e = x5  x0.

(11)

if one consider e as the new coordinate changes from  to  then the lemaitre
coordinates covers the full ds space. the operator j05 in the new coordinates takes
the form

j (l)
05 =

the nite transformations from the groups t  and t 0 which we denote as  and
0, act in the scalar representation as follows:

g = (a)  exp(a) : 


y 7 y
 7  
g = 0()  exp(j05) :

 = y + a

we consider that the transformations act in the order from the right to the left.

spinor representation.

its generators marked by the (s) above are the matrices

[, ].

(12)

computing the eigenvalues of the casimir operators [see (18)] gives that it is repre-
sentation 3/2,3/2. we choose the standard representation of the -matrices. then
the manifest form of the generators reads

the matrices of the nite transformations we denote as u(g); let us construct them in

the explicit form. for its obeying the same composition properties as the coordinate

transformations it is necessary to take all the parameters of the transformations with

the opposite sign regarding to the scalar representation. it is easy to show that

u((a)) = 1  (s)a
u(0()) = exp(j (s)
05 ).

conformal representation. the ds group is isomorphic to the group of the con-
formal transformations of the r3 space; its vector we denote as w. there exist two
dierent conformal realizations of the ds group; the rst one corresponds to the up-

per, and the second one to the lower sign in the followign formulas of these section

and in the formulas of sec.iv. generators takes the form

they obey the commutation relations (2),(3). the nite transformations are

g = (a) : wg =

g = (a) : wg = w  a

w + aw2

1 + 2wa + w2a2
g = 0() : wg = we.

(14)

iii. invariant wave equations

as (g)1/2 = 1/x5, for the second-order casimir operator in the representation

m,0 we obtain from (4) and (8):

c (l)
2 = (g)1/2((g)1/2g) = .

using (7a) the klein-gordon equation

 + (m2 + 2) = 0

(15)

follows. let us construct now the representation for the spin 1/2 particles. by

introducing the matrices

5 = i0123

 = i5
one can rewrite (12) in the ve-dimensional form:

,

,

5 = i5,

the equalities

j (s)ab =

[a, b].

ab + b a = 2ab

ab c = ab c + bc a  ac b +

are correct. combining (4)-(5) and (16),(17) gives

 c (s)

2 = 5/2 , w (s)

a =

a , c (s)

4 =

(17c)

(18)

making the comparison of the above expressions with (6) yields that we have obtain
the representation 3/2,3/2. the orbital part of the generators is given by the rep-
resentation  m,0; then further we shall deal with the representation 3/2,3/2  m,0
which has the generators j (l)
ab. then for the second-order casimir operators
one has

ab + j (s)

c2 = c (l)

2 + c (s)

2  j (s)abj (l)
ab.

denoting  = j (s)abj (l)

ab yields

c2 =  +  +

5

.

(19)

for the evaluation of the fourth-order casimir operator using (9),(18) and (5) one

obtains

wa =

abcde b cj (l)de +

for the squaring of wa it is necessary to use the formulas (17). the obtained result

c4 =

is consistent with (7b) and (19) at s = 1/2. as the operators  and  commutes
with the summarized generators j (l)
ab then by the virtue of the rst shurs
lemma they should have xed values in the irreducible representation. using (17)

ab + j (s)

follows

2 =

1
4

ab c dj (l)

abj (l)

cd =   3 .

so in the group theoretical approach the squared dirac operator reduces to the

dalembertian. then using the above expression and eqs. (7a),(19) we obtain the
quadratic equation for the eigenvalue of . solving it yields
 = 2  i ,  = 2  i  2,

(20)

8

where 2 = m2  1
4. as in our case m2 > 1/4 then  is a real number. the
appearance of two signs means that two identical irreducible representations are

obtained:

this is analogous to the decomposition

m,0  3/2,3/2 = 2m,1/2.

p(m,0)  (l(0,1/2)  l(1/2,0)) = 2p(m,1/2)

of the representations of the poincare group [10]. expression (8) yields

 = 

,  = x5 +

1
2

[, ]x.

choosing the representation corresponds to the lower sign in (20) we obtain the

group theoretical dirac equation in the ds space:

i  (  2i) = 0.

(21)

the above equation admits reduction to the general-covariant form. for its per-

forming let us make the transformation  = v , where

v = (1  )1/2(1 + )

,

 =

x

x5 + 1

.

then (21) passes into

iv v 1( + (v v 1))  (  2i) = 0.

it is easy to show that

v v 1 = e

()

,

 + v v 1 = d

where e()



is an orthonormal vierbein:

e() =  +

() = g

(22)

x5 + 1
and d is the spinor covariant derivative:

d =  

ge()
 .

with the choice of vierbein according to (22) the ricci rotation coecients are equal

to

g =

1

x5 + 1

(x  x).

putting everything together we obtain the general-covariant dirac equation

ie

()d = .

the another more complicated method of reduction of the group theoretic dirac

equation to the general-covariant one was proposed in ref. [7].

iv. coherent states

a. denition of coherent states

let g is the some lie group and g  g 7 t (g) is its representation on the
some linear vector space h by the operators t (g). we dene the some equivalence
relation  between the vectors of the space h obeys the reexivity and transitivity
conditions. let us consider the subgroup h  g leaves unchanged the equivalency
class of the some vector |0i  h:

h  h  t (h)|0i  |0i.

(23)

the lifting from g/h to g is the mapping g/h   7 g  g such as for the
arbitrary g1  g the equality

g1g = gh ,

h  h ,

 = g1

(24)

is correct, where  7 g is an action of g on g/h. for the construction of the
liftings the following simple method will be used. let  is the some standard
point of the g/h space. as g we denote the set of the transformations from the g
parametrized by the points of g/h and obeys the equality  = ()g. it is easily
seen that  7 g is the lifting. indeed, let g1  g is an arbitrary transformation from
the group g. then both g1g and g transforms the point  to the point  = g1;
then the transformation (g1g)1g leaves the point  in the rest and then belongs
to h. then we dene the system of cs as

|i = t (g)|0i.

10

the most important property of the set of the cs is its g-invariance follows from (23)
and (24):

t (g)|i  |gi

,

g  g.

(25)

the denition of the cs giving by a.m.perelomov [1] is the narrower than our one,
as in the a.m.perelomovs denition the equivalence relation  is the equality within
the phase:

|i  |i  |i = ei|i ,   r.

b. scalar coherent states

let us introduce two dierent representations of the ds group on the functions

depending on w:

1/3



w(g) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

wi

g1

g  t  r
1,
e,
g = 0()
1  2aw + a2w2, g = (a)

 (g)f (w) = (cid:16)
= 


where   c,  denotes the semidirect product and the action of the ds group on
the vector w is determined by (14). we denote these representations as t 
 . it is
easily seen that the generators of these representations are


w

 = 
j05 =  w

,  = w2 
w  ! ,




w

w  2w(w

wi  wi
jik = wk

(26a)

(26b)

let us introduce the scalar product in the space of the representation t 

 as follows:

hf1|f2i = zr3

d3w f 

1 (w)f2(w).

it is easy to show that it is ds-invariant if

 = 0  

3
2  i ,   r.

11

it is easily seen that the transformation

gy = (y)0()

transforms the origin of the lemaitre coordinate system to the point with the coor-

dinates y and then determines the lifting from the ds space to the ds group. as
the equivalence relation  we will take the equality. then the vector |0i lorentz-
invariant under t 

 is

|0i = (1  w2);

one can show its lorentz-invariance acting on it by the generators (26) and express-
ing j0i from + and  using (1). now we can construct cs for the representation
t 
 :

|x,; i = t 

 (gy(x))|0i,

where the lemaitre coordinates depends on x by the transformations (11). the
explicit form of the cs as functions on w reads

|x,; i  (0)

w (x; ) = (1  w2)(0)

kw (x; ),

where

transformational property

w (xg; ) = (w(g)) (0)

follow, where w = wg1.

let us consider the scalar product of two cs in the representation t 

easily seen that the scalar products in the representations t +

0 and t 

0; it is
0 are equal

12

to each other within the sign. this fact may be proved considering the inversion
 7 w/w2 which yields

w (x) 7 (w2)0(0)

then the two-point function may be dened as

the coincidence of the right hand sides of (30) and (29) is the consequence of the
2
lemma 4.1 of ref. [8]. the two-point function w (0)(
x) coincides with the one
considered in refs. [8,12]. in general, the integrals determine this function diverge
because of the function |0i dont belongs to the class of the square integrable
functions on r3. one can make these integrals meaningful by the passage to the
complex ds space [8] or to the generalized functions [12]. hereafter we shall consider

the rst method of the regularization. at that the ds-invariance of the two-point

functions preserves because of the transformation property (27) remains valid. let

us consider the domains in the complexied ds space dened as follows:

c. spinor coherent states

let us denote the constant 4 2 matrices as a, a, a and let us dene the weak

equivalence relation  and the strong one  over these matrices as

a  a  a = ab , b  gl(2, c)
a  a  a = ab , b  su(2).

(32)

let us consider the left action of the spinor representation of the ds group onto such

the subgroups k  t  (t 0  r) the vectors

where i2 is the unit 22 matrix, transforms to the vectors equivalent to the starting

ones in the sense of the weak equivalence relation.

equivalence relation one gets

u(h)|i  (

v (h))1/2|v=0|i

,

h  k.

from the other hand, it is easily seen that the subgroups k are the stationary
subgroups of the vector w = 0 under the conformal action (14) of the ds group.
this allows us to identify the space so(4, 1)/k with the r3 space of the vectors
w. as the lifting from the so(4, 1)/k to so(4, 1) we can take the transformation
which transform the origin to the point w:

so(4, 1)/k  w 7 gw = (w)  so(4, 1).

then the system of cs for the space so(4, 1)/k ds-invariant under the weak
equivalence relation is

|w+i = 


i2

w 
 ,

|wi = u(gw)|i

|wi =

using (24) the transformation property of the above cs concerning the strong equiv-

alence relation

15

u(g1)|wi  (

v (g1

follows. as the transformations t 
then the equality

 (g) compose the representation of the ds group



v (g2g1) = 

v (g2)

g1, g2  g ,

v = vg1

is correct. then combining the above equality and (24) gives



v (g1) = 

v

(g1

w

 g1gw)

,

v = vg1



w

, w = wg1.

putting v = w in the above expression we can rewrite the transformation prop-
erty (34) as

(

w(g))1/2u(g)|wg1i  |wi

,

g  g.

(35)

if w2 < 1 then within the common multiplier the columns of the matrix |w+i are
equal to the basic dirac spinor [13] for the particles, and the ones of the |wi for
the antiparticles:

|w+i = (1  w2)1/2(cid:16)u(1)(kw), u(2)(kw)(cid:17)
|wi = (1  w2)1/2(cid:16)v(1)(kw), v(2)(kw)(cid:17) .

then from the properties of the basic dirac spinors follows that the equality

(  kw  1)|wi = 0

(36)

holds for w2 < 1. further, by the virtue of the continuous dependence of |wi on w
the above expression holds for the arbitrary w. let us construct now the following
4  2-matrix functions:

(1/2)

w

(x) = (0)

w (x; 0  1/2)|wi.

using (36) gives that they obey eq. (21):

(i    + 2i)(1/2)

w

(x) = 0.

let us remove the common coordinate-independent multiplier and consider columns
of the function (1/2)

(x) separately:

w

(1/2)

w

(x)  (1  w2)0(cid:16)(1/2)

kw

(x; 1), (1/2)

kw

(x; 2)(cid:17) .

16

the functions (1/2)
(x; ), where k  k = 1, k0 > 0 and  = 1, 2, corresponds
to the particles (sign +) and antiparticles (sign ). with the limiting passage to
the minkowski space these functions pass into the usual plane waves. these so-

k

lutions are much simpler than the ones obtained by separation of variables in the

general-covariant dirac equation over ds space [14]. the transformation properties
of the states (0)
w (x; ) and |wi given by (27) and (35) yield that within the con-
stant matrix transformation the function (1/2)
(x) transforms just as the function
(0)

w (x):

then the spinor plane waves for particles and antiparticles give the same two-point

functions. let us dene the spin 1/2 two-point function as follows:
